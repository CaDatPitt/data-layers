NATE SMITH, speaking at the SU Thursday.

 

by JUDITH GALARDI

Black or white, Nate Smith
feels the same for all people.
“You are what I am. I must ac-
cept you. so you will accept me.
I love all people as I love people
I know. No one is a stranger to
me. We are all people, so we are
all a part of each other. You’re
beautiful because I’m beautiful.”

Nate Smith, co—ordinator of
Operation Dig, an Apprentice
Training Program for perspective
Negro construction workers, was
here at the University Thursday
talking on a subject relative to us
all—brotherhood.

Nate looks only to the future

for his people. “I look forward,
not backward. Look to the future
to see what you will get, don’t
bog yourself down in the sadness
of the past.”

At one instance in the lecture,
a young white man raised his
hand and asked Nate, “What do
you want us to do?” Nate smooth-
ly replied, “What do you want to
do?” He then gave the man some
advice. “You don’t walk into a
black neighborhood and make
statements, you go in and ask
questions.”Obviously the attitude
one has when trying to do any
type of social work is much more
important than the type of work
one wants to accomplish.

Oakland Co-op Accused of Fire Bomb
Infiltrating Catholic Church ExPl0d€S In
And Underrnining Morality

by RISE WEINBERG

During the last two weeks the
Oakland Co-operative Association
has been holding open forums to
discuss its problems, failures, and
future.

The Association was formed in
September, 1967. to provide a va-
riety of facilities at low costs to
students and Oakland residents.
Among these facilities were a
bookstore, a grocery store. an
avant-garde theater, a c o ffe e
house, and apartments.

Funds for the Association have
come through membership dues
and several dances and concerts.
The Association is chartered by
the State of Pennsylvania.

Difficulties have d e v e l o p e d
around the Association’s attempt
to rent a building for its activ-
ities. A church and parish house
on Bates and Atwood Sts. in lower
Oakland became available for the
group.

In order to rent the church and
convert it into a co-op, the_Asso-
ciation required an Occupancy
Permit from the city’s Board of
Adjustment. This permit is neces-
sary according to Pittsburgh’s zon-
ing ordinances.

Approximately 100 Oakland res-
idents signed petitions critical of
the proposed uses of the church.
Also a number of malicious ru-
mors and slanderous letters were

circulated in the neighborhood of
the church. An anonymous letter.
printed on University of Pitts-
burgh stationery, accused the As-
sociation of being “a Communis-
tic and anti—Catholic service as-
sociation.”

This letter was highly anti—se—
mitic and anti-student. It accused
the members of the Association of
uniting the Jews to “join the
Catholic Church for the purpose
of infiltrating it and bringing
about its destruction.” The letter
also wrongly cited the proposed
uses of the church as providing
“liquors, beer, women, and bed-
rooms. . . tax free.”

Police Van

A sign of the times.

A University police van was fire
bombed last Friday morning at
1:52 a.m. for no apparent reason.

The two officers in the vehicle
stopped at Varsity Hall to snack.
A window of the truck was left
open. While the men were inside
the building, two molotov cock-
tails were thrown through the
window of the van.

A fire broke out in the truck
that was quickly extinguished by
the University police. Damage
was estimated at $1,500.

The city’s arson and bomb
squad is currently investigating
the case.

Personnel Dicvision Here Recruits
Blacks for Campus. Employment

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The Personnel Division of the
University is making an effort to
improve the black employment
situation on campus.

According to Roy Abernethy.
University employment manager.
the emphasis is on education and
advancement of blacks from the
ranks of the unskilled to the skill-
ed.

Several methods have been em-
ployed by the Personnel Division
to reach these ends. The manager
spoke of the efforts of his depart-
ment to operate through the aus-
pices of governmental and urban
agencies. Another m e t h o d was
newspaper advertising.

The “Courier,” a local newspa-
per printed in the Hill District, is
one example. It has been running
ads from the Personnel Division,
advertising the University’s need
for skilled black workers.

Another idea was to discontinue
use of the Wunderlic Intelligence
Test. This test was thought to be

5
i lr .

culturally - biased against hard-
core people, both black and white.

A poster campaign has recent-
ly been initiated by Abernethy.
To be spread throughout the pre-
dominantly black sections of the
city to recruit secretaries.

The posters promise competi-
tive salaries, health in s u r a n c e
plans and tuition benefits to quali-
fied blacks. A further incentive
rests in “opportunities to partici-
pate in the extra-curricular activ-
ities of academic life.”

It is hoped that the influence of
campus life will encourage black
University employees to take ad-
vantage of the reduced tuition
benefits. The tuition decreases is
applicable to their children. also.

Thejobs available in the secre-
tarial division range from admin-
istrative and executive secretaries
to clerk t_vpists.

Abernethy discussed the pur-
poses of the accelerated programs.

“I’m completely in support of
the idea of the University as an

active agency in the community.”
he affirmed. “Instead of the Uni-
versity being an ivory tower. it
should take steps to remedy the
employment problem.”

“Although, at first. we had trou-
ble in getting qualified people
out. we’ve been having a big turn-
out lately.” continued the young
manager. leaning back in his
chair.

“We expect to triple the num-
ber of qualified blacks this month
for clerical positions alone,” he
said. “As well, the University is
trying to increase black employ-
ment in all areas.”

A Duke University a l u m n u s.

Abernethy outlined his depart-
ments broad goals.

“One is the movement of blacks
from unskilled jobs to skilled
ones." he explained. “A second
goal involves the creation of more
unskilled jobs with the possibility
for training and progression into
skilled positions.

The federally - sponsored j o b
training programs now operating

are not completely successful, ac-
cording to Abernethy.

“The job training programs are
trying to turn out more reliable
workers from h a r d — c o r e back-
grounds a n d with hard - core
mores.” he postulated. “They are
concentrating on reorienting hard-
core workers towards job-oriented
values. However, they assign low-
er priority to skilled training of
these hard-core unskilled for skill-
ed positions.”

The University’s a t t e m pt to
provide relief for the employment
situation in the city stem from the
recognition of its prominence as a
source of jobs. In the clerical and
secretarial fields. for example, the
University is the largest employ-
er in the Pittsburgh area. It pro-
vides more than 13,000 positions a
year, according to official sources.

Its need is growing at an ex-
pansion rate of 18 per cent per
year.

The efforts of the Personnel Di-
vision mirror those of the Univer-
sity Committee on Racism (UCR).

Smith Looks to Future,
Explains ‘Operation Dig’  

The development of Operation
Dig was then explained by Mr.
Smith. “The operation is part of
the Pittsburgh Community Action
Program. It is an apprentice train-
ing program managed by blacks.
“We have a -386,000 grant from
the US Labor Department and
$100,000 from the Allegheny
County Construction Union. The
pay is $2.50 per hour while the
man is learning his skill. After
training, the workers get a diplo-
ma, plus a job in the construction
union for at least one year. This
is a heavy machine operator train-
ing program. This is the way I
started out, and I still get the
same wages for the job I’m doing

    

A Phoby Si
NATE SMITH looks to the fu-
ture of his people.

now as I would as a machine op-
erator.”

A worker from “Dig” gave his
views on the operation. “Each op-
erator is a working man. There’s
no racial problem. If there’s some-
thing I want to learn they will
teach me.”

When asked what inspired him
to take this task upon himself,
Nate answered, “I inspired my-
self. I got what I wanted for my-
self, so now I can help get it for
other people. What's good for me
is good for my brothers.”

 

Love, concern, and understand-
ing was the title of the meeting.
Nate explained the reason for this
topic. “When Father Kennedy
(an Oratory priest) called me, he
asked what I would like to talk
about. I told him my ideas were
all about love, concern and un-
derstanding. He made that the
topic.”

At an interview with the Pitt
News, Nate expressed his ideas.
“If I’m not concerned with my-
self, or understand myself, or love
myself, I can’t love anyone else.
Ican’t give you what I don’t have.
I think love is a true miracle. If
there is a God, this God is love.
Love is the most precious thing
you can have.”

If you should ever see Nate
Smith on the street, and have a
chance to talk with him, don’t
wish him good luck. He would
easily reply, “I don’t believe in
good luck, only hard work.” Nate
Smith is now in a position where
his ‘hard work is finally paying
off.

Dental Clinic
Has Program

The University Dental Clinic
hosted a health care and educa-
tion conference Thursday through
Saturday. Its purpose was to ex-
amine a new on-the-site training
program for health care workers
in countries with limited services
and facilities.

The designers of the program
forsee a need for special programs
in underdeveloped countries. The
new program makes extensive use
of visual instructions. The confer-
ence will evaluate the program as
a method of teaching dental tech-
niques to dental auxiliaries in a
26 week period of concentrated
instruction. and will analyze it
with a view to making it univer-

sally applicable.

f Reorganization

A Research Plan

by PAUL STOLLER
Pitt News Editor

We are living in a time of change—a time when this socie-
ty must transform itself in order to cope with the new and
most taxing needs of our changing world.

Being a microcasm of society the University must also
be aware‘ of the need for fundamental change in society.
And one area of stagnation is the very foundation upon which
the University is built. The structure of this University is an-
achronistic to the «times. Students have evolved from the
“chicken livered” “silent generation” to become vocal and re-
sponsible citizens in the university communities across the
nation. But as Dr. Posvar readily admits,
students don’t have enough sav in decisions
that effect the journey of their college.
careers. Thus, new structures at the Univer-
sity must be created to insure students of
their rights—the right to govern and vote on
social rules, policy and curriculum.

_One..proposal to restructure the Univer-
sity would be to reorganize the decision
making organs in the colleges by creating
College Councils. These councils would set
policy and curriculum in the various col-
leges at the University. This rather decen-
tralized structure would gain cohesion by the formation
of a University Council—a high level body that would de-
bate and discuss university wide policy that would affect all

STOLLER

' the constituents in the University Community. This body

would produce a needed dialogue between students, faculty
and administrators; it would insure a diversity of viewpoints
on the policy level of deliberation. .

But this is merely one of the many proposals for a gen-
eral restructuring of the University. Some administrators and
students have conceived other plans that would restructure
this institution. But these varied proposals have vet to be-
come a codified plan for action. And the needed restructur-
ing of the University will never be implemented unless some
sort of research pattern or group is instituted to study the re-
orgahization of the administrative and governing structures
here at the University.

A very significant study plan has been instituted at Col-
umbia University. Administrators. faculty, and students have
formed organizations there to research and study the reorgan-
ization of the University.

The Columbia students have formed Students for a Re-
structured University (SRC). SRU Leader John Thoms says
that a “free University is the vanguard of a free society.”
Thoms is a Ph.D. candidate in English. The SRU has received
some $35,000 in funds from various foundations to aid the or-
ganization in its study. It is rallying around those students
who are unhappy with Columbia’s trustees. Essentially, the
organization is geared to all students who want a basic
change at Columbia. Consequently, the SRU has gained
widespread legitimacy from the student body.

The SRU intends to explore the existing operation at

Columbia and how it operates, the structures of other univer-
sity and the relationship of urban universities to city prob-

August Rainstorm May Not
Bring November Flowers

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

August will be a rainstorm in American His-
tory. Things may cool-off after it’s over. but some-
timesafter a downpour. it just gets hotter. Terribly
hotter.

August is the month of conventions. It is the
time when the two political parties allow the people
the privilege of voting for the party candidate.

And this year. if a man who is wanted by the
people doesn't make it through the trials in Miami
and Chicago. one cynical political observer said.
“it may be a hot winter.”

NOW, WHAT IS needed by the people more
than anything. is staunch man. Americans don't
want a party man. Naturally. the political spoils
follow any winner. But a political-party-backed
candidate just seems to have that many more of
trailers.

The late Senator Robert Kennedy. the man of
the majority-minority. would have been the rabble-
rouser this country needs. But he is history. and the
man now needed is different in many ways.

The man. looking at all the candidates. could
be one of two: Governor Nelson Rockefeller or Sen-
ator Eugene McCarthy.

What the people want more than anything is
a man they can respect. They are craving for a man
who can make a fist to fight with. write his name

to laws to correct America with. and to be a leaperi

THE MAN MUST be like a frontiersman: he
must want to accept the challenge of not only the
next four years. but also of a plan to right America
for the future.

Gov. Rockefeller is richer as a man than as a
corporation: he‘s the brawny thinker who will tell
it like it is. .

Sen. McCarthy is a man who the people gould
respect; he’s the gray beard whose wisdom would
make unrest seem like nothing.

But after the conventions. what will they be
doing. Could they fight so far. and so hard. only
to be turned—away because of political maneuvers?
Could they be the most popular also-rans since
Adlai Stevenson?

REALISTICALLY, probably neither will junk
their parties if either Vice-President Hubert Hum-
phrey or Richard Nixon are chosen to run for Presi-
dent. Their arguments and platforms will. however.
help to direct the political-party’s choice.

If they did. it seems that there would be a
greater division than there is now in this country.
(Halves lead to a whole much easier than quarters).

Both minority candidates have painted a clearer
picture for the populace; at least clearer than

both Vice-President Humphrey and Nixon.

And it would be a great wrong not to have the
choice of at least one of them after the sky clears.
and after the storm clouds disappear.

Editor. The Pitt News

The letter signed by Miss Bar-
bara Sargent (Pitt News of
July 12) represents white racism.
She begins her letter with a con-
fession of ignorance as far as

“racist" documents are concerned.

the very subject she is talking
about. Miss Sargent is comparing
the Nazi theorists, with the BAS.
But it indicates that either she is
completely ignorant of the essen-
tial tenets of Nazi idealogy or that

' she is prepared to go to any ex-

treme of factual and historical
distortion in order to attack and
vilify the BAS and Black people
generally. She completely ignores
the basic premise of the docu-
ment. namely. that the “Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has failed to
meet and understand the funda-
mental needs of Black people. It
is easy to see how Miss Sargent
can proceed to her conclusion
regarding the BAS.

Mis Sargent claims to be an
authority in reading the mind of
Black people. To wit. she pre-
dicts that “If the color involved
were white. the authors of the

document would have no diffi-
culty in identifying the criterion
involved as “white racism” ignor-
ing for the moment the fact that
there is no need for a hypothesis
here. since it is precisely this
existent white racist structure
that the BAS is attacking. I sub-
mit that in her very letter. Miss
Sargent‘s competence as inter-
preter of the Black mind is dis-
qualified.

Her letter is graphic illus-
ion of her unwillingness to under-
stand the Black man’s situation.
Miss Sargent needs some academ-
ic and intellectual advice in un-
derstanding the BAS document.

Miss Sargent should realize
that the University of Pittsburgh
does not consider the“BAS just
Another Racist Group." A num
ber of demands have been and
will be implemented. Some had
been considered by the Universi-
ty even before the formation of
the BAS.

Miss Sargent should read the
report of the Ad Hoc Faculty
Committee. This Faculty body de-
clared the University to be a

responsibility on short notice.

The BAS demands are genuine.
the university recognizes them
as such and indeed has taken pos-
itive steps to implement some of
them. If anything these bodies
can serve as channels of commu-
nication. The stand taken by Pitt
News on this issue deserves spec-
ial praise.

Finally I would like to say
that a real understanding of the
BAS document can be achieved,
neither by attempting to smother
it with praise and ‘paternalistic
tolerance nor by denigrating it
but rather by using it as a spring-
board to the engagement in an
honest. vigorous, and enlightened
evaluation of the fundamental
issues raised.

Essentially the BAS presented
demands some of which have al-
ready been implemented. What
is racial about a group represent-
ing demands? Black or no Black?

“Have Change Ready,” PAT

Bus Driver Tells Commuters.
Ready-fare Plan Instituted

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

I am a commuter. There are lot
of us enrolled in the University.
We m a k e t h e University t h e
"moving" place that it is.

Recently. something has oc-
curre,d__W_h_i,ch_ drastically affects
gus. The PAT bus
service has de-
ﬁelded that it will
, ccept only exact
ichange for fares.
This “ready-fare"

 lan began last
Tuesday at 12:01.

The reasons for the change are
sound. There have been several
robberies of PAT buses recently.
The drivers were injured. in one
case. fatally.

The untapped attitudes of the
drivers themselves toward the new
program interested me. Therefore,
when a driver and a commuter
struck up a conversation on the
subject, I discreetly recorded it.

 
  
 
 
 
 
  

The episode took place Monday
night. I was making one of my
20 weekly bus rides to and from
Oakland when the 61B stopped at
Carnegie—Mel1on University to
pick up a passenger.

The passenger turned out to be
brief case - carrying professional
type with brown hair and a strik-
ing red beard. He sat down oppo-
site me and proceeded to an-
nounce to the underpopulated bus
that he needed change for a quar-
ter.

Since no one could oblige him,
the garrulous, graying bus driv-
er spoke up. The dialogue be-
tween the two went as follows:

—“How do you bus drivers like
this new plan‘? I guess it makes
your job safer."
tween the two went as follows:

—-“You're in luck. I can give you
change. but this is the last time.
I’m turning in the money in a
couple of hours.”

Points Out New Opportunities

—-"How do you bus drivers like
this new plan? I guess it makes
your job safer.“

—“Oh, yeah. We like it. You
know, in the past three weeks,
three of our men have been shot
up and killed. Three more got
knocked off last night. Why
should we risk our lives for a
lousy 40 bucks?”

—“I think that you guys have
more dangerous jobs than police-
men.“

-—“I know I’m damn anxious to
get rid of this money. all right.
It’s going to be a pain in the neck
for a few days. though. People
will forget.”

—“What happens when they for-
get?”

—“We give them a receipt for
the change. They can pick it up
in the city office.”

The University School of Medicine
Begins Program for Black Students

The University School of Medi-
cine has initiated a Medical Ca-
reer Orientation Program for
Black high school students from
local communities.

Fourteen s t u d e n t s , each of
whom is under the supervision of
a faculty member of the School of
Health or an affiliated hospital,
have been selected by commun-
ity representatives. The students
are enrolled in a ten-week train-
ing program in research and clin-
ical laboratories in the Schools of
the Health Professions where they
will acquire skills in basic medi-
cal technology.

The program is being supported
by a $15,000 grant from the Maur-
ice Falk Medical Fund of Pitts-
burgh, and is under the direction
of Dr. Raymond L. Hayes, Jr.,
assistant professor of Anatomy and
Cell Biology in the School of
Medicine. Miss Sheila Douglas
of the same department is the as-
sistant director.

Experience Sensational

Hendrix Group Vibrates

by JUDITH GALARDI

“Are you experienced." asks Jimi Hendrix on his first album. If
you are. you'll probably like the Jimi Hendrix Experience. If you are
not. he can help you reach this height of intelligence.

Hendrix isn't only a listening experience. hes a sensual one. In
following his voice. you‘ll find that it travels from one speaker to an-
other. because Hendrix travels from one microphone to another. The
sounds he produces cause a sensation in your body that can only other-
wise be produced by outside physical sensations. Jimi Hendrix is a
physical sensation.

Hendrix looks. acts and sounds like a psychedelic experience. The
Jimi Hendrix Experience is comprised of Mitch Mitchell. the drum-
mer. and Noel redding. the second guitarist. Jimi Hendrix. the lead
singer and guitarist. plays his instrument in a larger variey of posi-
tions than anyone else before him. One of his most famous positions is
plucking his guitar strings with his teeth.

Asked recently why he has such weird sounds in his songs, Hen-
drix retorted, “They want to hear weird sounds, so I give them weird
sounds.” Jimi is known to use as many as 18 amplifiers at his concerts
and recording sessions.

On the album “Are You Experienced?" are songs like “Hey Joe,”
a song written by Billy Roberts. and previously performed by the
“Love.” “Foxy Lady” and the title song “Are You Experienced?”
which were both written by Hendrix.

To see the group you would know why they call themselves the
 . . Experience.” Each man wears his hair in the “electrifying”
style. That is. their hair looks like its trying to tear away from their
scalps in all directions. Their clothes vary from the “fluorescent-
sheen” colors to lace and ruffled blouses.

 

The University is now the na-
tion’s 87th largest contributor
of Peace Corps volunteers. The
latest statistics show that 70 vol-
unteers from Pittsburgh have
been selected for Peace Corps
assignments.

Of the nation’s 2,800 colleges
and universities, three other
Pennsylvania s c h o o l s : Penn
State, Penn, and Temple, also
fall into the top 100 Peace Corps
producers.

ACLU Criticizes Demonstration

NEW YORK (CPS)—The Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union issued
a strong statement on campus
demonstrations this week which
criticizes students, faculties, and
administrations alike.

The statement calls for a re-
view of the structure and internal
relations of the university on ev-
ery campus,” and says universi-
ties should involve all concerned
groups in the development and
execution of academic policy at
every level. The statement is the
result of a survey of recent cam-
pus disruptions by the ACLU’s
Academic Freedom Committee.

In its sweeping indictment, the
statement says, “On many cam-
puses there have been grave vio-
lations of the principles of sound
academic governance by admin-

Objectivism

by DIANE GOODAVAGE

The only way to prevent our so-
ciety from becoming totalitarian
like Nazi Germany is for every-
one to become an objectivist. Ob-
jectivism is in every phase the
complete antithesis of Nazism.

This theory was presented by
Dr. Leonard Peinoff in the last of
a series of taped lectures Friday
night. Peikoff is a member of the
Nathaniel Branden Institute, the
sponsor of the lectures.

At the beginning of the lecture,
Dr. Peikoff asks of the Third
Reich, “Why? What for‘? — For
the answer, perhaps we should
turn to the concentration camps.”
He then spent an hour on a gruel-
ing and detailed account of the
atrocities of the concentration
camps.

The concentration camps serv-
ed no practical economic or po-
litical purpose, according to Peik-
off, since they actually wasted a
lot of money, and since any serv-
ice or labor that was performed
by the prisoners could have been

istrations which have denied stu-
dents reasonable participation in
matters of university policy in
which their interests have been
clearly involved. by faculties
which have been indifferent to the
needs and aspirations of students.
and by students who by various
actions have interfered with the
processes of teaching, learning,
and the right to free speech.”

The civil liberties group, how-
ever, admitted that “an examin-
ation of the conditions which have
triggered demonstrations shows
that in a majority of cases stu-
dents have had a prima facie jus-
tification for their concern, if not
for their manner of expressing it.
As examples, the statement points
out that students have protested
against compulsory ROTC, the

performed more cheaply and bet-
ter by other means.

He said that the only reason
the concentration camps existed
was so that they could turn citi-
zens into pawns or slaves who
would do the bidding of their
Fuehrer without question, since
this acquisescent obedience is the
basis of a totalitarianism.

Dr. Peikoff presented four as-
pects of a person’s soul. or per-
sonality that the camps aimed at
obliterating, in order to obliterate
spontaneity: his sense of rights, or
juridical sense; his morality; his‘
sense of reality; his sense of rea-
son. A person’s sense of rights is
the thing that tells him whether
or not someone has a right to do
something. Therefore, when a cit-
izen who is completely innocent
of any political or other crime is
punished and beaten brutally and
endlessly, his juridical sense is
violated. Eventually, after enough
humiliation and punishment for no
reason whatsover, the citizen’s
juridical sense simply fades away,
“so that he can no longer de-

suspension of politically acitve
students, the neglect of black stu-
dents, a n d th e mistreatment of
controversial faculty members.

The ACLU charges that passive
faculties have allowed most of the
power in the university to pass
into the hands of the administra-
tion. and “the administration has
been only too ready to accept this
power and to exercise it in an es-
sentially managerial wayj with
little regard for the characteristic
intellectual and social realities of

academic life. It is a significant

fact that many university admin-
istrators are as much at home on
the boards of large corporations
and in the upper echelons of the
bureaucracy as they are on their
campuses.”

The statement levels a bitter at-

nounce you for your treatment of
him.”

After this account of Gestapo
methods, Dr. Peikoff said that our
American culture is headed for
the same thing, as demonstrated
bv the riots,« which are totally

ta c k a g a i n st administrations
which have called police onto
their campuses to break up stu-
dent protests. “The invitation of
civil authorities onto the campus
endangers the autonomy of the in-
stitution. and should be resorted
to only when all other avenues
have failed and then preferably
under strict procedural rules laid
down and agreed to by adminis-
tration, faculty. and students,"
the statements says.

It adds, “In view of the brutal-
ity of some police actions, the for-
mulation of such rules appears to
be a matter of urgent priority.”

The civil liberties goup, how-
ever, condemns the tactics of stu-
dent protesters which result in the
police being called in. I
