Arms GroupMeet

The Arms Race Study Group
will meet at noon on Tuesday,

-Sept. 21, in Room 501 of the

Cathedral. Professor John
Townsend will lead the discus-
sion of how the topic of nuclear
war can be appropriately and
effectively introduced in the
college classroom.

The group invites faculty
members who have incorpo-
rated this subject in their teach-
ing to come and share their
experiences and also welcomes
students’ perspective on the
subject.

Townsend has assembled a
large file of curriculum mate-
rials and syllabi on the subject
from various colleges and uni-
versities, which he is happy to
share with anyone interested.

Panthers
Drown

Florida

By scorr DELLETI

TALLAHASSEE, FLA.—The
hopes for a national championship
were fading faster than the summer
weather. The Florida State Semi-
noles took a quick 10-0 lead in the
first quarter, and the Panthers
looked worried. The Panthers were
thoroughly outplayed by the Semi-
noles, and the crowd-—one of the
most vocal crowds in college
football—was screaming its lungs
GUI.

But Pitt showed the stuff neces-
sary for top-ranked teams, regained
their composure, and, with some
help fromrMother Nature, sailed by
Florida State 37-17.

From the beginning, it was evi-
dent that the Seminoles were going
to repay the Panthers for their 42-14
smashing last season at Pitt Sta-
dium. Revenge was in the eyes of
the Florida State playrs and the
record crowd of 56,236, and from
the way the Seminoles played in
the first quarter, they were going to
get their satisfaction.

When Eric Schubert's opening

kickoff went into the end zone for "

touchback, the Seminoles started to
exploit Pitt's pass defense. After
two near misses, Florida State
quarterback Blair Williams hit

Fraternity Flu/es Restrict Open Parties

By GREG PETRO

The university is prohibiting
Pitt fraternities from advertising
their open parties and from charg-
ing admission to them after discov-
ering such actions violate a city
ordinance.

City regulations state that organ-
izations advertising and charging
admission to parties must have a
mercantile and entertainment
license, pay an amusement tax on
any profits made, obtain a dance

permit and have the location
inspected by the Bureau of
Inspections.

Pitt fraternities have for the past
several years advertised their par-
ties in school papers and by distri-
buting flyers. They often hire
bands and charge a few dollars for
admission at the door.

The city was contacted about the
violation by residents of Bayard

Street, where several fraternity
houses are located, Greek Advisor
Lou-is McLindon said. Flyers

advertising parties were placed on
the windshields of cars parked on
that street, he said.

Once informed of the regula-
tions by the city, the Office of Stu-
dent Activities created a new policy
governing fraternity parties. In
addition to the ban on advertising
and admission fees, the policy
requires that: '

0 all social activities at a frater-
nity party be by invitation only;

0 one list with all fraternity
functions for rush be published
once per term.

The Interfraternity Council also

_issued new rules for rush p,a,rti_es.,

Only freshmen and sophomores
are permitted to get rush cards.
Under the new rules, if a junior or
senior wants a card he must be
sponsored by a fraternity.
Interfraternity ‘Council presi-
dent Randy Bardol said that
because of the new policy, most fra-
ternities will cut the number of
people they admit to their parties

and will honor only rush cards.

“It will make rush a much more
cost-effective operation because we
will be able to identify the market
of prospective pledges easier" Bar-
do] said. “Also, it will decrease the
cost per pledge.”

“I feel that fraternity rush will
benefit greatly from the changes
because they will limit the number

of men attending rush functions
who are not interested in partici-

. pating in the Greek system,” addegl

Greg Kunkel, Interfraternity
Council rush chairman.

The Interfraternity Council will
be responsible for enforcing the"
policies, McLindon said. Should it
fail,.the university will step in, he
added. A

International
Affairs
Forum

By RAY WUSLICH

When it comes to issues of
international concern, how
aware are you? Not very, accord-
ing to Tom Wanko, president
of Pitt's International Affairs
Forum, a newly recognized stu-
dent organization.

“Studies have shown that
Americans are less aware of
international issues and how
they relate to them than citizens
of other developed countries,”
said Wanko.

New Grou

ps on Pitt Campus

The International Affairs
Forum is a student organization
whose purpose is to address pol-
itical questions of an interna-
tional nature.

“We want to raise the student
consciousness of international
issues. We feel that in these
times of international crisis it is
important for students to be
aware of what’s going on,”
Wanko continued. ’

The group tries to view inter-

national affairs from an intel-
lectual, rather than political,
perspective. They are not likely
to be seen carrying placards in
the streets.

“We hope to sponsor speak-
ers, debates and forums on
issues of current international
political significance," Wanko
said.

The group is also planning

" of such international organiza-

two trips for members to par-*
take ‘ in model international
organization conventions spon-
sored by Yale and Georgetown
Universities. .
The trip to Yale will take
place at the end of October and
will offer members the oppor-
tunity to simulate the workings

tions as the World Court and
the U.N. Security Council.

In March of next year, the
group plans to visit Washing-
ton D.C. for the model O.A.S.
convention sponsored by Geor-
getown University. “The trip to
Georgetown last year was a
learning experience,” said Liz
Cooke, the group’s business
manager. “We got to meet a lot
of new people, and it was really
a lot of fun."

The Experience of Being a New Student
Three Reflect on Their Progress at Pitt So Far 

‘ By LAURIE MocLEOD

Starting college at a large
urban campus like Pitt can  a
confusing and frightening
experience for freshmen and
transfer students alike. The fall

term is three weeks old and .
today's Profile~deals.with three 5
new students and how well they
are adjusting to life at Pitt.

For sophomore transfer stu-
dent John Houston, coming to
Pitt meant leaving a small, all:
male college “in the middle ofa
co_r_n_f_ield'_’_f_or an urban school
with a diversity of people‘and
things to do.

Houston transferred here
from St. Vincent College, a lib-
eral arts college in rural West-

he said.

“Pitt’s an interesting place
and there's a lot more to it
because it stretches through the
city,” he said.

Houston, originally from
Lower Burrell, said Pitt is closer
to his home and his mother is a
Pitt teacher.

Because my mother is a
teacher at Pitt, I've been around
the camp_us all my life,’__’ he said.
It wasn't hard for him to adjust
to Pitt’s campus. \

Houston commute_s now, but
he doesn’t believe it prevents
him from getting involved in
activities.

“You can get involved in
activities if you want to, but at
Pitt it’s easy to miss things

United States several times

although she has only been here
a few weeks, she's already
visited many of Pittsburgh’s
culture spots such as Highland
Park Zoo, movies, Carnegie
Museum and shopping centers.

“I’m a very active person and
have to be moving around. At
Pitt, there are always places to
go.”»she said.

Prats came to Pitt because she
won an academic scholarship
through her father’s company,
International Telephone and
Telegraph, which is offered to
only'50 students throughout the
United States and Puerto Rico.

about 35 in high school. She
said she doesn’t like them
because students can’t partici-
pate in the class because the
professor is always lecturing.

She also said she didn’t like
recitations with her foreign TA
because he speaks English
poorly, and she can’t’under-
stand him. She said he was
never really prepared for class.

Prats said there are 11 other
‘Puerto Rican students at Pitt,
and she knows them all. She
knew none of them when she
first came to Pitt.

Although she doesn’t belong
to a sorority, she lives in Amos
Hall and likes it because the
suites are much bigger than the

she can’t close to the
professor.

“The professors move at a
’much faster pace than in high
school and if you don’t do the

reading they don’t really care,”

In high school she partici-

the track team to stay in shape, grx

very competitive and serious.
Nordini lives in Amos Hall
and is satisfied with the dorm

been more difficult to meet peo-
ple living in an apartment.

was a major in engineering.

He described St. Vincent as.
an “enclosed campus,” which is
one reason why he transferred.

“Everyone always knew what
you were doing. If you got a bad
grade in a class, the other
teachers knew about it,” he '
said.

Houston said he doesn’t
mind the large classes here
because “you can get lost in the
crowd.”

He said there were never any
big social events at St. Vincent,
_compared to what Pitt offers.

I ' “The only thing to do at St.

Vincent was to drink, and the
students only had the girls from
nearby Seton Hill to mix with,”

because it’s so big,” he said.

When Houston went. to St.
Vincent, he worked on the col-.
lege paper as cartoonist and
photographer, and helped form
a successful ski club. Here at
Pitt, he works as photographer
and cartoonist for The Pitt
News and would like to become
involved in the ski club.

He said he changed his major
from engineering when he
came to Pitt because he didn’t
like it. “It’s not that I didn’t do
well. Ij-ust didn’t enjoy it.” he
said. He is now majoring in his-

Freshman Magda Prats is a
well-travelled person. A Puerto
Rican native, she visited the

she only plans to go to Pitt for
two years, then transfer back to
Puerto Rico because there, only
two years of college are needed
for entry into dental school.

She said she hasn’t run into
many problems at Pitt because
Puerto Rico uses the same
money as the United States.
Language hasn’t been a prob-
lem because she had severa-l
years of English in elementary
and high school.

Prats said she had a slight
problem with bureaucracy
when paying her tuition but
other than that, she says, “I’m
okay.”

She said that when she had
her first class she was surprised
at the number of students in the

towers’ rooms.

In high school, Prats partici-
pated in track and field and was
president of the Sobality club, a
committee of girls who provide
services to the community.

She said she only plans on
getting involved in the Dental

_‘ Science Club at Pitt.

For Grace Nordini, adjusting
to Pitt’s size and urban setting
was not a problem.

Nordini’s high school class
numbered about 500 and she
comes from Devon, ‘a fairly
large suburb of Philadelphia.

She said, however, that the
big lecture classes intimidate
her a little because she believes

doesn’t room with any of them.

She said she hasn’t had any
bad experiences or problems at
Pitt so far, but she often hears
people complaining about
closed classes or bills getting
“messed up.”

“I guess I’vejust been lucky,"
she said. s

Nordini said she chose Pitt
over Penn State because of the
diversity of people and also
because Pitt is strongly
acclaimed with computer
science, pre-med and language,
her areas of interest.

“There’s a lot to do if you
were to look for it,” she said,
“but no one’s going to knock on
your door telling you what Pitt
has to offer.”

Omicron
Phi

By COLETTE FERRIS

Pitt’s chapter of the education
honorary society Kappa Delta Pi
began a project this month to
inform the public that America's -
educational sysem is a good one.

Omicron Phi, Pitt's chapter, cur-
rently has a membership of 55 stu-
dents majoring in education, plus
faculty members and alumni
involved in the project—called
“The Good Schools Project.”

According to Carol Kennedy,
secretary of the organization, the
purpose of the project is to high-
light practices in education exer-
cised by elementary and secondary
schools in Allegheny County that
comply with the criteria set by
Omicron Phi.

The project, Kennedy said, is
based on a three-phase system: the.

identification of “good" schools, a
survey of the schools identified as
good andafollow-upinvestigation
of some of them.

The project stemmed from the
negative public attitude towards
the overall educational system,
Kennedy said.

“The Good Schools Project is
saying ‘Hey, we do have good
schools and we’ll prove it,’ ”
Kennedy said.

The No. 1 school selected by the
program committee will serve as a
model “good school" for schools
considering alterations in their
programs.

Kennedy said she believes the
project is important because it will
set the stage for other projects pro-
moted by Omicron Kappa Delta Pi
for Omicron Phi.

Catherine Cornbleth, director of
secondary education at Pitt, is the
director of Omicron Phi. The
dean of education, James Kelly, is
one of the 23 faculty members
involved in the organization.
Other members include 19 doctoral
students, two graduate students
and seven alumni.

Kennedy said the organization is
open to to students in the educa-
tion field who have a strong com-
mitment to education.

Omicron Phi also plans to have
monthly seminars on education-
related topics. The completion of
“The Good Schools Project" is not
expected until May of 1983.

German-
American

National
Congress

By PEGGY FERRI

The Deutsch-Amerikanischer
National Kongress (the German-
American National Congress or
D.A.N.K. for short) is actively
involved in commemorating the
300th anniversary of the relation-
ship between Germans and
Americans.

D.A.N.K. is nota studentorgani—
zation. but according to vice presi-

I

dent Dr. Marianne Bouvier, the
organization is planning to have a
youth group soon. She welcomes
students and other youth to join
D.A.N.K., and says that she will
waive the initiation fee for stu-
dents. The group presently meets
on the second Friday of every
month at 8 p.in. in the German
Nationality'Room.

The preservation of cultural and
ethnic traditions is one of
D.A.N.K.'s major goals. As the
largest German-American organi-
zation in the United States,
D.A.N.K. tries to promote a true
picture of German accomplish-
ments in the U.S. and the world,
and fosters the friendship between
the U.S. and Germany, according
to D.A.N.K. literature.

Each of D.A.N.K.'s 58 chapters
sponsors its own activities. The
Pittsburgh chapter, which consists
of over 300 members, sponsored a
Sept. 19 lecture on Johann Wolf-
gang von Goethe to coincide with
the 150 year Goethe celebration.
The lecture and slide presentation
entitled. “Goethe: A Universal
Genius His Impact on America,

New Groups Cropping Up On And Around Campus

1832-1982,” were given by author
and lecturer Dr. Christine Totten.
In addition to a distinguished
background in Germanic studies,
Totten’s enthusiasm for the works
of Goethe is almostoverwhelming. 

Totten’s lecture on Sunday was
meant to convey a general under-
standing of Goethe, but on Oct. 31,
Totten will return to Pitt to speak
about Goethe's personal life and
his scandalous (for his time) love
life. She will be accompanied by
Mildred Posvar, wife of Pitt chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar, who will sing
some of Goethe’s poetry put to
music by composers like Schu-
mann and Schubert.

According to Bouvier, the
Goethe lecture was successful. She M» ,
added that D.A.N.K. is involved Pour"
with other such cultural events that

will be coming up.

“We have dances, singing get-
together. and the Oktoberfest, of
course,” Bouvier explained, “but
we are very involved with the com-
ing celebration of the 300th anni-

_,versary of the first Germans.

Fundamental

gay menus: aoxmex

‘I-Il'avVe_ yoaev,er,noticed howa per-l ,

son (goes about eating his food?-If‘
you have, you've probably noticed
that every indivdual has a particu-
lar style of eating. I am going to
revise the adage, “You are what
you eat,” to ,“Y.ou are how you
eat.” ,

Naturally, style varies according
to the type offood being eaten, and
although no two styles are exactly
the same, a pattern emerges. ‘

Take soup, for instance. It is usu-

ally the first thing eaten in a meal.
The fact that soup is generally
served in a bowl gives rise to two
major types of soup eaters——the
,gu_lpers.and the sippers. Under the
gulping category, there are two
sub-categories—those who use
spoons and those who do not.

A gulper is a person who tries to
consume soup as fast as he can,
with or without a spoon. Those
who do not use spoons simply put
one hand on each side of the bowl,
position their lips on the edge of
the bowl and suck. This procedure
utilizes the same principle as a
vacuum. cleaner. A '

It is iiiteresting to note that the
gulpefs who do not use spoons
have come up with an ingenious
idea for when the quantity of soup
begins to diminish in the bowl.
They pick up the bowl with their
hands and then tilt the bowl
toward themselves in order to get
the last ounce of soup.

Tli6‘s’é gﬁlpéié who; for one 'rea- 1

son or another, do use spoons, offer
an almost comical style of eating.
Like the non—spooners, these peo-
ple try to eat soup as fast as they
can. The only difference is they use
a utensil to accomplish their goal.
The first thing a “spooner” does in
eating soup is to find the largest
spoon available, then he immerses
the spoon in his soup, fills the
spoon to the brim and quickly
shovels the spoon into his mouth
(inserting the entire “welled” por-
tion of the spoon).

When the spoon is pulled out of
the mouth, the whole process starts
over again. The fascinating aspect
of the spooner is the continuous
mechanical way in which he eats
soup. It is a precise, nonstop action
in which the elbowis the only part
of the body that moves. Like the
non—spooners, he tilts the bowl in
order to get the last of the soup, but
as usual, the spooners use a spoon.

  of

moves the spoon ‘away from him
across the top of the bowl, and
cocks his wrist at an 80—degree

angle, inserting onlylthe tip of the’

spoon into his mouth. Occasion-
ally, but not always, a sipper will

' tilt the bowl to scoop out the lastof

the soup. It should be noted that a
sipper will do this as inconspicu-
ously as possible
embarrassment.

The. next example of eating

styles deals with chicken. There are -

three main types in this category:
cave man, cannibal, and disector.
Cave man is a primitive form of
eating. It seems to be innate in
many people while in others it is
inherited. A cave man eater will
tear off the skin and meat of the
chicken with his teeth or fingers.
He pulls the meat off by latching
onto a loose flap of skin and then
pulling it along theentire length of
the chicken until it is totally torn
off. Then he bites into the meat,
tears it off into chunks and eats it.
Many times during this operation a
person’s mouth will come into

Contact with a bone: The person-

will either bite into the bone or try
to suck off the last morsels of meat.

The cannibal eater is the most
interesting of the three. He prefers
a particular part of the chicken.
Usually, he will ask for this part by
name, breast and leg being the
most popular. It is as if in his mind
he were replacing the chicken part
with a human part. Evidence seems
to suggest that a person’s favorite
chicken part corresponds to that of
his favorite human part.

The last type of chicken eater is
very highly advanced———the dissec-
tors. Dissectors use a knife and fork
to obtain their meat. The fork
strips off the skin, which is then
discarded, and knife is used to cut
precise amounts of meat along the

A anatomical lines of the chicken.

Once the meat has been cut, the
knife removes the remaining flesh
that is attached to. the bone and the
meat is then speared by the fork.

 

The second major type of soup
eater is the sipper. These people eat
their soup exclusively with a
spoon, however, they differ from
the spoon gulpers. The sippers use
a much smaller spoon than the
gulpers. They involve their elbows,
wrists, fingers, and neck while eat-
ing; they also go at a much slower
pace than the gulpers. A sipper
instinctively dips the spoon where
the soupline meets the bowl and
allows the soup to enter the welled
portion of the spoon. Then he

This style of eating can lead to frus-
tration if the knife is not sharp

. enough to cut the meat. Some-

times, a dissector can be seen fum-
bling with a fork and knife in order
to achieve his goal; but rarely does
he revert to the cave man style of
eating by using his hands to pull of
a piece of meat.

Another style of eating involves
pea. Much like the chicken eaters,
the pea eaters fall into three major
classes: the stickers, the rollers and
the sword swallowers. ’

 

to avoid.

_/« @3 "g

The suckers use the same, tech-
niques as the soup spoon gulpers.
The major difference is that the pea
suckers can use a fork as well as_a
spoon. Pea-sucking is not a true
form of sucking but rather a combi-
nation of sucking and biting. The
pea sucker will fill his fork or
spoon and then bring it to his
mouth. This is the point that
separates the suckers from the
rollers. Suckers will put the fork or
spoon partially in their mouths
then suck and scrape with their
teeth so that the peas go all the way
inside. A fork allows for biting
because of the prongs, while a
spoon gives way to sucking.

 

The next style of pea eaters is the
rollers. They also use the fork and

spoon in their respective style, but

they do not suck or bite. Instead,
they pile the peas onto the utensil,
lift it up to their mouth, tilt their
neck back slightly (along with the
fork or spoon) and allow the peas
to roll naturally into their mouth.

Now comes the rarest form of pea
eating. It is also the most bizarre
and dangerous of all the different
style of eating. I am of course talk-
ing about——pea sword—swallow-
ing.

This type of eating is the only
style which uses a knife as a means
of swallowing instead of cutting. A
pea sword-swallower will cau-
tiously place his knife near the peas

Fu

  

nctions

and then arrange them (with help
from his fingers) in single file.
Then lifts the knife to his mouth,
taking care to see that the knife is
parallel to the floor so as not to
spill any peas. Once the knife is in
position near the mouth, the neck
is tilted back as far as itcan go, then
the tip of the knife is set to rest on
the bottom ‘row of teeth. The knife
is then brought to a 25 degree angle
so that the peas may enter the
mouth. The knife blade must be
kept perfectly balanced at all times
so as not to cut the person’s mouth,
also to make sure that no peas drop
to the floor.

A warning must be given to any
person who attempts pea sword
swallowing. It is an extremely dan-
gerous style of eating that requires
steady nerves and a lot of practice.

Banana eaters around the world
recognize two categories of banana
eating the choppers and the break-
ers. A chopper peels off the skin of
the banana and then, by using a

knife, chops the banana into pie-4

ces. The width of the pieces ranges
in size from one—quarter to one-half
inch. The average banana has six
to twelve pieces, depending on the
size of the slices. After the banana
has been whittled down, a chopper
will use his fingers to put the pieces
into his mouth. It is a rare chopper

that uses a fork to place a piece into
his mouth.

A breaker, on the other hand,
uses his mouth to break the banana
into the desired portions. This is
accomplished by putting a banana
in one’s mouth so that the front
and back of the banana is touching
the teeth. Then by using the neck
in a “to and fro” motion, a piece is
broken off, chewed and swallowed.

Both the choppers and the break-
ers have a choice as to the type of
banana they are going to eat: hard,
semi-soft and mushy. The hard
banana can easily be identified by
the green color of the skin. There
may be difficulties in peeling off
the skin. Choppers should use an
extra sharp knife when trying to
cut a hard banana.

A semi-soft banana can be recog-
nized by the pure yellow color of
the skin. In the semi-soft condition
the skin is firm but supple; a condi-
tion ideal for both choppers and
breakers.

The mushy banana’s skin has
brown and black splotches over the
entire surface. The skin is very soft
and in advanced stages, it can be
torn by touch alone. However, in

the advanced stage, a banana can.

give off an unpleasant odor. Under
these circumstances, it should be
thrown away.

The Great Bed Race of 1982
will be remembered by many as
one of the least memorable
sporting events in their lives. It
had no switch hitters or hulky
running backs to carry the indi-
vidual teams. The one thing the
race did have was heart.

Throughout early A Sunday, ‘

morning, elimination races
were held for the participants
in the race. Each team’had to
construct its own bed and deco-
rate it as they saw fit;

Some of the teams took great
care in designing their beds and
choosing their attire. One team
dressed as hillbillies with straw
hats and overalls. Another, a
group of men, decided to go in
baseball uniforms and caps.
The team with the best
designed costumes was the
Medical ’ Center of Beaver
County, dressed as 
. Each team consisted of six
people; five to push the bed
around the track and one to
ride.

The track itself ran in front of
Hillman Library and looped
around the parking lot beside
Carnegie Museum, with the
start-finish line in front of the
steps of the library.

Though the main event of
the day was the bed race, there
were other activities to enter-
tain the crowd. The Pirate Par-
rot was there to display his
dancing skills; his specialty _is_
the robot style.” There was a
mime at his side helping him
choose children from the
audience with whom they
would dance.

An assortment of other peo-
ple dressed themselves in uni-
que ways. The main eye-catch-
ers were a man colored green, a
woman colored blue and
another woman who tried to
pass as a yet undiscovered fruit.

The elimination rounds took
their toll on the bed race partic-
ipants. There were a few wrecks
as the teams took the turns,
leaving some with scratches
and bruises. One team's bed lost
a wheel as it came upon the 3/4
post and, as a _result, had one of
the slower finishes of the day.

“I don’t feel too good about
what happened,” said team
captain Mike Jozwick. “The
back wheel just came .loose,
then busted.”

Despite the mishap, the team
finished the race.

“We finished the race, and
that’s what we set out to do,”
said jozwick. “We’ll be back

The purpose of the race is to

Most of'th'e teams were made up
of people who work in the
health related professions; doc-
tors, nurses and, of course,

paramedics.

The call for the final race
came. over the loudspeaker, and
the participants readied them-
selves. A few of the teams
brought pit crews; others made
their own adjustments. Wheels
were checked, cardboard was
replaced and muscles were lim-
bered. There were cheers from

‘ fans sitting in the bleachers as

 

the teams began to roll towards
the start line.

In order to prevent anymore
accidents, it was decided that

‘the starts would be staggered.

The clock would start as soon
as each team crossed the start
line, and the team with the best
time after completing two laps
would be declared the winner.

The teams stood at the start
line awaiting the gunshot. It
was famed E.T. who fired the
shot, and the race was off and
literally running. The theme
song from “Chariots of Fire”
played over the loudspeaker as
the teams ground their way past
the first turn;

There were more cheers from
the fans as Highland Veterans
Administration and Hyatt of

Pittsburgh passed the first lap

ollowed them by three bed
lengths. The pushers were
gasping for air as they made
their way_ around the turn.
Then at the 3/4 post, Hyatt
made its move, using the draft-
ing technique behind High-
land V.A. Then Hyatt pulled
past Highland in the stretch.
Now, it must be remembered
that each team started at a dif-
ferent time; but it was noticed
by all that Hyatt and Highland
started at almost the exact same
time—-in effect, they actually
were racing against each other.
Sensing this, the crowd roared
as they came down ‘the, stretch.

that they were the winners of

Larry O’Toole, who was one
of the winning team members,
said that it was a grueling race
but well worth the effort. .

“We had to keep pushing
ourselves toward the stretch

“but it was all for a good

Opinion

D

Tstill Searching
for the Dream

College students have apparently learned a new
equation by heart: marketable skill equalsfinancial
security, skiing vacations and 2.5 beautiful
children—in short, the “Great American Dream.”
Today’s undergraduate shops around for the most
promising major.

In the middle of our worst post—war recession, it is
obvious that career choice has become a function of

A the economy rather than preference._The current

generation of students rejects low pay and high
ideals in favor of a secure career whose median salary
_ is forever increasing. .

I A recent report compiled by the United States
Department of Education, comparing the majors
chosen/by 929,400 college seniors in 1979-80 with
those selected by 729,300 in 1969-70, indicates a defi-
nite shift. The number ofliberal arts majors isdim-
inishing, while engineering and business majors are
growing sharply.

0 Business and management majors accounted for
20 percent of total enrollments, up from 13 percent.

0 Computer and information sciences majors
increased from well under 1 percent to 1.2 percentof
the total. '

- 0 Education majors dropped from 21 percent to 13

I percent.

0 ‘The social sciences attractedionly 11 percent,
down from 20 percent. _

0 Foreign languages majors have declined from 3
percent of the total enrollment .to, less than 1.2
‘péiEé.iitL ; ,

0 Although technological progress is sparked by
those in physical sciences, the number of majors has
remained about the same—less than 3, percent.

The proponents of higher education have affec-
tionately held the View that a liberal arts education,
which offers a balance between the classics and the
sciences, best prepares. the individual to take his
place as an active member of society. We assume that
those who develop and help advance technology
understand the ethical _and social implications of
their actions. Sadly, we are sometimes mistaken.

Enviromental concerns and the overabundance of
malpractice suits are just a few glaring signs that
vocational education is incomplete. To ensure that
persons are being broadly educated, universities
need not take a Band-Aid approach. The problem is

“one that concerns all aspects of this nation’sifuture.
' One way to solve the problem before it starts is to

_ reform curriculum to ensure that even the profes-
sional tracks are dotted with at least a core of elemen-
tary liberal arts courses. I

Pitt is adopting such a plan to go into effect for
incoming freshmen next fall. The professional
schools at Pitt would do well to increase their pro-
portion of humanities courses as well. In fact, as the
rate of change increases faster than mankind’s
understanding of it, it will become necessary for
those in the professions to have a liberal arts
education.

Enforcing

By QHRISTINA CLINTON

» Allegheny County Commis-
sioner and U.S. Senate hopeful
Cyril Wecht told a Pittjournalism
class last winter that journalists
commonly practice a code of
silence to protect their peers from
the legal system and other outsiders
whoiwant to malign them.

He compared the jounalists’
“conspiracy of silence” to those of
the medical and legal professions. I
think Wecht’s assessment of the
media is true in a sense. I would go
to any lengths to protect a col-
league who was being hassled by
the public, or a private citizen.
Wecht called it a conspiracy, but it
is a much needed one in certain
professions.

A fellow reporter and myself ran
into our own “conspiracy of
silence” last week while we were
covering a story. It wasn’t in the
university administration, the
campus police or even in the stu-
dent government. It was in the
most unlikely place, the fraternity
system. A

The Pitt News wanted to report
on the brawl that took place at sev-
eral Bayard Street fraternities on
Sept. 11. We had heard rumors
about arrests and injuries and
decided, as journalists, we should
check it out.

So, using common sense, we
went straight to the source—the
fraternities involved. '

The fraternities were closed
mouthed about the whole incident
and, to top it off, were quite rude.

The part that confused me was
the reaction that was received from
the Interfraternity Council. A
reporter contacted Randy Bardol,
the IFC president, to see if we could
get the straight story as he’ knew it:
Bardol seemed quite perturbed that
The Pitt News had taken an inter-
est in the incident. After refusing to
comment, he threatened to go to

adviser and “talk” things over
Wltll him. Our adviser is an ex-
Greek from the University of Ten-
nessee and a former Greek adviser
at Pitt.

I don’t know if that meeting took
place, and if it did, I don’t know
what happened, but IFC main-
tained their “conspiracy of silence”
and I suspect, imposed iton at least
one of the fraternities involved.

Why does the Pitt fraternal sys-
tem need a conspiracy of silence?
Those clean—cut, All-American
boys have nothing to hide, do they?
After all, they always tell us how
they provide student leaders and
the future leaders of this country.

Fraternity presidents and ~lFC
officials are constantly coming to
the paper tovget some Greek func-
tion covered and we usually
comply. But when they are the sub-
ject of a story that does not show
them giving blood or racing in cha-
riots, they refuse to cooperate with
the press.

An IFC ad hoc committee was
formed to investigate what hap-
pened at the Bayard Street fraterni-
ties. I covered the meeting at which
the announcement of the‘forma-

_ tion of the committee was made.

Lou McLinden,. the Greek adviser,

was appointed to sit on this com- .

mittee. He said he came prepared to
discuss the incident, but when'Bar-
dol “surprised” him by giving him
an appointment, he decided to
shelve his speech for awhile. Ican
only wonder if Bardol decided to
make that move before or after he
saw me walk through the door at
the fraternity house where the
meeting was being held.

Why must IFC have a conspiracy I

of silence and impose .it on its

. members? They may all be doctors,

lawyers and oil company execu-
tives once they graduate, but what
are they now? What profession are
they protecting? None as far as I
can tell.

After the story ran in The Pitt
News last Friday, the president of
one of the quiet fraternities called
my editor and apologized for not

speaking with us. Did he call -

because the story . ran and he
decided he wanted his voice toebe
heard? Or did he call because that
great IFC executive board told him
it was okay? Your guess is as good
as mine.

Dear Editor:

In response to a letter appear-
ing in the Sept. 15 issue of The
Pitt News concerning unautho-
rized parties in the dorms, we
would like to voice the follow-
ing opinion.

The reason for havingparties
is- to bring people together for
the purpose of socializing-—
having fun. The fact that peo-
ple drink socially at a party does
not mean that everyone there is

‘It is conceded that .
parties can get rather
loud.’

an alcoholic, although such
people do exist. .Furthermore,
though alcohol tends to provide
a more relaxed atmosphere, it
does not necessarily have to
bring about an uncontrollable
situation. Similarly, the
absence of alcohol does not gua-
rantee that a party will not get
out of hand. Therefore, the real
issue is not whether or not par-
ties should be allowed in gen-

Parties Defended

eral, regardless of whether or
not alcohol is being served.

Before proceeding, we would
like to ask how the author
defines a party. Does a party
consist of 100 people? 50? 10? or
3? Should we all be arrested
each time we are caught in the
act of socializing? At present,
there is no exact definition for
what constitutes a party. There-
fore, two people in a two-man
room could be considered a
party.

It is conceded that parties can
get rather loud. However, it is
not the job of the campus police
to see that you receive a good
night’s beauty sleep. They can’t
haul people to the “drunk
tank” for playing their stereos
past midnight. If an individual
does not have the brains or the
guts to go and ask someone to
turn down a stereo, let it be his
own fault that he suffers a sleep-
less night.

So, the next time, Paul, you
are disturbed by a party and you
can find no one around to arrest
everyone involved, you might
try going to the party and join-
ing in on the fun.

Palestinian Carnage

Man’s Animal Traits Emerge  

By TED SCHWAB

Until today, I have relegated the
thought that man was an animal to
the back of my mind. The idea that

‘ man’s behavior at times could be

controlled by his animal instincts
had always been disconcerting.
The animal in the wild, stalking
his prey and slaughtering it,
seemed too grotesque; somehow I
cannot imagine that man was cap-
able of this. _

However, hearing and seeing
reports of the massacre of the
inhabitants of the Palestinian refu-
gee camp this weekend has made
me realize that man is capable of
much worse than this.

The sight of an hysterical
woman fleeing from the terror, car-
rying the maimed, lifeless body of
her daughter, the innocence that
once was—now a torn, gaping,
bleeding example of man’s deprav-
ity, has fundamentally changed my
understanding of man.

No longer can I conceive of man
as animal—-animals after all kill
only in order to feed and defend
themselves. Man, however, is capa-
ble of carriage in the pursuit of an
abstraction: nationalism. What

diverse, twisted thoughts allowed
the extremist phlangists to equate
the slaughter of the Palentinian
refugees with the national interests
of Lebanon?

much worse, something perverse.
From this point forward, I look to
the animals in the wild, not with
abhorrence, but in apreciation of
their innocence——an innocence of

I live on today reeling from this
weekend's carnage. The idea that I
once supressed as being too gros-
tesque, that man is subject to the
animal instincts of survival, now
seems like an idyllic vision. No
longer is man an animal. Man is

which man is incapable.

’Opponents of Student Aid on All

By DANA REED

The election of Ronald Reagan
brought us the largest peace-time’
military build-up in our nation's
history and the rhetoric of “getting
the government off the backs of the
people.” To achieve this, Ronald
Reagan began a vicious assault on
the standard of living of the Ameri-
can people by slashing social pro-
grams and federal regulations.

From cutbacks in student loans
to the elimination of affirmative
action and civil rights legislation,
the Reagan Administration has
rolled back decades of social and
economic progress. The billion-
dollar cuts from social programs to
pay for this military build-up have
fundamentally changed the role of
the government in our society,
leaving millions of poverty-
stricken and lower and middle class
Americans _ without.~adequate
‘income,’ health protection or the
opportunity to further their
education.

While tax cuts to corporations
will bear a large share of the
responsibilitylfor the tremendous
pressure on the budget and lead to
increased deficits, the planned
growth in military spending will
add almost as much to the federal
budget as the tax cuts will take
away. Under the facade of “budget
cuts,” Reagan has shifted billions
of dollars to corporations and the
Pentagon. The brunt of this build-
up will be paid for by working-
class Americans, while the
corporations make megabucks off
the Pentagon's new toys.

According to “The Coalition for
a New Foreign ‘and Military Pol-
icy,” some of the trade-offs this
military build-up entail are:

0 The $1.6 billion it costs to
build one “first-strike" Trident
nuclear submarine could rest()re
the $1.3 billion cut from the 1981
Mass Transit subsidies.

O The $400 million authorized
for development of the Pershing II
missile system could restore the
$352 million cut from health, edu-

cation and training programs.

0 The $40 billion for the 100 B-l
bombers would pay the cost of a
comprehensive 10-year energy-
efficiency effort to cut oil imports
by 20 to 35 percent.

Along with all these, we should
take into account the billions the
U.S. gives away -each year to sup-
port military dictatorships around
the world and pay for their military
adventures — from the $2 billion
we gave to Israel to invade and
occupy Lebanon to the $350 mil-
lion we gave to the fascist junta in
El Salvador for the mass murder of
their own people. These billions
could go to create jobs for the 11
million unemployed Americans
and increase access to higher edu-
cation for all Americans.

While the Reagan administra-
tion is mainly to blame for this
attack on the American people, we
must also focus our attention on
those in complicity ‘with them -
the Thornburgh administration of
Pennsylvania, the Pitt administra-
tion and the Board of Trustees.

Richard Thornburgh has con-
tinued to violate his campaign
promises by imposing financial
burdens on Pennsylvania students.
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, Pennsylvania
has the highest tuition for public
education in the country; Pitt is
one of the most expensive in the
country.

Also, according to the Common-
wealth Association of Students:

0 Tuition in Pennsylvania
increased 32 percent over the past
two years, more than 10 percent last
year at Pitt alone.

0 Tuition in’ Pennsylvania has
risen over 171 percent within the
past 10 years.

0 Pennsylvania ranked 50th in
increased funding from last year’s
fiscal budget to this year’s.fiscal
budget. We increased 5.5 percent
while the national median was 23
percent. The second lowest was 11

percent, double that of
Pennsylvania. -
O The Pennsylvania Higher

Education Assistance Agency was
cut an additional $2 million from
the govcrnor’s proposed budget.

0 Pennsylvania is the only state
whose public higher education
institutuions are. under the juris-
diction of the Department of Edu-
cation. This escalates tuition by
increasing red tape.

These figures show that Thorn-
burgh‘is no friend of higher educa-
tion.’ This, coupled with his
corporate tax give-aways and
“Workfare” programs, shows his
association and complicity with
the Reagan administration.
Thornburgh has defended “Reaga-
nomics” many times and has vehe-
mently supported his supply-side
nostrum.

Here at Pitt we also have our
own crew in cahoots with the
Reagan-Stockman team. Chancel-
lor Posvar and his corporate com-
panions on. the Board of Trustees
have done their best to make Pitt a
school for the elite.

They have brought us:

0 Outrageous tuition hikes, 12
in the past 13 years, making it more
difficult for working class and
minority students to attend Pitt.

0 Plans to close the geography
department. If they succeed in clos-
ing this department, which one
will be next? Black studies and
women's studies are prime targets.

0 The closing of the university
womens center. Given the green
light by the attacks on women by
the Reagan administration —— from
the defeat of the ERA, the attacks
on Title IX and affirmative action,
to the anti-abortion crusade of the
New Right—Posvar and the Board
of Trustees have followed along on
the national trend toward attacks
on women's rights.

While gloom surrounds higher
education, the Right continues its
anti-abortion crusade, and the
threat of war escalates with Rea-
gan’s Cold War rhetoric, ‘opposi-
tion seems almost non-existent at
I’itt. .

Student government is too busy
with homecoming floats and the
university is catering to its No. 1
football team.

But, there are some of us who
care and are organi\zing to voice
opposition to (‘lltl)1l('l(S' in student

Panthers Whip Past Florida State In Second Half

continued from page one

attempts at gaining any yardage,
Williams was able to duck under
the Panther rush to pick up nine
yards. Florida State head coach
Bobby Bowden played gambler,
went for the first down and suc-
ceeded when tailback Greg Allen
was able to spin away from the
swarming Panther defense to pick
up two yards and the first down at
midfield.

Williams went deep again on the
next play to Hester, but Panther
cornerback Tim Lewis was able to
intercept the ball at the Pitt 6.

Pitt ended up giving the ball
back after gaining two yards on
three plays. The Seminoles were
able to take the ball in for the first
score of the game.

By scon DELLETT

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.—-—It may
never rain in Southern California,
but don’t let anyone tell you it
never rains in Florida. The Sun-
shine State should have put its
head in the bench after what hap-
pened at Doak Campbell Stadium
in Tallahassee Saturday night.

It rained. Boy, did it rain.

The weather coming into West-
ern Florida was what anyone
would expect for the area in
Septem'ber—=hot and humid with
endless sunshine. The typical Flor-
ida weather continued through
Saturday morning.

Then the clouds came rolling in
from the Gulf Coast. There was
some precipation during the after-
noon, which lowered the tempera-
ture to a “bearable” 78 degree

instead of the customary 80-901

degree range.

The first half went well—-as far
as the weather was concerned—the
Pitt football team was outplayed

Foge Fazio

Tailback Ricky Williams ran for
nine yards after an incompletion
by Williams, then the senior quar-
terback hit Hester on two passes for
19 yards, bringing the ball to the
Pitt 8. On second and one, fullback
Ken Burnett took the hand-off on
the sprint draw by Williams and
bulled his way to the 3. One play
later, Allen took a pitchout to the
left and ran into the end zone. Phil
Hall’s kick was good, and the Sem-
inoles had a early lead.

Pitt was able to penetrate to the
12 on a Seminole face-mask
penalty and a short run by fullback
Marlon Mclntyre, but a loss of
eight yards by Thomas and a delay
of the back to the FSU 25. Marino
couldn’t find his primary receivers
on third down, and he went to
Thomas for a short gain.

1 during the first two quarters. After
the halftime show, where there was ‘

a firework display, the skies broke
open. Pittsburgh realized the storm
was coming—WTAE, who was tel-
evising the game, predicted the
rain 20 minutes ahead of time——but
Tallahassee didn’t, as the weather-
man said there was only a 20 per-
cent chance of rain.

Some 20 percent chance of the
wet stuff. The rain didn't start as
most do—a few little drops and
then the rainfall-~it was a cloud.

Of course it played havoc with
the game. Players were slipping all
over the grass field. Fumbles were
as commonplace as hidden bottles
in the stadium.

0 Fullback Marlon Mclntyre
fumbled a handoff at the 1-yard
line and quarterback Dan Marino
muffed the snap.

Punter Kelly Lowrey of Florida
State was back in punt formation at
the goal line. He dropped the snap
and rushed to kick the ball. The
ball hit his own blocker and went

A bit of luck was on the Panth-
ers’ side on the field goal attempt.
Schubert’s kick was low, but it hit
the crossbar and rolled over, get-
ting Pitt on the scoreboard with 36
seconds left in the quarter.

The Seminoles’ dominance in
the first quarter was shown in the
statistics: nine first downs to Pitt’s
one, 146 yards total offense to Pitt’s
23. Florida State held the Panther
ground game to -3 yards rushing in
the opening quarter, a figure usu-
ally seen on the Panthers’ side.

However, the running game
made a recovery of the Panthers’
opening drive in the second quar-
ter. Thomas opened the drive with
an 8-yard gain and McIntyre_
almost broke into the open, but
settled for a 23-yard gainto the FSU

straight up in the air. Panther def-
ensive end Art Lowery caught the
ball and was pushed into the end
zone.

“Mike (Brooks) and I were fight-
ing for the ball, “Lowery said.
“The ball came to me and I ran it
into the end zone. Ijust wanted to
get the ball and run it in.”

“I’ve scored before,” he added.
“but nothing like this.”

In total, there were five fumbles,
an interception and countless occa-
sions where players slipped on the
field.

If you think the players were the
only ones who had problems, think
again. The sidelines had at least
foot of water on the ground. The
statisticians gave out on taking de-
fensive tackles, since visibility up
at the press box was nearing zero
during the storm, and those people
who were around the uipper tiers
of Campbell Stadium had an extra
treat after the rain subsided, mil-
lions of moths surrounded the area
around the lights.

arlon Mclntyre_

Head coach Foge Fazio believes
the rain had a slight effect on the
outcome of the game.

“Of course the rainﬂiad a little
effect on the outcome,” Fazio said.

The rain has an effect on all
aspects of the game.

“The one ball they gave me felt
like five pounds,” punter Greg
Ganzer said.

“I kicked the ball once and my
foot stopped.”

J Ganzer said that the rain had lit-
tle effect on Fazio’s decision to
punting the ball on third down.

“The rain didn’t really have an
effect on the decision,” Ganzer
said. V

“We did the same thing last year
when we were trapped deep in our
end.”

Dan Marino said that Pitt only
threw when they had to, while
Julius Dawkins said he couldn't
run because his shoes and socks
were wet.

Offensive guard Ron Sams
scoffed at the idea that'the offensive
line had an advantage, once the
downpour came.

“We had no problems with their 1

line,” Sams said. “They had no
quickness, and everything they did
we were prepared for.”

“I feel the rain didn’t matter,” he
continued. “It was raining on both
teams.” I

The feeling about the rainstorm
was mixed, depending on‘ what
side the person was on.

One Florida State fan, wearing
garnet and gold, said with bitter-
ness dripping in his voice as he was
walking down the ramp, “We
would have won if the rain never
came.”

Sam simply said in the true tradi_-
tion of offensive lineman, “We
enjoyed it out there.”

To respond to the red-necked
Seminole fan: You would have
won in Southern California.

Fazio is Still The President  

By BARRY ZASLOFF

A former sociology professor of
mine recently approached me with
a new reason why Pitt will not win
this year’s national championship.
He explained that Foge Fazio is
running a “democracy,” with “ev-
eryone having a hand in the pie.”
Dan Marino IS the president. Fazio
is the vice-president.

“Marino is bigger than Fazio,"
he said, pointing to a copy of
Sports Illustrated that had Mari-
no’s picture strewn across the front
cover. “Fazio comes across as a nice
guy, but not the kind of coach who
can guide a team to a national
championship.”

To be No. 1, he reasoned, Pitt
needs an authoritarian coach like
Woody Hayes yor Frank Kush.
Maybe even Jackie Sherrill or Joe
Paterno would do.

At first, the suggestion sounded
reasonable. At press conferences
and in the paper, Fazio comes
across as humorous and easy
going—not the type to crack the
whip when necessary. Simply put,
Fazio often gives the impression
that he doesn’t take his job
seriously.

Under closer scrutiny however,
there are as many holes in the pro-
fessor’s theory as there are in a
sieve.

   

Is Fazio just an easy going pussy
cat? If so, he put on a great Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde imitation at
halftime of last year’s Sugar Bowl,
giving a lecture that would have
done even the legendary Hayes
proud.

Viewpoint

He was a tiger. Better yet, a_

crabby drill sargeant. Tightened
Jaw, face beet-red and words tough

enough to send shivers through an

innocent television viewer.

Humorous? Easy going? His
eyes were stormy enough to make
Jackie Sherrill’s_appear like a calm
wave. _

And the defense gave asmuch
respect as any Arizona State player
could have ever given Frank,Kush,
as demonstrated by the way they
stuffed Herschel Walker and the
Georgia Bulldogs in the second
half. ~

The same thing happened inlast
Saturday’s game against Florida
State. As the game began, the wind
was howling and the lightning
flashing. Combine that with the
Seminoles’ jump toa 10-0 lead, and
there was a feeling that the stadium
was haunted by ghosts of years
past.

Two years past to be exact, when
the Seminoles crushed the Pan-
thers’ chance at a national cham-
pionship by blowing Pitt out of
Tallahassee. When Florida State
grabbed the 10-point lead, all con-
cerned were no doubt fearing the
worst. Seminole runners were
streaking by Panther defenders fas-
ter than lightning. The wind
seemed calm compared to the
option game that the Seminoles
were hurling at Pitt. .

But the Panthers tied the game
by halftime. Then the monsoon
hit; perhaps Mother Nature crying
at what Fazio was shouting to his
players in the locker room.

As in the last year's Sugar Bowl,
Pitt came out storming on its way
to a 37-17 win. The defense
enclosed the option and shut down
the aerial attack. The offense
moved downfield almost as fast as
the rain fell from the sky.

Once again, the Panthers came
from behind to defeat a tough
opponent—a sure sign of a well-
coached team. They put behind
thoughts of the wind and rain and
perhaps a few ghosts, and proved
themselves worthy challengers for
the national championship.

And as Serafino Fazio victor-
iously crossed the field, the smile
on his face behind the storm told
the story.

Ca tlett Jealous Of Panthers

By DALE MOORE

Last week all eyes and ears were
on Morgantown, W.Va., home of
the West Virginia Mountaineers.
The media attention was prompted
by the fact that the Mountaineer
football squad, coached by Don
Nehlen, had pulled off» the first
major upset of the football season.
West Virginia literally flew past
the Oklahoma Sooners, 41-27.

With all of the media looking for
a new angle on this David and

Goliath football game, a reporter

must have bumped into the Moun-
taineer basketball coach Gale
Catlett and proceeded to get per-
haps the most interesting story of
the week from Morgantown.
Before this article goes any further,

some background material is

needed.

For those with short memories,
Catletthas an uncanny knack of
talking when he should be listen-
ing.‘ Just last season he com-
mented. after defeating Pitt 82-77,

that the Panthers were no better
than a mediocre basketball team.
The Panthers came back and beat
the nationally-ranked Mountain-
eers in the finals of the Eastern 8
tournament. Not bad for a medio-
cre team.

This is a new year though, and
Pitt is no longer in a league with
WVU. Pitt moved out of the Atlan-
tic 10, previouslythe Eastern 8, and
up to the Big East. This move has
made Catlett angry.

It seems that Catlett feels Pitt
betrayed the other members of the
league when the Panthers made
theirmove for the big time. Catlett
said that the Atlantic 10 would
have been a total sports conference
if the Panthers had remained a
member. Because of Pitt’s depar-
ture, the league is having a tough
time signing a television contract
to bring in the revenue needed to
run a first-class operation.

’ Why would Pitt do such a thing
as change leagues? Whether he
believes it or not, it wasn’t to aggra-
vate Catlett. Pitt wants to develop
into a national basketball power.

This may take some time, but there
is no better place to begin than in
the Big East. The competition _is
perhaps the best in the nation. The
Big East had two of the final four
teams in the NCAA‘ tournament
last year——Georgetown and Boston
College. just facing this type of
competition on a regular basis
makes a team improve.

Pitt will also get something that
every aspiring athletic program
needs—exposure. The Big East has
a television contract that includes
cable and network stations.

This is related-to the second rea-
son for switching to the Big East:
money. Part of the moneyfrom the
television contracts is divided
among the member schools. It
takes money to build and sustain a
winning program; television
revenues can provide a pretty good
chunk of change.

At the core of the issue is Catlett’s
jealousy. He, and for that matter
any other coach in the Atlantic 10,
would jump into the Big East if
given the chance. Losing to Villan-
ova on television does more for the
future of your team than beating a
dozen teams the caliber of Morgan
State. You have a nice record, but
no money, no exposure and most of
all no competition.

WVU had one of the best records
entering the NCAA tournament
last year, but lost in the second
round, perhaps because they didn’t
face sturdy competition during the
regular season. They won’t become
competitive until they stop sched-
uling the little schools and move:
up. Just like Pitt has, Gale.

Springdale Stars
Lead St. Vincent

Over Panthers

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The pattern is rather simple:
Play four years of varsity soccer at
Springdale High School, then
pack the luggage and head toward
St. Vincent College, where John
Granish will have his arms opened
wide.

Granish, the soccer coach at St.
Vincent for the past five years, has
turned Springdale—where he
attended high school—into St.
Vincent's top farm team.

Or so it seemed last Wednesday
night, as the St. Vincent soccer
team defeated Pitt, 2-0. On a field
generally reserved for football
passes rather than soccer kicks,
Springdale held a reunion of sorts.

Six former Springdale players,
now members of the St. Vincent
team, held the ceremony at Pitt Sta-
dium. For good measure, they even
invited Torn Trempus, an ex-
teammate who defied the majority
by choosing Pitt over St. Vincent.

Senior co-captains Kirk Dren-
non, a goalkeeper, and Bob Page, a
sweeper-back, juniors Dave Mink,
a defensive back, Len Vincler, a
midfielder and Jeff Sheldon, a

striker, and freshman Dean
Zanella, also a striker, are among
the many Springdale graduates
who have travelled to Granish’s
pasture.

“I took over a team with an 0-14
record, and turned to the people
back home for help,” Granish said

shortly after the game. “They were

very receptive, so I continue to go
back.“

It doesn’t hurt that Granish
speaks regularly with Springdale
coach Richard Stolar. The two
were teammates on Springdale’s
1966 WPIAL championship team.

St. Vincent’s players were also
well acquainted, especially those
from Springdale. They displayed
the kind of cohesiveness that
results from years of playing
together. '

Drennon played in goal as if he
knew every move that Mink would
make before he made it. Vincler
knew precisely when Sheldon——the
team’s leading goal scorer for the
past two years—would make his
move for the net.

“It’s easy to coach a team like
that,” Granish said. “It’s just a
matter of whether the athletes can
hang onto what they learned in

1 34. Marino hit Thomas on a screen

for five, hit tight end john Brown
with a pass he couldn’t handle and
a Mcliityre four yard carry set up a
fourtli-and-inches situation at the
25.

Deciding not’ to face another
field goal hitting the crossdbar,
coach Foge Fazio went for the first

 down and was saved from the crit-

ics when Mclrityre drove for 2
yards.

A Thomas run for 6, a pass to
Mclntyre for 10 and a run by McIn-
tyre for 4 put the ball on the Semi-
nole 3-yard line. After the officals
ruled that Collins’ feet were not
inbound when he caiighta lob pass
from Marino in the corner of the
end zone, McIntyre went through
the left side for a touchdown at the
10:27 mark of the second quarter.
Schubert’s kick tied the game at 10.

The Seminoles were unable to
move the ball, and reserve tailback
Joe McCall was a factor in the next
Panther scoring drive. The one-
time starter gained 22 yards on two
carries. This, added to a comple-
tion to Dawkins for 15 and a per-
sonal foul for a late hit after a
McCall catch for two, brought the
ball to the FSU four, where McIn-

tyre scored his second touchdown
of the game. The extra point by
Schubert made it 17-10 with 6:49
remaining in the first half.
Bowden went farther into his
bag of tricks, pulling out
quarterback—punter Kelly Lowrey.
The Seminoles went into an option
offense which caught the_ Panther
defense off guard. The big play was

a Lowrey pitch to Ricky Williams,

which brought theball from the
Florida State 38 to t.he «Pitt 32.
Three plays later, on fourth and
nine, Bowden again went for the
first down as Lowrey hit wide
receiver Dennis McKinnon with a
pass for 16 yards and a firstdown at
the 15.

Ricky Williams ran four of the
next five plays, the fifth carry a
touchdown from one yard out.
Hall’s kick tied the game up.

The rain started to come down at
the beginning of the second half, as
Pitt mounted a drive off the open-
ing kickoff. A combinatioin of
runs by Thomas and Mclntyre
brought the ball to the Florida
State one.

The soggy ball had an effect on
the drive. On first and goal at the
one, McIntyre fumbled the handoff
and Marino had todive on the ball
at the six on the next play, Marino

fumbled the snap and recovered it
for a loss of one. On third down, a
Marino pass was intercepted by
safety Larry Harris after teammate
Harvey Clayton deflected the ball.

After a 6-yard gain by Williams,
Florida State proceeded to go back-
wards as Williams lost two and
Lowrey was sacked for a loss to the
Seminole 15.

Lowrey fumbled the snap from
center and, in his rush, hit his own
blocker in the back. Defensive end
Art Lowery waited for the ball to
come down ‘into his hands and
returned the ball five yards for the
touchdown. Scliubert’s conversion
made it 24-17 at the 6:06 mark of the
third quarter.

The Seminoles were not ready’ to
give up. Lowrey was still baffling
the Panther defense with his moves
on the option, running for 8 yards
and pitching out to Allen for 20
more. Florida State was ab‘: to get
to the Pitt 13, but the Panther
defense was able to stiffen Lip and
Troy Hill intercepted at option
pass from running bac Cedric
Jones at the 10. ,

Pitt only moved the ;-all four
yards on two plays, so on third
down Fazio called on Greg Ganzer
to punt the ball. Ganzer got it out
to the 50 with no return.

The Panther defense held Flor-
ida State's offense and got the ball
back 0 their own 23. Runs by Tho-
mas of 19 and 15 yards along with a
15-yard penalty on the Seminoles
and the critical third and five com-
pletion to tight ends john Brown
at midfield set up a Marino toss to
wide receiver Julius Dawkins 16-
yard touchdown pass. The catch
was the first touchdown of the yer
for Dawkins, who had 16 in 1981.
Schubert hook the ball wide left of
the goal post, and Pitt had a com-
fortable 30-l7 lead.

Bowden continued to pull out
the gadget plays. A reverse by
McKinnon gained 26 yards, but on
the next play, Allen fumbled the
ball and defensive tackle Bill Maas
recovered. On the next series of
downs, Lowery tried a pass from
punt formation at the FSU 17 but
the ball fell harmlessly to the
ground.

Five plays later, Marino hit
Brown for the 3-yard touchdown
pass that locked the game up for
the Panthers.

After an inauspicious start, the
Panther football team appears to
be on_ the right road to contending
for the national championship.
The sometimes rainy trip_to Talla-
hasse was indeed a rewarding one.

"Pitt Blows Seminoles Away In Second Half

GAME NOTES-

—Despite the
horrid start, the Pitt running attack
performed very well, particularly
in the second half. The Panthers
carried the ball 45 times for 176
yards, with Thomas gaining 95
yards on 24 carries and McIntyre 61
on 16... Thomas was again the
Panthers’ leading receiver with
four catches for’39 yards... Ganzer
had‘ a 50.5 yard average on two
punts in the first half, but with the
rainy his average decreased to 43.3..
Lowrey, thanks to his straight up
punt, averaged only 19.3 yards on
four kicks. His longest was 32
yards. Ironically, Lowrey was 15th
in the nation in punting before Sat-
urday night’s game withia 43.5 yard
average on four punt...Ganzer was
11th before Saturday night...For
the second game in a row, Marino
was under 200 yards passing. He
was 13-22 for. 133 yards and one
interception... Florida State‘ out-
gained Pitt in total yardage 357 to
309 despite the 20-point mar-
gin...The Seminoles gained 237
yards on the ground. The attend-
ance Saturday night broke the all-
time Doak Campbell Stadium
record of 53,772 set in 1980.

Field Hockey Team Impressive DespiteA Loss 

By MELODY BISH

The Lady Panther field hockey
team took on highly-regarded
Bucknell in a hard—fought match
Thursday afternoon. It was the first
test for a young team and their
second—year coach, Cindy Bald-
ridge, and it was a test which they 
passed admirably. A I

Although the final outcome was
2-0 in favor of-Bucknell, the Pan-
thers played well.

Bucknell scored fifteen minutes
into the first half on a penalty
stroke and closed out the scoring
with seven minutes left in the half.

Considering that it was the first
game of the season, Baldridge was
pleased with the team’s play, par-
ticularly the defense. She praised
Terri Zygarowicz, Jessica Blake,
Deb Medara and Joanne Patterson
for their efforts.

“Defensive1y," said Baldridge,
“we took the play away from them,

play.” Baldridge also praised the
play‘ of Bucknell, saying that they
displayed good stick work and
played very aggressively. To sum
the game up, Baldridge said, “We
had some breaks,_ but we just
couldn’t capitalize on them.”
Only a couple of players were
lost to graduation last year so there
is a lot of potential fora great sea-
son. The team’s next match is on
Tuesday against Kent State. If they
continue to improve at their (:ur—
rent pace, the Panthers will accum-
ulate many wins.

, Zanella, an All-WPIAL and All-

a high school senior last year, has
adapted remarkably fast. He scored
the second St. Vincent goal.

“I don't feel like a freshman,” he

said. “I’ve_,bge,nplayirig with some

thwarted every Panther scoring
chance.

“The togetherness helps,” Dren-
non nodded, adding, “I came to St.
Vincent because many of my
former teammates were here. They
sold the program to me.”

Trempus, now a senior captain

for the Panthers, wasn’t in the‘

market to buy what St. Vincent had
to sell.

“Their coach sent me transfer
forms for three straight years,”
Trempus said. “They just didn’t
have an established program at the
time.”

They_ do now, though, having
finished last year with a 10-3-l
record. Much of the turnabout can
be attributed to a passageway run-
ning from Springdale to St.
Vincent. A .

“I WOULDN'T
TREAT
MY BIKE

THE WAY YOU
TREAT

YOUR BODY”

-Judy Lafferty

When Judy Laf-
ferty prepares for a
race like the annual
cross-Iowa run, she
makes sure her bike is
in perfect shape.

She inspects and
adiusts every part. She
tunes and balances
the whole machine, so
it can go the distance.

2 Because she
treats her body the
same way, she discov-
ered a lump in her
breast a few years
ago.

She discovered it
early. And these days,
85°/o of early breast
cancers can be treated
successfully.

Judy has since
had reconstructive
sur er , too. And she
fee 5 li e herself
again. Alive, vibrant,
ready to get on her-
bike and take on the
world.

Judy Lafferty is
iust one example of
the kind of progress
we're making against
cancer in its many
forms. I
