absence of the chief justice.
 The formation of a minor ju-

- due'to the delay in selecting the‘
seven justices.

Although the senate has the
responsibility of working on the
plan for such a system, it has
hesitated because of a motion
passed by the Student Affairs
Committee. The motion stipu-
lates that justices-elect work out
a plan for minor judiciary sys-
tem before they can act as a

Dr. Prokof ’Yev stressed the
importance in the Russian sys-

“We have a wide network of
adult schools attached to "all big

reflects the standards. of excell-
ence for which the University is
striving. I. am well acquainted
with several of the Woodrow Wil-

joined in the praise of the win-
ners by saying, “I am" equally

THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY SIGAFOOS

It was a. dullish evening at the Tlieta house. The pledges were i
down in the catacombs; the actives were sacked out upstairs.
not doing much of anything. Mary Ellen Krumbald was stick-
ing pins in an effigy of the houscmother; Evelyn Zinsmaster
was welding a manhole cover to her charm bracelet; Algelica.
McKeesport was writing a letter to Fabian in blood. Like I say,
it was a dullish evening.

Suddenly Dolores Vladnay stood up and stamped her foot.
.“Chaps,” she said to her sorors, “this is too.yawn—rnaking! Let’s
do something gay and mad and gasp-making. Anybody got an
idea?” - I . ‘

“N 0,” said the sorors, shaking their little sausage curls.

“Think, chaps, think!” said Dolores and passed Marlboro
cigarettes to everybody, for if there ever -was a smoke to start
you thinking, it is mild and flavorful Marlboro! Things come
clear when you puff that good, clean smoke through that ﬁne
ﬁlter—knots untie, dilemmas dissolve, problems evaporate,

- cobwebs vanish, fog disperses, and -the benevolent sun pours ’
radiance on a new and dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh,
,Marlboro! Oh, soft pack! Oh, ﬂip-top box! Oh,. get some
already!

        

   ..._   fr
‘.‘ ‘I ha law 3755 .7/a’! weal

Now Geraldine Quidnunc, her drooping brain cells reviviﬁed
by a good Marlboro, leapt up and cried, “Oh, I have 9. perfect
gasser of an idea! Let’s hypnotize somebody!” .

“Oh, capital!” cried the sorors. “Oh, tingle-making!"

At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alice Blue-
gown. “Excuse me, mistresses,” said she, tugging her forelock, '
“I have ﬁnished making your beds, doing your homework, and
ironing your pleats. Will there be anything else?”

“Yes,” snapped Dolores Vladnay. “When I count to three,
you will be hypnotized.”

.“Yes, exce1lency,” said Alice, bobbing a curtsey.

.“One, two, three,” said Dolores.

Alice promptly went into a trance. _

,“Go back,” said Dolores, “back into your childhood. Go
back to your ﬁfth birthday, back to your birth, to before your
birth, to your last incarnation . . . Now, who are you?’.’.

“My name is Bridey Sigafoos,” said Alice. “The year is 1818,
and I am in County Cork.”

.“Coo!” said the sorors. .

.‘_‘How old are you?” asked Dolores. .. '

.“I am seven,” said Alice.

.“Where is your mother?” asked Dolores. ~

“I don’t know,” said Alice. “She got sold at the fair last
year.”

.“Coo I” said the sorors. .

.‘‘Tell us about yourself,” said Dolores. -

“I am ﬁve feet tall,” said Alice. “Ihave brown eyes, and I
weigh 3200 pounds." ‘

.“Coo!" said the sorors.

.“Isn't that rather heavy for a girl?" said Dolores.

f.‘Who’s a girl?” said Alice. “I'm a black and white guernsey.”

!‘Coo 1’ ’ said the sorors.

(‘Moo !” said Bridey Sigafoos.

-Boasting to Community *

The recent announcement of the university’s plans to
erect a $13 million dormitory within the next two years no
doubt will prompt the usual pro and con discussion.

The discussion against the newest section of the expan-
sion program, as always, will come from several segments

. of the Pittsburgh community.

The tax-paying public which remembers when the Ca-
thedral of_ Learning was built complains that too much tax-
able land is being eaten up by theuniversity. This group
also gripes because Pitt no longer cares about the street-
car students. ' _ .

The Oakland businessmen comprise another segment,
The university’s expansion is bad for the business dollar,
they say. Further, they ask, why should Pitt “run” things in
Oakland? '

Looking at the expansion. program from these narrow
points of view, perhaps we, too, would question the validity
of the university’s ‘ideas for the future. But the points of
view are all too narrow and mostly invalid themselves. V.

True, the $13 million dormitory will bring the total
possible number of resident students to approximately
3,600. This ﬁgure could indicate that more than half the
Pitt student body will be from locationsother than Pitts-
burgh.

V This remains to be seen, however. With such programs
as the trimester system and increased facilities, the uni-
versity will be capable of holding a greater number of stu-
dents than it presently has. i ,

' The opponents of an increased out-of—town enroll-

ment must realize another fact. No great university main-
tains its classrooms for local students alone. A student’s ed-
ucation can be broadened not only by the courses he takes,
but by the people with whom he comes in contact,
‘ As far as the businessmen are concerned, they should
stop and think about the present Oakland and the future
Oakland. Anyone who walks on Forbes Avenue between
the university and, say, Atwood Street, knows that this
stretch is not the most pleasant or desirable.

Who will miss the bars and the'back—room and-second-

‘ﬂoor hangouts. Only the undesirable characters who haunt ,

them now. _

The standards of the Oakland community surely will
rise when the university expansion is completed. The qual-
ity of property no doubt will be improved. The quality of
the students and the education should be improved.

No one can ask for much more than that.

.let It Snow

It snowed last Thursday and the university’s adminis-
trators panicked. N o 8 or 9 o’clocks Friday, they graciously
‘announced. ‘

They might as well have cancelled classes for the en-
tire day considering the greatly reduced number of students
who bothered coming to‘ school at all. V

vMany students felt as long as they didn’t have to come
to school for their ﬁrst two classes, they shouldn’t come for
the other one or two they "might have had.’ Others felt that
if the powers-who-be could call off two ‘classes, they could

take it upon themselves personally to cancel their other’

classes. _

Attendance in many classes was poor and in some cases,
teachers stayed home. All it amounted to, as far as classes
were concerned, was a wasted day. With the speed at which
everything around here. seems to travel, we cannot afford
wasted days. ' ,

Many complaints arose last trimester because of-the

. number of days wasted for football rallies and other events.

We can afford to have classes cancelled, but we don’t have.
time to hold a decent and sane ﬁnals week.

May we suggest to the person or persons who cancelled

the ﬁrst two classes last Friday that the next time it snows,

' calmly grab your shovel and clear the walks. The classes

will take care of themselves.

Writer Sees ‘Red’ . . .

Vacation .With Pay

By Murray Chess

The topic of athletic scholarships always is
good for a few paragraphs of discussion. In these
next few paragraphs we do not wish to talk about
this form of remuneration in general. Only two
aspects of the scholarships will suffice at this’ time.

These aspects are, scholarships given to red-
shirts and those handed out to
non-playing athletes. V

For those uneducated in the EV
lore of athletics, red-shirting 3-
may be explained more lucidly,
in brief, as the five—year plan
for athletes. These ﬁve-year,
sports’ lovers are found mostly
in football, but make their way 
into several other sports as well.

Players usually are red-
shirted in their second year in
school. Thus, they sit out a year
between freshman and varsity competition. This
is done at the coach’s bidding, notlthe players —
mainly because the team just has too many players.
at that position in that particular year.

So the sophomore — he-’ll have that status for
two years, unlike ordinary students —- sits out a
year and becomes a more mature competitor.
Financial Liabilities

Even though they are not bringing glory to
“dear old Pittsburgh,” they nevertheless receive

‘ their salary. It’s something like vacation with pay.

Even" the argument that athletes, through their
services, bring great wealth to the uniV.ersity’s
treasury cannot be used here for the simple reason
that red-shirts are liabilities on the ﬁnancial state-
ment. Assets-they may be in succeeding years, but
in that sit-it-out year, only liabilities.

Now .it’s really not just the fact that the boy. .

gets his scholarship for doing next to nothing (let
us not forget that these boys could not have come
to college without these scholarships).

It’s also the whole idea of red-shirting that

does not lie well with us. Most college coaches will '

agree, we hope,‘that the motive of attending col-

_ lege is to receive an education that "Will help "one

in .one’s future years. - --

Being realistic.about it, however, some boys’
attend college just to be an athlete. There is
nothing wrong with going to school for: ﬁve years. V

Accompanist Gerald Moore . . .

Teaches Listening

By John Lowenfllal

Gerald Moore, the English pianist who spe-
cializes in accompanying world-famous singers and
string players, and who probably does it better
than anybody else, is -also a ﬁrst-rate teacher.

He presented a program last Wednesday at
Midday Series entitled “The V
Unashamed Accompanist” which,
although most entertaining, was
quite topical. The fact that most E
everybody '\in the audience. en- ;
joyed. the show is evidence of E;
Mr. Moore’s exceptional ability 
to enliven a subject and put it I

He is evidently an extraor-
dinarily enthusiastic music-lover, -
a bit of a rarity among the real
pros, sad to say." He brought to I
Midday and to the three o’clock coffee hour his

 

great wit and charm to bear on communicating to -

his audience an appreciation of the music and its
problems. The position of the accompanist was
only a point of view.
Clever Speaker. Good Player

He used as his method the lecture—demonstra-
tion, sparked by humor and some ﬁrst-class piano
playing. He would talk on a subject and then use

I his piano to illustrate it. Playing only the accom-

paniment to several Schubert lieder (songs), he
emphasized to the audience that these piano parts
were essential to the understanding of the song,
and often just as interesting as the vocal line.

When he played the galloping lines of the song, '

“The Er1—King,” nobody needed to hear ‘a singer
to visualize the terror and tragedy of this piece.
In the afternoon he played the piano part of "a
Schubert song in ﬁve “identical” verses, showing
how the pianist needed to think and phrase each
verse according to the words of the song. '
Five Notes in Two Ways

To illustrate the problems of accompanying, Mr.
Moore played a simple ﬁve-note introduction to a
song and explained that it is the pianist’s respon-

~s__ibi._l1ty"to-- set the mood‘ of ythesong 111 .these- ﬁve ‘

 

‘athletic scholarships in general.

'even do that much, let. him pay his own,way. i

But, if the reason for the extended education is
to play in some sport, why not institute a degree
in that subject? Then, if they want tomake a
ﬁve-year course required, we wouldn’t gripe.
Three-Year Free Ride

Actually, the non-playing athlete is not too far
distant from the red-shirted athlete. There is one
major difference, however. The non-playing ath-
lete sometimes takes it easy for three years rather
than just» one. o

By the non-playing athlete we mean one
who is retained on the squad to ﬁll out the roster
or to be around incase all the other players
ahead of him suffer injuries-

Even though he sits on the bench and perhaps
helps the team only in practice, he’ receives his
scholarship for the four years.

, A point that bothers us about. this chap, and
the red-shirt too, is this,“ When a "student is
granted an academic scholarship, he receives the
aid as long as he attends classes. If he doesn’t
go to school, he doesn’t, receive the money. I't’sas
uncomplicated as that. ' "

_ Now take the athlete. He receives his scholar; 4”
ship not to go to school, but to play. So if he

doesn’t play — in the case of our non-playing
athlete or our red-shirt— why should he get paid?
Double-Trouble - A

Worse than either of our two fellows described

‘above is the boy who acts both roles during his

playing days — the boy who is red-shirted when
he is a sophomore and who then adopts the status
of a non-playing athlete -for the next three years.

This scholarship enemy number one attends

the university for ﬁve years, rarely does anythinggg

to further the name of athletics at the university
and gets paid for it. 4 . —
As we said at the outset, we aren’t attacking
Give the poor
guys" a means by which they can Home to college
rather than make them go to work in’ the mill.
-But let the athlete’ earn his scholarship. If’he’s
not good enough to ‘play in his sophomore year —
if he._,has to be red-shirted —’ withhold his aid
until. he attains‘ the status of a needed player."
If he’s not good enough to play in that he.just
sits onthe bench year after" year, or maybe doesn’t

After all, the “C” student paysyhis own way.

W '+h H   T  
‘ First he played them just as written, without
feeling or interpretation and showed that such a

Playing did nothing to create a mood. Then he-::;~'<r

played them with the right feeling. The difference
was obvious, dramatic -and artfully projected.
When ‘Mr. Moore wished to show that music
making was a diplomatic partnership arrangement,
_he told. little anecdotes’ of working with performers.
For instance, he told of a time when the introduc-
tion, to a , song ' consisted of a single chord:
BONG-G! A
A Ouiclrﬂong-g . =
. He played the chord and the singer looked at him
queerly. She asked him to play  again. “De-

lighted,” he said. BONG-G! Still she was not satis- ,

ﬁed. So, again BONG-G! She thought for a while
and ﬁnally said, “Ah, I know what is wrong. You
are playing the chord too fast.” ‘
Now in these short hours Mr. Moore really got
across quite a bit of abstruse material. He dis-
cussed the total impression‘ of an art -song, the
problems of playing .an accompaniment, music as a
partnership affair, and many other similar subjects.
He undoubtedly increased the appreciation for
music of most people who heard him. P
But he did not patronize his audience. He rea-
lized that respect and humor and theatrical sense
are essential qualities of the most effective teacher.
And he was a most effective teacher.

The Russians were avidly interested in all phases
-of college and university activities. On this occa-
sion they met with leaders of Pittsburgh col-
leges and universities. I ’

When questioned about extra-

a list which included‘ ballet,-.
sports, theater, music literary
societies, lectures, scientiﬁc so-
cieties, student newspapers, and
many others. “If we were to
list all of them, it would take

said.

The delegation came to Pitts-

Although they had planned to
visit Cornell, they were forced to
come straight to Pittsburgh be-

_ cause of the severe snowstorm.

Thus, Pitt was the first Amer-
ican college that the team actu-
ally visited, aside from a brief
stop at the University of Mary-

tion stayed at Bruce Hall.

‘End of Cheater

,St_udent Concern, Action

Only Method for Cure

“Cheating is a student problem
which can only be solved by stu-
dent concern and action,” declared
Woody Turner in a personal inter-
view Iast Monday. -
After ,conducting' an informal
two-month investigation of cheat-
ing in the university, Turner
stressed the need for some sort of
control. “The real meat of the
problem‘ is that everyone knows
about it, but no one is acting on
it,” he said.
'In order to alleviate this pro-
blem, Woody is in the process of
forming a committee to study the
. problem and eventually make re-,
commendations -for its control.
Composed of student leaders, the

_ committee will act as a “top level
advisory group.”

Its first purpose will be to
discover the extent of cheating
in the university and to investi-
gate lax examination proce-
dures, permitting such a prac-
tice.

' From student and faculty inter-
views, the committee will compile
actual case studies. Results of the
investigations will be made public
in a full committee report some-
time in April.

at the university, he acquired a
kidney ailment which doctors told
him would be fatal. Thus, he
abruptly left for his homeland.

Nothing more was heard from
him until recently, when Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld received a letter

Fikret remembered that during
his illness, the Dean of the School
of "Engineering, E. A. Holbrook
wrote his father that “you-should
be proud of your son. He came to‘
Pitt as a stranger and soon prov-

Year’s

  1.1-.14 Record Better

The Panther hoopsters started the basketball season with
a 73-57 win over Michigan and ended it Saturday night with
a 73-66 loss to Kentucky at Lexington, Ky. ,

,What does this prove? Well, it proves that, in between,
Coach Bob Timmons’ roundballers lost more games thanthey
won‘ since they ﬁni.shed with a record of 11-14.

The Panthers’ last loss to Ken-‘

tucky was no earth"-shaking event
since very few teams, whether
good. or bad, beat the Wildcats on
their home court. Since the Cats
lost by only seven points it is
safe to presume that if Kentucky
would play at the,Field House’
the Cats would win. '
Never Had Lead
However, the game was not

played at the Field House and
‘the Wildcats stretched their re-

cordtto 18-7, one of the poorest
seasons Adolph Rupp has had at
Kentucky since 1941-42 when his
-team was 17-8.

The Blue and Gold never had
the lead Saturday. Kentucky
scored the ﬁrst basket and went
on to build an eight-point ad-
vantage before the Panthers
scored their first basket.

Action in the first half saw
Panther Forward Darwin Smith,
a native of Kentucky, foul out
with 3:35 to go. He scored two
points on free throws.

Trailed by 13
, At halftime the Cats trailed by
A13 points, 37-24, and the closest
they came to the Wildcats was
seven points. John Fridley, John

As Mittmen Begin
Spring Practice
Coach Bobby Lewis has his

Panther mitters going
through their pre—season

A ' . paces at the Field House. The

Panthers are preparing for
their ﬁrst game with Al-
legheny on April 9. ,

After the Cats tangle with A1-
legheny they will then face Ohio
State in a double header. These
two games will probably be the
toughest of the season since the
‘Buckeyes will already have better

_ than ten games under their belt.

Lewis is not crying, hovsfever,
for he has several lettermen re-
turning from last year’S Squad
which was defeated in the first

round of the NCAA tournament. .

One question mark will be the

first base position. Last year Ron

Maser held down that position but
he has had an operation this win-
ter and may not be able to play.
Maser was considered the best
ﬁelding ﬁrst baseman in college
last year but his batting average
was below .300. Both Lewis and
the team are hopeful that the big
left hander will be ready for the
season opener.

FRESHMAN BASEBALL

Freshman baseball practice
will begin this week. Anyone
interested should report to Dave

day at 3 p.m. Everyone is wel-

Mills and Bill Mauro led the Pan-

1/2 Point Difference

But, however, when Joe Mar-
shall of Navy edged the Blue and
Gold’s Earl McConnell by 1/2 point_
in the tumbling event it proved to
be the biggest joke of the two—day
tournament. ‘ l.

In the’ preliminary ‘competi-
tion on Friday night, McConnell
had his troubles and was rated
a'mark of 87 which was fair, but
when Marshall did four trips
down the mat in a clean Style
with the only difﬁcult move be-
ing at full twist, the crowd hissed

for a minute when the four
judges gave him a 90. v
.Realizing he was behind and
had to pull out all stops to .win
in the Saturday ﬁnals, McConnell
threw "his "best and most difficult
routine of the 1960 season. Pre-
.viously Marshall had performed
-his same simple routine and once
again was overrated with a 91%

Lands Off Mat

Now the decision was up to the
judges, and while they were tabu-
lating their 3results the entire
Panther ‘team rushed out to con-
gratulate McConnell on his ap-
parent" victory, but the sellout
crowd was startled when McCon-
nell was awarded a score of 94
and a total of 181 for the EIGL
tourney.

McConnell, only a sophomore,

still would have won the title if

oi! the mat on his last series of v
tricks on the ﬁnal trip.

The judges penalized him two
-points for this and the deduction
-swung the decision in favor of
Marshall. Panther Dave Hirst ﬁn-
ished third in tumbling with a
combined score of 169. V

Werner 3rd

at the Field House, Hirst once
again had a bad night in the pre-
liminary competition and lost to
the defending EIGL champ,
Army’s John Aaronson, by a nar-
row 189-185 margin on the ﬂying
rings. ‘
On Friday night Aaronson
built up a 596-90 lead on Hirst
due to holding two handstands
while Hirst suﬁered several
minor breaks. But on Satu_rday
.Hirst came out on top 95-93 but
it wasn’t enough to offset his
preliminary deﬁciency. Penn
State’s Jay Werner, the NCAA
champ, was next at 184.

Other Panther medals went to
Don Kasner for a fourth on the

long horse and McConnell for a
second in free exercise. Jack Rain-
aldi surprised everyone by ﬁnish-
ing seventh on the high bar. Kas-
ner ended up ﬁfth on the parallel
bars. ‘

The meet’s individual winners
were Greg Weiss of Penn State
in the Olympic all-around event
and P—bars, State’s Lee Cun-
ningham captured the side horse

Mighty Mites
Prepare For
Tournament I

prepare for the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Wrestling tour-
nament at Princeton Univer-

sity at Princeton, N. J., this
Saturday. '

Coach Rex Peery will take the
same line-up that has been wrest-
ling most of the dual meet season.’
The first four weight classes have
been set most of the year but
there have been some changes in
the 157 and 167 pound classes.

This situation was cleared up
when Bill Robb broke his ankle
while preparing , for the Penn
State meet. This means that Peery
will have to go with August Arri-
gone at 157 and Joe -Schmitt at
167.

g The Pantherswill put four un--
beaten records on the line when
they go afterthe Eastern title.
Mighty Mites, Dick Martin and
Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington
and John (three seconds) Zoli—

koff, the mad Russian, have not
been beaten.

In addition to these four Peery
will be expecting strong show-
ings from Len Vuocolo, Tom Hall
and Bob Guzik. Hall may be seed-
ed number one in the 191' pound
division and has a good chance
to win his class.

Guzik should place in the first
four since he was only beaten 2-1,
by Johnston Oberly, who is con-
sidered the number one heavy-

weight in the east.

At the beginning and the end

One Can Only‘ Shout
All one can do is shout and say
many things simply for their own

thing may be learned from all this

The whole second act exem-
pliﬁes his deﬁnition of tragedy.
Antigone refuses to abandon her
goal of burying her brother,
despite Creon’s logical reason-
ing, and ﬁnally threats, to the
opposite. Shouting ideals at one

words, moral law exists. Antigone
recognized this, whereas Creon

‘ failed to do so, and this is the

true tragedy of “Antigone.”
-It was quite a relief and not
at all intellectually insulting to

’ View a play where its meaning

and purpose were so visibly
brought to the surface; as such
was done by Anouilh through
the-dramatic device of a narra-
tor. _
Nothing was lost by the ab-
sence of costuming and pictur-

credit must be given to the sup-

Mary Ann Martucci was car-
ried awaywith her difﬁcult role

of‘ overacting. Her performance,
however, was overshadowed
onlyby the excellent jobturned
in by Louis Everstine as Chorus.
Jay Lerman as First Guard and
Don. Morcom. as Creon deserve

much praise, especially Morcom-

who had the longer and more de-
manding part. '

tragedy in his interpretation of

Rosalind “Roz” Roth, freshman
elementary ed Newsie. She loves

sports of all kinds» and just to ’

prove it she gets up at 6:30
EVERY morning to commute to

Roz, who says she likes to do
daring things, proved it by work-
ing in the Registrar’s office this
summer making "out schedules.
Furthermore, when asked how she
would describe the ideal male, she
said there isn’t one. Lotsa cour-
age, that gal.

But she is really a lovable little
bundle of --fun, as the girls in

Though she is just a pledge, she

likes to work with children and

finds it very satisfying.
