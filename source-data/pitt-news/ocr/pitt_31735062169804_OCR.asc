 

The University announced an in-
crease in its dormitory room and
board rates as a result of the in-
creasing costs of operations. The
new increase of $50 a term will go
into effect this September.

"Unwelcome as" the news is, it
could have been worse."-accord-
ing to David Ginevan, director of
University Housing. “During the
past term, we worked with the
Residence Hall Advisory Board to
find ways to minimize it as much
as we could. We received excel-

lent suggestions and were able to .

implement three of them."

 

The Housing Office took steps
to hold down the increase:

—Some rooms temporarily pressed
into service last September to
increase the number of student
accommodationswill be reclass-
ified as permanent accommoda-
tions for future use.

—A mandatory full board plan will
be required of all students.

—Considerable effort will be made
to increase the use of residence
hall facilities during the spring
term.

"By bringing up the occupancy.
we were able to defray some of the
cost," Mr. Ginevan said. "The

same holds true for the board plan _

By having everyone on full board.
we were able to hold down the
cost for the individual.”

In the past, graduate students
were permitted to purchase tickets
for only one meal or for two meals
Monday through Thursday with
full board on weekends. "An ex-
ception still will be made for stu-
dent teachers,“ Mr. Ginevan said,

The proposed cost schedule
per term, for the residence
halls is:

—Single accommodations in
the Tower Dormitories . $585
—Double accommodations
in the Towers or Quad-
rangle Dormitories . . . . $550
—-Pitt students in Medical
Center Nurses Residence

accommodations . . . . . $500 '

“but-everyone else will be on full
board."

The rooms to be permanently re-
classified were former lounge and
study areas. There were 13 such

rooms in the towers dormitory, one

on each three-floor unit. Each of
these was converted into double
rooms. In the four dormitories in
the quadrangle, lounge area space
was converted into suites for a to-
tal of 30 additional beds. In all the
increase amounts to 56 beds.

Mr. Ginevan said he hoped.to_ 

see the use of residence hall faci-
lities increase up to 50 per cent in
the spring term.

 

SUB Debate Lists
Hentoff, Farmer

NAT HENTOFF JAMES FARMER

James Farmer. a pioneer in developing non-violent direct
action methods for the resolution of race relations, will debate
Nat Hentoff. a white radical tomorrow at 7 p.m. in the CF audi-
torium.

Mr. Farmer has a diversified background. ranging from a
founder of CORE in 1942 to an author in 1966.

In February, 1961, he became national director of CORE, a g;
position which he held until early in_.1966, when he resigned in 
order to head a national literary program under the aegis of the 
Center for Community Action Education. Since his resignation, ’
he has turned more towards writing, and his column, “The Care 

of It,” has appeared in the Amsterdam News. He has also pub-
lished since that time his first full-length book, Freedom—When?

Whereas Farmer is a moderate. Nat Hentoff is a radical.
For the past few years, he has been writing and speaking against
American policies in Vietnam. He was one of the first few hun-
dred signers of “A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,” which
pledges support of young men who resist the draft. His recent
Playboy article. “The War on Dissent.“ presents a definitive his-
tory of dissent in this country, for uses on the directions and
intensity of current dissent among both the young blacks and

oung white. I I

the rest of the week

Variety is the word that best describes the activities of Un-
ion Week, sponsored by the SUB. Lectures, films, debates and
parties are just a- few of the activities scheduled for this week.

A lecture demonstration in the art of pantomime will be
Friday’s happening. Tony Montanaro and Company will con-
duct the program, entitled “A Mimes Eye View," at 12 p.m. and
will present a performance at 8 p.m., both in the SU Ballroom.

Saturday’s featrues are a Trivia Bowl and a dance. The Tri-
via Bowl to be held at 8 p.m. in the SU Ballroom will deal with
lesser known and selfdom remembered facts. Three man teams
will compete in the take-off on television‘s GE College Bowl.
The SUB will also host a dance at 9 p.m. in the Ballroom.

Union Week will conclude on Sunday with a Skating Par-
ty at 7:30 p.m. at the Civic Arena. Buses will leave from SU at
7 p.m. The entire trip costs 50 cents per person.

Monday's events included a lecture, entitled "The Essen-
tials of T. S. Eliot." and a film concerning “Hunger in Amer-
ica." Tuesday features the film. "The Phantom‘ of the Opera,”
and a Bridge Lesson. Wednesday's concert featuring Martha
and the Vandellas and the Brooklyn Bridge had to cancelled due
to circumstances beyond the control of the SUB. They will at-
tempt to plan another concertfor later in the term. Refunds will
be available at the SU Desk starting Feb. 3 for those who pur-
chased tickets. A '

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH Wednesday, January 29, 19695 I 

Chancellor ‘Deplored’ Sit-In .

BAS ‘Demands’ Analyzed

I regret that the black students felt they had to  '7 

As the result of recent incidents at this and
many other universities, I believe it is important
to clarify the meaning of certain policies and ob-
ligations as they relate to racial issues at this insti-
tution. ’

It is by now widely recognized that modern
universitites are entering a new era in which they

imust engage in relevant public service and must

commit themselves to help solve such problems as
the urban crisis and social_disorder. I. have not only
supported this view, I have asserted that the high
quality and strengths of the University of Pitts-
burgh enable it to exercise leadership. Already in
this institution, the federal government, the Com-
monwealth, and numerous foundations are investing
millions of dollars in our research and investiga-

‘ tive resources that apply to urban and social prob-

lems.

Our responsibilities cannot ‘be met only in the
laboratory, however. The problems of racial injus-
tice is the most critical domestic issue facing this
nation, and thus every institution must help, for ex-
ample, by recruiting black staff members and exe-
cutives, providing resources requested by black
communities, and by opening to black citizens all
the rights and options of free choice that comprise
true democracy. As for our part specifically, the

university’s commitments include expansion of en- ’

rollment of black students, expansion of employ-
ment of black faculty and staff, and sponsorship of
Afro-American studies. These are legitimate pro-
grams, initiated for the most part by black mem-
bers of the university, supported by our faculties
and trustees and, I hope, endorsed by most of our
students. They are not unusual programs, for coun-
terparts are being developed in many universities.

A few days ago, as you know, a number of black
students occupied the Computer Center. When in-
formed of this, I assembled staff advisors and a
number of faculty members including officers of
the Senate. Through an intermediary, we learned
that the main concern of these students was the
lack of progress by the university on commitments
already made. We reached an agreement with the
students, and they left the center promptly and
peacefully. The elements of the agreement have
been published in the student newspaper. Most of
the elements are restatements of previous commit-
ments, and some of them I agreed to refer to ap-
propriate faculties and other authorities.

It is our policy that the rights of those in the
university and the "rights of those who support it do
not permit interference with university functions or
threats to its property. Moreover, it is the duty of
every university officer to maintain an orderly aca-
demic environment’and to insure the personal safe-
ty of university members, "black and white. Obvi-
ously. this policy and this duty do not always pre-
sent unambiguous choices. In this instance. we be-

‘ lieve we were able to establish communication and

confirm a mutual understanding before legal action
became necessary. V .

take disruptive action in order to bring the depth of

their concern to the attention of this academic com-' "

munity. I agree that the response to racial inequi-I
ties has been slow and unsatisfactory in many re-
spects. However, any occupation of a facility, or
interference with a university function, is danger-

ous and to be deplored. It disrupts the spirit of the , . f

university and it could, in fact, serve to defeat

through reaction the cause being espoused by‘ the-.».

participants,

I would point out thatgeffective dialogue, verbal »   V _.
objection, peaceful assembly and written criticism ,5}. :~ 5*
_ are most powerful tools of persuassion and that they ,

should thrive in a university.

Finally, let me call upon every student to be".
self-critical and temperate in his attitudes and ac'-‘‘ . ,
tions regarding racial problems. Bigotry‘and unre-  9
strained militancy are both obstacles to any sensi- 
ble solution. I believe that progress in our racial 
programs is inevitable—the only question is whether; g,
that progress will be made smooth by reason and A ,
conscience, or made difficult by mindless bias or 
opportunism. All of us in this nation have a duty as 
citizens to support that progress; as members of an 
academic community, we ought to welcomethe ,

special opportunity we have to speed it.

named one of the tournament’s outstanding speakers. Twenty-six
teams from major colleges and universities were present at the
two day session. The topic of the debate was: “Resolved That the
Executive Influence on U.S. Foreign Policy Should Be Curtail-

The first proposal sets into motion

 the plan for an'All—University Coun-

 a body that would insure increased

dent participation in University gov-
ernance by establishing a parallel
student-faculty senate committee, by
extending student representation on
faculty and administrative commit-
tees; and by establishing commu-
nity government involving students,
faculty and administration.

Essentially, the Schueler proposal
will make the university community
more cohesive. In the fall our pages
were packed with complaints about
the lack of communicationsbetween
the administration, faculty, and the
students. This seems to us one good
way of partially solving this prob-
lem. A community spirit should be es-
tablished at the University.

Perhaps the most important phase
of Schueler’s second proposal con-
cerns the expansion of the Faculty
Senate Council to include the Student
Body President, the Pitt News Editor,
the Chairman of the Academic Cabinet,
and the President of the Engineering
Cabinet. The presence of students in
the Faculty Senate Council can-only im-
prove governance in this institution.
Indeed, the Council considers many im-
portant notions. And students should
be “in” on the dialogue that eman-
ates from the Council. It is the im-
portant link between the students,
faculty, and administration. It is our
belief that these proposals —— ideas
which will alter university structure
— should be passed Friday by the Fac-
ulty Senate.

 

Numerous times. requests have been

respond with the contract price of a qual- V -

In this situation. Martha and the Vandel-

. las were signed because their weeknight

concerts are considerably cheaper than
Saturday concerts: probably. if they were
signed for a weekend. which it was too
late to do once plans for the concert were
formulated. interested students would not
have minded paying a slightly higher price
for tickets. Anyhow. we could not have had
our pick of entertainers as the concert
was first discussed late last term when
top groups and their prices were at a pre-
mium.

This incident should emphasize the im-
portance of getting student opinion about
concerts and planning ahead. so as to ful-
fill those opinions. It is a shame that
$2000 has been spent with nothing re-
ceived in return. but. this week SUB. we
give you "the flying fickle finger of fate
award."

There is a growing feeling in certain cir-
cles around the University that the Sports
Editor of The Pitt News should be a cheer-
leader of sorts. After all. let's not give
those wicked people. the recruiters at oth-
er schools. any extra ammunition to out-
recruit us with leg. last November's black
page)_ .--..

Well. I find the posi-
tion of cheerleading in
The Pitt News person- -
ally repulsive. Jour- ’
nalistically, I can see
no rationale for paint-
ing glowing pictures
when there is no fac-
tual basis for it. But
nevertheless. today I W " “
do write as Roy Jacobs. *-JACOBS
concerned student. and not as Sports Edi-
tor of The Pitt News. I

TO TELL THE TRUTH,/I was a bit’
turnsed off by Sunday's announcement of
Carl DePasqua as head football coach and
even further alienated. shall we say. by
his addition of Bimbo Cecconi to his staff.
And the general campus reaction approxi-
mated my own.

This reaction. I think. was not to DePas-
qua himself. but rather to what he stands
forand the direction Pitt is heading. Af-
ter talking for three weeks about people
from Arizona State. Oregon State. and Wy-
oming. we were suddenly swept back to the
days of John Michelosen. who. incident-
ly. only won seven more games than he lost
in his 10 years. Now we are expected to
rally behind the Blue and Gold. utter nary a
word of dissent. and anxiously await the
next new head coach in three. four. or
five years. ‘-

    

 

 

Let us not be complacent in our accept-
ance of' DePasqua as head football coach.

 T oday’s Quote

Ed Norton, of the Honeymooners, gives his ‘Sew-

er Philosophy’ on life:
“When the tide of

you're sure it's just not your day, lie on your back, for-
get your troubles and float, float away.”

Instead. question why men of the caliber
Of Lloyd Eaton. Dee Andros. and Frank
Kush. desired not to come here. even when.
in Kush's case. it meant tremendous per-
sonal embarrassment.

ATHLETIC DIRECTOR Myslinski
quickly got the best man he could. I cannot
quarrel with that. But what is it about Pitt
that means we can‘t do any better? Did
men like Bob Odell and Carmen Cozza shy
away from the job. too? ‘

But to knock DePasqua at this stage is
irrelevant. He's here. and good choice or
bad. he‘s here for a long time. ‘But there
are other questions which need answer-
ing at this stage regarding the athletic
program.

True. it is not desirable for opposing
recruiters to have a black page to show
high school athletes what sports are like
at Pitt. But is the answer to cover up our
weak spots ‘with platitudes or to bring
them to light so something is done about
them‘? Where are our values?

Is it possible to build a winning atti-
tude when there‘s nothing winning about
the program ‘?

THE ANNOUNCEMENT of DePas-
qua just seems to fit right into the Pitt

_Mo1d. And he may just be another in-

nocent victim like Dave Hart and DePas-
qua’s former boss John Michelosen.

There are too many contradictions in
Pitt athletics. Too many contradictions
between us and the schools we play and
too many contradictions between what is
said and what is done. If it is my job as
Sports Editor to cover up these contra-
dictions for the benefit of appearance.
then I shrink from my job. But I am un-
able to separate my feelings as an individ-
ual from my duties as a journalist.

Student Exploitation

 

b DAMAINE MARTIN
Staff News Writer

I live on Atwood Street. Everybody
knows where that is — down Forbes past
the drugstore. turn left. Yes. everybody
knows. especially the students that live
there. those students who park their Mus-
tangs and \/W's before the frame turn-of-
the-century houses that line the street and
then climb the stairs of those same houses
to apartments on the second and third
floors.

THAT'S THE WAY it is on Atwood St.
The old people. those who either own the
houses or more often lease just a single
room. live on the first floor just a few feet
away from the shiny Mustangs. Above the
old people. i_n story after story of apart-
ments. live the students.

But it‘s no fun to live on Atwood Street.
The landlords there who rent apartments
to students know that they have a vir-
tually captive clienteleti and they take full
advantage of the situation. Rents.’ to put it
mildly. are exorbitant. The apartments.
often lack such essentials as locks on the
doors! Faulty plumbing. no heat. and broken
appliances are prevalent. One student
tells of the wiring in his apartment be-
ing so poor that he is unable to use one-
third of the outlets.

THE SITUATION doesn't stop at Atwood
Street. On Bates. on Dawson. on McKee
Place. on Oakland‘ Avenue. the same com-
plaints can be heard. and what they all add
up to is the factthat much of the STUDENT‘
POPULATION IN“ OAKLAND, IS BEING.

EXPLOITEDX — I. .-

Whether they seek apartments by choice
or by virtue of being denied University
housing. the chances are that these stu-
dents will be taken advantage of. For the
convenience of living in Oakland. near to

the University. they will pay. and pay heav-

ily. A friend pays $170.00 per month for a
four room walk-up. His stove has an oven
that hasn’t worked since Sept. 10. and
neighter the bathroom nor the kitchen are
heated. I

Obviously. this student exploitation can- —

not continue. Whether or not the business
community and property owners of Oak-
land recognize the fact. students spend a,
lot of money. and they may not always
choose to spend that money in Oakland.

The day may come when University

- students choose to forego convenience for

more equitable leases in Shadyside or
Squirrel Hill. The landlords would do well
to heed the fable about the goose that laid
the golden egg.

ASIDE FROM THE pure economics of
the situation. however. the fact remains
that students are in effect being penalized
for attending the University.

An urban location. an overflowing stu-
dent population. and arshortage of Univer-
sity housing as well as off-campus hous-
ing combine to make it difficult for stu-
dents to obtain comfortable housing at an
equitable price.

The “rising cost of education" has come
tofmean not only higher tuitions and city

 

fr

taxes. but also exploitation. student ex- I

ploitation.

‘News And PR’

Editor. The Pitt News,

After reading Bruce Leven-
son's column in the Jan 21 issue.
I thought I‘d drop you a line to
sympathize with you. As a mem-
ber of the WPGH News Staff. I
too have had the same problems.

The events of that Wednesday
moved quickly, and had it not
been for the many reporters we
had scattered around campus,
we would have known nothing of
what was happening. By 6 p.m
Wednesday. the WPGH News
Staff had fed most of the major

broadcast stations in Pittsburgh §
with at least six up-to-the minute 
interviews and reports of what was 

happening on campus. As a sub
scriber to UPI, we also fed sev-
eral stories to UPI, all of which
were carried intact on the Penn-
sylvania wire.

At 8 p.m. we carried a live
news special concerning the
events up to that time. When
one of our callers informed us
of the events at the Computer
Center. we were astonished. but
afterreceiving reliable confirma-
tion, we carried this story too. as
well as informing area Radio
stations of the events.

At no time during that even-
ing were we called by anyone
on the University News and Pub-
lic Relations staff; and at no time
that evening were we able to con-
tact them for any information. It
was obvious to anyone who list-
ened to the radio at all on Wed-
nesday that the news stories re-
garding the uproar at Pitt were
emanating from WPGH Radio,
yet nobody took the trouble to
either help us or even let us know
what was happening.

Director Apologizes To News

Editor. The Pitt News,

I read Bruce Levenson’s ‘column
in the Tuesday, January 21 issue
of The Pitt News with some sad-
ness, primarily because I feel he
misplaced the blame for the -ad-
ministration’s failure to communi-
cate the agreement with the
Black_ Action Society on the night
of the computer center sit—in. The
fault is mine and mine alone and,
as you know, I have already tend-
ered my apologies to you and to
George Lies.

Both the Chancellor and Assis-
tant Chancellor Jack Critchfield
told me during the evening that
we were to communicate the re-
sults of our deliberations to the
student media as soon as there
was something to communicate.
Mr. Critchfield also told me that
The Pitt News staff would be
working throughout the night and
asked me in particular to be sure
that the student newspaper was
covered. We did, in fact, inform
thepublic media between ‘three
and four o’clock in the morning. I

have no great excuse for over- _

looking The Pitt News. I just,
plainly and simply in my sleepy
state, forgot.

I realize that this situation has
put you in a very embarrassing,
position. and I would like to apol-

= ogize now publicly, both to The

Pitt News and. through The Pitt
News, to the students of the Uni-
versity and. in particular. to the
black students of the University.
I hope you will accept my earnest
assurances that there was no more
significance to this than just what
I have described. I myself, find
my own neglect particularly ap-
palling because of my long ser-

vice on the University's Student __
_ l,Pu_b1ications‘Boards - - -V

I do pledge to you. however.
that my office will redouble its
efforts to pay particular attention
to student publications and broad-
casting media in the future.

Sincerely.

In his column the author appeared
to be very annoyed because ac-
cess to a University facility and
the freedom of the press had been
denied a student organization. He
also demanded that those respon-
sible for this violation either be
forced to abide by the rules or
be punished through dismissal.

In early December. after hav-
ing been referred to Vice Chancel-
lor Edison Montgomery as the re-
sponsible administrator. we found
that Mr. Montgomery was not only
ignorant of Mr. Beers refusal to
print Alternatives No. 4. but
also unaware that Alternatives
even exists. Mr. Mongtomery's
statement in the January 23 issue
of the Pitt News indicates quite
clearly that his ignorance has not
flagged to this day.

We at Alternatives are not
championing obscenity as Mr.
Montgomery would have the read-
ers of The Pitt News believe.
This entire controversy has aris-
en because Alternatives, being a
recognized student organization.
has demanded complete and open , , .
access to this University‘s print-
ing facilities. regardless of the
tastes of one employee there. Mr.
Montgomerys assertion ‘that our
"urge to use vulgar words is
merely a sign of impish imma-
turity” only serves to underscore
his complete miscomprehension of
what issues are involved.

But this too neatly skirts the is-
sue~—a maneuver‘ at which most
administrators seem skilled. The
Editors of Alternatives want their
publication printed at University
facilities because just as they
are responsible to values greater
than their own,’ so. too is Mr.
Beers. His own prudish sense of
right and wrong simply will not
do. If this is not an issue of free-
dom of speech than it is one of
academic freedom in an institu-
tion that loves to bask in'that
vocabulary.

Since Mr. Montgomery. Mr.
Beers. Mrs. Kitzes. and a host
of other administrators continue
to raise the spectre of obscenity.
it may be of interest to note that
the words in question most assur-
edly pass the lips of these hypo-
critical critics at least once a
day.

SG ‘Final R0 und—up In The Sky’

The quality of education and academic
freedom were constant themes of the
Schueler administration. themes that pro-
duced results. The Cabinet of the Arts and
Sciences made an extensive study on
course evaluation. ROTC. the advising
system and the honors program. The Cabi-
net pushed for senior pre-registration and
got it. The Cabinet pushed for an interdis-
ciplinary program in Afro-American af-
fairs and got it. The Cabinet pushed for

.the abolishment of the ROTC credit and
gotit. ‘

SG TAKES A STAND _
Early in the Schueler administration.
University .students,were faced with the
‘possibility of a tuition increase. In behalf
of the students. SG used every means to’
prevent this added financial‘ building. A
strong SG bill. a massive letter-writing
campaign. and the mass media were all
employed to stop the increase. But. despite
SG's valiant efforts. the tuitionwas in-

‘creased.

Realizing the responsibilites and
awareness of today‘s youth. Student Gov-_
ernment endorsed the 18-year-old vote and
urged its immediate adoption.

During the term when several meal
tickets at the University cafeteria were
confiscated unjustly, the SG Senate re-
sponded by calling the action “unwarrant-
ed,” and making several demands on Saga
Food. ‘

In May. when the Poor Peoples Cam-
paign was in Pittsburgh. SG President
Schueler recommended to the University
that it provide a number of the 1.400 va-
cant rooms that were available in the quad
and Tower A. The University subsequent-
ly agreed to supply 500' rooms and food
services to the campaign. '

To facilitate the parking of motorcy-
cles in the cycle parking area located di-
rectly below the Quadrangle. Student Gov-'
ernment requested a cutting of the curb.
This proposal was made after several stu-
dents complained to SG about damage to

‘ their cycles as a result of dropping off the-

curb.

   
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  

  
  
   
   
  
  

 The reversal in registration policy
eisulted from long discussion and applied
ife”s’sure by Schueler, the Cabinet of the

rts and ‘Sciences and the Senate. '

9.5-‘There is no explicit, satisfactory state-
ment on the_goals and philosophies of a
b_eral Arts education at this institution,
hatl can be used as a guideline”,
I These’ were words also spoken by SG
_esident Ken Schueler, words before a’
’ culty’Senate meeting, words that could
fiﬁiit have been spoken to this body last
year at all. For in 1968 another SG break-,
ough allowed two student representa-
ives to sit on Faculty Senate Committees,
ile, for the first time, a provision was
de granting the president of SG the
-right to address the Faculty Senate. Among
._he'-proposals made to the Faculty Senate
yv?SG_was the establishment of a special
study to evaluate the quality of undergrad-
 te and graduate education at the Uni-
ersity. Included in this evaluation would

ms, size of classes, grading and the role .

SG AND STUDENT RIGHTS

“Student Government at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh recognizes and supports
the student power movement as a move-
ment designed to gain for students their
full rights as citizens, their right to demo-
cratically control their non-academic lives,
and their legitimate participation to the
fullest extent in the administrative and ed-
ucational decision-making process of the
University.” -

In mid-September this resolution was
to be the keynote for the Student Govern-
ment of 1968-69. Although there would be
quibbling and frowns_concerning “student

power.“ SG recognized the need for a real

student voice and rights that accompanied.
it. Apart from the strides made in educa-
tional reform and academic freedom, SG
took a giant step when it established a

Legal Awareness Committee to" guarantee

students due process and procedural safe-
guards in the field of campus discipline.
The Legal Awareness Committee was and
is the most valuable‘ means of. protecting

it has published pamphlets on student leg-
al rights. g,

in early January. after Central Printing
refused to print an issue of Alternatives,
Student Government labeled the action as’
an attempt to stifle freedom of speech and
demanded a reversal in decision. The is-
sue is still pending.

To further insure student rights. Stu-_
dent Government established that tickets
for Homecoming. Winter Weekend. and
similar events sponsored by SG would be
sold only on an individual first-come-first-
serve basis. The Senate felt it was its duty
to see that the limited number of tickets
available for events be distributed as fair-
ly as possible among the members of the
University community without favoritism
for any single interest group. In the past.
bloc tickets were sold for campus organ-
izations with individuals getting second
priority. -

SG AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

One of the primary areas of concern of
this year's Student Government was aca-
demic integrity. SG action came in three
different spheres. First. at the very begin-
ning of the administration. SG pushed for
abolishment of the ‘change-of-course fee.
The rationale used was that the change of
educational programs are academic deci-
sions which should not be subject to mone-
tary considerations".

Secondly. SG fully investigated the
"behaviour of ROTC Department mem-
bers" in regards to student protestors and
the way the'i‘RO'I‘C Department seeming-
ly condoned physical action by its “si-
lence." More importantly. SG. after care-
ful» review of the academic control of
ROTC. the discrepancies in credits. etc..

voted to endorse the de-crediting of ROTC ’

programs.

Finally. SG began to consider an hon-
or code for Pitt legislation concerning
adoption of such a code will be up before
the Senate shortly.

SG LENDS ITS SUPPORT

Throughout the 1968-69 Student Gov-
ernment term, the Senate and the Execu-
tive supported several drives which
brought distinction tothe University com-
munity. Student Government aided the
baseball team financially in their attempt
to meet traveling expenses to California.‘
After the outstanding success of the-Pitt
College Bowl team. Student Government
sponsored a reception for the team mem-
bers with Chancellor Posvar speaking. In
November, Student Government sponsored
"Choice '68“ on. campus — a nationwide
collegiate presidential primary. In De-
cember. _SG money and support went to
Mary Ann Zovko in her attempt to become
NCAA football queen.

Student Government has also establish-
ed a committee to investigate a book co-op
for University students. The book co-op is
tentatively set for next September. Under
the co-op students could return price lists
to the Book Store for a percentage of the
profit at the end of the term.

is one of the best ways to provide for stu-
dent residential areas and that co-opera-
tive housing is a great way-to provide for
basic human needs such as privacy, terri-
toriality, and comfort, the Student Govern-
ment in October established a Committee
on Cooperative Housing and sent represen-
tatives to the Cooperative ‘Housing Con-
ference in Washington, D. C. This action

by SG was the first real student attempt to.

meet the needs of University housing.

To provide an area where students can
at all times speak their minds. Student

»,Government has worked for the establish-

ment of a-Free Speech podium on campus.
After much investigation and evaluation
the Free Speech podium will soon become
a reality. _ '

so AND NSA

Contending that,it was in the interest
of the Student Gov’err1ment of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh to join a national stu-
dents organization and that the United
States National Student Association is the
largest and most representative student or-
ganization. Student Government in April
joined NSA. Joining NSA came after
months of debate and discussion and a stu-
dent referendum showing the electorate to
be uninformed on the question. Being a
member of NSA. SG has gained access to
the valuable NSA ‘research. had made
available the NSA services -to the student
body, and has provided cogent ideas which
have certainly helped to stimulate this
year's SG.

SG AND ELECTION PROCEDURES

In an attempt to insure fair campaign
practices, SG Senate passed a bill restrict-
ing expenditures in the next SG election.
Parties with presidential candidates are
limited to $200, individual‘ candidates are
restricted to $35. The SG Senate required
all candidates to submit notarized certifi-
cation of campaign expenditures.

SG will continue‘ the practice of get-
ting voting machines to facilitate the elec-
tion.

The «Draft Physical

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

The morning mist was just be-
ginning to rise. and Jim could see
the Federal Building in the near
distance. It was a modern look-
ing structure with greenish rec-
tangular windows. It was impres-

sive, but not awe-inspiring.

Jim had butterflies in his
stomach on this morning. He was
going to take his physical exam
to qualify for Armed Forces. “The
people are pretty decent down
there,” one friend had told him.

Inside the building, Jim went
to the elevator and pushed the
button. It would take him to the
15th floor. Once there. the blue-
uniformed recruiters , promptly
gave him six forms to fill out and
instructed him to report to room
1728.

The atmosphere in room 1728
was somewhat antiseptic. But
there were so many human bodies
walking around there that the mis-
ture of body odor and alcohol
was unmistakable. The check-in
man gave Jim a small blue bag.
“Put your wallet and watch in
the bag, and carry the bag around
with ya during‘ the physical. [ts

“too god-damned bad if you lose

your valuables. Get that straight.”

When Jim went through the
double metal door just to the
left of the check-in desk. he‘pick-
ed up a uniformed escort — Ser-
geant Smith. The Sergeant point-
ed to a small rectangular area
with brown tiled flooring. There
were about twenty in the locker
area in empty silence. "All right
you lunks," bellowed Sergeant
Smith. strip — I said strip now.-
Take all your smelly clothes off

‘ except your shorts and shoes. That

doesn‘t mean your shoes and
socks, damn-it. If anyone goes
around here with his smelly
socks, we’ll take your little ass
back here and we‘ll take off your
damn" socks. Do you got that
straight‘? ‘

Jim’s group was getting undres-
sed. One of the kids walked over
to the Sergeant and asked him if

, he could go to the bathroom.

"Can‘t you read the damn sign. you

_ lunk. The sign says ‘Do Not_ urin-

ate until you finish the physi-
cal.’

“But I really have to go — real
bad.”

“God-damn-it. Go ahead and
take a piss, but ya better save a
little of it, or else you’ll hold that
little cup at the piss station un-
til it’s fill. I don’t give a damn if
you stay there all day.” _

The young kid shuffled back to
the locker with a sheep—like ex-
pressionon his face. He looked
at the group, but couldn’t see
anyone. And Smith rocking slowly
on his heels has this big face-
wrinkled grin on his ugly face.

Schueler Propo

To provide for greater student and fac-
ulty involvement in the decision-making pro-_
cess of the University, SG spokesman Pres-
ident Ken Schueler made two proposals at
the January 20th Faculty Senate meeting.
These proposals followed passage by the
Faculty Senate of two previous SG propos-
als: (1) The bill providing for twostudent

"All right creeps." the Sergeant
said. "were goin to take you on
a little tour of this place. were
goin to visit stations 1. 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. and 7 — that order. And Ser-
geant Doak is goin to be your per-
sonal guide."

Doak. a short man with a bull‘s
face. frowned at the group and
ordered: “Stand—up straight heel
to toe; don't tilt your heads, you
asses. Now were goin to march
over. station No. 1. Lets march
damn-it."

They marched over to No. l and
met up with a tall, fat, bald-
headed medic who ushered them
into the hearing test booth. The
group sat down in grey metal
chairs.

“Hey you with the big nose.
Get yQ1'ii' god-damned papers off
your lap. Everybody get your pa-
pers off your laps and put them in
front of you on the floor.‘O.K.
yuz guys, ya see the headphones
hanging on your ‘panels. The right
earphone has red marking and the
left earphone has a blue mark-
ing. Ya take the*left earphone
with the red marking and put it
over your left ear. Ya take the
right earphone with the blue mark-
ing and ya put it over your right

ear. The sign in front of ya says .

take the little buzzer an pushit
when ya hear sounds starting for
three minutes in the left head-
phone and going for three minutes
in the right headphone. When ya

- don‘t hear any sounds, don‘t push

the buzzer-. Ya got that? All
right, you lunks, the test last six
minutes. Let’s have a good test."

The frocked medic closed the
door and the test began. They
heard crazy sound vibrations for.al—
most six minutes. And then a tall
medic named Barns came in. "Lis-
ten to the instructions. We’re go-
in to leave this room and go out-
side. You go outside, go to the
grey table, pick up the pen in your
hand, go to one of the four walls,
and sign the paper I will give
you when you leave this booth.
Don’t use the god-damned table
to sign your name.

No one in Jim’s group was
smiling now. They weremarched
by Barnes tostation No. 2 — the
blood test center. Bryant was sit-
ting there in his eternal bore-
dom; shades covering his eyes
in the bright light. And he had
to have his fun.

"Stand in a line starting at this
desk. Take this piece of paper and
rip it apart. Then sit down in this
chair. hold your left arm out

governance. which would survey depart-
ments, divisions, schools, and the Univer-
sity on a systematic and periodic basis to
determine the extent and the modes for

making at the University. ‘

The second SG proposal recommends
the setting upof student committees in
Student Governmentfrom which student
representatives will be chosen for member-
ships to the faculty committees. These SG
committees‘wouldlparallel the following i

. Garbed in shorts and shoes with
his left arm doubled-up and his
right hand holding on to his pa-
pers, Jim went" down the crowd-
ed hall. He went to the urinal sta-
tion and tied to grab the cup with
his right hand. It was impos-
sible. So he put his papers on a
grey metal table just outside the
urinal station

 

 

“Who left his god-damned pa-
pers on this table,” screamed
Doak. “You did, big nose. Get your
god damn papers.”

" I can‘t do it that way, sir."
Jim pleaded. '

“I don't;give a damn if its hard
to piss into the cup with your
hands full. Ya do what your told.
Understand college boy. "

Jim bit his. tongue and remain-
ed silent. Somehow he managed to
fill his small cup with urine. He
was the last person to leave the
urinal station.

From there, Jim’s group march-
ed over to station six. It was a
big empty room with only three
chairs. The gray tiled floor with

plain except for about 12 separ-

ate strips of brown masking tape.

Barns. Brynat, and Dr. Rogers
stood before. the group. Then
Barnes took one step forward.
"OK. you smelly creeps. Line-

up in a straight line; heel to toe,
heel to toe. Keep your heads
straight. Don't tilt your head. big
nose. Just keep standing like that.
Understand?" ‘

Dr. Rodgers walked around the
empty room looking at the pos-
tures, feel, eyes and ears of the
group's, fat, skinny. light, dark,
and pimpled bodies.

“O.K. everyone," said Barnes.
"We’re goin to march over to the
left wall. Take off your shoes and
shorts. Put your shorts on top of
your shoes." and your valuable
bag on top of the heap. Now
march over to the center of the
room.

There was a moment of un-
expected and unknowing silence.
And Barnes snapped: “Stand with
your legs 8 inches apart. .On the
tap that doesn‘t mean 9 inches.
and it doesn't mean 7 inches.
Thats 8 inches apart. Turn your
heads to the left. Take both of
your hands and cover your moth.
Now cough.‘ And don’t cough on
the Doctor. "

“Anybody got hernia here, Dr.
Rodgers,” said Barnes.

/.

"No Barnes, you can proceed

I with the test."

“O.K. Lets keep our. feet 8
inches apart on the tap and put
our hands over our heads. Make a
fist. Now open and close your fist.
Can ya do this all right? Now
place your hands on your hips.
Move your hands to your knees.
Take your hands from that posi-
tion, and place them on your but-
tocks."

"What's that?" a voice asked.

“Your ass, stupid.” Spread

your buttocks and ‘keep them
spread until the Doctor taps_you
on the back.” ‘

After that ordeal, all the nude
forms went back to the wall of

 

Policies. Student Affairs. Academic Free-
and Tenure,
Procedures. Budget Po-licies, Admissions,

Organization’ and

Library and Plant Utilization.

Another aspect of this proposal calls for the
expansion of the Faculty Senate Council of
the University to include four undergraduate
and graduate students as voting members. '

/ .

The rationalebehind all these proposals
was given by SG President Schueler: "
students can contribute to the quality’ of
decision-making in the University and . . . it,
is therefore, in the best interest of the in-
stitution to involve, students in a ‘mean-

j ingfulrrole in policy-making.’,'  . ' ~ --

Pitt News Review

Brockett and Barbara Revue:
A Dry Run That Ran Too Dry

 

By JOHN DREYER
Staff News Writer

Don Brockett and Barbara Rus-
sell comprise the entire cast of
Brocket and Barbara Upstairs, a
satirical musical revue now on
stage at the Pittsburgh Play-
house. Neither member of the cast
is new on the Pittsburgh scene.
Brockett, a native of Pittsburgh.
has written several comedy
books. material for Phyllis Dil-
ler, the Vogues and others, in ad-
dition to writing and producing in-
dustrial shows that tour the coun-
try. Miss Russell has appeared in
many of Brockett’s industrial re-
vues, has been his partner in the
supperclub circuit and also does
some television work. Joanne Pas-
quinelli. a Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity graduate student of Mu-
sicology composes for and ac-
companies Brockett as she has

‘ done for eight years.

The show billsgitself "satire"
and satire it is; but what the bill-
ing fails to mention is that the
satire is too often poorf With oc-
casional originality, [Brockett
and Barbara run through a list of
“put-downs" including “Hunk-
ies,” striking teachers, favor-
ite Polack jokes. and recollec-
tions of their grammar school
teaching nuns. Likening the Pitts-
burgh teachers who recently
struck to longshoremen, Brock-
ett aroused the largely middle-
aged, middle-class audience to a
dishearteningly overenthusiastic
applause.

An excellent target for Brock-
ett’s satire was District Attor-
ney Robert Duggan’s anti-obscen-
ity campaign which culminated
in the closing 0L the ‘movie
Therese and Isabelle. Brockett
and Barbara extend the theme
with their own “lewd” jokes cen-
tering around such ‘offensive’
words as “crotch,” “urine test,”
and “bullshit.” An abortive ef-
fort to make fun of Rogers and
Hammerstein boasted such punch

_lines as “When you walk through

a storm think of Nathan Hale,”
and received appropriate audi-
ence reaction. .

Despite the overabundance of
old or bad jokes and Don Brock-
ett‘s irritating sub-bass voice,
humor and enjoyment can be
found in an evening with them.
Barbara Russell, although she
acted as ‘straight man‘ in many
of the sketches, craftily portrays
an enormous variety of charac-
ters, including a nun at a nudist
camp, a prostitute in a steam
bath. and a reminiscing old wom-
an. Unlike her partner. she was
not at all out of place in the few
serious numbers, and her singing
voice is pleasant.

The revue started and ended on
a very amateurish theme; a ju-
bilant song and dance vaguely
reminiscent of Another Opening,
Another Show, which rejoices,
"We‘re working in the theatre"
and tells how glad they both are to

"MZZl|N5! Once you see it, you'll never again picture
‘Romeo & Juliet’ quite the way you did before!” -4 LIFE

Old Groups SpawnNew

$2523;

By JOE ANDERSON
Staff News Writer

One of the very sad and omin-
ous developments of 1968 has
been the breakup of many long
established groups. Most "not-

able of these were: Big Broth-

er & The Holding Co., The Cream,
Buffalo Springfield, Traffic, and

the Electric Flag. A few split over 7

personality conflicts and some
over the fact that playing night
after night, session after ses-
sion, made too much work out of
a fun thing like music. Since the
parting of ways, many of the best
musicians from the defunct
groups have been showing up in
records, either jamming or as
backup personnel. Some others
have gone so far as to cut individ-
ual albums. Music gets in the
blood and though a few bad ex-
periences may make one a little
weary, eventually the alarms
sound anew.

 

Out of the breakup of the Buf-
falo Springfield (probably the one
group most grievously mourned)
came Steve Stills and Neil Young.
Stills of course was jamming
around with Mike Bloomfield and
Al Kooper and now is starting
some sort of anti-group with Da-
vid Crosby ‘(ex-Byrdl and Graham
Nash (ex—Hollie). Neil Young has
just come out with an album of
his own — Neil Young (RS-6317).
Young ‘was. always the most reti-
cent member of the Buffalo
Springfield. the one most prone
to spur-of-the-moment trips» to
England. His album is just amaz-
ing,‘with some of the best songs
Neil has ever written. The ar-
rangementsare all strongly rem-
iniscent of the Springfield era
with soft, sylph counterpoint
against Neil's half blue grass vo-
cal. A few annoyances come when
Neil’s voice gets lost in the shuf-
fle of too many backup instru-
ments. but these instances, being

unequalled in the chemical industry.

Since his departure from -the
Blood, Sweat & Tears, Al,Kooper
has been showing up all over the
place. Now he has an album out
of his own called, I Stand Alone
(CS-9718). A lot of the material;
is typical Kooper — strong brassy,
big band sound which somehow
still seems out of place in Rock.‘
Kooper is a genius both of the stu-

dio and his instrument, the or?

gan, but sometimes his horn’-
fixated arrangements get him in-,

to awkward resolutions. Nonethe”-E

less, there is too much talent in
Kooper to allow an album of his

stuff to go completely amiss.“

Songs like “Camille,” ‘.‘Colour-
ed Rain,” “Blue Moon of Ken,-
tucky” are good enough reasons,
why Al Kooper should be winning_
so much kudos of late. I Stand
Alone is important in understand-.
ing Al Kooper at work and at play;
(e. g.

 Out of the 13 events, Ohio
,...-Zplaced number one in all but
 three of them. They also finished
‘:'};,one-two in six of those contests.
 ‘School records were shattered
 three times and one pool record
 was broken. The outstanding per-
 formance of the evening was put
on by Dave Solomon of Ohio,
-who smashed the pool record for
“the 1000 yard freestyle, record-
_—iiig a time of 10:55.5, bettering
, , the old mark of 10:58.2. Solomon

The highlight of the evening,
 though, was the flawless diving
""9: _of’.Dave Wessel. Responsible for
f two of the three events the mer-
 Jmen did take, Dave awed the
 crowd from both the one-meter
 and the three-meter boards. He
 — ‘won the diving competition from
 "the low board with a point total
“of 233.15. Then, in the next to
 the last event, Wessel, for the
 ; ‘third straight time, shattered the
 Trees Pool record in the high
‘dive. Scoring a point total of
280.35, he bettered the record he
, had set just last week, by almost
  points;
 » Grant commented that Wessel
, has that “certain something ex-
tra,” that puts him up with the

 
  
  
  

  
  

‘   best divers around. “I always said,
 280 and he’s gone.”

The only explanation Grant can
give‘ for the jarring defeat ‘was
that Ohio U. was just too strong

_ and too deep. He also points out
 that a great many of the events
, -_ ,‘(six out of 13) use the freestyle as
 the basic stroke.

“The teams we’re meeting have
established freestylers. They can

Caldwell Beats Mountaineer Press
As Hoopsters Break Losing Skein

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The hoopsters broke a persistent West Vir-
ginia press last night, and marched off the
court with their long—time-in-coming third victory,
dumping the surprised Mountaineers, 90-87.

“We felt that if they pressed us,“ said coach
Buzz Ri_dl, “we could beat them.“

Ridl felt that if West Virginia pressed, the cag-
ers would either get through it and get the easy
shot or be in position to get the good percentage
shot. The cagers did a little of each, finished the
night with a remarkable 55.2 per cent, and pro-
duced their highest point output in four years.

“(Mike) Caldwell played a great game,” beam-
ed Ridl. “It was a great performance for a little
guy. It shows that there’s still a place for the little
man in basketball.”

Caldwell, who teamed with Purdue’s Rick
Mount at Indiana, displayed the best performance
of his short varsity career. The sophomore sharp-
shooter poured in 25 points, shooting 10 out of 18
from the floor. -

But it was Caldwell’s ball handling that broke
the cager’s ten—game losing streak. The 5’10” guard
kept the ball away from a persistent West Virginia
press for the last three-quarters of the game.

“We knew he was a pretty good ballhandler,”
said WVU coach Bucky Waters, “but we thought
our press could stop him. We were wrong. He play-
ed a great clutch game.”

Caldwell kept the cagers in the game, but it
took some clutch free throws from the benchmen
to win it. West Virginia, forced to play catch-up

basketball, continuously fouled the hoopsters.

“We knew that Withers had been shooting only
33 per cent from the line, and Causer only about
40 per cent,” explained Waters. “We hoped they
would miss, but they didn’t. They really came
through in the clutch.”

Actually, the Mountaineers failed to get at jun-

. ior center Jerry Causer, but sophomore Tom With-

ers went to the line 11 times. The Indiana_-bred
guard, who played the forward position for the
frosh last year, clicked on seven of his attempts.
Withers had scored on only one of three free throws
prior to last night in limited action this season.

Mike Riggle, another sophomore from the
school-yards of Indiana, also found a new home on
the foul line. The 64” forward converted all six of

.his free throw attempts, and four in the final 2:54.
_, He said he didn’t»feel the pressure though.

"After the first foul “shot,” said Riggle, “the
last three were easy.”

The cagers didn’t hit a field goal during the
last five minutes of play, but that was only be-
cause they didn’t get the chance to shoot. They
attempted 15 free throws during the drought, hit-
ting ll of them.

“We played a good game,” said .Waters, “but
they played a great one. They deserved it.”

The victory marked the first cager win over
the Mountaineers in nine contests. The last win
was in 1964, when the hoopsters finished on top,
92-76. “It was the greatest game since I’ve been
here, smiled Ridl. “I hope it"s the first of many

‘Proud’ grapplers Upset Clarion

by‘M RTHA HARTLE

Dave Adams’ matmen
went to Clarion “with fight
and pride that they were
from Pitt” and they came home
last night with their first dual
meet victory of the season, a 20-
14 upset over a Clarion squad
which was‘ ranked eighth in the
east in a pre-season poll.

“I can’t say enough about how
our boys wrestled,” exclaimed
Adams. “They wrestled like they
know how to wrestle. They just
wrestled their hearts out and did
a great job.”

Tom Grant (123), Larry Cuba
(130), Pat Lavery (137), Mark
Payne (145), Paul Allen (177),
and Ralph Cindrich (unl.) pick-
ed up wins for the grapplers, who
were forced to go with a patch-
ed up line-up due to a number of
injuries. .

“We had to use three 152
pound boys tonight,” Adams ex-

plained. “One wrestled at 160 A

 

and the other at 167. And Ron
Levandowski, a 167 pounder, had
to go at 19l.”

Cuba picked up a fall for the
varsity, pinning Clarion’s Keith
Taylor in 7:42. According to
Adams, both Grant and Payne
were also close to pins.

It was the first win of the sea-
son for Grant, who decisioned
Dave Baughman 6-2. “It took
Tom two periods to get going,”
commented Adams, “but in the
third period he really opened
up. He had that guy on his back
a couple of times.”

Paul Allen, normally a 191-
pounder, came down to 177 for
the Clarion contest and came
through with a crucial win, de-
.cisioning previously undefeated
Santo Ricotta, 3-1. Allen had a
slim lead going into the final
period, but was penalized a point
for locking hands. “If Ricotta
had gotten out, he would‘ have
won, but Paul rode him the

_ whole period and picked up two; .

.‘ _ _ .‘ _

more.”

Cubs Win Thriller

  In Typical Fashion

by BILL NAAB

In typical Cub basketball style, coach Tim Grgurich’s fresh-
man squad provided a sensational second half comeback to top-
ple the highly publicized West Virginia frost 71-70.

After the Cubs trailed 43-29 at halftime, they fought ‘back in
lightning-like fashion. Within the first seven minutes, the Cubs had
narrowed the deficit to three points, 49-46.

Hotshooting Steve Lewis who
led the team in scoring with 19
points accredited the second half
rally to coach Grgurich. “Grgu-
rich psyches you up,” said Lewis.
“He’s a great" coach and prepares
you for any situation.” 5

With 11:26 to go, Paul O’Gorek
sank a free throw to close the Lit-
tle Mountaineers’ lead to a mere
two points, 51-49. Even though
O’Gorek hit on two consecutive
shots and Kent Scott swished a

points riding time.”

Lavery also won a match on
riding time, as he edged Randy
Stine, 3-2. Payne, meanwhile.
won handily over Don McClure,
18-2. Cindrich remained unde-
feated, decisioning Gary Holl-
sopple, 4-1. Hollsopple’s only
previous loss was to a New Jer-
sey state champion by a 2-1 mar-
gin.

In other matches, Buddy Mor-
ris (152), who was sick before
this match, lost to Leslie Bress-
ler, 8-3; Marty Poel (160) was
shut-out by Mark Dymond. 5-U;
Greg McClure (167), in his first
varsity start, was pinned by Hen-
ry Shaffer and Ron Levandow-
ski (191) was blanked by Jack
Reigel, 10-0.

Adams had praise for P001,‘
McClure and Levandowski “who
made a bit contribution. Consi-
dering the conditions, this was
the best we wrestled all year."
he added.

short jump shot, the Mounties
widened their lead to eight
points, 61-53, with 7:21 remain-
ing.

Former Pennsylvania All-Stater
Will Robinson (22 points) made
three of the five baskets during
the Mountaineer hot streak.
However, the Cubs again nar-
rowed the lead to two points, 63-
61, and 67-65.

With only 2:41 left in the game
and the Cubs trailing, 67-65,
O’Gorek blocked a crucial field

goal attempt by Billy Wells. Scott

immediately sank the next Cub
basket to tie the game 67-all.

Then, suddenly, Will Robin-
son dimmed all Cub hopes when
he drove in for a quick bucket,
was fouled, and made the free
throw. Steve Lewis who has been
hitting clutchfield goals through-
out the game dropped in a vital
22-foot shot to put the Cubs just
one point behind, 70-69, with
about one minute to play.

The Cubs tied the score with
45 seconds remaining when Kent
Scott hit the first of a one and one
free throw. Then in the last 12
seconds" Curtis Price fouled Rod
Schoon. Schoon flipped the ball
through the nets, and after Rob-
inson missed a 15 foot jump shot
he got another chance to down
the Cubs on a long desperation
shot with just three seconds on
the clock. In all, the flashy Rob-
inson missed three important
shots in the last minute of action.

O’Gorek pulled down 18 re-
bounds, and Rod Schoon, accord-

.ing to Grgurick, “grew up to— .

night." As Steve Lewis said, “It
was a real team effort.”

  Something New at Field House:

Banner Hosts Pitt Track g Classic

by ED CONLEY

New things have been quite common since Jim Banners been go-
ing back and forth between Trees Hall and Fitzgerald Field House.
There‘s a new track layout in the Field House, the track and cross
country teams have brought many new triumphs, and the same two

squads have set numerous new
records.

That isn‘t all. however. Begin-
ning this Saturday. Pitt will have
a Track Classic of its own. thanks
again to Jim Banner.

The brand new meet, which the
coach hopes will be an annual af-
fair. will be launched at 10 a.m.
Saturday. and its designer can
hardly wait to see it in existence.
He has been waiting for its open-
ing for quite awhile.

“Last year, we wanted to do
it,” Banner mentioned, “but we
had the old track with the boards.
We thought someone might fall

' -through the thing, that it might

not be a healthyrthing. So, we
put it off.”

The Classic is readynow be-
cause Banner has the new "tar-

tan" track to work with. It cer-
tainly looks a lot better to the
schools that will be coming here.

One of those squads won't find
the turf new, though. Kent State
was here two weeks ago. getting
an early peek at it. The Golden
Flashes lost to Banner’s thinclads,
but they were definitely pleased
with the "new" Field House. The
comnents on the layout were
about the only favorable thoughts
for the Kent athletes that day.

There will be three other Ohio
teams joining the Flashes in the
Classic. Bowling Green, Ohio U.,

and Cleveland State are the other

Buckeye State competitors, while
Slippery Rock and Delaware
round out the seven-team line-up.

"We want to keep it small."

  

 

 
 

Does it really work?

If you've ever resorted to NoDoz® at 4 a.m.
the night before an exam, you’ve probably
been disappointed.

NoDoz, after all, is no substitute for
sleep. Neither is anything else we can
think of.

What NoDoz is is a very strong stim-  

ulant. In fact, NoDoz has the strongest
stimulant you can buy withouta prescrip-
tion.

Caffeine.

What’s so strong about that?

If we may cite The Pharmacological
Basis of Therapeutics: Caffeine is a
powerful central nervous stimulant. Caf-
feine excites all portions of the central
nervous system. Caffeine stimulates all
portions of the cortex, but its main action
is on the psychic and sensory functions.
It produces a more rapid and clearer flow
of thought and allays drowsiness and
fatigue. After taking caffeine, one is ca-
pable of more sustained intellectual ef-
fort and a more perfect association of
ideas. There is also a keener apprecia-
tion of sensory stimuli.

Very interesting. But why take

' ‘T.M.©1969 Bristol-Myers Co.

OH!‘ Pill-

NoDoz when you can get caffeine in a

cup of coffee?

Very simple. You take NoDoz all at
once instead ofsipping coffee for 10 min-
utes. And if you take two NoDoz tablets,
the recommended dosage, you get twice
the caffeine in a cup of coffee. A

Two tablets—isn’t that likely to be
habit forming? Definitely not. NoDoz is
completely non-habit forming.

Which means it’s safe to take
whether you’re cramming at night. Or
about to walk into an 8 o’clock class. Or
driving somewhere (even though you’re
rested) and the monotony of the road

makes you drowsy.

One last thing you should know
about NoDoz. it now comes in two forms.
Those familiar white pills you take with
water. And a chewable tablet called
NoDoz Action Aids“. It tastes like a choc-
olate mint, but it does everything regular

NoDoz does.

And ifyou’ve managed

to stay awake this
long,‘you know
that's quite a lot.

Arranges Track Classic

Banner reasoned. "With room for
only four runners we’ll have lots
of trials. The meet will last till
aboutfour.

“But, it’s something that‘s good
for us—good for Pitt——and good for

the boys that will be coming," he

continued.

There will be medals and tro-
phys for those boys, too. The
Alumni Varsity Lettermen have
given funds providing the awards
that will go to the winners in the
meet. This. too. is something new.
