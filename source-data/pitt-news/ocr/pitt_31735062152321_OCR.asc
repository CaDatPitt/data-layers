Approve Falk
School Design;
Ask F_<_)__r Bids

Begin Construction of
Building by End

of Year

 

The design formally accepted by
the University, advertisements for
bids will be made within the next
month and the contract for the
$325,000 Fannie Edsel Falk Ele-
mentary school to be conducted in
conjunction with the school of Edu-
cation of the University will be let
early this spring, according to an
announcement made this week by
John Weber, University business
manager.

Construction work on the new
building, which will be erected on
University drive, near Center ave-
nue, will probably be started before
the close of the present school year.
The school which will serve as a
model school for children of kinder-
garten age will be of colonial archi-
tecture with many innovations in
design. Included among the fea-
tures of the building will be a high
gabled roof, sun porches, play
rooms and an auditorium. The build-
ing will be two stories high with di-
mensions of 100 feet by 50 feet.

A gift of $325,000 for the school
was made to the University last
spring by Leon Falk, Jr., and his
sister, Mrs. Marjorie Falk Levy, in
memory of their mother, Fannie
Edsel Falk, for whom the school
will be named. ‘

The new elementary school places
the teacher training equipment of
the University school of education
on a level with the best of the coun-
try. The new building will contain
a nursery school, a kindergarten and
an elementary school.

Purposes of the school will be to
furnish ajlaboratory in which pro-
gressive methods of education may
be discovered and tested; to serve
as a center for the dissemination of
the best methods of teaching in the
elementary school; to serve as a
model school wherein teachers in
training may observe expert teach-
ing, and. to maintain a school on
such a high level that the 200 pu-
pils admitted. to it will have-_ unsur-
passed education advantages. '

The agreement between the don-
ors and the University provides that
the University school is to absorb
the present community school sit-
uated on Wendover street, but that
as many directors of that school as
practicable be invited to serve as an
advisory committee to the school.

Debate Team
Ending Tour

Return Home After Debate
Against Indiana U.

SOUTH BEND, Ind., Feb. 12.——
(-Special.)—-The University of Pitts-
burgh team, coming near the end of
its western tour, will debate the
Notre Dame squad here tonight on
unemployment problems. The de-
bate which will be held in the uni-
versity auditorium is expected to at-
tract a large audience of students
and faculty members.

The Pitt debaters, Samuel
Strauss, Col. ’32; Cyril Jacobs, Bus.
Ad. ’32, and Richard Murphy, coach,
arrived here today from Iowa City
w-here Wednesday night the Univer-
sity of Iowa was met in a non-deci-
sion debate. .

The Pitt team will wind up its 4,-
000-mile trip tomorrow night at
Bloomington, InId., where the nega-
tive team of Indiana University is
to be encountered. The Pitt men
will return to Pittsburgh direct
from the Hoosier city.

Tuesday evening, Grinnell Col-
lege was met at Grinnell, Iowa,
where a large audiece heard the ar-
guments advanced on the prohibi-
tion question.

Thursday, Friday and Saturday
of last week were spent touring
South Dakota, where South Dakota
Teachers’ College, South Dakota
State College, and the University of
South Dakota were met on succes-
sive days.

At Brookings, S. D., the seat of
South Dakota State College, it was
found that the populace believed
strongly in prohibition. Before the
debate, an audience vote totaled
ninety-one in favor to eighteen
against the eighteenth amendment.
After the debate, the count was
ninety-one in favor to twelve against.
According to the Pitt representa-
tives, six wets got disgusted and
went out to do something about it.

One of the largest audiences of
the entire trip was that which
turned out at the South Dakota
State Teachers’ College, with more
than 500 jamming the auditorium to
hear the arguments on the prohibi-
tion question.

LARGE AUDIENCE

Give Honorary Awards
To Five Noted Men,
LL.D. To Speaker

Earned degrees totaling the rec-
ord number of 181 were conferred
by Chancellor John G. Bowman, at
the annual February convocation,
Wednesday morning, before a large
audience of parents and friends and
administrative officials, faculty and
students, in Syria Mosque. Five
honorary degrees were also awarded
at the impressive exercises.

“Even a university cannot guar-
antee an education; it cannot force
learning upon those who are not
receptive. It simply affords stu-
dents the opportunity to acquire

knowledge,” John M. Fitzgerald,
commencement speaker, told the
mid-year graduates.

Broad Vision

“A broad vision and definite
knowledge of actual facts,” he said,
“are not only desirable, they are ac-
tually necessary to an assured po-
sition in our industrial life. But
education is not the sole requisite
for success. There must also be a
willingness to do hard work. Re-
liability, dependability, loyalty and
honesty are likewise essential to
those who would make p-rogresss.

“The American people are born
optimists but are prone to disclaim
all personal responsibility for situa-
tions which are not to our liking.

“We regard business depression
as a sure sign of industrial decay.
Actually -it may constitute only an
occasional attack of growing pains.
We forget that the law of economies
is invincible and that sentiment has
never provena satisfactory substi-
tute for good judgment.

“The world continues to think
more and more about the real worth
of men and less regarding their

Seek Bread-Line In Vain

Pittsburgh Debaters, In Quest Of First-Hand

Experience, Amazed Omaha

    

-——Couresy Omaha World Herald.
Left to right, Samuel Strauss, Prof. Richard Murphy, (coach), and

Cyril J aco-bs‘.

Edz'tor’s note——This article is
reprinted from the February 9
issue of the Omaha World Her-
old of Omaha, Nebraska.

Absence of bread lines in Oma-
ha surprised the University of
Pittsburgh debating team members
who met the Creighton squad‘ at the
Knights of Columbus auditorium on
the question of compulsory , unem-

ployment insurance.
After witnessing long lines of

men waiting for free food in Pitts-
burgh, Detroit, Chicago, Minne-
apolis and Milwaukee, they came to
Omaha. To prove to Pittsburgh
people that they were getting their
unemployment impressions ﬁrst
hand, they went to the Omaha Sal-
vation Army headquarters prepared
to be photographed standing in a
bread line. They failed to ﬁnd the
bread line and were informed that
while men were being fed in the
soup kitchen as in former years,
they would have a difficult time lo-
cating what is popularly known as
a “bread line.” ‘

They said they were not only
pleased to ﬁnd that Omaha had no
“line," but that the people here
semed proud of the fact.

Urge Unemployment Insurance

In their advocacy of general un-
employment insurance, the Pitts-
burgh debaters point out that one
of its principal beneﬁts would be to
hold up the buying power of the
people and their willingness to spend
during a threatened depression.

“Even if a man hasn’t been
thrown out of work,” Strauss said,
“if he feels there is danger of los-
ing his job and having his income
cut off, he will curtail his buying at
the ﬁrst sign of a business slump.

/\

The feeling of security that insur-
ance would give would undoubtedly
have a marked psychological effect
on a nation-wide scale in preventing
a buyers’ panic.”

Jacobs quoted Royal Meeker, chief
of the United States bureau of la-
bor statistics, as saying that if this
-general plan would cost one-half bil-
lion dollars yearly, it would be
worth it to the country.

European plans of unemployment
insurance have been largely “sys-
tematized doles,” in the opinion of
the Pitt men. Their contention is
that the United States can work
out a plan whereby industry will
build up reserves to tide over slack
periods which would tend to short-
en these periods and thereby large-
ly eliminate causes which lead to the
demand for the dole.

Now That We Know Why
The 13th Is Unlucky
Let’: Not Worry

Sunny Weslager, Weekly col-
umnist, explains Friday, the
13th.

 

Before the Civil War the chil-
dren would gather at my knees,
and I would tell them stories.
Now they gather at my knee,
but I still tell the little precious
stories. Either they clamour for
a song about Sunny Buoy or
they want to know why Friday
the 13th is unlucky. The latter
I answer thusly:

Robinson Caruso awoke one
morning on his desert isle to
find his man Friday looking at
the calendar. “What day is to-
day, Friday,” he asked.

“Friday,” answered Friday.

“Friday?” asked Robinson.

“Friday,” said Friday.

“Good, Friday,” said Caruso,
“Next, Friday, we willprepare
for sailing next Friday, and
last, Friday, but not least, re-
member last Friday, I asked
you to prepare for this, Friday,
this Friday.” And he pointed to
the thirteen stars standing for
the original colonies.

Thus it is that Friday the
13th is considered unlucky.

Approve Plan
For Pitt Day

Council Approves May 1 For
General Holiday

 

 

The end of Senior week, leaving
to that period only such events
which are held exclusively for mem-
bers of the spring graduating class,

and the substitution of a “Pitt Day”\

on Friday, May 1, were forecast this
week by action of Student Council.
In special session Tuesday after-
noon, the governing group accepted
the offer of the administration to
gnant a general holiday on May 1,
at which time those Senior week
events in which all students of the
University may pairticipate, will be
staged.
. Among the events planned for
this day are Parade of the Pan-
therettes, " interrfraternity sweep-
stakes, tapping exercises and the
annual University dance. .

Council also decided Tuesday . to
appoint three chairmen who will
be in charge of the spring events.
A general chairman, who will be
in charge of events both on May 1
and those affairs that will continue
to be held in the week preceding
June graduartzion will be_ the most
importa.-nt«po.st to ﬁll. A chairman
of the Senior Ball, scheduled for
June 5, and a oo-chairman selected
from among the coeds to assist in
arranging events for women, will
also be named. These offices will
be ﬁlled from among applicants pre-
senrting petitions to Council at a
time to be announced by the gov-
erning group within the next
month.

No Football Holiday

In accepting the May holiday,
Council also agreed to give up any
football holiday next fall, when it
was pointed out that that day had
been meaningless in the past with
no planned celebration.

Events for the May day holiday
are to be partially ﬁnanced from
funds held by the graduating class
with additional am-ounts. being sub-
sc-ri-bed b organizations taking part
in the ce ebration. .

Granting of the holiday is an out-
come of a proposal made to Coun-
cil last fall by a group of interested
Seniors, who sought to advance cer-
tain Senior week events in order to

obtain a better attendance and

-awaken more interest.

According to Charles Seidle, Col.
’31, chairman of Student Relations
committee, who engineered the pro-
posal through Council channels, the
spring wlebration "will probably
start with a stunt night on Thurs-
day, April 30. On May 1, school
will be convened until 10:30»o’clock,
at which time tapping exercises will
be held in Memorial Hall. The af-
ternoon will be devoted to frater-
nity sweepstakes, the annual coed
parade and other events yet to be
scheduled. The University dance
will be held Friday evening.

Track meets will be held through-
out Saturday with fraternities stag-
ing their annual farewell dances
Saturday night to end the celebra-
tion of the week-end.

a Roman nose and a wicked leer.

The cast is unique in that it in- '

eludes four freshmen —- Herbert
Fine, Mines, ’34; Ruth Drum, Col.
’34; Carl Swartz, Col. ’34, and Elaine
Blauvelt, Col. ’34. ’

the-r members of the cast are
Mary Agnes Vichestain, Col. ’31, who
plays the part of a very sophisti-
cated and bored matron; Roy A.
Magran, Col. ’32, and George Tay-
lor, Dent. ’31, who in the’play is a
clever real estate agent.

The technical staff under the
management of Robert Seidle, I. E.,
’31, has been busy building the sets
for the pirate mess-hall and the
library of John Applcjohn’s quiet
country home. Temporarily the
staff has become interested in nau-
tical affairs so that the pirate vessel
may be a perfect background for
the renegades who will take posses-
sion of it next Thursday evening.

Ticket sellers will be on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor hall of Alumni every hour next
week and the players are planning
for a capacity crowd. ‘If you ever

here is your opportunity to gratify

“Tim” Lawry going into the fray
shortly after the game started,
tumedouttobetherealstarof
the evening, by making the most
spectacular shot ever seen here, a
most impossible side shot. The ball
hit the side of the rim and bounded
high in the air and came down si-
multaneously as the gun went off
to go through the basket and score
the necessary two points, tying the
score 30 to 30. Art the start of the
ﬁve-minute overtime ‘period he was
the first to make a basket scoring’
with another beautiful corner shot,
giving the Panthers a lead which
they kept during the remainder of
the game. _

“Willie” Kowallis played a great
game at the other forward position.
He was always there with a basket
when the Blue and Gold needed it
most. He ended up as high scorer,
making a. total of 16 points.

The game was one of the most
exciting and fastest contests that
has been witnessed here this sea-

son.
The visitors’ scoring was led by
Norb Crowe, who totaled 12 points.

House, with three prominent speak- _

e_rs on the four-day program.

Both of these groups are spon- 
soring the series of conferences and _

assemblies in an attempt to help

students understand major social is-‘ 2;
sues they will have to face in later 55'

life, and to aid them in developing
the best attitudes with which to
meet those issues. That is the pur-
pose of the campus “Y” pro pm,
as expressed by W. W. Mendenhall,
executive secretary of the Univer-
sity Y. M. C. A.

he principal speakers will be -J.

sentatives to approval of the mo-
tion giving the Fraternity Commit-
tee enforcement powers over the
C~oun:ci1 rules. -

Those opposed to this arran
ment held that the real purpose of
Interfraternity Council was being
defeated and that both legislative
and judicial powers should rest with
the members themselves. Brought
to a vote the count was fourteen
to ﬁve in favor of the motion giving
the right of enforcement to the Fra-
ternity Comniittee of the Univer-
sia y.

President Pry was instructed to
appoint a committee to meet with
W. W. Mendenhall, Y. M. C. A. sec-
retary and Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant to the dean of men, to dis-
cuss plans for a general pledge
banquet to be held within the next
month. ‘

The president was also instructed
to appoint a committee to consider
plans relative to establishment of an
Interfratermty Council room on the
Men’s ﬂoor_ of the Cathedral of
Learning. ' Interfraternity Council
has a., fund of approximately $400
to be used in furnishing this room.

A brief discussiotm was also held
on the. feasibility of holdin-g. an in-
terfratennity conclave on "th.e‘"’P1'»tt
campus; at which heads of national
fraternities would present ad-
dresses. -

The lack of events on this week-end’s Social Memo merely adds to

‘die

College Set’s anticipatory mood for coming festivities. Every day

now some new delight is being added to make this year’s Junior Prom an
unparalleled success. The comm_1ttee_under the chairmanship of Richard
Phifer promises Opie Cate’s “Californians,” unique decorations, something

different in entertainment, and unusual favors.

Don’t forget——an excep-

Harvard Man

Sigma. Xi Sponsors Lecture
On Stellar World

 

Dr. Harlow Sha-pley, Paine pro-
fessor of Astronomy at Harvard
University, delivered the ﬁrst pub-
lic lecture given under the auspices
of the newly created Pitt chapter of
the Society of the Sigma Xi, Wed-
Lieslday evening in Carnegie Lecture

at ..
Dr. Shapley gave an illustrated
lecture on “New Explorations in
the Stellar World.” His lecture, al-
though concerned with subject mat-
ter of perhaps the most confusing
branch of scientiﬁc investigation,
was delivered in terms that made it
comprehensible as well as interest-
ing to both layman and scientist.

He covered eight “stages in ga-
lactic explorations,” from the com-
paratively minor solar system in
which our own earth and sun are
located, to the great ga1a:."c,.- cf the

One aspect of the great magni-
tude of ‘the unexplored heavens, Dr.
Shapley pointed out on one particu-
llu-‘photograph which plainly showed
an uneven distribution of matter, in
the-form of stars. This might br-
taken as an argument against such
concepts of ‘the ﬁniteness of the uni-
verseas‘ Einstein’s theory of “rela-
tivity,” because of the fact that
such theories are dependent upon

. the uniform distribution of matter.

Matter in the universe, said Dr.
Sha ley, is not uniformly distrib-
ute , as a study of the heavens will
reveal.

Th rough 30-Inch Thaw Refractor

By DR. FRANK 0. JORDAN.
Director Allegheny Observatory
The Allegheny Observatory, the

astronomical department of the Uni-
versity, is one of the outstanding
observatories of the world, both in
its equipment and in the amount
and quality of work turned out.‘ The
principal instrumentof research is
the 30-inch Thaw Refractor, the
best photographic refractor in the
world.

Two large programs of work are
being carried on with this instru-
ment: Stellar Parallax and Stellar
Photometry by the extra-focal meth-
od. Since the telescope was in-
stalled in 1914, more than 43,000
plates have been obtained, 85 per
cent of which are for parallax_de-
terrninations. From ﬁfteen to thirty
plates are obtained for each star,
and in the case of some of them
the observations have been scat-
tered over a period of ten years;
never less than three, so _the work
is rather slow. Observations have
been completed for approximately
1,250 stars, of which about 950 have
been measured. The results ob-
tained are more accurate than those
found at any other observatory in
the world. About 300 stars will
await measurement, and 300 others
are partly observed. The telescope
is being used every clear night for
the accumulation of plates, while
efforts are being concentrated on
measuring the accumulated arrears
of parallax plates.

Publish Volumes

In the Photometric program, work
, I.-5 ooing carried on just as vigorous-
il;~'. One result of this is the pub-
§l‘u:-.-.t1on of a complete volume of
 he Publications of the Allegheny
().;:.crva.-tory” containing the light
;«;uI'ves of 29 Cepheid and 16 eclips-

Ling variables. Other curves are
;l'r.‘a(ly for publication, and many

,other stars are under observation.
Since 1905, when work really be-
igan in the new observatory, seven
Evolumes have been issued and sev-
 eral sections of volume 8 have been
‘published. Enough material ison
hand for several other volumes,
which will be published as soon as
funds are available for the work.

Observations with the 30-inch are
now being made on the asteroid
Eros. This is done in co-operation
with many other observatories of
the world in the problem of the de-
termination of a more accurate val-
ue of the distance of the Earth from
the Sun, the “Yard Stick of the
Universe.” Eros, on January 30,
was at a distance of only 16,000,000
miles from the earth, its nearest ap-
proach for forty years, and -
nearest any heavenly body exce t
the moon ever comes to the ca .
Measurement and discussion of the
plates obtained at the various ob-
servatories will lead to the required
result.

The Observatory has two other
instruments, a 13-inch refra-ctor,
and a 30-inch keﬂector. The former
is now used only for visitors, but
years ago in the hands of ‘ Keeler
and Langley it did notable work in
the study of planets and the sun.
The latter, before 1915, was used in
connection with a spectrograph for
the determination of the radial ve-
locities of stars. In this work, the
orbits of many spectographic bi-
naries were determined. It is now
being used by Dr. Kelvin Burns as
an auxiliary instrument in connec-
tion with an interferometer and a

bes the recent astronomical observations made at the Allegheny

large grating spectograph in the de-
termination of solar wave lengths.
The work here is e ual in accurac
to that done at t. Wilson wit
considerably larger and more elab-
orate equipment. Wave lengths are
determined with an accuracy of — one

art in 5,000,000 in the case of so-
l)r lines, and one part in 10,000,-
000 for laboratory determinations
of iron lines and of other metals
most prominent in the solar spec-
trum.

5,000 Visitors

The public service of the Observa-
tory gives admission to about 5,000
visitors per year. If the night is
clear they can look at various celes-
tial objects through the 13-inch tel-
escope; if cloudy they listen to an
illustrated astronomical lecture.
These parties are taken charge of
by‘ Mr. W. R. Ludewig, or occasion-
ally by members of the staff.

The publications of the observa-
tory are sent to observatories and
individuals throughout the world,
and their publications are received
in return. Many people of Pitts-
burgh hardly know of the existence

of the observatory, much less ofits

reputation and work, while astron-
omers from half-way around the
world make pilgrimages hero to in-
spect the observatory and become
familiar with its work.

FIRST of all, I’m going to tell
about a few of the things which I
saw down at Techbound Studio.
Here’s your idea for a novel bridge
prize, or birthday gift. A diary, or
small scrap book, bound in white
kid, with a hand painted design on
the cover, and a different ﬂoral de-
sign hand painted on every page;

with designs in hannonioiis‘ colors
painted on the ﬂaps which hold the
paper in place, and for a booby prize
nothing could be more acceptable
than a little kid-covered box of
matches, likewise decorated witR>a
delicate hand painted design. You
will ﬁnd nothing like these any place
in Pittsburgh.

AGAIN a word to those thrifty
people, who I suppose, will some day
be our ‘captains of industry.’ As
poor Richard said, “A penny saved
is a» penny earned.” The Oakland
branch of the Peoples Pittsburgh
Trust company, Forbes and Meyran,
will be glad to start an account with
you. And if you have a little “nest
egg” you will be agreeably surprised
when you ﬁnd you don't have to bor-
row money from the room mate to
go to your class dance.

DOESN’T it “get your goat” when
you lose some article of jewelry, of
rather small value, perhaps, but
something that you simply cannot
replace? And it will make you even
more annoyed after you learn that
such a loss could have been avoided
if you had taken the article down to
Rockney & Volmrich, Clark build-
ing, and had your name engraved on
it. They do good work, too, or they
_wouldn’t do the University engrav-
ing. .

MADE your date for St. Valen-
tine’s day yet? Remember what I
told you last week about going to
the Betsy Ross Tea Room, Forbes
and Oakland avenues?
peat it. Go to the Betsy Ross for
good food, good service, good com-
pany, good-—well, what’s the use of
repeating myself? Just go to the
Betsy Ross and see for yourself.

be exceptionally good news, if it is

Violate Exam. Honor
. Code; Get Probation

Stanford University, Palo Alto,
Cal'Lf.—Twenty-three members of a
language class were placed on hon-
orary probation by the men's and
women's councils recently, after
questioning of the class revealed vi-
olations of the honor code.

The six. other members of the
class were ﬁunked in the course and

also placed on probation by the
councils. The probationary period
for the entire group will remain in
force during the college career of
each member,» the councils ruled.
Under the provisions of the pro-
bation, the names of all the students
will be sent to the president of the

 

university and to the respective

deans‘ of future reference, Virgil
Dowell, chairman of men's council,
declared. . V

If any student of the class is sus-
pected of violating the code in the
future, the proper council will expel
the oifender from Stanford, he said.

In imposingvsentence the council
decided that each member of the
class, regardless of the actual guilt
of the students, was technically at
fault for failing to report the vio-
lations. “It is up to the class itself
to report cheating,” Dowell said in
reprimanding the assembled stu-
dents. “As it stands each student
will be under suspicion in all ex-
aminations.”

Owl Sorority Contest
Ends Next Friday

Although the__I9-31 Owl sorority
contest lagged during the rush of
examination and registration, it
took on new life yesterday at a
meeting of the contestants at the
Heinz House, when the contest man-
ager, Ben Weissman, Col. ’33, an-
nounced that the contest would close
at 4 o’clock next Friday afternoon.

Aspirited ﬁght is being waged by
the sororities for ﬁrst place and the
prize which goes to the winner.

Due to the steel etching view sec-
tion, four color division pages,
many pages of action snapshots of
students’ hall of fame, senior sec-
tion, and many other innovations,
the staff is enthusiastic over the
senior annual.

Under the direction of Wilfred
Berman, Bus. Ad. '31, pictures of
campus organizations are being
taken nightly in the locker rooms of
the stadium.

Roy Mag-ram, Col. ’32, in charge

Creates Furor

Campus Raves Over Tabloid
Style of Panther

 

 

A new note in journalism was
struck when on Monday, February
9, the tabloid issue of the Pitt Pan-
ther was put on" sale throughout, the
campus. Newspapermen scratched
their heads in bewilderment and
journalism classes ended in confu-
sion when the edition, appeared.

“Keyed_to‘the tempo of the great
American band wagons. . circulation
in the millions. -. .advertising for
mass appeal. . .sensations to jolt
jaded minds. . .stereotyped informa-
tion. . .wisecracks' for the kids and

for grandfather. . .romance and ad-
venture ground out. ,who‘lesale 'for

starved souls. . .bunk, but we give

the public _what it wants,” is the
way the editors of the tabloid issue

-of the Panther modestly explain it.

But there "is more to it than that.
Rollickingly funny as it is, it is also
a commetary on modern journalism
where news is not news unless it is
sensational.

Comment on the issue was as

plentiful and as good as were the

sales. At the Notre Dame basket-
ball game, where the issue wasﬁrst
sold, it ranked with Lawry's basket-
shooting as an attraction. The ex-
cellent parodies on various column-
ists and on current news stories
were found to be more interesting
than the works of which they had

been parodied. .

In the following article, H. N.
Swanson, editor of “College Hu-

aspect of college gradugtion. It

to women. Mr. Swanson is pinch-
hitting this week for “Sunny” Wes-
lager and his Pitt Pouri.

By II. N. SWANSON,

Editor “College Humor”

(lvritten Exclusively for Pitt Weekly)

Is there a life after adolescence?
What happens to the college gradu-
ate after he “stands face to face
with life,” as commencement speak-
ers would havp it? This is a ques-
tion far greater than the used-car
problem. Where do all the old col-
lege boys and girls go‘,‘and why do
they have such a low trade-in value?

In ﬁction, there is 'a gap here. Too
many bad novels; have been struck
off about nice young men who have
gone from school to the big city,
who.have starved and ﬁnally won
out in the accepted fashion, on_,the
very last page. But almost never are
the problems of the girl graduate
digniﬁed between the covers of a
book—_either a good or bad book.

One of the reasons. for *.h.isjis the
feeling that the college girl after
‘college is a very mild subjectfor
ﬁction, that any story having to do
with her success or failure i_s doomed
to suffer from the very-start from a
lack of reader interest.

Opportunities Galore

The_ girl ‘graduate could always re-
turn to the family fold, a‘ thing the
man was usually too proud to do.
She could get married, teach school.
But today's young lady is more dif-
ferent from her counterpart of
twenty years ago than is the man
graduate of 1930. The splendid vis-
tas of commercial achievement were
never more attractive; they balance
off the sweet ﬁres of love. . __

Many married girls ﬁnd, when the
tumult and orange blossoms have
died down, that love‘ is not enough.
Others are ﬁnding before marriage
that they cannot build their lives on
the affection of men. So business
claims them. If they are still un-
married when business success
comes, or they are married to men
less successful than themselves, it
means a long emotional struggle.
When a man finds his business suc-
cess, life for him becomes‘ more pat-
terned and less. complicated. But
when a girl achieves, she usually
discovers her -problems multiplied in-
stead of solved. ’

Needs Sheepskin

A diploma is almost standard
equipment for the young darling of
today. Any gir-l graduate faces the
cold fact that nine out of ten of’ her
number are doomed to failure in the
business world. By that I mean they
are going to miss business success.
Not only does the girl graduate have
to compete with the college-trained
man of her age, but she. must ﬁght
the girl who never went to school
‘and who has, usually, sharpened her-
self by reason of the struggle she
has had to meet from the begin-
ning.

Perhaps I sound too pessimistic.
I don’t mean to be that. The girl
graduate of today is free to do as
she pleases wtih her future, is ready
to be stimulated by success. She can
thank her lucky stars that she is

h

years ago. The going may be hard,
but the rewards are proportionately
greater. ’ '

Expert Tells
Of Art Vision

Coeds Learn How to Enjoy
Principles of Painting

 

“One must get into the habit of
looking more intently at; paintings
in order to better understand them,”

said Miss Elizabeth Rothwell of
the Frick Training School, in speak-
ing to the art group of Y. W. C. A.
on some principles of understand-
ing paintings, Tuesday afternoon, in
Heinz House. “Too often the indi-
vidual merely glances at a picture
and then passes 'it.up without dis-
covering the minute details the art-
ist. has used which add greatly to
the meaning of the painting.

“The artist’s entire life is one of
vision,” stated Miss Rothwell..“The
ordinary individual looksat things
from acommonplace viewpoint; the
artist looks for the new and unusu-
al -in everything.” However, the
object of the artist’s work may not
be representatives, forit may be
what he imagines.

The ﬁrst law of the artist is the
law of the interaction of the real
man to the view. His greatest dif-
ﬁculty is concerned in holding this
aesthetic reaction all the time he is
at work on his painting. No "mat-
ter what the ‘public opinion of a
painting may be, each picture is 8.
harmonious piece -of beauty from an
aesthetic standpoint‘.

In closing, Miss Rothwell. ex-
plained that a., painting never
changes, but through a change in

an individual it is possible for him~

to grasp the artist’s idea at one
time or another. She left with the
women the advice to attempt to see
every detail of a picture and in this
way to gain aesthetic experience be-
yond the mere painting they see be-
fore them.

After Miss Rothwell’s talk, tea
was served to the group, Mrs. C. V.
Starrett pouring.

Sleep Expert, Gives
Talk on Discoveries

“Sleeping Like a Child,” Dr. H.
M. Johnson's illustrated lecture,
held the interest of a large attend-
ance at the Woman's Association
meeting Wednesday afternoon, Feb-
ruary 11, at the University Club.

Dr. Johnson, who is head of the
Simmons Investigation of Sleepiat
Mellon Institute, has gained a na-
tional reputation as a psychologist
on fatigue and sleep. By bisex-
perimenuts and observations upon
the sleep of children, he has dis-
proveda large number of old the-
ories on this favorite pastime. 6

One of the discoveries Dr. John-
son has made is that-there is no one
good position in which to sleep.. He
claims that the best position is the
one most comfortable to the ‘indi-
vidual. He also expressed disbelief
in the idea that deformities may be
caused by children sleeping in an im-
proper position. As the basis,’ of
this theory, he has numerous ob-
servations which he has made of
children while they were slumber-
mg. .

Cridders Meet
Dukes In 1932

Clash In Stadium To Mark
New Era In City Sports

The clashin of the Pitt-Duquesne
football squa s in 1932 will mark
the beginning ‘of a new era. in Pitts-
burgh sports. For several years
sports critics and followers have
urged‘ that Duquesne be added to
the Pittsburgh duet. The game will
be played in the Pitt stadium.

Plans for such a game were com-
pleted this week b W. Don Harri-
son, director of ath etics at Pitt, and
John Holohan, graduate manager at
Duquesne, and Elmer Layden,
Duquesne’s head football coach and
athletic council chairman. The
agreement calls for the game to be
played on some date suitable to both
teams, probably either October 22
or 29, 1932. The contract will
probably be extended for several
years, despite the fact that it has
been made for only one year.

Begin Negotiations

" Three months ago negotiations ‘for
the game were begun. At ﬁrst, Har-
rison, with the consent of the Pitt
athletic council, attempted to ar-
range a game for 1931. However,
there were no open dates on the
Duke’s card. and it was impossible
to get a date suitable to both teams.

Last week, the subject of the
game was discussed once more by
Harrison and Holohan, and this
time deﬁnite plans were made. A
contract was drawn" up and then
sent to the authorities of Duquesne.
The necessary approval was given,
and it was signed by Rev. Joseph
J. Callahan, president of Duquesne,
and by Director Layden.

Terms Announced

By the terms of the contract, both
teams are to begin practice at the
same time; and the Dukes are not
to schedule any other opponent that
Pitt" is to meet that fall.

Head Football Coach and Direc-
tor Layden was delighted with the
agreement. He said: “I am de-
lighted to have a chance to play
Jock Sutherland’s team, since his
teams always display the ﬁnest
sportsmanship. We have always
tried to do the same, and I expect
the game in 1932 to ‘be an excel-
lent one. Everything points to 9.

r

4 ﬁne game and a ﬁne rivalry between

Pitt and Duquesne, and we would
be highly pleased if this game would
be followed by others. .

Independent League
Dissolution Probable

The sponsors of the Independent
Basketball League have been forced
to consider dissolving that league
as its members have failed to ap-
pear for the scheduled games. There
hasnot been a game played during
the past two weeks.

Early interest shown by the
members of the league soon waned.
and of late few of the members
came to tm floor with a full squad.
This had been the main cause of the
present situation which has cast
the purpose of the originators of
the league into the discard.

Although entirely unlikely, it is
still believed that the backers will
present the winners with the awards
which were announced at the begin-
ning of the season. Should the re-
maining games be playedgoﬁ, there
is no doubt but that the awards will
-be made. ‘ -

“Faculti In llniversitate”
Issue Bowlers challenge

Students may be smarter than the
members of the Pitt faculty and
they also may be better bowlers, but
the members of the Pitt faculty
doubt the veracity of the latter as-
sumption even though they will
readily admit that of the former
statement.

The boys who come in for curses
when the “blue prints” are passed
around at the end of each semester,
have been lookin on during the
course of the inte raternity bowling
tournament and laughing up their
sleeves art the efforts of the intel-
lectual element of the Un-iversiity
to roll the big ball down the alley
in an eifort to knock the pins “oﬂi
their ‘pins.’ ”

The Phi Beta Kappa boys have

laughed at . our stories in the
Weekly which infer that the cham-
pions of the Greek league will be
c ro wne d University champions.
“You may know how to predict foot-
ball scores,” they say to me with a
sarcastic tone. in their voice, “But
you don’t know a good bowler when
you see one."
. We laughed at these remarks, but
ever mindful of the fact that I in-
tend to take a course in accounting
next semester, I consented to give
Carl F. Distelhorst, professor of ac-
counting in the school of Business
Administration and also captain of
the faculty bowling team, a break
on this page. '

The good professor takes advan-
tage of the graciousness of the
Weekly sports staﬂ’ to issue a chal-
lenge to the team which wins the

ship, the ﬁnals of which were held

' Captain Distelhorst has- an»-

reserves the right to change said
lineup before the match is rolled.
In addition to D-isty, other members
of the faculty who have signiﬁed

against the students, are as follows:

Theodore Biddle, assistant to the
dean of men, secretary and scorer
of said team; Dr. Jules LaBarthe,
who is now engaged ‘in special re-

Walter G. Rome, graduate manager
of no-n-student activities, and John

The manager of the winning fra-

faculty who think that they cam
beat any of the men who have been
temporarily placed in the lineup are
requested to call Mr. Distelhorst at
Room 1, State Hall.

“Le capita_ine” says that he can
be found there at almost any time

PittiLucky,
Keogan Says

Work of Doc Kowallis Praised
By Irish Basketball Coach

 

 

.“Pr-e-t-ty lucky!” was the grum-
bling reply this young journalist
got from Coach Keogan at the P.
and L. E. station last Saturday
night after the Pitt-Notre Dame

game. '

Commenting further, about the
game, Keogen said: “Those two
shots in the last twenty seconds by
Timmy Lawry were Just thrown
blindly, and as far as I can see
it, Lawry .must have had a four-
leaf clover with him, because I've
seen plenty of basketball in my
time and have never seen any shots
pulled like those.”.

“Did you think the shot that tied
up the game was legitimate?" was
the next query. “Yes,” answered
the Notre Dame mentor. “But it
seemed to ‘me that I heard some-
body yell to the timekeeper to shoot
ﬁéteen seconds before the gun went
0 .’

The Irish coach then went into
details about his team failing to
freeze the ball with the game so far
gone. “If the boys would have held
onto the ball "instead of trying to
score any more, we'd be going home
on thelong end of the score. And
if the team wouldn't have missed
those set-ups when they werettrying
to score, the game would have end-
ed otherwise. But what’: the use of
if-ing.” ‘

Asked whom he thought played
the best game for the Pitt team, Keo-
gan answered, “Kowallis.” That
boy never got excited, kept scoring
baskets, and played a whale of a
ﬂoor game. Here, Baldwin, the
oung fellow who guarded “Docky,”
interrupted with the remark, “I did
not’ mind Kowallis scoring, but the
way he came back to his position
without saying a word and with a
frozen look on his face was what
jarred me.”

In closing the interview granted
to this young reporter and dashing
for his train at the same time,
Coach Keogan yelled, “We’ll get
them next year and give them a|
good beating.”

seven of last year’s letter winners!
in an effort to bring back to Pitts-
burgh the Army scalp. Let by co-
Captains Strother, a center,. and
Kreuger, a forward, the Army team
is determined to avert another de-
feat such as was handed them last
Saturday by Columbia, and to start
a. new winning streak, the ﬁrst -one
having extended through nine games
before being snapped by Colunrbiia.

With the Army boasting of a vet- .

eran team composed of last Year’:
letter men, the Pitt team will have
8- hard time bringing a victory home.
Albright, Pit7t’s varsity center," will

have his hands full in curtailing the A

scoring proclivities of co-Captain

Strother who has been one of the I

leading scorers of the Army team
for three years. Messinger, the
hefty Army football man, will take
care of one guard position. 00-
Captain Kreuger. along with Stroeh-"
er, has been a potent factor in Army
victories for three years.

The Army team is set for a_gal_-
lant effort to avenge last year’s "de-
feat of 39-25. The game at. West
Point tomorrow will in all probatgbll-I
ity have a great deal to do with the-
naming of the Eastern basketball
champion. Army with only one loss
to an Eastern rival and Pitt withno

Eastern defeats are certainly two

Naturally, this distributing organization

the game. He thinks that the “Night Riders” will outdraw Syracuse
and Nebraska, two class A teams which have appeared here at various
times, and other district class B teams. ‘
Personally, I do not share “Murph’s” enthusiasm. While it is true
that Duquesne has been advancing in the quality of its football teams
during the past few years, it loses most of its regulars through gradua-

Duquesne’s football machines during the last four years, __and Coach

on the down grade, she will ﬁnd it exceedingly difficult to retrace her
steps back to the top. Football is assuming a more and more important
part in the life of college students; and with the competition between
schools for star high and prep school athletes assuming bigger propor-
tions almost daily, Duquesne will ﬁnd numerous obstacles in its path
to build another team of class A calibre.

Of course, there is the possibility that the Dukes might surprise
Pitt just as Carnegie Tech did a few years ago when she registered her
ﬁrst victory over Pitt; but Coach Sutherland and those intimately con-
nected in Pitt athletics will probably guard against such an occurrence.

I feel sure that the friends and alumni of both schools as well as
the sporting public of Pittsburgh are now looking forward to that in-
augural battle, which I hope will cement permanently cordial athletic

relations between our two schools.

Sincerely yours,

tween the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne Univerisity, _the
Editor of the Duke was requested to give to the Weekly his opinions
The following is the letter which we received:

In answer to your request for ‘my personal reaction to the scheduling
of Duquesne by the University of Pittsburgh, I can honestly say that
such a step seemed but inevitable under all the circumstances. Of course
I -had not anticipated that such athletic relations would be assumed in
the immediate future. Certainly it will be a good thing for both schools
and will add conisiderable spice to the football season in this city.

No doubt \the question of gate receipts was a factor that entered
into the discussion. There is every reason to believe that Duquesne will
outdraw teams like Waynesburg, Western Reserve, Syracuse and Nebraska,
all of wh-om were on Pi.tt’s schedule last year.

of the most noted baskietbagll play-
ers in the co-uinitry, the C. C. N. Y.
team has made an enviable record
of eight victories and three defeats.
After winning eighrt straight_ games,

three conﬂicts.
their victims are Dartmouth, Temple,

With two veteirains of last year’s

well fortiﬁe-d with last year’s frosh

in the lineup of the present team are
De Phillips, captain and‘ center, and
Tr-upin, the high scorer of last

With Tim Lawry and Doc Kowa.l-

hopes of adding two more victims to

J ohnstown College
Rates Among Highest

The Johnstown Junior College of
the University ranks in the upper
sixth in enrollment among all the
junior colleges of the United States
and Canada, according to a recent
survey. A

The total enrollment at the Johns-
town Center for the ﬁrst semester
was 856, with 208 full-time students
and 648 special or part—time stu-
dents. '
In the recent survey of junior col-
leges in America, conducted by Dr.
Doak S. Campbell, secretary of the
American Association of Junior Col-
leges, statistics for 429 institutions
were compiled. Of these, only sixty-
five have enrollments comparable to
or greater than the Johnstown Jun-
ior College. The enrollment of

the Johnstown institution is greater
than the entire junior college en-
rollment in nine states that have

Varsity Wins Opening Dual
Meet With Wooster

Tonight the Pift varsity swimmers
are in Cleveland,to meet Case. The
men are all in good shape and an-
other victory is expected. On Sat-
urday Pat Corr sends one of the
strongest teams in this district to
the Pittsburgh Natatorium to com-
pete in the A. M. A. meet. Under
Corr’s rigorous training, a strong
team has been developed which
should have little trouble in win-
ning the high point trophy.

Wooldridge is expected to come
through in the 150-yard back stroke
A. M. A. championship. Hanna and
Cogswell are entered in the 220-yard
free style events and their chances
of winning are good. Reilly should
win theaopen 60-yard free style event
and Larimer is a good bet in the
novice race. Carik and Schmieler
will compete for diving honors.-

Beat Wooster

Saturday, February 7, the varsity
team opened the swimming season
by defeating Wooster College at the
Keystone Athletic Club to the tune
of 60 to 15. The Pitt boys won all
ﬁrst places and all but one second
place. Captain Fred Wooldridge
was the star performer for the var-
sity, having ﬁrsts in the 50 and 100-
yard free style events and swimming
on the winning relay team. .

At the same time the freshman
team beat Kiski Prep school 38 to
21, winning 6 ﬁrst places out of a

possible 7. Norton and Adlersberg
were the distinguished frosh
splasheirs.

“After

1 “Wonder who the Pepper Prize
gwinner will be” is rather a com-
3mon conjecture about this time of
,the year, but “Wonder what the
lPepper Prize winners are doing
inow” is clouded in almost as deep
fmystery. Answering the second con-
’ jecture is where the young reporter
‘makes his debut.

Laurence I. Klinestiver, Bus. Ad.
’22, was the first University of
Pittsburgh student to be awarded
the prize. After graduation he
worked for several years before en-
rolling in the Western Reserve Law
:School, Cleveland, from which he
was graduated in 1930. He is now
practicing law in the Buckeye state.

From Diamond to Bar

Another member of the School of
Business Administration who later
took up law was Ira (more com-
monly known as ' “Lefty”) Hill,
_prize winner in 1924. At present
he belongs to a ﬁrm of Pitt.law-
yers who have their offices in the
Grant building. Incidentally, “Lef-
ty” isia member of the Alumni Coun-
cil, numbering eighty members in
all, which is a great honor for any
graduate. If you’re still curious to
have the “Lefty” explained, Mr.
Hill was an active ﬁrst baseman
and pitcher during his college ca-
reer. -

Three more of our outstanding
men came from the Business Ad-
ministration ranks: J. Clyde Bar-
ton of the Class of ’26, who re-
sides in Wilkinsburg and is ﬁeld
manager of the Bundy Steam Com-
pany, Pittsburgh; Charles R. Wil-

Kowallis In Gliarge of
Varsily Team

George Kowallis, Pitt fresh-'
man basketball coach who was
in charge of the Pitt varsity
team when it met Wash-Jeff
last week, will direct the Pan-
thers on their Eastern invasion,
as Doc Carlson, -varsity coach,
is still bothered with eye trouble
and will be unable to make the
trip to West Point and New
York City.

It is not yet certain who will
be in charge of the freshman
basketball team tomorrow eve-
ning when it meets the Union-
town Junior college on the lat-
ter’s ﬂoor.

Cub Cagemen Meet
Uniontown Juniors

Minus the guidance of their coach
and captain, the Pitt freshman
cage team will play a return game
with the U-nivonto-wn Junior College

ter’.s homeﬂoor.

Coach Kowallis will be with the

varsity team tomorrow night while
Captain Doc Macamant is ill. It is
possible that “Whitey” Hagan will
act in the capacity of the coach
with Russ O«c.hs.enihirt acting as cap-
tain as he has done in most of the
freshies’ games‘ this season.
. The freshmen won the first game
played between the two teams three
weeks ago by a 29-14 score, and
they will hardly be pressed to ﬁn-
ish on the long end of the score
tomorrow night.

They won their second game in a
row over the Kiski prep school lads,
conquerors of the Carnegie 'I‘ec=h
freshmen and of St. Vincent’s col-
lege team, last Saturday. The score
of this struggle was 28-22.

Pitt ‘had a hard time getting
started and did not register a ﬁeld
goal until late in the third period
when Ochseenihirt scored three in
succe=ssi»on to send the young Pan-
thers ahead. The elongated Dutch-A
man was again the high scorer, as
he scored ﬁve fouls out of six at-
tempts to total eleven points for the
evening’s work.

number of Pepper Prize winners in
the School of Business Administra-

Charles R. Foster, Jr., ’23, was
the College’s only bid for fame in
this line. Mr. Foster is now doing
educational work in Newark, N. J.,
and also holds an assistant profes-
sorship in Rutgers College.

Just One Coed!

Since Pitt is a co-educational
school it is only fair that the wom-
en should have a show in the list
of illustrious alumni. Anna B.
Schaab, Ed. ’25, is the only woman
recipient of the George Wharton
Pepper Prize. Miss Schaab, though,
is no longer Miss Schaab, but is
known as Mr. Andrew B. Robb, for
she has been married for several
years and is the mother of a baby
boy. She lives in Mt. Lebanon.

Henry D. Cossitt who received his
A. B. from Michigan in'1923“ and
was a member of the graduating
class of the School of Dentistry at
Pitt in 1929 is now practicing den-
tistry in the Nicholas building, To-
ledo, Ohio. If you ever have a tooth-
ache while you’re in Toledo, you'll
know Where to go.

Viers Adams, Ed. ’30, completes
the list up to the presentitime. He
is now assistant to the head at the
Johnstown Center of the University
of Pittsburgh. '

Elm Shade Tree: Will Be
Placed on F rick Acres

 

Mr. R. E. Griswold of Pittsburgh
has been engaged by the University
as consulting landscape architect for
the grounds around the Cathedral
of Learning. A force of men are
busy leveling and grading the land
at present, preparing it for plant-
ing of shrubbery, trees, and grass.

According to present plans, four
large elm trees will be purchased
and transplanted on Frick Acres..
One will be planted at the corner of
Forbes street and Bigelow boule-
vard, another at the corner of Fifth
avenue and Bigelow boulevard, and
the. remaining two will be plantedto _
match the pair that shade the Boule- ‘
vard about a third of the block’s
length from the Fifth avenue corner.

It is planned to have a. curving
driveway for the Cathedral pass be-
tween these two pairs of majestic
trees. Two of the elms will be
brought from Zelienople, Pennsyl-
vania, and two from Steubenville,
Ohio. Their trunks will have a di-
amter of 18 inches. .

In addition, four Norway maples,
