Obama, lVlcCain HQS gearing up  

by Dan Vetanovetz
Staﬂ IV/‘its/' ‘

With Sen. John McCain’s of-
fices already opened in Pitts-
burgh, Sen. Barack Obama’s
presidential campaign expand-
ed its efforts this month. The
Democrat’s office in Pittsburgh

opened its doors to ‘the public on _

Aug. 7 during a grand opening
Downtown. 3

Though the campaign’s Pitts-

burgh headquarters were for— _

merly located in East Liberty, the
campaign took the opportunity

to move into a spacious‘ office

complex at 213 Smithﬁeld St. af-

ter Sen. Hillary Clinton’s primary

presidential campaign vacated’

the building. ‘
“It’s a more central location,”
said former intern Roy Carlson,
a senior studying political science
at Duquesne University. A
The grand opening was part
of a statewide kickoff that had
every major Obama campaign
office celebrating. On Smithﬁeld
‘Street, blank white rooms were

organized primarily according
to voting wards. There were also
rooms that partially represented
nearby neighborhoods such as
Oakmont.

Volunteers and staff members
from their respective locations
worked in the office to sign up
volunteers, and discuss Obama’s
presidential campaign. Although
Carlson said the campaignofﬁce
has been open for approximately
two weeks, much of that_ time
has been spent setting up the of
ﬁce for business. '

 

At iOba.ma’s opening event,
campaign support materials were
available for free for supporters.

At the opening, assembled
spectators crammed into a cen-

tral room and fanned themselves -

- to ﬁght off the heat while they

listened to speeches. Speakers at
the opening included Allegheny
County Democratic Party chair
James Burn Jr. and former City
Council member Sala Udin.

Burn emphasized unity be-
tween Obama’s and Clinton’s
supporters in the face of McCa-
in’s opposition for the presiden-
tial office, which Burn strongly
criticized.

“They are still trying to rub
salt in our wounds,” said Burn of
the Republicans’ campaign. Ac-
knowledging the sharp words be-
tween the two Democratic con-
tenders, Burn said, “That was not
a ﬁght, that was a debate,” during
the primary campaign season: A

Udin chose to emphasize
what he saw as supporters taking
McCain’s defeat for granted. V

McCain’s local campaign of-
ﬁces are located in Greentree. Al-
though the office did not return
calls, Pitt’s chapter of the College

NCAA denies appeal

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta E3itor

After months of waiting,
ex—Pitt basketball player Mike
Cook’s appeal to the NCAA for
a sixth year of eligibility was de-
nied Wednesday.

Cook’s season came to an
end last year on‘Dec. 20 against
Duke in Madison Square Gar-
den when he planted hard while
driving through the lane during
overtime.

Cook crumbled to the floor
in pain and left the game. An
MRI later showed that Cook had
suffered from a torn ACL along
with a medial and lateral minis-
cal tear. ‘

Cook sat out the remainder
of the season, missing all of Big
East and postseason play.

He hoped to garnish one
more year as a Panther‘. Last
month he told The Pitt News

that he hadexpected to know the
NCAA’s decision earlier in the
summer but was optimistic at the
time and was keeping a positive
attitude. He said that since it had
gone so long without a decision,
it might improve his chances.

He and Pitt are now left dis-
appointed.

According to NCAA rules, a
player may be guaranteed an ex-
tra year if he played in less than
30 percent of his team’s games.

Cook played in 11 of Pitt’s 37
total games (31 regular season,
six postseason), but the NCAA
only allows one postseason
game to count in the total when
ﬁguring the amount of games
played. So while he really played
in just under 30 percent of the
games, the rules about counting
the postseason puts Pitt’s to-
tal amount of games to just 32.
That means that in the eyes of
the NCAA, Cook played in 34

Students swamp
Activities Fair

by Jordan Fremuth
Staﬂ W/riter

What started with a simple
stroll through Wesley W Posvar
Hall may end with a trip to China,
one among the many potential
outcomes from a trip to yesterday’s
Activities Fair.

"There was barely room for
people to get by,” said Karen
Garelik, a sophomore member
of Heinz Chapel Choir. “It was
crazy-” .

The Activities Fair, held in and

outside of Posvar Hall between 2
and 5 p.m. yesterday, hosted count-
less organizations and the potential
new members who swarmed their
tables looking for new opportur1i—
ties around campus.
 Garelik said that 96 students
signed up to audition for HCC,
whose members may travel to Cl1i—
na at the end of the school year to
perform.

Christine Garrard, a freshman
prospective member for HCC,
said that was definitely a selling
point for her.

“It was actually what first drew
me to their organization,” she
said.

Garrard was excited about the
Activities Fair as a whole. She said
that her strategy was to sign up
for lots of clubs but only to join
a few.

“I just wanted to keep my op-
tions open,” Garrard said. “I want-
ed to keep my bases covered.”

At the -Panther Habitat for Hu-
manity table, students stretched all
along the front and the sides of
the table, and others hunched over
them trying to get information
about the group.

Nick Corsi, a senior at Pitt who
has been involved with Habitat for
Humanity for the past three years,
sounded very pleased about the
fair.

“A lot of people showed up this

year,” said Corsi. “I think we talked _ .

to a lot more people this year than
we did last year.” -

The College Democrats table
was equally congested. Lissa Gei-
ger, the president of College Dem-
ocrats, said that the attendance was
“much better than last year” and
attributed it to the Obama carn-
paigu

Andrew Sabo, a sophomore
and social chair of College Demo-
crats, said he was ecstatic about the
turn out.’

Sabo said that he joined the
College Democrats because he
was excited by the group’s progres-
sive outlook.

“It looked like a good, orga-
nized group, but one that you
could still have a good time with,”
said Sabo. “They didn’t take them-
selves too seriously.”

The table for the Pitt Pathﬁnd-
ers was perhaps the most crowded
of them all. Pathﬁnder representa-
tives could be found on the bot-
tom ﬂoor of Posvar Hall.

Iva Drasinover, a sophomore
member of the Pathﬁnders, is ex-
cited to have new members.

“It’s a really rewarding job,” said
Drasinover. “You get paid, but it
doesn’t always seem like a job. You
get to have a lot of fun and meet a
lot of great people.”

Corsi, of Habitat for Humanity,
also said that the organization usu-
ally doesn’t have to do too much
advertising. .

“The name pretty much sells
itself,” he said.

Katie Getsie, the president of
Pitt’s branch of Habitat for Hu-
manity, said the group received
about 300 names of students who
were interested in joining, but she
suspects many of the students who
signed up will lose interest quickly.

“That number usually goes
down to 150 for the first meeting,”
said Getsie.

South Oakland cliff shelters shrin

by Estelle Tran
Am/zlttant New E3£tor

Pittsburghers who believe that
God is everywhere may be happy
to know that the Blessed Mother
has a watchful eye on the Parkway
East.

' Since 1956, a South Oakland
hillside has hosted a humble
shrine to honor the Virgin Mary.
On Aug. 13, more than 30 faith-
ful attended the Mass at the site
to celebrate the Assumption of
Mary, the clay Catholics believe
that Mary was received into Heav-
en.

“I think one of the pretti-
est things about it is the way the
statue faces and overlooks the city
of Pittsburgh. It’s almost like the
Blessed

Mother throws her mantle
around Pittsburgh,” said Audia
Otto of Murrysville.

The ivory statue of Mary
stands below a pastel wreath,
among candles and pots of silk
ﬂowers.

Since its establishment in
1956, the Shrine of the Blessed
Mother has had numerous addi-
tions, including  altar, various

. cliff-side ornaments and 13 tow-
C ering wooden cruciﬁxes.

This hidden gem resides at the
bottom of the steep brick road of

The silver-and—pearl rosary that adorns the statue of the Virgin Mary can be found on a South Oakland hillside overlooking Interstate Highway 37 6.

Wakeﬁeld Street, which lies at the
bottom of Ward Street.

To get to the shrine, visi-
tors must cut through two front
porches and walk down a brick
path.
There are Masses on the 22nd
of each month at 7 p.m. to corre-
spond with the shrine’s founding
on Sept. 22, 1956.

However, the shrine regulars
hold a special Mass for the As-
sumption of Mary, with a priest
and music.

Audia’s daughter Candace sang
four hymns using a small Marshall
ampliﬁer and was barely audible
over the steady stream of traffic
and ambulance sirens. Candace
was Miss Pennsylvania in 2003
and won the Bernie Wayne Per-
forming Arts Award for her opera
singing.

Even though the Ottos are
very involved in the Pittsburgh
Catholic community, Audia did
not know about the shrine until
a young Candace noticed lights
coming from the shrine as they
drove on the parkway one night.

“It’s really pretty at night, the
way they have thetlights. It just
kind of stands out, and you know
there is something,” Candace
said.

The hill upon which the shrine

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

rests is supposedly the site of
miracles. The woman who started
the shrine, Sophie Toma, saw the
Virgin Mary in a dream.

Mary told Toma that she
would meet a man named Phillip,
and he’d help her with the shrine.

Eventually, they met. Phil-
lip worked at the old Jones and
Laughlin Steel Company mill,
which used to overlook the cur-
rent location of the shrine.

Together they carried the stat-
ue of Mary to the site where Mary
told Toma to go.

When they arrived at the site,
their feet sank into the mud.

They knew it was a sign, and
that’s where they placed the stat-
ue.

Toma’s friend, Sophie Mc-

,Murtry, from Swissvale, took two

buses regularly to tend to the
shrine. One day, she experienced
a miracle on the’ lot when Mc-
Murtry noticed something shin-
ing in the sunlight embedded in
the cliff.

She investigated the gleam and
discovered a sterling silver and
pearl rosary, shrine frequenter
Marty Marek said.

“I looked at this rosary. You
know how sometimes they say
‘made in Italy’? There’s nothing
on there,” Marek said. He knew it

Freshman trombonist

making lots of noise

by Lindsay Carroll
Staﬂ Writer

Brandon Hang never had an ofﬁcial
trombone teacher, and he djdn’t play jazz

‘until his sophomore year of high school.

Yet the 18-year-old Pitt freshman managed
to score the prestigious $5,000 Pitt-Bank

of New York Mellon Jazz Scholarship,

awarded annually to a talented Pitt student
by nationally recognized jazz musicians, in-
cluding Pitt professor Nathan Davis.

Although Hang dccidcd to come to Pitt
based on the pharmacy program, he also
knew he wanted to attend school in a city
where “jazz thrives.”

Hang, who also plays piano, saxophone
and drums, won the award based on his re-

_ cordings of ‘ jazz standards, including 21 bal-

lad and blues sample.

He played one of the tracks on the pia-
no, which gave him an edge over the com-
petition.

His musical wcll—roundedncss impressed
the judges, but Hang was relaijvely new to
playing jazz.

Hang’s ﬁrst instrument waspiano. He
started playing trombone eight years ago
for, the ‘elementary school band. But he
wasrft interested in jazz until he attended a
jazz camp at Lebanon Valley College dur-
ing his sophomore year.

“I thought jazz would be all that big
band stuf ,” said Hang. “It. opened up a
new world where everything was spontane-
ous and only about four people are needed
to do it.” p S

l Although he had a band director, there
was never Ma teacher who really taught” him
about jazz, he said. It was self—motjVation.

“It doesrft really matter what teacher

you have, it’s really all up to you,” said
Hang. ‘

He emphasized that despite receiving
the award, he has goals in terms of musi-
cianship.

“It’s imitation before innovation,” said
Hang. “Pm still at the imitation phase, but I
hope to become a unique performer.”

Learning to play jazz introduced a lot of
musical opportunities for Hang. A fellow
musician and friend, Jonathan Ragonese,
suggested he attend performances at the
.Hilton Harrisburg Hotel, where the Cen-
tral Pennsylvania Friends of Jazz held 
sessions every week.

There, Hang could play alongside local
and international jazz greats, such as Anto-
nio Onorato, an Italian jazz trombonist. He
said the experience was humbling.

“You learn that you suck, basically, and
you have to get better,” he said.

Hang aimed to learn two new songs ev-
ery week. He said it was playing at jam ses-
sions and hearing live performances that
motivated him to excel.

Hang said he wants to pursue music
throughout his life, with solid encourage-
ment from family and friends, but he does
not want to make it a career.

He plans to try out for the Pitt Jazz En-
semble and take Nathan Davis’ History of
Jazz course next semester, which he hopes
will be an easy credit.

The BNY Mellon jazz program part-
ners with various nonproﬁt organizations
in the Pittsburgh area, including Pitt and
_thc Pittsburgh Jazz Society, to provide stu-
dents with music scholarships and sponsor
events and concerts.

Hang’s scholarship is the 22nd annual
award from Pitt andABNY Mellon Jazz.

Pitt seniors Nathan Good and Rachel Samreny moved out of one of the eondemnediproperties on McKee Placetthis May. The apartments will reopen for residents this fall.

by Jessel August Costa III
Staﬂ Writer

After months of work and
hours of litigation resulting in nearly
$500,000 in fines, sotne apartments in
the Oakland area have been given the
green light to resume  in ten-
ants —— just in time for many students
moving into Pitt and other nearby

universities this week. '
Of the three closed apartment
~ buildings, those at 331 and 337 MCK-
ee Place and a larger complex at 3804
Parkview Ave, at least two will be able
to reopen their doors to students for
the coming academic year.
The buildings were forced to close
amid a number of complaints as well
as building and safety code violations.

Their residents were forced to va-
cate until such a time as the buildings
could be brought-up to code.

As of now, the 12—unit apartment
building at 331 lVIcKee Place, as wellas
the 4'2-unit complex at 3408 Parkview
Ave, have both been sufficiently

brought up to code and are again per-
mitted to house local students

the Department of Building Inspec-

tion for the City of Pittsburgh, the

The property at 3408 Parkview
Ave alone required “smoke detectors
throughout, repair to the‘ building’s
fire alarm system, door closures and
thresholds (for ﬁreprooﬁng) through-

out, two or three bedroom windows,
emergency lights, exit signs and van-
ous electrical workj’ said Bossinger.
So far, Bossinger said that BBI has
had no calls about the property since
students have returned to ‘campus.

that all problems have been solved.

was something special.
Another miracle of the shrine

‘is the steady stream of water that
' runs along the hill.

It is because of this stream
that the shrine used to be called
Holy Waters.

The legend goes that the fre-
quenters of the shrine prayed
for water to tend to the ﬂowers,
and then they discovered a small
stream, Marek said.

For the last 15 years, David
Klickovich has organized special
Masses to praise Mary.

He doesn’t mind the work be-
cause so many others worked to
get the shrine to this point.

“The Italian ladies will take
care of the ﬂowers. They put a lot
of hard work into here, and it all
comes from the heart. That’s their
devotion to the Blessed Mother,”
Klickovich said.

Marek chimed in to say that

the nice brick pathway and altar
weren’t always there.

“You know where the cross
is behind the altar? Those Ital~
ian ladies carried those bricks on
their heads, like they did m the old
country. They had to carry them
all the way down that hill. They
didn’t have them delivered here;
they carried three, four, five at a
time,” said Marek.

Candace hopes that a younger
generation will feel a similar sort
of commitment to the area be-
cause the lawn and ﬂowers are a
lot of work to maintain. She and
Audia are grateful to have this
place of peace in the crazy city.

“The Blessed Mother is the
mother,” Audia said. “When a
child is sick, the child seeks out
the mother. I think that’s a com-
fort, being in the arms of the

In late July, Dr. Ronald B. Herber-

 man of the University of Pittsburgh

 Cancer Institute released an advisory

report based on early, unpublished
data that prolonged cell phone use
can significantly increase the risk of
brain tumors and cancer, especially
in children and teens In the advi-
sory, Herberman states that he has
become convinced that cell phones

 pose a significant health risk and that
 precautionary measures should be

taken by cell phone users

If there’s one thing'that’s nice
about this story, it’s that at least some-
one is watching our backs While

j some news sources and critics have
I accused Herberman of fear mon-

gering or  to draw attention
to his research, he’s more than likely
just motivated by nothing more than
a desire to not have the brains of his
fellow humans be slowly poisoned

l to death by cellular radiation.

boxes that tell you exactly how bad
for you they are.

 Despite risks, people unlikely to give up phones 

past several decades —— according to . 

a Gallup poll, from about 26 to 21
percent of Americans in the past 10
years — that still means that nearly
a quarter of Americans stoically ig-
nore the fact that they are substan-
tially increasing their risk of cancer
and other diseases by smoking, even
when the  sign is literally
staring them in the face.

And according to the Cellular
Telephone Industries Association,
about 250 million Americans sub-

scribe to some form of cell phone i

plan. That’s about 82.4 percent, far

more than the number of smokers I

in the country And people are sub-
stantially more dependent on cell
phones in many cases as well Think

aboutthe last time your phone died E
or was lost, and how adversely it af— V

fected your life. Even when work-
ing on this editorial, one editor’s cell
phone went off, and he answered it
by putting it next to his ear.

People are addicted to the con- .
venience and freedom that cellular 
phones allow. It’s likely that the vast 
majority of people will keep using 
them even in the face of substan— 
tial personal harm. After all, there

have already been numerous stud-
ies attempting to link cancer to cell
phones, several of which turned up
positive correlations between the
two. But cell phone use has only
gone up.

In the end, Herberman’s advi-
sory is just that — advice And, re-
gardless of how pure his intentions
are or how reliable his data might be,
people will likely not heed any warn-
ings until they’re printed directly on
their phones And if the current
short-sighted attitude is any indica-
tion, we might still be in trouble even
then. ‘

Give appendixes, save Houdini

    

by Lewis Lehe
Co/um/uiat

Too often, we phrase the organ
donation issue as a question of
what will happen to your corpse
after you die. It’s good to remind
ourselves that it doesn’t matter
what happens to our organs then,
and therefore we should be 
to donate our livers and eyeballs
and hearts and such.

However, we forget that there
are several organs we can donate
long before our time comes, and
just in time for someone who
needs them. Without one of these
‘organs, we can continue living as
usual, and that someone else may
continue living at all.

- A good example is the appen-

Seven to eight percent of
Americans get appendicitis at one

i point in their lives. The appendix

becomes infected and swells up,

ﬁlling with poisons and bacteria.

’ After a point, the appendix bursts

and fills the torso with its danger-
ous cargo, killing the torso and
maybe the patient. I

chests beneath rivers. He broke

tors nicknarned appendicitis “the
silent treasure chest under a river”
and .“the chain not even Harry
Houdini could break free of.”

In a sense, we all have Houdini’s
blood on our hands. Where were
you when you heard about Hou-
dini? What did you do to stop it?
We can wring our bloody hands all
we want, Americans, but the fact is
there was something very easy al-
most every single one of us could
have done.

appendix blew up. But all he really

needed to save his life was some— I

thing to contain his appendix that
could block the chemicalxshrapnel
from its solute supernova  some-
thing tough but organic thatthe
body might not reject. And appen-
dix—shaped, to boot. Another ap-
pendix, for example.

Do you get where I’m going
with this? I’m talking, of course,
about your appendix. The one that
could have saved Houdini. The
one you killed Houdini with, by not
donating it to Houdini. -

someone who desperately needs
a $20,000 surgery for less than
$20,001.

For another thing, appendicitis

itself can make sufferers reluctant .

to undertake the process necessary
to buy health insurance because
they’re afraid of talking frankly with
others about their racked vomiting
and oncoming death.

Whenever I speak about appen-
dix donation —- whether in hall-
ways or public rest rooms or for-
ests — people always try to escape
their responsibility for their fellow
human beings. “You don’t need an
appendix,” they charge.

A fact about the appendix that
critics like to forget, though, is that
you don’t even need your appen-
dix. Why not donate it? One in 20
Americans do not have an appen-

dix. What will they do if they get '

appendicitis? And another 19 in 20
Americans have just one appendix
left. -

Some people shy away from

the surgery involved. But every.

year, hundreds of thousands of
Americans get their appendixes
removed with no complications.
And appendix removal is progress-
ing. Doctors in Argentina recently

engineered a way to take a woman’s

appendix out through her vagina.

lVIcCainad is good only for Obama

    

by Dan Vetanovetz
Colummitt

 
 

For the past few months, I’ve
harbored the secret belief that Sen.
Barack Obama is going to win the
presidential election.

I know, I know, I shouldn’t be so ,

sure. I should address the issue logi-
cally, or come up with three reasons
why he’s going to win instead of
someone else, and so on. I’m aware
that the news outlets I rely on (I’m
looking at you, New York Times)
are kinder to Obama than to Sen.
john McCain. That’s why I’ve kept
the belief to myself. _

However, after seeing McCain’s
ad attacldng Obama for being the
popular kid at the lunch table, I ﬁ-
nally received some objective veriﬁ-
cationof my belief.

The ad I’m  about starts
off with quick shots of Biitney
Spears, comparing Obama to the
unfortunate former pop star through
the magic of juxtaposition. To ce-
ment the junior senator’s painﬁil
relationship with publicity-inflamed

celebrities, the ad also uses a shot of
Paris Hilton.

An announcer smugly begins, “He’s
the biggest celebnty in the world,”
and goes on to make the obvious

conclusion that Obama’s restrict-i

ing offshore  for oil actually
means we’ll be using more of it.

As tempting as it would be to
dissect the argument of the oil issue
presented, what I instead ﬁnd most
interesting is how my former belief
has been validated.

First of  I’m saying the proof is
valid and objective because it comes
from McCain. I can talk all day about
the good  Obama has told me
that he’s done. I could just as eas-
ily spend the weekend ticking off
Democratic party-line reasons why
McCain isn’t the best candidate for
president

But when McCain presents an ad
that depicts him how he wants to be
seen, I’m getting a good view of his
ideals. For example, Obama’s well-
known “Hope” slogan tells me that
Obama ﬁnds hope pretty important.
Even if he’s a closet cynic and thinks
that Iran is dead-set on nuking us

within the year, he ﬁnds the “Hope”
slogan to be agreeable enough to
make it his nickname.

An ad cleriding another candi-
date for being popular tells me that
McCain believes Obama is pretty
popular — so popular, we need to
be told that he shouldn't be. Which
is a ridiculous move to make, consid-
ering the popular vote plays a pretty
large role in the presidential election
— that is, unless it’s the year 2000.

The ad tells me that too many
people like Obama. Bad Americans!
Silly Americans! You can’t like this
guy just because he’s popular! Un-
fortunately for McCain, his ad is
basically saying that we shouldn’t like
Obama solely because we like him. It
sounds like a question worthy of go-
ing into the movie “I Heart Hucka-
bees”: Why, do you like someone
because you like them?

Since the ad has indeed been ap-
proved by McCain, I know he has
enough conﬁdence in its message
to put it on the air. But it isn’t his
conﬁdence in  us for  a

'likeable guy that convinces me that.

Obama’s going to win this election,

It's not like you need it anyhow

Lehe, page 20 ,
Clearly, this isn’t your father’s ap-
pendectomy anymore.

Fortunately, stigma surrounding
appendicitis is vanishing as well.
More and more people feel com-
fortable saying to their doctors, “I
feel like something in my torso,
there on the right, is about to blow
the hell up. And I’m strong enough
to let you help me.” With better
diagnosis, however, the number of
needy recipients’ for an appendix
transplant grows.

You’re probably wondering,
“How do you know so much about
appendixes, Lewis?” Well, even
though I’m a fairly venerable media

ﬁgure, I don’t mind making it pub-
lic: I had my appendix removed.

I went with the traditional pro-
cedure after my doctor, advised me
that there was an urgent need for
my appendix to be removed within
an hour.

When I asked the doctors after-
ward about the possibility of do-
nating my appendix, they told me
it turned out that my appendix was
right about to blow up when they
took it out.

Obviously, such a sorry appen-

dix is no candidate for donation,
but my experience just goes to
show how the life you save could

be your own. My advice to you:
Get rid of the gastral hand gre-
nade that is your appendix ASAP,
and give it to someone who needs
it! .

Ever since my appendectomy,
every time I take off my shirt, I’m
faced with an awesome scar. It
serves as a painful reminder of just
how cool you can look after get-
ting your appendix taken out. And
for that, I carry on, ﬁghting for an
appendix-free America.

so much as history itself.

Speciﬁcally, instead of 
some move to establish himself
more ﬁrmly or spending the money
and energy on publicity stunts of his
own, McCain has fallen into a defen-
sive position. Instead of using his
strongest trait —— experience —— Mc-
Cain is attacking his opponent for
being too popular.

This reminds me of the last pres-
idential election. Remember John

Kerry? I remember  that

the only reason he would win was
that he wasn’t Bush. It was a good
enough reason for me to vote for
Kerry, but some of the more choosy
voters of our nation were in more of
a predicament. None of them knew
much about Kerry, because he spent
so much ‘of his time defending him-
self. Between-insisting that he wasn’t
comparable to breakfast foods man-
ufactured by Ego and responding

to a splinter group of veterans who

may or may not have been telling the
truth, he didn’t establish 
about himself so well.

So why is McCain  the
same mistake and  this elec-

tion lying down? I never thought I’d
see the admirable “Maveric ” acqui-_
esce without at least a few tough—guy. '0
barbs. Has he really been reduced
to muttering quietly about how this
whole election is just a huge popular-
ity contest, and it isn’t fair anymore?
Sadly, I believe that’s exactly, T

what’s happening. By supporting I

the entire Republican Party, McCain
has given up his cowboypersona.
Instead of bringing the outlaws to
justice with the help of a posse of
conscientious lawmakers — did you
know McCain played a prominent
role in denouncing those veterans
who attacked Kerry? — he’s reced-
ing into the wishes of the Republi-
can Party.

I can see only one outcome frorn,_,.
McCain’s self-avowed lack of public
support: restricted from deﬁning
himself as the man who won the
west,_or at least campaign ﬁnance
reform, he’s relegated to losing this
presidential election.

Which makes me wonder:
Obarna—McCain dream ticket?

Ocean: Will Rite, the third album
from Canadian Indie rockers The

The Stills have proven their weight
in both the indie and commercial
music world, but is it possible that
the band has become -complacent?

Perhaps not, but in its attempt tréf,

find where it wants to be catego-
rized, the band has lost the essence
of its musical style.

The Stills is following a formula
for this album. Songwriters often

repeat a song’s title several times‘,

throughout the track, like during a A
chorus. This has somehow trans-
lated into repeating the song title an
inordinate number of times with
little verse in between. The band

seems to think that this, combincshzt

with some long, drawn—out notes,
makes for the perfect song. The

the back by New Musical Express NME) and
the British listening public, The Enemy is head-
ed to the United States,
supported by its debut
album. While the group
released a previous album
of B-sides, its official de-
but, \We’ll Live and Die in
These Towns, holds top-
10 singles like “Away'From Here” and “Had
Enough.” The album itself hit No. 1 in the UK.
in its first week of release.

Following the normal blend of British mu-

 

, sical tastes minting a group acceptable for US.

consumption, the album has been released, and
the band hit Lollapalooza at the beginning of _
this month.

After being declared a chart-smasher by our
overseas Anglo—cousins, is The Enemy ours as
well? While the group supported the Kaiser
Chiefs, The Fratellis and even the mighty Roll-
ing Stones in concert, its sound isn’t as raucous
or humorous as any of its headliners. If any-
thing, it’s more of a rnild-mannered cross be-
tween The Libertines and Oasis. Although it
achieves a lot more than The Braverfs latest
album, it travels in that direction of lighter rock
that trades in hard riffs for happy claps Hap-
pily, in the end, it’s solid Brit-rock,  au-
rally pleasing riffs with transparent chord con-
struction. The album opens with a hard-hitting
quartet of songs. Theyfre characterized by fa-

non-indie—bots among us to resist shaking with
the addictive musie7'In fact, the music is more
danceable than many of the big brother bands

Overall, The Enemy shows its youth by offering
a simple album with sparse but Well-executed
effects

The lyrics are another point of contention.
It all sounds good when it’s thumping out of
your sub-woofer, but lines like, “Do what
you like / Say what you mean / Do what you
please” in the chorus-of “Aggro” are unfair to
curious ears. Similarly, in “Had Enough,” lyrics
like, “Whats the matter with your face, face?”
sound good when they’re in our headphones,
but later lyrics like “If you take a look outside /
You will see, you’re wrong” are disappointing.

Unlike The Libertines, you won’t ﬁnd refer-

ences to James Joyce prose in the tracks by The
Enemy, at least on this record.

Whafs impressive about The Enemy is
that the group keeps up the pressure. All the
way to the final track, the music has high en-

ergy. “This Song,” “Happy Birthday Jane” and 5
“Five Years,” which directly precede “Nation,” A '

there are gems like “Technodanceaphobic” and i

citing to get an album that actually makes up for K

it with constant energy. With that inertia, The

Logic Will Break Your Heart,
the band’s 2003 debut, was a logi-
cal first step, setting a somewhat
moody, alt—rock exemplar. While
not the most innovative style, it was
perfectly satisfying and thoroughly
enjoyable on its own.

W/ith the addition of . Wu‘/your
Feat/Jeri, the band changed its token
pace and overall style. The band
members shunned their expected
path: the release of a second, repet-
itive record. Instead, they evoked a
playful spirit with fresh eyes and
ears that released listeners from a
moody Logic depression.

So here we are. Ocean: Will Rise
completes the sound evolution.
However, there is a ﬂaw in the sys-
tem. The next step? Combine past
styles, get back to your roots, and
create something unique that will
take your music to new heights.
Where there should be innovation,
there is repetition. Where there
should be seamless fusion of style,
there is only an indecisive hodge-
podge of two styles that should

In theory, this record should
be amazing. Logic Will Break Your
Heart and Without Feat/am were
different to be sure, but the feel-
ing of the albums stayed true. The
Stills excelled in both areas but lost
something along the way. Oceom
Will Rise is disappointing — not

because the band chose to release‘

an unexpected album, but because
it was poorly executed.

Fans have said that Without
Feat/yer: was a disappointment, but
they were wrong. It was not Logic,
but it held its own and highlighted
a side of The Stills that deserved
to be shown. Some may argue that
this album is incredible merely be-
cause it is a step toward the band’s
original sound. That does not
make it better. Take a step back,
and take this record for what it is.
This record is confused. By try-
ing to please all listeners, The Stills

percent of Pitt’s games.

Still, Pitt appealed to the NCAA for the extra
year after the medical hardship waiver was denied
by the conference, hoping Cook could be granted
because of extraordinary circumstances.

It was then denied by the NCAA Division I Stu-
dent-Athlete Reinstatement Committee.

Brian Regan, who was named the director of
men’s basketball operations this past summer, said
he is not familiar with exactly how the committee
decides upon who does and does not get extra years

‘of eligibility, but that the coaching staff and team
would be disappointed to see him go.

And although Cook isn’t expected to be at full-
strength for some time, he said Pitt would have liked
to have him back.

“lt’s a shame,” said Regan, who works with
scheduling, planning and other day—to—day basket-
ball operations.

raotban  

Former women’s basketball player Mallorie Winn
was granted a sixth year of eligibility from the
NCAA last yearafter she suffered a similar knee in-
jury in the 2006 preseason.

But since it was before the season started, Winn
was not counted as playing in any of the team’s
games that season.

A Philadelphia native, Cook originally attended
East Carolina University before transferring to Pitt
in 2005.

He sat out one year due to NCAA transfer rules
before starting 48 consecutive games with Pitt.

He averaged 10.4 points and 2.8 rebounds per-

game in his 11 games last year. Pitt was 40-8 in two
years with Cook in the starting lineup.

He graduated last spring with a degree in com-
munication and will be given the chance by the Uni-
versity to stay in‘Pittsburgh while he continues to

rehab his knee.

Summer Workouts pay dividends for Pitt line

Box jumps, medicine ball
workouts and short sprints. Sui-
cides, long distance runs followed
by hours in the weight room. It’s
the summer workout plan for Pitt
football. And newly acquired of-
fensive line coach Tony Wise said
it could make the Panthers roar
again.

Throughout the summer, Pitt
strength and conditioning coach
Buddy Morris, along with other
members of the coaching staff,
set a goal for the Pitt players: to
get leaner, more agile and more
explosive.

The focus was less on weight
gain and more on becoming bet-
ter athletes.

Wise, who coached in the
NFL for the past 18 seasons be-
fore coming to Pitt this spring,
said that a lot of coaches try

ing a drill. Wise said the O-line beneﬁted from Pitt's summer workouts.

forcing weight on their linemen,
thinking it will make them better
in the trenches.

But he said the most impor-
tant thing to do is concentrate
on making them the best football
players they can be — no matter
what weight they are.

“To expect some of these guys
to put on weight just for the sake
of putting on weight, that slows
people down,” said Wise.

“There are a certain amount
of big guys that can do that, but
they’re few and far between.

We’re now about explosion,
quickness and power. Those are
the things we stress.”

But it didn’t come easy.

“Ridiculous,” said Pitt offen-
sive lineman Joe Thomas about
the offseason workouts.

“Disgusting,” added offensive
lineman Jason Pinkston.

Thomas, who played at right _

guard last year before making the
transition to right tackle, said he
lost about 15 pounds during the
summer workouts. .

Thomas said he expects the
lost weight to help him while
blocking the quicker, more ath-
letic defensive ends in the confer-
ence.

Robb Houser, a transfer from
Butte Community College in Cal-
ifornia, said he also made positive
strides and feels more prepared
than ever.

But he added that the work-
outs were some of the most dif-
ﬁcult he’s ever had.

“The first four weeks of sum-
mer we had to run Flagstaff Hill,”
said Houser.

“It was one of the hardest
things I’ve ever done.”

Wise said that Houser, who’s
expected to start at center, was
one of the most impressive play-

Jim Gehrz / Minneapoli tar Triue/CT
Minnesota Vikings’ running back Adrian Peterson (28) is expected
to be a top pick in many fantasy football drafts this upcoming season.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

by Tony Ferraiolo
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

At last, the fantasy football
preseason is over. I can only hope
that no ACLS were lost in the sea-
son’s preparation. Happy drafting
everyone, and here are a few tips
and sleepers to aid your draft.

1. Sharing is for your case of
IC Light, not your fantasy run-
ning back’s carries. Only one run-
ning back per team will put up
the type of numbers that your
fantasy team needs. Too many
teams have transitioned into mul-

tiple running back systems, and

there are very few feature run-
ning backs. It’s essential to get’ the
few there are.

So do your best Mike Ditka
impersonation and trade your
draft number if you have to in
order to snag two of the top—12
running backs. Face it, fantasy
owners: \We’re not going to see
the same'type of running back
production as we have become
accustomed to in past years. Split

backﬁelds have become a disease
that has no vaccine to fantasy
owners. In 10—team leagues, ev-
eryone will have the opportunity
to get one overly productive back,
but only a lucky few will land
two ball—hawk backs. Cross your
ﬁngers and hope you’re picking
behind the guy who thinks it’s a
good idea to draft Tom Brady in
the first round (bad idea), or hope
the stars are aligned and you suc-
ceed the owner who’s tickled by
the idea of drafting two top—f1ve
wide receivers with his ﬁrst two
picks.

2. Develop a value system.
Burying your nose in online or
fantasy magazine rankings can be
helpful only if you don’t orches-
trate your draft according to such
fodder.

For starters, said rankings
are compiled based on a certain
scoring system, but it’s unlikely
that it’s the exact same as your
league’s system. Develop your

- own rankings. Your original rank-

51

all lesson: drafting the ultimate team

ings should consider, above all,

the depth at every position. Un-
like the NFL draft, it’s not nec-
essarily sensible to take the best
player on the board. Break down

the value of each player on a po- <

sitional basis, and weigh it against
the number of players you start
one position compared to others.

3. Don’t draft a quarterback
early unless his value is too good
to pass up. This goes along with
the other mentioned rankings. So
basically, don’t draft Tom Brady
in the first round. My reasons are
multiple. You only start one quar-
terback, while the NFL starts 32.

You do the math. Any of the top— ,

10 quarterbacks has the potential
to put up solid fantasy numbers.
In comparison to running backs,

_ it’s a lot easier to find a quarter-

back to contribute solid numbers.
In effect, drafting a quarterback
instead of a skill player early puts
your fantasy team at a huge dis-
advantage.

drops first game,

by Jasmine Hawkins
Stczﬂ W/rite/'

After gaining an early 2-1 lead against
the University of Akron, the Pitt women’s
soccer team left Lee Jackson Field disap-
pointed Friday night.

Sophomore Liz Carroll scored the first
Panther goal at the 11-minute mark off a
pass from Laura Berbet, but Akron’s Kate-

lyn Hausfeld responded two minutes later

to tie the game, then again with another
goal to start an avalanche of scoring and
lead Akron to the 6-2 win. ,

Britni Back and Leigh Cullen also added
goals to seal the 6-2  v

With ﬁve unanswered goals, the Zips
gave Pitt an unanticipated loss and an eye-
opening lesson.

Pitt coach Sue—Moy Chin said she didn’t
really see the game turning out how it did.

“Overall we were’ disappointed and
shocked at how we responded in the game,”
said chm. ’ _

“We eased up after the first goal, and we
weren’t sharp at all because we played as
individuals.” ‘

Chin said that Pitt will learn from the
loss and that she is looking forward to hav-
ing a successful season. I 1

The Panthers regroup this week and
prepare for the match—up against Dayton
Friday evening to kick off a tournament at
the ‘University of "Illinois.

“I think we are going to be OK” said
Chin. .

“Hopefully we got the bad play out of
our season so. we can go back to playing
Pitt soccer.”

The Panther women have a tough Big .
East schedule ahead of them, along with .
several aggressive and strong out-,of-con- 
ferencc opponents in teams like Illinois, 3

Charlotte and Arizona.

Big East play begins on the road Sept. 7”
18 against West Virginia. Pitt will also face 
Syracuse, Rutgers, South Florida, Mar- 

quette and Seton Hall on the road.

Chin said that if her team can start play— 

ing with more cohesion and stop playingas
individuals, Pitt will be a strong team and
should pull off some good wins.

And after ending last year  a dis-
appointing record of 6-10-2, she said the
expectations for a rebound are high 
around; ' l

Pitt returns eight starters and 15 letter-
winners from last season, and much of the
team’s success will bepushed to its youth-

The Panthers have only two seniors in

Jennifer Kritch and Kylie Vevcrka. Krifch 

and junior Ashley Habbel led the team last
year in goals (ﬁve each), and the entire dc-
fense returns as well.

. Habbel, a forward who started all 18 '

games a year ago, also led Pitt in assists,
points and game—winning goals. A

At goalie the Panthers return junior Ali— .
son Finch and sophomore Morie Kcphart. 3

Finch and Kephart both have starting ex-
perience.

“We had a strong preseason, and we
have depth in every position,” said Chin.

“We also have exciting matchups on our
schedule, so right now our focus is on get-
ting back to where we know we can play so
we can take on Dayton next Friday”

It wasn’t exacdy opening day, but a

ers throughout the summer workouts. He
added that the offensive line, which Pitt
coach Dave Wannstedt said is still one of
the biggest question marks heading into
the season, has made strides in the right
direction - especially since it’s been facing
one of the deepest defensive lines in the

 country every day. V

“All of our guys have to feel really good
heading into Saturdays,” said Wise about
the offensive line.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.Com

“They’re blocking Tommie [Duhart],
Mick [\X/illiams] and Greg [Romeus]. There
are no plays off.”

Houser agreed.

“There’s no better way to prepare for a
game,” said Houser.

“Our guys [on the defensive line] are
some of the best.”

Pitt lost offensive linemen Mike McG—
lynn and Jeff Otah to graduation. Both
were drafted into the NFL and leave big

holes in their spots.

But Wise said plenty of players im-
proved and are ready to make a big impact
when the season starts.

“You have to look at the weight |]oe
Thomas] has lost and the condition he’s
in,” said Wise. “Robb Houser also had a
very good offseason. So did Jordan Gibbs.
Everyone improved their foot speed and
quickness, and we’re getting better every

day.”

m

Pitt defensive line coach Greg Gattuso
said he saw this improvement while com-
paring the offensive line in the spring to
the offensive line at the end of the sum-
mer, and he added that the physical condi-

tion of the players was one of the biggest;

reasons why.

“Buddy [Morris] does a terrific job with
our guys,” said Gattuso. “We want to be
lean, fast and powerful. Buddy did a great
job doing that.”

per game. _

5. Having too many players in one of-
fense can be detrimental. In head—to—head
leagues it’s not about the overall points guys
get. Especially in the latter stages of the

year, having multiple players in one offense
can torch your playoff transcript. Winning
in the playoffs is about tremendous per-
formances. To dodge bullets in the play-
offs, you need to have multiple huge per-
formances, and, while it can happen, the

odds of a running back and a receiver in
the same offense busting out is slim. Also,
if you have multiple players from one team
and that team has a playoff spot locked up,
you might be relegated to starting Kyle Or-
ton in your championship game.

Draft Sleepers

Jericcho Cotchery: WR, NY] — Forget
for a moment that No. 4 is manning the
ship for the jets. Cotchery’s numbers have
improved annually. He’s caught 82 balls

each of the last two seasons. The only
problem? Last year Cotchery only caught
two touchdowns. Enter Mr. Favre. Cotch—
ery is primed for a huge year, especially
considering you can probably grab him in
the sixth or seventh rounds of your draft.
Anthony Gonzalez: WR, IND — Re-
member when Brandon Stokley had 68 re-
ceptions, 1,077 yards and 10 touchdowns
for the Colts in 2004? It’s not so far—fetched
to think Gonzalez could post comparable

numbers. In 13 games last year as a rookie,
Gonzalez had 37 receptions for 576 yards
and three touchdowns. If Peyton Man—
ning rebounds from his knee surgery and
Marvin Harrison doesn’t rebound, Gonza-
lez will have monster value.

Jerious Norwood: RB, ATL — With
Norwood it’s not a question of whether he
can be productive (he runs a 4.33 40-yard
dash), but whether he’ll get the touches.
The Falcons acquired Michael Turner in
the offseason to be their starting running
back, but Turner has never shouldered a
full workload in the NFL. Norwood aver-
aged six yards per carry last year.

Ted Ginn Jr: WR, MIA — I know Chad
Pennington is calling the signals for the
Dolphins, but it looks like Ginn will be Mi-
ami’s default No. 1 receiver. With Penning-
ton at the helm in 2006, Laveranues Coles
caught 91 balls. Ginn is electric, there’s no
doubt about that. And if he becomes the
focal point of Miami’s passing attack, he
could be valuable. Think about it. When
else can you recall any team’s No. 1 re-
ceiver slipping to the 12th round? If Ginn
does, grab him.

Predictions

I’m really going to go out on a limb I

here. I think LaDanian Tomlinson is go-

ing to have a huge year. What else is new? ,

While LT is still the consensus No. 1 fan-
tasy choice, I can’t help but get the feeling
his projections are too low. The whole left
side of San Diego’s offensive line went to
the Pro Bowl last year, as did Tomlinson.

And now LT owners don’t have to worry.

about Michael Turner spelling Tomlinson’

for whole series at a time. Most projections "

have LT around 15 rushing touchdownsf,

I’m thinking more like 20-25.
Adrian Peterson is a dangerous choice.
He’s going to put up numbers, but I don’t

know about top—two pick numbers. I really I
can’t figure out why anybody would con».

sider taking Peterson ahead of the likes of
Brian Westbrook, Joseph Addai or Steven
Jackson. I’m sure two 200—yard games, in-

cluding an NFL record 296-yard game, will 

have something to do with it. Peterson is an
amazing talent, the kind who could make

me eat my words, but he’s got a history of 7 '

wearing down. After setting the record, in
his last six games of the year Peterson av-

eraged just 51 yards and scored four touch- 
downs, including a putrid 14 carry, three-  0
yard performance against a San Francisco 0
defense that allowed 118.5 rushing yards”

per game last year. I’m sure his sprained
MCL had something to do with his decline

in production, but then again, Peterson has .
been hampered with injuries throughout ~'

his football career. He’s a red flag.
