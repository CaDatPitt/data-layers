Three Pitt
students  
assaulted

By Manuel Hernandez
Sta_[7‘Writer
Two juveniles were

apprehended Tuesday evening
and charged with mugging two
female Pitt students in Shadyside,
the attempted mu gging of a third
Pitt student in South Oakland,
and another possible mugging in
Shadyside.

The female juveniles were
arrested after the victim in South
Oakland positively identified the
two. Campus police searched the
the juveniles and found the knives
used in the robberies.

Campus police also discovered
the purses matching the
descriptions made by the earlier
robbery victims.

The first victim was robbed at
9:50 p.m. at Ellsworth and
Colonial streets in Shadyside,
according to police reports. The
assailants allegedly threatened the
victim with knives and demanded
money. The victim was not
harmed in the incident.

The second incident occurred
at South Aiken and Amberson
streets in Shadyside. The victim
was reportedly also held at
knife point and was forced to hand
over money to_ the suspects,
according to police . The second
victim was also unharmed.

A possible third mugging
occured in Shadyside, but police
are uncertain at this point.

“A female victim called police
and said she had been mugged.
When a police officer arrived at
the location, she specified no
one was found,” said Detective
Daniel Herrmenn of the Pittsburgh
Police Department.

The suspects allegedly
approached the fourth victim from ~
behind just after 11 p.m. at the
intersection of York and Louisa
streets, according to police.

One allegedly held a knife to
the victim's throat and demanded
money. The victim was able to
use self-defense techniques to
force the knife to the ground and
flee the scene, police said.

Student groups join to form Coalition

By Manuel Hernandez
Staff Writer

Member of three campus organizations
came together last night to form the
Coalition for Safer Sex, which plans to ask
the university to place condom-dispensing
machines in campus buildings.

The group is headed by Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance co—chairs for
education Adam Novak and Trish Palrniere ~

and wants to make safer sex more ,

accessible to students.

The coalition is planning to meet with
the Student Health Service, the Office for
Residence Life and Student Activities to
investigate placing the machines in all
campus housing, including dormitories
and fraternity houses. ' '

The machines will contain more than
one type of condom, and a message about
safer sex will be displayed on the front of
the machine.

The group plans to do research to

determine which type of condoms are
safest to use. The condoms are expected
to cost 50 cents each. ,

Student Government Board President
Gil Golden supports installing" condom
machines in campus buildings.

“I don't see any problem with it
whatsoever. There's nothing revolting
about condom machines," he said.

Because sexually transmitted diseases
are rampant on college campuses,

‘condoms need to be made available to

for Safer Sex

students, Golden said. “We’re talking life
or death,” he said. _

Student Health provides condoms, ‘but
the office isn't open late at night when

many students might need them, he said. ' V ‘A
Student Health's pharmacy would be '

responsible for ensuring that all machines
are functional and supplied with condoms
under the plan proposed by the coalition.

Students should assess

damages and understand their
apartment leases before signing
them, according to local attorney
Mark Galzerano.

Galzerano answered questions
yesterday during an open forum
sponsored by the Freshman
Council of the Student
Government Board.

When renting an apartment
students should ‘thoroughly
review the lease before signing
it. to prevent any future problems
over stipulations of the lease, he
said. He also warned students to
note the terms of the lease to
ensure that future moving plans
and summer vacations won't
depend on breaking a lease.

“It is very difficult to break a
lease. Try to work things out
with the landlord. Sometimes you
can work out a deal,” he said.

‘Galzerano also discussed
methods to recover a security
deposit after moving out. He
recommended examining the

 .9     Lawyer advises students

apartment prior to moving in and
noting any damage. I

He said taking photographs of
the apartment can help if a
security deposit is unjustly
withheld.

“The most important thing you
can do is make your landlord
aware of any damage to the
apartment before you sign the
lease. This helps prevent you
from being held responsible for
any damage prior to you moving
in, “ he said.

If the landlord refuses to return
the security deposit, steps can be
taken to resolve the conflict.
Galzerano recommended
attempting to resolve the dispute
with the landlord. If all attempts
fail, he said legal action can be
taken. _

“If your landlord doesn’t return
the security deposit and you feel
you deserve it, you can file a
claim with the District Justice. If
the security deposit is not returned
with 30 days after moving out,
you can sue for twice the amount
of the security deposit,” Galzerano
said.

more condoms. Currently,

condoms are sold at two locations
on campus: the Student Health
pharmacy and Towers Express.
Neither location is open 24 hours.

“Student Health has been
interested in placing condom-
dispensing machines on campus
locations, but they need students
to express an interest first,” Novak
said. 9 ,

The coalition plans to establish
student interest by sending letters
to all campus organizations to
get a list of groups to support the
move.

With university approval the
coalition would like to expand
the program to include other
university buildings, including
the William Pitt Union, Forbes
Quad and the Cathedral. »

The Campus ' Women's
Organization, BiGALA and the
Student Health Advisory Board
were_represented at the meeting.

“Student health is totally willing
to finance the project. They want
it; they’ve just waited for us to tell
them,” Palmiere said.

suspects then turned
around and walked away
from the location.

The victim returned to
her home in South Oakland
and phoned campus
police.

After filing a report,
campus police spotted two
females at the intersection
of Fifth Avenue and Darragh
Street matching the third
victim's description of her
assailants.

The suspects were held
by campus police until the
victim could be escorted to
the location, and the third
victim was able to positively
identify the two, police
said.

The suspects were
arrested by campus police
and charged with robbery,
possession of an instrument
of a crime, recklessly
endangering another
person, conspiracy and
receiving stolen property.

‘Virtual reality’ brings science ﬁction to

By Scott Nespor
For The Pitt News

Imagine visiting an architect’s
office and walking through the
plans for your new house. You
walk over to the wall and turn on
the light switch. The room lights
up. You decide that you do not
like the location of a closet and
the room needs a bigger window.

The architect hits a couple of
buttons on the computer, and
again you are in the room, looking
out the window. But you do this
even before construction has
started.

No, this is not science fiction——
but reality. Virtual reality, that
is. 2

According to Michael Spring,

-an associate professor in Pitt’s

information science department,
this technology, called “virtual
reality,” now exists. Itmakes users
feel as if they are actually in

another place, but in truth
they are interfacing with
computers.

It is now possible to walk on
Mars in your own home or have
a multi-player, interactive game
of Dungeons and Dragons,
complete with scenery.

Of ‘course, you need about
$120,000 worth of computer
equipment.

The heart of the equipment is
the eyephones, big goggles that
have two Sony Watchman

televisions optimized for graphics.-

Each TV is connected to a $60,000
computer.

A screen for each eye helps to
give an impression of a three-
dimensional world.

The goggles are outfitted "with
reflectors and cameras that
measure each movement of the
head.

When you turn your head to
the right, you can see whatever

scenery the computer has
calculated to be there. Or when
you look down, you see your
foot take a step.

There are also data gloves
which measure the hand’s
movement. So when the
computer has put you on the
moon, you can actually lean over
and see your hand pick up a
rock. ’

Even though you have actually
have picked up nothing, the
computer calculates the weight
of the rock and applies an equal

A pressure to your hand.

A data suit does similar things
for the entire body. As you walk
toward the Eiffel Tower, it appears
that you are getting closer.

You start to run, and the
computer calculates your speed
and makes the appropriate

adjustments.

You can take part in a World
War 11 battle, or walk through the
streets of ancient Greece. With
the stereo speakers for each ear,
it will sound as if you are there,
too.

Spring said there are two ways
of looking at virtual reality: the
pla'y—toy aspect and its practical
use in business.

When looking at its function as
a toy, Spring tries to “fool the
senses by correctly stimulating
them with artificial means.” ‘

Virtual reality can also be used

in education and training for pilots .

and astronauts.

But when looking at the
possibility that virtual reality has
when it comes to creating new
surroundings, it seems possible
that some people might use it as

I

 

an escape.
Spring admitted
people will live in t eir own

worlds and become addicted to

them.

But Spring looks at another
achievement, the printing press,
and pointed out that people were
worried that others would waste

time reading. I 2'

“Every technology created since
the beginning of time has been
an escape,” said Spring.

Virtual reality can also be used A

in business. Spring said the

possibilities that exist are"

boundless.

“What are the rules that govern. I

for the most part, still confined to
the realm of opinion.

In January 1991, then-black
studies Chair Dennis Brutus urged
students to join together and say
“No blood for oil.” Was the Gulf
War an oil war?

“I don’t think that [multi-
national oil companies] played a
major role in the decision to take
military action, but itsoon became
clear that after Hussein moved
into Kuwait, his next target would
be Saudi Arabia,” according to
Professor of Public and
International Affairs Marshall
Singer.

Singer said that if Hussein
would have been permitted to
capture and hold Saudi Arabia,
he would have possessed 45 to
50 percent of the world’s oil
supply. Because the controller of
Saudi Arabia controls the oil
beneath all of the Gulf states,
Hussein could have been at the
reigns of 60 to 80 percent of the
world’s petroleum, Singer said.

“He would have had us by the
oil barrels,” Singer said, adding
that oil is the lifeblood of the free
world’s economy.

Alleged price-gouging at the
beginning of the war was
probably caused by an uncertainty

in world oil markets, Singer said.

“We’re actually paying less for
oil now than before the war, but
that’s because the Saudis are being
so nice and compliant” in taking
up the slack for the paralyzed
Kuwaiti oil industry, Singer said.

“So much of the Saudi family’s
money is in the United States.
They have to make certain that
we’re healthy. Of course, that’s
good for us, but not so good for
others,” Singer said.

Singer said that like Kuwait,
bomb-ravaged Iraq is also in need
of intense reconstruction. If
Hussein is removed from power
or if current embargoes are lifted
in the near future, Singer predicts
that companies from Western
Countries will be “jumping in” to
bid on lucrative construction
contracts.

Professor of Communications

Ted Windt said that Bush’s 90-
percent approval rating at the
beginning of the war was “inﬂated
and artiﬁcial” and “transitory.”
Windt attributed initial support
of the war to the way world
events were perceived by the
American people and
characterized by the president.

Bush used “very effective
rhetoric, especially in making the
transition from using the troops
for purely defensive purposes to
the attacking, or ‘liberation,’,as
Bush called it, of Kuwait,” Windt
said.

“Once the war was over with 
that high-water mark of 90 percent
began to slide,” Windt said.

Windt, who occasionally offers
political commentary for local
news radio station WKQV, is
confident that George Bush will
be re—nominated. But what

remains uncertain is what effect
the president’s performance
during the Gulf war will have on
his re-election attempt.

“[The war] is yesterday’s news.
People are having second
thoughts about how successful
we really were,” Windt said.

“The economy is the most
inﬂuential variable in an election.
It is more pressing and more
immediate. Right now, we’re in
the midst of the longest recession
since World War II. That’s not
good for Mr. Bush,” Windt said.

Windt said the fall of the Soviet
Union, in removing America's
primary adversary, also removed
the need for a national anti—
communist ideology. As a result,
economic issues are first and
foremost in the minds of voters.

Windt said the fact that the

seem unbalanced. We tried
to find more people that
were pro—war, but we just
couldn’t,” she said.

Bush said she wanted the
panel to be open and
objective but also said, “I
am convinced that if people
see the facts, they will agree
with lPSfPl and see that we
are right.”

Bush said the biased
media made it difficult for
the American public to
know the full reality of the
Gulf war.

"I have great contempt
for the media. I see the fact
that America did not get the
full truth‘ a failure on the
part of the media.
Thousands of people have
died since the end of the
Gulf war,” she said.

Eirene said that the
American public suffered as
a result of media censorship.

“We had no information
because it didn’t appear on
television. There’s an old
saying from the ’60s, ‘If it
didn’t appear on TV, itdidn’t
happen.’ People have really
relied on the media to be
their saviors.”

Eirene pointed to the
bombing of the Ameriya
shelter as an example of
how the media is censored.

“[The American public]
were told that Ameriya was
a telecommunications site,
when it was really a shelter
for civiliansi”

According to Eirene, 317
of the 325 women and
children in the shelter were
killed.

War

militarily is of little significance
when people are more concerned
about whether or not America
can beat Japan economically.

If the bearing that the Gulf war
will have on George Bush’s
political future is uncertain, the
impact it had on the success of
television mogul Ted Turner is
unquestionable. . .

“lThe Gulf War] was a triumph
for CNN,” Windt said, saying that
the all—news network’s 24-hour
news service was popular in a
situation as fast-paced as the Gulf
war. CNN revolutionized the art
of war correspondence through
its use of actual bomb-site footage
and satellite communication with
reporters behind enemy lines.

I-Iussein’s scorched-earth
withdrawal from Kuwait resulted

in some of the most concentrated
and severe environmental
damage to occur on the face of
the planet.

“There are a lot of possibilities

for environmental damage to‘

occur,” said William Coffman,
associate professor of biology.
The most obvious source of
environmental damage stemmed
from the burning of the) Kuwaiti
oil ﬁelds set ablaze by Hussein's
retreating army. Smoke from the
oil fires blotted out the sun and

choked Kuwaiti citizens for weeks

areas of saturated sand, according

Lessons from the war

1 One short year ago, the eyes of America and the world
were transfixed on the mobilization in the Middle East.
Having been given the OK by Congress, George Bush
gave the go-ahead for the allied force in the gulf to begin
bombing the land of Saddam Hussein.

Despite the American people’s overwhelming support
for the coalition effort against Iraq, the nation experienced
a collective lump in the throat upon first seeing the skies
over Baghdad illuminated by the ammunition of war.

As we viewed Israeli children putting gas masks on their

faces in fear of chemical weapons, the tragedy of war

' seemed all too apparent. -

This war, like all wars, finally came to a close. The
American people toasted returning soldiers with ticker-
tape parades and yellow ribbons.

And as the e/mir of Kuwait was once again free to shut
down the newspapers that criticized him and the casualties
on our side were lower than expected, George Bush
yelled, “Victory!” and watched his popularity rise to a
personal all-time high. A

Little by little, though, Bush’s efforts started to draw fire.
The hawks grumbled that Saddam Hussein was still in
power, and the doves ‘lamented the ' pre-industrial
conditions the bombing had left Iraq in.

Even the media began questioning its own tactics
during the war. Had it been too much of a cheerleader?
Why had it gladly taken allthe reports from the military
as the absolute truth? ,

. Much of the glamour and glitz of our “victory” has faded
in the past months. A

‘Bush’s popularity has soured with the economy, and the
unemployed are wondering if the billions spent on the-
war couldn’t have been better used here in America.

People are starting to point the finger at Bush for waging
war to get re-elected. I --

Amazingly, no one complained that Bush was a wimp
after the war. _ l_

He was also able to defer criticism by invoking the idea
that if you opposed him, you were opposing the brave
men and women on thefiring lines. I _

James Baker might argue that, after the war, Middle East
peace talks began; however the apparent failure of these
summits to produce any form of long-lasting peace
further proves that America is out of place in trying to
mediate stability in land foreign to its own.

The true test of America’s lessons from the Gulf War may
only be-found when the leaders of our country again feel
it necessary to make us the policing body of our world.
Perhaps there won’t be an election just around the corner,
and cooler heads will prevail.

America is in a recession, and
everyone must modify their
behavior in order to get through.

recession and find, themselves
happily on the other side.

The recession, among other
economic concerns, also poses
problems for American cities.
Falling tax revenues and unwise
spending policies have put major
cities in a precarious situation.
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are
among the localities slicing their
budgets.

While the need for budget cuts
is undeniable, there is_ a real
problem with how the cities are
creating the reductions. In both
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, one

Lady Panthers pirate  
one away from, ‘Hall . 

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Few teams could rebound from
the loss of one, let alone two,
starters and have a chance to stay
in a basketball game.

The,Seton Hall Bucettes were
without the services of leading
scorer and rebounder Kelley
Moore and 13-game starter Tara
Stevens. After they came down
with the flu, both players did not
dress for last night’s contest
against the Pitt Lady Panthers .

Their teammates jumped out
to an 11-point, 41-30,‘ halftime

'' lead, but the deeper Lady Panther

bench eventually wore them
down, pulling out a 74-69 victory.

Three players scored 18 points
each to lead Pitt. Sophomore
forward Jill Colabrese broke out

of a recent scoring slump for her

18, including eight for eight from

the free—throw line. Jonna.

Huemrich, a sophomore center,
continued her impressive
showing for the current
campaign, tossing in 18 as well.
Thirteen of those came in the
second half. Sophomore shooting
guard Erin Maloy added her 18
points on four—of-six shooting
from three—poir_1t'land and six out
of six from the charity stripe.

“I thought we played an
average first half,” Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce said. “However we
came out, and our defense did an

excellent job holding‘ them to 28 .

giving up 41 in the first.“

In addition to a personality
described as
“marvelous,” Knobloch also
knows a thing'or two about
swimming. She has competed in

seven different events so far,‘

ranging from sprints in her best
events (backstroke and butterﬂy)
to relays and middle—distance
freestyle events.

Belowich noted that he was
unaware of her talentsin the 200-
yard freestyle.“ It was not until
racing her inthe 200, as a bit of
a test, that he found this unknown
commodity. “I wanted to see what
she could do in the 200," Belowich
said. “From what I knewabout
Christy, it was an event that didn’t
have a reference point. To do
what she did [in the 200]'is an
extra bonus.”

The “extra bonus” of her 200
performance‘ capped a marvelous

"nabbed a team-high four berths

Knobloch, something most first-

said. “Being with the team, doing

Knobloch admitted, “but after two
or three weeks into the semester,
I knew I could handle it.”

For Knobloch, the choice to

_ leave sunny Florida for the winters

of Pittsburgh was based on the
positive vibes she received from
Belowich and the team ‘— a
feeling that she was “really
wanted.” “Other schools I visited
seemed less enthusiastic,”
Knobloch said. “And with Pitt, I
had a great time ‘during _the

Knobloch began swimming
“around the age of 8 or 9.” It was
then that she determined she
would become a collegiate
swimmer. She revealed that those
preteen wishes
unknowingly documented by her
parents for posterity. “Over the
holidays when I was home, my
mother showed me a scrapbook,”
Knobloch said, “and I actually
wrote that when I was 20, I
wanted to be a swimmer and an

Christy credits the -longtime
support of her parents, as well as

anyone who relies on her, for.

came from her-local swim club in .

Pitt wrestling head coach Rande
Stottlemyer received a big lift
Tuesday when he learned that
the eligibility of redshirt junior
Bobby Simpson has been
restored.

Simpson, who will wrestle at
either the 118- or 126—pound
weight class, sat out last season
due to academics. Two years ago
he qualified for the NCAA
championships and came within
one victory of earning All-
American status.

With practices heating up,

Stottlemyer said he looks at this
as a big lift for the Panthers as
they prepare for their Eastern
Wrestling League opener against
the Lock Haven Bald Eagles
tomorrow night at the Fitzgerald
Field House. Stottlemyer said
Simpson won't be returning to
the lineup immediately, but he
expects an impact when he does.
“He’s a real tough kid; he’ll
make a big difference,”
Stottlemyer said. “He gives us
some depth down below, at 18 or
,.26, plus he gives us quality.”
In recent years the Panthers
have battled Lock Haven in a
series of tight matches. Last season

these two teams locked up in an
intense contest that the Bald

went on to a 5-2 league record,
and its head coach, Carl Poff, was
named the PSAC Coach of the
Year.

The Panthers anticipate another
tough matchup this time around.
Stottlemyer said he feels that
almost every weight class could »
go either way.

always a shock to the new guys
—just the environment. The older
guys knew what it was all about,
but the younger guys didn’t. Now
everybody’s kind of over that."

Pitt is counting on its ﬁrst—year
class to produce immediately. At
126, John Richey turned in a solid
performance last weekend, and
he, along with Shawn Kennedy,
will be tested early.

“They’re gonna need time, and
if you give them time, they’ll
come around,” Stottlemyer said.

“It’s going to come down to the
freshmen. It’s going to be up to
them to perform as sophomores
instead of freshmen,” Miller said.

Following a lackluster opener
against Clemson, Stottlemyer
stressed to his team the
importance of the league opener.
“Monday’s practice was certainly
an awakener for them, and they
responded,” he said. Stottlemyer
said Lock Haven has a significant
advantage in experience, having
already wrestled to a 10-4 dual-

I meet record. Hovan said he feels

his teammates will be prepared - I

for the challenge.

“I think this Friday, wrestling a

league team, the guys are going
to be a lot more excited than
Clemson,” Hovan said.

By Stephen Liss
T be Pitt News

Unless you’ve been a student
at Pitt for the last 12 years, you
probably don’t remember the
antics of one of the greatest
crowd-pleasers to ever stalk the
sidelines of a Panther basketball
game. I’m not talking about
Carlton Neverson or Clyde
Vaughan; I’m talking about
“Tiger” Paul Auslander.

The zany cheerleader, who was
never accused of having all of his
screws, electrified the student
section with reckless abandon.
Tiger Paul didn’t do ﬂips, he
didn’t stand on anyone’s
shoulders, and he didn’t win a
national championship for being
the best cheerleader in the
country. What he did do was
ignite the fans just by being
himself: crazy. 4

Nobody really knows what
happened to Auslander. Some
speculate that the newly formed
cheerleaders ranhim out of town,
while others say Tiger Paul

« wanted a few greenbacks from

the blue and gold for doing his
hardcourt routine. Regardless of
the circumstances, since the arm-
ﬂailing days of Tiger Paul, no one
has been able to duplicate the
response that Auslander elicited
from the crowd until now.

For a dozen years, season—ticket
holder Paul Hipp and his wife
Lillian have graced the blue-seat
section of the Fitzgerald Field
House. But if you ask Lillian,
she'll tell you that the Hipps

- could save a lot of money if they

just bought one seat, because the
only time Paul sits down is to rest
his mouth.

Hipp is what is affectionately
known as a heckler. His season
tickets are conveniently located
right behind the scorers table,
within earshot of the visiting

'I'HE pm NEWS, Thursday, January’ 16, 1992

‘Pozm‘berPoml ’ newfieldgeneml of ‘Fieldloouse Fomatz'cs’“

teams’ bench. Good, clean, well-
thought-out insults flow from
Hipp’s lips like honey. But
heckling isn’t Hipp’s only racket;
he has added a new dimension to
his game.

When Seton Hall visited the
Field House on Jan. 2, Hipp
jumped out of his chair during a
timeout. Instead of barking at
Pirates’ head coach P.}. Carlesimo,
Hipp stepped into the aisle and
began to wave his arms to the
beat of.a catchy tune strummed
up by the band. Before Hipp
knew what was going on, the
Fieldhouse Fanatics were
emulating his bushwacking jig.
Immediately Hipp became
“Panther” Paul, a new institution.

Since the Seton Hall game,
Panther Paul has made his mark.
For the Duquesne and Syracuse
games at the Civic Arena, Hipp
pumped up the crowd from his
seat behind the press table. Then,
before the Providence game at
the Field House, Hipp said, “lPitt
head coach] Paul Evans told me
to get out there and get the fans
into the game.”

That was Panther Pa-ul,.’s
coming—out party. L
Providence took the lead with
18 minutes left in the second half,
and the crowd was virtually non-
existent. One of the cheerleaders
gestured for Hipp to come out on
the floor and help get the fans
back into the game. Not wasting
his opportunity, Panther Paul
darted out to the Fieldhouse
Fanatics’ section and began his
trademark dance. “I don’t want to
-take anything away from the

cheerleaders,” Hipp said, “but if

they ask me to come out and help
lead cheers, 1 will!”

The 6,798 fans responded
immediately to the chubby man’s
enthusiasm. They were yelling

and screaming at the top of their

lungs, and the basketball team
responded. Sparked by the crowd,

Pitt put together a solid second

half of basketball, beating the

Friars 83-72 for its third straight

Big East victory.

In his cocoon, Paul Hipp, the

50-year-old Westinghouse

employee, is a husband, a father
and a loving grandfather. But

when Panther Paul spreads his
wings -— look out! Especially if
you’re Rollie Massimino, the head
coach of the Villanova Wildcats.
“When the basketball "season
starts,” Hipp said, “the first thing
I do is look on the schedule for
the Villanova game."

Three years ago Panther Paul
had a verbal battle with Massimino
that led Rollie to reveal his true
colors. “Rollie loves to strut the
sidelines,” Hipp said. “So every
time he walked by my seat, I
blurted out a few things that
didn’t sit too well with him.
Toward the end of the game they
were losing really bad, and Rollie
turned to me and said, ‘Hey you
fat f—! I'll see you outside after
the game!” '

Hipp’s wife Lillian said she
enjoys her husband’s escapades.

“I love going to the games with
him,” Mrs. Panther Paul said. “In
12 years we haven't missed a
single game. With the exception
of the Villanova incident, what
he does is just clean fun.”

This year Villanova will be at

A the Field House on Feb. 10. Hipp

explained why he can’t wait:

“Rollie knows I’m here every I

time he comes to Fitzgerald. This
year I’ve got something special
for him.”

Rumor has it that Panther Paul

will be leading cheers while .:A in

wearing a special message on his
shirt for the Wildcat head coach.

“This is one of the mostk

enjoyable teams Pitt has ever

had,” Hipp said. “All I want to do V

is help this team win. If that
means getting out of my seat to
do it, that’s fine with me.”

It's great to see fans like Panther
Paul participating. College

basketball is all about homecourt _

advantage.

Hipp helps give Pitt the

advantage that has allowed the
basketball team to win all but
two games at the Field House in
the last 2 1/2 seasons.

. I now present to you, the

student body of the University of p . S.

Pittsburgh, Panther Paul. Learn
his name and look for him in the
stands and on the floor. He is our
institution. He is the field general
for the Fieldhouse Fanatics.

Stone’s latest controversy

By Alon Orstein
Staff Writer

In the_ wake of the new Oliver Stone film, there has been an almost
unprecedented wave of commentary regarding JFK. Rightly so; the film
plunges headfirst into one of the most hotly debated and keenly felt issues
of our time. It is Mr. ‘Stone’s or any human being’s prerogative to elaborate
on diverseviews, regardless of how controversial the conclusions may be.
However as a result of the passionate political and social discourse
accorded, we have failed to focus on the main topic, which is the overall

worth of the ﬁlm itself.

Throw out the criticism regarding “bogus history.” This, for all practical
purposes, is moot. What we are left with is an arresting work, a largely
expository, proselytized film that leaves the audience bludgeoned.

I have been a fan of Stone for quite some time. Midnight Express (screenwriter
credit), Platoon, Wall Streetand Salvadorwere all powerful films that, despite being
rather blatant in approach, managed to pull the viewer in with carefully constructed

K  

and absorbing progressions. “Show it to ‘em” is the creed of the cinema, and Stone,

though not a Bergman, got us involved.

In his last two films, The Doors and JFK, Stone has begun to shift emphasis. From
grandiose, bombastic monologue to grandiose, bombastic monologue, Stone soliloquizes
on the ’60s. He reiterates time and again basic stuff: the atrocity of conspiracy, the awfulness

of lawlessness, the hypocrisy of democracy  starts to wear on you, huh?

From Kevin Costner to Donald Sutherland to Joe Pesci (all of whom are in the film),
something is missing. Stone uses the director’s chair like a pulpit. We are not allowed
participation, not permitted interaction. In this respect, we start to segue out of the realm of cinema

and into that of the editorial.

The scenes in Dallas —— twisting alongthe serpentine road, a little smoke off. to the side, sounds not
quite distinguishable; this is what great movies are made of. With Kennedy and Castro and Vietnam, the:

drama is there. In-depth posrulation deﬂates it.

Being a member of the dreaded Reagan generation, it really isn’t my place to hypothesize on my parents’
coming of age. I know that Stone, as a child of the ’60s and a Vietnam veteran, is possessive of deep-seated

emotional currents I could not begin to relate to.

Still, I think it would do Stone well toilook at another greatdirector of his time: Alan Pakula. Both All
The Presidents Men and The Parallax View touch upon similar ideas of conspiracy, corruption, cover- '
up, etc. The difference is in the execution. With Pakula, viewers find themselves deftly propelled

and thus entranced. JFK felt more like a lecture.

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

Once again submerging himself in the
’60s era, director Ollie Stone has created a
three-hour—plus voyage through every
possible conspiracy tied to the assassination
of John F. Kennedy. Using former New
Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison
(played by Kevin Costner) as his vehicle,
Stone bombards the viewer with a host of
characters and ideas, all with various
reasons for killing Kennedy.

The film is a well-researched script
based on the 1988 book by Garrison, On

The Trail Of The Assassins, and Crossﬁre.-

The Plot That Killed Kennedyby Jim Marrs. A

JFK chronicles Garrison's late-’60s
investigation into the assassination and
his subsequent prosecution of New Orleans
businessman Clay Shaw for conspiracy to
murder. The film also utilizes other
information which has surfaced in the past
two decades, including material from the
investigation by the House Select
Committee on assassinations.

Stone webs fact, fiction, belief and theory
into his rapid camera lens, making one of
the longest, drawn out, hyped whodunits
of all time. From the beginning the pace is
frantic; Kennedy’s slaying takes place
within the first 10 minutes. Stone uses
reels of Walter Cronkite’s live television

   

announcement of the murder and footage
of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by
Jack Ruby to add to his believable scenario,
which reads the assassination as a blatant

yet overlooked (thanks to “patsy” Oswald) ~

coup d’etat by some forces in our
government.

Let’s not pretend that Stone doesn't
know ‘what he’s doing. He is a master
weaver who knows his audience and
knows how to draw reaction from them
and the press, For instance, as Costner and
his law cronies watch Oswald receive a
bullet to the gut, courtesy of Ruby, someone
quips, “Looks like someone just saved the
Dallas DA a pile of work." Not exactly

\your first reaction to watching someone
get plugged on national television, right?
Sure, unless your thinking conspiracy,
which was not the case days after Kennedy
got it. But in Stone’s world the story is
different, and he makes sure we see it.

I certainly don’t know who shot
Kennedy, and I don’t know that JFK has
done anything to show me who was
responsible, although it did strengthen my
belief that Oswald as a lone, crazed Commie
wasn't responsible. Apparently the

‘Stone’-co smoking gun

American public feels the same way; 73
percent don’t believe the Warren report.
Much of this is due to the media, which are
fascinated with the whole spiel. And now
here comes our new American hero
storyteller, wrapped_in his ’60s psyche and
his broad-brush techniques, with the
answers.

With a budget of nearly $40 million,
Stone goes to great lengths (190 minutes
worth) to prove his point. He isn't
concerned with who did the shooting, but
he is concerned with why it was done.
Stone delves into Oswald's past and the

I Cuban missile crisis and drops Donald

Sutherland in as an ex-Black Operations
government official to show that Kennedy
was wanted by countless folks. This keeps
the conspiracy theory going. If so many
wanted him dead, there are sure to be
countless reasons why he got it. ’

For the first two and a half hours, the
film has an overblown documentary feel
with glamour boy Costner (Stone says he
cast him because he represents traditional
American beliefs) and his lawmen
reworking the case from more angles than

‘ Minnesota Fats on the billiards table. For

: . - I ‘ ~ . ’.

the most part this is acceptable (if you can
cope with Stone’s absolute good and evil
themes) until he turns it into pure
Hollywood. For some reason, he needed

to develop the characters of Costner’s'

family and show the struggles he has with
his wife (Sissy Spacek). This becomes trite
— more good-versus-evil battles. --Also,
Stone doesn't hesitate to pan some blatant

cheese shots, like Costner at Kennedy’s .
grave with an elderly black man and his_

grandson. When a scene like this should
be radiating power and emotion, it only
stinks of corniness because of Stone’s
blatant prey on emotions.

The last 40 minutes are all Costner and
the trial of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones),
and much of it is grueling and already
touched upon. For all it's worth (more ’60s
lingo), JFK could have been an hour
shorter and shied away from Hollywood's
big-budget hype syndrome, of whichstone,
as counterculture as he perpetrates to be,
is a firm user. There are no doubt countless

documentaries that are just as gripping .

and not as superﬂuous. Still, Stone did his
research, and some credit must be given
for the lengths he has taken to recreate the
events. As Gary Indiana said in his Village
Voice column, “If it does nothing else,
Stone’s film will at least teach a fresh
generation’ of video renters that nothing
bad sort of happens in America.”

None of the characters say

He was referring to a trio of
short, wordless plays: Samuel

Walker also directs Tuesday,
which reduces the intricate

By Denise Rosensthiel
For The Pitt News

For those of you still struggling
with testosterone—pumped media
coverage of the ﬁlm JFK and
wondering which TV show,
magazine or newspaper to
believe, the answer is: Don’t
believe any of them. Malee up your
own mind. You either want to
see it, or you don’t.

Hardly hasthere been such
tnith—controversy over a ﬁlm since
Citizen Kane in the 19403. The
interesting thing about the
immense hype from the media
over this ﬁlm is that director Oliver
Stone has, in their eyes,
overstepped the bounds from
telling stories to reporting the
truth, which is what the media
charades.

Stone, who broke into the
commercial-cinema scene in the
early '80s with Platoon and
subsequently basked in the praise
from various communities (mostly
the Vietnam vets), has become

one of his own anti-heroes a
decade later.

One must understand that
Stone -has put as much
passionate research into the JFK
project as the general media has
fire and brimstone. But
conservative journalism
insinuates that Stone’s research
is pure fantasy. In December,
the headline of the supposedly
unbiased Newsweeleﬂared, “THE
TWISTED TRUTH OF JFK: WHY
OLIVER STONE’S NEW MOVIE
CAN ’T BE TRUST ED.” And
within, the article reads, “JFK is
not just entertainment; it’s a
work of propaganda.” As if the
media were innocent of such a
sin and weren’t really branding

. Power pop galore: Bone of Contenti

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

There’s a new revival taking
place within the underground
world of music these days, and its
theme is as old as mo’ earth
herself. Yes, love rock has
surfaced again, and it’s wetter
than a Depends bag. Pittsburgh
has been treated to a shindig of
campy love groups lately,
culminating with last week’s
Unrest/Eggs show at the Beehive
in Oakland.

This week offers more goodies,
as Pittsburgh’s own lovelies in

on and Poster Children

Bone Of Contention unveil a hot, ' I

steamy, new 7-inch courtesy of
its own Igor record label. It's real
easy to get a copy for your starving
tables because the Bone will hold
the now-infamous record-release
party ——- or in this case a single-
release gig — at the Upstage
Lounge. Alright, so the Bone isn't
really at the forefront of the love
revival, but it does make soothing

jangle-filled pop that you can‘

make love to. The new wax,

aptly titled “Sludge Creek b/w

Harmless” is the first recording

with guitarist Bart Wise, although

he’s been slinging the axe with

I the group for almost a year.

An added attraction is the
Pittsburgh debut of The Pundits,
featuring Kip Ruéﬂe of ATS on
drums, the elder John Bell on
guitar, the Bone’s own Mike
Shanley on bass and Mr. Love
Ballad himself, John Young, on
guitar and vocals. Rumor has it
that the members of the Pundits
will attack in the same power-
pop mold that Big Dipper and
other mid-’80s, Homestead-label
bands did. But, more importantly,
the show with Bone of Contention
is a chance to see guru Shanley
ﬂail his bass in two bands in the
same night. No sleep ‘til Friday.

Also approaching is the Poster
Children, a Minnesota band which
has scored twice on the Twin/
Tone label and has recently

‘YEAR ...... __

dropped its latest offering, Daisy
Chain Reaction. The LP, a fine
blend of noise and pop, proves
that the band is intelligent and
surprisingly refreshing. From a
jangly number like “Water” to the
hypnotic swirl of “Chain
Reaction,” the melodic churn of
“Where We Live” or even the

brilliant funk/scream of “If You

See Kay,” Poster Children comes
off sounding like a revved-up
pastry truck. It's poppy as heck to
boot, and if Nirvana’s grind is
becoming top—lO vogue, there is
no reason these guys and one gal
shouldn't be seeing AOR play as
well. Since there is a song named
“Love” on the record, it’s OK to
throw the Children into the new
rage. Plus, it sounds like a tighter
Teen Beat band.

does Drescher get the message
out’

“If kids have anything to say,
they definitely know that there’s
an open forum when Murphy’s
Law plays. People can say
whatever they want; the
microphone ’s open, and they can
definitely speak their views or

advertise their band’s shows or

whatever. It’s a free country,”
Drescher said.

What about those dancing beer
cans, anyway? That seems to be
more along the lines of what
you'd expect from Murphy’s Law
if you’ve listened to its newest
release on Relativity Records, The
Best Of Times. When you listen to
it, it’s hard to pick out the political
songs. Yet they are there.

“We do fun songs and have a
great time, and in the midst of it
we’ll pop in a comment here-or

RYONE IS WELCOME
NO FEE

there that will sink in because
people are having fun,” Drescher
said.

As for the beer cans, they were
two kids who had dressed up for
Halloween and come up on stage
to dance. The funny thing was
that they cut their eye holes in the
wrong side of the cans, and
instead of dancing, they bumped
into each other (and the band) all
night. Anyone want to do it up
right? There’s a spot on stage
waiting for you.

antics to the Graﬂitt in Oakland
