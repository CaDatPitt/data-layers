Cement Research Resul

t

BY JOHN De NINNO
Third ofa series
A dry pre-mix mortar ce—
ment for underground coal
mines has been developed

Edward Allen Dines, .head
of the department of mines, after
experimenting and doing research
on a possible mixture that would
mean more economy and greater
efﬁciency in mining work has de-
veloped a mortar mix which he
calls “Mix-Quix.”

Research Projects Underway

It is only one of several research
programs n o w ’

—University’s
School of Engi-
neering and
Mines. .

B e c a u s e f

mining center,§
this mortar mix -
developed by.
Prof. Dines is 
particularly im
portant for use here.

In the underground mines a
large amount of the brick and
block laying is done for general
construction and in building stop-
pings for ventilation. At present,
there is great diﬂ’iculty=in trans-
porting and handling all the ma-
terials ’ necessary for such con-
struction, according to Prof. Dines.

Another- disadvantage in the
present system is that much ce-
ment used in constructions become
useless, since the sacks in whic_h it
comes are not moisture proof and
the cement becomes hard due to
underground moisture. The bags
also break easily causing a good
deal of waste. .This becomes cost-

   

Mix Quix Lessens Time
c To decrease work required to

    Mix-Ouix Developed’  

mix sand, cement, and water and
to eliminate much ’ wasted time
transporting these materials from
the surface to underground mines,
Prof. Dines developed the ‘ready
mix mortar cement.

A bag that is both moisture re-
sistant and break-proof will hold
the mix. '

Ingredients of “Mix-Quix” are
cement (including 3 per cent gyp-

sum), . limestone, powdered asbes-

tos, and oven-dried sand.

To determine the time saved by
utilizing the ready mix mortar ce-
ment, time studies were ’ made.
These are scientiﬁc measurements
used to determines the time an
average worker should take to
performa given task. It was found
that the Dines method practically
cut mortar mixing time in half.

Saves Money, Too

Cost‘ is bf prime importance to
industry. With use of this mix,
according to Prof. Dines,"a perma-
nent (used for over a year) block
stopping will cost $3.21 less than
the present method of construct-
ing a stopping. Since hundreds of
stoppings are necessary for ade-
quate ventilation in a mine, the
amount saved is not inconsequen-
tial._ It amounts to a minumum of
$10 per day wor an average mine.

“Mix-Quix” is more ﬁre-proof
than existing cements used in un-
derground mining. Fires in _mines
can be disastrous. When a ﬁre
starts in a‘mine, the area on ﬁre
must be blocked up. Using the old
method of mixing cement, the time
wasted could sometimes result in
the loss of lives. Prof. Dines feels
that his mortar mix will save vital

time in this emergency use.

The new mortar mix will soon
be proved in actual use‘. Pitts-
burgh Consolidation Coal Com-
pany has ordered 50 seventy-
pound sacks of Prof. Dines’ prod-
uct. .

MTouch,ofEnglanll Here
In ‘The Male Animal’

‘Pitt Players second_ production of the year,.‘.‘The Male
Animal,” will feature a student studying here from England‘

when staged in Stephen Fost
and 12.

er Memorial on Dec. 10, 11,

Maurice Haidaker, from King’s College, University of

Durham, England will have the
role of “Dean Damon.”

“The Male Animal” by James
Thurber and Elliott Nugent, is
primarily a ‘comedy of life in a
mid-western college town, the
foibles of faculty members and
their families, the philistinism of
trustees who care more about foot-
ball stadiums than scholarships,
and the.,absurdities of undergrad-
uate courtships. But underlying
this is a serious theme: academic
freedom. ‘~ ‘

“The Male Animal” was a-
Broadway success ‘when. ﬁrst pro-
duced in, 1940, and repeated its
success in 1953, in a revival at the
New York Center.. Mr. Nugent
played his original role of Profes-
sor Tommy Turner, co-starring

ner, and’ Robert Preston as Joe
Ferguson. . ~ 

The revival was scheduled for
a two-week run, but the press and-
public received it so favorably
that it remained much longer.

Sigma Chi Collects
Most of; the Cans
T Interfraternity Council’s canned

goods drive closed last Wednes-
day with Sigma Chi winning ﬁrst

According to Emil Herman,

chairman of IF Special Projects-

committee, the results are not ﬁn-
al, but the total number is expect-
ed to equal last year’s ﬁnal count
of 4,000 cans.

The d riv e_ was conducted

By IRV ROTHMAN .

The newly-formed Council of Scholastic Organizations
has received such widespread interest from both faculty and

students, that it has now been established as an autonomous.

Inter—Honorary Council. Previous to the change it existed

as a project of the Academic

The decision to put the council
on it’s own two feet was made
at a joint meeting of the Aca-
demic Promotions Committee and
the CS0, Nov. 20.

Efforts have been continuously
made at Pitt to organize the hon-

- oraries, but until this year all at-

tempts were made to organize both
graduate and undergrad scholastic

, groups into one Council. This time

only undergraduate societies are
involved.

High Academic Requirements

Membership requirements ar e
high for the
group. All member—honorarie’s'
must require of their members a
2.00 Q.P.A. in all their college
work, in addition to the ﬁeld to
which they were tapped. '

Steven C. Beering, prof-tempore
chairman has stated that it is im-
portant for all honoraries to main-
tain high academic requirements
for, “It is the purpose of honor-
aries to make the students come
up to their level.”

Under those provisions, there
are eighteen eligible groups’ on
campus. Of those, nine are rep-

resented at Council. The other

nine are not functioning at the
present time. However, it is the
intention of CS0‘ to aid in the
reorganization of these defunct
groups. ,
Four-Point Program

CS0 has adopted a four-fold
program of service, morale, com-
municative, and eventually social
signiﬁcance. ~

Along the service phase, the or-
ganization will promote such in-
terest gr'oups as the Humanities
Society as well as educational lec-
tures and motion pictures.

tMerit Recognition

Omicron Delta~Kappa and Druids tappees are named
today in this issue of the News and we would like to add.
our congratulations to the honored people. While some
people may doubt the Value of -these recognition ‘societies
and_ the goals they represent, the spirited qualities
which they rewardiare the powers that furnishithe progress
of the University in the undergraduate body. In addition

to citing scholarship ability, these honoraries foster and en-
courage leadership in extra curricular work and recognize

students who have proven themselves to_ be outstanding
members of the University. Faculty andadministration per-
sonnel who are honored by these societies might also pause
to reflect on their awards. They are chosen because of
their recognized abilities andtheir sincere desire to give

,that added measure of value to their work as teachers of

th students. N o doubt the salary checks are welcome reward
‘for their efforts in the ﬁeld but the real judges of their abili-
ty are the students who are the keenest critics of the quality
of their work. When they recognize only a» few of the many

who seek 'to instruct them, it is a mark of sincere respect

and.honest thanks, and a reward not to be taken ‘lightly.

We’re living in a generation of escape artists,

Kids who don’t want to be John Wayne or who

don’t want to climb the Matterhorn can buy 3-D

Captain Oleo, or Howdy Gooney.

The 3-D phenomenon is fascinating, but the’

whole idea is a little too close for comfort to Aldous
Huxley’s “BraveLNew World.”

f _In this novel about future life on earth'(whe,n
babies would be hatched, and mother woul.d be-
come a dirty word), Huxley ‘described “feelies,"

pressed while June Allyson kissed Dick Powell,
the movie-goer would get a buss. Similarly, he’d
get a sock in the jaw if he pressed the button dur-
ing a free-for—al1 ﬁght.

Is the advance in escape phenomena simply a.

Finally, why do we want to escape? Granted,
there are some for whom life is gray, but that

‘people feel a need for escaping from reality?‘

may very well be the most cul-

The term culture may strike
you as being a little highbrow
but it ain’t necessarily so. To be-
gin at the beginning, there are
the Pitt Players, an energetic
group of students who present a
series of plays during the year
ranging from Shaw to Thurber.
You may consider a play by Bill
Shakespeare too highbrow for
your liking but if James Thurber
is highbrow, may the Pirates win
the ' pennant next season. The
Players run the gamut from trag-

Your editorial on the “Right
Kind of Education” appearing in
the, November 20th issue of the

very much. I am in complete
agreement with the point that an
education is not to be had in the
classroom alone. However, I am

in complete disagreement with
the statements‘ by Mrs. M. C.

‘- McIntosh which you quoted in

the. editorial. Her idea, and I
suppose it is yours too, that “a
young man who has only tech‘-
nical knowledgeﬂwill have no

democracy” is absurd. If this
were true, then what of the mil-
lions of people who have no ed-
ucation at all (not counting the

poor technical stud.ents)f.’ ,How.

in the world will they ever learn

many have heard RachmaninoiT’s

mention of a symphony orches-

Nixon, Hos Possibilities

By designating a small amount
of time to the symphony, you
gain the opportunity to see and
hear contemporary musicians
who will, in a matter of years,
be ranked with the great artists
of the past. One such man, Wil-
liam Kapell, was illed last week
in ~a, plane crash. id you pass up
the Aopportunity to see and hear
this artist during his last appear-

ance with the Pittsburgh Sym- .

The Nixon Theater affords not
only some of the best plays of
the season but also some of the
best—known personalities of the

stage and screen. The Civic Light.

during the summer in presenting

Things get a little tougher at
the Carnegie Museum since you
must walkrather than sit. As an
added note of interest, you.might

And how about the statement

is a shock to ﬁnd that a technical

it’s just the lack of a “liberal”

V versity,

, pation in the intramural program

 

By JIM D'eVVEESE

Pittsburgh’s YMCA is com-
memorating it’s 99th anniver-
sary this year while the Uni-
v-ersity’s branch celebrates its
47th year at Pitt.

“The Y strives within the frame‘-
work of the University program
to meet the needs of men students,
to encourage responsibility and
participation in student life, and
to prepare its members for a well
rounded life based on Christian
principles,” states Executive Sec
retary Alfred C. Payne. ~ .

It was in 1906 that Dr. Samuel
Linhart, then secretary of the Uni-
undertook to sponser a
branch oi the Y at Pitt. The Y
has come a long way in its 47
years at Pitt as evidenced by its
diversiﬁed program.

Camp Most Familiar

The most familiar activity is
Freshman Camp. This consists of
a week—end at Camp Kon-O—Kwee
which gives the freshman an op-
portunity to know his school as
well as his future classmates.

The Campus Religion-in-Life
program, ‘founded by the Y and
held each spring, brings to Pitt
theologians of international fame
who talk to theestudents on a se-
lected theme which is ofgnajor im-
portance to college students.

Sponsors UN ‘Week ,

United Nations Week, is an-
other of the Y’s activities. This
program has, as its key’ event, a
mock UN session and a trip to the
New York headquarters. This ac-
tivity is dedicated to World Broth-
erhood and is climaxed by a tour
of Manhattan. ,

Athletics, play a vital part in
the Y’s activity program. Partici-

of the*University, is encouraged.
A number of social activities are
sponsored annually by the Y in-
cluding picnics, Christmas parties,

and a square dance planned joint. _

ly with the YWCA.

. Liu Heads Project

Currently, Dr. James T. C. Liu
is heading a project called “intel-
_ligent'c'onversation.” He stresses
the philosophical approach by of-
fering for group discussion, such
questionsas, “Who are we?”, and‘
‘What are we doing?’’. This pro-
gram is designed to cause the stu-
dent to reﬂect op fundamental is- _
sues which’are so often lost amidst
current events. .

Commemorating its anniversary,
the Y held abarn dance last Tues-
day in conjunction with the
YWCA. Today the Y is holding its
annual convocation service in
Heinz Chapel for student leaders
of Hi-Y clubs in area high schools.

At Testimonial

Dr. H." C.>(Doc) Carlson, who
retired last spring as head basket-
ball coach at Pitt after 31 years,
will be honored tonight at a uni-
que testimonial dinner at Webster

Many of .the friends Carlson
made during his tenure as coach
will be present to relate incidents
about his fabulous career. There
will be no main speaker but Rege
Cordic will act as master of cere-

over the nation and from many
businesses and professions will
form most of the expected attend-
ance of 200. I

ter as part of the program. The
presentations will be silver trays
autographed by all the guests at
the banquet.

champion squads plan to be at the

ceremony. They were the 1927-28
team which won all its games and
the 1929-30 team which lost but
two of 25 tilts.

Inexperience and Height
Hamper New Head Man

Red Dawson thought he had a tough job when he started
coaching this past year’s inexperienced football team, but
his fellow mentor, Bob Timmons, faces a similar bpt tougher

Timmons, ‘successor to Dr. H. C. Carlson, returns to
coaching basketball after a ten-year lapse, inheriting a squad

that has only two regulars of foul:

lettermen back. ,

Add to this that height—a neces- I
sity in top-ﬂight teams--will also
be scarce and local fans can see
that‘ Timmons’ team will not ﬁnd
it easy to equal last year’s 12-11
record.

(6-0) is the only regular from the
last Doc Carlson production and he
will be expected to carry the bulk

of the 11.8 average he maintained
last winter. -

Other probable starters include
junior forward Ed Pavlick (6-3),

Student Has
Bone To “Pick

83' RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

  

While it is hoped that outsiders who stumble across this page do
not get the idea that the student body is out-after our football coach’s
scalp, it may be well to air some of the dissatisfaction ‘that has
cropped up in the wake of this year’s poor showing on the gridiron.

, Here is a letter that one outspoken student brought in to the
desk, insisting that it be printed in keeping with the News policy
of expressing what the students are ‘thinking and saying:

‘ Dear Mr. Dawson, 1

With nothing -much more to do on Thanksgiving Day but
sit around and, burp and think, I got to thinking about our '
lousy football ’season. It made me slightly sick as it probably

‘ made countless other students at Pitt, but here is what I thought,
in case you’re interested. And you should be, because it is our
football team. That’s something you should always keep in mind,
_Mr. Dawson. p . .

In making these statements, I think I am reflecting some
of the current opinions, judging from comments heard from other
students. ,  '

As a football coachtyou probably want your players to be
sure of themselves. This pastseason you were one heck of an
example for your boys to follow, Coach. It took you four games
to decide who was going to be your quarterback. You never
did decide on a starting backﬁeld and you discovered yourV“hid-
den talent” at the very end of the season. '

What I’m getting at is that if you expect your team to be
sure of themselves you must be somewhat sure of yourself. Lets
pick a lineup and stick with it for a few weeks, anyhow.

Let’s go out next year with the idea of winning. a game and
not holding the score down. If this requires taking a few chances,
let’s do it. What is the difference if we lose by one point or

C seven points? ' .

You are still coach, Mr. Dawson, so how about acting like
one. VVhen you make up your mind, stick to it. Don’t be con-
servative—-football ‘isn’t a conservative game. And on Thanks-
giving. day, Mr. Dawson, I hope you were thankful you were -
coaching Pitt and not-a team like Ohio State, which doesn’t kee
losers around. ' ’

John Ney

» College ’54.

This sort of reaction is what might have been expected after‘ a
losing season——the poor coach has to take it on the chin. ,

Be assured that whatever lineup changes Dawson made were not
effected haphazardly, but out of a desperate attempt to, ﬁnd a com-
bination that could strike with consistency.‘

Rather than second-guessing and mentally replaying the games
lost, it would be advisable to wait until Dawson has had time to in-
stall his own system of football—three years is often considered to
be the minimum in grid circles.

You ate too much, Mr’. Ney.

is being reorganized to assure
compactness.

All-Campus tumbling and gym-
nastics meetings get under way in
the middle of the month, and the
entry deadline is set for Dec. 14.
Those planning to participate may
apply at the Field House and work

In -volleyball, twelve teams are
set for fraternity competition,
which begins today. The team
squash tournament is already in
progress.

Basketball will begin for the in-

ftramural athletes at the beginning

of the spring semester.

The ﬁnal Medico pipe set
winner for this season was
Ken Krapf, electrical engi-
neering student, of 2039 Chal-

_fant St., Pittsburgh 21, Pa.

‘Quite a few of the entries
missed only one victory, and
none, naturally, could predict
the three ties in the list) of
games. The winner's scores,
however, matched the results
of the games more closely than
any of these others. The Med-

“Why were you fight-

A "Well, I was in a tele-

‘told her that thanks to the revolutionary new process, called
“Hellerized,” they are completely washable.”

“Yes,” said the Dean.

“Then I told her that the knit fabric felt like ﬁne cash-

handsome new colors I picked out, and that they cost only
$0.00 apiece. And I was just about to tell her that I loved
her, when a senior suddenly wanted to use the telephone. I-le
open the door, grabbed me by the neck, and threw me‘
