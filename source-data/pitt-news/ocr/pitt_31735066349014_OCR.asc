Student emp1oyes and a manager at work in the Burger Chef kitchen.
Most workers at Burger _Chef and the Towers cafeteria said
unionization is not. the answer to their labor problems.

BY DENNIS KELLY .
The socio-economic status of

Pitt students has risen since 1970, '

but is ,still substantially below
national norms, Pitt’s Ofﬁce of
Institutional Research and Plan-
ning Studies (IRPS) recently
announced. '

The median undergraduate fami-
ly income at Pitt in 1974 was
$13,103, more than $3,000 less
than the national ﬁgure released by
Diane Palmer, staff associate for

;sn,1RPS.

Families of public university
freshmen nationally having in-
comes of more than $20,000 was
36.3%, nearly‘ twice that of Pitt
undergraduates (18.2%). Corre-
spondingly, fewer public university
families are found at the lowest
income level--national 4.9%; Pitt
6.1%.

Both the mothers and the fathers
students have more
education than in past years, and
the percentage of fathers holding
blue-collar jobs has declined.

Pitt differed from the national
norm by showing a decrease in the
percentage of ﬁrst-generation col-

lege students, 67.6% down to
60.9%. '

A ﬁrst-generation student is one
in the ﬁrst college-educated gen-
eration of his family.

For the same period nationally,
the ﬁgures were 44.9% and 42.3%
respectively.

There was a decline in “rea ” 9

constant dollar median income for,
all Pitt undergraduates, according
to IRPS, but this decline was less
steep than the national average.

The median family income
($13,103) was 22.8% higher than
1970, but in real median income it
represented a 3.3% decrease.
median inc-come it represented a
3.3% decrease.

Nationally, public university
freshmen had a median parental
income of $16,250 in 1974, 19.6%
higher than in 1970, but thereal
median income dropped 5.8%.

“The. most interesting change
occurred in the engineering
school,’.’ Palmer said. “Engineer-
ing was the only school in which
constant dollar (corrected to 1967
dollars) median income rose.”

In 1970, the median income of

Students Opposed to Union ~

BY JIM SZYMECKI

Students employed in campus
food-service jobs generally are
opposed to unionization, according
to a recent Pitt News survey.

The survey was conducted in
response _to a suggestion by
Student Government President
Larry Platt that student employes

should consider unionization if they-

felt they were being exploited by
the food service operations. '
Fifteen ‘of .24 student workers

‘’ interviewed at the Burger Chef

fast-food restaurant in the Cathe-
dral -basement and the Towers
cafeteria said they did not think
unionization was a good idea. Six
thought unionization was an
answer to theirneeds, and three
were undecided.

ployes.

(Continued on Page 3)

_All students asked to remain
unidentiﬁed.

The students who said they
would support a union at Burger
Chef in many cases had no major
complaints. Those who did com-
plain usually mentioned manage-
ment treatment and late pay
checks.

A senior English major, when
asked if he got his pay on time,
answered, “Not initially.” When
asked if he felt the new
management was taking care of the
problem, he said, “I don’t have
much conﬁdence in them. They
seem screwy.”

He added that the managers treat
student employes like children.

Most students who favored.
unionization said they »did so.
because they agree with _the
principles of unions. .

‘The students who opposed a
union at Burger Chef did so
because they said they thought a
union would be ineffective. “Most
people just want to get a little
extra; they don’t care enough to
start a union,"’ a senior bio-chem-
istry major said.

Others said they thought a union

was unnecessary. - _

At the cafeteria, almost every
worker was opposed to unioniza-
tion. Some consider a union
impractical.

A senior ticket checker said, “I
think it would be superﬂuous,
because of the turnover of
students. It would be lost money.’

Rape in Tower B Room

An Oakland woman reported she
was raped Sunday evening on the
sixth floor of Tower B, according to
City Police."

The alleged victim claimed that a
student escorted her. to his room,
where she was ‘raped by four men,
police said.

According to police, she was

taken to Magee-Womens Hospital
following the alleged rape, and
then released. 4 *

Campus Police said they were
investigating the report but offered
no details.

They reported, though, that the

alleged victim had. withdrawn

charges against the men.

Though they opposed unioniza-

tion, the cafeteriaworkerstﬁstill had ‘
some gripes. The biggest com-2

plaint was that the managers felt
very little restraint‘ in, firing
students. ’ .

“You can’t bitch about it,” a

senior» economics‘ major ‘said,
talking about pay, “because
can always be replaced.”

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

The University ‘has caused ﬁnancial hardships by

withholding refunds on tuition payments, according to .

several students who complained about recent delays oi
payments due them from the Office of Student Accounts.

One student complained he had paid "his tuition in full
while awaiting a veriﬁcation of his pending Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA( scholar-
shi .

When he received veriﬁcation via a letter, he took it to
Student Accounts. The letter that proved he had been
awarded money was “not good enough," according to the
student. He found it nearly impossible to collect the money
(over $400).

Another student complained that the delay in refund was

"“‘unusually hard” on him, since he is now delinquent in his

rent and found it hard to cover book costs and other
expenses. A _ ‘ . * V

« A commuter found the delay. in refundsvhas raised many
problems with ﬁnancing commuting costs. ' '

Another student said he made so many trips to Student '

Accounts to ﬁnd out about the refund without getting any
action that it all seemed futile. '

A delay on the ofﬁcial notiﬁcation from PHEAA is
responsible for the delay on student refunds, according to
Manager of Student Accounts James N. Beavers.

“We received a notiﬁcation in July that covered about

5,000 students,” Beavers: said. “However,_since then
there has been additional aid awarded.

“Another ofﬁcial notification was sent to Student
Accounts about two weeks ago, but there was an error
within it,” Beavers said. “It was a problem of processing
by PHEAA and we couldn’t determine which was the latest
award." ' -

Student Accounts requested another tape of the ofﬁcial
notiﬁcation of awards, Beavers said.

“We have no definite time schedule as to when that will
come," he added. , ,

Concerning students.’ immediate needs for refunds,
Beavers said, “Normally we don’t give refunds until the
individual accounds show credit equal to the award.”

refunds without prior ofﬁcial notiﬁcation from the state, .
according to Beavers.

“We are now in the process of overriding notiﬁcation or
credit,” Beavers said. “Each individual refund has tobe
looked at by a staff member to see what the problem is, and
that takes time.” , --

Beavers said he had assigned at least three. full-t_im'e
staff members to that job. V ' ‘

Checks for refunds are being mailed out now, according
to Beavers. “We are trying to get this done as quickly as
possible," he said. ‘

Beavers speciﬁed that these refunds are involving
scholarships and grants. ~ '

“We can't override loans because the student has to sign
a legal promissory document and submit that,” Beavers
said. “Once that document is submitted, then it carlbe
taken care of." -

"Any combination of loans and scholarships concerning
refunds is likely to run- into problems, Beavers said.

He added. that he hopes ofﬁcial notiﬁcation will be
received from PHEAA soon, resulting in full refunds for

FATAL BOMBTRACED HERE

US Postal Service ofﬁcials say
they are looking‘ for a young
woman, possibly a go-go dancer,
who they believe mailed from
Oakland a fragmentation bomb that
killed a Canadian man and injured
his wife and son.

A drawing based on. the
description given by a post office
clerk at the Oakland 4, station on
Meyran Avenue was circulated late
Tuesday and authorities said they
were looking for “an attractive
brunette, between 25 and 35 years,
possibly a go-go" dancer."

. A bomb in an attache case
containing nails, glass and broken
washers was sent in a package
marked “literature" from Pitts-
burgh to Vancouver, BC.

The device was riggedto go off
instantaneously and it exploded
Sunday in the home of George
Chatzispiros, 42, a former Vancou-
ver restauranteur. It had been
mailed to Chatzispiros’ 20-year-old
son, William, who was not at home
when the package was delivered.

Court May
Grant Lennon
Stay in US

NEW YORK AP - The US
Court of Appeals reversed Tuesday
a deportation order for former
Beatle John Lennon and directed

"reconsideration of his effort to gain

permanent residence in the United
States.

The order itself had been shelved
two weeks ago by the Immigration.

and Naturalization Service on 1

humanitarian grounds because
Lennon’s wife was pregnant, but
action on the order could have been
resumed at any time.

-Today’s 2-1 decision held that
Lennon’s 1968 British conviction
for possession of hashish, found in

a binocular case, does not make the ,

sinlgeran excludable- alien, as the
Board of Immigration Appeals had
ruled.

The court majority vacated the‘
denial of Lennon’s~application for

permanent residence and the»

deportation order. It -sent the
matter back, to the board for
“reconsideration in accordance
with the views expressed in this
opinion.” ' ~ « <
Last September 23, the Immigra-
tion ‘Service had stayed the order
onthe basis of a medical affidavit

- that said Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, .

would be in jeopardy if she were
moved at this time or if her
husband were forced to leave the
country without her. She has
permanent resident alien status
here.

“ Any return to students through negotiations would be strictly

With the four phones, there is hardly any wait to make a call on the

placed on‘ the wall at eye-level.

The immediate beneﬁt is convenience for students using the phones.

congestion that surrounded their work area when the phone sat on the

Putting Pressure on Racism

BY BILL KALMAN

‘It is a well-established fact that
racism permeates all institutions in
American- society. Recently, how-
ever,- this racism has been
strengthened. Racists throughout
the country have been emboldened
by President Ford’s anti-busing
statements, and by the inaction of
the federal, state and_ local
governments to protect blacks in
Louisville, Prince Georges county
and Boston. '

In response to this racist
offensive, large numbers of people
have begun to organize to defend
the gains made by the black
movement.

For example, this weekend

-hundreds of students from across

the country will attend the second
National Student Conference
Against Racism. Two busloads of
students from Pitt will also be
leaving for the conference.

One of the main topics of the
conference will be the school
desegregation ﬁght in Boston.
According to Maceo Dixon, a
spokesperson for- the National
Student, Coalition Against Racism,

“The struggle for peaceful imple-

activities-of the racist anti-busing-
forces in this city...has proven they
are determined to continue their
attacks on the rights of black
students to receive an equal
education.’ ’

Dixon then told of an incident in
Charlestown, a stronghold of racist
opposition to school desegregation,
where a gang of white thugs chased
and beat a black student at Bunker
Hill Community College. Not one of
the gang was ever arrested,

. although they were identified b

over a dozen witnesses.

“It will take the mobilization of
thousands of supporters of dese-
gregation to defeat the racists and_
their reactionary anti-busing
movement," Dixon explained.
“Legal and peaceful actions in
support of busing must be
organized to isolate and demoralize
the ranks of the racist movement.
These actions can bring full
pressure on the city, state and
federal governments to enforce the
law."

The conference will open with a
symposium on “Civil Rights and
Racism.” Featured speakers at the
symposium will include Robert
Allen, of Black Scholar magazine;

community to self-defense; Thom-
as Atkins, president of the Boston
NAACP; Jonathon Kozol, author of
the award-winning Death at an
Early Age; and Jerry Paul and
Karen Galloway, chief attorneys in
the Joanne Little case.

Workshops and discussions at
the conference will focus on many
aspects of racist oppression,
including police brutality, budget
cutbacks, defense of political
prisoners and discriminatory lay-
offs.

As Dixon put it, “We have to go
out and show the world that the
racist movement speaks for only a
small minority of the human race."

Passing the Buck
On SGB Funds

At the Student Government
Board meeting on October 1, Board
member Mark Satinoff requested
the board vote funding for student
bus trips to the National Student
Coalition Against Racism Confer-

ence in Boston. The Board referred’
Alloca- -
tions Committee. * . 1

thefunding matter to -the

The Board’s action was at best a

l delaying tactic, when the true
"answer to the request isgreadily‘
- clear to anyone ‘with even. the most

basic knowledge of the rules of _

Allocations of Student Activities.
‘These are the reasons why no

funding should be given forthis

program: _ ‘ ’

1. The Coalition Against Racism
is not. a recognized student
organization.
organizations are eligible to receive
supplies, an office_, or funds from
the student activities fee. Despite
this clear-cut rule, the CAR has
been operating out of an ofﬁce in

‘the Student Union, with supplies

‘paid for by your student activities
fee! '

2. Allocations does not fund off
campus conventions. This is flatly
stated in one of the rules of the
Allocations committee. It would be
grossly inconsistent with rulings on

  Letters to the Editor

cial if the CAR recieved the funding
they are requesting.

3. Any student bus trips funded
would be “personal items,”
another item expressly ruled out by
the rules governing allocations of
the activities fee. To fund the affair
in the light of this would be
tantamount to throwing‘ away all
rules governing student organiza-
tions.

So, it is quite clear that the
CAR not-only should not get the

-3 funds they-have requested, but also

. Pitt Young Americans for

show a gross disregard for all rules
and regulations. One would think

that a'Board memberflike Satin0ff,-

would know better.

The Board should have acted as
mandated and refused -to even
consider funding the event._- '

fair procedures on college cam-

tradition was established by
careful attention to the special
needs of college communities.
We decided last week to reject
the "principle of union at any cost,
and not to enter into mergers that
might risk loss of the distinctive
AAUP academic tradition. We
decided to avoid merger with
organizations that have other kinds

Why should the decision to
preserve our established-» role be
regarded as a cause of turmoil?-

May we also comment on your
editorial of September 24. concern-
ing the AAUP/ PITT rejection of an‘

invitation_to participate in Senate ‘

considerations of faculty unioniza-
tion? This was, not caused by
-tim-idity. as you stated. but -by the
recognition that the special format
chosen by the" Senate leadership
seemed like an ‘attempt to enforce
advance agreement among the

parties in a political conflict, as if ‘
' elections and bargaining were not
necessary. The Senate debate on

unionization was to be paid for by
the administration, with an umpire
chosen by the administration. Even
the legalityof such an arrangement
must be questioned.

Lecture Room 4 in Scaife Hall

_ * looks like most other lecture rooms
‘ : on-campus--rows of theater seats

 __climbing up to the ceiling, a

, ' front left-hand corner of the room,
 a‘ skeleton hangs from an Army-
 green locker, ﬁngers and toes

dangling; the large empty eye

“ ‘ sockets staring at the class.

This is a class in Pitt's Medical

one of -130 first-year students.

lecture--first-year med students
don’t have to wear white uniforms"
but .that is the only similarity,
according to Herrmann.

“It's completely different from
undergraduate school. There isn’t
the kind of competition here that
there was in undergrad. We don’t
have any grades--everything is
pass/fail--which relieves some of

the pressure.

“We don’t have to turn in lab
assignments for our classes and
only the ﬁnal exam is used in
determining a passing grade. We
have quizzes about every other
week, but they don’t count. They

(I t
tin-ttt

. are more to give us an idea of what

material .we should be absorbing,,”
Herrmann says.

Med-school students don’t have
a choice in what courses they take.
First-semester students are enrol-
led in biochemistry, histology (cell

biology) and anatomy. Unlike’

undergraduate .school, Herrmann
says, there are no required texts for
courses.

“Professors will suggest texts,
but if we can get the information
from another source, we don’t need
the same books,” she explains.

“I got most of my books used this

term, so I only had to spend about
$100. I also had to buy a
microscope, which I’ll use for two
years. They run about $600, but
the expense is nothing like Dental
School, where students spend over

_ $1,000 a year on books and

equipment.” w

The professor walks into class
wearing a white lab coat over his
clothes.

nated preganglionic fiber. All the

‘V while, he_ sketches diagrams on the
board and as he changes colored

open and closed.
At 10 am, with several pages of

p/*f=_;l,]€1' notebook ﬁlled with colored

":1

’ ‘Jdrawings, Herrmann heads down-

stairs to the library, where she will
read for two hours. Around noon
she joins the white-uniformed
brown baggers on the second ﬂoor.

The cafeteria probably isn’t any ,

cleaner than any other cafeteria,
but it looks that way because of all
the gleaming white outﬁts and
polished shoes.

Spending the day in Scaife is
nothing new to Herrmann.

“I worked in Neurology for a
while on muscular dystrophy
research and I also did my senior’
project for a biology major in
pathology, so I’ve spent a lot of
time in the labs here,” she says.

«*".’~:"~-“I’ve alwaysvbeen interested in
medicine, in biology. For a while I_

was considering veterinary school,
but I decided if I went to med
school I could be more useful.
Many times people are reluctant to
spend the_ money to take care of a
pet and would rather just get
another one, so the vet ends up
doing things like clipping toe-
nails.” ,

At 2 pm Herrmann heads back
up to Lecture Room 4 for anatomy,
followed by a two-hour"1ab.-
Attendance isn’t mandatory in the
labs--the instructor usually just
shows examples of things he

,;/fi-.,»-c_overed during lecture and the

students can go over the materials‘
themselves.

The lab is filled with the stench
of formaldehyde.

In addition to the smell, there are
stools, display cases, students and
tables--tables -with bones piled on
them, tables with sheets over them
and God-knows-what under them.
Herrmann whips a sheet off one of
the tables to reveal a mound of
brownish-red, muscle-like sub-
stance--a, human thorax.

“During demonstration the other
day, I was standing close to the
table and I started to feel faint. It
was from the smell of formalde-
hyde, though,” Herrmann says. “I

guess if you think about -it, you
could be bothered by some of the
things we see, but it doesn't make
me feel ill because I just think it’s
so interesting. You get wrapped up
in it.”

Herrmann has one more lecture
at 4 pm and then sheusually works
in the lab for a while.

“I spend 20 or 25 hours a week‘

up here and usually get home

' around 1.0 or 11 o’clock,” she says.

First-year students don’t spend
any time actually working in
hospitals, but they can sign up to
go around with a physician at a
hospital to get a feel for working
with the patients.

Herrmann is in the MD/PhD
program in the med school and
right now is interested in the
research aspect of medicine rather
than practicing as a physician, but
she isn’t totally sure.

“The program is six years long,
instead of the four-year MD
program, and I haven’t had the
actual experience yet. Anything
can happen in six years.”

, continued from'10 am until 5 pm
‘ Saturday, standing the whole time,
waving his arms and pointing to
; bidders, and running his hand over
'”_7"the benches, trafﬁc lights, ﬁre-
 _ men's hats and police call boxes
‘9 that were auctioned this weekend
at the Great Garage Sale sponsored
- by the city of Pittsburgh.
The City offered some interest-
, ing items in an attempt to clean out
‘A its attic, but the most interesting
aspect of the sale was the
=: _- auctioneers, who chanted right
*  through the weekend. Allen ran the
sale on Saturday and Mat Luce,
with his daughter Betty Lou
Szonavek, an auctioneering team
from Somerset, too the reins on
Sunday. ,
'_Allen, who has been auctioning
, for 24 years, worked in a factory
 when he started attending auctions
* and became fascinated with the
rhythm and pace of the auction-
I eers. He likes to’ be called
“Colonel” George D. Allen.
“The---‘D’ makes it sound good.
Colonel is just something auction-
eers in the United States are called.
,_ It doesn’t mean a thing. It’s like
" . calling a judge ‘Your Honor."’
post-Civil War days when Army
Colonels were ordered to sell
_surplus property to the highest
_ bidder. Auctioneering schools
I ." ‘ continue to confer the title on their
 alumni.
* " When Allen is on stage, his
words pour out so fast it’s hard for
-‘anyone unfamiliar with auction-
‘ eeringvto understand what he is
‘I; :7 saying. Off stage, however, he
 gspeaks slowly, almost cautiously,
 when explaining the intricacies of
 his trade. His right hand, accus-
tomed to waving at bidders, keeps
‘pointing and gesturing as he talks.
~ “Anauctioneer has got to be an
. entertainer,” Allen said. “Auc-
1"-» tioneers, preachers and entertain-
ers. It’s the same type of
‘ thing--you’re up there in front of
the crowd.”

“When I walk out on that stage,
I’m a little nervous like any
performer, and I’m wondering if
they’ll bid. You just have to stand
there a while, not saying anything,
and let them look you over. You’ve
got to look comfortable and pretty

neat, even when it’s freezing out,” '

Allen explained. “You see, people
expect an auctioneer to come out
and start talking right away. Let
them look you over for a while and
they’ll be saying,
dude?’

“When I first heard someone
calling a sale,‘I thoughtyou had to
speak some kind of foreign
language to be an auctioneer,”
Allen said after Sunday’s sale.
“But I kept listening. .No two
auctioneers are the same and, if
I stay around one long enough, I
start to pick up his style. I kep
listening and practicing.”

Allen called auctioneering the
oldest profession in the world and,

country auctions like those of today

frequently, though there are no
records to substantiate their
occurrence.

Today there is no such thing as a

auctions start anywhere from the
man up the street selling his
children’s bicycles to a sale held
recently in Monaco of furniture and
decorations from the Baron and

netted $4 million.

According to Allen, everything
used in canned goods is auctioned

produce, tin for the cans and paper-
for the labels.

Recovery with
‘Texture’ LP

BY TOM WASELESKI

Extra Texture [Read All About It],
George -Harrison. Apple Records,
SW-3420.

I always have judged ex-Beatle
music in terms of Beatle music.
Though some may consider this
unfair, who would’ve paid much
attention to a new star chanting,
“My sweet Lord...” or “Give
peace a chance.”?

Anyway, George Harrison's new
album, Extra Texture [Read All
About It] is full of all those
“Beatle” songs his other albums
lack. For this record, he’s
resurrected the piano that led so
many of the good songs on his ﬁrst
solo effort, All Things Must Pass,
and he’s thrown in the horns
everybody’s using nowadays, so
that some of the cuts come out like
“Isn’t It a Pity” with a little of that
“Dark Horse” flavor.

“You’-’ starts the record off and
Leon Russell on keyboards carries
the whole tune. “A Bit More of

T\'~_‘

You” (which is a bit more of v~

“You”-- 45 seconds worth) leads
off the second side. .

‘ “The Answer’s at the End”
sounds like it came off Harrison’s.
ﬁrst record. , . It’s a good Beatle
song.  You can almost hear a
Lennon-McCartney backup on the
long refrain; what this really needs
is McCartney’s bass.

' “This Guitar (Can’t Keep from
Crying)” (which I is not to be
confused with the title or quality of
“While My" Guitar Gently Weeps”
from The Beatles (the white
album)) sounds like a post-Golden
Age attempt at repeating a rock
classic. Whereas Harrison's guitar
used to “weep,” it now merely
cries, and there's the difference.

a lot more than this someday,” he
prodded.

As the bidding continued on
various items, Allen interrupted his
rhythmic shouting with short
remarks to his audience, some-

.times addressing by their first,
names people he's seen at many of‘
his auctions. _

“There's a man standing under-
the shade of a tree on Cedar}

Avenue and he wanted to bid on‘
now, not Iive minutes Irom now.

The auctioneer’s main function is
to keep the bids coming in fast and
to keep them high.

/-~.,_‘-p.‘.You have to keep talking, you

:'L[‘:ll‘I leave big gaps. That's when
we use that’s called filler.
Sometimes Itrill the numbers, like
forrrrty," he said like a high—school
Spanish teacher.

/“There are one-word fillers, two
and three words. ‘Now’ is a bad
filler because everybody uses it.
lt’s okay to use it sometimes, but if
you keep saying ‘Go 45, now 50, 50
ﬁfty,‘ people will get bored with
your voice. You've got to keep
them interested. Another filler is
‘who'll give me,”' which Allen

runs together as one word.

“The auctioneer has got to be
somebody people want to know
,5?-‘ﬁxer when the sale is over. We're

 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  

get caught."

He added, “You can't tell how

 much money somebody has by
 looking at him. That bum over

there may have a lot of money

5 today or someday. When I'm done
3 with a sale, you couldn't get a
 dime more out of it.”

In addition to actually selling the
merchandise, the auctioneers must
know how to write up the sale, be
familiar with the quality of the
tems so they know what kind of
offers to accept and know how to

 

  advertise a sale.

Children and parents examine
the highest-priced “bargain” of
the afternoon—an antique fire

engine. Mannella photo

can't see their faces unless you-

bend down and look under, but you
have to do that to get the bid.”

Allen said there are things
auctioneers have to pick up that
aren't exactly honest, like raising
the bid and picking a starting bid
out of the air.

“You’ve got to be able to do it

  
 
  
 

Another important facet in a sale
5 its ending.

“You need to have a good strong
ﬁnish. You've got to thank the
people, make them think there was
nothing to it. Saturday I stood up
on that stage from 10 until 5
o'clock, my legs were hurting and I
didn’t even have time to get
anything to eat, but Ihave to let the
people think I feel just like I did
when I started the first bid.”

One problem that plagues many
auctioneers is losing their voices
after several hours of calling. Allen
recommends wrapping a cold towel
around the throat and going to bed.
He said the cold will shrink the
muscles in the throat and relax
them. Allen said he doesn’t have
trouble with his voice too often

know how to get out of it if you do -

long periods of time.

Allen and Szonavek agree
auctioneering is worth the effort
spent in practicing when ﬁrst
starting out.

‘‘I learn something new every-

time I do a sale,” Szonavek said. , ,g -1

Allen said, “I get to meet -all

and see a lot of merchandise. But,”
he cautioned, “You have to really

want to do it to be any good at it.”

refrain in “World of Stone,” the
voices could use a few trademark
“I-buried-Pauls” or “everybody’s-
got-one-everybody’s-got-one" to
liven things up a bit and perhaps
give us a few more clues to
whatshisname’s death.

A possible slur on Melissa

song on the album. It’s a nice

“Grey Cloudy Lies” is piano,

electronic synthesizer and Harrison ‘

guitar--another ‘‘All Things Must

the album in general, just as a
replacement for strings, and it
makes a nice effect. Sort of steers

the music away from religious"

preoccupation, for which Harrison
is often known.

Defense May Be Key

BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

The word for the day at the
weekly Pitt football luncheon was
defense. And to substantiate that
point were Defensive Line Coach

_ Jim Dyar and last Saturday’s

standout defensive stalwart Al
Romano.

, A football luncheon usually
‘consists of the standard repertoire
the same
the tiring
football jargon. —“One game
doesn’t make a season,” Dyar
started out, setting the pattern for

 the day.

But if one would take the time to

it sort through all the rubble, he
I might be able to garner a brief
‘ insight into the game of football,

the men who play it and possibly
the direction of the remainder of
the season.

One thing did shine through
yesterday. Along with the guarded

7 optimism came a"couple of

statements that sounded downright
positive.

“This is the best defensive front
we. have ever had at Pitt, since
Coach Majors has_ taken over,”
said Dyar, referring to his trio of
Romano, Don Parrish and Randy
Holloway. “Their improvement

‘ this season has been surprising,

maybe even remarkable. I would
,attribute their accomplishments to

  
  

improved technique, better person-
nel and to expert coaching,” said
Dyar, grinning.

Next to the podium was Head
Coach Johnny. Majors, and he
reiterated Dyar’s enthusiasm in his
finest Tennessee draw].

“The defense played an exquis-
ite game on Saturday,” Majors
stated. “We’ve decided to call our
defense the ‘Red Shirts’ for their
accomplishments. You‘ know,
red meaning ‘stop’?.”

Majors’ praise of his defense
turned from the group to individ-
uals. “Dennis Moorhead, well, he
is one" of the best. As far as I’m
concerned, he has no peers until I
see one.

“And there’s Arnie Weather-
ington,” Majors continued.
“Arnie has been playing as well as
I’ve ever seen him play. He graded
95% in the Duke game, and that’s
almost unheard of. .

‘‘Al Romano has improved 100%
since last year. He gets better all
the time,” Majors said. “Along
with Holloway and Parrish, they
gave up only 33 yards net rushing
to Duke, and that has to be maybe
one of the best efforts in Pitt
history.” -

Majors’ pride shone through. It
was a pride he has installed in his
defensive corps. “This defensive

unit has pride, and a lot to be proud
of.__ That’s why they’re the ‘Red
Shirts.’ They have the respect of

their opponents, and they’ve
earned it.”

The aspect of the team that has
Majors smiling the most is the
defensive depth. “On Saturday we
were able to alternate everyone on
our defensive team, playing every
position two deep without leaving
any glaring weaknesses.” This is
depth. This is also the trademark
of a contender, a winning football
team.

When the topic turned from the
brilliant defense to the offense,
Majors’ pride and enthusiasm
retreated to guarded optimism.

“I think we had a good game
offensively against Duke,” he said.
“We were just inches from
breaking that game wide open. I
feel the blocking and timing on our
veer is getting better every week
and should continue to improve.

“We didn’t have any fumbles,
any interceptions or any penalties
called on the_of_fensive team last
week. We made some mental
mistakes and missed a few blocking
assignments. We're learning more
all the time.”

As for the upcoming ﬁght with
Temple Saturday, Majors fell back
on a cliche. “They’ll beat us unless
we play the game we’re capable of
playing. They have a fine football
team that just hasn’t gotten the
right breaks yet this year.”

So much for cliches.

Inconsistency Problem

For Temple Football

BY JIM SPAN OS

Temple Coach Wayne Hardin
has discovered it may be human to
err, but that to schedule four of
your team’s biggest games in the
first ﬁve weeks of the season is
downright stupid. Conversely, Pitt
Coach Johnny Majors has encount-
ered considerably fewer problems
in this," his third year as the
Panther leader.

But first, let’s talk about
Hardin’s Owls. Last year, the Owls
posted an 8-2 record and at one
point were rated in the nation’s top

A 20. Good company. Though their

schedule wasn’t impressive[it in-
cluded such un-powers as Mar-
shall, Southern Illinois, Holy Cross
and Villanova] they did beat Boston
College and West Virginia rather
impressively, and people began‘
taking them seriously.

All that has changed this year.

After a heartbreaking 26-25 loss
to Penn State in the opening game
of the season, Temple’s fortunes

‘have deteriorated. The week after

State, the Owls journeyed to
where they were
Then Boston

not up to playing that type of
competition that early in the
season. We lost two first-team
defensive tackles before the season
started, then one thing led to

At Temple, Hardin must deal
with a great deal of adversity.
First, there’s tlfe problem of
getting people to watch the games.

enough people in the stands,"

Joe Stone,
No Glory

on Line

BY JIM LEWIS
What istogetherness?

It could be that special ingredi-
ent that changed an also-ran into a
contender.

It also could be that slight edgg
between good and great.

Whatever it is, the Pitt Panthers
have it, according. to Panther of-
fensive tackle Joe Stone.

“Lots of times the offense and
defense on a team are separate.
But 'at Pitt everyone is close
together,” Stone claimed.

“Everyone gets along."

Stone, a 6-4, 255-pound junior at
Pitt, plays on the offensive line, a
position that does not -inherit gobs
of public adorations.

“That’s one of the inborn things ‘

a linesman has,” Stone regretted.
“Of course, I don’t hear what’s
said on the radio. But if the
offensive line has a good game, -‘.,
do get credit from the coaches."

Such an unheralded job in the
public eye prompts a person to ask:

Why choose to play the offensive
line?

‘‘I didn't really have a choice,"
Stonesaid. “I played defensive
tackle in the spring of my freshman
year, but I didn’t care for it. I like
offense better.”

Stone definitely prefers offense
over defense; especially the veer
offense.

“The veer offense is a good
offense. With the personnel we
have, I don't see how we could run
any other offense," Stone com-
mented. _ '

“We haven’t unleashed
veery offense yet,” Stone correct-
ed. “We haven’t been running the
veer offense so far--we just set up
in the veer.”

“But when we do unleash the
veer offense, I can see future
games in which we’ll gain at least
400 yards rushing.” '

Somebody who could prove to
the rest of the nation Pitt is one of
the best, maybe?

“We’ll be ranked at the end of
the season,” Stone ‘promised.
“Heck, if we win games against
Penn State and West Virginia, who
are already nationally ranked, we’ll
have to be.”

And if Pitt does make it into the
elite Top Twenty this year, will it

be because of talent, strategy

depth?

The Panthers have all those
traits. but they also have another
important ingredient--together-
ness.

“Togetherness--that’s the main
thing,” Stone said firmly. ‘SWe’

. “Togethemess--that’s the main
thing,” Stone said firmly. “We’re
a lot closer than in years before.”

As a matter of fact, the
togetherness is so strong that one

player would not hesitate to give '

credit to his teammates. _
“The offensive line is even more
together than before,” Stone said.

“Tom Brzoza, Ed Kurcharik agiua...  -»,
John I-Ianhauser, have played very"‘ ‘

well this year on line. Last week
they all had a real great game.”
Now that’s togetherness.

Owls Face Adversity A

(Continued from Page 10)

Hardin noted.
evident two weeks ago when
Boston College came to town, and
only 10,000 die-hard fans were in
attendance. “Attendance at this
game will depend on how many
people from Pittsburgh come to see
the game," he mused.

You can give Hardin credit for
maintaining a sense of humor
through these difficult times. A 1-3
record isn’t going to impress
anybody, and really, Temple’s
season comes to an abrupt
conclusion with the Pitt game on
Saturday. The rest of the schedule
is Akron,.DeIaware, Dayton, Rhode
Island, Drake and Villanova. Yawn.

“Our program is coming,”
Hardin said, “though we’re not
‘there’ just yet. Our offense hasn't
scored enough points, for one
thing. Our quarterback, Pat Carey,

is coming along, though he's just _,

getting his feet wet. He has a good
game, then a bad one, then a fair
one." ._

“We won't change much,” he
continued. “We’ll still play it -11
people and hope they can do the
job."

Hardin is making it clear that it
isn’t all that easy to turn a football
program around. Temple’s perfor-
mance this season possibly could
set its program back two or three
years, and at_ minimum, it's not

‘ going to help it.

In a similar situation two years
ago, Majors tried his hand at
upgrading a pitiful program, and so
far there’s been a lot to cheer
about. But, like they say, the more
you win, the more you're expected
to win, and whereas three years
ago if the Panthers won 2-0 it was
good enough, that’s no longer true.

Things change. Expectations
increase. However, one thing that

' doesn't change is Majors’ wide--

eyed smile after a win.

‘‘I’m more optimistic about the
possibilities of our football team
right now,” he said “at this stage

of last year, we had scored 72

points. This year we’ve scored 90.
“Defensively, we’re holding our
opponents to 95 yards less per
game than last year. With
continued acceleration on offense,
we’re going to burst open in the
future,” Majors said, smiling.

Majors’ greatest problem is
maintaining a straight face when
one of the members of the press
asks him if he regrets -having gone
to the veer.

Yesterday the culprit was Sam
Nover from WIIC-TV. And Major's
gave the response given. many
times this year, a simple “No.”

When you look at‘ the Pitt

'«”statistics, you see that in this, the
" “year of the veer,” quarterback

Robert I-Iaygood has carried the
ball 70 times; Tony Dorsett, 64, and
Elliott Walker, 57. So, someone
asked, why isn’t,Dorsett carrying
the ball more? Is Haygood using
good judgment on the option? 1

“Haygood has used very good
judgment," Majors explained.
“VERY good judgment.”

After a few moments of silence,

Majors added sorn_e__fg_r_th_er__e1‘-:

That was quite-

l

planation.

“Veer, that damn term," he
said, his face doing a swell

imitation of a tomato and that big
grin popping through again. “We
should have called it the ‘Cloud of
Dust Offense.’ You know, when
people hear you say veer, they
expect 60 yards, 80 yards every
time.

“With split backs, you have a
little more balance. Frankly, I’d
like to give him [Dorsett] the ball

And more important...you'll get the feel of the Air
Force and an indication of what's to come.

Chart your course to the future....At the end is,a
rewarding, challenging job as an Air Force navigator.
And the checkpoints leading to that end are “proven
benefits" and “educational opportunities.”
