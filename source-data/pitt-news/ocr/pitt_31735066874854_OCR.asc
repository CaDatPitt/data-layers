Tony Herbert, Col. ’56, the

“Conquest to Nowhere.”

The 246-page book, about the

trenches along Heartbreak Ridge
and Pork Chop Hill, was written
in collaboration with Robert L.
Niemann. The book, released in
America last Saturday has already
been published in a Far East edi-
tion.

In one of the ﬁrst‘ reviews on
Herbert’s book, Leonard Mend-
lowitz, Sun-Telegraph e r i t i c,
says, “You can’t read it in a
hurry and you may not like
‘Conquest to Nowhere,’ but you
certainly won’t put it‘ down or

Gillespie, P. 57, Pi Kappa Alpha;
Eleanor Leslie, Ed. ’56, Kappa
Kappa Gamma; Elena Margaret
Mesiano, Col. ’57, Phi Mu, and
Maureen Palmer, Ed. ’56, Delta

In accordance with the theme
“The Great 48,” several groups
will present shows and booths
emphasizing a political, historical,
or cultural fact about their
choosen state.

To kick oﬁ the Week’s activities,
Friday, May 6, the North and
South will ﬁght again, this time
in a grand slam water battle on
the Pitt campus.

Two equal teams will be chosen
impartially from the applications
to be ﬁlled out at the Student
Desk. Both .Yankee and Confeder-
ate male students should sign up
immediately.

Several ﬁre—engine companies
have promised_ to lend ﬁre hoses
for the event, to take place during
the free ﬁfth hour in the parking
lot in back of Clapp Hall.

Main objective of the battle,-will
be for both teams to squirt the
ball into their oppositions goal
box.

Serge Daniels, Spring Festival
publicity chairman said, “The
spirit of Festival should begin
with the North-South battle. We
hope that the spirit of over-all
student body participation will
continue throughout the entire
week.”

During Festival Week, the
Women's Recreation Association
is sponsoring the Penn-ette Re-
lays, a female version of a track
meet.

The event will be held Monday,
May 9, at 3:30 pm. on the lawn
between the Cathedral and Heinz

tions are expected to compete for
three trophies."

Other events highlighting Spring

Mountain Drama

Stars Witch Boy

By IRV ROTHMAN

And slowly, slowly raise she up,
And slowly, slowly left him,

And sighing said, she could not

stay,
Since death of life had left him.
>1: =: 4:

The ballad or “Bonny Barbara
Allen” is the basis for Pitt Play-
ers’ ﬁnal show of the season,
“Dark of the Moon,” a colorful pro-
duction which demands special ef-
fort on the part of thespians and
yet may have proven too much for
them. i

The drama evokes the pathos of
“Brigadoon”, the choral power of
“The Grass Harp.” It is an at-
tempt to combine spiritual evils
with the rustic characteristics of
Kentucky folk. The change of
situation from such folk as Mrg.
Allen to the witches on top of Old
Baldy mountains requires a great
deal of imagination and a con-
scious realization that superna-
tural powers and superstition are
important folkways of rural life.

The transition between the
worlds of earth and witchcraft
is a diﬂicult one to make for
both actors and audience. The
show slows because of this qual-
ity. But the dialogue and humor
of the human folk reaps comedy
that lightens the portents of dis-
aster and speeds the action.

Ben Tatar, in the role of the
witchboy whose desire to be
human is short—lived, must bring
about this transition. His por-
trayal is a strong one of the hap-
less youth who yearns for the love
of Barbara Allen, his voice clear
and meaningful. But few times
during the show could this re-
viewer feel that he had come
down to earth literally.

Microfilm Issues
Filed in Library
Date to 1785

By NANCY o. JONES

Jay Jackson of “Twenty Ques-
tions” fame could easily surrender

his job to Miss Hilda Reitzel, Pitt’s ? ‘

reference room librarian. Eight
hours aday she is pummeled with
odd questions and requests such
as, “Who invented the zipper?”
and, “When was Pitt stadium
built, and what was the name of
the ﬁrst team that played the Pan-
thers in it?.”.

“Miss Reitzel’s job is to super-
vise the reference room which. she
calls the “information center of
the library.” During a normal day
she estimated 400 students are giv-
en information at the reference
desk. “But when investigative
themes are assigned there are at
least 500 people making inquiries.”

The native Pittsburgher, who
got her bachelor’s and master’s de-
gree from Pitt and her library
science degree at Tech, thinks the
reference library is crammed full
of “interesting” material. She said,
“The great thing in today’s library
world” is microtexts.

Source Material

Students who need more source
material, she explained, can ﬁnd
every issue of the New York Times
since 1851, and of the London
Times since 1785, and copies of the
New York Tribune from 1841-1900
all on microﬁlm in Pitt’s refer-
ence room.

A project which just began in

January, 1954, and which she

thinks will answer “the many

questions on local things” is

THE PITTSBURGH PR E S S

microﬁlm. Even the PITT NEWS

is kept on microﬁlm in the ref-
erence room. ‘

The reference library is’ equip-
ped, she asserted, with three dif-
ferent machines for reading micro-
texts: the microﬁlm, microcard,
and microprint reader. “In micro-
print about 100 pages can be put
on a six by nine card,” said Miss
Reitzel.

The ‘Kardineer’

To ﬁnd out what periodicals the
University receives and in what
Cathedral libraries they are, Miss
Reitzel uses the “kardineer,” an

MISS HILDA REITZEL——

chine, handy in locating peri-
odicals, since Pitt libraries are

al schools and departmental
libraries. Miss Reitzel is ref-
erence room librarian.

electrically-operated wheel behind
the reference desk. When a stu-
dent asks about a periodical, Miss
Reitzel pushes a button which
turns the wheel of cards called
“holdings” over until it comes to
the correct card.

Because the Pitt libraries are
“scattered about” in professional
schools and departmental librar-
ies, she must use the “ﬂexoline”
machine on the reference desk.
Miss Reitzel said the ﬂexoline
is very “handy” in locating peri-
odicals because it has a color
key—all cards with blue tops
signify Cathedral libraries, mag-
azines glisted on yellow-topped
cards can be found in the dental
school library, etc.

Some of the material in the ref-
erence room that many students
do not know about, she stated, are
the collection of information on
occupations and professions, an-
nual reports from companies, all
University publications, and col-
lege catalogues. Concerning the
latter, Miss Reitzel said, Pitt has
“the best collection in the city.”

Government Depository

Also, “Almost any government
issued publication can be found in
the reference room” because Pitt’s
library is a “government' deposi-
tory.” Miss Reitzel said that “the

government designates certain li-

Glee Club Sets Musical Tribute

Men’s Glee Club, directed by¢

David G. Weis, will present a
musical tribute to Chancellor
Fitzgerald tonight at 8:30 p.m.
The 65th annual concert will be
held in Carnegie Music Hall.

The program, including popular
tunes, novelties, and English glees,
-will consist of a group of 10th
century compositions. Schubert’s
“Contradiction” and “La Pastor-
ella” and Grieg’s “Land—Sight-
ing.” The latter will feature a bass
solo by Wilson Spencer, Col. ’57.

An inter-faith group of songs
will be composed of “A song of
Galilee”, “Once to Every Man and
Nation’_’, and “Hymn to the Vir-
gin” which will feature Dr. Rob-
ert Griswold as piano accompan-
ist. I

The 18th century compositions
will ‘feature “Sicut Locutus Est”
by Bach, and Hayden’s “Praise
We Sing to Thee,” which will be
accompanied by Sam McCune and
Burl Moone at twin pianos.

The solo parts in “No Man is

an Island” and “My Lord What A
Morning,” will be sung by Mike
Wiggins, Bus. Ad., ’58, and Joe
Sanford, 'Col., ’58, respectively.

Two quartets will intersperse
the music bythe Glee Club. The
first is the Varsity Quartet com-
posed of Donald Arbuckle, Rievan
Slavkin, Jack _,Dyssier, ‘and Emil
Herman. The Key Notes, a quartet
which includes four students from
Johnstown, includes Cleon Cornes,
Ed Paratore, Jim Vizzini, and
Vann Johnson.

’Tickets for the concert may be
obtained from members of the
Glee Club, and from the student
desk.

braries throughout the country to
be depositories,” thus all govern-
ment documents and publications
are sent here. However, “govern-
ment materials can be secured
only by asking at the reference
desk,” Miss Reitzel emphasized.

Clippings on local material,
such as the old Nixon or the
Salk tests, are saved. Miss
Reitzel scans the three local
newspaper and cuts out “nine-
tenths of the material on Pitt.”
Biographies and news items on
faculty members are ﬁled away.
Miss Reitzel has been working
in the reference room since 1945
with the exception of 1953, when
she had leave of absence. Her job
includes supervising the desk in
the catalogue room which is “the
key to the library” since “all books

have to be located through it.” She ’

heads a staff of six professional
librarians.

Although Miss Reitzel’s job is a
constant game of “Twenty Ques-
tions,”_ she thinks it is “most chal-
lenging work” and very “stimulat-
ing.” She likes being head refer-
ence librarian because she “learns
something new every day.”

to “pleasure herself. We’re not as-
sured that this portrayal should
have been virtuous. In hell we
might expect complacency, but on
earth a woman’s knowledge that
she gave birth to a witch should
certainly stir some doubt and
more grief within her motherly
bosom that Miss Elias expressed.
A moving performance otherwise.

The “boys (and girls) at the
stable” provide some of the more
riotous scenes with their risque
comments and local color as they
question John’s parentage. Jack
Ingram’s Uncle Smelique is a
wonderful example of the senile
“elder believer” who has seen so
many winters go by.

But the choral ' power and
vehemence of the revival scene in
church, lead by Preacher Haggler,
Ed Bachman, contributes an ex-
citing climax to Barbara A1len’s
fateful decision whether to re-
main faithful to the ‘witchboy.
Here is ﬁne change of pace.

Humor Supplanted

The humor of the confession
ceremonies are quickly supplanted
by the strength of forced con-
viction in the ﬁnal renunciation of
a lover. A large part of a large
cast combine to bring about the
best staging of the show.

Plaudits go to Bob Rosborough
(Marvin Hudgens), Nick Pranis
(Hank Gudger), Florence Mer-
melstein (Mrs. Allen), and‘Mrs.
Summey (Ruth Roth), for this
scene. Also to the two young
witches (Ravenna Palkivitz and
Karen Maegerlein) elsewhere.

Lighting effects, sound, and
scenery so very effectively de-
velop the illusion of there being
two different worlds of life that
they are worth seeing in them-
selves. Designer Lloyd Welden
Jr. and crew have come up with
another eye-catcher.

Although Players have met
their match in this show, “Dark
of the Moon” is still a happy ad-

dition to an overwhelmingly suc-
cessful season under director Har-
vey Pope’s tutelage, because it
has originality, uniqueness of
presentation, color, and music.

Tony Herbert
Publishes Novel

(Continued from Page 1)

It’s a brutal, factual book that
pulls no punches. There are no
heroes in this ungarnished tale of
bleak horror, for everybody is a
hero.

“His first book stamps Herbert
as a writer of great promise, and
his future works should prove
most interesting as his literary
talents develop.” ,

Mendlowitz concluded his re-
view by saying, “The jacket of
the book says: ‘It takes guts to
live with what you've read.’
That’s really an understatement.”

Herbert, of Herminie, Pa., has
among his awards the Silver Star,
Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Sig-
man Rhee Citation, Distinguished
Unit Citation and many_ foreign
medals.

During his 13 months of front
line duty in Korea, Herbert fought
with Company E, 38th Regiment
of the Second Division and with
the First Ranger Battalion.

More Titan Two letters

What’s in a degree? Is it just an indication of. amount
of learning or is it something more? These questions fre-
quently arise in the minds of graduating students as they
arrive at the realization that they are very near the end.

The word “degree” holds part of the answer by its
deﬁnition: “A point or grade marking relative quantity, a
step in a series.” Any degree granted by a college or uni-
versity is only an indication of a certain amount of train-
ing. Thestudents’ real education is yet to begin. But the
holding of a degree ‘will, expedite his further education to
a m_arked‘degree and, in so doing, will make‘ him more
valuable to prospective employers. T

In accepting a degree from this or any other university
you become an acknowledged studentbut you are still
classed as“a student. If, after receiving a degree, you de-
cide that your learning days are over, you must resign
yourself to a niche in life from which escape is impossible
for continued learning is vital to advancement in any ﬁeld.

. . An unknown author put it rather well as he conceived
a young man who, having recently. accepted a college degree,
rushed out and said; “Here I am World——I have my A.B.”
And the World replied, “Sit down Son and I’ll teach you
the rest of the alphabet.”

Justice for liberty-

So that last year’s undesirable repercussions in Spring

‘: Carnival Queen voting will not be‘ repeated, this year’s

Miss Liberty Committee has released a set of Contest Rules.
It is hoped that they will discourage all unfair practices
that have taken place in connection with the .Carnival
Queen Contest in previous years.

There is to be no campaigning of any kind; no posters
or pictures may be displayed on University property or in

~ the vicinity of Carnival grounds. The committee will place

contestants’ pictures in the voting tent on the carnival
grounds. Contestants may not be advertised over public
address systems, except if they appear in festival shows.
To assure the ,winner’s actually being the choice of all
concerned, it is essential that rules be strictly observed. If
a group breaks regulations, it will be responsible for the
disqualiﬁcation of their contestant. . T

By Irv Rothman

Coronation is expensive, unconstructive in an
American university, and superﬂuous. It has all
the earmarks of a ranking Hollywood extravaganza
except that it’s acted out by amateurs who don’t
believe in what they’re doing. «

They do get paid however—-in personal glory

A which far exceeds the modesty the average woman

at Pitt is supposed to possess.

~ The ceremonies are based on
a ritual which has a deﬁnite pur-
pose in England, but certainly it
can create no similar illusion at
the University of Pittsburgh. If
there are women who say that
coronation has its place here,
they are staring at the Gothic
walls of the Commons Room, and
not the granite exterior of the --
new engineering building or the rising beams of
a multi-million dollar medical center.

    

For Education?

We assume that students attend the University
to gain an education. They study the past in order
to establish for themselves what must be done in
the present in order to enhance a more sensible
world based on a, social and economic equality
for citizens. But what educational beneﬁts are

contract paralytic polio; that a ten-year era of
planning for expansion at Pitt will end with the
retirement of Dr. Rufus Fitzgerald; that one of the
greatest building programs ever developed at one ~'
time by any school is now in effect; that a “core”
curriculum is in advanced primary stages to give
students here a well—rounded education; that the v“
Engineering School will have a hand in making

' Pittsburgh a leading world center for the develop-

ment of peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Halloween Costumes
And the women still dress up in Halloween

‘costumes. They require their Queen to kneel be-

fore a Holy Bible to take an oath of allegiance

that she will rule wisely. They spend a great

deal of money on golden coronation programs and

ﬂowers to strew before the Q_ueen—-money that

could bring some women over from Europe to-
study in an American university. That would be

a queenly gesture.

It could all be so simple. The naming of Queen
on Tap Day lends dignity to _the position. Then

The Spring Festival Committee,
in hopes of making their week-
long University function complete
in every way, have graciously set
aside a booth for-—facu1ty mem-
bers.

Several’ -professors were ap-
proached by the committee with
the following proposals. If the
faculty will take the booth, it will
be rent free and all proﬁts shall be
used at the group’s discretion. All
planning and maintenance will be
left up to the faculty.

The main reason for this move,
by the Festival leaders, is to pro-
mote a closer student faculty rela-
tionship. It is needless to say that
in an urban university such as
Pitt, the majority of students know
their professors only as people
that lecture two or three times a
Week.

It is ti"ue that the faculty and
students get together outside of
the classroom. Although teas in
the Common’s Room and depart-
ment functions are held: they are

When faculty members were
confronted with these Festival
plans, the response was ‘somewhat
negative, although not entirely.
Many liked the idea, but‘ felt that
participation in this type of func-
tion would be undigniﬁed. " '

Yes, F e s t i v a 1 participation
would be undigniﬁed for Pitt pro-
fessors if they permitted the co-
ed student body to draw for dates
with them. This was done at Bay-

lor University not too long ago.

Faculty Spirit “

But, at the University of Wis-
consin, professors hold their own
at the school’s carnival. Old books

and relies are auctioned off at

nominal prices. Not only does the
faculty keep the students’ respect,
but they even gain more by work-
ing with the student-body more
informally than the classroom per-
mits. \ ‘C M
A faculty managed booth on the
Festival grounds is not meant to
be received in the same light as a

   

du cking ‘contraption. Students
don’t want to see their professors
come down to this level or any
other standard that would not
conote respect.

True School Spirit

Festival is one of the few op-
portunities when students at Pitt,
have a chance to show true school
spirit through working together as
a uniﬁed group. Inevery success-
ful student project the guidance
and approval of faculty members
are essential factors.

The theme of this year’s event is
entitled “The Great 48.” Although

-some states have been chosen as

themes, the majority remain open

and all entertainment will be on a

historical, political
theme. 

In lieu of the preceeding facts

we hope the faculty’s decision will
be in the afﬁrmative. _ i

Expected to meet with their greatest success in the Penn
Relays since the great Johnny Woodrufi and Frank Ohl
led the Panthers to four relay titles in 1939, Coach Carl
Olson will rely on quality rather than quantity in the 61st
annual relays at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, today and to-

IDOITOW .

Although there are eight relay events, the local track

mentor has decided to post en-O_

tries in only four,. even shunning
the shuttle hurdle relay that the
Jungle Cats won two years ago.
He feels that the concentration
of team strength on these four

' relays—mile, sprint medley, ds-

t a n c e medley,
and two-mile--
Will p 2 o d u c e

and k e e p the
runners f r o m
burning them-
se 1 v e s out by
p e r m i t t in g
them to receive
adequate rest.

Olson doesn’t
care to m a k e
any predictions
on how the locals will fare for the
simple reason that he does not
know in which events the’ other
schools will place -their strongest
contenders.

The Olsonmen expect to make
their best showings in the mile
and sprint medley relays in
which they were second and
ﬁrst respectively at Ohio last
week. Ed Saunders, Bil- Green,
Joe Dudas,,and Sowell are the
participants in the mile relay
while the arrangement for the
sprint medley will be the same
except Dave Peays "will replace
Saunders.

Green, » Saunders, Sowell, and
Wendell Harford will comprise the
challenging distance medley relay
with Alan Gunderson, Dave Freas,
Thorton Smith, and Harford run-
ning the gruelling four-mile relay.

Other events in which the Pan-
thers could conceivably be vic-
torious in are the two-mile run
and the pole vault. If senior Gun-
derson is in top form at the Philly
classic, he should easily make up
for his disappointing showing in
the Ohio Relays a week ago.

Jerry Louclksl asks:_;‘

What sort of ‘
work would I do
on my ﬁrst
assignment’
with Du Pont?

- GERALD I-OUCKS is currently working toward his M.S. in
Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology. Jerry
has served as president of his student chapter of A. I. Ch. E. and
participated in intramural sports——besides ﬁnding time to play
the trumpet in the R.O.T.C. and Kiltie bands. Right now, Jerry
is giving a lot of thought to the selection of an employer.

 

Charlie Lounsbury answers:

 

There is a great variety of ﬁrst assignments at Du Pont,
Jerry, depending on a man’s ﬁeld of training and the gen-
eral area of work he has selected. For example, I under-
stand you’re interested in plastics, and you might start in
development work on plastics, as I did. I worked with a team
of more experienced engineers to increase the capacity of
‘equipment used in producing “Lucite” acrylic molding
powder. This was a natural prelude to my next major
assignment, where I acted, as a liaison between Du Pont’s
Design Division and the plant group——on the design of a
new plant for making another form /of “Lucite” plastic.

Or take research work. Here a new man is generally
assigned to minor research problems until he becomes fa-'
miliar with _the general features and requirements of an
industrial research program.

A young man interested in sales may start in a plant or
laboratory dealing with the products he will later sell; or
he may join a group of trainees to learn selling techniques
right from the start.

» A man aiming for production supervision may ﬁrst spend a
year or so in laboratory or plant development work. Or he
may start as an operator—in a plant producing nylon or
“Dacron” polyester ﬁber, for example. In this way he ob-

~ tains ﬁrsthand knowledge of his process, and :stablishes a
bond of mutual respect with the men he’ll be working with
on his major assignments later. I
In general, Jerry, a man is‘ chosen for a speciﬁc job within
the scope of his major ﬁeld of study. His ﬁrst assignment is
intended to help him make the best use of his abilities as A

CHARLES W. LOUNSBURY, .lr., worked at
Du Pont’s Chambers Works for  summers
before he received his B.S. in Chemical Engi-
neering from Rensselaer Poly. Inst. in 1940.
Since then he has taken an M.S. from Carnegie
Tech., and has been continuously employed on
interesting assignments at various Du Pont
plants. Today Charlie Lounsbury is Technical
Superintendent of the Grasselli, N. J ., plant of
Du Pont’s Grasselli Chemicals Department.

Records Don ’t Cha

By«AGENE AROMATORIO ,

What does it take to be a world-beater? If
‘modesty is one requirement, then it’s little wonder
that Arnie Sowell is‘ a world champion at 19.

The lithe, 135-pound ‘track star has been setting
world and national running records for the past

year and in the process has brought more favorable
publicity to Pitt than anyiother athlete.

Sowe1l’s philosophy about this is, “You can’t
afford to get big-headed and rest on your laurels.”
Arnie adds, “When you get to the top everybody
I

“aims for you. It’s hard to get there and you have

to work twice as hard to stay there.”
Whitﬁeld Beaten Earlier
Listed among Sowe1l’s feats’ is a world’s record-_
tying performance in the 1000-yard run (in his

~ first effort), an IC4A meet record of 1:50.3 in the

880,'and another 880 championship in the NCAA’s.
On tap for the junior Bus Ad student are the
Penn Relays today and tomorrow at Philadelphia
and the Los Angeles Coliseum Relays May 20.
At the Coliseum Relays, Sowell will come up
against ,Mal Whitﬁeld for the second time this
yearin the 880. Earlier this year Arnie whipped
Whitﬁeld in the Pan-American Games at Mexico
City. Whitﬁeld long has been regarded as prob-
ably the best middle distance runner in the world.
Best Day in Ohio
, So far, Sowell has been concentrating on the
middle distance runs‘ but he did run the mile
recently——and won. Arnie reasons, “Pm doing pret-
ty well at the half-‘mile so I’ll probably stay with it
for a while but I deﬁnitely-plan to move up in
time; maybe in a couple years.” .

will bring to a close the college
riﬂe careers of Al Johnson, Bob
Zwahlen, Shepard, Cleary, and
John Benacquista.

Turnabout is fair play and the
Panther golfers turned the tables
on the West Virginia Mountain-
eer’s -Wednesday afternoon thus
setting the stage for their attempt
to go over the .500 mark in today’s
encounter against Westminster.

After losing to the Mounties 7-2
less than two weeks ago, the
linkers reversed the score by out-
shooting them 7-2 on the Shanno-
pin course. The Win gives the
locals a season mark of 2-2-1 and
a two—meet win string.

Team captain Bill Stockdale at-
tributed the turnabout to “the
home course advantage and im-
proved play of the lower seeded
men.”- Stockdale and sophomore
phenom Ken Fisher along with
Dick Ryabik, John Deﬁbaugh, and
Gene Farrell ' scored wins, with
Jim Zoccola being the only loser.

5.-4 WSVU Victory

No matter where they play or
when, whenever West Virginiaiwand
the Panthers meet in tennis the
result always apptars to be the
same, a 5-4 win for the Pittites.

This was the score on Wednes-
day when for the fourth straight
time the Panther netters defeated
the Mounties by only one match
margin. Once before this season,
and twice last year’ these two
squads played to the same ﬁnal
score. *

Although both the number one
and two men for the Pittites, Pat
Hughes and John DeCoux, lost
both their singles and doubles
matches, Herb Thompson, Art

Derbasse, Neil _ Zwieg, and Bob
Jacobs all came through with wins
to give the Panthers the victory.

PELAEZ

Weather permitting, the Panther mittmen should open
their home season against Washington and Jefferson this
afternoon at Mellon Field. Last Wednesday the sun was
shining brightly-—across the street from the Cathedral, the

ballers hung up a “postponed be-G

cause of rain” sign for the fourth
consecutive time on the Mellon
Park diamond.

One consolation is that W&J
will be the opposition instead of
the awesome Mountaineers from
West Virginia. Whereas the Moun-
ties are the hottest team in the
district the Prexies are near the
other extreme. '

.Pirates were hosting the Cubs—but the Blue and Gold base-

FROSII MITTMEN REPORT
All candidates for the fresh-
men baseball team should re
port to Walt Cnmmins Mon-
.day afternoon at the Field
House.

Last year’s Prexies bowed to

the Panthers by the score of_,14-4

while compiling a 1-11 season
record—and they appear to be
only slightly improved this season.

Youth seems to be stressed in
W&J’s starting lineup which is
composed of three freshmen, five
sophomores and a junior. Will
McAloon, a southpaw, will prob-
ably face the Panthers. If the lefty
doesn’t pitch, Stuart Lavow or
Bill Caldwell, both senior right-
handers, will handle the mound
duties.

Senior Don Miller or sophomore 5

Carl Lindstrom will probably pitch
for the Lewismen, who will be
shooting ofr their third straight
victory. 5

The rapidly improving Panthers

/.

jseem ready to live up to their
‘pre-season notices at last. Ap-
parently out of their early season
slump, they should be strong from
here on in. As coach Lewis re-
marked, “We could beat almost
anybody on a given day.“
Instrumental in the recent Pan-
ther victories have been the sen-
sational hitting of Bill Schmidt,
John Jacobs, and Ken Krapt. Foot-
ballers Schmidt and Jacobs are

while Krapf is hitting over the.
.400 mark. A '

Much cerdit for the recent up-
surge must also be given to the
improved defense of the Blue and
.Gold inﬁeld. Shortstop Dick Lep-
kowski and third baseman Jacobs
.have especially sparkled on de-
fense, as has catcher Milt Emery.

THE UN'IVERSITYl'_OF“PITTSBURGH

LiberalArts

Discussed

Something new and differ-
ent in course make-up will be
_discussed by a group of 25
-men and women who will par-
ticipate in an Experimental
"Program in Curriculum De-
velopment. Sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh and
the Center for the Study of
Liberal Education for Adults,
the program will start with a
Week-end conference ’May 14
and 15 at White Sulphur
Springs Hotel, Manns Choice,
Pa.

In this experiment, participants
will be asked to suggest ways and
means for developing a program
of liberal arts education for adults.
An effort will be made to deter-
mine not only the content of the
proposed courses, but also the
proper methods for most effective
presentation.

This invitation to lay people
to suggest courses “for the stu-
dents and by the students” is an
innovation in the educational
ﬁeld. It is hoped that the orig-
inal experiment, which will deal
with the ﬁeld of philosophy,
may eventually set a pattern that
will result in the development
of an over-all program of lib-

eral arts education for the adult
student.

Chairman of the conference will
be Dr. Putnam Jones, professor of
English, head of the English de-
partment, and chairman of the
University’s Core-Curriculum De-
velopment Program.

Since the initial experiment
will be conducted in the ﬁeld of,
philosophy, Professor Richard
Hope, professor of philosophy
and acting head of the depart-
ment, will serve as the expert
in that ﬁeld and as discussion
leader.

Other members of the Univer-
sity participating in this initial ex-
periment include Viers W. Adams,
Dr. Carroll Reynolds, Arthur
Young, Francis Pray, T. F. X.
Higgins, and George Fahey. Par-
ticipants from the Center for the
Study of Liberal Education for
Adults will be John Schwertman,
director-, and two of his associ-
ates, Peter Siegle and James Carey.

Drama Presented ‘

Sunday At YMHA

“The Eternal Mask,” a power-
ful psychological drama, will be
presented Sunday, May 1, at 8:15
p.m. by the Foreign Film Society
of the YM & WHA in the Morris
Kaufmann Memo-rial Auditorium

of the “Y” at 315 S. Belleﬁeld Ave.‘

This prize-winning Swiss ﬁlm
portrays the inside story of what
used to bereferred to as a nervous
breakdown, and steps away from
the usual screen formula of
romantic plot and counterplot. It
is the dramatic portrayal of a man
in search of himself, and delves
into the psychiatric implications
and mental aberrations of a dis-
ordered mind.

On Monday, May 2, at 8:15 p.m.,
the B e a l-Stolarevsky-B r o w n-
Goldby Quartet will present a
recital of chamber music at the
Isaac Seder Educational Center
at the “Y,” and on Tuesday, May
3, the Educational Center will
present a talk by Dr. John B.
Reinhart on the normal problems
of everyday parents.

Dr. Reinhart, psychiatrist and
staff member of the University’s
School of Medicine and Western
Psychiatric Institute, will discuss
“Bed Time is Lonely Time.”
