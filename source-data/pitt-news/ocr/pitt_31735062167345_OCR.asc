' Whites Retain False

‘Magnolia Image’

By VIRGINA JOYCE

“I’m sick of the ‘Magnolia Myth
Image’ that the Negro has,” fum-
ed James Farmer, director of the
Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE), from 1961-1966. Farm-
er spoke Tuesday on Blackness,
Power and America’s Future.

“The Magnolia Myth Image’ is
the picture of the contented Ne-
gro slave strumming his guitar
under a magnolia tree,” said Far-
mer. Terming the Negro subcul-
ture “the only indigenous Ameri-
can Culture,” Farmer blamed the
dominat White society for retain-
ing this false image of the Negro.

There is no wonder that “the
blackman seeks to be white,” he
said, “The American education-
al system, on all levels, pre-
school, elementary, high school
and even university - has present-
ed this black image in its text-
books . . . Hollywood is guilty of
portraying the Negro as a lov-
able pet, too.”

Farmer acknowledged that the
Negro has made gains since the
1954 Supreme Court Decisions.
He defined the decisions as “a re-
formation, not a revolution. It
caused those outside the machin-
ery to be included into the mach-
inery (of society).”

There has also been an “upward
mobility of those who are already
able,” according to the speaker.
“The black Ph.D. has a name;
Negro college graduates are
sought after by companies as
‘showcase Negroes’—somebody to
sit by the door.”

However , stated Farmer. the
less qualified Negro is in troub-
le. His job has been lost to a
machine. The gap between the
average white and the average
black incomes is widening. “And

Mail Tampering

segregation has increased, not de-
creased,” claimed the Civil Rights
leader.” especially in North-
western cities.”

“What we need now,” Farmer
went on, “is a psychological
change. The Negro has to come to
terms with blackness, to foster
self-love. . . and self accpetance.”

This is a factor behind the “re-.

discovering of Africa” that Farm-
er described. “I don’t agree with
the return to Africa wave popular
among some. But I consider Af-
rica an important source of roots
and ancestry for the Negro.”

As outlined by Farmer, “the
campaign to move the white con-
science has not worked because
it has understimated the force of

racism in this country.” “The-

answer, now,” he proposed, “lies
in a gain of economic and poli-
tical strength. Negroes can at
least command respect and equal-
ity if not love.”

More jobs alone will not solve
the problem of the income gap,
Farmer thought. “There is a
necessity for ownership. People
do not burn and loot what they
have an interest in.” He pointed
out that the success of the Watts
Manufacturing Company, own-
ed and operated by Negroes,
“should be repeated in all major
American cities.”

According to Farmer, after bol-

“I am not likely to see these
changes in my lifetime,” he mus-
ed, “and probably, my children
will not, either . . . The Negro
community has a great need for
ethnic cohesiveness — to become
a cultural entity in a plurlistic
society.”

“Humanity does transcend col-
or,” Farmer believed,” This was
Dr. King’s dream. But one can-
not love humanity if he first does
not love himself.”

Buy A Gun — “]ust Like The
One That Killed Kennedy”

By PEGGY ALLEN and
EARLE JACOBS

Like to‘buy a gun? “I have
one just like the one that killed
Kennedy-only $30.”

The speaker was a salesman in
the Security Loan Company on
the North Side. We had decided
to see firsthand how easy it is to

obtain firearms in Pittsburgh. We
found that it is disgustingly easy.
The first store we visited was
Levy's Loan Company, also on
the North Side. We told the pro-
prietor that we needed a pistol
for protection against burglars.
He said that although he didn’t
have pistols, he had a 12 guage

Summer Orientation
To Begin Sunday

By PEGGY ALLEN

There has been some change in
the Summer Orientation program
for the Freshman Class of 1972.
The main difference between this
year’s program and last year’s is
that there will be three sessions in-
stead of the usual eight.

The first session begins Sun-
day. The change was initiated by
a student Gov. Report.

Sessions last three days. Fresh,-
men are required to attend meet-
ings with the various Deans and
the Faculty Advisors. Each stu-
dent will also have a private ap-
pointment with his advisor. A ser-
ies of coffee hours are planned
each morning so that parents may
meet with University faculty and
administration.

The freshmen have plenty of
free time between testing and ad-
visor meetings so they may
browse through the campus. This
provides each one with an oppor-
tunity to become familiar with
the University.

Co-ed Sues Postal Official

Does the Federal Bureau of In-

vestigation (FBI) or the United
States Postal Service have the

right to tamper with the mail of a
United States citizen?
University Co - ed Mary Buf-

wack thinks they don’t have the
right.

  

 

Files suit against FBI and the
Post Office.

A Junior anthropology major.
Miss Bufwack filed suit against
Peter K. Kenny, superintendent
of the Oakland Post Office, and
Ian McClennen. head of the Pitts-
burgh Office of the FBI.

Miss Bufwack charges that from
the beginning of April to the date
of suit mail in her post office

box was torn open. She M995 *0,

     

collect $250,000 in damages.

American Civil Liberties Un-
ion attorney, Mrs. Majorie Mat-
son, praised Miss Bufwack for
“bringing into the open alleged
tampering of mail by postal and
FBI officials.”

-“Too often people submit to
this kind of thing quietly,” said
Mrs.Matson.

Miss Bufwack’s attorney poin-
ted out that another person had
filed a similar complaint of mail
tampering Sunday.

University Law School Profes-
sor Thomas Cooley agreed with
Mrs. Matson’s sentiment. He
maintained that the laws of mail
privacy have been violated a
number of times by the Post of-
fice and the FBI.

“But the FBI and the Post Of-
fice can’t do it legally,” said Mr.
Cooley. “They have not authori-
zation to read anyones mail for
any reason, not even for claims
of National security.

Pittsburgh FBI Head Ian Mc-
Clennen denied the allegation in
Miss Bufwack’s suit. “There is
absolutely and unequivocally no
truth to the allegations,” said
Mac Clennann.

Postal Supt. Kenny was simply
taken by surprise by Miss Buf-
wack’s filing of suit. He main-
tained that he did not know Miss
Bufwack personally and that he
did not know anthing about the

 

alleged tampering charges claim-
ed by the University co-ed.

A postal inspector, however,
said that he had received a com-
plaint from Miss Bufwack, ac-
cording to the Pittsburgh Press.

The Inspector went on to say
that Miss Bufwack refused to
hand over the open mail for in-
vestigation.

In a message to the freshmen,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar says,
“College is probably the single
most important experience you

-have undertaken so far in life.

That is why I am particularly hap-
py that you have an opportunity,
through the Undergraduate Orien-

tation Session, to become better ac-

quainted with the University.

Several social activities are also
planned in order that the fresh-
men may become acquainted with
each other. “A part of the educa-
tional process, of course,” says
Dr. Posvar, “is the social side of
college life - associations with
students from different geogra-
phic and cultural backgrounds
and the opportunity to enjoy the
activities and fellowship unique
to the college setting.”

A “fun night” at Trees Hall
and a Three Rivers Cruise are a-
mong the festivities.

The entire Class of 1972 will
also participate in a two-day fall
orientation. A day — long picnic,
the Freshman Outing, which is
“designed to bring the class to-
gether to develop a feeling of un-
ity” will be held on the first day.
On the second day, Chancellor
Posvar will welcome the freshmen
at a morning assembly and later
meet with them at a lawn recep-
tion.

The first week of school has
been designated as WELCOME
WEEK. Cultural, recreational, and
social activities are planned to
interest the incoming freshmen.

shotgun for only $24.50. “You can
sure get ’em with that,” he said.

Our next stop was Security
Loan. This shop sold pistols, but
the owner refused to sell us one
because he was uncertain of the
age requirements of the gun laws.
But he showed us some rifles: A
12 guage shotgun for $27.50 and a
repeating shotgun for -25.00.
When Peggy said that she didn’t
know how to aim a rifle, the man
said. “Just aim in the general dir-
ection. You'll get anybody within
twenty feet.”

Our last stop was Sears, Roe-
buck, and Co., Allegheny Cen-
ter. The Sears policy regarding
the sale of firearms is strict. Sears
has sold no pistols for the last
five years and will not sell rifles
and ammunition to minors. We
told the salesman that we were
over 21 and that we had a 19
year old friend who wanted to
buy a rifle. He told us. “You
can pick one up for him.” We
asked him what kind of gun we
should buy for burglar protect-
ion. He replied, “It just depends
whether you want to knock him
over or fix it so that he doesn’t
get up again.”

We found that it is easier to
buy a rifle than a handgun. Ac-
cording to Pennsylvania state
laws, anyone can walk into a store,
buy a rifle, and walk out again.
Only Sears has established its own
store policy requiring gun pur-
chasers to be 21 - years - old.
Requirements for buying a pis-
tol are more stringent.

The customer must be 21. The
police check to make sure that he
has no criminal record. This pro-
cess takes several days. Of course,
there is nothing to stop a criminal
from getting a gun. A friend with
a clear record can buy it for him.

People were not the least bit
surprised when asked about buy-
ing a gun. In fact, no one seemed
to care at all. We told one man
that sometimes we were frighten-
ed by noises at the front door.
He said that he could sell us a
shot gun that could shoot right
through the door. People unfami-
liar with firearms should not be
permitted to buy them.

Gary The Gun C
Is A Son—of—A

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

Eddie the Elevator was a per-
fect stranger to me, until I met
him on that day that was, what
you call, the end. I remember
him so distinctly, because he was
dressed in a black uniform, with
gold - black buttons, and silver
black braids. He didn’t say any-
thing to me at first, but just fres-
sed the button on the panel that
had the number one stamped on
it. The elevator sang a song, and

so did Eddie.

“Fabulous Flora, by gosh and
begora, you’ll know her strange
passion, when he opens the doora.”

The song didn’t have any parti-
cular tune, but Eddie sung it just
the same. The elevator kept going
down, and Eddie looked at me.

“Gary the Gun?” he asked.
“What?”

“I asked if you’re one of Gary

the Gun’s boys.”

“Yeh, I guess you could say so.”
“You like the rest?”

“I don’t know. What are the

“Well. how’s about if I tell you
your story, and then you tell
me if I’m right?”

“Go ahead. ” I nodded.

“Okay. Well, you were walking
along the" street with nothing to
do, or with something to do. and
you saw Gary standing in the win-
dow. Now since he’s so remark-
ably handsome. you stopped to
get a closer look. So Gary looks
at you and asks you if you have
a courage. Not wanting to seem
unfriendly, you reach into‘ your
back pocket, or front pocket. but
you discover that you’re all out
of courages. You tell Gary you’re
all out, but still not wantih- to
seem unfriendly, you go to the
nearest culture to see if they have
any of Gary’s brand. Well, they’-
re all out too, so you go back and
tell Gary that you can’t find his
brand in stock. But Gary comes
up with a brainstorm. Right?”

W “Yeh. You’re pretty accurate.”

“I know. Anyway, Gary says
he knows a place where they have

his brand, so you help him down
from the window. and you both
go off to get a pack of courages.
But the only thing is, that on your
way to the place that Gary told
you about, you run across a dere-
lect deer, an unloving wife, and a
loving unwife. all _of whom you
and Gary dispatch, by virtue of
your unerring accuracy and
Gary’s lightening - fast punch.
And then to top it off, when the
owner of the store
Gary’s brand tells you that he
doesn't stock it anymore. because
he felt the store needed a change,
you and Gary dispatch him also.
again with the utmost speed.
Then you spun, grabbed, fell, and
fryed, and wound up in this car.”

“Yeh. That’s what happened.”

But Eddie wasn’t paying any at-
tention to me, and was singing
that same lyric again, but louder.

“Fabulous Flora, by gosh and
begora, you’ll know her strange
passion, when he opens the dora.”

‘Honest Interview’

 

Dean Outlines Housing Plans

by RISE WEINBERG

The Dean of Women‘s Office
has long been considered by most
students to be one of the most rea-
ctionary departments on campus.
As I walked in to see Miss Sa-
vina  Skewis. whose new title is
Associate Dean of Students. I
took with me a typically negative
attitude towards the Administra-
tion. I expected Miss Skewis to
give me standard answers design-
ed to make the University look
noble. Worst of all. I fully anti-
cipated being handed a bunch of
idealistic garbage.

Instead I was met by honesty
and an earnest desire to under-
stand and help students. Maybe 1
related to Miss Skewis because
she reminded me of my swinging
Grandmother. But I’d like to think
that the interview was simply a
pleasant discussion between two
honest people.

Though the Women’s Housing
Restrictions seem antiquated to
women who have spent their lives
in the liberal surroundings of a
big city. Miss Skewis believes the
restrictions are very necessary for
freshmen women from small
towns have difficulty in adjust-
ing to the demands of a large
metropolitan university. If they
had unlimited weekend privileges,
they would go home literally
every week. Some would be home-
sick enough to go home: others
would go home to appease par-
ents who miss them.

While the University shouldn’t
have to be girl’s parent away from
home, many parents and students
demand that the school accept
the role of parent. Miss Skewis
gets many phone calls from par-
ents who are anxious about the
welfare of their daughter. Some
parents would like to see more
conservative curfew restrictions.

Since the University has been
providing dorm space for women,

‘its housing regulations have got-

ten increasing more liberal. All

changes have been implemented
by women students. However. a
good portion of the liberalization
has been suggested by the Dean
of Women's Staff. Miss Skewis
looks forward to the day when
all curfews will be lifted. She be-
lives that as the double standards
continues to move towards a sing-
le moral code. changes will be in-
evitable. When the women stu-
dents as a whole believe that
they are ready for total freedom.
then they will receive it.

When asked about any possible
changes in the near future. Miss
Skewis said that discussions will
take place in the winter concern-
ing lifting all curfews from senior
women.

Miss Skewis is in favor of
more off - campus housing for
women except for freshmen. She
feels that the freshman woman
needs the security of the dorm,
at least for that one year. Most
older women express the-desire
to live off - campus when they
are emotionally ready to be on
their own. Miss Skewis respects
the individual’s maturity in this
decision. It is unfortunate that
more really nice apartments are
not available for these women.

The recent incident of a Bar-
nard student living with her boy-
friend did not startle Miss
Skewis. She admitted that she is
certain similar activity is going on

make any attempt to dismiss a
University student accused of co-
hbitation. She would give advice
to any student who sought her
wisdom. but would not seek; out
the student herself.

The only time Miss Skewis
would undertake punitive action
on her own would be if the inci-
dent would harm the involved stu-
dent. Miss Skewis‘ major concern
is for the protection of students
in every possible way. The only
dismissals during Miss Skewis‘
period on the University’s staff

have been cases where the
student “presented a threat to
the other students in the dorm."

l— The Venerable Quang Minh.

superior monk at the Bao
Quoc Pagoda in Hue. had just
said he was not interested in
politics. but it was obvious
that some of the Buddhist stu-
dents in Hue were.

Bao Quoc. where Tri Quang.
spiritual leader of Vietnam’s mil-
itant Buddhists had become a

mon, was a shambles. Aw we
crouched our way through the
place of worship. I noticed the
slogans the students had written
on the walls.

“We thank our American
friends,” one commented ironical-
ly. “Life is a vale of tears,” said
another, quoting the Buddha. The
majority of the many slogans on
the Pagoda’s walls were in Viet-
namese, with a smattering of
French. But these were in Eng-
lish.

Bao Quoc had been shelled
when the NLF had assembled
nearby. Though the soldiers were
not inside the pagoda; the build-
ing itself was hit.

“Why don't you get the stu-
dents to clean it up?” I asked
Quang Minh, who looked surpri-
singly, young to be a superior
monk.’

“We will leave it as it is to re-
mind ourselves,” he said.

For the Buddhists life since Di-
em has indeed’ been a vale of
tears. Both American and South
Vietnamese government authori-
ties believe the Buddhists have
an annoying tendency to make
their peace with the world. So
Buddhism in Vietnam has had no
peace in a long while.

Relations between the Hue Bud-
dhists and the now—removed pro-
vince chief, Pha u-Van-Khoa, had
been strained, but it wasn’t the
Buddhists fault, Quang Minh ex-
plained.

Among other insults suffered
by the Buddhists, the provincial
government had refused to give
the pagoda its ration of rice, pre-
fering to instead distribute it on
a daily basis. “They don’t trust
us.” said Thich Quang Minh.

An additional problem has

been the Saigon government's
claim that Thich Don Hau, the
prominant head of the Hue Bud-
dhist association, had gone wil-
lingly with the NLF. Quang Minh
explained that Venerable Don Hau
was being held hostage because he
had refused to fly an NLF flag
over his pagoda, This contradicts
Saigon’s claim that the Buddhists
are in league with the Commun-
ists.

During the Tet battle, Quang
Minh said, the people had experi-
enced difficulty in purchasing
rice from the government be-
causd the government was afraid
the rice would fall into enemy
hands. But he doubted the stories
I had heard of starvation were
true.

After the offensive, the people

were more afraip of the NLF, the _

bonze said. And because the peo-
ple did not rise up against the
government, the offensive was, in
one respect, a failure. There had
been no rush to join the revolu-
tionary committees which were
intended to broaden the political
base of the NLF in preparation
for a coalition government.

“Most of the students here did
not join the NLF,” Thich Quanh
Minh said, (This was repeated
by the chairman of the Faculty
of Science at the University of
Hue.)

Hue University was not heavi-
ly damaged after Tet, but its
buildings were dirty, littered and
unkempt from a total lack of
maintenance.

I walked through the empty
buildings looking for some stu-
dents, but found only soldiers
quartered in the unused class-

ready crowded athletic field.

Americans for Objecting to the
Formation of a Vietnam National
Assembly.”

In the Faculty of Science build-
ing I was introduced to Nguyen
Van Hai, chairman of both the
Faculty of Science and the Facul-
ty of Pedagogy.

He told me the university had
been set back severely—there had
been talk of moving it to Saigon
for security reasons, but then
many of the students could not fol-
low the move. He expected the
University to reopen on May 1st
when the students will have con-
cluded their manditory military
training.

But the university will reopen
under almost impossible condi-
tions, having no books and no li-
brary equipment. Only 100 of the
10,000 books in the Faculty of
Science library were not burned
for heat. The lavoratories were
totally demolished and all of the
school records were destroyed.
The Faculty of Pegagogy library
was 80 per cent destroyed. These
damage estimates, Hai said, were
typical of the other faculties in
the university.

With similar damage at Can

Tho, South Vietnam’s universi-
ties can be said to be 50 per cent
destroyed.

Faculty of Science building to
house 70 American AID workers,
Hai said. And there was no cer-
tainty that the Vietnamese mili-
tary personnel billeted in the uni-
versity building ‘ would leave
in time for the openings.

The last time I was in Hue, I
was told that many university stu-
dents and some faculty had co-
operated with the NLF. Hai said
that only one faculty member, Le
Van Hao, chairman of the Facul-
ty of Letters and university libra-
rian, had joined the NLF. Hao,
who had just returned from
France, was not a communist, Dr.
Hai said. He is now making pro-
paganda broadcasts over Libera-
tion Radio and was said to have
been instrumental in obtaining the
release of two American Quakers
captured during the battle.

Though the students were near-
ly all against the war, few want-
ed to join the NLF, Chairman
Hai said. Perhaps a dozen of the
2,500 students at Hue had joined
the Front. One student, Le Dar,
suspected of being an American
agent because he had relatives
who worked for the American
government, was buried alive, he
said.

Of Tears’

Dr. Hai said that although the
North Vietnamese were well-dis-
ciplined — they did not eat for
two days, although they could
easily have taken food from the
people —— the local NLF guerillas
were poorly disciplined.

The educator said he believed
the brutality of the NLF cadres
-—the main reason why he and
other Vietnamese oppose the
Front — was the result of this
lack of discipline rather than of
an established policy of unfocus-
ed terrorism against civiliams.

He said he also opposed the
NLF because of the Communists’
actions in North Vietnam where
purges eliminated many members
of the right wing, nationalist party.

Gun Control

Ever since the Kennedy assassination a controversy has
been raging over gun control legislation. The President of
the United States has urged the Congress to pass more strin-
gent gun control measures. However, the Congress is some-
what reluctant.

In Harrisburg some state leaders are urging the pass-
age of gun control measures. This legislation, however, is now
bottled-up-in the State Legislature.

, The raison d’etre for these stagnant legislative condi-
tions is the constant pressure of the powerful National Rifle
Association (NRA). The NRA maintains that the constitu-
tional right to bear arms is sacred to the American way of

life.

What the NRA fails to realize is that concealed weapons
and rifles can easily fall into the hands of the mentally de-
ranged, the ex-convict, or even the paroled murderer. Is this
sort of possession sacred to the American way of life‘?

In Pittsburgh just about anyone whether he is over 21
or not can buy a gun. In order to give credence to this
thesis, two Pitt News reporters went downtown to buy guns.
They discovered, to their dismay, that they could have bought
a 12 guage’ shot gun, a 16 guage shot gun, or a whole arsenal
of pistols.

The most distrubing aspect of their journey, however,
was to discover the “come what may” attitudes of the gun
salesmen. One salesman showed them a .22 calibre pistol,
“just like the one that killed Kennedy.” When buying rifles
they were told by another salesman that they should buy
the 12 guage shotgun “if you want to fix it so they will never
get up.”

In short, most of the salesmen didn’t really care about
the implications of their salesmanship. We find this attitude
deplorable.

We join all responsible Americans in demanding that
stronger gun control legislation be passed. American society
has suffered enough from its shotgun spirit.

l\/[ail Tampering

_ The rights of privacy linger at the grassroots of the law
"in the _United States. Yet, in this age of “red bating” super
patriotism and the new left these rights may have been
abridged by the Government in the name of national security.

Miss Mary Bufwack, a junior Anthropology major,
charged Tuesday that her privacy was violated by the Post
Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) be-
cause officials tampered with her mail. Miss Bufwack claims
that Oakland Post Office Supt. Peter Kenny and Pittsburgh‘
FBI Head Ian MacClennan opened her mail. The junior An-
thropology is suing these Federal officials for $250,000 in
damages.

The suit filed by Attorney Ernest G. Nassar, Jr. main-
tained that the. Federal officials cited exposed Miss Buf-
wack to “shame and ridicule” by tampering with mail add-
ressed to her at her Oakland postal box. The statement of
suit contended that these acts were hurting her chances for
employment and “her progress toward university post grad-
uate work”.

. _Miss Bufwack was lauded by ACLU Attorney Mrs.Mar-
]0I‘le Matson. She maintained that many persons who have
suffered from this sort of abuse have simply not stood up
for their rights as citizens.

University Law Professor Thomas Cooley said that the
laws of mail privacy and tampering have been violated many
times. Mr. Cooley said that “the FBI and the Post Office
cant do it legally. They have no authorization to read any-
one’s.mail for any reason, not even for claims of national
security needs.”

We must agree with the sentiment and reasoning of Pro-
fessor Cooley. The alleged tampering of Miss Bufwack’s
{nail is indeed a serious charge that carries grave implica-
ions.

_If the charges of Miss Bufwack are valid, we are solidly
behind her in the fight against mail tampering, the Post Of-
fice and the FBI.

 

 

What The Pitt News Tries To -5

Good news reporting does more than give the facts. Good ‘news
reporting researches, analyzes, digests, and then presents to the read-
er a thorough pertinent coverage of all happenings.

The Pitt News attempts to do this, according to ten established
ground rules. They are:

(1) Nothing and no one is immune from“ ‘criticism.
(2) Everyone involved in a controversy has an intellectual res-
ponsibility to inform himself of the available facts.

(3) Criticism should be directed first to policies, and against
persons only when they are responsible for policies, and against
their motives or purposes only when there is some independent evi-
denceof their character.

(4) Because certain words are legally permissible, they are not
therefore morally permissible.

(5) Before impugning an opponent’s motives, even when they
legitimately may be impugned, answer his arguments.

(6) Do not treat an opponent of a policy as  he were therefore
a personal enemy, or an enemy of the country, or a concealed enemy
of democracy.

(7) Since a good cause may be defended by bad arguments,
after answering the bad arguments for another’s position, present
positive evidence of your own.

(8) Do not hesitate to admit lack of knowledge or to suspend
judgment if evidence is not decisive either way.

(9) Because something is logically impossible, it is not there-
fore probable. It is not possible’ is a preface to an irrelevant state-

ment about human affairs. The question is always one of the balance
of probabilities.

(10) The cardinal sin, when we are looking for truth of fact or

wisdom of policy, is refusal to discuss, or action which blocks dis-
cussion.

How Our Readers See It. . .

IS Violence The  Means ? there are always many things that

   

need change. but that is not my
Editor The Pm News point here now. What I am saying
In very recent times we have

seen riot after riot. one act of
violence committed after another.
And it is very often found with
college students that they will re-
sort to these exact measures in
order to so called “get anything
done.”

We are constantly reminded
that the administrations and bur-
eaucratized institutions of today
are at fault.

Instead of peacefully going
through the correct channels to

initiate change or development
(which used‘ to at least be one
of the basic codes of the Ameri-
can people), they force their ideas
right into the laps of “those in
charge” and their attitude is -
“you better do this or else we’ll
do such and such.”

We hear so much of what ad-‘

ministrations do wrong nowadays.
doesn’t anyone just wonder what
they might possibly be doing
right?

I myself would like to praise
the administration at Pitt! Sure.

is that through my personal exper-
ience I found that when I had a
legitimate gripe. and went
through peaceful channels in a
direct and intelligent manner. I
got excellent results.

I think many college kids tend
to forget that the people in the
administration are very human.
and if approached in a humanly
fashion they will respond to you
in the same manner.

Why won’t people reach out to
one another more and learn accep-
tance instead of the absolutely un-
stable violent approaches more
and more people are tending to
employ in getting their ideas to
be heard?

Be it the family. the school ad-
ministration. the national govern-
ment or what have you - they are
all built on people, people . . . .
really human people!! There is
absolutely always a better alter-
native than needless violence . . .

EDITORIAL COMMENT
FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY

During the first summer orien-
tation programs, the incoming
freshmen were bombarded with
the best image the University has
to offer . . . .a dance, a romantic
sail around the Golden Triangle,
and a swim-and-dance party (and)
the food in the cafeteria miracu-
lously took a turn for the better.

What no one seems to realize
is that the students who are here
this summer on a paying basis
also enjoyed the festivities, yet
they will see no more of this type
of entertainment until the next
orientation.

 

   

By BRUCE LEVENSON

Our draft system must be
revamped

This is the opinion of law-
yers Holzer, and Sen. Mark"
Hatfield (D.-Ore.) These peo-
ple filed separate reports criti-

cizing the conscription laws. The
Holzers’ call the laws unconstitu-
tional and contradictory to the
idea of _government by the peo-
ple. Hatfield feels that the pre-
sent system is outmoded and im-
practical, asserting that a volun-
teer army is more feasible.

“The power of Congress to clas-
sify and conscript manpower for
military service is beyond quds-
tion,” stated Chief Justice Earl
Warren May 27, when the Su-
preme Court upheld the prosecu-
tion of draft card burners.

The Holzers’ report, Written in
the October and November issues
of philosopher Ayn Rand’s The
Objectivist, questions the unques-
tionable. Government, they assert,
does not have the right to initiate
force agaihst any of its citizens.
The government, therefore, can-
not tell a young man what to do
with two years of his life.

“When the constitution was
drawn up, the power of Congress
to conscrift was neither denied
nor granted,” stated the Holzers.
“Congress was expressly given
the power ‘To declare War . . .
To raise and support Armies . . .
To provide and maintain a Navy,

Constitutionality not Tested

But the issue of Constitutional-
ity was not tested until Woodrow
Wilson signed the first conscrip-
tion law May 18, 1917, to provide

‘:ﬁ3ii'p'6W§f f6? the fll‘§’t Woflﬂ

War. Ten men, indicted for fail-
ing to register for the draft, in
challenging its constitutionality
before the Supreme Court, raised
every constitutional objection -
except what the Holzers’ call
“the fundamental one.”’

One major argument was that
Congress lacked the power to es-
tablish a law that forces men to
fight. The highest court felt that
the right was guaranteed in Ar-
ticle 1, Section 8; “As the mind
cannot conceive an army with-
out men to compose it, on the face
of the Constitution the objection
that it does not give power to
provide for such men would seem
to frivolous for further notice.”
The court discounted the alterna-
tive of an army made up of vol-
unteer enlistments.

“This,” said the Court, “. .

challenges the existence of all
power, for a governmental power

which has no sanction to it and
which therefore can only be ex-
ercised provided the citizens con-
sents to its exertion is in no sub-
stantial sense a power.”

The Court, according to the
lawyers, was really saying that
if it cannot use force, it has no
power at all. Article 1, section 8
also gives Congress the power to
provide post offices and post
roads. Men to fill the post office
functions were hired to work for a
monetary incentive. “It apparent-
ly never occurred to the Supreme
Court that any army could be
raided by this same method,
wrote the Holzers.

The separation of church and

state amendment of the Constitu-
tion formed the basis of another
argument. The religious exemp-
tion clause of the Selective Ser-
vice Act was attacked as being in
conflict with this amendment.
“Once again,” said the Holzers’,
“the Court skirted the issue:‘we
pass without anything but state-
ment . . . because we think its
unsoundness is too apparent to re-
quire us to do more.”’

13th Applied Again

The Thirteenth Amendment,
which barred slavery and invol-
untary servitude, was employed
for still another challenge. This
contention is “refuted by its mere
statement.” evaded the Court once
again. This conflicted with a 1911
Court decision (Bailey vs. Ala-
bama): “The Thirteenth Amend-
ment . . . was a charter of uni-
versal freedom for all persons, 
The plain intention was to abol-
ish slavery of whatever name and
form . . . to render impossible
any, state of bondage.” But, the
Court held that induction was not
involuntary servitude if some im-
portant duty to the state was in-
volved. “What duty” and “to
whom?” asked the Holzers’.

The Courts political philo-
sophy, they said, showed that
“freedom and the draft were mu-
tually exclusive.” “This endorse-
ment of statism as an element of
American constitutional law . . .
was the work of nine men who
were unwilling to meet, and un-
able to discredit, valifdi legal ar-
guments.”

To strengthen their argument,
the Court cited that 33 nations,

‘raft Rapped FromTwo Viewpoints

as of 1918, had used a conscrip-
tion system to people their armies.
Could our Supreme Court really
have believed that American citi-
zens were no more immune from
governmental force than were the
helpless peasants under the heel
of the Russian Tsar, or the miser-
able serfs under the whip of Jap-
anesd fudal barons?” asked the
lawyers Holzer.

The “fundamental” that was
not used is the most important
according to the attorneys. This
is the Ninth Amendment which
“represents the most effective con-
stitutional defense against con-
scription.”

The Ninth Amend uent states
that “The enumeration in the
Constitution of certain rights
shall not be construed to deny or
disparage others retained by the
people.” second, be fair in its ap-
plication so that every young man
receives equal treatment and no
young man is required to make
sacrifices that are not demanded
of his peers; and third, the sys-
tem must provide for maxium na-
tional security and must econom-
ically provide the armed services
with the needed quantity and
quality of men.”

Doesn’t Meet Criteria

“The current draft system,”
Hatfiled states, “does not ade-
quately meet this criteria. Any-
time a man is forced, against his
wishds, into military serivce his
individual liberty and freedom of
choice have been denied.”

The inequities of the draft have
been much discusses and well
documented.” sited the Senator
in refuting his second require-
ment. He pointed out inequities
of college deferments that discri-
minate in favor of the wealthier
and brighter young men who can
stay in school until they graduate.
Further criticism was directed at
the 4,084 draft boards that “have
been granted great latitude in in-
terperting and administering
draft regulations and this lack of
clear and nationally uniform
standards has led to situations

- where cases with similar circum-

stances have been handled entire-
ly differently in various parts of
the country.”

Amendment Guaranteed
Rights

This little used amendment was
originally intended to guarantee
to our citizens all of the rights that
were not mentioned specifically
in the rest of the Bill of Rights
or the Constitution.

“Our precious rights which this
law sought to protect and pre-
serve were slipping away,” write
the Holzers’ “. . . rights were be-
ing transformed into privileges.”

People acted only by permis-
sion of the government, in ig-
noring this important amendment.
and could count only on the en-
umerated rights of the Bill
of Rights and Constitution.

In defense of the present draft

system. General Lewis P. Her--

shey, director of Selective Service,
feels that the draft‘is the only
possible method of meeting mili-
tary manpower needs.

“A voluntary military recruit-
ment program is not only econom-
ically feasible and capable cg pro-
ducing the necessary number of
recruits,” contradicted Sen. Hat-
field in introducing the Armed
Forces Improvdments Act on
March 14,1967, “it can also pro-
duce the quality of military per-
sonnel that is vital to the soph-
isticated and technical nature of
the armed services.”

In this report, the Junior Sena-
tor from Oregon tried to present
the system of military manpower
recruitment that best meets to-
day’s realities and needs. He bas-
ed his opinions on the following
criteria: “First, preserve the max-
imum amount of individual liber-
ty and freedom from unjustified
instrusion by the government:

. is the fact that a smaller
and smaller minority of our young
men is carrying the burden of na-
tional defense. ”

“This manpower surplus has
spawned the many inéquitiesfof
the current draft system by elim-
inatih- the feasibility of requir-
ing all young men to share the
burden of insuring national secur-
ity. We cannot tolerate the in-
justice of a system that capric-
iously requisitions two years out
of the lives of some young men
while allowing others their liber-
ty.” Hatfield concluded.

The present draft laws fails the
third criterion, too, that of pro-
viding the necessary quantity
and quality of men needed for
maximum efficiency. The cur-
rent system, Sen. Hatfield con-
cedes, does havd the right num-
ber of servicemen, but that they
are extremely lacking in quality.
This is due to the high turnover
rate of the draftees - those who
have been taken. from civilian
life against their wishes — which
is 95 per cent. The cost of train-
ing a foot soldier is $6,000. This
money for training is expended
every two years when new sol-
diers replace those who have ful-
filled their obligations. Therefore
the draft provides the needed
quantity only at a great expense. "

paced the hitting attack for the
winners with three hits apice.
Watson, Lutz Kurzweg and Scott
Grant each drove in a pair of

In addition to the excellent
pitching and hitting, the Fana-

pleted two double plays to wipe
out potential threats by the
Mothers.

En route to the championship,
the Fanatics also defeated MBA

B 

Not Consistent

by ED CONLEY

Rex Peery would have liked
a few more wins for his golf
team this year, but the right
things did not happen.

The squad wvund up with a
6 win, 9 loss record, despite
Peery’s constant reminders that
he had a good team, one capable
of winning.

They did not win consistently
and Peery could not fihp out why.
Now he looks towards better re-
sults next spring and can only
explain this year’s losses with
statements like, “The holes
weren’t big enough. and “what
do you do when you’re in the
trees?"

One thing for sure, the sche-
dule did not help. It did not look
like it would be much more dif-
ficult than that of the year be-
fore. But, some of the returning
teams improved greatly over a
year’s time and many of the de-
feats were by large margins.

There were some good times
for the golfers, though. Bill
Bryan found these times more
often than anyone else as he con-
sistently shot in the middle and
low 70’s. He was voted the team’s
most outstanding player by his
teammates after the final match.

Golfers Wind Up at 6-9

The first win of the spring came
when ‘there was still hope for a
winning season. That win was
over Carnegie—Mellon.

Then, came a revenge win over
West Virginia, the team that
dealt the golfers their first loss.
This home opener led to the only
mark of success shown by the
duffers - a home record of 3-1.

The happiest moment for
Peery came when the golfers
won a double victory over Ohio
University and Indiana State on
May 7. Both wins at the Shanno-
pin course came as a result of a
sudden death playoff, by scores
of 4-3.

After that there was little joy.
Poor showings in the Easterns
and the Indiana Invitational
Tournament followed. Them came
the final two losses of the season
to Navy and Penn State by iden-
tical scores of 6-1. These losses
closed the door on hopes of a
successful spring.

    

 Richey Makes 1500 Finals;

By ROY JACOBS
Jerry Richey is one step closer to his Olympic dream.‘Yes-
terday he’ and 11 other runners qualified for the finals tomor-

row of the NCAA championship
qualify for the Olympic Trials to be held in two

finishes
weeks.

Actually. Richey ran the slow-
est time of all the qualifiers. a-
bout a 3:49. He finished third in
his heat behind Bill Wells of Mis-
souri and Tom Morrow of Oregon.
The 1500 meter time is “about 17
seconds off the mile time." accor-
ding to Richey.

Pitt’s other entry in the three-
day championships, Bryant Sal-
ter, failed to qualify in the high
jump despite clearing 6-8.

“I’m in pretty good shape to
finish in the top six,” commen-
ten Richey when reached at his
motel in Berkely, California. It’
ll be tough to crack the top three,
though.”

the 10.000 meter run. At the last
minute he changed his mind. In
the IC4A’s Richey resopnded with
a sub-four minute mile. What he
does tomorrow remains to be seen.

“Sunday, I ran a workout for
the coach,” explained Richey,
“and I lookedvpretty sharp. I
guess he changed his mind and fi-
gured he’d try me in the 1500
meters. I was entered in the 15-
00, 5000, and 10,000.

“Gerry Lindgren won the 10,-
000 by a lot,” he continued. “Dur-
ing cross country I beat the fel-
low who finished second. but I’m
glad I didn’t run it anyway."

Ruchey is a very confident run-
ner, and he’s not too worried a-
bout tomorrow's finals.

“I hat qualifiers,” he remarked.
“They’re terrible. You can't get
your self pstched - up like on the
day of a meet. You never know
when some guy you never heard
of is going to come along and
beat you.

The long recruiting haul came to a close May 22, and football
coach Dave Hart and his assistants have a list of 32 freshmen, who. on
paper, look as good as or better than last year’s crew. And quite a few
of last year’s group are expected to start this fall.

Not all of the 32 are on football scholarships. For instance. Willie
Saliky and Dave Young were recruited mainly by wrestling coach Dave

Adams.

The recruits come from as far west as Michigan and as far south as
Florida. Seventeen of the 32 come from out of state, and eight of those

come from Ohio.

Of those boys who originally planned to enroll here next fall, only
one failed to sign on May 22. Halfback Ed Placheki decided to attend
Penn State instead. Meanwhile Bill Donovan, bound for Penn State,
changed to Pitt. Donovan is a Big 33 halfback from Baldwin.

. Also changing his mind was Joe Carrol, originally going to Notre

ame.

The 1968 freshmen will be Dave Hart’s third class of recruits. He
expects to have enough varsity players to free the freshmen to work on
their own, rather than hold tackling dumies for the varsity.

The frosh will again play the freshmen from West Virginia. Penn
State, and Ohio State; but Notre Dame dropped off the schedule. and
the squad will meet the Kent State freshmen as they did two years ago.

F or Spring

A fast finish by the baseball
team enabled the spring sports
to finish with an overall winning
record, the only season to do so
this year. Coach Bobby Lewis’

mitters won their last seven gam-
es to close the season ay 16-9.

The overall spring sports slate
reads 30-28. The tennis team was
7-8. the golfers 6-9, and the track
team 1-2.

The highlights of the baseball
season include double wins over
arch rivals Penn State and Syra-
cuse and single wings in the Riv-
erside Invitational Tournament
over Tennessee. Kansas. and even-
tual champion UCLA.

The record of the track team
is also deceptive. ‘A lack of depth
has many times overshadowed
some outstanding performances.
The loss to Temple, by 11 points
occurred before any of the sopho-
mores became eligible to compete.
They have made a substantial dif-
ference since becoming eligible.

Also. the other loss — to Penn
State - is listed for the Quandrang-
ular meet. The won-lost record
does not reflect that the thin-
clads finished ahead of Syracuse
and West Virginia by large mar-
gins. —

In most cases. rain prevent-
ed the records from being better
due to the cancellation of several
events.

 

           
  
 

 

Friday, June 14, 1968-THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

Springtime is a hazy lazy time
normally. But this Spring was
somewhat different. The sun
never seemed to Come out this
spring. Rain. Rain. Rain. that was
the month of May. That continu-
ous rain in the May made many
students think of the Lord‘s War»
ning to Noah. Some people
thought that the rain would never
let up. "Hey manf Niaybe all
this rain is that 40 days and 40
nightjazz.“

The Serendipity Singers performed at Mini - Spring Weekend.

But June was a better month.
The sun finally came out and the
sun worshipers took to the roof
tops and Trees Pool. And then
there was the spring min—week~
end and the Serendipity Singers
were pretty good. But they wemit
that great either '

All in all this spring has been
sort of a drag. But we must make
our good times for ourselves.
Right?
