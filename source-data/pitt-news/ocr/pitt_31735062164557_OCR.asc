He added: “This statement reﬂects one approach to the

cheating problem. This is the faculty’s View since few un-
dergraduates have seen the statement. But it is hoped that
student proposals will be united with this policy.”

The Educational Policy Committee began the study last
summer when students and Dean Helen Pool Rush, dean of

students,“ requested an official
University policy on academic in-
tegrity. Several drafts of the pol-
icy were written and handed to
a University Senate Council in
November.

The committee’s ﬁnal draft fo-
cuses on the instructor and aca-
demic dean for enforcement. If
a student is caught cheating, the
instructor reports him to his dean

l who may have the student ap-
-- pear before an honors committee

or enforce a traditional penalty.
The individual deans are-free, ac-
cording to the overall policy, to
modify their means of enforce-
ment. ‘

The draft represents a trial
policy which is still open to sug-
gestions or changes. The trial

NAACP to Sponsor Drive

Group to Collect
Materials, Funds

The University chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) is sponsoring a drive to
collect necessary materials and funds for
NAACP volunteers working in Mississippi.

According to Ralph Proctor, executive
secretary of the University chapter, books,
any educational materials, newspapers, food,
canned goods, clothing, money, shoes, and any-

-thing in fairly decent shape, can be used by the

volunteers.

“We want the help of all student organiza-
tions on campus, in hopes that we wi‘ll be able to
draw from a larger segment of the University
population than previously possible,” Proctor said.

Trucks carrying the goods are scheduled to
leave on March,19 and April 23. “We hope, if the
University student body responds well,” said Proc-
tor “to sponsor another trip between these two.
The program will only be limited by the imagina--

tion of the students.”

The “drop zones” for collection of the ma-
terials will be located at the Student Desk, in the
Cathedral of Learning, in the Student’ Union, and

in the Towers.

An open meeting to discuss the drive will be
held today at noon in 419, SU. Further informa-
tion is available at Exts. 7255 and 7419.

Chaplain Took Part

In Vote Registration

By RUTH LEVIKOFF
Reverend Edward C. Biegert, University
chaplain of the Presbyterian United Church
of Christ, joined ministers from all parts of
the United States in the Negro voter regis-

tration in Selma, Alabama, last Tuesday.
Tuesday’s demonstration was the second at-

tempt of the Negro citizens of Selma to march to
Montgomery, the state capital. The ﬁrst attempt
on Sunday ended in violence when state troopers,
using tear gas and clubs, dispersed the marchers.

Approximately 500 religious leaders from all
over the country, many of whom left with only
a few hours’ notice, participated in the hope that
their presence would  the chance of a_
riot. They also sought to
focus the nation’s atten-
tion on the issue.

These two aims were
realized, but the march
itself did not reach its
goal —- Montgomery. The
District Federal Court had
ordered the demonstrators
not to march. Even though
an agreement was work-

ed out with the court and EDWARD C. BIEGERT

Freshman‘ Camp will be
held Labor Day Weekend
(Sept. 4 through 6) at Camp
Kon - O - Kwee according to

' the Dean of Men’s Office.

The traditional program is
sponsored by the University
YMCA and the Dean of Men’s
Oﬂice. '

This year a new program of
discussions by students, faculty,
and administrators will be added
to the fun, recreation, and school
spirit typical of Summer Camp.
The purpose of these discussions
is ‘to give the individual fresh-
man an opportuni_ty to meet and
know students and staff and to
understand their viewpoints on
campus life and his part in it.

Camp participants will be di-
vided into four teams to take
part in a series of athletic events,

spirit demonstrations, and other ‘

group projects to compete for
the outstanding team trophy.

John Vrana, outgoing Student
Government president, has been
active in the past in the Fresh-
man Camp program. Vrana stated,
“I think Freshman Camp is the
most valuable experience for a

 Plan Freshman Camp

 
  

  

freshman during his ﬁrst week
of school. It provides an oppor-
tunity for entering freshmen to
become acclimated to University
life and make friends.

Student leaders are working
out details for Freshman Camp
with the Dean of Men’s staﬁ
members and Frank Watanabe,
YMCA executive. Applications
for counselorships can be picked
up in the Dean of Men’s Office,
505 SU, or from the presidents
of IFC, Men’s Dorm Council, or
the Men’s Council. Over 50 staff
openings are available, and ap-
plicants are requested to sign up
as soon as possible. Counselor ap-
plications must be in by March
15 and head counselor and pro-
gram chairman applicants must
apply by March 20.

Frank Watanabe, YMCA execu-
tive and Freshman Camp advi-
sor, commented in regard to the
upcoming Camp. “The boost
which the upperclassman can
give to the new student as he
enters Pitt can be one of the high
marks of school spirit, because
of a willingness to share some
of his campus experiences.”

Clark Kerr, President of
the University of California,
and Martin Meyerson, Act-
ing Chancellor of its Berke-
-ley campus, announced Tues-
day evening that they had
submitted their resignations

Throughout the fall semester,

the Berkely campus was the
scene of demonstrations in op-

position to the university's re-

strictions on student political ac-
tivity. The resignations of Pres-
ident Kerr and Dr. Meyerson
come at a time when student
agitation is at its lowest point of
the academic year. '

Kerr and Meyerson'were critical
of the students who played an
active role in the fall rebellion.
It is assumed, however, that the
resignations were prompted by a
general atmosphere of student
and faculty resentment of the
administration's policies prohibit-
ing fund-raising and recruitment

itical activity.

Dr. Kerr became Chancellor of
Berkeley in 1952 and led the uni-
versity through its loyalty-oath
controversy. He was appointed

President of the University of
California in 1958.

Dr. Meyerson was recently ap-

a December sit-in demonstration
which led to the arrests of some
800 students. The student revolt
subsided, however, between the
Christmas vacation and -ﬁnal ex-

. The temper of the recent Student Government election was an elec-

tric one of ACTION—NOW spurred by president-elect Eric Stern and the

. aggressive Pitt Progressive Party. Student Government has been too
possessed by perennial problems such as Homecoming and parking, the
majority of voting students declared, and hasn't seen clear enough to take

real leadership in meaningful issues such as civil rights.

The events of the last week in Alabama highlighted by an ap-
peal. from the NAACP for supplies for the Mississippi workers throws
out an immediate opportunity to see this philosophy put to work. Ralph
Proctor, executive secretary of the University chapter of the NAACP,
said as much when he appealed to the Student Affairs meeting Tuesday:
the students have been pleading for action and student leadership to show
. _ them where the ﬂags are. Here is the most obvious place to start.

Stern, naturally was enthusiastic, but he was only one of several
new student leaders who have masses of students directly under their line

More Comment
About Stem

C Editor.‘ The Pitt News:

Concerning recent anti -Eric

Stern letters to the Editor, a few ‘

things should be pointed out._

Stern and others were elected
in a democratic fashion. All those
who won the election ﬁled peti-

 tions and presented themselves

and their platforms to the elec-
torate. Candidates who received
the most ‘votes were declared
winners. It is really quite sim-
ple; we have subscribed to this
system in the United States for
quite a few years.

But it is the system only good
if the candidate you support is
elected? What do you do if some-
one gets in who you do not want?
You can exercise your freedom
of expression by writing a “Let-

? . ter to the Editor” decrying the

newly elected or by throwing
a temper tantrum on the Cathe-
dral lawn (both methods are

 35013 equally constitutional and
" Jcoustructlve). '

 

Comments such as, “Would you
like Stern to represent you at

« a White House reception?” fall

into the category‘ of, “What
would you do if your daughter
wanted to marry Eh°ic Stern?” In
fact certain writers, in their fury,
have presented subtle implica-
tions about Stern ranging from

his hygienic motivation to his.

political affiliations.

Rumors are vicious instruments
used by vicious people. Like cells
of a small cancer they spread
and become more dangerous as
they grow. A rumor is not a can-
cer of only one person’s mind,
but of scores. Some people get
cured, but many do not. This
letter brings no cure for that
cancer which a few students wish
to spread on this campus. Rather,
I question the good intentions of
those people who in one breath
speak as though they support a
democratic system, as though
they believe that the Student
Government could inﬂuence the
university environment —— and in
the same breath slander those
who were elected by this sys-
tem, demonstrate their resis-

tance, and in effect work to in- .

capacitate the Student Govern-
ment.

If these people have any gen-
uine interest in a university gov-
ernment that is of, by, and for
the students, then‘ it behooves
them to accept the principles by
which it was founded and - to
work with it in that framework.

Eric Stern is president-elect,

the PPP is the incoming majority
party. This is a fact. It is also .a
fact that student interest may be
presented to this university gov-
ernment. If! it is demonstrated
that a substantial number of stu-
dents have an interest in a given

_ area,‘the action may be taken on

such proposals. There are few
other ways that student inﬂuence
may be aﬂectively felt on this
campus. The alternatives: nega-
tivism, prejudice and rumors,
like cancer, have one common
product-—waste. ~

Prof Defends it
Frank Carver

Editor, The Pitt News:

A short time ago I read in the
Letters to the Editor column a
particularly mindless attack up-
on Athletic Director Frank Car-
ver. As a sports enthusiast of
long standing, I would like to
come to the support of Frank
Carver. We are very fortunate
to have an athletic director who
can keep the role of athletics in
proper perspective. Big time ath-

' letics? Who needs it?

The athletic department has
some perfectly _valid functions in
a university. The department can
study the relation of athletics to
other spheres ofhuman activity.
It can study the physiology and

. psychology of the athletic per- ,

formance and competition. As a
logical service it can provide the
facilities for all of us to be more
efficient people by virtue of exer-
cise and intramural athletic com-
petition. Finally the department
of athletics has the responsibil-
ity for developing teachers, coach-
es and technicians in physical
education.

Dr. Carver has an excellent
approach toward intercollegiate
athletics. As long as the varsity
teams are competing primarily
as a student activity that the

students and the faculty want, 

they should continue to exist.
The studentswcan show that their
attachment to a varsity team
really means something by at-
tending games whether the team
is winning or losing. The students
can show that varsity sports
mean something in terms of stu-
dent life by going out for the
team and by playing intramural
sports.

” Without student support based
on a natural interest in partici-
pating in exercise and in sports,
the cry for recruitment and win-
ning teams becomes an ugly
sound on the campus. With the

kind of support indicated, the

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

student athlete will come to

Pittsburgh because it’s the place
he.wants to be—not because the
coach gave him a better deal.

Frank Carver’s public state-
ments (1 do not know him per-
sonally.) have indicated to_ me
that he would like to have his
budget based upon the intrinsic
value of developing sound bodies
along with educated minds. Of
the athletic directors I have
known and read about, Frank
Carver is one of the best. If stu-
dent, alumni or other pressures
bring him down, the athletic de-
partment and the university will
be the worse for it.

8.) Can Mr. Barton be seriously
suggesting that idealism has no
place on a college campus?
Have we grown so cynical and
and worldly that we must con-
tain ourselves within a castle of
pragmatism? It may be true that
the majority of students do not
care who represents them. None
the less it is abundantly clear
that those who do‘ care are more
interested in ideas than in images,
more interested in what a Stu-
dent Government president can
do for the university than in

  

of communication. Associated Womenistudents and Housing Board could
easily place boxes in each dormitory lobby; each dormitory president enlist
the help of Dormitory Council representatives to solicit from t-he individual
ﬂoors. Men's Dorm Council, especially considering the House system of
organization, could follow a similar procedure of collection. ,_

Likewise Panhel and IFC presidents could contact the president‘s"‘
of each group to make a strong appeal at Monday night's meetings, not to
mention the job the men could do searching their fraternity houses as a
unit for contributions. '

Student Union Board and Student Government could organize other
centers of collection and along with every other student organization solicit
from among their own membership. The amountof imagination, as Proctor
said,-that could be directed to this project is endless, and with each leader ‘.5’
contacting his own area the results could "be overwhelming.

Action is no longer a political issue: it is here now for the taking.

Or has Mr. Barton forgotten
that there are also academic re-

like to remind him that Melville,

Chaplain Joins Ministers

In Vote Registration March

(Continued from Page 1)
the march began at 2 p.m., high-
way patrolmen stopped the 3,000
marchers right outside of Selma.
At this point, rather than resist
the authorities, the protesters
knelt and sang, freedom songs.

Later the same afternoon, the
marchers returned to Selma
where they held a rally. At the
rally, religious and civil rights
leaders, including such distin-
guished men as Martin Luther
King, Jr., chairman of the South-
ern Christian Leadership Coun-
cil; James Farmer, director of
CORE; and Robert Spike, head of

the National Council of Church-
es, explained that they had stop-
ped the march because they de-
sired to - prevent violence.

They outlined their plans for

future action. On Thursday the
leaders will appeal to the Fed-
eral Court for permission to
march all the way to the state
capital. ‘ -
Reverend Biegert, executive as
well as chairman of the Reli-
gion and Race Council of the
Greater Pittsburgh area, feels
that permission will be granted
and that the march will take
place on Monday.

A NEW PROGRAM OF INTEREST T0

 

It isn’t easy to become an officer in the United
States Army. Only the best young men, are selected.
The training and course of study are demanding.

But if you can qualify———and you should ﬁnd out
if you can,—you will receive training which will put
you a step ahead of other college graduates. Army
ROTC training will give you experience that most
college graduates do not get—in leading and man-
aging other men, in organizational techniques, in
self-discipline and in speaking on your feet. This
.kind of experience will pay off in everything you

 

do the rest of your life.

Army ROTC has a new program designed spe-
ciﬁcally for outstanding men who already have
two years of college, and plan.to continue their
college work. During your junior and senior years
in this program, you will receive $40 per month.
Want to ﬁnd out more about the program? Simply
send in the coupon below, or see the Professor of
Military Science if you are now attending an-
ROTC college. There’s no obligation——except the

one you owe to yourself.

Mazurek to Football

BY TOM SACKS

Fred Mazurek, who batted .377 and .366 in successive
seasons, has a season of eligibility remaining in baseball,

but he will not be playing.

His reason is a professional football contract recently
offered by the Washington Redskins. His decision to forfeit
baseball might have been influenced by the newly installed

Major League open draft which
will eliminate the soaring bonus
offers.

“He probably would have been
picked by some team, but may-
be the Redskin offer was to at-
tractive to pass up,” said coach
Bobby Lewis. “He leaves a gap
that’s going to be hard to "ﬁll.
Besides being great offensively,
he was a real reliable center

ﬁelder with amazing speed.”

’+

   

Mazurek’s loss simply adds to
the already long list of spots that
must be ﬁlled this year. Only
four letter-men — Barry Wetzel,
Dave Blyshak, Steve Eiseman and
Doug Chambers — are returning
from last year's squad which
posted a 9-13 record.

Blyshak and Lee Brueckel, who
lettered the year before last, will
form the nucleus of the pitching
staff with four spots open for
grabs. One of them might be ﬁll-
ed by Eiseman, who normally
plays second base.

Wetzel, who at .317 was the
second leading hitter last year,
will either take over at ﬁrst base

or someplace in the outﬁeld.
Chambers, outstanding as a de-
fensive catcher had a poor sea-
son hitting last year.

“I’m looking for Doug to come
back,” said Lewis. “In college
ball that only lasts six weeks if
you get 01! to a bad start that’s
it. The season's too short to break
a slump.”

“Those out for the squad are
predominantly sophomores,” Lew-

is said. “There’s a lot of enthusi- ‘

asm because there are so many
spots open and it keeps them
hustling.”

As soon as the weather breaks,
coach Lewis plans to shift to the
outside to prepare for the April
19 opener at George Washington.
The ﬁrst home appearance will
be a double-header with Syra-
cuse, April 24.

Until the weather does break,_

the Panthers will be forced to
conﬁne themselves to loosening
up and a little bit of practice in

the batting cage in the Field _

House.

‘Any Wednesday’

By BARRY SHAW
Any Wednesday is a comedy in action only, for in its ﬁnal message,
it touches on some of the more complex problems of our “affluent” society.
It is now playing, until Monday, at the Nixon Theatre, downtown.

. Brieﬂy, Any,Wednesday is the story of a wealthy businessman,
John Cleves, his mistress, Ellen Gordon, and his wife. The illicit romance
that John and Ellen carry on on the Wednesdays that John can make it to
the executive suite is a delight to them both.

But as soon as Mrs. Cleves, with the aid of Mr. Cleves’ business associate, Cass
Henderson, ﬁnds out about the situation, she insists on a divorce. Thus, Cleves must
marry Ellen Gordon. All of a sudden, Mr. Cleves is no longer interested in his pretty
little mistress; he can have her any time.

His "attention, towards the end of the play, is directed towards his former wife-

again. These direct references to Cleves’ desire to want only what he can’t have, make
Any Wednesday a play intinntely concerned with the inability of the “organization
man” to stay in love.

The play, however, is still a comedy, and a frequently amusing one at that.
Larry Parks plays Mr. Cleves, and does .a ﬁne job portraying an efficient, well-adjusted
businessman. He is conservative in dress and action, expect when the play tries to
bring out his true colors.

Thus, in the party scene, the underlying childishness of Mr. Cleves is illustrated
by his whining insistence on beginning, and winning, all the party games. Parks
transition from the sophisticated Cleves to the childlike one is done superbly.

Patricia Cutts plays Mrs. Cleves, and also turns in a ﬁne job. She is the perfect
counterpart to her husband, with a affected accent and all; yet she has that extra
bit of insight into things that her husband completely lacks. She is, in her.ow'n way,
a kind woman, and Miss Cutts brings all of this forth on stage. ,

However, it is Richard Roat, as Cass Henderson, who steals the show. Roat
had the right timing to suit his movements, and the right expressions to suit his
attitudes, thus making the more comic aspects of the show even funnier. In fact, con-
trasted to Mr. and Mrs. Cleves, Roat appears as a perfectly natural and lovable buﬁoon.

In one particularly funny scene, Cleves is forced into dining with his wife
and his mistress, while Henderson doubles as the extra husband. Henderson turns to
Cleves and says, with a sarcastic smile and a jiggle of his hands, “It’s sort of like

a ‘double date.”’

Even with this ﬁne cast, however, the show is not a total success. Part of this
can be blamed on Monica, Moran, as Ellen Gordon. Actually, Miss Moran's part is
the most important one in the whole show, and the fact that her comic ability is
not quite up to par, really is a, detraction. She just does not have the quality of hold-
ing the show together that Sandy Dennis did in the Broadway production.

First of all, her timing could be better. In trying to portray a naive and inno-
cent girl, Moran is purposely “cute,” in a manner that soon seems overdone.

Thus, while she is satisfactory, Miss Moran just does assume the leading role
that she is supposed to, so that the burden of the humor falls, instead, on Roat’s
shoulders. Mor.an’s failure proves to highlight the supreme importance of a leading
lady, especially if she is a humorous character.
