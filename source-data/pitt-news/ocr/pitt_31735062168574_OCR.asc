_ of the St_u_dent.ID Card, ,

by GEORGE EDELMAN
Last Thursday’s meeting
of the Men’s Dormitory
Council coincided with the

end of the self-imposed four
week suspension of the lit-

erature distribution .rules.
Thirty-four out of 37 senators
democratically killed a Towers
Opinion P011 to gauge the atti-
tudes of Towers’ residents on
the much-discussed literature dis-
tribution issue. The idea of a
formal poll was proposed by
MDC Senator Steven Hecht at a
rather lengthy meeting on Octo-
ber 13.

Thomas Meisner, president of
MDC, ended the poll issue by

saying the “Senators felt they al-
ready knew what the men they
represented wanted}? A decision
was enacted to retain the-policy
before the suspension period be-
gan, therefore, literaturecan not
be distributed to the individual
rooms. 1

For their coming “Dorm Week-
end,” February 23 to 25, MDC

hadlsubmitted a request for $3,-'

216 to the Allocations Committee
of Student Government. This re-
quest was refused and MDC pre-
pared a new emergency request
of $3,421 for consideration. Again,
this request was refused, and the
Allocations Committee is now
considering a $2,500 budget for
the proposed Dorm Weekend. A

Negroes Hit Plans
, Made for Kings Visit

“We the Negro students of the
University of Pittsburgh insist
that Dr. Martin Luther King be
accorded by the University the
accommodations beﬁtting a
World Figure and a winner of
the Noble Peace Prize.”

This is the \text of a petition,
signed by Negro students, which
will be presented to Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Helen P. Rush today
by Earl Trent and Beth Ann
Waithe, Negro undergraduates.

In a statement to the Pitt News,
Trent complained that no Negro
students had been invited _to
greet Dr. King at the airport or
to meet him at the post-lecture
luncheon (see lead story on this
page). The statement also took
exception to bringing King to the
University in a Mustang automo-
bile, rather than in a limousine.

Competition

The Women’s Press Club's an-

nual Gertrude Gordon Journalism.

Competition, a contest open to
all junior and senior women stu-
dents attending colleges in Pitts-
burgh and the Tri-State area, will
be held at noon Saturday in the
Pittsburgh‘ Post-Gazette editorial
room.

Each contestant will partici-
pate in a group interview of tele-
vision and night club entertainer
Frank Gorshin, ‘and then write
an on-the-spot story.

The deadline for entering is
today. Entry blanks may be ob-
tained at the Office of Student
Publications, 405 SU. Cash prizes
will be awarded for the best
stories.

HOMEMING TICKETS
Homecoming tickets will be
sold Monday in the Marble
Lounge SU from 11 a.m. to 8
p.m. One ticket will be allowed
net person upon presentation

A list of students invited to the
luncheon was not available. But
Peggy Wolak, chairman of the

_Public Affairs -Committee of the

Student Union Board, said that
students Weren’t picked to at-
tend the luncheon on whether

they were Negroes or not. There

was no way, except through per-
sonal acquaintance, that..she
couild know the race of appli-
cants for the luncheon, said
Miss Wolak.

The transportation_ planned to
bring King from the airport (the
Mustang) “is equivalent to Lyn-
don Johnson and Lady Bird rid-
ing through Thailand on a Hon-
da,” contends Trent. A Mustang,
says Trent, “is associated. with
the popular vulgarity of the low-
er echelon of the white commun-

—ity.” Trent plans to takea sep-

arate trip to the Greater Pitts-
burgh Airport with other Negro
students and let King decide
“whether he wants to ride with
the Whites or the Blacks.”

Dr. Martin Luther King  
Talks at Midday Series  

On‘WorldinTransition’

The Public Affairs Midday Series
will sponsor a lecture by Dr.
Martin Luther King on “A World’
in Transition” Wednesday at
noon in the SU Ballroom.

Dr. King is themost well-known

ﬁgure in the world in the ﬁeld »

of civil rights. One of his major
distinctions is the award of the
1964 Noble Peace Prize. He was
nominated for the Prize because
“he had succeeded in keeping his‘
followers to the principles of non-
violence.” He was the third Ne-
gro,‘the 12th American, and the
youngest person (he was born in
1929) to receive the award since
Alfred Nobel instituted it in 1895.

Office Of Student Records

Announces Innovations

by ALAN DISLER

The Office of Student Records
will institute several innovations
next term “so that students may
register earlier and have a better
selection of courses,” according
to John B. Herron, director of
Student Records.

Henceforth, all advisers will
be ‘informed daily which courses
and sections have been closed
that day. Each day, a card with
newly closed courses indicated
will be sent to each advisor. Also,
advisers will be notiﬁed by tele-
phone as much as possible in
order to be kept more up to date
with closing sections.

In addition, Student Records
will print a weekly bulletin list-
ing all closed sections for each
week.

Student Records also plans to
facilitate the registration process

by instituting a system whereby
students will receive a card in
the mail after they register with
their advisors, listing the courses
Student Records has them offi-
cially registered for.

Should any covnﬂict or ommis-
sion appear, the student can re-
turn the card with the correc-
tions made. In this way, students
will not have to wait until in-
voiced to correct their registra-
tion records.

Herron said that studentswill
receive cards for the Winter term
in the middle of November, but
in subsequent terms the cards
should be received no later than
ten days after elections have
been made with the advisers.

Commenting on this term’s reg-
istration, Herron stated that “reg-
istration is way up. It behooves
students to see their advisor early

A Fable

- ONCE UPON a time, dur-
-ing the ‘reign of King Fabi-
an in the village of Umouse-
ville, the King’s Council of
Ministers had its weekly
meeting in the castle dining
room. The First Minister,
Bosso Machiavelli, who pre-
sided, opened the meeting

with his usual remark: “Off '

with their heads!”

“Shut up, stupid,” answer-
ed the boy-wonder king. Af-
ter an inspirational ‘message
from King Fabian, First

‘Minister Bosso Machiavelli

announced the agenda; they
were going to discuss the
decisions made by his Maj es-
ty’s Funds Committee: this
committee was formed to

- distribute the money collect-

ed from the village head tax.
The committee spokesman,
Logic-al Sam, an old man who
used to be town crier, an-
nounced that his_ committee
had decided not to give the
Umouseville Army any mon-
ey. The Army wanted to
have a Umouseville Service
Organization (USO) show.
“OF WITH your head!’?

~ Bosso Machiavelli.

“Shut up, stupid," replied
King Fabian.

General Boswell, represent-
ing the Army, stood up to
speak. “Why can't we have
a USO show for the men ?”
he cried, shaken with anger.

“The men’s morale is terri- .

ble, and we wanted to have
a USO show before we send
them off to ﬁght in South
Variana.” The South Vari-
anese farmers, allies of the
village, were ﬁghting the
People’s Republic of North
V ariana.

“WE DON’T support that

‘ war, anyway !” -shouted a lit-

tle man sitting on the fringe
of the audience. “I think the
Associated Peaceful Vil-
lagers should get all of the
money.” Speaking with Flap-
pingmouth, a member of the
previous year’s council. All
of the villagers thought that
Flappingmouth wanted to be
the next king. He was the
head of PLOP, the People’s
Littler Organizers of Peti-
tions, a group formed to an-
tagonize the Army. PLOP
was trying to convince the
Army that Flappingmouth

should be permitted to stuff i

his campaign leaﬂets under

-the soldiers’ tent ﬂaps. ‘.‘W’e
~ .PLOPs are being oppressed,"

   

A Final W

The Men’s Dormitory Council (MDC) took the logical step when it
discontinued its suspension of distribution rules. However it seems both
illogical and unreasonable that they were unwilling to test out the decision
4. with a poll of the male residents of the dormitories.

The recent opening of the student mailboxes to free distribution
makes the need for door to door dormitory dessimination a minor one. Now
any recognized organization can have folded leaflets put into all the dormi-
tory mailboxes. The University Mail Service recently agreed to provide _
this service. Other alternatives to distribution include passing out litera-
ture in the Towers lobby and the setting up of booths in the lobby area.
During the Student Government election campaign the distribution rules
. ‘in the Towers will be suspended. If members of political party want to
reach the dorm residents during the evening in the campaign, they will be
able to slip pamphlets under doors. ,

With all the alternatives open to those wishing to reach dorm resi-
dents it seemed unncessary to open the Towers year round to free dessim-
ination above the lobby floor. It was clear that the majority of the male
residents of the Towers felt this was an invasion of their privacy and was
often disturbing during study hours. The Pitt News received mo-re letters

continued Flappingmouth.

“Off with your head, scoun-
drel !” said Bosso Machiavelli.
This time the boy-wonder
King Fabian said nothing;
he was asleep. The castle
guards seized Flappingmouth
and chopped off his head . . .
plop. ' '

“I object,” said one of the
Ministers. This time it was
Cassius Nailman, a Minister
elected that year even though
he was not a member of the
King’s Party, Citizens for an
End to Rule by Tireless Ad-
jitators and Incompetent No-

bodys (CERTAIN). Cassius ‘

Nailman had just commuted
the sentence of his scribe,
Pressurecooker, who had
joined the opposition, and
was ‘jailed by Nailman.

THE OTHER Ministers
did not like Nailman because

they thought that he, too,“

wanted to be King. The Vil-
lagers were very funny about
their elections. Eve1'ytime
someone announced his can-
didacy earlier than everyone
else he lost his head; this
had been proven the year be-
fore.

Little Minister Pollax, the
King’s brother, stood up, hit
the Nailman on the head,
and said: “You’re no good,
Nailman. You just want to
be King someday, and this
is the way you’re announc-
ing it.” All of the Ministers

In all probability, a poll of the dorm residents would have demon-

strated their strong opposition to such aepolicy. But because MDC has

decided against taking this poll the element of doubt remains. If the MDC
senators truly represent the opinion of the male residents, then any opinion
gauge would be just as one sided as was their vote on the poll. ‘
The Towers Opinion Poll would have been very simple to carry out.
The questionnaire could have presented the alternatives of dessimination

sponses to be calculated. The senators from each house could easily have

hissed and shook their ﬁsts
at Nailman. Little Pollax had
just conducted a poll among
the villagers to see if he was
popular enough to be King
next time.

“I agree with Minister Pol-
lax,” said Castor, the Sec-
ond Minister. “That guy
knows he couldn’t beat me in
an election for King.” Now
all the Ministers hissed and
shook their ﬁrsts at Minis-
ter Castor.

LITTLE MISS Winch rep-

, resenting His Majesty’s Loy-

all Opposition, jumped up
and ‘said: “I am appalled!
Flappingmouth would have
been a great king. He was a

friend of our fallen leader-

Secondbanana, the co-organ-
izer of PLOP." The Minis-
ters laughed at the little
Winch because they knew
she represented a lost cause
—Secondbanana had feet of
clay.

“Stop this bickering,” yell-
ed King Fabian, “and don’t
let it happen again!” The
Council of Ministers voted to
accept the committee’s deci-
sion and the Umouseville
Army was sent to Variana
without a USO show to boost
their morale.

Unfortunately, all of the
candidates were beheaded a.
year later‘ when an unknown
bearded king was elected,
and the Villagers lived un-
happily ever after. ‘

could. have been the coup de grace to those who argue that there is a need
for distribution above the Towers l-ob-by. However it is clear in the end
the dessimination issue is a dead one. Sufficient doors are now open to
student organizations to demonstrate that freedom of expression is a
principle practiced at the University.

The Tower’s Policy

by  MESINER
President
of Men’s Dormitory Council

Approximately four weeks
ago, one section of the Tow-
ers Policy was suspended so
that literature could be dis-
tributed directly to the rooms

above the Main lobby in the
Last Thurs-
day this trial period ended, and

with its conclusion followed the"-

decision_ of Men’s Dormitory

A Council (MDC) not to make the

suspension permanent, but in-
stead to keep the policy that had
been suspended. Literature may
not be distributed above the lob-
by to the rooms of the men’s
dormitories.

Altough the Towers policy has
many aspects, the section con-
cerning the distribution of litera-
ture has created th'e most con-
troversy. Literature may be dis-
tributed, unhindered, at any

‘time, anywhere in the To_wers

Lobby-by any student. A table
is available in the Lobby for or-
ganizations to place their litera-
ture so the students can pick it
up. Booths may also be used. Dur-
ing the calendar week preceding
S t u d e n t Government elections,
campaign literature may be dis-
tributed directly to the rooms
above the Lobby.

Finally, any recognized student

organization may leave unad-
dressed literature in the Mail
Room to be put into the dorm
residents mail boxes. It need only
be folded so it ﬁts into the mail
boxes. By these means, especially
the Mail Room, every male resi-
dent can be reached. They make
the direct distribution to the

"rooms unnecessary. In addition

to being unnecessary, direct dis-
tribution is an unwanted invasion
of the privacy of the men’s liv-
ing areas. Primarily, though, it is
an unnecessary invasion.

Last Thursday, MDC decided
to keep this policy. The formal
poll that was going to be taken
was decided against because the
Senators felt that they already
knew what the men they repre-
sented wanted.

If the men who are directly
effected by this policy and the

men who represent them both
want this policy, then who ac-
tually opposes it. It is apparent
that the main opponents of this
policy are John Ruskay and Mah-
mood Mamdani (neither of whom
lives in the dorms) and the PPP.
Their stand is questionable due
to at least three incidents.

First, during the open, student
subcommittee meetings of the
Towers—Quadrangle Committee in

the winter trimester, John Rus-

kay was asked what should be
done if the men indicate (as they
had then and do now) that they
do-n’t want literature distributed
to their rooms. His answer, in
effect, was that the men’s opinion
should be‘ ignored because the
ideal of free speech was more
important.
did not disagree with him. Now,
the freedom of speech is not be-
ing violated.

Second, in a letter to the Pitt

, News (April 4, 1966) Mahmood

‘Mamdani wrote that “a strong‘
recommendation to the Dean of
Student Affairs to advice the
MDC to radically liberalize its
rules above the second floor” had
been made by the Tower-Quad-
rangle Committee. This was not

true because no such recommen- _
. -‘\

dation was made.

The third incident was a full-
page ad that appeared in the Pitt
News on October 10, 1966. The
basis of the ad was that ,“reg-
ulations prohibiting the distribu-
tion of literature directly to the
student rooms exist only in the
men’s dorms (no such rule exists

‘in the women’s dorrns).” This

contention also was not true as
was pointed out in-the Pitt News
on October 14, 1966, by the chair-
man of the Women’s Housing
Board. Thus the well-meaning
students and faculty who signed
the ad were deceived.

These incidents and the policy
itself speak for themselves. MDC
has not nor wil it ignore the
opinions of tlhe men that it rep- .
resents. The men have indicated
right along that they want this
policy, which insures their pri-
vacy, contributes to the dorm’s
security and enables the effective
distribution of literature.

Second At Canisius

Although the cross-country team has only partici-
pated in six‘ meets, they have amassed a record .of 23 wins
and only three losses. Well, not really, 19 of those “vic-
tories” were gained last Saturday at the Canisius Invi-
tational Cross-Country‘Run in Buffalo, New York.

Only the University of Tpronto,-‘ among the twenty-
one ‘teams participating in tlie.,,meet, finished ahead of
the distancemen. Dave Bailey of Toronto took ﬁrst place
and-broke the. 4.6 mile course record with a time of
22:00.2. _ ‘ ‘ ‘

‘However, all five of the harriers finished among the

firstinineteen places with Frank Handelman finishing -
with a time. of 22:25. Fran. Shor, Larry Hubner, Paul_ .

Greig, and Ken Lawton finished ‘ninth, 14th, 17th, and
19th, respectively. ..

Coach Banner was particularly pleased with the indi-
vidual performances of all the boys, ‘especially Lawton

Coach Banner said, “I was real pleased, with all the

Oss to Syracuse  

Orange Running GameHandcuffed
Despite What Score Might Indicate

by TOM SACKS
SYRACUSE, N. Y. -— It was the night before
the Syracuse game. About eight players were sit-
ting around ‘one of the -dinner tables when some-
one mentioned the Mt. Lebanon-Baldwin game be-

ing played that night. And that started them talk- ‘

ing about the memoriesof their own high school
football games.‘ '

They. were searching for something to keep
their minds off the upcoming game. Theywere also
searching for? something ‘to buildup their own
pride—a pride which has been severely challenged
during theirs as college players. :

A There wasn’t much" question as to who would
win the Syracuse game. Ben Schwartzwalder’s
Orangemen were favored by 27 points.- They are
tough and mean—a lot more vicious than Notre
Dame in most estimates. The big question prior
to this game was just how badly would the Pan-
hers be humiliated, Both Navy and Army had
run over them. They had been ﬂat in those two
games and now it was Syracuse’s turn.

As expected, Syracuse won, 33-7. But this time

..;you .;were left with a different feeling. Despite

1what"tl1e score indicates, the Panther defense more
‘than "held its own. , I ' j_

They held the Orangemen to_ their lowest rush-

ing yardage of the season. Floyd Little, two time

All-America, gained 43 yards in V12 carries. This

‘ had been the game tabbed as the one "in ‘which
_.\Little would explode. He didn’t come close.

Larry" Csonka, their big, bruising fullback,
grounded out 22 yards on his first two carries. For
the rest of the game he traveled 54 yards‘ in 15
carries. -

At -halftime the score was 26-0. Two touch-

byMIKEBROURMAN

deal them their ﬁfth loss of the

West Virginia

downs had been set up by a fumble and an inter-

cepted pass. The’ other scores were the results of

long-bombs which got behind Bobby Dyer.
During the third quarter, Syracuse had the

‘ball for four series of downs and managed only
one ﬁrst down.

Brian Bubnis, _Greg Keller and Jim Flanigan
played their best games to date. The defensehad
been specially arranged to handle Syracuse and
it paid off. Thereyvs/ere six men" on the line for
most of the game with two linebackers lining up
on either side’ of the ends. ‘

Flanigan was holding down the middle with 1
_ Tippy Pohl roving to either side of Flanigan. Tip-

py, accustomed to the secondary, _was actually a
roving linebacker Saturday and he felt like “a
piece of bologna between two slices of bread.”
Defensive coach Bill' Neal cited both Pohl
and Keller. ~“Tippy kept the, pressure up and Keller

gave us a heck of an effort. _ k 4
' Dave Hart also reflected this_defensive opti-

mism. “It was our best defensive game this year.
I’m not unhappy with .the score because the kids
didn’t quite and they were playing against a much
better team than either Army or Navy.”

The only reason the Panthers didn’t win Sat-
urday was because the offensive unit was simply

.outpowered. They ‘gained nine yards rushing the

whole day. But'Hart might have found a quarter-
back in Bob Bazylak, who came in the second half
and completed seven of 14 passes, one for the lone
score to end Frank Hartz.

“That little plugger’s got conﬁdence,” said
Hart. Babylak, a former high school All-American,
will need all the conﬁdence he can muster for
next week he’ll probably start against Notre Dame.

After graduating from high

tered Mitchell Junior College,

tional Junior College Champion-
ship in 1964.

L Then, West Virginia soccer
coach Greg Myers stepped in. He
wooed Ivahnenko and another
Mitchell star, Ron McEachen, . and
sold both on West Virginia.

The result is the Mountaineer’s

7-1 record, that seventh victory
achieved on Saturday at the boot-
ers’ expense. And, it was Ivah-
nenko, their leading scorer, who
supplied the lone goal in the 1-0
victory.

Midway through the ﬁrst per-
iod, he broke through the booters’
defense, dribbled between two
fullbacks, and drilled _a shot past
goalie Lou Cepanec.

2 Girls Drop Into Last Place

As Blood ‘nl’ Guts Moves Up

The inevitable has ﬁnally hap-
pened. _After six straight weeks
of winning records, the girls took
the big plunge into last place.
Miss Nancy Greensfelder claims,
“I just blew my cool.”

Nobody is offering her any sym-
pathy for her 3-11 record. Almost
everybody else is trying to recov-

 er from the rash of upsets that

plagued their own records.

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein pick-
ed all three games that the con-
sensus (11-3) didn’t register. Mi-

ama shocked ﬁfth-ranked South-

ern Cal,-Washington toppled Stan-
ford, and SMU surprised Texas.
Unfortunately for “Flatbush,”
the rest of his picks didn’t come
through as nicely, forcing him to

.__settle for- a 10-4 slate.
,‘ Coach Dave Hart didn’t win his‘

own game but he won 11 others
to get the coaches back into con-
tention. Fred “Blood _‘n’ Guts”
Frank also tabbed 11 winners to
move him into a tie for ﬁrst place
with the players.

Q

by. DAN LICHTENSTEIN

The . intramural s.0ftb_all
season ﬁnally ended last
Thursday with a bang and a
whimper. Meanwhile, dorm and
fraternity B League football be-
gan to produce its winners on the
‘same day. In the dorms, House’
of Lords beat Random House, 12-
0, and in the intrafraternity
games, Delta Iota Delta stopped
Phi‘ Kappa Theta, 19-6; Lambda
Sigma Rho shutout Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, 12-0; and Phi" Gamma
beat Theta Chi on a technicality.
The‘ grad students’ "softball
team _went “bang,” and all Pi
Lambda Phi could do wasewhimp-
per as the former terrors of the
fraternity league dropped the All
Campus championship. Like a hot

potafoby a 15-0 score. ,
Apparently the Pi Lams are
more interested in football now,
for. four of their best softball
players just didn’t show for the
game. Greg Simmons, l\/Iarc
Schwartz, Dick Baumgart and
Chuck Greene, ﬁne fielders and
strong hitters were replaced by

subs. And Shelley Bratman’s hot
pitching must have cooled along
with the weather, as the hPi
Lams generally crumbled under
the grads’ 15 hit attack.
Football provided obviously
more exciting games. Random, in
its ﬁrst game ofﬂthe year, lost in
the ﬁrst quarter on scoring bombs
from House of Lords quarter-
back Bob Peck to Jim Miller. Al-
though Random kept the Lords
scoreless for the last three per-
iods, the losers themselves never
got close to a score all afternoon.

Fine blocking by Lords’ linemen.

Ray Legg, Darrel’ Black 0 and
John‘ Morrison kept the game on
ice for the winners.

. This Tuesday, the DIDs and
the Lasers meet in a clash of un-
beaten powers which could ulti-
matelymean the‘_B League cham-
pionship. The DIDs had not trou-

C ble with the Phi Kaps as quarter- ' "

Pitt News Review

Chekov Mars His Own Play

by LESLIE HART

The Boot, the University of
Pittsburgh Theater’s Oct. 28 pro-
duction, had only one problem:
its author. The play was rife
with Chekov's worst faults repeti-
tive dialogue, two dimensional
characterization and superﬁcial
comic effect. It was not surprising

that none of the novice actors

could drag any character devel-
opment from the frictionless bag
of pudding they had to handle.
Chamber Music was inﬁnitely
better: Eight women in a lunatic
asylum hold a meeting. With
chilling parliamentary precision,
they decide to kill one of their
number. The victim is to be sent
as a threat to the men’s ward,
which they imagine plans to at-
tack them.
I Barbara Lyon’s performance as
the woolly-headed Yiddish wom-
an was letter-perfect. She retain-
ed a dignity which would have
escaped a lesser actress.
Deborah Greenblat, Joyce Dien
er and Janice Richmond were
generally very effective. Witness

the entrance of Miss Diener as

University
Professor

In India

Professor Harold A. Gould,

‘associate professor of anth-

ropology at the University,
is currently doing research
in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh,
India. Professor Gould will

be in India for 15 months on a

- faculty research felowship award-

ed by the American Institute of
Indian Studies.

A veteran of four research
trips to India, Professor Gould
will study the coming Indian
elections at the level of village
politics.

Dr. Gould received his Ph.D.
from Washington University in
St. Louis and has taught at the
University of Kansas. He has pub-
lished numerous articles and pa-
pers and is writing a book on
Indian politics.

Joan of Arc staggering through
the door under the weight of an
immense cross which “came with
the armor.” “And ‘she wonders
why she’s never invited any-
where,” grows Miss Greenblat.

Paula Molnik, a fragile and
nervous creature, degenerated
beautifully as the character Ger-
trude Stein.

Maxine Bruhns, as Susan B.
Anthony, and Jane Gassner, as
Amelia Erhardt, were the strong-
est characters and the focal point

of the lunacy. Miss Gassner was

especially good when she under-
played pathos in favor of strldent
bitchery. Her death scene is tech-

nically one of the most gripping

I moments in Chamber Music.

You pay a certain‘ price for the
initial emphasis on comedy in a
play in which the ﬁnal effect
must be grim. The audience must
be shaken into accepting the
rightness of a swing from laugh-

, ter to horror. I would see an

even steeper ascent into cathar-
sis, a greater savagery in the mo-
ments of the madwomen as they
erased the only rational voice
among them.

This most moving and difficult
moment of the play was a tri-
bute to the directing skill of Cons-
tance Hipwell.
