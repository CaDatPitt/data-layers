Hospitals to pay for services

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

The Partnership for Medical
Renaissance announced plans to
allocate $11 million to aid the

O city of Pittsburgh over the next 10

years.

Comprised of the Pitt's Medical
and Health Care Division, Eye
and Ear Hospital and Presbyteri-
an University Hospital, the Part-
nership’si contribution is designed
to reimburse the city for the free
police, fire, and other municipal
services it receives now.

According to Pitt president
Wesley Posvar, the agreement
was a "mutual understanding”
between the hospitals and the
city authorities. He also ex-
plained that the $250 million ex-
pansion of the Oakland hospitals
and the added city service need-
ed for the project figured into the
decision.

Mayor Richard Caliguiri said,
”The success of the Partnership
for Medical Renaissance is vital
to the immediate and long-term
economic climate of this city. We
are proud of the achievements of
this national resource, our aca-
demic medical center in Oak-
land, and totally support its efforts
to expand its distinguished med-
ical research and health care pro-
grams in Pittsburgh."

Because hospitals have a tax-
exempt status, they have drawn
criticisms for the financial burden
of cost-free city services.

Posvar said the move was a
”fair thing to do” and that ”the
city reaffirms that the hospital and
university are tax—exempt, non-
profit institutions.”

Medical directors believe that
Pitt’s hospitals must be financial-
ly sound as well as being modem
and appealing to the medical
public.

Dr. Thomas Detre, president of
the MHCD said, ”A key element
in becoming the nation's leading
biochemical research center is
recruiting the world's brightest
scientists."

Figures show that the hospitals
are also creating business for the
city as well.

Seventy-eight percent of the pa-
tients of Presbyterian-University
Hospital come from outside Pitts-
burgh. Approximately $150 mil-
lion is generated by patients,
which pays for hospital salaries,
maintenance and modernized
health care equipment.

Capital is additionally gained
within the city by the families that
accompany patients.

In addition, the construction in
the hospitals will create 6,000
jobs over the next five years.

Posvar contends that the
$11,125,()()() is a "voluntary plea
for services. "

Thornburgh stresses education

By Ed Domurat

For The Pitt News

Former governor Dick Thorn-
burgh stressed that a recommit-
ment to excellence in the nation’s
primary, secondary and post-
secondary education systems and
a strengthening of curricula are
necessary to encourage student
achievement and improve the ef-
fectiveness of our teachers.

Thornburgh spoke yesterday af-
ternoon in the David Lawrence
Auditorium. His lecture, entitled
"Educating for Expanding
Horizons in a Shrinking World,"
encompassed issues he believes
should be on this nation's educa-
tion agenda.

"Mediocrity threatens to engulf
our education system," Thorn-
burgh said. "In a study, it was

found that 40 percent of our 17-
year-olds could not write an es-
say and one-third could not solve
a math problem which required
more than a few steps.”

He explained that education
must concentrate on such things
as foreign language skills. ”The
world is shrinking rapidly and the
United States must remain com-
petitive in education. Prepared-
ness in foreign language is now
the watchword in the education
system."

He discussed how the educa-
tion system could be improved
by strengthening class require-
ments and raising the level of
minimum skills a student must
learn in classes. As proof of this,
Thornburgh said that while col-
lege entrance scores decreased in
24 states, they increased in Penn-

sylvania last year as a result of
measures instituted during his ad-
ministration.

Thornburgh cautioned that
”rigor without compassion leads
to sterility," meaning that some
students may not be ready or able
to accept the challenge.

"To require a troubled student
to take another math class is like
raising the hurdle for an athlete
who has not been coached
properly," Thornburgh said.

Thornburgh also stressed that
vocational training classes should
be reviewed constantly to better
match students to the demands of
the job market, explaining that a
student will feel bitterness and
disappointment if schools do not
fill this need.

Business students to
taste foreign culture

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Students at the University of
Pittsburgh's School of Business
will get a taste of foreign culture
on Friday when the school
celebrates the second annual ln—
ternational Day festival.

”The festival is designed to
make students aware of the inter-
national community,” said Carl
Bell, president of the Student Ex-
ecutive Board.

International Day is also a
celebration of the origins of about
15 percent of the student body in
the MBA program who are from
foreign countries, according to
Donna Wood, an associate
professor and director of the MBA
program.

”This is a small way to in-
troduce domestic students to for-
eign cultures,” said Wood.

"The business community is
becoming more international,"
said Bell. He explained that fu-
ture business professionals must
be aware of the way foreign
clientele conduct business. He

also said that the festival will offer
new insight into the vastly differ-
ent ideologies present throughout
the international business com-
munity.

”lt is important that students
realize that different cultures have
different habits,” said Wood.

The festival will offer "a real
variety of cultural experiences,”
she added.

International Day is scheduled
to include foods from various
countries as well as slides, ex-
hibits and folk dancing. Some stu-
dents will also attend wearing
traditional garb.

International Day was or-
ganized by students on the Ex-
ecutive Board and will be run by
volunteer students and some of
their families.

According to Wood, some for-
eign embassies will contribute in-
formational brochures.

The festival will last from noon
to 4:30 p.m. at Mervis Hall and
is open to all students. Tickets
will be sold at the door for $5 per
person.

Contras-Sandinistas hold talks to set truce date

SAPOA, Nicaragua —— The San-
dinista government and Contra
rebels announced proposals
Tuesday for an extended cease-
fire that would include amnesty
and steps toward a lasting peace.

The leftist _government’s
proposal, outlined in a statement
to journalists on the second day
of peace talks at this post on the
Costa Rican border, calls for a
30-day truce with the rebels in-
tended for them to lay down their
arms and ”rejoin Nicaraguan
society.”

It also provides for the release
of a political prisoner for each
rebel accepting amnesty. Deputy
Foreign Minister Victory Hugo
Tinoco told reporters there are
3,300 prisoners the government
considers eligible for release un-
der the program.

The Contra proposal calls for a
45-day truce starting on Good Fri-
day, April 1, in which rebel fight-

ers would move into cease-fire
zones still to be determined.

It said the government should
grant ”total and unconditional
amnesty" as soon as the truce
takes effect, allowing anyone
who left Nicaragua for political
reasons to ”rejoin the political,
economic and social process
without any conditions."

The rebels also want to join a
national dialogue between the
Sandinistas and their internal po-
litical opponents while the cease-
fire lasts. The government also
would allow rebel leaders to par-
ticipate in national reconciliation
talks.

Both proposals call for interna-
tional monitoring of the
cease-fire.

Right-to-lifers win as
abortion bill passes
HARRISBURG — Gov. Robert

P. Casey said Tuesday he will
sign new legislation to restrict
abortions as soon as the legisla-
ture completes paperwork and
sends the bill to him.

said during an impromptu news
conference after the swearing-in
ceremonies for Secretary of
General Services David Jannetta.
”l’ve said prior to this time, and
I'm saying again now that I will
sign it in its present form."
The bill, approved in the
House and Senate by over-
whelming margins, would re-
quire women under 18 to have
the informed consent of one par-
ent or a court order to have an

Mitterrand seeks 2nd

term as president

PARIS —- President Francois
Mitterrand said Tuesday he will
seek a second term, ending
months of speculation on
whether the 71-year-old Socialist
would enter the presidential race.

Appearing on the nationwide
evening newscast of the state-
owned Antenne 2, Mitterrand
was asked if he would run. He
answered with a single word,
”Oui.”

He said he decided to run be-
cause he thinks disunity threatens
”to tear the social fabric" of the
nation.

Greeks play musical
chairs inOlympiad

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

Greeks competed fiercely
against one another in events
ranging from musical chairs to a
tug-of-war last night as part of the
1988 Greek Week Greek Olym-
piad at the Bellefield Annex.

"We're not raising any
money,” said co-chairperson Bet-
sy Southern. ”We're in the mid-
dle of the week, and people are
raising money for the other
events [of Greek Week]. We're
just here to get all of the fraterni-
ties and sororities together, so
they can have a good time and
remember that this is all in good
spirits.”

The Greek Olympiad consisted
of five separate events: musical
chairs, the blindfolded dribbling
relay, the tricycle relay, the obsta-
cle relay and the tug-of-war.

Pitt fraternities and sororities
were divided into six teams of
three fraternities and two sorori-
ties. Teams were designated by
different colors.

There was a total of 48 contes-
tants in the musical chairs event:
four men and four women from
each team.

”Quickness. You gotta be

quick,” said freshman Ron
Wivagg from Pi Kappa Alpha, the
winner of the event for the red

team. ”The beginning was just -

pure luck. It took a lot of strength
in the later rounds.”

”Musica| chairs is the tradition-
al event,” said Tim McLaughin,
the other chairperson of this
event. ”The other events we've
tried to make a little more athlet-
ic. Not too much, but enough to
be fun.”

Six people participated in the
blindfolded dribbling relay, three
men and three women.

’’It was great; I loved [the drib-
bling relay], and I'm going to do
it again next year," said Nora
Kachmar, a sophomore at Kappa
Alpha Theta who was on the win-
ning black team.

Next was the tricycle race.
Again, there were three women
and men on each team. The com-
petitors didn't have to use the pe-
dals but had to remain seated.

’’It brought back old memories
of my childhood,” said Dan john-
son Jr. from the winning blue
team. ’’I just let my feet do the
walking.”

The black team won the obsta-
cle course, and the green team
won the tug of war against the

The tricycle competition was just one of the many strange events Pitt greeks had to
perform last night in the Greek Olympiad.

white team.

The night was described as
”mass chaos.”

’’I didn't expect [the Olympiad]
to be this intense,” said Wivagg.

’’It was overwhelming,” said
Kachmar. ”Everyone is going
crazy."

feels improvements can be made
in post-secondary education:

0 First, basic research in non-
defense project areas must be ex-
panded to allow more students to
participate.

0 Secondly, there must be im-
proved technology transfer from
research to the workplace so that
students will have a better under-
standing of what they will need
to learn to enter the job market.

0 Finally, there must be in-
creases in student grants and
loans.

In conclusion, Thornburgh said
that ”education is one of the most
pressing domestic problems of
this country. The next president
must focus the nation's attention
on the education system. It is per-
tinent to America's continued
success in the world. We must
enlarge our horizons and expand
our vision. We must provide edu-
cation with hope for tomorrow.”

the U.S.S.R. satisfying

ERIE, Pa. (AP) A former Penn-
sylvania man who with his wife
received political asylum in the
Soviet Union says life there suits
him just fine.

”We have found this country to
be free, with all freedoms you
find in America. You may also at-
tend the church of your choice.
People also speak freely," Theo-
dore Branch said in a letter from
Moscow to George Sharrer of
Erie, a bus driver who befriend-
ed Branch when he was down on
his luck.

Branch, 43, and his wife,
Cheryle Hoffman Branch, 40, left
the United States with a tour
group in November. On Jan. 19,
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokes-
man Gennady l. Gerasimov an-
nounced that the Branches had
been granted political asylum
and would be given jobs and an
apartment.

’’In the USSR there is no unem-
ployment and no homeless peo-
ple. Also, medical care is free.
This is also true in most cases for

visitors. Each employee receives
one month's paid vacation each
year,” Branch wrote in a letter

Sharrer said he received
Saturday.

”We now live in Moscow,
U.S.S.R.,” Branch said. ”We

have lived here since Nov. 15,
1987, and the weather seems to
be like Erie's.”

The couple both lost jobs when
a Florida radio station went off
the air in 1986, and although
they won back pay of $6,500 in
court, they were unable to
collect. V

Sharrer, an Erie Metropolitan
Transit Authority driver for ll
years, said he talked with Branch
when the man rode home from
his job as a janitor at an Erie
department store.

”l never heard anything from
him about ideology,” he told the
Erie Daily Times. ”He got disgust-
ed with not being able to find a
job. He kept saying he couldn't
make ends meet with a
minimum—wage job.”

Contraception a must to prevent unwanted pregnancies

Q: My boyfriend just won ’t use
condoms. I love him very much,
and I don't even want to think
about not having sex with him.
What can I do?

A: Don't have sex with him un-
less there is contraception. No
matter how much you love him,
don't. I will modify that by say-
ing don't have sexual intercourse,
but share other forms of sexual

Q gratification with him that will

never cause you to have an un-
welcome pregnancy. I don't
know why you are not using
some form of contraception your-
self, but until you do, do not have
full intercourse.

I realize that it is very, very hard
not to give in on this to a man
you love, but he does not love
you enough to respect your fears
and your wishes. Love in this
relationship is a one—way street.
Think about that, even if you

\ don't want to.

Q: Can we give children posi-
tive feelings about sex while
warning them about the danger
of AIDS?

A: Absolutely, but we have to

cation primarily, and teaching
about AIDS as a certain part of
sex education. The big message
can't be that AIDS will get you
like the bogeyman. We have to
teach something more positive.

Across the country we now
have AIDS education with a small
component of sex education.
That will not be helpful to posi-
tive feelings about sex in the de-
veloping person. That will
promote what has been so harm-
ful in the past —— fear and guilt
about those sexual urgings that
every single healthy person has
rising inside him or her as part of
being alive.

The Surgeon General is abso-
lutely right to inform the public
of the facts about how AIDS is
transmitted, and I join every
citizen in thanking him. It is his
job to be responsible for our
health and courageous in getting
the truth to people.

But programs for informing
children and youths about sex
cannot be all warning and trying
to instill fear, or the effect of the
warning will be weakened.

621-6017

if all the education they get is
threats of danger. They have to be
given a sense of values about sex
as a shared pleasure with a life
partner, of sex as a joy that is
worth protecting from harm.

 
DR. RUTH

WESTHEIMER

Q: What qualifies a woman as
a nymphomaniac? I ’m not asking
out of idle curiosity — my girl-
friend has never, ever said no to
me in over two years. Would you
call her a case ofnymphomania?

A: Not me. I never called any
woman that, because the word is
meaningless to me. You may like
to think of her that way — it
makes you feel proud and lucky,
like the man whose girl is pretty,
good-natured, fun, never makes
him jealous and also owns a golf

course. If it gives you pleasure to
think how much your girlfriend
likes sex, and how you seem to
have that wonderful girlfriend all
to yourself, that may be the nicest
use of the word nymphomaniac
I ever heard.

All too often, a man calls a
woman that because she likes a
lot more sex than he does, or
wants more out of the sex they
share. One man calls a woman a
nympho because she wants sex
several times a night, another be-
cause she would like sex twice a
week, another because sex every
single month seems outrageous
to him. Women have been called
nymphos because they don't
have orgasms and want to have
them. There is almost nothing but
unfairness in the use of that un-
helpful word.

So your girlfriend has never
had a headache! Let the aspirin

makers worry about that. Does
she ever start a sexual encounter,
or is that always your job? I'm not
trying to make trouble. Only
sometimes men say a woman is
a nympho because she is sexual-
ly forward. Yours, it seems, just
has a way of always saying yes.
If that bothers you, you could try
not asking her — see if she just
calmly does her crossword puz-
zle instead. Would you like that?

And I have this to say -— don't
start asking her more and more
often in order to find out if she
will ever say no! Don't push your
luck. Don't spoil your good for-
tune by turning it into grinding

research! So far as I can see, you ~

are a lucky guy, the only cloud
being that sometime she will say
no and then you have to under-
stand, for the first time’ that
everybody has the right to say no
without the sky falling.

Hospitals should do
something to help

The city of Pittsburgh and the university recently came to an
agreement on a plan for the university medical complex to pay
slightly more than $11 million over the next ten years to offset
the cost of city services.

In a joint announcement, President Posvar and Mayor Richard
Caliguiri expressed pleasure in the arrangement. The reason-
ing of the university seems to be that since the medical com-
plexes uses city services, such as police, fire and trash collection,
it should feel some responsibility to help bear the cost of those
services. In light of the proposed $250 million expansion of
the complex, and the increased demand on city services cer-
tain to be created by it, we feel that the university has acted
responsibly.

If Pitt wishes to establish itself further as a major and viable

 part of lPittisbur1lglh',_ and‘wi,she'slto'use‘the public facilities of the

city to secure a position for itself as a major medical center,
nothing less would be reasonable. As for the other city hospi-
tals, each should examine its financial position, and if a simi-
lar plan is possible, steps should be taken toward
implementation.

It's time for General

Noriega to be gone

Manuel Noreiga, general and leader of the Panamanian mili-
tary, has agreed to step down, providing that all of his demands
are met.

On the surface, the demands he has made seem reasonable
enough. He wants to have a say in the government that will
assume control when he leaves and he wants to have meet-
ings with the opposition leaders.

However, there is something insidious about Noriega's gambit
to get out of office with his head still firmly attached to his neck.
He is attempting to bargain from the same position as an un-
popular but legitimate government. There are a number of ad-
jectives that could be used to describe the Noriega fiasco,
including oppressive, violent, petty and corrupt. Legitimate be-
comes laughable when applied to a man who is facing indict-
ments in Florida on numerous counts of drug smuggling and
influence peddling.

So far, the United States has cut off the flow of American dol-
lars, the local currency, to Panama. As a result, there are
widespread and growing protests by Panamanian workers and
shopkeepers who have not been paid. In retaliation, Noriega
and his band of rutting goons have declared a ”state of urgen-
cy,” which provides for the clandestine arrest and detaining
of individuals suspected of ”anti—state” activities.

Without an influx of dollars, and with the virtual halt of most
domestic services, the general will soon be forced from office
by a people for whom he can no longer guarantee wages.
Money talks, as we have been told. Lack of money screams.
Noriega, finally, has become a victim of the poverty he has im-
posed during his brutal reign.

In a nutshell 

I assert that the cosmic ‘religious. experience is the
strongest and noblest driving force behind scientific

research. _ .

A balancing act in business

I have had the cartoon in my
desk for months now. A lone
businesswoman is standing be-
fore a table full of suited men.
One of the men asks her this
question: ”If you have a baby,
will you like it better than us?”

It is a wonderful moment, com-
mically inappropriate, ripe with
possibilities. In real life, after all,
the word ”like," or surely the
word ”love,” is kept out of the
boardroom. In real life, no boss
or panel of partners would air
their anxiety about the alienation
of a co-worker's affection.

Indeed, we are not expected to
feel as strongly about our col-
leagues or even our jobs as we do
about our families. In all the talk
about work and family conflicts,
we couch our concerns in much
more objective terms. We talk
about political struggles over
hours and obligations. We talk
about parental guilt and work-
place inflexibility, about stress
and stretch, time and tension.

But maybe in all this, we have
missed something the cartoonist
saw. A hidden component to the
work/family dilemma. A compo-
nent called jealousy.

One woman who chuckled at
the printed image admitted that
she often felt like the central
character in a menage a trois, a
love triangle. Her double life of
working mother remained as
difficult to arrange as that of a
married woman finding time in
her Filofax for an affair.

Leafing back to six years ago,
when her baby was born, she
remembers how her boss put her
through a series of small tests. At
the time, she thought that he was
testing her commitment to work.
Now she wonders if he was test-
ing her commitment to him.
Once she had her baby, did she
like the baby more?

I suppose that sibling rivalry is
a better model for this sort of
jealousy. A friend said she never
understood her manager's be-
havior until she had two children
of her own. Her eldest daughter
acted up like clockwork
whenever she fed the newborn.
Her department head just as regu-
Iarly arrived with problems as she
headed out to the babysitter.

The same man who had been

  

 

EELEN
GOODMAN

genial when she needed time off
for study or medical care was visi-
bly disapproving when she need-
ed time off for motherhood. He
kept track of the claims of his
small rivals with the arithmetic
precision and the suspicion of an
elder child. He didn't want to
share her attention with the
(other) children.

We have ignored the psycho-
logical model of the workforce
for so long that it's easy to exag-
gerate it here. Most bosses, male
and female, have a company
goal, a production quota, work to
be done. That is their priority.
Whatever distracts workers
makes the company less (in the
word of the hour) competitive.
But even that word resonates in
our personal lives.

Have you seen the television
ad that shows a swimmer think-
ing of work as she does her laps?
She's an employer's fantasy of a
single-minded employee whose

brain is always on the job even
while her body is submerged.
Do you remember that mo-
ment in the movie Kramer vs.
Kramer, when Dustin Hoffman
was describing the joys of father-
hood to his boss and his boss
fired him? In Baby Boom, Diane
Keaton’s superior replayed that
scene when Keaton fell in love
with the baby. She lost her place

because she had ”gone soft.” Q,

Are these strictly business de-
cisions? Are those in charge care-
fully calculating the cost of chaos
and confusion? Or is there a
jealous soul wondering: ”What
about me? Don't I come first
anymore?"

We think of the two parts of our
lives separately. We subdivide
them neatly into the personal and
the professional. We think of the
conﬂict between family and work
as one between people and tasks,
relationships and obligations.

But it isn't really like that. Most
of us have two personal lives: one
at home and one at the office. We
have two sets of relationships.
There are many employers, of

course, who feel comfortable .

with these shared loyalties and try ”

to build bridges over the gaps.
But it isn't only bosses in car-

toons who worry that a working

mother will neglect them. Under
many a proper business suit there
is a little green-eyed monster who
sometimes sees families as not-
quite-sibling rivalries.

Making a fashion statement

Ever wonder why we dress the
way we do? Just why do we
adorn ourselves so?

Go two days without shaving
(guys only, please), wear yester-
day's socks and sweatpants, and
what's left of your running shoes.
Go ahead. You'd only be dressed
conservatively in these parts.

I've seen some strange folks
lately. Strange to me, though.
They're having a good time,
showing off matching tatooed
leather and partially shaved
heads. What is the point that
someone with multiple rattails is
trying to make? If they're not sure
what fashion or social statement

‘they're trying to make, why do I

have to watch them attempt to
become throwbacks to sealife?

Skateboarders come to mind. I
was watching one kid with a
death wish defy gravity and good
taste as he propelled his board
and self from a cement bench to
the top of a garbage can. Can one
be overdressed for such an event?
Shredded jeans and fingerless
gloves for him are as chic as a
case of Perrier languishing in a
fridge. When you're attempting
to trash yourself, why wear a
necktie, or even a shirt? Crash
helmet is optional.

One subject that pops up now
and then is why some folks dress
to kill. This is Pittsburgh, not New

Q York. Not too many people

spend more than a couple

 

BRO“! N

hundred on an outfit in these
parts, but if someone does, is it
to attract the opposite sex or to
impress folks that you can afford
to squander so much on a gold
lame dress? Where would you
wear that in Oakland without get-
ting mugged, anyway?

Most times, I just schlepp
around in permawrinkle cotton
clothes. Comfortable, laid back
— something that reflects my
lifestyle. No, I don't have wrin-
kles. I’m just too lazy to iron
clothes. Other days, it's sweat-
suits or camouflage. So many
people wear cammies; one more
tossed salad walking around cam-
pus doesn't stand out.

Perhaps an utter disregard for
what someone else thinks about
one's attire is expressive. This,
then, explains a person with a

foot—tall mohawk, and I did see an
impressive tie-dyed mohawk the
other day. It must be a bummer
for that dude when it rains.

The different cultures here
show off some different fashions.
Chinese exchange students, for
example, seem to come issued
with matching haircuts and blue
plastic insulated coats, but is this
just as natural as an American in
bluejeans? Who cares?

Hemlines are rising again,
proof that there is a God. I saw
a skirt last weekend that could
have been mistaken for a belt. Af-
ter a winter of slacks, it's so nice
to see a few hundred pairs of legs
in the sunshine. Am I a voyeur for
thinking that, or am I only
human?

I did miss the last Daytona trip
of cheap beer and sun, but the
photos are shocking. Fashion
takes on new definitions during
spring break, especially if a $50
bill is riding on the issue. Frank
Zappa was right.

While still on the spring break
subject, ever notice the shrinking
amount of material put into
swimsuits? This has been going
on for some time, and at this
pace, swimsuits should be
replaced by suntans within two
or three years. Are we ready for
this? Am I ready for this, and
should I book reservations now?

No fashion is safe from abuse
and a|l's fair under the sun.

Looking back on the 19805

At the beginning of this year,
Newsweek magazine ran a cover
story stating, "The '80s Are
Over.”

”Pshaw!," I spat as I spied the
foul words. "Well written but
wrong," was the little credence
I gave to the prematurely pub-
lished paradigm of posterity. The
decade of our youth simply can-
not and, more importantly, must
not be in its denouement — there
are still far too many Madonna
songs yet unsung!

0 Alas, however, as the days go-

0‘

ing by are soon becoming days
gone bye, the ghastly prophecy of
Newsweek's harbinger of the ar-
thritic attitude is becoming more
apparent. The fun—filled times of
body-making and aerobicising
with Jake and Jane have given
way to a new national sport,
couch potato-ing. Sushi is shot,
pate is passe, and pasta is, once
again, simply spaghetti.

But what is possibly the most
revealing indicator of it all is the
fact that we are in the last days,
for better or worse, of "the CEO
ofthe '80s," Ronald Reagan. For
the man who held one of the
most popular sways on the
American public in history and
whose name alone embodied the
body politic during the decade,
it now truly is, like it or not, bed-
time for Bonzo. And the criti-
cisms that the landscape of his
"shining city on a hill" should be
bordered with "here, there be
dragons" are for the first time be-
ing given attention.

But what does this mean to me
and you? Well, everybody (fellow
seniors especially), those two lit-

 

   

CHRISTOPHER
SEPESY

tle words we gave nary a thought
to as we were listening to the
sound made when doves cried
four years ago are headed our
way at full speed. If you listen
closely enough, you'll be able to
hear all of your defenseless
memories crying out as they get
trampled. "Get out of the way 
run away, run away  it's REAL
LIFE comin’ to get your ass."
You must forgive me for vent-
ing my frustrations to you. But it's
a leveling thought to have that as
you can remember yourself leav-
ing Purple Rain and wanting
”Let's Go Crazy" as the new na-
tional anthem, this year's fresh-
man class was not yet even in
high school. That Live Aid, "Our
Woodstock," according to Joan
Baez, which you either attended
or watched via satellite, was-al-
ready three years ago. That most
people nowadays‘ don't even
know, let alone remember there
was a White Tower and Fotohut
where Rax is now, and that the

”O" was not even half its present
size, and sans the Las Vegas
throwback sign.

Our movies and music, the
keystones by which we will be
remembered, are even showing
a menopausal attitude. The fun
times and fast schemes of Porky's
and Risky Business have given
way to the Casanova meets Nor-
man Bates twist of Fatal Attrac-
tion (read: there is a very thin
dividing line between sex and
death) and Wall Street (you mean
Sir Ivan of Boesky wasn't looking
out for Mom, the flag and apple
pie?). Nowadays, we're taking a
closer look at the man in the mir-
ror rather than worrying about
how sharply he's dressed, and the
"Material Girl" —— belted out by
the pop tart to end all breakfast
foods, Madonna —— is now begin-
ning to wonder what she has
done to deserve this.

Now, I can hear all the adults
out there reading this, saying,
"Ha, just wait, kid.” I can respect
this, but as I'm weeping into my
Michelob, yearning for those
"Glory Days" once again, I'll at
least have one consoling thought.

What the hell, it was fun.

Living and dying
on the roll of dice

"I pledge allegiance to
the flag ..." -— but I don't
know if I could die for it.

Being drafted was never
much of concern for me.
For most students, the idea
of fighting a war is an out-
dated thought.

Why shouldn't it be? The
Vietnam war served as a
painful lesson for the Unit-
ed States and remains a
controversial issue.

Considering the impact
of Vietnam and the ublic’s
sensitivity to such qllestion- 
able warfare, what are the y 
chances of it ever happening again? Well, nothing's impossible.

The recent Nicaragua-Honduras confrontation opens up many
hypothetical questions for today's students. Presently, Nicaragua
has returned to its borders and has announced it will undergo
peace negotiations with the Contras. However, for the sake of
this column, what would happen if it didn't?

Let's be so bold to suppose that Nicaragua launched a full-
scale invasion into Honduras with the claim that it was only
protecting its borders from Contra camps existing within Hon-
duras. What do we do now?

The next likely step is for the United States to flex a bigger
muscle than the 82nd Airborne. So Ron calls in his military ad-
visors, breaks out some coffee and doughnuts and plans some
strategy. If we fast-foward the political rhetoric, we'll soon see
more troops being sent to Honduras and perhaps draft notices
in our mailboxes.

Of course, this is a general and unlikely scenario, but it could
happen. And if it did, how would Americans react?

Over the past decade, the American public’s attitude has
grown into a conservative one.

Five years ago, the Reagan administration seemed invu|ner-
able in the public eye. In 1983, Reagan sent troops to Grenada
to prevent a Marxist government take-over. The move was dar-
ing, perfectly executed and successful. The media praised him
to all heights, and he was soon on his way to being established
as a strong leader and effective president.

Recently, with the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan lost some
points with the press and the public who now may only remem-
ber him as a puppet president.

However, Ronny still has a few moves in him, and if war did
break out and he called for a draft, there's not a whole hell of
a lot anyone can do about it.

The fanaticism of the'60s is at a low level at most universi-
ties. Students, especially at Pitt, seem to be more motivated by
dollar signs than by peace and harmony. If a draft went into
effect, would public opposition be strong enough to defeat it?

Even though Reagan's honesty and abilities are presently
doubted, the public apparently has no problem with the poli-
cies of his administration. Why else would George Bush, a
strong advocate of Reagan, be so popular?

If anyone has ever played the game Risk, they can understand
the thinking of the Reagan administration. In the game, players
claim territory around the world and do battle with other play-
ers, using dice, in an effort to conquer as many countries as
possible. The winner is the one who conquers the world.

Ideology states that communism is geared to claiming as much
territory as the world can provide. And no matter how nice a
guy Gorbachev is, the Reagan administration goes by Russian
history.

I've played Risk a few times and the game is addicting. One
night, a few buddies and I went through the whole night and
a case of beer until somebody finally won the damn thing. The
game is exhausting, but there's nothing like the feeling of
conquest.

The desire for power is a part of human nature, regardless

  

Me

of ideology. The United States enjoys a piece of the world just i

like the Soviets and each has its own game strategy for survival.

Luckily, in the real world we can depend on human lives,
rather than dice, to establish our territories. If a country, for one
reason or another, comes too close to our boundaries, we can

shoot them rather than just challenge them to a beer-chugging V

COFIIGSI.

Some -say we must fight communism before it threatens to
invade our own country. However, until another Hitler rises
to power, I would be reluctant to kill and be killed for the sake
of the big picture.

Examining the housing lottery

Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer ‘

Before Pitt instituted the lottery
system for university housing,
such methods as ”first-come—first-
serve” and stuffing mailboxes
with applications were used.

Leslie Masciola, administrative
assistant of the Housing Office
said, ”The system of stuffing mail-
boxes did not work because it
was not fair as to where they start-
ed and stopped. The first—come-
first-serve system did not work
because you start to get what hap-
pens for concert tickets with the
system.”

Masciola added, ”There are not
enough rooms for all the appli-
cants, so the lottery seems the
fairest way.”

There are a total of 4,200
places in the residence halls with
1,850 being reserved for incom-
ing freshmen. The remaining
2,350 go to returning students
and are divided with respect for
the male-female ratio.

Masciola said that ”everything
has room for improvement, but I

think it does work well.”
Students who draw a number

in the lottery that is too high to
receive housing can put them-
selves on a waiting list. The list
follows the same numerical se-
quence for room selection as the
lottery.

’’It is obvious that there is not
enough housing, but there is no
where else to build,” said
Masciola.

Some students agree. Kelly
Nicholson, who picked a good
lottery number, said, ’’It is a must
because there is too little housing
for too many students.”

Some students have com-
plained about the lottery process.
”The gripes are from people with
high numbers. We usually get to
those people, but it is the wait
that bothers them,” said
Masciola.

’’I picked a bad number my
sophomore year and got housing
in July. I was worried and disgust-
ed that I had to wait that long to
see if l would get in. l was in lim-
bo,” said senior Bob Hartman.

Dan Lewis, who picked a bad
number, said, ’’I don't feel that it
is very fair. It does not take the in-
dividual student into account -

such as who can commute — and
merit."

An exception to this is Pitt
junior Len Culley. Culley, who
drew a good number, said, ”The
lottery system stinks. Every year
you are in fear of losing your
housing. Also, most of my friends
got bad numbers, so it makes
room selection harder.”

Culley added, ”There should
be an advantage or priority for
students who live a greater dis-
tance away because finding other
housing could leave them
stranded.”

The university does offer alter-
natives for those students who are
unable to get housing. The Off-
Campus Housing Office, in the
William Pitt Union, gives listings
of other available places to live
in the area.

Another alternative is given for

people with a processed agree- 1

ment for a waiting list. Masciola
said, ’’If we realize we cannot get
to them, we give them a refer-
ence to live in the Carlow Col-
lege dorms for one term, and they
will get priority here for the
winter."

Kite flies girl in

bizarre plane mishap

University Hospital snagged
the kite and jerked her off the
ground.

She flew about 200 feet,

‘about 10 feet off the ground,
until she let go to avoid hitting
a tree.

Pilot Jake Uranga, of Reno,
Nev., and his passenger also
were uninjured and the plane?‘
landed safely at Palo Alto air-
port nearby.

The plane suffered $10,000
in damage, and the park has
banned kite flying until an in-
vestigation is complete.

”She said it was just a big
jerk that lifted her into the air,”
said DeAndra’s mother, Deb-
by. ’’It carried her right over
my husband's head.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.
(AP) — One moment, DeAn—
dra Anrig was peacefully flying
her kite. The next, she too was
soaring through the air, courte-
sy of a passing plane which
snagged the kite string.

”l’m very sore — and I was
very scared,” said the 8-year-
old Dublin, Calif., youngster
after spending Monday at
home on an air mattress, sur-
rounded by ice packs. ’’I want
to go kite flying again, but
where there are no airplanes."

On Sunday, DeAndra and
her father, Brad, were flying
the kite at Shoreline Park, us-
ing strong 200—pound test line.

THE PlTT NEWS

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

Rod Brookin, a sophomore for-
ward at Pitt, called a press con-
ference in Harrisburg yesterday,
according to WPH 0; TV in Har-
risburg. .

Brookin, who missed Pitt's last
23 games and 26 overall because
of academic problems, scheduled

a press conference at noon, but‘

decided to cancel it, WPH — TV
reported.

Brookin gave no reason for the
press conference.

Pitt assistant coach John

Calipari said he was not aware
that Brookin had called the press
conference. Calipari said he ex-
pected to see Brookin in Pitts-
burgh yesterday.

’’I talked to him yesterday,”
Calipari said. ”He was supposed
to see me today [Tuesday], and
he hasn't been here.”

Rumor has it that Brookin may
be planning to transfer from Pitt
to another school. The press con-
ference was supposedly to an-
nounce his departure from or
reaffirmation with the Pitt
program.

The 6-foot-5 Brookin came to

Tournament loss may
be more costly then
originally expected

OK, so Pitt lost its biggest
basketball game of the season.
But isn't everyone taking the loss
a little too hard? And isn't Paul
Evans receiving more abuse than
he deserves?

l’l| readily admit Evans failed to
make some coaching moves in
the last few minutes of the Van-
derbilt game that I thought would
have assured a Pitt victory.

But no one ever said the guy is
perfect.

JOI-IN
ENRIGHT

Evans’ failure to get a timeout
after Charles Smith's two free
throws put Pitt up 69-66 with :04
left seemed to be the most
flagrant mistake he made.

Heck, even Roy Chipman,
Pitt's former coach, said on a ra-
dio talk show that he would have
called time.

Evans’ second mistake, and the
one that seems to be getting the
most ink, was his failure to give
the players clear instructions on
whether to foul. Barry Goheen,
uncontested, then nailed the
three-point jumper that sent the
game into overtime.

Senior team captain Charles
Smith criticized Evans, saying that
”...anybody who knows basket-
ball knows where the fault lies.”

Smith hasn't spoken alone on
that point. Teammates De-
metreus Gore, Sean Miller, Jason
Matthews, Darelle Porter and Jer-
ome Lane agree that Porter was
never given clear instructions to
foul, which seemed to be the

most appropriate course of
action.

I'm not trying to shift the
blame, but let's look at this con-
troversial loss from a new per-
spective.

Smith says the coaches
screwed up. OK, most people
would agree on that. Smith, in es-
sence, is saying Pitt’s decision to
foul should be dictated by the
coaching staff. Otherwise, the
players would do no such thing.

What I want to know is: since
when do Pitt players, including
Smith, hold true to every instruc-
tion Evans shouts at them?

Smith took a three-point shot
with eight minutes left in the
game, and I’m sure Evans didn't
want him to do that. With Van-
derbilt center Will Perdue out of
the game with five fouls, Smith
took a 15-foot jumper at the be-
ginning of overtime instead of
working the ball inside. I’m sure
that's not what Evans wanted him
to do either.

Smith missed both shots. I'm
not trying to pin the blame on
Smith, but if he acts on his own
instincts with jumpshots, then
why doesn't he do the same with
four seconds left and the season
on the line?

Smith, as team captain, should
have fouled Coheen, since he felt
it was the right thing to do. He
was close enough to him. Smith
almost had a hand in Coheen’s
face when he released his ’Hail
Mary’ shot.

Better yet, Smith should have
called timeout to clarify the
coaches’ instructions after he
made his second foul shot.

But he chose not to do so be-

Please see Pitt, page 13

 

Pitt two seasons ago from
Steelton—Highspire High School.
He quickly proved himself one of
Pitt's main offensive threats, aver-
aging 10.2 points and 4.0 re-
bounds per game. Brookin was
selected to the Big East All-
Freshman Team.

He separated his shoulder pri-
or to the 1987-88 season and
missed the first three games.

Brookin did not return until
Dec. 12, when he scored 12
points in the Panthers’ 70-64 win
over West Virginia.

In five games, he averaged 12.6
points and 4.8 rebounds off the

bench.

Brookin was declared academ-
ically ineligible for the winter
semester and left the university.
He needs 11 credit hours be-
tween now and the fall semester
to become eligible for the
1988-89 season.

Brookin was the second Pitt
player to become academically
ineligible this season. Starting
point guard Mike Coodson did
not suit up once for the Panthers
in 1987-88 and announced in
January that he was transferring to
Fordham.

Stewart, Sheerer win awards at banquet

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Two Lady Panthers received
awards last night at the Third An-
nual Celebration of Women in
Sports hosted by the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce.

Sally Sheerer was given the
Team Sports in Basketball Award
while Lisa Stewart walked away
with two awards —- the Team
Sports Award in Volleyball as

well as the NCAA Division-1
Player of the year award.

Sheerer, who arrived at Pitt
from Fox Chapel High School,
has been a strong contributor to
the roundball squad for the last
four years. This year she was se-
cond on the Lady Panthers in
scoring (13.0) and rebounding
(6.3). Last year she led Pitt in both
categories, averaging 14.3 points
a game while hauling down 8.3
rebounds a game.

In addition to her statistical ac-
complishments, Sheerer was cap-
tain of this year's Lady Panthers.
As the only senior on the Pitt
team, Sheerer showed amazing
durability in starting every game.
Additionally, she was the only
Lady Panther to play all 40
minutes in a game this season.

Consistent with her being the
only senior on the team, Sheerer
was the player her teammates
looked to when they needed

leadership in a tight ballgame.
This year against Penn State,
she came close to leading Pitt to
an upset victory over arch—rival
Penn State. She hit a three point
shot with ten seconds to go to put
the Lady Panthers up by one. Un-
fortunately, the Lady Lions scored
in the final seconds for the win.
However, the clutch performance
was indicative of her season.
Sheerer played a crucial role in
the Lady Panthers advancing be-

yond their opening round game
in the Big East Tournament this
year for the first time since her
freshman season.

Stewart came to the Lady Pan-
thers from the University of Ten-
nessee at the conclusion of her
freshman season. She had been
a volleyball standout at Farrell
High School before becoming a
Volunteer.

Pitt volleyball stalwart Noreen
Coughlin has been nominated by
the university for Female Scholar-
Athlete of the Year in the Big East.
The award is annually given to
the Big East female athlete who
best combines superior academ-
ic performance with athletic ex-
ceﬂence.

Winning the award is worth
$3,000 to be put toward gradu-
ate education by the recipient.

Coughlin has shown that the
concept of the student athlete is
a realistic one if the student ath-

V""+-;?‘-**

.cte IS willing to pay the price.
While performing at a high level
for the Lady Panthers on the
volleyball court, she has main-
tained a 3.42 QPA in the College
of General Studies business

program.

For the last six terms, she has
been on the dean's list as well as
on the athletic director's honor
roll. She was named to the Big
East Academic All-Star Team for
the last two seasons. This past
season she was named to the
Northeast Regional Academic
All-Star team.

Coughlin has been just as ac-
tive away from the classroom and
the court. During the school year,
she has been active in the Fellow-
ship of Christian Athletes as well
as Athletes in Action. For the last
three years she has been a coun-
selor for Hand-in-Hand.

During the summer, Coughlin
has worked at an intermediate
care facility for the mentally
handicapped while finding time
to work as a counselor at North-
east Volleyball Camps.

At one time it appeared highly
unlikely that Coughlin would
ever take the court for the Lady
Panthers. Upon graduation from
Shoreham-Wading River High
School on Long island, Coughlin
decided to attend the Air Force
Academy. At the conclusion of
her freshman year, she decided
the Air Force was not for her. She
decided to transfer to Pitt, where
both the business program and
the volleyball team were of high
caliber.

With Coughlin playing a key
role, the Lady Panthers have ad-
vanced to the NCAA tournament
the last two seasons. Comment-
ing on his standout middle block-
er, Pitt coach Shelton Collier had
this to say: ”Noreen is a real cog-
nitive player. She is always trying
to figure out what the opposition
is trying to do and how best to
stop it. She is very determined.
Although she is not all that gifted
athletically, she has made up for
it with determination.”

Determination is something
that Coughlin has had in large

supply — she has battled back
from a dislocated right knee three
times in her collegiate career.

She played a large role this past
season as the Lady Panthers went
37-6. She was third on the team
with 303 kills. Turning up the lev-
el of her play even higher,
Coughlin led the Big East post-
season tournament with 67 kills.

Coughlin has earned the
respect of her teammates both on
and off the court. Team captain
Louise O’Shaughnessy thought
that Coughlin was underrated as
a player, and admired her aca-
demic record as well. ’’I think
Noreen was the best middle
blocker in the Big East. I think her
being up for this award is great.
It is really hard to keep up with
the academics when you spend
as much time as Noreen does be-
ing mentally prepared to play, ”
said O’Shaughnessy.

For Coughlin, the nomination
for the award is a shot in the arm.
She has often been left off of all-
tournament teams she deserved
to make, losing out to more pub-

honored to be nominated by the
University of Pittsburgh. Having
not been recognized for purely
athletic accomplishments and not
possessing a 3.95 QPA to make

‘Academic All-American, it is

gratifying to be considered for
this award,” said Coughlin.

Concerning her academic ac-
complishments, she commented,
”You can either do well in the
classroom, mediocre or poorly. A
non-revenue athlete does not
have the same lofty goals for a
professional sports career.

’’I think too many people have
the idea that all athletes are dumb

attitudes,” she said.

Steelers
cut off
talks with
Robinson

(AP) -— The Pittsburgh Steelers
have decided to pass on Tony
Robinson, the former Tennessee
quarterback who displayed great
potential before a knee injury and
a jail term for a cocaine con-
viction.

”We no longer have an in-
terest,” Steelers Business
Manager Joe Gordon said. ”We
decided to go in a different direc-
tion — no particular reason.”

Cordon declined to elaborate
Monday.

Earlier, scouts said Robinson
had the physical tools but ques-
tioned his commitment to work-
ing and learning a professional
offense.

Robinson's agent, Neal
Geisinger, said he didn't think his
client fit into the Steelers’
”scheme of things.”

He told the Knoxville News-
Sentinel he didn't think the Na-
tional Football League was ignor-
ing Robinson because of his
cocaine conviction while he was
a senior at Tennessee and a jail
term that recently ended.

’’If i knew, I would say,”
Geisinger said. ’’I'm sure there
are many teams who won't deal
with us because of that. No-
body’s going to come out and say
that.”

Geisinger said he will pursue
opportunities for Robinson in the
Canadian and Arena football

leagues.

The Steelers have indicated in-

terest in trading for a veteran ‘

quarterback and Dallas Cowboys
halfback Tony Dorsett.

Gordon said team officials had
"a lot of conversation" about
trades at last week's NFL meeting
in Phoenix, Ariz., but he ”can't
say we're any closer to a deal."

O’Loughlin overcomes injury
firmly on his feet

and lands

By Sharon Haney

Staff Writer

Sometimes athletes have all
sorts of obstacles to overcome.
Such is the case of freshman gym-
nast Chris O’Loughlin, from West
Chester, Pa.

When he was a junior at West
Chester East High School, he frac-
tured both of his feet; doctors told
him that he would never do gym-
nastics again.

”Doctors even told me that I
wouldn't walk right, but I
wouldn't accept that,” O’Lough-
lin said.

He was determined to prove
the doctors wrong.

After spending three months in
a wheelchair, O’Loughlin fought
hard and managed to get back in
shape in time to be recruited by
Pitt.

O’Loughlin became interested
in gymnastics when he was 10.
He was inspired by watching his
older brother, Joe, who now
coaches. But O’Loughlin says his
biggest influence came from his
coach, John Pancott.

O’Loughlin says his favorite
event is the floor exerise because
he likes to tumble. The easiest

event for him is the vault. He
said, ”The vault I could do in my
sleep.” He thinks the hardest
event is the pommel horse. ”It
takes a lot of strength. It's mostly
mental.”

The Pennsylvania state cham-
pion last year, O’Loughlin says
his greatest thrills in gymnastics
came this year. One thrill was
receiving a 9.0 on the vault dur-
ing the Great Lakes Champion-
ships, and the other was scoring
his highest al|—around total, a
47.6, against Penn State in the fi-
nal meet of the year. -

About this season, O’Loughli
said, ’’It had it's ups and downs,
but the team did really well this
year. It was a team effort. Every-
body chipped in.”

O’Loughlin credits some of his
fellow teammates for motivating
him, especially the assistant
coach Marty Comini and the two
team captains, Steve Powanda
and Danny Tarosky.

”Marty is a very good motiva-
tor. -He's good [at] getting us men-
tally prepared for a meet. Stevie
and Danny do a great job in be-
ing captains,” said O’Loughlin.

O’Loughlin feels there is an ad-
vantage to home meets because

”the judges know you and they
know your routines. In a way,
seeing your routine every week
helps. Because if one weekend
you did OK, they can kind of
remember how the routine went.
So if the next weekend they think
it was better, that can help your
score.”

Some improvements that
O’Loughlin would like to make
for next year include increasing
his strength and flexibilitv.

”Chris tries hard. He has a
good spirit and a good attitude.
He'll do anything you ask. He's
very energetic,” said D’Amico.

For the past three and a half
years, O’Loughlin, whose major
is business and information
science, has worked with a
friend, installing satellite TV
dishes.

O’Loughlin summed up gym-
nastics like this: ”When you're
out there, it's just you against that
piece of equipment."

As for next year, O’Loughlin
added: ’’If everybody works what
they have to work and we get
some freshmen in and everybody
stays healthy, we're going to be
tough.”

Waynesburg falls toT
Charleston in NAIA
consolation battle

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) ~—
John Pearson had 24 points
and 12 rebounds Tuesday to
lead Charleston, S.C., to an
89-61 victory over Waynes-
burg, Pa., in the consolation
game of the NAIA men's
basketball tournament.

Pearson hit 11 of 19 from
the field for the Cougars, who
jumped off to a 34-21 halftime
lead. Waynesburg pulled to
within 47-38 with 13:12 to
play, but Charleston ticked off

eight straight points over the
next two minutes to put the
game out of reach.

Charleston, which won the
national championship in
1983, finished the season with
a 30-5 record.

The second-seeded Waynes-
burg, which lost to Grand
Canyon on a basket at the buz-
zer in the semifinals Monday
night, was led by guard Dar-
rin Walls with 22 points. The
Yellow Jackets are 32-2.

Central Catholic prepares for Erie Pre

By Matt Martin
Assistant Sports Editor

Between 1984-87, only one
team from the eastern region of
Pennsylvania has advanced to the
state Quad-A basketball champi-
onship —— Carlisle. And the Thun-
dering Herd has won the state
championship each time they've
been involved.

Carlisle, led by All-American
senior forward Billy Owens,
plays Chester tonight for the right
to enter the finals on Saturday in
Hershey and become the first

‘team to win four consecutive
state titles.

Another constant in the state
playoffs in the '80s has been Erie
Cathedral Prep, the 1980 state
champ and 1984 runner-up.

Prep is challenging again this
year, but if Pittsburgh Central
Catholic coach Chuck Crummie
has anything to do with it, it

tonight at 7:30 at Sharon High
School

”We match up pretty well with
Prep,” Crummie said. ”But their
guards are a little bit bigger, and
we're a little bit bigger on the
boards.”

But Central Catholic’s guards
could be the difference in this
game, particularly 6—foot—3 senior
Jim McCoy.

with 21 points and eight re-
bounds per game. But Crummie
said McCoy and fellow seniors
Joe Conley and Denny Schrack
may have an even larger role on
the CC team.

’’I think even though they may
not realize it, they play a key role
[as senior leadersj,” Crummie

said.

District 10 champion Prep
counters with three seniors of
their own —- guard Olivier Allei-
ni and forwards Jim Toohey and
Jim Camp.

Although Prep is not unfamiliar
with post-season play, this is the
furthest Central Catholic has ever
advanced in the state playoffs.
”We’ve been taking them one
game at a time and not worry-
ing,” Crummie said. ”We talk
about things we need to do to be
successful.”

Success has come easily for
Central Catholic this year.
Despite an early exit from the
WPIAL playoffs, CC finished
fourth in District 7 with only two
losses.

”We expected to make it fur-
ther in the WPIAL Champion-
ship,” Crummie said. But his
players have responded well
since then, winning three con-

.0/Wooao/Mia

secutive playoff games.

”|t’s a question of how our kids
responded,” Crummie said. ”|t’s
a mental blow, not physical.”

Much of the credit for their
response can go to Central
Catholic’s .top three scorers -
McCoy, Conley (14 ppg, 9rbg)
and Billy O'Brien (12 ppg, four
assists per game).

Alleini paces Prep with 14
points and six rebounds per
game, while Toohey adds 12
points and Camp contributes six
points and five rebounds.

Filling out the Rambler scoring
is junior center Steve Ziegler with
11 points and five rebounds per
game and Phil Kraus with five
points and four rebounds.

Alleini, Toohey and Camp
were voted to the Erie City All-
Star team.

Crummie said he has been tell-
ing his team to ”play one game
at a time. Just play one game, do

Gymnasts

fare well
at ECAC
Tourney

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

Five of Pitt's men's gymnasts
competed Saturday at the ECAC
Championships. They were
senior co-captains Steve Powan-
da and Dan Tarosky, sophomores
Jorge Gonzalez and Pat Pollaci,
and freshman David Has-
selbrook.

The meet had preliminaries in
the morning and finals in the
evening, in which a gymnast
needed a score of 8.95 to qualify.

Head coach Frank D'Amico
said, ”This was a successful meet.
We hit good, safe and solid
routines."

In the finals, Gonzalex finished
first on the pommel horse, scor-
ing a 9.5. He also received a 9.5
on the rings, which earned third
place. Once again, Gonzalez
didn't compete on the floor exer-
cise and the vault because of an
ankle injury.

”Jorge did a good job under
pressure,” said D’Amico.

Pollaci finished sixth in the all-
around competition with a score
of 52.7. In the finals, he placed
fifth on the floor with a 9.25, fifth
on the parallel bars with an 8.95
and sixth on the vault with a 9.1.

Powanda placed second on the
floor with a score of 9.5. D’Ami-
co said,”Steve had a really good
set on floor and it was nice to see
him go out like that.”

”David did a good job for us
and Danny just missed making fi-
nals on the rings, by five tenths
of a point," said D’Amico. ‘'50
overall, I think this was worth the
trip.”

Kite didn’t pull right
strings at tournament

By Bob Green

AP Golf Writer

PONTE VEDRA BEACH,
Fla. —— It could have been a
downer for Tom Kite.

”I had my chances. I just
wasn't able to do it,” he said
of the last—round bid that was
blunted by Paul Azinger last
Sunday in the Bay Hill Classic.

On the back nine, Kite twice
closed to within one shot of
the lead before Azinger pulled
away to a five—stroke victory.

”It would be easy to walk
away with your head down,
feeling despondent,” Kite said.

”But that serves no useful
purpose.

’’I’m looking at it as a posi-
tive,” he said before a practice
round for the $1.25 million
Players Championship that be-
gins Thursday on the tour’s
home course, the TPC at
Sawgrass.

”Obviously, I'm doing
something right. I had an ex-
cellent chance to win. It was
just not to be,” Kite said.
”When you go against a man
with a one-shot lead and he
shoots 66, he probably was
supposed to win."

”I’m looking forward to the
next couple of weeks, or the
next two tournaments I'm
playing, the Players Champi-
onship and the Masters,” Kite
said.

In the re-named Players
Championship (formerly the
Tournament Players Champi-
onship), he faces the strongest
field of the year in an event
that grows annually in
prestige.

The tournament, developed
by PCA Tour Commissioner
Deane Beman, is designed as
the annual championship of
golf’s touring pros. It is no
secret Beman aims for so-
called ”major” status; that is,
placing the Players Champion-
ship on a level with the
Masters, U.S. and British
Opens and the PGA.

”Most of the players feel that
it is a major," Kite said. ”But
that's up to the media to say.
It won't be a major until the
media says it is.”

The I44-man field, chasing
a first prize of $225,000, con-
tains all the major players in
the game, including Jack Nick-
laus, a late entrant.

HAINES CITY, Fla. - Bo and
baseball. Will he make the
choice, or will the Kansas City
Royals?

”|t’s going to be a very tough
decision,” Manager John Wathan
said. ”We might risk losing him
if B0 is sent to the minors. But we
have to do what is best for the
team.”

More likely, Bo will do what
Bo wants to do — just like he
does on the football field.

There are some, and Wathan is
among them, who believe Bo
Jackson could become the
greatest baseball player ever.

Others, including many who
have seen Jackson flail at curves
and misplay fly balls, aren't so
sure.

Then there's Bo. He's not say-
ing. Bo — he refers to himself in
the third person, as in ”Bo can be
a funny guy” — is not talking this
spring.

He says he is dedicating him-
self to baseball and wants to
avoid any distractions.

Sound familiar?

”He said he wasn't going to
play football and then he did,”

Wathan said. ”They offered him
a ton of money and he doesn't
come from a wealthy family.”

”Hey, he changed his mind,”
Wathan said. ”We all do that.”

Except that when Jackson
turned his attention to a new
”hobby,” he seemed to turn off
baseball.

Jackson was batting .253 with
18 home runs and 45 RBI in 79
games when Los Angeles Raiders
owner Al Davis signed him to a
$7.6 million, five—year contract
shortly before the All-Star break
last year. After that, Jackson hit
just .193 with four homers and
eight RBI in 37 games.

”All ofa sudden, he seemed to
drift,” teammate George Brett
said. ”He had good numbers in
July and he didn't add much to
it.”

He did, however, build his
football legacy. Jackson, a Heis-
man Trophy winner at Auburn
and No. 1 NFL draft choice, ran
for a Raiders record 221 yards in
one game and kept running over
defenders.

Brett was among many Royals
who sharply spoke out when
Jackson signed with the Raiders.
They claimed that Jackson misled
the club.

Kansas City fans skewered Jack-
son. They littered Arrowhead
Stadium with footballs when
Jackson came to town to play in
the fierce Raiders-Chiefs rivalry.

There was_ talk between Jack-
son and Royals management. At
first, it appeared Jackson would
be forced to make a choice. Roy-
als co-owner Avron Fogelman
later said there is no ultimatum,
that Jackson can play both sports.

The scars ofJackson’s feud with
the Royals seem to have healed.
There was a team meeting, some
give—and—take, and he is now one
of them, sort of.

The Royals still marvel at his
monstrous batting-practice shots
and how he runs, fast and power-
ful, with his legs apart, spraying
up dirt.

They admire his muscular
body, but no longer cluster
around him, as iftrying to win his
attention. He is just a baseball
player, albeit a special one.

There is no guarantee Bo will
be with the team on opening day.
He is competing with Gary Thur-
man to start in left field. Thurman
batted .300 throughout the
minors, impressed Wathan in
Class AAA last season and hit
.296 in 27 games with the Royals.

The following column is an
analysis of the American League
East

The New York Yankees aren't
the best team in this competitive
division, but they could be the
luckiest.

First of all, they have the most
exciting player in the AL, Ricky
Henderson. When he has the
right attitude, he can steal bases
at will. Even with an injured leg
last season, Henderson hit .291,
17 homers and had 41 steals. Not
that great but not that bad.

Next is first-baseman Don Mat-
tingly. There is nothing you can
say that hasn’t already been said.

Dave Winfield is growing old
and has been mentioned in trade
rumors, the latest being a one-on-
one deal for league MVP George
Bell of Toronto. The crazy thing
is that the Yankees might be just

as good with either one. Winfield
knocked in 97 runs last season
and is a leader on and off the
field.

Meanwhile, Bell was simply
the most feared player in the AL.
He pounded out 47 homers, 134
RBIs and topped it off with a .308
average. He can be disruptive,
but with stats like that, who
cares?

Jack Clark and his 35 round-
trippers will only add to the
Yanks’ success.

The pitching is better than
everyone thinks. Ron Guidry can-
not have three bad years in a row.
Rick Rhoden won 16 games last
season, and there is no reason he
can't do it again. Richard Dotson
will do much better away from
Chicago, and Tommy John is
baseball's version of Old Faithful.

Of course, there is always Dave
Righetti in the bullpen — only the
best reliever around for the

VINCE

CAREY  

money.

The Yanks have always thrived
on pressure. They should receive
a lot from owner George Stein-
brenner and manager Billy Mar—
tin, so watch out.

Wait a minute, the Toronto
Blue Jays finished second last
year. They should be the heirs ap-
parent this year.

But the Blue Jays will not win
the East under manager Jimmy
Williams. He plays favorites too
often with his players, and now
he wants to get rid of Bell.

The Jays won't win without
Bell, and not even a Winfield
would be able to step into his
shoes.

The only reason Toronto will

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 23, I988

finish in second is that its pitch-
ing staff is better than the rest.

But pitching doesn't win cham-
pionships in this day and age.

Plain and simple, the Boston
Red Sox are not that good.

Their starting pitching is thin
behind Roger Clemens. He is ob-
viously a quality starter. In fact,
he is the best in the AL. A 2.97
ERA in only 282 innings is
phenomenal. Clemens can even
get non—Sox fans to cheer him.

”Oil Can” Boyd doesn't care
enough about baseball. Bruce
Hurst is inconsistent. There are
too many youngsters the rest of
the way.

Of course, big Lee Smith is in
the bullpen. But he’ll have to
save 50 games and average five
innings an outing to put the Sox
into contention.

Sam Horn is one of the most
exciting power hitters to make
the scene. Last season, he hit 14

Yankees ready to capture flag in AL east

homers in just 158 at-bats. Plus,
he has the added distinction of
looking like a taller Mike Tyson.
Any pitcher who faces him will
be shaking in his shoes.

Wade Boggs. ’Nuff said.

All this plus those not men-
tioned add up to a third—place
finish.

The Detroit Tigers can't win
because they won last year. A

If everyone on the team had
career years, they still wouldn't
win because teams just don't
repeat in the '80s.

Maybe manager Tom Trebel-
horn should drink some more
beer. That way his Milwaukee
Brewers will look better than
they actually are.

The team that won 91 games
last season and still finished in
third has made no changes.

They rely too much on the

offensive exploits oflim Gantner.

LaValliere adjusts to Pirates’ style of play

BRADENTON, Fla. —- Just

fan — LaVal|iere turned out to be
one of the best catches of the
1987 season.

And one of the best catchers.

LaVal|iere, a .234 hitter for the
St. Louis Cardinals in 1986, bat-
ted .300 after being traded to the
Pirates in April. And, more impor-
tantly to him, he won the Gold
Glove for being the National
League's premier defensive
catcher.

Not bad for a somewhat port-
ly, unathletic-looking guy, who at
5-foot-9 and 190 pounds, looks
like he stepped right out of a Lite
Beer commercial.

”The Gold Glove was impor-
tant to me,” LaVa|Iiere said at the
Pirates’ spring training camp. ’’I

signed as a third baseman in
1982, then the next year they said
to me, ‘Son, you're a catcher.’ I
had a hard enough time at first
just catching the ball.”

LaValliere, 27, won the Cardi-
nals’ starting catching job in the
second half of the 1986 season,
then suddenly found himself
headed to Pittsburgh just when
he was starting to feel secure in
St. Louis.

Just as it was at first for fellow
ex-Cardinals Andy Van Slyke and
Mike ‘Dunne, the trade was a
stunner and a big disappoint-
ment. And there was the realiza-
tion that he was replacing the
Pirates’ most popular player,
Tony Pena.

”My first impression was, ’Oh,
no, not Pittsburgh,’ ” LaVal|iere
said. ”But as soon as I met
[Manager] Jim Leyland and his
staff, I started getting excited
about baseball again. I tried not
to put too much pressure on my-
self at first, and luckily, I got off
to a good start.”

He wound up hitting .300 with
one home run (off Nolan Ryan)
with 36 runs batted in and led
major league catchers in throw-
ing out runners attempting to

steal, nailing 49 in 115 attempts. 6

His fellow Pirates selected him
their ”Players’ Player" for
demonstrating leadership, con-
sistency and hustle. He also
earned rave reviews from Ley-
land and pitching coach Ray
Miller for his handling of the
Pirates’ young pitching staff.

LaVaIliere said his career took
off when he finally realized he
could be successful even without
hitting 25 homers or making $2
million a season.

’’I never thought I was a .230
hitter, but it was just a case of
maturing and trying not to be a
hitter I could never be,” he said.
”I was under the impression that
to stay in the big leagues, I was
going to have to hit 15, 20 home

runs a year; and that's basically ‘

what I tried to do.

”I finally realized my job on
this team is not to hit home runs
but to play defense and to catch.”

He caught some grief at first
from Pirate fans because he was
replacing Pena, but he said, ’’I
knew they wouldn't stay down
on me for long because of the
way I play.’’

A blue-collar player in a blue-
collar town, Lavalliere gets his
uniform dirty, hustles and rarely
makes mistakes. He said he's
now the player he is because he
no longer is the player he can't

be.

”The guys who make the big‘

salaries are pretty much the big
run-producers, and when you're
in the major leagues, there's a
certain amount of pressure about
putting up some kind of power
stats,” he said. T

”You don't get the fanfare from
playing defense the way you do
hitting the ball out of the ballpark.

I finally realized I had to do the I 

things I do best — play defense,
put the ball in play to all fields.
It only took me 27 years.”

Injured Thomas may redshirt next season

3. STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -

Penn State tailback Blair Thomas,
who rushed for 1,414 yards last
season, is recovering faster than
expected from a January knee
operation, his surgeon an-
nounced Tuesday.

”Blair’s progress after eight
weeks is ahead of anyone we’ve
ever treated who has undergone
the same surgery,” said Dr. Alex-
ander Kalenak, an orthopedic

su rgeon.

Thomas, whose single-season
rushing total last year was the
third best in Penn State history,
injured his right knee during an
informal practice Dec. 9 before
the Citrus Bowl against Clemson.

It has been 450 years, give or
take a decade, since Michelange-
lo took his pail of paint to the ceil-
ing of the Sistine Chapel. Well,
what are we waiting for, folks°
Grab a roller. It's about time to
give the place a new coat.

Hey, ifthey can install lights at
Wrigley Field, then nothing is off-
limits. All in the interest of
progress, you understand.

You want progress? Let's put
Astroturf at Augusta National.
Think of all the mowing time and
water they would save.

You want progress? Aluminum
siding would certainly dress up
Boston Garden. It's maintenance-
free, you know, so it should fit
right into the building's free-of-
maintenance tradition.

You want progress? How about
knocking down the Los Angeles
Coliseum and putting up condos?
The lrwindale Raiders aren't go-
ing to need the joint much
longer, anyway.

On March 15, voters in 21
precincts around Wrigley Field
voted on an advisory referendum

A 1 in the lllinois primary election to

express their opinion of the latest
bit of progress — lights for the
venerable stadium. The vote can-
not change the go—ahead that
Chicago's city fathers granted this
controversial construction project
last month.

By the sheerest of coinci-
dences, on the morning of the
city council's final vote, the
philanthropists who operate
major league baseball an-
nounced that the 1990 All—Star
Game would be awarded to
Wrigley Field. Oh, yes, there was
one little condition attached: the
park would, of course, have to be
equipped with lights by then or
we'll just have to put the game
someplace else. But don't let that
affect the way you vote, Mr.
Councilman.

They certainly are subtle, aren't
they?

Not surprisingly, the vote went
baseball's way and, by August,
the electric bill at Wrigley Field
is expected to increase substan-
tially. They are talking about
playing eight night games there in

He missed the bowl game and
underwent arthroscopic recon-
struction of a ligament Jan. 11 at
the Milton S. Hershey Medical
Center.

Thomas can now walk without
crutches but continues to protect
the knee with a brace, Penn State
said in the announcement.

”Blair has full range of motion,
and there is no evidence of any
looseness in the knee,” Kalenak
said.

Thomas has been working on
his endurance by bicycling and
swimming, according to the
university.

Penn State Coach Joe Paterno
last season called Thomas, a

21-year-old junior from Philadel-
phia, the best all-around back he
had ever coached and the lead-
ing candidate to win the 1988
Heisman Trophy.

Thomas has said he would sit
out the 1988 season as a red shirt
if he had not recovered fully.

Kalenak said he hoped Tho-
mas’ strength would be restored
by the end of May to start running
and agility drills in June and July,
and to be ready for the start of
practice in August.

Two other regulars are expect-
ed to miss much of the spring
practice schedule.

Fullback John Greene has been
troubled by a thigh bruise and

Aoatoa Polamalu by a knee inju-
ry that sidelined him for all of the
1986 season.

Three freshmen who saw ac-
tion last season will help fill in for
Thomas and Greene during
spring practice: tailbacks Leroy
Thompson and Gary Brown and
fullback Sam Gash.

Brown was the Nittany Lions’
third leading rusher behind Tho-
mas and Greene with 273 yards.

Sean Barowski, a junior full-
back, and Sean Redman, a senior
tailback, also are expected to take
on an increased spring workload.

”The running back situation is
one that will literally be evaluat-
ed day by day,” Paterno said.

”We need to determine how to
get the most out of the backs we
have/’

Thomas injured a crossing liga-
ment on the inside of his right
knee, preventing the knee from
sliding backward and forward,
according to Mac Evarts, dean of
Penn State’s College of Medicine.

Evarts, at a Penn State board of
trustees meeting in January, said
the rehabilitation from an injury
to that ligament usually is
difficult.

Thomas’ single-season rushing
mark last season trails only Lydell
Mitchell's 1,567 yards in 1971
and John Cappelletti’s 1,522
yards in 1973.

goodness, he has not turned them
into robots.

Smith seems like he had a pret-
ty good idea what to do. Call
timeout or foul. If he fouled Go-
heen, and by some miraculous
act of God, Vanderbilt was still
able to win, fine. Smith would
have had to face the music. But
the chances of Pitt losing the
game in that situation are less
than the cliances of Goheen mak-
ing his fatal jumper.

Obviously Smith made his
statements in the locker room out
of frustration. But blaming his

coaches didn't help matters.

Smith, Gore and Lane havem‘.

suffered enough mental anguish
under the Chipman regime
when, because of many circum-
stances, the players learned not
to believe in themselves. Yes,
even with a team that won the
Big East regular season champi-
onship, self—doubt has still been
problematic for the Panther up-
perclassmen.

That's why Pitt's freshman class“
was so refreshing, and played so “

well this year. These kids hadn't
failed under Chipman. Coming
straight from high school, they
just wanted to play, and win.
They had no se|f—doubts about
the team's ability to win big
games, especially on the road.
The freshmen pulled through in
wins at West Virginia, St. John's,
Providence and "Connecticut.

Unfortunately, this loss, in
which the team captain criticized
the coaches, will stick in the
freshmen’s minds for the rest of
their Pitt careers.

Smith second guessed Evans
and his staff on Sunday. The Pan-
thers’ marvelously talented, but
highly impressionable freshmen,
will remember Smith’s doubts for
the next three seasons.

East

(34), Robin Yount (I32) and Paul
Molitor (31). The only bright spot
is catcher B.J. Surhoff (23).

Their pitching can win some
games, but overall, it's a little too
young to carry a team in any kind
of offensive slump.

What kind of world am I in?
The papers are raving about the
Baltimore Orioles.

It says that the unheralded Rick
Schu has been an answer to all
of their problems. in fact, Schu is
on the way to being the first
triple-crown winner since Carl
Yastremski. Terry Kennedy has
been amazing, hitting 57 homers.
Lee Lacy was off to a tough start
but caught fire in September.

The pitchers could be the best
in America. Mike Boddicker is
fighting teammate Dave Schmidt
for the Cy Young Award.

The funny thing is that they are
still going to finish in sixth place.

The Cleveland Indians were
bad last season and will be bad
again this year.

There are too many things
wrong with this club to fix in one
winter, and management appar-
ently hasn't even tried.

The lineup has too many per-
sonalities, and the pitching is too
thin to win.

Those in charge have banished
the Indians to the cellar.

ball at Pitt can best be described
as fantastic. She helped lead the
Lady Panthers to a combined
record of 89-29 in that time, cul-
minating with NCAA tournament
appearances by Pitt the last two
seasons.

Stewart has been named to the
Big East All-Tournament Team
the last three years as well as be-
ing named MVP of the 1986 tour-

 nament.

In addition to her selection to
the Big East All—Tournament
Team, Stewart was a top gun for
Pitt in several other tourneys. She
was named all-tournament in the
Temple invitational as well as be-
ing selected MVP of the Buckeye
Classic in which she led the Lady
Panthers to wins over Ohio State
and Penn State.

Over the last three years Lisa's
game has improved to the point
where she is considered one of
the most powerful outside hitters
ever to emerge out of the east.
With a powerful right arm which
propels the ball as if shot out of
a cannon and a 29-inch vertical
jump,‘it is easy to see why.

At the conclusion of the past
season, Stewart played in the in-
augural Yugo East—West All-Star
Volleyball Classic.

Cubs

Continued from page 17

T988 and T8 in 1989.

This touchy business of lights
for Wrigley has been on the
minds of the bosses of baseball
for a long time now. In 1984,
when the Cubs threatened to win
the pennant — the threat was, as
usual, nothing more than an idle
one — there was talk of playing
Chicago's portion of the World
Series in nearby St. Louis, which
is, after all, only a state or so
away.

That outrageous proposal never
got beyond the talking stage, but
the very fact that it was consi-
dered at all is evidence of how
cavalierly baseball trifles with the
game's traditions.

The St. Louis ploy was an at-
tempt to accommodate baseball's
perceived need to conduct its
glamour events at night for the
benefit of greater television ex-
posure and revenue.

That is why West Coast World
Series and All-Star games start at
twilight, which is prime time in
the East. Twilight is sort of a half-
way house between day and
night, when the game's best hit-
ters are rendered helpless by the
dwindling light. Hang the hitters.
We need night games. We play
night games. Full steam ahead.

Some things, however, are best
left alone. Confucious, or maybe
it was Casey Stengel, once said,
’’If it ain't broke, don't fix it.”

There are people who believe
Wrigley Field, with its vines
climbing the outfield walls and
brick backstop behind home
plate and daytime baseball, is far
from broken. The place has func-
tioned quite nicely for a long
time, thank you, without any help
from Commonwealth Edison.
Why that needs to change now
is not entirely clear.

Will Andre Dawson hit better
or Rick Sutcliffe pitch better or
Don Zimmer manage better at
night?

It's unlikely.

Will the Cubs win the pennant
at night?

Are you kidding?
