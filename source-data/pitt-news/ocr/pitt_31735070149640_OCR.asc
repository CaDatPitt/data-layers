SGB, Landreneau hold
first town hall meeting

Informal atmosphere fosters conversation

By Gideon Bradshaw
Staﬁ” Writer

Vincent Mattiola needed between
$50,000 and $70,000 to buy sail-
boats — he just wasn’t sure how
to ask.

As founder of the Panther Sail-
ing Club, the sophomore had to
ﬁnd a way to fund the activities of
the club — which has never actu-
ally sailed. So he joined about 40
other students during Tuesday
night’s ﬁrst ever Pitt town hall,
an initiative spearheaded by Stu-
dent Government Board President
James Landreneau.

During the informal meeting,
‘students met with members of SGB
and Pitt Vice Provost and Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey.

“It was a good environment
for everyone to reach out to the
Board,” Landreneau said, adding
that the casual atmosphere allowed
students to have one—on—one con-

versations with SGB members.

The town hall meetings will be
open to all students and serve as
an informal forum with SGB mem-
bers. Town halls will be held on
the ﬁrst Tuesday of every month
at 7:30 p.m., before the weekly
Board meeting. Landreneau said
that he will make alternative ar-
rangements for March because of
the spring break schedule. The aim
of the forums is to supplement the
open ﬂoor portion of SGB meetings
and give students a place to discuss
concerns with allocations and pose
general questions to the Board
without having to sit through al-
locations requests.

Mattiola, who started the Pan-
ther Sailing Club last November,
paired, up with Allocations Com-
mittee member Alana Miller to
discuss his funding dilemma.

The Panther Sailing Club has
more than 35 active members but

Corbett proposes 30 percent cu

By Gwenn Barney
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

Another proposed budget, another
blow to higher education.
Gov. Tom Corbett announced

on Tuesday his $27.4 billion state 0

budget proposal, which slashed
spending and suggested cutting
Pitt’s state funding by 30 percent
— from $136 million to $95.2 mil-
lion — for the coming ﬁscal year.

“One of our core functions is to
provide for education at several lev-
els, starting with our youngest. We
have less money than Iwould like,
so we must adapt,” Corbett said in
his annual budget address.

The proposed cuts to higher
education mark the biggest per-
centage cut in Corbett’s 2012-2013
budget, which aims to reduce
spending without raising taxes.

This year’s proposed budget is an

$866 million reduction from the .

2011-2012 budget.

Last year, Corbett proposed
a 50 percent cut to state support
for the four state-related univer-
sities, although the ﬁnal budget
passed with only a 19 percent chop
to the funding of Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln. To help ﬁll the
resulting $40 million budget gap,
Pitt raised in—state tuition by 8.5
percent and out-of—state tuition
by 4 percent.

The state-related universities
were also hit by a spending freeze
injanuary that reduced Pitt’s yearly
expenditures by 5 percent.

On Tuesday, Chancellor Mark

' Nordenberg released a statement

that, while acknowledging the
need to make difficult sacriﬁces
in drafting the state budget, said
the University would be unfairly

affected by the proposed cuts.

“And what we must resist ——
not only for ourselves but for the
many who depend upon us — are
disproportionately deep cuts that
threaten our ability to continue
making critical contributions, ei-
ther to deserving individuals or
to a vibrant, more productive so-
ciety,” he said.

In the statement, Nordenberg
included a message to the Pitt com-
munity about what’s to come as the
budget process develops.

“This is just the beginning of the
state’s budget-building process. We

now will move through legislative

hearings and will seek to advance
our case in other settings as well.
Knowing the daunting challenge
that we now face, we need to build
upon the outstanding advocacy
efforts undertaken by students,
faculty, staff and alumni during

to Pitt state funding

the budget—building process last
year,” he said.

The chancellor also noted in the
statement that the University will
fashion its operating budget for
the next ﬁscal year according to
the proposed funding cuts.

Of the four state-related univer-
sities, three will see cuts under the
proposed budget.

In addition to Pitt’s reduction,
the state budget would cut $64.2
million from Penn State’s funding
and $41.9 million from Temple’s.
Lincoln University will receive
$11.2 million, the same it received
last year.

The proposed budget also in-
cludes a 20 percent cut in fund-
ing for the State System of Higher
Education, which includes Penn-
sylvania’s 14 state schools.

Corbett explained in the ad-
dress the necessity of his “lean and

demanding” budget as an alterna-
tive to taxation.

“We will not raise taxes,” Cor-
bett said. “There is no talking
around these limits. Every dollar
taken in tax is one less dollar in
the hands of a job—holder or a job-
creator. Every dollar spent is one
less dollar in the sector that creates
real prosperity.”

Aside from budget line items,
Corbett announced the formation
of a Higher Education Advisory
Panel. Nordenberg will serve as
one of 30 members, the rest of
whom will include other univer-
sity administrators, educators and
prominent business leaders.

The Board’s roles will include
reviewing education policies,
examining how to make higher

-education more affordable for stu-

currently receives no funding. In-
stead of sailing, members sit in
a classroom while an instructor
teaches sailing race theory on a
chalkboard. ‘ V

Mattiola intends to change that

by requesting an allotment from-
the Student Activities Fund, an
allocation that he says will go to
building seven two—person sail-
boats. He said that although his
request for $50,000 or more adds
up to a hefty sum, the boats should
last the club 10 to 15 years.

Mattiola asked Miller how to
phrase his request in order to fa-
cilitate the long-term goal of his
club, which is to compete as part of
the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Asso-
ciation rather than as an informal
group of sailors from Pitt. ‘

Miller helped Mattiola clarify
the phrasing of his request. 4

“It’s the difference between stu-
dents representing the University
and students who are simply from
the University,” Mattiola said.

In addition to opening up
communication, the town hall
also served to keep students in-
formed.

Former Academic Affairs Com-
mittee Chair Pooja Patel began the

ART AND NATURAL HISTORY

 

     

 

town hall meeting with a presen-

tation on Gov. Tom Corbett’s re- .'

cently released budget proposal
that would cut Pitt’s state funding
by 30 percent. .

A Patel urged students to vote
 explained that under Corbett’s
plan, Pitt’s funding will decrease
from $136 million to $95 million
in the next ﬁscal year.

“I think it’s safe to say that the
majority of [Pitt students] don’t
beneﬁt from these policies,” Patel
said.

Allocations Committee Chair
Mike Nites said that as clubs start
to prepare for next fall, many stu-
dents are looking for information
on how to receive funding from

. the Student Activities Fund — and
the town hall provides them with
opportunities to ask about alloca-
tions.

“I think a lot of people are ask-
ing questions they wouldn’t have
otherwise come to our ofﬁce for,”
N ites said.

dents and taxpayers and looking into “how
higher education can increase collaboration
with the private sector and government,”
according to a press release issued by Cor-
bett’s office.

In his statement, Nordenberg expressed
optimism that the panel’s work could re-
sult in an end to higher—education funding
cuts.

“One can never predict how a group pro-
cess ultimately will unfold, and it certainly
would have been far better if the commis-
sion announced by the governor had been

at work beforeiwe were targeted for such
deep and disproportionate cuts to our state
funding. Still, if the commission lives up to
its potential, it could shape the face of public
higher education in Pennsylvania for years
to come,” he said.

State General Assembly representatives
for the Oakland community were quick to
state their opposition to the governor’s bud-
get. State Sens.]im Ferlo andjay Costa, both
D—Pittsburgh, were unavailable for comment
but did release statements opposing the
governor’s budget proposal.

Democratic state Rep. Dan Frankel,
whose 23rd District includes Pitt as well as
Carlow, CMU and Chatham, said that higher
education is crucial for the economic vitality

of his district.

“The University of Pittsburgh has been
an enormous economic engine that has
shielded western Pennsylvania from the
worst of the recession by being a consistent
job creator,” he said.

Frankel also said he was worried about
cuts to public education in the proposed
budget, as well as about the state of public
transportation in the western part of the
state, which he described as in “crisis.”

Frankel called for advocates of higher

. education to campaign for sources of rev-

enue — such as a higher tax on Marcellus

Shale drilling than the one that passed the .

state Senate Tuesday — as a solution to the
budget cuts.

“lt’s only reasonable
to think that higher
tuition will also
happen this year
going forward.”

-9 Wayne Fontana

State Sen. Wayne Fontana, whose 42nd
District encompasses parts of Pittsburgh
and the surrounding municipalities, also
opposes the proposed education cuts.

. 5‘It’s not good news,” Fontana said. “It’s

' only reasonable to think that higher tuition

will also happen this year going forward.
What -we plan to do is to be a voice for all of
you [at Pitt]. We’re screaming and kicking
andscratching. But the strategy is also for
those of you in universities out there to get
involved and be a voice also.” -

SGB President James Landreneau said
that in recent weeks, his organization has
already gotten a head start on following
Fontana’s advice. .

Over the past few weeks, Landreneau has
attended meetings with members of Pitt’s
Government Relations Ofﬁce to plan reactive
steps to Corbett’s proposed cuts.

“We want to promote more student feed-
back and encourage more students to attend
Pitt Day in Harrisburg,” Landreneau said
about the rally planned for March 13.

The SGB president also said that other .

plans are in the works, such as a collabora-
tive letter-writing campaign in conjunction
with Pitt’s Graduate School of Public and_
International Affairs and College of General
Studies, measures to spread Pitt students’
personal stories and efforts to meet with all
Pitt clubs to generate support.

In addition to the cuts to higher educa-
tion, the proposed budget includes the dis-
missal of 1,550 state workers, a $1.5 billion
dollar cut to public education, a $24.1 million
cut to conservation and natural resources
and a $5.3 million cut to the funding of ag-
riculture, among other trimmings.

The budget includes signiﬁcant increases
for public welfare, which will receive a $607.7
million funding increase. The increase will
go toward medical assessment and care for
mental health and intellectual disabilities.
But within the same department of public
welfare, funding will simultaneously be cut
from; child welfare, cash grants and child
development.

Military and Veterans Affairs and state
police could also see increases of $19.7 mil-

lion and $10 million, respectively, in their.

funding under Corbett’s proposed budget.
For the ﬁrst time in 10 years, no signiﬁ-

cant funding increase is planned for the

Department of Corrections. I

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Buyer’s remorse akin to bad food

A Market Central binge islike those ho—hum free agent acquisitions

y Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 
 

As Valentine’s Day approaches,

the time has come to address a

burning question: What the heck -

are our beloved Pittsburgh Pirates
doing? Are we supposed to be ex-

cited about the fact that washed— .

up, replacement—level'players like
Rod Barajas, Nate McLouth, Erik
Bedard, Clint Barmes and Jo-Jo
Reyes are joining the team? E

But here’s the bigger question:
How should we feel about any free
agent signing that doesn’t involve
the likes of baller nonpareil LeBron
James or beer-barrel-shaped ﬁrst

baseman Prince Fielder? Should ,

we care, even a teensy weensy bit,
that the Steelers might add veteran
wide receiver and noted malcon—‘
tent Braylon Edwards to their ros-
ter? Or that lumbering center Chris
Kaman could wind up playing for

' ' the Charlotte Bobcats?

Free agency —' which was al-
ways a big deal‘ for fans of Major
League Baseball, at least during
the era when many of those players
were allegedly visiting “anti-aging”
clinics in the offseason — serves
as excellent ﬁller for sports pages
around the country. And some-
times, as in the case of last year’s
ludicrously overhyped “Dream
Team” Philadelphia Eagles, it al-
lows Writers to let their imagina-
tions run wild, believing that add-
ing a bunch of thirty—something
athletes will enable their teams to
beat up on the likesof perpetual
bottom—feeders like the Cleveland

Browns andjacksohvillejaguars. »

Yet the majority of free agent
signings amount to very little, and
for good reason: Most players who
reach free agency areold, weren’t
that good to begin with and prob-
ably won’t be getting much better.
This is especially true in the case of
sports like basketball and football,
where nearly -every participant
winds up suffering catastrophic
knee injuries, and the ones who
don’t eventually develop debilita-
tive arthritis. Don’t believe us?Just
listen to the chatter down in Mar-
ket Central, where on any given
day you’re bound to encounter a
dozen or more bros waxing nos-

talgic about their short-circuited -

football careers.

In fact, Market Central is a ﬁne
way to visualize the process of ac-
quiring free agents. Pretend for a
moment that you’re Pirates Gen-
eral Manager Neal Huntington,
and it’s been several hours since
you’ve eaten. You’re not working
with a lot of Panther Funds, which
means that the better, healthier
options are out. But you do need
to ﬁll your stomach -— and keep
it ﬁlled — over the course of the
next 250 days. So you wind up se-
lecting a hamburger and a grilled

_ cheese.

But here’s the thing: Having se-
lected that hamburger and grilled
cheese, you’re now required to pro-
mote the crap out of them. This
entails hanging banners from the
sides of your stadium touting the
appearance of the grilled cheese.
It means taking the hamburger

to local sporting goods stores,

and having it sign autographs for
the 20 or so tee—ball players who
were dragged to the event by their
jock—snifﬁng parents. It consists of
going on a local sports-radio talk
show and lying through your teeth
as you tell the blowhard host that
the grilled cheese is the missing
piece of a championship puzzle.
And you, in the role of GM Hun-
tington, will have to do this over
and over again. Sometimes you’ll

Danielle Hu I Staff Illustrator

even come into possession of an
under—ripe piece of fruit, whereup-
on you’ll ﬁnd yourself responsible
for assuring the faithful that, yes,
one day the fruit will ripen, and it
will be delicious. But not this year,
people. That piece of fruit might
be batting below the Mendoza
Line and playing a mediocre third
base, but he’s our power hitter of
the future. Have a little patience,
would you?

Whenever our hometown teams
fail to win, we hurry to assign all
of the blame to management. Why
on earth did they sign a loser like
Jake Delhomme to a multiyear
deal? What were they thinking?
Yet consider this: Why on Earth
did you eat that Big Mac? What
were you thinking when you pur-
chased that package of Twinkies?
Granted, the dollar amounts in-
volved in purchasing the foods are
much lower, but the fact remains
that we all make a host of instantly
regrettable decisions on a daily
basis. We make these decisions be-
cause, try as we might, we can’t do
absolutely nothing (and goodness
knows the Pirates, among others,
have tried).

It is in this sense that famed
point guard and erstwhile New
York Knicks President Isiah Thom-
as had perhaps the greatest run

Talih Zanna (No. 42) and the ‘Pitt men’s

By R] Sepich
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
considers itself undefeated.
Following the team’s eighth
consecutive loss against Louisville
onjan. 21, the players and coaches
decided to forget about all of their
struggles and pretend to begin a

HEW season.

The Panthers (15—9, 4-7 Big
East) haven’t lost since.

“Things have definitely
changed,” junior center Dante
Taylor said. “But we always be-

lieved in ourselves and knew we
could do it.”

Sophomore forward Lamar
Patterson said it’s no coincidence
that Pitt’s current four—game win
streak began right after starting
point guard Travon Woodall re-
turned from his abdominal and
groin injuries.

“Since he came back, we’ve been
playing a whole lot better collec-
tively,” Patterson said. “just having
him out there gives everyone spirit
to get wins.”

Pitt’s record with Woodall in
the lineup is 10-3, whereas the

basl<etball team will look tolwin their fifth straight game tonight.

Panthers went 5-6 without their
point guard.

Wednesday night, Woodall —
named the Big East Player of the
Week on Monday — and the Pan-
thers will put their “undefeated”

. season on the line when they travel

to South Florida to face the Bulls
(13-10, 6-4 Big East) at 7 p.m.

Panthers victorious in

season's firstquad meet  

By Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

The Pitt gymnastics team earned
its highest team score in two years
when it picked up its ﬁrst victory of
the 2012 season Saturday.

The Panthers hosted their
ﬁrst quad meet of the year at the
Fitzgerald Field House and swept
the competition with a 194.550
overall team score, their best since
a 194.650 performance against
Penn State in 2010.

Pitt head coach Debbie Yohman
said that commitment to a larger
team goal drives her squad to per-
form well.

“Our season goals are to win the
East Atlantic Gymnastics League
and qualify for the NCAA Tourna-
ment as a team,” Yohman said. “Ev-
eryone is focused on answering the

questions, ‘What do I do to make

the team better?’ and ‘What I just
did, did it help the team?”’

Sophomore Katie O’Rourke
agreed with her coach, saying that
an EAGL team championship would
be a great accomplishment.

“Everyone is putting in a tre-
mendous amount of effort to make
becoming EAGL champions come
true,” O’Rourke said. “It’s reward-
ing to be part of a team that shares
the same goal.”

Pitt started the season with
three consecutive losses. The
Panthers fell 193.850-189.65 to
Maryland in their season opener
onjan. 13 and then lost a close meet
with New Hampshire on the road
194.150—193.725.

The Panthers also kept close
in a meet against No. 11 Ohio
State, eventually losing 195.625-
193.500.

The Panthers defeated George
Washington, Rutgers and William
8: Mary on Saturday night. George
Washington and Rutgers compete
with Pitt in the EAGL, and the two
wins offset the Panthers’ previous
season losses to fellow confer-
ence members Maryland and New
Hampshire.

In addition to posting an im-
pressive overall score, the Panthers

also recorded their highest marks
of the season on the bars and the
floor events with scores of 48.300
and 49.075, respectively.

Teamwork was particularly
evident in the ﬂoor event as four
Panthers contributed to the sea-
son-high score.

O’Rourke placed ﬁrst out of 24
with a career—best 9.875 score,
while senior Alicia Talucci tied
her career—best score of 9.850 in
a second-place ﬁnish. Freshmen
Haley Bodenheimer and Haley
Sedgewick tied for third, complet-
ing the Panthers’ sweep.

So far this season, the rookie
Panthers have been major con-
tributors to team scoring. Sedge-
wick placed ﬁfth out of 24 on the
uneven bars in the quad meet and
ﬁnished the night in ﬁfth place in
the all-around competition with a
personal-best score of 38.625.

Bodenheimerwas named EAGL  ’

Rookie of the Week for the week
preceding the quad meet based
on her performance against No. 11
Ohio State onjan. 27. In that meet,
Bodenheimer won the all-around
competition, and she’s currently
the leadingiEAGL scorer in the ﬂoor
event. i

Bodenheimer said that the hon-
or shows she’s working toward her
ultimate goal.

“As an incoming freshman, I
wanted to contribute to Pitt gym-
nastics and make the team bet-
ter,” Bodenheimer said. “By being
named Rookie of the Week, others
must feel that I am achieving this
goal.”

Her success continued on Sat-
urday as she posted a career-best
all-around score of 39.025, placing
her in the second spot out of nine,
just behind Rutgers’ Alexis Gunzel—
man and her 39.075 tally.

In the balance beam compe-
tition, the Panthers once again
boasted the top three ﬁnishers out
of 24, this time with scoring across
three different academic classes.

Bodenheimer won the event
with a career—high score of 9.825.
Sophomore O’Rourke and senior
Amy Varela followed, tying for sec-

GREGORIAN RANTS

Pitt already on bubble

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

For the Pitt men’s basketball team, there is
no long, Cardiac Hill march to the NCAA
Tournament.

It’s a gentle crest at this point. The Pan-
thers are already on the bubble.

“Bracketologist” Joe Lunardi of ESPN
named Minnesota, Arizona, Seton Hall and
North Carolina State as the ﬁnal four schools
that would make the Tournament if it started
Monday. Although Lunardi has no inﬂuence

MCT Campus
't3Ct.vnn and Seton Hail split their scrixss .

on the selection committee —- and guessing
the 37th at-large bid is always a lottery game
for sports nerds — he gives afairly accurate
sample of the minimum resumé needed for
a ticket to the Big Dance.

So _let’s take a look at the “last four in”
school with which Pitt is most familiar: Seton
Hall. The Pirates are 15-8 overall and 4-7 in
the Big East.

They bested Connecticut at home 75-63
when the Huskies were ranked No. 8. A strong
victory against Colonial Athletic Association

powerhouse Virginia Commonwealth high— .

lighted Seton Hall’s nonconference schedule,
which also featured resumé—padding wins
over the New Jersey Institute of Technol-
ogy, Longwood, Mercer (in overtime) and
St. Francis College (also in overtime).
Connecticut avenged its earlier loss by
trouncing the Pirates 69-46 last weekend.
Seton Hall also lost to South Florida, Vil-
lanova, Notre Dame, Louisville and Mar-
quette —— all in a row, actually. The Pirates
haven’t won since Jan. 10, when they beat
DePaul. ' I ~
Seton Hall does have the 13th—hardest
schedule in the nation, but with losses to
all the “hard” opponents (the Orange, the
Irish, the Cardinals and the Golden Eagles)

it doesn’t mean much.

V Pitt, with the 24th-toughest schedule,
possesses the same 4-7 Big East record as
the Pirates. The two share losses at Syracuse:
Pitt by eight, Seton Hall by 26. They share
wins over West Virginia, single-digit losses at
Marquette and double—digit losses to Notre
Dame. While Seton Hall beat St. Francis of
New York, Pitt beat Saint Francis University
of Pennsylvania. p

Both teams are 1-3 against schools ranked
in the coaches’ poll. The Panthers beat No.
10 Georgetown three weeks after Seton Hall
felled the Huskies, an opponent that has
since lost its Top 25 luster. V’ -

If you strip away the ,names “Panthers”
and “Pirates,” it’s tough tb distinguish which
program is supposedly more qualiﬁed for the
Tournament than the other. V

Seton Hall trumps Pitt in one category:
RPI. The Ratings Percentage Index weighs a
team’s winning percentage (25 percent of the
index), its opponents’ winning percentage
(50 percent) and its opponents’ opponents’
winning percentage (25 percent) for the sake
of comparison. Through Monday’s games,
the Pirates are ranked No. 33, whereas the
Panthers are No". 64.  _

Wake Forest, Northwestern and Aubur

« -— three of Seton Hall’s nonconference op-

ponents — have played 11 non—Big East teams
currently ranked in the Top 25, whichis great
news for the Pirates’ RPI.

But Seton Hall’s RPI is an exception to
the bubble norm. Remember the other last
teams in: Minnesota, North Carolina State
and Arizona? They are Nos._ 50, 56 and 66 in
RPI, respectively. The Golden Gophers and
the Wolfpack, like the Panthers, each have
one win over aranked team. The Wildcats
have none. A

Arizona’s resumé highlight is an over-

' time loss at No. 12 Florida, 78-72. The Pac-

12 schedule doesn’t have a ranked team for
the 16-8 Wildcats to face, or anything close
to it.

. Pitt has a better RPI than Wyoming, Colo-

' rado and Stanford, three of Lunardi’s.ﬁrst
.eight teams left out of the Tournament. It _

also topped the rank of Texas, another bubble
team, until the Longhorns beat Texas A&M
Monday. 1

The Panthers have two bad losses to
teams outside the RPI Top 100 — Rutgers
and DePaul — but so does everybody else
on the bubble. That’s why it’s the bubble.
Texas surrendered 100 points to Oregon
State. Wyoming lost to Green Bay and Texas
Christian. '

Pitt has Travon Woodall healthy and av-
eraging 14.8 points and 5.8 assists per game
since his return. The Panthers have won four
straight games, and you won’t ﬁnd many
analysts picking South Florida or slumping
Seton Hall to beat them this week.

The long, tough climb back to relevance
is almost over. All that’s left is the last little
hill. I

coachjamie Dixon said. “We’ve got to contain

their big guys.”

South Florida senior center Augustus Gil-
christ and sophomore forward Victor Rudd
lead the Bulls’ front line, but the team’s real

strength comes in its depth. Nine active play- A

ers average more than 15 minutes per game
for the balanced Bulls. .
However, with Gilchrist the only player
on the team averaging more than 10 points
per game, a lack of a go—to scorer has plagued
South Florida’soffense this season. The Bulls‘
have failed to break the 50-point barrier in
seven games and lost all of those contests. '

Patterson said he believes the game could ‘ '

be a hard—fought defensive struggle, but he
said that’s not something the Panthers are
afraid of. .
“It’s going to be a challenge. But we’re
tough, and it’s nothing we’ll back down

. from,” he said.

With both teams boasting impressive re-
bounding margins, Dixon also said that the
battle on the boards will be a crucial part of
Wednesday night’s matchup.

“They’ve been playing really well and
playing to their strengths. We’ve got to go in
and hurt them on the glass,” he said. “They’re
a good rebounding team, but I think we can

do some things and take good shots to allow p

us to get in good rebounding positions.”

South Florida will gain an advantage from
playing on its home ﬂoor. .

The Bulls have played their best basketball
this season on their court, recording an 11-1
record. Pitt is just 1-4 away from the Petersen
Events Center in conference play, but that
lone win came on the Panthers’ most recent
road trip to West Virginia.

Patterson said that victory in Morgan-
town has given Pitt renewed conﬁdence in
its ability to win on the road.

“Going down there to get a win in that

A hostile environment showed a lot of tough-

ness from us,” he said.

Taylor said he believes every game for
Pitt is a must—win and that it’s important
for the Panthers to keep building on their
winning streak.

5‘We started over, and now we’re 4-0. And’
we want to build on that,” Taylor said. ﬂ

  

ond with 9.800 scores.

While the freshmen are producing high
scores, Talucci said that senior leadership
and experience will also remain a factor as
the team goes forward.

“All of our seniors have had unique experi-
ences,” Talucci said. “I’ve been to regionals
twice, and Amy and Kelsey [Ainsworth] both
sat out from surgeries and came back to be
very successful. We have come back from
adversity, and that is a great example for

    

our underclassmen as they grow into great V

   
 

competitors.”

With the quad meet victory, the Panthers
responded to several challenges set forth by
their coach.

- “Three goals for us in this meet were to
get rid of falls on the bars, get improvements
from each gymnast and even our record in
the EAGL,” Yohman said. “Check, check and
check.” '

’ The Panthers will look to build on their
ﬁrst victory when they travel to Michigan
State next Saturday.

The Spartans, who compete in the Big Ten
conference, have won their last two meets.
Pitt will return to the Fitzgerald Field House
on Feb. 18 for another nonconference meet
against Bowling Green.
