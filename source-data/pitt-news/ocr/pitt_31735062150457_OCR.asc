A plea, “to go deeper tluni
c.onte1nporar_v eve.nt.s—-to envi-
sion the world of the future.
along with the secminglv "invis-
ible ‘S[)ll'l.llil'a.l drives to today”
was given by Dr. T. Z. Koo,
travelling secretary for the World
Student Christian federation, when
he spoke in Foster memorial Mon-
day afternoon. ‘

Dr. Koo’s talk was the start of

the World Student Service fund
campaigntfor $2,000 campus quota.

Intangible Conﬂicts

Dr. Koo told of his travels in the
far East, and of the intangible con-
flicts he‘ saw there, struggles of spir-
it, which he said “will in the futurr
be far more signiﬁcant that the cur-
rent wars of today.”

“In India,’’ Dr. Koo continued, “I
saw the beginning of one of the
most signiﬁcant trends produced by
our age—non-violence, the belief
that truth is more potent than phys-
ical might. After the guns have
ceased ﬁring and the last bomb has
been dropped, the world may Some
day heed India’s message of non-
violence.”

Ghandi Inﬂuence

Telling of his visit with Mahat-
ma Ghandi, leader of the national-
ist movement in India, Dr. Koo said,
“This little man, living in a small
village in India, issui.ng his orders
from a tiny house, has inﬁnitely
more authority over his followers
than have the British officials, with
their richly decorated, stately look-
ing government buildings, and bla-
zoned. military trappings. It is the
power and vitality of the spirit of
Ghandi, invisible to be sure, but
felt throughout India, that gives
him the unquestionable faith. of his
people.”

Basic Struggle

Another example of the invisible
conflict taking place throughout the
world today is in China, accord-
ing to Dr. Koo, where, he declared,
the basic struggle there is not one
of arms, but one of cultures—the
mil.itarism of Japan, as against the
highly paciﬁstic culture of the Chi-
ncse.

“War to the Chinese is indefensi-
ble, and we ﬁght only because we
have been forced to do so,” Dr. K00
told his audience, “even though the
Chinese policy of today is ‘Resist!
Fight! Build the Nation.’ ”

Ancient Culture

China is not lnterezted in military
activities as deﬁned by the terms
ﬁght and resist, the speaker explain-
ed, since they pertain to resistance
of anything which would break up
her ancient culture. By “Build up
the nation,” the government does not
only mean the physical reconstruc-
tion of buildings and cities, but
rather to carrying on the processes
of education, of international trade,
and of religion which are being
threatened by this war.

“The loss of education is felt far
more keenly by my countrymen
than the loss of territory,” Dr. Koo
declared. ‘‘'.'.'and the sometimes exag-
gerated respect for education on the
part of the Chinese has caused

WSSF Conimitztee ll/leml.)ers
Ailllounce Initial Contrilnltions

First contributions to the Pitt World Student Service fund cam-
paign, $352.40, was collected at the dinner meeting of the WSSF com-
mittee Wednesday evening at the First B:—zpi'ist church, Bayard and Belle-

ﬁeld streets.

An average contribution of $2.25 was given by the 150 committee

members who attended the meet-
ing.

Dr. T. Z. Koo, traveling secre-
tary for the World’s Student Chris-
tian federation, spoke to the com-
mittee, of which Hulda Tully, C41,
is chairman.

Discussion during the meeting
centered on mechanics of organiza-
tion‘ of the group, although the con-
tribution -campaign and distribution
of the fund also were important
topics.

Majority of the group favored
impartial distribution of the funds
for intellectual, social, and moral
improvement of students suffering
because of the war, regardless of
race or creed.

Questions were raised by a few
committeemen concerning aid for
German students because the mem-
bers believed that the funds and
equipment would not be used for
the designated purposes.

Dr. Koo answered these ques-
tions, pointing out that the German
government favored and honored
funds for improvement of students.
According to Dr. Koo, the Germans
only feed the students, and supplies
from outside of Germany boost the
morale of those aided.

Hal Viehman, assistant secretary
of the YMCA, led the discussion on
the contributions, and William
Hammaker, executive secretary of
the YMCA, spoke on the mechanics
olf Pitt WSSF organization.

Hospitalization

payment deadline is Friday, an-
nounces Dr. H. Clifford Carlson,
director of the Men’s Student Health
service. The fee of $2.50 for the
semester must be paid in 7 State
hall on or before Friday.

M achesncy Seeks Odd People,
Odd H obbics - -  Puts ’em on Air

One of the most interesting avo-
faculty
members to while away their “idle”
moments belongs to Robert C. Ma-
chesney, adviser to student publi-
cations and instructor in journal-
ism, whose sideline is scouting out
eccentric people for the popular Co-
lumbia network radio program, “We
the People.”

Machesney is one of six scouts
throughout the country who leaf
through magazines and newspapers
in the search for folks with queer
occupations and unusual experi-
ences to put on the air. It is also
part of his job to make arrange-
ments ior those people to go to New
York city for the broadcast and to
write the script for the program.

Within the next two weeks, two
of Bobs latest “ﬁnds” will be fea-
tured on the program. The ﬁrst is
a West Virginia doctor’s wife who,
after raising ﬁve children, went
back to school and graduated from
the University of West Virginia
medical school.

The second is a recently natural-
ized citizen from East Liverpool,
Ohio, who was arrested for park-
ing. Upon being ﬁned in traﬂic
court, the man observed that he
would be glad to pay the penalty
and then asked that since there was
no American flag in the courtroom.
that he be allowed to give $5 toward
the purchase of one.

The judge immediately reversed
the decision, and Mr. Machesncy
had a hero instead of a petty law-
breaker.

Among the many guests Maches-
ney has sent to the program are two
Alaskans: Governor John Troy,
head of the government’s resettle-
ment project in Matanuska, Alas-
ka, for dust bowl refugees; and
“mercy ﬂier” Joe Crosson who, at
15 degrees below zero, ﬂew serum
to Nome, Alaska, to stop a typhoid
epidemic.

The program, under the direction
of commentator Gabriel Heatter,
goes on the air every Tuesday eve-
ning at 9 o'clock.

Seniors Must
Remove ‘Us’

Before April

Seniors expecting to graduate
{tom the College in June must take
account of a new regulation recent-
ly adopted by the faculty of the Col-
lege, announces Dr. Stanton C.
Crawford, dean of the College.

No incomplete “G” grade incur-
red prior to April 1 will be removed
for seniors after that date. This
means that any “G” grade incurred
in a prior semester, including the
lust Femestei‘ of the current year,
must be removed by the end of
March, if those credits are to be
counted toward graduation.

Failure to remove the incomplete
gimdes by that date will mean that
either such credits must be offset
by additional credits completed
this semester or the graduation must
be de’erred until sufficient credits
for graduation have been earned.

A similar rule will apply to stu-
dents expecting to graduate in Au-
gust. All incomplete grades in
these cases must be removed not
later than the end of May. For
students expecting to graduate in
February of next year, all incom-
glcte grades must be removed
by the end of November. Respon-
3~'ibi.lii.y for the removal of these
gracles rests upon the students con-
cerned, explained Dr. Crawford.

In order to remove a “G” grade
the student should see the instruc-
tor concerned and arrange to com-
plete the work remaining to be
done.

Barton to Address
Pitt NY A Students

“An NYA Employer Speaks” will
be the subject of a lecture to be
given to NYA students by J. Clyde
Barton, purchasing agent for the
University, tomorrow afternoon
from 3:30 to 5 o'clock in 232 Ca-
thedral.

Mr. Barton’s information has
been compiled from statistic sheets
sent to all NYA employers in the
school and evaluated by the office
of the dean of women.

The conference is being sponsored
by the Employment Council of
WSGA under the chairmanship of
Lois Neundorf, Ed43, who urges all
NYA students, both men and wo-
men, to be present.

‘You Pay,’ Mortar Boards Tell
ODK Men in Dinner lnvitation

It isn’t always the woman who
pays.

At least that's the way it looks
from the invitation sent by Mortar
Board, national honorary activities
fraternity for senior women, to Om-
icron Delta Kappa. the same thing
for senior men.

The boys were sitting around the
table at the last ODK meeting.
thinking how wonderful New Or-
leans nzust be. when a letter was
handed to Ruggero Aldisert, C41,
president of the honorary.

“We Mortar Boards.” the letter
stated, “request the pleasure of the
attendance of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, at dinner Tuesday, February
25. 1941. Dinner will be served at
Heinz house at 5:45 o’clock.”

The invitation received a favor-
able reaction, and the boys leaned

back in their chairs, thinking how
wonderful Heinz house must be.

But the rest of the letter did not
meet with such a happy response.

“Because of the condition of the
treasury, we must ask that this bc
a ‘Dutch treat'——the cost will not
exceed 35 cents. Hope you under-
stand.”

Somebody ventured to wonder
just how much food could be served
at a maximum cost of  cents per
plate. A

A question was then iaiscd about
the condition of ODK's treasury.
and the general survey seemed to
indicate that the boys weren’t.

gests Joseph Roberts BA41, pres-
ident of SFA.

Other questions on the list which
also received high percentages were
those concerning the percentage of
student education costs which comes
from appropriations, endowments,
and union; future of fraternities at
Pitt; future plans for the construc-
tion of dormitories on campus; and
increase of student activity funds.
Questionnaire Topics

The questionnaire circulated by

They were listed under the gen-
eral headings of ﬁnance, housing

Tire Neaw Reseﬁilenientg
Hysteria: Repeats Itself

 I-I.-KVE RISER’ LOOKING through the
early l9l'i cop—-ies of The Pitt Weekly Our mood
is one of sad retrospect.

The meat of discussion in those days was the

probicin of post—war Europe. Debates, dinner
ieetings, roundtable conferences, all featured
pertinent and liveljg haranguing as to what
should be done with Europe once the Kaiser’s
troops were sent scuttling back into Prussia.

Or, what was to be done in the event that
the Allies went under the yoke of‘Gcrman’s
“blood and iron” ideology.

Then, as now (‘:’)_, America playedthe role of
curbstone coach, sideline spectator reviewing
each move upon the chessboard of stricken
France.

Some few months later, we were marching.

We were never of the breed who condemn a
thing because it is trite or uninteresting or be-
cause it has been discussed the night before.

We feel that now, as much as before, there is
a need to discuss the resettlement of a post-war
continent, possibly of a post-war world.

A Nazi victory, we feel, can result in none
but a vengeful peace.

‘Nor do we believe that a British triumph af-
fords the solution of an equitable system of re-
allotment. Every bomb that maims an English
child, or blinds an old man, or destroys a mother
with child, removes one step further from
achievement the possibility of a rational unemo-
tional armistice.

We may march again. That is a risk we must
take; This fact remains: we cannot dismiss the
problem with a shrug of the shoulder and a turn-
ing away of the back. We cannot say, this is
none of our business: we did not participate in
the war, we need not be entangled with the
peace.

We are as yet uncertain as to whether or not
we are prepared for war. It is conspicuously evi-
dent, nevertheless, that we are in no way pre-
pared for peace.

Foster Hangs Out
S. R. 0. Signs

AT 1:30 MONDAY afternoon, there were
only 26 empty seats out of the 689 in Foster Me-
morial auditorium.

Under any other circumstances, those 663 ﬁll-
ed; seats would have proved nothing. In this
case, we think the near-capacity attendance es-
tablished deﬁnitely one contention which we
have long held.

University students are interested in speakers
of the calibre of Robinson Jeffers. The reac-
tions to his musings, the repercussions to his
opining, were varied and often opposing. There
were 663 separate and distinct attitudes.

.The fact remains, nevertheless, that there
were reactions and repercussions and varying at-
titudes. There was, in general, a healthy re-
sponse stimulus situation between speaker and
listener.

The students have done their share. They
have given indication of what they want to hear.
It remains now for the administration to pick up
the cue.

You’ve heard them whisper more than once that ignor-

"Lacy say you don’t start living till you smoke and drink

You’ve got to know the answers and you’ve got to kid
the fellas,
And talk on Botticelli and the loves of Havelock Ellis.
So I’ve no charm, all right! and so I’m (leader than a

I’m a throwback, I’m old-fashioned, I’m a nineteenth
century frail,
I haven’t read Ulysses and I drink my cocoa plain,
I don’t like Jimmy Stewart’s lip, there’s mildew on my
brain.
You can laugh and shun,
But half the fun,
Is hearing the others talk,
I can’t rejoice,
At the chant of my voice,
I keep my tongue in hock.
I don’t speak English perfect, I’m a failure at Mah Jong,
I don’t think I'd look ravishing in a polka-dot sarong,
Masculine hats don’t ﬁnd my head, I don’t adjust the
lighting,
I never comment on the war, for I don’t know who’s

I don’t think Mr. Willkie could have done a better job,
I don’t “cat” about my sisters, and their boy friends I

A Smoky Suggestion
To Aid WSSF
Editor, the Pitt News:

This WSSF Be it noted
herein that neither of us have back-
ed any fund to go to Europe until
this time. Be it also noted that
this prison-fund for imprisoned stu-
dents is world-wide and non-parti-
san. We are not idealists. We do
not believe that Germans are “mad-
dogs” or that the English are the
“Guardian Angels Of America” or
vice versa.

We do believe, that from our as-
sociation with people here in the
United States, that men are men,
regardless of race, color or creed.
We have a comradeship with the
student wherever he is, whether in
China, Japan, England, "Germany,
France, Italy, or Greece. To use a
trite phrase: “We are all brothers
under theskin.”

O Cigarettes, Books, Etc.

Students suddenly deprived’ of
cigarettes, books, comforts, minor
luxuries, and in some cases, down-
right necessities, are in one helluva
spot! It’s up to us, here in the U.
S., to see that these men get what
we would not refuse to the Bum On
The Street-Corner.

After all, $2,000 is not too much
to expect from a University with
an enrollment of over four thousand
students. We have three days left
in which to reach this goal. From
observation, we would say that the
average student smokes at least one
pack of cigarettes a day. If we all
gave up cigarettes for the next three
days, it would amount to 48 cents
per student.

0 A Cigarette Between Friends

If you like your smokes too well
to give them up, it is but one more
argument in favor of contribution.
If you cannot give up cigarettes for
three days, think how the boys
over there feel without anything to
smoke at all. We do not mean to
harp on cigarettes, for cigarettes are
the most minute need in the present
situation, but this is one way to raise
money. That is putting it as straight
as we know how.

Life is a lousy play, but you have
a ticket to it and you can’t get your
money back, and even if you could
you wouldn’t know where to go
anyhow . . but life in a prison-
camp is lousier.

Editor, the Pitt News:

‘As I read the report of the inter-
view with me in the News last Fri-
day, it seems to me that it does
not give a correct picture of my 1m-

the hardships caused in England by
the war, but it leaves out an ac-
count of the courage and endurance
with which the British cheerfully
carry on in spite of all the rationing
and bombing. '

This is like describing the hard
punches taken in by Joe Louis.
without adding that he took them
with a smile and was left ﬁt enough
to knock the other fellow out in the

I should also like to say that no

GEORGE GIBIAN, C4-fl,

Editor’s Note: We gratefully
acknowledge Mr. Gibian’s interest-
ing addition to our interview with
him. But to his criticism that we
failed to draw a correct picture of
England from the interview, we
disagree. In our interviews we
stressed the hardships of the Eng-
lzsh people, it is true. But implicit
in the report of these hardships
were the courage and the endurance
0f_th€ Eﬂglish people. More than
this would be mere propaganda and
a repetition of what has long since
become a byword.

It is possible that our reporter
misinterpreted Mr. Gibian with ref-

episode. For this we apologize.

Humanization of the Supreme Court

0 By Gerald Ziskind

In the surge oi’ world events, few people pay heed
to the most signiﬁcant political revolution of our time.
The Supreme court of the United States, with in-
creasing tenacity, rips away outmoded precedent and
clears the path for social legislation heretofore called
blasphemous. Even more noteworthy, our entire fed-
eral judiciary has been reviviﬁed by infusion of new
blood, for President Roosevelt, surpassing any pre-
vious administration, has had occasion to appoint over
95 federal court judges.

What has this meant for our system of govern-
ment‘? As innumerable court decisions indicate, it has
meant the humanizing of our American system. By
the extension of liberal laws, the protection of weaker
minority groups has been assured. The admi'nistra—
tion of law has been equalized for weak and strong
alike. No longer is it the “free prerogative” of the
rich man or beggar to sleep on the park bench. No
longer are the courts a place of refuge for arrogant
and despotic employers. The injunction is no longer
the legal tool of strike breakers, now it has become
the defensive weapon of the worker and employer
against infractions of fair play.

The “Rights” of Labor

The Supreme court has ﬁnally leveled the barrier
to wage and hour legislation, by refusing to defend the
“right” of labor to toil unendurable hours at ten cents
an hour wages. Interstate commerce has been con-
strued to involve all matters touching on the national
welfare, with the consequence that child labor legis-
lation, health and medical—aid programs, and housing
reform merely require congressional enactment. In-
stead of adjuring the American people to perform the
well-nigh impossible task of adopting constitutional
amendments, the present court, in contrast to its pre-
decessor, joins the onward march for human progress.

The record of Justice Black, derided at first because
of his association with the Ku Klux Klan, has been
resoundingly vindicated. His diligent defense of civil
liberties a-nd protection of defenseless minorities should
serve as a model of fair-mindedness.

Prophets of Doom

Some of our prophets of doom, together with cer-
tain die—hards on the Supreme court bench, early pre-
dicted the collapse of constitutional government if we
allowed these developments to transpire. I wonder
if these boys were not talking through their top hats.
Justice McReynolds pounded the rostrum, declaring
that the death knell of free American government had
sounded. Sonorous constitution lawyers like Davis,
Burke, ard Reed cried de-ﬁance in the face of New
Deal legislation, terming it “invalid” before the courts
themselves could decide. “Elder statesmen” moaning
at the bar, swept many of our people into an orgy of
letter—writing and protestation. But the reforms we
sought are here, and nothing dreadful has happened.
Instead, our government has become an articulate
spokesman for the people’s will-—-a defender of indi-
vidual dignity and social welfare, a flexible instrument
keyed to the needs of the hour.

The moral of this episode is simple: Don’t take the
calamity howlers too seriously. Although these ob-
structionists believe their views to be sacrosanct and
indispensable, they strut their brief hour and are
eventually pulverized by the inexorable forces of so-
cial progress.

“7»zom z‘/ze Sialelmat

by Hill J11-.Elu?a.in
Sports Editor

 

Shortly after Dr. Carlson brought his basketball boys back
from their mid-western trip we said that while the Panthers had

i i looked awfully good against Big Ten teaiiis, we were going to wait

a while before we passed ﬁnal judgment.

We have waited.

Wewliave decided that the 1941 Pitt basketball team is not only
as good as it appeared to be early in the season, but that it is bet-
ter. In fact, we would be willing to wager that on any given night,
the Panthers could have taken over any team on their schedule.

’ That, one game of, the schedule still remains and that on four
previous nights during the season Pitt has been unable to take over

the opposition is not so pertinent as it might seem.
‘are that the Busy Bees will win tliatﬁnal game from Penn State

The chances

Saturday night, for they have clipped the Lions once this year

already.

The four defeats can be written oﬂ’ on the grounds that Pitt

was well below form those nights.

To back up this contention, we

might point out that Northwestern and Micliigan, both of whom
decisioned the Pittsburgliers, are staggering around in the lower
levels of the Western conference standings, while 'Wisconsin, Illi-
nois, and Ohio State, all of whom the Carlsonites stopped, have
been in or around the Big Ten ’s upper brackets most of the season.

This still leaves the \Vestininster and \Vayiiesbu1'g losses un- -
Anyone who saw the Yellow Jackets run up a 9-0

accounted for.

.}ead in the first quarter will agree that Pitt was several shades worse

-than horrible: in all respects.

\Vestininster is less easy to laugh off

‘because of its imposing record a.!,{'tlll1St other district‘ foes, lint we
still feel that Pitt would win in a rematch.

All of this aiiiouiits to the fact that the present ﬂl'{oiitinui.t.y
Kids can be, and usually have been, one of the slickest outﬁts the

good Dr. Carlson has ever coached.

It also amounts to a refuta-

tion of the theory that Pitt ’s “dc-cinphasis"’ would produce a pro-

foimd recession in all sports.

It‘-Aii1’,t-tlie-Heat-It’-s-the-Stupidity Departnient: Last year a
young man came down from Johnstown to the Cathedral, and de-

eided he likedtlie place.

After attending a few classes he decided

that what this Uiiivcrsity needed was a riﬂe team; no large school,
he decided, should be without one.

So he talked to some people about it, and they liked the idea.
He ﬁnally went to the dean of men’s oﬂice, was encouraged, got
pjermission to start the team, got a faculty adviser, and in fact had

everything he needed but riﬂes.

He went to the Military departnient for those. There he was

received kindly but his mission failed.

Apparently unknown to all

the people he had previously approached was that the University
has a riﬂe team and has had for several years: the Military depart-
ment sponsors it. VVhicli only goes to prove that for some people

at least, this school is just too large.

Followers of coach Carl Olson's

once between now and summer, but they can console tliemselves
with the thought that Pitt will have lost’ to some of the best track
teams in the country. Possibly to all of them. I

Panther S pihed-Shoe Brigade
Seeks ICAAAA Indoor Togo

The University of Pittsburgh
track team will attempt to add the
ICAAAA indoor title to the out-
door title they won last June when
they travel to Madison Square gar-
den Saturday night.

Although defeated in their ﬁrst
team performance last Saturday
night, the Panther spiked—shoe
brigade showed enough strength to
make their position extremely
hopeful this Saturday. The Panthers
captured as many ﬁrst places as did
the Wolverines, and everyone of
those ﬁrst place men is capable of
a top—notch performance in severe
competition.

Stitfest opposition will come from
NYU, Fordham, Penn State, and
Manhattan. New York U has Les
MacMitchell; Fordham has a crack
mile-relay foursome; Penn State
has Barney Ewell; and Manhattan
has Andy Neiding and Johnny
Quigley.

Coach Carl Olson’s outﬁt lacks a
name that occupies as high a place
in track circles as a MacMtichell,
but the locals have as much individ-
ual brilliance and beter chance than
any of the ﬁve squads listed. Even
the “Little King” himself is con-
ﬁdent of his team’s chances, and
usually Olson sees nothing but the
darkest of prospects for his charges.

To begin with, no team in the
country has two sprinters of the
calibre of Hap Stickel and Bill

‘Carter, and a sprinter of a mem-

ber team in the ICAAAA has yet
to beat either of these famous
sprint twins. Unless Barney Ewell,

Penn State star, demonstrates a
sudden reversal of form, even he
may not ﬁnish ahead of these two.
In any event, they should do no
worse than second and third.

Carter ﬁnished second to Harold
Davis, in the Millrose 60-yard
the sprirt, and won at the NYAC
games. Stickel placed third in the
latter and ﬁnished in ﬁrst place
ahead of Carter at Michigan last
Saturday. Last year Carter ﬁnished
second in the ICAAAA indoor 60,
and Stickel ﬁfiished second in the
outdoor 100. In both meets Ewell
was the victor. Saturday may tell 2.
different story.

Another junior pair, Dusty
Rhoades and Red Jessup, occupy
a similar place in the spotlight.
Both cleared 13 feet 6 inches at
Ann Arbor last Friday night, and
on the basis of these performances
must be rated at least second and
third Saturday. A less conservative
estimate would place them in the
ﬁrst two slots, since no one in the
East has soared beyond 13 feet.

Del Anderson, the senior half-
miler, scored the most impressive
victory of his career against Michi-
gan with his 1256.5 performance
and is in a good spot to win the 600
at New York. He should at least
get third. Other almost certain
place winners are Bill Benghouser,
who hurled the 16-pound shot over
47 feet but fouled Friday night;
Zeke Sterner, the senior distance
star, who turned in a 9:42.9 two
mile; Carter in the broad jump, and
Dave McPoWe1l, high jumper.

Diploniats Sink
Pitt S‘<Wl!llIn€3.‘S
in Close Battle

Wveaken-ed Gradynien
Await ECSA L‘/leet

Franklin and l\Iarshall‘s mediocre
swimming squad pulled a surprising
41-34 upset over a favored Pitt ‘ig-
gregation last Saturday night at
the F & M home pool.

It was a nip and tuck splash bat-
tleiall the way, with the Diplomats
taking ﬁve events and Pitt capturing
four. Dick Price, the Eastern Col-
legiate star free styler, won both
the 220 and 440-yard races in his
specialty for the Diplomats.

Captain Dick Ames scored the
ﬁrst winning points for the Panth-
ers, as he outclassed the other div-
ers with a 101.1 point performance.
Gus Wilde just missed winning the
50-yard free style race by seconds,
as Diplomatic Gager, ﬁnishing fast,
edged in ahead of him.

Wilde Scores Comeback

But Wilde came back in the 100-
yard free style and Won a decisive
decision over F & M’s Macionis.
Herb Cosgrove ﬁnished ﬁrst in the
200-yard breaststroke race with
Berger and Herr scoring valuable
second and third place points for the
Diplomats.

Victory points for the relay races
were divided, the Lancaster lads
winning the 300-yard medley relay
and the Panther quartet of Wilde,
Al Samson, Cosgrove, and Joe Or-
loff taking the free style relay. Or-
loﬁ took the runner-up spot in two
eﬁénts, ﬁnishing second in both the
220-yard free style and the 150-
yard backstroke battles.

Reserve Swimmers Needed

It was Pitt’s fourth defeat in ﬁve
starts this season. And, as usual,
the Panther downfall can be direct-
ly traced to the lack of reserve
strength. With the exception of
the diving events, the box score
showed only six different Panther
names, proving that coach Ben
Grady’s supply of swimmers is def-
initely limited.

March 7 and 8, the Panthers jour-
ney to Rutgers university for the
annual Eastern Collegiate cham-
pionship tussle. Grady has a little
more than a week to prepare his
swimmers for the all-important
meet, but as things stand at present,

it looks as though the Panthers Will!

no longer have their Eastern Colle-
giate crown when March 9 rolls
around.

C-reek Leaders

Score Victories

None of the fraternity basketball
teams seemed to have suffered from
the month’s lay-off, for all the fa-
vored teams came through in last
Thursday’s games.

The league leading Sammies won
easily from the Pi Lams, 20-13.
White and Coltin lead the victors
with six points apiece.

The Phi Delts, with Robinson and
Young leading the attack and scor-
ing eight points each, defeated The-
ta Chi, 22-13, in a somewhat dull
contest.

The highest scoring contest was
the one in which the Phi Gains de-
feated the Phi Eps, 35-12. Hol-
brook led the Phi Gains with three
ﬁeld goals and three fouls for a
total of nine points.

In volleyball, two games were
played. The Phi Gains beat Kappa
Sigma, 3-0, and the Phi Eps beat
the Pi Lams, 2-1. The Phi Kaps
forfeited to the Delts, and the Sam-
mics and Theta Chis suffered a dou-
ble forfeit.

In table tennis, the Phi Gains de-
feated the Phi Delts, 7-5, the Phi
Eps lost to the Sammies, 8-4, and
the Pi Lams defeated the Kappa
Sigs, 8-4. The league leading Delts

Last year, too,  ._ 
he was a thorn stickei
in the side of the "

Wolverines and was instrumental in -'

stopping a 23-meet win streak with
15 points. He also aided the Pitt
championship cause considerably in
the ICAAAA meet last spring.

He is best known as a member
of the famous Stickel-Carter sprint
combination, but he’s also a great
low hurdler. He never attempted
the obstacle race until last year,
but before the year was over he had
clipped .9 of a second from the Pitt
record with a 23 ﬂat performance
in the 220-yard lows.

Panther Club Holds
Induction Meeting,
Plans for Future

Both old and new members of the
Panther Club will meet today at
1:30 o’clock in 213 Cathedral. Ernie
Bonelli, C41, president of the or-
ganization, especially urges all ac-
tive members to be present. so that
they may greet the newcomers and
make plans for future events.

Nine of the 12 new lettermen in
the club are varsity gridmen, while
three earned letters in track com-
petition. The new members of the
association are: Vincent Antonelli,
Bill Benghauser, John Gates, Al
Gurczenski, Harry Kindelberger,
George Mitchell, Tom Murphy, Jack
Stetler, Walt West, Marcus Allias,
John Brosky, and Bob Davis.

Many important matters are to
be discussed at today’s meeting; and
since a 75 per cent quorum is es-
sential, all members of the club
should attend.

Phi Kappa Opposes Pijis
in Second Place Fight

While the league leading Sammie quintet is

T

ousy brushing off in-

ferior foes, the Fiji-Phi Kap battle for second place toniorrow night on
the Trees gym ﬂoor highlights the second half of the l-F basketball race.

Both teams will be playing with
their backs to the wall, since elim-
ination from the race will be the
result of a loss.

Phi Kappa, with their only loss
credited to the victory-crazy SAM
ﬁve, should go into the fracas as
slight favorites. Their offense is
reputed to be tops in fraternity cir-
cles, and their defense not far from
superior.

Joe Connell, ace shot-maker of
the ex-champions, will be in tip-
top shape for the ﬁrst time in quite
a while, and should be counted upon
to supply ﬁreworks.

Bobby Tyberski, unsung hero of
the Phi Kap combination, has been
playing his usual steady game as
a ball handler and play maker. He
has been overshadowed for the past
two years by his teammates, but
this year he has come into his own.

Phi Gamma Delta’s hopes are
based solely on the ability of Bob-
by ‘Thurbon to hit the hoop. Thur-
bon set a fast pace in early season
games, but lately has seemed to
have lost his accuracy. Al Holbrook,
defensive star of the Fijis, plays a
rugged brand of ball, and will def-
initely be at home in the game with
the Phi Kaps.

Earl Pressel, strong-arm center of
the Wallinglord street house, con-
tributes to the team’s success large-
ly through his ability to retrieve
the ball from the banking boards.

This tilt will start at 9 o’clock
and should be the best contest in
the league for some time to come.

Although hidden by the lustre of
the Fiji-Kap affair, the Phi Delta
Theta basketball game with the
LCA’s should produce some classy
play by the Phi Delts in their bid
for third place.

life. And so each night I am forced to
lose my life. _ _
“Come sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving
Lock me in delight awhile: _
Let some pleasing dreams beguile
All my fancies; that from thence
I may feel an inﬂuence .
All my powers of care bereavin_g!v
Though but a shadow, but a sliding
Let me know some little Joy!”

Jackson, may I have that schedule or
are you a voodooist?

THIS THING HAS GONE TOO

FAR

When even the professors start losing
their prize possessions. Anyhoo, Mr.
Theodore Finney has lost his gold-cased
Gotham watch bearing the initials “TMF.”
Incidentally this watch was given to him
by the University, so its sentimental
value is great. It was lost in the fourth
floor men's room last Friday, so get busy,
chillin’, and ﬁnd the thing for him.

T0 SOMEBODY NICE
The person who found my slide _rule

continued their mastery over the turn it to the lost and tfliiund depa1"t‘r,nent.

Critic Names R. Jcﬁers
‘A Poet of Hisé§Ti.mes’

By ANGELO M. BRUNO

It was Carl Sandburg, who, in an
eﬁort to make contemporary verse
more comprehensible to the average
reader, revived the traditional cus-
tom of the poet reading his own
poetry. Last Monday afternoon in
the Foster memorial, Robinson

"Jeﬁers, one of America’s signiﬁcant

living poets, bowed to the bardic
tradition. 3 »

Judged as a reading, Jeffers’ ap-
pearance can be called unsuccess-
ful; although his voice was warm
and virile, it did little justice to
the rhythms of his verse. For in-
tellectual cerebration, however,
Jeffers’ appearance was highly sat-
isfactory. He had things to say and
he said them easily and with a lack
of pretentiousness. '

Six Themes

J eﬁers revealed himself clearly as
a poet of his time _as he stated the
six themes that have molded his
poetry. This principal theme, con-
templation of death as a release
from pain, is clearly post-war in
its pessimism and general morbid-
ity. This philosophy, if it may be
called that, sees life as a serpent
slowly and monotonously dragging
its length along the ground. There
is no beauty in life except the
beauty of futility and sorrow, and
death is the release of all life’s ills.

The second theme in Jeffcrs’ poe-
try is that of war. The brutal-
ity and injustice of twentieth cen-
tury warfare is seen as a natural
part of living. According to this
philosophy, it is as just for a man
to be killed in war as it is for a
flock of pigeons to be frightened by
a hawk.

Age of Decay

“The worlds as the world is...”

The third, and to me, the most
important theme of Jeifers’ poetry
is the idea of the “culture age.”
This is the idea stated by Spengler
in his “Decline of the West,” al-
though J effers discredits that source
for Giambattista Vico’s more cur-
rently discussed theory. Stated
simply it amounts to this: every civ-
ilization has its rise and fall, and
we are living now in an age of de-
cay, the decay of the greatest and
most complex civilization that has
ever been recorded.

The poet read sections of a long
narrative poem which is to be pub-
lished this fall to illustrate this
idea. An introspective and moody
young man, who might well be J eff-
ers himself, sees life as only an in-
strument of frustration. He has no
God, no religion, and there is noth-
ing in, which he can believe.

“I wish to God I had some reli-
gion. . .
I want the truth, the truth.”

The radio in the background
which pours out baseball scores and
war news is the symbol of a crumb-
ling society that is vicious, intoler-
ant, and inhuman. ;

Although Jeffers has refuted
Christianity. as a religion, he still
has some religious feeling. This he

expresses in an identification of him-
self with the universe, the fourth
theme. The ﬁfth theme is that of
the “self-torturing God,” an indi-
vidual who refutes the basic con-
cepts of good as good, and evil as
evil. Both good and evil are neces-
sary in the experience of the total
man:

“Without the peace, no pleasure in

pain.”

The final theme, which is ahnost a
summary of the others, lauds the
beauty and purity of nature as con-
trasted with the corrupted man.
And here the hawk is a symbol of
the central, puriﬁc force of nature.
The hawk is something good and is
incapable o fevil; man, on the con-
trary, thrives on evil.

“I’d sooner kill a man than a
hawk,” Jeffers says. And the hawk
is almost the incarnation of God,
uniting the poet to the universe
with a clean sweep of wing.

Local Section of ‘Who’s Who’
Includes 68 Faculty Members

The Pittsburgh sectionof “Who’s
Who” reads like the University di-
rectory. Sixty—eight members of
the faculty have been included in
this year’s listing. Six of these are
listed for the first time this year.

These six men include: Dr. Wil-
liam S. McEllroy, dean of the School
of Medicine; Wilber I. Newstetter,
dean of the School of Applied So-

cial Sciences; Leland D. Baldwin,
acting University librarian; H. S.
Coleman, assistant director of Mel-
lon Institute; Dr. W. W. D. Sones,
professor of education; and Dr.
J. Homer McCready of the School
of Medicine.

Dr. Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of wo-
men, is the only woman. faculty
member listed.

Representing the university ad-
ministration are: Dr. John G. Bow-
man, chancellor; Rufus H. Fitzger-
ald, provost; Dr. John Weber, sec-
retary of the Universitty; and Dr.
William R. Farmer, chaaplain.

Seven Deans

Among the deans listed are: Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men;
Dr. Julius A. Koch, emeritus dean.
of the School of Pharmacy; Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford, the College;
Frank W. Shockley, director of the
Extentions; Dr. C. S. Tippetts,
School of Business Administration;
Dr. E. R. Weidlein, director of Mel-
lon Institute; and Elmer A. Hol-
brook, School of Engineering and

your name is “Who’s Who” is to
belong to the staﬁ of the College.
Faculty members of the College
listed include: Dr. Andrey Avinoff;

them to build many of what you
would call refugee—universities."

Describing one of these refugee-
ur-iversities, he said, “Physically
they are not much, just a little mud
and straw, with mud furniture (we
have plenty of mud in my country)
and planks for desks, but it is the in-
tensity of the spirit of the students,
invisible and intangible, that makes
these universities truly remarka-
ble.”

Eastern Trends

The Chinese scholar then pointed
out several trends which have been
in existence in the far east and
which he labelled incompatible to
each other. In describing the pro-
posed “new order” of Japan in
which that country would set up a
closed and subjugated Asia, with
Japan as the duling ‘state, Dr. Koo
said:

“This Japanese plan is in direct
contrast to the open door policy of
the United States, and sooner or
later these two policies will clash
——unless one of them swerves from
the path along which it has been
going. Japan, however, will not
take the first stroke against the
United States, because she knows
that she would be beaten in a war
with America. and so I believe that
she has only been blufﬁng these past
few months in a desperate attempt
to force the United States to devi-
ate from her policy of aiding China.
Asiatic Policy

“When Japan sent her new am-
bassador to the United States, it
marked Japan's last attempt at
blufﬁng that country into swerving
from her present Asiatic policy.
Here again we see a struggle of the
spiritual. of the moral rather than
of the material and physical, and
how your country acts in the next
month or two will give to the world
the key to her spiritual nature.”

Dr. Koo told the audience that
the world which people of today
know is rapidly breaking up; and
that after the present war is over
"a wave of revolution, political and

economic, will sweep over the en-
tire world.”

In an exclusive interview after
his speech, Dr. Koo told Pitt News
reporters, that he expected the na-
ture of these sweeping changes to
be “in the main, socialistic.”

Dr. F. L. Bishop; Dr. Kelvin Burns,
who is also assistant director of Al-
legheny Observatory, Dr. N. An-
drew Cleven, Dr. Manuel C. Elmer,
Dr. M. R. Gabbert, Dr. Percival
Hunt, Dr. Elmer "Hutchisson, Dr.
Charles G. King, Dr. Alexander

Phi Gamma Delta. They are Char-
ley Brossman, Charley Egan, Her-
man Wilhelm, Al McCardle, Cliff
Potter, Jack Reis, Joe Griffiths, Lee
McFadden, Bill Yocum, Howdy
Masquelier, and Dick Quigley. Even
though they went through one of
the Fiji’s most grueling hell weeks,
this group presented the chapter
with a beautiful mantle clock as
an expression of their appreciation
at being taken into the chapter as
actives. That’s what we call the
real spirit.

Physicians Aid
Preparedness

Plans of U. S.

Medical preparedness is a most
important feature of national pre-
paredness, Dr. William S. McEllroy,
dean of the School of Medicine,
states, and in order to be prepared
from a medical standpoint it is es-
sential that we have an adequate
number of well-trained doctors to
care for the Army and civilian pop-
ulation.

“In the light of the present emerg-
ency,” Dr. McEllroy says, “the de-
mand for the services of physicians
is greatly increased. In connection
with our present training program,

from 8,000 to 10,000 additional
physicians will be needed by the
Medical corps of the Army to care
for the medical needs of the young
men drafted for training in camps
under the conscription act.”

These doctors will be taken from
civilian practices, Dr. McEllroy in-
dicates.

“If we should become actively
engaged in war,” he continues, “the
demand on the part of the Army
for additional physicians would be
greatly increased. At the same time,
the experience of European coun-
tries has demonstrated that the care
of civilians may, in addition, be-
come a major medical problem.

“It is a necessary part of any pre-
paredness program that" the medic-
211 schools of the country continue
to graduate the usual number of
physicians,’ Dr. McEllroy believes.
“If the schools continue to operate
and graduate annually at least
5,000, an adequate supply of physic-
ians will be available. In order
to do this, medical students will
have to be given deferment in the
draft, and I believe that this is the
intention of governmental officials
responsible for the selective service
act,” Dr. McEllroy concludes.

William T. Root, dean of the gradu-

Upsilon, honorary chemical society.

Preceding the lecture, the en-
