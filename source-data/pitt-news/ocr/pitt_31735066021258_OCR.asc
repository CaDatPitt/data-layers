Graduating? Finding work can be a job in itself

By Pria Bhargava

The Pitt News

A job search can be long and
frustrating or short and fruitful,
depending upon one’s approach.

The following steps, if followed
carefully, will guarantee a short
road to that first big job, accord-
ing to Robert Nelson, a consul-
tant and writer who specializes in
career—bui|ding and professional
skills, and Pitt University Place-
ment Service Director Robert
Hopkins.

- First of all, according to Nelson
and Hopkins, a job hunter must
know what it is that he or she
wants to do. The search will be
random unless its parameters are

first narrowed down.

Employers want to hire some-
one who is qualified and highly
motivated to do the specific job
they are offering, Nelson and
Hopkins said. Employers prefer to
hire individuals who have select-
ed their company for specific rea-
sons. It is important to an
employer that a job applicant can
explain why he has decided to
seek a particular position, and
why he would enjoy and handle
the position effectively.

Many students approach job
hunting in a passive way, letting
random circumstances control
their fate. Nelson and Hopkins
recommend getting started early
to relieve a lot of pressure, start-

ing in small ways, such as mak-
ing a list of preparatory steps and
making a strong time and energy
commitment.

Most novice job hunters ap-
proach only a few job leads at a
time. Instead, Hopkins and Nel-
son recommend approaching 50
or 75 prospects simultaneously,
using listings from professional
associations, Pitt's placement
service and other sources.

The placement center ”brings
together employers and stu-
dents,” Hopkins said. He sug-
gests that students use the
placement manual and go to the
placement office early to make
full use of the facility. He also
recommends the internship office

on the ninth floor of the
Cathedral of Learning and co-op,
a service available in the en-
gineering school.

”The key is to get experience,
gain an understanding and a track
record of qualifications,” Hop-
kins said. ”Experience is a good
predictor of how you will do in
the future. If you don't have ex-
perience, employers will have to
focus on something that may be
irrelevant. If you have ex-
perience, you can talk with your
employer of your experiences -
what you liked and didn't like,”
he added.

Hopkins pointed out that past
employers can also be used as
references, providing external

validation. Past employers back-
ing up the experiences that a job
hunter has cited gives a prospec-
tive employer confidence in his
abilities, he added.

A job applicant must _”show
evidence of how [he has] dealt
with the politics of a work place,"
Hopkins explained.

View employment from the
employer's perspective, he sug-
gested. Employers are interested
in knowing how an employee
can help them, rather than vice
versa. Therefore, it is important to
focus on the .employer’s objec-
tives, needs and problems — to
understand what they are and to
emphasize correlating aspects of

Dog finds employment with the Heinz Corporation

By Jennifer Moritz
Staff Writer

It was a rags to riches story for
a local shelter dog who was
swept off his paws and into the
spotlight last month by the Heinz
Food Company's search for dogs
to promote a new line of dog
food products.

Despite dog-eat—dog competi-
tion from the thousands of other
dogs in the Pittsburgh communi-
ty, Alex, who was discovered at
the Animal Rescue League in East
Liberty, was one of 20 dogs chos-
en to model for Heinz in a na-
tional ‘advertising campaign.

Alex's road to stardom began
with a phone call to the shelter

from the promotional department
of Heinz Foods, located in the
Pittsburgh area. Heinz asked the
ARL for permission to visit the fa-
cility and view the dogs that were
ready for adoption.

Alex, a stray dog who was
found on the street in the neigh-
borhood of Sheraden, Pa., is ap-
proximately 3 years old and is
part shepherd and part setter,
with black markings. When Alex
was brought to the ARL, the staff
named him after the Stroh’s beer
dog, whom he resembled.

Despite his handsome features
gnd calm temperament, Alex
spent two months in the ARL,
waiting to be adopted. During his
stay, Alex became the favorite pet

of the staff members, and quick-
ly learned the daily routine of the
shelter, according to Judy Tho-
mas, public relations coordinator
for ARL. =
”When the cages were cleaned

_ early in the morning, Alex would

just step out of his cage and right
into his new cage on the other
side of the aisle. He knew exact-
ly what to do and where he was
supposed to go,” said Thomas.

When the Heinz representative
arrived at the ARL to survey the
dogs, several of them caught her
eye. The staff could not resist the
chance to get their favorite pet
into the spotlight, and made cer-
tain to show Alex to the represen-
tative. Heinz agreed to give Alex

a shot at stardom. One other dog
was also chosen from the ARL
and taken to the Heinz studio for
photographing.

While most of the other dogs
chosen for the project became
very noisy, nervous and un-
manageable in front of the
cameras, Alex remained well-
behaved and at ease during the
entire shoot.

”Alex was such a natural in
front of the cameras — he turned
out to be a photographer's
dream,” Thomas said. ”You
couldn't help but notice what a
special dog he was.”

Alex was the first dog that
Heinz photographed that day.
According to Thomas, the pho-

tographers shot five or six rolls of
film of Alex in which he was

‘posed in a variety of ways.

In one series of shots — surely
one of his favorites — Alex was
photographed while eating dog

food from a china plate. Did Alex '

clean his plate? You bet, and he
even had seconds!
Alex is now living happily with

his new owner, the president of

the ARL’s women's auxiliary
group, who adopted Alex short-
ly after the Heinz photographs
were taken.

Alex's fate as a star has yet to
be decided by Heinz.

The ARL is a non-profit organi-
zation that provides shelter and

  -Senate ap

WASHINGTON — The Senate
on Wednesday approved a
record $157 billion bailout and
reform bill for the savings and
loan industry after toughening
provisions that would require
S&L owners to put more of their
own money at risk to stay in
business.

NEWS BRIEFS

The 564-page bill was ap-
proved on a 91-8 vote two
months after President Bush
called for emergency legislation
to stop the hemorrhaging of the
federal S&L insurance fund from
the failure of 500 thrifts, more
than 200 of them in 1988, and
another 350 at or near in-
solvency.

The legislation will be the big-
gest government financial rescue
in history, dwarfing five times
over the combined costs of the
New York City, Penn Central,
Chrysler and Lockheed bailouts
of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Similar S&L legislation is mov-

proves savings and loan bailout

ing through the House but at a
slower pace. Final congressional
action is expected before July.

Bush, Hussein agree
to work for peace
WASHINGTON — President

. Bush and Jordan's King Hussein

agreed Wednesday to strive for
”a serious negotiating process”
for Middle East peace, and the
United States said the monarch
did not reject an Israeli proposal

for Palestinian elections in the -

West Bank and Gaza strip.

After the two leaders talked for

more than an hour at the White
House, the administration ex-
pressed satisfaction over Hus-
sein’s statment to Bush that ’’I
fully support you and all your
efforts.”

Hussein's visit marked the end
of the first round of Middle East
diplomacy for Bush, following
talks earlier this month with
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.

Administration wants
porn-line law upheld

WASHINGTON — The Bush
administration urged the
Supreme Court on Wednesday to
protect the nation's children by
upholding a federal law that
would shut down the $2 billion
”dial-a-porn” industry.

Congress was justified when it
passed a law last year banning all
sexually explicit telephone dial-

up message services to ”protect.

children from hearing patently
offensive speech,” Justice Depart-
ment lawyer Richard Taranto
contended.

But Harvard law professor
Laurence Tribe, representing a
major purveyor of dial-a-porn
services, said Congress went too
far.

Saying most attempts by chil-
dren to reach the 976.numbers
used by dial-a-porn companies

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 20, I989

can be frustrated by technologi-
cal safeguards, Tribe said, ”Their
availability makes this flat ban
illegitimate.”

Freshman shoots
himself accidentally

GROVE CITY, Pa. — Grove
City College officials said a fresh-
man with a .22-caliber semi-
automatic pistol apparently shot.
himself accidentally in a dormi-
tory room Wednesday.

Matthew A. Amend, a business
administration major from Car-
negie, was playing with his pistol
in_ a Ketler Dormitory room of
friends at 1:22_ p.m. when the
weapon apparently discharged
unexpectedly, according to col-
lege spokesman Bob Smith.

Amend was wounded in the
head, Smith said.

College officials rushed Amend
to United Community College in
Grove City. He was then flown

by helicopter to Allegheny‘

General Hospital in Pittsburgh,
where his condition was not im-
mediately known, Smith said. '

Pitt med school student looks forward to healing

By Keely S. Ramirez

ForTheIﬁﬂlVeMs

”I’d like to be the kind of doc-
tor who has to drive five miles to
get to the patient and be able to
help him, even if he can't afford
to pay me right then and there,”
says ”Thomas,” a Pitt student in
his thirdyear of medical school.

Thomas’ dreams do not consist
of a Mercedes and an elaborate
home with tennis courts and a
swimming pool. His dream is to
practice medicine on an Indian
reservation.

Thomas says that, unlike many
of his peers, he plans on becom-

ing a general practitioner in one
of the areas where doctors are
needed most.

But Thomas remembers a time
when he had a chip on his shoul-
der and a distrustful view of life.

”There was a time in my life
when I had lost faith in people's
ability to be caring for one
another,” he says.

When Thomas was 12, his fa-
mily moved from Philadelphia to
a small, coal-mining town in the
South.

”The name of the town was
Pikesville and it had a population
of about 5,000,” Thomas recalls.
”And the people of Pikesville

were not trusting of any outsiders
and discriminated against people
who weren't originally from the
town.”

Thomas’ family moved to
Pikesville, Ky., because his father
had received a better teaching
position there.

”I had moved about 13 times
in my life and never had I ex-
perienced prejudiced people be-
fore. Up until then, I had believed
in the merit of most individuals,”
Thomas says.

Playing basketball in an empty
gym, Thomas was confronted by
a group of teenage boys who
repeatedly harassed him.

”Just as I was starting to shoot
some baskets, in walk five 16- or
17-year-old boys who started
picking on me because I was
from the North,” he says. ”They
also wanted my basketball, and
when I wouldn't give it to them,
one kid grabbed it and hit me in
the head with it. I must have
snapped, because I got my
basketball back and hit one of
them in the head with it.”

At this point, Thomas says, the
group of boys forced him into an
unoccupied weight room. They
assaulted him and tied his arms
and legs to a universal weight set
with surgical tape. Then, ‘they

weighton his chest, stomach and
genitals.

Thomas was saved by a secu-

rity guard who checked the"

weight room periodically.

”I was lucky I wasn't ruptured
or had internal bleeding,” says
Thomas. ”But what I was afraid
of most was what my father might
do. I knew whatever he did, it
was going to make things harder
on me in the long run.”

Thomas’ father filed an assault
and battery suit against the boys,

who received detention in school A

and a few years probation.

THE PITT NEWS

A few

Well, here it is. TE.=)|ast one.
Four years spent at Pitt, and it
seems like I have spent my whole

_ life at The Pitt News.

Over the years, I have seen a
lot of different things go on. I
have offended some with a

'column or two. The biggest thing

I learned was that Pitt students
have a hard time taking a joke.
Everything is taken just a little
too personally. But, hey, that's
the way it goes. If I didn't offend
you, then you were left out.
All in all, Pitt has been good to
me. I learned a lot (believe it or
not), and I think I have furthered
myself in many different ways.
Pitt is a fun place, but remember,
you have to make it fun. Nobody
can do that for you. So now, with
my last column to ever appear in
The Pitt News, I will hopefully
make everyone mad once more.
Here are a few things I can
honestly say that I will not miss
when I leave the Ivy League of
Western Pennsylvania:

Good bye

In less than two weeks, I will
be born again.

I've ordered my ceremonial
cap and gown, filled out the
necessary forms and made reser-
vations for family members at the
local Holiday Inn. The time has
come. My four-year incubation
period in the sheltered womb of
Pitt is complete. I await delivery.
On April 30, I will graduate.

Graduation Day will be sunny
and warm. I'll wake up bright and
early and indulge in a delicious
breakfast of eggs, toast, muffins,
orange juice and milk. Next, an
early happy hour with friends,
where we'll drink champagne,
toast to each others’ success and
promise to remain close. At
noon, I'll meet my proud family
Downtown for an elegant lunch
and an inspirational father-to-son
pep talk.

After lunch, my fellow gradua-
dates and I will gather in the

The first logical step is to find

its flavor, produce a big bubble
of work and be applauded.
However, what happens when
someone bursts your bubble?
When the flavor dries up? What
if you can't just spit out a job and
find a fresh one? I suppose you
swallow it, regardless of. the

damage it may cause to your-

health.

I've paged through career ad-
vertisements and mailed a few
letters of inquiry. However, I still

On the whole, things haven't

Love is sometimes a less—than-rewarding experience

As I was walking on Pitt cam-
pus the other day, I came across
a young man lying on the street,
semi—conscious. There was an
almost-empty 40-ounce bottle of
Shlitz malt liquor lying next to
him. My first thought was, of
course, "Oh look, someone from
the Liquor Control Board.” My

MARK
STAF

second thought, however, was of
a friend named Steve.

The reason I thought of my old
friend was because the two of us
hung out quite often, and we al-
ways drank those 40-ounce bot-
tles of Shlitz malt liquor. As a
matter of fact, the last time that
I had seen mon ami Steve was the
last time that I had savored the
‘flavor of this raunchy booze. I
remember it well...

It was last spring, almost a year
ago. We drank four of those bot-

    

tles. Steve, in a stupor; told me

   

how he and this girl were so in
love, and how he wanted to live
the rest of his life with her, and
how they were going to get an

apartment together, and how‘

they were going to get married
someday, and how, and how,
and how...

Steve was pretty ripped, so I
didn't think much about the
speech that he had given me. It
wasn't until about a month later,
when he called me and asked me
to help him move his stuff from
his apartment to hers, that I took
him seriously. Since then, our
friendship had just sort of
evaporated...

I was now only a few steps
away from this drunkard on the
street. As he lifted his head and
looked at me, I realized that this
was... this was... just some drunk
guy. You thought I-was going to
say, ''I realized that it was my
long-lost friend Steve.” ‘Well,
you're wrong, so Ha Ha. And
stop trying to predict my col-
lumns‘,rdamn_ it. I g ’

.V ioutof. herey'es."' , 

I got back to m.y_apartment and
gave Steve a call. Coincidentally,
he had broken up with his girl-
friend, and was now living back
in Oakland and rooming with
Wesley Posvar.

Steve and I had a long talk
about the young lady whom he
affectionately refers to as "the
girlfiend from hell.''

To this day, Steve swears that
she was possessed. "It was the
strangest thing," Steve told me. '’I
would come home after class and
she would just be sitting there on
the couch, holding a shotgun,
talking backwards. 'evetS, yad
ruoy saw woH?' she would ask.

"I tried to accept the changes
that she was going through,"
Steve said, tears forming in his
eyes. "But when she carved 666
onto her forehead and randomly

cut me open to drink my blood,‘

I just couldn't take it. She'd get
mad about the littlest things.

I couldn't give him the solu-
tions to his problems, but I did

recommend him to the family _
. psychiatrist that has helped me

and so many of my relatives. _

Steve's problems are not the
only ones that I have seen recent-
ly. Just this spring, I can think of
a lot of relationships -that have
ended. Many of my friends have
gone through breakups. My girl-
friend and I have parted. Heck,
even my goldfish and I are hav-
ing problems.

There is definitely a pattern
here: people meet in the late
summer or early fall and break up
in the spring. There is a reason for
the’ pattern, one which I have
figured out and am now ‘follow-
ing myself. ‘ '

A student thinks, "There is no '

way in hell I'm studying for or
passing these finals. I know, I'll

\ break up with my boyfriend/gir|-

friend, and I'll be so depressed

that I'll have to go out every n.igh_t ,

and drink like at hog:;».Conseq;uen_‘ ‘

., ., ,

  
  
   
 

and Dad will feel so bad for me
and be so worried, that they'll
send me somewhere for the
summer."

It really works. Steve and I are
on our way to New York for the
summer, all expenses paid, to
"get our lives back together.” We
already have girlfriends lined up
for finals in the fall and Christmas

I breaks.

A better approach to
dealing with murder

While New York courts founder, delivering verdicts of mans-
laughter and sentences of five years probation to violent murderers,
a Florida jury has delivered a verdict that is much more appropri- ‘
ate to the crime, one that shows a greater understanding of the
seriousness of an innocent individual’s death. A Christian Scien-
tist couple who allowed their 7-year-old daughter to die by de-
pending on faith healers have been found guilty of third-degree

murder and child abuse.

-The Hermansons were supposedly devout Christian Scientists
whose religious beliefs relied on prayer and spiritual practioners
instead of medical treatment. Their daughter, who was a victim
of diabetes, died because her parents would not obtain conven-
tional medical treatment for her, even though they had both sought
medical treatment for themselves in the past.

The prosecutors contended that the case was not about the par-
ents’ right to practice their religion, but about the child’_s‘rights
asa human individual. The jury upheld this opinion. The Herman-
sons now face three to seven years in prison.

The choice of religion is, of course, an individual’s right. But
individuals have no right to deny treatment to a sick child for any
reasdn." Cruelty and neglect cannot be condoned, even for rea-
sons of sincere religious belief. The jury has made an important
statement about the individual. Religion is a freedom, just like the
freedom to bear arms and the" freedom of the press. But we have
gun laws and libel laws to protect us from one individual trying
to exercise his or her rights to the exclusion of others’. Freedom
of religion is just as surely regulated by this standard, and it is good
that our courts have recognized it.

Interview With the Vampire and
The Vampire Lestat: by Anne
Rice ’

These books are, obviously,
about vampires. But these partic-
ular vampires aren't monsters -
they don't live in isolated coffins
in Transylvanian castles, they
can't turn into bats, and they
don't even look frightening. In
fact, though they are very pale.be-
cause they're ”dead,” they are
very handsome creatures. Inter-
view With the Vampire is set
primarily in 19th century languid
New Orleans; while The Vampire
Lestat takes place in Paris, ancient
Rome and England, Cairo, and

_modern _LosAngeles. The 20th. .

 

century vampires ride Harleys
and are financial investment
geniuses like Donald Trump
when they're not hanging out in
”vampire bars.”

H: I preferred Interview be-
cause it is beautiful, sensual writ-
ing. The melancholy,contem—
plative vampire Louis is the per-
fect narrator —— through him we
see the vampire’s perception, his
intricate view of the world. All

things are heightened, more '
colorful, brighter. Horrifying

things like slashing a woman's
wrist and draining her blood into
a wine glass, then drinking it, are
still mesmerizing and seductive
when Louis describes them.

I: I vastly preferred The Vam-
pire Lestat, because Lestat is so
strikingly full of life and energy,
even after death. Sensuality and
beauty are not necessarily restrict-
ed to the tableau-like beauty of a
painting or a sculpture. Lestat has
the animated sensuality of a
movie, or a rock video, and the

plot is complexly woven and ”

fast-paced.

H: Lestat is a large, blond, dead
barnyard cock, and that is why
you like his overly dramatic and

A tale of a mouse and a dragon

I grew up in Vietnam, and I can
remember sitting on my grand-
mother's lap and pleading for a
story. She could always think of
one, no matter how short or long.

VIET PHAM

This is her favorite fairy tale, and

ofcourse, being.Oriental, there is

always a message (no offense,
Grandma or Confucius). She told
me then that it had something to
do with Vietnam. ‘

Once upon a time, there lived
a cute little mouse who pro-
claimed himself the ruler of a
peaceful forest. He was not the
greatest leader, but the other
animals thought him amusing.
They found it difficult to listen to
such a teeny-weeny creature, but
he was tolerated nonetheless. All
the animals got along very well,
and all was joyful.

One fine day, a fox trudged in
from the nearby woods and said
to the mouse, ”Hi, little one. I'm
looking for the king of the forest.
Where is he?”

The mouse proudly pro-
claimed, ”|t is I whom you seek.

obnoxious, maniacal behavior.
He is shallow! He's in ‘love with
his mother, who seems dead
even in life! He likes to eat rats,
and he makes vampires out of
everyone and anyone, including
helpless little girls. The parts of
The Vampire Lestat that I really

enjoyed were, the parts that wer- ~

en’t about Lestat at all; rather,»
they dealt with the history of the
vampire “race.”

1: Oh, and I suppose Louis is
better, as he sits morbidly moon-
ing over his precious, lost human-
ity. What a crock! Louis is
pathetic in his ”me|ancholy,”

which is just another word for

”boringness.” If Lestat is a barn-

yard cock, Louis is a gnarled, old‘
turtle! I spit on Louis.

Anyway, we think you will en-

joy both of these novels, since

they complement each other well -
and also lead to further books in

the series.

Reading them may or may not

r make you want to be a vampire
and sip blood from your neigh-
bors’ necks, too. Supernatural

. creatures can be. very sed_uctiv_e, ;

 

I am the ruler of this vast
domain!”

The fox roared with laughter
saying, ”How can such a small,
puny creature command such a
great domain?!”

Well, the mouse became very
self-conscious and tromped away
thinking to himself, ”Why’s
everybody always pickin’ "on
me?” He started to neglect his
royal duties because, after all, he
was only a mouse. All of the
other animals wondered what
was wrong, but no one said a
word.

Meanwhile, the fox decided it
was time for a new ruler, so he
took upon himself the quest to
find a new king, but found no
one. Then one day, he spotted a
gentle dragon. He never bothered
anybody and always kept to him-
self (the Oriental version of Puff
the Magic Dragon). The fox
thought to himself, ”Gee, he
looks tough. I wonder what kind
of leader he could be?" So he
started convincing the dragon he
could be a great leader and how
all the other animals would
respect him. The dragon began to
believe all the flattery.

as the governess discovers in...
The Turn of the Screw: by Hen-
‘ ry James .

‘This 19th century novel is the
grandfather of the modern
ghost/horror story. Briefly, a neu-
rotic, emotional woman becomes
the governess of two unnaturally
adorable and sweet children who
live in the middle of nowhere in
the English countryside. This un-
fortunate nanny begins to see
strange apparitions of the previ-
ous, dead governess and her
dead lover, who has ”crispy,
close curling whiskers and wears
clothes that are not his own." Or
something like that. '

Anyway, this novel has been
interpreted to the moon and back
twice. over. Most of the con-
troversy concerns the ”reality” of
the apparitions. Some critics say
they are ghosts, while others in-
sist that the original ‘governess
and her lover are still alive. A few
even claim that the governess is
madand imagining the appari-
tions, because the critics them,-
selves, had crazy governesses as

Soon, the dragon began his
search for fame and fortune. He
tried to intimidate the other T
animals in the forest, ordering
everyone around and forcing
them to see his way. At first, no‘
one listened, but with the fox’s
help he was able to gain control
of the forest.

Then a rebellious, bald jackass ‘
tried to start a revolution. He H
thought no one should be a lead‘-' I
er. The other animals found him ”
absurd and scoffed at him.
However, the Buddha-bellied
panda bear stood up for the poor,
defenseless jackass and said, « 
”Wait, comrades, he has a point.‘ _ .2’-
We have no reason to listen to A 
the dragon. The mouse is our

By Tim Azinger

Assistant Showcase Editor

After two years of scheming si-
lence, Killing Joke is taking their

-juggernaut of musical intensity

back on the road with innovative
songs and a fresh lineup. Their
American leg of the tour will con-
quer twenty-four cities in a two-
month period, relishing a pen-
chant for original Killing Joke
style, accentuated by a thrilling
stage performance and intense
light show.

Killing Joke was spawned-from
Jaz Coleman's mystic and un-
compromising musical visions in

Cheltenham, England, in 1979._

The Are You Receiving 10-inch
EP set the band on a long and
often turbulent trek, during which
they, to date, have compiled six
albums and numerous singles,
with more in the works.

Killing}oke’s first full—length LP
came in 1980, when they
released their untitled. debut. It
contained the single ”The Wait,”
which seemed to attract more
media attention after being co-
vered by Metallica.

What's This For was released in
1981 and was followed by the
anthemic and critically acclaimed
Requiem a year later.

Then, 1984 brought Fire
Dances, and later in 1985 the

b"5nd produced Nighttime, con- I

taining the _ever-popular (and
probably most-played Killing Joke-
song), ”Love Like Blood.”

Bird of a Thousand Suns,
which came out in 1986, was the
last album from the longtime
lineup, which included Jaz,

- Geordie (guitar), Paul Raven

.i

(bass) and Paul Ferguson (drums).

This LP had a distinctively
different sound, more flighty than
previous Killing Joke material,
and it is often viewed as very un-

characteristic of the band. In fact, V

they rarely acknowledge its exis-
tence. '
After the ”demise of the two

Pau|s,” Jaz and Geordie worked

together with a drum machine to

. produce 1987's Across the Gate.

Finally, 1988 brought the refor-
mation of Killing Joke as a quar-
tet again. Jaz and Geordie
ushered in ex-Public Image Ltd.
drummer Martin Atkins and ex-
Smiths bassist Andy Rourke.

. Rourke lasted a mere three days

and was then ousted for being, as
Atkins affectionately described
him, ”a miserable little bastard.”

So, a mysterious individual by

, the name of Taif was incarnated

to replace Rourke. He is best
described by Jaz, who says, ”We
don't know anything about him,
except he's a great bass player
and very dangerous.”

Killing Joke cull plenty of
material from their ten—year vinyl
catalog, but also splice in tunes
from their upcoming release Ex-
tremities, for which no date has
been set.

Jaz’s background in classical
music and composition (wit-
nessed by his_recent completion
of a full five-movement orchestral

cycle, titled Idavoll) gives Killing.

Joke’s raw, uplifting sound a
definitive, elegant strain.

Combine this with the band's"

apocalyptic ideology and you
have the basis for Killing Joke’s

brazen, aggressive, moving
melodic style.

Jaz’s lyrics reflect a defiant
philosophy and notions of in-
difference while rooting them-
selves in refinement. Atkins
blends in his own drumming with

Taif's enigmatic bass pounding

 

and Geordie’s cognizant and
consistent guitar work.

Sum it all up by saying that on
their current tour, you get old
Killingjoke with an ardent flavor,
and "breathtaking nevi Killing
Joke.

Killing joke will be performing
at the Bellefield Annex on Sun-
day, April 27, at 8 p.m.

Rolling Stone Writer

The Rolling Stones’ fall tour of
North America has slipped
through the fingers of super-
promoter Bill Graham. Instead,
the self-styled World's Greatest

Rock & Roll Band signed a lucra- ,-

tive contract in mid-March with
Toronto promoter Michael Cohl,

International.

Cohl has guaranteed the Stones
an unprecedented $65 million to
$70 million. His deal allows him

i not only to promote the tour —
an estimated 50 to 60 dates in the
United States and Canada —- but
also to handle tour merchandis-
ing and oversee both a mega-
bucks sponsorship deal and
pay-per-view television special.

around Labor Day, following the
release of a new Stones album
currently being recorded at Air
Studios, on the Caribbean island
of Montserrat. To ensure the in-
terest of the MTV generation, the
Stones are considering Guns ’n’
Roses, INXS and Living Colour as
opening acts.

At press time, Cohl would not
comment on the tour — or even

Until Cohl pushed his way into
the picture, it was assumed in the
Stones camp that the tour would
go to Graham, who would _not
comment aboutthe tour or his at-
tempts to be a part of it. In addi-

another switch in their musical
lineage. The Cult had added a
definite metallic twinge. None of
the soft-spoken ballads from Love
were present, just dead—on rock,
including a cover of Steppen-
wo|f’s ”Born to be Wild.”

With Sonic Temple, The Cult
hasydropped back into the diver-
sified psychedelic role to a cer-
tain extent. They've found a
comfortable medium that allows
listeners to get the full Cult affect,
while letting each member show-
case his full musical abilities.

There's definitely a wide vari-
ety of musical tempos. lan Astbu-
ry still imparts his hypnotic

vocals, but he also does a majori-
ty of the percussion work. (For a
vocalist, he does an exemplary
job.) Billy Duffy cranks out a
riveting guitar articulation, while
Jamie Stewart solidifies the entire
rampage with a pounding bass, as
well as adding some keyboard.
Don't be dismayed, there's
plenty of pulsating rumblers that
have become The Cult’s mainstay
over the years. ”Fire Woman,”
”New York City” and ”Automat-
ic Blues” are just a few of the
demonic rippers on Sonic
Temple. '
”Edie (Ciao Baby)” and ”Wake
Up Time for Freedom,” revert to
the more mellow Cult style, just

to prove that Astbury can be sen-
sitive and brash in the same ar-
tistic endeavor.

Astbury is v a crooner whose
lack of melodious voicing hasn't
detracted from his sincere perfor-
mance. His wailing is packed
with plenty of intensity and en-
thusiasm to make up for any
shortcomings.

The Cult has kept fans waiting
for several years for this release,
and rightfully so. It's much better
to take the extra time to produce
an overall strong disk, than to
rush production and end up with
certain tracks that fall below the
standard of the rest of the album.

Sonic Temple is an engrossing
culmination of nearly a decade of
musicianship from The Cult. It
rolls from frantic to elegant to
cynical, while constantly relying

have several ”waifs” who come
and go on drums and percussion,
which is less important in their
wirey guitar stylings.

Their recording career started
with Sound of Confusion in
l985, a distorto meditation on
love, life and drugs — the three
topics which they consistently
imbue with their bitter and pas-
sionate perception.

Next came the release of two
12" EPs — Walking With /esus
and Transparent Radiation. These
two gems, featuring versions of
songs to come in different form
on their next record, were backed
by various cover tunes. It was in
these EPs that the Spacemen

sound solidified as well as the
high-quality design of their
jackets.

In 1987 the Spacemen 3 broke
with The Perfect Prescription, a
sonic tab of lysergic rush which
documented many stages of drug
use. From craving in ”Take Me
To The Other Side” to a bad trip
in ”Call the Doctor” and every-
thing in between, the Spacemen
spun webs of wah—riffing and
fuzz-droning as well as mellow

trumpeting, acoustic strumming
and multilayered violins to cul-
minate on what was possibly the
best record of last year. (Prescrip-
tion was imported to the U.S. in
1988.)

Each song of The Perfect
Prescription was unique and
must have been an incredibly
hard record for them to follow
up, but the Spacemen have dis-
covered even more ways to be
psychedelic.

Playing With Fire is a more uni-

form record showcasing their
one-chord songs featuring more
Vox organ and tremolo guitar,
and it is more comparable to Sui-
cide, to whom they dedicate the
twelve-minute instrumental of the
same name.

With the exception of the
MC5—inspired revolution, the
new songs have more divine im-
agery than poppy. Sonic’s artless
singing will be known in the fu-
ture as the voice of heavenly
yearning and divine rejection.

The Sonic Temple is fast be-
coming the hottest live music
spot in town. lf you're looking for
a veritable smorgasbord of
sound to satisfy every inclina-
tion, feast your eyes on this list
of national acts:

l:l l:l l:l

Screaming Trees — April 26.
The Seattle music scene has
turned out to be the most prolif-
ic in I989, with Soundgarden
and Skin Yard leading the way.
But the Screaming Trees have
been around for a while on the
SST label, exploring their

psychedelic and '70s influences.

Now their third LP Buzz Facto-
ry promises to bowl over all
skeptics. Opening bands are
Thin White Line and new drone-
popsters Futon.

D Cl l:l

White Zombie — April 27. A
strange metamorphosis took
place in New York as a band
known for its fearsome noise at-
tack a la Sonic Youth/Live Skull
suddenly became... a metal
band? But it's not metal as the

suburban kids know it — no
glam, no frills; nothing is more

consistently crushing. The ap-
pearance of Necropolis, Pitts-
burgh's best metal with a social
conscience, seals your doom.
Cl l:l l:l

Alice Donut — April 29. The
first New York band to be
signed to Jello Biafra's Alterna-
tive Tentacles label takes to the
road to promote their new
record. However, a new Philly
band called King Carcass may
actually steal the spotlight with
their combination of crunch and
wail. Also playing are Special
Ed and the one-man guitar and

Liof Munimula — April 30. Ex-
perimental music aficionados will
enjoy a performance by this
group of Chicago improvisers
whose instrumentation includes
shortwave radios, dumbek, and
”kalimba typewriter" (their own
invention). Ask for their new
record The Jonah Syndrome on
WRCT or WYEP, and receive
an earful of innovation. Active
Ingredient opens the evening
with some wacky art rock.

Moe Tucker and Half
Japanese — May T. This one is
billed as "two legends, one

show” and for good reason.

Back before most of you were
born, the Velvet Underground
were the most influential trend-
setters in what was later to be-
come the field of alternative
music. lvlaureen "lvloe" Tucker

' was their drummer, but she's re-

cently embarked on an amazing
solo career.

Half Japanese have been
amazing audiences for fifteen
years, and their output has
grown steadily, culminating in
the brand new The Band That
Wou/d Be Goa’. However, due
to the impending marriage of
singer Jad Fair (one of the most
popular guys in rock 'n' roll to-
day), this is unfortunately their
last tour ever. Both artists record
on the 50 Skidillion Watts label.
You should not miss this.

l:l l:l Cl

Thrill Kill Kult —— May 5. There

is a big difference between

dance music in an industrial set-
ting (i.e., the Metropol) and ”in-
dustrial dance music.” The Thrill
Kill Kult, like other dance groups
on the Wax Trax label, make
pounding music that takes no
prisoners, yet preserves the spirit
of fun.

Their new album, /See Good
S,oir/'ts.../ See Baa’ Spirits, is
definitely the funkiest road to
hell. lf you enjoyed the recent
concerts with lvlinistry, Skinny
Puppy, and Wolfgang Press,
this is certainly your bag. Local

electro—industrialists Silent Pray-

Screaming Trees

er and Za Dharsh add to the
good time.
l:l l:l El

Grisly Fiction and Orifice —
May 6. This year will see the
Philadelphia scene producing
some of the most promising un-
derground bands. Grisly Fiction,
a powerful drone unit, just put
out their first LP, Scrape Face,
and Orifice have a new cassette
called A Pretty Nice Guy which
resembles a bastard union of Big
Black and the Swans.

lmpressive? Well, opening
band The Heretics are beginning

 

to impress lots of important peo-
ple around the nation. Catch the
wave.
l:l D l:l

American Music Club — May
7. These Columbus denizens re-
cently relocated to San Francis-
co. No wonder their latest LP is
called Ca/ifornia, with rock-
raunchers like ”Bad Liquor” and
some more country—influenced
material.

When it comes to summer mo-

have become very, very familiar
in recent years. I mean, there's
only so many times you can
watch Eddie Murphy give those
goofy white guys the runaround.
And the world needs more Stal-

drunk Exxon employees.

That's why Hollywood is al-
ways looking for fresh young tal-
ent that can make the industry
lots and lots of money. Holly-
wOOd’s latest acquisition is Ya-
hoo Serious — writer, director
and star of Australia's blockbuster
comedy Young Einstein.

Looking a little like Ann Mar-

Yo u N GINSTEIN

Warner Bros. picks up
Australia’s all-time
biggest grossing picture

 

garet cast as the lead in Eraser-
head, Serious possesses a fiery
head of hair jutting in every direc-
tion, comic talent which has
earned him comparisons ‘with
Chaplin, Keaton and Woody Al-
len, and one of the best showbiz
names to come along since Andy
Warhol's batch of superstars.

During my interview with him,
the skinny thirty-five—year—old was
relentlessly cheerful, and with
good reason. Serious may be‘just
another extremely weird—|Ooking
dude in America, but Down Un-
der, he's a genuine cult
phenomenon.

Young Einstein has already
made $12 million in Australia.
Only E. T. and Crocodile Dundee
did more business in their first
five weeks.

Eccentrically handsome, Seri-
ous has become the latest Aussie
sex symbol. Theater owners can't

-put his posters up because they

are repeatedly stolen.

Warner Brothers is betting that
he's going to be the next big thing
in America as well. (Young Ein-
stein is coming to a theater near
you this July.) __

And if you haven't heard about

Serious yet, you'll hear about him I _

soon. Warner Brothers is spend-
ing $8 million in publicity on the
U.1.S. release... of Your1g;’Ein5t.§>in,.
twice what it cost Serious to make
the film. , l _

All the fuss has left this former:
tire fitter from rural Australia
dumbfounded. Serious says he
thought it would take several
films for him to build up an au-
dience.

”l’m surprised how readily ac-
cepted Young Einstein was,” says
Serious. ”People are hungry for
something different.”

Serious is definitely different.
Born in New South Wales with
the less interesting name Greg
Pead, he dropped out of school
at the age of fifteen and began
working twelve hours a day in an
auto shop:

He eventually enrolled in an art ,
school, studied painting and film,

_ and invented his ying—yang name.
: ’’If you say Yahoo,” says Serious,

The Cro-Mags retched forth
from the ferocious underbelly of
the New York hardcore scene.
Sporting shaved heads, heavily
tattooed bodies and a Krishna at-
titude, the Cro-Mags pummeled
their way to respect with their
hellion debut LP Age of Quarrel.

more member and position
changes, the Cro-Mags have set-

Harley Flanagan

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 20, I989

  

The Cro-Mags have always
presented a very intense live
show — plenty of sweat and fly-
ing bodies for those who are into
rigorous action.

Lead singer/bassist Harley
Flanagan sums up the Cro-Mags
as being ’’all about survival and
constant change," an attitude that
reflects his following of Vedic
religions. ~

Douglas Holland and Parris
Mitchell Mayhew team up for the
band's thrashing guitar section,
while Pete Hines rounds out the

 

group on drums.

According to Harley, Best
Wishes is a collection of his per-
sonal experiences. ”I hope peo-
ple get some insight from them
and are inspired to carry on,” he
says.

For the band, Best Wishes is
only the start of what they hope
will be a developing musical
career. ”This is just the begin-
ning,” says Harely. ”We're just
starting to see what we're shoot-
ing for musically. We have a lot

more ideas. There's a lot of evo-ié

lution in the name alone.’-’

The Cro-Mags will be perform-
ing with heavy metallists Destruc-
tion at City Limits,'this coming

 SOUND OF SILENCE

000000000000

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

After an eight—year hiatus from
the recording studio, reunited Lit-
tle Feat will bring its Let It Roll
tour to the A.J. Palumbo Center
tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.

The reunion of this twenty-
year-old band marks the return of
songs deeply rooted in the vast
spectrum of American sounds;
from R&B to jazz to blues to clas-
sic rock.

However, Let It Roll boasts a
variety of new songs, including
classic ”Featesque” perfor-
mances as well as contemporary
new song efforts headlined by
newcomer Craig Fuller, former
Pure Prairie League member.

Fuller's association with Little
Feat stretches back to the Feat’s
final tour, when he opened for
them as part of the Kaz Fuller
Band.

”We opened and closed the
audition the same day,” said
guitarist and longtime Little Feat
member‘ Paul Barrere of the day
Fuller tried out for the lead singer
slot.

Filling that slot, left by the late
Lowell George in 1979, was a
major concern of the original
band members.

”One of the biggest obstacles
we had to overcome was the ab-
sence of Lowell,” Barrere said.

”He was such an integral part
of what Little Feat was about that
at first we weren't sure how, or
even if, we could replace him.”

_ Fuller, ironically, sounds much
like the late George on virtually
every song on the new album.

such artists as James Taylor, Lin-
da Ronstadt and Simon and

Garfunkel, is quick to raise other
reasons for the hiring of Fuller.

”Craig has an uncanny ability
to sound like Lowell when he
wants to,” said Payne. ”But that
was hardly the reason we asked
him to join the band. Craig is
such an accomplished songwriter
and so versatile a singer, and
that's exactly what a band with
this kind of range needs.”

’’I really didn't feel any trepida-
tion about stepping into Lowell's
shoes,” Fuller said. ‘

”This is an entirely new chap-
ter for this band, which I've al-
ways considered one of the great
rock ’n’ roll groups of all time.
Sure, being in Little Feat is a
responsibility, but it's not some-
thing I've got to work to fulfill; it
comes naturally.”

Little Feat began back in 1969
with a group of fledgling players
who turned out nine vastly in-
novative albums over the next
eleven years.

Most notable are such classics
as Dixie Chicken, the double live
set Waiting for Columbus and
Hay Hoy.

The death of Lowell George in
1979 effectively brought a tem-
porary close to the band's career,
as the surviving members
released a final album in 1981
and went their separate ways.

Paul Barrere recorded two solo
albums, 1981's On My Own and
1982's Real Lies. He also played
for a while with L.A.-based band
The Blues Busters.

Drummer Richie _Hayward
played with loan Armatrading,

Warren Zevon, and for the past ‘

three years, Robert Plant.

' Bassist Kenny Gradney worked
with Grateful Dead guitarist Bob
Weir's spinoff group, Bobby and
the Midnighters.

Feat

Continued from page 21

that jam was that we were still a
band. What we had, we still had,
and it was tremendously exciting
to discover in each other again.

”Lowell was gone, but that was
no longer a reason not to
continue.”

Aside from Fuller, Fred Tackett
is the only new Little Feat
member.

Tackett had been on the band's
sidelines since its inception. He
had written ”FooI Yourself” from
Dixie Chicken and ”Be One
Now” from Down on the Farm.

Tackett has recorded and
toured with Boz Scaggs, Bob Dy-
Ian, and Jackson Browne.

’’It was perfect timing for me,”
Tackett said of his induction into
the Feat. ”You can only do so
many sessions before you start
wanting to find outlets for your
own music.

”There’s no better place to do
that than in this particular band.”

Indeed, when the writing four-
some of Tackett, Payne, Fuller
and Barrere got under way, they
came up with songs for the new
album which continued the re-
vered Little Feat tradition placed

in a contemporary setting.

Essentially Featesque perfor-
mances from the new album in-
clude ”One Clear Moment,”
”Business as Usual” and ”Hate
to Lose Your Lovin’.”

However, the band sounds
most like its old self on ”Chan-
gin’ Luck,” with its opening rock-
R&B Stratocaster chords and
steady, driving beat throughout
highlighted by observations of
the past:

”And I'd just like to feel/
Dreams I chased so long ago/
weren't wasted miles on empty
roads.”

Almost before the last track was
complete, Little Feat hit the road
to venture cross country and back
again, one night at a time.

’’Little Feat was the formative
musical experience of my life,”
said Hayward, ’’It was a band
built on improvisation, that abil-
ity to stretch out, to try new
things.

’’It was the best education any-
man could ever have. And I'm
glad to be back in class." ‘

By William Young
Managing Editor g

Obscure.

That's probably the most ac-
curate word that can be used to
describe The Fixx, the fivesome
from England whose only real
hits have been ”One Thing Leads
to Another” and ”Are We Our-
selves?” But -The ' Fixx do not
seem content to let themselves
fade away into the anonymity of
”new-wave invasion” bands of
the early '80s that never made it;
The Fixx seem to think they have
something to say.

Saying it has always been their
problem, though. The Fixx have
often been accused of the ”My
Sharona” type of lyrics: lyrics that

SCuFld good but don't seem to —

make any sense. But this just isn't
the case. A
Lead singer Cy Curnin didn't

go to’ the same song writing '

School as Bono. Curnin doesn't
feel the need to speak loudly and
carry a big stick, beating his fans
over the head with self-righteous
exhortations about the world's
ills. Curnin is more content to sit

back and‘ make listeners think —' I

and think hard. _ 
T he Fixx have probably never

been openly called ‘av ”socia'I?con— -
science” band. Their trademark «A
of broken lyrics leaves much to

the imagination,_,_and where im-

' ag'in’atio'ri " Iacks‘f""understanding

fails — hence bad reviews and
more obscurity. V
The Fixx have now come out

1-g

with Calm ‘Animals and are head- .

ing across the United States on
tour, trying to spread-their mes-
sage of lying politicians, confused
foreign policies and the general

screwiness of human existence. I

No sure-fire pop singles here. NO _

cheesy love ballads. No rampant
guitar solos.

. While Calm Animals may not
be as good 1983's ‘Reach the
"Beach, it certainly’comes close,

far outstripping their 1987 '

release, Walkabout, an‘ album
which was widely criticized as
being too dense and indecipher-

able. In response to this, The Fixx .

have made Calm Animals more
accessible, more focused.

Much of Calm Animals dwells
on the destruction of the environ-
ment, a subject that many pop

musicians have been taking to .

heart in the wake of the deforesta-
tion of the Amazon basin.

But where Sting would sing”

with as ‘much angst as he could
muster, Cumin employs a veiled

cynicism" that distances himself _

from self-proclaimed musical
messiahs like; Bono- and Sting,
giving a realistic sense of bewil-
derment to the songs.

With all the commotion being
generated by big-name bands,

/The Fixx offer an introspective . ' I
look at the same topics, only

without the heartburn." _

Australia, they say, ’Mel Gibson!

Despite his flamboyant name
and appearance, Serious says
glitz doesn't appeal to him.
”What feeds the artist/director is
having communication with the
world. You can't get locked into
all that bullshit,” he says.

His art school days are gone
forever, but Serious still considers
himself a very dedicated artist.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 20, 1989

”People generally don't associate
comedy with art,” he says. ’’I
tried‘ to put the movie together
like a supermarket where you
could take what you want.”

He insists that Young Einstein,
for all its camp and slapstick, is
an important film. ”l don't want
to make elitist films, but I think
you can get across complex in-
tellectual things if they're put the
right way.”

Like the real Einstein, Serious
is a pacifist, idealist and support-
er of world government.

manager, Joseph Rascoff.

In mid-February the Stones’
business adviser joined Jagger
and Richards in Barbados, where
the two chief Stones were work-
ing up material, for the album.

Both Graham and Cohl made

their way to Barbados to meet _

with the group in person over
Presidents’ Day weekend. Gra-
ham spent two fruitless days at-
tempting to convince the Stones
and their advisers that what had
worked the last time would work
again.

”Bill Graham was told that the
difference between his offer and
Cohl’s was ‘tens of millions,’ ”
said a source familiar with the
Barbados meetings. ”Over and
over he was told, ‘No matter
what you offer, you can't match
Cohl.’ ”

THE PITT NEWS

The following list of athletes
was compiled from a poll con-
ducted by The Pitt News sports
staff. Thelr appearance on this list
does not necessarily reflect their
play on the athletic field.

PAT SANTORO

Senior wrestler Pat Santoro is
the one Pitt athlete who has ris-
en above his sport. In his four
years as a 142—pounder, Santoro
competed in the NCAA tourna-
ment every year. _

But the last two tounaments
were exceptional: He won the
championship both times.

In 1987, he went undefeated at
48-0 and was the undisputed
champion. This past season, he
ran into a little trouble with Clari-
on’s Mike Cole, losing all three
times they wrestled.

In the NCAAs, Cole lost one
round before he faced Santoro. It
looked easy, but in one of the
toughest matches of Santoro’s
career, he won in overtime.

After the match, the usually
reserved Santoro put his fist in the
air and ran to his parents. A fit-
ting end to an exciting career.

“CURVIN RICHARDS

Curvin Richards, a freshman

from .LaPorte, Texas, unexpected-
ly broke into the starting tailback
spot in the fourth game of the sea-
son, a 34-31 loss at Boston
College. I

Richards rushed for 202 yards
that day, and went on to have’ the
most dominating freshman sea-
son of any Pitt back since the
days of Tony Dorsett.

Richards, ‘5-foot-10,
190-pounds, ground out 1,228
yards in 1988, finishing the sea-
son as the seventh all-time lead-

ing freshman rusher in NCAA_

history.

Richards, who was named The
Sporting News Freshman of the
Year, was a late entry into the Pitt

recruitng process. Pitt coaches —

recruited him only after they ar-
rived in Houston to play in the
1987 Bluebonnet Bowl.

BRIAN SHORTER

After losing first-round NBA
draft choices Charles Smith and
Jerome Lane, the Panther basket-
ball team was expected to have
a letdown of sorts, at least in the
inside game.

But Brian Shorter, a Prop 48
sophomore, admirably filled that
void, averaging 20 points and 10
rebounds per game to capture the
Big East Newcomer of the Year
award and lead Pitt to the NCAA
tournament for the third consecu-
tive year.

Shorter, 6-6, 230-pounds, near-

ly broke Wilt Chamberlain's"

Philadelphia city-scoring record
before transferring ot Oak Hill
Academy in Virginia for his
senior scholastic season. A I

two years ago, and Shorter's per-
formance on the ﬂoor this season
left no doubt about his ability.

He had arguably the finest
freshman season of any Big East
freshman ever, and also set a Pitt
field goal percentage record,
shooting" 59 percent from‘ the
ﬂoon I

JERRY OLSAVSKY

Jerry Olsavsky has been the
picture of consistency and excel-
lence for the Pitt football team. As
a three-year starter (four-year let-
terman) at middle linebacker for
head coach Mike Gottfried, Ol-
savsky has averaged over 100
tackles per season, including 129
in 1988, becoming only the sec-
ond Panther. to have three con-
secutive 100-plus tackle seasons

since the early. 1970s.

”I can't say enough about his
leadership and what he has
meant to us,” said Gottfried.

Pitt fans will most remember,
aside from his toughness and un-
canny determination, Olsavsky
for his remarkable 57-yard inter-
ception return for a- touchdown in
a 1986 battle against Navy.

He was a little disappointed
when he_was not invited-to the

with the intensity of Olsavsky can
hook on somewhere.

LORRI JOHNSON

Lorri Johnson, a junior from

V New Castle, Pa., this year fulfilled

the promise that followed her
from New Castle High School in
1986.

The 5-11 Johnson — the sec-
ond leading scorer in Western’
Pennsylvania scholastic history —
led the Panthers in both scoring

and rebounding in the regular .

season with 24.3 points per game
and an 8.5 rebound average.

The former statistic places her
among the top 15 collegiate
scorers in the nation.

Johnson was the leading scorer
and second-leading rebounder
for the Lady Panthers in 1987-88.

Johnson was hindered by knee
surgery in 1986-87, but was not
eligible to play due to Prop 48.

never really considered a big
power. That was until this season
when five wrestlers were invited
to the NCAAs.

One of the biggest reasons for
this is Coach Rande Stottlemyer.

A former standout Pitt wrestler.
Stottlemyer took over the coach-
ing reigns in 1979. He suffered a
number of tough seasons while
he, built up depth and consisten-
cy in the team.

Stottlemyer graduated from Pitt
in 1978 with a bachelor's degree
in physical education. He was a
three-time All-American.

Although he is losing two-time
champion Santoro, the recruiting
and coaching skills of Stottlemyer
have given Pitt capable replace-
ments to step in.

This season, the team was
ranked in the top 20 all year and
promises to stay there for.some
time. He should be around for a
while and could help make Pitt

a very competitive wrestling,

school.

Pittbull wrestling club looking for respect-..

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor «

”Pittbull Wrestling? Isn't that
dangerous?”

It wasn't the first time that
someone asked Tim Buchanan if
he really wrestled against the in-
famous dogs. As he displays the
logo on his red, white and black
jacket — the object of all the at-
tention — he laughs. ”People

of these athletes will continue to
pursue their sport for a universi-
ty or college after graduation.

Pittbull Wrestling allows those
who will not compete on that lev-
el after high school, or whose col-
legiate eligibility has expired, to
continue to wrestle.

The Pitt wrestling team (an en-
tirely different animal than the
Pittbull club) has become a na-

Presently, the club claims no
less than 37 members, and that
sometimes ranges to 50.

”You do as little or as much as
you want,” Buchanan says, ex-
plaining the discrepancy in the
number of members.

Over 100 members are expect-
ed next year, Buchanan says.

Two factions of the club
differentiate the hardcore mem-
bers from those who just wish to

at, we put an equal amount of
time and effort into it.”

But this club is not just an ex-
tension of the annual Pitt in-
tramural wrestling day. The
Pittbulls are registered members
of the USA Wrestling Network,
which is a Group A member of
the U.S. Olympic Committee.

Pitt lacrosse team continues winning waysu

By Ed .Kuznik

Staff Writer

The Pitt lacrosse team con-
tinues to have a sensational 1989
season, winning two of their
three games during the past week
to improve to 9-3 for the year.

After a disappointing 14-7 loss
to Washington and Jefferson at
Pitt Stadium last Thursday, the

Panthers came back to defeat
Slippery Rock 8-7 on Sunday
night and Wheeling 5-1 Tuesday
night.

The matchup with Washington
and Jefferson matched two of the
top five clubs in the Allegheny
Lacrosse League, and for that rea-
son the loss was particularly dis-
couraging, according to team
co-captain Orfeu Buxton.

”We couldn't take advantage
of a lot of penalties against
them,” Buxton said. ”They had
19 penalties and we couldn't
capitalize on more than two of
them. Plus they were a quick
team, and we couldn't seem to
handle that.”

It also did not help that Pitt's
normally dependable starting
goaltender, Skip Leezer, stopped

only five of 19 shots taken against
him.

Things picked up for Pitt in the
next contest, however, as Lee
Stember exploded for the second
time in two weeks. He notched
four goals for the evening, while
Erik Weber had two and Phil
Preston and Dave Kounas had
one apiece.

Two nights later, Stember
scored twice and Brian‘Oles, We-
ber and Kounas each added a
goal.as the Panthers handled
Wheeling easily.

”Skip really came back in that
game,” said Buxton. ”We really
needed a big effort from him and
we got that.” '

Only two more games remain
for Pitt for the year, including a
matchup with the tough West
Virginia club tonight at Pitt Stadi-

um and Sunday's battle with
Frostburg State.

A However, considering the fact
thatbefore this season, no other
Pitt group had won more than
three games in a year, the Pan-
thers can rest on their laurels no
matter what happens in those fi-
nal two contests.

”We accomplished what we
wanted to and had a lot of fun do-
ing it,” Buxton said. ”We’re 9-3
with two games left, and we have
everybody coming back next
year, plus a lot of good recruits
looking to play next year.”

”We’re playing a lot better as
we go along,” Stember, who
leads the squad with 24 goals in
11 games, said. ”Personally, I'm
more optimistic as we go along,
and that makes me play better.”
