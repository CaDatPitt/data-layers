Elaine Burnes was thrilled
when a Reserve Ofﬁcer’s Training
Corps representative came to her
high school to recruit students
for the program at Pitt. That was
before she knew she was gay.

“If they find out that you are
gay, you will definitely be kicked
out. They will even do it if they
just suspect you,” Burnes said.

Burnes said that the anti—gay
atmosphere at the ROTC led her
to leave the program.

“The officers would always be
fooling around with each other
and saying, ‘Don't go near him,
he’s gay.’ They were always
teasing each other that way. They
would mostly tease the men and
say, ‘Come over here, you little
homo,’” she said.

“After awhile, I just decided
that I couldn't go on leading a
double life in the Army.”

Burnes left the ROTC after her
first term as a sophomore. Had
she stayed and been asked to
contract with the Army at the end
of this year, she would have
been required to sign a statement
indicating that she was not a
homosexual.

“If you openly admit that you
are a homosexual, it is a

disqualiﬂer. We don’t make the

policy, the Army does,” said

Captain Raymond Horoho.
Horoho said that the Army

. Force

   

policy which states
“homosexuality is incompatible
with military service” is justifiable.

“What I say doesn’t set Army
policy, but the reason for this
policy is for the discipline and
the good order of the service.
You are asking people to go out
and to ﬁght for their country. If
moral problems are caused
because of some people’s sexual
preference, then that may deter
from our ability to fight and to
win the battle,” he said.

Horoho said that morale
problems would be caused by
the attitude that most people
take against gay people.

“Take society’s view of it. You
would probably find in a society
more people uncomfortable
around a guy or a girl that was
attracted to a person of the same
sex. I don’t know how I would
feel if my foxhole mate was
attracted to me sexually. I don’t
know if that is something that I
want to worry about in the heat
of battle or in the heat of training
or anything else,” he said.

Sue Hyde, staff member of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task
in Washington, D.C.,
disagreed.

“In November a Gallup poll
said that 60 percent felt that
homosexuals should be allowed
to serve in the military. The tide
of public opinion is changing,
but the movement hasn’t hit the
Pentagon,” she said.

ROTC programs discriminate against gays and lesbians

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

ROTC programs throughout the country may be forced to redeﬁne their sexual conduct
standards regarding gays and lesbians.

Horoho said that homosexuals
in the military would do more
harm than good.

“What happens if you put a guy
in a room and he doesn’t want a
homosexual roommate? There are
fiscal concerns here too. What if
we didn’t have enough
homosexual men to fill a hall? It
is getting into a management

problem that we just don’t need
to have," he said.

\Mark Smith, president of Pitt’s
Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, said thatHoroho’s claims
are unfounded.

“Forty or 50 years ago, the A

Army ,would segregate black
people because society didn’t
. think they were competent. The

same thing is happening here.
When I go to the bathroom, I
don’t look at the other men or
touch them. This whole housing
thing is ridiculous,” he said.

At universities across the
country, this policy has sparked
protest and calls to throw the
ROTC off campus. The latest

AYH provides low-cost
travel accommodations

By Iarry Chough
Staff Writer

For students who are looking
for a travel adventure but are a
little short on cash, the Pittsburgh
Council of the American Youth
Hostels has a program that just
might make that trip a reality.

The group has recently issued
a brochure providing information
about the 15 hostels located in
Pennsylvania, as well as giving a
general overview of what a youth
hostel provides.

The brochure describes hostels
as “low-cost travel
accommodations where AYH

members can sleep.» and eat"

inexpensively." Bathroom and
kitchen facilities are provided, as
well as a “common room” where
hostelers can socialize with others
residing at the hostel.

Membership is open “to anyone
with an inquisitive mind and an
adventuresome spirit.” There is
no age limit, and the women's
sleeping accommodations are
separated from the men's.

In addition to the overall
purpose of providing low-cost

accommodations, the hostels are
designed to encourage all
hostelers to interact with each
other and provide information
on the various points of interest
near each specific hostel. One
way the hostels accomplish this
is by only providing service from
5 p.m. to 9 a.m. the next morning.
These hours force the hostelers
to engage in outside activity until
the hostel opens up again that
evening.

The maximum stay is three
days, and cleanup chores are
shared by all hostelers. Alcohol
is prohibited, and smoking is
restricted.

According to Marianne Kasica,
eastern regional vice president of
the national board of AYH, “the
object of hostels is for purposeful
travel and interaction with other
travelers and with what the
location has to offer.”

Kasica feels “the hostels provide
a little bit of the taste and style of
the environment that the hosteler
is in, and is an excellent way to
provide a traveler with a low-cost
opportunity to see different parts
of the country.”

THIS DAY IN
HISTORY

Feb. 20, 1988

A Pitt-Georgetown
basketball game at the Civic
Arena ended in a bench-
clearing brawl. Pitt was
winning 70-65 with four
seconds left, when both
benches emptied. The game
was suspended, and Pitt was
declared the winner. The
brawl prompted Big East
officials to institute stronger
rules to prevent further
violence on the court,
including a one-game
suspension for any player
involved in a ﬁght.

Feb. 20, 1977

Vandals tipped scaffolds
over onto concrete slabs
behind the law-school
building, causing $104,000 in
damages.

THE PI'l'l' NEWS, Tuesday, February 20, 1990

Feb. 15 —— A man admitted to a
staff member that he had hit the
boiler-room garage door of
Forbes Hal‘. with his car. The man
said that he had left his name,
phone number and address with

building security, but it turned "V

out that he had lied.

Feb. 15 —— A student reported
taking her engagement ring off
while driving and placing it in her
lap. When she parked in UD lot
behind Pennsylvania Hall, she
forgot that she had the ring in her
lap and left her vehicle. When
she returned, she couldn't find it.

Feb. 16 — An officer on
Oakland Avenue observed a man
banging on the window of Gus
Miller's News Stand. When she
approached him, the man got
into a car, which then sped off,
causing her to injure her hand on
the car’s antenna. A campus police
car pursued the car and stopped
it at the intersection of Bates and
Bouquet Streets. There were two

open bottles of beer in the front
seat and a case of beer and seven
packages of pita bread in the
back. The man admitted taking
the pita bread out of a bakery
tmck before being approached
on Oakland Avenue.

Feb. 16 —— A student said that
she had been assaulted by two

men while walking down Fifth ,

Avenue. One approached her,
grabbing and bruising her face,
while the other held her and
attempted to punch her. She
broke away and ﬂed to the
Towers. The man who held her
was carrying a case of beer.
Feb. 16 — A student living in
Tower B reported that he got into
an argument with his roommate
about whether the TV should be
on or off. The two shut the TV on
and off about 15 times before the
roommate threatened to kill the
student because he was tired of
his attitude.,They began to wrestle
each other around the room, and

the student’s left pinky was
broken. Campus police were
askedto file judicial papers against
the roommate. The student was
advised to get in touch with the
housing office to see about getting
his room changed.

Feb. 17 —— A student told
campus police that her roommate
had taken 22 Tylenol tablets and
drank a couple of beers. While
waiting for the ambulance to
arrive, the police officer was
informed that the roommate had
run into the Towers’ lobby area.
She was found in the laundry
room and taken to Presbyterian-
University Hospital.

Feb. 18 —-—— A student reported
that she was stuck in an elevator
in Lothrop Hall. The building
engineer and campus police
officer tried for approximately 45
minutes to repair the elevator but
could not. The door was open
wide enough for the student to
get out.

You’d like your roommates
a whole lot better if they didn’t
show up on your phone blll.

John called Chicago. Andy called L.A. Or was that Pete?

  Um'ty: The Wrath of Bonn

Last week, insults and heated debate filled the West
German Parliament in Bonn over the issue of German
reunification. The opposition Social Democrats called
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl a rabble-rouser
and accused him of pushing for reunification for his own

, personal interests.

To accuse Kohl of such is the moral and ludicrous

* equivalent of World War II isolationist Republicans
’ accusing Franklin.Roosevelt of entering the United States ,
. into the warfor the sole purpose of strengthening and

salvaging the struggling U.S. economy. It’s-petty, stupid
and shameful politics. A .. e .

Kohl’s party, the Christian Democrats, retaliated by
blasting the opposition for its friendly relations with the
East German Communist party ,— fortified by a joint
declaration of common goals signed by the parties two
years ago. Kohl exploited the declaration by shouting:

. “Do you want me to read out your joint statement? Only

A a few weeks ago you were against unity.” The ﬂoor leader

for the Christian Democrats shouted at the opposition that A

“for a long time you were at peace with the wall and
barbed wire.’’ » 1
*' One observer» aptly accused both parties of burying
‘German unityunder a “brutal party fight for power.”

Party politics seem to have no moral boundaries,
whether they be in Germany or the United States or
anywhere. The common theme always seems to be party
first, then nation. West Germany better unify‘ itself before
it unifies Germany.

All 8 loud on Eastern from‘!

On Dec. 25, the Romanian people treated themselves to
their most joyous Christmas gift in the past 40 years: the
removal and assassination of Nicolae Ceausescu, a brutal,
vile dictator who ran their beloved homeland with an iron

 fist. The Western world, enjoying the latest action—packed

chapter on the forfeiting of communist ideology, immedi-
ately interpreted the end of Ceausescu as the end of com-
munism in Romania.

After all, all the drama was there to provide the perfect
storybook ending to the Romanian tragedy: massive
crowds of Romanian people taking their hostilities and

revolution to -the streets, chanting anti-communist slo-_

gans, storming the dictator’s headquarters, cutting the
Communist symbol from their ﬂags before hoisting and
waving them high in the air, and even a helping hand
offered, ironically, by the Soviet Union to help crush the
secret police and government horde.

However, after painfully but patiently waiting over a
month (a very long time in modern Eastern European
standards) for the disbanding of the Romanian Commu-
nist Party, the Romanian. people took tothe streets again,
this weekend reverently chanting “the last solution, an-
other revolution!” as they charged into the headquarters
of the current government, hauled out its leader and
demanded the end of Communist rule. '

Apparently, December’s bloodshed didn’t go far enough.
Let’s hope the Romanians get what they fought for this

time. .

The Political Action Committee
of the Black Action Society spon-
sored a candlelight vigil on Jan.
15, 1990 in commemoration of
the 1969 computer-room take-
over. This takeover was in re-
sponse to the lack of opportuni-
ties allotted to the black students
who were attending [Pitt] _at that

time. The majority, members of

Black Action Society, who were
part of the [1969] event had an
agreement between themselves
and the chancellor stating:

a) The university would pro-
vide better action on the de-
mands of black students. ,

b) An institution for black stu-

.dents would be established,

which would provide scholar-
ships and ﬁnancial aid to blacks.

c) A special recruiter and a I
recruiting team to be screened by ,

the BAS, and established to re-
cruit more black students to the
school.

d) A special section in the Hill-
man Librarybe set up for black
students and, A

e) Two black holidays would
be recognized during the school
year. The two dates, which must
be approved by faculty senate,
were Jan. 15, the birthday of Dr.
Martin Luther King and Feb. 21,
anniversary of the death of Mal-
colm X.

We were also honoring Dr.
King’s birthday, along with other
prospective blacks who contrib-
uted to the black community and
those who were instrumental in
our struggle to attend the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

The only response to this event
was an incomplete statement and

. a picture on the front page of the

Jan. 16, 1990, issue of The Pitt
News. This stirred uneasy feel-
ings among a number of the
students here at the university, in
that there was an opportunity for
an article to be printed about the
event. There were many indi-
viduals who attended the vigil, in

particular, a few who were pres-
ent at the 1969 takeover who
could have been interviewed. ,

It’s a shame that our school

‘newspaper neglected to report

this program.‘ This clearly slaps
the faces of: A _
1) The black studies Depart-

  Letters

ment.

2) The Black Action Society.

5) The original people who
took over the computer room in
1969, and

4) The students who attended
the vigil. 1 4

A Apparently this news staff
doesn’t understand the signifi-
cance of the candlelight vigil.
This commemoration is part of
Pitt’s history whether they (news
staff) like it or not and should be
recognized by all. If Community
Outreach can express their views
about the homeless in the com-
munity and be heard, as well as
responded to, why can't we have
a special event covered in its
proper perspective?

The local media gave the pro-
gram more attention than the Pitt
News [did]. We have to hold
accountable this newspaper be-
cause every racé of students is
not equally represented. Stop
trying to be Time magazine by
having articles concerning com-
munism, and be democratic.

No changes at 

I object to the Pitt News edito-
rial [“Smoking in the Girls’ Room”]
of Wednesday, Feb. 14, 1990, in
which you react to the announce-

Pitt News: no honorable mention

ment that Chatham College may
become a coeducational institu-
tion by encouraging Chatham
students opposed to the change
to “abandon their archaic prefer-
ences.” Is it truly “archaic” for a
woman to desire a top-ﬂight
education in an environment
which provides her the opportu-
nity to be an individual, to enjoy
extracurricular activities with
emphasis on the concerns and
interests of women?

You go so far as to make the
condescending suggestion that
Chatham students will not be
able to survive in the real world
without the benefit of the female-
male interaction standard in most
colleges! Tell that to the legion of
successful Chatham graduates,
such as Pittsburgh’s director of
parks and recreation and Pitts-
burgh’s! new city solicitor, both
proud Chatham alumni. The list
continues indefinitely.

Chatham is not a religious order! ’

The fact that classes are com-
prised solely of women does not
mean that the students are iso-

lated from contact with men! To 9

the contrary, numerous avenues
which the school encourages,
are available to students to so-
cialize in the general campus
community. S '

The fact is that Chatham is a
proud, honored Pittsburgh insti-
tution, which for well over a
century has owed much of its
success to existing just as it is
today, as a women’s institution of
higher education.

At a time when the number of
women’s colleges has been de-

clining markedly, Chatham has

thrived. Its financial position is
sound.’ It continues to attract
superior students and to offer a
superior education.

Students who desire such an
education should have the choice!
The tradition should be main-
tained.

Military cuts must be consistent with U.S. security i

No sooner had President Bush
released his budget for ﬁscal year
1991 than a partisan battle began
in Congress over the relatively
small proposed decrease in the
budget for the Department of
Defense. And prior to the re-
lease of the president’s budget
proposal, I heard the absurd idea
that the military budget be de-
creased by half and an urban
“Marshall Plan” initiated.

Not only is calling a plan to
revive urban areas a “Marshall
Plan” a bad analogy (the circum-
stances in both cases are vastly

. different), it is an ignorant idea

that asserts that since strategic
concerns have eased a little in
Europe, the military budget can
be cut in half.

There is no doubt in my mind
that the military budget can be
decreased by cutting waste and
reducing troops in NATO coun-
tries and the Far East. Addition-

ally, eliminating antiquated weap— '

ons systems and dispensable
domestic bases would decrease
the budget signiﬁcantly as well;
However, many of these reduc-

tions cannot take place overnight.
They must take place incremen-
tally over time.

e We must realize that significant
reductions in the military budget
will have drastic effects on the
economy. With troop reduc-
tions comes unemployment; with
base closings comes unemploy-
ment, and with cancellation of
antiquated weapons systems
comes unemployment.

Many businesses, large and
small, defense- or non-defense-
related, are supported by the
military, in part or in whole, in
one form or another. While all of
these businesses would not nec-
essarily fail, there would be rec-

autoless students at Pitt. It’s okay
for the most part during the
semester; South Oakland pro-
vides a convenient liquor store,
pizza places en masse and let us
not forget Forbes Variety for all
your party needs.

However, when daydreaming
about leaving this humble state

' to head home, I once thought the

words “pure, unadulterated hell”
were quite poignant to my situ-
ation. Ah, but age and wisdom
show us the quirks of our youth.

I used to take that lovely long
steel dog home, the one that
rides off into the sunset likea bad
cowboy ﬂick. Unfortunately, I
have a nasty nicotine addiction
which instantly brands me “leper”
and seats me next to recently
released ex-cons or people who
think they were Napoleon in their
past life. Then there was that
ever-present smell, the pumped-
in odor du jour. Now mix all that
with cigarette smoke, sweat and
that sticky stuff on the ﬂoor and I
had the stomach Olympiad per-
forming in my belly. It was just
getting to be too much.

One day last semester_while
stressing quite badly about the
prospect of meeting the next Ted
Bundy on my way to Washing-
ton, D.C., I noticed a gray wolf
howling at the moon on a TV
advertisement. Now, I think that
wolves are some of Mother Na-
ture’s most stunning creatures,
and the commercial caught my
eye. It was an ad for a major
railroad company, and my curi-
osity was piqued, so when I
watched those picturesque im-
ages of America ﬂashing past my
eyes, I was hooked. I

I took the big step and called
the train system. Their rates were
reasonable and, in fact, were less
expensive than the bus. Even the

time to get to D.C. was compa-
rable with the long dog. So I did
it; I booked a trip home.’

When I ﬁrst boarded the train
around 6 a.m., I was greetedby a
rather cheerful conductor. “This
way darling, if you need help
with your luggage, just let me

know.” Whoa  this guy must
have had an extra cup of java this
morning, I thought. I walked into
the car and noticed the seats,
which looked like mini—Craftrnatic
adjustable beds. They looked
more comfortable than my bed at
home. Well, I was just tired, I
thought, give me a couple of
hours of sleep, and we’ll see.

I woke up later; the day went
from a bleak morning to a bright,
sunny day. I stumbled backeto
the dining car for coffee and
some breakfast, while I learned
the ﬁner points of balance and
speed within a closed space.

I couldn’t keep from looking
out the window the whole time
while ‘watching the scenery slip
deliciously by, and although there
weren't any wolves, it was still
something to watch.

I walked back through the
lounge car ‘where I quickly
memorized the prices for mixed
drinks and beer -and headed
back to my seat. Just as I sat
down, the conductor told me that
the dome car was open.

“The what?” I asked, confused

by his statement. He pointed

toward a pair of steps leading
upward and said, “The dome
car!” Well, I’m an adventurous
spirit, so I went up the steps...

The top of the car was all glass, ‘

so you could see what seemed
like forever. The rest of the pas-
sengers were quietly looking at

r the day and scenery unfold be-

fore their very eyes. It was almost
a reverent atmosphereas we sat
in silence in ourcomfy Craftmatic
seats. All the homework I had I
procrastinated into the doldrums

l of responsibility, and I began to

contemplate my place in the great.
scheme or. things.
Because it was the time of year

‘ when the days are shorter, Iwas

witness to a breathtaking sunset.
They then turned on the big
searchlight on the head car, and
I began to imagine that I was on
top of a great snake that laby-
rinthed its way through the dark-
ness. It was quite a vivid image
that ran amok in my mind.

It was then announced that we
were minutes away from our
destination and reality slapped
me into consciousness. As we
derailed at Union Station in the
heart of D.C., I was still a little
quiet from the cosmic contem-
plations of the dome car. Why
had I ever wasted so much time
and money on the bus when the
train and the dome car (read:
heaven and truth) were there all

Well, since that fateful first day
atop the steel snake, I have taken
the train many times. Nothing,
not even ﬂying, can match the

United States.

Therefore, any ideas of major
military reductions must be
dropped in favor of incremental
ones. In doing so, business and
government will have time to
redirect emphasis from military
employment to other sectors of
the economy. While this will
take money, that which is saved
from defense reductions could
help to redirect employment and
investment (the so-called “Peace
Dividend").

Unfortunately, the “Peace Divi-
dend” will not be as large as
expected, no matter what course
of action is taken. Additionally,
with all of the departments and
agencies of the federal govern-
ment demanding this money, the
amount that each eventually gets
will be insigniﬁcant and unable

to relatively change or improve.

anything.

Even though many want to cut
the defense budget because of
changes in Europe, they fail to
realize that the United States also
has national-security concerns in
other parts of the world as well.

Many of these areas have the
potential of increasing in strate-
gic importance, especially if Cold
War intervention in these coun-
tries ceases, and they begin to
exercise international rather than
national goals.

While the defense budget needs
to be trimmed and the procure-
ment process reformed, the
United States must continue to
keep an adequate defense sys-
tem which will be continually
advanced technologically. If we

leave Europe and the Far East, S

we lose bases that are of strategic
importance, not simply in deter-
ring the actions of the Soviet

Union, but those of other coun- .

tries and regional powers as well.
I can assure the reader that this
course of action is much more
favorable to massive reductions,
and therefore massive unemploy-
ment and decreased investment
in the American economy, than a
loss in national security.

this, my blood boiled.

velop his future.

Student Athlete.-  
Oxymoron or not a moron?

My hate level for football players rose to a high two weekends -
ago when I heard that Pitt’s defensive tackle Marc Spindler was
passing up his senior year to join the NFL draft. When I heard

-What Spindler needs to understand is that quitting the team
doesn't necessarily mean quitting college. He could have waited .
and stayed here until he got his degree so he could better de-

Although Spindler said that he would go back to get his
degree, I have some reservations. ‘

~ During my brief tenure at Penn State, I knew a student named
Leonard who used to ask me to drive him home from classes
every day. In two years, Leonard developed into a top student.
I was impressed with his high marks in algebra and business law.

And then, without warn-
ing, he dropped out for no
apparent reason and is now
working at a welfare office
in Uniontown as a janitor.
Leonard told me that he is
planning to come back as L
soon as he saves some money. Great, but then again, I know
Leonard. He was always asking me for money like there was no
tomorrow.

Last year, I read an article in Time magazine on college ath-
letes who dropped out of colleges to try to make it in the major
leagues. Unfortunately, they ended up in the same place where
Spindler will end up: nowhere. .

One student played on a minor-league basketball team after
leaving school with a grade-point average of 2.0., Another
student became a doorman at a New York luxury hotel after he
dropped out to try an unsuccessful bid for the NFL. Whenever
I think of these “nowhere men," I think of poor old Leonard.

Spindler’s ﬂimsy excuse was that the departures of coaches
Mike Gottfried and FrankAD’Alonzo were the reasons for his
departure. He also aims to help hisfamily financially. I would
like to know if there are other reasons besides those excuses.
Greed and a low GPA mightbe other factors.

Now don’t get me wrong, I think there are some college
athletes who excel physically, academically and mentally.
Unfortunately, my hate level is based on college football players
and pro-rookie players‘ who are greedy, arrogant, overpaid,
under-talented and overambitious.

If athletes want to make good money, I suggest they stay in
college and continue to develop theirminds. Hey, the money
can wait. It will still be there after they graduate. They just need
to plan ahead wisely. a

While I was reading Lisa Bimbach’s College Book, I picked up
on a statement by a former Pitt student which-sums up what we
non-athletic types feel about football players: “Football players
here think they are God. I swear, they are nothing but dumb
jocks. They shouldn’t be in college." So take my advice: be a
winner, don’t be a Spindler.

ROTC

Continued from page 1
controversy comes from
Wisconsin University, where the
faculty voted to recommend
severing contracts with the ROTC
by 1993 if the military doesn't
end discrimination against gays
and lesbians.

“. If a university has added
sexual orientation to [its] anti—
discrimination policy then they
have a better chance of being
able to get rid of the ROTC on
campus," said Hyde.

Hyde is part of the Gay and
Lesbian Military Freedom Project.

“A lot of universities have anti-
discrimination policies that

   

include gays, and they have the
ROTC on campus. The two don’t
go together, but the problem is
that a policy has to have people
behind it who are willing to
enforce if it is going to have any
teeth,” Hyde said.

Pitt amended its anti—
discrimination policy in 1988 to
include discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation, but
Elaine Frampton, assistant director
of Pitt’s Affirmative Action office,
said that the policy hasn’t been
put to a test yet.

“The issue of the ROTC has
been a touchy subject around
here and has been brought up

several times, but since no one
has come up with a discrimination
complaint yet, we have not set a
clear—cut policy on what to do
with the ROTC,” she said.

Hyde said that some universities
have ulterior motives for keeping
the ROTC on campus.

“The reason that some
universities are hesitant to enforce
this policy is because the ROTC
does a lot for them. They bring in
a lot of people that probably
wouldn't normally attend that
school, and they bring in a lot of
scholarships,” she said.

Horoho said that Army policy
has to come before the university.

“This is where we straddle the
fence. As much as we are a part
of the University of Pittsburgh,
our first allegiance is to the U.S.
Army. We comply to university
regulations, and we comply to
U.S. Army regulations, but when
the two don’t jive, then the Army
regulation is going to be the one
that wins out," he said.

Morgan Marietta, who is a
sophomore in the ROTC program,
said that the military, by nature, is
discriminatory.

“I don’t think that anyone in
the university should be offended.
Joining the ROTC is optional..
Not everyone can get in. We're

not asking any of those

homosexuals to come over here,” ,

he said.

Horoho said that ROTC is made
up of a wide variety of students.

“Just average all—American
college students take ROTC. They
are not Hitler youths, and they
are not junior militants; they are
just all-American college kids.
They are kids that do college-
kids kinds of things. Some of
them drink beer; some of them
play basketball; some of them
listen to music; some of them are
very religiously oriented. They
are everything but homosexual, I
guess," he said.

Every afternoon before
basketball practice begins for the
Pitt Panthers at Fitzgerald Field
House, a Pitt freshman is there
shooting a ball around.
Sometimes he shoots alone; other
times a few Panther reserves
arrive early and shoot along with
him. Eventually, however, the

 

whole varsity squad meanders
onto the court, practice begins
and the freshman is forced to
step aside. He leaves quietly, but
he'll come back tomorrow.

The freshman is tall and beefy

him to play. They can’t.

Late rally by Clarion
proves costly to Pitt
wrestlers in 18-14 loss

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team seized
an early lead against Clarion on
Saturday but was unable to hold
off the 19th-ranked Golden
Eagles, losing 18-14.

Pitt wrestling coach Rande
Stottlemyer was very pleased with
his team’s performance despite
the loss. T

“I thought we wrestled a lot
better than earlier in the season,”
said Stottlemyer. “We are climbing
the ladder towards success, and
our experience is finally starting
to pay‘ off.”

The Panthers exploded for an
1 1-2 lead behind victories by Bob
Simpson, Sean Moffit and Alan

Utter, and a draw by freshman
Steve Budman. The 2-0 victory
by Simpson came against Erik
Burnett, one of the top
sophomore wrestlers in the East,
and it bumped Simpson’s season
mark to 25-11.

After losing four of the next
five matches (the lone Panther
win was by Mike Toplisek), the
meet was tied at 14.

The final match of the evening
featured Clarion’s undefeated
heavyweight Kurt Angle (23-0-1)
against Panther juniorjoe Conlon
(6-17). The outcome decided the
meet. Angle, one of the best
wrestlers in the country, won a

Gymnasts Win; lose parallelist Miller

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers gymnastics team found that
success has its price after this past weekend’s
triumph at Trees Hall over the University of Rhode
Island Lady Rams (179.90) and the James Madison
University Duchesses (178.85) with a score of
182.80. .

The Lady Panthers suffered several falls and
small errors during the night’s competition, but

'3; \ they didn’t allow these setbacks to spoil their meet.

The Lady Panthers started out the meet with a
strong vaulting performance, giving them a score
of 45.85.

“Vaults were real nice,” said Pitt head coach
Debbie Yohman. “I was worried about vault,
because I was afraid vaulting scores would be
tight.” 9

Scores of a 9.0 and higher on vault were turned

in by Gina Venezia (9.30), Karenjorgenson (9.25),

Beth Dyson (9.1 5), Shelly Sleith (9.10), Tina Taylor
(9.05) and Kristen Brown (9.0).

The Lady Panthers started out the second event,
the uneven parallel bars, on the wrong foot when
Kim Miller, who scored a 9.0, injured her knee on
her dismount.

“I had sprained my [left] ankle a couple of days
ago,” said Miller, “I was trying to favor it a little bit,

' and when I landed, my [right] knee just went out.

I  rotated too much.”
Yohman added that Miller landed with her
weight off-balance onto her right leg.

As a result of Miller’s injury, Yohman has to
replace her routine with one of the other girls who
are practicing uneven parallel bars.

“We just lost a solid bar score; we’ve got to have
somebody else come in there," said Yohman. “We
have Hope [Celani] working bars, but she’s got to
stand up that dismount.” '

Celani has been competing exhibition on bars for
the past few weeks, during last weekend’s meet she
scored a 8.75 on the bars. I

, “Tina [Taylor] has been doing a heck of a job on
bars. It would be nice to get her into the all-
around,” said Yohman. Taylor had been suffering
from a loss of confidence, but she» has been
working her way back into the all-around one
event at a time. I

“I’m pushing for it [all-around]; I'm working on
my bars,” said Taylor. “Bars are my weakest event,
so they’ll probably be the last to come, but they’ll
be there.”

“Beth [Dyson] has been working bars too, and
that’s the extent of our bar lineup,” continued
Yohman, “We don’t have anybody else, so one of
those three [girls] working bars  will have to
replace Kim.”

Dyson has been working her way back into the
all-around competition after she received an elbow
injury during her junior year of high school.

“[My elbow] is doing fine now. It’s great  I'm
very happy with it,” said Dyson. “Today wasn't bad.
I do have room for improvement; I know where it
is. I feel like I'm coming back pretty strong.”

Bulls smzpfour-game losing streak at N. Y. 6

By Geoff Moskowitz

The Pittsburgh Bulls snapped a
four game losing skid this
weekend by beating the New

and Dave Pietramala each
contributed hat tricks to keep the
Bulls’ slim play—off hopes alive,
and increase the Bulls’ record to

Wilson, who missed the first
two games, was not an official
member of the Bulls sit the
beginning of the season, although
he was listed on the roster. He
has amassed 6 goals and 4 assists
in just 4 games, including an MVP
performance against the Saints.
Brian Nikula, who led the MILL in
goals scored and total points for

I the first three weeks of the season,

is a good friend of Wilson's and

pushed the Bulls’ front office to
make him a member of the team.
Both Wilson and Nikula are from

Gymnasts

Continued from page 8

The Lady Panthers opened the
fourth event with strong beam
routines to give them a 46.05 on
the beam. The Pitt squad turned
in scores in excess of 9.0 and
counted very few faults. Scores in
excess of 9.0 were turned in by
Taylor (9.35), Jorgenson (9.30),
Venezia (9.20), Dyson (9.20),
Sleith (9.15) and Brown (9.05).
Borchers received a fall on her
mount to the beam, but Yohman
attributed this to the fact that her
mount was new and was designed
to raise the level of difficulty in
her routinefrom a 9.8 to a 10.0.

“It's a very difficult mount, and
we’ve been for the past two or
three weeks wanting to put it in,
and we didn't feel it was ready
yet, ” said Yohman “ We felt it was
ready this week, and when you
add a new trick like that, there’s
a possibility you’re going to miss
it, because you’re nervous about
it.”

In the sixth and ﬁnal round of
the meet, the Lady Panthers

performed their ﬂoor exercises.
The Pitt squad’s scores were not
as high as they normally are.
They received a team score of
45.30.

“I was not satisfied with the
floor routines. Everybody can do
better ﬂoor routines than they
did. I don’t think it was the
endurance; I think maybe we just
got a little sloppy. Our ﬂoor
routines are much better.”

High scores for the Panthers
were turned in by Jorgenson
(9.30), Venezia (9.25) and Brown
(9.10).

This Friday the Lady Panthers
will be hunting down the Lady
Falcons of Bowling Green State
University. The meet is scheduled
for 7 p.m. at Trees Hall.

“I don’t have any idea of what
their scores have been like, but I
do know that every time we do
go against Bowling Green we
have a record- setting meet, and
Bowling Green does also,” said
Yohman.

McNeal

Continued from page 8
McNeal the advice to get an early
start in training. Shorter added 1 5
pounds during his time off, and
many credit that as a reason for
his success in the physical Big
East.

“I just told Chris to get on the
weights while he had the chance
before next season starts," Shorter
said, “and to get into pick-up
times in his spare time.”

In addition to his early training
for basketball, McNeal is getting
the jump in the classroom as
well. McNeal said he received
“about a 2.2 or 2.3 [QPA]” and 15
credits in his first semester. He’s
taking 13 more credits now and
plans to register for the spring
session.

Despite losing a year of
eligibility however, McNeal said
he wouldn’t necessarily abolish
Prop. 48 if given the chance.

“I wouldn’t say that I was glad
that I’m sitting out,” said McNeal,
“but I think it'll help me in the
long run."

“It doesn’t surprise me that
[Chris] would say that,” said Pitt
coach Paul Evans, “He’s a heady
kid, a smart kid."

McNeal describes his style of
play as similar to Shorter’s but
isn’t worried about whether he’ll
have to sit behind Shorter for a
year

“I think I’ll get some significant

playing time,” McNeal said. “I
don’t know if I'll start or anything,
but I'm not going to worry about

it.”

Styles and coming from Oak
Hill aren’t the only things that
McNeal would like to have in
common with Shorter.

“I want to be Big East Rookie of
the Year, just like Brian did [last
year].”

For this year however, McNeal
is not allowed to participate in
any official activities of the team
under Prop. 48’s guidelines. That
is, he can’t practice or travel with
the team and is not allowed to sit
on the bench at home games.

So McNeal watches games from
the student section, waiting
patiently and watching a team
that he hopes to contribute more
to next year than just cheers from
the stands. ‘

Bulls

Continued from page 8

Mark Gold is also coming on
strong. Gold, a former leader of
the now defunct Washington
Wave, is tied with Brian Nikula
for team points (20) and is among
the league's leaders.

The Wings received offensive
support from Tim Conway, Butch
Marino, Bill Wyker, Pat Hanley,
and Brendan Kelley. Each had a
goal against the Saints.

The Bulls continued their
physical rampage, and are leading
the MILL with 36 penalties for 94

minutes. Nikula, Pietramala, and

Kevin Forrester are all in double
figures. Forrester’s minutes
include a game misconduct for
fighting against the Philadelphia
Wings ‘at the Spectrum, January
13. Philadelphia’s Andy Wilson
was also ejected from the game.

The Wings will be in Pittsburgh

Saturday, March 3 for their second
clash with the Bulls. The Wings
won the first slug fest 11-8. Last
weekend, the Wings beat the
Baltimore Thunder, in overtime,
13-12. Both teams were
undefeated going into the contest.

In order for the Bulls to be
successful against the Wings, they
will have to, shut down scoring
powerhouses Brad Kotz and Chris
Flynn.
