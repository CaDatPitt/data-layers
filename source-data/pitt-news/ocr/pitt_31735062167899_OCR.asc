FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1970

By BOB GING

Staff Writer
“I really didn't expect to
win,” this second time stated

Harris Miller, Wednesday even-
ing after the SG election votes
had, been tabulated. The mo-
mentum of his campaign, Mill-
er explained to the Pitt News,
had ended with the first elec-

tion. "Because of the second
election. many people feel that
Student Government elections

are a farce anyway.“

When asked about his feelings
toward alleged violations com-
mitted by Cundra's party in this
election. he said that he probab—
ly wouldn‘t protest. but that he
would have to think about it. He
stated that some people he had
talked to had still not been per-
mitted to vote in this election.
and that "a lot went on that was
unfair".

Reflecting on the second elec- '

tion. Miller commented that less
people voted in this election
than in the last. and that many
of his supporters thought it use-
less to vote again. "The logic of

having a second election was ob-
viously fallacious. that is. sup-
posedly. people didn't vote in
the first election. because they
thought they couldn’t."

"The realdisenfranchise-
ment.“ he continued. "came in
the second election. because
psychologically. people felt that
after taking the time to vote in
the first election. it would come
to naught in the second.“

USC Wins ‘With 33 Votes

SC Election Contested  

By DON MARBURY
News Editor

In the second Student Govern-
ment election of'the year. Unit-
ed Student Coalition (USC) can-
didates. Steve Cundra and Lee
Clabots defeated Harris Miller
and Shep Goldberg. candidates
from the Student Community
Lfnion (SCLT) by the margin of
33 votes.

The election held Wednesday
in the Student union found a
total of 1517 votes being re-

corded with Miller having 742
and Cundra 775. The combined
total of both SG elections gave
Cundra the slight voting edge of
15 votes; 1591 to 1576.

This second election found
nearly 150 persons not voting
that voted in the first election.

The election is. still not com-
pletely over because immedi-
ately following the news that
Cundra had won. four students

I wish to thank all of those
students who took the time out
to support me in this election.

I consider my election victory
a victory for the grassroots stu-
dent body. Our appeal was to
students while our opponents
sought endorsements and sup-
port from organizations and the
cliques of the past.

  Hoelscher Outlines

°Trade-Off’Technique

By BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Dean Harold Hoelscher of the
School of Engineering is not one
of those who gazes at man's fu-
ture through a rose-colored cry-
stal ball. "We have) no hope of
meeting every challenge in the
world." the outspoken adminis-
trator bluntly asserts.

Despite his distaste for utop-
ian visions. Dean Hoelscher is
no prophet of despair. "We are
going to have to make some
very hard decisions." he admits.
but these can be made. he be-
lieves. if men learn the art of
making "trade-offs."

Chatting with a handful of
interested students in the Stu-
dent Union Supper Room Wed-
nesday. the balding thinker
sketched the dimensions of sev-
eral of man's problems. focusing
on the many difficulties which
plague underdeveloped nations
because he considers them clear-

er and more sharply defined
than those of industrialized
countries.

Dr. Hoelscher) began by ob-
serving that such problems as
food shortages. economic stag-
nation. and high population
growth rates cannot be easily
solved.

Hereditary protein deficien-
cies. for example. cannot be era-
dicated simply by providing
members of one generation with
sufficient protein. And the agon-
ies of famine cannot be mitigat-
ed by rushing supplies to coun-
tries incapable of distributing
them.

With sciences three laws of
thermodynamics as m o d e l_ s.

Dean Hoelscher formulated
three premises which suggest
the confines man must learn to
accept: (1) the total world is of
limited content: (2) human de-

-mands are fast outpacing the

world‘s supply: and (3) man
cannot assume that new break-
throughs in the art of problem-
solving will occur. »

The best available method of
coping with problems. accord-
ing to Dean Hoelscher. is that
of the trade-off. "We are going
to have to trade—off our ability
to do something in some areas
for our ability to do something
in other areas." In short. the art
of choosing among undesirable
alternatives must become polish-
ed.

Defining a trade-off as a
"conscious. willful. determined
choice of an undesirable action
which represents the maximum
obtainable." the eminent social
observer distinguished between
the "trade—off" and the "com-
promise" while the former to
him is an active. dynamic pro-
position. the latter is a passive
sort of gravitation towards the
path of least resistance.

Before entertaining questions.
Dean- Hoelscher emphasized
that he was particularly pleas-
ed to have had the opportunity
to speak with students about the
subject of trade-offs. since to-
days young people will even-
tually have to make the deci-
sions which will determine
man’s future.

“We have to begin today to
worry about tomorrow’s prob-
lems," he concluded. "Let‘s
worry together." ’

 

Since this is a victory for all
students. I wish to open up all
of the committees to all types
of students. no matter what their

political views or affiliations
may be. I also want students to
feel they can set up their own
ad hoc committees to seek sup-
port and find solutions to their
own problems. This will enable
Student Government to repre-
sent students and identify with
them.

..But I consider the major, im-
mediate problem to our Univer-
sity the financial dilemma
which we all face. I feel the
need to immediately vocalize
the students and the commun-
ity’s demands to force Harris-
burg to give us the money we
need to exist. I will not allow
the administration or Harris-
burg to pass the buck to stu-
dents by making them pay tui-
tions of $2000 or more per year.
so I will lobby here at the L'ni-

versity and. if necessary. in
Harrisburg to get the needed
appropriations for the L7niver-

sity‘s operating costs.

I also feel that we must solve
the problems of Student Govern-
ment restructuring. Within the
very near future. we will work
out a definite system to decide
student representation on the
University Senate. We will also
work for responsible curriculum
charges and reforms which are
needed to make our education
more valid.

But my greatest concern. in
the long run. is the fact that
Student Government is not re-
spected by the students. I am
displeased with the low voter
turnout when every attempt was
made to give students the oppor-
tunity to vote. But I consider

this small turnout to be the dir-

ect outcome of the failures of
past Student Governments. I
will work for student involve-
ment to fight this apathy. I will

‘try to make student representa-
_ tion legitimate and effective on

this campus through my actions.

I recognize though. that we
must work with Harris Miller
and the people who supported
him. because they. too. can con-
tribute much to Student Govern-
ment. But I and the members of
my party are happy that we won
after this grueling campaign.
and we are all anxious to get to
work.

tion Board. stating that Cundra

had again violated Election
Board Codes.
The students; Liz Ciavera,

Cindy Niklas. Jeff Zonis, ’ and
Fran Duffy charged that Cun-
dra had violated a rule of the
Board. which they said prohib-
ited a candidate keeping.‘ any
type of posters or campaign ma-
terial public during election day
proceedings.

The students said that they
had documented proof in the
way of pictures of Cundra scam-
paign posters still posted all
over the campus with a picture
of the Pitt News with the Wed-
nesday, February 4 election day
date.

The SG Election Board met
yesterday to consider the com-
plaint. but as of this printing no
decision has been announced.

In addition. 16 of Cundra's
candidates for senators were
elected to nine of Miller's. The
first election senatorial vote was
15 for Miller and 10\for Cun-
dra.

Crisis Calls For

Personal Action

By DAVE TIERNAN
Editor

Students interested in contact-
ing the State Legislators con-
cerning the current financial
crisis are urged to write person-
al letters or notes. rather than
send form. letters. Sources in
Harrisburg informed The Pitt
News Wednesday that form let-
ters are usually discarded.

In addition to writing to the
State Legislators. students are
urged to contact their parents
immediately and urge them to
write.too.

The Pitt News will publish a
special issue next week; explain-
ing the complicated series of
events that have led to the fin-
ancial crisis. Thus far. sources
have only indicated [that the
main reason the State won't ap-
propriate monies allotted in the
State budget for fiscal year 1970
is a shortage of funds and a
fear of introducing new tax pro-
grams to raise more monies in
an election year.

Fear that the State could pos-
sibly wait until anew Governer
is elected in November _to ap-
propriate monies to Pitt, Penn
State, Temple and The Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania has caused
many to believe that the Uni-
versities will be forced to either
raise tuition or close their doors.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
who will return from Africa next
week. will issue statements con-
cerning the University‘s future
plans ‘immediately upon his re-
turn. The Pitt News will report
those statements as soon as they
are made.

tors from Allegheny County are

400,000 Infant Deaths

by MIKE FLANAGAN
‘ Staff Writer

Professor Ernest J. Sternglass

‘of the Physics Department has

been in the national spotlight be-
cause of a frightening theory he
has recently developed. In nation-
al 'publications such as Science,
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
and Esquire, Professor Stern-
glass has charged that nuclear
fallout has caused‘ 400,000 infant
deaths in the United States since
1950.

pg Sternglass reached his figures

' _ by_ plotting the infant mortality

rate before, during. and after
atomic testing. From 1935 to the
beginning of atomic tests in/1950.
the infant mortality rate was as-
suming a constant decline. With
the beginning of atomic tests in
1950, the rate ceased to fall at the
1935-1950 rate and assumed a new

A -scale corresponding to A-bomb

_and H-bomb tests.

- In a recent interview. Dr. Stern-
glass revealed some interesting
facts.

Question. Is nuclear testing still
going an?

Answer. The French and Chin-
ese are still testing atomic weap-
ons, and although their atomic ca-
pacities are not extremely signi-
ficant now. they are growing at a

‘ ‘rapid pace. The United ‘States is

still testing underground in Alas-

 ka and is thinking of putting atom-
” ic energy to peaceful use with

what is known as the Plow Share
Program. The government would
attempt to build canals with atom-
ic explosions near the earth's sur-
face. This type of explosion would
allow /anywhere from 10 to 50 per

I cent of the radiation to escape into

the atmosphere. This radiation re-
mains in the atmosphere up to 1.-
000 years as the half life of carb-
bon 14 is 5.700 years and the half
life of strontium 90 is 28 years.

  Dearest Karen,
  tum
 nnv  

  

Q. What is your opinion of the

ABM? Do you view the decision to.

deploy it as dangerous.

A. If what I am saying contin-
ues to be confirmed. this is what
will happen in the event of a nu-
clear attack on the United States.
Ten to 10 thousand missles. each
carrying a two megaton warhead.
would be needed to shoot down all
incoming missles. The result
would be a release of 100 times
the fallout of all the atomic testing
done to date. Such a release would
kill one-half of all the children un-
der one year old. and due to gene-
tic damage. there may be no chil-
dren born at all. Any children born
would be either defective or die
young due to unspecified heart
valve diseases. In other words.
with the ABM defense in a nuclear
attack. the chances are that there
will be no future generation.

Q. What would you hope for, and
what do you expect from the Stra-
tegic Arms Limitation Talks?

A. My material has been used
at arms control talks between
Russia and United States‘ scien-
tists and they are very concerned.
A Russian scientist by the name
of Sakharov predicted that for ev-
ery megaton released in testing.
there has been 10.000 deaths. This
was released in 1958 and roughly
paralled by findings. I hope we can

come to an agreement with Rus-

stockpile of an estimated one mil-

must be reached as 200 megatons

PESO Supervisor

Encourages Grads

by MICHAEL R. EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

One need not be monetarily
minded to find it appropriate that
Mrs. June Rubel is coordinator of
PESO. the Post-Baccaulaureate
Educational Services Office. Any-
one who has never entered 1009 D
CL is immediately struck by how
well the native Pittsburgher fits
the profile of her position.

A graduate of Duquesne Uni-
versity and mother of two. Mrs.
Rubel left her post as supervisor
of the Department of Commerce
of the Pittsburgh Better Business
Bureau to work for the late Chan-
cellor. Dr. Edward Litchfield.
Later she became assistant to
Dean Richard L. Park of the Di-
vision of Social Sciences.

Among her activities outside of
her academic work. Mrs. Rubel
is a member of the advisory board
of the Pitt YWCA.

Graduate Study

Cooperating with the Universi-
ty Placement Office. the Counsel-
ing Center and the staff of the
Dean of Students Office. Mrs. Ru-
bel specializes in creating and
impll  snfing ideas to encourage
student to continue their educa-
tion beyond a Bachelors degree.
This is in line with Department of
Labor statistics which show a

growing trend toward continuing
education.

PESO offers an advanced ed-
ucation reading room complete
with card catalogue organized by
programs available for specific
areas of study. Mrs. Rubel helps
to identify. coach and encourage
Pitt candidates for such national
and international awards as the
Danforth. Fulbright. Marshall.
Rhodes. Woodrow Wilson and Na-
tional Science Foundation. PESO
also makes available applications
for advanced examinations and
collects letters of recommenda-
tion.

Recommendations

As early as his sophomore year.
a student can request professors
to send letters of recommenda-
tion to PESO. where the letters
are filed until needed by the stu-
dents. A duplicate of’ composite
letter is then mailed according to
the student’s request by PESO
secretary. Mrs. Theresa Jackson.
In this way. students are not fac-
ed with asking for recommenda-
tions from professors no longer at
the University or who may hardly
remember the student in question.

Mrs. Rubel also is the official
pre-law advisor at the University.

vises pre-medical students. Be-
cause most of the 758 students who
used PESO facilities during the
last school year lacked a sense of
direction. Mrs. Rubel has impli-
mented an experimental series of
career seminars. designed to
bring students into contact with a
wide variety of individuals fami-
liar with the opportunities and re-
quirements found in the commun-
ity. Such individuals can offer ad-
vice along the lines of “if I had it
to do over again.“
Major Decision Programs

At the request of the Liberal
Arts Cabinet, PESO went one step
further by encouraging a series
of informal Major Decision Day
programs sponsored by individual
departments to guide interested
students toward specific goals.

But despite these accomplish-
ments. Mrs. Rubel is not satis-
fied. "I want to bridge the gap be-
tween undergraduate experience
and graduate and professional ex-
periences towards a lifetime of
continuing education. Students
must be able to acquire the skills
they need to feel self worth. I can
help direct a students thinking.
but I can‘t make choices for him.
The problem is that students don t
have enough life experiences to
make a rational choice. I find that
most students who come to my of-
fice for help dont even know what
questions to ask."

Mrs. Rubel cited an article by
Virginia Joyce. entitled “Paper
Education" (Pitt News, Monday.
Jan. 12. 1970). as a case of the
growing realization of students
that undergraduate experience of-
ten lacks relevancy to the stu-
dents total life experience. "The
present system of education’ per-
petuates a merry-go-round of des-
pair and frustration." she
charged. “The student is disap-
pointed with himself and his in-
ability to fit into a society which
has deprived him of direction.“

helping students “clarify their
own aspirations” and "helping to
bring into focus the direction they

his dreams. Children dream, but
at we grow into adulthood. we
are forced to fit ourselves.into
someone else’s framework. We
lose sight of the dream or fail to
exercise our initiative to continue
the dream."

What is needed to alleviate this
situation? According to Mrs. Ru-
bel. the answer is a "Free Univer-
sity, where the student knows his
choices and is free to use his initi-
ative in his chosen direction.”

To achieve such a situation at
Pitt. undergraduate education
must include freedom to work
and or study in the community.
at other universities or cities in
America and. via new or existing
programs. an easily accessible
avenue to foreign study and work.

As Mrs. Rubel sees it. small
discussion groups consisting of in-
dividuals from the community and
the student body might lead to a
cooperative education program.
an old practice at some colleges.
which would help the student gain
skills in human relations and es-
cape the confing framework of
the present educational environ-
ment.

Furthermore. as a state-related
University. Pitt often attracts stu-
dents for financial reasons. rather
than because the program is ap-
propriate. An example is an ad-
visee of Mrs. Rubel’s interested
in marine science. If Pitt had co-
operative arrangements with
schools offering specialized

courses. such a student might be .

better able to prepare himself for
his career goal without transfer-

ing out of Pitt. Pitt might receive ‘

students as well who are interest-
ed in fields well developed here.

Finally, the same thing is true
of study abroad. While Pitt does
bring foreign students to study in
Pittsburgh. our students tend to
look at foreign study as a priv-
ileqige of the economic elite. To
Mrs. Rubel, foreign study pro-
vides the perfect opportunity to
learn about other people and their
cultures and informally learn lan-
guages while pursuing one’s sub-
ject of interest.

E dit or

“What can we do?” a girl on
the phone asked nervously.

“Why didn’t The Pitt News
. earlier?” a
‘sophomore asked me.

“Is it _really as bad as everyone

says?" an old friend asked me to-
day.
_. _.These questions came from stu-
dents whom have ﬁnally realized
the critical ﬁnancial state of the
University.

It took a long time for students

A to realize how bad the situation is,

andit wasn't until they were faced
with the hard, cold facts of a
possible “tuition increase or a
shut-dow.n that they decided to
"wake up and listen to the talk of

ﬁnancial indeptedness. Instead

of‘ blaming the students for‘ not
being aware, or blaming the Pitt
News for not making them

andits possible results.

!niversity’s Future Bleak;  
   S  Legislature’s  DelayiBlamed

Legislature has failed to
appropriate funds to the
University. These funds,-since the
University is State-related, are
necessary for the University to
pay its faculty, ad mi nistrators, and
15,000 employees (the University
is the largest employer in the city
ofPitts burg h).

The reason the State hasn't
appropriated the funds is
because it doesn’t have enough
moneytofulﬁllabudgetthatisn’t
cut from all possible angles.
Debate in the State Senate and
House changed from budget
cutting to further taxation and
back to budget cutting over the
past seven months. No action
resulted.

The main‘ reason no action
resulted is that this is an election
year. Reelection by an individual
or party that proposes additional
taxes, always an unpopular issue,
would be difficult.

Thus, the University will
ultimately suffer because of the
failure of the State Legislature to
act. Other interest groups, too,
have suffered, and will suffer in
the future.These are such groups
as Educational Television,

Libraries, Hospitals, Warrendale
School, and many others. These
groups, along with the University,
stand to receive drastic cuts: by
the State in their budget unless
more money is-praised by new
taxes.

But what is going to ‘l’i‘a‘p'pen‘

here at the University in the
future?‘

How are we going to be
affected by the Legislature’s

failure to act ‘I

In addition to the University
being forced to close its doors,
two possibilities exist.

First, the Universitycould raise
the tuition and maintain current
educational expenditures. This
raise would result in tuition
payments ranging from $2000 to
$3000 per year, with little or no
financial aid. This means no
academic or athletic scholarships.
In addition to many bright,young
students looking elsewhere for
their college education, the work
ofthe Athletic Departmentinthe
past few years will have all beenin
vain. The future dynasties of
Dave Adams, Jim Banner, Buzz
Ridl, and Carl DePasqua will
never be morethat dreamteams.

And ‘how many students
presently‘ enrolled could return
in the fall to pay $100 per credit
hourﬂ

The second possibility is for the
University to keep the tuition
where it is, but cut back so
drastically in faculty and graduate
assistants that classrooms with two
thousand students would not be
at all uncommon. students

would ultimately pay the price in
watered-down education, for
how many ﬁrst-rate professors.
would stick around to teach
thousands of students —
especially when they would have
to lecture, test, and grade the
students without the help of
graduate assistants, Soon the Un-
iversity. would be nothing more
than a large, low-rate college,
offering nothing more than the
basic courses needed for a
degree — a degree that wouldn’t
be worth much .more than the
paper on which it would be
printed.

Neither possibility offers a very
bright future for the University,
for either way, the students will
end up paying for the
Legislature’s delay.

As you know, despite concert-

, ed efforts by the leaders of both
political parties, the Legislature

of the Commonwealth of

_ ,'Pen,_nsylvania has been unable so
1. far to agree upon a tax package
which will provide sufﬁcient
revenue to meet the ﬁnancial
needs of the C o m m o n-
pwealth during the current fiscal

year. As a consequence. those
funds the state-related
universities (Penn State, Temple
and the University of
Pittsburgh) would receive for
the ﬁscal year that began lastluly
have not yet been appropriated
by the Legislature. A report ap-
proved by the University Senate
regarding the ﬁnancial problems
facing the Legislature and the
U niv ersity of Pittsburgh is
enclosed for your consideration.

The situation we fac e is
grave. Unless the Legislature can
ﬁnd a way very soon to provide

that portion of the budget for
Pitt and: the other state-
related ‘universities which it
normally supplies. we will be
forced to take drastic" action. To
replace the state tuition subsidy
and maintenance appropriation.
the University will be compelled
to increase tuition to at least
Sl.00O per term. At the same
time. many of our educational
programs will have to be cur-
tailed. and most student aid pro-
vided by the University with-
drawn. The only other alterna-

Sigh! S igh! Silent!

By VIRGINIA J OYCE
Edit orialEdit or

“Governments have always rested and, special
cases apart, must rest, if not on the affection, then
on the reverence or awe; if not on the active
approval then on the silent acquiesenee of the
numerical majority.”

These words were penned in 1889 by a British
Ambassador to the United States. The philosophy
behind them forms the basis for one of the most
widespread and well-swallowed deceptions that
has been dished out and believed by angaudience
inthe 20 years of my limited experience._

On November 3 of last year, President Nixon
informed his listeners in a nationally televised
address that “the silent majority” ofthe,American
“public” was behind him in his Viet Nam policy.

Well, the “public” may be behind him or
around him or above him, but his inference that a
majority supports him is a faulty premise.

Aequiescent majority is a more appropriate
term. (Acquiesence —— to accept or comply tacitly
or passively, without implying consent or agree-
ment; to regard as inevitable or indisputable).
Acquiesence to the Presidential will for the in-
dividual is the product oflongyears ofresignation
to authority. It is the “american way”.

From the time a child is weaned until he
reaches school age, he is confronted with the ab-
solute authority of his parents, who make his
decisions and “tell him what to do and how to do
it.”

Acts of rebellion and “deviate” independence
are rewarded by verbal or psychological punish-

ments. How many times is it said, “What do you
mean‘Whyﬂ’l’m your father.”fI'

The tradition of unquestioned authority is
buttressed in the schools.Teachers, for portions of
the school day, assume the parental role, laying
down the law with promises of failure, ridicule or
ostracism to those who dare to violate it.

— The child who seriously questions the govern-
ment of parent and teacher must overcome these
fears.

He begins to realize that objection doesn’t get

* him anywheregresignation is the easy way out and

the least painful.
He learns to acqniese.

But more than this happens. The ﬂedgling
voter, as he resigns himself to the authority of
accepted ﬁgures, drinks in the projected image of
his own inferiority. Because he accepts the rightful
authority ofconccpts,such as parcnt,teachcr, God
and country, he must admit toits veracity. ,.

This admission, however, is based on his own
impotence.

So how can the President deduce that “a
majority” supports him, a majority that has been
raised to acquiesce and not to affirm? Did a ma-
jority elect himll Did a majority send him tele-
grams ofapproval on his policies?

Does a majority really care when its members
have learned that the easiest way out has always
been to give in to -tlicrightcousness of concepts
that are greater than themselves? 1

Committee

Not "Yell0w”

Editor, Pitt News

On Tuesday. January 27th the
Winter Weekend Committee was
informed by the D.A.’s office
that it would not be permitted
to show the movie. "I Am Cur-
ious, (Yellow>." Some students
have accused the Committee of
"copping out" of a confrontation
with the D.A. This accusation is
not true.

It is the purpose of the Com-
mittee to make the Weekend en-
tertaining. If Mr. Dugan carries
out his threat to “bust” the show-
ing of the movie and confiscate
the film the students would stand
to lose, that is, no picture would
be show. Therefore, the Commit-
tee decided to substitute, "Elvira
Madigan” and “The Collector”,
two pictures of better quality
than. “I Am Curious. (Yellow)."

If a confrontation with “The
Man" is what the students want.
Winter Weekend is not the time
to do it. I am totaly in agree-
ment with those students who be-
lieve that the D.A. has no busi-
ness dictating what films we may
or may not see at this University.
Therefore Cincy Niklas and I do
not consider the matter closed.
We plan to take steps to show a
film at Pitt which will test Mr.
Dugan’s narrow view of morality.
Why should "The Man" be able
to tell us what movie we can
see? Are we not to be consider-
ed intelligent. mature adults‘?
Can't we discern for ourselves
the value. “I Am Curious, (Yel-
low)” has as a motion picture?

Lastly. some students will be
surprised to learn that the Admin-
istration. (Vice Chancellor Kobo-
sky. Dean Feig and Dean Peasel.
promised not to interfere with
the Committees decision. although
they thought showing the film
would do the University more
harm than good in terms of fund
allocations from Harrisburg. In-
deed. the above mentioned admin-
istrators were prepared to go to
jail if the Committee decided to
show the film.

I hope this has made the Com-
mittees position clear. We have
chosen not to make Winter Week-
end a physical confrontation with
the D.A. but this is not a "cop
out." Rather we would like to
look back at Winter Weekend
1970 and say that it was truly
the dawning of "The Age of
Aquarius." Peace!

Sincerely.

Election A Farce

Editor, Pitt N e ws,

Did someone mention
the word farscicalﬂ Did someone
mention meaninglessﬂ We ask
the Student body. what else can
the ﬁasco of Student Govern-
ment elections be termed. Last
week, the Elections Committee
prodded by the administration
and faculty invalidated an elec-
tion because only l650 students
out of a total of approximately
10.000 students voted, under the
guise that many students hadn‘t
received their invoices. Now.
with only I500 students voting.
Cundra is accepted as the
President of this ludicrous
organization. How can anyone
with any semblance of intelli-
gence accept these results as
valid. especially when for the
same reasons last weeks results
were termed invalid. lts incre-
dible, and only at this school
could something as preposterous
as this take place.

We are not blaming Cundra,
although his campaign was in-
ﬁltrated with illegal and irregular
tactics. but we are blaming you
the students -— the same ap-
athetic students who complain

about athletics but at the same ,

time refuse to support any team
at pep rallies. Whatthc hell is the
matter with you— Why Why
didn't anyone vote If this
election is any indication. then
Student Government should
most deﬁnitely be abolished —
Abolished not because it was the
ultimate pian of Harris Miller but
because You don't deserve a
Student Government. You don't
deserve anyone representing
you on any faculty committee, a
privilege which students now
enjoy.

As it appears today, Cundra
will take ofﬁce —— A student who
was elected with less than eight
per cent of the Student Body
behind him. If you the students
can accept this then you are all
beyond help. and I feel terribly
sorry for anyone — ANYONE,
even Cundar. for presiding over
suchafucked-upstudent body.

Bring Back Grades.’

Editor. Pitt News

At breakfast several mornings ago. I heard an opinion ex-
pressed by a fellow student which shocked me. The opinion was
that the University reached its "academic peak" in the Litchfield
era and is now going downhill. Looking around at some of the

events and attitudes of last term. it would seem that that student

is right.

Last term was a term of disillusionment over the inequities
of the grading system for nearly everyone. Students and faculty
alike seemed to feel that grades were not an accurate or just
measure of student ability. and they wanted change. However,
the impromptu changes instituted by some faculty and the atti-
tudes taken by some students about these changes cannot help
but devalue the academic regard of this University. Instead'of
acting to equalize the grading differences which exist between
different professors. and thus make grades a slightly better mea-
sure; some faculty have magnified this inequality bv the “auto-
matic A” and “self-evaluation A” procedures of last term. Such
procedures. besides making grading still more unfair to the stu-
dents of "olde guard” professors, have made Pitt the laughing
stock of its own students. This same procedure, while meant to
remove unnecessary grading pressure and free the mind to enjoy
learning. has for many students removed their only learning mo-
tive (I use the term “students” here loosely). It thus creates a
pseudo-student con-artist who takes “mickeymouse” and "blan-
ket'A’,’ courses only because of their grading, learns nothing,
and laughts all the way to the registrar’s office, dragging this
University’s reputation through the mud the whole way.

Thus. in my opinion, for these reasons, procedures such as
“self-evaluation” in courses should be banned from the Univer-
sity - Cary Hamlin

Tankers Return Home
As Favored Maryland

Invades Trees Pool

by JERRY MYERS

After a week of intensive preparation. the mer-
men have mobilized their forces to meet the attack
of the Maryland Terps, who will invade Trees Hall
tomorrow for their 2 o’clock meet.

The Terps comprise the strongest opposition
Pitt will face this season and this is the second year
in a row Maryland has had that distinction. Last
year the tankers from College Park splashed the
Panthers, 72-41, and played the meet "like gentle-
men.” This year the Terps will be back and the fact
that they have to contend with a stronger, deeper
Pitt squad may change their attitude to the compe-
tition.

Coach Bill Grant is well aware of the fact that
Maryland poses the greatest threat to the Panthers
rejuvinated ways. Pitt goes into the contest with a
two-meet winning streak and a chance to really give
the home town folks a top-flight show. Before they
do though. they'll have tojind a way to contend with
the all around depth that characterizes the Mary-
land squad.

According to-Coach Grant, “Maryland has six’

swimmers that could swim anywhere. Just take a
look at their times in the individual medley events.
Almost all of them are outstanding in this event re-
cording times around 2 : 04-2 :05.”

In comparison to those times it is significant to
point out that the fastest time recorded this season
for the individual medley in a Pitt meet was 2:08,
by a swimmer by the name of 0’Keefe from Buck-
nell. But more important it shows the versatility of
the Maryland swimmers. '

Coach Grant is moreiconfident about some of
the other events. “We can handle them in the div-

ting." he .commented. 9%).) e  been  better _

Wt i.»

   

than ever. He’s diving much better than he did at
this time last year. But on the other hand you can’t
depend solely on your divers. It’s not that hard to
come up with a bad dive.”

Grant admitted that Wessel has been having

very poor luck with the officiating. He believes that ’

Dave is diving between seven and eight every time.
Grant also is very pleased with the way Chester
Zientel has been diving this season. The tankers
shouldn't have much trouble in the diving events.

Dave Wessel commented, "Last year they com-
pletely dominated us, but I think we’ll give them
good competition this year. Maryland is definitely
the toughest team we’ll face all season.”

A few trends have developed after the first four
meets of this 1970~season. So far Al Morris has been
unchallenged in the 200 yard breast stroke and Rick
Rowe two firsts and twoseconds in the 200 yard but-
terfly. Out of the eight diving eventsiithat Dave Wes-
sel has entered, he has won seven of them and came
in second in the eighth. In addition Wessel has set
four new pool records-two at Penn State, one at
West Virgina, and one at Temple.

Another swimmer the hometown fans should
keep their eye on is sophomore Jim Hughes who has
swam the 200 yard backstroke event all season,
scoring in three of the four meets.

Maryland goes into tomorrow’s meet as heavy
favorites, but Coach Grant is confident that the mer-
men will make a meet of it. The Panthers follow up
the Terps with an away meet against Grove City on
Tuesday and then come back home next Saturday
against Youngstown. ‘

Meanwhile Pittsburgh fans will get a chance to
see one of the best teams in the East tomorrow at
Trees P901. . _ <  A

Schantz is also in contention for
the position. Saloky or Sherrif will
handle the chores at 177 and they
also have an equal chance of
wrestling at 190. Paul Allen is also
in the running for the 190 position.

Dave Young will wrestle heavy-
weight for the grapplers Saturday.

Adams predicts that Franklin
and Marshall will use Chris Black
in the 118 pound position. Black
maintains aI5-0 record. Black was

year.

At 126 John Hillaird will wrestle

the Field House a couple weeks
ago. '

The Cubs, too, have been think-
ing about tomorrow's game.

After the Cubs beat the C-MU
frosh Wednesday night Grgurich
mentioned that "they were think-
ing of the big one tonight."

Most coaches don't want their

players to think about future W

games, but the Cubs got away with
it against a weak C-MU squad.

The Cub ‘rebounding efforts
could be the important factor in
tomorrow’s game.

. Bill Sulkowski, the Cub center,
and Carl Morris have beengetting

the rebounds in the frosh’s latest
games, but the opposition hasn’t
had much height.

The Little Dukes are not as tall

as Grgurich’s crew, but they do ‘

come close. Center Dave Harring-
ton is 6’7” and forward Jack Woj-
dowski is 6’6”, compared to Sul-
kowski’s 6’8” and Morris’ 6'6”.

Duquesne schedules many of
the Little Dukes’ games as preli- -
minary encounters prior to the
featured varsity game. Tomorrow
night when the Big Dukes face
Providence, though. the prelim
stacks up as the important game.

The Pitt and Duquesne varsity
squads don‘t play each other and
many people have been crying to
for a meeting between the two

teams for a city championship. A

That..must mean that a Cub win
will rnakethem the city frosh.

Gymnasts Meet Navy,

Another High

by PETE N YCHIS

After a heartbreaking de-
feat to Temple at home last
Saturday Coach Neiger’s gym-
nasts will go on the road once
again, this time to Annapolis.
Maryland to take on the Mid-
shipmen of Navy.

Navy is similar to Temple
in many ways and the gym-
nasts will have their hands full
keeping up with the high scor-
ing Midshipmen. '

Navy has been scoring regu-
larly at the 148 point clip
against» its opponents but has
only a 1-3 record in the Eastern
Gymnastics League. Neiger’s
gymnasts have had only one
meet where they have scored
higher than 130.

Navy is exceptionally strong. in
each event with Mackey being
the leader. in all-around compe-
tition. He is capable of scoring
around 9.0 in every event. The
other strong gymnast for them is
Klotzwho specializes in the still
rings and parallel bars. Round-
ing out the rest of the team are
Rightmire and Getzlaff in the
floor exercise, Worthington and
Haring in the side horse, Klein
on still rings, and Ash on the
horizontal bar.

Nieger’s gymnasts have been
improving with every meet and
most of the improvement he con-

tributes to his assistant coaches ’

John Daller and Pat Dobson. He
said, “These guys have done a
tremendous job for me. There

The Pitt Basketball team will
invade the Civic Arena for the
third time’this year as they meet
Temple University on Wednes-
day February 11. Pitt‘s other
two appearances at the Arena
were in the Steel Bowl. For the
first time. they will be the host
at the Arena.

The University will provide
two buses to shuffle students to

 

 

Scorer

JOE GRACIK has been an outstanding performer for Warren Neiger’s

gymnasts all season long on the siclehorse. He suffered his lone de-

feat of the year last week in the Temple meet, butthe sophomore
has been scoring consistently in the upper eights and nines.

just isn’t enough to say about
them.”

He added. "I really appreci-
ate their assistance. They are
the ones who are highly respon-
sible for the improvement of
the team.”

On the trip south the gym-
nasts will have a smooth ride
but they might find the staying
a little rough. The losses for
Navy have come at the hands of
Eastern powerhouses Penn State,
Temple, and Springfield.

Neiger said, “We knowtwe’re
underdogs. They've been scoring
considerably higher than us and
we know we’re in for a rough
going."

Take You

the Arena for the game. The
buses will leave from the Tow-
ers and the Student ___Union on
the Fifth Avenue side beginning
at 6 p.m. Students will enter the
Arena at gate 6.

After the game, the buses will
return the students to the Uni-
versity. The buses will leave
from the same gate of the.Arena
and return to the Towers.

Neiger will also be missing»
, the freshmen for the trip and

will make it harder for the up-
iperclassmen since freshmen are
not eligible for this meet. The
coach said, “W_e’ll undoubtedly
miss the freshmen. We’d like to
have (Dave) Campbell on high
bar and (Frank) Swift on rings.”
He added, “We can’t forget Dick
Pribis who can help us on cer-
tain events, especially the floor
exercise.” I

After Saturday’s loss to Tem-
-ple, the gymnasts’ record stands
at 2-3. .

The Slippery Rock encounter
formerly scheduled for Wednes-
daynight has been moved up to
Tuesday night at 7 :30 p.m.

To Arena

Admission to all students will
be free with an ID. card. Pitt
has one win and one loss on the
Arena floor and both the players
and the coaches hope there
will be a large crowd on hand to
root for the team. The buses will
-practically make it effortless
for all students to attend the
game.

260 scores. John Toucher shot

the finest 440 yard hurdlers in
the world. Meanwhile. Smitty
will get his shot at Larry James
in the IC4A‘s later this year.

Bryant Salter will again be in
a high jump field which includes
three or four seven foot jumpers
and Banner is confident that
Salter will soon clear seven feet
himself. '

“Most of the jumpers haven’t
been going higher than 6’8” or
6’10” so far this season explain-
ed Banner. Salter keeps working
at clearing seven. He’ll make it
one of these times. I’m confident
of that.”

Doug Degenhart and Bill Kal
chalter will be competing in
their first invitational tomorrow
and both will be in very tough
fields. Degenhart will be going
up against several 16 foot pole
vaulters. while Kalchalter will
compete against a pair of Olym-
pians in the hurdles. Irv Hall.
formerly of Villanova. and Leon-
Coleman are the favorites in the
hurdle event.

Both the mile and two—mile
relay teams will run tomorrow.
and the two—mile quartet will be
out to defend its championship
from last year. Greg Rodgers
will replace Mike Nolan on the
two—mile team. as Nolan is still
