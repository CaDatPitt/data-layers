UNIVERSITY OF ‘PITTSBURGH .

and Frances Sansig
The Pitt News I

It's no secretthat the underage
drinking problem in Oakland is
a reality.

The problem was serious_
enough to receive in-depth cover-
age by The Pittsburgh Press sever-
al weeks ago.

Many students are under the
impression that all one needs to
be admitted to any of the bars in
Oakland is an acceptable fake ID.

According to Mike Franklin,
manager of Zelda's, ”Friday and
Saturday evenings are the most

SGB will  
sponsor
lecture on
aidcuts

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

The Student Government
Board will be sponsoring a talk

I by Robert Crowell,‘a democratic

state representative next Thurs-
day evening on the state's pro—.
posed education budget cuts_.
The talk is part of a series of
events the SGB is planning in

hopes-of informing the Pitt stu- V

dent body about both federal and
state cuts in the education
system.

SGB President Phil Moyer said
the cuts may affect approximate-
ly 70 percent of the student body.

Moyer also reported at the
weekly meeting yesterday that he
has contacted local police about
forming a crime watch on cam-
pus, and that the watch is in its
initial stages of developement.

He commended the allocations
committeefor their work in get-

ting budget requests through

committee, and reminded the
board of the appeals process
which will begin nextweek.

Therese McFadden said she
had spoken with Terry Milani,
acting director of student activi-
ties, about what hours the Wil-
liam Pitt Union is open for use by
the student population.

McFadden said Milani told her
the building is open according to
the needs of students, and that no
complaints about the hours had
been reported to him.

She said she also checked with
representatives of the Hillman

hectic nights with minors trying
to get in.”

Zelda's will accept a driver's
license or an LCB card. An ex-
pired ID is accepted only if it has
expired within a month or if the

' student has a reasonable excuse,

such as living out of state.

In an effort to crack down on
this problem, Zelda's has a
policeman check IDs every
Thursday night. He will confis-
cate any fake IDs he comes
across.

The Sanctuary, another local
bar, recently re-opened after be-
ing shut down for‘LCB violations.
Now it only accepts driver's

licenses and birth certificates that
are accompanied by a photo. Ex-
pired IDs are not accepted.

”You try to do your best not to.
let minors in, but some will get
in,” said Mike Travers, a bouncer
for the Sanctuary.

Travers said that when he en-
counters a fake ID, he will only
keep it if the person submitting it
is too persistent. If they are not
pushy, he will return it with a
warning not to come back.

According to Joe ‘Watkins, a
bouncer at Peter's Pub, Peter's
doesn't have much trouble with
minors as a result of tight security.

”Driver’s licenses are accept-

ed, and passports for the foreign
students are also OK.“ LCB cards
aren't accepted.

”One reason for very tight
security is that we don't need the
hassle. We can get the crowd in,

and it cuts down on the fights,” -

said Watkins.

Peter's Pub closed for seven
weeks on an LCB mandate for
serving minors. ' .

According to an underage fe-
male Pitt student, who asked to
remain anonymous, she has been
barred from several bars using her
false ID.

did Peter's, but only on certain

Greeks stuff it down at Greek Week Gorge

Library who told her that students
generally use the building as a
study area rather than for
research. She said they told her

that the library completed a study

on use of the building two years
ago and proposed at that time
that David Lawrence Hall be
used as an alternate all-night
study area.

McFadden said nothing further
had been done concerning the
matterlsince the submission of
the report, and that she would be
giving further attention to the
matter. -

It was reported that the board
is looking into a taxi service to
take place of the proposed escort

service. The freshman council
reported that of 64 persons polled
47 preferred a taxi service to the
escort service.

Board member George Kontos
reported that he had contacted
the Yellow, Peoples and Coloni-
al Cab Companies to determine
if any of the three were able to
provide the service. He said that
Yellow informed him that it
would be possible, and the other
two had not yet officially
responded. He suggested the best
method to determine which com-
pany to use would be to bid the
project out to the companies and
wait for a response.

The freshman council also‘

reported that in a poll of 75 stu-
dents, 63 would go to an SGB_

North fails in bid to stop counsel's investigation

WASHINGTON — A federal
judge on Thursday dismissed a
suit by Lt. Col. Oliver North that
sought to stop an independent
counsel's investigation of his cen-
tral role in the Iran-Contra affair.

U.S. District Judge Barrington
D. Parker said North's contention
that the office of independent
counsel is unconstitutional was
premature.

”The plaintiff has not suffered
an injury of sufficient keenness to
warrant the court's intercession,”
Parker said. ”For that reason, the
court finds that [the] plaintiff’s
challenge to the constitutionality
of the independent counsel
machinery is not ripe for adjudi-
cation and that his complaints
should be dismissed.”

Parker said the nation needs
”an expeditious and complete
disclosure of our government's
involvement in the |ran—Contra af-
fair” and said that independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh ”is
pursuing the investigation ener-
getically and responsibly.”

The presidentially appointed
Tower commission said in its re-

  
  

cent report that North was heav-
ily involved in both the secret
arms sales to Iran and in supplies
for the Nicaraguan rebels, who
are known as Contras.

Donor organ located
for larvik recipient

PITTSBURGH — A 57-year-old
Somerset County man received a
human heart at Presbyterian-
University Hospital Thursday af-
ter surviving 13 days with a
mechanical heart implant, said a
hospital spokeswoman.

H. Jack Landis of Cairnbrook
entered the operating room at
3:15 a.m. after medicial officials
had located a donor organ, said
the spokeswoman, Chris Shirer.

A team of doctors led by Robert
Hardesty finished the operation at
9:15 a.m., and Landis was in crit-
ical condition, which is normal,
she said. Details about the donor
were withheld by the hospital.

Landis, an independent brick
layer who is married and has two
daughters, was the 13th patient to

Astronomers discover
largest known galaxy

WASHINGTON — Astron-
omers peering past clouds of gas
and the glare of starlight say they
have discovered the largest
known galaxy — a giant spiral of
stars 13 times as big as the Milky
Way.

The galaxy, located 300 mil-
lion light—years from Earth in the
direction of the constellation An-
dromeda, is an oddly shaped
mass of stars and gases that puts
out tremendous amounts of ener-
gy, said a report to be published
Friday in the journal Science.

Researchers say the galaxy,
called Markarian 348, is 1.3 mil-
lion light-years in diameter. The
Milky Way, in which the Earth's

solar system is located, is about
100,000 light—years in diameter.

Kremlin says charges
are mere speculations

MOSCOW — The Soviet
Union detonated an underground
nuclear explosion Thursday, the
second test in the two weeks
since the Kremlin ended a
19-month halt in nuclear
weapons testing.

At the same time, a Kremlin
spokesman rejected as ”specu|a-
tions and outright lies” American
charges of Soviet cheating on
arms accords.

But the spokesman, Boris D.
Pyadyshev, expressed optimism
that the superpowers could soon
agree to rid Europe of their
medium—range missiles. He said
Soviet envoys to the Geneva arms
talks had been told ”to work for
agreement in the shortest time
possible.”

The underground nuclear ex-
plosion in Soviet Kazakhstan was
the second since Feb. 26 when
the Kremlin ended the test

Free chickens ruffle

feathers on highway

WASHINGTON, Pa. — A
broken strap on a tractor—trailer
sent crates containing several
thousand chickens onto Interstate
70, where hundreds of the birds
were killed in traffic, and the sur-
vivors wandered beside the road.

’’It was just like a movie ..
feathers flying everywhere,” said
state trooper Ted Davis.

A carpet of feathers and car-
casses covered the two west-
bound lanes after the 4:30 a.m.
mishap. A work crew from a local
towing company was called to
round up the surviving birds and
to clear the road with shovels.

’’It must have looked like a
chicken avalanche,” said Davis.
”Fortunately no one was hurt.”

 
Correction

It was incorrectly reported in the
March 11 issue that the CMU student
senate would not apologize to the
Student Union in writing for cutting
off funding. They do, in fact, intend
to do 50.

Student finds a different USSR

By Oeborah Kaufman
Staff Writer

Not many students get the
chance to travel abroad during
their college years. The number
of American college_ students
who get the opportunity to visit
the Soviet Union is even smaller.

Last November, Pitt senior Kris
Witherow got that chance when
she traveled to the city of Odes-
sa, one of the 10 ports of call
madegby the SS Universe during
its fall voyage. Her experiences
there led her to rethink many of
her opinions about the Soviet
Union.

Witherow described Odessa as I

a port city with a European flair;
she felt ’’almost at home” during
her four—day visit. However, her
experiences were quite different
from the other Semester at Sea
students who chose to visit Lenin-
grad or Moscow instead of re-
maining in Odessa. '

Witherow explained that
Leningrad and Moscow tend to
attract more American tourists.
Many of the students there were
approached by black marketeers
who were interested only in the
American products they had for
sale. ”Everybody wanted to buy
their jeans,” she said.

In Odessa, Witherow had the

opportunity to meet Soviet col-
lege students and to sit in on

some English and German class-
es at Odessa University.

She explained that since the
students don't have to work to
support themselves — a college
education is free — they seem to
concentrate more on their
studies. ”I tried to convey to them
that we have to pay for our
school, and it's expensive,”
Witherow said.

During her visit to an English
class and while touring Odessa
with her Soviet friends, Witherow
had the opportunity to speak
openly with the students and to
answer their questions. She said
that her reception was warm —
that everyone was interested in
what she had to say.

In discussing politics, she
”didn’t get the impression that
Soviets resent Americans, but
they found it hard to understand
why we'as Americans don't want

.to stop the arms race.” The fact

that Gorbachev’s third unilateral
proposal to stop nuclear testing
went unanswered by the Ameri-
can government embarrassed
Witherow. ”They don't want a
war,” she stated.

Her Soviet friends pointed out
that if a third of the Soviet budg-'
et weren't spent on defense, it
could be re-invested into the
country's needs, for food or for
education.

During her visit, Witherow had

the chance to go to an_ outdoor
market and to a department store.
She said that the selection was
limited when compared to Amer-
ican standards. There were no
bright colors, and the merchan-
dise appeared to be of a lower
quality than what Americans are
used to. I

”I didn't see lines of people
waiting to buy food. There may
be limits on it, but they aren't
starving,” she said. ”Their physi-
cal needs are taken care of— and
beyond that.”

She also stated that ”selection
is relative, anyway. Americans
have a hard time dealing with the
concept of havinga choice or too
many choices. We're bombarded
with the number of products
available here, so we might have
a hard time in the Soviet Union
because they just don't have that
large [of a] selection.”

A point that Witherow stressed
was that people tend to draw too
many parallels between the two
superpowers. ”Of course you'll
make comparisons,” she ‘said.
”But you can't compare the qual-
ity of living to [that of] the United
States.”

She thinks that people who
have been to the Soviet Union
tend to concentrate on the disad-
vantages — on what the people
don't have —— rather than on what

Oakland doesn't

need more hassle

_ Over the past two years there have been four proposals to
build new hotels in Oakland. No. 4, the latest one, is slated
to be built on what is now the parking lot behind the Masonic
Temple. . g

I There are 158 parking spaces on that lot. The buildingof this
hotel will mean 158 more cars trying to find parking in an al-

ready hideously overcrowded neighborhood. Quite simply, it's.

an inane idea.

The people who live in the neighborhood have formed a
group called the Schenley Farms Civic Association, which is
fighting the construction of the hotel. The city planning com-
mission held a meeting on Tuesday that was attended by mem-
bers of the Schenley Farms Civic Association. In order to hear
the arguments‘ of both sides, the planning commission decid-
ed to hold a meeting on March 24, which will be devoted en-
tirely to this issue. . —

Building a hotel complex of the size proposed by the Na-
tional Development Corporation is ridiculous. This hotel is
going to be nine stories tall and will have 199 rooms. Central

_ Oakland just cannot handle the additional people and traffic.

- It's true that Oakland is lacking in hotel space. It's also lack-
ing in parking space. Out-of-town visitors can stay in town or
in suburban‘ hotels and come to Oakland by cabs or bus. Those
who work and live in Oakland don't always have that option.

I If the National Development Corporation feels that Oakland
is in dire need of a-hotel, then why don't they explore the logi-
cal alternatives for the sight of their hotel — such as the area
along the Boulevard of the Allies in South Oakland or maybe

evengthe largest waste of space in the city, the Cathedral lawn? 4

Building a-hotel on the Cathedral lawn is a bit extreme and,
_with all sarcasm aside, it makes a valid point: central Oakland
is too developed. Right now, is Oakland, or the city of Pitts-
burgh for that matter, suffering for lack of hotel rooms? That

" . may have been the case a few months ago, but. since the new

Vista International opened downtown, the dilemma has been
solved. .

Everyonemakes an

occasional mistake

It seems as if the Black Action Society_is having some difficulty

figuring out exactly who won the elections they held on Mon-

day. -Apparently, those who were working the voting booths
didn't check everyone’s’BAS membership card.

The election committee destroyed 147 votes before they were
counted in order -to rectify the problems encountered on vot-

‘ing day. The results of the election were determined from the

remaining votes.
The BAS Election Committee used faulty judgment in this

, case. The elections are invalid. Should the two defeated ca_n—

didates file formal protests, The Pitt News intends to support
them. - ’

To make a mistake is not criminal, but mistakes should be
corrected whenever possible. The BAS should hold another
election. . A

If a second election is to be held, BAS Election Committee

3 members must stress to the poll workers that only BAS mem-

bers are allowed to vote in the election.
should be checked.
Hopefully, the ‘BAS has learned a lesson.

Generous endowment

causes many problems

Q. My lover and I are thinking
of getting married, and one thing
is holding him back. He is larger
than I can accomodate in a
relaxed frame of mind. I realize

' ‘(and he does, too) that sex,isn’t

all of marriage, but this bothers
me. Oral sex has never been a
problem for me until now. How
can I get past this barrier and on
with a wonderful life with him?

A. I take it that you mean that
his penis is too large for you to
have comfortably (in some sense)

in your vagina. It may be uncom-‘

fortable, or even painful, or just
the thought of its size makes you
tense up. As a general rule I tell
people that most can fit together
sexually but, of course, there
must be exceptions to the rule,
and your lover may provide one
of these. Well, that need not keep
a loving couple from marrying,
but it might be a real obstacle.
If you communicate well
together, I think you can let him
know in some friendly way that
you have a problem with his size,
perhaps saying, ’’It is on a heroic
scale, and I am not a heroine,”
or something tactful that shows
you see a good side of his being

so generously endowed. Perhaps‘

you should discuss this matter
with you gynecologist. (If you
can't discuss this comfortably
with your gynecologist I think
you have the wrong one!)

I don't know whether you

 

WEFSTHEIMER

should tell your lover that you.

mean to discuss his size with a
doctor. He might dislike the idea
that you are going to base a de-
cision on someone’s advice. In
any case, the gynecologist can
reassure you or might, in some
rare circumstances, advise you
against having intercourse. I feel
pretty sure that the advice would
be encouraging, however.
When a couple makes love
with the woman on top, she has
more control of the depth of
penetration. You might find that

this not only gives you control .

but a sense of security that will
release you from much of the ten-
sion you feel.

It might be that as a couple you
may rely mostly on other forms
of sex play, stimulating or ”p|eas—

uring” each other often by means
other than intercourse and saving
intercourse for now and then or
for achieving pregnancy.

I think you need to read some
reliable books on sexual perfor-
mance, such as The /oy of5ex by
Dr. Reuben, published by
Crown, that will aquaint you with
the variety of of sexual pleasur-
ing and not only the permissable
things to do but the mutually kind
and playful moods in which they
can be done.

If you have some attitude
against oral-genital sex, to use a
more descriptive term than ”oral
sex,” or some fear of it, or dislike
for some part of it, neither you
nor your partner should be un-

happy to put this aside for the-

time being at least.

No one has to do oral sex
when he or she has something
against it (and both men and
women have moods when they
don't want it or can have deep-
seated feelings against it). This is
no obstacle to sexual happiness
because there are so many things
people can do together sexually
without harm.

When one partner is urging
oral sex and the other resisting,
I tell them, ”For now, let this go.
Don't make an issue out of it. It
need never be done, and you can
still have great sex. And who
knows -— in six months or a year
feelings may have changed."

THE PITINEWS, Friday, March 13, 1937

For $500,000, I would pose in the nude

You're Fawn Hall. Penthouse
magazine has offered you
$500,000 to pose nude for the
magazine. Do you take the
money and remove your clothes?

This isn't some hypothetical
question. Fawn Hall — the form-
er secretary to Lt. Colonel Oliver
North of the National Security
Council — has been offered
$500,000 from Penthouse. Hall,
you will recall, has disclosed that
she altered memos and destroyed
documents at North's request.

Penthouse has confirmed that
it is- ready to pay Hall the
$500,000. Playboy wants to get
into the bidding, too. There have
been reports that Hall has already
turned down the offer. One of her
friends told the Los Angeles
Times that Hall thought Pent-
house's offer was "disgusting."

But think about it — $500,000.

How many times in a person's.

life does a chance for $500,000
come along?

I asked a group what they
would do ifthey were Fawn Hall.
Most of the women said that they
wouldn't appear in Penthouse,

On a fine winter day about four
years ago, I was walking through
the Towers lobby. Student groups
are always setting up booths of
some sort, and that day was no
exception. The group on this par-
ticular day was Mortar Board,
and they were giving out informa-

.tion on organ donation and con-

vincing people to sign organ
donor cards.

I stopped to read some of their
literature, and I signed a donor
card. I put it in the back of my
wallet, and I never thought much
about it after that day.

A good friend of mine had ‘a
kidney transplant three weeks
ago. I spent some time with her
last weekend, and it is wonder-
ful to see her getting better. She's
still not quite back to her old self,
but at least she's home and has
a working kidney.

The events of the past three
weeks have made me think about
the yellow card I carry in the back

even for $500,000. Most of the
men said that — if they were
women — they would take the
money and do it.

Some sample comments from
the group:
- 0 From one woman: "It’s too
sleazy. I'd have the $500,000,
but my life would be ruined. For
the rest of my life, I would be
remembered for posing nude for
that scummy magazine.”

0 From one man: "-Hell, yes.
I'd take the money, pose for the
pictures, and you'd never see me
again. I'd never have to work
another day in my life. I'd invest
the’$500,000 and live off of the
interest. Anyone could say any-
thing they wanted to say about
me — I'd be retired.” ~

°iFrom another woman: ”It

would be very tempting. I'd be e

concerned about how I would
look in the magazine. The idea of
millions of strangers looking at
me with my clothes off would
make me very uncomfortable.
But $500,000 would set me up
for life. In the end, I don't think

Give someone. a

of my wallet. In fact, I've been
thinking about it so much that
I've had it laminated.

My friend ‘Donna tells a pretty
harrowing story about her wait
for an available donor kidney. Be-
ing placed on a waiting list must
be absolute hell. Such a list

doesn't guarantee anything but .

anxiety.

Organ waiting lists are a part of
many people's lives — months
and months spent waiting for the
phone to ring. That call‘ comes for
many of them, but there are al-
ways cases where it doesn't. The
demand for organs far exceeds
the supply. Not because there ar-
en't kidneys, hearts, livers, lungs
and corneas, but because not
enough people carry the donor

cards and not enough families.

will agree to donate the organs of
a deceased loved‘ one.

Our society admires and re-
wards people who do nice things
to make the world a better place.

 

 

BOB GREENE
 
I'd do it. I'm glad I'm not Fawn
Hall. I'd hate to have to make that
decision."

0 From another man: "It would
be-very foolish not to take the
money. In six months nobody is
going to remember who Fawn
Hall [is]. She's got this one
chance in her life to pick up
$500,000. Yesterday she was a
secretary, and tomorrow .she
could be a wealthy woman. I
think she should do it."

From Penthouse's point of
view, it wouldn't even cost the

magazine anything. Penthouse
would pick up in the additional
newsstand sales at least
$500,000. There would be -no
financial gamble at all.

The intriguing thing, of course,
is how all of this came to be. Hall
made exactly one appearance.
She stepped out of her attorney's
office in Washington for a brief
photo session, at which she an-
swered a few innocuous ques-
tions, none of them having to do
with the substantive matters of
the Iran arms sale affair. She was
very pretty; her likeness appeared
on that evening's network broad-
casts and in the next morning's
newspapers.

And — boom! — because of
those briefmoments on the door-
stop of her attorney's office, she
is suddenly worth $500,000 to
Penthouse. A better question, of

course, is why so many people

would want to see her with her
clothesoff. You'dthink we'd be
beyond that by now -— after 30
years of men's magazines featur-
ing nude women, you'd assume

 

the sight of yet another undressed
female would not be all that
different. Penthouse is probably
right, though; if Hall posed, there

would be a stampede to buy the-_

magazine.

In the end, Hall will probably
get the money without having to
remove a stitch. I spoke with
several New York literary agents,

‘each of whom said that they

thought they could get Hall a
book deal for at least $500,000
— that's not including eventual
paperback rights and movie or-
mini-series sales. '

So the betting here is that Fawn"
Hall — yesterday's secretary —
will end up tomorrow's "author,"
with someone else taking her
thoughts and translating them
into a book. Her refusal of the
Penthouse offer will make her-

even a hotter commodity on the ‘

literary and talk-show circuits.

'And,every time she ste‘ps‘out of I

the shower she can look in_the
bathroom mirror and think:
"Gee. Half a million dollars, and
I said no." ’

chance to experience life

PAIII. ANTI-\'l'ER

We spend our whole lives ‘trying
to be charitable, yet why do so
few perform a final act of kind-
ness so that someone else may
live after we die?

This topic is one that makes
people squeamish sometimes. It
is kind of morbid; most people
don't want to think about their
deaths. But organ donation isn't
about death, it's about life.

    

My friend Donna is alive right
now because someone some-
where had a card in his wallet
just like the one I have. I feel
good» knowing that if anything
should happen to me, someone
else will be granted a new lease
on life— someone like Donna,

or any of the kids in Children's,‘

or any of the adults in Presby,
someone you know or perhaps
even you.

The frontiers of medical
science are being pushed back on
an almost daily basis. We have
things called laser‘ centers, sono-

grams provide pictures to proud

parents while their child is still in
utero, and there are people who
have been kept alive with artifi-
cial hearts. Pretty amazing stuff.

Organ transplants are equally
amazing. They differ from other

medical advances only in their-
dependence on public support. It '

would be difficult to perform
such procedures if no one would

donate organs. As it is now, the
concept of organ donation gets a
lot of lip service, and that's about
it. There just aren't enough peo-
ple who are willing to sign those

little yellow cards, and that is a '

shame.

It isn't just little yellow cards
._anymore either. When you
. donate blood and the blood bank

sends you a little white card with
your blood type on it, there's a
space on the back where you can
indicate your willingness to be a

- donor. Rumor has it that the new

Pennsylvania drivers liscenses
have the same deal. That's
progress, but it still isn't enough.

Think about this issue. Obtain-
ing a card requires very Iittl'eef-
fort. Keeping one in your wallet
requires no concentration and
doesn't cost a cent. Why not
demonstrate your willingnessto

I help? Ifyou need, an organ trans-
_ plant someday, you'll be. glad

someone else did.

Keeping up withthe Joneses while working out  

It used to be that all one need-
ed to get into shape was a VCR
and a Jane Fonda videotape.

Soon people realized that
working out in the living room
could be dangerous. One-two-
three-thud. One-two-three-oh-no-
not-the-coffee-table. And what if
someone should enter the room
while you are working out, par-
ticularly-while you are pumping
your pelvis toward the television?
How embarrassing.

Jane finally fizzled, and every-
one fled to fitness centers to get
into shape. .

How complicated these fitness
centers can be. Don't even think
about working out without bring-
ing along fingerless gloves, wrist
straps and a weightlifting belt.
Better to stay away from the
Lifecycle unless you can decipher
the dots and digits that light the
dashboard. _ .

Actually, it's not that bad if you
know what-to do and what to
wear. From first-hand experience

and what's out, depending on

' your perspective.

LYCRA PANTS — And you
thought Speedo suits were bad.
These form-fitting pants challenge
Michaelangelo with their ac-
curate presentation of the male
anatomy. I

HEADBANDS —— To think that
cutting the blood supply to your
head would actually "improve
cardiovascular fitness. Head
bands come in all colors and
fabrics, but be wary of those
Rambo red bandanas. Rambo
reds groan and grunt whenever
they move a muscle. Even when
they tie their shoes.

TORN CLOTHING -— It's not
difficult to tell who is really in

have ripped a perfectly good T-
shirt to shreds. I
There are four stages to this
ritual: cutting slits beneath both

WEARING SHORTS OVER
SWEATPANTS — This is some-
thing I will never understand. .

MIRRORS — Forbes Fitness
Center is an egotist's paradise.
Mirrors 4 feet tall on nearly ev-
ery wall. Everybody waits in line
to see how their b|ood—bloated bi-
ceps look while they sit in the
Nautilus machines.‘The real rea-
son for these mirrors is so you can
check out everybody’s Iycra

According to legend, some
clubs install two-way mirrors so
the instructors cancheck out your
lycra pants during lunch breaks.
Better be careful. ' ‘

TANNING BEDS ~— You might
as well cast a dark reflection in
all those mirrors. Again, be care-
ful. All those laboratory rats with
cancer. Why would laboratory
rats want suntans anyhow?

MAXING OUT —- The idea is
to lift as much weight ‘as you can;
then compare maxes with every-
one else at the club. That's worth
a hernia, isn't it?. _

Incidentally, maxing out
should not be confused with Rax-
ing out, the hip term for finishing
your workout with an all-you-
can-gorge salad bar at Rax.

NO COLLARS — This has
nothing» to do with torn clothing;
rather, it works hand-in-hand
with maxing out. There must be
some reason why weightlifters re-
fuse to anchor the-plates with me-

tal collars when lifting heavy
weights. There isno time more

 tenuous thanwhen ‘someone is

maxing out without collars.

JEWELRY —- If you are too lazy t_

to remove your jewelry while lift-

ing or tanning, that's fine, but - 1

don't wear anything gold into the
sauna. Gold quickly becomes

very hot when heated at 180-,»
degrees, especially when. some

dodo splashes the hot rocks with

an entire bucket of water.
SHOWERING — Shower eti-

quette dictates that you warn

everyone else when you are turn-)0  
ing on or off the water or flush‘-. . -

be a limited hot-water supply
shared by four spickets, two
sinks, two urinals and two toilets.

When the toilet is flushed, all

the cold water rushes there, just I

like at home. One crucial distinc-

tion: At home you scald your lit- 4
tle brother in the shower; at . '

Forbes Fitness Center you scald
four men who press 350 pounds
apiece. _
Which reminds me, Iforgot to
go back and flush the toilet after

eworking out this morning. Oh
well. " ‘ - I

Many students said they feel
that the $36 required student

will not benefit from the program.

Sophomore Susan Koslof said,

”I should not have to pay the fee _

According to Frank Carter,
director of Student Health, the
service is beneficial to all
students. .

”We need the fee from every-
one because it supplies the
resources to create and continue
a level of services for all stu-
dents,” said Carter.

~  -“pledging prospective members

a page of the newspaper, was one
of the longest and most detailed
on prostitution to appear in the
Soviet press. Authorities and
previous reports in the official
media have concentrated on
criticizing prostitutes who earn
hard currency from foreigners.

”Prostitution must be criminal-
ly punishable,” the newspaper
said. ”The moral degradation is
great. In our country this ugly
phenomenon must not stay be-
yond the law.”

Col. E. Chaikovsky of the
Moscow Bureau of Criminal In-
vestigation told the newspaper
that the law only allows adminis-
trative punishment of prostitutes
but that the -code requires the
prostitute to identify her client
and name her price. It also re-
quires a statement from the client.

The newspaper quoted Maj.
Sergei A. Adzhiev of the Minis-
try of Internal Affairs as saying of
the 3,500 women on his list:
”I’ve seen them all. The grown-
up contingent here is very wide
— from 14 to 70. The ideal ex-
ample is a ‘dynasty’ where the

grandmother, daughter and ‘

granddaughter ’work’ together.”
They appear at police precincts

' with ”vacant gazes, unwashed,

swollen faces and unkempt hair,”
he said.

Adzhiev divided the prostitutes
into three categories: those who
work the hotels and bars in
downtown Moscow and com-
mand the highest prices, those
who ‘know no life outside prosti-
tution and women who lack even
a permanent place to live.

The public square is the last
stop for a prostitute, Adzhiev
said, adding their minimum fee
’’is a glass of cheap wine.”

Is Davereally that funny?

By Bob Travers

Over last Christmas Late Night with David Letterman recorded
its highest ratings ever. 1 .

Usually the holidays‘ are a pretty bleak time for ratings, but Late
Night had an advantage that other shows lacked — a loyal au-
dience ot college students retu_rning home to their parents’ televi-
sion sets.

I think part of the reason for such ratings is that Letterman is ours.
He is a part of our generation's culture. The Letterman show will
be somethin that we will tell our children about whenlthey ask
what it was li e to grow up back in the '80s. Our parents can have
Jack Paar and Steve Allen. We'll take Dave and Stupid Pet Tricks.«

And the reason he is ours is, like so many of us, he refuses to take

J

anything seriously. Richard Pryor once said there is nothing that can—
not be made into a ioke — Letterman seems to live his life accord-
ing to such a credo.

~ In a Ro//ing Stone interview in l985 Letterman said that when he

was in high school he wasn't in with the iocks, he was too dumb .

—to be in with the intellectuals, nor was he in the band or a member
of the student council. He was, he said, in with the group who sat
around making fun of all the groups. _ .

l think perhaps, that for more than any other reason, this is why
Letterman relates so well to students. We are not in the generation
to fight a war, nor to protest one. We are not the Disco genera-
tion, the Woodstock generation or the Lost generation. We are

the generation who laughs at them~all. And right now, nobody is

laughing louder than David Letterman. . _ .

 Angeliccanh-aversy    

How can you mend a broken heart?

The sometimes sleazy Harry Angel (Mickey Rourkel be-

comes involved with Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet).

By Douglas Woodrow Payne

Alan Parker's Ange/ Heart,
much like last year's B/ue Ve/vet,
dissolves scenic confines and
stretches visual boundaries be-
yond the imagination. ,

The film is a psychological al-
legory of disproportionate real-
ity where the symbolism narrates
as the haunted soul journeys
forth to doom.

There is, however, a possibil-
ity, due to the notoriety of delet-
ed scenes and a possible X
rating, that you know more
about Ange/ Heart than you
should. it is a story, like an
onion, peeled layer by layer to
its eventual conclusion — it is that
conclusion which, naturally,
motivates the drama’s course
and suspends the mystery.

This synopsis, then, shall
respect your little knowledge of
this film. A viewer should be an
innocent bystander in a film of
this nature; thus his naivete is to
be, perhaps, pillaged if not en-
tirely assualted.

Mickey Rourke, stubble-faced
and scuzzy looking, plays Har-
ry Angel, a gumshoe knocking
about in Brooklyn ’round about
i955. He is haunted by dreams
and delusions in which he cons-
tantly attempts to approach a
mysterious woman veiled in

awards, customer satisfaction,
or word of mouth—two
loudspeakers have stood

head and shoulders above
the competition. ,

Year after year, the
Boston Acoustics A100 and
A70 loudspeakers have
offered wider, smoother
frequency response and
more natural sound than

black who often sits in vacuous

rooms.

A wash of blood or the force
of reality often impede upon his
recurring nightmare before he -
or the viewer — is able to dis-
cern who the woman is or why
she is there.

“A vie wer

should be an innocent
bystander in a film of
this nature ...”

Angel is hired by the mysteri-
ous and sinister Louis Cyphere
(wickedly performed by Robert
DeNiro) to find the whereabouts
of Johnny Favorite, a missing
crooner with a debt to pay.
An el’s investigation takes him
to t e Louisiana bayou where a
path of murders parallel his trek.

He meets a beautiful young
mother, Epiphany Proudfoot
(Lisa Bonnet in her notoriously
steamy, un-Cosbylike role), who
might know something very im-
portant about Favorite. She im-
mediately attracts the weary
Angel and leads him into temp-

_-a«

It is their ”steamy" love scene
that provoked the ratings board
so fervently. A

Although it must be noted that
what remains in this scene‘ is
visually stunning, it is never lurid
nor hardly graphic. An increas-
ingly steady downpour of rain
turns into blood as it washes
down the hotel walls, and the
violence, which is obviously
there, is merely implied. _ '

Harry Angel eventually meets
a trumpet player named Toots

Sweets and is hurdled into the ’

weird world of voodoo and
devil rituals. He is quite aware
that as he fits the pieces of the
puzzle together, he is also un—_
ravelling the demons in his soul.
He will solve his most
challenging case by confronting
his own being, which becomes
more apparent to him after his
odd meeetings with his employ-
er, lvlr. Cyphere. - «

enjoyment. Director Alan Parker

has constructed something as

with the same sense of desper-

If when listening to this three-

of the work of U2, Simple Minds‘
or The Waterboys, it's only be-
cause all three of those bands
(and numerous others) were in-

as ever, though, on this outing,
with the transporting title song,
the swaying, iazzy "Caveman-

. Writing for I.aIe-Night

Going from NationalLampoon to a national happening

By Bob Travers

Regular viewers of late Night
have probably wondered at
some point: "Just what kind of
weirdos come up with this
stuff?" .

One gets the impression from
watching the show that the writ-
ing staff is comprised of a bunch
of ex—class clowns who quit
school after ninth grade to go
live on a beach somewhere and
make fun of the_tourists.

I mean, would a normal adult
come up with ideas like sending
Larry "Bud" lvlelman to the
Soviet Union's U.N. mission with
a bullhorn and instuctions to try
to get diplomats to defect? Or
throw a carton of eggs into a
huge fanand show the results in
super slow motion? Or introduce
the world to the late Night
MonkeyCam?

No, these writers must be a
very disturbed group of in-
dividuals.

I talked to late Night writer
Kevin Curran to see just how far
gone they actually were.

Curran, 30, is one of lO full-
time writers on the show and has
been with the program since
l984. Before that, he was an
editor at National lampoon
magazine.

He claims responsibiltity for
the ”3<60-degree rotation
show,” the "morning show”
and Harmon Killebrew Night.

C

O The show is riding a
crest of popularity right now. Do
you think it can’ last?

A : I agree that the show is
riding a crest now, but I'm not
sure why. It has always been an
excellent show, but now it's just
been getting more media atten-
tion. I think that because the for-
mat of the show is a talk show
that it can last forever.

Whether it does or not de-
pends on what Dave wants to
do, how long he wants to stay
with it. He is always getting
movie deals and production
deals.

But l think Dave was born to
be on TV. It suits his style perfect-
ly because he is so quick,
whereas in a movie, everything

is scripted out, and you can't ad

lib as much.

‘‘I think

Dave was born to be on 2

perfectly because he is
so quick.”

everything is organized. We
have a meeting every day from
TO to ll a.m. where we go over
what we're doing for the next
two days. Then we have
another meeting at 6:30 p.m.,
after we tape the show. Those
can last as long as two hours.

We have also have a story-
board with ideas for up to two
weeks in advance.

. ’ .

0 Do writers have
specialty areas? Are there some
things, say Top l 0 lists, that one
person concentrates on?

: We all have certain
things we like to do. For exam-
ple, the Top l0 lists. I really like
writing them, but all the other
writers work on them as well.

C

0 What are some
favorite jokes you've written that
made it onto the show?

A : l liked the 3<SO—degree
show. Our switchboard got
about 90 calls from people com-
plaining about being dizzy or
nauseous from watching the
show. [On that program the pic-
ture was spun around 360
degrees, so that halfway
through the show the picture
was completely upside—down.]

C

0 How much of what you
write actually makes it on the
air?

A: About 50 percent. In

the end, it's Dave's~decision.
And if he decides it won't work,

we won’t'use it. An example of .

that is the "Re—Enactment
Show." We were going to take
an old show and recast Dave
and Paul with new actors. But
Dave decided the viewers
wouldn't stay with it for more
than a few minutes.

The D'V'"e H0’-Semen _ you can count on esoteric, but they dolexist.
CT'0Wded H0U5e _ , Recently the Pitt Program Council sponsored a highly successful
, And “OT mUCl'l ‘T1073! ‘ 9'79"’ Week '5 CM" 5 hardcore show in the William_ Pitt Union, featuring three local bands.
“ ,, Even if you're not a fan of hardcore, the reasonable admission fees
Scotland Yard (FREE!) would make it worthwhile — if nothing else but to see the

interesting haircuts. .
Also in the student union, Pitt radio station WPTS sponsored last
month's "Local Music Fest '87.” It featured three bands, each with

considering the event was a fundraiser for the non—profit station.
These kinds of events happen at both Pitt and CMU sporadically.

A place you can count on every week is ClvlU's ”Scotland Yard"
— a non-alcoholic student pub that's been around for about a year
and a half. It features live entertainment every weekend, with local
bands such as Hector in Paris, The Cynics, The Toll and The Af-
fordable Floors; Adding to the appeal is Scotland Yard’s non-
existent cover charge. ' ~
radio stations and through the bands’ releases.‘

Pitt's WPTS (98.5 FM) and Cl\/lU's WRCT (88.3 FM) both play
an abundance. of local music. Commericial station WXXP (T 00.7
FM) has been testing the waters with a few local bands. You can
support your favorite locals by requesting them at any of these
stations. ,

Many Pittsburgh bands have records and tapes for sale. The Lit-
tle Wretches and The Spuds have both made tapes. Half Life, Hec-
tor in Paris, Doomwatch, The Pep Boys and various others have
produced singles. The Cynics have several singles with an album
coming in a few weeks. Special Ed and The Affordable Floors have
both put out albums. This stuff is available at Jim's Records in Bloom-
field, and some can even be found at Oasis on Forbes Avenue!

To claim that Ange/ Heart is
Parker's best film, however, is
certainly overstatingthe matter.
His symbolic uses of window
fans, ascending staircases,
opening gates, vacated rooms
and especially chickens are not
only riveting and exquisite, but
also repetitive. He doesn't trust
his audience enough to grasp
the messages, but perhaps
there's a reason for that.

The moral of the story comes
at the very end, as it should, but
so does the motivation for why

OT-O O

I —

want to see the film a second
time to appreciate the abundant
artistry, if not merely to grasp on
understanding of it all. Under-
standably, most don't have that
kind of patience. Ange/ Heart is
a good time at the movies with
violence to spare, but it is not for
the impetuous or the faint of
head.

Rourke, in yet another low—life
role, plays his part with a great
determination and convincing
psychosis (something he has
done well in Body /-/eat and
Rumb/efish, but still not as patho-
logically graphic as Dennis
Hopper).

Suffice it to say, DeNiro is ut-

terly intense and quite creepy as
Cyphere.

Together, Rourke and DeNiro
have a dynamic chemistry sub-
terfuging each other's unique
and brittle extremities. lt is ‘a
wonderful combination.

Ange/ Heart brings back the
excitement and joy of going to
the cinema, but it won't appeal
to everyone.

It's relentlessly provocative,
disturbingly powerful and in the
end, somehow awesome — yet
it still pulls its punches on some
slick gore, kinky obsessions and
violent drama. Angel Hean‘ may
sound overwhelming, and _it is,

but it should be.

He's not as overtly sarcastic to
the guests now. He was per-
ceived by some people as be-
ing too sarcastic, and he has
conciously tried to tone that
down.

 John Hughes’ adoration of adolescence getting tiresome

“Hugh es

 views. This is under-

standable when you

’ Eiueems_%_

By lke Shibley

Some kind of wonderful is how
I usually feel when exiting a John
Hughes film. ‘

His ability to tap the positive V

feelings in everyone is a won-
derful gift that he uses quite ef-
fectively. .

The newest film written and
produced by Hughes is not
directed by him. Howard
Deutsch has taken over this time,
giving Hughes the opportunity to
direct his forthcoming effort
about young adults — yes,
adults — starring Kevin Bacon
and Elizabeth McGovern.

The storyline in Some Kind of
Wonderful is definitive Hughes.

  

Anyone who has ever seen Pret-
ty in Pink will notice a multitude
of striking similarities.

The story revolves around
three high school students and
their dealings with love and
friendship. Unlike Pretty in Pink,
there are two females in the tale,
with only one male counterpart.

One girl runs with the."in"«

crowd while the other is some-
what of an outcast. The outcast
comes from a broken home; the
”hip" girl has a happy family.
The male likes the ”hipper” girl
butthe outcast likes him. Sound
familiar? 0

Hughes draws his characters
rather sharply. Every one of the
participants in his stories has
vividly defined attitudes and
views. This is understandable

 

, THE Pl'lTvNEV\_/S, Friday, March‘ 13, 1987

It makes the story extremely
easy to understand.

Although this may seem sim-
plistic, it elicits the desired
response with no ambiguity.

As in The Breakfast C/ub, Six-
teen Cand/es and Pretty in Pink,
there is at least one character in
Some Kind of Wondertu/ that is
easy to relate to.

Each person will relate in a
different way, but there is al-
ways a special compassion with
one character in particular.
Again Hughes ‘designs his scripts
so that everyone can extract
something from it, depending on
his or her personality.

Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart
ivlasterson and Lea Thompson
play the three leads. None are
given a chance to show much

Masterson. This is probably be-
cause she plays the character
with emotional depth. She is a
pleasure to watch, as she was
in At C/ose Range. She plays the
girl who just doesn't quite fit in.

The conviction that she lends
to the part makes the movie
more believable.‘

Some Kind of Wonden‘u/ is not
a great film. But it is a fine piece
of craftmanship designed with
teen—agers in mind. it extends
beyond recognition by teens,
but not much. The movie makes
one feel good about life, and it
causes one to wish life were as
simple as in the movies. 0

Even though the story is shal-
low the characters are stereo-
typed, there is something here
for almost everyone. it recalled

THE PITT NEWS

By Lee Linder

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ Vil-
lanova basketball coach" Rollie
Massimino expressed disappoint-
ment and sorrow over his former
star player's ”personal tragedy

and said he did not know Gary‘

McLain was hooked on drugs.
”I never knew about Gary
McLain’s drug problem and if I
had known there was no way he
would have kept playing for me,”
said Massimino during a press
conference, his first since
McLain’s first-person expose in
Sports. Illustrated was published.
McLain, in a sensational con-
fession for which he received a
reported $40,000, told how he
used and sold cocaine while he
was a member of a Villanova

team that two years ago won the
national NCAA championship.

McLain, in his description of an
addiction he now claims to have
licked, said he was on drugs
when the team went to the White
House to be congratulated by
President Reagan.

A nervousand perspiring Mas-
simino, flanked at the press.con-
ference by university officials,
told reporters ’’I never knew,
never knew.”

He added, with a shrug of his

' head, ”I still can't conceive that

everything in his article is true.
The whole thingjis composed of
perceptions. What's perception
and what's reality?” ‘

Joining Massimino at the press
conference were Villanova presi-
dent John Driscoll, the school's
dean of students, Father John

  

Stark, and athletic director Ted
Aseto.

At one point, Massimino said
he had heard rumors about
McLain using drugs.

”I called him and talked to him
about it when I heard rumors,”
the coach said. He said Stark also
investigated the reports.

”He vehemently denied it. He
said, ‘no way, coach.’ And I real-
ly believed him. I had told him
that if he didn't believe in what
we were doing at Villanova he
should leave the team.

”There were never..any visible
symptoms. He wasn't late (for
practice) He was always bubbly,
filled with vim and vigor. He was

' our court jester, the spokesman of

our basketball team. He entirely
fooled me, as he fooled millions
of others.”

Asked why he didn't ask
McLain to submit to a drug test
when the drug rumors surfaced
back in .1984, Massimino said
drug tests weren't done back
then. Now, though, he said, ”Per—
sonally I believe in drug testing.”

”Nothing was done,” said.

Stark, ”because we had no
evidence.” -

The dean of students said Vil-
lanova for the past year, long be-
fore the McI;ain bombshell, has
been discussing the idea of test-
ing all athletes, ”but we haven't
decided on a policy yet.” Also,
Stark said, ”We’re not sure that
the NCAA random testing policy,
now in effect in the champion-
ship rounds, is the right thing. It
seems like an easy fix.”

The dean said Vil|anova’s only
procedure now is to advise all

 

Massiminoshockedby McLain’s drug use

students, athletes or not, that ”if
you are caught with cocaine or
heroin you are out.”

McLain’s former teammates
were dismayed by the sordid tale.

’’I’m in shock,” said Ed (Pin-
ckney, now playing for the Phoe-
nix Suns of the NBA‘. He was
McLain"s roomate for two years

at Villanova. ”It’s like reading’

about a stranger, aguy I never
knew.

”We practiced together, were
in school together, played
together, I consider us pretty
close buddies. We're" like

brothers. You would think I..

would've suspected something.
But I never did.” A

Mark Plansky, a junior forward I
who played on the championship A
team, said others may’ have _.

‘foot players that Pitt will have to .contend_ withsvltonight. 

Panterave big task

By John Enright
Sports Editor

Smits, Pecarski, Krasovec
and Bourgarel. These guys
definitely aren't household
names on the college basket-
ball circuit. .

But, they are four of the
players foremost on Pitt Pan-
ther head coach Paul Evans’
mind.

Rik Smits 7-3 ‘(a' native of
Holland), 6-1 1 Miroslav Pecar-
ski (Yugoslavia), 6-8 Peter
Krasovec (Hungary) and 7-0
Rudy Bourgarel (Guadeloupe)
comprisethe ”European Con-
nection” on the Marist Red
Foxes — Pitt's opponent
tonight in the first round of the
Western‘ Regional of the

” NCAA tournament in Tucson,
Ariz., at 9:07 EST. The game
can be seen locally on KDKA,
Channel 2. ' .

Marist (20-9) was the cham-
pion of the ECAC Metro Con-
ference this year and will be
making its second straight
NCAA _tournament appear-
ance. Last season the Red Fox-
es lost to _Georgia Tech‘ 68-53

g in the first round of the tour-
nament. ‘

”These kids are excited
about this,” said Marist first-
year head coach Dave Magar-
ity. ”They’re not just happy to
be here  having been there
before means an awful lot.”

Meanwhile, Pitt (24-7) is
making its first tournament ap-
pearance since 1985. Last year
the Panthers played in the NIT
and humiliated themselves by
losing to Southwest Missouri
State 59-52. J

Pitt, seeded third in the
West, is a , heavy favorite
against 14th-seeded Marist,
but the Panthers aren't about
to take matters lightly. ”This is
only my second trip to the
NCAAs,” said Pitt center
Charles Smith. ”My first trip
was a disaster [a 78-54 loss to
Louisiana Tech two years ago],
so there's no way I'm going to

_ go in‘ there o.\'_/er__c‘on_’r'_ident.”-1.; ‘ 

a ainst
«g I  

We're going to
have to keep Pitt off
the boards...l don't
know if our kids will
be looking at lerome  
l.ane’s "shorts all
night.

— Dave Magarity

The Panthers do have an ad-
vantage because of their su-
perior talent, but Marist’s
height could pose a problem.
The Red Foxes start a 6-8‘, 6-11
and 7-3 frontline, and they
bring 7-foot Bourgarel off the
bench.

Meanwhile, the Panthers
will start 6-5 Demetreus Gore,
6-6 Jerome Lane and 6-10
Smith in the front court.

Obviously Marist has a size
advantage, although Pitt is the
second leading rebounding
team inthe country, and Lane
is the nation's leading re-
bounder with 13.7 boards per
game. ’

Maybe. Marist has the
problem after all. ”We’re go-
ing to have to keep Pitt off the
boards,” said Magarity. ”I
don't know if it's, going to be ‘
possible. I don't know if our
kids are going to be looking at
Jerome (Lane's shorts all
night.” _ - -

To compound that problem
Magarity —. the head coach at
St. Francis (Pa.) from
1978-1983 — said that Euro-
pean players usually have
difficu|ties_rebounding. ”With
European kids, the one thing
they don't do real well is box
out,” said Magarity. ”It’s a
force of habit and something
we've worked hard on.”

The most pivotal match-up
of the game should be the
Smits-Smith confrontation.
' Smits, a junior, is averaging

20-4 Poimaﬁ-5rebeuhdﬁand 

Marist

4.1 blocks per game. He
played on the Holland nation-
al team at the World Univer-
sity Games in Spain last
summer. ' ‘
Smith, who is averaging

' 16.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and

3.2 blocks this season, was the
leading scorer for the Gold-
medal winning U.S. squadat
those same World University
Games. ’ .
”It’s going to be interesting
to see those two on the same
floor,” said Magarity. “They're,
two different type players.
Smith is an NBA power for-
ward, while Rik is a center.”
Even if Smits has a great
game, Marist still may have its \
troubles. Said Magarity,
”We’re going to have to‘ do a
lot of little things well." A
Evans feels the key for Pitt '
will be getting into a fast-
paced game, an area_where
the Panthers have excelled this

‘ season. ”We have to press and

force the issue on the break

even after a made basket,” 

said Evans. - .

Tales of athletes and

Some points I'd like to make in
the wake of what I read in yester-
day's Sports Illustrated:

°Gary McLain’s first-person

I story was labeled as ”shocking”

by many.

Regardless, anyone who thinks
McLain’s saga is an isolated case
— as far as college students are
concerned — is out of his mind.
This is the '80s.

Remember Len Bias, Don
Rogers and the major league
baseball players who admitted to
cocaine use? I

This type of thing is not ”shock-
ing” — it's expected.

0 A prediction: After the con-
troversy caused by the SMU
death penalty and the documen-
tation of McLain’s drug problems
have settled, the next major issue
involving athletes will deal with
AIDS.

°The rumors are flying al-

ready, and I'd like to clear some
of those up right now.

There is no truth to the rumor
that the Pirates are going to hire
Gary McLain as the next Pirate
Parrot or as their next clubhouse
boy.

Also, there is no truth to the
rumor that Curtis Strong prepares

tion here, also.

Staff W,,-,9, this year will be our defense,” Shortstop: The only definite on
their typically strong defense to Lewis predicted. Asked about the left side of the infield will be
Like 200,000 other college stu- contend against perrenial power weaknesses, Lewis pointed to Mike Claus, a freshman from

dents this March, Pitt's varsity
baseball players are heading to

Florida. And like nearly a quart- _

er of a million classmates, they
are there to play games.

The Panthers will open their
1987 baseball season this Sunday
against Central Florida Universi-
ty in a tournament in Orlando.

Bobby Lewis, beginning his.

33rd year as Pitt's manager, is
looking to build on last year's
strong finish. The 1-986 Panthers
were 10-22 at the end of the sea-
son, after a disastrous midseason
stretch when they went 1-18.
”At the end of last year, we
learned how to win,” said Lewis.
”And I hope that carries over to

_ _this season.”

Lewis will be relying on proven
players like last season's team
MVP Brian Lohman, Gregg
Lamanti and Dave Westwood. At
the same time, he is hopingto de-
velop a strong, young pitching

Seton Hall in the Big East Con-
ference.

”Defensively, we can play with
anybody,” Lewis said. ”We’ve
been practicing in Fitzgerald
Field House sincejanuary, and if
we ever played anybody on a
basketball floor, we'd crush
them.”

Unfortunately for Lewis, the
Panthers play at Trees Field — a
far cry from Florida or Fitzgerald
Field House.

Battling the elements of early
spring is the major factor prevent-
ing Northern colleges from com-
peting on a national level with
Southern schools. In a typical sea-
son, Pitt can expect to lose 8-10
games because of the elements.

That may have been an ade-
quate excuse last year for a team
thathad as much trouble winning
as Pitt, but Lewis believes the
1987 season to be more
promising. ‘

overall team speed, which he
calls only ”adequate,” and to the
Panthers’ lack of depth on the
mound.

Around the diamond in 1987,
the Panthers will look like this:

Catcher: Junior John Brush and
sophomorejeff Hackett will split
duties behind the plate. Lewis
said he is equally comfortable
with either.

First Base: Westwood, one of
Pitt's heaviest hitters,» is the first
baseman. Westwood, a 5-11 left-
hander from Pittsburgh, played
here last season as well.

Second Base: A battle is brew-V

ing at second base, Lewis said.
Either TJ. O’Leary, Alan Popa or
Rich Schaich will be the starter.
This position may be determined
in Florida.

Third Base: Lamanti and Rich
Deiley are fighting for the hot
corner starting spot. Lewis said
either player could win the posi-

Shaler High School, who will
start at shortstop. Claus may well
be the only freshman tostart for
Pitt.

Left Field: Pitt's best hitter, Bri-
an Lohman, will start here as he
did last season. The 6-0 junior
was one of the top sophomores
in the Big East last year.

Centerfield and Right Field:
Both ofthese outfield positions
are up for grabs. No fewer than
five players will compete for
these two remaining positions.
Freshmen Matt Bianco and Bob
Nerone, sophomore Jay Duder-
stadt and'Bill Osborn and Chuck
Scales — two players better
known as Pitt football wide
receivers — will compete for the
open spots.

’’All of them are good defen-
sively,” Lewis said. ”It will be a
matter of who is hitting well, who

is hot. The season is so short in,

cpllege baseball that you can't af-

0 ei.'
ford to have a slump.”

Pitcher: Lewis plans on ‘using’

right-handers Keith Shuster and
Frank Merigliano and left-hander

Rich Garvan to do the bulk of the E
pitching this year, both starting ,

and relieving. Sophomores John
Carroll and Steve Hoffman, both

right-handers, should also see.
some action. Dave Kleindl, a"

junior right-hander, is recovering
from a back injury.

Pitt's first home‘ game is. a ,-
double-header on April 4 against ‘
Georgetown. All home games are .

played at Trees Field, and admis-
sion is free. ’
