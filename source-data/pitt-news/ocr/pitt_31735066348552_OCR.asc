Four MCNR - Tower B

  Co-ed Floors

‘-“<'."*\

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The 10th ﬂoor of MCNR and the
17, 18, and 19th ﬂoors of Tower B
are slated to ‘become co-ed
Community ‘Development ﬂoors for
the 1975-76 year. .

Assistant to the Director, Office of
Residence Life, Tim Snyder ex-
plained the ‘move as another
alternative lifestyle option, like the
Health Profession Unit, the Inter-
national’ Unit or the Intensive Study
Areas,.for students living in the
residence halls.

“We are seeking to .make the
dorms, particularly Tower B, a
better place to live. We hope to
 make the Towers a place where
~..-3-rm students will want to live,” Snyder

said. - _ "
The Community "Development
aspect of the co-ed ﬂoors is being
stressed to help people living in the
dorm environment to develop a
basic sense‘ of community within
their floors. -
“Most of the data from other
-.2, universities and colleges having
'5’ 50-ed residence areas‘ shows that,
in effect, people on co-ed ﬂoors
develop person-to-person relation-
ships rather than 'male-female
relationships, and a greater sense
of community,” explained Snyder.

RSA Chairman Jim, Datovech
agreed saying, “They’ll develop
more of a sense of community,
there will be more incentive to do
things with people on the floor
laecause of the co-ed atmosphere.”

Snyder explained co-ed ﬂoors
would encourage a sense of identity

Combats Hunger

With 36-hr. Fast

BY KEN GORMLEY

A 36 hour fast, to raise money for

poor and starving people, will be

jet sponsored by the Belleﬁeld Pres-
‘ byterian Church in Oakland, from 8

am March 11 to 8 pm March 12.

Participants will refrain from
eating for one and a half days, and
will ask sponsors to pledge a
certain amount of money for each
hour they fast.‘

All proceeds wilt be turned over to
the Christian Rural Overseas
Program (CROP), which will
distribute the funds to needy areas
abroad, particularly -the Sahara
region of Africa.

Reverend Greg Ogden, assistant
Minister at the Belleﬁeld Presby-
terian Church, hopes to get over

‘o*~‘\1,000 students involved in the fast.
And most of them, he expects, will
come from Pitt.

“Our main focus is on" the

University Campus. We are con-
tacting students from Carlow and

among -ﬂoor members and would
aid students in getting to know
more people on their ﬂoors. “Co-ed
floors in Tower B will also improve
security,” said Snyder, “because
people will be less likely to bang on
the security doors ‘if they know a
guy will answer the door.”

The sense of community among
the floor members. would create a
different attitude on the ﬂoor, and
would contribute to a better living
atmosphere, added Datovech.

Development of the sense of
community will be dependent on
the actions of the floor members,
explained Snyder. “We will set up
the basic organizational frame-
work, but the people living on the
floors will make the decisions on
the rules to abide by,” he added.‘

Resident Assistants for the co-ed
units will be specially chosen and
will be oriented toward facilitating
the interaction of ﬂoor members
within the organizational structure.

For late March

Tenant-Landlord Day Planned  

CRAIG BLUESTEIN

BY MARIBETH DORAN

Students" renting apartments in
the Oakland-Shadyside-Squirrel
Hill area will have an opp_ortunity
to meet their landlords one
afternoon in late March, according
to Student Government Board
member Craig Bluestein.

Bluestein stated the major pur-
pose of “Meet the Landlords Day”
will be to “open channels__ of
communication between landlords‘
and tenants.”

Approximately 2500 students‘ cur-
rently reside in off-campus housing

Bluestein said, and most have little 1

contact with their landlords. By

 
 
   

 

isms of; the-.L existing

bringing landlords and tenants"

. The vanguard in security for Pitt dorms are the desk attendants, who

.   NewiDorm Security Proposed

 

keep a sharp eye for weirdos and strange customers. Even. stricter
security measures may be in the offing. T '

problems can be removed, he said.

In addition to meeting and talking
to landlords, renters and prospec-
tive tenants can learn about legal
rights and liabilities, and responsi-
bilites of different parties toward
dwelling upkeep, health and
security.

The damage obligations of land-
lords and tenants‘can be discussed
with representatives of the County
Health /Department, the Building

‘Inspectors Union and the Pitt Legal

Awareness Committee, all of whom
will be in attendance, according to
Bluestein. ’

Also attending will be representa-
tives from Student Government,
the Ofﬁce of the Chancellor,
Oakland Development Incorporat-
ed, the Pitt Tenant Union and
Off-Campus Housing.

Bluestein stressed the need for
large student attendance’ because
“the more students that attend, the
more effective the program will
be.” He also commented if a large
amount of students show up at the
meeting, “it will prove to the area
landlords that ~Pitt renters have a
large amount
power.”

Bluestein’s idea for the program
was partially due to a two year
involvement with the Pitt Tenant
Union, and over a year’s exerience
in working with the Legal Aware-
ness Committee. He stated most
of the problems students encounter
are a result of their lack of
knowledge concerning renting pro-
cedures.

Currently, Bluestein and three

.-other "Legal Awareness Committee -

of bargaining _

  

members are compiling a, booklet,
“A Guide to Apartment Living” to
aid student renters. The booklet
will include all the information

necessary to select a good’

apartment.

Bluesteincommented one of his
hopes for the Meet the Landlords
program will be to “_improve the
atmosphere of renting in the
community because presently it
seems to. be landlord against
tenant.”

Pitt Professor Chairs

|nt’| Studies Conference  

BY REBECCA SCHORIN

A Pitt professor of education and
international affairs specialist, Seth
Spaulding, chaired _ a panel last
week in Washington at the 16th
annual convention of the Internat-
ional Studies Association on the
topic “Should the United States
Withdraw from UNESCO?”

UNESCO [United Nations Educa-
tional, Scientific and Cultural
Organization] has been the object
of a great deal of controversy since
November, when, at its Biennial
General Conference, it called on
Israel to stop archaeological explor-
ation in occupied areas and
imposed sanctions in the form of

Nations has changed. With 135
members the United States can’t
expect to have everything go the
way it wants. The sanctions against
Israel reflect current political
groupings in the UN system.”

Spaulding pointed out the exclus-
ion of Israel from the European
regional group is nominal only,
because it will not meet before the
next. General Conference, two
years from now. He added both this
and the excavation sanction are
heightened by extreme emotional
involvement.

“However it is unfortunate that
an issue with such clear political
overtones . did come up in
UNESCO.” Spaulding suggested

pf



'5

that the leadership should not have -

allowed the discussion to reach a
formal vote. ‘ ‘Let the political votes
happen in the General Assembly,‘

UNESCO should remain a channel

for discussion.”

‘The Congressional ac-tion to
withhold the $9 million due to
UNESCO could, according to
Spaulding, be unconstitutional.
“The United States has a treaty
obligation to contribute 25% of
UNESCO’s budget.” He also
suggested that the backlash a-
gainst UNESCO is,‘ in part,
undeserved. “These are just two
resolutions passed out of 400, many
of which promote educational and
cultural programs in poor coun-
tries.”

since 1963 is currently professor of
education and social and economic

  NewDorm Security Plan

Proposed for Next Year

‘ (Continued from Page 1)
(RSA) chairman Jim Datovech said

he needs some deﬁnitive answers-

about the plan. “Residents not
being able to have visitors at night
/\Ws a real drawback,” he said, “and
Ithink there should be no charge to
have a guest over the weekend.

“A student’s room is his home
and he should be able to have
someone stay over whenever he
wants.’’ ’

Datovech said he thinks the
‘current system doesn’t work well,
but that he wouldn’t want “one set
of headaches in exchange for
another. _

“Until a lot of questions are
worked out and" a. lot of bugs
removed in this plan, there can’t be
a substitute made.”

Datovech also said he can’t be‘

f"‘Y’,.\_sure if damage in the Towers is
done by outsiders or “rowdy

residents having parties.

‘ ‘Unless you catch them, you can’t.

tell who’s causing the trouble,” he

said. “But it would be better to
limit the Towers "to residents. ’ ’

Albert agreed no one could be

_ sure who is causing the problem,

but said he‘ caught an outsider

vandalizing a_ coin machine in the

Towers Saturday. ' p

“The question ‘of security has to
be settled soon,” Albert said,
“before the end of the school year.

“We might take a poll or census"

of the residents. I think most of

them would go for the plan, even

though it might be more of a
hassle.

“But it would pay off,” he added.
Students might not have to lock
their doors when they go out, and
we could have better recreation
facilities without worrying about
them getting ripped off.”

CMU, but by and large those
fasting and making pledges will be
from Pitt,” he said.

Ogden explained about 80% of
the student congregation at the
church comes from the Pitt
campus, and many of'these
students have begun forming
“action groups” in the dorms. The
purpose of these groups is to
convince other students of the
worthiness of the cause, so they
will either pledge a contribution or
fast themselves. - .

qBy depriving themselves of either

food or money in the form of a ’

pledge, Ogden is convinced stu-
dents will become more aware of
the suffering millions throughout
the world are experiencing, while
simultaneously helping to care that
suffering.

“Sure, we want people to
sacriﬁce. They have to feel the
deprivation if they are to identify
with those who are without food,”-
he insisted. .

“Students see the problems, and
they want to do something. This is
a tangible ' way for people to
distribute the wealth to help those
on the verge of starvation.”

During the fast, Ogden said his
church hopes to set up an orange
juice stand in front of the
Cathedral, which will serve as ‘a
congregation point for the partici-
pants. Each person doing without

“"' ‘The method for achieving this isolation, according to Albert’s plan is a
 series of barricades in the Towers Lobbies, through which only those

visitors. “They may have to go somewhere elso to meet,” says Albert.

Editor’s note: The following is the
first installment of a three-part
series that proposes to examine the
present state of U.S. leadership,
both foreign and domestic, and to
project the new status of American
commitments around the world as
we enter the closing quarter of the

century. -

BY TOM WASELESKI

The real tragedy of the Watergate
scandal is not that - it was a
desperate grab for power, but that
it is regarded as such and nothing
more. In the long run, the affair is
perhaps the

that the ofﬁcial leadership in the
United States has gone severely
ask_ew without the people’s realiza-
tion. '

We find ourselves having to
accept ' the notion of a power
vacuum in a state that wields an
enviable amount of power on the
international scene. ' ‘

Lack of decisiveness has mani-
fested itself in every corner of
American government, in- every
contemporary issue.

' The economy, for one; has been

an unpredictable‘ gargantua since
the days of Lyndon Johnson. Three
presidents have vowed to produce
the weapon that would once and for
all put an end to spiraling inﬂation.
But such promises have’ been as
fruitful as the search for the Holy
Grail.

President Ford’s policy, indeed a‘

non-policy, for inflation-recession
is one of tolerance until the solution
arrives on its own. Americans
must suffer an average unemploy-

ment rate of almost 8% for the next '

three years---this is no prediction,
this‘ is Mr. Ford’s policy. (

- He legislates tariffs for the oil
corporations, but refuses to press
for signiﬁcant relief for working
individuals. His claim is to prevent

-the Arabs from accumulating

enough American wealth to in-
ﬂuence national ' security. Some
members of Congress feel such
cause foralarm is premature.
Whether it is or not, the’ fact

' remains that President Ford would

PiltNews Runs

Pleasant Reading

Editor: I

The Pitt News issue of Wednesw

day, February 12, contained two" of
the best articles the Pitt News has
ever ‘(since l’ve watched it) had the
privilege to run. Those articles
were Matt Kennedy’s “Symptoms
_ of Big Crack-Up,” and Ken Gorm-
ley’s “The Gingko Grows.” -In a
year when I am .sick to death of
reading about the protracted fight

spread the cost of containing Arab
buying power over the entire
populace, -rathe'r than forbidding
corporate holders to sell American
shares to foreigners in the first
place. - _

The President continues to press

his luck by ignoring heavy opposi-
tion in the Congress and governor’s
conference. His policies are even
unpopular with his own party, who,
for all intents and purposes, have
dropped him from their.l976 ticket.
It’s hard to believe his controver-
sial methods’are the result of some
well-thought out act of conscience.
His initial proposal of consumer
voluntarism did not appear to stem
from ‘a great deal of thought, and
his indecision over which to fight
first, inﬂation or recession, did not
seem to reflect a very clear
conscience. , _ ‘

Not that Mr. Ford’s non-election
to the presidency should restrict his
ability to make governing deci-
sions, but one would naturally
assume that because of his unusual
accession, he would beespecially
genial to the legislative branch and
seek to maintain a caretaker gov-
ernment. » " ' .

Nevertheless the present Con-

' gress is also less than inspiring,

despite the necessity for quick,
sharp decision-making. If . young
pages are not ‘awe-struck by the
decisiveness of their bosses, then
how is a president to’ be? Both
legislative bodies are seeking a
90-day stall on the President’s $3
per barrel oil levy, and it’s difﬁcult
to believe they will formulate an
effective piece of legislation in that
amount of time. , .
In recent’ years Congress has
degenerated into an anonymous

‘ voting body whose shifting majori-

ties and minorities too often stack
up along party lines. Without the
dynamic leaders that can muster
votes even against the grain’ of

party . dogma, the working Con- ——

gress is dead. Debate must be

provoked and spineless presidents ’

must be spurred on.

A great factor in Congress’ pres-
ent failure to mobilize‘ is the arrival
on the American scene of a new

political phenomenon: the perpet-
ual presidential campaign.

Ever since George McGovern’s
two-year run for glory, contenders
have been announcing their candi-
dacies at increasingly earlier dates,
much to the detriment of their own
effectiveness as motivators in the
House and "Senate.

The disclosure of one’s intention
to run is a courting of the most
inﬂuential sectors of the nation.
And since time immemorial the
person in a campaign who can be
least held to his/ her word is the

‘ one running.
Thus, the would-be leaders of‘

Congress are dismissed by one of

three stigmas: they are too old and -

out of date, they are too young and
out of line, or they are running for
president. -

And the reason who so many run

so early, referring to the Demo-—
‘ impotence _
brought on by Edward Kennedy’s

crats, is the party

calculated ‘period of presidential
self-denial. Everyone knows he

' will eventually accept the presi- -

dency--the question that is killing
the Democratic leadership is when.
Until that day ﬁnally_comes, the
Jacksons and Wallaces and the
scores of ‘dark horses who see
themselves as compromise candi-
dates will run every four years as
long as they are not Humphried
ahd Muskied into political obsol-
escence.

In recent elections the Republican ‘

Party has been the one famous for

But lately the_

Democrats have been coming off "

' like hawkers‘ at the market place.

And with the stiff Democratic
majority, much of Congress is 
overcome by the carnival atmos-

phere to provide the conscientious,

loyal opposition that every presi-
dent expects and deserves.

What ultimately results from a , T

know-nothing president and a do-
nothing Congress are shabby
pieces of legislative band-aid
whose adhesives don’t hold up and

~ whose size is much too small for

current afﬂictions. .

. It seems the only problems in the
United States involveenergy and
the economy. But in reality there
are plenty of areas in which our
policies have been ignorantly mis-
guided. -

There is the recent difﬁculty
restricting (restricting, mind you--
not outlawing) the filibuster. There
is the question of government
subsidy to large /corporations such
as the Penn-Central Railroad and
Pan-American Airlines. Is it free
market enterprise when a company

is so huge that the government,

cannot permit it to. go broke and
disband? ,

Another issue is the nonchalance
with which persons like CIA direc-
tor William Colby claim allegations
against his agency will imperil its
work. It would be an action in
sharp denial of the distance we’ve
come in 200 years to allow an

organization with the power of the ‘

CIA go unchecked without the
slightest call to -answer for its
doings. ‘ . . _.

The lack of public outcry for these
issues is identical to the silence
that meets the various releases
emanating from San Clemente

concerning‘ Richard Nixon’s return

to statesmanship. Some eagerly
await his resurrection, and if it
does occur it will be because of

' some _masochistic strain that we
‘Americans have ‘developed during

these maddened times;
The leadership at homefails short’

(of being dynamic. But it is a fact of ‘

life that one is always the last to
know the truth about oneself. The
way we approach othercountries is
a fairly good indicator of where our
true. values lie.‘ v ' »

by my own main shop co-workers.
They may have been a whole carton
of glitches (foul-ups). but they had
the answers so I just called back.
Not only did they give me courtesy,
but sometimes they gave me the
strength to contend with what
became the lovable concern of
doing the best I could with what I
didn't know.

Every month my “carton of
glitches” processed my billing and
inventory without complaint. They
saw to it I got the supplies I ordered
even when it meant tracking down
undelivered goods quickly or dis-
patching a duplicate order. They
handled a lot of my mistakes in the
least embarrassing manner to me

they could. lfl did a lousyjob. they
covered for me. The shop or
another sub-station crowded in a
re-run of mine to get it out in time.

With that kind of back-up. I learned
to do a better job.

After seeing what my own office
did for me, my awareness extended
to the departments represneted by
my customers. “He always gets
his on 8‘/2 x 14” became a friend
with a name from a respectable
department which certainly works
as hard as mine. I have more
friends than enemies on campus
today and claim 50% responsibility
for the creation of both categories.

My foreman has guided me from
the days of giving up on a difficult

job and going home to the high
point of taking on the hard ones
first on good days or doing them in
order on the bad days and unfor-
turately for him. I still make more
noise than the machine. but at least
I'll get the bleedin' thing done.

That. my CE friend, is what your
supervisor or your co-workers
might be trying to do for you when
you stop knocking them. If they
aren't and you think because of this
your department isn't as nice as
mine, maybe you could ship out
some of your destructive ideas and
shape up your own good points.

It isn't easy if you're a you-know-
what on wheels. I'm one. but once

BY KEN GORMLEY
Thousands of years ago, as they
orged themselves on succulent
orkers roasted to a ‘crisp, the
, omans developed some of the
greatest past-times ever contrived
_y man.

One of the most unique, and the
avorite of many a centurian, was
‘bear-baiting.

' ‘In this gala event, a ferocious bear
as tied to a post in an arena full of
ine-raving Roman maniacs. A
ack.of toothy hounds was then
I icked on the massive beast, and a
‘bloody battle ensued until either
{the bear or the canine underdogs
emerged as victors.

, Occasionally, if the bear won, a
' few Christians were tossed into the
 arena to provide some comedy for
 the afternoons. All this was
« enjoyed immeasurably as the lazy,
;. smooth-hand Roman men in soft
ﬂowing tunics continued to gor-
Fjmandize and were fanned by pretty
-“young, maidens. ..

Today, in an age of the Marlboro
 Man and light bulb-eating football
‘V players, things have‘ changed. Try
; to throw a dog and a bear together
‘fin a ring to fight, and the NSPCA
j-will have you behind bars quicker
_ '_ than the bear. But let the bear
” ' fight a few dirt-eating human
‘beings, and‘ everything is fine.
_But one thing hasn't changed.
 There are still sadistic crowds who
love, who thrive on, seeing bones

A grizzly tale

wrestling bear. That’s right, he
wrestles people. And surrounding
the stage, with gleams in their
eyes, the descendents of the an-
cient Romans watched and wat-
ched.

Before I left to fight Victor, I did
30 quick push-ups. Why did I
decide to wrestle him? I guess
mainly for fear my manhood would
be revoked soon, since I have no

appetite for glass, and no desire to A

ride a horse into a 10,000 watt
Hollywood sunset smoking cigar-'
ettes. I figures wrestling a bear
would have to rate a close third.

Besides, things really get boring
around mid-terms.

Standing in front of the ring a few
minutes before Victor was sup-
posed to appear, my nose twitched
a little nervously as the smell of live
bear permeated my nostrils. My
only experience in wrestling was
that I’d grappled with my brother a
few times when he tried to make off
with a portion of my dessert. But

that was a while ago, rand, the

memory of those defeats wasn’t
very fresh in my mind.

A hulky little guy wearing a
spangled cape appeared on stage.
He was Victor’s trainer, and former
alligator wrestler, Tuffy Truesdell.
Tuffy explained that Victor was a
Canadian black bear, weighing
approximately 400 pounds. My
Adam’s apple sunk deep into my
throat.

Truesdell had walked seven miles
over a barren Canadian tundra to
get the little bear cub from his

temporary home at a log mill. At g

the time, Victor only weighed
several pounds. Now, standing six

foot four, the 17-year-old bear (the
equivalent of 68 human years)
weighed about a hundred times as
much. I was 16 years too late.

Tuffy asked the spectators to
move back so they didn’t get kicked
in the face (wait a minute--what
about me?), and the star of the
show made his appearance. A
huge black bear, with a smile
across his face, lumbered up onto
the stage. " '

A female trainer brought up a
glass bottle and held it out to her
“baby.” Victor took it inhis paws,
sat back on his tree-stump
haunches, and guzzled it. Oh
no--they were trying to get the
beast drunk so he would go beserk
and tear me to pieces. I’d
better...There was nothing to
worry about. It was just Kool-aid.

Victor really likes-soft drinks, and
his trainer explained that he gets a
bottle before and after the show.
People get money to appear on
stage, but bears get Kool-aid.

It was time. Victor made ‘quick
work of his ﬁrst two opponents. He
tossed them around, then fell on
top of them. There wasn’t much
they could do about it.

The crowd loved it. There were
wild cheers and whistles every time
the bear sent someone spinning
onto the floor, and they erupted in
a roar of near-insane pleasure
when Victor got on top ofthem for a
victory.

My turn. The strategy was--don’t
worry about winning--just try not to
lose.

I stepped up to the broad-gutted
pile of fur, and grabbed him under
the arms. Once I had a ﬁrm grip on

Uring:   . . .
BlLl. LeROY ORCHESTRA

the beast, I gently rocked and
danced around the ring. Victor just
soft-stepped around with me. \

Actually, it was starting to he a lot
of fun. Once in a while the bear
tried to trip me with his big feet,
but as long as I kept my footing and
clung to him, there wasn’t much
either of us could do. V

And he was a very friendly bear.
As we stumbled around the stage
together, Victor’s foot-long tongue
escaped from the muzzle over his
mouth, and he started licking my
face. I think he was enjoying
himself. ‘ ,

But the crowd didn’t like it. They
wanted blood, crunching bones--a
modern day bear-bait with me
playing the dog.’ “Get him.
Trounce on him,” they shouted to
me and the bear simultaneously.

Then Tuffy, standing on the
sidelines, yelled over to me.
“You’ve got him now. Get him in a
headlock. Get him in a headlock.”

Victory. Glory. Maybe my
picture in Sports Illustrated. These
things flashed through my mind--
maybe I could beat him. Yes. I
could. Iwould.

The crowds cheered. I savagely
grabbed Victor around the neck.-
This was it, old chum.

In a fraction of a second, I was on_

the ground and my bones creaked
under the immense weight of the

' .

_1.._

Victor. I couldn’t move. After
squirming around under the 400
pound fur piece for a few minutes,
Tuffy got his friend off me. It was
all over in a matterof minutes.

The crowd cheered. Wildly.

Victor has wrestled over 60,000
people, Tuffy Truesdale told me,
his challengers ranging in age from
19 months to 60 years old. And
there have never been any injuries
worse than a few skinned fingers or
pulled muscles.

He has fought and beat many
professional wrestlers, including
Haystack Calhoun and “just about
all the pros--except the ones afraid
to wrestle him.”

Truesdell, himself a middle-
weight champ for three years,
ﬁgures Victor only has three years
of wrestling left in him. As the
bear lay down in the large black
airport limousine backstage, which
is his home when he’s on the road,
he did look a little tired. But not
too tired to munch on a box full of
apples and gloat ‘over his victories.

’ Next year, Victor will be back to
the Civic Arena, maybe with a‘

seven foot friend. And you can bet
the crowds, as they gorge them-
selves on succulent hot dogs
roasted to a crisp, will‘ be there
too--cheering maniacally-, fanned
by air conditioners.

last November by Cabaret, which
played to record-breaking audi-
ences. Pantagleize is a minor
masterpiece by a little-known
Belgian playwright, Michael De-
Ghelderode. Bittersweet in its
style, Pantagleize is, as its
playwright suggests, “a farce to
make you sad.”

 B Revolution Returns to Pitt    

Tom Siegel as “Pantagleize” stars
in the play opening this week.
Photo by Wilson. '

.Written in 1929, the play is
political in that it deals with people
caught in violent mass movements.
It is also a profoundly human
drama which investigates the
problem of revolutionaries who

become tyrants, and tyrants who»
. become revolutionaries. .

Under the direction of David L.
Rinear, Tom Siegel stars as
Pantagleize in a unique, Chaplin-
esque interpretation of the charac-
ter. Among those co-starring in the
University Theatre production, are
Paul Binotto [Generallissimo],

Buffalo Bromberg [Blank], Wayne ‘

Claeren [Distinguished Counsel],
Toby Beckwith [Macboom], Vito
Zingerelli [Banger], Julie Quinio
[Rachel] and Jay Silverman
[Bamboola].

The production staff includes
Henry ‘Heymann, settings; Lynne‘
R. Hemmingway, costumes and
make-up; and Richard Knowles,
lights and technical direction.

335 pages. $10.00.

By his own admission.
zenty has forgiven the Hungarian
Communists for their treatment of
him during his imprisomnent from
1948 to 1950. As cardinal and
primate of Hungary. Mindszenty
was responsible for the religious
teaching of Hungarian Catholics.
and at the end of World War II.
when the Soviet Communists
moved into Hungary. Cardinal
Mindszenty and the Roman Church
stood directly in the path of
Conimunist reorganizations of the
1.000-year-old Hungarian nation.
.Mindzenty‘s Memoirs documents
the history of that reorganization,
and the related arrest and
imprisonment of the cardinal
himself. Communist efforts to

Minds- ‘

subvert Hungary and its church
began almost before the war
ended, with Communists attempt-
ing to ingratiate themselves with
Church leaders, while at the same
time placing obstacles in the way of
church operations. The Commun-
ists, led by Matyas Rakosi, deputy
premier of the Communist govern-
ment, planted false information in
various church-related schools in
clumsy attempts to ‘prove’ church-
organized conspiracies against the
new regime. In one case, details of
a search which ‘uncovered’ a
conspiracy were released in a
Communist newspaper before the
search took place. .
But the suppression of the church
was proceeding in various ways.
and Mindszenty knew that as the
principal religious leader of Hun-
gary he was in personal danger. In
November. 1948. he announced to
the world that if he were ever
imprisoned. he would never volun-

. ‘Oats Place High At 0SU  

BY RICK STOUFFER

, - Associate Sports Editor
V To say the Pitt Track team had a
good showing at the Ohio State
ﬂgfgelays is like saying Hank Aaron

hit a few home runs. Both were .

outstanding.

Taking only 16 contestants to
Columbus, the Tracksters placed a
‘remarkable 14 men in the top six
places. Not bad considering there
were over 400 competing.

“I think ‘as a whole the team did
an outstanding job despite the
dicaps,” said Assistant Track

 Coach Mike “Gus” Agostinella.

_Handicaps such as the building
itself. It looked ﬁne from the
outside but once inside proved

- drafty and more fit for the 4-H

club’s cattle show. Theptrack was
seven lanes, of which‘ the middle
two were great. The others sloped
downhill or were very bumpy.
Adverse conditions to say the least.

Karl Farmer gave Pitt its ﬁrst

performance in the 440 yard dash.
Starting out in the middle of the
pack he picked his way through the
jungle until the second lap when he
pulled away from the crowd and
won by a cool 10 yards..

“I ran my normal race today,”
said the smiling speedster. “I like
to lay back the ﬁrst lap to see what

' the competition is. going to do and

then come on'strong for the ﬁnal

1 lap. Ithought I ran a better race in

thetrials thanin the ﬁnals but the
time in the finals (48.5) proves me
wrong.”
“Sparkle” Markley ﬁnally lost a
Now before you throw
yourself in front of a truck "because
your hero lost consider he didn’t
run in the 1,000 run but the 880
instead, a race he is deﬁnitely not

used to. Still, he ﬁnished a close —-

third. ,

“It wasn’t a good race for me,”
said the unhappy-looking Markley.
“There was a lot of pushing and
shoving on the tight track but I
didn’t have any conﬁdence in my
speed either. I deﬁnitely need more
speed in my workouts.”

One of the track men who doesn’t
get much publicity is Cuyler
. tikell, a long jumper who ﬁnished
ﬁfth at Columbus.

“Usually when I compete ‘my
steps are off going down W the
runway but today they were

hamstring last week and every time

I_ left the runway today II‘ had to let _‘

 

my legs hang in the air rather than
hitch (hitching is when a long

., jumper will look as if he is pedaling

a bike in the air before hitting the
pit). It started to hurt and I lost a lot
of momentum.”

The philosopher-poet of the track
team, Chuck Mozingo continued
his ‘late season charge ﬁnishing
second at OSU with a 1:11.0 time,
one tenth of a second behind
winner Mark Webster of Air Force.

‘‘I guess I should be happy I ran
so well,” said the ﬂoppy-haired
senior. “My time ‘was only a tenth
off my best all year but I didn’t plan
to take second. I thought I could
catch Webster but I didn’t have any
power at the end. Practices went

well but I couldn’t take“ him when it

counted.” _ .

Keith Taylor, another member of
the track team no one knows,
finished a strong ~ second at
Columbus in the triple jump, ‘his
best performance for a long time.

“My problem was I sat around
after warming up too early,” said
Taylor. “I felt good warming up
and thought I could hit at least 48
feet [he jumped 45’ 2”] but the
waiting part really threw me off.”

The last event of the day turned
out to be one of the most exciting
with Pitt’s mile ‘relay team
ﬁnishing fourth overall with a time

of 3:20.0. The relayers had ran 3:22 ‘

the week before with different
personnel and the midget track in
Madison. Square Garden.

“The mile relay wasn’t up to
where it’s capable of performing,”
said Agostinella. “Don Betterley
had a leg cramp and we substituted
Dan Schuerle ixrhis place, plus the
fact Lee Carter has bursitis in his
leg and is just gettingback to peak

_ form. With the experience the four

(including Mozingo and Farmer)
had._ thev did well. .

For the ,third consecutive year,
Pitt’s Legal Awareness-Commit'tee

(LAC) is sponsoring free income
tax assistance for all Pitt student

-provided through‘ the Volunteer

Income Tax Assistance Program
(VITA), an agency of the Internal
Revenue Service.

the IRS\will be available in 306 SU

to assist" students in ﬁling their’
returns. From January 30 to April I
15, the service will be open-from-
.noon to 4' pm Monday through“

“I think our young people did a
great job,” Agostinella continued.
“Boyd [who ﬁnished ﬁfth in the
two mile run] and MacDonald
[ﬁnishing sixth in the mile] fought
well through a big crowd of people.
They didn’t panic and kept their
heads. ‘

“Dan Goodyear is starting to
come back also. He’s had the ﬂu
twice and in between had a

‘ sprained ankle so he is performing

well under the circumstances.”
Perhaps Emperor “Woody”
Hayes should bequest some of his
annual millions to repair his
university’s track facility. But then
it doesn’t really matter. The
Panthers would only sweep the

field again.

Icers Crack Dukes, 28-3  

BY STEVE SYBERT

It’s been the habit of the Pitt
Hockey Club all season longsto get
off to slow starts then pick up
steam and go on to crush all of its
league opponents by game’s end.

The Panthers remained true to
form in their 8-3 conquest of
Duquesne Saturday at the Civic
Arena by blasting in four third
period goals to put away the Dukes

and run their record to 10-0 in the ,

Western Pennsylvania Intercolle-
giate Hockey Association. 1

Rick Vernon came through with
still another ‘hat trick, raising his
goal total to 39, .- while Charlie
Hagins and Val Troy added two
apiece along with Joe Testa’s
single tally.

Excellent teamwork allowed the
Panthers to open the scoring with-a
short-handed goal with 4:44 gone

a penalty to Jeff Saunders, de-
fenseman Russ Stump found Ver-
non open. at the blue-line. Vernon
riﬂed a shot which Duquesne
goaltender Eric Settler saved, but
Troy cashed in on the rebound for
his eighth goal of the year.

The score remained 1-0 until
Vernon slapped in a power play
goal at the 11:31 mark, but the

,Dukes’ Dave "Barbe came right

back a minute later, deﬂectlng a
shot off a Pitt player’s leg and into
the net. ‘

Thirty seconds later Vernon put
the Panthers on top 3-1 by ﬂipping »
a close-in shot by. Settler following
passes by Troy and Hagins. 2

Action in the second period turned
to close checking by both teams
with only one puck reaching the
net. Hagins put a good fake on a
Duquesne defenseman and ﬂipped
a shot between his legs and by the

  (it-applers Third InEastl

BY JIM SPANOS

Psychologists say repeated con-
tact with an object increases
attention towards that object. If
they are right George‘ Bryant has
taken a liking to trophies. In the
last two years Bryant has certainly
had enough contact with them, last
year winning the 118 pound class at
the Eastern Championships and on
Saturday capturing the 126 pound

1 crown.

Bryant's heroics led the Panthers
to a third place ﬁnish, behind
Lehigh and second place ﬁnisher
Navy. The Cats, who scored 109‘/2
points, were outscored by one-point

by Navy, and placed far behind .
_Lehigh, who grabbed 172‘/2 points.

Bryant, a senior All-American,
defeated Marty Lynn of Lehigh by a
15-8 score in the ﬁnals and must
now prepare for the National
Championships to be held on
March 13-15 in Jadwin Gymnasium
on the Princeton campus. But
Bryant won't be the only Panther to

‘ journey east of the Delaware.

He’ll be accompanied by team-
mates Rande Stottlemyer, Bill
Bailey, George O’Kom, Craig
Evans,‘ and Bill Korth. ‘each of

I : ‘whom also placed in the top four

finishers in their respective weight
classes, which qualiﬁed them for
the Nationals.

Stottlemyer placed second in the
134 competition, losing only to
I.ehigh’s Mike Frick in the ﬁnals by
a 16-8 score. He defeated Mike
Farley of Colgate, Jeff Thorne of
Penn, and Tom Bauer of Navy prior
to his encounter with Frick.

Korth placed fourth, losing to Pat
Sculley of Lehigh, beating Scott
Perkins of Colgate, Chris Ianocone
of Temple, and Charles Allen of
Army. In the consolation match,
Korth was defeated by’ Dennis
Undekoffer of Princeton.

George O’Korn also « placed
fourth, winning three matches and
losing two, the ﬁnal match to Tim
Jenks of Syracuse.

Craig Evans, at 177, came in
third, losing to Ken Goodrow of
Navy in the second round, then
defeating Goodrow _in the consola-
tion ﬁnal match. You may only go
around once drinking beer, but not
in wrestling. , _

190 pounder Bill Bailey captured a
fourth, also winning three and
losing two. A loss to Neal Brendell
of Yale prevented Bailey from
capturing third place.

Panthers who didn't qualify for.

the Nationals were Kevin Nellis
(118), who came in fifth, Skip Bolin
(150), who placed sixth, John
Chatman, who also came in ﬁfth,
and Carl Roba--you guessed it. He
too came in ﬁfth.

Head coach Dave Adams has to be
a proud man. His team was the
only one of the ﬁfteen participating
to place all ten men in the top six in
each weight class. ‘

“All year long,” said Adams, “I
knew we had‘ a good team. We
wrestled better down there [Anna-
polis] than we have all year,
although we were ‘disappointed we
didn’t come in second.”

“I’ll tell you--one thing, though,
nobody was going to beat Lehigh.
Not even with a club,” he said.
“But I did have a lot of conﬁdence
in our guys.” ‘

The guys will have to have a lot of
confidence in themselves at
Princeton. There will be 37
wrestlers in ‘each weight class
hoping to bring home a national
championship. V

  Gymnasts Lose Finale,

Look To Easterns

BY TOM HALL

Pitt’s Gymnastics squad, in their

ﬁnal meet before the Eastern
Championships, lost a close contest
to Army, 199.35-175.25, to ﬁnish
their season at 1-8.

The Panther’s chances to winxthe
meet were waylayed when Don
P Stevenson, one of four gymnasts
who was to attend the Eastems,
suffered a severe shoulder injury
midway through his third event.

“The injury is substantial,” said

Coach lg Perez. “Don had his arm’

in a sling for the rest of the meet,

and probably won't be able to ,

compete in the Easterns.”

The ‘loss ‘of Stevenson hurt the
Panthers on Saturday. He was
scheduled to compete in three more
events and might have raisedlthe

J‘, gymnasts score to around 198.

Rob Pasterick won the all-around
competition with 49 points. Gus
Papantonio, also from Pitt, finished
fourth. Rob’s best performances
came in victories in the ﬂoor
exercises, as well as a ﬁrst place in
vaulting, and the top spot in the
parallel bar exercises.

.“Rob’s performances in this meet
were very good.” Coach Perez had

more superlatives for his star

sophomore. “He is probably the
best all around athlete at Pitt. He
is only in hissophomore year, and

he is already ranked third in the.g'i;.V ,-—.

eastern league. ”

Pasterick slightly injured his knee
during the vaulting exercises,’
which limited him throughout the
rest of the meet. A “His perfor-
mances weregreat, and they might
have been better,” said Perez.

Highlight achievements were

turned in by Don Stevenson, who ‘

took a third in the side horse
exercises, and Pete Porzuczek who
ﬁnished fourth on the high bar with
an 8.3 score.

So after an improved season,

three gymnasts now head for the 

easterns.

“I’ll be‘ taking Rob Pasterick, Gus
Papantonio, and Mark Boyett. This ‘
is partially due to ﬁnancial reasons,
but mainly» because of the structure
of the competition. Everyone has
to perform compulsory olympic
routines, and these three along
with Don Stevenson are the only
ones I have capable of that,” Coach
Perez said. *

Larouche Best Rookie?  

BY CONNIE GIEL

The last month of regular season
play customarily yields much hy-
perbole.and superlatives in the
press releases from the 18 NHL
clubs ‘that boast of owning Cana-
da’s (and now the US’s) ﬁnest
hockey players. Every team is

mpcontending for something; be it the
 7‘ ’‘ian1ey Cup, a division title, or, in

.. case of the league’s newest
teams, Washington and Kansas
City--a hard-fought battle not to be
the worst.

But a competition of another sort
has been taking place since the
opening days of training camp--
perhaps even since last season.
This competition is every bit as
keen, as intense, as the champion-
ship races. It is, however, of
necessity less blatant, more subtle
and of a public relations nature. It
is the contention for the Calder
Memorial Trophy.

The trophy honors “the player

I. /-\-who is most proficient in his first

i
1

“year of competition in the NHL.”
That’s what the league says. That’s
what the writers and boradcasters
in the NHL cities who vote for the
rookies say. And that’s why the job
of the people who work in the front
ofﬁces of these same NHL clubs is
to make known the achievements of
their rookies.

It's too far into the season to bring
the dozens upon dozens of rookies
on club rosters out of the wood-

work. Only a handful of first-year
men are reallyvying for the award.
Which is not to say the competition
is neck and neck.

,,.,,_~Pittsburgh’s Pierre Larouche

7.

reads the pack with 51 points. The
19-year-old center tallied 21 goals
in rapid order, but has been shut
out for 10 games. His nearest
competitors "have been picking up

points regularly enought to make_

them formidable.

Danny Gare, a 20-year-old right
wing, is the second highest scorer
for Buffalo with 22 goals and 25
assists. Eric Vail of Atlanta also has
47 points-—he scores in bunches,
getting 2 goals in a game last week.
Other prime contenders include
three forwards and two defense-
men.

The two defensemen confuse the
situation. The race for the Calder
Memorial Trophy would seem
sometimes to be a small-scale
parallel of the race for the Art Ross
Trophy for league high scorer.

The rookie of the year should be
one of his team’s outstanding
players, a regular who challenged
the vets for a top line spot. These
specifications seem to point at
forwards. But last year’s Calder
Trophy winner was a defenseman.

Denis Potvin led the New York
Islanders in scoring with 17 goals
and 37 assists. His 54 points set a
scoring record for rookie defense-
men, breaking Bobby Orr’s oldone
of 13 goals and 41 points, set in the
’66-’67 season. The achievement in
itself is phemonenal, but rookie
forward Tom Lysiak also led his
team, Atlanta, in scoring with 64
points. Atlanta finished fourth in
the west division. The Islanders
were last in the east division. B

Potvin outpolled Lysiak by .14
points amid much argument. The
Flames gained a playoff spot while
the Islanders were left to nurse
their wounds and regroup for the
next season.

Previous results preclude gener-
alizations about this year’s rookies’
chances. Two goaltenders, Ken
Dryden of Montreal and Chicago’s
Tony Esposito, have won the award
in the last five years. Orr of Boston
was the last defenseman before
Potvin to take rookie honors. The

others in the last nine years have
been forwards. Steve Vickers, Gil
Perreault, Danny Grant and Derek
Sanderson are now all NHL stars.

All this means Larouche’s 51
points doesn’t guarantee anything.
But defensemen Ron Greschner of
the New York Rangers and Bob
Hess of the St. Louis Blues aren’t
guaranteed anything either. Gres-
chner has 36 points, Hess has 37.
Both played for the New West-
minster Bruins of the Western
Canada Hockey League last year.
Both were picked up in the amateur
draft. But this year neither has
excelled in the penalty department.
Greschner has 79 penalty minutes.
Hess has. 32. Potvin had 175.

So maybe Larouche, a forward, is
the leading contender after all. The
all-time leading scorer in Canadian
junior hockey, Larouche had 94
goals and 157 assists for 251 points
with the Sorel Black Hawks. Just 18
years old when he was drafted in-
the ﬁrst round ‘by the Pittsburgh
Penguins last year, Larouche now
centers the Pens’ exciting forward

line with wingers Bob Kelly and . ..

Chuck Arnason.

With just 16 regular season games
left, the rookies are getting more
ice time in which to display their
talents, and,“hopefully, score more
points. Larouche has appeared
more "often on Penguin power
plays. Vail and Gare are cashing in
on such opportunities frequently.

Although they say their eyes are
on the Stanley Cup contenders,
NHL fans are also following the
rookies. The clubs will soon focus
this gaze on their respective hot

' properties. The hyperbole will re-

cognize that the points speak for
themselves--but a little conversa-
tion never hurt any rookie’s
chances. -

revolution was brutally suppressed
in 1956, Mindszenty took refuge in
the American Embassy in Buda-
pest. He remained there until
September 29, 1971, when, by
arrangeme_nt with Hungarian,
American (including President
Richard M. Nixon) and Vatican
officials, he was driven to the
Vienna, Austria, airport and ﬂown
to Rome. After 13 years of
imprisonment or virtual house
arrest in the Embassy, the Cardinal
was free again.

As part of the arrangement under
which the Cardinal was permitted
to leave Hungary, Monsignor
Joszef Zagon of the Vatican had
visited Mindszenty in mid-summer
of 1971 to present four conditions
Mindszenty would
retain his title as chief churchman
of Hungary, but his duties would

be assigned to another bishop; he‘

would not be permitted to publish
statements or pastoral letters; once

abroad, he should make no‘

statements “that might disturb the

ernment or that might be offensive

to the Hungarian government of’
the People’s Republic”; and. he
was not to publish his memoirs, but
instead was to turn them over to
the Vatican, for publication at some
“appropriate time.”

Mindszenty accepted the first two
conditions, “declared unequivo-
cally" that he could not let the
“communist regime of Hungary...
be the judge of what I could or
could not say,” and succeeded in
persuading Monsignor Zagon that
his Memoirs contained “no ob-
stacles” to their publishment in
Mindszenty’s lifetime. \

Then Mindszenty left Hungary.
In the first 13 months after his
release, Mindszenty was informed
that “henceforth I must submit

‘every one of my statements, even

my sermons...” to a Vatican

censor; and that the Vatican had,
before the Cardinal’s release,
pledged to the Hungarian Govem-

‘ment that Mindszenty would “not

say or do anything that could
possibly displease that govem-
ment.” Mindszenty insisted that
he had made no such_pledge, and
that “Had I known about any
guarantee of this sort, I would...

have asked‘ the Holy Father to
rescind all the arrangements that
had been made in conjunction with
my departure from Hungary...”
In 1973, Cardinal Mindszenty
submitted his memoirs to the Pope,
who “did not object to anything in
the text.” The Pope did remind
Mindszenty that the Communists
might retaliate against Hungarian
Catholics if the Memoirs were
published, but Mindszenty replied
that “The Church simply cannot
make any conciliatory gesture in

the expectation that the regime 

in return abandon its persecution 
religion.” On November 1, 1973,
Mindszenty was asked to resign his
office in Hungary, but refused
because he believed his replace-
ment would be chosen with the

consent of the Hungarian Com-

munist Bureau of Church Affairs,
and so “would contribute to
legitimizing the present catastro-

_phic conditions in Hungary.”

On December 18, 1973, the Pope,
informed Cardinal Mindszenty that
the Cardinal’s'position in Hungary
was being declared vacant.

conjunction with So1zhenitsyn’s,</

novel, Memoirs gives us a painful
and often shocking composite of
life under the communist system--
all the more so because Mindszenty
and Solzhenitsyn are well within
the lifetimes of most of us.
