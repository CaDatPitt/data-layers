Officials Answer Questions On Policy

by LEETERKEL

The growth of student unrest on campuses. last year, prompted the State Legisla-
ture to pass certain laws aimed at stifling such disquiet. Outraged. some universities sent
representatives to Harrisburg to lobby against the proposed measures. They were not
entirely successful.

A state law now requires our University to submit to the Pennyslvania Higher Ed-
ucation Assistance Agency (PHEAA) the name of any student who fits in any of these
categories:

(1) If he is expelled by the University for committing an act which contributed to
the disruption of normal university activities (eg. an unlawful political demonstration).

(2) If he is convicted in a court of record of a felony or of a misdemeanor involv-
ing moral turpitude. P ‘

(3) If he is convicted in a court of record of any offense involving the disruption of
normal university activities.

Lat March the administration signedan agreement with the PHEAA, requiring the

, iwllniversity to comply with the provisions of this law. The Pitt News foundout about this
I last week.

A highly placed administration official (who wished to remain anonymous) offered
reasons to justify the Universitys decision.

“First of all, the University sent people to Harrisburg last year to inform the leg-

islature of our opposition to any bill put through in response to the student unrest on
campuses. ’

“We made it plain to them that we didn’t think that an institution of learning should
be used as an arm of a law enforcement body.

“However, once the law was on the books, we had no recourse but to comply."

What if the University refused to sign the agreement? The source went on to
explain:

“If we didn’t sign, the PHEAA would be forced to withdraw financial assistance
from our students who currently receive it. Since a high percentage of students get aid
from this agency, we judged that the effects of such a decision would be disastrous.”

Has the University submitted the names of any students expelled for a convicted
of the previously specified violations‘?

“To the best of our knowledge no one has been reported to the PHEAA. With re-
gard to disruptions on campus of a political nature, we think that it is highly improbable
that a major outbreak will occur on our campus.

“Although we are opposed in principle to some of the features of the law, we feel

University Explains PHEAA Ruling

The last comment ignores one key provision of the law: the University must re-
port any student convicted by a court of record of any crime which constituted a felony
or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. A student convicted of possession of nar-
cotics. a not too infrequent occurrence here, stands to lose his state financial aid.

The administration spokesman asserts that it is not the case that most university
students fall into these descriptive categories.

“We made the decision confident of the support of the great majority of our stu-
dents. Imagine the uproar which would have occurred if we hadn't signed. To a significant
percentage of our students, state aid is indispensable."

The spokesman was asked if the administration was so confident of student sup-
port, why did they cover in a cloak of secrecy their decision to sign the agreement? The
source went on to clarify:

“We did not, in any way, try to hush up the matter. The decision was purely admin-
istrative. It was passed through the proper channels and acted upon with a minimum of
fanfare. '

"We decided against giving undue publicity to our decision because we felt certain i

pressure groups would try to magnify and distort the consequences of our action. Sense-
less controversy would be created." »

Haverford was the only Pennsylvania college which refused to sign the compli-
ance. Since very few of their students are recipients of state, the college had little to lose
by testing the constitutionality of the law.

Jim Wolfe, the University’s lawyer. questioned the law's constitutionality. The
following is a summary of his conclusions:

——-—The law could be construed as discriminatory against the “poor” i.e. those students
students whose financial status is such that they require state aid. These students
are in a position to lose much more than students from a more affluent family.

——-—The law places penalties on a student who wishes to exercise his legal rights. For
example: a student who is tried and convicted in a magistrate court will not get
blacklisted. In this case the University is not technically required to submit his
name to the PHEAA since no record of proceedings is kept in court.

But if the student chooses to appeal to a higher court (where a record of‘proceed-
ings is kept). and if he losses his appeal, then the University must blacklist him. Such a
potential penalty may be judged as unconstitutional, it was explained.

The administrative interviews showed that the administration was very unhappy

that we will rarely, if ever, be placed in the position to carry it out. "

Environmental Action/Zero
Population Growth (EA/ZPG) is
fighting desparately to solve the
twin problems of pollution and
overover-population.

EA/ZPG, a national organiza-
tion structured by Senator Gay.-
lord Nelson (D.-Wisc.) in October
of 1969, presently has offices in
all 50 states and Canada. April
l-4’s Earth Day demonstrations
were the organization's first ac-
tivities in Pittsburgh. Its office in
the University of Pittsburgh Stu-
dent Union serves as the coordin-
ating office of EA/ZPG's activ-
ities for the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

EZ/ZPG would like to gain the
interest and support of all the citi-
zens of the Pittsburgh community
and the state as well.

“The major attemp of EA/ZPG
is to reach the undergraduates,
and graduates of the University
and the citizens of the entire com-
munity. The problems of pollution
extend far more than the univer-
sity community; it has to be the
concern of the state and nation,”
March Hiller, EA/ZPG’s coordi-
nator, explained.

The primary concern for 1970

 the Internal Combustion En’-

gine (ICE). The ICE in automo-
biles has caused 60 per cent of the
pollution problem.

A national effort is being sup-
ported from Sept. _g28j to

5‘

 

Oct. ' 5 to

focus on the problems if the ICE
and to educate the public of its
danger," Hiller reported.

EA/ZPG hopes to establish a
Pittsburgh Environmental Law
Society with the cooperation of
the Pitt and Duquesne Law
Schools.

It is also concerned about sav-
ing our natural environmefft from
destruction. Currently it is in-
volved in bringing litigation
the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation in an attempt to
salvage a 148 million acre wild-
life reserve in Murrysville, Pa..,
which will be demolished because

about the entire matter. The Haverford case is pending in a Philadelphia court..

of the construction of a f-our lane
highway.

The organization is involved in
stopping the placement of a pipe-
line deep beneath the Alaskan sur-
face.

“We have established commit-
tees to stop the Alaskan pipeline.
Petitions are being delivered to
President Nixon demanding that
he and the Secretary of Interior,
Walter Hickel, do further re-
search before permitting the pos-
sible devastation of America’s
last frontier,” Hiller asserted.

Hiller believes that education

V, of the public is a very iimpoprtant...

aspect of pollution control.

“We must make vigorous ef-
forts for education of the public
so that they become aware of all
aspects of the pollution problem,"
he maintained.

He also spoke of the possibility
of a lawsuit against a big Pitts-
burgh polluter.

“Research is currently being
done studying the feasibility of
filing suit against Qakland’s num-
ber one polluter—-J&L Steel,” he
expounded.

“The problem of overpopula-
tion is just hitting the white mid-
dle class society. Many Ameri-
cans never realized the vast num-
ber of people going to bed hungry,
in America alone,” he said as he
reaffirmed EA/ZPG’s concern
for the over-population problem
in our country and the world.

\.

Environmental Action Outlines Plans

Hiller believes Pittsburgh has
the ability to solve its environ-
mental problems.

_ “Pete Flaherty has the possi-
bility to follow in the footsteps of
one of the most concerned urban
environmentalists today — John
Lindsay. We are hopeful that May-
or Flaherty will help the citizens
‘of Pittsburgh rid themselves of
the pollution problem that we
have had for the past 50 years.
He’s got the opportunity; we hope
he uses it,” Hiller said.

Hiller finally asserted that the
answer to pollution and over-pop-
ulation will come only if everyone
works to achieve it.

“It is a problem that we all
have to work together on — the
businessman, the worker, the stu-
dent—if we are to save our _,coun-
try and the planet earth as well,”
he concluded.

C-MU Conference Hits On Politics

V, OOPS Spurs Involvement

uation," substantially the tradi-
tional requirement.

“The English department is al-
lowing this freedom of choice,"
said the department chairman,
Dr. Walter Everett, “in order
to allow students to remove them-
selves from competitive aspects
of education. The English depart-
ment believes that in taking this
position it is implementing Cred-
it/No Entry “in the spirit in
in which it was inaugurated.

“If we're going to have it,” said
Dr. Everett, “let’s have it all the
way. The department is regard-
ing the question of to have or not
to have a grade as being up to the
student.”

The Political Science depart-
ment looks at Credit/No Entry

   

from a different perspective.

Dr. William Keefe, chairman
of the department said that the
old requirement is being kept be-
cause of the increasing competi-
tion for places in graduate schools.

“Grades are only one factor

‘ considered,” said Dr. Keefe, “but

they are regarded as a more or
less objective evaluation. Letters
tend to become stereotyped.

“If Credit/No Entry were to
become prevalent I think you
would see the Graduate Rectﬂ»
Exams becoming more important
in admission to graduate schools.

The Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences, Jerome Schnee-
wind remarked that Credit/No
Entry was implemented to mini-
mize the traditional grading sys-
tem.

The special workshop. originally
designed for freshmen is now

possible for the student.“

The 11 instructors (including
eight student volunteers) will be
aided by electronic devices. in-
cluding films. overhead projec-

From A Reader
Donatelli “Inconsistent”

Editor, The Pitt News:

In response to Frank Donatelli’s article Conservative Rebirth in
the Sept. 16 issue of The Pitt News the following comment is in order.
The article deals with a conference of young conservatives and Mr.
Donatelli states that these students “stand for Western civilization,
the American tradition, and the freedom of the individual from arbi-
trary force."

Later on in the article Donatelli makes the statement “leaving be-
hind the cliches of the left, the discussions and debates among the dif-
ferent factions of the American right were in abundance here.” Several
points are immediately obvious.

First, Donatelli is well aware of the fact that the “American right”
is not homogeneous but consists of people of very different political
viewpoints.

Why then does he not make the same appraisal of the left? Instead
he accuses the left of being a group that relies on cliches rather than
rational arguement. Furthermore, the first statement I quoted (above)
of Donatelli’s looks not like one cliche, but like a whole collection of
cliches. '

My last reply to Donatelli was in the same spirit as this one—that
is, to show that Donatelli is guilty of many of the faults that he is so
free to accuse his opponents of.

The final sentence in the article is the following: “What I hope
groups like YAF can accomplish is to offer another point view to Amer-
ican youth and in the process restore balance and sanity to higher
education.”

This is indeed a nobel aspiration, but let us compare it with an-
other statement which appeared earlier in the same article: “the con-
servative members of the YAF conference) were more willing to lis-
ten other opinions rather than shouting them down.” The first sen-
tence (quoted above) uses the word “sanity” in a way that makes it im-
plicit that Donatelli is accusing the left of being insane.

Anyone who thinks my interpretation of this passage is incorrect,
need only consult the last letter of Donatelli’s that I attacked where his

It is immediately apparent to
anyone that the way to promote
rational discussion is not to call
one’s opponents insane (or to ac-
'cuse them of living in a dream
world). This, then, does not fit
smoothly with Donatelli’s ex-
ed wish to “listen to other opin-
ions rather than shouting them
down.”

One gets the impression that

In an apparent disdain for the
middle class culture in Amerika
with which they have broken ties,
many “freaks” have adopted a
different life style every bit as
bourgeois.

Seeing themselves as liberated
from the oppressive mores of
Western society, they assume a
very‘ smug and elitist attitude to-
ward other peoples in general.

It amuses them, for instance,
to see a man or woman being re-
duced to a nine to five machine in
a factory. “Many, you gotta be
really fucked to put up with that
kind of bullshit.”

TOO EASY

This is a fairly easy statement
to make when your basic necesi-
ties of life are taken care of by
your parents. However, a male
factory worker who has a wife
and two children to support does
not have the luxury of spending
the afternoon getting high and
tossing a frisbe in the park. He is
a wage slave. If he does not work,
his family does not eat.

from want are the fruit of peoples‘
labor. The clothes you wear, the
food you eat, the shelter in which
you live are all due to the ener-
gies of the working class people

of the world. You have produced

nothing and made no contribution

necessities of life for you. Your

This is not to say that the criti-
cisms of Amerikan society are
wrong. Place the blame, however,
where it belongs. The creation of
artificial needs in people by put-
ting them uptight about vanity

and body functions is a way to A

make more profits.

Employ psychology to sell
breath sprays, deodorants of dif-
ferent varieties, thousands of
varying cosmetics, etc. It is good

business, just like the war. For
good business is what makes

profits at whatever expense to the "

people involved. »

_“Doing your own thing” is so-
cially irresponsible. We have been
privileged in being free from the
struggle for basic necessities of

hungry.

We are privileged in having the
benefit of a college education no
matter how stifling and regres-
sive it may be. We have a duty to
aid oppressed peoples in their
struggles for freedom.

Our education can be of great
value in helping them to under-
stand how to liberate society and
all of us from the irrationality of
capitalism.

“Doing your own thing” is the
philosophical essence of capitalist
selfishness and social irresponsi-
bility.

"We definitely missed Cind-
rich.“ DePasqua said. “He plays
an important part in our defen-
sive alignment. It's also espe-
cially rough when you're making
replacements with sophomores."

Three weeks ago, after the
Panthers’ initial practice on the
Stadiums Astro—Turf, Cindrich
speculated about the possibility
of an injury on the synthetic sur-
face. He realized that some day
he could conceivably stick his

cleats into the Astro-Turf and
twist his knee. Yet, he considered
the traction something that he
would adjust to in a short time.

“The thing that really bothers
me,” Cindrich remarked Satur-
day, “is that I didn’t even get bit.
If I had gotten hit real hard, I
could have consideredit just part
of the game.”

Two additional aspects re-
strained the Panthers 1970 come

UCLA's lead to a few points early
in the final quarter.

But Not With The Press 25

  Hogan, Not DePasqua, Should
Be Playing Games In Future

   

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Minutes after Saturday’s Panther loss to UCLA

3 Carl DePasqua was sitting in hissmall office in the
* Pitt locker room talking to sportswriters via tele-

phone.
“I started Hogan,” he told the writers who were

 still in the press box. “I thought you should have
V been able to interpret that.”

Exactly what the sportswriters wanted inter-

preted wasn't clear to another band of writers
. cramped in DePasqua’s office, but it was evident

that DePasqua was still playing games with the
press.

Last week the Panther coach delivered confus-

ing answers concerning his selection for starting
1 . Pitt quarterback agains the Bruins. He finally chose

Charleroi sophomore John Hogan over junior Dave

. Havern, and the decision seemed to be the right

one as Hogan completed 29 of 47 pass attempts for

_ 299 yards in his first college game. He also threw
 a touchdown pass and ran for a score.

The completions equaled a Pitt record held by
Havern. who connected on 29 passes against Penn

State two years ago when he was Pitt's top signal

caller.
DePasqua continued the fun and games with the

reporters. though his general mood was far from

happiness after the defeat. He hung up the phone
and turned to the gathering in his office for more

A questions, but refused to say when he made his final

decision on Hogan.
“When did I decide?“ he repeated the question.

I  ‘“Let’s say I decided before game time.

About the time the coach was dodging the an-
swers, Hogan was athis locker buttoning his sports

Panther 37. Reggie Echols made
_ a diving catch of a Dennis Dum-
mit pass on the next play, one
" yard from the Pitt goal. Dummit
_ then dove into the end zone for
 UCLA's 24th point.

“You’re apt to have fumbles on
this turf,” DePasqua comment-
ed. “The backs have such great
cutting ability that they’re con-
stantly squirming to make a few
extra yards. It’s easy to see how
the ball can be knocked away.”

DePasqua blamed poor field
position. Everything went great.
We had them off balance in the
first half,” DePasqua remarked.
“Then in the second half we had
poor damn field position. A de-
fense can be tough and reckless in
that situation.”

 

quarterback hasn’t been playing games with the
press, so he didn’t feel free to avoid the answer to a
question on many minds.

“Three minutes before the game,” Hogan esti-
mated as the first time he had heard that he was
starting. Not much notice, but apparently Hogan
wasn’t affected much, as he went on to be named
the game’s outstanding offensive player.

“It showed, I guess, in a way that it didn’t bother
me," he agreed. “But I would have rather known."

Not knowing he would start, Hogan naturally
didn’t expect to throw as often as he did. But after
the performance he still didn’t expect to be told that
he had thrown as many times.

“You know, I thought maybe 30," he said. “I nev-
er thought of anything like 47.’ '

The 47 attempts missed another Havern rec-
ord. Against Penn State when Havern completed
29 passes“, he also set a Panther record for attempts
with 51. But for Hogan, who would have called 35 a
lot at Monogahela Valley Catholic High Schoo, the
47 was a personal high. He even admitted after-
wards that he probably threw too often, particularly
in the second half when 25 tries failed to producela
score. ‘

Throwing almost all the time, as the Panthers
did in the second half, doesn’t necessarily win ball
games. But Hogan’s attempts were on target

. enough to keep a job he won in practice.

Before deciding on Hogan—as least it's assumed
it was before the selection—DePasqua‘s argument
against the Charleroi quaterback was that he lack-
ed experience and possibly the poise one gains with
it. After the UCLA game such worries may be gone.

“That sophomore did ‘a tremendous job,“ _De-
Pasqua said. smiling about something ali‘tt1e‘mo,re
important than playing games with reporters.

Even though, the Panthers suf-

quarterback John Hogan contin-
ued his aerial assault against the
Bruin defense. He finished the
first half with 16 completions in
22 attempts for 193 yards. How-

Harriers Progress Well

by MARTY HELLMAN

All coaches lives would be easy if their respective squads pos-
sessed athletes who were hard working, enthusiastic, and potentially

winners.

Coach Jim Banner of the Pitt cross country team finds himself in

such an inviable position this year.

“This is the most pleasant fall training that I have had since I
became a head coach her,” he remarked. “Everything is coming along

real good.”

Banner, in his fourth year
of handling the barriers, attri-
butes this attitude to two main
reasons. The squad has two
extra weeks of training this
season as opposed to past years.
Also, the spirit of the team mem-
bers has been exceptional.

"We’ve been able to train the
way cross country training

Girls’ Tennis

Team Swings

At Chatham

The phrase “little opposition"
won’t be used to describe the
tennis team‘s challengers today
at Chatham.

“We expect a much stronger
match,” stated Dr. “Goldie”
Edwards, Pitt's coach. “Last
Wednesday’s matches were very
easy victories." Pitt defeated
CMU (4-1) in the first tourna-
ment of the season. The team’s
only loss in the match was by a
close margin (4-6. 2-6) to CMU’s
number one player, Peggy John-
son.

Last season Pitt lost one and
tied one with Chatham, (2-2, 2-3),
who is ranked very high for
women's varsity tennis in the
East. “Chatham, Wheeling, and
Slippery Rock are anticipated
to be our three main rivals." Dr.
Edwards commented. “I don’t
know much about Chatham‘s
team this year but they are bound
to be good.“ Pitt‘s lineup for the
singles will be Eileen Surdoval
(No. 1), Elain Kingas (No. 2)
and Joann Kotjan (No. 3). The
match starts at 4 p.m. at Chatham.

should be done," he comment-
ed. “Because we don’t have any
early meets, the pressure has
been off and we have been able
to train nice and slow."

Banner feels that the longer
training period has had a direct
effect on the barriers.

"Everybody is -working very,
very hard and I can see that
they are really enjoying them-
selves." he explained.

“They have a tremendous
team price; you can see it in
the number of miles logged
by each man.”

This week Bannerpredicts
that some of the men will be
doing over 140 miles in work-
outs while the others will be
running between 100-140 miles.

“I find that were coming
along real well with our endur-
ance." he said. and we‘ve just
started to work on pace training
the past couple of days. “

For pace work, Banner has
the barriers sprint up and down
Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park

after they have run several
miles on the course.
So far, no one on the team

has suffered a major injury.

“A few of them have small
blisters." he remarked. “but
everything has been on the min-
or scale."

Banner expects things like blis-
ters and tendon sores to crop
up in the runners because of the

large amount of miles that they
have all been compiling.

The first meet of the season
is against Cleveland State on
September 30th. Banner plans to
run the entire squad in this
meet and thereby give everyone
a chance to prove himself for
the later meets where only a
certain number can run.

"It's going to be very hard
on them because of the number
of good runners that we have."
he said. "Whoever does best in
the first couple of meets will
probably be the starters for the
last couple of races."

Two changes have been made
in the harriers schedule. The
Notre Dame Invitational will be
run on October 9th, while the
away meet against WVU will
3 be on Oct. 16.

Many of the harriers realize
the closeness within the ranks
of the team and they are put-
ting_out extra effort.

"Because they are a veteran
team." Banner explained. "they
are going out and getting a
little more mileage on their
own.“

that we play under tremendous
pressure.

"They had an edge on us in
speed and finesse. "

The coach thought that his
new defense was very success-
ful against the Zips.

The former 4-2-4 defense
would have enabled Akron to
dominate the center of the field
and force Pitt into a defensive
posture from which they couldn't
retreat.

The 4-3-4 defense allowed
the booters to assume a more
flexible position and chalk up
a respectible score.

The Zips opened the scoring
with a goal by Richard Parkinson
with 18:32 remaining in the

Sharpshooters Hurting
As "70 Season Nears

by STEVE ZYCH

After, having lost two thirds
of last year's championship team
due to graduation and being un-
able to recruit this past summer
due to prior military commit-
ments at Indiantown Gap Mili-
tary Reservation, rookie rifle
coach Billy Fauzey has been
able to recruit about sixteen pro-
spective shooters in the short
space of a week.

But most of them have had
no previous experience. The best
of the batch are probably Lou
Kuchinic and Katie McFeeley.
Both averaged 99 out of 100
while in high school. Lou is a
graduate of Upper St. Clair
while Katie (sister of last year's
female rifler. Mary McFeeley)
is from Munhall, which cap-
tured the 1968-1969 W.P.l.A.L.

   
 

JUNIOR BRUCE BARRETT, a returning sharpshooter averaged the second

Championship in her junior

year.

In addition to Katie there are
two other girls on the rifle
team so far: Paula Albinini of
Canonsburg and “Tink" Ma-
taras of Highland Park, New
Jersey.

The status of the girls on the
team is, still uncertain as the
school has not yet made a final
decision on Fauzey’s request to
field a co-ed team this year.

If Athletic Director Assistants
Bob Rosborough or Walt Cum-
mins give the thumbs down on
the proposal then Pitt will be
the only school competing in the
Western Pennsylvania Intercol-
legiate Rifle Conference barring
girls from competition. The
Conference permits girls to
shoot on a team if the school
also agrees to do so. All the

highest scores of all the returning lettermen on the Pitt Rifle team. The
team itself has lost almost two-thirds of its I969 roster and is now in the

process of rebuilding.

other schools in the rifle loop
have already agreed.

With or without the girls, the
riflers could have a rough time
of it this year as their top rival
for the crown - and last year's
co-champ - Indiana lost only two
shooters through graduation. In
addition, Indiana .boasts two
shooters who average above the
270’s which is a phenomenal
score. The best Pitt can offer
with John Taucher gone (267)
is Bill Crooks and Bruce Bar-
rett who average around 250.

Thus, unless some of the re-
cruits can adequately plug the
vacancies created by the loss
of Taucher and company the
Pitt rifle team might have a
tough time of it trying to re-
peat as champs this season. The
recruits are: Paula Albinini
(junior), Howie Ashbrook (fresh-
man), Jim Berthold (junior), Gary
Diesing (sophomore), Jay Fried-
berg (freshman), Reggie Fritsch
(freshman), Wally Komoot (soph-

omore), Lou Kuchinic (fresh-
man), Jim Kuhn (freshman),
Katie McFeeley (freshman) ,
“Tink” Mataras (junior), Bob
Olson (freshman), Joe Schul-

theis (senior), Glen Shaw (jun-
ior), Dave Snyder (freshman),
