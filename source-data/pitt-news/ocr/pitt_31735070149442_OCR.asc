Adams
leads
Pitt past
Cincinnati

Sparked by a dominating second
half, the Pitt men’s basketball team
rallied past Cincinnati for its 20th
victory of the season.’

With the 62-52 win at the Fifth
Third Arena, the Panthers have
now won three in a row and seven
of their last eight games. Cincinnati
has now lost two in a row after fall-
ing to Providence last Wednesday.

In Pitt’s previous contest against
Cincinnati, the Bearcats rallied in
the second half for the win. This
time, Pitt ﬂipped the script, out-
scoring Cincinnati 36-21 in the
second half to earn its impressive
road to victory. ' .

After the game, Pitt senior point
guard Tray Woodall expressed sat-

isfaction that the Panthers notched A

a 20th win for the 12th-consecutive
season, but saidhis_ team still has a
lot to play_ for.

“We’ve played a lot more games
than everybody else, but it’s good
to get 20 wins,” Woodall said. “But
that’s not really what our goal is.
We’Ve got eight wins in the con-
ference, but we’ve still got a lot to
prove. A lot of people kept saying
we couldn’t hang with the big boys,

_ or we can’t hang with the top—tier

teams in the Big East. But clearly
they don’t know what they’re talk-
ing about.”

But it didn’t look promising for

It’s 3:00 p.m. on a Sunday, and Tim
Larkin is keeled over on the ﬂoor of
the Cost Center. Moments before,
Larkin deftly swung a 70-pound
bag of sand back and forth over a
sprinter’s hurdle 27 times in one
minute. After completing this task,
Larkin took two steps before crum-
bling onto all fours and tipping
onto his back. A

“Man down,” Larkin’s girlfriend

and fellow Pitt junior Kasey Walls ‘

quipped as she watched, sitting

..

with her back against a nearby wall.
Following a series of dry-heav-

ing noises, Larkin was up on his.

feet and ready for what was next
in the third annual I <3 Strength
competition. Larkin was one of
29 competitors who took part in
the competition, which crowns
Pitt’s strongest man and strongest
woman. This year’s incarnation of
the event included four challenges:
the Tire Flip, the HexBar Farmer’s
Walk, the Tire Throw and the Sand-
bag Transfer. _

' Competitors were split up into
six separate divisions based on

. _A4i2A-648~ii?i53i"f*:

weight and gender. Each division
bore the name of a superhero."
The 140-pound female division,
for instance, was named Wonder
Woman, while the 165-pound male
division was named Spiderman.

Event organizer Sam Vescovi
said that the event was inspired by
a national strongwoman—strong-
man competition that used to air
on ESPN.

“They did things like holding
two pillars as they fell,” he said.

Vescovi and his team worked to
shrink down ESPN’s oversized con-
cept into something a little more

manageable for a university. The
goal was to retain the fun, full-body
workout associated with ESPN’s
competition. —
Vescovi explained that the 29
competitors included many pow-
erlifters and CrossFit trainers,
who focus on developing their
fast-twitch muscle ﬁbers for a more

- agile strength.

For the busy

Pat McAteer
News Editor

A new digital application that’s being devel-
oped by a group of Pitt students could free up
time for those on the run by “outsourcing”
everyday tasks.

Flippo is a start—up company that allows
students to pay other students to complete

simple tasks forthem, tasks including pur— ,

chasing and delivering food, providing trans-
portation and retrieving items left in campus
buildings, among others.

junior marketing major Alec Davis, Flippo’s
CEO, said he, along with senior Branden Kar-
nell and Pitt graduate Chirag Shah, began de-
veloping the program out of sheer practicality.

“On [Pitt’s] campus, there’s a lot of densely
packed places,” Davis said. “[Flippo] helps
facilitate the circulation of goods and services
on campus.” . .

Davis said Flippo is modeled after Task-
Rabbit, a website that’s blossoming in popu-
larity because of its convenience and the op-
portunity it presents in earning extra money.

February ll , 2018 I The Pitt News l \/w\/\/v;pittnevvs.cQm

Like Flippo, TaskRabbit allows its users to ‘
assign daily tasks to other people for varying
prices. As of now, the website has yet to gain
a foothold in Pittsburgh. According to the
TaskRabbit website, its services are available
in nine cities throughout the U.S.

But, unlike TaskRabbit, Davis said, users of
Flippo have the option of requesting services
or performing tasks for other users. ,

“Ours is unique in that it’s a two-sided
marketplace where college students can use it
to make money, and some can use it to request
services,” Davis said.

Students using Flippo put in a request for
a certain service, andanother student who’s
available can respond to the request. For ex- '
ample, if astudent wanted a pizza from Papa
Da Vinci’s brought to the Litchﬁeld Towers
lobby, that student could put in a request us-
ing Flippo and another student who’s willing
to perform the task would respond. ~

The student who requested the service

. would pay the respondent an amount that

correlates to the difﬁculty of the requested
service. These payments would be made

' According to the blog on Fli_ppo’s website,
in October the product entered a “market vali-
dation stage”, through which students could
put in requests using a Facebook group that
the co-founders created or through Google
Hotline. The Facebook group for Flippo Beta
had 121 members.

’ Students could also request a service by

' text messaging a certain phone number des- .

ignated by Flippo’s co-founders.
Flippo’s founders acknowledge that the
development of a digital application is a

time—consuming, yet rewarding, experience. »

Co-founder Karnell, a ﬁnance and general-
management major, said he spends between
two and three hours a day working on Flippo.
He said most of this time isspent promoting
Flippo by posting ﬂiers around campus and
updating its Facebook page. g

“We’re all keeping it on our minds all day,”
Karnell said. -

Karnell also said that he and the other co-
founders have thoroughly enjoyed Flippo’s

 

Pitt student, there’san app for that

development process and that watching the
project evolve has been rewarding.
Although Flippo has yet to launch, Davis
said it has already attracted attention from
Pitt’s student body. Last semester, he said,
he and the other Flippo co-founders ran a
test trial by using the Flippo formula on a

. Facebook page.

Brynn Yochim, asenior geology major, said
she initially learned of Flippo after one of her
Facebook friends “liked” the Flippo page. She
said Flippo’s logo, a hippopotamus performing
a front ﬂip, caught her eye. ‘

But, Yochim said, it’s Flippo’s purpose that
made her a regular visitor to its Facebook
page. -
“It just sounded like a very convenient
thing I needed to start learning about so I
could start using it,” she said, adding that she
used the service primarily for food. .

While it’s truethat Flippo is still in its
infancy, Davis says the operation has gone
rather smoothly thus far. He said costs have

gym rat. While the Tire Flip and Tire Throw
were geared more toward pure power-lifting
strength, the Sandbag Transfer and HexBar
Farmer’s_ Walk worked toward the CrossFit
trainers’ agility. I _ '

Once Larkin made his way over to Walls,
he was followed in the Sandbag Transfer
event by senior Andrew Krueger. With
his friend Max Reisman cheering him on,
Krueger was able to use his long arms — an
attribute that helped him ﬁnd success as a
four—year rower for Pitt’s crew team —- to
move the sandbags over the sprinter’s hurdle
over 40 times’. Larkin let out an audible, yet
playful, groan as his record was passed.

Krueger said his success in the event re-
sulted from training he’d done as part of Pitt
crew in the past.

“We used to do that kind of high intensity,

‘ just fast, workout,” Krueger said.

Many of the competition’s participants,
like Krueger, transferred experiencein other
sports to the I <3 Strength arena.

Senior Maddie Watton was a Olympic
trials qualiﬁer in short track speed skating
while in high school. She said the type of‘
intense workouts and training she partook
in preparation for this event mirrored the
intensity of workouts she completed for
speedskating in the past.

“This is the kind of trainingl do anyway,”
she said. ‘

Shae’ Felicien, also a senior, said she saw

A crossover effects to the I <3 Strength competi-

tion from her participation in judo and rugby.
“Judo prepared me for the fast-pace move-
ment [in the HexBar competition] ,” Felicien
said. . A
That preparation showed as Felicien scut-
tled between a series of large orange trafﬁc
cones, while holding a HexBar weight con-
traption that tipped the scales at 110 pounds .
For this year’s competition, Alexis Sand-

ers, an intern in Pitt’s intramural office, said 2

that the event’s organizers made a concerted
effort to draw more women to the Cost Cen-
ter. Ultimately, seven women registered for
the event. '

One of the women competing was senior
Arianna Hoffman. A trainer at LA Fitness in
her spare time, Hoffman chose to take part in
the I <3 Strength event as a way to test both
her mental and physical strength.

“People always perceive women as being
weak, but a lot of it’s mental,” Hoffman said.
“If you keep telling yourself that girls aren’t
strong enough, I’m not strong enough, then
you won’t be able to do it, but if you keep

pushing yourself, you’d be surprised what _

you’re capable of.” '_ _

Hoffman demonstrated her mental met-
tle, using her 5—foot—3—inch frame to push a
large" tractor tire about three-fourths her
height and weighing 300 pounds a distance
of 25 yards. ,

The top three competitors in each division
walked away from the event with a medal.

Triangle fraternity also left the event
with a trophy. Each year, the fraternity that
scores the highest in the competition as a

to strengthen his relationship with his fra-
ternity brothers. - . s
“It really helps us bond, spending two
hours working out together every morning

at7 a.m. Building brotherhood is important

tous,” Gargani said.

For some of the competitors, the trophy
was of only secondary concern.

Before the competition began, Walls
promised Larkin she would buy him a Sham-
rock Shake, a mint—ﬂavored milk shake from
McDonald’s, once the competition ended.

As the competition waned toward its end,
Larkin only had one thing on his mind. After
trudging over toward Walls on legs worn from
lifting HexBars and tires, Larkin uttered a
single sentence. .

“I need that Shamrock Shake,” he said.

been low because its team of developers have
agreed to accept equity, or stock in Flippo, as
compensation for their work. Additionally,
he said, since their advertising campaign has
been dominated by social media, expenses
have been kept in check.

More than 400 people have “liked” the

Flippo Facebook page. Its wall contains a num-
ber of pictures of satisﬁed customers who took
advantage of the website’s services during its
trial phase.

An even stronger advertising campaign
has resulted from Flippo test-run users simply
talking about its services. Yochim said she has

How the moral majority are

Jerry Falwell and company have weakened religion in America more than its opponents. MCT Campus

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opz'72z'072s Editogr

Today’s America isn’t as religious

as yesterday’s.

According to the Pew Forum
on Religion 8: Public Life, the
most rapidly growing religious
demographic is the religiously
unafﬁliated. These “nones” now
represent about 20 percent of all
U.S. adults. The under—30 crowd
is even more unaffiliated, with
nearly one-third expressing no
allegiance to any church.

This is not to say these un-
afﬁliated Americans are raging
atheists. Two—thirds of the non-
religious believe in God. One in
five say they pray every day. But
despite this,“the majority —— 88
percent — are not looking for

A any religion because they believe
. belonging to a church would not

grant them any greater serenity
or fulﬁlment.
These nones aren’t depressed.

They aren’t stuck in any deep in-
ternal conflict, questioning their
own existence. They haven’t been
inﬂuenced by Richard Dawkins
or Christopher Hitchens, crusad-
ing for rationalism. They have
a wide range of education and
ethnic backgrounds.

When nones are asked why
they dislike religion, about 70
percent say religious institutions
are too concerned with money
and power, too focused on rules
and too involved with politics.

Power, rules and politics. If
these are the culprits in the de-
mise of religion, then blame for
falling religiousness is easy to as-
sign. It isn’t the Internet. It isn’t a
wave of hedonism. It’s the politi-
cal activism of our parent’s gener-
ation that has destroyed religion
for so many young Americans.

The nones are a self-inﬂicted
wound.

The wound began opening
in the mid-20th century, when
business activists, intellectuals

and economists began search-
ing for a coalition to build a new
conservative majority. These men
believed the Franklin Roosevelt
years and post—war consensus had
led to high taxes and regulation
that would ultimately destroy the
free enterprise system.

As recounted in the book “In—
visible Hands” by New York Uni-
versity’s Kim Phillips—Fein, one
possible base to foster this new
political alignment were white,
working—class descendants of
Irish, Ita°lian or Eastern-Euro-
pean immigrants. Traditionally
religious, but with sympathies to
trade—unionism, they could be an
ally if conservatism was properly
packaged.

Activists began bombarding
Christian leaders with mailings
and conferences. Televangelist

CANDID REFLECTION

China’s dominance will keep the world secure and healthy

Daniel Okwaisie
Columnist

With the U.S. economy producing too few
high—paying jobs for young Americans,
many people joke about moving to China
for work. The Chinese know how to build
trains and manage an economy. The food
isn’t too bad either.

Pretty soon, moving to China won’t' -

even require leaving the world’s superpow-
er. With China’s economy growing faster
than ours, it will soon become the world’s
largest economy — just yesterday, it was
announced that it is already the world’s
largest trading nation.»

This is slowly marking a change in su-
perpower status. While we make claims
about military or cultural supremacy,
ultimately, the only thing that makes a
nation powerful is its economy. A strong
military in a receding economy is nothing
more than a tank parked on quicksand,
ﬁring shots. .

Will the world be happy when China
becomes the new superpower? In some
ways, yes. Despite that fact that hegemonic
U.S. inﬂuence for the last 30 years or so has
been by and large peaceful and that free-
dom and human dignity have undergone

advancements with many liberated from
tyranny and economic oppression, many
still harbor resentment toward George
Bush’s radical unilateralism.

This resentment is so strong that in the
first nine months of his successor’s first
term, he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize
for no other reason than that he was not
George Bush. '

But in fact, his successor has offered
little practical difference from Bush. He
has proceeded to strike even more people
than his predecessor did through drones
— a peaceful move only if you believe the
lifeof a 4-year-old Pakistani girl whose
limbs are torn off is intrinsically wo'rth
less than_her age—mate in Pittsburgh or
anywhere else in the U.S.

Terrorists are monsters who use a cen—,f

tral philosophy to justify the destruction
of lives. But in pursuing their defeat, it is
important to step back and refrain from
emulating the monsters we are trying to
defeat. With President Barack Obama’s
actions now cemented into foreign policy,

it is apparent that American military ag--

gression was not just a Bush problem, but
a deeper American problem: We barge into

other lands and put guns to heads, all while -

whispering how they are now free men.

China might offer a new, defensive su-
perpower model appropriate for a more
advanced society. The Chinese people are
more concerned about defending their
own land, which is not surprising, con-
sidering its history of multiple invasions
by foreign forces. The People’s Libera-
tion Army, though currently the biggest
military in the world in terms of person-
nel, is not technologically equipped to
U.S; levels, according to U.S. intelligence
reports. Although the uncertain levels of
PLA spending on military research and
development are rising, it seems clear they
are not pursuing the aggressive path pre-
ferred by.t_he Americans. '

China’s military rise poses little risk of
American-style forceful invasions. While
tensions with neighboringjapan have been
rising in recent months, the relationship in
recent weeks has been marked by peaceful
negotiation, so even here, fears of Chinese
aggression are again unfounded.

Simply put, the rise of China will coun-
terbalance the unilateral madness that
has plagued U.S._administrations since
Jimmy Carter. With a powerful 'PLA, we
will no longer just be one fanatical U.S.
president away. from being plunged into
irretrievable catastrophe.

China becoming the new superpower
also promises a massive improvement in
living standards all around the globe. With

~ one—fifth of the entire world’s population

living within its borders, China has moved
to build not military alliances, but eco-
nomic alliances. In 2009, China overtook
the U.S. as Brazil’s biggest trading-partner
and the very next year as Africa’s biggest
trading partner. In countries like Angola,
cities are gaining their own “Chinatowns”
as huge Chinese investments pouring in
are accompanied by large number of immi-

' grants. Chinese investment has improved

economic activities across the world.

Of course, China’s rise isn’t necessarily
going to be at the demise of the U.S. But
given a slowly aging population, content-
ment with a 2 percent growth rate, aggres-
sive and intolerant policies toward im-
migrants and an obsession with spending
billions on a military industrial complex to
contain other people’s expansion, the U.S.
is. slowly handing over the baton.

With China, the world will not only
have a superpower that will leave it alone,
but also one that focuses on what mat-
ters most: improving the economicliving
standards of humanity. I

litical matters to prevent the “tragedy” of

Christians not voting. The religious had’

become the religious right, aligned with
businesses to promote a smaller govern-
ment.

But by tying religiousness to a politi-
cal movement so tightly, religion was on
its way to becoming obsolete. It was also
on its way to adopting politics’ most dirty
traits: hypocrisy and oversimpliﬁcation.

This is antithetical to the broader re-
ligious history of the United States. For
much of the 19th century, churches were
small and community-based. Alexis de
Tocqueville noted that pastors were more

responsive to local communities than dis-
tant hierarchies and that citizens had mod-
eration and tolerance.

By being hyper—local, religion in
‘America was a marketplace. There was no
state church, and parishioners felt free to
change. Protestant pastors who didn’t want
to be out of a job had to tailor services and
practices to best match the people. Dogma
and doctrine played a smaller role than
community and common striving. It. was
the opposite of Europe, where centralized
state churches became deposits of crony—
ism and cynicism —~ the American reli-
gious experiehce was open and democratic.

But by tying religion so formally to
politics, with sermons devoted to speciﬁc
political goals rather than just broad mo-
rality, religion not only became grossly

oversimpliﬁed and anti—intellectual, but
also forever fixed to the political fortunes
of itsconservative ally. The Tocquevillian
landscape of small, responsive choices
has become an establishment religion of
Europe, with followers expected to hold
deeply to the same core political beliefs.

Thus, as conservatism has declined, re-
ligion has too. A more free, less—politically
motivated church might be surviving and
thriving. The broad Protestant baseﬂhas

At this point, it would be difficult to
detangle religion from politics. In the
minds of young Americans, the church

hierarchy of another age.

from political agendas. Formal comments
on policy should be stopped. Any endorse-

stopped.

This would return religion to its original
role in politics and society. Formally, it
would be nonexistent. It would only matter

insomuch as it is able to affect the minds

and hearts of parishioners. It would be a
more organic process.

America’s religious leaders should be
worried. Our generation is very apathetic
to religion. To continue as a positive force

Panthers suffer with turnover problems, lose at Louisville 

Dave Uhrmacher
Stcyff W rzrer

It is difficult enough to win on the
road against a top-15 opponent.
But it is nearly impossible to win
any game when a team turns the
ball over 26 times.

The Pitt women’s basketball
team could not overcome a sea-
son-high 26 turnovers Saturday,
losing to the No. 11 Louisville
Cardinals 78-45 at the KFC Yum!
Center to stretch the Panthers’
conference losing streak to 30
games. =
The Panthers (9-14, 0-10 Big
East) were led by sophomore
guard Brianna Kiesel’s 14-point
performance. Kiesel — starting
her 53rd-straight game for Pitt —
was the only Panther to achieve
double ﬁgures.

Pitt was unable to stop Louis-

ville (20-4, 8-2 Big East) on the_

offensive end, as ﬁve Cardinals
reached double ﬁgures. Junior
guard Shoni Schimmel recorded
a game—high 22 points. Teammate
Megan Deines converted all three
of her 3-point attempts and led the
Louisville bench with 17 points.

Junior forward Asia Logan did
not play for the Panthers. Her nag-
ging right-shoulder injury contin-
ues to keep Pitt’s leading scorer
out of the lineup.‘ '

The Pitt starting backcourt .

comprised of Kiesel and junior
Marquel Davis, who started at
point guard in place of injured

freshman Brittany Gordon, com— -

bined for 12 turnovers and only
two assists’. . ~

“We never even had the oppor-
tunity to score when you look at
26 turnovers,” head coach Agnus
Berenato said. “It is 26 chances
to score that you just don’t get.”

Credit must be given to the
Louisville defense, which executed
its plan to pressure the Panthers
very well. The Cardinals’ 14 steals
— compared to just six for Pitt

—— clearly affected the outcome I

of the game.
“They came out really aggres-
sive and were very sharp on the

ball,” Berenato said. “ [They were] e

trapping and pressing, and it re-
ally affected us.”

The Panthers’ struggle to de-
fend their own basket continued
as Louisville managed to score
half of its points in the paint, a

ﬁgurethat led them to shooting
nearly 50 percent from the ﬁeld.

Pitt managed to score almost
half of its 48 points in the paint as
well, but its shooting percentage
numbers were not quite as impres-
sive as the home team’s. Pitt shot
a lowly 16-for-45 (35.6 percent)
from the ﬁeld.

Oddly enough, -on a day the
Panthers were dominated by Lou-
isville’s inside scoring, Pitt actual-
ly won the rebounding battle, 34-
32. Berenato, obviously frustrated
with her team’s performance, was
still in disbelief over the rebound-

' ing numbers after the game.

“That number is shocking,”
she said. “I really cannot believe
we out-rebounded them. We have
been working hard on it. You take
16 points away from us with Asia
Logan out and look at their size.
[I] still cannot believe it.”

The Panthers have a week-long
hiatus before traveling to Syra-
cuse on Saturday, Feb. 16, for a
showdown with the No. 22 Syra-
cuse Orange. The game will be
featured as the Big East women’s
basketball game of the week and
will be broadcast on.the Big East

WORSE Of WRSGN

USA men’s soccer needs chemistry to

The Americans weren’t smiling after losing 2-1 at Honduras last Wednesday. MCT Campus

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

The U.S. men’s national soccer
team’s loss against Honduras in
its ﬁrst World Cup qualiﬁer of the
ﬁnal stage isn’t worrisome.

The 90-degree conditions in
San Pedro Sula were brutal and
playing on the road in a soccer-
crazed Latin American country is
never easy, so this defeat isn’t sur-
prising and perhaps should even
be the expectation. —

There’s no cause for panic.
The old idiom to take care of your
gameson home soil and snatch

jwhatever points you can on the
‘ road still holds true, and the Amer-

icans should still feel conﬁdent-
that they will qualify for the big-
gest sporting event in the world.

A But how they lost is concerning: .
' The team conceded the majority

qualifyfor World Cup .

of possessions and hardly ever;

threatened offensively en route to
a 2-1 defeat to start the six—team
Hexagonal round of qualifying
from the North and Central Ameri-
can Region known as CONCACAF.

On Wednesday in Honduras,

both teams took around the same"

number of shots, but the U.S.
only had two of those attempts
on frame.

Most evident during the match

was the lack of communication on

defense, especially on the Hondu‘-_ 

rans’ late winning goal. American
center back Omar Gonzalez, who
had never played in a World Cup
qualifying match, displayed some
lackadaisical defending to allow
Honduras forwardjerry Bengtson

to tap the ball into the net for the“

deciding goal with about 10 min-

Pitt came out sloppy as the Bearcats (18-
6, 6-5 Big East) grabbed a 21-13 lead after a
Sean Kilpatrick jumper with about eight min-
utes remaining in the ﬁrst half. Kjlpatrick, a
junior guard, led Cincinnati with 16 points.
The Panthers (20-5, 8-4 Big East) fought
back to tie it at 21, but Cincinnatifpunched
right back, taking a 31-26 lead into halftime.

Steven Adams started out the scoring in
the second half with a layup, setting the tone
for the rest of the game. Thefreshman center
was key in igniting Pitt’s success, ﬁnishing
his chances and spreading out the offense.
Adams ﬁnished with 13 points, shooting
5-for-6 from the ﬁeld and 3-for-4 from the
line. 4 -

Redshirt junior small forward Lamar Pat-
terson said that college basketball fans are

- ﬁnally starting to see the potential that Pitt’s

freshman center possesses.

“Steve has shown what he is really about.
Everyone has heard of what he can do, but
now he’s starting to show it,” Patterson said
of Adams. “He’s one of the most talented
big men, I think, in the country. That’s a big
statement for afreshman, but we are starting
to see the real Steve Adams now.” '

Pitt cut the lead to one point with 17 min-
utes left, but the Bearcats struck back, get-

_ ting the lead back up to ﬁve with 14 minutes

left.
After shedding the lead to three points or

seven minutes left on a Woodall 3-pointer.
The senior point guard led Pitt with 14 points
off 4-for-8 shooting. All four of his baskets
came from beyond the arc. '

less multiple times, Pitt ﬁnally tied it up with -

Then a layup by junior guard Trey Zeigler
gave Pitt the lead, but Cincinnati counter
punched to take the lead back at 48-47 with
ﬁve minutes remaining. 1

But that was the last lead the Bearcats
earned.

Woodall hit another clutch 3—pointer to
put Pitt up 54-48, and then redshirt junior
forward Talib Zanna converted a dunk off a
nifty pass from Adams. Zanna fell short of a

double—double, accumulating 11 points and‘

nine rebounds.

Pitt’s comeback was ﬁieled by, its stingy
defense, holding Cincinnati without a ﬁeld
goal’over the ﬁnal nine minutes and 21 sec-
onds. Over this stretch, Cincinnati missed its
last 14 shots, dropping them to 30.8 percent
from the ﬁeld —— a season low.

Cincinnati’s star guards, Kilpatrick- and
Cashmere Wright, both shot poorly. Kilpat—
rick shot 5-for-15, while Wright shot 2—for-12.

Head coach Jamie Dixon thought switch-
ing to a zone defense helped Pitt foil the Cin-
cinnati attack late in the game.

“In the second half we went to [the zone]
out of necessity and then just stayed with i ,”
Dixon said. “We wanted to limit their pene-
tration, which was the most important thing
for us.” I

For the ﬁfth game in ‘a row, Pitt won the
battle on the boards, out-rebounding Cincin-
nati 2’9-28. Pitt has only lost once, against
Louisville, when out-rebounding the opposi-
tion. I
The Panthers don’t play again until Sat-
urday when they face ranked Marquette at

home in a dramatic overtime contest when

utes left. p

These defensive mixups reﬂect poorly
on the team’s organization and coaching.

When he came on as coach back in July
2o11,Jurgen Klinsmann promised an appeal-
ing style of soccer, a breakaway from what
had often been derided as a drole, counter-
attack-heavy philosophy relied upon from
2006 to 2011 by former United States coach
Bob Bradley.

Style is a long-term issue that can’t be
ﬁxed suddenly, but at this point all that
should matter is getting results.

And yet, in the four away World Cup
qualiﬁers under Klinsmann, the Americans

 

, have taken the lead in all four games only

to lose eight of a potential 12 points — a
worrisome pattern.

A lack of chemistry in defense isn’t some-
thing that’s easily or quickly remedied at the
international level, especially when imple-
menting new faces such as Gonzalez and
right back Timmy Chandler.

Wednesday’s game was the ﬁrst World
Cup qualiﬁer for both players, so they are
raw internationally. They will develop and
gain the "necessary experience as the 10-
game qualifying round continues.

A quote from experienced American
goalkeeper Tim Howard about another in-
ternationally inexperienced player, Graham
Zusi, applies to all of these new players.

“Graham Zusi’s been brilliant for us,”
“Howard said. “Now we’ll see what it’s like
when he gets thrown in the cauldron [of the

Hexagonal]. We have no doubts about him, V

but that’s all part of it.” -
The Americans — both young and old

‘ — now need to focus on erasing the loss to

Honduras from their memories and picking
up points in qualifying. ,

The next qualiﬁer takes place March 22
in Colorado against Costa Rica. In the time
between now and then, players will return
to their clubs all over North America and Eu-
rope and settle back into their roles, which
are often different than those they are asked
to play for the national team. That is one of
the major challenges of international soc-
cer: creating team chemistry, something the
Americans appear to be lacking right now.

Immediately following the Costa Rica

game is atrip to the cavernous 104,000-seat-
er Azteca Stadium in Mexico City against
rival Mexico on March 26. These two games

V have the potential to cause more trouble for

Klinsmann’s squad, and the United States
will need to ﬁnd a way to pick up points to
avoid slippingdown the qualifying stand-
ings. , ’ .
‘The top three teams from the Hexagonal
automatically qualify for the World Cup in
2014 in Brazil, while the fourth‘-placed team
will play a two-legged playoff against the
qualiﬁer from Oceania —-— probably New
Zealand. , _

The United States still has a good chance

_ at advancing out of this group, but with the

strength of CONCACAF continuing to in-

   

crease —Jamaica’s surprising draw against
Mexico, for example — strong performances
both home and away are imperative.

The ability is there.

But the team’s form has been sporadic
as of late, and what’s going change that?

' With the messiah of American soccer,
Landon Donovan, on a self—imposed hiatus
from the sport until who knows when, the
U.S. needs several other players to step up.

Michael Bradley, the team’s stoic central
midﬁelder, appeared nonplussed about the
defeat.

“It’s not the way we wanted to start, but
it’s a long road. Nobody on our end expects
to go 10-0-0, and that’s the reality. There

and tough atmospheres. We have to continue
to keep a strong mentality, continue to have
the conﬁdence and continue to believe that
over 10‘ games, our quality will come out,”
Bradley said according to a release issued by
US Soccer. “When you’re playing in a situa5
tion like this where points are on the line,
you never want to start with zero, but you
can’t panic. There are nine more games to
go. We get a home game next, and we have
to look at things, improve things and know
that the three points in the next game are:

Belief is great, but it alone won’t be what
gets points and secures a spot for the United
States in Brazil next summer. I’ '
