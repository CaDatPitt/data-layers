Student Congress learned’

Monday that the student body
opposes common free hour to
beiused for activities."

Acting on the ﬁndings of a.
poll conducted by SC itself,
‘the congressmen voted not to
send a proposal to the Faculty

Senate Committee recommending

-that the ﬁfth hour be ‘set‘aside next *
.-semester as an activities hour.

~ —The. poll was headed by- Zora
Kukic and Bernie Wilchusky, ob-
servers to SC. They submitted the
results of the organization and stu-
dent voting with the recommenda-
tion that, although student opinion
was ‘against a common free hour,

. SC should continue investigating

its possibilities. , _
Organizations Polled
Wilchusky explained that let-

'ters were sent to 74 campus organ- .

izations asking for their opinions
concerning the ﬁfth hour proposal.
“Besides these letters, 600 ques-
tionnaires were printed and dis-
tributed to students asking them
point—blank_ if they favored the
free hour,” he said. ’

Of ithe'22 answers received from
the campus organizations, 14 op-
posed the proposal with six‘favor_-,
ing it and two. undecided. Students
voted 297 against and 156 for the
common free hour. Wilchusky
said he did not feel this vote in-
dicated the trend of the entire
student body. "

After the results of the poll were
revealed Ross Reese, recording
secretary-of SC, said he felt the
SC should back the proposal re-
gardless of the results of the poll.
He said, “In the end it would help
the students}?

SC Votes To Ifeep
Original Ball Date

June 5 will stand as the
Room Ball, Student Congress

date of the Senior Commons
social committee has decided.

Chairman Joe Marasco has announced that the com-

mittee balloted to keep the original date for

the dance with

one dissenting vote. A switch in
dates was under consideration af-
ter the possibility was brought up
that the dance might interfere
with, preparations for the‘ Senior
Queen "coronation. .
Lists Reasons

Listing reasons for keeping the
June date, Marasco said that if
the Commons Room Ball was mov-
ed up to a late May date, it would
be too’ close to the Spring Festival
Dance. Spring Festival was sched-
uled later this year to insure good
weather, Marasco added. ,

Marasco explained that May 29,
being considered as an alternate
date, fell before exam week and
interfered with Memorial Day. An
earlier May date which would
have to be before Spring Festival

taining that local seniors and jun-1
iors will support the dance June 5.
Offers Argument

Offering an argument against
opposition who believe the dance
will be unsuccessful, as it was
when it was inaugurated two
years ago, Marasco said th_e first
dance failed because it was too
expensive.

John" Ney has been appointed‘

chairman of the ball, Richard
J affe, business manager and Sam-
my Balk,‘ publicity chairman. Stu-
dents interested in working on
publicity or ticket committees are
asked to leave their names at the
Student Desk addressed to the
business’ manager, Senior Com-

First grratseries .   
A rtsA lm
By Norm BURZYNSKI

“Our aim isn’t to train pro-
fessional artists,” said Pro-
fessor Walter R.~Hovey, head

of the Fine Arts department.

“We’re only giving students
interested in ﬁne arts a well bal-
anced cultural background.” The
department’s comprehensive pro-
gram consists of integrating theory
and practice by study and inter-
pretation of the ‘art of the‘world.. -

To facilitate the process .of,
. learning ‘the
through the years developed, its .

department

own ideas in presenting its sub-
jects. Colored slides, photographs,
drawings, and the actual art ob-

jects are shown to the students).

_ There is the library with its art

books from all over the world; the

gallery with international exhibi- .

-tions’, and the department’s own
collections. »
Better Understanding‘

“Those are the tools we use in
helpingthe students to develop a
discriminating approach to art and
a betterunderstanding of the_sub-

ject,” Professor ‘I-Iovey, continued.

All of these techniques are used
throughout the department but

.esp_'ecially so in the beginning

courses.‘ There is where the basic
historical and philosophicali facts
and theories are ﬁrst taught. ’
. The selection and appreciation
of ﬁne art depends greatlyon com-

-municating in a_ tangible form. Or

as Robert Alexander, instructor of
ﬁne arts, says: “The students must
see a Grecian urn, a Rembrandt,
or a Venus to capture its meaning

" as well as its beauty in their

minds.” The department has been
able to accomplish this by a num-
ber of ways. _
Collections Accumulated
First of all thewﬁne arts depart-

'ment has accumulateda number of

collections and individual“ art
pieces from various sources. ‘Some
have been-donated by alumni and

 Pittsburghers. For instance there

is the George H. Clapp‘ collection

, of about.300 drawings of 16th to-

18th century Italian artists. Alan
Magee Scaife, president of A the

has ‘

 

  

 

University Board of ‘Trustees, re-
cently ”gave the department a
group of ,15th century stained

‘glass windows. "These are being

placed, in sets of four, in the win-
dows of the ‘photograph study
room. . '
Four Indeﬁnite Loans

In the hallway of the seventh
ﬂoor stand four art objects that
have apparently found a ﬁnal rest-
ing ‘place in the University. The
bust of Ivan Mestronic originally
contributed to the Yugoslavian
room is there on indeﬁnite loa'n.
On either side of the gallery en-
trance the Annunciation group,,a
Dossena imitation of the 14th cen-
tury Sienese style, is placed. These
and the apsidal fresco from a par-
ish church,‘a 15th, century Italian
ﬁgure of Christ, were presented to
the department by Miss Helen
Frick. _ ,

With these gifts and- other art
objects the department makes up
its own exhibitions to present in
the gallery as well as sending "them
on display to other schools and
foundations. Not all of the dis-
plays seen in the gallery originate

in the Uiiiversity. though.

_which» reaches ‘almost all the.

members of.the society. It also
serves to record the history [of

day to day. Accuracyiand ob-
jectivity in its reports are basic

requirements "of both of these. .

Peery’s Corps Hits Top

Pitt’s swimming and wrestling teams captured two inter-
collegiate championships Saturday, climaxing itsmostl suc-
cessful winter sports campaign since the pre-war era.

For the tankers, coached by Ben Grady, the victory in
the Eastern Collegiate Swimming Association meet at New
York University’s modern N atatorium was their second con-
sécutive sweep over Eastern powers.

At Cleveland, 0., the formidable wrestling team, built from
scratch four years ago by Coach Rex Peery, won. Pitt’s ﬁrst
mat title in the Intercollegiate Interstate Individual Invi-

national.

Tucking away their second

two consecutive years.

Ronnie Gainsford was the indi-

they ran up" 97 points, 27 more than
runnerup Lehigh, Pitt’s main op-
position.

Taking two. ﬁrsts—one_ with a

ONCE. there was a ghost named Leroy, who "lived in .a
haunted cottage near a large Eastern university. Every

Friday night,‘ at exactly seven
door of Baskerville Hall (the

o’clock, he’d slide under the
main dorm), and give the .

students all the answers to next weeks quizzes.
This was quite a set up. No studying, no cramming . . . and“

straight A’s all term long. But then, one Friday, the hour

camc and went. No Leroy! And the following week, all‘ the
Baskerville Boys got an F on every quiz!

The Friday after that, all of Baskervillc Hall waited . . ;
and waited. But still no Leroy! In high dudgcon, they set out
to ﬁnd him. Creeping into Lcroy’s haunted cottage . . . they
Baskcrvillc Boys found him moaning and groaning. “What’s

the matter, Leroy?” they asked.

Leroy wipcd\a ghostly tear from his ghostly eye. “The weath-
er’s so hot, every time I put on a shirt the collar curls and
wilts. I havcn’t been out for twowceks!” _

In high glee, the Baskervillc Boys hurried to the local

Van Heusen dealer and bought

a dozen Van Heusen Century

Shirts‘ with the’ revolutionary soft collar that‘won’t wrinkle
ever. 6 whites, 2 grays, 2 blue and 2 tan . . . some with regular
collars, some with spread collars. At only $3.95 apiece, they
thought it was a very good investment. ' .

Leroy was delighted. He rewarded the boys with all the
answersV‘to the following weck’s quizzes. Two months later,
all the boys from Baskerville Hall had ﬂunked out. Leroy’:
good-looking Van Heusen Century Shirts made him so popular
with the co-eds, that he didn’t have time for quizzes or answers. .

. Not even the size of our great University which hides
the personal lives of its many students can shield the over-
cast of death that strikes close to home.

But how many of us can feel sorry‘for the injured and

_ sick until the’ ultimate pain is felt? Only when one of its

members dies dowe at Pitt forget our petty troubles and
misgivings and mourri the loss of someone else.
pan Fanning, agleader of men _for several years as a mem-
ber of the swimming team, died last Saturdayin Suburban Gen-
eral -Hospital. In New York on the same day his teammates won
a championship.

They, like “many of us, knew that Don was dangerously ill, but
he refused to let them share his grief. His personal troubles re-
m'aine'dI' inside his slim frame——making it difficult for his friends to
extractpity for him from the visible smile shaped on his face.

The few short Imonths that followed his ‘sudden illness in De-
cember were tough for‘ Don: First, he had to give up training and

‘competing with the swimming team and, second, “he was slowed

down to a walk inhis other activities, -YMCA and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity. A “ ' ' I
 ‘his death, however, Coach Ben Grady and the team
regarded him as their leader. The ECSA win “was the one the
boys wanted for ‘Fish’.” The year before his excellent drive in
the backstroke and medley relay events helped Pitt win its first
title in 13 years.

I recall one incident several weeks ago when Don and myself
were relaxing \in the Tuck Shop._ The swimmers‘ had dropped their
third straight dual’-meet and the outlook for the big meet wasn’t
bright. “,‘Fish’,” I asked, “how can they (Pitt) repeat as champs”?

He thought awhile, pulled out a pencil and proceeded to scrib-

~ ble name aftervname of medal winners and point scorers. He handed

me the information‘ and replied, “that’s how we’ll win it and the
boys can’t lose.” Ironically, his teammates __captured the big one

"the day he died. And that sheet of paper revealed the outcome of

the meet almost to the letter. _
But Don ‘had a private-war with me. He was determined to
._fulﬁll Grady’s wishes to make the word FIN extinct. ' “Coach
insists that we’re'tankers or swimmers, not FINS,” he argued.
“Givé him a" break, how about it.” Well, sometimes FIN .is a
better word‘ than tanker, typographically speaking, so Don didn’t

win his case for ﬁn or foe.; '  ~

He- did, "though, suceed in picking up another tag, ‘Fish Finl’.

“If no complications result,”
said Dawson, ~“he will be in a lot
better shape this year. In order to
back up the line again this season,
he’ll have to‘ play either fullback
or. left guard on‘ offense.”

Dawson mentioned this as"on1y

from the new rules outlawing

WSGA, said it will be hard to
change something that has become

that something could be. “Most
students voted against, the pol1_be-

representative, attacked this atti-
_tude. He said “anytime a poll

gress then’ it’s' just ﬁne. But the
minute a poll'does not agreewith

Congress it’s not valid.”

Purdy found agreement on this
pointwith Dan Berger, treasurer

kel said that he still intended to
