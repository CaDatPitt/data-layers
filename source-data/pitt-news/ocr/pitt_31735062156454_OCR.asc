Award today.

The new “man of the year” will
have his name, engraved on ODK

active men on campus. _

the City “that Pitt students park-
ing in the Plaza make parking in-
convenient or impossible for Car,-
negie Institute employees and pa-
trons.” '

No Help To Anyone

Petro contended that City Coun-
cil’s suggestion of placing parking
meters in the Plaza would neither

help Pitt students nor Carnegie-

patrons. He_said that any meters
would serve only to cause discon-
tent since people would constant-
ly be forced to leave whatever
they are doing to put money in the
meters. , ‘
He also said there ‘is adequate
two-hour parking _ between ‘the

protest student parking in the
Plaza.”

Chairman Elected

Congress also found time to elect
chairmen for their several com-
mittees. Many of those elected on
their posts with a unanimous vote.

Sam Granovitz defeated Dan
Purdy and Bud Spangler to gain
the post of Athletic Committee
Representative from Congress.

Lou McCollough and Paul Pe-
tro were elected unanimously to
the positions’ of Appointments
Committee chairman and Assem-
blies Committee Chairman, re-
spectively. Joe Trattner was
unanimously elected chairman of
the Public Relations Committee.‘

Spring Festival authorities
are living under constant ten-
sion and fear. Rumor has it
that the money for the or-
phan’s scholarship, to which
funds from this year’s Festival
will go, may be stolen this
afternoon.

A pony express rider will
arrive at Pitt’s Bigelow Boule-
vard entrance at 3:30 p.m.
with the gold for the scholar-
ship. Students are warned not
to go near this entrance as
there is a chance of gunplay.

The Rodeo show., playing
nightly at the Gardens through
May 9,- has oﬁered its services
to prevent the robbery.’The
Range Rider and his saddle
pal, Dick West, plan to appre-
hend the masked criminal and
restore the gold to its right-
ful guardians; .

According to Festival Chair-

Anyone interested in trying out
should report to the gymnastic

Let Your Hair T
Downe Saturday .

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

Th iannual Old-Timers Game’. on tap for Saturday

afternoon should give most everyone a giant-size VieW of the
latest football team groomed by Red ‘Dawson.

As usual the contest will settle all debates as to which
team runs the slowest, puffs the hardest, ‘and hits ground

most often.

Coach Edgar Jones’ Old,-Timers will out do the varsity in

these statistics to be sure. But
in _a. game of this sort who‘
cares about details which dis‘-
tinguish the champs from the’
chumps ‘
From the point of ‘view ‘of
the keen football fan, by all means
don’t“r_niss this preview of Daw-
son’s power-packed team. On
the other hand, those fellows who
enjoy an occasional chuckle from
a grid affair, cancel that beauty

the Stadium. \ ‘

_ If the 1951 game set a pre-
cedent for the Old-Timers it ‘will
certainly be a “crazy’ day. J ohnny‘
Chickerneo was the coach; Jones,
Lou Cecconi, and Carl ‘De Pasqua
were the stars, "and Luby Di Meolo
asisted everyone with a joke or
two.

JOHN CHICKERNEO

Cecconi, then stationed at Camp Rekett, Va., had played three
quarters of hard football until he was injured. This ‘prompted

Di Meolo to yell, “Don’t Worry
when you get bac .” ’

Bimbo, they’ll discharge you

Or the unique manner in which the Old-Timers picked up sig-
nals. Old reliable Sam Haddad was in on every offensive play
with cards directing his team as the twelfth man on the ﬁeld.

The Old-Timers didn’t stick to the cards all the time, however. ,

Jones was all‘for'scrapping the cards and on several occasions called

the play. “Get out for a pass boys.

9!

But Chickerneo was dead serious about whipping that var-
sity team. He tramped onto the ﬁeld _with clodhoppers and his
- western-styled garment, then directed his out-of-conditioned
athletes through a. hot afternoon,» only to lose, 13-0. Not only
did he concentrate on the players on the ﬁeld but kept the Old-
Timers from drifting off to dreamland between plays while

shaking the dust from their hair.

Fire Damages ~
Sammy House

A burned hallway and a
scorched piano were the results
of a ﬁre in the Sigma Alpha‘Mu
fraternity house at 217 N. Craig
Street, last Saturday about noon.

The ﬁre occurred when a ma-
chine used for steaming wallpa-
per from the walls’ exploded. A
sheet .of ﬂame shot out, burning
the plaster off the hall ceiling, and
partly burning the ﬂoor and pi-
ano.

According to Mel Forst, presi-

dent of SAM, the damage was es-
timated at a little over $100. The
ﬁre was put out quicklyby ﬁre-
men and no one was hurt in the
confusion._ ‘
