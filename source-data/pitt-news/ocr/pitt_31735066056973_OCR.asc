Student’s artw

By Kelly B. Casey
Pbotograpby Editor

A student’s artwork was;

rejected last week for being too
“offensive” to display in a uni-
versity environment in an
upcoming student art show.

Vice Chancellor- of Student
Affairs William Harmon said flat
out “no,” when asked if he
would allow this work to be
exhibited at the Pitt Program
Council—sponsored art show.

“There is no attempt at cen-
sorship, but there is an attempt
at good taste,” Harmon said,
adding that he may reconsider if
the artist can prove to him that
the work has merit.

The work in question was
painted by thircl-year student
David Brown, who entered the
controversial piece" last Tuesday
in the Student Art Exhibit and
Competition: theme, “Open.”

The work, entitled, “There’s
no place like Hollidaysburgj?
depicts a tree in which its
branches are tangled penises

and its trunk is made of testi-j

cles.
On Wednesday, Brown was
told by PPC that his work

would not be accepted after the _

PPC Art Committee, made upof
five students, unanimously rec-
ommended not to hang the
piece. _

Even if the committee had

allowed the piece, Harmon said,
he might have overridden the

‘students’ ‘decision.

“It’s not that I’m trying to pro-

adding that, “I thought and still
think it is inappropriate [in a

The Pittsburgh chapter of the

Pitt not‘ liberal enough
  for Brown’s artwork

By Kelly B. Casey

Photography Editor

When David Brown painted
a piece in high school depict-
ing the execution of Jesus
Christ, he knew that it would
never be accepted in his con-
servative hometown near
Altoona, Pa.

“They would crucify me
back home if I showed some-
thing like this,” he said.

He saidhe thought once he
came to a more liberal envi-
ronment, his taboo—1aden art-
work would finally be accept-
ed.

“Everyone said, David 
once you go to college it’s 10
times more liberal there, it’s 10
times more intellectual there.”

But when he got to Pitt he
said it seemed that what
everyone had told him was
wrong.

Last Wednesday, when
Brown tried to enter his work
in a student art show, once
again it was rejected. And he
said he realized Pitt was no
more willing than his home-
town to accept his work.

His work was turned down
by administration as well as a
ﬁve—student committee, which
said the work might be “offen-
sive” to some.

Brown admitted that part of
his intent is to shock. “I
thought this work would
make controversy when it was
shown.”

After spending 10 months
working on the nine—by—five-
foot painting, he said he was
greatly angered when it was
outright rejected.

Brown said the piece, which
nearly fills the entire left wall
of his tiny Tower C dom1/_stu-
dio, was partly influenced by
Sigmund Freud’s View that
people subconsciously inter-
pret ordinary objects in a sex-
ual manner.

_ The rejected work depicted
a tree, in which the branches
resemble penises and the

« trunk resembles testicles — an

image intended to symbolize
the soul of man.

Brown said he came up
with the idea for the painting
after watching the David

Man arrested for barirzg all

By John Temple

Asst. News Editor

A man possibly responsible
for several indecent exposures
on campus was arrested last
Thursday in Forbes Quad.

Campus Police received a
complaint from a woman who
had been ﬂashed and arriv- ed
at the scene to find the man,
Robert McCabe of the North
Side, leaving the building after
another exposure.

McCabe‘, who yelled obsceni-
ties at police and onlookers,
was arrested for indecent expo-
sure, disorderly conduct and
defiant trespass.

A day earlier, a woman
reported a man with his pants
down on the third floor of
the Cathedral of Learning.
Police unsuccessfully searched
the area.

Police are not sure if McCabe
was the man who exposed
himself in that instance.

Athletes have an option
through Support Services

By Bob Wagner
For The Pitt News

After reading The Pitt News
about a Student Government
Board member‘ concerned
about Support Services for
Student Athletes, Dr. Ron
Brown's first impulse was to get
to the bottom of the problem.

Immediately, Brown, the
director of Support Services,
met with SGB member Brian
Bolton. _ ' ’

“We discussed [Bolton’sl con-
cern,” Brown said.

Bolton said he was worried
about a student athlete that no
longer attended a class that he
was in.

He said he became distressed
about the Support Services, an
academic unit that reports
directly to the Provost and pro-
vides supplemental academic
help for student athletes.

What Bolton did not know
was the reason the student ath-

R If ’I I R Ii M if \ l

lete was not attending the class
any more — he had withdrawn
from it. '

So much for that problem.

“I’m not going to baby-sit
them,” Brown said about Pitt
student athletes. He said he
made certain that the student
knew it was his responsibility
to attend class, do homework
and pay attention to his acade-
mic commitment.

Brown added that the ath-

’ letes have responsibilities like

the rest of the Pitt students.

However, that does not mean
that the Support Services will
do the athlete’s school work.

“Tutors are to supplement
instruction that a student gets in
the classroom,” Brown said.
“No tutor would be doing
homework.”

Brown said that if a student
athlete comes to a tutoring ses-
sion and isnot prepared, the
tutor is instructed not to work

Winter Games at Hidden
Valley. The concluding
event, the awards ceremony,

was held in the evening.

This year’s Special
Olympics were a success,
according to Yourish.

“The athletes had a tremen-
dous time, and that is what’s
important,” he said. “This
country needs to be more
helpful of each other, and
the Pitt Greeks found out
how satisfying it can be to
help someone else.”

Greek Week participants
have been active in several
other joint efforts with the
athletes in the past two
months, including a handball
tourney at Trees Hall, “A Day
for the Athletes” at the
Pittsburgh Sports Garden and
the KBL Sports Auction. A

"“The Winter Games were
really the culmination of
everything that Special
Olympics is about,” Donofe
said. “It was a huge event
and touched many people.
Special Olympics is a first-
class organization,‘ and we
were proud to be a part of
it.”

The Olympic events fin-
ished by noon and Pitt stu-
dents were able to mingle
with the athletes and ski for
free in the afternoon.

“Melissa and the Pitt
Greeks should be commend-
ed on their contribution to
the Special Olympics’ success
this year,” Yourish said. “The
volunteer work they did was
really appreciated.”

Demonstrators argue over the pros and cons of the Mt. Graham telescope project during
yesterday's rally held on the William Pitt Union patio.

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

Activists opposing Pitt’s
involvement with the Mt.
Graham Telescope Project
said that an “exchange of

information” with Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor was missing one
ingredient —- information.
“We really didn’t get any
information _ from
lO’Connorl,” Dr. Robert

Witzeman, head of the
Maricopa Audubon Society
said after yesterday’s meet-
ing. “He was just putting in
time without giving us the
benefit of what’s on his
mind.”

The two parties met in the
Cathedral of Learning for
nearly an hour.

“The individuals who are
concerned about the place-
ment of a University of
Arizona telescope brought

ont Chancellor O'Connor
I

forth their concerns,” said
O’Connor, who will make the
final decision concerning
Pitt’s involvement with the
telescope project.

The opposition to develop-
ment of Mt. Graham arose
because of belief in the
sacred nature of the moun-
tain to the San Carlos
Apache. Environmental
activists also claim the moun-
tain’s ecology is unique and
irreplaceable. .

C0"ti"“edf"0mP“ge I “If the artist brings it back
to us in a ready-to-hang posi-
tion [that would solve the first
problem],” Misuraca said.

Brown said that he was
never told that if he framed
the nine-foot-by—five—foot can-
vas that the committee may
reconsider accepting the
work.

Brown said that after meet-
ing with the committee direc-
tor, he believes the committee
made the decision on content
and not because of the prob-
lems of how and where to
hang it.

“I’ve been working on this
for 10 months, for five hours
a night. If it was only the
frame, I would have been
more than happy to go out
within the hour. I could have
had it turned in with the
frame all set to go,” Brown
said.

The second problem with
hanging the work is the visual
accessibility of the art gallery,
Misuraca said.

Misuraca expressed concern
for people passing by the
window who would be be
subjected to the work, which

an attempt to stifle any cre-
ativity or anything. Although,
I am sure it will be interpreted
as lcensorshipl.”

The PPC Art Committee
Director Mary Grace Scaffidi
said that the committee’s main
problem with hanging the
work, which some people
may find “offensive,” was that
it could be seen clearly
through the large Conney M.
Kimbo Gallery win-glow.

“Anybody who has no
desire to see the artwork
could look in and see it,” she
said.

Scaffidi said that the com-
mittee would reconsider
hanging the piece if it could
figure out a way to hide it
from those who may be
offended by it. She added that
the. artist would also have to
re—enter the piece with a
frame.

According to Assistant
Director of Student Activities
Tom Misuraca, if those three
problems concerning the
work can be resolved, the
committee would reconsider
its denial.

f‘It’s not that tutor’s job to
replace the classroom instruc-
tion,” he said. “It’s to supple-
ment it.”

Some student athletes choose
not to use the Support Services,
and Brown said he does not
see a problem with that.

“Our program is voluntary,”
Brown stated. “We do not place
requirements on students.”

\Vhen Brown came to Pitt in
early 1991, he said he saw a
decent program that had poten-
tial for greatness.

“I looked at what the stu-
dents needed, listened to their
requests and looked at the
areas I felt we needed to be
doing,” he said.

Not only does Brown want to
enhance the athlete’s academic
experience, he said he also
hopes the athlete will leave the
university with a diploma.

“My job is to take the univer-

penises with its mouth open,

“When Mapplethorp was at
the Cincinatti Museum of Art,”
Misuraca said, “you couldn’t
just walk by and see
Mapplethorp.”

Brown said he had no
problem with PPC concealing
the work from passers—by.

Lastly, PPC would have to
post a warning outsidethe
gallery, stating that the show
contained potentially offen-
sive material.

Misuraca said that it was not

Founded in 1976, Support
Services has moved from the
William Pitt Union to its present
location, which is the fifth floor
of Pitt Stadium. It is there that
the athletes can meet with
tutors, use the computer/leam-
ing lab there or go study for a
test.

With all the resources present
right in front of the student-ath-
lete, Brown said he makes sure
that the athlete knows he must
perform well in both academics
and athletics, especially in the
world today.

“A student athlete has to
understand that both go togeth-
er,” Brown said. “You can’t do
one with out the other. It’s a
tough standard, but it’s been
done before.”

Brown knows, because he
played Division I basketball for
Oklahoma City University and
graduated in four years. He was
expected to go to school, make
the grade and do well athleti-
Cally.

Years later, Brown is making
sure that today’s generation
knows where it is heading after
Pitt.

Possible censorship  

When David Brown, a junior majoring in art history at Pitt, fin-
ished a painting he had been working on for four months, he
hoped he would be able to display it at the Pitt Program
Council’s annual student art exhibit. The theme is an “open” one,
and after submitting it for approval he was turned away because

of the painting’s “offensive” and perverse nature.

The painting is a Freudian analysis. Images of bodily ﬂuid and
male genitalia envelope the entire canvas. But even to the most
novice of eyes, there can be seen a clear sense of artistic worth.

The work was rejected by an art committee made up of five
student members. The committee was applauded byseveral stu-
dent advisers, such as Tom Misuraca of PPC and Dr. William
Harmon, vice chancellor of Student Affairs. But even if the stu-
dents were to reconsider the artwork and accept it, Harmon said

he would fight it.

Harmon says it’s not censorship, only “good sense” — invent-
ing a new politically correct phrase for censorship. Whatever you
call it, Harmon’s “good sense” keeps the painting out of the con-

test for little reason and limits «public choice.

The University of Pittsburgh must be careful not to assume the
role of Big Brother. If it keeps the painting out of the exhibit, the
committee is infringing on that individual’s right to express him-

self.

Secondly, by choosing what the public should or should not
see, it will have denied the most fundamental right we have as
United States Citizens — individual choice. Individuals should be
able to choose what" they do and do not want to see. The univer-
sity shouldn’t choose for them. A disclaimer and a partition in
front of the painting is one thing. Outright censorship is another.

art showing up are hardly low. To avoid something like this from
happening in the future, the student art committee should either
set strict guidelines dictating to students the type of work they
can and cannot submit, or they shouldn’t haven’t an exhibit at
all. At the least, issues like censorship and freedom of expression

won’t come up. At the most, individual choice will be main-
tained.

great idea. However, this is a much
more insidious form of racism than
those with the dangerous names
such as the whitesupremacists or
the Black Panthers. This is a form
of racism working under the guise
of “doing good” for one’s ethnic
heritage.

on the proposal. Two of the
three members absent from
the meeting, President Jacob
Brody and Tara Munkatchy,
are attending .a conference in
Texas.

Raleigh Thompson, describ-
ing himself as a full—blooded
Apache, explained why the
site was sacred to the Apache
people.

“You have your grassroots.
The 11.5‘. flag, it is your
sacred, it makes you happy.

“Mt Graham is our sacred.
The people at Arizona know
it," he said.

Thompson spoke on the

customs and rites practiced
by his people in the group of
mountains around and includ-
ing Graham.

Roger Featherstone, from
the National Friends of Mt
Graham Coalition, also asked
for SGB support.

He said that in 1985, when
environmentalists first became
active with opposition, they
did not know the sacredness
of the site to the San Carlos
Apache tribe.

Featherstone described the
ecosystem of the mountain
and said that the heart of the
proposed site is in 615 acres
of untouched forest.

He added that the endan-

been getting all the press,” is
a main concern of the envi-
ronmentalists.

“There are two critters that
are thought of when you
think of endangered species
— the spotted owl and the
Mt. Graham red squirrel," he
said. _

As for the Apache tribe, he
added, “\Y/hen people think

two or three sacred sites in

Knauer encouraged the
board to pursue Pitt adminis-
tration.

He said the fact that it took
the activists a year to set up a
meeting with the chancellor
added to the fact that Pitt
astrologers have been unwill-
ing to meet with his group,
leads him to say that Pitt is
hiding something.

“Try to break through this
wall that the university has
put up, because students
should know what the univer-
sity is doing — especially
when it involves $15 million
for an initial investment,” he
said.

Foner said that the Board

said SGB also tried to bring-a

Hurricanes cool off
Pitt Women's hoops

By Neil Chaudhuri

Staﬂ" Writer

The once—again' hot Pitt women’s
basketball team rode into its final
game of the regular season last
night on the wave of a hardearned
two-game winning streak.

The opposing Miami Hunicanes
took care of that as they handed
the visiting Panthers a 77-65 loss.

It was a game of potent offense,
as both teams managed to put a lot
of points on the scoreboard After
Pitt gained an early 5-4 edge, the
‘Canes started to pour it on. Guard
Della Wilson, whom the Panthers
held in check during the first meet-
ing between these two teams, led
the way for Miami. Her running
jump shot gave Pitt fits all evening
and helped Miami to gain a 10-
point lead midway through the
half. - l .-

not enough to fend off the offen-

took a 54-26 lead into the locker

The second half was more of the
same for the Panthers. The key
‘Canes in the second half were for-
ward Carla Ham's and guard Holly
Rillinger, both of whom the
Panthers had held at bay when the
tcxlms fust met. Ham's went wild at
Miami’s offensive end and finished
the game with an impressive 20
points to lead Miami.

Rillinger, Miami’s first-year phe-
nom, racked up 12 points.
Plowden and Wilson finished in
double figures as well, a feat
accomplished by four of Miami’s
starting five. The magnificent distri-
bution of offense kept Pitt off bz -

As the men’s 2()()—yard but-
terfly ended last Sunday night
and the points were updated,
for the first time in 11 years a
team other than Pitt was atop
the leader board.

The Panthers looked up
and knew,_ barring a disquali-
fication of the Wildcats in the
last relay, that the “streak"
was over.

Knoles said coming into the
meet that Villanova was not
going to concede Pitt's 11th
straight title.

“I knew it was going to be
tough, re.al tough, and I knew
that Villanova had an edge
coming into the meet,“
Knoles said. “There was a
possibility of them giving its
a run for the money, and

they sure did that.“

Sophomore Matt Brady said
that he is not sure what hap-
pened.

“Were trying to figure out
what went wrong,” Brady
said. “Villanova’s momentum
started at the beginning and
Saturday we realized
were in trouble.”

"If we don’t have people
grow upvand mature, we
could lose this meet,” Brady
had said. “We’re a little
relaxed, and the younger
guys aren’t aware of the seri-
ousness of the situation."

After the meet on Sunday,
Knoles agreed that Saturday
was the turning point of the
meet.

“We should have been
more awake on Saturday.
That was a coaching error on
my part,” Knoles said.

“It is unfortunate that. at
some point, the streak had to

Knoles said it may have
been tougher to take for his
three senior tri-captains. Jim
Austin, Don Boyd and Kevin
McLaughlin.

“I think the seniors were a
little more devastated than
everyone else because
they've never known any-
thing else but winning a Big

said.

McLaughlin said that he
was upset leaving Pitt with-
out a fourth title.

Lacrosse scorches Delaware

Valley 19-4 in season opener

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team
opened up its 1993 season in
much the same fashion as it
closed the last one, which is
good -—— except from the com-
petition’s point of view.

The Panthers (1-0, 1-0
league), powered by their
usual high-scoring offense,
exploded for three goals in the

game’s first minute to steamroll

Delaware Valley College, 19-4,
at the Cost Center’ last Saturday.

For the Panthers, the win
was their first in the newly
formed‘ National Collegiate
Lacrosse League (NCLL), a
league consisting of collegiate
lacrosse clubs in the nation’s
eastern and mid-western sec-
tions. Last season, Pitt complet-
ed its most successful season to
date in its old league, claiming

its third straight Allegheny.

Lacrosse League championship
and a dramatic overtime win in
the championship game of its
own Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Shootout.

“I didn’t know anything
about Delaware Valley before
this game,” head coach Gary
Neft said. “But we are 1-0 and
have our first league victory.”

It was obvious from the start
of this game that again Pitt was
up against an opponent that

 

was quite inferior. Just 20 sec-
onds into the game’s opening
period, Ed Croot directed his
shot to the back of the
Delaware Valley net, giving the
Panther’s their first score of the
season and a quick 1-0 lead. In
less than a minute, behind
goals by Scott Gordon and
Croot, Pitt had increased their
lead threefold and the rout was
on.

Already holding a 3-1 advan-
tage, the Panthers’ Croot com-
pleted his first period hat trick
with a goal off of a pass from
defenseman Luke Fox at 5:40.
Later in the first, Pitt was on
the power play and the
Panthers’ Eric Kaveny wasted
no time in putting what would
turn out to be the game winner
behind Delaware Valley's goal-
tender, giving the home team a
5-1 lead. Craig Leslie netted his
first goal just five minutes later
to cap the scoring for the
Panthers during the first.

Already in control,vthe Pitt
offense went for the jugular
during the second. Leslie took
the first cut with his second at
the 45-second mark of the new
period, and Chad Lehman
added two more for the
Panthers, who, after only 17
minutes of play, held a decided
9-1 advantage.

No date set for Lemieux ’s return
Penguins’ star could return tonight

By Jim Clark
Staff ‘Writer

Even though his radiation treatments are
to end tomorrow, Penguin officials said
they do not know when Mario Lemieux
will return to the
Penguin lineup.

‘‘We’re not
.sure,” Steve
Bovino, assistant
director of media
relations for the
Penguins said
Monday. “A deci-

 

sion hasn’t been reached yet.”

Bovi_no said that Lemieux is more likely
to return for a home game.
The next one for the Penguins is March

V 9 against Boston. The Penguins play twice

before then, including tonight in
Philadelphia. If all is well after the final
treatment, he could return to the lineup
as early as tonight.

Lemieux has been sidelined with
Hodgkin's disease, a mild form of cancer,
since mid-January. According to Harry
Sanders, director of media relations for
the Penguins, Lemieux’s radiation treat-
ment has gone well.

Sanders said that he expects Lemieux to
play regularly once he returns.

“lHe’lll pretty much take a regular shift,”
Sanders said. “It depends how he feels.”

There were rumors Lemieux would
return last week, but Sanders dispelled
those rumors.

He said that while the radiation is going

on, there is a danger to Lemieux return-
ing. V

“The danger is if he got a cut in the
area [that’s being treated],” Sanders said.
“They’d have to stop the treatment until it
was healed.”

Bovino said that he wasn’t sure if
Lemieux would need future treatments.

“I think they’ll determine that after the
originalones are over,” he said.

Bovino said that a medical spokesper-
son for Lemieux would not be available
for comment at the current time.

‘‘I doubt they’ll have anything to say
until after he comes back,” Bovino said.

Lemieux was the NHL’s leading scorer
with 104 points at the time he went out of
the lineup in January.

Buffalo’s Pat LaFontaine passed Lemieux
up in the scoring race last week. Lemieux

was in hot pursuit of Wayne Gretzky’s

single-season scoring record of 215
points. 0

Lemieux’s back, the original cause for
his checking out of the lineup in January,
is much better, according to Sanders.

“His back has had two months to heal,”
Sanders said. “It’s pretty much 100 per-
cent.” -

Lemieux has had a long list of health
problems, most notably his back, during
his career in Pittsburgh. Lemieux has
missed over 80 games since 1990 with
back problems. '

Without Lemieux in the lineup this year,
the Penguins are 11-10-2. Their record is
28-9-4 record with their superstar in the
hneup.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 2, 1993

Big East

Continued from page 7

With the dedication of the
Pitt coaches to set higher
swimming and diving stan-
dards and their petitioning
the rest of the league to
catch up —— as well as the
other schools answering the
call to raise the level — the
last three years has seen the
Big East become a competi-
tive league and not just a
one—horse race.

This past weekend served
as an obvious indication as
the Pittvmen relinquished

. their 10-year reign as confer-

ence champs, while the
women took third place for
the second consecutive year
after they had ruled for nine
years previous.

Belowich acknowledged

that, especially in light
of Villanova’s five
Trees Pool records at

Sunday's meet, that the lev-
els have definitely been
raised’.

“You are seeing, top to

Belowich said. “Every coach

thing.”

sport throughout the years.

But blowout after blowout
has taken its toll on the ath-
letes and the coach.

“There were years that we
won so handily, it was
almost embarrassing,”
Belowich said. “I had to do
mental tricks to motivate the
girls.”

With a larger talent “pool”
in the Big East, the
increased competition has
brought out a part of com-
peting that may sometimes
be overlooked in sports.

“It is the upsets. It is the
competitiveness. It’s looking
up at the scoreboard all the
time and wondering
That’s the exciting part,”
Belowich said. “Part of the
deal, the excitement, the
marvelous feeling you
get when a session is over,
is that unknown.

"If it was so predictable
who was going to win, why
bother?”

Looking back on this past
weekend’s meet, neither
Knoles nor Belowich regret
their successful work at
making the Big East a
nationally competitive con-
ference.

“I would say that our con-
ference now is probably
among the top five or six
in the country,” Belowich
said.

M Swim

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, March 2, 1993
 

Continued from page 7

Sophomore Jonti Bacharach
said that the team has grown
accustomed to winning the
conference meet.

“After the first day of swim-
ming [Friday] we had the lead
and we didn’t go as hard as
we could in prelims on
Saturday,” Bacharach said.

But despite Villanova’s 14.5
point win over the second-
place Panthers, Pitt head
coach Chuck Knoles said that
he was happy with his team’s
performance. After all, l’itt
did lose over 500 points to
graduation last year.

“I think having such a
young team and going
through something as emo-
tional as a Big East champi-
onship gives them a chance
to step back,” Knoles said.
“By not winning they can
grow up a little bit and refo—
cus on where they want to
go next year.”

“I thought the guys did a
hell of a job,” Knoles said.
“I’m pretty up right now, I’m
not depressed or anything.”

The Panthers have also
been without the services of
junior David Dodson all sea-
son. A healthy Don Boyd in
the breaststroke events would
have definitely made an
impact for Pitt. Boyd had
been sidelined until a little
over a month ago with

mononucleosis.

“It was a tragic 100 breast-
stroke, and you can’t do any-
thing about it,” Knoles said.
“We had all the bad rolls go
against us and all the good
rolls went towards
Villanova.”

Bacharach said that the loss
was tough to take.

“Nobody likes to lose,
especially the streak,"
Bacharach said. “We're such
a young team, and this team
will bounce back.”

Knoles said that the team’s
recruiting year has gone well
and that his returnees will be
ready next year.

“They were all very posi-
tive in looking towards next
year and determined in their
resolves to correct any errors
they made this year,” Knoles
said. “They are refocusing on
trying to bring the [champi-
onship] cup, back to
Pittsburgh.

“Sometimes you fall short
of your goals, but you realize
you have to get up the very
next day and the sun still
comes up.”

SPLISHES AND SPLASHES:
Pitt’s divers will be compet-
ing in the NCAA Pre-qual
Meet March 12 and 13 at

Continued from page 7
vexed, left for some other
potent Big East sqttad.

Or two —— and the more
logical of the two thought
processes —- that the erratic,
skill-deprived conference
battle of attrition was just
another traditional f1ash—in-
the-Pitt basketball-pan — a
mirage of hustle and heart
that temporarily augments
the bricklaying reality that is
a first-round loss in the Big
East tourney and a ,slap-in-
the-face NIT bid.

While most localites may
tend to agree with the grim
reality of the latter forecast,
the men in blue and gold
prefer to force the former
conclusion — that Pitt will
persevere and pound its
way to the Big Dance later
this month.

For point guard Jerry
McCullough, who called the

Prov_idence loss of a week‘

ago the lowest point of the
season, the Hoya squeaker
is the remedy for an ailing
Pitt squad that had lost six
of eight.

“This puts us right back
on track,” McCullough said.
“We needed this to show we
can win. Everybody always
says Pitt fades at the end
and this takes tis one step
up.”

A key cog in ending Pitt’s
winless clog has been the
re—emergence of Orlando
Antiqua. The New York City
sophomore hasn’t pulled a
recurring Houdini act 51 la
Chris McNeal — dominant
one game, MIA the next —
he’s just been patient wait-
ing for his opportunity to
contribute on the court,
conspiring and inspiring
from the bench.‘ For the
supersub-turned-solid
starter, Sunday’s triumph
wasn’t ‘a matter of beauty —
it was a matter of survival.

“We needed that win to
get us back on track,”
Antiqua said. “It was an
ugly game, but we have to
use it to our advantage —
keep using it to motivate us
to play hard against
Villanova, because we’re
going to need to win our
remaining games.

“We’ve got to get these
next two games.”

A critical key for Pitt’s
continued success is, of
course, the aforementioned-
but-oft—affable McNeal, who
has been more on and off
than a talk show applause
sign this season. “Big
Daddy” churned to the tune
of 11 points and 12 boards
in the Georgetown game,
semi—impressing eternal cur-

,know

mudgeon/head coach Patti
Evans.

“He did a good job off the
boards and a good job
defensively,” Evans said.
“Three for 11 is not the best
from a couple feet away’,
but it’s a start. He’s back
on.”

While Evans showed ce’r-
tainty in his opinion of the
uncertain McNeal, he was
less’ secure in revealing his
plans for tonight’s starting
lineup —— specifically at
shooting guard.

“I don’t know,” Evans
said. “Orlando did a very
good job for us [Sunday],
especially in the first half.
He gave us some good
offense — some spark —
and rebounded very well.

“There are times we can
use Brock——- especially
against zones. But I _don’t
if we can use him
against man—to-man. We’ll
see.”

PITT NOTES: In their first
meeting‘ of the year,
Villanova upset Pitt, 82-76,
behind Lance Miller’s 27
points — 20 coming in the
second half. James Bryson
added 20 for the Wildcats
(8-16, 3-13 in the Big East),
who head into tonight’s
contest at the bottom of the
conference standings.

was showing no mercy, was ,
not through. Before the
period was over, goals by
Leslie, Dave Walter (two),
Josh Gochnauer (two) and
Chris Rice would allow the
Panthers to sit back at the
half on a rather comfortable
15-2 cushion.

The Panthers’ always
tenacious defense held
Delaware Valley’s offense
away from their net for most
of the first half, and Mike
Shiner held down Pitt’s last
line of defense with a strong
performance in goal.

Just 30 seconds into the
third, Gochnauer quickly
added to Pitt’s lead with his
third goal of the game off of
-a pass received from Lee
Stember. The Panthers then
slowed the pace of the
game down considerably.
Still, Delaware Valley was
not able to take advantage
of the slower pace and
could not put the ball past
back—up goaltender and
defenseman John Foris, who
relieved the Shiner, at the
half.

Brett Mullighan tallied his
first point of the season at
the period’s 14:00 mark

and Pitt continued to roll,

up 17-2 with one quarter to
go.

Gordon and Brian Barrett
netted Pitt’s final two goals
as 14 Panther players scored
points in their first effort of
the season. The Panthers’
offense, which is always
dangerous in even—strength
situations, was deadly on
the power play, going two
for three with the man
advantage. Gochnauer led
the Pitt attack in scoring
with three goals and three
assists.

“I am happy that every-
body got playing time,” Neft
said. “This is the first time I
had seen some ofthese
guyson a full field so I am
very pleased. Our strength
is our team depth. We can
go 20 strong and not get
hurt anywhere.”

Pitt’s next game is sched-
uled for Thursday, March 4,
when the Panthers will take
on Washington & Jefferson
at 8 p.m. at the Cost Center.

“They are a decent team
but we are better," Neft
said. “But if we play like we
did at times during this
game, we could be in trou-
ble.”
