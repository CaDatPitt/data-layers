Shepard wins Student Government presidency

By Jenifer Crook
A and Kathie Roth
Staff Writers

The fact that Julie Shepard hasn’t had a single moment

free from campaigning to vacuum her room in the past
three weeks paid off last night, when it was announced
that the Pitt senior had swept up 1220 votes to capture the
1990 ‘SGB presidency. _
‘§“‘.;.-“‘Last year was one thing, but this means so much
igore,” said Shepard, referring to her one—vote win over
Harper Watters last year to receive the most votes of all
board candidates. “I am just so excited. There’s been so
many things I’ve been hoping to be able to plan for so
long, and now, God-willing and Board-willing, they’ll
work out. .

“The whole day I have been so excited, not nervous,”
she added. .“I had no idea how the votes were going.”

Shepard’s opponent, Kurt Stark, collected 955 votes. “I_
appreciate the people who supported me during the
campaign and afterwards,” said Stark, refusing further
comment.

In the race for Student Government Board positions,
Jay Gervasoni claimed the highest tally with 1002 votes.
He was closely followed by Bob Batchelor, who received
979 votes. Katie Malaspina finished third with a total of
976. The three will hold seats on the Senate Council as
well as their board positions.

5 .  other newly—e1ected board members are Patrick
G K , ramowich (886 votes), Michael Golden (862), Michael
ﬁhen (848), Brian Felgoise (714), and Don “Dusty”
Rhodes (695).
Responding to his first place finish, Gervasoni said,

“I'm shocked to be completely honest. I never expected

this; I just wanted to get on the board."

Gervasoni said that his top priority after takingoffice in
January will be to “try and get a South Oakland shuttle
operating as soon as possible.” . ,

Batchelor, who was slated with Shepard on the ballot,
said, “I didn’t expect to place as high as I did, though ‘I
expected to place in the top eight.‘ iI’m elated to be

I second. My platform dealt with education; I intend to

jump right into that.”

Saying that her long campaigning hours made the
difference, Malaspina also expressed surprise over her
high placing. “I'm very" glad of the outcome. I hadn't

V expected to do as well as I did.”

Cohen said, “It's time we put the election behind us and
pay attention to the new job we have starting in January
to improve the university.”

“It was really difficult campaigning as an independent,”

said Abramowich, adding that the first thing he will do is .

“relax for a few days” before getting back_ to work on the
SGB’s Governmental Relations Committee.
Despite the alleged difficulty independents have had in

winning SGB seats, this year the number of elected non- .

Greeks increased, with four earning board positions
compared to last year’s two.

The four candidates not elected-were Elan Salee (643),
Andrew Lentvorski (S66), Theresa Wilson (460), andjohn

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, November 9, 1989

Book recounts child abuses

By Tammy Richardson

‘ For The Pitt News

John has been told that he tried
to drink ammonia when he was
four years old.

“I know now that was my first
attempt at suicide,” said John, a
48-year-old survivor of incest.

John is one of nine male victims
of incest interviewed by Mike
Lew in his new book, Victims No
Longer. According to Lew, a
psychotherapist specializing in
sexual child abuse, John is not
alone in his long fight to recover
from incest.

Lew, who hosted a training
seminar at Pitt last Friday, stressed
the difficulties that male victims
often face. Lew intended the
seminar to aid counseling and
social service professionals in the
treatment of adult male incest
victims. The American culture,
said Lew, does not allow for men
to be victims. H

“A ‘real’ man is expected to
protect himself in any situation,”
he pointed out.

However, Lew noted that those

‘old attitudes are changing, and

he now encounters many men in
his practice who are revealing
their incestuous childhood

Pitt prof
lauded

a for poison

research

By Shelenia Rauscher
Staff Writer

A Pitt psychology professor will I

receive a $50,000 award in
appreciation of his research
involving children who .were
exposed to lead poisoning.
Herbert L. Needleman, M.D.,
, professor of psychiatry at Pitt’s
school of medicine, will be
presented the Charles A. Dana
award for Pioneering

Achievement in Health in a.

ceremonyeat the Plaza Hotel in
New York City tonight.

The award winners were
chosen from 100 nominations by

nine “people who seemed to '

constitute a well-balanced

’ committee,” according to Margo
Viscusi, director of the Dana"

Awards program. The board,

' which consists of people who are

prominent in their fields, includes

_ v the president of Brown University,

If)‘-

:3)

the secretary of the Smithsonian
Institute and the president of the
Association of American Colleges,
among others.

Dr. Needleman has been

“studying children with lead in '

their [bodies] .and measuring the

effects on their intelligence and '

school behavior," he said. His
work demonstrates‘ that even
small doses of lead can cause
some type of, lower mental
development. His research has
helped to persuade government
agencies to lower the lead content

of gasoline and paint. Also, he
See Poison, page 4

experiences for the first time.
Incest, as defined by Lew, is a
“violation of trust between a
parent and child by sexualizing
their relationship.” Lew went on
to dispel the notion that victims

can “bring the abuse on
themselves.”
He said that a young child will

never willingly seek sexual
attention from an adult, and that}
“sex between an adult and child
is impossible without coercion."
Lew also added that part of the
problem may be the conception
by adults of children as property.

As adults, Lew stated that male
incest victims frequently have
severe difﬁculties in life, including
suicidal tendencies and the
inability to sustain a love
relationship. ' 6

Robert, another incest survivor
who was abused by his mother as
a child, said in Lew’s book, “My
romance relationships have been
difficult from the beginning. The
moment I start feeling attraction
for a female companion, I_ get
nauseous.

“I have vomited my way
through every relationship I have
ever had.”

For Robert and many other
victims, Lew defines recovery as

“the ability to make life decisions
without feeling the effects of past
abuse." According to Lew,
recovery is possible, but he added
that it is a “slow, difficult process
which can begin only when [the
individual] is ready to work hard
for it.” '

Lew said he often endorses the
use of group therapy for his
patients, and he recommends
“mixed groups,” which contain
both male and female victims.

In addition to maintaining a
private practice, Lew also leads
several therapy groups, and is
the co-director of the Next Step
Counseling and Training Center
in Newton, Mass.

Lew recommended that
anyone desiring further
information or personal help in
this field can contact either the
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape
or the Center for Victims of Violent
Crime. He closed the training
session by reinforcing the idea
that the work counselors and
therapists are doing in the field of
male incest victims is “real and
important” and urged them not
to give up.

Speaking to the therapists, he
said, “Make no mistake, you are
changing the world."

Arts, crafts featured  
at '89 Black Bazaar

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

The Black Action Society continued to celebrate their annual
Black Week yesterday with a “black bazaar" in the Forbes Quad
Galleria. v

The bazaar featured arts and crafts from all over the world.
Over 30 vendors were on hand to sell their merchandise.

Dorothy Pass, a representative from “Out of Africa” in
Oakland, was offering many pieces of jewelry, handbags and
even calendars. “All of our articles are hand-made in Africa,”
she said.

She displayed many bracelets, made of both lizard and
snakeskin, along with bronze. Many of the items, which were

_ made in Western Africa, were made from the skins of various
reptiles. One particularly large handbag was made entirely of
python skin. Pass said, however, that none of the skins came

— from animals on the endangered species list.

Many of the articles were colored in green, red and brown.
The bracelets showed off an array of bright colors such as
green, orange, gold and bronze. _ I

Pass also offered hand-woven garments, such as some native
headgear worn in Nigeria. She displayed both hand-woven and

. Usually, he's rnild-mannered
New Yorker David Myers. But
when the electron pathways
beckon, he dons his headset with
the spacy—looking spectacles and
his wondrous strap-on box and
becomes Arcane Device,
champion of experimental music
and creator of some mighty
unusual sounds. Arcane Device
will be bringing those sounds to
the Turmoil Room Gallery in

Wilkinsburg for a live concert on
Nov. 11.

Myers dates his humble origins
back to 1981, when he heard a
radio program about electronic
music which piqued his interest.
He grew up with the experimental
rock of the ’70s, but then became
inspired to fashion his own music
from an artist’s point of view.
“I’ve been painting for a long
time, so I approach music in the
same way. I feel like I’m creating
new colors and textures with the
electronic instruments.”

While his earlier work was
obviously more melodic, Myers
began experimenting with wilder
sounds, which led to his current
style of performance called
“improvisations for feedback. ” All
the sonic ammunition Myers
needs is contained in a portable
case that he designed and built
l1irnself. A typical performance

consists of his manipulation of '

the knobs and switches on the

device, which produces tones as.
ethereal as the outer reaches of?

Carnegie hosts Ross Bleckner exhibition

By Heather N eisworth
Staff Writer

Dark, unsettling images are
presented to focus upon and
ponder.

These haunting works have
been created by Ross Bleckner,
and are currently being presented
at The Carnegie Museum in
Bleckner’s first museum survey
which depicts various stages of
his career.

Bleckner’s work is based in
part upon the op-art movement
which began in the early 1960s. It
is in op art that he believes. an
artist can show a scientiﬁc and
impersonal abstract work that
speaks symbolically of the
shortcomings of modern society.
This belief is reinforced in the
two categories of Bleckner’s work:
image and stripe paintings.

The image paintings usually
incorporate recognizable objects,
but place them in an unfamiliar
setting. This technique produce
a personal theme. ‘

Many death themes are
prevalent, and in 1984, Bleckner
also began a series of paintings
dealing with AIDS.

“Memoriam,” a work from 1985,
shows a metal urn that looks as if
a spirit is captured inside it. Pastel
yellow, green and pink ' ﬂowers
are placed in the corner,

 

producing a startling contrast to " it

the stark blackness. At first glance,
the painting seems depressive
and pessimistic, but closer
inspection gives mortality an
uplifting sense. Despair is
combined with hope.

Bleckner, who is now 40, has
been described as the “ painter of
the ‘80s. ” Younger artists consider
him to be one of today’s most
contemporary artists, and his
work reflects the turbulent era of
the ‘80s and the public’s concern
with such issues as nuclear
warfare and AIDS.

In contrast, the painting “Cage"
remains truer to the basic style of
op art with its basic line scheme
of bright shades of green and
yellow. it looks bright and happy
with its outward display of light
throughout.

This is where the paradox lies.
The viewer receives a pleasant
sensation which is swiftly taken
away upon viewing the still-
entrapped birds that remain.
Bleckner seems to be retelling
the age-old notion of “things are
not always what they seem.”

The ‘90s are frightfully upon
us, and with the close of the ‘80s,
new problems will arise for
humanity to face. It remains
important that we do not forget
the past. This exhibition may be
forgotten, but its message will
linger on in memory.

Just like a speed freak ready to
crash after a 72—hour binge,
Soundgarden can oscillate from
dense and languid to brash and
spastic in the blink of a bloodshot
eye. The boys can be amiable
and calm one minute and in the
next minute explode in a musical
fury. (Take, for example, the hole
in NYU’s Loeb Auditorium wall,
which vocalist Chris Cornell so
artfully placed with a few thrusts
of the mike stand. Fans loved it,
but the New York police were
not as impressed).

And, speaking of brash, you
can stuff the Zeppelin

comparisons, because. even
though it was a great band,
Soundgarden is a bit more
musically innovative than to
simply rip—off '70s riffs. Besides,
you can't find any references to
Gollum, dragons or mystical
maidens anywhere in its lyrics.
“In the studio we'll write songs
not from any one direction,” says
Cornell. “We do a lot of
experimenting. There isn’t just
one songwriter in the band, each
member has a different input.
That helps the diversity a lot.”

Soundgarden had its genesis in
1984, when Hiro Yamamoto
(bass) and Kim T hayil (guitar)
joined Cornell, who at the time

Soundgarden: ultrameg

was drumming and singing.

By 1986, Soundgarden had
acquired drummer Matt Cameron
and soon after released a series
of singles and 12—inches, as well
as its first EP, Screaming forlzfe,
on the infamous SubPop label,
also based in Seattle.

Seattle has recently become
known as a mecca for
underground rock (thanks mainly
to SubPop) and is home to the
likes of great grunge rockers
Mudhoney and Nirvana, to name
a few. Cornell credits a non
success—oriented attitude for the
music that radiates from the scene
there.

says Cornell. ‘‘It’s not striving to

“All Seattle bands get along,”

make millions and it's not like a
member of Motley Crue punching
out a guy from Guns ‘N Roses.
Nobody’s doing it for any other
reason than to make cool music
and that’s what makes the Seattle
underground scene so great!"
In 1988, Soundgarden made a
move to SST and released its first
full—length LP Ultramega OK. It
captured the true essence of the
band, combining heavy, ripping,
hard rock with just enough pure,
punk-rock energy. Comell’s wide-
range vocals, along with a
thudding bass and rhythmic
guitar, began to attract more and

. more attention.

Soon major labels came calling,
and 1989’s Louder Than Love was

a result of signing with A&M.
Cornell says the deal came after
“several years of talking —with
A&M. They’ve been talking with
us since the beginning, even
before SubPop and SST. They
were making offers, but we
wanted to wait ‘til we built
ourselves up to that level."

So far, Soundgarden has been
pleased with the treatment it has
received from a major label.“
“We’re getting the best of both
worlds,” Cornell says. “A&M’s
given us a lot of input. We did our
own record, the entire thing from
producing, recording, packaging,
everything. As well, A&M’s going
full steam with promotions. That’s
why you sign!”

As with any band switching
from an independent to a major
label, there is the risk of offending
early listeners. “I don’t worry
about anyone else ’s opinion,” says
Cornell. “If people don’t like the
record itself, that’s fine, but it
shouldn’t matter what label it’s
on.”

Just before the Louder Than
Love tour, Hiro Yamamoto left
the band and Soundgarden found
a more than adequate
replacement in ex-Nirvana bassist
Jason Everman. “[Yamamoto]
wasn't really into all the touring,"
says Cornell. “He'd rather make
records and sit back and let the
checks come in the mail.”

With such a phenomenal

touring schedule, playing over
50 shows in two and a half“

months, you would think that

,Soundgarden’s emphasis would

be on playing live, but, “They’re
two completely different things,”

level of creativity is. That’s where

In light of Soundgarden’s
attention to creativity, the press

The Savoyards—a secret of Pittsburgh

By Scot Ross
Managing Editor

The scene could be expected
of a theater cast preparing for an
approaching opening night. Two
blindfolded men are being led
around the stage by a rope of
blue ﬂowers. “Vittoria,” the

conductor shouts, “where did

your notes go?” The music stops
and the woman signifies that she

- has made the correct adjustment.

Rehearsal reconvenes as a woman

- in the orchestra plucks the first
_ notes from her double bass.

Such is the case with the players
and crew of the Pittsburgh
Savoyards’ production of Gilbert

-and Sullivan’s The Gondoliers,

which opens Friday at Antonian
Hall, Carlow College, and opens
the 52nd season of the Savoyards.

. Working since the middle of
September, the 60-odd members

of the cast and full-accompanying
orchestra are much like a puzzle
picture. The pieces are
recognizable, but the picture is
not revealed until the ﬁnal shapes
are put into place.

This analogy is even truer of
the evolution of the’ Pittsburgh
Savoyards, from a group
interested in Gilbert and Sullivan
to the full-scale winter and spring
productions of today. It is, in fact,
a long—time puzzle that has been
fitted together, involving four
pieces: Tradition, Dedication,
Migration and Generation.
Tradition

The Savoyards began as a group
of people who in 1938 wanted to
do a benefit performance of
Pirates ofPenzarzce, according to
Yvonne Steele, who serves as
president of the Savoyards, as
well as playing the role of the

' Duchess of Plaza-Toro in The

Gondoliers.

“It just grew from there,” said '

Steele. “They got a good response.
It started very small. It was in a
church basement. Eventually,
over the years, the group
developed from one that did
maybe two performances of the
shows with just piano
accompaniment to the seven or
so performances we do now with
a full orchestra.”

The name Savoyards comes
from the Savoy Theatre in
England, where the Victorian—Era
Gilbert and Sullivan plays were
originally produced. The term
now applies to anyone who
fancies an interest in the writing
duo.

Pittsburgh Savoyards is the
oldest A amateur performing art
group in the city, said Harvey
Meieran, a violist in the orchestra
for the past 15 years. In addition,

    Look out
below

Meieran at one time served as
president of the board.

“God creates the heaven, the
earth and the Savoyards,"
Meieran quipped. A proud
member of the company, he ran
down a list of accomplishments
by the Savoyards, among them
being that they are older than
the Pittsburgh Opera, they are
the 4th oldest Gilbert and Sullivan
company in the country and that
they have successfully executed
shows incorporating as many as
65 people on stage.

The Savoyards used to perform
on Flagstaff Hill in the summer
and the overwhelming response
to this was a catalyst in the
formation of the Civic Light

' Opera. The Savoyards were also

the first performing group from
Pittsburgh to be featured on
television, when in the '50s,
station WDTV broadcast the

group's performance.

The Savoyards also claim
television “character” actor Bert
Mustin and well-known Pittsburgh
classical vocalist Mimi Lerner, who
returned last year to perform in
the company’s 50th anniversary
show.

Pittsburgh Savoyards has also
catered to the handicapped
population and in fact has been
innovative in allowing the hearing
and visually impaired to enjoy the
theater experience. Meieran
explained, “We’ve had the first
Braille guide for helping the blind
follow on-stage activities; the first
one ever for an opera. We've had
the first sign interpreters for the
hearing impaired for a Gilbert and
Sullivan opera.” '
Dedication

Pittsburgh Savoyards could not
have a glorious tradition if itwere

‘not for the dedication — the
second piece of the puzzle — of’

its members. This dedication is a
two-fold commitment in that the
cast and crew must dedicate
themselves to the execution and

4 planning. As well, they must do it

without adequate monetary
compensation, and at times even
worry about ways to raise money
for the organization.

With costs rising as high as
$15,000 per production, raising
capital is an inherent concern for
the members of the board.
According to Steele, besides ticket
revenues,
production costs are paid for_ by
individual sponsors, charitable
donations and some corporate
sponsors. Q

Five years ago, when the
Pittsburgh Playhouse increased the
price of using their theater, the

Savoyards were forced to find A 1

another place, which is why they
now perform, at Carlow College.
Steele is very satisfied with the
location, noting that the full
orchestra pit is a luxury not found
in many Pittsburgh theaters.
Steele credits Savoyards’ musical
director Bob Whitley with the first-

class quality of the orchestra. A

former director of both the Fox
Chapel Episcopal Church Choir
and the Alcoa Corporate Singers,
Whitley came to the Savoyards 26
years ago, serving as a conductor

for the keyboard. Through-

persistence and this dedication,

, Whitley was able to shape a full-

scale orchestra, something Steele
said most groups have to do
without.

“Overall, we're very much a,

volunteer group and people do
this because they love it, like any
other community theater,” she

continued. “What sets us apart is -

the kind of productions we do.
We produce very large musical
productions, comparable to a
major modern musical on a very
modest budgetwith full orchestra. ”

Money remains an obstacle,
despite the efforts of the Savoyards.
Rehearsals were delayed because
of the problems financing and
pinning down a stage director,

' said Steele. Eventually, Glenn Paris,

a graduate of Carnegie Mellon
University’s graduate directing
program, was chosen. _

As well as directing an opera

‘ workshop for CMU, he was also

the assistant director of Cincinnati's
Summer Opera last year. Steele
also is involved with CMU as she

No compensation for the time.
“Unless you call a headache

Migration

Ask Michael Fekete, a Pitt
transfer student, why he is with
the Pittsburgh Savoyards instead
of Pitt’s Studio Theatre and he'll
give two reasons. The first is his
love of musicals and Gilbert and
Sullivan. The second has to do
with the meager opportunities-

open to. Pitt theater
undergraduates.
“Although I’ve only been at the

university two years, I guess the
biggest thing I’ve noticed with
the theater department and it
being the first chance I had to be
involved with theater
academically, sort of outside of
the community theater, it seemed
that the undergraduates were
stuck with doing a lot of the

‘ menial work,” Fekete said.

He said the introduction to
performances classes were

 showing the students that acting

was all work and no fun. “There
was no outlet for them to be
involved in the shows. If they
had a chance to be an extra in a
show, they would walk on and
walk off."

Plays in the Studio Theatre are
chosen in relation to the master's

A of fine arts candidates. Fekete ,

believes that this takes away from.
the talent of those who just want
to act, not necessarily devote
their college career’ to it. “The
audition process pitted the
graduate students who have a lot
more experience and have a better
chance [against the
undergraduatesl,” Fekete said.
“I think there’s room for

__n_ undergraduates to develop. That's
why I feel it's necessary for the

program to be geared a little

more" toward undergraduates

because if they want to build the

program up, if they want stability,’
if they want it to grow in a

positive fashion, they need to
center on the undergraduates,

too.”

Fekete said that Savoyards gives
students in this predicament the
chance to see the enjoyment of
being in a theatrical production.
Generation

Perhaps generation—s, as the
Pittsburgh Savoyards spans
exactly that.. Not merely
generations in generic sense, but
generations of families. Several
fathers and sons, mothers and
daughters and vice versa act

' together in the Savoyards.
V ‘One example is Sean Hughes
and his daughter Megan. Sean, a
professor in the education
department at Pitt, has had a

 long-time love affair with the

works of Gilbert and Sullivan
since he was 4 or 5 years old. He
had acted up until his first year of
graduate school. .

, Hughes had been attending
performances of the Savoyards
since 1969 as an audience

 member, “and as the kid came
I along, we brought the kids along.

So they really got interested in
Gilbert and Sullivan," he said.

In 1986, Hughes’ wife talked
him into auditioning and soon
after, his daughter joined him on
stage. A senior in high school,
Megan is not the only of Hughes’
children to work in the Savoyards,
as his son, who is now in college,
performed while he still lived at
home.

Hughes has attended Gilbert
and Sullivan theater in England
and Ireland and was overjoyed
when he discovered Pittsburgh
had its own company.

“I’ve always loved [Gilbert and
Sullivan] and my parents would
always play the records of the
shows,” Megan said. “It’s been a
really great experience.”

The two concur that working
together in the theater has allowed
the two to become closer as a
family. “I don’t get to see him
very often. I have school in the
afternoons,” Megan said. “We
have dinner together once in a
while. In this, I get to see him in
rehearsal.”

“It’s just fun to be able to do it
as a family,” Hughes added.

The Gondoliers opens Friday
and runs through Nov. 19. For

Pitt's Amnesty International holds Human Rights Week

By John Jacobs
Staff Writer

As people across the world are
subjected to unjust prison
detainments, torture and
executions, Pitt’s chapter of
Amnesty International is holding

‘Human Rights Week this week in

an effort to raise awareness of
these abuses, and to increase
understanding of A.I.’s goals.

According to the organization’s
of purpose, the
following are Amnesty
International’s goals:

-The release of all “prisoners
of conscience”: those people
detained for their beliefs, race,
sex, language, religion or ethnic
origin, who have neither used
not advocated violence.

plain leather hats in her booth.

At another booth, Janis
Simpkins was selling much of the
same thing. Simpkins, _a
representative of “Njeri’s African
Arts and Accents," says that “all
of the merchandise was made in
Africa, especially in Kenya." She
said that many of her ideas came
to her while she was in Kenya
working as a literature instructor
for five years.

Along with many of the
carrybags on sale, Simpkins was
also selling ethnic foods from
Kenya. She sold cbapati, a dish
that she described as “pita bread,
Kenyan style.” It was a
combination of meat, various
green vegetables and rice, all
neatly tucked into a piece of
ﬂoury dough. Another food she
offered was her own recipe for a
dessert. It was called unga dunia,

a small, ﬂaky pastry with a black, .

jelly-like topping. “All of this
consists of a poor man’s meal,”
she said. ‘
I Sharon Davison, a local
entertainer, was selling many
different items, such as shoes,
small ‘ crafts and \ other
miscellaneous items. She even
had some -Pitt paraphernalia on
sale. '

Her most cherished -work,
though, was her calligraphy.
Davison had verses from Dan
Fogelberg written out and framed.
She also had the famous “When
You Wish UponA Star," byjiminy

Cricket, framed for posterityj

“Children want something soft
and light to identify with, and
often they turn tothings like

‘ this," she said.

Davison then presented a
picture of a unicorn, which she
said was a safe symbol. “Many
people associate animals, like
cats, to be dangerous to them,”
she said. “Unicorns, however,
pose no dangers, and therefore
are a safe symbol.”

Today, the Black Action Society

is holding a Minority Jobs Fair on .

0Fair and prompt trials for all
political prisoners.

oAn end to torture and
executions in all cases.

The objectives of A.I. are based
on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Written by Eleanor

‘ Roosevelt, the UDHR explains

that everyone has rights to life,
liberty, property, thought,
conscience and religion, among
others. Though the UDHR was
signed by every major country in
1948, over one-third of these
countries violate the UDHR,
according to Jennifer Coopie,

publicity coordinator of Pitt’s A.I. .

chapter.

Coopie explained that a
prisoner of conscience is helped
through an Urgent Action
Network. If someone qualiﬁes as

a POC, they are adopted by A.I.
Then, individual chapters send
“polite letters" to the violating
government or organization.

“Blaming governments doesn’t
work," said Coopie. “We only
state that we are aware of a
violation, and we ask that they
either charge the POC with a
legitimate crime, or release the
prisoner.”

Amnesty International got
attention in the mid-19805
because of huge rock concerts
and the South African apartheid
issue. Dennis Brutus, founder of
Pitt’s black studies program, was
arrested in 1963 and detained for
his beliefs. Brutus said, “The
founder of Amnesty attended my
trial injohannesburg and adopted
me soon after. This ‘helped to

publicize my case. I believe that
Amnesty played a big part in
getting me released [in 1965].”

Coopie said, however, that
because the South African issue
received the bulk of the publicity,
Amnesty lnternational’s goals
have become misunderstood by
the public. “We are a totally non.
political group. We concentrate
on our own narrow objectives
and not on any particular country
or issue."

For instance, Coopie said that
Nelson Mandela, who was
detained with Brutus, is “the most
well-known prisoner in the world
but has not been adopted by A.I.
because he believes the only
solution in SouthAfrica is a violent
overthrow of the government."

Coopie also said, “The situation
in South Africa is no worse than
anywhere else where violations
occur.” She cited a recent case
which occurred in Guatemala,

where eight people were arrested 1

for a “recognized peaceful

movement,” and four of these '
people were later found dead on .

the side of a road.

In such cases, A.I. chapters
continue to send letters to the
violating organization until.
decisive action is taken. Coopie_
said that former POCs “knew
when letters were coming
because their conditions
improved. If torture resumed, the
POCs knew the letter—writing had
Christmas/Hanukkah cards to
POCs.

Campus dental school treats handicapped patients

Byjenifer Crook
Staff Writer

It’s just after 1 p.m. on a
Wednesday, and the Pitt Dental
School’s_ Handicapped Clinic is
operating in full swing.

In one treating department, two
dental students have been placing
fillings in a patient with cerebral
palsy for over three hours. The
patient is under heavy sedation
to control a severe gagging reﬂex.

In the next stall, a three—year-
old Asian girl with Down’s
syndrome is being examined for
sores that have developed inside

1 her mouth and on her gums.

An older, mentally retarded
woman comes rushing into the
clinic after signing in to give her
favorite dentist a big hug and
kiss, and tells him she will only
be treated if he’s her dentist.

And down the hall in a closed

room, several dental students and

instructors are attempting to strap
an uncooperative patient to a
“papoose board” so that they can
work on his teeth.

Dr. Jay Reznik, clinic director,
darts down the corridor to assist.

“In 15 years I’ve only been
beaten up twice,” he said with a
smile after the task was
accomplished. “But right
afterward, they’ll forget about it
and give you a hug."

Reznik said that equipment like
the “papoose board” is only used
when necessary but is just one of

the things that separates
handicapped dentistry from other
types.

“It’s not punishment,” he said.
“We do it in the least restrictive
environment possible, and
ultimately it’s to help the patient
out. It’s meant as a positive, not a
negative thing.”

A trip to the dentist isn't usually
fun for anyone. And though most

patients have the impulse to gag,
cry and even ﬁght off a dentist,
“Normal persons can control these
urges,” Reznik said, “because
society tells them to do so. But
many handicapped individuals
don’t understand this and can’t
control those impulses.”

Many dentists shy away from.

treating handicapped patients,
Reznik said, because they don’t
know how to deal with the
gagging and fright that
handicapped patients often have.
Working in the clinic better
prepares dental students for these
situations in the future.

“It’s just noise, but the average
dentist is going to freak out when
these things happen. This type of
training really helps them out,"
he said.

Third—year dental student Tony
Maslo agreed.

“I took rm; because I was afraid
of handling retarded people. But
it’s really rewarding, probably
the most rewarding elective here.

And it’s eye—opening. Once you ,

work -with them, you realize

they’re just people and there's,

nothing to be scared about.
“The patients are very
appreciative of anything you do
for them,” he added. “They might
scream the whole time you’re
doing it, but you’ll be their best
friend when you’re finished.”
Located in the basement of the
dental school, the clinic treats
only physically and mentally

and fourth- year dental smdents
work in the clinic along with
three graduate students choosing
this class as an elective.

“It’s very beneficial to the
students, ” said Reznik. “They start
out being unsure of themselves,
but they catch on and we have a
really nice time. It’s really special
people who take this elective.
The average person would be
afraid to go near them, but we
treat them just like anyone else. It
just takes some extra TLC and
patience."

“‘It’s very challenging,” said
student Bob Petcash. “Much more
than _working on non-
handicapped patients. It should
improve my all-around dental
skills a lot. We get a lot of hands-
on experience here.”

Although handicapped
dentistry is not a specialty in
itself, Reznik said that special
training in treating the
handicapped is “getting bigger
for a number of reasons because
society is becoming more aware
of the needs of handicapped
people.”

Being handicapped does not
make a person’s dental problems
more severe, Reznik said. But
often a handicapped person’s
dental health is put by the wayside
because of the more serious
mental and physical problems
that get first priority for treatment.

“Many of them have never been
to the dentist before,” he said, “so
they usually have more gum
disease and decay. A lot of the

time we’re making up ground for

dental work they haven’t had '

done in years.”
Although the clinic focuses on
pediatric dentistry, there is no

age limit. The type of patient '

treated at the clinic also varies in
physical and mental
development.

Reznik said the clinic now treats
more than 1,000 patients each
year, averaging around 15 each
week. The patients come from
their own homes and state
facilities, such as Western Center
and Polk, and community living
arrangements, where they live
independently with other
handicapped people. Reznik said
that “crack children” have also
been ﬂown in from Philadelphia
to be treated at the center.

“There are clinics out there that I

can’t treat them, and we can.
We're a regional center for
handicapped dentistry."

Reznik said that the clinic is
growing each year as more
students enroll and more patients
are treated. He added that recent
donations of $100,000 from Ernest
Unrath, a Pitt alumnus, and
$30,000 from the Islam Grotto,
will also help the school purchase

new treating equipment and.

educational tools, such as
wheelchairs, specialized dental
chairs and video "tapes. The
money will also be used to help

Panthers hope to ‘weather’ Hurricanes storm

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Three different weather
forecasters showed up at the
pre_game press conference on
Tuesday, all offering their
predictions as to how Pittsburgh’s

: nasty natural elements will affect
7‘ the normally sun—drenched Miami

Hurricanes.

Miami has played four home
games in lovely Coral Gables,
Fla., and has played one away
game in the tropicalheat at Florida
State. The forecast for Saturday’s
nationally televised game at Pitt
Stadium calls for temperatures in
the low 405 with rain.

Will this be a detriment to the
Hurricanes?

Pitt defensive left tackle Jeff
Esters, originally from the
Sunshine State, experienced the
differences in the weather when
he started his college football
career a year ago at the University
of Pittsburgh.

“I think the weather is deﬁnitely
going to be a factor. I know some
of those [Miami] guys have never
experienced the winter before,”
Esters said.

“Being from Florida, I know my
hands got very cold up here, and

I just don't think they are going to
be able to deal with it as well as
we are.

“Right now in.Miami, it’s about
90 degrees, I think, and they're
going to come up here in an

atmosphere of 38 degrees? It’s-

got to have some kind of effect
onthem.” P a nth e r
freshman ﬂanker Olanda Truitt
simply said of the weather, “It
could be a factor.”

Hurricane head coach Dennis
Erickson was apathetic, saying “I
don't know if any type of weather
will be a factor in a game of this
magnitude.” I

The Hurricanes will bring a
potent attack on both sides of the
ball into town, along with some
impressive statistics on the year.

Miami has won 49 of its last 51
regular—season games and 25 of
its last 27 road games. The
Hurricane defense has been
stingy, to say the least, against the
run this season, allowing only
572 rushing yards in 285 attempts
for a measly 2.0 yards per attempt
mark.

Since the start of the 1987
season, Miami has held 17 of its
32 opponents to a touchdown or

\\ \\-~\\\\\ ~-\ \ ~ g

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

,Pitt's pass defense will face its toughest challenge Saturday when Miami comes to town.

eight games for a 10.4 points—per-
game average.

Hurricane defensive end Greg
Mark was recently selected along
with Pitt’s Marc Spindler as one

less, and in 1989, they have limited of 12 serni—ﬁnalists for the
[opponents to only 88 points in

.,Lombardi Award, given to the

best lineman in the country.

On offense, the Hurricanes are
equally impressive because of
depth and ‘talent. Backup

by throwing for 468 yards against

San Jose State on Oct. 14.

Pitt  

Conﬁnuedfrom page 1 incurred their ﬁrst loss against
more in receiving. Florida State the weekend of Oct.
Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried 28.

Both teams need a win this
weekend if they realistically plan
to challenge for a major bowl bid.

And after playing teams like
Cincinnati, Wisconsin and San
Jose State, Erickson also knows
he will have his hands full this
weekend against the 14th—ranked
Panthers.

“Pitt’s defense is’ very strong;
Marc Spindler is one of the
outstanding players in college
football and Alonzo Hampton is
as good as anyone in the country.

“Their offensive line is one of
the most physical we've seen;
and as for Van Pelt, you can’t ask
for more than he’s done,” Erickson
said.

Miami’s starting quarterback
Craig Erickson is still suffering
from a knuckle injury sustained
against Michigan State. No one is

acknowledged the fact that he
will have his hands full on both
sides of the ball this week.

“As I said after the Notre Dame
game, Miami is on a different
plane. Their defense is only
allowing opponents 71 yards
rushing and 149 yards passing,
and those are some very
impressive statistics,” Gottfried
said.

“Their defensive from four is
the best we have played and the
best we will play. We are certainly
going to have our work cut out
for us.”

Ironically, the Panthers and the
Hurricanes are in the same boat.
Pitt has just come off its first loss
of the season to No. 1—ranked
Notre Dame nearly two weeks
ago, ruining an unblemished
record. The Hurricanes also

certain which quarterback will
start on Saturday.

“[Craig] Erickson is only 80-85
percent, and he has a problem
gripping the ball because of the
swelling in his hand. When he
throws the ball, it just seems to
take off on him,” Coach Erickson
said.

On another ironic Pitt-Miarni
note, the last three times Pitt has
played the Hurricanes, the
Panthers have started backup
quarterbacks. In 1976, Pitt lost
Robert Haygood and Matt
Cavanaugh to injuries earlier in

the season. In 1984, John Congemi P

suffered a concussion in a game
prior to the Miami contest, and -in
1986, Congemi did not start
against the Hurricanes again due
to a back injury. Miami may find
itself in the same situation due to
Erickson’s knuckle problem.

In a more general sense,
Erickson is worried about the

“bad boy" image the Hurricanes
came to be known for under
Jimmy Johnson. Ever since the
“Team on a Mission” to be No. 1
dressed in army fatigues to
advertise their confidence and
eventually lost to Penn State in
the Fiesta Bowl in 1987, Erickson
has been attempting to shed that
image in his first season.

“I don’t want that image this
team had under Jimmy Johnson.
We just try to play hard and earn
our respect that way. Hopefully,
we'll get rid of that reputation in
the future,” Erickson said.

Past statistics indicate that this
game should not be a close one,
as the average margin of ‘victory
for the winner over the last eight
games in the Pitt—Miami series
has been 27 points. If the Panthers
win,- they will be guaranteed of a
third consecutive winning season
under Gottfried.

The Panther defense has not

allowed a player to rush for 100
yards or more in a game this year,
and has recorded 26 sacks.

“Miami is the same on defense
as we are; we're basically mirror
images of each other except for
secondary coverage," Gottfried
said.

Both Miami quarterbacks are
basic drop-back passers, as Van
Pelt is considered to be. “Erickson
looks to be a little more
experienced, but there's not much
difference other than that,”
Gottfried said.

The Panthers and Hurricanes
are teams which are very similar
in many ways, according to both
head coaches. Defense and
quarterback style are the most
notably similar.

Also common to both teams is
that they will be facing one of
their most difficult opponentsthis
season with high stakes in terms
of post-season play at hand.

Pitt's hopes

rest on

recruits

. By Rob Codispot

Staff Writer

Pitt basketball coach Paul
Evans, after losing all five recruits
to Proposition 48 this year, will
finally get some players who will
be eligible for their freshman
seasons. 0

Pitt received oral commitments
Tuesday from Omo Moses of
Rindge and Latin High School in
Cambridge, Mass., and Gandhi
Jordan of Oak Hill Academy in
Mouth of Wilson, Va. Both were
expected to sign letters of intent
yesterday, the first day of the
early signing period.

Moses’ and Jordan’s
commitments give Evans- three
incoming freshmen for the 1990-
91 basketball season. Shooting
guard Tim Glover from Texas
announced last week that he will
matriculate at Pitt next fall.

Moses, a 6—foot-1-inch point
guard, averaged 16 points and
eight assists per game last season
for Rindge and Latin, the alma
mater of Michigan guard Rumeal
Robinson and former
Georgetown and current New
York Knicks center Patrick Ewing.
He is listed as an honorable
mention All—American in Streetév

J Smz'tb’s college basketball issue

and was Metro Index Camp’s
Most Valuable Player this past
summer. After visiting ‘here last
weekend, Moses chose Pitt over
Stanford, Southern Methodist and
Boston University.

Jordan averaged 13.1 points
and three assists per game as a
junior for Oak Hill. The 6-foot-5-
inch shooting guardchose Pitt

Upset week in the NFL upsets balance of power

Editor's note.- Each week, sports
editorChrisBosak, assistantsporls
editor Mike Rampa and a guest
prognosticator will predict the
results of Sundays NFL games.

Chris Bosak was unable to give
his weekly reasons for his picks
because he was out of town in
New York City covering the Big
EastMedia Day. But, here are the
teams he thinks will prevail this
coming Sunday.

Scott" Campbell
Guest Prognosticator

Chicago at Pittsburgh: The
Bears should start winning again
now thatjim Harbaugh has settled

_ into as quarterback, but Bubby

will keep it close against a porous
defense. .
Miami at N.Y. Jets: Marino and
Co. will win this one big, unless
Tony Eason quarterbacks, then
they’ll win real big.

Minnesota at Tampa Bay: The
Vikings want to win it this year.
Little Vinny will not stand in their
way.

Indianapolis at Buffalo: The
Bills will roll. Jim Kelly just needed
a week back, that’s all.

Denver at Kansas City: There is .

nothing, repeat nothing wrong
with John Elway, just ask Chuck
Noll. Chiefs running back
Christian Okoye is the league’s
best plower. (How can you call
him a runner) But the Broncos

still have too much talent to lose.
- this one.

Green Bay at Detroit: Lastyear
this would have been a dog,
but this is the year of the
“Majik” man. Packers easily.
New Orleans at New England:
If the Pats can lose at home to the
Jets,then they can lose at home to
a real N.F.L. team too. “Ironhead”
Heyward will come back after a
disappointing game Monday night
and rush for four yards.
Washington at Philadelphia:
Doug Williams will not salvage
the Redskins dismal season.
Randall Cunningham will have a
great game, again. ’
Dallas at Phoenix: The
Cowboys win two in a row?
Yeah, right.
Cleveland at Seattle: I don’t
understand the Seahawks. They
have so much talent, but they're

not that good. I do understand
the Browns. ’Ihey’re good. They
win.

N.Y. Giants at LA. Rams: Wow,
the Giants are 8-1? The Rams
have lost four in a row? What the
hell, Rams.

Atlanta at San Francisco: The
49er’s might not ever lose a game
again, well at least not to the
Falcons. I hope Deion Sanders
chokes on his chain, er.., you
know, necklace.

L.A. Raiders at San Diego: Bo!
Bo! Bo! Bo!

Last week was a rough one in the
NFL. Tons oif upsets ahounded
and teams which were suppoed to
win did not. I thought I had

A Bosak on the ropes, but apparently
he slid away from me again, and
with the Vikings no less. Here's to
a victorious week for me.

Chicago at Pittsburgh: The
Steelers looked horrendous last
week and Noll’s - coaching is
something Einstein couldn't figure
out. Bears.

Miami at N .Y. Jets: The Jets will
remain in the airplane hanger
they will never get out of.

Dolphins big.

Minnesota at Tampa Bay:
Vinnie will choke against a
tenacious Viking defense. By the
way, nice lucky safety last week
boys!

Indianapolis at Buffalo: Kelly
and the boys will rebound after
last weeks lost to, hmmm, the
Falcons? Real powerhouse there.

Denver at Kansas City: Elway
looked impressive last week
against the black and gold and
the long ball will find its way into

the end zone several times this

Sunday in Arrowhead Stadium.

Rams are way overdue for a win.

Kellie Coons - School of Nursing
- 1993

Pitt is going to win because:

When Pittsburgh gets cold,

the Panthers get bold;

Florida may be hot,

however, Miami doesn’t have
what this cold spot’s got.

Then Miami gets scared

and they become impaired.

We're not a Disneyworld team.

We’ll rip them apart at the
seam.

James Gay - CAS - 1992

I have to stick with the home
team. Pitt is rebounding for a shot
at a major bowl, and I- feel the
team has put the Notre Dame loss

in the past. Ron Redmon will
have his best day in the backfield,
and Alex Van Pelt will keep his
footing on Pitt’s home turf. I’ll
take the Panthers, 24-17.

Nick Basso ~ CAS — 1993

Pitt will win if Van Pelt has a
good day and the secondary can
stop Miami's passing attack. The
defensive line will have to
pressure the quarterback and
keep Miami from jumping out to
a big lead. The only way Pitt will
win is if it is a low—scoring game.

John Callahan — CAS — 1991

Pitt will win the game by at
least three points. Miami is ripe
for another loss. Erickson will be
put out for the season.

John Sayfie — CAS - 1992
Miami should come out

victorious because of their
experience in big games and their
defense. The Pitt defense is solid
but young, just like the rest of the
team. Van Pelt should have a
good day if the offensive line can
hold off Miami’s defensive front.
It will be closer than the 10-point
spread. My prediction: 17-12.

Paul T atkovski - CAS - 1990
Miami is coming into town after
a frustrating loss to Florida State.
They’re [irate] and they can pass
(our weakness). Pitt’s only
legitimate showing this year is
the fourth—quarter miracle in

Morgantown. Pitt is having an‘

identity crisis right now. After
N.D. you have to think that maybe
we're not top-10 contenders. My
heart is with the Panthers, but my
head says go with the ‘Canes.

Atlantic Ten Conferences.
Both Maben and Kumar

but neither has recorded a

of Pitt's players

victory at singles or doubles.

Kumar said the competition
there is very tough.

“Some of the best players
there could go pro after
college,” he said, “especially
those from Harvard and
Princeton.”

Maben realizes they’ll be up
against some very good players,
however, “If we get a good
draw, anything could happen.”

Rosenthal, a freshman, will
be making his first trip to the
IT CA. He said the players there
are a cut above the current
competition and he’ll have to
be more than ready, both
physically and mentally. A

“My goal is to make it‘ past
the first round,” he said. .

Coach George Dieffenbach
said, “Hopefully we’ll have a
strong showing which would
cap-off our fall season.”

Pitt ready for ‘Canes

* - By Scott Campbell

Staff Writer

After two weeks of simmering
Over the Notre Dame loss, the Pitt
football team is ready to boil Over
and ﬁnally get out on the ﬁeld
again, starting fresh this week
against the Hurricanes from
Miami.

“[Notre Dame] is in the past

a now. We can’t bring back what

happened two weeks ago. We've
reviewed the films, and wesaw
the mistakes we made," said
Henry Tuten, Pitt’s leading
receiver. “We had a good week
of practice last week.”

Things won’t be much easier
this week against Miami. The
Hurricanes are also coming off a
big loss to Florida State two weeks
ago, excluding a 40-10 romp over
East Carolina last week, and. are
looking to get back on track.

A loss by either team will be its
second and could wipe out a
chance to play on New Year’s
Day. Miami still has a date with
Notre Dame on Nov. 25, and Pitt
must play Penn State the same

In the two weeks since the loss

‘ to Notre Dame, Pitt has tried to
focus on Miami.

“We dOn’t have any control
Over who's going to pick us if we
get chosen for a bowl game. But-
wedo have control over what’s
going to happen Saturday,” Tuten
said.

“Something we’ve stressed to

' Our players this week is to stay

loose, stay conﬁdent,” Pitt Coach
Mike Gottfried said.

“We’ve got to play smart and

tough this week, not dumb and
tough," added Tuten.

Gottfried seems especially
concerned about a mismatch on
the Pitt offensive and Miami
defensive lines.

“[Their linemen] have so much
speed. You'd like to get some
double teams along the way there,
but you can't because they make
you single up all those guys. If
they get a lot of pressure on us,
it's going to cause us a lot of
problems,” Gottfried said.

The defensive line of Cortez
Kennedy, Russell Maryland, Willie
Peguese and Lombardi Award
semi—ﬁnalist Greg Mark have
helped the ‘Canes hold opponents
to 71 yards rushing per game.
That figure drops to 50 yards per
game if you exclude Florida State,
who racked up 220 yards rushing.

“When you look at Florida State, .

yOu’re looking at probably the

- third-best team in the country.

They also ran Syracuse out of [the
Carrier Domel,” Gottfried said.

The Hurricanes have only
played Wisconsin (2-6), California
(3-6), Missouri (2-7), Michigan
State (4-4), Cincinnati (1-7- 1), San
Jose State (4-4) and East Carolina,
despite Gottfried’s' statement that
Miami has “beaten some very
good football teams.”

Another problem for Pitt will

be stopping the Miami passing
attack, which averages 316 yards
per game. Craig Erickson returned
last week after missing three
games. All that freshman Gino
Torretta did in Erickson’s absence
was set a new U. of M. record for
passing yards in a single game.

NEW YORK —— Big East
basketball sure has come a long
way in its first ten years. Before
the league formed back in 1979,
television exposure was hardly
even a dream for the nine teams
in the Big East.

Now, entering its eleveth
season, 68 of the 72 conference
games can be seen on the tube.

CBS Sports will televise ten
regular season games involving
Big East teams, as well as the
Big East Tournament—semiﬁnals
and championship game.

ESPN, the nation’s largest
cable network, will televise at
least 20 regular season games
with Big East teams. ESPN will
also show the entire ACC-Big
East challenge to be held
December 4-7.

The majority of the remaining
games will be televised on The
Big East Television Network.
This network includes stations

in each school's local area.
WTAE is the Pittsburgh local
network. The Big East Network
also boasts its weekly nationally

syndicated half-hour highlight’

show, “This Week in The Big
East.” This show, which runs
12 times during the season,
provides a weekly review of
Big East basketball, including
_interviews, statistics and
features.

.“I’m happy with [the
television coverage]. There was
a day when we couldn't get on
TV,” said Big East
Commissioner David Gavitt.
“I’ve been around long enough

‘ to know that in the entire 1970's

only two eastern teams
appeared on television.
“Now, the rest of the country
looks at us and says we’re on
TV too much, but we’re talking
ten years. [Television] is
something we’ve worked hard
at to try to understand and
manage it the best we can.”
Second year head coach of

the Providence Friars, Rick
-Barnes, is an advocate of the
exposure, but knows not to let
it get out of control.

“I think the coverage of the

league is great‘. It’s a double— ‘

edged sword, though. If you're
doing well, everybody knows
it. But if you're doing poorly,
people know it. Overall that's
what it's all about. It’s basketball
