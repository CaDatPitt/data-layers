F aeulty Raise Issue

Stays up i

11 Air

As Profs Crumble

The faculty raise question remained up in the air late

this week, and seemed as if it might stay there.

No comment was forthcoming from Chancellor R. H. I

Fitzgerald Wednesday, and faculty members generally seem-
ed to have adopted a ‘wait and see’ policy.

Faculty Senate members

admitted, however, that they

had made a mistake in tying ‘their raise request to their

earlier plea for elimination ofo

overload teaching.

“It gave the chancellor some
excuse for eliminating the
overload and pretending that
the entire question had been

, settled,” stated a professor.
Real Issue Obscured

They felt that the sudden elim-
ination of overload teaching had
obscured the ‘real issue’ of the
need for a living wage.

A College department head had
earlier asserted that overload was
‘not even the basic problem.’

Meanwhile, senior members of
the English department have been
asked to drop one advanced three-
credit course apiece, either to
eliminate their overload or to en-
able them to take over elementary

courses now taught by overloaded
instructors. It was not known

carried out in other departments.
One English professor, who
will ‘be forced to alternate his
- courses under the course cut,
said that such a policy, if
widespread, would lead to
‘academic anemia.’
Dean Stanton C. Crawford, how-
ever, pointed out that alternating
courses every other year has long
been a policy for specialized sub-
jects which do not draw large en-
rollments. He said that since the
enrollment drop which brought
on the recent budget measures is
‘expected to last only two years,

instruction in the various ‘divi-
vsions of the University. This rep-
resents a drop of 1657 under the
fall enrollment of 18,613.

The spring total is indicative of
the continued downward trend in
student population since an all-
time high of over 25,000 was
reached in the fall of 1947. By
1948 the number of students had
dropped to 23,000. In the fall of
1949 the decline continued with the
enrollment ﬁgures showing 20,374.

Decline Was Predicted

The huge enrollment in 1947
had been regarded as abnormal,
and a steady decline had been pre-
dicted. This year’s drop_may be at-
tributed both to the decrease in
the number of veterans using the
GI Bill and to the war in Korea
and the consequent implementa-
tion of the draft law.

Athletic Committee from Stu-

dent Congress at its last meeting on Tuesday.

On the ﬁrst ballot Shapiro ran
against Bill McKinley and ,Bob
Gardner. Gardner was eleminated
and Shapiro beat McKinley on
the second ballot,

Next year‘ will be the fourth
year that a student has served
on the Athletic Committee. Dario
Icardi, Bob Dickey and Don Ewart
were the three former represen-
tatives.

McKinley however did not go
out of the meeting without an-
other appointment. Along with
Cyril Wecht, Congress president,
he was elected to represent Pitt
at the National Student Congress
at the University of Minnesota

from Aug. 20 to 29.

During the two and a half hour

themselves. Study is done with a
recently worked out perfusion ap-
paratus.

This apparatus pushes ﬂuids
through a specially designed slide
chamber, in which the living cells
are kept. This simulates the cir-
culation of the blood through liv-
ing tissues in animal bodies.

With this apparatus solutions
can be compared with respect to
their action in protecting cells
against radiation damage. Both
normal and virus-infected cells
can be studied.

During the reactions, movies
are taken to record and facilitate
the study. The movies, together
with the slides, are also used ‘with
lectures to scientiﬁc groups,..both
of faculty and students inside the
University and to interested out-
side groups.

In connection with this work,
Dr. Buchsbaum is lecturing today
at the Army Chemical Center in
Maryland. He has also talked to
scientiﬁc men at Oak Ridge, Ten-
nessee, and the University of Chi-
cago.

Cadet Applications Still Open;
Defermeilts Still Up To Boards

College students can still apply for training as Air
Force pilots and navigators according to Staff Sergeant C. L.
Bowen of the Pittsburgh recruiting oﬂice.

S/Sgt. Bowen also gave the News an authoritative sum-

mary of current draft regulations,
culled from his talks with Pitts-
burgh and Harrisburg draft offic-
ials.

The ﬁnal word on whether
the student is deferred or not
is still up to his local draft
board. :

But in order to even qualify for
a deferment, the student must: (1)
Achieve a score of 70 or better on
the exams which will be given at
speciﬁed dates during the next
month, OR (2) Attain a certain
class standing, depending on what
year he is in at school.

Freshmen must be in the upper
half of their class and sophomores
must be in the upper two-thirds in
order to qualify for a deferment.
Juniors and seniors must be in
the upper three-fourths of their
class.

Graduate students must attain
at least a score of 75 on the defer-
ment test, as there are no provis-
ions made to qualify them on the
basis of their scholastic standing.

S/Sgt. Bowen emphasized that
everyone who is eligible to be
drafted should take the deferment
qualifying test. Even if the serv-
ices’ demands for men grow great-
er (which would probably cause
tightening of the class standing
qualiﬁcation for deferment) there
will be no retests. The scores made

 Money and Gripes

Students may take exception to the large play the
»News has been giving the faculty pay raise issue in the
last few_ editions. Some may feel that we have no right
giving over our already limited space, for which they pay
1.4 cents per issue, to the facultyrather than to the students.
The faculty, though they pick up the News, do not pay for it.
~ The fact is that students are directly concerned. They
will start paying higher tuition fees next year and they
' ~ ‘will be receiving less for it. We say this because we know
that cuts in the curriculum of several departments have
already been made, and more may be in the offing.

Even more serious, instruction may come from a de-
pleted faculty, supplemented by new teachers who can’t
demand higher pay elsewhere. And those veteran faculty
members who stay are becoming so embittered with their
lot that their work will suffer.

A black picture, indeed, but the one that looms largest
V _ in our ﬁeld of vision. Wthout good teachers, Pitt can cer-

iﬁtainly not expect to attract paying students, and it must
-have students to live. ’
.Under the circumstances, we don’t ‘feel that the stu-
dents have much of a gripe coming if their Spring Festival
copy suffered slightly from the space given to the faculty.

A Nasty Subject--_--Money L

For a long time the ﬁnancial status of
the faculty has been regarded in the same
light as Sex. Everyone knew the profs
"needed money to buy their patent leather
briefcases and tweed suits, but no one dis-

cussed it in polite company. Such a nasty A’

subject—money. V _

Certainly the profs must have given it a
good going-over up in the
Faculty Club and before
their emaciated children on

cared to admit it. Now the
whole subject has been
dragged out into the open.
The.profs are not on the
barter system as many sus-
pected; they use money like
the rest‘of us Americans.
And they want more of it.

Few people will deny their right to a
larger share of the crop. Many people will
be amazed that their share has been so small
in the past. The professional trappings of
the teaching trade has ‘thrown a cloak over
their actual needs.

-» Obviously they have fooled the Board of
Trustees who in their four (three this year)
meetings seem to have ignored matters mon-
etary. Or if the venerable “thirty” have been
aware that the teachers are in need of extra
cash, they have ‘done an excellent job of
sidestepping the issue. “Give them cake.”

There have been other people who have
shied away from the salary problem.
Somewhere out there among the Alumni,
there is a red,-hot, super-salesman who is
overlooking the opportunity to start another
“fund raising” program for the University.
It doesn’t seem to occur to our better heeled
graduates that giving money to the ‘Univer-

“You know,” Freida told Franny, “this
school is a strange place.” _

They were nursing-a couple of cokes in
the Tuck,Shop and talking over the big Car-

“Yes,” Franny agreed, “pretty weird
sometimes. Look at the Carnival . big Wild

they tell us we better not

“Ladylike—schladylike,”

took a long sip of coke.
“Did ‘you hear what they
told the Cwens?”

“Yeh, their advisor told
them something the other day about Cwens
being ladies . . . and you know how the rest
of it goes . . . ‘ladies just don’t wear jeans.’ ”

Freida tapped her straw on the side of

Stop, friend, before you. jump from that

' There can be a great deal of good learn-

this is lost under a stream of continual lec-

the semester and read throughout. the year

Then what would be done in class?
The lecture-note orator would be lost, it
is true, but the good teacher would welcome
the chance to have the class meeting serve
its real purpose: to provide for the teacher-
student and student-student relationship
that is the only purpose of classroom edu-
cation. . ‘

Group discussion, not aimless, but with

P Pitt-State Track Meet 911 Tap
    Panthers Underdog
In First Home Meet‘

By DON SCHURMAN

Sports

Pitt’s tracksters at last get a chance to show their stuff‘ i
to the home crowd when they meet Penn State at the Sta-

dium tomorrow.

  
  
   

Writer

The meet marks the first appearance of the Panthers at 

home, and their last dual meet of the season.

Field events will get under way at 12:30, and the first
running event, the mile, will begin at 1:
be admitted by presenting their IDO*—————~

cards or by the admission price of
50 cents.
The Panthers go into the meet

with a 2-1 record, while Peni

State, in their only meet, lost to a
loaded Navy team, 82-49. How-
ever, State has some of the nations
top runners.

Close Meet Seen

From all indications tomorrow's
meet may be the closest Pitt-State
classic in years. Event for event,
the two teams stack up evenly,
With perhaps a slight edge going
to the Nittanies.

Pitt has a strong edge in the
shot put and discus, with the pos-
sibility of clean sweeps in these
events if Coach Olson can come up
with another shot putter,

To counter any Pitt ﬁeld events
sweeps, however, Penn State has
a stronghold of distance runners.
State's Bill Ashenfelter and Bob
Freebairn should give Frank Kuz-
ma his toughest competition of the
season in the mile.

Both of the Nittanies consistent-
ly run under 4:20, although Kuz-
ma was able to nose out Ashen-
telter last year.

440 Sore Spot

Sprinting points could fall either
way, with both teams looking
weak. With Dick Firsching still out
of the lineup, the 440 will ‘be a
Panther-sore spot.

Pitt plays its ﬁrst—and on1y—home track meet at the

Stadium tomorrow, and the best has been saved for last.

Penn State’s top-ranking thinclads help Carl O1son’s

crew close down their dual meet season.

The meet ought to be a real
thriller, although the Panthers
will be deﬁnite underdogs.
However, the Panthers seem
to enjoy underdog roles at
home.

Two years ago, a powerful

Wayne University team arrived 1?;

at the Stadium and ﬁgured to run
the Pitt trackmen off the ﬁeld.

lest Feet Forward

But Olson’s thinclads put their
best feet forward and upset
Wayne, 70-61, by winning the
ﬁnal race of the day, the mile
relay.

Then last year, Notre Dame
appeared here, and again Pitt
was the underdog. Some
thought Pitt should not even
be on the same ﬁeld as Notre
Dame. It would be a sorry
spectacle, they said.

But they reckoned without the
Panther thinc1ad’s great competi-

, tive spirit. The Panthers went all

out and pulled a great victory
over the Irish, 65% to 651/2;.

So, tomorrow, Pitt again
has assumed its underdog
role. And the question is, can
the Panther thinclads do it
again? Why not come out and
ﬁnd out? It’s the best attrac-
tion on the Pitt spring sports
card.

woke the mittmen out of their
early season lethargy? More
probably, however, the answer
to their winning streak lies
in the caliber of the opposi-
tion.

Pitt already has one bowling
team entered in the intercollegiate
tournament tomorrow and may
have another if a few more bowl-
ers can be rounded up.

The tenpin tournament will be
run off at the Palmer Classic A1-

'leys in Carrick with teams from

seven schools in addition to Pitt
entered.

Herb McGibbeny, phys ed in-
structor, who is supervising the
tournament, has issued a call for
any bowler on campus who can
roll a 175 or better to get in touch
with him today at Trees gym.

Last year's winner, Youngs-
town, is one of the schools en-
tered along with Western Reserve,
Slippery Rock, Carnegie Tech,
and Gannon.

PiKA, Sigma Chi in Playoffs

By LEE BANJANIN

IM Reporter
T h e fraternity softball
league opens its playoffs for
the championship today.
PiKA, Section 1 winner,

meets Sigma Chi, runnerup in
Section 3, at Ellsworth ﬁeld at
4:30.

The teams that ﬁnished one-
two in the three fraternity sec-
tions will vie for the IF title.

Two more contests are slated
for Monday at Ellsworth. The
SAE’s, winners in Section 3, play
the Phi Kaps, Section 2 runner-
ups at .5:30, while Section 2
champs, Delta Tau Delta, take on
the Phi Eps, second place holders
in Section 1, at 6:30.

The winners of these three
games advance to the semi-ﬁnals,

with one team to draw a bye.
SAE’s Cop

A surprising SAE nine captured
the Section 3 championship by de-
feating Sigma Chi, 8-7, in a play-
off, Wednesday afternoon at Ells-
worth ﬁeld.

SAE, aided by two costly Sigma
Chi errors in the seventh inning,
tallied the tying and winning run
on Dick Lunn's timely double
down the left field line.

SAE quickly moved out to a
three run lead in the ﬁrst inning,
putting together two walks with
two hits.

Sigma Chi Rallies

But Sigma Chi ‘bounced right
back with six runs in their half
of the ﬁrst, producing five hits and
a walk off SAE’s pitcher Don
Schimmel.

SAE then settled down and pro-
ceeded to peck away at Chi’s

pitcher Ralph Henry for a single
run in the ﬁfth, two more in the
sixth, and rallied for those two
big runs in the seventh.

Hitting honors went to Gene
Perosa who contributed two im-
portant singles in the later innings
to start SAE on its way.

On Tuesday, Sigma Chi had
eliminated the Phi Gams from
Section 2 playoff contention by
trouncing them, 19-6. A home
run by Dick Raunswinder fea-
tured the Sigma Chi attack.

‘Defective’ Speech Department
Helps Afflicted Students

By GENE WEINSTEIN
Staﬁ“ Reporter
One afternoon last year a student burst into speech cor-

rectionest Dr. Joe Ball’s ofﬁce and asked if f‘it was the de-

fective speech department.”

A psychology prof talking with Ball doubled up with

laughter. “So this department’:.
defective,” he chortled.

At any rate the student had
stumbled into the right place. He

D had walked into Remedial Speech,

the purpose of which is to help
any student overcome any type of
speech difficulty.

For the sake of accuracy, it
should be mentioned that the stu-
dent was sent to the psych depart-
ment for further help.

Dr. Ball quipped, “And at last
reports no word has been re-
ceived as to whether he found
them defective or not.”

The department divides its
groups under three general head-
ings: foreign dialects, voice qual-
ity, and articulation.

Ball Heads Department

Helping to solve the various
problems arising rom these dif-
ﬁculties are Dr. Joe Ball, assist-

‘ ant professor of speech and grad-

uate of Texas and Southern Cali-
fornia, and Anne Grey, a Pitt
alumna. Miss Grey also teaches
speech reading at the Ear and Eye
Hospital.

Their office boasts a variety of
speech and hearing aids as difficult

to pronounce as they are to spell.

One of these is the wet spero-
meter. This, says Dr. Ball, “checks
vital capacity. That is maximum
exhalation following maximum in-
halation.” .

In plainer words it tells how
much wiiid you have.

Homework Causes Knockout

Anything can happen in the
remedial speech class. Miss Grey
tells of the student who complain-
ed that the assigned speech exer-
cises caused his jaw to go out of
joint. The student felt that this
was a case of homework literally
knocking him out. «

Remedial speech, in existence at
Pitt for the past few years, is pro-
vided for the students as a service
by the University.

No Stigma Attached to 01

“Taking speech Ol,” declares Dr.
Ball, “places no stigma whatsoever
upon the student. We’re up here to
help those who need it.”

One of Ball’s former students,
Dan Purdy, now a varsity debat-
er and member of Mens Council,
says, “In debate as well as in life
in general, no course has helped
me more than Remedial Speech.”

Spring Carnival
Show ‘Deflated’

For Television

How far will television go
in showing low necklines and
high hemlines? Not as far as
Pitt's Spring Festival,
dently.

Producer Burt Harris and
emcee Bill Grant of WDTV’s
Studio Control (11:30-12.30)
caught the act of the “An-
drews Sisters” at the Carnival
Tuesday night and liked it so
well that they decidedto put
it on Thursday’s show. The
“Andrews Sisters” act is a
record pantomime by three
of the huskiest men in the Tri.
Delt-PiKA show, complete
with mop wigs and balloons
for “busting.” It’s called “Big
Bust From the West.”

At rehearsal, Harris took
one look and nearly passed
out. Fifty-nine inches was
going a bit too far, and the
hemlines . . .!

The red-faced trio, Cline
Denault, Frank Scarpella, and
Bill Godejohn, retired behind
a screen, reduced their ﬁgures
to a girlish 30, and lowered
the hemlines. “That's better,”
said Harris, and the show
went on.

Comr_nons_Ball for All Students,
Publicity Chairman Stresses

The Commons Room Ball, set
for Friday, June 8, is open to all
students, though only graduating
seniors are receiving printed in-
vitations.

This fact was stressed by Pub-
licity Chairman, Alberta Ignelzi,
who wants to make clear that all
students are welcome at the
dance, which will be the first held
in the Commons Room.

Tickets are on sale at the Stu-
dent Desk for $4.50 per couple.

Music for the dance will be pro-
vided by Claude Thornhill and
his orchestra.

The dance committee, chaired
by Student Congressman Bill Mc-
Kinley, has planned decorations
for the Blue Tuck Shop and the
first floor court facing Bigelow
Boulevard.

Decorations in the Commons
Room will include ferns and sil-
houettes.

Druids Meet Today

There will be an important
meeting of Druids today at
2:30 p.m. in 832 C1. All mem-
bers should be present to dis-
cuss banquet plans and other
forthcoming activities.

Draft Headline

Was Erroneous

A headline in Wednesday’:
News erroneously read “Draft

The correct information is that

the Educational Testing Service“

must receive applications for tak-
ing the test by the deadline, May
25.

The testing dates still stand at
May 20, (for which applications

are no longer open), June 16, and , _

June 30.

A special test is set for Thurs-
day, July 12, for students whose"
religious convictions prevent their
taking the test on a Saturday.
