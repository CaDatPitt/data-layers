Panel
Debates ,
USA TODAY

By TOBY TROSKY I

A reader recently called the USA
Today offices to complain that the
paper was guilty of false advertising
when it said it delivered the paper via
satellite; he said he had seen it being
delivered by a truck that morning,
Nancy Woodhull, managing editor
of USA Today said last night.

Woodhull made that comment as
she opened a panel discussion
entitled “USA Today: Journalism
Or Junk Food?” last night in the
William Pitt Union. The discussion
was sponsored by the Pitt Contem-
porary Writers Series in conjunction
with the English department.

Woodhull also said that the
Pulitzer Prize committee formed a
new category that USA Today is cer-
tain to win called “best investigative
paragraph.”

Those comments framed the dis-
cussion of the Gannett Corpora-
tion’s attempt to establish a daily
‘nationwide newspaper. The other
guests on the panel included editor-
ial members from three of the’state’s
largest newspapers. John'Crai'g, J r.,
editor of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette; Ron Patel, assistant man-
aging editor of Th'e Philadelphia
Inquirer; and Madelyn Ross, man-
aging editor of The Pittsburgh
Press.

Woodhull‘ opened the discussion
by saying that America is a country
filled with “news junkies.” USA
Today gives “news junkies a
national newspaper.” V

Gannett ‘enlisted the help of the
Lou Harris and Simmons marketing
research firms to see if the idea
would work and made projections
for readers’ response. USA Today,
she said, is actingi“like indulgent
parents; giving readerswhat they
want." .

Woodhull said journalismtoday
is too elitist and the newspaper is
trying to get back to the basics of

, journalism-

“The who, what, where, why in
the lead and then the icing,” she said.

Readers of the newspaper, she
said, can find out what happened
yesterday today and can be
informed quickly and comfortably.
Another reason behind its success —
its circulationis over 1 million — is
that the paper is predictable. Read-
ers know exactly where everything is
going to be when they pick up a
copy.

It’s for this reason the newspaper
has been nicknamed “McPaper."

“A person can walk into McDo-
nald‘s every day and know what to
expect; it’s predictable," Woodhull
said. “There’s nothing wrong with
predictability.”

Patel said the surveys his paper
has taken have shown that USA

Stoned

By CHERYL SIRKO

“I had just tripped out on
microdots [acid] at my friend’s
cabin in the Pennsylvania moun-
tains," Max said “We decided to
take a walk through the woods to
wear it off. Before we got very far
into the woods, I realized I was
being watched. I told my friend
about this, but he thought I was
crazy. Then I saw that pairs and
pairs of glowing red eyes were on
every tree, staring at me!

“I ran out of the woods as fast
as I could, but when I got to the
main road, I thought I saw some
kind of monster.”

“Not a pretty sight,” said
Max‘s friend, who was with him
at the time.

On another occasion, Max
took a microdot and went to
1- class. Not only did he report see-
ing the walls breathe but also
hearing intense colors and seeing
voices.

Max is a 20-year-old student
at Pitt who’s put drugs out of his
life. He recommends that stu-
dents not make the same mis-
takes he did.

“Drugs can black out every-
thing,” he said. “Some drugs,
includingvQuaaludes~, can make
you belligerent. I had a friend
who wrecked his car three differ-
ent times, and each time he was
on ‘ludes. l’ve also seen a lot of
people almost kill themselves.”

Floyd, another student at Pitt,
talks about why he has used
speed and alcohol to help‘him
through school.

“Speed is not for recreation. A
lot.of people do it to cram for
tests. Coffee serves the same
function for some people.

“With speed, you don’t eat;
you don’t sleep. You get wired. It '

"I. makes yo_u'_tallga-,lotf——‘ you think‘ '_ _

you’re making sense, but no one‘
else‘ does.

“I used to drink a bottle of
Southern Comfort almost every
night to unwind.” Floyd, like
many other college students-,
drank heavily as a reaction to
personal and academic
problems.

Floyd received treatment for
his drinking problem last year
outside of Pitt. The treatment,

though, did not help him as
much as getting away from his '

source of pressure did.

Pitt now has a new treatment
center for students with alcohol
and drug-related problems. It’s

 

part of Pitt’s Counseling Center.
Although it went into operation
this fall, it's been in the planning
stages for several months.

A student is referred, to the
program if he commits an
offense. while using alcohol or
drugs. The program is adminis-

te,r‘ed‘.. .i‘_n ta. .’classroom’.setting.« v

where students learnabout the
process of addiction and prob-
lems of abuse. Treatment usually
lasts about a month.

The sessions also give students
an opportunity to talk with Dr.
Kathleen Peoples. Peoples
received her Ph.D. in clinical
psychology at the University of
Michigan and began working at
Pitt last August.

“Alcohol and drug abuse are
common problems in student
populations,” Peoples said.

“The program is also open-to
students who have an alcohol or
drug—related problem and want
help. It’s also open‘to students

 
 

who want to learn more about
drug and alcohol abuse,” Peo-
ples said. ‘

Students who would like help
with such problems can receive it
at the Counseling Center in the
William Pitt Union or at Student
Health Services in Brackenridge

Vandals
Smash

Windows  

Campus police are trying to deter-
mine who threw glass objects at the
William Pitt Union atrium and '
cracked five panes at approximately
2:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. - »

According to Lt. Jim Watters, th
campus police have some good leads
in the case and are following up on
them.

“We have a few students who are
doing their part and providing us
with information,” he said. “And
that information seems very good.”

Although the cost to fix the dam-
aged panes is not yet known, Andy
Smith, director of student activities,
said it will be quite expensive.

Smith said that unless the people
responsible for the damage are iden-
tified and forced to pay, the repair
costs will be paid by the student
population. .

The panes of the atrium are ther-
mal, unlike normal. glass 'windows,
he said. There are three layers mak-
ing upeach individual pane. The
outside layer is copper coated to
reflect the heat; there is a vacuum in
the middle with laminated glass,
which is very strong, on the inside.
_ The objects that hit the atrium
only cracked the outside layer, so

none of the glass shattered .i_n_to-“the ' '

building, Smith said. Because of the A
nature of the panes, all three layers-'
will have to be replaced —' which
could take at least threemonths.

Smith said that the cracks not
only look bad but give the impres-
sion that students won’t take careof ’
the building. , '

“We took some eggs on the roof
the first week we were opened, but
that was cleaned up,” he said. “We
thought we would get some eggs, but
we didn’t think that someone would '
malicously destroy something so
beautiful.”

The vandals,’ Smith said, are not-
representative of the entire student
body but‘ are people with criminal
intent. .

Although neither Smith nor Wat-
ters would speculate from where the
objects that broke the panes were

thrown, Smith did say they had to E» ‘

have come from “on high” in order
to have the velocity to crack the win-
dows, and unless the student union
had been attacked by a plane, the
objects had to come from one of the
dorms surrounding the building.
The objects could not have been
thrown from the ground.

for RSA I

By was icomsn

Filling an almost empty office
with furniture was one of the first
steps in a reorganization plan the
Resident Student Association
(RSA) hopes will give‘ the group
a"_new look.’ for 1983.

Along with that new look goes
a new philosphy of catering to
the students, which both the
association’s executive board
and resident hall representatives
have tried to adopt. .

According to Allan Gross-
man, president of RSA, “We’re
trying to cater to students —— that
really is the [purpose] of RSA,
It’s their money, and if their idea

A is feasible, Qweqfll run it.

By CHELLE J. HRITZ

Molly T. Vogt, Ph.D., profes-
sor of biochemistry,was recently
selected as a Fellow in the Ameri-
can Society of Allied Health Pro-
fessions (ASAHP). She will be
receiving this honor during the

nation for fellowship in ASAH P.
Her recognition has been
obtained by her outstanding ser-
vice to society by way of the
School of Health Related Pro-
fessions and also independently.

Vogt has chaired the group's,

education committee for four
years. She initiated the first task
force on the status of women in

 

Allied Health. In 1981, she
planned and chaired the ASAHP
National Conference on continu-
ing education. Additionally, she
has been the associate editor of
the Journal of Allied Health Pro-
fessions for seven years.

Vogt received her Ph.D. at Pitt
and has been a member of the
faculty_since 1970. She is located
in the School of Health Related
Professions. Currently, she is an
instructor of human physiology,
management and neuroscience.

have a great deal to learn, and most
importantly, it shows that technol-
ogy is profoundly changing the
nature of thejournalism profession.

Ross said a newspaper's job is to
inform, entertain, monitor public
welfare and explain. She said USA
Today does two out of the four well
— it informs and entertains.

“It doesn’t monitor public welfare
or explain what is going on as local
newspapers can,” Ross said.

Many stories in USA Today are
only three or four paragraphs long,
and Ross said those types of stories
do not explain enough ofthe story to
the readers.

“When USA Today works in con-
junction with local papers, it’s a
good complement. The two must
work together,” Ross said.

Woodhull said that the intent of
USA Today is not to replace any
local newspapers. It only wants to
bring national news to the country,
whether the news is in East Texas or
Boston.

Throughout the evening, the main
point of the discussion was the fact
that USA Today’s stories are so
short. Woodhull said local newspap-
ers do not cover national news ade-
quately, and USA Today is only

filling that void.

Vandals
Awaken A

After keeping quiet for some time, the Pitt
vandals are back and hard at work destroying
university property and making life tough for the
rest of the student ‘population. _

Early Tuesday morning, glass Ob_)CCtS were
thrown at the William Pitt Union atrium, crack-
ing five window panes. Because the windows are
custom-made, they will be expensive to replace. If
the vandals are not caught and prosecuted, the
rest of the students will have to pay for the dam-
ages out of their own pockets. . _ _

Andy Smith, the director of student activities,
said the vandals are not representative of the

' entire student body.

Although it may be true that the majority of
Pitt students are innocent of this crime and are
probably condemning it, these are the ones that
will be hurt by it.

The university spent $13 million dollars to
make the new student union one of the finest in
the country. Students helped pay for the renova-
tion because it’s their building, and yet some of
them took it upon themselves to damage part of
what they helped pay for.

During the grand opening ceremonies last
month, one Pitt administrator said that the Wil-
liam Pitt Union was too nice for the students and

t that the students would not take care of it. Tues-

day’s act of vandalism gave proof to the adminis-
trator’s comments and will leave a bad
impression on the minds of the university admin-
istration and the Pittsburgh community.

Even though most of the students do care .

about the building, it is made obvious by the
holes in the atrium that several do not. Those few
are a bad reflection on everyone and make it look
as if the students as a whole could not care less.

The vandals need to be caught and prosecuted,

both within the university and city judicial sys- '

terns. They should know that this act will not be
tolerated by anyone, and would-be vandals may
be deterred from committing a crime. The Pitt
News urges any student who witnessed the van-
dalism or knows who committed the act to con-
tact the Department of Public Safety
immediately and aid in its investigation.

Letters To The Editor

Tiger Paul Controversy

Sides Need To Come Together

Dear Editor: _

The announcement that Pitt bas-
ketball practice begins on Oct. I5,
1983, brought to mind those exciting
times we shared last winter at the
Field House when Pitt “beat the
hell" out of several Top 20 teams in
front of a raucous, sold-out crowd.
However, it also reminded me of the
need to have a united front this year
between students, cheerleaders and
Tiger Paul.

Coach Chipman made it quite
clear last year_that the cheering by
Pitt fans helped his team as much as
anything to the several upset victo-
ries at home. If we ever hope to have
a true home court advantage and
help our team compete in the Big.

East, pettiness, jealousies and per-
sonal vanity must be subordinated
to a team effort. It is rude and imma-
ture to be completely unresponsive
to the cheerleaders who are students
and friends who give a lot ofthem-
selves for Pitt. Similarly, it is absurd
to think that a student body will be
-responsive to a dance routine with
two minutes to go in a three point
game. Lastly, while Tiger Paul
means no harm to the cheerleaders,
it is obvious that he is better received

-by the students. He seemed to recog-

nize this conflict last year, and he
made a conscientious effort to sub-
ordinate himself to the cheerleaders
until the point where the demand for
his appearance was so high that he
could no longer do so.

Pitt is now presenting a first class
basketball program with players and
a coaching staff who should expect
to see_a jammed-packed Fitzgerald
Field House every time they take the
floor. They also deserve to have the
enthusiastic support Oi all fans. Its
just more fun to play and watch the
game when the crowd is behind the
team.

I urge all three sides to come
together and settle the differences
that have existed for too long. We
are on the brink of having a basket-
ball tradition at this school that
could rival any other program in the
nation, but it must have united fan
support to succeed.

Reader Recites Track Record  

Dear Editor:

I think I have discovered. your .

game! You know, you print a story
that insults a campus group and sit
back and wait for a flood of letters
from irate readers. That’s good for
you because it gives you something
to fill the spaces between all ofthose

expensive ads, space that otherwise.

would be filled with senseless drivel

written by your own editorial staff.

And we all know nobody really

wants to read any more of that!
Let's examine your record:

0Christina Clinton vs. The Who -
yes, that was a good one, insult rock-
n-roll, and you’re guaranteed a flood
of letters for a month!

,ODiane Lefkowitz vs. Pitt Foot-
ball -— insult a team by saying that
all the “superstars are gone” and
they aren’t worth the price of admis-
sion, and you get three or four
letters.

OTodd Erkel vs. Sororities —-— that
one was brilliant! You get a guy to
say something stupid about sorori-
ties, and you have a scandal that
won’t disappear for months to come.

OThe Editorial Board vs. PPC
Lecture Committee — The argu-
ments you used in this one were so
stupid and unrelated to the issue at
hand that the only reason you had to
print it was to irritate the PPC.

The point I’m making is that you
have come to realize that no one
really cares what you print unless it
is insulting to some campus organi-
zation. Maybe you should try to find
some real stories to write about and
quit imitating The National
Enquirer. When you do that, maybe
students will start to view The Pitt
News as a real source of informa-
tion, until then, The Pitt News
should be viewed as our version ofa
sensationalistic tabloid.

In their new offices in the fourth
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union, the
student media at Pitt have been
receiving a facelift while the building
has been getting a new look.

- Paid for by your student activities
fee, the student media consist of,
among others, WPGH radio, which

. is looking forward to FM status, the

Panther Prints yearbook and Back-
space literary magazine, both of
which are trying to acquire organi-
zation, consistency and more
readership.

The Pitt’ News is enjoying four
new visual display terminals
(VDTS), which allow writers to write
their stories on a screen and editors

’ ‘and copyeditors to work on them

from the screen as well.

Also new to The Pitt News is a
Velox photography machine, which
enables photographers to enlarge,
‘reduce and screen pictures and
advertisements right at the office.

Even though it is already one

. month into the school year, each of

the media is still encouraging new.
people to join up and participate.

WPGH, the university radio sta-
tion, is located at 640 on the AM dial.
This past summer, though, engi-
neers approved a plan that would
enable the station trybroadcast on
the FM band.

According to media adviser Larry
Lunsford, “The FCC construction
permit has not arrived_yet, but we
expect to receive it within a few
days.” When this happens, Pitt- will

In 1981, after 74 years, Pitt’s year-

This year’s co-editors, Larry

‘Mann and Mary Gillespie, plan to‘

make many other changes, particu-
larly in their sales campaign which
begins Oct. 31. ‘

“We hopeto_promote awareness
of the yearbook- "among the stu-

"already been sent out to students
and their parents. We also plan to *

sell books to the faculty and admin-

increase "the size, page count, and
number of color pages in the book.-

800 copies, but this year, we expect
to sell at least 1,500 copies. The cost
of the book will be $20, including
mailing,” Mann said. ,
“Something else which has never

_been done. before is our new aca-

demic section. Thisis, after all, why
we come to__school, and we’d like to
highlight the university’s different

departments and special pro-
grams,” he said. .
' Pitt’s literary magazine, Back-

space will also be undergoing some
changes. Althoughcertainly not a
newcomer to Pitt’s student media,
the existence of ‘Backspace has,
unfortunately, remained relatively
unknown to many students in past
years. ,

Editor Mike Chabon would like to
make the magazine more
accessible.

“We want to go on a subscription
basis and possibly advertise in other
magazines,” Chabon said. “This

""I'hi_s year‘s association is

Grossman said.
“Last year, we formed commit-
tees that never got off the
ground. Now we "have people

I ‘from each hall who talk to the

committees; it gives us a sharper
focus on problems.”

The formation of new commi-
tees and some of the other
streamlining that RSA under-
went are the result of a confer-
ence conducted at Penn State
this summer, which six of the
group’s members attended.

According to Grossman, over

- I50 schools attended the confer-
ence, which included 20 daily
workshops. Pitt’s representatives
came away with four new pro-
jects for this year

“RSA Changes Its Look

The residence office is over-
loaded with program ideas and is
very pleased with student
_response, according to
Grossman.

New programs such as Quad-
mania have already been attemp-
ted, and an Octoberfest is
planned.

One of reasons the RSA has
been able to expand itsactivities
is an increase in funding. This
year's budget is approximately
$3,000 larger than that of last
year, due to a bigger share of the
monies alotted by Student
Government.

According to Grossman, part
of that money has gone into
increasing the visibility of the
group.

“We're trying to spend the
money and get as much exposure
as possible,” Grossman said.

Vietnam: A History

Course First for Public TV

By RICHARD SCHNAP

College courses have been offered
on cable television for a few years,
but starting tonight, students will be
able to obtain college credit by
watching a show on non-pay TV.

The show, “Vietnam; a TV His-
tory” is being televised on WQED—
l3 and incorporated into courses at
six local colleges.

Dan Neil, executive director of

the Pennsylvania Council on Higher
Education, said, “We felt it was so
important, we wanted to make it
available.”
, The courses, offered at Pitt, Point
Park College, Robert Morris Col-
lege, LaRoche College and two
branches of Allegheny Community
College, will use the show in differ-
ent ways and through different
departments.

At Pitt, the course is being offered
through the department of sociology
and is being taught by Professor

_ Jerome Laulicht.

Laulicht’s course, entitled, “The
History of Vietnam and Interven-

will attempt to show the parallels
between Vietnam and intervention-
ism today. Laulicht hopes the show
will “get people thinking about

His class, offered through the

have been calls from Vietnam veter-

provide materials. Healso believes
that the show cuts across barriers
and is a natural choice for a full
effort in developing prime-time
telecourses.

To facilitate more of these efforts
in the future, the council will spon-
sor a telecourse conference to invite

instructors to learn more about this

use of the media.

_ The first two segments of the show

The l3-part series will then run on
consecutive Tuesdays and will be

State Store Returns

Oakland Ends Its Six-YearDry Spell

.By CATHERINE KIRSCH

Nine bars, 28 fast-food restau-
rants, five pizza shops, four ice-
cream parlors, six drug stores and
eight convenience stores are housed
in Oakland's business district. Since
I977, however, there hadn’t been a
liquor_store within a one-mile radius
of the Pitt campus — a strange
thing, considering the reputed exces-
sive alcohol consumption of college
students. _

This situation was reversed on
Monday, Oct. 3, with the opening of
a new liquor store in Oakland. The
self-service store is located on
Atwood St. next to the post office.

demand of the surrounding com-
munity may account for the new
location. '

“It simply behooves the area to
have one,” said an assistant supervi-
sor from the real estate division of
the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board (PLCB). “The new state store
will certainly be welcomed by the
local populace.”

The closing of the last state store
in Oakland most likely occurred in
response to asudden rental increase
deemed unjustifiable by the state,
according to the official.

There is a consensus among local
law enforcement officials that the
increased accessibility to alcohol
will not give rise to significant
changes in its use.

The LCB foresees no resultant

problems in enforcement of state
liquor regulations due to the store’s
proximity to the Pitt campus. '

“No difficulties have arisen on
other college campuses, such as
Slippery Rock, Grove City and
Westminster, where state stores are
located," the LCB employee
observed.

Pitt’s director of the office of resi-
dential life, JoAnn Woodson-, specu-
lates that the impact of the store on
the alcoholpolicy at Pitt will be min-
imal. Woodson regards the regula-
tory mechanisms of the state, which

function to prohibit the sale of alco- .

holic beverages to residents under
the legal age of2l, as a precaution-
ary measure.

The most frequently’ consumed
alcoholic beverage on the college

  

campus is beer, noted Woodson,
which may be obtained from local
distributors rather than the new
state store. '

Pittsburgh Superintendent of
Police Robert J. Coll cited one pro-
vision: that the state liquor store is
managed within the‘legal limits of
Pennsylvania State laws governing
the minimum drinking age. ‘

The LCB employee noted that
while no organizations have openly,
voiced an opinion in opposition to
the location, neither have any
actively taken part in promoting it.

However, according to the presi-
dent of Oakland Planning and
Development, Sandra Phillips,
although Peoples Oakland was not

instrumental in bringing the state A

store back, they are supportive of it._

Rowdy?

By SCOTT DELLETT

When was the last time
Panther fans tore down the goal-
post at Pitt Stadium?

One would ponder that
thought had he seen the hordes
of WVU faithfully clinging to the
north end zone goalpost afterthe
Mountaineers’ first victory over
Pitt in seven—years. The field
turned into" a sea Qf, confetti as
bodies were swarming over the
artifical turf —— just like their
heroes were a few minutes
earlier. S

Florida State turns into a sea
of _ garnet and gold everytime
56,000 plus jam into Doak
Campbell Stadium on a Satur-
day night. The decibal level
reaches the proportions of a
Who concert when the Seminole
mascot pitches his spear upon
midfield.

Louisana State and Tennessee
constantly make a ruckus every.
time their respective teams
gather to play.

Why is Pitt Stadium,- com-
pared to these schools as quite as
Hillman Library during finals?

There are many theories about
this, some of which will be
explained _later. But fan noise has
become a crucial factor in college
football, as much a part of the
game as the I-formation and the
nickle-five prevent defense.

An example is last weekend's
Pitt-West Virginia game. Near-
ing the end of the first quarter,
Panther quaterback John Con-
gemi was faced with a first-down
situation at the Pitt 27-yard line.
Congemi tried to call an audible
at the line if scrimmage but the
noise generated in Mountaineer
field was so loud that half the
team missed the change. Con-
gemi, as instructed to do in these
cases, asked the official to bring
the noise down to reasonable lev-
els. He refused, simply pointing
his right hand towards the
defense, signaling Congemi to go
on with the play or face a five-
yard penalty.

The result: the Congemi hand-
offto running back Chuck Scales
in muffled, and West Virginia
recovers. Instead of maintaining
a l4-7 lead, the Mountaineers
score a touchdown four plays
later and tie the score.

Complaints about this prob-
lem have been made before by
head coach Foge Fazio, but
seemingly to no avail.

“I think the officials have
taken the game away from the
quaterback," he said during yes-
terday’s press gathering. “He

\should be able to check off plays

at the line. You’ve got to give the
game back to the players.”

“No team should have an
unfair advantage over another
team.” Then he added, in Fazio
fashion,’ “Only if you're playing
away.”

That is where Pitt fans come
into the game. For three of the
first four contests, the youthful
Panther squad had faced a hos-
tile, volatile away crowd, which
is not an enjoyable atmosphere

Scales Gives Pitt Breakaway Threat

By CHARLIE O'HARA

With the Pitt football team having
recovered from the West Virginia
defeat on Saturday, much of the
positive discussion that has taken
place in the Panthers’ circles has sur-
rounded the offense’s newly disco-
vered break-away running threat —
freshman tailback Chuck Scales.

“We’ve been looking for a real
break away threat, a guy who can go
for the seventy yard run,” running
back coach Andy Urbanic said.
“Chuckie has the chance to be that
threat.”

He was just that to the Mountai-
neers for most of Saturday's dog-
fight. The attention was
compounded as Scales broke open
for a 21-yard TD run, reminiscent to
many Pitt fans of the Tony Dorsett
days. ‘

“[Starting fullback] Marlon
Mclntyre blocked his man way out-
side,” Scales said. “Then I cut out-
side because I knew I had my
receivers. coming downfield to
block. After that, it wasjust a race to
the end zone.

“It was very exciting for me. Not
so much because I scored my first
touchdown, but because it was a
touchdown that put us ahead. The
next time I got the ball I fumbled;
those things happen. They make you

concentrate that much harder the.

next time you lineup whether it be
for a blocking assignment, a running
assignment or pass route.” _

With the raw speed displayed on
the Scales dash, one gets the impres-
sion there will be quite a few more
races to the endzone’ before his four
years draw to a close.

“We think he possesses great
speed, obviously a very important
ingredient to a running back,”
Urbanic said. “He’s also very intelli-
gent. His weakness is probably his
strength. He has never been on a
serious weight training program.

“When the season___ is over we'll
have plenty of time to work on
building him up.”

The reason, or at least a great deal
of it, for Scales having no real weight
training, would be that much of his
time at Shadyside Academy, where
he attended high school and played
football in addition to running
track, was spent on the books.

“The biggest transition incoming
to Pitt for me has been the football
transition," Scales said. “Academi-
cally I haven’t had to make much of
an adjustment. It has been very sim-
ilar to what I had in high school.

“Shadyside Academy prepares
you quite well for collegiate work,

because we had the same type setup _

there -— four or five classes a day,
with the majority of the work done
out of class."

Scales, whose undergraduate
major is physical therapy with inten-
tions of someday attending medical
school at Pitt, was able to handle
both the classwork and athletic’
activity admirably in high school,
and was awarded the Shadyside
Academy Scholar/Athlete of the
Year, by virtue of his 3.3 Quality
Point Average (QPA) in the class-
room and gaining Parade All-
America and All-State honors on
the gridiron.

“Competition was tough in high
school, though we were a Class AA
school,” Scales said. “But you can’t

Lady Spikers Search For Top 20

By MARK A.) SINDLER

Around the turn_of the year Pitt-=

women’s volleyball coach Shelton
Collier had his‘ team, or at least a
majority of it, running drills on a
fairly consistent basis. '

A losing effort in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament farbehind
and the 1983 season still far in the
distance, there wasthe hard core ofa
squad hitting the floor, hitting the
ball and verbally hitting each other
as if all were in the midst of a
pressure-cooker schedule.

Considering the season, that is
nothing unordinary. Most top level
programs across the nation practice
on a nearly year-round basis, if not
for consistency, at least to keep the

_ I'i.lSt away.

Collier carriedsimilar intentions,
but t_here was a hitch. Last season,

nation’s Top 20 once, scratching the

bottom of the well at 17th. For one
week the taste was, oh, so fleeting.

That taste, though, seemed glued
to the roof of Collier’s mouth. It
lingered during the off-season, and
became reinforced during training
camp and has slowly become as
forceful as Texas-style chili sauce.

Now, three days before a tourna-
ment against the sixth-, seventh- and
eighth-ranked teams in the country,
Collier’s saving for Top 20 affilia-
tion nears the effect produced by
red-hot peppers.

The Lady Panthers travel to the
Indiana .his weekend to play in the
Purdue Classic against the Lady
Boilermakers (8th), Nebraska (7th)
and Kentucky (6th). ‘ ‘

‘It could the Lilluputians facing
Gulliver. Pitt, heavy underdogs, are

kend of their schedule. Currently,
they are riding a five-tournament
win streak. That, with money in the
bank, will be broken come Saturday
night. i ’

But enough of the betting factor

involved. Collier unquestionably
does not see the ensuing Classic as
life or death. '
. “What I consider the biggest wee-
kend is the first round of the NCAA
Tournament,” he said earlier.
“Secondly, the Big East tournament.
That’s what we have to do to get
there.

“lt’s a no-lose situation this wee-

kend. If we lose, it’s acceptable; no -

greatideal of pressure. It won’t be a
big trauma for us. Losing the. Big
East or NCAA would be a big
trauma.”

‘ Collier will not need an intensive

the thought does sound fathomable,

The Gullivers which Pitt will be
up against are towers among the
country’s skyscrapers.
the favorite going in at 23-2, has lost
twice to UCLA, one of the matches
going to five games (the last of which
was won I5-13). ’

Already, the Lady Wildcats have
downed Pacific, and have beaten
Arizona State and San Diego State
twice each at home, and coaches
Marilyn McReavy and Mary Jo
Peppler claim this is a transition
year for them. ‘

Nebraska, at l5-l, came out tops
at a San Diego State tournament
two weeks ago and is coming off an
82 season in which it was tied for
ninth in the country.

It is easy to see that making the

[post-season tournament is '-one ,.

Do not let the number on herjer-
sey fool you; the big, blue “2"spread
across the_back of Sally Gillespie’s
uniform is more indicative of her
academic class (this is the sopho-
more outside-hitter's second year at
Pitt) than of her standing in the
ranks of defensive players. Accord-
ing to Pitt women's volleyball coach
Shelton Collier, the 5-4 back-court
specialist is No.l.

“Last season, Sally started 10 of
i2 matches at the Big East Confer-
ence Championships and was
considered the best'defensive player
in the conference," Collier said.

Gil1espie’s value gets a consider-
able boost from her adaptability -
being able to play several different
position effectively. Said" Collier,
“It's been interesting for Sally. She

team, but her- primary role is as a
back-court —'— or, I should say a def-
ensive specialist.”

“Defensive sparkplug" is a term
Collier has used to describe the Nor-
win High School graduate, but Gil-
lespie is always ready to assume the
role of setter should the need arise.

“I expected to be mostly a defen-
sive player, but I would set attimes if
I were needed in different situation,"
Gillespie explained. “it wasn’t like
Shelton said, ‘No, you won't set,~’; l
would set if we got into trouble."

The team got into very deep trou-
ble when junior setter Cathy Rupp
hurt her ankle three weekends ago at
the Pitt Classic. The other halfofthe
setting duo (in Collier‘s 6-2, there are
two setters and six potential spik-
ers), team captain Judy Young, had
been favoring an ankle injury. To
give his regular setters a rest, Collier
turned to adaptable and dependable
Gilles ie.

“Sally stepped into the setting
position and handled that extremely

. well,” Collier said. “That’s one ofthe

great things about Sal -— she’s adap-

table to these roles, depending on‘

the situation.”

This trouble-shooting rvarkplug
is aproduct ofthe Norwin volleyball
machine, a transmission constantly
tuned by Sheron Watson, that has
collected eight consecutive state
class AAA volleyball champion-
ships and produces quality athletes
like Gillespie and freshman team-
mate Kris Wexell. Although she
graduated a year earlier than Wex-
ell, Gillespie also had a 74-1 record
there. —

Collier calls Watson “one of the
finest highschool coaches in the
country, largely responsible for
developing the qualities in Sally and
Kris that have made them top-notch
collegiate volleyball players.”

As a Norwin Lady Knight, Gilles-

pie was the setter and team captain '

her senior year andwas selected for
the Pittsburgh-based Mideast-
Rivers Junior Olympic team in 1981,
leading the team to a third-place fin-
ish at the National AAU Junior
Olvmnic tournament. '

Gillespie thus has a solid back-
ground as a setter, but she empha-
sizes her defensive skills.

“Right now l’ve been setting, but 1
usually just play defense,” Gillespie
remarked. “l pretty much do what-
ever he [Collier] says. A lot oftimes,

compare it to this level. The mental
preparation is so much greater than
it everwas in high school."

Scales, whose father Charley
played with the Steelers (1960-61)
and Cleveland Browns \(l962-65),
attributes his choosing Pitt to its
team togetherness and success over
the years.

“The Pitt team stickstogether as a
unit,” he ‘said. “I think I chose Pitt
because it doesn’t stress individual—
ism. l’mjust another guywho is out
to give lOO% every day.

‘‘I believe this year’s team has the
potential to go very far. Though we
lost two h'ard~fought games to a
tough Maryland team and an arch
rival West Virginia team, there are
losses. We have to work harder, but
we have the potential. .

“The program, in my opinion, is

E OCTO
  REN

going nowhere but up. Pitt has
always been one ofthe top programs
in the country and I think for the
next four years that it will continue.”

Although Scales has stepped to

.the forefront as tailback with his

performance on Saturday, Pitt head
coach Foge Fazio is waiting until’
this afternoon to announce whether
senior Joe McCall or the freshman
will start in the spot that, for the last
three weeks, had. been sophomore
Darnell Stone’s before he broke his
wrist on Saturday.

Scales should get the start.
McCall, despite a pulled calf muscle
that kept him out the last three
weeks, has yet to show any signs of
consistency. .

Even if Scales is not given the nod,
Fazio has definite plans to utilize the
youngster against Florida State.

" “You’ll see Chuckie Scales a heck-

 

banged up pretty good in our presea-
son training" camp, and it took him

this long to get healthy. But we were  I: _
saying right along that} he had tref, V .
mendous speed and talent. You’ll see  V ft

him quite a bit."

Scales had a slight separation of‘ ii "T
his left shoulder on the last day of -'

practice at training camp, but the

camp was plenty of time for Scales‘ . . ‘

to show his wares.

Following one of the scrimm-ages‘

at the camp, Fazio marvellediover
his capabilities. ' '

“Did you see Scales on that end ~
sweep to the left? He turned a three-.3

yard loss into a three-yard gain! We

haven't had anybody here who could‘ i I

do that since Tony Dorsett.”

.sure shots to make it is quite

another. The Lady Panthers have ~
that chance this weekend.
Predicting their ﬁnishes is debata-
ble only because teams in the past,
similar to this year’s components,
have swatted away the nation’s elite
in standout matches. If Pitt goes 0-3
in the Purdue Classic, no one is to
say that they definitely will not be an
outside favorite come December.
However, if the team cannot
prove that it has the stuff to strut,

M" , \ N

then there is no*reason to believe it
can do so in the NCAA elimimation
rounds. Forget winning the Big
East. At the expense of taking
breathable air for granted, Pitt is
1983's shoo-in for the conference
title, carrying with it an automatic
bid to the national tournament.
Making the tourney is not the
crap shoot. Coming out with victo-
ries against the teams to be faced in
the postseason presents the gamble.
With a new playoff structure imple-
mented earlier in the year, Pitt‘s foes
in the first round are likely to be

WVU  
Boots
Pitt

By MIKE SIBERINI

Shortly after the 60,000 West Vir-
ginia football fans left the Coliseum
in Morgantown on Saturday, the
Panthers and the Mountaineers
took the field again. This time, how-
ever, it was the soccer teams that did
battle, and the hometowners came
out on top, 2-1 in overtime.

Pitt (4-5)jumped out to a 1-0 first-
half lead on Bob Howard's third
goal in the last two games. The fresh-
man forward got the ball and moved
to his left. Once he got a half-step on
the Mountaineer defender, he hit a
left-footed shot from 10 yards out.

“I think he's adjusting to,college-
level soccer,” Coach Leo Bemis said
of Howard. “He’s a scrapper, and
he’s coming along with more playing
time.” A

West Virginia made the game 1-1
10 minutes into the second half. The
score remained tied until the second
minute of the first l0-minute over-
time. The Mountaineers then held
the Panthers in check for the next 18
minutes of extra time, making that
goal the game-winner. .

“In the first half, we played ou
best game all year. We made good

, transitions from defense to offense,”

said sophomore defender Brian
Casey. “In the second half, we came
out in too much of a defensive posi-
tion, just trying to protect our lead.
We didn’t play poorly in the second
half, just bad enough to let them
win.”

“It was probably our best overall
team effort on the field, at least
against top-flight competition,”
Bemis said. “Now if we can sustain
the effort and intensity from the
West Virginia game, there is hope
for the future.”

The future is today for the Panth-
ers as they host Bethany in a West
Penn Conference game at Pitt Sta-
dium at 7:15 p.m.

Specialty

it’s his confidence. in me that helps

me play better.”

This weekend, the Lady Panthers
travel to the Purdue Classic to take
on nationally-ranked teams Purdue
(3), Kentucky (5) and Tennessee (7).
“It’s hard to say what l’ll,be doing,"
she said. “Everyone’s just getting
readjusted to Cathy and Judy, who
are getting back into the flow of
things. You just do what you have

to.”

Collier noted the positive effects

Gillespie has on the team.

“When Sal’s in the lineup, every
player seems to perform better, and
that’s evidence of the positive effect '
and motivation Sally has on our

team.”

. Gillespie emphasized player-to-
player cooperation and encourage-
ment and maintained that these are
the keys to the team’s ability to over-

come other high-caliber teams.

Gillespie said, “We allrely on each
other for confidence. If we have to,
P we pull each other’s weight- We’re a
pretty determined team and usually
we’re the underdog, so we have to

fight ‘for every point."

Why has the 5-4 sophomore
defender been so successful in her
specialization? Collier attributes
that success to Gillespie’s distinctive
intense

ability to maintain
concentration.

“The No. I variable that makes
Sal so special is her ability to sustain
an extremely high level of concen-
tration for prolonged periods of
time,” the fourth-year coach said.
“She does this far better than any

player l’ve ever coached at Pitt.”

When she’s not concentrating on
defeating the opposition, Gillespie
can be found concentrating on
maintaining a 3.0 QPA. So far, the
adaptable spiker is undecided about
pursuing the biology major she had
been considering, but she has-not
into trouble dividing time
between the court and the books.

“Well, not yet, anyway,” she said

run

with a_ laugh.

When asked about the impressive
record, 19-2, the squad has com-
“we

piled, Gillespie responded,

work hard at it. I’d say it was our
determination. We get thejob done,
even if it’s not really expected of us.”

Lady Panthers Spins Past Dukes    

The 4-2 Lady Panther tennis

‘team defeated crosstown rival

Duquesne to win its second con-
secutive match Monday. The 7-2
win, coupled with earlier tri-
umphs over Robert Morris and
Carnegie-Mellon, gives Pitt the
unofficial bragging rights of
women's collegiate tennis in the
city. V

“The team’s performing well,"
Coach George Dieffenbach said.
“I hope we can keep up the win-
nin_g way.”

“It was a good win,"Aadded
Miriam Goltz, the team’s singles

player. “You always get up for S

the matches that are in your
backyard. If you can pull them
out, it's always a good win.”

Pitt got wins in the singles
draw from No. 2 Jodi Levine (6-
1, 6-1 over Mary Beth Kerr), No.
3 Kris Peckman (6-0, 6-0 over
Jennifer Tobin), No. 4 Jody
Mattioli (6-1, 6-2 over Maureen

McKenna) and No. 5 Jenny
Leach (6-2, 6-0 over Maureen
Michaels).

The lady Panthers swept the '

doubles competitionas the teams

of ’Goltz/ Levine, Mattioli/ Le- '

vine and Rhonda Gibbs/ Leach
all won with relative ease.

The only losses of the day
came as Duchesses Vivian Pain-
sino defeated Goltz 7-6, 6-4 in the
top singles match and Lauren

Mansotti tested Gibbs 1-6, ‘6-4,
6-4 at No. 4.

Tuesday's .scheduled match

against Slippery Rock was post-_

poned and cancelled due to

weather. The Lady Panthers will

, next face Allegheny College in an‘
away match today before hosting
Indiana University of Pennsylva-
nia Friday evening.

Government Rela-I

tions Committee
—Dan Vuic

The Governmental Rela-

tions Committee (GRC) acts-

as a liaison between Pitt stu-
dents and government offi-
cials at the local, state and
national level. They also
inform students of legislation
which could directly affect
their lives as college students.

The only way for students
to be represented in govern-
ment is to get directly
involved with government.
This is exactly what GRC
does. Last year they were
cosponsors on a tuition
freeze resolution which went
before the _board of trustes
here at Pitt. They also lobbied
in Harrisburg for increased

 

—Pat G uardino

Welcome to our new “Spo-
tlight” column. In each issue,
we’ will focus on a person or
committee who is an intergral
part of student government.

Appropriately, first spo-

tlight is on Carla Bailey, the

woman behind the scenes,
the student government
secretary.

"Carla is 22 years old, and
she has been workng at Pitt
for almost two years. Before
coming to the university, she
worked for the Willie Stargell
Foundation, which is dedi-
cated to fighting scikle cell
anemia.

When Carla first came to
Pitt, she worked in the stu-
dent activities office. This
made the transition to stu-

.. dent government easier for

her since she dealt with the
board through student activi-
ties. Also, the previous secre-
tary, Carol Morris, met with
Carla several days a_week to

...,.,r.,..,.,.,_..

Th: Pitt Nw, Wednesday, October 5, 1903 ,

appropriations for Pitt. With
the help of their lobbying
efforts, Pitt received a two
percent increase in appro-

priations The committee
also coordinates similar polit-
ical functions with other
schools all over the country.

For example, GRC cospon-

sored a bus trip to Washing-
ton DC for National Student
Action Day. On this day, sev-
eral colleges, including Pitt,
sent representatives to lobby
for increased appropriations
for student aid programs.
Although their lobbying
efforts help to an extent, they
cannot do everything on their
own. That is why GRC is cur-
rently in the midst of thier
annual Voter Registration
Drive. -
According to Connie
Kreischer, committee chair-
person, the drive is one of the
major functions, if not the
most important sponsored

by GRC.

ll . .<‘\\‘Spotlight  

Carla said she finds her job
“hectic and busier than I
thought, but I really enjoy it.”
She said it’s more relaxing
because she has more
independence.

Hiring this term’s work

0 study students as very excit-

ing. Carla said she “never had
the opportunity to hire
anyone.” She interviewed
between 20 and 25 students
and hired two.

Carla enjoys her work so
much that she stays on to
help even when she doesn’t
have to. During the student
activities fair in August, she

helped board members blow ‘

up ballons, and she came in
on a Sunday to help Mindy
Goldberg with her first LSAT
Review session.

Carla is always looking for
ways to improve her work
habits, and she hopes to
bring in new ideas to student
government. She wants “to
see that student government
is run as professionally as
possible.”

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

That Time Of Year
-Darci O’Hare

“It is really important that .

students vote because that’s
the only way we (students)
can inﬂuence our legistla—
tors,” said Kreischer. “Not
enough students vote, and
that’s to bad.”

- According to Kreischer
there is not a very good
representation of students at
the polls. The main objective
of the drive is to make stu-

. dents aware of the issues at

hand, in turn creating a better
turnout at the polls.

In the near future, GRC
plans a trip to Harrisburg and
Washington, DC to lobby for
greater support of higher
education in general.

Kreischer welcomes
anyone interested in govern-
ment to attend the commit-
tee meetings. The Govern-
ment Relations Committee
meets in 638 William Pitt
Union on‘ Thursdays at 4:00
pm. Anyone attending two
consecutive meetings
becomes a voting member.
