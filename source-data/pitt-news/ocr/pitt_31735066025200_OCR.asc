Gottfried earned top wages at Pitt in 1991

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

Former Pitt football head coach Mike
Gottfried was the big wage earner at Pitt
last year with a salary of $446,621.

The salary, which is part of the $1
million buyout of Gottfried’s lifetime
contract, was disclosed Wednesday in
Pitt’s Internal Revenue Service forms, which
require that top salaries are listed.

Another top salary in 1991 was that of

TAs complain
of overwork

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

Many teaching assistants feel they are
overworked, according to surveys
proctored by the Graduate and Professional
Students Association.

According to GPSA President Steve Park,
TA’s complaints on the survey ranged

from not graduating on time to having to:

pick up the professor’s laundry to being
lent out as a slave to run errands for
another professor to being treated as a
brainless gopher.

The survey was taken at the request of
the Faculty Assembly, according to GSPA
Business Manager David Fitz. Questions
on the survey ranged from, “Is the work
load allowing you to progress ‘satisfactorily’
according to your department guidelines?”
to “What concerns about T A/TF’s need to
be broughtup that a simple ‘hour counting’
will not allow?”

Parks said that although the Faculty
Assembly previously found that most
fellows are working 20 hours a week, it is
rumored that many are working much
longer hours without reporting them. The
principle response to the survey was that
TA’s were working more than the 20 hours
a week that the Faculty Assembly found.

Parks said that TA’s are trying to get their
degrees along with doing paper work,
class preparation, taking two or three
courses and working those extra hours of
teaching. He said that the university should
treat graduate students as professional
students instead of professional teachers.

According to Parks, the workload conﬂict
is almost an undergraduate issue. TA’s are
pressed to get the teaching and their own
classwork done, which could cause
undergraduate classes to suffer.

Parks said that T A’s cannot complain or
they will end up teaching the worst class
in the department during the next term.

Many of the TA’s are not graduating on
time and their funding is running out,
Parks said. Through the survey, GSPA is
hoping to better the conditions of the
graduate students so they will be able to
graduate on time without their teaching or
grades deteriorating, he said.

“The survey was also designed to get
the ear of the graduate students that GPSA
exists,” Parks said. “The GSPA is finally
trying to fill a vacuum. There is no strong
active voice for graduate students. [They]
do not get the attention they deserve.”

Medical Center Thomas Detre, who
garnered $361,400 with an expense account
of $28,915. Former Pitt President Wesley
Posvar earned $300,192, despite
information disclosed this summer that
indicated earnings of $285,000 in his final
year. Vice President of Health Sciences/

Vice President of Pitt Medical Centerjeffrey ‘

Romoff was paid $280,600.

Two members of Pitt’s medical center
who are not university officials but
departmental chairs also earned over
$200,000. John Mulvihill, chair of the human
genetics department, earned $262,600 and

Brian Jegasothy, chair of the dermatology
department, earned $222,493.

Professor of otolaryngology Charles
Bluestone earned $264, 375 and assistant
professor of surgery Robert Korrnos earned
$220,600.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor
currently earns $200,000 a year.

“We’ve been doing this [disclosure] now
for three years and it’s pretty routine,‘
university spokesperson Mary Ann Aug
said. ‘

Under state law the university is required
to allow inspection of names and salaries

of officers, directors and the five highest-
paid employees and five highest-paid
service providers. In addition, Pitt must
maintain an administrative office where

people can inspect such a document during .

regular business hours.

But the university is not required to
publicly announce the availability of the
document, nor to post or provide copies
of the document.

Tip O’Neill was speaker of the house for
nine years — longer than any other speaker
in the history of the United States House of
Representatives.

' "The Massachusetts “bread and butter
liberal,” as he calls himself, was the first
American to meet Mikhail Gorbachev. His
autobiography, the history of his 56 years in
politics, was a New York Times bestseller.

But last night Tip O’Neill urged a crowded
audience at the William Pitt Union to forget

the past and looktoward the future to solve '

the nation’s economic turmoil and revitalize
the future of America.

“The days of the New Deal are behind
us,” O’Neill said. “We are now in the period
of back—to-basics '90s — a period of solid

O’Neill: U.S. must look to future

“We are facing one of the world’s worst
recessions. Millions have no jobs, no‘ chance
of achieving the American dream," O’Neill
said. “Education is backsliding; the family is
eroding and it is increasingly hard to be
upbeat.”

People have forgotten that their welfare
depends on the welfare of others, O’Neill
said. “But the promise of America is still
there," he added. “We just have to bring it
along.”

O’Neill gave his own opinion about
bringing it along: making use of the freedom
of speech, a freedom too many Americans
take for granted, he said.

“Public officials have the right to take it,"
he said, “and now that I am a private citizen,
I have the right to dish it out."

This “unpredictable” election year, which
began in Pennsylvania with the victory of
Harris Wofford, will be evidence of the
anger in America, O’Neill said. He predicted
that at least 100 seats will be replaced in the

Israeli oﬁicial
berates U.S.
for denying”
guarantees

By Manuel Hernandez
Stajf Writer

Israelis will be forced to share
more of their already limited
resources with incoming Jewish-
Russian immigrants as a result of
the United States denying Israel
loan guarantees, according to
Ehud Olmert, Israel's Minister of
Health.

Olmert said Israel will be forced
to change some of its priorities to
accommodate theunforeseen U.S.
rejection of loan guarantees. He
added that Israel did not want the
U.S. to send money from
taxpayers but wanted the Bush
administration to help Israel find
the funds they needed.

“Israel is a proud country and _

we will do all we can to help the
[Russian] immigrants coming
here," Olmert said.

According to White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
Secretary of State James Baker
offered the Israeli government
several alternatives under which
loan guarantees could be made
available. He added that Israel
rejected these options.

The U.S. proposal called for a
halt on new housing construction
in settlements. The plan would
have allowed for $10 billion in
new loan guarantees.

“The United States has long
supported emigration to Israel,”
Fitzwater said. “The United States
also supports the principle of
absorption assistance. We are still
very much interested in reaching
agreement on the issue of loan
guarantees for Israel."

Olmert also addressed recent
attacks against Israeli institutions
by Palestinian organizations. On
Tuesday, the Israeli embassy in
Buenos Aires, Argentina was

‘bombed. The Argentinian

government reported that 135
people were injured and 11 were

killed. Rescue workers are still

Pharmacy students learn
danger of drug exposure

By Holly Affeltranger
For The Pm News

At Pitt's pharmacy school students not
only learn about the composition of drugs
and their uses, but they also learn about the
potential dangers of being exposed to these
drugs as professional pharmacists.

Pharmacists have a high risk for drug
dependency. The three main reasons are
access to the dru gs, stress from the job and/
or schoolwork and a sense of invincibility to
the drugs being used or abused.

In the pharmacy school there is a class to

speakers who lecture on drug impairment
and even sometimes speak of their own
experiences with drug dependency.

Last fall Rick Koch, a pharmacist who is a

recovering from a drug-dependency problem,
spoke to the class about his experiences. “I
speak about myself and what happened to
me," Koch said

Koch has spoken to Myers’ class several
times in the last three years. He not only
speaks about his own experience, but also
about recovery programs and how they
helped him and many others just like him.

The echoes of the screams of roller-
coaster fanatics and the smell of corn
dogs and french fries lingering in the
air can be a whole summer for college
students at Cedar Point Amusement
Park.

Cedar Point is located on the shores
of Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio, and
according to Personnel Coordinator
Darlene Bland, Cedar Point is recruiting
3,500 college students for this summer.

Pitt wins cultural diversity award

Byjulie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

‘Cited as innovative and
outstanding, Pitt’s “Celebrate
Diversity” program received one
of three national awards that
recognize individual programs
and services that make
extraordinary contributions to
multiculturalism on campus.

“This is something the
university should be proud of,”
said Joe Cavalla, who is director
of student activites and served as
chair of the Cultural Diversity
Committee.

The goal of “Celebrate
Diversity” is to showcase the
university community, its
people and the differences that
make them unique, Cavalla
said.

The program takes place for
three days in September. Events
include multicultural fairs,
educational sessions, music, art
and dance sessions and are open
to all students.

The cultural—diversity program
was developed three years ago
by Pitt’s Office of Student
Activities.

“We took programs other
people have been doing. We

took some existing programs, got I

some new programs and
expanded it into our
cultural—diversity week,” Cavalla
said.

Involving a broader base of
people in the planning and
publicizing more across campus
are two of the main improvements
from last year’s program, Cavalla
said. -

they receive a check for $.35 per hour worked during the
summer.

According to Bland, Cedar Point is basically the only
amusement park that offers housing. It offers dorm-style and
apartment—style housing at low prices.

There are free activities, including after-hour ride nights and
volleyball and basketball games, for employees six nights a
week. Also, employees have free admission to the park, Soak
City and the beach.

“Last year we interviewed 55 students from Pitt. We are
looking to better that number this year,” Bland said. “We are
looking for students who would like to work here, have a good
time and make a lot of money.”

Cedar Point recruits from 55 colleges in Indiana, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, West Virginia and Ohio. ‘

Pitt’s coordinator ofstudent employment, Julia Lard, said not
many amusement parks recruit at Pitt. Other than Cedar Point,’
Kennywood and Idlewild have been the other parks to come
to Pitt seeking summer employees.

“It’s a collective effort from
people across the university,” he
said.

Cavalla attributed the success
of the program to the collective
efforts of New Student Programs,
International Student Services, the
CAS Dean’s Office, Pitt Program
Council, Pitt’s Counseling Center,
B’nai B’rith Hillel, Student Special
Services and the vice chancellor
of student affairs as well as other
groups that have representatives
on the cultural—diversity
committee, which helps plan and
put the week together.

Other schools that received
awards include the University of
Florida and California State

University at Pamona.

Out of the dozens of signs
and posters hanging in Ida
Flynn’s office, the one that best
reflects the sentiments of
computer novices reads: “Hit
any key when ready" and shows
a duck about to smash a
computer keyboard with a giant
hammer.

Flynn, director for the

,undergraduate program in
information science in the
School of Library and
Information Science at Pitt,
joked that when it comes to
computers, anything that can
go wrong will.

A native of Tourin, Italy, Flynn
said her family moved to
Argentina when she was six
years old. At 16, she came to
Long Island, New York, where
she received her undergraduate
degree at Adelphi University in

math with an education
certiﬁcation. She earned her
master’s degree at the Chicago
Institute of Technology and is
now on the last leg of receiving
a doctoral in computer science
at Pitt. She came to Pittsburgh
with her husband in 1974
because of Pitt’s innovative
information science program at
the time.

Flynn described information
science as “a lot of things to a lot
of people. We teach students to
work with the computer, but it's
not like computer science. Once
we have the programs and once
we have the computer, the
question becomes ‘how can we
best utilize it to satisfy the needs
of someone who doesn't know
anything about computers’. We
try to be the ‘in-between’ people
to users and to the technical
people.”

“If you like to work with
people and if you like to work

with detail in a problem, you
are suited for an information
science background," Flynn
said.

The types of jobs that
graduates of the program can
expect to get vary from
telecommunications to
consulting. She said one of the
major improvements in Pitt’s
information science program is
the telecommunications

master’s degree that is now.

THE PIT!’ NEWS, Thursday,  19, 1.992

A Flynn bridges gap, between user and computer

tnany places," she said.

Since there are only about
100 information science majors
at Pitt, Flynn said the university
sometimes forgets about the
department. “I don’t think the
university knows we exist,” she
said.

She said this view may stem

from the fact that, although
Flynn’s department deals in
computers, it has no direct
influence on purchasing new
computers.
’ Any new computer
equipment, including PittcatPlus
at Hillman Library, comes from
the Computing Information
Services.

Despite the innovative
computer work Flynn does as
part of her job, she said the
most rewarding aspect of her
job comes when, “my students
come back and tell me ‘The
course I took really helped me
with my job.”’

Time tight

for Voter
registration

By Katie Kaminski
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Pennsylvania primary
election is coming up, and time is
running out for voter registration.

To be eligible to vote in the
April 28 primary election,
Allegheny County residents must
be registered by March 30.

Sally Harvey of the Department

‘ of Elections said voter—registration

forms are available in many
libraries, state liquor stores,
municipal buildings and political-
party headquarters. Forms may
also be filled out in person at the
County Office building.
Registered voters who will be
out of their voting districts may
apply for an absentee ballot,
which permits them to vote by

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 19, 1992

By Scott Nespor
Staff Writer

With 48 years under his belt, Albert
Brice is Pitt’s oldest employee. He started
on April 11, 1944, as a janitor for what is
now the Schenley Quadrangle.

“That was back when the student union
was the Hotel Schenley,” Brice said. “I’ve
seen a whole lot of changes.”

Those changes include the demolition
of Forbes Field for the new Hillman
Library and Forbes Quadrangle. “And
there was nothing up on the Hill until
1963,” Brice said.

The national conference for
Students Against Hunger and
Homelessness will be hosted by
UVA this fall.

Between 500 and 1,000 students
from around the nation will be in
attendance to help the homeless
get out of the hole and still have
their self—esteem.

This is the first time the
conference has been hosted by a
public school and a southern

OSU’s new Greek alcohol
policy was designed to promote
responsible drinking in the Greek
system.

The policy prohibits personal
or chapter funds being pooled
together to purchase bulk
amounts of alcohol for Greek
functions. Guests must bring their
own alcohol, and individuals who
decide to share will assume all
risks.

The policy also prohibits
alcohol-filled containers, such as
kegs, party balls and alcoholic
punches at parties. Not having
these will shift the blame for any
alcohol—related incidents from the
host fraternity or sorority to the
individuals responsible.

The university’s child—care
center, which is to be opened in
the fall Of 1992, may be delayed
if officials cannot raise $100,000
by this summer.

The center has a $2.2 million
construction budget, but it needs
more money to purchase
equipment, furnishings and other
items which are necessary to gain V
a state license.

In addition to the growth of the campus,
Brice has seen a lot of his supervisors
come and go.

Since the beginning of his tenure, Brice
has worked under seven supervisors, but
he said Don Hughes was his favorite.

“He was a beautiful man,” Brice said.
“He treated me like a human. being.”

While working at Pitt, Brice also served
in the U.S. Army Reserves.

When Brice was 18, he landed overseas
in the midst of World War II. He served in
the South Paciﬁc, helping to drop supplies
to troops on the ground. He ﬂew under
Gen. Davies and in the Tuskegee Institute,

a famous African-American pilot unit.

Recently Brice had the opportunity to
see Davies, who spoke at a reunion for the
local veterans. “I really enjoyed seeing
him again. He really is a distinguished
man," he said.

On Dec. 27, 1986, his duty with the
reserves ended. This was the end of 44
years of service, which included calls to Ft.
Lee, Utah, and Germany. His title was
chief material maintenance sergeant.

Brice said he learned a lot from the
Army and made a lot of good friends.

He said he thinks Dr. O’Connor»made a
good decision when he chose to keep

Pitt's Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
program.
“The Army needs a-reliable source for its

commanding officers, and the colleges ﬁll V

this need," Brice said. He also said the
Department of Defense should not change

its current policy of banning bisexuals, ‘‘ ‘ 

gays and lesbians from the armed services.

Brice said he applies a lot of his
experiences from supply management in
the army to his current job here at Pitt. He
is in charge of receiving supplies for the

working around the clock to free 30 people believed to be
trapped in the wreckage. Israel believes the attack was carried
out by a Palestine terrorist group.

“This event proves again the war we have with the Palestinians
and Arabs can’t be resolved by taking political initiative like the

’ U.S. proposes,” Olmert said.

Wednesday morning reports surfaced on CNN that a claim of
responsibility was made for the bombing by the Islamicjihad.
Fitzwater called the actions of the terrorists outrageous.

Olmert is a prominent member in Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir’s cabinet. He serves as Israel’s' Minister of
Health.

Olmert holds a law degree from the Hebrew University and
is a former military correspondent for Israel’s army radio and for
themilitary weekly Bamacbane. He also served as a military
correspondent with general Ariel Sharon’s forces during the
Yom Kippur war in 1973.

Minister Olmert came to Pittsburgh Wednesday to address the
State oflsrael Bonds Organization. While in Pittsburgh, Olmert

toured Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

itself around, Democratic
candidate Bill Clinton will be
elected president in November.

President Bush is in no danger
oflosing to Pat Buchanan, whom
O’Neill said has the “personality
of a rattlesnake,” but he has been
put on the defensive. O’Neill said
Bush “has been indecisive,
inconsistent and in some cases
even unpresidential.”

O’Neill said the president must
realize that the United States can’t
be the world’s military leader
unless it is the world’s economic
leader, and to do that all levels of
society must participate.

“The U.S. needs to learn that it
has to invest in its people more
than it has to borrow from them,”
he said. When O’Neill was

high-school graduates went to
college, and almost nobody had

health care. Now, he said, the
nation is in danger of backsliding,
and domestic issues must be
faced.

Within the Democratic party
itself, O’Neill said, most
candidates have made an honest
effort to address the issues, despite
the the cheap shots.

“Brown’s attack was an utter
disgrace," O’Neill said about
candidate Jerry Brown’s attack
on C1inton’s wife at a recent
debate. “The Democrats are only
eating themselves up.”

Mario Cuomo, the New York
governor who toyed with the
idea of campaigning this year,
would have been the best
Democratic candidate, O’Neill
said, adding that he is certain
Clinton will win the Democratic
nomination. He said, “We could
have done better.”

Leadership and the courage to

straighten out the economy will
be the deciding factor in this
election, O’Neill said.

The election will also produce
the largest change in congress
since 1974, when the public
responded to Watergate by voting
many incumbents out of office.

“Congress has been the
whipping boy of the American
public since the days of Thomas
Paine,” O’Neill said, “but it's been
there for 200 years. We’re the
greatest nation in the world; it
must be doing some good.”

The recent check—bouncings in
the House would have happened
if Republicans had been in the
majority, O’Neill said, in response
to a question by a member of the
College Republicans. '

“And let me tell you this, young
man,” the Democrat said. “Never

. pull the ladder on the guy that’s

coming behind you.”

High cost of health care

Yesterday, as part of an annual disclosure to the Internal
Revenue Service, university officials were required to list
Pitt’s top—paid, high-roller university employees.
Surprisingly, our newly crowned chancellor’s annual
salary of $200,000 pales in comparison to other big money
players.

At the sum of $446,621, former Pitt football head coach
Mike Gottfried garnered a nice bit of pocket change as
part of his contract buy-out. Gottfried was fired at the end
of 1990.

But the real winner is Thomas P. Detre, senior vice
president for health sciences, squeaking by with a cool
$378,000. Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor also falls behind
Charles Bluestone, professor of otolaryngology-($ 264,375);
JohnMulvihill, chair of the human genetics department
($262,600); Brian Jegasothry, chair of the dermatology
department ($222,493); and Robert Kormos, assistant
professor of surgery ($220,600).

But these figures do not include private expense
accounts and ,benefits, which contribute close to an
additional $50,000 annual income supplement for these
men. , . “ 2‘
While medical science is a -valued profession, the
academic pursuits of liberal—studies majors paying ever-
expensive tuition are also valued. _

These salaries reinforce the belief that the university’s
health-science monolith has risen to godhood. While it is
probably -not too uncommon for medical deities to earn
this level of income, a clear message is sent to students:
The university values itsmedical monster mach-ine over
you.

Historic protections

With the memories of the Syria Mosque’s destruction in
mind, yesterday's action by Pittsburgh City Council should
eliminatefears that Pitt or some other nasty developer will
buy up other treasured Oakland landmarks.

On Wednesday, City Council approved a plan to ensure
the core of Oakland is designated a historic district.

Opposition was mounted by the Pittsburgh Roman
Catholic Diocese, the Western Pennsylvania School for
the Blind and a few members of Council, but the historic
vote carfied 6-1 with two abstentions.

Oakland will now be under be under the supervision of
the'Historic Review Commission. Opponents argued the
commission wouldforce costly repairs on the institutions
if it so desired or even interfere with remodeling. I

John Desantis, chair of the Historic Review Commission,
characterized these challenges as overblown, according
to The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

‘Over 10 years ago, a similar attempt was unsuccessful
dueto opposition from the University of Pittsburgh and
The Carnegie. This time around, Pitt and The Carnegie
remained neutral.

Oakland deserves recognition as a historic district. Such
a status would protect Oakland from runaway development
and the spread of more architectural monstrosities.

school in Providence, R.I.

At her ceremony, her father said he felt “stripped
naked, humiliated and the victim of a psychological
beating” when the Baptist minister had the audience
stand for the benediction, involving Jesus Christ.
Weisman complained to the school board and got
no response.

Deborah Weisman, the younger daughter,
graduated from middle school in 1989. Before the
ceremony, her father renewed his complaint, and
the schooloresponded by asking a rabbi to perform
the benediction. Weisman didn't want that either.
He wanted a non-religious graduation ceremony.

The school principle decided to have the rabbi
speak anyway, so Weisman filed a motion for a
restraining order on the rabbi four days before the
ceremony.

Due to the lack of time, the motion was denied
and the ceremony took place with the rabbi.

"In ‘decidir'i’g’- this case, the Supreme Court is
examining the Lemon test, a three-part test laid out
in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) pertaining to church
and state..

The three parts are: first, the statute must have a
secular purpose; second, it’s principle effect must
not advance nor inhibit religion; and third, the
statute must not foster an excessive government
entanglement with religion.

This case has the potential of censoring religious
language. Any type of speech involving the words
“God” or “Amen,” as in the Lee 22. Weisman case,
can be censored from public discourse.

Organized prayer has been banned from public
schools, and a moment of silence has also been
banned, being called hidden or unofficial prayer. If
religious language is banned from the public realm,
then the Pledge of Allegiance may as well go with
it.

‘ And speaking of public religious language, “The
Star—Spang1ed Banner” will then have to be omitted
from baseball games. .

The government is not supposed to show
favoritism to any religion, but if religious speech is
censored the government would in fact be showing
favoritism to atheism.

The question in Lee 1/. Weisman implicates the
First Amendment. Did coercion of religion take
place?

Jay Alan Sekulow, a Washington, D.C., attorney
who has argued church-state cases -before the
Supreme Court, said, “Exposure to speech is not
coercion. You are not forced to participate."

Being forced to attend a ceremony and being

We can not separate our religious
viewpoints from our political ones; they both
inﬂuence and shape the other.

It is unreasonable to look at a society where
family, economy and race all play a part in politics
and then expect religion to be excluded and
confined to the individual.

We act according to what we believe, so it is
impossible to make religion only a part of our

private lives. It cannot be separated to only our ’

thoughts.

It is true that there are many different religions
and they conflict, but the same is true of political
groups.

A Marxist might offend a Democrat, but he isn’t ’

asked to only speak at home. A radical feminist
might offend a group of macho truck drivers, but
their language isn't censored in public. 2

Religion is just as much a part of us as race. They
both shape us as people and affect the decisions we
make in life, which in turn affect our political
decisions. It would be absurd to shape legislation
so that people could only speak the jargon of their
races in the privacy of their own homes, in case
someone might feel left out. The same should be
true of religion.

People who are religious think about what they
do.“Christians think about what God does.

Yet the misconception that all believers in God
are Christians still stands because the media exposes
aberrant Christians, such as dishonored TV
evangelists, fanatic zealots and cultists, as the norm
for Christianity. ' «

The countless other Christians are all stereotyped
because of the impression these people have
made. The generalization is unfair and inaccurate.
We would not make a generalization about all
professors because one professor gave students A's
for sex.

Resistance to Christian inﬂuence has become
extremely overt this past decade, but the resistance
should not become legislation to “justify” the cause.
This becomes political oppression.

Christians have an equal right to have their say in
politics, and this right should not be infringed
upon. All groups are affected by political decisions,
and everyone should have a say in these decisions.

Religion should not be restricted publicly; it

‘should have the right of free expression. This
expression is just that: expression, not coercion. To

Vegetarian diet a good choice

I was very pleased to read the article
(March 3) by Gary Knapcik on
vegetarianism. Mr. Knapcik revealed some

What is so difficult
in doing this?

Many vegetarians, like myself, don’t
want any elaborate “meat substitutes”
because we regard meat-eating as
something which humankind acquired to
substitute for more natural foods.

There is no need for “balanced meals”
as long as the diet as a whole is balanced.

Vegetarian meals do not have to be any
more complicated than non—vegetarian
meals. Simplicity is the essence of a
vegetarian lifestyle. _

Maybe I am not “qualified” to talk about
diet. After all, I’ve only been a vegetarian
for 14 years. I went through engineering
school and graduate school in my native
country and 4 1/2 years of graduate school
in the U.S. without meat. I salute young
people who make .the switch to
vegetarianism.

Slavery not used to judge
In reference to Justin Laing’s column of

 

Philosophy club should not follow ROTC example

25 Feb., I am once again reminded of how
ignorantly people view history, in particular
that of the United States.

He chooses to reject the notion that men
like George Washington were great simply
because of other aspects of their lives (i.e.
slaveholding). But let’s look a little
closer at the facts of Washington’s
time.

For thousands of years prior to the
American revolution, societies held slaves.
Even the Egyptians, who are considered
to be a great culture, held the nation of
Israel as slaves. '

Around the time of Washington, slavery
was beginning to fall out of vogue. Societies
were nurturing and realizing that slavery
was archaic. This move would not be
made in the U.S. until 1865, but nonetheless
it was made.

Why is Washington great? Simply
because he was one of a group of people

’ who worked within the context of his

time to of
change.

Mr.'Laing, do you honestly believe that
slavery would have been abolished in
America if the revolution hadn’t taken
place? A
_ I doubt it. Slavery was the only mass
work force that was affordable in light of
the strains placed on commerce by British
taxation and tariff policies.

The revolution that Washington
campaigned created a state where the
abolishment of slavery,would become
possible down the road. That’s what makes
him great, in spite of his other
characteristics.

reform; there is no question about
it. But now, more than ever, is a
time to proceed with caution — a
time (if I may) to be prudent — a
time ‘to be decisive. More than
anything else it is a time to think
before acting.

I am not here to bash the liberals
“who want to take all of the
money away from the wealthy,”
nor am I going to bash the
conservatives “who are out of

. touch with reality." All I'm asking

is that you not be hasty but think
about the issues concerned. In
other words, keep in mind that all
of these answers seem, at least for
me, to raise more questions than
they offer solutions.
let me start with the issue
concerning the cutting of defense
spending. There is no doubt that,
with the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the willingness of

Western Europe to take on a
more responsible defense policy,
the defense policies of this country
need restructuring (or dare I say
“cutting”). The world is
undergoing a metamorphosis,
and it is time that we react
accordingly. It is no longer
needed, and we simply can’t

Brett
Gilman

afford it.

However let us think about
what kind of implications, for
example, a 30-percent decrease
by 1997 (as proposed by Gov.
Bill Clinton) could have.

First of all, there are many
regions of this country where
livelihood depends on military
bases.

The military not only provides
employment for military
personnel, but civilians as well. A
decrease in military spending will
literally destroy the towns whose
merchants and citizens depend
upon the money spentby military
personnel for their well—being.
Furthermore, the industries that
supply the military (textiles,
metals, ship building, etc.) will
also be hit extremely hard.

Whether you agree or disagree .

with military spending is
inconsequential. Just remember
that the well-being of many
citizens — not just those in the
armed forces —— rests upon
military spending.
Unemployment will result, and

whole towns will be devastated
by rapid cuts. I argue that one
solution may be to absorb the
subsequent unemployment by
reallocating funds to the building
up of infrastructure.

While not reducing spending,
it will (1) absorb some of the
unemployment and (2) allow us

to realize some immediate results. '

Maybe the government does not
spend its money prudently. That
is not for me to decide. But at a
time when we can ill—afford any
more unemployment, the cutting
of defense spending must be done
so carefully and with full
examination of the facts.
Another serious issue is health
care. It is intolerable that 35 million
Americans have no health care.
The “solutions” offered by the
prospective candidates are, again,
lacking long—term solutions.
One popular suggestion forces
business to provide private
coverage for employees or else
pay a payroll tax to _ cover a
government health-care program.
For one thing, this proposal
falls short because overhead costs

 Presidential election promises, notnecessarily helpful

will increase at a time when
unemployment is high and when
American firms are already having
trouble with their foreign
competitors. The bottom line is
that these increased overhead
costs translate into (1) increased
unemployment and (2) lower
profits for American firms. Again,
this is something that we simply
cannot afford. Secondly, the
government will be forced to
subsidize small and struggling
businesses.

Forcing companies to provide
health-care coverage is most
beneficial for those who are paid
the highest. It limits job mobility
and allows people who “don’t
pay for it” to abuse it. This, my
friends, is unfortunately no
answer, either. I

The other suggestion offers a
national health-care system
similar to that in Canada. Doctors
and hospitals will work privately,
with Americans funding health
care through their taxes. This
means (“read my lips”) — higher
taxes —— something that we know
is despised by everyone. The

government is already out of
control, spending 5 percent of
the gross national product on
government health programs.
The results that will occur from
these “solutions” may be, in the
short term, helpful, but in the

long run they will surely fall

short.

I don’t claim to have any
answers. I do think, though, that
serious reform ‘must be
undertaken. However it must be
done cautiously and with a view
to the long term. Many of the
problems of today are the result
of the irresponsible actions of
previous administrations. We
must be careful not to make the
same mistakes twice. These are
just two issues which fall short of
comprehensive solutions; there
are more. Think about what the
candidates are saying, and then
think about the flip side. The
well—being of this country
depends upon an educated vote.
You can make yourself heard.

McNeal rallies Pitt in 67-65 win

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

There is life after the Big EastTournament for the
Panthers. A rejuvenated Pitt team took over last
night's first—round National Invitational Tournament

5 game in the second half, holding off the Penn State

Nittany Lions for a 67-65 victory. ‘

Chris McNeal's three-point play with 11 seconds
left put Pitt (18-15) over the top. Penn State could
not capitalize on three scoring opportunities as
time ran out. McNeal, who scored 14 of the team's
last 16 points, was the game’s high scorer with 22,
as the Panthers dominated the Lions inside.

First—year player Orlando Antigua added 16
points, and Eric Mobley chipped in 10. Senior Sean
Miller scored just three points but dished out 12
assists and grabbed eight boards. For the Lions (21-
8), DeRon Hayes and Freddie Barnes constituted
much of the offense. Hayes finished with 20 points,
and Brown scored 19.

It was Penn State’s first loss in 15 games at Rec
Hall, and "only its third in the past 43. As a first-
round winner, Pitt will not find out who its next
opponent is until today.

The Panthers overcame hot perimeter shooting
from Penn State by increasing their defensive
intensity in the second half. Pitt trailed going into
the locker room at halftime, 36-32, and stumbled
coming out after intermission. Penn State shot a
blistering 61 percent from the floor in the first half,
mostly on open, mid-range jump shots. The Lions
rolled to an 11-point lead before Pitt came to life.
A Miller three—pointer started the engines, and the
Panthers, using defense which was absent inthe
first half, whittled the lead down to five. Darren
Morningstar, who scored eight points, tied the

Hovan chases national title

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Sports Writer]

He stalks his opposition with
the temperament of a
bloodthirsty predator. His style
could be described as ﬁerce,
ferocious, i_uthless and relentless.

Scott Hovan is a panther in
the truest sense of the word.

Hovan, a senior from
Allentown, Pa., closes out one

- of the ﬁnest wrestling careers in

Pitt history this weekend at the
NCAA Championships. Earlier
this season he became only the
second wrestler in Pitt's history
to reach the 100—win plateau by
recording a 21-8 major decision
over Clemson’s Chris Danegan.
Hovan joined two-time national
champion and four—time All-
American Pat Santoro in the
school record books.

Many expect Hovan to
seriously challenge for the
national title this weekend. His
collegiate mark of 117—34—2 is
only the beginning of his
credentials. Byadvancing to the
Eastern Wrestling League finals
two weeks ago, Hovan became
only the 23rd wrestler in league
history to qualify for nationals
four times.

Following his redshirt season
of 1989-90, Hovan returned to
win the EWL crown at 158 last
season, scoring a 14-5 major
decision over West Virginia's
Dave Onorato. He entered this
season as the favorite at 158,
again earning the top seed.
However, Penn State’s Tim
Wittman upset Hovan 6-4 in

overtime in the finals. Hovan
has said all along that he
planned on peaking — not at
EWL’s, but at nationals.

“When I get to nationals, I
want to know that I'll be ready
physically, mentally and
emotionally to win the national
championship. Obviously, that’s
my goal — that’s what I want,”
he said. “This is my last year
and I just want to do the best I
can when I'm there. That way
when it's all over, whether I
took first or third, I can be at
peace with myself and not have
any regrets.” '-

“That's for Scotty to decide,”
Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “He has all the
tools — physical tools, mental
tools. He certainly could be a
big factor at the national
championships.”

Hovan’s wrestling career
started in the Mountainville Little

League back in fourth grade. '

His father persuaded him to
continue, and after Hovan tasted
the success of a second place
finish in a Mountainville
tournament, everything clicked.
He wrestled at South Mountain

Junior High and developed his

skills through summer camps
and tournaments.

“I really owe everything that
I've done to my parents,” Hovan
said. “A kid that’s 12, 13 or 14
years old isn't gonna get up and
go to a camp on his own.
Sometimes it was difficult as a
kid, because of all the sacriﬁces. "

Hovan became a two-time

state champion at Allentown‘

William Allen High School,
while compiling a record of
116-10-2. He said lifting weights
with his older brother Mark was
the most important step in
accelerating his high school
development. They lifted
religiously everyday at Eskimo’s
Gym in Allentown, a place
where Hovan still works out
during the summer; The owner,
Eskimo, left a lasting imprint on
‘Hovan. ' ‘ ‘ '
“He’s been an excellent
motivator for me. He knows
what it takes to win and he put
me on a great strength training
program,” Hovan said. “He

would make an excellent_

general. He could take a bunch
of guys with trash cans and
sticks and send them off to war
and motivate them to win. He's
made the sport enjoyable for
me and added a new dimension
to my attitude.”

Hovan’s first season at Pitt
produced a mark of 28-14-1. He
broke the 30-win plateau his
sophomore year, going 31-11-
1. As a junior he took major
strides towards the national title,
finishing 31-5, and placing sixth
at the national tournament in

Iowa. Hovan’s bid for the crown-

was halted by two-time national
champion Pat Smith of

Oklahoma State, in a 5-4’

decision that was decided on
riding time.

This year Hovan has been a
mainstay among the top five
wrestlers in the nation. His 27-
4 slate should merit a probable

Jackson said.

The state of Florida proved to be more than
fun and sun for the University of Pittsburgh-
baseball team as it finished with a 10-3 record
during its week-long trip.

Not only did the wins prove valuable to Pitt,
but head coach Mark Jackson got what he
wanted most — a chance to play a lot of games.
“We got to see a lot of different people play,”

Although the team averaged nearly eight runs
a game, Jackson felt the team did not bat as well
as it could have. “When you play as many games
as we did, the players get tired and their bat
speed slows down, which effects their hitting,” .

Jackson said the team drew a lot of walks,
which helped score most of the runs. “Offensively
I feel we can hit better, and I know we will hit
a lot better up north,” he said.

Pitching, which was lacking last season,
performed really well in Florida. The team gave
up about ﬁve runs a game, including two
shutouts against New Hampshire U. and Wagner
College. “The pitchers overall did very well,”

Jackson said the team played fine defensively,
but it could play better. -

Women’s track sets
new school marks

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

The women's track team shone
at its final indoor meet of the
season, the ECAC Championships
held at Syracuse University March
6-8.

‘ Head coach Steve Lewis was
“extremely pleased” with his team
and called it “one of the most
rewarding teams I've ever had.”

Ronise Crumpler and Carmela
Mariani each grabbed a third-
place finish at the meet. Crumpler
ran the 400 meters in 54.86
seconds, barely missing qualifying
for the NCAA Championships.
After all the times were compiled,
Crumpler was 20th in the nation,
and only 16 competitors run in
the 400 at nationals.

Mariani set a school record in
the 5000 meters, finishing in
16:57.03. Fellow distance runner
Laura O'Donnell also broke a
school mark in the 3000 meters.
O'Donnell placedfourth with a
time of 9:41.34.

The mile—relay team of

Crumpler, Kim Blair, Monica
Hockaday and Katina Miles
recorded an NCAA Provisional
Qualifying time but also just
missed nationals. The NCAA
Championships take the top 10
mile-relay teams, and Pitt's time
of 3:43.15 was 18th overall,
Other individuals placing at
the meet included first-year
sprinter Staci Suggs, who grabbed
sixth in the 55-meter hurdles and
Miles, who placed eighth in the
pentathlon. The distance-relay

team of Stacy Wyzykowski,
Hockaday, Judy Facey and
Mariani finished seventh with a
time of 12:22.50.

“Performance-wise, effort-wise,
the whole team really did a great
job," Lewis said. “With some of
the hardships this team has been
through this season, it was very
pleasing.”

Several team members
competed at Syracuse but did not
place, including Stacey Roth in
the 20—pound weight throw, Blair
in the 200 meters and “Renee
Pope in the 55—meter dash. The
4x800 relay team of Facey, Lakeya
Smith, Sidney Cooper and
Wyzykowski also competed.

Lewis’ team now turns to
prepare for the outdoor season,
which begins this weekend with
the Jamaica National Relays in
Kingston,Jamaica. The following
weekend, the team willcompete
at the Panther Relays, the first
home meet this season. Last year
was a banner outdoor season for
the women, as they set 11 school
records. Several team members
are also defending Big East
champions, including Kim Blair,
who placed first in the 400-meter
hurdles last year. ,

The outdoor season runs until
May 28, and the Big East Outdoor
Track Championships will be held
at Villanova. The ECAC
Championships will take place
May 22-24 at George Mason
University.

“After this performance, we're
getting ready for a big outdoor
season,” Lewis said.

Injury-prone Women gymnasts fare Well over break

Hey, I’ve been gone for a while,
but this madness in March has
brought me out of hiding. A lot of
teams, are grumbling about not
having a date at the dance, but
the NCAA selection committee’s
only real madness was the
rejection of Wisconsin-G reen Bay.
The Phoenix won 25 games. It
would have been nice to see
them send home a No. 1 or 2
seed. Realistically, though, they
would be no threat to reach the
Final Four.

UNLV’s Rebels could have
probably run for a while in the
tournament, if they could have
run from the NCAA and courtroom
legalities that will keep them from
competing. See ya’ next year,

In the Midwest I really like

Harold Miner and USC winning
some barnburners against Todd
Day’s Arkansas team and Adonis
Jordan’s Kansas club. Southern
Cal is not overpowering, but with
Miner’s clutch play it should be

able to persevere against the stiff .

competition headed its way.

In the semifinals, a Miner last-
second shot will take the Trojans

remaining.

The Nittany Lions cooled

' off from the floor, hitting only

34.5 percent of their shots
after intermission. The Penn
State outside game, which
was carried by Hayes and
Barnes’, faltered after Hayes
picked up his third foul nearly
halfway through the second
half.

From there Pitt’s intense
defense created several
transition opportunities that
pushed the Panthers ahead.

Pitt was up by one point’

with overa minute remaining
when Ahmad Shareef missed
a breakaway dunk attempt.
The Lions scored to go back
up by one, setting the stage
for McNeaI’s sealing play.

fifth seed at Oklahoma City.
Hovan has racked up a dual-
meet record of 16-1 and again
posted a perfect 7-0, EWL slate.
The only dual-meet loss came at
the hands of Tennessee-
Chattanooga ’s Howard Langford,
the fourth-ranked wrestler at 158.
This was the only pin Hovan
suffered in his collegiate career.

Hovan is still fiery and
enthusiastic, but another season
of maturity has seen him temper
some of the aggression.

“I don’t think my style has been
as aggressive as it was last’year,
but I feel one area I ’ve improved
in is when I get in a close match
— I feel confident," Hovan- said.
“I know a takedown will be there.
I know I can win those one-point
matches.

“When you get to nationals,
you need to feel comfortable in a

% -.

slow-moving, close match
because most of those guys are
as good as you,” he said.

In the past Hovan’s desire to
bury the opposition sometimes
hindered his overall performance.

“My style was pretty much over-
aggressive and if I went out and
wrestled that way I could beat
most of my opponents by a lot of
points," Hovan said.“I feel more
consistent this year. If I see I'm
breaking my opponent, then I’ll
turn it on and try to beat him into
the mat, ” he said. “If my opponent
isn’t gonna open up and is tough
to score on, then I feel comfortable
and relaxed to just wait for that
opportunity to get him out of
position and score points.”

The mounting pressure has
been difficult to live up to but
Hovan said, “I know that if I
wrestle my best I can win the
whole tournament."

I

The 158-pound weight class is
a minefield stacked with
formidable competition. Hovan
will be up against Smith, again
the top seed, as well as Iowa's
second-ranked T om Ryan, who
defeated Hovan earlier this
season.

Hovan has remained relaxed
during the dual-meet season but
anxious to rise to the occasion
one more time. ,

“I don’t think my wins and

losses depend on what my '

competitors do. It all comes down
to howl prepare myself mentally
for each match,” he said. “I don’t
like to lose. I’ll be very happy
with myself if I just go there and

I wrestle to the best of my ability.

If I do that, I’ll be able to live with
myself, knowing that I got beat
by a better guy. I’ll be able to

To the University Community:

The members of Theta Chi Fraternity would like to apologize to the
university community for any repercussions occurring as a result of an
incident at our fraternity house in early February. At a chapter event, guests
at our house were treated improperly and without care resulting in an
altercation between members of our fraternity and a few female guests. As a
result of this incident, a hearing was held before the joint Interfraternity
council and Panhellenic Association Judicial Board, and we were found
responsible for several violations of the Interfraternity Council bylaws.

We were presented with two very serious sanctions. With assistance from
our alumni corporation board, other alumnus members and representatives
from our internationalheadquarters and volunteers from the regional staff of
Theta Chi Fraternity, we prepared and submitted, a series of sanctions which
met with the approval of the IFC and the university. These sanctions
addressed not only the behavior which led to the incident, but also the
overall attitude of our chapter which led to other problems in the past.

Working with the program that was approved, our chapter will undergo a
complete reorganization before the end of the spring term. Following
guidelines utilized by our international headquarters staff in similar situations,
all current members will be suspended and then interviewed, if they so
choose, to be readmitted to Alpha Beta chapter. We anticipate that the
number of the members in the chapter after the reorganization will be greatly  
reduced from the current size. ‘

We will be meeting and working over’ the summer to prepare for fall
semester. In the fall, our reorganized chapter will work to become a viable
part of the University of Pittsburgh‘Greek‘ system and a contributing group in
the university community. a r

  Alpha Beta chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity would like to apologize to the
other fraternities and sororities, to the individuals involved and to the
university community. We will work to redevelop our chapter so that we can
once again play an important and positive role at the University of Pittsburgh.

Sincerely,

The Men of Alpha Beta Chapter
Theta Chi Fraternity
University of Pittsburgh

I dreamed a dream of, y’know,
bein’ a real tough-tough guy,
spinnin’ “Hi-Infide1ity” via REO

runnin’ with the ruff guys” and
eatin’ up every word. Thinkin’,

tougheroonskis of all types avoid
one common thing: shorts. Yes,
shorts. I never saw my dad, Jake,
in shorts. Howzabout Jimmy
Stewart, Jackson Pollack, Lorne
Greene or — hell — Joan
Crawford? Nope.

Yes, these folks in Helmet wear
shorts. Shorts. Sorta the longish,
skater/activewear type accented
with, yew got it, sneakers.
Imagine. Despite this alleged
hubris, by gum, this Helmet gig is
one disciplined bunch of do-
gooders. Discipline is the primary
objective in the ultra-heavy, robo-
rock that Helmet churns out, and,
man, have they got that fish.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 19, 1992

 

Staff Writer

While I was talking on the
phone with guitarist Eugene
Chadbourne on Tuesday, he
paused at one point to turn off a
tape that was playing in the
background.

“Believe it or not," he said, “I'm
dubbing some songs for Jim
Stafford, the country singer. He's
cutting a new album, and some
publisher called me [asking to
hear some songs]. '

“That happens every now and

then. I'll get a call from some

Nashville publisher looking for
songs. Someday one of these
guys is going to record something
lofminel. I haven’t actually gotten
anything accepted yet, but it’s
great just to get these people to
listen to my stuff,” he said.

Hearing that country-music
people are interested in
Chadbourne is something of a
surprise, although it shouldn't
be. Country seems to be one of
his specialties.

_ By Mike Shanley

But then again this is Eugene
Chadbourne, an artist who is on
the fringe of the fringe, light
years from anything close to
accessible. He plays instruments
like the electric rake and the
electric plunger and writes songs
chock full of stinging commentary
on the American right wing.

I guess it’s just more evidence
that you never know what to
expect from Mr. C.

Trying to describe
Chadbourne’s music, one writer
said, “Imagine a world where
Johnny Cash and Phil Ochs meet
head-on with Derek Bailey, and
you’re getting close." Yeah, close,
but no cigar.

Chadbourne’s guitar-playing
represents a musician who has
digested virtually all the important
guitar stylings of the last three
decades and could spit outjimmy
Page and Sonny Sharrockisms in
the same breath.

Chadbourne’s recorded output

called the Chadbourne Baptist
Church, named for an actual
church he saw in a neighboring
town. When he returns to
Pittsburgh next Wednesday, he
will be performing solo.

“I like to play acoustic guitar,”
he said, “and besides, it’s kind of
hard to hear as soon as anybody
else starts playing.”

In addition to playing music,
Chadbourne has also written a
book, Your U.S.A. and My Face,

an autobiography of sorts that-

tells stories about discovering
music and drugs and of being a
draft dodger in Canada. Excerpts
from the book have been
published by a small press at the

of his adventures touring in

Pop’s happy-go-lucky balladeer Adams at Civic Arena

; .—\_ By Brian Gallagher

Staﬁ“ Writer

In the turbulent, ground-
breaking music world of the ’90s
— with genres like rap and heavy
metal grabbing all the headlines
— how does a mainstream rocker
like Bryan Adams continue to do
boffo business at the record store
and box ofﬁce?

With sneaky, manipulative
advertising and million-dollar
videos? No, that’s left for the self-
proclaimed “King of Pop,"
Michael Jackson. How about
hitting up every U.S. city for three
or four concert stops in a one— or
two—year period? Nope, that
category belongs to Michael
“Someone Write Me a Song”
Bolton and Rod “Miller Lite”
Stewart.

N o, nothing calculated like that.

Bryan Adams just makes
infectious, guitar—driven rock
songs and ballads, performing
them with a genuine, happy—go—
lucky enthusiasm that’s often

I missing in today’s studio—
influenced, dance-pop music
scene.

While Adams’ work may never
change the face of pop music, the
32-year-old Huck Finn with a
guitar has found his niche,
providing the music world with
his distinct brand of ridiculously
catchy rock ‘n’ roll for over a
decade.

The Vancouver—based singer/
songwriter brings his “Waking

Thursday

Up The World" tour to Pittsbu rgh's
Civic Arena this Friday. The Storm,
featuring former members of
Journey, will open the show. It
will be Adams’ ﬁrst area show in
five years.

Touring in support of his latest
release, Waking Up The
Neighbours, Adams has survived
in the unpredictable music
industry with a penchant for
creating catchy, anthem—like pop/
rock songs.

His latest 15—track release,
which includes lighthearted,
raucous jaunts like “Touch The
Hand” and “Hey, Honey, I’m
Packin’ You In!, ” recalls the heavy
bass and backbeat sounds Adams
created in his two mid-’80s
breakthrough albums, Cuts Like
A Knife and Reckless.

In his Tuesday night concert at

Cleveland, Adams drew heavily
from Reckless and Neighbours in
a two—hour show brimming with
unpredictable energy and gusto.
Categorized as a pop lightweight
by most critics, Canada's favorite
son has elicited nothing but raves
for his live shows.

For the craggy~faced, blond
balladeer, 199 1 and ’92 have been
big comeback years. Following
the lukewarm public response to
his somber 1987 release, Into The
Fire, Adams left the music
spotlight and spent three and a
half years in the studio recording
a never-released album with U2
producer Steve Lillywhite.

He finished Neighbours with
Def Leppard producer Mutt Lange
in early ’91 and returned with a
bang last summer with his Robin
Hood ballad, “Everything I Do (I

Do It For You)," which became
the second-highest—selling single
of all time (behind “We Are The
World”). The single earned
Adams a Grammy award and an
Oscar nomination. It also enjoyed
more radio airtime than Larry
King and Howard Stern
combined.

While his album and singles
are doing solid business in the
States, Adams has made an even
bigger splash in Europe. Prior to
“Everything1 Do,” his only claim
to fame on the continent was his
“It’s Only Love” duet with Tina
Turner. Since his Robin Hood
ballad, Adams has taken ﬂight.

“Everything” topped the British
charts for a record 16 weeks
(breaking a 34-year record held
by the immortal Slim Whitman).

His album has been in the‘

S-5

European Top 10 since
September.

Adams spent last fall touring
Europe, selling out 38 straight
arena gigs. Following his U.S.
shows, the Canuck will return to
Europe and embark on a stadium
and arena tour, which includes a
stop at Wembley Stadium in
London.

Adams became a U.S. concert
headliner in 1985 with his
“Reckless” tour. The album sold
10 million copies worldwide and
yielded six Top 20 hits, including’
“Run To You,” “One Night Love
Affair” and “Summer of ’69." He
has spent the past six years
exploring different ground --
writing and producing songs for
Bonnie Raitt, Joe Cocker, Roger
Daltry, Tina Turner and Carly
Simon.

“Nod Scene” and “Snake

‘T op Girls ’ explores the trials and woes of the career woman

By Lori M. Bossert
Stajf Writer

What are the sacriﬁces that a
“career woman” of today must
make? What does it take for her to
advance in the male—dominated
business world? Which trade-offs
must she make in life to ensure
her continued success? What
entails a fulﬁlled or wasted life?
Caryl Churchill’s play Top Girls,
performed with energy by the
Point Park College Theater
Company, explores these
questions in a drama which spans
both the past and the present.

Marlene (Michele Schmitt) is a
high-powered businessperson
working her way to the top of the
corporate ladder. The play opens

recent promotion. It’s a party with
a twist — the guests are lesser-
known female historical figures.
Taken from history, literature and
myth, they discuss their various
life histories and problems which
seem to be common to all women.

hold common themes which run
central throughout the play:
marriage, children and male
domination and oppression. They
open up the play’s dialogue on
the timeless problems of women
who break with society’s image
of what a woman should be.

The rest of the play focuses on
the lives of Marlene, her co-
workers and her estranged family.
The problems discussed by the
heroines of Scene I are now
actualized for the women of the
19805. Churchill has captured the
sense of entrapment often felt by
today's women, caught in a
society which alternately
encourages them to succeed and
punishes them for not fulfilling
the traditional female roles of
wife and mother.

This is a play which has the

potential to dazzle or to drag,
depending on the cast. Director
James O. Prescott’s seven
actresses shine as they portray 16
different women in two acts. Their
shifts from character to character
are seamless; it’s sometimes hard
to believe there are only seven
actresses in the company.

In a cast filled with good
performances, Robin Gibson is
unforgettable. Playing the roles
of Dull Gret and Angie, her
presence ﬁlls the stage whenever
she’s on. A superb command of
body language, facial expression
and vocal control combine to
create an incredible performance.
Her work as troubled, pathetic
Angie. is intriguing. She walks a
ﬁne line between reality and
insanity, and one is never certain
when the rope will break.

Equally stellar are Michele
Schmitt (Marlene) and Stacy
Masel, who has three different
roles but is principally noticeable
asJoyce, Marlene’s sister. Schmitt
plays Marlene with drive and
energy, mingling the stresses and
joys of a woman reaching for the
top of the corporate world. Masel
provides an engaging mix of grit
and tenderness as Joyce, Angie’s
mother. The real ﬁreworks for
both actresses come in the ﬁnal
scene of the play, where they try
to ﬁnd a middle ground between
their two very different worlds.

Berta Van Zuiden is also
memorable as Pope Joan and
Louise, Angie’s younger playmate.
Her Louise is completely natural
and childlike, while her Joan’s
sarcastic recounting of her
experiences in the Vatican shows

comic genius. .

Tawnya Hladik, Eva Marie
Piccioni, and Noelle Neal all have
moments which shine in their
various roles, first playing
Marlene’s guests and later her co-
workers. Their energy levels are
high throughout the production,
adding color to even the smallest
roles.

The technical aspects of this
production are top-notch, as well.
Don Difonsio’s costumes are
splendid; he changes each
actress's look completely for her
many different roles. Douglas
Huszti’s set and Deborah
Su11ivan’s lights are well-done
also, ﬂuidly changing to a variety
of locales. ' _

With one quick shot, which

Bill crosses the paranoid'—

agent, Fadela. Joan is his link to
reality, a psychological mooring
that he desperately desires to
cling to. Nowhere is this more
apparent than when he and Joan
improvise on her husband’s
Arabic typewriter, creating a text
neither of them can understand,
paradoxically propelling both into
ecstasy.

One of the saddest elements of
the film is the portrayal of the
shackled mugwumps, secreting
their morphine like ﬂuid for aged
couples who cling to the
mugwumps’ oriﬁces like newborn
children. Here is another fear of
becoming, and a contempt for,
pulp media that the sinister side
of Interzone used to pacify and
control the population like junkie
pimps. .

Bill Lee finally makes his
passage back to Manhattan and
pseudo—sanity. To Hank he warns
of the evil within his own writing.
Hank had always thought that his
own theme, Americana, was too
young and innocent for him to
encounter similar demons, but
Bill warns him:

older than time. You must be
careful.”

Summation; a darn good film.
Beyond the rock—solid
performances of Peter Weller as
young Bill Burroughs, Ian Holm’s
erudite portrayal as the prime
Interzone chump, Roy Scheider’s
refreshing depiction of gangsta’
operative Dr. Benway and Judy
Davis’ personification of any and
all things sensual (not to mention
her expert thespianship), there IS
Ornette Coleman’s composition
and performance of the movie’s
soundtrack, which is another
article all together. Where some
films throw you directly into the
ﬂames, Cronenberg methodically
fries you, slowly cooking you
into every human insecurity and
fear imaginable. I
