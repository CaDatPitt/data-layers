University

By Renee Crespy
For Tbe Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Shop, the
outside vending operation that
had its license revoked by the
city on Sept. 28, is facing another
legal action — this time from the
university.

On Friday Pitt ﬁled charges
against Charles Bonasorte, the
owner, for using the telephone
number 422-PITT, which is
painted on the side of his van.

“They are trying to wear me
down by all of this l...] I use this
number because the first four
letters in my shop are P-I-T-T.”

Tim Ziaukas, director of
communications at Pitt, explained
why Pitt brought charges against
Bonasorte. “We filed suit to stop
him for copyright infringement
for using our trademark in his
phone number. This is not a
small or unimportant
consideration, and our attorneys
tell us that if we don’t protect the
use of our trademark in all cases,
we will lose that trademark
forever,” Ziaukas said.

“The use of the Pitt logo in Mr.
Bonasorte’s phone number might
lead people to believe that the
university is running his business,
which we are not,” said Ziaukas.

New dorm

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
has received three new offers
from developers to build
dormitories on and around the
campus.

“There have been three
developers that have come to
us,” said L. Thomas Hussey,
director of facilities management
services. “But we’re not making
any decisions on them right now.”

Hussey said that these were
realistic proposals. “I feel that
they deserve consideration,” he
said. “But our design proposals
must also be taken into
consideration.”

He said that two of the proposed

Bonasorte and his employees
were petitioning yesterday on
the corner of Forbes Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard.

Bonasorte said that all of his
employees had their licenses
revoked. The employees were
told that their licenses were taken
away because they had not paid
taxes in 1989. ‘

Mary Kay DuBart, one of those
employees, said, “I never even
worked here in 1989, and I don’t
understand what’s going on. I'm
confused and angry. We did
everything legal, and now we’re
getting shut down.”

“They revoked everyone’s
license so no one could run the
shop,” said Bonasorte. “Not one
of those employees worked for
me in 1989, so I don’t know how
they could say they haven’t paid
their taxes.”

In order to close down his
shop, Bonasorte said he must
receive four vending citations, or
one business citation. Bonasorte
has not received one in 1990.

“All I want is due process. They
closed my business without me
ever receiving any citations, and
I wasted no time telling them
that,” he said.

Bonasorte then received a

sites for the new dormitories were
on ground not owned by the
university but would not disclose
more information.

“The president along with the
Board of Trustees will make the
final decision on the proposals,”
Hussey said. “But first the plans
have to go through many
constituencies.”

Last February the university was
considering a plan to build a
dormitory around the Falk School,
but the plan was rejected by the
school. Hussey, in an interview
with The Pittsburgh Press, said
that the Falk School area  is
still an attractive site, and it is the
premier location for new
construction for real estate the
university owns.”

Secona’ student paper
begins publication

By Jenna Ferrara
Staﬂ" Writer

In an attempt to better serve
and represent the diverse Pitt
Community, three Pitt students
are publishing The Dispatch, a
new campus newspaper which
hit the stands last night.

“The Pitt campus is very large
for one newspaper to cover,”

said Dispatch Editor in Chiefjohn
Camp. “Most schools of Pitt’s size
have three or four campus
newspapers.”

“When I came here as a
freshman, I thought that it was a
crime that a school as large as Pitt
only had one student newspaper,”
said Rich Horton, operations
manager for The Dispatch.

Blacks fail in white classrooms

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Sta_[)“ Writer

When black and white
cultures collide in the
classroom, it is the black child
that suffers the injuries of
repression and discourage-
ment, according to Pitt Provost
Donald Henderson.

“African Americans are as
culturally different in their own
ways as, say, Chinese
Americans,” said Henderson.
“Black children are not ready

for school nor is the school
ready for black children. What
is not taken in account [by
schools] is that black culture is
a distinctive culture different
from the dominant culture.”
In a talk held by Pitt’s Black
Faculty Forum yesterday
Henderson described the
situation in which black
children bring the values,
attitudes and behaviors of their,
homes into the classroom and
are expected by their teachers
to behave like white children.

Jason}-iillrnan/I‘he Pitt New

“Teachers often incorrectly
assume that the deep [cultural]
structures underlying chil dren’s
behavior are the same as theirs
and if it isn't, then it is their job
to make it so," he said. “This is
repressive.”

As an example, Henderson
called on his own childhood
memories of showing deference
by avoiding looking adults in
the eyes and being of accused
of “rolling his eyes” at adults
when he did look.

Students can demand decent housing, fair treatment

By Mark Smith
Staﬂ" Writer

A recent letter asked, “Is a
landlord responsible for tenant
property damage if the landlord
has been negligent?” Renters,
especially student renters, have
questions concerning leases,
evictions and security problems.
About one-quarterof the U.S.
population rents its living spaces.
Roughly 14,000 fu1l—time Pitt
graduate and undergraduate
students live in off-campus
housing. The rights of tenants
are a serious matter for Pitt
students.

“During a storm an old
television antenna fell off my
apartmentbuilding’s roofand
smashed the hood and
window of my truck. Is the
landlord liable for the
damages?”

Answer: It depends. If the
landlord was negligent, you could
sue for money damages to repair

your truck. You would have to
prove that the landlord was
negligent. Discuss the situation
with your landlord. If you cannot
reach a reasonable settlement,
Contact your local magistrate or
small-clairns court for a hearing.

Question: What is the
Implied Warranty of
Habitability?

Answer: The Implied Warranty
of Habitability guarantees all
renters basic minimum housing
standards, or the renters will not
have to pay for these basic
standards which they do not
receive. Landlords must provide
tenants with safe, habitable and
sanitary housing. A few
cockroaches and dirt in a hallway
outside your apartment don’t
breach the Warranty of
Habitability. An army of
cockroaches, windows without
locks, no heat in January or a
ﬂood from a hole in a roof all
constitute a breach of the Implied
Warranty of Habitability. Here’s

a brief guideline to determine
inhabitable conditions:

1. Is there a violation in the
housing code?

2. Can potential harm result

from the defect?
5. What has been the length of

time of the defect or deficiency?

4. How old is the building and
how much is the rent?

5. Is the tenant responsible in
any way for the problem?

Question: Does a landlord
have to give notice before an
eviction?

Answer: Yes. In fact, in most
states, a landlord cannot evict a
tenant. Only the courts can evict
a tenant. A tenant can be evicted
for not paying rent or failing to
leave when a lease runs out. If
you don’t pay rent, your landlord
will most likely try to evict you. If
the landlord has violated housing
codes or the Warranty of
Habitability, a landlord’s
complaint against the tenant may
fail. There are defenses against
an eviction. An army of vermin
living in your apartment may
persuade a court to rule in your
favor. You may want to read the

Classes, committees and events /eeep coordinator busy

By Tammy Poole
Staff Writer

Last year, Debbie Taylor, student
coordinator for the PittlProgram Council,
designed a poster for the “Protect Yourself’
seminar.

This is the poster she designed:

THIS COULD BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT TEST
YOU'LL EVER HAVE TO TAKE

DON'T GET CAUGHT UNPREPARED!

ATTEND

PROTECT
YOURSELF

A seminar on Responslble Sex

“I just couldn’t believe that I had done
that. Everyone in the [PPC] thought that it
was such a great poster  and it is,

because the meaning is so strong,” Taylor
said as she sat upright in her chair.

“But the only problem is that if someone
wanted to attend the seminar, they
wouldn’t know where to go,” she said.

After carefully analyzing the publicity
sign, a student interested in attending the
seminar wouldn’t know where or when
the seminar was held, she said. _

Taylor glanced at the poster, propped
her hand underneath her chin and laughed.
With a sign of embarassment, she said that
she simply forgot to include that
information on the poster.

Taylor is a communications major, an
English writing minor, a member of Sigma
Sigma Sigma‘ sorority, an employee at
Pitt’s housing authority, and, on top of all
of that, has new responsibilities at the Pitt
Program Council.

“Basically, what I do is act as a liaison if
there is a problem that should arise
between the students and the advisers,
Tom Misuraca and Dana Keefer,” said
Taylor.

“Sometimes students find it easier to
talk to other students, and that’s where I
come in,” she said.

The senior from Connellsville, Pa., serves
as a representative for the organization.
She is the primary person to Contact
whenever someone needs to be
interviewed or pointed in the right
direction.

In March, Taylor will also have to choose
new directors for the Pitt Program Council
and appoint them to each committee.

“I don’t think that it's going to be easy,”

she said.

“There are so many people on this
campus and we only have nine committees,
even though there will be more than nine
people who are qualiﬁed for each position.
But I think I can handle it,” Debbie said.

When asked how she copes with all of
her responsibilities, Taylor remarked that
things at the PPC are not as stressful as they
are elsewhere. .

“I’m always doing something, but I like
to keep busy,” she said after slightly shifting

her position in the chair.

“I have free time, but not the kind of free
time where I can just sit down and read a
book for the fun of it. For 10 hours a week
I have to be here in the office and so does
every other committee director,” Taylor
said.

It is the surprises that sometimes occur
with an event that may cause a little
tension for Taylor. However, whether an

event is cancelled due to rain or the late

N eW.ad1ninistrator pledges to be accessible to students

By Kurt N. Stark
For The Pitt News

He wants to be known as a
friend to the students, an enemy
of student apathy, and he has
promised that he will be
accessible and accountable to the
students.

“My respect will be for. the
students, and I hope the students
will respect [me]. I know that it
has to be gained, but I think time
will tell that I am an advocate for
students,” William Harmon, Pitt’s
new vice president for student
affairs, said.

' Harmon wants to establish a
positive relationship with the
students and stressed that his
office will be accountable to the
students.

“If students feel they are having
some difficulty or there are
problems with the quality of
services being offered, they
should know that they can come
to someone and get, if not
immediate action, an explanation
of the causes of the difficulties,”
he said.

Harmon was hired after an
extensive search to find a
replacement for Conney M.
Kimbo, Ph.D., who died of cancer
on April 13, 1989. Harmon took
over the position this fall and
already has certain ideas about
what he wants his job to entail.

“I would hope that it is
providing the administrative
leadership on the student affairs
side of the university in terms of
dealing with concerns students
have in dealing with the transition
to university life,” he said. Student
affairs consists of residence life,
which includes residence halls,
food service, job placement,

guidance and counseling, Student
Health Service and student
activities. In

Harmon stressed the
importance of students being
involved. "I think it is a way to
prevent academic burnout,” he
said.

He feels that students
concerned only with academics
are “shortchanging themselves
because they are not experiencing
the full ﬂavor of university life,
and prospective employers will
recognize a well-rounded
person.” He also praised Pitt’s
environment and called it an
excellent laboratory for the larger
society.

 

Op

“[Students should] I have the
opportunity to get involved in
administering and developing
their own leadership styles and
skills,” he said.

Harmon also commented on
the level of student influence in
the administration of the
university.

“One of the things we find
historically is that students feel as
if they don’t have a say in the
governance of the university. In
some instances that is true
because there are things that will
occur on a day— to—day basis. But
there are other areas where the
students have more inﬂuence than
they think regarding policy in the

university, such as the planning
of the new dormitories.”

Harmon is very concerned
about the transition to university
life students go through,
especially concerning minority
students‘. The Black Action Society
is an organization that can really
aid students in this transition, he
said.

“It is an organization that I
consider to be involved in
leadership development, but they
also have another role serving as
a mentor for other black and
minority students on campus,”
he said.

He said the BAS is composed
of students who have some

Campuses are committed to improving the quality of life for all
students - particularly ethnic minorities. Yet instances of racial
harassment and intimidation continue. This videoconference
will provide an opportunity for all members of the campus
community to consider the impact of these incidents on
individuals and on the community, explore some of the reasons
for the behavior and consider the correct legal context — freedom
of speech and the Supreme Court’s deﬁnition of “fighting
words.” Sucessful strategies, models and approaches will be
highlighted as well as lists of selected readings and resource
materials.

The framework for this Teleconference which is the ﬁrst
of a two-part series on ”Enhancing Campus Community"

is provided by taped remarks from Dr. Ernest Boyer and
excerpts from the report, "Campus Life in Search of
Community " recently published by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Six
principles are set forth in the report and discussed by Dr.

Boyer as an "eﬁ’ective formula for day-to-day decision-
making on the campus" and which "deﬁne the kind of
community every college and university should strive to
be. " These principles are highlighted and used to set the
tone and focus the discussion for the teleconferences.

Henderson

Continued from page 1

This aspect of black upbringing
is directly opposed to a white
teacher’s expectation that students
should look the teacher in the
eyes to show that she or he is
paying attention, he said.

“That would get you popped,

where I grew up," said
Henderson.
The result of such

misunderstandings is a sense of
confusion and frustration which
affects the teacher, and more
significantly, the child, Henderson
said.

."The [black] child expects adults
in school to act like the adults he
has been in contact with all of his
life,‘ he said.

Confronted by an environment
in which the rules she or he has
been brought up with do not
work, the black child often
becomes unresponsive to
teaching, according to
Henderson. This
unresponsiveness is explained
away by the teachers as the result
of cultural deprivation.

This label, said Henderson, is
false and misleading. No one can
be culturally deprived if she or he
is functioning and interacting in a
culture.

 

Most of these so-called deprived
children function with intelligence
and success in the black
community, and this label
represses these children in the
school environment, Henderson
said.

“Thousands of kids across the
country are classified as
uneducable,” he said. “[To the
teachers] this means that it’s all
right not to make every attempt
to teach them.”

Stephanie Brown, a doctoral
candidate in the clinical
psychology program who
attended the talk, said that the
difficulty of coming from a black
culture and learning in a white
environment affects her even in
her current pursuits.

“I feel as if I'm a five-year—old
trying to find my way in a foreign
environment,” she said.

“He had a lot of good points to
make,” said Lisa Davis, a senior
psychology major. “Teachers
think the kids are there for them
to mold. Teachers can’t expect
minority [students] to
automatically know the dominant
culture. I now see the perspective
that some of my teachers may
have had about me."

arrival of a performer, things
always work out in the end, she
said. ~

“About three or four years ago,
there was a performer who was

scheduled. to go on stage in 15

minutes, but his plane was late.
We had to keep going out on
stage saying, ‘He'll bewhere; he’ll
be here,’" Taylor said.

“The students were getting a
little impatient, but they can be a
lot more understanding than you
think.”

Taylor said that one of the
good things about being student
coordinator is having the
opportunity to meet so many
different and interesting people.
Meeting the musicians at the Jazz
Seminar last year was something
Taylor particularly enjoyed.

“One of our benefits is that we
get to meet some of the
entertainers that perform here.

When I met those awesome,
incredible jazz players, I was
sitting there talking to them, and
thought ‘Wow.’ But then you
realize, ‘Oh, OK, they’re people,
too,’ “ she said.

Student coordinator is the last
position that a student at the Pitt
Program Council can hold, so
after March, Taylor ‘s position
will be held by someone else at
PPC. Being a member of the
council, however, will be an
experience that she never forgets.

“It’s something about college
that means more than just going
to classes. I may not remember
whatl learned in Psych 10,'but I’ll
remember what I did here.”

Taylor slouched in her chair,
folded her arms in front of her
and gazed at the Arizona
postcards pinned to the file
cabinet above her desk.

“I love it. l’ll miss it,” she said.

Harmon

serve the institution well. They
have a high graduation rate, and
they will talk about the positive
experiences they had while at
the university outside of the
classroom.”

He said that the positives of the
Greek system far outweigh the
negatives. When negatives do
occur, they should be dealt with
individually and without blaming
the whole Greek system,
according to Harmon.

Joseph Cavalla, director of
student activities, said that he
can already see that Harmon is
genuinely concerned about
students.

Cavalla said, ‘‘I feel very
comfortable with lHarmon’s] style
of management in dealing with

the directors and the students.
He is very open; he is very pro-
student and concerned about
students’ rights and the services
we provide for them. I think he
will be an advocate for the
students.”

Concerning plans for the future,
Harmon said his office plans to
assess the quality of the services

that it provides by means of a

survey, and that the students can
help by being honest in their
appraisal of the services that are
offered and developed on their
behalf.

Harmon attended Seton Hall
University in New Jersey, where
he received his master's degree.
He received a doctorate at Kansas
State University.

Nicotine’s effect on weight studied

By Spencer Borisoff
For Tbe Pitt News

Smoking is a worldwide habit
that has left millions of people
consistently seeking cigarettes.

Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic’s department of psychiatry
is currently conducting a study
on the effects of nicotine.

The study, headed by Dr.
Kenneth A. Perkins, assistant
professor of psychiatry, focuses
on two specific projects.

“One study is concerning the
acute effects of nicotine on factors
relating to body weight, while
the other area concentrates on
differences in the way smokers
and non-smokers respond to

nicotine,” Perkins said.

The study in relation to eating,
according to Perkins, will
expectedly reveal why smokers
frequently weigh less than non-
smokers, as well as why people
tend to gain weight when they
quit smoking. Approximately four
years of research have revealed
some informative results, Perkins
said, although the study is still in
progress.

“We’ve found that nicotine
increases metabolic rates and that
smoking does not suppress
eating,” Perkins said.

The study contrasting smokers’
and non—smokers’ responses to
nicotine has lasted for one year.
It is more wide-ranging than the

previous study and is researching
what makes people want to
smoke. The research focuses on
defining tolerance levels of
nicotine, the cardiovascular
differences between smokers and
non-smokers, and whether
nicotine actually improves helps
smokers maintain
concentration, Perkins reported.

The subjects of the study are
young adults, primarily students,
who, according to Perkins, “come
in multiple times and are either
given nicotine or are not given
nicotine. Then we see what
happens.”

Male and female subjects and
smokers and non-smokers are
needed for further research.

Dispatch

Continued from page 1

Although Horton and Camp
have minimal experience with
journalism, they believe The
Dispatch can succeed.

“I’ve never had anything
whatsoever to do with a
newspaper or any other
publication. You don’t have to be
studying writing to be able to
write and think well and
coordinate a [newspaper],” said
Horton, a senior majoring in
applied mathematics. “We don’t
think [anything] should stop us.
We have as much ability and
determination as anyone.”

The third , member of the
triumvirate behind The Dispatch
is . Tod Parham,  .s.tL1.dent..iI1.-..the
College ~v - of General Studies.
Parham is the editorial cartoonist
and the managing» editor.

The -Dispatch originated last
spring when Camp and Horton,
members of Students Against
Racism, were preparing to publish
a newsletter for the organization.

“We figured, why bother with
a newsletter? We might as well

put out a newspaper,” said Camp.

“We thought, ‘Why not begin a
serious publication which would
address the problem of racism
along with other problems as
well — and be interesting and
entertaining at the same time?’ “
Horton said.

A lack of quality in The Pitt
News was also a catalyst for The
Dispatch, said Camp. “Some of
the articles [last year] were just
outrageous.”

Camp was offended by a Pitt
News article printed last year —— a
front-page interview with a priest
who said that homosexuality
should be vehemently
discouraged. » A

“At that point we realized ,t,l:1_a,I;
Pitta needed not just.-~a» 7new
viewpoint but a better one. -I just
thought [that article] was a lousy
piece of journalism,” said Camp.

However, the coordinators of
The Dispatch do not intend to
compete with ThePittNews, Pitt’s
official student newspaper since
1905.

Camp intends for TheDispatch
to be more politically involved
than The Pitt News, listing the
promotion of student
participation in campus
government as an aim of the
publication.

“I’d like to get students more
involved in student—government
elections and push for the
formation of a student senate,”
said Camp. “What you get in a
student senate is a  miniature
democracy. Student groups and
individuals would be

Squeezing the competition. ..

The University of Pittsburgh has taken another step in
the direction of phasing out all independent businesses
which sellonly items with the Pitt logo.

Pitt has filed a civil lawsuit with Charles Bonasorte, the
vendor who sells Pitt items on the corner of Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard. The university claims

that Bonasorte’s business phone number, 422ePI'IT,t

infringes on its trademark.
Furthermore, after receiving a letter of complaint from

the university that Bonasorte’s van obstructs the View of '

Bigelow from the left lane of Forbes, the city revoked
Bonasorte’s vending license, claiming that he violated a
city-vending ordinance.

Both of these actions were taken on Sept. 28, virtually
blocking all business that Bonasorte might attract away
from the university over the weekend. ‘

Bonasorte said that he parks his van at the corner of
Bigelow Boulevard and Forbes Avenue to unload his
merchandise, and then he moves it to a meter space.

Under city law, a vendor must be cited and convicted on
four such violations before his or her license can be taken.
In 1990, Bonasorte has not even been cited, let alone
convicted, according to his attorney Ray Radakovich.

A ., University general counsel Lewis Popper claims that Pitt

must file a lawsuit against any person or business which
uses the Pitt logo. Hesaid that people could get confused

. and connect Bonasorte with the university, with which he

has no formal affiliation. Otherwise, he said, the university
will lose the rights of its trademark.

Pitt now operates a store on Forbes Avenue which sells
Pitt paraphernalia. Bonasorte said that he did not have
any problems with the university until it opened this store.

The university administration is more concerned about
its competition than its trademark. Pitt is attempting to
squeeze thecompetitor out of the way.

Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Pitt has gone
after a small business in an attempt to make more money
on its logo. Last year, the university did not renew the
lease ofjay McKenzie, owner of the now-defunct University
Shop, a store that had been there for nearly 30 years. This
is where the university-owned store -now operates.

By blocking Bonasorte from conducting his vending
operation, Pitt is engulﬁng its competition to gain more
money for itself. ‘

A university does not exist for the purpose of making
money, and at this point there are a number of issues, such
as the lack of minority faculty and students, the safety of
the campus and the selection of Pitt’s next president, that
are far more pressing than profits from sweatshirt sales.
But somehow, dollar signs always seem to push their way
to the forefront of the minds of Pitt administrators.

SGB   responds to editorial

The statements made in regard to the Student
Government Board in the Oct. 1, 1990 issue of
The Pitt News are gross, misrepresentative
generalizations which fail to understand the basic
elements of campus government. The accusations
are that the SGB is irresponsible, unresponsive
and unrepresentative of the student body as a
whole. However, the SGB itself is the direct result
of a wholly open elections process. The
Chairpersons of SGB’s committees and members
of the allocations committee are chosen by an
open application and interview process. Several
committees have open—membership policies
which require only attendance for membership.
A closed appointment is atypical and certainly
not the norm. If the composition of the board and

its committees reﬂects a bias toward white,‘

rniddle-class heterosexuals, one need look no
further than the electorate for the cause.

The assumption is that this composition mJ;_§_t
yield callous leadership. Yet, the board has been
particularly receptive to the

and one editorial inthe Sept. 20 issue of The Pitt.

News, ‘Illegally Parked Bikes Block Disabled
Entrances,” by Randy Legersky, and “Time for Boots
on Bicycles?” Both articles were addressing the
“problem” of illegally parked bicycles on the Pitt
campus.

The former had a very valid point. That is, bicycles
should not be blocking a handicapped ramp in front
of the student union. It also mentioned the 16
designated bicycle parking lots that are spread
throughout the campus. It is very thoughtful of the
university to provide the students and faculty with
this space for bicycles. However, we feel that limiting

received a fair distribution in .
their annual budget requests to do the types of
programming necessary to their constituencies.
All student groups are invited to the Representative
Student Council to make their concerns heard
before the board. All SGB members keep 10

posted office hours during which time we are ‘

obliged to speak to anyone on any matter. As a
representative institution, there is little more that
could be done for special interests without further
accusations of favoritism.

The real challenge to student groups who feel
they are not represented by the SGB is to learn to
take advantage of the opportunities offered to
them. In this I do not mean that other groups
should be absorbed by the “system,” but that
through either direct representation on the board
or outside inﬂuence to alter the board's positions.
That is simply the way that politics works on all
levels —— special interests have a reciprocal
responsibility to assist in their own representation.

The board is always ready to listen if student
groups can make an effort to communicate a
message. Lisa Campoli, likewise, is an open-
minded, reflective and sincere individual who
will certainly take into the selection—committee
deliberations all concerns which are expressed to
her. The voice of the collective student body has
not been lost in Lisa’s appointment, but has
instead been given a poised and articulate outlet.

took the situation one step further.
First, the article stated that the majority
of complaints against cyclists involved the
handicapped entrance to the union. We already
agreed this practice must stop. Next, it proposed
registration of bicycles (?!?!’!‘#/\&‘@) and booting
illegally parked bicycles.

We feel that the bicycles should be allowed to be
parked anywhere they do not directly obstruct traffic.
Locking bicycles to the parking meters on Bigelow
Boulevard, the trees outside of the Cathedral of
Learning, the stairway railing outside of Forbes
Quad, and many other “undesignated” parking spots
in NO WAY obstructs anyone who is walking with
their eyes open.

We think the advocates of inane policies such as
registration of bicycles and booting bicycles should
keep a few things in mind. Cyclists should be treated
specially. Unlike all the students and faculty members
who commute to Pitt by car (sometimes from distances
anyone could handle on a bicycle), we do not
contribute to traffic congestion, pollution, gasoline
waste, deadly accidents or parking problems. We
promote a mode of transportation that is convenient
(when you are allowed to park anywhere), healthy
and enjoyable. All readers of this should support the
cyclists, instead of trying to make life difficult for
everyone. We thank you for your support.

Patchwork pla proves sub-pa for Panthers

By Scott Campbell

For over a month now, Pitt
Coach Paul Hackett has been
saying that his Panthers were not,
repeat, not a very good football
team. ‘

The only problem was that
nobody paid any attention. Not
his players, who envisioned
themselves playing on Jan. 1. Not
the media, who looked down the
Pitt roster and saw a bundle of
names that oozed potential but
little experience. Not the fans,
who listened to the first two and
who. were swept up in the
preseason hullaballoo.

But after last Saturday’s 58-24

listening to Hackett.

By the time the Panthers take
the field again on Oct. 13 against
Rutgers, it will be more than a
month since their last win. And
the season, while not bleak,
doesn’t look as bright as it did in
August.

At 2-2-1, and with Notre Dame,
Miami, Penn State and a no-
longer-underrated Louisville still
on the schedule, the Panthers
may be looking at their first losing
season in six years.

That’s a possibility that Hackett
realizes, and with a week off, one
that he hopes to correct by Oct.

the offense struggles.

one reason for the Panthers’
inconsistent play, but with up to
14 players nursing injuries, the
Panthers are having a hard time
ﬁlling those spots.

“We just have to ask other
people to step in,” said Hackett
before the West Virginia game.
“This is a team game. When this
kind of thing happens, you just
do your best with what you have. ”

Unfortunately for the Panthers
they didn’t do that last Saturday,
as the final score showed.

over again,” said Hackett. “I’m
getting real tired of it. Can you
imagine a guy running 33 yards
for a touchdown and then
fumbling at the one—yard line?
And then Olanda [Truitt, a wide
receiver] getting called for a foul
on the sidelines [on a running
play]? Youth is a problem, but
we’re not so young any more.
They’ve got five games under
their belt.”

Not that the Panthers don't
realize their problem.

“We need to ask a lot of each
other,” said quarterback Alex Van
Pelt. “We have to be intelligent.
You can’tblame it on the offensive
[scheme]. The play calls are
working; we're just not executing.

going to get. It’s time to sit back
and look at the direction that this
team is headed.

“As a football team we’ve got to
come to grips with reality. We
have to eliminate the visions of

grandeur,” Hackett added.

On offense the team has trouble
executing plays, and on defense
they just have trouble.

“Offensively we seem to find
ways to self-destruct,” said

Hackett. “Yes, we have a young

team that didn’t have a lot of

experience, but We’ve played ﬁve
games now —-— we’ve got to play
better than that.”

The Panthers have fumbled 14
times and had three passes
intercepted this year many times
when the Panthers were on the
doorstep of scoring. And then

there are the times that the team
was actually halfway through the
threshold, as when Kevin
Williams sprinted 33 yards last
Saturday before the Mountaineers’
Cecil Doggette knocked the ball

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
continued its consistent, strong play with
a victorious run through a solid field of
competitors in the Syracuse University
Tournament last weekend.

The Lady Panthers raised their overall 9

record to 12-2.

The team began by defeating host
Syracuse in four games, 15-13, 15-0, 11-15,
1 5-6. That raised the team’s record against
Big East teams to 2-0.

Saturday afternoon they came from a
two-games-to— one deficit to defeat San
Diego State in five games, 15-13, 4-15, 8-
15, 15-10, 15-8.

“They're also ranked in the Top 20,” said
Lady Panther coach Sue Woodstra, “Each
year they do about that well or better.
They are a strong team. It’s especially
good because we came from two games to
one down. They also took UCLA to five
games.”

The Lady Panthers lost to the UCIA
Bruins in five games in their second match
this season.

The win vs. San Diego State gave the

.team a record of 2-2 against Top 20 teams

this year.
They clinched the tournament
championship by rolling past Maryland in

three games, 15-7, 15-8, 15-5.

Freshman middle hitter Carrie Thornton
returned to play in the Syracuse
Tournament, but Woodstra said,
“[’Ihornton’s] done for the season."

Thornton re-injured the knee she hurt
earlier this season, and she will have
surgery. -

Junior outside hitter Bridget Gary did
not play in Syracuse, but she is expected

to return for the team’s matches in the v

Georgia Tournament this weekend.

“The injuries haven’t really affected us.
Everyone else has just picked it up a bit,”
said Woodstra. ‘

Theteam will start off this weekend’s
tournament by playing against host Georgia
Friday night.

“Georgia is tough,” Woodstra said when
asked what kind of competition she expects
in the tournament. “They are very athletic,
quick and powerful. They are young, so
they’ve been kind of up and down, but
they have the potential to be giant killers.”

If they beat the Lady Dogs, they will face
the winner of the Duke-Florida match.
The Lady Panthers swept Duke in three
games earlier this season in the Wisconsin
Tournament by scores of 15-9, 15-6, 15-8.
Woodstra reiterated the opinion she gave
of Duke at that time: “They’re not ranked,
but they very well could be." Woodstra
said she knows very little about Florida.

C01/mtvy team beats W/I/U

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

West Virginia’s football team gave
the Panthers more -than they could
handle Saturday at Pitt Stadium, but
down in Morgantown the Mountaineers
just couldn’t keep up with Pitt's cross

country team, and these days it looks _

like nobody can.

The men's team remains unbeaten
after defeating Bucknell and West
Virginia Saturday.

The women’s team continued to gain
valuableexperience against Division I
teams. It placed third with 63 points,
behind WestVirginia (19) and Bucknell
(57) and ahead of ‘Cleveland State (123).

Coach Jim Lear was a little concerned
with Bucknell going into the men’s
meet because he hasn't had a team beat
them since he became coach in 1985.
But he said that although Bucknell
didn’t nm badly, Pitt beat Bucknell
“handily.” Bucknell managed 55 points
to Pitt's 23.

Two weeks ago in the Spike Shoe
Invitational at State College, Pitt beat
Penn State for the first time in 15 years,

and the win over Bucknell broke another
spell.

“I told the kids it's just one more ghost
out of the closet. Penn State’s out, and
now Bucknell’s out," said Lear.

West Virginia, which placed third
with 74 points, was even less of a threat
to Pitt. Its top man placed on eighth.

Lear said his team’s advantage over
Bucknell was its strength up front. “Our
top guys are faster than their top guys,
and we knew if we beat them up front,
then we'd win."

Keith Dowling led the way for Pitt .
with another victory, his third in as
many meets this season. He completed
the five mile course in 25 minutes, 42
seconds with teammate Jason Bodnar
10 seconds behind. Bucknell’s Dan
Deardorff placed third and interrupted
the Panthers’ grouping. Butjim Hamilton
and Scott Humphrey finished fourth
and fifth, respectively, and Pitt's ﬁfth
man, Mike Formica, placed 11th to seal
the victory.

Bucknell runners finished sixth,
seventh, ninth and 10th to capture
second overall.

Lady Panther tennis team finds it tou

By Rob Mazur
Sta_ﬂ“ Writer

This weekend, the University
of Pittsburgh women’s tennis
team traveled to Trenton, NJ. for
a match with thevTrenton State
women’s team and then skipped
across town to compete in the
Women’s Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships at Veterans Park.

While their ﬁnal results do not
look good on paper, Coach
George Dieffenbach said it was
“good for building experience. It
allowed us to gain match
experience while preparing for
the Big East Championships.”

In the match with Trenton State
the Lady Panthers lost 2-7,
dropping their record to 3-4. The
match was closer than it looks,
however, according to
Dieffenbach.

“This match could have gone
either way. There were really
some close scores. _If we had
won only a couple more points,
the score could have gone the
other way,” said Dieffenbach.

In singles action, No. 1 Julie
LoPrinzi continued her winning
ways for the team, defeating
Kathy Meola, 2-6, 6-1, 6-0.

Kathryn Bratton, No. 2, was
beaten by Jill Mandato, 5-7, 3-6.
No. 3 singles Jill Cohen lost a
three—set match to Kristen
Halmburg, 6-2, 6-7 (3-7), 1-6.
Barb McCarthy, playing No. 4
singles, dropped her match to Jill
Roth, 3-6, 2-6. In No. 5 singles,
Josie Neiswenter lost to Samantha
Nichols, 0-6, 1-6. The No. 6 singles
player Cheryl Sheppard fell to
Christina Soto, 2-6, 2-6.

In doubles action LoPrinzi and
Bratton salvaged Pitt’s second
win, defeating Meola and
Mandato, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2. “This was
a highlight of the match. We
were really happy LoPrinzi could
win in both singles and combine
with Bratton to win doubles,”
said Dieffenbach. Roth and
Nichols of Trenton State beat
Cohen and McCarthy, 2-6, 7-6, 6-
O. Halmburg and Amber Hall,
also of Trenton State, won their
match against Neiswenter and
Sheppard, 0-6, 0-6.

Coach Dieffenbach added that,

> “This match would have been

closer if we had our No. 1 singles
player Erika Devins. She definitely
would have had a positive impact

.on the outcome. Trenton State

was the Division III champion in

women’s tennis in 1986, so it has
an excellent team and an
excellent program. All in all the
match was respectable."

After that Friday match the
Lady Panthers took part in the
Women’s Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships in Trenton. This
tournament was quite large, with
22 teams participating. Teams
from Pitt, University of Maryland,
Cornell University, James
Madison University, Concordia
College, Seton Hall University,
United States Military Academy
and Howard University all
competed. The players were
divided into three ﬂights, or
brackets, with a single-
elimination format. The No. 1
and 2 players competed in the
first ﬂight. The No. 3 and 4 players
participated in the second ﬂight.
The third flight consisted of the
No. 5 and 6 players. The doubles
tournament was a double
elimination event. 1

In action from the first ﬂight
Julie LoPrinzi defeated Shannon‘
Barry of USMA, 6-1, 6-1, but was
eliminated by Leanie Stern of
Maryland, 5-6, 4-6. Bratton was

Soccer team loses to Ohio State, 3-1, falls below .500

By Christopher Block

Stajf Writer .

When viewing the performance of the
Pitt soccer team this season it is obvious
that the results have been as turbulent as
a plane ride through a thunderstorm.

After beginning the season with a 2-1

. record the Panther squad followed losses

to West Virginia and Georgetown with a
seven-goal victory against Slippery Rock
last Wednesday before falling to the Ohio
State Buckeyes on Sunday afternoon by a
score of 3-1.

The Panthers started out strongly,
pressuring the Ohio State defense

throughout the first half. Pitt scored its

lone goal on a header off a Buckeye
defender that sailed in past the goalie.
This was the only lead of the game for
Pitt, for Ohio State rebounded from its
early deficit to score on two penalty shots
off of starting goaltender Jay Kapusta. The

penalty shots were awarded :1‘s"”a resiiltjof I

two Pitt penalties.

Kapusta has played relatively well this
season, producing a 2.44 goals—against
average in his five starts this season. He
has allowed 11 goals and saved 24 shots in
455 minutes played.

Unfortunately for Pitt, Ohio State's
defense would hold and in the waning
moments of the game, the Buckeyes would
add another goal to close the game with a

3-1 victory and drop the Panthers’ record
to 3-4.

As for Pitt’s play, the consensus among
those close to the team was that this was
a game that they could have won. b

‘‘We played fairly well;._there wasno real

"hrE‘akdown,"’ said Pitt6oa'c1iJoe>Luixbaéherié"
I j“We had our chances but just. couldn’t

score. We really played hard but not as
well as we are capable of performing.” .

When asked about the two penalty
shots Luxbacher noted that “there were
some tough calls from the officials, but the
fact is that we had our chances to put the
game in a position where those calls
wouldn’t have mattered.”

Defenseman Brian Pelligrino, whose

yellow card led to one of the Ohio State
penalty shots, said, “I don’t think that we
played that well. There were a few
questionable calls that hurt us. Ohio State
was a strong team physically, but we
should’ve be.aiten‘their'1.”   I ‘  I . ‘
'-  ' “"The-*1<'ey’44 to us winning is‘ ‘ everyone
giving‘ 100 ‘percent and working. hard
during the entire game,” said midfielder

PITI‘ BITS: The Panthers will try to put
this game behind them now as they play
Indiana University of Pennsylvania on
Wednesday and Big East rival St. Jolin’s in
New York on Saturday. The road will not
get any easier. The Panthers play
Connecticut and Syracuse later this month.

Continued from page 7
outing [11-34 for 141 yards and
two interceptions] against
Oklahoma, Van Pelt’s stats are
improving every week.

“We have a brilliant

,._qu arterback, but he ’s surrounded

by a cast that sputters,” said
Hackett. “Our offense is catered
to Alex, maybe too much. We’ll
have to see.” ,

Not that the offense is alone in
its inconsistent play.

The defense has surrendered
110 points in its last three games,
the second-largest, three-game

2".‘ total in 19 years, and it has given

up 987 rushing yards during that
stretch.

Hackett indicated that he may
make some major changes
concerning the defense before
the next game.

“One, we’ll look at the scheme
[currently a 5-4 defense]. Two,
we'll look at the people within
that scheme,” said Hackett. “I
don’t want to say that it’s the
people; I want to say it’s the
scheme, but lwe’ll have to seel.”

By moving to a 4-3 defense, the

team would place an extra man
on the line to help the struggling
running defense. The
Mountaineers were able to
double—team on the nose tackle
early last Saturday and gain most
of their yards up the middle.

“We have to reassess our goals,”
said linebacker and defensive
captain Craig Gob. “[West Virginia]
was a big disappointment, but if
we let it get to us, that will hurt us
down the road.”

Pitt’s next three games are at
home, and despite the fact that
Notre Dame and Miami loom off
in the near future, Hackett said
the Panthers will take the season
one game at a time for the rest of
the season. They almost have to.
Many Panthers were counting on
playing ball on New Year’s Day,
but that is out of the question
now.

Changes of some shape will
unfold over the next two weeks
on both offense and defense.
The only question that remains is
whether that will be enough to.
scrape together enough wins for
any bowl bid.

Continued from page 7

Pitt had four runners place in
the top five, but Lear said its
grouping Saturday wasn’t as good
as it usually is. He attributed it to
the weather and to the nature of
West Virginia’s course.

“It was a very hilly course, and
the weather was hot,” Lear said.
“It’s hard to have good grouping
when you have those conditions
because different kids feel the
effects of those things differently.
Bucknell had the same problem.
The race was tight for a while, but
when the pack broke, it broke.”

This Friday, the men’s team
travels to Notre Dame and will
run a very ﬂat course. Lear said it
will be interesting to see how his
team makes the transition coming
off the West Virginia meet.

“Actually I2 think we can do
well on either one, and that's the
big thing right now," said Lear.

Pitt will face tough competition

at Notre Dame, including Virginia,
Edinboro and nationally ranked
NOIIC Daflllc and Cciiti al
Michigan. 1

“If we win [at] Notre Dame,-

then we’re for real," Lear said.
“That would be a statement.”

Although the women’s team is
still struggling somewhat against
the strong Division 1 teams, it is
making its presence felt. The team
finished just six points behind
Bucknell and challenged for a
second- place team finish.

“I think we could’ve beaten
them. But they got us in the
second half of the race,” Lear
said. “Some of our kids didn't
finish strong, and some of theirs

did. That's a trademark of

Bucknell. They're not
exceptionally fast, but they’re
strong. Our women weren’t ready

for that, whereas our men were,

prepared.”

In the third singles flight

The West Virginia meet was the ’ '

first collegiate race for Corle, a
freshman. An ankle injury kept
her from competing in previous
meets but she should be back in
the lineup for good.

This Saturday, the Lady
Panthers will face local teams in
the Pittsburgh City
Championships at Schenley Park.
Besides Pitt the field consists of
Carnegie Mellon, Robert Morris
and Duquesne.

“I think we should win it,” Lear
said. “On the other hand,
Duquesne’s not bad and neither
is CMU.”

Question: Can a tenant
challenge unfair deductions
from a security deposit?

Answer: Yes — however, it is
the tenant's responsibility. Go to
a small-clairns court if the deposit
is under $1,000. A landlord can
only ask for one month's rent for
a security deposit. A tenant can
ask for interest from a security
deposit in Pennsylvania.
