and Hitler “would be culminated

Even if John Bull hadn’t beat
Hitler to the draw, apact between
the two dictator nations would be
highly- improbable. Both Italy and
Germany, although blood brothers

by nature of government, would '

be irreconcilable to each other
because.t‘h‘ey' are out for their own
gain individually.
Teutonic Cry

Since the‘. Treaty of Versailles
we have had 'a sullen Germany,
who has sulked like a punished
child. “Colonies-——give us colo-
nies," was"the Teutonic cry. The
answer ‘to’<t.hat cry was Hitler, a
direct result of Versailles, who
commenced his career by scrap-
ping the treaty.

On aiparallel, Italy has express-
ed a similar desire. At the begin-
ning of the Great War, Italy stood
outside the pale. But enticed by
offers of colonies and reimburse-
ments, Italy fought for the Allied
powers. However, after the last
drop of ink had dried Italy’s cues
had been -“forgotten.”

Thus, in the two leading fascist
nations today we have had two
reasons to fear for peace. How-
ever, since» Mussolini has come to
agreement ‘with England, and
Germany and Italy are after the
same “gold ,mine in the sky,”
prospects "of war for several years
to come are unlikely.

Indirect Allies

In addition to a pact with Italy,
Great Britain and France rejuven-
ated relations a few days ago. So,

Speech, Poetry

Two cash prizes and a volume
of poetry will be the awards for
winners of the annual University
speech and poetry contests, it was
announced today by the speech

Preliminary contests in the per-

to take Czechoslovakia now that
there is such a formidable alliance,
including Italy, against him.

There is only one doubtful
clause of the pact between Great
Britain and Italy. Their “mutual
understanding” will be ratiﬁed
only when and if Italy withdraws
her troops from Spain.

If Italy doesn’t withdraw her
troops from Spain, and the rebels
are victorious, this pact is mean-
ingless.

Thus, Hitler and Mussolini
might be thrown together again.
I believe however, that like dog

Sprigle Carries On

Pulitzer Tradition
ONG-RATULATIONS are due to Ray
Sprigle, Post-Gazette newshawk, for his at-
tainment of the goal toward which every sin-
cere newspapernian works, the Pulitzer Prize.

We haven’t a doubt in the world that
Sprigle series revealing Klan activities in the
South, with particular reference to one Huge
Black,’ was the greatest scoop pulled by any
paper in the country this year. Disregarding,
for a moment, any thought of the moral prin-
ciples involved, we must admit that for pure
journal’isn1, the Sprigle series was right across
the plate waist-high.

But. we couldn’t help but think back to the
days in New York when Joseph Pulitzer him-
self was editing his daily paper. Pulitzer’s
New York ‘World for a time had the reputation
of being the yellowest sheet which ever hit’ the
sidewalks of rowdy Manhattan, which is saying
sometliiiig.

Yes, indeed, Sprigle deserves the Pulitzer
prize. Eeyond all doubt, he is carrying onthe
great Pulitzer tradition.——H. R.

Pittpourri . . .

By Jack Lawlor
Campus Comment  h A 
Eugene (Lefty) Grennan that powerful little man

over at the Phi Gem shack who hails from Chicago,
made a very successful attempt to entice Peggy

engagement tea recently. Eugene slung his line by

a Frog pond while Peggy, no doubt, was very

much interested in the beautiful surroundings.

John (Casanovo)' ‘Baker motored to Ann Arbor

' last wk. end to see his Chinese doll, and perhaps
spent a little time at the Arboretum. (You really

have got something there Baker.) Dottie’

Abrams and her Frank (Pat) Patrick spent a very

own, way oﬁ in a. shady pasture near a brook in
McKeesport. Opps . . I’ve forgotten to mention
that Jim Van Kennan was also there with a, gal
from McKeespor.t, and I may add that they had four
cans of beer which were left over from Friday nitle.

Getting Around
As I have said before, John Glasser has been
EX’ed right out of the Dottie Oliver league, and as
I have said before, Dick Friday is the King-Pin .
(Bob Graf seems to be very much disappointed
since he tried so hard pursuading Mary Junge to
accept his Delt Pin . . But Mary said “No, No,
I am not your Beau, until I know you better” . . .
It looks like Peggy Megee and Roy Walters are all
washed up, and now Mary (The coming Soph)
Lewis and Roy are doing the nite spots together
. Jean Daugherty and Dick Paige seem to be
making the most of the few days remaining of this
semester.

Rumors

Charley Dimit is supposed to be the worst golfer
on campus, although they say he does enough prac-
ticing, he still remains the Worst along -‘fraternity
row . . . Jean Lawson and Ham Hamilton are sce-
ing quite a lot of each other. Three and sometimes
four times a wk. (Some pace if they can keep it
up.) . . .

Rumors Again

It’s been rumored that President of the Sammie
House, namely Louis (Jerome) Black has been go-
ing around Campus for three years carrying along
an alias as JEROME, we can’t ﬁgure out why he
keeps his correct name LOUIS a secret. (Inci-
dently the Sammies have moved into bigger and
better quarters on Bellefield St.) Pat Franklin is
planning to go to Bucknell this wk. end to see an
old ﬂame (Just a Pal) Bill Bl‘-um, (remember the
Sigma Chi Biggie of last year) .

That Old, Old Story

It is with the deepest regrets that we announce
this is our last effort at Pittpourri . . . We have had
a lot of fun writing this column and hope we haven’t
caused any ill feeling or treaded on too many toes

. We further suggest you give a lot of support

to Mary, Jack, Mercedes and Jane . . So long
and “Happy Pitching” . .

Letters
Editor, The Pitt News:

Rugy Aldisert, in his headlines column of Mon-
day’s News adequately explained the present need
for a permanent organization of the ICG in this
University. I want to continue the plea for Univer-
sity help. Last week-end’s delegates might Well
have taken advantage of the opportunity to make a
glorious three days of whoopee with a laugh’ at the
Political Science Department, but they came back
to tell a great story of enlightenment.

Why did they bring such a tale of good time back
It wasn’t because they had a
chance to get away~from home, nor was it just the
change from living at home to staying under a ho-
tel roof, that made them sing the praises of the In-
tercollegiate Conference on Gov’t.

The reason isn’t found in the fact that they didn’t
have to care about English Themes or P011 Sci
quizzes. Although all these are reason enough to
laud any cause, these students came back from I-lar-
risburg with the idea of doing more work on the
subject next year.

Why? Because they had found an interest in
government which they hadn’t seen before, an in-
terest the Political Science Dept. holds as its main
purpose. They had discussed in committee and had
spoken on the floor. They had seen 1og—rol1ing,
back scratching, and every other phase of politics,
except actual money bribing.

Mr. Editor, I say, again, for what better purpose
could the Univer_sity‘of Pittsburgh spend its; appro-
priationsdtrhan for the furtherance of an ‘intense in-'
terest in the actual government of the people of the
states. ~ ' . '

Committee Will N amc

Senior Award Winner

Faculty Members, ODK‘ Alumnus Will Select
Studefitf To "Have Name Engraved... On 
By Szdney Shore

, In ayclosedl" meeting last week,‘
; four faculty , members
‘alumnus of ODK selected the sen-

and.an

ior man who best combines char-
actér, scholarship, leadership, ﬁc-
tlvities, and social bearing.

Composed of Dr. V. W. Lanfear,
dean of men; Robert X. Graham,
director of the University News
Servicej Dr. Samuel H. Williams,
professor of biolog; ‘Robert D.
Ayars, professor of accounting;
and Walter G. Rome, alumni rep-
resentative of ODK, the group met
to choose the fourth senior to be
so honored.‘  -- 

FORMER RECIPIENT

The name ‘of the awardee and
those of his predecessors will be
inscribed on granite blocks lining
ODK Walk. As yet, none of the
lanes bordering the Cathedral has
been designated as ODK Walk;
nor has Gamma Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa set aside enough
money to pay for the project, but,
nevertheless, the award will be
announced Friday at Tap Day
ceremonies.

Former recipients of the honor
are Charles Foreman, C36; Rus-
sell Connolly, C36; and William
McQuade, E37.

This award is an outgrowth of
the George Wharton Pepper Prize
which originated in 1922. United
States Senator Pepper that year
returned to Chancellor Bowman a
$100 check that had been given
him for speaking at an assembly.
He asked the Chancellor to award
the money to the student who rep-
resented the best type of man

7

the University graduated. The-
award was given annually until
1932.

In ‘1935, the local ODK chapter
decided to continue the tradition
but to discontinue the check. In-
stead a permanent tribute to out-
standing students will be the
nameplates on the proposed Walk.
Included in the action of the group
was a motion to include on the
granite stone the names of all the
winners of the Pepper Prize.

Winners of the Pepper Prize
included) J. -Clyde Bar.t.on,.,pur-
chasing agent of the Uniive:rsity;'
Lawrence I. Klinestiver, BA22;
Ira Hill, BA24; Henry Cossitt,
D29. In 1925, the award was
given to a Woman, Anna B.
Schaab, Ed.

ELIGIBILITY RULES
Under the ODK set-up onlya

merly, senior students nominated
members of their class to be con-
sidered for the award. Realizing
that a large vote is indicative of
popularity rather than merit, the
committee has eliminated the
elections and now composes its
own list of nominees.

Eligibility rules for senior men
include: one year’s coltiiiuous
attendance at the University;
that candidates shall be senior
men who will be graduated from
the University within the year the
award is made; all candidates
shall have maintained a general
quality point average in all sub-

jects of 1.00 or above.

Congress Votes On Bill
For Fine Arts Bureau

By Bill Colker

Heartening "is the prospect of as‘

permanent Bureau of Fine Arts
under government control.

Introduced by Representative
Coffee of Washington in the House
and backed in the Senate by Pep-
per of Florida, it is expected that
the Coffee-Pepper Bill will be
acted upon in the next session of
Congress.

As stated in the declaration of
policy of the bill, there exists in
the United States the potentiali-
ties for a great and ﬂourishing
culture, which will, if properly
developed, make our country a
greater nation.

BUREAU OF ARTS

Under the_ present work—relief
program, this suggested program
would be subject to limitations.
Thus far it has been impossible
to establish reasonable tenure.
The personnel employed upon
projects cannot work to the best
of their creative ability while sub-.
ject to ‘momentary dismissal. To
accomplish this permanency of
cultural development, there is«
needed a long-range and adequate
plan.

All WPA-sponsored Federal
projects in the ﬁelds for the the-
ater, the dance, music, literature,
the graphic and plastic arts, and
architecture and decoration will
be transferred to the Bureau of
Fine Arts.

Persons now employed upon
Federal arts projects of the WPA
who are competent to carry out
the objectives of this act will con-
tinue in such employment with-
out interruption of time or salary
under the Bureau.

MINIMUIVI WAGE

Wages and working conditions
under the Bureau will be the
same as those established by trade
unions for similar work in private
industries.’”Inf‘no event will artists.»
employed under the Bureau re-

, ceivc less than $30 in ‘any week.

Persons employed under the
Bureau will not be subject to civil-
service laws. They will be en-
titled to all the rights, benefits,
and privileges of Federal employ-
es in/the matter of tenure, vaca-
tions, sick leave, retirement pay,
and all other rights, beneﬁts and
privileges." _, .

FREE FROM COERCION
®Person,s under the Bureau will

have  'ri-.gh.t -to or~ga‘n‘ize and s.e-, "1
lect representatives of their own’

choice for thepurpose of adjust-

ing grievances“ with the- Bureau,‘

free from interference, restraint,
or coercion,» .

M No .per,sor_i._ employed, orseeking
employment under “the. . Bureau

‘will be denied the benefits under .

this law because he is a member
of or aﬁiliated with any economic,
political, unemployed, or religious
organization. _ _
George Seibel, prominent Pitts-
burgh author and lecturer, chair-
man of the Pittsburgh branch of
the Federal Arts COlnIIlltt€x€,- will

discuss the provisions of thisbill"

Sports Editor

A at the ra.oes——Seeing a Stadiumfull at a track and
field meet  quite a jolting perception to a guy who has
grown quite lonely sitting in the stands in thistown and watch-
ing thé, ill-clads track on down . . . but, after observing the
-crowdythat nudged into Franklin Field last Saturday, we began
to understand what Olson meant’ when hevreferred to the real
track fan . . . and also comprehended why the two—day Carnival
was billboarded all around the Quaker City . . and why the first
place prizes, Elgin wrist watches and generous-sized plaques, are
that nice . . .

Track Addict Is Ardent ‘

Even a stranger phenomenon is the track addict himself . . . he
sits on the sidelines with a stop-watch and times each race for his
own satisfaction . . he is no more repressed ‘than the unihibited
football spectator . . although his manner of expression, while as
explosive as the gridiron attendant, is vent in a slightly diﬁerent
Jnanner . . . he jumps around waving his arms and wiggling in super-
accelerated Minsky fashion . . . but pipes out vocally only in a mild
manner . . conﬁning his audible expression to a vigorous hand-
-clapping when the particular performer passes his spot in the stands.

He talks through the day in tenths of seconds and back-stretch
kick vernacular . . and around Relay timetrack is all he talks
about . . most surprising is that in the East there is more than a
horde of this type of species C. . it is no small wonder that these
hinterlands are. considered the back-woods . . even though some of
the nation’s most talented cleatmen are nurtured here . .

=1: 

Most gratifying to those who highwayed down from the Cathe-
dral campus was the crowd sentiment for Pitt . . by the timt: the
mile relay approached, the Panthers were far and away the crowd’s
favorites . . . and the folks were not averse to making it known . . .
Olson claims that that same feeling was prevalent in Madison Square
Garden this winter . . . V '

  

Among the Panther trackmen of past years who turned up in
Philadelphia for the games were Wally Zieg, so-called father of Pitt
track, who Lincon-Zephyred some of the boys down . . ex-Pitt
‘track captains Fred Kiger and Bill Kellar were on the sidelines . . .
as was Pete Bowen who arrived just in time to see the mile relay
team . . Bowen, as is well-remembered, was the great one of Pitt
track until the modern era . . . he was one of the nation’s best quar-
ter milers around,’27 and ’28 . . . — ‘

‘Get Pitt’ Cry
Now Confronts
Olson Runners

‘With the headline ink‘ still
slightly damp and the memories
of last Saturday ’s sparkling
performance stillfresh the Pan
ther track squad heads west for
~EV,'£lI1StOn, Illinois, there to
lbrealk 't'a.'pe "thi1‘s*Saturd‘ay~ in a
Quadrangular meet with Pur-
due, Minnesota, and Northwestern.
From here on in every, team will
be out to “get Pitt” and if Olson
has anything to say about it, the

(latest reports hold that Olson has
plenty to say about it)

WEAK IN FIELD

Olson will take a large squad
to Evanston-, andthese Big Ten
schools will have sizeable outﬁts
on hand to try to upset the Pan-
ther applecart. Unlike the Penn
relays, the Quadrangular meet
will stress team results, and sec-
ond, thirds, fourths, and ﬁfths will
become highly important. The
Pitt team will probably . mix
enough places with their ﬁrsts to
come out with the chunkiest score.

This Pitt team has some world
beaters chugging around in uni-
form, but this Pitt team also has a
couple events in which they may
draw down goose eggs. The jav-
elin, the two mile run, and possi-
bly the mile run have nobody that
can step out and pick up some
pointage. Unless Ken Ryden is
back in competition the Panthers
will be weak at the hurdles.

Panther power lies in the sprints
and middle distances. Mason, Ohl,
and Routch are likely to blanket
the 100 and 220 yard dash. Mc-
Kee, Ferrara, and Woodruif are
likely to monopolize the quarter
mile, andstriding Johnny Wood-

. so it may be understandable how Olson joyed [ ruff and A1 McKee Wm ﬁnish the

when Moakley said to him after the meet, /‘Pitt is the best-condi— ' ha1f_mi1e’ 1_2_

‘tioned team entered here and one of the best-conditioned teams that
I have ever seen” . . this was very much of a laudation remarked
Bowen . . . being that lVloakley’s chief characteristic is taciturnity  .

Verbose has been the praise tossed to Johnny Woodruif and there
is no question that it is justly deserved . . but the worth of the
other Pitt relayers should not be forgotten and it will not be over-

looked, chieﬂy because of the mile relay race . . .

When Allen McKee kicked into the lead at the end of his quarter
with a time of 48.6 and gave the baton to Johnny three yards ahead
of the ﬁeld . . . it proved that Pitt was a team team . . ‘. with more
than one man . . . of course giving a lead to ‘Noodruif is like carry-
ing coals to Newcastle . . . but it brought a realization of the other
three men to the stands which was as it should be . . as Glenn
Cunninghamsaid after the race . . . “It takes a team to win a relay
race, and Pitt had the team.” . . .

BENNETT FAVOREI)

! Frank Ohl, Ed Routch, and Pete

Bennett will be the lads to out-
jump in the broad jump. Pete
Bennett and Red Oden will give
Pitt the edge in the high jump. V

Johnny Bazyk, Mike Radvan—
sky, Bud Hafer, and Harry Pom-

Nation’s Press Lauds Woodruﬁg

Wonders How Fast He

Can Run

I~leadlined' throughout. the’
nation’s press the past. week-
end was the Penn Relay feat of
Pitt’s one mile, half-mile, and
sprint. medley relay teams.

And most of that newspaper
wordage went to the anchor
man of those “get the baton to
Johnny” quartets, John Youie
Woodruﬂr‘, who, while he was only
one of the four—man team was
distinctly the most colorful and
most skillful performer.

HAD TO BE ‘GOOD

Said Jesse Abramson, the New
York Herald 'l‘ribune’s well-
known track critic, “Woodruif’s
return to world—record form for
the ﬁrst time since‘._he ran 1:47.8.,
for 800 metersilesis ﬁve feet, at the
Pan-American games in Dallas
last July". and his demonstrated
versatility were the highlights of
the two day Philadelphia meet . . .
Neither me distance nor the
weather made any difference to
Long John, as he produced his
three winning anchor leg per-
form ances 

“He ran an 880 on Friday in
1:49.9——th:-ee-tenths from the
world re«:ot.'-,d,--and followed on,
Saturday, w.ith a,fo.renoon furlong ,
in close to 53.1 flat and a late aft-
ernoon quarter in 47.4 seconds,
which represents close to world-
record speed around two turns.
Woodrurf had to_be aﬁre at Phil-
adelphia, fortothers ‘in races  ‘.,.-.__,_~,__

the Philadelphia Record, tapped a

when he led off with, “Long John?

The question that a track-mind-
ed nation now conjectures was ex-
pressed by Alan Gould, syndicate
writer, “Just how fast can Long
John run?”

‘This was put to Carl Olson, Pitt
track coach. Olson answered,
“God, I don’t know.”

A OLSON’S CHOICERIGHT

But an indirect answer was
given by Olson the morning of the
half-,mil’e rqlay race when he was
interrogated concerning his selec-
tion of Woodruﬁ as the anchor
man on that team which had each
man running 220-yards. He was
asked why he didn’t put Dick Ma-
son, the sprinter, in the anchor
position. N

§ ./.:;_*:,,f,,‘I_[ don’t want to waste John-

ny,” said Olson,"‘Runnihg in ahyi
other position on a staggered track
Johnny wouldn’ t realize how
»much behind or in front of
the other man he was, and con-
sequently wouldn’t run as fast.-
Johnny is a competitive runner.”

The sagacity, of Olson’s deci-
sion was borne out in the Pitt vic-
tory.

COMPETITIVE RUNNER

_Woodruff is .a competitive run-,
ner and he will“not run against‘
time. He runs just fast enough to

pacity.

W«ith the inauguration of the
football practice ﬁeld ‘diamond,
intra-n1ural.base_ball swings in.-
to a. full schedule today. V

This afternoon ’s tilts are the
ﬁrst games for all eight teams
scheduled.

The opening game on the
football practice ﬁeld will begin at
3:30 o’clock between the Cathe-
drals and the Phi Kappas. The
Phi Kaps include in their lineup
Ernie Bonelli, star frosh football-
er,’ who is ‘rumored’ to‘ be‘ quite a
slugger.

Following this clash, the Rover
Boys battle the Scrantonians.

FESTIVAL GAME

At 5 o’clock the Pharmacy team
from down on the bluff invades
the Stadium. The ROTC boys will
be their opponents (without guns).
Second scrap of the evening will
ﬁnd the Scotts against the College
outﬁt.

Tomorrow, as a Spring Festival
feature, the Rover Boys face the
Olsen Swedes, who already have a
victory to their credit. This is the
first time a baseball game has ever
been included in the Spring Fes-
tival celebration. All kin-ds of
extra frills have been promised
for the game, which starts at 2
o’clock, but no one seems to know
what they are going to be. All
of which means that the best thing
to do is to go up to the Stadium
tomorrow afternoon and ﬁnd out.

At 3:30 tomorrow, the Diablos
swing away at the Pitt Players at
the football practice ﬁeld. It will
be the Players’ ﬁrst match, though
the Diablos’ second. The once-
victorious Service 2 squad takes
on the Chemistry Seniors in the
day’s ﬁnal. .The Service crew
shapes up as a tough bunch to
beat.

MORNING GAMES

Friday will be the biggest day
of the season thus far. Contrary
to a printer’s error in the Monday
edition, the Olsen Swedes play the
Phys. Ed. Freshmen in a morning
game, and the Dithridge Aristo-
crats tackle the Frosh Footballers
during activity period. Both’
games are at the Stadium. Other
Stadium games ﬁnd the Pharmacy
team against the Bus Ad club at
3 o’clock with the ROTC—Pre Dent
and the Phi Kappa-Kappa Alpha
Phi games following.

Games at; the football practice
ﬁeld Friday  be the Stark
Sluggers versus the College at
3330, and the Chemistry Sopho-
mores battling Service 1 in the
second match.

Two other mistakes crept into
the schedule in the News on Mon-
day. The May 9 Phys. Ed. Sophs.-
Phys. Ed. Frosh game will be
played in the morning, and the
May 13 Starks-Cathedrals tangle
at activity period. '

SVVEDES VVIN

Last Monday’s games began
with a pitchers’ battle and ended
with a farce. With Powers yield-%
ing only one hit, a double by
Dickinson, the Olsens topped the
Pre-Dents 5-3. Winslow, Pre-Dent
chucker, gave up just ﬁve bingles
and fanned six, but heavy hitting

. by Zeleznick, who belted a double

and a single, and Radvansky, who
hammered out a homer and a dou-
ble, gave the Swedes the win.
Service 2 and the Chem Spe-,
cials were tied 3-3 after one in-*
ning, but the Service team blasted
out 10 tallies in the second to
eventually win 16-3 in a game
called at the end of the fourth on
account of darkness. The game
was counted as a full game by,
agreement of the rival _capta_ins.’

Pitt,Golf Team
Host To League
Foes This Week

With three warm-up matches
under their belt, their games
hitting a peak and their eyes on
t h e Eastern Intercollegiate
O 0 n f e r e n c e championship,
Pitt ’s golfers get down to
serious ..business this week—end
when they meet Penn State and
Cornell in conference matches
Friday and Saturday afternoon at
the Field Club.

The matches will be part of a
round-robin, Cornell and Penn
State meeting Saturday morning
on the same course.

Cornell will be the doubtful
quantity when the teams meet,
the Panther having beat the Nit-
tany Lions already, 6-3, at State
College, Pa., last week-end.

The “Big Red” team was upset
in a close match, 5-4, last season
by a less experienced Panther
team than will take to the fair-
days next Saturday. It was the
only match won by the Pitt golf-
ers in conference competition last
year.

Pitt’s chances for the confer-
ence championship are better this
year. With the addition of the
par-smashing Barrett Melvin and
the tournament—wise senior,
George Simpson, the
linksmen are better balanced.

Number one and two men, Sou-
chak’ and Kaye, have won all their
matches this season, Kaye contin-
uing his consistent work of last
year when he only dropped one
match.

Melvin and Daddio, at numbers
three and four, are putting these.
positions almost on a par with the
ﬁrst two slots with their sensa-
tional play so far. Daddio, a ter-
riﬁc hitter oif the tee, has straight-
ened out his drives this season to
become a standout.

WICHITA, Kan.-—-(ACP)—One

of college students that is not

age collegian sleeps 56 hours
every week.

At least those are the facts de-
termined by the University of
Wichita education class of Dean
L. I-Iekhuis.

“The tabulation showed,” the
survey -report said, “that the per-
son working the most hours
studies the most. One student
works 50 hours in a local dry
goods store and spends 26 hours
in studying. On the other hand a
girl sleeping 60 hours, does no
outside work and studies but 10
hours.”

Another conclusion drawn from
the compilation was that the stu-
dent who sleeps the least ‘spends
the most" time studying.
