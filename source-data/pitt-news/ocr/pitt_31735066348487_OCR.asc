One-thousand twenty-eight
scoops of ice cream were consumed
by 15 fraternity and sorority
members in an Ice Cream Eating
Contest held yesterday to raise
money for the Western Pennsyl-
vania Heart Fund.

Individual fraternities and soror-

In ‘his report .to the__ Senate

unchanged. The Governor's budget
is in the ﬁnal stages of preparation
and we will be informed of the

Abortion Advocate

BY HARRIS LEVY
Student Government (SG) Presi-
dent Larry Platt has not resolved
his doubts about dormitory-room
increases, but the Resident Student
Association (RSA) feels room and

. board increases are justiﬁed.

Platt, SG Board member Dan
Stifﬂer, and his assistant Greg
Glister met with Director of Uni-
veristy Housing and Food Services
Tom Albert and Associate Director
of University Housing Don Hughes
Tuesday afternoon to discuss the

rate increases. The increases were

also discussed at an RSA meeting
Tuesday evening which Platt, Glis-
ter, Albert,- and Hughes also
attended.

Effective Fall Term 1975, dorm
room rates will be hiked $20 per
term while meal ticket fees will be
raised $14 to $45, depending on the
plan selected.

Platt said he didn’t question ,the
board increases but several points
concerning room rate hikes must
still be clarified. “I respect the

on a woman’s right for abortion as
part of the Student Union Board’s

Press International. It was the
1972 case of Baird vs Massachu-
setts that eventually led to the
repeal of US abortion laws.

“We will lose the abortion law in
tw/o to three years by what I would
call benign neglect,” Baird
claimed, unless a concerted public
effort was made to prevent their

judgement of the RSA but I still
have a few questions of my own,”
he said.

The revenues the housing ofﬁce
receives from the’ rental of store-..
fronts under quad dorms is one
area Platt intends to investigate
further. “Albertsaid that 15% of
the housing budget was from
storefronts but Hughes admitted
he didn't know if the rents were
going to be raised like dorm rates,”
Platt said.

Platt also voiced questions about
the Housing 0ffice’s reasons for
the room increase as stated on their
recent mailing to dorm students. “I
still have trouble with decreased‘
labor, decreased services and in-.
creased costs,” he explained.

The RSA feels the increases are I,

justified, according to Jim Dato-
vech, RSA Chairman. “We’re
planning a mass mailing to student
mail boxes probably early ‘next
week explaining our views. ’

“As far as the Housing Ofﬁce and
the Office of Residence Life (ORL)
are concerned, they’ve kept us up
to date as to what was going on,”
Datovech said.

Datovech added the RSA would 5 ‘

have liked to meet with Vice
Chancellor of Business and Finance ,

increases were decided. Jeff Chaby
of the RSA and [former Student
Government President] Mike Fur-

said Dan Lieﬁeld, who is heading
the drive with Sharon Mandel and
Michele DeJean. C

“We chose‘ the Heart Fund for our
charity drive this year because all
the money raised will go back into
research at Pitt, marked as a
contribution from Pitt Greeks,”
DeJean said.

Trophies from the Heart Fund will
be awarded to the three groups that
raise the most money per member.
In addition, two Roberto Clemente
awards will be presented to the
fraternity and sorority contributing
the largest amounts to the fund.
All the awards will be made at a

Mideast Peace Possible

A BY BILL MOORE

Chances are excellent for a peace
settlement in the Mideast if Egypt
goes into the present peace
conferences with as much “ﬂexi-
bility” as Israel, Israeli Consul
General Emanuel Shimoni said
here last night.

Shimoni is responsible for per-
forming ambassadorial duties and
representing the Israeli viewpoint
in Pennsylvania and the surround-
ing states. He is one of eight
Consul Generals stationed in
various parts of the United States,
in addition to the Israeli Embassy
in Washington. v- ’

Shimoni appeared on campus in
an Israel Week conference with
representatives of the Post Gaz-

ette. the Jewish Chronicle, KDKA,

radio and the Pitt News.

“From my knowledge of the
Israeli position, Israel is going out
of its way to be moderate and
ﬂexible,” Shimoni said of the
present talks between Secretary of

State Henr.y._I_{iss_inger ,and_I,srael_ I

,'r_ 7. r_'.'A 1

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Shimoni said Israel is now in a

good position — to bargain with" -
Egypt. “We have a lot of real '

estate, and ‘it is all available in
order to bargain,” he said. “And
we are militarily stronger than ever
before.”
He dismissed reports claiming.

Egypt was not ready tocooperatein
peace negotiations._ “When you
start off, you put forward your
extreme position, but when you

ﬁnally sit down at the table, you . ' U
‘ put on an air of ﬂexibility. It is like ‘

labor and management negotia-
tions in this country,” Shimoni
explained. 4 A
“In return for non-belligerence,’ a V

cease-fire for a protected period of
a number of years, and a stop of the
economic boycott of Israel, we are
prepared to give back territory,"
Shimoni said, “and the amount of
territory will depend on the amount
of non-belligerence.” ‘ '

lecture tour citing “personal

Although Ziegler had called off
his tour, which was to begin
February 19 and included a Pitt
speech February 24, he has begun
rescheduling some of the cancella-
tions through his New York agent,
C. William Leigh.

Wendy Traub, the spokesman,
said last night that the Program-
ming Committee unanimously
voted to reinvite Ziegler, and had
contacted Leigh Bureau to re-
schedule the appearance.

“We really wanted to bring him
” explained Traub. “Mostly

e * Because of all the hassles its

created so far.”

The Programming Committee had
delayed signing the original con-
tract with Ziegler’s agent until the
Student Government Board en-
dorsed the invitation because some

\ students had objected to it. They

contended Ziegler should not be
allowed to proﬁt from his role in the
Watergate affair.

Traub explained that a new
contract will not be signed, but
rather the original one will be
altered to include the new date.

The Committee will not take the
ofﬁcial action until next Tuesday,
so Jack Brown, the group’s advisor

who is out of town, will be able to .

approve the arrangement.
Because it was the Furick
administration which endorsed the
original Ziegler invitation, the new
Student Government President
Larry Platt who once protested the

Ziegler lecture was asked if his
administration would take further
action.

“Because the agreement has not
been cancelled, but only changed, I
don't think there is anything we
can do about it,” Platt said. “And
speaking for myself, I’m not going
to press the issue anymore.”

If the contract is ﬁnalized Tuesday
as planned, Ziegler’s appearance
will be the same as was scheduled
for February 24. It will include a
day of speaking to various classes,

and the Press” in David Lawrence

tance of student involvement. If
you givethe students the_ facts,
they’ll understand them. ”

According to the Housing Office
statement, the $20 room rate hike
includesapproximately $9 for in-
creased utility cost, $6 for in-
creased labor cost, and $5 for
increased supplies and other costs.
“The increased utility costs are
electricity and hot water,” Dato-
vech said.

Hughes noted last year over
$50,000 in Housing Office -revenue
was lost in bad debts caused by
students who failed to pay their
bills.

Under questioning by Platt in the

‘Tuesday RSA meeting, Albert clar-

iﬁed the Housing Office state-

~ment’s ‘assertion student housing

and food services receive no opera-
tional subsidy.

Datovech noted that all dorms are
still mortgaged. “The people who
live here have to pay them off,” he
said.

Expenses for malicious damage,
which total $18,000 so far this year,
are absorbed in other areas of the
budget, or in two instances passed
on to dorm floors involved under a
pro-rating, plan where they share

the bill, Albert said.

Snyder said services in the dormi-
tories. were cut back or altered to
prevent costs from skyrocketing as
an outcome of the strike. Noting
that maid service is now monthly
instead of biweekly, he said, “it’s
more important to cover the com-
mon areas than individual rooms.”
Since the summer, Albert said 20
employees were laid off and 8 were
recalled later. H

Increased labor costs account for
over half the meal ticket increase,
according to the housing office
statement. ' _

Contracts for MCNR workers, who
are University employees, and
workers in other dorms, who are
Szabo Food Service employees,
were negotiated separately. The
MCNR employees got a recent
raise, plus increased fringe bene-
ﬁts, with a $.20 an hour boost to
come in January. Szabo employees
will get a $.25 increase in July, with
a $.50 hike to follow in March of

1976, according to Greg Glister 7

who attended the afternoon meet-
ing. , ‘

Food cost increases were cited by
Albert at the RSA meeting. “We
counted for a 15% increase in food
costs but they actually went up
21%,” Albert said. ‘

The Consul General welcomed the
prospects of a Geneva Peace
Conference in the future, he said,
but not until both sides are ready.
“To go to Geneva without ﬁrst
laying the groundwork would result
in a worse situation than we have at
the moment,” Shimoni said.

He suggested the present Kissin-
ger visit along with the ﬁnal visit
scheduled for March could lay that
groundwork.

Shimoni was asked about a‘ recent
statement by Egyptian ambassador
Anwar Sadat that, if no real
progress is made in peace
negotiations in April, he “did not
like to contemplate what might
Shimoni replied he
hoped Sadat was “wise enough not
to talk himself into a corner where
war was necessary.” He added
“bombastic threats” were not rare
from Sadat. _ ‘

The Israeli Consul General said
the government of Israel has
expressed trust in Kissinger,
although he was unsure of the
views of the Israeli public.

He declined to comment on the
possibility of preemptive air strikes

on Syria to interfere with the
country's arms build-up, saying
“that is a decision that is purely
tactical and military.” ‘
Shimoni’s visit was sponsored by
B‘nai Brith Hillel as part of Israel

Thursday.

I have taken budget cuts, with the exception of faculty salaries, which

have absorbed most of the department’s 31% budget increase over the

last three years. _ _
Thefundingfor'I‘heatre Arts productions, which Matthews mamtains

7 ins beencut less thanother areas, is suﬁering, nevertheless. So is this

situationvitalenoughtowarrantspecialaction?_. _
According to Theatre Arts Coordinator Attilio Favorim, the problem 18

“benign neglect” by the University. Piecemeal help in the face of ‘

crises is valuable, but simply not enough. And, because of the
skyrocketing prices of lumber and other supplies, theatre productions
are especially vulnerable to inﬂation. _ _

The result of this situation, according to Favorini, is a situation of
diminishing returns where eventually student and faculty eﬂort will

» simply die out due to overwork and lack of support. T
-' This mist not be allowed to happen.

Theatre production programs at this University are vitally important
to more than just theatre majors. But students here should be of
primary importance to the administration. And if they are, neglecting
the one organization on campus which provides these students with a

. practical application of their academic learning is turning a deaf ear to

the facts of life. This University may never become career-oriented,
but it should not go to the extent of preventing students from utilizing
their talents. p ' .
Another justiﬁcation for the existence of a strong Theatre Arts
program at Pitt is responsibility to the larger community. Presently,
Pittsburgh has virtually no professional theatre. That gap needs to be
ﬁlled, for the beneﬁt of all residents of the area. And since the
;Uiiiversity is continually aware of strained relations with the Oakland‘

A . cormnunity, ignoring a group which, unlike Camegie-Mellon’s theatre
arts, provides a service to that community, is bad public relations.

Perhaps the answer to these problems is to create an independent
theatre arts department with its own substantial fimding from both-

.I internal and external sources. We are not qualiﬁed to make
' judgment. But we see clearly that the administration needs to make a

priority reevaluation and admit the invaluable contributions of Pitt’s
theatre production programs to the school, the students and the
‘community.

Greek Charity

Campus Greeks deserve a respectful pat on the back for the
enthusiastic effort displayed in the opening activities of the Heart Fund

The ultimate goal for this year’s drive is at least $25,000. The money

Move to Mexico

Symp toms of Big 0rack- up

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Never before have Americans
labored under the guilt which is
presently crushing this country.
The President tells us that inﬂa-

tion (make that recession) is the p

fault of the greedy consumer. Big
Business tells us unwise spending
on products they advertise is
undermining the economy. Most of
us voted for Nixon. Our ancestors
killed Indians, enslaved blacks and
sacked Rome.

Well, the Big Crack-up has come.

.More and more Americans are

succumbing to new strains of
bizzare mental illnesses, and the
following are just a few. If
symptoms persist, move to.Mexico.

1) Hassman’s Syndrome: the
victim can be found slouched in any
bar in your city, muttering over and
over. “It’s okay, everything’s okay.
It’s okay, everything’s great.”
Hassman’s Syndromers have been
known to lapse into ﬁts of
snickering, piques of violence and
frequent buying sprees. Shock
therapy has proven partially
effective when combined with
psycho-tropic drugs.

2) Partial Personality Suppres-
sion: The victim will consistently
deny he voted for Nixon, or is even
a citizen of the United States.
Naturally the struggle with his
consciousness emerges in strange
lapses in which the victim will
attempt to climb buildings, make
strange, disconnected comments
on football games, or pretend he’s

an Indian.

3) Tremens Mimicus: The person
involved will convince himself he is
a rock, tree, Cadillac or some other
inanimate object (sometimes cans
of deodorant).
but patient handling by relatives
and professionals have stabilized
victims from further aberrant
behavior. For instance, one man in
California, convinced he was a
rock, tried to cement himself into a
patio-wall. Thanks to treatment
(which didn’t cost peanuts, buddy)
he is now leading a happy life as a
doorstop in his own home.

4) Krenkle’s Complex: Convinced
he is a bomb, the victim will stand
in crowded subways or in restau-
rants with. a smirk on his face
and‘ suddenly yell words like

“Boom! You’re all dead!” or
‘ ‘Ballaam! You’re blown to
smithereens. ’ ’ I

S) Simon’s Aberration: Victims

-are convinced they are highly-

trained bomb squad members, and
will prowl cities for hours seeking
victims of the Krenkle’s Complex,
attempting to disarm them by
unscrewing their noses. Harmless
but disturbing, these bright-eyed
folks have been known to engage in
ﬁghts with Krenkle Complexers for
days.

6) Paranoia Ultimasc Those in this
victim suffers from a split
personality, one of which is a
hypothetical agent of the CIA.
People under this stress tend to
compile massive dossiers on
themselves, and report daily to

There is no cure, ’

“mythical” bureau chiefs, make
invisible ink from milk and lemon
juice and refuse to talk about their
actions because they are “conﬁ-
dential.” The critical stage comes
with the inevitable command from
“HQ” to liquidate the “suspect.” -
It is suggested all mirrors be
removed from the home, ward or
cell.

8) Presidential Coma: The victim
becomes convinced he is ‘the
President of the United States, and
undertakes policie to “turn this
country around,” policies which
are changes from day to day from
inﬂation to recession to insurrec-
tion. Basically harmless, the only
known cure is to encourage the
patient in his delusions until his
term of ofﬁce expires.

9)T‘ermina_l__ Tranquility: One of
the most widespread and deadly of .
the mushrooming mental illnesses,
the victim of Terminal Tranquility
feels and acts perfectly normal.
He/ she will attend to a normal
daily routine, say average things,
do averagevacts. The only key is a
weird, glistening smile which never
leaves their faces. The scope of this
particular disease is not known at
this time, although experts believe
(when they’re not smiling) that it
has reached epidemic proportions
in this country. Although the
upshot of this illness is not known,
some have speculated the victim
becomes more and more tranquil
until in the ﬁnal stage»his/ her heart
stops. '

Black ‘Privileges’ Debated

Dance Marathon:

New Discrimination.

Dear Editor,

My immediate response to the
letter published in the Feb. 7
edition concerning equal rights or
special privileges was that its
author had ﬁnally come face to face
with discrimination. If the dance
marathon was indeed “ﬁxed”
against whites because the judges
and referees were predominately
black then R. L. Kardos has had his
ﬁrst experience {with the type of
treatment that blacks have had to
combat for over 200 years. But the
discrimination that blacks have
come up against have included
things which are more important
and essential to their well being
than a simple dance marathon.
Blacks have been beaten, jailed,
lynched and denied every conceiv-
able “privilege” that exists. These
“privileges” have included not
only the right to vote but the
humiliation of Jim Crow legislation
which segregated everything from
buses to bathrooms. Because of the
‘color of their skins blacks have had
to settle for second class houses,
jobs, and educations. Ghetto
schools are not only overcrowded
and understaffed but also lack the
educational facilities of many
suburban white schools. As a result
many blacks have received an
education that is not up to par with
many whites. ,
If it Is true that this university has
a policy which lowers its admission
standards for blacks [and I ﬁnd this
questionable] it can only be
considered a small attempt to
compensate for an inferior educa-
tion which began for many blacks
as far back as grade school. The
only University program which to
my knowledge takes this difference
in educational experience for
granted is the UCEP program
which attempts to make up for
deficiencies that lie not in the

student and" his capabilities but in
the educational experience of
which he is a product.

It is impossible for me to believe
that Mr. Kardos came to this
university “unprejudiced.’;’ Any-
one who truly believes that he can
“learn about black culture ﬁrst

hand” by living with and being"

exposed to one black person

doesn’t come under my deﬁnition 7

of unprejudiced. How many of us
can ‘truly say that we are
completely free of biases?

Iﬁnd it somewhat ironic that Mr. I

Kardos feels oppressed and angry
because of the judging of a dance
marathon when blacks feel the
same oppression and anger on a
more intense scale almost everyday
of their lives.

Mr. Kardos ends his letter saying
that he is not opposed to equal
rights and that. perhaps white
students need a White Action
Society to assure them equal
rights. In my estimation what he
was really trying to say is that
white students on campus should
be allowed to maintain their
superiority over blacks and other
minorities. If the dance marathon
had been won by a white couple
and had been judged by a
predominately (white committee
with perhaps one “token” black I
wonder how Mr. Kardos would
have reacted.

Dance Marathon
Results Defend ed

To the Editor:
In response to the letter that

appeared Friday, Feb. 7, in the

Letters to the Editor column.

Mr. Kardos gives much claim to
the fact that he was such an angel
when he came to Pitt that he wasn't
even prejudiced towards black
people, but now that he has learned
that blacks receive “special privil-
eges” he has become a full-ﬂedged

WV

a4--.-..

p

prejudiced person. Well, I say" "
hooray for Mr. Kardos. .

As one of the referees in the dance
marathon and a past contestant, I,
too, could predict the winner of the
marathon as couple #29, not
because they were black .or
sponsored by BAS, but because of

all the qualities that ‘each ' judge

looked for, namely style, endur-.
ance, creativity and partnership,
they were obviously the best. He
claims‘ that anyone could see that
they were the obvious winners
because of all the black referees
and judges. That’s not true, “
because for one thing, the referees
had no say in ‘who won ﬁrst,
second, third, etc., and another, if
anyone watched the entire mara-
thon, he would have seen that most
of the white couples were doing
nothing short of scraping their
feet back and forth across the ﬂoor
and that deﬁnitely shows no
creativity or style, unless you are ,
using the standards of an insane
person. -

I might also add that of the 50-60 0
odd couples at the start of the
marathon, only one was asked to
leave--and they were black!

It seems that as long as the whites
are up front running and winning
everything, they are satisﬁed, but
just let. a black win something as
insigniﬁcant as a marathon and
people like Mr. Kardos and his
sore-losing roommate start crying
like babies‘. ‘

Mr. Kardos cries special privil-
eges and I say you damn right,
after all your ancestors kept the
regular privileges from our ances-
tors for over 400 years; it’s time
you started paying your debts! I

It’s time for people like Mr.
Kardos both black and white to get p
out of their diaper and baby bottle
period and stop crying so much
over wet diapers and spilled milk!

Racism Charged
in Kardos Letter

To the Editor:

/'-.( Dear Mr. R. L. Kardos,

)\‘We all know white people can’t

dance! I distinctly remember the
last dance marathon that was held
where there were white judges,
white referees, and white winners,
so what's your beef.
SPECIAL PRIVILEGES

How absurd and how ignorant of
you, Mr. Kardos. White people
have been since they indoctrinated
themselves into thinking they are
Gods, have had nothing but some
special ‘privileges. This whole
University is a WHITE special
privilege. Where white people live
are specially privileged places,
where they eat are special

" ,-E «privileges. Mr. Kardos, you are full

 

of garbage. Poor thing! Why don’t
some you white greedy vultures
give up some of your political,
ﬁnancial, and psychological bene-
ﬁts and privileges? Privileges you
have awarded yourself for ages at
the expense of people of COLOR. I
agree we should stop giving special
privileges to white people simply
because they’re white.

Check yourself out, Mr. Kardos,
your inhumanity is showing.

Dear Editor: p .

, it means.

 

Pitt, and I would like to continue
the letter from “R.L. Kardos” but
with my own observations and
thoughts.

I have seen my professor “back-
off” from an argumentative black
student; I’ve never seen him adopt
that attitude with the white stu-
dents in our class.

I attended the “Angela Davis”
speech and was subjected to the

’ arrogant antics of a young, black
“punk” on stage. I don’t use that --

term loosely, because whites have
been called “punks” for years
without starting a- riot. This boy
struttedon stage waving his hands,
and bellowed his orders intq the
microphone to the audience and
incoming people. If that had been
my son on stage, I would have
slapped his face in ‘front of every-
one and told him to stop making an
ass out of himself and others. I was
surprised that not one ofﬁcial Pitt
representative tried to maintain
some decorum in that hall—if only
for Ms. Davis’ sake.

Quite a few of the black students
at Pitt are not accepting “Equal-
ity. ” Maybe they don’t'know what
It means you are
equal—not' better; rules that apply

to the white student applies to the
black student and VICE-VERSA.

Who gave them the right to rebel
with violence the Pitt policies that
white students have accepted or, if

you wish, “tolerated” all these,

years; if they wanted to alter Pitt
policies they shouldn’t have hu-
miliated a teacher by seizing him
and riding herd on him in an
elevator.

The young, black students are
carelessly abusing the “Equality”
their ancestors fought for. They
are infecting hatred,’ fear and
threat of violence into the veins of
the whites.

I feel sorry for some of the fine,
intelligent, gentle, black class-
mates I have had the joy of
knowing; their honor has been
tarnished because of the some-
times primitive and capricious ac-
tions of their “brothers.”

I, for one, feel the black students
are attempting to by-pass “Equal-
ity” for —-— “SUPREMACY."

Respectfully,
Ms. Phillips

Baird Accuses church

(Continued from Page 1)

He sought opposition to the
proposed ‘Constitutional amend-
ment reinstating the abortion laws
and support for the Supreme Court
repeal decision. '

Shortly before the ﬁrst of two
scheduled‘ lectures on the Pitt
campus, Baird revealed he had
come to Pittsburgh to assist a local
woman in her struggle to receive
aid for her child allegedly fathered
by a priest of Pittsburgh's
Byzantine archdiocese.

Charging “blatant sexism is
rampant throughout organized
religion” and condemning the
political arm of the Catholic
religion for its anti-abortion posi-
tion, Baird promised to help the
woman seek ﬁnancial support of
the child from the Pittsburgh
diocese. Father Robert Paul
Hubbell, ordained Byzantine Rite
priest in the Pittsburgh diocese, is

charged with fathe‘ring a mongoloid‘

daughter, Dawn Lynn, to one of his
parishoners four years ago, and
subsequently moving to Canada to
avoid supporting the child, accord-
ing to Baird.

The couple married secretly, and
at the request of Father Hubbell,
both the mother and daughter
assumed the surname “Hubal.”

,  h

The priest was later transferredtby
the Pittsburgh Byzantine archdio-

cese to the diocese of Saskatche,--A '

wan, Canada.

Labelling the case a “Vatican , A
conspiracy” for the lecture aud- . ' ‘
ience, Baird asserted this is the“ 

of‘ I. .. ,.
campaigning for women's rights, .
that he ha documented proof to ”

first time in 12 years

support such a paternity suit. '
Baird is prepared to -present
photostatic reproductions of the

 

  
 
 

couple’s marriage certiﬁcate and  , 

the infant’s birth an baptismal
records, as well as transcripts of a

taped conversation between the‘

priest and the baby’s mother and

testimony from Mrs. Hubal’s 

20-year-old daughter Diane stating 0. ’ -1:

the priest had spend several nights
at the Hubal home.

A court order already stands  
against the priest requiring him to ’ 

pay $200 a month in child support.

Mrs. Hubal thus far has received A

only one offer of $3000 for lifetime

support of the child from the priest “'

according to Baird.

Baird's plans to aid Mrs. Hubal

are presently tenuous, but con-
tends establishing _a defense fund
for her case is the
possibility.

"Donald Hower stood on his port-

directed the cadence of the band,

siniled as he jiggled his baton

“We have a show to put together

ganization and discipline. We have

Several students help with the
uniforms, instruments and repairs,
and the other small jobs that must

Hower structures his practice
sessions as strictly as he structures
the hierarchy’ of the people who
wear band jackets. There is a time
for warm-up, a time for marching,
a time for music, and a time for
announcements and other busi-
ness. When the practice is ﬁnished

and the band reassembles in the »

The band ﬁnished the song and
the director dropped his hands to
signal the instruments back into
resting position. He came onto the
field and the assistants began
shouting directions for the next
formation.

“Like I was saying, we have a lot .

of fun here. Most of the band
members have homework and

other activities so the band can't

But, the kids like it here and we get
it together. The band really likes to
work.”

Many of the older band members
know that in the three years Don
Hower has been at Pitt, he has

consistently spoken out for the '

band in squabbles with the admin-
istration. But, he would like to
change some of the traditions and
direct the programs the way he
wants them directed. '

No scholarships are awarded by
Pitt’s varsity marching band and
only a handful of its members are
music majors. According to Hower,
the Ohio State marching band has
150 members--all on scholarship--
and 50 music majors. The Pitt band

Don Hower recruits his own band

fruit of lithe female gingko tree,-.

 

when squashed, emits a pungent
odor which smells like, "at best,

“Where did these herbacious

come from?” you might or might
not ask. That’s a very interesting
question. Actually, the gingko is
considered a living fossil, with
ancestral traces dating back mil-
lions of years.

’ ADAY IN THE LIFE OF A VICTIM

The typical Victim of the cunning
gingko berry is a student like you or
me. Never imagining the fate that
awaits him, he parks his car under
the branches of what appears to be
an insigniﬁcant, almost stately-
looking tree. Weary from lack of
sleep, fearful from lack of study,

the Victim high-steps onto the
sidewalk with his new platform
shoes, thinking of nothing but
‘differential equations and the

thoughts are nowhere near the

the ground, and they know. it. The
gingko berries strike.

“Smussh.” Quickly the powerful
odor rises to the Victim's nostrils,
and nearly overcomes him. He
ﬁghts for air and holds his knotted
stomach. A surge of adrenalin
allows him to dash into the
gingko-less street, or there would

‘doubtlessly be an equally foul-

smelling orange puddle keeping
theberries company.

Dodging cars, shouting obsceni-

suspiciously down the middle of the
street, kicking his shoes up
occasionally, like a dog covering his
mess, in a desperate attempt to rid
himself of the stenching pieces of
fruit. .

He ﬁnally makes it to the
Cathedral, and nervously wisks
through the revolving door, where
he is greeted by a few friends.
“Hey, what’s up?” somebody
says, and slaps him on the back.
The Victim scurries past them into
the hall, and leaves behind an
invisible vapor-like trail. Suddenly,
noses begin to twitch, lips curl in
disgust, and the crowd disperses.

When the Victim ﬁnally returns to
his car a half hour later, he is
padding along in his stocking feet,
muttering through his teeth. His
only consolation is that it might
take his professor a while to locate
the source of the peculiar smell
emanating from the shoes he left
behind. '

THE GINGKO AN ANSWER TO
THE FOOD SHORTAGE?

You may be tempted to run out
with an axe and wildly chop down
some gingko trees. But before you
do anything rash, I should point out
that these trees may be the solution
we’re looking for to stave off
widespread starvation due to
inﬂation.

On dreary afternoons you can
often see aging Chinese ladies

gathering the fruit in buckets. A
strange form of Chinese maso-
chism? I called a local Oriental
restaurant to ﬁnd out. _

I carefully explained that I was
inquiring about the use of the fruit
borne by the gingko tree, but the
lady in charge had no idea what I
was talking about. Unintentionally,
I mentioned “foul odor,” and the
owner immediately perked up.
“Ohh. We call it Stinky Tree. Oh
yes: We make soup with stinky
balls. It costs $2.00 a pound in
store.”

To make sure I wasn’t responsible
for food poisoning any readers, I
went home and made some stinky
ball soup myself. To tell you the
truth, it was pretty good.

Collect a bag full of ginkgo
berries, optionally sporting another
paper bag over your head (This
serves the dual purpose of hiding
your face and protecting your nose
from the overwhelming smell).

Carefully carry home. Get a
knife and slice off the stinky fruit,
which will leave you with the hard
brown stinky ball inside. Continue
to wear paper bag.

Take all the stinky fruit and put it
in a neighbor’s garbage can. You
now have a pile of stinky balls.
Wash them off and, “ah-so,” the
stinky balls no longer stinky. You
can remove the paper bag.

Boil in water for twenty minutes.
Let cool for a few minutes, and

  

crack open the hard brown shells.
Inside is a greenish fruit the size of
a pistachio nut. Pop one in your
mouth.

Not bad, is it? It tastes something
like a little potato, only better.
Crack open the rest.

Now you're all set to make soup.
Mix them into a broth, adding
mushrooms and waterchestnuts,
for the real Chinese effect. Or take
the lazy man's way out. Dump into

a pot of Lipton’s onion soup. Eat,

hearty.

A review is a review is a review. No way. No, I'm not going to tell
anyone to pack this column up their ass, but after doing this for a year
and a half, I’d like to share my thoughts on reviews of different art
forms. is

Reviewing a hook is not like reviewing a record. Or a play. Or a__
movie. ‘Each has its advantages and drawbacks.

The tangibility of books are their big plus. You can always go back
and reread a passage or if you’re not hung over from the night before '
you can even dig up more works by the same author.
~ This great advantage is also a big drawback. Over the years a lot of .
people have written a lot of books (If you don’t believe me check out
Hillman Library). Try as you may, it’s impossible to keep up with all of
literary history or even all good contemporary writing. It’s a shame i
too, because in the process, you’re probably missing some good
parallels. _ _

Book reviews have respectability but reviews of rock records probably . __
-interest a lot more readers. So while there's no New York Review of x  
Records, there are lots of folks who crave Elton John’s every utterance. F 

Rock has the advantage of "a short history. It’s possible to be '
reasonably knowledgeable about the rock past and the oldies
phenomena keeps it in the present. Movie stars or authors just don’t .
make comebacks like Chuck Berry did.

Movies are similar to rock in that they have a short history and an
available past. But while most rock is in English, many good ﬁlms are
foreign. Foreign ﬁlms lose a lot with subtitles and dubbing and are
frequently unavailable. .

Movies are expensive to make. Thus, unlike most books, the work of
an artist will, be mangled for commercial purposes. Certainly other i 
_artist_s have faced problems, but few can match the tragic careers of '_ 
ﬁlm’s Orson Welles, Buster Keaton and Erich von Stroheim. Since’ ' A ' *
there are more people involved in a ﬁlm than a book or record, it’s hard"
to untangle the creative contributionsof each individual. V

UP Gallery Perfectly Located

BY B. LAMBL

Strategically located on the
corner of Forbes and Bouquet
Streets, the UP Gallery invites
serendipitous detours from a day’s
routine. That’s its virtue as an art
gallery. lt’s not a place you make
plans to go to and where you count
on spending an afternoon. You just
drop in. It's right there onythe way
to practically anywhere, and it
takes no more than three minutes
to case the exhibit and see if it’s
worth staying for.

The Gallery moved from the Frick
Fine Arts Building to its current
location a year ago, and it’s the
best ‘thing that could have
happened to it. Out on the street it
better serves its dual purpose. It
lets the public see what’s being
done currently, and it gives the
Studio Arts Department a chance to

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

A baby is kidnapped in the dead of
night from her parents’ home... '
This sensational happening hits the
newspapers...A ransom is paid...
The baby is murdered anyway. —

Thus, in a fast-paced manner
bearing parallels to the 1932 kid-

_ napping-murder of Charles Lind-

bergh, Jr., begins Murder’ On The
Orient Express--the ﬁlm based on
the 1934 Agatha Christie novel.

After this intro comes the gist of O
the movie that takes place aboard "

the Orient Express ‘en route from
Istanbul to Calais five years after
the. kidnapping-murder of _Daisy,
Armstrong. Aboard the train are 13
people, one of which gets mur-
dered for some past even and 12 in
which one may be connected with ,
this murder on the train and the
Armstrong kidnapping-murder.
Now enters Agatha Christie’s
hero Hercule Poirot (played out-

, standingly by Albert Finney), who

sets about to solve the mystery in
one of the best “whodunits” ever
ﬁlmed. ‘

In addition, the picture boasts an
all star cast who make much more
than cameo appearances. The cast
consists of Albert Finney, Anthony

Perkins, John Gielgud, Lauren .

Thirty to forty people a day go

students and friends of the artists.
But they are also people waiting for

“Orient Express” Acting
Most Impressive Aspect

essa Redgra__ve. _ L

They are all superb from begin-
ning to end and watching them
alone is worth the admission price.

Each star is “introduced” as he or
she board the train and “reintro-
duced” at the ﬁlm's conclusion.
Most of the stars seem to do
take-offs of their earlier'perform-
ances. Sean Connery, who plays a

.military, officer, acts his role with ’

the arrogance and macho he had as
James Bond.‘ Lauren Bacall who
plays a brash, talkative widow was‘
reminiscent of her role in Harper,
while the neurotic‘ Anthony Perkins
behaved like was still in Psycho.

‘ For Connery, working on the ﬁlm ‘

must have given him a sense of
deja vu since it has been 11 years
whenrhe was first in Istanbul and
boarded the Orient Express as
agent 007 in From Russia With
Love.

It is also a pleasure to see stars
like Lauren Bacall and Vanessa
Redgrave sitting and dining in the
background when scenes move to
the dining car-~a small observation

_that adds to the craftsmanship of

the movie.

And the direction of this acting by
Sidney Lumet contains perfect
timing and craftmanship which

onto the floor. If you go in and step
on its tail, it wheels convulsively
and jiggles its spines. This is the
work of Francis M. Foley in stuffed
vinyl. His design emerged, he
explains, “from a fascination with
both modern technology and ‘the
ever present organic forms of
plants and animals.” He began by
painting these organic forms, but

' switched to vinyl sculpture when

the fascination was not satisﬁed
with just looking. His objects now
“seek to be touched, moved and

manipulated.” The kinetic‘ sculp-

tqres buy their mechanism  folds
of vinyl. But the curious hand is
drawn to the hidden button by the
bright patch that usually covers it.

Objects serve as a iumping-off
point for two other artists in the
show. Barbara W. Holt focuses on

organic, while Sara S. Heston on

architectural forms. Holt moves
from the observation of color and
texture inside fruit to the relation of
the two in their transcription on
canvas. Heston, on the other hand,

begins by observing the fragmen-

tation of spacefin architecture. She
goes beyond this. to abstract
delimitations of space. One paint-
ing, “R.D. # 2,”, is especially
fascinating because it shows the
progressive abstraction from land-
scaped space to rudimentary

_color-and-form space.

Jean S. Rob] is one artist there
who deals purely in medium. She
has chosen to work with ﬁbrous
cloth. She wanted, -“a ﬂexible
system” that wouldrallowher “to
change and observ.e the relation-
ship of color, pattern, form, line,
space, light.” She dyes the cloth,

_ lets it run, then drapes and lights

it. The compound effect is often
deceptive: what you take to be a
deep stainturns out to be the stark
shadow of a fold. '

' One of the attractions of this show

is the written statement 7 prepared
by each artist. Each explains what
he was trying to do and what he
was working with. The feeling‘ of
‘the experiment is still there, caught
in the exhibition.

This particular show will end on
February 16th. A show of the
faculty’s work will _follow. And
sometime around April 14, a
collection of’ undergraduate work
should be ready for viewing.

A stop into the Gallery is like a
stop into any store on Forbes. On

your way down the street, you can ‘

make a detour, take a turn around
the room, and be out the door in
twenty steps if nothing pleases
you.

BY G.W. STEVENS
Sports Editor
—The Pitt basketball team is truly
in the stretch run and in the next
week will close out their home
schedule with three contests. All
three of these games, West Vir-
ginia, Virginia, and Niagara, will
-be important contests for the Cats
and tonight’s game in particular is
crucial.

The Cats are currently 11-8 com-

ing off last week’s near upset of the _‘

South Carolina Gamecocks in Co-
lumbus, SC. They are now in ﬁfth
place in the ECAC Southern Divi-
sion but the race is tight and just
two games separate the ﬁve teams.
Just above the Panthers are the
West Virginia Mountaineers with a

- record of 12 wins against seven

defeats.

So tonight’s game is very impor-
tant to the upcoming invitations to
the post-season tourney. The Cats
are 1-2 against conference foes
witha win over St.,Francis and
losses to Duquesne and WVU. A
win tonight would even the Cats
divisional record and tie them with
the Mounties in overall record, to
two of the factors which will
determine the invitations.

But despite the Panthers streak of
22 straight wins in Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse and six wins in the last
seven games the Cats are in danger
of ﬁnally losing one at home.

The West Virginia team is going

to be tough, one of the toughest-

tests of the year for the Cats. They
have already defeated the Panthers
once, back in December in the
WVU Coliseum. The Cats squand-
ered a ten point lead in that game
and then blew a four point lead in
the overtime period to come away
with an 82-78 defeat.

Since their first meeting, the
second game of the season for both
squads, the Mounties have been up
and down and haven’t been able to
beat any teams of high-calibre.

PageA1—2-THE PITT NEWS—Wednesday, February 12, 1975

Cars Meet Mounties in Crucial '|'esI'*

However, their best showing of the
year came just last Saturday after-
noon when they overcame a 21
point deﬁcit to defeat the Orange-
men of Syracuse 84-81 in the
Syracuse ’Zoo,’ a feat which few
teams have accomplished.

The Mounties have not been too
successful on the road this season
with a 3-4 away record. They have
lost to Purdue, American, Utah,
Virginia, and have managed road
victories over Penn State, Du-
quesne, and the Orange. Never-
theless, they are well acquainted
with the Pitt Fieldhouse which
should neutralize the Cats advan-
tage.

The man to watch tonight is
Warren Baker. He was the
difference in their earlier game
with Pitt scoring 31 points, most of
them in the second half, while
grabbing 22 rebounds. On .the

year, Baker is averaging around 17 ,

points and 11 rebounds.

But Baker may find the going a
little rough tonight as a little older
and a litter wiser Melvin Bennett
attempts to keep Baker from re-
peating his ﬁne performance.
Bennett was able to do a commen-
dable job against Baker in their
first meeting pulling down 17
rebounds of his own. With nearly
a year’s.experience under his belt
against the nation’s toughest com-
petition, Bennett is well prepared
for the return of ‘.‘Wonderful”
Warren.

Junior college transfer Stan Bosk-
ovich could also be a factor in
tonight’s game with his 18 point
average. Boskovich has had some
outstanding showings this season

such as his 40 point performance

against Davidson and 31 point
output against Massachusetts.

The leading scorer for the Pan-
thers is still Kirk Bruce with a 17
point average. Keith Starr and
Tom Richards are still averaging
double ﬁgures with 13 and 12
points respectively. .

Freshman forward Larry Harris
was injured Wednesday night a-
gainst the Gamecocks when he
suffered a bruised knee in the ﬁrst
half. However, Harris has been
able to practice this’ week after
sitting out the Athletes In Action
exhibition game last Saturday and
should see action again tonight.

The Mountaineers are currently
3-1 in the ECAC Southern Division.

They have defeated Villanova,
Duquesne, and Pitt but were upset
on their own floor by George
Washington. The Mounties are a
good bet to make it to the division
torney which will be held in their
Coliseum the second weekend in
March. As for the Cats, we’ll know
tonight.

Jerry DeMuro, a 19 year old

Philadelphian, is the Panthers’
best shot at qualifying as a swim-

mer for the NCAA championships. -

He is the tankers’ long distance

Toten: A Faceless Name  

BY RICK STOUFFER
Associate Sports Editor

Ed Totin is a forgotten man.
Totin belongs to the group of men
called relay runners. They are the
people who run for the team effort,
not personal glory and to be sure

they don’t get any respect. Just a
name—not a face.
The trouble is Totin is an out-
standing athlete and would be
getting heaps of publicity if not a
relayer.

“Ed is one very hard worker,”
according to track coach Jim Ban-

The “faceless” name Ttin n in his familiar role as an anchor -

man on any given relay team. Totin has been praised by Coach Jim
Banner as a very coachable runner who never complains and who

always “does the job.”

I

ner. “He isn’t the type of athelete

who is born with a lot of ability but I

he puts out hard work and gets the
-ipb done.”

Totin has been an outstanding
track man not only since coming to

Pitt three years ago but in high-

school at, or on if you like, Mars.

“We didn’t have the greatest
facilities in the world but excellent
coaches made up for it,” said the
tall [6’1”] brown-haired speedster.

“In sophomore and junior year we
won 22 meets straight, took the
WPIAL, and were second in the
state.”

Coming to Pitt proved to be an
exasperating experience to Totin
for his first year.

“When I came here from high
school I thought I was the greatest
thing in track. I couldn’t be
beaten. I soon found out things
weren’t the same and I took it
really hard. In fact it turned me
sour for two years of running.”

Now a junior Totin has loosened
up concerning traveling to meets.
He is known as a “great” joke
teller with his “Totin time,” a
highlight of any trip although some
tracksters have asked him to buy a
joke book or contract laryngitis.

He is just getting back into
running well also. “Ed has come a
long way,” said Banner. "‘His
times haven’t been too good and
that is why he has run relays up to
now. But he runs wherever he is
needed and doen’t complain. He
takes everything in stride.”

(Continued on Page 15)

them. Not that I was particularly
interested in swimming. At nine
years old I just didn’t have much
else to to.” A

To make a long story short, his
mother surprised him one day by
signing him up for the club
swimming team. “I couldn’t be-
lieve it,” he said, astonished. “I
would doggy paddle as far as I
could, then practically drown trying
to get air. The whole team used to
get a real kick out of watching me

—try to swim.”

Well, because practice makes

perfect, Jerry left those summer.

months behind him and when he
returned for the next season, he got

pretty good. “I sort of lost interest
in swimming after that,” he says,-

“The next time I really got.inter-
ested in swimming again was in my
junior or senior year of high
school.’ ’ This lack of interest ‘didn’t
reallv hold him back, as he was a
four year letterman at St. Joe’s
Prep in Philly.

“When I was looking at colleges, I
came here to check out their
facilities, and I was really im-
pressed.” He was’ similarly im-
pressed with long distance swim
coach Fred Lewis. “He’s really
helped me along, and was probably
the reason I chose Pitt. And now
that I’m here, I don’t regret it.”

Jerry gets up at 6:15 every
morning, and he and Lewis drive
up to Trees -Pool for a morning
workout before returning for class-
es. “It’s kind of a drag, getting up
that early, because the cafeteria
isn’t even open yet, and I end up
eating cookies or something before
I go up in the morning.”

.Ierry’s dedication to the sport

Yes fans, you too can attend
tonight’s basketball game between
West Virginia and Pitt. There are
approximately‘ 500 student ex-
change tickets remaining for the

game and they can be picked up -

today between 10-6 in the Student
Union ticket office.
Students are also reminded that

exchange tickets for Saturday's

game with the University of Vir-

‘ginia will be available beginning
tomorrow at 3 pm in the ticket ~

office.

leaves one aghast. He swims
between 6-10 miles every day, as
well as doing 200 sit-ups before
each practice. Perhaps this is why
he was a freshman starter and
letterman for Dick Bradshaw in his
first year here. . -

He is very pleased with the team
morale here. “We’re really tight”
he says. “We do a lot of things

. together, and after the meets on

Saturday we go up to Eric Shultz’s
room and have our party. Most of
the guys are pretty civil, and don’t
get carried away, except for Dave
Natali. He had me chug abouteight
cans of beer one night and I didn’t
know where I was.

“Our training table isn’t like the
football players, and if your meal is
out to get you, well, you’ve had it.”

The team‘ morale is evident in ‘ya

everything they do. “We all went/
down to see The Life and Times of
Xaviera Hollander, and. you know,
it wasn’t too bad. It even had a

“plot.”

Why go through all the effort to be
a long distance swimmer? “I
wonder that myself,” Jerry con-
fessed. “Schep (John Schepner)
says distance swimmers are
‘ sprinters with no brains.”’ And
his motivation? “Well, an event
like the 200 free doesn’t take much
talent,” he says, smiling at the
thought of what Schepner will say‘
to that. “If you miss a turn, you lost
a race. The 1000 takes more strat-
egy. .

“Pm a little disappointed with
this season, since we could have
pretty easily been undefeated.” He
was asked if he had any personal
goals. “Well, I’m a Poll Sci major
right now, but I don’t know about
that. All I really want to do is
qualify for the NCAA’s and then
place at the big meet. I could even
be an All-American if I do that.”
And as for the Olympics? “I’d like
to qualify for the trials, just so I
could go out to California again.”

He is more than modest about all

the honors they could soon be 7-

coming his way. He is truly a nice
guy, who didn’t really take much of
an interest in swimming, and may
soon be reaching the heights of his
career. He is in the top 15
nationally, and for that we can say’
“Thank you Mrs. DeMuro.” ‘

BY ANDY BEHREND

It is two winters ago. The scene
takes place in a cramped high
school gymnasium, so tightly
quartered that a player is threat-
ened with bodily harm if the brakes
aren’t put on immediately after a

'4)‘-,&.1iving lay-up. If not a wall

crunchingly embraces the shooter.

The crowd is boisterous, excited
by the prospect of upsetting their
highly favored opponent. They
"scream at the other team, and
direct most of the verbal abuse at
their star player.

On this day he’s been called many
things, the gentlest of which is ‘hot
dog!’ His bronze, coppery face
smiles when he hears the names.

Inevitably his team pulls away,

2 and the star attempts to clinch the

win with two foul shots.
The crowd boils and tosses some
rather nasty words toward the

fang, shooter. He swishes the first shot,

 -i

?‘glances at the unfriendly faces in

the stands, and winks.

The second shot _emulates the
ﬁrst, and now the star, secure in
victory, ‘looks at the mass "and
breaks out in a huge, beaming grin.

The mystique of Melvin Bennett
has been displayed.

And- it has c'".1tin'ued at Pitt,
where the freshman phenomena
has been more intimidating on
defense than most big men in Pitt’s
recent history.

He’s averaged only nine points
‘per game, but the Panthers’
offense does not depend upon
Bennett’s scoring prowess. They
look mainly for him toistop the
oppo_sition’s big man, a task almost
too cruel to ask of a 19 year old kid.

But he’s succeeded more often
than not, especially as of late. A
not-so-fond memory for Bennett

returns tonight at the Field House,:

when he’ll see a guy who’s been
semi-haunting him for weeks:

ﬁWarren Baker of West Virginia.

When last the two met, in
Morgantown on December 3, Baker
pretty much had "his own way,
scoring and rebounding at will. It
was a new albeit disturbing feeling
for Bennett.

“The biggest change from playing
in the City League to here is, just
that everyone here (college ball) is
equal. They’re just as tall and just
as strong as I am.”

Hetalks unabashedly about the
job Baker did on him.

“He was really tough for me to
handle, played really good. I think
he had something like 31 points
and 22 rebounds.”

 

  

He could have pointed out that the
ﬁrst WVU game was his second in
a Panther uniform (do you’ count
Ohio Northern?), but he is a—kid
who’s mature enough not to make
alibis, even if the situation calls for
it.

It appears, to one guy at least,
that nothing turns on Bennett more
than drawing a charge or jamming
some poor, unsuspecting dude.
When this occurs (usually about
twice a game for the blocks, he has
45 on the“year) the ever-present
smile creeps over his face and
mesmerizes his fans.

turn Pitt’s way. When this
happens, I’m out there having
fun.” K

An earlier concern of Bennett’s
was his position--center. College
teams win with a 6'7” center with
regularity about as often as
William Jennings Bryan won the
presidency (he was 0-3, sports
fans). Bennett himself thought he
might have been more effective at
forward. He's dismissed all those
thoughts now, turning his attention
to the team’s needs.

“Wherever the coach puts me,

Imagine an order of
22,000 priests and brothers in
73 countries around the world.
(That's a pretty big family.)

But that's what the
Salesians of St. John Bosco
are all about — a large family
of community-minded men
dedicated to the service of ‘
youth. (And no one gets lost.)

that's where I'll play. And as long - 
he says, “I'm A

as I’m playing,”

Perhapsa forward position will be A
in store for Bennett should Pitt land ,

a big man for next year. Bigger

than Bennett, that is, like about 6’l . _;='._r‘
If that happened, the Peabody _  _,

graduate says, “Pd have to“wo‘rk
all summer at forward, and practice
on my offense.” I

But for now, he’s‘ a center.
Warren Baker should ﬁnd that out
tonight. And_the fans will realize it

tonight, as another chapter in the * A » 

mystique of Mel Bennett will be
revealed.

 
   

In Italy in the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets —’ and

back to‘God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with-
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)

atmosphere of family.

The ideals of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools,
guidance centers, summer camps and missions. And his very
human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is.
The Salesianiexperience isn't learned — it’s lived.

Dear Editor, .

Jim Spanos really shows an
overwhelming lack of knowledge in
his article of 2/5/75 on the Top
Twenty. I am a Pitt student and a
good Pitt basketball fan but there
isn’t any way they deserve to be

He picks on LaSalle, Notre Dame,
Marquette, Clemson and Oregon
State. The only team I can agree
with is Marquette. They aren’t

L anywhere near as -good as past
_ Warrior teams.

First, LaSalle is deserving of its
position because of victories over

Alabama, ‘Memphis State, Clem-
son, and Dayton, all on the road.
Pitt has been defeated or severely
tested by such powerhouses as
Penn State, Bucknell and Temple
on the road. Penn State is below
.500, Bucknell plays a host of
nobodies, and Temple (4-14) is the
worst team to hit Philly since the
Phillies of years back. All the teams
beaten by LaSalle, using his
reasoning, would beat the heck out
of Pitt. (By the way, Western
Kentucky is not a bad team. They
have already beaten Purdue, over
.500 in the Big Tenn, and LaSalle
on the road.)

Tate-n:i Unsung Hero

Speaking of stride, one of the
‘main reasons Toten’s times are not

Yes fans, you too can attend
tonight’s basketball game between
West Virginia and Pitt. There are
approximately 500 student_ ex-
change tickets remaining, for the
game and they can be picked up

_today between 10-6 in the Student

Students are also reminded that
exchange tickets for Saturday’s

ginia will be available beginning

indoor tracks tend to hamper a tall
runner forcing “the tall one” to
never go all out as he would like.
“I feel totally cramped indoors.
The turns and banked surfaces are
murder on my legs. Outdoors I feel
I can definitely compete in indivi-_
dual events with confidence.”
As far as a long range goal, tall Ed
looks forward to the 1976 Olympics.
“I’ve wanted to run in the
Olympics since I was ﬁve years old.
Of course up to now I haven’t had a
time which would be considered
Olympic material, but like I0 said
it’s a dream.” 1
That’s the way with these faceless
names. Sometimes they will jump
right up and surprise everyone.

Any team that beats UCLA
anytime deserves a top 20 ranking.
They (Notre Dame) have, without a
doubt, the toughest schedule in
college basketball. They don’t have
any Rollins, Ohio Northerns, or
Buffaloes on their schedule. Why
does Jim mention all the teams
they have lost to? Does he seriously
think Pitt could beat any of them?
Maybe Pitt is as good as Notre
Dame, but until they stop
scheduling joke games, they’ll
never see the Top 20.

Clemson and Oregon State fit into
the same category. There are no
less than four teams from 'each
conference in the Top 20. N.C.
State, North Carolina, Maryland
and Clemson are all in there as well
as UCLA, USC, Oregon and
Oregon State. If Pitt played any of
these teams once, they would be
lucky to beat them once. I

Also, what makes Jim think that
Lafayette and Holy Cross are so
bad? They both have records of
14-3 and play very respectable
small school schedules. Lafayette
beat Rutgers, who Pitt struggled

‘against, and Holy Cross took Notre

Dame to the wire recently.

Pitt just got done choking away
their only -chance of pulling off a
major. upset this year on the road
and that is what makes a good
college team. Jim also mentions
Duquesne in a bad light. They did
beat Pitt, how bad can they be?

A Case Of Non-Support

BY G. W. STEVENS
Sports Editor

It is difficult to ascertain just what effect fan support has on a college
team, but it is generally accepted that a boisterous crowd can inspire
even a mediocre team to excellence. This is just about what is
happening at the University of South Carolina this season.

‘ The Gamecocks have, over the past few years, established a winning

I - attitude that reaches to every corner of Columbia, South Carolina (and

perhaps even the entire state). Since the completion of the SC
Coliseum back in 1968, the USC basketball team has compiled an
almost unbelievable home record of 77-5 and have lost just two home
contests over the past four years. ‘

A large part of this success can be attributed to the dedicated
Gamecock fans who have crowded into the massive Coliseum so far this

' season to the tune of 11,200 raving lunatics per game. These fans not

only support a great basketball program with the big bucks that roll in
from each home game, drawing top notch recruits who desire the
exposure they will undoubtedly receive, but they also add something
special to the game just by enjoying themselves.

The Gamecock fans get behind their team from the outset, cheerina.
clapping, stomping, and joining in musical encouragement, lead by the
expertise of the USC p'ep band. And although their rowdyism at times

. intimidates their opponents (and occasionally the referees also), their

behavior isn’t of the belligerent type exhibited at such places as N.C.
State, Notre Dame, Syracuse, and the Steel Bowl (that is, when
Duquesne is playing).

This may come as a bit of a shock to all you Pitt fans, but there
actually are fans like this. Unfortunately, few (if any) of these
clamorous type of supporters attend Pitt athletic events.

To begin with, Pitt supporters do not even attend athletic events
unless the team is winning. (That is for football and basketball; they
don't attend minor sporting events whether the team is winning or
not). When they do ﬁnally show up, they cheer sporadically and only
when something extremely exciting or funny occurs. On the whole,
they can be best classiﬁed as dull, inhibited, and disinterested.

There are probably many factors contributing to this dismal display.
A large crowd is totally useless unless they have a capable leader to
V organize them, and such an individual is deﬁnitely lacking here at Pitt.

i

s

Pitt’s pseudo-cheerleading squad is simply ignored by the fans during
football season, as is the childish antics of the Panther, and only serve
as a back-up to Pitt’s only true “cheerleader,” Tiger Paul, during
basketball season.

The fans can’t really be faulted for ignoring the Pitt cheerleaders,
however. They lack the ability to attract the fans attention simply
because their repetoire of cheers is limited to “Let’s Go Pitt,” which
usually dies out soon after it starts. The only thing the cheerleaders do
with any proficiency is shuffle to the discordant sounds of that group of
yellow-jacketed, off-key musicians who profess to be a pep band (and
do their best to de-psych the fans by playing at all the wrong times).

I must be fair, however, and congratulate the fans for responding in
certain key situation, such as the Rutgers and Notre Dame comeback
victories. But, when the Cats were in the process of falling behind in
the first half of both games, where were the fans? On most occasions
the noise level at basketball games is,such that if you listen closely you
can hear the foundation of “Old Fitzgerald” settle into the hill.

The Pitt basketball team has reached the most crucial portion of their
schedule. The upcoming games against West Virginia, Virginia and
Niagara could easily decide their chances of a berth in the post-season

_division tourney which in turn could lead to their second consecutive

NCAA tournament.

Tonight’s game against WVU is especially important and the Cats just
simply have to win it. But the Mounties are going to be tough. Anyone
that saw their performance in Syracuse on Saturday can attest to that.
The Panthers need the support of the fans (especially the students]
now more than ever. '

But basketball isn’t the only sport that needs fan support. The
indoor track team is one of the most exciting ‘in the history of the
University, yet no one attends their meets. The Pitt wrestling team,
which boasts two All-Americans, has improved substantially with a 6-3
mark and is totally destroying all but the “super” squads on their
schedule, yet no one attends their meets. The same is true for the
men’s swimming team as well as women’s events.

I realize that there are numerous things of interest in Pittsburgh and
the Pitt athletic complex is located in a not easily accessable place. But
the performance of the Pitt athletic teams is worth the walk up Cardiac
Hill. All the athletic schedules are currently in the stretch run and now
is the time to support the Cats.
