as he recalls the days of old W. U.

three undergraduate ‘fraternities, none '
of them Nationals, and all of them»
having their activities conﬁned to one
or ‘two small rooms. The three,fra-

had a brief. career on the old campus,
although it did not come into prom-
inence until the _University took up
its abode on the Schen1ey—farmsA..".. A

Fraternity life at W’. ‘U. P- with
these conditions, was hardly what it

spirit, nevertheless‘. .4 The frat-ts usu-
ally rented a roornﬂor two with a
private family and ate their lunches‘
there-1——when there was any one to
