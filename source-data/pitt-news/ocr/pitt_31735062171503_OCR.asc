Students to Sit on Trustee Committees

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Students will soon be attend-
ing Board of Trustees commit-
tee meetings on a regular bas-
is, although student member-
ship on the Board itself still
appears remote.

Lenny Klavonic. Student Gov-
ernment president. announced
Monday that he is seeking junior
and senior applicants for spots on
the five committees of the Board:
Student Affairs. Academic Af-
fairs, Financial Development, Fa-
cilities, and Health Center.

VOTING “ACADEMIC”

According to William Rea. chair-
man of the Board. the students
will be “observers. not voting
members. but will be free to
speak at meetings.“ Rea termed
the question of voting "academic“
because Trustees committes
general reach decisions by con-
sensus.

Student participation in Trus-
tee Committee discussions will
not be entirely new. Since the ad-
ministration of Ken Schueler,
1968 SG head, students have

occasionally contributed ideas at
Trustee committee sessions.

Over a year ago the Trustees
agreed to designate three students
«two undergraduates and one
graduate student) as observers.“

WILLIAM RE-A
Chairrnan of the Board of Trustees

“OBSERVERS” MIFFED
Klavonic. one of the current un-
dergraduate observers. told the
Pitt News that he and Linda Os-

wald. the other undergraduate ob-
server. stopped attending Trus-
tee meetings after becoming frus-
trated at the first meeting.

Linda and I felt the futility of
sitting there and listening to Trus-
tees discussing student affairs,”
Klavonic recalled. “It’s meaning-
less if you can’t have any inter-
action.”

After talking with Jack Free-
man. executive assistant chancel-
lor. and Dan MacFadden. execu-
tive assistant to the vice-chancel-
lor for Student Affairs. Klavonic
approached Rea. who advised him
to go ahead and appoint students
to the committees.

“Rea appeared happy to have
students sitting on the commit-
tees." Klavonic observed.

REA NONCOMMITTAL

Asked whether he would be re-
ceptive to the idea of allowing stu-
dents to serve as voting members
of the Board. Rea said he would
reserve judgment until the re-
lease of recommendations by Dr.
Holbert Carroll of the Political
Science Department. Carrol is di-
rector of the Governance Studv.

expected to be completed by early
next year.

Freeman, speaking for the ad-
ministration, also refused to com-
mit himself, but expressed res-
ervations which Rea did not. “I’m
just not sure whether the Univer-
sity ought to move to a formal sys-
tem of electing students to the
Board,” Freeman said.

"But my personal feeling." he
added. "is that there is a conflict
of interest when students serve on
the Board. because they are so in-
timately involved with matters
that are discussed."

KOPEREK OPTIMISTIC

Bernard Koperek, director of
Alumni Affairs. spoke in a much
more positive vein. "1 don't _think
many people have an objection to
students being on the Board.“ he
argued. “But some are afraid that
students might use the Board for
political action. "

Koperek agreed that. in the
light of recent student behavior at
Pitt. such a fear seems unfound-
ed. “If we would have students on
the Board conducting themselves

as I've seen them eonductithem
selves. it would be completéty ac
ceptable." he said. 

Going out on a limb,

‘ flatly predicted that “the

be student representation 0:53 the
Board.” 

If students present the Trustees
with a carefully considered plan
for student representation. Kop-
erek opined. it will be accepted.

Two-Pronged Panel

Debates Abortion Issue

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Dr. Cyril Wecht. alternately fielding critical and complimentary
outbursts. told a predominantly student audience that the state abortion
laws would "probably be reviewed by January of 1971.“

The coroner of Allegheny County spoke .\Ionday night in David
Lawrence Hall on the pro side of a bipartisan panel dealing with the
question: Should Abortion Be Legalized?

The two and one-half hour debate marked the opening of Environ-
mental Action/Zero Population Growth’s Abortion and Birth Control
Information Week. slated to continue through Thursday night.

Rejecting the solution of abortion on demand. Wecht insisted that
the issue "must remain essentially a medical question.“ The politician-
physician criticized New York's abortion regulations. the most liberal
in the country. which permit therapeutic abortions until the 24th week
of pregnancy. Instead. he proposed a 16 week cut off point.

"We must look to court decisions." he said. “Laws much more lib-
eral than those of Pennsylvania have been deemed unconstitution in
other states."

Abortion as a “population control or birth control measure” was
opposed by pro speaker Dr. Marilynn Goldsmith, associate professor of
Biology and activist in ZPG here. She attacked state abortion statues
on their “unconstitutionality.”

Abortion is the only medical procedure on legislation.” she claim-
ed. "It is an issue that has been compromised by the legislators. most
of whom are men." Dr. Goldsmith referred to the abortion laws as “a
way of keeping 51 per cent of the population in compulsory slavery.

Psychiatrist Maurice Cerul. M.D.. currently working out of West-
ern Psychiatric Institute. produced documented studies revealing that
ill the vast majority of post-abortion women feel no guilt or regret
about their decisions and (2) women denied abortions. when match-
ed with those who received them upon request. raised children with a
significantly higher incidence of emotional and social problems.

“The question of the birthright of a child is no longer an individual
decision, but a world problem,” he suggested.

On the opposing side. city attorney John De.\Iay labelled abortion
“premediated murder“ and rapped “the matters of convenience that
have served as justifications for abortion."

"Liberalized abortion is a request. not a necessity." he heatedly
told a hostile gathering. "Its only a desire and your desire is not enough
to cut short a human life.“

Physician Earl Bell Smith viewed abortion on demand as “a pre-
amble to euthenasia, sexual promiscuity and man’s inhumanity to
_man.” His co-panelist M.D. James Datillo, obstetrician and gynecolo-

MDC Answers Chargesis

by ELLEN GANLEY

Arnold Steinberg. president of the Men‘s Dorm
Council (MDC). answered allegations recently
brought against him and the MDC on Monday night
in The Pitt News office.

Steinberg stated that the charges. brought
against the Council by student Joseph Forbes. had
no basis whatsoever.

Concerning the trip the MDC members took to
Ontario last year. Steinberg asserted that "it was
a goal of mine to eliminate such projects. I was
against it in the first place and it certainly won't
happen again. Partof my campaign for election as
MDC president was to eliminate such wastes of
money.

The rental of refrigerators was another issue
with which Forbes confronted the MDC. Forbes
stated that the Council was making a $12 profit for
the rental of each refrigerator. Steinberg and MDC
Treasurer Dennis Concilla asserted that the Coun-
cil had actually only realized a $3 profit, which they
split with the Women's Housing Board.

The next point that Steinberg rebuked was the
claim that the MDC and WHB were taking all the
credit for the 24-hour open house. which Forbes
asserted was solely the result of a student referen-
dum.

Steinberg stated. "If we hadn‘t voted on the ref-

erendum in the first place. it would never have
reached the students." ' I

The final charge that Steinberg answered was
that the MDC didn’t perform any real function and
didn’t help the student in any way.

Concerning this charge. Steinberg pointed out
that the MDC sponsored the original open houses in
the dorms and has brought many speakers, films,
and forums to the students. He added that the MDC

SG Initiates Search   
For Orientation Head it

by ELLIOT GILL

Student Government is looking f'or a chairman I 

for the 1971 orientation committee. “The New
Student Workshop.“ A special committee consisting

of four Student Government Senators and the former ”  

chairman of the orientation program has been chos-

en by Student Government President Lenny Kla-  if

vonic to select a new chairman.

The responsibilities of the chairman are broad. 

First of all. he must select a committee to assist
him in his duties. Then. he and the committee will

develop a program designed to introduce new stu-, >

dents to the University.

While developing the program. the chairman and
his committee will be required to attend several
meetings each week with administrative and stu-
dent affairs personnel. After formulating the pro-

gram. the committee. under the leadership of the I

chairman, will supervise it next summer.

It’s a time-consuming job and one which involves
a great deal of commitment on the part of the chair-
man, according to outgoing committee chairman,
Carl Van Horn. “lt’s not a job without its rewards,

however,” he added. “It gives the chairman great , , S 

flexibility and an opportunity to create and innovate
a program which will help to orient freshmen to
University life. The chairman will also have a

chance to meet many people and to gain a great A’

knowledge of the University.

“Overall." commented Van Horn. “It‘s an ex-
tremely worthwhile educational experience, if one
is willing to make the commitment."

The special committee is now accepting applica-
tions and will begin its interviews on Fridays. Stu-
dents whoiare interested in the job may pick up ap-

plications in room 5%, Student Union. Applications 

must be inby Monday. T ..

The Universitys Provost
Search Committee has finally
completed its task after extended
deliberation. according to Jack
Freeman. executive assistant
chancellor.

The faculty—student committee
has been in operation since April.
when the present provost.- Dr.
Charles H. Peake. announced his
plans for retirement this January.
Since then. the members have
been collaborating on the identifi-
cation and evaluation of candi-
dates. explained Freeman. Cri-
teria for qualification were dis-
cussed at open hearings held in
May.

The office of provost entails di-
rect jurisdiction over all deans
except those of the health profes-
sions. Freeman described the pos-
ition as the “Chancellor’s academ-
ic deputy,” responsible for gener-

Freeman maintained that the
responsibility of the committee—-
to recommend a slate of nominees
to the Chancellor——has been ful-
filled. The Chancellor is now in
the process of further reviewing
the credentials of the presented
candidates. It will be his decision
as to which candidate will be ap-
proached first for the post.

Prison: Statement Read

 

Rally Supports Angela Davis

by DANA VENTRIGLIA

“The only way we are going to
free Angela Davis is to build a
massive movement in support of
her composed of people who have
a wide spectrumof political view-
points,” Mrs. Fania Jordan, Miss
Davis’ sister, told a gathering of
about 400 people at the First Uni-
tarian Church in Shadyside.

At the “Emergency Fall Cam-
paign for Equal Justice“ rally on
Monday night, Mrs. Jordan spoke
in support of her sister and all
“political prisoners.” especially
blacks in what was termed “a vio-
lently racist society."

Before reading a statement re-
leased by Miss Davis from a New
York prison, Mrs. Jordan noted
that groups in support of Angela.
which presently number approxi-
mately 150, are spontaneously
growing on a nationwide basis.

In the statement which was pre-
viously released to the UPI, Miss
Davis condemned both the “re-
actionary forces of this country”
for having chosen “to prosecute
me as a black Communist,” and
the mass media for wasting space
to inform the country of her past

life instead of making them cog-

nizant of the plight of political
prisoners.

“Turning myself in,” the state-
ment continued, “would have been
voluntarily placing my head on the
prosecutioners block.” She main-
tained that it was of primary im-

portance that the revolution “con-
tinue to gain in vigor and force."

Florance Kennedy. a well-
known black lawyer, continued in
the same vein. advocating justice
for Angela Davis and other poli-
tical prisoners. E , I

During the course of her fiery
speech, Mrs. Kennedy contended
that “it is imperative that we
maintain a loud voice around this
case. . . . They want to kill this
woman.

“Who is innocent?" she quer-
ried. “Who bought the guns in
this country that killed Martin
Luther King . . . John Kennedy . . .
the Kent State ‘students ?"

Answering her own questions.
Mrs. Kennedy asserted that all

dents to have liquor andheating
elements in their rooms.

Presently. Steinberg stated. the
MDC is involved in sponsoring the
January Concert of the Month and
is trying to obtain a TV lounge and
game room for the Tower C lobby.

Steinberg concluded that the
MDC is in charge of the overall
policy of the Towers. They are
hoping to extend their power to
the control of all quad policy. L

Amidst shouts of “Right On,”
Mrs. Kennedy declared that “Nix-
on and Agnew cross over all the
state lines to incite violence and
riots and nobody does anything!”

Before leaving the stage. the
middle-aged lawyer seriously
pleaded for support in “freeing all
political prisoners." Continuingin

that “this time its freedom for

How Some of Us Became Americans

by DON MARBURY, Editor

(Editor's Note: Everyone knows that the Black man, during the slave era, had to
undergo a horrible ordeal in just trying to survive. Todays modern Black mouths words like,
“Yeh man, we've undergone almost 200 years of opression.” So called white liberals are
always saying that they can sympathize with the Black man and understand the causes
behind his anger. But although many persons, white and black alike, know that slavery was
bad—do they know why it was bad? Do they know the actual things that the slave had to
live with day after day? Just what were some of the things that caused the Black man to
have to bear such an almost irwithstandable life? Here are some documented facts.)

When white men found how easily they could exploit the Black man they imported
slaves in numbers that leapt by the thousands each year, until the Black drain from Africa
ran into the millions.

The slave traders (those who had consciences) tried to rationalize with themselves
that they were delivering the black man, from constant tribal wars. and a primative
unhappy life.

But before the white man moved in, Africa was a territory of peace and happy
civilizations, with a highly developed culture and history. If a hand full of men were killed
in any sort of dispute, the slave traders would propagandize the event, so out of
proportionately, that it would appear to have been a great tribal battle.

The slave traders broke up tribal life. They destroyed the crops of the black man, so
that in many cases he had to resort to cannibalism, or die himself. The captive woman
would sell their bodies in return for food, thus degrading the status of the African wife.
Tribeshad to supply slaves or be sold as slaves themselves, so naturally they, not wanting
to sell members of their own tribes into slavery, waged war on neighboring tribes in order
to sell captives to their white aggressors. The white man caused violence and degradation
to reign in Africa.

There are three parts to the slaves ordeal even before he reached the slave
plantation. Let’s imagine that you are a slave just sold to the white man.

1) You and your fellow tribesmen are fastened one to the other in columns, and
loaded with heavy bricks of about 40 or 50 pounds to prevent escape attempts. Your friend
beside you isvweakly and can’t carry his brick, and is immediately killed. You now start
your long march to the waiting slave ships, which are probably almost a hundred miles
away. The very young, the weakly, sick, and very old are dropped along the way to die in
the ‘African jungles.

2) At the slave ports, you are thrown into pens like cattle, so that you can be
inspected by the buyers. Thousands of your people are packed into these pens which are
only large enough to accommodate a few hundred. The mortality is more than 20 per cent
of your people packed into these pens. All about you is death.

3) You are packed into the hold of a ship one above the other and given an allotted I

space of about three by four by three, so you can neither lie down at full length or sit
uprightly. So that you won’t revolt, your right hand is chained to your right leg and the
same with your left hand and leg. You are then attached by the chain in rows to long iron
bars. You find that you aren’t allowed up from this hell for as many as three weeks at a
time. The closeness of so many people, their bruised and festering flesh, and the stifling
air in the hole cause many deaths, and you realize that you might not survive the trip
yourself.

You find that your captain is a cruel, heartless unmerciful man. To him you are just

Does It Mean, And How
Can Black People Find It?

merchandise. You pray that the wind is strong, and does not calm down, for you know tha
it is a standard practice for captains held up by calm winds, or unable to meet thei
deadline at the slave auction to poison the whole cargo. You think about yesterday (or wa
it last week), when all of you pleaded with the captain for a little food. The captain had s
great a fear of rebellion or insurrection that he killed the man next to you, divided hi
heart, liver and entrails into 300 pieces, and made all of you eat one piece. Sometimes yo
were allowed to come up on deck for a little exercise which meant that you were to danc
for the crew. During these times a lot of your friends would jumb overboard to the waitin
sharks below; happy that their long agony is over.

N 4) Well you’ve made it to America, and you think that maybe your agony is over to
a while. Now the purchasers take over at the auction. They examine all of you for defects
They look at your teeth, pinch your skin, they just about examine everything you used t
examine when you looked at cows back home. You see your sister subjected to a ver
intimate observation. Everthing the purchaser wants to look at on her, he looks at. All 0
you are then branded on the side of your breasts. and your duties are explained to you b
an interpreter.

, 5) On the planation you soon find that you are being worked like an animal; as many
as 20 hours a day in the hot fields. Your “home” is a windowless hut, barely large enough
for two people, much less the 15 that stay in yours.

You are given maybe six pints of insect loaded f lour. rice, or beans, and half a dozen
herring, weekly. For the slightest reason. or just a whim of your overseer. you find tha
you receive very harsh punishments. It's not uncommon for you to see one of your people
whipped to death.

Whippings are usually administered to you with a cane, a woven cord or a thick
thong of cowhide, but when the overseer gets mad, if he doesn't have a whip with him, you
know it’s going to be given with his bare fists. And you better stand there and take it, and
afterwards maybe smile at him and say, “thank you.”

One day you get so hungry that you feel you are going to topple over. Only you dare
not, for you know thatwould mean a sure whipping. So as an alternative you eat some of
the crop. You get caught. For a month you have to wear a tin mask while out in the fields.

You think about all the tortures you and your people endure like: passing a piece of
hot wood over your behind; pouring salt, Cinders, and hot ashes on bleeding wounds;
cutting off limbs, ears, and private parts, etc.

But these aren’t the tortures that scare you. These tortures you stand. But what
about what they did to one of your friends who tried to escape? Roasting him alive. You
remember how they filled one “belligerant” of your pegple’s buttocks with gunpowder and
then set a match to him. 

You remember the look on your face as you watched one of your own relative
buried in the ground up to his neck, and his head smeared with jelly and sugar for th
insects. -

The Black man in the slave era truly was the first Victim of genocide. These are the
things that the history books are skirting over when they say little cute things like: The life
of the slave was hard. These are the things people are inferring, when they say: the slave
endured much pain and agony.

You know, it’s a funny thing but after going through enough to completely eradicate
a whole race of lesser men, the black man remained, and still remains——spirit unbroken.

Study Shows Most College
Students Favor Confrontation

 

by JACKIE CLAIBORNE

Brother Imamu Amira Baraka
(Leroi Jones), Black nationalist
spiritual leader and teacher for
the Committee for Unified New-
ark and Congress for an African
Peoples told us how to gain our
freedom last Thursday.

Brother Baraka described
Black Nationalism as the ability
for Black people to organize to
act against the forces which op-
press them. simply because of
their color. But he emphasized
that an organizational problem
among us is that we are addicted
to “one form or another of whit-
ism.”

“You can learn from anyone
or anything," but you don‘t have
to become that which you are
learning from,” he stressed.

HIS comment lends support to
the notion of why many Black
students on predominantly white
campuses do not get involved in
student activities. The fear that
we could never be fully accepted
and that we would have to assim-
ilate-—sacrifice some of our
Blackness in order to receive
any acceptance at all, is a justi-
fiable one.

But the issue for us right now
cannot be trying to fit in. It
should be obvious that Black
people in the U.S. have a defi-
nite struggle and as Baraka
said, “It cannot be confused with
the struggle of white liberals.

because we are a different peo-'

ple.’’

Young white society is fight-
ing for things like legalization of
marijuana and homosexuality.

’ l'ber ti n etc but

 

they have almost won their bat-
tles mainly because of their col-
or.

I WOULD like to plead to
Black sisters on campus to stand
behind your Black man for na-
tionalism and not in front of him
for women's liberation. There
can be no liberation for the
Black women unless the total
Black populous is liberated. For
as Brother Baraka emphasized.
“We should not confuse the goals
of our revolution.“ If something
is not about the business of na-
tionalist liberation for all Black
people it is not for us.

He said that our role as Black
people in the U.S. is to organize
our Black communities. and
transform our political aspects.
“Through politics you gain.
maintain and use power. and a
strong Black political party is
vehicle for that concept. "

He stated that we can gain
political power through self-de-
termination, self-respect, which
means the building of institutions
to legitimize Black culture. and
self-defense. meaning to make
war against thosewho make war
against us, and make peace with
those whom we can.

“THROUGH these concepts
we can built a Black political
party that moves from national-
ism to Pan-Africanism.“ Baraka
went on.

He told us that we cannot be-
come isolated‘ from our com-
munities. "If they are back-
wards. then so are you.“ As he

pointed out we cannot go out into

the streets preaching revolution
nd Bla kness unle w h

       

first gotten our most immediate
surroundings together.

“The revolutionary Black ac-
tivist must control everything in
their Black communities. but to
simply say that the War on Pov-
erty is jive and that we should
control it. is a contradiction."
the Black leader pointed out. He
admonished us to not just take it
for granted. but make them take
it completely out of the commun-
ity if necessary. This is what is
meant by Black community con-
trol.

HE CAUTIONED that “our
struggle is not to see how fast we
can be killed by the white peo-
ple. but one in which we can cre-
ate institutions to survive.“ It
seems Baraka is trying to tell
Black people that reaction. or
action without thought is sui-
cide.

The two most striking points
of his speech were those dealing
with the need for unity and the
Black process for preparation
for the coming revolution.

He stressed that we don‘t need
to be spouting a lot of rhetoric
as to what we are going to do and
how we are going to do it. We
just must be ready when the
time comes for action.

“IF THEY come after one.
make it so they have to come get
us all. and if we organize there
won't be no groups of Negroes
standing on the side. saying.
'Umh. umh. umh.‘ If you don't
organize your community some-
one else will.“ ‘

"Right on. Brother Baraka.

 

BERKELEY—-(CPS)~College students accept the use of con-
frontation tactics and reject the methods used by campus and civil
authorities to quell student protests. according to a survey released
by a research team at the Center for Research and Development in
Higher Education located at the University of California at Berekley.

A The survey of 1.452 college seniors was conducted on ten cam-
puses selected to represent different institutions by nature of size.
geographic location. state or private control. economic background
of the student body. Most of the students were white middleclass
men and women with above average academic records who grad-
uated last spring and summer.

When asked if they believed that some form of confrontation "is
necessary and effective" in changing the nations social and political
direction only one per cent concluded that confrontation was unnec-
essary. Nineteen per cent supported only some form of “peaceful
petitioning.“ Fifty-two per cent felt that “non-violent mass protest
is the only feasible way to persuade officials to respect the will of
the people." Nineteen per cent answered that the "use of disruptive
tactics and the destruction of property is often necessary to change
the status quo." And 19 per cent stated that “although some may get
badly hurt. actual physical confrontation and violence must at times
be resorted to in order to affect social change.“

The survey also reported that:

——Fifty per cent of the seniors indicated they were or “would have
been” participants in Vietnam war protests, and 36 per cent in-
dicated they would be in sympathy with such protests.

———Seventy-three per cent of the seniors agreed that “basically, the '

U.S. is a racist society” and 17 per cent disagreed.

-——-Fifty-six per cent of the seniors oppose suspension or dismissal
of students “who disrupt the normal functioning of the campus
by protest activities.” Twenty-one per cent favor suspension or
dismissal. i

————Despite the fact that none of the schools involvedin the study had

experienced the massive use of police force, 46 per cent of the

seniors see the police as instigators of violence and only 28
per cent disagreed.

The research team was unable to provide the names of the
schools involved in the study under the terms of their contracts with
participating institutions. a

Letters To The Editor

Concilla Safe’ in MDC Position

Editor. The Pitt News:

It is interesting to note that J0-
seph Forbes was never present at
the meeting that he describes so
vividly lPitt News, Nov. 16).
Therefore. I felt it necessary to
write this and clarify a few de-
tails for him.

First of all I am not serving in
MDC illegally. I would think that
Joe. as a member of MDC for two
consecutive years. would be fam-
iliar with the Constitution.

MDC membership is limited to
all “male dormitory residents of
the University" contrar_v to what
he might think I am a male dormi-
tory resident of this University.
MDC agreed at the first enterance
of a co—ed dorm experiment that
all male students involved would
be under the auspices of MDC.

Secondly. at the meeting in
question there were 11 voting
members present. MDC presently
consists of 21 members. 11 of
21 in my mathematical back-
ground is a quorum. Perhaps
Forbes is operating in a modular
four system. To clear up the vote
count: five voted for. four abstain-
ed. and two voted against.

Thirdly. Suzanne Slyman was
allowed as much time to speak as
anyone else present. In fact. it was
I who called for a motion to sus-

I ATTENTION

pend parliamentary procedure
specifically for that reason.

It was only after approximately
20 minutes of debate that some-
one called for a motion to limit de-
bate to five more minutes.

With regards to the $750 that
was allocated to MDC by alloca-
tions. I would like to remind all
concerned that this happened last
week. Since that time we have had
one MDC meeting. the meeting in
question. At that meeting plans
were made for a dance in the Tow-
ers to be held before Thanksgiv-
ing break.

As far as the surplus is concern-
ed. I received the comptroller
sheets last Monday; before that
time. we officially did not know
what was in our budget. In fact.
the one dance that MDC did sched-
ule early in the year has still not
been paid for because of the ques-
tionable state of the budget.

The money made on refrigera-
tor sales «which happens to be $3
per refrigerator and not $12 as
was reported) has not been re-
ceived as of yet.

A question that I would like to
ask to Forbes and anyone else
who has raised the point is “Why
doesn't the Student Government
Constitution concern us‘? Aren‘t
we members of this University?“

gist at Mercy Hospital, claimed
that “there is no medical reason
for therapeutic abortion.”

“This issue should be discussed
on a socio-economic. legal and

"but not on a medical basis. He

claimed that under the New York
procedures. three women of 10.-

tinued. "have a average fatality

errantly threw to Sanft which was
intercepted by Al Blasco in the
end zone. Blasco made a fantastic

_ one-handed catch of the pass.

The rest of the game was in
the complete control of the Play-
boy. Their rush of Pournaras
caused every pass to be hurried.
Pleasure Palace couldn‘t get any
offensive drives initiated.

Playboy has earned the right to
face Southerland House for the
dorm title.

Incidentally. earlier in the sea-
son Pleasure Palace defeated the
Playboys. 12-8.

It’s 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice.
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-
gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never
seen inside the Beetle.

in fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks its true identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE. -

Pitt Women Swimmers

Lose To Clarion Gals

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Clarion handed Pitts womens
varsity swim team a 70-34 loss
last Thursday.

Pitts problems were many.
'l‘lie meet. originally scheduled to
be a home meet. was at the last
minute changed, to the Clarion
pool. On the top of this confusion.
four of Pitts top—notch swimmers
were unable to participate at Clar-
ion due to illness.

The four swimmers were cap-
tain Diane Kase. Sally Brunson.
.\largie Wallace and Sally Phillips.

“The condition of the meet and
many of our top swimmers being
hit by illness certainly had to ef-
fect the performance of the team
and changed the outcome of the
meet,” said Pitt Coach Virginia
Grindle. “However,’ we fulfilled
our obligation even though sorely
hit.

"It was difficult for the girls
to pull in the points. but they did
what was expected of them."

Pitt took first and third place in
the 50 yard freestyle event. Kitty

teams performance even when

faced with adversity. "Anna Ma-

rie Crelli. Leslee Snyder. and

Penny Cox really pulled through.   N

for us at Clarion. The whole team
really pulled through. Winning is
nice. but whats more important
is to be a team. and the girls prov-

ed to me on Thursday that they

were just that. . . a team."
