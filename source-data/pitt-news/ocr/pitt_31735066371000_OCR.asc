Applications to Pitt on the rise

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News’

Despite the decrease in high school
graduates nationally, the University of
Pittsburgh is reporting a 3 to 4 percent
increase in applications for next fall and
is expecting to maintain its edge in the
increasingly intense competition be-
tween colleges for students.

According to the Oct. 30 issue of
the “Chronicle of Higher Education,”
nationwide enrollment figures have
topped 12 million in each of the last
five years, despite a 12 percent drop
in the number of graduates since 1980
and 1981.

Through direct mailing campaigns,
200 visits to high schools each year and
a ceiling on enrollment to keep class
sizes down, the university has kept its
recruiting program competitive with
other colleges, said Kevin Altomari,
from the Office of Admissions and Stu-

dent Aid at Pitt. -4 .

, . .

According to Joseph Merante, direc-
tor of the Admissions office, there has
been a 15 percent increase in the
number of out-of-state applicants to
Pitt. Most of these applications came
from New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland,
Washington, D.C. and Florida.
Altomari said New Jersey is the No.1
exporter of college students. Maryland,
Virginia and Washington, D.C.,are
transient high-income areas, and their
proximity to the state makes Pitt ac-
cessible to them.

Also, said Altomari, Pitt has many
ties to Florida. “There are a large
number of transplanted northerners, in
particular, Pittsburghers, in Florida,”
he said. “There are also 4,000 Pitt
alumni in southern Florida who really
talk up the university. That’s why the
[admissions] office has concentrated on
that area.”

Since the nationwide decline in ap-
plications, Pitt has not spent any more

 

time or money on recruitment. “We’ve
just looked at these other areas more
critically than before,” said Altomari.
“By becoming more selective, we’ve
spent the time we’ve had in those states
more wisely.”

Nationally, the older adults or non-
traditional students appear to be
responsible for stabilizing enrollment.
However, Pitt’s population still consists
primarily of the traditional student
(18-24 years old). “There has been a
slight increase in older students,” said
Altomari, “but our freshman popula-
tion still tends to be 18 years old. The
College of General Studies, however,
pays more attention to recruiting older
students.”

National figures are also revealing
that economically depressed areas have
higher enrollment rates, and Pitt does

appear to reinforce this find. The-

Law dean resigns
after budget dispute

By Michael Ashford

and
Michelle Zollner
The Pitt News

Dr. Richard J. Pierce, dean of the
University of Pittsburgh’s School of
Law, submitted his resignation to the
university administration Monday in
the face of what appears to be a long-
standing conflict between the dean and
the administration over law school
budget allocations.

“Broadly speaking,” Pierce said,
“the dispute is over the administra-
tion’s lack of budget support for the law
school.” .

Pierce is known to have had broad
plans for improving the law school —
including an expansion of the library
and improvements of the faculty —
which led to his asking for more money
from the administration.

Pierce’s request, however, did not
meet with a positive response. After
Pierce submitted his resignation,
Associate Provost Roger Ahlbrant said
yesterday in The Post Gazette, “It’s the

kind of request one would make if he
or she wanted a moral issue over which
he could resign.” Ahlbrant added, also
in the Gazette, “It was really a
ridiculous request on his part in terms
of our ability to respond.” '

The university administration has
reacted somewhat inconsistently to
Pierce’s resignation.

In an interview yesterday, Provost
Roger Benjamin said, “It’s his choice
and the result of a basic disagreement
over budget management. Dean Pierce
was an excellent academician, has done
a good job as dean, and the university
has suffered a great loss.”

In response to Associate Provost
Ah1brant’s remarks, Benjamin added,
“I regret and apologize for any com-
ments which may have emanated from
this office.”

Benjamin attended a law school
Steering Committee meeting last night
and will be meeting with the law school

faculty, ostensibly to discuss who will I

replace Pierce as dean.

There are ‘unconfirmed reports, 3

however, that the law school faculty
will make an effort to prevent Pierce
from ultimately leaving the university.

Fauntroy speaks out 1

against elitist spending    

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Congressman Walter» Fauntroy
warned students Monday night that the
major problem this nation faces is not
government overspending, but rather
too many tax breaks for the rich.

“Don’t let anyone tell you our
government spends too much money on
student loans,” he said, “when the rich
are getting drunk like foxes, using ex-
cess capital to exploit the cheapest labor
in the world.” Fauntroy, speaking to
a mostly black audience, was the first
to speak during a week-long series of
lectures being held in conjunction with
Pitt’s Black Week, which began last
Sunday.

“If government spending had been
our problem, then the cuts totalling
$280 billion would have solved our
problems,” he said.

Fauntroy said the tax breaks given
to the rich did encourage them to in-
vest, but they invested in foreign
markets. He said that the rich invested
in countries having the cheapest labor,
the countries that exploit their work
force.

‘ ‘And nowhere in the world is the ex-
ploitation more than in South Africa,’ ’
he said. “The ﬂight of American
capital, and the ﬂight of jobs to other
countries — that is the problem.”

Fauntroy said that jobs lost in Pitts-

burgh were the direct result of U._S. in-
vestment in South Africa. ‘ ‘The jobs

-1 .~ ;-ya 11.; '7:\I..l’J(.='U»Wﬁ.u. ,  ....1.—£ nan 131v» ,-‘-’— .L:VvI541

that left Homestead and Pittsburgh and
Gary, In. went to the steel millsjof
South Africa,” he said.

Fauntroy said that the apartheid
government in South Africa depends on
the United States for its financial sup-
port. “Apartheid, deﬁned, is a labor-
controlled system that feeds on cheap
labor and foreign investment,” he said.
“It is a system of social segregation and
political domination for the purpose of
economic exploitation.”

Fauntroy launched the current Free
South Africa movement last.
Thanksgiving, when he went to the
South African embassy in Washington,
D.C. He said that he threatened to oc-
cupy the building if the apartheid
government wasn’t immediately
abolished. Fauntroy was arrested and
taken out of the embassy in handcuffs.
He said that he timed the incident so
it could be covered by the network
nightly news.

Fauntroy’s civil rights activism
began in 1959, when he became Pastor
of New Bethel Baptist CHurch in
Washinton, D.C. He was later ap-
pointed by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
as director of the ,Washington Bureau
of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.

In 1971, Fauntroy was elected as a
delegate to represent Washington,
D.C. in the House of Representatives.
He still holds that position, and also is
the coordinator of legislation thrust and
co-chairman of the steering committee

' for the Free South Africa movement.

Liberian president’s army “crushes”coup attempt 

MONROVIA, Liberia — President
Samuel Doe said his army has crushed
an attempted coup led by the former
commander of the nation’s armed
forces. Doe said that the coup attempt
failed in a broadcast over a radio sta-
tion that had been held by rebels in the
capital. He spoke about 13 hours after
the coup had began.

In Washington, a state department
spokesman said there had been an an-
nouncement that the government had
been overthrown, and that the coup had
failed. He said it was not clear what
forces were in control of the West
African nation which was founded by
freed American slaves in 1847.

New efforts made
to free hostages

WASHINGTON — New efforts
were'being made yesterday to secure
the release of the six remaining
hostages being held in Lebanon. The
White House has said that it is willing
to hold “discussions" with the people
keeping the Americans hostages, but
also said that the United States will not
“negotiate.” White House foreign
policy spokesman Edward Djerejian
said the United States will not negotiate
concessions with terrorists or give in
to threatsor ransom demands.

Transplant patient
has heart difﬁculty

PHILADELPHIA — Hospital of-
ﬁcials say a human heart transplanted
into a six-year—old girl is only partly
functioning and the girl’s chances of
surviving are poor.

Melissa Thomas of West
Philadelphia underwent surgery at St.
Christopher’s Hospital shortly after a
human heart became available. Melissa
had congenital heart disease.

Officials say drugs were ad-
ministered to Thomas before the
surgery in an effort to reverse the
pulmonary problem, but she is not
responding to the treatment.

Doctors say the right side of her new
heart is not functioning properly
because of her condition, and she is be-
ing kept alive through the use of an ar-
tiﬁcial heart and lung machine.

UPI receives
takeover offer

WASHINGTON — Sources said
yesterday that a Mexican newspaper
publisher and a Houston real estate
developer had agreed to team up to pur-
chase United Press International, the
nation’s second largest news agency.
Publisher Mario Vasquez-Rana and Joe
Russo of Houston had been rivals in the
quest to buy the news agency, which
has been operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection for six months.
The sources said Russo agreed to
become a minority partner with
Vasquez-Rana.

After the two other bidders joined

S. African students’

 _

South Africa — Police were on guard
yesterday at schools in Cape Town
where some students attempted to en-

force a school bovcott with a gruesome
form of murder called a “necklace.”

Authorities said one black student who
refused to observe the anti-apartheid
boycott was dragged to a school yard,
and a gasoline-soaked car tire was

managed to kick his attackers and
escape before the tire was set ablaze.

Porn survives
voter referendum

CAMBRIDGE,Mass. — Voters had
the opportunity yesterday to decide if
victims of pornography should be able
to sue and collect damages from peo-
ple who make and distribute the porn-
ographic materials. This question was
put to them as a referendum.

The proposed ordinance deﬁned
pornography as “a systematic practice
of exploitation and subordination,
based on sex, which harms women. ”
Explicit photos, as well as anything
defined as dehumanizing to women,
"would be considered pornographic.

The proposal would have enabled
people who believed they had been vic-
timized by pornography to ﬁle civil
lawsuits. They could seek a court order
to stop the distribution of pornographic
materials and to collect cash settlements
from the makers and distributors.

Supporters argued the measure
would be an effective tool against pom-
ography and violence against women.
Opponents said the measure was too
vague and unconstitutional and could
be used to censor legitimate material.

Pitt chemistry prof receives award

Dr. Johannes F. Coetzee, professor
of chemistry at Pitt, was awarded the
Outstanding Achievement Award on
Oct. 25 in Bloomington, Minn., at the
annual meeting of the alumni society
of the University of Minnesota Institute
of ‘Technology.

The award recognizes former

students from the university who have .-

obtained distinction in their profes-
sions. It has been awarded to only 0.2
percent of graduates of the University
of Minnesota. Other recent recipients
include Stanford’s renowned heart
transplant surgeon, Dr. Norman
Shumway.

Coetzee joined the University of
Pittsburgh chemistry department in

1957 and quickly advanced to the rank
of full professor. In addition to
establishing himself as teacher and
leader at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels, Coetzee is also
a widely respected scientist who has
made major contributions to the

"understanding of non-aqueous solvents,

electrochemistry, ion-selective elec-
trodes and high-energy density battery
technology.

Holding bachelor of science and
master of science degrees from the
University of the Orange Free State,
South Africa, Coetzee received his
doctorate from the University of Min-
nesota in 1956 under the direction of
I.M. Kolthoff. During Coetzee’s

. career, he has edited three books and

published 85 technical papers. He has-
served the International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry as chairman of
the Commission of Electroanalytical
Chemistry and is currently a member
of the Analytical Division Committee.

Coetzee is a member of the Steering
Committee of the International Con-
ferences on Non-Aqueous Solutions.
He is also a member of the American
Chemical Society, an officer of the
Society for Analytical Chemists of
Pittsburgh and a member of the Pitts-
burgh Conference, the SACP organiz-
ing committee that arranges the world’s
largest meeting on analytical chemistry
and applied spectroscopy.

Royal Couple

Their Royal Highnesses, the Prince and
Princess of Wales, have arrived in America, and
for all the attention their little jaunt is receiving
you’d think they’d just discovered a cure for
AIDS. You may be asking: “What is it about
this fair couple that merits such tireless atten-
tion?” The answer is: Very little.

The royal family is a relic from an age past.
In a supposedly classless, democratic society its
continued existence is a paradox. Charles and
Diana are themselves useless; in no way can they
be considered productive members of British
society. Theirs is a position of unearned
privilege deriving not from worth or merit, but
rather from lineage and marital status.

Planted ﬁrmly in the lap of abundance and lux-
ury, the royal family is a slap in the faces of
the British people. Britain is a nation on the brink
of economic ruin. Its youth is confronted with
little hope of employmentand the prospect of
a dismal future of penury and hardship. Conse-
quently, they express their bitterness and frustra-
tion violently and the nation is in the grip of
social turmoil.

Yet it is the royal couple on whom the press
lavishes all its attention, and, in comparison, the
social and economic woes confronting Britain
are all but ignored. In this way the press is act-
ing irresponsibly.

It is the public that is, in large part, to blame.
Americans and people the world over have been
guilty of misguided, senseless celebrity-
gawking. Idolatry and a wretched afﬁnity for
scandal and gossip have warped our collective
values, and celebrities in general and the royal
couple in particular are accorded overrnuch ink
in the press. ‘

“E

Performance
A Counts "

After reading Bob Travers’ article
defending Foge Fazio (Nov. 6), I feel
compelled to make a few comments.

Yes, Mr. Travers, Foge Fazio is a
good man. I, myself, have entertained
thoughts of inviting him to my home
for Thanksgiving dinner. However, I

. fail to understand how you can believe

that being a good man leads to being
a good coach. I am a good man, but
I am not aspiring to be head coach of
the football team, although sometimes
I think I could do a better job.

If you believe that being good means
you will do well, I think you are in for
a rude awakening when you graduate.
This is the real world, Mr. Travers;
performance counts. Unlike his play-
ers, Fazio is being paid to perform.
This he has not done well. Yes, I am
saying that performing well means win-
ning. One certainly does not play to
lose.

I do not expect the Panthers to win
every game, nor do the Golden Pan-
thers, I’m sure. The problem is this:
With the amount of talent that exists on
this team, a 4-4-1 record is less than
acceptable. Last season is hardly worth
mentioning. I feel the alumni have a
right to pressure Fazio.

If a player performs poorly in a
game, Foge takes him out of the game.
Why should he be above "being
replaced?

Self-restraint

The series on abortion in The Pitt
News presented various angles and
views on this highly emotional topic.
Surely no one in their right mind thinks
of abortion as a positive good (except
the practitioners). And those of us who
see it as a grave moral tragedy can
understand how a woman may be
driven to it in desperation, as a quick
solution to a sorry mess.

But surely one of the most inane and
unfeeling comments on the subject is
the quote of Ms. Clark of the
Allegheny Women's Center, who gives
abortion counseling, cited in the Nov.
6 issue. Responding to the question,
“How does the woman make the right
decision?" she replied, “You can’t
make a wrong decision as long as you
are the one making it. This is a life-
enhancing "decision for the woman." ’ Is
this the kind ‘of trite jargon received by

Letters to the Editor

those who go to her for help?!

It is an insult to the intelligence of
a sensitive woman who must make a
desperately difficult decision about the
fate of her unwanted child to be told,
“You are taking control of your life.”
She surely knows she is faced with a
decision that will affect the rest of her
life, probably the gravest moral crisis
she has had to face,‘and is she to be
coddled with such pabulum? Hopeful-
ly she will find other wiser advisers to
help her think through her decision and
help her face her responsibility toward
the life she has conceived.

Taking a pragmatic view of the mat-
ter for a moment, how are we to think
about abortion? Many would say, if we
are to enjoy free sex, we must have an
easy abortion, since no contraception
is foolproof. Let’s look at that.
Premarital pregnancy is an unfortunate
yet essentially avoidable ' situation
because sex is avoidable — not easy to
resist but possible for one who makes
a mature decision in light of his values.
Sex is not necessary to life in the way
eating or sleeping are. Nor is it essen-
tial to happiness, since many have in
fact made the decision to wait until
marriage and do not seem any unhap-
pier for it. Maybe the contrary, for
missing out on “good times" is ‘com-
pensated for by dating relationships
open to more values than sexuality and
by an increase in self-respect. Friend-
ships with the opposite sex are more

satisfying, many find, where there is

an element of self-restraint.

If the man is responsible enough to
listen to his conscience rather than his
enzymes and to ask himself, “Do I
really care for this person, or am I us-
ing her as a consumer item? Do I want
to expose her to the risk of screwing
up her life, of having to get an abor-
tion for my sake or maybe having to
drop out of college?” it may cause him
to think twice. Men must also face their

ticular would be upset if a Jewish group
were to invite a speaker to campus who
spoke of black culture in a derogatory
manner and admired white racists
should be well-taken. '

As an undergraduate at the State

University of New York at Bingham- .

ton, I witnessed the consequences of
the Jewish Student Union’s decision to
invite Meir Kahane to speak during a
Jewish cultural awareness week. (For

those of you unfamiliar with Kahane,
he is the Brooklyn-born, Orthodox
Rabbi who founded-the terrorist Jewish
Defense League. He preaches against
Jewish assimilation and is particularly
insulting towards blacks and minorities
in general. In short, he is a racist. He
has since emigrated to Israel, where he
was elected to the Knesset on a plat-
form of forced expulsion of all Pales-
tinian from Isreal.)

As a result of Kahane’s’ visit, the
campus became a scene of angry
denunciations. intolerance, hatred and
violence. Through it all, the JSU
claimed their and Kahane_’s right of free
speech. So Kahane spoke.

The point made in Binghamton was
that, being that there were many Jewish
leaders who could have been invited to
speak, the choice to invite Kahane was
insensitive at best. The same is true for
the BAS’ decision to invite Farrakhan:
Why, given the fact that there are so
many black leaders who could have
been invited to speak, did the BAS
choose to invite this man who has of-
fended, angered and hurt so many
people?

_ As was the casein Binghamton, this
decision is not a statement of rights and
pride, but one of a lack of compassion
and sensitivity for the feelings of
others. Nov. 14, 1985 will be
remembered as a sad day for the

University of Pittsburgh. '

Racism

Question: Why is racism morally
contemptable when practiced by a
white person, but referred to approv-
ingly as the expression of “blackness”
or “ethnic pride” when practiced by
a black person? -

Would any rational person take me
seriously if I declared, “I’m proud to
be white? ?’Of course not — because
pride is an emotion that proceeds from
the learned not from an irrelevant
genetically determined characteristic.
The same goes for the statement “I’m
proud to be black.”

The rational person would not take
seriously the declaration, “All white
people are my brothers and sisters.”
For genuine human solidarity is based
upon a brotherhood of values,
regardless of skin color. The same
would apply to the statement, “All
black people are my brothers and
sisters.”

The above is in reaction the the
racism I see in our culture in general,
and in the “Letters” section of The Pitt
News in particular. Racism is evil
because it is irrational. Let’s stop this
silliness. _ -

The Pitt News, November 13, 1985

As black faculty members of the
university, Lloyd Bond, Thelma Mitch-
ell and I have been upset by the typical
scenario of a Farrakhan speech: He ar-
rives under a cloud of controversy and
tension; he delivers his speech which
is treated in a sensational fashion by the
media; he leaves town as the media
descend on black leaders and
spokesmen for their views.

We hope that this time the scenario
will be different. Rather than the media
grilling a few black leaders and
spokesmen, the entire university
‘community — faculty and students,
blacks, Jews and Gentiles — will come
‘together and discuss issues raised by
Farrakhan and his address. In this
manner we will be able to air these
issues in a reasoned, intelligent manner
and learn firsthand what things separate

us, what things unite us and why. The
forum can provide an alternative to im-
passioned statements and paid political
advertisements.

The issues to be discussed are many
and important. They include Far-
rakhan’s remarks about Judaism; they
involve appropriate and effective
strategies for black economic advance-
ment; they concern ways of maintain-
ing satisfactory relations among ethnic
groups. Issues raised by Farrakhan’s
approach touch at the core of inter-
ethnic sensitivities and_ relations: In
what situations and in what ways, for
example, can one ethnic group properly
criticize another? How can a minority
group maintain useful relations and
coalitions over some issues (e. g. , apart-
heid) while disagreeing over other
issues (e. g. , affirmative action)? The

issues also involve intra-ethnic rela-
tions: In what contexts and in what
ways can members of a minority group
criticize one of their own leaders
without seeming to repudiate or betray
the entire group? Issues raised by his
visit are also social and economic.
They concern the nature and feasibil-
ity of his economic program and why
it appeals to many in the black com-
munity. The issues include his rhetoric:
What is it about Farrakhan’s style and
symbolism that attracts some and in-
pfuriates others? The issues are
historical: Where does Farrakhan stand
in the long tradition of black na-
tionalism? What would Malcolm X,
were he alive today, say about Far-
rakhan and his program and
statements? These are some of the
issues and questions that such a forum

emerge in the course of the discussion.

In putting together this forum, we
have been heartened by the support
given us by the Black Action Society.
Hillel and the University Chaplains. All
three groups agreed to co-sponsor the
forum. Hillel deserves credit for their
willingness to engage in a dialogue
rather than engage in picketing and
demonstrations. The BAS deserves
credit for agreeing to participate in a
forum in which a number of panelists
may have critical things to say about
one of the keynote speakers of their
Black Week program. We will all

A deserve credit if we succeed in having

major issues raised and discussed by

‘ the entire university community in a

free and open forum. To the best of our

knowledge, this will be the first open '

forum to be held anywhere following

one of Farrakhan’s speeches.

The forum will be held on Friday,
Nov. 15, at 3 p.m. in L-9 Clapp Hall.
Faculty participants include (in
alphabetical order) professors William

Johnston (political science), Lloyd

Bond (psychology), Larry Glasco

(histofy), and Barbara Shore (School"

I have decided to take up a life of
crime.

This will come as no surprise to the
many of my friends and acquaintances
who have detected, under the affable,
carefree exterior, just a hint of
something sinister in the makeup of my
personality.

But the truth is this decision has
come about quite suddenly. I was at
home watching a movie on television
about a bunch of Spaniards who dragged
an enormous cannon hundreds of miles
so that they could annihilate their
beloved home city. -The next thing I
knew my thoughts were filled with vi-

sions of illegal behavior. Once made,
the career choice was irreversible.
Deciding to become a criminal is like
becoming a country music fan: It is
something that you never even think
about until one day it hits you over the
head, and you are permanently ﬁxated.
My first crime, I think, will be to
assassinate the Rev. Louis Farrakhan
when he speaks here. This is not to sug-
gest that I necessarily have anything
against the man. Indeed, I have no
opinion one way or the other in the
whole pointless, boring controversy.
But the public murder of a much-
discussed figure will start my career

with just the right bang of notoriety.

From there, after a few months of ly-
ing low in an ‘exotic Third World
locale, I will resurface in a harrowing
string of burglaries and purse snatch-
ings (perhaps spiced with a slaying or
two) that will leave the police hopeless-
ly bafﬂed. I will adopt some glamorous
alias or other, such as “the inscrutable
Mr. Wong.” Soon no one will trust
anyone else. People will start suspect-
ing their friends and lovers. Social
mayhem will grip the whole East End.

One crime that I have been longing
to commit is to mastermind an armed
invasion of the William Pitt Union. I

will hire a brigade of assorted Latin
American and Middle Eastern ter-
rorists, and we will hold the night
watchman hostage while eating, drink-
ing, smoking and putting our feet on
the furniture. We may even stay after
hours without passes.

Afterwards we will get hold of
several top administration ofﬁcials,
brainwash them to incoherency,
remove their clothing, shave off all
their hair, oil them down and ride
around on their backs yelling “Gid-
dyup! " We will then take them into the
square between Forbes Quad and the
library and execute them while singing

“We Are The World.”

The only drawback to all of this is
that it may become boring. In this event
the only possible course to follow will
be to retire and open a school for blind
policemen. I will still plant the odd
bomb or two in bus terminals,
however.

If all of this seems extreme to you, .

may I say in my defense that, for all
my vices, I have never been to Zelda’s.
Too expensive!

Women change the image of engineering

By Nadia Moritz

Features Editor

Rae is one of the guys — a chemical
engineer. But Rae wears contacts in-
stead of thick horn-rimmed glasses,
carries her calculator in her Gucci bag
and clips her mechanical pencil onto
the pocket of her Georges Marciano
blouse.

“I think women should be changing
the image of engineers,” said Rae Lyn

' Marburger, a senior engineering stu-.

dent at Pitt. “Why not? Women have
moved into the ﬁeld, and they’ve prov-
en themselves. I know I can compete
with the men.”

Rae is part of a national surge of
women into engineering, a surge that
has continued to consistently increase
for the last ten years. Across the coun-
try in the last decade, the number of
women earning engineering degrees

. has increased from 744 in 1974 to

4,716 in 1979 to 10,761 last year, ac-

cording to the Engineering Manpower‘

Commission. The number of female
engineers graduating from college in
1986 is likely to top 11,200, more than
14 percent of the nation’s engineering
graduates, according to Paul Doigan,
commission chairman.

Despite this year’s drop in the
percentage of female freshman
engineering candidates at Pitt (15.52
percent), the number of female
engineering graduates has been steadily

increasing. In the academic year
1969-1970, 13 out of 1,688 full-time
engineering students were women.
That’s .008 percent. '

In 1981-82, Pitt’s female engineer-
ing enrollment jumped to 22.4 percent,
one of the highest in the country. Last
year, although 19.5 percent of the
engineering graduates were women,
Pitt’s percentage stayed well above the
national norm.

Also, considering engineering lead-
ership positions at Pitt, women are
close to equality. Seven out of 16
members of the Engineering Student
Cabinet, 11 out of 20 representative to
the Student Council and 11 out of 27
of the Skyscraper staff are women.

“The surge of women into engineer-
ing in the 1970s was the time of the
new frontier,” said Lori Shuff, assis-
tant to the dean and director of
freshman programs and external af-
fairs. “At this time there were a lot of
women that went into engineering
because it was different. But now,
women no longer have to prove
themselves. They are accepted.”

Shuff’s own appointment to the
School of Engineering in 1982 was an
example of the forging of females into
a traditionally male career ﬁeld.

“When I started here, there was a
lot of controversy about whether a
female could handle this position, ’ ’ said
Shuff. “Could she talk about engineer-
ing? Could she counsel students? But

now nobody questions it. It all comes
down to what you do.”

Engineering comes down to the no-
tion that actions speak louder than
words, or at least louder than sex dif-
ferences, according to Shuff, because
of the mechanical solution orientation
of the work. For this reason, women
are realizing that the. rewards of the
engineering profession are for perform-

'ance and for taking advantage of the

opportunities.

“The need for engineers is enor-
mous,” said Shuff. “This country
needs new technology. The money is
good and the work is sexually un-
biased. You move and you move now.
If you can do the job —— terriﬁc.”

‘ ‘I think that it comes down to what
is on paper. They want end results,”
said Marburger. “Who is going to do
the quickest work?” Marburger decid-
ed she wanted to pursue engineering

early in high school, after realizing her

gifts for science and math.

Mary Louise Micklos is also a
chemical engineer. “If you can prove
yourself, I don’t think you will have a
problem,” said Micklos.

Lori Shuff agrees. “Faculty do not
look at female and male engineering
students differently, as long as they do
the work,” said Shuff. “The work is
all that matters.”

Sometimes there is a problem,
despite the overall acceptance of
women into this ﬁeld and the nonsex-

_‘‘I think women should be changing the image of
engineers. Why not? Women have moved into the ﬁeld,
and they have proved themselves. I know I can com-

pete with the men. ”

—Rae Lyn Marburger

Pitt chemical engineering student

ual orientation of the style of work.
Women are still reminded of their
pioneering status in the ﬁeld of
engineering, both in the class room and
in industry.

‘ ‘You have to do a little extra just to
get even with everyone else,” said
Marburger. “Women have a lot more
to prove, even if it's just to them-
selves.” .

“You have to work harder if you are
a woman, and it’s very intimidating,
especially when you are a freshman,”
said Michelle Vacarello, who is a
junior and the vice president of the
Society of Women Engineers at Pitt.
“For a woman to get the same respect,
she has to prove that she can do the
work. Also, the men don’t like the
women moving into their territory.”

The woman engineer’s constant need
to prove herself, according to
Vacarello, even extends into the
physical image of being a woman and
an engineer at the same time.

‘ ‘Sometimes you just have to act like

one of the guys. Dress in sweatshirts
and jeans and swear, just so you blend
in and they accept you more,” said
Vacarello,

Image, according to Shuff, is a
source of reluctance for females con-
sidering engineering as a career.

“What I see a lot in young women
that are thinking about going into
engineering is a fear of old
stereotypes,” said Shuff. “There is still
this attitude of ﬁtting into the engineer-
ing stereotype. If you are going to be
an engineer, then you should love
science and math and be ugly and want
to be shut in a cubicle the rest of your
life. The question these young women
keep asking is ‘how can I be an

engineer and myself at the same time?’ ” .

On the whole, educators say that they '

are ﬁnding evidence that female
engineering students are becoming
readily accepted by male faculty and

students.

The smell of turkey and stufﬁng
wafting from the oven, the whole
family is sitting around the table,
their mouths watering in anticipa-

you. Poor little you is sitting in your -

drumsticks, all because you
couldn’t get home for the holidays.

Couldn’t get home, you say?
Made your reservations too late?
Couldn’t afford the exorbitant
fares? Not to worry. It really isn’t
all that difﬁcult or expensive to get
home for the holidays, but the plan-
ning should start now.

The ﬁrst thing to do is decide the
dates of your little vacation. Hav-
ing a deﬁnite date in mind will
make it easier not only to make the
reservations via various modes of
transportation but to search out the
best bargains; Many airlines, bus
companies and train companies of-
fer discounts for certain seasons or
days of the week.

Next, you must make reserva-
tions. It is important to make them

To save you some of the time
and effort, here’s some research
already done for you. Since it was
impossible to print travel informa-

tion to every city in the continental
United States, all the following in— 4
formation pertains to trips to New
York, City, Philadelphia and
Chicago. ’

The three ways to get out of Pitts-
burgh — other than hitch-hiking or
carpooling — consist of trains,
planes or buses. Usually going via
the airways is the most expensive
method of travel but the fastest.

. Trains, while less costly, take
longer. The bus is usually the
cheapest but does tend to take a
longer time. Ultimately the method
of travel depends on your wallet.

There are many other airlines,
but for our study purposes USAir
was the one that serviced our three
survey cities. To ﬂy from Pitts-

4 burgh to the Big Apple, try their
Super Saver Plan. If you’re plan-
ning on traveling on weekdays, the
fare will be $152 round trip, tax in-
cluded. If you can ﬂy on the ,

planning ahead

weekend, the ﬂight will cost you
$130 round trip. Two ﬂights a day
leave from Pittsburgh International
Airport.

There are restrictions, however.
You cannot use the return ticket the
same day, and you must take the
return trip within 60 days. If you
should choose not to use the Super
Saver Plan, a ﬂight from Pittsburgh
to New York City would cost $198.

If Philadelphia is home base, the
Super Saver Plan will run you $186
round trip, tax included, for both
weekdays and weekends. But again
the restrictions are the same: You
must stay over a Saturday and stay
no more than 60 days. Another plan
includes a one-way ticket for $98
if you are willing to take the ﬁrst
or last ﬂight leaving Pittsburgh for
the City of Brotherly Love.

Although the hours seem bar-
baric, ﬂights are crowded, so make
your reservations as soon as possi-‘A

ble. The airline allows cancellations
without a penalty fee. There are 12
daily ﬂights to Philadelphia. A
decision to reject the Super Saver
Plan will cost you $248 for a round-
trip ﬂight.

If you call the Windy City home,

“At 1 1 our barrage and the enemy's
ceased. From purgatory to paradise in

sixty seconds.” This is from the Nov.

11. 1918, entry ofa diary kept by Sgt.
Fred S. Wertenbach, which currently
is on display in the Hall of Valor at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall.

An impressive museum of wartime
memorabilia, Soldiers and Sailors
graces the corner of Fifth Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard. This year marks
the 75th anniversary of the dedication
of the hall.

Since its presentation to the the
public as a monument to Allegheny
County‘s Civil War veterans, the
building and its grounds have served
many purposes. The halls 2.30()—seat
auditorium continues to be the site of

grams and religious services. Each
year, local high schools hold gradua-
tion ceremonies in the building. And
like it or not, the memorial’s sprawl-
ing lawn is a summertime mecca for
Oakland’s landlocked sun worshippers.
The main reason for the existence of
the four-acre memorial, however, was
confirmed at the 1963 rededication of
the building to the memory of all
veterans from all wars or armed con-
ﬂicts “in which the United States has
been or may hereafter be engaged.”
Though the fatalism is obvious in

those words, Bruno Krsul, director of

various concerts, lectures, film pro—-

Director of Soldiers and Sailors Hall

the hall, pointed out that the purpose
of the building is a plain and simple
one. “Whether it‘s right, wrong.
whatever. we're here after the fact as
a tribute to the veterans who served."
he said.

In terms of size. the tribute paid by
Soldiers and Sailors is a massive one.
The members of the Grand Army of the
Republic, the organization of Civil War
veterans who initiated the idea for the
memorial. definitely were not in-
terested in a small memorial or one
similar to today‘s Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington. D.C.

Intent on building a memorial “of a
character so imposing and impressive
as to represent the wealth, intelligence
and patriotic sentiment of our great in-
dustrial center,” a design for the
building was chosen based on the
Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of
the seven wonders of the world.

The building is 240 feet wide across
the front and 210 feet deep. The peak
of its pyramidal roof is 106 feet above
Fifth Avenue and is topped with four
winged lions. Over the main entrance
to the building, a statue representing
America stands guard.

121 OAKLAND AVENUE. 4624-8801

in addition to that statue, two others
— one representing a Civil War soldier
and the other a sailor — ﬂank the three
entrance doorways at the top of the
long front walkway. .

Combined with the other adornments
surrounding the hall. the grounds of the
monument are practically a memorial
in their own right. Twin 10-inch can-
nons. built in 1844 and used as coastal
defense weapons. stand on either side
of the main walkway. Cement—ﬁlled ar-
tillery shells mark each of the three
walkway entrances. A ship's bell from
the U.S.S. Pittsburgh was mounted on
the front patio in 1979, and a
3,000-pound, 20—foot—long torpedo was
added in 1984 to honor the 52 sub-
marines and their crews that were lost
in World War II.

The same splendor that adorns the
outside of the building is also apparent
inside the memorial. The 65-foot—high
ceiling in the auditorium is ornately

sculptured and equipped with a hidden.

lighting system that adds to the
opulence of the room by its visible
absence. Across the back wall of the

‘stage is a 70 x 18-foot rendering of the

in its size and content. The walls ofthe
surrounding hallway are hung with 61
plaques which list the names and ranks
of the more than 25,000 men from
Allegheny County who served in the
Civil War. Glass display cases also line
these corridors and offer an interesting
glimpse at the artifacts of past wars as
well as the personal effects of the many
men and women who played a part in
them.

Battle ﬂags, helmets, riﬂes, diaries,
shaving kits and other items have been
donated by the public for permanent
display in the hall. Some of the more
recent displays include several cases
devoted to the war in Vietnam, a black
military veteran display, a display
relating to the women of the Civil War
and the newest display —— the U.S.S.

Pittsburgh Room of Navy
Memorabilia, which features a
memorial to “The Lost 52  ” sub-

marines of World War II and the 3,505
men who lost their lives on them.

Perhaps the most impressive display
at Soldiers and Sailors is the recently
renovated Hall of Valor. The Hall of
Valor is a small, solemn room
dedicated to Allegheny County men
who distinguished themselves in the
service and were awarded some of this
country’s highest military awards, in-

Cross and the Medal of Honor.

The walls of this room are lined with
individualized plaques detailing the ex-
ploits of the men honored there, such
as Cpl. Samuel Llwellen, one of a
group of six men to be first awarded
the Medal of Honor, and Capt. Michael
Estocin, who was declared “presumed
dead” 10 years after his plane crashed
in Vietnam.

Despite the historical appeal of the
hall, there has been some criticism
directed at it over the years. Most
recently, there were some charges that
the hall was virtually a white elephant
draining money from the county while
serving no specific purpose and allow-
ing its museum displays to fall into
disrepair.

According to Krsul, though, those
days are in the past. “I think people
are looking for this kind of place to
hold onto,” he said. “I don’t think you
could get rid of it today if you wanted
to.”

The hall receives an operating budget
of approximately $400,000 a year, said
Krsul. In return, all rental fees paid to
the hall are directed back into the coun-
ty’s general fund. in all the years of the
hall’s existence, it has yet to have a
self-sufficient year.

“We do our best here,” Krsul said.
“We do our best to be cooperative and
helpful, community-wise, public

Women Engineers

continued from page 7

Joe ‘Samosky agrees. Having ob-
tained a BS in electrical engineering
last year from Pitt, he is presently
working on his degree in behavioral
neuroscience on theeway to a Ph.D. in
bioengineering. '

“For me it would seem more strange
if there weren’t so many women doing
this,” said Samosky. “I’m not preten-
tious enough to speak for an entire
generation, but now, at least in the
classroom, it’s in no way unusual for
women to be there.”

“There is a loss in productivity if
you have the exclusion of one sex. You
don’t get a well-rounded experience.
There have been studies suggesting that
men and women think differently. but
that is all the more_ reason to encourage
both. You need both to get the full
human potential.”

Whether women are viewed as equal
partners in the classroom or not, this
partnership changes as they move into
the working world and confront in-
dustry and industry personnel.

“The problem comes when women
get out of the classroom,” said Shuff.
“The numbers are different, less equal,
and the people begin to look at you as
women ﬁrst, and an engineer second.”

Women are getting the jobs and the
commanding salaries. Among women
who recently graduated with engineer-
ing degrees, 81 percent have found jobs
in industry, 10 percent hold govern-
ment jobs and 5 percent are teaching,
according to the Engineering Man-
power Commission. . A

The salaries achieved by women
engineers have almost doubled in the
last 10 years, according to a 1983-84
survey by the Society of Women
Engineers. .

In terms of treatment, especially in
heavy industry, Shuff believes there ex-
ists a difference for women. “There
are some instances in industry, like
sales, when women have to sell to peo-
ple that are used to dealing with men
and equating competence with being
male.”

Marburger found this to be true.
Working for PPG’s coatings and resins
division over the past summer, she en-
countered some “sexually derogatory
treatment. ”

‘ ‘The problems weren’t with the peo-
ple I worked for, or the engineers I
worked with. It was the other people
—— like the maintenance people — they
really didn’t want me there,” said Mar-
burger. “At first it bothered me, but
since they were not the ones that were
evaluating me on my performance, it
didn’t bother me." '

Micklos has encountered sexually
differentiated treatment during inter-
views as well.

“I’ve gone to interviews already
where the interviewer will ask you if
you are sure that you don’t mind get-
ting dirty,” Micklos said. “ ‘You’re
a girl. Are you sure you want to do
this?’ I was offended, but what could
I do — you certainly can’t express that
in the interview.”

The female engineer plays a smaller
role in academia than in industry. As
Samosky noted, “On our faculty there
are only two women. Things like that
keep reminding you that in the past,
men dominated the ﬁeld.”

According to Dr. Donna Blackmond,
who teaches in Pitt’s Chemical

Engineering Department, moving"

female engineers into academia is a
matter of — evolution.

Dave Hooker/The Pitt News
‘ ‘When I started here, there was

a lot of controversy about

whether a female could handle else. Women have a lot more to
this position  . It allcomes prove, even if it’s just to
down to what you do. ” .. themselves. ”

’ —Lori Shuﬁ’ —Rae Lyn Marburger

Assistant to the Dean

 

  

Dave Hooker/The Pitt News .1
“You have to do a little extra
just to get even with everyone

Pitt Chemical Engineering Student

“It took a while for women to think
about engineering as a BS, and it will
take a little longer for them to think
about going to graduate school,” said
Blackmond.

This lack of women in the classroom
leads to a lack of female engineering
role models.

“There just aren’t anyfemale role
models for the women engineering
students,” said Blackmond. “I’m the
only woman professor in my depart-
ment, and nationally about one percent
of chemical engineering professors are

women.”

Shuff has noticed a change in the
number of female role models in sec-
ondary education’s math and science.

“I have seen a deﬁnite increase in
the number of women that are science
and physics teachers,”— said Shuff.
“That kind of thing is happening and
young women are realizing that you
don’t have to be a man to be good at
physics.”

Creating opportunity for potential
female engineers is an area that Shuff
is planning to focus her efforts on in

the near future. She is presently plan-
ning a summer program, involving
sixth-grade girls in a series of engineer-
ing-related courses at Pitt.

“This is when the socialization proc-
ess begins to affect women. Up until
sixth grade, male and female math and
science aptitudes are equal,” said
Shuff. .

“After that, young women become
more concerned with being cute and
charming and pleasing the male math
and science teachers. I want to get them
before this starts to happen.”

“Pitt basketball may be the hottestticket in twn

Chaz Palla/ The Pitt News

Pitt lines up under the lights when it hosts Penn State Nov. 423

The hottest ticket in town can now"

be found at the University of Pittsburgh
for the upcoming Panther basketball
season. With less than two weeks
before the start of its regular season
schedule, the Pitt ticket office has been

very busy with current sales. Kimball ,

Smith, the coordinator of ticket sales
and promotions, commented on the
availability of Pittsburgh’s hottest
sports item. “We’re very excited to say
that we have just approximately 125
season tickets left for Pitt Panther
basketball for the 1985-86 season,”
said Smith. ' .

With this year’s overwhelming’

response, the Panthers will have set a
season ticket sales record for the fourth
straight year.

It’s quite ironic that during a 1981
news conference announcing Pitt’s in-
ception to the Big East conference,
Commissioner Dave Gavitt made an in-

. credible prediction that within three

seasons the general public wouldn’t be
able to purchase a ticket for a Panther
home league game. Though that in-
credible prophecy was only off by one
year, the fact is, ithas become a reality.

Commissioner Gavitt reflects back
on his claim that Pittsburgh would buy
Big East basketball..“It probably was
a prophetic quote as it turned out,” said
Gavitt. “I just felt that when Pitt came
into the league, given Roy'Chipman’s
considerable reputation as a coach and

‘ what he had already accomplished in

 

some more difficult circumstances, and
given what had been happening around
the league with the other programs in

addition to what Pitt would do — I’m
not real surprised that it had happened

"at Pitt. All the real ingredients were

there; they just needed a little better
v eh i c l e. ’ ’

Since the day Pitt accepted its addi-
tion to the Big.East conference, the pro-
gram has escalated in dramatic fashion.
Not only has the name of Pitt basket-
ball been cast in the spotlight of the
conference itself, but the Pitt program
is now on the entire nation’s mind. This
has come about from the dedicated ef-
forts of many people.

Head coach Roy Chipman is quite
aware of the long and hard work that
has transpired in the short period since
1981. Chipman himself commented,
“We accepted the challenge that Dave
Gavitt gave us here four years ago. The
university administration dedicated
themselves, Dr. Bozik dedicated
himself, and I dedicated myself to hav-
ing the best competitive program we
could have at this university and that’s
exactly what we’ve done.” .

Like any other big-time basketball
program, it doesn’t stop here. The pro-
gram itself must continue to strive for-
ward in every facet in order to be the
best it can be, and Dr. Roy Chipman
is no stranger to that work ethic.

“We’re very pleased with the way
the direction of the program has been
going,” said Chipman. “We are mov-
ing in the right direction, but we’re not
satisfied where we are. We’re going to
continue to get better and continue to
recruit and build our program up.”

As for the immediate improvements
of this fine program, it will be in-
teresting to see how this year’s squad

E SPN to
televise
the game
nationally

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

The Pitt Athletic Department yester-
day announced that the Nov. 23
meeting between archrivals Pitt and
Penn State has been moved from the
original afternoon starting time to
Saturday at 7:45 p.m.

The move stems from the decision
by ESPN to televise the 85th meeting
between the two Eastern powers.

Pitt head coach Foge Fazio had mixed
feelings about the change.

. “Well, I think that naturally our
players like to play on national televi-

sion,” Fazio said. “Ijust hope that the

Page 13

Pitt and Penn State may play at night

weather is nice. I would rather play the
game at 1:00 in the afternoon, but that
is the way it’s going to be.”

There is one added hitch to the en-
tire deal. Should ABC decide to
televise the game, then it would be
switched to 3:45 in the afternoon.

Right now, the arrangements for the
game will be much the same as they
were for the Pitt—Purdue game that
opened the 1985 season. Musco Cor-
poration will provide temporary
lighting, justas it did in Pitt’s 31-30
win over Purdue. Fazio would like to
end the season the same way he started
11.

“I hope we can finish like we
began,” Fazio said, adding. “It would
be nice."

According to Pitt Assistant Athletic
Director Dean Billick, the offer to
televise the game was made a while
ago, but the ﬁnal decision was held up
until Penn State decided to approve the
telecast.

“The offer came from ESPN about
two weeks ago,” Billick explained.
“Penn State was slow in giving its per-
mission to move the game. Their ap-
proval came today.”

The temporaiy lighting will cost each

school around $25,000, down a small
amount from the $35,000 both Pitt and
Purdue paid in the opener.

Should everything go as planned, this
will be the second night game in the
history of Pitt Stadium.

Shepherd leads Pitt
ﬂock into Big East

By Mike Bartoletti
For The Pitt News

PITTSBURGH — Darryl Shepherd
has an excited look on his face when
you mention this year’s University of
Pittsburgh basketball team.

“I think we will be a good team,”
Shepherd said. “I think this team could
beone of the best teams that Pitt has
ever had.”

He is confident. Why shouldn’t he
be? The Panthers return Big East
Rookie of the Year Charles Smith and
six other players who had some ex-
perience as starters last season on a
team that competed in the NCAA Tour-
-nament last spring.

' Pittsburgh coach Roy Chipman also
shares Shepherd’s confidence. “We
probably have better overall talent and

. depth this year than we’ve had since

I’ve been here,” said Chipman, who
is beginning his sixth season as head
coach of the Panthers. “We have the
makings of being a good team.”

The 6-6 Shepherd came on strong
late last season to take some of the load
off Smith. Shepherd started the ﬁnal
five games and was the team’s second
leading scorer during that period. “I
want to pick up where I left off last
season,” said Shepherd with a grin. “I
felt very conﬁdent that I could do what
I wanted last year on the court. I feel
like I can do that again this season.”

Right now Shepherd appears to have
the inside track on the starting forward
spot ahead of Parade All~America
Jerome Lane.

Shepherd enjoys the challenge that
Lane poses. “Jerome is a very good
player,” Shepherd said. “When I prac-
tice against him, I feel like I am playing
against David Wingate every day. He
is that good. Hopefully Jerome will
make me a better overallplayer, and
I will make him one. The competition
between us is good.”

Shepherd is a multi—talented athlete.

_He qualified for the NCAA track
championships in the hurdles two years
"ago. Yet the senior forward ﬁnds time
for other outlets away from sports. “I
really enjoy music,” Shepherd said. “I
get the same satisfaction playing music
as I do turning the crowd on with a

breakaway dunk. Music excites me. "
Shepherd is an accomplished pianist
and saxophonist. He studies the sax-
ophone at Pitt. Though he plans on ob-
taining an information science degree
in April, he admits that music is his
first love. “I do not want to work all
my life nine to five,” Shepherd said.
“I always had the dream of being a
musician. I want to try it; I do not want
to think of what could have been.”
Shepherd is also determined to make
his senior season at Pitt one to
remember. “I think we have a chance
to be an excellent team, but we have
to continue to work toward achieving
our, goal of finishing in the top three
of the Big East,” Shepherd said. “As
for the NCAAs, I feel that we have a
good shot as long as Charles Smith'is
around. I have always dreamed of
playing with a player of Srnith’s abili-

Shepherd is confident about the
season, and if he can spread that con-
fidence to the rest of his teammates, it
will bring music to the ears of Panther
fans everywhere.

For The Pitt News

This week’s Pitt News Athlete of
the Week is Pitt swimmer Susan
Hickman. Hickman, a junior from
Orlando, Fla., qualiﬁed for the
NCAA nationals in the 50-meter
freestyle this past weekend.
Hickman’s qualifying time (23.70)
was recorded at Trees Pool in the
Lady Panthers’ win over Virginia.

The victory over Virginia com-
pleted a sweep for the Lady Pan-
thers in their ﬁrst two meets of the
season (the Lady Panthersromped
Kent State on Friday). The Virginia
meet was especially gratifying for
Hickman. i

‘‘I’m pleased,” she said. “I was
hoping to do it [qualify] this early
in the season because I want to
achieve some of the other goals I’ve
set for myself. Now I can concen-
trate on getting a better time [in the
50-meter freestyle] .- ’ ’

Athlete of the Week
Susan Hickman

Hickman, who qualiﬁed for the
Olympic trials her freshman year,
is a two-time All-America in the
50-meter freestyle. She placed
fourth and eighth at the NCAAS the
last two years. Also, Hickman is
the Pitt and Big East record holder
in the 50-meter. At last season’s
Big East Championships, she won
the 50- and 100-meter freestyle
events and was a member of the
Lady Panthers’ winning 200-meter
medley, 200-meter freestyle and
400—meter freestyle relay teams.

Hickman, a business major, has
already had a successful career at
Pitt, but she is only concerned with
the season ahead. “I would like to
qualify in the 100-meter freestyle,”
she said. “A lot of my goals coin-
cide with the team’s goals. I want
to be part of our relay teams that
could qualify for the N CAAs. That
would be very exciting.”

The Sportiilg Life

A The Pitt News, Novemberl3, 1985 '

By Bob Travers

Flyer goalie’s accident makes one stop and think

Let us die young

Or let us live forever

We don 't have the power
But we never say never
Sitting in a sand pit

Life is a short trip

I want to be forever young
Forever young

_ AlphaVille, I984

Pelle Lindbergh, the Philadelphia
Flyers goaltender, was only 26 years
old last Saturday when his car slammed
into a building outside of Philadelphia.
Lindbergh, as I write this, is in a New
Jersey hospital, brain dead, alive by the
narrowest of threads. He will die when
life support systems are taken off him.
It could be a few hours or a few days.

It hardly matters now that Lindbergh
was among the very best of NHL
goaltenders. That fact merely adds
poignancy to the cruelest of ironies —
death at a young age.

The death of anyone before his time
is terrible and for me, frightening. I

Na

think too often those of us who are of
college age tend to think of ourselves
as immortal. Death is something that
happens only to others. As long as we
study, we will stay alive. When you’re
20 years old, it’s hard to think of
yourself as an old man, much less dead.
And that is why the death of somebody
like Lindbergh shakes me up so much.
It reminds us more than we would like
to know, that we are not immortal and
if Pelle Lindbergh could die, then so
can we. It reminds us that there is no
such thing as “too young to die” and
there is nothing we can do to stop in-
evitable death.

So Pelle Lindbergh is dead. It makes
me wonder about a lot of things, not
the least of which is what am I doing
in college, preparing myself for a
lifetime I may not even have. What
point is there in learning trigonometry
or Russian history if I’m going to be
dead at 26. For most of us, 26 is not
that far away.

One of the reasons I find the death
of an athlete so particularly hard to take
is because of the sharp contrast between
death and sport. Sport is a celebration
of the things that give life its richness.

It is a symphony dedicated to graceful
and strong body movements. To run,
to throw, to catch, to try, to win, to
lose; these things are the essence of be-
ing physically alive. And to see some-
one who excels at one of those activities
adds to our enjoyment and appreciation
of the game.

Sometimes we forget that athletes are
people and not just a number or a posi-
tion. The athlete can be greedy or car-
ing or selﬁsh or in love. The death of
a young athlete seems like a betrayal
of the natural order of things. That one

so gifted should be forced to leave »

when he is at his best goes against
everything we were ever taught about
sports. Athletes don’t die, they retire.
People die.

The greatest melancholy is caused by
the unanswered questions “Why?” and
“For what purpose?” It was just about
a year ago that Ben Wilson, one of the
best high school basketball players in
the country, was killed on the street in
front of his school. He was attacked by
a street gang and left to die on the
street. He was 17 years old. It has been
a year now and “Why?” still falls like
a teardrop over the memory of his short
life. There probably is no reason for
his death that we can ever understand.
Pointless was his death, but so worth-
while was his life.

And so the athlete comes before us,
he ﬂutters beautifully for an instant,
like a butterﬂy on a crystal spring after-
noon; he dazzles, then is gone. Van-
ished into the night, into the cold
winter, into death.

For some the brilliance was too great
to be forgotten. The elegance of Rober-
to Clemente, the power of Lou Gehrig
and the human spirit of Terry Fox will
always be remembered. They are ones
we can never forget.

Somehow, in a different world,
where everything is good and
everything is clean we would under-
stand and we would not be afraid when
we heard about the death of a young
athlete. But in this world, we can only
wonder and go on. Sports in that sense
are reassuring. There is always next
week, next game, next year. There is
no death in sport, only losses.

And in the end, the only thing the
fans of sport can do when a hero dies
is hope for tomorrow and the day after
and smile about the past when he was
there. That, and remember the young
athlete as he was, frozen in time,
forever young.

(Editor ’s Note: At publishing time,
we received the news that Pelle Lind-
bergh had died after being taken oﬂ life
support systems. His organs are going
to be donated for transplantation.)

F;

5‘ never again play football in a New

week 10

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer
There are 41 ticks left on the
scoreboard clock. Miami ball, second
down and four at the 50-yard line. Jets
leading 17-14. Orange bowl crowd in
a tense frenzy. Dolphins file from the
huddle. Marino calls signals, audibles,
Lsifts back into the pocket.‘ Lofts a pass

‘Thigh into the muggy, night air. The

crowd holds its breath. Duper streaks
down the right sideline. Juggles the ball
for what seems an eternity, then clamps
on. Touchdown. Extra point. Miami
21-17. End of suspense, end of the Jets.

New Orleans coach Burn Phillips

reportedly tossed nose tackle ‘Tony

Elliot off the team midway through the
Saints’ 27-3 loss to Seattle. According
to Saints linebacker Rickey Jackson,
Phillips yanked Elliot out of the game
and chastised him for his uninspired
performance. As Elliot complained of
being chop-blocked by the Seattle
players, Phillips told him that he would

Orleans uniform. Sounds like an act of
desperation on Bum’s part. With the
Saints at 3-7, Phillips will probably do
anything to keep himself out of the
unemployment line.

David Woodley, the newest starting
quarterback of the Steelers has thrown
some punch and excitement «into the
Pittsburgh offensive scheme. The
former LSU star threw for 258 yards
and one touchdown in piloting the
capricious Steelers to a 36-28 romp
over the Kansas City Chiefs. His play
selection was much more effective than
Mark Malone’s philosophy of Hey
Diddle Diddle, Pollard Up the Middle.

John Stallworth, who led the team in

I ‘receiving with 126 yards, thrilled the

Arrowhead Stadium crowd with one of
the most astonishing combinations of
acrobatics and concentration ever seen

‘ on the football field. Engaged in a

C‘

. 15y



footrace with Chief cornerback Albert
Lewis, Stallworth leaped high for a
Woodley pass and tipped the slightly
overthrown ball in the air. Falling to
the turf, he managed to bat it up a sec-
ond time with his right hand. Then,
after landing hard on his back, Stall-
worth cuddled the dying football into
his hands as Lewis, ﬂat on his stomach,
gazed on in disbelief. Truly one of the
great catches-of all time.

Wanted: A “quick” and easy way
to end a.tight football game. Look no
further than Philadelphia wide receiver
Mike Quick, who burned the Atlanta
Falcon pass defense for a stunning
99-yard touchdown early in overtime
to lift the Eagles 23-17. Quarterback
Ron J aworski, planted deep in his end-
zone, hit the elusive Quick at the
Eagles’ 20-yard line and watched his

teammate sprint 80 yards for the win-‘

ning score. _

The L.A. Raiders learned an impor-
tant lesson this past Sunday: Never try
to outscore a healthy San Diego
Charger team. Unfortunately, Tom
Flores’ nasties found out the hard way

as the Chargers overwhelmed the '

Silver and Black with 573 total yards
and captured a 40-34 win. Charger
quarterback Dan Fouts wasn’t just hot;
he was incendiary, ripping the vaunted
Raider pass defense for 436 yards and
four touchdowns. All-purpose back
Lionel “Little _Train” James, a 5-6
whirlwind, laid the Raiders to rest with
a 17-yard spurt into the endzone less
than four minutes into overtime. It was
San Diego's ﬁrst win over the Raiders
in four years. .
A Trivial Pursuit question: Who is
_the quietest, first-place team in the
NFL? Hint — they play in the
Meadowlands. Well, everyone knows
about the J ets, so how about the Giants?
In first place? Correct, roll again.
Bill Parcell’s Giants are tied with
Dallas at 7-3 atop the NFC East and
have been silently smothering their op-
ponents with a pummeling defense.
Recently activated linebacker Carl
Banks will stuff the tightly packed
Giants’ defensive cannon just in time
for the divisional stretch run.

Luxbacher reﬂects on successful soccer season

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

If you wanted to know what the key
to success of the University of Pitts-
burgh soccer team this year was, you

would not look for individual
performances.
Sure, the Panthers ﬁnished the

season 11-4-2 thanks to some top
caliber athletes, but there is much more
to which the success can be credited.

Teamwork and the right attitude is
what made the Panthers winners, ac-
cording to Coach Joe Luxbacher. No
matter who appeared to be the star in
any of the games this season, that per-
son was always willing to give ‘the
credit to his teammates. Whether it be
a forward who scored two goals say-
ing that the key was the defense or the
defender saying the key was the for-
ward, you could always be sure of one
thing — none of these athletes thought
they were the key.
A “We relied heavily on teamwork this
season,” said Luxbacher. “While we
had strong individual performances, we
did not really have a superstar.
Everyone contributed to the effort.
Each win was a team win.”

Before the season ever began, Lux-
bacher knew his team had a long road

 

ahead of them in order to obtain the
team’s goal — to make it to the Big
East Championship playoffs.

The schedule was a tough and com-
petitive one, full of Big East action, and
the Panthers responded to it like true
winners. They went out on the ﬁeld and
gave it their all.

The Panthers jumped out early to a
4-0 record before suffering a 2-1 over-
time defeat at Bucknell. The Panthers
then won four straight games, including
Big East victories over Villanova (2-1)

Panthers tied a tough West Virginia
team (0-0) and lost to national power
Penn State (3-0). The Panthers won the
Southern Division of the conference
beating Georgetown (3-0) and St.
John’s (1-0).

‘ ‘We made a lot of progress over last
year,” Luxbacher commented. “We
knew we would have a tough schedule.
Looking back I wouldn’t think we
would have gone 4-0 in the Big East.
I knew we would do well and would
have a shot at the conference cham-

and Seton Hall (4-2). On the road the

    

 

‘Uzoma Chibundu

pionships, but I doubted we would be

Brian Casey

undefeated. ’ ’

The Panthers achieved the goal they
set and went to the Big East Champion-
ships. Pitt lost to eventual Big East
champs Syracuse 2-0 in a game that
was typical of the Panthers’ season —
it was a hard-played team effort. Senior
defenders Brian Casey and Uzoma
Chibundu were rewarded for their
strong play when they were named All-
Big East‘.

Another senior whoreally made a
difference was goalie Dave Torrence.
In 17 games Torrence and the defense
held opponents to 13 goals, an average
of .76 goals per game. Torrence also
set Pitt records for most shutouts in a
season( 10) and career shutouts(23).

The scoring attack was led by senior
Vic Hugo who finished with five goals
and six assists. Junior Bob Howard was
second for the Panthers with five goals
and three assists.

“The combination of a lot of dif-
ferent players is what made the dif-
ference,” Luxbacher said. “It is hard
to point out who played the best
because everyone played well. I was
pleased with the contribution made by
some of our freshmen. It ‘is hard to tell
if they will contribute right away or if
it will take them a year to adjust. They
really came through, though.

“Overall I was pleased with the ‘

season. We have come a long way.”

Now, if only they had an element of

consistency in their offense. What’s

that, Coach Ditka? Play Lawrence
Taylor where?

Just as the Redskins were about to
make their assault on first place in the
NFC East, a posse of leathery
wranglers from down Dallas-way rode
into the nation’s capitol and put down
the uprising. Led by Jim Jeffcoat and
Randy White, two tough ’pokes who
staked their claims deep in the trenches
of the carnage, the Cowboys kept the
Redskin aggressors out of the endzor‘<:
but once and pillaged the home_team’§
backﬁeld all afternoon. The Cowboys
scored on two Raphael Septien ﬁeld
goals and on a 48-yard touchdown from
a gringo known as Danny White to Lit-
tle T_ony Dorsett. '

TO Louis FARRAKAN

The Pitt News, November 13, 1985

AND ALL MEMBERS or THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY,

“There is no place in our society, nor in our electoral process for the hateful, bigoted expressions of anti-_Jewish
and racist sentiments such as those reportedly being made by Louis Farrakhan and all such vicious expressions

must be condemned.”

United States Senate Amendment 3363 6/28/1984

“Whereas, the Student Government Board is in concurrence with the U.S. Senate (Amendment 3363) that there
is no place in our society for hateful, bigoted expressions of anti-Jewish and racist sentiments such as those reportedly

being made by Louis Farrakhan; and,

Whereas, the Board is of the unanimous conviction that the above mentioned sentiments are antithetical to this 
University’s purposes and goals as well as being morallyvrepugnant:

Therefore be it resolved that‘ the Student Government Board condemns all suchgcious expressions and,

Be it further resolved that the Board call upon the Black Action Society and any other student organization which
seeks to provide a forum for Louis Farrakhan to immediatley repudiate in writing the sentiments and expressions of

hatred reportedly made‘ by Mr. Farrakhan.”

University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board March, 1985

AS MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY ANDAS STUDENTS OF THE
CONSTITUTION AND LAWSOF THE UNITED STATES WE CANNOT REMAIN SILENT IN

THE FACE or RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM. WHILE wE ARE COMMITTED TO THE   

FREE EXPRESSION AND EXCHANGE OF IDEAS ON CAMPUS WE FEEL MORALLY BOUND
TO CONDEMN THE RACIST AND ANTI—SEMITIC STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO LOUIS

FARRAKHAN WHO WILL BE SPEAKING
