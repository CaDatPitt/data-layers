Reason for the transfer was

Hemmed In

A student who drives to school and arrives later than 8:15
in the morning is a lucky person, if he ﬁnds a vacant parking
spot in the free lot in Schenley Park. He has to pull into the
spot quickly, or someone will beat him to it.

But on at least three days before the term ends, the late
morning and early afternoon student—motorist is going to be
astonished by the emptiness of the plaza; unsuspecting, he'll
pull into a roomy vacancy and walk happily to his classes.

Raring to get home,’ this happy motorist will hustle from
the University, glance toward his car, stop, and begin to
curse loud and long. For his car, practicallythe sole occupant
of the lot when he parked" it, is now coinpletely’hidden among
thousands of cars overflowing the plaza. \Vhere are the driv-
ers of all these automobiles? “latching the Pirates play ball
in Fo.rbcs Field.

This is not a “this could happen to you” illustration. Noth-
ing so impositive. Flt will happen to you, if you don’t make a
note of the daytime games at Forbes Field before the end of
the semester. -

, Next ‘Wednesday afternoon the Buccos play New York.
Thursday they meet.Bost.on in a daylight game. Again on May
 the Pirates have an afternoon coutest- scheduled. Remember.

Two years ago University officials and the Pittsburgh
police reached an agreement about use of the Schenley area

for parking. The City agreed to line off the lot, so that as

much parking space could be used without blocking any cars
in the lot so drivers could get out when they wanted to.

But days of baseball games at Forbes Field were set as
exceptions. On those days vehicles were to be permitted to
pile up bumper-to-bumper to preventoverload parking on the
Oakland streets. Students were to be warned to get ‘their cars
out before. the ‘fans started arriving. « .

Take this hint, if you don’t. want to sit out a game in
your “marooned” car.

 

gﬂer

There have been a lot of changes made this year on the
students’ social calendar, most of them for the better. The
“streamlining” of Scholars’, Day and Tap Day, for instance.

Banquet planners could welltake a lead from the results
of these programs. The usual Scholar’s day assembly with its
succession of speakers was dropped and replaced by individual
orators speaking singly in various rooms ‘of the Cathedral.

The Tap Day committee axed several small ‘grg'aniza'tio11s
from thcprogram, moved it from Soldiers and Sailors, and
ran it off etfectivelv in an hour. Absent after both ceremonies
were complaints of “too long,” “boring,” “dull.”

Curtailed lengths certainly helped these programs. An-
other factor paid‘ oil’, too, Both exercises were heldon the
Cathedral. block‘, andieven being only a catty-cornered‘inter-
_section closer to home brought a few more spectators. .

As far as attendance goes, _the Miorewood-Shjadyside Civic
Association actually did Spring Carnival a favor last Septem-
ber,. when they sought an iniunction to stop’ use" of Ellsworth
Center field for after-dark University activities. ,

Outcome of the Association ’s court action was a judicial
intcrpre.tation, based on an old city ordinance, "banning night
activities in that area. The ’48 Carnival held at Ellsworth was
one of. the residents’ sore spots. ' , I '

Kicked, out of Ellsworth, this year ’s Carnival "committee
sought a new home and wound up on the Cathedral lawn. It
is believed permission was given by school administrators
mainly because of the "'u,ture, building plans, which -will up-'
root the grass anyway. So, for three nights this week, they al-
lowed students to start the lacerations of the lawn with their
shoes- V ' 5 = ‘ ‘

In aiiycase, the switch became an atvtendance ten—strike;
3600 people are reported to have visited the grounds each of
the first two nights. ' A i '4 ’

The ways th‘.-ough which these three programs became
more, successful this year are something for future planners
to ﬁle for reference.' - ‘

Pope Celebrates
Two Years Here
With Hif Show

by DICK KOVAR

In just two short years, Mr.
Harvey Pope has pulled off a
small revolution in and around
Foster Memorial Hall. The ﬁnal
stroke of that revolution is the
current Pitt Players production of
“Dark of the Moon” which goes
into its second night this evening
at 8:30.

Pope’s revolution, while not too
apparent as it was going on, was
a process of takinga bunch of dra-
matically—inclined college kids
and’ ex-GI’s, using a traditional
University organization as _a base,
stuffing these people full of ideas
about modern and experimental
theater, tempering it with a broad
survey on- all, the basic theater
arts, channeling,their enthusiasm
in the right direction, then letting
them go. These tactics have pro-
duced some big bangs on campus,
as well as a, few back—-ﬁres, but
the result was that Pitt has be-
come one of the centers of Pitts-
burgh amateur drama,‘and Har-
vey Pope ﬁnds himself in the‘
amusing position of a sort of ex-
tra-curricular head of an extra-
curricular Drama Department.

Mr. Pope’s work, and the devo-
tion or perseverance of his stu-
dent followers,- shows up iwellin
the Kentucky ‘Mountain legend
play, “Dark of the Moon.” In this
production, Players have combin-
ed their ﬁnest talentstin acting,
directing. staging, lighting, sound,’
and all the other‘ theater techni-
ques, to produce their best all-
around show in some time.

Based on one of the many Bar-
bara Allen legends, the play -fol-
lows the legendary. pattern in
which a boy fallshhopelessly in
love with’Barbara, she is untrue
to him, he_ dies, and she follows
him in death. As laid out by auth-
ors Howard Richardson and Wil-

whataltered, however. _
Barbara’s lover, John, is . a
witch—boy, who longs 1 to _,become
human after making love to',Bar-
‘bara on the mountainside.’ His
wish is granted, providing __Bar--
bara marries him and remains
true to him _for a year. In --spite’ of
many obstacles, John and: Bar-
bara are married, living ‘happily.
together. for almost a year. On
the last day of John’s trial year,
however, Barbara is seduced at" a.
revival _meeting, and John turns
back to ‘a witch at rnoonrise, Bar-
bara- dying at the same time." '
Paired in the leads are .Glori'a
Brodie and‘ Mel Silver. Miss Bro-

gives a highly‘ sentitive portrayal
of Barbara, displaying unusual
restraint in a part that is easily
overplayed. Mel Silver, as John,
gives one of his best performances
in an equally difficult, role. [Both
stars turn in an outstandingpiece
of work.

The supporting cast includes
many veteran Players, with How-
ard Karp as the Conjur Man, Dor-
is Kolasheski and Beti Bucci as
the tempting _ witches, Cecilia
Boodrr’i'an"'ah the Conjur Woman,
John Ingrim as ,Mr., Smelicue,
Murray Harris as the storekeep—
er, and Robert Dickey as Preach-
er Haggler. Although most of these

people have had starring roles in -

previous Pitt productions, there is
no attempt at show-stealing. Ev-
ery supporting player does his job
exactly as it should be done. ‘

As far as the acting goes, ev-
ery. member of the cast shows fine
control. Most of the scenes in the
play call’ for quick, ‘expert hand-
ling of lines and actions by all the
people on stage. The Players-do
not disappoint in this respect. The
1iVe1.Y repartee that snaps back
and forth the stage during the
crowd scenes makes the difference
between just another play with a
couple of good stars, and the su-
perior kind of production that
Players have here.

With every Pitt Player turn-
ing‘ in his best work, “Dark of the

gest success, dramatically, at least.
since Harvey Pope’s arrival two
years ago. And with two more
nights to go, Pittites still have a
chance to ﬁll in the balcony seats

This observer is going both nights.

Wit]: [arnegie Hall Concert

The Glee Club ﬁnishes a successful year with its annual Home
Concert, next Friday evening, at Carnegie Hall.

This is the ﬁrst time in approximately ten years that the Con-

The Club, under the direction of David G. Weiss, will present

Mayor Crowns
Panther Queen

Mayor David L. Lawrence, ﬁrst
Pittsburgh chief executive to at-
tend one of Pitt’s Spring Festival’s,
will crown the queen of the Festi-
val at Pittsburgh’c Progress Prom,
tonight.

When asked what he thought of
the idea, Mayor Lawrence said:
“Pitt Spring Festival is wonder-
full” Acting as a judge at the
Float Parade last Monday, sev-
eral days after accepting the invi-
tation to the prom, Mayor Lawr-
ence, declared “This is the ‘most
wonderful Festival I have seen in
anumber of years.” i
V Festival activities which will be
concluded tomorrow night with
the last staging of “Dark of the
Mocn,” at Foster Memorial, have
had the support of the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce which has
celebrated “Welcome Pittsburgh
Week,” concurrently with Spring
Festival Week. President Joseph
W. Oliver, of the Chamber of
Commerce, has given his support
to the success of the Festival,
_here. . ,

' Said Mr. Oliver: “I, and the
Chamber as “a whole appreciate
the tie-in that the’ University has

. made with the Chamber of Com-

merce week, and we know that ‘the

cooperative scheme and joint
theme, “Pittsburgh, Then and
Now,” has been beneﬁcial to both
groups.”

From oiT—campus former coach
Wesley Fesler, now head football
coach at Ohio! State University,’
wired his fraternity brother Ted
0,kon, chairman of Carnival:
“Wish I could be with you for the
Spring Festival, Sincere best
wishes'for great success, Regards.”

And from Hollywood came word
from one of Pitt’s" most famous
alumni and former’ active fra-
ternity man in Phi Kappa, Gene
Kelly: “Good luckand success to
the Alma Mater’s Spring Festival,
Best regards to everyone, Gene.”

The 1949 Festival will officially
be closed with this quote from an-
other whose support has “made”
the week a success—Howard Dav-
ies.‘Davies said: “Spring Festival
this year went over the top dueto
the support of students and the
community’-at-large.”

FOR UNRES'|'R|C'I'ED FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH

With a view’ to- stool?-piling basic
knowledge, the Du’ Pont Company
has announced a program of grants-._
in-aid for the college year .1949-50 to
10 universities for unrestr-icted
use in thewﬁeld of fundamental re-

- search in chemistry. ' . »

The grants-in-aid of $10;000 eac

I are to\be used for research that has
no immediate commercial goal. The “

universities themselves are to select
the projects in"Vvhich the grants will
be employed, and results of the re-
search are to be freely available for
publication._ ' _
HOW FUNDS WILL .BE USED
Du Pont’s purpose in offering the

fundamental knowledge science
upon which the future industrial de-
velopment of our country is_ so de-

pendent. It is intended that the funds ‘
be utilized for such expenses as em-~

ploying additional research personnel
or lightening the teaching load _of a
professor who is eminently capable

[of research of a high ‘order. They

may also be expended for the pur-
pose of obtaining supplies, appara-
tus or equipment.

'. GRANTS ARE EXPERIMENTAL \
This program of ‘grants-in-aid is
largely experimental. However, it is
Du Pont’s hope, should the program
work out satisfactorily, to’ continue

grants is to help insure the ﬂow of . each grant for avperiod of ﬁve years.

Again in the, academic year 1949-50,“
the Du Pont Company is awarding
post-graduate and post-doctorate fel-
lowships to universities throughout
the country. i

This is a continuation of thecom-i

pany’s 30-year-old plan to encourage

advanced studies in the ﬁelds of chem- A I I
istry, physics, metallurgy, and engi-

neering. , _ .

It is hoped that the plan will con-_
tinue to help maintain the ﬂow‘ of
technically trained men and women
who will go into teaching and research
work at the universities and into tech-

nical ‘positions in industry. Some of 

What Fellowships Proville
Each post-graduate fellowship’ ,
provides $1,200 for a single_
person or $1,800 for a married

. person, together with an award
of $1,000 to the university to-

them, as in past years,may come’ to
work for Du ‘Pont when they ﬁnish

_''their studies, but there is no obligation
to do so; fellowship holders are free to

enter any ﬁeld of activity they choose.

_ The students and their research
subjects will be selected by authori-
ties of the 47 universities participating.
In this year’s program, 45 of the post-
graduate fellowships are in chemistry,
4 in physics, 15 in chemical engineer-
ing, 5 in mechanical engineering and 2
in metallurgy. There will be 6 post-
doctoral fellowships as an incentive to
those who ’:':.‘.:l prefer to remain in

,When you get down to it, Nick Bolkovac and Len Radnor are

 ﬁrst~string football players because they make proper use of good

 physics. Not the’ medicinal-kind, mind you, but the scientiﬁc.

F
i
L
r
i

This bit of information was divulged this week by Dr. Oswald “

g_i,(aiIBlackwood, a professor of physics here who does not care “two

ffijickels about sports.”

 ‘Professor Blackwood, a big,
31-‘uddy-faced man with a snow-
 head, came by this desk
_,h:e"other day in search of a few
sfpliotographs of football players.

';;amp1e,’* lec-

 the professor. "“Crouched

 to the ground and with his -

flags-:/spread‘wide apart, he illus-
")’iL'fates—the principles of stability.
 -Measures Horsepower

‘_ /..A1nother,Apnoto which struck the
:,’«Professo'r’s fancy was one of Nick
,Tl_3_on{'ovac and Sam DeFede put-
 ‘their shoulders to a heavy
iiblgcking sled.

’*“" ‘Suppose that sled weighs 200

 
   

A

pounds,” supposed the man of sci-
gice. “If they push that thing un-
friction of ’ 50

. pounds, they will have traveled at

a rate of ten horsepowers.”
V Data Essential

Now I consider these data facts
which no sports reporter should
be without. Messrs. Bolkovac and
DeFede, moreover, might try

springing them on the opposing‘

linemen sometime. If they can’t
knock their enemies down with 'a
solid block, maybe they can over-
whelm them with knowledge.

A As a matter of fact, Professor
Blackwood began to overpower
me with knowledge when he
started to say something about
kinetic and potential energy. I just
lacked the energy to solve what
he was saying. So I will let the
matter go with a short plug for

the ’Professor’s book.

It is entitled “High School Phys-
ics” by Blackwood, Kelly, and
Herron, and is guaranteed not to
be spicy.

Oppose lions T otla y, Tamarra w

By LYNN C. MITCHELL

Pitt’s impressive baseball rec-
ord of eight wins and three losses
will be seriously threatened when
Ralph Mitterling’s Mittmen face
Penn State in a two-game series

; today and tomorrow at the Lion’s

home ﬁeld.
Pitt lost its ﬁrst road game on

up by Deryl Calder and Rudy
Hudec. Bob Pastors, Tiger ﬁrst
baseman, collected two‘ of them,
each time with two men aboard.
Whether Pitt or State has play-5
ed the toughest schedule is hard
to say, but the Mittmen are de-

termined to take the Lions in .
_ both games ‘and bring a ten and

three record back to the Cathe-
dral.

To date, the Lions, coached by

Joe Bedenk, have showed plenty
of pitching and offensive power
in winning seven games and only
losing one and tieing another with
lglaivy at Annapolis last Saturday,

Mitterling has named no start-

ing hurler for today’s game but

it is" likely the nod will go- to
Larry Brent and possibly Frank
Papariello or Deryl Calder tomor-
row.

Wayne   Upset A (Id Pressure

For Better Home finder Slate

By BOB LEVIS
Eddie Sudzina and the Panther mile relayers shared honors
Wednesday to pace the home cindermen to a sparkling 70-61 upset

victory over. Wayne University.

From the looks of the 500 odd spectaters who watched the
meet, it seems certain track at Pitt is on the upswing. It is sure

that Coach Carl Olson’s thincladse

will have more home meets next
year, just from Wednesday’s
sprightly showing.

° Opera Interferes

_ The big “if” governing a more
lucrative home schedule is how
long the Civic Opera will con-
tinue to use the Stadium. Time
will tell.

The Wayne meet resembled a
close basketball game as the two
squads battled back and forth all
afternoon.

Before the running of the mile
relay, Pitt was leading 65-61, and
Wayne was favored in this last
event of the day. It would mean
ﬁve points to them and one point
66-65 victory for the Tartars of
Detroit. I '

But it didn’t go that way, and

four of Olson’s top sprinters led,

all the way, for the most crucial
win of the day and the second.
dual meet win of the year.

Len Henry, Jim Banner, Dick
Hohan, and Dick, Firsching can
probably thank hard work during
the late‘ Winter and early spring
for their fast 3:25 effort Wednes-
day. ,

Distance man Sudzina was giv-
en a hard run by marathoner Dick
Brown of Wayne, but managed to
sprint at the end or both the mile
and two mile runs to come up
with a double victory.

Credit must also be given Pan-‘

ther ﬁeld and weight’ men who
knotched 12 of 16 places in those
events. Dave Christopher tossed
the shot 45 feet 1/2 inch, for his
best throw ever. He also took a
second in the discus heave behind
Bob Arthurs.

Tomorrow morning Olson will
move his squad to Athens, Ohio,
for their fourth meet of the sea-
son wifh Ohio University. Pitt
won this one last year 106-25.
