THE NEW (JHEERLEADERS chosen Tuesday are (left to right), ﬁrst
row: Kay Shenesky. Paula Radvak, and Ann Weinberg; second row: .

twenty-two schools at the Debate Association of Pennsyl-

Vania Colleges’ Annual State Tournament held at Pennsyl-_ 

vania State University last weekend. .

Mahmood Mamdani, a sophomore liberal arts majo
from Uganda, East Africa, won ﬁrst place in the State Ora-
tory for his speech “We Shall Overcome-—Someday.”

Mamdani, a participant in the
recent civil rights demonstration
in Montgomery, Alabama, spoke
of his reasons for joining the
march when he exclaimed, “Can
anybody honestly say that what
we went down to ﬁght in Mont-
gomery, Alabama, was merely
an American problem? I for one
willnotagree;itwasandisa
human problem.”

Speaking of the demonstrations
that center in the South, Mam-

dani said: “It’s no use pretend-

ing that discrimination does not
exist in the North. It does. The
only difference is that in the
South discrimination is not only
real but also open. Discrimina-
tion in the South is also legal.
Thus, any ﬁght waged against it
has ‘better chances of achieving
tangible results.

“You can see the barrier being‘
broken and the line crossed over.
The President sends down Fed-
eral Troops to guarantee the
right to demonstrate or the Con-
gress passes a Civil Rights Law.
and you say to yourself, There,
that’s what I fought for!”’

Mamdani described his accom-
plishment in going to Alabama

A as “the delivery of a personal

message to the Negro that some-
body cared. Somebody that wasn't
black cared. And cared enough
to live, talk, eat and sleep with
him for days together and face
the same dangers, frustrations,
and brutality that have been his
for centuries."

One of the things that amazed 
Mamdani most was the selectiv-  

ity of the police brutality. He re-

lated an experience which clear- A "

ly revealed this to him: “When
the attack came I was in the
front of the lines. One of the
posse hit me in the back. I ex-
pected another one; instead I saw
saw him swing the hilly at a

Negro girl right next to me. The 

fact that she was a girl did not
matter. The all-important-point
was that she was a Negro.”

Commenting on his 

from Alabama and his feelings
after experiencing the effects of

the discrimination there, Mam-. _ ‘P

dani said, “Now we are all back.
Montgomery, Alabama, is sunk
into the all-absorbing past. Those
three days were horrifying, over-
whelming, terrifying to all of us.
And yet, we mustnot forget that

what was an exception for us is ‘ ’

a way of life for the Negro.

“I am amazed, I am full-\o‘f—~re-» 1..

of the utter misery, the despair-

ing frustration and subhuman __. in

existence, he is still non-violent. F’ ii

tics, Judith Welles, Volunteers in

representative, began her plea for ‘ *

volunteers, at Wednesday’s Mid- 0
day address in the Student Union
Supper Room. A

“squalor and decay” which are [7

found “just oﬂ the superhigh- 

ways, in the hollows of West Vir-,5

   Little Visits with God  

 
 

Everyone ‘knows that reli-

. ’ gion is having a hard time of
e , it. There was no need for

Allan Hart J a.-hsmann and
Martin Simon to kick it
While it’s down. Yet they
must be praised for their ﬁ-
ness; their book, Little Visits
God (Concordia Publishing House,
$3.00, 286 pp.), is a superb reduc-

'tion ad absurdum of the Sunday
school morality.

In one of the 200 little moral
dramas collected in this volume,
for instance, little Jimmy learns
that Jesus proclaimed, “I am the
way.” “Oh,” Jimmy concludes,

‘ﬂ “Jesus is like an elevator. He
‘ takes people up to heaven.” And
. the authors concur: “Jimmy had
 a ‘pretty good idea.”

Another “visit” records that

-‘Jimmy's wagon was scratched.

He waited for days for it to get

 4 better, but the scratch remained.

_ ..When Jimmy scratched his hand,

however, it healed all by .itself
within just a couple days. Why?
“A man made the wagon. Jesus
made the hand.”

Telling the truth can some-

. times be wrong, is warned in an-

in 7 other “visit.” It points out that

we needn’t always tell all the

7 nasty things we know about

someone, except, “of course, some-

 . times we are expected to tell our

 HOUSE‘of i

 
   

   
 
 
   
  
 

‘parents or teachers the bad

things someone else is doing . . .”
Other visits explain to children

’ ; “How to Keep from Sinning” and
‘ , “How to Get Clean on the In-

side’.’; one even questions, “Is
Your Mouth Clean?”
Such topics surely Seem mm‘

cuous -— until the child realizes
what .a burlesque is being made
of the basic precepts we have so
painfully taught him. There are
enough moral anarchists running
around undermining the Ameri-
can way of life without taking
a chance on augmenting the prob-
lem merely for the sake of hum-
or.

Satire when employed for its
humor can be delightful; how-
ever, when directed at the moral
base of our society, it can be de-
structive. Little Visits with God
is certainly not a book for the
young; it could easily bring about
psychological disturbances in im-
pressionable little minds. It could
even upset their whole moral
point of view.

The discretion of university
book stores which stock this Vol-
ume must be questioned. Aliena-
tion among the disturbed and
bearded immature is rampant
enough, without disseminating
more uneasiness.

Were our college students to
quit playing pinochle at the Tuck
Shop and instead spend their few
moments between classes with
Little Visits with God, our en-
tire subcultural standard could
be destroyed. Besides, this time
could be employed much more
proﬁtably in humble prayer.

With murder and disobedience
rampant in the streets, the world
today witnesses the greatest
struggle against evil of all time.
Of course, we must be careful
about Hunting freedom of ex-
pression. Yet, we must also be
careful to protect our young.

  VISTA Head Depietsiiiii  

Squalor and Poverty

(Continued from Page 1)

Vista, Miss Welles continued, “gives a hand and not a
hand out. Its direct contact with th'e poor is the key to suc-
cess of doing somethingon a national scale about poverty.”

VISTA volunteers live in the community in which they
a1'e working for one year. They are given enough money to
live in the community on the same standard as those around
them. They also receive medical care and $50 dollars a
month which they receive at the end of their service.

Volunteers work with migrant
workers, tenement dwellers, and
school dropouts from the ﬁrst
grade and upward. Their main
task is to “bridge the gap be-
between the poor, isolated for so
long, and middle class Ameri-
cans.

Miss Welles related that at pre-
sent a volunteer is living in New
Haven, Connecticut, tenement,
soon to be replaced by better

housing. The volunteer is train- I

ing the residents in housekeep-

ing hygiene to prevent the new I

housing from becoming a slum.

“VISTA needs people with
know-how even if it is how to
budget welfare checks, ﬁll out
applications, or read the want
ads,” she added.

“Poverty,” Miss Welles -explain- p

ed, “is not new. It passes from
generation to generation but is
worst in the children who know
they will grow up in the same

shack as their parents before’

them.”

VISTA, she emphasized, will
not wipe out poverty but “it can
begin to break the cycle of pov-
erty, and give the next genera-
tion the opportunity to learn,
work, and live in decency and

dignity-”

B111:-.y, Bodle
Win Sports’
Top Awards

Football players Pete Bil-
ley and Bill Bodle won the
Athletic Committee and
Hartwig Awards, reSPe0-
tively, at the All Sports Ban-
quet Tuesday night. The
awards are the two most coveted
honors given for athletics here.

Billey has a 3.21 quality point
average and was a kicking spe-
cialist on the football team for
three years. On these merits the

- athletic committee named him

“the senior athlete who has main-
tained the best -combination of
high scholarship, all around ath-
letic ability, sportsmanship, an
aptitude.” ’

Billey came here as a halfback
from United, Pa. He. lettered in
his sophomore year, but a severe
hand injury sidelined him during
his junior season. He completed
his football career as a starter
this season and enters Dental
School in the fall.

The Charles C. Hartwig award
goes annually to the student “who
through his efforts has done the
most to promote athletics at the
University.” Bodle won the award
‘despite a serious leg injury this

» season.

He lettered two years in foot-
ball and one year in wrestling.
Frustration typiﬁed Bodle’s ath-
letic career, especially this year.

‘ After averaging nearly four yards

per carry as a junior, he injured
his leg during fall football prac-
tice and saw ..¢+1e action this
year.

Wrestling was a similar di-
lemma. Having no ‘ previous ex-
perience, Bodle joined the team

‘as a junior and wrestled. two

years without glory. He "won
only once and was often over-
come by experienced heavy-
weights. Despite his losses, Bo-
dle remained on the team, ﬁlling
a depleted upper weight division.

During the past two years, he
has seen’ limited action as a
catcher, occasionally replacing
starter Doug Chambers. Bodle,
however, still has_baseball eligi-
bility and is trying for an out-
ﬁeld position.

Although he graduates this
year as a mathematics major in

education, Bodle remains unde- .

cided about his future. ‘He has
professional football oﬂers from
the Pittsburgh Steelers and Wash-
ington Redskins. -

Among the most valuable play-
er awardees were Roland James
— gynmastics, Lee! Hall — wres-

-tling, and Andy .Iames-—swim-

ming. Wrestling coach Rex Peery
was made an honorary member
of the Varsity Lettermap’s Club.

they gain awareness. Only too often stu-

Very few of them have seen it face to face.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ayers Lauded

Editor, The Pitt News:

A note of congratulation to the
Pitt Players and the University
Theater for their remarkable
Woyzeck. William Kingsley’s per-
formance as the hero could hard-
ly have been better, it seems to
me; and the supporting cast was
unusually strong. The whole pro-
duction was excitingly designed

in, page and “build” to achieve a ’

powerful and moving ﬁnale. In
sum, it was, as ﬁne a piece of
University theater as I have seen.
Many thanks.

Dylan Review

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is evident to me (and every-
one else I’ve talked to) that Mar-
vin Zelkowitz didn't really know
what he was talking about when
he reviewed the Dylan-Baez show.
The people who went to the Syria.
Mosque Wednesday and Thurs-
day nights went to hear Folk
music; if they had gone to see
“the Kingston Trio or Peter, Paul
and Mary” they would have gone
for a diﬁerent reason.

One of Amt-rica’sFI‘Grea1

A huge part of Bob 153'1an’s
talent lies in [how he interprets
his songs. If Marv has ever heard
“the Kingston- Trio or Peter,
Paul and Mary"
songs, he knows what a complete
hash they can make of them. Bob
Dylan puts so much of himself
in his songs that three-quarters
of his art is his presentation. ‘

No one is asking Marv to like
folk songs. We’re just asking him
to recognize art and talent when

he's within a hundred feet of it _

for two hours. —
