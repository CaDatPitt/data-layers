Pitt faces
14.5 Inillion
shortfall

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

Pitt will be facing a $ 14.5 million shortfall
in fiscal year 1992, according to a report
released by University President Wesley
Posvar yesterday.

“Make no mistake about it; we are
talking about cutting budgets. We are
talking about taking money out of existing
budgets in order to make up for that
shortfall. There is going to be pain all over
the place. So do you cut off your right
thumb or your left little finger or your big
toe or your right arm? I mean, those are the
options,” Provost Donald Henderson told
a meeting of the University Senate Council
yesterday.

Posvar’s report is part of an early analysis
by the administration of next year’s budget
situation. The administration has calculated
the shortfall by estimating next year’s
revenues and expenditures. Part of that
estimation includes what Posvar calls top
priorities: a 7.5-percent increase ($16.6
million) in the pool for faculty and staff
salaries and a $750,000 increase for library
acquisitions.

“This is a deliberate attempt or
commitment to move up a solid notch the
compensation level of the university. And
the reason for this is rational and clear, and
that is, if we are going to beaustere and try
to be more productive and more efficient
in our allocation of resources, then
compensation is the quintessential

Posvar said that the salary increases will
be part of “a fixed or prime assumption in
budget.” Last year, the salary pool was
increased by 4 percent, an amount that
many faculty criticized and considered to
be too low.

In 1976,Jacqueline Fleming was working
on research for her book, Blades in Colleges,
when she discovered that she had to draw
some unhappy conclusions.

“[Blackl students who attended white
colleges showed profiles that looked as
though their intellectual development was
more likely to be thwarted than
encouraged,” she said. “It doesn’t matter

look at, the same estimates of the difference

Fleming,
psychology at Barnard College, lectured
on “Blacks in Colleges: Strategies for
Success” last night in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room as part of Black
Week.

Fleming said that when she reports her
findings, people tend to use them as an
argument for a return to segregation."

“They say, ‘well, if black students seem
to be doing better, or showing more
growth in black schools, then maybe all
black students just ought to go to black
schools,’ But I tend not to think of it that
way,” she said.

“What research does is it gives you
feedback on a situation and if you don’t
like the feedback you’re getting, you have
the full power to change things for the.
future,” she said.

Fleming cited four developmental
pressures that hinder the progress of black
students in both predominantly black and
predominantly white colleges.

The University of Pittsburgh’s main campus has
undergone an estimated enrollment decrease of less than
1 percent, according to the director of the Ofﬁce of
Management and Policy Analysis.

The office places Pitt’s current population at 22,464 full—
time students.

Although the university exceeded its expectations of
enrollment for the fall semester, it experienced a reduction
of .8 percent compared to the fall of 1989.

“The university’s enrollment is probably close to what
it was this past year,” said Betsy Porter, Ph.D., director of
Pitt’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid.

Porter attributes the drop to the slight decline in
enrollment in the schools of engineering and dental
medicine, as well as the changing format in the
undergraduate ‘programs of both the schools of education
and physical therapy.

“[Recruitment into] the School of Engineering has
always been and continues to be trend—related to the job
market,” said Porter. “In the past four or five years it’s

been much more difficult to recruit students in the ﬁeld
of engineering of the quality that [Pitt] requires. [The
administrators] have been willing to have slightly fewer
students and maintain the quality of the class.”

As for the School of Education, Porter explained that an
undergraduate degree in education is no longer available.
Students must now earn a degree in a specific area and
spend an additional year in the graduate department of
the School of Education to get their teaching certificates.

“Over the course of a period of time, we have phased
out the undergraduate school of education with the
exception of the fifth-year certificate program,” said
Porter.

In addition, she said, “Both the Professional Association
of Physical Therapists and the faculty proposed that the
undergraduate degree be phased out and it be replaced
by a master’s-level program.”

Countering the decrease in enrollment to these schools,
the College of Arts and Sciences enrolled over 400 more
students than was originally anticipated by the fiscal
budget. ’

Coping on Campus...

‘More—than—rnild’ depression requires professional help

If you are bothered with feelings
of sadness, hopelessness or
emptiness, and you just don't

seem to care about things
anymore, you may be
experiencing a form of

depression. Most people will
occasionally feel mildly
depressed, or “down,” and this
feeling appears to be especially
common among college students.
Feelings of depression often
follow a loss such as a broken
relationship or the death of a
loved one, or they may be related
to specific disappointments of
some sort or to problems with
friends or family. Fortunately,
most people get over this
depression in a few weeks and
resume their former ways of
feeling, thinking and behaving.

There are many ways to move
this healing process along, such

friends, for instance, increasing
your exercise output or becoming
involved with some other
meaningful activity. Sometimes,
however, it becomes necessary
to seek professional help for
more—than-mild depression. A
cluster of persisting symptoms
that may include sleep
disturbance, fatigue, irritability,
extreme pessimism, loss of
appetite and suicidal thoughts
can be a sign of a more serious
depressive disorder. People who
are in this state of depression are
advised not to try and “tough it
out” by themselves or to assume
that the feelings will pass. When
these kinds of depressive
symptoms seem to alternate with
periods of exceptionally elevated,
expansive or irritable moods, it

may suggest a manic—depressive
disorder. This also requires
professional assistance.

The vast majority of people
with depression can be helped
with medication and/or psycho-
therapy.The following resources
are available. _

For assessment or short- term
therapy call the University
Counseling and Student
Development Center at 648-7930.

Former Pittsburgh coroner disputes ]FK's autopsy findings

‘ii By Renee Crespy

Stajf Writer

Addressing Ted Windt’s
Presidential Rhetoric class, former

Pittsburgh City Coroner Cyril‘

Wecht said Friday that portions

 of the report by the commission
that studied the assassination of

the former President John F.
Kennedy were incorrect.
Wecht, who is one of America’s
leading forensic pathologists, said
that in three weeks it will be the
27th anniversary of the
assassination of Kennedy, but 90
to 95 percent of the people in the
that Wecht was

speaking to had not even born
yet. However, he said it’s
important, though for people who
were not alive then or were too
young to remember to know the
factual inaccuracies of the Warren
Commission Report.

“The history books have a
meager amount of information
about the assassination, and it is
of course set forth in the form of
the Warren Commission Report,"
said Wecht.

"Therefore, it stands to reason
that no matter how smart you are
or how intelligent you are — if
you have not heard people talk
about this, you have not listened

to radio, television and talk shows
or have not read any of the books
written by the critics of the Warren
report, or if you have not on your
own looked up some of the
articles about this subject, then
you have no way ofknowing that
the assassination is not as clear as
the Warren Commission report
made itout to be,” said Wecht.

Subsequent investigations led
to the discovery that the Warren
Commission report was incorrect
and there were a number of
differences between the Warren
report and additional
investigations.

cope with the declining numbers

In 1979 Allegheny County

Porter.

In 1978 [h€OfﬂC€ of Admissions

Porter. “We’re working very hard

of that process.”

Budget

Continued from page 1
Chesler thanked the administration for the
commitment, but asked that the criteria for
determining merit when giving out
individual raises be altered. 4

“I hope that this year in those instructions
with the 7.5 percent to be allocated, there
will be something very specific that says it
is time to provide appropriate
compensation for teaching at a level that

is equivalent to the kind of merit increment
that is given for research,” Chesler said.

Posvar said that Pitt’s promise to faculty
is not typical of other universities.

“If you look at the ﬁgures, the
compensation is about the same as the
remainder to be cut or re—allocated. It
would have been possible in a passive
budget situation to have done nothing and
to have a status—quo institution, basically

with no salary increases and no cuts. In
some political systems in some states, that
can and does happen.,” Posvar said.
Henderson said that deans, department
Chairpersons and faculty will work together
to find places to cut the $14.5 million from
the budget. He added that departments
that are growing and doing well will
probably bear less of the burden than
departments that are losing students.

“What very well may be required is fog...
us to make a decision that responsibility
center X and Y have got to go. I mean we
simply cannot afford to support it anymore.
And that has got to be a collective decision,”
Henderson said.

Posvar said that part of the shortfall will
be made up by not replacing some faculty
and staff positions when people leave Illffi
university.

Blood

Continued from page 1
are students, faculty, staff,
graduate students and evening
students. Fraternities and
sororities help out a lot; they
usually have about 1,000 donors,”
said Edmunds.

“We have 25 different blood
drives on campus from [Nov. 5-
23], ” said Edmunds. “These drives
cover everybody on campusfrom
the professional schools to the
student union.”

Yesterday kicked off this year’s
Greek Week portion of the blood
drive. According to Rosenthal,
the initial response has been even
more enthusiastic than last year’s,
with atleast 200 donors by the
end of the first day. He said
reason for such a turnout is
obvious.

“Giving blood has nothing to
do with giving money. It saves
lives. You save three lives with
each pint of blood,” he said.

Anita Rodriguez, a member of
Tri—Sigma sorority had her own
reasons for choosing to donate
blood — one of her sorority

sisters had lupus, and she needed
48 units of blood transfusions to
survive.

“She would not be alive right
now if it wasn’t for people who
gave blood,” said Rodriguez.

Other donors cited personal
reasons for donating blood. Carol
Mayersaid, “It hurt a little, but
you save lives this way.”

Marc Muroff agreed. “It was
too important not to do,” he said.
Kathy Miller, a member of Kappa
Delta sorority, said her reasons
for donating were simple. “It

‘ makes me feel good about
myself,” she said.

During halftime of the Pitt-Penn
State game the winner will be
announced. “Last year we lost by
24 votes, but [Penn,State] had
20,000 more students than Pitt, so
I think Pitt did a nice job,” said
Edmunds.

Rosenthal is confident that this
year Pitt Greeks will match the
Penn State challenge. “I definitely
think we will meet our goal,” he
said.

Central Blood Bank services 32

hospitals throughout Allegheny
and Washington counties and
Weirton, W.Va., with donors’
blood from the drive. “Each of
the hospitals needs 600 units of
blood every day, and we hope
this drive will help,” said Edmund.

According to Rosenthal, Greek
Week is second only to
Westinghouse as thelargest group
donor in Pittsburgh in providing
blood donations to Central Blood
Bank.

Central Blood Bank also has 12
fixed sights around Pittsburgh
where the general public can
donate blood.

Many people are nervous and
have questions before donating
blood, said a Central Blood Bank
representative. Some of these
questions include “How long
before the blood that I donate is
replaced?” or “How often can I
donate?” According to Central
Blood Bank,'a donor's volume
will adjust within a few hours; the
red blood cells will be replaced
within a few weeks, and a person
can donate as often as every 56

days. According to Central Blood
Bank, there are many facts that
the general public isn’t aware of:

-One blood donation, once
separated into components, can
help save the lives of three or
more patients.

oIn this area, 85 percent of all
people between the ages of 17
and 70 are medically eligible to
donate blood. Only 9 percent
actually do.

oln the United States, people

age 65 and older use
approximately 43 percent of the
blood supply.

-Eighty-nine percent of all
open—heart surgeries require as
many as six blood products for
each procedure.

-Type O—positive blood is the
most common and most needed.

-The rarest blood is the type
that is not available when it is
needed.

After a person has donated
blood, it’s tested to detect blood
type and the presence of any
antibodies. In addition every unit
of blood is tested to prevent the

spread of hepatitis, syphilis, HIV
and HTLV-I (a rare virus
associated with a form of
leukemia). Units that test positive
for any of these are discarded,

and donors with positive tesf

results are discreetly notified.
One of the most frequently
asked questions is “Can I get
AIDS from donating blood?”
According to Central Blood Bank,
a person cannot get AIDS or any
disease by donating blood. “All
equipment used is sterile,
prepackaged and disposable.

Each drawing kit is used on one *

donor and then discarded.”

Rosenthal felt that the fear of
contracting the HIV virus as well
as being frightened of the needle
were reasons why people may
feel wary of giving blood, but he
stressed that these fears were
unfounded.

“You can’t get AIDS from giving

blood because everything is‘

sterile. So come on down and
give some blood; it’s quick, it
doesn’t hurt and there’s food,” he
said.

After electing Meghan Malloy and
Christine Helsel co—presidents, the
Campus Women's Organization took over
an empty cubicle in the William Pitt
Union last Thursday.

“We need a cubicle desperately, and
they won’t give us one,” said Anita Dash,
CWO business manager.

She said that although there are cubicles
that are not being used in the William Pitt

Union, the CWO’s request for one has I

been rejected due to a technical error in
the application.

In protest, the members found an
empty cubicle and affixed “Students for
Choice” stickers and left a copy of a ﬂyer
stating their deﬁnition of a feminist on it.

“It’s not their fault that there’s an error,
but it’s not a significant problem. They’re
just using that small error as an excuse to
not give us the cubicle,” said Dash.

Dash noted that the CWO is increasing
in size, and not having office space has
become a serious problem. “We usually
get 40 people at a meeting. If people

want to leave us messages, they can’t,”
she said.

Another problem is the issue of student
representation, according to Dash.

“No pro—choice group is represented
here [in the union]. Women are 50 percent
of this campus, and there is no women's
group being represented up here,” Dash
said.

Malloy and Helsel will split the co-
presidential position previously held by
Jennifer Baldwin, who will be graduating

this year. Stephanie Helsel will retain her ,

current position as co—president, and

Dash will continue to hold the position
of business manager.

The position of co-president involves
the organization of educational and social
events as well as meetings. CWO
members also assist in the group’s
organizational activities.

In an upcoming social activity, the
CWO will sponsor the pro—choice movie
entitled “With a Vengeance.” Following
the movie, National Abortion Rights

will speak. This event will be held on

produces a signiﬁcant freshman-
senior difference from which we
infer change or lack thereof,” she
said.

According to Fleming, three of
the four developmental pressures
are experienced by both black
and white college students. “It’s
only the fourth one that seems to
be more race—related,” she said.

“The first developmental
pressure is the pressure to become
more involved in campus life,”
she said. “On predominantly
black college campuses, it
appears that involvement in
campus life seems to build an
attachment to college.”

But according to Fleming, on
predominantly white college
campuses, black students who
become involved in campus life
report a negative attachment to
college, more negative feelings
about their fellow students and a
worse social adjustment than stu-
dents who attend black colleges.

this aspect of the college
experience ought to offer as many
incentives for participation in
leadership opportunities as
possible,” without forcing black
and white students to compete
for these positions, she said.

“To the extent that we make it
competitive, I think we run the
risk of increasing racial tensions,”
she said.

“I have noticed in my travels
that black student leaders tend to
be the usual recipients of racial
violence. There were
widespread rumors on at least
one college campus that several
black student leaders had been
murdered for their activities, and
the students who believed these
rumors were reluctant to
participate in. a leadership

capacity,” she said.

“Itseems to me that there should
be enough opportunities for lead-
ership to go around,” she said.

The second developmental
pressure is the pressure toward
competence, which initially
causes some students to lose
interest in earning good grades,
she said.

“It may be . . that because

Fleming recommended that
black students strive to gain
competence in at least one major
area and that colleges offer more
awards and internships specific-

these relationships, she said. ,

“The minute a student walks on
campus, that student should make
finding a mentor an item of the
highest priority,” she said.

The fourth developmental
pressure is the pressure to
experience threatening situations,
which occurs on both white and
black college campuses, she said.

“On white college campuses,
the response to threatening sit-
uati_ons may be enhanced black
ideology and assertiveness,” she
said.

Since a black student has a 50/

Faculty deserves pay bi/ee

Last month, Congress struggled to compromise on a
suitable budget for this country. After weeks of heated
debate, it finally agreed to cut separate programs in each
sector of the economy. Now, the University of Pittsburgh
has to come to a similar compromise with its budget.

*2 Five years ago Pitt President Wesley Posvar claimed that

within five years, members of the Pitt faculty would be
paid on an even-par status with other faculties in the
American Association of Universities. Recently, the average
salary for Pitt faculty members was rated 50th out of 57
schools in the AAU.

At yesterday’s senate council meeting, however, Posvar
sai/cl_that‘the university, during the 1992 fiscal year, will be
$14. 5 million in debt. Provost l5onald Henderson said that
the university “... is talking about taking money out of
existing budgets in order to make up for that shortfall.”
One of the top priorities for this year, then, would be to
increase this stature. J

Last year, the university gave its faculty a 4—percent
salary increase, which was heavily criticized as being
insufficient to compensate for cost-of-living increases. For

f the 1992 budget, the faculty will receive a 7.5-percent
raise. A

i” Unfortunately, because of the deficit Pitt is facing, cuts

will have to be made in other departments to make up for
this raise. This will mean that the faculty members will
have to decide where they can slash their respective
departments.

This salary raise was needed to protect the faculty from
becoming upset about insufficient pay. It was also needed
so that the university will be able to attract high-quality
professors with its salary offers. ’

Many companies give their employees cost-of-living
raises so that they can survive financially as everyday
prices increase.'Rightfully, then, the university is giving
the faculty members this much—needed raise that they
have been promised for so long.

The University of Pittsburgh has given its faculty this
raise that they deserve. Now these people must decide

it where their respective departments can be cut to hurt the

university the least. They would be the most suited to
make decisions as to where these cuts should be made.
Therefore, they also will have to take the heat should they
make bad judgments.

Henderson said, “So, do you cut off your right thumb or
your left little finger or your big toe or your right arm?” The
faculty will have to make those decisions for themselves

'7'“ in their own departments. Hopefully, they will only cut

less important parts and save their heads.

Christians don't condone sacriﬁce

I found it difficult to make sense of [Jessica]
Coville’s article, “Sacrificial Practices Were Good”
(Oct. 31 issue). Aside from her unfounded reasons
for attacking the Judeo-Christian faiths, Ms. Coville’s
designs remain cryptically embedded within the
incongruous, misinformed text of the article.

goodness when performed in the

pains to expose the nature of Satanism and its lack
of sacriﬁcial ritual, Ms. Coville ignorantly draws
attention to sacrificial aspects of Christianity, such
as the “putrefied image” of Jesus on the cross.

So, is Ms. Coville saying that sacrificial symbolism
found in the Judeo-Christian traditions is
characteristically putrescent, while ritualistiC/
symbolic sacrifice in pagan religious traditions is
noble and thus justified? _

Beliefs in birth, death and renewal are not
concepts quintessential to pagan religions singularly
but are rather the symbolic equivalent to the birth,
death and resurrection of Jesus.[...l_

Additionally, how can Ms. Coville conclude that
current homicides associated with ritualistic items
and symbols are perpetrated by “misguided people,”
consciously venting and not religiously motivated
criminals? Ms. Coville, were the pagans misguided
to believe that sacrifice could bring fertility, to the
soil? Perhaps not — flesh is a good fertilizer! [...l

Bus lane convenient for most
I am tired of hearing people gripe about the Fifth
Avenue bus lane. It may be an inconvenience, but
it is not a problem.
There are at least 10 different bus routes that run
through Oakland. This creates a problem when
they are all on Forbes [Avenue] because of all the

‘businesses there. Fifth Avenue is much less busy.
Last year when the bus lane was closed, traffic was A

If people would take the time to think before
they step into the street and use a little caution, they
wouldn’t get hit.[...l

Pedestrians have responsibility on the road just
like drivers. You don’t just stroll across the street at
any place. In an article in the Oct. 30 issue of The
Pitt News, someone said that you can get “trapped
by the railings.” It is dangerous to cross the street
in these areas; that is why the railings were put
there.

Crossing the street takes just a little patience and
caution, not complaints. If anyone needs any more
advice about the rules of crossing the street ask any
7-year-old. I’m sure they would be happy to tell

opinion, lazy and self—centered.

Greeks often do no better in their volunteer
“service” as well. The director of volunteer services
at a large medical institution in Oakland was
relieved to find out that I, a new volunteer, was not
a sorority member. Working with members of the
Panhellenic system was difficult, she said, because
they lacked true dedication to the volunteer work.

I have seen a number of students exert tremendous
effort to get accepted into the Panhellenic system.
If the “cause” is that important to them, it would be
nice to see them exert some effort to provide a
service or productfor their fund‘-raising dollars and
to genuinely contribute to their volunteer projects.

Pitt Taxi service inefficient

This is written with extreme disappointment in
regards to what they call the Pitt Taxi.

On Saturday night I called in, gave the address on
Ward Street and was told [the taxi] would arrive
within 10 minutes. Thirty—five minutes later I called
back and was informed, a little late, that the taxi did
not serve past the Boulevard of the Allies. ‘

1)LastI knew, it’s_still Oakland past the Boulevard,
and considering it's the most dangerous part of
Oakland and the number of students living there,
that’s unreasonable.

2)What difference does an extra eighth of a mile
make? I believe a girl was recently raped on Ward
Street.

?))Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of a “safety
shuttle?”l...l .

I think that the Pitt Taxi is a very good idea, but
quite a few adjustments need to be made before it
will be effective. My safety was only endangered by
trying to use it, and I won’t try again unless I hear
of any improvements.

Women swimmers win three meets over eekend

By Chris Kuzneski
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt women’s swiming team
continued its winning ways this weekend
with three easy victories, increasing its
record to 4-0.

On Friday Pitt easily defeated St.
Bonaventure (0-1) by a score of 153-87
with a total team effort.

“Everyone had a nice meet," said Pitt
team captain Theresa Picklo, “I could
easily go down the team roster and say
something good about everyone on the
squad."

Pitt Coach David Belowich agreed. “The
team swam well together, and they were
really focused. ,

"We also swept the boards [diving]. It
was a good meet for us, and it gave us
momentum for Saturday’s meet.“

And Pitt took advantage of that
momentum in a Big East dual meet at
Syracuse on Saturday.

The Lady Panthers shot out to an early
advantage against their weaker opponent,
St. John’s, and coasted to an easy 75-29
victory. , '

“It’s just not my style to rub it in,” said
Belowich. “So after seizing a big early
lead, we had exhibition swimming [where
point totals do not count] with St. John’s.
They are really not too strong a squad, but
they will get better.”

Belowich mentioned Picklo, Candie

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

The Women's swimming team defeated St. Bonaventure, St. John's and Syracuse last weekend, improving their record to 4-0.

Burke, Laura-Lee Sullivan and two divers,
Donna Flatch and Krissa Ratliff, as big
contributors.

“I was really impressed with Theresa
lPicklo], though, both in and out of the
pool. She makes a great contribution
swimming, but her leadership is just as
valuable,” said Belowich.

Against Syracuse, the Lady Panther squad
was challenged, but it still coasted to a 69-
44 win.

Pitt clinched the meet when Burke and
Sullivan ﬁnished first and second in the
200—yard breaststroke — with times of 2
minutes, 30 seconds and 2:30.04.

“The team is really coming together,”

said Belowich. “The early-season
conditioning is coming through, and we
are swimming really well.”

Volleyball squad
sweeps Seton Hall

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ" Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team continued to dominate the
Big East, with a surprisingly easy three-game win by scores of
15-2, 15-5 and 15-6 over Seton Hall (24-9) in the team’s final
home match of the season Saturday afternoon. The Lady
Panthers raised their Big East record to a perfect 7-0 and their
overall record to 2541.

Senior co-captain Michele Adamson said after the match, “We
‘were told these guys were close to Georgetown, but they really
aren’t.” The Georgetown Hoyas are one of the.few Big East
teams that gave Pitt a hard time when the two played earlier this
season.

“We played very well,” said Coach Sue Woodstra. “We
executed very well. I was very pleased. I don’t think we made
any unforced errors. The serving was good, and serving always
gives you a good idea where the concentration is.

“Everybody served well. They hit the spots. [Senior co-

’ captainjenelle Lantagne] ran the attack well.” In a match against

Akron last Wednesday, the team had 23 service errors. It only
had four Saturday.

Lantagne and junior middle hitter Dee MacAuley tied for the
team lead in digs with nine. Junior outside hitter Linda Zols was
tops on the team with nine kills to go along with a .562 kill
percentage. The team kill percentage for Pitt was .316 compared
to only .063 for Seton Hall.

The Lady Panthers head to State College next weekend for the
Penn State Tournament. They face the Lady Lions Friday before
facing Texas-Arlington and William and Mary on Saturday.

Pitt will be looking to avenge an earlier loss this year, when
Penn State came to Fitzgerald Field House and beat Pitt in three
games Oct. 14.

‘ “I don’t know if revenge is the right word,” Adarnson said.
“I'm excited to play them again. I'd like to play them better than
we did. We were so close that first game [in the previous
meeting with Penn State]. It would be really cool to come back
and at least go longer, at least go ﬁve games with them.”

One major difference from the last match might be the health
of the Lady Panthers. Junior outside hitter Bridget Gary had just
come back from a knee injury and played sparingly against
Penn State. It is questionable if she will play this weekend
because she injured the knee again.

Collier returns to collegiate V-ball
scene after stint with national team

By Linda Holley
siaﬁ Writer

After two years with the U.S.
Women’s National Team, former
Pitt volleyball coach Shelton
Collier has decided to return to
coaching on the collegiate level.
He hopes to have a position by
this December.

“I had a great experience with
the U. S. national team. It was
something I always wanted to
do," said Collier. “But now’s the
time to re-enter the college scene.

There will be some good jobs

opening up.”

Collier was in town last week
to watch the Pitt—Notre Dame
women’s volleyball match.
Among
considering are Notre Dame,
Fresno State and California
Polytechnic at San Luis/Obispo,
which boasts one of the best
teams in the country.

From 1980 to 1989 Collier was
head coach for the Lady Panthers

‘before taking the position of
-assistant coach for the national

team.

Collier took a month off in
1988 to accompany the national
team to Seoul, South Korea, for
the Summer Olympic Games. He
returned to ﬁnish the season at
Pitt, and in the winter of 1989 left
to officially coach with the
national team on a full-time basis
in San Diego.

During his time at Pitt, Collier
led the Lady Panthers to three Big
East championships and ﬁnished
with a 296-93-0 record.

“You can bet that once I get a

the schools he is"

job, I’m going to want to come
back to Pittsburgh and bring my
team here because it’s a great
place to come and play," Collier
said.

Collier recruited all but two of
the present Lady Panthers, so he
admitted there will be mixed
emotions when he does return to
play against the people he once
trained.

“We'll go for the win, but I’ll
have strong sentiments about the
players’ that are still here,” he
said. “I would wish them the best
in every match all season, except
that one,” he added with a
chuckle.

Collier has tried to stay abreast
of Pitt’s success, and he considers
‘himself one of its biggest fans. He
credits present head coach Sue
Woodstra with doing an excellent
job with the team.

“In ﬁnding a new coach, the
administration did well in signing
Sue Woodstra because of her
past experience as captain of the
Olympic team in 1984," said
Collier. He added that the kind of
experience Woodstra has cannot
be taught or replaced. “She's an
excellent player and transfers that
experience to the players. She
provides them with a good
background.”

Woodstra and Collier have
different styles of coaching, but
Collier believes this has
contributed to Pitt’s continual
success.

“I think it’s a complementary
situation for the players — having
two different styles of coaching
— but two good styles of

coaching,” explained Collier.

He did express some concern
for what would happen to the
team and the program after he
left, but he has been reassured
many times over that the players
are in good hands.

“Pitt won the Big Eastflast year,
and they’re No. 1 in the Big East
this year, so they have maintained
and even improved on that
tradition,” said Collier. “The thing
this team has done better than
when I coached is they’ve
maintained their 16th—place
ranking for the whole season.
That’s significant because on
some of the teams I had, although
we were as talented, they were in
and out of the Top 20.”

Because of this consistency in
play, Collier has high hopes for
this year’s. team.

“I think they have a chance to
be the ﬁrst team in Pitt history to
win a first—round NCAA match
and move into the Mid—East
regionals,” he said. “Once they
get to the Mid—East regionals,
anything could happen. They
would only be two wins away
from the Final Four.”

Under Collier, the Lady Panthers
qualiﬁed regularly for the NCAA
Tournament, but they often drew
a top-five team and were defeated
in the ﬁrst round. Collier’s team
continually did well scholastically,
also. In 1986, 70 percent of the
players made dean’s list and the
athletic director's honor roll.

“Winning volleyball is very
important, but being successful

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Tuesday, November 6, 1990

 

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Pitt wrestling coach Rande
Stottlemyer should be proud. Two
of his boys decided to play football
as walk-ons this year. And Lance
Markel andjoe Conlon are doing
something many walk-ons never
achieve in any sport. They actually
play, and well to boot.

Markel, a fullback, was Pitt’s
leading rusher with 23 yards
against the much—heralded Miami
Hurricanes, who are now back in

‘ a realistic hunt for the national

championship. Markel finished
ahead of both Kevin Williams
and Glenn Deveaux.

Conlon, a fullback last week,
magically turned into a defensive
end this week -—— a defensive end
wearing No. 26.

Conlon had four tackles (three
solo) and a fumble recovery
against the Hurricanes. Conlon’s
offensive counterparts did
absolutely nothing with the
opportunity he presented them
with, but that was the theme for
the day.

Conlon’s contribution turned
out to be a drop in the bucket on
the stat sheets, but it was quite
significant in this new player’s
development.

Gone were the jitters, the
“Where did this Conlon guy come
from?” questions and the thought
that maybe this fellow couldn’t
cut the mustard.

Some wrestler was out on the
soggy, near-capacity Orange
Bowl field, knocking the crap out
of people and picking up loose
balls in a stadium flooded with
green and orange on home-
coming weekend —— against one
of the country’s best college
football teams. Must be a long
way from the wrestling mats at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“It was great, and I want to
thank Coach Hackett and Coach
vonAppen for giving me the
opportunity to play. When the
opportunity comes, you've got to
rise to the occasion,” Conlon said.

Ah, they already have the
converted wrestler speaking

football-media-ese. How many
times have you heard the above
quote?

But fear not, the 6—foot—l-inch,
245-pound senior from Miller
Place, N.Y., is a unique spiritualist
at heart. He’s into techniques that
many consider wacky by nature.
After all, if you just picture
something in your head, how can
it possibly come true? Sounds
like the land of make-believe.

Or not.

“It's always been a dream for

me to play Division 1 football.
And I believe in visualization;
I’ve always visualized since I was
a kid. And this is it —- it’s my
dream come true,” Conlon said.

Somehow the thought of
picturing a massive defensive
end/heavyweight
utilizing spiritual techniques
seems a little bit contradictory.
After all, aren’t these the guys
who are supposed to have no
concept of such thoughts? Well,
meet the exception.

Conlon is a transfer from West
Point, where he played under
Coach Jim Young. Upon coming
to Pitt, he took up wrestling last
year as a team heavyweight and
may wrestle again this season.

Conlon served -as a fullback in
short—yardage situations against
Notre Dame two weeks ago —
primarily a blocking back, a la
“The Refrigerator.” And he was
more impressed with the Irish,
rather than the Hurricanes.

“The offensive linemen [at
Miami] are very big, and they
move you, but they’re not as
physical as Notre Dame,” Conlon
said. “The crowd was arrogant
here [at Miami], but everyone
was cheering, and it was like
being in the Super Bowl.”

If the thou ght of being a wrestler
and a football player coupled
with visualization techniques is
hard to swallow, just think how it
must feel for that person to
suddenly be playing against two
of the premier teams in the
country back-to-back in his first
season.

Or just try to picture it in your
head.

‘Three—peat’ possible for one of the

greatest defensive

The Detroit Pistons are talking three-peat, so
that must mean that they intend to win the NBA’s
Central Division first. Chuck Daly is back to lead the
world champions, and only the “I” word (injuries)
stands in the way of perhaps the greatest defensive
team ever.

Isiah Thomas (18.4 points per game, 9.4 assists
per game), Joe Dumars (17.8 ppg) and Vinnie
Johnson comprise the lea gue’s three-guard rotation.
Dennis Rodman is the best one-on—one rotation in
basketball. 6

teams in NBA

improve upon last year’s 42-40 record and get
beyond the first round of the playoffs. All-Star
Reggie Miller (24.6 ppg) is one of the NBA’s best
pure shooters. Look for Rik Smits to be one of the
league’s better centers this season. Forward Chuck
Person (19.7 ppg) can score but needs to work
harder on the boards. I

The Cleveland. Cavaliers can be very
competitive, but they are going to have a hard time
attaining a high level of play this season. Their first
mistake was matching

Inside scoring may be ~ . . . the Miami Heat’s offer to
the only weakness of   John “HotRod” Williams
this team. James . . (16.8 ppg). Mark Price
Edwards (14.5 ppg) is (19.6 ppg)isafine floor

the Pistons’ only legitimate inside scorer. Bill
Laimbeer and John Salley are effective players but
are not scoring threats in the low post.

Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls made a
run at the Pistons last year and look to do so again
in 1990-91. Jordan (33.6 ppg) should lead the
league in scoring for the fifth consecutive year and
seriously contend for the MVP trophy.

Veterans Dennis Hopson and Cliff Leginston
have been added to make the Bulls’ bench somewhat
comparable to Detroit’s, but the inconsistency of
Bill Cartwright and Craig Hodges will hurt in
Chicago’s championship quest.

If the Bulls are to reach their potential, second-

, year men Stacey King and B.J. Armstrong must

emerge this season. _
This year’s surprise team could be the Adan

\ Hawks. New coach Bob Weiss takes over for the

departed Mike Fratello. Weiss is expected to install
Fnorel of a passing-game offense, but more
importantly he will not berate and alienate the
players like Fratello did. If Dominique Wilkins
(26.7 ppg) can adapt his tremendous athletic skills
to Weiss’ philosophies, the Hawks could really ﬂy.

Rumeal Robinson looks to be the starting point
guard and should contend for Rookie of the Year.
Center Moses Malone is said to be on the trading
block, but if he stays, he will give the Hawks, at the

ve least, adequate play in the pivot.
   Q39 ﬁ0(‘£Di€ hr-A f--v;.-‘I. 4..
1c ersaces iana acers are trying to

Collier

leader but has some problems on defense. Shooting
guard Craig Ehlo’s game is better for coming off the
bench. Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance play
somewhat soft defensively inside. Danny Ferry has
to soon realize that he is no longer playing in Italy.

It is hard to imagine the Milwaukee Bucks not
being in the playoffs, but it may well happen,
unless Del Harris does one of the best coaching
jobs of all time. The guard rotation is fine with Alvin

‘ Robertson, Jay Humphries and sensational sixth

man Ricky Pierce. However, the frontcourt rotation
is going to be a nightmare. All of the Bucks’ big men
have glaring weaknesses: Dan Schayes and Frank
Brickowski (speed), Jack Sikma (age) and Brad
Lohaus (talent). Milwaukee has solid, if not

spectacular, forwards in Greg “Cadillac” Anderson -

and Fred Roberts.

The Charlotte Hornets continue to suffer from
growing pains, but a 20—win season is within reach.
J.R. Reid continues to play out of position due to
Charlotte’s deficiencies at center. Tyrone “Mugsy”
Bogues can push it but is a defensive liability at 5
feet, 3 inches. Rex Chapman and Armon Gilliam are
promising young talents for the Hornets. Free-
agent signee Johnny Newman figures to push out
Kelly Tripucka at small forward. Rookie Kendall
Gill’s athleticism cannot hurt the Hornets’ cause. If
Gill catches on to the progame quickly; look for
shooting guard Dell Curry to be traded for someone
who at least has a center’s body.

A a cliche with my program,” stated

Collier. He was glad to" see that
Woodstra continues to emphasize
this, noting how many of the
players have improved their
grades since he left.

“That’s another real selling point
about Pitt volleyball because as
recruits consider Pitt as a place to

go, they also look that the team
does well academically and they
are serious students. It’s a good
combination of volleyball and
schooling,” said Collier.

He believes with the team
playing Top 20 volleyball, it will
be able to select the best players
from different regions and have a

successful team that can compete .

Pitt currently is competing well
nationally. It defeated San Diego
State, which is recognized as a
volleyball powerhouse, and
Colorado State, which has
traditionally been a top 10 team.

Collier said the reason the Lady

because they are a mature and

their maturity and composure
helps them beat teams that have

are prevalent on college teams.
Collier again acknowledged
Woodstra’s coaching. “Sue is a

“It’s an exciting time for the team,
