Sorority rated best
chapter in nation by
national leadership

By Linda Marie Micco
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
chapter of Alpha Epsilon Phi was
recently awarded the
Achievement and Excellence
award by their national
headquarters.

“We are extremely proud
because they have made
incredible strides toward
becoming one of our top
chapters,”, said Bonnie
Rubenstien, AEPhi national
executive director. “They were
most deserving of our highest
honor”

Every two years, AEPhi national
officials consider 40 sororities
across the country for the award
after analyzing detailed reports
filled out by the chapter

presidents. Using a numerical

point system, theofficials score
every aspect of sorority life
including academic "excellence,
recruitment activities and fund-
raising work.

“It was a very straightforward
scoring system,” Rubenstien said.
“They won hands down.”

Renae Spector, president of
Pitt’s AEPhi chapter, attended the
national convention in Arizona
this pastjune where she and two
other sorority members accepted
the award, a plaque bearing the
sorority insignia.

“We really thought one of the
larger chapters would win,”
Spector said. “Oh my God, it was
amazing. They Called out our

name and we freaked out. That
feeling that every AEPhi in the
country knows that we’re No. 1.”

Spector, together with Susan
Klein, former chapter president,
filled out the reports for each of
the two years.

In September of 1987, AEPhi
had 23 active members and has
since boosted their membership
through rush activities to 65, the
maximum allowed at Pitt.

“Ever since then [I987], we
were so gung—ho,” Spector said.
“The sorority has done a 360-
degree turn in two years. It’s
incredible."

Pitt’s AEPhi chapter placed first
in the charity portion of the Greek
Week functions last year. The
money they raised, through

.canning and from alumni

donations was given to Special

Olympics.
The women of AEPhi also
distinguished themselves

academically. Forty percent of
the women made the dean’s list
and several of the sisters also
belong to the university honor
society.

The sorority, according to
Spector, is getting more name
recognition on campus. A '

“We’re big. We’re proud to be
big," she said.

The AEPhi national convention
will be held again in two years.
“Hopefully we’ll do it again,”
Spector added.

Italian Parliament bestows science award on Pitt professor

By Arthur Clark
For The Pitt News

 A University of Pittsburgh‘
“faculty member recently set

several precedents in being
chosen to receive the 1989
Fregene Prize for Science.

Dr. Adolf Grunbaum, Andrew
Mellon Professor of Philosophy,
is the first non-Nobel Laureate to
receive this honor for scientific
endeavors from the Italian
government. In receiving this
award, Grunbaum has also

“J become the first to be honored

for work not limited to the field of
the natural sciences.

Dr. Alec Stewart, dean of the
University Honors College, said
of Dr. Grunbaum: “He is known
for his dual dedication to both
research and

undergraduate students. He is
very good at what he does and he
is also a very warm person.”

The Fregene Prize, sponsored
chieﬂy by the Italian Parliament,
was given to Dr. Grunbaum on
Saturday, Sept. 9, in Rome. The
honor was bestowed him by
Professor Antonio Ruberti,
minister for research and
Universities and past president of
the University of Rome. The
ceremony was broadcast live on
Italian national television.

The prize was initiated five
years ago by the Italian
government. The name of the
prize is taken from the Fregene
District of the city of Rome which
holds signiﬁcance in the academic
history of Italy.

The plaque which Dr.
Grunbaum received is itself a

work of art. Mounted into the
face of the plaque is an extremely
valuable sculpture by the famous
Italian sculptor and painter Sassu.

Dr. Grunbaum has held several"

different positions in the
university faculty during his 29
years here at Pitt. He has held the
Andrew Mellon Professor of
Philosophy endowed chair since
1960. He served as director of
Pitt’s Center for Philosophy of
Science in the years from 1960 to
1978, becoming chairman in 1978.

In addition to the positions he
has held in the faculty, he has
held the office of president of the
eastern division of the American
Philosophical Association and
served two terms as president of
the Philosophy of Science
Association. He is presently
serving as research professor of

psychiatry and chairman of Pitt’s
Center for Philosophy of Science
as well as continuing his tenure
as the Andrew Mellon Professor
of Philosophy. Dr. Grunbaum is
a fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science, a member of the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and a Laureate of the

International Academy of
Humanism.
Dr. Grunbaum has written

articles and books dealing with
many different aspects of the
philosophy of science. His most
recent book, The Foundations of
Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical
Critique, received very favorable
press from mainstream media
organizations such as The New
York Times and the Italian news
magazine L’Espnesso, which is

Italy’s equivalent of Time’

Ma‘g’a.zine. Dr. Grunbaum
describes the book as “a critique
of A Freudian theory that did
produce a great stir.” Another of
Dr. Grunbaum’s major works is
Philosophical Problems of Space
and Time.

Dr. Grunbaum was born in
Cologne, Germany on May 15,
.1923. He’ graduated from
Connecticut's Wesleyan
University receiving a B.A. with
Highest Distinction in Philosophy
and Mathematics. He received
both his M.S. in,Physics and his
Ph.D. in Philosophy from Yale.

In 1985, he traveled through
Scotland on the Gifford Lectures
tour and delivered the Werner
Heisenberg Lecture to the
Bavarian Academy of Sciences in
Munich, B.R.D.

Pitt dean's list stricter

By Jennifer Calabrese
For The Pitt News

Keeping up with the Joneses
has always been a primary
concern ofmany Americans. That
popular attitude has seemingly
found its way into the offices of
Pitt’s College of Arts and Sciences.

During an evaluation of policies
and procedures two years ago,
College of Arts and Sciences Dean
Mary Louise Briscoe changed the
criteria for students to make the
Dean’s list.

“Looking at our criteria against
that of comparable universities,
we realized that ourstandards
[for the Dean’s list] V were
somewhat low,” Briscoe said.’

Before then, students were
required to carry a full load of 12
credits and have a Q.P.A. of at
least 3.25. Briscoe raised the
Q.P.A. requirement to 3.5. On
the average, 1,500 students used
to make the list. Since the change,
the average has dropped to 1,000.

“There certainly haven’t been
any complaints about the new
policy. Everyone seems to be
satisfied,” Briscoe said.

She also ‘ redesigned the

For The Pitt News

Sera-Tec Biologicals is
providing the opportunity for Pitt
students to fill their pockets, their
stomachs and perhaps, to save a.
life.

In return for donating plasma,

‘ 3’ students receive money and free,

pizza from Sera~Tec. ’

According to Leslie Yeager,
general manager of Sera-Tec,
there is a great need for plasma.
In fact, due to the fear of AIDS,
donations have dropped
considerably pushing the need
to critical.

Plasma, the liquid part of blood,
can be used as anti-hemophiliac
drugs, for burn patients who tend
to lose a tremendous amount of
body ﬂuids, and as a laboratory
reagent for blood
grouping.

Rogam, a plasma derivative,
prevents a mother with negative-
type blood from rejecting a fetus
with positive-type blood.

Plasma donation is similar to
blood donation except the packed
red blood cells are returned to
the body.

As far as the amount of pain
involved, Yeager said, “it's a

O‘ needle, but there’s not such a

severe pinch as in a regular
needle. It’s [the needle] going
into the vein instead of the
muscle.”

which is the second part of the
recognition, besides -having the
list publicly posted each semester.

“The Dean’s list is a recognition
on a term-by-term basis for
outstanding academic
achievement,” Briscoe said.

Although most universities,
such as Penn State, do keep the
Q.P.A. requirement at 3.5, there
are a few that stray above and
below that norm.

At Temple, only a 3.2 is needed
for freshmen, and upperclassmen
need a 3.3 to make the list. The

Placement Center offers career advice to students in need

By Patrick Kennedy
and Leon Fuksman

' For The Pitt News

Hangovers, lousy food and a
roommate with bad, breath —
believe it or not, Pitt does offer
more to its students.

The Pitt Placement Center in
the William Pitt Union gives
readily obtainable Career
information and advice. As the
center’s director Robert Hopkins

‘explained, “When skills are

required you can acquire them
here.”

By offering workshops, job fairs
and direct links with employers
who offer internships, the Pitt
Placement Center is geared to
enable students to gain practical
training. The philosophy of the
center is to create an awareness
of the business world within the
university.

Though today's employers do
want to see good grades in school,
Hopkins said, “The single key
characteristic that employers go
for is communication skills.”

According to Hopkins,
companies want people who can

think and have good ideas. With

Pitt offering classes in reading,"

writing and public speaking, he
said such prerequisite skills are
easily obtainable.

Over 500 companies actively
recruit through the Pitt Placement
Center. Even though these
companies are often looking for
more technically-oriented people,
engineers and scientists, Hopkins
said the liberal arts students need
not worry. ’

“If you look at Fortune 500

college graduates go to these

Her body, ber cboice

It’s a man’s world, but it’s a wornan’s body. ‘

Then why has a judge recently ordered a 26-year-old
woman not to have . an abortion —— only because her
boyfriend wants the baby? I g,

c He is not the one who has to carry the child for nine

. months. He does not have to go through labor and

delivery. He does not have to suffer the emotional and

professional stresses that go along with carryinga child

full term. So why does he have a say in whether or not she
has this baby, simply because he had sex with her?

, The Supreme Court had the right idea when they ruled

S in 1976 that a husband cannot veto his wife’s decision to

have an abortion. Since then, this ruling has been applied‘

to non—rnarried couples as well. However, the current
0 status of the law is now in question-, especially in Penn-
sylvania. In other states, similar injunctions have been
. struck down’ — and rightly so. I I
It is sad‘ that fathers of unborn babies have virtually no
i right to their children, but it must be so. In order for a
woman to have control over her own body, she must
retain the right to terminate a pregnancy without having
to ask the permission of the biological father.
It is likely that the woman will prevail in the end, but she
‘-3 is forced to wait and undergo the harassment of fighting
for a right that is hers in the first place. For the sake of
women everywhere, the law must remain as is —- after all,
it is still her body and her choice.

W/bo bots baby ozddzcts?

What kind of a pregnant woman would abuse drugs
while in such a delicate state?

Judging by the fact that doctors have reported almost
twice as many black women as white women, it would be
safe to assume that more pregnant black women have

*3 been found to be endangering the lives of their future
children. Or would it?

In reality, the number of white women found to be
abusing drugs is approximately 15.4 percent; in compari-
son with a slightly lower 14.1 percent of black females. If
this is true, then why is the number of reported cases of
abuse by black women so much higher?

The answer lies in the fact that the doctors have been
testing black women at a rate at least 10 times higher than

,3 that of white women. What this means is that doctors have
been missing a large portion of cases due to their inability
to suspect white, middle-class women. Obviously, it is a
misconception that these women are less likely to abuse
drugs.

It is a good idea to find any woman who could be
harming her child in this way, no matter what color her

‘skin is. Doctors and everyone else as well, need to learn
to look past a person’s race in order to deal more
effectively with problems such as this one.

attitude, are the major corpora-
tions and governments of the
world. And in the opposite cor-
ner, the challenger, Greenpeace
and similar pro-environment
organizations, representing the
plants andanimals (including
humans) of the planet Earth;
weighing in with meager‘ public
donations, limited government
concern and a strong desire that
your children will not have to
wear NASA-type spacesuits each
time they leave the house.

Now that you have been intro-
duced to the combatants, it is
time to choose sides. It should
not be a hard decision to make,
that is provided that you have
even a grain of moral fiber in
your body. Now you are proba-
bly waiting for me to start ram-
bling on and on about how cor-
porations should be made to stop
polluting and killing and that the
government should enter the fray
and pass stricter laws to protect
the Earth. However, you would
be quite wrong in that assump-
tion. This column is directed at
you, the average citizen, and what
you can do to put a stop to the
murder of the Earth as we know
It.

The first step in the process of
becoming an aware guardian of
the environment is simple. STOP
LIITERING! Conveniently situ-
ated across campus and in most
metropolitan areas are garbage
cans. Use them. If you are in your
car either carry a garbage bag
with you or set your trash on the
floor until you have the chance to
throw it away properly. Do not
pitch it out the window. If an-
other passenger wishes to toss
something, take the burden off
his hands and dispose of it your-
self.. Hopefully, our foot-drag-
ging government will get around
to solving the waste dump prob-

- lem soon.
Speaking of dump sites, one I

solution to solving the problem is
to make less waste. When the

btle to the death 0

government finally gets around
to implementing waste separa-
tion laws (having different bags
for aluminum, glass, etc.), do not
grumble about the, extra five
minutes it will take you, each

garbage day. Instead, support
these programs. At least it is a
step in the right direction.
Recycle is the word for the day.
Remember it. At this point you

N are probably laughing and say-

ing, “Sure, I'll bust my assr:ollect—
ing cans and bottles for a penny
apiece.” Several states have found
an easy way around this prob-
lem. By putting a five cent de-
posit on every can or bottle,
Massachusetts and many other
states have put a dent in the
number of - cans and bottles
thrown away. It is not uncom-
mon in these states to see people
at concerts and other major events
walking around collectingdis-
carded cans. After all, by collect-
ing only 200 cans, a frugal person
will have enough money to buy
a case of beer and have a head
start on their next 200 cans and
another case. I

Another way for a concerned
Pitt student to make a difference
is to push for our university to
start recycling. While working as
a part-time custodian for Pitt this
summer, I noticed that at least 90
percent of rubbish created here is
paper. Theluniversity employees
could be required to separate the
paper. With the new source of
income, the university could raise
the employees salaries slightly as
a thank you for their extra time
and effort and still probably have
enough left over to abolish that
ridiculous computer fee. As the
“molders of the future,” I think
the university community has the
responsibility to grasp problems
like the environment and start
the ball rolling to resolve these
problems. What do you think,
Wes?

I realize that all of the pro-
business right-wingers out there

  

f the earth

are going to cringe at this next
proposal, but it seems to be about
the only way a common citizen

can influence a major corpora- .

tion — boycott. Sure, corporate

America will tell you that by ,

boycotting them you will only
hurt the little guy, but what other
option do they leave us with? If
a corporation's
shunned by enough people, they
will get the message. After all,

‘profit is the only thing that mat- I I

ters to these ogres. Sure, if we
boycott Exxon some of the inde-
pendent operators of Exxon
stations will be hurt, but maybe

these operators should have

thought of that before signing a
contract with an exploitative
money-hungry corporation.
Although I only mentioned
Exxon as a target for boycott (for
obvious reasons), there are other,
not so obvious targets such as
McDonald’s. Has anyone other
than myself noticed that they

seem to be the only major fast I

food chain still using those Styro-
foam containers for their food?
You might be wondering what
that has to do with the environ-
ment. Well, it is as simple as the
word chloroﬂuorocarbon. Those
convenient little boxes have’ a
way of releasing such chemicals
’ which mean bad times for Mother
Earth. Remember though, let these
corporations know that you are

boycotting them and why. It only

takes five minutes to write them
a little note and 25 Centsfor a
stamp. Tell your friends too, so
you can all get in on the fun of
corporation bashing. These are
not thetonly corporations that
deserve the dreaded boycott, but
I am pretty sure if you read the

news you will find reasons to

boycott all kinds of companies.

Although ‘it's not a complete
list of everything you can do to
become a protector of Mother
Earth, this will get you started.

Hopefully, we as the common _

citizens and inhabitants of this
planet can make a difference and
our children will know the joy of
walking among trees and swim-
ming in the ocean.

The Pitt football team--has been

off for two weeks, butdefensive

exactly been hibernating, as he is

Last year, \the‘Pitt women's swim team

Siragusa says this will work to
Pitt’s advantage.

“We had a couple daysoff last
week, but I think we have a little

bit of an edge with the open

toward them, where [Syracuse]
just started preparing for us today

help in the distance freestyle events so he
recruited more distance swimmers.

This move was inspired by an article

claim in the top 20. Pitt now sits
at a comfortable number 14 in
the latest Associated Press poll.

However, these numbers, or
any poll for that matter, do not
make the slightest difference to
Siragusa, as he and the team cite
loftier goals as their main
objective. »

We just try to progress every
week and try to get better,”
Siragusa said.

“T 0 tell you the truth, I don’t

says that the rankings of other
teams in the nation do not affect
the way in which Pitt prepares for
each game. Each team is taken as
an individual case and is attacked
at full throttle by the Panthers.

young football team attempts to

develop itself over the course or)‘

won _ its seventh consecutive Big East
championship. The team had a lot of
quality veterans, but its freshman and
sophomore swimmers were the key to
winning events.

In fact, the last two recruiting years for
head coach David Belowich have proved
to be among his best.

Although they are not proven yet, the
1989 freshman class could make this year’s
team one of the 20 best in the nation.

“I certainly look for good things to come
from them, they will make our team much
better," said Belowich. “We have some
athletes now, and with our combinations
of relays, I think we can make NCAA’s in
several relays and score in the meet. .That’s
how you get ranked in the top 20.”

Belowich couldn’t directly comparethis
year's freshman class with that of the last
few years. He explained that a teams’
needs are different from year to year. Last
year, he needed breast stroke help, so he
got two of the best in Karen Masal and

Belowich read in a swimming magazine.
The article ‘was entitled, “The Lonely
Distance Lane”, and is about the way that
long distance swimmers often have to
train alone, because not many people
specialize in it.

“I figured we have sprinter lanes, breast
stroke lanes, and butterfly lanes, why
should there be only one distance lane?"
said Belowich.

Here’s a quick look at the newcomers to
this year's Lady Panther swim team:

0 Triana Thames. A versatile swimmer
from Eau Claire, Wis., who made the
olympic trail cuts in her high school days.
Thames was recruited mainly as a
backstroker, but will be effective as a
freestyle sprinter and butterﬂier as well.

0 Jill Comeau. Belowich said she was
the second fastest distance freestyler
recruited by eastern teams.

0 Kirstie Beltz. A sprint freestyler from
Rochester, Pa., Belowich is not sure exactly
what to expect from her. She was the only

from Emrnaus, Pa., according to Belowich.
She is skilled in the breast stroke and
butterﬂy’ events and can be a big help for
the individual medley. D

0 Suzi McManus. A Virginia . product
who will add even more depth for the
distance events.

0 Clane McShane. She will add both
depth and versatility to the Panthers free
style scheme. From New Jersey, she is
equally talented in the 50, 100, 200, and
500 yard events.

- Amy Plesz. She is similar to Beltz in
that her Ohio school wasn’t known to be
a big swimming school, therefore Belowich
isn’t sure how far the sprinter can go.

0 Julie Rocks. She is a transfer student
from Maryland. She was a state champion
butterﬂier for Bethel Park High School.

- Jenni Sari. She is the sister of Liz Sari,
who is a junior on the Pitt swim team. The
Mechanicsburg, Pa. freshman will
contribute yet more depth to the distance
event.

After watching Michigan and
Notre Dame go at it Fiesta Bowl-
style this past weekend, I’m more
than a little concerned about Pitt's
visit to South Bend, Ind., on Oct.
28.

Notre Dame’s defensive line
was matched against a huge
Michigan blocking line averaging
well over 280 pounds per player.
Many seasoned self-proclaimed
football gurus believed that these
two teams matched evenly in all
aspects except in the trenches.

And, as you know, this is where
games are won, as Notre Dame
illustrated.

 

Pitt knows something itself
about speed vs. size on the
defensive line. Present NFLer Burt
Grossman along with potentially

future NFLers Tony Siragusa and

T 0 the paranoid masses, it's never
too early to t/om/e about Notre Dame

Marc Spindler all know the value
of quickness and technique in
the defensive line positions. (No,
I haven't forgotten about the
intelligently inspiring ingenious
graduate student muscleman,
Carnell Smith.)

Thus, Pitt’s obvious offensive
deﬁciencies glare, blindingly, like
3-D glasses held up to a solar
eclipse.

I’m not saying that Pitt ought to

be quaking in their new demon ‘

up to that billing or not is a
judgement call. 'Ihis week, against
a highly ranked team, is where
the real test of that statement will
manifest ‘itself, according to
Siragusa.

a real challenge. Their offensive
line is ranked number one in the
country and after the game this

THE TRUTH (;oEs BONG!

I Did you ever notice ‘how the Truth goes BONG
and a lie goes PLINK? One of those old true silver
coins goes BONG when dropped, but a slug goes

. PLINK! Phonies are easily detected. It’ s true with
metal; it’ s true with people, too. Abe Lincoln, Dr. Al-
bert Schweitzer, and Mother Teresa go BONG! Hitler
and the Ayatollah Khomeini go PLINK! .

Now look at Christianity. There are millions of
people who claim to be Christian, but some are
counterfeits. How can you tell the difference? Well,
listen with your head and your heart for the truth. It

' will ring true; it will strike a chord. When Jesus spoke .

He was no phony. Lives were changed. People

his light issues forth. I-Iis truth is still spoken, but you

him and judge for yourself.

So give us a listen. We think you'll hearBONG!
Remember only valuable things are worth copying.
You never see counterfeit brown paper bags. You do

that which is true. Truth will always go BONG! Jesus
