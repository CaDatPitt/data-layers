Wemer Resigns Post
‘As Med School Dean

By T0_ KUKUCKA

_ Pitt ewsStaffWriter

Gerhard Werner resigned his
position as dean of Pitt’s School of
Medicine, effective today. The
resignation was announced by
Nathan J_. Stark, vice-chancellor of
the School of Health Related
Professions. .

Werner, who has held the post
for the last four years, will assume
new duties as a professor in the
department of psychiatry at West-
ern Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

“He offered his resignation to
the chancellor through Nathan
Stark,” said‘ Robert Hickey, vice-
chancellor for the Health Related
Professions. “The. decision was

- made to accept the resignation

regretfully.” .

Werner could not be reached for
comment. I

Hickey said he believes Werner

I had become discouraged over the

state and federal governments’

. inability to provide sufﬁcient aid to»

relieve rising medical costs and to
avoid increases in tuition. The
medical school received no increase
over last year’s state appropriation,
and the net result was higher
tuition for students and no increase
in salaries for faculty‘ members, as

well as cutbacks in the medical 

school staff.

In-state medical students must
now pay $5,000 for tuition in
1978-79, an increase of 25 percent.
Out-of-state students pay $7,000 in
tuition.

“As far as the administration
could ascertain,” Hickey said, “he
stepped down because the resourc-
es that he had anticipated from the
Commonwealth had not materializ-
ed, and he was unable to come up
with any ideas thatwould make it
possible to come up with new

resources. Heran out of ways and
means to reallocate existing re-
sources.”

“We are grateful for all the good
things he has done,” Hickey
added.

‘ Chancellor Posvar had high_

praise for Werner and warned of
the ﬁnancial crisis medical schools
face today in a statement released
over the weekend.

“In this most difﬁcult period for
all of medical education in
America, when all deans have been
under pressure to adjust to reduced
ﬁnancial support from government
and to set new priorities,‘ Gerhard
Werner had performed ‘notably
well, with foresight, courage and

.imagination,” reads the statement.

“Medical schools in America are
under close ﬁnancial constraint _and
face the need for reassessment and
setting of new goals. These must
include both expanded efforts in
research and improvement in
cost-effectivness of health care
delivery systems. We have a great
medical school, and during the next
year we shall be making decisions
about personnel and resources that
will ensure its continued success

* and even greater progress in the A
’ next decade.” '

Associate Dean Donald F. Leon
will assume the position of acting
dean.

According to Hickey, a search
committee composed of both
faculty and students will probably‘

. be appointed sometime this week.

“It’s likely that we would set that
committee up and running this
month,” Hickey said.

But Hickey added that the search
would be time consuming and a
new dean would most likely not be
chosen before July’ 1.

Disappearance. Ends With Navy Hitch"  

By ED TACK '

The “search for self“ of a Pitt
student may have ended at the San
Diego Naval Base, much to ‘the
happiness of a Pittsburgh Common
Pleas Court Judge whose son has
been located after a ﬁve-week
disappearence.

Brian Zeleznik, 21‘, -son of
Common Pleas Court Judge Rich-
ard G-. Zeleznik and missing from
the Pittsburgh area since Aug. 30,
had signed up for a six-year hitch in
the Navy and refused to tell his
parents about it.

Conﬁrmation by Navy ofﬁcials
that thepyounger Zeleznik enlisted
in Santa Barbara, Calif;, on Aug.
11 ended ﬁve weeks of worrying by
his parents, who feared their son
may havebeen the victim of foul
play or possibly .. the prey of
someone out to revenge a
conviction by his father. The ﬁrst
hint of trouble came when Brian’s
care was found abandoned in front
of the Stanley Theater downtown,
Aug. 2.

“When you ﬁnd the son of a

judge missing, you get the feeling

that a person who had been
convicted.by the Judge would be
letting his anger out, said
Pittsburgh City Police Captain
Therese Rocco, a Pitt graduate and
head of the city’s Missing Person’s
Bureau. ‘

g“This is a sick society,” said
Rocco. “And things‘ like this are
expected to happen.”

Police speculate that the younger
Zeleznik decided the car was not in
good enough mechanical condition
to make a cross-country trip, and
this prompted him either to

hi-tchhike or take a bus‘ to.

California.

The discovery of the younger Zel-.
eznik at the San Diego base ended
an intensive search conducted by
the -Missing Persons Bureau, city
and state Police and the student’s
parents.

The parents accompanied police or
conducted their own investigations
on numerous occasions in previous
weeks, checking up on a not-yet-
false clue to their son’s where
abouts. -

F01‘ at least. two-and-a-half weeks

police searched for “someone
ﬁtting Brian’s description who had
been seen in numerous‘ spots
-around town.” That. “someone”
was merely a look-alike, however.

‘ ‘Brian apparently has a double, ’ ’
said Rocco. “If the judge wasn't
with me when I met up- with the

double I would not have had any"

reason to think he was not Brian.
The resemblence was amazing.
Both were the same height and
there was only a little difference in
the color of their eyes...They even
carried the same type of wallet-
and it’s the type of wallet young
guys rarely have.”

The Judge, who worked closely
with Rocco in the search, seemed
“very apprehensive” that his son
would turn up unharmed, said
Rocco.

‘ ‘He was like any other father
might be-- apprehensive, frustrat-
ed, concerned, broad-minded- but
desperately wanting an answer,”
Rocco said.

The Judge, who did notreturn a
reporter’s A phone call late _ last

‘night, had speculated earlier in

another Pittsburgh newspaper that

the sonrhad left home for ﬁnancial ‘
reasons. ‘

"Rocco said that was possible but
believes Brian’s decision to enter
the Navy was an attempt to “assert
himself,” to “ﬁnd himself,” and
that attending Pitt was not the

P Describing Brian as “a very bright

, boy had the ability to read an entire

novel within a single night and
who never had to study to achieve
top“ grades,” «Rocco , said she
believes Brian simply “lost interest
in school and was looking for
something different.”

‘ ‘I got the feeling Brian wanted to

’ ﬁnd himself, make good on his own

and then go back to his parents and
make them then feel very proud
about his decision,” she said. .

‘ ‘And Ithink the father had very
high expectations for the boy,
which he may not have been up to
meeting,” she added.

Naval ofﬁcials conﬁrmed that the
younger Zeleznik’ had done “ex-,
tremely well” on tests qualifying
him for nuclear-power engineering
school. The Navy‘ added that it was

‘ ‘very happy to‘ have’ him. ’ ’

HARRISBURG —The pres-

19 sure has never been greater for the

‘gr-9:"

 

,state to legalize sports betting, but
Pennsylvania is a long way from
becoming a giant bookie.

“Sports betting is much easier
said than done. Iwould rule it out. I
just won't do it,” said Revenue
Secretary Milt Lopus, whose
department has the legal authority
to start a sports lottery any time it
wants.

An attorney general’s opinion in

. 1976 said the state could start taking

bets under the current lottery law.

Why We Malia The Difference

call Days, Eves & Weekend: 1

The lure is there, especially since
illegal betting is a booming
business. No one knows for sure,
but an estimated $1.74 billion is bet
on sports games—especially foot-
ball— each year in Pennsylvania
alone. ,

And the computer terminals that
operate the daily number could be
modified to spew out the latest odds
on football, basketball and baseball
games. So the mechanics are there
too.

* But the big thing is‘ proﬁts.
The bﬁrst proposal to open a sports
pool to benefit public education was

~ x.
\

made three years ago. And
discussions heat up every time
some politician ponders the idea of
meeting the demand for rising
education costs without the agony of
raising taxes.

“It’s a painless way of taxation.
It's a viable alternative to the
property tax. lt’s voluntary,
You don’t have to play if you don’t
want to,” said Donald Cox of the
state Lottery Commission.

But Lopus is more cautious.

“lt’s fraught with many perils.

“For example, we’d have to hire
a consultant to set the odds on

.‘_ 1

games. And he'd have to be in the
-locker rooms to know if some
quarter back hurt his shoulder and
could not play. And if it happens in
the middle of the week, we’d have to
change the odds,” he added.

And Gov. Milton Shapp, wary of a
push for more funds, said he will
ﬁght any attempt to pay for books
and tablets with gambling money.

“If we have come to the point
where we must turn our state into a
giant casino in order to provide the

. money needed to educate our

children, then we are truly a

L decadent society,” he said.

But lawmakers who have to fund‘

education at a time when people get Q

quite testy about paying taxes could

have the final say. It's harsh reality '

versus morality. ,

‘ ‘I agree with the governor. But if
we’re to have qualtiy education, we
have to have the revenue,” said
Sen. Joseph Smith, the chairman of

the Senate Appropriations; Com- .

mittee who's been studying the idea

for four years.

From New England town
* meetings to Midwest budget
. hearings, local officials are feeling
the sting of Proposition 13, as
protesters take aim at ‘what they
consider unnecessary spending and

unfair tax bills.
A survey by The Associated Press
and _its member newspapers found

I . ?that the casualties and potential

_casualties of antispending senti-
ment range from high school

I _football to shopping centers. Tax

assesssments are under appeal; tax

I I assessors are under ﬁre,

’ Most of the efforts are far smaller
in scope than the well-organized
, drive that led Californians to
approved Proposition 13, providing
_a 57 percent cut in property taxes.

 The California vote touched off

5 similar statewide drives in about a
dozen areas.

' picketbook issues.
‘In Kingston, Mass., a small
community south of Boston, tax
. bills soared last year because of a

V’ property‘ revaluation. This year,

l,350_peop1e turned out for the

July 15 town meeting and rejected

every increase in spending that was

proposed. '

A In Council Bluffs, Iowa, 300
-persons appeared at a June 19_

hearing on the ‘_Pottawattam.ie

“,Cou'n’ty budget, protesting a

proposed '60 percent boost . in
property taxes. The state appeals
board subsequently cut the increase
to '20 percent and two taxpayer
groups have been formed to monitor
spending and push for change.
There are numerous other
examples of officials backing down
from planned spending or tax
boosts because of public opposition
or the threat of it. Among them:
—A group called Concerned
Citizens successfully lobbied the
county commission in Williamson
County, Tenn., to reject a school
budget that would have required a
tax increase.‘ -
»—-The West Hartford, Conn.,
town council rescinded a proposed

_, budget increase after two retired

businessmen gathered more than
3,000 signatures demanding a
public referendum on the issue.
——Cumberland County, N.J.,
freeholders cited Proposition 13 as
the reason for their decision to
abandon plans to acquire a golf
course for the county recreation
department.
A —-Hundreds of Gorham, Maine,
residents turned up at town
».meetings, chanting “Cut the
budget, cut the budget.” In a July
25 referendum, voters rescinded a
$3.9 million budget which had been
approved by the town council and
schoo_l_corr_imittee. based on a tax
rate of $16.90 per_ $1,000 of
assessed valuation. Now, officials
- are working on a new budget, based
on a tax rate of $15 per $1,000 of
assessed valuation. Tax increases
' are being rejected by the voters,

 even when a rise in one levy would

be offset by a drop in another.
Nineteen Kansas cities and
counties proposed sales tax in-
creases to the voters in Aug. 1
elections. “In most of these
instances, it was a clear choice, with
a commitment on the part of the city
for substantial property tax re-
ductions,” said Ernie Mosher,
executive director of the League of
Kansas Municipalities. Despite the
commitment, 14 of the proposals
were turned down.
In Houghton County, Mich., the
defeat of a proposed property tax
* increase led to the layoff of 80
county highway owrkers. Nearby,
in the towns of Manistique and
Stephenson, high school football
was eliminated after voters rejected
two separate tax proposals.
_A highschool remodeling project
in Columbus, Neb., was the victim

_._ It also helped
 crystalize public discontent over

of voter rejection of a proposed $1.3
million bond issue.

The fate of a proposed income tax
in Jackson, Ohio, is st_il_l,in doubt.
On July 17, the city council voted to
impose a1 percent tax, starting Oct.
1. Less than a month later, faced
with petitions calling for a
referendum on the issue, the
council repealed the tax. Now,
however, it has decided to risk the
referendum Nov. 7. V g

A Nov. 7 vote also is expected in
Wausau, Wis., where a campaign is
under way to forbid the city council
from spending any tax money to
acquire land _ for a proposed
downtown shopping mall.

The tightﬁsted mood of the public
is evident even when taxes are not
immediately involved. In Porter
County, Ind., for example, strong
opposition has developed to the
formation of a county park system.
Protesters claim the system would

 

   IFoolish Spending, Unfair Levies

cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars to develop and maintain.

Not all the efforts have been
successful. In Anchorage, Alaska, a
group called the Libertarian Party
submitted a petition to amend the
city charter to require voter
approval of any new or increased
taxes. A judge ruled, however,
that the proposal could not appear
on the ballot because it would
unconstitutionally limit the munici-
pality’s abililty to levy taxes to
guarantee bond debts.

Tax collectors and assessors lnve
come under new pressure.

The Benton County, Wash.,
Board of Equalization , for example,
has received 385 appeals of its 1978
appraisals; there were only about
120 last year. In Sherman and
Palestine, Texas, suits by taxpayers

have temporarily blocked the .

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG . -Pennsyl-
vania lawmakers end their 10-“week
summer recess this week and face
an agenda seemingly far too large
for the short upcoming fall session.

“At least we’ll be busy with a lot
of debate,” said Democratic Floor
Leader Henry Messinger. “I don't
know how much we’ll accomplish in
the long run. We've got a host of
different opinions because there are
some pretty controversial things.”

At the top of the legislative
agenda for the four-week session
are overrides of Gov. Shapp’s
vetoes of death penalty and abortion
legislation.

In addition, lawmakers plan to
consider legislation spelling out the
duties of the ‘elected attorney
general, establishing a code of
ethics for public officials, amending
the new motor vehicle code,
strengthening ‘ law enforcement’s
hand against organized crime and
ofﬁcial corruption, restoring to the
state some immunity protections
from lawsuits and enacting appro-

' priations -for state aided museums

and institutions. _

With lawmakers planning time
off in October for campaigning, a
number of other major issues will
have to wait unti next year. Among
them are tax reform, energy
and hospital cost controls.

Here is a rundown on the major
bills due for action this month:

DEATH PENALTY

Gov.‘ Shapp struck down the.

death penalty bill in July after the
legislature had adjourned: for the
summer. At the time, lawmakers
vowed an override. The measure
gives juries the power to hand down
the sentence based on a_ list of
aggravating and mitigating circum-
stances.

The murder of a policeman,
ﬁreman, prison guard, hostage or
witness would be considered an
aggravating circumstance.

A defendant’s age and emotional
or mental state of mind would be
mitigating circumstances.. 9

If a jury ﬁnds any mitigating”

circumstances or cannot ﬁnd any
aggravating circumstances, it ‘ can-
not hand down the death penalty.

ABORTION

. Also I targeted for override is
Shapp’s veto of a bill that cuts off
Medicaid funding for abortions for

the poor, except when the mother’s .

life is in danger. _

In its ﬁrst trip through the
legislature, the bill passed by at
least two-thirds majorities.

FLOODPLAIN

The House leadership wants to
get a vote‘ on ﬂood plain legislation
before the session ends, according
to Charles Bacas, aide to Majority
Leader James Manderino.

The Senate-passed bill’ would
limit future building in ﬂood-prone
areas, an issue that has been kicked
around for years as several vicious
storms have caused hundreds of
millions of dollars in damages.

Unlike previous ﬂood bills, this
one comes closer. than ever to a
compromise with House members

In the past, Rep. Frank
O'Connell, R-Luzerne, has said that
ﬂood plain legislation should
compensate homeowners whose

‘properties lose value through

restrictions on building.

Under ‘the’ ‘Senate bill, the state
would help municipalities pay court
judgements that say the ﬂood plain
regulations amount to oonﬁscations

of private property.

- TAX REFORM

" I’dlike to see it but I don't know
whether there's time "left to get it
done,” Messinger said. “There's
so much debate on those things.”

A number of proposals are before
both houses. Some would gradually
eliminate the property tax while
other would do away with ‘local
nuisance taxes. _

One proposal passed by the,
Senate but now before the House
would allow different property tax
rates for business and private

Football reigns supreme at Pitt. The season is still six
days away and already most students’ conversations
revolve around the questions, “Who will be Pitt’s quar-
terback?” and “Can Pitt beat Penn State this year?”

I " “In two weeks, football mania should reach its peak

when thousands of Panther fans throng up .“cardiac
hill” to pack Pitt Stadium for the Temple game.
Pitt’s romance with the pigskin certainly hasn’t hurt
the University’s stature. Since its establishment as a
- national collegiate football power, Pitt has received
more publicity- that it had ever enjoyed, and this
recognition has spurred the generosity of football-
loving Golden Panthers who have shown almost bot-

4' » "tomless charity for the Pitt football program.

The huge amount of money spent for improvements
to Pitt Stadium and the Field House shows the em-
phasis the University athletic department.has placed on
football and intercollegiate sports in general. During
1977, the University budgeted $1.5 million for new
astroturf at the Stadium, an expanded press box, a new

W. ‘scoreboard and sound system, renovations of the

.« *1

‘ .-

 

Chancellor’s and Athletic Director’s boxes, repainting
of the Stadium and expanded football coaches’ offices
in the Stadium. The same year, the athletic department
completed the continued remodeling of office areas and
the construction of two egress ramps in the Field House
within a $250,000 budget. Other intercollegiate sports

have shared football’s affluence: athletic teams besides
football were allocated $400,000, or $1,117 per

player in 1976-1977. «
While football and other athletic teams have'been

bathed in cold cash, the athletic activities that include .-

, most students--‘intramurals and individual recreational
athletic activities—have been forgotten by the athletic
department. A report to the Senate Athletics Commit-

tee by the Sub-Committee on Intramurals a_nd~f
Recreation’ illustrates the blatant disregard ‘ that has i

been shown for intramural and recreational sports.

Their 20-page review narrates the sad tale of the '

disowning of the average Pitt student for the

gloriﬁcation of the small minority of approximately 460
athletes talented enough to participate in intercollegiate
sports.

Monopolization of athletic facilities by varsity teams
is one of the most ﬂagrant abuses carried out at the ex-
pense of intramurals and recreation activities. Facilities
are to be reserved for physical education classes from
8:30 to 11:30 a.m. and from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on week-
days, and varsity teams are to reserve playing areas
from ‘3:30 to 6:30 p.m., in season only, according to
guidelines in past years. Despite these instructions,
coaches have hogged valuable athletic space. The swim
team, soccer team and women’s gymnastics team are
three culprits the intramurals committee speciﬁcally
cited for use of facilities during off-season periods.

The 1977-1978 swimming season ended in the third
week of March, but the swimming coach retained the

‘use of the pool for the varsity team and the Pitt Aquatic

Club from 6 to 9 p.m. until the week of May 8th, ac-
cording to the intramurals committee report. The soc-
cer team reserved the Trees Hall small gym from 6 to 7
p.m. I Mondays and 6:30 to 8 p.m. Wednesdays
during the winter term for practice sessions. Besides

. violating the procedures for use of athletic facilities,

the soccer team’s indoor practices resulted - in the_
breaking of soft plaster from the gym’s ceiling, the
damaging of two clocks and the smashing of light fix-
tures and bulbs. The women’s gymnastics coach in-

~ sists the team’s equipment remain assembled in the

large gym all year, the report states. This practice
fills a valuable court that could be used for

recreational basketball, and. volleyball. A ‘ .

. These are not the only practices that inhibit the
availability of athletic facilities for intramurals and
recreation. The constant closing of the squash courts,

’ handball courts and swimming pool whenever sporting,-~ 
events are held in Trees Hall or the Field House greatlyggi

limits the accessibility of these areas.

“One reason given for the closing was that some _
"coaches deem it offensive that squash playersin gym . , ,

I report.

clothes wander through paying customers during a
scheduled event,” states the intramural committee
“Another was the fear that squash players
might abuse their access, or tricksters would dress as
squash players;.and stay to watch-the game under the
ruse of going to the squash courts.”

To correct the excesses that have become common-
place, the committee report lists nine recommendations
to help reverse the deteriorated status of intramural and
recreational sports at Pitt. Some of these are’ putting
the intramural program under the control of the
physical education department, shifting facilities coor-
dination-to the physical education department, giving
new guidelines to the intramural director and facilities
coordinator, and giving control of priorities for athletic
facilities to the Senate Athletic Committee. These
recommendations present a sober approach that can
stymie the creation of an elitist athletic system. We
hope the faculty Senate can consider and approve these

' suggestions as soon as possible.

The University could also consider the establishment
of new funding priorities that would funnel more
money to intramurals and recreation. Pitt could learn a
lesson from its arch rival, Penn State, which spent the
money garnered from bowl games on facilities for in-

‘ tramural sports.

BeeGees Not UpiTo Beatles in

[By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
- Directed by Michael Schultz
.Gateway Theater and Showcase Cinemas East

“‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”- is a stringing
_ together of several classical Lennon/McCartney songs from the
popular Beatle album with a paper-thin plot, ﬁguring that by

_ utilizing some big name rock stars the whole thing can be salvaged

asaﬁlm.

__g_» It can't.

‘Producer Robert Stigwood, owner of RSO records (whose

properites include the BeeGees and John Travolta, and who is‘

responsible for “Saturday Night Fever,” “Tommy,” and
“Grease”) takes credit for this moronic excursion.

Storywise, ‘ ‘Pepper’ ’ takes place in Heartland, a wholesome little
community that is equal parts Walton's Mountain and “Mayberry
R.F.D.” Heartland is immune to the corruptions of other cities as
long as the fabled silver instruments once played by the immortal
Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band remain in _City Hall.

Sgt; Pepper and company's claim to greatness was cemented
‘some 50 years before when they stopped a war by marching through
a battleﬁeld, heroically playing the song, “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely
Hearts Club Band.” .

Before the good Sergeant passes on, he hands the legacy on to his

. .' grandson, Billy Shears (Peter Frampton), who, in time, forms his

own Lonely Hearts Club Band with his friends, the Henderson
Brothers (the BeeGees——Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb).
The band is a smash and receives a contract from BD records in
corrupt Los Angeles. They leave Heartland for fame and fortune.
Once Billy and the band are out of the way, a strange force called
FVB, later identified as the Future Villain Band (well-played by
Aerosmith), send out a despicable real "estate agent, Mean Mr.

Mustard (Frankie Howerd) to take over Heartlandand steal the ~

magical instruments.

Billy's girlfriend, Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina), informs the —

Lonely Hearts on what's going on back home. They leave in mid-tour
torlead the search for the magical instruments.

After a series of mishaps, most notably an encounter with a» quack
named Dr. Maxwell Edison (Steve Martin), and after all except one
instrument has been retrieved, everyone settles down to enjoy a
beneﬁt rock concert for Heartland. But while Billy lounges in the
front row, Mustard returns to kidnap Strawberry (for whom he’s
secretly been lusting after) from her popcorn booth. »

The «Lonely Hearts follow in hot pursuit in their trusty balloon,
only to ﬁnd Strawberry being tortured by FVB which plans to turn
her into a mindless groupie. During a massive fight in which the
forces of evil are at long last defeated, Strawberry is accidentally
killed.

Despite the return of the last instrument, Heartland remains

griefstricken. Billy attempts suicide andis rescued in the nick of
time by the town.weathervane which magically comes to life in the
form of Billy Preston. Singing “Get "'Back,”’ he resurrects
Strawberry and restores happiness to Heartland. _., 

The biggest surprise of the film is that Stigwood kept Frampton in
the lead instead of substituting Travolta, who has worked in tandem
with the BeeGees (in some combination—Barry Gibb wrote

the insipid title song for “Grease”) throughout most of his ﬁlm" ’
career——leaving the public to suspect that Stigwood sells them as a ‘

package deal. But at least Stigwood didn't have the nerve’ to hand

' I the part to Andy Gibb.

. At best, Frampton has a pleasant presence on screen, but his light

T-A .. voicegis practically drowned out by the Woody Woodpecker
. -‘back-ups from the BeeGees and though he is easily one of the best

guitarists in-rock, his talentsare lost in the overdone production

Lnumbers-.. .. . v 4

i‘  biggest ﬂaw in the picture, next to making it in the first place,

A was stuffing “'Pepper" with the BeeGees. They’re not amusing as

sidekicks and their shrill voices tend to grate on the nerves. Because
they trill out nearly every number, they obscure the lightness and
delicacy of the Beatle versions and by comparison, tracks from the
Electric Light Orchestra's “Out of the Blue” sound more like they
belong on the “Pepper” soundtrack than the BeeGee cuts.
Finally, the BeeGees simply have no appeal. Barry Gibb has the
physical makings of the handsome hero type-—but his voice is the
shrillest [of the three.
Highlights are few and far between and come from Farina,
(Martin, and Aerosmith.
' Farina, ‘whose voice sounds remarkable like Rita Coolidge, does
clear and lovely renditions of “Here Comes the Sun” and

‘ .-“Strawberry Fields Forever.”

M Martin is suitably loony, mumbling and grabbing his way
—'_,t_h'rough, “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” like that lecherous Tyrone
Johnson used to do on “Laugh
'In.” But he’s funny simply because ‘-43;-tin,
A The single bit of witty casting in ‘ ‘Pepper” also provided the best
’ musical number in the ﬁlm. Aerosmith, with the lead singer Steve
T yler’s strong resemblance to Mick Jagger and the band's excellent

musicianship, provides a gritty realism both musically and visually

that makes for a fine contrast to the ﬂufﬁness of the rest. of the
ﬁlm.

But these moments don't weight much against George Burns’
croaky narration as Heartland’s tedious mayor Mr. Kite, or Alice
Cooper as a Reverend Moon-type psycho.

'Sgt. Pepper’

 

Peter Frampton makes his film debut in “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club

(A Band,” but his vocals are drowned out by the BeeGees. Frampton was signed
_ for the lead two years ago, before the BeeGees got “Saturday Night Fever"
_ and while his own “Show Me the Way” topped the pop charts.

Rare lrishArt Exhibit 

Traces Gaelic Culture

By JEFFREYTWERSKY

The Treasures of Early Irish Art, on exhibit at the.Carnegie Institute of
Art until Sept. 24, is one of rare showings of the national treasures of a
country to tour the United States. It is even more rare for one of these

shows to come to' Pittsburgh,

This show is small in comparison to-the King Tut and Dresden exhibits _

now touring elsewhere in the country but nevertheless contains a few

works of distinction. Consisting ofiapproximately 70 objects, a small _
survey of the‘-‘origins of Ireland is presented.

The collection starts with the Bronze Age, dating around 2000 B.C.,
and progresses through the La Tene, -Early Christian and Hibemo-

Viking periods to the late medieval times of the 14th Century.

In the. selection of objects to exhibit, care was taken to illustrate the
achievements of early Irish civilization in its evolving phases. The gold
ornaments of the Bronze Age are simple and beautiful. The skill in
design and craftsmanship are evident in gold sun disks, lanula
(moon-shaped necklace) and collars. In beauty, these works surpass
much of the later works. A First Century bronze ﬁgure of a boar is

especially noteworthy.

It was, however, in the Golden Age (a.round'the Eighth Century) that

Irish art reached the peak of its magniﬁcence. This period is well _'

‘ represented by the Book of Kells, the Ardagh chalice and the Tara

abstractions of human and animal forms. The Ardagh chalice is‘

Panther Boaters Deadlock Mexicans in Season Opener

By ANNA ARLOTIA
pm New: sun Writer
~ The Pitt soccer team opened up_
its 1978 season Friday night with a
tough 0-0 tie with the visiting
University of Mexico.

Although they were outshot
25-13 by the Mexicans, the
Panthers had. better chances to
score. One of the best Panther goal
opportunities occurred when senior
wing Jedd Zaring broke through

By The Associated Press

The Pittsburhg Steelers, hit hard
by hi humidity and the young

C Seattle Seahawks, sweated out a

21-10 victory yesterday in a

National Football League game.

“It‘s too hot. It‘s too hot to play
football,” said Steeler linebacker
Jack Lambert, whose face dripped
after a game in which he made ﬁve

tackles, seven assists, a pass

interception and a fumble recovery.
“I‘can‘t wait until it gets to lie
about 10 degrees so we can start
running again,” Lambert added.
Hot or not, the third-y@ar
Selhawks kept it close with a
surprisingly tough defense that
was hurt mainly by Steeler
quarterback"Terry Bradshaw, who
shook off an early hand injury and
threw for a pair of touchdowns.
“We scared them last year. But
this year we were more prepared to
beat them,” said Seattle quarter-
back Jim Zorn, recalling a game
here lasrrseason in which the
Steelers broke a 13-13 tie in the
ﬁnal quarter to beat the Seahawks
30-20.
“Seattle‘s offense did a heck of ‘a
job, and defensively~ they showed
what we thought was improve-

ment,” said Steeler Coach Chuck

Noll. “There were parts of the
game where we were physically

_ outp1ayed—outhit. ’ ’

During one third-quarter time
out, the Steeler defenders nearby
all sat on their helmets. The
Seahawks stood.

Lhe defense. Only a brillant save
by the Mexican goalie prevented
the score. Another close call came
when senior wing Craig Connolly
hit the goal post on a shot in the
second half.

The Mexican team took many
long-distance shots, testing Pitt’s
two freshman goalies. Goalie coach
Frank Bucci was pleased with the
performance of the ‘newcomers,
Scott Thunberg and Tom Marshall,

is-Steelers Overheat,  
  Down Seattle, 1-10

“I think we were in better shape
today. They seemed to be a little
out of shape,” said, Zorn.

Regardless of how much the
Steelers puffed, Bradshaw passed
them to victory. 

“We made some progress today,
but we made some mistakes too,”

‘said Bradshaw. “We did some
things you've got to eliminate if
you‘re going to be a championship
football team,. which we‘re not
yet.” '

After bruising his throwing hand
against a Seattle helmet in the ﬁrst
period, Bradshaw stayed in the
game, and wound up with 17
completions in 33 attempts for 213
yards, including two touchdown
‘passes.

With Pittsburgh leading by 14-10
early in the ﬁnal period, Bradshaw
also apparently talked coach Chuck
Noll into a play that led to another
touchdown. ,

Pittsburgh faced fourth down

' and goal at the Seat'tl.e"1’. Noll sent
in place-kicker Roy Gerela. But
Bradshaw called time and ap-
parently helped sell Noll on a
play that led to a 1-yard touchdown
by Franco Harris that secured the
Steelers’ second win in as many
games.

After a scoreless ﬁrst period,
Bradshaw threw two touchdown
passes in the second quarter. They
included a 4-yarder to Lynn Swann
and a 20-yarder to running back Sid
Thornton.

“I thought they .both showed
great promise for the team,” said
Bucci. -“They showed us they.had
confidence in themselves, which
allowed the team-to put conﬁdence
inthem.” .

Thunberg came up with 10 saves
and Marshall had ﬁve.

Rivera Resigns, Fisette Named to Coach Pitt Poloists

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Would a senior on the 1977 Penn
State football team ever be hired
for a position on the 1978 Pitt
coaching staff? What would
happen to the Pitt basketball team
if a Duquesne alumnus were
suddenly named a Panther coach?

In a move not unlike these
hypothetical situations, the athletic
_ department named Jay Fisette to

replace Miguel Rivera as head
water polo coach.

Rivera,,who brought Pitt water
polo from obscurity to national
prominence during his ‘three-year
stint, resigned at the beginning of
the summer, to accept a position at
the new sports medicine facility in
San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Fisette is well known by most of
the present Panthers as a member
of the Bucknell squad that defeated
Pitt in the Eastern ﬁnals last year
in sudden death. It was Fisette
who ‘scored a goal in the ﬁnal
seconds of regulation time, enabl-
ing the Bisons to eventually win
and dethrone the 1976 Eastern
champs.

After controlling Bucknell
through the 1976 season, the
Panthers had no such luck last
year, defeating the Bisons only
once en route to capturing the
Mid-Atlantic Conference champ-
ionship for the third consecutive
year.

Fisette,  years old’, inherits a

team that lost no one to graduation,
but the transfer of Luis Toro and
injuries to Dave Diaz and Steve
Feller will force some shuffling of
the lineup.

Toro, one of the 1977 co-captains
along with Mike Mere, has
returned to his native Puerto Rico
to attend the university there. A
valuable defensive player and the
quarterback of the offense, Toro
will be difﬁcult ot replace, but the
injury to Feller is much more
damaging.

Feller, sometimes spectacular as
a freshman goalie last year,
bruised his heart and four ribs in an
automobile accident this summer
and has been redshirted for the
season.

As a result, Fisette will be forced
to convert one of his co-captains,
Mike Schoﬁeld or George Machi-
cote, to goalie, the player the
rookie coach refers to as “the
most important main in the water.”
Machicote has more experience in
goal, but he is also possibly the.
most vital part of the offense,

‘leading ‘the Panthers in scoring the

last two years.

While Fisette has yet to make a
ﬁnal decision on the matter,
Scholfield sees himself as the
logical choice.

for the position since Machicote is
so valuable to us in the ﬁeld,”_ said
Schofield. “If it’s got to be done,
it’s got to be done, but if I’m going

‘to play goalie, I'll have to improve

1,000 percent.”

The rest of the Pitt lineup as well
as the style of play will remain the
same. Although the style Fisette
played under at Bucknell was
different from the objectives of
Rivera’s method, the Panthers will
not be forced to make any major
adjustments.

“I plan to use the team
strengths,” said Fisette. “Pitt
always handled the ball well,
worked the ball inside to the post-
man and ran plays off him. At

Bucknell, ~the polo players were‘

also ﬁrst-rate swimmers, and I
hope to incorporate -some of that
here.” I 3 -

In addition to Schoﬁeld‘ and
Machicote, Fisette indicated he will
stickwith the lineup that started
most of the games last season,
including all-East performers
Mere, ButchjSilva, Barry Ford and
Papo Ruiz. Three freshman were
added to the roster—Car1os Rod-
riguez, Jose Barea and Scott Alter.

“Carlos adds a new dimension ‘

to the team,” said Fisette.
“He will give us someone that
drives well with the ball and is also
a strong swimmer.” ‘

If the injury to Diaz proves to be
serious, Rodriguez may also sprint
for the ball on face-offs. I

“In a preseason meeting of the
coaches in the Mid-Atlantic Con-
ference, Pitt was picked as the
favorite to repeat as champions,
but that was before Steve’s
injury,” said Fisette. “Coming to
coach an established team like Pitt
will offer a tremendous challenge.
I’m looking forward to it.”

If Fisette conquers the chal-
lenge, Panther water polo fans may
soon forget he '

By The Associated Press

, STATE COLLEGE, Pa.
The way Joe Patemo sees it, his

' Penn State football team is making

too many mistakes on offense and
answering too many questions from
reporters».

“But we’re still 2-0. We're not

"that bad off," quarterback Chuck
. Fusina said Saturday after an

unspectacular 26-10 win over
Rutger Penn State’s last tuneup
before next weekend’s big one at
0hiq_State.

"‘Ifwe do a lotof work this week,

- _ Ithink we’ll be ready for Ohio State
Wand give them a good

game's)‘
Fusina added. ‘ '

The Penn State quarterback
spoke in a relaxed tone. He’s an
amateur magician, and he had a
conﬁdent glint in his eyes, kind of
like a guy who's got something up
his sleeve. '/ _

By contrast, Patemo moved
about the locker room with a facial
expression that could best be
described as a grimace. R

The week before, his much-
ranked third

nationally in preseason, had
escaped witha three-point win over
Temple. '

Against Rutgers, Penn State
once again didn’t play the kind of
offense Patemo expects. ,

The Nittany Lions’ only sus-
tained touchdown drive came in the
ﬁnal period, an 82-yard march that

. ended with a one-yard run by Matt

Suhey.

Four times, Penn State drove to
within 11 yards of the Rutgers’ goal
line, but each time the Nittany
Lions had to settle for a ﬁeld goal
by Matt Bahr. ’ V

The other Penn State scoring
came on a 53-yard touchdown pass
from Fusina to Scott Fitzkee in the
ﬁrst period that helped the Nittany
Lions to a 13-3 halftime lead at
expanded Beaver Stadium, where
the crowd of 77,154 was the largest
ever to see a Penn State home
game. a

‘‘I don't think I’ve ever seen a
Penn State team with so little effort
offensively,” Paterno said from
behind a podium in an interview

Connors Ston/rps Borg ,

By The Associated Press

NEW YORK —Jimmy
Connors, beginning his retribution
against Bjorn Borg, beat the
top-seeded Swede 6-4, 6-2, 6-2
Sunday and regained the U.S. Open
tennis championship, while Chris
Evert won her fourth consecutive
women’s title with a 7-5, 6-4 victory
over 16-year-old Pam Shriver.

Connors, who lost the title to

' Guillermo Vilas last year, jumped in

the air, his arms raised, walked to
the net and affectionately rubbed
Borg’s head .after. the decisive
victory.

The 26-year-old American’s

../.2.‘/:/'

 

triumph spoiled the 22-year-old
Borg’s bid for the Grand Slam.

Borg_,_ his thumb bandaged to
protect a swollen, infected blister,
lost his racquet twice while serving.
It was not immediately known
whether he had played with the aid
of painkillers. He did not ask the
trainer's assistance during the
match. ‘

Evert, 23, became the first
woman since 1935 to capture the
U.S. crown for four straight years.
The last woman to do it was Helen
Jacobs. V

room ﬁlled with reporters.
“We obviously didn’t have
enough zip to get the ball in

, there...As individuals, we may be

playing well, but there's no
cohesion. It's just spotty.” .

If he had been an Ohio State
scout, what message would
Patemo have taken back to Woody
Hayes?

“I’d tell him not to worry-—'-
sleep,” said Patemo.

After the interview with Patemo,
reporters headed for the newly
built players’ dressing room at the
stadium.

As reporters spoke to_ players,
Paterno shouted out a caution to
the Nittany Lions.

“Hey fellows, only talk about
this game. Talk about Temple and
Rutgers and nothing else,”
Patemo directed. “We’ll talk
about next week when we get the
chance.”

Nearby, offensive tackle Keith
Dorney. sat on a folding chair,
surrounded by a dozen reporters.

“In the ﬁrst half, we just weren’t
coming off the ball as hard as we
can,” he said. “But in the second
half, we went out there thinking,
‘Hey, we stink. We've got to go out
and do it.’ And we did it.”

Another throng gathered around
Fusina, whose touchdown pass was

_the 27th of his career, breaking the
‘ old Penn State record of 26 he had

shared with John Hufnagel.

Fusina, who hit 12 of 20 passes
for 173 yards, said he wasn’t
worried about the Penn State
passing game.

“It was a game for the ball
carriers and the line to get their
confidence going. We were more
concerned about the run,” he said.

A reporter mentioned to him that
Patemo had said the Penn State
wasn’t “anywhere near” last year.

“Well, ah, you know, I misseda
few passes,” Fusina said.

“If he says so, he’s probably
right. He knows more than me.”

Defensively, Penn State domin-
ated. -

Late in the second quarter,
Rutgers’ running back Dave Dorn
carried 48 yards on a reverse to the
seven-yard line against a Penn
State defense sprinkled with
reserves. . '

But Patemo rushed starting
tackles Matt Millen and Bruce
Clark and other ﬁrst-stringers back
into play and Rutgers wound’ up
settling for a 36-yard ﬁeld goal by
Kennan Startzell.

The only other Rutgers’ score
came late in the game on a
ﬁve-yard touchdown pass from
backup quarterback Ed McMichael
to backupltight end Andy Carino.

“Our offense didn’t produce as
well as we should, have,”- said
Rutgers’ quarterback Bob Hering,
who spent much of the afternoon
being chased by Millen and Clark.

_ By KAREN KADILAK
""~ Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team is back in
full swing.

Beginning their fall schedule,
the Panthers began practice today
and host Carnegie-Mellon in a
double-header Sunday.

“We’re playing what you would
call a split schedule,” Pitt coach
Bobby Lewis said. “By split, I
mean we’re playing our games
during both the. fall and winter.”

Sunday's double-header at Trees
Field is the ﬁrst of four the
Panthers play in September and
/'3-'ctober. They'll travel to
Carnegie-Mellon for another this

month, before playing Robert
Morris in another home-and-home
set. None of the games count
towards Pitt’s spring record.
“There are many advantages to
fall baseball,” Lewis said. “For

one thing,‘ most ‘of the players have -

been playing for rnostllof the
summer and are ready to continue
playing here at school. It's not like
the spring, when they’ve been

sitting all winter and aren’t in

shape to play ball.

“Then there's the weather,”
Lewis continued. 2 “The weather is
so unpredictable in the spring,
especially in the early part, that we
have had problems playing all our

games.”

Lewis thinks many of the
northeastern colleges will play all
of their games in the fall. ,

“I see spring ball being
eliminated and replaced by a full
fall card,” Lewis said. “The way
the weather-’s been, we have a
better chance to go out in the fall
and play all our games than we do
in the spring.

Lewis sees another advantage.

“Fall baseball gives us a better
chance to pick out talent,” he said.

“You can’t tell too much about a_

player practicing in a gymnasium,
like we do in the _winter when we're
practicing for spring ball. This

scoring after that came on Efren

Late in the ﬁrst period, Steeler
