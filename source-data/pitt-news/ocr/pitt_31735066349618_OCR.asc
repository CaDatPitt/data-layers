Support LowForHigher Ed.

BY LISA RUBEN STEIN

Low priority for higher education
in Pennsylvania is symptomatic of
the lack of interest on the national
level, State Senator Jeanette
Reibman told a group of faculty,
staff and students yesterday.

Reibman, a candidate for U.S.
Senate, and a 20-year veteran of
the Pennsylvania General Assem-
bly, said greater priorities are set
on military might than on educa-
tion.

“Tax reform is fundamental in
bringing down the cost of educa-
,tion," Reibman said. “People are

opposed to more aid for education,
especially those in middle-income
ranges, because they bear the
brunt of tax increases.”
According to Reibman, more
federal aid is necessary for higher
education. “The federal govern-
ment is only putting in 7%, th
state pays about 52%. '
“There should be additional
student aid, so the middle-income

ﬂ family can be eligible for scholar-

ships,” Reibman said.
Reibman is chairman of the
Senate Education Committee, and

past chairman of the House
'Education Committee.

 

Pennsylvania Senator Jeanette Reibman met’ with faculty, staff and
student at an informal gathering in the Faculty Club yesterday-

She said the Student Govern-
ment Board's efforts toward
inﬂuencing individual legislators to
vote for higher state appropriations
for Pitt may not work. “Sometimes
it could work,” Reibman said.
“But no one wants to increase
taxes, even though members of the
legislature don’t want tuition hikes
at state universities.”

Oakland Citizens Strive

To Get Rid

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

Oakland community representa-
tives convened yesterday to discuss
a six-letter dirty word—litter.

“Let‘s face it, the litter problem
in Oakland's business district is a

sproblem to which all of the various

constituencies in Oakland contri-
said Jim Ferlo, South
Oakland Citizen's Council member.

Representatives from the Cham-
ber of Commerce, People's Oak-
land, Pitt, the Oakland News,
Student Government Board (SGB),
Oakland Directions, Inc., Pitts-
burgh Neighborhood Alliance and

 the City Health Department are

pooling resources to help solve
Oakland's litter problem.

Most litter offenses occur outside
Forbes Ave. fast-food establish-
ments. University property and on
or near Belleﬁeld Ave. Six-packs,
pizza boxes and McDonald's
containers appear to comprise
much of the debris strewn
throughout these areas, according
to Jay Roling, Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs and
Chamber of Commerce representa-
tive.

 The group determined a need for

more serious observance of the City

Representatives suggested that
Pitt student leaders, including SGB
and lnterfraternity Council mem-
bers. boost a campus campaign
against littering.

“Cleaning up Oakland is the
responsibility of everyone, stu-
dents. faculty, businessmen and
residents alike,” Slavic depart-
ment lecturer Arcadi Nebolsine
said. ~

The group requested 30 addi-
tional trash cans from file city for
Oakland and received 10, located
mainly on Forbes Ave. and Semple
St.

Assuming the City will provide
no more trash cans for Oakland,
Chamber of Commerce members
are being asked to purchase them.

“Last year the businesses
admitted the need for more trash
cans, but where are they?" asked
Peggy Kutz of the Oakland News.

lsaly's and Sweet Williams,
working within the Chamber of
Commerce, ﬁnanced the printing of
anti-litter posters currently dis-
played by Oakland businesses.

up is scheduled for the first week in
May. Volunteers will be collecting

Mandatory Health Fee

BY CONNIE GIEL

A $48-per-year mandatory health ' E
fee for all full-time students has

been proposed for the fall by the
Ofﬁce of Student Affairs.

Part-time students could pay the
fee on an optional basis.

Those using the Student Health
Service now pay through insurance
or on a fee-for-service basis.

Under the fee, students would be
covered for office visits and
outpatient services such as X-rays
and lab tests. An ofﬁce visit to a
gynecologist, for example, now
costs $15 at Student Health. .

The $48 fee, or $16 per term, is
based upon the assumption of
University ﬁnancial support for the
Student Health Service. '

The University this year funded
$199,092 for Student Health,
$32,035 less than in 1972. The

~ Health Service currently operates,
on a $382,456 budget. Its projected '

budget for 1976-77 is $709,099.

‘Revenue generated by a health,

fee would cover expenses such as
physician and nurse salaries,
supplies and equipment, as well as
health education costs for services
like family, planning. '

If part—time students also -were
assessed the fee, it could be

reduced to $8.50 per term,.

according to Student Affairs
officials.

The full-time graduate and
undergraduate population during
fall term 1974-75 (the most recent
ﬁgures available) was 15,695. A
$16 health fee assessed that
population for two terms, plus the
present University support, would

Starship Damages Cathedral

The top 15 floors of the Cathedral

Injured by phaser attacks were

No speciﬁc reason for the
extraterrestrial attack has been
ascertained, according to acting

Chancellor Cas Myslinski. “It is  

possible, though, the attack was an
attempt to pressure the University
to reconsider its decision not to

Student Support Needed

The Student Government Board (SGB), in conjunction With the

' College Young Democrats (CYD) and College Republicans (CR), has

drafted a letter ur,<zin,‘<.z"l"state legislators to vote for higher
appropriations for Pitt. D115 letter, along with another to parents

I emphasizing their responsibility to pressure the legislature, will be in

the mail by the end of this week.

The CYD and CR members are phoning Western Pennsylvania
legislators, askingthem to comment on the role of. higher education
and to pledge votes for higher education appropriations. SGB also
plans to use the local media to emphasize the University’s need for
more money. -

There also is a student rally planned on April_ 7 to_ show student
opposition tohthe proposed tuition hike. It is encouraging tonote the
Student Coalition Against_Tuition_I-likes may support the April 7 rally.

It is impossible to criticize any of these measures. They are positive,
constructive steps to show the local population, and. more important,
the state legislature,_that_,the,costof a college education, even at a
state’-related school, is becoming unaffordable to many students.

There is a slight gamble in the student rally, and in the efforts to get
students’ parents to write letters to_the,legislators. If few students
show up at the rally, and if only a trickle of letters ever get mailed, then

state legislators can charge. perhaps rightly, that students don't really V

care if there is atuition hike. t

Ifthe anti-tuition campaign is going to be a success, SGB had better
get the students motivated enough to attend the rally. This will be. no
easy task during the last week of school, when students are preparing
for ﬁnals. -

We also are a little frightened by the deia vuexperienced inlooking
qver SGB’s plans. They look too much like last vear’s ill-fated
START-UP day. These plans are good, but we hope this is not the full

extent to'which,.SGB plans to ﬁght the tuition hike. ,

Most academic departments at Pitt have budget committees that are

supposed to be composedpf bothfaculty and students. As far as we I
~ know, no students have taken an active role in these committees. While

iris too late to send student representatives into each department to
lmowledaeablv monitor their budgets, and see if everything that can be
cut is beingcut, we hope the next time someone tries to raise tuition

‘studentswillworkwitheachdepartmenttoensurethecostof
. education at Pitt is as low as possible.

ln_the meantime, we must do everything we can with the methods
readily available. Students and SGB should realize, however, that
letters and phone calls won’t do any good if the studentibody doesn’t
back them up, by attending the planned rally or by vocalizing their
objections to increased tuition. -

We hope they do both.

A Roublev Letter
“Misrepresents"

9: .VThe letter of Michel Roublev
; published in the Pitt News on
March 22 substantially misrepre-

sents the process by which he was
denied tenure. This misrepre-
sentation is probably not’ intention-
al. . Professor Roublev did not
participate in the meetings in

‘'which his tenure was discussed and

he.may have been given incomplete
evidence about them. Neverthe-
less. he suggests in his letter. that
the tenured members of the history
department voted 19-0 to recom-
mend tenure, that Dean Rosenberg

‘refused to accept this unanimous

vote and must, therefore, have
been motivated by political rather
than scholarly considerations. The

' In..the spring of 1975, . after
careful consideration of professor
Roublev’s professional attain-
ments, the tenured members of the

to one majority to deny tenure.

However,-‘ Professor Roublev was A

 

urged at that time .to obtain

external evaluation of his work and

to revise his manuscript book so
that his case could be reconsidered
in the fall. Professor Roublev
complied and his case was

members of the history department
believed_ Professor Roublev's pro-
fessional attainments were not
such that they could support a
recommendation for tenure, but
they did agree to sign a report
which would outline both the
strengths and weakenesses cf
professor Roublev's professional
skills and accomplishments.

Unfortunately departmental proce-
dures became confused at this

point—some persons thought .they _

had signed an unqualiﬁed recom-
mendation for tenure while others
believed they had signed a
qualiﬁed recommendation for ten-
ure. Still others felt they had only
signed a descriptive report.

Confusion here came from within
the history department and not
from Dean .Rosenberg. '

Smile, You’re on Photo-Scan

BY TOM WASELESKI

It took me a while, but now I
can stand being on Photo-Scan
whenever I go to the supermarket.
I’ve got nothing against the
perverted sense of humor exhibited
by amateur J. Edgar Hoovers, and
as a matter of fact, I get a wealth of
satisfaction from knowing I’m the
source of one man’s pleasure. It’s
kind of like a /thing between
consenting adults.

.“Smile, you’re on Photo-scan,”
the sign reads as you enter,
borrowing a little of the sardonic
from [Allen Funt. Then you see
them hovering over peas and diet
cola, over dog food and cheese
spread; those gray cameras, the
ultimate in instant news. You
wonder what they do with the miles
of ﬁlm footage that come out of
there showing people tip-toeing for
cans, stooping for milk and
throwing over-priced items back.

l’d suspect it's very possible they

splice together clips of women

reaching down’ for Oreos and men

4 reaching up for sardines, resulting‘ ‘

in a sort of grocery porn, devoid of
panting.

And then there’s the ominous‘
hemisphere suspended from the

 

actions in the Roublev case must
therefore take into account both

this confusion and.the 10-9-4 vote ,

recommending tenure.

This letter was signed by 10 history
faculty. \ - - .

A Unite Behind
Basic Ideas

To Mr. Kalman’s article in the
March 31 Pitt News, I would like to
express my feelings. First of all,
rot to mislead anybody, I am a
member of a fraternity and
secretary of I.F.C. The article went
around the major argument against
SCATH by IFC. That is what can be
effectively accomplished by
SCATH and students.

Statements about changing “a
class struggle", “the University
Board of Trustees", and the like
are missing the point. Any student
organization that expects to mobil-
ize students with ideas and

statements as such, with ﬁnals,

ceiling with its very blinkers

almost forbidding you to stare at it

for very long, as if it offered a view

of the Inferno or perhaps _a glimpse‘

into your soul’s darkest corner. I
suppose if I were seven or eight I’d
fantasize that it was the computer
mastermind of" the entire market,
meaning that a bullet through one
of its throbbing lights would cause
the building’s electrical system to
short-circuit, its shelves to col-
lapse, its cash registers to explode
and its shopping carts to speed
madly all over Oakland. ‘

HVIPRESSIONS

As l’ve said, -Photo-Scan doesn’t

, bother me as much as it used to.

One of the beneﬁts has been a
better understanding of Orwell’s
1984.

What is enough to make a person

- want to suspend his patronization

of an Oakland stor_e, though," is
when people, rather. than ma-
chines, do the snooping. Either
from a raised perch where
prescriptions are made, or just
from the front of the store, this
town has several notorious Shy-

A locks who are more interested in

your stealing than your buying.

Some go so far as to tail you,
despite the fact that there are only
two aisles in the entire store.
They'll fake dusting the toothpaste

' display or counting the combs on a

display tree, playing ring around

the sales rack with you because
they’ve got nothing else to do, and.
after all, you’re just a student, a
black or one of Oakland’s poor.
They can’t afford carnival mirrors
to hang‘ up in the corner, so they
bring in a grouchy old woman *3
man who’s probably a bastard 
grandfather to some tormented kid,
and let them roam the aisles like
hired German shepherds.

. The day you give them the
beneﬁt of a doubt you’ll pick up a
package of body powder from a
shelf in the center aisle and see in
the hole you've left the cold, gray
eye of a short yet brutal-looking
man who is the owner or part of the
family interest; .

What you do then is put the -
powder back on the shelf or, bﬁ;

yet, in Shylock’s grubby hands,
and leave.

‘It’s one thing to be caught by the
indiscriminating eye of a camera,
but it's quite another to be
scrutinized as if you were a walking
wanted poster. i ‘

Not all of Oakland’s merchants
are so blatant in monitoring their
inventory; if they were, this
wouldn’t be so much of an urban
campus as it" would be a market
place right out of Shakespeare.

Some proprietors howev 
would choose to forget who H
feeding whom."

coming, as well as the end of
school, is welcome to do so. This, I
guarantee you, though, will result
in failure of the fight against tuition
hikes.

Therefore, we come‘ to the
problem of what can be done inthe
short time remaining to organize
students to stop or minimize tuition‘
hikes as much as possible. First, to
draw media and public attention to
the problem, we must mobilize and
have a show of strength by
students backing three basic
premises—that ‘tuition hikes will
result in reduction of quality
education. that many students will

have to quit or postpone their plans_ ‘ John D. Powers

will present hardships to cu x

parents and faculty in providing

attention will occur and be directed

‘to legislators (due for re-election)

against aid increases by a large
turnout of students at the upcom-
ing rally (April 7th).

I like our members, feel this is
what we as students can effectively
accomplish toward our aims in the

Arabs In Israel Not Equal

‘:5; BY BILL KALMAN
I A while back I wrote a column on
the UN resolution condemning

Zionism as a form of racism. I
demonstrated that Arabs living in
Israel are systematically harassed,
victimized and discriminated
against. Zionism, I argued, is not in
the interests of the Jewish people.
Several Zionists responded to my
article, claiming I lied and distorted
the facts. Arabs in Israel are not
oppressed, they stated. Again,

let's examine the facts, and see
who the real distorters are.

—-Arabs in Israel suffer discrim-
ination in education. According to
the Israeli Government Yearbook,
94% of Jewish school-age children
attend school. while only 61% of
eligible Arab children do. This
disparity increases in higher
education, where, until recently,
Arabs weren’t admitted to most
Israeli universities.

—-Arabs in Israel own less than
one-ﬁfth of the country's land.
Beginning in the 1930s, Arabs were
driven front their land and villages
to make room for the immigrating
European Jews. This process was
accelerated in the 1947-48 period.

—A series of laws passed
between 1948 and 1958 made it
impossible for Arabs who had ﬂed
the fighting to retain their land.
These laws also made it difficult for
those who did not ﬂee to keep the
land they still possess (the
infamous Law of Limitations).

—Arabs in Israel were unable
to join Histradrut, the Israeli trade
union, on an equal basis with Jews
until 1959. Even today, most Arabs
arejnot members of trade-unions,
since they are forced into mining,
service occupations ‘and agricul-
ture, where they farm the least
productive lands. Because of
Jewish supremacy in Israel, this
situation has not fundamentally

changed since 1959. .

—Arabs in Israel also are subject
to restriction on their political
activity. For example, when the El
Ard Movement attempted to
organize around a program of Arab
equality in 1964 (to be obtained by
legal and peacpful methods), their
application was rejected as a threat
to the existence of the State of
Israel. In fact, the Emergency
Regulations, which were passed in
1948, still are used today to hold
thousands to Israeli Arabs under
“administrative detention,” with-

   

out charging them for any crime. -

There are but a few documented
facts which prove that Arabs living
in Israel, far from being treated as
equals, are a dispossessed people
denied educational, economic and
political equality by a, government
based on Jewish supremacy. _

Several days ago, CBS News did
a feature on the plight of Israeli
Arabs. The reporter concluded the

The

   Pitt Tenants

'1' ?"Are Unhappy

  The Eitt. News, in the article
: ; “‘Pitt Building Tenants Complain,”

has presentedan unfair picture on

_I. the.issues which the. tenants of the
-Oakwood‘ and Franklin apartment

complexes are faced withv.-;:;. Bill
Moore, author of- the article, has
presented. serious issues and
problems simplistically and follow-

 ed these by University rebuttal,

leaving the impression that-the
' issues were without substance.

The .magnitude-of the issues and

the facts surrounding the issues

I‘ , were not presented. The Tenant

Organizing Committee, an organi-
of the

feel our plight must be made
known to the University and
residentiaLcommunities.

The residents of the University-
owned apartment buildings.. are
daily-faced with abhorrent living
conditions.- Tenants live with

’ tr'i'edi‘to'.tape back up;

plaster falling from ceilings. and
walls; wallpaper is peeling off the
walls,”'Whlch some -tenants have
sewers
back-up" into the basements and
sometimes into the apartments; the
steam_heating system leaks and by
so doing is rotting the floors; the
pipes of the heating system bang
and clang and vibrate. so badly that
a full night’s sleep is impossible,
not to mention that the heating
system cannot be controlled——we
have total heat (95 degrees F on the
third floor) or no heat at all. The
above are.just a sample. We could
add broken windows, electrical
outlets hanging off .walls, poor
wiring, poorly functioning appli-
ances, and no building security.

The University’s plans for these
buildings are simply windowdres-
sing. The University has not
spoken to any speciﬁc problems the
tenants are forced to live with.
Some plans Pitt has proposed are
directly opposed by the tenants of
the building, .who consider the
plans unrealistic_or possibly dama-
ging. All.the University plans.have
been designed unilaterally without
the consultation of the tenants or

the community. Pltt had previous-
ly pledged joint planning with the
community on issues concerning
the Oakland area.

The tenants of the University
buildings, as members of the
University community and taxpay-
ers, are concerned over the
extravagant plans for -exterior
beautification. which would not
allelviate existing interior problems
andlwould be a tremendous waste
of public monies. At a time when
the University is asking for tuition
hikes, it wants tovwaste money on
pedestrian parks, where parking
facilities . used to be, artiﬁcial

balconies. and window awnings for

old buildings. Furthermore, Pitt is
losing money by allowing residen-
tial buildings, which they purchas-
ed, to be boarded up and sit rotting
until they are uninhabitable, and

_ which

chaining up parking lots.which had '

been previously leased but are now

 

' empty lots.

The University wishes to project
an image of morality and honesty in
its dealings. The University wants
to be seen as. an upstanding
institution providing services. The
image the University projects to its
tenants is one of an unfeeling,
indifferent realtor. Pitt has
increased rents tremendously,
without increasing services, over
the last four years, and without
regard for its students or the
retired long term and
instances crippled tenants. The
University forced a general in-
crease in Oakland rents, through
rapid expansion of the student
population, thus causing an imba-
lanced supply and demand situa-
tion for housing. This supply and
demans had led to inﬂated rents,
the University is now
reaping the beneﬁts from. The
University should take the respon-
sibility to act as a force to lower
area rents.

The University has stated that its
expansion .is over. According to an
Oakland businessman, the Univer-

sity has offered to buy his property. >

University To Level Oakland

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The University Board of Trustees
has announced that a 20-year-old
plan to level the remainder of
Oakland and roof Schenley Park’s
Panther Hollow will proceed in the
next few months following receipt
_of Federal grants for the project.

The plan, according to one
University source, was held.up for
20 years because of the refusal" of
an elderly Oakland woman to
surrender her. home to the
University Treasurer's office.

_The elderly woman,. who lived
with;nearly fifty cats of all shapes
and colors in ahome bordering the
Schenley Park area, was recently
committed to Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic against her
will__ .

According to the source, there
may be a connection between the
subsequent disappearance of_.the
old 1ady’spets and the Uniyersity’s
recent air-pollution hearing con-

“At any rate,” the source said
nervously, “plans are going ahead
now to build a.multi-million dollar
complex including an’ underground
city in what is now called the
Hollow.”

control most- of the property in

It isnot known what the reaction
of Oakland residents might be, but
there are rumors that ROTC
students, spurred by the promise of
CAS credits for.. military. studies,
are suiting up in preparations to
quell any disturbances.

the University has _ promised to

police and fire protection in order
to balance the decrease of taxable

said, baring a feckless grin.

The plan for, an underground.city
in Schenley Park’s Hollowwas first
proposed by former Pitt Chancellor
Edward Litchﬁeld. '

The Litchfield -plan included
restaurants, bubbling brooks, trees
and audioanirnitronic squirrels, as
well as a nuclear furnace and the
world’s largest indoor navy. The

plan fell through when one‘
_designer lost ‘th,e-master blue-

prints. In the confusion the backers
lost interest and went to South

America to overthrow a 'govern- ‘

ment.

. Current plans for_the sub-surface
city follow the Litchfield project
closely, except the indoor navy.has

for Americans to experience

seen as representatives of the-U.S.
who are giving others a chance to
meet Americans.

‘.‘It’s a common experience of
volunteers that the ﬁrst months are
the most difficult. lt’s .a period of
adjustment,” Lyons said. “People
don’t know you, but know you're
different. They tend to be cautious
in letting you become involved in
community activities. They’re.pol-
ite, but politeness is different from
acceptance.”

‘Then you’ll have to get rid of me.’
They replied ‘Oh no, you’re not
white anymore.’ ”

Most volunteers, Lyons claims,
ﬁnd they get a lot more out of their
jobs, both professionally. and
personally, than they put into
them.

“It's hard to see what contribu-
tions you make when you’re only

" There's one good joke, any-

way, in And What Were They
Going To Do With The Holy Grail
vWhen They Found It, Mr. Rossetti?

A scruffy newsboy (Chris Blaetz)

repeatedly enters the auditorium
and dumps hundreds of newspa-
pers. They spill over the playing
area and nuzzle the audience.

There’s. no doubt about it—it’s the
high point of the evening. And I’ll
be honest:
you’ll love this play.

\

Comedy Skids On Newspaper

Laboratory Theatre’s production of
And-Wha.t Were They Going To
Do, conceiyed and.directed by Bill
Royston, is not much worse than
could reasonably be ' expected. '
David.Crawford plays .a [man who
is-—you guessed—an obsessive
newspaper reader; Kate Nicholas is
his demented wife.

The two—we are asked .to
believe—have not spoken to each
other for 18 years. The sudden
spasm of mutualrecognition, which
apparently provides the excuse for
this miserable enterprise, consists
almost entirely of the unappealing
twosome reading extracts suppos-
edly gleaned from copies of. The
Pittsburgh Press they use (wisely)

to screen their faces and preserve‘

their anonymity.

Crawford and Nicholas, who
manage to stoop to the occasion,
say what they have to say and skid
on newspapers. I have a sneaking
suspicion that with a play as bad as
this an apparently execrable
performance may be. the noblest
form of.parody. If this is the case,
then Nicholas, who—among other
accomplishments—conviIfcingly-

-- gives the impression that crying

involves nothing but making aloud
noise, may well be a genius of the
stage.

Toward the end of the evening,
the devastating boredom.of having
to listen to.a dialogue_consisting
almost entirely of disembodied
facts is broken by Auntie Jane
(Trish Begly), who stands on a
bench—the one prop (besides, of
course, the newspapers)—and
answers rather. pointless questions
with neither wit nor style. She uses
what I assume is meant to be a
funny voice. It is not. _

‘And .What Were They .Going To
Do concludes with the wife insane
on a pile of newspapers and .the
maid (Ramona _Fischer) deciding,
with great righteousness, to
“improve her mind” by reading-
yes——a newspaper.

As Mr. Rossetti would have said
in that droll old way of his, ‘ ‘It must
mean something.”

[Glitters  

On Operatic Stage

BY PAMELA EUSI

A quintet. of master musicians
made last night's opera at Heinz
Hall superb entertainment for
those who ventured out_into the
stormy weather. The ﬁve leads
capitalized on their singing talents
and dramatic. abilities in a
memorable performance.

With.r_nusic by Giuseppe Verdi
and lyrics by Antonio Somma, Un
Ballo in Maschera [A Masked Ball]
proved to be a work full of diversity
and strong in stage action.
Another feather in the Pittsburgh
Opera’s cap proved to be the return
of general director Richard Karp to
the conductor’s platform after a
long battle with illness.

' Most operas spotlight maybe one
or.two leads but Ballo contained an
incredible amount of balance. The
“male lead,” Riccardo, was played
by Francisco Lazaro. His strong
tenor voice was complemented by
ever-present," always-ready and
willing soprano lead Amelia Gilda
Cruz:Romo. Her great vocal range
and ﬁne acting made the show.
Amelia’s husband Renaldo (Mario
Sereni) played the third part of the
triangle, and, though his voice
literally knew no bounds, his .style
was stilted and cramped. Acting is
not one .of his finer points.

A delightful role that adds to the
lightness of the opera is Oscar, a
page, and Carol. Wilcox kept
everyone ..entertained with her
cleyer antics and soaring soprano
voice. The last member of the

quintet was the sorceress, Ulrica .

played by Frances Bible. No
stranger to the operatic -stage, she
put on a “bewitching” act that kept
both cast and audience spellbound
with rich mezzo soprano vocals and
life-like special effects.

Staging left a lot to be
desired—the menacing.
made its presence felt ad inﬁnitum.
It really isn’t necessary to have an

insipid background with a lot. of '

clumsy, "uncomfortable-looking
people ‘standing around. They
could at least be doing something
useful. For the first time this
season, the chorus looked and
acted (poorly.

Scene 2 of Act IV transformed
bad into worse as the chorus tried
to dance. And when some of the
members had to strip off their
masks to dance, theyalmost ripped
off their powdered wigs. That was

the only scene where the chorus
served a real purpose, and they
blew it.

Lighting and sets createdquite a
mood for the show. They kept the
lighter numbers cheery and the
A grand
depth effect was achieved in the
enormous . scenes painted on
backdrop curtains. ‘

The. story is. in some cases- 

historically accurate, patterned
after the assassination of King
Gustavus III of Sweden at a
masquerade ball on March..16,
1792. (The title .was especially
appropriate for this April Fools’
Day.) The story has the king,
Riccardo loved by a1l——except for a
pair of sneaky, stereotyped cour-
tiers who are conspiring to kill him.
The ‘king’s best man,. Renaldo,
warns him of an assassination plot
but Riccardo won’t.be1ieve it. The
king decides to investigate the
accuracy of an old witch’s
prophesies before he banishes her
from Sweden. She predicts he wiy

die. soon and at Renaldo’s hands \‘

Riccardo laughs it off and
overheats the witch aiding his
secret love, Amelia (Renaldo’s
wife). He follows her and they
express their mutual admiration in
a stirring love duet.

When the pair is caught by
Renaldo, who is coming to warn the
king of the pending plot, Amelia
veils her face. Riccardo entrusts
Amelia to Renaldo and when the
killers arrive they disappointedly
ﬁnd»Renaldo. Soon, by a slight slip

  

of the veil, Renaldo finds his wiffi:§
has betrayed him and decides to — =

join the conspirators. He almost
kills Amelia, but finally spares her,
and he then plans to do the king in.
Oscar enters the ball at the king's
inyitation and they decide that that
will be the sceen of the crime.

After much singing and dancing
at the ball, Oscar tells Renaldo
which disguise the.king is wearing,
and the fatal shot rings out, but not
after Riccardo sings a tender

goodbye to the tearful Amelia. (I -

could hardly keep from laughing

-during this .scene, as the .parody it‘

Lewis..Another Schenley Sullerstar 

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

Sonny Lewis; the name sounds
athletic, like one destined for
stardom. It conjures up images of
anethlete who. relies on speed and
agility. And in case you haven’t
heard, it’s also the. name of Pitt's
latest basketball recruit.

Lewis’ signing has. transformed
Coach Grgurich’s recruiting season
from outstanding to phenomenaL
The type of ballplayer who could ﬁt
into any program, Lewis agrees he
has a place in Pitt's lineup.

1‘l think I would ﬁt in ﬁne as the
second guard,’? he said. “Our
increased board strength will

 

enable the guards to shoot more,
and I think my. quickness and
jumping. ability wilL enable.me to
stop a six-three or SlX:f0l11' guard.”

If that sounds like a -pretty
optimistic assessment, Lewis is, in
fact, being modest. The Schenley
senior averaged 22 points per game
this past season and rumor has it
he can resthis elbows on the rim of
the basket.

Pitt, however, almost lost out on
signing Lewis, since playing in
North Carolina (at either North
Carolina or N- C. State) was his
original intention. But fortunately
for Pitt basketball, neither school
contacted him.

Flenory, Coach,
Go To Dwluesne

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor
Did you know that half of the ambulance drivers in the City of
Pittsburgh. are also funeral home employes?
Does.this suggest a conﬂicf of interest? A

Think so? Well, how about this.
Association (NCAA) has some pretty strict guidelines about
recruitment of athletes _by colleges and universities.

The Na.tional.Collegiate Athletic

the

They include restrict.ions-on visitation privileges, administration of

ﬁnancial assistance, etc, etc.

It was announced yesterday that all-state guard Baron “BB”
Flenory.has signed a letter-of-intent to play basketball for Duquesne

University next season.

— The signing, not totally unexpected, comes on the heels of the

' resignation of Duquesne assistant basketball coach Jim. Sims.

This, of course, leaves a vacancy on.the.Duquesne coaching staff. A
likely candidate has emerged, and .if his appointment is conﬁrmed
today, the day after the Flenory signing, that too will be of little

surprise. 4

v Valley High coach Mike Rice has made it known that he would be '

Rice is a former

Duquesne star, and a -return to his alma mater wouldn’t be all that

unlikely. .

Now, for.the important clue. Mike Rice was Flenory’s high school ‘
coach. Is Rice making.the move to Duquesne for Flenory’s beneﬁt? Is
Flenory playing for Duquesne next season to help secure his former
coach a. shot at major college basketball?

‘the- time being,

, Is thisa conflict of interest? Perhaps it’s just a ﬁg newton of my-
- imagination, but deﬁnitely food for thought.‘ A
AND HERE’S A SURPRISE...The National Basketball’ Rules
Committee .has decided to bring the “dunk” back into amateur
basketball after a decade-long ban. As the rule has been written, the
‘dunk .will be allowed only during the game, and not-during pre-game
warmups, or during intermission. ' . A -
With practically everyone on a major-college basketball team ableto
perform such a feat, it deﬁnitely will make the game more interesting.
The homerun of basketball ﬁnally has returned.

The committee also decided to make any technical foul called on the ‘

team bench a mandatory two-shot foul. This wouldjnhibit coaches who
might deliberately draw technical fouls to get their teams stirred up.

THERE ISA HIGH SCHOOL senior.from Georgia, Leavon Mercer,:
whose statistics are a noteworthy 30 points and 30 rebounds per game.
Thirty points per game is not so remarkable.in high school basketball,
but to average 30 rebounds a game, anywhere, is extraordinary.

To make a long_stor_y short, Mercer was.all signed, sealed and

delivered to the University of Georgia. That is,_.until yesterday, when

Mercer reportedly called the Pitt basketball ofﬁce, and “expressed an
interest.in the Pittprogram.” - . V

“I would watch them on TV,”
Lewis . related, “and I thought I
could ﬁt into their style of play.”

The decision to attend Pitt came
March 24, Lewis’ birthday and the
day Schenley lost to Farrell in the
PIAA Western semi-ﬁnals. Lewis
believedhe would feel more at ease
by staying in Pittsburgh, and he i
also felt his mother would be happy
with that decision. .And, of course,
a man named Grgurich had more
than .a little to do with Lewis’
decision to stay in Pittsburgh.

‘:1 would go over to Pitt and we
talked a lot,” -Lewis- said. “Not
necessarily about me coming there,
but about howto better myself. He

just seemed like a wonderful guy.”

Another pleasant extra awaiting
Lewis at. Pitt is the presence of
former Schenley teammates Kelvin
Smith and Wayne Williams. But
Smith.and Williams never convin-
ced.him'to come to Pitt and Lewis
quickly adds, “I’m going to play for
myself.” . ~ , L

Academics, an area. which
troubles many athletes, -is some-
thing Lewis takes. seriously. and
says he is prepared for, by virtue. of
being a B-plus student in high
school. His main interest is
business. ‘

“I have no problems about going
to school. If I don't go.to the pros, I
want. something to fall baclc on
(business). I like math and I think I
could_talk to people and sell a
product.”

Like most ballplayers,‘ Lewis’
eventual goal is the pros, and he
admits he could leave..college early
if the situation. was right. But for
Lewis’s main
concerns are the basketbalL»pro.-
gram at Pitt, its possibilities of
success and- where he- may
eventually ﬁt into that success.

- Like.a few others, he considers the

outside. possibility of a national
championship. .

“I cansee it,” he said. “We're
really going to have to get to. know
each other. We could take it next
year if we get adjusted early
enough.”

’ .Lewis has a realistic outlook on -
' his stature as both a freshman and

lntramurals--Pitt’s Other Sports Program 

, BY STEVE SYBERT '
Associate Sports Editor

Withthe end of the Winter.Term
approaching, it’s timeto. look back
at .Pitt’s “other” athletic program
—intramurals.

Results are in for basketball,
raquetball, volleyball and indoor
soccer.‘

The most important event is
Philadelphia’s Schlitz Extramural’
Basketball Tournament, in which
Pitt. will be represented by the

~   ° 

season ever.

a possible starter on next season's
team.

‘‘I’m not really looking to start,”
Lewis said, “But I can start if I go
up and play the type of basketball I
can play. I'm sure I'll be seeing
plenty of playing time-”

Lewis also has anticipated where
adjustments must be made in his
style of play.

“Pitt is a more patterned type of
offense,” he said. “Here (at
Schenley) it was geared to
individual moves.?’ ‘

Now that his high-school career
is.ﬁnished, Lewis can reﬂect on.his
highs andlows over the past few
years. His best game, he says, was
at Hershey last year for the state
championship; his worst, the loss
to Farrel this year.

According to Lewis, -when you
are state.champion, .you .play for
pride. But he obviously feels his
team was not given a fair shake in
this ‘year's WPIAL tournament,
and -is not afraid to voice his
opinion.

“If the refs call it fair, Fifth,

(the WPIAL title) every year. Butii‘
they don’t want us in the WPIAL.’

Lewis has other memories too,
like how his brother Jeep Kelly,j’
used to eat up Pitt basketball
players in one-on-one games at t_he';7
Field House a few years back. "He:
also remembers how his brother:
went to play college ball at Lasﬁ
Vegas, Nevada—and became very "_
disappointed.'_But that is.not what i
deterred Lewis from going to
equally-distant school. ’ pg L"

Lewis said-. “Maybe I could have"?

Sonny Lewis probably could havi
gotten along anywhere. At least,
that’s how he comes across. , And  ,

‘assistant athletic director.

 “I think it’s been a tremendous
year,” Bullman said. “They’ve all
done well.”  ' '

there were five competitive sports
for women—basketball, volleyball,
swimming, tennis, and gymnastics.
.,Last year, she added a track team
to bring the total to six. Next fall,
the program will expand to include
field hockey, and Bullman is
hopeful of starting a softball team

in the near future.

, “We’re growing,” Bullman
said. “At times you wonder if. it’s
- growing too fast, but I feel we're
"keeping a good pace. We want to
‘strengthen the sports program
we've already got ' before we
expand.”

Rain Answer To Pitt

Tennis Team’s Prayer

BY JIM LEWIS

If you were standing in the rain
and cold at the Trees Hall tennis
Courts yesterday, anxiously await-
ing the start of the Pitt and
Carnegie-Mellon tennis match, you
were in for a surprise.

There wasn’t one.

The Panther-Tartan match was
cancelled due to inclement weather
and was rescheduled for Tuesday,
April 6 at 2 p.m.—whichj for Pitt is
good news.

Why is it good news? Because
now, the week delay will give Joe
Sakalik, the Panthers’ number-one
player, a chance to rest the strained
ligaments in his right foot.

He won’t be able to rest long,
however, because the Panthers will.
visit the Alpine Arena to take on
host Duquesne today and then
return to the Trees Hall Courts
Saturday at 2 p.m. to entertain
California State (of Pa.). And the
way things look, he will probably
see action in both matches.

“He’s expected to play,” con-
ﬁrmed team captain Mike Habbel.

“He’ll try to play in at least one‘

event today and . hopes, to play
Saturday.”

Sakalik will be sorely missed if
he is unable to perform either today
or tomorrow. California-St. is a
strong team while Duquesne could
hold a few surprises.

But it’s not likely. ’

“D/uquesne has a 'fair number-

one player,” Habbel said, “but not
much more.”

Which means Pitt’s record could
inﬂate to 3-0 before the weekend is
over. That is, if Sakalik recovers in
time. '

If not, the pressure could be on
Habbel, Pitt’s number-two star,
and teammates Harry Habbel,
Dave Wulkan, Gary Mosso, Lou
Miller and Tom Gault (Sakalik’s
doubles partner) to play extra-well
to make up for Sakalik’s absence.

Last Tuesday, the Panthers were
hampered by Sakalik’s injury,
falling behind Grove City 1-0 after
the number-one singles match,
before roaring back to overcome
the Wolverines, 8-1, to post their
current 1-0 season mark.

If they plan to take two this
weekend, it looks like they’ll have
to do more of the same. I
