.More Than Daneers

The Appointments Committee of Student

Congress has placed a call. for applicants for
committee heads of the major dances of the
year. Janet Neesham, as chairman of the com-
_mittee, hopes-that all worthy persons who
"might be interested in a dance project-the
Junior Prom,ithe freshman dance, and the
Spring Festival Ball———apply immediately.

Pitt has needed a revival of high class danc-
ing aifairs. To long, Pitt social life has dragged
through inefﬁcient handling, lackof imagina-
tion, and a general apathy towards “College,
Joe ”‘ activities. P

If the Harvest Moon Hop is any indication,

- We,are out of the doldrums, and the Pitt waltz-

ers will have something to look forward to
for the rest of the year.

But dances are more than tickets. They
mean Work in arrangements, personnel, money
handling. In all, they provide excellent ex-
perience for the interested student. For the
committee heads and members, they mean long
hard hours during a short period of time. In
‘this respect, they are -diﬁerent from the other
school activities. Once the job is ﬁnished, the
-date of.tl1e dance is past, little work remains.

It is. worth a try for any student who feels
that he may want experience iri actual pro-
ject Work. The offices of the deansof men and
women hold application blanks. And deadlines
for appointments are soon.

Houses To Burn

, Like the weather, everybody is talking
aboutthe housing problem. Radio comedians
make corny jokes about it, taxpayers send‘ tele-
grams to their congressmen about it, crusading
newspapers run editorials about it. True to
form, nobody is doing much of anything about
it. -

Unlike the Weather, ‘there is something that
can be done.  -

Wil1iam,F. Saalbach, assistant to the dean
of men and director of the University housing
bureau said, “ We would liketo remind the
male students that We have this service avail-
able to them.”

. It its ﬁles, the Pitt housing bureau has list-
.1ngs of all sorts of living accomodations for
single men, many available immediately. Apart-
ments for married students are still rather
scarce. .

Over half of these facilities are locate_d in
the Oakland district, many within walking dis-
tance of the University.

_ Through the cooperation of the city of
Pittsburgh housing bureau, veteran and non-
veteran students have been able to get hous-
«mg, three to six room apartments. In addition,
the county has housing for veterans only.
V ‘ Opportunities like these should not be "wast-
ed. With housing conditions as tight as they
are» there should be more reaction to’ the~bu-

Editor, The Pitt News
I do .not believe that a goo

most objective of the university. Conversely’, ,[ do not» believe
that a university must ‘maintain a poor football team. in order
to achieve a‘ high scholastic rat-. “

are usually incorrect ” in their
opinions, and therefore, I think
that there is a. medium course of
actiongopen to the oﬂicials at Pitt.

As far as I can ascertain,[the
student body at Pitt desire “a
good football team, and that is,
understandable, since any student
desires to be proud of his Uni-
versity. It seems reasonable to as-
sume, then, that the Alumniwould
also desire that the University,
have a football team of which‘
they can be proud.’

Therefore, ‘I can see no reason

Scott has forgotten his quintette and that»music.'

the men as they come in to ac-

Upperclassmen will not be no-

Probers Move Slowly
Congress Seeks
Incentive System  

.- By Mike Levine s
“Why don’t we get the players that our opponents do?” Student

The athletic probe committee of Congress is continuing'its search
for the answer to this question but as yet has made little headway.
A proposed meeting with the faculty committee on athletics so "far -

Spokesmen at Tuesday’s meeting of Congress expressed concern

over thegfact that their attitude
generally hasbeen considered as
critical of the team and coaching

staff. In a concise statement of‘

policy, George Lynn, president of
Congress, said they want to ﬁnd
out exactly why Pitt does not
have a system providing incen-
tive to high school athletes to give
the school teams strength com-
parable to its opponents. He em-
phasized, “At no time did Con-
gress intend to knock the players
or any or the coaches.

A meeting with the faculty
committee on athletics has been
attempted but so far negotiations

have failed. The faculty, group

will not be able to mee the stu-
dent group until late next week.
At their meeting Wednesday, too
many items were brought before
the athletic _ committee to allow
time for interview of the probe
group.

Chancellor Fitzgerald has ex-
pressed a desire to have the Con-
gress members meet with the fac-
ulty board soon, but Dr. Richard
E. Sherrill, chairman of the board
told the meeting of Student Con-
gress that this would not be pos-
sible until at least Thursday.of
next week. V

In speaking of the chancellor,
Franklin Blackstone, president of
Interfraternity Council and junior
representative to Student Con-
gress said, “Frankly, I feel he has
done all he can to help the situa-
tion.”

When ﬁrst queried about Pitt
athletic policy, Dr. Sherrill sug-
gested the inquiry wait‘unti1 af-
ter the end of the football season.
Student Congress, however, ini-
tiated the formal investigation and
in spite of slow progress is deter-
mined to get a suitable answer for
the student body.

Contrary to reports from down-
town papers, the action taken

thus far by the students has not ‘

reached the magnitude of a “re-
volt” or even a smear campaign.

Said Bill Veenis, member of
Congress and editor of the News,
“Nobody is to be cruciﬁed or put
on the spot, but Congress does
have a ﬁrm determination to
make its investigation and report
its ﬁndings to the students.”

Are you sure you are not a statistical probability‘? Out of every
1000 people examined 10 have tuberculosis! These are the figures
quoted by the Public Health Service.

As an aid in rooting out and checking this disease the Public
Health Service will oﬁer free X-rays at Pitt from Nov. 3 to 15.

From 9:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. X-ray units capable of taking

three pictures a minute wil oper

ate somewhere on the first ﬂoor.

The exact location will be announced later in the News.
If thereis suffici.ent interest from the night, school, units also will
function Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings.

In the event that some of the‘
students can not be handled in the
allotted time the units will re-
main over long enough to com-
plete the job. ,

The present project has had
favorable results in past years
catching unsuspected cases in the
early’ stages. Usually the disease
yielded to summer treatment and
students were able to continue

‘school in the fall.

There were also unpleasant
cases where students did not take
advantage of the opportunity with
fatal results. _

X-rays are taken without the
removal of any " clothes and the
student will merely have to leave
his name and address so that/ re-
sults can be forwarded.

About three per cent are asked
to return because of defective
negatives or because of some
warning sign. which the ﬁlm re-
veals. ‘

In charge of the project is Dr.

loaned by the Navy Department
to the Public Health Service,
which at" present is working in
conjunction ‘with the Pittsburgh

Don't Get Stuck
with Thai Stick

By Harry Byron Keck ,
Managing Editor
E. A. Holbrook, dean of the School of Engineering and Mines,
last week conducted a personal investigation of the slide rule situa-
tion as it pertains to upp-erclass engineering veterans and issued a
statement designed to assuage embittered engineers who have re-
ceived from the Veterans Administration slide rules they consider

write to the district office of the

inferior.

under the GI Bill have signed their

names to a petition seeking new .

slide rules from the VA to replace
the rules they now have. The pe-
tition is posted on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
bulletin board in State Hall under
the phrase “Don’t get stuck with
that stick.”

Bookstore authorities since, have
revealed that in the future no
more sliderules other than K & E
and Deitzen will be ordered for
GI engineers. The magnitude of
complaints against the rules that
have been issued was stated as the
major factor behind the decision.

“The reason we haven’t been is-

suing the kind, of slide rule the
men want, the kind we feel they
should have,” stated the clean, “is

that we haven’t been able to get a
them. The University has a stand- ‘

ing order with Keuffel and Esser,
and with Deitzgen for more than
1000 slide rules. Because of this
we had K & E rules last year
when Carnegie Tech had practic-
ally’ none.”
fDisapproval of the rules being
issued centers around the fact that
the calibrations are printed, not
etched, and are not ﬁne enough
to give the desired accuracy -in
slide rule calculations. An unor-
thodox
draws criticism -from disgruntled
engineers. , C _
Dean H‘olbrook’s statement dis-
closed the fact that “K & E” ra-
tioned the University to 155 rules
and Deitzen’s allotment was six
rules.
“Knowing that six or
hundred slide rules would be
needed, .bookstore’ ‘ofﬁcials dis-

cussed. the matter with several

engineering professors. ‘Their
opinion was that, since slide rules
are absolutely necessary, it was

-better to purchase the unpopular

rules than have none at all.
.“The bookstore was able to ob-

dim at 8:30 for tonight’s program
and at 3 p.m. for Sunday after-
noon’s concert.

seless’ Record Exam

Necessary for

Students

More students swear at the Graduate Record Examination than

at any other bit of hocus-pocus at the University. A
I Groaning at the thought of two afternoons spent in talking the
test, they think up sorts of dodges to avoid it, but they lose in the

end.
Although the results of the
graduation, each college student

‘exam have no direct bearing on
as asophomore and as a senior

is required by action of theﬂfac-9

ulty to take the test before ob-
taining a degree.

"Known in the College as the
Tests of General Education, the
exam is sponsored by the Car-
negie Foundation, which main-
tains a General Record Office in
‘New York where every individual
score‘, is kept on ﬁle. There test
results for thousands of students

.are sorted and analyzed accord-

ing to age, sex, vocational goal,
major, and the type of college
attended.

Annual surveys have shown
Pittistiudents to be above the na-
tional’ group V in general mathe-
matics, sciences, and social studies.

But our performance in liter-

ature, arts, and effectiveness of

 expression falls slightly short of

the national average. After the
mysterious additions and subtrac-
tions of psychologists, however,
Pitt’s score generally is rated av-

 ‘erage.

Innucontent, the exam covers
eight principal ﬁelds of a liberal
education, and is constructed on

'~ aibroad and varied basis to avoid

giving an advantage to the stu-
dent who has mastered a speciﬁc
ﬁeld.

Emphasis is placed upon the
ability to comprehend exactly, to
think clearly in. terms of speciﬁc
problems and ideas, and to evalu-
ate" critically.

The highest scorer is usually
the student with a knowledge of
concepts and’ principles, rather
than a few disjunctive facts. ,

.When results show a student to
be below par, in a certain ﬁeld, he
realizes his weakness and can car-
rect it. The test also 0’ acts as a
weather vane pointing to the ﬁeld

-‘ .in which his greatest abilities lie,

permitting him to proceed with
conﬁdence in choosing a college
course or vocation.

‘Some day the results of these
examinations will serve as the
-frame on which future education
programs will be built. Today,

however, its greatest value is to I

the student.

Eornellas Cleopalra
Brings High Royally
lo Nixon Audiences

Majesty comes to the Nixon
stage this week in the presence
of both‘ Cleopatra and Katherine
Cornell, and the response can only
be given in superlatives. In bring-
ing Shakespeare’s tragedy to the
stage once more, Miss Cornell has
successfully accomplished a_ task
attempted many times by others.

The play marks her sixteenth
presentation as America’s only
actress—manager and provides her
with her ﬁfth classic role, her last

being that of Juliet. Twelve of

these have been box-ofﬁce hits;
seven of them toured the country
and one of them, “The Barrett’s
of Wimpole Street” was applauded
by Gl’s in France and Italy when
she took the play overseas in 1944.
I The complexities of Cleopatra
are given a new understanding by
Miss Cornell. She has been pre-
paring for the role “of the lass
unparalleled” for many years and
brings a new warmth, a new vi-
brancy to what is «probably one
of the greatest psychological stud-
ies in literature.

The love shared by Antony and
Cleopatra is a strange one. Miss
Cornell made known that strange
and noble love in a truly mem-
orable scene over Antony’s corpse.
It is her play, she dominates it
completely; the laurels and the
curtain calls are well-earned.

Challenges Student Congress
To Replace Words with Deeds
And Present a Detailed Plan

Golightly

Last» Friday Student Congress put on one of the best bally-
hoo shows in many a year. In what some choose to call a
scathing attack, they indignantly demanded a probe of-the

University athletic set up and
the city papers and the,News.

thereby made the headlines in

A few individuals in Congress———aided by some alumni--are
out to unseat certain personages in the University athletic set-
up. That a few leaders ‘of the student body are using Congress
as a front for their attacks is regrettable.

However, I am convinced particularly with the insincerity

and obvious desire for publicity’

which the Congress displays. To
expose this, it is necessary to re-
examine the statement of Frank-
lin Blackstone, president of inter-
fraternity council and a junior

representative of Congress.

Said Blackstone: “No one has
information con-
cerning Pitt’s athletic policy, and
I doubt that anyone ever will.”

Why does Congress announce a
probe when they have no expec-
tation of achieving anything
Congress knew about the football
schedule in October, 1946. Why
delay a year to institute a probe?

Any sincere body which criti-
cizes will, in addition, offer an
alternative plan or concrete steps
which should be followed. Bob
Dickey, a junior representative of
Congress, demanded “some sort of
remunerative system for the va-
rious athletic teams.”

What sort of system does Dickey
suggest? The student body is en-
titled to a detailed explanation of
the “remunerative system” Con-
gress proposes. Does Congress
have any sort of plan?

Olsonmen Test
Titan's Five  
Game Streak

Riding high on a ﬁve game vic-
tory streak, the Westminster har-
riers blow into town Saturday,
hoping to add the Panthers to
their string. The Olsonmen cur-
rently boast a record of two wins
and a loss.

Sudz-ina, Hall and Wilson have
been the-big guns for Pitt this
season, while Jackson looms as
the major Titan star. The last
time out, the Westminster thin-
clads trounced Mt. Union 24-32.

Last Saturday the Pittmen ab-
sorbed a 15-40 shellacking at the
none-too—gentle hands of Penn
State’s Lions. The fact that the
Lions. are generally acclaimed the
nation’s best .took some of the
sting out of the defeat. But the
Panthers still smarting from the
loss will go all out against the
Titans tomorrow.

Wes Leads Ohioans
Into. Stadium Battle

By Donald Giﬁin
Wesley Fesler is coming back, and bringing a football team
with him. He will be directing his Ohio State Buckeyes in a grid-
iron duel with the Pitt Panthers, manipulated by Coach Mike Milli-
gan, his line assistant last year, at the Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
Milligan’s luckless ’leven will be bucked by an Ohio State
squad, whose rabid alumni are ‘pressing the team and coaches for
another win. The Buckeyes may satisfy, for they showed signs of
improvement last Saturday, when they rallied in the second half

to tie sky,happy Iowa, 13-13.
The return of Halfback Bob

Brugge, a great competitor, to 5

the Ohio lineup in the latter half
of the fray was the spark the
Staters needed. Brugge snared two
passes to set up the tying touch-
downs. A
Forward Wall Weak

Nevertheless, statistics show
conclusively the weakness of the
Buck line. Missouri, in dropping
the opener to the Feslermen, out-

’rushed,State, 261 to 231 yards,

with an outweighed line prying
open the holes. The following
week Purdue’s Boilermakers pil-

ed up 365 yards through the los-

er’s forward wall.

In contrast to a starless line, A

the Ohio backﬁeld has several
top-caliber runners. Jarring Joe
Whisler, the Big Nine’s leading
fullback in_ 1945, is a good bet to
repeat in thesame role this year.
Whisler tallied the Buckeye’s two
touchdowns in the Missouri con-
test. Ollie Cline, a ﬁrst-string full-
back on any other team, spells
Whistler.
Sensenbaugher Best Back

State has a carbon copy of Bud-
dy Young in shifty halfback, J im-
my Clark. Dean Sensenbaugher,
Buck right-halfback, has actually
proved a better broken-ﬁeld run-
ner than Clark. Against Purdue,
he thrilled the crowd with a 98-
yard kickoff return and a 62-yard
jaunt through the entire Boiler-

. maker team.

Pandel Savic earned the start-
ing quarterback post tomorrow
with his clever calling and pass-

two squads. Many want to see

ing in the Iowa deadlock last
week. Pete Perini will enter the
game at this position to do the
punting. The third quarterback,
Emil Moldea, will boot at the up-
rights if and when Ohio State
scores. . -

A throng of 60,000 is expected
to‘ ﬁll the Stadium tomorrow, de-
spite the dismal records of the

popular Wes Fesler’s' new Ohio
State team, while others ﬁgure
that this is Pitt’s last good chance
to put the “whammy” on the big
Nine hooddoo. .

OSU Tilt
To Decide
Pitt's Fate ‘

Tomorrow’s Ohio State game
has the makings of the season's
key game. A victory can instill
the ‘Panthers with a winning spir-
it. A loss can drown them in de-
spair.

Then, too, _a win might take‘

some of the seasoning out of the
stew that Student Congress and
numerous alumni have been brew-
ing for the Athletic Department.
This game is the turning point,
the Saratoga of the local football
revolution.

Mike Milligan’s boys are not
the type that enjoy being walked
on once a week, and, with all due
respect to their former coach, Wes
Fesler, they aim to scatter the
Buckeyes about the ﬁeld like so
many crushed nuts on a sundae.

Panthers to Be Tough

To be sure, the Jungle Cats are
no world beaters, but they’re not
really the mess they looked last
week. Not overlooking Michigan,
Illinois was their toughest oppo-
nent.

Competent observers believe
that if the Panthers can score in
the ﬁrst quarter and keep some
sort of an ofﬁense under way,
they can win.

Injured Bruno Returns

No team has yet scored on them ‘

in the ﬁrst period. If the Panthers
can get on the big end of the score,
they may ﬁght doubly hard to
make every quarter a ﬁrst quar-
ter. V
The defense will be strengthen-‘
ed immeasurably by the return of
the injured Bill Bruno. The Jean-
nette quarterback is a demon eat
stopping‘ wide end sweeps, a
source of much annoyance to the
Panthers. _ .

Fullback Lindy Lauro may see
considerable action tomorrow, Al-
though third string, he has man-
aged to lead the Pitt backs in
total yards gained. \

Two _More Sidelined. ’

As usual, a sizeable crew of
Pitt players will be on the side-
lines with injuries. Newest mem-
bers are Guard Tony Razzano and
Halfback Elmer Kozzora, Johnny
Kosh and" Bill Abraham, both
probably out for the season, are
the senior members. «

 

Bob Chappuis, the Toledo Ter- V

ror who plays halfback for Michi-
gan, set a new _Big Nine record
of 1,039 yards from running and
passing last season.

Hardisty Enjoys
Hs Kicking Hole

By Bob Van Atta

Bill (Humphrey) Hardisty, the happy—go—lucky
punting sensation of the Panthers, still represents
“unconquered” .
charges of the Illinois, Notre Dame, Michigan and
Indiana forward walls.

“I could stand back there all day and kick that
ball,” says the man who will set Ohio State back
with his booming spirals tomorrow.

The appelation of “Humphrey” has been assign-
ed the sophomore quarterback because of his al-
leged physical resemblance to the fabulous Joe,
Paloka comic strip character. Another ‘nom de plume
of the ex-Langley High star is “Joe Toe.”

Bill’s kicking average was 38.2 yards per punt
for the first four games. This despite a blocked kick

spirit after surviving the

in the Hoosier contest" and several over the goal
line in preceding games.

“In my two years at Pitt,” Bill
revealed, “I’ve played every posi-
tion except guard. I started at

even stopping back at fullback.

Typical of the character that
speeds onto the ﬁeld to boot the
ball downﬁeld is the picture that
appeared, in the Stadium program
for the Notre Dame game. Amidst
individual pictures of sober-faced
squad members appeared a mis-
chievous grin on the face of Har-
disty, the athlete who is putting

Juniors Plan Frolic

Junior women meet in 1228 C1.
next Friday to enjoy the class
of 1949's Fall Frolic, engineered
by the Junior class cabinett for
all Junior women.

Publicity director of the class,
Mimi Cooper, reports that besides
cider and doughnuts, there is an-

. other surprise. The program com-

mittee refuses to reveal much
about the entertainment, but Miss
Cooper did state that party dress
won’t ﬁt the motif; heels are out,
and so are crepe dresses.

“Come prepared for a good,o1d-
fashioned time,” warns Barbara
Schropp, president of the class
and chief pilot for the Frolic. The
get together is scheduled from
3:30 ’til. 5 p. In. so that all Junior
women may join in the fun.

Rood Heads Committee

Miss Dorothy Rood, head of the
department of public health nurs-
ing of the University, has been ap-
pointed chairman of a committee
to study and recommend changes
in the ‘preparation of school
nurses.

The committee, set upgby the
Pennsylvania Organization for
Public Health Nursing, must take
into consideration acts passed at
recent sessions of the Legisla-
ture. The acts provide for increas-
ed service by the school nurse.
Number 522, for example, requires
schools to follow up defects which
have been found in physical ex-
aminations.

There have been no changes in
school nursing policy for a long
time, and it is hoped that the find-
ings of Miss Rood’s committee will
have a great bearing on the future
school health program.

Storage Tank

A Pitt graduate of the class of
’47 has turned a schoo1—born idea
into a money-saving reality.

  

<

W.

Alex Fino, who graduated froml

the University with a Bachelor
of Science degree in mechanical
engineering with an overall QP
average of 2.88. worked out plans
for a new type of tank for the
storage of high volatile liquids.

According to Thomas G. Beck-
with, associate professor of me-
chanical engineering, the new type
of storage tank employs a mov-
able diaphragm that eliminates
both breathing and ﬁlling losses.
Storage tanks now in use are con-
trolled for either breathing or
ﬁlling losses, but not both.’

Fino took his idea to the Ham-
mond Iron Works in Warren,
Ohio, where a test tank was built
and tested satisfactorily.

First bridge in Pittsburgh was
built across the Monongahela at
Smithﬁeld Street in 1818.
