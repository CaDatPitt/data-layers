To Talk At ODK Dinner

The ODK executive who formally installed Gamma Cir-
cle at the University forty years ago will be the main speaker
at the Fortieth Anniversary Celebration Banquet tonight.

Dr. William Mosely Brown, president of Enoch College,
will address ODK at the annual Founder’s Day Banquet at
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. He has been national
president and National secretary?

,.k\

of ODK.

N o r In a n McCleod, University
Trustee, and a charter member of
Gamma Circle, will serve as mas-
ter of ceremonies. In addition to
three associate members tapped
last Wednesday and ten under-
graduates, approximately one
hundred ODK alumni will attend.

Omicron Delta Kappa was
founded duringvthe fall of 1913
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. Beta chapter was formed
soon after at Johns Hopkins
University. The Pitt chapter was
third in the nation. _

In the tradition of “idealism
and leadership,” the 15 originators
of the Circle at Washington and
Lee formulated the idea that all-
around leadership should be re-
cognized, that representative men
in all phases of campus life should
cooperate in worthwhile endeavor,
and that outstanding students and

faculty members should meet on

 

a basis of mutual, interest and

understanding.

The Senior-junior scholastic-
activities honorary at Pittsburgh
has promoted the concepts and
has, in addition to the nationwide
program, sponsored an annual
Senior Award to single out and
reward the man who is symbolic
of the type of well-rounded per-

son the University attempts to"

produce. The Senior Awardee
since 1922 has had his name en-
graved on ODK Walk between
Heinz Chapel and the Cathedral.

New Hope For Wayward Students

Abusive Behavior

By FITZHUGH SCHENLEY

Emulation of nature’s crea-
tures, long an effective means
for scientiﬁc progress, is sup-
plementing Pitt’s conventional
progress at least.

Observers in Clapp Hall

suspect that the biology courses
have been inspiration for the ap-
pearance of fresh footprints on
the walls there. Despite humans’
unnatural adaptiveness to the 10-
comotive methods of the insect
world, these encouraging results
are achieved by standing on one
leg with the other bracing the
body against the wall.

Other manifestations of the
growing animal-behavior of Pitt
students are readily seen in the
new Clapp Hall building. The
large assortment of cigarette butts
on hallway floors, the soiled and
chipped auditorium seats, the “col-
lapsed” collapsible arms on lecture
room chairs: all are indicative of
the popularity of the new -trend.

University officials needn’t be
grave about this apparent abuse,
for indeed it may be interpreted
as a new educational concept
pioneered by the University.

Educational advantages are read-
ily seen, for instance, for students
of statistics. Cigarette popularity
at Pitt may now be ﬁgured di-
rectly merely by a day’s end count
of the accumulated butts on the
ﬂoor.

The same practice may be ob-
tained by obtaining ﬁgures on
popular shoe sizes’ of Pitt stu-

possible. That, plus the fact that
the construction and general lay-
out of the hotel would make it
ideal for a student dormitory.
promptedthe change of plans.
According to Dr. Peake, the
student union will consist of only
the ground floor andiﬁrst four
floors of the hotel plus the adjoin-
ing apartment building. The re-
maining ﬁve floors will become
a residence hall for men students.
Convention Divided
The University does not obtain
full occupation of all seven of the
Schenley Apartments at the same
time, because .of commitments
made with the tenants when the
buildings were bought. Conver-
sion of these buildings has been
divided into temporary and long-
range plans. ‘ _
Construction is well under
way for the conversion of the
Schenley Hotel. The ground
ﬂoor will contain an outdoor
terrace, a formal dining room, a

large _main lounge, a succession
of smaller lounges on the lobby

Deﬁnite changes" in the original plans for the University
of Pittsburgh Student Union, now undergoing construction,
have been announced today by Dr. Charles H. Peake, Assis-
tant Chancellor‘ in charge of student af_fair,s.

The original plan of converting the entire Schenley Hotel

into an adequate student union was. found to be architecturally
impractable and ﬁnancially im-O C

hotel ballroom.

Concerning the ballroom. Dr.
Peake stated that it will be the
policy of the University to hold a
dance every Friday and Saturday
night. sponsored by the Student
Union Committee. The dances will
be “of good quality and very at-
tractive.” 

A known band will always
be on hand and Dr. Peake as-

surred the student body that the"

price will be reasonable. The ball-
room will never be rented or re-
stricted to any one student or-'
ganization. It will always be open
to the entire student body.‘

Cafeteria To Open

With reference to the cafeteria,
Dr. Peake stated that »it will be
completely modern and air-condi-
tioned, and will accommodate
during the noontime period ap-
proximately 2400 students. He
added that work on the cafeteria
was started in September and it

  Brewer Named
As Manager Of

Office Service

Davis J. Brewer was appointed
last week to the new post of man-
ager of offices services for the
University by Chancellor Edward
H. Litchﬁeld.

Mr. Brewer will serve on the
staff of Walter F. Vieh, assistant
chancellor for business affairs.
His responsibilities will include

direction of the University com-
munication facilities, such as
mail and telephone and tele-
graph service. He will organize
and operate a centr.al stenc-
graphic bureau and printing and
duplicating service to serve all
departments of the university.

Mr. Vieh said that the intro-
duction of a central office facility
is expected to bring about not
only improved services for the
faculty but should affect econo-
mics through better utilization of
office machines and personnel.

Mr. Brewer formerly was em-
ployed by the Columbian Nation-

io'usly he had worked for the Du-
quesne Light Company, U.S. Steel

THAT little round object is a new kind of Timken“
tapered roller bearing for your car. It's the big change
in bearings that meets the big change in cars. It helps im-
prove ride, increases safety, prolongs car life, aids styling,
protects trade-in value. And it's available!

It's also a wedding ring. V

With‘ it the Timken Company recements the 57-year
partnership between ourselves and the auto industry.

It's the product of a whole new approach to the design,
manufacture and supply of automotive bearings. A concept
pioneered by the Timken Company and launched in a new
kind of bearing plant, built at a cost of $12,000,000. A
concept mated to the swiftly changing needs of a fantasti-
cally mushrooming auto industry.

We call it the Moto-Muted Way.

From the Moro-Mated Way comes a whole new breed of
Timken tapered roller bearings for wheels, pinion, differ-
ential, steering gear. Smaller bearings to save space. Lighter
bearings to cut unsprung weight, improve comfort.
Lower-priced bearings. Strong bearings to handle all the
new power. Wear-resistant bearings to maintain your car’s

It's how the Timken‘ Company works with industry;

year, will offer ,a deﬁnite advan-
tage. To future" government em-
ployees, the study of such exces-
sive costs will be excellent back-
ground training in bureaucratic
practices.

Of course, science students
may take this condition as an
opportunity to do research on
developing more durable Uni-
versity furnishings. Though this
be in direct oppostion to bu-
reaucracy students, there is no
doubt that the research itself is
a noble project. In fact, it may
someday bring fame to the uni-
versity if effective products are
developed. 0

This would bring an excellent
windfall to the University, for it
will probably attract increased en-
dowments as well as more stu-
dents to Pitt.

Wlmt Is A University?

Few places on earth permit freer opinions than do uni-
versities. Discussion is the rule rather than the exception.
And any attempt to suppress this basic motive of a univer-
sity is an attack not only on a particular institution but on
all universities. -

Similarly,lif a university must rise in rebellion, even
to the death of its students, in order to assert the property
of freedom of expression, that institution rises in the name
of all universities. This is why institutions of higher learn-
ing the world over must respond to the needs of the re-
belling university students of Hungary.

In Hungary, the ﬁght was against concepts of suppres-
sion of free thoughts, puppeteering, misrepresentation. -The
ﬁght was against mass destruction of personal liberty. The
ﬁght struck at the violation of university ideals. _

What have other institutions done to save this dying
brother. this symbol of freedom? Emergency aid drives
and rallies have been conducted. Yale University had a
fund—raising rally at and after which $3500 was raised for
the Hungarian students. Yale has also sent sample forms
to other universities concerning details on how the rally
was planned in order to keep alive the symbol of freedom
of 5 WV) miles away. _

Other brothers of freedom——universities—-have organized
relief drives; Last week Chatham College sponsored such
a rallv - V

Here at Pitt, we have realized in a small way our obli-

gation to rescue a brother of freedom. Proceeds from the /—

Pitt Chest which exceed the $3500 initial goal will go to
Hungarian relief. However, no group or individuals on
campus have as yet promoted an active drive for rescuing
the dying.Hungarian university ideals.

Something should be done. Something must be done at

Pitt.‘ For to. preserve the Hungarian freedom is to preserve '

ourselves.

“Cult Of Personality," the System . . .

Vagrant Assault

By lrv_ Rothman
Two weeks ago a downtown vagrant brutally
kicked a businessman into unconsciousness while
onlookers, afraid to involvefthemselves, watched.
Without question, Hungarian revolutionaries feel
like the beaten man who, within his rights to pub-
lic protection, was unable to receive assistance when

he needed it. However, the aggressor, condemned.

and sighted by the onlookers, » 
was apprehended.

But were we to extend the
analogy, it is -dubious we could.
apprehend the Russian aggressor
so easily, although we’re more
willing to help.

It is obvious that the United

tive policyto follow in correcting
that injustice.‘ But in the martyrdom of the Hun-
garian hungry, the true character of the Russian
government is apparent. F_ew_world nations can any
longer accept “Geneva smiles” in rationalization for
positive peaceful action. ’

The truth is most obvious to those closest to the

situation——-the communist satellites. Gomulko’s Po-'

land having adopted its modiﬁed communistic gov-
ernment and eyeing the consequences in Hungary
is as well cognizant of recent Tito denouncements
of Russian armed policy.

Yugos1avia’s Marshall Tito, whose brand of com-
munism has been considered corrupted communism
by Politburo members, has outlined the indepen-
dent hope of all satellites by pointing opportunely
to Hungary.

We must realize that the condemnation of
“Stalin” last year has considerably weakened the
propaganda of the USSR opening up -even the
present government to criticism.

But to ‘Tito Stalin’s purge had larger meaning.
In his now famous November 11 speech, Tito said,

Thanks To Dag  .

 

“. . . at the Twentieth Congress they (Soviet Union)
condemned Stalin’s actions and his policies followed
up to then, but they wrongly considered the whole
thing as the question of ‘‘cult of personality” and
not a question ‘of the system.

But what‘ can we in the United States do about
the situation? Hungary has been outwardly crush-
ed, Poland relatively subdued, Yugoslavia still wary,
East Germany frightened.

Troops. Withdrawal _

According to Richard Lowenthal, editorial writ-
er for the London Observer, our big chance to act
is now past." Writing in the Nov. 26 edition of
The New Republic, he stated that the United States
should have offered to withdraw all troops from
Europe on the condition Russia withdrew from all
satellite nations. Such a proposal, made at the

height of fighting in Hungary, would have had’

two effects.

Such a grandiose proposal would have a power-
ful impact upon neutral nations and our embit-
tered allies throughout Europe, including satellite
nations which still blink at powerful U.S. forces in

S the West. 1

According to Lowenthal, it might have also of-
fered Russia a face-saving method to withdraw
from Hungary without more bloodshed and a chance
to retain its smiling countenance.

The actual psychological moment is now past.
The UN will have little legal right to enter Hun-

gary because the controlling government will not ,
permit it. Perhaps‘ we should strive for closer ‘
,diplomatic—economic ties with Tito.

Possibly, if
further action breaks out, the United States govern-
ment could challenge Russia’s intentions before
world governments with such a proposal.

For the present, the Hungarians who have died
will remain martyrs to an illuminating cause—the
crass realization that world communism has been
weakened because the brute force it thrives on
has been bared.

Sleeping Giant Stirring

By Ed Bachman
For the greater part of- its

eleven years.

Ignoring UN

eleven-year history the United

Nations did little more than talk.‘

And talk, it has been proven, is
cheap. What has been _ needed
since the birth of the UN in,1945
has been a little more construc-
tive action,‘and a lot‘ less hot air.

But ﬁnally, this past Novem--

ber, the United Nations, a po-
tential sleeping giant of hope for

the free world, Woke up a. bit.‘

And it was not any single nation
or group of nations which
brought about this long-awaited
and needed awakening. But it
was the immagination and cap-
abilities of a single man — Dag
Hammarskjold, the Secretary-
General of the UN.

Dag’s brainstorm has been

officially termed the United Na- '

ti_ons Emergency Force (UNEF).
The theory of this police force
is sound and good, but the im-
portant thing of its initiation is
that the UN has ﬁnally seen that
it can shape the world’s history
by actions, and not meaningless
words, so many of which have
gone by the boards in the past

— World Federalists.

Definite Step

UNEF, though presently small
and without the complete back-
ing of the entire world, is a de-
ﬁnite step in the direction of
lasting peace. The present hand-
ful of men who make up this
tiny police force has great po-
tential toward growing into what
this world has needed for so long
-—a powerful band of men from
all nations which will be avail-
able to stop all squabbles be-
tween nations, which, if left
alone, could develop into a
dreaded war:

A large group of men through-
out the world has pushed for
such a great police force for
quite some time. This group has
called themselves the United‘
The. UWF
since 1947 has struggled to gain
attention of major powers to
listen to their proposition of a

-world police force, but pleas

have fallen on deaf ears. Many
nations insisted that it was up
to the UN to initiate such a

force. But the UN was impotent. -

Then came the present Middle i
With’ such I

Eastern difficulties.
powers _as Great Britain and
France ignoring UN “demands”

to cease their aggression in the

Suez Canal area, the United Na-
tions found itself at a crucial
crossroads. It had to ﬁnd some
means of impressing majority
will upon even the biggest pow-
ers. If it failed in this, the UN
would die as did the League of
Nations before it. The UN had
to assume power which never
was written into its charter back
in 1945. So the time was ripe for

Hammarskjold to initiate his po- ‘

lice force idea.
But the UN must follow

through with this police force.i

It will be only as powerful as
the world desires to make it.
And to be a power, it must be
physically able to handle any
offender to the world’s peace. As
French Foreign Minister Chris-
tian Pineau recently told the UN
General Assembly: “The UN

must decide to impose its de- »

cisions on everyone or resign it-
self to impose them on no one.”

Editor, The Pitt News:

Do you like to pay 48 cents a
quart for milkwhen others pay
only 25 cents? Well, you are!
Our cafeteria charges twelve
cents for a half pint of milk, or
in other words 48 cents a quart,
whereas the outside w o r l d
charges only 25 cents a quart.
Why should we University stu-
dents pay 23 cents aaquart more,
almost double, for milk? The
bottle is returned to the milk
company, so they can’t say they
charge for the bottle. It can’t be
the cost of handling because the
company will deliver it right to
your door for half the price you
pay here. Tell me, Editor and

double for milk? Investigate,

Editor, The Pitt News:

The action of the Pitt football
team against Army is certainly
one that cannot be reproached.
The action of the University, on
that same day, certainly is to be
reproached. Saturday, November
17, at half time an action was
executed which I feel is a dis-
grace to the University of Pitts-
burgh. Under the “Send the
Band to South1and” committee,
students collected money from

fellow students and what is

 

rse , from aspectato ‘rig ord‘

 

to be able to send the University

Band to Miami. It appeared to
me that this was certainly un-
ethical of a ‘University with a

hundred million dollar budget. I ,

also wondered where the money
from full house crowds and the
hundred and ﬁfty thousand dol-
lars from the Sugar Bowl went
to. The Pitt band is rated one "of
the top bands in the country. Its
performances have brought us
much recognition. T h e r e f o r e
they deserve to go to Miami on
December 8th. Since the game
is going to be televised, the
band’s performance would be
seen by millions of people. There
is certainly no better way to
prove that the University de-
serves to be rated among top
institutions. However, by collect-
ing funds from spectators, they
will 5 never» meet the obligations
that a top institution must as-
sume. ’

. Tall and dark Adriana Rossi,
Pitt co—ed, hails from the Pam-
pas of the Argentine where
college life is a far cry from
the American version of high-
er education.

Miss Rossi, a native of Rosario.
Argentina, received the Univer-

A _sity. of Pittsburgh Awards Tuition

Scholarship and the Pennsylvania

. Federation of Business and Pro-

fessional Women ,Award Scholar-
ship. She is an attractive, modest
young woman who speaks ﬂuent
English with a slight {Latin ac-
cent noticeable more for its pre-
cise enunciation than for its for-
eign ﬁavor. .

She is a graduate student study-
ing international relations. This is
her first visit to the United States,
and for the past three months she
has been adapting herself to col-

’ lege life American style. .

0 ‘South American methods are
quite different from American,
she says. In Argentina the stu-
dent is expected to work on his
own. There are no standard text
books, periodic tests, or class
curves, and the students do not
have to attend lectures if they
feel they can get along without
them.
It is up to the individual to study
a subject thoroughly. When he
feels adequately prepared, he takes
a ﬁnal oral examination. Upon
satisfactory completion of the oral
exam, the student may go on to
the next phase of study in his
chosen ﬁeld.

—.—.W,s;,Argentine colleges and univer-

sities‘are mostly national institu-
tions. They are subsidized by the
state, -and there are no tuition
fees. A young person just out of

highschool having passing grades ,

and satisfactory civic behavior

-need only applyto be accepted.

When asked about her ﬁrst
impressions of Pitt, Miss Rossi
said what impressed her most
was -the courtesy of the men.
“They always say ‘excuse me’
when they pass you in the halls
and on the elevators. They are
very courteous.” She went on to
say she also liked the way
American men dress. “The vari-

"-~~»e1‘:y of colors in their clothing is

very pleasing, and they are
really —quite handsome, so tall
and athletic-looking.”

Miss Rossi is not used to the
casual atmosphere between stu-
dents and instructors found here
at Pitt; in Argentina the relation-
ship is more formal. Argentine
lectures do not have as much class
participation. It is taken _for
granted that the students are
aware of the practical side of the

Van Heusen has discovered
that its originator was actually
Arthur A. Chester, who, oddly
enough, used the button not to
keep his collar down, but to
keep his shirt up. Whatever its
purpose, the Oxford Button-

  HAPPY TALK

As we all know, conversation is terribly important
on a date. When lulls in the conversation run longer than
an hour or two, one’s partner is inclined to grow logy -
even sullen. What, then, does one do?

If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of
Harlow Thurlow.

Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret.

Before the date, he goes to the library and reads all 24 .

volumes of the encyclopedia and transcribes their con-
tents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure that no matter
what his date’s interests are, he will have ample material
to keep the conversation alive. . ' ,

Take, for example, Harlow’s ﬁrst date with Priscilla
de Gasser, aﬁne, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl,
lavishly constructed and rosy as the dawn.

Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for

Priscilla, and, as always, he did not start to converse im- »

mediately. First he took her to dinner because, as every-
one knows, it is useless to try to make conversation with
an unfed coed. .

So he took her to a ﬁne steak house where he stoked
her with gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French
fries and thickets of escarole and battalions of petits
fours. Then, at last, dinner was over and the waiter
brought two ﬁnger bowls. ’

_“I_ hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear,” said
Harlow, dipping into his ﬁnger bowl.

“Oh, it-was grandy—dandy !” said Priscilla. “Now let’s

go someplace for ribs.”

“Later, perhaps,” said Harlow. “But right now, I
thought we might have a conversation.”

“Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!” cried Priscilla. “I

been looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on an

intelligent conversation.”

“Your search is ended, madam,” said Harlow and
pulled back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a
likely. topic to start the conversation. A s

 

Oh, woe! Oh, lackaday! Those cuffs on which Harlow
had painstakingly transcribed such diverse and fasci-

nating information—— those cuffs were nothing now but

a big, blue blur! For Harlow-—poor Harlow! — splashing
around in the ﬁnger bowl had gotten his cuffs wet and
the ink had run and not one word was legible! And
Harlow broke out in a night—sweat and fell dumb.

“I must say,” said Priscilla after several silent hours,
“that you are a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”

With that she ﬂounced away and poor Harlow was
too crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a
cigarette.

All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. “Was
that,” she asked, “a Philip Morris you just lit?”

“Yes,” said Harlow.

. “Then you are not a dull fellow l” she cried and sprang
into his lap. “You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke
such a perfect doll of a cigarette as today’s rich, tasty
Philip Morris, which is brimming-full of natural tobacco

goodness and fresh unﬁltered ﬂavor.... Harlow, tiger,

wash your cuﬁs and be my love!”
“Okay,” said Harlow, and did, and,was.

NC State Tops Cagers, 907 -85

Don Hennon Stars
In Varsity Debut;
Play OSU Tonight

13;} ED KOLTISKA
North Carolina State con-
tinued their mastery over the
Panther cagers as they edged
the Jungle Cats, 97-85, in the
ﬁrst basketball game of the

season for both teams.

The series between the two
schools stands at three games and
the locals have been on the short
end of the score in all three tilts.

The Panthers fought up-hill all
through thet game before ﬁnally

succumbing to the Wolfpack by a
twelve-point margin. Although
North Carolina State lost four
starters through graduation, Ccach
Everett Case’s new starters jump-
ed off to a lead in the opening
minutes of the game.
Hennon Stars

Finally settling down, the Pan-
thers sophomore sensation Don
Hermon began clicking on his set
shots from the outside to enable
the Jungle Cats to take over the
lead, 7-6.

The Panthers kept this lead
for ten. minutes before Coach
Case sent in John Richter, his
6-8 sophomore from Philadel-
phia. The shooting spark , of
Richter ﬁred-up the Wolfpack
as they shot to a 40-22 lead at
the half.

Hennon’s consistent deadly
shooting overshadowed the driv-
ing layups of Richter as he led
both teams in scoring honors with
34 points. .

State Lead Narrowed

As the second-half got under
way, the Staters had trouble ﬁnd-
ing the basket and the Panthers
whittled the lead to 40-39 before
the Wolfpack scored again.

Sharp shooting by Julius
Pegues. John Riser, and Bob
Lazor, along with the ball con-
trol of Chuck Hursh, enabled

the Jungle Cats to come within

four points of North Carolina
State, 89-85, with only four min-
utes remaining in the game.
At this point Panther Coach
Bob Timmons called for a full-
court press.

Penalties Hurt

‘The strategly backﬁred, how-
ever, as the aggressive Panthers
committed a host of penalties
along with out—of-bound calls in
the last few minutes of play.

Sharing scoring honors with
Hennon were Pegues with 15
points and Lazor with 14 while
Riser and Hursh connected for
nine and seven points respective-
ly.

Although tagged with a loss,
Coach Timmons was pleased

with the shooting ability of
Hennon as well as the ﬂoor play
by the rest of the squad.

With only one day of rest, the

Panthers will travel to Columbus,‘
Ohio, tonight to tangle with the
Ohio State Buckeyes.
’ The Buckeyes will have three
lettermen returning to the start-
ing lineup in Gene Millard, a two
year veteran acting as captain this
year‘, while Frank‘ Howard and
James Laughlin are both ﬁrst year
starters.

Kenneth Sidle and Larry Hus-
ton will round out the starting
lineup. Millard will be the small-
est man on the Ohio State squad,
sizing up at 5-9, while the other
members range between 6-4. and
6-6.

Gator Classic Features
Pitt - Tech ‘Rematch ’  

The Gator Bowl will have the smallest attendance of
the major bowl games, but it doesn’t have to take a backseat
to the Rose, Cotton, Sugar, or Orange when it comes to the
participating schools-the Pitt Panthers and the Georgia Tech

Engineers.

Both are considered choice bowl
material based on their regular
season performances and th e
twelfth anual Gator tilt at Jack-
sonville, Florida, on Dec. 29 could
very well emerge as the “magnate
of the bowls.”

Georgia Tech warmed up for
the battle by crushing Georgia,
35-0, to run their season record
to 9-1. After the game the Tech
players voted overwhelmingly to
meet the Panthers in the Gator.
The Jungle Cats announced
their acceptance last Friday. A

The Blue and Gold gridders
have a campaign chart of 6-2-1
with one game remaining, that
being with the Miami Hurricanes
next Saturday. .

Since last year’s thrilling 7-0
Sugar Bowl loss to the Rambling
Wrecks in which the locals won
everything but the score, the pub-
lic has been clamoring for a re-
turn match;

Although another Sugar pair-

l i ‘It has been four years since Bob Timmons assumed the

better portion of his three year tenure the “sleigh” has skid-

ded and spurted. This season, though, Timmons’ cagers ap-

pear ready to crack this cold front that has menaced the
‘ athletic horizon at Pitt for the previous three campaigns.

It was not uncommon during this span to see the Blue and Gold
hoopsters get plastered with humiliating defeats that ranged from 20
to 40 points. At times these lopsided affairs caused the locals to
become so erratic that it seemed as if they would never be ableeto
untrack themselves.

«<"l‘railiiig by such great margins in Lhe late stages of a game
factually demoralized the Panthers in more than one instance last
year. The players would shoot from near the foul-line and fail
‘Eto go in after the rebound, or make a half-hearted attempt to
capture a lose ball. All spirit and ﬁght quickly disintegrated and
it wasn’t long before the contest would become a rout.

After one game last year in which they got stomped unmercifully,
Athletic ‘Director Tom Hamilton hastily made his way to the dressing
room. You can be sure it was not to discuss the weather forecast.

I With‘ the weather forecasters again predicting

another blusterous winter, Timmons has a team that
should make local fans forget the cold and ﬂock to
the Field House to see his best quintet in action.
His talented personnel has all the qualities’

Awaits Panther Mermen

By IVIURRAY CHASS .
The Eastern Collegiate Swimming Association cham-
pions, the Panther mermen, will ﬁnd the road to their sixth
consecutive crown a ‘rocky one,” says veteran mentor Ben
Grady.

The local swimmers have not:
given any other team the slightest
chance for victory in the ECSA
for the past ﬁve years, during
retired one

Zurcher and Skip Monseiu,
1956 graduates, and Tony Tres-
ser, a recent naval enlistee, hold
ﬁve championships among them.

Walton, Scorsone

In Football Draft

Two standout Panther gridders
had the distinction of being pick-
ed in the first four rounds of the
National Football League draft
last week. V

The Washington Redskins se-
lected end Joe Walton on the sec-
ond round and guard Vince Scor-
sone on the fourth round.

Walton’s as-cond round choice
landed him a berth on the All-
Pro team.

Walton, a senior from Beaver
Falls, is currently tied for the
touchdown pass catching cham-
pionship of the nation. It Walton
can snare a touchdown aerial
against the Miami Hurricanes he
will automatically win the honor
for the second straight season.

‘Both Walton and Scorsone have
announced their intentions or
playing in the play-for-pay ranks.

Weisz is scholastically ineligi-
ble, and Lazorchik has chosen
to continue his studies in Italy.

problem Grady faces. Actually.

up his team’s chances for the
1957 campaign.

“It will be awful rough.” he
maintains. “We lost a lot of boys
from last year.” Somewhat pessi-
mistically he adds, “If I can win
three meets out of nine, I’ll be a
lucky guy.” A

Whether or not fans are ex-

pected to fully believe Grady’s
dim outlook can not be said.
He does, however, have basis for
thinking and saying this. Any
team would be hard-pressed the

reﬂexes "that should make him the type of go—go backcourt man that
the Jungle Cats need.
In high school Hennon never
played on a loser. He always hit

this average because of the team

The first floor of the hotel will
contain private dining rooms for
student organizations, as well as
small lounge areas where indivi-
duals can gather. Also on this
floor will be Dr. Peake’s office, a
conference room,
/library for leisure reading.

“A11 in all,” commented Dr.

Peake, “the ﬁrst floor will be a
very quiet floor, conductive to
study and thought.”
' The offices of the Dean of Men
and the Dean of Women will oc-
cupy either sides of the second
floor, along with their complete
staff.

On the third ﬂoor will be the
new Office of Admissions and
interviewing rooms. The coun-
selor for foreign students will

A dormitory for men, capable
of housing approximately 275
students, will comprise the re-

ﬁrst floor of the dormitory, will
contain a complete apartment for
the faculty residence advisor and
his ‘wife. On this floor will be a

main lounge for the students and
their guests.

Hotel Linked

In the future, Building E, ad-
jacent to the hotel, will. be the
main student union. It will be
linked with the hotel’s ﬁrst ﬁve
floors by an extension. Thus all
the union’s facilities for students
will be connected.

Building E will contain meet-
ing rooms, legislative chambers
for student governing bodies, of-
fices for permanent student ac-
tivities, and rooms for the ﬁles
and worktables of all student
organizations. A number of
soundproof listening rooms is
being planned plus a compre-
hensive music library.

Work will begin on Building E
in 1959. Until then, Building F
will be the temporary student
union. It will open in the Spring.

After 1959 all the other Schen-
ley Apartment Buildings, includ-
ing Building F will be residence
halls for men and women. One
(if these will be set aside for mar-
ried graduate students and in-
structors.

Dr. Peake has made tentative
arrangements with the president
of Student Congress to have an
opening meeting with the stu-
dents early in January. At that
time, he will make an early
progress report and answer any
questions. He hopes to follow
this meeting with numerous dis-
cussions with students concern-
ing the union.

“I appreciate the patience the
students have shown in waiting
for the uniOn,” Dr. Peake said.
“I am sure they understand that
the apparent delays are due to
the magnitude of the problems
involved in converting a hotel in-
to a Student Union. I can assure
the students that they will have,
even on a temporary basis, ample
facilities for activities.
