Cyclone pounds Bangladesh;

search continues for survivors

UPI —- Thousands of people are
missing after a cyclone slammed into
southern Bangladesh on Friday.
Officials set the death toll at 1,400,
which only indicates the number of
bodies buried,

number of deaths. Rescue ships are
continuing to search for the thou-
sands believed to have been washed
into the bay. ‘
The Press Trust of India news
agency said in its dispatch from
Dhaka that the death toll could

. reach 40,000 and that 200,000 peo-

ple were left homeless by the storm,
the worst to hit the-region since the
hurricane that killed 300,000 people

i in 1970.

The seas were reportedly littered
with ﬂoating bodies. According to
the government-run Bangladesh
Radio, 80 percent of the croplands
had been devasted and it was feared
that 500,000 cattle were missing.

The storm hit the region around
midnight Friday and continued to
pound the area Saturday, sweeping
across the Bay of Bengal and strik-
ing Urirchar Island and six others. A
Bangladesh police officer said at
least 5,000 people were killed on
Urirchar Island.alone. The storm-
generated waves averaged eight to
12 feet _high while winds reached a
velocity of up to 140 miles per hour.

Lt. Gen. H.M. Ershad, the presi-
dent of Bangladesh, toured the
stricken areas Monday. He called
the disaster a “terrible shock” and
appealed to other nations for help.
(In Washington, the State Depart-
ment said the United States was
making an initial emergency gift of
$25,000 to Bangladesh for disaster
assistance.)

Ershad called a special cabinet
meeting to review the situation and
plan emergency action to be taken
by his military government. The
president decreed a nationwide day
of mourning yesterday, with the flag
to be ﬂown at half staff and prayers
at all places of worship.

He also ordered air force helicop-
ters and four navy ships tojoin army

and air force rescue teams. Officials
said about 4,000 people have already
been rescued from the sea. Survivors
were reportedly seen on bamboo
rafts and floating roof tops in waters
infested by sharks and crocodiles.
Much of the area was still being
swept by high winds and waves,
hampering rescue efforts.

‘Silent ‘killer’ awareness urged
by American Heart Association

Although health awareness
should be a year-round concern, the
Western Pennsylvania Chapter of
the American Heart Association is
urging all Allegheny County resi-
dents to consider a special health
matter — high blood pressure.

Allegheny County residents with
high blood pressure are part of the
almost 60 million Americans who
suffer from this condition. Of these,
nearly ’38 million definitely have
high blood pressure, and 22 million
have blood pressure which requires
medical attention by a physician.

According to Dr. Joseph M.

Young, president of the Western
Pennsylvania Chapter, high blood
pressure is a puzzling disease.

“People who have high blood
pressure are generally not aware ofit
until they have it checked,” Young
said. “It is called the silent killer
because unlike most diseases or
injuries, it doesn’t hurt. And with 90
percent of high blood pressure cases,
the cause is unknown.”

High blood pressure can usually
be effectively controlled, and treat-
ment may prevent stroke, heart
attack, congestive heart failure and
kidney failure.

The scheduling of PAT bus
and trolley services will be fully
computerized under a contract
approved today by the board of
the Port Authority of Allegheny
County.

“This is one of a series of steps
initiated last year to streamline
PAT operations and cut operat-
ing costs," said William Millar,
PAT executive director. “It will
speed up the process of analyz-
ing, revising and updating route
schedules with the bottom line
being cost efficiency."

PAT computerizes
to cut service costs

The computerized runcuttinge
and scheduling system, known as
Rucus, will enable the schedule
department to quickly compare
all possible alternatives and pro-
duce the most effective schedules
in considerably less time and at
less expense,to PAT than the tra-
ditional manual method
requires, Millar said.

Hewsaid ‘the’ new system will
substantially increase productiv-
ity of PAT’s team of schedule
writers while cutting unnecessary
time out of scheduled trips.

=.i.‘....~;~ ‘u3€‘;1

Sodium in salt aggravates high
blood pressure in some people and
may cause fluid retention, which
strains the heart. As a result, low-

sodium diets are prescribed to treat .

hypertension. Excess pounds tend to
cause a rise in blood pressure levels
as well. Therefore, a low-calorie diet
with a regular exercise routine may
also be prescribed to reduce body
weight.

Many medications are available
to reduce high blood pressure. In
most cases, these drugs work with
minimal side effects. However, a
person with high blood pressure
may have to go through a trial
period before the physician finds a
medication or a combination of
medicines that work most
effectively.

Since medical science does not
understand what causes most cases
of high blood pressure, it is difficult
to prevent it. However, some con-
tributing factors —— excess weight,
lack of exercise or using too much
salt in your diet —— can be avoided.
Other factors such as age, race and
heredity, cannot be changed. Elderly
people, black Americans and those
with a family history of high blood
pressure are more likely to develop

It.
“ More Americans are having their

blood pressure checked and follow-
ing their doctor's recommendations
than ever before,“ Young con-
cluded. “But in order to continue
our success, we have to encourage
and maintain control among those
with known high blood pressure."

Runners sought for local race

The 1985 Greenfield Glide, a 5K cross-countrv run which traverses
the trails of Schenley Park, is being held on Sunday, June 9, from 9
a.m. to noon.

This cross-country race, which is sponsored by Citiparks, Y97 FM
radio, Domino's Pizza and the Greenfield Organization, is open to
individuals of all ages. Tunch Ilkin, offensive tackle for the Pittsburgh
Steelers, will officiate and pass out awards to the winners. The entry
fee is $6 for pre-registration and $7 the day of the race. Package
pick-up and late registration will be held at the Schenley Park Ice Rink
beginning at 7:30 a.m.

Applications can be picked up at the Citiparks office, 4th floor,
City/County Building; all western Pennsylvania Domino’s Pizza
stores; or the Greenfield Organization, 430 Greenfield Avenue.

T-shirts will be given to the first 500 registered runners. There will
also be'a post-race raffle for registered runners that will include $500
in prizes. Proceeds from the race will benefit Greenfield community
recreation programs.

Children/media conference

In today’s society, children’s issues are widely covered on talk
shows, news specials, documentaries, parenting columns and the like.
However, surprisingly little attention has been paid t-o the quality of
the coverage. Quality media coverage can be a valuable tool for
increasing public awareness and improving child-rearing practices,
but experts are often unaware, uninvolved and unskilled in dealing
with media issues. As a result, the public is barraged with a confusing
array of undocumented opinions, half-truths and fraudulent claims.
On June 14 and I5, the University of Pittsburgh will be hosting a
‘conference to bring together knowledgeable professionals, both in the
media and child development. They will share their different perspec-
tives toward the common end of making the media more responsible
and effective in providing information and advice about children.
For more information about the conference ‘on child development
in the media, call the Department of Psychology at 624-4524.

Shriners educate public

Shrine Awareness Day will be held on Saturday, June 1, at Station
Square when various marching units of the Syria Temple march in the
weekly Station Square Super Saturday Parade at 2:30 p.m. Short
movies will be shown throughout the day, and the Shrine clowns and
other units will provide entertainment. .

The -Shriners would like the public to know their hospitals for
crippled children, in completing 62 years of service, have cured over
297,000 crippled or burned children totally free of charge.

Symposium to motivate artists

Citiparks’ Arts in the Parks Program and the University of Pitts-

burgh Graduate School of Public Health will present a free sympo-

sium on health concerns for artists on June 15 and 16 at the Graduate
School of Public Health, 130 DeSoto Street in Oakland.

. The goal of the symposium is to motivate artists and craftsmen to
include safety in the creative process in order to control potential
health hazards of using wood, inks, solvents, photographic chemicals
and plastics.

Speakers include Monoma Rossol, president of the Center of Occu-
pational Hazards in New York City, and Dr. Nurten Esmen, editor of
Art Hazards and toxicologist and professor at Pitt’s Graduate School

of Public Health.

Dan Mottsman visited the Pittsburgh Folk Festi-
val last Saturday at the David Lawrence Convention
Center. The festival featured the culture of dozens of
nations in a three-da y celebration. Besides his cover

Myasthenia gravis victims learn
to cope with steps and stares

By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

“I started tripping over my own
two feet for no reason," Donna
Kalisek jokes, describing an expe-
rience she had when she was eight
years old. Sue Hudacheck hasa sim-
ilar explanation: “When I was a
freshman in high school, I started
falling down the stairs all the time.”
Both Donna and Sue were diag-
nosed as victims of myasthenia grav-
is, a chronic neuromuscular disease
characterized by abnormal weak-
nessof voluntary muscles.

Myasthenia gravis can affect
anyone at any age, but it especially
strikes young women between the
ages of 18 and 25. Symptoms are so
general —_— drooping eyelids, inabil-
ity to grasp a coffee cup, sudden
weakness in the legs ~ that MG
often goes undiagnosed or
misdiagnosed.

Kim suffers from MG, and for
two years, doctors referred her to
psychologists because they assumed
that her muscle weakness was a
result of emotional problems con-
cerning an early pregnancy. Other
cases have been misdiagnosed as
mononucleosis or eye problems.

“My little brother has dimples

‘when he smiles,” Donna recalls,

“and I used to have them, too.
Sometimes I really miss my
dimples.”

Because of weak facial muscles,
myasthenics often develop the habit
of resting their chin in their hands.
Chewing and swallowing can also be
difficult, so most myasthenics are
restricted to a diet of soft foods. By
the time Donna was l0‘, she was con-
fined to a wheelchair because of
weakness in her arms and legs. If
respiratory muscles weaken, hospi-
talization is mandatory for life sup-
port. Until three years ago, Donna
spent much of her time on a respira-

tor in Mercy Hospital.

MG is classified as an auto-
immune disease because the myas-
thenic’s antibodies attack the body
they are meant to protect.

The myasthenic’s body manufac-
tures antibodies" that destroy recep-
tor sites in muscles. Without these
receptor sites, the muscles cannot
receive signals from nerve endings,
which progressively weakens the
muscles. _

During the first few years of her
illness, Donna’s condition required
extra attention from her parents.

She remembers how her mother
wheeled her across the street to the
playground every day. “Most of the
rest of the time, I was stuck in the
house," she recalls.

Sue remembers the time she spent
with her family. “They‘ve been
great,” she said. “My brothers and
sisters used to drag me everywhere.

“My family never treated me dif-
ferently than they would anyone
else. In fact, I remember how my
little brother used to change the
channel on the TV when I was

was too weak to get up and change
the channel back. ‘If you want to
watch your show, change the chan-
nel yourself,‘ he’d say. Brothers are
like that, and mine were no
different.”

Donna grew up with four broth-
ers. “It always hurt me that I would
sit at home and watch my little
brother hop on his bike and drive
off,” she remembers. “There was a
porch swing hanging from a cherry
tree about 25 yards from our front

reached my limit. We learned the
hard way."

Donna was asked to leave school
in the fourth grade because the
administration felt that the school
was not equipped to accomodate her
handicap.

“I think they were afraid of it,” she‘
said. “I was isolated from my friends
as a result.” V

In eighth grade, she returned to a
school where the new open class-
room experiment used there fitted
Donna's needs — everything was on
one floor.

“ My teachers were really suppor-
tive,” she remembers. “They knew I
couldn’t «always carry those five-
pounders, so I was often late. I
missed between 50 and 80 days every
year because I couldn’t make it to

school.”
During the treatment, the myas-

thenic is hooked up to a machine

‘that draws out blood‘: separates the

infected plasma from the rest of the
blood and replaces it with a sterile
plasma substitute. The process can
last for hours at a time,and renewed
strength does not often occur until
one or two days later.

Almost every myasthenic also
undergoes a thymectomy, the surgi-
cal removal of the thymus gland. In
early life, the thymus is involved in
the development of the immune sys-
tem. A myasthenic’s thymus tends to
be abnormally large, and its removal
may lessen the severity of the
patient’s symptoms.

“I make sure to follow the doctor’s
order and do everything that I’m_

supposed to do," Sue said. “I try to
conserve my energy so I can do
things that I enjoy."

Donna has also adjusted to her
handicap. “I grew up learning how
to live with my limitations,"she said.
“But sometimes I'm a little self-
conscious around other people. It's
hard to associate with some of them
because you know they want to ask
you something about MG. They see
the disease instead of me."

Sue has also dealt with people
who judge her because of her han-
dicap. “All I want is a chance,” she
said. ‘‘I’m just as capable as anyone
else.”

Now 28, Sue works as an assistant
coordinator at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Pittsburgh. At 26,
Donna works three days a week at
the Myasthenia Gravis Association
of Mercy Hospital, answering tele-
phones, typing materials and doing
other clerical work.

“I don’t know what I’d do if I
didn’t have (this job)," Donna said.
“The people here have real under-
standing and no pity.”

Myasthenia gravis has had emo-
tional as well as physical ramifica-
tions for Donna. Having adjusted to
her physical limitations, she is learn-
ing to deal with the emotional effects
of her handicap.

“I used to think of life as a big
black tunnel with no light at the
end,” she said. “But now Ijust think
about getting to the next hour or the
next day. Its not bravery or hero-
ism. lt_’s su_rvivaI._”

Peace, war, and Farrakhan

In his classic work, “The Devil’s
Dictionary," Ambrose Bierce
defined impiety as “your lack of
respect for my deity." In a similar
vein, members of the peace move-
ment seem to define apathy as “your
failure to jump on my bandwagon"
(“Economy and apathy hinder local
peace movement," The Pitt News,
May 22, I985).

It’s not that we “don’t care” or
“want war”; we just don’t think a
pre-emptive surrender will prevent
one. Some of us see a double stan-
dard at work: Why do people who
don’t bat an eye at l00,000 Soviet
troops in Afghanistan get so upset
over 55 American advisors in El Sal-
vador? They don’t mind Soviet SS-
205 and ASAT tests, so why do they
object to our cruise missiles and
“Star Wars”? Why do they scream
“racist genocide” and “American
imperialism” when we help those
who resist Soviet-sponsored aggres-
sion in Grenada and Nicaragua?

Moreover, some of us know who
Neville Chamberlain was, and we
couldn’t help wondering if Walter
Mondale were his reincarnation.
And some of us know a similar peace
movement which existed before
World War II convinced Hitler that
the Western democracies lacked the
will to resist him. According to Con-
gressman William Dornan, the
Soviets never run a simulation of
World War III with an “American
attacks the Soviet Union” scenario
— unlike the peace movement, the
Soviets know who’s going to start

. the next war.

Finally, according to the Defense
Department’s 1984 annual report,
the Soviets outnumber NATO two
to one in tanks, three to one in other
armored vehicles, nine to one in
artillery and rocket launchers and
seven to one in ballistic missile sub-
marines, Perhaps these people are
protesting against the wrong
government!

Peace movement members who
brand those not in their ranks as
“warmongers” are no different from
McCarthyists who defined com-
munists as anyone who disagreed
with them. These well—meaning (but
quite naive) people have not grasped
the paradox George Washington so
eloquently expressed: If you want to
have peace, you must be prepared
for war.

Louis Farrakhan‘s invitation and
acceptance to speak at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is quite a misfor-
tune for a number of reasons. First,
those in the media covering the
upcoming event have incorrectly
isolated the controversy into a
purely black-Jewish issue, This
belief is farthest from the truth.
Shortly after the SGB decision to
allocate funds for
appearance, an ad-hoc committee of
concerned students was formed.
This committee came about to plan
peaceful and non-interfering meas-

ures to offset Farrakhan‘s delusion ,

of hatred and bigotry. There are as
many Gentiles as there are Jews who
have joined this committee. Unfor-
tunately, it is only natural for those
not knowing to isolate the issue.
Farrakhan‘s racist remarks have
been isolated to those who uphold
the Jewish faith, at least those which
have been published.

However, in a time of solid, cur-
rent black-Jewish dialogue, it is
very, very dangerous for those ofthe
media to report the event of Farra-

ing Center, which provides various ?

khan's appearance as black vs. Jew-
ish. I do not believe that any member
of the Black Action Society holds
anti-Semitic sentiment. I can assure
you that the ad-hoc committee feels

no anti-black sentiment at all.
Black-Jewish dialogue must con-
-tinue on the scale it is’ currently on,
and under‘ no circumstances nor
excuses on either side must it break
down. The Pitt media appears deter-
mined to break the dialogue and
create tensions where there are none.

Secondly, although in the spirit of
academia and constitutional rights
(it is important for all of us to recog-
nize free speech as an educational
experience), must bigotry, separa-
tism and racism be permitted to
representritself on this or any other
campus? Clearly, there is no answer
to this question, so the question
must be altered. That is, is it safe for
Rev. Farrakhan to come here to
speak? Surely, the armed body
guards who will accompany Rev.
Farrakhan do not seem to think so.
Likewise, those who feel threatened
by his blatant racist beliefs do not
think so either. This issue must be
addressed, and it must be addressed
now. It scares me to think of the

possible violence that could occur.

on this campus if only a few
hotheads on either side decide to
take it upon themselves to express
their views in a violent manner.
Given the attention Farrakhan‘s
appearance has been given so far, it
won’t matter how large ofa security
force is brought here to protect him,
or those who choose to protest his
appearance. Violence might be
imminent.

Thirdly, it is unfortunate that the
university administration has not
taken a stand one way or the other.
The Office of Student Affairs
appears highly disinterested, and the
higher powers-that-be refuse to get
involved, too. Either the administra-
tion must recognize that an eruption
of opposite opinions is extremely
possible, and do something about it,
or they must publicly condemn Far-
rakhan‘s beliefs and step in to stop
his appearance here. Whatever the
administration chooses to do, even if
it is nothing at all, it will be very
interesting to watch and see how the
administration will act, probably in
its first major socio-dilemma since
the 1960s.

Counseling cuts

In part of an attempt to use
resources more wisely, university
officials recently decided to make
some personnel and budgetary cuts
in the support services available to
students. For example, the Counsel-

Salvatore

PUCC

“Heads will Turn”

sonal and career counseling, has

 ‘r

  

become a target for draconian

reductions.

These cuts are appalling and dan- "

gerous. To operate smoothly_ and ;,
efficiently, an institution of higher :-

learning must provide more than

 

professors and classrooms. Clearly 
the Counseling Center is an integral 
part of the University of Pittsburgh. 

It has helped keep many students in 
school who might otherwise have

left. Moreover the Counseling Cen-
ter has helped ease the pain and
anguish of countless other students
during their stay here. In addition,
the career counselors have assisted
thousands of students in the process

 

E
ii
:-

 

of selecting and preparing for their 
future careers. Consequently, it is ;
also a symbiotic part ofthe universi- 
ty’s placement services. Finally, the 
Career Information Center is said to 
be among the best in the country. 3
These services cannot be cut without ‘I

the reputation of the university.

Students must voice their objec- ;
tions to these measures as a direct 

- jeopardizing the health and welfare 
of the student body, not to mention 

 

 

assault on their interests. Faculty 
and staff must oppose this m1s- 

guided undertaking, which repre-E
sents a deterioration of the institu- f
tional health of their employer, as j
well as increased pressures on their i

jobs. A united front of students.

faculty and staff can successfully re- 5.

 

sist further reductions in the support 

services.

More love and desperation

By Dolores Rice
Staff Writer

The topic is love. Romantics
yearn for it,'cynics criticize it and
the lonely die for it. Love is, of
course, an emotion. So it is
impossible to define it. Choose
Me does not attempt to define
love nor give an idealized Harle-
quin fairy tale, because love is
confusing and is never the same
for two people, even for two peo-
ple involved with each other.
Director/writer Alan Rudolph
exposes this thing called love
and its confusion through three
wonderfully complex charac-
ters. Eve (Lesley Ann Warren
of Victor, Victoria and A Night
In Heaven) never has a problem
ﬁnding men. But finding love?
That’s another story — it’s the
story behind Choose Me.

Eve owns a bar and lounge
appropriately named Eve’s
Place. She is familiar with the
neighborhood hookers since she
at one time walked alongside
them. She is also quite familiar

with the men who frequent the.

bar - and whom she collects.
Early on, sex, for Eve, was not
associated with love. She was
very independent and seemed
strong and in control. She
and
believed that the little tingle of
excitement she got when she met
someoneispecial was not limited
to one person. How could she get
involved when, right around the
next corner, there’ll be another
man inspiring another tingle?
Maybe Dr. Nancy Love
(Genevieve Bujold, most
recently seen in Monsignor and
Tightrope) can provide an
answer. Dr. Love operates the
Love Line, the city‘s most popu-
lar radio talk show. Dr. Love(or
Ann, which is her cover name) is

    

   

Eve (Lesley A Warr) ad key (Keith Ca7ra-

._ dine) in_ Choose’N\e.
by far the most interesting char-
acter in Choose Me. Her psy-
chology on the air helps
thousands of the lovelorn. But
she herself is suffering from too
much book knowledge instead
of real physical life experience.
She is so far away from the prob-
lems she hears on the other end

of the line that she can offer de-

tached analvtical advice. The_

confusion of love, passion and
jealousy are laid out simply by
Dr. Love since no one has yet
gotten through her exterior to
spark such feelings.

Micky (Keith Carradine of
Nashville and more recently
Maria is Lovers) plays a traveling
man who has this thing about
marriage. He only kisses girls
he’d marry, but he wants to
marry every one of them. But
deep down, he needs security in
his life. So Micky escapes from
the veteran’s hospital in search
of some happier times — times
he found at Eve’s Place years
ago.

Choose Me is desperate as all
three characters try to under-

stand, qualify and search for
love. The film illuminates the
fact that’ love is never simple or
always fair, only that it's
essential.

Euryth mics

The sound of
disappointment 2

BE YOURSELF TONIGHT
The Eurythmics
RCA

Can an imitation ever match
its ideal? I don’t think so. Sure,
it’ll look the same, and maybe
it’ll even sound the same. Some-

thing’s missing — inspiration,
feeling, emotion. OK, l’ll say it
—— soul!

Case in point: the Eurythmics’
latest release, Be Yourself

Tonight (contradiction?). Don’t
think I’m being too harsh. l’ll
agree, technically, that it’s all
there. Its perfect, but there’sjust
no guts. The music on this record
is just as steely cold as Annie
Lennox’s face on the front ofthe
sleeve.

Everything that was fascinat-
ing about songs like “Sweet
Dreams” and “Here Comes the
Rain” is gone (with the excep-

P tion of “Conditioned Soul” as is

everything that was unique to
the Eurythmics. What we have
here is some synth-pop with all
the heart and soul of a recent
Spandau Ballet single.

Lennox and collaborator
Dave Stewart must have been

    

Annie Lennox an
avid, Stuart

aware of their shortcomings
going into this record. Why else
would they enlist the likes ofthe
Heartbreakers (minus Tom
Petty), Stevie Wonder, Elyis
Costello and (vtépuld you
believe?) Aretha Franklin? "‘“

There’s nothing wrong with
guest stars when used to good
effect. However, the only pur-
pose these cameo appearances
serve is to contrast with Lennox
and Stewart, exposing the pair
as less than the genuine article.

MICHAEL FAY.

The Genesis of the 80s. 

RED 7
Red 7'
RCA

The operative word here is
“pretension.” Red 7 swearby it.
They want to be Genesis so badly
that occasionally,‘ on their better
songs (“Less than Perfect,”
“Heartbeat” and “This Dark
Hour”), they almost pull it off. I
suppose their attitude is “Well,
no one else seems to be Genesis
right now, so why not us?”

Lead singer Gene Stashuk is a
better-than-average vocalist,
and he does the best Peter
Gabriel this side of Phil Collins.
(In fact, Stashuk sounds so
much like Gabriel that it's down-
right spooky.) The band is filled
out by keyboardist Michael
Becker — did someone say Keith
Emerson? -— and drummer Paul

Revelli. V

Red 7’s ’70s art-rock fixations
might not be so inexcusable if
they hadn’t gone so far as to
actually enlist Mike Rutherford
(of Genesis) to produce their
album.

The final product, however, is
a" cold, poorly-conceived
(though ﬂawlessly executed) trip
through utter tedium. At their
best, Genesis could create a cer-
tain warmth — a sense of
humanity that cut through all
the high-tech twiddling; Red 7,
on the other hand, are frigid and

« unyielding, and even the album’s

best song. “Heartbeat,” is no
exception. Recently used as
background music on an episode
of NBC-TV’s “Miami Vice,” the
song has a chilly, spare atmos-
phere that would make good

‘i Use You,”

night-driving music. It has an
authentically lonely feel, helped
along by Rutherford’s echo-
chamber production. ,
The rest of the record is not as
successful. “No Sorry” has lath
annoying l-8 chant for a chorus
and nothing resembling an inter-
esting chord change. “Let Me
the records sole
attempt at directly addressing
sexuality, is embarrassingly bad
(‘Could 1 interest you in sucking
on my big toe?’ Really?!).
Given a healthy dose of humil-
ity, Red 7 could emerge one day

. . . . . .‘G;-
as an interesting, if limited, are-*‘

pop band. For the present,
though, they have little to offer
anyone who doesn’t bitterly miss
the ’70s, Hypnosis album sleeve
designs and bell-bottom jeans.

Harvey Mi

By Michael Selz
Staff Writer

Harvey Milk’s assassination in
1978 didn’t generate the sweeping
nationwide grief and outrage that
late 1960s assassinations did. Robert
Kennedy and Martin Luther King
were more visible on the national
level. They weren’t gay, either. All
the more reason to see The Times of
Harvey Milk this weekend. It is not

ﬂthe story of a nice guy who meets

tragedy. It is the story of a tragic
hero. And beyond the citizens of San
Francisco, not a lot of people
remember anything about this story,-
save the lingering, whimsical phrase,
“The Twinkies defense."

Documentaries are seldom as
riveting or emotionally draining as
narrative film. This film, the winner
of the 1984 Academy Award for Best
Documentary, might make you feel
as though you’ve been run over by a

truck.

Narrated by playwright/actor
Harvey Fierstein, The Times 0fHar-

’ groups,

vey Milk combines arresting inter-
views with Milk’s colleagues and
friends, with abundant news footage
to allow viewers to feel as though
they know the man and the extraor-
dinary climate for social change that
he catalyzed.

A long-haired gay owner of a
camera store, Harvey Milk ran for
San Francisco’s Board of Supervi-
sors (the equivalent of our city coun-
cil) three times between 1973 and
1978, losing each time. He had sev-
eral things going for him, though.
lrrepressible spunk and a sense of
humor were combined with a
shrewd political savvy. More impor-
tantly, his political base extended
beyond the confines of San Francis-
co’s gay and lesbian community to
other minorities, neighborhood
rank and file union
members and the aged.

When San Francisco’s progres-
sive Mayor George Moscone

changed the election laws to allow .
‘ the election of officials by their own

districts instead of city-wide, Harvey
Milk had the demographics he
needed. In 1978, at 47, he was
elected, making him the first openly

‘ii.

ENTERTAINMENT/THE PITT NEWS SUMMER MAGAZINE/ PAGE 9

    

-lilarfvey Mi0<

gay city official in the history of the
U.S. Also elected were the first Chi-
nese American, the first black
woman and the first women’s rights
advocate to serve on the San Fran-
cisco Board of Supervisors.

Dan White, a fireman in a blue-
collar neighborhood, was elected,

too. He was a “different kind of

neighborhood populist" who stood A

for old-fashioned values and
pledged “not to be forced out of San
Francisco by splinter groups of radi-
cals, social deviates and incorrigi-
bles.” His was the only dissenting
vote for Milk‘s Gay Rights Bill.
Months later, he became Milk’s and
Moscone‘s murderer.

Proposition 6, proposed by Cali-
fornia Senator John Briggs, would
have allowed the firing of all gay
teachers. Harvey Milklattracted
national attention for the first time
with his dogged and ultimately suc-
cessful attack on the proposition.
Four days after the Briggs defeat,
White resigned from the board of
supervisors but a week later asked
for his job back. When he learned
that he was to be refused, he climbed
through a window in City Hall (in
order to bypass the metal detectors
at the door) and went first to the
mayor’s office, then to that of his
rival Harvey Milk —— shooting each
of them, in turn, in the head.

The candlelight march of 45,000
people and the bloody riot at City
Hall following the sentencing of

k: a nice guy turnedtragic hero

White are depicted in powerful news
media footage. White was released
from prison after serving five years
for voluntary manslaughter in Janu-
ary 1984, having received no psychi-
atric treatment whatsoever.

At several points during the ﬁlm,
one is tempted to balk at the too
obvious martyring of the man. The
people interviewed were all so pas-
sionate in their love and commit-
ment to him. There was his
prophetic reference to the danger of
the incumbent to his position: “It
could happen anyplace, anywhere,
anytime, and I’m just not gonna
worry about it.” Sure, every assassi-
nated political figure espouses that
cheery fatalism. But the fact that
we’ve seen and heard this before
doesn’t diminish the power of the
film. Another good and powerful
man has been denied us.

This movie must be seen notjust
because it portrays a heroic man, but
also for what it says about ourjus-
tice system. One supporter said that
he thought White would have gotten
a life sentence if he’d only killed the
mayor. its something to think
about.

A lot of people thought that last
year's Pitt football season was a dis-
aster. Things don’t get any easier -—
on Sept. I4 the Panthers will travel
to Ohio State to challenge the
Buckeyes.

The Buckeyes boast this year's
odds on favorite for the Heisman

Trophy, tailback Keith Byars. Pitt ‘

fans will best remember Byars for
what he did against Pitt in the 1984
Fiesta Bowl. Byars’ 99-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown proved to be
an important play in" Ohio State's
come from behind victory over Pitt.

Since those days, Byars has
become even more inﬂuential to the
Ohio State attack. Last year, Byars
led the nation in rushing with 1,655
yards, scored 23 touchdowns and
was named the 1984 Big Ten Player
of the Year. He also finished second
to Doug Flutie in the Heisman vot-
ing, and is considered by many to be
the premier running back in the
nation. V

Byars stands at 6-2, 235 pounds,
but,-he can put on the speed when-
ever he wants to. He has been timed
at 4.45 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
Who was his boyhood idol? Who
else! Archie Griffin, the last Ohio
State player to win the Heisman
Trophy.

Acquitted

Duquesne players
found not guilty

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

A jury of 12 men and women
handed down a verdict of “not
guilty” in the rape trial of three
Duquesne University basketball
players yesterday. Acquitted on
all charges were sophomores
Eric Compton, Gregory Harri-..
son and Ronnie Stevenson. The
three, along with junior Emmett
Sellers, whose trial will begin on
Monday, were accused of the
rape of a Wilma Boyd Career
School student in oneof the resi-
dence halls at the university last
summer. .

Greg Harrison

The jury deliberated for only
one hour before delivering the
final verdict. Although the three
athletes seemingly have beaten
the rap, the Duquesne University
Judicial Board still stands
between them and their rein-
statement to the basketball team.

According to Duquesne offi-
cials, the university will wait for
the outcome of Sellers’ trial
before the students are brought
in front of the judicial board.
Although Sellers is being tried
separately from the other three in
criminal court, all four will be
brought infront of the university
judicial board together.

R . St Sellers was developing. into
Onme evenson . one of the premier players in the
end of his sophomore year, but
the 6-3 guard_from Newark, N.J.,
along with Stevenson, Compton
and Harrison, were forced to sit
out last season after the charges
were filed.

Stevenson, a 6-6 forward from
Langley High School, and Harri-
son, a 6-6 forward from Lynn,
Mass. were both part-time start-
ers during their freshman year.

0 Compton, a 6-1 guard from
Long Beach, N.Y. saw only
limited action.

Duquesne officials would not
comment on the chances of
Sellers, Compton, Harrison and
Stevenson being members ofthe
Duquesne basketball team for
the I985-86 season.
