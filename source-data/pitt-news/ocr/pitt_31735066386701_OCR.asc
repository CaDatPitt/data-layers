Chancellor
O'Connor
names Haley
director of  
public affairs

By Christine Hanna
Managing Editor

A six-month long search for the
University of Pittsburgh executive director
of public affairs, a newly created position,
has ended.

Thursday, Chancellor _I. Dennis
O’Connor appointed Dr. Leon Haley, a Pitt
alumnus and former Pitt administrator.

As executive director, Haley will be
responsible for Pitt’s community relations
and media relations activities, and he will
answer to O’Connor.

“Leon Haley has an honest affinity for
the academic environment,” O’Connor
said. “He understands Pitt and the various
constituencies that comprise the universi-
ty.”

Haley served for nine years as president
and chief executive officer of the Urban
League of Pittsburgh, Inc., the nation’s
third largest urban league organization.

“Dr. Haley is an extremely well-known
and respected leader in Pittsburglfs corpo-
rate and civic communities. He is excited
about the prospect of returning to the uni-
versity, and I am delighted that he will be
part of the Pitt family again,” said
O’Connor.

Before joining the Urban League, Haley
was acting dean of Pitt’s Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs from
1984 to 1985 and associate dean and asso-
ciate professor of GSPIA from 1975 to
1984.

Between 1970 and 1974, Haley served in
various academic and administrative posi-
tions in Pitt’s School of Social Work,
including chair of the Juvenile and
Criminal Justice Program.

Haley has also taught at Lincoln
University in Jefferson City, Mo.; Fort
Valley State College in Fort Valley, Ga. and
Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.

Haley received his bachelor’s degree in

The debate
continues.
Which student
gets more for
their money -

CAS or CGS?

By Lisa DiMeno
Staff Writer

Deborah Vidmar will gradu-
ate from Pitt in April with a legal
studies degree from the College
of General Studies.

Jennifer Vernet will graduate
from Pitt in June with a degree
in English writing and commu-

nications from the College of
Arts and Science.

Both students will receive
degrees from the University of
Pittsburgh next year, but from
different undergraduate col-
leges. The majors of both stu-
dents are completely different,
but is the quality of education in
both colleges the same?

“It should be the same
because it is the same faculty
and the same departments that
provide us with the faculty,”
CGS Dean John Bolvin said.

CAS provides for the majority
of undergraduates at the
University of Pittsburgh with
about 10,000 students enrolled.
CGS provides classes for mostly

nontraditionally-aged students,
full-time and part-time, who
also work, have families, etc.
CGS has roughly half as many
students as CAS.

But in a sense, comparing
CAS and CGS is like comparing
an apple to an orange. They are
separate entities that are target-
ed at very different types of stu-
dents. Also, CGS is in the
process of combating the image
of being a night school and a
school that isn’t as academically
strong as CAS.

On the other hand, tuition for
CAS and CGS is the same.
Though the type and size of the
student populations of both
schools differ greatly, the

degrees are similar and the stu-
dents are paying the same
amount for classes.

In comparing a Bachelor of
Arts from CAS and a Bachelor of
Arts from CGS, CAS Dean Mary
Briscoe said that a basic com-
parison is not that easy.

“The question is more compli-
cated than it is simple. First of
all, the admission policies are
different. CAS has higher acade-
mic requirements. We also
have more full-time faculty,”
Briscoe: said.

Bolvin said there are some
differences in the general- edu-
cation requirements.

“Some of our requirements
are geared more toward the

non-traditional students as tc
what we believe that they need
compared to what the tradition-
al students might need,” he
said.

CGS has a lotof part-tirne stu-
dents, and Bolvin said it is
impossible to compare their
academic criteria to that of the
full-time CAS student.

“lWithl the part-tirne student,
if they’ve been out of school
three years or more, we pay
almost no attention to college
boards. We pay attention to
what they have done in the
three years,” Bolvin said.

Psychology professor Donald
McBurney said that he thinks

I-SGB starts to work on campaign promises

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

1994 has begun, and along with frigid
temperatures the new year brings in an
excited Student Government Board that is
ready to go forth on many new projects.

“We have been working real hard, and it
looks like it will be a real productive year,"
said President Pro Tempore Eli’/.abeth
Mania.

One of the boards main goals this term is
to begin improving the. communication
between themselves and the student body.
A step in that direction, according to Mania,
is the Student Brief that will be appearing
monthly in Hie /’i/I Ne11»‘s.

Mariia said the brief would be on the
back page and the first half will be devoted
to individual reports from the board mem-

bers.

The second half will be a "calendar listing
upcoming events from student groups,”
according to Mania.

A project that the entire board is working
on is getting an official statement on the
university’s possible decision to reinvest in
South Africa.

According to board member Deena
Buchanan, SGB is “contacting national and
international organi‘/.ations like the United
Nations." to get the most reliable informa-
tion before making a statement on the rein-
vestment plan. 4

Board member Heath Golden, along witl
Mania, is working on a project to improve
the choice dollars system at Pitt.

They are trying to get a debit card that
will enable students to use choice dollars in
taxi cabs. local drugstores and other

Oakland businesses. The current choice
dollars program can only be used to pur-
chase food.

The SGB listened to Sacha Layos, the
Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Alliance co—presi—
dent, speak about Resolution 6, signed by
last year’s SGB. The resolution supports
ROTC and the programs it sponsors.

“We are definitely opposed to this resolu-
tion,” Layos said.

Layos asked the board for an official
response to this resolution.

Another project that the board worked on
was researching the 1987 student activity
fee increase so they can recommend a deci-
sion to the Board of Trustees about increas-
ing the student activity fee.

The next SGB meeting will be held on
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in 624 \X’/illiam Pitt
Union.

degrees in CAS and CGS are
comparable.

“I think that most instructors,
at leastspeaking for myself. use
the same standards in both CAS
and CGS," McBumey said.

Mcliurney also said that
though the curriculum isn’t

identical, over the years CGS

has been revised so that it is, for
the most part, parallel to CAS.

"In terms of the courses for
the degree, they’re very similar
in terms of their rigor,“ he said.

As a student in CAS, Vernet
said she is not exactly sure of
any differences between the
two colleges.

“I don’t really think there is a
difference, because a lot of CGS
students are in the same courses
that I am, so I don’t really think
there is a difference difficulty-
wise, maybe structure-wise; I’m
not sure,” Vernet said.

The General Education
Curriculum in CAS and the
Distribution of Studies in CGS
are similar to each other.

Both colleges have basically
the same writing, math and
quantitative formal reasoning
requirements. lioth colleges
also ask for classes that fulfill
requirements in humanities,
social sciences and natural sci-
ence.

CAS requires three “foreign
culture requirements,” including
one. non—western foreign cul-
ture requirement. Similarly, CGS
requires six to 10 credits to ful-

fill "international perspective
requirements."

The big difference is that CAS
has a foreign language require-
ment and CGS doesn’t.

"Our requirements are really
geared toward the more mature
adult and we have found that if
the adult needs a foreign lan-
guage, they are going to get it,"
Bolvin said.

CGS does, however, have a
public-speaking requirement.
Bolvin said preparing for a
speech gives you probably the
most basic skills for research
that you need.

Vidmar switched from CAS to
CGS because CGS offered a
degree in legal studies. She
pointed out a difference outside
of the requirements.

“CGS requirements are slight-
ly different than CAS require-
ments, but the difference in
education comes more from the
in—classroom experience,"
Vidmar said.

Professor Mcliurney said he
agrees that the classroom situa-
tions differ. He doesn’t teach in
CGS as much as CAS, but said
he oftentimes likes teaching
CGS better.

“Because the students are
often more mature, they have
more experiences that they can
bring to the class. And they
make the classroom situation
richer because of that,”
Mcl3urney said.

English professor Richard
Tobias, who has been at Pitt for
37 years, also noted that CGS

W‘ﬂ““-""“‘-"I-"-"E"-1"”-"'-‘F“'-"W students can bring a different

attitude. to class.

“CGS students have a certain
freshness and eagerness that
ordinary freshman don’t have,”
Tobias said.

Dean Briscoe said that one of
the main differences between
the degrees of CAS and CGS is
the fact that CAS has more full-

H3PPY H0111‘ time faculty. Dean Bolvin has

1125- B0“ 9lSl- M011‘Th111'S ° 4'6‘ been on record for 10 years say-
Iﬁeln. 1L1.1I..1I..1I..1..1I..‘1..'1..1.1IeI».‘i

ing that he feels CGS does not
receive a proper balance of reg-
ular full—time faculty, part-time
faculty and graduate student
faculty.

“The data shows that CAS is
assigned by some departments
more of their full-time faculty
than CGS, and that has been a
problem that I have been trying
to address as well as my prede-
cessors," Bolvin said.

Bolvin admits that although
some of the adjunct faculty
might be better than the full-
time faculty, he would still like
to see more regular faculty.

“That’s what the students are
coming for,” he said.

McBurney also recognizes the
faculty situation as being a
problem for CGS, but not one
that is too serious.

“CGS students are not going
to see as many full—time profes-
sors who are active in research
or in their field. But that is only
one indicator of quality,” he
said.

Mcl3urney said he is con-
vinced that graduate students
do just as well or sometimes
better than professors as teach-

‘ ers.

On the other hand, Professor
Tobias said that students in CAS
and CGS receive “completely
different educations” as a result
of less full-time faculty in CGS.

“Of course, anybody in the
university with any clout is
going to say to the administra-
tion that they don’t want to
teach at night. This results in
introductory courses in CGS
that aren’t coming up to the
general status,” Tobias said.

Tobias went on to say that
CGS students do get more full-
time faculty as they progress
through CGS.

ences in registration, advising

differences in requirements and
faculty.

Both students registered for
this semester on the first day
available for seniors to do so.
Vernet got in line at 6 a.m. and
waited two hours for the regis-
tration office in Thackeray Hall
to open. She did this in an effort
to make sure she got all of the
classes she needed.

“A lot of times I registered the
first day, but not until 11:00 or
12:00, and a lot of classes that I
wanted were closed,” she said.

Vernet said that if you register
during the first couple of days
of registration you are guaran-
teed to wait in line. She said if
you wait a few weeks, the line
isn’t that long, but then most of
the classes you need will be
closed.

“No matter what you go into
Thackeray for, you have to wait
in line. I’m sure there has got to
be a better way to do it,” Vernet
said.

Vidmar recalls the “hellish
three—hour waits in line” in
Thackeray Hall as a CAS stu-
dent. As a CGS student, Vidmar
said she never once stood in
line. I

“I registered on the first day
for seniors, it took me 10 min-
Lites,” she said.

CGS students can register dur-
ing evenings and on Saturdays
as well as during weekdays.
Bolvin .-said inregard to registra-
tion, advising, admissions and
financial aid, the general atti-
tude of the CGS staff is to be
student-oriented.

“The design is to get busy
people in and get busy people
out, in a way that is most bene-
ficial to them,” Bolvin said.

Vernet pointed out that a lot
of CAS students also work dur-
ing the week.

“Evening registration is some-
thing that CAS should look
into,” she said.

CGS students are also able to

register without an advisors sig-
nature. Bolvin said this policy is
based on the expectations of
the typically- older student.

All CAS students are required
to have an advisor"s signature to
register for classes.

“We think it is important for
students to be advised,” Briscoe
said.

Vernet said she would be
interested in seeing CAS advis-
ing adopt the no—signature poli-
cy, but only for upperclass stu-
dents.

“Certainly anything that
would make the process a little

I easier on the students is worth-

while," Vernet said.

While Briscoe said she thinks
it is important for students to be
advised, some CAS students are
unhappy with having graduate
student advisors before they
declare a major. CAS students
sometimes have several gradu-
ate student advisors before they
receive an advisor in their cho-
sen field of study.

“I myself did not have the
unfortunate experience that I’ve
seen my roommates go
through, having been advised
by one advisor to take a course,
only to then have a new advi-
sor, because the first one had
graduated, and then be told that
the class they had taken does
indeed not fit the requirement
they thought it did,” Vidmar
said.

Vidmar pointed out that CGS
has a permanent full—time advis-
ing staff that has no graduate
students on staff.

Vidmar and Vernet both
strongly voiced their opinion
about the issue of the dean’s
list. CAS students need a 5.5
grade—point average to make
the CAS dean’s list, while CGS
students need a 3.25 to make
their dean’s list.

eight inches on the city and its
surroundings.

“It has been considerably
above average in snowfall,”
Davis said. “We’re only half into
January, and we usually get a
lot of snow in February and
March.”

With high temperatures
expected to range from nega-
tive 5 to 5 degrees on Tuesday
and Wednesday, and more
snow on the way, Davis said
that students who have to go
outside between classes or to
run errands should keep all
exposed skin areas covered and
dress warmly.

“You should dress in layers
rather than one big heavy coat,”
Davis said.

This allows air to circulate
between the layers. Students
should also wear mittens
instead of gloves if possible
because they are warmer,
according to Davis.

Two students who left their
warm Florida homes several

years ago to attend Pitt have
somewhat different views on
one of the coldest and wettest
winters they’ve experienced
since they’ve been here.

“I hate the snow,” junior
Christy Knobloch said. “This
really makes me appreciate the
South.”

Knobloch said when she was
home, temperatures were in the
60s and 70s.

But Pitt senior Marni
Lichstrahl said even though
recent temperatures and snow-
fall have been the worst of her
four winters at Pitt, she still likes
living here.

“I lived in Florida for 20 years
and I got very sick of [the
weatherl,” Lichstrahl said.

“It got very tedious and
monotonous. I don’t mind the
cold weather  and the snow is
very beautiful. It never snows
where I from.”

“I came to Pitt by choice,”
Lichstrahl said, “but sometimes I
don’t know what I was think-
ing.”

required to do the same amount of work. So,
the requirements to make dean’s list shou1c1n’t
be any different if one person is a CAS student
and the other is from CGS,” Vernet said.

Vidrnar said she is also against the existence
of different dean’s list requirements.

She said that CGS should also have 5.5 be
the cut-off, because people can otherwise
make that slur against CGS.

“People can say ‘You can make dean’s list
easier in CGS.’ As far a"s“I’rn concerned, that
is the only legitimate, obvious example
that I can see to be used against us,” Vidmar
said. .

Part—time CGS students need a 5.25 while
carrying 12 credits in order to make the dean’s
list. Bolvin said he just wants to reward peo-
ple who do well.

"So far there has been no need to change it.
Mary [Briscoel may have found something in
the grading and such that 5.5 is what she
wants. I’1n comfortable with 3.25,” Bolvin
said.

What does Bolvin tell potential employers

of Pitt students when they ask the difference
between CAS and CGS students?

‘‘I tell them the majors are the same, the
basic content of both liberal arts degrees are
the same and they are both University of
Pittsburgh ldegreesl,” Bolvin said.

Bolvin said because of maturity and experi-
ence, CGS students have an advantage with
employers. He also pointed out an advantage
to coming from CAS.

“CAS students were a student first, and had
other responsibilities second, and that may
give them some advantage. To me though it
doesn’t,” he said.

McBur'ney said he noticed a trend that could
affect a comparison of the two undergraduate
colleges.

“There are more traditional-age part-time
students in CGS now. So, the difference
between CAS and CGS is breaking down and I
think maybe sometime in the future we may
see that the distinction between the two col-
leges doesn’t make any sense anymore. Not
only in the image, but in actual structural
organization,” he said.

having sex in the book stacks.
Called “an Ohio State tradition”
by one student and “a thrilling

officials are determined tostop
the act.

The stacks consist of nine
dimly lit floors in the library
which seem to encourage
sex, according to one library
official.

He said the library is now

A Harlem hotel room set the scene for
the confrontation between King and
Malcolm.

Within a week of the setting, Malcolm
would be assassinated, and within three
years, King would also be murdered by
an assassin.

In this assimilated historic moment the
audience becomes privy to what might
have been, according to the program's
prologue. '

"The play examined both their public
and private lives: the clash of ideas and
tactics for the advancement of freedom,
but also the humanity of two devout
men of faith, loving fathers and hus-
bands, and leaders willing to lay down

their lives for the cause of justice,”
according to members of the Black
Action Society.

Programming director Rinaldo
Washington said he was impressed with
the play.

“lThe play] was a great commemora-
tion and [the actors] got their point
across. It was fairly realistic how they
upheld their own beliefs and adhered to
their Christian and Muslim faith,”
Washington said.

Audience member Brian Bolton said,
“It was a very concise piece. For those
who don’t know much about Malcolm X
and Dr. King, it was educational. The
play showed a mutual respect between
these two people who had two different
approaches for civil rights for blacks.”

Laws can't change attitudes

On Jan. 15, federal authorities began moving four
black families into Vidor, TX. The families were
brought in under armed guard. Providing fair housing
shouldn’t be a military operation. but the moving was
described as "an operation, carried out before dawn
under the cover of darkness."
Yo)‘/e Times, Vidor has not had a permanent black resi-
dent since the.1920s.

The new residents had volunteered to move in
because public housing is scarce in other areas which
are predominantly black. The Department of Housing
and Urban Development has paid off—duty Vidor police
officers to guard the housing complex for an indefinite
amount of time. '

Wait a minute, isn’t this 1994? Aren’t we living in a
fair and egalitarian society? Did somebody miss the “I
have a Dream” speech?

Apparently the American ideal hasn’t reached all
parts of the country; it probably hasn’t reached all the
parts of the room in which you’re reading this right
now. The families are not the first blacks who have
attempted to take up residence in Vidor in recent
months.

Earlier, four other black families moved out because
of what they described as unremitting hostility from the
residents. Although no one was physically injured, they
were subjected to racial slurs and verbal abuse from
passing cars.

After they had left, a Mississippi white supremacist
group held a Victory for Vidor parade down the main
street of Vidor.

Regardless of who sponsored the parade, the resi-

dents of Vidor have created a hostile atmosphere

which caused the earlier attempts at integration to fail.
The residents of this town have complained that out-
side agitators from such groups as the Ku Klux Klan
have precipitated the problem.

While it would be a gross injustice to say that all the
residents of Vidor are ignorant bigots, it is important to
realize that just because a person is not directly
involved in the attacks on their neighbors doesn’t
mean they contribute to a livable‘environment.

By tolerating the acts of outsiders or even fellow resi-
dents, they help to create an unhealthy environment.
They need to call others on intolerant behavior. To the
credit of Vidor, some of its citizens held a welcoming
party at noon of the same day for their new neighbors.

The armed camp which Vidor has become is the
polar opposite example of Dr. Martin Luther King’s
dream of people being judged by the content of their
character and not the color of their skin. The legal
environment has changed, but apparently the attitudes
of. the people have not. It is more important to change
the minds of the people than the laws. It is the only
way for true equality to be achieved.

According to The New

Columnist says Dr. King's dream is a reality

I was born in the spring of 1961, arguably at the
height of the civil—rights movement. My guess is it
was a time of unbridled optimism in the black com-
munity, that the justice so long denied was finally
around the comer and that racism would be just a
painful memory. From an early age, my parents
made sure I had some knowledge of black history
and the constant struggle for equality. The names
of Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T.
Washington, and of course Martin Luther King, Jr.
naturally went alongside Washington, Lincoln and
Franklin in my mind, and I considered myself to be
an heir to the promise of an integrated

civil—rights movement had less to do with rights
than it did with relationships, and it was always
inclusive. inclusiveness attracted me to the move-
ment and to Dr. King.

I have made reference in previous columns to
my education, which was predominantly private
and white, and I think it gave me an appreciation
as to what integration can do. As I related to my
white classmates, I began to notice these people
are really neat. A number of them eventually felt
the same way about me, and as a result, I was
always part of the “in crowd.” Even the racist stu-
dents came to respect me for the sim-

society. But by the time I came of age
in the early ‘70s, the mood had shift-
ed. Competition and confrontation
replaced cooperation and communica-
tion. The black community had

their level. I can’t tell you if some
minds were changed, but I like to
think I gave them some things to think
about.

become so used to being segregated
that the necessary changes were too
painful to deal with. For the first time people found
out just how far away they were from each other..
Do I think integration has failed? It hasn’t even
really been tried.

Many blacks will tell you that integration was a

disaster for the black community, with its business

community all but abandoned, its institutions deci-
mated, its culture nearly lost. But I wonder if, had
they known what would take place, they would
have supported the civil—rights movement. The

Those people who say that inte-
gration is a bad thing don't understand
why it came to pass in the first place — to bring
about healing and reconciliation. For the past 30 or
so years, American society has had a golden oppor-
tunity to break down the walls that have separated
us by color, culture and class and irrthe process
promote some sort of understanding. As one white
South African university student said, “You must
have your own culture —— and love the other one,
too.” ,

First of all, I’m opposed to
writing about differences, so this
is going to be about how differ-
ences can be compromised.

Recognizing cultural, reli-
gious, political, etc. differences
is important, as long as we don’t
harp on them. We’re different,
unique individuals. That's obvi-
ous, but the similarities are far
too often overlooked. Did you
ever look at your watch, have
someone ask you what time it is
and you have no idea? Did you
ever go into a room and have
no clue what you went in there
for? George Carlin inspired
the above paragraph, but it’s
true. These little things that hap-
pen to each of us everyday. The
underlying element is we’re all
human. So what if I’m black
and you're white? Does it matter
if I’m a Jew and you're a
Buddhist? Thinking one-dirnen-
sionally. it does. They are
important in relative terms. But
these are things that divide us,

that we fight over and kill each
other over. It’s all over these
things that, when you get right
down to it, don’t really matter.
Why did Hitler kill the Jews?
Why does apartheid exist? Why
do Songalian women suffer like

Emily
Stiger

they do? Because of the “I’m

better, I’m different from you7

phrase. Differences are impor-
tant, but they aren’t the alpha
and the omega. When taken to
extremes, differences become
our self-imposed enemy.
Instead of saying, “I’m not
like you,” why not say, “I’m like
that, too.” What are we afraid
of? Ourselves? Each other? Poor
excuses, if you ask me. I refuse
to believe hatred is innate. We
cannot be like this inside and

’Dzﬂere7/tees are not as large as t/oey appear

out, not everyone is like that.

What, then? Do we want to
change? Maybe not. It’s easier to
dismiss other people than to
accept them. It appears we are
constantly taking the easy way
out. What are computers, cable,
microwaves and those stupid
convenience stores here for?
For convenience, of course,
Maybe I’m too hard on

what “progress"" is creating — a

computer whizzes who think a

Do we want this to be our
future? One where everyone is
different, some are better, and
that is determined by the “bet-
ter” ones? Can you live with
that? See, I told you this

You can‘t help but feel sorry
for those confused CBS viewers
who tuned in a little after noon
on Saturday thinking they
would still have a couple of car-
toon—watching hours left. 7

Who can blame them for
thinking that the Pitt—Seton Hall
game wasn't just an impeccably
well-drawn version of stripe-
wearing Smurfs or the Yosemite
Sam saga (see real bad shootin‘,
varmint) or even “The A—Team"
(Pirate Arturas Karnishovas, that
is)?

But in the end, with the car-
toon fans upstairs playing Sega
and the hoops fans downstairs
with a bag of Cheetos and a
brew, the country was treated to
a Pitt basketball disappearing
act.

Tied at 34 —-— holding a little
momentum and supported by a
near—sell-out Field House crew

and a 1-3 Big East team
stood between Pitt and their
fourth conference victory of the

goes to BC

By Brett Fondrk.
Staff Writer

After a disappointing 76-67
loss on national TV to Seton
Hall, the Panthers will try to get
back on track tonight as they
travel to Massachusetts to face
Boston College at Conte Forum.

Pitt and BC are part of a
group of five teams that are tied
at 3-2 in Big East play.
Connecticut leads the confer-
ence with a perfect 5-() record.

The Panthers split the season
series with the Eagles last year
with the visiting team winning
each contest.

In the last meeting between
the two teams, BC whacked the
Panthers at Fitzgerald Field
House 79-56.

Senior center Bill Curley leads
the Eagles with an average of
20.6 points a game in Big East
play. The Eagles are coming off
a 69-49 victory over Miami in
which Curley had 25 points and
eight rebounds.

junior point guard _]erry
McCullough had one of his best
games of the season last year
against BC at Conte Forum. He
scored 22 points and dished out
eight assists to lead the Panthers
to an,81-70 victory over the

Hoops loss to Seton Hall

 

shot from the floor —— a span of
over 13 minutes without a hoop
—— and fell in a 76-67 decision to
the Pirates, the first time Seton
Hall has won in Pittsburgh since

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Senior forward _Iill Colabrese
-and junior guard _Ienine Joyce
have both racked up some big
offensive games for the Pitt
women’s basketball team (11-
3, 5-1) this season —— just not
at the same time.

Lady Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce said he hoped
Sunday’s game against 25th-
ranked Seton Hall (12—2, 5-1)
at Fitzgerald Field House
would change that.

“We were hoping this would
be the day that we could take
some pressure off of [top scor-
er] jonna [Huemrich|, and any-
body else for that matter, and
those two would be on fire
together,” . Bruce said.
“Obviously that did not hap-
pen.”

The wind chill outside
seemed toasty next to the Lady
Panther shooters, who hit on
only 32.7 percent of their
shots from the floor in a 63-52
Pirate victory.

“We shot ourselves in the
foot 21 little bit, but give credit
to Seton Hall for what they did
to us defensively," Bruce said.
“Nobody has held us under 60
points all year long.”

A major part of‘ that defense

Chris Gant did not score a point in Pitt's loss to Seton Hall
Saturday afternoon. He did manage to pick up three fouls in
a span of 21 seconds.

“The first 1() minutes of the
second half killed us,” Pitt head
coach Paul Evans said. “They
were a step ahead of us on

was pressuring Pitt point
guard Carol Morton (eight
points, seven assists), who
turned the ball over seven
times in the contest.

“They gave Carol Morton a
rough way to go out there,”
Bruce said. “It’s ironic.
Morton, over the years, has
been a thorn in their side. She
has hurt them.”

While Pitt was nowhere
near its usual offensive" aver-
age of 74.5 points per game,
Seton Hall’s total of 63 points
was actually below the aver-
age of Pitt's opponents.

“I don’t know if we played
particularly well on defense,”
Bruce said.

Although Seton Hall did turn
the ball over 20 times, Pitt was
not able to convert defense
into offense as it has all sea-
son.

“We just didn't execute well
on both ends of the floor,”
Colabrese said. “In the games
we’ve won, our defense usual-
ly helps us get into an offen-
sive set."

Seton Hall controlled the
boards on both ends of the
floor, outrebounding Pitt 45-
33, and grabbed 14 offensive
rebounds. Senior forward
Shamona Marable did much of

everything."

Including both offensive and
defensive rebounding.

"We had an exceptional sec-
ond half. especially on the
offensive boards." Seton Hall
head coach P.,I. Carlesimo said
of the 12-4 offensive rebound-
ing advantage.

“At the half we said the oppo-
site: we noticed that they were
beating us to the boards, and
we knew we had to come out
and play a tough and aggressive
game."

"We got to get Orlando
[Antigua] and Chris Gant to go
to the boards,” Evans said of the
two, who combined for three
rebounds (all Antigua).

Aside from being generous on
the glass, the Panthers were. also
very generous foul—wise, send-
ing Seton Hall to the line 49
times with the Pirates hitting on
36 of their freebies (73.5 per-
cent).

Conversely, the Panthers
were only 16 of 24 from the line
including a disappointing three-
for-seven in the first half.

“We were trying to get inside
and pump fake because they
like to block shots,” Pirate guard
Bryan Caver said. "We were get-
ting up in the air, jumping into
them and getting fouls called.”

“Some of the fouls I don’t
think were fouls," Panther cen-
ter Eric Mobley said. “I know
when I foul someone."

Pitt basketball puts on "Hockey Night in Oakland”

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

Went to a Big East basketball
game  and a hockey game
broke out.

On a blustery Saturday after-
noon better suited for polar
bears and Eskimos, scantily-clad
Panthers and Jersey boys
assembled for 40 minutes of
clutch-and-grab.

No, not two periods of puck
between the Florida Panthers

   
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  

and New Jersey’s feisty Devils
— though you’d be hard
pressed to prove it after looking
at the postgame stats. A regula-
tion game, rather, ‘tween the
Pitt and Seton Hall men’s hoops
teams, playing that graceful,
flowing sport known to all of
mankind as basketball.

Before 6,679 frigid Fitzgerald
Field House fans and a CBS
national television audience, the
two Big East combatants made
like “A Hockey Night in

Oakland,” rumblin’ and bum-
blin’ around 94 feet of hard-
wood like two National Hockey
League expansion teams.

Inept offense. Conservative
packed-in defense. And fouls?
There were more personals at
the Field House than in the
back pages of In Pittsburgh.

The only missing link to com-
plete NHL madness was a
cameo appearance by a
Zamboni (Unable to attend.

degree temperature).

How’s 50 personal fouls, 73
free—throw attempts, and just 21
assists catch you.

A bit much — but not over-
bearing — for the anything-bub
prolific but ultimately victorious
Pirates, the beneficiaries of
Saturday’s foulfest.

“The officiating was a little
too tight,” Seton Hall center
Arturur: Karnishovas said after
the game, “But they evened it
out for both sides.”

Karnishovas benefitted most
from the whistle-blowing
brigade, draining 16 of his 17
free throw attempts. As a team,
the Pirates — seriously anemic
shooters from the floor (35 per-
cent for the game) — made the
most of their foul-line opportu-
nities.

And they had their opportuni-
ties, 49 of them to be exact. The
Hall hit 36 of ‘em for a
respectable 73 percent, includ-
ing 23 of 32 during the ﬁnal 20
minutes of play. Pitt, on the
other line, had half as many
attempts, hitting 16 of 24 from
the charity stripe.

A fluke? Bad officiating?

As planned, says the Hall.

“We were trying to get inside
and pump fake because they
like to block shots," Seton Hall
point guard Bryan Caver said.
“\Y/e were getting up in the air,
jumping into them and getting
fouls called."

Fouls were called, mostly
against Pitt, which put the
Pirates in a doubly- opportunis-
tic position of draining some
free throws while pinning the
Panthers’ big men where they
were least effective: the bench.

“We were lucky to the fact
that a couple of their key play-
ers were in foul trouble early in
the game,” Seton Hall coach PJ.
Carlesimo said.

Pitt had 11 personals by half-
time —— two each for center F.ric
Mobley and Orlando Antigua,
and three on Garrick Thomas.

Men's swim and dive rebounds
from loss, drowns Cleveland St.

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team (9-1) bounced back
from a tough loss to Penn State
this weekend by winning. easily
at Cleveland St. University, 147-
91.

Pitt dominated the meet, win-
ning 10 out of the 15 events.
The Panthers finished second in
seven of the 10 events they
won.

“Cleveland St. isn’t at the
same level as us at this point,”
head coach Chuck Knoles said.
“We were fully expecting a vic-
toiy.”

“On paper they couldn’t coin-
pete with us,” sophomore Chris
Perry added. “We are a much
deeper and stronger team than
they are.”

Knoles decided to exhibition
the last two events in order to
make the score respectable.
What this means is no matter
whether Pitt won or placed in
the events, they wouldn’t get
the points. If not for this,
the score would have been 191-
70.

“The score was fairly
respectable,” Knoles said.
“Cleveland St. could walk out of
the meet feeling pretty good
about themselves.

“I don’t like, and there is no
need for, totally lopsided
scores.”

In addition, Knoles also
changed the line—up around to
give chances to some people

who usually don’t get to swim,
or to swim in other events.

“Everyone on this team is.
competitive,” Knoles said.

The Pitt divers continued their
superb performances of the
whole the season.

Rookie diver john Soulakis
started off the meet with a bang
by winning the three-meter
dive over the second place
finisher and fellow teammate
Steve Wolfe. Soulakis also fin-
ished second in the one—meter
dive.

Sean Braud’s performance on
the one-meter dive was enough
to win and qualify him for the
NCAA pre-qualification round.

“I was coming off really bad
high—board dives,” Braud said of
his qualifying dives.

“My first three (lives were
really good, and myfourth
dive I landed pretty good,
which usually makes or breaks
me.

“I made it by the skin of my
teeth, but that’s okay. I’m
happy. Now it’s just a matter of
fine tuning.”

Pitt swept three events:

In the 16SO—yard freestyle,

Sam Dommel, Gary Mule and
Joshua Haynes finished one,
two and three respectively.

In the 50-yard freestyle, Eric
Stull won, and Bob Kupperman
and Ryan Blair placed two and
three. I

Jeff Novotny took the 500-
yard freestyle with Heynes and
Stull placing behind him.

Matt Brady crushed his com-
petitors in the 400-yard individ-
ual medley by over 19 seconds.

David Williams won the 200-
yard freestyle with Jonti
Bacharach finishing second.
Then Bacharach went on to win
the 100—yard freestyle with Tony
Sunseri in second.

In the relays it was more of
the same.

Chris Balke, Perry, Brady and
Vaitiainen combined to win the
400-yard medley relay.

In the 400-yard freestyle relay,
Vartiainen, Williams, Dommel
and Bair won.

In the process of winning
the event, Vartiainen, who
swam the lead-off leg of the
relay, recorded his lifetime best
time.

Women's swim and
dive crushes Vikings

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s swim-
ming and diving team
opened the second half of
their season Saturday with a
148-77 win at Cleveland
State.

The Panthers (4-2) swam
away from the Vikings by
finishing first and second in
nearly every event. Pitt fin-
ished first in 10 of 13 races
and second in 12.

“They were small,” Pitt

head coach Marian Cassidy
said. “They had some strong
front people, but they don’t
have any depth to back them
up.”
The Panthers opened the
meet by winning the first
relay. Junior Laura Zdyb and
sophomore Susan Poor-
baugh followed that by fin-
ishing first and second
respectively in the 1650-
meter freestyle.

Senior captain Jennifer

Burns then took first in the
200—meter freestyle with Pitt
sophomore Jenny Doran fin-
ishing second and rookie
Kara Crombie taking third.

After Dana Labrie won the
50-meter freestyle for
Cleveland St., senior captain
Candie Burke led another
Pitt sweep in the 400—meter
individual medley, with
Zdyb finishing second and
rookie Charla Caponi third.

Sophomore Sunday
Lewandowski then won the
one-meter diving. She had
already won the three-meter
prior to the meet. Junior Kara
Sixbury placed second in
both of those events.

Doran and Caponi then
finished first and second in
the 100-meter butterfly, and
Pitt’s third sweep of the meet
came in the 100—meter
freestyle with Burns taking
first, sophomore Alicia
Tymes second and junior
Vicki Geubtner finishing

Women's track takes
third place in Ohio

By Keith Pompey
Staff‘ Writer

COLUMBUS, OHIO — At 6
a.m. last Saturday, the Pitt"
women’s track and field team
embarked on a three-hour cara-
van to Ohio State.

Three-and-a-half hours later,
the Lady Panthers walked off
the bus and into a freezing
French Field House, trying to
keep warm. (Due to a frigid 30
below zero wind-chill factor in
Columbus, the temperature only
went up to 4() degrees inside
French Field House.)

When it was time to compete,
Pitt proved that not even the
wind—chill factor could stop
them from heating up the track
at the annual Ohio St.
Challenge.

The Lady Panthers came
home pleased with 21 overall
third-place finish on their way
to scoring 58 points, only to be
out-dueled by Tennessee (66)
and Penn State (61).

“I’m pleased as punch,” Lady
Panther head coach Steve Lewis
said. “The track was slow. The
only things you can measure is
effort and competitiveness. We
were up at 5 la.m.l and hadto
ride the bus. Competitively we
did very well.

“I know 97 percent of our
team scored. We have a team
that can compete with anyone.”

The highlight of the»women’s
competition came in the last
event of the day.

Pitt’s 4x4()0 relay team
shocked a standing-room-only
crowd as they defeated a
mighty Tennessee squad.

As the race started, junior
Lakeya Smith handed the baton
off to rookie Angie Martin in
second place. Martin tucked
behind the Morgan St. runner

until she had 100 meters to go.

As Martin handed the baton
off to Allison Williams, the
Panthers had a three-meter lead
over Morgan St. and Tennessee.
As Williams gave the baton to
Tonya Mullins, Pitt was up by
30 meters.

As Mullins sprinted around
the’ track, all she could hear was
the chants of the crowd urging
Tennessee’s All-American, Sue
Walton, to make Mullins her lat-
est victim.

For a while it looked as if this
might happen, as Walton closed
the gap to within 10 meters.

That’s when Mullins got the
strength from within and ran
away from Walton, thus quiet-
ing the crowd.

Pitt took first place with a
time of 3:53.81, and Tennessee
finished a disappointing second
with a time of 3:57.7().

After the race, assistant coach
Keisha Dumas had this to say
about the recent upset of the
4x400 relay team:

“Every weekend, they run
beautiful,” Dumas said. “You
never expect them to do it, but
in the end they regroup and
come through. This mile relay
just proved that we can nm with
anybody.”

In other events, Pitt senior
captain Kim Blair beat her All-
American teammate Williams
with a photo finish in the finals
of the 55-meter hurdles. Blair
was timed at 7.97 seconds,
while Williams ran 7.98.

“Allison and Kim made the ,

meet,” Lewis said. They made it
easier for every one else.”
Junior Staci Suggs, also compet-
ing in the finals, took a
respectable fourth-place finish
with a time of 8.18.

When Martin, who last year
was the most sought after prep
track and field athlete in the
nation, was not helping Pitt win
in the relays, she was running
away from the rest of the field
on her way to easily winning
the 800 ( 2:15.39).

In the field events, Pitt's
Najuma Fletcher dominated by
scoring 13 points, as she placed
first in the long jump (19.5 feet)
and high jump (5 feet, 1() inch-
es).

Footbozllplozyers 5/amefor tmc/e

Byjason Feuchtwanger
and Keith Pompey
The Pitt News

COLUMBUS, OHIO — The
Pitt men’s track team traveled
to Ohio State on Saturday to

compete against the
Buckeyes, Kentucky St. and
Morgan St.

In a non-scoring meet, the
Panthers got a boost from the
football team and a strong
performance from their mile-
relay team.

In the 55-meter dash, wide
receiver Dietrich Jells sprinted
his way to a second-place fin-
ish and a place in Panthers’
record book. His time of 6.36
seconds is the seventh best
55-meter dash time in Pitt his-
toiy.

His time, a personal best,
also qualified him for IC4As.

Defensive back/wide
receiver Anthony Dorsett, a
newcomer to the track team,
followed Jells’ lead and fin-
ished fourth with a time of
6.38 seconds, the ninth-best
time in Pitt history.

Dorsett“s time, which was
his personal best as well,
qualified him for IC4As.

“Anthony Dorsett and
Dietrich _]ells had a great day.”
sprints and hurdles coach
Steve Lewis said. “I like those
guys.”

Dorsett has steadily
improved his time over the
past three meets.

“He ran 6.52 at West
Virginia, before Christmas

break, then he ran 6.44 at
George Mason last week and
now he runs 6.38,” Vasvary
said. “He just keeps learning.”

Dorsett also finished fourth
in the 200 meters with a time

of 22.37 seconds, which was a ,

personal best and qualified
him for IC4As.

“We have an excellent
group [of sprintersl,” Vasvary
said. “Football season helps.
Coach [Johnny] Majors has
always had great speed on his
football teams.”

Pitt’s 4x400 meter relay
team ran right with defending
event national champion
Ohio St., and missed winning
the race by just .55 of a sec-
ond.

Sophomore Curtis
Anderson, another football
player, led off. The Panthers
were in third place when
Anderson handed off to Jells.
Jells, who ran a personal best
on his leg, took the lead and
liancletl off the baton to first-
year runner Orrel Green with
a 10-meter lead.

Green held onto the lead,
while.Morgan St. and Ohio St.
closed in. Rookie runner
Jerrel Williams took the baton
from Green and took off on
the anchor leg. He sprinted
with Morgan St.’s runner and

Ohio St.’s runner until just-

before the finish line when,
despite running a personal
best (48.20), he was overtak-
en.

The relay team wound up
finishing in third place with a

time of three minutes, 18.79
seconds, behind winner
Morgan St. (3218.22) and run-
ner-up Ohio St. (3:18.28).

“This was the best mile
relay I've been in in my life,”
Green said. “Each time we
run we get better.”

“They [the 4x400 relay
ream] ran a great race,” Pitt
men's track coach John
Vasvary said. “That was their
best time of the year.

Another bright spot was Pitt
taking first and second places
in the 55-meter hurdles.
Sophomore Jay Murphy won
the hurdles with a time of 7.69
seconds while Wes Alexander
finished second with a time of
7.74.

In the distance events, Mike
Umbleby took second place
in the mile with a time of
4:20.08.

In the 3000 meters, Pitt
placed runners in second,
third and fourth places. Mike
Lynn crossed the finish line in
second place with a time of
8:50, Brian McCollough fin-
ished third with a time of 9:01
and Tim Arndt finish fourth
with a time of 9:27.

The football team con-
tributed strength as well as
speed to the track team. In
the field events, defensive
tackle Eric Johnson won the
shot put with a throw of 42
feet and 11-3/4 inches.

The Panthers will travel to
Virginia Tech this weekend to
face schools from the SEC and
the ACC.

Fouls

Continued from Page 10
Antigua and Thomas took
turns guarding Karnishovas,
who made the most of the
matchups with his ability to
put the ball on the floor.

“If a team tries to play inan-
to-man against us, I try to
penetrate,” Karnishovas said.
“I was fortunate to get to the
line and make my shots.”

By game’s end, three
Panthers (Antigua,

McCullough, Thomas) had

fouled out. Mobley and Chris
Gant (zero points, four
rebounds), each finishing
with four fouls, spent much of
the second half on the bench
in foul trouble.

Frus~‘.i'atecl by the officiating.

“Some of the fouls I don’t
think were fouls,” Mobley
said. “I know when I foul
someone.”

For the rejuvenated Pirates,
winners of their last two Big
East games after opening the

season 0-3, the foul-plagued
win was another muck-and-
grind effort on the road back
up the Big East standings.

“We’re starting to play
well,” forward Darrell Mims
said. “\We’re playing tough
defense right now.”

“We are not a pretty team,"
Carle.simo said, “but we
worked very hard.”

Spoken like a tenacious
muck—and-grind team — say,
the Blackhawks.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January 18,1994

the rebounding damage, grab-
bing 15 overall and four at the
offensive end.

“We let them get too many
shots,” Colabrese said. “That
slowed us down."

While the transition game was
never consistently there for the
Lady Panthers, another offen-
sive strong point was there early
on —— the three-point shot. ,

Four minutes and 24 seconds
into the contest, Pitt had three
treys, one from Joyce and two
from Colabrese. Colabrese’s sec-
ond shot from beyond the arc
put the Lady Panthers up 17-10.

The Pirates held Colabrese,
the Big East’s top three-point
gunner (.488 percentage), to
only one more attempt from
three-point range, a miss. She
scored 12 points in the first half,
and none in the second. Pitt did
not hit another three—point shot
all day.

“I was looking for it and I
wanted to [shoot], but I could
not find an opening on the
floor,” Colabrese said. “In the
first half, I was getting good
looks [at the basket], but in the
second half, I could not even
get a shot off. They shut us
down.”

Part of the problem was an
inability to set screens.

“When we tried to set picks,
they were bumping us off,”
Colabrese said. “That slowed
the whole offense down. They
got away with some holding.
Every time I was going through
the key, I was getting grabbed. I
would do the same thing if I
could get away with it. They got
away with it today.”

Bruce complained about the
officiating throughout the con-
test, but said it did not affect the
outcome of the contest.

“Have you ever been to a
game where you haven’t heard
that?” Bruce said. “There are
certain calls you hope are made.
When they arenot, you have to
say something about it.
Sometimes, you need to say
something to get their attention.

“We thought there was some
traveling going on  some
hand checking going on. We’re
not going to blame the loss on
the officiating. They are human
too.”

Pitt hung on to the lead until
the five-minute mark of the half.
Huemrich extended it to five
with a three-point play, drawing
the foul on a jump shot, with
4:54 left. Then Pirate point
guard Jodi Brooks took over.

Brooks (18 points and 11
rebounds) drained a three-point
shot, followed by a two-pointer
that tied the game. Then she
picked Panther I‘€S€l'V€ guard
Erin Maloy’s pocket and fired a

pass ahead to Marable, who
scored and drew a foul on
Huemrich. The free throw put
the Pirates up 30-27, and they
never trailed again.

“There are four of us in first
place [in the Big Eastl,” Bruce
said. “Why should we be down
about the fact that we are still in
first place? A lot of people
wouldn’t have given us that
amount of credit before the sea-
son.

“This is just one game. One
game does not allow panic to
set in. In the locker room, we
were talking about starting
another streak.”

Pitt will have the chance to do
that Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
when the 12th-ranked

Labrie won the 100—meter
backstroke, Doran and
Poorbaugh finishied one and
two in the 500-meter
freestyle. After the Vikings’
Sara Werth Won the 100-
meter breaststroke, Pitt
wound up the meet with a
first and second in the last
relay.

“I was very pleased with
the way we swam,” Cassidy
said. “We had some girls out,
but our girls stood up and
raced anyway."

“Coming off Christmas, we
were broken down, tired and
sore," Burns said. "This will
set its up for our next meets,
because we don’t have any
breaks until before the Big
East championships.”

Being broken down is

,has been out since the Pitt

something the women’s team
is getting used to. Junior
Christy Knobloch didn’t
make the trip to Cleveland
because of a herniated disk
in her back. Cassidy said she
is back in the water, and that
it will be dealt with on a day-
to—day basis.

Sophomore Jill Fletcher

Invite with a stress fracture in
her back and will not be
back this season.

Fletcher’s absence coupled
with the earlier loss of
sophomore Chantel Glover
to knee surgery leaves the
Panthers without their best
breaststrokers.

“Losing Fletcher is going to
hurt us," Burns said. “We
already miss her. We’re
going to have to work on our
strengths in other areas.”

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Tuesday, January 18, 1994

Pirates

Continued from page 9
Gant picked up three consecu-
tive calls —— his second, third
and fourth of the game and the
seventh team foul — putting the
Pirates in the bonus, and the
Panthers in a lot of trouble.

It wasn’t that Seton Hall will
be held up as a model of offen-
sive execution — they turned
the ball over 15 times and shot
35 percent (to Pitt’s 38) — but
the Pirates found ways to put
the ball in the basket, while Pitt
just simply did not.

“Pitt played man-to-man and
they didn’t switch on their
picks,” said game-high scorer
Karnishovas, who had 28
points.

Offensively, the Panthers’ out-
side game in the first 20 minutes
— five threes and 17 total points
from Pitt’s starting guards Jerry
McCullough (seven) and Ahmad
Shareef (10) / larried them to
the 34-all tie at the break.

Unfortunately, when they
tried to go inside, they found
that the paint was still dry and
they weren’t being allowed in.

“We knew [Pitt] would pound
inside because they’re a lot big-
ger than we are,” Caver said.
“They did that, but we had good
weak-side help in john Leahy
and Arturas Karnishovas and
Darrell Mims. After a while, [Pitt]
started going away from us —
we limited tl1ein...t‘o.'o,r_1el shot and

we got the‘ i‘ebg')t1ncl and execut- .

ed after.” .
Mobley liitﬂprn only four-of-

nine shots for eight total points.

“I was told to keep a body on
[Mobley], to push him out
where he’s not comfortable
shooting and he’d probably just
pass the ball,” Pirate forward
Mims said. “I tried to keep my
body on him, and I was lucky.
He didn’t take a shot at all [in
the second halﬂ.”

“They doubled down on Eric
 and he was impatient,” Evans
said. “If they would have kicked
it outside we would have been
better off.

“They’re a good defensive
team and we didn’t have the
patience.”

The game set Pitt’s chances
of immediate Big East position
back a couple of hard—earned
wins as the Panthers dropped
their second conference game
in their last three, and moved to
5-2 within the conference.

“I thought that that was a
heck of a win for anybody,
because it is a tough basketball
team,” Carlesimo said.

“Most importantly was that
we were able to come in here
and play with the type of inten-
sity that Pitt gives you [at the
Fitzgerald Field Housel."

PITT NOTES: McCullough

Pitt. Shareef (14 points) and

The Economics of the Citibank

Classic Visa card. How no annual fee, student discounts

and Price Protection create upward growt-h. A variety of factors have been suggested as
contributing to the economic growth of students, including (1) more lottery winners between the ages of
18 and 22, (2) a 37% increase on earnings from bottle and can returns, (3) more students doubling,
earnings in the lightning round of game shows, and (4) the Citibank Classic Visa® card. It’s this last one,
however, that affects most students. ‘H The Citibank Classic Visa card offers immediate savings to

student cardmembers. You can now receive the Citibank Classic card with No Annual Fee. You can

capitalize on a $20 Airfare Discount for domestic ﬂights,‘ a
low variable interest rate of 15.4%? as well as savings on mail

order purchases, sports equipment, music and magazines.

One might even have enough savings to reinvest in a CD or

store, or any store for that matter, take stock of the 3 services
concerned with purchases made on the Citibank Classic
card. Citibank Price Protection assures one of the best prices. See the same item advertised in print
for less, within 60 days, and Citibank will refund the difference up to $150.3 Buyers Security“ can cover
these investments against accidental damage, fire or theft (ordinarily causes for Great Depressions) for
90 days from the date of purchase? And Citibank Lifetime Warranty“ can extend the warranty for the
expected service life of eligible products up to 12 years? ‘[1 But perhaps the features which offer the best
protection are your eyes, your nose, your mouth, etc.—all featured on The Photocard, the credit
card with your photo on it. Carrying it can help prevent fraud or any hostile takeover of your card.
(Insiders speculate that it makes quite a good student ID, too.) Even if one’s card is stolen, or perhaps
lost, The Lost Wallet“ Service can replace your card usually within 24 hours. ‘H So never panic. As we
all know, panic, such as in the Great Parties of 1837, 1857 and 1929 can cause a downswing in a market.
But with 24-hour Customer Service, there’s no reason for it. A question about your account is only an

800 number away. (Panic of the sort experienced the night before Finals is something else

again.) ‘ll Needless to say, building a credit history with the support of such services can only be a boost. '

You’re investing in futures—that future house, that future car, etc. And knowing the Citibank Classic
Visa card is there in your wallet should presently give you a sense of security, rare in today’s—how
shall we say?—ﬁckle market. ‘H To apply, call. Students don’t need a job or a cosigner. And call
if you’d simply like your photo added to your regular Citibank Classic Visa card. Here’s the
number: 1-800-CITIBANK, extension 19.
(1-800-248-4226). 1] The Law of Student
Supply and Demand states, “If a credit card

and savings possible—thenstudents will demand
