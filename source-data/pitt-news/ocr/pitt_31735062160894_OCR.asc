O’l\/[alley Overruled
By Boyer Committee

By EDWIN ZINMAN
An interpretation of the Student Government Associa-

tion Constitution contrary to the SGA president and Judicial

Commission’s interpretation was presented to SGA this week.

' It is the ﬁrst decision of the Special Committee on SGA
Constitutional Review newly created by Dr. Peake, Assistant
Chancellor in charge of Student Affairs.

The issue was raised when SGAO

President Bert O’Malley, Col. ’59
interpreted a section providing
that “The Executive Committee
shall consist of the ﬁve elected
officers of SGA” as meaning at
least ﬁve.

Subsequently SGA voted in
April to refer the question of in-
terpretation to Dr. William
Boyer. chairman of the admini-
stration's Student Government
Committee, for his advisory
opinion.

Judicial Committee ruled last
week that O’Malley performed no
unconstitutional action.

This week the Constitutional
Review Committee, a subcommit-
tee of the University’s Student Af-
fairs Committee, ruled that only
five elected oﬂicers should consti-
tute the SGA Executive Commit-
tee.

A basis of the Review Commit-
tee’s interpretation was that the
word “shall” is a self-limiting
term, and is mandatory rather
than permissive in meaning.

Inreferring to the ﬁve elect-
ed officers the decision noted,
“The number ﬁve is a precise
speciﬁcation. This ‘is not the
minimum or maximum mem-
bership, but THE membership.”

It further stated “T0 permit
non-elected oflicers, or other per-
sons. to become members of the

SGA Approves
Collection For
Panther Statue

Student Government Asso-

ciation endorsed a motion at‘

ll/ionday’s meeting approving
solicitation of the student
body to, obtain necessary
funds for erecting a Panther

‘ statue on the Student Union lawn.

Proposed plans calls for can-
nister collections possibly at one
of next fall’s football games. If
such action were taken it would
require subsequent approval by
the stadium and administration.

Estimates for the cast bronze
Panther range above $5,000.

It was thought thatthe $3700
remaining from the treasuries of
past graduating classes might be
applied to defray the bulk of the
cost. However, future use of
these funds will give specific
recognition to the particular
class and thereby will not be
applied towards the Panther.

Objecting against the motion
Dennis Litchman, Col. ’59, claim-
ed “The type of spirit the statue
would promote would be the
“p1ayboy" type. rather than the
intellectual spirit characterized by

t

Executive Committee would com-
pletely change its nature and al-
low packing the Committee.”

The Special Committee did
mention that the president may
request the presence of other per-
sons at the Executive Meetings as
non-voters. To proceed beyond
this discretion of the President
“violates the language and spirit
of the Constitution and its clearly
expressed intent.”

Dr. Peake created the Consti-
tutional Review. Committee in
accordance with Article Two of
the SGA Constitution.

Article Two provides “the exer-
cise of the delegated authority of
the SGA is subject to the approval
of the Assistant Chance1lor-—-Stu-
dent Affairs through the Student
Affairs Committee and its appro-
priate subcommittees advisory to
him.”

Dean of Men
First Proxy

By D/IILLARD ADIDUR

Chancellor Litchﬁeld an-
nounced last night the ap-
pointment of Theodore W.
Biddle as ﬁrst president of
Johnstown College.

The new president has
served the University since his
graduation in 1929. He was ap-
pointed acting dean in 1940 and
dean of men in 1942.

He believes that “this will be
an opportunity to create some-
thing new, to build an institution
and make a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion to education in the commu-
nity.” ‘

Biddle expressed the feeling
that his service to the Univer-
sity as dean of men had been
“an exciting, hcaI't—warming ex-
perience.”

With the thousands of friends I
have made through many years of
association with Pitt student
bodies, I leave with some reluct-
ance, but this provides me with a
further opportunity to do some-
thing ior students.”

Johnstown College will have,
besides Biddle, as new president,
a dean, Dr. George Hoffman, who
is present director of Johnstown
Center.

Dr. Hoffman has been on
leave of absence serving as head
of the Bureau of Higher Educa-
tion, and is assistant secretary
of the State Council on Educa-
tion.

Biddle states that among his
aims will be the expansion of the
student body from the present 300

students to 1000 full-time Stu’-
dents. '
A four-year program in the

liberal arts will be established in
the future enabling an individual
to obtain a degree from the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh at Johns-
town.

Those who wish to enter pro-
fessional schools such as edu-
cation or business administra-
tion students will transfer to the

the university level.

Although the itinerary is not.
yet completed, Litchficld said that t
he hoped the group would visit|
among others, the universities in’
Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.

The survey will be conducted
ir accordance with the provi-
sions of an agreement reached
last January between the United

States and Russia for exchange

in cultural, technical and edu-
cational ﬁelds.

The delegation will be one of
four unive1‘sity_delegations. Other
groups will spend from two to
three weeks studying the‘ ﬁelds of
natural sciences, engineering edu-
cation and liberal arts.

Other members of the group
include President Herman VVells,

Indiana University; President
Deane W. Mallott, Cornell Uni-
versity; President '1'. Keith

Glennan, Case Institute of Tech-
nology; President }! a r r y D.

President Gaylord Harnwell,
University of Pennsylvania;
Chancellor Franklin Franklin D.
Murphy, University of Kansas
will complete the group.

The group will leave June 26

main campus under the program
of the future as is presently the
case.

The student would have the op-
tions at the end of two years of
remaining at Johnstown for a de-

Chancellor Tells Faculty
Salaries Should Go Up;

Co-operation Necessary

At a general meeting with the faculty members Monday,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld noted the upward trend in faculty

salaries.

He pointed out that the thirty-two per cent increase over
the past four years is an all-university average, and there is
a need for better balance in certain areas.

The chancellor expressed theO

hope that this raise continues!
But, he asserted, it is likely that
the increases will go to those
around whom the department
heads want to build their pro-
grams. He urged the rewarding
of the most outstanding and able
faculty members in this way.
Litchﬁeld asked for the coop-
eration of the senior members
of the faculty in helping to de-
velop their younger colleagues
in their professional ﬁelds. He
termed this an “essential in-
gredient in the development of
a total faculty.”
The chancellor also observed
that the excessive number of
part—time faculty members has
been eliminated. This has lead to
the problem of higher cost, he
added, since the university actu-
ally‘ got more than it paid for
from these ‘instructors.
He stressed, though, that creat-
ing a full-time membership is
moreimportant; Few inroads have
been made in the reduction of the
teaching load yet, but that is in
future plans.
The problem of faculty hous-
ing was also discussed. Accord-
ing ‘to Litehﬁeld, surveys are
being made for apartment living
both on and off campus. Archi-
tects are now studying possible
multiple dwelling units on
campus.
The administrative head stated
that part of the Schenley quad-
rangle will probably always- be
allotted for faculty housing. He
said that the Ruskin will also be
available as vacancies, occur, add-
ing that it is much more expen-
sive.
Concerning higher tuition, the
chancellor said that it will prob-
ably remain the same next term,
but itmight be raised for the
year 1959-1960. He said that he
was not making any prophesy,
however.
He stressed that students will
have to realize that unless they
accept greater cost, the Univers-
ity will probably ‘never achieve
the progress which has been
planned for it. They should also
understand that it is not a dis-
grace to have to borrow money
for an education.
Concerning capital planning,
Litchﬁeld reported that in the last
four years the University has ac-
quired a total of one million eight
hundred t h o u s a n (1 additional
square feet in floor space.
Some of this includes facilities
which the University had never
had such as the Schenley area.
Other additions include new
buildings like Clapp Hall.
He said that the new acquisi-
tions do not ‘represent a drain
on funds which could be used
better in more academic projects
because they are almost always
self sustaining.
A The administrator said that the
trimester program will be in the
planning stages for next year as
will be blueprints for the Health
Center. Relationships between
hospitals and clinics have been
worked out for the latter, though.

, Litchﬁeld expressed a hope for

better communications between
smaller groups of faculty mem-
bers in the departments as well as
among larger areas or between
departments.
The chancellor cited some ex-
amples of the trend towards
higher academic standards.
Book usage in the Reference
Library has increased 65 per
cent. This indicates less text-
book teaching and more refer-
ence work done by students.
Another example is that last
fall entering students from the
upper ﬁfth of their graduating
classes numbered 44 per cent of
the, freshmen while next term’s
acceptances show 55 per cent. The
chancellor said that the ﬁgure
will probably not stand, but that
a signiﬁcant drop is not expected.
Litchﬁeld ended his talk by in-
dicating the administration’s in-
terest in making the faculty a
greater force in the governing of
the University. He related that he
has not seen any group of faculty.
members more co-operative, and
that this is a hopeful sign for the
future programs.

For High Ranking Freshmen

New Philosophy Course Inaugurated

The philosophy department
will inaugurate a one year
course, Freshman Philosophy,
this falllto meet the needs of
abler students.

This course will be open

only to students who either grad-
uated in the top fifth of their high
school class or scored in the upper
half of those‘ taking the College
Entrance Board Examinations.

Borrowed from Brown Uni-
versity’s experiment in develop-
ing intellectually challenging
courses for entering freshman,
the study will be carried on as
a seminar.

A second innovation will il-
lustrate the trend toward inter-
disciplinary teaching. Dr. Fred-
erick Keﬁer, associate professor
of physics, and Dr. John Cope-
land, associate professor of Phil-
osophy, will jointly teach Phil-
osophy of the Natural Sciences,
157, during the fall term.

Extensive changes in the num-
ber system of philosophy courses

have been made. Since Freshman
Philosophy becomes 1, Introduc-
tion to Philosophy, formerly 1, be-
comes 7; Ethics, formerly 2, be-
comes 8. '

Logic and Right Reasoning,
formerly 9, becomes 3; Logic
and Scientiﬁc Method, formerly
10, becomes 4; and Approaches
to the Nature of Man, which
will be taught by Professor
VVells, formerly GE 5, GE 6, will
become GE 15, GE 16.

Two courses speciﬁcally for
graduate students will be given.
These are the Philosophy Collo-
quim, 251 and 221, which will be
the study of a major philosophical
work.

The interprofessional seminar
involving students of Law, Med-
icine, Social VVork and other
professional schools will again
be held. Speciﬁc problems in-
volving the various professions
will serve as a focus for the
seminar.

This program was established a
few years ago by John W. Mc-
Carthy, professor of‘ philosophy,
Charles W. Taintor and Henry H.

Foster of the School of Law, Paul
McLain and William Ruhe of the
School of Medicine, and Dean
Newstetter of the School of Social
Work, in cooperation with the ad-
ministration.

New to the Honors Conference
this year will be Professor Kann-
wischer, who has taught the phil-
osophy of religion courses. Philo-
sophical subjects for discussion in
the honors conference are sug-
gested by the students.

History of Philosophy 107, 108,
is available to advance under-
graduate and graduate students. It
is a basic course in the history of
ideas.

Contemporary Philosophy 61
a.nd 62 will not be given next
year but will be replaced by an
analagous course, Philosophy 95,
196, “Current Movements of
Thought.” -

Oliver L. Reiser, professor of
Philosophy, is at Oxford and Cam-
bridge in England this month
meeting personally and having
discussions with the leading ﬁg-
ures of contemporary British
philosophy.

Peake Plans
University

High School

A high school may be in-
corporated in the academic
program of the University of
Pittsburgh.

This recommendation was
made by Assistant Chancellor

Peake at a recent meeting of Re-
gional Commission on, Interrela-
tions of Secondary School, Col-

' leges and Professional Schools at

the University.

Dr. Peake said that his recom-
mendation, if acted upon, would
require the addition of a complete
high school unit to the University
organization in order to implement
properly the demonstration plan.

The acquisition of a four-year
high school facility as a new pro-
gram would provide a single con-
tinuum of education ranging from
the elementary grades through
graduate professional level.

Discussing the proposed plan,

Dr. Peake said, “On the basis \f
attitudes expressed by the Com-
mission, I am recommending to
Chancellor Litchﬁeld that the
University endeavor to make
appropriate arrangements to
make possible a demonstration
of a systematic educational pro-
gram for able students ranging
from elementary grades through
college and professional and
graduate" school.”

“Such a program under the di-
rection of a single educational in-
stitution, would make a unique
contribution to the problems of
education in America.”

He further stated that such a
plan “would do much to elimi-
nate the waste and inefficiency
of the present layer-cake system
of education.”

The Commission was formed
last fall, at the invitation of Chan-
cellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, to
study the relationships among the
secondary schools, liberal arts col-
leges, and graduate schools of this
region.

The. Commission met with Dr.
Paul Woodring, consultant for
the Fund for the Advancement
of Education and the author of
“Let’s Talk Sense ‘About Our
Schools” and “One Fourth of
the Nation.”

Dr. Woodring pointed out that
the liberal education of the aver-
age student really begins when
he learns to read and is more for-
mally concentrated in the eight

years of his schooling from the-

age of twelve to the age of twenty.

Placement of Pa war

The Special Committee on SGA Constitutional Review,
created by a misunderstanding, should be eliminated.

It has no place in a student governmental setup.

The creation of this body was not asked for by the

member of Student Government Association.
They voted to ask Dr. Boyer’s personal

opinion, as a

major author of the constitution, rather than a binding court

decision.

The Special Committee may well have been just in their
ruling. The point in question is the loss. of prestige and
power implicit in the very existence of such a star chamber.

The least this body could have done would have been
to wait until the decision of the Judicial Commission, whose
reason for existence is now nulliﬁed, had been rendered.

Nowhere in the Statement of Principles of the Special
Committee is any mention of the role of the Judicial Com-
mission of SGA made. Should not this body be consulted
’ﬁrst? ,

Or, is it to stagnate as the judicial bodies of Interim-
ternity Council and Men’s Council have done?

The only appellate court should be made up of one per-

son and used only in rare instances of misuse of power by

SGA. That person, as stated in the constitution, should be
Dr. Charles Peake who now is given ﬁnal appeal role_after

-the decision passes the Court of four faculty

We continually talk of the problems of our student gov-

ernment. It doesn’t do anything, people don’t

A new constitution was rendered to help Student Gov-

members and

ernment lift itself up by its own bootstraps. The good\done
by the constitution may have ended on May 7, date of pub-

lication of the statement of principles for the “Special Com-

mittee.”

If SGA can’t handle its own constitutional difficulties,

therefs something wrong some place.

‘This is not to say that students, faculty, and adminis-
tration should not work together. By all means, they should,

to a much greater degree than before.

However, familiarity may breed contempt in this in-

stance, if the three entities can’t, work together in a ra-
tional manner to solve student affairs difficulties.

Only one answer exists to the problem. Eliminate this
court of faculty members as an intermediary group. Let

SGA learn by its own mistakes.

The time and effort devoted to the SGA constitution is

otherwise for naught.

Banquet Fatigue

By Millard Amdur

The sheer weight of physical exhaustion is one
of the compelling problems facing prime-ministers,
presidents, and organization men.

Prime Minister Harold MacMi1lan hit upon this
great problem of the modern era
in a televised interview with
Charles Collingwood and Edward
R. Murrow.

He stated that Win s t o n
Churchill had the stamina to
hold up in office, but many, (e.g.
his person friend and predecessor
in office, Anthony Eden) ruined
the state of their health in oﬁice.»

This is a perilous condition of
our age which is the cause of a great many of the
ulcer conditions in our business leaders and so-
called successes in the nation today.

It is questionable how far the trend can go. Can
an individual sustain himself through a full-day’s
work beginning often at 8 a.m. and continue
through late banquets till midnight?

 

Or, better, can an executive even afford to

jeopardize his health and thus risk the smooth
management of his corporation or that of the
country in the case of its chief executive?

Fortune Magazine recently had a perceptive ar-
ticle on the subject of banquets for corporation
executives and the protective public-relations vice-
president whose job it is to see that no executive
is overburdened, yet no important agency is slighted
through corporation - absence.

Banquets are really big business today. Fortune
advised executives to eat light and drink not at all
in order to make three or four events in one
evening. '

Shift Technique

It told of the” almost unbelievable use of shifts;

Past, Present, Future. . .

the big boys attend the cocktail party preceding a
major banquet, and then send in the reserves for
the banquet proper while they ﬂit off to another
like program. -

The article cautioned that only the best—organized
of firms could accomplish this without ﬂaw.

This is just one ramiﬁcation of the total problem
facing, the nation.

Will this fast pace of life creeping up its steady
pace from day to day be the death of us all? It
could be the cause of many premature deaths.

We wonder too how many of these ostentatious
programs and stresses to which our executives are
subjected are really essential? Maybe it would
save a lot of time and effort it these were limited
by mutual agreement among ﬁrms. .

Even more important is the possible loss of presi-
dent or prime—minister through coronary or stroke
at a clam bake.

Sift Technique

The president could probably attend functions
every hour of day and night if heavy regulation and
sitting of the events were not done by eﬂicient
press—secretaries and administrative‘assistants.

We should not expect our chief-executives,
whether in ill-health or not at any one time, to
serve 24 hours a day, seven days each week, ﬁfty-
two weeks of the year.

They must have rest or crack under the strain and
do no good for anyone. ‘

The chancellor of the University has at times
been criticized for not attending this banquet or
that, some party or student—meeting, but he too is
faced with the difﬁculty. -

In short, the man with no ambition may well live
a more comfortable existence and even, perhaps,
increase his life span.

Of course, he won’t have the funds to live lux-.

uriously, but then, is ﬁnancial status retained in
the next world?

to travel and do research in such
inspiring places as New York
City, Miami Beach, and similar
locales.

Throw the Rocks

Passed up by certain people?

this year; The Allied Collcgiates
could have held one heck of a
rock-throwing party for Inde-
pendent-sponsored s p e a k e r s,
Harold Stassen and Roy Fur-
man. Better yet, they would
have been better off holding one
for a certain group of Indepen-
dents. .

While on’ the subject of that
group of Independents, it might
be noted that good thinking, pa-
triotic students should take ac-
tion to halt them. The group’s
everyday lunches and caucuses
are not the harmless get—to—
gethers of a fun-loving bunch
of college sophomores. They’re
actually plotting the overthrow
of the University so they can
really say that the Independents
are on top.

They’re even sending one of

‘.1 e
,1;

 

study first hand how revolutions
are started and how he can bring
back some revolutionaries upon
his return in September.

Back to next year.

By September _it should be
time for another “Committee for
the re-evaluation of the re-
evaluation of the committee that
re-evaluated the evaluation com-
mittee that was set up forsome
purpose which no one even re-
membered after they did so
much evaluating.

The University should add ‘a
river excursion steamer such as
the Avalon to its collection as
one sure‘ way to eliminate the
large number of students that
crowd the Tuck Shop and Cafe-
teria at noon.

We would have liked to have
seen a few members of the ad-
ministration take a more per-
sonal interest in being eye—wit—
nesses to the destination of a few
of the satellites. .

In considering designs for a
new key, SGA should not forget

' the key that would have a pink
border with a red background.

And why didn’t anyone vote
for Max Nue Whiffle in this past
election?

Pitt Players could probably

' turn out an excellent production
next year of “The Witch Doctor
and His Purple People-Eaters.”

We’re looking forward to the
construction of that $6500 Pan-
ther. When its completed, Jack
Hardman will dare anyone to
try and steal it. He makes one
thing clear, though. He will not
pose as the Panther out on the
lawn as he finds occasion to do
on the eighth floor.

And then there are a few
quickies which we can see hap-
pening next year. Pitt will an-
nounce construction of a new set
of buildings in honor of the
City’s Bicentennial. The Uni-
versity will also purchase Forbes
Field for the beneﬁt of Carnegie
Tech’s football team. In the off-
season it will be turned into a
parking lot.

The typewriter‘ seems to be
running out of ribbon and the
night seems to be running out of
time so there is room for only
one more thing we would like
to see happen next year. (If
nothing until now has been
taken with tongue in cheek,
please take this with double
tongue in an extra large cheek.)
The Pitt News will not make
any mistakes next year.
Wanna Bet!

And with this Nehru, who can
now pronounce Jawarharlal,
closes the book for another sum-
mer and heads back t.o the climes
of India.

Letters

Editor, Pitt News:

I believe some clariﬁcation is
necessary about the recent letters
to the Pitt News concerning the
Newman Club.

I would like to say that the
Newman Club is the “Catholic
religious organization” on this
campus. It has never sponsored a
solely social calendar but includes
a balanced program of religious,
educational, social and athletic
events. We would hope that it is
not generally believed by Cath-
olics on Pitt’s campus that the
club is run-by a “small clique” of
leaders and certainly the Execu-

tive Board has not made the state-'

ment concerning YM—YWCA

membership. The Catholic Church I

teaches that participation in re-
ligious ceremonies or services
other than Catholic ceremonies
are forbidden and since the YM-
YWCA are religious groups a
Catholic may not in good faith be
both a Catholic and a YM—YWCA
member. This does not imply that
a Catholic may not participate‘ in
the social or athletic events spon-
sored by the “Y” or freely dis-
cuss mutual problems with them.
The Newman Club stands ready
to answer any and all questions
which the students and,faculty
would like to ask and invites all
Catholics to participate in its bal-
anced-program of events for the
coming year. '

Sigs Present Opposition  

Phi Eps Seek All-S¢porf§___Prize<

In Softball Competition

By LARRY HAGGERTY

The outcome of the softball tournament will determine
the winner of the 1957-58 IF All-Sports Trophy. Leading the
fraternities so.far is Phi Epsilon Pi. The only other team that
is in contention for the title is Sigma Chi. ,

As of today it is still not known whether the Phi Eps have

a three or four point margin over the Sigs,-‘The confusion in M

the point total is due to the re-6
sults of the golf tournament which
was completed at Wildwood last
week.

Sigma Chi was the apparent
winner of the golf meet when
the results were ﬁrst announced,
but Phi Gamma Delta posted a
later score wlich was several
strokes better than that of the
Sigs, -so now a dispute has arisen
as to who the actual winner ac-
tually is. \

Golf Tourney Dispute

If Sigma Chi is awarded ﬁrst
place in the golf tournament, and ‘
is able to ﬁnish on top in the
softball meet, they'wi1l overtake
Phi Epsilon Pi and become the re-
cipients ofpthe first annual IF All-
Sports Trophy. —

However, if the Sigs ﬁnish
second to Phi Gamma Delta in
the golf tourney and then go
on to capture the softball title,
they will ﬁnish in a. tie with
Phi Epsilon Pi providing that
the Phi Eps ﬁnish second in the
ﬁnal competition.

The tennis tournament was cap-
tured by Phi Epsilon Pi. Their
closest rival was Sigma Chi. Dud-
dy Fishman and Ed Friedlander
handled the singles’ assignment
for the Phi Eps while Norm Abel-
son and Ed Bolner took part in
the doubles.

Reinhold Scores Double

Sigma Chi registered 46 points
in capturing the IF track title.
The Sigs were followed by Omega
Psi Phi, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Delta
Tau Delta with 39, 36‘/‘;, and 26
points respectively in the battle

Court Decision
Reverses SGA

On Executives

(Continued from Page 1)
to any question of interpretation
of the SGA Constitution raised by
any party of interest.

Appeals from the decisions of
this Committee may ﬁrst be
taken to the Student Affairs
Committee and then to the As-
sistant Chancellor-Student Af-
fairs. ~

O’Malley referred to the crea-
tion of the Constitutional Review
‘Committee as an “apparent mis-
Iinterpretation of SGA’s original
' intent. We intended an opinion not
gan administrative interpretation.”

Judicial Committee Chairman,
jWoody Turner, Col. ’61, claimed
,9 "There is no more of constitutional
jbasis for an administrative inter-
pretation than there is for a stu-
dent group’s decision.”

Dr. Boyer commentedon the
Special Committee, “I have cre-
ated a continuous independent
body who can maintain syste-
matic overview of the entire
constitution for correct inter-
pretation.”

In a further statement Dr.
Peake noted, “During the first
years of the implementing of a
new ‘constitution problems of in-
terpretation are bound to arise.”

He added, “Otherwise old habits
and old practices are likely to con-
tinue and undermine all the inten-
tions of those who so carefully
prepared the constitution."

“If we are to have a student
government possessing stability,
the constitution must serve as the
basic guiderather than the predi-
lection of changing student offi-

cials." .. . . .

Bermuda Shorts Ruled

such schools as Swathmore and
Reed.”

In a further statement Litch-
man noted, “We should examine
seriously the degree of any bene-
ﬁt in relation to a price tag of
$5,000.”

Speaking for the motion he
7-.ade, Jim Finnegan, Col. ’60,
emphasized, “Not only will we
provide a lasting tribute to the
University of Pittsburgh mas-
cot, but will stimulate an up-
surge in student spirit.”

SGA approved a ruling regard-
ing Shorts recommended by an
earlier meeting of the Executive
Committee with Brackenridgc and
Schenley Houses.

Bermuda shorts may now be
worn ‘in all areas on campus ex-
cept classrooms and formal din-
ing areas. »,

Vice President John Strauch re-
ported that members of the ex-
ecutives of student government of
Mt. Mercy, Chatham, Carnegie
Tech, Duquesne, and Pitt will
meet at a dinner meeting May 29
to formulate a district colleges’
organization.

Treasurer Kent Jarrell, Col.
60, presented the proposed
standing committees’ budget for
next year which totals $7,590.
Cultural Committee Chairman,

Lois Capin, Col. ’6l, announced
her committee’s new innovations
for next year.

Chief program will be Pitt‘s
contribution to the Bi-Centennial
Celebration. Other programming
additions include book reviews,
exhibitions, lecture, and discus-
sions. . _ .. -

Fred Whittier, Col. ’61, re-
ported the unlikely establish-
ment of_a student operated ra-
dio station next year. Since the
University’s budget was already
decided in January there exists
no apparent source of revenue
for the $6,500 required.

Resignation of Richard Mattern,
Col. ’59, as member of Student
G 0 v e r n m e n t Association and
Chairman of Committee on Re-
cognition of Student Organizalions
was announced.

_ This culminated the meeting of
SGA for the year.

Offices HRelocate(l;
Chaplain Luccock
Moved to Union

A change has been instituted on
the first floor of the Cathedral.

The Information Office, former-
ally to the left of the Fifth Ave.
entrance, has been moved to_ the
Chaplains Office. The Chaplains
office is now Tocated at 407-409
Student Union.

The Student Hostess office
will be -located to the rear of the
new Information Room.

The purpose of the move was to
place executive offices of the new
Vice Chancellor of Health Profes-
sions, Dr. E. R. McClusky, for-
merally of Childrens Hospital on
the ﬁrst floor of the Cathedral
with other executive offices. The
only available space was the In-
formation Room.

Complete renovation of these
offices should be complete by the
beginning of J uly-

/2

for the number one position.
The only double winner of
the meet was Sigma Chi's vers-
atile Chuck Reinhold. Reinhold
won the 120 yard low hurdles
with a time of 15.5 and then
came back to win the high
jump with a leap of 5’7”.
Other Sigma ‘,hi winners were
Turner Williamson and Fritz
Walker, Williamson captured the
mile by recording a time of 5.21.
A heave of 40’8" earned Walker
a ﬁrst place in the shotput event.
Phi Eps Win Relay
Tom Jones of the Omegas won
the 220 yard dash in 24.1 seconds.
The broad jump went to Sam

Griffie of Omega Psi Phi with a . .
mark. The Omega’s 880' ,,

19’4”
yard relay team also garnered a
ﬁrst by registering a time of 1243.
Phi Epsilon Pi’s Herb Blitz-
stein won the 100 yard dash in
10.7 seconds. Blitzstein then
combined with Fishman, Marty
Feldman, and Aaron Lupovitch
to win the 440 yard relayyin the
fast time of 48 seconds ﬂat.

The softball tournament is in
progress now and should be con-
cluded within two or three days.
The consensus of opinion among
the fraternities is that Sigma Chi
and Phi Epsilon Pi should meet
each other in the tournament
ﬁnals.

The winner of this game would

then become the IF All-Sport

champions. The Sigs downed the
Phi Eps 3-1 in.one of the tourney's
earlier games.
