SENIOR “HOP” SCHEDULED.

 

Other Plans for Senior Week are
Fast Taking Shape.—Alumni
Banquet on Friday.

 

 With the acceptance by the Hon.
George Wilkins Guthrie of the invita-
tion to deliver the address at the
annual University commencement ex-
ercises on Wednesday, June 16, plans
were practically completed for this
year’s closing events. Mr. Guthrie,
who isone of Pitt’s most famous sons,

graduating with the class of 1866, is ’

at present the United States ambas-
sador to Japan and is now in this
country on a short leave of absence.
Before his appointment as diplomat
to. Japan, he served for gthree years
as mayor of the city 0 Pittsburgh.
Mr. Guthrie will also be the speaker
at the annual aliumni banquet _at the
Hotel Schenley that same evening.

This years’ commencement program,
of twenty-four
events to be crowded in the sevent
days of senior week, is the most com-
plete and pretentious yet attempted
by a graduating class of the Univer-
sity. The senior examinations will
be held on Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday of next week, and so _the great-
er part of the program is thrown
upon the three days of the week fol-
lowing. _

The ﬁnal week, however, will be
officially opened at three o'clock
Thursday afternoon, when the mem-
bers of the 1915 class will gather on

the University campus to plant a tree.

in memory of the ones "who this year
depart from Alma Mater. Friday
morning at 10:30 the regular class
day exercises will be held in Memorial
hall, the program being furnished by
the seniors, all of whom have not as
yet been selected. Promptly at noon
the General Alumni association will
hold their annual meeting and lun-
cheon at the Fort Pitt hotel. In the
evening, Trees’ gymnasium will be
the scene for the ﬁrst “senior hop”
given as part of the ﬁnal week.

On Saturday, the main feature of
interest to one. and all will be the
annual base ball game between Pitt
and W. & J. at Trees stadium: This
is the ﬁrst of a two game series, the
second being played at Washington
on Tuesday, June 15. In the evening,
at eight o’clock, the senior theses -of
the school of engineering will be read
in Thaw hall.

Chancellor Samuel "Black McCor-
mick will deliver the baccalaureate
sermon to the students at 11 o’clock
Sunday morning in the First Baptist
Church, Belleﬁeld and Bayard sts.

"Monday will be’ devoted to the
clinics of the School of Medicine at
the Mercy and Children’s, hospitals
and the Tuberculosis League, and to-
the exhibits of the departments of
ﬁne and industrial arts and of house-
hold science and art. These exhibits
will also be held on Tuesday. Dean
and Mrs. G. Chambers will hold a re-
ception for the graduates, faculty, and
senior class of the School of Educa-
tion at the Fifth avenue building of
that school. The faculty will also
meet the seniors in a base ball game

Good fellowship, good “eats,”

Chemical society of the University,
held at the Ge_rman club last Thurs-
day evening at six thirty p. m. The
affair was attend by thirty of
the students, faculty and prominent
alumni.

G. M; P. Baird of the English de-
partment was toast master of the
evening and special tribute was paid
to Dr. Francis Clifford Phillips, the
retiring head of the chemistry de-
partment. -

The good time began when Mr.
Brenner, president of the society in-
troduced Mr. Baird as the toastmaster
of the evening. Those present could
not speak too highly of Mr. Baird’s
ability as a master of ceremonies and
reported that there was not a dull
moment during the program.

During the evening Director Silver-

man, Dr. Marks Neidle, A. A. Clegg
and L. E. Roberts of the chemistry
department spoke on various subjects.
Messrs. Hodgson, Long and R. W.
Davis, students of the department re-
viewed the past year’s work and gave
some of the society’s plans for the
next year. At the close of the talks
Dr. Phillips was called upon for a
few remarks and as he rose a great
ovation was given him. Music was
furnished by W. C. Ford, Econ. ’16,
who presided at the piano. ,
A number of stunts were carried
out that, were not on the program or
menu. Of these the one that made
the biggest hit was a novel tobacco
pipe that could be smoked by two per-
sons at the same time. It was made
of supplies used in the chemistry lab-‘
oratory. The menus were printed on
circular pieces of ﬁlter paper and were
tied at the topwith pieces of litmus
paper and decorated with shapes of
test tubes, beakers and other chem-
istry utensils.

At the close of. the eating and
merrymaking a short business session
was held at which the following
officers were elected for the year
1915-16: president,'R. W. Davis; vice
president, R. L. Wharton; secretary-

treasurer, J.‘ N. Crombie.

All arrangements have been com-
Eeted for the testimonial dinner to
e tendered to Dr. Francis Clifford
Phillips and Mrs. Phillips, at the Ger-
man club in Craft ave. tomorrow even-
ing. The guests will number in the
neighborhood of 100 and _will sit down
at six-thirty o'clock sharp. The din-

, ner is being given by the former stud-

ents and friends of Dr. Phillips, who
desire to show to him this ﬁnal mark
of love and esteem, upon the occasion
of his retirement from active service
in the department of chemistry, and
his becoming emeritus professor of
that subject.

Doctor Phillips began his service
with the old Western University in
1875, and has therefore taught at W.
U. P. and Pitt for forty years, being
the oldest professor in the University
in point of service. He has just turn-
ed his sixty—ﬁfth year, and is retir-
ing under the terms of the Carnegie
foundation, with a teacher’s‘ pension,
to devote the remainder of his life to
literary and scientiﬁc endeavors.

The dinner will be informal, ladies

Issues Next Year.

The Panther will appear next Mon-
day for the last ti.nie this year in
larger size and brighter appearance.
This makes the fourth number for the
ﬁrst year of the Panther’s existence.

The board promises that the last

that is asked at this time is that the
students signify their intention to sup-
port the journal next year. Collec-
tions will be made when school starts

Three members of the Grand Army
of the Republic were speakers at as-
sembly last Friday at Soldier’s Me-
morial hall. The chairman was Col.
J. M. Schoonmaker and he called upon
Alexander Dempster, former presi-
den -of the board of trustees of the
University and Co. G. W. Allyn.

Col. Schoonmaker spoke of the
early days of the war and gave a
number of interesting reminiscences
of the time when he, at the age of 18,
left the old Western University of
Pennsylvania and enlisted in the army
of the Union. He also referred to

the site of the Memorial hall and the
Schenley hotel. Col. Shoonmaker said
in part: ,

“When the Civil War broke out the
whole country was in a state of un-
preparedness, and much distress was
caused that could have been avoided.
In this age we must not allow our-
selves to become defenseless; we must
be able to defend ourselves and our
country in case we are called upon to
do, so. But before we plunge our-
selves into war we should look at the
awful tolls of it as shown to us by our

Queen to Choose Attendants
- Soon-—Pageant Will Close the
Days’ Festivities.

At a spirited and closely contested
election which was not decided until
the last ballots were counted, Ruth
Harvey, Col. ’15, was last. Wednes-
day elected May Queen of the Univer-
sity over the two other candidates,
Helen Fisher and Olive Neudorfer.
This election marked the ﬁnal stage
of the long struggle which began with
the attempt of the coeds to select their
favorite senior. to preside over the
play day exercises of June 15. Miss
Harvey is a, member of Pi Theta Nu
sorority. She is a resident of Oak-

‘ land, the late Dr. J. W. Harvey, for

a number of years ﬁnancial secretary

‘of the University, being her father.

The results of the election were: Miss
Harvey 75, Miss Fisher 69, and Miss
Neudorfer 62.

This success entitles Miss Harvey
to lead the procession of all the girls
of the University, which will formally
open the ﬁrst play day exercises given
under the auspices of the Women's
Activities association. The march will
be closed with. o,the ceremony of

also the announcement of the board
for the next year which will be headed
by Harry E. Dougherty as president;
Edwin B.’ George as editor-in-chief;

 

ager—in-chief.

Both the editor-in-chief and man-
ager-in-chief have had experience and
preparation for the work of the com-
ing year. George is assistant manag-
ing editor of THE PITT WEEKLY,
was captain of the Freshman debating
team, a member of the varsity deb-
ate, assistant manager of debat-
ing, and was a member of the student
zcnate duringthe past year. Arther
is assistant sporting editor of THE _
PITT WEEKLY, also a -member of
the debating team, and was likewise
a member of the student senate.
George is a student in the College

department while Arther represents '

the School of Economics. Daugher-
ty also hails from the Department of
Economics. ‘

The 1917 board is the ﬁrst one since
the initial appearance of the Junior
Owl in 1907 to effect their annual’

organization and election of officers .

before the conclusion of the spring

term. The advantages of this change

in date, which will probably be made

permanent from now on are self-evi- '
dent, as it enables the newly-elected

officers to take hold of the work of

publication and managing of the book

throughout the summer term.

The editor will probably « appoint
the students to ﬁll the position of mis-
cellaneous, activities, fraternities, art,
and sporting editors before the end of
the term. William T. Canan has al-
ready been appointed controller by
the manager. - \ ‘

The board has extended an invita-
tion to any student so desiring to at-

tend the meeting of the board today Al

may deem likely to improve themqual- .

LAY EDITORS.

 

“The Oberlin Review”. of recent
date had an editorial referring to a
" contemporary which headed its column
corresponding to our “Letter Box”
with the words “Student Editorials.”
The “Review,” whose own open
column is called “The Forum,” goes
on to comment upon the aptness of the
title mentioned, as expressing the
goal to be attdined for such a depart-
ment. THEVWEEKLY desires to add
its little impetus to the idea, and send
it on its way rejoicing. Across the

top of our front page, we print the,

words, “The Official Student and
Alumni Journal of the University of
Pittsburgh.” If that caption is ever

plete signiﬁcance, it can only doit by
the co-operation of the whole student
and alumni body, not only in the mat-
ter of suporting the, paper monetarily
speaking, but also in making it their

well as theory. It is at all times the
wish of the editorial department that
the editorial column may Express as

wishes and ideas of the majority of

contributions of every student. Try
it once. 'If you think free speech has

We are sorry, inthe ﬁrst place that
the‘ authors of the above plaints have
not had the exquisite pleasure of edit-
ing a college annual. It might prove
an eyeopener for some. The ease with
which one man can ﬁnd nice things to
say about twenty or thirty or 100 or
400 individuals which will work no
detriment to the feelings of any, and
at the same time make the publication
capable of affording live and palatable
reading for the satiated and caviar-
jaded appetite of the poor stude who
buys it,» would astound him. If peo-
ple would only recognize that a book
like the Owl has got to be composed
of something more than insipid and
colorless sugar-and-water literature,
more alowances would be made for
the sins of the eidtors. We could tell
the truth, the plain truth, and nothing
but the truth, but it would make about
as interesting reading as can be found
within the pages of the Congressional
Record or the Pitt Panther.

years is a long time to spend in any

of it to forty successive generations
of college students, who shall them-

knowledge to.the uttermost" limitsof
science and of life, it is doubly honor-
able, and becomes ample warrant for
all the expenditure of time or of en-

SLUMP. A

 

Take about a dozen of the best indi-
vidual stars in college baseball, add a
few ounces of “I-don’t-care,” and a
sprinkle of absent team-play; put
through a short schedule meat-grind-
er, dampen with much heavenly weep-
ing on the part of old J upe Pluve; S33"
son with a slight pinch of cheer-lead-
ing (Pitt brand); and "roast in the oven
of student knocking——here is the best
recipe we can think of for a genuine
old-fashioned Piratical slump in Old
Uni’s baseball fortunes.

What in thunder’s the matter with
the old team? Don’t we all know
that they couldn’t be beat if they once
got going right? Two or three of the
above ingredients are quite beyond
our poor power to add or to detract.
There still remains the fact that the
stars are failing to twinkle, when they
should be simulating the Aurora Bore-
alis in the Spring ﬁrmament of col-
lege sport. The coach of the West Vir-
ginia team, before last week’s games.
said: “The Pit't team, I believe, is the
-best college team in this part.of the
country, although they have not_Yet
reached their stride in team play.
Individually, they are much better
than any college team I have seen ‘In
action this year.” We have no means
of knowing what his opinions Were
after Friday’s and SaturdaY’S 595'
sions. It’s vup to the Players to aim‘
inate just a little of that tendency to
sulkiness and “play-my-W3Y'01"We“
won’t play—at-all.” If there was not
quite so much watching of batting
averages and the grand-stand, and
just a little more co-operation in the
ﬁeld and on the base-paths, more
games would be coming into the right
side of the ledger.

But now when the team is losing,
is the best time of all to show what
sort of a student body there is back
of them.‘ Let’s more of us attend the
last two chances at home——-W. & Jon
June 12 and the Alumni on Commence-
ment day, and make the boys feel that
if they play the best game they know
how, we're with them, whether they
lose a whole season’s games.

 

“WOOLLY HOSS.”

 

To those who have studied the
science of atoms and molecules in the
Western University of Pennsylvania
or the University of Pittsburgh during
the last quarter-century, that title
needs no explanation nor elevation. It
is one given not in derision or diminu-
tion, but in love and homage. “Woolly
Hoss” is more than a scholar. He is
more than a teacher.’ He is more
than a man of letters. He is ‘a tang-
ible human factor in the lives of num-
berless of his “old boys.” “Friend”
is an easily abused word, and few of
us have the right to use it lightly.
But here is a man upon whom the
name of. friend sits with dignity, ap-
propriateness and grace. A teacher
who makes geniality his stock in trade,
and kindness one of his every-day
assets, is rare enough to be appreciat-
ed deeply by the students whojfa-re

 set about with malice pre-
0  and personal grudge into the

   

capable of appreciating their instruct-

jump to the conclusion that it was be- p

‘better theater.

long life and happiness of the good
doctor, and his gracious helpmeet.

LETTER BOX

The Owl Board,

University of Pittsburgh.
Gentlemen:

I have read the beautiful dedicatory
statement of the Owl, and the ﬁrst
pages, and have turned over the re-
maining pages of the volume. I wish
to congratulate you (upon the 1916
edition, and to express the pleasure it
has given me to look it over. It seems
to me that it is quite in advance of
any previous publication, and that it
accomplishes in the fullest measure
the object of such a work.

I can imagine the amount of toil in-

volved in issuing a book of nearly ﬁve
hundred pages, with .all of the photo-
graphs, drawings, etc.; yet in spite
of the amount of work involved, it is
a thing distinctly worth while, and
will bring back to the editors far
more than they put into it. I do not
refer to dollars, but to experience and
discipline. »
All in all, it is a most worthy pub-
lication, and one which will be not
only honor to the class, but of real
service to those who are interested in
the University and who wish to keep
a record of events.

With sincere congratulations, I am
Very tnuly yours,
S. B.‘ McCORMICK.

DRAMA LEAGUE HOLDS
ANNUAL CONVENTION.

» \

(Ed. Note:-—-The following is an ac-
count of the National Convention of
the Drama League, held in Detroit,‘
April 21-24, 1915. _Prof. Lincoln R.
Gibbs, head of our department of Eng-
lish, and president of the Pittsburgh
center of the Drama League,» was a
delegate, and submits this report.)

The convention was of the nature
of a conference upon ways and means
of promoting practically the objects
of the league. These objects may be
deﬁned very simply as organizing the
people of this country who, for one
reason or another, want a better class
of plays than the _commercial theaters
now afford. Some supporters of the
movement are reformers, some wish
to develop dramatic art, some believe
in the necessity of better and clean-
er recreation-—there is a great variety
of interests and tastes in the move-
ment; but all unite in the conviction

be improved by’ the right sort of
audiences. The organization is... not
foolish enough to suppose that bad
plays can be directly and immediate-
ly annulled through its inﬂuence; but
it does hope to organize and bring to
bear the support for good plays that
now‘ exists, and to educate a large
public for them. It aims to group to-
gether all forces that make for. a
Some of its speciﬁc
methods are as follows:

First (and most important): Giv-
ing- information, through bulletins,
‘concerning worthy plays, and so en-
couraging authors and producers by
rallying an audience.

Second: Working for the establish-
ment of non-commercial theaterst,
“little theaters," -“community theat-
ers,” ultimately , (in every considera-
able city) ya municipal theater.

Third: Educating’ the adult public
in dramatic taste,75'be- organizing stiidy
groups, holding lectures, inﬂuencing
libraries to ‘add to collectionsof

dramatic niaterial‘,-§aniiF'd;he other usual

Separate colleges for women in the
United States should be abolished and
coeducation substituted, according to
Prof. Roswell Johnson and Bertha J.
Stutzmann, of the University of Pitts-
burgh. This conclusion is based on the
charge that women’s colleges contrib-
ute largely to race ‘suicide amongllthe
best elements of the American popu-
lation.

In support of this contention the
records of Wellesley College have
been analyzed and the results pub-
lished in the June number of the
Journal of Heredity, organ of the
American Genetic association of this
city. The writers ﬁnd that twenty
years after graduation less than one-
half of the girls have married. These
have borne only one and one-half
children each. Taking all the stud-
ents into account and allowing enough
time to elapse so that it is ‘probable
they will -bear no more children, it is
found that the Wellesley girls'con-
tribute less than one child each to the
race—that is, they do not even repro-
duced their own number. And the
honor scholars, who from a eugenic
point of view, are assumed to be the
pick of the lot, do only about a third
as well as this.

In ‘order to maintain a stationary
population, the writers say that every
married woman should bear four chil-
dren. From this point of view they
believe the women’s colleges are hast-
ening the extenction of the old Ameri-
can stock.

The colleges are blamed for failure
to give girls an opportunity to meet
young men and for failure to make
them desirous of competent to be
wives and mothers. It is shown sta-
tistically that the marriage rate of
coeds is considerably better and it ‘is
remarked that at Wellesley the stud-
ents are forbidden to receive men call-
ers even on Sunday, their only free
day. . Viewed as to marriagability,
the writers consider a woman most
attractive during her college years,
and they declare it of vital importance
that young men should be allowed to
meet her in that period.

lWomen’s ‘colleges are a historic
blunder, it is stated.

“The separation of sexes in differ-
ent colleges and the failure to teach
girls domestic science are contrary to

the interests of society and the race,”

and “parents are urged to send their
daughters to co-educational universi-
ties, or at least to semi-co-educational
ones, such as Harvard and Columbia,
where they will have some opportuni-
ty to meet superior young men,” pend-
ing the time when women’s colleges
will be reorganized on lines more like-
ly to safeguard the future of the race,
the writers say.

porary stage, and so fostering a
thoughtful reading of such material,
as a supplement to the theatrical im-
pression. A

The convention was devoted to the
furtherance of this program in two
general ways: (1) education of the
delegates themselves to an apprecia-
tion of the educational, sociological,
artistic and moral implications of the
program; and (2) somewhat technical
discussion of ways and means. It
was addressed by the heads of its
national committees and by special-
ists in various phases of the theater
and of dramatic art, such as sClayton

Stevens (Carnegie Institute), and
many others. i 2

A third prominent interest _was the
planning of a suitable celebration of
the ter-centenary of 'Shakespeare’s
death/(April 23, 1916). It is proposed
to give a national scale to this cele-
bration, and to enlist the theatrical
profession,
bodies. _ «

It is perhaps wise ‘to add that this
convention (the ﬁfth) was by far the
‘best attended in the history of the or-
ganization, was most enthusiastic and
successful; and that a very lively com-
"petition developed among many large

Fifty Years Hence.

 

One day in June, ﬁnding that I had
some time to spare in Pittsburgh, I
decided to employ it in a visit to the
University, where I had not been for a
number of years, not in fact since our
class reunion thirty years before. As
I walked up the boulevard, towards
the hillside now ‘thickly studded with
buildings, I noticed that the students
were all going in one direction, to-
wards a building_ set right upon the

in that direction and, upon drawing
near, was enabled to read across its
front “Stduent Building.” I then re-
membered that this was the new, but
long expected building, which had been
dedicated but a few years before; and
the sight of it called to mind how we,
at the time of the great campaign
had helped to select a site for the
ediﬁce which We fondly expected at
any moment. But that had been ﬁfty
years before,’ and now our grandsons
were priding themselves upon its ac-
quisition. .

As I had climbed the hill with slow
steps, for I was no longer as young as
when I had scaled the cliffs to the
“gym,” I had paused every now and
then to note the many changes upon»
the “campus,” and to recall the days
of old. Where bare places and
clumps of brush had once stood in dis-
orderly array buildings now rose in
majestic splendor with shady paths
winding around the neat terraces.
Everything was arranged in response
to a deﬁnite plan, corresponding each
to the other in the architectural de-
sign. The bath houses. next to the
Mellon Institute had been long since
removed and even the “bughouse”
home of the biology department had.
been replaced by a beautiful stone"
building upon the same site. The ad-
ministration building was now placed
between the old halls of Thaw and
State, while just beyond stood the
building devoted to the college. Then
arranged in order as one ascended the
hill were the homes of the various
departments as well as a separate
-building for the library. Crowning
the top of the hill was a whole group
devoted to the School of Education.

When I recovered from my revery
in the ﬁelds of ancient history, to
which the old familiar sights had led
me, I saw that the students had all
entered the building, so I too followed
their footsteps, wondering if chapel
were still a place of such calm repose
as in the days of old. But as I en-
tered the great auditorium, I saw be-
fore me a platform ﬁlled with-a great
array of dignitaries and grouped be-
hind them hundreds of students. Then
and only then did I realize that I had
happened unwittingly upon another
commencement day after so long an
absence. After listening to an cra-
tion delivered by as man whose name
seemed to ﬁt somewhere into the past,
I saw diplomas enough given out to
supply almost the whole student body
of my generation."

On leaving the hall, I met just out»-
side the door the ﬁrst old friend since
.I had come home to Pitt, for there
stood a boy with the successor to the
Weekly, now grown to a daily of
quite modest proportions. Securing a
copy, I wandered to the library, and
upon entering was quite amused to be-
hold a sign “No cats or talking al-
lowed here.” Seating myself at one
of the tables, I ran rapidly over the
columns of my paper discovering
therein a real news item, to me at

with W. & J. would be played that
same afternoon.
After going to “see Wolfe at the

campus and gave myself up to a com-
parison of conditions between now
and then. Although the appearance
of the landscape had undergone a com-
plete metamorphosis, yet the life here
was much the same as in the -bygone
years. The co-eds, now grown to a
respectable numberfyet loitered on
the campus and around the buildings,
laughing and ﬂirting, distracting the
attention of all who came within sight
or sound of them, and bringing to one
and all the advantages and disadvant-
ages of coeducation. ‘If you knew
them, you were heartily in favor; if
not, you loudly expressed the wish
that they would send all the girls to
Indiana Normal.

Alittle later, I turned-my steps to-
ward the top of the hill once more,
and going with the crowd, I soon found
myself seated in the grandstand of
the athletic ﬁeld. Suddenly I sat up
straight and wiped my glasses, for
something strange was coming along
the stands. After a careful ‘scrutiny,
I seized the arm of my nearest neigh-
bor and speaking excitedly but in a
voice carefully modulated so as not to
frighten the most timid of Dean Fet-
terman’s phenomena, f asked: “How
did it live through the winter?” “What
are you talking about, our cheer

But as he clearly felt sorry that the
University had not yet added a Ide-
partrnent of lunacy to which I might
have been conveyed, I did not press-
the matter but ‘ gave myself up to a
consideration of the cheerleaders I
had known. In my freshman year,
there was one who never hurried or
never worried but got fair cheering
in the football games; then there was
a little fellow, who wanted to talk so
fast that he began his sentence with"
the "period and ended in capitals, who
both hurried and worried and. got
some cheering; then came the man
who saw cheerleading degenerate to a
minus quantity and who thengave it
up as a bad job; last but not least

secured the job he coveted, and who
then set about collecting Fatima tags
for 2. motorcycle and so ended another
cheerleader. - -‘
But I was awakened from my
dreams by some cheering such as I
never dreamed would ever exist at
Pitt. This genius in charge actually
forgot to watch the game in order to
lead the cheers. Then after the game
started, I was permitted to view an-

ar to’"“"’t'hat of the City and County
clubs of other universities and puts
our three organizations on a sound
working basis. ' . ‘

The annual meeting of the Jeffer-
son county club will be held the ﬁrst

Monday in January,’ Beaver county ‘

the ﬁrst Monday in February, and
Westmoreland county the ﬁrst Mon-

“day in March. Each year an effort

will be made to boost the-membership
of the Clubs and strengthen their or-
ganization generally. All three are
sure to become very powerful agen-
cies for advancing the causes of Alma
Mater. The clubs all have “live wire”.
Secretaries in Messrs Jenkins, Jordan
and Thompson and as much: of the de-
tail work devolves on them, the alum-A
ni Secretary is conﬁdent that they
will always have the clubs very much
alive andfﬁctive.

Se’verai¥’ of the clubs may arrange
function for the summer. The West-
moreland club oﬁicials are now plan.-
ning a picnic for the members and
their families. A -dance next winter
will be arranged by the Beaver county
club.‘ The Jeff county club, clue to
Fred Jor‘dan’s activities in thatfcounty
will doits share at all times. *

er. Mr. Guthrie has not been «heard
in public since his return from the

land of the Mikado and itvis a distinct ‘

compliment that the has agreed to
adress the graduates, of his Alma

has been identified with our institution
in all its important projects and has
a burning loyalty f0r'Old Pitt. His
message to the graduates——-young and

be very inspiring. -. A

Alumni association and to many other
University men who are not in the
association but, who are loyal Pitt
men. If additional notices are desired
or alumni who have received them
wish some sent» to any particular men,
be sure to advise. ,We» have a very
scattered list of alumni and the ad-
dresses are changing “continuously so
that it isrpossible many .who might
care to attend will be missed. Every-
one who ever attended the University
is cordially invited,‘ whether’ they re-
ceive an oﬁicialv-notice or no . f ..

The members of the Senior cl-as
will all receive a special letter from
the Secretary, advising them of the’
affair and urging their attendance.
This letter tells of the plan whereby
all who attendreceive a paid up‘mem-
bership in the General Alumniasso-
ciation for a half year or until Janu-
ary 1, 1916. They are entitled to THE

Delivering but a mediocre quality of
 , ball the Blue and Gold base ball rep-
resentatives were able to defeat the
, , Carnegie delegation by the small
"2 margin of 4-2, in the clash at Forbes
‘ ' Field last Tuesday.
 The charges of Sam Wilson came
‘ across with their registrations early
in the game when in the third‘ in-
ning they hung up what proved to be
, a safe lead. The oppenents from
‘ acros sthe valley made their mark in
the eighth when they proﬁted by
Mart’s momentary wildness and the
6. errors of his hackers and overcame all
. , am‘. one run of the Pitt margin.~ Pitt

‘pushed over another run in their half
‘of the same deal and therewith ended
 the scoring of the game.

In the early stages it appeared that
Pitt was to repeat the history of the
ﬁrst meeting between these rivals. As
usual, the University men entered the
contest with a vim that carried their
opponents momentarily off their feet.
 _ During the ﬁrst inning Hines was

f , touched freely but the ﬁne work of
‘ . ;his Plaid support saved him from be-
ing scored upon. The second inning
was all Pitt. Healy and his cohorts
were not to be denied. DeHart began
» ' the carnival with a red hot single and
advanced to second on_ Hastings’ sac-
riﬁce. Peck’s healthy larrup chased
the Spalding for a triple «on which
DeHart rode home. Hart was out.
Matson raised a Texas over Oeﬂinger.
5 _He them stole second and took third
. when Lain’s peg wentwild. Morrow
drew a pass. Morrow and Matson
_ pulled a double steal and Matson’s

A was the third run of the inning.
'Engle_hardt was out.

The credits made by the Tech_men
came in the eighth when Hart issued
.’ Oefﬁnger a pass. Kesner lived
I ' through Peck’s error and Lain walked,
ﬁlling the bases. Kreider drew life
 at first when Hart smothered his at-

' tempted squeeze and cut Oeﬁinger off
at the plate. Humphrey unhooked a
, single. Kesner scored, follewed by
T " Lain when Eng1ehardt’s homeward
peg went wild. Matson fell in an at-
tempt to block the throw which Hart
recovered and tagged Kreider, when
that individual attempted to score
A from ﬁrst on the play.‘

“Al” Hart spiked the mound for the
V Blue and Gold defenders while-Hines
oﬁiciated for Tech. Both men pro-
duced°a good line. Hart was on the
job and constantly master.of the sit-
, uation with the exception of a ‘mom-
entary relapse in the next to the last
event when Tech secured their tallies.
He recovered, however, and was as in-
vincible during the ﬁnal toss as he
had been earlier in the game. Con-
sidering the butchering suffered by
Hines in the ﬁrst contest, that worthy
. performed a considerable feat in hold-
I ing the Pitt sluggers to as close a
margin as he did.

The ﬁnal game- of the annual series
captured by the Pitt men at Forbes
field was another of the long array of
triumphs over the wearers of the
plaid. Football, track and baseball

Judging from the returns on this

seem that the best way to play out a
tennis schedule is to hire a nice, open
attic and install grass. By following
this system, most of the players will
be saved from drowning on the courts.

The eighth day of the month of
diamonds and of mistakes for remedy
by the divorce courts ;will find the
Varsity track team pitted against
their rivals -at State College. The
clash of Monday next will be the final‘
one of the track season. The Blue and
Gold spurners of the cinder paths are
in the ﬁnest possible condition and
are conﬁdent of giving the Center
countians the trial difficult on their
own grounds.

mitt. Lamb will undoubtedly be one
of the up—state team’s best scorers,
and Hammitt, the State captain, will
be unbeatable on the hurdles. Sutlier-

discus throw and the result of this
battle between the giants will be an

FIRST YEATT BUNCH
EEATs- ASPINWALL

Last Wednesday, when the Fresh-
men were about to start out for
Aspinwall, it was found that they
were short four-ninths of theirteam,
or to be more deﬁnite, only ﬁve of the
men were on hand. But that did not
stop them. By enrolling their man-
ager and by commandeering three

 

. other unsuspecting males, they ﬁnal-

ly rounded out their team. With this
nondescript lineup they valiantly as-
sailed the Aspinwall high school nine
and emerged victorious 6 to 4.’ De-
Walt pitching for the Freshmen had
little trouble in holding the high
school boys safe. The game scheduled
with Sewickley on Monday were called
off on account of wet grounds.

_ When “Steve” ﬁrst left the Min-

with the Warren team of the Inter-
state League. It seems that all the
berths had been ﬁlled in that club be-
fore Dillon appeared on the scene. At
least, the big “sticker was not even
given a chance in .the lineup, and was
transfered to the Jamestown club.
“Rabbit” Webb of the Jamestown
team had been watching the work of
this ‘University star through all of
last season, was satisﬁed that he
had the goods, and accordingly signed
him when he was offered by Warren.

    BEAT PITT

Captain Healy’s base ball cohorts
were billed to stack up against the
strong nine representing West Vir-
ginia University for two games, Fri-
day and Saturday. The game on Fri-
day went to the Mountaineers via the
shut-out routs, Captain Hersey’s men
holding the Blue and Gold squad safe
while they garnered three tallies.
Stung by this defeat, the Smoky city
boys were out for revenge and were
leading the next day when he game
was called on account of rain. The
win on Friday for the West Virgin-
ians ties them with Pitt for the tri-
angular championship between these
two institutions and W. & J.. Pitt
was victorious on Trees ﬁeld earlier
in the season, while the Morgantown
crew has triumphed over the Red and
Black. Pitt still has two games to
play with the Washiggtonians and the
result of these mee Tings may decide
the championship.

Friday’s contest turned out to be a
pitching duel between two south paws,
Langdon twirling for the Pennsylvan-
ians and Barron occupying the box. for
the Mountaineers. The big port-sider
from Altoona was wilder than his op-
ponent, walking ﬁve men. and hitting
another. Although allowing only six
safe hits, two of which were doubles,
he lost out by mixing them in with
free passes to the initial station and
because of errors by his support.
Barron was in better form and set
the Pitt boysdown hard. He also
allowed six hits, but two of these were
scratchy. Pitt had men on bases al-
most every inning, but old man timely
hit was lacking and no varsity run-
ner was" able to complete the circuit.
This victory marked Barron’s second
shutout voctory for the week. ' Six
men of either team whiffed the air
at the opposing pitcher’s slants, ﬁve
of Pitt’s strikouts coming when there
were men on bases waiting to be sent
across the pan.

The game abounded in sensational
plays, both sides contributing grand-
stand features. Captains Healy and
Hersey played stellar engagements
for their respective teams, Captain
Hersey having eight putouts in middle
ﬁeld. Englehardt and DeHart both
contributed errors that spelt runs for
the opposition, 'West Virginia having
only one earned to their credit. In
number of misplays West Virginia
was worse than Pitt,’ but they did not
count in the result. Morrow, playing
the short ﬁeld, was charged with three
misplays. Hersey, Fulton and Simon
purloined sacks on Matson, while De-
Hart was the only man to garner one
at Fidler’s expense.

The game Saturday promised to be
a tight ﬁght between A1 Hart and
Fulton. The scrap was called at the
end of the third round with Pitt lead-
ing 2 to 1. Both pitchers were pitch-
ing ﬁne ball and were being backed
up with sensational support. Fulton
was the pitcher Pitt defeated earlier
in the season, and they entertained
high hopes of repeating the dose. The
heavy downfall of rain killed any hope

of ﬁnishing the game that day.

DR. K. is. LASIILEY
AWARDER SCHOLARSHIP.

 

Announcement was made last week
by John Hopkins University that Dr.
Karl Spencer Lashley, who secured a
degree of M. S. from the University in
1911, has been awarded one of the
Johnston scholarships of that insti-
tution. Dr. Lashley is a resident of
Davis,  ,Va., and a graduate of West
Viriginia University.  :=

BASEBALL TEAM AEATTT  
TAcAEEs sTATE NINE

Coach Wilson’s warriors leave on
Friday night for State College, where
on Saturday afternoon, before Com-
.mence"ment crowd, they will face the
State team for the second time this
season.

In the ﬁrst contest between these
nines, the State bunch came off victor-
ious by virtue of a rally in the clos-
ing inning that netted them six runs.
These tallies and Hesselbacher’s

‘brand of hermetically sealed pitching

proved too much for the Blue and
Gold. _

Langdon is slated to hurl for Pitt
on this occasion, as in the earlier
battle, and it is quite likely‘ that Hes-
selbacher will again perform for the
Center country artists. If this guess
.works out, it will be the fourth time

in as many games between Pitt and

State in the past- two seasons that
Langdon has opposed Hesselbacher on
the mound. In every. game so far
both men have finished the full nine
innings, so Saturday’s engagement
will probably make thirty-six innings
contested between these two hilltop-
pers. State’s “Big George” has come
out ahead in two of his three entries
so far, so that it will be up to Lang-
don to hold his opponent even in this
gamea

So far ’as is known, no changes are
contemplated in the Varsity lineup.
It’s true that the present arrange-
ment hasn’t produced much in the vic-

tory line, but 1915 is an off year for

Pitt in baseball, and shifting the men
about seems to do little good. Every
man is working hard, but‘ evidently
the charm is off.

" EHTTTSHPRQHTA

PITT COMES  
BUT AHEAD I
AT CITATION

Another triumph was registered for
the Pitt track team Memorial Day
when it packed home the trophy for
the Crafton track meet. Though
crippled by the absence of a number
of their most consistent point gain-
ers and hampered by the absence of
all weight events the Blue and Gold
spike shoe artists managed to come
across with a splendid win for the
University. '

McMaster won second place in the

hundred. Cook ran splendidly and an-
nexed the ﬁrst place in the 220-yard
dash. Gnumbling, the dependable
from Johnstown, chalked up a win in
the one lap run for colleges. Mc-
Master took both the broad jump and
the pole vault. The relay race was
one and one-third miles in length, ow-
ing to the iregularity of the, track.
The suporters of the Blue and Gold
landed second place in this special
event.

The onemile run was distinctly of
a Blue and Gold tint. McClure came
in at the head of the string. Gantos
was pushing him. hard for the ﬁrst
honors, but was compelled to be con-
tent with the second ribbon.

The result of this meet can in no
wise be classed as a representative
effort" of the University track team.
A large number of the men who can
be regularly depended upon to were
out of the affair altogether. Another,
factor in the showing of the team was‘
the fact that no weight events were
listed. In the Tech meet the weight
men handed the track team a lead ofi
24 points to start on, a fact which
Bur-
well, Sheehan, Livermore, and the en-
tire. delegation’ of weight men were
out of the team on this occasion so
that the men who, produced the goods
and brought home the decision from
this encounter are deserving of the
highest mark of appreciation.

The points scored by the teams in
the meet of Monday were ‘as follows:
Pitt 39; P. A. A. 33; Tech 23; W. &
J. 10. »

ADD MNI '

SENIORS TO REGISTER

- AND ELECT SECRETARY.
Two things are asked of the mem-

bers of the ‘Senior classes by the Al-

umni Secretary, in addition to their

- attendance at the annual Commence-

ment banquet:
First: That all Seniors ﬁll out reg-

" istration card for the general infor-

mation of the alumni oﬁice.

Second: That a Life Secretary be
elected by them. .

The plan is for the undergraduate
schools-—-College, Engineering, Mines,
Economics and Education-——to elect

one Life -Secretary and for the Dental, _

Medical, Law and Pharmacy schools
to elect a separate one. This will be
ﬁve in all. The Life Secretary, as the
title indicates, will hold office per-
manently and should be in touch with
the Alumni Secretary at all times in
following up members of his class,
checking‘ and correcting their address-
es, getting them in the Alumni associ-
ation, boosting class reunions, etc.
The Yale University alumni system
—~the most effective, perhaps, in ..the
country-—-is founded on the Life Sec-
retary plan. At Pitt we want to
start this year and have a Life Secre-
tary elected for every outgoing class.
All the Senior classes have been
notiﬁed of this plan and asked to hold
their elections before Commencement.
Registration cards have also been
provided, a number of the schools hav-
ing already turned them back. The
Dental, Economics and Pharmacy sen-
iors have been especially prompt in
this. Will the_others please get busy?
The Senior registration cards tell
the Alumni office of the name, ad-
dress, etc., of the Seniors and by
means of the line showing name of
some person who will always know the
Seniors address, we are able to have
a “line” on the gradutes all the time.
If in future years mail is returned un-
called for, we will check with this

address and locate _the party.

 

 

TENNIS TAATcTTEs MAT    

YET BE PLAYED OFT

The tennis matches with Penn ‘State
and Carnegie Tech were both post-
poned on account of rain. These
matches between the three best col-
legiate tennis teams in this end of the
state were expected to devote the col-
legiate championship of Western
Pennsylvania on the court. The Uni-

 

versity authorities are now negotiat-

ing with the management of both
these teams for games to be played
either next week or the following.
The matches with Penn State may
take place the same day that the dual
track meet or the baseball game be-
tween the two institutions. The ar- '
rangements for the game "with the
Plaid servers can be easily arranged
and will probably take place early
next week.

Announcement has been made that ,
the officials for the big football games
for next were selected at the con-
ference of football managers that was

held last week at Philadelphia.‘ Rep- .-

resentatives of eleven of the leading
educational institutions of the east
were present and the oﬂicials were
then appointed. Announcement of
Just who the men appointed totake
charge of the local games will be
made later. However the same offic-
ials that worked so satsifactory in the I
games here last year may be expected
to be back_on the Job_ again this fall
when the pigskin 1S kicked off.

  ANNUAL LIJNGHEUN

With an attendance of over 15.0
students, faculty, alumni and guests,
the annual School of Education lun-
cheon held last Saturday at the Hotel
Schenley, was productive of an en-
thusiastic school spirit. The luncheon
has been made an annual affair, and is
held in the afternoon, in order to
accommodate the large feminine ma-
jority in the school. The pedagogues
sat down shortly after one o’clock, in
the room south of the ball-room. Dean
Will Grant Chambers acted as toast-
master, and during and between the
courses, as precentor for the “old fav-
orite” numbers which the assemblage
sang a la Wednesday chapel. The
faculty, alumni, seniors, juniors,
sophomores and freshmen occupied
separate tables, and there was even
one table populated exclusively by
men. '

The formal program included short
addresses by Chancellor McCormick,
Secretary Linhart, Registrar Frost,
and Mrs. McCormick, all of whom ex-
pressed, pleasure at the
growth, strength and hospitality of
the School of Education. Anthony L.
Goldberger, ’14, spoke on behalf Of
the alumni, voicing the hope that the
male element in the school might ex-
perience a steady increase.

Each class was scheduled to contri-
bute to the pleasure of the occasion
by a performance of “home talent.”
For the Freshmen, Miss Verna Irons
gave _a reading, “The Soul of the
Violin.” Miss Lillian Wood, . the
Sophomore representative, was un-
able to be present. Paul J. Cook, of
the Junior class, sang a tenor solo,
“Who Knows”? The Seniors had the
real stunt of the afternoon. It was
engineered by Miss Isabelle McKen-
nedy, the class president, and consist-
ed of an adaptation of the Mother
Goose rhyme of “Four and Twenty
Blackbirds.” Under her manipulation,
a. huge blue and gold paper pie,em-
mitted sundry feathered species, (pic-
tured, of course), each of which had
a clever verse attached, relating to
some local celebrity or incident. The
luncheon broke up after “Alma Mat-
er” had been sung.

The committee in charge of the
arrangements consisted of the retir-
ing school senate: G. Fred Ashe,
chairman, and the Misses Isabelle
Kennedy, Elsie Harker, Ellen Koch,
Myra McBride, Marjorie Duff and
Eleanor Spangler.

AGED EDUGATDR
ANSWERS suuuous

With the death of Dr. Jeremiah
Tingley, last Saturday, one of Alle-
gheny county’s oldest educators was
called away. But a few weeks ago
he celebrated his eighty-ninth birth-
day and received a number of his
former pupils who came to visit and
congratulate him. .

Dr. Tingling was for twenty—ﬁve
years professor of science at Alle-
gheny College,» giving to that institu-

 

tion a ‘national reputation for that

department. In 1888, he accepted the
chair of chemistry at the West Penn

’ Medical College, which later became

a part of the University of Pittsburgh.
A little later he was asked to take
charge of the chemistry department
of Allegheny high school, remaining
there for over twenty years. A couple
of years ago, he retired from active
service and spent his last few years
among his books. While at Alle-
gheny, he gave the high school the
reputation of having the best prepar-
atory scientiﬁc course in this part of
the state.

LE CERCLE ‘FRANCAIS

The French club will hold its clos-
ing meeting of the year on Frida.y

When one enters upon the study of
the early prehistoric ages in the de-
velopment of the earth, sooner or later
he ﬁnds amid the accounts of the
mastodons the name of the recently
discovered but far-famed diplodmocus;
and closely united with that history
will be ‘the name of William Jacob-
I-Iolland, author, artist, naturalist,
museum director, clergyman, and edIu-
cator, who was director of Carnegie
Museum at the time the expedition
was sent out to discover the famous
animal.

William _J. Holland was born at
Bethany, a small Moravian mission
station in the island of Jamaica on
August 16, 1848, his fateher being a
native of North Carolina and a mis-
sionary to the island. The former’s
early education was secured in the
schools of the Moravian church, and
in 1869, he graduated from Amherst
College with the degree of A. B. His
M. ‘A. was received from the same
institution in 1872, and he was or-
dained in the Moravian church the
same year, being assigned to a church
in Philadelphia. After a‘ course in the
Princeton Theological Seminary where
he graduated in 1874, he was ordained
in the Presbyterian ministry and ap-
pointed as pastor of the Belleﬁeld
Presbyterian church of this city, where
he remained until 1891. At that time
he became chancellor of the Western
University of Pennsylvania, as suc-
cessor to Milton _B. Goff, LL. D., who
had served in that capacity since 1883.
During Dr. Holland’s regime, the Uni-
versity grew rapidly until it attained
second rank, at least in point of num-
bers, among the institutions of learn-
ing in Pennsylvania. Under his ad-
ministration the departments of medi-
cine, law, dentistry, and pharmacy
were added to the collegeiate and
engineering -schools, and the total
iiumber of _ students multiplied eight-

old. .

During this period of his life, de-
grees were heaped upon him by the
universities of the country. 11 1886
Washington and Jefferson gave him
a Ph. D., this being followed with a
Sc. D. from the same source in 1902;
Amherst conferred upon him the de-
gree of D. D. in 1888; the degree of
LL. D. was given to him by Dickin-
son in 1896, New York University in
1897, and by St. Andrew’s University
of Scotland in 1905.

Early in life Dr. Holland became
deeply interested in natural science,
and he soon became a recognized au-
thority in zoology and paleontology.
In 1887, he was appointed by the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences and the
United States Navy department as
the naturalist of the U. S. Eclipse
expedition to Japan and to Africa in
1889. He was connected with the Car-
negie Museum from its ﬁrst concep-
tion, and was appointed‘ as its director
in 1897. He resigned from the chan-
cellorship of the University in 1901, at
the close of ten years of faithful serv-
ice. in order that he might devote all
of his time to the work of administer-
ing the complex affairs connected with
the Museum. In this position, he has
become noted for his able administra-
tion, and it has been his privilege to
see the Museum pass through almost
two decades of unexampled growth

CHOOSE NEW uwi
BOARD HEADS

(Continued from Page 1)

All the schools on the campus have
elected their representatives to serve
on the 1917 board, but owing to the
fact that the School of Pharmacy has
but a two—year course, there will be
no Junior class until the fall enroll-
ment next October, at which time the
pharmacists will ‘elect an editor, man-
ager and elector, who will without
further negotiations be incorporated
into the board as it stands today.

VVhile there is too little time "re-
maining of the present school year
to make very extensive progress on
the annnual, members of the board
are doing their utmost to formulate
a rough draft of the policy it intends
to pursue in the publication of the
annual. The ﬁrst business meeting
will be held today at“12:30’“lin- room
104 State hall. At this.meeting_all
possible arrangements will be ‘made
regarding the type of ‘write-ups to be
used the coming year‘, tl'i'e"-size and
binding of the book,7a‘nd[‘5tlie extent
and size of. the various} departments
into which the volume willf‘. be sub-
divided.  .-

Members of the board have express-
ed the opinion -that, as it: seemsgto
be the general feeling. of the ‘students
that a uniform size‘and ’sh‘ape"f‘or the
annual Junior Owl is desirable for the
catalogue and library, the board will
in all probability follow the example
of the Owl just issued with regard to
these particulars. The manager plans
to inaugurate his campaign for sub-
scriptionssfat the beginning of school
at the fall term, so tliatthere need be
no hesitation on the part of the Ad-
visory board in .granting permission
to proceed with the publication of the
book, and the progress of the work

' will not be obstructed, as it frequent-
ly has in past years.

Museum, 0 the “Annals” and the
“Memoirs.” When Andrew Carnegie

decided upon the gift of the library
to the city, Dr. Holland, was also
named as one of the original commis-
sion for its erection, and he has been
a trustee of the fund for its support.

An an author, Dr. Holland is per-
haps best known as the author of the
“Butterﬂy Book,” (1898) in which he
described all the butterflies north of
Mexico. But almost equally well known
are the “Moth Book” (1903), “The
Lepidoptera of the Celebes” (1889),
and “To the River- Platte and Back”
(1913). He is the author of numer-
ous scientiﬁc articles, his Work includ-
ing two hundred and twenty-ﬁve titles
published by various governments and
societies. He has named and describ-
ed almost one thousand species of liv-
ing things, mainly the fauna of Africa.

In connection with his varied activi-
ties, Dr. Holland has held many posi-
tions of honor and trust. Foreign
governments" as well as our national
societies have added their marks of
appreciation and recognition for his
efforts. He is at present the president
of the Entomological Society of West-
ern Pennsylvania; a fellow of the Zoo-
logical and Entomological Societies of
Washington,'New York, London, Ger-
many, France, and a number of others;
a member of the Pennsylvania His-
torical Society; a fellow of the Amer-
ican Association for the Advancement
of Science; an honorary member of
the Anthropological and Geographical
Society of Sweden; and many other
societies of like nature in both Europe
and America.» He is the vice-presi-
dent of the Carnegie Hero Fund Com-
mission, vice-president of the board
of trustees of the Western Theological
Seminary, and -a director of the
Chamber of Commerce.

Whenever he ﬁnds time in the
midst of his labors, Dr. Holland takes
great pleasure in painting, in which
he has shown talent and taste for
both landscapes and animals. One of
the productions from his brush is a
portrait of himself, presented to the
University.

2Although it is already decorated
with an imposing array of orders and
medals of all kinds, yet ever and
anon Dr. Holland appears with his
brush, removes the canvas from its
frame, and adds thereto the latest
acquisitions which he has made to his
laurels. He is a member of the Union
and University Clubs of Pittsburgh,
the Cosmos of Washington, and the
Authors of New York.

An appreciation of Dr. Holland is
perhaps best summed up in the fol-
lowing quotation: “In the depth and
breadth of scholarship, the varietyof
scientiﬁc subjects mastered, the nun‘-
ber and character of positions held,
and high standing in the realms of
science, he has no superior in this
country.”

DAVIS.’

A variety of highly interesting,
high grade photo plays has been ar-
’ranged for the ‘continuous perform-

ances at the New Davis Theatre dur-

ing the week beginning next Monday
morning, June 7th. It is worthy of a
particular note that the ﬁrst half of

the week will” have for its main at-.
/ tr_action Mary Pickford,
. popular player for the screen in all

the most
the world. The idolized star of the
Famous Players Film Company adds
another striking characterization of
her notable repertoire in the ﬁve-part
adaptation of Frances Hodgson Eur-
nett’s great drama of optimism, “The
Dawn of Tomorrow.” This is world-
famous stor yof _a young girl’s un-
faltering faith and triumphant re-
ward. Its production by the Famous
Players through the Paramount Pic-
ture Corporation is one of the most
brilliont achievements the drama of
the camera has recorded, and Miss
Pickford is said to have excelled in
point of artisticinterpretation even
her well remembered characterization
in “Tess of the Storm Country.”

The picture play feature for Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday is-entitled
“Brother Officers.” It is a splendid
military drama enacted by a company
of English players, and was played
at the Strand Theatre to ‘enormous
business over a protracted period. The
star of the play is Henry Ainley, who
interprets the role of.John Hinds. It
is all done in a fairly legitimate man-
ner and introduces scenes of great
power with ﬁdelity and sincerity. In
addition to “The Dawn of a Tomor-
row” and Brother Officers,” the bill
for the forthcoming week will include
a number of other thoroughly inter-
esting subjects.

GRAND.

To the traveler through ﬁlmland
there is nothing on the calendar mdre
seductive than the triple bill of feat-
ure photo plays secured for the next
week at the Grand Opera House, be-_
ginning Monday morning, June 7th.

Managers "Harry Davis and John P. ‘

Harris will show the ﬁrst picture ver-
sions of three of the most successful
of contemporary plays. These are:
‘.‘Little Miss Brown,” scheduled for
Monday and 'Iluesday (June 7and 8),
“Wormwood,” to be shown Wednesday
and Thursday, (June 9 and 10), “and
“Fighting Bobb” on Friday and Satur-
day (June 11-and 12). Here is variety
which is the spice of moving pictures
as well as of life; and here, too, is
pictorial effect of the most attractive
sort. V

“Little Miss Brown” is the most
successful play that has come from
the pen of that brilliant young dram-
atist, Philip Bartholmae. It is a
sprightly comedy dealing lightly and
quite unconventionally with the theme
of mistaken identity and the compli-

cations which arise therefrom, fur-.

nishing one laughiif situation after
another.

“Wormwood” is a dramatization of
the novel of the same name by Marie
Corelli and is one of the most vital
throbbing, realistic and
‘stories ofithe weaknessess and pas-
sions of modern society that has ever
been penned. Indeed it is the most
widely-read novel the popular Miss
Corelli has given the reading public.

“Fighting Bob” is a drama of a
revolution in a Latin-American coun-
try, adapted from the original play
of the same name by Edward E. Rose.
It presents, in its titular role Orrin
Johnson- and in the supporting cast
Oliv-e Wyndham. The picture was
made by the B. A. Rolfe photo play
company and reaches a newer and still

: higher plane in sensational animated
I photography than has yet been achiev-

ed. In addition to these leading feat-
ures, the Grand bill will include a
variety of pleasant comedies, and per-
formances will run continuously from
10 A. M. until 11:30 P. M.

states to work during the summer.
Besides the large number ﬁnding em-
ployment in the steel mills and coal
mines of Pennsylvania,‘-a large num-
ber have found positions with gold,
iron and copper mines. All this em-
ployment is arranged by Dean H. B.

The School of Mines requires every
student to do practical work during
the three summers of his university
course. The students will take em-
ployment on the engineering corps,
with the timbering squad or any other
labor position that may be assigned
to. them by the company which em-
ploys them. They receive the same

there are men, women and children in

speaker, who presented the objects of

“The G. A. R. does not wish to stim-
ulate the passions of the young people
to warlike measures but to promote
peace and to make our nationthe star
of hope to every nation oppressed by
the country that thinks ‘might is
right.’ War is a scourage and should
not be considered by any country un-
less absolutely necessary. We must
tread the paths of peace for we can-
not have prosperity and success and
be at war. The aimof ‘the G. A. R.
is to invite no passions against anyone
but to cultivate peace.”

Col. Allyn, the last speaker, dwelt
on the evils and horrors of war in gen-
eral._ He touched upon the economic
losses sustained by war. He said in
part:

“War is promoted by preparedness
and a nation is either prepared or not
prepared. There is no such thing as
semi-preparedness. There are three
motives for making war; self-defense,
domination and cannibalism. The de-
sire to dominate is the cause of most
modern wars. War is a relic of bar-
barism and the only excuse for war is
self-defense. It is the scourage of the
human race and in the present con-
ﬂict we should use every possible
means to remain_ neutral.” Col. Allyn
