Committee Set Up to Study
Pitt Band Race   Policy

A committee to study the

policy of the Pitt Band with re-

gard to the admission of colored students was formed late
Friday afternoon by vice-chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald.

Chairman of the committee is Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,

dean of the school of business administration. Members of the

committee are Col. Edward Kelly, head of the University

ROTC regiment; Theodore W. Bid-
dle, acting dean of men; Dr. Asher
lsaacs, professor of economics; and
Dr. Carroll Amundsen, professor
of history.

The committee will meet this af-
ternoon at 3 o’clock in Dr. Lanfear’s
office. '

The main issue confronting‘ the
committee will be the exclusion of
Charles Rickmond, a_colored stu-
dent, from the Pitt band. The com-
mittee has invited, and will invite
several students and faculty and
administration members to offer in-
formation on the Rickmond affair.

Irwin Rosen, editor of the Pitt
News, whose editorial, “As One To
Thee?” first brought the matter to
the attention of higher University
administrative officials, has been
asked by the committee to present
‘those facts which led him to write
the editorial.

Also appearing before the group
will be Rickmond, who will tell of
his attempts to get into the hand,
his refusal, and his subsequent ef-
forts’ since last fall.

Among those whom Dr. Lanfear
will probably call before the com-
mittee in his attempt to ﬁnd the
nature and causes of Rickmond’s
exclusion from the band will be
Robert L. Arthur, director of the
band, and Captain Ramon C. Dou-
gan, drill-master of the band.

American Association for Health}
Physical Education, and Recreation
conducted its joint annual conven-
tion with the Pennsylvania state
association in the Hotel Schenley.
April 29, 30, and May 1, 2, with
members of the Pitt faculty taking
a prominent part.

The society, a professional organ-
ization, which is composed of the
outstanding men in the field of
physical education, meets in con-
vention every year for the exchange
of ideas and the discussion of prob-
lems in the ﬁelds of health, physi-
cal education, and recreation.

The feature of this year's conven-
tion was “What of Tomorrow," 9.
speech delivered by Dr. E. W. Ja-
oobsen, dean of the School of Edu-
cation.

Mr. Carl Olson, Pitt's track coach
was given an award for “standing
preeminently in the coaching ﬁeld.”
Mr. C. W. Morgan, Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, Mr. Robert Hoel, Mr. Karl H.
Oermann, and Mr. Olson, all mem-
bers of the Pitt faculty took par-
ticularly active parts in the plan-
ning of the convention.

All students who expect to en-
roll &' student teaching the first
or second semester, 1942-43,

_" will moot today at 2:30 o’clock; in

tember. Following conversations
with Mr. Arthur and with Captain
Dougan, it was explained to Rick-
mond at that time that because it
would hamper the efficiency and ex-
pediency of band performance to
have a Negro member, it was im-
possible to let him play.

- Despite urgings to drop the mat-
ter, Rickmond began a campaign
to do away with the no-Negro rul-
ing in the band. He got the sup-
port: of the YMCA ethnic minori-
ties commission, who contacted
Captain Dougan, Mr. Arthur, and
others, through Y secretary Bill
Hammaker.

The matter was brought to the

attention of the Pitt News about a.‘

week ago. Following conferences
with Hammaker and band director
Arthur and Rickmond, the editorial
was written to appear in last Wed-
nesday’s paper.

The committee was created Fri-
day. lt meets today. lts ﬁndings
and recommendations will appear
in Wednesday's Pitt News.

Grant increases

Aid to Nurses

Victory scholarships for students
in the pre-nursing program have
been made available by a grant of
$20,000 from the A. W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust to the
University's School of Nursing.

This is the ﬁrst grant that has
been made to assist nursing stu-
dents in the two years of college
work which precede the profession-
al work. The Nursing Council on
National Defense has estimated
that 31,200 registered nurses will
be needed in 1942.

Young women graduating from
high school this spring will be able
to enroll in the accelerated program
at the University in June and be
ready to enter the hospitals in the
Medical Center a year from Sep-
tember.

Plans Now Complete

For Summer Session

Plans have been completed for
the start of the “victory session” at
the University of Pittsburgh dur-
ing the summer, Dr. Frank W.
Shockley, director of the summer
session, announced today.

Students will plan their summer
semester schedules in the offices of
the deans. With the exception of
the School of Applied Social Sci-
ences, all schools and divisions, un-
dergraduate, graduate, and profes-
sional, will participate in the ac-
celerated program.

Stamp Sales
Reach New

High Mark

Alpha Epsilon Phi, women’s so-
cial fraternity, aided by the sales
staff of the battleship drive com-
mittee, carried the defense stamp
campaign to new heights last Wed-
nesday.

Largely responsible for the new
records was the success attained in
bond sales, which set a record of
$2,774.70. ‘

Stamp sales surpassed all exist-
ing records, as salesmen reached
a greater number of individual stu-
dents than had ever before been

contacted for sales. Total stamp-—

sales for the day amounted to
$346.50.

, Campaign efforts now have net-
ted $12,861.20, making an aver-
age of $1,100 per week for 11

weeks.

“There is still a lot of room for
expansion before the drive hits its
aim of a 25c stamp per student per
week,” Richard Hartz, BA43, au-
diting committee head, said.

Now that the drive is receiving
general acclaim, Herbert Gall, M43,
chairman, has been called to Ran-
dolph Field, Texas, to join the En-
gineers corps.

‘ Four sales days still remain be-
fore the present drive closes. Com-

-mittee members have deﬁnitely

promised a similar campaign to be
conducted during the summer sem-
ester.

Deﬁnite and concrete plans for the air-raid protection of
the Cathedral are now in their ﬁnal stages, and the date of
the ﬁrst practice drill will be announced soon, Dr. John J.
Geise, Cathedral air-raid warden, said today.

 

 

Geise Completes Air Raid Plans

Each classroom in the Cathedral has been established as
the basic unit of air-raid protection.

Air-raid instruction posters by which the system will be
operated will be provided in each classroom.

Officers Explain
Army and Navy

Reserve Plans

Navy oﬁicers . will explain the
Navy V-1 program to interested
sophomore and freshman men at a
9:30 o’clock meeting today in Fos-
ter memorial.

. The V-I program consists of pre-
liminary action necessary for ob-
taining commissions, either before
or after graduation, in the Air
force or as a deck or engineering
officer in the naval reserve.

On Friday Army Air corps oili-
cials will discuss at 10:30 o’clock in
Foster .memorial their new pro-
gram, the Air Force Enlisted ro-
serve, with all interested under-
graduates.

This course enables a student to
enlist now in the reserve and have
the assurance of continuing in
school.

Before this meeting Captain Carl ~

Russell and other army air officers
will address a meeting of air force
advisers in Foster memorial. These
advisers are the faculty members
of the colleges in this area who
have charge of recruiting and in-
forming students of the require-
ments and advantages of the course.

Excuses will be given to all stu-
dents who attend these meetings.

The Pitt News will publish on-
ly two more issues this semester,
this Wednesday and Friday. Pub-

lication will resume June 9.

Arthur Commissioned
Captain in Air Corps
William C. Arthur, instructor in
commerce, has been commissioned
a captain in the United States Army
Air Corps. After a six-weeks train-
ing course at Miami Beach, Fla.,

Mr. Arthur will begin duty in the"

combat intelligence department.

These posters are now being
printed.

They will show the instructor and
students in each classroom the lo-
cation of the area which they will
occupy during the raid alarm and
the route to be followed in reach-
ing the area. -

The area to be used by each class
during a raid has been designated
as the “raid area.”

The instructor in the classroom
at the sounding of the alarm will
act as warden for the class. This
arrangement makes efficient air-
raid protection possible even ‘H
spite of changing personnel.

In addition to the instructors
serving as air-raid wardens for

classes, each ﬂoor will be in direct I A

and complete charge of a ﬂoor cap-

tain with assistant wardens drawn 7

from , faculty members.

Each ﬂoor warden will have con-
trol over the four service units on
the floor — traﬂ'ic (moving stu-
dents and faculty to raid areas),
blackout, ﬁrst-aid, and ﬁre-ﬁghting.

The work of the entire system
will be coordinated by a headquar-
ters unit located in the basement
of the Cathedral and in direct
charge of Dr. Geise.

Moredetailed plans of the alr- A P
raid protection system will be pub-

lished in the News this week.

Dr. Geise added that as the air-
raid protection plans are complet-
ed, the work of these committees
will be drawn upon even more.
heavily. '

He revealed also that in the for-
mulation of these plans, trial evac-
uations were conducted in several
classes. The cooperation of the
students in these classes he de-
scribed as “superb.”

“The whole question of air-raid
protection is o'f the utmost gravity.
It is only through the complete
cooperation and willingness of all
to aid those responsible that a’ sys-
tem of air-raid protection can be
operated successfully. Lives may
depend upon the cooperation of all,"
Dr. Geise said.

Fraternities Adopt Accelerated Plants,

By RUTH SOBOTKA

For the ﬁrst time in University
history, social fraternities will be
active during the summer semes-
ter.

Nearly all houses will be open
this summer, and meals will be serv-
ed in most of them during June. T.

There are some very deﬁnite
rumors circulating around the Uni-
versity to the effect that- the fac-
ulty may abolish SFA and substi-

Vtute in its place another governing
body, or enlarge the functions of
Men's‘ Council so that that body
might assume those ‘responsibili-
ties left by this vacancy.

- However, these are only rumors,
and if SFA should accomplish the
task -of electing a president, they
may be dismissed as groundless.

   

Far be it from ‘us to rear ghost—heads in the
students’ serene sky, but can it not happen
liereas it did in London, as in Coventry, as
in Toklo? University buildings are not entire-

But the Cathedral will not be demolished
tomorrow,‘ possibly, never. That is what we
all hope, and yet we can’t sit back. on our
haunches and merely hope. We have to as-
sume even the worst that could happen on
this no longer isolated campus-—assume and
work. V

‘Fortunately, we have many faculty mem-
bers that realize the closeness of danger from
air raids and they have been working with a
will to protect students and other faculty
members that must come to the University

the greater part of the day. Whatlittle praise.

We can give them here, we give now.
And there are students helping in this job

of ﬁnding protectioniand the best -way to get

to it when an air raid signal sounds.

The other day Dr. John Geise, air raid
warden for the University, sounded out sev-
eral classes at random on how well they could

, evacuate classrooms if necessary. They were
on their toes. Their performance, according

to Dr. Geise was “superb.”

If tUniversity students were feather—head-
ed and scoffers, as they have been called, co-

operation from them would be something to‘

be doubted and hoped for; But they are not
feather—heads -and they realize was is not
play ’ ‘ p .

That is the_majority of them realize this.

‘There are a few whoconsider the war and

everything connected with it quite a lark and
nothing much to worry about. These will
probably bottleneck corridors when a siren
sounds, sit around and smile at each other
and at University people trying to_protect
themselves wisely and with system. _ .
They may not understand the importance
of the air raid protection plans rapidly be-
ing crystallized at the University. We know
where to consign those students now, but
that is just an opinion. When a bomb hits

where they should not have been, others will

consign them to the stupid-casualty list.

For Vt/orl< in Physical Education Field

By MIKE HERMAN
; At its annual business
' meeting last Thursday, the

Pennsylvania Association for
 ealth, Physical Education,

'0 nd Recreation honored Carl
.;:;; lson, track and ﬁeld coach at
 the University of Pittsburgh,
by making him one of the re-
cipients of their coveted serv-
, ice award.

The presentation of the
award was one of the features
‘of the Association’s four-day con-

, vention here in Pittsburgh, central
the Association’s four-day conven-
I tion here in Pittsburgh, central
‘ theme of which was “Civilian Fit-
ness.” Playing host to the gathered
conventioners was the faculty of
the Physical Education Depart-
ment of the University, with many
of!’ the exhibitions taking place in
he Cathedral Gym. ‘
Mr. Olson was given the award,
in the form of a bronze medallion,

COACH CARL OLSON
receives another award

the victory, of one that causes sur-
prised comment.

Coach Olson started his career
in the Army during World War I,
where he was a physical instructor;
From _there he moved to a coach-
ing spot at Froebel High School in
Gary, Ind. In 1932, Frank Shea
retired as track and ﬁeld coach at
Pitt, and the University wired for
Mr. -Olson to take his place.

The change was a good one, for
Coach Olson has brought the Pan-
thers up from the ranks of medi-
ocrity to being one of the top

teams in the nation. Climax of the
Pitt revival was the 1939 Penn
Relays", in which Pitt won all four
of the main events, sending power-
ful Fordham, N.Y.U., lCorneII, and
Michigan teams home without a
trophy.

The list of star track and ﬁeld
men produced at Pitt since 1932,
including men like John Woodruff,
Dick Mason, Bill Carter, Hap
Stickel, Al Ferrara, Charley Gong-
loﬁ’, and Bill Curtis, is in itself an
indication of the outstanding coach-
ing of Carl Olson.

result, were’ shutout. In only one in-

the strong local netmen,. and, as a _ I

throughout the entire year. It was‘
mainly through the efforts of De--

foe that the Phi Delt duo was able
to finish a full game ahead of the
pre-season favorites, Pi Kappa AI-
. pha twosome.

With “Chuck” Page bearing
most, of the pitching burden, the
PiKA’s jumped off to a sizeable
lead early in the season and made
it appear as if the current horse-
shoe race would be a walk away.
However, the Dithridge St. house
failed to produce another man of

Pag'e’s ability and as a result, the-

PiKA’s faltered when the pressure
was on.

In third place but far behind and
out of the championship running
was Phi Epsilon Pi. Generally re-
garded as one of the weakest teams
in the league, the Phi Eps pulled
one of the biggest surprises of the

race by edging out the SAE’s and
Phi Gams for the number three
spot.

Panther Linlcsmen

By ELAINE KAHN

NineLeaves for Eastern Jaunt   0

Coach Ralph Mitterling will get a chance to ﬁnd out just
how good his squad really is when it tackles the class of col-
legiate baseball circles this week.

The Panthers leave this afternoon for Philadelphia where
they play Temple University tomorrow. From there they will
drive to West Point for the game with Army on Wednesday,

and will return home Thursday

night.

All Temple has done is to win eighteen of its last twenty

games, and Army has a record of
six wins, one loss, and one tie for
the current season. Pitt’s baseball-
ers will have good reason to be
wary of the men from West Point,
for reserves are so plentiful.’ that
baseball Coach Walter French has

-not one, but two starting lineups

ready for action.

Furthermore, the Army squad
has a centerﬁelder named Hank
Mazur, who, if he plays baseball
anything like he plays football, is
reason enough for giving oppos-
ing coaches sleepless nights.

The Panthers who were rated be-
forehand as being a good ﬁelding,
but weak hitting club with very
doubtful pitching have managed to
confound all the pre—season dope.
All they have done so ‘far is to av-
erage ten hits and eight runs per
game and the pitching has been
well above average.

Strangely enough, it is in the
ﬁelding department that the team
has fallen apart. It seems as though
a game just isn't considered ofﬁ-A
cial unless there are ,three or four
errors committed, and it’s no se-
cret that poor ﬁelding rather than
anything else is responsible for
many of the so-called “hits."

The Pitt baseball team scored its
fourth consecutive triumph when
it came through with a 7-2 win
over Bucknell University’s Bisonsi
at Lewisburg Saturday afternoon.

High spot of the Panther victory
was the hurling of Bill McKee, who
allowed Bucknell but three scratch
hits. Chief Panther hitting power
came from Joe Wilk, who batted in
two of the Mitterlingmen runs, and
from George Jacobs, who got two
of Pitt’s seven safeties.

Pitt grabbed, an early, lead in the
first inning, when Wilk drove a
double into center, sending Jacobs
and Fisher, who had previously
