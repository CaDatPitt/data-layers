Redeveloped property holds promise for Oakland

Harrison Kaminsky
ﬂssistant News Edzitor

After helping construct the parking
garage for Magee‘-Womens Hospital of
UPMC, Gary Wilson will tackle a new

. multi-million‘-dollar project in Oakland.

Wilson, an urban planner and realtor
representing a development team work-
ing as MWK Forbes LLC, recently pulled‘
the trigger on a proposal that began in»-

2009. The team will work this summer
to demolish the vacated 48,o0o-square-
foot Allegheny County Health Department
building, as well as an adjacent boarded-up
house on Forbes Avenu_e in Oakland’. The
team will build an apartment building and
an office building in the cleared space.
On- Tuesday, Feb. 4, the Allegheny
County Council voted unanimously to

q approve the project.

The sale of the property, which will

close on Feb. 28, cost Wilson and his team
$4.9 million, and the team will use cash
and loans to fund the project.’

The total cost of the redevelopment
projectis expected to be “in excess of $30
million,” according to Wilson, who also

i said construction should begin by the end
of the year.

According to Wilson, his team won the

APARTMENTS H

bid for the project in May 2009, but the ‘

team could not ﬁnalize the contract to
start building until last year because "of
the bad economy. '

Wilson, whose father  grandfather-‘  _
attended ’1fitt,‘previously workedjfor’ Na-’._ 
tional Development Corporation, a 1’-°eal’ 

es_tate»development business based in
Pittsburgh. During his time with the Na-
tional Development Corporation, Wilson

did land assemblage work, which ensures‘

the availability of energy sources for dif-
ferent properti_es.~ I ‘ H —
. He did land assemblage for the con-

_ struction of several buildingsin Oakland,

including a 5o_,oo0—squ'are-_foot oflice
building for the Regional Industrial ‘De-

velopment Corporation on Craft Avenue, A «

housing facilities primarily occupied by

Carnegie Mellon University students on ' _
Fifth Avenue and Neville Street and Oak-

land’sHampton Inn.

Although Wilson was not involved, the
National Development Corporation was
also responsible for the construction of
the parking garage underneath Soldiers &
Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum.

The bidding process was certainly a
competitive one, but Wilson said his team
had the winning proposal because of its
experience in complicated urbanland
development. ‘ H

“We were competitive because we’re

not simply buying the property and put- ’

ting just one use on it,” Wilson said. “We’re
putting multiple uses on it: an apartment
building and an office building.”

Wilson said he was optimistic about

ﬁnding tenants for the 120,000-square- ”

foot ofﬁce building coming to Forbes'Av-
enue across from Magee—Womens Hospital
because of Oakland’s historically low va-
cancy rates for office space.

The 120,000-square—foot apartment-

. building, which will include between 120

and 160 housing units and studio living
spaces, will provide housing for students
and long-term residents.

‘ But according to Wilson, an apartment
building wasn’t inpthe initial plans. i

“It was supposed to be a hotel. Because
of the demand we’re’~"se’eing, the demand
for higher-end, newer apartments in Oak-
land, it seems that we’re putting the space
to a more in-demand use,”_.Wilson said.

He is not worried about the demolition

and construction process affecting Pitt .

students in their commutes to and from
class each day. _

“We’ll eventually have construction ma-
terials entering the projecton Forbes, but
that won’t. happen until the end of 2014,”

he said, “The roads are wide enough on
Forbes that construction materials will be ~
able to move in and out of the site pretty _

easily.” » 

Wilson added that the top floors, of the. _
new apartment building will have river.

views. , V v ’
“It’ll be exciting, because there, will

be new places for students to live if they

want,” he said. M '

believes the new apartment complex will

beneﬁt the student body.
_ “Any efforts to revitalize areas in Oak-
land can enhance Pitt students’ overall

- living ’exp’erience,”.he.said in an email.

Current landlords will also have added
competition with the additional housing.
A “Adding new housing to thearea will

have the effect of putting pressure on

current local landlordsto maintain their

properties — sothis, too, should be a posi-_ 3

tivefor Oakland residents,” Fedele said.
Fedele said if Wilson’s team abides by
traﬂic laws, the construction would not

. negatively affect the student body or com-

muters. _

“Any constructionalong the For.b_es— or 1

Fifth-Avenue corridors is likely to impact

commuters who use those routes and ad-.

jacentroutes to some extent,’ but the city

requires developers to adhere to traffic .

control and truck route plans, which the

city must approve,” he said. H l

V-DAY~

Charisse Pearson—Bey, a sophomore major-
ing in ﬁnance, attended the event to support
the fraternity and said she had never been
to an event like that before.

“I didn’t get any massages, but I did take
advantage of the refreshments,” Pearson-
Bey said.

Zabi Mulwa, a junior majoring in African
studies and anthropology, said that the ﬁrst
thing she wanted to try that evening was a
back massage. T

Mulwa also attended the ﬁrst event Kap-

pa Alpha Psi offered as part of its series of «
.. W gr. 2;»

 

Valentine’s Day-themed events, which was
atalk about HIV and AIDS on Feb. 4.

At the event, Vianca Masucci, a sex
educator with the Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force 4 a group that works to support and
empower individuals with HIV and AIDS

— providedan informative presentation .

about STDs and protective methods to an
audience of about 11 students.

“It was like a safe-sex event,” Mulwa —

said. “It was actuallylpretty interesting.”
Wilson said the fraternity held the talk
on safe sex as a way to promote expressing
affection in a healthy manner.
Wilson said he liked that women could
come to an event especially to feel appreci—‘

ated. The fraternity members decorated _,

the ballroom with pink and white decora-
tions, and the women who attended helped
themselves to food and mingled with the
fraternity members while music echoed
through the room. ’

~ According to Gary Perkins, a gradu— A

V ate student at Point Park University and a
member of the Kappa Alpha Psi city-wide .
chapter, the fraternity has held Valentine’s “

Day-themed events since around 2008,
when he joined the chapter.

“What we really want to say here is to
appreciate females,” Perkins said. “It’s Feb-
ruary, it’s close to Valentine’s Day, so it’s
good to appreciate the ladies.”

Perkins said the fraternity members
moved the event, normally held at the
_William Pitt Union, to the O’Hara Student
A Center to have more space. But the mem-
bers received fewer attendees than they
expected. p
A “The thing is, with this weather, we’ve
had less of a turnout this year,” Perkins said.
' Perkins said the low number of people
resulted in a low-key event and allowed
the people in attendance to simply enjoy
the atmosphere. A
,' “It’s really based on individual prefer-

— ence,” Perkins said.

transportation and other services, which
will make life easier forthe residents liv-
ing there.

, “It sets afocus and priority on maintain-
ing the integrity of traditional housing on
the outskirts of the community. That’s not
where wewant to see an apartment being

developed,” she said.

Wanda Wilson said she doesn’t believe

, the location of the project will disturb local

families, either. . , .

“In this case, the apartment [building]
is in thecore of the commercial district.
It’s not disrupting traditional single—family
life,” she said. . -

She also expressed that she expects to
see more of these types of developments
sprouting up around the Oakland com-
munity in the near future." l A 

“A lot of developers are interested. It’s
another reason why the neighborhood has
a master plan to put forth a vision for the
community,” she said. “In a proactive way,
’we’re putting ourselves -in a good position
because we alreadyhave it in place. We
can have conversations with developers

. to see whether or not they are in line with

v

the vision, as well.” . V
Wanda Wilson said the project is a
great step to continue building the local

‘ economy.

“This is the diversity we like to see.

More people living near the retail district A f
and additional people from a wide variety ‘
of income levels will help spark the market

for maybe some additional businesses to

' consider Oakland,” she said.I

these numbers don’t support the idea that
STEM majors are the sole path to employment
— even if policymakers continue to do so.
That certainly does not mean that stu-
dents should stop studying in these ﬁelds, nor
does it mean universities should stop support-

in these ﬁelds are necessary for society and
rewarding for students. And an education

MUSIC  
‘Brazilian

Grace Kelly

When Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil-came
to the Byham Theater last year, he had
people dancing in the aisles. Unable to
stop the tidal wave of dancing and sing-
ing, the theater ushers threw up their
hands in defeat; This is the effect Brazil-
ian music can have on people, whether
the listeners understand the Portuguese
lyrics said or not. a '

This music, with genres including
sultry samba, bumping bossa nova and
charged Tropicalia, are all part of the

f grand echelon of Brazilian music that you

can hear every Friday from 6 to 7 p.m.
on the local WRCT 88.9 show “Brazilian
Radio Hour.” V
The show (which in Portuguese is
called Cantinho Brasileiro no Radio)

was the brainchild of Pittsburgh—based.

Brazil native Carla Leininger, who is a
web marketing project manager for Ea-
ton Corporation; a power management
company. Leininger started “Brazilian
Radio Hour” in 2004 to spread aware-
ness of Brazilian music and culture, as

versitytof sounds from Brazil. Leininger

ian segment of the program, which had
originallyﬂbeen part of the broader “Latin

Radio Hour’ brings a taste of Bossa Nova to the iBurgh

As the program began to grow in
popularity, Leininger saw the need to
create herown show separate from the
“Latin American Magazine.”

A “By 2004 it was getting more difﬁ-t
cult to have everything we wanted,” she
said, ‘-‘so we decided to apply for our own
show. It became a bigger commitment

and a weekly independent Show solely .

dedicated to music from Brazil.”

The show has taken off since then "

with a widévariety of listeners around
Pittsburgh. With a sizeable number of
Brazilians l_iving in Pittsburgh (Leininger
estimates it can range from 500 to 1000
at any given time), the audience who

Ho|lywood’s newest trend? Youn

lBritnee Meiser
For The P2’/:1’ News

The young—adult ﬁlm “Vampire Academy” was
released in theaters just last week, but hype
surrounding the project has been circulating
pop culture forums and social media websites
since production began. Anticipation forthe
potential blockbuster, however, had little to do
with the premise of the picture, itself, and very
much to do with the bestselling young—adult
book series on which it is based.

This is a growing trend in Hollywood.
“Vampire Academy” isjust the ﬁrst of many
popular young—adult novel—to—ﬁlm adapta-

V tions set to appear on the big screen this year.

While some seem likely to match the success
of their paperbound predecessors, it is ap-
parent that not all will be as successful — or
even worth seeing, for that matter — as the
likes of “The Hunger Games.”

One of the ﬁrst of such ﬁlms to debut this
year will be the adaptation of “Divergent” by

Veronica Roth. “Divergent” is a dystopian
novel some critics compare to “The Hunger
Games.” The concept alone is enough to grab
anyone’s attention, so it makes sense that
Summit Entertainment decided to produce
the ﬁlm before the ﬁnal book in the trilogy
was even ﬁnished. '

The/biggest issue with the ﬁlm is the ac- . '

tress portraying the narrator, Tris: Shailene
Woodley (“The Descendants”). Tris is sup-
posed to be small, pale and surprisingly

strong, and Shailene Woodley’s portrayal of '

her conveys none of this —— in the trailer, she
just looks tired. '

In addition, two of Woodley’s co—stars,
Ansel Elgort (“Carrie”) and Miles Teller (“That
Awkward Moment”), cast as Tris’ brother and
enemy, respectively, have played or will play
her love interests in other novel adaptations
—— which will deﬁnitely weird out viewers.
Ultimately, Woodley’s performance will make
or break this ﬁlm, which opens in theaters

Brazil. Studentshere at Pitt have also been
involved in the program, including recent

Pitt graduate Filipe Silvestre.

Silvestre heard about the program his
sophomore year and was able to partici-
pate in it this past December as part of
his Portuguese class.

“We had to give current everfts and
we interviewed a Brazilian band through
Skype. It was cool because a guy from
Brazil actually called and told us what a
goodjob we did,” he said. V

The program has received national
acclaim, and last year Leininger won the
Brazilian International Press Award in
recognition of her years of service to the

“Brazilian Radio Hour.” Volunteers of all I

sorts run and promote the show, from
students such as Silvestre to Brazilian
music aﬁcionados such as Fred Schroyer.
Schroyer is the editorial director ofthe
Cont_inuous Learning Group, a behavioral
science consultancy, and Djs the show
on the last Friday of every month. He is
a self-proclaimed Brazilian music aﬁcio-
nado, and discovered the richness of its
many genres and styles ﬁve years ago. ‘
Upon_starting to DJ for the show in
2010, Schroyer had collected more than
400 CDs of Brazilian music. His passion
for Brazilian music is evident, and he has
nothing but praise for the genuine joie
de vivre that the music and the Brazilian

people possess.

“The music industry in Brazil is in-
credible. We think of the U.S. when we
think of entertainment, but in Brazil
music and entertainment permeates the
fabric of everything,” Schroyer said.

The show has a‘ different theme each
week and Schroyer noted that “the next
show will be at the end of February after
Carnaval, so we will play Carnaval music
and a good amount ofsamba.” Samba has
its roots in Rio de Janeiro, which is the
home to«the well-known “Carnaval” fes-
tival, which features enormous parades.
The show also does interviews with visit-
ing Brazilian bands and has even inter-

viewed former Brazilian President Jose

Sarney. But the variety of musi_c, from
forro, frevo and samba to the popular
sertanejo (“country pop”) is what really

March 21.

This is a big year for Woodley, who will
not only portray dystopian heroine Tris, but
also cancer-stricken Hazel Grace Lancaster
in the upcoming adaptation ofjohn Green’s
bestseller “The Fault in Our Stars,” in the-
aters June 6. This is a role for which she is
much better suited, and not just because she
is supposed to look tired here. Woodley car-
ries out Hazel’s witty one—liners with ease
in the trailer, and her on—screen chemistry

. with Elgort, who plays Hazel’s love interest

Augustus, is palpable even in the mere two
minutes we see them together in the trailer.
Directed byjosh Boone (“Stuck in Love”),
“The Fault in Our Stars” was ﬁlmed in down-
town Pittsburgh last fall — a reason for Pitt
students to see it if for no other. John Green
himselfwas very involved inthe entire ﬁlming
process, assuring fans every step of the way
of its validity in comparison to the book. If
the ﬁlm is even half as moving as the novel,
though, it will be worth seeing.

ACC BREAKDOWN-

Conference perform

- Ryan Bertonaschi
.S‘tczﬁ” 'Wrz'ter

. This past summer, the NCAA Tournament
Selection Committee met to tweak a rule .
/ _ that would affecfteams from power bas- ‘

ketball conferences.

The new rule allows teams from the
same conference that ‘played each other
only once during the season to square off

starting in the third round of the ‘cham-

pionship. The original rule “did not allow

more than two teams from a league to be ,

[placed] in the same region unlessnine or

more teams were selected [to the overall .

tournament] from one conferenceg’? ac—_,
cording to NCAA.com. v M

In addition, teams from the same league
that meet twice during a regular season will
not play each other until the Sweet 16, and
teams from the same league that square off
three times in a season cannot play until
the Elite 8. ' _

' Some suggested the rule was enacted in
fear of the ACC sending the majority of its
member schools to the NCAA Tournament.’

‘ After all, conference leaders, coaches
and athletic directors shared the same
conﬁdence that the new—look ACC would
become the nation’s premiere college bas-
ketball conference after expanding to in-

‘clude Pitt, Syracuse and N otre Dame, as well

as preparing to induct Louisville in the fall.
“They wanted to have the best basket-
ball conference in the country,” Pitt head

‘coach Jamie. Dixon said when asked about

Pitt’s decision to join the ACC.

But in an interview with The Pitt News,
Ron Wellman, chairman of the NCAA Tour-
nament Selection Committee, strongly de-
nied that the committee made such deci-
sions with the ACC in mind.

“Absolutely not,” said Wellman, who
also serves as athletic director at Wake For-
est. “In fact, when we talked about a rule
change, we did not talk about any confer-
ence speciﬁcally.”

Instead, Wellman said it’s rare for teams
to play twice during a season anymore, sug-
gesting that there’s little harm in matching
up teams for a second time if they have
played each other only once.

“What we have noticed is that many of
the conferences are not playing double
round—robin regular season schedules
anymore,” he said. “There’s an awful lot
of imbalance in the conference schedules
as a result of that, and we [shouldn’t] pre-
vent those teams from playing earlier in
the tournament when they’re only playing
one time during the regular season, and we

a felt that for bracketing purpose, as well as

competitive purposes, it would be best to
allow conference teams to meet earlier in
the tournament, rather than holding off

for so long.”

When a storm of conference moves
shook the collegiate landscape in 2011,
all major conferences, excluding the Big
12, grew by adding more teams than the
number of teams that left.

Aaron Donald is likely a first-round pick in this year’s draft. Bo_bbyMizia |Visual Editor

At the 2014 Senior Bowl lastmonth, _

Donald was selected as the most’ out-
standing player ’ during practices.
CBS Sports projects Donald as a first-
round draft selection, ranking him No.

2 among defensive tackles and No. 22

among all prospects.

Street, a wide receiver, isprojected
as a middle~round pick, and ranked No.
21 among the available receivers in the
2014 draft class. Street became the all-
tirné leader in receptions for Pitt in his
senior season with 202 and earned All-
ACC Third Team honors.

Hailing from Bethlehem, Pa., Street
played in just 10 of Pitt’s 13‘games in

'1 2013 due to various injuries. Over the

course of the season, he compiled 51

catches for 854\yards and seven touch—
downs. ‘ ‘
Savage, Pitt’s starting quarterback

, last year, is the biggest question mark
_of the players headed to the combine,

ranked as the class’ No. 12 quarterback

in a draft thatfs deep at the position. A _

strong showing at the combine could
raise his projected draft round from the
sixth and seventh rounds.

The signal—caller from Springﬁeld,
Pa., played just one season at Pitt in
which he threw for 2,958 yards and 21

touchdowns with nine interceptions. _

His single—season yardage total ranks

Tournament ﬁelds to contain just four to
six ACC teams. 4‘

The midway point in ACC play just
passed, and a handful of critical games lay
ahead in the coming weeks. Here are The
Pitt News’ updated power rankings.

Syracuse (23-0, 10-0 ACC) -

Propelled by National Player of the Year
candidate C.J. Fair’s 19 points, the Orange
extended their longest win streak in school

Breakdown  13

history to 23 games, beating Clemson 57-214
on Saturday. Fair was guarded by Clemson

junior K._]. McDaniels, one of the ACC’s pro-. ‘

liﬁc defenders. .
1 Virginia (19-5, 10-1 ACC) A
The Cavaliers have struggledto ﬁnd
consistent; scoring for the majority of the

' season, but they haven’t had that prob-

lem as-of late'._Sophomore guard Malcolm

Brogdori has emerged as an offensive threat .

for Virginia, averaging more than 16 points
per‘ game in his teamfs last eight ‘contests,

The Cavs are s_ecoﬁdiifti the nation inteam ',
defense,.ho1ding opponents to an average.

of 55.6 points per game. .
- Duke (19‘5, 8-3 ACC) A
Jabari Parker is playing like a future NBA

. All-Star. In just 29 minutes of work Saturday, ‘

the freshman phenom amassed 29 points,

16 rebounds and -3'blocked‘shots against

Boston College. * ‘ »
T-4 North Carolinav('16-7, 6-4 ACC)

The Tar Heels have won ﬁve straight‘ A

games, and they will host Duke Wednesday

after Pitt and Syracuse. It will be hard for '

the Tar Heels‘ to receive a bid to the NCAA
Tournament without a win against Duke, -
whom they play twice — and Pitt or a deep
runin ‘the ACCTournament. ' — '

T-4 Pitt (20—4, 8-3 ACC) . \ *

4 The Panthers have been lucky to pull
out their past two games —+ both overtime

wins —.against two bottom-halfteams in ,
, the ACC. Things’won’t get easier for Pitt,

either, since‘ leading scorer Lamar Patter-
son has missed two of last week’s practices

because of an undisclosed injury to his right V

hand. Patterson had just one ﬁeld goal in
Pitt’s double-overtime win against last—place

Virginia Tech on'Saturday. Patterson’s status

for Wednesday is unknown. ,
Clemson (15-7, 6-4 ACC) .
The Tigers have a chance to pick up a

4 signature win when they play Virginia on
Saturday. Clemson is among ESPN Brack— ~
etologist Joe Lunardi’s ﬁrst four out of the

NCAA Tournament.
Maryland (14-10, 6-5 ACC)
The Terrapins have a tough home

’ stretch. They still have to play Duke and .

Syracuse once each, and Virginia twice.
_ _ Florida State (14-9, 5-6 ACC)
_ To go with ﬁve losses in the Seminoles’

- last seven games, the team sustained a po-
p tential blow to its ﬁxture when commit Cin-
