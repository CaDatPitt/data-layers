says Mecl students
to pay health fee

 

Cesca Antonelli
News Editor

The Board of Trustees
Student Affairs committee
voted Thursday to rescind its
earlier recommendation that
medical students be exempted
from the student health fee and
to form a committee to study
the possible ways to resolve the
question in the future.

The committee had voted to
exempt medical students from
the fee at its April 26 meeting
because these students are
required to pay $800 per year
for insurance from UHN to
attend medical school, as well
as paying $115 per year to Pitt
for the student health fee. The
two required charges cover the
same services.

The committee decided to
recommend to the Executive
Committee at its July 19 meet-
ing that a task force consisting
of University administration
with Medical School represen-
tation be formed to give the
question of double fees a harder
look. The deadline for the task
force’s report has been set for
November 30.

“We don’t have the infor-
mation, we couldn’t come to the
best decision now,” Trustee
Suzarme Broadhurst said.

The Medical School’s con-
tract with UHN has one year
before renewal. Broadhurst said
that the delay would give the
committee that year to study the
issue and to make a decision
that would benefit students in
the future.

At the meeting, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg said that the

choice originally seemed sim-

ple, that the University should
avoid duplicative fees, but that,
after further review, the issue
was not so straight forward.

Nordenberg said that two
issues remained unresolved.
First, students at the Medical
School have a higher level of

use than those in other schools. _

Twenty—eight percent of med-
ical students use student health
services, compared to only 21
percent of students from other
schools, according to Trustee
Jonathan Harris.

The second issue was the
question of what would happen

to the system if a sizeable group U

withdrew. Many committee
members voiced concerns about

.a possible fee increase if med-

ical students were exempted.

Dennis Donham, assistant
vice chancellor for student
affairs, said that many Pitt stu-
dents are already having tough
times making ends meet ﬁnan-
cially, and that an increase in
the fee could make it difficult
for some students to continue.

“A lot of students drop out
of Pitt over a few hundred dol-
lars,” Donham said. “There are
a lot of students here that have
very hard times. I don’t think
we know all the consequences
[of exempting the Med stu-
dents].”

George K. Michalopoulos,
interim dean of the medical
school, said that paying for
UHN insurance and paying the
$115 fee makes medical stu-
dents “ﬁnancially tremendously
overburden .”

Michalopoulos said that
there were 20,000 student
health users and less than 2,000
medical students, so these stu-
dents make up only a small per-
cent of the total number of
users. He" said that having fewer
users would decrease the total
cost of the program, meaning
there ‘would be a need for fewer
supplies . and personnel.

The Masonic Temple on Fifth Avenue is huge. Pitt paid $8.5 million for it. So why is it empty?

Temple remains unused

  Three years and $8.5 million later; Pitt still

undecided about how to use the extra space

Lisa McClendon
Senior Staﬁ Writer

The future of the Masonic Temple has been
unclear since Pitt purchased it in December of 1993
for $8.5 million from the Masons. Three years later,
it seems to many University oﬂicials that no one
knows when that confusion is going to end

The Temple was initially to be used as an
adjunct to Pitt’s Hillman Library, but now in 1996,’
that idea, it seems, has all but been thrown out the
window. Since July of 1994, the second ﬂoor mez-
zanine has been the only space used to house the
Hillman Library archives.

Robert Pack, the vice provost for academic
planning and resources management, is reviewing
the University’s needs in regards to buildings and
space available as well as how to utilize this space.

The Provost’s Ofﬁce had no response to the
inquiries regarding the Temple and the report, which
will serve as a way to establish the University’s
needs.

The temple, located at 4227 Fifth Avenue,
across from the Cathedral of Learning, had been
home to the Masons since 1915. After the purchase,

the Masons were given a lease, which recently
ended in April of 1996, to use the building until they
found a new home. They now reside at the Greater
Pittsburgh Masonic Center in Ross Township.

Although priority for use of the building was
given to the Masons, Pitt employee, student, and
non-proﬁt groups were also able to reserve rooms as
well as auditorium space in the building since its
purchase. The building was closed to the public in
April of 1996. U

Some of the presentations held at the temple
were performances by the Kuntu Repertory Theatre,
as well as an appearance by the U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno, who spoke during Pitt’s
American Experience Distinguished lecture series
on October 31, 1993.

The Masons have had the past three years to
clear out their furniture and stage backdrops, as well
as other property.

“If you walk through the building now it’s pret-
ty clean. It’s in very good condition,” said Chris
Weinstein, building manager for the Office of
Facilities Management “It doesn’t look like anybody
just picked up and le

Interim clean named to Katz school

Sally Stewart
For The Pitt News

Pitt has postponed making a
ﬁnal decision-on who is to ﬁll the
dean position at the business
school, though the search had
been narrowed to three candidates
in April. Instead, a long-time, asso-
ciate dean has been named interim
dean of the school.

 

Andrew R. Blair, who has
been the associate dean of the
Joseph M. Katz Graduate School
of Business since 1971, was
appointed to the position of inter-
im dean of the school by Provost

. James V. Maher while the search

for a permanent dean continues.
Blair is scheduled to take the
post on July 29, the ﬁrst day of the
fall semester at the Katz school.
The position was left vacant in

June when H]; Zoffer retired as
dean of the school after a 28-year
tenure. The search for a perma-
nent replacement began in
September after Zoffer armounced
his plans to retire last summer.
According to Blair, it is not
uncommon for a major dean
search like this one to take longer
than a year, and he is uncertain
how long he will be acting as
interim dean. Blair said no matter

what the length of his term may
be, he plans to be active in the
affairs of the school and wants to
keep things running as smoothly‘
as possible.

“I will want to make sure that
the interim period will not disrupt
the momentum of the school,”
Blair said. “I don’t want to be sim-
ply a caretaker. It wouldn’t be
good for a school of this quality,

Future hearing to highlight pros
and cons to riverboat gambling

Anne Estonilo
For The Pitt News

For those hoping
Riverboat gambling will be
established in the near future,
the wait may be awhile.

House Bill number 2308,
introduced by George Kenney,
providing for the establish-
ment of the Riverboat Gaming
Commission in Pennsylvania,
was referred to the House

Judiciary Committee on

January 24, 1996. As it stands
today, the bill remains in their
hands with another hearing
scheduled in Erie on
September 12.

To date, three hearings
have been held -in different
parts of Pennsylvania. The
May 29 hearing was held at
the William Pitt Union and

. focused on the effects of river-

boat gambling on the horse
racing industry. Previous hear-
ings dealt with the history of
gambling and tourism. The
September hearing will dis-
cuss the negative effects of

gambling.
Both No Dice and
Pennsylvanians Against

Gambling Expansion (PAGE),
two anti-gaming groups, will
testify at the upcoming hear-
ing _on Penn State’s Barron
Campus. Charlotte Sonne,

President of the Pittsburgh-
based grass-roots organization
No Dice, said that they plan to
bring in expert testimony from
states who presently have
legalized gambling.

Legalized gambling is one
of the hottest issues in the

' news. The Wall Street Journal

announced yesterday that
among other states looking
into legalized gambling,
Connecticut was investigating
the issue. While the prospect
of legalized gambling helping
the economy of Pennsylvania
is promising to many people,
the issue has induced mixed
feelings from many
Pittsburghers.

“Gambling itself doesn’t
bother me,” said Hillorie
Monsour, a Pitt undergraduate.
“But the idea of crime, rape

V and spousal abuse going up. I

know it’s not a good idea.”

A report of Attorney
General J. Joseph Curran, Jr.
on the impact of casino gam-
ing on crime cites eight states
that have experienced an
increase on crime resulting
from casino gambling. Abuse
ranging from assaults to mur-
der show an increase of at
least 64 percent and go up to
as high as 311 percent for rob-
bery in Gulfport, Mississippi,

gambling.
The other side of the issue

presents the economic benefit -

of casino gaming in
Pennsylvania. According to
the Pennsylvania Association
of Convention and Visitors
Bureaus (PACVB) newsletter,
the spring 1996 issue projects
that casino entertainment and
related _businesses in
Pennsylvania are expected to
generate approximately $3.4
billion in casino winnings,
food and beverage and retail
revenue annually by the fifth
year of operation.

Job creation would allow
for $650 million to be generat-
ed by the fifth year of opera-
tion for related businesses and
casino entertainment. Further,
approximately $580 million in
additional tax revenue for the
state and $100 million annual-
ly for local governments is
expected to be generated,
according to PACVB.

“After visiting cities like
Las Vegas and Wendover
[Nev.], the gambling service
provides jobs and really is no
worse than the bar Scene,” said
Michelle McCoy, a North
Hills resident. “It just needs to
be organized responsibly.”

A recent poll conducted
by Peter Hart, a consultant
from NBC and The Wall Street
Journal, and Vincent Breglio,
a former Bush—Quayle poll-
ster, found that 66 percent of
adults in Allegheny County
are in favor of riverboat gam-
bling. After being read five
arguments in favor of river-
boat gambling and eight
against it, 63 percent of voters
statewide still supported it.

°f"0m Page 1 “There is a level of funding

Michalopoulos said that raising tial,” Haley said.

the fee was not the only way to
redistribute costs.

“[The program is]
scaleable, depending on the size
of the population whose needs it
meets,” Michalopoulos said.

-Diane Moore, a Medical
School representative, said that
at other universities that charge

both fees, students "get a mone-

tary break on one fee, which is
not the case at Pitt. .

Leon Haley, vice chancellor
for student and public affairs,
said that the reasons Pitt med-
ical students have to pay both
fees are similar to the reasons
for the double charge at other
schools-—the need for equity
and to maintain a coherent body
of students paying the universi-
ty fee.

Haley said that Pitt’s stu-
dent health fee is below the
average fee at other universities.
According to Haley, the median
fee at other schools is $140 per

term, compared to Pitt’s $115 A

per year.

“If we were to submit every
fee to the students for a vote, I
suspect we’d have very few
fees,” Haley said.

The only reason the
University has ever made an
exemption of its fees was a geo-
graphic one. Students participat-
ing in internships in Washington
or South America or prison
inmates doing college study
courses have been exempted
from the fee in the past because

they were not geographically

able to use the services.

or for the University.”

Balir was nominated for the
position of dean, but he withdrew
his name from consideration.

“I felt the school would bene-
ﬁt from a ﬁesh, outside position,”
Blair explained. He said that his
close association with the previ-
ous administration prevented him
from providing this perspective to
the position.

In addition to being associate
dean of the Katz School for the
past 25 years, Blair has also held a
joint appointment in the
Economics department in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences since

1975. The nominating commit-
tee reviewing the candidates for
ZolTer’s replacement has conclud-
ed its search and submitted a list
of three ﬁnalists to the provost for
consideration on April 19, accord-
ing. to Edward Sell, the search
committee chairman.

The three ﬁnalist candidates
for the position are:

due to the elongated windows, which give it the
impression of only having four ﬂoors. The temple
has 10 ﬂoors including four main ﬂoors, between
each main ﬂoor are partial ﬂoors called mezzanines.
It houses a banquet hall, a 1,000—seat auditorium,
and several small meeting rooms, as well as a base-

ment which has a fully-equipped kitchen.

Unfoittmately, Pitt will not be able to utilize all
this space at once, because of ﬁne code restiictions
which limit the number of people who can be in the
entire building at any one time to 540 persons.

It has been a misconception that Pitt bought the
-Syria Mosque, another building, only to destroy it.
In fact, UPMC bought and demolished that building.
It seems to many University officials that in the
wake of the Mosque misunderstanding comes
another issue; what to do with the temple.

Arthur Erhe
furthers high
school teachers’
education

Kris Kissel
For The Pitt News

Of the utmost importance
to good high school educations
for our youth in this country is
that we have good high school
teachers, according to G. Alec
Stewart, dean of the Honors
College. That is why he has
invited Arthur Erbe, a Pitt
English Literature professor,
to instruct high school teach-
ers on how to do their jobs
better.

Erbe will have spent last
week and this one running
seminars for high school
Advanced Placement English
teachers in the Honors
College. The seminars, each
running for one week, are
designed to prepare high
school teachers to run an AP
course in their home schools.
The first week is dedicated to
teachers who are about to start
teaching AP courses, and the
second week is made for
teachers who have already had
experience teaching such
classes, but who want to
improve their teaching skills.

AP English classes are
meant to prepare advanced
students for the AP English
examination, administered by
the College Board, the same
board which prepares the infa-
mous SAT exams, and to pro-
vide for students who pass
with college credit in English.

Erbe shows these teachers
how to present the material to
the students. The participants
are asked to read, before com-
ing to the seminar, several
pieces of literature for discus-
sion, including Shakespeare’s

“Othello” and Kafka’s “The

Metamorphosis.”

The seminars are focused
on teaching, reading, and dis-
cussing literature, as well as
some of the background issues
which come up, such as deal-
ing with students who some-
times have very extreme per-

sonalities. High school teach— .
ers from allover the nation

come to meet for four hours
everyday and to discuss their
readings.

“We’re modelinglwhat
they could go back and do in
their own classrooms,” said
Erbe. “They’re experiencing
what it’s like to be a student at
Pitt, so that they can go back
and tell their students what it’s
like at the University.”

Erbe is very optimistic
about this program. He has run
similar programs for the past
12 years at Carnegie Mellon
University, though this is the
first one that he has run out of
Pitt. \

“It is such an exciting
experience to work with high
school teachers who are will-
ing to take time out of their

' summer to learn to teach their

students better,” Erbe said. “I
think that’s just remarkable.” .

Erbe is very highly
thought of by some in the aca-
demic community. “I represent
the College Board,” said Mary
Alice Gilligan, the associate
director of Advanced
Placement for the rnid—Atlantic
region. “It is important that we
have qualified people like
Arthur to give guidance to
teachers. They are doing this
for no compensation —
they’re not being paid to be
here — because they want to
be better for their students.
The ultimate beneficiaries are
the students, and that’s why
this is so important.”

About the importance of
having AP classes and exams,
Gilligan said, “It levels the
playing field and provides an
equal opportunity for students
to apply and be accepted into
the colleges and universities of
their choice.”

Stewart also talks about

the high school students when
he discusses, in never—ending
prose, the importance of what
Erbe is doing. “I think it is
important for two reasons.
First is the availability of
Arthur Erbe to run the work-
shop, because ‘of his vast expe-
rience with doing this kind. of
thing for 12 years. And sec-
ond, this is consistent with the
Honors College interest in pro-
moting high attainment inde-
pendent of level, and we are
delighted to host this. Nothing
is more important to providing
high academic attainment in
America than having good

' high school teachers.”

Marry whomever you like

You find someone with whom to spend your life.
You want to provide for him or her through the benefits
married couples receive. You and your spouse distribute
your income between yourselves, take care of eachother,
and live together. Shouldn’t your benefits be shared as
well?

A If you are a male/female partnership this is not an
issue. In fact, you do not even have to be married, as
most states consider long—term couples to be common
law marriages. However, if you are one of the many
same-sex partnerships in this country, you might as well
forget it. ,

The United States House of Representatives voted
not to federally recognize same sex marriages even if
states were to make them legal. The only Western
Pennsylvania Representative to take a stand against this
bill was Congressman Bill Coyne who represents
Oakland. Our kudos to Congressman Coyne.

It is inherently against the founding principles of
this nation to deny‘ same sex couples the recognition
given to opposite-sex couples. As all people are consid-
ered equal under the law, sexual preference should not be
a determinant of the protections one will receive under
that law. This is as bigoted as not recognizing marriages
due to the racial or religious background of the couple.

Another disturbing factor in this debate was the
heavy quoting of the Bible by each side. As the govern-
ment of this country is based upon a separation of church
and state, biblical argumentshave no place in the mecha-
nisms of government. If we are to base our government
on a constitution, we must adhere to that constitution.

If we are to be a free society, we must protect the
freedom of each member of this society regardless of .
whether or not we personally agree with what that person
chooses to do with his or her freedom. The only limita-
tions on this freedom is that it not infringe upon the free-
dom of another.

President Clinton needs to remember that if this
bill appears on his desk. ‘

Parents need good planning, not reports

Amy L. Tollner

On May 22, The Pitt News
reported that Pitt researchers
studying day care released a
report that “indicated that a
child’s emotional attachment to
her mother does not change if
the child is raised in a day
care.” There are two variables
that I wish to address: What
degree of attachment to a moth-
er is essential for raising a
healthy child? What does it
mean to “raise” a child?

I am a mother of a 20
month old child and agree that
day care is not necessarily
damaging to the relationship
that I have with my daughter.
This is not to say that day care
is universally non—damaging.
Yes, my daughter attends a day

. care facility, but I do not abuse

this helpful institution. I do not
worry about being back in
school because I plan a sched-
ule that suits my daughter’s
needs as well as those for the
completion of my degree.
Planning is essential in parent-
ing. One does not always plan
to have a child, but once one
does, one can make plans as to
how to raise her or him.

The report says that a
“child’s emotional attachment
to her mother does not
change.” What if a child has a
poor attachment to its mother?
Day care'would not change
this. Would being raised at
home change the emotional

attachment? Would not the.

chances of improving an emo-
tional attachment between child
and mother increase, if the
mother raised her own child?
The answers depend upon

the child and the mother. What

is known is that if a child has a
poor or strong attachment to
his/her mother, that will not
change if the child goes to day
care. In one family, emotional
ties may be weak and in anoth-
er, they may be healthy. Day
care will not change the type of
emotional ties created and nur-

tured inside the family. For
example, I feel that my daugh-
ter and I are well attached to
each other. This is because I
plan to spend my time raising
her when I am with her. I
choose to have a schedule that
allows me enough time to be a
good mother according to my
standards. My personal goals
are to get an A+ in motherhood

and then an A as a student. .

Having my daughter in day
care does not damage our
attachment, because it is part of
my plan for us.

Each family is unique.
How could one determine the
universal degree of attachment
(between mother and child)
that would be essential for rais-
ing healthy children? There is
no litmus test to measure each
family’s success. Some moth-
ers will choose to read what
experts advise, other will raise
their kids based on their own
knowledge. I want to have a
wonderful attachment with my
daughter and I have certain
ideas as to how I will make that
happen. Society has setup a
social system that removes
children from homes that is ter-
ribly invasive.

But tax payers have also
provided for wonderful pro-
grams, in which my daughter
and I are participants, that have
allowed me to afford school,
day care, medical expenses,
and more. I have been able to
create a wonderful, stable, and
trustworthy bond with my

child. The AFDC and the

Education and Training
Program have promoted a
healthy family life for me and
Gloria. These programs are
helpful, but the motivation and
desire to plan a decent family is
also important. Society cannot
set a standard for mothers that
they achieve speciﬁc emotional
attachments with their chil-
dren',.

“Raising” a child means
many things. It means to look
out for their physical and men-
tal health. To educate, feed,

comfort, clothe, and instill val-
ues are all parts of raising a
child. What then does “raised
in day care” imply? Perhaps
raised with day care would bet-
ter articulate how 1, mother of
my child, am raising my
daughter. “In day care” implies
that all the raising of the child
occurs between the hours of 9
a.m. and 2 pm. Tuesday
through Thursday. Day care is
part of my daughter’s life expe-
rience and not the majority.
Experiencing and learning the
many skills, ideas, and bad
habits that a child encounters in

day care contribute to the over- '

all “upbringing” of a child.
Children should be raised by a
family, and day care can be a
part of their life.

In summary, the _ article
indicates that day care does not
change the emotional attach-
ment between mother and
child. The study does not set a
standard for a specific degree
of attachment that a mother
should achieve with her child
in order to raise a healthy child.
The report of the day care study
does not indicate specifically
what it means to raise a child
“in day care.” How much day
care is too much? When does
raising a child by its family
turn into raising a child by its
day care?

Raising a child to become a -

responsible adult is challenging
and important for future gener-
ations. Mothers have tradition-
ally raised children and the
issue of using day care should
be handled with great care as
with all aspectsof a child’s
care. A lot of patience, time,
creativity, and love were
invested in the relationship that
I have with my daughter. If I
thought day care was damaging
my relationship with Gloria, I
would respond to my feelings
and not refer to this “Study
finds infant day care not dam-
aging.”

ogy major.

-magine yourself at a bar,
say, The Attic, for a fun-
illed night of carousing,
when, all of a sudden, you see
someone that has armoyed you
in the past.
_ With a few beers and a fat
duece in you, your judgment
may not be crystal clear so
you charge that person deliv-
ering an elbow, breaking the
person’s nose and knocking
him senseless.

Naturally when the
bouncers see this they’re
gonna beat you outta there,
and, if you’re lucky, the ﬁve-o
won’t get involved.

_ This would happen to any
normal citizen, unless your
name happens to be Albert
“Don’t Call Me Joey,
Faitknocker” Belle.

Albert Belle makes me
sick. ’

Albert Belle belongs in
jail 4 .

Albert Belle might single-
handedly destroy baseball.

Possibly his most glorious
moment, besides fanning three
times in last week’s all-star

' game and performing poorly
in last year’s World Series,
came when he violently and
deliberately decked Fernando
‘Vina of the Milwaukee
Brewers for the second time in
the same game while running
between first and second base

(probably all the farther

B*elle’s ever gotten with a
female given his nasty dispo-

sition). .

Earlier in that game, Belle
decked Vina during a similar
play. Why? Because the poor
little baby, who’s making mil-
lions to be a complete asshole,
got his little shoulder hit with

' a curveball. Boo-hoo. I guess
that merits breaking the sec-
ond basemen’s nose.

That act was the single
most disgusting play baseball
has seen in years. But that’s
only scratching Bel1e’s sur-
face.

It’s time to scrtach that
surface — maybe we can irri-
tate his skin a little. ’

Oval leaves his office
Athletic director resigns after stormy five years

Mike Kovak
Sports Editor

Oval Jaynes entered the world of Pitt
athletics when he accepted the athletic
director’s position on August 31, 1991.
At the time, Pitt’s future was uncertain,
but J aynes goals appeared clear.

Now on July 15, 1996, Jaynes
resigned from the position with Pitt
sports facing more uncertainty than ever
before.

At the current moment, the waters
are somewhat muddied concerning
Jaynes resignation. Any Pitt person with
common sense can think of three obvious

reasons: fund—raising woes, which have
stalled the beginnings of the convocation
center, the slumping football and basket-
ball teams, and a shaky handling of the
Paul Evans situation in 1994.

In a prepared statement, Jaynes said,
“I think we moved the program ahead,
but I also believe that this period of
change in leadership for the University is
the appropriate time for me to step
aside.”

It should be noted that Jaynes was
one of a dozen key administrators that
trustees chairman J. Wray Connolly told
to turn in their resignations to offer new
chancellor Mark Nordenberg a free hand
in creating a new administrative team.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service, in typi-
cal Pitt PR fashion, said, “In no way is
this to be related with the resignation
suggestion. As far as we know, this was
totally Jaynes’ decision.”

Nordenburg heaped praises on
Jaynes in the same prepared statement,
“Among the many positive qualities that
Oval Jaynes brought to the University
were integrity and a strong commitment
to our student—athletes. As we begin the
process of identifying a worthy successor
and working toward establishing an even
more successful sports program, we
know that we will be building upon the
strong foundation that he helped to cre-
ate.”

_ Still, Nordenberg accepted the resig-
nation. It is not known how many others
will follow.

The convocation center was consid-
ered to be an essential ingredient in the
rebuilding of Pitt basketball. The inabili-
ty to raise funds for the $52 million pro-
ject that would not only offer Pitt basket-
ball a new home, but also house facilities
for all students to use, grew like a fester-
ing boil on Pitt’s significant financial dif-
ficulties. The convocation center possi-

bly could help Pitt land top—notch ath-
letes, instead of letting stars like Vassil
Evtimov and Jamaal Magliore slip away
to other universities. _

Over the past year, the University
has initiated a facelift of Pitt Stadium.
With completely new weight training
equipment, locker rooms and a state—of—
the-art rehabilitation facility, the initial
steps in rebuilding Pitt’s football pro-
gram, which only managed 18 wins in
Jaynes’ tenure, appeared successful.

Fund-raising woes have plagued the
plans for the‘ convocation center. Without
the necessary fund—raising, which comes
from groups like Pitt alumni, the troubles
with getting the project off the ground
illustrate problems that have not only
scourged Jaynes, but also the man he
replaced, Ed Bozik. In basic terms, fund-
raising translates to winning teams. .

Although the facelift to Pitt Stadium
is under way, J aynes has received a. lot of
heat because the football program lost $3
million to $4 million annually under his
regime. Pitt football has traditionally
been the primary revenue generator and
it has affected the rest of the athletic
department as well, which reported a loss
of $5 million this year and $6 million last
year. A .
A few reasons for the deficit deal
directly with the students and fans of
Pitt. When a stadium that seats in excess
of 56,000 can barely draw 30,000 a
game, losses are inevitable. '

J aynes upset fans of Pitt basketball in
1994 with his handling of the firing of
Paul Evans. Throughout that season,
J aynes never let his intentions be known,
finally offering Evans a contract that was
a joke.

Evans, understandably so, refused to
recruit for Pitt, and the basketball pro-
gram appeared in shambles. That’s when

Olympic dream, can be

For some athletes, this
recipe leaves a bitter taste
in the mo-uth. Never quite
turning into sweet, golden
perfection.

For others, this is the
bread and meat on which
they live.

As the Olympic opening
ceremonies commence on
Friday, two University of
Pittsburgh athletes will be
tasting this dish for the first
time.

Marisa Pedulla, a grad-
uate student in the depart-
ment of Biological sci-

ences, is attempting to be
the first American Judoka
to win gold in a sport
which embodies grace,
beauty, and ferocity.
Currently ranked number
one in the United States in
judo in the women’s 52kg

division, Pedulla is the only‘

woman to have won four
consecutive collegiate
national championships in
oneweight division.

In addition to all her
judo accomplishments,
Pedulla also appeared on
tv’s “American Gladiators.”

She is going into
Atlanta with an incredible
athletic record, including
29 first place finishes and
two gold medals in the U.S.
Olympic festival in 1989
and 1993.

Competing in the
Olympics has been a dream
of Pedulla’s since she was
five years old, and that
dream will come into reali-
ty on July 25 as she steps
onto the mat to compete

with some of the best
female judo experts in the
world. ’

Pedulla isn’t worried
though. “I just need to play
the kind of judo I know I
can play.”

Ayne Allen, who gradu-
ated this year with a degree
in computer science, is also
making the long trek to the
deep south to participate in
this year’s summer
Olympics. She "will be com-
peting for St. Kitts, West
Indies in the 400-meter

‘dash and the 4x400 relay.

The events Allen will
be competing in should be
comfortable for her. She
won the 400 in last year’s
Doug Raymond Invitational
and had Pitt’s best time last

Championships with a

What Ned loves about America's game

     

 

Ned Schano
Staﬁ Writer

(Editor’s Note: The following is a first-half rundown of the
1996 Major League Baseball Season, at least how Ned
sees things.)

Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of .400

To me, baseball is the epitome of life. It represents
America, purity, and summer, three things not always
mentioned in the same breath. I feel that in this month of
Independence Day and the XXV Olympic Games, there is
nothing better nor more patriotic than watching a game of
baseball during a lazy July evening. A

I get discouraged when people say that baseball is too
slow or too boring to hold their interest. For these detrac-
tors and fans like myself, I would like to offer a few rea-
sons to be excited about the greatest sport on Earth.

-Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, Rey Ordonez and Alex
Gonzalez. ' .
These phenoms are the future of shortstops.’All four
are under 22 years of age and playing the toughest posi-
tion in baseball. They will take baseball into the 21st cen-

tury. -

-Mark McGwire

The Oakland Athletics slugger is on pace to break the
all-time record for homeruns per at-bats (nearly a 1:7
ratio). Yes, that would even beat the immortal Babe Ruth.

61 home runs and he missed most of April.

-Ken Griffey, Jr.

Their is no more exciting player both offensively and
defensively than Junior. Plus, his enthusiasm and market-
ing ability are major assets to MLB.

-The Cleveland Indians '

Long the joke of the American League East, their rise
to prominence has been meteoric since joining the AL
Central. Their lineup is absolutely stacked from top to
bottom including Carlos Baerga, Manny Ramirez, and fan
favorite Albert Joseph Belle. Plus if you haven’t visited
J acobsField, you’re in for a day of baseball heaven.

-The Montreal Expos

The team with few superstars and without the ridicu-
lous contracts in other sports currently has the second best
record in the National League. They are doing all this with
the smallest payroll in the game. Les Expos should be a
model for other small market teams. ’ '

0 The Pittsburgh Pirates

Speaking of small market teams, this brings me to our
very own Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite the Buccos terrible
record, there is reason for enthusiasm. Jason Kendall
made the National League All-Star team as a rookie, hit-
ting near .300 while playing solid defense behind the
plate. He became only the seventh rookie catcher to play
in the midsummer’s classic. '

On the other side of the number scale is the ageless
wonder Danny Darwin, who is giving inspiration to the
over-40 crowd, providing valuable starting pitching help
and giving basebal1’s best manager, Jim Leyland, a fewer
sleepless nights.

Plus, new owner Kevin McClatchy, while seven years
Darwin’s younger, is doing all he can to support the team,
both financially and with his positive attitude. His pres-
ence behind home plate at nearly every home game is an
important show of support. McClatchy’s plans for a new
baseball-only stadium ensure that baseball will remain in
Pittsburgh at least until well into the next century.

Hopefully this will encourage people to go to more
baseball games. And when you visit Three Rivers
Stadium, while you may not see a .400 hitter, you can
experience a slice of life and hopefully, just a little happi-
ness.

Willard
gets two
commitments

After two gigantic blunders

late in last season’s college basket--

ball recruiting wars, Pitt Head
Coach Ralph Willard got an early
jump on things by receiving verbal
commitments from two high
schoolers —-- 6—foot-9 Chris
Seabrooks of Macon, Ga., and 6-
foot-5 guard Ricky Greer of
Cheshire (Conn.) Academy Prep.

Verbal commitments are not
binding in the NCAA. The players
aren’t committed until they sign
national letters of intent. No player
can sign before November.

Seabrooks is considered one of
the top high schoolers in Georgia.
Last season at Northeast High
School, he averaged 15 points, 12
rebounds and two blocks per
game. He chose Pitt over
Syracuse, Connecticut, Georgia
Tech, Georgia, Miami and Auburn.

Greer, last year’s Manhattan
Player of the Year at George
Washington High School, enrolled
in Cheshire to repeat his junior
year. Last year, he averaged 26
points and eight rebounds per
game.

Archie Miller, brother of Pitt-
great Sean, will probably not
attend Pitt next year, opting to fol-
low his brother to North Carolina
State. ‘ '

Miller basically told reporters '

that he loves the way NC State is
restructuring it’s program, with
plans that include a new basketball
arena. E

' One Pitt star you won’t be seeing in

Due to some Guyanese bureaucrat with a
.Cranial—Rectal inversion, (take your time
with that one, we’ll wait for you to catch
up) Najuma was not picked to represent

her native Guyana in the Olympics.

As one of the greatest athletes in Pitt

_‘history and possibly the greatest athlete
Guyana has ever seen, "it is extremely dis-

appointing not to be able to watch her take
her place in Olympic history next to other
Pitt greats and gold medalists Roger
Kingdom and John Woodruff. Kingdom
won twice (1984 and 1988) in the high
hurdles, and Woodruff won the gold medal
in the 800 meters in 1936.

Najuma had been sending her results to
a liason in Guyana and was told she was a
‘lock to join the team. That is until Najuma
received the phone call from her family
that she was somehow left off the team.
They got the bad news from the local

newspaper. Lorrie Ann-Adams, also from

Guyana and a member of the Arizona track

A team, was excluded from the team also.

“The man in charge is definitely taking
care of his friends,” said Steve Lewis, a
native Guyanan and Najuma’s coach here
at the University. “I guess Najuma and
Lorrie live in the wrong part of town.”

Najuma was expected to finish in the
top ten in the high jump, the event in
which she holds the school record of six
feet. In the heptathalon, Najuma’s best
event, it is very possible she would have
been able to take home a medal.

Fletcher has some Olympic experience

under her belt already. At 18, she compet- _

ed in the 1992 Barcelona Games. And she
is already thinking ahead to the 2000
games. _

“If I were an athlete, I wouldn’t want
to mess with Najuma at age 26,” Lewis
said. “That’s the age when they’re winning
medals. She’ll be scary.”

As for now, Fletcher recently entered
Katz graduate school for business and will
be an assistant for Coach Lewis on next
year’s track team.

And who knows, by then Najuma
might be bringing home the gold for a
team that would really appreciate her
efforts. The Star Spangled Banner needs to
be played a few more times in the games,
don’t you think?

American punk innovators Pere Ubu come toPittsburgl1

lit" is-5*"-in-=
 as ss
_ OVER TOKYO

#3, al .. ~
.,,.,%, aw erasr Soprpw

I recently borrowed a book entitled Punk Rock D'a_ry
1970-79 from the Carnegie Library. Basically, I was curious to

‘ ﬁnd out what the author, George Gimarc, thought of the

American side of the punk equation. It turns out that the book’s
focus was almost entirely on Great Britain, with only a few
mentions of U.S. groups like the Rarnones, the Stooges, and the
MC5. '

What impressed me about the book, though, was that out
of the ﬁve American groups covered, Pere Ubu were not only
included, but given the same amount of credence of the
Ramones. Pere Ubu often get overlooked in the main stream
music media largely due to their genre-bending sound. None
the less, the group, hailing from Cleveland, Ohio, impressed
and inspired countless fans, many of whom went on to form
bands themselves.

Ubu came together in 1975 after Rocket from the Tombs
disbanded. RFT had a decisive garage rock sound, and their
sets consisted of classics from the Velvet Underground, Troggs,
and Stooges, as well as some witty original compositions. Gene
O’Connor (drums) changed his name to Cheetah Chrome and
went on to ﬁnd fame in the Dead Boys, while David Thomas
(vocals) and Peter Lauglmer (guitar) took and old RFI‘ original
“30 Seconds Over Tokyo” and formed Pere Ubu.

Thomas came up with the name of the group from reading
the French absurdist playwright Alfred Jarry’s “Uboi Roi”
plays. Like J arry, he had a penchant for nonsense and wry wit.
Musically, the band was comprised of guitar, bass, drums, and
an AMT synthesizer, the latter of which became the key sigr1a—
ture ingredient to sound. The albums and singles that followed,
“Final Solution,” “Street Waves,” “Modem Dance,” “Dub
Housing,” etc, became instant cult classics. Critics who were
hip to new underground music compared them with Frank
Zappa, Captain Beefheart, and the Red Krayola. Ubu actually
toured with Mayo Thompson and the Red Krayola and Nico

film view

Courage Under Fire

 

(of VU fame) to support their Dub Housing tour!

What makes Ubu so cool is the way in their eccentricity is
balanced with great pop sensibility. On one hand, their music is
ﬁlled with bizarre lyric imagery and strange layers of synthesiz-
ers and raspy guitars. On the other hand, Pere Ubu is pure pop
genius. Their songs are hurnmable and may just insight a spell
of frantic" toe tapping. Despite the years and the odds, the group
is still recording music and playing shows. Even though the
odds have been against them (R.E.M. and the Pixies paid for
them to ﬂy to NY for a performance on “Late Night” a few
years ago) and members have come and gone,‘ Ubu seems
stronger than ever. They released an album on Tim Kerr
Records entitled, Raygun Suitcase last summer and have a 7”
box set of their early singles on Hearpen. Best yet, Pittsburgh
will be blessed with a perfonnance this Thursday, July 18, at
Luciano’s Café.

Opening the show is Burning Bus, whose music I have yet
to hear, sorry. However, I do know the Speaking Canaries. This
show marks the return of PitIsburgh’s super—rock guitar stran-
gling combo. [ed by Daman Ché, the group’s line up consists
of Scott (210) on bass, Eric (Storm and Stress Group) on 2nd
guitar, and Dale (Empire Builder) on drums. Look for some
singles/Ep’s from the group on Scat Records in the near future.

This show should not be missed! Once again, Pere Ubu at

Luciano is Cafe’ this Thursday, July 18th at 8PM. Its all ages.

releasing Courage Under Fire during
the summer of huge action block-
busters. While most people go to the
cinema wanting only to sit in their
comfy chair and to be entertained as

photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox

fact, quite the opposite is true. In a
season of lackluster movies, this one
makes up for many of the disappoint-

ments (see Twister, Mission."

Impossible, Eraser, etc.).

Denzel Washington stars as Lt.
Colonel Nat Serling, a tank comman-
der who saw his best friend die as a
result of friendly fire in Desert Storm
— a result of Serling’s own command.

In hopes of covering up a messy situa- -

tion, Serling is transferred to a desk
job in the office of Awards and
Decorations at the Pentagon.

Serling is assigned the task of
reviewing the candidacy for the Medal
of Honor for Capt. Karen Walden
(played by Meg Ryan), who died in a
heroic Medevac rescue. It ‘would be

the first Medal of Honor given to a _

woman for combat duty and it is an
award that everyone at the White
House and the Pentagon wants to rub-
ber-stamp as quickly as possible. They
want a hero.

However, during his investigation,
Serling stumbles on to some clues that
Wa1den’s actions may not have been
as heroic as they first seemed. It soon
becomes obvious-that there is some
sort of cover—up and Serling wants to

Meg Ryan is the center of controver-
sy in Courage Under Fire.

Harriet the Spy a surpisingly good children's film

filmview

Harriet the Spy
Directed by Bronwen Hughes

 

What can I say about Bronwen
Hughes’ Harriet the Spy ? This film
has all the ingredients necessary for
some serious cheese. There is the
loveable nanny (believe it or not
Rosie O’Donnell), the oblivious and
cartoonish parents, the obnoxiously
spoiled class president, the merciless

S _ classmates, and, of course, Harriet M.

Welsh (Trachtenberg) — the fearless

 ': sixth grader who thinks she’s one hell
of a savvy spy, observing everything
with her spy—gear and writing it down

in her spy—notebook. Sounds like typ-
ical pre-teen flick stuff, but in the
end, was it cheese? The answer is no,

1 not exactly.

For those who haven’t read
Louise Fitzhugh’s best-selling novel

of the same title, the twists and turns
that the filmmaker chooses to follow
are unexpected, interesting — and
pleasantly original. Douglas Petrie
and Theresa Rebeck’s screenplay
(from an adaptation) is top-notch, and
director Hughes’ execution of the
twist—tangled story was wonderful,

‘fun, and most of all, energetic

(despite the two MTVish play-in—th_e—
park sequences). Many of these

inspired twists eventually led to some

poignant and utterly captivating
scenes. And don’t be fooled, there
were even some tear-jerking
moments, which is rare in-a children’s
action-comedy film.

The somewhat faithful—to-the-
book story initially follows carefree
Harriet in her daily routine, accompa-
nied by her two 12 year-old friends, a
psuedo-scientist named Janie
(Vanessa Chester) and an unforget-
tably good—natured boy named Sport
(Greg Smith). But when her class-

mates (including Janie and Sport) dis-
cover that her private spy—notebook
contains some truthful but not-so-nice
comments about them, they all gang
up and turn against Harriet. To make
matters worse, her nanny (who also
serves as her wise and trusted men-
tor) feels that it is time to move on,
despite the 11-year stay with her
beloved Harriet. Then the story takes
a somewhat dark and disturbing turn,
and I was both amazed and appalled
to watch Harriet wreak her sweet
revenge by individually humiliating
each and eyery one of her classmates,
viciously crossing out their names
inscribed on her wooden desk as she
finishes the dirty work. Pretty serious
stuff.

But of course, this is essentially a
children’s' film, and if kid—movies
turn you off, I highly recommend
against seeing Harriet the Spy. Still. I
am sure that all of us can appreciate
the fresh ideas and inventive charac-

ters that the film introduces. Harriet
and crew were loveable and fun to
watch — and their cynical attitudes
were highly entertaining. Yet, inter-
estingly enough, there were those few
disturbing conflicts that made me
question what age bracket this film is
targeted at. Regardless, the energy
and fantasies we all held near and
dear to our sixth—grade hearts make
up the strong», driving force behind
each scene. I’m sure all of us can
relate in some way or another to these
familiar concepts.

Despite the somewhat contrived
quick and tidy resolution, I found this
film ultimately and genuinely enter-
taining. And although one could
argue that sixth-grade enemies can
become friends at the drop of a hat, it
is watching this actual process unfold
through Harriet & Co. that provides
all the laughter, tears, and excitement.

It’s Only Time
Mark Curry
Virgin Records

This album is a collection
of blues—inﬂuenced pop rock
that combines some of the best
elements of the both genres.

Mark Curry’s vocals are a
mix of the finest voices quali-
ties of Chris Robinson of the
Black Crowes, Brian Adams,
and Janis Joplin. If you think
there is nothing good about any
of these, stop right here. This
album is simply not for you.

However, if you can appre-
ciate’ these parts and excellent
guitar work, then this may be
one you want to have the record
store order. Waddy Wachtel, a
producer and session man for
Warren Zevon, ‘appears on near-
ly all the tracks, proving his
prowess on the slide, electric,
and acoustic guitars. He’s an
excellent addition to any album,
and this one is no exception.

The album opens up with a
bluesy song “All Over Me.” It
sets the" tone for the album,
which is one of some darkness
but not total loss. While the
album as a whole is not full of
the realistic optimism that char-
acterizes true blues music, it is
not full of the standard teen

angst lyrics.

The third song “Sorry
About the Weather” is a good
one for Pittsburgh: “Sorry about
the weather, ‘you say it’s rainin’
there all the time/readin’ about
it in your letter I say give it a
little while.” This song is the
closest to true blues in its
instrumentation and lyrics. This
is by far the best song on a solid
album with few weak points.

“Gone Swimming” opens
up side two with another blues-
inﬂuenced song. It deals with
nostalgia and apprehension.

“Always a Place” is a per-
fect song for anyone who has
been separated for any length of
time from his (can I use the
term) significant other? It is
about the pain of separation,
and since the circumstances in
the song are concrete, it fits

. . . P .
- nicely into whatever situagon

through which you may be suf-

fering at the moment. 

The album _as a whole
would appeal to anyone looking
for something a little different
from top 40 radio, but some-
thing not so far off the beaten
track that they can’t recognize
it. It is in the same vein as
Micheal Penn’s Free For All ;
a well done album for those
who appreciate music and
lyrics along with some mean-
ing-

Intrepid tank commander Denzel Washington is on the case.

Courage

0 from page 9

find out why.

What results is an amaz-
ing tale of conﬂicting stories
that leaves everybody guess-
ing until the final scene. The
script by Patrick Sheane
Duncan (who also wrote Mr.
H0lland’s Opus and Nick of
Time) is incredibly complex
and the truth seems to get

buried the more that Serling

investigates.

Courage Under Fire is a
great break from the tradition-
al summer films with great
acting performances instead
of amazing special effects.
Denzel Washington does a
fine job as Serling, but it is
the great moments by the sup-
porting cast that really make
the film work. Lou Diamond
Phillips and Matt Damon both
provide excellent perfor-
mances, at times stealing the
show from the main stars.

Director Edward Zwick
does a good job of pacing the

film; there is never a dull
moment. However, there
seems to be something miss-
ing from the background of
Meg Ryan’s character.
Although there are bits and
pieces of her life thrown in,
the viewer is left wondering if
something has been cut from
the film. Perhaps something
was, considering the trailers
feature scenes that don’t
appear in the film. .

Zwick’s direction is ade-
quate, if a bit Hollywood-
ized. He does manage to stay
away from a traditional
Hollywood “everybody’s
happy” ending, which is a
definite plus.

Courage Under Fire is
worth a look, though it may
not be the “early Oscar con-
tender” the ads proclaim it to
be. It is still a darn good
movie and an entertaining one

. as well.
