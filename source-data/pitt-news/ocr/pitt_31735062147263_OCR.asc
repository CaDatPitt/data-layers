Contest Winners
Get Cups As INA _
Convention ‘Ends

Speeches, Banquets, Luncheons,
Dances, Awarding Of Prizes
Feature Journalistic Meet

Three cups were awarded by the In-
tercollegiate Newspaper Association
Saturday to member papers for the
editorial, advertising, and news‘ cov-
erage excellence.' The ﬁrst cup was

‘won by the Red and Black of Wash-

ington and Jefferson College“, and The
News of Temple University carried

the last two honors.

Cha.rles A. Wright of Temple Uni-
versity, acting executive secretary of
INA, was unanimously ‘elected sec-
retary. At the same meeting on
Saturday morning the University ‘of
Delaware, in Newark, Delaware, was
elected, by a close margin, as host for
the Spring convention.

Highlights of the convention in-
cluded adoption by a 16-14 vote of a
resolution for non-participation by the
United States in the Olympic games
at Berlin next year.

Governor George H. Earle was the
main speaker at the formal banquet
Friday night. Included in the Gover-
nor’s remarks was a suggestion to col-
lege editors to defend academic free-
dom and to expose any repression of
it. The Governor said:

“I believe the college journals of
the country can perform a great public
service by standing ﬁrm as the defend-
ers of academic freedom. There can
be no real education without full dis-
cussion of all questions, unhampered
by restrictions and taboos.

Sees Fine Opportunities

On University administration guid-
ance of student edi.tors, he said:

“There is, of course, always a point
where guidance ends and dictatorship
begins. It is the responsibility of the
college editor to know where that
point is, since he stands between the
college authorities on one hand and
the student body on the other.

“I hope that all of you will realize
the tremendous value of free speech
and will uphold it even when the exer-
cise of that right conﬂicts with your
personal opinions or convictions.”

In the main, Gover,,r_1_or--Earle spoke
to the ..j_purnalists f"co_l.l_e e,,,§ggdents
un1tiés"in‘
the professional world. He reminded
the delegates not to allow the acci-
dent of high birth to make them feel
superior to others.

Other speakers who discussed vari-
ous phases of newspaper and advertis-
ing work were: Edward T. Leech, ed-
it_or of the Pittsburgh Press; ‘I-Ierbert
Moore, president of Transradio Press
Service; CY Hungerford, nationally
known cartoonist of the Post-Gazette;
I. D. Wolfe, widely known advertising
man and. executive; Paul Ramsey,
president of. the local Newspaper
Guild; Andrew Connolly, advertising
director; R."X. ‘Graham, director of
publicity at the University; and Graf-
ton Duvall, publicity director, Philadel-
phia Company.

Attending the Pitt-Nebraska game
in a body and an informal dance at the
Hotel Schenley Saturday_night were
social highlights of the delegates’
stay here.

$1 Formal Dance
Is Next CA Event

“Most Inexpensive Of Its Kind,”
Says Committee In Charge

The College Association’s semester
formal, already announced as a $1
per‘ couple affair, traditionally will

.take ‘place on Thanksgiving Eve.

Paul Keiser, ’36, president, a11d Wil-
liam Hughes, '36, social chairman, also
announce that the Grotto Ballroom on
the Northside has been obtained for
the dance.

The Grotto, scene of many CA
dances, is one of the few ballrooms
in Pittsburgh able to accommodate
comfortably the 500 couples expected
\Vednesday,' November 27, say the

oﬁicers. At the semester informal in
October, more than 425 couples——
probably a record for Association
dances—purchased $1 membership
tickets.

The coming CA dance is the most
inexpensive formal affair in Univer-
sity history, according to records.
Last year, when combination mem-
bership tickets carrying admission to
both dances were sold for $2, admis-
sion to any one of the two was still
set at .32. This year’s policy of sell-
ing tickets at $1 straight for each
dance has led to almost double at-
tendance.

Tickets will go on sale this morning
in the College oflice, Room 205, State
Hall, in the dean of men’s oﬂice, Room
801, Cathedral, and with individual
members of the cabinet. Included in
the cabinet are: Keiser, Hughes, Edwin
Beachler, ’3_7_, Theodore VVhitaker, ’38,
Lucy Conn, ’38, Charles B. Holstein,
’36, Beverly Brown, ’37,. Gertrude
Schein, ’36, Anne June Elmer, ’36,
Doris Evans, ’37, Anthony Lucas, ’37,
Al Duff, ’36, Charles Roofner, ’38,
Eleanor Humphries, '36, Ray Scheib,
’37, Martha Fuller, ’37.

Hop Committee Meets

All members of all committees of
the Sophomore Hop are to meet with
D. C. Schultz, chairman, at 2:30
o’clock today in Room 709, Cathedral.

Te Ata Presents
Indian Folk Lore

Choctaw Indians Tell Stories, Sing,
Dance For Student Audience

Figures from old Indian legends,

Manitou, Old Man, and many others,
came to life again in the gloomy
depths of Memorial Hall Friday when
Princess Te Ata and Kuruks Paheti
presented a program of Indian stories,
dances, and songs- , _

Princess Te Ata, who is a full-blood-
ed Choctaw Indian, began the pro-
gram with the narration of’ several
traditional stories which were told.
with skill and feeling. Most of the
stories, Te Ata explained, were so
old‘that no man remembered where
they came from or how they started.

Possibly the high spot in the whole
program was the Pipe dance number.

This was danced by Te Ata to the ac-__
'-c"o'm‘p’ani'ment""o'f' Ki1ruks"Paheti’s sing‘-0'

ing. The dance signiﬁes the thanks-
giving of the Indians to the still god
after the harvest.

In a short discussion before one of
his songs Kuruks Paheti dispelled the
idea that Indians have no sense of
humor. The red man, he claimed has
been labeled falsely. Although he ex-
hibits sober mien most of the time,
some of his songs and stories do re-
veal a quiet and well-developed sense
of humor. Kuruks Paheti illustrated
his theory by singing “The Chant.of
The Happy Heart.” ,

Both Te Ata and Kuruks Paheti
spoke without the slightest trace of-
accent. The latter is a graduate of
Ohio State University an.d the former
studied at Carnegie Tech.

Kuruks Paheti's songs were sung
to the accompaniment of a drum. To
ears accustomed to the rhythms and
harmonies‘ of conventional music, the
sounds were strange and almost with-
out meaning.

Medical Aptitude
Tests Scheduled
F or December 6

Medical aptitude tests, which are
used as a partial basis for admission
to a majority of medical schools in
the United States and are adminis-
tered by the Committee of the Asso-
ciation of American Medical Colleges,
have been scheduled for December 6
at the University.

According to Dr. Omar C. Held, per-
sonnel assistant to the dea.n of the
College and director of the adminis-
tration of the tests at the University,
the tests will begin a.t 3:30 o’clock, in
Room 315, Alumni Hall.

The test requires approximately an
hour and a half and covers some of
the material that is likely to be en-
countered by students in Schools of
Medicine.

Last year the tests were taken by
10,569 students of 617 colleges, and
were used by approximately 90 per
cent of the approved Medicine Schools
in the United States as a factor in the
selection of their students. Of this
number, 236 students at the Univer-
sity took the test. Dr. Held expects
about 250 to take the test this year.

Dr. Held emphasized the fact that
it is not necessary that all pre-medical
requirements be completed at the
time the test is taken if the require-
ments will be completed in time for
entrance to the School of Medicine in
the fall of 1936.

Upon the payment of a one dollar
fee, the applicants will be given re-
ceipts which will admit them to the
examination room. This fee is pay-
able at the treasurer’s oflice, Room 7,
State Hall.

Entertain Bizad Faculty

Dr, Charles S. Tippetts, dean of
the School of Business Administra-
tion, and his wife entertained the
faculty of the School of Business Ad-
ministration and their wives at a tea
given at the Tippetts’ home yester-
day. There were approximately 60
guests.

She Hit On A 7500 To 1 Shot,
But Still Flunlazed The Exam

 

By Robert Saffron

The laws of probability were very
good to her.

“She” is a sophomore who took the
political science departments true-
false test recently. The reason she
must remain anonymous is that she
ﬂipped a coin for each answer—
“heads,” true; “tails,” false.

Her ﬁnal score was eight. And it
was a remarkable score in the opin-
ion of Dr. J. S. Taylor, professor of
mathematics, who has made a study
of the scoring of objective tests.

“With correct answers counting
plus one and incorrect answers minus
two, the coin answered 62 accurately
and missed on only 27. The marvel-
ous thing is that she didn’t get a min-
us score.”

The number of possible sequences
in tossing a coin 89 times, he ex-
plained, is 619 septillion (619 follow-
ed by 24 zeros). Of these cases, 82
sextillion (82 and 21 zeros) would
give 62 or more correct. This means
that there was but one chance in

7,500 the copper would do that well.

The possibilities are even worse
when considered from another angle.
There is about one chance in 12 that
a ﬂipped coin will fall half “heads”
and half “tails.” For 62 “heads” and
27 “tails” the chance is one in 12,900.

And so the girl in question was
very lucky, although her score was a
ﬂunk. But then other students. who
took the quiz without beneﬁt of the
toss, made even lower.

Dr. James C. Charlesworth, assist-
ant professor of political science who
is somewhat of a mathematician in
his way, advises the student to stay
away from penny-ﬂipping:

‘‘If a person ﬂips a coin, the greater
the number of questions on an exam-
ination the more nearly his score will
approach zero. In the same way, the
greater the number of students who
ﬂip coins, the closer their average
score will be to zero.

“Taking it from another angle, as
Dr. Taylor did, no matter how many
times you ﬂip a coin on a test, the
‘head’ is never involved.”

Host At December Conclave

C Newlvo-Pledging  

Period Success,
‘ Informs Seidle

According to N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men and ad-

'viser to Interfra_ternity Council, the

new '30-day period,nending- 'l’*h_u'rsday‘
in which freshmen are not permitted
to pledge social fraternities, has
proved a complete success.

“The freshmen have taken a new
serious attitude toward fraternity
bidding,” says Seidle. According to
observers it was one of the most suc-
cessful rushing periods in the history
of University fraternities.

During the long rushing period of
10 days, 586 bids were extended to
374 men with 172 acceptances. This
year’s 596 bids are the peak in the
University ﬁles, although there were
190 pledging to social fraternities
after the 1933 rushing season.

Although Seidle refuses to state
how many new freshmen. will pledge
after‘ Thursday, there will -probably
be a number of freshmen who will
pledge after the 30-day period. "

After the no-pledging period fresh-
men may be pledged. bid for, and ac-
cepted into fraternities.

Three Days Iieft
For Chest Drive

Shideler Asks Students To Make
Pledges As Soon As Possible

With three full da.ys left in which
to fulﬁll- the University’s quota of
$12,000, as part of‘ the $2,800,000 Com-
munity Fund drive, the Campus
Chest committee is actively engaged
in group and private solicitation.

According to Emerson Shideler,
C37, chairman of the student division.
students should make their pledges
and contributions as soon as possi-
_ble,., so as. to facilitate, arrangements
for the collection of "funds." ’

Shideler further added, “Only
pledges are being solicited at this
time. and students are given until De-
cember 4 to make their pledges good
at the treasurer’s office, in State
Hall.”

In commenting on the progress of
the campaign thus far, Mr. William
VV. Mendenhall, executive secretary
of the YMCA and faculty adviser to
the student committee of the Campus
Chest, said, “The response this year
has been generally better than in pre-
vious years and has indicated a ﬁne
sense of co-op'eration and a generous
attitude on the part of the student
body. Several classes have shown al-
most 100 per cent enrollment in the
drive, particularly several college
orientation, English, and engineer-
ing classes.”

“Although complete tabulations on
the success of the pledges have not
been made,” Mendenhall concluded.
“we are conﬁdent that this year’s
drive will be a success.”

both the rural districts and in the ex-
panding cities,” says John O’Tain,
C38, who has traveled extensively in
Roumania and who has made possible
the showing of the ﬁlm on campus.
“No University student can spend an
hour mor‘e proﬁtably than coming to
view this picture,”‘insists O”I.‘ain.

Plans are ..also being made,to pre-

sent several Roumanian dances and
a number of typical musical selections
from that-' nation. ~ . . '

Specialdnvitations have been sent
to some 60 freshman men, a large
number of whom are expected to at-
tend. Refreshments will be served
at the close of the program. '

" 1 Like Father, Like‘ Son

HERE IS SOMETHING more than mere tra-
Tdition to the.fact that there are 58 freshmen

whose mothers or fathers were graduated from
the University. Selecting the institution for one’s

- son or daughter is not always done for sentimental

reasons alone.
We believe we are not guilty of overstatement

when wesay that alumni have found at Pitt the.

training and. education and culture which they

‘ soughtr Certainly we can believe this when the
: records show that alumni more and more are eager

to have their own children share these same

. advantages.

There’ are, of course, many npperclass students

at the"University whose mothers or fathers are
' listed among the University graduates.
ﬁcent fact is that the number of children of alumni
. who_ enter the freshman class each year is in-

The signi-

creasing.

-First Night Reviewer Discovers Players’
A Upeilgning Play ‘Is Not Quite, Tlie Thing’

..itaifcle== ‘off, a: “few ' yégu-sf" ' .,'ago, was not
’Am’eri;ca’s best -coinedy when Pitt
’Pla5yers :;presented" it‘ ‘Thursday eve-
ning.-’ . ' P " "

Aubrey ‘Piper, played by John
Parks, BA36, was convincing. ll-Ie
guffawed, gesticulated, ranted, and
made himself thoroughly obnoxious
until the audience was. told to consid-
er his virtues. Then he blossomed as
the hero, and the play ended on
schedule. .’ "

Yet the entire production missed
ﬁre. Kathryn Hall, C36, playing Mrs.
g-Fisher, did exceedinglywell as the
petty mother-in-law of the boastful
Piper. She was amusingly the old
lady next door, peevish, selﬁsh, nar-
row, yet ethnologically interesting.
Still, -all her rapid-ﬁre inanities could
not help. She was caught in a mesh
of detached acting.

The players were not working too
-hard“ The audience missed lines, and
the actors missed cues. There were
several trying moments, especially in
the ﬁrst act, and the heightened tem-
po of the second and third were still
lacking in the Kelly gusto.

We know the story. It is a mixture
of high and low fun, a little melo-
drama, some inconsequential bur-
lesque, and just a touch of satire.
The proportion of satire varies to the
extent in which one reads it.

Piper can be an exaggerated Bab-
bitt or simply a freak in the American
success saga. He can be representa-
tive, in other words, or merely unu-
sual. The atmosphere around Parks
made him a superﬁcial growth, not
a natural product_

There was a lot of humor in the
play, and the crowd caught on. “How
many noughts in $1-00,000?” Mrs.
Fisher asks. Everybody laughs. “I
wasn’t 1istenin’,” she says when chid-
ed, “I was only seein’ what he was
sayin’.”

A week from today an uncertain

' yet been"elected.’

‘Theuelection for the annual fall
tapping is scheduled Sunday after-

~. noon.- Monday morning, on the large

ODK key placed near State Hall, new
names will be placed every half hour.
Honorary and associate ‘ members
tapped will be recognized at that time,

along with the new - undergraduates
chosen.

The circle members have been
clutching a secret since Thursday
afternoon, when they elected mem-
bers of the faculty and several men
outside the University. Neither wind,
nor ﬁre, nor rain, nor the Four Horse-
men of the Apocalypse will release it
prematurely.

At the Thursday meeting, N. Robert
Seidle, banquet committee chairman,
annourced that the Alumni banquet
will be held in the new Faculty Club
rooms in the Cathedral. Approximate-

ly 100 active and alumni members of

the circle are expected at the Decem-
ber 2 affair.

Russell Connolly, C36, president of
ODK, predicted Friday. “W'e shall
probably have a smaller-than-usual
list _of undergi-adiiate tappees this
year, The new scholarsliip require-
ment, which lists a minimum quality

head . of the dep_a_1:tme_nt of zoology.

' was "e"lect'ed president of the biology

section of the Western Pennsylvania
Educational Association at a recent
‘meeting. _

Plans are being made by the group,
according to Doctor Hance, to bring
about a closer union of high school
teachers of biology by putting in their
hands material which would not
otherwise be" available to them. This
is to be accomplished in part through
the publication of a magazine at a fu-
ture date.

PBI To Talk Business
At [Meeting Wednesday

Pitt Business Institute, business ad-
ministration student organization,
will hold a business session Wednes-
day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in Room
200, Alumni Hall.

“Come prepared to make sugges-
tions and help arrange plans for the
future,” says, Elmer E. Schriber, Jr.,
BA37, president.

Members and those who enrolled at
the Druid Smoker are urged to attend.

Being an engineer at the University
has some compensation. At least
that is the opinion of the group that
was entertained as the guests of this
year’s automobile show in Motor
Square Garden last VVednesday.

Conducted by Henry C. Pavian, as-
sistant professor of aeronautical en-
gineering, the group entered the show
as non-paying guests of the manage-
ment. They were greeted on all sides
by demonstrators with the latest
devices in the automobile industry.:‘-*

VVind-shields were shattered for
their beneﬁt to display the new types
of glass. Moving pictures ‘showing
the new cars in action were especially
interesting to the group. . "

that lines in many instances
not too well memorized. Particularly
guilty on this score was Beverly Chil-
dress, 7038, who missed cues frequent-
ly. Otherwise, Miss Childress did a
fairly creditable job, although her
performance might have been made a
little more p,assiona.te. She‘ played
the role of Amy, who was steeped in
adoration of her husband,Aubrey Piper.

Audrey Graham, C37, was quite tol-
erable as Clara, sister of Amy, but it
seemed as though she‘ lacked some-
thing. She might have made Clara
a. triﬂe more real by feeling the part.
She had expression and-poise, but her
rendering of the lines was compara-
ble to a ﬁne classroom recitation.

John Weisbrod, C39,,did well as
Frank Hyland, the quiet and rather
self-sufficient husband of Clara.
Weisbrod’s was a. straight part, so
not too much couiu be expected. How-
ever, it could have been made a little
brighter, perhaps, by less sluggish
acting.

Richard Frankel,’ C39, did the char-
acter role of Mr. Fisher, grumpy,
grouchy head-of-the-house, and did it
not at all badly. His voice was deep
and appropriate.

time. .Madden was criticised by some

for being too colorless, but there is a
reasonable amount of doubt on this
score.‘ '

Chalmers Brown, Ed37, was good as

that he was old, he nevertheless
cringed too much, and spoke in too
hollow a tone, one felt.

‘Mr. Rogers,- the. insurance sales-

Panthers Learn
Cornhuskers Are
  Tough To Husk

Pitt‘ Attack-"Moves" Merrily’ Along,
P But  Proves. 
K ' 7 Big ‘Pastor, mm) i$<‘=o.r.é;;  

 

‘If Sam Francis, Nebraska's left-
footed fullback, can husk . corn the
way he can boot "a football, he'd win a
‘blue ribbon in anybody’s husking bee.
Francis it" was'who__time andaga-iI_1
kicked the Panthers offthe 803-1 line
doorstep as Pitt, managed, to pound
out a 6-0 victory over the lads from

_,I,..incoln_ at thejstadium Saturday.

A crowd or .38,00'0.sat with chilled
feet for 59 minutes of the. ball game,
and the. greater part? of it sat with

--‘chilled spines during the_ ﬁnal minute

when Nebraska made its
for-a touchdown. _

After a scoreless ﬁrst quarter, fea-
tured mainly’ by-‘Bobby LaRue’s '33;
yard run around left end, -Patrick

only real bid

' opened thesecondpquarter by ripping

off 18 yards to Nebraska's seven-y-ard
line on a fake reverse. Hub Randour ad-
vanced the ball‘ to the four, LaRue
sneaked" up two more, and a plunge

-‘by Patrick put the nose of the ball

-cheek to cheelrwgith -the Husker goal

"line. I

On the next play,.the Panther full-
back dove over the goal line to add yet
another touchdown ;to his long list.
With -LaRue holding the ball, Patrick's
kick for the extra point went wide of
the goal post.

After that everybody might as well
have gone home except for that ﬁnal
ﬂurry by Nebraska. While the Panth-
ers sported their slim lead, the game

‘settled downu to a kicking duel be-

tween Francis,'he of the mighty toe,
and Michelosen and Stapulis of Pitt.
Both Francis’ and ‘ Stapulis uncorked
an 80-yard punt to give the players
and officials considerable exercise at
walking up and down the gridiron.

Panther Fumble Starts It

With but oneminute and ten sec-
onds left to play, Leon Shedlosky, in
for LaRue, fumbled behind the line
of scrimmage and Morrison, Cornhusk-
er center, pounced on the ball on the
Pitt 32-yard stripe. On the next play
a pass from Bauer to Ca.rdwell brought
the Cornhusker tribedown to the 23-
yard line, and the thousands jamming
the exits halted in their flight.

Bauer then tossed a pass to Dohr-
mann, but the play lost a yard. Vin
Sites, who played another ﬁne game
at end for the Blue and Gold, then
threw Francis for a 12-yard loss on an
attempted forward pass, causing the
Nebraska substitutes to sit down
again on the benches and one way
traffic to be resumed at the Stadium
exits.

Pitt counted 12 ﬁrst downs to the
Huskers’ four, and outgained the visi-

tors, 218 yard-s~to-=74-.-»-T~he~—~Pan-ther»

safety men carried back punts for a
total of 62 yards while Nebraska’s
runba.cks netted exactly nine.

Outstanding in the game was the
play of Pitt’s line, which charged with
all the ferocity of the Light Brigade
and with a great deal more success.
Again no individual shone above the
others, but theateam performed in the
manner of the same well-knit unit
which mowed down the Army. It was
only the fact that it was a lot easier
for this pesky Francis to account for
yards with his left foot than it was
for the Panthers to gain on the ground
and in the air that kept the team bat-
tling on close terms.

Did You Know . .

- By Harold W. Byers

That the Panther football team has
had nine undefeated teams? These
coaches
1910, '1915, ‘1916, 1917,
1927, 1929, and 1932.

That the highest score the Panthers
ever rolled up was in 1914, when the
Blue and Gold garnered 96 points
against Dickinson College?

That the highest score ever made
against the University of Pittsburgh
was in the Rose Bowl game on Janu-
ary 1, 1930, when a mighty Trojan
team humbled the Panthers, 47-14?

That the Panthers had a winning
steak of 33 games in a row from the
next to last game of the 1914 season
under the direction of Coach Duff to
the second game of the 1919 season
under Coach Warner? The teams of
1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919. were
coached by Pop Warner.

That the most points the Panthers
ever amassed in one season was in
1927, when one of Pitt's strongest
elevens managed to gather 289 points.
Three other teams went over the 280
mark, however, the teams of 1910 and
1929 were able to push across 282
points, and the 1930 aggregation man-
aged t0 keep the opponents fooled
long enough to score 280 points.

That the lowest number of points
that the Panthers ever scored in one
season was in 1911, when Pitt backs
could only ﬁnd the goal line for 72
points? ‘

That the most Pitt victories over
one school are against West Virginia?
The Panthers have ﬁnished on the
long end 18 games out of 22 played.
W & J also took it on the chin 18 out
of 25 played.

its Indian-signlhold on ‘24 of the fastest harrier collegiate squads at”2':30

ly through the efforts" of Tom Ottey, whocracked the existing mark for the
race in 1934 with a fast 31 minute, 54.6 second trek over the ﬁve-mile route.

It will be. a tough climb. for the¢

Michigan Staters to repeat, with last
year’s runner-up Maine club very.
much in the running," boasting another
ﬁne team, not to mention challenging
threats -from ‘Manhattan, Yale, Cor-
nell, ‘Columbia, ‘Syracuse and others.-.

Edwin Beysey,- second-place win-
ner in 1934, looks. like a good bet for
the individual 'title.. Barney Gedwil‘-
as,. West Virginia’s ace, will proba-
bly not compete, according to latest
reports from Morgantown.

Pitt's hopes, led by Red Tost, are
pretty ‘much anb-unknown‘ quantity.
with only an outside chance of cop-
ping or placing close to the top in
the team standings. So far, Olson’s
squad has failed to show the form ex-
hibited by last year’s Panthers.

:The Olsonmen took sixth in 1934,
with "Charles" Kirkpatrick ﬁnishing
high in the sixth position; Kirk Was

a. minute slower than the record time.
Wagenhouser with a 37th, Albright
just behind with a 43rd, Howe in
50th, and Tost in 55th registered a
team total of 193 f« r the Panthers.

Charley Groat is the only Pitt man,
in addition to Tost, with IC4A expe-
rience, ‘Groat placed 102nd last year.
Alexander Leggin, the third member
of this year’s varsity, has been com-
ing along fast and lacks only cham-
pionship exﬁerience. George Cook,
senior, appears to be in practically
the same spot as Leggin. Franklyn
Theriault and Jack"Emens, the other
two varsity members, are sophomores
with possibilities.

In the 1934 race, the ﬁrst 10 teams
ﬁnished as follows: ﬁrst, Michigan
State; second, Maine; third, Manhat-
tan; fourth, Yale; ﬁfth, Cornell;
sixth, Pitt; seventh, Harvard; eighth,
Penn State; ninth, Syracuse; tenth,

The 24 varsity entries included
teams from the following colleges:
Alfred, Carnegie Tech, Colby, C. C.
N. Y., -Columbia_ Dartmouth‘, Ford-
ham, Harvard, Lafayette, Maine, Man-
hattan, M. I, T., Michigan State, New
York U., Penn State, Pennsylvania,
Pitt, Princeton, Rhode Island, Rut-

which is just around the corner.

There are two candidates for the

last_year, but Garcia has been step-
ping high lately in practice and prom-
ises to give the Noonboy a battle.
Noon, however, has been laid up fora
time through sickness, and it may be
that the high one has not shown his
true stuff as yet. Garcia, a junior,
saw some action during the past sea-
son and perhaps will see more this
season. ' ‘

A trio of sophomores, Rags Radvan-

vitch, are the outstanding candidates
for the forward positions vacated by
Claire Cribbs and Skippy Hughes.
Each held a ﬁrst string place on
Docky Kowallis’ excellent frosh team
last year. Radvansky and Zeleznik,
teamed at the front of that team,
played through high school together,
having prepped at Duquesne. Ed
was a former South High star, and

Men Get Sjirtorial Advice
In Latest Fashion Reporter

 

The current issue of Fa.shion Re-
porter, bulletin issued by the Re-
search Bureau for Retail_Training, in-
dicates that the. dominant trend in

men’s furnishings for this season is
deep tones, or perhaps better desig-
nated as “Baritones.”

Suits show a tendency toward soft
lounge construction as in the English
styleof coats. .“Smooth” is the word
for the fall silhouette, both literally
and ﬁguratively. Jackets are slight-
ly longer and buttons are placed low-
er, giving the appearance of height.
An outstanding style, is a double-
breasted jacket with long roll lapel,
rolling to bottom button. -

Perhaps the most popular style is
a single’-breasted jacket with notched
shawlr ‘collar ; (collar« as wide as.
lapels), and three buttons, allowing,-
fullness at chest and shoulder blades
(just the center button, or top _and

. center, fastened).

The British influence is apparent in
the suiting patterns, especially the
very popular xstripes. These vary in

colors and designs: pin, shadow,
chalk, cable stripes, and alternate
stripes. There is a skillful blending

of strong clear colors in all-over pat-
terns and herringbone weaves. From
the Scottish clans come plaids,
checks, overplaids, and mixtures.
Even formal wear stresses color.
Midnight blue, blacker than black un-
der night lights, is receiving much

-popular

recognition. Other rich shades ap--
pear in accessories, such as jewelry,
Waistcoats, and boutonnieres. ,

“Men are headed towards costume‘
jewelry," says “Men’s Wear.” Cravat.
chains, buckles, initialed pins, and
streamlined belt buckles are notable.
For evening wear, dull gold studs and
cuff-links are important.

Sweaters and jackets are always.
on the college campus be-~
cause‘of their comfort and colors. The
slide-fastened-front sweater is popu-
lar because it combines features of‘
the pullover and cardigan. It is made
in, brushed wool heather mixtures.
(varied shades of one color). Fancy‘
backs are better than ever, belted
with shirring or pleats, plain fronts:
with pockets; or a Cossack style for
a. shorter sweater. Solid colors are in
the lead for favor, but checks and
squares hold‘ their own. Jackets are
increasing in favor, with their full-
cut details, and buttoned leather
jackets, .belted all the way around,
rate with the college men. Smooth
glove leathers, such as capeskin, are-
favored because they clean better.

As to shirts-—colors are more ini-
portant than ever, and stripes rate.
Pin stripes in alternating colors, such
as gray, red, and blue on gray back-
ground; candy stripes and tape-
stripes in deep smoothly blended
shades, such as burgundy red, green,
gray, gold, and blue. Oxford cloth is
the popular fabric.

Rushees Observe

will be exchanged by fraternity wo-
men and their rushees, which include
