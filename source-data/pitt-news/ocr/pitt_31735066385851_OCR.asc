The Towers‘ laundry room was closed to conserve Water.

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

A large oil spill on the Allegheny
River may force Pitt students and
area residents to start conserving
water.

On Saturday morning, a large
oil pipeline in the Freeport area
ruptured because of a landslide.
Over 250,000 gallons of transmix,
a petroleum byproduct, leaked
into the river, causing the water
problem.

According to T om Hussey,
director of Facilities Management
at Pitt, the spill has not caused a
crisis situation yet.

“Our water comes from a plant
in Aspinwall,” he said, “and the
oil hasn’t gotten that far
downstream as of yet. Therefore,
there is not an emergency at this
time.”

Hussey said that the university
is preparing for any upcoming
problems. “Our main concern is
for the students on campus and
the hospitals,” he said. “Right

now we are getting prepared for
any upcoming curtailments, if

Greek Week ends, St. Francis Wins

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

For the past few days, Pitt
Greeks have performed
Broadway favorites, raced up and
down Forbes Avenue hunting for
purple toothbrushes and green
lollipops and made the Syria
Mosque smell worse than the
Panther locker room after the
Pitt/Penn State game.

Fraternities and sororities
performed works from Les
Miserables, South Paciﬁc, The
Sound ofMusic and various other
productions at Wednesday
evening’s Greek Sing.

Betsy Southorn, overall co-
chairwoman, said of the event,
“Charity is the key word here
tonight. We are all competing
against each other, but the real
winner is St. Francis [Medical
Center].”

Seven judges rated the
fraternities and sororities in the
categories of use of harmony,
voice projection, clarity, difficulty
and execution of choreography,
creativity, use of stage, overall
performance and costumes.

Sigma Alpha Mu won best
costume in the fraternity division
with Chi Omega in the sorority
division. Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority and Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternity won most original.

Sigma Chi won first place of
the fraternities for their
performance of “There’s Nothing
Like a Dame” from South Pacific.
Chi Omega sorority won first
place for their performance of a
medley of Disney favorites.

Lloyd Webber musical Cats and
Delta Delta Delta sorority, who
performed “The Lullaby of
Broadway” and “We’re in the

performance of Cole Porter’s
“Anything Goes,” as did a
rendition of “Master of the House”
from Les Miserables by the
brothers of Pi Kappa Phi.

Local businesses hosted
several Greeks during their
scavenger hunt on Thursday
evening.

Only after being sent to Roy
Rogers Family Restaurants, The
Country’s Best Yogurt, Alex’s
Flowers, Mister Donut, Baskin
Robbins, Domino’s Pizza, Kinko’s,
Pizza Hut and Hillman Library
did fraternities and sororities

receive a list of 40 scavenger-

     
 

hunt items. A
Among the list of items
Greeks rushed to find were:
spools of gold thread, guitar picks,
bottles of red nail polish, menus
from Chinese restaurants and
Styrofoam packing “worms.”
The seven—brother team from
Pi Kappa Phi was the first to
return with its bag of “treasures,”
followed by brothers of Sigma

[Alpha Epsilon in second and

sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta in
third.

The 24-hour dance marathon,
sponsored by Roy Rogers and
hosted by co—chairs Marc Troke
and Kristi Ifft, kept students
dancing for an entire day.

jimmy Roach and Steve
Hansen of Magic 97—FM opened
for Modern Man with a song
about five sisters of Delta Delta
Delta who were arrested for
canning in Upper St. Clair on
Thursday evening.

Roy Rogers provided the
dancers with three meals, and
beverages were provided by
Cameron Coca—Cola. Dancers
were also provided with fresh
fruit, frozen yogu rt, ice pops and
candy from various other
sponsors.

The co-chairs kept the 624
dancers entertained during their
breaks with group games such as
Twister and checkers.

During the marathon,
students could fill out applications .
for Kaufmann’s credit cards, with
$1 from each completed
application being donated to St.
Francis’ “Courage to Come Back”
campaign.

Spill forces Pitt to conserve water

there are any.”

He also said that Pitt students
should be prepared to decrease
their water use.

“The housing department has
already taken some action, such
as shutting down the laundry
systems in the dormitories,” he
said. “Actions such as these will
be taken as they are deemed
necessary.”

Hussey said that the cafeteria
will be affected as well. “Students
will be asked to use paper plates
and plastic cups for the time
being to avoid using water to
clean dishes,” he said. “Also, the
cafeteria will start making foods
which require less water to
prepare.” .

According to City
Commissioner T om Foerster, the
city of Pittsburgh hasn’t seen the
worst of the spill yet. At a press
conference yesterday, he
described the problems that are
being faced upstream.

“Harrison Township [water
intake] is completely closed," he
said. “They are getting water only
from the water buffaloes [tankers]

SUE ONE HUNDRED o

 

that have been set up. Oakmont
is also closed, but they have a
reservoir that should last about
two days.” ,

Foerster said that the spill was
20 miles long, and in some spots,
it was as much as 20 feet deep.
“We were told that 100,000 gallons
were spilled,” he said. “But with
size margins that large, it could
be four times that amount.”

According to Dick Rogers,
superintendent of Allegheny
County’s Emergency
Management Team, the situation
is starting to improve slightly.
“The slick is beginning to break
up somewhat, and the seepage
into the river is also going down,”
he said.

Large amounts of water are
being rushed to the affected areas
to help with the burden. Sixty-
seven water buffaloes have been
set up in the communities along
the river, and according to other
city officials, there mightbe more
than 100 set up later.

Foerster estimated that up to
900,000 people have been
affected by the spill so far.

Credit Card nightmares become some students’ realities

BY Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Getting a student American
Express card seemed to be a
great way for Marie Hernandez to
get by when she was short of

cash.

Hernandez was a sophomore
at Pennsylvania State University
and working part time as a typist
when she applied for the card.
She planned to use the credit to
tideher over between paychecks.

“It seemed like a great idea. I

than I could afford. The first

that once some of her friends found
out she had a card, things started to
change.

“Whenever all of us were short of

g money and we went out to dinner or

something, it seemed like they almost
expected me to pick up the tab.
What was I supposed to say? That I
couldn’t when they knew I had the
card? They all said they would pay
me back, but then when the bill
came, I guess Iwas justembarrassed
about asking. Since I was doing
things for them, I figured I deserved
to reward myself once in a while
with something special, like a new
blouse or something,” she said.
When Hernandez lost her job near

Christmas time, she used the
card to charge gifts for her family
and friends.

“I didn’t tell my parents that I
had to leave myjob because I
didn’t want them to worry. I
didn’t have any money saved
because every penny of my
paychecks had been going to
that big bill. But I figured I
could work at a store back
home for a couple of weeks
during the break, use my
Christmas money to pay off the
bill, and then ﬁnd another job
when I got back to school,” said
Hernandez.

student’s record for several years.

“Different types of reports stay
on your record for different
amounts of time. Failing to pay
back a debt totally can stay on for
several years, but even reports of
late payments can be recorded
and can hurt you,” he said.

Scott added that a bad credit
rating may affect more than your
ability to obtain credit cards.
Employers and landlords may
also check a person's record to
see if he or she has been
responsible with credit.

“Your credit rating is a reference
for your future performance. Like
it or not, that is what they are

 

going to look at,” he said. “You
have to take out credit that you
can handle.”

Representatives from lending
companies are a common sight
on the lower level of the William

companies a ﬂat rate of $65 per
day to rent one of the two spaces
available. Often, they offer
students free gifts just for ﬁlling

campaign aimed at students which
offers them discounted airfares

lodging with Days Inn.

According to the April 10, 1989,
issue of Fortune magazine, the
seven million full-time American
undergraduates spend over 10.5
billion dollars during each school
year in discretionary funds. That,
according to Fortune, is the reason
that these companies are after
students.

Jeff Burkhardt, marketing
director at On Campus Marketing
Concepts in New Jersey, cited

. another reason that creditors issue

cards to college students.

“It is obviously in the hopes of
gaining their future business once
they become professionals. As
they get older, they will continue
to raise their credit limit, and
that's profitable for the company,”
he said.

On Campus Marketing
Concepts offers Visa, Mastercard
and the Discover card to students
on over 1,500 campuses across
the country, including Pitt.
Burkhardt said that they are not
trying to exploit the students that
they offer the cards to.

“We generally only deal with
banks who offer the cards to
juniors and seniors. We think that

the best chance that they have to
acquire credit. Most banks are
more hesitant to offer it to them
after graduation.”

Burkhardt added that lending
companies have special policies
regarding college students.

“We carefully screen applicants
to make sure that they have an
income of at least $200 a month,
but that is very low compared to
the regular requirements, and that
can ‘ even come from an
allowance," he said. “On the other
hand, they usually have very low

GOODNIGHT IRENE! UNLV wins championship 103- 73

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian is
the winningest active coach in
college basketball. He added the
national championship to his .826
winning percentage last night as
his Runnin' Rebels embarrassed
the Duke Blue Devils by a score
of 103-73.

This marks the eighth time that
Duke has been to the Final Four
without bringing home the
naitonal championship.

game, from three-point shooting

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The calendar ‘said it was the
first of April, but the Pitt baseball
team saw, an accumulation of
snow on the ground and losses in
the standings.

The Panthers lost all three
games on their road trip to
Providence this past weekend.
The scores were 17-6, 7-0 and 14-
8.

, “We ran into a lot of bad
weather on the trip,” said Pitt
Coach Bobby Lewis. “Once we
got there, they had snow on the
ground, but the tarp kept the
snow off. Sunday, there was a
threat of rain, but we got all three
games in.”

In the first game of the

» doubleheader on Saturday, right-

handed pitcher Bill Brash got the
call. He lasted one and two-thirds
innings and gave up seven runs,
of which four were earned. The
Panthers committed six errors.
“We have to start minimizing our
errors,” said Lewis. ,
The second game had good
pitching for the Panthers but no

about it. 3

I was sitting at home watching
the tube one weekend not too
long ago, and I decided to turn
on ESPN. Expecting the standard
Saturday afternoon truck-and-
tractor pull, I was surprised to
find women’s tennis on instead.

Not just women’s tennis, but

the Lipton Invitational or
International or something like
that. Well, what’s in a name
anyway, right?

I was expecting some extremely
boring first-rou nd match between
two no-names, because ESPN is
notorious for televising first- and
second-round coverage of golf
and tennis events; thereby
weeding out the undesirables

offense. Left-handed Ralph
Cecere got his first start of the
season, and Lewis was impressed.
“For his first time out, he did
well. We were hoping we would
get a good outing from him, and
I believe we did. ” Cecere went all
nine innings and gave up eight
hits, seven walks and struck out
four Friar hitters.

In Sunday’s single game, the
Panthers started off by scoring
five runs in the top of the first.
The Friars came back with five of
their own in the bottom. The
Panthers scored two in the
second, while the Friars got three.
“We hit well, but [Fred] Iriti just
didn’t have it. He was wild, which
is not him. I don't know what
was wrong,” said Lewis. “He just
kept getting himself in trouble,
plus the defense was not there.”

Iriti lasted only two innings by
giving up two hits and five walks.
It was his worst performance of
the year. The defense contributed
another five errors to its already 3

Iriti gave up seven runs; only one

Ah, but no! Alas, Jennifer
Capriatiwas going to play Helena
Sukova, the second seed in the
tournament.

Now I had heard a lot, andl do
mean a lot, about 13-year-old
Jennifer Capriati. You know, how
she’s going to be the next Chris
Evert, how‘ amazing she was,

’ how bright a future she has ahead

of her, etc. etc.

Two weeks prior to the Lipton
event, Capriati reached the finals
of her first major tournament,
becoming the youngest player to
do so. Apparently, she whipped
Sukova in one of her matches,
and commentator BillieJean King
was absolutely convinced that
Capriati was going to have her
favor returned in this match.

First of all, Sukova is one of the
best players in the world. She is
about six foot two, and has a

Duke had made none of six.

Takanian said, "I never
expected anything like this. I told
the kids that this game was going
to come down to the last shot."

The only last shot the Rebels
were worried about taking was
the one that put them over the
century mark.

Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski
was quick to admit that he was
outmanned.

"We were over matched tonight.
[UNLV] is more athletic than we
are, they're better than we are.
There was no way we could beat
them tonight," Krzyzewski said.

"At the half, I thought we
collected ourselves, but they
never let down and never gave
us a chance to get back into the
ball game," he added.

When asked if there was any
added pressure or heartbreak as

was earned.

The offensive standouts of the
weekend were Brash, Blane Vucci
and Tim Gralewski. Brash saw
some action at third base after his
pitching start in the first game of
the trip. He went 3-4 in the second
game and 3-5 with a double in
the third. Vucci was 5 for 11 with
two home runs and five RBIs.
Gralewski went 2-for-4 with four
RBIs in the second game.

very serious ground strokes.
When these two players walked
onto the court, they looked like

Capriati had her hair tied back in
barrettes, a Swatch on her wrist

The Panthers’ overall record
dropped to 3-10, and their Big
East record fell to 0-6.

—NOTES-

Lewis feels that Providence
should give Seton Hall a good
run for the Big East title.
“Providence is a very good hitting
ball club, better than Seton Hall.”
According to Lewis, the Hall has
a edge in pitching because it is a
little deeper. “Seton Hall can go

Sukova looked like a giant next

The crowd was obviously
behind Capriati. Whenever a ball
was on the line, they screamed
and whistled as if the call should
have been ‘ “OUT!” Darling
Jennifer. America's newest sports
hero?

the pants (or tennis skirt) off
Sukova in two straight sets. This

title for his school, Krzyzewski
said, "I would have felt that way
if it were a one or two point ball

At the half, Duke mustered
only four points off of their fast
break, while the Runnin' Rebels

Capriati’s coach said before the
match thatJennifer’s strategy was
to be patient, and wait for her

Ah, youth. Capriati took
absolutely no heed to the
professional advice and slammed
every shot she could. Instead of
waiting for Sukova to make a
mistake, she made her make the
mistake.

After the first set, Sukova was
so ﬂustered, that she made some
very stupid mistakes. She double

The American League East
winner gets the right to lose to
the American League West winner
in the championship series. This
division is so tight theiCleveland
Indians could win it. Maybe that
is a little too much, but the division
is Pete Rozelle’s dream of parity.

The Toronto Blue Jays are the
defending champs and probably
could pull it off again. The
youthful Baltimore Orioles could
go in the tank like the Pirates did
after their resurgence, or they
could continue their strides
toward winning the AL East. The
Milwaukee Brewers can always
seem to find pitching somewhere
to keep their nose in there for the
photo finish. The Cleveland
Indians have added character in
Keith Hernandez and youth in
Sandy AlomarJr. The Boston Red
Sox have two closers in Lee Smith
and Jeff Reardon, but who is
going to pitch well enough to use
them besides Roger Clemens? The
New York Yankees are owned
by the meddling fool, George
Steinbrenner. Enough said. The
DetroitTigers are closer to getting
Social Security than winning the
AL East.

The Toronto Blue Jays are
solid from top to bottom. They
just have never had a manager
could orchestrate the
conﬂicting, personalities. Cito
Gaston stepped in last year and
tried a new style of managing:
Let’s be friends; it worked. George
Bell settled down and carried the
team to the pennant. What
worried the Blue Jays fans was
the way Fred McGriff went silent
in the stretch. He did not have an
extra base hit after Sept. 13. With
Jimmy Key and Dave Stieb leading
the pitching staff, the Jays could
actually run away with the

division. Some faces to watch

will be John Olerud, an early
entry for rookie of the year; Kelly
Gruber, continuing improvement
at third; and Mookie Wilson,
whose attitude got the team back
in the race. The only problem
with this team is that it should
have been blowing the rest of the
division away for the entire ‘80s,
but it didn’t. Maybe the ‘90s can
be a new time for theteam of the
‘80s to win.

The Baltimore Orioles were A

the surprise of ’89. Frank
Robinson, the manager, molded
a young team into believing it
could win. The Orioles behind
the leadership of shortstop Cal
Ripken Jr. should maintain that
attitude in 1990.Jeff Ballard, Bob
Milacki and 1989 Rookie of the
Year Gregg Olson are the anchors
of the pitching staff. Ben
McDonald, the college phenom
from LSU, will win the Rookie of
the Year this year if he stays
healthy. At 6-foot-7—inches,

McDonald will be an awesome
site some 60 feet from the plate.

In college, he struck out 373
batters in 308 innings. The
problem will lie in hitting. Mickey
Tettleton will have to hit like he

did last year (.258, 26, 65) to keep
the pressure off the youth in the

lineup. If Ripken can have a year
like he did the last time the O’s

were in the series, there is no

reason why they couldn’t end up

there again. Faces to watch will

be Ballard (Can he do it again no
matter who the first baseman
ends up being?) and Billy Ripken
(Can he get back to the form of
his rookie year?).

The Boston Red Sox have the
lore of Fenway on their side, just
like the Celtics and the Bruins are
with “the” Garden. Clemens will
have another Cy Young year,
Wade Boggs will hit a quiet .340,
and Mike Greenwell will continue
to be the unknown superstar he
is. The question for the BoSox is
whether there's enough pitching
after Clemens to win. Without a
trade of co—closer Smith, the staff
after Clemens is Mike Boddicker,
John Dopson, Eric Hetzel and
Wes Gardner. The bullpen will
be in great use, but the ace Jeff
Reardon may not get the
opportunities he needs to be
successful. It may take him a year
for’ him to get use to his new
surroundings. The faces to watch
will be’ Carlos Quintana at first,
Tony Pena behind the plate and

whoever they get for Smith, unless
he goes to the rotation. That
could prove to be interesting.
Milwaukee Brewers. They
have nine players coming off
surgery this season. If they all can
come back, the Brewers will be
there in the end. Lefty Teddy
Higuera is recovering from ankle
and back problems. He must get
back to form. The star of this staff,
now that Higuera is a question
mark, is Chris Bosio. Last year,
Bosio had a 2.95 ERA and 15
wins. Robin Yount and Paul
Molitor are the heart and soul of
this team. They can be counted
on again to lead the Brewers to at
least the .500 mark. Faces to
watch will be Dave Parker for

 

clubhouse leadership, Gary
Sheffield for his improving
attitude with the help of personal
coach Don Baylor, and Jim
Gantner for his ability to recover
from major knee surgery.

The Cleveland Indians are
going to try to last the whole
season in the pennant chase.
During the last few years, they
have made runs at it but never

had enough confidence or_

winning attitude to make it. Enter
Keith Hernandez, formerly of the
Mets. He knows how to win, and
he has proven that this attitude
affects his teammates. General
manager Hank Peters of the great
Oriole decline is trying to put

, together a solid organization with

that winning attitude. His new
manager is John McNamara, who
definitely knows what ittakes to
win. They made the big deal of
the off season by acquiring the
Hall of Fame rookie catcher Sandy
Alomar Jr. At least, everyone
thinks that Cooperstown should

» Blue Jays equipped to repeat in the weak AL East

make room in about 20 years.
Greg Swindell, T om Candiotti,
Bud Black and John Farrell put
together a capable staff along
with closer Doug Jones. Faces to
watch will be rookie third
baseman Carlos Baerga; newly
acquired Chris James, filling the
tradedJoe Carter’s big shoes; and
Joey Belle, for his ability to jump
to the majors from AA ball.

The New York Yankees are
led by Don Mattingly. He is the
source of pride that is the Yankees.
The killer for this great franchise
is pitching. In each of the last five
years, the Yankees havebeen in
first or second at the All—Star
break, only to falter at the end
because of the lack of pitching.
It’s no better this year. They have
called upon the lost one, Pascuel
Perez, to be their ace. Andy
Hawkins, Tim Leary, Dave LaPoint
and Clay Parker round out this
wonderﬁil pitching staff. Watch
for closer Dave Righetti to move

The Pitt lacrosse club recorded
two wins and a loss over the
weekend while hosting an
invitational tournament at Pitt
Stadium and South Stadium.

‘Pitt invited a number of‘ teams
to the games. Buffalo State,
Fredonia State, Denison College,
Washington and Jefferson, and
the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club were
among the teams which attended.

~ Pitt defeated Buffalo State 7-6

in overtime on Friday, lost to
Denison 7-4 on Saturday at South

, Stadium and beat Fredonia State

8-1 on Sunday. Pitt’s season record
is now 4-2.
The highlight of the weekend

. for the Pitt squad was its win on

Friday, said Pitt head coach Gary
Neft.

“It was a big, big win for us,"
said Neft. “They are a varsity
team. They are one of the best
teams we’ll play all year.”

Buffalo State plays in NCAA
Division III.

Lee Stember led Pitt on Friday
with two goals, and he also
assisted Eric Weber's game-
winning goal in sudden—death

I overtime. Weber also had a goal

in the second quarter, and T om
Keating added two goals.

Goalie Mike Shiner stopped a
Buffalo State rush in overtime,
allowing Pitt to counterattack and
win the game.

“We really came together in
overtime,” said Shiner. “We got a
free clear [after a Buffalo State

foul] and got the ball up the field
for the goal.”

Pitt played an inconsistent game
on Saturday against Denison.
They fell to a 4-0 deficit early and
came back in the second half, but
fell short.

“We were better than they
were,” said Shiner. “Our heads
just weren't there in the first half.”

“It was a little bit of a letdown,”
said Neft “We were due for a bad
game. We outplayed them for
three of the four quarters. We
must have hit nine [goal] posts.”

Pitt came back Sunday with the
blowout over Fredonia State; It
was no contest.

Pitt held the ball in the offensive
zone for almost the entire game.
It was a 60-minute offensive drill.

“We needed to get some

offense; we got some today," said
Neft.

Stember registered the hat trick,
and Weber scored two goals.

Stember finished the weekend
with six goals and one assist.
Weber had five goals and one
assist, and Harper Watters scored

one goal and four assists.

Pitt allowed only 14 goals in
the three games with Shiner in
goal.

Pitt’s next game is tonight
against rival Carnegie Mellon

consistently packed,

fighting each other to get a shot

are too numerous to mention.

Now I see why.

But what do you ask a 13-year-
old after a match? ESPN asked
about her strategy (“I don’t know,
I just hit hard and I can’t help it”),
how does it feel to beat one of the
world’s top players (“Good, I
guess”), and what she is looking
forward to in the future (“I'm
looking forward to playing”).

She answered with the
complete innocence and
bewilderment of a child and still
admits that she can’t understand
what all the fuss is over the
attention she has been getting.

What scares me is that this

If young lady probably still dabbles

in coloring books, hasn't kissed a

and hunk of the month Kirk
Cameron or whoever the hell is a
teen idol today, and isn’t near old

But she is emerging as the most

tennis will ever know, and she’s
proving it. -

This young lady is nowhere
near her physical or mental peak,
and she is making a laughing
stock out of some of the best
players in the world.
