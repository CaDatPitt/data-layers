Hutchins Claims
Rights Of Citizen
For College Staffs

Claims Way To Make Students
Radical Is To Suppress Them,
They React Negatively

‘Students Conservative’

Never referring (lirectly to the
'l‘urn.er ease, Dr. Robert Maynard
Hutch ins — 36-year-old president
of the l]7uivcrsit_v of Chicago, re-
garded as one of the leading edu-
cators in. the country--told The
Pitt News Monday evening that:

1—-A college professor “has the con-
stitutional right” to express any legal
opinion, even if that opinion is innu-
ical to certain groups.

2——A college profess()1' has the right
to criticize religion in a course taught
by him involving religion.

3—Any person ﬁt to teach a college
class has the right of "academic free-
dom.”

Completely captivating a packed
Carnegie music hall Community forum

Monday, the young college presi-
dent outlined his own theory
of advanced education, “crack-
ed down” on suppression of free

speech and declared that a person
does not lose his rights as a citizen
upon assuming his duties as profes-

' sor in a college.

Speaking rapidly, the six-foot, ath-
letic-looking president asserted that
no one but persons in the same ﬁeld
have the right to determine the com-
petency of any professor and that per-
manent tenure of oﬁice guarantees-
academic freedom. He said:

“If teachers are to be deprived of
their constitutional rights as citi-
zens, only spiritless drudges will
consent to remain in education.
One way to guarantee them these
rights is through permanent tenure.”

Students Dr. Hutchins charged, a.re
“nearly always conservative.” He
declared:

“There is only one way to make
students radical—-suppress them.

Tickets Distributed Tomorrow
In State Hall Arts Oﬁice

Tickets of admission to “Ballet
Mecanique” and “A Nous La
Li-berte” will be available tomorrow
and Friday afternoons, from 1 to 5
o’clock, in the fine arts ofﬁce, Room
109, State hall. Each student may ob-
tain two tickets.

The third series in the movie project
sponsored by the ﬁne arts department
will take place on May 8. The I-"rick
Training School auditorium, which
seats over 600, will house the movies.

“Ballet Meoanique” is a .French
silent pit.-t.ure, directed by Fernando
Leger, the cubist painter; “A l\'ous
La Liberte” is a French talkie, direct-
ed by Rene Clair, the outstanding
movie director of France. _

Rene Clair, one time member of the
“Avant Garde” group of artists, is a
director with a delightful sense of
humor, and a. keen feeling for the
Parisienne character. In “A Nous La
Liberte,” he makes a satirical com-
ment on the economic maladjust-
ments of thel industrialized world, ar-
riving at a delightful but Arcadian so-
lutio11. The ﬁlm is almost a musical
com-edy, with music, dialogue, and
action. ,

“Ballet Mecanique” is a purely ab-
stract set of mechanics with the
rhythms obtained from the use of
machine-made‘ kitchen-ware and hard-
ware. Fernando Leger, who is most
popular as an instructor of American

’artists in Paris, has expressed his

artistic credo thusly:

“I prefer a mediocre picture per-
fectly executed to a picture beauti-
ful in intention but not executed.
Nowadays a work of art must bear
comparison with any manufactured
object. The artistic picture is
false and out-of-date. Only the pic-
ture, which is an object, can sus-

~ tain that comparison and challenge

time.”

Leah Stark Fills
Fifth SFA Seat

Committee Recommends Recount
Of Hart, Spitz Tie Vote

Leah Stark, C, will be the ﬁfth sen-
ior woman representative in SFA, the
governing b0‘dy’s Executive committee
decided at 3. special meeting Monday
afternoon.

In the campus election !F'riday,
Elinor Brown, Ed, had polled more
votes than Miss Stark; but her name
had not been approved by the nomin-
ating committee and her support came
from “write—ins.”

Using the SFA Constitution as a
basis, the committee unanimously ac-
cepted the election of Miss Stark.

“According to the Constitution. of
the Student Faculty Association,
Article VI, Section 1.1) as amended, a
definite nominating procedure is pre-
scribed. Thisprocedure precludes the
acceptance of ._’any names written on
.tl1e.,..ba.1lct..-.as -‘..oif»icial ca.ndidat.es for.
election to the Association. There-
fore tlie Executive committee in ac
ceptance of this provision, announces
the election of Leah Stark as ﬁfth
senior woman representative of SFA.”

“The nominating committee,"’ said
Leonard Marks, C35, chairman of the
Executive group, “spent one week in
eliminating candidates from the orig-
inal group of 184 submitted. Without
reflecting on individuals, we feel that
this process should establish the eligi-
ble candidates. Otherwise our work
would be superﬂuous.”

In the case of J. Edgar Spitz and
Vlialter Hart, junior candidates who
tied for tenth place, the committee
recommended a recount. If the result
of the second count remains unchang-
ed, the body will turn the solution of
the tie to the incoming University As-

Old Razz Rag, Alias Tabloid

Journalism, Reappears

 

John. Holbrook, E34, was a good
student and a capable dance chair-
man, but students who respect tradi-
tion have him down opposite one
black mark.

Holbrook was chairman of the
Spring Festival dance last year—a
satisfying affair, many say-—and
cleared a. proﬁt, engaged a good band,
and had Bill Daufenbach collecting
tickets attired in a sailor suit. It was
lots of fun.

But Holb-rook neglected to incor-
porate a Razz Rag into his dance ar-
rangements. That was resented~——
especially by those who expected to
read their names in it.

Ellis H. Tumpson, BA36, this year’s
chief, has arranged a new shuffle, and
the traditional old Razz Rag is back
as a Festival dance feature. It will
be distributed some time during the
affair Saturday night at the Hotel

Schenley ballroom.

Freshmen and sophomores will be
unfamiliar with what the Razz Rag
connotes. It means that faculty, ad-
1lll‘;}lSi.l‘atl‘0I1, and the horde of “big
shots” frequenting Room 801, Cathe-
dral, and other haunts of their ilk, go
on the pan amid four pages of tabloid
journalism.

It’s free to dance patrons.

Says Tumpson, (before the free ad-
vertising could be deleted by the copy
desk), “Our affair is certainly and
surely you betcha worth the $2 we’re

charging. Consider: Austin Wylie’s
NBC orcl1e,str:1, centrally located
beautiful Hotel Sohenley ballroom,

dress optional, sports costume pre-
ferred, and what not. But if that
isn’t enough . .

“It’1l surely be worth two bucks to
read the private life, loves, and scan-
dal of Brother Marks of SFA!”

45 Features Arranged For Free
Show In Thaw Hall

Physics tyros at the huge exhibi-
tion in Thaw hall this Friday and
Saturday will have an opportunity to
do the following:

1———VVa.tch the path left by atoms
streaking through fog particles; 2--
count cosmic rays as they enter
Thaw hall after a journey of a. million
light years; 3——m.al<e liglit travel in
curves; 4-—-light, a lamp by means of
radio waves; 5——change the color of
objects with a twist of the hand; 6--
watch the action of strain on celluloid
through use of polarized light;
see objects that are not there and not
see objects which are there, proving
that the eye may often be quite wrong;

W. N, St. Peter, chairman of the ex-
hibit. Seven rooms will be used on
the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors in Thaw
hall for the exhibits.

Schools To Get

State Funds

While the University awaits the de-
cision of the Pennsylvania Assembly
concerning a biennial appropriation
of $1,100,000, the Michigan Legislature
assigns $3,700,000 to the University
of Michigan for its yearly appropri-
ation.

A similar condition exists in the
University of Minnesota, where the
State Legislature has increased the
a.pp1'opriation for the next year by
$300,000.

In addition to its large appropria-
tion to the State university, the
Michigan body voted $1,478,000 to
Michigan State college.

Political “Seer” Recalls Grand

By Igor

The campus political situation is
clouded nay overru.n—by splits. No
melon splits this time, for a change.
nor Druid plums, ODK peaches, or
what fruit do you favor? ‘

Party splits, faction break-ups, pres-
sure crack-downs monopolize the
orchard, to pursue a riigure to its
death.

The GOP, or Grand Old Party of
Alpha. coalition, once composed of
Delta Tau Delta, Pi Lainbda Phi, Psi
Omega, Phi Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha,
Phi Gamma Delta, and Kappa Sigma
just is no more.

The newer, and, at the time of last
year’S elections, more efficient Beta
<:oali.tion, up to now included -Sigma.
Alpha Epsilon, Phi Epsilon Pi, Theta
Chi, Phi Delta. Theta, Sigma Alpha
Mu, Lambda Chi. Alpha, and Sigma
Chi. They dumped the Alpha apple-
cart in lnterfraternity council, and
were themselves dumped by Univer-
sity administrators in the abandoning
of that body. Then they teamed with
an avid group of Independents to take
a majority in the new Student Faculty
Association General Assembly. S}?-‘A
this year was dominated by Beta-Inde
pendent me-n—but the ssociation
functioned on the merit system.

Now we are met on a great battle-

And the remains of four armies clut-
ter up the premises.

Alpha, imlications show, stumbles
along with the Dolls, Pi Laxns, and
Psi O’s.

Ed Durk.in’s Kappa Sigs are con-
sidered as the back-bone and moving
force of a nascent group—-the Gam-
mas—composed of four former Alpha
houses and two Beta bolters: Kappa
Sigs, Phi Kaps, Phi G-ams, Pi K A’s,

Delegates Adopt
Social Measures

 

Sterilization, State Ownership
Included In Reform Bills

The" second annual meeting of the
Intercollegiate conference on govern-
ment was held at l-larrisburg last
week-end.

The most co11t1'o,lve1'sial measures
considered by the body were the bill
providing for “sterilization. of the in-
sane and criminals,” where the Cath-
olic schools as 2:. whole strongly op-
posed such. a. proposal, and the bill
provicling for "the State ownership and
control of natural resources,” opposed
by the more conservative delegates,
who cl}-arged “socialism, communism
and other ’isn1s!” Both bills finally
passed by large majorities.

Some other bills considered, in-
cluded those providing for the aboli-
tion of coal and iron police; the set-
ting up of a social security commis-
sion for the administration of old age
pensions, unemployment and health
insurance; providing for home rule
and the city and county manager sys-
tems of local government; assuring
the right of labor to organize; aboli-
tion of the use of injunctions in labor
disputes; and the establishment of a
system of competency tests for all
qualiﬁed voters.

The convention was presided over
by John P. Bracken, C34, and Gene-
vieve Blatt, Law37.

Plans for next year indicate that
the conference will be a state conven-
tion for the consideration of national
platforms of political parties.

Alumnus Describes Recent

Modernization Of New Egypt

The followinlg letter is from Spurgeon Wuertenberger, C33, one of a

number of Pitt graduates in remote parts of the earth.

Wuertenberger

stepped from‘ the vice presidency of the Pitt YMCA into a teaching fel-
4 lowship at the American University in Cairo.——Ed. Note.

 

By Spurgeon B.

Wuertenberger

There are two angles from which one might look at the subject of

“Modernization In Egypt.”

The ﬁrst would be from a long period viewpoint.

which would trace the incoming of modernity over a period of several de-

cades.
Egypt is at the present time.

Or, secondly, one could look at it from a viewpoint of how “modern”
Obviously, of course, I am no more qualiﬁed
to discuss the ﬁrst of these now than if I had never come to Egypt.

The

second one, however, has been a. subject which has interested me from the

time I arrived, and will be the one:

I shall develop.

The city of Cairo, as an example of
the most modern part of Egypt, pre-
sents vivid contrasts between the past
with its seemingly immutable cus-
toms and the struggle of the contem-
porary generations to introduce a
“Western modernization program.”

Perhaps the best way in which one
can observe the advent of modernity
lies in the housing conditions a11d in
the building construction going on in

the city. There are many apartment
houses, newly built, which feature all
of the modern conveniences. The ac-
tual construction of these buildings
however, is different from that at
home.

They are not steel structures but
concrete and brick and are limited to
seven or eight stories. Instead of the
incessant cha.ttering of a rivet ham-
mer, one hears the chanting of Egyp-

Cap and Gown Lady

The Cap and Gown club just couldn’t
get along without its only woman
member.

But it wouldn’t even want to try,
for after 10 years of work with stu-
dents, Mrs. Mame J. Algeo, who has
just arrived from Toledo to take over
costume designing, has become a. vital
part of the annual show.

“They're the best boys in the
world,” Mrs. Algeo says about Cap
and Gown members, “but I wouldn't
know what to do, though, if some-
day just before the curtain the)’
should all have their dresses and
hats and stockings on exactly as
they should."

Mre. Algeo today is working at

tumes ready by Monday when "In
the Soup” opens for a week’s run at
the Nixon Theater.

The toughest part of the entire per-
formance, the little gray-haired lady
admits, is keeping the “chorus girls”
supplied with heels for their shoes.

“They kick so hard,” Mrs. Algeo
sighs, “It's just impossible to keep
the heels on for some of them.
The shoes are always small, the
boys say, and they can't get used
to them. Between acts they always
have to take them off.”

Mrs. Algeo thinks “The Red Moon,”
presented in 1926, gave her the most
enjoyment because of the adventures
encountered on the road tour. New
Castle, Youngstown, Altoona, Union-
town and other cities were visited.

After the performance in Uniontown
the boys tried to bring a. railroad car
into _ the hotel. .

Coming home from Youngstown they
succeed:-‘d in hoisting a. te1eg‘aph
pole into the Pullman.

No matter where the performance,
wigs, garters and even dresses were
always being misplaced. Often a
dress strap would snap during a
slaiice number, necessitating quick
salvation from the wings.

But that is why Mrs. Algeo looks
forward to her stay at Pitt every year.

She first took over costuming in
1925 for "Castles in Spain,” one of
the most elaborate shows ever pro-
duced on campus.

Mrs. Algeo had designed a dress for
her grandd,a.ugl1ter who wore it to a Cap
and Gown.show_ Mrs. Gus Schnabel.
wife of the present musical director of
(tap and Gown, saw the dress and was
so struck by its be 1.uty that she imme-
diately asked Mrs. Algeo to take over
the costuming for the next production.

truly an unusual circumstance.

No Beta man was elected as such.

l\_‘ow for the outlook: Durkin, whose
;_.arty is given a slight edge by fore-
casters, already has been elected lu-
‘§.e,:i‘i’ratei‘11ity Council president. It is
(claimed that Joseph L. Rodgers.
BA35, is slated on the Gamma ticket
fﬁl’ SFA chairman, while William
Harvey, C35, is up for old Alpha. But
since Rodgers is varsity football co-
manager and presideiit of his frater-
nity, it’s doubtful if he’ll risk excess
activity points by running.

VVhether the’ Independents will back
a member of their own group against
almost impossible odds or play a
buffer game between the two former
associated groups, is unknown. By
unknown is not meant that the news
is unavailable-—they just don't know
themselves. ‘

Among the upsets, those for senior
assemblyman are most outstanding.
Charles Herald, C, member of the

The Hideous Slums Of Cairo Depicted
By Instructor At American University

tian workmen as they trudge up and
down wooden inclines with their bas-
kets of stone or cement or scrap on
their backs.

One workman is usually designated
as the leader of the chant. He sings
out the song b_v phrases and the other
workmen repeat after him in chorus.
I still remember one sunset not long
ago when the chanting of the work-
men excavating the temple of the
Sphinx made the whole desert seem
unreal and very ancient. Their fore-
fathers. some thousands of years ago,
probably chanted in just such a way
as they heaved at the building blocks
of the Pharaohs.

In contrast to these modern apart-
ment houses and their equivalents
among the homes of the wealthy are
the “homes” of the poorer classes in
that section of the city known rather
loosely as “Old Cairo.”

Here some seven hundred thousand
natives live in an unbelievably small
area and in an unbelievable collection
of ﬁlth and trash. Goats, children,
hens, pigeons, calves and sheep all
vie for the choicest spots in the “liv-
ing” room. 'Water is carried several
blocks on the heads of teen-age girls
(the most desired container is a five-
gallon Shell oil can!).

The streets in these quarters are in
just the condition you would expect
when the. street cleaning force cou-
ﬁnes its efforts to the paved streets
of the “1iew" city, plus the effect of
using the streets for what would be
in the Occideiit, private affairs! If is
very difficult to pI'0pe1'l_v describe
these conditions for it is hard for one
to believe the things one sees. How-
ever, it is comforti_ng to realize that,
on the whole, those changes that are
made, and that rebuilding that is
done, tend to replace these mud: huts
with houses that are, at least, more
“liable” to sanitation and more con-
ducive to the pride of ownership.

I11 a.tt.itudc and outlook young
Egypt is already modern. Sometimes.
their ardent nationalism clouds the
situation, but on the whole they are
driving ahead for a. cleaner and bet-
ter nianaged country. Each year the
number of foreign trained Egyptian
professional men is increasing and
each year their effect on the nation is
being increasingly felt.

True, the native Egyptian has cer-
tain characteristics which seem to
the \Veste-rner to be permanent ban-
dicaps, but they are not hopeless han-
dicaps even at that.

The first three months that one is

in the country, one marvels at the
capacity of the average Egyptian for
loaﬁng. After one has been here for
3. while one wonders how some of
them accomplish as much as they do.

VVit.h something like seventy per
cent of the native population blind or
almost blind, and an even larger per-
centage afflicted with the disease
“Bilharzia” (which in the adult hav-
ing the fully developed disease causes
the loss of about a pint of blood a
day) it is little wonder that their ef-
ficiency is. impaired.

Progress is definitely in evidence
however. Scientiﬁc treatment of dis-
ease is gradually coming to be con-
sidered as something not necessary
associated with prosyletism and the
intelligent use of modern civiliza-
tion's beneﬁts is COllllll_9,‘ more and
more to be a realized fact.

VVhetliei- or not the Egyptian will
eventually modernize all of his orien-
tal outlook is still an open question.
but since the desirability of such a
condition is also an open question,
the matter need not. be one of pertur-
bation in University circles.

Hutchins Speaks
On College Rights

(Continued From Page One.)
lVilliam Graliaiu Sumner taught
free trade for 40 years at Yale and
nearly every student completed his
course an avowed protectionist.

“Most student Reds are manu-
factured by the schools. Few of
them know what Red means and
fewer are willing to defend their,
rights‘ until those” rights are sup-'
pressed.”

Dr. Hutchins drily deﬁned a uni-
versity as an institution that “does
everything and will do it for any-
body.”

He admitted that he did not go so
far as one educator who “would con-
fer a bachelor’s degree on every
American citizen at birth.”

He told the forum “there are many
professors I dislike intensely in Chi-
cago and more so because they dared
criticize n1e in public. But,” he add-
ed, “I should never think of depriving
them of the right to state their opin-
ions.”

Dr. Hutchins held his own in the
free discussion that followed. Some
of the questions and answers follow:

Q. VVhat is the standing of the

 

American Association of University
Professors? .
A. I don't believe I understand the

animus behind that question, there-
fore I shall not answer it.

Q. Should a professor have the
right to teach a philosophy destruc-
tive to the existing political system?

A. No.

Q. Why are professors opposed to
cooperation with organized labor?

A. Professors are rugged individ-
ualists.

Q. Should professors be allowed
to endorse strikes?

A. Professors are 5-citizens.

Q. What are universities doing
about re.habilitat.ion of young crim-
inals?

A. Some people believe students
are of that class.

Dr. Ben C}. Graham, Superintendent
of Pittsburgh schools, introduced the
speaker. Recently radical speakers
were barred from public schools.

Q. Vvliat do you think of the ac-
tion of the Pittsburgh Board, of
Education in suppressing the freedom
of speech and yet cooperating with
the Community forum? ,

A. I’d call it cooperation.

Varsity, Freshman Teams Meet
West Virginia. Mountaineers
In Stadium Saturday

High school athletes from district
sc-holastic institutions will» converge
in the stadium on Saturday morning
mid J.fteI‘l_l00ll' for the‘ running of the
28th annual interscholastic track and
ﬁeld meet. In conjunction with this
event, Coach Carl Olson's varsity and
fresliman track teams will meet Vlfest
Virginia.

‘sVhile at the presenttime only six
schools have sent in entry lists, it is
expected that 700 track performers will
compete. Scott high, winner of last
year’s event, will be back to defend its
title.

Thus far, Ambridge, East Hunting-
don Township, Canonsburg, Connells-
ville, Uniontown and Trinity are the
only teams to send in their represen-
tative list.

Preliminary events will be held
througliout the morning. All ‘ﬁnal
events will be run off in the afternoon.

The Panther varsity will be seeking
its second straight win of the season
against the strong Mountaineer out=ﬁt.
The Vvest Virginia boys, remembering
last year's 95-40 defeat at the hands
of the Pitt squad and also the shel-
lacking they took in their indoor re-
lay meet last winter, will be just as
anxious to even up old scores.

In Woodford, the Mountaineers will
present one of the districts leading
sprinters. He won both dashes in last
year’s duel and will be trying to re-
peat on Saturday. Gedwilas and Mc-
Intyre are two other gentlemen who
xx ill bear watching on the part of the
Panthers. Gedwilas‘ recently broke
the Mountaineer indoor mile record,
running that. distance in 4 minutes, 27
seconds. McIntyre is a quarter-miler
who should give Kiger and Connelly
a battle for honors.

Panther freshmen will be out to re-
peat last year’s win over their year-
ling opponents. Last year the locals
defeated the Mountaineer frosh by a.
80-57 score.

The Panther varsity made one of
the best showings ever made by a
district school in the Penn Relays last
Friday and Saturday. The.mile-re-
lay team won the Class B title for
the third year in a row, and after a
half-hour rest came back to take a
fourth in the Class A run. Fleming
finished third in the 100-meter dash;
Taano broke the present school record
in the javelin, throwing the stick 204
feet, 2 5-8 inches. He won a second
in this event. The distance‘ relay
team garnered a ﬁfth place, the sprint
medley quartet got a third, and the
distance medley outﬁt was able to
take a third.

non-fraternity men are more than
welcmne to enter the events on the
program.

The independent men must, of
course, beat out the Greek tracknlen
in the individual events to be eligible
for awards. Fraternity men will be
competing for only the first and sec-
ond place tezun trophies.

Martin J. Feely, director of Intra-
llllll‘-‘II athletics, is anxious to have a
great number of non-fraternity men
get. into the meet, and he is not
averse to passing out any number oi?
medals to those boys who win the
events.

man eligible to enter the competition.
In previous years‘ the interfrat‘er-
nity track meet has been one of the
most. hotly-contested affairs on the
Greek calendar. The addition of non-
fraternity competition to the ﬁeld
should make the afternoon all the
more interesting for "those houses
seeking to add one more cup to the
well-polished mantle.

afternoon after 2:30 o'clock,

There will be competition in eight
weight classes. The divisions are;
115, 125, 135, 145, 155, 165, 175, and
heavyweight. Inasmuch as no mem-
ber of the varsity- or freshman teams
is allowed to compete in the tourna-
ment, every student entered, regard-
less of past experience, stands an
equal chance to win a championship
or runner-up medal.

Final matches in all weight classes
will take place in the stadium Friday
Lvening. Preliminary matches will
start on Monday in Trees gymnasium
and will be completed on Thursday.

Women of the University will go
athletic tomorrow afternoon in play
suits, shorts, and split skirts as they
compete in the women’s sports events
at the stadium, the second day of the
gala Spring Festival week.

Events will begin for the feminine
contingent at 2:30 o’clock, when two
mushball games will be played with 12
women representing each of the four
classes. The ﬁnal game will be be-
tween the winners of the first bracket,
and will be run off at 4:30 o’clock.

According to Frances Dent, Edi-‘.5,
co-chairman with lVIario1L Epping,
BA35, anything goes in the matter of
dress, all that is necessary being ﬂat
heels and class spirit. Entrants will
be under the wings of the class chair-
men who will see that they fall into
the right events.

Any.woman may enter for the events
by ﬁlling out the entry blank and leav-
ing it at the desk in Heinz House or
giving it to any‘ class chairma.n or
member of the coznmittee. The class
chairmen are Frances McLaughlin,
C35; Jane Booth, Ed36; Mary Jane
Morgan, 37; and Janet Hallock, C38.

It will be a busy afternoon for the
women, with badminton, jacks, hop-
scotch, darts, bean bags, deck tennis.
baseball throws, basketball throws,
handicap races, and volleyball all go-
ing at once, in the hour between the
mushball events. Although 20 women
must. be deﬁnitely signed for the hand-

Mushbal1Garnes Open Annual Playday In Stadium;
Cup,,Will Be Awarded To Group With Highest Score

 

icap races, to be divided into ten nov-
elty (lashes, and eight must be signed
for the volleyball games, every con-
testant is for herself in the‘ other
games.

Every point rolled up by any one
woman who has challenged another
to a game of darts, or bean bags, or
jacks, will be counted on her class
score, but otherwise she will be in-
dependent and may challenge as many
women in as many events as she
chooses.

“The, class having most women en.-
iered naturally has the best chances
for piling up the most class p0ini‘s,"
Miss Dent said. There will be of-
flCl3lS posted at the various places
where the games are to be played who
will record the scores as they are
made. A cup will be awarded the class
totaling the most points for the after-
noon’s play, and another cup to the
class team winning the mushball
tournament, These cups will probably
be awarded Varsity night, Miss Dent
said.

Wonien representing their classes
will be known by colored “pin11ies,”
which are sleeveless, buttonless adap-
tations of the English pinafore.

Working with Miss Epping and Miss
Dent on the committee are Audrey
Graham, Ed37; Jane Booth, Ed36;
Annetta Vvardley, Ed35; and Mary
Jane Morgan, Ed37. WAA is in charge-
of equipment and arrangements.

The 1935 Owl will appear on the
campus Friday.

According to Jules Green, BA35,
business manager, there will be a
limited number of copies. Starting

I am a friend indeed. A better friend than
others, because I am made only of mild, fra-

a single sharp top leaf nor a single coarse bot-
tom leaf to mar my good taste or m.y uniform
inildness. I do not irritate. To loneliness l

bring companionship. I am the best of friends.
