Po svar,
AAU look
for ROTC

solution

By Jennifer Calabrese
Senior Staﬂ‘ Writer

. University administrators have
repeatedly said they can do
nothing about ROTC
discrimination because the Pitt
program is only following
Department of Defense policy.

Now, Pitt President Wesley
Posvar has gone to the root of
the problem.

Posvar participated in an effort
by the American Association of

Universities to try to end
discrimination against
homosexuals in the Reserve

Officers Training Corps by
swaying the national policy
makers. Posvar has long
maintained that he opposes the
discrimination in the ROTC, but
has been reluctant to take action
against Pitt’s ROTC program.

“ROTC discrimination is a
national problem and should be
dealt with on a national level.
Universities need to stand
together and since this is a matter
of public policy we ought to deal
with it at the level where
something can be done about it,”
Posvar said.

Members of the AAU proposed
sending a letter to the Secretary
of Defense informing him of the
conﬂict between the sexual anti-
discrimination policies of most of
the AAU members and the
exclusion of homosexuals by the
ROTC, a policy that is mandated
by the Department of Defense.
Though some university
presidents at the meeting were
against sending the letter because
they did not want to be involved
in political matters, Posvar said
that he strongly argued in favor
of the communication.

“I told them that this was above
politics; this is a matter of social
justice,” he said.

The proposal for the letter
passed about 3:1 at the AAU
meeting, according to Posvar. The
correspondence, which is set to
be sent over the summer, will
request a meeting between the
Secretary of Defense and the
president of the AAU to discuss
the matter.

Posvar reported these events
to last weeks meeting of the
University Senate Council, and
repeated his opposition to taking
any action against Pitt’s ROTC
program.

John Benedict uses his talents to commemorate AIDS victims at Sunday‘s vigil.

Candle in the wind...
250 participate in Pittsburgh AIDS Vigil

By Robyn Smigel
For the Pitt News

A candlelight AIDS vigil drew over 250 supporters
Downtown to the Trinity Cathedral on Sunday
night to commemorate victims of the disease.

The sympathizers hoped to raise consciousness
within the community and centered the event
around the theme of remembrance, hope and
action. The Pittsburgh event was part of a
worldwide day of recognition, including an AIDS
Walk in New York City and vigils in countries such

A as South Africa.

“There are people living with AIDS and dying
with AIDS. We want to come together as a
community as a symbol of hope to those whose
lives have been touched by AIDS,” said Marian
Landau, a volunteer with the Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force.

Bob Brooks, the program coordinator, said the
vigi1’s purpose was to “raise awareness and create
consciousness, to remember those [with AIDS]
and the price they paid.”

Events included songs, poems and readings to
“characterize people who struggle with the effects
of the disease.”

John Holt, who performed for the crowd, said
“anything that's done in a positive format is a help,
definitely. The fact that people get up and share
their talent to help a cause is important."

Although itwas a public event, many individuals
did not want to be identified, due to the sensitive
nature of the issue. One participant explained,
“It's a shame that society can't accept the reality of
the situation — that AIDS is a real and deadly

disease  and this denial forces many to

ignore the importance of tonight's vigi1.” A
The central theme was prevalent in the

music, poetry and‘ personal reflections of the

.. performers. John Benedict sang about the

Names Quilt and said that when the song was
originally written, “there were only 2,170
people affected; since then the song had to be
altered, slightly  tragically.”

The program then moved on to supporters
reading poems written for or concerning the
theme. Ted Hoover read a poem by Melvin
Dixon called “Heartbeats,” a chronicle of one

-man’s struggle during the progress of the

disease.

Other speakers included members of the
religious community who work with AIDS
victims. One minister read a statement for
Brad Gardner, a person who was unable to be
present because he was hospitalized due to
complications from AIDS. His message stressed
that he was “continually surprised by AIDS 
not by its horror ‘stories but by its touching
tales of courage, beauty and love.”

Linda Carola, along with Holt, performed an
original composition called “No More Running.”
This message stressed that the supporters and
victims “refused to be abused in this society.”

The vigil ended with a prayer read by Denny
Riggs and Pam Vingle followed by three
minutes of silence. The event was sponsored
by the Allegheny Health Department, the Pitt
Men’s Study, the Shepherd Wellness
Community, the Hemophilia Center and the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force. ‘

Memorial
SK honors
former
student

By Jennifer Milan
For Tbe Pitt News

Friends and classmates of a  .

former University of Pittsburgh
student have organized a 5K run
as a memorial tribute to her.
Colby Fike was a University of
Pittsburgh physical therapy

student. On Dec. 28, 1989, she

died in a car accident in Somerset,
Pa. The race in her memory will
be held in Schenley Park on
Sunday, May 27.

“Colby was well-liked, so full
of life  it was a hard thing to
deal with,” admits Tess DePao1i,
her classmate and roommate.

Jessica Fike, Colby’s mother,
set up a memorial fund at the
farnily’s Lutheran church in

, Somerset, hoping to one day

raise enough money to name a
physical therapy department after
her daughter.

When Fike’s classmates learned
of this, they thought it was a
wonderful idea and a fitting
tribute.

“She worked so hard while she
was in school. We could see how
dedicated she would be," said
another classmate, Lori Pizzica.

The only roadblock to the
project was raising the money.

“We were on our way to Seven
Springs for her funeral and we
were trying to figure ways to
raise money,” said Amy Jo
Wilkinson. The idea of having a
race in Colby’s memory was
brought up and it sounded like it
might work.

“Colby did run,” Wilkinson
said. “We thought it would be
something she’d like.” i

The race proposal was brought
up at a class officers’ meeting
and work on the project started
immediately.

Everybody in the class, even
those who did not know Fike
well, helped out, including
physical therapy department staff
members.

“We all wanted to do what we
could to make the dream come
true,” said DePaoli. “Her parents
are really thrilled and excited.”

“If not for us, then for her
parents, I want to see a great
turnout,” said Pizzica.

A dollar goal has not been set;
the class just wants to make as
much money as possible.
According to Pizzica, registration
is going well.

A near—confrontation between

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, May 23, 1990

By Jennifer Calabrese
Senior Stajf Writer

When Pitt’s administration
called assistant athletic director
Bob Heddleston’s forgery on a
$300 check a “relatively minor”
incident, faculty members had
some questions.

“Isn’t forgery a felony?” asked
linguistics professor Sarah
T homason at last week’s
meeting of the University Senate

Council.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
responded, “Well, forgery is a
felony, I guess, but I don’t know
what constitutes a felony as a
matter of fact.”

Posvar was reporting to the
Senate Council on the recent
controversy publicized in the
local media about the
mishandling of funds by
Heddleston. According to
Posvar, Heddleston forged an
endorsement on a $300 check
which was payment for a
performance at Station Square
by Pitt’s cheerleaders.
Hedleston was also unable to
explain $2000 in cash

contributions that were missing

Posvar told the Senate Council
that the incident had been

from the Golden Panther office. _,

FAS questions athletic scandal

blown out of proportion.
“The media, .I think, were
very unfair and exaggerated or
misrepresented the situation in
this respect. [There] was a
check for $300, which was
relatively minor, which was
dealt with over a period of
several months with a
reprimand. and a» restitution;

‘but in“ parallel there [were]

discovered other instances of
suspected mishandling of
funds, which [were] much more
serious, and it is those parallel
considerations that led to Mr.
Heddleston’s resignation,”
Posvar said. “And the timing of
the old issue about the $300
check . and the current
investigation of the mishandled
funds was completely
confused.”

Both Posvar and Executive
Vice President Jack Freeman
told the council that they did
not consider the first incident
to be sufficient reason to fire
Heddleston.

“This was a very ambiguous,
complicated situation involving
several people and

conversations late at night. It

was felt it was a culpable act,
[but] it was felt that simple act
was not considered sufficient

‘records pertaining to

unto itself to terminate
someone’s whole career as long
as redemption was made,”
Posvar said. '

Records are now being
audited to establish whether
there are any further missing
funds, a process which Posvar
said is nearly completed.

Though Posvar criticized the
local media and joked that their
misinformation and confusion
had “something to do with it
being early in the baseball
season,” Professor Nathan
Hershey pointed to a fault in the
administration’s handling of the
situation.

“I think that one of the
elements that got a lot of
attention in the media had to do
with the question of whether
the university is forthcoming
with regard to providing
information that is being sought.
I see that as more of a serious
problem,” Hershey said.

The Senate Council requested ,
that the Senate Athletic
Committee have access to the
the
Heddleston situation so that they
could also take part in the
investigation. I

ROTC

Continued from page 1

“Local controversy or even local
difficulties that would impose
penalties upon our own students
who are members of ROTC would
not be helpful and we want to
change things where it counts, at
the national level,” he said.

But one member of the Senate
Council, Professor Michael
Margolis, called for an individual
letter from Pitt to be sent to the
Secretary of Defense. F

“Carnegie Mellon University has
already been able to send a note
on its own indicating to the
Department of Defense that
discrimination is against their anti-
discrimination policy.
Washington University and
numerous others as well have

. done the same. It would seem

that this would not be a very
difficult task for us to undertake,
it is merely a statement of fact and
I think that we should get going
on this rather quickly,” Margolis
said.

The Senate Council decided to
form a committee to evaluate the
ROTC’s role at Pitt at a previous
meeting where faculty questioned
the right of the ROTC to violate
Pitt’s anti-discrimination policy

~ which includes sexual orientation.

The committee, which will
include student and faculty
members, has not yet been
formed. Student Government
Board President Julie Shepard
expressed concern about the
purpose of the committee. .

“I personally do not feel that
this should be a committee that
manages to go about the issue
avoiding it... it should come to

some sort of resolution in a very .0

timely fashion,” she said.

Posvar said that he thinks the
Department of Defense policy
will be changed within a few
years. And Military Science
Professor Captain Raymond
Horoho, who has maintained that
the exclusion of homosexuals
from the DOD is beyond the
control of Pitt’s ROTC program,
said that if the DOD changes its
policy Pitt’s ROTC will have to go
along with it. I

“If the DOD says its OK, its OK
with us. If the DOD changes its
policy, we are pawns; we will do
what they say,” he said.

Bundy predicts 40-year peace for U.S.—U.S.S.R. Fike

By Mark Smith
Staff Writer

Last Tuesday, a crowd of 300
ﬁlled David Lawrence auditorium
to hear McGeorge Bundy, former
national security adviser to the
Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, deliver the
SecondAnnualRidgeway lecture.

Bundy’s speech, “From Cold

. War to a Trusting Peace,” was

presented by the American
Experience Program and the
university’s Matthew B. Ridgeway
Center for International Studies,
and was sponsored by the

Chamber Development Co.

Bundy said we must “rethink”
our relationship with the Soviet
Union and Europe. In relation to
the Soviet Union, Moscow and
Washington agree that a nuclear
war cannot be won. Bundy
described the situation as a “stable
strategic stalemate.” With a
nuclear stalemate between the
super powers and the liberation
of Europe, Bundy predicted no
conﬂict between East and West
“for 40 years."

Bundy emphasized that
German reunification is an
important priority of the United

States’ re-evaluation of its
European relations. He described
Germany as America’s “most
important friend" in Europe.

Bundy claimed that there is no
evidence to support growing
nationalism or anti-Semitism in
the merging Germanys. Limitation
on German forces, maintaining
post-WWII borders and no
German nuclear weapons should
be conditions for reuniﬁcations,
according to Bundy. He also
stressed ‘renewing the new
Germany's membership with
NATO.

For the upcoming summit,

Bundy described the relationship
between Presidents Bush and
Gorbachev as a good, “working”
relationship. Also concerning the
Soviets, Gorbachev’s internal
crisis in the Soviet Union allowed
Bundy to comment: “[It’s] better
for us for him [Gorbachev] to
succeed.”

During an open—question
period, Bundy was asked what
we can do for Gorbachev. Bundy
recalled that the Soviet Union still
subsidizes Cuba and interests in
conﬂict with U.S. policy. He
suggested the U.S. government
cut back its defense spending.

lives up to responsibilities

_ . After all, “Why do-we have a university to begin with?”

Cheers to Student Government Board President Julie
Shepard for this statement and for her willingness to
confrontthe administration on behalf of Pitt students.

During the University Senate Council meeting on April
16, President Wesley Posvar maintained that action should
not be taken by Pitt against the Reserve Officers Training
Corps. His rationale was that the ROTC discrimination
policy needs a national solution. -

Shepard told the Council that she did not agree with

"Posvar’s View and cited several universities that had

removed the ROTC program from campus because of this
paradox. , V ‘ ‘

“How can we advocate this if it‘ is not in conjunction with
our anti-discrimination policy?” she asked.

Shepard criticized Posvar’s lack of action, asking him,
“Would you be interested at all in at least starting some
sort of discussion or movement about this  or being a
leader?’’ a J 0 .

Similarly, at a May 14 meeting, University Senate members
were discussing the Budget Policies Committee resolu-
tion to give faculty performing at a satisfactory level a raise
at least equal to the cost‘ of living. Shepard raised the
question of how a satisfactory teaching performance is
judged and the gross lack of student participation in this
process. .

Budget Policies Committee Chairman Donald H.

-McBurney said the university policy is to present faculty

with an annual letter of evaluation from their respective
department chairs. , '

“There is no student evaluation. involved?” Shepard
asked.

In the face of an administration that is out of touch with
the students, Shepard should be lauded for giving Pitt
students the representation they: deserve.

So, Whose ﬂag is it anyway?

Freedom of speech is an issue
that rears its media-hungry head
as regularly as election-year polls.
This year, issues concerning ﬂag
burning, censorship of the arts
and record labeling are predomi-
nant.

Sen. Jesse Helms’ attack on the
National Endowment of the Arts
and the issue of record labeling
have been featured heavily in
both the courts and the popular
press. Recently in the news, rec-
ord companies are now “volun-

tarily” labeling their records. The
labels that warn merely of ex-
plicit lyrics , are a scaled—down
model of the proposed neon-

yellow label listing the types of l
behavior mentioned in the al-_

bum.
As dictated by Helms, artists
now have to sign a sort of prom-

issory note not to be obscene .

when they apply for NBA fund-
ing. Most recently, the Supreme
Court has heard arguments con-
cerning last year’s Supreme Court
ruling that the Texas law banning
flag desecration was unconstitu-
tional. Congress is ready to amend
the Constitution banning flag
burning if the Supreme Court lets
its previous ruling stand. .
These issues go beyond the
rallying cry of censorship. What
proponents of these restrictive
acts are saying is that the motiva-
tion behind flag burning, graphic
art and record lyrics is equally

despicable and irrelevant.

The ﬂag—burning law in Texas
is considered “content neutral,”
meaning that ﬂag burning will be
illegal no matter what the reason
for the willful desecration. This
reasoning strikes me as being
disingenuous at the very least.

  "Lisa
Oshop  

It is people who are disenfran-
chised from the American system
who are out there setting Old
Glory on fire. The defendants‘
from the ﬂag—burning trial in the
South -were feminists, Native
Americans, African Americans,
artists and other minorities. His-
torically, these groups have been‘
denied individual protection as
set forth in the Bill of Rights;
consequently, our ﬂag, asymbol
of freedom and equality, is not
“their” ﬂag.

Robert Mapplethorpe, the art-
ist whose work has come under
fire by Helms and other conser-
vative leaders, was openly gay.
Much of his work, including the
six controversial pictures that
were part of his 42-picture ex-
hibit, commented upon the atti-
tudes, desires and behaviors of
both the gay and straight com-

munities.

2 Live Crew’s album “As Nasty
As They Wanna Be” was banned
from store shelves in Florida for
being “extremely explicit and
degrading to the female sex.” Yet
the band Guns ‘n’ Roses’ lyrics

are unashamedly violent and-

degrading toward women, as

well as gays and minorities, and ‘ I
the outcry that their music pro- ’

vokes from civil— rights groups

goes unnoticed from the politi_- pl

cal powers that be. V

Like Mapplethorpe’s photos, A
the purpose of 2 Live Crew’s .
. music is “to make people think

and reﬂect the kind of talk that
occurs in [2 Live Crew’s] commu-
nity.” J « ‘

Perhaps it is because 2 Live
Crew’s members are minorities
and Guns ‘n’ Roses’ members are
white that the former is banned

while the latter is celebrated, in

Florida and elsewhere.

The difference is the accep-
tance of people from beyond the
mainstream, legitimizes their

experiences and questions the

system that favors the straight,

white, middle-class male.
Perhaps the people. begging

for. restrictions on free gpeech

should take care that they don't I

wrap the flag so tightly around
themselves that they can no longer
breathe. T

Location resurfaces in PSU’s Big Ten admission  

‘By Mike Rampa

Sports Editor

Penn State University’s pro-
jected admission to the Big Ten
-Conference has recently stalled
in an apparently smooth
acceptance process, as the
presidents of the Big Ten are
now saying that their invitation to
PSU last winter was one “in
principle” only and subject to
further review.

Aside from the classic revenue
considerations of bringing
another school into the
conference, a major detriment to
PSU’s admission that hasreceived
much media attention since the
conception of the idea is the

“distance barrier which most of
the midwestern schools will have .

to overcome in traveling to State
College, Pa. ’
Granted, the mileage from some
of the Big Ten cities to State
College is quite a trek. The most
controversy comes from the
present Big Ten non—revenue
sports (those other than football
and basketball), because they
usually travel by van or bus. But
according to sources at Penn State
and certain schools in the Big
Ten, the distance argument is a

S minor one.

“I think everybody makes more

of [the distance] than there is to
it,” said Budd Thalman, sports-
information director at Penn State.

“I don’t think it’s difficult to get
to State College; it may be in the
center of Pennsylvania, but there
is an airport here and a bus
terminal and highways. So it can’t
be any more difﬁcult than what
goes on in the Pac—10, where
people travel from Los Angeles
to Washington. To me, it’s not
really a signiﬁcant argument at
all,” Thalman said.

Mike Pearson, sports-
information director I at the
University of Illinois, does not
see a problem with the revenue
sports and travel arrangements;

. after all, they usually charter ﬂights

everywhere anyway.

“The financial situation with
the non—revenue sports seems to
be the biggest stumbling block in
the whole plan. You’ve got two
situations where there will be
charter ﬂights, football and
basketball. Everything elseis on

a lesser scale,” he said. As a '

result, members of minor sports
teams may not be too keen on
driving upward of 600 miles into
central Pennsylvania.

Like businesses, many
universities are guided by the
proﬁt motive and obviously must
consider the revenues ans”

expenses associated with the
inception of any new program.
Al Fish, finance officer at the
University of Wisconsin, offered
an economic viewiof the travel
situation and what it means to the
university.

“For most of us on the western
end of the conference, it would
cause a difference in how we
schedule our meets. But we play‘
a lot of national competition as it
is now; our baseball team goes to
Florida, Arizona and California;
we go where the competition is.
And our feeling is that our cost
may be marginally more
expensive including Penn State
in the Big Ten, but not to the
extent t_hat it would cause us to
think itwas a reason to not include
them,” Fish said. A '

Fish echoed the standard
complaints of the non-revenue
sports, and added that football
teams who have a hard time
chartering ﬂights into central
Pennsylvania are prone to
experience the most angst by
adding PSU to the conference.

“I think the argument mostly
comes from football teams who
have a hard time ﬂying charter
airplanes and landing in State
College. To a large extent, most
of the teams in the Big Ten aren"t

The Pitt News ' first round picks  

for the upcoming 1990 NBA draft

, Here’s the the draft order of
the June 27 two-round ordeal,
and an (un) educated guess at
the picks of each team
represented.

1. NeWJersey— the Nets ﬁnally
earned the dubious honor of the
first choice —-A “Our guys worked
real hard to get this pick this
year,” Reed said -— so it is
imperative that they use it wisely.
But where to start? Sam Bowie
finally played a full year, and
Mookie Blaylock was a very
pleasant surprise at the point.
Dennis Hopson and Roy Hinson
are middling at best, although
they have their occasional
outbursts of athleticism. Chris
Morris, after a wonderful rookie
year, encountered the
sophomore jinx. The Nets need
help at forward and at shooting
guard. And despite the talents of
one Derrick Coleman, the
concensus number one pick, the
Nets would be hard-pressed to
pass up high—scoring swingman
Dennis Scott of Georgia Tech.
Otherwise, look for the Nets to
orchestrate a deal for an
established player and a future
draft choice.

2. Seattle — Oh, if only Dana
Barros was six inches taller. In
Nate McMillan, the Sonics have a
great passer and defender at the
point, but he provides little in the
way of scoring. Sedale Threatt is
an adequate backup, but not a

starter. And though Michael Cage
will get his rebounds wherever
he plays, he is a forward, not a
center, which is where he plays
now. But look for Seattle to go for
the point guard, and in Oregon
State phenom GaryPayton, they

could have the best at that position ‘

in the draft. n

5. Miami — The Heat would
like nothing better than for
Derrick Coleman to slip to
number three in the draft. They
already have former Syracuse
players Rony Seikaly and Sherman

Matt ,  
Martin

Douglas, and with Glen Rice at
small forward and Coleman at

power forward, they would want ,

only for a solid shooting guard,
which they could easily pick up
in next year’s lottery.

4. Orlando — Sure, Nick
Anderson was a wonderful
ballplayer at Illinois, but one of
last year’s top ten picks? Nah. The
Magic must make the most of
their pick this year, and they
would be hard- pressed to bypass
Lionel Simmons of LaSalle, the
NCAA’s third all-time leading
scorer.

“S. Charlotte——Chris Jackson
seems a natural for the Hornets,
who have taken underclassmen
in both of the past two drafts (Rex
Chapman and Herman Reid).
Jackson’s presence would
presumably free up Chapman for
more scoring. But is a college
sophomore ready for the NBA?
Chapman was. ~

6. Minnesota— Nothing would
make the ‘hometown faithful
happier than for the
Timberwolves to draft Minnesota
forward Willie Burton. Team
him with Tony Campbell and
you have the foundation of a
good young team, as if that didn't
already exist there.

7. Sacramento — After trading
Kenny Smith to Atlanta last
season, the Kings desperately
need a solid point guard. And last
year’s number one pick, center
Pervis Ellison, is more familar
with the team doctors than he is
the Sacramento game plan. Still,
Ellsion needs time to grow, and
the Kings are willing to give it to
him. Rumeal Robinson of
Michigan will team with Danny
Ainge next year.

8, Los Angeles Clippers —
Once again the Clippers are in
the lottery, their ﬁfth such journey
to the Big Apple. This time,
however, they are loaded with
talent and can pick discriminately.
They could stand another good

Track teams return home I

with host of new records

By Paul Tatkovski '5
For The Pitt News

Elbert Elliscaptured both the 110—meter hurdles and the 400
intermediate hurdles at last weekend’s IC4A championships at
Yale University. Ellis garnered All-East honors with his victories,
and his time of 50.06 in the 400 IMH qualified him for the NCAA
Track and Field Championships. 0 _y

The Pitt men’s team tied Syracuse for seventh overall with
30.5 points, a long stretch from champion George Mason who
tallied 106 to run away with the invitational.

All—East honors were also earned by Dave Moore, Keith
Dowling, Chappale Burton and Darrin Gillaspie.

Dowling finished fifth in the 5,000, and in the process broke
Dave McDonald's 12-year-old school record by 47 seconds.
Burton, with a personal record, took sixth, in the 400 IMH.
Moore placed third in the 800, and Gillaspie leaped 6 feet, 9 3/
4 inches to take sixth overall in the high jump.

The lady tracksters traveled to George Mason University this
weekend for the ECAC championships. Five school records fell

’ by the wayside en route to capturing third place overall. Pitt
rang up 66 points, just four behind host George Mason and 18
behind champion Penn State. . _

Keisha Demas won the 400 in 52.63 seconds; in so doing she .
broke the Pitt record and qualified outright for the NCAA
championships. Ronise Crumpler earned first in the 200 with a
time of 23.86, and third in the 100. Allison Williams placed
second in the 100 high hurdles with a school—record time of
13.76. All-East honors were also captured by Clarissa Dudley for
finishing third in both the 100 hurdles and the heptathalon.

The women’s relay team of Dudley, Crumpler, Vanessa Jones
and Demas combined to win both the 1,600 and 400 races. The
400 added extra excitement as once again another Pitt record
was broken with a time of 46.11. _

Also worth noting are Kathleen Chrissos and Alexis Archer. ‘
While both just missed being named All-East by placing in the
top six, their performances were good enough to break school
records. Chrissos took eighth in the 1,500 with a time of 4:28.30,

' and Archer cleared 19 feet, 2 inches to take home seventh in the

long jump.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, May 23, 1990

 

By Doug Miller
For The Pitt News

With the addition of two top-20
teams to this year’s schedule, the
Pitt men's soccer team faces what

‘«> Coach Joe Luxbacher calls “the

most difficult schedule in Pitt
history.”

Perennial soccer powers
Syracuse and Connecticut round
out a schedule which includes
Big East powerhouses Boston
College, Seton Hall and
Providence. This both worries
and excites Luxbacher. “With such
a difficult schedule, we are going
to rely heavily on our more
experienced players,” he said.

Experience will be one of the
team’s luxuries in the upcoming

year. The goalkeeping appears
to be in the capable hands of
senior Jay Kapusta, a three-year
letterman who started all but two
games last year. His backup will
be senior Tim Sobelman.

In front of the goalies will be a
relatively cohesive defensive unit
led by Roberto Croce, Scott
McCurry and Carsten Bishop. The
Panthers will look to fill a huge
gap left by graduating senior
sweeper Heinz Pak. Luxbacher is
counting on highly touted Mike
Watson, a transfer student from
Commu nity College of Allegheny
County, to step in and fill the
void.

Midﬁelders must provide the
striking attackers with plenty of

support, as well as help defenders «

‘football’ teams; they drive vans
and buses and don’t always use
charter airplanes. So going to
Penn State may be no different
than going to West Virginia,” Fish
said.

Jim Jones, athletic director at
Ohio State, said his teams already
travel to State College, and he
does not foresee any problems in
the future if PSU were admitted.
Certainly not, as OSU is the closest
of the Big Ten schools to Penn
State and would see no change in
its travel plans anyway.

The benefits to PSU and the
other schools in the Big Ten
would be varied if the “Big Eleven”
ever Came, to pass.

Fish stressed that the main
reason for the expansion of the
Big Ten conference at this time
and for the long term is to put the
conference in a position to control
its own destiny. “For us to
continue that, we need to be a
conference both
academically and athletically, and
the addition of Penn State puts us
in a position to be stronger,” Fish
said.

Pearson said the exposure of
the Big Ten in the television
market would greatly beneﬁt from
the addition of Penn State. PSU

 

football has certainly gained its
share of fans all over Pennsylvania
and elsewhere due to its high
alumni concentration and loyal
fans. Penn State’s clean, free-
from—corruption image has also
helped the school in terms of fan
support. By Penn State becoming
part of the Big Ten’s television
package, the revenues brought
in could certainly benefit the
conference in the future.

Jones was unsure of the benefits
to his school if PSU were admitted.
“I don’t know how it’s not going
to benefit me; I'm hard pressed to
tell you how I’m going to beneﬁt.
I don’t know’ until the time
comes,” he said.

Penn State’s Thalman said that
the school has experienced good
relations with the administrators
of the Big Ten and feels that the
entire undertaking is on an
appropriate timetable.

“We’ve always wanted to be in
an all-sports conference. We
worked hard to establish one in
the East in the early 1980s without
any success. We feel we’ll benefit
both athletically and in a larger
sense academically by being
associated with Big Ten schools.
They're the kind of institutions
we want to align ourselves with
in the future,” Thalman said.

Three Rivers Film Festival downtown

By Dmitri Ragano

Showcase Editor

If you missed the Cannes Film
Festival (where David Lynch's
new road movie Wild at Heart
won the Golden Palm Award on
Monday), don't panic. You can
still catch the Three Rivers Film
Festival, which runs May 24 —
June 5 at the Fulton Theater and
Benedum Center Downtown.
This year’s festival boasts some
promising attractions from
around the world. Most of the
ﬁlms weren’t delivered in time
for a press screening, but here’s
a preview of a few that look

By Matthew Myers
Sta_ﬁ‘ Writer

By now, moviegoers have
come to expect
regularity in Robin Williams. In
his last two films, he has
demonstrated not only his
versatility as an actor, not only
his endless improvisational
abilities, but also his ambitions
as a serious performer. By now,
we’ve come to expect him not to

I be funny by the end of a movie.

With two Oscar nominations
under his belt (for G0odMoming,
Vietnam and DeadPoets Society),
Robin Williams has become
comedy's Renaissance Man.
While his movies never fail to
give us a glimpse of the stand—up
comic we all know and love,
they have always guaranteed us
a tear-jerking tragic hero in the
end. .

In his latest effort, Cadillac
Man, which openednationwide
on Friday, Williams continues to
give the kind of performance
that has ﬁrmly established him in
the motion picture industry.

In the film, Williams plays Joey
O'Brien, a car salesman in

The Music Teacher.
(Belgium, 1989) A slight,
wonderful film that takes place in
the opera world of the turn of the
century. A great opera star retires
at the peak of his career to open
a school in the country for two
students. The ego wars, costumed
glamour and breathtaking music
may remind you of Amadeus.

Twilight of the Cockroaches.

(Japan, 1987) The unusual and

tragic plight of cockroaches

Queens, N.Y. who lives life in the
proverbial fast lane. Not only is
he in debt up to his eyeballs (he
owes $20,000 to the mob), but he
is also juggling four women— his
ex—wife Tina (Pamela Reed from
television's “Grand”), to whom
he owes back alimony, Joy (Fran
Drescher from UHF), who is
married, Lila (Lori Petty from
television's “Booker”), who
spends all of his hard-earned cash,
and finally, his widowed mother
(marvelously portrayed by Mimi
Cecchini), who endlessly nags
him about his troubled lifestyle.

In the midst of all this, Joey is
about to lose his job unless he can
sell 12 cars by the end of the
week, before the company moves
to suburbia.

As if his life weren’t tempestuous
enough, he is soon forced to deal
with a psychotic husband named
"Larry (played by Tim Robbins),
who holds everybody hostage at
the auto showroom where Joey
works. Apparently his wife
Donna, the showroom’s secretary,
has been cheating on him with

The Mahabharata. (France/
Great Britain/USA, 1989) This
ancient Indian epic, longer than
the Bible, was hailed as one of
the great theatrical feats of the
century on Broadway several
years ago. Celebrated director
Peter Brook is responsible for
stunning, cinematic adaptions of
Marat/Sade and King Lear.

This sprawling three-hour opus
looks to be an event.

Martin Amis’ London Fields

London Fields
Martin Amis
Harmony Books

Nicola Six doesn’t like sodomy
because it pains her. Well, not

0' literally, but it is locally prevalent

in London.

Keith Talent often got drunk,
too drunk. One night he came
home, burped his wife, took his
newborn out for a walk and then
screwed his dog.

Guy Clinch has a hell child
named Marmaduke. Marmaduke

is less than 2 years old and french '

kisses his nanny (but his mother
wants that to stop. She should be
the only one to do that).

In a novel that can only be
lovingly referred to as tragically
bizarre, Martin Amis paints a
picture of an English murder
triangle that will leave the reader
laughing most embarrassingly to
himself.

It is a novel about a murderer

. o . . - .

and his murderee. Nicola is to die
by a man she meets at the Black
Cross, a London pub, and Guy or
Keith is the murderer. Plain and
simple. But it gets weird. It gets
really weird.

Nicola is a psychic. She can
foretell even the most simple
events and she always knows
when it’s the right time to.dump
her boyfriends. The cross Nicola
must bear is that she knows when
she is going to die and where.
The reader, however, must wait
until the end of the book.

Keith is the bad guy. He’s the
real bad guy that is one /of
England's most notorious
criminals and dart champions. He
is quite smitten with Nicola.

Guy is a bored rich man who
sincerely loves his wife and their
demonic son. He also loves Nicola.

An actress by nature, Nicola
has found herself both using and
being used by men. Since she
knows she is to die, she decides

to exploit both men even before
she knows which is the murderer.

A sexual madman, Keith's only
satiation comes through chronic
masturbation to Nicola’s special
homemade videos. She’ doesn’t
allow him to touch her, just to
watch her on the VCR in her
bedroom. \

A hopeless romantic, Guy is
fooled into believing that Nicola
is a virgin and he is the one (the
chosen one) to deﬂower her.
Guy plans secret meetings with
her daily (and isn’t it funny how
Keith always seems to be leaving
when Guy’s arriving?) so that he
can teach her how to kiss
properly.

Oh yeah, ensnared in this
femme fatale’s web is yet another
man, Samson Young, the
American author who stumbles
upon this unfortunate triad. He
doesn’t love Nicola; at least, he
doesn’t think he does. He is the

‘ Award last year at Cannes for this

exploration of Gypsy culture.
Most of the cast are Yugoslav
Gypsies speaking in their native
tongue. (The ﬁlm was subtitled
even in Yugoslavia.)

Ariel. (Finland, 1988) The

Village Voice has called Finnish
director Aki Kaurismaki Europe's
“Next Big Thing.” This ﬁlm about
the adventurers of an unemployed
laplander was a hit at last year’s
Toronto Film Festival.

Henry: Portrait of a Serial
Killer. (USA, 1986) One of many
recent “artistic” ﬁlms to get tagged
with an X rating. A fictionalized,
graphically violent story of serial

killer Henry Lee Lucas, now on
death row in Texas.

ForAllManleind. (USA, 1988)
Director Al Reinert’s ﬁlm of
manned Apollo ﬂights to the
moon. Combines footage from
NASA archives with narration of
surviving astronauts.

Mr. Hoover and 1. (USA,

1989) J. Edgar Hoover had a ﬁle

FBI director he calls “the most

dishonorable person in the whole
history of this great country.”

LaLoosh from Bull Durham, is
convincing as the moronic Larry.
One really believes he is the
biggest idiot on Earth with his

Williams, making very few
changes in the script, is genuinely
plausible as the hero.

Although the ending is a little
bit like DieHard, with its sudden,
arbitrary police-thank-the—hero
bit, the movie stands up on its
own, and Williams gives a terrific
performance as the harried

her cute little Pomeranian dog,

Williams’ snappy
improvisational banter. We are

things seems contrived.

Nicola does indeed meet her fate,

but in the most twisted way *"

imaginable, lending even more
literary fire to this black comedy.
London Fields is a brilliantly
fast-paced novel that has extreme
depth and clarity about society’s
unfortunates. Amis has provided
for his reader a fresh carnival in
the obscure and a jagged mirror of

modern-day sexual exploitation.
