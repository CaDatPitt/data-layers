Second Half Outburst Pitt Students for McCarthy
BY COHESE Bowl Team Announce Initial Meeting

Shoots Down Kansas

by JAY ROSENSTESN
Unperturbed by Kansas’ opening burst of 85 points,
undaunted by a barrage of music and art questions, and
apparently unaffected by a second weekend in New York,
the University’s College Bowl team refused to play second
fiddle to four Jayhawks as it shot down Kansas, 260-140

last night.

Pitt’s quartet came dramatically from behind for the second
straight week. After spotting Kansas the ﬁrst three questions, the
fearsome foursome got moving. Mike Brouzrman, who claims to be
a political science major. recognized E.isenberg’s (sic) principle of
higher physics to put Pitt on the scoreboard. With the mood light-
ened, the team began the comeback which enabled it to return next
week to face Furman University of South Carolina.

Kathy Trosan, majoring in history, knew what it meant “to
play second fiddle” and that William Blake wrote the “Songs of
Innocence.” Her two correct tossups helped cut the J ayhawks’ half-

time margin to 9560.

Maybe it was the ﬁlm of the rolling Kansas campus. Or per-
haps it was “Hawk” Bro-urman’s resolve to destroy those who use

his nickname for their own
purp-oses. W-haltever, Pitt rolled
after the intermission and ﬁrm-
ly established i-ts tradition as a
second half team.

With Captain ‘George Gray,
also a history major, buzzing on
tossups with answers such as
computer programing and The
Madrigal, and Tom Graves, an-
other history major, contribut-
ing bonus responses on ques-
tions of English literature and
music, Pitt took the momentum
away from Kansas.

The score was 140-105 when
Miss Trosan answered the ﬁrst
four consecutive tossups. Know-
ing about Prince Mishkin cut
Kansas’ lead to 140-130. 'I‘hen
Miss Trosan choked off any
chance the Jayhiawvkis might
have had when sh-e correctly
pronounced the last names of
the last three Chancellors of
West Germany: Adenhauer, Er-
hard, and Kissinker. Brourman
quickly popped in the bonus an-
swer of the Revolutionary War
“Battle of Saratoga” and Pitt
was in front 160-140.

The nervous crowd in the stu-

dent Union began urging Pitt to
“pour it on.” “Pour it on was an
understatement.” By the time
Miss Trosan got the last of her
tossups and Captain Gray drawl-
ed the appropriate bonus re-
plies, the score had mushroom-
ed to 250-140. Miss Trosan had
known the name of the “and”
sign on a typewriter for her
answer of the
night.

Gray added a ﬁnal tossup an-
swer, identifying “Baudelaire,”
to climax a 1500-0 Pi-tt surge.

The broad spectrum of
student political thought at
the University is showing
strong signs of coalescance
in support of Senator Eu-
gene McCarthy’s bid for the
Democratic nomination for Pres-

ident. A group to be known «as the
Pitt Students for McCarthy is

presently organizing support for
the Senator's campcaiegn.
Representatives of the cross

Sexuality And Personality,

Topics For Fall Symposium  

by MELVYN LEVIN
A group of students from the Pitt YWCA and the Associated
Woman Students (AWS) have intiated a symposium on sexuality
and the total personality and are in the process of recruiting mem-
bers for the program. This symposium has met with both faculty

and administrative approval.

Some of the ideas being considered for such -a symposium in-

Students Express Opinions

SG Elections Elicit

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
“Armand Belly did what

“he set out to do,” stated a

sophomore. “By giving a
crucial issue to a campaign
that desperately needed one
he gave the student body a
real choice to make,” she added.

One junior remarked that
“Due to the extremely close
margin of votes, I don't think
that Ken Schueler can interpret
his election as a victory. This
should indicate to Schueler that
he will have to work hard to
accomplish Student Government
(SG) reforms and not keep the
present status quo,” he said.

“I didn’t expect Belly to get so
many votes," a sophomore told
me. “I’m glad he didn’t win,"
she went on to say. “There was
just too much he left unexplain-
ed.”

There was a general reaction
to the campaign methods used
for the election. “The campaigns
were lousy, particularly that of

the United Student Association‘

it it

(USA),” a freshman stated.

Other students agreed that the
campa.igns were dull. “The is-
sues weren’t clariﬁed," another
freshman complained. “The only
topic frequently discussed was
whether to abolish SG or not,”
he said.

“The Senate elections were a
farce,” a sophomore stated. Some
candidates didn’t really have to
campaign because they have a
‘-name on campus’ already,” she
added.

She went on to say that “It's
a shame that the status quo al-
ways wins.”

“I think there was more ex-
citement because Belly entered
the presidential race,” one jun-
ior said. “It generated some in-
terest in a campaign that no
one would have paid any atten-
tion to otherwise,” he clariﬁed.

Several commuters expressed
the desire of being more in-
volved in elect-ion activities.
Some of these commuters ex-
pllained that they did not vote

because they did not fee1them-

the differences between male
and female sexualilty; popular
misconceptions about sex, homo-
sexuality, masturbation, ‘perver-
sion, and obs-enity; the Playboy
philosophy and situation ethics;

problems of communicating with .

the opposite sex; premarital
sex relations; contraceprtivons;
the church’-s view on sex; and,
possible grounds for personal
sexual values.

The symposium also hopes to
receive the advice of Dr. Mary
Calerone, an authority in the
ﬁeld -of hetero sexual relation-
ships. This distinguished doctor
wlarns, “If you are not concern-
ed about .a girl as a human be-
ing, consider what it will do to
your sense of yourself to use
her for temporary gratiﬁcation.”

Dr. Calderone feels that every
young man should know and ac-
cept the fact that because he
plays a. crucial role in develop-

didate, Pitt Progressive Party;
chairman, Lifbera-.1 Uni-on), Jef-
frey Leach (president, Sigma
Ailplha Epsilon Firaaternity; vice-
president, VV:illliam Pitt Delbvalte
Union), and Loren Hershey
(chairman, Hill Educational Proj-
ect (HEP); president pro temp,
Student Government Senate).

The group's feeling is that
with hard work “certain dis-
tricts in Pittslburgih will -most
deﬁnitely elect favorable (Pro-
M-cCa:rthy) delegations” and its
intentions are to do that work.

The organization’s speciﬁc pur-
pose will .be to support the of-
ﬁical M c C at th y organization,
Citizens for McCarthy, in the
forthcoming elections for dele-
gates to the Democratic Con-
vention in Chicago which will
take place .in August. The co-
chairman will serve to co-ordi-
nate student interests with the
interests of the citizen's group.
To facilitate the workings of
the two groups, the city group
has opened an office two blocks
from the University. The office,
located at 3618 Forbes Ave., it
is hoped, will provide the neces-
sary linkage of student and citi-
zen efforts.

'Ilhe ﬁrst organization meeting

for the group will take place 

Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the Sup-
per Room of the SU. The pur-
pose of the meeting was brief-
ly outlined by J ohn Rusloay, “We
are not forming simply to talk
on campus about Senator Mc-
Carthy. We are organizing be-
cause we believe there is some
small hope of affecting policy
by supporting his candidacy at
this time. For those who are in-
terested in getting out and work-
ing at staffing the McCarthy
headquarters, circulating the pe-

Various Responses

selves adequlately informed. “The
forums and speaking engage-
ments of the candidates were
not publicized enough,” was
heard from both commuters and
dormitory residents.

One of the commuters also
stressed that “Most of the things
on this campus are done with
the dormitory resident -in mind.”

A great majority of stu-dents
commented on the pitifully small
voting representation. There was
Ia-pproximately ia 700 vote drop
fro-m last year’s turnout. “A
vote resullt like this year’s .s=how's
a striking indifference of the
student body to important is-
sues affecting Univetrsity life,”
a senior stated.

Another widespread agreement
concerned Armand Belly’s
chances of election. “If Belly
had been running as president
for SG instead of trying to abol-
ish it if elected, I would most
certainly have voted for him,” a
junior declared. This position
was upheld 'by a majority of

I other students.

“I wanted Armand to win,"
one freshman said, “but I wwn’t
particularly enthusiastic about
any of the candidates.” Another
freshman stated that he voted
for Ken Schueler for lack of a
better candidate to support.

An enormous number of stu-
dents are dissaxtiasﬁed with SG
in its present form. This was
demonstrated by the poor vot-
ing representation as well as
general disinterest and ridicule
of SC. Yet the fact that Armand
Belly didn’t win shows that, at
least for the students who voted
i-n the election, there is a hope
for a renewed SG instead of
abolishing the entire structure.

Student Government will
hold an open meeting at 9 p.m.
Wednesday in Dining Room

Fantastic Four Defeat

The Evil Doctor Doom

by HOBART HARRIS
Take heart, intellectuals. This season’s thin bag of
decent literature has finally been thickened by a work
worthy of all of us. Happy? Encouraged? Smug? I bet
you are. Marvel Cwon.icI.= has brought 0-ut its newest Collector’s

In this issue, Marvel has brought all the talents that has so
endeared its literature to us to the fore. There is the mov.ing love

nice guy with a skin problem. There is a m-onavl puzzlle worthy of

Pifer Predicts Increasing

Federal Aid to Education

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn-
(CPS)——Carnegie Corpora-
tion President Alan Pifer
told the American Associa-
tion of Colleges (AAC) last
week that the Federal Gov-
ernment will provide half of all

funds for higher education by
1975.

Pifer, whose foundation is one

most of them small liberal arts
schools, added its Voice to the
growing call for general support
grants. The AAC also called for
increases in other types of fed-
eral aid.

But Pifer went on to tell the
educators that ﬁnancing is not
the only major problem they
face. He called for better co-op-
el‘afi0n between universities and
the Federal Government, adding

that impinges on higher educa-
tion institutions.”

He also called for the creation
of a set of national policies on
higher education and intimated
that Carnegie’s Commission on
Higher Education, headed by
former University of California
President Clark Kerr, might
very well produce a detailed set
of such proposals.

Piifer also outlined several pos-

COT Presents WVU Ensemble   

The SU Committee on the
Arts will present the West Vir-
ginia University Percussion En-
semble in a free concert Wed-
nesday at 8 p.m. in the SU Ball-
room.

Recognized as one of the most
outstanding percussion groups
in the country, the 13 member
West Virginia University Per-
cussion Ensemble is conducted
by Philip J. Faini. It is one of
few such ensembles engaged in

regular rehearsals and perform.-
ances in this country. The group
-has toured extensiv-ely for the
past ﬂve_ years with appearances
on radio and television and at
colleges and high schools
throughout the Eastern US.
This year the Ensemble will
feature Dr. James Miltenberger
as guest artist. A staff member
of the Creat.ive Arts Center at
West Virginia University, Dr.
Miltenberger has recently com-

pleted a most ‘successful New
York recital at Carnegie Hall.
In a review of his performance,
the New York Times stated, “His
technique was strong, exciting,
his musicianship excellent and
his phrasing astute and sensi-
tive.” .-

Over the past five years the
West Virginia Percussion En-
semble has premiered 15 new
works for percussion. With over
100 instruments classiﬁed as per-

cussion, the Ensemble is able
to present interesting and excit-
ing programs containing an al-
most endless variety of rhythm-
ic and tonal combinations.

Wednesday’s program will in-
-clude arrangements of classi-call,
jazz, and popular music. The
Ensemble will also present a
group of Pr-eludes and Fugues
by Bach arranged in a style
popularized by the Swingle Sing-
ers.

Double Bill
Friday Night

This Friday Harold P-inter-’s
The Dumb Waiter and Murray
Schisgal’s The Old Jew will re-
turn to the repertory of the
University’-s Friday Night The-
atre. The double bill played to
full houses for both its perform-
ances Jan. 19. Both plays, like
most of the offerings in the Stu-
dio Theatre, are chosen because
of their contemporary appeal.

The ScIh.is~ga.l and Pinter selec-
tions are modern plays which
treat themes especially predomi-
nanrt in the drama of today —
the cruelty underlying man's ex-
perience and the tenzuousness of
reality. '

The double bill will be pre-
sented at both 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.
in 1001 CL. Tickets are available
at 1117 CL ﬂor $1 each.

SIGMA TAU
A meeting of Sigma Tau is
scheduled for Thursday at noon

On Sexuality

(Continued from Page 1.)

ing a young woman’s emotional
maturity, he must accept the re-
sponsibility that goes with it.

He must understand that the
sexual act for a woman tends
to be the ultimate exxpression of
what she feels about life. If she
engages in sexual relations be-
fore she is mature enough, the
ability to enjoy sexual experi-
ence may be hindered and her
capacities for a deeper relation-
ship may bearrested.

“I am concentra-ting here on
the impact of men on the life, of
every young girl with whom
they share an emotional b-ond.
In my experience, men are gen-
erally unaware of the extent of
this impact or unconcerned about
it. As a resullt, their behavior is
all too often irresponsible. My
hope is that in sharpening
awareness of how a girl grows
up, I may increase both their
concern and their sense of re-
sponsibility.’’

Dr. Oalderone’s ideas will be
discussed at the next meeting.

OMICRON DELTA EPSILON '

Omicron Delta Epsilon, the
national honor society in eco-

Last March The Pitt News did a series of articles on the Uni‘-
velsity Book Center and the conflict of interest concerning John C.
Langstaff’s dual capacity as owner of Your Campus Store and direc-
tor of Auxiliary Enterprises, where he is responsible for the Book
Center.

The Pitt News’ investigation revealed that Your Campus Store
carried a much more complete line of items bearing the University
seal such as mugs and glassware, which are sold in limited quantities

“in our Book Center. We pointed out at the time that the University

did carry a more complete line of such items until a few years ago,
When, according to the manager of Your Campus Store, “my boss
(Langstaff) picked (the line) up. We bought out what the Bookstore
had—-they didn't want to handle this line of merchandise any more.”
However, as we pointed out then, the University of‘ficia1 statement
issued about this issue proclaimed, “Your Campus Store has never
purchased any discontinued or surplus items from the Book Center,”
failing to answer whether or not the merchandise was taken on.

We said at the time that the above statements leave doubt in
the students’ minds as to the real state of events.

Let us quote from our editorial of March 17, 1967: “By permit-
ting Langstaff to serve as Director of Auxiliary Enterprises and also
own Your Campus Store, the University places itself in a vulnerable
position. The very idea that the two operations are competitive in
their nature, regardless of how they so designate themselves, gives
rise to serious questions of a real conflict of interest.

“We are not doubting the personal integrity of any of the indi-
viduals involved. However, we do feel that the very fact that Lang-

Editorial: The Book Center Revisited

staff’s capacities can be interpreted as unethical by some necessitates
that the University take immediate action to satisfactorily resolve a
most unsatisfactory situation.”

Here We are, ten months later, and an editorial written last
March is still applicable, for, to the best of our knowledge, John Lang-
staff remains owner of Your Campus Store.

The‘ reason for raising this issue initially was to point out that
the items carried by Your Campus Store are typically sold in college
bookstores and can increase sales and profits -so that a student dis-
count can be extended to all items sold in our Book Center, instead of
the token discount now in effect.

This intolerable situation is characteristic of the questionable
standards students are confronted with countless times they have
legitimately questioned the financial policies that directly concern
them. How long must the students tolerate this continual runaround?
The specific case cited represents an instance where students did pro-
ceed through the “right” channels, but, as usual, we were denied the
satisfaction of achieving our legitimate goals, for the administration
attempted to pacify us by giving us a watered—down discount.

The Pitt News feels that this issue should now be reviewed, be-
cause it vitally affects our entire student body. There is no reason
we students should not be receiving the ten per cent across the board
discount now enjoyed by our faculty and staff. There are means of
increasing the profitability of our Book Center; those i'n charge have
not chosen to utilize these means.

We promise to keep this embarrassing situation in the forefront
until it is satisfactorily resolved.

Easy Grades

A Student’s Reward

by Chuck Dworak

THERE SHOULD BE some
‘5¥pS'0‘l.fCVUrSlil3VeI1‘l%t3lnoIl s:iaa'tli°t
or poicy se up to insure the
student of getting fair and mer-
irtable treatment in the courses

he takes. Although the large

' mlaj-ority of courses at the Uni-

versity are taught by professors
who do a commendable job, a
student will not necessarily get
such -a performance when he
walks into any classroom.

Last trimester a professor in
a course offered for distribution
of studies gave three tests and
a ﬁnal examination during the
term. On the ﬁn-al, he required
the class to “list those required
readings to which you can sin-
cerely say, ‘I have read these
items!’’’ The word “s-in-cerely"
was underlined. The student was
allowed to copy the title-s from
a list prepared for this purpose.
I later found the professor had

used this question to determine

a student's performance in the
course, and in most cases had

disregarded the tests given dur-

ing the term.

It did not matter that a stu-
dent had averaged a B or an A
on h.is test-s during the trimes-
ter. An unsatisfactory answer
on this list of readings had en-
titled the student, in the profes-
sor's min-d, to a “bare pass” or
even failure in t.he course. I also
discovered that any student
could have listed all the required
titles on his exam paper and
received an honor grade in the
he had re-ad

I WAS TOLD by the depart-
ment ohaairmlan that while he
disagreed with such meth:ods of
grading there was nothing he
could do about it. He only h-oped
the situation might be corrected
in the future. Subsequent dis-
cussions with the Dean of the
School. of Liberal Arts reveal-

tices. A student can only avoid
taking such a course by learn-
lffg 31B3llt it 'tl*i‘i‘E>'1'1'gh the "grape-
vine." It made me wonder out
loud what it would be like for
the University of Pittsburgh to
be known as a place where one
student can li-e and bluffhis way
through courses while another
may not be rewarded properly
for his efforts.

It is an injustice to the stu-
dent, and it also brings disgrace
to a university to be subjected
to such haphazard methods of
grading. It also is a reﬂection
on a college when a student has
to avoid a course because it is
n-ot being taught or graded prop-
erly.

The course evvaluations set up
by the Liberal Arts Cabinet is
the best effort at present to in-
form the students of good cours-
es. Despite its intentions, it is
merely an.-other “grapevine.” Be-
sides, many students may be re-
luctant to answer the C-abinet’s
questionnaire honestly for fear
of being penalized, even though
the lecturer only sees the tab-
ulated results. The evaluations
are eallso taken during the mid-
dle of the term, when the stu-
dent has probably not been able
to form a complete opinion of
his professor.

THERE ARE PENALITIES
ranging from failure on a test
to dismissal from the University
for students who are caught us-
ing undesirable methods for
achieving their grades. Propos-
als have even been made for the
establishment of an honor sys-
tem to prevent students from
cheating on tests. But Universi-
ty rules give the student littlle

Letters to the Editor

AmericanApathy
Rates Comment

Editor, Pitt News:

If the following article at times
appears “bitter” or “sarcastic,”
please remember that is the pur-
pose of the author.

I had the exceedingly great
pleasure to hear Olatunji and
His Drums of Passion in a per-
formance in the Stephen Foster
Memorial Auditorium. On the
surface those representatives of
the student-faculty body in at-
tendance also shared my enthu-
siasm for the performance. Al-
though I have not, in the past,
attended many University spon-
sored activities, this was the
first time I have seen a Univer-
sity audience give a ﬁne per-
former a standing ovation.

Before this night, my know-
ledge of Africa was acquired
mostly from Hemingway's
stories, from so-called “White
Hunter” movies and programs,
-and from a recent four hour
television special on Africa. This
night, however, I was privileged
to witness a ﬁne representation
of contemporary Africa and
some of its best citizens.

Michael Olatunji was not what
one would call a physically strik-
ing man. Indeed, he was a quiet
looking man of average stature.
Yet his “shining” eyes spoke of
inﬁnite gentility and wisdom,
and his hands, through his
drums, spoke of a lively and na-
tional feeling that is becoming
more apparent in the new Afri-
can nations and in the vis-ibﬂe
“Afro-American -subculture.”

But fo-r all my approval of
Mr. Olatunji and his company,
I cannot help but feel an equal
sense o-f guilt and disapproval
of a less obvious response given
by the audience that tonight.
That response was one I choose
to call “silent embarrassment.”

Those present will recall that
Mr. Olatunji, after the intermis-
sion, came back on stage and
spoke brieﬂy of his people, their
culture, and the problems con-
fronting them today. His words
were -soft and, perhaps because
of his accent, seemingly naive.
Yet one could not help but sense
the sincerit oft--those honest  d

      

     
  
   

basic words. He spoke of four
years in Atlanta, Ga., and of the
good people he met there—the
people we don't hear of through
our news media. _He spoke of
his cultural center in Harlem
and offered his services to those
who might care to come and
learn of his people. He» spoke
of Western universities and of
Western culture.

He spo-ke of the well known
need for better unders-tanding
and non-violent community ex-
perience. He spoke, in short, as
a good “American” citizen should
speak, and, in a large sense, he
is an “American” citizen. And
ﬁnally, he spoke and offered a
vote of conﬁdence to the young
college generation of America.
Yet we sat in shame and an-
swered his vote of conﬁdence
with “silent embarra!s'smen.t.” No
standing ovation, no applause,
only deafening silence shlaittered
occasionally by a nervous rattle
of a drum.

The performance given by Mr.
Olatunji was not my ﬁrst en-
counter with foreign visitors. I
was recently privileged to speak
with a young social worker‘ on
leave from his country to work
on the problem of drug addic-
tion in the Pittsburgh area. We
spoke of many things from
sports to the “self-imposed apa-
thy” of many American citizens.
Our foreign visitors are as

aware as we of the apathy of

the average American. Yet, here,
too, they seem to be aware of
the new interest of the young
“college generation.” However,
I ﬁnd myself looking again at
the interest of our generation.
We are all painfully aware of
the use of marijuana and LSD
(lysergic acid dime-tlhylamide)
on college campuses, yet how

many are aware of the hard"

narcotic problem that has be-
come almost an unconscious
way of life in such areas as the
Hill District and Ho-mewood.

Those who read this article,
if any, may choose to agree or
disagree with the opinions it
contains. Yet is there anyone
so naive as to disavow the
“Aimericlan” apathy? This sum-
mer I heard a most amazing so-
lution to the “Negro problem”
in America as put forth by a
young college educated business
man. He said, “Send them all
back to Africa!” Even to those
so-called liberals I must ask,
“What will you do today?” Vlf-hat
will you do the next time you
meet Michael Ollatu-nji?

On my way home after the
performance I noticed an ath-
letic group of college males dem-
onstrate their m-ascutlinity by
lifting the front of a tiny VW
parked in the drive way of the
Towers garage. The cute coed
inside giggled her a.ppI‘0Vlal, and
a tear fell for the “lost” Amer-
ican.

Cornell Univ.
Studies Ties
With CAL

ITHACA, N. Y. (CPS) —- In
-the midst of national criticism
of universities who do military
research, Cornell University may
sever connections with its mili-
tary research arm.

A committee appointed by the
university's board of trustees
has recommended separation be
tween Cornell and Cornell Aero-
nautical Laboratory (CAL).
More than two-thirds of CAL’s
$30 million in research is per-
formed under contracts from
the Defense Department. About
half of the military work is
classiﬁed.

The commisttee gave three rea-
sons for its recommendations:
the lack of signiﬁcant education-
al and research interaction be-
tween the unliversity and CAL,
the need to provide the labora-
tory with an effective indepen-
dent board of directors, and the
overlap and potential conﬂict be-
tween CAL’s increasing over-
seas research projects and the
university’s expanding program
of internatlional studies.

On this latter point, the com-
mittee said, “International schol-

* ans can only work effectively if

it is clear to everyone, and most
particularly to the people in the
countries involved, that their
goal is pure scholarship. Hence,
a. defense-oriented CAL applied
research program operated un-
der Cornell’s name constitutes
a serious threat to ‘the viability
of these Cornell programs.”

CAL was received as a gift
from Curtitss Wright Corp. in
1946 and has since been a sep-
-arately incorponaited, wholly-
owned subsidiary of Cornell Uni-
versity since 1948. However, all
‘but three of its 24-member board
of directors are Cornell trustees,
-ﬂaculty, and a-dmcinistratorbs.”

Swimmers Sink Lions,

Set Ficve Pool Records

by ART ROSENGARTEN
“A real happy crew who shared a good time,” was
how coach Bill Grant summed up his swimming team’s

record-setting win over Penn State.

Grant"s boys had plenty to be happy about as they set five Penn

State pool records, just missed
another one, and gained their frst
win of 1968. The final score was
71-42 and raised the swimmers
to a 2-4 record.

“Everybody once again did their
best times of the season,” said a
smiling Grant. “We knew State’s
weak points and troubles and we
tried not to lay it on them, just
like the way Bucknell treated us.”
In same races. the swimmers on=
ly entered one man instead of the
customary two, in order to keep
the score respectable.

Swimming in Penn State’s
brand new Natatorium before a
close to capacity crowd of 1500
partisan fans, the swimmers were
at their best. Chris Price led the

Kent Defeats
Gym Team,
Shidemantle

by CHUCK DWORAK

Despite three ﬁrst place ﬁn-
ishes by Dave Snhi-lde-mantle,
Kent State handed the gymnasts
ta 138.95-105.90 loss Saturday at
Trees Hall. It was the gym
t~eam’s seventh loss of the sea-
son.

The 1966 EIGL longhorse chlam-
pion came back from last week's
poor performance on his special-
ty with a 9.55. He allso won the
trampoline and still rings events
with scores of 7.1. Shidemantle
has won the longhorse event
seven times in the team’s eight
meets to enhance his return to
the EIa.stern Gymnastics cham-
‘pionship meets in March.

Brian Gallagher, Shideman-
t'le’s opponent as all-around man,
led the Kent S-taters to wins on
floor exercise and parallel bars
with scores of 8.65 and 7.9, re-
spectively. Phil Naukam paced

the high bar competition with
a 7.5.

“Kent State had a good day
despite Gallagher's unusual per-

formance,” said coach Warren

- Neiger. Gallagher committed the

gymnasts’ cardinal sin «on the
longhorse when he repeated his
cartwheel on the optional sec-
ond try for a zero score.

For the gymnasts, the ﬁrosh

 

record parade with two new
marks in the 200 individual med-
ley (2:l2.03) and the 200-yard
breaststroke (2:23.93). Howard
Norris chalked up a, record in
the 200—yard butterfly (2:09.3)
and a victory in the 400-yard
medley relay.

John Lane was another record
setter and double winner. He set
his new mark in the 100-yard
freestyle (250.30) and captured
the 200—yard freestyle. The team’s
other double winner was Richard
Norris in the 50-yard freestyle
and the 200—yard backstroke.

The final record was set by
diver Dean Coleman in the 3
meters diving. An unexpected
victor was number two diver
Chester Zientek who nudged Cole"
man out of a victory in the 1
meter diving by fiVe—hundre’ths

Cats Battle
Miami (0.)

Tomorrow

by GEORGE LIES
A-ssociate Sports Editor
Bob Timmons felt a little
more relaxed Saturday
night, especially after Rob
McFarland gave everyone at the
Field Hou.se an instant replay.
The replay wasn't slow mo-
tion; it came quick, the vway
Timmons wanted it. ,
Down by a single point to a

quick, aggressive Tulane quin- ‘

tet, and two-and-a-half minutes
away from winning two games
in a row for the ﬁrst time since
1964-65, the Panthers’ coach call-
ed time out. Just then, scarcely
a slp-l-it second afterwards, Mc-
Farland hit a long one-handed
jumper, giving the Cats a 72-71
lead.

The basket was nulliﬁed, and
more than one person turned a.
different shade of frustration.

But at 1:30, nearly a minurte
«after the Panther offensive strat-
egy had failed, McFarland did
it over again. He had -rnissed a
free throw, but Ken Bollens re-
bounded to give McFar‘land an-
other chance.

McFarland’s second attempt,
a driving layup from the top of
the key, ﬁnally did give the
Panthers an official 72-71 lead.
Yet the game wasn’t over for
McFarland.

After Tulane missed a chance
at retaking .the lead, McFarland
hit a foul -shot, missed a (second;
Charlie Hunt rebounded and Mc-
Farland again shot and-scored.

His basket made it 75-71. Tu-
lane’s Johnny Artlhurs made it
75-73, but with only four seconds
remaining, Timmons and the 834
persons on hand sat back.

In the locker room after the
game, a shower-wet McFarl1and
pointed-out that the team has
been working “more together”
lately.

“I missed two foul shots, but
Ken and Charlie got the ball
back to "me. And right after that
time out I made a basket, so it
really «didn't matter about the
ﬁrst shot,” McFarland explain-
ed.

Bob Dodson shows his form on the sidehorse.

again put on a good show. Low-
ell Meek tied Shidemantle for
second. place on ﬂoor exercise
with an 8.60, and Phil Lilly grab-
bed a first in the sidehorse with
7.5. Dave Andrew went over the
the longhorse in an “L” forma-
tion for an 8.85, his top score
of the season.

Tom Fisher, however, was
bothered by some of the prob-
lems on still rings that plagued
him in the Navy meet. He show-
ed excellent balance on his

 

swings and inverted hangs, but
failure to hold the “L” forma-

,tion and an awkward dismount

held him to a 6.75.

“The boys looked better to-
day than they did last week,”
commented Neiger. “Buit 
er needs more work on still
rings, and Lilly needs a harder
routine to work on in parallel
bars. He did an excellent job
on t-he parallels in this meet but
he only scored a 5.15 because of
its simplicity.”

At 8:15 p.m. (tomorrow the

Stale Cubs Seek Third Win
Against ‘Strong’ Little Dukes

Bread gets stale when it
is left on the shelf too- long.
And basketball teams can
get stale also. That is the latest
problem of freshman basketball
coach "Dim Grgulrich.

The Cubs have been idle for
12 days, and tomorrow night
they will be playing a strong
Duqu-esne frosh team. Game
time is 6:15 p.m. at the Field
House.

Grgurich would not have had
to worry about his team if last
Thursday night’s game ag1a-inst
the Youngstown JV was not can-
celed. But it was, and Grgurich
thinks the resulting layoff could
hurt.

“Youngstown canceled all their
games,” said a disappointed Grg-
urich. “Their boys must be in
trouble with grades.”

The Cubs had shown Grgurich
signiﬁcant improvement beﬁore

last week. Aﬁter losing their

 

rfirst two games of the season,
they beat Point Park and the

Little Mountaineers of West "

‘Virginia handily.

“If we don’t play someone
Thursday night we'll get stale,”
expmaained Gr-gurisch last Monday.
“When you just practice and
don't play any -gtaxm-es for 12
days it's going to hurt the play
of the team when we do play.”

Grgurich tried to ﬁnd an in-
dependent team to play, but fail-
edtobookagamasohehad
the Cubs playing against each
other, instead. But it seemed to
be a poor substitute. And when
Tom Withers hurt his knee with
about four minutes remaining in
the scrimmage, the game had to

be stopped because there were

no replacements.

Barry Nelson, plus 6-4 Jarrett

Despite Lower Weight Sweep ‘

Matmen Fall to Army

by ROY JACOBS
For a While Saturday, it looked like the varsity
wrestlers were about to manage their second upset in a
row. But Army overcame the grapplers’ nine point lead
in the last six matches to secure a 24-11 win.
The meet followed a similar pattern to last season's encounter
with Army, when the eventual outcome was decided in the heavy-

weight bout. This year the match
that clinched the win was the 191
pound match, where Terry Hoov-
er lost to possible Eastern cham-

pion Hugo Croft on riding time-

As in their victory over Cor-

" nell last week, the matmen swept

through the lower weight class-
es. This time, however, they are
unable to get a couple wins in
the higher weight classes to clinch
a team victory.

‘I knew that Army was strong
up above,” said coach Dave Ad-
ams afterwards, “but I thought
we had a chance. We carried the
fight to them. We were ‘more ag-
gressive. They just outdid us with

rosh Track Team Swamps Penn State, 77-22

S’ Nolan, Salter Also Star
As Three Records Fall

by DAVE TIERNAN
“I’l1 break four minutes this spring,” said Jerry
Richey, after his efforts in the mile and two—mile relay
led the freshman track team to a 77-22 win over the Penn

State frosh Saturday.

Richey responded to the 1000 screaming fans with a
4:O8.6 mile, after Mike Shurko, the Lion freshman who
barely lost to Richey last year in the state high school

finals, fell behind after the first half-mile.

When Richey looked ahead to the “four minute mile,” he noted
that he must have competition to run his best. If his anchor leg in
the two—mile relay was an indication of what he meant, he could run

four minutes sooner than he thinks.

Forty yards separated Richey
from the young Lion anchorman,
but Richey passed him on the
third lap and finished with twen-
ty-yards to spare and a, new frosh
record of 8:09.7. Mark Vonnhag-
en, John Crozier and Dick Wam-
er had run the first three legs of
the relay.

Coach Jim Banner pointed out

Warner as an up and coming run-
er. Warner” had not run for two
years while he was in prep school,
and. come out late this season to
begin working. His leg in the re-
lay Saturday against Shurko was
his first race since high school.

“He (Warner) will be good. He
is now working real hard and has
tremendous ability,” said Banner
after the race.

The third frosh record of ﬂue
meet came when Mike Nolan
broke his own record with a
9:34.2 time in the two-mile tun.
Nolan started slowly in his race,
but finished with a kick that last-
ed for nearly two laps.

Amid the cheering fans, Ban-
ner could be seen smiling as the
short frosh distanceman sprinted
to the finish line. Nolan was smil-
ing latter, but feels he can do
much batter. “I have to run a
faster first mile,” he said.

In running up their score, the
frosh won every event but the
shot put and pole vault. Bryant
Salter led the point-winners with

13 points. He jumped 6’2” to win‘

the high jump, 21’9” in winning
the broad jump and finished sec-
ond to teammate Elliott Drys-
dale whose time was 7.9, in the
high hurdles.

Sprinter Dave Garnett, who

i Late Stages, 24.11  

along with Salter and Richey has
been invited to invitational tour-
naments during the season, led
fellow football players Mike Car-
nell and J. D. Lewis in a sweep
of the 60 yard dash. Gamett’s
time of-:6.5 was just off his :6.4
frosh record.

Crowd -pleaser Smitty Brown,
who also anchored the mile re-
lay team, led a sweep in the 600
yard run with a time of 1:l3.5.
Rudy Hufnagel, with a. second
place in the broad jump, took sec-
ond behind Brown. Wally Swiger,
the third place finisher, joined
Brown, Hufnagel and Drysdale
on the mile relay team. Their
3:25.5 time was 0.7 seconds slow-
er than the frosh record they
hold.

Crozier Won the 100 yard run
with a 2219.6, as teammate John
Aiken raced with him to the
wire. The time was far slower
than the 2:13.3 time Richey post-
ed last week, .which tied a school
record.

Pole vaulter J eff Snyder equal-
ed his best height when he jump-
ed 13’, but it was good only for
a second place. George Pausten-
bach finished third with a vault
over the 10’9” mark. The little
Lion vaulter also did only 13’,
but won due to fewer misses at

‘ lower heights.

Other frosh point-getters were
Bart Duva, second, and Lloyd
Weston, third, in the shot put;
Vornhagen (4:21), who almost
caught Shurko (4:20) for second
in the mile, took third; and Greg
Rogers with a third place in the

Dorm “B”Teams Share Lead

Mad, Panther Clash in Deciding Tilt Tonight

by ED CONLEY

Mad House and Panther
House will meet tonight in
a game that could determine
the Dorm “B” League basket-
ball title as the season nears its
end.

Mad and Panther both show
3-0 records, well ahead of the
remaining four teams. They will
complete the season Wednesday,
but the actual ﬁnish may come
tonight.

The match was set up as re-
sult of Mad’s 49-36 triumph over
the House of Lords and Pan-
ther’s forfeit decision over Litch-
field House in play last week.

Bob Brickner led the scoring
in the Mad win, totaling 14
points. Tom Czartoryshi paced
the losers, scoring 12 points.

The only other “B” game last
week was the tightest played
-this season. Sutherland moved
into -a three-way tie for third
place in taking a sudden death
overtime Win, 44-42, over Pea-
nuits Gallery. These teams are
deadlocked in the standiings,
along with Lil-tchﬁeild, all having
one win and two losses.

This game ended in regulation
time with a 38-38 score. There
were four seconds left in the
ﬁI‘Sit overtime period and the
Peanuts led, 42-40. A missed foul

mmm ;
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE g

 

shot turned into a ﬁeld goal and
another tie. This brought about
the sudden death overtime. The
jump went to Sutherland as did

the game as a layup went
through the basket just seconds
into the ﬁnal overtime.

Leading scorers in the game
were Bruce Steigerwal (14
points) and Guy Kedzierski (13
points), both from the Peanuts
squad.

The “A” race isn't quite as
tight any longer. The season
also is closer to its ending, as
all the teams play only once
more.

The leaders played each other
‘last week, with Pleasure Paliace
surprising Stratford House, 51-
36, taking sole posession of the
‘top spot. Before the game, Strat-
fo-rd had been leading the league
offensively and was second on
defense and the match looked
like it would be much closer.

Gary ‘Cramer led the Palace
with 15 points. Bill Allen follow-
ed his teammate, coming up

Both teams won their next
game. The Palaces 60-27 humili-
ation of Hawthorne House clinch-
ed a tie for the title. Straitford
still has some hope as they were
awarded a forfeit decision over
Random House and remain one
game off the pace.

In other games last week, the

Playboys Penthouse seemed to
have started a week late as they
showed the strongest punch,

winning two games by great
margins.

 

   

They rolled over Random‘ 
House, 60-35, in a tilt that saw “f
Random never come close to the 51%

victors, despite Ray Cook's 17

point performance. John Barry 
also tossed in 17 points for the 

Playboys,

The other win was just about fl

the same story. Keyisitone House
was crushed, losing to the P[Iay-
boys, 67-25.

This evened Playboys record
at 2-2 and moved them into third
place in the “A” chase. They
didn’t even come near victory
in their ﬁrst week of play.
