   SG Bill Urges Extension

Of Fee To Grad Students

(See Ed.t'torial—Page~ 4)

By DAN BOOKER.

If the “proper authorities” ap-
prove the latest measure pass-
ed by Student Government (SG),
full-time ‘graduate students will
begin paying a ﬁve dollar activ-
ities fee identical to the one pre-
sently paid by undergraduates.
The bill explains that its pur-
pose is to remove the inequities
of graduate students being al-

_lowed to participate in activities

and events funded by the Stu-

dent Activities Fee.

The bill authorizes SG President
Ralph Manning and two senators
to petition Helen P. Rush, dean
of student affairs, to act for es-
tablishment of the graduate ac-
tivities fee. The ﬁnal decision on
the matter must be made by the
Board of Trustees.‘ No denﬁnite
indication was given as to how

soon the extended activities fee’

could go into effect, but the most
There were only two “nay”
votes on the motion, but six of
the senators abstained. These ab-
stainances were probably ex-

plained by Sen. Abe Singer’s.

The William Pitt Debating Union
(WPDU) will sponsor its Second
Annual Parliamentary Debating
Tournament today beginning at
5 p.m. and tomorrow at 10 a.m.,
1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. in the
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium

The debates will follow the

Oxford Debating Union style, in’
which government side defends. ~

the resolution, and the opposing
side opposes it; Heckling from the
audience is also permitted.

Topics will range from the
American position in Vietnam to
the relative merits of various con-
traceptive techniques.

American schools that will be

represented include Harvard, Pitt,-

Old Dominion, and Fordham

(winner of the ﬁrst Pitt Parlia-'

mentary). Canadian schools
which also plan to attend -are
St. Patrick’s College of Ottawa,
McGill University of Montreal,
University of Toronto, and the
University of Waterloo. ,

All students and faculty of the

University are invited to attend.

this?” Singer wondered whether
SG, which has no graduate rep-
resentatives, couldfairly pass a
bill aﬁecting graduate students.
Dave Hein, sponsor of the bill,
countered that the bill’s only in-
tention is to relate student opin-
ion on the issue and prompt in-
vestigation.

Sen. Terry Hyman proposed an
amendment to the bill that would
propose only a. three dollar ac-
tivities fce. This was called for,
said Hyman in the Wednesday
evening meeting, because grad-
uate students do not participate
in many activities supported by
the present activities fee (the
Pitt News, the Ski Club, etc.).

SG Vice-president’ Howard Ain-
isman explained, however, that
graduate students may partici-
pate in these activities but may
not hold offices. He also explain-

ed that graduate organizations,

would then be eligible to apply
for funds from the Student Ac-
tivities Fee. John Loch, director
of the Student Union and SG ad-
visor, noted that several grad-
uate organizations had applied
for money in the past but there
were no funds available.

With» the approximately 3,000

full-time graduate students pay-
ing "a ﬁve dollar fee, the entire
intake of the Student Activities
Fee would be increased by $15,-
000 to a total of about $40,000.
Allocation requests for this term
totaled almost $45,000 and only
$32,000 were available for allo-
cation. (There was a surplus of
$7,000 from last year.)

Bill Cabin, a member of the
Student Activities Fee Allocation

Committee, said that this com- .

mittee had discussed extension

of the fee to graduate and part-
time students,- but that they had
not agreed on any deﬁnite pro-
.posals. Cabin noted, “There are
structural aspects of student af-
fairs that would inhibit graduate
participation. For instance, grad-
uate students cannot presently
serve in SG and this is a crucial
area.”

Graduate students also do not
serve on the Allocation Commit-
tee. President Manning predicted
that this surely would be
changed if a graduate activities
fee were initiated.

Shapp Says ‘No’ To  
Less Out-of—State Fees:
‘State Students First’

By PAUL YEAGER

When asked if he would lower
out-of-state students tuition costs
at the Wednesday ‘forum, Milton
J. Shapp, Pennsylvania’s guberna-
torial candidate, answered with
an emphatic, “No.” “We must
get Pennsylvania students in col-
lege ﬁrst,” he stated. This was
one of the various questions
posed to candidate Shapp.

He clearly expressed that a re-
duction. in out-of-state student
tuition costs would not be in-

eSGSpiritAwardCompetition
OpenswithWeekend]udging

By BERNI McLEOD

Now is the time for all good
sorority, fraternity, dorm and or-
ganization members to cheer
themselves at rallies and games.
The 1966-67 Student Government
(SG) Spirit Award Competition
is on. ‘

The contest is open to all groups
and organizations who register
today and tomorrowiat the SU
Desk. A registration fee of $3
will be billed at a later date.

All groups in the competition
ﬁve will be entered under one of
categories: men’s fraternities,
women’s sororities, men’s dormi‘-
tories, women’s ‘dormitories, and
organizations. All judging will
be done within categories to in-
sure fair competition.

Peggy Jo Timko and Art Co-
hen, this year’s Spirit Award co-
chairmen, have outlined the two
classiﬁcations for scoring: a group
will be scored on a three-point
system for its banners or decora-

tions, based on the originality
and theme. Groups will also be
scored on a three point system
for their participation at pep
rallies and games. At such events
judges will watch for attendance,
spirit, and the quality of the
identiﬁcation banners carried.

Three judges, two of_ which
will be students, are to decide
the winners for every event or
banner contest. Each week new
judges will be appointed by the
Spirit Award Committee.

“We are thinking of choosing
SG senators for the judges,” said
Miss Timko. “Most important,
though, we want to ﬁnd people
who will represent many student
interests: dorm residents, com-
muters, fraternity members and
independents.”

This weekend the competition
will begin with a judging of ban-
ners hung in the Towers, dormi-
tory doors, and spirit at the
game.

Colodny Compares Spain 81 Viet S

' By FRAN GLICKSMAN
The “true origins of the ﬁght-

ing in Vietnam” were a spon-

taneous reaction of the peasants
to ‘the harsh measures of the
Diem Regime, says Dr. Robert
Colodny, associate professor of
history. “The political visions of
our country is being warped and
distorted by concealing this,” con-
tinued Colodny.

Colodny related these thoughts
while speaking informally on
“Vietnam and Spain: An Histor-
ical Perspective,” Wednesday eve-
ning at Hawthorne House. The
professor attended to_ draw com-
parisons between the Spanish
Civil War and the conﬂict in
Vietnam.

The crux of the Spanish prob-
lem was the lack of land, says
Colodny. Whoever controls the
land of Spain controls Spain. Dr.‘

olodny emphasized the diffi-
 of‘~ ” ng-._America‘_in feek

ways been enough land in Amer-
ica. This is not [so in Spain. The
peasants were the bulk of pow-
er in the Spanish conﬂict. The
Spanish tried to distribute the
land saying that it was a crusade
against Communism. The peas-
ants revolted against this aggrari-
an reform.

Similarly, the violence in Viet-
nam grows out of the desire of
the peasant to own land. The

-problem of land which relates

the Spanish Civil War and the
war in Vietnam is only one as-
pect.

“Involvement in civil war with

cluded in his “free education 7
program.” He felt that out-of— st
state students would attend the y .
University despite no reduction __'
in their tuition.
However, he did emphasize his 
free education program for Penn-- 
sylvania. He brought out that -H .
only 36 per cent of Pennsyl- "W ‘
vania’s high school graduates go .
to college compared to the na- 
tional average of 56 per cent.
Shapp attributed this situation to
the high cost of education in_ ..
Pennsylvania. He felt that his ~
program will remedy this prob- 
lem. He advocates borrowing
money from Pennsylvania banks i_ ,
and using it for all higher edu-_ _."_
tional expenses. The 'money—- 6
would then be repaid from state
taxes. “Education is not a cost. »
It is an investment,” Shapp 
stated. Although his program -A f
might mean an increase in state to
taxes, Shapp sees it as the an-
swer to Pennsylvania’s higher
educational dilemma." _ ,
The role of state - appointedg:
trustees in the operation of the ’
University was questioned after” . 
the forum. Shapp viewed their __
function as only -in an advisory ,_ "
capacity. He also discussed a,
council of higher education that
would allocate state funds to the‘...

trustees would be completely.‘
free in the application of these

funds and that there would be 
no state appointments to the too." ,-

tees would have full control of _ A
this function. “

Shapp was also asked to com-{
ment on the subject of academic E
freedom on college campuses. “I .
for one encourage academic free-' A S
dom on all levels,’’ he declared. .7
He observed that people who 
try to restrict free speach on
campus underrate the abilities of
students, leading to such things_
as book burning. ’ I

 
   
        
      
        
     
       
     
 
 
  
        
            
 
     
 
      
     
   
     
          
     
 
  

Shapp considered that his pro-
posed educational program will,‘
beneﬁt the University of Pitts-
burgh, even though he has madej
no provisions to aid out-of-state,
students.

Cooperative Gr

ad Program

 

In Religion Begins Next Fall

 Next "fall the University

I and the Pittsburgh Theolog-
ical "Seminary will begin a
-‘Cooperative Graduate Pro-
Iigram in the Study of Reli-
xitgion. The first of its kind in
ffthis area, the program will
lead to the doctor, of philoso-
;__phy degree. A _
it Announcement of thejoint ven-
'ture in graduate education was
made by Acting Chancellor Da-
‘vid H. Kurtzman and by Semin-
Vary President Donald G.‘ Miller.
The purpose of the program
will be to train religion scholars
"for university teaching, the min-

‘ istry, social work and related

ﬁelds. The program will not be
directed toward any particular
religious doctrine or affiliation,

ﬁbut will deal objectively with
I‘ the Various literary historical, so-

cial and philosophical manifesta-
tions of religion in human life.

 Under the program, the Sem-

inary will provide instruction in
such traditional areas as theolo-
gy, history of relations and studies
of scriptural texts; the University
will offer related courses in an-
thropology, classics, history, philo-
sophy, psychology, sociology and
other academic ﬁelds.

In addition to the existing aca-
demic resources of the two in-

stitutions Jewish, Roman Catho- '

lie and Eastern Orthodox re-
cources will be drawn upon as
fully as possible in order to pro-
vide the program with the great-
est poasible breadth and balance.
An effort also will be made to
expand the institutions’ capabil-
ities for teaching and study of
non-Western religions.

The program will be run by
a nine-man joint commitee con-
sising of four members from the

Seminar and five from the Uni-

versity under the chairmanship
of Dr. Walter H. Evert, associate
dean of the Humanities. It would
function similar to a department

in the Division of Humanities.
Persons with a theological de-

-gree, a suitable master's’ degree,

or equivalent training would be
eligible for the program.

Such recent developments as
the Vatican Council, the partici-
pation of religious communities

‘in the civil rights movement, and

the inﬂuence of religious opinion
on many matters of important
public policy illustrate the his-
torical influence of religion on
both individual consciences and
the policies of great nation-states.

“The major importance of the
program,” the joint announce-
ment added, “would be its re-
sumption of active inquiry in an
area of fundamental cultural sig-
niﬁcance . . . which once com-
manded the attention of leading
scholars in a wide spectrum of
disciplines but which, for a vari-
ety of reasons, has been virtually
ignored- in all but the leading
secular universities for the past
half century.”

A Liberal Arts Cabinet Plans

l‘F-ree Elective’ Courses

if ' - The Liberal Arts Cabinet met
‘Tuesday to discuss a projected
 liberal arts course evaluation and

a proposed “free electives” ‘plan.
"Also, a coffee hour with Dr.
James Kehl, dean of the School
_of Liberal Arts, was announced
for Tuesday at 3 p.m. in Dining

Room B SU.
A pilot study will be conduct-

... ed for the course evaluation in
V two weeks. A preparatory ques-
 tionnaire will be drawn up and

the students of several selected

I -» classes will be asked to complete
 an evaluation of the respective
‘g courses.

The questionnaire will then be
reﬁned and should be ready for
distribution classes by the mid-
dle of March. The permission of

, each course’s instructor will be a
 ' prerequisite for the distribution
 I of" the questionnaire.

The free elective plan was orig-

_ inally constructed as follows;

‘Any student at the sophomore

‘ted to take four courses in his
{college career on a pass or fail

 

basis, in lieu of a ‘letter grade.
No free elective could be used
in the students’ major ﬁeld, or as
a prerequisite for another course.
Instructors would not know which
students were taking a- course
for pass or fail, but would send
a letter grade for all students to
Student Records, where a D or
better would be recorded as a P.
F’s will be recorded as such.
Free elective ‘courses would‘not
count for QPA but would count
towards distribution. A

After a preliminary discussion
with several department heads.
the Cabinet agreed to consider
the following modifications:

A “P” grade would necessitate a
C or better, with a D or F being
recorded as an ’F. Each depart-
ment would determine which
courses to offer as a free elec-
tive and a certain percentage of
the usual class size would be
permitted to enroll as pass or
fail students. Also, the number
of courses in four years would be

reduced to two.

Temporary
Recognition

The Recognitions Committee of
the University met Wednesday
and granted temporary reco-gni-
tion to the Hill Education Proj-
ect and the Commuter Associa-
tion. '

To obtain temporary recogni-
tion, a group must_ have the sup-
port of the Dean of Student Af-
fairs and must present complete
credentials to the Recognitions
Committe. A report is then sent
to the Dean, who reviews the
organization and may grant 
permanent recognition. -

Once given permanent- recog-
nition, an organization is under
the supervision of Student Gov-

‘erment. The Recofnitions Com-

mittee also reviews all groups

Symphony Previews

By ADRIENNE MILLER

In keeping with the overall
campus mood, at presenta func-
tion of the trimesters first hour-
ly examinations, the theme of
this week’s Pittsburgh Symphony
Concert is death, coupled with
the hope of resurrection.

The program consists of two
works, Bach’s Canatata No. 53;
and Gustav Mahler’s Ressurec-
tion Symphony. Bo-th the Cantata
and the Symphony are products
of their composer's comptempla-
tion of death and transﬁguration.

The Bach can be compared to-
a poem, and the Mahler to a
novel, both dealing with the
same subject, death, and arriving
at the same conclusion, resurrec-
tion.

The cantata is very short, re-
quires a very hmall orchestra and
only one vocal soloist. In con-
trast, Mahler’s Resurrection Sym-
phony, his most popular and fre-
quent performed work, consists
o-f ﬁve movements. It demands a
huge orchestra, two vocal soloist,
and a full choir.

Bach’s cantata concludes with
angel voices singing of the “pas-
ture of heaven,” which awaits
the departed, while Mahler’s sym-
phony closes with a powerful as-
surance of eternal life._

Mahler’s life is well document-

‘ed. In a letter written after the

death of his good friend and col-
league Hans van Buelow, he ex-
plained the origin of his inspira-
tion.

— First, Mahler tells‘ of his strug-.

gle to complete the Second Sym-
phony. “For the last movement
of my Second symphony I search-
ed the entire world of literature,
including the Bible, to ﬁnd an

 

inspirational text.” But he found
nothing.

“It was at this time,” he con-
tinues, “that Buelow died and I
attended the memorial services
here in Hamburg. The mood in
which I was sitting (in Church)

and thinking of the departed one

was very much in the spirit of I

the work which I carried inside
of me. At this point, the choir
from the organ loft into-ned the
Klopstode Chorale ’Aufersteh’n!
(Rise Again.) Like lightening this
hit me; everything became clear
before my soul! What I had ex-
perienced on this day, I now had
to ‘create in tones.”

Thus came the inspiration for

  Bach, Mahler Featured Lu:

the ﬁnale, the most crucial part

of the symphony.

Mahler is thought of as one of.
the most important composers of
the 20th Century. After the Aus-
trians were liberated from the
Nazis they reinstalled Rodin’s
bronze bust of Mahler, and per-
formed the Ressurection Sym-
phony as a symbol of their free-
dom.

Cathedral Poets I I

By LESLIE HART
[Miss Hart is Editor of
“Ideas and Figures,”
the I campus literary magazine.
An “accident of place," writes
Dr. Lawrence Lee in his intro-
duction to Cathedral Poet I, is
responsible for the title. It is an
the poetry and
the architecture are almost» equal-
ly bad. Ordinarily, it would be a
risky business to lump 31 poets
together under a common pur-

I pose, but in this case, the group-

ing is handsomely done.

. Cathedral Poets I opens with
ten translations of Chinese poems
by Shih-Chuan Chen. Reading
on, one is nagged by the sus-
picion that the rest of the book,
too, is in translation and has
lost all its insides as a result:
Sharapan, Hayes, Dippold, Good-
fellow, Meanor, Leax, McCague,
Brown, Jones, Lewin, Booth, Lee
—it would be hard to separate
the immaculately bad from the
merely incompetent.

These poets suffer from some
death of the senses: they do not
hear, touch, see at all, and they
read like an anthology of the
better high school poets of 1925,
printed on excellent paper. The
grasp of technique- is something
admirable, the diction passable,
but after a time I -am no longer
interested in watching these pleas-
ant people walk their feelings up
and down. Nothing happens. We
have read it all before: Ann
Jones’ tiny conceit about spar-
rows, Sarah Meanor’s lines to
“Death and Ecstacy” and “Unsel-
ﬁsh Love,” Magner’s totally tire-
some and predictable poem to
the late -President.

Dr. Lee does his best work
when he is translating someone
else. When he is on his own, we
get a Cook's Tour of Athens. I
never fail to be amazed at the
steely determination of the sec-
ond-rate Western mind to graft

    

 

itself, once and for all, onto the
Parthenon. And I have nothing
but impatience for this kind of
phony electicism: none of those

Lord knows, there are enough of
them—believe in it. The images
do not trouble their thoughts, or
keep them up nights, or help
them to convince us that they
can write.

I am pleased to see that Kons-
tantius Lardas, who is sporadical-
ly one of the best in this com-
pany, does not ﬁnd it necessary
to ﬁre Zeus, Apollos, and the
Cyclades at me every third line.
The better things in the book are:
McKinnie’s “Midas” and “Let Me
Confuse Myself with Music”; one
or two of the images and the
end line of O’Keefe’s “Fisher-
man”; passages from Schmidt;
parts of “The Orchard,” by Eben
Bass, though it is too long and
smells of syrup; four or ﬁve
lines out of the total of 98 that
make up Sydorick’s But as the
Sun; whole stanzas of Walter
Leuba; and one short, astringent
poem with a cutting edge —-
Hazo’s “Gat-Sing."

All are poisoned in some de-
gree by the obvious image, the
banal and easy emotion, the com-
plete absence of poetic muscle
and tooth that infects this book
like dropsy.
~ I do not know what is respon-
sible for this impotence. In cases
like Meanor, Hayes, -Lee and com-
pany, I suspect it is a killing
dose of Emily Dickinson. In the
rest, I see everywhere the facet
of the versifying club woman: no
evidence of a ruling passion.‘ No
rudeness, no sharp angles, and
nothing—but nothing——improper.
The best think I’ can say about it
is that it isn’t obscure. The only
real hope I have is for the sin-
gle undergraduate contributor,
‘Dennis MOPl_t§,> who is young and

may grow out of it.

Editor, Pitt News: 0 g

I Although we cannot afford to
-purchase a full-page ad_ in the
4Pitt News to express our opin-
ions on the MIJC literature dis-
tribution rules, we think it ap-
propriate that this letter appear
in the newspaper.

We support the forceful ‘stand
"taken by the Pitt News. We ‘say
let’ the men in the dorms, through
their elected representatives in
VMDC, decide whether or not they
-wish to have literature distri-
buted under their doors. What-

ever is their decision, we support
it.

i This is NOT a question of
' freedom of speech. Each of us
unequivocally believes that free-
dom of speech must not be sup-
.pressed, especially at a Universi-
:ty, However, this is a POLITIC-
{AL ISSUE, not a question of
freedom.

‘ In search of an issue, any is-
sue, certain factions on this cam-
lpus have tried unceasingly to in-
crease their political stature by
.- rumping up the MDC rules or
_.any other baseless issue. In the
last SG election, these people
broke the rules deliberately, by
their own admission,'just to cre-
ifate an artiﬁcial issue.

Let us, in agreement with the
_:.Pitt News, call “a spade a spade.”
_The Pitt ‘Progressive Party, the
' rogressive Union, or the Liberal
Union .(by whichever name‘ they
0 known presently), has duped
‘roth students and faculty into
iibelieving that the MDC rules rep-
 esent a true “cause ce1ebre.”
 DO NOT. ,
.Why does the suddenly-active
z-faculty not lend its support to
.th‘_e Student Government and the
‘Student Union Board in their ef-
_ orts to obtain a CONSTRUCT-
TIVE GOAL — a new Student

rWhére were these faculty mem-
beifs this past summer when the

A‘ The dialogue at a Wednesday’s Student Government (SG) meeting
linpoints a gnawing problem of student life-—the role of the graduate stu-
ent in campus activities. The discussion at the Senate meeting helped to
larify what had long been a nebulous situation.
.A The question of graduate students arose during the debate over in-
Vluding full-time gra.duate students in the Student Activities Fee. The bill
s ‘passed recommended that each graduate students pay a $5 per term fee.
 do full-time undergraduates. ' A

a It became clear that graduate students now benefit from the Activi-
jties Fee although they do not contribute to their support. For example the
;_Student Union Board (SUB) offer many programs that are either directly
iper indirectly subsidized by Activities’ Fee Funds.‘

 The extra monies granted to SUB have permitted them to bring out-
-{standing speakers such as Martin Luther King to campus and provideifree
fentertainment. such as the Back Porch Majority ‘Concert. The Weekly Stu-
__»dent Union Board film series serves as another example. All these activi-
I ties are open to graduate students at the University. Moreover, these pro-
grams will inevitably improve with the additional funds from the graduate

students. It will mean an approximate $15,000 increase, leaving $40,000
per term to be allocated, .
But it was argued that the majority of organizations which receive

_ funds from the Fee do not have graduate student members and can in no

way benefit graduate students. This is not ‘the case. A graduate student
interested in skiing or folk dancing can join groups organized around these
activities. Graduate students have long been contributors to the various
publications. The only stipulation has been that officers o-r editors of these
organizations should be undergraduates.-

For several years now separate graduate organizations have tried to
get started on campus. Most of them have fallen on their face. With the
increased monies, it is a possibility that the Activities Fee Allocations

Committee could give these groups some substantial financial support. Also,

{Letters to the Editor

If these faculty members and
students are truly concerned with
the welfare of the ‘student body,
they will not waste their time
(and money) on the trumped-up
issue of minor factions whose
true “cause” is the betterment of
their political position.

Let us hear no more from this
publicity-hungry fringe element
of our campus. You have beaten
the proverbial horse to death.
We have more issues with which
to be concerned.

We also urge MDC to act, and S

to act in the interest of the men
whom they duly represent. We
affirm that it is solely the right

‘of MDC to decide this question.

I would like to clarify two
minor points from my statement
to the Pitt News that appeared
in last Monday’s edition. First
PPP’s alternative proposal was
initially presented at the student
subcommittee meeting but was
not made public until after the
subcommittee had concluded
their open hearings. Second, there
were varying sentiments within
the subcommittee concerning the
rules above the lobby and lVlDC
was informally asked to examine
them. However, they were retain-.
ed by the subcommittee.

Student Attacks

OpenDistribution

Editor, Pitt N ews:

If MDC acts to allow free dis-
tribution of literature it will be
a direct and unmitigated inva-
sion of privacy. The dorms are
supposed to‘ be the student's
HOME, and just as off-campus
students, they should have per-
sonal selectivity in determining
what literature enters, by PICK-
ING IT- UP THEMSELVES. The
Towers distribution booth is the
ONLY answer. I have lived in
the dorms and know I wouldn’t
want a foot of TRASH from frats

and political candidates under

my door.

Carefully examining who the
backers of this bill are, we ﬁnd
they are the perennial political
candiates or organization heads
currently in membership drives.
All of these people would gain
personal beneﬁts or FEATHERS
IN THEIR CAPS if this INTRU-
SION of PRIVACY is allowed.

Irate,

In the advertisement, “We Urge

“We the undersigned, urge the
Men’s Dormitory Council to real-

Student Asks For
Brief Literature

Editor, Pitt News:

Walking through the quadran-
gle yesterday, I noticed a mimeo—
graphed handbill recommending
that Pitt students should demon-
strate “Because Mr. Humphrey
represents the Johnson Adminis-
tration and its‘ War in Vietnam

the organization’s grounds for
student involvement.

A full-page advertisement in
Monday’s Pitt News urged modi-
ﬁcation of MDC regulations, ad-

vocating comparatively concrete ,

and well-meaning distribution

proceedures. This may result in '

renewed literature distribution in
the dormitories.

My three-year tenure here has
convinced ; me that Pitt’s atmos-
phere of mild student involve-

pressure require that when the.

V In other Words, this is a plea
to campus organizations asking

TERRY HYMAN
Chairman, SG Constitution Committee

Now is the time for Pitt students to throw off the stigma of
apathy. Now is the time for Pitt students to stop letting the admin-
istration completely run their lives. Each one of you has some com-
plaint about Pitt, yet because you feel these complaints are not im-
portant enough, to express, or because you feel that your opinion will
have no effect, you let them slide. There is no firm student opinion!

There is no student influence on policy decisions! There is only a ‘
Vote for the new constitution and you have

voiceless student body.

an effective Student Government to speak for you. Whether you want
new washing machines in the laundry room or thelowering of out-of-
state tuition, a vote for the new constitution provides a better SG
to act for you. Thus, if youlcare about yourself and Pitt, you must

“vote for the proposed SG constitution.

OLD
1. A advisory committee of
heads of major organizations (the

Student Affairs Committee) as‘

prime communicator of student
opinion. This means 11 different
people discussing students’ prob-
lems.

2. Vice-presidents of major stu-
dent organizations are members
of the Senate. This means people

. elected by only a portion of -the

student body have an equal vote
as those who are elected by all
students. .

3. No direct communication be-
tween other organizations and
SG. This means SG is unaware
of the activities and opinions of
other organizations.

4. “The exercise of the author-
ity granted the Student Govern-
ment by this Constitution’ is sub-
ject to the approval of the_Dean
of Student Affairs.

5. No method of appeal for
students. I

NEW

1. The Student Government
shall be the only representative
body of all students of the Oak-
land campus of the University of
Pittsburgh.” This means one
strong-expression of student opin
ion. ,

2. All senators are elected di-
rectly by students. This means
fair representation of ' all stu-
dents.

3. The formation of Va Presi-
dent’s Council of the Vice-presi-
dents of major organizations to
meet twice a month. The forma-
tion of a General Assembly of
all recognized organizations to

discuss student problems. This ‘
means a Student Government .

that is constantly aware of stu-
dents’ opinions and thus able to
express them more strongly.

4. Student Government is to

“provide for the structure of stu- ‘

dent affairs.” This means stu-
dents, not administrators will
govern student affairs.

5. Establishes a University Re-
view Board consisting of three
students, three administrators,
and three faculty members who
will review disciplinary cases of
students. It will also decide
whether SG has acted within its
constitutional limits,’ so that
there will be no “tyranny of Stu-
dent Government.”

ment Constitution. The first half of the proposal appeared in Wednes-

day's edition of the Pitt News.)

Programs of National

Significance

Creating secure communications systems and equip-
ments unknown anywhere else. This is the mission of
the National Security Agency—a mission which in
turn‘ creates problems of a high order of difficulty,
requiring an uncommon. amount of ingenuity.

There is no other organization like it. . . no other
organization doing the same important work, ‘or offer-
ing‘ the same wealth of opportunity for imaginative
graduates in mathematics orthe engineering sciences.

A separate agency operating within the defense
establishment, NSA has a critical requirement for:

ENGINEERS. To carry out basic and’ applied re-
search, design, development, testing and evaluation
of large-scale cryptocommunlcations and EDP sys-_

s tems. Engineers may also participate in related

studies of electromagnetic propagation, upper atmos-
phere phenomena, super-conductivity and cryogenics
using thelatest equipment for advanced research
within the Agency's fully instrumented laboratories.
Career programs are designed to develop the pro-

fessional engineerfor afull and satisfying future in

research or management.

MATHEMATICIAMS. To define, formulate and solve
complex communications—related problems in sup-
port of the NSA..mission. Statistical mathematics,
matrix algebra, finite fields, probability, combinatorial~
analysis, programming and symbolic logic are but a
few of the tools applied by Agency mathematicians.

we on

By ROY JACOBS

Today, for the first time
in two years, the University
will field a freshman foot-
ball team. Forty— one Cubs
meet the Little Mountaineers
of West Virginia this afternoon
at Morgantown.

The Cubs hold § 21-11-2 edge
in the series which dates back
to 1920, but this year’s -game
matches up Dave Hart’s ﬁrst
group of recruits with Mountain-

dividual practice, and it is only
in the last week and a half that
coach Steve Petro has been able
to work with them as a unit.

“They’ve improved,” said ‘Pe-
tro, “but it’s still not the team
we want ready.” The team work-
ed on ironing out kinks Wednes-
day and spent Thursday getting
its timing down.

West Virginia, on the other
hand, practices an hour a day
and should be well drilled for
the Cubs. In addition, the Lit-
tle Mountaineers have already
played one game and have two
weeks to correct any mistakes
that resulted.

of Garland Hudson"s arm. How-
ever, Hudson is nursing an ankle
injury and may not see action
today. John Racin of Morgantown
will probably replace him.

The Cubs have a quarterback
problem, too. Petro can’t decide
which one to use. He indicated
he might not decide until this
morning. between Frank Gustine,
Ray Reppert, Jeff Barr, Chuck
Winters, and George Medich.
~ Petro gives‘ a frank appraisal
of his team. “I’m pressed not
only with the large numbers,‘ but
especially with the quality. Our
ends and backs look especially
strong. I would say we lack some-
what in interior lineman, but
overall I’m optimistic.” He has
reason to be. WVU list 18 players
going both ways, including only
eight interior linemen. A

There is one other factor to
be considered in today’s contest
—revenge. Not only is this 'a
great rivalry, but last Saturday
the Panthers beat their varsity.

“They’re deﬁnitely out for us,”
said Petro. “They go to West
Virginia just to beat Pitt. You

. can see the sign on the dressing

room door.” .
It could be the Cubs are a lit-
tle hungry, too. .

Crippled But Ready,
Booters Meet Rockets

Last Week the fres-hmen soccer team traveled to Slip-
pery Rock. They came home with six walking wounded.
This week the varsity has reversed the procedure. They

don’t visit the Rockets until to-
morrow, and they /are already
composed of walking wounded.

Three more players have been
added to the casualty list this
week. Center fullback Jim Sny-
der has a badly swollen foot,
right halfback A1 Traunsteiner
also has a foot injury, and left
wing Sal Tavares has shin splints.

This is on top of an injury
list that already includes Bill
Zurzola, Terry Weiler, Pete Sny-
der, and others.

But, head coach Leo Bemis ex-
pects everyone but Jim Snyder
to be ready to go at the Rockets.
And Snyder vows that he’ll play
too, if he can get his shoe on

over the swelling.

If Snyder isn’t ready, Bemis
has been experimenting with
two possible ideas for replacing
him. The ﬁrst, consists of switch-
ing sophomore center halfback
Dave Shimpeno to Snyder’s spot

GYMNASTICS STARTS
Anyone interested in joining
the gymnastics team should
contact Warren Neiger. This

— includes freshmen or upper-

classmen. Practice has already
started. Also, a, manager is
needed.

and then using either Zurzola or
Gary Foertsch at halfback.

The other alternative is to
switch Art Richardson from right
to center fullback, and replace
him with either Zurzola or sopho-
more Mike Schalk. Bemis is con-
sidering both, but, as of now, he
is favoring moving back Shim-
peno.

In Slippery Rock, the booters
will be up against a team that is
not to be taken lightly. In their
opening game, they defeated
Grove City, a team that tied Pitt
last year, and ended the Grovers’
11 game unbeaten streak. Their
only loss has been to Denison, a
team that played Michigan State
even for three quarters.

Challenge  
Grove City

Fresh from a victory over Gan-
non College, the cross-country
team faces Grove City tomorrow

at 11 a.m. in “an, effort to break-

the Schenley Park course rec-

ord,” according to coach Jim.

Banner.

» Coach Banner ‘feels the boys
are in top physical shape and is

' looking forward to a close meet.

In the past, Grove City has had
one of the better teams in the
country and usually possess one
or two potential All-Americans.

The team’s spirit is running
high after Frank Handelman’s
record breaking time last week.

iBein Grady

Relieved of

Swim Job

Ben Grady has been relieved of
his duties as swimming coach
due to health reasons. Appoint-
ed as interim varsity coach has
been Jerry Snyder.

Snyder, a native of Reading,
Pa., graduated from West Chester
State College in 1965. He re-
ceived his Masters in Education
from Pitt in August. Until now,
Snyder has been serving as an
aquatics instructor.

Grady came to Pitt as swim-
ming coach in 1939. Under Grady
the -merman won eight Eastern
titles, the last coming in 1959.
But since then his teams stag-
nated, winning six meets and
losing 14 in the past two seasons.

May try something different.

DAVE HART
Game means “something special.”

Elias,HartRe united
For Panther Clash

By GEORGE LIES
It doesn’t take much to. psych-up Dave Hart, but this
one is special. The Panthers play Navy tomorrow at the
Stadium, and it’s Hart’s homecoming. Game time is 1:30
p.m. ‘ ‘

“This game means something special to me," Hart said. “And I
would like very much to win it.”

After two years as- an assistant under coach Bob Elias of the
Academy, Hart will try‘ to smite the hand which gave him his chance.
“I have at great respect for coach Elias and think he’ll probably come
up with something out of the ordinary for the -game since we've
coached together," said Hart.

From Navy. Hart br0l1ght‘with him coaches Bill, Neal and Jim
Royer. What Hart left behind, however, could return the smite.

Hartrecruited for Navy and two boys he left behind were John A

Cartwright and Roger Lammers. After missing two games5 due to
-an injury, Cartwright returned with two touchdown passes in a losing
cause to Syracuse last Saturday.

Coach Steve Petro, who scouted Navy, considers Cartwright as
50 per cent of their offense. “He. rLms option keepers, passes off

A sweeps, and can cut on a dime,” ‘Petra said. Besides rushing for a

4.3 average, Cartwright has completed 29 of 58 passes for 350 yards.

Lammers, the second Hart recruit, is rated as the best of Navy's
defensive halfbuacks. Last year when Navy shutout the Panthers,
12-0, Lammers was injured and did not play. Lammers could be a
thorn in the side of Panther quarterback Ed James, who has thrown
six interceptions. “He does an outstanding job of coming up on runs
or staying back to cover the ﬂat and wing passes,” said his coach.

Navy's one win in four games came against Boston College. “Mis-
takes cost Navy to lose the three. games that they did,” said scout
Petro. “I hope they make them againstus.”

Although the Panthers won last Saturday against rival West Vir-T
ginia, Hart felt they too made. mistakes. “We didn't expect to play
well with three sophomore linebackers,” he said. “But our tackles
were trapped too consistently to please us (coaches). Our line held,
but they weren't diggin7 in too well at the end against West Virginia.”

Against the Mountaineers, the defense had to stop All-American
candidate Garrett Ford. Against Navy, they meet halfback Terry Mur-
ray. Murray, who Elias feels “ﬁnds daylight where there is none,”
averages 3.9 yards per carry. ,

Injuries have played an important role in Hart's first season
thus far. Middle linebacker Jim Flanigan, missed greatly last week,
may see full time duty tomorrow. Tailback Dewey Chester will also
see action while defensive tackle Greg Keller may give his bad
shoulder a try. Skip Orszulak, who has a fractured ﬁnger, will miss
at least two more games. _ ,

“We miss Orszulak more than people think,” Hart said. “He can;

receive the football real good, he has real good speed and can rim

patterns well. He is also a good rtmner.”

Family ties run close between two coaches. It ranges from Hart's
son, Dave, who lives at Elias’ home and dates Elias’ daughter, Candy,
to their wives who are very much looking forward to this reunion.
A reunion which is secondary, however, to the “Big Game” tomorrow.
