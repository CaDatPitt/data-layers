NEW YORK — Tray Woodall and La-
mar.Patterson outscored all of their
teammates combined.

But it wasn’t those other players’
offensive contributions that made the
difference for the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team Sunday aﬁernoon at Madi-
son Square Garden in New York City.

Leading by three at halftime, the
Panthers’ depth caused St. John’s to
struggle on offense, which allowed
No. 20 Pittto pull away from the Red
Storm inthe second half and earn an
important 63-47 victory. The win en-
sured that Pitt avoided athree-game
losing streak after it suffered defeat
in its last two contests against No. 17
Marquette and No. 25 Notre Dame.

“I think everybody strapped
down,” said Woodall, who scored
a game-high 25 points to lead the
Panthers.

St. John’s head coach Steve Lavin
likened his team’s inability to pro-
duce on offenseto inhabitingabarren
wasteland.

“We clearly were in the desert,

laboring at the offensive end of the

court,” Lavin said. I
Early on, Pitt (21—7, 9-6 Big East)
displayed energy and methodical
smoothness withthe ballas it got out
to a seven—point advantage almost
halfway through the ﬁrst period. That
energy wouldn’t last though as the

Dressed in" neon shirts that read
“Too legit to sit” with glow sticks
hanging from their necks, students
from across campus packed into the
Fitzgerald Field House this weekend,
providing the building with energy
that it hadn’t seen since before Pitt’s
basketball team moved to the Pe-
tersen Events Center in 2001. ,
They needed every iota of this col-
lective energy because they had some
dancing to do —— 24 hours worth.
The annual Pitt Dance Marathon,
which started in 2005, brought hun-
dreds of students together from 3
p.m. Saturday to 3 p.m. Sunday to

raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis

ﬁitlf llliill HE

Foundation. Coordinators of the
event say its popularity continues to
grow as the years continue.

“Over the past ﬁve years, we have
raised around $300,000 for orga-
nizations,” event coordinator Alex
Murdoch said. “If we have another
successful year here, we hope to add
to that number signiﬁcantly.”

This year PDM raised $61,872.16,
nearly doubling last year’s total. While
the event has not broken ﬁnancially
even each year — Allocations Chair
Alex Majchrzak said Student Govern-
ment Board allocated $29,630.56 to
the event this year — Murdoch said
they were focused on putting on a
successful event.

“You know we have good years
and bad ones,” he said. “We are really
trying to make this one of the best

The genre of music varied
throughout the night in an attempt
to keep the dancers on their feetwith
different periods of techno, ‘90s and
country music. The dancers them-
selves were divided into eight teams
and competed throughout the night
to bolster the energetic atmosphere.
The competitionsthatranthroughout
the night were known as the “Color
Wars,” inwhich students competed in
activities such as dancing and limbo.

This, according to another event
coordinator and junior Dave Rosen-
thal, was done to combat some dif-
ﬁculties that coincide with PDM.

Trustees
elect
general
counsel

Megan Trimble
Assistant News Editor

The position of the University’s chief
legal officer will remain among the
Jerrys.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees resolved

to elect P._]erome Richey to the posi-
tion of general counsel and relieve
Jerome “Jerry” Cochran of his dual
role as executive vice chancellor
and general counsel during its pub-
lic meeting in the Assembly Room
of the William Pitt Union on Friday
morning.

The responsibilities of the general
counsel include exercising general
oversight of the main campus’s le-
gal affairs as well as the four branch
campuses of the University. The Uni-
versity’s research integrity ofﬁcer,
12 lawyers and 10 other employees,
including three paralegals, comprise
the Office of General Counsel. The
office works to prepare and review
University contracts, represent the
University in legal proceedings and
provide legal advice among other
lega1—related matters dealing with
the University’s wide scope of activi-
ties and interests.

Former President of the Alumni
Associationjack Smith presented Co-
chran with a 225th anniversary me-
dallion for his service, and Chancellor

' Mark Nordenberg praised Cochran

for the role he played as executive
vice chancellor — the University’s
chiefbusiness officer — and general
counsel since 2004.

have competitions, step teams and other events
to keep everyone going,” Rosenthal said.

The marathon included performances by
hip-hop teams as well as a step performance by
Pitt fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha. ”

Not everyone, however, had to dance for the
full 24 hours to attend PDM. The only people
bound by the 24-hour dancing requirement in
its entirety were the dancers. “Moralers,” on
the other hand, were divided into three shifts
and danced for eight hours at a time. General
students were permitted to enter and spend
as long as they liked at PDM after paying $5 at
the door.

Participants’ dedication to dance was also
strengthened by meals available every three
hours. Dedicationwas necessary unless students
wanted to pay. Tired dancers faced a $1 ﬁne per
minute of sitting, but the majority seemed un-
willing to stop as the ﬂuorescent shirts covered
the dance ﬂoor from wall to wall.

Students came and went as they pleased,
and the student population rose and declined
throughout the night as was expected, fresh-
man Lindsay Warhola said. At about 10 p.m.,
she and some other students at PDM began to
grow weary.

“It’s around hour seven now, and most stu-
dents are getting a bit tired, but I am sure by
midnight itwillbe packed, and everyone willbe

dancing even harder,” Warhola said.

Cochran has served the University and served
it well,” Nordenberg said.

Nordenberg explained that the separation in
executive ﬁmctions will restore the University
to its standard organization structure and allow
Cochran to focus on the University’s complex
business needs and help the University “move
through the economically challenging times.”

Board Chairman Stephen R. Tritch called
for the unanimous vote that formally elected
Richey to general counsel of the University
that will take effect March 1. Richey earned
his bachelor’s degree in philosophy and his
juris doctorate with honors from Pitt before
beginning his career practicing law in private
practice. Most recently, he served as chieflegal
ofﬁcer and executive vice president of CONSOL
Energyin2009. ’

“You’re lucky, Jerry. No one is opposed,”
Tritch said, welcoming Richey to the position.

Nordenberg turned the Board’s attention
to honoring another legacy through a resolu-
tion to name the sport and ﬁtness center at the
University of Pittsburgh at Bradford the Dr.
Richard and Ruth McDowell Sport and Fitness
Center to honor the Pitt-Bradford president
emeritus and his wife. ‘

McDowell grew up in Bradford and served
as the Pitt—Bradford president from 1973 to
2002. Accepting the role of president at 29
years old, McDowell became the youngest col-
lege president in America. Saince thenhe has

“[He] is most certainly that community’s

the “scores and scores of students who have
beneﬁtted” from McDowell’s contributions.
The remainder of the hour-and-a-half
meeting included general business and what
Cochran referred to as “housekeeping mat-
ters,” which included resolutions for language

changes made to University—governing docu-

ments.
Among such documents, the Board passed

a resolution to amend articles three, four and B 
ﬁve of the bylaws of the University. The amend-  
ments were made to properly reﬂect ofﬁcer .

titles and committee names that have changed
since the documents were last amended in
2008. Other resolutions included authorizing

U certain officers to execute and sign documents

ees Committee’s mission statements.

Nordenberg issued his Report of the Chan- E

cellor and reﬂected on the culminations of Pitt’s
past and future on the University’s Feb. 28 birth-

day. He highlighted the history of research .. 
strengths and achievements and commented 
on research fellowships and scholarships held . -

by current students.

“It is inspiring to think about the work done

by countless others over the course of those

stresses presented by last year’s bomb threats
and the shooting at Western Psychiatric Insti-
tute and Clinic butwas hopeﬁil for the ﬁxture.
He cited the 26,500 applications already re-
ceived for student enrollment in the fall and a
93-percent freshman-to-sophomore retention
rate this academic year, which was the highest

 Pitt’s history.

Commenting on the ever—present issue of
state ﬁinding, Nordenberg said this year’s ﬂat

 is a change from the past two years
"’“but will still presentthe University with “real
_ challenges” as the cost of programs continues
7 to rise. '

While he said the Commonwealth is receiv-
ing a far greater return on investment through

.; the success of the University and students, Nor-
 denberg expressed gratitude for the governor’s
' proposal, which will not drastically cut funding.

Looking to federal education support, Nor-

’ denberg was less optimistic, saying that “we

are hardly in the clear,” citing the potential de-
structiveness of the federal sequester, which is
scheduled to occur March 1. The federal seques-
ter is an $85 billion reduction in defense and
domestic spending by the federal government

Also among concerns, Nordenberg said,
is the question of more aggressive taxation on

audience to not only praise theirpredecessors,

THE STAMATTACK

er education

victim to the same

disease that brought down Wall Street

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opinions Editor

Looking back to the origins of
the ﬁnancial crises, it is pain-
fully obvious that the system was
designed to fail.

The core failure was a duo-
poly between banks and rating
agencies. Before large invest-
ment banks sold their invest-
ment packages to customers,
these independent rating agen-
cies would determine the riski-
ness ofthe securities.

But because the banks paid
the agencies and because gov-
ernmentregulations forced all ‘
securities to go through these

comparisons between possible
investments impossible. Instead
of efficient allocation of capital
toward meaningful projects, the
money chased wasteful housing
developments and other faulty
ventures, and we spiraled into
recession.

This situation —— which still-

hasn’t been reformed, by the way
—- actually also forms the basis
of higher education. Arguably, it
forms the basis of $1 trillion in
student debt that today threat-
ens the economic prospects of
an entire generation. ‘
The problem stems here,
again, from misdirected incen-
tives and inaccurate (or really,
nonexisting) methods by which

in a University Senate meeting,
makes it “very difficult to see
where you stand comparative to
everyone else.” Different‘ bud-
geting practices can make the
same expenditures seem like
completely different prioriti-
zation of resources.

Given these differences, a
potential student weighing the
potential financial benefits of a
proposed tuition is in a situation
much like the lower—level inves-
tor buying complicated securi-
ties. Even when a detailed analy-
sis of the nature of the assets is
available, it is very difficult to
make a meaningful comparison
between schools.

So instead of making a deci-

rating agencies, nobody had
an incentive to actually judge '
the quality of anything. Banks
didn’t care about the integrity
of their investments, just that
they could sell their products
as AAA. Rating‘ agencies didn’t
need to do a good job because
the government guaranteed they
would have customers.

The whole'system collapsed
on itself when_ it quickly_became
apparent an AAA rating meant
nothing. It became impossible
to distinguish good investments
from bad: The simplifying and
misrepresentative rating re—y
vealed itself to mean nothing,
leaving investors only compli-
cated,mons_trous collections of"
ﬁnancial instruments incapable
of interpretation.

Institutionaglly misdirected

incentives made meaningful

colleges and universities demon-
strate how they spend money.
As highlighted in last week’s
University Times, universities
report their expenses based on
no underlying, unifying criteria.
So while Pitt says it spends
(all per student) $16,043 on
instruction, $3,662 on student

services, $21,450 on research,

$2.570 on‘pi1bl5iclservic‘e” and
$14,516 on overhead ($6,012
for academic support, $4,688
for institutional support and
$3,816 for 'operatio.n"s1: and
maintenance), it’s impossible to
compare, these ﬁgures ta) other
schools‘.

Two reporting areas in par-
ticular that differ greatly across
institutions -are information
technology and athletic ex-
penses. The whole system, as
Vice Provost David Dejong noted

sion based on -evidence and a
cost—beneﬁt comparison, a stu-
dent or family wishing to make
comparisons across schools
must consult one of roughly six
rating agencies. Using arbitrary
criteria, the colleges are ranked
on a nice, organized scale in a
method similar to the credit rat-
ing system. .

’ ' The comparisons to the world
of finance are obvious, and the
institutional effects are predict-
able. Colleges have no incentive

I to allocate their resources in a

method attractive to customers.

 Instead, theirxbiggest incentives

are to take advantage of rating

ﬂate their rating.

versities are often caught per-

forming the same deceptive tactics as the
big banks, fudging numbers (Claremont
McKenna College and Iona College) or
offering ﬁnancial incentive for students
to increase scores (Baylor University).
It’s an unfortunate situation. Just-as
the confusing regulatory framework
and bad rating systems led to misallo—

cated capital in the mid—2_0o0s, the lack.

of transparency is likely leading to the
same misallocation of resources at the
university level. After all, the lifetime
earnings of somebody with a college di-
ploma, while still higher than a worker
with only a high school diploma, have

stopped growing even as debt loads have
increased. Could it be that the current
allocation of resources is somehow off?
Is $2,750 for public service the right
amount? ‘Do we need $6,021 for institu-
tional support? ~
Nobody knows. And we aren’t even
moving in the right direction to find out.
Without the ability to make comparisons
across colleges, there is no way for mar-
ket discipline to directcolleges toward

making responsive investments. Admin-C ‘

istrators can’t even look at other schools
to see what is working and what isn’t.
The solution is simple for both the
world of ﬁnance and higher education:
regulated, uniform reporting of ﬁnancial
records. Don’t regulatethe-rating of these

systems; just open access of information.
There should exist a database of every ac-
credited institution of _higher education
that can be easily sorted by how resources
are allocated.

Very quickly, administrators and re-
searchers would get a better.sense of what
works in producing quality students. Stu-
dents could decide for themselves if they
want to go to a university focusing heavily
on instruction or institutional support.
They would also know what institutional
support means. .

But most importantly, the tyranny of
the rating agencies would be broken. No
longer lulled into security by a ranking,
all players in the system would make

r stronger. decisions about what is actu-

ally important. Provided the integrity
of reporting could be insured, it might
become harder to manipulate the system.
Differences between schools would actu-
ally represent different philosophies in
education.

The market could ﬁnally direct costs
downward and outcomes upward.

President Barack Obama has made
reporting of student outcomes a prior-
ity, promising to base federal funding
on student outcomes and cost-reduction
techniques. This will hopefully make col-
leges more responsive and efficient.

_ But to really reform high education,
universities need to open books and allow
the market to better inﬂuence outcomes.

Another home game for the wom-
en’s basketball team and another
heartbreaking loss in the ﬁnal
minutes.

The Panthers fought back from
a 15-point ﬁrst—half deﬁcit and
had the Georgetown Hoyas on the
ropes Saturday at the Petersen
Events Center. Pitt was seconds
away from breaking its 32—game
regular-season conference losing
streak. But in this game, being on
the wrong side of the score when
the clock hits zero means another
tally in the loss column.

Pitt (9-17, 0-13 Big East) dropped
its 13th-straight Big East regular-
season game Saturday in an ago-
nizing 72-70 loss to the George-
town Hoyas. Entering the game,
Pitt hoped to avenge a 69-57 loss
to Georgetown from Jan. 26 at the
Verizon Center, but the Hoyas (14-
12, 5-8 Big East) refused to let the
Panthers climb back into the game
after building an early lead.

Saturday’s game coincided with
the sixth annual Pink the Pete event,
an effort to raise money and aware-
ness for breast cancer. The Panthers
and head coach Agnus Berenato
hosted the event, in which $1 from
each $10 ticket — the price includ-
ing lunch and the game — went

toward the Pittsburgh afﬁliate of the
Susan G. Komen Fund. A season-
high 3,090 turned out for the event,
including 1,000 students who re-
ceived free pink Oakland Zoo shirts
upon entrance.

“It is a cause extremely, ex-
tremely close to my heart, and I
am very passionate about it. It just
goes to show the unbelievable im-
pact that this team has on people,”
Berenato said after the game. “And
it was a great game, we had a great
crowd. The Pitt community came
out in ﬁill force today, and it was
really great to see. I was happy the
players had the opportunity to play
in front of a crowd like that.”

Following the Pink the Pete
luncheon, the crowd ﬁlled their
seats for what turned out to be a
very entertainingbout between the
two squads. This game marks the
last time they will play each other
in the regular season as Big East
foes before Pitt transitions to the
Atlantic Coast Conference.

The gameplay started out on
a fast note, with Pitt claiming the

early advantage. A beautiful ﬁn-

ish at the basket on a 3-on-1 from
sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel
gave Pitt the abbreviated 10-9 lead
at 14:18 in the ﬁrst half.

Woodall displays leadership, guides Pitt to victory over St.i]ohn’s

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

NEW YORK — Tray Woodall
wouldn’t let the Panthers lose again.

The senior point guard didnt
like‘ how the Pitt men’s basketball
team played in last Wednesday’s
ugly 51-42 defeat to No. 25 Notre
Dame at the Petersen Events Center,
and he wasn’t afraid to express his
frustration in the post—game press
conference.

“Selﬁsh,” he called the Panthers’
poor offensive performance against
the Irish.

Athletes don’t throw that word
around lightly.

But when his teammates strug-
gled in the early minutes of the sec-
ond half of Sunday’s crucial Big East

contest at St. John’s, Woodall dis-

played some necessary selﬁshness
to ensure that his team didn’t suffer
its third—straight conference defeat.

After St. John’s’ took its ﬁrst
lead of the game, Pitt’s senior point
guard responded how a senior
should: He scored. his team’s next
six points and led the Panthers (21-
7, 9-6 Big East) to an important 63-
47 victory over the Red.Storm (16-
11, 8-7 Big East) at Madison Square

Garden in New York City.

“It felt like a must—win,” Woodall

i said after the game. “This_ was our '

last regular-season game [at Madi-
son Square Garden], and I wanted
to make sure that we came out with
awin.” ,

The Brooklyn, N.Y., product was
not denied in the Big Apple on this
day. '

“I was comfortable. I’m a senior.

I should be comfortable here,” said
a pleased Woodall, who ﬁnished
with a season—l1igh 25 points, four
rebounds, two‘ assists and zero
turnovers. _

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
smiled when asked about his senior
point guard before praising every
aspect of Woodall’s performance
Sunday. ' _ ,

“He was terriﬁc in every way.

Every shot he took was good, and

he handled the ball well. I think he
played good defense as well,” Coach
Dixon said of Woodall. “I can’t say
enough about how well he played.”

Dixon also stated that he wants
Woodall to “be a leader and hold
guys accountable.”

Woodall certainly held his team-
mates accountable after the Notre
Dame game when he called Pitt self-

ish and said passing up open shots
> can be another form of selﬁshness. _

And The Panthers listened.

Pitt grabbed the lead by launch-
ing almost every open shot it creat-
ed against a stingy St.John’s defense
in the ﬁrst half, heeding the advice
of Woodall and Dixon to gain a 30-
27 halftime advantage.

When that assertive nature be-
gan faltering and St. John’s grabbed
a 33-32 lead, Woodall didn’t flinch,
restoring his team’s conﬁdence
by draining a deep 3-pointer and
completing a gutsy, old—fashioned
3-point_ play.

Pitt never lost the lead again.
Woodall simply wouldn’t let them

And like all good senior leaders
do, he played hard untilthe very
end.

With Pitt up by 14 points late
and the result seemingly beyond all
doubt, Woodall ran into‘ the back-
court, dove on a loose ball and skid-
ded_on the Madison Square Garden
court, preventing St. John’s from
scoring an easy bucket and retain-
ing possession for the Panthers.

'I‘hat’s leadership.

‘_‘He had the hot hand,” Pitt red-

shirt junior small forward Lamar ._

nother heartbreaker, remains winless in Big East 

Patterson said of Woodall. “We kept ‘

rotating the ball, and the way he
was shooting, he was knocking [his
shots] down today. That’s what we
expect out of our leader.”

In the same city that installed
incredible toughness and leader-
ship in him, Tray Woodall might
have put the Panthers’ season back
on track. I I

to shrink the gap in increments. The margin
would get as little as one before the break.

Woodall, a native of nearby Brooklyn, N.Y.,
navigated the Garden ﬂoor with expertise and
continued to challenge when his teammates
seemed pensive. He and Patterson, who ﬁn-
ished with 11 points, carried the team on of-
fense. _

“I wanted to try and shift momentum of the
team,” Woodall said, referencing the moment
early in the second half when St.John’s took the
lead, and the Pitt senior point guard responded
by scoring six consecutive points to give the
Panthers an advantage they wouldn’t lose.

The difference between the ﬁrst and the
second periods came down to depth, with the
Red Storm utilizing eight players to Pitt’s 10,
setting up abattle of endurance that the former
would fail to win. '

“Pittsburgh grinded out a victory, which
so often in the Big East is the only way to get
a victory,” Lavin said.

Lavin credited Pitt’s deep bench with con-
syming his team, disallowing it the chance to
create‘ momentum as the game wore on.

“Their depth was a factor in terms of wear-
ing us down over the course of the game,” he
said. “That was probably [also] a factor in
terms of us missing shots and not shooting
as well from the 3-point line.”

. The Red Storm shot just 2—for-15 from be-
yond the arc, with both successful shots com-
ing in the ﬁrst half.

Pitt used eight players who each recorded

at least 10 minutes of playing time, and fresh-

man Durand Johnson saw the court for nine
minutes. The balanced distribution stood in
stark contrast to the Red Storm, which had
one player play the entire game and ﬁve others
play 20 minutes or more.

"‘That took a toll,” Lavin said. “They could
keep the pressure up, sustain their intensity
and keep fresh bodies on the ﬂoor.”

St. John’s shot a mere 26 percent from the
ﬁeld in the second half after connecting at a
37—percent rate in the ﬁrst. The team also com-
mitted seven of its 10 turnovers in the later half.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon acknowledged
his entire squad’s ever-present ability to con-

-tribute in ways other than scoring.

“It’s always the key,” Dixon said of his team’s
depth. “We didn’t get a lot [of offense] . We had
10 guys playing, and they didn’t have great
numbers. But: I thought they allowed us to
rotate some guys in.”

Coach Dixon also praised his entire team’s
defensive effort.

“They defended well. I thought they all
defended well,” he said. ,

The problems Pitt’s defense created for the
opposition was the crucial aspect of the result,
according to the Panthers’V‘head,coach.

“You gotta Win this game with defense,”
Dixonsaid. ,. if _, 1; ~ 3
