 

Senate approves legal policy revisions

By Sam Gresock ‘

News Assistant

Following in the footsteps of Pitt’s
recent investigation of Professor Herbert
Needleman’s research practices, Senate
Council yesterday approved revisions to
Pitt’s indemnification and legal-defense
policy for faculty and staff.

Indemnification is defined as legal pro-

tection from liability for damages.

According to Senate Council President

Professor _James Holland, the indemnifi-
cation issue became a hot topic during a

Pitt judicial
procedures
explained at
open forum

By Jonathan Hayes
For T be Pitt News

Students and faculty members with
questions about the Judicial Board
review system had an opportunity to dis-
cuss their concerns Monday afternoon in
Forbes Quad.

Ellen Modano and Sangeeta Kamat,
graduate students in the School of
Education, organized the forum to open
up the debate over judicial reform and
inform members of the university com-
munity about their role in judicial
processes.

The event featured moderator Chenits
Pettigrew as well as three panelists: Louis
Chandler, associate dean of Academic
and Student Affairs; Elizabeth Baranger,
associate provost; and Susan Rubisch-
Gisler, coordinator of the University
Student Judicial System. ’

Chandler said the forum was basically
designed “to share information on the
various procedures used for processing
grievances at the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Rubisch-Gisler said formal grievances
are filed in the Office of Judicial Affairs.
Most cases are settled without a judicial
board hearing, she said.

The Office of Residence Life handles
60 percent of all complaints, campus
police settle 30 percent and the rest are

recent investigation by Pitt’s Senate
Relations Committee in which
Needleman was investigated for possible
research integrity violations.

Needleman’s 1979 report on the effects
of low-level lead exposure on children’s
lQs was the target of concern by the
National Institutes of Health. The NIH
asked Pitt to conduct an investigation on
Need1eman’s credibility in research.

“  we had lawyers all over the place
and you couldn’t be indemnified
because it was considered an internal
investigation and our policy didn’t apply

to it,” Holland said.

The revised policy, which identifies
internal investigative proceedings as
“those conducted by the university under
university rules and guidelines," states
employees are not eligible for defense
and/or indemnification during an inter-
nal proceeding.

However, employees can be legally
protected if an internal proceeding
results from allegations made by an out-
side person or group that is represented
by legal counsel in the proceeding.

US. force
needed in
Yugoslavia,
says former
ambassador

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Former Yugoslav Ambassador
Warren Zimmerman said the
United States is on a “much better
course” after President Clinton’s
decision to use force last month.

“Judiciously, in a limited way, it
must be made known that the
United States wont tolerate further
aggression [in the former
Yugoslavial,” Zimmerman said.

Zimmerman spoke yesterday to
Pitt students and faculty in Forbes
Quad on “The Yugoslav Crisis: An
Update." Zimmerman, who was
U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia
from 1989 to 1992, resigned from
the State Department last January
due to a disagreement with US.
policy in the region.

He warned the audience not to
categori’/.e U.S. involvement in the
former Yugoslavia with previous
involvements such as Vietnam.

“People say they are worried
about a quagmire such as_Vietnam,
but that is not relevant,”
Zimmerman said. “Getting involved
does not necessarily mean the com-
mitment of 5()O,()O() troops. Certain
strategic humanitarian strikes might
improve the situation.”

The speech, sponsored by Pitt’s
Center for Russian and East
European Studies and the
Pittsburgh World Affairs Council,
also focused on the effects of post-
World War II history on the current
situation.

“The fire of nationalism which
has been so destructive to
Yugoslavia m_ust be quelled,”
Zimmerman said. He said there
remains a large potential for future
conflicts due to the ﬁerce national-
ism in the former Yugoslavia.

He characterized Yugoslavia
since World War II as a tragic three-
act play.

Historical connection, mg/tbs of Africa addressed by speaker

John B. Moore
Staff‘ Writer

“It’s a topic one can talk about for
hours, days and even months,” said Dr.
Buba Misawa, a professor of Africana
Studies at the University of Pittsburgh,
referring to the relationship between
Africans and African-Americans he dis"-
cussedat last night's Black Action
Society sponsored lecture.

In discussing the relationship between
the two, Misawa said there is a great deal

0

of myth about Africa generated in
Western society.

Misawa said he was approached by a
student once, wanting to know if it was
true that Africans don’t wear clothing.
Laughing this off, Misawa said he told
the student that he bought clothes after
getting off the airplane in New York
City.

There is also the misconception that
Africa is one country with just one lan-
guage and one history. Misawa said he
has been approached by people wanting

him to speak African after hearing that
he is from Africa.

Putting aside myths concerning Africa,
there is definitely a historical connection
between Africans and African-
Americans, said Misawa.

“Africans were brought to America,
through involuntarymigration, or slav-
ery,” Misawa said, and through colonial-
ization Africa has been faced with a
Western presence.

In discussing how Africans and
African-Americans View each other, it is

not important to talk about the difference
in hair, or the difference in clothing, said
Misawa.

“The most important issue is what is
the cultural basis of unity  and the
nature of oppression each group has
faced. [Africa] has gone through colonial-
ization and [African-Americans] have
gone through slavery.”

Misawa said that among Africans and
African—Americans, there is the aware-
ness of the historical context, the eco-

Meat not needed for balanced diet, says speaker

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Last night, while many Pitt
students enjoyed cheeseburgers
and chicken patties for dinner,
Matt Ball, a seven-year vegetari-
an, spoke to Pitt’s Students for
Ethical Treatments of Animals
about the value of a vegetarian
diet.

Ball, a graduate student at
Carnegie-Mellon University, dis-
tributed pamphlets promoting
animal rights and showed
videotapes concerning animal
cruelty at the presentation in the
Kurtzman Room of the William
Pitt Union.

SETA President Rene
McCafferty considered the pre-
sentation a “seminar in general
animal rights."

“Vegetarianism is the most
important idea in the struggle
for animal rights," Ball said.

“The amount of suffering these
animals go through is tremen-
dous. They spend their entire
lives on farms [that are] inten-
sive conﬁnement systems.”

need to be careful  [to] eat a

Vegetarianism is the most

Ball attempted to disprove
certain “myths” outlined in a
pamphlet from the Farm Animal
Reform Movement, a group he
belongs to.

According to FARM, human
health, or the ‘lack of it. is a
major concern among oppo-
nents of vegetarianism.

diseases from not eating meat,

according to FARM.

Ball spoke about the 1niscon—
ceptions that many meat-eaters
have about vegetarianism.

“Few people realize the darn-
age an animal—eating diet has on
society. We [humans] can sur-
vive much better if we don’t eat

the typical American choles-
terol-laden diet,” Ball said.

Concerning the belief that
vegetarianism can lead to dis-
eases, the FARM pamphlet said
that “there has never been a
confirmed case of anyone get-
ting sick or dying for lack of
meat in their diet.”

“Unbiased research has
shown that your body has no
need for dairy or meat food
products,” Ball added.

“Most [eating] diseases in\ the
United States are caused from
excessiveness, usually of fat and
cholesterol [and] people who do
not eat meat products have a
better chance of avoiding breast
cancer and heart disease,” Ball
said.

Along with an increased
chance of potentially—deadly
diseases, Ball said that contami-

Athletic Department head physician leaves for Penn

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
physician Freddie H. Fu is leaving Pitt to
take a position at the University of
Pennsylvania, according to the UPMC
News Bureau.

Fu, a professor of orthopedic surgery,
was instrumental in the establishment
of the sports medicine program at
Pitt.

He currently serves as the vice-chair
and chief of the division of sports medi-
cine at UPMC as well as the medical

director of the Center for Sports
Medicine.

Fu, who is the head physician for the
Pitt Athletic Department, will be leaving
Pitt in September to serve as Penn’s chair
of orthopedic surgery.

“He has made a valuable contribution
to the sports medicine program here,”
said James Hemdon, chair of orthopedic
surgery at UPMC.

According to Herndon, UPMC has
been able to set up a large research pro-
gram and take a leadership position in
treating sports injuries. ,

“He played a large part in those pro-

grams,” Hemdon said.

“[Fu] has built a strong staff at Pitt
and brought in a large number of
physical trainers. [Sports medicine] is
a very broad-based program,” Herndon
said.

Fu also is a professor of orthopedic
surgery at UPMC and associate professor
at Pitt’s School of Health and
Rehabilitation Sciences. He serves as
company physician for the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre.

According to the UPMC News Bureau,
Fu is chair and executive director of the
Giant Eagle/City of Pittsburgh Marathon

and 10K.

He reports to the Athletic Congress,
which supervises drug testing in these
eventsthroughout the country.

Fu was recently honored for his contri-
butions to the Pittsburgh community by
receiving Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s “Distinguished Public Service
Award.”

Herndon said although UPMC would
miss Fu, it is important to realize the pro-
grams which Fu set up will stay.

“We will continue to be a national and
international leader in sports medicine,’
Herndon said.

The Latin rhythm of guitars,
steel drums and flutes filled
Benedum Auditorium last
Thursday as part of the Latin
American Cultural Awareness
festival.

The festival, arranged by Pitt’s
Center for Latin American
Studies and the Institute for
International Studies in
Education, was organized for
Spanish classes from local high
schools.

This was the.festival’s first
year for elementary and middle
schools. _

“It’s nice because [culture] is
hard to bring into the school,”
said Jackie Lyall, one of the
Spanish teachers at the event.

“Pitt’s Latin Studies is more
concerned with education and
culture to share in school,” Lyall
said.

Mark Ginsberg from the IISE
said the festival was “intended
to help them [Spanish teachers]
in giving information” to a vast
amount of students.

He said the idea came from a _

number of discussion work-
shops he attended with ele-
mentary and high-school teach-
ers. ’

The guitar ensemble
Masuhallpa is from the Andes
Mountains. ,

They performed traditional
and popular folk music in
brightly-colored ponchos typi-
cal of the Andes’ people. For
the song “'Caracoles,” a town
song used to call others, stu-
dents were chosen to play some
instruments.

The announcer for the cere-
monies, Maria Ruiz of Pitt’s Latin
American Studies, spoke about
the importance of education.
She said all the members in
Masuhallpa were also profes-
sionals’.

“The message is to stay
in school and graduate,” she
said.

The steel-drum ensemble
Steel Impressions included
three students studying Pan
music. The ensemble was led
by Phil Solomon, who
explained how Pan music
began.

He said the steel band was
invented by the young people
of the Caribbean between the
ages of seven and 14. He began
to play when he was eight by

Solomon also explained how
the steel drum is made. The
drums are made from 55—gallon
steel barrels.

It is fashioned to contain the
full chromatic scale like the
piano. With the scale it can play
any type of-music like jazz,
calypso, reggae, pop and classi-
cal. '

Thursday was the second per-
formance this month. The first
was held for elementary stu-
dents and the second for high
school.

The festival was modeled
after the Latin Americanand
Caribbean Folk Festival, which
will have its 15th event April 9
at Trees Hall.

cause death.

“Bacterial contamination
of animal products has
caused children to die of
food poisoning in recent
years,” Ball said.

According to Ball, two
other concerns of people
considering vegetarianism
are that there will be a
shortage of grown foods
and there will be a lack of
good taste in a vegetarian
diet. _

“The food that could be
saved if people ate the
corn and oats used to feed
livestock could feed the
world over 15 times,” Ball
said.

He said he disagrees
with the taste
because “most people
don’t salivate when they
see how an animal is
slaughtered.

“People often say,” Ball
said, “as long as animals
are raised and killed
humanely, I have no prob-
lem eating them. But these
livestock have no protec-
tion against cruel treatment
like cats and dogs do.”

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 22, 1994

Yugoslav

Continued from page 1

According to Zimmerman, the first
act would be about the late Yugoslav
leader Marshal Tito and his legacy in
the country. He said the second act,
which would begin in 1989 and last to
the early ‘90s, would be about the
surge of nationalism. The third act
would be about the recent ﬁghting in
the former Yugoslavia.

Zimmerman acknowledged that
Tito was a wartime ally of the United
States and said he helped prove that
an Eastern European country could
function on an independent path
from the Soviet Union.

However, he said when Tito died in
1980 he left two “poison gifts” which
directly affect Yugoslavia to this day.

“The first was the development of
hegemonic power in the country,”
Zimmerman said. “He decentralized
the Yugoslavian government to the
point where the country was almost
ungoverned. The central government
was too weak to ever be refomted.”

The second “gift,” according to
Zimmerman, was the timely emer-
gence of nationalism.

“Tito did not like nationalists and
went to great lengths to stop them,”
he said. “His suppression, therefore,
made it inevitable that it would later
explode, and that’s exactly what hap-
pened.”

At that time, according to
Zimmerman, there was also no
democracy in Yugoslavia which
would have “filtered out” dema-
gogues.“Nationalists were able to go

straight to the top,” he said. “They
took over the organs of control such
as the police and the media.”

Zimmerman said this led to the sec-
ond act of his “play.” According to
Zimmerman, more happened
between 1989 and 1992 than in the
previous 40 years.

“Nationalists won almost all elec-
tions,” he said. “Also, this is when the
war between the Serbs and Croatians
started.”

Zimmerman said people should be
wary of nationalism because of the
similarities between nationalism and
communism.“B.oth practice exclu-
sivism intolerance,” he said, “and
both think you should solve problems
by force. They also believe in the
degeneration of the individual for the
good of the whole.”

. He encouraged the U.S. govern-
ment to take a greater interest in
Bosnia because of the inhumane con-
ditions which exist. “We see the eth-
nic cleansing and atrocities [of which
officials are awarel,” Zimmerman said.

He also said it was not clear
whether agreements between Eastern
European republics will hold, but
despite these problems, he had a pos-
itive statement about the future of
Eastern Europe.

“I believe there is at least a hopeful
sign in all of this ...” Zimmerman said.
“There seems to be a common feeling
that it’s possible in the long run,
meaning 20 or 30 years, that there
could be some kind of inter-ethnic
peace.”

Senate

Continued from page 1

Holland said that though the
revised policy is still somewhat
vague, it covers more than the
previous guidelines.

“It’s a halfway improvement,”
Holland said. “It [still] doesn’t
handle the problem of an inter-
nal investigation as thoroughly
as we might have liked, but it
represents 21 studied compro-
mise of the issue. It’s a clear
improvement.”

Holland said except for clari-
fying internal investigations and
a few changes in wording, the
revised policy does not differ
much from the original one
approved by Senate Council.

“lThe original policy] was
approved in principle, but [Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor]
felt there was a need for a com-
mittee of lawyers to look at it,”
Holland said.

“Really, the only changes
were ones of clarifying word-
ing,” Holland said.

According to Holland, Pitt
should support Needleman,
who was recently cleared of sci-
entific-misconduct charges.

“The time has come for the
university to be very active in
rehabilitating [Needleman’sl
reputation,” Holland said. “I
think we need to do more and
we’ll be expecting that.”

Needleman received
O’Connor’s 1994 Chancellor’s
Service Award last month.

In other Senate Council busi-

- ness, O’Connor announced the

names of the final candidates
for provost. Pitt physics profes-
sor James Maher and current
interim-Provost Mark A.
Nordenberg were among the
seven finalists, who will be
undergoing on—campus inter-
views with members of the
Pitt community through mid-
April.

ovation proposal which Pitt
Director of Athletics Oval Jaynes
discussed at last week’s Faculty
Assembly meeting.

O’Connor said the project will
be funded solely through pri-
vate donations and money gen-
erated from ticket-price increas-
es.

Additionally, the proposal still
must be reviewed before reno-
vations begin.

“Of course, the project is sub-
ject to the university’s internal
review process where it will be
viewed in the context of other
related projects,” O’Connor
said. “That process is still ongo-
ing.”

In other business, Bob
Robertson and Fredric Goss, co-
directors of Senate Council’s Ad
Hoc Steering Committee for the
Faculty/Staff Wellness Program,
spoke of proposed improve-
ments in the program.

The program, according to
Robertson, provides Pitt faculty,
staff and research with health
screenings, exercise and nutri-
tion sessions and health-promo-
tion programs.

“One thing we -think is really
important is we’re trying to

impact the quality of life from
the standpoint of promoting

physical activity and healthy"

lifestyles among faculty and
staff,” Robertson said.

Robertson said members of
the wellness committee are cur-
rently investigating a central site
for wellness programs.

According to Robertson,
many wellness programs are
held in Trees Hall, which makes
taking part in such sessions
inconvenient for many faculty
and staff.

“We know it’s not always easy
for folks to get up and down the
hill even when the buses are
available,” Robertson said.

"One of the reasons we

thought we’d like to extend our
programming down on the
lower campus is that it’s much
more convenient.”

Robertson said he has asked
for Pitt’s support for a central-
ized wellness building should
the university construct a new
building near the intersection of
Forbes Avenue and South
Bouquet Street, which is cur-
rently under consideration.

“We’re not asking for a whole
lot of space but we’re asking for

a little bit of space where we
could have an exercise and

educational center,” Robertson
said. O

“The kinds of facilities we're
talking about could also cer-
tainly be extended to student
use.”

Robertson said a centralized
building could lead to growth of
new wellness programs.

“If you plan things when you
build them from the start, it
doesn’t really impact a lot on
space,” Robertson said.

“lThe central Oakland build-
ing] would be very large, and
we could accommodate the

needs of the university’s faculty,

said.

In other business, Holland
discussed a proposed staff
early-retirement plan which is
currently being developed and
which Senate Council will
review at May’s meeting.

According to the plan, regular
full-time staff members who are
at least 59 years of age and will
have completed 10 years of ser-
vice at Pitt by June 30, 1994 will
be eligible for retirement.

Holland said non—tenured fac-
ulty should also be covered by
early retirement since they per-
form similar work as tenured
professors.

Holland said, “[Non-tenured
faculty] teach, they do research

. the only difference is that
they’re non—tenured.”

“I’m going to persist in this
until we get it resolved,” he
added.

Through centuries of slavery and

have accommodated to Western ways
of life.

Having gone through racism in
America, Misawa said that many
African—Americans see Africa as the

“Africa has become an ideal model
where nothing can go wrong  but
many Africans have oppressed their

“[They] view Africa as something
they can use because it’s fashionable to
be African,” Misawa said.

Africa, a gap is created between them

that attempting to understand the
relationship between Africans and
African-Americans is not a new con-

Protection for services rendered .

At yesterday’s University Senate Council meeting, the
University of Pittsburgh provided a policy to protect its
employees in the event of a legal action against them.
The policy, as stated by the university, reads as fol-
lows: “Except as prohibited by law, the University of
Pittsburgh shall furnish each current and former
employee of the University with legal defense and pay-
ment of judgments, fines, penalties, settlements and
any other expenses actually and reasonably incurred in
connection with a_n actual or threatened [legal] action

This policy protects employees if their actions hap-
pen while they are carrying out university—related work
and are not deliberately criminal in nature. The policy
may also extend to the employee’s writings and public
service that relates to the employee’s position in the
university. This does not give university employees
carte blanche to commit crimes withthe promise of
free defense.

It is a common sense approach which will encourage
employee loyalty. Also, this will aid in recruiting more
employees, since they would know that the university
will stand by the actions it asks its employees to carry
out. While in some fields this may seem a bit inane, in
research, where the questions sometimes run into a
gray area, this is a valuable protection. -

Don't forget the students

Health care reform is not only an issue facing the
national government, it is also being dealt with right

here on Pitt’s campus. The Student Health Service‘

office is being remodeled and will include all health
services in one building. As the university moves to
redesigning the health care office, it should not forget
tonmake all‘o‘wan_ce_s for Student Health’s education
office. Good health is an important part of a student’s
life. Although a number of services are provided by the
Health Education Office, these are primarily therapeu-
tic in nature. While this is an element of health care,
prevention also plays a large role, because most of the
problems the student health treats are minor, and prop-
er education can help to prevent more serious illness.

The University Senate discussed a plan to institute an
employee health program with the overall goal of
being a preventative measures program. Their overall
goal is to reduce the amount of money the University
loses because of absenteeism and tardiness, and to
improve overall ‘employee health. These goals are
pragmatic; However, the University Sl1OE1ilCl promote
similar goals in students. Although they already have
the students’ money, student absenteeism and-tardiness
creates a loss for the university as a whole in more
than just pecuniary matters. So, while we support the
university’s efforts to improve employee health, the
students must not be forgotten.

China must be most favored nation

With Secretary of State Warren Christopher’s
trip to China now complete, and regarded as a
near total failure, it appears that the Clinton
administration is one step closer to revoking
China’s, Most Favored Nation status.

The most often cited reason for such a possi-
bility is the human rights violations perpetrated
by the Beijing government. While it is clear that
such violations do occur in China, as they do in
nearly every nation on earth in one form or
another, the U.S. government is focusing on the
wrong issues.

At present, the U.S. government is concentrat-
ing on Tibet, religious persecution and political
dissidents.

doing business in China’s booming southern
coast. _

This is evidence that, for all but a few dissi-
dents who have nothing better to do, people in
China are concerned with their standard of liv-
ing much more than some obscure Western
notion of democracy.

The best way for the United States to encour-
age political change in China is to foster eco-
nomic growth through trade, cultural exchange
and foreign investment.

The Chinese government will not be bullied
into accepting the U.S. position that trade be
connected with human rights issues. China and

A the United States clearly have

ple, largely because only one

different views of human rights
and will continue to do so for a
long time to come. If political
change is to come to China, it
will come from internal pres-

the public.

Today Tibet receives vast amounts of financial

support from the central government in Beijing,
and the people have the opportunity to get at
least a minimal education.
. This was impossible under the rule of the
Dalai Lama, who kept the people ignorant and
virtually enslaved. Tibet is one of only five
autonomous regions in China, and it is time for
the U.S. government to face reality and drop the
rhetoric.

The so-called “religious persecution” that the

West, particularly the United States, claims is
occurring in China is not religious persecution
at all. —
The fact is that Chinese people DO have the
freedom to worship in whatever religion they
choose, whether it be Christianity, Buddhism,
Islam, etc.

The only people who are persecuted are
those who use religion as a cover for subversion
of the government. I have traveled throughout
China and have seen firsthand the religious free-
dom that the various religious sects have. When
the Chinese government does crack down, it is
for inciting riots and/or causing political disor-
der, not for peacefully practicing religion.

While there is no doubt that the Chinese gov-
ernment has recently been intensifying its sur-
veillance and questioning of leading dissidents,
a less reported fact in the Western press is that
there are also several leading political dissidents
who are thriving and making a good living

sures, not from external pressure
from the West.

Besides the fact that the withdrawal of MFN
status will do absolutely nothing to foster
democracy, it will do a tremendous amount of
damage to U.S. business interests in China.

The United States is currently China’s largest
export market, and two-way trade between the
two nations has increased from $2.5 billion in
1979 to more than $40 billion in 1993 (779e Wall
Street journal 3/ 4/94). E

This year exports to China will reach $512 bil-
lion (World Trade 3/94).

Over the next two decades, China will be the
largest market in the world for the exporting of
U.S. products. This alone guarantees that if MFN
status is revoked, the United States will suffer
just as much as China. In the long term, the
United States will be affected even more.

It seems to me to be completely ludicrous for
the United States to base its foreign policy on a
nation’s internal policies. If other nations were
to do the same thing, I would venture that the
United States would not fare much better.

The U.S. government needs to straighten out
the internal problems in this country before
meddling in those of other nations. And Clinton
needs to figure out that the United States can’t
continue to alienate itself from Asia. Stop whin-
ing and trade —- it’s a great market over there
and it’s only going to get better".

Baseball team enjoys Floridays, rolls to 7-4

With unexpected offense and solid pitching, the Panthers sweep through Sunshine State

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Propelled by a 5-0 start, the Pitt baseball
team blasted off into the 1994 season with a
successful 6-2 record on their spring—break
trip to Fort Myers and DeLand, Fla. A dou-
bleheader sweep by Kent State this past
Sunday, however, gave the Panthers a 7-4
overall record as they now prepare for the
bulk of their schedule in the coming weeks.

After graduating several of his top offen-
sive players last year, Panther head coach
Mark Jackson had to be wondering if his
team this season could put up the same
numbers it had in ‘93, when it finished tops
in the Big East with a .333 team batting
average. ‘

He didn’t have to wait long for the
answer.

The Panthers put to rest any doubts as to
their offensive capabilities by exploding for
52 runs during their perfect 5-0 start, includ-
ing 19 in a barnburner against conference
rival Boston College.

The Panthers have gotten excellent offen-
sive production from all around their line-
up, and after 11 games this year, nine
Panthers are hitting better than .300, and
three have slugging percentages of over
.400. Sophomore Bob Miller and junior
Tyler Shantz have been two of the Panthers’
most potent offensive threats so far. Miller
leads the team with a .400 average and 14
runs scored, and Shantz tops all Panthers
with 15 runs batted in. Between them,
Miller and Shantz have figured in on-halfof
the Panthers’ 92 runs.

_ The one noticeable difference, between
last year’s Panthers and the ‘94 squad is in
the long-ball department. In the Panthers’
first 11 games this year, they have managed

A to put only one ball over the fence, a sharp

decline from last season, when they were
second in the Big East with 43 roundtrip-
pers in as many games.

lead the Lady Panthers in the
first round of the Women’s
National Invitational basketball
Tournament against the
University of Gonzaga.
Until three years ago, Morton,
one of the best point

only dreamed about
playing on the colle-
giate level.
As Little C grew up
on the small island of

S St. Kitts in the West

wondered what it would be like
to play organized basketball.

With the help of Larry
Vignella, a Uniontown, Pa.,
native who worked for the
Peace Corps in St. Kitts, her
dream became a reality.

As Vignella practiced with
Morton, they developed a close
bond, leading to a mentor/stu-
dent relationship.

Men's tennis beats Loyola, splits weekend matches

By Ed Ziegenfuss

This past weekend the Pitt
men’s tennis team took the
court against two very formida-
ble opponents. On Saturday, St.
Bonaventure University came to
town. In a grueling match, the
Bonnies defeated the Panthers,
4-3.

SBU was a very tough team
sporting a record of 10-0, but

out of the other four matches all
went to three sets.

Brad Wade lost a tough match
6-3, 4-6, 6-3 as did Dumpel (6-4,
4-6, 6-3), and Chronister (6-3, 6-
2).

The closest match of the day
was that of Jeff Campbell. He
took the first set 7-6 but lost the
remaining two sets 7-6, 7-5. This
win gave the Bonnies the 4-3
victory.

On Sunday, the Panthers
returned to the Cost Center to
take on Loyola College of
Maryland. Loyola came in worn

them.

As a matter of fact, Pitt did not

Gymnast  

Lannie bit

baa/e bug to

post strong

'94 season

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff‘ Writer

This season, the rnen’s
gymnastics team has had
little to cheer about.
Injuries have reared their
ugly heads again, and no
one has been immune.
One athlete who suffered
a serious injury was
sophomore Jason Lannie.
Jason severely ‘sprained
his left ankle on Jan. 15 at
Navy. He has undergone
extensive rehabilitation
and returned to action the
final weekend of
February, finishing with
scores of 8.40 on pommel
horse, 8.60 on rings and
7.90 on parallel bars in his
first match back since his
rehab.

Lannie was born and
raised in Liverpool, N.Y.,
just outside of Syracuse.

He got his start in gym- 

nastics at the age of seven
when he made the team
on his first day at the
gym. He continued to
compete at the club level,
and when he was twelve,
Lannie finished second at
Junior Regionals and
received a trip to the
United States Olympic
Training Center in
Colorado Springs,
Colorado.

Lannie continued his
strong performances
throughout high school.
In his junior and senior
years at Liverpool High
School, he won the New
York State
Championships in the all-
around and high bar. He
also went on to the High
School National
Championships, where he
became an All-American
in all-around and vault.

were the only schools to
respond.

After a long discussion with
Vignella, Morton chose Pitt.

“Howard was interested. They
said that they [saw] a lot of
potential,” Morton said.

“But Howard had already
committed in terms of scholar-
ships. Coach Bruce was in the
same position. He said, ‘Hey,
look, we don’t have anything
available. There is no way we
could give her a scholarship for
her first year. But if there is
some way you can pay for her
first year, then we might give
her a scholarship for her second
year.’

“That’s what happened. My
dad paid for my first semester.
After my first semester, [Bruce]
gaveme a scholarship.”

The coaching staff at Pitt felt
that Little C possessed too much
raw skill for them to pass up.

“I saw the tape, and she had a
lot of ability,” Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce said.

“The biggest risk was not see-
ing her play live. You couldn’t
judge the quickness and ability
from a tape. But I felt as though
she had the things that you
couldn’t teach. Since she had all
those things, we felt as if we
could help her develop the
rest.”

In 1991, Morton jumped on
her dream of playing organized
basketball.

“I wasn’t getting any
younger,” Morton said. “At 22
years of age, I didn’t want to
depend on my parents. I didn’t
feel right. I didn’t want to feel

like a burden on my parents. So,

I came to play at Pitt because it
was my chance to play ball and
be independent.”

As a 23-year-old rookie, she
became overjoyed with learning
the knowledge of the game.

“When I came here the first
year, it was kind of amazing,”

bad.”

After looking at herself in the
mirror, the woman from St. Kitts
realized just being on the team
wasn’t enough.

While most of her teammates
went home for the summer,
Little C stayed in Pittsburgh to
work on her game. While prac-
ticing twice a day at Trees Hall,
Morton learned a lot more than
plays. She learned the inner
strength that one needs to

‘become a basketball player.

/ﬁt of the things that [Carol Morton]
has done for us this year have

been positive. There is nothing neg-

ative about the way she is playing.”

-Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce ”-

Morton said. “I saw how a struc-
tured practice was. I was lost.
You think you know how a
structured practice is until you
get here.” .

Morton said that after she
stopped being amazed by the
things around her, she began to
get depressed because of her
lack of output.

“There were times back in
my first and second year when I
couldn’t take it because I wasn’t
playing as much,” she said. “As
an individual I wasn’t doing as
much, and that makes you feel

After the summer, a lot of her
teammates noticed what she
accomplished.

“She has learned to control
her speed,” teammate Jenine
Joyce said.

“She has had a lot of control
in her game, and she has cut
down a lot of her turnovers. Her
shooting used to be the least
perfected part of her game, but
this year she is making her
shots.”

Morton’s efforts thus far this
season have propelled the Lady
Panthers to a 19-9 record.

  Cap, Gown & Hood Orders

Despite only averaging five
points per contest, Morton’s
presence on the court gives Pitt
an edge over the
competition.

“Carol is the main reason that
we are doing what we are
doing,” Bruce said.

“She gives you what you
need. She plays hard every sec-
ond she is out there. She can
run the fast break for us. ‘She
can penetrate, pass when she
has an open‘ player and she
plays very well when she is on
defense.

"All of the things that she has
done for us this year have been
positive. There is nothing nega-
tive about the way she is play-
ing.”

Assistant coach Larry
Anderson added this about
Morton’s performance this sea-
son: “Last year she was pretty
much of a spark plug for the
team, but she played a little bit
out of control at times. This year

she is playing a little bit more j

under control.

"I think she understands and
knows what her role is, and she
is still the spark plugof the
team. I just think she is doing a
good job overall.”

freshman, he ﬁnished sec-

all-around at ECACs and
was a member of the All-
ECAC Team. In the future,
Lannie hopes to reach
NCAA Regionals and
Nationals not only indi-

team as well.

This season has been
tough both physically and
mentally on Lannie.

“This year has been
awkward,” he said. “It
was my first serious
injury, and it is tough
mentally not being able to
participate.”

Lannie has not stood by
idle, however. He has
improved his upper body
strength while resting his
ankle. This can only help
him in the long run. As a
matter of fact, on his first
day back at practice,
Lannie went back up on

ankle doing. This indeed

THE PITT NEWS,Tuesday, March 22, 1994

Glenn, Donyell, et all must ﬁnish off deal signed in HS

Players who sign letter of intent in high school should be obligated to finalize deal with chosen school

At about this time every year,
talk begins over which college
basketball underclassmen are
considered to be primed for the
pro ranks. March Madness
brings with it certain lottery
lust.

College hoops analysts like
CBS’ Clark Kellogg and ESPN’s
Digger Phelps fill our ears with
hardship chatter. They inform
us not only of those underclass-
men considering the big jump
but also where they are expect-
ed to go in the draft.

Of course, there is also ana-
lyst Dick Vitale who preaches
that players should stay in
school and fulfill their commit-
ments. Vitale then, in the same
broadcast nonetheless,
expounds that, “I really believe
‘Hops Dunkalot’ is ready for the
next level. He’s gonna be awe-

some. He’s gonna be a multi-
millionaire babee. I mean how
can he pass up all that
money?”

Every year a very select group
of special players opt, with con-
siderable prodding from the
media and NBA scouts, for the
big bucks of the NBA.

This year’s crop of under-
classmen expected to declare
hardship is lengthy and
includes: Glenn Robinson
(Purdue), Jalen Rose (University
of Michigan), James Forrest
(Georgia Tech), Jason Kidd and
Lamond Murray (California) and
Donyell Marshall (University of
Connecticut).

Vitale is right in one sense. He
is right not because he supports
both sides of the issue, but
because he even acknowledges
it as an issue.

College basketball expects
yearly the mass exodus of its
top players. Not so much as a
peep of complaint is heard by
the colleges. Apparently the
money involved makes it all
right.

Jack
Becker

Maybe having never been
exposed to anything resembling
$1 million has allowed naivety
to set in, but shouldn’t athletes
be bound to fulﬁll the commit-
ments in their letters of
intent?

The assumption is clearly pre-
posterous, right? After all, who

is the NCAA or anyone else for
that matter to have the ability to
restrict the earning potential of
its athletes? We’ve also heard
the argument that college ath-
letes have been exploited
enough by the system without
the NCAA having the power to
force players to stay an entire
four years.

Those are valid points, but
what about the notion of a letter
of intent as a -binding contract?
Essentially, that is what a letter
of intent is. ,

When an athlete signs their
name to that letter, what they
are doing is signing a contract,
the deal being four years of free
education plus room and board
for the athlete in exchange for
four years of athletic service for
the university. It is a deal

If you have

involved.

The university almost always
lives up to its end of the bar-
gain.

The athlete usually has to fall
deep in hot water for the uni-
versity to yank a scholarship
away from a kid. The university
even holds a scholarship for an
athlete who has suffered a
career—ending injury or has
stumbled in academics.

Yet apparently, the athlete
isn’t accountable for holding up
the other end. Players are free
to jump ship and turn pro at the
expense of the colleges. Not
only are athletes eligible to
leave nearly at their will, but
some, like Glenn Robinson, are
«expected to bolt.

Think about the uproar that
would be created if the same
actions were taken on the
opposite end.

Would there be a problem if a
university suddenly decided
that an athlete was not good
enough and pulled the scholar-
ship? The story would make the
front page.

Maybe it’s time we stop these
athletes from using college ath-
letics as a shortened pit stop to
the pros. This is exactly what is

being encouraged, because the"

best players in the college game
are sophomores and juniors.
Think about it.

An entire argument could be
created for the fact that this is
the origin of why certain pro
athletes are confused by this
contract business.

How do we solve this prob-
lem? Simple. The kids should
have to play ball for four years
like the contract says.

But since that concept, realis-
tically belongs in the same cate-
gory as the tooth fairy, another
plan (a hitch in the contract if
you will) needs to be installed.
Since holding players to fulfill a
four—year commitment is
not in the foreseeable future,

athletes turning pro early‘

should have to reimburse the
universities.

The athlete that declares hard-‘

ship should be made to repay
the cost of tuition for the num-
ber of years remaining on their
eligibility. _

Along with an education, the
athlete also gets a free opportu-
nity to practice their trade and,
if the talent is there, improve
their stock with potential
employers (NBA, CBA,
etc.). '

Considering these stipula-
tions, a few measly dollars in
the thousands is not such a high
price to pay for a person about
to earn millions, even before
endorsements.

These athletes sail through
college on a cruise ship only to
declare hardship and turn pro.
It would seem that a detriment
should be in place to remind
college athletes of their
commitments and a little
cliche called good sportsman-
ship.

Continued from page 9

on a pace to notch their third
straight title, with an eleven-
game total of 66 thefts -— an
average of six stolen bases a
game.

While Pitt’s offensive corps
were making minced meat of
opposing pitchers, the Panther
hurlers largely kept their oppo-

nents’ run production in check,

aside from allowing 11 runs to
Boston College and seven to
Virginia Tech. Junior
righthander Jamie Goettler has
been Coach Jackson’s work-
horse so far, pitching 21 and 1/3
innings in three games, while
posting a 1-1 record and a 2.53
ERA. His most impressive out-
ing so far, however, was a no-
decision on March 12 against
Evansville. For 10 and 1/3
innings, Goettler baffled the
Purple Aces, giving up just six
hits and no runs in a game the
Panthers eventually won 1-0 on
a wild pitch in the 12th inning.

In relief, sophomore
righthander Matt Skokowski is
following up his successful
rookie season with a 0.00 ERA,
a 1-0 record and four strikeouts
in four appearances this year.

After a 9-5 loss to Stetson
closed out the Panthers’ other-
wise successful trip, they trav-
elled to Winfield, W.Va. to take
on the Thundering Herd of
Marshall University.

Sixteen hits, a ﬁve-run fourth
inning and a three-hit, two-RBI
day at the plate for DH Ken
Strish took all the thunder out of
the Herd, and winning pitcher
T edde Campbell (1-1) and the
Panthers cruised to a 14-4 victo-
ry, their seventh of the season.

Marshall roughed up Pitt
starter Greg Mrocko with six
hits and four runs in just one
and two-thirds innings. Relief
pitchers Tedde Campbell and
Ed Curtis kept the ‘Herd off the
board the rest of the way, and

the Panthers pieced together g

runs in six different innings to
pave the way for an impressive
victory.

The next step for the Panthers
would prove to be the one hur-
dle they could not cross, as they
were swept by the Golden
Flashes of Kent in a double-
header on Sunday.

In the opening game of the
twinbill, the Panthers took a 1-0
lead in the first inning, but
back-to-back three-run innings
by the Flashes in the third and
fourth frames nullified a late
Panther comeback, and Kent
won the game", 7-6.

Panther second baseman
Scott Etsell was unquestionably
the game’s top player, as he
accounted for nearly all of Pitt’s
runs by driving in three and
scoring three himself while
going 2-for-2 at the plate, with
two walks.

With the Panthers down 7-5
in the sixth inning, Etsell
brought themright back into
the game with a three-run
homer over the wall in left—cen—
ter field, cutting the Kent lead to
7-6. However, the Flash held
Pitt hitless for the remainder of
the game, giving Kent its first
victory of the season and the
Panthers their third defeat. They

would not have to wait long for
their fourth.

A seven-run sixth inning by
the Flash gave the nightcap a
much-less dramatic ending, as
the ten-run rule ended the game
after the Flash’s seventh run,
giving them a 12-2 victory.

Panther first baseman josh
Tyler provided much of Pitt’s
offense, going 2-for-2 and dri-
ving in a run, but two errors and
seven unearned runs spelled
doom for the Panthers and los-
ing pitcher Goettler (1-1).

Duquesne Dukes in a twilight
doubleheader starting at 1 p.m.
Their next home will be this
Thursday, when they host the

allel bars. He is hoping to
score in the 8.8 range
because he will lose .5-.7
points for not dismount-
ing on his tender ankle.
When asked about the
rest of this season, Lannie
said, “I want to remain
healthy and get back to
where I was. Right now
my ankle is about 70 per-
cent of what it was.” He is
eager to get back to 100
percent.

The future seems bright
for Lannie. At Pitt, he
would like to get to
regionals and nationals
with the team. However,
the team will be losing its
leader Genaro Severino
after this season.

“Genaro will leave big
shoes to fill. He will be
missed outside of the gym
as well as in it,” Lannie
said. The leadership role
is up for grabs next year
and Lannie is interested in
taking over that position.

Whatever happens,
Jason Lannie is back and
he’s ready to roll.
