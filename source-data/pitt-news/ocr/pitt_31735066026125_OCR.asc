Piﬂ Police appoint new chief

   

Brett Taylor

News Asslstant

After seven months with an interim
supervisor, the Pitt Police named
Deborah Furka new police chief.

Furka will come from Kean College
in Union, N .J ., an urban campus approx-
imately 10 miles from New York City.

Furka will take over Pitt's 90-mem-
ber police department which is 40 mem-
bers larger than her previous force at
Kean College.

When she begins her tenure on Feb.
1, she said her immediate plans will be to
evaluate the police department, and to

mty.

"It‘s a big department and a lot of
things in police departments are all the
same," she said. "But, each one [police
department] has it's own idiosyncrasies
that I have to learn.

"I will do a lot of looking and listen-
ing when I ﬁrst get there," she added.

Vice Chancellor Jerome Cochran,
who was in charge of ﬁnding a new
police chief, was unavailable for com-
ment.

Pitt has been without a police chief
since May when Rick Boyd resigned to
"get back in the ﬁeld investigating mur-
ders."

urka begins Feb. 2 as Pin pol cief

Embezzelment charges prompt
changes in student group funding

Anthony Breznican

Edltor In Chief

Pitt administrators
said Tuesday they will
place new funding
restrictions on student
groups after an investiga-
tion proved six students
embezzled nearly $4,000
from the allocations fund.

Director of Student
Affairs Bob Gallagher
said an internal audit
showed the students used
bogus organizations and
fraudulent receipts to
funnel activities money
into their own pockets
during the past year.

Gallagher could not
identify the students
involved due to privacy
laws, but said they must

return the money they‘

took and could be
expelled by Pitt’s Judicial
Board. Gallagher also
would not describe the
details of how the alleged
fraud began or was car-
ried out.

Gallagher said that
since one of the students
has graduated, the
University may withhold
his transcripts if he is

found guilty by the
Judicial Board.

The other students are
currently restricted from
registering for classes.

“I feel sorry for those
involved in this, but I
also feel bad for the stu-
dent body in general,”
Gallagher said. “Since
the money really is stu-
dent money, we tried to
set up a system that stu-
dents had a part in. But
now it appears our over-
sight should have been
better.”

The focus of the audit
and a criminal investiga-
tion by the Pitt Police was
former Allocations Chair
Gerald Klayman, who
oversaw distribution of

the money.

SGB members Ryan
Weidenmiller and
Marquette Bowman

accused Klayman in
October of misappropri-
ating money by signing

‘off on fraudulent requests

made by friends.

Some organizations in
question were the Boxing
Club, the Panther
Automobile Lover’s
Club, the Captain’s Crew

Club and the University
Darting Club.

Detective Kathy
Schreiber, who headed
the criminal investiga-
tion, could not be reached
for comment, but Deputy
Chief Gary Moses said no
criminal charges were
filed on the six.

Klayman said he was
"not in a position to com-
ment about the charges."

"I don't really know
what the charges are," he
said when asked if he
planned to fight them.

Among other new
changes in the allocations
process is a new checks
and balances system for

V the summer.

In past summers, the
allocations chair acted on
behalf of the entire com-
mittee and needed only
the approval of the SGB
president for requests of
over $500. Klayman was
solely responsible for
approving funding for
less than that amount.

The Office of Student
Activities will now
require “at least three
board members of the

Gary Moses, Pitt's deputy police

 

chief, ran the everyday operations of the
department, and reported directly to
John Devitto, the assistant vice chancel-
lor of Business, who was in charge of the
police department during the interim.

Furka leaves Kean College where
she has been serving in a similar position
to the Pitt job since 1995.

Before that, she spent 16 years at
Kent State University in Kent, Ohio as a
police officer and security guard.

In 1991, she was appointed assistant
director of police, where she also man-
aged the Kent State Law Enforcement
Institute.

She was the co—developer of a police

Sonny Bono dies in skiing

accident while in Nevada

Across the Nation

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. —
It’s known as “tree skiing,” and it
turned out to be the death of con-
gressman and former entertainer
Sonny Bono. Tree skiing is popular
with experts who ski- off the main
trail to get to fresh powder. Bono
had just skied into the woods of an
intermediate slope in Nevada when
he hit a tree. He died instantly of
head injuries, an autopsy revealed.

NEW YORK —— For the second
year in a row, Babyface is the one
to beat at the Grammys. Babyface
leads with eight nominations,
including album of the year — “The
Day.” He’ll compete in that catego-
ry with two old—timers, Bob Dylan
and Paul McCartney — along with
relative newcomers Paula Cole and
Radiohead.

Last year, Babyface was nomi-
nated 12 times, and won three
Grammys. Paula Cole is tied with
rapper Puff Daddy with seven nom-
inations. They’re both up for record
and song of the year. R. Kelley and
Erykah Badu have five nominations
apiece. Winners will be announced
Feb. 25 in New York.

Around the World

SEOUL, South Korea — Heeding a
call from the government, South
Koreans turned out by the tens of

thousands today to sell or donate-

gold to raise badly needed dollars.

The month-long drive is intended
to help the country repay $57 billion
owed to the international monetary
fund for its emergency rescue pack-
age.
Many of.South Korea’s largest
companies have also joined in the
campaign, collecting hundreds of
pounds of gold.

Drive organizers estimate
Koreans privately hold about 2000
tons of gold worth about $20 billion.

NEW DELHI, India —— More than
50 people are dead and over 60
injured after a train collision in India.

The United News of India says a
speeding passenger train ran a red
light and slammed into a parked train
near Karna, 400 miles southeast of
New Delhi.

The report said the first train had
stopped after hitting a cow.

The news agency quotes the rail-
road ministry as saying the death toll
could rise because some bodies could
be trapped in the debris.

Pitt will have to wait a little
longer to find out who the next dean
of its Faculty of Arts and Sciences
will be, but just how long isn't cer-
tain.

The search committee for a new
dean gave Provost James Maher a
list of three finalists at a meeting on
Dec. 23. That list included:

- Charles Cnudde, currently the
dean of social sciences and profes-
sor of political science at Florida
State University;

- John Cooper, professor of chem-
istry and former chair of that depart-

nd tn ee e tre;

  

ment at Pitt, and the only inside can-
didate who made it to the semifinal-
ist stage; and

0 Janet Madden, now vice—provost
for graduate education and professor
of economics at the University of
Pennsylvania.

Provost Maher will choose the
next dean of FAS from this small
pool, but is under no pressure to
make a quick decision. Maher origi-
nally gave the search committee a
deadline of Feb. 1, and the commit-
tee finished more than five weeks
early.

" [The provost] is in confidential
discussion with the candidates,"
said Helfand, assistant to the

Helfand added that news is not
expected for at least a week and a

selection date.

Last April, Maher organized a
search committee of 11 — eight fac-
ulty, one undergraduate student, one
graduate student and one staff repre-
sentative. The former SGB President
Justin DalMolin, did not participate,
leaving just 10 people to pare down
a list of 97 applicants for FAS dean.

In October, the selection com-
mittee interviewed 13 quarterfinal-
ists, whose names they kept confi-
dential. The names of six semifinal-
ists were then released in November.

FURKA

officer training program for the
University of Illinois and serves as an
instructor for police training in Ohio and
New Jersey.

She said she will have to evaluate
the Pitt Police Department when she
gets here to see if a program similar to
the one she developed for the University
of Illinois will be necessary.

Furka is the first woman to be
appointed police chief at Pitt, according
to Moses.

"There are only 50 women police
chiefs in the US, out of 15,000 jobs,"
Furka said. "So I approach the job a pro-
fessional."

She added that Pitt has a higher per-
centage of women officers than men.

"It's commendable," she said. "It
shows that Pitt hires the best qualiﬁed
people as officers, not just men because
it's traditionally a men's job."

But, she said that wasn't a factor in
her wanting to come to Pitt.

Furka said that she applied for the
Pitt job for two major reasons.

First, she said, she utilized the Pitt
Police Department for help on a case last
summer and was impressed with its pro-
fessional and timely service.

The second factor that drew her to
the job was a personal one.

She is originally from Stubenville,
Ohioand she said that getting the job
was a return home for her.

"I still have a lot of family that live
in the area, so I will be close to them
again," she said.

Furka said she has a connection to
the area since she grew up near here. ln
addition, she is familiar with the
Oakland area.

"I used to come to Oakland when I
was young, to see Roberto Clemente
play at Forbes Field," she said.

Furka said that she feels fortunate to
have found a working situation that is
desirable on both the professional and
personal levels.

"It's a win-win situation," she said.

For all those students who haven’t already start-

1 ed a phony student organization and siphoned a few

hundred dollars out of the activities fund, it may be

1 too late.

The Office of Student Activities, in a wise deci-

: sion and change of direction, has finally initiated a

“""~ “" """'“~lr""""'” *"'v-9'-V‘ ~v-ve-vs?-M ""- twr c-o~u.o--cm-,~nr v-w-wy-gm»-,-;s_—~:-.._.m. .4».-........, ~. . ..

thorough revamping of the SGB Allocations System.
Changes have been scheduled for everything, from
how allocations is to be run over the summer, to
what proof will be required for expenses, to abolish-
ing the automatic $325 recruitment budget that used
to be awarded to non-govemance groups‘. .
Actually, with all the imminent changes, it might

make some wonder what SGB members could have

had to talk about at the Orlando conference in
December, where they were supposed to lead a sem-
inar on the “exceptional student-facilitated alloca-
tions process,” as they phrased it.

On the other hand, they probably felt justified in
believing the old process was “exceptional.” Even
after the Office of Student Activities reviewed a
spending-spree summer for the SGB and admitted
that the SGB president and allocations chair had
exercised poor judgment, Student Activities Director
Joe Cavalla said there were no plans to revamp what
he called a “solid allocations process.”

After the story broke last semester that then
Allocations Chair Gerald Klayman, along with a few
other students, allegedly embezzled several thou-
sand dollars, it should have been clear to everybody
that the process was not so solid after all.

The administration has also proven that it under-
stands the value of an informed public. Certain
details of the investigation of Klayman and a few
other students must be kept private because of a law
called the Buckley Amendment which protects stu-
dent privacy. Bob Gallagher, the vice—chancellor
for student affairs, has been very cooperative in
releasing the results of the investigation and the
changes that will now take place in the allocations
process.

News affects people. Even when the news seems
to be about somebody you don’t know being investi-
gated for something you don’t think you care about,
the repercussions can be quite serious, and they can
affect your life, too.

In this case, we have a new, tighter, more “solid”

A National Defense Panel,
commissioned by Congress, has
recently released a 94-page
report entitled “Transforming
Defense,” which recommends a
strategy that adjusts the U.S.
military from Cold War threats
to future security threats.

When masked behind
happy-go—lucky language, this
may seem all well and good.
However, the actual changes
proposed mark a continued
depletion in our military’s
power. The rapid weakening of
our forces calls into question the
current stance of our national
priorities.

One proposed change: the
Pentagon should move away
from its familiar assumption that
the armed forces must be able to
fight two major regional wars at
one time. Quite a convenient
idea considering that, due to
drastic cuts in defense, our
forces are no longer capable of
fighting two fronts anyway. This
should provide an easy justifica-

tion for Bill Clinton and his ‘

Democrats to push for more cuts
and deny any increases in fund-
ing.

How can this panel deny the
reality of current world affairs
and believe that two regional
wars will not occur in the

. future?

Consider Tonight’s Main
Event: Iraq vs. Iran, or Iraq vs.
Israel, or Iraq vs. everybody,
Israel vs. Palestine, China vs.
Taiwan, North Korea vs. South
Korea, North Korea vs. Japan,
and India vs. Pakistan. They are

all regional wars that could
break out, given a few stimulat-
ing events, at any moment —
now or twenty years down the
road.

Throw in the fact that we
have committed troops in South
Korea, Bosnia, and other places,
and that civil war can break out
almost instantly in many African
nations.

The United States could eas-
ily become involved in a two-
front war. The panel admits the
current reality of Iraqi and
Korean wars, however it under-
estimates this as a “low-proba-
bility scenario” that should soon
be obsolete.

The panel’s report perpetu-
ates the myth that America’s
likelihood of war has decreased
since the end of the Cold War. It
results in the thinking that our
military is too large and needs to
be cut.

With the current ease of
procuring nuclear weapons,
North Korea’s production of 15-
20 warheads a year may seem
small until we see one ﬂoating
on the Potomac, one on the
Hudson, and one on the
Allegheny.

Another tidbit: the Russian
mafia’s trading of plutonium
certainly has not increased
nuclear safety, either. Beyond
nuclear threats, the prospects of
non—nuclear war as described
above have remained at the
same level since the Cold War.

This has not deterred liber-
als from hacking away at the
defense budget. Since 1988, 97
military bases have been or will
be closed, representing a one-
third cut in military strength. In

THE PITT NEWS

a few years, our anti—ICBM sys-
tem (which enables the U.S. to
shoot down and eliminate any
incoming nuclear intercontinen-
tal ballistic missiles) will cease
to be operational.

The panel has also fallen
into the same liberal trap that
ensnares many people: the belief
that the future of the world
involves everyone holding
hands and joining together in
one big, loving, universal gov-
ernment. This represents an
impossible goal dreamed up by
the ﬂower-child generation.

As our federal government
continues, as it has for the past
70 years — to diversify,
expand, and explore new
avenues of social engineering
and government control — it
risks abandoning its most
important responsibility: provid-
ing a capable defense not only of
American soil, but of American
interests abroad. The federal
government currently spends
more on each of Medicare,
Social Security and just the
interest on the national debt than
it spends on the defense budget.
The necessary question stands:
which of these four is the feder-
al govemment most justified in
funding? ,

Medicare? Even though
only a small number of people
actually benefit from Medicare,
what did people do before this
program? Charities would pay
for some medical bills. Doctors,
quite often, would do work for
free. And Grandma, when she
was old and unable to live inde-
pendently, would be taken in by

Have you given up on those pesky ‘resolutions’ yet?

If an automobile salesman ﬂips the

but for some reason if the Roman’s
Julian calendar declares the year to be
roughly 10 billion years off, it’s a rea-
son to party. Yes, please allow me to be
among the first persons who don’t even
pretend to know the words to ‘‘Auld
Lang Syne” to welcome you into 1998.

By now, I surmise that your New
Year’s hangover is at least to the point
where sneezes no longer sound like a
cozy afternoon in a Boeing jet—engine
test chamber, so the time has come. It’s
time to stand up to your responsibili-
ties.

Responsibilities such as finding out
to how you woke up on Jan. 1 wearing
a torn mechanic’s outfit coated in
honey and pine needles.
Responsibilities such as ﬁnding out
the heck “Cletus” is.
Responsibilities such as making sure
no one gets ahold of the negatives from
the early hours of the New Year.

And, yes, especially the responsi-
bility of facing up to that list of resolu-
tions you wrote down while in a state
of mind in which you wouldn’t have
minded -— or noticed -—— if someone
removed your appendix with a grape-
fruit spoon. .

The activation of New Year’s reso-

THE PITT NEWS

lutions is one of the
few times when the
eastern states are actu-
ally legally ahead of
California on anything
(even if it is only "by
three hours) so I
encourage you to
exploit this advantage.

Now some easy ways out of this
annual predicament are to simply post
bail, claim temporary insanity or flee
the planet at roughly the speed of light,
which should relatively stop earth time
for you. The rest of us will prove,
through some pseudo-masochistic
yearly ritual, that we can bring our-
selves one step closer to perfection (or,
if nothing else, mental and/or physical
hospitalization).

‘ One of the best ways to determine
what it is you should either give up, or
take up, as a healthy habit, can be easi-
ly determined through everyday obser-
vations. For example, if you have trou-
ble curbing your smoking habit at such
times as while you shower or give live
birth, you may consider resolving to
quit. Having more stamps laced with
illegal narcotics than it takes to send,
say, an Abrams tank to Guatemala,
should also trigger a red light.

overhear people mak-
ing comments to the
effect of “Hmm, I think
I may collapse in con-
vulsions and uncontrol-
lably retch all over
myself from that
smell,” when you stroll into a room.
Another classic tip—off to a correctable
problem is hearing “Hey, how much,
sweet-cheeks?” every time you walk
into religious buildings.

Giving up a bad habit is inarguably
beneﬁcial: having that extra cookie,
designing an arsenal of biological
weaponry in your basement, and regu-
larly dining on human ﬂesh, for
instance. On the other hand, you may
wish to consider making active
changes to your life such as picking up
exercising, extending a warm greeting
to strangers, or donating all of your
John Tesh and Michael Bolton CDs to
the U.S. Department of Defense’s psy-
chological warfare department.

However, before you jump out of
your seat and scream, “I vow to over-

your home state’s individual regula-

Time magazine ran a list
of its “winners and losers” of
1997, praising some people
and accomplishments while
mocking others. _

In itself, not a bad idea.

However, among the win-

listed the Mars Pathfinder

ognize a remarkable feat of
science, the notebook man-
aged to slip in a jab at science
types.

The exact words were:
“Live pictures from Mars.
Another amazing triumph for

All through grade school
and high school, I knew kids
who refused to take any inter-

est in science, because they
equated it with nerddom.

Television and other
media sources have enforced
this attitude. Watch the

Saturday morning cartoons for
a few weeks, and look for the
scientists portrayed to kids in
these half—hour babysitters:
They will almost certainly be
either wild—eyed evil scien-

American kids are taught

they won’t be cool otherwise.

‘Pitt gets lesson
in postseason

football

Pitt may have soundly lost the 1997
Liberty Bowl 41-7, but the program and
zthe school gained an invaluable experi-
ence.

For the program it was a first—day-of-
school lesson in post-season play. The
month off between games smudged some
of the shine the team glearned with after
i)ack—to—back wins against Virginia Tech
and West Virginia to end the season.
Senior receiver Jake Hoffart admitted that
it was hard for the seniors to set an exam-
ple for the rest of the team because they
had never been to a bowl game either.

In theory, playing in late December
should be the same as any mid—season bat-
Lle with Notre Dame or Rutgers, but in
reality it’s not. Media coverage can expo-
nentially increase like the tabloids on the
cries of Michael Jackson’s next illegiti-
mate child or the next cloned farm animal.

And a month off between games can
not only test a player’s focus, but also his
ability to regain the same intensity level
from the end of the season. This was not
Edie same Pitt team that won six games, but
:unfortunately its alter ego. The team that

llost to Temple, Boston College and almost
i_Rutgers made the ﬂight to Memphis.

It played hard when down only 14-7
at the half, but Southern Mississippi was
gust a better all-around team. Coach Walt
Harris felt much the same as Hoffart, say-
ing that this program has to leam how to

ilay in bowl games.

Now, with a post-season game under
its belt, next year’s squad will leam from
-his year and be ready for its next bowl
game environment. This doesn’t mean
ghat fans should expect a trip to the
Diange Bowl next year, but for a new pro-
‘gram to make it to a bowl game in its ﬁrst
gt/ear under a new coach is a feat
unmatched by such college icons as Joe
?atemo, 5-5 in his ﬁrst year, and Lou
floltz, 5-6 in his.

 For the school and its fans, the
Liberty Bowl ended an eight-year wait to
show some Pitt pride to the rest of the
ttountry. Thousands of Pitt fans bused,
glrove or ﬂew to Tennessee for the game
and its festivities.

Memphis, Tenn. — Anticlimax.

It isn’t often that a football‘

game can be summed up in one word,
but for the Pittsburgh Panthers — a team
that rose from last-place expectations to
a 6-5 regular-season record — the 1997
AXA Equitable Liberty Bowl served as
an anticlimax.

The University of Southern
Mississippi Golden Eagles, champions
of Conference USA, welcomed the
Panthers to the south with a 41-7 demo-
lition. Three defensive touchdowns in
the second half — two coming off Pete
Gonzalez interceptions and one from a
Billy West fumble — were more than
enough to end Pitt’s two-game win
streak.

“I think it’s the toughest [defen-
sive] scheme we’ve faced,” Gonzalez
said. “Some of the best teams in the
country have had trouble, and we came
in and we struggled.”

The Southern Miss defense
struggled first, when Pitt took the open-
ing kickoff and drove into USM territo-
ry. Gonzalez, the second—team all-con-
ference quarterback for the Big East this
season, personally picked up two early
third-down conversions, once with a

well-timed ﬂoater to tight end Juan

contest, and instead of the long field
goal or the short punt, he decided to go
for it.

. ball back on
downs, and in
less than three
minutes, drove

game’s first score.

The scoring play — a 31-yard
pass from Lee Roberts to Sherrod
Gideon — was the first of three Roberts-
to-Gideon scores on the day. The three
touchdowns by one receiver was a
Liberty Bowl record, as the USM
sophomore ran around Pitt comerbacks
Chuck Brown and Hank Poteat for
much of the contest.

Ham's explained that the pow-
erful rumiing game of USM -—- Harold
Shaw Conference USA’s leading
ground—gainer with 1,045 yards —
forced the Panthers to single-cover
Gideon. When Pitt defensive back John
Jenkins, a free safety who spent most of
his day near the line of scrimmage look-
ing for Shaw, was asked about Gideon,
he kept it simple.

“He was up to the challenge,”
Jenkins said. “He’s a great receiver and
a great athlete and obviously he showed
that today.” Gideon had over 100 yards
receiving by the end of the third quarter.

The Eagles’ star receiver wasn’t
the only wideout that set a Liberty Bowl
record on the afternoon. With the score
14-0 and Pitt faced with third-and-12 at
its own 11-yard line, Gonzalez hit
Panther star receiver Jake Hoffart with a
short pass.

Hoffart was covered by USM
comer Terrace Panish, who, after the
Pitt senior caught the ball, promptly fell
over. '

This left Hoffart in a position
the receiver rarely dealt with in the reg-
ular season -— an open ﬁeld ahead of
him. Instead of meeting four defenders
the second he caught the ball, Hoffart
went nearly untouched down the left

Liberty Bowl loss caps
a surprising season

Ned Schano
Senlor Staff Wrlter

The Pitt Panthers started the
1997 season with new uniforms,
a new head coach and a new ath-
letics director. They started with
a new offense, a new defense
and an unproven quarterback.
But most importantly, they start-
ed the season with a new atti-
tude that erased the memory of a
15-41 record over the previous
ﬁve seasons.

While 1997 was a season of
rebirth for the program, it unfor-
tunately ended on a sour note,
with a 41-7 shellacking. at the
hands of Southern Mississippi in
the Liberty Bowl.

While the debacle proved
that Pitt still has a lot more
improvements to make in its
quest to become a major bowl
team, the bowl loss should in no
way diminish the memories of a
groundbreaking season.

Simply going to a bowl
seemed like a far—fetched dream
at the outset of the season. The
fact that Pitt won six games and
earned its first bowl birth in

eight years was a feat that many
thought was impossible.
Actually winning the game
would have been icing on what
proved to be a very sweet 1997

. season.

Pitt played competitively
the first half. Jake Hoffart’s 89-
yard touchdown strike gave life
to the Panthers and narrowed the
Southern Miss lead to 14-7.
John Jenkins’ pick snuffed
another drive, preventing the
Golden Eagles from expanding
their lead. VV1th the Panthers
down only one score at the end
of the second quarter, the impos-
sible dream —— winning a bowl
game -— was close to reality. '\

The Panthers went into the
locker room at halftime with
conﬁdence. They trailed the
21st-ranked Eagles by just
seven points, and seemed to
have ﬁgured out Southern Miss’
confusing multiple defenses and
its offense’s rushing attack.

But by the end of the third
quarter, it became quite apparent
that Pitt was ‘outmatched by
Southern Miss. The ﬂood gates

possession as a Billy West fum-
ble was returned for a touch-
down making the score 21-7.

The Golden Eagle defense
took control in the fourth quar-
ter. Two interceptions returned
for touchdowns within a three-
minute span proved to be one
mountain that the 1997 football
team could not overcome.

The Panthers top-notch
offense was stiﬂed by the
Golden Eagles defense, which
held Pitt to 340 yards total
offense while scoring three
defense touchdowns.

Balich leads Panthers in Big East upset

Kevin Lilley
sports Edltor

A Big East women’s basketball
game at the Fitzgerald Field House
last night ended in a blowout, with one
side leading the other in nearly every
offensive and defensive category.

And for the ﬁrst time all season,
the Pitt Lady Panthers weren’t the vic-
tims. Behind Alecia Balich’s team-
leading 19 points and a strong perfor-
mance ﬁom junior shooting guard
Gina Montesano, the Panthers (5-7)
scored their ﬁrst conference victory of
the season, a 66-56 upset of the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights.

“Maybe, just maybe, we’re start-
ing to gel a little bit,” said Pitt Head
Coach Kirk Bruce. Bruce’s Panthers
were 0-4 in conference matchups
before Tuesday’s contest, dropping
close matches to Syracuse and
Vrllanova in recent weeks.

Balich made her olfensive push
from olf the bench in the contest, but
just barely: she subbed for Montesano
just 19 seconds into the game, and
scored ﬁve points in Pitt’s game-open-
ing 10-0 run. She had 11 points in the
ﬁrst half, nine coming from three-
pointers.

Bruce attributed Balich’s and
Montesano’s scoring performances to
pre—garne shooting workouts. Both

Pitt standouts came
in before the game
to work on their
shots, with
Montesano ﬁring
balls oﬂ° the rack as
early as two in the
afternoon.

It showed.
Early in the second
half, with the
Panthers behind 34-
30, Montesano sank
a jumpshot from
just within the
three—point arc to
put Pitt within two.
Tearmnate Nickeia
Morris scored on
the next possession
to tie the game, and
Montesano hit
another two to put
the Panthers ahead.

Both of the Pitt
junior’s shots came
from the same spot
on the ﬂoor. Her

Nine Balich’s

next came from six inches behind that
spot — an arching three-pointer that
was followed by a Balich jumper.
Another Rutgers tumover gave
the Panthers one more offensive
opportunity and gave Montesano
another open look. Like she was still

in shooting practice, the guard took a

Men's hoops scores
revenge in South Bend

Eric Mosley

 

Staff Wrlter

Uncharacteristic of a young basketball squad that is
struggling to earn victories, Ralph Wr1lard’s club bent but
did not break last night during Pitt’s Big East match-up with
N otre Dame.

The Panthers avoided a late Notre Dame scare and
exacted a little measure of revenge last night, earning their
ﬁrst Big East victory of the season, defeating the Fighting
Irish, 72-61 in South Bend

The Panthers controlled most of the game and enjoyed
a 16 point lead, 61-45, following sophomore J anett
Lockhart’s three-pointer. But the Fighting Irish lived up to
their nickname, and fought, scratched and clawed their way
back into the game, cutting Pitt’s 16 point lead to ﬁve with
less than four minutes remaining.

However, the young Panther squad kept its composure
during Notre Darne’s late run. Freshman Attila Cosby, who
ﬁnished with nine points, hit a key jumper at the 3:53 mark
to stop the Panther bleeding.

“I was pleased that we showed a little poise down the
stretch,” Willard said. "That is nice to see from a young
team that’s been struggling. The kids bore down, fought the
crowd and won the game. That shows we are growing as a
team”

Notie Dame jumped out to an early 9-4 lead, but
sophomore forward Isaac Hawkins, who ﬁnished with 18
points, scored eight of Pitt’s ﬁrst 10 points to keep the game
close.

“Isaac did an unbelievable job for us tonight,” Willard
said

ers (my personal favorite) ﬂoated down
the six block procession.

That night, it was truly an inspiring
sight to witness Pitt fans overﬂowing into
the streets, bars and night clubs of
Memphis in their Pitt garb and yellow “I
Believe” stickers.

In one such watering hole on Beale
Street, Pitt Athletics Director Steve
Pederson was coaxed onto stage by some
jubilant alumni. Before he could speak, a
student shouted out “Thanks for the tick-
ets Steve” and the crowd, made up of
mostly students, erupted with Bruce
Springsteen-like cheers of “Steve, Steve,
Steve.” ,

After the vociferous crowd settled a

little, Pederson took the microphone and
spat off a speech about how wonderful it
was to see all these Pitt students and fans
ﬁnally having something to be proud of
again.
He ﬁnished his address with a
remarkable quote, “There are some people
saying we shouldn’t be here and we don’t
deserve this bowl game.” The crowd qui-
eted and then he answered with, “But, all
I have to say to them is there are 100 or so
schools at home watching us play.’’

The crowd again erupted into cheers.

There was very little for Panther fans
to cheer about at the game, however, with
the exception of Hoffart’s 89-yard touch-
down catch near the end of the first half.
But fans were just happy to be in
Memphis. 1

Pitt ﬁnished the season at 6-6. The

Wednesday, 7 January 1998

blow-out in the Liberty Bowl slightly tar-
nishes Pitt’s 6-5 regular season record. On
top of that, the Big East’s record in bowl
games was 0-4.

Coach Harris made a lot of sense in
his post—ga.me interviews when he talked
about this being the ﬁrst year of a new pro-
gram. The more years a coaching staff is
together, the better the whole system runs.
This is true for every facet of college foot-
ball from recruiting to play calling.

Memphis may have not been the sto-
rybook ending to this season Pitt fans
desired, but gave Harris and company a
few more years with this program and
those Vegas Gold jerseys will always be
playing on New Year’s day.

Matt Townsend is the Assistant Sports
Editor for The Pitt News.

LIBERTY

"sideline, sidestepping Golden Eagles

and diving into the end zone for an 89-
yard touchdown.

It was the longest touchdown
pass in Liberty Bowl history, and the
longest for Pitt this season. The end zone
dive cost the Panthers 15 yards — the
referee ruled it was an unnecessary cele-
bration.

"Hoffart wasn’t so sure.

“I kind of felt like people were
on me,” he said. “I felt tired, I was excit-
ed, I don’t know how to explain it.”

He did say that he felt the call

was unwarranted, but Chris Ferencik

nailed the extra-long extra-point to
make the controversy pointless. The
score was 14-7, and stayed that way
until the third quarter.

The play would be the lone
highlight for the Panthers, as Gonza1ez’s
offense became its own worst enemy.
On Pitt’s first possession of the second
half, West fumbled a Gonzalez handoff
on the first play from scrimmage.
USM’s Perry Phenix recovered the fum-
ble and ran 15 yards for an Eagle touch-
down.

After another Gideon touch-
down, USM’s Adalius Thomas inter-
cepted a Gonzalez screen pass and took
it for a 26-yard touchdown. After the

ensuing kickoff, Panish intercepted a
Gonzalez pass and returned it 63 yards
for the ﬁnal score of the day.

Junior Matt Lytle replaced
Gonzalez on the next Pitt possession;
the senior quarterback ﬁnished his Pitt
career with a 13-for-29, l72—yard per-
formance. .

Harris complimented Gonzalez,
Jenkins, West, and all the other Pitt
Seniors on their play throughout the sea-
son, saying the program and the
University owe the class of 1998 for the

1997 bowl experience.

“Ninety percent of the Pitt fans
out there will be forever indebted to our
seniors and what they have done for us,”
Harris said.

Still, despite the positives and
the thank-yous at the post-game press
conference, the coach made it clear that
he had other, better endings in mind for
the Panthers’ season.

“I would describe this as a
tough day at the office,” he said. “My
worst dream became a nightmare.”

Wednesday, 7 January 1998

VVHOOPS

“That’s the kind of effort that wins you
games.”

Montesano and fellow guards
Michelle Katkowski and LaTonya Blanton
showed a similar effort on defense, pen-
ning in Scarlet Knight freshman Natasha
Pointer for the evening. Pointer, who aver-
ages 13.5 points per game for Rutgers, was
held to just four by the Panthers, and fouled
out with 30 seconds to go in the contest.

Bruce pointed to the foul trouble of
Pointer and LaTana Lillard as key reasons
for the Panther victory. Usually a 40-
minute player, Pointer ﬁnished the game
with only 32 minutes thanks to early reach-
in calls.

“I would hate to have to sit Gina for
eight minutes,” Bruce said.

The win gives the Panthers momen-
tum as they head into the meat of their con-
ference schedule. Pitt squares olf against
Big East foe West Virginia on Thursday in
Morgantown, then comes home next
Wednesday to battle third—raiiked
Connecticut at the Field House.

Bruce suggested that the win over
Rutgers may serve as a wake-up call to
future opponents, especially the
Mountaineers.

“I’m sure when they see this score,
they’re going to look at the box score again
to make sure it’s not a typo,” Bruce said.
