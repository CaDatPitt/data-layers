An Editorial ,
Vote Yes Today  

HETHER OR NOT Pitt will have a new student government
will be decided at the polls today as the student-body is asked
to approve the by-laws of the new setup. Followin§7g=s'e,veral months’
work on the new plan, the special committee of stuiieiits and faculty
members presented the by-laws of the new form te Student council
last week. Student council passed the by-laws unanimously and has
turned over the fate of Pitt ’s governmental change: to the hands of
student voters. 
The Pitt News urges every student to vote YESitoday. It is the
duty of every student to approve the new form bf government, a
form which represents a vast improvement over  for-in Pitt stu-
dents have ever attempted. It represents the coiichntratecl effort of
14 student leaders and faculty members. 

Three outstanding features among many  mentioned in
favor of the new setup. First, it does away with ;ntei*11al elections,
thus eliminating a bone of contention which  icausecl political
strife on the campus for many years. V?‘ 5

Second, it insures minority representation by

&:i,lOVw'll1g' a student

to vote for only four candidates. The large nuiiibeifwho will become ,
members of the University assembly insure that  clique will con-’

trol the group.

Third, it is a University organization, interested mainly in the
welfare of the entire University. 

The by-laws of the Student-Faculty association?‘ of the University
MUST be passed today. This is the ONE opport.u€nity for a change
in campus government for which Pitt students harfe been clamoring
for years. Vote today and VOTE YES. 3'

I John P, Bracken, C34, said: “I

A Noi, Ducel

N CAREFULLY-VEILED terms Italy’s Il Duce an-

nounces the aims of his party for the next 65 years.
Territorial expansion into Asia. and Africa. are named by
Mussolini as the goals of the Fascist party by the year
2000. Stating that it is illusory for nations to believe
Germany could be kept disarmed, andlreiterating his
promise to help Austria, the Fascist chief lays open his
entire philosophy to anyone who cares examine it.

For arguments sake let us state the motive powers be-
hind the actions of the Italian dictator.

1. First and above all, Mussolini considers himself
important. He is interested in becoming a ﬁgure in his-
tory, :1 Napoleon or a Caesar.

2. He insists on playing upon a dying national emo-
tion—territorial expansion.

3. He promises to help Austria because were Germany
to get control of that nation Mussolini‘s easy access to
Czechoslovakia would be barred.

4. He supports arms and war because on arms and
war is his Fascist empire founded.

5. He refuses to look upon himself and Fascism as
stepping stones in the world’s progress toward inevitable
collectivism and will probably become a blockade to this
progress when it comes about.

Italy’s position in the Mediterranean Sea which is re-
gaining its historic function, according to the Duce, of
connecting the East and West is a point a little too far-
stretched by the ambitious dictator. In the history of the
in the hey-day of Genoa and
Naples that might have been Italy’s function, but today
Instead,

A’ she must accept her position as another nation in a World

of similar nations trying to make the best of things as
they come along.

Despite Mussolini’s methods of getting power in Italy,
his work in that country has been little short of remark-
able. He has established the nation’s credit, rebuilt its
cities, revitalized its self-esteem, built it up commercially
and politically, and has worked for the comparative com-
fort and well-being of the work—a-day Italian. VVere his
aims farther in this direction, Italy could ask little more
of him. But 11 Duce, like many others before him, is
making -the mistake of thinking himself important in
world history. That alone is enough to sound his death
knell, and perhaps the political death knell of Italian
Fascism.

Expansion into Africa would be met with violent oppo-
sition on the part of France. Expansions into Asia would
be met by opposition on the part of Russia. Any attempt
to bottle up the Mediterranean would arouse the wrath
primarily of Great Britain, and of other imperialist na-
tions. Expansion into the north of Europe would be fool-
hardy.

If Mussolini sincerely imagines himself the benefactor
of world civilization when he says, “The African re-
sources must be included more thoroughly in the world's
civilization,” he is either being sadly mistaken or an-
noyingly egotistic. Italy will owe him more if he stays
at home and looks after Italy.

Courses In Russian
ARLY IN JANUARY Dean Sieg of the College invited

students to discuss with him, individually or in
1-II‘011I)Ss the Dossibilities of curriculum revision. Several
hundred undergraduates vigorously applauded Dean
Sieg’s remarks, and immediately worked themselves into
the most profound apathy as far as constructive sugges-
tions were concerned. What students have in mind when
they plan their next semester’s schedule is still reckoned
in arbitrary terms of credits, majors, and minors. Con-
tent to take the courses now offered without questioning
the shifting values of an unstable age, Pitt men and
women have advanced no plan for curriculum change.
Yet they agree with the College Dean that “Something
should be done about our courses.”

The Pitt News, too, believes that “Something should be
done about our courses.” On its own initiative, it has
not worked out a comprehensive program of reform. That
is not the function of the student newspaper. But the
News does propose several speciﬁc changes, and awaits
student opinion, as mirrored in letters to the editor,
which will permit the paper to conduct an open forum
on this vital issue. Thus far, we have heard opposite
views presented on the always moot controversy of war
and peace. It has been said, and with justice, that at
last the American student is beginning to question the
unthinking patriotic spirit. In the year of the milennium.
1934, some declare that undergraduates are actually seek-
ing their way out of their economic dilemma without
senselessly repeating the shibboleths of our golden age.
Yet it is a strange commentary on Pitt students that,
concerned as they are with the problems of national re-
covery and world war, they ﬁnd no time whatsoever to
discuss their most immediate interest—-—their course of
study.

The News assumes no attitude of either superiority or
ﬁnality in presenting its recommendations. These sug-
gestions, coming as they do as an editorial viewpoint of
the newspaper, represent only a small minority of student

opinion. \Vith cooperation from our readers, we may
hope soon to know what course changes are most desired.

As our ﬁrst proposal, we recommend the establishment
of courses in Russian language and literature. Our rea-
sons for such a request are more complex than the recent
recognition of the U. S. S. R. by the United States. The
renewed friendship of the two great Powers has served
merely to crystallize the great fact: Soviet Russia is
playing an ever increasing part in world affairs. A
knowledge of its language and its history will soon be
essential to the liberal arts College graduate, whatever
his ﬁeld of specialization. In engineering, such Russian
projects as Magnitogorsk and Dnieperstroi are triumphs
of skill and fortitude. In broad social planning, no better
experimental ground exists than the Soviet Union in
general, or Stalingrad a.nd Cheliabinsk in particular. And
in literature, thereeis the magniﬁcent heritage of Tolstoi,
Dostoevski, and Turgeniev, as well as the new “proleta-
rian” movement whose leader is Maxim Gorki. I
. The editor of the Living Age has called the rapid
growth of the U. S. S. R. “the most important population
portent of our time.” He estimates that, at the present
rate of increase-3,000,000 each yea.r—Russia will in 1985
number 300,000,000 people. ‘Natler Duranty declares that
Russia is the coming center for mass immigration. These
two statements are indicative of the general truth. There
can be no denying the importance of the Soviet state.
Pitt students, if given the opportunity, would welcome
the knowledge of its language and of its culture.

To The Vanquished . . .
RIMMING OVER with righteous indignation, Ameri-
can industrialists are staging a re-markable ﬁght to
stave off the advance of labor. Theirs is the battle to
support the philosophy that the capitalist is still the
leader. Theirs is the conﬂict to determine whether this
same capitalist will continue to be» the leader,

Recent disturbances in the labor ranks of the automo-
bile and steel industries, if they have done anything,
have succeeded in showing the clever, intelligent organi-
zation of the industrialist who maintains that no “out-
side” labor leader will take the control of his business
away from him. - V .

Full-page advertisements in the nation’s press have
done much to indicate that the nations automobile man-
ufacturers are strongly grouped in their National Auto-
mobile Chamber of Commerce. Three other powerful
groups which have consistently opposed labor provisions
of the NRA are The National Association of Manufac-
turers, the Iron and Steel Institute, and the powerful
bankers of the nation.

L93d€‘1‘1‘-‘SS 1‘r1-I301‘ groups are impotently striking their
heads against this solid wa.11_ Even the professional
1€~"1deI‘ShiD afforded by the A F of L is lacking in strategy
sufficient to ably draw together the nation’s labor groups.
Strike maneuvers, even those directed by the ablest of
these “professional” men, show the lack of technique
which, coupled With the organization of the industrialist,
has served to offer considerable opposition to labor’s ad-
Vance.

the “"01"k91‘S they Will camouﬂage their intentions will

ﬁve hundred dollars to spare.

The Cap and Gown show would have girls in the cast.
What the Pitt lassies could do in “big time” if they were
glV€Il a chance is plenty.

Most student “conferences” would be labeled with
Bacon’s pithy crack, “fruitful of controversies and barren

Pd t111"0tt1e guys like Charlie Ruch (man. ed. of the
Panther, alleged humorous mag) who, when asked what
be’d do if he were the Stalin of Pitt, replied, “1’d quit
Stalin!”

Girlies like Jean Howard would get 100,000 American
dollars to help them along in that great cause—clipping
cooking recipes from a downtown paper. I

Fraternities would get half a million to remodel their
shacks which are “fraternity houses” but far from “fra-
ternity homes.”

One thousand dollars would be given for every worth-
while social, political, or economic idea, whether it came
from a professor or a student.

And while this generous mood lasts, every professor of
merit would travel as much as he cared, with all ex-
penses paid, for research in his ﬁeld.

The board of trustees would be enriched by the youth-
ful personality of a graduate every five years. This man
would be picked as the most successful man in his class
of five years ago.

A real printing plant would be built on the boulevard
side of the Cathedral and would make the- college paper
a daily, the college comic mag a bi-weekly, and the Owl
twice as big and costing half as much.

Restaurants which substitute pork when they run out
of chicken would be made to substitute chicken when

they run out of pork.

Grades and “cuts” would be abolished and nobody
would get a diploma. And you wouldn’t need hiskool
credits to get in the Uni which is interested in Men, not
MUMMIES

I would erect two huge statues of Pitt’s panther on
each side of the main entrance of the Cathedral, just to
show we're proud of our mascot.

Men’s and women's lounges wouldn’t be separated. W’e
ought to be grown up by now.

Two bright students would be on the committee which
passes on Cap and Gown skits and I’d see if. the com-
mittee could tell the difference between mine and one of
Noel C0ward’s.

Three big dances that ALL students could afford
would be scheduled each year. Yes, even to suit the
purse of the fellow who eats the two sandwiches and one
apple that mom packs for his lunch.

Everyone, not a mere handful, would meet and know
Chancellor Bowman! And Dr. Ralph E. Turner!

Girls like the cheerful-voiced young lady who runs
the Uni phone board would be placed in all University
ofﬁces. I

A whole floor of the Cathedral would house a founda-
tion where justice-starved citizens could tell their trou-
bles to an interested committee. AND_ SOMETHING
WOULD BE DONE ABOUT THEM!

And students who “know” how to solve all the world’s
problems-would be made to run ONE student activity
for a week—and they'd be human beings again! ! !!

THE PITT WS
:55

  Effl uvia

Campus politicians are a little to be pitied in their at-
tempts to be “big time stuff.” For instance, meetings of
all school organizations are carried on in a ‘wistful at-
tempt to conform to parliamentary procedure, but inva-
riably, when a point of contention is reached, the would-
be Gladstones lapse into the language of their childhood
and substitute personalities for platitudes.

Fraternitypolitics also may be carried to a hopeless
extreme of favoritism or pitiful incompetence for busi-
ness. Any attempt on the part of fraternities to herd to-
gether for the common good is kept in the dark as much
as possible with the result that everyone knows every-

thing. Activities are “managed” by the best fraternities,’

according to non-activities students and‘ misled members
ofthe fraternities. In reality, most students get the
wrong idea entirely about fraternity politics, monopoli-
zation, coalitions, campus favoritism and nearly every-
thing else outside the curriculum.

It may be Utopian, but wouldn’t it be better for all
concerned if Pitt politicians tried to emulate those in
other universities? Student government in many schools
is admittedly controlled by certain factions, but the con-
trol is permitted because such groups actually have good
intentions and laudable results. Should they prove un-
worthy, other factions quickly rise to ﬁll the breach and
it is to guard against this that those in power must “be-
have.”

Because Pitt is so thoroughly metropolitan, there are
few fraternities in comparison to the large number of
students enrolled; yet these few organized groups could
easily control campus politics and functions if they were
banded together more wisely and not too well. The new
student government plan for Pitt falls in with tenden-
cies for “New Deals” all over the country. Fraternities
can not be eliminated from such movements, and a
proper suggestion at present may be that the fraterni-
ties give themselves a new deal also. Student council
may have its faults, but in the absence of anything else,
what could be expected? The average University stu-
dent, who is non-fraternity and involved in few if any
activities, scarcely knows the functions of this august
body. W

Omer E. Kronenwetter, Guest Columnist

Hence, with a new deal all around, the fraternities
might beneﬁt themselves and the student body, student
government might amount to something more than a.
group to be termed a farcical organization existing only
for the--good of its members, and the uninterested stu-
dent might actually become attracted to do something
besides drifting along, following the line of least resist-
ance. All of which, as I have said, sounds quite Utopian.

* =!¢ * ti: 3:

The recent so-called outburst of propaganda against
the National Student league is another pathetic gesture.
In keeping with its policy of sensationalism, one of the
downtown newspapers published a broadside which gave

readers a false impression of the trend of thought in

our institutions of higher education.

Of course. the public wants to frown on these irre-
sponsible college children, but usually there is little
about which to complain.
and women who go to college are not the rah—rah freaks
found in movies and cheap literature. Now if they
should do something against the flag, the country and
the good of the people, all would be right; sober and
austere grown-ups would have something to condemn
and cheap journalists could pound out hundreds of decla-
matory articles. . . ’

As it is, there is a National Student league, whose
functions are not too clear in the mind of the public.
Furthermore, popular sentiment is decidedly anti-Russian
and consequently anti-socialistic. The fact that ‘?the
league is inactive at most schools and practically ide-
funct at Pitt and Carnegie Tech could na.turally" have
little influence in the matter. Such a story is too good
to kill. ’  "

Thus, asvin other minor student uprisings, the pa:p_.ers
can give the avid public something to devour, something
to talk and cluck tongues about. At last these artful
students have been discovered to be ruining the coun-
try! After all these years they prove all that has been
thought about them. And so the newspapers smirk, and
the condemnatory public frowns, and the innocent stu-
dent only wonders what it’s all about and why he has_n’t
been told about it. ‘ -

The new plan would provide for a cooperating Student-Faculty associatioii.

orgaiiizatioiis. Your committee began
work on the present plan with the fol-
lowing objectives in mind:

1. That the emphasis should
be upon the University rather
than upon any individual school,
activity or other component part
of the University.

2. To give the faculty and stu-
dents an opportunity to work co-
operatively on common univer-
sity problems.

Women To See And Sigh
Over The Newest
Of.'New Styles

You can decide whether you
want a wind-blown chiffon formal
or a Mexicana evening gown, a
new spring boat or a tweed suit,
a new riding habit or a ribbed
bathing suit, as eight young wo-
men model these and many other
styles at the fashion show at
Heinz House on Vvednesday, April
4, at 1:45 o'clock.

The social unit, not to be out-
distanced by the other units of
an active freshman class, has ar-
ranged with Boggs and Bulil’s to
have new spring and summer
styles modeled for the feminine
contingent of the student body.
Knowing the woman's love of
clothes, Arlene Cupples, cliairnian
of the committee for the show,
believes there will be a large num-
ber of the co-eds present. Fran-
ces McLaughlin, fashion editor of
the Pitt Panther, will describe
the important points of the cos-
tumes. A

All women on the campus are
invited and there is no admission
charge.

“Is it cut in big enough

It used to be said, and for all we know, it is still being said that Cooks
Tours (no adv.) take you all over the world, if you can afford it. Naturally,
no college coach can hope to duplicate the services performed by such an
agency as Cooks (same thing), but Doctor H. C. Carlson has done quite well
and rightly by his baskel’ball team during the last three years, and has taken
the boys to and through practically every state in the Union.

Three lads, graduating in June, or at least finishing their career
at that time (they may be Dents) have participated in these trips
since their sophomore year, beginning with the trip to California in
1931, and ending with the Southern trip, now under way. These for-
tunate three are Russ Ochsenhirt, Don Mccamant, and Charley
Hughes.

The map of the United States, shown in this column shows better than
any words possibly could, the traveling that has been done. by these three,
and the members of the basketball squad during the past three years. Start-
ing from Pennsylvania (in black, although it is said to be in ‘‘red’’) the Carl-
son-coaclied machines have traveled from coast to coast. Only the fact
that Maine was not visited prevents this column from starting out with,
“Froni the rock-bound coast of ‘Maine to the sun-kissed shores of Califor-
nia,” because, you see, the boys have visited sunny California.

During their wanderings, the Carlson teams have met, and usu-
ally defeated, such teams as Northwestern, Butler, Purdue, West
Point, Annapolis, Boston University, Wisconsin, Notre Dame, Indi-
aha, Colorado U., University of Kansas, California, Western Reserve,
Stanford, Marquette, Ohio State, Nebraska, Creighton, Iowa, West
Virginia, and the Southern schools that the boys are on their way to
meet now, namely, DeKalb Teachers and Duke University. Unfor-
tunately, the human mind (at least this human’s) is unable to accu-
rately recall ALL of the teams that have faced the Panthers on
their tours, but the above will give you a rough idea of where a
Pitt basketball team travels.

The basketball team is welcome wherever it goes, despite the
fact that they usually spoil their welcome by winning the game.
The fact that they are welcome even while victorious is a fine tri-
bute to Doctor Carlson and the great teams he coaches. Incidentally,
it gives the boys a great chance to stock up on labels in case they
missed them on a previous trip.

Few, if any schools can boast of such an itinerary. To make matters
better, every year is a good year for travel as far as the basketball team
is concerned. To make their trip more enjoyable they are “chaperoned”
by the best of them all, Doc Carlson.

Out of the 48 states, conimonwealths, etcetera, that make up this
country, only those unmarked in the map above have failed to have the
Pantliers as their guests. Those states unmarked, save for name, are the
unfortunate ones that have not seen the Panthers step out on the floor, run
up a score, and then treat the folks to a display of non—skid passing that
“stopped the show.”

The opportunity fortravel that-is offered by the basketball team
can not be duplicated in any college in the country, as far as this cor-
ner has been able to discover. And as far as taht goes, the brand of
coaching at Pitt cannot be duplicated either.

The Cheerleaders

I tried to keep this out of print, but I can't resist the temptation to “let
it go.” Quite a few people have asked why this column persists in “rid-
ing” the cheerleaders. VVe11, here is just one reason, and a swell one. It
seems that Pitt played VVestminster a while back, and at least 4,500 people
jammed the stadium pavilion to watch the carrying—ons. Just. as the game
was getting under way, one of the cheerleaders ran over to one _of the
NEWS reporters in the press box and inquired, “Who are we playing to-
night?” As I have said before, what this country needs
(I won't talk, much).

Trophy Offered
Indoor Relay
Victors, April 5

Fraternities To Enter Four Men
In Each Event; Thiessen
Heads Committee

The long-awaited interfraternity In-
door Relay Games, the winner of which
will get possession of the trophy re-
cently offered by the athletic depart-
ment, are scheduled for Thursday,
April 5, at the Track house. And great
will be the liniment sales in the Oak-
land drug stores, if the fraters are
as anxious to annex that trophy as
they seem to be.

To make the meet more of an affair
for the “average” fellow, the results
will be tabulated iii a manner dif-
ferent from any previously tried i11
interfraternity conipe-tition_ Four mem-
bers of each fraternity house must
be entered in each event. The records
made by each of the four entrants
will then be added together and the
average found. This average mark will
be the mark accredited to the fra-
ternity and ﬁrst, second and third
places will be awarded on this basis.
The point system is designed to keep
houses with one or two exceptional
performers from running off with the
meet.

As an added precaution against such
a turn of events, no member of a
fraternity who has won letters or
numerals with a Pitt track or cross-
country team or who is a member of
the present track squad will be el-
igible to compete. Thus the meet
will be directly in the hands of the
“average” fraternity man and this
factor is expected to add greatly to
the interest in the meet.

An added attraction to the events
will be an eight—1nan tug-of-war, with
a team representing each fraternity.
It is hoped that the winners will be
matched later on with a team made
up of faculty members to determine
whether the students or the pro-
fessors have the most pull.

’l‘he trophy to be presented to the
winners is on display in the Dean of
l\"le11’S office.

The formal rules for the games, as
released by Linwood Thiessen, Phi
Delta Theta, chairman of the affair,
follows:

1. No varsity track or cross-country
letter or numerals winner or member
of the present track squad, ineligible
to participate in intertraternity track_
Any man ineligible for varsity ath-
letics is eligible for fraternity track
competition.

2. No entrant who has participated
in one or more varsity or freshmen
meets in the current season shall be
allowed to compete.

3. Only active fraternity members
or pledges who are bonaﬁde under-
graduate registrants; that is, students
carrying twelve or more credits or
their equivalent in the University
day school are eligible, except second
semester seniors at the discretion of
the Dean of Men.

4. Any entrant who has not passed
twelve credit hours in his preceding
semester, except in the case of first
semester freshmen, is ineligible.

5. No person is eligible to compete
in the meet unless certiﬁed by Mr.
Biddle and Mr. Hagan

6. Each fraternity may enter six
men in each event and compete four.

7. Scoring: Five points, first place;
three points, second place; one point,
third place. Average score of four
contestants in each event determines
winner.

8. ’l‘o be eligible for team trophy,
each fraternity must compete four
men in event entered.

9. No man is eligible to compete
in more than four events. .

10. A list of participants must be
submitted to the office of Theodore
Biddle by ﬁve o’clock Tuesday, April
3, for certiﬁcation. No changes may
be made after that time.

11. The list of events shall be:

1. 200-yard shuttle relay.

. 4-lap relay.

8-lap relay.

Medley relay (3, 2, 1, 4 laps).

Pitt Relay Team Takes V

Panthers made their third western

whole lot wrong with that old adage
of the third time being pzarticularly
fortunate. The Pitt men returned home

time was a slow three minutes, 29.1
seconds, a mark which the Panthers
have betiiered considerably in previous
meets.

Other Panther entries were held
pointless as the University of Mich-
igan led a strong field of teams to
capture the team championship with
an aggregate of 18 3-4 points.

Faculty Bowlers

pions, Phi Kappa, the Faculty bowlers
can now claim the championship of
the University,

Theodore Biddle, assistant to the
dean of men, about took the heart
out of the fraternity champions in the
first game when he rolled a score of
190, Chieﬂy because of this unusually
high game, the Faculty had a lead of
15 pins at the end of the ﬁrst game.

Phi Kappa came back in the sec-
ond, with 581 to take the lead by 70
pins when the Faculty dropped to the
meagre total of 496. The spurt proved
useless because in the final game the
Faculty put on a fast finish, and man-
aged to eke out a ﬁve point margin

The members of the Panther relay
team are Herman Adlersberg, Russell

Denny. During the last three prac-
tice periods, which took place in the
Keystone pool, the team turned in
some of the best times of the season.

Their time in the championship
meet will probably be a few seconds
better than the time recorded in prac-

tice, for each man is a competitive
swimmer. Adlersberg always turns

in his best times when the going gets
tough, and it will be plenty tough in
the meet this weekend.

All of the Big Ten Conference teams
enter strong teams every. year, and
this year is no exception. Some of the
strong Eastern college swimming
teams and a few from the far West
will afford plenty of first class com-

The four members of the Pitt relay
team and Coach Corr will leave by
automobile on Friday morning, arriv-
ing in Columbus late in the afternoon.
They will drive back on Sunday.

Interfraternity Cage Selections

 

Delta Tau Delta Places
Two Players On
First Team

 

By Joseph Barker

Y-Jilliani Schwarzkopf has announced
his selections for the all-fraternity
teams of Leagues “A” and  The
ﬁrst team is a high—scoring outﬁt, its
members having consistently been
among the leading scorers. The team
has Heckler, of Phi Delta'Tlieta, and
l~lartw'g, of Delta Tau Delta, at for-
wards. At the center position Schwarz-
kopf has named Greene, also a Delta
Tau Delta player. The selection will
meet with few protests, for if any
player deserved the honor, Greene
was the man. Probably his skill at
the pivot position had more to do
with Delta Tau Delt.a’s domination of
“A” than any other single factor.
\Vilson, of Phi Gamma Delta, always
a scoring threat, and Leiblich, of Pi
Lambda Phi, who was named as one
of the two outstanding players of
either league, together with Greene,
were chosen as guards

The second team has Beacliler, of
Kappa Sigma, and M,cBride, of Phi
Kappa, forwards; Franks, of Sigma
Chi, at center; Kallaway, of Lambda
Chi Alpha, and Glassford, of Phi Delta
Theta, at guard.

Honorable mention honors go to the
following: Hogan, Delta Tau Delta:
Berman, Phi Epsilon Pi; Sawin, Phi
Gamma Delta; Golanty_ Sigma Alpha
Mu; Dailey, Kappa Sigma; Llewellyn,
Theta Chi; Green, Pi Lambda Phi:

Irish, Duke Players Head All-Opponent
Quintets_Selected By Golden Panthers

 

By Charles A. Ruch

Basketball stars of Notre Dame and
Duquesne dominated the all—opponent
selections made Friday by Pitt’s
Golden Panthers as they tapered off
their drills prior to leaving for the
southern trip. Both the Irish and the
Dukes placed two men on the ﬁrst
team selected by the Golden Cats and
were likewise awarded one place
each on the second ﬁve.

Leading the individuals in vote-
getting was Marty Reiter, famed Du-
quesne guard who is now playing with
the Schugars an independent outﬁt.
The clever little ﬁoorman who led the
Duke attack all season with brilliant
passing was the unanimous choice for
a guard post of the 11 Pitt men turn-
ing in ballots. Oddly enough, it was
the remaining guard position which
caused the only close vote for the
ﬁrst five. Cottom, of Purdue, won

here, by a vote of four to three,
tom also received a ﬁrst team vote at
a forward post,

teams have not been defeated in four years
of competition, which is some kind of a
record.

Coach Pat Corr was elected vice president;
of the Eastern Swimming association. This!

to the Purdue star.

Chairmen Select Committees For

Spring Festival

Dance, Senior Ball

 

Holbrook’s Sports Adair‘
Group Includes 20;
Kleeb Names 16

By Charles B. Holstein

Announcement of committee lists
today through the office of the dean
of men opened the ﬁrst preparations
for the ﬁnal two major dances of the
semester, the Spring Festival SDOITS
dance on May 4, and the Senior Ball,
climax of the year's social schedule,
on May 18.

Including the chairmen, 21 students
have been appointed to the Festival;
dance committee, ﬁve of whom are:
women. and 17 seniors will serve on
the Ball also, including ﬁve women.

John Holbrook E34, recently select-
ed by Student council as chairman of,
the informal dance on the ﬁnal day ol',l
Spring Festival week, and Howard:
Kleeb BA34, whom council appointed
Senior Ball leader, have announced no
definite plans as yet. Last year the
Festival dance took place _at _the
Grotto with two bands eiigaging in a,
“Battle of Music." The Senior Ball.
booked Johnny Johnson and his Hotel ,
Pennsylvania orchestra for a capacity‘-
crowd at the Hotel Schenley. l

’l‘raditioiially, the Spring Festival:
affair is sponsored as an ultra-informal ;
summery sports dance. In the past,§
students have been invited to attend}
in such garb as sleeveless sweaters,’
linen suits, and other warm weather
sports wear_ Low aSS€‘SS1Il€‘.li.S have
prevailed in the past, also_

The Senior Ball annually stands as
the top affair of the last few months
of school. Formal (MESS. e:<l>E‘11S1’\’e5
favors, and nationally _known_oi'cheS-+
ti-as are its usual distinguisliing fac-
tors.

Sub—co1nmittee chairmen and assist-
ants for Spring Festival week have,

inghto Eugene Haverty, E34, the heads
of committees planning the val‘i0uS
events of the week’s activities should
be deﬁnitely selected in the near fu-
ture, and will probably be published in

Musical Farce Attracts Many

Producing a laugh at every turn, the
cast, comedy trio and chorus of the
Cap and Gown club played to packed
houses on both afteriioons last week,
when “The Little Suffragette” was
given its local presentation. The good,
impersonation of girls by some of the}
boys was one of the pleasing tea-1
tures of this year's show; the cun-
ning walk and graceful dancing left
nothing lacking but the voice to make
the illusion complete.

The most exciting feature Of the
whole performance was probably the
suffragette parade, in: which the
inodislily attired “hikers” with ban-
ners and cunning smiles, accompanied
by the ever present male adherents
to the cause, and the tricky sham-
miug of the hen-peeked liusban_d,|
made the audience lean forward In
their seats. Added to this, the comedy
trio flll'lllSlle(l thrillers tlirougliout the
show and pulled off some of the best

musical numbers in the play. I
