PHILADELPHIA-—Pennsylvan-
ians, many befuddled by a crowded

ballot, go to the polls Tuesday in an
attempt to sort out the winners in
the state’s primary election.

Top attraction statewide is the
govemor’s race, nip-and-tuck con-
tests on both tickets that have
stirred little voter chatter—in part
because the abundance of candi-
dates has made it impossible for
anyone to really stand out.

Besides, with a few exceptions,
they’ve all courted the same
politically safe issue—like coming
out against government corruption
or in ‘favor of filling potholes.
Hardly stuff to arouse the citizenry.

There are seven Republicans and
four Democrats seeking their

party’s nod. In addition,

six

Republicans and 14 Democrats are
vying for lieutenant governor. Also
at stake are party nominations for
U.S. Congress, half of the 50 state
Senate seats and 203 state House
seats. V
And the voters get to decide
whether . to change the state
Constitution to elect the attorney
general, who is now appointed by
the governor.

Less than half of Pennsylvania’s
registered voters are expected to
turn out, and that’s if it’s sunny.
More foul weather could cut deeply
into that ﬁgure.

‘ ‘If the weather continues like it is
the turnout is going to drop down a
little bit,” Dick Filling, Republican
state chairman, said yesterday, the
third straight day it has rained in the
state. “We figured it would be

around 42 percent, but if the
weather doesn’t improve it could
drop down as low as 35.”

Democratic state chairman
Dennis Thiemann has predicted the
turnout will range between 30 to 45
percent, depending on the skies
and interest generated by local
races.

The National Weather Service
called for a 90 percent chance of rain
for eastern Pennsylvania on Tues-
day, and a 60 to 80 percent chance in
the western part of the state.
Patchy fog also was predicted and a
ﬂash ﬂood watch was posted in
some areas.

Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8
p.m. A

On the Republican side, the
gubernatorial candidates; in the
order they appear on the ballot, are:

'Crowded' Ballots Await Voters At Polls Today

J. Andrew Watson, a Harrisburg
businessman; Arlen Specter, form-
er district attorney of Philadelphia;
Robert Butera, former House
minority leader; Alvin Joseph
Jacobson, a disabled Air Force
veteran from Adams County; David
Marston, former U.S. attorney for
eastern Pennsylvania; Richard
Thornburgh, former U.S. attorney
for western Pennsylvania; and
Henry Hager, Senate minority
leader.

The Democratic gubernatorial
ticket: Jennifer Lee Wesner, former
mayor of Knox, Pa.; Robert P.
Casey, former state auditor gen-
eral; Peter Flaherty, former mayor
of Pittsburgh; and Lt. Gov. Ernest
P. Kline.

Although both parties opted last
winter for open primaries, Penn-

sylvania’s two Republican U.S.
senators couldn’t resist the chance
to jump in.

Sen. H. John Heinz III, a
westerner, earlier this month threw
his support behind Thomburgh of
Pittsburgh, three days after Sen.
Richard Schweiker, an easterner,
endorsed Philadelphia”s Marston.

Critics claimed Schweiker and
Heinz, who both have expressed
interest in a spot on the national‘
ticket in 1980’, were hoping to put a
man in the mansion from whom they
could call in their I.O.U. ’s two years
hence.

Accroding to state ﬁgures, some
8.3 million Pennsylvanians are
eligible to vote Tuesday, meaning
that only two out of three people of
voting age even bothered to sign up.

SGBlO.K.'s Money For New Pitt Programming Council

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
. Pitt News Staffwriter

The Student Government

Board (SGB) began reviewing and

approving budgets Thursday and

yesterday for standing committees

of student government, including

the budget for the newly organized

Pitt Union Programming Council
(PUPC).

The board last Thursday ap-

proved a three-year ﬁnancial pact,

in which student government will '

fund the council with as much as
$110,000 per year. The chancellor,
through the Office of Student
Activities, will add another $40,000.

During the budget hearing for the
PUPC, a question was raised as to
the scope of the council’s program-
ming power. The question

concerned the ability of some

standing committees to use money

located for the PUPC for

e - ditional programs they may wish
to initiate.

Board member David Hesidence
warned against the awarding of
money to standing committees for
programming that is capable of
being carried out by the PUPC.

“Anything that duplicates what
is in the guidelines (of the PUPC
budget) should not be funded,”

. Hesidence said.

SGB president Josh Baylson said
committees and the council should
work together “within the restric-
tions of the PUPC budget.”

The PUPC budget has been the
only budget approved by the board
to date. -

Other budgets reviewed and
amended Thursday and yesterday
included the Homecoming and
student government, food co-op

‘ committees’ budgets, as well as the

SGBl’s budget.

The budgets of two standing
committees initiated this past year,
the Governmental and Public
Relations (GPR) Committee and the
Commuter Affairs Committee also
were reviewed yesterday.

The board agreed the Commuter
Committee needed more funding
for advertising. Board member
Diane Behers said the additional
funding could be used to purchase
ad space in The Pitt News and other
campus publications. I

It also was moved that additional
money be spent for local lobbying
programs organized by the GPR
committee.

Budget hearings will continue
this week and throughout the spring
session. I

Tuition Hike Not On Agenda As Board
Of Trustees Meet In Johnstown

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

University Trustees are at the
Johnstown campus for their annual
board meeting today, but, unlike in
recent years, Pitt’s budget will not
be discussed to any great length,
and additional tuition hikes for fall
term will not be enacted.

Chancellor Posvar’s report to the
Senate Council last week made clear
Pitt would be unable to act on its
budget until the General Assembly
begins work on the state budget.

“We (the University) cannot act

m/ev4ww«wnv>7p;w .» M w

primaries,” Posvar said last week.
The state legislature- had an-
nounced a four percent increase in
aid to Pitt for next year, but Posvar
said the increase would not be
deﬁnite until the budget is passed
this summer. As a result, any
tuition hike for the fall term may be
delayed until later this summer.
At the Trustees’ winter meeting
last February, the board approved
tuition increases of $3 per
credit-hour for undergraduates ($5
for ' graduate students) for spring

and summer sessions, and $50 per ‘
on the budget until after the

term for undergraduates beginning

this fall ($55 for graduate students).
Last year’s annual meeting, held

at the Greensburg campus, dealt
almost exclusively with Pitt’s
budget and a subsequent tuition
hike of $50 per term.

The Trustees today will most
likely turn their attention to
approving two academic policy
statements: faculty appeals
principles and procedure, and
tenure and appointments policies.

The Academic Affairs Committee
of the board was to review the
statements this morning, in an
unusual _meeting prior to the

afternoon board meeting. The
meeting was to be held on the bus
en route to Johnstown.

The board will also approve an
afﬁliation between the Pittsburgh
Child Guidance Center and the
University and a resolution to

establish the George W. Theiss -

memorial endowment fund. The
fund will be used to make
improvements to Allegheny Ob-
servatory.

A summary of gifts and grants to
the University also will be reported
and discussed. _ V

Potty Hearst
Awaits Prison

By The Associated Press

SAN FRANCISCO—An “ex-
tremely despressed” Patricia
Hearst spent her last hours of
freedom Monday preparing to
return to prison to complete her
seven-year sentence for federal
bank robbery.

U.S. Attorney G. William Hunter
said Miss Hearst, 24, was to
surrender at the minimum-security
prison facility at Pleasanton, 30
miles east of San Francisco.

Miss Hearst, free for 18 months
while unsuccessfully appealing her
conviction, will -have to spend at
least 14 months there before being
eligible for parole next year.

Miss Hearst reportedly spent the
past week at San Simeon, the fabled
coastal estate built by her late
grandfather, newspaper magnate
William Randolph Hearst, 200
miles south of her suburban
Hillsborough home.‘

The Times of San Mateo quoted
unidentiﬁed family sources as
saying Miss Hearst was especially
concerned because all but 15 days of
her previous 14 months in custody
were spent in solitary confinement.

During her previous incarcera-
tion, Miss Hearst spent several
weeks at the campus-like Pleasan-
ton facility, but was transferred to a
San Diego prison after her attorney,
Al Johnson, complained of threats
on her life.

City Was
’F|oodproof'

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Despite a long
history of ﬂooding, most 1977
residents of Johnstown, Pa.,
believed their city was ﬂoodproof
because of a Corps of Engineers
project, a new government study
shows,

The ‘General Accounting Ofﬁce
survey was taken after the city was
inundated with water on July 19,’
1977. Seventy-six persons were
killed, and property damage was
estimated at $330 million.

‘ ‘Eighty percent of the victims we
interviewed told us that, before the
1977 ﬂood, they believed Johns-
town was ﬂoodproof. Most cited
the Corps of Engineers project as
the reason for their belief, ’ ’ said the
study, released Monday:

The Best Choices

Anyone who hasn’t played ostrich for the last two years realizes
the state Government has been beleagured with crisis after crisis.
Last year’s budget battle, which lasted six long months, shows the
massive problems facing the state. The Pennsylvania legislature
shirked their duty to fund state functions, adamantly refusing to
increase taxes to supply needed revenues. Pitt and other state-
supported schools, public employees, who went without pay and
welfare recipients, who received no checks suffered during the
debacle.

Still, Pennsylvania’s fiscal troubles are far solved. Neither our
representatives nor our governor has found enough appropriations
to adequately repair the road system or continue PennDot con-
struction programs. Now the budget office reports another state
operation, liquor stores, must either raise prices or cut expenses.

A drove of Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates
all proclaim they are the messiahs who can save the state. Five
major runners in the Republican primary—Robert Butera, Henry
Hager, David Marston, Arlen Specter and Richard Thorn-

burgh—all claim they are the most qualified to present their party,

in November.

‘ Thornburgh, a former U.S. Attorney from Pittsburgh, appears
the best choice for GOP voters. As a Federal prosecutor he
established a fine record as a dedicated law enforcer who hounded
those who broke the law. Such a dynamic man could shake up

‘ Harrisburg, and bring about change in our decaying system.

In the Democratic primary, Robert P. Casey, Pete Flaherty and
Ernie Kline are the top contenders for the gubernatorial
nomination. These three, a-former Pittsburgh mayor, a past
auditor general and a Lieutenant Governor, have all shown their
ability in local or state government.

Flaherty appears to be the better choice over these other two
Democrats. He turned Pittsburgh around when he came into of-
fice, slashing taxes and cutting the city payroll 25 percent. A man
who can complete such an austere program probably could take af-
firmative action and put the state budget on the best path.

The only way to start Pennslvania moving forward again is to
wade through the flood of competing candidates in theprimary and
select the two best candidates, who seem to be Thornburgh and
Flaherty. A little time and diligence is "all it takes.

Cockroach Brown Carpet for Library

1 was quite surprised to discover
last week that Hillman Library is_
being recarpeted. Immediately,
several questions come to mind:

First, why? There did not seem to
be anything wrong with the
carpeting that was being removed.
Second, how can the cost of such a
needless expenditure be justified?

Pitt’s library system is a disgrace.
Books are missing and not
accounted for, faculty members
keep books needed by students for
three years or more, and for a large
university, Pitt’s general collection
in Hillman Library is woefully
incomplete.

Instead of squandering funds on
such a ridiculous expense, why
didn’t .Hillman Library use the
money now going for new

cockroach-brown carpeting to ex-
pand the library’s embarrassingly
incomplete collection? Last year we
were stuck listening to the bleating
of the administration when the State
Legislature failed to pass Pitt’s
state appropriation.

Now, after all the self-righteous
moralizing about the need for state
funding to allow Pitt to continue to
serve the community, etc., etc.
where has this money gone? It’s
going to replace perfectly good
cockroach-brown carpeting with
new cockroach-brown carpeting. «

Isn’t it about time those who
control the purse strings thought a
little more carefully about the
money they are throwing around?
This large expense in Hillman
Library is going to make a lot of
political hay for some state

legislator the next time Pitt’s
appropriation is held up. And quite
frankly, I’d have to side with him
when I see Pitt spending money so
wastefully.

I think the time has come for a
thorough investigation of the
operation of Hillman Library by an
independent non-partisan commit-
tee made up of both students and
faculty. When the appearance of the
library becomes more important
than the quality of the books it
contains or the service it provides
(both of which are lacking), it is time
for the University community as a
whole to step in, examine the
situation and correct it.

Jet Sales Crucial Point in Carter’s Presidency

BY RONDA HENNING have the technological skills to

match their demands.

The Middle East arms deal,

which proposes to send S0 F-SE
dual-purpose planes to Egypt, 60
F-15 ﬁghters tp Saudi Arabia, and
twenty-five F15’s and 60 F-16’s to
Israel, can be seen as the result of
the wants and needs of the four
countries involved.

Since breaking off relations with,

the Soviet Union, Egypt has been
having trouble maintaning her air
force. Israel believes it is necessary
to stay one step ahead of the,Arab
states militarily. Saudi Arabia
wants to defend herself against her
Soviet-supported leftist neighbors.
But none of these countries

Enter Jimmy Carter on his white
horse. This is the perfect
opportunity to show the world that
his victory over the Senate on the
Panama Canal Treaty wasn’t an
accident.

It’s also about time Israel makes
some concessions in the stalled
Middle East peace talks,
President Carter puts together a
200-plane package that gives
something to everyone and con-
solidates his position, right?

Wrong.’ Congress does not want
to go along with the idea. Israel

SO’

population is, to put it bluntly, not
happy. The Israeli Air Force is

VIEWPOINT

starting to show its age and wants to
rebuild with the best defensive
‘plane on the market—the F-16.
Carter is willing to give Israel 75 of
these -and 15 F-15’s. Israel wishes
to have 250 F-16’s.
That’s only part of the problem.

If no other Middle Eastern country
were getting arms, everything,-

would be fine. But Anwar Sadat has
to be rewarded for going to
Jerusalem and making the first
steps for peace. So Egypt gets 50
F-5E’s an inferior plane—sold
mostly to third world powers—that
can easily be shot out of the sky by
either the F -15 or F -16. Israel, then
surely cannot consider herself
threatened by this part of the
package.

The Saudi Arabian proposal is
Israel’s chief concern. Saudi Arabia
is underpopulated and overendow-
ed with the lifeblood of America:
oil. Since the Saudi's are
surrounded by leftist neighbors, it‘s
only natural to ask their main oil
customer for help. So President
Carter decides to sell Saudi Arabia
60 F-15's, more than Israel’s total

ﬂeet of F15’s. To add to Israel's
worries, the range of this jet enables

Saudi Arabia to attack Israel from
within Saudi borders, something
Israel refuses to take lightly.

The Carter Administra Lion claims
to have concessions from the
Saudis guaranteeing that the planes
will only be used for defense, and
will not be kept at bases near the
Israeli border. As a further
guarantee, only Saudi pilots will be
trained to fly them.

If the U.S. package falls through,
Saudi Arabia has a contingency plan
ready. They have been negotiating

with France, to buy a larger number

of Mirage jet ﬁghters. Supporters of
the arms deal are quick to point out
that it is better for the Saudis to
have access to a limited number of
American planes instead of an
unlimited number from someplace
else.

Israel sees the arms deal as a sign
that its favored position in
American foreign policy is fading in
the wake of the threats of OPEC
price hikes and oil embargoes.
Even with the‘Alaskan pipeline, it is
still cheaper to get oil for the
Eastern Seaboard States from the
Middle East. The Arab states
consider the deal a good-faith
symbol of the thaw in cold
American-Arab relations.

And what does the United States
get for being the friendly neighbor-
hood arms dealer? For one thing,

President Carter can show the rest ‘
of the world that no Congress is
going to quash all of his programs.

1

For another, both sides in thgam
peace talks must begin talking 3}’

again. Israel might have to start
making concessions with the
implicit threat of further arms sales
hanging over her head.

There’s one more reason Carter
needs the package. Unemployment
has just been brought under
control. Without orders for aircraft,
the aerospace corporations may
have to begin massive layoffs,
which‘ eventually leads to higher
unemployment. This damages
Carter’s popularity which has been
declining steadily, and
Congressional election year that
could hurt Democratic candidates.

Carter then becomes less popular
on Capitol Hill than he is now,
seriously hurting his chances for
re-election. The first two years of
the Carter Administration have
hardly been an unqualified success,
and things must be reversed by
1980. '

Carter is bound to get burned
every once in a while when playing
with explosive issues such as the
Panama Canal. energy and the coal
strike. The President has had his
fingers burned too many times
already, and the arms deal match is
getting dangerously close.

’ Fonda, Voight ‘Come Home’
In Sensitive Vietnam Tale

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer
Coming Home
Directed by Hal Ashby

“Coming Home” is the first
serious attempt to deal with the
horrors of, the Vietnam War as
they struck American society. It is
a decent, sensitive film, but it
offers a plot which is not original,
just re-applied to a new situation.

“Coming Home” is set in
Southern California in 1968. Jane
Fonda portrays Sally Hyde, the
wife of a marine captain (Bruce
Dern) sent to Vietnam. Hyde’s
departure changes everything in
their relationship, changes which
are as predictable as the day’s
weather.

A first look at the Hydes reveals
an average American couple.
Hyde, a captain, is in rather good
position in the military, so they live
comfortably in an apartment at the
military base. Hyde doesn’t want
his wife to work and Sally seems
happy as a devoted housewife.

All that changes. Hyde leaves,
and Sally gets a beachfront
apartment, a sportscar, and begins
volunteer work at the military
hospital where dozens of wounded

soldiers arrive each week from
Vietnam.

As the ﬁlm progresses, sym-
pathy for Hyde and the impression
that ‘he is a proud and sensitive
soldier vanishes while empathy for
sally builds.

Sally’s work at the hospital
brings her in contact with Luke
Martin (Jon Voight) who is crippled
from the war.

Fonda and Voight create their
roles so that you are almost
compelled to sympathize with
them.

Sally changes, becoming aware
and concerned with the war and its
effect on peoples’ lives as she turns
politically active. She appears
motivated and sincere, evolving
into her own person while
separated from her husband.

Inviting Luke to her home for
dinner--his first time outside of that
depressing hospital in months--is a
praiseworthy act, but it precedes
on obvious outcome.

Voight combines traces of both a
sensitive and agressive personality
making Luke a determined, but far
from obnoxious person. He
ﬁnds his own ways to protest the
war he fought in. In one scene he is
lecturing to high school students on

the alternatives of going to war,
He paints the ugly realities of
Vietnam for those who are still
looking at the war in a sort of
romantic way—-a chance to be
heroes.

Dem’s acting is also built upon
strength. His dutiful acceptance of
a war that is a total failure and his
explosive reaction to Sally and Luke
make him villainous. It is an ironic
blend that the audience must
accept, but one that is part of a
distorted American society where
everything was upside down.

Director Hal Ashby depended
almost totally on the three
individuals’ lives to create the
war-era mood. Only on brief
occasions does the audience see
anti-war protests. Reports from
the war or slices of the politics
behind it are almost non-existent. .

The time setting-1968-was an
explosive year with severe military
setbacks, political assassinations, a
presidential election and the
snowballing protest movement.
Most of those activities are either
ignored or implied, as “Coming
Home” works through in-
dividuals—not groups.

There must be dozens of ﬁlms
with plots involving married

Jane Fonda, now starring in “Coming Home,” a film about Vietnam.

persons with other love affairs, but
“Coming Home” adds a dynamic
force which turns that simple story
line into a microview of how

Vietnam hit American society.

Marley Brings Jamaica Home in N ew Album

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Bob Marley & The Wailers
Kaya
Island Records

Reggae king Bob Marley brings
Jamaica home in his latest work,
“Kaya.” Marley’s supporting
band, the Wailers, has changed
over the years. The only originals
remaining are the two talented
Barrett brothers, Carlton and
“Familyman.” But the music is
still ﬁne and Marley’s talent shines
through.

“Kaya” is cheerful, dealing with
everyday joys of life, as can be seen
in the titles of songs like “Easy
Skanking,” “Kaya,” “Sun is
Shining,” and “Is this Love.”
Marley sings out carefree melodies
that create their mood and deliver
their message.

The composition of Marley’s
music is simple and well organized
—Drummer Carlton Barrett pro-
vides the strong reggae beat and
rhythm, while “Familyman” keeps
pace on the bass; Marley’s rhythm
guitar solidifies each musical
element into a whole; Julian

Marvin is steady at lead guitar,
while Tyrone Downie’s keyboards
soften and enrich the songs.

Horns are used sparingly, the
best showings being Vin Gordon’s
rich sax in “Easy Skanking” and
the crisp trumpet work of Glen
DaCosta and David Madden in
“Misty Morning” and “Running
Away.”

Even though reggae is not often
thought of as “commentary”
music, Marley does show a serious
side in his work. In his earlier days
he often showed a rebellious,
almost militant spirit in songs such

as “Slave Driver” and “Get Up,
Stand Up.”

Although still present in
“Kaya,” Marley is less severe in
his commentary now. It seems
more as if he is giving advice rather
than making a formal statement. In
“Crisis,” Marley advises, “No
matter what the crisis is, give Jah
all the thanks and praises.”

Marley’s words in “Running
Away” are hard to dispute: “You
running and you running,” he
sings, “but you can’t run away
from yourself.”

Marley’s words are simple in

order to ﬁt the reggae style. Even
so, he shows a certain wisdom and
sophistication in his music, a
common-sense character in his
lyrics. But no matter how listeners
interpret the songs, they will ﬁnd
them very pleasing to listen to.

In short, “Kaya” is very simple
and straightforward, yet very
entertaining, probably Marley’s
best work. If this album is any
indication, Marley’s upcoming
concert in Pittsburgh should be
something to look forward to.

Dave McDonald’s cheering section was
not disappointed.

As the senior distance specialist ran lap
after lap in the Pitt Invitational 10,000-meter
ﬁnal, a small group of supporters kept up a
loud and constant stream of enthusiastic
chatter. McDonald was out to qualify for the
NCAA championships in this event, after
doing so in the 5,000-meter run hours
before.

- McDonald finished third in the 10,000-
meter. which featured a breathtaking
gunlap battle between Cleveland State’s
Marc Hunter and Penn State’ s John Zeigler.

but only by eight seconds and ﬁnished

His time of 29:40 not only qualified him for.

the NCAA meet, but was a new team record
as well.

“I had to run my own race,” McDonald
said. “I couldn't keep up with the others
(Hunter and Zeigler) because I was afraid I
might burn myself out.”

McDonald will have to choose between
entering the five- or 10- kilometer
competition at the Nationals since running
both races would involve too much of a
physical strain.

While McDonald was satisﬁed with his
own performance Friday night, his
teammate, high jumper Dan Goodyear, was
not. Goodyear won the event with a leap of
6-11, but near-misses at 7-1‘/4 (good
enough to qualify for Nationals) came as a
disappointment.

The high jump competition itself started
out in bizarre fashion when Goodyear
emerged as the only jumper out of a ﬁeld of
16 to clear the starting height of 6-5. The
Panther athlete was then allowed to
continue jumping until his seven-foot-plus
misses, after which the rest of the ﬁeld
started over again to battle for the remaining
places.

Pitt's Mike Sapienza also suffered a
near-miss in the decathelon, a new event in
the Invitational. Sapienza had to defeat

Bob Crow placed fourth.

In the 5000-meter run, Mel Boyd joined
McDonald in qualifying for Nationals. .
His 14:08.6 clocking was fast enough for
third place behind Penn State’s Bob Snyder
and . Allegheny Community College Irish
ace, Malcolm East.

The mile relay team of Bud Cooper, Greg
Conover, Keith Leckenby and Larry Shippen
also ﬁnished third. The Panther foursome
ran a 3:1S.9, one of the quartet’s better
times this year. Purdue, winnner of the ﬁrst
heat, edged out the hometown favorites, for
second place.

Two host-team members placed fourth in
ﬁeld events—Keith Taylor (triple jump) and
Gene Roach (pole vault). Roach upped his
school record by one half-inch with a vault of

trials, Herrmann won his heat with a time of
1:52.0 after trailing most of the race. .

Aided by six victories out of 21 events,
plus numerous second- and third-place
ﬁnishes, Penn State won the team title.

0 Johnny Majors may be many things, but one
§thing he is not is dumb. The Tennessee coach was in
Pittsburgh the other day, and found time to get
together with Ed Ifft, Pat Cupelli, Bill Baierl, John
Conomikes and Bob Casey, influential members of
both the community and the Golden Panthers.
Simply by his association with people of this stature,
Majors makes certain that his name is not forgotten
by the local media, Pittsburgh residents or high
school football players. One day, a local prospect
might have trouble deciding whether to attend Ten-
V nessee or Michigan, and aname like Majors is a lot
easier to remember and spell than Schembechler.

0 With the signing of Sam Ellis, a 6-6 shooting

«forward from Middle Georgia College, coach Tim

Grgurich’s recruiting chores for next season are over.
According to Grgurich, Ellis “was the key to our
recruiting season,” and is a player “in the mold of
Larry Harris and Billy Knight.” There’s nothing like
having to start a major college career under pressure.

0 Until the Pirates increase their run production
(even if their victory total does not suffer), at-
tendance will continue to decline.

0 The Senior Bowl, the annual all-star game in
Mobile, Ala., continues to be the top showcase for
college players seeking pro careers. Of the 65 players
invited to last January’s contest (Rea Schuessler is in
charge of recruiting players), 61 were drafted by NFL
teams, 50 in the ﬁrst six rounds.

0 NFL owners are to be commended for not
allowing the free agent system to destroy football, as
it threatens to do to baseball, basketball and hockey.

  There Is No Major Change in the Way lohnn y Operates  

There were 125 players who became free agents this
year, but only six received offers from new teams,
which signals beginning of competition for their ser-
vices. . Ed Garvey, executive director of the NFL
Players’ Association, contends the major reasons for
the failure of free agency in the NFL are that many
teams will not bid on free agents, and that many
players are asking for too much in raises. The com-
pensation clause (stating that a team that signs a free

 

agent must compensate the player’s former team with
draft choices based on the new salary) is also a cure
for St_einbrenner’s Syndrome. The six players who
received offers were all signed by their original
teams.

0 Look for Fitz Dixon, owner of the Philadelphia
76ers, to unload George McGinnis, Lloyd Free and
possibly Henry Bibby. A one-on-one team never has
won the NBA title, and Dixon desperately wants a
championship for the Sixers. Philadelphia showed
signs of playing as a team in sweeping the quarter-
final series with the New York Knicks, but reverted
to form against the Washington Bullets. The Sixers

contests to 16. The inaugural Meadowlands Bowl
will be held this season in Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford, N.J., and the Pineapple Bowl will begin
in 1979 and will be played in Hawaii.

0Joe Gilliam, whose latest adventure finds him
trying out for the Dallas Cowboys, has about as
much chance to make that team as Frank Taveras has
of winning a Golden Glove.

0 Notre Dame will find it almost impossible to
defend its national championship, despite an ex-
cellent recruiting year. The 1978 Irish schedule in-
cludes Missouri, Michigan, Pitt, Tennessee and
Southern California.

0 The only way Penn State will be able to live up to
its advance billing and win the national champion-
ship is to end the season with less, losses than any
other big-time football school, then tack on a victory
in a major bowl. Few teams are able to finish in the
top position after much pre-season publicity, and the
Nittany Lions will not be one of them.

Felder Sees Snub in NFL Draft As

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

One man not happy with last week’s NFL draft
was Pitt’s LeRoy Felder. Felder, expected to go in
the later rounds, wasn’t drafted at all.

“It’s a slap in the face, that’s what it is,” said
Felder, a mainstay in the Pitt defensive backfield for
three years. “All they’re trying to tell you is that you
aren’t good enough to play for them.”

Felder said he had an idea he wasn’t going to be
drafted when the Steelers, Baltimore Colts and Green
Bay Packers _called him while the draft was in
progress, asking whether he wanted to sign as a free
agent.

Felder added he “would more than likely” report
to one of those three teams’ training camps this
summer, although it will be “very unlikely” he will
try out with the Steelers, who made a‘ defensive back
(Ron Johnson from Eastern Michigan) their first-

' round selection. '

“I don’t think they’re going to need me,” the

Felder, who will graduate in June, said he was “
bit surprised” that teammate Randy Reutershan,
drafted in the sixth round by the Steelers, Went as
high as he did.

At one time, Felder was considered a better pro
prospect than Reutershan.

Scouting being an all-year business, the pros are,
no doubt, already thinking about next spring’s player
lottery. Wide receiver Gordon Jones, middle guard
Dave Logan, linebacker Al Chesley, tight end Steve
Gaustad and offensive lineman Matt Carroll are Pitt
players sure to get long, hard looks by the pros this
fall._ Tony Dorsett’s employer, the Dallas Cowboys,
have already expressed more than a mild interest in
Jones. Cowboy director of player personnel Gil

" Brandt, in attendance at one of the Pitt games last

fall, didn’t have his binoculars focused on number 24
all afternoon for nothing.

“He could be the best football player in the coun-
try right now, pro or college,” Brandt said at the

Slap in the Face

Better than Dorsett, he was asked?
“That’s kind of hard to say, but he could be, he
could very well be.”

Next to Jones, Logan probably has the best chance
of going in the early rounds next spring. The consen-
sus among pro scouts is that the 6-2, 240 pound
lineman would fit in nicely at either defensive tackle
or nose guard on a team that uses the increasingly
popular three-four defense.

Whether his brush with the law last spring will hin-
der his chances, Chesley has the quickness, outstan-
ding lateral movement, and speed the pros like, as
well as a love for contact.

Gaustad reminds people of his predecessor and
current Cincinnati Bengal Jim Cobett. Like Corbett,
Gaustad has the hands, downfield speed and
blocking ability the pros like.

Carroll, with the necessary speed and agility to get
outside quickly, would seem to be the pros’-idea of

Baltimore native said.
