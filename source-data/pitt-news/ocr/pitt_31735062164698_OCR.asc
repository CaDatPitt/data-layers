Fund Drive Begun by University

Lack of Money Is  
WPGH’s Problem

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

“Given half the chance,
radio station WPGH could
really be good,” commented
program director, Bob Kap-
Ian.

People don’t listen be-
cause WPGH does not have
the money for better equip-
ment. WPGH does not have
the money because adver-
tisers do not advertise. Advertis-
ers do not advertize on stations
which have poor reception and
limited range.

'When University students dem-
onstrated in Montgomery, Ala-
bama, WPGH served as the com-
munication center for local news
media and the administration.
“This cost WPGH approximately
$60 and minus 100 hours of sleep
for Harvey Weisman, Art Feller,
Stu Schwartzstein, and the en-
gineers.

At the height of the confusion
it was reported that the local ra-
dio stations and/ or the Universi-
ty were going to cover the cost
of these phone calls. So far no
such mysterious benefactor has
appeared, leaving WPGH with a
static bank account.

These internal money problems
prevent WPGH from improving
its range and reception. The sta-
tion presently broadcasts AM on
a carrier current (via the elec-
trical wires in the dorms and
towers.)

According to Kaplan, the sta-
tion will not be able to broadcast
through the air, because of the
instability of the station. “We
are in constant ﬂux because the
station has never been able to
build a solid base and broadcast
technically well.”

Kaplan partially attributed the
lack of listeners to “the low in-

centive of our good disc jockeys.

and engineers, because of the
lack of funds for good equip-
ment.”

 

SIG NORR, who assumes the role
of General Manager‘ of WPGH in
the fall, watches as disc jockey
George Nachdigal announces a
record on his show.

Litchfield Speaks in Mt. Lebanon 

Alumni Question

Litchfield on Money

By'KAREN TOKAR
Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield, ad-
dressing an alumni meeting for the Annual
Giving Fund Campaign, Wednesday in Mt.
Lebanon, admitted that “I’ve run you com-

pletely out of money,” the future depends

“either on realizing a new momentum or
recognizing that we don’t have it.”

Addressing 75 of the
expected 300 alumni,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld ex-'
plained that ten years ago
the expansion program
was conceived with t h e
idea that the University
would be backed by en-
dowments, but for the
last ﬁve years the giving’ ‘
has lagged behind the
University’s development.
Furthermore the State has not given enough for
the University to realize its full potential.

He further emphasized that the University’s ex-
pansion program carmot continue unless there is

  

Dr. Litchﬁeld

’a’ widespread feeling that .a “great” Univelfsity iS _

needed, for there is no reason in constructing
something the community does not want.

The Chancellor stressed that he wanted a clear,

mandate. from the community; if the program is
too much or too little, the community should tell
him. _

He admitted that in the past years the ad-
ministration has not been able to convey to the
alumni how much their participation and support

was -and is now needed.

Most alumni were dubious about giving their
support to a school that “was breeding another
Castro — that beatnik bum Stern.” Chancellor
Litchﬁeld replied that he found Erie Stern, the
president of Student Government, very coopera-

tive and that to judge someone on appearance
was very immature. He quoted Stern as saying

that the students are not asked to do enough for
the Fund Giving campaign.
‘(Continued on Page 8)

Drive Emphasizes ,
General Operations

The University will officially launch the

personal solicitation phase of the Annual-

Giving Fund Campaign, Sunday. This phase
is aimed at the “largest group’ of alumni,

friends, corporations, and foundations that f'_
have even been approached at one time for ,2’
support,” according to a statement issued 

by the University.

The campaign was announced by General 

Chairman Philip K. Herr at a press luncheon

Thursday. The campaign had already begun un- 

officially the evening before when Chancellor Ed-

ward H. Litchfield addressed 75 of an expected I

300 alumni at a Fund Campaign meeting in Mt.
Lebanon. I
The Chancellor said at the luncheon that it is

important that the University get as many peo- I F
ple interested,as possible in the general welfare I .‘
of the University “and not in a purely ﬁnancial . '

way.” He went on to say that both the community

college and the university are necessary, but he 
-felt that the university is particularly needed be-eh 

‘cause~~-it--— provides for «the. education of. 

and professional students.

At the same luncheon Chancellor Litchﬁeld; ;.‘:.'ft:5-

a co-chairman of the’ campaign released a report _ ‘if;
to the community on the University’s progress in 

the last decade. “By all the measurable indexes)’, 
the report concluded,” the University’s  

in the past ten years has been signiﬁcant.”

The University’s history before Chancellor. 

Litchﬁeld assumed office in 1955 was termed “long 
and distinguished.” The report went on to say,~ T‘

however, that the University at that time lacked 

much in terms of all-around faculty ability, pro-. 

gram standards (particularly at the graduate lev-
el), and physical plan .”

The fund campaign will begin with what is
believed by the University to be “the ﬁrst effort

by a college or university to reach a major portion I I‘

television.” '

Midday address at noon in the Student

Born in Sacramento California, in 1912, Broth.
er Antoninus served as a conscientious objector
during World War II and afterwards became
identiﬁed with the anarcho-paciﬁst group around
the poet, Kenneth Rexroth.

He published his ﬁrst book, The Residual Years,
in 1948, and entered the Dominican Order in 1951.
Since then he has written The Crooked Lines of
God and The Hazards of Holiness.

Brother Antoninus’s poetry is based on a pre-
occupation with humanity and original sin. He

uses his native West to modernize Bible episodes —

and_ evidences a blend of his lay and monastic
lives. '

(The following is a reply from
Thomas J. Foerster, member of
the Pennsylvania House of Rep-
resentatives, to a column by Don-

ing the University a state school.)

“It is my opinion that
Pittsburgh is in dire need
of a low cost public univers-
ity. The State Board of Edu-
cation in a recent news re-
lease, has also stated that Pitts-
burgh should be the site of a
new State University. Chancellor
Litchﬁeld has stated that the Uni-
versity should serve the needs of
the region. I feel the needs of
the region could be best served
if Pitt would agree to become a
State affiilated university.

Individual 6}’ Group Tutoring

University students in
need of tutoring may now
obtain this service at no
charge from Phi Eta, Sigma,
national h o n o r ar y fratern-
ity.

Interested students should ﬁll
out cards provided in the Tow-
ers Lobby or at the Student
Union Desk. The purpose of these
cards is to determine in what
subjects tutors are needed.

Tutoring for basic natural sci-
ence courses will be offered in
group sessions. Individual tutoring
in other undergraduate courses
will be available for men only.
Women who wish to be tutored
individually should contact the
Associated Women Students,
which is beginning a tutoring
program.

All tutors have high academic
records and are qualiﬁed to tutor

 their subjects. A 3.5 QPA is

required for Phi Eta Sigma mem-
bership. '

The fraternity is also planning
to distribute to all male fresh-
men, including 800 men on re-
gional campuses, a pamphlet con-
taining hints on how to study.
As an additional service the fra-
ternity will send a speaker to
each of the campuses to aid the
new students in learning more
effective study habits.

— A column has appeared both in this is-

 Life is not exactly a bed of roses in the
 _ Army, the author relates. The stories he
 .1 tells are amusing, but they also quite sad.
It is clear that a trained mind is being
wasted unfortunately, this tragedy is two-

fold.

_ ._ Today there are few areas in which
 there is not a tremendous proliferation of
material being written and published. Col-
lege graduates are finding it-increasingly

much in that field and is not particularly
sought for by companies. In the Army as
a draftee, a graduate is given little choice.
He has rarely, if ever, a chance to see any-
thing about his area of study. It isn’t that
the Army is anti-intellectual, it’s just that
the private is assigned where there is a

It is first amazing that

It is not being argued that graduates
should be given preferential treatmentin
the Army or even excluded altogether from
military service. What should happen is
that these college draftees should be given
jobs in the Army commensurate with their
training, not assigned where a warm body
and a strong back is needed. It is an Amer-
ican tragedy when our country has placed
so much faith in our generation’s abilities
only to have it shamefully wasted by a
myopic and -dated system. '

Basic Training

 

By Jim O’ Brien

t This is the last of a two part series by former Pitt -News
sports editor Jim O’Brien about his experience with basic
training. O’Brien graduated from the University in 1964 and
is now a. private first class in the United States Army.)

A common bond of humor was the one luxury that
Army permitted us during basic combat training, probably
because it was impossible to take away, and indeed it was
the only safety valve that made Army life at all endurable.

The source of most of my humor were my comrades of
the college caste.

My favorite failure among the lot was
Jack O’Connor, a big, apple-cheeked ham
any mother would swear was the picture
of good health. Unfortunately for Jack,
there. weren’t any others among the NCO
ranks. '

JACK WAS A GRADUATE of the
drama school at St. Ambrose College in
Davenport, Iowa, an excellent, if some-
what unique, rehearsal for his ultimate
job as a social worker in a slum section of
Chicago prior to his induction at the ripe old age of 24.

 

Jim O’Brien

He was a fair-haried boy from Chicago who believed in
God, Motherhood and American Way of Life. He was not
particularly enthralled with the idea of personally preserv-
ing the latter, however.

. He emerged from the sort of home that probably had
a framed sampler on the dining room wall: The Family That
Prays Together Stays Together.

His mother was a school teacher, his father was a
postal worker, his sister was a postulate in a nunnery, and
Jack was a struggling soldi'er-in-errant. And they were all
separated. . I

O’CONNOR wAs GOOD - NATURED, generous and .

likeable. In three days none of the sergeants could stand
him. He sent shudders of annoyance scampering up their
spines. " .

His woes began during the first mail call. Sgt. Burt
Hart stopped short while pitching out the day’s mail.

“Jack O’Connor!” said Sgt. Hart, scrutinizing the name
of the addressee on one letter. “Jack O’Connor? I thought
your name was John.”

O’Connor flashed a smile of sweet reasonableness, his
brown eyes swimming in sincerity. “They’re both the same,
Sergeant,” said Jack, j erkily. “Jack and John.”

“Well, I'll be damned,’ said Sgt. Hart, a streak of red
revelation creasing his brow. “They're both the same, huh?”

“YES, SERGEANT. You know how they called John.

F. Kennedy, Jack Kennedy.”

“So you think you’re as good as The President, young
dud?”

“Of course not, Sergeant,” whimpered Jack in meek
apology, retreating sheepishly.

This was the sort of martyrdom Jack O’Connor, ex-
altar boy, ex-choir boy, suffered for eight weeks before the
red, resentful, criticizing faces of sergeants. Sergeants,
sergeants, everywhere. ‘

Jack was buffaloed and bossed to the extent that he ,

assumed a practically Clhinese acquiescence in resistance.
You needed a strong constitution to stick to your splendor
in the face of these damnation chats. But Jack soon learned
to thrive on hazing.

“I don’t think I could stand up under ﬂattery,” he
sighed one day.

0’CONNOR’S AMOROUS, easily-offended eyes, and
and warm, easily coloring face assumed a different look, one
of near Attilan savagery, however, when he was engaged in
bayonet training. ,

“What’s the spirit of the bayonet fighter?” cried out
Sgt. Hart. '

“Kill, kill, kill, arrrrhhhhh!” shouted back Jack O’Con-
nor, with the impact of a half dozen John Waynes. 0’Conner
was easily the greatest growler in all of Fort’ Knox.

He confessedthat he was merely practicing his method
acting, and said he wouldn’t have the heart to actually
strike anyone with his bayonet. I - -

Pitchers Dave Blyshak,
Lee Brueckel, Paul Helsel,
and Don Stock continue to
dominate the baseball sea-
son, compiling three shut-
outs against Indiana State
and Wayne State this week-
end.

These four pitchers have pitch-
ed seven shutouts in the team’s
nine consecutive wins without a
loss. The nine wins equals last
season's total winning record,
and the season is only half over.

Helsel and Stock split the
chores, allowing one hit each in
.a 4-0 win over Indiana State last
Thursday.

Wayne State lost 2-0, 2-0 in a
doubleheader here Saturday as
Blyshak and Brueckel gave three
and two hits, respectively. The
“B” boys have now won three
consecutive doubleheaders, and
the pitching staff has allowed
only 18 hits and three runs. in

By RON SHEARERS .
“'I'here’s safety in num-
bers”, and Penn State and
West Virginia put the say-
ing to good use as they fin-
ished lst and 2nd, ‘respec-
tively, in the ﬁrst annual
“Big Four” track and field
meet at Mountaineer Field.
Both teams used their superior
depth, scoring 671/2 and 53 points,
respectively. The track team cap-
tured third place with 41 points,

by and Syracuse ﬁnished last with

211/2 points.

“They have too many bodies to
work with,” said coach Rees. The
Nittany Lions ﬁelded a squad
nearly twice as large as Syracuse

and Luddy Hayden, were each
entered ‘in six events. All three
were on the 440-yard relay team
which was nipped by West Vir-
ginia.

Crout also won the 440-yard
dash, and ﬁnished second in the
220 behind DelVecchio, who also
won the 100—yard dash. Hayden
took .a second place in the broad
jump, and won the 120-yard high
hurdles.

The trackmen were far oﬁ the

lead as they only scored only,

eight of a possible 77 points in
the aﬁeld events. Marc Pollack
copped third place in the discus,
and Jim LaValley surprisingly
took a second place in the high
jump _with a career high of six
feet four inches. He lost to Mau-

rice Moon of West Virginia be-
cause he had more misses.

They did not score in the jave-
lin, pole vault, shot put, or the
triple jump. The deﬁcit ‘was too
much for the runners to make up.

Bill DelVecchio gave the best
performance by a runner. He tied
the school record with a time of
9.6 seconds in winning the 100-
yard dash, and set a Mountaineer
Field record by running the 220-
yard dash in 21.6 seconds.

He also r.an the fastest quarter-
mile in the stadium’s history by
doing 46.9 while anchoring the
mile relay team. He turned an
eightyard deﬁcit into a three
yard lead in running the third
leg of the 440-yard relay team.

and Pitt, .and had only one dou-
ble winner. Sophomore Lennart
Hedmark took the javelin and
the triple jump events. Penn
State and West Virginia each
took six ﬁrst places, while Pitt
won four and Syracuse one.
The tracksters problem was the
juggling of competitors so as to
get the maximum results from
their small (16 man) squad. Three
