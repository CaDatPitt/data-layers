64/74Ubus routeshutclown
prompts safety concerns

:St w r'k

 

Pitt students living in Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill are angered by the closing of bus
line routes 64U and 74U.

Due to a new contract between Pitt and
Pittsburgh Port Authority Transit (PAT), bus
routes 64U and 74U, which were created
especially for students living in the Shadyside
and Squirrel Hill areas, will no longer be part
of PAT ’s regular bus schedule.

Carena Winters, a graduate student liv-
ing in Squirrel Hill, is concerned about safety
because she now must walk home ﬁve
blocks, instead of being dropped otf in front
of her apartment

“In about a month, it is going to be dark
when I get off the bus. [Pitt administrators]
are supposed to be wonied about safety, but
they don’t care that they are putting us in a
position where we aren’t safe,” she said _

Bob Harkins, director of Padang and
Transportation, admits that it was his depart-
ment’s decision to discontinue the routes. Still
he insists that safety is one of the departrnent’s
top concerns.

“Yes, we are concerned with safety. For
students ﬂrat now have to walk, naturally
they’re going to be pissed at Harkins. But, I
am spending your money, so I have to make
decisions in the best interest of the entire stu-
dent body,” said Harkins.

All students enrolled at the University
pay a $30 per semester transportation and
security fee. Pitt uses this fee to, among other
ﬂrings, pay PAT a ﬂat rate to provide trans-
portation to and from Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill.

In April 1993, Pitt started a shuttle ser-
vice to both Shadyside and Squirrel Hill,
which are popular sites for students choosing
to live outside of Oakland Then in May
1995, Pitt worked out an agreement to pay
PATaﬂatratetotakeoVerallst11denttrans—
portation to and from Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill. Under the original contract, PAT created
two new routes, 64U and 74U, which would
cater primarily to the needs of Pitt students.

However, under the new contract, which
went into effect in August, Pitt allowed both

Nestled within the corridors of the sixth
ﬂoor of the building for Pitt’s School of
Information Science is the office of a man
who, for nearly 50 years, has made it his
life’s work to educate others on and to
advance the ﬁeld of library science.

Dr. E.J. Josey, professor emeritus of the
newly renamed Department of Library and
Information Science recently had another
honor bestowed upon him — being named
to the American Library Association’s 50th
Anniversary Honor Roll. The American
Library Association is the organization that
oversees all the libraries in the country.

Josey, along with the school’s dean, Dr.
Toni Carbo, were included on the list of
60,000 ALA members recognized for their

efforts in f1md- raising and legislative poli— V

cy for the nation’s l16,0()0—p1us libraries.

 

For Josey, this recognition is only one
in a long list of professional achievements.
Josey served the New York State Education
Department in its Division of Library
Development from 1966 until coming to
Pitt in 1986. He also worked for the
libraries at Delaware State College,
Savannah (Ga.) State College, and at
Columbia University. In addition, Josey
was on the staffs of the Free Library of
Philadelphia and the New York Public
Library. He was also voted president of the
ALAin 1984. _ -

He described his presidency as “an
honor I’ll never forget.”

The contributions Josey has made to
Pitt in the past include an increase in the
retention and recruitment of minority stu-
dents within the University and a revival of
the Minority Concerns Council.

spent working with AFL-CIO

Ingrid

I spent three weeks in June experienc-
ing things I had never done before as part of
a new AFL-CIO internship program for
college students: Union Summer. After
spending that time helping non-unionized
workers in Detroit coordinate with existing
unions in the area, my eyes have been
opened to new concerns in the American
system, both for and against union organiz-
mg.

It was an incredible experience for me.
I didn’t know much about current unions
and what they are doing these days. The
only opinions I could form were based on
the “American Workers in the 20th
Century” class at Pitt and what people told
me about their individual opinions. I felt

‘Union Surmner would give me the person-

al experience to make an informed opinion
of organized labor by myself.

We stayed at the University of Detroit
at Mercy, in the heart of Detroit There were
27 of us from all over the U.S., one guy
ﬁom Canada, and one ﬁom Germany. Our
ages varied from 18 and just graduating
ﬁom high school to 26 and going to grad
school. There were three people from
Pittsburgh, so I bonded with them. Man, I

 

tell you, it was a motley crew — we had

“ll? democrats, socialists, anarchists, and even a

republican.

The ﬁrst two—and-a-half days of our
internship were ﬁlled with lectures about
steps to organizing sweatshops on the U.S.-
Mexican border, community organizations,
labor law, and history. It was a little too
intense for us because we didn’t get many:
breaks, and we were stuck in the same.
room for as long as eight hours in a row. But
it was good time to bond, with looks of
agony at each other from across the u-
shaped table.

The first local we went to was
International Unon of Operating Engineers '
local 547 (IUOE). For the ﬁrst week, our ..
group was split into several smaller groups 3 ‘
of about eight or nine kids who would work
with a dilferent union every day.

My ﬁrst day, I worked with the“ 1

Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters =
(MRCC). We leaﬂetted in ﬁont of Cracker
Barrel restaurants, which were building
with non-union labor. Since this was the‘

ﬁrst time I had actually done something that ' '*

peoplein authority could easily see and be
upset by, I was nervous. We got kicked out
of the front of the restaurant almost‘ imme-
diately and went to catch people going in at

SEAC plans host of protests

The Student Environmental Action Coalition
(SEAC) will be holding its next meeting in the middle of
the street

But it won’t be just any street, because only the most
talked about street in Oakland will be suitable. SEAC
will meet on Bigelow Boulevard this Sunday in support
of its controversial Sept 15 closing.

“We’re going to have some hand in what’s going on
with Bigelow Boulevard, but we’re not sure to what
extent,” said SEAC member Mike Kaizer.

Also discussed at the organization’s meeting this

past Sunday was the possibility of staging a sit—in on the
street the night it is scheduled to re—open in October.
Members at last Sunday’s meeting felt that additional
support could easily be generated ﬁom other students on
campus.
Group leaders also say they’ll be on hand to protest
if Bill Clinton re-schedules his campaign trip to
Pittsburgh. The basis for their protest centers around a
hazardous waste incinerator located in East Liverpool,
Ohio. According to SEAC members, Waste
Technologies Industries (WTI) is the largest such incin-
erator in the world, and it is operating without a permit

“Four years ago, Bill Clinton and Al Gore pointed
at W'I'I and said they’d shut it down,” said SEAC mem-
ber Elly Glenn. “They didn’t fulﬁll this promise, so we
want to say, ‘How can we believe you now?”’

Glenn is the acting business manager of the organi-
zation, but members are quick to point out that such titles
exist only for bureaucratic purposes.

“We have a non—hierarchical leadership system,”

explained Kaizer. “Our organization is better oﬂ’ this
way because people feel more empowered to do things

without a president to rely on for everything.”

While only 15 students were present at SEAC’s,

meeting Sunday, group leaders said they usually get larg-
er turnouts for their activities. Although Kaizer hasn’t
noticed a great decline in SEAC membership over the
four years he’s been involved, he still said student apathy
is “a huge problem” for their cause.

The organization has as its primary goal the better-
ment of the campus and community environment. This
is accomplished through such methods as letter writing,
leaﬂeting, protests, and guest speakers.

And whﬂe many of SEAC’s projects are unrelated
to the University, members try to keep a focus on cam-
pus issues. “We always keep carnpus in mind because
we’re the only enviromnental group looking out for it,”
Kaizer said

Business school receives Slmillion to research Internet 

‘Monica Muyk

 

Pitt’s Business School will now
have an extra $1 million for research to
learn how consumers think and to help
merchandising on the intemet.

The Katz Graduate "School of
Business recently established a new
chair, to be funded at $1 million. The
first to hold the Thomas Marshall Chair
in Marketing, Wagner Kamakura took
his seat on Sept. 2 with teaching and
research plans in the making.

With this endowment and the help
of Katz students in his research,
Kamakura will use recent marketing sta-
tistics in order to understand consumer

behavior and then will apply that knowl-
edge as a basis for understanding how
marketing will work on the intemet. .

“One of the goals I have is to work
on the modern aspects of marketing and
how marketing will evolve in cyber-
space on the internet,” said Kamakura.

Retired CEO and Chairman of the
Board of Aristech Chemical
Corporation Thomas Marshall earned
his bachelor’s degree in business from
the Pitt and currently serves on the
University’s Board of Trustees and the
Katz School’s Board of Visitors.

“[This] is a good way of showing
that a prominent alumnus is in support
of what we are trying to accomplish at
the Katz School,” said Katz interim

Dean Andrew Blair. “It means a great

deal when someone of Marshall’s.

stature agrees to provide assistance to
the school. It sends a message to the
community that an important and local
alumnus is supporting our school  oth-
ers might want to do likewise.”

Saying this was a “win-win situa-
tion” that draws both resources and sup-
port for the Katz School and the
University, Blair said that recognition of
a prominent faculty member like
Kamakura will draw interest in the
school from potential faculty members.

“When you are able to attract and
retain people of Kamakura’s stature, it
enables us to add additional highly qual-
iﬁed younger faculty,” said Blair.

The Katz school established the
Marshall Chair in an effort to strengthen
its marketing department, one of the
major fields of concentration within the
graduate school, as well as to provide
prominent faculty member Kamakura
with necessary tools and opportunities
for his research.

“There is certainly a need for
research in business schools,”
Kamakura said. “What I do is develop
tools for marketing research and I try to
use them [in my research].”

Internationally known for his pub-
lished works in “Journal of Consumer
Research,” “Management Science,”
“Marketing Science,” and “Intemational
Journal of Research in Marketing,”
Kamakura will continue to contribute
his ﬁndings to prestigious marketing
and business journals, as well as main-
taining teaching as his first responsibili-

al leader in recruitment,” said Carbo. “He
has also brought minorities into the pro-
gram, and that is especially true for African-
American students who [Josey] has helped
into the master’s and doctorate programs.”

“I have been fortunate to encourage
those who had not given any thought to
going into the ﬁeld,” said Josey.

Although Josey has been active in the
world of academia, he has maintained a
strong presence in politics. One of the feats
he said he is proudest of occurred in 1964
when he urged the ALA to not recognize
four southern state library associations that
denied memberships to African-

l
i

\

Americans. As president of the ALA, he _ 

established the Pay Equity Commission,
which ensured equal compensation for
male and female librarians.

Currently, Josey is part of a team that is
drafting the Library Service and
Technology Act. This piece of legislation
would allow for new technology in
libraries, enabling more individuals to ride
the information super-highway.

“The public library will be the on-ramp
to the information super-highway for the
poor and those who do not have their own
computers,” he said.

Josey retired from Pitt in April, 1995,
yet he has maintained a strong presence in
the school.

“He has acted as a source of knowl-
edge and as a ro1e—mode1 for faculty, staff,
and students,” Carbo said. “Even though he
is retired he continues to work with faculty
and students. He has not led the typical kind
of retirement; he is not staying home and
working in the garden. Everyone learns
from him. He is a source of enormous,
quiet strength.”

there is some apathy and ambivalence from
some union members to other unions. It was
discouraging, but a good dose of reality.
\Vrth IUOE, I made some ﬂiers for a
campaign at the Battle Creek Hospital for the
registered nurses. Later, we leaﬂetted the
same hospital. I was approached by a securi-
ty guard and asked to leave because I was
soliciting. Since I was already tired and ready
for an argument, I said that I was not solicit-

was, “Well, yeah, but it’s still like part of the

side of the street. He said, “Well, I can get the
police to straighten things out if you like.”

routes. In addition, the Pitt Zone, which pro-
vides bus passes at a reduced rate for students,
has been expanded and bus fares outside the
Pitt Zone are 50 cents after 7 pm.

Harkins said that it was only by allowing
PAT‘ to drop 64U and 74U that all the other
additions were made economically possible.

The decision to cut the routes was made
primarily due to a lack of ridership. “When
you get only 20 riders a day, it becomes very
hard to justify running the bus,” Harkins said

PAT provides the University with the
daily number of students who ride each route.
It was these numbers that were inﬂuential in
the decision to discontinue the 64U and 74U.

Many critics of the decision say that the
surrrrner months of May, June, July, and
August were included in the numbers, thus
bringing down the total average of daily rid-

 

ership. But Harkins said that those months
were not looked at when making the decision.

‘ ‘The summer months don’t mean much.
The decision passed because the numbers
were so small during the months September
through April, when school is going on,” he
said.

Still, students like Winters feel that Pitt is
catering to PAT‘ and not their own students.
“Basically, Pitt is paying for PAT to have extra
buses on the routes they want. And the unfor-
ttmatethingisthatitisthe studentsthatlose

In the past, the Graduate and
Professional Student Association (GPSA) has
been one of the biggest advocates of the 64U
and 74U. Despite this, Vice President Kham
Mitchell said they have not taken an official
position. .

‘The transportation to Shadyside and

FROM PAGE I 

Squirrel Hill is still available free to students,”
Kham said, but he refused to say whether or
not ﬂrey were satisﬁed with the decision.

GPSA President Brian Ulery said that
the association was not infonrred prior to the
ending of the routes, and that he was more
concerned about inclement weather than
safety issues.

“When the weatherturns bad, manypeo-
ple will walk through unplowed walkways,”

Ulery said, “in some cases, a signiﬁcant dis— .

tance in very inclement weather.”

Harkins said the decision to end the
routes was not done in haste. ‘There was a
real attempt to have these routes through
advertising and re—routing. The 64U used to
load on at Bigelow, but the students didn’t
like that. So we moved it to Forbes to make it
more convenient. Still, there was not much
participation,” he said.

Pitt/ PAT deal is
great for students

We would like to congratulate the University for ﬁnally
doing something that makes sense. The recent agreement with
PAT is in the best interest of the student body. Although the agree-
ment gets rid of two bus routes which were specially designed for
Pitt students living in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, the beneﬁts all
students will reap from this deal make it more than worthwhile.

The only bus routes being discontinued are the 64U and the
74U, which have an extremely limited ridership. To make up for
the fact that these buses will not be nmning anymore, there will
be an additional 61C and 71A nmning during peak times. Now
there will be a bus every ten minutes to Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill. These buses are the ones generally used by students any-
way.

Students will still be able to ride the 61 and 71 buses. These
buses cover what is known as the Pitt Zone. In addition to that,
students will now receive‘ a discounted rate of 50 cents on buses
that run outside of the Pitt Zone after 7 p.m. That will be a wel-
come relief to students who either live or work in areas outside
of the Pitt Zone. Also, it will aﬂord students more opportunities
to escape Oakland and the University for a change in scenery and
much-needed study breaks.

There has been some outcry from the students living in
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill about the fact that they might now
have to walk a few blocks to get home. These students need to
get a grip. Anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable walking from
the bus stop to his home still has the option of calling Van Call as
opposed to taking the bus. In case they have forgotten, Van Call
was instituted for the safety of students traveling eiﬂrer on cam-
pus or in the surrounding area. All one has to do to use it is pick
up the phone.

Students must pay a $30 transportation fee, and for once, the
University has bargained to give us our money’s worth. The 64U

" and 74U were used by an extremely small number of students.

These two buses cost more than the current deal will. VV1th the
current waste the University has been making by instituting the
new I.D. system, it is about time that the entire population bene-
ﬁt from something. This current deal with PAT is just the ticket.

Words of wisdom from Pitt’s,own sage

More observations ﬁom ﬂiis aver-
age college student:
0 Some of you may remember my surn-
mer column praising WJJJ, the so-
called “smooth jazz” station that went
on the air in June on 104.7 on the FM
dial. I still listen to it almost exclusively;
however, it plays a lot of music that
doesn’t even resemble jazz. I can under-
stand hearing Steely Dan and some
Stevie Wonder — but Whitney
Houston? Phil Collins? Smokey
Robinson? Kool and the Gang? I
0 If there’s one thing I have come to
hate, it’s an unproven accusation of
racism. I refer to a letter in last
Saturday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s
“Sports Mailbag” by Janet Louise
Martin, arguably Pittsburgh’s most
notorious racial reactionary, in which
she denounced the Steelers for not
selecting Kordell Stewart as the starting
quarterback Not only that, she also said
that the city’s racism ruined the careers

of Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, Joe

Gilliam, and Barry Foster. Shows how
much she knows. .

Let’s look at the facts. In the case of
the aggressively arrogant Bonds, while
he was at Arizona State, his teammates
begged the coach to get rid of him. He
talked his way out of Pittsburgh and is
about to do the same in San Francisco
—— and I hear that his father, Bobby, was
the same way. Bonilla, Bonds’ only
friend on the Pirates (which should tell
you something), didn’t do jack after he
signed with the Mets and was eventual-
ly shipped to Baltimore.

Joe Gilliam? Well, I heard that he
was “ridin’ the horse” even before he
came to the Steelers —— and he admitted
in an interview for»NBC Sports last year

that he still did cocaine! And Barry
Foster simply lost his desire to play
football. The Steeler brass knew that;
that’s why he was traded. Iftlrese situa-
tions. look like racism, perhaps it’s
because white athletes generally don’t
posture in the media. Whose fault is
that?

- And speaking of the Steelers, I owe an
apology to Coach Bill Cowher. Like
most in this town, I was sure that Jim
Miller was handed the quarterback job
not on the ﬁeld or on football instinct
but because of that big contract he got
last spring. That’s why he’s the coach,
and I’m just a columnist for a campus
newspaper.

- I think Secret Communications,
owner of WJJJ, had a master plan all
along. Remember a few months ago
when Secret, which also owns WXDX,
paid Sheridan Broadcasting, owner of
WAMO—FM, $14 million to switch the
two stations’ frequencies? Well, with
the “smooth-jazz” format — which, not
coincidentally, appeals to many urban
listeners — and WAMO on a much
weaker signal, Secret was hoping to

siphon off part of WAMO’s audience. I‘

think it’s working.
0 Here’s a hot tip for you jazz—fusion
fans: You may want to pick up an album

by bassist Wayrnan Tisdale — yes, the V

basketball player. The album is called
“Power Forward,” his position. But
trust me, the guy can really play. He
may not be Shaquille O’Neal on the
court, but he sure makes better music.
- In vetoing the partial-birth abortion
bill, President Clinton may have made
the political gamble of his life, and it
seems to be paying off so far. Despite
the predictable outrage, even ﬁom some
Democrats, he hasn’t been hurt in the
polls too badly.

Don’t believe for a minute that the

bill intended to promote the “sanctity of
human life” — the timing of it looked
too suspiciously like a mere Republican
ploy to try to hurt him. If you don’t
believe me, then why didn’t the GOP
bring it up during the anti—abortion
Reagan or Bush administrations, or a
time when Clinton was politically
weak? The truth is, he had nothing to
gain by signing it, as most anti-abor-
tionists won’t vote for him as it is.
Anyway, the decidedly pro—choice
Post—Gazette warned that he’d better
come up with some alternative. Betcha
he will.

0 Cleveland’s recently-irnplemented
voucher program should end any spec-
ulation that so-called “school-choice”
has anything to do with giving children
from more modest means a chance at a
better education. According to The
Washington Post columnist David S.

Broder, the Ohio legislature wouldn’t
approve the program without a provi-
sion which prohibited the use of vouch-
er money to attend suburban schools.

Read: “We don’t want those kids in our
schools.” So much for school choice.

0 Say what you want about the Promise
Keepers, the Christian men’s move-
ment which convened in Pittsburgh in
July, but that group is dealing with
racism the right way, by promoting
committed relationships across racial
lines. I salute Joseph Garlington, pastor
of Covenant Church in Wﬂldnsburg, for
not going to the Million Man March in
Washington, D.C. last fall because “[my
white brothers] were not invited.”

0 To the anonymous person who sent
me the card a couple of months ago:

Thank you very much, and God bless

you too.

Republican politicians
are fond of telling lies
to ”prove” their points

   

The Republican Party seems to love
telling horror stories about the sins of big
government based on facts that don’t exist.
In this era of shortened attention spans,
Republicans have taken to saying quick
one—liners that drive across their point, but
more often than not are untrue.

The man most responsible for telling
stories that ﬁt under the “Wouldn’t that be
wonderful if it were true?” category is for-
mer President Ronald Reagan. The conser-
vative icon was fond of telling anecdotes
that left his advisers scratching their heads,
wondering where he got his facts. Reagan
once said innocently: “I have been told that
in the Russian language there isn’t even a
word for freedom.” Fact: the Russian word
for freedom is svoboda On another occa-
sion Reagan claimed: “Justice Oliver
Wendell Hohnes once said, ‘Keep the gov-
ernrnent poor and remain free.’” When
reporters asked Reagan’s speech writers
about the source of this 
quote, they confessed I
that the President “came
up with that one him-
self.“ Holmes scholars
maintained that the
Justice had never said
anything like that.
Reagan’s advisors were
so used to him making
up fake quotes that once
when reporters asked White House
Spokesman Larry Speakes about a ﬁcti-
tious gun control law Reagan cited, he
repliect “It made the point, didn’t it?”

The Republican successor to Reagan
as party leader, Newt Gingrich, has also
shown himself to have no problem with
making up “facts” as he goes along. To

 

V demonstrate how stupid government regu-

lations not only cost taxpayers’ money but
also ruin our lives, Gingrich claimed that a
heart pump “invented in Denmark increas-
es by 54 percent the number of people
given CPR who get to the hospital with a
chance to recover. The Food and Drug
Administration makes illegal [a product]
that  brain damage, increases the
speed of recovery, and saves money.” That
is a lovely story of government ineptness,
but none of it is true. First oﬂ’, the pump
was invented here in the United States, and
the Danish company that builds it has
never applied for an FDA patent. The
University of California conducted ﬁeld
testsofthepumpandandformdit“tobeof
absolutely no value.”
Newthasgoneontornakeotha‘out-
rageous claims, such as telling an amazed
audience about a fedaal shelter in Denver
thatcosttaxpayers $8.8millionayearto

   

care for 120 people, whereas a similar pri-
vate shelter would cost only $320,000 a
year and would save more lives in the
process. The federal shelter that Gingrich
attacked, as it turns out, doesn’t exist. He
was apparently referring to a private shelter
that receives less than half its budget from
the federal government.

Gingrich isn’t alone in his apocryphal
tales. House Majority Leader Richard
Armey enjoys telling the sad, sad tale of
Charlie, a serni—retarded janitor who
worked at North Texas State University
(where Armey taught). According to
Armey, he became good ﬁiends with
Charlie and was upset when he suddenly
vanished one day. A horriﬁed Armey ran
into Charlie months later, buying his gro-
ceries with food stamps. When he asked
what happened, Armey was told that
because the federal government had raised
the rrrinimurn wage, the University could
not afford to keep him on the payroll any
longer. Therefore, Armey has forever
swom his undying hatred for the minimum
wage and oﬂrer “liber-
al” economic pro-
grams.

It is a sad story
to hear, until you dis-
cover that it is not true at
all. Since janitors at
North Texas State are
state employees, they
are exerrrpt from the
minimum wage, so the
story is simply impossible. When asked,
Armey responded larnely by saying that a
person (“his name was Dale something”)
at the school told him the story.

Republicans often peddle apocryphal
government horror stories that any intelli-
gent person can realize simply aren’t true.
Take, for example, the claim by
Congressman David Maclntosh that the
Consumer Product Safety Commission
had issued guidelines directing buckets in
work sites to have a hole built into them to
“avoid the danger of somebody falling face
down in ﬂre bucket and drowning.”
Anyone with halfabraincanrealizethat
MacIntosh’s story is more than a little hard
to believe. For the record, the CPSC stud-
ied the issue of infants (Maclntosh had
implied that the guidelines were referring
to adults) falling into buckets and drown-
ing, which accounted for 228 deaths
between 1984 and 1994.

The fact that Republicans play so fast
andloosewiththefactsis acauseforcon-
cern. If they see no problem with lying
about nonexistent government regulations,
thenhowcantheybetrustedtotellthetruth

Are church and Pitt separated?

 

There is a serious injustice at this univer-
sity which has been allowed to continue for a
few years. No, I’m not talking about the foot-
ball team or the University Democrats, this
problem is more outrageous. In the
GSPIA/Economics library in Forbes Quad,
along the left wing (how ironic), there is an
area set aside strictly for Islamic prayer.

There is no disputing the purpose of this
space in the library. On the ﬂoor lie several
rugs, and a prayer schedule hangs on the
inside wall. In addition, there is a note written
in Arabic on the wall which, if the translation
is accurate, reads, “Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Keep this place" clean. This means make
prayer without your shoes. 

So'why should I or anyone else care?
After all, the Muslims using this area aren’t
hurting anyone. Apparently, many people
simply shrug it off and turn the other way.
While I was preparing this article at the end
of last spring, I asked several people in the
library a few questions about this issue.
Fellow students displayed characteristic apa-
thy, and neither the librarians nor people
using the praying space knew _anything about
the origin or reason behind the area. It is like-
ly that it was not the idea of the library or the
University, but rather of a couple of individu-
als. They were then probably granted per-
rnissiontousetheernptyspace.Duetoboth
a fear of political incorrectness and a general

anemia, nobody has challenged the use of

that area since that time. Until now.

The Islamic prayer area in the
GSPIA/Economics library-represents a bla-
tant double standard regarding the interpreta-
tion of the Fnst Amendment. If I were to
attemptto devoteaperrnanentspaceinany
university facility to Christian worship, or ifI
triedtoputacrossonawall anywhereon
campus (including Heinz Chapel), I would
be regarded as a religious lunatic extremist,
and my idea would immediately be dis-
missed My violation of the notion of “sepa-
ration of church and state” would be obvious.
So why hasn’t anyone cried “foul” over the

Islamic prayer space? And why can’t I call up
the ACLU to help me protect the
Constitution?

' First of all, nowhere in the Bill of Rights
is the phrase “separation of church and state.”
I actually wouldn’t have a problem with the
area in the library if the interpretation of the
First Amendment were even—handed. The
amendment was intended to apply to only the
United States government, thus the wording,
“Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof...” The writers of the
Constitution even saw ﬁt to allow states the
right to establish oﬂicial churches, and reli-
gious activities in public schools were not
only permitted, but encouraged. But now, in
an attempt to keep Westem religions from
remaining prominent in American society,
the idea of “separation of church and state” is
being invoked. However, Islam and state is
still permissible.

The irony of this hypocrisy is that it rep-
resents a complete reversal of society’s
views. When our country was founded, the
largely Protestant leaders helped establish an
environment in both government and society
that was conducive to the acceptance of their
religious views. Clearly, other religions were
permitted, but not necessarily encouraged. As
lateasthe1860s,thephrase“InGodWe
Trust’ ’ was put on our money. Now, if today’s
liberal elites were allowed to travel back in
time to the founding of our country, they
would accuse the leaders of breaking their
own rules.

Iamnotaskingforareturntothe “good
ol’ days” or for Western religions to receive
any specialrights—-only thattheapplication
of the First Amendment be even and fair for
people of all religious afﬁliations. The area in
the GSPIA/Economics library is a clear vio-
lation ofthat ideal on om campus. Ifour stu-
dent body cared at all about equal protection
undertheBillofRights, wewouldforcethe
library to remove the Islamic prayer space.
The librarians should be willing to listen, and
youcantelltheml sentyou.

When Pat LaFontaine pumped
Team USA’s first goal past Russian
goalie Andrei Trefilov 26 seconds

into S.unday’s World Cup of
Hockey semifinal, Iwondered —
has American hockey finally
reached the top of the mountain? It
just seemed to good to be true.

I was six years old when Mike
Eruzione and the 1980 USA
Hockey team upset the mighty
Russians at Lake Placid, New York.
I can’t remember witnessing a mir-
acle greater than the slaying of the
mighty Goliath that winter evening.

For the NHL-infested 1996
USA hockey team, the success of
this squad has been no miracle.
Team USA remains the only unde-
feated team in the World Cup (4-0).
With 1994 Stanley Cup goaltender
Mike Richter, Washington “brick-
house” Jim Carey and veteran
Mighty Duck Guy Hebert sharing
time between the pipes,.,it’s no sur-
prise that the Americans were the
second best defensive team in the
tournament. 

With the likes of John LeClair,

Pat LaFontaine, Keith Tkachuk,
and Brett Hull on the—front lines, it
was obvious that the high and
mighty Americans would lead the
eight-teampool in goals (19) as
well.

While we’re at it, let’s settle
this Brett Hull controversy. Sure,
the son of the “Golden Jet” could
have played for Canada. However,
the Ontario native’s mother was
born on American soil, therefore
making him eligible to play for
Canada or USA.

Can you blame Hull for his rea-
soning in choosing “The Land- of
the Free” over the big red leaf? In

V-ball faces Wes! Coast

 

The experience and depth
of the west coast offense
reared its ugly head on Pitt
Volleyball this weekend as the
Lady Panthers returned home
with a 1-3 record at the

Powerade—Judy Bellomo
Classic in Santa Barbara,
Califomia.

Pitt (4-4) won its first
match against Utah, 16-14, 15-
7, 9-15, and 15-13, before
dropping three straight match-
es against 12th—ranked UCLA,
11th—ranked Long Beach
State, and the Bulldogs of
Fresno State.

“As funny as it sounds,”
said Lady Panthers Head

Coach Cindy Alvear. “The

weekend went pretty well.
We’ve acknowledged that
we’re not.a top-10 team yet.-A
lot of our players are still look-
ing for their full potential and
used this weekend to gain
plenty of experience.”

The Lady Panthers took
the ﬁrst match against Utah
with the help of senior Jennie
Driscoll and freshman Peggy
Meinhart. Driscoll led the
squad with 15 kills in the
match, assisting on three
blocks. Meinhart added eight

 

kills of her own, registering a

.461 kill percentage in the four
games against Utah.
“A number of her

[Meinhart] stats were up in
regards to attacking and
blocks,” said Alvear. “If
there’s one unsung hero on
this team, it’s Peggy in the
middle blocker position. To
see her go out to California
and actually improve is out of
this world.”

Meinhart has 33 kills and
21 block assists in her first 30
games.

in the next two matches as the
UCLA Bruins and Long
Beach State completed a back-
to—back sweep of the Lady
Panthers. Kim Krull took
charge for the Bruins with 14
kills and 13 digs, defeating the
toumament’s only East Coast
team, 15-11, 15-6, and 15-5.
The 49ers used a balanced
attack, holding the Lady
Panthers to 15 points in three
games combined, 15-3, 15-4,
and 15-8. Five Long Beach
State players finished the
match with at least seven kills.

Women's soccer improving though still losing

Geoff Moak

 

The growing pains
may be easing for the Pitt
women’s soccer team. In
two games at the Navy
Tournament in Annapolis,
Md. last weekend, Pitt

went 0-2, but there was-
improvement _

marked
from the season’s first
weekend.

On Saturday, Navy
opened up its 1996 season
with a 9-1 victory against
the Lady Panthers. Navy
senior 8 Jenny Meyer
scored the game’s first
goal 10:57 into the game.
Pitt tied the game at the
15:26 mark on AideeMia
Mora’s second goal of the
season. After that, Navy
scored five more goals in
the first half to put the

~ game away.

_ But the real...improve-
ment came in Pitt’s sec-

ond game of the tourna-
ment, against Indiana
University.

Pitt lost that game 5-
0, but Head Coach Roland

Sturk was impressed with '

his team’s performance.
For the first time, Pitt
played an entire half com-
petitively. Pitt was down
1-0 at halftime and gave
up only seven shots in the
first half.

The second half
brought,Pitt back down to
earth. By the end of the
game, Indiana scored four
more goals and took 19
more shots on goal.

“We’re still learning,”
Sturk said. “Most of the
teams we’re playing
against are more experi-
enced than us.”

The Lady Panthers are
learning, slowly but sure-
ly. A handful of players
proved that they can play
against Division I compe-

tition. Sturk is learning,
too. He shufﬂed his line-
up in an effort to improve
the team’s defense, which
gave up 24 goals in the
team’s first two games
this season. ,

“We moved some peo-
ple to shore things up in
back. We were worried
about that affecting our
attack,” Sturk said. “It
helped.”

The most prominent

‘change in Pitt’s lineup

involved freshman
Megan Beasley, one of the
Lady Panthers’ top play-
ers. Beasley was moved
from her normal position
of center midfielder to
sweeper.

In addition to having
Beasley back to help, the

rest of the defenders
stepped up their perfor-
mances. Defenders
Rebecca Brown and-

Vanessa Madison were

,,.»,.; . , _ , V . , ,.

both named to the All-
Tournament team.

“We’re most experi-
enced at defender and
goalkeeper,” Sturk said.

That’s where most of
the improvement for Pitt
came. In two games
against Baylor and Texas
two weeks ago, Pitt lost
by a combined score of
24-2 and was outshot 68-
8. Last weekend, Pitt gave
up only 14 goals and 50
shots.

As Sturk had feared,
the defensive improve-
ment did come at the
expense of what little
offense Pitt had to begin
with. The Lady Panthers
managed only 6 shots and
one goal in the two
games.

The team will be on
the road again next week-
end with games at Penn
State and Youngstown
State.

Tyson’s four fights since being
released from prison March 25, 1995,
have lasted less than eight full rounds.
In the latest, Saturday night, Tyson
needed only 109 seconds to “dispatch”
WBA champion Bruce Seldon.

There were cries of “fix,” but
Seldon was simply overwhelmed.
While fans questioned the legitimacy of
the two knockdowns, there was little
doubt Tyson would have made short
work of this challenge.

The Tyson-Holyﬁeld match Nov. 9
could be short, too, but fans and the
people with a financial interest in
Tyson’s career are hoping it will be a
brawl as long as it lasts.

1986, Canadian scout Dave King
visited Hull at his school
(Minnesota-Duluth). King told the
future star that he didn’t have what
it takes to make it in professional
hockey.

USA scout Dave Peterson saw
more in Hull, and asked him to join
the 1986 national team. The rest is
history.

Through four games in the 1996
World Cup of Hockey Tournament,
Hull leads all players with eight
goals, including two goals and two
assists in last week’s win over
Canada in Philadelphia.

Revenge is so sweet.

Speaking of Team Canada,
every buddy of mine and their
mother is complaining about that
crushing loss to those “overrated”
Americans. Talking about the pot
calling the kettle black.

How did Team Canada make it
to the 1996 finals? It took over 39
minutes of overtime and at least six

Pil1’s Pedulla plaes herself i Olypic judo histry

While most of us were at the pool
getting a tan this summer, Pitt biological
sciences graduate student Marisa Pedulla
was training for the 1996 Summer
Olympic Games in Atlanta.

She didn’t get a tan this summer, but
she came home with something much
more. Pedu1la’s sport is judo, and her
training and dedication paid off as she
won three matches and ﬁnished seventh
overall in her weight class (52 kilo-
grams, or 114.4 pounds for those not
used to the metric system).

In the first round, Pedulla defeated
Heidi Goossens of Belgium, then went
on to top Venezuela’s Katie Santaella in
the second round.

In the quarterﬁnals, former world
champion Maria—C1aire Restoux narrow-
ly defeated Pedulla, but the she was not
eliminated. She bounced back from the
tough loss to beat Katherine Brain of
Australia. Then it was time to face the
eventual Olympic champion, Spain’s
Almundena Munoz. Pedulla lost and her
stay at the 1996 Summer Olympics was
over. '

15-5, 16-14, 13-15, 15-10.

The turning point of the match came
late in the second game with Pitt leading,
14-13. The Bulldogs stopped one set point,
rallying to steal the game and the match.

“We lost that [second] game and the
match because of our lack of experience,”
Alvear said. “Fresno State has had a lot of

exposure to the top teams and is very‘

deep.”

Senior setter Stephanie Dufresne had
a successful weekend, assisting on 11
blocks with a .326 kill percentage.
Dufresne also racked up another 134
assists. In 30 games this season, the two-
time Big East second-teamer has 324
assists, tops on the team.

“Steph’s a very aggressive, oﬁensive-
minded setter,” Alvear said. “Fresno State
ﬁgured her out and it rattled her a little
bit.”

Sophomore Jessica Van Der Mallie
also produced positive results at the
California tournament. The 5-foot-10 mid-
dle hitter registered 31 kills, second on the
team, with a .286 kill percentage.

The Panthers hit the road again in
search of a perfect record in this upcoming
weekend’s Colorado State Tournament.
Pitt will meet Pepperdine on Friday, with
matches against the host Rams and Idaho
State on Saturday.

“We played two top-15 teams and we
learned a lot,” said Alvear. “Hopefully, that

experience can be used to make our team

a better one in the future.”

 

Pedu1la’s placing put her tops among
American women competitors, and it
was the best ﬁnish by any American
woman in the history of Olympic judo
competition. ’

Her interest in judo began at age 12
as a hobby to do in her spare time. In her
words, she became “hooked” the first
time she entered an organized competi-
tion.

She said, “The idea of a battle one-
on-one is a such an adrenaline rush. I just
loved the feeling.”

She discovered in Atlanta that the
Olympics were a whole new level of
competition.

' “Everyone’s there to win,” Pedulla

said. “You work your whole life to get
here. As long as you know you gave it
your whole effort, you can walk away
proud no matter what the outcome. The
pressure was so intense, so rare.”

Pedulla was enjoying ‘time spent
with her family in Atlanta when she
heard of the explosion at Olympic
Centennial Park. She was concerned for
the safety of some of her teammates who
were out that evening, but luckily none
of them were in the area.

“The bomb was such a cowardly act
against the spirit of the Olympics,”
Pedulla said. “But you can’t let them
win. You can’t let fear stop you.”

Her biggest fans were the staff she

works with in Crawford Hall and her
advisor. A few of them made the trip to
Atlanta, and the ones who didn’t fol-
lowed her on the intemet.

Pedulla has won numerous competi-
tions in her 14 years of the sport, but she
said the Olympics were by far the high-
light of anything she’s been a part of.

“Representing my country was the
best feeling in the world,” Pedulla said.
“Especially being at home hearing ‘U-S-
Al, U-S-A!’ The crowd was fantastic.
They were so supportive.”

She said she may compete in the
2000 games, but school and teaching
come first. She teaches a judo class in
her spare time for ages 5 and up.

Curtis Joseph for Eric Lindros and
Team Edmonton —— I mean Team
Canada — to edge out Sweden, 3-2.

Team USA basically manhan—
dled every team in the first round,
including Canada, winning each
game by at least two goals. As for
Sunday’s semifinal win over
Russia, the closest Boris Yeltzin’s
crew came within the red, white,

mere 55 seconds, until” Tony

. ‘THE .PI1"I' NEWS

— Team USA versus Team Canada
for the coveted inaugural World
Cup. The fun starts tonight in
Philadelphia at the brand new
CoreStates Center. Just in case you
forgot, this is the very same build-
ing in which the Americans downed
the lowly, evil Canadians in round-
robin action, 5-3. Canadian fans say
that their native heroes were off
their game. I beg to differ.

Lindros delivered a hit to
LeClair less than a minute into the
contest. The Vermont native
responded with the building’s very
first goal, giving Team USA the 1-0
lead. The Americans never looked

 

 

back.

Maybe, with the exception of
Lindros and Hartford Whaler
Brendan Shanahan, the red—leafed
pals are just too old.

Wayne Gretzky is hardly the
“Great One” anymore. Number 99
is only good at best these days.

Mark Messier is a great leader,
but he should be hitting his 50th
birthday any day now.

Ron Francis is old enough to be
my grandfather.

Paul Coffey? You have to love
this guy. We know how he rises to
the occasion during crunch time.

Theo Fleury: you can look up
and ‘watch 6—foot—4 John LeClair
deliver endless checks every time
you come towards the net.

Basically, it’s up to Eric Lindros
doing more scoring and less hitting.
If he and Shanahan are on fire, it
might be a different story.

American fans, let us thank god
that Mario Lemieux is not playing
in this tournament.

To those desperate enough to .

gamble on this game, I’ll give our
friends to the North the benefit of
the doubt —— Team USA in three
games. Canada may have a lot of
individual talent, but the mighty
American team knows how to play
together.
