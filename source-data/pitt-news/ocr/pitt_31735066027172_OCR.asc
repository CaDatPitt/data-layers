Final four Piltsburg
fugitives found in Houston

Marc Nuzzo

iii?

Last night, police apprehended the
remaining four of the six criminals who
escaped from the State Correctional
Institute at Pittsburgh.

Texas State Troopers stormed a
Houston motel room and arrested Leslie
Billingsley, 30, George Conard, 66, Nuno
Henrique Pontes, 30, and Andrew Heirn,
26, without ﬁring a single shot.

Thomas Berklebaugh, 48, was cap-
tured in a Houston bus station last week

Carmen Keller, 36, was arrested
Wednesday, following a high speed chase
that ended in a car accident.

Last Wednesday, Texas troopers
attempted to pull over two of the escaped
convicts, Pontes and Keller, for a traﬂic vio-
lation.

Instead of stopping, Pontes  a
highspeedchasethatlastedaboutthnee
minutes, according to police, and ended
when the convicts lost control of their vehi-
cle and crashed. The pair then sprinted ﬁom
the vehicle.

According to Pennsylvania State
Police, Pontes eluded the Texas troopers in

  

the darkness, but Keller was apprehended
not far from the vehicle by Brandon Bess,
one of the troopers.

Police immediately established a
perimeter surrounding the three square mile
tract of swampy woodland into which
Pontes had ﬂed.

Several citizens and officers reported
catching glimpses of Pontes during the
search, but thick underbrush hindered
attempts at pursuit and allowed the escapee
to avoid capture.

Clad only in a white 'T—shirt and black
jeans, Texas troopers had said they expected
the cold nights to draw Pontes from hiding,
but he continued to elude them.

Berklebaugh has been returned to
Pittsburgh to be arraigned for charges of
escape and criminal conspiracy.

He will be incarcerated in the State
Correctional Institute at Scranton. State
police ofﬁcials reported that prisoners are
not returned to the same facility after an
escape.

After leaving the Pennsylvania State
Police barracks in Findlay township,
Berklebaugh refused to comment for

Muslim holiday 0 Ramadan is
more about fasting than feasting

Hillary Stevenson

 

While those in the Christian world have
ended their Christmas celebrations and look

_ to the beginning of Lent in another month,

those in the Muslim community are observ-
ing Ramadan. Ramadan, a holy month of
fasting, began Friday, Jan. 10.

“It’s an experience of totally putting
aside worldly needs. It is a sacriﬁce for the
sake of worship,” said Hebah Salem, a Pitt
sophomore and president of the Muslim
Students Association.

In Islam, Ramadan is the ninth month
on the lunar calendar. It was during this
month, according to the Muslim faith, that
the Prophet Muharmnad received the ﬁrst of
many revelations written in the Koran, the
sacred book of Muslims.

There are many aspects to Ramadan,
explained Salem. There is a spiritual aspect,
but the family and community are also
important in Ramadan. Through Ramadan,
Muslims are allowed to eat only right before
sunrise and after sunset.

“Fasting demonstrates our submission
to God. We hope to achieve a highly spiritu-
al goal of coming closer to God. The entire
Muslim community will come together to
breakfast every day before sunrise and then
for prayers at our mosque,” she said.

Lastly, there is a social aspect.

“We have a ‘poor due,’ which is a tax

on our income, that goes to charities that
work with the poor.”

Salem also said those fasting are not
allowed to smoke or drink and must stay
away from sexual activity. Only the elderly,
sick, and pregnant women are pennitted to
not participate. Young children may also not
fast, but as soon as they reach puberty,
Salem explained, they participate in
Ramadan.

There is more to Ramadan than abstain-
ing from food, she continued. Muslims must
also watch their tempers and do things for
mankind in a joyous manner.

“It is a fast for our ears, eyes, and
tongues, as well as our stomachs. The aim is
for complete renewal during this month. We
are not to stop our daily life. The idea is not
to sit at home while fasting, but rather to
make it a part of our lives.”

Salem began fasting during Ramadan
when she was ﬁve years old. She recalled
that when she was younger her mother
would let her fast for half—days, telling her
that they would count as a whole day.

“I felt more like an adult when I fasted.
Self—discipline is needed during this month,”
she said. “We have to control our lesser
urges and rise above them. Plus, a month
goes so fast.”

When Ramadan ends, the Muslim
community gathers for “eid—al—ﬁtr,” which is
a feast featuring the giving of gifts and
prayers.

Out with the committee. In with the
task force. C

This change was the major focus of
Wednesday’s first Student Government
Board meeting under new President Justin
DalMolin. The Board will use this new
organizational plan to get more students
involved and accomplish goals more efﬁ-
ciently. .
Many, but not all, of the committees
were dissolved.
Some, such as
the allocations,
the govemmen—
tal relations, and
the community
relations com-
mittees, were
left intact, but
three members
each dissolved
one committee
and proposed a
task force to
replace it.

Board member
Christa Douaihy
moved to dis-
solve the Multi-
C u I t u r a 1
Committee and
instead form a
task force with
the same inten-
tions.

“By dissolving
the committee,
it will establish
a less obligatory
council. There
will be more
emphasis on
[drawing] the
diversity out of student groups,” said
Douaihy.

One other task force to be formed will
be the Bigelow Boulevard Task Force,
headed by board member Jennifer
Molluso. Rather than forming a committee
to deal with this issue, Molluso said that
because the Bigelow issue is a current
topic, not a permanent one, a task force
will be more beneﬁcial to the student body.

The purpose of the Bigelow Task
Force will be to get Bigelow Boulevard
closed pemtanently by the end of this year.
When asked how this task force will aid
the closing, Molluso said that SGB intends
to invite executive board members from
every student group on campus, as well as
administrators, in the hopes of creating a

Short-term task forces replace
permanent SGB committees

united front on the issue.

‘This is going to be a humongous task
force. We hope to work closely with the
administration to get Bigelow closed,”
Molluso said.

The Food Services Committee and the
Public Safety Committee were also dis-
solved. A Food Services Task Force will
replace the committee. The safety commit-
tee has been abandoned.

“There are no pertinent [safety] issues
at this time,” said board member David
Teeters. “We will be able to deal with them
as they arise. Transportation, such as Van
Call and campus lighting, and sexual
assaults are all pressing issues; however,
many of these issues are [Departrnent of]
Transportation and safety issues. We
intend to work with this department on
such things.”

The Board replaced the committees
with task forces because task forces have
speciﬁc goals to begin with and move
faster than committees. Different commit-
tees also have different goals and, accord-
ing to DalMolin, it is hard to keep track of
who is doing what.

“Task force representatives are a
means of interaction for people on the
same path [towards a common goal],”
Douaihy said.

The task forces are designed to be
ephemeral, with clearly set, sho1t—tenn
goals, according to Weidemniller.

“These goals are important this year,
but they may not be next year,”
Weidenmiller said.

The task forces will be constituted in
the same way as the committees, with
applications being taken from the students,
but they won’t be designed to be perma-
nent. They will report to the board on a
regular basis. The direction and action
taken by each task force will be deter-
mined by the director of the task force,
who will be a board member. V

“The director will be the one who sets
the pace,” said Malluso.

Shauna Blau was appointed as the
Community Relations chairperson by a
unanimous vote by the board. When asked
if she will be able to handle the responsi-
bility, Blau said, “I still have enough time
to put forth a great effort. I am the only cur-
rent member on the committee who has
been here for the past two years.”

Adam Neary was also appointed in an
8 to 0 vote as the Government Relations
chairman.

DalMolin adjourned the meeting at
9:55 p.m. by telling the public and those in
attendance that “there is a lot of talent on
this board, and I am proud to represent
them.”

There will be a news writers’
meeting this Thursday at 4 pm

in 434 WPU.

Bill Clinton became the final president to be inaugurated
during the 20th century yesterday.

Looking toward 2000  

Clinton invokes millennial possibilities

Lisa Grzyboski I

 

WASHINGTON, D.C. —-
President Bill Clinton’s imagery of
the “bridge to the 21 st century” was
the main symbol of the inaugural

weekend, and it remained
omnipresent in his address to the
nation yesterday.

As the sun broke through the
clouds and the cannon fired after
Clinton was sworn into oﬂice, the
president began his address by con-
centrating on the fact that this was
the last inauguration of the 20th cen-
tury and of the millennium. Clinton
called the 20th century the
“American Century” and heralded
the coming 21st century as an “age
of enlightened prospects” and a_time
to set sights on a land of new
promise and possibilities.

The opening of his address
included important events in
American history that made this
nation great and a leading power
within world affairs. Clinton attrib-
uted the strength and power of the
U.S. to the American need and
desire for change and experimenta-
tion. He encouraged people to think
back on such events as the great
westward expansion, the civil rights
and women’s rights movements,
and the United State’s participation

in the world wars.

Clinton made a comparison
between the beginning of the 20th
and the coming 21st century. He
stated that at the turn of the century,
Americans were faced with many
choices and decisions; so too, at the
turn of the millennium, Americans
are faced with many of those same
concerns. Clinton said that changes
in industry and the growth of the
information age were two major
concerns for the coming years and
called on the American people _to
make an impact on the world
around them.

“Government is not the prob-
lem, and government is not the solu-
tion,” Clinton said. “We, the
American people, are the solution.”

With this thought in mind,
Clinton remarked that government
has become smaller and has begun
to live within its means. While some
may see this as a negative course to
follow, Clinton sought to reassure
all the American people that this
would enable the government to
accomplish more with less.

“All Americans are approach-
ing a real opportunity to build better
lives,” said Clinton.

He pointed to the founders of
the American government (who
taught that democracy depended on
responsible citizenship), and chal-

lenged everyone to become
involved in the process of making
the streets safe from crime, gangs,
and drugs.

‘The greatest responsibility of
the American people,” said Clinton,
“is to embrace a new spirit of com-
munity.”

While Clinton emphasized the
community aspect of the nation, he
also touched on the issue of race
relations in the U.S. and how they
have affected all Americans in one
way or another.

“The divide between races has
been America’s constant plague,”
stated Clinton. ‘These forces have
nearly destroyed our nation in the
past and they plague us still.”

He was adamant that the
American public not succumb to
these forces any longer, but rather
work towards overcoming them
and moving toward a brighter future
in terms of an end to racism and
ignorant hostility. Clinton champi-
oned the rich texture of the multi-
tudes of races, religions, and cul-
tures and looked to this diverse

group for help in the new century to '

come.
Clinton also remarked on some

of the breakthroughs that have ,

occurred within the last few years
on scientiﬁc, social,‘ and political

Clinton: Is he

Russ Krebs

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Their
hero’s face was plastered on every-
thing from t—shirts and hats to scarves
and buttons. It seemed everybody in
attendance had at least one article
with his name or face on it ——— some
were covered from head to toe with
the stuff. Vendors went crazy trying
to fulfill everybody’s requests. The
music thundered across the lawn, but
the people didn’t come to see the
opening act —-— they wanted their
man.

The crowd had worked them-
selves into a frenzy by the time Bill
Clinton walked out to take the oath of
office for a second time. Euphoria is
the only word that describes the
mood of the crowd when he entered
waving. Nearly everyone in atten-
dance was smiling blindly despite all
of Clinton’s ethics problems.

 



a Republican in disguise?

America is in love with its young,
handsome president and feels he can
do no wrong. This was obviously evi-
dent on Inauguration Day. The only
good thing about this day was that
Clinton couldn’t be his usually-late
self because the Constitution says the
swearing must take place at noon.

Once Clinton was sworn in, he
began his speech but didn’t ramble on
forever as in 1993. Although he
fought with Bob Dole on the issues
throughout the whole election, this
speech made him sound like a
Republican. One of his main points
was to make the government smaller.
He also said, “Government is not the
problem and not the solution. We, the
American people, are the solution.”

These were the main points on
the Republican agenda. He also
talked about getting people off wel-
fare and making people on welfare
work for their money. Clinton’s
rhetoric might make the more liberal

Democratic stalwarts question his
recent campaign postures and ask, “Is
he, in fact, a Republican in disguise?”

Clinton also spoke of making
sure that entitlement benefits are
around for the next generations. But,
most analysts now agree that can hap-
pen only with major reform.
Medicare and Social Security are two
of the largest programs facing major
fiscal trouble in the near future.

Clinton’s speech also had other
problems for the more critical listen-
ers in his audience. A

In his speech, he tried to speak of
the internet as if he surfed to every
site on the web. However, last week
he and his wife said in an interview
that they didn’t even know how to
use e—mail. , _,

Clinton’s speech did not set forth
any new, shocking agendas. Instead,
it seemed to make it sound as though
the Republicans had won a moral vic-
tory, if not an electoral one.

WASHINGTON, D.C. ——While it may
be diﬁicult to ﬁnd a good Philly cheesesteak
in Pittsburgh, the food found the people at
the 53rd Presidential Inaugural Ceremony
celebration.

LocatedattwopointsontheMall, the
area between the Capitol Building and the
Washington Monument, vendors ﬁorn all
over the United States came to bring the real
ﬂavor of the nation to the inauguration.

The atmosphere in the tents was inviting
and warm, despite a lack of lighting and the
grassy ﬂoor that had turned to mud ﬁorn
heavy traﬂic.

Outside the two “America’s Kitchen”
tents, hungry people lined up to buy 50-cent
tickets so they could ﬁll their stomachs.

Inside the tents, approximately 38 ven-
dors staﬁed booths that served everything
from barbecue favorites to international del-
icacies. The thin veil of smoke that rose ﬁorn
the grills and the bustle of excited visitors
seemed to lighten everyone’s mood

‘The secret to [a good Philly cheese-

steak] is easy,” said Laraine Banks, co-
owner of the James Banks and Company
caterers from Philadelphia. “It’s the bread 
and the air about it.”

Banks managed to bring that Philly
atmosphere to her customers, who ﬁnished

' off meals and walked away with smiles and

comments ﬁlled with praise.

“That tasted almost like they do back [in
Philly], and that’s hard to ﬁnd these days,”
said one Philadelphia native to his son as
they walked back into the ﬁeezing air out-
side.

Banks said business was doing well, but
not as well as it had been at the last inaugu-
r'ation’s food vending tent.

“It’s not as big as it was four years ago,”
said Banks. “You couldn’t even tum around
in here then.”

Some lines in the tent were still over 10
minutes long.

She and her husband, nicknamed “Bo
Jack,” laughed and joked with patrons and
other vendors as they served their
Philadelphia fare to the huddled masses.

. Several booths away, an assembly line
of cooks joked about the weather as they pre-
pared Dungeness crab cakes at the booth set
up by McCormick & Schrnick’s Seafood
Restaurant booth, a west coast restaurant that
began expansion to the east this past year.

Patrick Gaﬁirey, the D.C. district man-
ager for McCormick & Schrnick’s, said

 

although his crew was making no more than
usual for this extra duty, the people visiting
his booth were keeping his crew spirited.

“We do a lot of these events, but this one
is really gleat,” said Gaffney.

Workers constantly bustled between
their booths and the same ﬁigid air that
brought throngs of people searching for heat
and the source of the beckoning aroma that
wafted through the mall.

“I’ve just been too busy to take a bite,”
said Banks as she gathered more stock and
jumped back to helping her customers. “It’s
a pleasant crowd, though.”

Many people said they loved the selec-
tion and the unusual variety.

"This is a tasty, nice idea, and I’m enjoy-
ing it,” said a New Jersey customer who also
noted the ﬁiendly atmosphere among every-
one in the tent.

Competition wasn’t a major factor
among the servers. Many shared the respon-
sibilities between their crews. One booth
cooking Thai cuisine shared busboys with
another baking fresh bagels. E

levels. He spoke of the dramatic utilization
of intemet services by those with computer
access and the medical breakthroughs and
cures just waiting to be implemented for
most feared illnesses. Clinton touted former
enemies, now being thought of as allies and
friends, and the fact that more people in the
world now live under democratic govern-
ments than dictatorships.

He clasped onto the catch phrases of
U.S. history, calling it a “land of new
promise” and equating that promise with
education for all students. He labelled edu-
cation as one of the major points he wishes
to strengthen in the next four years because
the wealth of a nation is determined by the
ability and knowledge its citizens possess.

Clinton further touched on crime and
maintained that a strong defense was needed
against terror and destruction of Americans
in general and youth in particular

“Our streets will be ﬁlled with the
laughter of children,” said Clinton as he
painted a pict11re of possibility, “because no
one will try to shoot them or sell them
drugs.”

Turning to the economy and the United
States’ position in world affairs, Clinton
declared that this country fortiﬁes the

world’s strongest economy while protecting
its resources of water, land, and air, and
remains the world’s greatest democracy.
Due to these two factors, Clinton called for
America to continue to play an important
and often times pertinent role in intemation—
al alfairs. However, he cautioned the people
to never forget where the true power of the
U.S. lies.

“Prosperity and power, yes, they are
important,” said Clinton. “But we must
never forget that the greatest strength lies in
the human heart.”

, Using Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream
as a starting point, Clinton concluded of his
inaugural address by asking members of
Congress to overlook their differences and
join him in a pledge to do the best job possi-
ble for the American people. While there is a
Republican Congress and a Democratic
president, Clinton emphasized that the peo-
ple did not do this to promote bickering.
Instead,hevieweditasacalltopreserve
America and what it stands for.

“Nothing big ever came ﬁom being
small,” said Clinton. “Let us not waste the
precious gift ofthis time.  Let us build our
bridge, a bridge wide enough and strong
enough for everyone to cross over.”

America's leaders need

to remember how to lead

As we watch the inauguration of the president, questions of lead-
ership inevitably arise. What a leader must do should be an issue in
all our minds as we watch the posturing pundits at the podiums.

Everyone must be a leader at some point in their lives. The
degree of success that any one of us has when we are called upon to
assume leadership depends on how we react to the responsibility.

The most important fact is that there is a ditference between lead-
ership and command. Leaders are chosen because others Lust them
to know what is best to do in a given situation. Command is ordering
people to do things or else. A command not followed has a penalty
attached to it. _

Leaders have the trust of those they lead People look to them for
guidance in tricky situations. This is not necessarily because they
have the most knowledge. More often, it is because they can handle
information, deal with the people around them, and know who and
what to ask to get the right information for solving a problem

Leaders take care of their people and make sure everyone is
assigned a task that they are best able to do. No one gets left out in the
cold Leaders understand that they must follow through on the
promises they make to those whom they lead to prevent potential
problems before the fact. It is not enough to accept the blame for a
crisis after the fact; leaders need to be organized to prevent a 

Leaders need to be both “idea people” and people who can rec-
ognize and accept good ideas or well-meaning suggestions that other
people put forward Leaders do not judge an idea by the source that
otfers it but by the quality of the idea itself. Leaders should not be
quick to judge any circumstance or person, no matter how much eas-
ier it would be to do so. _

To sum it up, leaders need to understand how to lead by exam-
ple. Ieading from the front, showing people that one can act e1fec-
tively in the situations that arise, is essential They need to realize that
it’s their actions that engender the rapport that all leaders need

As Clinton begins his next term in office, one can only hope he
saw all the faces that were watching him yesterday afternoon and
realizes thathe is the one person in whomAmerica has entrusted the
leadership of this country. Not only is he the cornrnander-in-chief, he
is also the leader of the free world and should remember to lead ﬁrst,
so that command is never necessary.

Great sage words: it just doesn’t matter

 

I just got this wonderful book,
“Sex in the Outdoors”, which has
some of the best advice that I’ve ever
read (No, I’m not talking about the
ways to prevent a bear attack during
sex, though that too was interesting.)
I’m talking about how, in the
Introduction to the Preface to the
Introduction, it reads, “If anybody
takes anything in this book seriously,
they could be in serious trouble,
lifeisfartooshorttobe
taken seriously.” Now, I’ve heard this
advice before, but the serious truth of
the statement never struck me until I
readitinthebook—abookwhich
was clearly meant to be as silly as
possible. Isn’t it ironic? Don’tcha
think?

Now, I have to be careful,
because I don’t want anybody to
think that I’m saying something that
I’m not I am not talking about acting
irresponsibly. I am not talking about
just letting everything slip by. And
most importantly, I am not talking
about being lethargic and not making
an eﬂ°ort. These things are clearly bad,
and I am not advocating them.

I mean that if you go around
indulging in anger, depression, fear,
or any other form of negative anxiety,
then you’re not doing anything
except making yourself and every-
body around you miserable. And life
is far too short to be miserable. In the
great sage words ofmy 11th grade
physics teacher, “Cheer up. Things
aren’t as bad as they’re gonna be!”

Now, of course, you can’t
ignore, suppress, or deny your feel-
ings, and if you feel the impulse to be
angry, or to be sad, well that’s all
right. But it’s just an impulse. Take
note of it and move on with your life.
This is the lesson of all the great mys-

ticisrns which lead people to enlight-
emnent: Acknowledge your feelings
and embrace them. But don’t indulge
inthem.Inthegreatsagewordsofso
many little kids: “Grow up.”

Indulging is bad Indulging is
holding onto negative feelings
because you think that you’re sup-
posed to, or because it’s easier than
taking responsibility for your life and
doing something constructive. In his
fantastic series of books about a
Mexican Indian sorcerer named don
Juan, author Carlos Castaneda oﬁen
emphasizes how his teacher (don
Juan) constantly assured him that the
greatest barrier to freedom is
indulging. He’s right

And who can forget the great
sage words of Bill Murray in
Meatballs. “It just doesn’t matter.”
You know the other team always has
the bigger players and the bigger bud-
gets. And you know that the really
cute girls are always going to go out
with the rich guys anyway. It just
doesn’t matter. Get out there and play
and have fun!

And don’t confuse the meaning
of that statement either. When I say
that it just doesn’t matter, that doesn’t
mean that you shouldn’t care. But
nothing, and nobody, matters in the
sense that they are just oozing irnpor—
tance out through their pores. If
something matters to you, that’s
because you have decided to place
importance upon it. It’s only irnpor—
tant because you decided to care
about it But if you really care, it
would be much better for you to act
responsibly than to indulge in sad or
bitter feelings.

In the great sage words of don
Juan: “To be impeccable is to be a
warrior, and to act otherwise is to be
an ass.”

What does impeccable mean?

Well, this is a more diﬁicult term to
deﬁne. It does not mean being per-
fect. After all, in the great sage words
of Chun from Remo Williams,
“Perfection is a road, not a destina-
tion.” Or in less metaphorical terms,
perfect is a verb, not an adjective.

But impeccable doesn’t just
mean doing your best because too
often people just do what they feel up
toandcallittl1eirbest.Youhavetodo
everything that you possibly can to
reach your goals if that’s what it takes,
asanything1essisgivingup.Inthe
greatsagewordsofSeanConneryin
The Rock, “Losers are always whin-
ing about their best. Winners go
home and f—-k the prom queen!”

Of course, this doesn’t mean that
you can’t make a mistake, or that you
can’t fail. It just means that you
shouldn’t accept that before it has
happened, when just pressing on
could mean success. In the great sage
words of John Popper from Blues
Traveller“. ‘There’s no such thing as a
loser who keeps trying. Coasting to
the bottom is the only disgrace.”

Irnpeccability is about being the
best that you can possibly be and
when you get there, setting your goals
even higher and jumping for them.
But ‘don’t confuse this with just set-
ting goals that you’ll try to jump for
on some other day. You’ve got to start
jumping now. In the great sage words
of Sammy Hagar from Van Halen,
“Right now, it’s your magic moment.
So do it right here and now. It means
everything.” Or if you prefer an earli-
er incarnation of Van Halen, consider
the great sage words of David, Lee
Roth, “You’ve got to roll with the
punches and get to what’s real.” Or,
put more simply, “Jump!”
Kris Kissel has never dated a prom
queen. But he ’d like to. Send letters to

Tuesday, January 21, ‘I 997

 

Welcome to America, folks. When
thinking of our nation’s capital, I envi-
sion the grandeur of government,
statesmanship, ends that justify the
means, idealistic goals, hope for the
future, buildings and monuments that
inspire awe and a reverence for the

history of our country,
and all of that other
altruistic, people-are-
inherently-good-and-
doing-the-best-they-
can, political jazz.
This probably sounds
naive to the jaded
reader, but if the
future ain’t bright —
or at least contains the possibility of
being bright —— what’s the point? I was
hit head-on with this question Sunday
as I visited Georgetown.

I was daydreaming of a new
beginning with fresh ideas and social
programs to be railroaded past the evil
Republican Congress. It is, after all,
presidential inauguration time, and
Bill ain’t so bad. Sure, he’s had a
rough first term: universal healthcare
biting the dust, Whitewater,
Travelgate, Hairgate, Nannygate, Dick
Morris, and Paula Jones’ ludicrous
desire to bring a civil lawsuit against a
sitting president, to name a few of the
bumps along the way. j

However, he was just learning the
ropes. There isn’t any job training for
the president of the United States,
leader of the free world, keeper of the

:44: 

 

THE PITT NEWS

Homeless people are not caricatures of human beings

ﬂame. Last time I heard, there was no
president’s finishing school, no
instructional videos, or self-help
guides. Now, it’s time to get down to
business,

So here’s something to look into,
Bill.

Mr. President, have pity on the
homeless man. Amidst the over-
priced, trendy shops which line the

 streets of
Georgetown, I had the
opportunity to speak
with several homeless
people. I asked them
questions to which I
hoped I would get
answers which,
though not overly
optimistic, would con-
tain at least a smidgen of hope and
faith that things just might get better.
What I found were people who were
simply trying to survive and couldn’t
see there being more to life than just
getting by.

This is not to say that I found the
caricatures of human beings that
homeless people are painted to be. In
fact, the exact opposite was true.
These people are not raving lunatics.
They are not worthless drunks and
drug addicts. Yes, a good percentage
of the homeless are mentally ill or
have problems with substance abuse.
However, the root cause of homeless-
ness is not either of these, though men-
tal illness and addiction make people
more vulnerable to becoming home-
less. No, it is a problem that is eerily
too close to home for most of us. It is

  

the inability to make ends meet.

We’ve all ‘got to work. Well, at
least most of us do. The fact of the
matter is that there aren’t too many
Publisher’s Clearinghouse winners out
there sipping sangria in the sun, laugh-
ing at us poor slobs who have to tow
the line. Don’t forget the axiom that
most people are one paycheck away
from being homeless. Being the presi-
dent, you might not have to worry too
much about that happening to you.
However, the average Joe doesn’t have
your dough.

Now is the time to eradicate home-
lessness. The man on the street just
isn’t too impressed with you; why
don’t you give him a reason to change
his mind?

When I asked Kenneth Broaddus,
a homeless man in Georgetown if he
had hope that you
would do something
to help people in his
situation, he said, “I
don’t think it’ll be no
different. Last time he
was president, people
still didn’t get work.
They were getting
laid off and every-
thing.” In fact,_ he doesn’t see things
getting any better in the future, “‘cause
they’re getting too many people from
other countries in here. They get the
jobs. We get nothing.”

Barbara Jones, also of
Georgetown, wasn’t any more opti-
mistic, “Government ain’t going to
give you nothing ‘less you halfway
there.” _

 

9

Kenneth and Barbara are both pan-
handlers, an occupation which isnot
held to very high regard by the gener-
al public. In fact, panhandlers are
often thought to be making substantial
amounts of money. When asked how

much she pulls in a day, Barbara

replied, “Not enough to get an apart-
ment, a room. That’s why I’m here.”

This leads to the double—edged
sword of being homeless. How do you
get a job without an address to put on
your application? How do you get a
place to live without a job to make the
money to pay the bills? It’s not that
homeless people are lazy freeloaders
who are unwilling to work. When I
asked Kenneth what he would need to
get off the streets, he didn’t say
money, he didn’t even say a home. He
said “If I could get a job. That’s the
main thing.” Until
then, he’ll have to find
a way to survive the
harsh winter winds.

B a r b a r a
echoed his sentiments,
“People’d give me a
job, give me a room,
I’d be more than
happy to [work].”

Mr. President, you’ve now offi-
cially received your four-more-years,
reelection worry-free second term. It’s
time to give something back to the
people who need it most. They aren’t
asking for a handout, just give them a
fighting chance.

Jennifer Sinfelt hopes that when this
term is over; she’s still one paycheck
away from being homeless.

“We owed St. John’s,
but we didn’t come
through.”

When Pitt center Gerald
Jordan tried to explain the
Panthers 60-55 loss to the
St. John’s Red Storm on
Saturday, that was all he
could say.

Pitt tried for 40 minutes
to~repay a debt to the Red
Storm.that was incurred on
Jan. 4, when an 18-point
Panther lead disappeared
into the New York night,
and St. John’s took home a
75-64 win.

Saturday, the Panthers
bolted out of the Field
House locker room and
buried the Red Storm with
11 consecutive points. By

halftime, that lead was
gone, too. It never came

back.

“We weren’t focused,”
said Jordan.

For the first five min-
utes, the Panthers were.
Kellii Taylor started the run
with a tip—in off a Chad
Varga miss. After a Red
Storm_ turnover, Jason
Maile got a long rebound
off his own missed jumper
and scored on the putback.
Varga then swished a base-
line jumper to make it 6-0.

St. John’s Head Coach
Fran Fraschilla called a 20-
second timeout. It didn’t
help.

Back on the court,
Maile connected with a
three-point bomb. ‘Issac
Hawkins gave Pitt an 11-0
lead with a driving layup.
At 14:52, a media timeout
gave the crowd a chance to
voice their approval.

One student section
used the break to taunt St.
John’s guard Felipe Lopez,

a 6—foot—6 junior who had
scored 30 points in the Red
Storm’s last Big East game,
on Jan. 12, versus West
Virginia.

“Lo-pez. Lo—pez,’ went
the chant, reminiscent of a
Bobby Hur—ley masterpiece
of years gone by. Lo—pez
would answer.

At the 14-minute mark,
Lopez hit a three—pointer to
open Red Storm scoring.
He followed with a dunk
after a Pitt turnover. Then
another three, this time
from far outside the arc.
Then, a three-point play,
after drawing a foul on
Vonteego Cummings.

Somewhere in that one-
man onslaught, Jordan
managed two Panther
points. St. John’s Charles
Minlend made a layup after
Lopez had finished scoring

(14-24) from the field in the

Despite poor shooting
(13-30, 1-3 three-pointers)
and a lack of perimeter
defense, Pitt only trailed by
eight, 38-30, going into the
locker room at the half.

If one were to look at

make. The Lady Panthers

Panther swim team prepares
for final leg of the season

A Jeffrey 5 Owen

 

While the ‘temperature
outside Trees Hall dropped
into the single digits Saturday,
the Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team tumed up the heat
on West Virginia.

Pitt improved its season

record to 5-3 by taking first

place in 11 events, defeating
the Mountaineers, 148-86.

The members of the win-
ning 400 medley relay
(3:29.84) were well represent-
ed in other events. Jonathan
Haggerty captured first place
in the 200-ﬂy (1:52.73), Eric
Stefanski won the 200-back
(1251.70), and Scott VanEpps
claimed the 200-breast
(2:09.65). Jerry Koller, along
with Haggerty, Josh Heynes,
and Bob Nooning, won the
400-free relay (3:09.91).

“I was more pleased with
today than I was with last
week,” said Head Coach
Chuck Knoles, referring to the
back—to—back losses at North
Carolina and North Carolina
State. “The team as a whole

swam very well.”

In other events, Pete
Hezky won the 1000—free
(9:45.17), Brenden Lupetin
won the 200—free (1244.01),
Adam Love won the 500—free
(4242.49), and Brian Elko
took first place in the 200-IM
(1257.33).

Head Diving Coach Julian
Krug was also pleased with
his team’s performance, par-
ticularly with junior George
Anderson, a former gymnast.

“Everything was coming
together,” said Anderson, who
took first place in the 3-m
with a score of 315.60. “I was
hitting every dive.”

Anderson qualified for
the NCAA zones, and if he
wins there he will qualify for
the NCAA Championships.
Not bad for someone who
thought he would qualify for
his former sport rather than
diving.

“I don’t have my hopes
set on the NCAAS, but my
coach said if I dive the way I
did today there’s a chance I
could make the cut.”

John Soulakis, a senior

who Krug said “is still our
leader,” won the 1—m with a
score of 320.17.

But it wasn’t just the vet-
erans who impressed Krug.
He has been pleased with the
progress of freshmen Jeff
Raynes and Joe Schuchert,
who attempted a front 3 1/2
and back 2 1/2, respectively,
for the first time in a competi-
tion.

With only three individual
meets remaining before the
Big East Championships, the
swim team will start a new
training regiment known as
the “tapering process.”

“Our goal now is getting
ready for the Big East
Championships,” said Knoles.

For the next 4-5 weeks,
the swimmers will decrease
the intensity of their workouts
in order to recuperate from
their intense Christmas-break
training. Knoles said their
“back-to-basics” training over
the holiday resulted in slower
times against North Carolina
and North Carolina State.

“We’ll be faster against
LaSalle and Duquesne.”

need a publicist to market
him; he’s‘his own biggest
marketing tool. As Shabba
Ranks sang “Sex Sells,”
and no one sells himself
better than the Worm.

Rodman is a poster boy
for the sexy, controversial,
and violent news that most
people want to hear about.
Whether you agree with his
antics or not isn’t the issue.
The focus is that Rodman
creates news.

The most recent
Rodman incident caused
NBA commissioner David
Stern to slap the Worm
with an 11 game suspen-
sion and a $25,000 fine.
The suspension stems from
Wednesday’s Bulls-
Timberwolves game in
which Rodman kicked a
courtside cameraman in his
“man1iness” after tripping
over him. Eleven games is
the second largest suspen-
sion in NBA history, and
will cause Rodman to lose
at least $1 million in salary
and incentives.

Fines and suspensions
are nothing new to
Rodman. This latest
episode is one in a series of

 

 

FROM PAGE 10

controversies that he has
created. For example, when
Rodman released his latest
book “Bad as I Wanna Be,”
he showed up for the book
signing wearing a wedding
dress. Come on, this guy
can even make a mundane
book signing into some-
thing interesting. He’s
doing something right.

Every basketball fan
has seen Rodman rip off
his shirt and expose his tat-
tooed torso after a game.
Whether you want to see
his bare midriff or not isn’t
important. What is impor-
tant is that you did see, and
you remember it. You
remember Dennis Rodman.

So when Charles
Barkley whines and pouts
that he doesn’t want to be a
role model, that’s fine
because Dennis Rodman is
doing it himself.

Ned Schano is the senior
staff writer for The Pitt
News and would like to let
his adoring fans know he
has no tattoos or body
piercings and can really
put away his share of milk,
too.

THE PITT NEWS

Matusic milestone gives way to upset loss

_Bri_an Knavish

Ff

Nothing is more symbolic of

outstanding athletic achieve-
ment than milestones, those
allusive plateaus that everyone
strives for but only the elite
reach.

When we think of sports
milestones, we usually think of
50() major league home runs,
50() NHL goals, or an NFL back
gaining l0,0()0 yards. But in
collegiate wrestling, 100 career
victories is the magic number.
Bryan Matusic became only the
fourth Pitt grappler to reach that
mark with his 4-3 win over
Navy’s Coleman Ruiz on
Saturday night.

“It’s something I’ve been
working at for five years
[including redshirt year],”
Matusic said. “I was excited to
finally get it. Now I have to
work on my ultimate goal of
becoming an All-American.”

The circumstances surround-
ing the victory made the accom-
plishment even more special for
Matusic. The match was wres-
tled at Cannon McMillan High
School, the same high school

  

Matusic graduated from in 1992.

“The situation couldn’t have
worked out any better,” Matusic
explained. “I was thrilled to be
able to win my 100th match in
front of my home-town crowd. I
had a lot of friends and family in
the stands.”

Matusic currently ranks
fourth on Pitt’s all-time wins
list. Pat Santoro is first with 167
victories, Scott Hovan is second
with 117, and J.J. Fasnacht is
third with 114.

Unfortunately, Matusic’s
achievement was the only good
news for the Panther grapplers
on Saturday Night as they lost
21-16 to underdog Navy.

“This is a pretty tough loss
to take,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “We got
pinned twice, which killed us.”

Dan Kelley, Pitt’s third-
string 134-pounder (Chad Jesko
is out with an injury and Ben
Dings failed to make weight),
and 150-pounder Kevin Johnson
gave up the falls.

Pitt and Navy each won five
matches, but the 12 team points
given up with the two pins
proved to be the difference in
the match.

Pitt’s Chris Stevens earned a
major decision with his 9-] vic-
tory at the 118 weight class.

A late third period takedown
by Rob Loper earned him a 5-2
win at 126 and gave the Panthers
an early 7-0 lead.

Pitt lost their next four
matches, putting Navy ahead 18-
7. Larry Sprecher’s tough, one-
point loss at 142 was sand-
wiched between Navy’s pins at
134 and 150. Those were fol-
lowed up by an 10-4 upset loss
by Jacob Schaus at 158.

John Withrow got things
rolling again for Pitt with a 2-0
victory at 167. Matusic’s win at
177 coupled with Mark Bodo’s
6-5 win at 190 cut Navy’s lead
to 18-16 going into the final
match.

“It came down to the heavy-
weight match,” Stottlemyer
explained. But Rick [Vettorel]
was giving up 45 pounds and
came up short losing the match
8-3.

“I was disappointed with the
loss,” Stottlemyer added. “We
knew it would be a tough match,
with Navy beating West Virginia
24-23 on Friday. But it was a
match we should have won.”

play), tying the game at 13 on the
strength of an 11-2 performance by
Lo-pez.

The fans stopped chanting. At
least, for the moment.

“I can’t say enough about
Felipe Lopez,” said Fraschilla.
“He’s going straight to heaven
when he dies. He’s going to be
sainted.”

The coach didn’t elaborate on
his divine prediction, but the saint-
in—question did rack up seven more
points on the evening. Minlend
would lead the Red Storm with 22.

Despite Lopez’s performance,
the Red Storm could not take the
lead early in the first. Cummings
saw to that personally, scoring four
unanswered points after Min1end’s
bucket, including a drive up, over
and around Lopez that got the
crowd back into its hazing ritual.

Pitt held a four—point lead with
four minutes left in the half, but a
late St. John’s rally and two missed
free throws by Taylor combined to
cut the margin to two. On the last
possession of the half, Red Storm
guard Tarik Turner held the ball
until five ticks remained, stepped
around a Pitt defender and sank a
three-pointer before the buzzer
sounded.

“First—half leads in basketball
mean nothing,” said Pitt Head
Coach Ralph Willard. “I knew this

Tuesday, January 21, I 997

 

game was coming down to the
wire.”

An early Pitt lead in the second
vanished, and halfway through the
period, the Panthers were steadily
losing ground. Cummings would
bring Pitt back to within three by
sinking three straight foul shots
after being fouled beyond the arc.

The crowd, long since silent,
started shaking the rafters. They
also shook up the Red Storm, forc-
ing a traveling violation that trans-
lated into a Jordan free—throw. It
would be the last o_f his nine points
on the night.

The Red Storm regained com-
posure and took control back from
the Panthers and the crowd until the
two-minute mark, when Pitt made
its last run at the lead. Maile hit
two free throws to make the score
55-53, and on the next Pitt posses-
sion, Zendon Hamilton fouled
Jordan and sent him to the stripe for
two double—bonus free throws.

He missed both.

“You can’t shoot 50 percent
from the free throw line, especially
at home,” said Willard. “[St.
John’s] made 22 of 27 free throws.
That’s a heck of a job.”

Cummings led the Panthers
with 20 points, followed by Taylor
and Jordan with nine. Jordan’s 12
rebounds and two blocks were also
good enough for the team lead.

B-ball

A defensively sloppy second
half for the Irish led to 20 Pitt trips
to the foul line, but the Panthers
continued to struggle, making only
nine. Notre Dame, cleaning out its
reserve bank in the second half,
shot 32 percent from the ﬂoor (12-
37) but still managed to hold off
the Lady Panthers.

Latia Howard led the way for
Pitt again with 13 points in 25 min-
utes. Melissa Thompson chipped in
with 11 and grabbed six rebounds.

No other players scored in double-

Notre Dame, which had four

15, Molly Peirick had 11, and

Choosing a place to live is difficult but very important and deserves the investment of your time. We suggest

you compare numerous apartments, check out the reputations of the landlords, and talk to the existing tenants

when the landlord is not there. To start you off on the “right” track, call our number (24 hours) and leave your
name and address (and your parents?) so that we may mail you detailed information for your consideration.
