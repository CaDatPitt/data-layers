Coping with seasonal depression

With weeks of snow and more on the way, psychologists and students discuss the effects of weather.

Amy Friedenberger
For The Pitt News

Ben Kendall keeps his blinds
closed throughout the day so that
no sunlight — not even a tiny bit
— can peek into his room-

He dislikes having to look out
the window to see gray, dreary
skies and piles of snow, but he

tries to open his blinds when the
sun is out.

Kendall, a Pitt student, is one
of many people who psychologi-
cally experience the effects of the
current Pittsburgh weather. For
many people, the sight of a win-
ter wonderland is picturesque. It
means snowball ﬁghts and snow
angels.

However, for 14 million people

living in the United States, the
gray skies and short days could
spark the onset of seasonal de-
pression —+ clinically known as
seasonal affective disorder, or
SAD. With 3 to 6 inches of snow in
the forecast for today, the winter
onslaught doesn’t appear to be
ending anytime soon.

, While Kendall said he doesn’t
have the disorder, he said he is

less energetic and more sluggish
during winter. He runs a lot when
it is warm and sunnier, but in-

stead of running during the win-, .

ter, he keeps himself closed up in
his dim, comfortable dorm room,
huddled under blankets.

‘‘I find myself wanting to sleep
in the beginning, middle and end
of the day,” Kendall said. “Some—
times I’ll want to go to bed by

She thinks about her every day, a
lifelong friend who spurred her
‘eternal passion.

Pitt senior Meagan Dooley
thought about Kristine on the
court during her high school vol-
leyball games when she heard her
cheer her on from the stands.

Dooley had class with Kristine,
a special needs student, from el-
ementary school and on. She had
what Dooley described as “an eter—
nal optimism and happiness.” Now
that Dooley is in college, the inspi-
ration from Kristine’s glee pushes
her toward success beyond the vol-
leyball court.

Dooley’s collegiate athletic ca-
reer ofﬁcially ended at Pitt last No-
vember after Pitt’s disappointing
season—ending loss to Delaware.
However, Dooley’s strong work
ethic translates from the court to
her studies.

Dooley isn’t exactly one to
boast about her hard work, so the
Big East Conference did it for her
on Feb. 5.

That day, the Big East confer-
ence’ ‘announced that Dooley had
won one of the most prestigious
awards given to a Big East athlete:
the Big East Female Scholar Athlete
of the Year award. - ’

On a typical autumn Saturday in Oak-
land, Pitt students perform certain
rituals.

Dalel Khalil was no different.
Khalil, a 1992 Pitt alumna, cheered
at football games, drank beer and
ate fries from The “O” — just like
students do today. I

There is one slight difference,

 

 

 

  

 

however: She’s an outspoken, inde-
pendent Syrian-American woman
who dovetailed Eastern and Western
culture to form her own culture —
one in which she is free from any
control. This unique culture is ex-
empliﬁed in Khalil’sself-published
book, “From Veils to Thongs: An
Arab Chick’s Survival Guide to
Balancing One’s Ethnic Identity in
America.” .

A ‘happy medium’ between cultures

Arab-American author and alumna Dalel Khalil publishes book about Arab women’s adjustment to American life and tradition

American world,” she said.

‘ Khalil, who now lives in Schen-
ley Farms, said that when she went
home to her house on Atwood Street
after a night out, she entered a differ-
ent world — one laden with rituals
from Arabic tradition, like serving
coffee to her uncles.

Khalil’s book is a discussion be— .

tween a typical Arab womarf and

herself about sensitive issues, she

said. 1 _ T
“We can’t directly talk about these

issues,”,she said. “We are preparing '

to be ready.” _
Her book is based on her life, but

A she said it is generalized to be appli-

cable to girls around the world — not

just Arab-Americans.

“It’s not a memoir, but it says a lit-
tle about my life,” she said. “It would
be applicable to a girl in France or a
girl half a world away in Australia.”

an Oakland coffeeshop, Khalil asked

Khalil’s tongue-in-cheek-writing

. Rasha Al—Hashimi, anArabic in‘-
structor at Pitt’s Less-Commonly-

the people,”she said. “But from what
I hear, it actually puts the Arabic cul-
ture in a positive light.” ‘ ‘

She also said there is a deﬁnite
struggle that Arab—Americans en-

dure regarding which culture to‘

follow. _

“I see it raising my kids,” she said.
“They just need to ﬁnd a happy me-
dium between their Arab culture and
American culture.” _

Loubna Elabbadi, another Arabic
instructor at the center, explained

the phenomenon of switching be— ,

tween cultures.

“Negotiation happens all the time *

15 percent of population have mild form of SAD

SAD(1

seven o’clock.”
Going beyond the “winter
blues”

An estimated 5 to 7 percent of
the population has -SAD. Another
15 percent experience a mild form
of it, Pitt psychology professor
Kathryn Roecklein said.

SAD is not just the “winter
blues.” It is a form of depression
that occurs around the same time
each year, typically beginning in
October or November and subsid-
ing around March or April.

Roecklein said that like most
forms of depression, SAD occurs
more frequently in women than
men, though the reasons for this
are uncertain. The average age of
onset is 22.

The symptoms of SAD re-
semble those of regular depres-
sion. They include depression,
decreased interest in activities
once found enjoyable, carbohy-
drate cravings, increased appe-
tite, hypersomnia, lack of energy
and social withdrawal.

Roecklein said contrary to
popular belief, the snow and
cold are not factors that cause
SAD — the exact cause remains
unknown. However, if someone
dislikes the snow and cold, it can
contribute to more depressed
feelings.

Research indicates that genet-
ic, environmental and psycholog-
ical factors cause SAD, she said.
SAD can also occur when levels
of serotonin, dopamine or nor-
epinephrine become unbalanced.
Wellbutrin is an aminoketone
which helps to block the reuptake
of norepinephrine and dopamine
so that more remains in the space
between the brain’s nerve cells,
giving the chemicals a better
chance of activating the recep-
tors on the next nerve cell. This
prescription drug helps to ﬁght
the depression so prominent in
those suffering from SAD.

Roecklein researches melano-
psin genes that might explain why
SAD patients are less sensitive to
light. The melanopsin gene en-
codes a light-sensitive protein
found in photoreceptors in the
retina. This is linked to many
non-visual responses, such as the
control of circadian rhythms, the
control of hormones, the media-
tion of alertness and the regula-
tion of sleep.

She said thelconstantly cloudy
sky of Pittsburgh can have an im-
pact on those experiencing SAD.
Pittsburgh averages about 200
cloudy days a year, according to
the National Climactic Data Cen-
ter. The disorder also becomes
more common in increasing
northern latitudes.

- The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, a
manual published by the Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association,
describes SAD not as a separate
mood disorder but as a “speci-
ﬁer.” This refers to the seasonal
pattern of major depressive epi-
sodes that can occur within major
depressive and bipolar disorders.
To be diagnosed with the. disor-
der, a set of criteria must be met
that is listed in the statistical
manual.

A person must have expe-
rienced depression and other
symptoms for at least two con-
secutive years and during the
same season each year. The pe-
riods of depression must have
been followed by periods without
depression and seasonal major

_ depressive episodes must clearly

outnumber nonseasonal episodes
over the person’s lifetime. Al-
though continuous treatment can
help alleviate the disorder, some
people could have it throughout
their lives.

Roecklein’ said cognitive fac-
tors, such as dreading the winter

conditions, can also contribute
_ to SAD.

Pitt student Candice DeNardi"
said she wouldn’t be surprised if
she had SAD. ‘

“The gray skies, lack of sun 
starts to affect me,” DeNardi said,
adding that the sun doesn’t make

it much better because the snow '

turns to dirty slush.

DeNardi feels drowsy around
this time of year, which affects
her ability to focus in school.

She tries to find more sun-
shine whenever it’s available. In
addition to trying to soak in sun
in front of the large windows at
the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs library,
DeNardi walks to classes to be
more active while in search of
the sun.

She has recently started at-

tending the Therapy Dog Tues-

days in the Cathedral, which she
ﬁnds makes her happier.

DeNardi is looking forward to
experiencing more than one day
of sun when she travels to Costa
Rica for spring break.

“Light therapy” serves as‘SAD
treatment i

There are several forms of
treatment for SAD. One of which
is having some exposure to the
natural sunlight on any occasion
where it appears.

Students could be heard cheer-
ing on campus while coming out

. of Towers patio when they woke

up to find the sun beaming last
Friday for the ﬁrst time in sev-
eral clays. Kendall said his mood
improved that day.

“I don’t know if it was the sun
or if I was just having a good day,

but I’m pretty sure the sun'was a _

contributing factor to me feeling
good that day,” Kendall said.
Light therapy is the first line
of treatment. The person with
SAD will sit near the light therapy

box — with a UV shield — which ‘_

gives off bright light that mimics

natural outdoor light.

. If light therapy proves unsuc-
cessful, medications such as pre-
scription Wellbutrin might help
depressive episodes in people
with a history of SAD. Exercis-
ing regularly to relieve the stress

and anxiety that cancontribute to ‘

SAD symptoms can also work as
a remedy, according to the Mayo
Clinic’s website. This is often dif-
ﬁcult, however, because exercise
requires people who are already
lethargic to step out from the
confines of their walls. ,

For those with anticipatory
feelings that contribute to symp-
toms of SAD, psychotherapy is yet
another option. It can help iden-
tify negative thoughts and behav-
iors that make the individual feel
worse and provide coping skills
to manage stress.

Those experiencing the symp-
toms of SAD are encouraged to
make an appointment with a
healthcare professional. The
Pitt Counseling Center, which is
staffed by psychologists, counsel-
ors, social workers, a psychiatrist
and pre-doctoral interns, pro-

~ vides personal counseling.

With a forecast of 2 to 5 inches of snow for today, it might seem like snow and ice cause seasonal depression. But Seasonal Affective Disorder is

caused mostly by other factors, Pitt psychology professor Kathryn Roecklein said.

She said she grew up in a multicultural and

laden with cultural and intellectual stimula-

The community around her was diverse,
and she was surrounded by many Italian fami-
lies ~—- it was much different back then, she
said. A

She said Oakland hasn’t lost its multicultural
roots, though— and being adjacent to campus
is a gateway to a worldrich with diversity.

Also, contrary to stereotypical beliefs, Ar-

A sahara, or" informal family gathering,
would incorporate musicians, Arabic drums
— Khalil plays them herself— and sometimes
the oud, an ancient string instrument.

Khalil said her family would sit around and '

She said music was abig part ofher life, and
she would leave American parties to attend

well as ﬁnding out if any cute doctors were at-
tending the event. Haﬂi typically boast a full

She said that at the base ofher Arabic culture

It is unlike American hospitality, she said.

said. “I think I’ve been my own reference.” .
Aside from her “big mouth,” Khalil also has
an optimistic View of the world.
She said the message she wants to convey
is that we need to come together.
“Lines aren’t so clear as they used to be,”

she said. “It’s critical to understand each other 5

She cited a U.S. Census Bureau projection
that states that by the year 2050, minorities
will be the majority in America. I

She also said more andvmore minorities

That’s the goal ofher book, and using humor
to help is good too, she said.

Apple’s arbitrary
App-stinence  

Apple cuts 5,000 risqué apps but leaves Playboy ‘

y now, most of us have seen
B the range of smartphone

apps — from the handy ones
to the inventive and the downright
zany ones. Some are a testament of
technological prowess, while others
are more mindless fun.

Sex has made its way to the smart
phone, too. It’s presence, though,
isn’t entirely welcome. Apple re-
cently removed 5,000 sexually
suggestive apps from its online App
Store after numerous complaints
from customers who found them
distasteful. But they didn’t purge the
selection in fiill.

While Apple cut some smaller
companies’ sexually suggestive apps,
Playboy and Sports Illustrated’s
swimsuit apps were left alone,‘ ac-
cording to The Huflington Post. The
apps that were removed included
one in which a scantily clad woman
“cleaned” your iPod screen and one
that allowed users to undress a wom-
an to reveal her undergarments.
Supporters of Apple’s decision say
the apps were degrading. Detractors
see this as corporate censorship.
By taking down the popular apps

has opened up the ﬁeld for richer
interests such as Sports Illustrated

. and Playboy. '

Apple is no stranger to controver-
sy over its app policies. The iPhone
began its life as a closed platform
until Apple bent to the pressures of
an annoyed market threatening to
go elsewhere and hackers dedicated
to opening the software ﬂoodgates.

approved an app where users shake
a virtual baby, reports n1snbc.com.
Eventually, the baby shaking app was
taken down, as well.

Now, all of these Apple “mis—
apps” have sparked talk about ev-
erything from free speech to sexual

A liberation. The issue is much simpler.

Apple cares most about its bottom
line and its family-friendly image.

Furthermore, it would be puri-
tanical to say that sex is prevalent
today in all forms of media and still
hold a grudge. Simply put, sex is ev-
erywhere. But the subject matter of
these apps isn’t so much the issue as
the way that apps are traditionally
used and the way they’re portraying
sexual behavior. There’s a big differ-
ence between checking out some
dirty web sites from the privacy of
your bedroom than doing so on a de-
vice that’s usually used in public. .

But as cell phones — and smart-
phones — are becoming more ubiq-
uitous, kids are getting cell phones
at earlier ages. No, dirty apps won’t
cause nearly all the hubbub on par

with sexting, but it would be rea— .

sonable to say that stricter parents
probably wouldn’t want their kids
getting their hands on such lewd
material even if they can encoun-
ter more graphic material online.
It might not accomplish much, but
—— with the iPad o_n the way and the
school hardware market a goldmine-
— it’s the effort that counts. At least
to parents and school boards.

Yes, therewill be that stereotypi-
cal guy who downloads a sexy app
to provide a good laugh or a more
engaging conversation piece to show
to afew buddies. In that sense, these
apps aren’t much different than the
range of brainless apps already out
there. As crude and scorned as most
pornography on the tube and the
Internet is, some of the more “main-
stream” historic installments like
Deep Throat have been heralded for
their artistic value. Conversely, these
apps are the polar opposite: a tacky
portrayal of sexuality that provides
no value beyond a few giggles.

Comparing them to other apps,
they’re not especially creative or in-
ventive. An app that features a pair
of breasts shaking simultaneously as
the user jiggles his smartphone? It
might be amusing for the ﬁrst min-
ute but is it really necessary?

These apps are a testament to the
age-old money-making notion: sex
sells. There are just more proﬁtable
ventures for Apple.

Don ’t let Winter Games slide

For harrowing speeds, surprising skills and strange sports, watch the Olympics

Steve Kaszycki
For The Pitt News

    
 

The Winter Olympics are often
neglected compared to the Sum-

mer Olympics, which are more
telegenic —— they have mastered ‘

the appeal of presenting young,
attractive adults wearing a paucity
of clothing. The Winter Olympics,
conversely, buries its athletes un-
der layers of clothing that would
beappropriate for a trek to the
‘North Pole. .
Moreover, basketball, track
and gymnastics are sports more
familiar in our region of the world.
Curling? Luge? Not so much.
Also, the Summer Olympics
feature NBA players, who tend
to be higher proﬁle than hockey
players —— especially since many
of the elite hockey players come
from and thus play for countries
other than ours. We all adore Sid-
ney Crosby, but when he straps on
the skates for team Canada, he’s

our rival. ,
That explains why the Summer

Olympics routinely draw higher

ratings than their winter counter-

. part. The 2008 Summer Olympics

averaged 27,690,000 viewers a
night, according to The Nielsen
Company. The most watched night
of the 2006 Winter Olympics had
only 25.7 million viewers, accord-
ing to USA Today.

But let’s not neglect the Win-
ter Olympics. The 2010 Winter
Olympics offered snow cones of
fun and shouldn’t be relegated to
the back of the international ath-
letic competition train. You will“

- find incredibly dedicated ath-

letes exhibiting exceptional skill
at sports that don’t have million
dollar professional contracts.
These performers have a genuine
love for their athletics.

Take curling .— perhaps the
most esoteric winter Olympic
event. It’s actually an interesting
strategic game playedout in a
most unusual manner. The athletes

take it very seriously. Some of the
teams talk very.loudly, strategiz-
ing while the disc glides downthe
rink with the aid of the sweepers.
Others remain intensely silent. It’s
like a combination of checkers‘ and
darts, played out on ice.

The biathlon also fascinates
me. It originated as a method

‘for northern European hunters

to hunt, which doesn’t surprise
me. How else would one think to
combine skiing and shooting? Be-

cause it combines two very dif— "

ferent sports, competitors must
master precision and endurance.
After sprinting on cross-country
skis, athletes must take aim and,

_ "as quickly as they can, hit targets

50 meters away with the riﬂes they
carry on their backs. Superior ath-

- letes usually take 20-25 seconds

to hit ﬁve targets 4 undoubtedly

' a difficult task when you’re out of

breath and the clock’s running.
Some sports are legitimately

harrowing. I can’t dream of hurl-

ing down a track at the 90 mph

CINEMA

Dormont theater converts mundane Friday night out into a night to remember.

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Hollywood Theater Feature
“Julie and Julia”

Sunday, Feb. 28 at 6 p.m.
$30 per person — includes
food, dessert, movie

RSVP by Friday, Feb. 26

If you want to see Leonardo
DiCaprio in a mental institution
this weekend, then don’t plan a
trip to the Hollywood Theater.

Located in Dormont, a com-

munity approximately seven miles .

from campus, the Hollywood
doesn’t show the newest movies,
like DiCaprio’s “Shutter Island.”
Instead, the theater screens older
ﬁlms like “Monty Python and the
Holy Grail.”

“We’re a repertory ﬁlm the-
ater,” Jordan Paley, assistant
manager, said. “We operate a
nonproﬁt theater, so it’s easier
for us to get older movies that
way. Would we have been able to
afford [ﬁrst runs]? It depends on
who comes and how many people
show up at the doors.”

And it’s not just a movie that

the theater offers. This weekend i

you can see “Julia and Julia” and
eat a specially prepared meal from
Enrico Biscotti, a Pittsburgh res-
taurant.

The ﬁlm tells the tale of two
women, one of whom is Julia

“We try to tailor the menu to ﬁt

cally try to cater the meal to work
in conjunction with the ﬁlm.”

that consist of dinner and a mov-
ie. Paley said he hopes the theater
gives movie-goers “the older style
feeling of going to a movie and an
event rather than just something
to do” for entertainment.

“It’s a feeling for people who

went to the theater in the ’50s,

and who went to watch cartoons
on screen before their ﬁlm and
went for dinner and got drinks
before and after,” Paley said. “It’s
the feeling of something to be re-
membered versus something to

. do.”

Previous events featured ﬁlms
such as “A Christmas Story” and
“The Godfather,” and Paley said
they plan to continue hosting the
event_with a new ﬁlm and meal
once a month. The dinners mark
one of the ways the theaterhas
changed with the times.

All of this is due to this classic.
old theater reopening with a new

concept.

The original Hollywood The- '

ater opened in 1933 and over
the decades underwent several
modiﬁcations, including one by
Warner Brothers Theaters in the
19405. The theater managed to
stay open until 1998, according
to Paley. .

The theater was reopened in
2007, but closed again in 2008. It

i reopened yet again in 2009. Mo-

tion Picture Heritage Corp. cur-

rently sublets the theater from
the Bradley Center,

The theater’s website describes
the past décor of the theater, par-
ticularly during the ’50s and ’60s,
as artful, with a small 100-seat
balcony, and furniture and a TV
in the lobby. ’ '

In 2006, the Bradley Center
outﬁtted the theater with Dolby
Digital sound, added seating and
updated the projection booth.

Ideas for future restorations
and improvements include a café,
a liquor license‘ and live music
performances. Film ideas, how-
ever, are easily inﬂuenced by the
public.

“We have a suggestion box in
our lobby, so as people suggest
movies, we put them. up as they
get requested,” Paley said.

Currently “The Rocky Horror
Picture Show” is reported as be-
ing in high demand atthe the-
ater. “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off ” is
a popular ﬁlm as well.

Hollywood Theater workers
also have plans to play the entire
“lndianajones” trilogy onscreen
during a single day. This date is

not yet ﬁnalized.
_ In addition, Saturday nights
tend to be more of a cult movie
night “so everyone can have a re-
ally weird, fun time,” Paley said.

The theater has also made
plans to host independent ﬁlm
festivals when possible.

- “We plan to bring independent
ﬁlm festival ﬁlms and ﬁlms not
given regular distribution the
chance to play in theater,” Paley

said. “We’d like to have directors .

there for Q&A afterwards. Not
a lot of independent ﬁlmmak-
ers get to see their ﬁlms on the
screens.”

Beyond their special events,
the Hollywood operates much like
a normal theater during the week.
Its prices vary from $4 to $6, and
it sells ‘food and drink to go with
itsﬁlms. '

“The plan is to just give the’
best program we possibly can to
everyone in the city,” Paley said.

“We feel strongly the concept of 9

a movie as an event will make
people love our theater and will
keep people coming to the mov-
ies again.”

ANALYSIS

Music ruts come
from iPod laziness

What are the solutions to an uninspiring playlist?

Kelsey Shea
Asst. A&E Editor

 

I’m in a rut — a music rut, that is.

I’m stuck in the A’s list of my iPod. My
musical spectrum has been some randomly
selected combination of The Avett‘Brothers,
The American Analog Set, Adrienne Young
and Adele. Why Ks?

It’s partly because I’m too lazy.and unin-
spired to scroll down any further, and partly
because there are a lot of good bands and art-

ists whose names begin with the letterA at my '

disposalwithout so much as a ﬂick of aﬁnger.
It’s pretty pathetic.

I just haven’t stumbled upon anything new
that’s struck me. *

I’m not alone, though. Ruts happen to all
music lovers at some point or another. Blog-
gers are known to throw out requests for
their readers to throw out some suggestions
to help them out. Sadly, not everyone has a

‘ blog following her music woes and so most .

of us have to ﬁnd new ways to pull ourselves
out of them.

To some extent, I guess I can blame mid-
terms and the gloom of late February for my
lack of initiative — but, I’m done making ex-
cuses. It’s time to get out of my rut in the ways
I knowhow.

1.) Pandora — I know I’ve harped about

how freaking awesome Pandora is before, but I
really can’t get past how much I love it. It’s ideal
for this kind of situation. It’s pretty much made
for matching you with what you like. My only
complaint about Pandora is that sometimes
it’s too good. A lot of the time I know nearly
every band that comes up on a given station,
but when I’m on a mission to ﬁnd something
new it can be frustrating.

Results: Badly Drawn Boys, Band of Hors-
es

2.) Blogs —— This is not as easy as Pandora
because it does take some scouring the big

wide Internet, but just reading  reviews “

can help tip you off to what you want to know
pretty quickly. More importantly, it can also
inform you as to whether an album’s worth
your time. Many blogs, like Pitchfork, even
have music players on the site — so you don’t
have to jump around the web looking for free
streaming. .

Finds: Spoon’s new album.

-3.) Friends -— Sometimes one of the best
ways is to just toss your ﬂash drive to one of
your music-geek friends and tell her to give you
something new. The people who know you -
and your ever-so—reﬁned tastes 4- more often
than not can hit the nail right on the head.
Plus, when the aforementioned new discovery
comes to town, you’ll know who to call!

Even after multiple Gramrnies,
a liberated South Africa and col-
laborations with Paul Simon and
Michaeljackson, Albert Mazibuko
still remembers the time when,

during apartheid, he and the rest .

of Ladysmith Black Mambazo
had to sing for a police commis-
sioner. ' .
This was a familiar routine -
the police would ask the group

what gave them permission to

travel, and in return, the group
would try to sway the police with
their music. In this instance, the
approach worked especially well.

“We did our magic singing
for him, and then he said, ‘What
you do is very good, you should
have permission to go everywhere

where you want to go,”’ Mazibu— '

ko said. “We’re the ﬁrst group in
South Africa to have the permis-

* sion to travel freely.”

Formed in the ’6os by Mazibu-
ko’s cousin,]oseph Shabalala, La-
dysmith Black Mambazo — which
will bring its Pitt Arts-sponsored
“magic singing” to the Byham this
Sunday — is now one of the most
famous and iconic singing groups

in the world. But the rise of an all- ’

black choir — especially amidst

the chokehold of apartheid — took ‘
-, more than just hypnotic music.

“That was a great challenge,”
Mazibuko ‘said of the apartheid
years. “Because of that, we had
to have permission to be in one
place.” '

Their big break came when

that would otherwise ramp up the suspense —

early in the ﬁlm.

There are a series of global satellite shots
scattered throughout the movie that scream
government involvement—and, surely enough,
theArmy swoops inandturns a good 25-minute
portion of theﬁlm into a failed attempt at chan-
nelling-Holocaust overtones. Unexpectedly,
then the ﬁlm transitions into a “survival of the
protagonists”-type ﬁlm, all the while inserting
the typical slasher ﬁlm “Gotcha!” scenes.

(6

The director should .

get props, however, for
making an unrelenting, ‘
straight-faced scare ﬂick.

“The Crazies” is by no means a bad ﬁlm. The
directing is solid — if occasionally monotonous
—— and it’s nice to see a horror ﬁlm shy away
from the hyper-stylized sort of camera work
that countless other scare ﬂicks have embodied
over the past few years. Olyphant and Mitchell
turn in perfectly adequate performances, with
the former especially committed to keeping a
straight face even through some of the ﬁlm’s

more ridiculous moments.
The problem with the movie, then, ‘lies in

~ that it really seems like a patchwork of mini-

ﬁlms stitched together into a less-than-desir-
able result. It starts out as a typical horror-.
suspense ﬁlm, but then abruptly transitions
into military territory a la “28 Days Later” and
“28 Weeks Later.” The survival genre the ﬁlm
ends on is easily the strongest of the three parts,
butfor some reason Eisner insisted on trying to
bring back the.horror elements found earlier
in the ﬁlm.

Horror fans like to be entertained and
scared, not pandered to, and this seems like
exactly what Eisner attempted to do. Still, cer-

tain scenes make you wish Eisner would stick to ~

ﬂat—out horror ——- perfectly-shot and paced set
pieces in a car wash and a morgue are hopeful
indications of the director’s talent.

The director should get props, however, for
making an unrelenting, straight—faced scare
ﬂick. You won’t ﬁnd any self—referential wink-
wink, nudge-nudges here. The realistic style
is refreshingly grim, and the violence in the
ﬁlm is indeed brutal. However, those scenes
are not taken to a cartoonishly gory level like
in the "Hostel” series, and never does it ap-
pearas though Eisneris relishingthe on-screen
brutality. ' -

Directors in the “Saw” series, take note,
because you could learn a lot.

Chances are you will forget “The Crazies”
soon after you leave the theater, but fear not.
Take it for what it is, and remember —— don’t

Ladysmith strong since the ’ 60s H

South African band collaborates with Paul Simon, commemorates Nelson Mandela A

Ladysmith < 12

his now—legendary 1986 album Graceland.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo was one such
band.

“We were very concerned,” Mazibuko
said. “We said, ‘Wow! He sings "a different
kind of music. How is he going to work.with
us?!” ‘

Their answer came in the form of a demo
Simon sent the group — a simple two verses
that would later become their most famous

- song, “Homeless.” After an unsuccessful

ﬁrst day of recording, the group assembled
that night to pray and practice the song until
they nailed it. The next day, they came to
the studio prepared.

 

After We sang that song,
we felt his spirit was
around us.

Albert Mazibuko

“We sang the whole song for him,” Mazi-

buko said. “He said, ‘This is the one.”’ ,
The group’s two songs on Graceland —

“Homeless” and the jaunty “Diamonds On
the Soles Of Her Shoes” — vaulted them
onto the international stage. Since then,
Ladysmith Black Mambazo has known nu-

merous brushes with celebrity, recording.
with artists ranging from Dolly Parton to

Stevie Wonder. . .

But perhaps no moment in the group’s
post-Gracelandcareer is as special to Maz-
ibuko as its numerous performances for
Nelson Mandela. In particular, Mazibuko
recalled the ﬁrst time he and his bandmates
met the leader: Mandela’s birthday party.
The South African icon was so taken by their
music that he began to dance with them
onstage. Later, Mandela told them that their
music had given him “great inspiration”
while he was in jail.

. “[Performingfor Mandela] was like when p

you are a child at Christmastime,” Mazibuko
said. “To meet Mandela —— to see him so
closely — you don’t know how to express
the gratitude that we have.”

Unfortunately, such idyllic moments

were too often counterbalanced by trag-
edy. Perhaps one of the most famous tragic
events is when an off-duty security guard
murdered a member of the group, Headman
Shabalala, in 1991.

u “We sang asong that we just ﬁnished re-

cording at that time. After we sang that song,
we felt his spirit was around us,” Mazibuko
said. “He is not gone. He is with us.”
Though the world that surrounds Lady-
smith Black Mambazo is far from ideal, joy
permeates every album, every performance.

Annabelle'Clippinger, director of Pitt Arts’, _

encouraged students to take advantage of

their performance in conjunction with Pitt

Night. V _ .

“It’s a chance to experience music from
South Africa —— really very roots kind of mu-
sic,”.Clippinger said. “We can understand,
we can learn about the culture through the

- music. All barriers are stripped away.”

While ‘Mazibuko comes from a radically

different background, he would almost cer-

tainly agree -— Ladysmith Black Mambazox

still subscribes to the philosophy of its for-
mative years, when the members were still
entrenched in apartheid. '

“We had a kind of belief that, when it
comes to music, there’s nothing that you
cannot achieve,” Mazibuko said.

Dooley fourth panther to win accolade

Pooley < 1

a certiﬁcate in children’s literature,
said. “But I was shocked because I
neverthoughtitwould actually be me
out of all the Big East schools.”
Dooley became the fourth Pitt
student-athlete named Female Scholar
Athlete of the Year and the ﬁrst since
former track and ﬁeld standout Na-
juma Fletcher earned the recognition
in 1996. She is also the ﬁrstvolleyball
player in the conference to win‘ the

“award since 1988, when Pitt’s Noreen

Coughlin won it. I

The award is no surprise to those
know her best. _

“One of the great things about
Meagan is she deserves every award
she gets because she puts a lot of time
and effort into those accolades,” Pitt
women’s volleyball coach Toby Rens
said. “She knew what mattered most
to her, and tl1at’s beingvery successful
on the court and in the classroom.”

It’s ﬁtting that when her coach

Wwanted to tell her about the award,

she was busy working at Panera.
She stood at the register, not as a
decorated volleyball player, but as a
cashier, making bagels and keeping
things organized.
She felt the incessant buzzing of
her phone, a phone call.
Finally on her break, she checked

 

certiﬁcation in special education. She

 

the message.

It was a voicemail from Rens‘.

She knew the men’s scholar athlete
was announced the previous day and
ﬁgured the women’s armouncement
was coming that day.

But she didn’t expect the congratu-
lations comingﬁorn her coach on the
voicemail. Itwas ashock, Dooley said,

,. and she had to check the Big East’s
, website on her phone before calling
her parents with the news.

Dooley, who has a 4.00 GPA, was
an ESPN The Magazine Academic
All-America First Team selection in
2009 and is athree-time Big East All-
Academic pick. I

Dooley won the award, selected
by the conference’s Academic Affairs
Committee, with herunique combina-

_ tion of superior athletic achievement
and academic determination. The -

award, gven to one man and woman

4 from all of the Big East schools per

year, also grants the winnera $4,000
scholarship to use toward graduate
studies.

The award only cemented Dooley’s
ﬁiture plans.

She plans to attend Pitt’s Gradu-
ate School ofEducationforaone-year
program to receive her master’s and

hasn’tbeen notiﬁed she’sbeen accept-
edyet, butDooley said she “anticipates
getting in.” '

“I deﬁnitely want to get in the
classroom for the ﬁrst few years and
see how it goes, then possibly move
into administration at some point,”
Dooley said.

Dooleywon’tlethervolleyballpas-
sion subside to herteaching. She hopes
to coachthe level shewillbe teaching.
Herhigh school coach at LakotaWest
High Schoolhasalready spokentoher
about joining his staff.

“That’s always an option, going
back to my hometown and coaching
there and teachingthere,whichwould
be great,” Dooley said.

Those high schoolkids betterhang
on Dooley’s every word. She knows
a thing or two about racking up kills

and blocking.

After four seasons with the Pan-
thers, Dooley is second overall in Pitt
history in career total blocks (519),
block assists (394) and solo‘ blocks
(125).

A perfect block has three very
distinct sounds. One after another,
the sound of synthetic leather pan-
els, layered over a cloth layer, layered
further over a rubber bladder, which
is otherwise known as a standard,
NCAA-approved volleyball, striking
an opposing player’s cupped palm.

Then, maybe two milliseconds later,
the ball again strikes Dooley’s hands,
only to barely an instant later, slam
down on the Fitzgerald Field House
hardwood ﬂoor. A

It sounds something like, “BAM!
BOOM! 'BAM!” Three clear sounds,
two hands, one point Pitt.

Dooley’s block electriﬁes the
crowd. She pumps her ﬁst, shouting
“Yeeaaahhh!” as she strides into the
huddle with her teammates.

_ “I would say the thingthat pumps
me up the mostisblockingsomeone’s
hit straight to the ground but getting

a really great kill is deﬁnitely a close '

secon ,” Dooley said.

Her determination on the court
carries off of it, and she said she was
always interested in education, even
at an early age.

“I was always the little kid playing
schoolinourbasement and really into
whatever teachers were doing, wheth-
eritwas gradingpapers, oranything,”
Dooley said.

According to some teammates, it
didn’t stop when she was young.

“It’s kind of the joke on the team,”
junior Amy Town said. “Whenever
anything happens, like when she
writes things on the board, packing
lists for road games, it’s always really
neat and in good writingandwe would
always say, ‘She’s such a teacher.”’

.‘~.;-,..,,,.,.,..,,. ~. ».-...:._ _v -

Perhaps it’s also the reasonforher
early morning study habits on road
trips.

Rens said he would oﬁien spot
Dooley reading on the coach bus the
morning before matches, way before
any other teammates would rise.

‘A typical road trip is Meagan
studying on the bus for hours,” Rens
said. “She’s very dedicated, very fo-
cusedallthe time.” ‘

Herfocus and determination only
bring her closer to a teaching career.

Teaching is Dooley’s dream. It’s a
dream that started with knowing a
single person: Kristine.

Today, Dooley doesn’t talk much
withKristine,whostill1ivesinDooley’s
hometown ofWest Chester, Ohio. But
she still marvels at her unremitting
pleasantness.

“She was always laughing and
enjoying whatever she was doing,”
Dooley said. “This is incredible to me
whenyou reallythinkabout the cards
she has been dealt in life.”

There’s an old saying, reiterated in
the movie “SixDegrees ofseparation,”
that reads, “Everypersonisanew door
to a different world.”

Kristine brought joy to part of
Dooley’s life. It’s ﬁtting, in return,
that Dooley will carry that same joy
with her the rest ofher life, a giftto her
students who need it the most.

Panthers offense left on the bus in Indiana

Pitt men’s team loses 68-53 at Notre Dame last night

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ'Wri ter

No Luke Harangody, no problem.
Harangody missed his third
straight game with a right knee in-
jury, but four of his fellow Irishmen
stepped up and scored in double-
digits, and Notre Dame defeated
visiting Pitt last night, 68-53.
Forward Tim Abromaitis led
all players with 17 points, nailing
3-of-5 shots from beyond the arc.
The Fighting Irish shot 75 percent
on 3—pointers in the ﬁrst half to open
up a 35-27_ lead, and they ﬁnished
10-of-18 from deep against the Big
East’s best 3-point defense.
Jermaine Dixon scored a team-

‘ high 13 points for the Panthers, who

drop to 10-5 in the Big East and 21-7
overall. The loss all but eliminates
Pitt’s chances of winningthe confer-
ence, as the team now trails Syra-
cuse by three games with three left
to play.

While Notre Dame’s hot shooting
helped end athree—game losing skid,

Pitt struggled to generate anything
offensively. The Panthers made just
4—of—18 3-point attempts, and Dixon,
Gilbert Brown and Travon Wood-
all went a combined 0-for—1o from
downtown.

. While Notre Dame’s '
‘ hot shooting helped
end a three-game
losing skid, Pitt _
struggled to generate
anything offensively.

The Fighting Irish pulled away
in the second, expanding the lead
from eight to 23 in the half ’s ﬁrst 11
minutes. Pitt had just 15 points in
the half before a ﬂurry of scoring in

» the game’s ﬁnal minutes lessened

the margin of defeat.
Tory Jackson and Tyrone Nash

provided 14 and 13 points, respec-
tively, for Notre Dame. Guard Ben
Hansbrough, younger brother of
former North Carolina star Tyler
Hansbrough, ﬁnished one rebound
shy of a double-double for the Fight-
ing Irish. The senior had 15 points
and 9 rebounds. 4
Overall, Notre Dame out-re-
bounded Pitt, 31-21. Gary McGhee
and Dante Taylor struggled to get

touches down low throughout the

game, as the‘ duo ﬁnished with 9
points combined.

Behind Dixon on the score sheet,
Ashton Gibbs ﬁnished as the only
other Panther in double-digits,
knocking down 11 points.

Notre Dame climbed to a four-
way tie for eighth place in the Big
East. The Irish now stand at 7-8 in
the conference and 18-10 overall.
The team next faces Georgetown
Saturday afternoon.

Pitt also returns to action Sat-
urday afternoon, when it travels to
New York to face St. John’s. The Red
Storm will seek revenge for its loss
to the Panthers last month.

The Pitt baseball team won two of
three games in its season open-
ing series at Wofford this past
weekend. ‘

In the first game of the se-
ries, an 18-6 win, junior third
baseman Joe Leonard went 2 for
6 with three runs and six RBIs.
His performance was highlighted
by a third inning grand slam to.
cap a seven—run inning.

Junior pitcher and ace of the
staff, Corey Baker picked up the

- win, going seven innings while

allowing five runs on seven hits
with nine strikeouts.]unior Cole
Taylor came in on relief to pitch
two perfect innings and preserve
the win.

Taylor might eventually be
used as a starter this year as well,
especially with more outings like
the one on Friday. ‘

“He’s ‘shown he did pretty
good relieving but Ithink if he

keeps on going he-should be a

starter here shortly,” Leonard I

said of his teammate.

“Mg

Our coaches-I stress
two-out'hits a lot.
Every day in practice
we work on it

Joe Leonard

In the second game of the se-
ries Leonard continued his hot
hitting, going 3-of-4 with three
RBIs. The Panthers had a slim
4-3 lead in the eighth inning but

. clutch hitting by Leonard and ju-
Inior catcher Kevan Smith with

two outs led to three insurance
runs and a 7-3 win.

“Our coaches stress two-out
hits a lot.‘ Every day in practice

we work on it,’7 Leonard said.
“Especially when there’s run-
ners on you have to hit the ball
hard somewhere and get the job
done. ‘ j j '

Pitt received another strong
pitching performance in the
game as sophomore Matt Ian-
nazzo gave up five runs on two
hits with seven strikeouts in 5
1/3 innings.

Looking for the sweep in the-
third game of the series, the Pan-

T thers came up just short, losing

9-8 in 10 innings.

Heading into the bottom of
the seventh inning, the Terriers
trailed 6-2 but burst out for a
six-run inning to take a two-run
lead. A two—run home run in the

eighth inning by the Panthers’.

Zach Duggan — also with two
outs — tied the game,,ultimately
sending it into extra innings.

SOFTBALL

Despite weakopener, team shows ‘signs of success’

Pitt’s softball team looks to build on strong points of Florida invitational

 

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ‘Wri ter

The Pitt softball team traveled to
sunny Boca Raton, Fla., this past
weekend to open its season in the
Florida Atlantic Invitational.

In ﬁvegames, the Panthers de-
feated Minnesota twice but fell to
Mississippi, Kentucky and Maryland,
ﬁnishingwith a 2-3 record in the early
stages of the season.

Head Coach Holly Aprile said that .

her team showed signs of success in
its ﬁrst tournament,’ despite the ini-
tial losing record.

“Obviously, we wanted to win all
of our games, but we also wanted to
set a positive tone on both offense
and defense,” Aprile said. “We ﬁn-
ished 2-3, but there were a lot of
good things that happened that we
can build on.”

One of those areas is the pitch-
ing performance of junior Alyssa
O’Connell.

. nesota, O’Connell earned her ﬁrst

seven-inning shutout in the Panther’s
2-0 victory.

O’Connell recorded three strike-
outs, gave up only four hits in this
contest and also closed out a4—2 vic-
tory over Minnesota in the ﬁfth and

ﬁnal game of the invitational.

 

We ﬁnished 2-3, but
there were a lot of good
._-things that happened
that we can build on.

Holly Aprile '

Chris Neverman | STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

In Pitt’s ﬁrst game against Min-

Aprile looks to O’Connell for lead-
ership on the team and believes that
her performance will only improve.

“[O’Connell] is a very hard
worker,” Aprile said. “I expect her

to get better and better because she
is avery committed and determined
individual.”

‘ In the Panthers’ ﬁrst two losses
—~ at the hands of Mississippi and
Kentucky —— offensive production
was a problem, as they failed to score
in a 3-0 contest against Mississippi
and posted only one run in a 2-1 de-
feat to Kentucky.

Pitt had opportunities to score
against Mississippi, but could not
capitalize on them as two base run-
ners were left stranded in scoring
positions.

One bright spot in the offense,
however, was the solid plate perfor-_

‘mance of freshman catcher Holly °’

Stevens.

Stevens recorded her ﬁrst home
run in the Panthers’ ﬁrst win and
tacked on another solo shot as the
Panthers fell to Kentucky.

According to Aprile, there is.
sufficient talent around Stevens to
facilitate yet more scoring chances
for the Panthers.

Pitt junior Alyssa O’Connel pitches for the panthers who ﬁnished 2-3
at the Florida Atlantic Invitational last weekend.

Shaun White won the gold medal for the men’s hallpipe competition.

 

_ Evan Burgos

Leading up to the Winter Olympics in Vancou-
ver, the Canadian Olympic Committee launched
a $117 million national campaign. Itwas called
“Own the Podium” and was meant to repre-
sent the host nation’s conceited approach to
the games.

The campaign, which reportedly included
$66 millionintaxdollars, represented Canada’s
lotty hopes that ——“ while on home soil — its
athletes would showcase to the world that the
big country just north of the United States could
be the best at something, too.

As the Olympic fortnight nears an end, how-
ever, Canada hasn’t owned much of anything.
In fact, the ill-fated campaign has done more to
tarnish the nation’s reputation thanimprove it.
One could even say that the games have been
borderline embarrassing. ‘ A

It began with a tragedy that.was all-but-
buried in the Whistler snow. On the eve of the
games, during a practice run, Georgian luger

Nodar Kumaritashvili, 21, died after crashing
into a metal beam. He came out of a sharp turn
unduly fast.

Though mourned, Kumaritashvili’s death
was quickly swept away so as not to linger over
the games. The International Olympic Com-
mittee quickly claimed it was a freak accident
and that the course, which runs on average
5.5 percent faster than any other in the world,
was safe. ‘

It was almost convenient that 
was from a small, former Soviet nation, and
not some place like the U.S. or Canada, because
the swift dismissal and omission of guilt was
not loudly questioned. Canada couldn’t afford
that blemish to be brought upon its Olympics.

The games were off and running.

Throughout the ﬁrst week of competition,
Canada —— which had projected itself to be a
top competitor at these games — faltered. As
of Wednesday, Canada was ﬁfth initotal med-
als with 11, while the U.S. was ﬁrst with 26.
The heavﬂy-favored Canadian men’s hockey
team lost to an inexperienced young American
outﬁt and failed to get a bye in the elimination

round.
Monday, the Canadian Olympic Committee

announced that it was officially ditching its
highly—touted podium goal. Canada had hoped V

to improve on the 24 medals it won at the Turin
games four years ago, but wasn’t even half—way
there. Itwas embarrassed. For once, the quiet
country north of the border had decided to be
a little cocky, and it got burned for it.

If we knew what they
' V were doing, we’d be
doing it too.
Michael Chambers

. Instead, these games are on par with previ-
ous Olympics in Canada. At both the 1976 Sum-
mer Montreal Olympics and the 1988 Calgary
Winter Olympics, Canada failed to win a single
gold medal. The country has never been the
medal leader at any Olympics in history. '

In actuality, this year’s Games has been an
American-dominated Olympics. We have the
star powerin Lindsey Vonn, Shaun White, Shani
Davis and Apollo,Anton Ohno. We’re leading

' the ﬁeld in medals — and, apparently, mak-

ing Canada feel more inferior than it thought

possible. I

. “If we knew what they were doing, we’cl be
doing it too,” said Michael Chambers — the
presidentof the Canadian Olympic Committee
— to the Toronto Sun this week. “The US. is
having a tremendous Games. They are making
it very tough for us. I’m very impressed by what
I’ve seen from their team.”

Although everyone in Vancouver would
like to have you forget, Kumaritashvili — the
unknown athlete, ﬁ'om a small nation, who hap-
pened to die — might very well be the enduring
image of these Olympics. His death serves as a
microcosm for the games as a whole.

The luge course that claimed Kurnaritash-
vili’s life was built in haste, and the “Own the
Podium” campaign was advertised brazenly.
The track has since been altered with the ad-
dition of a new wall and padding at the fatal
mm — alterations that could have, and should
have, been made long before the course was

ever raced. “Own the Podium” was put to rest -

witha hush and whisper.
Perhaps this is idealistic thinking, but some-

‘ thing tells me that both tragic failures should I

have been foreseen - and, since theyweren’t,
these Olympics will very likely peter out with a
heavy dose of shame for O’Canada. —

“Overall, I was pleased with the perfor-
mance of the entire team,” Aprile said. “Ste-
vens got off to a very solid start, as did Ashley
Amistade and Megan Livesey.” ,

Amistade ﬁnished the tournament with
six hits while Livesey scored two runs for the
Panthers overthe ﬁve games. V

The Panthers’ third loss came in an extra-
inning contest against Maryland, as Pittfell 4-3
in the eighth inning.

Maryland took an early 2-0 lead in the ﬁrst

Pitt looks to build on strengths  

 but the Panthers tied the game in the
bottom of the seventh as Kristen Cheesebrew
connected with a two—run double.

Despite the late rally, Maryland recorded
another two runs at the top of the eighth, while
Pitt only countered with one in the ending half
of the inning. '

Aprile knows that such a loss can impact
a team in a negative way, but she is conﬁdent
that her team will use it as motivation for fu-
ture play.

“An extra—inning loss can be draining, but
we did a lot of very good things in that game
and those were our points of emphasis in the
post—game analysis,” Aprile said. “There is a

lot to be learned from losing, and the key is to ,_

keep getting better and that is what we focus
on in our preparation.”

The Panthers will return to the ﬁeld on
Saturday when they enter the North Carolina
Invitational, taking on Fairﬁeld in their ﬁrst
game.
