dominated by his own men. .

Mr. Coleman ‘appealed to the audi-
dence against voting on sentiment;
not to vote for W'ilson because he is
a college «man, and not to vote for
Rooseveltibecause some one tried to

assassinate him. He said that Taft,“

although :1 poor politician is an ‘hon-

est and quiet judge, who has served‘

the party faithfully.
Mr. Coleman’s last point was that

Areligiousfanaticism should ngt enter

into the matter because the constitu-
tion of the United States requires no
religious test, and the freedom of con-
scignce is the birthright of every cit-
Mr. Coleman’s main thought
throughout the speech was to lay

'" aside, all individuals and to vote for

the principle in “Which you ‘believe.
He said the main idea is to build up
and not to tear down the preseiit
foundations.

~. A A GOOD ‘PROPOSITION

How many students in the Uni-
versity, if .they needed something
that cost seven dollars and were of-
fered thesame at five dollars would
turn the proposition down. It is safe
to say that very few would fail to
take advantage of the bargain that
was given to them. And yet there
are mahy students at the present time
that are refusing to take advantage of
just such an offer. It may be that
they do not realize the fact that they
are refusing one of the best bargains
that has ever been given to the stu-
dents.

Five dollars buys one of the stu-
dent activity books. By purchasing
one of these books the student is en-
titled to :i subscription to the Pitt
Weekly, two tickets for the Cap and
_Gown performance, two tickets to the
home concert of the Glee Club, and
bne copy of the Junior Owl. The
total value of the privileges to which
the book entitles a person is seven

dollars, and by purchasing’ the book

you save two dollars on your invest-
ment. The -book was planned with
the sole intention of giving the stu-
dents a chance to obtain the various
privileges_ that the book offers at a
reduced price. The only person that
is beneﬁted by the purchase of the
book is t'he party that buys‘ it. Every

_ organihation that is represented in

the book agreedvto reduce their regu-
lar price in order that the students
could be offered this bargain.

If you have not yet purchased a
book, buy one at once. If you are a
loyal student you will takein all the
things that are mentioned in the book,
and you might as well save two‘ dol-
lars when the opportunity is given.’

GOOD SPORTS

Members of the student body that
made the trip to the Navy with. the
football team last Saturday are loud
‘in their praises of the treatment that
they were accolﬁed. Each man came

home with some story of the good ‘

time that he had enloyed and the
royal treatment that he had received.
The game was clean, and every good
play, whether made by the team Of
the vis-tors, was ‘applauded. The
splendid sportsmanship that was dis-
played by the Navy team will not
soon be forgotten, and Pitt men will
ever have a warm spot in their hearts
for the Navy team and their fol-
lowers.

FRESHMEN FOOTBALL

' Practice for the freshman fodtball
team has been going on for SeV€1‘a1
weeks, under the direction of Coach
Chatham, one of Pitt’s old football
men, and a man that knows consid-
erable about the gridiron gamﬁu 50
far the work of developing a good
team has been handicapped, but by the
fact that th-ere are no-t -enough of -the
freshmen going out to try for posi-
tions on the team, and those mem-
bers of the class that are not able to
play football are not out at the ﬁeld
giving their classmates "the support
that they deserve. Every member of
the class of 1916 that is able to play

any football at all ought to be out

trying for a position on the team or
ou-ghtito go out and cheer the men
that are trying for positions, at the
daily practice. ,

The success of t.hed’Varsity, football
team depends to a great exten-t- on the
success of the freshmen teams. The
men that are unable to play this year
will perhaps be the Stars on the
‘Varsity of next year. Get out and
helpﬂyour team, freshmen.

 

HOW ABOUT A DAY OFF?

There seems to bp a feeling among
the _students ofnthe University that
they should be given a day" oﬁ‘ next
Tuesday, on account of the fact that
that day is.election/_day. The Weekly
heartily supports this desire on the
part of the students. Many of the
students will not be at school wheth-
ier there is school or whether there is
not, so why not give every person a‘
(lay off? Many of the schools and
universities of the country do not
have school on election day, so that
if the faculty declare that there will
be no school next Tuesday, they will
will not be doing ‘anything that will
be a radical departure from custom.

MEDICAL NOTES.

Dean Arbuthnot attended a dinner
at the home of Dr. J. M. _,Baldy,
President: of the Pennsylvania Bureau
of Medical Education and Licensery,
last Thursday evening. Following this
there was a meeting in the interest of
closer afﬁliations, "and ibetter work
amongthe medical schools of the
state. ’ Dr. Arbuthnot represented the
University of Pittsburgh.‘ Deans of
various other medical schools were
present.

The‘ School ' of Medicine A made ar-
rangements to . vaccinate free of
charge on three days of last week all
students who wished it. Considerable
expense was gone to in. the matter of

"drugs, and three extra doctors were

employed: -but no. students appeared.
The medical faculty were disgusted
at this "poor response, and hope that
in the future such opportunities will
be better used. *

The new medicalilibrary was

opened October 30 in a room set"

apart for the purpose on the first
ﬂoor of the Medical building. There
is a librarian in charge and the room
contains tables seating 30 or 40 stu-
dents». There are approximately 500
medical books in the library, and
about 25 of _the leading medical pub-
lic.ations and periodicals are received
regularly.

Mr. Poole, the private secretary of

Dean Arbuthnot, has been nominated

by the medical students for the Dis-
patch prize auto contest, and they are
all working for him to win. The sup-
port of anybody who is willing to

‘help is solicited.

ANNOUNCEMENTS.

Though not deﬁnitely decided,.it is

tentatively announced that at the
College Assembly next Wednesday
morning Dr. Frederick S. Webster,

servation of Our Native Birds.” This
willabe a rare treat, and the college

Among other topics, she told of. the ‘

religious life of the students; that
there are about 12- out of-> every uni-
versity"? who have any religion at all.

Miss Robinson met the girls at a _

tea given Tuesday in her honor in
the chapel of the University.

more than usual merit. This event
being one bf the leading musicals of
the school year, plans are being com-
pleted for this big. concert. As is
known. State will bé here with one of
the best clubs in years, their men be-
ing pickedfrom 150 candidates to
make this trip. The usual dance and
reception for the State clubmen will
follow in the Schenley ball room,
dancing being continued until 2
o’clock. ' I

In as much as this is an important
event’ in musical lines, it should be
supported by the students of the Uni-
versity, by alumni, professors and the
many friends of the institution. It is
only‘ ﬁtting and proper that every stu-
dent and alumnusshould count on at-
tending this even as he does the an-
nual football game. For in reality it
is another contest for supremacy, not
on the gridiron, however, between
these schools, but on the concert
stage. And as such it should receive
the loyal support of Pitt adherents.
State promises to be there strong this
year with its alumni, and it is hoped
Pitt will not fall short in their en-
deavors-

Already a large number of students
have been inquiring as to this concert
and dance, many ‘of them having -by
this time made arrangements to at-
tend this important social function.
Within a short time tickets will be
placed on sale for the concert and
dance, members. of the clubs selling
as well as others who wish togassist.

Beginning next week both Mando-
lin and Glee Clubs will have two re-
hearsals each week, at least until
Thanksgiving Day‘, so that the num-
bers will be thoroughly mastered by
each vocalist and instrumentalist. The
directors of each club are reporting
the best of progress with their respec-
tiveimen. A I

Membermdesiriiig to take part in
this concert must report next

‘Wednesday on time and..to each as-

signed rehearsal thereafter. This de-
cree is to be enforced by elimination,
if necessary, by the directors.

pared, since the Xmas trip, eginning

mainder of Season With Injured
K_nee —-~ Midshipmen Are Splendid
Hosts. 0 '

Pitt lost her third straight gam-e at
the hands of. Uncle Sam’s naval. as-
pirants last Saturday at ’ Annapolis

and in the same game lost the serv-

' ices of “Dutch” I-lockensmith for the

remainder of the'season. On account
of Captain Galvin’s injury in the In-
dian game, Coac‘h Thompson shifted

the big tackle‘ to center where he’ did

, splendid work in practice and was ex-
" pected to get back into his own posi-

tioii later in the season. In the ﬁrst
ﬁve minutes of play in the Navy game
Hockensmith was injured and had to
retire'to the side lines and a thor-
bugh examination by Dr. Goldsmit'h,
the team physician, proved that his
right knee was dislocated which will
undoubtedly keep him out of football

‘ for the remainder of the season. This

latest loss will proved a sad blow to
the Varsity as the Kiski boy had been
the “ﬁnd” of the season. John Blair
was substituted for him in the ﬁrst
quarter and though it was his ﬁrst
at the keystone position, he did ex-
ceptionally well and will be kept
there till Capt. “Polly” is able to re-

_ claim his place, when _Blair will be

shifted to tackle. _.

The game showed ragged spots in
both teams, but was exceptionally
clean, and the 3,000 spectators seemed
it. Had
Capt.-Galvin been in the game or had
Hockensmith been able to remain, the
result would have been very different
as the Pitt players seemed confused
at times, and did not play the game
theyididl against the Indians on-the
previous. Saturday. The best feature
of the contest was the fact that the

~ Pitt players did not give up, but ﬁn-

ished strongerthan their opponents.

\/Vagner was acting captain and

THE   PITT WEE

WASH. & JEFF AND.PENN_
STATE ARE GOING STRONG

The recent games played by W. &
J. and Penn State have showed be-
yond a doubt that these teams are
very_strong and that Pitt will have
‘her hands full next month in these
games. Every one thought that W.
& J. had a large amount‘ of luck in
holding the Indians even early in the
season, but their recent game at Yale
proves this is in part erroneous. as
they held .the strong Bulldog eleven
to 13 points on their own back lot.
In the meantime they secured a ﬁeld
goal. That their overwhelming de-
f-eat at Penn State was a case of
"cold feet” is the opinion of many, as
no one will concede that State is 30
points better t‘han the Red and Black
eleven. «

State is going at the same clip they
established last year. They have
practically the same team that faced
Pitt _‘in 1911 with the exception of
two men. Some of the last'year men
are having trouble in holding their
positions on the varsity which shows
they have a very strong lineup. They
will undoubtedly defeat "Penn by
thirty points or more. State came to
Pittsburgh last year with the idea
that they had a “cinch.” but ’ere the
game was half played they had
changed their ideas considerably, to
such _extent, ‘in fact, that they con-
sumed just ﬁve minutes toward the
latter part of the game in running off
three plays. It was their idea‘ to
keep t‘he ball just as long as possible
and even draw penalties for slowing
up the game in order ‘to keep Pitt
from walking away with the game.
vTl'1ey think at present that they will

. run away with the game this year,

but we will be ready for them by
Thanksgiving.

showed up so strbng at ﬁrst that few
plays were sent towards the center of
the line. Blair did very well and
when the fact that he was put in a
position that he "had not played be-
fore is taken into consideration, his
showing was exceptionally good. Roy
Kernohan was substituted in the last
quarter and did. some very good tack-
ling. He is the best defensive half-
back on the entire squad, and will
probably start. the game against
Notre Dame on Saturday.

The party was very much pleased
with the good treatment shown them
by the Navy management and Mid-
shipmen. When the team appeared
in the dining hall Saturday morning,
the Navy men gave their visitors a
hearty cheer which the Pitt men re-
sponded to by the Varsity handclap.
Before the game started the Navy
rooters again cheered forthe Gold
and"Blue, and _when the game was
over and Pitt left the ﬁeld defeated.
they were again cheered. It is this
sort of sportsmanship that makes a

RED AND BLACK HEARDMFROM
The week following the Pitt-Indian
game found many: articles in“ the
Pittsburgh daily paperslpraising the
Gold and Blue eleven for °ﬁghting the
Indians till the very end of the game
after they were decisively defeated by
the husky Redskin horde. The “Red
and Black,” ofﬁcial mud-sliinger of_
our nearby rivals, VV.  J., went out
of their way to say that the Pitts-
burgh papers were mighty pleased to
ﬁnd that the Pitt team hadn’t showed,
yellow against the Aborigines as they
had evidently expected it.
to agree with the Red and Black to
a certain extent in that we.suppose
the papers were pleased to see that
Pitt didn’t show up yellow, as W. &
J. -did against State the same day.

 

BowL1NG OUTLOO_K

The suggestion made last week by
the Dental College “Booster” in re-
gard to the formatioir of a bowling
league is a good one. VVhy sl1ouldn’tl
bowling be introduced in the sport-
ing curriculum of the University? It.
is a clean and wholesome sport and
would no doubt prove to have a large
number of followers if a league were
started. Take the initiative. “dents,”

schools will fall into line.
