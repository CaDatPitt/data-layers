Choice rally brings Pitt pro-life to action

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer S

Joel Gary, president of Students for Life,
wasn’t impressed by the estimated 150,000
people marching in Washington, D.C. at
Sunday’s pro-choice rally.

“They think that they had a lot of people
there on Sunday. Wait ‘til they see our stuff
in January,” Gary said.

Organizing people to attend national pro-
life rallies that are planned for January and
April is one of the main projects that Students
for Life is dedicating itself to. The group held
this year’s first meeting on Monday.

“This is not a new group. It has been in
existence for years, but it was just in
hibernation for a while, and we decided to
bring it back,” Gary said.

Although there were only 14 people in
attendance at Monday’s meeting, eight of
them male, Gary is confident that many more
people will soon become involved.

“We planned this meeting at the last minute.
Every group has to start somewhere, and we
are an official student group funded by the
student government,” Gary said.

Gary said that the pro-choice rally was
filled with misinformation and

misconceptions.

“I watched the coverage of the rally very
closely, and I was disgusted. Molly Yard
stood up there and said ‘There are 300,000
people here and more coming,”’ Gary said.
“Today we hear that the crowd was at 150,000.
These are the games that these types of
people play. .

“I’m not surprised that many negative things
were said at the rally about President George
Bush. During the 1988 elections, when they
asked the people voting which issue was
most important to them, it was the abortion
issue. Why was Bush elected? Because this
country is pro—life.”

Gary said that the idea of choice is twisted
by the pro-choice supporters.

“Women do have a choice. They have the
choice to not get pregnant,” he said.

According to Gary, the SFL will plan a
celebration if Governor Casey signs a bill
limiting abortions. I

“Our state is the most pro—life state, I'm
happy to report. We are going to win here.
We have a pro—life governor who will most
definitely support all legislation limiting
abortions,” Gary said.

One of the first projects the group is
starting is a campaign to raise money for the

Genesis House in Bellevue.

“This is a place where young, unwed
mothers can bring to term their babies,” Gary
said. '

The Genesis House was founded in 1975 as
a telephone counseling service and has since
expanded to include services for unwed
mothers.

“We think it’s very important to let the
people at Genesis know that their decision —
the right decision to give birth to the child —
is one that we wholeheartedly support,” said
Stacee Bearfoot, vice president of SFL.

Bearfoot said that SFL is planning to have
a booth in the William Pitt Union to collect
money and also may take a group trip to
Genesis to volunteer.

“This is a great way to show people that we
care,” Bearfoot said.

Gary said that the group’s central concern
is to educate people on campus so that they
can hear the voice of reason on the abortion
issue.

“Our primary concern is to educate. We
don’tofﬁcially support destruction ofpropeny.
We think it is wrong, but there are reasons
why this is done,” Gary said.

The Pitt Program Council
brought rock ‘n’ roll to Pitt this
week with Rolling Stone.- The
Photographs, an exhibit featuring
over 20 years of classic
photojournalism.

Over 50- pictures made up the
show with pieces from Rolling,
St0ne’s most famous
photographers, including Richard
Avedon, Annie Liebovitz and
Herb Ritts.

An introduction to the exhibit
said, “More than just a magazine,
Rolling Stone has used
photojournalism playfully and
daringly to document popular
American culture; The result: this
definitive collection.”

The photographs in the exhibit
were unique, showing celebrities
in unusual poses: Marlon Brando

a wheat ﬁeld; Penn and Teller
handcuffed together and hanging
from a wall; Madonna in bed
with Mickey Mouse ears on.
“It was a good representation a

just be musicians, but there were
shots of actors and other people
in the entertainmentworld, and it
even covered what was going on
in the outside world,” said Pitt
junior Robyn Smigel.

According to Martha Moranz,
PPC’s art committee chairwoman,
the photo exhibit, which ran from
Sunday to Tuesday, received a
large and enthusiastic response.

“I wasn't sure about what the
turnout would be, but it seemed
to catch on, and we’ve had a

 

large amount of people here.”

The exhibit is a promotional
tour, sponsored by both Rolling
Stoneand Maxwell House coffee.
According to Moranz, only 25
campuses in the country will
feature this show, so “it’s a big
honor to have it» here.”

“I never saw anything like it in
my life,” said Pitt junior Michael
Zorich. “I’d like to see more things
like this at Pitt." -

However, Moranz said that
unless other shows are also

sponsored by outside companies,

    
 

there won’t be many more
exhibits like the Rolling Stone
show at Pitt.

“It would cost a lot of money
to have another show like this,
unless it’s also a promotional
tour. It’s always hard to decide
what to spend for which events,
and art shows usually aren’t a big
draw on campus.” .

However, the Rolling Stone
exhibit “was a big show, and a lot
of people thought it. was great,”
said Moranz. _ j

“I thought the photos were

“The women involved in the

Petrovich accused the
Pittsburgh police of aggravating
the situation by mistreating the

“The Pittsburgh police have a

They made the situation worse

whole incident out of proportion, ”
Petrovich said.

“The abortion issue isn’t a

Supreme Court allows prof to market Arzz‘z'—]I/Iorzopoly game I

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
For the Pitt News

Monopoly is a game that
everyone has been playing for
years. But Ralph Anspach, an
economics professor at San
Francisco State University, has
invented a game that takes the
concept of Monopoly one step
further — Anti-Monopoly.

Professor Anspach’s intentions
were not to have a game that
would cause controversy or
discovery. Anspach just wanted
to have a game that would teach
people economic concepts and
effects that monopolies have on
a capitalist society. .

“I was at dinner one night,” he
said, “complaining to my family
about the formation of OPEC. I
was ranting and raving about the
monopoly that was forming.
There were going to be long
lines for gas, and higher prices.
My eight—year—old son asked me
why I was so upset. He told me
that there was nothing wrong
with monopolies. Then I realized
that he had beaten me at the
board game the night before.”

Anspach then decided that
something should be done to
teach people that monopolies
were not good, but were actually
harmful to a capitalist society.

Anspach invented a game and »

marketed it. The game, entitled

“Anti-Monopoly," sold well. He '

was convinced that he had a

game thatwouldteach others the Q §_£R°5’é 4 A
::tli(;rSnonopolist view that he 3;‘ I 62%;: $ 2 5  
The company that owns the g d > 5 4 ‘
patent to Monopoly had other ‘/4’ V?    & F
ideas. General Mills, the company ’6‘R~;mo‘*" ._

who owned Parker Brothers at
the time, took Anspach to court
on the grounds that “Anti—
Monopoly” infringed on the
Monopoly trademark.

“The truth was that I was
creating a game to teach others

about anti-monopolies, ” Anspach
said recently during a stop in
Pittsburgh to promote the game.

By April 1977, Anti—Monopoly

_ had successfully sold about half

ofa million games. But in July of
the same‘ year, General Mills had
triumphed. Forty thousand Anti—
Monopoly games were turned
over to General Mills. General
Mills then dumped ‘the Anti—
Monopoly games in a landfill in
Mankato, Minnesota. Parker
Brothers thought that they had
seen the last of Anspach.
Anspach, however, is a
crusader, and he kept on ﬁghtin g.

He appealed the case, and won
at the appellate level. Then an

I’

appearance on a talk show led to
an interesting piece of

information. ‘

“A lady called the show and
told me that Parker Brothers really
didn’t create Monopoly. Some
Quakers near Philadelphia

invented the game,” he said.

This lead Anspach to start
researching Monopoly». He

J discovered that Charles Darrow

had not invented the game during
the Great Depression, as Parker
Brothers had claimed. Anspach
discovered that the game had
been invented 30 years earlier by
some Quaker women.

Anspach said, “Quakers were
the ones who invented the fixed

prices. They believed that a fair

price system was important. That 7
g is whythe prices appear on the

board.”

Anspach discovered that the
game was played in
Philadelphia area. It originated
as a type oflandlord’s game. The
different colored spaces were
names of Philadelphia streets.’
The game eventually evolved into
a homemade game that Darrow

had copied. '
“I looked into old yearbooks at

Haverford College. Some students
were listed as being compulsive

PPC reveals MTV costs

“Remote Control” has proven to be a very costly

I diversion for Pitt students.
- ‘According to Hugh Harkiewicz, chairman of ‘concert
and entertainment for the Pitt Program Council, the total
cost incurred to bring Ken Ober and his cast of wacky co-

0 hosts to the University of Pittsburgh was approximately
$20,000. The PPC was able -to recover about $5,000 from

. the priceof the tickets and the like. Thus, the net cost was
somewhere in the neighborhood of $15,000 which came
_ directly from the student activities fee.

These figures are slightly out of sync with the total Cost ’
of approximately'$2S,000 and recovery of about $8,500
- quoted by student coordinator Melinda Holben. How-
ever, these slight discrepancies are irrelevant. Either way,

the__price paidwas a hefty one. _

This would not be _a problem if it were worth this
amount of money. However, only a small portion of the
students who paid for this entertainment were actually
able to attend. The Carnegie Music Hall, where the event
took place, holds under 2,000 people at full capacity; and

 

the “Remote Control” show was not a sellout.

Granted, the PPC is not a group of mind readers, and’
it can only guess as to what activities the students would
enjoy, however, it would seem to make good business

» sense to be a little more frugal with the students’ money.

The PPC’s reluctance" to“ release the figures seems to
suggest that even it considered the cost of this particular

program to be a bit too high. ' .

~, In fairness, the PPC has brought many activities in the

j past that were very enjoyable and at a much lower price.

7 To name but afew examples, when Steel Pulse played

l_ast year on Flagstaff Hill, the cost was considerably less

than $15,000, and Flagstaff seats an unlimited amountof
people. Currently, the Rolling Stoneexhibit in the Assem-
_ 5 vbly Room, which is being co-sponsored by radio station
A ‘ -WDVE, isan event that can be enjoyed by any interested -

__ student, and that cost a relatively small amount.
The bottom line_is this: shows such as “Remote Control”-

and “Morton Downey Jr.” are just not worth the high -
7 price tags that accompany them.~In the future, it is our

hope that the PPC will avoid such inflated entertainment,

 _ but continue to bring the many quality, less expensive
j - shows that it has in the past.

  fWay to go, Todd!

” Todd placed third in a national competition held by the

This is the second year that Todd has entertained our readers
- with the off-the-wall antics and bulging eyes (one of which is

is -well—deserved. P _
Once again, congratulations Todd ‘on a job very well-done!

Dear Sparrow Lady,
Your relationship to this writer

is as impersonal.— or personal if

— as the thousands you reach
every week. '

You are a person of the streets.
Unlike many others who find
their livelihood on the streets,
you do not ask others for their
money or pity. It doesn’t appear
as though you are there because
of unfortunate economic circum-
stance, but out of choice and
commitment. You are aggressive
and always eager to express your
convictions. ‘ _

Your gambit isn’t “I could use
a quarter,” but instead, “Get in-5
going to
bu rn!” ‘My, how you are different.
For many, your so—called street
ministrywould be regarded as
just another spoken manifesta-
tion of a “bona—ﬁde nut.” To

' those here in Pittsburgh how-

ever, your words and your pres-
ence are A hauntingly familiar.

There isn’t a person in this city ‘

who has lived here for any length

1 of time who _doesn’t know of

you-. Most of us have encoun-
tered, you a dozen times, if not
more. You seem to be every-
where. P

How did you come to achieve
a multi—year extension of your
Andy Worholian “Fifteen Min-
utes?” Pittsburgh may not be the
megapolis of New York City _—

nor the sprawling mass of con— .

centrated men that Los Angeles is
-— but it is certainly big enough
that most people don't know one
another. For only a pittance spent

' ‘on bus fare, it is just shy of

amazing how you have come to

your phenomenon of “popular-

every day. ' ‘

Literally speaking, your proph-
ecy may be considered a false
one. “Three days" have passed
600 times since my first encoun-
ter with your warning. On the
other hand, you are quite accu-
rate in your point of view. The
world my grandparents knew did
end. The world continually ends

for people and institutions, only
-to be renewed again in a differ-
ent form. Your ministry is on
target, but perhaps fails to real-
ize the life-affirming rejuvena-
tion in destruction and renewal;

opinion that society avoids — or
even scorns —- eccentric people
because they mirror ourselves, as

we would appear,if unrestrained '

by outside and personal forces. It
isn’t out of the question, there-
fore, that you have come to re-
flect our society’s preoccupation
with “The End of the World.” A

Think of the way we rally to‘

save the environment, for ex-
ample. We act as though it will
disappear tomorrow, forgetting
that it has been threatened since
man created tools to aid in his
avarice and selfishness. Abortion
has become a dominating issue

' and practice in America. Perhaps

abortion is an ending of the world
for those awaiting its initiation —
or a reaction to our perceived
societal apocalypse. We cry out
about AIDS, forgetting that our
grandparents’ generation re-
garded the flu as potentially. le-
thal. We live in a world where a
phone call could lead to the
decimation of our planet and

expedite a genocide that once

would. have required a more
laborious effort.

Ours has never been a world
immune from destruction, but it
seems as though we are con-
sumed with -an urgent concern
over our mortality, now more

than ever. We grow more anx-
pious about the end of the world,

 

in endings and beginnings.
Aside from the thought—pro—
voking psychological and socio-
logical implications of your pres-
ence, this writer would like to

propose a very human observa- '

tion. We live in an age where

I most people are afraid to rally

without each other. You, on the
other hand, stand alone. Your
convictions aren’t echoed in the

‘tirades of an organized zealous

demagogue, but seem to emerge

‘from the annals of your heart.

You preach not in Washington,

D.C. with a mass of alienated ‘

people — but by yourself. My,
how you are courageous.
Beneath the recognition, there

lies a deep bond between you 2

and the city of Pittsburgh.‘ You,
Sparrow Lady, have captured our

modern fear and forced us to‘

confront it daily. You have proven
an -individual’s capacity to dis-
play the courage to speak out —
and be heard for it. You deserve
as much respect as anyone who
chooses to peacefully persuade
others. You aren’t a threat—— you

only threaten to expose our se— _
cret psyches.

Indeed, Sparrow Lady, you pos-

sess a bird's-eye view-. It is up to '

us not to ﬂy away from your
challenge of anagnorisis.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 15, ‘ - ‘V

 

T he fall of the Berlin wall does not mean the end of the Cold W/ar...

It’s probably fair to say that
nearly everyone in the United
States is happy for the East
, German people over the recent
decision by their new leader,
Egon Krenz, to lift East German
travel restrictions. Of course, the
happiness is justified, but what
does this historic move mean?

What it doesn’t necessarily
mean is that (1) East Germany is
on a road to Jeffersonian de-
mocracy (2) they have joined
Hungary and‘Poland in repudi-
ating the Communist doctrine
(3) the US should start cutting its
military budget and begin a
dismantling of NATO and (4) it
doesn’t signify the end of the
Cold War.

What it does mean is that
Krenz realizes that if East Ger-
many doesn’t start lifting travel
restrictions and permitting its
people more freedom to‘ cross
borders, then there wont be
any people left in East-Ger-

many. A situation like that
wouldn’t exactly help the coun-
try’s national production.

Also, before we start compar-
ing Egon Krenz to Martin Luther,
it would be wise to keep in mind
that on a recent trip to China, this
new East German leader compli-
mented the Chinese leadership
for its massacre of students in
Tiananmen Square. Additionally,
on Nov. 1, Krenz stated, “I think
it is unfair, without knowing the

‘substance of my work, to say

that I am a hard—liner. I am a
Communist, and a Communist
works so that things in our coun-
try move forward. That means
change.”

“Change” in East Germany
doesn’t mean a switch to capital-
ism or democracy, but a switch to
satisfy the masses’ obvious desire
for that bit of needed freedom
which is essential to all humans.
This includes allowing them‘ to

cross borders like normal human

beings, and to open a few holes

’ in the wall that has caged them in

like animals for 28 years.
Furthermore —— being that East
Germany has been, according to
many economists, the only coun-
try to make communism “half—
work” economically — there is
no reason why Krenz and the

current East German Communist
leadership would seek demo-
cratic-type economic reforms.
Paradoxically, with a couple
more months of the continuing
exodus that has occurred at the
rate of tens of thousands of
immigrants per weekend, the only
people that would be left in East

...or even that East and West Germany

Recently, everybody from Joe
Schmoe to Jimmy Carter has been
criticizing my good friend George
because he has failed to warmly
acknowledge the chain reaction-
of historic events spreading
across the Communist Bloc. For

once, I have to agree with them. -

Bush is blowing it.

‘ But he stands to make an even
larger mistake if he follows the
lead of so many other ignorant
world leaders by pushing for an
immediate reunion between the
estranged nations of East and
West Germany. Similarly, thou-

sands of people have been giv-
ing East German Communist

‘Party leader and premier-to—be
Egon Krenz and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl a.hard
time because they have said in
no uncertain terms that reuniﬁ-
cation talks ‘between their two-
countries are out of the question.
All other world leaders are con-
vinced that making Germany a

Last week I experienced a
weekend which has caused me
to consider my‘ length of stay at
the University of Pittsburgh. You
see I went to Penn State.

Last year when scouting out
colleges, I narrowed my choices
down between Pitt and PS_U and
after visiting both schools, de-
cided Pitt was deﬁnitely for me.
However that was the Pitt of
yesterday, a far cry from today’s
version.

In this past year the Pitt IFC
along with the LCB and the uni-
versity have drawn up a list of
ruleswhich has certainly caused
a downfall in the fraternities and
indirectly with the “partying”
aspect of Pitt.

When I considered writing this »

letter I felt quite immature, after
all “You go to school to learn.”
Right? WRONG! [...] Sorry to play
the stereotypical beer guzzling
greek but fraternity parties go
hand in hand with beer which
goes hand in hand with fun -
and do not turn around and throw
that line back in my face. Yes, I

can have fun withoutalcohol, ,

singular entity is the next logical
step in Communist reform. They
think it can and should be done
easily.

They are wrong. Nothing
that simple. I

The newly-found freedom of
travel between the Germanies is
not, as is commonly believed by
the American populace and other
democracy-oriented peoples, a
symbol of the crumbling of
communism and the rising vic-
tory of democracy. This interpre-
tation is narrow-minded and
dangerous. By championing one

lifestyle over another, we are
guilty of egotism. It is this same

“master race” mentality that got

is

_ Germany into so much trouble in

the first place. America has al-
ready seen the signs of its own
attitude problem e from McCar-
thyism to imperialism. We must
be wary of falling victim to these
trends once again.

The string of political upheaval

but step ‘back and take a look at
my point. i i

PSU, ‘however, has no such
ridiculous rules governing frater-
nity parties (nor do the other
thousands of schools in this
country). I attended seven frater-
nity parties in two nights and was
witness to no ﬁghts, drunk driv-
ing accidents, or destruction to
any local property.[...l, _

The IFC and Pitt must come
together and loosen up some of
the overly demanding rules
placed on fraternity parties. No, I
am not suggesting the university
should give authoritative approval
to under-age drinking, ‘but in a
university as large and growing
as this one, the fall of Greek life
and “party” life in general can not
be afforded.

‘When I visited Pitt last year I
was shown a fun time, part of this
fun time was fraternity parties 
Now it’s my turnto show visitors
my great school —— academically
I see no problem, but for fun?...
I’m not really sure!

, Jason  Coren .
.‘ CA5 ’93

in the Eastern Bloc has undenia-
bly shownia change in Commu-
nist foreign policy. They are not
in a state of decline. In fact, the
newfound freedom that previ-
ously oppressed citizens have
experienced will only strengthen
public support for their govern-
ments. Communism will begin
to ﬂourish, since ‘it will not be so

 

 

radically antagonized by reform-
ers. 4 A

This is as it should be. Com-
munism is not wrong; it’s just
different. It was the oppression
and corruption that was wrong.

' In short, it was the way it was

administered thatwas faulty, not

Chautauqua at Pitt ignores pro-
life ’ ,
Claiming that “Chautauqua at
Pitt will add a new dimension
and enhance understanding and

 

good will between our peoples”
the designers of this “landmark
conference” between American

and Russian citizens proceeded

to sabotage those goals by allow-
ing only liberal, pro-abortion,
radical—feminists to represent our
society at sessions and work-
shops on women’s family and
reproductive issues. I
With all.the outstanding, suc-
cessful, pro—life women in Amer-
ica, it is tragic that a one-sided,
distorted view of American
women should be portrayed to
the Russians and to the world by
the pro-abortion, political fail-
ure, Geraldine Ferraro and the

‘radical-feminist, Marlo Thomas.
The Russians cannotbe expected __

Germany would be Communists.
Chances are rather high that these
Communist faithfuls would be-
come quite disgruntled with their
governmental system, as they

would continue to pick up the _

load around the work place for
their hundreds of co—workers who
have fled the country. Krenz isn’t
stupid; he’s quite aware of the
fact that‘ no economy, can work
without people or workers.

Ironically, the Berlin Wall, a
wall originally intended to keep
East Germans in East Germany,
has worked to push and keep
them out. Again, Krenz realizes
that sometimes giving a little
freedom is absolutely necessary
in keeping the people in.

Of course, the emotional yo-
yos of the American media are
now kicking around the “pleas-
ant” possibility» of a reunified
Germany. That thought should
lead to a feeling of ambivalence;
it sounds nice, but perhaps it

should unite

system of government in which
this is not the case 4-1 dare you.
Mr. Gorbachev has my highest
respect. So do Mr. Krenz and Mr.
Mladenov, if the reports of the
latter’s role in the removal of
Zhivkov are true. It is through the
cooperation of these open-
minded men that communism’
will achieve the respect it de-
serves. Their accomplishments
are continually tearing down the
ill will and resentment left over
from the Cold War, as surely as’
the Berlin ‘Wall A itself comes
tumbling down. I applaud their
actions and encourage further
effort. The Communists are
making great strides toward peace
and global togetherness. We have
to match their efforts before we
appear uncooperative.
As for George, I have a sugges-

tion: get with the program. First ,

of all, recognize the successes of
the Communists and thank them
for their work, Next, encourage

to understand American women
and families when a major seg-

ment of our society is excluded ‘

and pro-life women are ignored.

' Gottfried key to Pitt’s losses

This letter is in response to ‘.‘Pitt
football in need of fresh, new
leadership,” by Thomas Danyluk.
l...] —

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
is dedicated to playing the best
his team can play, and may I add,
we field a Top 10 team. Then
why is it that Pitt is unable to beat
any better-than-average teams
other than State? Here are three
reasons: I

1. Gottfried does not get the
most out of his-talent. The foot-
ball players seem unmotivated,_
apparently,‘using Pitt as only a
stepping stone to the pros.‘
Gottfried’s job is to have the team
mentally prepared, and this year,
Syracuse was the only game we
were mentally prepared for. This
is not new. In the four years he
has been here, the teamhas been

isn’t. Do we really want to see the
reunification ofthe same country
that was the aggressor in WW1

and WWII? A country whose:

people, only 50 years ago,
pledged and fought for a Third
Reich whose goal was a German -
empire that would last for a thou-
sand years? _

Yet a few simple facts are quite
certain and should not be made
complicated (although they al-

ready appear to be beyond the s

giddy media’s comprehension).
The Berlin Wall has been the
most visually symbolic represen-
tation of the Cold War. But~let’s

interpret its historicand partial .r

dismantling for what it really is: a
way to prevent East Germany
from an inevitable future as a
Communist ghost—town — not

"necessarily the end of the Cold

War. Appearances can be de-
ceiving. '

Paul Kengor is a columnist for - I

The Pitt News.

once again

them instead of discouraging"
them. Don 7 push for a reunion of .

East and West Germany. Ifit is to
be, they will do it in their own
time. - . I ,
First, they have to learn to live
together. Their cultures are too

-different. If they are thrown to- .

gether before they are ready,
disaster may occur. lt’s better for
them to test the waters first, and
from there work toward unity.
Finally, start making some
changes here. We’re ‘not ready

for the Communists yet, either.

Don’t screw this up, George. You
‘may even save the 1992 election
over this.

It’s time to forget the mistakes
of the past. lt’s time to drop the
macho “America and Democracy
Rule!” image. It’s time to come
together and be friends.

Jim Wecbslerlis a columnist for
The Pitt News.

nothing but sloppy. [...]
I 2. Gottfried’s game plans are
fooling no one. When there are

equally matched athletes on the . 

field, (i.e. Notre Dame and Mi-

ami) it is the coach that wins or ,‘

loses the game. Pitt has too m_uch
talent to lose every big’ game. At

this level, anyloss hurts, and with . in

Gottfried’s game plans, we are
going to keep losing, and losing,
and losing. _ '
3. Gottfried is dedicated to play-
ing our best no matter what’ the

final score is; The_Pitt student

body wants a coach dedicated to
nothing but winning. [...] No ex-
cuses! No Notre Dame and Miami

are on a different level! We need 7
a coach that makes us the system. ‘_

that‘ everyone considers on‘ a v _
higher level. There was a time  ,
‘like that at Pitt, and we, the‘?!

student body, want that time
again. Gottfried, despite being an
excellent recruiter, is not the
coach to take us to that level,
unless he becomes dedicated to
winning and that alone.

added.

In 1982, the Anti—Monopoly
case had reached the Supreme
Court. Anspach was trying to
prove that Monopoly had been
copied. “Marven Gardens was
spelled wrong. One way to prove
plagiarism is to show that one
who plagiarizes has copied
mistakes also.”

Anspach describes his court
experience as a memorable one.
“It was awesome. I had never

Now, here I was, standing in one
of the most powerful decision-
making bodies in our country.

“I had three mortgages on my
house in order to pay legal fees.
The bank was getting ready to
foreclose on my house. It was
very difﬁcult.”

Anspach is currently trying
again with a second version of
Anti—Monopoly. “The game is

The game was reviewed by a

Anspach describes his students ‘
as being “very interested in the

football team, going into its ﬁnal
two games, had to face the fact
that it would not play in a
postseason bowl game even if it

. closed out the season with a pair

of wins._ One year later, Pitt may
not even have to show up at its
final three encounters to receive
a bid to the John Hancock Bowl
in El Paso, Texas, on Dec. 30.

At yesterday’s weekly football
press conference, Pitt athletic
director Dr. Edward Bozik all but
totally conﬁrmed that the Panthers
would be on the road for the
holidays. A ‘

“If we are offered a chance to

play in a bowl, we’re going to.

accept it,” Bozik said. When asked
if the administrators of the John
Hancock Bowl had made a
concrete offer to Pitt,’ Bozik simply
said, -“What everyone’s been
reading in the newspapers is
pretty accurate,” referring to the
much-publicized articles in local
papers claiming that the bowl
coveted Pitt.

“_I think -the“ bowl picture is

' pretty_set',” he added._

The Panthers will likely play
the Southwest Conference runner-
u p, which -will be either Texas
& M . or Arkansas. '

Pitt (S-2-1) is coming off
consecutive losses to two

' powerhouses, Notre Dame and

Miami, and is currently ranked

. 19th by the Associated Press. The

Panthers close out the regular
season with games against East
Carolina this upcoming Saturday,
Penn State on Nov. 25 and Rutgers
in Dublin, Ireland, on Dec. 2.
,Last season, Pitt finished the
season with defeats at the hands
«of North Carolina State and
Syracuse.
The tenacity of head coach
Mike Gottfried’s squad will not
change just because of the

attention to what they did.

I just saw girls passing my view doing

heard a lot of synchronized cheering.

the fourth—year Pitt coach and his

“Your motivation is to come
back and play hard,” Gottfried
said. “Last year, I feel like our
players played well in the‘ final

Cheerleading is

commitment must be made.

“We have to only play

Of course, one month ago,

everyone had visions of Sugar
and Orange Bowls dancing in
their heads over the holidays, but
that talk ended with the losses to
Notre Dame and Miami.

“In order to go to a New Year's
Dayobowl, you have to beat the
best teams in the country,”
Siragusa said._ “Miami and Notre
Dame are top contenders, so
sometimes you just have to think
about what's ahead of you.”

Bozik feels that there is nothing

Pocket Billiards Club on road to AC U] championship

‘,\‘By Jim Lakely
 Staff Writer

Something evil lurks in the
lower level of the William Pitt
' Union. It lures promising young
students away from their studies
and drops QPAs like a wet
football. Yes, the pool room is
“indeed evil, but its magic has
“given birth to some of the best
billiards players in the country.'It
is also the lair of one of the fastest‘
growing organizations at Pitt, the
Panther Pocket Billiards Club

Founded in August of 1988 by
Don Broggi, who received the
«Outstanding Founder of a Student
* Organization Award last year,

the club’s purpose is to continue
the tradition of championship
caliber play that has become the
trademark of Pitt players.

“Some kids play eight to 10
hours a day as I did as a freshman,"
said Broggi, “but soon you must
learn to budget your time.” A
good number of the people who
play there are commuters who
need to kill some time between
classes. Many start out playing
casually but soon become
hooked. “A clique forms of
commuters that don’t ﬁt the mode
of other organizations, which
forms a nice little family that
continues to grow,” Broggi said.

Billiards is one of the most

widely played sports in the world,
which explains the tremendous
growth the club has experienced
over the past year.

The game takes on different
forms. Snooker is popular in
England, 3-Cushion in the Orient
and 8-ball . in Puerto Rico.
“Billiards is growing and changing
from a sleazy game with a bad
element to a social and family-
oriented game. We want people
to study the game — the
mathematics, the angles, the
geometry and the strategies that
make it a great game," said Broggi.
Using the pool room as a
classroom, the club has groomed
some of the nation’s top players.

Pitt has had at least one men’s

five in the nation for the last

seven years. Last year,J.R. Calbert

came within one game’ of the
national 8-ball championship
losing in the ﬁnal game of a 4-4
tie-breaking match.

Pitt begins the tough road back
to a shot at the championship
when the Association of College
Union Intramurals, a national
collegiate tournament, begins on
the morning of Nov. 15. Each
year, this 8-ball tournament is the
focus of the club’s labor. It is a

the club to sponsor the largest

Tentative plans for a festival-

Cheer  

Continued from page 8

The guys’ faces were blood
red, their arms were shaking from
holding these girls up and it
dawned on me that this was
another athletic exhibition taking
place on the sidelines, which
most people take for granted.

Now keep in mind that all of
these cheerleading moves, with

the exception of the random

excitement during a score or
turnover, are in fact synchronized.
While all the fans are screaming
— well at least they were on the
Miami side of the field — the
cheerleaders are trying to talk to
each other to coordinate their
moves so everything will look
perfect.

Also keep in mind that these

people are cheering, albeit with
some breaks, for the duration of
the contest; which took over
three hours. I was getting tired
just thinking about doing what
they do for that length of time.

Cheerleading is almost as
dangerous as fraternity hazing,
as I found out. A few people
were very seriously injured in

human pyramids too high.
Nowadays, pyramids are smaller
than they used to be as a result.
Also, no outrageous stunts are
allowed anymore.

Finally, this activity is governed
by the NCA or NBA or some
group (I can't remember the
letters) to promote safe standards.

So the next time you people go
to a football or basketball game,
take a few minutes-to look away’
from the game, and take a look at
what the Pitt cheerleaders are
actually doing. It may be all rah-
rah hype to a stadium full of
people, but it is really a lot of
work that takes almost as much,
if not as much commitment as a
