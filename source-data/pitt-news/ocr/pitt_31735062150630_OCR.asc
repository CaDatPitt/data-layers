Carlson Reports
Tuberculosis Tests

Must Be Checked

Students who have taken the pre-
liminary tuberculosis detection tests
are expected to return to have the
read, announce Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the Men’s Stu-
dent Health service, and Dr. Au-
leene M. Jamison, director of the
Women‘s Health service.

Unless the test is read by a com-
petent doctor 48 hours after being
given, the examination is of no
value.

Those found with a positive re-
action to the test will be asked to
make appointments for an x-ray
examination at the Fall: clinic.
Others will be asked to return for
another test in which a stronger
serum is used.

The examination will be conclud-
ed next week. The anti-tuberculo-
sis campaign is co-sponsored by the
health services and the Pitt News.

Speaking Monday at the Renwood
High school commencement, Dr.
Nietz will travel to Cameron High
school Tuesday to deliver his sec-
ond address. He will speak Wed-
nesday to the graduating class of
Sherrard High school.

pie vwho merely pile glasses into
each other until they have a high
stack, puff out their cheeks, and
blow;

The ash-tray-spinners’ tricks are
more limited. They usually just

hold contests among themselves.
They get up teams and see who can
spin an ash tray on the slippery
table longest without its falling on
the floor.

But the coke-glass-piler-uppers :
and the ash-tray-spinners all have ’

one thing in common.

Both sooner or later break what-
ever they are playing with.

They break from 10 to 20 coke
glasses a day, and they thin out the
ranks of ash-trays at the rate of
about three dozen a week.

All this exertion naturally makes
cafe society hungry. And do they
eat!

Pitt people polish off about 50
fresh strawberry pies a day, and
wash them down with about 800
cokes a day. Which is heavy drink-
ing in any university!

You can't live on coke and pie,
so there are always sandwiches.
The Tuck Shop is the kind of heav-
en sandwich manufacturers dream
of going to when they die. About
410 ham salad sandwiches disappear
down there each day. And during
the noon rush hour. about 100 Can-
adian bacon and dill pickel sand-

wiches are consumed in 20 minutes!’

The Tuck Shop—It‘s Wonderful!

Peterson Talks

To High School

Edwin L. Peterson. assistant pro-
fessor of English, will be principal
speaker at the commencement exer-
cises at Titusville
May 26.

Before some 2,000 students, he
will discuss national defense, cen-
tering his speech about “strength of
character as the first bulwark of
national defense.”

Peterson spoke once before in Ti-
tusville to a woman’s club and at-
tributes this as the main reason for
his being asked to speak at the coin-
mencement exercises.

In addition to teaching a creative
writing course at the University,
Peterson contributes literary arti-
cles to leading American magazines.
He is the author of the book “No
Life So Happy,” published last
year.

Peterson is a graduate of the Uni-
versity and obtained his MA degree
here.

Roberts Gives

Yearly Report
Of SF A Crou p

The following is the complete re-
port of Joseph L. Roberts, C41, re-
tiring president of SFA, submitted
at Wednesday’s final meeting of the
1940-41 assembly:

This report is submitted to the
students of the University to ac-
quaint them with the activities of
the Student Faculty Association
during the school year, 1940-41.
“The purpose of the Association
shall be to provide additional xvays
by which faculty and students may
work together on common problems
and, through these joint activities,
enrich lurther the collective life, as
well as the life of the ll‘lCllVlClLl«'.-ll at
the University.”——-quoted from Ar-
ticle II of the constitution of the
organization. Although the pur-
pose has been changed as to its
wording, it still carries the same
meaning as the one we operated
undeu
Accomplishments

One of the most important ac-
complishments in light of the pur-
pose of the Association for the As-
sembly and the faculty was the close
cooperation with the administration.
Several Executive committee meet-
ings were held with Dr. Bowman in
which we discussed student prob-
lems, problems which were asked
most 0. ten by you, the student body.
The outcome of those meetings was
the Chancellor’s Assembly for the
students, at which he frankly an-
swered the questions which had
been submitted by the Statistics
committee. This assembly was the
ﬁrst one of its kind given for the
present student body, and helped
considerably in bringing a closer
relationship between administration
and student body. .

Most of SFA’s work is necessar-
ily done through committees. As-
semblies usually report the progress
of committees and make sugges-
tions to the committee.

The Executive committee of SFA
is composed of the officers of the
organization plus two student mem-
bers at large and three administra-
tive’ representatives. The commit-
tee guides all the business of SFA‘
outside of the assembly meetings
and is responsible, to the,asse_xnbly

for’th‘e‘wo‘rk‘done‘ by all‘ the other’

committces. It may set up at any
time a committee to aid in fulﬁll-
ing the purpose of SFA.
Revision

In an effort to make the assem-

V bly a more effective group and SPA

a more representative body, a Can-
stitutional Revision "committee was
appointed under the chairmanship
of David Tucker. This committee
recommended several changes in our
constitution, some. of which. were
passed, some rejected, and 1 some
referred back to the committee for
further consideration. The Exec-
utive committee believes that the

Gamma Sigma Phi Ends Government. Service
Survey on‘ Tuitio'n’,__Courses, Practice" Work

Gamma Sigma Phi, professional’

government service fraternity, to-
day announced the ﬁndings of a
special committee appointed to study
conditions of the governmental serv-
ice courses at the University.
Cramming enough subjects into
the course, setting a standard tui-
tion to include‘ more subjects, and
municipal interneship were discuss-
ed in the committee report.
Cumming In "Problem
The vital problem is that of try-
ing ‘to cram into a“ limited time of
about four years the courses neces-
sary to give the student a compre-
hensive background and- a ‘practical
basis for coping with the technical
civil service examinations, the com-
mittee emphasized in the report.
Hiram Milton‘, C42, chairman of

the committee,. was assisted by

Davld Deener, C41,
Frankston, C41.

and Arthur

The "committee" recommended the

expansion of the course to‘ permit 

governmental service students to

carry 15 credits a semester of back- .

ground courses, and as many addi-
tional credits as possible while keep-
ing a'2~.O quality- point average.
Standard Tuition

Tuition, according to the report,
should be set at $150 a.se'mester,
even though the number ofcredits
is more than the usual amount. ‘ At
the‘ beginning of the preseﬁtschool
yea.r,,'the'tuition of studentsin the
governmental service courses had
been set at $150 providing that the
number of credits did not exceed
the number specified in the curricu-
lum.

Concerning the chances of mu-
nicipal intemeship, the committee
suggested thatthe opportunities for
part-time employment be investi-
gated to discover the possibilities

which may be available both for
governmental service studentsiand
for chemistry or engineering‘ stu-
dents. _. _
Through a system of municipal
interneship, the “student can gain
practical knowledge in government-
al affairs by acquiring minor posi-
tions in civil service. , . .
The committee made the sugges-

tion that these positions be made‘

available to the students during the
summer months.

Recommends Recognition

The report also recommended
that the University administration
recognize the Intercollegiate Con-
ference on Government as an ac-
credited activity, ‘and that it put in-
to effect some method of merit ‘se-
lection of delegates and a system’-,
other than the limited one now in
effect. for subsidizing the delegates.

“Complete Surprise”

Although Ruane, in taking over
the chair from retiring president
Joe Roberts, BA4l, declared the
election was “a complete sur-
prise” to him, it came as noun-
expected act to campus political
observers, who, with litt.le'difl°1cul-
ty were able also to predic the
other officers and members of the
executive committee. H

The election of an executive
committee comprised of four fra-
ternity members and two inde-
pendents, when the fraternities
through their majority of 24 seats
to 6 might well have had all the
executive posts, was regarded by
most campus politicos as a step
designed to add to the prestige of
the committee.

Preceding the elect’on of officers,
the final reports of the SFA com-
mittees were submitted. Most sig-
nificant of these is the report 0.
the Executive committee, submit-
ted by Roberts, the complete text

paper.

Other Reports

Other reports presented at Wed-
nesd-ay’s ﬁnal meeting included that
of the Essefay Theater committee.
headed by Tait, which presented
seven movies on Thursday after-
noons throughout the school year.

Hiram Milton, C42, presented

tation committee in which be de-
clared that although the committee
and its work had ot’ﬁcially,expired

terest on the part of the assembly,”
David Tucker, C41, chairrnan of

mittee, also submitted his report in
which he stated that his commit-
tee __ was forced to work by itself,
hindered by a ‘lack of -constructive
criticism for assembly members,
while the fate of his constitutional
revision plan w‘as~ sealed’ from the
onset. Tucker charged that major-

\Ve all know by now that we’re in this war

And we’re going to take the fatal step in a
The president has said that
convoys mean shooting and shooting means war.

very few weeks.

And by war he means real honest-to-God-war,
not the piddling around we have been doing up
to now.

The president has gone into all this with his
head up knowing from one minute to the next
just where he was going and why. We haven’t
kept our heads up and we don’t know where
we are going or why. This is partly the fault
of the president and partly the fault of our
news and opinion sources. The Pitt News is
also responsible but not nearly so much as the
kept press with its tremendous resources for
getting news, reporting it, and interpreting it.

For instance the most important aspect of
the war, What can we expect to do after the
whole shooting match is over, has never been
adequately discussed in any newspaper or maga-
zine we have ever seen. We don’t mean the
question of VVar Aims (though we’ve turned our
hands to that at times). We mean Peace Pos-
sibilities; that is, what are the possibilities after
the war?

The possibilities should guide us in our
espousal of the war. For if our individual ideas
for peace have a good chance of being fulﬁlled,
then we can easily go to war. With our indus-
trial potential and our present’ political leader-
ship we can hardly lose. But if we see that our
post-war reconstruction principles will probably
be overlooked or put down with a ruthless hand,
then we can be suspicious of war. For, like the
last one the US fought, it may turn into a
great ﬁasco.

The big question before all the politicians
and all the business men and all of us is, Are
we going to get out of this war what we want
out of it? This question is not to be answered
by the stop-gap statement that we are ﬁghting
merely to preserve what we have already. Not
only is this negative approach merely a stop-
gap, but it is also unrealistic. For what we will
have after the war depends mightily on what
we want before we go into it. How the war
will be run depends just as much on what we
want out of it as on any other factor. And who
will run the war depends on what the Amer-
ican people want to be the result of that war.

-As far as we can see there are at present two
broad fronts that desire outright military in-
tervention—in the form of convoys now, troops

later. These broad fronts take in as diverse per-'

sonalities as-—-on the left side:

iR.adi‘cal ‘Maxi Eastman, communist Lewis

The Pitt News

Discussion: Power After the War

Knudsen, and the multitudes of dollar-a-year
men.

Their ideas of a post-war world differ also.
The business men, the Tories and conservative
Republicans, want most of all to stand in the
same pleasant spot as long as possible. They
would like to keep things as they are, or as they
once were. The business men want free trade.
free markets, less governmental control of busi-
ness, the expansion of American-British indus-
trial and financial control, possibly colonies, the
eventual defeat of the Soviet Union, and the re—
establishment of national states. This is not
all, but it gives a pretty good idea of what the
world will try to be like should the business man
rule after the war.

The liberal—radicals—those who believe some
kind of change necessary——have vastly different
ideas than the status-quo business men. _ Al-
though men like assistant president Willkie have
mentioned something about correcting the
abuses of capitalism, the business man in gen-
eral has little sympathy with, or little under-
standing of such proposals. But President
‘Roosevelt has shown that he is deﬁnitely inter-
ested in change even if it is to the disadvantage
of proﬁts.

Those who follow his leadership and that of
the British Labor party expect to change the
world much after the war. They want the de-
feat of militant fascism, a lasting peace, the
extension into all countries of the New Deal
social theories—diluted socialism. They look
forward to the gradual freedom of present day
colonies, the gradual re-employment of the mil-
lions out of work, the gradual disappearance of
the quarreling national state. They truly be-
lieve in gradual social and economic justice.

Here are the two broad fronts of militant
democracy. What they want differs. Yet each
ﬁgures to use the other to get in supreme power.

What we will have in the world after the
war depends largely on who wins supreme power
in the United States. In business the conserva-
tives have always held it. Yet in the last 8
years, the liberals almost succeeded in shaking
loose the hold of business on the country. Now
the liberals own only the political seats; the bus-
iness men have been running our war prepara-
tion.

Men will die for an ideal, not for free trade
or ﬁnancial control. Industry will work for
proﬁts, not for social justice or gradual social-
ization. The liberals have ‘provided the spirit
for war, the conservatives have provided the
half-way effective industrial production to date.

Now that we mustltake the few last steps
toward ﬁnal involvement, stop a moment and
look at what you want.

V Ask yourself whether your ideological group
will havecontrol after the war. Ask. yourself
whether, if the liberals win, you want to reform
the world. Or ask yourself whether, if-. the con-
servatives win, you want to go back to cyclic

‘depressions and national wars and the breeding

grounds of, fascism. , , _

Vvhat is an optimist? In all my
life, I have known only one. He
was 97 years old. He married a wo-
man of 84 and bought a house near
a school.

And I suppose he signed a 25-
year mortgage and started a chick-
en farm and took out an insurance
policy on his son.

Would have, but he was too busy
teething.

I knew a guy who was a pessim-
ist. He always carried a letter
from his priest that began, “Dear
God, Attached ﬁnd one mortal soul,
slightly soiled . . .” '

In my life, I have known only
one pessimist. He lived in Green-
land and every day before he went
out he rubbed on his back a lotion
for the prevention of sunburn.

The Female
& the Speeious

. By EDITH ROSENBLATT

So many things are happening to
spoil a perfectly good May.

For one thing, readers aggravate
me. I keep getting papers back
with comments written in code.
One wise guy compared me with an
airplane—— ﬂying around through
clouds and never landing. Hmmm.,
that makes me one up on gravity.
Another reader said that my paper
was succinct. Now that worries me.
He mightn’t have meant exactly
that.

0 Paper Hanging

And there’s that term paper
hanging over me. I couldn’t ﬁnd
the notes for it the other day. Then
somebody asked me if they’re wear-
ing fiounces on sport coats this sea-
son. Ha! I reached into the pocket
way down to the hem, and there
were the potential term paper, four
kleenexes, and a_ card telling me to
vote the white ticket. The paper’s

Pitt Thinclads End Home

Season Against Temple

The Pitt track team seeks to continue its mastery over the Temple
spike-wearers as the two teams clash in the last meet of the home sea-

son at Pitt stadium tomorrow afternoon.

According to the form chart the Panth

the Owls are bringing a team here,
but the News prediction gives the
Panthers about a 90-41 victory.
Never offering strong competition,
the visitors don’t even have the
hurdlers this year that usually kept
them in the meet.

For the Panthers it will be the
last appearance on the Stadium oval

for co-captains Del Anderson and
Joe Newman, Regis Larkin, Larry
Tregoning, Henry Sulkowski, Walt
Sterner, Dave McDowell, Ted
Konetsky, Frank McCabe, Walt
Fridley, Paul MacNeill, and Bud
Graf. Pitt fans who have failed to
see Anderson, Newman, Larkin,
Tregoning, and Sterner in action
will have their ‘last opportunity to
watch some of the East’s best to-
morrow.

Annual Attempt

Co-captain Del Anderson makes
his annual attempt to run the mile
tomorrow. With his victory prac-
tically assured in the 880, Olson will
put this half-miler deluxe in the
longer distance tomorrow. More
than scoring points, Olson seems in-
terested in ﬁnding out whether An-
dersoncan run a 4:20 mile. Ander-
son ran a magnificent race against
Campbell Kane last Saturday and
must be rated among the ICAAAA
contenders. For one year he
chased Johnny Woodruff. Last
year he improved rapidly, but has
hit his peak as a half-miler and
also as quarter miler on the anchor
leg of the mile relay,

One of the team’s hardest work-
ers, co-captain Newman makes his
final home eﬁort to break the Uni-
versity high hurdle mark of 15 sec-
onds ﬁat, held by Kenny Ryden. A
hot day and the pressure that junior
Bill Cooper’s hot breath has been
making on his back the last few
days might bring him down to 14.8
or 14.9.

“Trigger”

Another of the sure point win-
ners in the contest is senior Tre-
goning, a consistent scorer over the
last three years in the 100, 220, 440,
and mile relay. “Trigger” had his
best season as a yearling, winning
three Penn Relays watches and
placing in the ICAAAA champion-
ships. An injury has hampered

LARRY TREGONING
farewell appearance

him most of this year, but a return
to his 1939 form is expected soon.

The surprise competitors of the
year among the seniors are Regis
Larkin and Dave McDowell, Lark-
in’s brilliant work thus far and
McDowell’s mediocre performances
causing the comment. Never don-
ning a track shoe until his junior
year, Larkin climaxed a sparkling
campaign by whipping Kane last
Saturday.

Tomorrow and Tomorrow

Tomorrow may see Larkin going
below 49 seconds in the 440. Even
without doing that, the case of this
senior proves that a high school
reputation isn’t necessary for star-
dom in college. On the other hand,
McDowell after jumping six feet
four in high school has failed to
clear six feet this year. He did hit
six-ﬁve his junior year; conse-
quently Olson hopes that the Tem-
ple meet will bring a return to
form.

A new Stadium record will be
the object of Sterner’s work in the
two mile. Cross country captain
for the last two seasons, Sterner
turned in the fastest time of his
career for two miles at Blooming-
ton last Saturday, 9:35. A like per-
formance against the Owls would
create a new standard.

This season was his last chance.
And. he came through nobly, win-
ning all five of his EIGA singles
matches and all but one match in
foursome competition.

Jack‘s total of seven points (‘-2
for each doubles win) placed him in
a tie for the league leadership with
Seybold of Penn State, Donohue of
Georgfetoxvii, and Zimmerman of
Princeton. all members of league
leading teams.

The Panther golf squad finished
the EIGA season in fourth place
with two wins and three defeats,
behind Georgetown, Penn State, and
Princeton, each with a league rec-
ord of four victories against one
loss.

This morning at Stamford. Con-

Penn State Team in Home Finale, 19-5

Pitt's rapidly improving baseball
team brought its 1941 home cam-
paign to a successful close Wednes-
day when they pounded four Penn
State pitchers for a 19-5 victory.
The win for the Panthers stretched
their win streak to six games ancl
brougltt their season record to eight
wins against two losses.

The Panthers opened up their at-
tack in the first inning when they
scored three runs to go into a lead

which they held throughout the
game. A single by Straloski. a

triple by Bush, and successive hits
by Vaiksnor and Guadagnino ac-
counted for the Pitt tallies.
Panther Jumps

Continuing where they left off
in the first, the Panthers jumped
on Lion hurlers Richardson and
Robinson to score eight runs and
clinch the game. Five Pitt hits to-
gether with several Penn State err-
ors were responsible for the eight
tallies.

The State team managed to show
signs oi life in their half of the

From Faculty Niel:
With the scheduled game only a

Nick Kliskey still scans the faculty
list of pe:-l’ovrmers for more re-
cruits. Their annual game with
the varsity team will be played
May 20. So please, faculty mem-
bers, help Kliskey out a bit by
volunteering to play for his
team. All you have to do is phone
him, and he will greet you with
open arms.

Pitt Net Squad
Beats Tech, 7-2

Pitt’s tennis team came out 01'
their momentary lapse long enough
Wednesday afternoon to trounce a
mediocre Carnegie Tech team, 7-2.

The Panthers had a habit of los-
ing the first game, and then com-
ing back to beat their opponents
in the last two games. But regard-
less of how they did it, the victory
over Tech pushes the team average
over the 500 per cent mark.

Captain Ed Goehring opened the
scoring by beating Durker, 3-6, 6-0,
6-1. Trimble, Gaenger, and Reese
followed by annexing points for the
Pitt cause.

In the doubles competition, the
Panther combination of Goehring
and Winn, Gran-ce and Trimble, and

managed to tally one run in each
irame.

With the score standing at 12-2
at the end of the fourth. the Panth-
ers again went on their hitting spree
in the fifth and
sixth, once in the seventh. and twice
in the eighth. State finished their
scoring with one in the ﬁfth and
two in the first half of the ninth.

and scored twice

In winning the Panthers connect-
ed for a total of twenty hits. Extra
base safeties tor the Pitt nine were
by Vaiksnor, Goelz. Bush. Guadag-
nine, and Brown. O1‘ the above.
Bush and Johnny Brown had home
runs while the others had two base
iits.

Panther Attacks ‘

Leading the attack for the Panth-
ers were center.-°ielder Al Bush and
catcher Guy Guadagnino, both of
whom came through with four safe-
ties. Bush managed to connect ior
a single, a double, a triple, and a
home run. m Guadagnino had three
singles and :1 double.

For State, second baseman Sapp
paced the hitting, collecting three
hits out of four trips to the plate.
Also playing a potent part  the
plate were left fielder Gates and
right fielder Perugini.

The win was credited to Bobby
Malloy who raised his number of
wins to live. In handing the State
nine their worst setback of the year.

and aliowed eleven hits.

State Lives

Penn State lived up to the pre-
game expectations and committed
a total of seven errors in losing to
the Panthers. These mis-cues to-
gether with a number 01' wild pitch-
es by the unsteady Lion hurlers en-
abled the Pitt team to score their
most lop-sided win of the season.
The Panthers, on the other hand,
were charged with four errors.

Perhaps the best explanation for
the complete collapse of the Penn
State team is the fact that the Blue
