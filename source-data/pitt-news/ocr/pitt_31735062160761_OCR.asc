 Takes 5
SGA Posts '

By MURRAY CHASS
At 8:45 p.m. last Wednes-

H day night Bert O’Malley step-

ped-down as president o_f In-
terfraternity Council and two
hours later at 10:45 he be-
came the ﬁrst President of
Student Government Association.

O’Ma1ley, Allied Collegiate can-
didate, downed United Independ-
ent hopeful Richard Mattern in a
record student election total vote
of 2044 ballots. The new SGA
leader drew 1057 votes, Mattern
had 929.

The largest turnout for an elec-
tion previous to this was 2037 stu-

 

resident O’Malley

famous “Publius.”

This year the two
tually divided the
positions in SGA, the Allied
Collegiates winning six places,
the United Independents captur-
ing ﬁve. -

The evident split in the large
vote was shown in the race for
vice president, as well as the re-
maining SGA representative posi-
Ations.

UI candidate John Strauch de-
feated Mark Elovitz for the second
spot with a 1016 total. Elovitz,
strangely enough, had the exact
same tally as Mattern, 929.

An unparallel result was ac-
complished in the race for sen-
ior ,representatives to SGA. Two
women, Sally Nelson (AC), and
Ann Papieski (UI). won posi-
tions. The third spot in that

parties vir-
number of

group went to John Sullivan

(AC).

Sally, in fact, drew the highest
number of votes in the election,
1158. Sullivan had the second‘
highest, 1116, while Ann totaled
983.

He was elected by a vote of
750 to 699 over United Inde-

pendent candidate J a m e s

Bill Kaliden, United Indepen-

presidency. The vote was 745 to
691 over Bob DiCicco.

Jack Trant (AC won the posi-
tion of secretary over Mike
Altman (UI) by a tally of 751-
679. . g \

Randy Marlier for Chief Justice
and Stanley Franzos for treasurer
“were unopposed AC candidates.

A total vote of 1449 was cast
for Men’s Council positions.

As was true for SGA posi-
tions, the vote was predomin-
antly in the Commons Room
where, for instance, 563 votes
were polled for Lichtman as op-
posed to 394 for Pomarico.

The Student Union polled the
second largest number of votes
among the four polling places.
Here the trend was opposite to
that in the Commons Room. Two

In SGA Race
After Big Vote

(Continued from Page 1)

Three junior positions went to
Jim Finnegan (AC), 1053 votes,
David Breakstone (UI), 1013, and
,Ann Pongratz (AC), 1001.

Fred Whittier (AC) led sopho-
more hopefuls with 1058 votes,
Lois Capin (UI) with 1055 votes,
and Woody Turner (UI) with 963,
won the other two positions.

Both the victorious O’Malley
and the defeated Mattern were
pleased with the record turnout.
They also are looking forward,
to co-operation in SGA of the
.two parties.

Following are the post-election
statements of the two.

O’Malley: “The campaign was
very, hard and well-conducted on
the part of both parties, ,but the
results were very gratifying in
that the University had an all-
time record turnout. As in all
cases a good man had to lose, and
the UI party certainly had a cap-
able candidate in Dick Mattern.

,“.I feel that this will be a

make or break year for SGA.

But with the co-operation of the

entire group, I’m sure‘ that we

can raise the standards of Pitt
student government to .an- all-
time high.”

Mattern: “The most satisfying
thing about the election is the rec-
ord student vote which demon-
strated to me that the extension
of the vote to the entire student
body will ultimately result in re-
sponsible student government
resting on indipendent principles.

“I “feel conﬁdent ‘that both
O’Malley and Strauch will co-
operate for a respectable SGA.”

THE POWER OF POS|TIVE"WRlNKLlNG

While everybody knows that
the soft collar on Van Heusen
Century Shirts won’t wrinkle,
ever, a Van’ Heusen survey
among college students has
revealed that precious few
know why. Here are some of
the responses:

J. L.-——sophomore at the
Psycltodynamic Institute for
Arts, Crafts, and N umberPat°nt-
z'ng—“Obviously, the collar
won’t wrinkle, because it’s
afraid to Wrinkle. It may have
been threatened by some surly
Van Heusen vice-president.
Ergo, it exhibits the Cavandish
anti-wrinkle syndrome.”

G.,F.~—jum'or at Usury
School of Advertisz'ng——‘ ‘Collar-
wise, there's no demand for
wrinkles. No customer beneﬁt.
Now, this is strictly off the
top of my cranium, but‘ the
statement, fthe soft collar that
won’t wrinkle, ever,’ is too
negative. Substitute ‘never’ for
‘ever’ and you not only have

 

a positive statement-~but——
as demonstrated by that
famous cigarette, this
ungrammatical concept will be

attention-getting.”

L. V.——sem'or quarterback at
M iltown College——“I wouldn't
be without a Van Heusen.
Look here . . . under my pleat-
less shoulder pads. See? Out
of_ simpledecency, the collar"
refrains from wrinkling. It’s
this kind of restraint that
recently led to our glorious
victory overiBirdbrain U. Not
a man was scathed. Huzzah for
the,col1ar—and ﬁght furiously, .
fellows.” ”

“Yes, this is the kind of’
ignorance we run across.
Actually, while other collars
are made of 3 pieces of mate-
rial, the secret of this soft collar
with its wrinkle-shunning
qualities is one-piece con-
struction. Van Heusen Cen-
tury shirts come in 5 collar
styles. $4 and $5.

terest has always been toward lit-

erature and he has published some

poetry and several essays in na-
tional literary magazines.

“I plan to discuss the effects of
social environment on the crea-

. tive process,” he said. “There is a

relevence of poetry and the arts in
general to the progress of civiliza-
tion," he continued.

“If a casual relationship can
be demonstrated, then fine arts
becomes a reliable index of the
probable course of civilization.”
I want to deﬁne the effect of the
mental climate of the Twentieth
Century on poetry and ﬁne
arts.”

In contrast to ﬁne arts, Gordon
Fleming's interest lies in theoreti-
cal physics. Fleming, Col. ’58, is

"the only one of the speakers who

is a native of Pittsburgh. His sub-
ject will be “General Implications
of Modern Logic.”

~ “There seems to be an inherent
limitation in humans in the simul-
taneous achievement of both pre-
cision and conten in a given
statement.” -

He plansto show some of the
principles of modern logic which
are no longer considered to be
totally true.. »

Abbas Heydari, Col. ’59, will
lead another of the seminars. He
has always been interested in so-
cial and international affairs. His
talk will beion “Should U.S. For-
eign Policy be Changed?”

Heydari, a native of Tehran,
Iran, is a justice in Men’s Court,
delegate to Student Congress and
chairman of the Lecture and
Drama subcommittee of the As-
semblies Committee.

In- his seminar he will discuss
the United States’ foreign pol-
icy, but will give some special
emphasis to the Middle East.

“There is need for better mu-
tual understanding between the
people of the United States and
the people of other nations,” he
said. “Foreign Policy should be re-
vised to match this increased un-
derstanding.”

“There is also the necessity to
improve the quality of economic
aid or its distribution,” he added.
“I think that the psychology and
the form of societies of countries
which receive aid should deter-
mine the type of program which
the United States carries out.

“I also want to give an opti-

Langley Books

On Experiment

Two volumes by Samuel Pier-
pont Langley, concerning his early
experiments conducted on the
University of Pittsburgh campus,
have been presented to the Uni-
versity by Admiral Joseph Lude-
wig. ,

The experiments are in connec-
tion with the theory of flight.
“Experiments in Aerodynamics”
and “Langley Memoir on Mechan-
ical Flight” are the titles of the
books. ’

Langley was the first director
of the University’s Allegheny
Observatory in 1867 and or-
ganized its ﬁrst systematic ob-
servation and research.

On the lawn of the old Observ-
atory at the top of Perrysville
Avenue Langley constructed his
“whirling table,” forerunner of
the wind tunnel used today in
aeronautical experimentation.

eign policy,” he concluded.

In contrast to the psychology of
nations, Edmond Partridge, Col.
'59, will speak ‘about “Religion and
Psychology” in his seminar.

Partridge, who is married and
is now a postulant for Holy Orders
in the Protestant Episcopal
Church, is a member of Student
Council of Religious Organizations

He spent some time in Lehigh
College, the electrical industry,
television and the Army ‘before
coming to Pitt. During that time
he decided to go into the ministry.

He believes that religion and
psychology both have as a prime
interest, helping man. “'I‘l'1oughT
they have different views, they
use similar methods,” he said.
“Understanding them maymhelp
man to understand himself and
realize his full potential.”

In his talk he said that he will
be more concerned with the teach-
ing aspects of both, rather than
the worship part of religion. I

seminars will be announced in the

“Barefoot Boy with Cheek.")

— A FRAT To REMEMBER

Every year, as we all know, the Benevolent and Protective

Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize
to the fraternity house which, in its judgment, has done the
most to promote and enhance the fraternity way of life. The
prize this year—eight -hundred pounds of putty-—goes to the
Alpha Hernia chapter of the South Dakota College of Dentistry
and Renaissance'Art. —

The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for the
Alpha Hernia house is the very model of all a fraternity should
be. It is, ﬁrst of all, a most attractive house physically. The
outside walls are tastefully covered with sequins. Running along
the upper story is a widow’s walk, with a widow stationed every
three feet. Moored to the chimneypot is the Graf Zeppelin.

gr/iii"...
_ Indoors the house gives an impression of simple, casual charm.
The clmpter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz,
with a dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred

feet in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool
with the housemother bouncing on the top.

Members: rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which fold into the wall and are never seen again. Each
room also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp,
and a catapult for skeet-shooting. Kidney—shaped desks are
available for kidney-shaped members.

Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboros stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to enjoy a ﬁne ﬁltered cigarette in any room of the house, all
one need do is reach out one’s hand in any direction and pick
up a Marlboro. Then one rubs two pledges together, lights one’s,

‘Marlboro, and puffs with sweet content the tastiest smoke the

mind of _man has yet devised.

The decor, the grace, the Marlboros, all combine to make
Alpha Hernia a real gasser of a fraternity. But a fraternity is
more than things; it isalso people. And it is in the people depart-
ment that Alpha Hernia really shines. ‘

Alpha Hernia has among its members the biggest BMOCS
on the entire campus of the South Dakota College of Dentistry
and Renaissance Art. There is, for instance, William Make-
pcace Sigafoos, charcoal and bun chairman of the annual Stamp
Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner of last year’s
All-South Dakota State Monoply Championship, 135 Pound
Class. Then there is Rock Schwartz, who can sleep standing up.

Then there is Tremblant Placebo, who can crack pecans in his ‘

armpits. Then there is Ralph Tungsten, who went bald at eight.

But why go on? One can see what a splendid bunch of chaps
there is in Alpha Hernia, and when one sees them at the house
in the cool of the evening, all busy with their tasks-some

picking locks, some playing Jacks-or-Better, some clipping’

Playboy-—one’s heart ﬁlls up and one’s eyes grow misty, and
one cannot but give three cheers and a tiger for Alpha Hernia,
fraternity of the year! A

Physical Fitness
Becomes Problem

By no KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

 

-Education, Science, and Mathematics are not the only
subjects expounded by leaders in the government and aca-

demic ﬁelds. An ever increasing problem today is the physical
ﬁtness of American Youth.

The situation has become more acute in recent years as

investigations,‘ authorized by the President of the United
States, have shown that the European Youth are more advanced than
American Youth not only in science. and mathematics, but also in
physical education. The,te,sts conducted in these investigations were
-n’ot.of skill in physical ﬁtness, but of strength.

The awareness of this critical problem has brought forth a
number of recommendations by the Presidential Committee on
Physical Education: ‘

1. Communities emphasize to school boards the need for plan-
ning community schools which include facilities for community youth
fitness programs during nonschool as well as school hours. I

2. Parents be encouraged to assume a full share of the responsi-
bility for ﬁtness in the family. ‘ T

3. Every school have a continuing program which tests the

ﬁtness of youth, develops favorable attitudes, towards sound body »

and healthy personality, and attends to the correction of physical,
emotional, and mental maladjustments and defects.

4. Understanding of professional responsibility be increased.

5. Physical education, health education, recreation, and“ all ﬁelds
concerned directly with attaining youth ﬁtness objectives receive in-
creased recognition and adequate compensation. '

Everyone recognizes the need and necessity of a good physical
ﬁtness program for the student body.-The question arises as to where
it should be started? The obvious place is in the lower grade‘ levels
where good habits may be formed and followed. This is vitally
necessary especially in our economy today.

The American Youth has it soft as ever. Every place he goes, he
rides. If he doesn’t make a team sport in grade school, high school, or
college he will not think of indulging in other individual sports be-
cause he has or can get very little or no instruction when needed.

This will even be truer in the future. At present the work week
is 40 hours, but the trend is to reduce it to 36 or even a possible 32
hours in some occupations. How will the excess time be put to good
use if the population is not trained now to do so. ,

Before any correction can be made inthe grade schools or high
schools, steps should ﬁrst be taken in the colleges and universities,
who are supposed. to be leaders in their ﬁeld, to educate future
teachers and parents who inturn can take steps to insure a proper
well-rounded academic and athletic program. ,

Here at Pitt, Athletic Director Captain Tom Hamilton has sub-
mitted to the Faculty for careful consideration a “Request to increase
the graduation requirement by two credits to allow for a four semes-

_ ter Required Physical Education Course for Men and Women.”

"Captain Hamilton. further pointed out that “The adoption of a two
year course in Physical Educationiwill permit the University ofAPitts-
burgh to better fulﬁll its mission of producinglwell rounded graduates,
and carry out its responsibilities in meetinga national need. This
improvement will be another step in the new university aim to up-
grade the standards of all educational areas.” I

Feels SportNotAttended

By SALLY WERNER
The Panther Gymnastic Team owes a vote of thanks to

the city of Philadelphia. In its ﬁve year life, the 12 member‘

team has had a total of seven Philadelphians, not to mention
their coach, Warren Neiger. An outstanding member of this
year’s seven man group is the Blue and Gold Flying Ririg
Champion, Tob Darling.

Tom, or Tweety as his Phi Gam
brothers call him, has three ﬂying
ring championships. He holds the
Eastern Inter- ‘ — =   '-
collegiate title, 
the National In- *
t e r c o llegiate j-3
title, and the "_:
National Amer-
i c a n Athletic
Union title. In
competition two
weeks ago at
P e n n S t a t e,
Tom _ success-
fully defended
his E a s t e r n

tention in Pittsburgh. At the Uni-
versity, he feels, “There is not
enough school spirit which is no-
ticeable at other school events.”

coming national competition as the
man to beat.

a chance. to go to Michigan State
to defend. one and then on to Cali-
fornia to defend the other.

Around school, Tom does not
play the role of a champ. If not
in classes, he can usually be
found at the Feld House prac-
ticing,’ or at the Frat House‘
“1oaﬁng._” An all-a_round athlete,
Tom was IF Diving Champ. Be-
sides all this, his brothers can
vouch for his pinochle playing.

On rare occasions when he does
get home, the Phys. Ed. major can
be found around 4 a.m. out ﬁshing
with his family. During the last
ﬁve summers, Tom has been a
camp counselor.-This ties‘ in with
his future plans, for upon gradua-

West to get a college coaching job.

Although mild mannered, Tom
takes his sport seriously. He thinks
