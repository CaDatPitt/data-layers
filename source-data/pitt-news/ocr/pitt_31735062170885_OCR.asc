Council of HurnaniConcern Assigned

  Racism at Pitt Investigated

byJOHN POULIN g
’ A special meeting of the Uni-

C versity Senate was held Friday

afternoon to discuss racism at

Pitt. At the open session a resolu-~

tion was passed to assign a 'ICot..1-
cil of Human Concern” to further
investigate the problems, and to
present its conclusions and rec-

_- ommendati/dns within six months.

Dr. Emmanuel Anise, a profes-
sor in the Department of Political
Science, opened the session with a
discussion of “institutionalized
racism.” stemming from what he
called “cultural predisposition"
in America.

He said that very often discrim-
ination appears as an “oversight,”

and although it is a very real and‘

foremost problem ingthe United
States, many people arenot “sen-
sitive” to discriminatory situa-
tions. The result, he said, is often
an “it just didn’t occur to me” at-
titude. ’ .

Anise’s favors a “more scholarly
energy to research this area." He
added that there has never been
"an attempt to treat racism as a
pathology," as he feel-s it should
be. America's treatment of ra-
cial discrimination has been
wrong from the beginning, Anise
maintains;_ the question now is
"whether we are going to be able
to live it down." - -

Anise’s address was followed

by a proposal to'establish a Uni-

versity-sponsored Office to Coun-
ter Institutionalized Racism. Cur-
tiss Porter, professor of Black
Studies, said that agpresent there
is not effective approach to eradi-

cate institutionalized racism.
hence the need for the office.

He said that a “working anti-

racism sensibility” is needed. The
proposed office, explained Porter,
would deal with racism on the lev-
el of “/‘human sensibility in the in-
dividual,” as well as in “the col-
lective work force of the institu-
tion.” _
A Porter pointed out examplesof
racial bias in curriculums and in
the attitudes of administrators,
faculty and students, adding that
racism must be attacked on"‘all
levels of human interaction“ with-
in the University.

In discussion which followed.
a counter proposal to further in-
vestigate the problem of racism
at Pitt rather than immediately
establish the proposed office was
seconded. It was argued that the
extent of racialbias within ‘the

‘school is_unknown at this point.

and the exact functions of the'pro-
posed office were not clear.

Advocates of the proposed of-
fice retaliated that the time had
come for action, not for more dia-
logue. As one person commented,

“We think it’s 3 o'clock in the af-
ternoon and that all hell is going
to break loose at 12 tonight. Well
it’s actually ll:‘55—so we better
get going.”

But the counter proposal to es-
tablish _the Council to study the
problem more thoroughly was
passed."The Council will be com-
prised of students,_'faculty, and
administrators from all ethnic
backgrounds, and will be appoint-
ed by the Senate Council in con-
junction with the Black Studies
Department.

In other business. the Black Ac-
tion Society (BAS) proposed more
conserted efforts by the Universi-
ty to insure that state and federal

spending would not be decreased

in the future. Although discussion
of the matter was tabled until
the next meeting. Chancellor Pos-
var interjected that the Univer-
sity is already looking in_to the
problem. '

The final item on the agenda
was‘a proposal by Students for a’
Democratic Society (SDS) to con-

Model Cities Commissionl,

Voids Student Election

by JIM HOSEK
(DPPA) The Model Cities Com-

m mission last week ‘decided to up-

hold the report of the election
committee. voiding the Dec. 2
election of Duquesne’s William J.
Ragsdale and John W. Stanko to
the commission. k

The report of the election com-
mittee, which is now headed by
Marian Charles, had previously
voted 3-1 to void the students’ elec-
tion on the grounds that impro-
per electioneering had taken place
and that the Towers as a votin
area constituted an “unfair ad-
vantage” to Stanko and Ragsdale.
And this is the report passed by
the commission.

Upholding the belief that Model '

Cities Chairman John B. Grice
manipulated the meeting three
weeks .ago so that Stanko and
Ragsdale would not be seated, he
broke the tie and cast the key vote
to uphold the committee report.

Previous to this vote which was
done by commissioners standing
up to show their preference, there
was a vote by hands, which re-

he has produced ‘and’ directed
Face the Nation from CBS's
Washington Bureau.

. Last Thursday night, Vitarelli
returned to ‘Pitt to give the key-
note address at the Chancellor's
Dinner.

Bob Vitarelli has been a man
of firsts, having directed many
historical events for TV audi-
ences. But the event that is of the
most importance was President
Nixon’s trip to China. Vitarelli di-
rected the entire live coverage of
that trip for all three TV net-,
works.

In Vitarelli‘s talk to the alum-
ni and undergraduates of the
Greek system at Pitt. he center-
ed on his experiences while in
China. He made note of the fact
that while to TV audiences news
_men in China seemed to have had
a great deal of freedom. such was
not the case.

The reporters and staff were

~ closely watched and in fact every

technician had a Chinese counter-.
part; Vitarelli was the oWnly’per-

Baraka said that the struggle
was to create a national black or-
ganization to tak'e. the place of the
many separate “tribes“ which

have evolved in the U.S. to pro-

mote black interests-

Referring to the liberation of
the blacks, Baraka said, “If we
don’t do it ourselves no one else is
going to do it. We are not against
anyone,’_but we must be for our-
selves.”

Baraka said that the black na-
tionalism of the 1960s has died
out and been replaced by apathy.
He claims the black movement is
being run by “people who are full

of theories of reaction. but no ac-

tion."

' "First." explained Baraka. "we
are black people. We must under-
stand that identity and then go on
'to plan. W-hen welsay black now
we mean not only color but cul-
ture."

Baraka added, “Being black is
not enough. We must-begin to po-
litically organize our people.”

Stanko and Ragsdale would be”
seated. Grice, however, interpret-V 
ed this vote (without counting) as 
being against "the students and, af- i V “
ter some grumbling by other 
members, he called for the final{7

"stand—up” vote.

According to Rev. Donald‘Mc-_7f7f
Illvane, who was fired as head of ‘  
the election committee three  33
weeks ago by Grice, “The election’. ' 
,has been stolen from Ragsdalef 
and Stanko. They were fairly 

elected and it’s a definite bias
against the students.”

Mcllvane pointed out two 7A'ex:—

commission:

candidate in the Dec. 2 election

an incumbent, should never have

the resolvement of the electionf

dispute,” said Mcllvane.

Another area of bias, he said, ,7
was in regard to the appointing of:
Charles to head the e1e,ction,com‘_-_ ..
mittee. “She’s entitled to her own‘ 

opinion, but the fact that Mrs};-
_Charles had previously expressed ‘

her disapproval of "any students_:-,_j
voting in the Model Cities elec-gf._
tion, indicates that an unjust de_'- _

-cision was made.”

Mcllvane later stated that with_-es,
the students voting this year there;
was “the best election turn-out...

that we have ever had.”

, “To be quite frank,” he s,aid,l.':*
“the students ought to go to couH_rty_‘_

  Angelou Brilliant, Humorous

by KAREN BURGIO

gsj “People don’t come from the.

 ground like grass, they come from
f the ground like trees; they have
. roots” (West African proverb).

T "It’s wonderful to say thanks a
.;lot. but no thanks. It’s better to

Q than to crawl for 200 years.”

I .

When the white woman succeeds
-»in her struggle, then we (black

(women) can come together as.

 friends.”

I I spent a highly enjoyable hour
glistening to these words come
from ’a middle—aged, brilliant

I black woman poet, Maya Angelou.

I ‘_ Angelou spoke on Thursday noon A
, in-the Student Union Ballroom to '

,T a, disappointinly small audience on

f .r“The Black Woman in Society.”

5. _7,Dressed in a muted blue and
,0 black print matching jacket, long

skirt and gele, Angelou gave dra- I
gmatic _interpretations of her own

 works as well as those of other

, noted black poets—Ann Spencer,
U_'G‘eorgie Johnson, Janey Cortez,
 and Caroline_ Rodgers.

Some of the most interesting as-

I pects of Angelou’s presentation
7_,,were her stories of the charac-

 ters who motivated her to write

 poetry, her personal experiences,

_;..and the ethnocentrism of black
,women.

 Wayne State University is plan-

fning to construct a series of eth-

~=ni”c "or nationality rooms on the

/{Detroit campus, similar to those’
-there at the University.

- .7" Wayne State’s President George
Cullen -and his wife, and Mrs.

'iKatheri,.1e Gribbs (wife of the ma-

yor of Detroit) were among the

:,,officials who visited Pitt’s Na-V
 ipnality Rooms Thursday.

./“They visited our rooms to ob-

 tain information which will help
.’j_them in determining their model

“Only peers can make friends.‘

She spoke of strategies which
kept the black people "in line” for _
so many years, and of some'
blacks, like an old lady on a New
York City bus, who said (in the
words of Angelou poem), “I laugh
until I start crying, until I think

"st"eT1_<l"'straight for five minutes i aboutmysemn

 

MAYA ANGELOU

The poet spoke also of her ex-
perience as a singer, traveling

with an operetic group through .

Europe and North Africa. Al-
though she has no formal train-
ing,‘ her short rendition of a spir-
itual taught to her by her grand-
mother, left me amazed at‘ the
woman’s talent—and humor.

“When we ‘reached Morocco,”

.Woyne State University to
-Construct Ethnic Rooms

for the proposed rooms,” isaid
Maxine Bruhns, the University’s

. director _of the Nationality Class-

room Program and Office of Cul-
tural and International Exchange.

Bruhns added, “Detroit has ex-
pressions of interest from nearly
30 ethnic groups of the plan.

“This project -is another reflec-
tion of research and interest in
the multi-ethnic heritages of
Americans. We feel it is a*very
positive expression,” said Bruhns.

song. So I told the back up they
wouldn’t be needed, and proceed-
ed to sing my spiritual, after
which 4,500 Arabs stood and ap-
plauded. You haven’t really trip-
ped until you've heard 4,500 Arabs
singing a spiritual. It proves that
real people can be united across
oceans, centuries, ages, and gen-
ders.

In a short question and answer
period, Angelou was asked about
black womens’ liberation. She re-
marked that the black woman
has never had one problem of the
white woman — that of not being
needed by her spouse.

She maintained that “only peers
can make friends; when the white
woman has succeeded in her
struggle, then we can come to-
gether as friends,”_and__the libera-
tion movement will ‘become a
more united, effective force.

Of all her relevent comments,
humor and her own poetry,” one
poem she recited, written by War-
ing Conney, seemed to me to re-
late most fully Angelou’s mess-
age: '

If she could see her brown body '

dancing under palm trees. and
and see her image in the cool,
river water, she would know she
' is beautiful;

But there are no palm trees on the
streets and dishwasher gives
black no image. ’

Walking into the Lithuanian Hall on Pittsburgh's South Side Sat-
urday night, one of my friends remarked. “Christ, I wonder how many
weddings this place has seen.” Following the arrows to the basement.
however, we came upon a scene probably not a little unlike the polka
bands and ethnic accent that are, no doubt, customary at Luthuanian
weddings.

It was an open multi-media party thrown by the year-old local or-
ganization. Pittsburgh Media. Hippies and students and high schoolers
sat talking on folding chairs and the floor, while a multi-media show
took place beyond the equipment of a band.

_ There was an especially dense gathering of people along one wall
of the long room. I could have guessed—the bar. My friends and I quick-
ly repaired to it and were served beer by an especially pretty member
of the organization. .

After a few beers and a set of good blues and rock _‘n’ roll by the
band. “Fat Sal,” I went to find someone to talk to about Pittsburgh
Free Media. Someone led to Kelly Hall. He talked about the purposes
and plans of the organization. 

They’ve been together for a year—local people may remember
the festival they did this past summer on Flagstaff Hill—and their
purpose, Hall expalined, is to bring entertainment to Pittsburgh for

free or at prices far below those of the entertainment entrepreneurs. '

They operate on a non-profit basis.

This June they plan to begin building ai5,000 member co-operative.
The membership fee will be $5, the idea being to provide entertain-
ment to the younger people of Pittsburgh at prices they can afford. He
pointed out that currently, businessmen are making fantastic profits
booking groups in Pittsburgh which many members of our “gulible”

generation attend faithfully.

Free Media does not limit themselves to bands. They are also in-
volved in scheduling films and drama. In March, they are screening
movies every Sunday in David Lawerence Hall.

The band starting up again, and the several hundred people in the
now packed room beginning to dance, Kelly and I said so-long, he tell-
ing me to be sure I made it to the free concert they were sponsoring at
Chatham College on Sunday. I said for sure. '

The evening turned out to be one of the greatest I’ve had in Pitts-
burgh. I don’t know if it was the beer, but diiring Fat Sal’s extended
third set, the Lithuanian Hall basement became a happy mass of high,
sweating, /dancing young people, and I was glad Pittsburgh Free Media
had thrown this party and glad I was there.

Sex Discrimination in the Medici

by MONICA A. CIROCCO

Elaine Bloomfield of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mission (EEOC), addressed the
Seminar in Mass Communications
Law on discrimination practices
in the broadcasting media on
Thursday.

ELAINE BLOOMFIELD of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion. ‘

Bloomfield is the former Citi-
zens’ Communication Center
(CCC) attorney, representing the
National Organization for Women
(NOW) is the “petition to deny”
case against WRC-TV in Wash-
ington,D. C.

The station, owned by the Na-
tional Broadcasting Corporation
(NBC), is charged with discrim-
ination against women under
three separate citizens’ access
headings: employment, “ascer-

_tainment,” and the “fairness doc-

trine. ”

Stations are required to submit
an annual statistical summary of
race and sex data on its em-

ployees. Bloomfield said that the
practices of WRC-TV are clearly
discriminatory: of the 89 women
employed, 65 are in clerical posi-
tions. She added that the station
failed to recruit women and
would not permit pregnant wom-
en to use their valloted sick—time
for maternity leave.

Before discussing discrimina-
tion in the “ascertainment” area,
Bloomfield explained that stations
must “define” the community in
and initiate relative program-
ming. This entails, among other
things, interviewing community
leaders. She said that WRC-TV
failed to interview, and program
for women as a significant group.

Finally, the “fairness doctrine”
provides for viewers to receive
balanced viewpoints on all is-
sues. Bloomfield stated that the
issue of “women’s role” was a
controversia, one which was not
given a balanced perspective by
the station: “Women are not
viewed as often, and when they
are it is in domestic roles,” she
emphasized. V -

She criticized NBC for using
what she called a “comparative”
method to justify its practices at
the station, stating that it refuses
further action on the grounds of
being the.“the best in the area.”

Reviewing the situation, she
said that "both conciliation and
Federal Communication Commis-
sion (FCC) arbitration have fail-
ed and WRC-TV still has its li-
cense pending a final decision.
This may be slow in coming be-
cause of the two to four year pro-
ceedings period wait.

In addition to the .“NOW vs.
WRC-TV” case, Bloomfield also
focused on various aspects of the
FCC. She noted that the FCC was
created with the idea that the air-

waves belong to the people, but
she felt that it was “not really an
agent of the public.”

She explained that the license of
a station comes up for renewal by
the FCC every three years. She
feels that the seven member com-
mission is conservative, despite
the presence of Benjamine
Hooks, the only black member,
who is starting to help minority
interests; and Charlotte Reid, the
only woman commissioner.

She cited the WLBT case as an
example. Despite the discrimina-
tion of blacks and the efforts on
their behalf by the United Church
of Christ by the station, the FCC
renewed WLBT‘s license. Bloom-
field also pointed out that Su-

preme Court Justie Berger was ,

disturbed with this action and
later took the station's license
away, calling the FCC powerless.

' Bloomfield emphasized that the
biggest problem facing citizens’
groups is that of “limited reme-
dies.” However, she cited several
possible opportunities for citi-
zens’ group access, including
Cable TV and competing applica-
tions of stations. In addition,
from the political aspect, she
noted tire Whitehead Proposal to
grant a five-year renewal of a sta-
tion’s license if it “watches and
checks” exactly what it broad-
casts. She then said that the ques-
tion was not only, one of freedom
for the stations, but how citizens
can be protected. :

As a final point, Bloomfield
brought attention to Title Seven
of the Equal Rights Act. This title
seeks “equal employment” and
enables a person who feels he or
she has been discriminated
against to file charges; groups
may also file, on the basisof stat-
istic/al evidence.

Vitarelli observed that- the
“electronic equipment in China is
in no way comparable to Ameri-
can equipment. Peking TV broad-
casts only three hours a. day and
that is pure propaganda.”

At one point in his stay in China.
Vitarelli found himself alone for a
few hours and slipped out of his
hotel and took a private tour of
Shanghai. As he walked down the
back streets of the city, he report-
ed that people watched him and
looked at him as if he were an
oddity.

Some of his hours in Chinawere
more humorous. One year ago
from the date of the dinner (Feb-
uary 22. 1972), Vitarelli was with
his crew at the Great Wall of
China. One of the technicians had
somehow carved the names of the
TV staff into the Wall. At that

desire to carve the letters of his - 
college fraternity (Phi Delta The- ' I 
ta) into the Wall. But as he wisely 
pointed out, "if I had I probably 

  

In addition to directing the live _
coverageof Nixon’s trip to China,  
Vitarelli has also directed many
other firsts in television. - 7

Some of Vitarelli firsts were:
the longest continuous coverage 
of any running story (1964 Civil 
Rights Hearings-—607 hours, four. 
minutes, 47 seconds), the Telstar

 Put The Activities  
   Fee To Work

7 (The activities fee. it seems. is being used for everything
xcept student ac.tivities. It is being used to finance student
emuneration, part of the centrex phone system, and it has been
suggested that it be used to finance a new campus bus or used

iilfori renovating the Student Union.
 While these expenditures indirectly effect student activ-

ties, they may not be what students had in mind when they. voted
or the fee in last November’s referendum.

, -_There is, however, a possible solution to this dilemma_. The
gfee. can be used for all of these purposes if it is used wisely.

‘ f’-Every year there is a surplus which ranges between $20.-
00 ‘and $40,000. This excess can be invested carefully and used
Pito generate more income.

,' ‘/With the approval of the Board of Trustees, a certain pro-
ion of the fee can beltransfered to the office of the treasurer of
he University and invested in existing University endowments.
tudent Government would receive a return on a per share

The moneyiwould be used to bolster weaker University in-
estments and would eliminate the expense of hiring a broker or
finance manager to handle the investment. , -

 A return of $5,000 to $6,000 can be expected from a wise in-
;y_estment of $25,000. This return could be re-invested along with
‘nadditional fee surpluses. , .

.7 Over a period of years it might be possible to abolish the fee;
ltogether’ and allow students activities to rely on the revenues
Generated, by this investment. ' '
;_Perhaps the fee could be continued and the investment re-
urns could be used for such purposes as remunerations -for stu-.

elated to student activities-

. I If student activities were able to function without charging
activities fee, it would eliminate the insecurity by a quad-
ennial referendum on the activities fee. .

 It is ridiculous to let this money vzegetate in Student Gov-
‘:rnm_,ent"s account when it .could be put to work to solve finan-
fia-lg problems in the student activities program.

Letters to the Editor

Enough IS Enough
Editor, The Pitt News:

Since beginning this semester.
I have observed your cartoon
sketch "Gremlin Village" with
something less than enthusiasm.
But enough is enough. I get the
point that Mr. Mater does not like
President Nixon. Some of his car-
toons comparing the President
with Hitler, or depicting him as
an absolute dictator are utterly
hilarious. If Mr. Mater were
knowledgable enough to have read
about Hitler I don’t think even he
would make this comparison.

I disagree with his point of view,
but Mr. Mater‘ has a right to ex-
press his viewpoint. This he has
done week after week. The fact is,
I am tired of his degradation of
someone that I respect. There are
many students that agree with me,
but the difference is that we do not
have an outlet to express our
views such as Mr. Mater does.

Mr. Mater has let his dislike of
the President be known, now I
think it’s time that he either mov-
ed on to something more relevant
or be a little more realistic in his
criticism.

John A. Burgan

Proud of Pitt

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this letter as a
concerned student of the Univer-
sity. I have livedin Pittsburgh for
most of my" life and attended Pitt
for four years. I will graduate in
April, 1973.

I was quite surprised when I

‘ read the article “Pitt Gets Bum

Rap" by Ralph Dean in the Feb.
19 issue. This is the first time
since I have gone to Pitt that I
have been made aware of our
“negative prestige."

Anytime I have ever told a
stranger that I go to Pitt, I seem-
ed to get a positive ‘ response.
From what I have seen, even
while in Arizona for eight months
last year, most people I meet re-
act positively towards Pitt.

We cannot move from Oakland,
which is a situation that many
other large universities in a city
suffer. (ile. Temple.) I do not
think it is necessary for our pub-
licity director to go out and brag

 UAR

by PHIL KERYAN
UAR Editor

In the next few days, the Under-
graduate Academic Review
(UAR) books will be distributed
around campus. As some students
may or may not know. the edi-
torial policy of the UAR was
changed for this year. Under the
new policy. every professor that
had his, her course evaluated was
given the opportunity to see the
results of the evaluationand then
decide whether he) she wanted it
published in the book. This policy

1 was instituted in the hope of sur-

veying more courses and print-
ing more evaluations. As a result
of the policy. this past term the
UAR evaluated twice as many
courses and is printing 17 per cent
more courses in the book. It was
also hoped that such a policy
would help the UAR gradually
gain faculty acceptance of its
method of evaluation. so that
someday the UAR may survey all
courses by faculty choice.

Research in the field of psy-
chological measurement by Dr.

about higher admission standards
and possible Ivy League status
(deal big! ). I would also like to
see how people would react to our
professors wearing academic
gowns.

The article by Dean seemed to
be his over reaction to losing his
coed from East Stroudsburg. If
Dean loses his school spirit (as he
claims) because a girl leaves him.
then I feel he should transfer to
Amherst as he mentions at the,
end of his article.

If I have misread anything in
Dean’s article, I would like for
him to explain it to me and my
classmates. '

I am proud of being a student at
Pitt, and I don’t like to see people
picking at f'laws that are easily
overlooked. Especially, when most
of these flaws are not so bad to
most of our students.

As Dean states in his article. we :
should “speak -proudly” of .our
school. I don’t think we “speak
proudly” by saying we attend Am— _
herst.

Greek Charity

Editor. The Pitt News:

Greek Week is more than char-
iot races, fun night, and a formal.
This year it means Greeks work-
ing together within the commun-
ity' to raise money for the Nation-
211 Kidney Foundation.

The purpose of the National Kid-
ney Foundation is to educate the
public regarding kidney diseases
and early detection methods. to
aid those people afflicted with kid-
ney disease, ‘award fellowship
grants in the hopes that new
breakthroughs will be discovered,
and para-medical personnel in the
newest advances.in kidney treat-
ment, alleviate the staggering
medical costs by establishing a
._Drug Bank program) and estab-
fish a detection program in
schools and hospitals.

Seventy-five per cent ‘of the
money collected during this drive
will stay in the Pittsburgh area.
Dave Bako and Sallee‘Tabachnik,
the co-chairmen of the project,
hope that everyone will support
the Greeks int_this‘worthy cause.

Policy

Grace Lazovik, head of the Cen-
ter of the Improvement of Teach-
ing, has given the UAR a reliable
means ‘of measuring student opin-
ion of teaching. Thus the UAR
contains ‘reliable information on
many aspects of teaching in the
courses it surveyed. Data perti-
nent to the course itself is pre-
sented, along with the course re-
quirements. Used and interpreted
correctly, valid opinions and ex-_
pectations about a course and/or
professor can be drawn from the
information presented in the book.
Such information be useful when
registration begins. In addition to
survey information, there are sev-
eral articles in the beginning of
the book that may make interest-
ing reading.

When the books come out. it
may difficult to get one at the dis-
tribution points on campus. There
will be a supply in the UAR office.
412 Student Union. available on
March 5. As we are funded by the
activities fee. the books are avail-
able for no charge. '

Thanks From UFW

Editor. The Pitt News:

we of the staff of the Pittsburgh
office of the United Farm Workers

would like to extend to the Pitt-

News our appreciation for the
thorough and sensitive way in
which your newspaper has been.
covering the struggle between the
United Farm Workers and the let-
tuce growers. Your coverage of
Cesar Chavez’ recent visit to
Pittsburgh was particularly well
done.

The battle in which we are pre-
sently engaged can only— be won if
the entire nation is made aware
of the issues at stake. Although
the ‘media in general has been
quite uncooperative, the recent
coverage by the Pitt News has
helped us bring our message to
thousands of people in this area.

We would like to remind read-
ers that we are a small group
fighting giant conglomerates, and
we need all the help we can get. If
anyone can help us hand out leaf-
lets and picket A&P stores, we
would be most appreciative of the
assistance. Anyone who wishes to

help can telephone us at 362-9394.‘.

‘We’re operating near Pitt and in
;all areas of Pittsburgh, so people
-can help in any location.‘

Many thanks for your support
and excellent coverage of the is-

POWS Not Heroes

Editor. The Pitt News: A

Isn't it strange. the way we wel-
come the returning POW's as he-
roes. Before being shot down. they

were killing scores of people by I

remote control from their million
dollar flying machines.

Obviously the men _are wary,

criminals—as are we all.

Accept them? Yes, but as fellow A

guilt sharers in this madness,‘ not
as heroes.

Furthermore, their survival as

POW’s was largely a matter of hu- -

mane treatment by their captors,
not due to some super human part
of their military characters.

The real prisoners of this war
are the men who were forced to
leave America to avoid killing for‘
the government. ' I

In a short story written in 1901.
Willa Cather described the Schen-
ley Hotel as a  ; ..warm lighted
building, an exotic, tropical world
of shiny surfaces and basking
ease." Shedescribed the “
mysterious ‘dishes that were
brought into the dining room,
the green bottles in buckets of
ice . the fairy world of a
Christmas pantomine.”

In the fall of 1972, the Dean
of Student Affairs at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh said of the
same edifice, “It’s a dump.”

The glory of one of the finest
and most famous of the palace
hotels of the late 19th and early
20th century has indeed faded.

The once plush, mirrored ball-
room, with its old crystal chande-
liers, is now occasionally graced
with a visit of an amazing
magician,‘ an allocations hearing
or a career seminar. ~

In the lobby the marble pillars
are plastered with posters an-
nouncing the Panther basketball
schedule, Greek Week, or the
visit of a celebrity.

The first floor, contains the
freshly painted and carpeted office

of Student Affairs. The rest of’

the building houses faculty and
student organization offices,

still furnished with broken chairs,

frayed carpet and rusty green
wastebaskets with the. words,

Woodrow Wilson" was a guest
at the Schenley in his nationwide

campaign to gain support for the

League of Nations. ‘

In addition to /hosting famous
guests, the Schenley contributed
to the development of the city

of Pittsburgh by forming the nu-~.

cleus of the Civic Center.

The site was originally a‘ cow
pasture owned by Mary Crog-

‘han Schenley when the hotel was’

One witty
student claims that the Oakland
area still smells like it stepped

The property- was originally
owned by Penn _. heir Edward
Smith and was sold to General
James O’Hara. It descended to
Mary O’Hara Croghanand finally
to Mary CroghanSchenley.

Nicolo wanted ' to build a

Schenley’s Fading Glory Speed

palace-style hotel as the corner
stone of a Pittsburgh civic cen-
ter. At that time all of the cultur-
al activity was centered around
Market Square downtown.

The palace-style was the climax
of a long period of development
in American architecture. A per-
son could live like a prince amid
marble halls, potted palms
elegant silver and china and the
finest food and wines. if he had
the means.

To realize his dream Nicolo
formed the Bellefield Corporation
with H.C. Frick, Andrew Car.-
negie, George Westinghouse and

H. J. Heinze among the original '

56 stock holders.

When the Schenley opened in

1898 an advertisement‘ in the
Pittsburgh Bulletin declared,
“This fabulous hotel is now
open. In richness of furnishment,
extreme beauty of decoration,
perfection of cuisine, and in all
that rendersja hotel desireable
to the most exclusive class, the
Schenley challenges comparison
with any hotel in the country.”

The fabulous hotel was sur-

rounded by a pasture, a meadow

_ and a co'rn.field. The only other

buildings in the neighborhood
were the Carnegie Music Hall
and the Phipps Conservatory.

In 1907, Mrs. Schenley died

in London and Nicolo purchas-

ed Schenley farms. He began

-introducing clubs and churches

in the area and began shifting
the center of culture from Mar-
ket Square to Oakland.

He carved the area- into three
districts, one for public buildings,
one for a residential area, and
the hillside north of Fifth Avenue
for the University of Pittsburgh.

In 1922 Nicolo added the
Schenley , Apartments, v‘ which
now serve as University
mitories.

Sailing Club SeeI<s Funds

by DAVE MAJERNIK

The Pitt Sailing Club is apply-
ing to the Student Government Al-
locations Committee for funds and
like many of those organizations.
the success or failure of the Sail-
ing Club’s future programs de-
pends on these allocations.

According to Terry Oates, grad-
uate coordinator, the Sailing Club
is asking for $1,600 to buy either
two large boats or three smaller
boats,

Last season the club was forced
to depend, for crafts, upon the
generosity of Pitt faculty and stu-
dent boat owners at Lake Arhtur
in Moraine State Park near ‘But-
ler. Also, the Red Cross allowed
the club to use their sail boat fa-
cilities on the north shore of Py-
matuming Lake.

The Sailing Club was started
last spring when the Red Cross
gave a sail boat and water safety
presentation at the Student Union.

All those who signed up for the
Red Cross program were con-
tacted as well as known campus
sailing enthusiasts. According to
Terry Oates, Jack»Brown of Stu-
dent Activities was also very help-
ful. in organizing the club and ob-
taining funds.

Activitids last summer included

dry land training sessions for be-
ginners taught by Maury Eggers
(a graduate student in Computer
Science), weekends at Pymatum-
ing and Lake Arthur, and a La-
bor Day weekend cruise with
C-MU students on a chartered

boat in the Chesepeake Bay. Sev-

eral weeks ago, the Sailing Club
sponsored an ice boating excur-
sion on Lake Arthur.

Oates said that the club plans
to buy three MacDinghies. boats
often used for racing. Several
dealers have been contacted and
they are all willing to see] these
boats to the club at cost ($550) for
promotional reasons, he said.

Another alternative, said Oates. ,

is to buy two Ghost 13 boats for
around $800. The final decision
will be made by a vote of the
membership.

He added, “It is expensive to
rent boats. Last summer we spent
$500 on rentals alone.

If the boats are purchased, the
Sailing Club plans to offer more
dry land training and also daily
sailing practice on the Allegheny
‘River. ‘

“The best program is to learn
a,little, go out and practice it,

learn a little. more and practice '

that,” said Oates. “You cannot

by GEORGE GORMAN

Jim Bouton'joined WABC-TV’s “Eyewitness
News” in New York as a sports correspondent
with his first book, Ball Four, high on the best-
seller list; his name a controversy in the sports
world. He reports on sports with “more humor,
more perspective, and the realization that sports

. are not the most important thing in the world.”

,. He will speak in the Duquesne University Union

Ballroom tomorrow night at 8.

As a Yankee, Bouton won 21 games in 1973 and
18 games and two world series games in 1964. ,

Prior to writing, he had lost his winning pitch

Bouton says, “I’d go three and two on a hitter

learn by just being on a boat with-

offer a little of both.“

The Allegheny River near Oak- "

mont, although it is not clean, is a
viable place to sail, according to
Oates.

“Sailing nearby in the Allegheny
River will eliminatethe two hour
trip to the nearest lake and make
it possible for Sailing Club mem-
bers to be on the water daily."
said Oates.

The club plans another excur-
sion on Chesepeake Bay during
the Memorial Day weekend.

Also, the club wants to cooper-
ate with the C-MU Sailing Club.

“With C-MU’s three MacDing-
hies and two of our own, we could
have a pretty decent regatta,"
said Oates.

In the more .distant future
(about a year), the Sailing Club
hopes to enter the Midwest Col-
legiate Sailing Association. said
Commodore George Rosenberg.
This -conference of about 20
schools sponsors one or two regat-
tas each week during the season,
said Oates.

Another planned activity. ac-
cording to Rosenberg. is to have
individual competition between
Pitt and C-MU students who own
Kool boats; one-person. stirofoam
boats. . ‘

by BARB GERAUD
Rock Critic

I‘m sitting here watching Dick
Cavett. trying to figure out how
to write a review of the Jim
Croce, George Carlin concert this
past Friday night without sound-
ing like an over-the-hill, gushing
teenybopper, and it ain‘t easy.

Quite simply, Croce moved me
more than any other artist I’ve
ever seen — from Stones to Kinks
to Yes to Poco to James Taylor to
Carole King to anybody—nobody
can put across a song the way he
can.

He feels. He writes songs based
on his own experiences — every-
thing from “Operator” to “Speed-
ball Tucker” (about a truck driv-
er who takes a “west coast turn-
around” — type upper — he’s the
“terror of the highway”) to one
of his newest (and best, in my
book) “These Dreams,” about
“lonely people, trying to forget
each other’s names.” (It’s also
one of Jim’s favorites.)

There’s even one called “I fell
in love with a Roller Derby
Queen,” which has to be heard to
be believed. There were a few
from the first album, but more
were new ones.

An intense young man, he has a
way of condensing feelings into
remarkably compact lyric lines,
all accompanied by some decep-
tively simple accompaniment that
isn’t as seimple as it seems. Per-
haps the fact that he was a psy-
chology/English major at Villa-

gnova accounts for his understand-

ing and his poetic ability, (He felt
that college “totally prepared me
for life in the 12th century.”)

“I try to touch on emotions,” he
said, and he does. He went through

a long period where he neither‘

wrote nor played in public, be-
cuase of disenchantment with
“show-biz”—his first album (en-
titled simply Croce, and produced
by Tommy West and Terry Cash-
man) went nowhere, and touring.
is a drag if nobody knows who you
are.

During that time, he held many
different jobs — everything from
truck driving (“when you feel
like God up there in that rig, 12

feet off the ground"). to writing

and performing commercials for ,

a Philadelphia R&B station, to
the Army (they, didn’t get along
too well, but if we ever have to
defend’ our country with mops,
Jim says he’ll be there), to teach-
ing education to high school kids,
where he didn’t get along with the

‘heirarchy because he believed in

teaching the kids to read using
song lyrics, which was a no-no.

These all came out in the
lengthy intros to various songs
and the anecdotes between them.
Although Jim insists he isn’t a
com_edian, his monologues were
much more interesting, relevant,
and humorous than Carlin’s.

There was an intimacy establish- '

ed between he and his lead guitar-
ist, Maury Muehleisen, and the
audience, until it was as if we
were all sitting around‘ a fire-
place exchanging stories and fun.

He even gave us an old Robert
Burns “Bawdy Song,” complete
with brogue, about certain go-
ings on at a Scottish castle one
weekend long ago. An orgy, in-
volving rose hips, aphrodisiacs
and everyone- in town from the
major to the minister to the town
cripple getting their jollies. The
lyrics—all nine verses—were in-
credible, though “unprintable.”
But it showed another facet of his
varigated talent.

Perhaps it’s Croce’s voice that
makes him so special~—it.’s rough,
though melodic, capable of going
from “Don’t Mess Around with
Jim” to “There Ain’t Gonna Be a
Next Time,” with sincerity in
both. You can tell he feels what
he writes and sings about.

I talked to Jim for about 20 min-

utes after his set and came away
even more impressed than the
show had left me. He didn’t drop
any magnificent pearls of wis-
dom or spiritual platitudes that I
could quote you here—the talk
was on just about everything
from soap operas to touring-
but I. was convinced more than
ever that this man is truly some-
thing.

He’s been around—“paid his
dues” (although he doesn’t like
that expression; he prefers to call
it “lived”)—and knows where he’s
going if he can ever get off tour-
ing. He likes time to himself, but
doesn’t, get it too often and is
looking forward to some R&R.

Jim’s second album is due out
any day now, and he has material
he’s working on for a third. If
they’re one quarter asgreat as his
show or he is, they’ll be beyond 90

. per cent of what’s out today. He’ll
be back at the Mosque on March
13 with Loggins and Messina, and
if you can possibly go, do so. See;
ing Jim will be worth the entire
cost of the ticket. I

(P.S.: George Carlin headlined,

the show, but appeared to be ston-
ed out of his head and rambled for
most of the hour and a half he was
on stage. He was funny (and much
-more blunt than he is allowed to
be on records), but I would rather
have played an album. He just
wasn’t together, though maybe
the audience was stoned enough to
follow him. I wasn’t.

Caligula Presented by

Pittsburgh Poor Players

Albert Camus‘ Caligula is a re-
markable play. It has a special
appeal among actors because it is
the story of strong and clearly in-
dividual characters in a bizarre
struggle against a man who chal-
lenges every human value, includ-
ing the truths by which_civilized
man reasons his right to live and
seek happiness.

And because the events of this
modern tragedy are often ludi-
crously comic, but ultimately
calamitous, the director may be-
lieve this play was written as a
showcase for his talents. But be-
cause Camus is a moralist, and a
conscientious playwright as well,
Caligula is a play for the specta-
tor. Few plays in modern reper-

toire can so challenge and reward

an audience as Caligula.

Despite these -attractions, the
play is seldom staged in this coun-
try. The Pittsburgh Poor Players
have therefore decided to present
Caligula in a continuing effort to
provide the city of Pitttsburgh
with unusual theatrical produc-
tions.

The play concerns the young
Caius Caligula Caesar, ' Emperor
of Rome, who returns from his
sister’s burial with a new realiza-
tion of the power of death. Be-
cause.all life is death’s victim,

all life.is equal in the eyes ofdeath.

Which is to say, Caligula reasons,
that life has no value. This lesson
he must teach to his people, and
how to live with honor in such a

universe is the lesson he must 2

learn for himself.

Caligu1a's own yearning to be
free of death’s meaningless at-
tacks is nothing more than an en-

slavement of his friends and sub- '

jects. who eventually conquer
their fear and revolt against him.
Caligula dies knowing he has done
great evil, but -knowing, too, that

he has helped his fellows to over- .

come their fear of death. In slay-

.ing him, they win a new freedom 3 

for themselves.

The Pittsburgh Poor Players is  I
an independent non-profit theater "
company which is makingits con- —

tribution to the cultural life of

Pittsburgh, according to its belief‘
in the popular theatre as an art 6

form for everyone. This in effect
means inexpensive theatre. Every
member of the group is a volun-
teer and interested parties who
would like to work for the grou

are invited to contact it.  ‘

  “America's"   Art Displciyecl 

by BARB GERAUD
Rock Critic

There were times during last
Wednesday‘s America concert
when I almost wished Crosby.
Stills. Nash & Young had never
existed. For despite the fact that
America is one of the best live
groups around. they’re going to

be stuck with the CSN&Y label."

and it’s a shame.

They were utterly great. Kick-
ing off with “Riverside" and
working theiriway through "Head
and Heart." “Don’t Cross the
River," “Til the Sun Comes Up
Again." "Never Found the
Time." and—of course—"Horse
With No Name” and "Ventura
Highway," they displayed some
of the tightest and airiest har-
monies this side of heaven. (Nev-
er having been to heaven, I can‘t
speculate on what kind of bar-
monies are sung there, but if and
when I do get there, I hope the
angels sound like America.)

Unfortunately, they tend to
sound like Crosby & Co., but
they‘ can’t help it; it’s just the
way they are. But, unlike their

I more famous counterparts, they
.didn’t sing flat on every other
,number. In fact, they were only

/slightly off once, ‘during “Sand-
man,” because they had trou-
ble getting adjusted to the elec-
tric setup.

 Knight-marish Afternoon

  Dims Lions’j NIT Hopes

by,BART MACK

A's Billy Knight goes, so goes the-Pitt basket-
ball team. Even a one legged Billy Knight that is.

Knight sustained. a severely bruised calf in the
loss to Virginia and was listed as a doubtful starter
for the game at State College Saturday. Knight did
start, and even though his lateral movement and
jumping abilities were hampered by his lame leg.
he came on to power the hoopsters to their second
victory over Penn State this season by the score of
58-49.

utes of the first half had expired. Led by Jonathan
Marshall and Ed Chubb, the Nittany Lions used
their man to man defense to stop the Panthers. and
Knight, from capitalizing on the early lead. L

Knight broke into the scoring column with 10:22

-gone in the half to cut the Penn State lead to‘13-10.

At exactly the midway point of the initial frame.
Kirk Bruce was ejected from the game after the

referee rules that he had commited a flagrant fou‘l-

that cut Penn State’s Ron Brown on the face, leav-
ing him bleeding profusely. Brown went after
Bruce immediately following the foul but cooler
heads prevailed and" Brown went to the Penn State
bench for repairs.

Tom Doaty took a pair of shots at the foul line
for Brown but only made one. running the Penn
State lead to 14-10. “Mooney“ Knight then stepped
forward to show the 6,200 screaming fans that pack-
ed Rec'Hall just what he could do on one leg;

‘Knight grabbed an offensive rebound and sand-
wiched a pair of baskets in between a Chubb basket

to tie things up at.16'-16. Carl Morris sunk two bas- _

kets and Mickey Martin layed one up from under-
neath to give Pitt a 22-18 lead with-5:17 leftin the
half.

Knight picked up sixmore points and Morris hit
on another jumper to pace Pitt to a 30-22 halftime
lead. . » 7

The second half started where the first had left
off—with Knight pumping in two more. With Pitt
infront, 32-22, the tide began to turn against the
Cats. Marshall and Chubb exchanged baskets with
Lucius Keese and Keith Starr but the Cats turned
sloppy and lapsed into foul trouble.

Kevin Burke brought the Nittany Lions to with-
in three at‘38-35, and stormed to 42-41 with only 10
minutes left in the contest. It would be the closest
Penn State would come to victory, however, as Pitt
rallied to extinguish what might be the Nittany

Keese, Knight, Morris, and Ken Wagoner com-
bined to rebuild the Pitt lead and with 3:02‘, remain-
ing in the game the Cats had some breathing room.
47-41. Keese was called for goaltending on a Brown
layup and the Nittany Lions were back to within
fourpoints.

Pitt then went into a ball control offensive and
began a stall, forcing Penn State to foul in order to

regain possession of ‘the ball. The Nittany Lions.

picked the wrong man to foul, Keith Starr. and the

freshman came through at the charity stripe in fine

fashion.

Starr sunk three of four chances to put in some

n of the Cat’s’most crucial points. Knight sunk six

more to run his final total to -27, and Pitt coasted
comfortably to a victory over the Lions. -~

Pitt’s win gave the Cats the sweep of this sea-
son’s two game series. It marks the first time in

four years that either team took the series. The loss_

was the first at Rec Hall for the Nittany Lions this
year and only the second win for Pitt on the road.

by a mere half point. In the end
Pitt missed fourth place by two
and one-half points. trailing 75 to
Lehig.h‘s 7812.

‘‘It’s definitely the best we’ve
wrestled all season,” rasped Dave
Adams, whose voice was raw
from two days of screaming. His
Panthers qualified five grapplers
for the Nationals at Seattle.

“I'm a bit disappointed. I feel
we could have gotten second place
with a few breaks." said perfec-
tionist Adams. “I'm not disap-
pointed in the kids. they did a
great job. I just think we could
have finished higher."

The Cats advanced two men —
freshman Jeff Minerd and senior
Craig Tritch—-into the finals. and
Tritch came on to edge Navy's
Jeff Simons for the 190 pound
crown.

Two other Panthers, Geroge
Bryant and John Chatman, shook
off early upset losses and hung in
through the grueling series of
consolation matches to finish
third at 118 and 158 pounds. Pitt’s

.0ther qualifier, Bob Been, 4-6-2

during the season, pulled a tourna-
ment shocker of sorts ,by finish-
ing fourth at 134.

John Buzzato. an early. hopeful
for the 150 title, was pinned in the
semi-finals by Ray Sarinelli of
Penn, to windup fifth——out of
NCAA consideration.

The final matches got underway
Saturday night, and the capacity
crowd wasn't shortchanged as
three bouts were decided in over-
time; Penn State was roundly
rooted against as the arch villain,
and at times it seemed the fans
from Lehigh occupied the entire
Field House.

Mike-Frick, Lehigh’s All-Amer-
ican 118 pounder, gave them
something to scream about in his
monumental showdown with Tom
Teagarden.

In one of the inost exciting bouts
in years, Frick“ came back from a

Teagarden twice and knot the

The Pitt swimmers finished up their season in a
burst of glory and managed to reach their first win-
ning season in six years by beating Carnegie—Mellon
by, a score of 102-9 and Youngstown by a score of
68-45 at Trees Hall pool last Saturday. '

The Youngstown Penguins were the only team‘
to give the Cats any sort of competition as the C-MU

Tartans only -entered one swimmer in each event

and didn’t even enter two of the races.

The Panthers were in top form as they cap-
tured nine first places in 13 events.

“It was, the most spirited meet we competed
in,” said Dick Bradshaw. “The swimmers really
brought the crowd to its feet in what had to be one
of our best meets this year.”

The meet started off with Pitt taking first
place in the medley relay with a time of 3:47. and
Jim Howell was able to manage a second place in

_. the 1000-yard freestyle race. ‘Ed Wade of Youngs-

town won that event.

Dave Simeone came back to; win the 200-yard
freestyle race, and Dave Natali picked up third
place in that event for the Cats.

’Jim Tatsch of Youngstown edged out Mark Wal-
lace for first place by one-tenth of a second in the
50-yard freestyle race with a time of 22.4 with Des
Nunan of Pitt taking third place.

Ron Bokulic won the 200-yard individual medley
and Mark Winters copped second place in the eyent
as Bokulic continued to show added strength since
the beginning of the season. Al Landis of Youngs-
town took third place in that race.

Jack Garrow won the one—meter diving event,
and Jeff Miller took third place as John Muchorski
of Youngstown grabbed second.  1

Dave Natali won the 200-yard butterfly, beating
Don, Neckert and Dennis Hamrick from Youngs-
town. Natali qualified for the Easterns in the Grove
City meet. ‘ _

Mark Wallace grabbed first place in the 200-

Blast T artan, Penguins

yard backstroke, the event for which he qualified
for the Easterns. Ed Cahill took second in the race
with Mark Nelenuis of Youngstown edging out Jeff
Sharer for third place.

John Templin had a tough competitor in Avi
Werhudia of Youngstown but kept his undefeated
streak alive by finishing a second ahead of Werhu—
dia. Templin has also qualified for the Easterns and
may still have a chance to qualify for the NCAA’s
when he competes in the Easterns.

The divers swept all three places in the three-
meter event with Jack Garrow taking first, Jeff
Miller, second, and Dave Conrad, third.

C-MU did not pick up any places in the entire
meet as the Panthers finished off their season with
a rout of both teams.

“The team has progressed quite a bit since the
beginning of the season," said Bradshaw. “We are
sending four swimmers and four divers to the East-
erns and that is quite an accomplishment."

Seeing action in both Madison
Square Garden and Ohio State this
weekend the Pitt tracksters fared
well in New York and only "aver-
age" at Ohio State.

Bill Rea placed third in the long
‘jump at the National AAU’s held
in New York. Competing against
the Olympic champion Randy Wil-
liams and world standout Norm
Tate, Rea did exceptionally well,
measuring 25.51/2. The winning
jump was only 26.71/2.

Chuck Mozingo and Rich Jack-
son also made the trip to New
York, competing in the 440. While
both never made the finals, Jack-
son made it to the semis. They
were competing against the “top
quarter milers in the country, ac-
cording to coach Don Mollenauer.

Ohio State is a story in two
parts. Friday night was “disas-
terous” and Saturday was a “de-
cent job/“according to Mollen-
auer. '

The distance medley relay took
third with a 10.13. Ken Silay ran
the opening leg with ,a 1.55, Ted
Bobby ran-the second leg, Rich

Markley bogged down the third, ‘

/. and by the time Bob Steele took

‘the stick Ohio State and St. J ohn’s
were out in front.

"Bob O’Neil ran his speciality,

Nick Martin ran the mile run in

._iPa'gel12—lTHlE PITT NEWS——Monday,'”February 26, 1973

“I started out in gymnastics as
a freshman in high school. I
couldn‘t even do a cartwheel
then.“ admits Anne thinking back
to the days when she attended Es-
sex Junction High School in Ver-
mont where she makes her home.
"We were only a club then, but by
my junior year we formed a team
and began competing state wide.
We were even state champs.”

While in high school Anne per-
‘formed in two events, the uneven
parallel bars and vaulting. "I
started on the balance beam when
Icame to Pitt.“ And Anne‘ s
strongest event now appears to be
the beam as she has taken two
first places and one third place
on beam thus far this season.

“In New England I remember

. attending gymnastics clinics held

at Springfield College and at the
Coast, Guard Academy‘ in .-New
London, Conn. They were week- "
end clinics held over‘Thanksgiv-
ing. We heard lectures, attended
demonstrations and worked out
on the different pieces of appra-
tus.”

When Anne entered Pi‘tt. the
Pink "Panthers were only in their

second season of competition. “I
did some floor exercise routines
my sophomore year, but I find
the other events easier for me’. I
feel the beam is generally the
hardest. piece of apparatus to
work on because balance is so cru-
cial. Gail (DiCicco. gymnastics
coach) really pushed to get me
started on the beam. Vaulting is
"the easiest for me. Ildo mostly
layout stoop vaults. I‘ve also done
handsprings and layout straddles.“

Besides her Monday through

Friday gymnastics practice ses- _

sions from 4 to 6 p.m., Anne some-
times runs or swims to keep in
shape. Hailing from Vermont, ski-
ing is also a part of her sports
repertoire.

Anne is in nursing and wants to
become a nurse upon graduation
from Pitt this year. She plans to
head West and hopes to land a job
in Arizona. Whenasked what will
happen to her gymnastics when
she leaves Pitt, Anne answered,
“I’d like to coach a gym team on
the side.”

This term Anne is doing nursing

work at a state hospital. She also
finds time to teach gymnastics at

‘Commence To Fence’

Another intercollegiate sport has begun at Pitt under the direc-
tion of Stella Saurer. fencing. Saurer has five competitors. four men

and one woman.

The boys are James Diamond. James Sommerville. Dave Bocks-
dace. and Gail DiPaola. The one woman is Nancy Leid.

The group competed in a tournament at Carnegie Mellon Satur-
day. and in a field that included Penn State and Allegheny College.
posted two first places. Diamond won in the men’s division. and Leid
copped first place honor in the women’s compeitition. Sommerville

made it to the semi-finals.

The group is definitely in search of more members, and coach
Saurer has said, “My; ultimate goal is for intercollegiate competi-
tion. Pitt is one of the few schools that doesn’t have a fencing team.”

The group has scheduled matches with Indiana, and also a tour- .
nament here at Pitt. Anyone interested in joining the team should
contact coach Saurer in room 104. Trees Hall.

Churchill Area High School along
with two of her teammates, Lori
Fisher and Donna Saunders. "We
teach young kids and high school
kids on Sunday nights from 7 to
10."

Anne has her own philosophy on
gymnastics. "Gymnastics can get

you really frustrated. There are I

such drastics up and downs; I hit
rock bottom at our meet with
Temple and then a week later at
Indiana I was on top. Gymnastics
is not really a true team effort

like basketball for instance. In '

gymnastics you’re out there all
