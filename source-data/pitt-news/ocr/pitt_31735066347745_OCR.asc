HearingBoard Says Reappoint Nyden

By MREA CSORBA

A University Senate Council
hearing board voted unanimously
on Friday for .the reinstatement of
ﬁred assistant professor . Paul
Nyden following an intensive
two-week study into the evaluative
procedure which terminated the
Marxist sociologist’s contract with
Pitt.

In a report ‘submitted to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, the six
member faculty panel recommend-
ed the renewal of Nyden’s initial
three-year contract,» citing the
sociology department’s improper
and uncustomary review pro-
cedures, which failed to clearly

outline for Nyden theicriteria by
which his contract would be judged

- for renewal.

The committee, requested by
Nyden and convened by Posvar,
found the department’s lack of
explicit criteria a signiﬁcant defect,
arguing that had Nyden been given
proper notice of speciﬁc standards,
he could have /concentrated on_his
professional development in the
works written here, instead of the
revision of his Columbia disserta-
tion. ’ V 7

“He (Nyden) may have directed
his efforts in a manner to better
acquit himself in the judgment of
his colleagues,” the report held.

With Budget Freeze

Assembly face threats by SGB to

-freeze their budgets.

Unly 44 of 117 undergraduate
organizations turned in‘names of
their representatives by Friday’s
noon deadline.

The assembly, which was ap-
proved by ‘referendum vote in
J anuary’s SGB election, is to consist
of one voting representative from
each organization. A clause of
SGB,’s constitution gives student
government the priviledge to freeze
group funds if representatives are

~ not chosen or if these representa-

tives accrue a record of absentee-
ism. S A
The SGB announced its '

intentions to freeze funding in

“We placed the ad because the
assembly is something voted-in" by
the students, yet we’ve received
very little cooperation from most
student orgainzations,” assembly
chairman Josh Baylson said.

The assembly, as planned, will
serve as an advisory body to SGB
and consolidate opinion of under-
graduate organizations on campus
concerning student government
policy—making. ..

“The lack of response is odd,”
Baylson said, “since the assembly
would guarantee all student\organi-
zations at Pitt a more importantrole
in student government.” The SGB
may freeze the ﬁnancial program-
ming and operational budgets “of
those groups that do not actively
participate in the assemly and do

not respond to the chairman in the

case of absenteeism.

Baylson said the decision to
freeze funds will be made at the

the faculty governing organ, the
University Senate Council, was
charged with studying and respond-
ing to seven procedural issues in the
sociology department’s evaluation
of the 31-year-old sociologist’s
work. i ‘

Though questioning the rationale
which denied’ a second review of
Nyden’s'”highly acclaimed ‘disserta-
tion while recommending Nyden’s
non-renewal on scholarly grounds,
the board sustained the integrity of

- the department during the review

procedures 14 months ago.

The failure, to give notice of
adequate criteria, however, was a
defect that” could have “materially
altered the decision” not to renew
the initial contract, according to the
board report.

‘ ‘Given our conclusions that there
exists a material procedural defect,
we unanimously believe there is no
alternative but to recommend that
Dr. Nyden receive a new appoint-
ment as an assistant p'rofessor’.’ the
report stated.

The review, conducted by ﬁve
University Senate Council members
and chaired by independent faculty
member and law professor Richard
Seeburger is Nyden’s ﬁfth evalua-
tion within the University. The
Senate hearing board is the highest
and ﬁnal grievance channel open to
Nyden for appeal of his case.

Pitt Women’/s
En rollmentr
Skyrockets

BY MARY HUZINEC.
AND BETSY NORMAN

Pitt women’s enrollment soared
in recent years while men’s
registration decreased, according to
Anne Parke, university reports and
surveys coordinator.

A 25 percent increase in female ,
enrollment and corresponding 20,

percent rise in degrees granted to
women, undergraduate through
doctoral, occurred here between the
fall terms of 1970 and 1975.

“We have not put a’conscious
effort into increasing somen’-s
enrollment," ‘associate dean of
admissions Edmund Harper said.
“The proportion in the College of
Arts and Sciences is about 50-50
between the two sexes. The
changes are in engineering for the
most part. Women are starting to
consider ﬁelds like
pharmacy and engineering rather
than just teaching and social work. ’ ’

. Although male enrollment
dropped seven percent over the past
ﬁve years, the number of degrees
granted to men increased eight
percent. The number of degrees
granted to members of both sexes,
in most categories, have shown at
least a slight increasepsince 1970.

On the national level, the number

GRE Tests Analytical Skills

A section testing analytical

demonstrate a wider range of

academic talents.

Research by the GRE board
showed analytical skills can be
distinguished from verbal and
quantitative skills and are related to
academic success. A '

Janis‘ Somerville, GRE program
director at the educational testing
service, which distributes the exam,
said the new section requires no
formal training in logic or analytical
methods.

“Analytical skills are developed
over a long period of time in most
ﬁelds of undergraduate study,”
Somerville said.

She added intensive study prior

to the taking of the test does not
improve a student's analytical skills

— significantly.

Familiarity with the type of
questions asked can be expected to
make a difference in test scores, but
students cannot be expected to

learn the “tricks-of-the-trade,”
associate director Linda Conrad
said.

Three types of questions will be
used in the analytical section-—anal-
ysis, of explanations, logical dia-

grams, and analytical reasoning
questions. -
“‘The analysis of explanations
deals with deduction and common
sense,” Conrad said. “Logical
diagrams test the ability to-

cate-gorize, while analytical rea- ‘

soning questions are often more
abstract. treating interrelated
statements without _a clear
context." ' '

test with the verbal and quantitative
sections shortened to allow time for
the analytical skills exam.

The new test is fair to students

who have taken the exam, Conrad -

said, adding no differences exist
between aptitude results of short
versus long passages on the verbal
section. The number of math
questions remains the same but
each requires less time to solve,
Conrad said.

The 1977-8 GRE Bulletin of
Information, sent free to all
students registered for the GRE,
includes questions and answers
representative of those on the
analytical skills section.‘ A sample

"71 Year: of Collegiate Joumaliain at the University of Pitaburﬁi "

Reappoint Nyden ~

The procedure an educator must go through at Pitt to receive
tenure is a process that takes years. Undeserving candidates are
weeded out on the basis of scholarship which is evaluated mainly
through an individual’s publishing record, teaching ability and ad-
ministrative accomplishments.

Paul Nyden taught here for three years and was up for tea poin-
tment for three more years when a decision was made to terminate
his teaching contract. A close look at his case and the procedural
way in which it was handled indicates that three more years of trial
are in order before any decision can be made on his qualification
for tenure. i Therefore Paul Nyden should be reappointed.

His department denied him tenure and the senior faculty voted
14-1 in support of this decision. The Dean of Faculty of Arts and
Sciences accepted these opinions and backed the termination. The
denial of reappointment has been appealed by Nyden through
various review committees on seven procedural grounds. Last
Friday, in a report to the Chancellor, the highest review in the
University Senate found support for one of Nyden’s claims and
deems this violation serious enough to interfere with his
preparation for review. ‘

The violation was so serious, they said, that Nyden should be gran-
ted a three-year reappointment and receive his final review at the
end of this time.

The violation involved the manner in which the sociology depar-
tment informed Nyden of how he would be judged in his review.
Nyden’s defense was based on the entire range of his scholarly
work; the department judged him on his more recent accomplish-
ments. -

Since Nyden was misinformed, the committee said he was unable
to adequately demonstrate why he deserved another three-year ap-
pointment. The review panel believed this mistake on the part of
the sociology department warranted reappointment for Nyden.

This review panel did decide, however, that the negative review
of his professional qualification was a sound professional
judgement. Evidently the committee felt the miscue on the part of
the sociology department outweighed this judgment and calls for
another three years for Paul Nyden. '

A decision by this committee does not automatically’ rehire Paul
Nyden. The decision rests in the hands of the Chancellor. He can
decide, after considering the report, that its arguments have merit
and Nyden should be rehired or he can disagree with it and uphold
Nyden’s contract termination.‘ ‘

Similarly, two of a student’s possiblefour years at this University
will not always indicate whether said student will be a shoe-in for
graduation when the time comes. If there are procedural defects in
the students first two years of preparation for graduation a fair
person will back away from a quick decision to see what will evolve
in four years.

Paul Nyden has completed three of six years’ preparation for a
final tenure review. There were procedural defects serious enough
during his first three years of preparation that sound judgment
cannot be made. Because of this reivew of his first three years can-
not be considered an accurate indication of his potential over the
entire six years.

Since Nyden has not been given the chance to demonstrate his
competence over the past three years, according to sociology depar-
tment criteria the Chancellor should give him an additional three
years to prove it. His six years of work should then be judged ac-
cording toproper procedure. Then, more than ever, the sociology
department should take care that his review is defect-free.

I   Letters to the Editor

Conservation: Is It Really Important?

I'd like to offer a dissenting view
to Gary Govert’s report on
President Carter’s energy package.
This comment is very general, since
none of us know what Congress will
do with Carter’s proposal.

Govert’ s commentary reﬂects the
view that .political solutions to
economic problems are not only
feasible, but apparently the best
way to achieve certain economic
objectives regardless of their
validity. Carter’s proposal is
predicated on the belief that energy
supplies are scarce, and "more
important, that the American

people can not voluntarily reduce
consumption on the basis of
information already available, i.e.
higher prices. The truth is we don't
know the full energy producing
potential of the world; new deposits
are being discovered and exploited
every day. (Recently coal was
discovered in the Iranian desert.)

But to reach these deposits we need
to dig a little further and spend a
little more money. Even the most
advanced technology can not
compensate the inevitable cost
increases of getting new energy.

Sure, we’re exploring new sources

response- to Tom WaseIeski’s
review (the Pitt News, April 26) of
Bruce Cockburn's newest album
“In the Falling Dark".

Firstly, as a Canadian, I would
like to say that I am proud to see
Canadian artists, such as Bruce
Cockbum, receiving recognition
beyond Canada's borders. ' How-
ever, Iwould hope that in reviewing
the work of Canadian artists, critics
would not lose sight of the fact that
art can only fully be understood in
the context of the land and culture
from which it stems.

One of the songs on Cockburri's
latest -album. referred to by
Waseleski as “French-ir/ifested folk
droppings". is entitled ‘Vagabon-
dage', and it is sung in French. This
is an indication of Cockburn’s
awareness of the imperative need in
Canada today to bridge the cultural
gap between the English- and
French-speaking communities.
Canada is today facing its greatest
crisis: the threat of the separation
ofthe predominantly French-speak-
ing province of Quebec. Although
he is of English-speaking origins,
Cockburns's work has always
reﬂected his desire to reach the
French-speaking people of Canada
with his songs. His last four albums
included French translations of the
lyrics. In his tourthis past winter he
visited a number of French-speak-

ing communities in the heart of
Quebec. in an effort to reach the
French-Canadian audience.

The song, ‘Vagabondage', which
Cockbum sings in French, is the
most recent evidence of his desire
for a rapprochement between the
English and the.French in Canada.
It an honest, t‘gi;l)ute_ .to. .a

French-Latin style of music, done

with a well-meaning and unabashed
rendition of the lyrics in French.

Surely Waseleski has missed the
point when he states that “the
French lyrics overweigh any
romantic effect he may have been
trying to achieve". The effect
which Cockbum obviously wished
to achieve was to reach the
French-Canadian audience, by

singingtheir song. ‘Vagabondage' '

must be interpreted as a sign of
Cockburn’s desire to communicate
with both cultures of Canada,
through his music.

Today, Bruce Cockburn's music
is being heard south of the
fortyninth parallel. But let us not
forget that Cockbum is a Canadian,
and that his music reﬂects how truly
Canadian he is, in his strivings
towards his nation's ideal of
biculturalism.

that these supplies will be any
cheaper than they are now. In other
words, to get more, you must pay
more.

Unless we are willing to have
public ownership of energy activ-
ities we should permit energy
concerns to charge as much as
necessary to earn a healthy rate of
return and expand capacity. Such
a price increase will affect all of us,
for energy is a necessity find oil, for
example, is used in many consumer
products through petrochemicals.
We will be forced to curtail our
consumption for atime, until we can
adjust our budgets to the new price
level. What I am favoring is
inﬂation now and recession now for
long-term growth later. If
conservation and new supplies is

proposal is best. Carter's notion of
“sacrifice" on the other hand is
politically desirable-make it easy as
possible for all. Carter has an image
to maintain, votes to keep. His
package clearly displays that
politicians should get out of the
economic business. But one
question puzzles me. Conservation
has been an issue for almost 80
years; is it that important?

A sidewalk stairwell leads down.

to a dimly lit-room below street level
with soiled mats strewn about the
room. Inside one hears grunts,
groans, screams, sighs and moans.
On one side of the room two vague
ﬁgures grapple with one another,
while in the other corner a young
man is attempting to break a cement
block with everything but his
backside.

Sound familiar?

Anyone who has ever had sand
kicked in his face by the
neighborhood bully has probably
visited on of these places. to learn a
martial art.

Each year more and more
Americans try their hands in the

martial arts, but many ofthem don’t '

persist in the sport more than a few
months because of the vigorous
conditioning needed.

However, there is a martial art‘

taught at the University of
Pittsburgh called Tai Chi Chuan
where the student attrition rate is
much lower. Tai-Chi Chuan is a soft
Chinese martial art taught by a
gentle Chinese man who prefers to
be called simply Mr. Chou.

Chou, an engineer,‘has been a
student of Tai-Chi Chuan for more
than 20 years. “I began Tai-Chi

,. Chuan to improve my health,” he

said. I “It improves your body
physically and mentally.”

Chou teaches the martial arts
course at Pitt during the year. When

‘ -weather is suitable during the

summer. he teaches‘ on a part-time

F  

basis at Schenley Park. “I enjoy it,
he said, “and it keeps me ‘in good
shape.” I ’
Aside from technique and some
philosophy, -the major difference
between Tai-Chi Chuan and other
martial art forms is Chou’s
emphasis on conditioning. “You
can’t learn techniques unless you’re
in condition,” ‘I he said. “Many
people get hurt if they are out of

“shape.”

That is why beginners in Chou’s
course ‘will experience very little
sparring and self-defense techni-
ques. The three-month beginner’s
course, which costs 50 dollars, is
devoted entirely to conditioning.
Chou’s advanced course introduces
sparring and self-defense.

Chou credits his conditioning
program with the success of his
classes. “Students know they must
work hard to learn Tai-Chi Chuan;’ ’
he said, “and they do.”

Chou. said he has taught many
students the art of‘ Tai-Chi Chuan
over the years and he continues to
do so today. He began a class for

Taken --for a Ride

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Elevators are a fact of life on the
Pitt campus. Face it, not matter
how helpful it is for your
cardiovascular system when you
trek up 10 ﬂights of stairs, few
people are going to make that

laborious effort.

Elevators come in a variety of
different categories, Despite
accounts of being stuck in one for
three hours or getting your pinkie
(and other noteworthy extremities)
slammed in a quick shutting door or
trying for 15 minutes to get the door,
to-shut, generally one can concede
that the hazards factor is about

«equal for all Pitt elevators.

However, certain elevators have
some unique characteristics:
Smoothest ride: The elevators at
Benedum Hall take top honors here.
It's a swift, non-jolting trip to the
top (kudos for the Engineersl).
Honorable mention goes to the
Cathedral, but because of the
altitude, your ears may pop.
Longest wait: Student Union
elevators tend to travel at a snail”s
pace. Although any elevator can
give you a long wait on any day,
those at Schenley Hall are
consistently the worst—especially
since it may take you seven trips up
and down before the doors ﬁnally
open on your desired ﬂoor. . "
Most disgusting graffiti: Tower B

A elevators tend to have the most

abusive messages. Racist or just
plain gross, they have something
for all of us. ,

Most damaged: Towers A and B
share this prize. «Huge dents in the
walls, doors that strain to shut, that
sort . of glamour that no other

elevators came close to duplicating. I

Rumor has it that most of the

said one woman who

damage is done by football players
who have imbibed too much after
the big game. According to one who
should know: “Well who else is

strong enough to bash those walls in .

like that?”

Most crowded: The Cathedral is
notorious for overcrowding. Want
to know how a sardine feels?—just

take a Cathedral elevator.
Benedum’s aren’t very good either,
but for some reason (maybe

because the walls aren’t carpeted)

they seem roomier. Maybe because ’

they seem so dark, the Cathedral
elevators are eerily reminiscent of a
coffin.

Cleanest elevator: Another tie
between the Cathedral and bene-
dum.

Dirtiest elevator: Any dormitory
elevator qualiﬁes, especially" the
Towers and Lothrop. One-Tower B
elevator reaked of spilled beer for at
least two? terms despite being
cleared at least once a week.

V Trickiest elevator: The Schenley
Hall elevators, for all that long wait,
have ‘a sneaky habit of slamming
shut when you least expect it. This
is especially surprising since the
doors tend to stay open indeﬁn-
ately.

Overall, the best elevators are in
Benedum, the worst in the Towers.
Honorable mention for quality
should'go to Hillman Library, but
since the maximum ride there is a
mere four ﬂoors, it really can’t stack
up against the regular competition.

Every elevator has its share_of

, strange stories—like being stuck

between floors with the door open,
like a crammed elevator that won’t
go up until someone gets off (and of
course, no one does), like dropping

things down the shaft, like having a
ﬁght erupt on the ﬁrst floor that
doesn’t stop until you reach ‘the
20th. C

There are also elevator perverts.
Not your typical ﬂashers or other
strange beings that you might have
an idea of how_ to handle, these
people are really weird. You can
always recognize an elevator freak
because they tend to live on the
elevators.
bring a chair on board so they are
comfortable during their many
trips. They are into bizarre
behavior like pinching, pickpocket-
ing, tripping, whispering obsceni-
ties and other little incidentals.
Doesn’t it sound weird? They do all
of the above at the Sametime, while
chugging a can of beer. The one
good point about elevator freaks is
that they never follow you off.

Ever ride an elevator with a
claustrophobic? For the benefit of
those who have never taken Psych
80 or read the comic strip
“Peanuts,” claustrophobia is the
fear of enclosed places. No
claustrophic in his right mind would
ride an elevator, right? Wrong.
First of all, claustrophobics are not
in their right minds. They tend to
stay away from the padded walls of
the Cathedral elevators, but
elsewhere on campus, you ‘never
know when one will turn up until the
elevator you happen to be riding
takes a kangaroo-‘type leap upward
or ,refuses to move. V g

The claustrophic clutches the
wall, begins to moan and if you

,happen to hear a clinking sound

behind or beside you, they are
either rattling rosary beads or their
teeth are chattering (usually the
latter).

Sometimes they even .

“I I

admitted she could stand to lose a
few more inches-—-quite a few, in,
fact. i

What kind of people take Tai-Chi
Chuan?

“We have many kinds of people
here,” said Chou. “We have
almost as many females as males,”
he added.

Many of the people who take -

Tai-Chi Chuan are interested in
self-defense techniques, but there
are also quite a number who, like
Chou, enjoy the exerciseand wish to
stay in shape. ’

So the next time some bully kicks
sand in your face or you walk past
your bedroom mirror and wince at
Y0“? Protruding waistline, experi-
ence a martial art. It just may help
the cause.

Its More Than A Feeling Boston is Hot

By M; PATRICK MQNAHAN A

Thingslare really coming up
roses for Boston and in the rock’ n’
roll business that spells “Big
Bucks."

Boston, a year-and-a-half old
quintet from Beantown U.S.A., has
a debut album which has sold nearly
four million copies since its release
last August.

On the merit of the phenomenal
response to the album (the most
ever sold by a new group the first
time out), it wasn’t surprising that
17,500 people jammed the Civic
Arena Wednesday night to listen to
Boston’s fresh, technically en-
hanced‘, infectiously melodic and
harmonic, heavy duty rock ’n’ roll.

What makes Boston such an odd’

band is that they literally have no
past. Made up of ﬁve musicians
who paid their dues in the North
Shore club section of Boston, most
of the cities on this-their debut
headlining tour-are cities they have
never played, even as an -opening
act.

For that reason alone,gBoston’s

’ ability as a performing band was a

mystery when they, took the stage.

of the record and asking: “‘ Will they

Leo

1' By PETE DICKS

Leo Kottke, the extraordinary
acoustic guitarist, appeared in
concert at California State College,
last Thursday charming a crowd of
725 with some of the most
beautiful, original and varied music
that one person could possibly
produce.

Kottke played a wide range of
compositions, both instrumental
and vocal, spanning his local
performing career from such
albums as “Dreams, and All That
Stuff,” “Greenhouse," “Mud-
lark,” and “Ice..water.”

Pausing between songs only
occasionally to tell funny anecdotes
about the subjects in his music, the
31-year-old Kottke clad in his street
clothes—white polo shirt, blue
jeans and tennis shoes without
socks—put great enthusiasm into
smiling
contentedly at his guitar as he
played perched on a stool.

Not just another pretentious solo
performer who steps on stage to
simply “entertain" and sing a few
songs and leave with pockets

stuffed with money, Kottke trans- ‘

cends all normal expectations.
Noted particularly for his 12-
string guitar playing, he is‘ one of
the best fingerpicking and bottle-
neck-style guitarists in the world,
with a unique musical approach

' - owing greatly to his having ignored

conventions of guitar playing (and
everything else) ever since he first
tried the instrument 20 years ago.

Kottle also is not just another
guitar wizard who earns his living
showing people how fast or fancy
he can play. He can play fast and
hard when a piece of music calls for
it, or he can pla_y sensitive, sweet
classical guitar.

The guitar is usually thought of
as an accompanying instrument to
singing or as a lead or rhythm
instrument, as in a rock band.
Rarely is it considered as a solo

instrument like the piano is, except "

in the case of classical guitar.

.vcrsion emphasizes

be good live and how will it compare
with the record?”

Introduced as “the hottest band
in America” (in this case it was
true), they opened with “Rock ’n’
Roll Band,”V and proceeded to blow‘
the roof off the arena with their
powerful and ﬂawless hour-and-a-
half set.

Drummer Sib Hashian and
bassist Frat: Sheehan, laid down a
rhythym section bristling with hard
and crisp rock patterns, while
rhythym guitarist Barry Goodreau
added plenty of ooomphy power
chords to Boston’s guitar domin-
ated songs. '

And good songs they were. Well
constructed, energetic and lyrically
interesting, Boston played six of the
eight songs from their monster
album, and several numbers from
their upcoming album, set for a late
summer release.

Boston’s songs have a wide-
based appeal, reﬂected by the
diverse ages of those in attendance. ,
The music is polished enough for
people in their late-20's, yet gutsy
enough for the rowdiest teens who
might like to work up a sweat.

stage leader of Boston is Tom Sholz,

Kottke. however, is able to
elevate the steel-string guitar to
the same stature as classical
because he plays instrumentals
that are so complete and full that
the addition of any other instru-
ment would only clutter the piece,
although he sometimes has used

bass, drums and piano on his
several records, with tasteful
effect.

Intrumental compositions such
as last Thursday's opener “Mona
Ray” and “Machine #2" will
inevitably become standards in
years to come if anyone can learn to
play. them properly.

Though Kottke does not possess
a beautiful, traditional «voice, he
does have an authoritative, unusual
baritone, faintly reminiscent of
Burl Ives, one of his childhood
influences. His voice meshes
perfectly with his playing so that
there are no weak spots in his
performance.

This meshing was exemplified in
Kottke’s rendition of the Byrds’
classic hit, “Eight Miles High," a
seemingly unlikely song for a solo
performance. While the original
high vocal
range harmonies and a psyche-
delic, loud sound, Kottke's version
is the antithesis of the Byrds..

Although the utilizes feverish
fingerpicking, his hard-edged,
desperate-sounding vocal carries
the song to a new level because the
music complements the excellent
lyrics instead of masking thefn
under: the instrumentals.

When one hears Kottke sing, the
desolation and the message in ‘the
lyrics of “Eight Miles High"
become absolutely clear. Although
he did not perform it in concert at
California. Kottke's excellent ver-
sion of Procul Harem's “Power
Failure" further demonstrates his
tremendous ability to completely
re-interpret multi-instrument
works successfully.

a 6-6 guitarist with a master's
degree in mechanical engineering
from MIT, who’s cut from the Jeff
Beck/Yardbird mold.

Like Beck, Sholz is prone to lay
back with his playing, picking his
spots for delivering killer barrages

of well-planned guitar ﬂash and

smokin’ runs.

On “More than a Feeling,”
“Foreplay/ Longtime” and “Smok-

By PETE DICKS

Leo Kottke is in the forefront of

acoustic guitarists, having easily
won “Guitar Player” magazine’s
poll as best guitarist in the folk‘
category for three years. As a

youth, Kottke played violin for three

years and trombone for eight before

deciding on the guitar, he says,

“because I could play more than

one note at a time.”

At age 31, Kottke has been
playing the guitar for 20 years and
performing for 12 years. Several
albums of his are available on
Capitol, Chrysalis and Takoma
records. He is best known for his
ﬁngerpicking and bottleneck play-
ing on the 12-string guitar. While
Kottke possesses a very unconven-
tional mind and an odd sense of
humor (in concert he said at one

point, “I’d like to play something ,

with a little different kind of defeat,
despair, death and decay...which
appeals to my sense of romance”),
he is an amiable, courteous man,
devoid of A the holier-than-thou
immaturity so common in popular
musicians today. He was generous
enough to allow an interview before
and after his performance last
Thursday at California. State
College. ,.

Pitt News: It’s puzzling how few“
articles and interviews there are
about you; it’s difficult to even ﬁnd
signiﬁcant details of your life and
career.

Leo Kottke: ‘Really? Think
anybody cares? Signiﬁcant details,
well that cuts it down a whole lot.

P.N. Well, let’s start here. You

are originally from Georgia, aren't
you?

L.K.: “Yes, Iwas born there, but
we only lived there for a year and a
half. Then we moved about every
two years. We went from there to
California to Washington State. It
just went on and on. The places I
remember the most are Oklahoma
and Wyoming because I started

playing thé guitar in Oklahoma and,

  
   

I lost my mind in Cheyenne
(Wyoming). It seems to me up until
then I was doin’ all right.”

P.N.: What sort of music did you
listen to when you were ﬁrst
learning guitar? .

L.K.: “I didn’t listen to many
people, which is how I started
writing, ’cause I made up what I
played. I’m a product of John
Phillip Sousa as much as anything
else, because of the years playing
trombone.”

P.N.: Did you practice a great
deal in the beginning?

L.K.: “I never have practiced. I
don’t recommend it; I think it’s a
backwards way to play. I don’t
practice now, but I play all.the time
and I ﬁnd that as long as you‘play,
things keep developing, and when
you stop playing, you lose it
altogether. ’ ’

P.N.: Then how does a person
learn guitar?

L.K.: ' “You just sit down and
play, don’t askanybody how to do it.

that’ll light ya up, but if you just
stay out of the way, it’ll all happen

did the crowd—standing for the

There’s no denying that Boston
has already attained the level of
success most performers work years
for.

Even with such phenomenal
success, however, Boston’s mem-
bers are not kids who will burn
themselves out on the evil fruits that
stardom often offers as a tempta-
tion; they are past that stage of
immaturity.

P.N.: Are there “best” times for
you to write music?

L.K.: ‘‘It can happen ‘any old

Robert G. Settelmaier:

Man Without A Team  

By JIM LEWIS

It seems that everybody is against Robert G. Settelmaier these days.
Mr. Settelmaier is a season ticket holder at Pitt Panther football
games who has missed only 12 contests in 36 years and can account for
the purchase of over 800 season tickets for himself, family and friends.
But, despite this loyalty, he may be ejected from his choice of seat——one
which he's had for some time-—because he hasn’t donated enough
money to the Pitt athletic program. .
Athletic director Ca's Myslinski has perfected a season ticket plan in
which those who donated $500 and $1000 will be able to sit in
‘ prime-choice sections 18 and 19. Those who haven't must move. Mr.

Pitt athletics for 36 years will be

by someone who has donated $500
or $1000 dollars this season (a total
much less than the amount of
money this man in question has
spent for the same athletic program
in his lifetime). A
In other words, pay up now in one
lump sum or get lost, buddy. K
Mr. Settelmaier has been active
in showing his displeasure in
Myslinski’s decision by writing a perplexed letter to the athletic director
and threatening to revoke his future season ticket purchases. It seemed
a personal battle between one man and the establishment was being
waged. .
Then, however, a Pittsburgh Press sports writer stepped into the
controversy and tried to justify Myslinski’s intentions. Unfortunately,
~ all the articles did was to confirm one belief—that those intentions aren’t
justifiable; it's pure and simple ‘greed.

explained that “the logic is
 simple——give the best seats to those

The Press writer continues by
anaking Myslinski’s actions seem

schools using the priority system...”. the article says, “...the Pitt plan
seems fairer.” He then goes on to mention that Penn State, North
Carolina State and others have done the same thing, only with much
more force and less care than Pitt is exercising. T

But the fact is, it isn't fair to Mr. Settelmaier. Here is a man that has

Goodyear Rolls to A
Second Place at Penn J

By DAVE McDONALD

PHILADELPHIA-For the
members of Pitt’s two- and four-
mile relays and the other 6,000
contestants that competed in the
83rd running of the Penn Relays,
all is history and some added
good experience, but for Panther
high jumper Dan Goodyear the

"relays meant a hurdle over a

personal goal. ‘

Goodyear, who placed second in
the college high jump, garnered
three other feats: (1) broke Tim
Riley’s 1974 Pitt school record of
6-10‘/2. (2) qualified for the
Association championships, and (3)
broke his own personal outdoor
best of 6-10 and his best indoor
jump of 6-11 with an outstanding
jump of 7-0. '

As one might guess, Goodyear
was quite ecstatic over clearing
seven-feet, for he honestly didn’t

think he could make it when they
raised the bar to" the seven-foot
notch.
“I was already pretty satisﬁed
jumped my personal best.of 6-11,
Goodyear said jubilantly, “so when
the bar went to seven-feet I
thought, ‘there is always the Pitt
invitational or the conference meet
to [make seven.’ Ijust didn’t thinkql
gcould--make it.” ' .
‘Other people who also had
doubts about Goodyear were a
pleased Pitt coach Mike Agos-

tinella and an equally excited

jumping partner, Keith‘ Taylor. \

“You can never know in the field
events,” Agostinella. said after the
meet. “One week you may be off

Tanner’sPirates Open--Steal the Show

By JOHN FEYDO 

Since dropping their ﬁrst three
games of the new baseball season,
the Pirates, under the. tutelage of
new skipper Chuck Tanner, have
turned things around by capturing
1/1 of their last‘15 contests since that
forgettable opening series with the

V S't.~ Iouis Cardinals.

The Bucs have won seven of their
last eight games in what has been a
very unpredictable season thus far.
After dropping the opening three-
game set to the Cards, Tanner’s
crew reeled off four straight wins
before again dropping three in a
row. Turning it around, the Bucs
won five in a row, absorbed an 11-3
pasting at the hands of the Houston
Astros last Friday night, but then
captured the final two games of the
Astro series Saturday and Sunday
( 10-0 and 4-3, respectively) to rest in
second place in the National League
East with an 11-7 mark.

Tanner’s “go-go Buccos” have"

swiped an amazing total of 35 bases
in the ﬁrst 18 games to lead the NL
by far (the-Dodgers are second with
18 steals) and have been caught
stealing only 18 times for a 66
percent success rate. V,

“We’ll be running all, year,”

promised Tanner. ‘ ‘I’ve always had
a running ball club. It puts added
pressure on the defense. It takes
soething away from their concentra-
tion if they (the opposition) know, or
think, we are running. And, of
course, we have the personnel to do
it. Look at these guys--Frankie
Tavares, Omar Moreno, Miguel
Dilone, Rennie Stennett, Dave
Parker-—-these guys can all ﬂy.
We’ll be running with some of the
other fellows, too, just to shake up
the defense. We won’t be afraid to
do something out of the ordinary.”
~ By contrast, at this point last year
the Bucs had stolen three bases and
had been caught four times. But
thus far Tavares alone is eight for 10
in stolen base attempts, Moreno is
eight for nine, Dilone is six for six,
and Stennett is four for six.

Even such “old-timers” as Bill
Robinson and Willie Stargell have
been digging for second under
Tanner’s all-out assault on the NL
East pennant. Robinson has
already swiped two bags, matching
his 1976 output and while Stargell
has yet to get a stolen base, he has
been heading for second as the
small but delighted crowds chant
“Go Willie Go.”

The Bucs have already stolen as

many as ﬁve sacks in a single game,
while their opponents have stolen
only seven in the ﬁrst 18 games,
while being gunned down eight
times.

But pennants aren’t won solely on
the— base paths. Although this

Pirate team.won’t be as powerful as’
those of the recent past, Tanner is
counting on a combination of big

 

bats and speed to keep the onense
rolling. The Bucs are currently
hitting .265 as a team, ﬁfth in the
NL, and have clubbed 15 homers.

It has been said that pitching is 75
percent of the game and although
the Buc hurlers are not as publicized
as the hitters, they may be the best
10-man staff in the National
League.

“We don’t get enough ink,”
Bucco lefty starter Jimmy Rooker
maintained. “All you hear about is
‘lumber and lightning,’ well how
about ‘lumber, lightning and
smoke?’ That’s us, the pitchers,
‘smoke.’ Hey, we can bring it.”

Tanner has been going with an
‘early four-man rotation of lefties-
John Candelaria (2.0 1.35 ERA),
Rooker (3-1_ 4.26), Jerry Reuss (0-3,
4.26) and right-hander Bruce Kison
(2-1 3.22). Soon to be added to the
rotation is right-handed Larry
Demery, who will start in Atlanta
tomorrow night.

Tanner hasn’t been afraid to use a
“quick hook” with his starters, as
witnessed by the Bucs having only
two complete games in the first 18

' contests. ~

   

Everybody is stealing the show these days-I-even Pirate left fielder Al Oliver.

Although his base-stealing isn’t exactly in the top 10 in the league, the out-
fielder earned Qame-tying and game winning RBIs in Sunday’s series finale

withethe Houston Astros. 1 _ ..

Rich Gossage has been the
stopper so far sporting a 3-0 record
and a 1.06 ERA plus two saves in 10
appearances. He has pitched
superbly in nine of those 10 games.

Assisting Gossage is last year’s
ace, Kent Tekulve (1-0, 2.70 ERA,

‘. one save), who has done the job on
ﬁve of the seven occasions Tanner

has called on him. ».

Ramon Hernandez as the Bucs’
left-handed stopper this season and
sports a 1.23 ERA in six
appearances. , Odell Jones and
Terry Forester have been hit hard in
the early going but pitching Coach
Larry Sherry attributes this to lack
of work. ,

“These guys will be okay, they
just need some work,” -he said.
“They both went 10 days between
appearances and there’ s just no way
they could have been sharp.”

On the “Lumber” side of things‘,
right ﬁelder Dave arker and
‘ ‘super-sub’ ’ (or “super-regular’ ’
as Tanner prefers to call him) Bill
Robinson, have inflicted the most
damage on opposing moundsmen.
Parker is pounding the ball at a .400
clip (third in the league) with three
homers and 16 RBIs.

“I’m just seeing the ball real
well,” he explained. “I’m just
swinging away.” Robinson,
currently hampered by his second
pulled hamstring muscle of the
season, is sitting out a few days but
in 14 contests is riding along at .333
with one homer and 13 RBIs.

“I plan on having an even better
season’ than last year,” he said.
‘ ‘Chuck ‘says I’ll play and as long as
I play, I’ll hit.”

Also beginning to pound the ball
is left ﬁelder Al Oliver, just
recovering from a mouth ulcer. His
home run in the ninth inning sent
Sunday’s game into extra innings.
He later won it in the.tenth with a
ground ball single to right which
scored Moreno, who had beat out an
inﬁeld hit and stole second.

“I’m about 90 percent right
now,” said Oliver. “The whole
thing with me is being healthy, but
I’m feeling better every day.”

Fresh off the disabled list, Willie
Stargell has stepped back into the
lineup at ﬁrst base and clubbed

three homers in the weekend Astros
series, including two on Sunday, as
he kept the Bucs in the game with
two smashes over the centerﬁeld
wall off Houston right-hander Mark
Lemongello.

Newly acquired third baseman
Phil Garner has been asked to make
a double adjustment since coming
from ‘Oakland in the big spring
Garner played
second base at Oakland and also
played on grass in the American
League, with the exception of
Kansas City.

“The carpet here is real fast and
the seams are tricky,” he said.
‘ ‘It’s also hard to get used to playing
on the other side of the inﬁeld, but
it’s coming along.”

At the beginning of the year, it
looked like Duffy Dyer had the
catching spot nailed down, but Ed
Ott has emerged to split time
equally with Dyer.

‘ “We have two number-one,

catchers right q now,” Tanner
explained. ‘ ‘Eddie’s made tremen-
dous improvements as a catcher in
the two years he’s been catching
and Duffy is recognized throughout
the league as a ﬁne handler of
pitchers.”

On the negative side, the Bucco
defense, never a strong unit, has
been rather shaky in the early
going, committing 18 errors in the
ﬁrst 18 games. The outﬁelder still
miss the cutoff men too often and

the infield needs to develop more
consistency, especially on routine
pop-ups, several of which have been

While members of the men's
track team spent last weekend at
the Penn Relays, the Pantherettes
were busy competing in the
University of Maryland Invita-
tional. The climax of this meet
came late in the sunny afternoon
when Penn State’s two-mile relay
set a new national record,
shattering Kansas State’s existing
time of 9:17 by more than eight
seconds. ,

For Pitt, ,,freshman Carmen
Scherich was the most successful
Pantherette, winning the javelin
competition.) She was also sixth in
theshot put. A

Proving Saturday to be less of
“track" and more of a "ﬁeld" day
were high jumpers Karen Kritchko

.-

_ Scherichlioints Women:

and Marie Ribik. Both cleared the
same height, although Kritchko
was awarded third- and Ribik
ﬁfth-place on misses.

Added to the ever-lengthening
injured list were hurdlers Sue
Lewis and Michelle Bressant.
Whether or not this pair will be
able to compete today against
Indiana (of Pa.) at Pitt Stadium is
yet unknown.

The Indiana affair will not be
scored and will serve as a practice
for this weekend’s Eastern Asso-
ciation for Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (EAIAW) champion-
ships at ‘East Stroudsburg State
College.

McCarthy Bright Spot 
In Go|fers’Dul| Finish

By JOHN FINN

It was the same old story for the
Pitt golf team this weekend at
University Park—three regulars out
of action, one outstanding perfor-
mance and an overall disappointing
show at the Penn State_ Invitational.

Pitt’s only bright spot was Kevin
McCarthy. McCarthy, who ﬁnished
with a 228 (just ﬁve shots off the
pace), was the co-leader for the

tournament after 18 of the 54-hole

tournament. -

“Kevin played extremely well,”
coach Steve Petropsaid, “and I was
very happy to see him do so well.”

Meanwhile, McCarthy’s team-
mates didn't fare as well. Jim
McGrath shot a 246, Jim Fitzsim-
mons turned in a 248, Bob Elliot
carded a 250 and Bob Mauro, who
played so well in Pitt’s last match,
had a 252. A

At the same time, Pitt had three

um  

Records and Tapes.

   

regulars who were once again
unable. to participate.
captain Bill Burkardt was just

released from the hospital after‘.

suffering from a virus. Bob Kurey
had returned home for the summer
and Bruce Stephen is still ineligible.

In a tournament dominated by
Penn State’s blue team, Petro noted
that he was not all that disappointed
with his team’s performance.

“This was a real tough tourna-
ment,” he said, “and with three
regulars missing it was even more
difﬁcult.” *

Before closing out the season at
the competitive Indiana University
of Pennsylvania Invitational Friday,
Pitt will play two quadrangular
matches. The Panthers, travel to
Meadville for a match at Allegheny
College tommorrow and then go to
Youngstown on Thursday.

MEET THE MAGICIANS.

. No introductions needed here: youknow who they are. Return to
Forever. Brilliant musicians with their collective consciousness firmly fixed on
greatness. The leaders of this exceptional crew just triumphed in down beat '5'
Readers’ Poll Awards as Best.\Pianist and Best Bassist. (That’s the same bassist
whom Rolling Stone recently honored as J azzman of the Year.)

Hear Return to Forever at work——on a brand—new album. It’s called
“Musicmag'.icI’ and it’s magic, all right. It could be Return to Forever’s biggest
album ever-—and you don’t have to be clairvoyant to know that. [

"Ventura was a member of the

victorious two-mile and medley

second-place teams, running parti-
cularly well in the mile relay.
Suhayda earned her award by
winning both the shot put and

the jump,” Taylor admitted hap-A"

pily. \

For Goodyear, a junior, it was a
long, hard jump competition on
Saturday at Franklin Field—he had
to take over 20 jumps in a
three-hour span. A

“I had a shot at ﬁrst place in the
jump-off with another jumper from
Michigan (they had both cleared
7-0), but by that time I was
exausted,” he explained.

In the four-mile relay, Pitt’s
team of Mel Boyd (4:06), Gary
Siriano (4:16), Nort McDonald

(4:07) and Tom Herrmann (4:06) .

placed 8th in a field of 20 teams led
by the winning Tennessee squad.

The two-mile relay saw the
Panther team of Herrmann, Boyd,
Dan Dattilo and Rich Moore place

sixth in the college division with a- n

time of 7:36. Moore and Herrmann
both ran 1:53 half-miles for the

relay, while Boyd and Dattilo
tabulated a 1:54 -and 1:56,
respectively. .

PITT TRACKS—In the hurried- ’
*ness of the ofﬁcials at the relays

Pitt’s Mel Boyd was lined up in the
wrong race. Boyd was all settto run

“the olympic developmental mile 1

relay and actually ran 10 yards in
the race before he and teammates
realized their race was actuallythe
next race. ‘
