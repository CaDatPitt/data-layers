Marchcrs Maintain  

Rabbi Inaccurate

The University supporters of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) asserted in a formal state-
ment that the recent comments made by Rabbi Richard
Rubenstein, a University chaplain, concerning the march to
Montgomery have been “inaccurate and harmful to the

nation’s civil rights movement.” The statement which was 

issued Monday was signed
by 48 of the 130 students
who participated in last
week’s march.

Concerning Dr. Ruben-
stein’s accusation that “they
(SNCC) wanted dead bod-
ies, our bodies,” the SNCC sup-
porters stated that they believed
that no person can judge an-
other’s undeclared motives. The
group called Dr. Rubenstein’s
statement “without any stated
substantiation” that a leader of
the civil rights movement “want-
ed dead bodies” “irresponsible.”

The signers quoted Dr. Ruben-
stein as saying that “we were
assured by SNCC in Montgomery
that police permission had been
granted for the demonstration
there.” According to the state-
ment, the SNCC supporters, how-
ever, reported that SNCC leaders
informed Pittsburgh spokesmen,
John Rusk.ay, Eric Stern, and
Linda Watts, Tuesday at a 9 a.m.
meeting in Montgomery that there
was no permit to march.

The statement continued, “The
Pittsburgh spokesmen took part
in and approved of the planning
of the Tuesday march which re-
sulted in violence. While Dr. Ru-
benstein’s misinformation may
have resulted from a breakdown
in communication between the
Pittsburgh spokesmen and the
rest of the group, SNCC cannot
be held responsible.”

According to SNCC, Dr. Ru-
benstein further stated, that “sev-
eral years ago, it (SNCC) did
not take people who had no train-
ing whatsoever, as it tried to do
with the Pittsburgh students this
Week. “Every student was given
a brieﬁng in the methods of non-
violence. Furthermore, they were
told by SNCC and Pittsburgh
leaders on Tuesday morning that

they might lose their lives on g 

the streets of Montgomery.”

The students, said SNCC, were ‘
offered the opportunity to work.

in clerical capacities or to re-
frain from participation in the
march if they so desired. Every
student signed a card noting pro-
cedures that would be followed
“in case of emergency.”

“It should be noted that when S It
the hundreds of Northerners join-~

ed the march in Selma on March
9,” the statement read, “the scene

of brutality just two days before, .

the Northerners were given brief
orientations similar to those re-
ceived by Pittsburgh students.

Thus it is hardly justiﬁed to ac-_ _ '

cuse SNCC, as Dr. Rubenstein has,
of attempting to make bloody
martyrs of unprepared students.‘

“Many of the other criticisms
of SNCC by Dr. Rubenstein re-
ﬂeet a lack of total understand-
ing of and familiarity with the
civil rights movement of our na-
tion.

“Dr. Rubenstein’s assumption
that only SNCC conducts demon-

strations without permits and/or 
against court injunctions is false. I
Numerous sit-ins, freedom rides, .

and the Tuesday, March 9, march
from Selma, led by Dr. Martin

’ Luther King, have violated court 
orders and/or have been conduct-  T],

ed without permits. _
“Dr. Rubenstein asserted that
the involvement of high school

students in the demonstration 

was both ‘immoral and illegal.‘
While the encouragement of stu-
dents to leave school might have
been illegal, We should realize
that throughout the country, high
school students have been exten-
sively used in similar demonstra-
tions by all responsible civil
rights organizations.

“Dr. Rubenstein implied that

SNCC was responsible for pro-
V0kiI1g the police brutality of
Tuesday. We believe that police
brutality throughout the South is
not the product of demonstra-
tions but rather is the result of

a vicious system whose violence ’

would run rampant is not ex-
posed. -

“In addition. even the officials
°1’ Montgomery, Alabama (hard-
ly pro-SNCC), have attributed the
violence to ‘mistakes’ "on the part
01' the city and county police,
Accordingly, we consider Dr. Ru-
benstein’s assertion that SNCC
provoked the violence of Tues.
day unwarranted.

“In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 

it Was reported that ‘Dr. Ruben-

stein said that the Pittsburgh 
students went to Montgomery I 1-

thinking it was another non-vio-

lent demonstration,’ and heard I

from a SNCC leader the ﬁrst day
‘You may have to lay your life
down in this demonstration.’
This clearly indicates Dr. Ruben.

The Electrical Engineers were chosen
overall winners for this year’s Engineers’
Week. Second place winners were the In-

Marilyn Wascou, a freshman and the Chemical

In the other events, the Civil Engineers were

Engineers of the “Litchﬁeld Monopoly Game,”
Electrical Engineers of the “catch-a-coed” contest,
and the Industrial Engineers of the Display. There
was no winner for the arrival because inclement
weather prevented the judges from attending.

This year, Saint Patrick, patron saint of the
engineers, arrived at the parade in an ambulance _ .
and was carried to the crowd‘ on a stretcher. Prior
to this, the different groups of engineers paraded
down the hill to the front of the Student Union
to watch the arrival. Hal Murray of radio station

Noted Philosophers Gather for Symposium;
Scientific Study of Human Behavior Discussed

By PETE HORN
and NANCY DELANEY
A two-day philosophy
symposium held here this
weekend to discuss problems
in the scientific study of hu-
man behavior hosted three

outstanding philosophers:
Stuart Hampshire, chair-
man of the philosophy de-
partment at Princeton Uni-
versity; Professor May Brodbeck
from the University of Minnesota,
and Dr. James Edie from North-
western University.

Professor Hampshire, author of
Thought and Action, delineated
two uses of “can” in his Friday
afternoon lecture: that use of
“can” which refers to human ac-
tions and that which refers to
natural happenings.

He pointed out that a sentence
of the type, “the gas can escape,"
will be veriﬁed if, in fact, the
gas does escape under the prop-
er conditions. In reference to
human action, however, no test
of this sort is sufficient. For ex-
ample, the tact that a prisoner
does not escape does not indi-
cate that he cannot. Perhaps he
does not want to.

. RACK 8: CUE

It is relevant in the case of
human actions to consider de-
sire, Professor Hampshire ex-
plained, whereas it is not rele-
vant in the case of inanimate ob-
jects. Human failure establishes
lack of power only when desire
to succeed has also been estab-
lished.

Dr. Edie, author of numerous
articles on phenomenologr, cau-
ed for the adoption of a subjec-
tive (phenomenological) method
in the behavioral sciences, espe-
cially psychiatry, arguing that
meanings and intentions must be
taken into account for a com-
plete picture of the human exper-
ience. He spoke Saturday morn-
ing.

Saturday afternoon, Miss Brod-
beck discussed the reduction of
mental states to physical states,
particularly with respect to per-
ception. She said that perceived
objects are identical with physi-
cal objects only in a weak sense,

and that perceptual qualities are
not in the mind.

She examined three statements
which had arisen from Galilean
physics. The statements are 1)
Perceptual qualities do not exist;
2) Perceptual objects are identi-
cal with clusters of invisible par-
ticles; and 3) Perceptual qualities
really are in the mind.

According to Miss Brodbeck,
who delievered a philosophy of
science lecture at the University
last Thursday, the ﬁrst state-
ment correctly implies that talk
of perceptual qualities has no
place in physical theory. The sec-
ond is correct only if identity is
construed in the sense of “model
identity,” not as primary or log-
ical identity.

Physical objects cannot be log-
ically identical with perceptual
objects because they don’t exem-
plify all the same qualities, e.g.,
a cluster of molecules cannot be
the same as a dish of water since
a cluster of molecules does not

exhibit wetness.

Instead, perceptual objects are
identical with physical objects in
the sense that they are corre
lated through a model. Physical
theory is a model for perceptual
theory, just as logic is a, model
for arithmetic. The identity is not
between words or objects, but be-
tween facts. Whole sentences in
perceptual language can be re-
placed by corresponding sen-
tences in the physical language.

In regard to statement three,
a perceptual quality is “in the
mind” only if it is referred to
by a word in a sentence describ-
ing a conscious or mental state.
But perceptual words never ap-
pear in such sentences, accord-
ing to Miss Brodbeck, and hence
perceptions are not in the mind.

   Academic Integrity
Statement Issued

By Faculty Senate

The “initial responsibility” for
curbing cheating “rests on the
classroom instructor.” This ver-
dict was issued by the Educa-
tional Policies Committee of
the University Senate which
drafted a faculty statement on
academic integrity for discus-
sion by the faculties and ﬁnal
approval by Chancellor Ed-
ward H. Litchﬁeld.

The statement was in re-
sponse to a cheating flareup
which began here last trimes-
ter and was rekindled and then
brought to a head by the re-
cent cheating expose at the Air‘
Force Academy in Colorado.

The faculty statement fol-
lows in its entirety.

The University of Pitts-
burgh seeks excellence in
the discovery and dissemin-‘
ation of knowledge. Excel-
lence in scholarship cannot
be achieved in situations
which are contaminated by
dishonest practices. All members
of the University community are
obligated to adhere to the high-
est standards of integrity in
study, research, instruction, and
evaluation.

It is presumed that those who
instruct and administer observe
such standards of integrity. Ad-
ministrators and senior faculty
members are presumed to accept
the concept of academic integrity
and to seek to live by it but they
may need continuing clariﬁcation
of the concept and guidance in
its observance. Particularly, stu-
dents need the assurance that
those who work "honestly will not
suffer thereby in comparisons
with the dishonest. Those who
cannot or will not adopt the con-
cept and practices of academic
honesty do not belong within the
University.

Implementation of This Policy

Situations in which, integrity
may be an issue on college cam-
puses include:

1. The subordination of scholarly

standards to ideology, preju-
dice, or self-interest.

2. The pretense of an unsubstan-
tiated degree of knowledge or
expertness.

3- The appropriation of know-
ledge or creativity without due
acknowledgement of its origin,
as, in papers copied from
source materials without doc-
umentation.

4. The utilization of sources of
knowledge not authorized or
approved for the task at hand,
as, “cribs” in examinations
where memory is required or
the copying of whole or partial
materials from others where
individual production is re-
quired.

5. Attempts to obtain special con-
sideration through the use of
non-intellectual factors,as, . per-
sonal charm, appeals to sym-
pathy, distinction in extra-cur-
ricular activities, etc.

6. Contribution to the dishonesty
of another by allowing one’s
work to be copied. Substitut-
ing for another when he is be-
ing evaluated, using- or com-
municating unauthorized ad-
vance information, ghost writ-
1118. and the like are practices
which are as unethical for the
giver as for the receiver.
Certain instructional practices

facilitate or interfere with the

demonstration of a high degree_
of intellwtual honesty. Although
these may seem obvious, they

 
 
 

ance of instructors and to clarify
to students that the instructor
who observes them does so be-
cause he wishes to create oppor-
tunities most favorable for the
practice of integrity and to in-
sure his best evaluation of them
as individuals.

1.An instructor largely sets the
standards which apply in his
classroom. As he is concern-
ed, accurate, objective, fair.
and consistent, he may expect
similar behavior in his stu-
dents.

2. Challenging tasks in assign-
ments and examinations are
more favorable for honest
dealing than are those which
are repetitive or unimagina-
tive. Tasks which require much
in the way of time and but lit-
tle in the way of intellect en-
courage students to detach
performance from standards.

3. The degree of honesty dem-
onstrated in classes is in-
ﬂuenced by a subtle but real
climate respecting h o n e s t y .
Cheating tends to be minimiz-
ed where there is a commun-
ity commitment to integrity.
Known or presumed existence
of dishonesty increases the
temptation to be dishonest.

4. The assumption of an honor
system where ones does not
exist is unwarranted; the in-
structor who does so abdi-
cates his role as an evaluator.
In addition, he assumes the
position of forcing insecure
individuals to cheat for sur-
vival.

5. The assumption that dishon-
esty is related to credit earn-
ing is not always valid. Dis-
honesty can be- prompted by a
kind of rebellion against dic-
tatorial instruction, unfair
grading, or the imputation
that all students are inherent-
ly dishonest. Similarly, the
generation of undue anxiety
over grades can disrupt the
usual standards which a stu-
dent may observe.

6. Honesty is fostered by favor-
able personal relationships.
Temptation to cheat increases
as students feel that they are
identiﬁed only by their chair
numbers, that their papers
are T0311 by “ghos ,” or that
they are evaluated merely as
specimens pinned to a point
on a curve.

7. Instructors are not policemen
but they are evaluators and
they can evaluate best only
if they can assume that each
individual’s work is his own
and was done under prescrib-
ed conditions. For this reason,
instructors have the privilege
and responsibility of openly
observing their students in
examinations and laboratory
and of refusing to evaluate
any student evidencing un-
ethical practices.

8. Opportunity for dishonesty on
examinations is decreased by
such administrative proce-
dures as alternate seating, al-

If it had not been for Joan Baez’s melod-

ic strains that broke the monotony of Dy-
[an’s droning, this reviewer would have left after

the ﬁrst song. Dylan was barely tolerable when
he sang, but he had to prove that he had other

talents besides singing.

So, resembling Howdy D00dY’S One man bfmdv
he played harmonica and guitar at the same time.
We .asked Dylan why he chose to become a folk
singer. He ran his hand through his hair, a mop
that makes the Beatles seem conservative. “It’s
the only thing I’m good 317:” he 531d-

He says he started folk singing at the 3-30 0f 11
and has been singing for the past 13 y8a1'S- -“I
even tried grave digging for a while.” he expla-lnr

The times they are really changin’ when
akid with a voice like Bob Dylan’s can stand
up before 5,000 people and sing through his
nose about God and freedom, and get away

with it. And that is just what Dylan did at
Syria Mosque last Wednesday and Thursday

ed, “but I wasn’t even xood at that, so I decided
to keep singing.”

Both Boy Dylan and Joan Baez say they sing _
to make people think. They both say their sing-
ing and writing serves no other purpose. When
they sang at the Mosque, they sang to make the
people think who were paying anywhere between
$2.50 and $4.00 to see them.

When Miss Baez sings in the South, she sings

for the same reasons. “I never sing in white schools
anymore,” she said. “The kids there listen to
your songs, and they .agree outwardly with what
you say, but they don't practice what they say
they agree with.”

For that reason, Miss Baez now sings only in

the Negro schools. “They can understand what I’m
saying," she said. “I can communicate with them.”

Many of the songs that both these people sing
have been written by them. This is where Bob
Dylan’s true talent lies. He has the ability to put
into words what is felt by so many popular folk
singers. Dylan’s songs would come across better
if he would let Miss Baez, or a group like the
Kingston Trio or Peter, Paul, and Mary sing them.

ternate forms of tests, effi-
cient proctoring, assurance of
fairness in grading, strict con-
trol of duplication and stor-
age. Temptation for cheating
may also be decreased by the
use of multiple measures, clear
instructions, orderly but non-
threatening administration,
provision of practice items
prior to unfamiliar item
styles, library ﬁling Of Pre-
vious tests, etc.

9. Special problems exist in the
large class. An unassisted in-
structor cannot be expected to
cope adequately with large
populations. Deans should see
that competent proctors are
available to aid him. National
testing services insist on one
proctor for 25 examinees.

10. Under certain circumstances
the honesty of speciﬁc beha-
vior may be debatable.‘ For
example, the principle that
all borrowed knowledge must
be documented can be carried
to extremes of tedium or im-
possibility. Or, at times, col-
laboration may be either de-
sirable or prohibited. The
student must be guided by in-
structions and, if these are
not made clear, request clari-
ﬁcation.

Enforcement

As violations of academic hon-
esty occur, it would be convenient
if there were lists of crimes and
punishments. In reality, the vari-
ety of possible infr.actions and
the mitigating circumstances of
each event are too complex to
permit such simple treatment.

Enforcement of academic in-
tegrity is the responsibility of in-
structors, department chairmen,
and academic deans. Their re-
sponsibility includes both its en-
forcement in their own teaching
and the guiding and encouraging
of students and teaching assis-
tants in its observance. Their re-
sponsibilities cannot be diverted
to administrative personnel ex-
cept as certain administrators

may be empowered to transmit"

to students notice of action, as
suspension or expulsion.

Initial responsibility rests on
the classroom instructor. When he

observes a violation of honesty,

he should promptly withdraw the
offender from the competition in
which he is engaged and notify
him of the fact. (This is not to
say that the instructor’s action
must be instantaneous or embar-
rassing.) Using the frame of ref-
erence that the task at hand can-
not be counted positively in the
student’s evaluation can serve to
detach the instructor from moral
evaluations or public accusations.

When an instructor has con-
cluded that dishonesty has oc-
curred and that the oifender’s
grade will be lowered in conse-
quence, he should report the of-
fense. If the offense is minor, in-
volves only the task at hand, and
will not result in course failure
the instructor may choose to
make reporting contingent upon
the student’s subsequent conduct.
If the student is again observed
tq be dishonest, the instructor
must report the offenses and the
student must be failed in the
course.

The instructor’s reports of in-
fractions of honesty should be to
the academic dean of the school
in which the offending student is
a. candidate for a degree or, ad-
mitted, if not a degree candidate.
Since dishonest practices are us-
ually concealed, instructors fre-
quently must deal with suspicion
rather than complete proof. The
instructor’s report to the dean
should indicate the nature of the
evidence of dishonesty and the
dean should accept his report as
a valid statement of the circum-
stances.

It is to be noted that inherent
in this enforcement procedure is
the premise that the instructor
does not put himself on trial by
reporting dishonesty. Students, of
course, are in no way threatened
by this premise so long as they
do not compromise their honesty.
All reports of infractions and
discussions prior to -ﬁnal decision
should be highly conﬁdential;
e.g., not reported through cleri-

cal channels or discussed with
colleagues or students not in-
volved.

When the dean receives notice
of an infraction, he should inter-

disciplinary action he considers
appropriate including warning,
probation, suspension, or expul-
sion. The dean should report the
offense to the Dean of Students
as a record of the event and to
learn relevant additional infor-
mation about the student.

This statement of policy ‘ap-
plies to the total University and
its uniform observance is expect-
ed of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration. Separate schools, di-
visions, or campuses may, by fac-
ulty action, elaborate or revise
the enforcement procedures as
appropriate to their purposes.

  No Time for Bickering

. Monday evening was the occasion for an unusual panel
- discussion on WPGH. It amounted to the attempted re-
 futation of Rabbi Rubenstein’s allegations about the Stu-

dent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), by
‘L SNCC members and other students who had gone to Ala-
_ What some people wanted was a chance to call Rabbi
 Rubenstein a liar. This never happened. Instead everyone
talked in vague generalities. The conversation outside the
studio, however, was much more agitated. Someone outside
- asked, “now that they had Rabbi Rubenstein there and had
 stuck a knife in his ribs, “Why doesn't someone turn it?”

Why does someone have to turn a knife in anyone?
Rabbi Rubenstein made some serious accusations about that
V civil rights group. The group replied through a petition in
which they discussed the Rabbi’s arguments one by one.
According to one spokesman for the group, the petition was

 

. signed -by as many students as possible and then handed

over to Rabbi Rubenstein. It was hoped that he would issue
a retraction of his statements. If this did not occur, then

 the petition would be given to the press.

Of the 130 students who went to Alabama, it seems

5:" I there are 130 leaders. No one is sure who represents the

whole group.
, This is further complicated by the fact that everyone

 is talking, but in little secret groups, adding to the confu-
i_ _ sion caused by the vacuum of no leadership.

It isn't necessary to have such fervor in such a point-

 . less direction. Rabbi Rubenstein had stated flatly‘ that he
 ‘ will not mention SNCC in his classes, or anywhere in pub-
 I lie, including radio programs. He has apologized for the
 trouble that his statements has caused, but he still believes
‘V’ It in what he said. These people should realize that they are

not going to sway the Rabbi and their constant bickering

 with him is only hurting the movement.

_ It is about time that these people stop being so clan-
. destine and so petty and do something constructive for the

 3 civil rights movement. They could lend their whole sup-
U port to a informal group begun by Dean Helen Pool Rush

U to unofficially help coordinate social movements on this
’ campus. If this is not acceptable, then they should start a

 University chapter of SNGC and elect a president who would

- speakfor all of them.

  Apathetic Student Disappears

As Civil Rights Movement Grows

(Miss Epstein was one of the 130 students who
went to Montgomery, Ala. last week.)

What happened to the apathetic Uni-
versity student last week? Why did stu-
dents go to Alabama or read the newspap-
ers, and listen to the news bulletins?

University students are no longer com-
pletely apathetic. Recently they showed a
great interest in the Civil Rights’ ‘movement.
They want to see all Americans free and
equal, and practicing their constitutional
rights by voting, at-
tending any school,
speaking freely, and
receiving employment
by their qualiﬁcations,
not their skin color.
Students and other
Americans of both the
North and the South
hope that these rights
j become reality and
* * fought many years for
MISS EPSTEIN this equality.

The words to the folk song “Keep Your
Eyes On the Prize” include a refrain that
says “the only thing that we did right was
the -day we begun to fight.” These words
symbolize the orientation of _ the Civil
Rights movement in the United States and
at the University.

ON CAMPUS a Pitt Chapter of the
NAACP was reinstated in September of
1963. Very few students joined and showed
interest but there were meetings, rallies and
projects to test housing facilities within the
University area, fair employment practices,
and to help voter registration continue
throughout Pittsburgh. .

That same month the country heard the
explosion of a bomb. in a Birmingham
church where four7'girls were killed.‘ This
was after the August 28 March on Wash-
ington, and the national fight for equality
was intensifying. Some journalists wrongly
called this movement “the Negro Revolu-
tion of 1963" but it was only the beginning
of this revolution. This march towards
equality can't end in one year nor in a
decade.

On November 17, 1963 there was a Pitts-
burgh march on the Post Office led by
Mayor Joseph M. Barr and Jerome Smith of
CORE. Thousands of -demonstrators mailed
letters urging their Congressmen to pass

    

By Vicki Epstein

Civil Rights legislation. Our NAACP Chap-
ter participate-d but University attendance
was poor both at the march and at an earli-
er rally in Heinz Chapel.

THESE ARE SOME of the University
activities that began the Civil‘ Rights move-
ment on campus last year. There are also
long range goals for the University and for
Civil Rights. In the past most apathetic
University students preferred to condemn
those interested in the fight for equality.
There was no brotherhood or closeness on
campus. Now students meet with public
school pupils to tutor them, to get to know

them, and to share as equals. __We have -

overcome the initial barrier and the label
of apathetic is slowly disappearing.
The recent trip to Alabama by Univers-
ity students aroused interest and emotion.
This is not a partial nor a temporary inter-
est. It is the greatest unification of fellows
ever seen on this campus.
L The students who left for Alabama were
strangers. After several hours the feeling‘
of brotherhood grew while singing freedom
songs, talking about personal reasons -for
going, and sharing values. One boy even
said that he felt closer to these students
than he did to anyone he had met in his two
years at the University.

While this uniﬁcation occurred others
listened to WPGH, probably for the ﬁrst
time. Students worried about their col-
leagues and wondered how true the news

, reports were, and if anyone was injured.

Concern increased.

NOW THERE ARE many opportunities
for all students and many things Americans
canand must do. The important thing is to
act now.

The students who went to Alabama are
forming one, uniﬁed campus group to work
in Pittsburgh, Washington, throughout the
South and all over America to make the
dream of equality a reality.

This organization, although now in the
planning stages, hopes to write a Constitu-
tion.' stating its purpose and long range
goals, and elect officers soon. When it be-
comes a University brotherhood it will show
that the apathetic student no longer in-
habits this campus because the apathetic
student will join the march towards com-
plete American freedom. Join in the ral-
lies and organization of this group and help
the dream for equality become a reality.

 

   
   
 

 .The Other Side \s: 

Prejudice Distorts Perspective on the South

Admist the furor of the recent Montgom-
ery demonstrations, the civil rights issue has
been jolted into askewed perspective. Student

 accounts have been biased and emotion-laden,
 making the venture seem like a totally noble
 and humanitarian gesture. They fail to recog-

nize the other point of view.

Participants exhaust-
ed a -barrage of adjec-
tives, describing the in-
cidents as horrible, ter-
rible, bloody, frighten-
ing, and “the most ter-
rifying situation you
could imagine.” Often
there were as many dif-
ferent accounts of an in-
ci-dent as there were par-
ticipants.

BUT THESE views are all from self-pro-
claimed pro-civil rights adherents. Their own
emotion-filled statements prove many of their

:~ views are exaggereated and prejudiced.

Prejudice is a two-Way street, and it travels

‘:~"fNorth as well as South. The fact is that many
7 .-Northerners have a distorted and bigoted per-
 spective on civil rights.

' Originally, the non-violent movement was
initiated to gain Negroes the rights they had

 . been denied- The foc_us-for this effort ‘Was, Ila: . 
‘ one ‘the. South, (that ‘intolerable closed-_, ‘

t  H

  

 

minded area of bigotry and hate. Southerners
were disgustingly prejudice against Negroes,
and never gave them equal rights.

. MANY PARTICIPANTS in the movement
claimed they realized the grave social implica-
tions and the reasons why Southerners are
anti-Negro. They claimed to understand the
history involved, and the stable social institu-
tions which propogate the ethnic of racial segre-
gation. But it has been long enough, so they
claim, and now the South must be jolted from
ignorance and stagnation. They are the good
guys and the Southerners are_the bad guys.

But this is not a game, and the good guys
aren’t so good. As the tide of emotion grows,

these original insights become lost. Many no .

longer realize they are trying to uproot a way
of life which is the product of a century of
rigorous socialization.

Many of these enthusiasts further claim
that those who do not sympathize with their
convictions are pathetic and unaware of the

, changing times. They are trailblazers in the
maze of Southern bigotry and prejudice. If you.

don’t act, many claim, you do not believe in
civil rights.

YET THESE noble people, sacrificing _pre-
cious time from their education and vocations,

ate and distort events to conform to their own
view.

Dr. Richard Lazarus, a noted psychologist
from Berkley, pointed out this phenomena in
stating that there is a “general process of re-
sistance to the assimilation of material alien to
one’s point of view, especially if it is strongly
held.” Persons tend to listen to views similar
to their own, they congregate with people of
similar convictions, and they mentally rot in a
cauldron of closed-mindedness.” This typifies
the civil‘ rights issue as a frustrating war of
prejudice versus prej u-dice.

True, Negroes -deserve their civil rights, and
the recent demonstrations may be functional.
But why were they done? Where is the princi-
pal? How noble, unselfish, and humanitarian a
gesture was it?

And if it is principle which motivates these
students, why don’t they ventu-re to uproot the
insideous, subtle racial prejudice in the North?

Student Urges
Work at Home

Editor, The Pitt News:

Rather than be misunderstood
later in this letter, I would like
to state now that I am ﬁlled with
admiration for the students who
participated in the demonstra-
tions in Alabama. It took a cer-
tain kind of cour.age for the ones
who were really motivated by
human principles to make the
sacriﬁce they did.

I would like to remind all of
us, however, that there is more
to the civil rights movement than
bus rides to the “cradle of seg-
regation.” The guts of the civil
rights movement is found in peo-
ple who may never be involved
in the publicity of a nationally
covered demonstration. It is found
in the person who dedicates every
moment of his life to the “ig-
noble” tasks as well as to the
more glorious ones.

Such tasks as ﬁghting segre-
gation in the campus area; pack-
ing food and clothing so that
they can be sent south, and
working with the second class
citizens of the Hill District in
Pittsburgh, Pa., are just as im-
portant to the furtherance of
civil rights as the more ‘exciting
ones.

It takes a diﬂerent kind of
courage, but courage nonethe-
less, to commit oneself to work
of this kind. Granted it is im-
portant for us to participate in
Southern demonstrations, but this
should not be where our com-
mitment ends.

If any good can be gleaned
from the speech made by Rabbi
Rubenstein last‘ Friday, it is to
cause us to examine our motives
for participating in the struggle
for civil rights. If our motives
are those of personal glory and
headline grabbing—then we are
not committed to the cause of
civil rights.

If we as Northemers, most of
us white, see ourselves as lead-
ers of downtrodden Negroes, ﬁght-
ing for a goal they want rather
than ﬁghting with .them for a

goal we both want——then we are

not committed to the cause of
civil rights.

The true leaders of this move-
ment, such as Martin Luther
King, Jr. and James Forman,
have in the past, and continue
in the present to work out the
shape of the protest desired by
the people they lead without
calling each other names.

They are the leaders of this
movement because day in .and
day out they have put in the
kind of drudge work mentioned
above; day in and day out they
have stood with their people;
they have been beaten and have
gone to jail with their people.
When they ask us to participate
in a civil rights demonstration on
their terms, we are doing no
more in a single day than they
and their people do every mo-
ment of their lives.

Let us look within ourselves
and see what our motives really
are in working for the cause of
civil rights; then let us look
around us to see the job that
has to be done—in the South,
and also in Pittsburgh.

The University Chapl.ain’s As-
sociation, representing the rec-
ognized campus ministries of all
faiths at the University of Pitts-
burgh, applauds and approves
the spirit which has been evident
on our campus during the past
two weeks. We not only admire
the courage and enthusiasm of
those students who went to Ala-
bama, but we are also grateful
for the enlightened and compas-
sionate way in which the total
University, from administration
to student body, reacted to their
going and to the issues involved.

We believe that the purpose
of higher education is to mold
the structures of our society and
not merely to reﬂect them. We
further believe that the educated
man is not merely one who has
mastered techniques and skills,
but one who continually seeks a
framework of meaning, a pers-
pective for living. Inasmuch as
the events of the past two weeks

have focused attention not only

on the civil rights question, but

also on “the University question,”
we see it as an expression of
hope and possibility.

We trust that the present spir-
it will neither dissipate nor focus
itself on frivolous matters. While
dramatic, periodic and symbolic
events are most important, there
is also a desperate need for con-
tinuing involvement and persis-
tent leadership on the part of
the University, its administration,
faculty and students in the af-
fairs of our society and world.

If the whole man and whole
society are to enjoy the maxi-
mum beneﬁts from the pursuit of
knowledge that takes place with-
in the structure of the Universi-
ty, then the University and its

AN HONORABLE DECISION
If Athletic Director Frank Carver is a man of honor,
wrestling will not deteriorate after coach Rex Peery re-
signs. '

 

“Peery worked to make wrestling a top sport here,” i

said Carver, “and now Pitt wrestling teams are a top at-
traction. I’m not going to let it go down hill,” he concluded.

SINCE PEERY announced his retirement early this
season, rumors have been circulating that wrestling was
going to be deemphasized. Several reliable sources said that
either baseball coach Bob Lewis or soccer coach Leo Bemis
would be the next mat coach. ‘

 
  
   

 

COACH REX Peery shouts to wrestler to show some hustle during
this season. Peery retires as wrestling coach this month.

 

Both Lewis and Bemis, however, -have limited experi-

ence in wrestling and it would be a travesty to appoint

_ _ either as head coach. Lewis admits, “my wrestling experi-
C...  - ence is limited to observing and following the sport.”

BOTH COACHES are also burdened with other jobs.
Lewis supervises Trees Hall Pool, and Bemis faces a top
challenge in improving the Intramural program.

“The only reason Lewis or Bemis would become coach is
if we were in a pinch,” Carver said, scoffing at rumors.
But Carver does not anticipate a pinch.

Although Carver refuses to consider an appointment
until the NCAA tournament ends (March 27), he already

: has between 15 and 20 applications. Applicants include high
school coaches, small college coaches, assistant coaches, and
_l ~ several well-established mentors. There is no lack of talent.

BUT, WHAT about money, and the recent ﬁnancial di-

lemma of the university? No problem, says Carver. “We
are willing to offer a good starting salary, and a job as a
part-time instructor,” said Carver. “We’re .trying to get
either a young man or a weH-established coach.”
_ The ﬁeld house seems like a rumor clinic now, instead
 * of an. athleticfacility. Wrestlers, athletes, coaches, and the
publicity director toss names around _like they were play-
ing scrabble.

Prominent names such as Yale coach Ed Campbell,

« Princeton coach John Johnston, and former Panther star
-.-.._._. Dave Johnson are but a few. Campbell, a native of Pitts-

burgh, says he has not been approached.

BUT BOTH Carver and Peery continue to incite the
gossip. “Our top candidate is presently a coach at another
school and he is fairly well-established,” said Carver, as if
narrating a television quiz show. “I’ve made my recommen-

.—._-, dation,” said Peery, “but there will be no definite decision
until this spring.”

Carver, however, “would rather not mention the names
of any applicants,” keeping an uneasy suspense among
wrestling fans. One alumnus made a 10 minute call from
Bethlehem, Pa. to the Pitt News Sports Office, inquiring

_ - about the situation. I hope they don’t make a. farce of the

‘ sport when Rex (Peery) resigns,” he said fervently. “If
they do, there’ll be plenty of disgrunted alumni.”

Regardless of how long this uncertainty lasts, Carver

 and he'd better 89* the Iiﬁhl?  l

A new “I” formation
highlighted the opening of
Spring Football Practice last
week at the Stadium.

“The ‘I’ formation is just
a supplement to the other of-
fensive formations,” said
John Michelosen. “We’re go-
ing to employ the ‘I’ to add
more and various running
and passing plays.”

In the “I” formation, the quar-
terback, the fullback, and one
halfback line up behind the cen-
ter, while the other halfback
positions himself on the weak
side parallel with the middle
back. ,

Although there are 67 varsity
candidates, Michelosen still lacks
depth and experience at the
guard and center positions. Find-
ing good interior lineman re-
mains his biggest problem.

“Center and guard were the
hardest hit by graduation,” Mich-
elosen said. “So when the fall
comes, there will be a lot of spots
open on the line, especially for
sophomores.”

The graduating linemen includ-
ed defensive players Marty

“(Joe) Novogratz, (Dave) Ran-

and a few good sophomores are
getting cracks at the line open-
ings,” Michelosen continued. Tam-
burino is a converted fullback.

“Right now we’re just trying
to teach them the fundamentals,
both offensively and defensively,”
Michelosen said. “We want to
see the capabilities of each boy.

because in the fall you don’t get
a chance to work on those bas-

At tackle, however, “the team
is strongest as far as numbers
go,” said Michelosen. The top
tackle candidates include Jim
Jones, Al Keiser, and Tom Ray-
mond. “But the halfback position
is our most experienced,” he said.
Halfbacks include Eric Crabtree,
Dewey Chester, Bob Dyer, Dale

last year battle freshmen Bob
Longo and Greg Keller for start-
ing berths.

“Kenny Lucas has the most ex-
perience at the quarterback post
but Ed James, (Joe) Pohl, and
freshmen, (Bob)
(Mickey) Depp, are all working
that position,” Michelosen said.
“Of course, it would be almost
improbable that a freshmen
could start."

At some spots, Michelosen must
decide who to start and at other
positions, it doesn’t matter, that
is until the opening home game
with Oregon, September 18.

Weather Puts Baseball
Practice at Field House

Bad weather has forced the baseball practice indoors,
but it has not affected the spirits of returning letterman

Barry Wetzel.

With few returning lettermen, theoutlook could easily
be pessimistic. “I’m very optimistic,” said Wetzel. “I’m
looking forward to a great season for both myself and the
team. I think we’ll have a better team than last year be-
cause of everybody’s attitu-dt and hustle.”

The team now practices on the basketball court in the
Fitzgerald Field House, but coach Bob Lewis is disappointed

with the conditions. Practic-
ing indoors has handicapped.
hitting more than anything,
because it’s difficult to judge
hitting accuracy in the bat-
ting cage. .

“They all look excellent when
ﬁelding,” said Lewis. “If we
could play all our games indoors
on the basketball court, we could

beat anybody. The arms are in

pretty good shape and every-
thing’s set to go outside.” Every-
thing, that is, except the weather.

Since space is limited in the
ﬁeld house, Lewis has had to cut
some sophomore prospects. Ex-
cept for catcher, ﬁrst base, and
second base, he has not made
deﬁnite selections.

Doug Chambers will be the
starting catcher again, and Steve-
Eisman will probably play second
base. The only major change
concerns Wetzel, who moves from
his outﬁeld position to ﬁrst base.
Senior Bruan Fisher played ﬁrst
base last year.

Wetzel was the team’s second
leading batter last year with .317
average, and Lewis expects him
to improve. “It all depends on
the start he gets. If he gets off
on a good one, he should have
no trouble in raising his aver-
age.” said Lewis.

Wetzel admits he is a little
rusty at ﬁrst base, but he did
play the position in high school.
“I think I'm going to get off to a
better start this year,” Wetzel
said. “I’m relaxed now, whereas
I was pressing too much at the
start last year.

Ten players are still compet-
ing for six openings on the pitch-

ing squad.’ Letterman Dave Bly_- -

ready won starting berths. The
top six pitchers will probably
start in the first days of the sea-
son when the Panthers play eight
games.

If the weather breaks by April
1, Lewis will be satisﬁed. “All
we’ll need is three good weeks
outdoors,” ‘he said. “We’re ready
now for the intra-squad games.”

New Building.
Helps Foster
IM Activities-

By JAY ROSENSTHN
Intramural Director Leo
Bemis plans to use the new
Physical Education building
to allieviate intramural

problems and to expand pop-
ular programs.

“Of course,” Bemis said, “all
decisions on expansion will de-
pend on the amount of time and
interest that the students have.
I can say though, that we will be
able to do a much better job with
our new basketball courts than
we did at the inadequate stadium
gal.”

The intramural program will
have three basketball courts
available at all times except
when the freshman basketball
team holds afternoon practices.
Then two of the courts will be
open for practice and play, ac-
cording to Bemis. “And if the
women’s courts are not in use,”
he added, “we will use them.”

“In general, the bigger basket-
ball facility will provide a much
better environment in which to
play, although the participants
will have to make an adjustment
in their style of play due to the
longer and wider courts,” Bemis
continued.

The game of paddle ball may
become an intramural s port.
“With the favorable exposure
that paddle ball has received in
this year’s physical education
classes, and with the new courts
to be available, we probably will
add it to our schedule,” said Be-
mis. ,

Badminton may also become
an intramural sport. Bemis said
that “the new badminton courts
were made to be used.” In addi-
5011. Bemis anticipates the com-
Dletion of the new outdoor play-
ing ﬁelds for the expansion of
the softball, football, and soccer
Programs.

Arrangements for evening bus
service to and from the build-
ing will be made for the fall tri-
mester. Bemis hopes this added
luxury will attract more partici-

watched a Yale man toss out a 55 footer.

Jim was sprawling against an idle high-hurdle in the
center of the arena at Madison Square Garden. He had just
failed to meet qualify‘ for the ﬁnals of the shot put in the

IC4A meet.

Not being one of the best was
a new experience for Flanigan,
who is the best shot putter on the
track squad and the top line-
backer on the football team. But
he took the defeat with a ma-
ture attitude that few college
sophomores possess.

Ill high school, Jim won the
WPIAL javelin competition, and
his state record for the 12-pound
shot put has stood for the past
two years. In addition, Jim was
elected to the all-WPIAL and the
all-state football teams as a full-
back in his senior year. Track
Coach Carl Rees thinks Flani-
gan could be the best javelin
thrower in‘ the state, but he has
not competed in the event, and
will not do so until the outdoor
season begins in April. I

Flanigan is the only person _

who would say that Jim Flanigan
was terrible. And when he says
terrible, he means he did not win
his event. Everyone else has
nothing but praise for the giant
athlete. He is well-liked _by both
his track and football teammates,
and is as quick at returning a
joke as he is at stopping an op-
posing ballcarrier.

Backﬁeld Coach Bimbo Cec-
coni feels that Flanigan is more

than a normal athlete. “At 6’3” '

and 225 pounds, Jim has the phy-
sical tools to be a good athlete.
But he augments this. with a tre-

mendous amount of desire to sue ~

ceed. Jim has that attribute foot-

ball coaches want in a player-— ,

he loves to hit people.”

Flanigan echoed this statement
when he admitted he got a thrill
from bowling over an opposing
tackler and would rather "blast"
a ballcarrier than wrestle him
to the ground.

Flanigan seems like a shy per-
son, but this conception slowly
changes, and you realize that he
is not agressive, simply a well-
conditioned athlete.

He knows .exactly what he
wants in life, and is systemati-
cally tackling the obstacles. He
wants to attend Dental school
and to play professional football.
If desire produces results, Jim

Flanigan will have both of his _

goals in his pocket in the not-
too-distant future.
