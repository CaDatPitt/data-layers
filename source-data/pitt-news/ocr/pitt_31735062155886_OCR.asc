that although the administration had not as yet given its
approval, the athletic department did favor it as a means of

increasing school spirit.

Norma Jurso corresponding sec-

sage from Capt. Tom Hamilton,
director of athletics, which also
agreed that women cheerleaders
would help to increase school spir-
it. He said that if the proposal
were to go through, there would

be no problem of sponsorship, but,
the approval of the student body
as well as the administration was
needed.

Glory Discussed

A freshmen Council representa-
tive said that some women would
go out for cheerleading only \for
the glory. But the Pitt Pistol qual-
iﬁcations for cheerleaders were
read as evidence that this would
not occur.

The point scale system was also
discussed. Some women felt that
it would not be adequate to in-
clude cheerleaders.

» E il e e n Reinwasser suggested
that women who would not go out
for any other activity might be in-
terested in cheerleading. There-
fore, the point scale system would
be suitable.

1 Dean Rush’s View

Dean Helen Poole Rush express-
ed the opinion, that if the~women
voted to support the proposal they
would be yielding a point to Stu-
dent Congress. -

Barbara Douglas, Transfer com-
mittee chairman, said, “It is not
a question of yielding to Student
Congress, but merely giving an
opinion to SC.”

In voicing her own opinion, Pat
Ritz said that men and women
have, both separate and united
places in the University. In previ-
ous statements, Miss Ritz said, she

Don Kettering, Delta Sigma

Interfraternity Council Wed-
nesday night in an election
that smacked of the old days
of intrigue and partisan politics in
that group.

Kettering nosed out Joe Tratt-

IF vice president by a danger-
ously narrow margin. His election

climaxed weeks of politicking be-
tween two strong factions that
have grown on the Pitt scene this
year. , .

The balloting presented a mark-
ed contrast to last year's elections
when Elmer Shuster and Trattner

were unanimously elected Presi-
dent and vice president respec-
tively. Kettering had a ﬁght on

for all of the women in the Uni-
versity, but in this instance she
felt that she must give her per-
sonal opinion. '

Miss Ritz stated that she voted
in favor of putting the cheerlead-
ing proposal before the adminis-
tration, first, to let them talk it
over and air. their opinions.

“Lose Femininity”

-Against women cheerleaders was
Patty Goldberg, Guild chairman}
who said that women would lose
their feminity as cheerleaders.
Miss Goldberg went on to say at
a later time that cheerleading is
not apropriate for mature women.

In reply to Miss Goldberg’s ﬁrst
statement, Judy Gotterer, Vade
Mecum editor said,.“A good cheer-
leader has grace and dignity, and
therefore, does not lose her fem-
ininity.”

SC Proposal .

The entire discussion and later
vote was the result of the SC pro-
posal for a women’s cheerleading
program. In the proposal, three
purposes are given:

First, that it will aid the Uni-
versity and its student body by in-
creasing school spirit‘and student
enthusiasm. '

Second, the integration of wom-
en into the cheerleading program‘
will result in a better quality of
cheers, cheerleading, and student

Not To Be Outdlme

A Tree Grows in Basement  

By ART WELDY

. There’s a tree growing in Brook-
lyn, of course, but there‘s an even
larger, more elaborate one that
has been “growing” in an alcove
of the basement of the Cathedral
of Learning for the past ﬁve
Weeks.

The tree at Pitt is‘ a prop, and;

a rather remarkable prop, for the
Pitt Player production, “The Grass
Harp,” which will be presented on
Mar. 18, 19, and 20 in Stephen
Foster Memorial.

This particular piece of stage
setting is the brainchild of Mr.
Lloyd Welden, J r., technical direc-
tor of the Pitt Players. After
spending three weeks on the prob-
lem over a drawing board, accord-
ing to Mr. Welden, he ﬁnally gave
up in desperation and spent an-
other two weeks working on the
tree in the scene shop.

Home-Made Tree

A conglomeration of two by
fourfs, chicken wire, canvas, news-
paper, and a generous splattering
of paint, the tree extends more
than six feet into a tree house and
seven feet beyond that.

Welden, who has attended ﬁve
colleges and has spent nine years
in scenery production, considers
this particular job the most dif-
ficult he has ever encountered.

Since the tree plays an integral
part in the plot of “The Grass
Harp,” it has to be sturdy enough
to withstand the action which
takes part around it and in the
tree house perched in its branches.
At one point in the play there are
‘six people in it at the same time.

Mobile Prop

Because the prop must be mo-
bile, it could not be constructed
in the middle of the stage. “That
would have been easy,” accord-
ing to Welden. Instead, it had to
be built on two wagons, each six
feet in length, so that in a mat-
ter of minutes the stage can be
changed from an interior living
room setting to an outdoor scene.

Welden invites all students in-

Men’s Council
Hunting New
Advisory Set-up

Men’s Council announced re-
cently that 35 per cent of the reg-
ularly enrolled students at Pitt
have never met with a faculty ad-
visers. I

This statement is based on an
impartial survey compiled by a
special projects committee head-
_ed by Yalea—Rosenstein and Don
Gartner. '

The survey further showed that
only 20 per cent ‘have seen their
advisers more than once and that
fully" 50 per cent were not satis-
ﬁed with the results of the inter-
views. If a more efficient advisory
system were set up, twice as many
students would meet with advis-
ers, according to the survey.

In addition to the survey at Pitt,
letters of inquiry were sent to
various other universities such as
Temple, Columbia, and Ohio

. State.

Men’s Council plans to combine
the data gathered at Pitt with
that from other schools and pre-
sent a proposed plan of improve-
ment for the present advisory set-
up to the Senate Committee on
Student-Faculty Relations.

. When WSGA ‘voted their disapproval of Student_ Con-
gress’s women cheerleader proposal it proved several things:
1) WSGA is not representative of the women at Pitt since
a referendum proved that the women favored coed cheer-
leaders; 2) That WSGA was inﬂuenced in its decision by
Miss Rush and several students who are obviously afraid
to buck the dean of women;-3) That Student Congress will
get nowhere unless they go ahead on their own and dispense
with the silly, stupid, hedging tactics they employed after

’ the conclusive proof of the referendum favoring women

cheerleaders. '

” They had their student opinion which they desired
and which was supposed to be the go-ahead signal.
Then they actually admitted that they "did not think

, their own referendum was conlusive evidence or valid
basis for initiating the program when they submitted
the question to campus organizations in a needless and
senseless duplication of opinion. .

Perhaps it was considerate of them to seek the appro-

it val of-these groups and try to cooperate with WSGA and

the administration, but Wednesday night’s silly little ses-
sion proved the fallacy of trying to please everybody." One_

. girl in WSGA said that women cheerleaders were “high

s_choolish.” I can name 50 colleges and universities in the
country who have very excellent, very popular, and very
much approved “high schoolish” activities. That opinion
itse1f_is a mark of immaturity since there is nothing de-
grading or unfeminine or unladylike in a trained, attractive

,coed leading a student body in a demonstration of school

spirit. ’ c
If the women’s program here is designed to give
coeds‘ a more equal footing with the men who out-
number them ﬁve to one, this is certainly an extremely
odd way to prove it. Cheerleading is an acceptable,
recognized coed activity that is in no waydegrading.
,If some coeds have the talent and desire to participate ,
in this, there is no reason why they should be prohibit-'
ed any more they should‘ not be allowed to engage in
ﬁeld hockey, riﬂe teams, and other women’s athletics
and activities.

The ath1etic‘department has stated that they will fur-
nish the uniforms and equipment necessary. to the cheer-
leading program. They have denied oﬂicial jurisdiction over
the program as ha.ve the dean of men’s and women’s of-
ﬁces and the women’s athletic department. If none of these
administrative departments will accept the responsibility
then they cannot legally or morally veto the plan. If they
are in this position, it is up to Student Congress, the stu-
dent governing body of the University of Pittsburgh, to
take command of the situation and see it through under
their own authority——an authority they keep saying they
have and want more of but fail to use when it is within
their power. I ‘

Student Congress attempted to include WSGA in
its plans and the idea fell ﬂat. The older girls either
hedged on the issue or resorted, under pressure and

By John De Ninno

The fact that many people in this country are
weeping and wailing that a major depression is
just: around the corner, tends to substantiate a
belief that has existed for years, that our country
can be prosperous only when engaged in a war.

Since" the _end of the Korean conﬂict the econo-
my of he nation ‘has been threatened by lay—offs
and cut—backs in important in-

dustries (i.e. automobile, steel).
When people in such -industries
are not working,‘ they aren’t
bringing home pay checks, there
is less money to spend, and thus
the other industriesmust suffer.
When these people do work our
economy rides at a comparative-

 

Econon\y Flirctuated

The economy has ﬁuctuated like this ever since
the nation was founded, except for major depres-
sions, the last being approximately 25 years ago

soon after a war had ended and when a Republi-

can president was in office.

. Now history seems to be repeating itself, a
war has ended recently, a Republican is in the
White House, so the logical conclusion some peo-
ple draw is that a depression is on the way. As a
matter of fact if there isn’t one coming, and who
can say for certain that there isn’t, they are go-
ing to see that one does by talking themselves

 

Can Peace Bring Prosperity? 

Industry Controls Fate

The Democratic Party in ‘its attempt to wind

a majority in Congress this year are using the
theme of 'a' depression threat as an issue. The
people who are unemployed at .the moment will
no doubt go_ along with this. Some. industrial

leaders are sitting back, tapping‘ their ﬁngers to- .
gether and watching the nation go down the drain. ,

The fate of the nation, economically, is in the
hands of ‘these men. ..

If we as a nation are to ever prove that werare
not dependent on government created boom and
bust economy, industry must work, creating new
markets, producing steadily improved commodi-
ties. '

A War Economy? , \

In 1950 when .approximately twice as many
people were unemployed the same people who
now cry_. depression called it a necessary read-
justment until the Korean War sent the economy
sky high. Perhaps it -would please those “solid

Americans” if we enter another war and more '

Americans die. Sure we had record years, dur-
ing the war, as far as income is concerned, but
our military cemeteries were ﬁlling
same time. v

It is a sad state of affairs when one political
party will incest the people with the dread fear
of a depression for purely reasons of personal gain.

country than a slump in employment could ever

Students» Scared Away,

SC Starts

By lrv Rothman

In answer to complaints con-
cerning a “pathetic” intramural
sports program at Pitt, Student
Congress has established a spe-
cial committee headed by John
Perri, Col. ’54, to investigate the
current - sports situation.

Perri claims that while a great

them, a large number of Pittites

that instructors and/or managers

Students who wanted to obtain

that the ﬁeld house is open Sat-

Perri called the

Covering more territory on the
IM program, the ri1ed—up SC
appointee, said he had been
thrown out of the Pitt stadium
basketball iﬂoor once, when one
of the field house attendants
wanted to leave early.

Poll Started

However, Perri realized that
his views are well his own. To
ﬁnd out if other students have
suffered similar experiences, and
to discover what students want,
Perri: and .his committee have
started a student poll. He and
Bob Maloney, ,SC representative,
are in the process of interviewing
up to 1,000 male students. Malo-
ney’s sub-committee is interview-
ing fraternity nembers, while‘ the
chairman works with independ-
ent opinions. ,

The poll sheets’ request the
name of the student and his class.
A sample of questions being
asked on the P911 sheets are as

follows: Are you a member of
a fraternity? Do you roomin or
near Oakland? Do you usually
stay in Pgh. over the weekends?
Would you use the Field House
if it were available on week-
nights, Saturdays, or Sunday
afternoons? W h a t activities
w o u 1 (1 you like -- basketball,
s q u a s h handball, volleyball,
horseshoes, and ping pong?
Sample Question- “

To ﬁnd out how well informed
the students are of the program,
the committee asks, “Did you

A know that the Field House was

available every week night, Sat-
urday and Sunday afternoons?”
Space is provided on the back
of the poll form for added com-
ments, and says Perri, “They’re
ﬁery and revealing, so far.” "He

stated that students ‘have been‘

very willing to answer the ques-
tions, and “some have had the
same experiences with intra-
mural facilities as I have had.”
T he , Intra—lVIural committee
chairman expressed final views,
“If we pay $12 activities fee, we

"should be able to use the facili-

ties.”

That should be good news for

‘College Quiz Bowl’

Pittites To Be Panelists

.Five Pitt students will be guest

panelists on NBC Radio’s “College
Quiz Bowl,” Sunday, Mar. 21, on
KDKA.
/ This is one form of intercol-
legiate competition in which the
emphasis is on brains instead of
the conventional brawn. The show
has gained the recognition of be-
ing one of the toughest, yet ‘en-
tertaining, quiz shows on the air
since its introduction in 1953.

Although the quiz itself covers
a wide range of subjects, it is pri-
marily designed» to test the gen-
eral knowledge of the, liberal arts
undergraduate, touching mostly on‘

‘sports, history, music, and current

aﬂ’airs.
One section of the ‘program is
reserved for the “tossups” in

which the lirst team toanswer re-
ceives points. An electronic signal-
ing device indicates to moderator
Allen Lu.dden which fteam is ready
to answer ﬁrst.

Columbia and Northwestern
were the universities represented
on the initial. broadcast of “Col-
lege Quiz Bowl.” Northwestern
‘won this match and went on to de-
feat two other foes, earning a to-
tal of $l,500,be'lTore the’ winning
streak was ended by Minnesota.

Student panelists on the College
Quiz Bowl will be Albert Hilger,
Morton Coleman, Elinore Stone,
Samuel Seigle, seniors in the Col-
lege, and Elizabeth Ann Young,
junior in Education.

Sues for $1,000

A student recently sued the
University of Colorado for $1000.
The reason; mental distraction
caused by the ringing of bells. It
seemed that the ringing of “these
nasty, noxious things” caused him
great mental distraught.

It had been reported that he had
become "ill—tempered” since the
bells first began to ring. A Uni-
versity psychologist testiﬁed at the

hearing that “prolonged stimula-

tion could have such. effects.”

The student stated, “The noxious
bells . . . distract me while I work,
disturb my work, schedule, and
have caused me great mental and
emotional damage.”

Despite such supporting evi-
dence, however, the student lost
the case—before the campus mock

school upon her graduation from
the School of Pharmacy.

‘Supremacy in 1st Effort

By DAVE MAZER

America’s oldest collegiate \wrestling association holds
its Golden Jubilee tournament today and tomorrow and they
may start their second ﬁfty years with a newcomer to the

championship.

Coach Rex Peery’sl power-packed matmen, in their ﬁrst
year of competition in the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling

. Association, are favored as the squad most likely to, win at
Itahaca,¢

Cornell University at

years. .

N. Y.

They posted a 9-1 record dur-
ing the regular season.

Lions Defenders

The Panthers, admitted to the
eonference when the University of
Virginia dropped out last year,
grapple against 120 men from 15
other colleges in the two-day meet
starting this afternoon.

Rated as the team to beat by
Coach Peery, however, is Penn

,State. The Lions are national as

well as Eastern defending champs
and will be shooting _for their
fourth straight EIWA crown.

The mat mentor feels that even
though Pitt racked up the Nittan-
ies in a dual meet, they were not
at top strength and were probably
content to lose the dual match and
go all out for the Easterns.

_ Sixteen Entries
Two other schools, Lehigh and
Navy, are also considered main

‘ contenders. The rest of the ﬁeld is

made up of Army, Brown, Colum-
bia, Cornell, Franklin and Mar-
shall, H a r vva r d , Pennsylvania,
Princeton, R u t g e‘r s , Syracuse,
Temple, and Yale.

Leading the Panther entry is
senior Hugh Peery, a 123-pounder.
[The son of the Pitt coach, has won

40 matches in a row and has an .

overall varsity record of 44 wins
in 45 matches.

Two other graduating matmen
are in the traveling aggregation.

.George Matthews, who won some
crucial matches that helped the:
Panthers over the hump in tight,

meets and Charley Uram, who was
undefeated during the regular
season and lost only twice in dual
meets in three varsity years, are
entered in the 137 and 147-pound
classes, respectively. '
Four Panthers Unbeaten

In the 130 division, iunior Bill
Kozy who shifted down from 137
and appears stronger, carries the
Panther hopes.

In the 157 class, soph Ed De-
witt, another undefeated wrestler,
goes after his tenth triumph while
junior Joe Solomon carries the

At stake will be the Eastern ‘Collegiate Swimming Cham-
pionship which the Pitt tankers have captured the last two

years.

Although most observers feel
the Panthers should have, no
trouble in smothering all oppo-
sition, Coach Ben Grady remains
pessimistic. ’

Grady insists that all the teams
will be tough this year, especially
Lehigh, CCNY, NYU, and Kings
Point. Lehigh was rated to give
Grady’s boys their roughest oppo-
sition; but then the Pittites hum-
bled Lehigh’s tankers 54-23 in the
last dual. meet
of the regular
season.

Grady, how-
ever, contends
t h a t “Lehigh
wasn’t familiar
with the PAA
pool and it can
be a tough pool
to s w i m if
you’re, not .used
to it.” '

As to h i s

team’s outlook in the champion-
ship meet, Grady said, “The boys
are in good physical condition
and you can bet on one thing——
we’lLbe in there doing our best
to win.”

Nothing Like
A Good Fight

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

 

How unfortunate that Frank Leahy did not level his
charges against the Big Ten and the NCAA rules committee
over radio or TV.

Then, like Senator McCarthy, the grand inquisitor, the
chastened parties could plead for equal air time to voice
their rebuttals—with a highly entertaining result.

There is nothing like a hot controversy to shake old
skeletons out of the closet. Accusations and recriminations
bring to light things that ordinarily escape the probings
of a routine "investigation. ’

Revealing Outcome

For example, as a result of the sucker shift and injury-
feigning ruckus, we can now read in Look magazine all
about Notre Dame’s scholarship setup, the inducements of-
fered to players, and coaching temperament—and all of it
tendered voluntarily by Leahy.

Now, if the Western Conference schools should care to
bare their souls, we might get an accurate idea of how
other major powers maintain their grid prestige. The whole
affair would have a healthy effect upon the game, a bene-
ﬁcial sort of self-policing not possible under toothless rules.

But it is doubtful whether any oﬂicial of the Big Ten
will argue publicly with the astute Leahy, who worded his
criticisms carefully. He did not name any school outright,
referr' g only to “more aﬁluent” members of the Confer-
ence, but any such member who takes offense naturally be-

Electricals Overcome

B’s, 59-35; Jets Win

By STEVE BUTCHOCK ~
The Electricals moved into second place in the En-
gineering League with a thumping 59-35 victory over the
Civi1“‘B” entry at the Stadium Wednesday. The “B’s” were

forced to play with only four players throughout the second
and third periods due to injuries. ¢

   

trays guilt by doing so.

Blame the Irish
r The wrist-slapping Leahy ‘received for use of “illegal”
shifts, incidentally, contains a somewhat amusing element
for those of us atPitt. Poor Notre Dame had to take the
blame for employing a maneuver Red Dawson used when

Pitt beat them.

Thinclads Get Chance for New

Laurels at Milwaukee Games

With national laurels at
companies ﬁve thinclads to

A
V

stake, Coach Carl Olson ac-
the Milwaukee indoor games

tomorrow night.

Pitt will have two entries as the
two-mile relay team and high
hurdler Wally Monahan compete.
The relay squad is composed of
Dan Sommer, Chuck Fritz, Don
Delli Gatti, and Arnie Sowell. ,

The ‘relay event is an invita-
tional one with Pitt drawing one
of four bids. Other schools asked
were Michigan, Michigan State,
and Indiana.

All Big-Timers

As Olson says, “They must con-
sider us pretty good to invite us,
since those other three colleges are
the best in the mid-west.”

Monahan also meets tough. go-
lng as he faces the top men in the
Big Ten in his event.

Last year, the Panther track-
men took a second place in the
Milwaukee Games as the mile re-
lay team lost out only to Michigan.

Finish With K-C

Just recently this season, both
the two-milers and Monahan took
runnerup honors at the IC4A’s
meet in New York.

After this outing, the thinclads
wind up the winter indoor cam-
paign by an appearance at the
Knights‘ of Columbus Meet next
weekend at Cleveland.

Leading by a 5-2 score late in the
initial stanza, the winners, sparked
by sharpshooting John Petula,
garnered three quick ﬁeld goals
against the depleted forces of the
opposition, which enabled them to
hold a 11-2 advantage at the quar-
ter. '

The aggressive EE’s relied most-
ly on a collapsing defense in an
attempt to prevent the game from
turning into a rout. Showing no
signs of giving up, the Electri-
cians outscored the ﬁghting “B”
aggregation by only one point in
the second period, pushing the
halftime score to 23-13 in their
favor.

Out of Reach

The Electricals’ oﬁense worked
to perfection in the third period
which netted 22 points. They hit
with uncanny accuracy while hold-
ing their opponents to a mere nine
tallies. The burden of the attack
was carried by Orville Bradford,
Bernie Sikora, and Petula.

At full strength again, the fourth
stanza found the “B’s” putting up
stronger opposition, but the game
was now in complete command as
the Electricals coasted to their
fourth win of the campaign.

Petula gained scoring honors
with 16 markers. He was followed
by Bradford and Sikora who each
sank twelve. Norm paced the
losers with 14 points.

Jets Win Fifth

In another contest, the Johns-
town Jets moved into ﬁrst place in 1
