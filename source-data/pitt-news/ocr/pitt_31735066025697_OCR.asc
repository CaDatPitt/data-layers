In an attempt to help students
understand the political language in the
Student Government Board’s weekly
reports, SGB member Damon Hudac
said the board should begin making
clear explanations of its reports’ mean-
ings.

When Hudac was called by Board
President Alyson Wallach to present his
report, he
pushed his
chair back,
stood to allow
everyone in
the room to
see him, and
read his
points, fol-
lowing each

The seven other board members
read their reports no differently from
usual, though, staying seated in their
chairs and not explaining the meaning
of their words. ‘

After the meeting, Hudac said he’d
hoped the group would give layman’s
explanations. "It'll just take them a little
while to get used to it," he said

According to Wallach, none of the
board members took Hudac's sugges-
tion last night because they only heard
his idea that day and'_ already had their
reports written.

She added that’ the board will
improve the clarity of its reports in the
future but said an added explanation
like Hudac's isn't necessarily required.

"Certainly we want to make stu-
dents aware of how these decisions
affect them," said Wallach. "I feel their
reports in and of themselves should do
that. I hope they become much more
clear."

"If people could pay me to go

But the students’ immersion in
their research isn’t the only benefit of

of feedback on the students. They
often say that the students‘ enthusiasm

Undergraduate students must devote
massive amounts of time to their pro-

always arise.

"Research takes time and commit-

According to Koehler, undergrad-

important in the learning process. _

"It's a wonderful experience for
both the teacher and the student.
When someone's heart is in a particu-

Across the Nation

CAPITOL HILL —— President Clinton
says, “Save Social Security ﬁrst.”

The president is calling for “every
penny” of the anticipated federal budget sur-
plus to be put aside until the Social Security
system is strengthened.

During his State of the Union Address,
Clinton said he wants a “true consensus”
from Americans on how to save Social
Security.

He said that nonpartisan forums will be
held throughout the country and that aWhite
House conference on Social Security will be
held in December.

Clinton also said that one year from
now, he will call on Congress to draft legis-
lation making sure that the Social Security
system will be strong in the next century.

He said the keys to a quality education
are good teachers and small class sizes, so
he’s proposing the ﬁrst-ever national elfort to
reduce the size of elementary school classes.

Clinton said his balanced budget will
enable the hiring of 100,000 new teachers.
With the new teachers, ﬁrst, second, and
third grades would have an average of 18
students per class. _ ' .

Clinton also is proposing ‘a schoo1-con-
struction tax cut that he says will help mod-
emize or build 5,000 schools.

Additionally, he wants schools to stop
the so-called “social promotion” of students.

Concerning higher education, Clinton
says ﬁnancial hardship is no excuse not to go
to college. He says ﬂztere is enough help out
there to make college as universal as high
school.

PORTLAND, Ore. — A married former
high-school drama instructor says he had a
ﬁve—year sexual relationship with former
White House intern Monica  She's
the woman at the center of thescandal sur-
rounding President Clinton.

Andy Bleiler, who now lives in

' Portland, says he’s known Lewinsky for sev-

eral years. Bleiler says their relationship
went back to the late 1980s when shewas a
student at Beverly Hills High School in
Southern California.

Bleiler told reporters outside his home
that Lewinsky had bragged of another aﬂ’air
with a “high—ranking federal ofﬁcial.”

Lewinsky is the 24-year-old former
White House intern who allegedly had an
affair with Clinton. The" President denies
having had sexual relations with Lewinsky,
or asking her to lie about it.

CHICAGO — Fears that the polio vaccine
distributed in the 1950s and early 1960s
could cause cancer are being eased _

Millions of Americans were given the
polio vaccine, which was contaminated with
a monkey virus.

It was feared they could face an
increased risk of some rare cancers because
the virus caused cancer in lab animals.

But a study published in The Journal of
the American Medical Association says the
incidence of the cancers is not signiﬁcantly
higher among those who received the conta-
minated vaccine.

WASHINGTON —— The United States
would target suspected chemical-weapons
sites as well as key military units if there’s a

- decision to attack Iraq.

The Pentagon’s chief spokesman
Kenneth Bacon says military tmits that help
keep SaddamHusseininpowerwouldbeon
the list of targets.

Bacon also says there would be a “deci-
sive and devastating” response if Iraq wae
to use chemical or biological weapons it
may have.

When asked whether that might include
ﬂie use of nuclear weapons, Bacon replied,
“I don’t think we’ve ruled anything in or
out.”

Iraq has refused to give UN weapons
inspectors access to all sites they’ve askedto
see. They’re checking to see whether Iraq is
hiding weapons of mass destruction.

George Bandik, a chemistry professor.
Koehler cited a study done by one
Pitt professor who divided his course
in half, giving one half to a graduate
student teaching assistant and splitting
the other half into groups of six, each
led by undergraduate teaching assis-
tants. The groups of six students led
by undergraduate teaching assistants
performed better in the class.
"Attendance at [undergraduate
TAs’] recitations was better and stu-
dents learned the material better
because they had a chance to partici-
pate and explain problems. Overall,

the students got more out of that expe-
rience," Koehler said.

And it’s that experience — that
knowledge — which everyone says
drives them.

reservations about the Semester at Sea trip
she plans to undertake. She said the dan-
ger that Semester at Sea students encoun-
tered in Egypt last November wouldn’t
deter her, and that she was taking all the
variables into account. «

"I'd like to study abroad. I think you
need to keep an open mind. There are cer-

experience they had in Egypt probably
taught them a lot about world politics."

‘ “We knew we had to do something,”
said Gerry Kvortekp of Parking and
Transportation Services. “We acted fast to
put the extra shuttle on.”

But it wasn’t enough.

More complaints came in over the
course of the semester, and the department
was forced to add another shuttle.

The new shuttle, called the "Upper
Campus" shuttle, follows the Sutherland
Express shuttle up the hill between 3:30 p.m.
and 9:30 pm, reducing the previous student
load on one shuttle.

‘ The extra bus began taking people up
the hill Monday, beginning its six-week trial
run. »

kind of ridership we get on the second bus,”

said Kvortek

The extra shuttle ﬁlls the gap between
8:30 p.m. and 9:40 p.m. that had been a
problem for many students.

“It was crazy before,” said Gatens.

Gatens said she is mainly concerned

. about students being dangerously crowded

into the shuttles, while those who didn’t ﬁt
end up late for class. In response to those
concerns, she and Sutherland Resident
Director Leslie Ross met with
Transportation officials and lobbied -for
some changes.

Ross, who rides the shuttle three times a»
day, said she believes the overcrowding in
the shuttles was partially due to the increase
in students in Sutherland dorms. With the
inﬂux of a huge freshman class, Housing
had no choice but to cram many more st1.r—
dents into the Sutherland donns.

“When you have to accommodate for

that many people, changes need to be '

made,”, said Ross. «

Students say tlrey’re relieved there is an
extra shuttle but are skeptical about how
much it wﬂl help. A _

Jamie Shankweiler, a junior and resi-
dent at Sutherland Hall, said her criticism of
the shuttles concerns their schedules.

- “It was awful,” said Shankweiler,
“especially during the time that wasn’t prime
time.” —
Roy Hoﬂinan, manager of the Lenzer
Shuttle Division, the company hired by the
University to provide shuttle service, said he
thinks the extra shuttle was needed.

“I think'it’s 'gomra work,” said Hoifman.
“I think it’s something here that residents

. wanted.”

The real state
of the union

President Clinton last night didn’t address _the
scandal that holds most of our nation in a vise grip.
Instead, he focused on the issues that should be
important, even if nobody else realizes they are.

Young Americans aren’t really thinking right

now about whether they’ll have Social Security
benefits in their old age,‘ though Clinton empha-
sized fixing that program for the generations to
come before cutting any taxes-or increasing spend-
mg. . '
Most people have forgotten that Iraq’s dictator
may be drawing the U.S. into an armed conﬂict in
the very near future, but the president didn’t forget,
and made a point of telling Saddam Hussein, “You
have used weapons of mass destruction before. We
are determined to deny you thecapacity to use
them again.” V

Many parents captivated by video clips and
sound bites about sex scandals and alleged crimes
may have forgotten about their children’s education
for the time being, but their elected leader has not.
He proposed hiring 100,000 teachers to give chil-
dren smaller classrooms in renovated public
schools, . .

Those same parents may not have noticed their
teenagers’ new cigarette habits, but an unperturbed
Clinton challenged Congress to pass‘ legislation
that would raise the cost of cigarettes and penalize
tobacco "companies “if they continue marketing to

_kids.”

Even doctors and nurses have likely forgotten
about national health care legislation, but the
American president urged passage of consumer
health care protection which would guarantee the
right to appeal services when denied by an insur-
ance company.

The great majority of viewers probably paid lit—'

tle attention to all this, just waiting to see if he
would break from the plan and mention the former
White House intern whose story now threatens his
position as president, and" his country’s trust.

Addressing that scandal would only have made
everybody forget everything else he said last night.

Not that anybody was paying any attention to
that stuff anyway. '

Kiddie porn — in the bible belt

Dave

Madden

I’ve never expected much from
Oklahoma. I can’t really recall any
famous Americans who have come
ﬁorn Oklahoma, and there certainly
isn’t anything that exciting to see
there. But that doesn’t mean
Oklahoma isn’t worth paying atten-
tionto—itis, afterall,partofthe
whacked-out and decadent “bible
belt.” So after hearing about some
Oklahomans claiming Germany’s
1979 movie The Tn Drum to be

- child pornography, I had to nm out,"

rent a copy, and get to the bottom of
this latest attack on the ﬁlm’s influ-
ence on our nation’s children.

I’m not a fan of kiddie porn;
frankly, child pomographers are
some of the sickest bastards we’ve
got in this highly diversiﬁed melting
pot of a country. But I wasn’t wor-
riedatallaboutthesortofdirty
things thatwouldbe showninaﬁlm
praised by not only the world as the
best foreign ﬁlm of 1979, but more
importantly by my high school

‘The movie is long and Gennan
andartsy —not as good as was
expected, but deﬁnitely worth
watching. It took a long while to get
to the porn scene, and when it ﬁnal-
ly came on, I and my ﬁiends (to
whom I had explained the whole sit-
uation and who wereexpecting to

see some sick and twisted stuﬁ) 0

were a bit disappointed. There was

nothing sick about it at all, just a

pretty indiscreet implication of sex
between what the U.S. calls minors.

Let me explain this" movie to
everybody. The Tn Drum is about a
boy growing up in Nazi Germany
who doesn’t like the low moral life

hirnselfto stop growing because of.
it. So ‘he essentially becomes a
midget — or dwarf or whatever —
and remains three years old physi-
cally, but still continues to grow
mentally and emotionally.

.To confuse things a bit more,
the young boy who played this role
was thirteen at the time the movie"
was made, and the character he
plays is sixteen when he has sex with
his nanny, who is the same age. This
sceneistheonlythingthatcouldbe
considered pomographic: insinua-
tion of  and a slight
thrusting motion covered by some
bed sheets. Afterwards, you see rear
nudity of the boy for about 1.2 sec-
onds while he puts on his clothes.

Herein lies the problem with
calling this scene child pornography:
If I were a sicko, this movie would
be just as much of a disappointment
as movies on the USA network’s
“UpAllN1ght” inthatneitherde1iv-
er the goods. Pornography serves
one purpose and that is to help get
your kicks. Nothing in the movie is
portrayed in a way ﬂrat could arouse
anyone, regardless of sick sexual
preferences. -

Granted, pornography is in the
eye of the beholder, and some peo-
ple will easily ﬁnd this movie offen-
sive. But who gets to make that deci-

T sion for 3.2 million people — one
southem white male with views

undoubtedly similar to the group
promoting this ban? ‘ '

In their online manifesto, _ the
Oklahomans for Children and
Families (OCAF) claim that the
Oklahoma County Metropolitan

Library, who had The Tm Drum ,

available for loan to anyone, has

dren.” The policies being of course

' Now I’m the kinda guy who
digs foreign ﬁlms, but before the age
of 17 (when one is legally able to
rent or buy the movie, it having an R
rating), there was absolutely no way
you could get me to watch some
boring old German movie. On the
whole, when given the choice
between The Tn Drum and any
other movie made in this country in
the ‘30s or ‘90s, I'would always
choose the American-made madcap
comedy. I feel safe, without having
to worry about “those darrm kids

Omniscient columnist dispels myths   and rumors

A lot of things in life change lit-
tle from what actually happened to
what you hear happened. Somehow,
some things sometimes have a‘ way
of embellishing themselves some-
where between what he said and
what you get.

Almost everyone’s played that
game where you and a group of peo-
ple line up, pass a message from the
first person in line all the way down
to the last and then compare the two
messages. Strange how quickly the
phrase “Mary had a little lamb” can
turn into “Something scary just
devoured a pigmy ham.”

Real life events just have a nifty
way of sounding incredibly more
entertaining when told by someone
who wasn’t even there —— or who
can spin the story in a way that
makes them look pretty. good. Don’t
they?

Take, for example, back in the
days before we had these nifty
word-processors and fancy-dancy
computers. I’m talking about the
days of my freshman year when I
still had to print each and every one
of my articles with individual ink
stamps of each letter before an issue
of The Pitt News came out.

Things were different back then.

I’m talking about back in the
days when nine—out-of-every-ten

zits.

Yes, I’m talking about the days
when we could, just listen to whatev-
er the media moguls wanted us to
hear, and believe it without even
thinking twice. (Except for that
whole ‘Dewey defeats Truman’
thing — which we later discovered
was a plot carefully conceived and
executed by the communists.)

In fact, with a little help from
people like Oliver Stone, I will be
successful at bringing the truth
behind some fallacies in the news to
light for you today.

(Just remember folks, you read
this all here first. And please don’t
worry about having to think for
yourselves: it’s all true.)

MYTH #1: Every news organi-
zation in this country has a political
agenda that it is trying to forward.

TRUTH: News organizations
are completely unbiased except for

thinking of the sponsors who adver-
tise with them whenthey report a
story because all their transmitting
equipment and salaries miraculously
pay for themselves.

To think that news organizations
are held accountable to whoever
holds the mighty dollar that gives
them life is blasphemous! That’s
never been the situation and it never
will be. _

MYTH #2: Television —— when
not watched in moderation — is bad
for you. ~

FACT: What!?! There is
absolutely no scientific evidence
that sitting next to a box that emits
quality programming is harmful.

What could we possibly have to
fear from the'so—ca1led “boob tube”
that keeps the average American a
prisoner in their ownhome for 4.22
hours per day, according to 1995
U.S. government statistics?
Nothing. There is just too much
important information to gather
from prime-time network television.

(And besides, it gets us out of
having to do annoying things like
read, spend time with our families
or prove that we really deserve to be
the dominant species on this planet.)

the American peo-

FACT:
Eleven-

times greater than them. It also
helps if they have a good enough
quarterback and sufficient media
coverage to make his comeback
against impossible odds seem
incredible —— but not incredible
enough for a majority of the nation
to bet on that team.

MYTH #4: People want to take
advantage of our collective thought.
Certain institutions want to manipu-
late the power of the, masses —
which inherently act as one big,
blundering, oafish body —— for the
one thing we do really well when we
fall prey to. not thinking for our-
selves: being destructive. -

silly. Who has ever heard of some-
one manipulating hundreds of thou-
sands of people into doing things

that would benefit only himself yet .

That’s just crazy.

Anti-frat activist

I am writing this letter in response
to Mr. Jon Kendall’s Jan. 26 letter to
the editor. I am the founder of the
Anti-Fraternal Council, and I am
responsible for the signs that were
placed throughout campus to combat
rush.

Mr. Kendall stated that he would

_ never slander an organization or hang

ﬂiers against them if he did not agree
with what they were doing. Well, that
is the problem with today’s society.
People complain about everything, but
they never speak out against them. I

He also stated that the negativity
of my ﬂiers seemed like a “low blow”
to the system._ That is exactly what
they were intended to be! There is a
certain amount of shock that is
involved with seeing a ﬂier that
speaks out against rush during the
events. g

This university does not have a
“Fratemity Defamation League.” We
are in no way affiliated with this uni-
versity; were totally independent. All
the ﬂiers were paid for with my own
money, and all the ﬂiers were hung by
me. .

I have never been a part of the

Greek system, nor do I have any inten-
tions of supporting it or any of its
agendas in any way, shape or form.
This is my third year here at the

been spending lots of time watching

the way Greeks act. I have noticed that .

the overwhelming majority like to
walk around with their noses in the air,
looking down on all independents and

Suer Suna:
frogs, ferrets

oh, and football

It’s been three days.

America has had a chance to recover
from its biggest sporting event of the year.

This year’s fare was a standard one:
Despite fan support and intense desire, the
favored team —— the big boys in green who
won last season — were again the victors.
Only this time, it was a close call.

That’s right. It’s ofﬁcial. The frogs beat
the lizards.

In the only television event where view-
ers plan bathroom breaks to coincide with
the program, not the commercials, the
Budweiser ﬁogs survived an assassination
attempt by a loony lizard and a fumbling fer-
ret by holding on to tree limbs for dear life to
avoid becoming the main cornse at Chez
So-and-So. ‘

By doing so, Budweiser can claim vic-
tory in Sunday’s biggest event ——Ad Bowl
X.

No joke. Business staffers at USA
Today, the reigning circulation king of
American newspapers, have done tests to
determinethebestandworstadsofthe
Super Bowl, ranking the national cornmer-
cials by analyzing the reactions of a volur1-
teer test audience. They’ve done this for a
decade.

How? Said staffers hook up devices to
monitor subtle physical reactions of the
viewers as each second of the ad unfolds.
Yes, each second.

On the one hand, that’s disturbing, and
inaccurate for crying out loud. Suppose one
of the subjects fell asleep during the Intel ad,
then slept through the Doritos ad with the
girl doing splits in the laundromat? The
standings could inevitably be skewed.
Could civilization continue?

On the other hand, each second equals
$46,000 worth of advertising, considering
the going rate for Super Bowl spots was
$1.4 million per half—minute.

Anyway, the ﬁnal rankings champi-
onship went to Pepsi, which scored big on
that skydiver—pouring-carbonated-beverage
down—the-duck’s-throat ad.

But Budweiser put four ads in the top
10. All four involved the green spokes—ani-
mals, ﬁem the original electrocution to the
not—too-surprising discovery of living frogs
to the lizard chewing out the ferret to the
apology (where the lizard made it clear that
he did not endorse such “amphibian—related
incidents”). ’

So there’s your champion.

And for once, rightfully, nobody gives a
fnog’s fenet (or, for that rrratter, a ferret’s
frog) about it

Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panther ﬁn-
ished their Big East road trip
last night.

Three stops. Three Big
East opponents. Three impor-
tant games for the women’s
hoops squad

Three losses.

The climax to this p1mish-
ing series of contests came in
New York, with a 66-56 loss to
the St. John’s Red Storm The
loss brings the Panthers’ record
down to 4-14, 1-10 in the con-
ference.

_Double-digit scorers in
T‘uesday’s contest included
Pitt’s Nickeia Morris and Gina
Montesano, who each pumped
in 10 points. However, they
were both outmatched by the
Red Storm leaders — Ebony
Dickenson, who put in 21
points, and freshman Latasha
Thompson, who scored 18
points oﬂ the bench.

Pitt’s leading bench scor-
er, backup forward Alecia
Balich, managed just eight
points in 18 minutes. The
Panthers’ leading scorer olf the

 

forward Kenosha Chastang,
scored only six points and
made just two ﬁeld goals all
night

Despite the lopsided indi-
vidual stats, the Panthers
played their hosts close in the
ﬁrst half—— both teams entered
the locker room at the halftime
buzzertiedat30.Inthesecond,
though, Pitt shot 35 percent
from the ﬁeld, hitting only
eight shots from the ﬂoor on
the way to the team’s sixth
straight loss. _

Morris and Montesano
were among the team’s worst
shooters, hitting four of nine
and ﬁve of nine from the ﬁeld,
respectively. Pitt guard
LaTonya Blanton started,
played 36 minutes in the con-
test andvdid not hit a shot from

‘the ﬁeld.‘ ‘Only sophomore

starterTamica Hunter was per-
fect from the ﬂoor, but saw
very limited action on the
night, scoring four points in
mne minutes. ~

Track iust misses national marks in doubleheader

Geoff Moak

column, page 10

Staff Writer

The pope went to Cuba, the AFC
won a Super Bowl, and the Pitt men’s
and women’s track teams "ran two
meets last week.

While it isn’t unusual for other
teams to have two games or matches in
three days, a track meet is usually an
all-day (sometimes two—day) affair.
Pitt’s two-meet weekend isn’t quite as
rare as pontiff visits or Broncos’ titles,
but it’s close.

The teams’ whirlwind eastern tour
took them to the Virginia Tech
Invitational on Friday and Saturday,
then to New Jersey for the Princeton
Relays on Sunday.

“We wanted to be on the road
together for four days,” Head Coach
Steve -Lewis said. “We got to know
each other real well.”

Going to twice as many meets
meant twice as many chances to per-

form — -something particularly impor-
tant for less-experienced athletes. As
usual, some‘ of them performed quite
well.

The Virginia Tech meet created a
unique opportunity for the Panthers
due to the high—quality facilities and
the competition. More than 30 schools
were represented — many from pow-
erhouse conferences like the Big East,
ACC, and SEC.

“I would say that 75 percent of the
top teams in the country were at that
meet,” Lewis said.

Lewis was hoping that the tough
competition would encourage his ath-
letes to perform at their peak and qual-
ify for the national championship
meet. His hopes would go unfulﬁlled,
even though there were several near-
misses.

All day long, the Panthers ran in
slower heats. The teams that ﬁnished
ahead of them were often running side
by side, while the Panthers had only

the clock to motivate them. The psy-
chological advantages of running in

' the faster heats may have been enough

to shave off the split seconds some of
the Panthers needed to qualify for
nationals.

One of Pitt’s most promising
squads, the men’s 4 x 400-meter relay
team, got stuck in the wrong heat.
Jeremy Ward, Tim Tyre, Sekou Dilday,
and Carl Taylor still ﬁnished in third

place overall with a time of 3:14 —

their fastest this season.

The national qualifying time for
the event is 3:12. That happens to be
the time achieved by the University of
Kentucky’s team, who ran in the fast
heat and won the event.

Lewis’ high opinion of the relay
team was reaffirmed by its perfor-
mance. _

“We feel we’re as good as anybody
in the country right now,” Lewis said.

In the men’s 800 meters, it hap-

Locking In: Sophomore guard Jarrett
Lockhart may ﬁnally be the tlnee-point

being in high school.

Through the team’s ﬁrst six games this
season, Lockhart made only ﬁve of 30 three-

Overall, he connected on just 15 of 49 shots

Pitt Panther hockey drops  
penalty-filled contest to WVU

Rachel Lenzie
Staff Wrlter

It really was a Backyard Brawl
for the Pitt hockey team Friday

night —— a game against West
Virginia amounting to nothing but
mayhem.

Over 110 minutes in penalties
were called by the referees, seven

players and coaches were ejected '

from the game and the melees
-resulted in three unanswered power
‘play goals for the Mountaineers en
route to their 8-2 win over the
_Panthers.

‘ Coincidental penalties on Pitt
‘forward Andy Mecs (slashing) and
.-West Virginia winger Ted
Kendziora (roughing) midway into

.;the second period set off a rash of
"penalties for both teams. Pitt’s Jake

Polochak and Jared Sullivan both
received fighting majors, while
assistant captain Mecs was thrown
out of the game for apparently leav-
-ing the penalty box during an alter-
cation.

Mecs had no comment on the

call or the altercations, but had high-

regards for the Mountaineers.
' “West Virginia has a strong
team. It was a good physical game,
they were tough and they are a well-
respected team,” said the sopho-
more forward. “They’ve only lost to
Penn State this year and playing
them was a good challenge for us.
The game was a good showing for
‘us, until the chaos occurred.”

Pitt Assistant Coach Wally
Scheide was also thrown out of the
game, along with Polocak, who was

involved in a fight.

“We need to worry moreabout
scoring goals than beating people
up,” Polochak said. “When you
can’t score you get frustrated.”

Dan Lenza and Mecs tallied
Pitt’s only goals, while forward
Dave Fryer had two assists for the
Panthers, whose record dropped to
1-12.

The Mountaineers peppered
goaltender Patrick Kenny with 56
shots, including 29 in the first peri-
od alone.

Pitt unexpectedly had Saturday
night off, as Slippery Rock never
showed up for the 10:15 face-off at
Neville Ice Arena.

“We’re not too happy with
Slippery Rock,” Mecs said. “We
were purnpedrfor the game, we
thought we would win, and they
didn’t show up. [The American
Collegiate Hockey Association] is
going to hear about it.”

Mecs, who is involved in the
scheduling of games for the hockey
team, said that Slippery Rock was
contacted almost a dozen times over
a two-week period between I an. 19
and 24 to verify the game, and
again from Sunday until today for
an explanation for their cancella-
tion.

I “I’m not sure why: they didn’t
show up,” he said. “We still haven’t
gotten a response from them, but
the league-will take action.”

The Panthers will take on the
Duquesne Dukes this Saturday
evening at Airport Arena in Moon
Township. Face-off time is 8:30

2:10. All of these athletes did qualify
for regional championship meets, but
‘Pitt’s goals were higher than that.

Still, Lewis wasn’t too disappoint-
ed. .
‘ “When you have the best people
from the SEC, the ACC, the Big East,

and you can score in the top 10, you’ve

The Panthers did bring home some
first-place ﬁnishes from Princeton.
Trecia Smith won the shot put with
_a throw of 46-1 1/2. At both meets,

Smith competed only in the shot put,
which is not her strongest event.

“She qualiﬁed for nationals in the .

long jump and triple jump, her first time
out this season. We’re just trying to
improve her shot put now,” Lewis said.

The men’s hurdle relay team of
Arantes Lewin, Jeremy Ward, Brian
Richard, and Jack Jeffreys continued
Pitt’s domination of that event, winning
in 29.6 seconds.

“I think we’ve won that event all
but one time that we went to that meet,”
Lewis said. .

Ieffreys also had a second place
performance individually in the 55
meter hurdles, with a time of 7.60 sec-
onds.

Pitt’s other win came from the
women’s 4 x 800-meter relay team of
Joetta Purter, Tamika Dorin, Shuana
McFadzean, and Chantee Earl, who
won their race in 9:O8.5, qualifying.-for

Thanks to a Denver performance that
harkened back to the AFC dominance of the
1970s, and thanks to the most competitive
Super Bowl since Scott Norwood missed a
last-second ﬁeld goal for the Bills in 1991,
discussion in America’s oﬂices the next day
revolved around the game.

Yes, the actual game. The ads were cool
and everything, but reaction was geared
more toward the Denver olfense than those
dancing Intel people.

John Elway lifted a 500-pound gorilla
oﬂ° the backs of every AFC team. Terrell
Davis proved to the planet that he deserves
to be mentioned with such great playoff I'l1Il-
ning backs as Marcus Allen, John Riggins

FROM PAGE 7

 

and Franco Harris.

The Denver offensive line scored a vic-
tory for the little guy (sure, they average 280
pounds per man, but that’s pretty little, rela-
tively), pushing Reggie White and 345-
pound load Gilbert Brown around
Qualcomm Stadium harder than NBC
pushed the one-hour “3rd Rock from the
Sun” that followed the postgame show.

Finally, there was a reason to watch the
end of the game, and it didn’t involve frogs,
dancing bears, Nissan trucks and dogs, mov-
ing beer bottles, ducks drinking soda or any-
thing else quite that foolish.

Both football die—hards and commer-
cial-watchers got to see media darling Brett
Favre ﬁnally fall ﬂat on the national stage.

sideline and watched his dream corrre true.
(For the obsessive Steeler fans, that would be
Elway, not Bronco backup Bubby Brister.)

guard prospect to distribute the ball to these
big men. Local product Archie Miller made
a verbal commitment to Pitt during his
jrmior year at Blackhawk High in Beaver
Falls, Pa. The next year, though, the 5-foot-

9 recruit retracted his commitment and '

decided to sign with North Carolina State,
where he currently starts as a freshman

“Ihe basketball situation in North
Carolina is great,” said Miller, after decid-

college ball. I wonder if a convocation cen-
