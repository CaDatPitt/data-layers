Selected at Town   Meeting

‘By GEORGE cnmrcos
University competition in the ex-
tempore speech contest on Pan-
American relations closed Monday
at a two-hour session of Pitt Town
meeting when six delegates for the
district contest were chosen.

Selected as delegates were Hol-
bert Carroll, C43; Harold Gondel-
man, C43; William Seyler, C42;
Harold B_ver, C42; Edward Bald-
ridge, BA41, and Edgar Beigel,
C42. First eliminations had begu
three weeks ago. —

Robert Carlson, first speaker on
the program, one of the longest of
Town meetings, declared that Hit-
lerism presented a deﬁnite threat
to the United States through Latin-
America. He maintained that while
we ’ﬁght Japan on the Eastern
front we are letting our back door
open to Europe.

Sey1cr’s subject was hemispheric
defense. He said the United States
needs more military bases in the
Carribean sea, and on the coast
line of South America. In this way
South America can materially help
us in this war.

To break down the divide between I

North and South'America, Carroll
recommended building a good sys-
tem of transportation and commu-
nication between the Americas. So-
lutions are to ﬁnish the Pan-Ameri-
can railway and highway, lower
steamship rates, and increase avia-
tion facilities.

Arthur Thompson’s idea for bet-‘

ter Pan-American relations was for
the North Americans to meet the
South American on ‘a culturally
even footing instead of our consid-
ering the Latins interiors when
they had a distinct culture cen-
turies before the Northerner-s.

Economic conditions were the
concern of Gondelman, who wanted
some clearing house in South
America where South American
currency could be‘ exchanged for
American dollars.

Baldridge, in talking on lan-
guage, said that although the en-
rollment in the University’s,, Span-
ish classes has increased 260 per
cent in the past two years, only
two classes in the United States
teach Portugese, the language of
Brazil.

Byer, with the aid of “Yogi J oe’.s”
crystal ball foresaw in the future,
if necessary, a self-sufficient West-
ern hemisphere, independent of the
rest of the world.

Subjects for the contest had been
drawn Monday morning after Bei-
gel had been chosen chairman by
lot.

Judges were Mrs. Zoe Thralls,
associate professor of geography;
M. A. DeVitis, associate professor
of modern languages; and William
Ford, instructor in English, substi-
tuting ; for. Dr. N. Andrew N.
clam.‘ professor. of histor V A

Uniformed Tri Deltsi Sell

Defense Stamps for Ilowal

When the Delta Delta Delta wom-
en take over the battleship booth
today, they will be aiming to break
the drive’s salg record of $248.25
established last Wednesday by the
regular salesmen of the defense
stamp committee. -

Faculty purchases are expected
to increase as a result of initial
efforts yesterday to induce faculty
participation-in this campus drive.
The booth will be open from the

second through the seventh hours,
and committee. salesmen will help
the Tri-Delts by selling stamps in
the elevator lobby and adding the
receipts to the sororit_v’s sales to-
tal at the end of the day.

Dressed in uniform costumes of
white blouse, black skirt, and red
sash, the 40 women salesmen will
initiate the women fraternities‘ par-
ticipation in the drive. V

Next week Delta Zelta will be
in charge of the battleship booth
and the other fraternities will fol-
low each week.

Committee members again stress-
ed that stamps can be redeemed
at any time for face value, and that
ﬁlled booklets may . be turned in
to the committee for a defense sav-
ings bond, redeemable for purchase
value, $18.75, after. six months, or
graduated upward to a total of $25

   
 
  
 

 

Construction on the battleship
Iowa, symbol of the campus drive,
is still proceeding, probably ahead
of schedule, but deﬁnite informa-
/tion is being withheld by the gov-
ernment for military reasons.

Pending receipt of government
assistance and of deﬁnite indication
of local success, the committee will
launch its nation-wide drive in a
few weeks.

This dance, the lirst to be held

Pitt‘ swininiing team, the only

athletic aggregation on campus
that lias‘ been winning with any
semblance of. regularity, goes. _a.i‘.'tel:
another Awinthis Saturday night
against Michigan State’s Spartans.
At present the Panthers are sport-
ing a five win and one loss mark.

In facing the Spartans the Blue
and Gold mermen will be up

against an outfit that thus far this

year have won two, lost three and
tied one meet. Despite this medi-
ocre record, ‘Panther "swimming
mentor, Ben Grady, fears the in-
vaders and is.not tool opti istic
about the§chances for another‘ Pitt
triumph. ?

Grady bases his gloomy outlook

on the fact that the Micl1iga'd'Stat-

,. ers have ‘a’ good‘, strong team that
-3‘-is well balanced and is loaded down

off with the meet, bec‘ausc they

rarely lose a second place. As Grady

put it, ,.“_They,have toomany second
“place men for us.” ‘

_ The visitors are led by co-cap-

tains, John Becker and Fred Still-
man. Standdut member of _ the
squad, however, is junior Fred
Newt‘on_,-  W.as3‘a sens;a3ti.:o»nv,dur-

  

eam

ing his freshman term. Other ace
performers on ‘the Spartan team
are:Charlie Bigelow, breast stroke
star and Fred Himmelein.
Notwithstanding the pessimism
of Grady, the Panthers should give
the visitors a good ﬁght before the
meet is concluded. Led by Gus
Wilde, Herb Cosgrove,. Al Samson,
Joe Orlofl’, Marty Kramer and Joe
Kaule, the Pittmen have been hav-
ing a top-notch season.
Orlofi’, K r a m e r , Wilde, and
Cosgrove form a first rate mile re-

«lay quartet and have ably ﬁlled the

trunks of the last great Pitt mile
relay foursome of Milt and Hy Led-
erstein, Al Beacon, and Al Sloboi
dian. ' 
. Gus Wilde, a junior, has reach-
ed his peak this year and has ful-
ﬁlled all the expectaﬁons of star-

dom that were predicted for him. ,

With another year to go after this
one, providing the draft doesn’E get
him, Wilde should be one of the_
tbp mermen of the district before
he lays his trunks aside.

Although Coach Grady seems to

comparison of Michigan State-’s

get the most from the money they
spend and how to best conserve
what they have.

Dr. Elwood Amos, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁnance, will teach this in
a new course which will be added
to the summer term beginning in
June.

. “Personal ﬁnance,” ‘said Dr.
Amos, describing his course, “is a

factual presentation of how the

consumer can best cope with the
problems of making a slowly in-
creasing income meet the demands
of rapidly increasing taxes and liv-
ing costs."

Without any prerequisites. the
course is not essentially a consumer
education program or a theory
course, but one in which buying on
credit, buying by installment, and
the‘ related problem of personal
borrowing are considered.

Special emphasis is placed upon
the advantages, disadvantages and
costs of buying on credit and by
installment. ‘
