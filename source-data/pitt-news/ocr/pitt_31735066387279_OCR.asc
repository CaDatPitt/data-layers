State bill says to publicize finances

By Steve Kozarovich
News Editor

Pitt and other state—related universities will
be required to make public basic financial
information, according to a bill passed by the

state legislature recently.

But the university will be allowed to keep
specific individual salaries private. The law
requires Pitt to release general budget informa-
tion, average salaries for different classes of
employers and purchases of goods and services

over $1,000. V

The bill passed

in the House of
Representatives by a vote of 189-7 and in the

Stairs, R-Mt. Pleasant, sponsored the bill.
A different bill proposed by Rep. Ronald

Cowell, D—Wilkins, was rejected in favor
of the Stairs bill. Cowell’s proposal would
have required Pitt and the other state—related
schools to disclose all financial information.

A bill similar to the Cowell bill was

approved by the House in 1991, but it didn’t
pass in the Senate.

In other business, the state legislature
approved next year’s fiscal appropriation for
Pitt, $139.84 million.

The bill contained two new line-items that

News Assistant

University of Pittsburgh
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor reprimanded the
president of the University
Senate for published com-
ments which denounced the
way Pitt has handled research
integrity cases.

In a letter sent out to facul-
ty members and‘ other admin-
istration on June 21,
O’Connor criticized James
Holland’s remarks which
appeared in the June 15 issue

of The Chronicle of Higher -

Education, claiming they had
shed “an unfair, unwarranted
and potentially damaging
image on this institution.”

In the letter, O’Connor
said Holland’s comments
concerning various research
integrity cases portray “the
administration’s conduct of
these cases as one of incom-
petence and failure.”

The Chronicle article ques-
tioned whether Pitt represen-

'tatives would be able to

investigate misconduct. alle-
gations surrounding the
breast cancer research project
and its director, Dr. Bernard
Fisher, objectively.

Referring to Pitt’s ability to
adequately investigate past
cases of research negligence,
Holland said in The
Chronicle of Higher
Education, “They seem to
always do it wrong. They’ve
had quite a bad track record.

Problems
conﬁnuet
at dental
school

By Steve Kozarovich
News Editor

“Serious f1aws”
occurred during the
recent planning and
budgeting reorganiza-
tion of Pitt’s School of
Dental Medicine,
according to a report
compiled by a Senate
Budget Policies sub-
committee.

The report on the
Planning and Budgeting
System in the dental
school during 1992-93
was started in
November 1993 in
response “to concerns”
raised by dental faculty
last fall, according to
the report.

In a prepared state-
ment dental school
Dean Jon Suzuki said,
“The School of Dental
Medicine applauds the
efforts of the PBC sub-
committee to evaluate
the reorganization
process.”

“The report describes
the school’s process as
being initiated under
one model and having
to adapt to another
model (PBS),” Suzuki
said. “While the initial
efforts under a new sys-
tem are not always
smooth, the Planning
and Budgeting System
is now established and

Coroner says no more brains For Piﬁ

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Acting Allegheny County
Coroner F. James Gregris has
suspended the practice of
sending brain tissue to the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, effective June
1, until county law experts
review the process.

Gregris called for the review
in response to concerns that
brain tissue was given to

8 UPMC without the consent of

next of kin, raising ethical
questions about the practice.

“I thought it was necessary
for this office and the universi-

. :4,

w,..’<.«

ty to have a legal opinion
regarding the legality of this
particular practice,” Gregris
told WTAE-TV last week.
Recently, five families sued
the Philadelphia Medical
Examiner’s office when it was
disclosed the office donated
brains from 26 corpses to the
University of Pennsylvania
Medical School without per-
mission of relatives. Penn
claims the practice is legal
because the organs had been
removed during autopsies.
According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, the coroner’s
office here has been providing
specimens to Dr. J. John Mann

and Dr. David Lewis,
researchers at UPMC, for at
least four years. They used the
tissue for a study of abnormal-
ities that could cause or con-
tribute to suicide, schizophre-
nia, depression and
Alzheimer’s disease. After
their evaluation, UPMC pro-
vides the coroner with the test
results.

Former County Coroner
Joshua Perper, who started the
practice, had previously
looked into the legal and ethi-
cal issues and felt comfortable
with the brain donation.

Perper told WTAE he started

Tokyo — The two largest polit-

break a stalemate that could
possibly lead to election of a

This recent incident makes it
less likely there will be a con-

Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata

would begin talks with North
Korea in Geneva July 8.

White House spokesperson

Other officials have said among
the U.S. list of issues the talks

Washington D.C.—— The U.S.
Supreme Court upheld a New
York appeals court ruling
Monday that struck down a sep-
arate school district created for
handicapped children of a
Hasidic Jewish group.

In a 6-3 vote, the justices
deemed the case unconstitution-
al, claiming it violated the sepa-

The state of New York and
the local board of education had
supported the school as a consti-

Fullerton, Cal. -— A race-dis-
crimination complaint has been
filed against California State
University by a student after his
professor swatted him on the
buttocks. The student, Keary
Johns, is asking for $1 million
in the complaint.

Johns went to his professor’s
office to withdraw from a
course. The professor, Julian
Foster, said he jokingly asked
Johns if he wanted to be treated
like an adult or “a dumb kid
who gets his bottom swatted.”
Johns lowered his pants and the
professor hit him once with a
ruler.

Foster said black fraternity
pledges are treated worse during
hazing. Johns, who is black,
called the remark racist. — The

the brain-tissue research because he thought it
would help learn about suicide. He also said
consent was unnecessary because Pitt’s results
helped him determine the cause of suspicious
deaths.

In related news, UPMC has revised its policy
to expand the number of organ donations it
receives. According to UPMC public affairs,
patients whose hearts stop while doctors are in
the process of determining if they are brain-
dead may still donate organs with their fami-
lies’ consent.

Under the original 1992 policy “Management
of Terminally Ill Patients Who May Become
Organ Donors After Death,” many people who
suffered brain death were unable to donate
organs, but according to medical ofﬁcials, it has
been determined that organ donation at this
time is reasonable as long as all medical deci-
sions are made in the best interest of the poten-
tial donor.

With the new policy, UPMC hopes to narrow
the gap which now exists between the number
of patients on waiting lists around the country
and the number of qualified donors.

rural education outreach and
$250,000 for the Graduate
School of Public Health.

“We’re pleased that we
receive the extra money and
two additional line items,”
Pitt’s Director of
Commonwealth Relations
Ann Dykstra told the
University Times.

However, Dykstra said the
university was not happy
with the governor’s tuition-

challenge grant program.
According to the program,
Pennsylvania’s four state-
related universities (Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln) and 14 state—owned
universities would be

rewarded when limiting
tuition increases to 4.5 per-
cent for full-time, in-state
students.

“The university has objec-
tions because it favors some
schools,” Dykstra said refer-

ring to Pitt getting a 3.4 per-
cent increase in its education
allocation and Penn State
receiving a 4.8 percent
increase.

If Pitt decides to participate
in the program they would
receive $200 for each full-
time, in-state student.

If they decide not to par-
ticipate the university would
lose the $200 per student but
they would be able to raise
tuition as much as it chooses.

visible ethical cases is that the
administration is always on the
side of money and power.”

Holland said yesterday the
article implies he is also refer-
ring to the university’s han-
dling of the National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project (NSABP). “I specifi-
cally said I did not want to
comment about NSABP. I hon-
estly and sincerely have no
opinion on that. I have nothing
to say about it at this time.”

According to the June 23
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette,
Ho1land’s remarks stem from
incidents in the past.

In 1987, Dr. Erdem Cantekin
was charged with exaggerating
the benefits of an antibiotic
used for treatment in inner-ear
disorders. Cantekin tried to
publish contradictory conclu-
sions, but was prevented by
Pitt and put on probation.

The following year, Stephen
Breuning, a former psychology
professor, admitted in court

_ ATEUITL SETRVIEE S710? ’’

that he had made false state-
ments on grant applications. A
panel investigated further and
found that the professor had
falsiﬁed research before com-
ing to Pitt. The university was
criticized for not looking soon-
er into Breuning’s research at
Pitt. Also mentioned was Dr.
Herbert Needleman, who had
been accused of scientific mis-
conduct surrounding lead-poi-
soning research. The federal
Office of Research Integrity
cleared Needleman of the
accusations, but university offi-
cials were slow to come to his
defense, according to Holland.

Explaining why the chancel-
lor may have sent out the letter,
Leon Haley, Pitt’s executive
director of public affairs, said
the chancellor was reacting to
something he felt strongly
about. “The letter, in my opin-
ion, explains the chancellor’s
concern about the views of that
particular faculty member.”

O’Connor could not be
reached for comment.

future.”

The report described the pro-
cedural flaws as “a major depar-
ture from the collegiality, open-
ness and accountability which
PBS seeks to encourage.”

The report is part of ongoing
concerns that were ﬁrst largely
addressed when Faculty
Assembly discussed an anony-
mous survey circulated through
the dental school and filled out
by 80 faculty out of ll3 full-
time faculty and 50 part—time
faculty at the Dec. 7 meeting.

Senate President James
Holland told Faculty Assembly
he had “serious problems” with
the survey’s validity because
there is no way to conﬁrm den-
tal faculty filled out the surveys.

But Holland said the surveys
he read were consistent with
criticisms of the school that had
been made to him personally,
according to the Dec. 9
University Times.

Under PBS bylaws, the com-
mittee is responsible for moni-
toring whether the PBS is being

adhered to by the university.

“A number of the unfortunate
actions are perhaps to be under-
stood as an effort to push
through on course, and a
timetable, on which the school
had already embarked,” Suzuki
told last week’s University
Times. ‘

A compilation of survey
responses showed 59 of 72
respondents “viewed Dr.
Suzuki’s administrative style as
totally or almost totally autocrat-
ic.” Forty of 56 replied that to a
great extent they feel that
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
and Dr. Thomas Detre, senior
Vice chancellor of health sci-
ences, support Suzuki’s admin-
istrative style.

Also, 49 of 65 said they felt
that “Detre directs Suzuki’s
actions.”

Sixty of 71 said that to a great
extent they “feel intimidated and
expect reprisals if [they] voice
[their] opinions for possible
improvements in the school that
do not reflect the administra-
tion’s desires."

Opinions

Record says plenty

It’s all about tradition.

As usual, Pitt has been tearing up Oakland and throwing up its
own office buildings (of which there are a shortage).

As usual, Pitt has been whining about commonwealth funding.

As usual, Pitt has been paying outlandish salaries to people
who do not even work here anymore. —

And as usual, Pitt has found itself in the middle of another
major scientific research misconduct investigation, its sixth in the
last 12 years.

The number was high enough to earn the attention of federal
officials.

Two weeks ago, Pitt was questioned by the U.S. House of
Representatives Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation
about the federally funded National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project.

Pitt was asked to investigate the mismanagement of falsified
data involving the project. However, there is skepticism, here at
Pitt and in Washington, on whether Pitt will properly conduct the
investigation.

In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education, Pitt
Professor James Holland raised a skeptical eyebrow.

“They seem to almost always do it wrong. They’ve had quite a
bad track record,’.’ he said. “The only common thing I can see as
to how the university has reacted to all of the most visible ethical
cases is that the administration is always on the side of money
and power.”

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor wrote a letter 'reprimanding
Holland for his comments.

He said, “  you portray the administration’s conduct of these
cases as one of incompetence and failure  more seriously, your
comments which suggest that in handling research integrity cases
the university’s administration is driven by pursuit of money and
power, without regard for the ethical considerations  “

O’Connor had a copy of the letter sent to approximately 2,000
university faculty members, according to Leon Haley, executive
director of public affairs.

Why?

If O’Connor felt he ne_eded to reprimand Holland, the letter
should have been kept amongst themselves. There was no need to
publicly reprimand Holland in front of all his colleagues for
expressing his opinion.

Pitt researchers probably list integrity high on, their goal sheets
when it comes to research.

O’Connor, however, would be naive to think Pitt students or
faculty believe researchers would not bend the rules if it meant
millions of dollars were to come their way.

The university should be making more headlines about the pos-
itive results of their research, rather than defending itself from a
scandal involving research at Pitt. ,

If O’Connor is worried about Pitt’s image being tarnished in
the research world, he should not.

The research misconduct record speaks for itself.

W should I care anyway?  

Once in a
while you
come across
some utterly
spectacular
rhetoric that
 persuades you,

 

  the savvy,
Columnist ‘90s, media-
Amy soaked reader,
Hajduk to adopt a cer-

tain attitude. If the authoris
sufficiently competent, she will
manage, through the use of effi-
cient prose and skillful mar1ipu—
lation of language, to change
your opinion. This, however, is
not that discourse. Lately I’m
just not too concerned with per-
suading others to adopt my
views. I’ve developed a certain
amount of ambivalence “
toward most news and

current

information sources. Hey, I
need to know when the next
blockbuster film is going to be
released just like the next guy.
What I don’t need are more
non—stories masquerading as
worthy pieces of news. I sup-
pose I find it troublesome that
the national news allots three or
four minutes for a story on the
possible extinction of black rhi-
nos in Africa when it could
instead devote that time to a
story on missing children in the
United States. But I sense that
I’m getting too serious here,
and that doesn’t jibe with my
ambivalence.

Although I somehow man-

unaware of it until last

Actually, I’m not sure if pieces of news,”

the word ambivalence

shade of meaning for

affect me directly or ﬁnancial-
ly?

Regarding the issue of gay
rights, all I can offer by way of
opinion on the matter is one big
yawn. Do whatever the hell you
want to sexually, just stop
telling us that you have the
right to do it and instead go do
It.

Since we're always in the
midst of some sports season,
the fact that a certain team
lacks sufficient fan support is
often talked about. This is
news? So what if the Pitt
Panthers have a sparse showing
at home games? The fans who
want to go will go. So many
problems are easily taken care
of when considered from the
perspectives that I
employ here.

Mention any front-
page headline and I
will offer the response
of “who cares?”
Perhaps you could

my present demeanor,
but I didn’t feel like checking
the dictionary. So now that I’ve
revealed my equivocal stance
on the state of our society, you
might be wondering why I’m
writing an opinion column.
Well, ‘because they let me.

All I was really concerned
with for awhile was procuring a
pair of Nike women’s Air
Icarus running shoes, size 7, in
white and slate with a purple
swoosh, which seem to be rarer
than hen’s teeth in these parts.
To relieve the suspense I’ve
managed to create regarding
my footwear, I finally found
them. ' If you're even thinking
of dismissing my perspective as
mere Generation X ignorance,
or worse, laziness, don’t do it.
It couldn’t be farther from that.
Well, okay, maybe it does lie
between ambivalence and igno-
rance, with some degree of lazi-
ness hanging around the
fringes. It also has a lot to do
with the media saturation we all
face everyday. Yes, I’m conve-
niently ignoring the fact that I
too am contributing, on a small
scale, to the permeation of
information in our society.

For clarity’s sake, I don’t

Wednesday, a full two days
after it happened, the O.J.
Simpson saga was, and still is,
on the lips, minds and televi-
sions of the nation. It’s interest-
ing to me that this particular
event almost pulled me out of
my equivocal mire. But then I
watched that tense, 90-minute
Los Angeles freeway chase last
Friday night and I began to
wonder if it wouldn’t be better
to retreat back into the state
where I go about my daily busi-
ness, unfettered from the intru-
sion of -the media. Liberated
from what news agencies deem
crucial knowledge, I can con-
centrate on more important
things. No, I’m not going to

provide examples of those

important things. Guess, imag-
ine, make them up, whatever.
President Clinton could be
dogged by Paula Jones’ sexual
harassment allegations for
months, and the whole issue
could become a distraction that
pulls him away from more
pressing domestic and foreign
problems. That doesn’t appear
to have happened to any great
extent yet. And furthermore,
who cares about the whole

Ordeal anyway? Does. any of it _

argue that I, and others
who share my attitude, lack
ambition, drive and old-fash-
ioned gumption. Who cares
what you think. I wouldn’t have
graduated with a BA if I lacked
ambition. My priorities are dif-
ferent.

You can’t say you don’t care
about the environment or ani-
mal rights when these same
issues are propagated again and
again to a public that seems to
consume them hungrily.

I’m pretty sure my outlook is
temporary (for I actually do
admire folks like Brokaw and
Sawyer), and like most things,
will change over time. I certain-
ly wasn’t this ambivalent when
I started college four years ago.
If things do occur ‘in cycles,
then in four or five years I
might be obsessing over inter-
est rates, the feminist agenda
and foreign policy. But for now,
I don’t feel compelled to spend
energy on the countless differ-
ent current events that allow
shows like “A Current Affair,”
and even the highbrow
“PrimeTime Live”, to succeed.
I'm not interested. But if you
are, good for you. I don’t care.

Go Fish

Directed by Rose Troche
Written by Rose Troche

and Guinevere Turner

With Guinevere Turner,

V.S. Brodie and T. Wendy
McMillan

It seems a small victory that
on the 25th anniversary of
Stonewall, Samuel Goldwyn
sees it fit to bring a film like
Go Fish, a hip, bold little
working-out of the seldom-
seen lesbian slice of life pic.

Basicalf ' a tight, revealing
tale of th slowly developing
romance netween young "hip-
ster lvlak’ usuiﬂevere Turner)
and the older, self—effacing _Ely
(V.S. Brodie)", Go Fish takes
us through the daily lives of a
small group of lesbians with a
deft, humorous touch.

The thrust of this film does
rely mostly on the seemingly
mundane prospect of getting
the two unlikely heroines
together, but Troche and
Turner use this simple proposi-
tion to explore the lives and
relations of the women
involved in this little circle of
friends. ,

There’s wise mother-hen
Kia (T. Wendy McMillan),
whose machinations result in

Max and E1y’s eventual
togetherness, and her beautiful
Hispanic lover Evy (Migdalia
Melendez), whose coming out
results in her Catholic mother
damning her to hell in one
scene. Home, work, friends,
love, sex and dating get inter-
twined in some of the most
complete lives you’ll see on a
big or little screen.

My question before I’d seen
this film was whether marginal
sexuality could be seen on
film defocused from being just
a threat to mainstream hetero-
monogamy but without com-
promising those very real poli-
ties. Could it move in another
direction than films like
Swoon, whose director, Tom
Kalin, just happens to be an
executive producer on this
project?

It looks like Troche and Co.
have done it. Go Fish is very
much queer cinema’s She’ s
Gotta Have It, and like Spike
Lee’s innovative low-budget
success, this is a fine, funny
portrait of individual sexual
politics that doesn’t get
bogged down. by the myriad
mire of hetero—hangups sur-
rounding and yet manages to
not ignore those troubles.

More than just a nice charac-

Go Fish ‘s real riot grrrls director Rosie Troche, V.S. Brodie, and Guinevere Turner.

ter study, Go Fish also
employs some technical inven-
tiveness using slick montage

and grainy, slo—mo B&W to tie _

together this slightly loose nar-
rative into a potent package.
It’s the nod to experimental
film forms that pushes this lit-
tle picture into another level. »
It’s hard to imagine that this

all started with weekend
shoots and after—work meet-
ings, formed by a mostly
found cast and crew culled
from the Chicago lesbian com-
munity and turned into a film
that’s really something out of
next-to-nothing. ‘So give credit
to a community whose largely
ignored filmic past is finally

coming of age on screen with
an attitude and actuality that’s
producing truly fresh cinema.
Hopefully the obvious will
become even more painfully
so, and we will see that this is
what happens when those who
live it make their own films.

Old Songs in a New Cafe
Robert James Waller
Warner Books, $16.95

For most of his life, Robert James Waller was a
business school dean for the University of Northern
Iowa. But after penning The Bridges of Madison
County, a story about lovers who realize they are
really soul mates, Waller became a well—known
writer. He even recorded an album of sappy love
songs to accompany the book appropriately titled
The Ballads of Madison County.

When Waller appeared on The Oprah Winfrey
Show I kept wondering who this guy really was.
Oprah praised him. I merely saw him as a small-
town, guitar—strumming romantic. His image was
interesting, but all I wanted to know was, “Could
he write?”

I walked into bookstores surrounded by the The
Bridges of Madison County with Robert James
Waller shrines of posters and life—size cutouts and
reviews that urged me to read to his book. So I did

'z.v.'o*.'~ln;"< mil xiii \¢‘a‘i\l‘l\‘s‘-‘Q5 J1 13: ‘nu; 

.41; "(U14 l'.vJ:.5.':U

 

and I was surprised to learn that Waller was much
more than just a romance writer and musician. I
realized he was a complete genius, but not in liter-
ary nature, however. With Bridges he spun a
romantic tale and put it to paper in only 14 days. It
remained the #1 bestseller for 32 weeks. Then he
did it again. Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend, Waller’s
second novel, hit the bestseller’s list immediately.
Robert James Waller had successfully marketed
and sold two ordinary romance novels.

Old Songs in a New Cafe is quite different. It is
not another romance novel. And it’s not another
album of Waller moaning about passion while
playing the guitar. I wouldn’t have read it or lis-
tened to it if it was. Instead, Old Songs in a New
Cafe is a collection of personal essays written dur-
ing the purest time of Waller’s career: at the begin-

“! C‘-A\\’.‘:."J."\j1\;|,.$.‘\) Ll Qahl \..7!'l'{".-IILI

ning. I was left wondering about Waller’s ability to
write because my opinions had changed. These
essays were good. Simple and poignant. He writes
about people and animals and about the days of his
youth and, of course, about romance.

One of the essays, “Romance,” is a commence-
ment speech given by Waller. Instead of lecturing
on what wonderful opportunities lie in the future.
Waller gives romance an importance that all. new
graduates should be aware of. He says it is “some—
thing that makes all the living and doing you are so
anxious to get on with worthwhile.” In “Slow
Waltz for Georgia Ann,” Waller’s wife blossoms
into an object of desire, like she first did, 25 years
ago. Waller writes about romance in a different
light here. Very unartificially.

Unfortunately, Waller should have evolved as a
writer through his essays, not his novels.
Regarding Old Songs in a New Cafe Waller says,
“We come, we do, we go, and I think we should not
take ourselves more seriously than that.” Finally.
The real Robert James Waller has spoken out.

a special treat in honour of America's inde-

band Impact Test. Including members of
mid-'80s industrial giants Boy Dirt Car,
Impact Test have been hard at work, beating
hell out of drills, steel girders and their fans
for at least the past 10 years. In 1985, Boy
Dirt Car gained instant validation by way of
Ann Landers' disapproval of their musical
ways. Following in the footsteps of Impact

Absurclly
low SAT

scores of
Prop. l 74

don't cut it

shuns criti-

cism and
throws the
hammer
down by
scrapping Proposition 48 in
favor of the tougher initial-eligi-
bility standards of Prop. 16.

But that was just a sham. The
NCAA is proving the thinness
of its skin by bowing to critics
and reviewing the Prop. 16 stan-
dards before its start date of
August 1995.

When the NCAA decided to
replace the current Prop. 48
standards, which require an
incoming athlete to have an
SAT score of at least 700 and a
core GPA of 2.00, it was admit-
ting that the standards were too
lenient.

Any kid who isn’t dedicated
to meeting those sub—standards
doesn’t deserve to play college
athletics anyway.

Prop. 16 still requires a mini-
mum 2.0 core GPA. But along
with that minimum an athlete
must score at least a 900 on the
SAT to be eligible. The higher
the incoming athlete’s core GPA
is, the lower his or her SAT ‘
score can be. But the minimum
SAT score an athlete must meet
is still 700.

The Prop. 16 standards are
tougher, which is what the
NCAA was trying to do. So
why then is the NCAA Special
Committee to Review Initial-
Eligibility Standards recom-
mending implementing
Proposition 174, which is
arguably more lenient than
Prop. 48.

Prop. 174 allows an athlete
eligibility even if they have an
absurdly low SAT score. ‘

Consider this: most initial-eli-
gibility casualties are kids who
fail to meet SAT requirements.

. GPA requirement is nearly

impossible, because of the way

Does anybody think that a

high school coach would sit
back and watch his or her prize
athlete miss a chance to partici-
pate in college athletics?

Where will he go?
Mobley could be micl-first round pick in the NBA

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

Anyone who saw Eric “E”
Mobley throw down a thunder-
ous dunk knew he had poten-
tial to one day become an
NBA player.

But how could someone
averaging a meager 13.7 points
a game last year and only 10.2
points in his career be project-
ed as a first round pick in
tonight’s National Basketball
Association draft?

“I really pushed my stock up
in Phoenix,” Mobley, a 6-foot-
ll-inch center said.

While Pitt’s second all—time
shot blocker with 184 was in
Phoenix strutting his stuff
among numerous NBA hope-
fuls, Mobley played with a
vengeance.

Averaging nearly 15 points,
10 rebounds, and setting a
record for shot blocks, “E”
was named to the Dessert
Classic all-toumament team.

“I was really focused at
Phoenix,” Mobley said. “They
picked six players out of 50 to
make the all-toumament team.
So I felt real good about that.
After that I was pretty much
set.”

It was not just his tourna-
ment play that excited the

NBA next year with the likes of Golden St. or New Jersey.

scouts; his intensity in the
weight room set him apart
from most prospects his size.

During a workout in front of
various scouts, he squatted
over 500 pounds, delighting
his onlookers.

“They thought that was real

unusual for a big man to be
able to do that,” Mobley said.
“But it wasn’t a big deal to me,
that was something I have
been doing all year.”
According to various draft
experts, Mobley is figured to
be picked anywhere from the

10th to the 20th overall pick.
Marty Blake, a scouting guru
of the NBA, has Mobley pro-
jected as the fifth center taken
tonight. Blake went as far as
saying that Mobley has more
potential than former George

NBA loﬂery shapes up like this:

By Jack Becker
and David Saliba
The Pitt News

The 20 underclassmen who declared them-

selves eligible will dominate the early portion
of the NBA draft, and for the first time since
1988 two Pitt players, Eric Mobley and Thomas
Hamilton, have a great chance to be selected in
the two rounds. ’
’ Notwithstanding any of the rumored trade
possibilities and the fact that underclassmen can
now return to school if they so choose, The Pitt
News takes a crack at the NBA’s lottery selec-
tions.

1. Milwaukee: The obvious choice is Glenn
Robinson of Purdue. The only question is
whether he will play in the NBA or take advan-
tage of the newly instated NCAA 30-day eligi-
bility rule. Our Prediction —- Robinson.

2. Dallas: This pick depends heavily on a
couple of different scenarios. Dallas needs a
point guard and a big guy down low. Jason
Kidd is the best point man in the draft and like-
ly is the choice here. Duke's Grant Hill is the
better player for Dallas but that would mean
trading Jimmy Jackson. Becker — Hill is the
best all-around player in a rich draft and Dallas
needs that kind of talent. Saliba — Kidd is no
Magic and never will be, but he fits in with the
Mavs' scheme.

3. Detroit: Donyell Marshall. He is the type
of player that the Pistons need. Quick, versatile
and hands big enough to scare Shaquille

O’Neal. They have lost a lot in the standings as
well as with the retirements of Isiah Thomas
and Bill Laimbeer. Our Prediction —
Marshall.

4. Minnesota: Providing Hill doesn’t go to
the Mavericks, there could be a Duke reunion in
Minnesota as Hill joins former mate Christian
Laettner. If Hill falls to the No. 4 spot the
Timberwolves get the franchise boost they so
desperately need. Look for Kidd to possibly slip
to Minnesota. Becker -— Kidd. Saliba —— Hill
is the finest player behind Robinson but will
have to wait until the fourth pick.

5. Washington: The Bullets will look to work
with the raw Yinka Dare. A 7—foot-1-inch frame
full of potential, Dare is a bit of a chance but the
Bullets could use someone who may possibly
bloom into an All-Star. Our Prediction —
Dare.

6. -Philadelphia: The Sixers have to find
some help up front for Shawn Bradley and
Clarence Weatherspoon. The biggest need in
Philly might actually be a guard, but with talk
of picking Michigan power forward Juwan
Howard, the Sixers could solidify one of the
best young front lines in the NBA. Our
Prediction — Howard

7. L.A.Clippers: Big Sharone Wright is the
needed man for the Clippers. The Clips may
lose Ron Harper and Dominique Wilkins to free
agency but they can’t pass up Big Sharone.
Saliba — Wright. Becker — L.A. can not pass
up a swing man in a draft loaded with two-

°Draft, page 13

Dare.

“Dare’s attention span isn’t
too high,” Blake said in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I
think Mobley is better.”

David Dupree, of USA
TODAY, has similar thoughts.

In yesterday’s article,
Dupree ranked Mobley as the
fourth best player in his posi-
tion going into the draft.
Dupree also stated Mobley’s
style resembles Felton Spencer
of the Utah Jazz.

This leaves the big question:
Where will he go?

Within the last couple of
months, Mobley has visited
Los Angeles, Golden State,

- Portland, Milwaukee, Chicago,

Dallas, Miami, Indiana,
Cleveland and Phoenix .

But when asked what team
he wants to draft him, the
Bronx, N.Y. native had thisito
say:

“Anybody really, who ever
wants me I’ll play,” Mobley
said. “It doesn’t make a differ-
ence.

“Golden State would be
good, but the only thing is Don
Nelson has a tendency of
telling people, ‘I really like
this person.’ But really in his
mind he likes somebody else.
[Nelson] did.the same thing
with Shawn Bradley and he
took Chris Webber. I think he
is planting a seed right now. I
don’t think I’m going there
and if I do it will be a big sur-

Lewis finds
new staff

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

Steve Lewis, head coach of
the men’s and women’s track
and field team at Pitt, wasted
little time acquiring his staff.

Lewis, who has recently
taken the reigns of the men's
track program, appointed
Candy Young, Mark Schwartz,
and Joanne Warner to com-
plete.-his staff.

Young and "Schwartz join
Lewis’ staff as full-time assis-
tant coaches while Warner will
serve as a graduate assistant
coach.

A member of the 1980
Olympics, Young, 32, broke

, the world indoor record in the

55-meter hurdles.
Schwartz, 45, has served as
an assistant track and field

V coach at Central Catholic High

in Pittsburgh (1973-74) as well

as at Fox Chapel High School
~ (1985-87). "

The youngest member of the
new coaching staff is Warner,
a 1994 Pitt graduate. A Big

cus and the javelin at this

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended by Section 513 of Public
Law 93-568, referred to as the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students," (more commonly called
the “Buckley Amendment“) requires that the University of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and
students of the following information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of students. In'order to do so,
these provisions are binding on the University:

- Individual student records include only information necessary and relevant to the educa-
tional purposes of the institution.

- Student records are open for inspection by students or parents of students under 18 years of

age upon request, with the exception that letters of recommendation written prior to January 1,
1975, remain conﬁdential. Additionally, speciﬁc documents that students have waived their right
to inspect remain conﬁdential.

- Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.

- The institution may not release student records outside the institution without student cons-

ent, unless one of several exceptions applies.

- Requests external to the institution for infomiation regarding students should be document-

ed, as should releases of student information.

0 The University may establish categories of information known as “Directory Information"
and release this information upon request by individuals external to the institution. This may be
done only after students are provided the opportunity to request exclusions from their infonnation
being released.

Directory information includes the following information:

Name

Address

Phone Number

Major Field of Study

Achievements, degrees, academic awards, or honors

Weight and height, if a member of athletic teams

Date and Place of Birth

Previous Educational Institution

Photograph

Participation in officially recognized activities and sports

Dates of Attendance

When the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System receives a student's refusal to permit

the release of “Directory Information", no further disclosures are made without that students writ-

ten consent. (Except to parties who have legal access to student records without written consent.)

The refusal to permit directory information is permanent. Rescinding of this action can be done by

the student submitting the request in writing to the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System.

Further information regarding the Buckley Amendment may be obtained in 738 William Pitt
Union. If you choose not to have any of the personal information included in Directory
Information released. complete and return this form to 738 William Pitt Union by 5:00 P.M.,

prise.”

The biggest surprise is that a
Panther has impressed the
NBA scouts. No Pitt player has
been drafted in the first round
since Charles Smith
(Philadelphia) and Jerome
Lane (Denver) in 1988.

“It feels weird mainly
because you see the past talent
that was here and out of all
those players, only two people
made it,” Mobley said. “That is
what really bothers me. I know
Bob [Martin] can play. I saw
Bob play a million times. I just
don’t understand how he didn’t
make it. Basically he and
Darelle [Porter] had a shot.
And there is no question in the
world if Brian [Shorter] would
have left his junior year he
would be in the league right
now.

“That is the sad thing about
it. But it feels good that at least
somebody else could come out
of this program with the adver-
sity we had.”

Pitt had a record of 13-
14 last season, but Mobley sees
this draft as “something posi-
tive” to come out of that year.
Yet, no matter where he is
selected, there is no doubt that
he will be taken somewhere in
the first round.

year’s conference outdoor
championship meet, Warner
holds the record in both events
at Pitt.

“The insertion of these three
individuals brings out not only
expertise to all of the compo-
nents of our program, but
excitement as well,” Lewis
said;

°From page 11

The sliding scale of Prop. 174
allows athletes to fall back on
their GPA while letting their
SAT slide. With a 3.0 core-GPA
an athlete would be eligible with
a SAT score of 410 or higher.

A 410? The lowest possible

score is a 400, and a student gets’

that for blackening in his name
in the little circles.

Now does anybody really
think that a 3.0 won’t come a bit
easier for college—bound athletes
if they, their coaches and their
teachers know that the kid needs
just a 410 SAT to go along with
it?

Why set out to make eligibili-
ty requirements stiffer and then
just end up making them easier?

The NCAA knows that the
real barrier between high school
athletes and college athletics is
the SAT. And now instead of
toughening guidelines with
Prop. 16 that would add some
weight to the laughable student-
athlete label, they are willing to
accept a 410 on the SAT with
Prop. 174.

Does the term dumb jock ring
a bell?

guards and small forwards.
Michigan’s Jalen Rose may
have to play a swing spot in
the pros instead of the point.
Rose goes to the Clips.

8. Sacramento: The Kings,
historically, are among the
worst draft practitioners, how-
ever, with Mitch Richmond
and Lionel Simmons they have
a good nucleus. Sacramento
lacks a low post threat and
North Carolina’s Eric
Montross fits the bill.
Montross’ stock has fallen in
the last year, but he has the tal-
ent to be selected higher than
eighth. Our Prediction —
Montross.

9. Boston: Larry Bird was
unable to help their lottery slot
and they will need more than
this pick to help them rebuild
their dynasty, but what they
need is a spark player. That is
Khalid Reeves. Saliba -
Reeves. Becker — Wright
might slip to No. 9 and rumor
is Boston loves him.

10. L.A. Lakers: The Lakers
need talent at almost every
position, but with hopes of
youngsters Doug Christie and
Anthony Peeler panning out at
guard the focus moves to the
front court. The unknown man

needed athleticism to the
power forward slot for L.A.
Our Prediction — Rogers.

will fit into their plans perfect-

ly. They need someone who
can shoot and help take the
pressure off the easily rattled
Gary Payton. Saliba
