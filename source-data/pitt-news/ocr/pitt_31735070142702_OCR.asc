‘ORGANIZED CHAOS’

Confusion loomed over more than 100 people who faced preliminary hearings yesterday for their charges during the week of the G—2O

Lindsay" Carroll
Assistant News Editor

erhaps a member of secu-

rity staff at city court de-

scribed yesterday’s G-20
arrest hearings best: “This is
crazy as hell.”

Hundreds of police officers,
lawyers and defendants —— many
of whom were Pittstudents —
came to Pittsburgh Municipal
Court to find what some lawyers
called “organized chaos.” ,

“No one knows what’s going
on,” attorney Sean Logue said.

By 8 a.m., around 100 people
had lined up outside the court
entrance to go through the metal
detectors. Inside, a day of confu-
sion, contradiction and emotion
awaited. ‘ ‘

   

The district attorney’s office
had set up a plea—bargaining
table to make offers to some de-
fendants.

The prosecution color-coded
defendants’ ﬁles to designate
which deals they..were eligible
to receive. Those with green or
yellow stickers were offered re-
ductions from misdemeanor to
summary offenses or postpone-
ments for 50 hours of community
service, which will be proved at
a later date.

City police Lieutenant Ed Trapp testified in court that the National Security event ended at 6:30 pm. Friday, when
President Barack Obama left the city. Arrests in Oakland began around 11 p.m. that day.

Documents’ for people arrested "Friday state that ofﬁcers told people to disperse at 10:29 p.m., but Trapp testified
in court and a city police press release said the order to disperse was given at 10:42 p.m.

crowdedthe second ﬂoor of the

tences, making deals and trying
to ﬁgure out where to be and at
what time.

At one point, the din of the
crowd got to be too much.

“You need to be quiet,” a deep-
voiced ofﬁcer shouted from be-
hindvthe district attorney’s table,

commanding nearly instant at-
tention. “We need to ‘get this
taken care of.” S .

In the terms of the deal, "people

“It was based on what they
were charged with,” Manko said
of the offer. “It was made clear to
them this morning_and they were
given the option of what to do.”

Manko said it didn’t matter A
whether specifics of the arrest,

were given in the criminal com-
plaint.

Before the hearings began,
Magisterial District judge Kevin
Cooper commanded silence in
the courtroom. People awaiting
their hearing were whispering
with lawyers and one another asa
few cell phones rang.

Cooper stopped one of the
cases, unrelated to the G-20, to
give a warning to remain quiet.

“There will be absolutely no
talking in this court room. There
are too many important cases to-
day for there to be talking,” he
said.

He asked those who came into
the room late to swear themselves
in. _

“Your right hand. Not your left
hand. Your right hand.”

i Hearings were held in three
separate courtrooms. Plea bar-
gains were officially made in one
small 21-seat arraignment room,
where defend-ants and their attor-
neys accepted community service
or asked for their hearings to be
postponed.

night. They were further orga-
nized into three groups according
to whom their arresting officers

ficers gave testimony about their

called an “overarching” testi-
mony for the prosecution on

said. _

At some points, what Trapp
said in his testimony conﬂicted
with testimony of other police of-
ﬁcers, as well as with the criminal
complaints.

Trapp said he helped plan the
G-20 police action for two months
prior to the event. He said that
there was no planned Pittsburgh
police action for Friday night,
since the national security event
declared by the Secret Service
was in effect until President Ba-
rack Obama left town, at about
6:30 p.m. Friday.

“That was the end of the
G-20,” Trapp said.

He said officers assembled at
the scene because of a fiyer ad-
vertising a “F*** the Police Push
Back Bash” rally.

Some protesters at the Peo-
ple’s March, which had run from
Oakland to Downtown that Friday
afternoon, distributed ﬂyers say-
ing that people would gather in

Schenley Plaza to protest police
action from the previous night,
Sept. 24. ‘

Trapp said he arrived at the
plaza around 9:10 p.m. Friday.
He said around 100 to 150 people

still there was no interaction on
the part of police. He said Chief
of police Nate Harper and Deputy
Chief Paul Donaldson gave the
order not to clear the Plaza until
the park closed at 11 p.m.

protest was peaceful, the officers
didn’t intend to take action.

“We never wanted to arrest‘

people,” Trapp said.
Some people in the room au-
dibly scoffed, and Cooper threat-

were there, and police lined up

along the east, south and west
sides of the Plaza, leaving the
northern end nearest to the Ca-
thedral open. Trapp referred to
a large print-out of a Google map
of the area.

He said that the crowd seemed
to become “more belligerent,” but

Trapp told officers to let peo-
ple out on the southern end of
the Plaza, toward the Frick Fine
Arts Building, so business dis-
tricts that had been damaged the
previous night on Forbes Avenue
and Craig Street wouldn’t be dam-
aged again. '

He said that as long as the

room. There wasn’t anything
funny being said up at the bench,
he said.

Trapp said the police received
intelligence that people might
come from behind the southern

end of the Plaza and try to attack 2

the police line.

“We never made it to 11
o’clock,” he said. More and more
people came to the plaza —— per-
haps 200 to 300 -—— and he said
he saw bottles being thrown
within the crowd. He couldn’t say
whether they were being thrown
at police.

Trapp said at this point, those
in command moved more officers
in back-up lines, some with riot

- gear. By 10:11 p.m., the corner

near the side of Hillman Library
was still open. Police received a
report from state police in heli-
copters that around 30 protesters
in masks began to move into the
Plaza, and Trapp said protesters
threw more objects.

Police requested that the
SWAT team bring the" Long Range
Acoustic Device, a machine ca-
pable of emitting loud messages
or s'ounds to‘ quell someone.

ner of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow

G-20 hearings 1 4

Pitt Union, and one at Schenley
Drive, near the Frick Fine Arts
Building.

Trapp said twice that the first
order to disperse was given at
10:42 p.m. The orders were giv-
en nearly back-to-back, he said,
and at 10:48, four more warnings
were given.

The Pitt News recorded the
first order to disperse at 10:42
p.m. It reported that police gave
the order a total of nine times,
with the last at 10:58 p.m., two
minutes before the Plaza closed.
A city police news release also
said the ﬁrst order to disperse
was given at 10:42 p.m.

Trapp said during this time, “a
number of people” went out the
northeast corner of the Plaza, and
some left through the south end,
as police originally intended. He
said police “didn’t really respond
at all” and let people leave.

At 10:53, he said police re-
ceived reports from supervi-

sors that people were throwing
things at the police lines, so po-
lice moved to push the rest of the
people out of the Plaza.

“By then, the crowd was fairly
small,” Trapp said. -

Another line of police officers
was stationed in front of the Car-
negie buildings to protect them,
he said.

He estimated that about 100
people assembled on Forbes Av-
enue across from the Cathedral

“Lawn. He ‘said the group of people
_stopped and turned to face the

police at the museums, but didn’t.

try to walk away. Trapp said Don-
aldson gave an order to push the
crowd out, toward Heinz Chapel
and the Cathedral.

At 11:07 p.m., Donaldson
told Trapp to begin arrests if
the crowd didn’t disperse, Trapp
said. Arrests began to be made at
11:11 p.m.

He said police moved the
LRAD into Forbes Avenue and

broadcast the warnings as the
crowd went along — although
this conﬂicts with the time The
Pitt News reported the broad-
casts ended.

An LRAD operator who testi-
fied later said that at its lowest

can be heard from a quarter-

Later, Trapp said he ended up

from that area on Fifth Avenue,
near the,Graduate School of Pub-

received an order for “tactical

Several of the defendants’
lawyers asked to cross-examine
Trapp after prosecutor Melada

lack of expertise on the subject,

Cooper continued to ask the dis-

Trapp said the crowd could have

example.

' resting officer who testified later, said he

was part of a group of.police officers who
moved onto Belleﬁeld Avenue toward the

Several lawyers tried to point out this ,

inconsistency.
One lawyer asked Trapp if people could

“Absolutely,” Trapp said.
Lawyer Mike Healy later pointed out
that the Cathedral Lawn seemed to have

been deemed a “point of egress.” Yet many -

Officer: They Could go anywhere

Pitt law professorjennifer Sadler said it
can be common for testimonies to conﬂict
within court.

“Nothing is exact in any criminal case,”
she said. ‘

Pitt law professor John Burkoff said
defendants could raise this issue with the
ofﬁcer in the future and try to impeach
his testimony. '

“But the truth is that different people
who were onlookers atla crime scene or
accident scene will often say different
things,” he said.

He said even when testimonies between
separate hearings conﬂict, it doesn’t mean
their testimonies are tainted. But the at-
torneys can use the conﬂicting testimo-
nies in trial.

Sadler said she understood why people
might have felt the situation with city
court was chaotic.

“City court is pretty crazy, anyway,” she
said. “It happens fast, too. That doesn’t
add to the understanding of the situa-
tion, I think.” ‘

. Procedures began at 8 a.m. at city court
yesterday and lasted until around 5 p.m.

About 75 more people have preliminary

hearings scheduled for Friday.

Debate showcases

mayoral malaise

Mayoral debates are not like their
presidential counterparts. Instead of

a crowded auditorium, candidates -

speak to an austere room, empty save
for a handful of local news reporters.
Mundane topics like neighborhood
restorationtake the place of war and
global epidemics.

Despite these shortcomings in en-
tertainment value, mayors generally

I affect the lives of citizens more than

the presidents.'On Wednesday night,
the three candidates for mayor ofPitts-
burgh debated issues facing the city. »
They met the low expectations set
for local politics — incoherent state-
ments littered with political euphe-
mism and genera1ization—but some
issues guaranteed to affect students
were hidden amid their rhetoric.
Kevin Acklin, one of the two Inde-
pendent candidates, provided ideas
mostinlinewith the needs of students.
He also made some major allegations

‘against Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, the

Democratic incumbent.
Acklin said it was “offensive” that
Ravenstahl proposed to levy a $50

A tax on all college students, among

other new taxes. To ﬁnd the $15 million
needed to close a budget gap, Acklin

Ravenstahl said, “We need $15

the student tax by saying that the city
already provides a lot of services to
students. His viewpoint is that the
city needs to spread the tax burden
and students are one of the beasts to
carry it. _

Ravenstahl claimed that the city

Unfortunately, the latter was the
case for Independent candidate Franco

Ravenstahl’s tax proposal, aswell. Har-

He also fervently talked about

Give Medal of Honor Where due

Sgt. Rafael Peralta dove on a grenade but has been unfairly denied the Medal

 
   

Mason Herron
Columnist

So far, there have been four
Medals of Honor awarded to
American soldiers ﬁghting in-Iraq.
The ﬁfth is long overdue.

Sgt. Rafael Peralta was born in
Mexico City, Mexico, in 1979. He
immigrated to the United States
and attended Morse High School
in San Diego. He enlisted in the
US: Marines the same day that he
obtained his green card. He would
become an American citizen while
serving and would eventually die
defending his adopted country.

The walls of his bedroom were
not covered with prurient post-
ers and other youthful things that
men his age typically displayed. In-
stead, there hung just three items:
a copy of the U.S. Constitution, the
Bill of Rights and his boot camp
graduation certiﬁcate. In the ﬁnal
letter sent to his younger brother
Ricardo, Peralta wrote, “Be proud
of being an American. Our father
came to this country, became a citi-

zen because it was the right place
for our family to be,” according to
the book “Home of the Brave.”
On the morning of Nov. 15,
2004, Peralta and his fellow Ma-
rines awoke in the city of Fallujah
—a terrifying labyrinth of alley-

Peralta was a platoon scout,

. which gave him the opportunity to

avoid direct exposure to front—line
assaults. As a soldier who always
looked for’ ways to help out other
Marines, he volunteered to join a
patrol. That day, Peralta and his

ways and corridors full of armed
and trained insurgents. The city
contained countless munitions, ar-
tillery, anti-armor devices and im-
provised explosive devices (IEDs).
The tactics used by the insurgents
had been unexpected and frighten-
ing. The Battle of Fallujah would be
hell, but every marine knew it had
to be fought.

comrades approached a house that
likely contained insurgent foes.
Immediately after Peralta kicked
in a door, he was shot — at point-
blank range — in the upper body
and face. As he fell, he made sure
to fall out of the way of his fellow
Marines so that they could con-
tinue to ﬁght.

While Peralta lay on the ground,

mortally wounded, “a yellow, for-
eign-made, oval-shaped grenade
bounced into the room” and land-
ed near his body, according to an
account in Stars and Stripes. With
his ﬁnal act, Peralta grabbed the
grenade, cradled it into his body
and awaited its fatal detonation.
Peralta showed courage, heroism,
sacriﬁce and a blatant disregard
for his own well-being. He also
saved lives.

“He saved half my ﬁre team,”
Cpl. Brannon Dyer said, according
to the Moderate Voice. Lance Cpl.
T.J. Kaemmerer recalled the eve-
ning after Peralta’s heroic death.
“Cpl. Richard A. Mason, an infan-
tryman with Headquarters Platoon
told me, ‘You’re still here, don’t
forget that. Tell your kids, your
grandkids, what Sgt. Peralta did
for you and the other Marines to-
day,”’ he said.

As he should have been, Peralta
was nominated for the Medal of
Honor, the highest military dec-
oration a member of the armed
forces can receive and one given to
those who distinguish themselves
“conspicuously by gallantry and
intrepidity at the risk of his life

above and beyond the call of duty .

while engaged in an action against
an enemy of the United States.”
Peralta did just that, but he has not
been awarded the medal.

A panel convened by Secretary
of Defense Robert Gates deter-
mined that, because of the serious-
ness of Peralta’s head wounds, he
couldn’t have been able to consci-
entiously and intentionally reach
for the grenade. His fellow Ma-
rines disagree and are outraged.
“It wasn’t just something he barely

did. He physically reached out and
pulled it into his body,” Lance Cpl.
Robert Reynolds said. Lt. Gen.
Richard F. Natonski said, “Sgt.
Peralta made a conscious, heroic
decision to cover the grenade and
minimize the effects he knew it
would have on the rest of his Ma-
rine team.”

In a letter to President Barack
Obama, U.S. Rep. DuncanHunter,
R-San Diego, aveteran of the cam-
paigns in Iraq and Afghanistan,
wrote, “The decision contradicts
the eyewitness accounts of those
Marines that were ﬁghting along-
side Sgt. Peralta and witnessed his
heroic actions. These accounts
should take precedence,” accord-
ing to the North County Times.

- For his courage, Peralta was
rightly awarded the Navy Cross.
His citation reads: “By his un-
daunted courage, intrepid ﬁghting
spirit and unwavering devotion to
duty, Sgt. Peralta reﬂected great
credit upon himself and upheld the
highest traditions of the Marine
Corps and the United States Naval
Service.”

It’s time that the Department of
Defense reconsider its prior deci-
sion and initiate a more appropri-
ate deliberation of whether Peralta
deserves the Medal of Honor.

Peralta’s younger sister, just a
teenager, is concerned about her
brother’s legacy. “I know that right
now, people are really nice and ev-
erything,” she said, “But I know
that when it comes to later on, they
are going to forget him.”

We should not. We cannot. We
won’t.

Tolkien characters live in Oakland

Why Pitt resembles Micldle—ea.r_th and you should respect your elders

 
   

Jacob Brown
Columnist

Pittsburghers are modern-day
Hobbits.

Like their Middle—earth-in-
habiting relatives, they’re set in
tradition, whether it’s praying
to the gods of Black and Gold,
speaking in strange yinzer
tongues or worshipping football
messiahs.

And just like Hobbits, many
Pittsburghers never leave their
Shire. 4 '

So when a bunch of us Orcs
from out of town set up shop for
school here, being obnoxiously
loud on weekends, it’s easy to see
why we don’t quite ﬁt in. Espe-
cially-with the elder Hobbits.

Just a few weeks ago, when I
was sitting onmy friends’ front
porch, an older man came by to
rant about the litter strewn all
over the sidewalk a few houses
down. Demanding we redd up the
red cups, he came off as rather
abrasive and senile.

I should have just ignored h_im,
but, like when a gumband snaps
back on my ﬁnger, I became a bit
jagged off. So I took the bait and
backtalked. '

That’s when Irealized that
even if this nebby-nose had been
a little off-base with his misdi-

. rected anger and foul mouth, I

was in the wrong.

Many of the older folk in Oak- i

land have probably been here lon-
ger than most students have been
alive, and they wouldn’t have it
any other way. They’re the sort
of people who’d consider it sac-
rilege to put non-Heinz ketchup
on food. I’d call them stubborn,
but the word wouldn’t do them

ldltorlnlltolidcl

justice.

To them, being a Pittsburgher
isn’t a matter of citizenship. It’s
more like areligion. That would
make us Orc-students the em-
bodiment. of '-the Antichrist.

. Pitt emerged as something
more than a gloriﬁed football
school in the; mid-1990s, "and.

more young bloodstarted making ‘

its way to the neighborhoods.
Just like that, many older
Oakland residents migrated out
of the area, leaving a lonely few

l Chris Crisci is the musical equiva-
lent of Superman.

He spent his ‘youth in Kansas,
playing the trumpet and trombone in
music programs. When a punk rock
band played athis school duringlunch
period, however, Crisci’s life forever
changed.

He bought a guitar, he played in
bands, and a new rock musician was
born.

He now plays for The Appleseed
Cast, and in a time of music peril, he
united the elite of the Kansas music

scene into one musical super group. i

Collaboration worked for The
Justice League, and it works for Old
Canes. Old Canes became The Apple-
seed Cast’s folk—rock alter-ego after a_
show on its European tour.

“We were booked kind of against
ourwill to perform an acoustic show,”
Crisci said. ‘_‘We told the bookingagent
that we don’t do that, but he booked

it anyway.”

Instead of moving in a new direc-
tion with the band, stylistically, Crisci
chose to do something different.

“I like Appleseed,” he said. “I liked
what we were doing. I didn’t want to
stop doing that.” .

The Appleseed Cast, Crisci’s pri-
maryband, tends to lean toward the
plugged—in side of rock. i

“We can’treallyperformAppleseed
Cast songs acoustic,” he said. “It just
doesn’ttranslate well. So, I just decided
to play some folk songs.”

That show was the beginning of
something important for Crisci.

‘Appleseedhas always beenaband
where we like to have alot of contribu-
tors,” he said. “Doingthis kind of folk
was really just somethingl was doing
on my own. I just played these songs
for myself or for friends once in a
while, just for fun, really just playing
around with them. It wouldn’t have
been somethingl would have thought
of performing.”

After playingthe songs solo, Crisci

. decided to develop the new sound.
“Thatwas theﬁrsttimelhadplayed V

these songsforanybody,” he said. “The
response was really good and a couple
of the guys encouraged me to record
it.” -

Eight members from other local
bands came together to form Old

om Canesamusical Supergro up

bands like The Appleseed Cast and The Minus Story, Old Canes delivers in the folk—music scene

Canes.

Old Canes recently released its sec-
ond album, Feral Harmonic, and will
perform in Pittsburgh as a ﬁve-piece.

“Especially at the beginning 4-
both records —- I’ve had seven or
eight different people playing on it,”
he said. “When we played as a tl1ree—
piece, two of those could have been
any of the eight people.”

Other members have their own
bands, including The Minus Story
and Crisci’s own, The Appleseed Cast.
He describes Old Canes as more of a
“musical collective.”

“Itwasn’treallyaband,” he said. “In
fact, still, the people we have are only
semi—comn1itted to the band.”

Although the collective formed a
few years ago, it has yet to reach the
same level of recognition as some of
their other bands.

“We haven’t really been out there
a whole lot,” Crisci said. “We released
Early Morning Hymns ﬁve years ago
but really didn’t do anything on it. So,
we have yet to go out and really kind of
garner any kind of a fan base at all.”

The fans of Old Canes aren’t just old
fans of the well-l<nown bands.

“I think that we have some fans
from Appleseed Cast,” he said, “Andwe
deﬁnitely have some people that come
to shows. They don’t even like Apple-
seed Cast, but they love Old Canes.”

By looking back at the Holocaust,
Stephen Mills, the artistic director of
Ballet Austin, hopes that people will
“apply it  and draw something out

The goal of the project is to educate
people aboutthis historic period, dur-

to apply the lessons learned from it
to issues that are relevant in today’s

rVibe cool technology
Without viable market

Kelsey Shea

 

Tons of on-the-verge bands invading the
stages of New York City’s most famous ven-
ues sounds like a festival worth checking
out.

rVibe agrees.

So the online social music community is
giving people across the country the chance
to check out College MusicJourna1’s annual
music marathon in New York City through
live streaming this year.

A nice use of technology it mightbe, but
in the end, no computer screen is ever going
to capture the actual experience of being at a
live show, despite how hard rVibe’s ads will
try to convince you otherwise.

A live chat feature doesn’t come close to

Asst. A8-E Editor ’

thinks that online streaming comes any-
where close to the awesome experience of
live music.

But what annoys me the most is that they
are trying to charge for it.

Do they seriously think I’m going to buy
a digital ticket for $25 to watch an online
video? If they’re marketing this toward col-
lege students, they can’t possibly know their
demographic. - .

like the taste. We’re poor and obviously will-
ing to sacriﬁce quality to save a few bucks.

So as far as catching clips and video foot-

age of the CMJ Music Marathon on the Web .

goes, all signs point to YouTube.

I think if rVibe wasn’t trying to charge
people for music, something our genera-
tion is pretty adamantly against, streaming
the festival to the masses would be a pretty

cool idea. V
It gives the bands even more exposure,

video streaming, regardless of its quality,
isn’t going to be the same as seeing the sweat

And there is no way my MacBook could ever

than I am could.

Honestly, the whole thing vaguely an-

I understand that it’s cool that people

Additionally, CM] is aﬁve-day festival

spanning from Wednesday Oct. 21 to Sunday I

Oct. 25 — a whole weekend.

For now I guess —we’ll have to sit back and
leave the real fun to NYU students, while
we keep up our pipe dream that maybe Pitt

canes brings energy, dance

Folk band hopes to present most complete sound

Atlive shows, the folkfms still like to moveas
much as the rock fans do.

“I love the energy,” Crisci said. “I love that
when we play the people that come out to the
shows arewillingto dance, they’rewillingto really
show that they’re into it.” '

Crisci and Old Canes tryto presentasoundas
complete as possible, even when touringwithout
all the band members.

“Whenwe went outas the three-piece before,
we took the most essential part and we played
it,” he said. “But this time, we’re trying to cap-
ture everything, down to the shaker. [Concert-

goers] will see a good representation of what we
recorded.” »

Superman always found a few friends at The
Daily Planet, and Lawrences music scene fosters
the same sense ofbelonging—— somethingthat led
to Crisci meeting somevery super friends.

“Speciﬁcally Lawrence, Kansas — Kansas
as a whole, I wouldn’t say is very artistic — but
Lawrence is a college town, there’s tons of great
bands,” Crisci said. “It’s a really good commu-
nity.” . g ; -

Snow Patrol
swerves into

new territory

Azia Squire
Staﬂ” Writer

Album: Late Night Tales‘
Artist: Snow Patrol

Record Label: Azuli Records
Rocks like: Tiesto

"PN 1' de

    

When you think of Snow Patrol, you mostly
think of soft ballads and poetic exclamations of
love, but you never really consider it for your
Friday-night iTunes playlist. Now you will.

Late Night Tales has the members of Snow
Patrol trying their hands at D]—ing, and they
happen to do a fantastic job. An electronica-
style mix album featuring a wide range of art-
ists, Late Night Tales is erratic, melodic and
unforgettable. “Midnight with a Tribe Called
Quest” is the most laid—backtrack on the compi-
lation —— withaminimalist beat and slick lyrical
delivery, it’s the perfect head-bopping song.

_ “Hold On” is allthump. ‘.‘Holy Ghost!” belts
out the chorus (“Hold on! And hold tight!”)
over a shadowy piano loop. Upon ﬁrst listen,
it’s evident-that if dance itselfwas a song, it
would sound like this.

The only moments where Late Night Tales
falls short is where it attempts to slow down.
Though not cohesive in the class sense, most
of the tracks seem to blend seamlessly into one

another — or they would if certain mishaps _

had been left off the ﬁnal cut.

Oddly enough, Snow Patrol’s INXS cover,
“New Sensation,” is one of them, and Miracle
Fortress’s “Next Train” is the other. Though
solid tracks on their own, they sound awkward
on such a high—energy compilation.

Snow Patrol always made great music, but
with this album, it proved it’s capable of making
excellent music. Even if it has to exchange epic
ballads for club mixes again on its next effort,
here’s to hoping it continues in this direction.

Band: The Rooftop Trio
Sounds Like: The Avett Brothers,
Ella Meno

Why do we love Pittsburgh? Is it the $5 pizzas
or the fact that the city constantly pumps out
new artists like The Rooftop Trio? Personally,
I’rn leaning toward the latter.

As the newband in town, The Rooﬁop Trio ad-

vertises its recordings as “Blues. Funk. Rock.”

It’s deﬁnitely not guilty of false advertising,
and it really knows how to put together a nifty
little piece of fun.

The band relies more on its musicthanlyrics,

Local band ‘nifty little piece of fun’ 

with instrumental solos lasting for about half of
each song, creating a nice sound that is sure to
relax listeners. _ '

Its pieces are fun to listen to because of how
pleasing the ﬁnal product is to the ears.

The drumming is smooth and makes easy
transitions between hard and soft styles. The
guitar is passionate and demands that everyone
pay attention to it. It has both a rock and a jazzy ,~
feel to it.

. But don’tworry—when the band does sing,
it reveals that it knows how to handle voices, as
well as instruments. And it would never dare
drown out the guitar.

Team USA wrestler ready for season

Heavyweight wrestler Ryan Tomei recounts his experience on the USA wrestling team

Ben Duignan
Staff Writer

Pitt heavyweight wrestler Ryan
Tomei returned from his sec-
ond practice of the day and had
no place to wash his workout
clothes.

“All of the washers and driers
were taken up,” Tomei said. “So

I decided to ﬁll up the bathtub

with water and wash my clothes

is in there.”

The next day, he had clean
clothes for practice but had
flooded his room in the pro-
cess.

“When you have a bunch of
wrestlers coming back from
practice, all with dirty clothes
and only a few washing ma-
chines, there’s going to be a
problem,” Tomei said.

That’s because the heavy-
weight was rooming with hun-

~ ‘ dreds of the best wrestlers from

around the world, and there

simply weren’t enough washing
machines for all of them.
Tomei was one of two heavy-

, weights — and 10 wrestlers se-

lected overall —— to represent
USA wrestling in Poland during
the August competition.

His team competed at the
Ziolkowski International in
Warsaw, which hosted compe-
titions from top nations all over
the world.

After a wrestling workout
this summer, assistant coachja-
son Peters approached Tomei.

“Coach [Jason] Peters came
up to me and asked me if I want-
ed to join the USA delegation
to compete in Poland,” Tomei
said. “It didn’t take me too long
to respond. I was quick to ac-
cept.”

Peters also made the trip
with the USA delegation, se-
lected as one of two coaches to
lead the team.

“It’s always a great oppor-
tunity to coach the best wres-

tlers in the country,” Peters
said. “You’re coaching young
guys who hopefully are going to
make national teams and Olym-
pic teams in the future.”

The junior heavyweight from
Irwin, Pa., took part in a very
active summer filled with in-
tense training and competition,
which he believes made his trip
to Poland possible.

“Pitt was sending me a lot of

Assistant coach Jason Peters and heavyweight Ryan Tomei participated in the Ziolkowski International in
Warsaw, Poland.

places to compete,” Tomei said.
“They invested a lot of money in
me and gave me the opportunity
to represent Pitt on a national
scale.”

It didn’t take very long for
the University’s investment to
pay off.

The heavyweight placed ﬁfth
at the U.S. Open and fourth at
the" World Team Trials. His suc-
cess at these two events made
Tomei a top candidate to join
the USA wrestling team.

Tomei remembered what it
was like to learn he would rep-
resent Pitt,» and his country, in
international competition._

“I was really excited when I
found out,” Tomei said. “I had
never been overseas before, and
I didn’t know what to expect,
but I knew that it would be an
unbelievable experience.”

His excitement wasn’t
paired with fear, as one might
expect.

“I wasn’t nervous at all,”
Tomei said. “I knew got chosen
for a reason. I was just going
there to show the world what
Pitt wrestling was all about.”

The junior trained at the
Polish Olympic training cen-
ter, scrimmaging against other
countries before competing.

While Tomei said he wasn’t
fully content with his results at
the event, the heavyweight said
he went through an unparal-
leled learning experience-

Tomei lost in the first round
to Bulgarian heavyweight Dimi-
tar Kumchev, who represented
his country in the world cham-
pionships.

“I didn’t do all that well in
the tournament,” Tomei said.

“But I tried to take in as much
as I could, learn as much as I
could, and it was unbelievable
what I was able to take away
from my time there.”

Tomei recalled his time
working out with wrestlers
from around the world as the
key to his development.

“I worked out with a couple
of Russian heavyweights, and
they taught me so much,” Tomei
said. “I changed my techniques
so much, almost a complete 360
degrees.”

As the projected starting
heavyweight for the Panthers
this upcoming season, Tomei
will try to take what he learned
overseas to improve his game
this year.

Peters thinks that the oppor-
tunity to compete in Poland will
have a profound impact on the
Pitt wrestling program.

“It is a huge step for this pro— ,

gram from a recruiting basis,”
Peters said. “It shows there are
things after collegiate wrestling
here. You can make a world
team at Pitt.” ‘

Tomei said he knows that
even though he was the one who
was selected to compete from
his school, several of his team-
mates are capable of wrestling
on an international level.

“It just shows that there are
wrestlers at Pitt that can com-
pete at the highest level,” Tomei
said. “I know there are other
guys on this team that can do
what I did.”

If that’s the case, Tomei will

HoWard’s death an  

Ii‘?

unexpected tragedy

 

c

Connecticut seniorjasper Howard died from stab wounds in an incident after a
university—sanctioned dance on Saturday night.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Whenjasper Howard committed to Connecti- -

cut to play football three years ago, he thought
it was a safe choice. Not because of anything to
do with sports, though. Howard grew up in a
rough neighborhood in Miami butwas headed
to rural Storrs, Conn., for college — the ﬁrst
person in his family to do so — far away from
rough inner city life, tucked away in a safe and

~ secluded campus. ‘

“All I wanted him to do was go to school
and get an education, and he was doingwhatl
asked him to do,”Joanglia Howard, his mother,
told WSVN—TV in Miami.

What occurred this past Sunday, then, was
at the height of cruel irony. Howard died from a
single stab wound to the abdomen on UConn’s
campus following a school dance in the student
union. He was 20 years old.

Howard, a junior, had started every game
as comerback for the Huskies since his sopho-
more year. On Saturday, he helped his team to
a 38-25 win over Louisville with a career—high
11 tackles. It was homecoming weekend.

That night, Howard was celebrating with
fellow students. Police say that at about 12:30
a.m., a ﬁght broke out after a ﬁre alarm was
pulled during a university—sanctioned dance
that evacuated about 300 students. Howard
and teammate Brian Parker suffered stab

Howard’s death affects family, campus

Football < 20

wounds after the evacuation. Parker’s inju-
ries were reportedly minor, but Howard was
airlifted to a Hartford hospital. By that time,
it was too late.

Shock waves ran through the campus.
Storrs, typically considered a sheltered en-
clave of student life, had transformed into a
crime scene.

“It’s pretty scary that it happened right
on the center of campus, which is where you

would think you are the safest,” Laurenjacobs,
a Connecticut senior, said. “Everyone is really
sad and shocked about it and wants to ﬁnd who
did it really badly.”

Police have issued awarrant for arrest fora
person believed to be the perpetrator.

Howard was an expectant father, his girl-
friend pregnant with their ﬁrst child. Before
the child ever took its ﬁrst breath, its father
took his last. The bright and well—dese_rved

future of Howard will never be known, but
what do we make of the unborn and its future?
It will endure a life without a father, a life taken
in utter foolishness and despicableness.
Throughout this week, the UConn commu-
nity planned several events in memoriam of its

_ fallen peer. Tuesday called for a day of silence,

and students wore dark clothing. Wednesday, a
cand1e—lit vigil was held. Today and tomorrow,
a day of reﬂection will be held where students

will write notes of memories or feelings of
Howard. On Saturday, the school will gather
at the student union and watch their football
Huskies play West Virginia. Aformal memorial
service will be held in the near future.

Certainly, these events will help to ease
the collective pain of the student body. No
memorial, though, will give life back to How-
ard. From now until forever, he is gone, all
too prematurely. Howard’s death is the latest
reminder of how many in this world venture
through life with little perspective.

Did the person who stabbed Howard in-
tend to kill him? Was he killed in cold blood?
Perhaps not, but no matter what the reason,
one’s sense of reality has to be off—kilter to do
something like this.

In the most unlikely of places, the most
unexpected of things happened.
