Reforms Approved

Newman proposed that only
some psyeliology eourses be per-
rriitted to fulfill tiatiiral seienee
reqiiirernents, and ' that students
take eore seienee eourses.

History professor Robert
(Iolodny said that students should
he ahle.to understand hasie seien-
tifie theories.

“We've redueed the Inatli
requirernent to the poitit where it’s
a silly joke," he said. “If we proeeed
to do this with thenattiral seienees,
we'll turn Pitt into a football (‘ol-
lege, a Notre Dame without the

theology." .
Professor Vietor Sehmidt of
geology said that students are

“inherently i‘L,-'nor‘ant about
seit-tree" and that they don’t take
physieal seienee eourses heeause
“they regard them as being too
ltard.

“Students don’t like to work
hard," he said. “They want to take
what they regard as easier
seieriees." -

Schmidt said after the Ineeting
that lie meant soeiety and not just
stitdents are basieally uninfornied
about seienee.

Newman's atnendrtient passed
after the wording was (hanged
frotn requiring courses eonsisting
of “basic science" to ones of science
“prineiples."

The FAS also approved the
implementation section of the
reforins, but defeated an aInend—
Inent that woitld have made bian-
ntial review and student evaluation
of the eourses rnandatory.

(Iomplaints about the Inanda—
tory evaluations and review eame

department faculty, who argued
that tliepreseneeoltwostudents on

would provide adequate student

The reforms will he imple-
Inented by seven eommitt.ees—one
for eaeh area in the reforrns—who

will oversee and approve or reject
new eourses.

The original amendment. pro-
posed hy the PAS eouneil and (IAS
eouneil, stated that |)iannual
review and student evaluation of
courses would he Inandatory.

Student government spokesper-
son Linda ()'(Ionner termed the
defeat of the reviews as “really
sad." She said student evaluations
would have heen extra-input into
the review proeess.

“I really wonder if the professors
are afraid of sornetliing."
()'(lonner saidn

I.iIigiiistiI‘s professor Sarali
'l‘liom'.ison defentled stiidetit

evaluations.

“Students have theright toeheek

All Students Pay for Vandalism

By KEVIN McKEOWN
And DIANE SCIULLO

Pitt dorm students contribute
;tp[)l‘()xlll11ll(‘l\' $23 per resident to
cover costs related to vaiidalisin—

regardless of who is responsiblt‘.

said James N. Beavers. business
manager in the Office of Residence
Life.

" Take l..3 percent of your rooni
and board rate and that’s what slu-
deiits pay for vandalism." Beavers
said. “We feel this is the fairest way:
across-the-board and just put it 11.1
and calculate it with the room and
boartlirate."

The Ullice of Residence Life
atiiiotiticed a series of room and
board rate hikes in March. They
3ttti'ibuted the rate hike to “the cost
of utilities. food, labor and neces-

sary building repairs and
renovations."

“There’s no reason for not say-
ing that vandalism is a cause of
room and board increases. It's just
asstnned," said Donovan Hughes,
director of housing and food
services.

Hughes said the across—the-
board method of charging costs
due to vandalism was initiated
when a clause in the housing con-
tract that stated students would be
individually charged for damages
was retnoved in I977 because of stit-
(leiit opposition.

“W e were convinced by student
input to take oitt the housing
clause in housing contracts
because it did not follow the due
process of law." Hughes said.

Slow
Death

It riritst lraye heen quite a shock for those in the
Pittshurgli acaderiiic coiriiiiiiiiity who picked tip
Monday’s edition of '1‘/ieI’1'H Neur.s‘ and foitrid that
Pitt's School of Medicine was not only in deht once
again. hirt was in danger of losing its accreditatiori.

The woes of the medical school are nothing new.
It has heeri facing logarithmic ttiition increases since
the early l970s, and its year-end deficit has hovered
around theilél million mark each year since 1975. But
at the end of this school year, the deficit will reach
$2.8 million, even after this past suinnier’s wliop-
ping tuition increase to $9,100 for first-year resident
students and $l3,l50 for first-year rion—residerit stu-
(lerits. What's more startling is that unless the iiiedi-
cal school gets many of its fiscal and administrative
matters in order, the school may lose its accredita-
tion at the end of l983. _

Part of the prohleiii is that Pitt and the state Legis-
lature have fottrid theniselyes tied into a vicious
ftrrrdirig circle. The state wants its medical schools
churning otit more resident general practitioners to
help the rural areas of Pennsylvania. The iiredical
schools are churning oirt these students, hut upon
graduation they're forced into the higlily-priced spe-
cially fields in order to pay for the almost proliihitiye
riiedical school dehts.

The circle is completed when the iiredical schools
l)laine the state I.egislature for their tuition proh-
leriis. citing the I.egislature's failure to adequately
appropriate firrids to the schools. As Dr. Donald
I.eon. dean of Pitt's School of Medicine, indicated in
a special report to (Loy. Richard 'l‘hornl)iirgh, “Tlie
failure of the (Ioninioriwealth to increase its appro-
priation with inflation since l972 is the direct cause
of Pitt haying the highest pirhlic iiredical school
tuition is the United States, and the uriiyersity hay‘-
ing to suhsidile each iriedical stirderit oyer $5,0()() per
year. '

The questions that now faceeyery student. profes-
sor. adiiiiriistrator and alumnus who pours money
into the Pitt coffers are quite simple: Where is Pitt
getting the riioriey to make irp this deficit? What
actions will l)e taken to solve the accreditation prof)-
leriis? And how iiittcli will that cost?

Since l975. the itniyersity has had to diyert iirore
than $12.9 million frorii its generaloperation hirdget
to cover the differen.ce hetweeii the medical school's
experiditirres and reyeiiues. It stands to reason that
the uniyersity will once again hail out the riredical
school, and once again it will rise riroiiey sirpplied hy
the tuition of eyery urrdergr'aduate. graduate and
rioir—riiedical professiorial student attending the
ttniyersity.

The prohlenrs of the iiredical school are too riririd-
hoggling. and the scope of the answers would he too
grandiose for us to offer airy type of solution. One
departed medical school "professor recently likened
the school's plight to die 'l'itanic, or to a cancer
patient dying a slow. lingering death. We hope
things have not yet reached that crisis stage. We urge
the university and the state I.egislature to l)riirg
sorne iriiiiiediate resolye to this situation helore the
entire university coiiiriiiirrity is swallowed into the
acaderiiic sinkhole that is slowly deyeloping in the
northwest corner of the Pitt campus.

The Tough Part:
Acting Christmas

By DIANE SCIULLO

\\'hile doing some holiday t lean-
ing. I carire across a crisp, yellowed
newspaper clipping. lhe date had
heerr torn off. l)ltl l corrld see it was
a coltiiirrr hy Sidney llarris entitled
"'l‘rue .\Ieaning of (Ihristrnas." l
know some folks ririglit not like
Sidney llarris. and soiiietiiiies I
don't either. hut for once he had a

legitimate. interesting’ point to
iiiake.
llarris' contention was that

nearly everyone coiiiplains that
(I|iristriias' is "too coiiniiercial"...
too rrrarry trees. too riiariy lights.
too riiariy shopping malls. He went
on to say. lroweyer‘. that the corri-
riierciali/atiorr could heoyerlooked
hy anyone who wants to take the
day. serioitsly. lnstead. the real
trouhle is that the holiday is “too
spiritual" in the wrong way. He
explains it this way:

'l‘he 'l'hree Wise i\len. the Star" of
Betlileheiir and the Babe in the
nianger———tlie mystery‘ ar.id the
ririracle——inake it terriptirig to
forget what the whole story is
ahoitt. the spiritual aspect heirig
tliflictrlt to separate from the true
rirearririg. The whole message.
llarris says. can he found in these
two passages:

0 "ll airyoiie says ‘I loyc God"
and hates his hrotlier. he is a liar."
(I john -l:2(l)

O "lrrasinircn as you did it to one
of the least of these, riiy hretlrren.
you did it unto riie."(i\lattliew

_‘_’:'): lll)

If (Ilrristrii;is——tlre Mass of
(Ihrist——does not rirearr this to us,
then what we prat rice is magic and
srtperstitiorr. ;\cts of coiiternpt.
rejection injustice or neglect

toward the least. the lowest. the"“

poorest and the weakest are acts
against llirii. Without the iireaii-
irig of these two hihlical passages.
Harris said, the whole structure of
(Ilrristianity falls apart, and we
have nothing hrit another pririii-
tiye religion that “may coriifort rrs
l)iit is powerless to change us."

We tend to mistake lorrii for suh—
stance. prayers for perlorriiarice.
worship for practice. and given. he
concludes, that (Iliristiariity is air
“intensely practical" religion fray-
ing its moral roots in the" acute
social conscience of _litdaisnr, it
was not designed toclrarrge the way
riieri think or helieye as rirticlr as to
change the way they act.

ln other words, it is easy to think
(Iliristriras and easy to helieye
(lhristriias. hut soriretinies impossi-
hly hard to act (lliristriias. A plea-
sant. early (Ilrristiiras present from
llarris. I tliotrglit. hecause it
doesn't really matter if you're
(Iliristian. _]ewish or .\luslini-—it's
just soriietliiiig to keep in mind the
next trriie you go to heat the other

CFA and NCAA Square Offat Convention

mind. There is a great deal of‘

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

After a four-rnoritli truce. the
tug-of-war resumes tomorrow
between the NCAA and its splinter
group. the Collegiate Football
Associatioti, over, the reorganiza-
tion of Division I-A football and
television property rights. All that
is at stake is control over big-tirne
college football.

()ne of the legislative proposals
before the two-day NCAA special
convention in St. Louis is a plan to
establish a new division that would
“include the CFA’s til nieinbers,
plus two CFA hoIdotits-- the Big
Ten and Pacific-I0 Confereiices.
That group of 8] schools, now part
of the I37-member I)ivisioii I-A,
would be known as l)ivisioii IV.

The CFA -—- which includes
schools such as Pitt, Penn State.
Oklahoma and Georgia—is back-
ing the proposal to gain what it
calls “greater control of our own
destinies."

The statement translates to a
desire for more exclusive control of
most legislative aii(l regulatory
functions concerning the larger
football schools. The reorganiza-
tion proposal also stems from the
CFA's desire to gain greater control
over its television or “property
rights", especially as they pertain

- to football.

While athletic directors from
three schools——Cas Myslinski of
Pitt, Wade Walker of ()klahoma,
and Al Paul of Columbia———alI
agree some type of reorganization
within the NCAA will occur. they
also agree that the issueof property
rights will be settled in the court
room and not at the convention.

Both Myslinski and Walker said
it is doubtful the NCAA will back
off of its claim as the sole negotiat-
ing agent for college football tele-
vsion contracts.

Currently, _ approval of the
NCAA's football television con-

tract is subject to a vote by the

entire 800-plus NCAA ineinber-
ship.

Under the present oiie-scliool,

one-vote NCAA system, there are

now over 500 schools voting on the
NCAA's football television cori-
tract, even though they do not field
a team tlieriiselves, according to
Pitt Senior Vice Cliaticellor ‘lack
Freeinan.

“One school, one vote—it's irra-
tional," Freeman said recently.
“The CFA is proposing (instead) to
place Division IV in control of its
own football television contracts.
It would ptit control over the rules
and regulations of the larger iiisti—
tutions into the hands of the
schools that play the kind of foot-
ball that geiierates TV reveiine."

It is precisely the promise of
greater revenues, frorii both iiet-
work and cable television, that
prompted the CFA to intensify its
five-year-old push for reorganiza-
tion. _

In August, the group threatened
to enact its own football television
contract with NBCsliortlyafterthe
NCAA announced it had reached
an agreement with ABC and CBS.

The NCAA, threatened with the
loss of its top drawing cards, corri-
proniised by calling tomorrow's
special convention to consider the
CFA's reorganization proposals. -

CFA F.xecutive Director Clitick
Neinas has called the Division IV
proposal a "clearcut alternative" to
other less drastic NCAA reorgani-
zation plans which call for slight
revisions in the criteria for mem-
bership in the current top two div-
isioiis. I-A and I-AA.,

Neinas said his groiip’s prop-

osal using CFA in-enibership cri-
teria as the basic criteria for Div-
ision IV membership, will not
require any moving of teams
within divisions. The CFA prop-
osal would rather “traiisplant" a
group of niajor-——and high spend-
ing football schools——into a new
legislative division that allows
them to consider by theniselves
inattes that “solely affect them."

()r. as r'reenian said. .“What
we're saying is the controls over
college football and college rtiles
belong with the big schools that
make the investineiit."

 

1‘ v.-i,§:»_9v:‘,;-

   

m 

The argument is not a new one
and, it should be pointed out, one
that the entire NCAA membership
Iias voted down in past attempts at
reorganization.

Tlieiiiost adamantopposition to
the (IFA, not surprisingly. has
come from the smaller schools and
current nieinbers of I)ivisioii I-A,
like the Ivy League schools, who
stand to lose if the CFA version of
reorgani/ation goes tlnougli.

Most Ivy League schools cannot
match the CI<‘A-pr‘opose(l criteria
for l)ivi_sioii IV niemhersliip.
which would iiicltide:

O A niinimuin of eight varsity
sports, including football.

0 At least 70 percent of the fool-
ball schedule against Division IV
opponents.

Presents a Lecture by

. ‘Jé .i"'I;.‘ *1“  " . f  I  " '
Deeeiii her 2; I98 I

0 An average paid attendance of
20.(l()(l over the preceding three-
year period.

0 A staditirii with a iiiiiiiriitiiri of
3(),()()fI permanent seats.

The CFA has said ifa school falls
short of the requirerneiits, it could
still bea nieinberof Division IV if it
belongs to a corilererice where riiore
than half of those nieinbers meet
the requireinents.

liven with the above loophole,
the Ivy League, as well as coiifereii—
ces like the Mid—Anierica Confer-
ence, would not qualify for
Division IV, which would replace
I-A as the glaniour division of col-
Iege football.

The losses for those schools left
behind, says Paul of Columbia,
would be in prestige, scheduling.
media exposure, and ability to
compete for recruits. "

Though Paul admits it would be
“foolish" for the Ivy League to
contend its teams are on the same
competitive level with most of the
members of the CFA. he questions
the CFA's definition of an institu-
tion's corninittiiieiit to athletics, a
definition that Patil says is
unjustly based on money spent and
money generated. y

“We sponsor I2 to I8 men's pro-
grams and up to I3 women's. sowe
do have a major coniiiiittineiit to
major college athletics in general,"
Patil said. “We are iiatioiial-type
instittitioiis who were very much
involved in the beginning of the
NCAA. We're not a threat to tlierii
(the CFA). There is room for all
levels, including otir level of foot-
ball, in one division."

But while Paul would like to see
things remain at the status quo, he

“I think they would Iiavea diffi-

“()kI;iIionia is having financial

this effort," Walker said.

“If generating more money is the
outcome of all this, line, you her.
We are more interested in generat-

Walker added.

Walker agreed that different lev-
