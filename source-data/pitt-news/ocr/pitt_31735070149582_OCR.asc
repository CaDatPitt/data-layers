Freedo
Rider

speaks
at Pitt

By Gwen Barney
Senior Staff Writer

Freedom Rider Diane Nash put on
a brave face in the presence of ra-
cial violence and hatred as a leader
in the civil rights movement, but
Tuesday night one question almost
brought her to tears.

During the question—and-an-
swer portion of Nash’s lecture,
hosted by Pitt’s Black Action So-
ciety, one student stood up and
asked her how she felt when Martin
Luther Kingjr. was assassinated.

After a long pause, Nash an-

’ swered.

“It devastated me,” she said,
with the emotion of that day still
fresh in her eyes. “I don’t think the
vacuum that he left has been ﬁlled
yet. That’s a really hard thing to
put into words. Martin certainly
wasn’t a man who deserved any-
thing like tha .”

Nash, most famous for her ef-
forts in the Freedom Rides of the
1960s, spoke to_ an audience of
more than 50 people in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom. The speech,
which focused on Nash’s time as
a Freedom Rider and lessons on
social change, is part of a week full
of Black Action Society-sponsored
events to honor King and other
civil rights leaders.

“We want to remind people that
while Martin Luther King Jr. was
a face of the movement, he was
one face of the movement. While
we appreciate the life and legacy
of Martin Luther Kingjr., we also
recognize the importance of other
people crucial to the civil rights
movement,” Black Action Society
President Halim Genus said.

Nash agreed with Genus’s senti-
ment on the importance of other
leaders.

“There couldn’t have been a
better spokesman [for the civil
rights movement] than Dr. King,

The Pitt women’s basketball team
didn’t just lose on Tuesday night —
it lost in record-setting fashion.

The Panthers’ 76-point loss to
No. 2 Notre Dame (19-1, 6-0 Big
East), 120-44, marked their worst
defeat in the program’s history,
a record previously held by Pitt’s
69-point loss to Connecticut in
2002. The game also fell just two
points shy of a Big East record for
largest margin of defeat, currently
held by a 78-point Providence loss
to Connecticut in 1998. 4,

Pitt holds conference on Europea Union debt

crisis

Professors remain optimistic about the outcome of the current economic situation in Europe.

Byjoe Chilson
For The Pitt News

As the European Union ﬁnds itself
deep in an international debt cri-
sis, three professors foresee posi-
tive outcomes for the economic
union. -~

Pitt’s European Union Center of
Excellence sponsored an hour-long
video conference in David Law-
rence Hall Tuesday during which
EUCE Director Ronald Linden and
representatives from Pitt, the Uni-
versity of North Carolina and the
University of Illinois discussed
the current economic situation in
Europe.

The EUCE is one of the six
studies centers in Pitt’s University
Center for International Studies.
According to the center’s website,
EUCE promotes the study of the

European Union and its relations
to the United States. Through the
center, students can receive certiﬁ-
cates in European Union Studies
and West European Union Stud-
ies.

In 2001, Greece joined the eu-
rozone, a monetary union whose
members share a common curren-
cy as part of their membership in
the European Union.

By 2004, however, it was re-
vealed that Greece’s deﬁcit had
never been below 3 percent of GDP,
the level required for countries to
join the eurozone. After years of
undergoing austerity measures
such as cutting pensions, elimi-
nating beneﬁts for government
workers and reducing other so-
cial spending, the Greek economy
began to contract quickly in 2009.
The government responded with
further measures in attempts to
align spending with revenue, but

the decisions were met withviolent
riots in the streets of Greece.

Though the Greek government
accepted a German bailout last
year, the country stillteeters on
the verge of bankruptcy.

“Who’s being bailed out? It’s
not the people of Greece. It’s the
banks,” said Christiane Lemke, a
visiting political science professor
at UNC from Leibniz University of
Hannover.

Lemke labeled the debt crisis a
“crisis of legitimacy.” She said she
has hope that the EU will come out
of the crisis with a new form of
economic governance.

Lemke said that the prevalent
protest movements across Europe
as well as the resignation of several
European governments — such as
that of former Italian Prime Minis-
ter Silvio Berlusconi — in the past
few months could be a sign that the
debt crisis is causing Europeans

. . - , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

to lose faith in private banks and
the ability of the public sector to
regulate them.

Alberta Sbragia, Pitt vice pro-
vost for graduate studies and for-
mer director of EUCE, said that she
thought the European debt crisis

, might push the countries of the EU

toward greater integration.

Sbragia warned that the popu-
lar calls for an end to the EU were
short—sighted and that the crisis
could have a major effect on the
U.S. if it does not end well. She said
roughly half of U.S. corporate prof-
its come from Europe, and that
percentage could be jeopardized
if the crisis isn’t solved.

Even though most of the 30 Pitt
attendees at the video conference
were majoring in political science
or economics, Sbragia said that the
European debt crisis should matter
to “all students who are interested
in the world.” I

The 2012 Student Government
Board continues to form after the

induction of committee chairs‘

Tuesday night.

At their weekly meeting in
Nordy’s Place, Board members
welcomed the seven new students
who will lead committees within
the Board and congratulated the in-
dividuals on their new positions.

“You all have tremendous shoes
to ﬁll,” Board member Halim Ge-
nus said, adding that the preceding
chairs played a role in achieving 24
percent student voter turnout at the
SGB elections in November, extend-
ing library hours and organizing
the largest Pitt Day in Harrisburg
last year.

The Board voted to add a Com-
munity Outreach Committee this
term to work with individual or-

ganizations on campus and cre-

ate community service projects
in Oakland and Pittsburgh. Web-
master was eliminated as a formal
chair position, but Board Presi-
dent James Landreneau said that
he will continue to work with the
former webmaster to update the
SGB website.

The 2012 chairs are C._]. Stavra-
kos for Academic Affairs, Michael
Nites for Allocations, Mary Mal-
lampalli for Community Outreach,
Armie Brown for Elections, Rachel
Meyerfor Environmental Relations,
Robert Beecher for Governmen-
tal Relations, Emily Crawford for

Judicial, Shannon Held for Public
Relations and Richard White for
Transportation and Safety.

In the open ﬂoor segment of the
SGB meeting, six students grabbed
the microphone to speak to the
Board about reinstating the Col-
legiate Readership Program.

The program, funded by the Stu-
dent Activities Fund, distributed
copies of The New York Times and

USA Today around campus. The
program was suspended over win-
ter break with a general consensus
from the Board and SGB advisor
Kenyon Bonner.

The students who spoke at the
meeting were not only Student
Activities Fee-paying non—College
of General Studies students, but

~ also recent graduates and medical

school students.

The suspension of the program
revolved around the ability of stu-
dents from Pitt’s schools that do not
contribute to the Student Activities
Fund to pick up the papers.

After the halt of the program, a
replica edition of the two newspa-
pers remains available to students
online through their my.pitt por-
tal. ‘

One member who spoke out
said, “Yes, the replica edition is
online. It’s terrible.”

Landreneau acknowledged that
the online version, which is still
available to students, is “clunky

.p,,;n.

software.”

“I’m moving as fast as I can so
the Board can vote for the next
public meeting,” Landreneau said
about the program. He hopes to

hold a vote with the Board about 2

whether or not they will continue
the program and add locked drop
boxes.

Landreneau said at the meet-
ing that he spoke with a University
architect about the implementa-
tion of locked drop boxes around
campus that would limit papers
pick-up to only Student Activities
Fee-paying non—College of General
Studies students.

Landreneau announced that his ’

town hall forum initiative — which
is meant to allow students to voice
their concernsto the Board in a
less formal way — will take place
the ﬁrst Tuesday of every month
one hour before the Board’s pub-
lic meeting. He did not specify the
location of the forum.

CHARLESTON, s.c. — Time is running out ,
for anyone to stop Mitt Romney from,win-
ning the South Carolina Republican primary
Saturday, perhaps the last chance to keep
him from running away with the party’s

‘ presidential nomination.

Newt Gingrich hopes that his aggres-
sive, crowd-pleasing debate performance
Monday night'— always the oxygen for
his campaign —- will feed a surge of last-
minute support.

Rick Santorum is hoping that the late
backing of national social conservatives
will turn into a grassroots uprising for him
in the Palmetto State.

I ‘But Romney leads polls by double-digit
margins. And he’s using his well-ﬁnanced
campaign to build a ﬁrewall in the state’s

- most conservative counties to guard against

voters surging late to a challenger, as they
did to Mike Huckabee in 2008.

The likely result? The former Massa-
chusetts governor could easily see his lead
erode, but his competitors remain divided.
They still face an onslaught of Romney cam-
paign tools, and they might not be able to
deny him a clear win.

“There’s no way that the opposition
against Romney can form up,” said David
Woodard, a Clemson University political
scientist who’s also a Republican consul-

MCT Campus

 

leads with the support of about 32 percent
of likely South Carolina voters, according
to an average of recent public surveys by
RealClearPolitics.com.

Gingrich, a former speaker of the House
of Representatives, has about 22’percent.
Santorum, a former senator from Pennsyl-
vania, has about 14 percent, as does U.S.
Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.

Gov. Rick Perry trails far behind in last
place. All those polls were taken before
Monday night’s debate, at which Romney
came under attack and was ‘sometimes
shaken.

Gingrich delivered a commanding per—

formance, at one point bringing the Re— T

publican audience to its feet cheering with
his deﬁant statement that America kills
its enemies. T ,

Eager to build on the momentum, Ging-
rich pressed South Carolina voters Tuesday
to rally behind him as the only one who can
stop Romney.

“If you vote for Sen. Santorum, in effect
you’re functionally voting for Gov. Romney
to be the nominee, because he’s not going
to beat him,” Gingrich said in Florence, S.C.
“The only way you can stop Gov. Romney,
for all practical purposes, is to vote for Newt
Gingrich  It’s a mathematical fact now.”

Santorum is pressing hard as well, look-
ing for social conservative support to grow
since a gathering of national movement
leaders decided Saturday to back him.

but I don’t think its correct to dis-
count the other geniuses of the
movement. There were other people
whose contributions were as great
as Martin Luther King Jr.’s” Nash
said.

_ Nash said that she worked closely
with King through her involvement
with the Freedom Rides, even going
on a double—date with her husband
and King and his wife Coretta.

“Martin probably had mixed
feelings about me personally,” Nash
said. “He probably thought I was a
pain in the neck, but he acted re-
spectfully most of the time.”

Nash served as coordinator of

the Nashville Freedom Ride. Her
job included speaking to the press,
recruiting more Riders and gaining
national support for the Freedom
Riders’ cause. Freedom Rides were
trips across several states, usually
beginning in northern states and
ending in southern states. The Rides
protested segregation of interstate
transportation, such as Greyhound
buses.

“Our oﬂice was open 24/7,” Nash
said. “Pretty soon we had Freedom
Riders coming from all over the
country.”

In her speech, Nash connected
her involvement in the civil rights
movement to the steps necessary
for young people today to conduct
similar social change through non-
violence.

While a student at Fisk Univer-
sity in Nashville, Tenn., Nash took
classes in nonviolent direct action

Society and the University community.

and passive resistance under the
tutelage of the Rev. James Lawson,
an expert on the subject.

“I was in the right place at the
right time,” she said. ,

In 1960, at the age of 22, Nash
found a project in Nashville, Tenn.,
to test nonviolent direct action in
the desegregation of segregated
lunch counters. Nash led several of
her contemporaries in sit-ins at six
eateries with segregated lunch coun-

ters, known as the Nashville Sit-ins.
They successfully desegregated the
counters.

During this time, Nash also co-
founded the Student Nonviolent Co-
ordinating Committee, a civil rights
activism group whose membership
primarily consisted of college stu-
dents and other young African

. Americans.

Nash enumerated the lessons
that young people who are looking
to bring about social change might
learn from the civil rights move-
ment.

“People are never the enemy,”
Nash said. “You can love and respect
the person while ﬁghting their un-
just ideas.” .

She also warned students not to
succumb to oppression.

“Oppression always requires the
cooperation of the oppressed,” Nash
said. “The day the blacks decided
there would notbe segregated buses
in Montgomery, there were no more
segregated buses in Montgomery.”

Nash emphasized that refusing
to cooperate with her oppressors
was a step she and the Freedom Rid-
ers took in achieving integration.

“We changed ourselves into peo-
ple who could not be segregated. We
said, ‘Shoot us, if that’s what you’re
going to do, but we will not be seg-
regated,”’ she said.

Most of the students who attend-
ed the speech kept their rapt atten-
tion on Nash for the entire duration
of her 90-minute speech. Many ap-
proached Nash afterwards for pic-
tures and autographs as well.

“I wanted to hear her story,”
sophomore Macy McCollum said.
“I haven’t had a lot of ﬁrsthand
exposure to the civil rights move-
ment. You hear about it in books and
movies, but until you hear someone
speak about it you don’t get the full
grasp of it.”

Joel James, a 2010 Pitt gradu-
ate, said he was most impressed by
the emphasis Nash and her fellow
Freedom Riders put on achieving
their objective of equality forfuture
generations. .

“They were not just thinking
about themselves, but they looked
to the future. That requires a level
of unselﬁshness that’s just para-
mount,” he said. I

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

a

Bureau’s arrivalilong overdue

New consumer bureau vows to defend us small fries

By Matt Schaff
Columnist

The streets of Oakland are sprawl
ing with little guys. "

No, not physically littl
— Pitt manages to compet
in D-I basketball after all. ..
Financially little.

It’s true: Most people like me
who show up to class and. call
themselves University students
are thousands of times smaller
than many hedge fund manag-
ers and corporate CEOs, that
is, if we’re talking net worth or
annual income.

Surely, being little in this way
allows us to worry less about kid-
nappers trying to squeeze us of

ransom money or distant rela-

tives extending ulterior—motive-
derived kindness. But all too often
our smallness confers unsavory
vulnerability, especially when it

. comes to having to make consum-

er decisions. For example, even a
part-time paycheck from Starbucks
won’t allow a college student to pay
for both tuition and a lawyer to
conﬁrm that his credit—card issuer
isn’t scamming him. At least when
it comes to traversing an enormous
marketplace full of carefully set
booby-traps, little guys need big
help. And that’s why we students
need to appreciate — and rejoice
in — the sheer magnitude of what’s
now happening in Washington. We
also need to tell our congressmen
to make sure it doesn’t stop hap-
pening.

In the colorful 1oO—year history
of American progressive reform
that brought us child labor laws,
Social Security, Medicare and the
Affordable Care Act, never has
there existed a fully functioning
federal agency whose sole purpose

, was to look after average consum-

ers. Some governmental bodies
have come close — the Federal Re-
serve, Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and the Securities and
Exchange Commission are typi-
cally charged With policing some
ﬁnancial institutions’ open-market
behavior, thereby providing a layer
of protection for small borrowers
and lenders (just don’t Google “SEC
failure” with “Bernie Madoff”). On
the judicial side, class-action law-
suits have dished out consumer

Ill

justice over the years.

But until two weeks ago, no
substantial section of executive-
branch focus was allocated to con-
sumer protection. Now, thanks to
President Barack Obama’s welcome
mobilization of some Oval Office
balls — he made a recess appoint-
ment during the holidays so as to
bypass the intransigent, evidently
consumer-unfriendly Republican
congressional caucus e the times
have officially changed. America’s
ﬁrst Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau is now operational,
and its freshly minted chairman,
Richard Cordray, is ready to play
some serious defense (on the part
of the little guy, of course).

The 2010 Dodd—Frank Act —
which, although heavily contest-
ed by regulation-averse special
interests, for now is still on the
books — charges the CFPB with
“implementing the Federal con-
sumer ﬁnancial laws through rules,
orders, guidance, interpretations,
statements of policy, examinations
and enforcement actions.” To en-
force and supplement enforcement
of such laws, the CFPB is supposed
to create several ofﬁces, includ-
ing an office of research to analyze
market behavior, especially the de-
velopment of ﬁnancial products

created to mislead consumers, an
office of fair lending and equal op-
portunity and, my personal favor-
ite; an office of ﬁnancial education
to educate consumers on, among
other things, how to develop long-
term savings strategies. After his
nomination, Cordray announced
that his ﬁrst priority would be to
rein in the non—bank ﬁnancial in-
stitutions often skipped by current
regulators, according to The New
York Times.

A bureau like the CFPB should
have been here all along. A proﬁt-
valuing, market-based economy
with a few resourceful producers,
many resource-less consumers,
imperfect information and what I
like to call the weaknesses of the
human brain — i.e., manipulable
from the optimal-decision-making

ideal —-— inevitably leads to an in— »

equality of power, providing the
opportunity for wide-scale abuse
of consumers (see: subprime
mortgage crisis). A truly demo-
cratic system is capable of offset-
ting the effects of such inequality
if the masses (consumers) recog-
nize their bad hand and proceed to
tailor their government such that it
tips the balance back toward con-
sumers. Such offsetting should be

How not to show affection in public

Not every couple knows what it should and shouldn’t»d0 in front of other people.

Sarah Reagle‘
For The Pitt News

Winter isa time for coupling up in
Pittsburgh. It’s basically a surviv-
al instinct — two bodies means
more heat on frigid, snowy days.
It’s a good idea, really. So during
the spring semester, you always
see new couples popping up all
over the place. But these ﬂedgling
couples need to be aware of one
of the most contested topics in
the entire world: PDA.

Maybe public displays of af-
fection were necessary in high
school when you had to show

’ your best friend that she wasn’t

the only eighthgrader who could
get a ninth-grade boy. Or maybe
that wasn’t necessary.
However, the rules in the
semi-real world of college are dif-
ferent. If you’re taking cues from

the short-lived pairing of Taylor A

Swift andjake Gyllenhaal, you’re
doingéit‘ wrong. Public displays
of affection are part of a delicate
science. Here’s a quick guide to
acceptable and not-so-acceptable
forms of PDA:

Hand-holding.

Perhaps the most basic form
of PDA, I ﬁnd hand—holding to

be generally acceptable. Hands e
cupped,‘ fingers intertwined —

be my guest.

Hand-holding rarely makes
people want to vomit when they
see it, so it’s a pretty safe activity.
There are, of course, exceptions.
Like if you’re wearing Smittens.
Or putting your hands in each
other’s pockets. That might trig-
ger the gag reﬂex a little.

If you’re that couple who
takes up the entire sidewalk and
refuses to unlink to let people
through, that’s about as OK as
sharing a toothbrush. You know
who you are. '

Kissing.

The only situations in which»

kissing in public is acceptable are
if you’re on an altar, if people are
clinking their glasses all around
you or if you’re saying hello or
goodbye at an airport. ‘ _
Note that this list in no way
includes bars, parties, coffee
shops, classrooms or hallways.

Maybe I’m a prude -7 and obvi— ‘
L ously not European —— but keep

it in your pants.

The way everyone else feels
about you kissing is deﬁnitely
not how one feels while watching
a romantic comedy. Sure, you can
“aww” in the theater. But watch-
ing people kiss in real life triggers
a response that’s sort of like how
you feel when your parents kiss.
N 0 one wants to see that.

Restaurant etiquette.

Having worked as a busser
at a restaurant for a mere three
months, -I saw more than my fair
share of restaurant PDA. And I
can break it down into a couple
situations that just shouldn’t oc-
cur.

Across-the-table hand-hold-
ing — Not OK. It seems harmless.
But it gets awkward fast when
the server comes to set down the
food, and the hands don’t unlink.
And then the server has to try to
fit ﬁve plates on a table already
ﬁlled with arms. Just play foot-

sie under the table at the same
time, and you’ve got the perfect
storm.

Same-side sitters —— I’m not
talking about a double date where
the couples sit on the same side.
That’s acceptable, even normal.
I’m talking about the singular
couple that sits at a four—person
booth and uses just one side. It’s
a booth, not a couch.

The best and subsequently
worstdisplay of same—side sitting
that I’ve witnessed was perpe-
trated by a corporate Santa Claus
type of man and_,_his younger,

blond—haired and faux—nailed '

girlfriend.

I went toﬁll their water glass-
es, andthe woman was obviously
intimidated by my excellence in
bussing and my grimy ponytail.
So she asserted her dominance by
caressing her man’s face with her
hot—pink ﬁngernails and refus-
ing to reply when I asked if she’d
likea reﬁll. Please, Pmlbegging
you, keep this move out of your
repertoire. ,

If you want to have a super-
romantic dinner where you hold
hands, blow air kisses and play
footsie in your stockinged feet,
do it at home. There you can dis-
play your affections as much as
your roommates will tolerate.

Situational exceptions.

There are a couple places _

where PDA — in any form — is
not acceptable. Some of these
places are obvious. Funerals, for
example. Or divorce court. But
there are also places within our
daily lives that shouldn’t involve
PDA. These include coffee shops

where the predominant mood is a
studious one, classrooms and any
part of any academic building.

Regarding the coffee shop,
nobody slaving over a paper or
studying for an exam wants to see
a couple being cutesy. Studying
is miserable enough without hav-
ing to watch someone hold hands
with one hand and flip textbook
pages with the other. How effec-
tive can that sort of studying be
anyway? S

An exception to this exception
is -awkward ﬁrst dates. There are
few things I enjoy more than lis- .
tening to stilted and forced ban-
ter while I’m procrastinating.

As for classrooms, it’s sort of
obvious. Sit next to each other,
but keep it at that. Don’t make
it weird for the rest of us. We’re
there to learn —— or at least to
concentrate on continuing the
collection of doodles in our note-
books.

In a continuation of the class-
room rule, I think it’s strange
when couples have mini-dates
at my favorite study spots in the
Cathedral or elsewhere. It makes
my between—class productive ses-
sions a lot less productive.

As a general rule for PDA, just
think: What would]. Biebs and
Selena Gomez do? And then do
the opposite. Relationships are
super fun and exciting, but you no
longer have to use PDA to prove
your happiness. Try smiling. Or
wearing matching T-shirts. Or
getting matching tattoos. Those
are all much more socially ac-
ceptable alternatives to PDA. I

additional annoying habits, email

But it’s worth ﬁnding out.

That means hoping upcoming
Republican attempts to appeal
Cordray’s appointment fail, or
at least fail to bring down the
bureau altogether — an objec-
tive that any perceptive observer
could identify as the opposition’s
real goal. *

So when it comes to what Pitt
students should think about the
bureau’s fate, here’s something ~
to remember: Little people can

SWIMMING AND QIVING

anthers earnt

 

By Dexter Gulick
Stajfwri ter

The Pitt swimming and diving team
picked up three total victories at
Trees Pool this weekend, but the
Panthers also came together with
their opponents to work toward a

v common goal.

Both the Pitt men’s and women’s
teams competed against the Uni-
versity of Maryland -— the men
won 193.5—159.5 and the women
lost 222-131 — but last weekend’s

, 3, competition might mark the last

time the Panthers and the Terrapins
face off. _

Maryland decided to ax eight
varsity sports in order to deal with
a budget deﬁcit inside its athletic
department. In late November,

' Maryland president Wallace Loh
announced the eight programs to
be cut, and the Terrapin swimming
and diving teams were left with the
daunting task of raising $11.56 mil-
lion before June 30.

Hundreds of teams, including
Pitt, have expressed support for
the imperiled athletes by making
signs and posting them to the “Save
UMD Swimming & Diving” Face-

' book group that has nearly 14,000

members.

Pitt joined the crusade alongside
Big East rival Cincinnati after their
meet in late October, taking a pic-
ture of the two teams holding signs
saying “Save the Terpst” and post-
ing it to the Facebook group. So far,
more than 200 teams have shown
their support in this way.

“That’s what happens with a
university when they need to cut a
program,” Pitt swimmer Hussein
Medhat said. “They go for swim-
ming because they don’t produce
that much proﬁt for the university
as a sport. It’s really sad. Swimming
is one of those sports that are dying
off at the collegiate level.”

But whatever sympathy Medhat
had for the Maryland program (7-4,
1-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) was
left on the deck. The junior took
home two ﬁrsts and a second in his
individual events and then pulled
in another two ﬁrsts and a fourth
in his relay events. His efforts did
much to solidify a lead for the Pitt
men (8-3, 5-2 Big East) late in the
back-and-forth meet.

“On the men’s side, we led Mary-
land by 20 points the ﬁrst day and
pretty much dominated the meet

the ﬁrst day,” Pitt head coach

Bobby Mizia I Sen

Chuck Knoles said. “The second
day Maryland came back, but our
guys stepped up and went one—two-
three in the 500 freestyle to kind of
clinch the win.”

Medhat was the “one” in that
combination, clocking a4:39.67 as
he barely edged out Pitt sophomore
Alex Rodenkirk. He also cruised
past Rodenkirk to take the gold

in the 200-yard freestyle with a

1:40.50.

In the 100-yard freestyle Fri-
day night, Medhat ﬁnished with a
45.27 as he was out-touched by 0.2
seconds by Maryland sophomore
John Hauser.

“He had one of the fastest 200
freestyles for the team, in season,”
Knoles said of Medhat. “This is only
Hussein’s second meet back since
shoulder surgery. His ﬁrst meet
back was against West Virginia‘. So
that bodes well for us moving down
the road.”

Medhat missed the ﬁrst half of
the season because of his surgery.

“Even last week I was pretty sur-
prised by my performance,” Medhat
said. “I had only just started swim-
ming after my surgery. I didn’t see it
coming, but I’m happy about it.”

The Pitt women’s team (8-6, 5-3

Big East) picked up a 240-133 win

hree victories over weeken

Pitt might have faced Maryland for the last time — the team is in danger of losing its program.

f Photograplier
The Pitt swimming and diving team picked up three victories at Trees Pool this weekend in a meet against Maryland, Richmond and Villanova.

over the University of Richmond
(5-7, 0-0 Atlantic 10) and a244-109
victory over Villanova (9-9, 3-4 Big
East).

Joanna Budzis led the way for the
Panthers, taking ﬁrst in all three of
her individual events. The junior has
been streaky this season but ﬁnally
had a‘ dominant performance over
the course of the weekend.

“We hadn’t really had a stellar
performance across the board from
Joanna until this meet,” Knoles said.

_ “She’s an Olympic swimmer from

Poland; we always expect a lot from
her. At this two-day meet she was
stellar. She was the star she was sup-
posed to be.”

Budzis placed ﬁrst in the wom-
en’s 400—yard individual medley on
Friday night with a time of 4:22.14.

‘ She also picked up a sixth-place ﬁn-

ish swimming the backstroke leg of
the 200-yard medley relay (1:47.73)
and a third in the 200-yard freestyle
relay (1:36.51).

' She returned Saturday to take
ﬁrst in the 200-yard individual
medley (2:05.48) and earn a com-
manding win in the 200-yard back-
stroke with a 2:00.80, ﬁnishing
nearly three seconds ahead of her
closest competition.

QREGQRBAN RANTE

A look
at what’s
wrong with

Pitt hoops  

Greg Trietley -
Senior Staff Writer

t

Minutes before tipoff on Monday and
10 rows from the top of the Carrier
Dome, a middle—aged,rnan in bright
orange leaned over and asked me a

' simple question:,‘~‘So what’s wrong

with Pitt?”

I froze. Do I tell him about the in-
juries to point guard Travon Woodall?
About how much everybody misses
center Gary McGhee? Is he going to
ask about the rebel Khem Birch? I

With one six-hour trip behind me
and another six-hour trip to come

after the game, coherent thought '

wasn’t fair to expect. My immediate
answerwas aloud, monotone, “Uhh,”
followed by, “Everything.”
Everything is wrong, I thought.
That proved to be a little over-
dramatic. The Pitt men’s basketball
team——winless‘inthe Big East—— did
enough right that night to hold the
No. 1 team in the nation to its worst
offensive performance in six weeks.
The Panthers lost to the undefeated
Syracuse Orange by eight, 71-63.
The middle-aged man, a loyal,
knowledgeable, pleasant fan (does
Syracuse have any other kind?), saw
he had a rare seat next to someone

wearing something other than an or-

ange hoodie and tookthe opportunity
to learn about Pitt. _

“Tell me about this Wright kid.
What’s going on with him?”

When Cameron Wright entered
Monday’s game off the bench, a
grumble or two rose up from sec-
tion 315. The best way to describe
his game this season is “non-factor.”
Turnovers have dogged Pitt’s back-
court, and Wright has been the most
villainized offender.

“Huh,” the man said. “The guide

has him hitting more ofhis shots than
Gibbs. Thought he might have been
more promising.” ”

He knows his stats. When Wright
shoots, his shootingpercentage, 44.2
percent, is better thanJohnJohnson’s
43.8 percent, Ashton Gibbs’ 38.3
percent, J.J. Moore’s 38 percent and

BASKETBALL

FROM PAGE 1

‘‘[Notre Dame] didn’t miss to-
night. We have the youngest team
in the nation, and our kids were a
little starstruck. But at the same
time, I would rather have my team
come here starstruck than to go play
somewhere else that is meaning-
less.”

The combination of the Fight-
ing Irish’s Big East leading offense
and the Panthers’ conference-worst
defense proved fatal for Pitt as it fell
in its ﬁfth-straight game.

The defeat marked the ﬁrst time
that an opponent reached triple dig-
its against a Berenato-coached Pitt
team. The Panthers (8-11, 0-6 Big
East) last gave up 100-plus points
in the 112-43 loss to Connecticut
in 2002.

Before the loss to the Fighting
Irish, the greatest number of points
Pitt had given up this season was 92
in a loss at then-No. 7 Duke. Notre
Dame came within a 3-point shot of
tying the most points scored against
Pitt in history, but Providence put
up 123 points against the Panthers
in 1989.

Heading into the game, Berenato
stressed that Pitt’s focus needed to
be on more than just junior guard
Skylar Diggins, Notre Dame’s sec-
ond-leading scorer with 15.9 points
per game.

She was right.

A total of eight Notre Dame play-

ers‘ reached double ﬁgures, led by

ﬁi’th—year senior Devereaux Peters
who led all scorers with 20 points.
She averages 11.2 points per game.

‘_‘I’m not really big into getting
a bunch of points,” Devereaux said
in a post-game press conference.
“There are plenty of people on the
team who are scorers. When I have
big nights, that’s great, but I don’t
focus onit.”

Natalie Achonwa added 19 points
and seven rebounds.

Notre Dame’s head coach Muf-
fet McGraw said in a post-game
press conference that she was most
pleased with her team’s balanced
scoring attack, particularly of the
bench.

“I felt that everyone that came
in contributed in some way, and
we kept the intensity up,” she said.
“Sometimes when you get a big
lead,.you sometimes worry about
that. We’ve had games where we’ve
struggled to score late in the game.
We kept the focus on defense too.”

Diggins said inapost-game press
conference that it’s important for
Notre Dame to keep its focus at a
high level.

“We take it one opponent at a
time and just try to get better each
day in practice,” she said. “With-
out having practice players, we’ve
been going at each other, which I
think is good for us. It helps us to
go up against some of the best play-
ers in the country [who are] on our
team.”

Redshirt sophomore Ashlee

.»

Anderson led Pitt with 14 points
and was the only Panther to reach
double ﬁgures.

The Irish shot 64.9 percent from
the ﬁeld —— the best shooting per-

centage for a Pitt opponent since

2004.

“Notre Dame played in the pur-
est form,” Berenato said. “They
didn’t play above the rim, but they
really executed the way offenses are
supposed to be run. They nailed
their threes and they were on from
the start. When you shoot over 60
percent for the game, it’s pretty im-
pressive.”

For the ﬁrst time this season, Pitt
failed to convert a 3—pointer, shoot-
ing 0-10 from beyond the arc. The
Panthers shot 35.6 percent from the
ﬁeld for the game.

Notre Dame held Pitt to fewer
than 10 points until 8:11 to go in the
ﬁrst half and led 54-19 at the half.

Pitt’s trouble maintaining pos-
session reached new heights against
the Irish, as the Panthers eclipsed
their previous season high of 25
turnovers, committing 26.

With the loss, Pitt is winless
through the ﬁrst six games of con-
ference play for the ﬁrst time under
Berenato.

The Panthers will continue their
quest for their ﬁrst Big East win
when the West Virginia Mountain-
eers cometo the Petersen Events
Center on Saturday for the Backyard
Brawl. Tipoff is at 2 p.m.

TRIETLEY

FROM PAGE 8

Lamar Patterson’s 38 percent.

“Wow. Has Gibbs really been that
bad this year?” the man said.

Ashton Gibbs hasn’t changed as
a player since last year, but the team
around him has. V\f1th no offensive
threat to complement Gibbs, defens-
es can swarm him — or whatever
bee metaphor you want to use. With
power forward Nasir Robinson strug-
gling to ﬁnish baskets and Woodall
in a checkered button-up, the fresh-
man Johnson of all people is the de
facto No. 2 scorer —— except he’s also
a catch—and—shoot player.

When Johnson kept Pitt close to
the Orange in the second halfwith a
deep 3-pointer as the shot clock ex-
pired, the 24,826 people in the Car-
rier Dome went silent — except for
my Syracuse ﬁiend.

“Where’cl this kid come from?”
he said.

“Yeah, he does that a lot. Good
defensively, too. He was a little un-
derplayed as a recruit I think,” I told
him.

Johnson’s range has been a bright
spot this season. The sans-Birch re-
cruiting class — Malcolm Gilbert,

John Johnson and Durand Johnson

,— earns high marks. The previous

trio ofWright, Moore and Isaiah Epps
 not so much. “

Pitt closed the gap to four points,
53-49, with 8:39 left in the half, but
Krisjoseph and Dion Waiters hit back-
to-back 3-pointers to extend the lead
to 10 and end the Panthers’ charge.

Joseph’s was an open look, awell—

drawn play by Syracuse head coach

Jim Boeheim out of a media timeout.

Johnson had a hand in Waiters’ face,
but the 6-foot-4 Waiters rose and hit
regardless.

“Now that’s what I’m talking

about!” the man said.

It’s too common a scene. A 6—foot—
4 shooter rising over one of Pitt’s di-
minutive guards, be itjohnson (listed
at 6-foot-1), Gibbs (6-foot—2) orWood—

all (5-foot-11). The Panthers are worst ,. _

in the conference in 3-point shooting
defense — opponents hit 34.8 per-
cent of their shots from behind the
arc. Shooters just elevate over Pitt;

It happens down low, too. How
many alley-oops did the Orange have
Monday? You don’t see “size disad-
vantage” in a sentence about Pitt too
often, but here it is.

With less than a minute to play,
my newfound Syracuse friend and I
both reached under the bleachers to

grab our coats. “Good game on both 

ends tonight. You could’ve had it if
you hit a couple more of those free
throws,” he said.

Height, size, injuries, transfers
 them’s the breaks. But free throws
are fundamental, and poor shoot-
ing from the line is endemic at Pitt
this year.

It’s like that scene from “Animal
House” when Dean Wormer reads
off the grade—point averages. 
Taylor: 57.1 percent. Talibv Zanna:
55.9. Robinson: 52.3. Epps: 0.0.

He’s 0-for-3.

Pitt has two options: ﬁnish under
the rim despite contact or make them
pay at the line. If the Panthers can’t
do either, a kind—hearted Syracuse fan
in section 315 wants to know, “When
are they ﬁnally going to win?” f-

SWIMMING

FROM PAGE 8

She wrapped up the evening by
picking up the silver in the women’s
400-yard freestyle relay (3:29.74).
Her efforts earned_ her the title of
Pitt Performer of the Meet.

The wins over Richmond and
Villanova were an about—face from
the Panthers’ sluggish meet against
West Virginia last week.

“I think the girls realized they
did not perform as well as they

could have against West Virginia,” _

Knoles said. “They wanted to make
a statement at our own pool against
a future ACC team —— against a con-
ference championship team, Rich-
mond —— and our current confer-
ence foe, Villanova.”

While the women cruised to easy
victories in two of their matchups,
the roles were reversed when they
faced powerhouse No. 25 Maryland
(13—1, 3-1 AC).

“It was really good to swim such
a strong team,” Budzis said. “I really
enjoyed racing Maryland. I’m pretty
sad that they’re getting cut. It’s such
a good team — especially the girls ‘-
team. You can see that they won
every single relay.”

Not everyone is convinced the
team will be getting axed before
Pitt makes the dive into the Atlantic
Coast Conference.

“I’m not certain that this will V

be our last meeting,” Knoles said.
“Swimming and diving have done
the best job of all the other sports
in terms of helping the University
of Maryland in ﬁnding alternative

methods to fund their sport. My 5'

feeling is that they’re going to ﬁnd
away to keep swimming and diving
around. They have one of the best
facilities in the country, and they’ve
done a great job raising money in

just two months.” 

After a weeklongbreak, Pitt will
swim next against the University of
Virginia, which is ranked No. 12 in

1 both the men’s and women’s polls.
