If Gov. Tom Corbett gets his Wish,
liquor distribution will be the
business of private. entities — all
in the name of education.
Corbett’s plan is to privatize
the entire state liquor retail and
wholesale system, auctioning
more than 1,200 licenses for
businesses to purchase — mean-
ing wine, beer and spirits could
be sold by grocery stores, beer

distributors and a slew of other ll’

businesses —— with the surplus

of revenue infused intothe state , V’

education system. _ .
Instead of the consumer hop-

’ ping from store to store to pick up

wine, beer and other necessities
foran event, they could-visit one
shop to purchase all of their fer-
mented products. This would ‘in-
clude being able to buy a six-pack
of beer, unlike the purchase of an,-'

entire‘ case under the current plank

Corbett’s plan also would cre-_
ate a Passport for Learning block
grant,which calls for a $1 billion
investment in‘ education, drawn
from the sale of the licenses. ‘

Eric Shirk, deputyadirector, of
communications in the 'governor’s

ernor’s plan to add $90 million to

he was grateful for the ﬂat funding.
“We are here to say thank you,

especially in light of the past few

years,” Louderback said in the meet-

ing. “Maintaining level funding is a‘

goodthing.”

Yet SGB members noted that ﬂat
ﬁmding is positive only because it
means that the University shouldn’t
be receiving less money from the state
than last year. Without an increase in
ﬁmding, however, tuition increases at

Pitt in the next academic year remain ,

likely. But before Corbett armounced
his budget proposal, he said he and
the state—related universities had
reached an agreement: in exchange
for avoidingthe appropriations ax, the

universities will work to keep tuition .

costs “as lowaspossible” for students.

Louderback also spoke at the Leg-
islative Reception in the afternoon,
and urged representatives to take note
ofhow much Pitt needed funding. He
pointed out that the University could
not afford to lose students due to in-
creased tuition costs.

Pitt Chancellor Mark A. Norden—,
berg, who also made the journey and
delivered an address to attendees at
the Capitol Building, echoed Louder-
back’s sentiments.

“It is of utmost importance that
we are here today. Legislators need
to be reminded of the importance of
higher education, and at a rate that
people can afford,” he said. “Today
shows that nothing gets your point
across quite like the human touch.”

Althoughstudents were not ex-
actly speaking out against the pro-
posed budget, they were encouraged
to speak with as many legislators as
possible throughout the day.

Obama
calls for
social
advances  

Pat McAteer
News Editor

President Barack Obama unveiled
an extensive legislative agenda that
included improving the affordabil-
ity of higher education, combating
global warming and tightening gun

control during his fourth State of '

the Union Address Tuesday night.

Capturing much of the progres-
sivism that highlighted his Inaugura-
tion Day speech, Obama celebrated
the economy’s recent improvement,
but also acknowledged the multitude
of challenges still facing the country.

One of the major areas addressed
in Obama’s speech was education,
beginning at the preschool level.
Touting the success of tax credits,
loans and grants in making college
more affordable, Obama said ac-
cess to higher education continues
to increase. 7

But the president also acknowl-
edged that taxpayers couldn’t con-
tinue subsidizing college students’
education, and that colleges needed
to strive to make tuition more af-
fordable.

In response to the continuous
rise in cost, Obama asked Congress
to change the Higher Education Act
to tie federal aid to colleges’ efforts
to keep tuition down. He also an-
nounced that his Cabinet would
release a “college scorecard”‘that

_ students and parents could use to
~ compare prices and value between

different schools.

HARRISBURG

Beecher played a major role in or-
ganizing the event, and worked to
encourage students to attend the
event for weeks prior to Pitt Day in
Harrisburg.

Logistical challenges

Once students reached the Capi-
tol building, they dispersed into pre-
assigned groups based on the order
in which students registered for the
event. SGB members handed out fold-
ers including itineraries, instructions
and information before sending stu-
dents off with their group leaders.

According to Beecher, group lead-
ers were trained to communicate ap-
propriately with legislators in a sepa-
rate training session that took place
Sunday night.

But despite the efforts at organiza-
tion, some students faced logistical
difficulties in having drop—in meet-
ings with legislators early on in the
day. Tuesday happened to be asession
day for legislators, and many were
not in their offices. A fraction of the
students had appointments to meet
and speak to legislators, but a high
number of students were left wan-
dering the labyrinthine hallways of
the Capitol Building, waiting to ﬁnd a
representative who happened to have
the time to talk.

One such student was Nick
Stravinskas, asenior, whowas atIend-
ingthe eventforthe ﬁrsttime. During
the buffet lunch provided by the Uni-
versity, Stravinskas said he felt he was
wasting his time because he had not
yet talked to any legislators and didn’t
really know what to do with himself.

“It was-disorganized to begin
with,” Stravinskas said. ; ‘

He said he received little instruc-
tion in how to go about meeting with
legislators and telling his stories to

representatives. To  it
seemed like those‘ in charge at the
event had just handed out folders
and expected him to know where to
go from there.

Another student who echoed the
frustrations of many legislators’ lack
of availability to meet with students
wasfreshmanjesse McCarthy. While
ta1<mg' “a break underneath the main
rotunda of the Capitol building, he

. voiced his opinions on the day.
‘There weren’t really many oppor-

tunities to see some representatives
here today as many aren’t in the oﬂice
or are doingsomething else. It’s alittle
disappointing I won’t be able to see
some ofthem today,” McCarthy said.

SGB members alsohad their fair
share of difﬁculty in meeting with
legislators early on in the day. Board
member Dave Rosenthal said he had

intended to see Rep. Dan Truitt, R- ’

Chester, but that 'I‘ruitt had not been in
ofﬁce when he tried to meet with him.

“Legislators aren’t really meeting
with people,” Rosenthal said, noting
that students looking for legislators
also didn’t really knowwhere to go in
the building, and a lot of people were
getting lost. '

Accordingto Beecher, legislators’ .

schedules change without warning,
and therewas no guarantee that each
would be able to meet with a student.

Beyond theloakland Campus

While students from the Oakland
campus tried to catch legislators or
wait for the appointments, students
from the Pitt Greensburg campus
found more success. Thirty students
came from Greensburg to talk to four
representatives from the Greensburg
area. According to Pitt—Greensburg
student Briana Kissell, each student
had an appointmentwith at least two
of the four representatives assigned
to him or her. ‘

Representative George Dunbar,
R-Westmoreland, met with a group of
Greensburg students and expressed
great support for funding in higher
education. Happy that no ﬁuthercuts
had been made this year, Dunbar said
that he was slightly biased when it
came to higher education because
he had kids in college. However, he

seemed to thinkthatﬂatfundingwas

the best the government could offer
the University.

“I certainly wouldn’t expect in-
creases,” Dunbar said. ‘ 

Several ‘students in attendence
were not Pennsylvania residents,
but still felt their voice and opinion
mattered to the Pittsburgh area. One
of those students, freshman Biology
majorAnisaMughalisfrom Salt Lake
City, but still felt she needed to be at
Pitt Day.

“I justfeelthatunderstanding and
advocatingfor issues inthe presentis
important, because it directly affects
the future,” Mughal said.

As the day wore on, however, leg— '

islators made their way back to their
offices and students had more success
talking to their representatives inthe
aftemoon hours.

McCarthy, initially discouraged,
also had some good news on the day,
as he did eventually get to meet with
his district’s senator, Daylin Leach,
D—Montgomery.

“He was great to speak with and
reaiﬁrmed me that hewas committed
to continually ﬁmding Pitt,” he said.

4 Board member Sarah Winston,
who spent the day dropping off fold-

_ ers with information and statistics

about Pitt DayinHarrisburg at legisla-
tors offices and hoped to catch repre-
sentatives who were free to talk while
making her rounds, ﬁnally met with
Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, D-Erie, and four
other legislators, whose names she
couldn’t recall.

According to Winston, Bizzarro
was very much in support of educa-
tion, and she was excited because he
was the ﬁrst representative she had
run into. Winston said that itwas nice
to be able to speak with an elected
ofﬁcial .

Board members John Cordier,
Rosenthaland Louderbackhitastreak
in the afternoon and met with four
representatives within an hour. One,
Rep. Ronald Waters, D-Delaware,
spoke to the members about how
much the statefocused on higher
education as compared with other
areas in the government.

“As of now, you see that we that

we are spending more money in cor-

rections than in higher education,”

Rep. Waters said. “The priorities aren’t

because he got to see just how much

tional efforts —— outlined in hisrecently
proposed budget, the block grant will act
as another successful way to “look out for
the future of the people here.”

The block grant, he said, will provide
educators with a level of ﬂexibility while
also focusing the money in four areas —
school safety, early education, STEM pro-
grams and individualized learning.

While he acknowledged the limit that a
one-time infusion would inherently hold,
Shirk said the governor’s plan will beneﬁt
schools across the state.

“It is a one—time infusion of cash, but
that is what we would be getting for selling
the system and we are letting the school
districts know this would be one time,”
Shirk said. “We are saying, ‘don’t use this
for salaries, don’t work this permanently
into your budget,’ but that doesn’t mean
that it would not have a positive effect for
education.” g

States can moderate alcoholic beverage
sales through a variety of ways. Generally,
there are two models: control, under which
the state is responsible for some or all facets
of sale; and license, which enables private
organizers to handle sales. Thirty-two states
are license states, while 16 others operate
under the control model. Pennsylvania and
Utah are the only states that operate under
a third, monopolistic model, in which the
state government holds a strong public role
in regulating all aspects of distribution.

Corbett commissioned a Liquor Privati-
zation Analysis report, published in October
2011, outlining the current state system.

Currently, Pennsylvania has 613 state-
run retail stores, operated entirely by al-
most 5,700 full- and part-time state employ-
ees. In 2009-2010, $1.5 billion in revenue
was generated through sales and licenses.
In the 2012-2013 ﬁscal year, the net ﬁscal
impact of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board was estimated to be $408 million.

If the plan is put into place, the Liquor
Control Board will likely consist of 290
equivalent full—time positions, with ap-
proximately 3,200 positions eliminated,
according to the report.

While the plan would result in job loss by

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

the end of the four-year privatization pro-
cess, Shirk said the loss would be offset by a
net growth of in—state businesses looking to
hire and tax credits provided to businesses
who hire displaced workers.

“I disagree it will cut jobs. Sure, people
who work in Pa. liquor stores now would
lose their jobs eventually, but you have to
remember that there are 600 state liquor
stores and this auctions off 1,200 licenses,”
Shirk said. “If these businesses grow, it will
double the amount of opportunities.”

But questions still arise over the poten-
tial consequences that moving toward less-
regulated liquor sales will have on public
safety.

Chief among them is the concern of mi-
nors acheiving greater access to alcohol.

The Keystone Research Center, a non-
proﬁt group that performs original studies
addressing economic and civic problems,
published a study in May 2012 focusing on
alcohol—related deaths and state control.

“All else equal, a heavy control state with
the characteristics of Pennsylvania sees 58
fewer adult deaths each year from alcohol-
related traﬂic accidents than a comparable
state that has no such control,” the study
stated. ’

The researchers deﬁned heavy control
states as regulating the retail sale of at least
two types of alcohol, and controlling at least
one type at the wholesale level.

The researchers, Jue Wang, Mark Price
and Stephen Herzenberg, also reported that
there was no difference in fatality among
youth aged 15 to 19.

Corbett has worked to address the fears
that some have voiced about underage
drinking and greater intoxication by mak-
ing some adjustments in his plan. Fines for
selling to underage and intoxicated indi-
viduals willincrease, and the state police
and Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement

‘ will receive a 22 percent funding boost. The

Department of Health will also receive some
help through a 75 percent increase in fund-
ing toward alcoholism treatment and pre-
vention.

For Shirk, privatization will not only
benefit students, but also another key por-
tion of -the Pennsylvanian general public
— the consumers.

“People have wanted this for a long
time,” ‘Shirk said. “We are one of two states
that don’t have a privatized system, so that’s
48 other states who are doing this. And
people talk to us all of the time — they
want to be able to buy a bottle of wine at
the grocery store. Consumer convenience
is a big beneﬁt.”

But State Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Mont-
gomery, a member of the State House’s Li-

ADDRESS

citizens must have access to the education and
training that today’s jobs require,” Obama said.

As the deliverer of the Republican’s oﬁicial
response to Obama’s address, Florida Sen.
Marco Rubio said he supported federal ﬁnan-
cial—aid programs, but felt reforms needed to
be made to the program.

“It’s not just about spending more money,

on these programs — it’s also about strength-
ening and modernizing them,” Rubio said.
Citing “Superstorm” Sandy and other re-
cent extreme weather events, Obama called
for a “bipartisan and market—based” solution
to rising global temperatures. He also vowed

‘ "1 my i-. *
.2214:25¢m::«:m:...n

are l=/l!:fli!,m<:

to use executive action if Congress couldn’t
come to a compromise on the issue.

But, in what was perhaps the most antici-
pated portion of his speech, Obama called
for new gun—control measures in front of a
Congress sharply divided over the issue.

As he stood in front of an audience that
included some of the families of the Sandy
Hook Elementary School shootings in New-
town, Conn., Obama called for new universal
background checks on gun purchasers and a
ban on high—capacity magazines. He added
that many of the reforms have been embraced
by ardent supporters of the Bill of Rights’ Sec-
ond Amendment.

“These proposals deserve a vote. Because

~ in the two months since Newtown, more than

a thousand birthdays, graduations and anni-

versaries have been stolen from our lives by a
bullet from a gun,” Obama said.

Although he said measures are required to
reduce violent crimes in the country, Rubio
said “unconstitutionally undermining the Sec-
ond Amendment rights of law—abiding Ameri-
cans is not the way to do it.”

Before closing his speech, Obama spoke at
length about the shared sacriﬁce of Americans.
Citing Wisconsin police officer Brian Murphy,
who he said arrived at a shooting at a Shikh
temple last year and fought to save the lives of
temple attendees and fellow ofﬁcers, Obama
called for an embrace of an American identity.

“We are citizens. It’s a word that doesn’t
just describe our nationality or legal status.
It describes the way we’re made. It describes
what we believe,” he said. I

quor Control Committee, said these same
consumers could pay more if Corbett’s plan
passes through the state legislature.

“For the perspective of consumers 
people are under the false impression that
if we privatize the system, prices for wine
and spirits will go down.”

This was true in the state of Washington.
When the state switched to privatization, it
issued an initiative that resulted in a price
increase of around 20 percent.

Additionally, Boyle said, the privatiza-
tion of the state—run liquor stores would
signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of govern-
ment revenue after proﬁting $1 billion from
the initial sale of liquor licenses.

“Tom Corbett is so conservative that he
seems to think privatizing is always the solu-
tion,” Boyle said.

Ultimately, Shirk said, as the governor
makes plans to work with the legislature over
the next few months, he is optimistic about
the plan that has been suggested in the past,
but never passed. Corbett, he said, doesn’t
think the stat‘e should act as a marketer, but
merely a regulatory and enforcement body.

“This is an issue that has been in the pub-
lic eye for years. Gov. [Dick] Thornburgh
tried it in the ’70s, but the public wants it
now,” he said. “Plus, this is a very important
issue for the governor, and he will work hard
for it.” I

to hang around ‘sports bars and
develop a passable knowledge of

and past histories of the teams. As the game
went on, other people were less surprised
by my remarks, and it felt as ‘if I was be—
ing accepted as a person who understood
football. I had become accepted as a “le-
gitimate” sports fan.

This necessity to gain legitimacy is mis-
guided, and it is only perpetuated by blogs
and articles such as the New York Rangers’
‘‘Girl’s Guide to Watching Hockey.” The
article, published on the Rangers’ website,
gives ﬁve “rules” for women to follow when
watching a hockey game with their hus-
bands or boyfriends. In describing these
“rules,’.’ the author implies that women do
not know the rules of the game and that

Thinking that women need to be ‘_‘edu-

gendered and stereotypical patterns.

ﬁnally, women have broken through.

The over—se‘xualized image of women in

By publishing such an article, the Rangers
add to the sentiment that women do not
have an inclination to learn about sports
out of pure interest in the game. As such,
it becomes necessary for women to dem-
onstrate their comprehension before being
recognized as a true fan.

I have been lucky when it comes to be— '

My brother invites me to participate in his
otherwise all-male fantasy football league

that I have had to work hard to develop a
reputation as a woman whoknows about

WBASEBALL SEASON PREVIEW

Panthers look to take next step as program in 2013

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

' O'I:‘fhe Pitt baseball team enters the 2013 sea-

son looking to improve upon its record of
28-28 from last season and hoping to rise
out of the middle of the Big East pack before
transitioning into the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence next season. The Panthers open the
new campaign ranked No. 7 out of 11 teams
C1!!! the Big East preseason poll.

Playing well this season will be particu—_
larly important for head coach Joejordano
after the Panthers ﬁnished last season with a
10-17 conference record. With six returning
starters and two of Pitt’s weekend-rotation

starting pitchers on the roster, the 2013
season will play a monumental role in Pitt’s
move to the ACC in 2014. »

Jordano remains conﬁdent that his team
will be able to compete in the ACC, but he

~»-After finishing last seaon with a 28-28 record, the Pitt baseball t

n

admits the move will be a challenge.
“There is no ‘easing into the ACC,”’
Jordano said. “It is arguably the toughest

conference in the country, and every team ‘

competing in baseball is wired to compete
for a national championship. We have be-
gun the process to put our program "into a
competitive place as we move forward. We
really like our 2013 recruiting class and have
some verbal [commitments] for the 2014
class. We will need to continue this trend
to sustain continued success.”

The recruiting classjordano and his staff
put together this past offseason will not only
help to keep the team progressing, but it
will also offset the losses of key contribu-
tors such as graduated ﬁrst baseman Rick

Devereaux -— last season’s home-run leader "

with eight bombs _— and graduated starting
pitcher Matt Iannazzo, Pitt basebal1’s all-
time career wins leader with 28.

f‘We have a few freshmen that are playing
solid baseball. It is our goal to make sure’
they are put in positions to be successful.
I like where they are at at this stage,” Jor-
dano said. y_

According to Perfectgameorg, Pitt’s re-
cruiting class ranks No. 40 in the nation,
just one spot behind the recruiting class of
2012 national champion Arizona.

“We hope that all of the players we
brought in this year will impact our pro-
gram,” Jordano said. “We will shortly see
what the level of that impact will be.”

Pitt’s recruiting class will join a team that
came very close to enjoying a great deal of
success last season, but could not manage to
win close games —— 18 of Pitt’s losses in 2012
came by two runs or fewer, and 10 losses
saw only a one—run difference between Pitt
and its opponent.

As a result, consistency will be crucial to

 

 

earn hopes to win more close games‘ and move up the Big East standings this season before the programf;
begins competing in the powerful Atlantic Coast Conference next year.The Panthers begin the next season at Wichita State this weekend. Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer ,

Pitt’s improvement in 20.13. V

“We need to close games. We lost 18
games by two runs -or less last season. With
many of those we were leading late in the
game. Consistency in our approach every
day [is our goal],”Jordano said.

To replace the production of Iannazzo, ju-
nior starters Ethan Mildren and Matt Woth-
erspoon will be called upon for greater duty.

Mildren, a local product of Laurel High-
lands High School, threw 95.6 innings last
season and ﬁnished with a 6-6 record and
a respectable 3.76 earned-run average. In
those innings, Mildren struck out 72 batters
and walked only 17. ,

Mildren should expect to see the focus of
the starting rotation shifted onto him, es-
pecially after his innings~pitched total from
last season represented the ﬁfth-highest

  Decision to remove wrestling

from Olympics makes no sense

eginning in the 2020 Summer Olympics, American wrestlers won’t be celebrating
winning medals anymore after the I00 voted to drop the sport. MCT Campus

Donnie Tasser

Staff Writer
The International Olympic Committee
made a baffling decision on Tuesday
when it voted the sport of wrestling out
of its “core” group of sports for the 2020
Summer Olympics..Considering wrestling
is one of the original Olympic sports in
both senses — written records detail its
inclusion in the Olympics held in ancient
Greece and it has been included in every
modern Olympic Games since they re-
sumed in 1896 — I ﬁnd this decision to
be a travesty.

Let me first disclose my bias: I am a
member of the University of Pittsburgh’s
wrestling team, so naturally, this decision
hits close to home. While the Olympics

do not appear to be in my future, it was
one of only two potential paths the best
collegiate wrestlers could choose if they
wanted to continue to compete — the
other option being mixed martial arts.
But I cannotbegin‘ to comprehend why
wrestlinglwas axed “over several other
very questionable and, in my mind, less
deserving athletic events.

This is not the first time I have been
stunned by the IOC’s decision—making

than worthy of inclusion in, the world’s

most prestigious athletic showcase. Mean-

total in Pitt history. Essentially, Mildren
will be ]ordano’s workhorse ongthe mound.

Also on the mound, Wotherspoon-ended
2012 with 86 strikeouts in 91.3 innings and
a 4-4 record after posting a 5.03 ERA.

In the outﬁeld, Pitt will return three key
members in junior Casey Roche, sophomore
Boo Vasquez and junior Stephen Vranka.
Vasquez and Roche both posted batting aver-
ages above .300 last season, and Vranka will

set the table for his fellow outﬁelders after ‘

leading the Panthers with 22 runs scored in
2012 Big East play.

Roche believes that the Panthers cer- '

tainly have the ability to shock ‘the college
baseball scene this season- ‘

“We don’t_ read into the preseason polls,”
he said in an interview. “We know what kind

of team we are, and we’re going to surprise

a lot of people.” _ _

' ' In the inﬁeld, Pitt’s left side will return
experienced seniors Sam Parente and Evan
Oswald. Oswald ended 2012 witha .391 on-
base percentage, and Parente hit .302 while
driving in 26 runs fornthe Panthers.

But on, the right side there is more un~
certainty, with multiple players battling for
playing time at second base and a potential
for a righty-lefty platoon at ﬁrst base in the
form of redshirt junior Steven Shelinskyjr.

this weekend.
The Panthers face a challenging begin-

. ning series on the road against Wichita State.

The Shockers enter the season ranked No.
32 in the Collegiate Baseball Preseason Top
40 Poll. '

“It’s avery aggressive opening weekend,” . P

Jordano said. “We’ve always tried to schedule
according to the opportunities we have, but
also to be certain that we’re in situations that
may help put us in position for potential
NCAA regional consideration at the end of
the season. It will be a great challenge for us.”

Pitt will also play No. 34.Kent State in its
nonconference schedule before the Panthers

_ start Big East playon March 22 at St._]ohn’s.

Overall,_]ordano expects his team to com-
pete well in every single game, regardless
of the opposition — Big East conference
member or not. ’

‘fMy vision is, and always will be, to play
hard from the ﬁrst pitch to the last of the
season,”Jordano said. “We need to play clean
baseball, and our starters need to pitch as
deep into the game as possible. I like our
chances at the end of the game.”

His vision includes a stipulation for im-

provement, in a similar fashion to the Pitt

men’s basketball team’s ascent this season.
“We will be ready. We want to be playing

1 our best baseball at the end of the season,”

Jordano said.‘ ﬂ

while, sports such as equestrian, sailing,
badminton, table tennis, golf and canoe-
ing all remain Olympic sports.

According to an ESPN article, wres— '

tling was voted out of a ﬁnal group that
included modern pentathlon, taekwondo
and ﬁeld hockey in a vote of “39 catego-
ries including television ratings, ticket
sales, anti-doping policy and global
participation and popularity. With no
ofﬁcial rankings or recommendations
contained in the report, the ﬁnal decision
by the 15-member board was also subject
to political, emotional and sentimental
factors.” .

These political, emotional and senti-
mental factors were no doubt in play when
the decision was made to keep modern
pentathlon — -the event that was previ-
ously thought to be next on the chopping
block — over wrestling. Modern pen-
tathlon, which features archery, fenc-
ing, swimming, horse riding, running and

‘shooting, has been criticized for being

outdated and having a small world follow-
ing. Butjuan Antonio Samaranch]r., the
vice’ president of the International Mod-
ern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) — modern
pe'ntathlon’s governing body —,was one of
the 15 voting members on the IOC board.
The IOC board has faced criticism for

corruption and taking bribes in the past, .

notably duringjuan Antonio Samaranch
Sr.’s time as IOC president.

While “a relatively_unfounded accusa— .

tion of corruption” might be a bit much to
describe this shocking move by‘ the IOC, I
and many others across the globe fail to
grasp the logic behind the move.
Modern pentathlon is modern only in
name; the event was created to simulate
the skills of a cavalry ofﬁcer. The reported
worldwide participation of modern pen-
tathlon — around 5,000 participants —
is nearly doubled by the participation of
wrestling in the state of Pennsylvania
alone (9,900). ' s A ‘
Let that sink in for a second.
Wrestling is also much more popular
worldwide; it is an extremely popular
sport in the Eastern Bloc countries, Russia
and the Middle East, and it completely
dwarfs the following of a majority of
sports remaining on the Olympic bill.
UIPM president .K1aus Schormann
claimed in an Associated Press article that
modern pentathlon had tradition on its
side, completely ignoring that wrestling
predates shooting pistols and fencing by

' nearly 2,000 years. A _
Wrestling also arguably boasts the big-

gest upset in Summer Olympics. history
— American Rulon Gardner upset Russian
Alexander Karelin in the Greco-Roman

5 . heavyweight ﬁnals during the 2000 Olym-

pics in Athens. Karelin was a three~time
gold medalist, had been undefeated for 13
years in a row, had not given up. a point

— in six years and had such colorful nick-

names as “The Russian Bear’? and “The

Experiment.” Gardner was a pudgy, one-
time NCAA All-American from Nebraska.
Gardner beat Karelin.

Can anyone remember a moment like

;'this in modern pentathlon?

“I think this is a really stupid decision,”
Olympic historian David Wallechinsky
said in a New York Times article. “It was
in the ancient Olympics. It hasbeen in the
modern Olympics since 1896. In London,
29 different countries won medals. This
is a popular sport.” A

Wrestling’s tradition, intense competi-
tion and high participation levels across
the globe should have been enough to
keep it safe — at least while sports such
as “modern” pentathlon are around. m
