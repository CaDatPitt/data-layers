'Recolonization' keeps sorority out of rush activities

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

(‘is Members of Pitt’s chapter of

the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority
are angry about a decision by

_ their national council to totally

recolonize their organization,
which will keep them from
participating in the recruitment
process of this week’s fall rush.

“Without provocation, [the
national council] sent letters to
current active sisters and made it
quite clear that we were no longer
wanted,” said Julie Ayoob, a T ri
Sigma member.

Members of the sorority claim
that they sent numerous letters to
the council inquiring about the
sorority taking partin Pitt’s rush
events as well as other “Greek”

events held throughout the year.
“We wrote to the national
president in Virginia and were
bluntly told ‘No, thank you,’ “
Ayoob said.

According to Ayoob, the only
information that the members
received was that there were no
longer any sisters in the sorority
and all those who had been active
were now regarded as alumni.

“They don’t want anything from
the [previous] sisters in the way
of any kind of involvement” said
Ayoob. “There are, very hard
feelings between everyone
involved.”

Bridget Geurnsey, assistant
director of student activities at
Pitt, claims that the recolonization
is due mainly to declining
membership among the sorority.

“lThe sorority] didn’t feel
competitive with everyone else,”
said Guernsey. “They most
definitely felt that they had to
become larger.”

But Ayoob disagrees, saying
that compared to other Greek
groups here at Pitt, their group
has been considered small, but
they have had no recent problems
with membership. “As a matter of
fact, we were larger than we had
been for a while,” said Ayoob..

Maureen Morgan, national
Sigma Sigma Sigma membership
division vice president, says that
the previous members of the Tri
Sigmas will be considered alumni-
and will not be forgotten about.
“They’re still full members, with
all the rights and privileges,” she
said.

“A lot of women want to be in
a group that is the same size as all
of the others. When a group gets
smaller, feelings about that group
tend to become negative,” added
Morgan. “We have worked with
the Pitt chapter on membership,
as well as other problems that
they were having.”

Morgan added that plans for an
open house are underway, where
a recolonization team from the
National Council will visit Pitt
and will hold question—and—
answer sessions in order to raise
interest and help boost the
number of new recruits.
Following these sessions,
interviews with potential T ri
Sigma members will be held,
which, according to Morgan, is
the typical process for a

recolonization.
“We want to strengthen the
group as a whole,” said Morgan.

The national council of the T ri
Sigmas have planned a rush
period which will be separate
from Pitt's formal rush and will
take place from Oct. 2 to Oct. 6.

Currently, the ﬂoor occupied
in Amos Hall by the Tri Sigma
sorority is being used to house
freshman women.

Ayoob says that although they
have received no information or
help of any kind from the
nationals, she is not putting down
the “Greek life.”

“I think that it can be a very
worthwhile experience, if an
individual wants it to be,” she

said. “I just made a bad decision .

[choosing this sororityl.”

The next time‘ you get the
late night munchies for “O”
fries, try eating a quarter of a

Q stick of butter instead.

That’s approximately how
much cholesterol is found in a
small order of fries, according
to Patti Verdi, R.D., the
nutritionist at Forbes Health
Center. And that doesn’t even
include the cheese.

“Students are no different
from ordinary people,” said
Verdi, “and people don’t want
it to change their eating habits.”

zlk.

Health reported that 180 mg/dl
of cholesterol in the blood is
desirable for adults under 30.
When Pitt offered a free
cholesterol screening last year,
170 students participated. A
significant number of students
who picked up their results
suffered from high cholesterol
levels.
“I was shocked,” said Verdi,
“but the results of the test lean
_ toward students who knewthey
had a cholesterol [problem],

The National Institute of

and were taking advantage of
the free screening.”

Cholesterol comes only from
animal foods such as dairy and
meat products. There are two
types of cholesterol, low density
lipoproteins (LDL) and high
density lipoproteins (HDL). LDI..s
are harmful lipoproteins because
they deposit cholesterol in cells.
HDLs are beneficial because they
carry cholesterol from the cells to
the liver for removal from the
bloodstream.

LDL levels can be increased by
age, genetics, stress, smoking,
obesity, diet and medication. Yet
people can have higher levels of
HDLs to balance out the LDL

levels. The younger a person is,

the less cholesterol he should
have in his body.

Stress in a Type-A personality
can raise a student’s cholesterol
level high enough to warrant a

change in lifestyle and diet. Verdi .

said students also have high
cholesterol level because they
don’t eat regular meals and they
start snacking. Verdi suggests that
students cut out fried foods,
doughnuts,’ pastries and other
baked goods, limit egg
consumption, and be wary of
foods from vending machines

A beer a day can be healthy, as Pitt sophomore Publio Briones seems to already know.

because students don’t know
what potato chips are fried in.
“Good snacks include pizza,
peanuts, fruit and popcorn.
Substitute frozen yogurt for ice
cream and read the ingredients
on everything you eat,” she said.
Verdi also said to “watch the
advertising on packages that claim

Cholesterol may be at obleamong collegestudents

to be ‘cholesterol free’ ‘or ‘salt
free.’ Many of the products have
always been free of cholesterol
and fat. Advertisers are trying to
sell [products which didn’t have

cholesterol] to begin with. There ‘

is a lot of misinformation out
there.”
The misinformation is also

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

prevalent in many popular
magazines. “A lot of these
magazines take research and
blow it out of proportion.” said
Verdi. “They end up scaring
people.”

This is true in the case of

City police continue to investigate Schenley Park murder

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

1:’, Pittsbur.gh police continued
investigating the homicide of a Pittsburgh-
area man found beaten to death in

Ichenley Park early Sundaymorning.
The body of 37-year-old David
Piergalski was found in the woods near
Pocusset Street in Schenley Park, around
7E§.m. on Sunday, by a man walking his

dog, as reported by The Pittsburgh Press.
Schenley Park is less than one mile from
Pitt campus.

Police say that the Carrick man was last
seen at the Norreh Bar on Herron Avenue
in Polish Hill, a gay after-hours club.

“We are investigating it, and we don’t
have any particular suspects at this time,”
said Mayer DeRoy, assistant chief of
detectives. “We’re just tracing [Piergalski’s]
steps forward from the time he left Norreh

with another person, which we believe
to be between 1:30 and 2 in the morning.”
Deroy said police do know the identity
of the person who left the bar with
Piergalski, but are making no speculations
about his involvement.
‘ “We'll interview him  along with a
number of [other] people to try and piece
the facts together.”
An autopsy report revealed blunt force
trauma to the head and neck as the cause

 

   A     

 

       

of death. Police have not yet identified or
found a murder weapon and say his body
was probably moved after the murder.

Piergalski’s car was found by police on
Prospect Street, in a part of the park often
referred to as “wedding circle." Police
told the Press that the spot is known as a
meeting place for homosexuals.

The jewelry Piergalski was wearing
Saturday night, gold chains and a ring,

were still on the body, police said.

  Aiding the fight for democracy...
" Pitt organization raises over $1 0, 000 to assist Chinese

By Shawn Mcclearn
For The Pitt News

Since the June massacre of
thousands of Chinese protesters
in Beijing, Chinese nationals at

’  the University of Pittsburgh,



n

A.)

along with their brethren
throughout the world, have been
involved in the raising of funds
to aid victims of that massacre.

, Over $10,000 has been raised

by the Chinese Students and
Scholars Friendship Association,
according to Bing Yu, president
of the organization. He added
that the fund started in mid-May
was originally intended to aid
the democratization movement
in China. After the massacre,
however, the money raised was
earmarked for the relief of the
victims and their families.

, Bing said that the main effort

was being focused on the
continued raising of funds and
coordination efforts with other
fund-raising bodies, because of
the extreme difficulty of getting

. money to .Cl1ina. Larry Chang,

the association’s vice president
said, “We are trying very hard to
get the money into China, but
we have to be very careful

because the government of"

China is watching all incoming

mail very closely, and we want
to make [sure] the money gets to
families of the victims.”

The university has aided the
nationals’ fund-raising efforts by
connecting them with Brother’s
Brother, a 30-year-old
Pittsburgh—based charity. Other
methods of fund raising have
included the distribution of ﬂiers,
mail campaigns, and
appearances at local churches.

In addition, a seminar called,

“Chinese Crisis Continues,” is '

being held today from 4:30 p.m.
until 6 p.m. in the Skibo Wherrett
room at Carnegie Mellon. The
presentation includes student
and faculty speakers, and
provides time for audience
participation. The seminar is
sponsored by the students of
the Chinese graduate student
organization of CMU and Pitt.

Oil ér wildlife a badlmix

Pollution, the wasting away of the ozone layer and the
ubiquitous toxic waste dumping sites are enough to keep
environmentalists busy, even without the accidental oil
spills that occur with unsettling frequency.

Recently, Exxon spent $1 billion trying to clean up its
mistake — a spill of less oil than Americans consume in
one day. Although it wasn't even enough oil to cause an
inconvenience for most Americans, it had a tremendously

K} detrimental effect on the wildlife that inhabited the area
now covered by thick, greasy oil.

Federal wildlife biologists asked Exxon to extend its
self~imposed cleanup schedule past the Sept. 15 pullout
date, in an attempt to save what is left of the wildlife in
Alaska. More animals died in this oil spill than in any other

. around the globe.

I Already,’ approximately -34,000 animals in the area have
been killed, with 400,000 other creatures in danger of
losing their lives. It may seem unimportant that so many
animals have died; after all, it doesn’t really affect our own
species — right?

Wrong. This summer, salmon ﬁshermen were not able
to make use of their usual fishing grounds to take
advantage of what was supposed to be a record salmon

Qrun.

Exxon feels that the affected beaches are now “environ-
mentally stabilized.” Just what does that mean? Appar-
ently it means that it is stable to have 50 miles of beach
covered with muck that is, in some cases, up to three feet
deep. It is stable to have tens of thousands of dead animals
littering the beaches. It is stable to have seven million
gallons of crude oil remaining in the area. 4 , ‘

According to Steve Provant, an Alaskan environmental .
official, “This term "environmentally stabilized’ is an
Exxon term, and as far as we’re concerned it’s meaning-
less.” V ,

,3 However, Exxon officials have no plans to clean up over
the long Alaskan winter, they will soon call the clean-up
operation to a halt even though waiting until April will
jeopardize the safety of the wildlife.

Maybe it isn’t all that bad that Exxon is pulling out. Some
of the fishermen in the area, who have tried all summer
to keep their fish hatcheries free from contamination, are
glad to see the cleanup crew leave. They feel that they
would have been better_off without a cleanup, that there
really isn’t a way to clean up a mess like the one in Alaska.

“Perhaps Exxon was motivated more by an understand-
able concern for their public relations than a sincere
concern for nature.

Regardless of whether or not it is possible to clean up
oil spills, one solution to this problem is obvious. Do not
allow oil spills to occur in the future —— at least make them
gguch less common. More stringent legislature is needed

 to ensure that companies are not taking unnecessary risks

with the only environment we have.

Pitt... sports, academics and pizza

Huddled at the local hangout
with some friends on a balmy
Florida afternoon, I made my
official decision to attend the
University of Pittsburgh.

When I made my announce-
ment, I was in good company:
one friend was off to Yale, an-
other to Columbia, two off to
Penn and another to Williams
College. My announcement sud-
denly made me feel as though I
had assumed the figurative ‘role
of a mutt at the Westminster

Kennel C1ub’s dog show. “Have

you ruled out Penn State?” some-
one asked. “Michael, if that’s what
you really want to do, it’s a good
choice.” Right.

The lukewarm reception led

me to the conclusion that among

upper egalitarian collegiates, Pitt
is hardly considered an academic
force to be reckoned with —— or
even acknowledged. Perhaps the
root of the problem was best
pointed out .in Yale’s college
guide. “Pitt,” the book asserted,
“suffers from a 200-year-old image
problem.” Wow! In an age where
some political analysts have
contributed the Democrat’s three-
election deﬁcit to poor dress, it’s
scary to think what an image
problem can do to a school like
Pitt -— where getting in. isn’t as
tough as the cafeteria’s “steak
special.”

To erase Pitt’s second-rate
reputation, this writer offers two
suggestions, both of which origi-
nate from the observation that
the university community is par-
tially to blame for the image
crisis. The first suggestion is in-
spired by a piece of mail that Pitt
sent to me. While most of the
college pamphlets I received
featured ivy-covered walls and
green lawns lined with brick
buildings; Pitt took a more mod-
est approach. The first piece of
mail they sent me proudly dis-
played —— you guessed it —- a
pepperoni pizza. While some
schools went as far as importing

 

snow for publicity photos, it
seems as though Pitt walked over
to the pizza dive across from my
dorm with a camera and asked
Sal to hold up his creation. Al-
though the pizza did look deli-
cious, it hardly succeeded in
creating an image of academic
clout. Perhaps a more sophisti-
cated approach would lure more
applicants and dispel any mis-
conceptions of Pitt as a second-
rate school.

The second suggestion calls
for a change in attitude. When-
ever I introduced myself as being
from Miami, I can always be
expected to be asked “The Ques-
tion. ” “What are you doing here!?”
It seems that a lot of people
around here act as though Pitt
should be spelled with an A-R-M
in front of it (arm-pitt). The an-
swer I give to those who find
themselves in awe over my deci-
sion is simple. “I came to Pitt
because I love the city of Pitts-
burgh, my family has a tradition
of Pitt alumni and it’s a great
school.”

What — A great school?

Whenever I go over the rea-
sons that Pitt is an excellent
school, I always come across a
little like Shirley MacLaine re-
ceiving her Oscar. “It really is a
good school,” I seem to be saying
in disbelief. For one of the oldest
universities in America, with a
rich past of achievement" and
outstanding credentials’ in the
present, it should hardly come as
a forced revelation that ours is
nothing less than one of the fin-
est schools in the country.

Who did the world look to for
a polio vaccine? Who did NASA
look to when our space program
was in serious need of revitaliza-
tion? Who does the world look to
for the finest medical care avail-
able in the country (perhaps the
world) for transplant patients?
How many schools can offer a
College of Arts and Sciences with
more programs rated among the
top in America? Not many.

What about our philosophy
department? With internationally
recognized faculty, (some hav-
ing held the oflice of president of
the American Philosophical As-

sociation) ours is arguably the
best anywhere. Then there's Pitt’s
Honors College —-'- one of the
best with its acclaimed and one-
of-a-kind Undergraduate Review.

As far as our campus, we can
claim one of the most advanced
computerized communication
systems anywhere. Architectur-
ally, Pitt’s Cathedral of Learning
is both the tallest educational and
Gothic building in the country --
it’s simply beautiful. The Nation-
ality Rooms are also not to be

taken for granted, nor is Heinz ‘

Chapel, nor the Stephen Foster
Memorial. '
Sports, you ask? To cover Pitt’s

‘sports program — one of the

most notable in collegiate histqry
— you would have to readgéa

. book, which just happens to be ’

in the bookstore. In fact, you
could also read a book com-
memorating Pitt’s bicentennial.
Watch out though - it’s bigger
than my art history text. ‘

This school year, the Pitt com-
munity ought to do its part to
remind the academic community
what a fine institution this is. Our
alma matter is shared with some
of the world’s most important
scholars and artists (like Leonard
Baker, Gene Kelly, and Ernest
Boyer); it has been a workplace
to some of this decade’s most
prolif_ic.scholars; and it is a school
to some~of’t',he future’s leaders in
a multitude of fields. Pitt is, after
all, on a short list of schools
mentioned in a book called The
Public Ibys. We don’t deserve the
title “second choice -- but “first
rate." We aren’t a university “park”
—. but a university -— and a good
one at that. Pitt’s admissions may
accept more students than some
of our upper egalitarian peers,
but those who can climb to the
top here can surely compete with
the very best of them.

In retrospect, perhaps the “pizza
pamphlet" does have some merit
in defining the character of the
school. If you have a healthy
appetite for the offerings of an
outstanding university, dig in -
there's plenty here.

BC's offense no match for Panthers‘ ‘two’ defenses

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

“It’s near the end of the first
quarter and Pitt holds a slim 3-
0 lead. Boston College comes
out for its third offensive
possession of the game. The
Eagle offense looks across the
line of scrimmage and sees all
new faces. 1

Pitt has its entire second- team
defense in.

The first-team defense shut
down the Eagles on their first
two possessions, limiting them
to about 20 yards.

BC’s offense must be thinking,
“OK, the second-team D. They
can’t be as big and talented as
those other guys. Let's get
something going now.”

On the third play of the drive,
Jeff Estersbats a pass attempt in
the air, and Tom Sims comes up
with the interception, giving Pitt
good field position.

Surprising for defensive
substitutes? .

Not Pitt’s. Actually, most of
Pitt’s second-team defense could
probably start in a lot of college
football programs. .

“Our whole idea is to play two
defenses. On this day I think
that may have been the
difference. It kept us fresh for
the fourth quarter. Our second
team did well, and there's a lot
of young guys in there.”

The defensive line is the strong
1“ point in Pitt’s substitute defense.
Keith Hamilton, a 6-foot-7, 275-

’ pound freshman, will probably

be starting on the defensive line
at -least by next year. Sims had
78 tackles as the starting
defensive tackle for Pitt last year.
Esters had three unassisted
tackles against BC.

The linebackers don't rank far

.valuable expe-rience. Dave
‘Coleman; Marcus Washington

Walker was supposed to start at
middle linebacker for Pitt this
year before Craig Gob, who has
eight tackles, got the job. Prentiss
Wright is so talented that he is
considered a starter by most of
the coaching staff. Mike Boykin,
who recovered a fumble in the
Panthers’ first game, is the other
linebacker. , ’ /
The secondary has a host of
young players picking up

and Barry Threats make up this
tandem. Robert Bradley, a
captain, adds some experienc
to the group. '

This talented group was a big
part of the Panthers’ 29-10 victory
in Boston on Saturday for two
main reasons. '

The first reason is obvious:
they played great football. They
consistently shut down the BC
offensive attack and they came
up with two turnovers.

The second reason is that they
gave the Pitt coaching staff
confidence to rest the starting"
defense. Rest was very important
for this game. It was 84 degrees
at game time, but the hot Boston
sun, the Alumni Stadium artificial
turf and the extra weight added
by the pads must have made the
heat almost unbearable.

Starting defensive lineman
Tony Siragusa quipped that it
was like playing in Miami.

Starters or substitutes, the Pitt
defense pretty much dominated
the Boston College game.

Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt,
who threw for over 200 yards,
said having such a dominant
defense gives the offense that
much more confidence.

position. After an interception,

Alonzo Hampton (3) chipped in with two interceptions in Pitt's victory against the Boston

A score of 700 on the SAT is all that
stands in the way of Pitt pulling off one of its
biggest recruiting coups in history.

Shannon Davis, rated as the top
scholastic female player in Pennsylvania and
one of the best in the country last year, has given
Pitt’s women's head coach Kirk Bruce a verbal
commitment to play for him next season should
she meet the proper academic requirements.

Not since Charles Smith arrived in 1984
has the Panther roundball program landed a
bigger fish in the recruiting waters.

“She's a great one, there's no doubt
about that,” Bruce said of the 6-foot-2 forward
from Sacred Heart High School.

Indeed, to say that Davis dominated the
opposition on the high school level would be a
massive understatement. She followed up a
junior year in which she averaged 23 points with
a 22.4 ppg, and 18 rebounds-per-contest senior
season. She shot a gaudy 64 percent from the
field.

Davis was named to__ USA Today First
Team her senior year and was a Parade All-

choose a collegeto attend, but her failure to
meet the mandatory minimum score on the SAT
placed her in the infamous Proposition 48
position.

Apparently, when Virginia began
planning out her life, Davis decided to see what
Pitt had to offer. She is currently taking part-time
classes at the university while priming herself for
that SAT examination. Davis could not be reached
for comment.

“Virginia’s entrance requirements
allowed no one with less than a 700 [to be
admittedl,” Lady Panther assistant coach Kim
Basick said. “They had plans for her to go to
some prep school, and she didn't want to do
that.”

“She must meet the SAT requirements
by July 1,” Carol Sprague, Pitt’s assistant athletic
director in charge of women's sports, said.
“She’s paying for everything herself right now.

“If she would get the score, then she
would have four years of eligibility left. If she
were to enroll right now full-time, then she
would only have three left.”

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Pitt’s women's volleyball team
traveled to Illinois last weekend
for the Illini Classic to put its
undefeated record on the line
against the No. 4-ranked Fighting
Illini on their home court.

Adding to Pitt’s difficulties was
the fact that Illinois has several
physical All-American candidates,
and one of Pitt’s top hitters, Julie
Sheils, was recovering from a
midweek illness.

The Lady Panthers lost the
match (7-15, 4-15, 11-15), but Pitt
head coach Sue Woodstra was
able to extract a silver lining from
the cloud of defeat.

They did beat Memphis State in
the first round (15-13, 15-3, 11-

D

Belgian
By Mike Ramptax

The Pitt soccer team is counting
on youthful talent to improve
itself from last year’s 6-8-1 record,
but 27-year-old Marc Mostinckx
of Brussles, Belgium, will be
serving as the Panther mentor for
the second straight season.

With the addition of Mostinckx
last season, the Panthers and
Coachjoe Luxbacher moved to a
more patient, pass—and-cut
offense instead of the typical
collegiate kick-and-run game.

The transition created a
multitude of scoring
opportunities; however, Pitt had
trouble capitalizing. This season,
Mostinckx believes the Panthers
must create, and most important,
maintain their style of play while
avoiding the hectic kick-and-run
game played by most of their
opponents.

“The [talent] gap among teams
in Division I soccer is not that
great, but I think a lot of coaches
have lost sight of what the game
is all about,” Mostinckx said.

“It’s fine to hack down a guy
and take the ball off him, but then
players are just kicking the ball
40 yards. Anyone can do that.

“The next thing on [a player's] -
mind after he makes the tackle
should be ‘Hey, I’ve got to get a
good pass off here!’ And the
good teams. think that way, and
that’s the main difference between
the average teams and the good
teams in this division. We're trying
to think like the good teams.”

Mostinckx played soccer in
Europe and South America since
age 7 before coming over to the
United States in his mid-20s. He

Both Devins and LoPrinzi showed
signs of nervousness before the
opening of the 1989 campaign-,
but appear ready for battle on the
courts.

“I’m- not exactly sure
what it's going to be like,” Devins
said.” I’ll be playing against a lot
of more experienced players.

“Things have not gone
quite as we had expected,”
LoPrinzi stated. “We’ve both had
injuries for the first time in our
lives, for one thing.”

Juniors Lisa Kinney and
Gwen McIntyre will open the
year as the No. 2 and 4 singles
players. ’ Chris Orie and Cassie
Mattioli will close out the
individual competition.

The two freshmen will
team up as the top doubles’
combination, while Kinney-
Mclntyre and Orie—Mattioli will
get together to make up the other

Women's tennis looks to its freshmen

With only six players
competing in nine different I’
matches, one can imagine that
depth will be a problem this year
for Pitt.

That enigma can easily
be attributed to the fact that the
No. 1, 3 and 4 singles performers
of last season will not play for Pitt
this season. Tracy Feltingoff,
Sandy Hunt and Jill Cohen all
decided to skip the season for
academic/purposes.

“Depth is going to hurt
us,” Dieffenbach agreed. “We’re
still waiting to see if we have a
couple of other people available.

“But we can definitely
be competitive this year. Our
goals are to keep the academics
up, have a winning record, and
get out of last place in the Big
East.”

Defense

Continued from page 6
everybody is pumped up and

« ready to go. I think it makes the

‘-4

offense realize, ‘Hey, the defense,
gave us the ball, the opportunity,
and the offense has to go down
and score," said Van Pelt

Last year when Pitt played at -

BC, the Panthers jumped out to
a quick 14-0 lead in the first
quarter. BC closed the gap to

Soccer

14-10 by halftime, but Pitt rolled
on to take a 31-19 lead late in the
game. BC scored on two big
plays late and won the game 34-
31.

Pitt's defense was determined
not to let the same thing happen
this year.

“It seemed like every time BC
would get something going,
someone on defense would step
up and make the big play,” said

cornerback Alonzo Hampton.
“That's what makes us such a
good defense. We always pull
together when we need to.”
Pitt's coaches are not sure if
they'll continue to use two
entirely different defenses
throughout the year. The only
position in question as to
whether they are deep enough
is secondary, where Hampton
will be used on both teams.

Continued from page 7
talent as freshmen J.R. Perdue,
Scott Alexander, and junior
college transfer Roberto Croce,
the Panthers have a new offensive
look to be loaded with talent.
However, the new talent has its
price. .

“I think the team this season is
more talented than last year, but
we just don’t have the depth,”
Mostinckx said.

._ “We've got 14 or 15 solid
players, but we’don’t know who
we can really count on yet.”

Indeed, the Panther soccer team
lineup is much like the way Jim
Leyland manages the Pirates.

The Panthers seem to have a

problem ﬁtting their talent into 8

the appropriate positions. Last
year, players were shufﬂed from
one side of the ﬁeld to the other,
and from offense to defense.
Different players started the game
each Contest. and players were
moved from position to position

from game to game.
. This strategy was merely

Luxbacher’s never—ending attempt‘

to score goals, much as Leland’s
lineup shufﬂes are intended to
create some runs for an ailing
Pirate attack.

“I don't think we’re going to
have that big of a scoring problem
this year; we’ve got the guys who
can put the ball in the net,” said
Mostinckx. ‘

“I think our biggest problem
will be, and I saw this in the first
half against Slippery Rock [on
Sept. 6], is getting into a running
match with other teams.
Everybody is a good athlete at
this level, and everyone can run

season,” Mostinckx said.

Pitt will be playing a “double
stopper” system this season, with
three midfielders up front. It is
known as a 5-2-3 offense, and it’s
designed to provide a solid
defense and an explosive offense.

“This game is all about decision
making. [Our] players want to
make fast decisions, and they

haye to ‘ make fast decisions,

because they're under ‘high
pressure. .

“But our decisions are not clean.
A pass is too far or too short, but
at least we’ve got the idea in
mind. Plus, on this [astro] turf, it’s
not easy,” Mostinckx said.

with decent speed. The big factor .

is skill.

“Everybody can make a good
tackle, but you still have to be
able to construct and think and
make that good pass. If we play
tough,lyet  constructive and
smart. I think we'll go far this

Soccer on artiﬁcial turf is a
highly paced game. The ball
travels much faster on ground
passes, bounces much higher on
punts or air passes, and it is
.extremely difficult to regain
possession of a miscue. '

percentage (kills minus errors
divided by total attempts) against
the Lady Panthers, over 200
percentage points higher than
Woodstra would like to see
against her team.

“We're a pretty good defensive
team, and they still hit .474 against
us; that says it all,” said Woodstra.

Pitt hit a .248 percentage against
Illinois, actually 64 points higher
than they did against Memphis
State, whom Pitt held to a .055
clip.

Things aren’t going to get much
easier for the Lady Panthers this

weekend, when they travel to
South Bend for the Notre Dame
Invitational Tournament. There
they will play against Paciﬁc,-
Western Michigan, as wellas the
hosting Fightin’ Irish.

All three teams are ranked in
the top 20 in the latest NCAA poll,
and with Pitt being absent from
the list, Pitt will have to play
virtually error-free.

“I'm not really sure how,we'll
do, but with all three teams
ranked, we deﬁnitely have a
challenge ahead of us,” said
Woodstra.

Davis

Continued from page 6

If she can, get that score,
the Pitt coaching staff is convinced
that the SATs will be the biggest
challenge that Davis will have to
face at Oakland. According to
Basick, there are not very many
things that Davis cannot do on
the basketball court.

“She’s an A1l+American,"

Basick said. “She's an athlete with
God-given talents.

“Plus, her mental attitude,
is such that she's prepared to
make herself better and improve.
At this stage, if you can get a kid
with that type of talent to display
that type of attitude, you've got
yourself a basketball player.”
