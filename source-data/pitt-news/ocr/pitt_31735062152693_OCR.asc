‘SCHOOL OF CHILDHOOD
OFFERS NEW COURSES

Miss Mary G.‘ Waite, Director of
the School of Childhood, University
of Pittsburgh, has opened new educa-
tional classes during the past week,
with about twenty pupils. Tuition is
free, but the number has been limited
in order to give the pupils proper indi—
vidual attention. This is a demonstra-
tion school to show what can be done
by adapting the best features of all
the modern methods. The model play-
room is equipped with kindergarten
and montessori materials, and many
educational home toys. Children who
attend are from 4 to 7 years old.
Nearly every part of the city will be
represented in the enrollment. Pupils
will come from theEast-end,i_Schen-
ley-farms, Oakland, Wilkinsburg and
South-side. The youngsters, in addi-
tion_to the indoor work, will make ex-
cursions to greenhouses,-the park and
the markets. A little lunch will be
served in the middle of the forenoon
and the children will assist in the
marketing for this school lunch.

Thelihysical care of the children is
well considered. Each child W111 be
th01'0U8'h1Y examined before being al-
lowed to enter the School, and all will
be carefully watched, both as to their
PIIYSCI3-1 Well being‘ and their mental
progress.

_ Turn Discomforts of. Travel to
 Good Account ‘

I.
In

Traveling on the B. & O. and the
discomforts arising therefrom were the
only drawbacks to a very_ enjoyable
and successful trip during the Christ-
mas vacation, when the Musical clubs
sojourned in Cumberland, Md., and
Someset, Pa.

Thirty-ﬁve men, including Prof. L.
J '. Heath, left the B. & O.‘ depot on the
morning of Dec. 30, for Cumberland.
Before long, the train became far be-
hind Schedule time. which factso in-
spired the crowd that it composed a
parody on the B.‘ & 0. to the tune of
“Tipperary.” ‘ This original composi-
tion was "used as an encore inthe
concerts: and that it represented the
consensus of opinion was demonstra-
ted by the wild applause it received.

In Cumberland, the concert was held
under the auspices of the Y. M. C.
A. and proved a hugh succss. The
clubs received hearty applause after
the presentation of each number and
the desire of the audience for more
could hardly be satisﬁed. The Stay in
that. town was also made a social suc-
cess through the personal efforts of

W. H. Baxley, the congenial secretary.

Special features of the concert were:
J. A. Thompson, who thrilled his lis-
teners with his readings; R. H. Kirk,
whose solos delighted everybody; L
G. Garrett, who simply made the banjo
talk; the quartette, with the aid of
Geisel’s cane; and “The Ragged
Eight.” P

In Speaking of the concert, the
Cumberland. 'News' said: “Each mem-
ber of the club is a talented musician
and the combination was one not to be
easily excelled.”

The next afternoon, the clubs left
Cumberland for Somerset, but before
that destination was reached, many
waits and delays were experienced.
Almost two hours were spent in Rock-
wood while waiting for the train to
Somerset. The only diversions were
promenading the‘ main boulevard and
watching the baggage depot.

Quite a sigh of relief arose as the
train left for Somerset; but it was

9

only the calm before the Storm. After
traveling for ﬁve minutes, the pro--
gress was halted. Upon investigation,
it was learned that a freight train
was _wreckd, ‘and as the slogan was
“Freight First” instead of “Safety
First,” it was quite late when the
train arrived at Somerset. -

But althese troubles were forgotten
when the boys began to enjoy the
warm hospitality of “Charlie” Hentz
at the Belmont Hotel. Following din-
ner,« he presented each one with a
rose, and with this additional adorn-
ment, the clubs preceded to the Opera
House where they acquitted them-
selves as nobly as before. v

But the work was not over. It
was New Year’S Eve. The boys re-
turned to the hotel where they en-
tertained the inhabitants until the
wee small hours of the morning. They
sang and played as they never did be-
fore, and not being content with the
conﬁnes of the building, they gathered
around the Community Christmas
Tree and Sang _‘‘Hail to Pitt” and gave
the good, old Pitt yells. The new year
still found the boys reveling to the
delight of the Somersetonians.
one remarked: “There never was such
a rousing time in Somerset before.”

The next morning the clubs re-
turned to Pittsburgh thoroughly re-
paid for the inroads the trip had
made on the vacation. I

. Tuesday evening rehearsals were
resumed as usual, and as there is new
music, every member is urged to come
out. The next concert is Jan. 22. New
candidates can also try out for the
Home concert and Easter trip.

Considering the time lost during
the holidays, much has been accom-
plished -by the members of the Owl
board. The editors have outlined their
plans for the year book and the mana-
gers have already secured a good start
on the collection of the Junior assess-
ments and subscriptions from the
other classes. - "

Arrangements have been completed
with one of the city photographers to
make the pictures of the Juniors.
When the assessment is paid, each
Junior will be given a card which will
entitle the possessor to have hsi pic-
ture take nat this studio.

The manager has Supplied the de-
partment editors with cards upon
which to secure the information about.
each student, which is necessary to
complete a record of the Students in
the annual. When you get your card,
ﬁll it out and return it promptly to
the editor. If you receive no card,
apply to the editor of your depart-
ment for one or your record will not
appear in the book.

-With the Panther furnishing a big
impetus in the work of the miscel-
laneous department, this part of the
publication will be muchlarger than
heretofore, and some surprises are
being prepared.

All who desire copies of the Owl

as the time limit set by, the Advisory
Board is Feb. 1, and no Owl can be
published if the required amount is
not raised. As few, if any, copies will
be published above the number sub-
scribed for, the only way to be sure of
Sceuring a copy is to subscribe now.

 

SECOND ISSUE OF .
PANTHER NEXT WEEK.

With the usual promises of a num-
ber “bigger and better than ever,”
the Panther Board announces the sec-
ond appearance of the beast on the
University campus, the arrival being
scheduled for next Wednesday morn-
ing, Jan. 13th.

' When requested for a forecast of
the coming issue, Editor Hoehl polite-
ly declined, saying that “the truth will
all come out next Wednesday.” What
this means, THE WEEKLY has no
means of knowing, of course, but
listen to what Mr. Hoehl said, in ad-
dition: ~

“We shall adhere,” said he, “to our
previously declared policy of provid-
ing an exposure every issue. The
purpose of the‘Panther is, not, of
course, essentially serious; and it is
still farther from our purpose to in-
dulge in useless criticism. We feel,
however, that many things around the
University are worthy of discussion,

heard. There will be nothing of the
shrinking violet about the Panther-
if you will pardon this mixing meta-
phor. If you want to know what’s
rotten in Denmark, .doii’t read the
Panther; but we’ll tell you all about
the University.”

 

 

, The Y. W. C. A. will'serve ‘a Dairy

‘Musical Comedy to, Run Three
Days-—-Principal Members of
Cast Announced. ‘

The cast for the Cap and Gown pro-
duction “The Maxixe Girl,” has been
deﬁnitely determined by the execu-
tive committee of that organization.
The management through the efforts

Jr., who is temporary president, has
secured February 25, 26 and 27 at the

tation of the work. I

The procuring of the Schenley thea-
ter for the presenting of -the play
seems to meet with universal approval
on the part of the officers and mem-
bers of the club. It is argued that

comes at the time of thecelebration
of the Unviersity’s 128th anniversary,

University will be here to add brill--V
iance to the occasion. -
Mr. McCormick, speaking of the

Gown club indeed was very fortunate
to secure the dates of February 25,
26 and 27, in the Schenley theater.
We had almost given up_the hope of
obtaining it because of the extremely

ing that playhouse, but we all rejoiced
,when we learned that the Cap and
Gown club could meet the terms of
the theater management.

“I think the result of this engage-
ment will give the Cap and Gown
club larger audiences than it has had
heretfore. The location is the best.
"It is situated so near the University

that thousands will attend the show.
The theatre is‘ newand beautiful, nad

our show. I am delighted that we
shall present “The Maxixe Girl” in
the Schenley. A . '

“Then, too, it will be anniversary
time, and naturally there will be
many people attending the University
functions. The production will cer-
.tainly furnish an excellent addition to
the program of that time. I feel that
this will be the greatest of the Cap
and Gown club’s numerous successes.”

The work ‘of rehearsing the cast
and chorus is progressing. G. N.

ing care of the cast and Gus A. Sch-‘
nable the chorus. The club meets on
Saturday afternoon in 107 Thaw hall,
while the caste has already been
chosen, those in charge said yesterday
that there is room for several good’
singers and dancers in the chorus, and
desired that a number of candidates
should present themselves before the
ﬁnal choice is made. -

cers of the club includes:
drews as Dolores, the Spanish adven-
turess; A. G. Johnston as Helen, the
cqnsul’s daughter; A. Wolk, the, Con-.
sul; E. H. Landis as the manager of
the Movie Film Co.; C. H. Corbus, the

Thompson, the colored porter; .L.- L.

Two ‘years ago‘ there was .-a great
deal of ” discussion. in regard to the
adoption’ of the honor system in"Ithe
' University, but nothing deﬁnite was
done. For a time there'Awas a. great
amount of interest "shown, but later

‘the whole thing was allowed to. die

A I notice in the Alumni Columns of

the i graduates to express their. opin-
ion concerning. the adoption of the one

ics at the University. A‘- z A‘ . ' g
A I might say that I know of no other
single. thing which would so advance
the _' standing of" the University.
throughout‘ Athe ‘whole Acollege- world.-
Qnly the universities of highest stand-
ing ‘can adopt such a rule with, suc-
cess and I believe there is no doubt.
that-Pitt‘Ais_ at present in that posi-
tion. As an educational institution and
as an exponent of clean. athletics, ‘.I;
ﬁnd that the :University_is_ es~tabl.ish-IA

of ‘A‘THE. PITT WEEKALY?’fand,A I pre-
sume, -was read, by all members of
Council. _I - ‘ A ‘ A
At the Conference were ,.Arepresen_-.
tatives from some 50 or 60 colleges
and ‘universities of the country and
the discussions and papers. presented.
were interesting-and‘, proﬁ-table. The.
three main points brou_ght out were :—-
A—-the Alumni "publication;' .B——theA
class secretary system; CA-—Alu‘mni
representation on Board of Trustees,
or aAdministi'a'tiye body -of the‘ insti-
tution. . ‘~ " A " "- A
The question of‘ alumni publication
was discussed-3 from all ‘ang1es,—.—ﬁ-
nancing, how to make interesting, how
to getV;tlAie paper to alumni, etc. The
.Ge_neralA Secretary‘ secured many good
pointers. Late'r‘inA this report, he will
deal with question of giving Pitt
alumni p_ublica'tion. .. A .
The thing that impressed the Gener-
.aAl -Secretary most was the class life
secretary .schem_es> in effect at -Yale,
Cornell and -similar -institutions,. ‘and
he has already decided on the plan‘ for‘,
our “University. This will be outlined-
Alaterin the report. - . . -
- We: have secured our almuni repre-
-sentative on the Board of Trustees
and, it might be stated,‘ are -‘a step
ahead of themajority of‘ institutions
in this respect. Few of those repre-
sented ' at ‘the. Columbia conference
have such representatives, ‘although
all are working for them. V .  -
-As was stated in THE PITT
WEEKLY rep  c--‘we-» are convinced
that the University of -Pittsburgh is»
not a. “back number” as’ regardes al-
umni affairs, and we feel .that our
-graduates are just‘ as loyal to ‘Alma
Mater and will,VVbe just as responsive
as those of, any Iinstitution when the
are once i“stirred up.” V _ . . - 
The treatment accorded the visit».
Aing secretaries by the authorities -of
-Columbia and Yale was most‘ courte-
ous and everyone returned home sat-'
isﬁed that the three days‘ conference
was proﬁatble, indeed. . . . 
The place of the néxtconference is
on the Paciﬁc Coast, with Leland'IS.tan-‘
ford and University of California "as
hosts. It is likely wecan secure an
alumm,1S who is in that part of; -the
country -to represent us, as: some -of
the Western colleges? did at the Col-
umbia conference,-as with theamount
I’ work to be done here, it ‘is doubt-
ful if the General Secretary could
spare the A time for a " trip of, this
length. - - ' - — ’

2. A_l-umni Publication.
- The question; of‘ alumni publication
has been referred to. We are con-
vinced that the Alumni Columns in
THE PITT WEEKLY are serving all
needs at -present as all paid up mem-
bers of the Association are getting
thepaper and, we believe, are reading
It. VThe_-Afac_t thatrthe‘ paper contains
every news item of interest around the
University-—,alumni, and other-wjse_‘..A_
and that it reaches them EVERY
WEEK makes it an especially valu-
able medium of .communieation_ with

alumni publication; it .would' not be
better than; a quarterly. or, at best, ‘a
monthly, at ﬁrst-and the news that
would be printed in it would, as a

of the'University of Pittsburgh, /at-'
tended the annual meeting of the N; C.

A. A. which washeld in Chicago. 

Miller reports a -very, interesting

meeting and a. number of exceedingly

important measures thatwere brought

before that body. . .

7 Among ‘the surprises sprung’. was
the policy advocated by Prof; Chas.
Savage, of ‘Oberlin, which is generally
known as the Andover plan. The new
scheme has been injoperation at- An-
dover for some years, and provides
for the elimination of all gate recipts

his contention by Prof. Lillard, of An-

all ‘colleg_e foot ball~‘had outgrown its-.
educational advantage, and had be-‘
come more or less professional. in all
colleges; . _. . V

At the last meeting of Council, th
«question of having some deﬁnite pro‘-

of that specialzcommittee and the ne-
cessity of this was emphasized. It
will be ourlaimlto «make such arrange-
ments this June, arranging a program
which will make it interesting and
proﬁtable . for the graduates who
“come back” and attend. the _ Com-
mehcement affairs. .
Starting jmmediately, we will work
.on the. classes which are scheduled for
reunions this Comn’rencement.and will
‘try to. get an enthusiastic worker in
each class to. stir thingsup. This
worker, if he showsgthe proper spirit,
we willwlater try to have chosen Life
Secretary.’ With ten‘ classes having
reunions‘ ‘each year, under the plan

 we have adopted, we will soon‘ have

the’ Life Secretary matter in shape.

' At these‘ class reunions, we will pro-
vide some feature such as a tree plant-
ing, baseball game, or something of
that sortwand will furnish, guides
(students, or“‘members of Councilfwho
can spare the .:time) .who will show
the visitors over the University cam-
pus, buildings,‘ etc. As .this develops

-soon start to look forward to Com-
mencement time and. their reunion.
; _. We‘ will try ‘to have the University
‘set aside a room in Thaw.-or‘State hall
for each class to have headquarters
and will also have the fraternities co-.
operate‘ to entertain them. Whether
it will be best.,to have this Commence-
menti day_ ‘Q11 a special “Alumni
Day” remains_to.'be.decided. Later on
we must havean, “Alumni.Day”,but it
is a, question whether we have de-

important date, was covered on Syra-
cuse’s schedule zby. a-contract with
‘Brown. . Arrangmeents. may yet be
made for a game in .1916, but a contest
next 'fall seems out of the question.
In. the meantime,’ contracts have
-been signed “'with._State, ‘W. '& J ., Car-
lisle, Carnegie Tech, Westminster
and Allegheny, the Methodist being
given the date held by Dickinsonlast
season... The otherteams are signed
up for the same Saturdays as last fall.
With the dropping of the Cornell
game, it seems _..-..improbable, that the
»Varsity will plaﬁfo nthe last ’-Septmber
‘Saturday, thus postponing the opening

’ of "the season until October 2nd, when

Westminster. will be "the attraction.
The September, date has never "been
an attractive one, especially as the‘
game must be played at D..C.,& A2.-C..
Park, rather than.‘ at Forbes’ Field.
Then, too, it is possible that the West-
minster battle will have to be staged
in the Wilkinsburg arena, so that it
seems-out of the question to add an-
other -suburban engagement. It is
still within the bounds of possibility
that an out-of-town game will be‘
played. ' Otherwise, thegseason will
probably be formally opened on the
ﬁrst Saturday in October.
