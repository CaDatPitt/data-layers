Europe Helps
Turn Students
From French

The present chaotic state of the
world conditions has had its effect
upon the University’s modern lan-
guage department. _

According to ﬁgures compiled by
Dr. VVhitford H. Shelton, head of
the department, enrollment in Span-
ish classes has risen from the 128
of last year to 217 this year; in
French lasses enrollment has
dropped from 342 to 218; and in
German courses from 398 to. 362.

Ninety-six students are studying
Spanish I this year, while only 53
were in the same course last year.
The Evening division’ also has
shown a rise—from 22 students to
53.’ , p — ~ ‘

' The.advic.e given by Cordell Hull,
sec1l'eLa_ry’of state, in an article in
Good Housekeeping '_magazine, urg-
ii..g young, people to" study Spanish,
is only one: of many such recom-
mendations given by‘ national ﬁg-
ures, .i.nc1uding‘M1“s.., Eleanor ‘R.o.qse-‘
velt, in her daily‘-newspaper column.

A’ strong disap'poin‘tme'nt' in the
fate of'Fra‘nce is, in the opinion of
Dr. -Shelton, a contributing factor
in the enrollment idecline for French
courses. " A

The relatively small decrease in
registration for Germa-ri classes as
compared with French classes, may
be attributed to the fact that Ger-
man is required in many of the
science curricula. Also important
is the fact that the University School
o. Medicine does not require mod-
ern languages as one ofits prere-
C§ulSlI€S, while other medical schools
in the country do. .

Dr.'Sh»elton also stated that a rise
in registration for the new modern
language courses is evident, the
freshman ‘course showing an enroll-
ment of 52 students‘ in.its first year
at ~Pitt..- ~ Modern languages. 61, now
in its fourth year at the University,

Texas, and yet never met until
they enrolled in the Research Bu-

Winogradof comes from San An-

Stockdale, Tex., his home. Both
graduated fromthe School of Busi-
ness Administration ‘at the Univer-
sity of Texas in Austin.

The recommendation of the same
man, their professor of marketing
at the University of Texas, W. A.
Nielander, led them to choose the
Research Bureau at Pitt.

._ Both men think highly of the
university and the Bureau. Wino-
gradof said, “The Research Bureau
in Pittsburgh is one of three schools

“ of retailing, possibly the best, in the

United States, where practical-.. ex-
perience in retailing can be com.-
bined with special studies.”

Surprisingly, the size,,of Cathe-
dral does not bother them. The
University of Texas has a building
of thirty-two stories in which the
members of the administration have
their offices.

Both were much impressed with
the department stores in Pittsburgh,
stating that they are much larger
than any of the stores back home.
Each expects to specialize in mer-
chandising.

Eagle Returns to University Roost

Columbia.

At Gaurentia each man was as-
signed as overseer to gangs of 25
native workmen, much, as Karl de-
scribes it, like a chain gang. Ten
minutes in the 110 degree sunshine
drenched one to the skin, and so
the schedule ran something like
this: work 4 a. m. to 10 a. m.;
siesta until 5 p. m.; and work again
until 8.

The overseers usually were armed
because of occasional native upris-
ings spurred by the all-menacing
South American “foreign element.”
“It was nothing too disturbing,”
Karl explained, “—just a, couple of
shootings.”

For diversion they hunted jaguar
and wild pigs, rode ‘horseback
through’ the jungles, and swam.

Clocks were set by the dry season
rains which came exactly at two
every afternoon and lasted about
20 minutes.

Then, just two weeks before
school was to start and conscription
became inevitable, the Gulf people
made a decision. All men liable to
conscription in the next two years
were to be sent home; the rest could
stay. Their contracts were bought
back, they were shipped by plane
to Rio de Janiero, and from there
to St. Petersburg, Fla., by Clipper.

Instead of being discouraged, the
adventuring Pitt junior was pleased.

“The glamour was beginning to
wear off,” he grinned, “and the
work was actually work.” In his
opinion, South America is the last

E

frontier and the place of oppor-
tunity for the adventurous-minded.

For the present, he intends to re-
main in school, but after that, he’s
off to the Dutch East Indies (if
they’re still on the map) to work
on an air freight line managed by
his closest friend, Lt. Seymour Pond,
formerly of the French Foreign le-
gion.

Karl does these things we only
allow ourselves to think about be-

cause he has to. His family" was
one of the early settler groups in
Kentucky and still own the River-

side farms, breeders of the famous

racer, Bourbon King. He still has
a slight Southern drawl, slurred
with a touch of Spanish from all,
those weeks in Colombia. '

A \Velcome and lllglufled
Addition; to Rushing
We think this neW"lega.lized pre-rushing program sponsored by
Interfraternity council under the label “Fraternity Freshman Pro-
gram” is a darn good idea. That is, once you strip away the
persiﬂage about it being a device to welcome. all freshman students
to the University, as some people would '1iai?;;=““‘3%""csu believe, and con-
sider it in its proper light, that ofbeing a ‘welcome and digniﬁed
addition to the fraternity rushing period.
= It isn’t exactly an extension of the six action-packed days
and nights of rival back slapping and hand shaking waged by the
individual houses. The innovation is a sales promotion campaign
designed to sell the entire fraternity program to what columnist
Hamilton calls “the green unplucked.” All of which is good.

 ‘We have always felt that there should be something else be-_
sides rush week to stimulate students into investing four years in
fraternity life. '

The editor of the Dartmouth, student publication of the school
ofkthe same name, has an interesting commentary on this subject".

 He says: _ '

'f“‘ll‘raternity_rushing combines the worst features of an At-
lantic City convention and a small-town church bazaar. It is
a- ,wonder that anybody even" joins a fraternity after ‘going-
throiigli the rushing period. Knowing a fraternity only during
r11shi.ng is like knowing Philadelphia only during the American
+Legion’s annual parade. ‘ You would think someone would ﬁnd

quiet, reﬁned, orderly, friendly way" of inviting likeable fel-

;l_ows to join ith._eirclubs, but everyone only goes on ‘complaining

and thinking of new ways to increase the hectic-ratio.”

_ “Anyone who joins a fraternity after heiihas been rushed,

‘illicit-boxed, fed ‘beer and cider and doughnuts and warmed over

,"gu_ff, given the cold shoulder and the sizzling hand clasp, eyed,
:tried on for size, mauled,-discussed, ping pongetlto death, andv

‘ex-hausted from answering‘ the same sillyﬁ-questions, must know

something. He must knowthat this vi/eel: of authorized non-

. sense is not the end of fraternity life.” i ,  I

 VVe guess that most of what our" New Hampshire colleague
says is true. But the question then is, if not rush‘ week, ‘what other
means are you going to employ. At least that’s the one_Joe Roberts
ofthe Phi Gam house and Delt Dave _Buente_put to us when we
presented them with our criticism. V . _ V _

,_,_ ,They say that the Pittsystem of fraternity pledging, with its
delayed campaigning and its silence week,;__is, one of the best in the
country; This we don ‘t know; but we’ll take, the fratei-Anvity men’s
word for it. » » , . ' —

. ’ At any rate, we think that the new wholesale advertising cam-
paign of Pitt fraternities is a good thing. “To hope thatgthe indi-
vidual sponsoring houses remember that the thing they’re selling
this week is the fraternity system as a whole. VVe suggest that they
reserve their knifing of one another ’s houses until next week. It ’s
legal then.

Last Call for Hospitalization

£1-» . .It’s a. plug; the last one necessary, we hope.
_ It concerns the deadline for hospitalization fee payments which
has been set for tomorrow at the Treasurer’s oﬁlce in State hall.

There ’s no use for us repeating the list ofbeneﬁts available
under the group hospitalization program co-sponsored by the Stu-

Pound Deplorcs Law’s M odem
Trend Toward Ahsolutisnt

By Edgar Beigel

“University students must today
decide between legally controlled
government as w_e have knownit in
the past, and accepting the new‘
type of personal absolutism that is
again sweeping Europe,” said Dr.
Roscoe Pound, in an interview cli-
maxing his address last Friday
morning in Stephen Foster Memo-
rial. ‘ 7

America’s outstanding student of
jurisprudence, Dr. Pound observed
that just as man has developed a
control of phenomena inthe phy-
sical world, “so we must decide that
phenomena in the human worldcan
and will also be controlled. In the
legal ﬁeld, the growing phenomenon
of administrative law in the U. S.
foreshadows the coming of govern-
mental control not unlike that con-
trolling Europe today.”
iltefers to Newv Deal‘ ‘ A ' A -

‘Referring speciﬁcally to the New
Deal, Dr. Pound compared it to the
same type of growth that has spread
over the rest of the world during
the past decade. _

“But government through per-
sonal absolutism was not an inevi-
table trend.” Europe has had it
many times in the past. It can be
controlled if the people understand
its dangers, and will that a legally
ordered society should exist,” he
said. .

Earlier Dr. Pound hadspoken on
“The Place of Administration in
the Legal Order” to almost 800 stu-
dents and faculty in the overcrowd-
ed Stephen Foster auditorium.‘ In
the ﬁrst of a series of four addresses
on “Administrative Law” sponsored
by the University‘ School of Law,

Dr. Pound explained the evolution"

of administrative law as it parallel- if
 ed the growth -of social services

performed by national govern-_
ments throughout the world.

Attacks ‘Offhand Judgment’,

With the exclamation, “I deny 

that administrativetlaw is the legal
order,” Dean Pound announced the

theme of his lecture series, ’pre- ,

pared to show how former concepts
of law as “rules of -conduct, a body
of authoritative precepts, ‘a nd
grounds upon which‘ controversies
between men are decided,” how the
‘‘legal order” of private law devel-
oped in England, have been super-
seded by a new type of public law
which government is “subordinating

rather than coordinating its citi-JA-

zens.”
Dr. Pound especially attacked a

Intercollegiate

From the Dartmouth, which re-
views books displayed currently at
the library on that campus

“ ‘Tactics and Technique of In-
fantry’ begins with complete in-
structions on how to kill the enemy
with riﬂe and/or bayonet. ‘The
point of the bayonet,” reads the
text, ‘should be directed against the
oppor-.ent’s throat, especially in
hand-to-hand ﬁghting, so that the
point will enter easily and make a
fatal wound on penetrating a few
inches.”

But t.her«e’s more to soldicring
than killing in style the boys on the
other side. So one of the books on
display, entitled “An Oﬂicer and a
Gentleman.” “Here the recruit is
cautioned against using tooth-
piclszs, vulgar langu_ag.e, and suction
on soup in a spoon . . the sol-
dier is informed: ‘The kniie should
always be held in the right hand
with the handle in the palm and
the ﬁnger along the back of the
blade’ ” . .

This instruction spears only a
dinner for the soldier!

widely held assumption that “what-
ever government ofﬁcials do is law.”

He portrayed such attitudes as lead-
ing to the eventual elimination of
legal concepts entirely, with a sub-
stitution of “offhandcommon sense
judgment” expressed through the
“administrative processes of gov-
ernment.” ’ ‘
Intimating that the present domi-
nant legal philosophy in the U. _S.
was established on false premises,
Dean Pound will clarify his posi-
tion" in lectures next Friday and"
Saturday on “The Future of Ju-

dicial Justice,” “Administrative
Procedure,” and “Substitutes for

Law.”

Coach Olson Builds ’4~0
Hill a_nd Dalers Team
Around Three Men

With its opening meet less than
two weeks away the University of
Pittsburgh cross country squad
strives toward peak condition to
engage the Boilermakers V in the
opener. According to’ coach’; Carl
Olson ﬁfteen candidates daily tour
the Schenley park course in their
initial test.  ' .

The Pitt runners travel to Purdue
university October 12 where a hard
contest is predicted between the
Panthers and the Purdue harriers.
Pitt banks heavily in their ﬁrst tilt
on three veterans from last year’s
competition. These athletes upon
whom so much depends are seniors
Frank McCabe, and Walt Sterner,
co-captains, and junior Bob Gra-
ham.

» Following the meet.with the Pur-
due team, Pitt journeys to the
United States Military Academy
where on October 16 they match
strides with a reportedly strong
Cadet team. From West Point the
Panthers return home to prepare
for the meet with a perennially
dangerous Michigan State outﬁt.
Although the actual date has not
been set, it is believed that No-
vember 2 will be the day named.

j The only home meet of the year
for the Pitt team will be with the
Penn State harriers over the
Schenley course on November 16.
Two days later the Panthers will
pack up- their bags, and troubles if
they have any, and move on to New
Yorkjor the ﬁnal test of the year.

Since the practices are well un-
der way, coaches "Olson and Potts
are ﬁguring on plans forthe frosh
candidates. Thus far this year first
year men have not been called out
for actual practices. Tryouts will
be held. in the _very near future, it
was disclosed ‘f_1_'o_r_ni the coaching

Columbus, Ohi0.—Up to last
Saturday neither Ohio State nor
Pitt had lost an opening day
football game for almost 40
years. In fact, the Buckeyes

last inaugural day defeat came
in....1894, althougli the Panthers
were beaten by Penn State in 1902.

»At approximately 4:30 o’clock
Saturday afternoon, it was evident
to 52,877 football fans seated in
Ohio State stadium that the Pan-
thers’ ﬁne record had been shat-
tered, conclusively shattered. By
4:30 the Big Ten defending cham-
pions had amassed a 30-7 lead, the
worst licking handed a Pitt team
since the-1933 Rose Bowl massacre
in whi-ch Southern California romp-
ed to a 35-0 win.

I For over half the game the Buck-
eyes were meeting the strongest op-
position they had ever encountered
in an opener, but. they blew the lid
off in as wild a third period as the
football-crazy city of Columbus has

seen. During that 15 minute
stretch, the two clubs scored 28
points. '

Through the line the two clubs
were about even, Pitt having a
slight edge in yards gained by rush-
ing, but the explosiveness of the
Buckeye pass attack was too much
for the Pittsburghers. Ohio State
completed seven out of 12 passes
and three of them went for touch-
downs. Every time the Pitt line
stiffened, State cut loose with an
aerial that had “trouble” written
all over it. ’ ‘ A ‘

It was all Pitt the first period, the
Panthers starting one drive on their
40 that ended only when Dick Fish-
er intercepted Eddie Jones’s _pass
on the Ohio seven. Prior to that,
the Panthers had smashed for three
consecutive first downs with George
Kracum, Bob Thurbon,‘ and Jones
alternating. A 50 yard pass, Jones

was walloped 67-0.

Mt. Union

Susquehanna and California Northern tasted 40-0
defeats. Panthers ran away * to a 83-0 win over Waynesburg.

The

Mountaineers of West Virginia returned to their mountain retreats with

a 53-0 shellacking. .

Another great Panther team reared up in 1910.. A new coach, Joseph

Thompson guided a Pitt team
through a perfect season. It was
this team that set up a Gibraltar
defensive. resistance equal to if not
superior to AFordham’s Seven Blocks
of Granite. Not a single team
rossced a Pitt goalline.

Ohio Medical University was
trampled 71-0. A scant 40 points

was the margin between the Panther ‘

squad and Waynesburg. Tech suf-
fered a 35-0 defeat and Pitt downed
West 3}/'irgi.nia 38-0. Two‘ touch-
downs! plus two extra points proved
a comfortable margin jof victory for
Pitt against stubborn. W&J.

A half decade passed. Pop War-
ner, famous grid instructor of the
ﬂeet footed Carlisle Indians, thought
that perhaps Pittsburgh scenery
might be a worth-while change.

What a change it later became!
Under grizzly and likeable Warner,
the Panther went through four sea-
sons undefeated and untied. Dur-
ing this football win streak, the-
mighty Panther roared through to
35 straight victories, one of the
longest strings in modern football.

During those four years, Pitt
amassed a total of 860 points to
their opponents, 65. It was unpre-
cedented in the annals of the pig-
skin. But one team ever threat-
ened to break that glorious string,
a group of hardy Midshipmen from
Annapolis, who ﬁred from the port-
side with a full load. One point

 

‘ snatched another victory for bushy

browed Pop Warner. The score
was 20-19.

A decade had passed before Pitt
once again roared onto the crest of
football greatness. This time, a
lanky Scotchman was at the throttle.
Jock Sutherland perfected four Rose
Bowl teams.

In 1927 Pitt frequented the Bowl
of Roses for the ﬁrst time. They
lost to Stanford 7-6. In 1929, they
returned and once again felt the
anger and dismay of defeat as
Southern California trounced them
soundly 47-14. ' ’ .

Not disheartened by those defeats,
the Panthers returned three years
later with a grumble in their throats
and ﬁre in their eyes. They were
to play Southern California, a de-
spised rival. The Trojans were
again much too much for them.
They won easily, 35-0. It looked‘
as if Pitt would never grab A
Bowl victory.

Just as times looked the
and Pitt haphazardly stumbled
through a fair season, losing to Du-
q_uesne and suffering a tie, in 1935,
the University of Washington in-
vited the Panthers to play in the
Rose Bowl for‘ the fourth time in
eight years. This time it was
either do or die. Sparked by pep-
pery Bobby LaRue, it was do. They
won 21-0.

Blocking, Tackling Highlight Practice

Sessions of Panther Grid Yearlings

Pitt’s varsity heroes were absent
in body but not in spirit from the
hilltop ﬁeld last Friday as Coach
Nick Kliskrey’s charges showed the
old “Sc-ckit-to-’em” drive in a vig-
orous practice session.

Blocking and tackling were
among the more welcome tasks of
the hustling freshmen after tedi-
ous drilling in such fundamentals
as stance‘, and “cutting.” The boys
have to l»carn their assignments
perfectly; they even have to know
just how many steps to take in what
direction before executing their
part of the play. A ‘

Coach Kliskey has kept up the
practice of asking the boys with-
out warning what they _do, or even

what a teammate does, on a partic-i.
‘Two years ago, when"

Mike Milligan, now of Florida, was

Slightly less than four minutes
after the second quarter began, the

halfback Kinkade. Charley Maag."

1"ourth down ﬁeld goal from the 25,
and just then the three points look--
ed awfully big. ’ A
Then came the thrill-packed third
quarter. Pitt took the kickoff, got
noweher, and tried to quick-kick.
Maag boomed through the line and
took Jones’s kick on his chest. Try-
ing to carry the ball over ‘for A
touchdown, he stepped out of
bounds on the four, but Langhurst
easily made the distance on the
next play. When Scott kicked the
extra point, State was ahead 10-0.
It was here that Pitt came
through with the most courageous
drive of the game. After Maag’s
kick-off went out of bounds, the
Panthers took the ball on their 35
and pounded 65 yards to a score.
Passes were forgotten as the Pitt
forward wall cut State’s defense to
bits and allowed Kracum and Thur-
bon to pick up big chunks of yard-
age. Kracum, the ﬁnest back on the
ﬁeld, ﬁnally set up the touchdown
on the one yard line from where
Thurbon cracked over. Mike
Sekala’s conversion was good.
.Unfortunately, State wasn’t fin-

ished. Immediately after the next
kick-off, a Langhurst-Fisher lateral
gained 38 yards and after Lang-
hurst lost four at end, "Don Scott
ﬂipped a long pass to Langhurst
who cut behind John Ross, caught
thepball easily, and crossed the goal
line. Again Scott converted. . '

and was -dropped on the Panther
35. In six plays State scored, Scott
ﬁring one to Anderson for the touch-
down. Graf’s placementi made it
24-7.

The Panther first team, which had
been removed just before the third
period ended, came back in to open
the final quarter, but. the Buckeyes
did more damage. Bill Sexton
blazed two passes, one to Horvath
and a touchdown shot to Fox, and
the scoring ended for the day.

Bureau Reveals

"Industrial Decline

Pittsburgh’s business activity
dropped slightly under last week’s,
according to the index compiled by
the University Bureau of Business
Research.

Recorded at 126.1 per cent of the
1923-25 average, the decline repre-
sented a falling-off of 1.5 per cent
from the preceding index of 127.6
per cent. The drop was attributed
to less-than—seasonal rises in iron

A New Tuck Shop _

Rounds‘ the Corner

No secret implements of war
are being constructed behind those
black barriers which shut off one
quarter of the ground ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, only a new Tuck Shop,
“bigger and better than even.”

Modeled after the Kathedral
Kitchenette, which opened last
year in a blaze of stainless steel,
red leather, and chromium, the
new Kampus Kafetcria will seat
700 hungry students in all the
luxury that Albert Klimchek, Uni-
versity architect, can provide.

Not much is being said in ad-
ministration circles about the in-
novations to be presented with
the new Tuck Shop, but one ru-
mor has it that HOT food will be
served.

Higher Quota

All physically and mentally ﬁt
students who have registered for
ROTC this year but who have been
kept out by the University’s low
quota will be admitted to classes
in both the basic and advanced
training sections.

Special permission for the new
University quota was obtained Fri-
day from the Army department in
Washington, Colonel Ralph W. Wil-
son, head of the University unit, re-

vealed in a long distance call from
the capital.

Under the new arrangement,
there will be 501 freshmen in the
basic course, 328 sophomores, 106
About 160

medical corps.

Many of the juniors and seniors

mitted to take, the instruction but

:ROTC this year was not anticipated

in the government quota. As a re-
sult, funds were not. available to
take care of additional enrollees.

Avinoff Will Help

t With Soap Contest

Dr. Andrey Avinoti", advisory pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts, will serve on the
sponsorship committee of the sev-

enteenth annual National Soap
Sculpture contest this year.
Contestants compete for cash

prizes offered by the Procter and
Gamble company and special prizes
of a bronze or pottery cast of Dr.
Avinoff’s sculpture.

A part of the sculpture submitted
will be lent for exhibition in mu-
seums, art organizations, and schools
throughout the United States.

i The popularity of soap carving
is increasing monthly, and the de-
mand for a practical book on the
subject has led the committee to co-
operate with Lester Gaba, leading
soap sculptor, in publishing a popu-
lar edition of his book, “Soap Carv-
ing.” “Soap carving is compre-
hensive, entertaining, and of ines-
timable value to all who have
turned to this fascinating craft, the
Cinderella of sculpture,” says Mr.
Gaba. _
