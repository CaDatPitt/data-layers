The Obama campaign opened l
its Oakland ofﬁce last evening and J
used the opportunity to wrangle in I
volunteers. .

The office is ‘located between I
Meyran,Avenue and McKee Place
on Fifth Avenue, tucked into the
western edge of Pitt's campus.
“Pittsburgh is the ground zero
of our western Pennsylvania strat— l
egy because what we’re really hop— I
ing to do here is drive up our vote 5
total in Pittsburgh, the amount of
people who vote here, and register-
ing more students because that way
we can offset the challenges we’re
going to be facing in the rest of
western Pennsylvania,” said Alex ‘
Merchant, a ﬁeld organizer for the
campaign.

Merchant spoke brieﬂy to the
attendees of the opening about the
importance of volunteering and the
Pittsburgh vote. ,

“If you’re_ re_ally committed to
electing Sen. Obanriai,\t}Tenj7otrhave- ,

to commit to volunteering,” he said.

“The  that wins elections is
when people talk to other people.”

lison Price said the student vote
and volunteering are crucial to the
campaign.

“We’re thrilled with Oakland
because the students of Pitt, CMU

i and Duquesne have been very in-
volved to date,” _said Price. “And
this gives them the opportunity to
be close to where they live and be
more involved.”

Staff members were on hand
to answer ‘prospective volunteers’
questions. Visitors could i also
sign up for events like “Steps for
Change,” a voter registration drive
during which volunteers will be sta-
tioned on staircases around the city.

“At this point, it’s primarily a‘
big push to get as many students
registered‘ as we possibly ca.n,” said
campaign volunteer Theresa Miller-
Sporrer, “because the bigger the
voter pool, the bigger the voter
turnout, the better the results of the
election are going to be.” '

Volunteers will encourage peo-
ple to vote, make phone calls and
participate in local events,‘ said Pitt
sophomore Julie Rozen. Yet, she
said, the main focus right now is
to get as many. people registered to

by Katelyn Polantz
l'?itor  C/zicf.

Pitt officially changed the University
policy for nondiscrimination yesterday
to include “gender identity or‘ expres-
sion,” said Pitt vice chancellor of com-
munications Robert Hill. C

“The Chancellor made the decision,

so the process to make it official was to 0

get it through the channels,” said Hill.

Nordenberg approved the change-

this summer following a resolution
from the Student‘Government Board.
After that, Hill said that the decision
had to pass through the Office of the

Budget and Controller, headed by vice '

‘chancellor Arthur G. Ramicone, and be

worded correctly to fit into the stand-
ing policy. ‘ —

Pitt’s former nondiscrimination
policy prohibited discrimination_or_ha—
rassment based on race, color, religion,
national origin, ancestry, sex, age, mari-
tal status, familial status, sexual orien-

had not protected students, faculty and

Rising natural gas prices making

students seek new payment plans  

by  Stover
For T be Pitt New

Students living off campus may ﬁnd
themselves -struggling to keep the heat on
this winter. With Pittsburgh’s characteris-
tically unpredictable weather, many might
need totake measures to counter the rising
cost of natur_a.l gas.

Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commis-
sion has predicted that monthly bills will
rise by 18.29 percent for Dominion Peo-
ples’ customers and 13.3 percent for Equi-
table Gas customers this winter, compared
to last winter. A

The Department of Energy attributes
this to the damage caused by hurricanes in

_ the Gulf of Mexico. As of yesterday, the

Minerals Management Service said \that
93.8 percent of natural gas from the gulf
was inaccessible because of storm damage.
Because gas companies change their prices

quarterly, consumers will not see this re-'

ﬂected in  bill until Oct. 1. V

Dan Shelly, a Pitt junior whose rent
does not include his utilities, said ‘that
his bill for natural gas last winter already

strained his budget and that increases this
year might lead him to cut back.

He said spending more money on
heat would leave him with “less money for
entertainment” and that he would have to
work additional hours to compensate for
the increased costs.

Some students have found a way
around paying excessive amounts for heat-
ing. Pitt junior Jamie Keafer said she found
a way around the system by signing up for
a special plan. A ‘ ~ . c

“I knew it would be ridiculous, so I

‘got on the budget plan,” she said.

The state offers a variety of options
for those "tight on cash. For those with
a low enough income,‘ the Pennsylvania
Low—Income Home Energy Assistance
Program offers Crisis Grants for emergen-
cies.

, Also, all natural gas companies offer
budget billing, which allows customers to
spread the cost of natural gas throughout
the year, so that they can pay off part of
the winter cost in the less expensive sum-
mer months. V

In addition, if a’ customer under a

certain income cannot pay his bill, the gas
companies may not shut off service in the

winter months.

Alon with statistics on natural as
3 8
prices, the utility commission offers on its
Web site suggestions on how to conserve
natural gas in the winter. .

According to the site, consumers
should move belon ' s awa from heat-

gmg Y
ing and cooling registers, lower the tem-
perature on the water tank, wash clothes
and dishes in full loads and properly seal
windows and doors to revent drafts.

Debate coach
regretful, not
traveling

by Halyse Domencic
Staﬂ Writer

There will be no more debating for
Shanara Reid-Brinkley, an assistant profes-
sor in Pitt’s Department of Communica-
tion, this year.

After the video of a verbal brawl be-
tween her and former Fort Hays State
University professor William Shanahan
at a Cross Examination Debate Associa-
tion event this past March a appeared on
YouTube, Pitt made an inquiiy into Reid-
Brinkley's actions. The University made its
conclusion yesterday.

Reid-Brinkley's behavior during the
post—debate discussion of the quarterfi-
nal of the event did not meet University
standards, according to a University news
release.

All attempts to Contact faculty mem-
bers, including Reid—Brinkley, were directed
to Pitt spokesman and vice chancellor Rob-
ert Hill.

“Faculty members are expected to con—
duct themselves in a professional manner,
especially when representing the Univer-
sity,” said Hill in the release.

Reid—Brinkley said she has reflected on
the incident and will not travel with the de-
bate team or act as a coach for the remain-
der of this academic year.

Pitt said it agrees with the association
that something should be done to improve
behavior during the debate tournaments.
As a result, Pitt will no longer participate in
tournaments sponsored by the association.

“I deeply regret my language choices
during this incident,” said Reid—Brinkley in
the release. “Despite serious provocation,
such language was unprofessional. I apolo-
gize for any embarrassment I have caused
the University.”

Last stop for the Port Authority .

Onorato shouldn't withhold drink tax
money from Port Authority

Across the city of Pittsburgh,
Port Authority buses are a familiar
sight as they traverse their routes
and carry thousands of people to
destinations across the city every

‘ day. According to Port Authority
' data, more than 70 million rides

are taken on the system every year

 in an area with fewer than 2 million
3 people.

Given that, it’s difficult to see

, why Allegheny County chief ex-
 ecutive Dan Onorato and Port
1 Authority CEO Steve Bland seem
: content to see the system go bank-
 rupt.

“The Port Authority’s not go-

L  to survive,” said Onorato in an
E interview with the Pittsburgh Post-
 Gazette on Monday. “The service
 probably won’t survive through
 the end of the year.”

Onorato has refused to release

3 the roughly $27 million in county
‘ funds gained from the much—de-
; bated alcoholic drink and car rental
i taxes, money which is legally nec-
t essary for the Authonty to receive

the nearly $185 million in state

 funds that comprise nearly half the
 service’s yearly budget.

According to Onorato, the

 money would have simply been a
 “Band-Aid” measure that wouldn’t
5 prevent the service from going
j bankrupt under its existing con-
. tract, and he is withholding the
, funds in an effort to threaten the
 union back to the bargaining table.

The Amalgamated Transit

. Union Local 85’s president, Patrick
. McMahon, rejected the recom-

mendations of a fact ﬁnder’s re-

 port that Onorato said he believes

would have solved many of Port

, Authority’s budgetary concerns,
I but McMahon has said that the
lunion is still  to negoti-
 ate. ATU Local 85 represents the
 unionized workers of the Port Au-
 thority.

What’s difficult to understand

 is why Onorato and Bland are
E willing to allow the Port Authority

to crash and burn within the next

year. Onorato is withholding the ‘
funds needed to keep it running, 
rather than taking part in negotiat- 
ing a solution that both parties are 
roundly willing to accept. Instead, 
Onorato has criticized McMahon 
for rejecting the fact finder’s report 
without ‘allowing all union mem- 5
bers to vote on it, a practice with 
which the union executives strong- 

ly disagree.

In other words, Onorato has i

decided that the fact-finder report

was as good as the deal is likely to 

get, and he has closed down ne- 3 The Giles ﬁles

loss and that the retirement pen— 5

But in the report, fact-finder 
Jane Rigler said that the Port Au-

omy, and any shutdown or signiﬁ- :
cant shrinkage of service could 
have dire effects across the entire 3

Palin asked the congregation at
her former Pentecostal church to
pray that “our national leaders are
sending US. soldiers on a task that
is from God.” She went on to say,
“That’s what we have to make sure
we’re praying for, that there is a plan
and that plan is God’s p .”

This direct line that Palin shares
with an omnipotent being can only
come in handy at the \White House.
Should we bomb Iran? Ask God,
he’ll know. Raise or cut taxes? Odds
are that God has a plan for taxation.
If only God would give our nation-
al leaders the task of ending hunger
instead of  Iraqis.

Indeed, looking at Palin’s record
as mayor and governor, I have to
say that she’s done a heckuva job
executing divine policy. Nothing
says spiritual like attempting to re-
move books from libraries that
teach children that homosexuals are
people or supporting the teaching
of creationism in schools because
one shouldn’t “be afraid of infor-
mation.”

There are really no drawbacks
to Palin’s faith-based social policies.
The whole “teaching abstinence
rather than safe sex in schools”
thing worked out especially well.

One  that I am worried
about is that Palin is a little too well-

traveled. Having traveled to Kuwait,
Germany, Canada and Mexico, Pa-
lin is conclusively the best—traveled
female vice presidential candidate
from Alaska in this nation’s history.

But at this time in our history
we do not need a leader — or vice
leader — who understands the
world around them and who brings
perspective to their position. Calvin
Coolidge never traveled to Kuwait
and was probably the most success-
ful Republican VP-turned-president
of all time.

So what if she didn’t know what
the Bush Doctrine was? From the
reaction in the media you’d think
that the Bush Doctrine had been
the  force behind American
foreign policy for the last six years.

Then the press called her in-
experienced. But need I remind
the reader that Palin was not only
the mayor of a town of 6,000 but
also the governor of a state with a

population of 600,000 people and.__
950,000 caribou? That’s one—fifth

of all the caribou in the world, by
the way.

Governing a state with a popu-
lation of more than 1.5 million has

Oliver Stone ﬁlminakes Bush into a mythic ﬁgure

by Erik Hinton

Colummilt

I’m' sure you’re all chewing your
ﬁngernails to a pulp waiting for the
movie that is being released next
month. I am speaking of neither
the Marky Mark-goes—gamer-nerd
fantasy “Max Payne” nor the shin-
ing “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,” a
movie which will doubtlessly spark
a wave of never-before-seen anti-
Disney violence.

Actually, I am referring to Oli-
ver Stone’s new epic, ‘W’ In case
you were unaware of this upcom-
ing release, please take a moment to
soak it in. Yes, it’s about George W
Bush. ' '

I am not here, though, to lament
Stone’s bombast or gall in  up
such a project. Stone’s “Any Given
Sunday” and “Alexander” are far
more perfect targets for this criti-
cism than any successive ﬁlm of
his could ever be. I am not going
to gnash my teeth and moan about
how unfortunately political the ﬁlm
might be or how unfairly apolitical
it might be otherwise.

to ﬁnancial and  ruin in the

past seven years. t

But enough about Palin haters,

-let’s get back to the candidate her-

self.

In an op—ed published in The
New York Times, Palin correctly
wrote that “polar bears are magniﬁ-
centianirnals, not cartoon charac-

ters.”
This is true: Polar bears, like

Instead, I am  umbrage
with the fact that the ﬁlm is being
universally described as humaniz-
ing. Both the studio and critics are
scrambling to detail just how hu-
man the ﬁlm makes Bush and why
the lame duck deserves this t:teat—
ment. _

Such a tactic is by no means a
new one for Stone — see his 1995
“Nixon” — but that does not

mean it is an entirely benign one._

Sure, looking at the personal life

‘of a publicjﬁgure can be edifying,

but what does‘ it mean to human-

ize them, andiwhat are theside ef-

fects?

The prickly side of humaniza-
tion is that it always succeeds in
creating exactly what it aims to
undo: mythology. The  force
behind the will to humanize is the
idea that a sufﬁciently capable artist

I can cut through the mythic pomp

around a ﬁgure and sketch out what
the man is like rather than the leg-
end.

However, something covert
goes on behind the scenes of this
seemingly attractive strategy. To

bears are not cartoons

other bear species, are not cartoon
characters. The fact that Palin was
willing to stand up to the big-money
interests that supported listing the
polar bearas a threatened species is
impressive. I ‘

It takes a lot of gumption, lead-
ership and governing acumen to be
able to tell people when animals are
and —— more importantly — are not
cartoons.

make it your explicit task to human-
ize a person is implicitly to suggest
that such a ﬁgure needs humaniza-
tion. A project of humanization
confers on its subject mythic status.

_ Saying that Stone’s “W” human-
izes Bush is tantamount to arguing
that all other portrayals of Bush in
the media do not accomplish this
feat. Such a claim is . not terribly
wrong in cases’ of a historical ﬁgure
like Alexander the Great or a more-'
than-farnous celebrity such as Mar-
lon Brando. However, we are talk-
ing about a man whose very human

faults have been plastered all over

the national media for eight years.
Mythology surrounds chiseled
Greek warriors, not poorly articu-
lated good ol’ boys. The human-
izing objective of Stone’s biopic is
to convince us that we see Bush as
a face of evil in a 10-gallon hat or
some other mythic character. The
danger is that the media are very
good at convincing us. Bush is dan-
gerous enough. Do we really want
to allow him to be made mythic?
An additional problem with hu-
manization is that it is ultimately a

So here’s to you, Sarah Palin.
May fog never cloud your View of -
Russia, may God always tell you of
his plans, and may you never have to

failed enterprise. Not only do hu-
manizing works mythologize public
ﬁgures, but they also support the
myth that it is possible to make a

, public ﬁgure into just another per-

son. This is impossible by the sheer
fact that the ordinary person does

not have one of the biggest direc- I

tors in Hollywood attach his name
to his story and pour $30 million
into the endeavor.

To say that your ﬁlm humanizes
a ﬁgure is to do nothing more than

. try to win audiences over subtly to

believe that your version of a per-
sons life is an authentic one. It is
just a new mythin sheep’s clothing.

But what is the actual danger of
this whole mess? Mythology is -not

' problematic in itself, so why should

a new myth be  to worry
about? The issue is twofold. First,
most myths identify themselves as
myth, and we can then deal with

them accordingly. There is not too‘

much doubt about the mythic status
of Hercules. When we read about a
man who could hold the world on

"his shoulders,ino one claims that

any man that we might encounter

in the world could similarly ‘per-

form this task. ,
 ﬁlms construct
myths that their subjects are larger-

than-life without letting viewers

' know that what they are watching .

is a myth. I am not saying that audi-
ences cannot separate Hollywood
from reality but that audiences can-
not separate the images they have
of public ﬁgures that they develop
for themselves from the one that
the media instill in them. .
 ‘second, traditional myths
are products of a collective culture.
The myths that humanizing movies
create are products of a few men
and their crew When culture is cre-
ating myth, there is some democrat-
ic ﬁlter. In ﬁlm, we lose control.
The take—home message: When
you go to see “W”, or, more likely,
when you stay home from the the-
ater, keep a keen eye on the myth

you are being sold. Take humaniza- ’

tionwith a grain of salt and demand
a say in your mythology.

  Death I/Magnetic   sure

to attract thrash fans

by Matt Chmura
For The Pitt Newd
Death Magnetic ‘
Metal Iicai
Warner Bros.

Rocks like: Anthrax, Slayer

 

The album’s first track
begins with the steady thump
of a heart, its beating echoing
the anticipation and appre-
hension of what Metallica’s
Death Magnetic will bring. Me-
lodic strums of a quiet  hang and distort,
gradually gaining volume and anger until the
first riff slams home.

   

Q;

~~....._—-W‘ I

 

The album’s crown jewel and true ex-
ample of Metallica’s mastery of structure and
melody is, a nearly 10-minute instrumental ti-
tled “Suicide & Redemption.” This epic song

— almost a  session — is reason enough

_ to purchase this long-awaited album that

dropped on Sept. 12. The track effortlessly
weaves heavy, dark rhythms with harmoni-

‘ous solos that leap up and down the scale

as the pounding of drummer Lars Ulrich’s
double bass keeps the tempo of the song al-
ternating from blindingly fast to comfortably
unhurried. True to Metallica’s roots, there is
not much bass to be heard — just the con-
stant battle of rhythm and melody. However,
one of the brief moments when ‘new bassist
Robert Trujillo stands out is in the opening

of “Suicide & Re-

Hesitation is quickly
blown away as the

H pulsating  sends

the population’ into
a fit of spontaneous
head-banging.

' Death Magnetic is '
the album that fans
of early Metallicai
have been praying
‘for. The band returns
to its thrash metal
roots, while attempt-
ing to retain some
of «its experimental
charm that has made

While Death
Magnetie is littered

songs seem out of
place in the pre-
dominantly thrash
album. “Cyanide,”
which focuses more
on the singing of
Hetﬁeld, lacks the
explosiveness of
the stand-out tracks
on the album and
sounds .more like
a poorly done pro-
v gressive rock track
than thrash metal.

 

metal.

“The Day That .
Never Comes,” thelﬁrst single, sounds more
progressive than thrash, but it does so in a
surprisingly refreshing way. The memorable
chorus, which says, ‘‘\Waiting for the one /
The day that never comes / When you stand
up and feel the warmth / But the sunshine
never comes, no,” complements the whirl-

 nffs, quick note-stabbing and blending‘

rhythm. The song starts out a bit sluggish, but
the band brilliantly saves the song in the lat-
ter half. I _ - .

Thankfully, the album is loaded "with
some of the best  solos that lead gui-
tarist Kirk Hammett has played since “Black-
ened.” His mind-numbing riffs stand out
especially on the album’s second track, “The
End of the Line,” which is about the tur-
moil of a doomed rock star. The notes bend
and warp beautifully under Harnrnett’s well-
seasoned ﬁngers as a steady dose of rhythm

- from James Hetﬁeld offers a repetitive under-

tone that only-accentuates the blur of reso-
nance in the solos.

Weak lyrics like
, “Sleep, and dream
of this / Death angel’s kiss / Brings ﬁnal bliss

, / Come. believe me!” only serve to bog the

song down even more.

Another utmecessary and out-of—place
track is “The Unforgiven III.” Symphonic
strings and horns have always been a 
way to experiment in. metal, and Metallica
is noted for doing so, but it does not_ﬁt the
theme of the album. Naturally reminiscent
of “The Unforgiven,” but lacking the flare
and polish of. the original or even the second

I installment, “The Unforgiven III” is an easily I

forgettable song. - ‘
Thrash isiwhat made _Metallica what it
is today, and the album’s most memorable
songs are the epitome of thrash metal. The
long-awaited return to its roots is a welcome
reprieve from some of the 'band’s more ad-
venturous endeavors. Death Magnetic may not
rival Ride the Lzghtning or Matter of Pzgbpetx in
scope, but it does give alienated fans a chance
to rekindle a love for one of the best bands of

all time in the mosh pits where it all began.

and we’ve been friends ever since. I like
her drive, and I like her spirit. And Donna
[Cole] is Kelly O.’s sister,” explained Ben-

'1‘1€‘L’t.

It was O’Connor’s drivethat kick—started
the creation of the Diner Ladies. “Kelly O.
was tending [a] bar in the South Side, and
she decided she didn’t want to do that for
the rest of “her life. So she did the impos-
sible for a‘girl making ﬁve dollars an hour.
She walked into a restaurant and asked if it
was for sale.” It wasn’t, but the owner called
her back and decided to sell it to her.

‘When she opened I went to work for

her for a cou le of weeks” said Bennett
7 3 _‘

lwho at that time was retired from running
Bob’s, a diner that she and her husband
owned in Crafton. But retirement wasn’t
for her.

“I. worked for Kelly for a couple of
months and I thought, ‘Hey, I could do
this.’” So she and her husband started Hot
Metal Diner.

Cole worked side by side with O’Connor
and Bennett. “I went over to help Kelly out
for a little while,‘and I thought, ‘I love t-his.

 

PITT ATS

It’s a great atmosphere.’”

So in a move characteristic of the Diner
Ladies’ direct approach, Cole started look—
ing for a diner to purchase. '

“My family thought I was crazy. I had
never worked in a restaurant before,” said
Cole. “I have three sisters, and my younger
sister likes to say about Kelly and me, ‘It
was like watching Lucy and Ethel, and peo-
ple just came to see what we were going to
mess up next.”’

Cole said reﬂectively, “You take all your

'life’s experience and hopefully you’ll learn

from them. I have,” she said. “God knows

I’ve learned a lot more than I wanted to I

know some days. We were the underdogs,
we just were regular working women, who
decided, ‘I’ve had enough, I’m going to try
working for myself now.’ And it’s worked,”-
she said.

Bennett credits the Diner Ladies for
much of her success. “I know how to bet-
ter run a place. I know how to better own
a place.” She added, “Now it’s not just one
independent business up against the world
— there’s four of us.”

Large Hadron Collider
doesn't destory earth

by Donald Campbell
Staﬂ [Writer

The Large Hadron Collider promises to
bring scientists a much needed look into
the early, high-energy life of the universe.
Directly after the Big Bang, the energy of
the early universe was so high that the fun-
damental forces of nature were uniﬁed,
 high—intensity particles wildly collided.

Not until later in the universe’s early
life did the ambient temperature reduce
enough for the modern subatomic — and
later, the modern atomic —- structures to
form.

Understanding the period before the
separation of forces and before the creation
of stable subatomic particles is essential
for scientists to understand the evolution
of the current fundamental forces, and in
turn, the very nature of matter, energy and
structure in the universe.

Unfortunately, up until quite recently
the energies required to recreate this time
period were far beyond scientists’ reach.

Despite what some crack-
pots on the Internet seemed
to predict, the high-energy
proton beams of the LHC did
not set in motion the annihi-
lation of the entire universe at
the hands of excess quantities
of anti-matter.  

z: , ,
.->"i -9‘

Although scientists have been able to create
many of the subatomic particles thought
to be major players in the universe’s early
development, energy limitations have rele-
gated perhaps the most important particle,
the Higgs’ boson, to the pages of a math-
ematician’s notebook. The Higgs’ boson is
thought to be the fundamental source for
the elusive deﬁnition of mass in the uni-
verse.

The good news is that the LHC was
successfully completed and turned on. As
an added bonus, despite what some crack-
pots on the Internet seemed to predict, the
high-energy proton beams of the LHC
did not set in motion the annihilation of
the entire universe at the hands of excess
quantities of anti-matter.

The data from the LHC has begun pour-
ing into the CERN-based high-throughput
computing system, ready for organization
and ultimate interpretation. And with all of
this making headline news, one would think

that the CERN people would be extra care-
ful to secure their computer system.

The BBC recently reported, however,
that even though the CERN computer ad-
ministrators took precautions, hackers were
able to compromise the LHC’s computer
system successfully and gain access to an
unspeciﬁed amount of data. According to
the BBC’s article, although ofﬁcials at the
LHC do not believe any important data
was compromised, the Web site did display
some hacker propaganda. H

The Web site is now unavailable, pend-
ing corrections and installations of further
security measures. If no data was compro-
mised, the problem is essentially solved
with the addition of security patches. Un-
fortunately, because so much data is being
transferred and interpreted, small changes
in computer data may be difficult to de-
tect.

The LHC ofﬁcials got lucky, in a way,
as the BBC reported that the hacked com-
puter system was not used to control or
edit the properties of the LHC device or
experiment itself. The hacked computer
was merely an output device used to moni-
tor the progression of the LHC “big-bang”
experiment. '

Think about the implications of a ma-
jor hack. If a major control or data-storage
machine is compromised at the LHC, the
data edited may be impossible to detect.
Small deviations in the data could cause in-
terpretation efforts to fail or could lead to
false conclusions. The LHC, although large
and hulking, is an extremely ﬁne-tuned
machine. Hacks in control machines could
cause physical damage to the device itself,
delaying or even canceling future experi-
ments.

What is CERN doing about this prob-
lem? Everything it can. Unfortunately, as
the BBC reported, the experiments at the
LHC require the input of hundreds, even
thousands of people. Securing a network
that large is a daunting task and may even
prove to be impossible to complete to full
satisfaction.

Luckily for us, despite what the Internet
says, the LHC can in no way kill us all. Even
if a hacker manages to overload it, the re-
sult may be only to reach unprecedented
energy levels, which would, in turn, lead to
unprecedented insights into the early uni-
verse.

The LHC Web site at the CERN facility

is www.cmsmon.cern.ch. It may come back .

online once CERN ofﬁcials are satisﬁed
that they have fixed or patched the security
holes allowing for the recent attack.

The Pitt women’s soccer team got its ﬁrst shut-
out of the season when it blanked Kent State, 14),

consecutive year that the Panthers beat them
Pitt coach Sue-Moy Chin said that although

‘We started outreally slow,” said Chin.
Although Pitt outshot Kent State 6-5 in the
eﬁrst half, neither teamhad a legitimate scoring
chance in the ﬁrst 45 minutes
"Pitt broke the scoreless drought in the 49th
minute when sophomore Laura Betbert rocketed

a shot passed the Kent State goalie, Kelly Sher-

t.he game, but Chin said that it wasn’t a big deal.
“Both teams had to play through it,” she said.
As the weather conditions worsened, Pitt’s

Late last week, Pitt offensive coordinator Matt

the season was “crummy.”

Although he agreed that it  in Pitt’s

to really step up because there will be a lot of one-

The good news for Pitt is that Iowa opponents
sacked quarterbackjake Christensen 46 times last
year The bad news? Christensen lost his job to
sophomore Ricky Stanzi, and the line thatstarted
late last year returns

The Pitt defensive line, regarded as one of the
top lines in the league heading into this season,
struggled to make too much of an impact so far
this season. There are a few guys who are banged
up, but with Mick \X/illiams and Greg Romeus,
Pitt should be able to start controlling the line of
scrimmage

If not, it could be a long day for the Panther

defense

On the offensive side of the ball, Pitt is still
learning what it is capable of doing Quarterback
Bill Stull has very little starting experience, meaning
he should improve each game

Tailback IaRod Stephens—Howling is averag-
ing 6.6 yards per carry but only rushed the ball
14 times. LeSean McCoy, on the other hand, has
touched the ball 43 times out of the backﬁeld and
gained just 164yards, anaverage of 3.8percarry

This means a headache for Cavanaugh and the
coaching staff

There’s nothing wrong with -Stephens—Howl-
ing getting fewer carries than McCoy, because
McCoy,  the more talented back, deserves
more carries He’s a more explosive back and has
the chance to break the game open every time he
gets the ball.

But when Stephens—Howling is  success,
he can be a huge asset for the team. And he’s a
greatchange of pacewho canbreakthe playwide
open, just like McCoy can. ’

Cavanaugh needs to ﬁgure out a way to get
both of these guys involved in the game plan. The
Panthers can also use fullback Conredge Collins,
who’s ranked by espn.com’s Mel Kiper Jr as the
best senior fullback in the country. Collins has just

one rush for seven yards this season. For a guy as

Buffalo last week. Pitt hosts Iowa Saturday for the first time in 56 years.

talented as Collins, that’s not enough He needs to
get the ball more.

As far as the other skilled positions go, Ca-
vanaugh said last week that he and the coaching
staff plan on  freshman receiver Jonathan
Baldwin involved in more plays, along with junior
Greg Cross, a transfer from junior college who can
run the option. Look for Cross to appear if Pitt is
somewhere between the 35-yard lines and in need

of a change of pace, where the pressure won’t be
too bad. 6
It’s hard to say what this weekend will bring for
Pitt. The Panthers have yet to see a team as talent-
ed as Iowa But the same goes for the Hawkeyes
This is a huge game for the Panthers And with
the schedule getting tougher, this game could be
big when deciding bowlcligibility at the end of the
