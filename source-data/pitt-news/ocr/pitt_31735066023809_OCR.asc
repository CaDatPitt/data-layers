SGB Gesletner Printing Service
Targeriof BAS Criticism o

By Clare Gleason
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Ciestetner printing service,
purchased by the Student Govern-
ment Board this summer, was the
target of criticism by the Black Ac-‘
tion Society at yesterday’s SGB
meeting.

BAS submitted proofs for
typesetting to the SGB Allocations
Committee with the impression that
the services could be provided by
the Gestetner service as promised
when the money was allocated to
the group,_ according to Colleen
Clarke, allocations committee
chairman. .

“A lot of groups are saying this is
not what they want. Some type of
action must be taken immediately,”

Clarke said. The SGB mustdo one
of two things as soon as’ possible;
either fund the groups to enable
them to go to Central Printing or
say “no, you’ve been allocated for
our service and you have to use
what we can ptovide,”- Clarke told
the board members. “Whatever we
decide, needs to be decided im-
mediately. Black Week is
November 10,” Clark added.

The printing service is not what‘
the groups expected, according to

Clarke.

“We told them initially that this

was ~ like going to a printer, so
maybe their expectations were way
too high. They were expecting a
nice service; can it be done?”
Clarke queried the board.

Brinkley Faces Life In Prison

By the Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA - Sidney
Brinkley faces a life imprisonment
sentence for the August 1979 rape-
murder of his girlfriend’s sister. . _

A Common Pleas Court jury on
Saturday convicted Brinkley of
first-degree murder and rape in the
death of Shelia Hill, 15, and then
reconvened Monday to consider the
sentence. . t

However, after deliberating for
more than two hours, the jury told
Judge Robert A. Latrone’ it could
not argee on whether to sentence
Brinkley to life imprisonment or
death.

State law provides for an
automatic life sentence when a jury
cannot decide onthe sentence in a
first-degree murder case.

Inﬂation Should Stabalize
According to Forecasters

By MIKE MALLINGER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Inﬂation should stabalize at under
10 percent during 1981 according to
a panel ‘of experts who spoke at the
annual Pitt economic forecast panel
at the Pitt Faculty Club.

“The only game in town i's
monetary policy,” said Lee
Hoskins, senior vice president and
economist of Pittsburgh National
Bank to an audience of nearly 60.
He was referring to the Federal
Reserve’s new policy of keeping the
lid on money supplies instead of
manipulating interest rates as it had
done in the past.

Hoskins further said that he
predicted a “flat economy” during
1981. There would be no recovery

I but projected a three to four per-

cent real growth rate.

“The Federal Reserve is the main
player. It will take a, longer term
view than in the past,”- Hoskins
said. It will be a rather sluggish year
according to Hoskins’ predictions.

Last year the Federal Reserve
allowed interest rates to seek their
own level. The prime rate soared to
20 percent and many became
critical of chairman Paul Volcker’s
policy. Since that time interest rates
have come down and Reuben Sies-

inger, professor of ecgnomics at.

Pitt and" moderator of the panel,

- predicted an 11 percent averaging

out of interest rates in 1981.
Slesinger said in an interview that

the most effective way to hold down

pressure on the dollar from abroad,

P especially from the Japanese, is

anti-dumping suits against Japanese

.4

steel makers. He preferred this
alternative to others, including im-
port quotas. He said that Reagan's
victory in the election would pro-
mote a more favorable business
climate. This would occur a few
months after Reagan took office if
he won the election.

No one ‘expected the Federal
Reserve to do anything drastic dur-
ing the next 15 months. Raymond
Reyes, manager of Pittsburgh Of-
fice Data Resources, lnc., com-
mented, “Perhaps the worst is
over,” adding, “the system has
shown rather dramatic strength.”

He said that he too expected a
rather sluggish year unless money
aggregates start to explode. In that
case the Federal Reserve ‘might
clamp a lid tightly on the money
supply. . -

'Mark DeWitt, an account ex-
ecutive at Merrill, Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith, said that he did

not anticipate a tax cut. The‘

economy will not be extremely
robust because the consumer will
not be spending as much as in the
past. ~

“He has been liquidating his debt
at record levels,” DeWitt said.

DeWitt said that one answer to
the high unemployment rate is a
more flexible job market.
Unemployed workers in one sector
of the economy could seek jobs in
another sector.

The Federal Reserve, Hoskins
said, is a “faceless group” but one
of the most powerful groups in the

United States. They are 12 people

BY TOM LOFTUS

-What do Andrew Young, Lynn

\ Swann, and Mel Blanc have in com-

mon?

They all have five letters in their
last. name, and they all have ap-
peared on television. But when you
search for other comparisons bet-
ween an ex-ambassador to the
United Nations, a footballplayer
who enjoys ballet, and a man who
makes a living talking funny, you
usually end up empty-handed.

Unless, however, you have been
aware of the current lecture
schedule that the Pitt Program
Council ,(PPC) has assembled for
the Fall term.

According to Bill Jackson, lec-
ture committee chairman, Young,
Swarm, and Blanc area few of the
speakers whom the PPC has signed
to lecture on campus.

“With a schedule like this, we
feel we have satisfied the two main
concerns of the committee,”
Jackson said. “First, we wanted a
diverse schedule and secondly, we
wanted to appeal to as many in-
terests as possible.”

The Andrew Young lecture last
month was the opening of the fall
schedule and it was a great success,
according to Jackson, despite what
he called the erroneous reporting of
attendance figures by the press.

“The Press gave the attendance
figure of 400, when the crowd ac-
tually numbered about 1600.”

Jackson said that the dicrepan-
cies between the figures “frustrated
the purpose of the PPC.”

“Since the student activities fee
hasbeen doubled, we are anxious to
show the students what they are get-
ting for their money, and we are
working very hard to accomplish
this,” he said.

The work that went into signing
Andrew Young started last April,
The normal pro-
cedure is to contact one of the five
orisix major lecture bureaus which

handle speakers such ‘as Young.‘

They then handle the negotiations,
write up the contracts, and may

« even help with advertising, accor-

ding to Jackson.

“The combined package of the
Andrew Young lecure, including
advertising, promotion, etc., was
$7000,”, Jackson said. “We
definitely consider him as the major
of major speakers this term.

 

Pitt Frogram

Afterall, he is the most recognized
black man next to Muhammed
Ali.” .
Jackson, however, pointed out
that the PPC will present at least
one major speaker each month.
“Lynn Swann will highlight the
October schedule, while Mel Blane,
the voice of Bugs Bunny, is one of
three 'major speakers‘ in
November.” .
Jackson said that he feels the
council has been able toioffer such
an attractive package because of in-

creased funds, from the student ac-

ambassador to the United Na-
tions who appeared at Pitt on
Sept. 23, and astronaunt Don

tivities fee: and the number of per-
sons working together in the PPC.

“We are definitely a lot more ac-
tive than last year, because we have
the money to work with, and this
allows . us to go after the big
names,” he said. ' '

But going after the “big names”
has been a problem to the PPC,
said Jackson.

“We sent a letter to each student
organization asking for sugggstions
of speakers, but there was very little
response. So we have to make
assumptions on what the student
wants.” ’ ‘ ' V .

Jackson said he realizes that the
PPC can never satisfy everyone, but
that they do try very hard to get a
variety of speakers. ~

j‘We saw that we had no woman
speaker for this term, so we are do-
ing our best to acquire one for next
semester.”

The PPC is composed of several.
committees that range from film
scheduling to arranging concerts,

. many of which already have several

ideas for next term according to
Jackson.

“My committee is working on a

series of mini-lectures which would
include members of the faculty and
local people lecturing on current
topics such as nuclear power and
politics. This idea is still in the

n‘ planning stage and it will take a lot

of work, but it will be worth it.”

Jackson said he jloined the PPC
when it was known as the Pitt
Union Program Council.

“We changed the ‘union’ to ‘pro-
gram’ this year because we wanted
to emphasize the program part.”

He_also added. that he has been
interested in the PPC ever since his
freshman_year when he heard John
Ehrlichman speak on campus.

“I thought it was great. To hear
someone like John Ehrlichman
speak in person. I knew I wanted to
get involved.” \

According to Jackson, his in-
volvement in the PPC_ has opened
up many experiences and has given
him the chance to meet may in-
teresting people.

“Imagine rubbing shoulders
with an Andrew Young. It’s just
great,” he added.

Fall Fraternity     a 'Slucceiss'l  I

By FRED BEERS

Fall fraternity rush this semester
was a success, with number of
fraternity pledges up 5-10 percent
according to Intrafraternity Coun-
cil President Donald Parella.

Thus far, 125 undergraduates
have joined Pitt’s 22 fraternities,
the same number at last year, but
have not yet
reported. Parella said he expects 10
to 15 percent more when the final
count is in. ‘

“We were expecting maybe a 25
to 30 percent increase, but I don’t

think the full impact of the new‘

fraternity rules was felt. If they

park on the Towers side of Fifth
Avenue, Walsh added.

Walsh said the decision was the
result of a three and a half year
campaign by the commuter com-
mittee to have the bus shelter on
Forbes Avenue side of the Student
Union moved to an active bus stop.

Walsh also informed the board
that John Vrana of the Business
and Finance Department had in-
formed him the shelter will be mov-
ed to the corner of Thackeray and
O’Hara streets as a result of a
survey done by the university con-A
cluding that this corner was an ac-
tive stop for the campus bus route.

Walsh also stated that the com-
muter committee will continue to
accept carpool participants. and

. hoped to coordinate the program by

the end of this month;

In addition, board member Joe
Blazer announced that the RSA
emergency loan request for $l800
needed to fund Collide-A-Scope
Magazine was still under considera-

tion by the board pending more in-

terviews with Donovan Hughes
from housing and Rob The, presi-
dent of RSA.

added.

were, the turnout would have been
much higher,” -Parella said.

' The new rules, which went into
effect this semester, limit the
amount of advertising a fraternity
may do as well as permitting open
rush for the first two weeks of a
semester, followed by two weeks of
rush by invitation only.

, In previous years, rush,was open
for three weeks and closed for one
week.

“It’s been as successful as it’s
been in the past,” Parella said,‘

Louis McLinden, fraternity ad-

visor in the Office of Student Ac-
tivities, agreed: “Traditionally, the
larger houses got more pledges, but
this year the smaller houses did bet-
ter.” _ -
“I think we’ve come a long way
in strengthening the system. We’ll
study the situation in January and
see what happens in January.
Overall though, we’re pleased,”
McLinden concluded.’

Pi Kappa Alpha -Vice-president
Tom Vater didn’t~think the rule
changes had that great a bearing im
the outcome.

f‘We’ve had a good rush, I don’t

think things changed that much
from last year,” Vater__said.
Greg Davis, President of Sigma

Chi, disagreed: "1 don’t like it,”‘~

Davis protested. “We managed to
do a good job but I think the rule
changes have an adverse affect.”
Davis said that he felt what the
IFC had in mind was to use the first
two weeks to get people over to the
fraternities and then weed them out
during the next two. i
“The IFC is overstepping their
bounds on this one,” Davis said.
“Some fraternities have their-
reputationeto fall back on, they get
a lot of pledges from friends of

brothers,” he added.

“I voted against it and I’d vote
against it again,” I Davis
acknowledged. “It’s an infringe-
ment on our rights.”

These claims are
founded”
“The limit on advertising spreads"
out those who rush, they find the

“not well

smaller houses are tighter, more .

close knit,” Parella said.

“Most of the people I've talked I

to are accepting it as part of the
system. When the new rules

become more pronounced, when

the people see the new style, then it
will have full impact,” he said.

Board member Walter Burke said
that Larry Schwartz, chairman of

the, student government elections ’

committee, has suggested can-
didates for student government of-
fices be allowed to use the Gestetner
facilities for campaign posters even
if they have to pay.

“Personally I don’t like the idea.
I think it will open up the Pandora’s
box for misusing the service,” he
added. ‘

Abraham said to che_ck the elec-
tion committee campaign regula-
tions code. I

“There’s something in there
about the use of student govern-
ment facilities,” according to
Burke.

“We could change the election

. code,” countered Scott Hendler.

“I don’t think it’s a bad idea. You
can’t get. much printed anywhere
with the fifty dollars each candidate
is allowed. The election code has
put so many restrictions on the

‘campaigns that as long -as the

facilities were equally available to

all candidates, I don’t see any pro-

blem with that,” Hendler said.
“That brings up another pro-

blem. Last year the maintenance
people on campus tore down the
election posters under direction of
supervisors who could never be
located. We should act on this
before the campaigning begins this
year,” Hend_ler said. - . .

“There is‘ an across-the-board

university policy prohibiting posters -

on the walls. They are supposed to
be posted on the bulletin boards,”
Abraham cited. '

“The SGB is a unique organiza-
tion touching all students on cam-
pus. We should be able to post
them, ” Hendler replied.

Bill ‘Abraham and RSA _ presi-
dent, Rob The, have met with the

- vice chancellor about the new visita-

ion policy.

“Rob, Al Mele, Patty Davis,
Joanne Woodson, Dr. Kimbo and I
met about an evaluative process of
the new visitation policy,”
Abraham said. “Part of this pro-
posed process will jnclude a series
of surveys of resident assistants,
desk attendants, board members,
and a random ‘survey of resident
students. Dr. John Wightman of
the Pennsvlvania Higher Education

Assistance Agency will tabulate the
results of the survey and students
interviews. It was stressed that the
issue is improving the -mechanics
and enforcement of the present
policy rather than changing it.”
According to The, RSA and the
SGB intend to prepare a counter
survey as the administrative survey
may be biased because many
students moved off campus last
year in protest of the new policy.
“We will survey off campus
residents as well as dorm
residents,” The said. \
“We felt we had to have our own
mechanisms to check the policy,”
said Abraham. “Dr. Kimbo feels
that it would be better for us to wait
until the administrative survey is
complete before we undertake our
survey,’f Abraham concluded.
“Most of the students in Towers
A and Bare freshman who haven’t

‘been affected by the previous

policy,” The said.

The board rejected a motion by
Hendler to install 50 American
ﬂags, one for each hostagelin Iran.

“It may be old news but it’s no
less serious,” said Hendler. “It_ is

The discussion was closed pen-

.Who’s Got

ThatExtra

S Parking Space?  

Sixty percent of all Pitt students commute from
home or other off-campus locations.
Of those commuting students, several thousand

drive cars to school each day, putting an additional-

strain on Oakland’s already insufficient parking sup-
‘ply. -

These autos, combined with those driven by
members of the faculty, staff and other employees,
contribute to an almost unbearable situation for all
involved.

Could it be that a representative of the city meter
maid sqaud was correct when interviewed recently by
The Pitt News? V

“The university is responsible for parking for
students,” she said.“They build all those beautiful
new buildings and don’t provide three or four floors
of underground parking. I think the problem is that

, they just don’t care.” '

“The city is only responsible for providing parking

‘ for,-people coming into the city to visit hospitals or

cultural events or things of that sort. Those people
have a hard time parking because students use all the

_ \ { .

We would like to think that the university does

I care andis working daily on the solutions to the ever

present problem -of finding a place to park in
Oakland. _

But regardless of what we would like to think, it
appears that the university doesn’t care and isn’t tak-
ing any action to remedy the situation.

The _shortage of suitable parking has plagued those
affiliated with Pitt for years with little done by the
university over that time to ease problem. —

Aside from the errection of a few non-university
parking garages, the parking situation has remained
at its present unbearable level for the past several
years. ' I

We don’t agree with the city meter maid represen-
tative"s comments concerning Pitt students filling
city parking spaces that might otherwise be used by
persons visiting area hospitals or attending cultural
events. Pitt students have just as much right to fight
for, and grab, those spaces as anyone else when such
spaces are available.’ . v

Our sympathy rests with thoseiunknowing souls
who venture to Oakland unaware of the parking
nightmares that will befall them. For those visiting
any one of the University Medical Center hospitals,
attending a cultural event at the Syria Mosque,
Carnegie Music Hall, or Soldiers and Sailors, Hall,
theheadache of finding a parking place within hiking
distance of their ultimate destination may be enough
to dissuade them from ever attending such an event
in the Steel City again.

Oakland is rich in educational,‘ cultural, shopping
and entertainment centers. But what good are these
establishments if people must circle the area for
hours to find a nearby, safe parking place.

The current parking mess has and will in the future . _

undoutedley cost the the city, private Oakland-based
organizations and the university countless dollars.

There are few people who derive pleasure from
driving around the block for 45 minutes only to find

-a single narrow parking spot located on a dimly lit
street a mile from where they are going.

There is certainly little joy in that.

And the university, faced with drastic drops in
enrollment during the eighties stands only to lose
even more students if it cannot do something to make
Pitt a more attractive commuter institution.

But where does the sole responsibility for ending
this monstrous parking headache rest? With the city?

‘With the university? _ _

' Since this is a problem that affects everyone who
"works, lives and studies in the Oakland area, and will
adversely affect the revenue of both the city and the
university, we believe it should be a joint effort of
both to brighten this grim picture.

By pooling the resources of both the city and the

university, surely something can be done to ease the
path travelled by thousands of Pittsburghers each

’ day.

If nothing is done,_'Oakland stands a good chance
of becoming the city’s best kept cultural and educa-
tional secret.

Dear Mama:

As you well know‘, I have been
running what many people in the
press call a “mean” campaign. I
decided, or should I say my cam-
paign advisers have said, that I.can
no longer with a second term office
herein the White House if I con-
tinue to tell the American people
things that may not necessarily be
true about Ronald Regan. On
Wednesday, I told Barbara Walters
that the personal attacks would
stop. It really hurt to say that I
would stop getting on Ronnie’s
case, the way I used to get on kids
when I was growing up in Plains.

Dear "Morn,

 
 

 

An old friend came into town,
and I took him to eat at the Grand
Concourse where we ordered two-
for-one lobster. When our order
came, we each got two lobsters, and
we were too embarrassed to point

- the mistake out to the waitress,
fearing that the mistake was pro- -

bably ours. We each paid $16 in-
stead of $16 together.

talking abouttheir family tree, but I
always did it in a spirit of fun and
charity. At any rate, for the last
three weeks or so of the campaign, I
will stick to,,Ronie’s, record as.
govemer of California, i and keep
the innuendos at a bare minimum.
Well, you know what I mean.

. nthers to Meet Toughest Foe Yet

By JEFF nunosxo

Pitt News Sports Editor
Defense will be the name of the
game and Pitt and Florida State will

‘be the teams providingithe power

tomorrow night when the Panthers
travel to Tallahassee for what
should prove to be the toughest
game of the young seasonfor Pitt.

3 According to this week’s NCAA
statistics, the Panther defense is
ranked second in the country
against the rush, (31.0 yards per

- game), third against scoring (5.0

points per game) and fourth in total

A defense (177.7 yards per game).

The Seminoles are close behind as
they are fifth against scoring (6.2
points per game), ninth in total
defense (211.2 yards per game) and
14th against the rush (99.0 yards per
game): And Florida State isn’t even
undefeated.

The Seminoles are 4-1, having
defeated Lousiana State (16-0),
Louisville (52-0), East Carolina

,(63-7) and last week’s surprising win

over highly regarded Nebraska
(18-14). FSU lost to undefeated
and 13th ranked Miami of Florida
10-9 two weeks ago. Miami won
the game on‘ a touchdown that was
set up with an interference call in
the endzone. ‘

“Their defense is awfully quick,”
said coach Jackie Sherrill. “They
have, by far, the quickest defense
we've" played. Their defensive
schemes are very similar to ours.

V -They have a damn good football

team.”

Florida State’s big man is All-
America noseguard Ron Simmons.
The 6-1, 242 pound senior sat out
the first two games but has been
playing the last couple weeks. He
played a half game against Miami
and about 80 percent of the
Nebraska game. Though he will
probably play a full game against
Pitt, he will still not be playing at
Seminole fans put
Simmons in the same category with
Panther Hugh Green.

The rest of the FSU defense
stacks up well with the Pitt D-men.
Linebacker Paul Piurowski, (6-3,
220) leads the Seminole team in
tackles with 84. He is followed by
senior linebacker Reggie ‘Herring
(6-1, 215), who has 70.‘ Piurowski
had 22 tackles against Nebraska
and saved the Seminole win with a
big tackle on the three-yard line
with 10 seconds remaining to play.

Qn the Pitt side of the field, the

Panthers will be playing without the

services of strong safety" Carlton

Williamson and left cornerback
Terry White. According to Sherrill,

the two seniorsqhave not practiced
this week and “it looks like they
probably won’t play.”

However, the Panthers will be
playing with Green. He leads the

Panther defense with 39 tackles and

six quarterback sacks and Ricky
Jackson -is right behind Green with

Led_by Jerry_Boyarsky (no. 68) and Ricky Jackson (no. 87), Pitt’s defensive unit will be the key
against Florida State if the Panthers are torremain undefeated.

,

36 tackles and four sacks. Middle
guard Jerry’Boyarski is third on the
defensive list with 26 tackles and
one sack while Sal Sunseri is fourth
with 24 tackles. ‘

While much of tomorrow’s game
will be played by the defensive
squads, each team has an excellent
offensive unit. The Pitt passing
game is ranked fifth in the country.

Panther passers have completed
75 of 149 attempts for 1,067 yards
which averages out to 266.7 yards
per game. Panther quarterback has
completed 65 of 130 attempts for
893 yards and‘l0 touchdowns.

The Florida St_ate ground game is
led by/tailback Sam Platt who has
carried the ball 100 times for 387
yards and three touchdowns. FSU
quarterback Rick Stockstill has
completed 58 of 89 passes for 618
yards and five touchdowns.

“We're working very hard
preparing for Florida State,” Sher-
rill said yesterday. * “They are an ex-
cellent team. Their kicking game is -
probably the best we've played and
maybe the best wefll play this
year,” .

Sherrill said he feels , the
Seminoles will be putting the ball in
the air for most of the game tomor-
row.

“They’ve been opening up offen-

sively little by -little each week,” the
coach said, “and I’m sure with our
young men down in the secondary,
they'll put the ball up quite a bit.”

PITI‘ NOTES: Florida State is
favored by one point, making this
the first game of the season in
which the Panthers are thefunder-

natural turf., .

Women Spikers Prepare for Texasishowdovvn

Pitt News Sports Writer

This weekend the Pantherette
Volleyball team is looking for na-
tional recognition as they enter their
toughest competition\Qf the season,
the 14th annual Houston Invita-
tional Volleyball Tournament. ,

“This tournament will reflect
how we stand in the national
volleyball scene,” Pitt coach
Shelton Collier said. “We’ve

 

ode,“

‘ established ourselves as the number

one team in the east, and this will be
our first experience playing stronger
nationally ranked teams from other
regions.”

The Pantherettes open on Thurs-
day evening against Texas, and
follow with matches against Texas
Arlington, and Tulane on Friday.

“Our team has been looking for-
ward to the challenge of playing
some of these Texas teams,” Collier
said. “We’ve had that in the back
of our minds this week in practice.”

Texas is, according to Collier,
probably the second strongest
region in the country next to
California. Playing against Texas
and Texas Arlington pose a variety
of tactical problems. ‘

“Texas is a very strong team,”
Collier said, and they use a very,
very high set that is unique in
volleyball.”

When ateam recieves a serve it is
allowed three contacts to get the
ball over the net. The setter is a
centrally placed player who usually
makes the second contact, setting
up a play for a front line spiker. 4

“The setter puts the ball up as
close to the ceiling“ as possiuble,
which creates confusion for
blockers in the defence. It throws
off a team’s rhythm‘ because nor-
mally they’re successfull against
good teams, because normally a
squad is prepared for average high
sets and quicker attacks.”

“So, what we’ve been doing in
practice,” Collier added, “is to
work against these types of sets and
hits.” S j
S Texas Arlington, on the other
hand, offers another set of pro-
blems.- S

“They have been successful with
a combination offense,” ‘ Collier
said. ”They’ll have several at-
tackers approaching the net with
different quick plays, sets with dif-
ferent types of faking, and dif-
ferent people hitting the ball quick-

. “I’m familiar with the play-sets
they'll be using,” Collier said. “so
that we’ve been trving to set block-
ing alignments against them.”

“What we’re trying to do this
year is win with a very basic of-
fense, and fundamentals,” Collier
added. ,“Good ball handling and
good serving as opposed to complex
offenses and trickery:” A '

While Collier has characterized
his team as “well balanced,” Pitt’s
competitive edge this weekend will
depend on the qualtiy of several key
players.

“We’ll be looking to our setter, ‘

Maria Perez, to have a big
weekend.” Collier said. “Our team
kind of goes as Maria goes, when
she has an excellent match, our
team usually has an excellent
match. She contacts the second ball
every timeforius, and if. she’s not
having a good game our whole team
is thrown off.”

Among the ‘members of the
bench, sophmore
Riemersma, will be called on for her
special skills.

“She is potentially one of the top
back court players in the east,”
Collier said. “She’s an excellent
defensive player, and an excellent
server. She simply does not make
mistakes when she’s in a game.”

“We rely on her to come into.a

..game.when things are tight,” Col-

lier added,“ and make good smart
plavs.”

There was concern last week over
the injuries of spikers Linda Stadler

CORRECTION

In the October 8 issue of The
Pitt‘News, an error in the spell-
ing of a player’s name was
made. Panther tightend Mike
Dom_browski was misspelled
without the “w” in a feature ar-
ticle. We regret.the mistake.

Shelly'

and Ellen Mangus, but they are ex-
pected to play this weekend.

“We’re hoping that both of them
will be fully recovered this
weekend,” Collier said. “Ellen
bruised her hip last week, and we’re
waiting to see how serious that is,
but we’re pretty sure Stadler will be
ready.”

This weekend’s tournament is im-
portant to Pitt’s national standing,
especially their matches against the
Texas teams.

“We’re not favored to do well
in this tournament because an
eastern eight team like ours doesn't
get the regular exposure to top
teams the way Texas teams do,”
Collier said. “Our first goal is to
upset one of the two Texas teams, if

"we do that, we’ll have a good

chance of finishing in the top eight,
and if we play our best, we could do
even better.”

Generally, Collier believes that
this kind of competition will help
the team become stronger.

“The more exposure we can get
to thesestronger teams the better,”
Collier said. “With this match in

—‘ the middle of the season we can

evaluate our performance and make
adjustments for later in the
season.”

“We're very excited about this
tournament. We’re looking for-

ward to the chance to upset one of

these Texas teams.”
