Faced with diversity, Pitt
senior shares common bond

Katie Delaney
F or ‘The Pitt News

(This is the first part of an occa-
sional series on Pitt senior Katie
Delaney ’s semester in Ireland.)

I’ve been anticipating my study .

abroad experience since my
senior year of high school. In
fact, one of the reasons I chose to
study at Pitt was because I knew
from the orientation that the
Study Abroad Office provides
wonderful opportunities for edu-

cation overseas. Pitt does not
sponsor an exchange program
with the University College of
Dublin, where I studied until
Christmas; however, the universi-
ty allows me to partake in the
Beaver Collegestudy abroad pro-
gram which does sponsor a pro-
gram at UCD.

I chose to study in Ireland in
hopes of meeting distant relatives,
Fitzmaurices and Flannagans, and
thereby being able to fill in the
bare branches of the framed fami-

SGB prolongs

$ 14,663 decision

 

Tina Charkaway
For The Pitt News

The Student Government Board voted
unanimously last night to prolong its deci-
sion concerning the purchase of $14,663
worth of computer equipment for its office.

Board member Lauren Leiter motioned to
table the computer request indefinitely,
saying, “I ask that we table this until after
our student groups have had the opportuni-
ty to request funding for spring events.
This will allow us to make a decision with-
out affecting other student groups.”

Following the Allocations Committee’s
second denial, the final decision rests with
the board; The Allocations Committee is
now out of the decision process concerning
the outcome.

“The reason we are going with our rec-
ommendation [for denial] is we have to be
consistent. We simply can not afford to
supply all student groups with computers,”
said Brian Kavalukus, the allocations chair.
“It has been speculated that this cost will
be greater than the activity fees itself.”

During the open-ﬂoor discussion, student
Andy Miller commented, “I fully believe
that this a want, not a need. Furthermore, I
find personally that the SGB is not willing
to fundraise for something that they want,
such as. the computers, when you ask other
groups to do the same.”

Board member Lee Bannister stated a
need to have the system in the office.
“[There is] some speculation these services
are available in the computer lab. While
that is true for students, it is not true for
this office, for the simple reason that we
are a fully-functional and fully, staffed
office with a full-time professional secre-
tary that can not go across the street to
Hillman Library to use their computer sys-
tem.”

Because the request was tabled indefi-
nitely, the issue can be re-opened for dis-
cussion in any future meetings. Board
President Andy Wuertele ended the discus-
sion on the issue.

"We have put both the Allocations
Committee,as well as ourselves, in a diffi-
cult spot in trying to make a change, and
hopefully in a week or two we will be able
to come to a spot where we will be able to
continue.” ’

Chaplains’ Association unites Pih"s roe/igous

By Kelie Previtali
For The Pitt News

Approximately 13 . religious
groups on campus comprise
the Chaplains’ Association. It's
composed of a variety of reli-
gious organizations whose
common interest is providing
religious development to
members of various religions.

Religious organizations on
campus let students learn more
about their faith by offering
special programs and activi-
ties. The activities are
designed for students to meet
other students within their reli-

gion. Spring break trips, movie
nights and language classes
are examples of activities
offered.

Each group has its own spe-
cific goal, but the goal of the
entire association is to encour-
age students to follow their
faith.

The Islamic Center of
Pittsburgh is a member of the
Chaplains’ Association and is
affiliated with the Muslim
Student Association on cam-
pus. The Islamic Center is
located on 4100 Bigelow
Boulevard. _

“The Muslim Student

Association is a unique collec-
tion of races and cultures,”
President Abdul 'Mawjoud
said. “It is similar to the
United Nations; we are not
limited to one color.”

The Islamic Center encour-
ages participation on campus
by providing education pro-
grams. For example, an Arabic
class is offered three days a
week through the Islamic
Center. -

M__awjoud teaches a class
called Introduction to Islam
every Thursday from 7 to.9
p.m. This class is open to all
students. Basic beliefs are

taught. including the pillars of
Islam. in a relaxed environ-

ment.
There is an Internet site for
the ‘ Muslim Student

Association that provides
Islamic literature to Muslim
and non-Muslim students.
Holidays are celebrated
according to the Islamic calen-
der, which means that the days
are different each year.
“Breakfast At Sunrise“ is a
celebration marking the end of
a fasting period. which is
called the Eid of Fast-
Breaking. This is the first meal

ly tree that hangs on the
family room wall in my par-
ents’ Mechanicsburg, Pa.,
home.

So I stuffed my life (a few
outfits that could always be
washed, photographs in case
I got lonely, and plenty of
deodorant — after all, I was
going to Europe) into two
check—in bags and one
carry—on and headed to John
F. Kennedy Airport in New
York City to meet the other
50 college students from
around the United States
who were also studying
through the Beaver College
program.

Security was too tight for
anyone without a plane tick-
et to enter the airport, so at
5:30 p.m., after rushed
good—byes to my parents
and younger brother, I awk-
wardly maneuvered my
overstuffed luggage past
security and into a room
of unfamiliar faces. Some
looked exhausted. Some
seemed excited. Others
looked scared. I imagine
I looked all three, as it
suddenly occurred to me
that I was embarking on
this journey not knowing

UNTIL 1:30 A.M. I later
learned that our plane had
mechanical difficulties and
another plane had to fly
from Ireland to N.Y.C.
before we could leave the
States.

And that’s how the five-
hour bonding session of 50
American students began
almost immediately after
we arrived at J.F.K. on
Sunday, 10 September. It
was my first educational
experience, yet it was noth-
ing I could have learned
from a text book. It’s amaz-
ing the people you meet
when you’re all brought
together for the same pur-
pose.

We sat on the floor, cold
as it was, in a small section
of the airport and naturally
gravitated towards each
other. Some people -read
magazines or books while
others sparked conversa-
tions with whichever
stranger was next to them. I
decided to fill my empty
photo album with pictures
of my family, my group of
girls at Pitt and my friends
from work.

I had no idea my complet-
ed photo album would
be such a conversation
piece. Meghan, McKenna,
Virginia, Ally and three
Bridgets all gathered around
me to look at the pictures
and ask questions about
who everyone was. As
we paged through my
photo album, I shared child-
hood stories about my sib-
lings and details of how

my parents met. I even
found myself explaining
to these people, these
strangers, how my grandpar-
ents separately left behind
their farm lives in County
Galaway, Ireland during the
early 1900s in search of
prosperity in the United
States.

The idea of meeting peo-
ple for the first time and
introducing them to the

most significant people
in your life through a photo
album is bizarre. I happen
to be fanatical about pic-
tures, regardless of who’s
in them or where they’re
taken. I thought I was the
only one who could flip
through countless pages of
unfamiliar faces for hours
and like it. That’s why it
amazed me to find other
people who were interested

in seeing pictures and hear-
ing stories about people
they’ve never met. It’s com-
forting to know in a world
where human life seems to
be more devalued by the
second that there are indi-
viduals out there who are
genuinely interested in oth-
ers.

Tenuous tenure denial

You will think what we tell you to think. You will say
only what we tell you to say. You will learn only what
we believe is appropriate for you to learn. You‘will do
only what we tell you to do. And you will like it.

You’ve probably never heard anything like this in any
of your classes, and there is a good reason for it.
Universities and schools everywhere are staffed by
instructors with the most diverse range of political views
and ideas anywhere. There is no One Acceptable View
here. We have all had professors who are liberal, others
who are conservative. Nor is there one Proper Way to
Teach. We have all had lectures, discussions, readings
and labs. We have the opportunity to study virtually any-
thing we want to, whether it is neuroscience or women’s
history, geology or poetry, politics or engineering. We
are lucky enough to cover almost almost the entire range
of the spectrum, ideologically and intellectually.

One of the main reasons we are fortunate enough to
benefit from such a range of views and teaching methods
is the tenure system. Tenure is based primarily on stu-
dent opinion of an instructor and the instructor’s success
in publishing. Once a professor gains tenure, he or she is .
virtually immune from being fired except for the most
blatant ethical violations. We should all be thankful for
tenure, since a professor may not be fired for uttering a
few words contradictory to the status quo. Tenure guar-
antees that there will never be a dictate issued from a
Voice lurking inithei higher ranks regarding what we
should (and shouldn’t) be taught, or how we should be
taught it. Tenure also allows academic freedom to_rule
the intellectual marketplace without “help” from the
administration. .

There are, however, problems with the tenure system.
There must be when a professor like Sandy Kita is

, denied the opportunity to join the tenured ranks. He has

taught here for eight years, and most of his students (past
and present) hold an overwhelmingly favorable opinion
of him. He was nominated by his students for_member-
ship in Phi Eta Sigma for achievements as a teacher. He

has paibilished1e'ight_ar_ticles  12 years, has a book com-
.L‘}.'1’!lgLfoit_t‘;in’M'a_‘rch‘land _an,oth:4t‘:r accepted for publication
' 'la‘st‘-y'ear.iBut"sinCe '.his'fi"eld,;'Jap_a'nes'e art history, is rela-

tively new and partly" because some find his teaching
style unconventional, Kita has been denied tenure.

It's not supposed to happen this way. Professor Kita did
what he was supposed to do: teach and publish.

A little note to the Powers That Be: biology was new
once, and so was the study of secular literature. Learning
with computers was unheard of until 20 or so years ago,
and having a classroomtdiscussion was out of the ques-
tion once. New, different programs and methods are
evolving or erupting every day, a_nd.those_ who; arepbold
enoug_h_to explore. new areasLshoju.l,d not be penalized for
it. Kita ‘fits the criteria for being awarded tenure, and his

appeal deserves to be granted; .j '

HOW CaN We

  

FROM ‘VH6.

“Here is wisdom. Let him
who has understanding calculate
the number of the beast, for it is
the number of a man: His num-
ber is 666.” -This ominous
excerpt from Revelation is sup-
posedly a prophecy of the things
to come. It is obviously a puzzle
of some sort, a code.

Now let’s pretend we are
objective observers reading
Revelation for the ﬁrst time. Our

first-inclination_'vis— that lohn had
i been licking the wrong kind of
' stamps. However, small parts of

this book are actually clear — in
particular, the purpose of the
beast and his “mark.” This sup-
posed beast will wield great
power, and, among other things,
will force all of humanity to
receive this mark. What also is
very clear, yet what most people
don’t realize, is the reason for

7 this mark. Everyone will receive

a mark “that nonemay buy or

’ sell except the one who has the

mark.” That is, it is intended to
facilitate some sort of new
worldwide economic system. ‘
Now let’s consider the future
of our economic system.
Financial transactions are on the
verge of undergoing revolution-
ary changes, changes which look
ominously similar to the picture
painted by this trippin’ prophet
nearly 2000 years ago. Debit
cards are replacing cash as pre-

ferred payment throughout the.

world. Worldwide banks are
even now making plans for a

more holistic system of com- '

merce —— full Internet transac-
tions. In the future, most transac-
tions will take place via data
encryption over the Intemet.

' Furthennore, many state gov-
ernments have begun storing
computer-coded information
about residents on their driver’s
licenses. The next step in this
system is obvious. All identiﬁca-

on a single card which will
replace cash, credit cards, video

" rental cards, etc. Obviously,

everyone will need one of these
cards to buy or sell anything. I

am conﬁdent that this will be the
future of financial transactions;
there is no stopping it. But why

stop there? The only problem i
‘ with these cards would be theft

and rnisplacement. This problem
could be resolved finally by the
injection of a bio-implant at birth
that takes the place of the card, a
birth “mark” if you will.
Hypothetically, now, if we
were to try to ﬁnd the best candi-
date for this beastly person, who
might we choose? Well, as this
person should have incredible

.socio-economic power, we

might be inclined to look at the
world’s wealthiest person. You

may recognize him: He is‘Bill _

Gates III, CEO of the world’s
most ubiquitous computer soft-

ware corporation, Microsoft

(MS). You probably know that
last year MS released Windows
95 and arguably revolutionized
the proliferation of worldwide
computer use in the process.
You may also know that each
copy of Windows 95 came with
the software for MSNetwork
(MSN). In fact, MS threatened
to sweep the Internet access
providers’ industry with this
slick little package because of

the simplicity of pressing a sin- »

gle button to get Intemet access.
This simplicity is precisely what
many need in order to get started
on the Internet.

Consider this: If just 10 per-
cent of the expected 30 million
Windows 95 consumers decide
to push that persistent little MSN
button,‘then MSN will have
more customers in its ﬁrst year
that Prodigy and AOL combined

have amassed in nearly a
decade.

Furthermore, in October 1994,
MS swallowed Intuit Corp., the
maker of the world’s most popu-
lar check-writing and tax-prep
software with the Internet to lead

the development of the electron— '

ic commerce over MSN. A
quote by an MS executive: “We
will put in the systems and struc-

. turss -to snabls elestronic
I merce to ﬂourish in the next mil-

lennium.” Gates himself has
mentioned in interviews his
vision of the “virtual wallet,”
which will essentially be a wal-
let-sized computer that replaces
and adds to every function that a
wallet serves. Sound familiar?
Make the wallet a little smaller,
I stick that sucker in your fore-
head, and your name is “Mark.”
So I’ve suggested the most
natural candidate for the sup-
posed“‘beast-” by looking at the
world’s wealthiest man, and I
have revealed that coincidentally
the same man will be the driving
force behind revolutionizing the
world’s system of commerce in
a manner that is ominously simi-
lar to that described in
Revelation. Computer technolo-
gy will play the central role in
thi_s rex olution. Finally. in com-
puter programming. the most
obvious way to convert a string
of characters to numbers is by
using the ASCII code —— the
worldwide standard code used
by computers to decipher char-
acters. (This is where you start to
wonder if you have been licking
stamps.) If you add up the
ASCII numbers for each charac-

' ter in BILLGATES you will get

663. Sure, that’s three short of
666; however. he is Bill Gates
III! Tack on an extra three for
“the third” and you get exactly
666, the number of the beast!

Men end slide, beat Seton Hall 75-69

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team killed a five-game losing
streak with solid play down the stretch in a 75-69 victory
over Seton Hall last night at Fitzgerald Field House.

The team, criticized recently for poor play at the end of
games against UMass and UConn, thwarted a late rally by

The Pitt gymnastic team
broke the top, 25 in the
National NCAA poll. A second
place finish, however, may
change the placement. Last
weekend, Pitt" earned 187.425
points to the University of New
Hampshire’s 189.25 points.

“This time of year that poll is
very volatile,” Coach Debbie
Yohman said. “After the first
six meets it settles down and
will be based on averages.”
Currently the poll ranks
schools based on total points.
“We were also ranked number
six on floor,”'Yohman said.

The team earned that rating
without senior competitor
Brenda Stevens and freshman
Janet Highhill. “She [Highhill]
should be one of our top ﬂoor
competitors,” Yohman said.

the Pirates to pull away with the contest, despite a game-high
32-point performance from the Hall’s Adrian Griffin.

“We lost games in those five-minute stretches,” said Pitt
point guard Jerry McCullough, who scored 15 points while
only turning over the ball once. “Tonight we were able to get
some of those loose balls and rebounds that made the differ-
encef’

After McCullough fed Chad Varga, who had a team—high
19 points and 10 rebounds, for an easy layup with 6:29 left
in the game, Pitt held a commanding 64-51 lead.

After that, Pitt had one of those two-minute stretches.

Seton Hall went on a 9-0 run over the next 2:11 to trim
Pitt’s lead to 64-60 with 4:00 to go. The run was sparked by
the play of Pirate point guard Danny Hurley, who had been
absent for most of the game, apparently rattled by the contin-
ual barking of the sparse student section.

Pirate Head Coach George Blaney said of his floor general,
“He came on -strong towards the end and got 14 points late
and made some big shots at the end.”

But Pitt center Gerald Jordan, who scored ll points and
grabbed 11 boards before fouling out, made the biggest shot
of the game- '

After a Panther miss, Jordan snagged the ball and netted
two points to end the Hall’s run and give Pitt a 66-60 lead.

Pitt sealed the game at the line with some clutch foul-
shooting to give Head Coach Ralph Willard his 100th career
victory. I . —

Willard chose not to focus on his achievement, but rather
focused on the new look of the Panthers, who had guard
Vonteego Cummings back for the first time in four weeks.
Plus, forward Michael Gill earned his first collegiate start.

“We weren’t getting any rebounding from our three-spot,”
Willard said. “We put Michael in there, and he did a nice job,
getting eight rebounds and playing solid defensively.”

Gill turned in his best performance in an injury—pl‘agued
freshman season, scoring 12 points and contributing in every
facet of the game. ' .

Nothingbetter describes his play then this. sequence.

With 3:12 left in the first half, Gill got an offensive‘ board,
put the ball in the bucket, was fouled, missed the foul shot,
chased down the loose ball, got fouled again and fdrained
both free throws.

Gill tried to keep things cool when Willard told him that
his first collegiate start would bein front of a national TV
audience.

_ “The coach told me to come out and do some of the small
things well,” Gill said. “It just feels good to go out there

healthy, to be 100 percent.
And when the coach came
and told me that I was start-
ing, I was like, ‘Oh yeah?’
You know, trying not to act
surprised.”

According to the team and
coaching staff, the Panthers
were able to do things that
they were not accomplishing
during the losing streak.
Willard said, “We did a good
job offensively. We had 20
assists for the first time in a
Big East game.”

Willard had been com-
plaining about the inside-
outside game during the los-
ing streak. but Varga thinks
the Panthers turned things
around last night.

“This week during prac-
tice, Coach charted our ball
reversal,” Varga said.
“During the UConn game,
we couldn’t get shots. Our
guards did a good job of that
today.”

Pitt managed to make 29

of 66 shots (44 percent) for g

the game, against a physical
Pirate defense that blocked
nine Panther shots. Pitt,
however, outmuscled the
Hall on the boards, with a
46-32 advantage.
Pitt pulled down l9 offen-
sive boards.

“Our rebounding was
sorry,” Blaney said.

The play of Griffin was .

anything but sorry. His 32
points came on a 15-of-23
shooting performance from
the field. Griffin continually
froze Pitt’s defense with hes-
itation moves and by pre-
tending to take the long shot.

“Griffin should be right up
there with the top players in
the conference,” Willard
said. “It’s impossible to stop
him.”

The win raises Pitt’s

record to 9-8 (4-5 in the Big

East). Next, the Panthers
travel to conference foe
Villanova for a nationally
televised game Saturday on
NBC. Tipoff is scheduled for
4 p.m.
