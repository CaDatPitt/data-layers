Assistant News Editor _

This past week's Homecom-

despite a few problems, ac-
cording to Craig Jackson,
chairman of the Student Rela-
tions Committee. 8

Lynne Yancich and Mike
Dorn were crowned as Pitt's
royal Homecoming couple for
the next year.

Thirty—two teams entered the
Keg Roll this year, with teams
from Delta Tau Delta and the
Society of Nurses Association
of Pennsylvania taking the
firs_t-place trophies.

”Nobody knows how long
it's [the Keg Roll] been going
on," said Jackson. ”lt’s been
going on for God knows how
long with the same events ev-
ery year. Nobody knows how
it got started; it's a tradition

— now.”

Keg Roll events consist of
first rolling a keg with a
broom, running through five
tires, shaving whipped cream
off a teammate’s face with a
tongue depressor, passing a
balloon with your knees,

ing festivities were a success, ’

PPC pleased with
1987 Homecoming 

jumping rope, eating a whole
banana, throwing an egg into
a bucket tied around a team-

mates neck, sack hopping for _

a few yards and rolling
another keg across the finish
line.

The Homecoming parade,
which took place Saturday
morning at 10:30, was not
very successful, according to
Jackson. _

”We had a very poor tur-
nout this year,” Jackson said.
”We had it before the game
this year, hoping that the
alumni would show up.”

Jackson said the Homecom-

* ing formal aboard the Liberty

Bell was a success. ‘.

”Everyone had fun; they
were dancing and enjoying
themselves,” Jackson said. ”It
was great.” 

”l thought/the whole day
[Saturday] went really‘ well,"

'Jackson said”! spent the last
six months praying for good
weather for Friday and Satur-
day, and it paid off. We
couldn't have‘ had better
weather for Friday and
Saturday.” _

Pittsburgh ‘surgeons trans-
planted a |iver,—pancreas and
part of a stomach and intestine
Sunday into a 3-year-old girl
who has never eaten solid
food because of a deadly
defect in her digestive system.

Doctors said that without
the experimental surgery,
Tabath_a Foster of Madison-
ville, Ky., would have died
within weeks.

The operation began at T0
p.m. Saturday and ended near-
ly 15' hours later at 12:45 p.m.
Sunday, said Lynn McMa_hon,
spokeswoman for Children's
Hospital. .

Tabatha was in the hospi-
ta|’s intensive care unit in crit-
ical condition, which is
normal following transplant
operations, McMahon said.

”The information we've
received is that the surgeons

are very pleased ‘with the sur-’ ’
, gery and feel it went very

3-year-old treated
with new surgery

smoothly,” McMahon said.

She said Tabatha probably
would remain unconscious
Sunday ‘and doctors would
watch her closely for signs of
rejection and to ensure that
the organs were functioning
properly.

Similar‘ transplants have
been performed only twice,
and the patients died, said Sue
Cardillo, another hospital
spokeswoman.

”There are risks involved
technically in terms of making
the connections with the trans-
planted organs to the
recipients, and there are
dangers associated with rejec-
tion,” 'McMahon said. ”Since
this procedure hasn't been
done many times before, phy-
sicians themselves aren't sure
what all the risks might be.”

Tabatha was born with short
gut syndrome, a fatal condi- .
tion in which her twisted intes-
tines. interfered with blood
circulation. 

 

 

  

 

Officials tackle homeless issue

By, Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — State officials
display uncommon unity in voic-
ing concern for the homeless, but
thedifficult task of identifying
and tracking those in" need has
complicated efforts to provide
housing, jobs and medicalcare.

Some sources say about
60,000 people in Pennsylvania
are homeless each year. But,

other than sweeping estimates,”

little precise information tells

who they are, where they come '

from or what their needs are.
”Everyone seems to agree
homelessness is on the increase,
but it's hard to pinpoint a num-
ber. lt’s hard to track them
down," said Vicki Smink, a
spokeswoman for the state
Department of Public Welfare.
”|t’s such a new area, we're just
starting to collect data on this.
Everywhere I look, it's different
numbers," Smink added.
Homelessness, long viewed as
a problem particular to urban
sprawls, has -become” in .recent
years an issue of national promi-

 

 
   

,t,he_;m. . —

divorcees, children and others,
officials say. . A

”Some days I'm not sure that
homelessness isn't a synonym for
poverty or joblessness,” said
Phyllis Ryan of the Pennsylvania
Coalition for the Homeless.

In response, the Casey adminis-
tration sharply increased state
funding for homeless programs,
boosting the appropriation for fis-
cal l987—88 some 60 percent
over the previous year — now

totaling more than $14 million. V

In addition, several new "hous-
i_ng and assistance programs for
the homeless are being launched.

Gov. Robert P. Casey has said
the administration ”is committed
to solving the serious problems of
the homeless in Pennsylvania."

But Smink said while there is a
ready supply of state and local

money to aid the homeless, and .

nearly 8,000 beds in state-run

shelters to house them, officials _,

are still struggling to define th
makeup and needs of the home-
less population. - . ‘

She said workers are _often_

”frustrated”‘by the ‘difficultly in
tracking the homeless and with
the paucity of_ informationf_.o___n

place the number of homeless
people between 40,000 and
60,000 annually, there is no in-
formation on ages, gender or
backgrounds.

Sminksaidthe state is awaiting
completion of a study by the

Pennsylvania Coalition on the-
‘ Homeless, which is expected to
shed new light on homeless

problems in the state.
Additionally, an $800,000 pro-

gram is in the works to develop‘ '

a case-management program for
the homeless that will ”try to get
them back to be a self-"sufficient

adult [and] develop some type of

plan for them,” Smink said.
Also, Rep. Michael Dawida, D-

Allegheny, plans to introduce "a

comprehensive legislative pack-

age on the homeless in early ‘

November. .
”Homelessness deals with so

many. issues — housing, mental. -

health, welfare, -abused people —
it has to be done in a comprehen-
sive way," said Dawida.

cans have both supported pro-e M.

Carluccisays we're ’98 percent there’ on INF

 

WASHINGTON — National
security adviser Frank C. Carluc-
ci said Sunday that a U.S.-Soviet
accord on intermediate-range
nuclear missiles is "98 percent of
the way there” and ‘predicted

Senate ratification.

However, a leading Senate
Democrat warned that the super-
power pact could be doomed if
conservative Republicans tamper
with it by attaching amendments
on issues like the Soviet occupa-
tion of Afghanistan.

‘'1 do think that there could be
problems," said Sen. Alan Cran-
ston, D-Ca|if., the Senate
Democratic whip who is also a
member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the
Select Committee on Intelligence.

”There are 15-20 very conser-
vative Republican senators who
I think are very likely to take on
the’ treaty directly, and I think
there are others who might take
it on by indirection. . . They
might well suggest various reser-
vations or amendments that
would, in effect, kill it,” Cranston
said on NBC-TV’s Meet the Press.

Sen. Richard Lugar, a leading
Republican and a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, also predicted some
tough sailing in the Senate for an
INF treaty.

’’I think there are a number of
Republican senators, and [there
will] be a few Democrats who are
not in favor of any treaty with the
Soviet Union, feel it's unverifia-
ble, unenforceable,” the Indiana
Republican said on ABC-TV's
This Week with David Brinkley.

Babbitt and son OK
after scary car crash

PHOENIX, Ariz. — Democrat-
ic presidential hopeful Bruce
Babbitt and his son escaped seri-
ous injury, but their car was de-
stroyed when a motorist
rear-ended the auto, and it hit a
car in front.

Babbitt,.49, suffered possible
whiplash, said campaign spokes-
man Vada Manager. No one else
in Saturday's three-car accident
reported any injuries.

and his son Christopher, 12, were".

heading to play basketball at a
hotel health club when a van
with rain-soaked brakes collided
with the rear of Babbitt’s '1977
Buick LeSabre, Manager said.

Babbitt’s car then hit a vehicle
in front of it that contained an ac-
quaintance, Phil Weeks, who
also was going to the health club,
Manager said.

Babbitt, a lawyer himself,
called the ”best lawyer in Phoe-
nix,” his wife, Hattie, after the ac-
cident, Manager said.

Both Babbitt and his son were
wearing seatbelts, the spokesman
said.

  Murphy probe will be

open to the public

WASHINGTON —— Although
the House Ethics Committee does
most of its work behind closed
doors, it is likely to open to the

THE PITI’ NEws, Monday, November 2, 1987

public its disciplinary hearing
next month of U.S. Rep. Austin
Murphy.

Murphy, a six—term south-
western Pennsylvania Democrat,
will answer charges on Nov. 17
that he permitted a House col-
league to ‘vote in his name and
that he diverted congressional
resources to his law firm and put
friend and associate Michael Cor-
bett on the payroll even though
Corbett did little work.

Committee officials said they
would likely agree to any request
Murphy might make to bar the

‘press and public from the hear-

ing, which was recently shifted
from Nov. 5 to Nov. 17 to ac-
commodate attorneys’ schedules.

But Stanley M. Brand, Mur-
phy’s attorney, said in an inter-
view Friday that he saw no
reason to hold the hearing in
private.

hard—core pornography — a
$300,000 campaign including
billboards, a newspaper insert

and a TV program — have been I

fired in» Kansas City by activists
who say their target is de-
humanizing and dangerous.

Their critics, however, say the
group is using scare tactics and
exaggerating the problem to
arouse the public, and they raise
the specter of censorship down
the road.

The anti"-porn drive was a test,
organizers said. A national group
may take the campaign through-
out the country, depending on its
evaluation of the Kansas City
effort.

The campaign launched over
the past month by the National
Coalition Against Pornography
and its local affiliate urged peo-
ple to Stand Together Opposing
Pornography, or STOP. It fea-
tured 80 billboards, a two-hour
television program, direct mail
pleas, a 12-page newspaper insert
anda phone bank to take calls
from financial contributors.

MOSCOW — U.S. officials say
they are surprised and intrigued
by a rare public airing of differ-
ences between Cuba and its prin-
cipal ally, the Soviet Union, over
Cuba's economic policies.

, The two countries have been
on intimate terms for most of the

I _ past two decades, and the differ-

ences generally have been subtle,
discernible only to "seasoned
analysts.

American experts on Soviet-
Cuban relations have long sus-
pected that Moscow is displeased
with Cuba’s economic perfor-
mance, and that impression was

. borne out by an article in late Au-

gust in the Soviet New Times

, magazine.

The article, written by staff
reporter Vladislav Chirkov,
chides Cuba for excessive
defense spending, non-
repayment of foreign debts, con-
tinued rationing of food, inade-
quate housing and -other
perceived deficiencies.

Although the criticism was ex-

_ pressed in moderate terms, sever-

al  oificials, all of whom
insisted on anonymity, voiced
surprise that such an article could

‘ appear in a publication such as

the News Times, which is
described as ”fairly authoritative”
and very influential.

Equally surprising to these
analysts was the Cuban response,
which appeared in a recent edi-
tion of the same publication. It
was written by Cuban Vice Presi-
dent Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and
contained some unusually acid
comments.

Business was booming in this

dusty honky-tonk town 50 miles

to be communist rebels killed
three Americans and a Filipino in
a series of coordinated attacks.

A U.S. Air Force captain es-

Before the attacks, Clark was

‘ banned non-essential

U.S. troops, civilian employees

Filipino customers or on a hand-
ful of armed U.S. soldiers al-

Radiation poison in
Brazil causes a stir

ANGRA DOS REIS, Brazil -
The radiation poisoning of more
than 200 people has raised seri-
ous questions about the govern-
ment’s ability to control its
ambitious nuclear program,
which includes the technology
for atomic weapons.

This vast nation of 138 million
people has one atomic power
plant on line — in the quiet fish-
ing community of Angra dos Reis
— and two more planned. But it
has no site for safely disposing of
nuclear waste.

The navy minister has an-
nounced plans to make fuel for
atomic submarines, even though
Brazil doesn't have any nuclear-
powered subs.

France is having own
’lrangate’ arms muck

PARIS — A scandal that‘ some
reports are calling the French
lrangate is brewing over the sale
of munitions to Iran by a French
arms manufacturer with the al-
leged complicity of high Defense
Ministry officials.

According to articles published '

over the weekend in the local
press, an investigating magistrate

in Paris is seeking to have a‘
Defense Ministry report on the
sales d.eclassified so charges can
be brought against several
people. -

What is known as the
”Luchaire Affair” involves the’
clandestine delivery of 450,000
artillery shells to Iran between
1983 and 1986 under the so-
cialist government of Premier
Laurent Fabius.

Reports in two weekly news
magazines implicate high-
ranking officials in the office of
former Defense Minister Charles

Hernu and say that even Presi- A

dent Francois Mitterrand-knew
about the sales, which contra-
vened a government embargo on
shipments to Iran.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 2, 1987

T/irgin lies and no

Q: The guys were all on my
case about being a virgin at 17,
and they knew’! had a date with
this girl at the beach. Nothing
happened on the date, but to shut
the guys up, I told them that I did
have sex with her. Now I am
afraid she will hear that I lied
about her and me, and it worries
me sick. Also, I am afraid to have
the guys learn that nothing hap-
pened, and I am still a virgin.

A: You have to do something
that is hard to do, but you have
to do it, and it will be easier than
going on in your present state of
anxiety. Also, it will be fairerto
the girl. You have to comeiclean.
Never mind the short—term em-
barrassment this may mean.
Maybe your face will get red —
that is not fatal. Everybody has to
face that red face or feel the heat
of it anyway at some time. .With
experience, you learn to face it
right away and get things cleared

DR. RUTH

WESTHEIMER

up. I know a lot about that.

I am supposed to be a sex ex-
pert, but in the first printing of
one of my books, there was a
mistake through misprinting or
someone having a blind spot
while editing the book. It makes
no difference who made that mis-
take because I was responsible
for that book and for any mistakes

_ in it. An author is someone who
’ makes his or her mistakes in pub-

lic, right? And you have to clear
it up in public, red face or not. In
the second printing, there was a
correction —— and the cover was
red to represent my red face! This
was a mistake no sex therapist
should make, believe me.

But better to have it corrected

‘and prevent that bad information

going any further than it had to.’
Now, my friend, what I did you
can do, even at 17. I was learn-
ing this lesson about owning up

to mistakes by your age, and now
it is your turn. Whatever you feel
about 'fessing up, let this strength-
en you. You will be doing the
right thing, and your friends will
know this. Even your enemies, if
you have some, will know this is
true in their hearts. So you do
have to say that you told that lie
because you: were embarrassed,
and now you are embarrassed
even more, but you want to stop
anyharm you may have done.

To err is human, but to own up
to one’s own error is to be a
Mensch. You know that word? It
is Yiddish, meaning a real person,
someone-who is genuine, with
heart and courage to live up to his
feelings and beliefs. You will not
lose all your friends nor all the
respect you have piled up in life.
For one, you know that Dr. Ruth
respects you when you do this,
and. l assure you that I won't be
the only one. Besides my respect,
you will have your own self-
respect back, and other people
will not be so dumb as not to see
that you have done the right
thing.

The question is, how do you

‘ correct that bad story you put

out? You don't have to do like me
and get on the radio and do it. In
fact, the fewer people you have
to tell the better for that girl's
reputation because if you spread
the story further by trying to cor-
rect it, that does not help her at
all. Maybe the guys you told are
just a few friends, and it hasn't
gone beyond them. I would, in
that case, be sure you tell those
guys. Let them kid you if they

‘want to.

|f—it ever seems the story has
gone beyond those few friends,
then you will have to tell the girl.
It will be best if you tell her be-
fore other people get to her with
the ‘story. Then she will know
what to say —— that you lied out
of_ vanity, and then you were
ashamed and admitted it was just
a story. And if they don't believe
her, they can ask you, only. she
would hope that they just take

Two days after birth, surgeons
removed a major portion of her
small intestine, McMahon said.
The operation corrected the
blood flow problem but necessi-
tated a highly concentrated nutri-
tious feeding that in turn led to
liver disease, she said.

The transplant became possible
when theparents of an infant
who died after an automobile ac-

cident in Virginia agreed to
donate their daughter's organs,
said Marty Walker, senior coor-
dinator for the Knoxville Organ
Donor Program in Tennessee.

Tabatha’s parents, who con-
sented to the transplant Tuesday,
spent the night at the hospital
with friends, McMahon said.

«They declined to comment on

Tabatha’s mother, Sandra, has
said she and her husband, Roy,
decided to allow the surgery to
give her daughter a second
chance. Foster said Tabatha, her
only child; had spent all but two
months of her life in hospitals.

Although Tabatha needed only
a small intestine and liver to sur-
vive, it was easier for surgeons to
also transplant the pancreas and
part of the stomach and large in-

i , testine, McMahon said.

”The abdominal organs are so
intricately connected that for
technical reasons it's easier to just
do the transplant in one piece,”
she said.

The two similar transplants

‘were performed at Children's

Hospital in 1983 and at Rush-

‘ Presbyterian—St. Luke's Medical
‘Center in Chicago lastyear.

"Walker said the donor was
7‘/2—week—old Heather Orick of
Pennington Gap, Va., who was
declared brain dead Saturday af-
ternoon as a result of head inju-

_ries she suffered in an Oct. 9
accident, Walker said.

After the accident, Heather was
moved to the University of Ten-

. nessee Medical Center at Knox-

ville, where Walker said her brain
function began failing.

The infant's parents, Rebecca
Orick and Earl Shirks, decided
Saturday afternoon to donate the
organs,

Jackson added that a major dis-
appointment with this year's
Homecoming schedule involved
the scavenger hunt. Six people
comprising two teams were the
only participants in the competi-
tion which had expected five to
10 teams. .

The scavenger hunt featured
riddles and puzzles, placed in
Oakland businesses, that teams
had to collect and solve in order
to win. A team representing the

‘BAS took first place.

Julie Shepard, coordinator of
the scavenger hunt, said that she
felt a major problem with the
scavenger hunt was that it need-
ed more time to build up support
among the student body.

"I just wish the alumni would
have supported us more,” said
Jackson. ”We went out and got
group-rate discounts at hotels and
on airlines, but they just didn't
show up like we hoped they
would. We've got to have better
contact with the alumni through
the Alumni Development Office,
so that we can plan events like
this better.”

Jackson's experience
a presidential plus

SGB presidential candidates Craig Jackson and Robert Red-
dy have each proposed a way to make the university a" more
viable environment for students. ‘ -

However, as in any political contest, the opinions, ideolo-
gies and proposals of one candidate stand outfrom the other.

While Jackson and Reddy have confronted relevant issues
such as communication ‘between administration, faculty and
students, and the lack of sufficient access to computers, Jack-
son clearly has a better understanding of the operation and pur-
pose of SGB.

His practical experience stems from his involvement in many
campus organizations, such as chairing the Student Relations

Committee and his active membership in the Pitt Program

Council.

Jackson has been also been more specific in pinpointing-

problems which exist, and —— in his analysis — has taken a.
stronger position on how to approach solving them. It is our
hope Jackson be elected SGB president.

While there are 10 candidates seeking the eight board posi-
tions, we feel two of the candidates are exceptional — Curt Toll

and Matt Pritt.

Toll, like Jackson, has a practical advantage overmost of the
other candidates due to his experience working closely with
the SGB as Chairman of the Governmental Relations Commit-
tee and as a member of the Student Relations Committee.

Also of particular interest in this campaign is Pritt. Though
only a freshman, Pritt has shown enough initiative and insight

to provide a fresh perspective to the SGB.

We also endorse Kent Baldauf, Nan Beal, Daryl Grecich,
Tanya Jackson, Pam Rich and Jonathan Scanlon.

Taking place on a Saturday,
with a clear sky and warm tem-
perature, Halloween this year
was a definite departure from the
cold and rainy days of merrymak-
ing and masquerading I remem-
ber from my childhood. And
because it was a gorgeous day, I
decided to takexa drive out to see
my family, armed with a few
overdue hugs and handshakes
and, of course, to say BOO! to all
the little ones.

During the drive, I was treated
to regular spins of Bobby "Boris"
Pickett’s "Monster Mash" and
just about every other song that
could be even remotely connect-
ed to the ghoulish motif of the
day. Now comes the weird part.

Throughout the day's program-
ming, pseudo-concerned radio
announcers kept reminding me
about the possible dangers of
Halloween treats. These mes-
sages were followed. by informa-
tion about where to goto have

my Halloween goodies _X-rayed _
for safety's sake. Sounds like fun,

Asplendid joyride

huh? Try explaining to a tive-year-
old the "big machine” and why
it must be doing what it's doing

-to a batch of helpless candy. Nice

world we've brought our children
into.

If I could get my hands on the
psychos who started the razor-
blade-in-the-apple or pins-in-the-
candy-bar stunts, I'd force—feed
him or her their own handiwork
by the bushel. Must we all be per-
petually concerned about the
safety of our children because of

i a handful of crazies?

When I was a kid, which
wasn't long ago, we stalked the
streets on Halloween night look-
ing for a fix of sugar and perhaps
a quarter or two from neighbors
who were too lazy to buy candy
but at least knew the-going rate.
I remember having no fear of al-
tercation and, believe me,‘ to
have our candy X-rayed was the

. furthest thing from any of our

minds.
Issujppose the proliferation of

trick-or-treat X-ray’stati_ons is,-just

Showme some ID, Will ya?

The university has been doing
a lot of little things lately that
have really been ticking me off.
Not important things like raising
my tuition or not turning the heat
on in my room, but small, pica-
yune problems.

Like making me show my ID to
ride the campus bus. This is just
plain annoying because their is
little, if any, logic behind it. It
doesn't cost anything to ride the
damn thing, so why do I have to
display my ID like a bus pass? Do
they expect somebody to sneak
on the bus and get a free ride up
the hill? Would the bus driver
really wait if I had a problem with
his asking for my ID and call the
campus police? Would the cam-
pus police even come, and
would I need my ID to have them
tell the busdriver that I don't need
to show my ‘ID? '

Then there's the Student Tele-

another one of those nasty signs
of our times, further proof of the

degeneration of the collective
psyche of this country. The ques-
tions I pose are these: Is the threat
real? Or have we just become so
paranoid we're looking for
guarantees of safety at every turn?

I think perhaps it's a bit of both.

We're reacting to an increasing—,

ly bizarre and unpredictable
world. Why then shouldn't our
ways of coping with it become in-
creasingly bizarre and un-
predictable?

I found it interesting, however,
that Halloween spirit (whatever
that is) reached a crescendo of
sorts this year. I don't recall ever
seeing so many adults so in-
volved in a ‘day traditionally set
aside for the enjoyment of small

zero cents? That's right, they sent
‘a bill to my old address telling me
that I didn't owe them anything,
but when I didn't respond they
turned my access code off and
made me walk all the way to their
office just to have me confirm
that I didn't live where they
mailed my bill and that I did live
at the address that was on my ap-

plication for this year's code

third floor of OEH that I have
used for the past two years as a

It's not as if the university made
access to the hill difficult enough

I stopped into a pharmacy on
Halloween afternoon to purchase
a few personal items. When I
reached the check-out counter, to
my surprise and delight, I was
greeted by a veiled Arabian prin-
cess. I went into the barber shop
— or should I say "styling salon"
-— and had my hair trimmed by
a foot-tapping Spanish dancer,
decked-out in red with a beauty
mark placed squarely on her lip
with eye-liner. "Quienes esta
nina?" I thought, to quote
Madonna.

In the grocery "store, a clown
pointed me in the direction of the
dairy products. At the bank, a
pirate laughed and threatened a
holdup with a plastic sword.

The reason I found all of this
sort of odd is because, to me, the
whole atmosphere of playfulness
and the tolerant attitude toward
it seemed forced. People were
going out of their way to have
fun, but ‘something just wasn't
happening.’ It. wasn't gcoming"

sort of shuttle service on

weekends,_but now they haveto I

go and lock the door that ‘cuts
many useless yards out of the up

and down trek. By the way, do,

the doors open up if there's a fi re,
or do I have to go all the way
down the stairs and out the front

of the building to save myself? ‘

And what about the Student

Health Service? I've probably ’

visited them more times than any
other student at this university,

and they've never been able to . ,;:5:‘

help me on the same visit. Never.
Some nurse always listens to me

‘whine about something that's
bothering me and‘ then politely ‘

tells me I have to see a doctor.
The doctor is invariably booked

treats me like a hypochondriac.‘ ‘
Geez, the school nurse in fifth ‘

grade at least gave me a pass to

Orangemen leave Panthers singing the blues

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor A

On Halloween, it wouldn't be
surprising for a lot of strange
things to happen, but for a third-
string, freshman quarterback to
come in and play would have
been the biggest surprise of them
all. .
Pitt's Darnell Dickerson, a
freshman from Detroit and Michi-
gan's 1986 Player of the Year, en-
tered the game on the last play of
the first half.

As the Panthers lost to Syracuse

24-10 Saturday afternoon, Dick-

erson’s ‘debut was not for a win-
ning cause, but he did give the
Panthers an added boost in the
second half and showed signs of
being the Panther quarterback of
the future.

”He played well and did a lot
of good things. He got a lot of
work in practice on Thursdayand
Friday, so ,I thought he was
ready,” said Pantherhead coach
Mike Gottfried. ’’I thought we

needed-a spark, and I thought"

Darnell could give us one.” t

The Panthers could not seem to
getstarted in the first half as Syra-
cuse scoredall 24 points in the
first half. .

In the opening possession of
the game, running back. Robert
Drummond carried the ball 23
yards on the first play of the drive.

~ Two plays later, Drummond

completed a 38-yard pass to tight

end Pat Kelly. This play helped '

set up Tim Vesling’s 36-yard field
goal. .

On Syracuse's next drive, quar-
terback Don McPherson led the
way with passes to his favorite
target, Tommy Kane, for 49 and
13 yards. The drive was capped
when McPherson scored on a
3—yard run with 5:09 remaining in
the first quarter.

Things looked bleak for. the
Panthers, and to make matters
worse, Craig Heyward fumbled
on the Pitt 25-yard line, but on
the next play, McPherson fum-
bled, and Pitt linebacker Jerry
Wall recovered. But the Panthers
were unable to gain any momen-
tum and punted.

Syracuse's offense continued to
roll as the Orangemen capped a
seven-play, 80-yard drive with
McPherson, who completed
eight of 17 passes for 178 yards

A few alternate views from this
weekend's Pitt-Syracuse game:

0 Two separate games took
place at Pitt Stadium on Saturday.
The Orangemen won the first half
24-3 with a high-flying big play
offense and a crushing defense.
Pitt won the second half 7-0 with
a grinding offense and a big play
defense.

”We ‘came out the first half and,

and two touchdowns, completing
a 28-yard touchdown pass to
Kelly. .

The Panthers finally scored
with 9:14 left in the first half. Jeff
VanHorne kicked a 37-yard field
goal to close the gap to 17-3;
however, a personal foul on the
drive may have taken awaysome
of the momentum Pitt was build-
ing on the drive.

Pitt had a golden opportunity to
score on their nextrpossession.

”Right as I landed on the ground,
the guy hit me — I don't know if
it was with his helmet or not.
Later I tried to bring a play in, and
I ran halfway onto the field and

set me. I could see leaving the
game with a break, but with a
muscle bruise, I just couldn't ac-
cept that.”

0 The Panthers got a break on
their very first series of the game.
Syracuse's Outland Trophy can-
didate Ted Gregory went down
with an injury. Gregory is the best
lineman against thelrun on the
No. 1 rushing defense in the
country. Yet, Pitt couldn't take
advantage of it. -

’’It didn't matter whether he
[Gregory] played or not, we were
planning to run the ball regard-

0 The defensive hero for Syra-
cuse had to be right corner back

On Pitt's next possession, Dick-

to the Syracuse 5, but on fourth
down, Gottfried decided to go for

I the touchdown this time, but

Dickerson’s pass, intended for
Osborn, was incomplete.

”We had just missed a field
goal and were having troubles
with our field goal team. I just
thought it was a chance to get a
big score and get right back into
the game," said Gottfried.

As for Syracuse's offense,
which faltered in the second half,
Syracuse head coach Dick Mac-
Pherson Could only point the
finger at himself.

”The reason for the slowdown
of the offense in the second half
can be blamed On me. Pitt played
tremendous pressure defense,

’’I thought that we made some
super plays, and we almost hit on
two or three of those streaks. I
thought that Donnie [McPherson]
could have put a little more air On
a couple of those passes,” Mac-
Pherson added. ,

As for Dickerson’s play, Mac-
Pherson was glad to see the Pan-

 

ther freshman do so well. ”He’s

a high school quarterback who
worked his way up. I'm proud of
him. I love him. Let him play.”

PANTHER NOTES: With his
141 yards rushing against Syra-
cuse, Craig Heyward has rushed
for 100 yards in all eight games
this season. He now has rushed
for 1,061 yards this season, the
sixth—highest single-season total
in Panther history. Defensive end
Burt Crossman blocked a field
goal attempt, marking the second

thers this season. Gary Richard

The Pitt soccer team lost 1-0
Saturday in an away game at
Villanova University.

The loss puts the Panthers’
record at 3-10-1 on the season.

The only goal of the game
was- scored in the first half
when a Villanova player head-
ed the ball to the side of the
net. It bounced off the post

’ and slowly rolled into the net.

”This was the same old sto-

ry,” said Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher. ’’It was a good
game, and we played well.

_But we just couldn't put that
little extra on the ball to make

it go in.”

Pitt's best chance came later I ‘

in the game, when Mike
Grimes kicked a bullet that
bounced off both posts. But it
didn't go in. '

The Panthers play their last ,
game of the season on Tues-
day night at Indiana Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania.

the half, Gottfried inserted Dick-

erson, much to the delight of the

partisan Pitt Stadium crowd.

Judging from Dickerson’s
debut performance, he appears to
be the type of quarterback Pitt
needs. He can run and pass, a
combination that should keep op-
posing defenses from keying on
Craig ”lronhead” Heyward.

”l was a little shocked to get
the call,’’- said Dickerson. ”The
coach just told me to go in and
do the job, and I just went in.”

Pitt received theopening kick-
off in the second half, and Dick-
erson took the Panthers straight
downthe field for a touchdown.

Dickerson hit Heyward with a
seven-yard touchdown pass in
the back of the end zone, com-

. pleting a lO—play, 74-yard drive.

Pitt had. two other.seco,nd—half

scoring opportunities but failed to .

capitalize o_n either one. Pitt had

the ball first and 10 on the Syra-.

cuse 10 in the third quarter,” and

— first and 10 on the Orangemen’s

20 in the fourth quarter, but b_oth
times the Panthers turned the ball
over on downs. 9 f_

"I thi_nk that he [Dickerson]
knew" that he didn't have time to
be nervous/’.said Pitt receiver

Billy Osborn. ”l told him, this is-

no time to think of yourself as a
freshman, you have to come out
and help us win this game. He

' responded well. He justlet his
' athletic abilities take over.”

Dickerson finished the game
with eight completions in 20 at-
tempts for 76 yards, including the
touchdown pass. He also ran the
ball seven times for a total of 13
yards.

His only obvious mistake was
a poorly thrown pass on Pitt's last
possession in the fourth quarter,
which was intercepted by Syra-
cuse's David Holmes.

’’I feel that [Darnell] was ready
to handle our offense,” said Gott-
fried. ”|’ve been trying to get him
in the last three games, but the sit-
uation never showed itself. He
will play a lot from now on.”

Earlier in the week, Gottfried
hinted Dickerson still might see
action this year, by saying the
only freshman eligible for a red-
shirt, whom he would use this
late in the season, would be
Dickerson.

Dickerson came into the sea-
son as the third quarterback on
the depth chart. -

”l feel that I can play much bet-
ter,” said Dickerson. ”After the
dropped passes, I just said to my-
self that l havetopick myself up
and come back next time. Over-
all, I can do alot for the team
when I play. When I go in, they
shape the offense around me.”

”[Darnell] was much better.
than Sal,’_’ Heyward said. ”_He’s

going to be a great quarterback in»

the future. I thought it would
have been a whole different ball-

game if he had been in there the
it would have-

whole game 
been like the Notre Dame.
game,” referring to Pitt's recent
30-22 upset of the Irish.
Gottfried wouldn't say whether
Dickerson would quarterback Pitt

‘ on Saturday at Rutgers but did

say, ”He’ll play a lot of ball from
here on in.”

Penn State recovers to beat West Virginia 

I By Ralph Bernstein J

AP_ Sports Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. —— Coach
Joe Paterno and his Penn State
football players feel they've
turned a corner with their come-
back victory over West Virginia.

The 18th-ranked Nittany Lions
fell behind 21-10 Saturday with
9:54 left and rallied with two late

touchdowns to beat the Moun-

taineers 25-21.

“When you're down by 11
with nine minutes to go, you bet-
ter decide if you're going to be a
football team right then and
there,” defensive tackle Matt

‘ Johnson said. I

’’I told myself, ’We are not go-
ing to lose this game.’ It was the
breaking point of our season. Ob-
viously, we had other players
who thought the same thing.”

Paterno echoed Johnson's
words. ’’I don't know if a loss
would have been demoralizing,
but we would have found out
who our friends are.

— ”This was an important game

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 2, I287

for all of us. We needed to find

out if wegcould play under’

pressure.”

The victory boosted the Nitta—
ny Lions’ record to 6-2 with three
games remaining, assuring them
a non-losing season for an NCAA-
record 49th consecutive year.

While Blair Thomas was the
star with a career-high 181 yards
on 36 carries and six pass recep-
tions for 41 yards, quarterback
Matt Knizner personified the
spirit of the comeback.

Even Paterno, who rarely criti-
cizes a player publicly, conced-
ed Knizner ”wasn’t playing well”
until the rally. To that point, the
fifth—year senior in his first season
as a starter completed 10 of 23
passes for 83 yards with two in-

terceptions. He missed open -

receivers, overthrowing and un-
derthrowing them.

Knizner, however, suddenly
got it going, completing three
passes during the game-winning
scoring drives, directing two long
drives. . ~

Marino, lose 35-24

By Fred Goodall

AP Sports Writer

MIAMI — Dan Marino
weathered a shaky start in the
rain and passed for four touch-
downs and 332 yards Sunday to
lead the Miami Dolphins to a

135-24 come-from-behind victory

over the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The NFL’s all-time, top-rated

quarterback completed 25 of 31-
attempts, including scoring pass-
es of 41 and 33 yards to MaTk'
Clayton and 50 yards to Mark
Duper that helped the Dolphins
overcome a 21-7 halftime deficit.
Marino, throwing for 300-plus
yards for the 24th time in his four-
year career, also tossed a 2-yard
TD pass to Bruce Hardy in the

said Knizner, who was booed
lustily by the sellout crowd of
85,108 when he came on the
field after West Virginia went
ahead 21-10.

”l wasn't doubting myself one
bit,” Knizner said. ”We never lost
confidence. I had great guys
around me who helped us win a
close, tough’ game. We ‘came
together, never quit and just kept
pushing.”

Paterno said he never consi-
dered removing Knizner.

”As long as we had a chance
to win, I never thought of taking
him ‘out. That wouldn't have
been fair,” he said.

_ ”This was the first time he's
been in a tough football game
where he had to do it.‘ He need-
ed that. It's not like he's played
a lot of football. This was only his
eighth game.”

Thomas handled the ball on 42

of Penn State's 88 offensive plays. ,

”l thought he played a super
game. You can't do more than he
did. He ran, caught the ball well,
pass-b|ocked,” the coach said,

adding he was pleased with a lot
of his players. ,
”lt was the kind of game that

you'd like to see a'Penn State

team play. We were good in that
fourth quarter. We made ‘big
plays when we had to make
them. It must have been a good
football game to watch.”

West Virginia Coach Don Neh-
len said Penn State ”came up a
few inches further than we did.”

”When the score was 21-10,
their defense got after our offense,
and our defense got tired," he
said.

”Blair Thomas is a great play-
er, there's no question about that.
We must have missed 5,000 tack-
les on him.”

Penn State is 44-8-2 in the rival-
ry and has won 28 of the last-29

meetings. The Mountaineers,‘

who fell to 4-4 after three straight

wins, haven't won at State Col-

lege in 18 games since 1954.
West Virginia appeared ready

to break through the Penn State‘
domination by overcoming a

10-7 halftime deficit.

II ’I

Major Harris threw 6 yards to

Keith Winn in the third period for A

a 14-10 lead. The Mountaineers
increased it to 21-10 on a 30-yard
pass from Harris to John Talley
with 9:54 left.

Freshman Leroy Thompson
brought the Lions back to life by
returning the kickoff 35 yards to
the Penn State 42. Knizner led a

six-play, 58-yard drive capped’ by ' I

Thomas’ 1-yard TD run. Knizner
threw a two-point conversion
pass to Thomas, and it was 21-18

with 7:54 to play.

West Virginia was unable to
move and punted to the Penn
State 38. Freshman Gary Brown
capped a seven-play, 62-yard
drive with a 19-yard scoring run
to put the Lions ahead 25-21.

second quarter. It was the 14th
four-touchdown game of his
career, three shy of the NFL
record held by Johnny Unitas,

- giving Marino 14 TD passes in
four games in 1987.

Troy Stratford, the Dolphin’s
rookie running back who gained
110 yards on 19 carries, capped
Miami's 28-point second half
with a 10-yard touchdown run
with 9:02 remaining in the fourth
period.

The victory stopped a two-
game losing streak for the 3-4

I  . Dolphins, who started the day in

Iastplace in the AFC Eastern Di-
-vision. Pittsburgh, tied for first in
the AFC Central after winning its
previous two games, fell to 4-3
before a crowd of 52,578 in Joe
Robbie Stadium.
There were 19,450 no-shows
-for the game, which was*teIe-
vised locally and started in a
steady drizzle that contributed to
Miami's sloppy play in the open-
ing minutes. ,
Pittsburgh took advantage of
' two turnovers within a 98-second
' span of the first quarter to take a
14-0 lead on Mark MaIone’s
10-yard touchdown pass to
’ Charles Lockett and an intercep-
'tion that Donnie Shell returned
50 yards for another TD.

Marina cut into at the outset of

.CIayton’s 41-yard TD reception
trimmed Miami's deficit to 21-14
and appeared to give the Dol-
phins an emotional boost.

‘ After Pittsburgh's Gary Ander-

' son _kicked a 46-yard field goal for

a 24-14 Steelers lead, Miami

passes for 205 yards for Pitts-
burgh. He was intercepted once.

Marina, the AFC’s top-rated
passer with a rating of 106.9 be-
fore Sunday, was intercepted
twice. The fifth-year pro reached
the minimum 1,500 career at-
tempts to qualify for the all-time
NFL rankings.

Shell's interception, the 51st of ‘

his 14-year career, bounced off
Clayton's hands and into the
grasp of the Pittsburgh safety,
who rambled up the left sideline
to give the Steelers a 14-0 lead
with 9:09 left in the opening
quarter. ,

Miami spent the next 9:34
marching 85 yards in 15 plays to
cut its deficit to 14-7 on Hardy's
touchdown reception.

Marino completed eight of
eight passes for 65 yards in the
drive, including a 20-yard com-
pletion to Hardy and a 13—yarder
to Mark Duper. The Miami quar-
terback also completed his ‘next
three passes to give’ him a string
of 11 consecutive completions,
before a Dolphins drive stalled at
the Pittsburgh 31.

The Steelers took over on
downs with 3:11 left in the half
and Malone moved his team 69
yards in 10 plays for a 21-7 half-
time lead. '

Completions of 21 yards to
Lockett, 18 yards to Calvin
Sweeney and 13 yards to Walter
Abercrombie fueled the march,
and Malone scrambled 10 yards
on third-and-10 to set up Pollard’s
1-yard TD run with 27 seconds
remaining.

_ The Steelers converted seven of
nine third-down plays in the first
half, but weren't nearly as effec-
tive afterrhalftime — finishing
nine-of-16 as the Miami defense
allowed only three points in the
final 30 minutes.

Duper’s touchdown reception
cut Pittsburgh's lead to 24-21
with 1:56 remaining in the third
quarter. Clayton beat Steelers cor-
nerback Dwayne Woodruff on
his 33-yard TD catch that put Mi-
ami ahead, two plays after Larry
Kolic deflected a Harry
Newsome punt recovered at the
Pittsburgh 46.

Miami, whose running game
has been a weakness in recent
years, outrushed the -Steelers
146-116. The Dolphins held Ear-
nest Jackson, the NFL’s leading
rusher to 32 yards on_ 12 carries,
while Abercrombie gained 52
yards on 12 attempts.
