UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Jack to Wisconsin?  

By Dan Bates

News Editor

University of Wisconsin sources
report that Pitt Executive Vice Pres-
ident Dr. Jack Freeman is under
serious consideration for the posi-
tion of president at the University of
Wisconsin System.

Freeman is believed to be one of
three finalists selected from approxi-
mately 150 nominees for the posi-
tion. The others are thought to be
University of Southern Illinois
Chancellor Kenneth Shaw and Ariz-
ona State University President Jack
Nelson. ' /

Freeman’s office did confirm that
he is a candidate, but his secretary
said Freeman would not disclose
any additional details.

The selection process began last
May when the University of Wiscon-
sin’s previous president, Dr. Robert
O'Neil, resigned and subsequently
accepted the position of president at
the University of Virginia.

According to Catherine Conroy, a .
former member of the “Wisconsin

governing Board of Regents, O’Neil
left in pursuit of “a position where he
could become more ofa scholar than
an administrator.”

The University of Wisconsin's
search committee accepted nomina-
tions until last June, when an esti-
mated I50 applications had been
received. By last week, the list had
been reduced to, six finalists, the
search‘committee's head, Dr. Joseph
Kauffman, disclosed yesterday.

The names of these applicants
were then turned over to the board
of regents, which hopes to make a
final decision by December of this
year, Kauffman said. He would not,
however, reveal whether Freeman
was indeed a finalist or if the selec-
tion was limited now to three
candidates.

Kauffman said the university will
be offering up to $100,000 per year
to the new president, although the
yearly salary could be as low as
$71,000.

The president’s duties would
include overseeing the university’s
26-campus statewide system.‘ The

Food fights seen as

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Over the past several years,
Lothrop Hall Cafeteria has been the
site of nearly half a dozen food
fights. And for some people, this
creates a hazard, but to others, the
food fights represent, in a sense,
merely a tradition.

_ “At the end — and only at the end
— of a term, there will be a food
fight," said the general manager of
food services, Ted Kokladas. “There
will be a rumor of a food fight a
couple days in advance and then,
quite suddenly, from what I under-
stand, near the end of the day, some-

one will get up and throw a piece of

cake or pie at someone else on the
other side of the room.

“We don’t believe [the ﬁghts] stem
from improper food or service, and
since students overlap from year to

- year, it has become a type of
tradition.”

However, not everyone sees the
throwing of food as a tradition.
According to a source in Lothrop
Cafeteria who wished to remain
anonymous, food fights can do more
than just mess up hair or dirty
clothes. They can be dangerous.

“Sure, it's a way to release tension
at the end of a term,” said the source.
“But when they start throwing

knives and forks and dishes, the
situation becomes hazardous."

According to Kokladas, though,

A memorial service will be
held Monday, Sept. 23, for
Robert Miller, a former Pitt pro-
fessor of psychiatry and psychol-
ogy who died Sept. l.

Miller, 59, died of leukemia at
Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal. A faculty member for 32
years, Miller taught psychobiol-
ogy at the medical school and
participated in individual advis-
ing in psychiatry. He was consi-
dered an expert in the field of

Miller is survived by his wife,
Eleanor; his son, Thomas; and
his daughter, Barbara. He also
had one grandchild.

will be held at 1:30 p.m. at the
Heinz Chapel.

size of the student body is estimated
at 163,000.

The president must also interact
with the public. “As the head, he
would be-the spokesperson for the
entire system of higher education in
the state,” Kauffman said.

The 54-year-old Freeman pres-
ently serves as the chief administra-
tive, financial and planning officer
at Pitt. He is primarily responsible
for the management of the universi-
ty’s operations in the areas of finan-
cial management, long-range
planning, budgeting, human resour-
ces, security, computing services,
physical plant, intercollegiate athlet-
ics and student services.

Freeman, after serving as a career
officer in the United States Air
Force, came to Pitt in 1967 to
assume the position of executive
"assistant to the chancellor. In 197],
he was appointed to the position of
president at Pitt’s Johnstown cam-
pus. He later served as vice chancel-
lor of planning and budget until his
current appointment as executive

broken dishes or ﬂying utensils. “Of
course, we don't condone food

fights," Kokladas said, “but the
items thrown have been limited to
food. Once knives and forks are
being thrown around, you’re talking
about projectiles, and if that ever
happened, we would stop it
instantly. As long as there have been
food fights, no one has ever gotte

hurt.” -

The source admitted that there
have been no injuries related to food
fights, but he pointed out that the
damage alone was worthy of stop-
ping the yearly hurling of food.

.“They have to close the cafeteria
early because of the mess,” he said.
“One time, there was nearly six

inches of food on the ﬂoor. It took
us an entire day to clean it up."
The source also said that the cam-

pus police had to be called in at times
to restore order.—“They come in like
stormtroopers,” the source said.
“They spread out and pace the ﬂoor
and yell at the students.”

Kokladas said they had utilized
policemen in the past but never more
than one at a time. “We normally

know — one time I got a pie in the
face when I went down there.”

I(_okladas, however, said his
options were limited. “We could
send in a battery of policemen, but
then we have to be concerned with
the students who have nothing to do
with it and their feelings.

PAT proposes plans for ,    
subway extension to Pitt and beyond   

By Ingrid Smith
Staff Writer

With the downtown subway
barely two months old, the Port
Authority released a study showing
that it would be economical to
extend the subway north to the
Cathedral of Learning, past
Carnegie-Mellon University to
Shady Avenue in Squirrel Hill.

The new $400 million expansion,
referred to as the Spine Line, could
generate between 28,000 and 47,000
riders per day or up to five million
passengers per year. The 5.7-mile
subway would also result in an
annual savings of $2 million in oper-
ating costs for _PAT.

“Congestion and topographical
constraints severely restrict the Oak-
land areas potential for future
expansion. And yet, as Pittsburgh
undergoes a transition from heavy
industry to a services industry orien-
tation, the Oakland community as a
research, educational and medical
center can only grow in impor-
tance," said John P. Robin, chair-
man of PA'T’s planning committee.

“Two months ago, there were
skeptics saying that a subway would
never work in Pittsburgh and that
the Spine Line was a pipe dream,”
Robin continued. “Now we’re.plan-
ning to use the subway as the hub for
the Spine Line through our heaviest
transit ridership corridor.”

PAT board chairman James C.
Roddey believes that the construc-
tion of the Spine Line could create
up to 28,000 jobs that would further

“Believe me, we've tried talking to
the students before the fact, but that
only seems to add fuel to the fight. I
send one guard in without any type

of weapon," he said, “and only as a
deterrent."

The source also mentioned that'-
this is the only cafeteria in the area
that has food fights. He cited the
cafeterias of such schools as
Duquesne University, Carlow Col-
lege and Carnegie-Mellon as
examples.

“The. management should do

something other than bringing in the ‘
campus police,” said the source. '

“They should talk to thestudents
and tell them it is a childish, imma-

ture act, and maybe then they will q I

stop this silly act.”

alleviate Allegheny County’s unem-
ployment rate.

Under the alignments studied, the
Oakland terminals of the Spine Line
would be located at Carnegie-
Mellon Uninversity. If extended to
Squirrel Hill and the North Side, the
line would terminate in the vicinity
of Shady Avenue and in the Three
Rivers Stadium area, respectively.
Other possible station locations
include Allegheny Center, the North
Shore, Civic Arena, Duquesne Uni--
versity and Kirkpatrick Street.

Following final review of the
study by various planning and
governmental agencies, PAT will
seek federal support of an alterna-
tive analysis study to obtain more
detailed information on the Spine
Line’s potential ridership, costs and
its environmental and construction
impacts. _ '

Britain expels six more Soviet spies

MOSCOW — The cycle of tit-for-
tat Anglo-Soviet spy expulsions
may not be over. .

A Soviet reporter known for his

I KGB connections warns that Mos-

cow is likely to retaliate because Bri-
tain yesterday ordered. six more

‘ Soviets out of the country.

That move brought the number of
Soviets sent out of Great Britian to
31. Authorities in London last week
accused 25 Soviets of spying based
on information from a KGB spy
chief who defected to the West. The

Soviets responded .over the weekend

by kicking out 25 Britons.
The so-called “spy war" is becom-

‘' ing a test of wills between Prime

Minister Thatcher and the Kremlin’s
Mikhail Gorbachev. Thatcher told
reporters today that her expulsion
order has “broken the heart” of the
Soviets’ spy operation in Britain,
and she hopes the matter has ended.

But a spy scandal in West Ger-
many appears to be growing. A
secretary in the West German chan-
cellor’s office and her East German-
educated husband are suspected of
being spies. Officials believe they
have defected to the East.

Students riot

SOUTH AFRICA — Racial vio-
lence and its attempted suppression
continue in South Africa. Police

fired shotguns, rubber bullets and
tear gas yesterday at groups of pro-
testing students. One group was
boycotting classes near Johannes-
burg and the other was demanding
the re-opening of hundreds of
schools around Cape Town.
Youths burned barricades of tires
in a township near Cape Town.
Police fired rubber bullets and tear
gas and arrested about 176 people,
including parents, teachers and the

school principal. A witness said she .

saw a youth shot in the back by
police.‘ Black pupils across the coun-
try have mounted sporadic school
boycotts, demanding an end to dis-
crimination in education.

Reagan meets

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Presi-

night at 8 p.m. High on the agenda
were the approaching superpower

The president opened his conference

warning Congress of the dangers of
protectionist trade legislation.

Tanner testifies

PITTSBURGH —— Pirates man-
ager Chuck Tanner testified at one
of the Pittsburgh drug trials
yesterday.

Called to the witness stand in the
trial of Curtis Strong, Tanner testi-
fied that he once warned shortstop
Dale Berra about a certain “unsa-
vory character” hanging around
ballplayers, although Tanner said he
never met Strong. Tanner’s testim-
ony conflicted with that of Berra,
one of several ballplayers who have
testified in Strong’s trial. Berra said
Strong was once in a hallway near
the Pirate clubhouse and Tanner
told the shortstop, “Don’t talk to the
gentleman.” But Tanner said he
didn’t recall such an incident, claim-
ing that it was in Philadelphia that
he once gave his “unsavory charac-
ter” warning to Berra.

Tanner was subpoenaed by the
defense team to testify at Strong’s

The trial, in its llth day, was
recessed until this morning. In
another courtroom on the floor of
the Federal Building, jury selection
continued in the trial of Robert
McCue. Like Strong, McCue is
charged with selling cocaine to
ballplayers.

ROME (UPI) —— Roman authori-
ties say the motive is unclear in the

ISRAEL (UPI) — Israel confirms

an “electronic malfunction” and cut

MOSCOW (UPI) — Last week's
test of an American anti-satellite
weapon cast a shadow yesterday
over the new round of super-power
arms talks in Geneva.

Soviet negotiator" Viktor Karpov
arrived in the Swiss resort for the
third round of talks, calling for what
he labeled “meaningful and mutu-
ally acceptable solutions” aimed at
ending the arms race in space and on
earth.

But Moscow warned last week
that the'A-Sat test had a “negative"
effect on the arms talks, and yester-
day, Karpov blamed the U.S. insist-
ence on developing space weapons
for undermining the chances of pro-

gress at the talks, which began last
March. ‘ _

As in two previous sessions, the
negotiators will deal with three top-

” Around the World

ics: space, strategic arms and
medium-range missiles.

arsenals unless the “Star Wars" idea

  ‘Student’ Athletes

It’s no secret that American society tends to glorify its
athletes in gross disproportion to their actual worth. Can
anyone sincerely dispute that American athletes are
rewarded in excess of the value of their contributions to
society?

Not only do they often receive free educations or, in the
case of professional athletes, astronomically high mone-
tary remuneration for their services, but they are also
reported to frequently enjoy privileges which are denied
the rest of us. For instance, it has been rumored that
many members of the collegiate football teams neglect
their classroom responsibilities and yet are not punished
by the team.

Undeniably, these football teams are great revenue
generators for the universities. We’re not disputing that.
And we appreciate all the benefits that accrue to the
university as a result of these football teams’ appeal.

No, what we are suggesting is that it is time to put an
end to the farce of the so-called “amateur standing” of
college football. Everyone has heard the rumors: Foot-
ball players have been rewarded with cars (or the privi-
lege to use university—owned vehicles) and /or they are
paid for jobs which exist only on paper. While these
rumors have not been substantiated, there is cause to give
them careful scrutiny.

Perhaps NCAA regulations should be altered to allow
college athletes to be salaried. And, is there any reason to
enforce academic standards for college athletes? Should
these types of changes be instituted?

Let’s not pretend that these athletes are yet a part of the
student body at-large. In this eventuality, let their exist-
ence be carried on apart from the student body, and let
their affairs not intertwine.

Teaching

Matthew Tolbert’s complaint,
(“Simply Speaking,” Sept. 13) about
having a professor who cannot
teach, deserves a conscientious
response.-

He describes a teacher who can-
not explain simple concepts, who
mumbles in accented English, and
who scribbles in disorder on the
chalkboard. He also describes stu-
dents who sit in back of the class-
room sleeping, talking, or making
insulting comments about the pro-
fessor. I frankly don’t know whose
behavior is more regrettable, but I
will begin with the teacher.

This is a complex university in .
which more than 2,000 faculty
members have been hired for a var-
iety of primary competencies, from
transplanting livers to understand-
ing Central American politics. We
are, after all, a research university
and not a.liberal arts college in
which the faculty teach but don’t
actually “do” their subjects. If we
didn't have a faculty of research spe-
cialists, our students’ educations
would be, on the whole, not nearly
as rich. I say this, not to excuse the
University or any faculty member
for poor teaching, but to show what
a large and astoundingly hetero-

geneous group we have doing our

teaching. '

Unfortunately, statistics demand
that in any large group, some indi-
viduals will be better or worse than
others at any given task; a few will be
a lot better or a lot worse. And that
includes all people who. teach,
whether they are Pitt professors, lib-
eral arts college professors, or high
school _teachers. The latter, for
example, are all carefully and uni-
formly trained to teach, but are they
all good at it?

Thus, there are bound to be both
stars and lemons, and all kinds in
between. The problem is not how to
eliminate all the lemons —— an
impossible task if we are to remain a’
large and comprehensive university
— but what to do about the ones
that we discover?

Mr. Tolbert’s professor’s teach-
ing, if accurately described, is indeed
disgraceful. It is virtually a crime to
charge tuition for education and to
provide only unintelligible mum-
bling. That is why, about ten years
ago, Pitt's administration did pre-
cisely what Mr. Tolbert suggests: it
set up a committee to look into the
quality of teaching in the University
and tosee what could be done about
(a) measuring it and (b) improving
it. The result was that two new units,

' now about eight years old, were set

up: the Office for the Evaluation of
Teaching (OET), which obtains stu-
dents’ evaluations of their profes-
sors’ teaching, and the Office of
Faculty Development (OFD), which
does a variety of things to improve
that teaching.

Interestingly, the Office of
Faculty Development, of which lam
the Director, carries out among
other things all four of the activities
that Mr. Tolbert suggests: videotap-
ing and critiqueing classroom teach-
ing, acknowledging and rewarding
good teaching (via the Chancellor’s-
Distinguished Teaching Awards),
referring foreign instructors to an
English improvement-program, and
offering seminars on effective teach-
ing methods. It is understandable
that, as a student, Mr. Tolbert
would not have known that we do
these things, but the faculty and
administration are well aware of
them».

How, then, do lemons such as Mr.
Tolbert’s professor sneak through?
The answer is that an administrative
unit with limited resources cannot
possibly put 2,000 faculty members
through the mill even if they all
volunteered for it. Also, participa-
tion in the evaluation and improve-
ment programs is indeed voluntary;
a professor must first recognize that
his or her teaching can be improved
(and whose can't), and then volun-
tarily respond to OET’s and OFD’s
widely-advertised evaluation, diag-
nosis and improvement services. (It
is intended that regular teaching
evaluations soon become manda-
tory for all faculty, but they are not
at present.)

What, then, can students do who
find themselves on the receiving end

of abysmal teaching? Switching to
other classes is not always possible,
and sleeping or rowdiness in class
will just exacerbate the problem. So
will tolerating it “philosophically”.
What the students in Mr. Tolbert’s
class should do is report the profes-
sor’s performance in writing to the
department chairperson, with a
copy to the dean. (If you don’t know
who the chairperson and dean are,
look up the department and school
in the front of the Faculty and Staff
Directory.) Only then can the most
directly-involved administrators
address the problem — by talking
with the professor and perhaps
insisting‘ that he be evaluated‘ by
both students and peers; by helping
him to interpret those evaluations;
by encouraging him to “volunteer”
for videotaping and other OF D ser-
vices; by applying pressure, if neces-
sary, in the form of less desirable
workloads, loss of perquisites, or_
even less-than-standard salary incre-
ments; and if all else fails, by reas-
signing his teaching responsibilities
to at least keep him away from
undergraduates.

In short, I believe that the Univer-
sity is doing what it can, within the
limits of available resources and
faculty individualism, about the
inevitable minority of inept
teachers. And I congratulate Mr.
Tolbert for coming up with several
of the same improvement measures
that we are using. But I want to
emphasize that the student must do

his part by speaking up effectively:

’ by having the courage to complain

about specific cases to the appropri-
ate administrators. Otherwise, the

improvement measures cannot be‘

applied where they are most needed.
If students are willing to take it lying
down, cynically concluding that the
university doesn’t care about good
teaching, they are showing only that
they really don’t care about obtain-
ing a quality education.

Fashionable Irrevererzce

/G eorge Kresak

Until very recently, I fervently
believed that man, in spite of his
absurd fascination with Trivial Pur-
suit”, was master of his own destiny.
Then I learned that some mysterious
force within our own government
had not only prevented America
from winning the Vietnam War but
had stymied any displays ofindivid-
ual heroism as well.

Clearly, in this instance, man had
not exercised autonomy. Upon sub-
sequent re-evaluation, I.’ve come to
the conclusion that man can be truly
free only so long as it does not inter-
fere with album sales or box office
receipts.

Even so, man has been induced to
dare much in the name of freedom.
In the past, courageous Americans
have been willing to bravely sacrifice
their livestock, their children, even
their food processors in exchange
for vague promises of liberty and the

notion of endless salad bars.

But in spite of all the rhetoric, it
hasn’t been freedom for which
Americans have been so willing to
die. The terms liberty and demo-
cracy have ceased to have meaning
and have become mere window
dressing for American politicians —
so much ideologial wrapping with
which to cloak policy in order to
inspire the faith and support of the
American people.

And what is the attitude of Ameri-
can citizens to this fate? Well, if I’m
interpreting the signals correctly, the
message they’re sending to the
American government is this: “You
can rob us of our freedom, our dig-
nity, even our pest—control strips;
but don’t mess with our modern
plumbing!” This much has become
evident: Americans will risk their
immortal souls for private
bathrooms.

Only the American youth, pos-

sessed of an idealism borne of a flat-
tering innocence, continues to

believe that freedom is inherently
desirable. For the rest of us, freedom
is valued only to the extent that it
does not impose on our right to
blow-dry our hair in comfort.
Indeed, the collective American

terror of_the Soviet Union is inspired

not so much by the fear of commu-
nist enslavement, nuclear annihila-

tion or cabbage soup, so much as it is _

by the deep-seated fear that the

Soviet government is conspiring to -

invade and occupy our bathrooms.

But increasingly,’ Americans are
discovering that the dreams, hopes,
wants and desires of the Soviet citi-
zenry, discounting its irrational
fondness for winter sports, are
remarkably similar to our own.
They, too, display a sincere longing
to dispose of bodily wastes mod-

estly, without the inconvenience of
an audience. And, with frank
urgency, they frequently allude to
the day when they can sing solo in
the shower.

In light of the information here
related, I would like to suggest some
options for American foreign policy
which may, if enacted, serve to
simultaneously reduce superpower
tensions and force Jerry Falwell to
confess his attraction to nihilism.
First, the American government
should eliminate trade restrictions
on all non-military, plumbing-
related technology.

Second, American firms should
be permitted to embark on joint ven-
tures with Soviet enterprises in the
construction of bathrooms.
Together, these actions should cor-
rect the cruel shortage of private
bathrooms in the Soviet Union and
thereby eliminate the envy with

American Trade Off; Freedom for Comfort  

which Soviet citizens regard Ameri-
cans and, in America, frustrate the

Reagan administration's attempts to .

re-ignite the Cold War mentality.
Third, a program of cultural
exchange should be pursued. This
would serve not only to dispel many
mutually-propagated untruths

about the two societies but would

also provide the Soviets with a valu-
able source of reading materials to
equip their newly-acquired
bathrooms.

Objections to these options are
sure to be many and violent. Some
will argue that the Soviets are a vile
and nasty lot and, as such, are unde-
serving of private baths. Others will
be more rational and intelligent. I
will probably choose to disregard
them all, as I am disinclined to
believe that anything approaching a
truly receptive nature actually
exists.

Now this won't hurt at bit/Michael Fay

Just over a week ago councilman
Stephan Grabowski proposed a cut-
few for the City of Pittsburgh. The
ordinance, if passed, would make it
illegal for children under the age of
18 to be on city streets, playgrounds

or lots from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

This proposition, according to
Grabowski, will keep kids off the
streets — and thus out of trouble -
or will hit them with a $15 fine and
some time in the nearest precinct

house.

Normally, I would be able to for-
give a man like Grabowski for his
simplistic and reactionary doctrine,
but he happens to be in a position to
enact it. It seems that when there is a
panic over the problem of juvenile
delinquency (which is not that big a
problem in this city), the constitu-
tional rights of the young get
trampled on. '

Does government have the
authority to limit (in times of peace)

our freedom of movement or to pea-
ceably assemble? The Bill of Rights
doesn’t read that way to me, but then
again, I don't occupy so high a loft as
the councilman. The fact that we are
all United States citizens at birth
also must be a smaller matter than I
expected. After all, I assumed it
would be. illegal to search high-
school lockers arbitrarily.

It appears that the councilman is
following a Soviet model. There is

very little violent crime in the streets
of Moscow, and I’m sure that Soviet
kids are inside nights doing their
schoolwork. For these reasons, 1 can
understand how, for some, the total-
itarian model set by the Soviets
might be attractive. It is , after all, a
viable short cut. It’s always easier to
stomp on a problem than to con-
structively deal with it.

Yes, Mr. Grabowski, freedom is a
scary thing. It is also a thing for

Cirabowski’s Curfew; Solution or Oppression

which Americans — for over 200
years — have been willing to ﬁght. It

. is sad that when in times of paranoia

and quiet desperation, people in

positions of power select drastic.

measures, measures that undermine
our basic freedoms.

Sure, they’re just kids, and a cur-
few probably wouldn’t cause much
of a stir, but there is a principle at
stake here, and I think it’s one
worthy of defense. I

Students share culture at intercultural house

Mitzi Susanto, a freshman at Pitt,
lives with a very diverse family. Each
member comes from a different part
of the world. ,

Susanto lives in the Intercultural
House at 272 N. Dithridge St., in
Oakland.

“We’re really just one big family,”
she said. “Everyone treats each other
like a family member.”

The IC House offers a chance for
Pitt students to live with other stu-
dents from widely different racial,
cultural and academic backgrounds.
Of the 19 students living there, only
nine were born in the United States.
The other students are from coun-
tries in Asia, Africa, Europe and
South America. There are students
from different cultures who espouse
opposing ideologies.

“The IC House goes beyond
nationalistic issues,” said Howard
Green, the resident director. “We try
to see how races interact — take a
look at racial differences.”

Established in 1970, the IC House
was originally designed to be a place
for black and white students to live
together and attempt to overcome
their prejudices. The interracial idea
has expanded to include people
from many different cultures. Stu-
dents of different races and cultures
are paired to live together.

“We try to keep a racial, sexual
and international balance,” said
Green, an original member of the
house. “lt's difficult for the Ameri-
can students to realize that there are
different lifestyles." A . .  . ,  is  . ._ .   . .. . .

Sometimes, these_students _don’t
communicate with Americans

because they don't want to talk
about personal issues.

In some other cultures, there is a
clear distinction between men and
women. Middle Eastern men, for
example, might be insulted if asked
to work in the kitchen. “Someone
who comes to the United States has
to get used to that idea,” Green said.
“When students move in here, they
have to understand that everyone
will be treated equally.”

Another minor problem is lan-
guage. “Everyone here speaks Eng-
lish, but one has to learn how to
listen carefully. It really hasn’t been
that much of a problem,” Green
said. .

The students must also learn to
live with people from politically
opposing countries. “We have one
student from Taiwan andanother
from Shanghai, but nationalism
hasn’t been a problem,” said Green.
“I think students find that they can
learn from an enemy as well as a
friend. When I say ‘enemy,’.I mean
in the ideological and political sense.
We’re all quite close.”

Green" attempts to make the stu-
dents question their own prejudices.
“Friction can occur because of the
fact that we want people to closely
examine their racial differences.
This kind of relationship doesn’t
happen in the dorms,” he said.

Green believes that while progress
has been made, race relations in this
country need to be improved.
“Racism in America still occurs —
we just have learned how to hide it.
It’s not so obvious,” Green said.

Originally, the IC House was

“I think students find that they can learn from
an enemy as well as a friend. When I say
enemy I mean the ideological sense. We’re all

quite close.”

funded partially by Pitt. When the
university reduced programs in the
mid ’70s, the IC House was one of
the first to go. ‘‘I would like this
concept to get bigger, but the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has been very
uncooperative,” Green said. “They
give us no supportive funds.

“The university has adopted a phi-
losophy of cost effectiveness — sup-
porting programs like computer
science, the MBA program and the
Pitt football team. “These programs
generate dollars,” Green added.
“Unless you generate a profit, you
are in danger of being eliminated.”

But not being funded by Pitt also
lets the house enjoy certain advan-
tages. “lt tgivesus more freedom.
And we do a lot of things where we
don’t have to worry about it being

socially acceptable with the univer- '

sity,” Green said.

The house is owned by the Ger-
trude Stein Foundation, a small, pri-
vate, Pittsburgh-based group. The
group receives no profit from the
house, according to Green. The $647
rent per term includes one meal a
week, which is held on Sunday. This
meal is prepared by different house
members each week.

“We have a lot of fun during our
Sunday dinners,” Green said. “And
frequently, the meals -are exotic
dishes prepared by some of our for-
eign students. We’re not all master
chefs, but we have a lot of fun.”

Each student has a specific box in
which to store food. The food in
these boxes range from Wheaties to
egg noodles, but rice seems to be the
favorite.

The cleaning and maintenance of
the house is shared by everyone.
Each resident has a particular duty,
and each must clean the bathrooms
at least once a month. “It’s beyond
just a place to stay,” Green said. “It’s
required that people cooperate and
interact.”

Green believes that students have

the capacity to learn more than their-

majors require, since the IC House
tries to help residents understand
how to perceive different cultures
and rid themselves of stereotyped
perceptions.

“The best way to describe living a-
the IC House is like having 20 broth-
ers and sisters,” Green said. “People
consider it to be home; people care
about the house. Conﬂict occurs,
but it’s just like living in a family.”

ehigh professor
iscusses teaching

Why do you teach? My friend
asked the question when I told him
that I didn’t want to be considered
for an administrative position. He
was puzzled that I did not want what
was obviously a “step up” toward
what all American boys are taught
to want when they grow up: money
and power. — ‘ '

Certainly I don’t teach because
teaching is easy for me. Teaching is
the most difficult of the various ways
I have attempted to earn my living:
bulldozer mechanic, carpenter, uni-
versity administrator, writer. For
me, teaching is a red-eye, sweaty-
palm, sinking-stomach profession.
Red-eye, because I never feel ready
to teach, no matter how late I stay up
preparing the night before. Sweaty-
palm, because I’m always nervous
before I walk into that classroom,
sure that I will be found out for the
fool that I am. Sinking-stomach,
because I walk out of the classroom
an hour later convinced that I was
even more boringthan usual.

Nor do I teach because I think I
know answers, or because I know a
body of information I feel driven to
share. Sometimes I am amazed that
my students actually take notes on
what I say in class!

Why, then, ‘do I teach?

I teach because I like the pace of
the academic calendar. June, July
and August offer opportunity to mix
reflection, research and writing —
all ingredients in my recipe for
teaching.

I teach because teaching is a pro-
fession built on change. Even when
the material is the same, I change —
and, more important, my students
change.

I teach because I like the freedom
to make my own mistakes, to learn

. ,. ’..—v V’
.,.,_.:.....,.,..7,f; -~_-_-rglf‘ run -33-: I,’

my own lessons, to stimulate myself
and my students. As a teacher, I am
my own boss. IfI want my freshmen
to learn to write by creating their
own writing textbook, who is to say
I may not? Such courses may be co-
lossal failures, but we can all learn
from failures.

I teach because I like to ask ques-
tions that students must struggle to
answer. The world is full of right
answers to bad questions. Teaching,
I sometimes brush up against good
questions.

I teach because I like to learn.
Indeed, I stay alive as a teacher only
as long as I am learning. One of the
major discoveries of my professional
life is that I teach best not what I
know, but what I want to learn.

I teach because I enjoy finding
ways within an ivory-tower profes-
sion to get myself and my students
out of the ivory tower and into the
real world. I once taught a course
call “Self-Reliance in a Technologi-

cal Society.” My 15 students read -

Emerson and Thoreau and Huxley.
They keptjournals. They wrote term
papers.

But we also set up a corporation,
borrowed money froma bank,~—pur-
chased a run-down house and prac-
ticed self-reliance by renovating it.
At the end of the semester, we sold
the house, repaid our loan, paid our
taxes and distributed the profits
among the group. H

I Certainly this was not your aver-
age English. course. But 15 future
lawyers, accountants and business
people suddenly found themselves
reading Thoreau’s Walden with
fresh eyes. They knew why he went
to the woods, how he built his cabin,
and why he felt so good about his

experiment that he wanted to tell the
world about it. They also knew why,
in the end, he left the woods. He had
tasted the waters of Walden Pond. It
was time to I move on to other
nectars. .

I teach because teaching gives me
many nectars to taste of, many
woods to enter and leave, many fine
books to read and many ivory tow-
ers and real-world experiences to
discover. Teaching gives me pace

and variety and challenge and the
opportunity to keep on learning.

I have left out, however, the most
important reasons why I teach.

One is Vicky. My first doctoral
student, Vicky was an energetic
young bubble who had trouble see-
ing past the thrill of literature to the
rigor of academic scholarship. But
she plugged away at her dissertation
on a little-known 14th-century poet.
And she hammered out articles and
sent them off to learned journals.

She did it all herself, with only an
occasional nudge from me. But I was
there when she finished her disserta-
tion, got word that those articles
were accepted, landed a job and won
a fellowship to Harvard working on
a book developing ideas she had_ger-
minated as my student.

Another reason is George, one of
the brightest students I have ever
had. He started as an engineering
student, then switched to English
because he decided he liked persons
better than things. He stayed for a
master’s degree and now teaches
English in a junior high school.

There is Jeanne. She ran away
from college, but some of her class-
mates brought her back because
they wanted her to see the end of the
self-reliance house project. I was
there when she came back. I was
there when she told me that she later
became interested in the urban poor
and went on to become a civil-rights
lawyer.

There is Jacqui, a cleaning woman
whoknows by intuition more than
most of us ever learn by analysis.
Jacqui has decided to ﬁnish high
school and go to college.

These are the real reasons I teach,
these people who grow and change
in front of my eyes. Being a teacher is
being present at the creation, when
the clay begins to breathe. Nothing
‘is more exciting than being nearby
when the breathing begins.

A “promotion” out of teaching
would give me money and power.

But I have money. I get paid for

doing what I enjoy most: reading. 
books, talking with people, making ‘
discoveries and asking questions"

like, “What is the point of being
rich?"

And I have power. I have the‘,

power to nudge, to fan sparks, to ask
troubling questions, to_ praise an.
attempted answer, to condemn hid-
ing from the truth, to suggest books,
to point out a pathway. What other
power matters?

But teaching also offers some-
thing besides money and power: it

offers love. Not only the love of"

learning and of books and ideas, but
also the love that a teacher feels for
the rare student who walks.into a

teachers life and begins to breathe. _

Perhaps love is the wrong word;
magic might be better.
I teach because, being around

people who are beginning to—

breathe, I occasionally find myself
catching my breath with them.

The ‘Pitt News - September 18, 1985

Travel Abroad      

Home-exchange a great service

A California college professor
and his wife have spent the past six
summers in Europe, courtesy of a
home-exchange service through
which they swap their house and car
for a house and car abroad. Last
year they vacationed in an Irish cas-
tle. Their only significant expense
was the charter ﬂight.

A Hollywood film maker, who
hates the impersonality of big-city
hotels, checked in to his favorite
“bed-and-breakfast” place in New
York while visiting the Big Apple for
the Emmy Awards. He had no over-
coat, and it was unseasonably cool.
Not to worry, said his hostess; she
would lend him her husband's. Suit-
ably attired, he went to the cerem-
ony and picked up an award. “What
hotel would have done that for me?”
he asked later.

A Chicago businessman, who had
been raised on a farm, wanted his
city-bred children to experience the
land and learn that eggs don’t come
from plastic cartons. So he sent his
family on an inexpensive farm vaca-
tion in Indiana. He knew his plan
had succeeded when his daughter,
back at home, looked out at the rain
and sighed, “Oh, no. The hay will be
ruined!”

Many Americans, eager to travel
but unable to afford sky-high lodg-
ing and restaurant prices, have come
up with these and other inventive
ways to see the world. In addition to
exchanging. houses and staying on
farms, they use youth hostels and
empty rooms on college campuses.
Above all, they’ve discovered the
bed-and-breakfast. concept, which
embraces every kind of accommoda-
tion from a Fifth Avenue apartment
to a Montana ranch.

Let's look at some of these new
travel opportunities in detail:

Bed and Breakfast

“It's the most significant travel
development in years,” says Patricia
Wilson, founder of the American
Bed and Breakfast Association.
“People not only can save money,
they find it more homelike than
commercial lodgings.”

They certainly do. I recently
sampled my first bed and breakfast
in Washingotn, D.C. Through a res-
ervation agency called the Bed and
Breakfast League, Ltd., I found
accommodation in an apartment
building that had a doorman and an
underground garage. When I
arrived, my hostess showed me to a
sunny room with its own bath and a
view of Rock Creek Park. “If you get
hungry, just raid the icebox,” she
said. In the morning, she served
juice, coffee, and croissants with
homemade jam — all with Limoges
china and embroidered linen. The
cost for everything .was $45, about
half the price of a nearby hotel.

With such bargains around, it’s
small wonder that bed and break-
fasts are ﬂourishing in over 1500
towns and cities across the United
States. It is, of course, not so much a
discovery as a rediscovery. The idea
is as old as the nation itself(“George
Washington Slept Here" was the
ultimate bed-and-breakfast acco-
lade). But when interstate highways
diverted travelers from the roads
where tourists homes were, motel
chains took over.

In 1975 Betty Rundback of
Greentown, Pa., realized that her
family of seven couldn’t afford the
trip they wanted to make across
America. Remembering the tourist
homes of her youth, Rundback went
to the library for a directory, but
found that the last such book had
been written in the l930s. She
decided to produce her own guide.
The result, a slender booklet with
only 45 places, was an instant
success.

Today, Bed and Breakfast U. S.A.
is a best-selling travel book that is
updated every year and contains
descriptions of over 600 places to
stay, as well as reservation services

that can book an additional 10,000 «

homes.

At about the same time Rundback
was putting together her book. Jean
Brown, a retired Californiateacher,

it returned from Europe after staying

in many bed and breakfasts. Hoping
the idea would work at home, she
started a bed-and-breakfast booking
service. .

Thus was born Bed and Breakfast
International, the first nationwide
reservation service. It has since
booked 20,000 travelers into homes
across the country. For $30 to $85 a
night, double, .people can stay in
lodgings that range from Victorian
mansions to houseboats.

At last count, there were more
than 200 agencies handling book-
ings on either a nationwide or
regional scale. Even New York City,
long thought unsuitable for the con-
cept, is now on the bed-and-
breakfast circuit. In 1980 two
schoolteachers, Frances Tesser and
Mary McAulay, started a reserva-
tion service called Urban Ventures.
They began with just four places.
Today they have 600, offering every-
thing from Bronx walkups to Park
Avenue penthouses. The prices go
from $26 to $80 double.

“One of the nicest things is that
hosts and guests often form‘ real
friendships,” says Tesser. “They’ve
been known to invite one another to
dinner and talk until all hours. One

’ visiting French couple were so taken

by their host's knowledge of wine
that they invited him to their vine-
yard in France. And he went!"

Bed and breakfasts do have some
drawbacks. There is no bar or room
service, and rooms often lack a pri-
vate telephone and TV. The bath
may be down the hall, and bedroom
doors don’t always lock. But these
shortcomings are usually more than
compensated for by the kind of
warmth few commercial establish-
ments offer."

Farm Vacations

Long before the present bed-and-
breakfast boom got under way, Pat
Dickerman was making the concept
work on farms. Back in the 1950s, a
business associate suggested to her
that urban Americans were missing
a lot by not experiencing rural liv-
ing. Subsequently Dickerman criss-
crossed the country, lining up rural
homes where people could have
wholesome, relatively inexpensive
vacations. Eventually she compiled
Farm, Ranch & Country Vacations,
which lists over 200 places where
people can “go rural” — feeding
stock, riding horses and strolling
country lanes. More and more fami-
lies are choosing such holidays,
which can cost as little as $25 a day.

College Dorms

Other Americans have discovered
the college circuit as a way to cut
costs. Some’300 colleges, from Sta n-
ford in the West to New York City's

Fashion Institute of Technology in
the East —— and even some abroad —
now offer lodgings. A few make
rooms available all year, but most
rent only in the summer when school
is out. Prices average under $25 and
sometimes include access to a low-
cost cafeteria and other campus
facilities.

Since colleges handle their own
bookings and have widely varying
policies that may change from
semester to semester, it is‘ best to

make reservations directly before

. leaving on a trip.

Hostels ,

An even less expensive way to see
the world is by hosteling, where
lodging averages $5.50 a night. Hos-
tels used to be geared to young
peole, but lately older travelers have
climbed on the bandwagon. Access
to such places is available byjoining
American Youth Hostels, where an
individual membership is $20 ($10
for seniors and juniors) and a family

' membership is $30.

You might stay in a lighthouse
(Pigeon Point, CaIif.), ina lifesaving
station (on Nantucket Island,

Mass.), or at assorted other spots-
_throughout the United States and in

50 other countries. “On a typical
hostel evening, you may encounter
people from a dozen countries,” says
Bob Johnson, executive director of
American Youth Hostels.

House Swapping

For those who don’t want to move
from place to place each night, an
exciting way to change scenery is by
swapping houses. Deirdre and
James Stanforth, for example, have
a brownstone in Manhattan that
they swapped — nervously — for a
castle in Europe a dozen years ago.
Once they’d done it, they became
converts, and today they have sev-
eral house swaps behind them. so
far, they've stayed in France, Ire-
land, Canada and Portugal.

The largest house-swapping direc-
tory, the Vacation Exchange club,
contains 6000 entries. The publisher
takes no responsibility for the swap

itself; readers correspond and sew’ -

up the details on their own.
Two years ago even Colorado’s
Gov. Richard D. Lamm caught

.house-swapping fever. During the

Christmas season, he exchanged the

official governor’s residence for a .

house in San Francisco. Later, the
state legislature took a dim view of
this, and reminded him that the
mansion was not his to swap. (One
state senator jokingly suggested that
he’d like to swap Colorado’s state
house for Florida’s for two weeks
during the winter.) _ i

There can be drawbacks to
exchanges, of course — misunder-
standings about arrival and depar-
ture times and poor housekeepers.
Yet such complaints are infrequent.
Deirdre Stanforth has never had a
bad experience in 12 years of house-
swapping. She attributes this to the
psychology of the situation. “No
money changes hands," she says.
“You feel more like a guest in some-
one else’s house."

Aside from saving money, friend-
liness is the principal attraction of
these alternate ways of travel, be it
bed and breakfast, farm, hostel, col-
lege dorm or swapped house. And
that attraction extends to everyone
involved.

  Athlete of the Week

The Pitt News -‘September 18, 1985

 

Dave Torrence

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

This week’s Pitt News Athlete of
the Week is Pitt soccer team goalie
Dave Torrence. Torrence, a senior
from Arlington, Va., has not been
scored upon yet this year. He passed
the school record for career shutouts
last weeklwhen the Panthers beat
Mercyhurst, and he ran his streak of
consecutive shutouts to three with
the 5-0 win over Slippery Rock last
Saturday.

“First of all, he’s a good athlete,"
said Pitt head soccer coach Joe
Luxbacher describing Torrence.
“Plus, he has the mental makeup. He
works real hard; he’s been working
hard for four years here.” Lux-
bacher added, “He has made himself
into a top goalie. It's a combination
of having natural ability, and he has
worked hard and developed that
ability."

That ability will come in handy
for the Panthers when they begin the
Big East Conference schedule on
Oct. 4, at Villanova. Torrence tied

the school record for shutouts in a
season with six last year and already
is halfway there this year with three.
Luxbacher credits Torrence with
‘being one of the better goalkeepers
he has tutored.

“Dave is a top goalkeeper,” said
Luxbacher. “There is no doubt
about it. It's hard to compare differ-
ent players because they’re with dif-
ferent types of teams, but deﬁnitely,
Dave is a top goalkeeper — the best I
have ever coached, personally
coached.”

As far as the Big East goes, Luxb-
acher is confident his goalkeeper will
hold his own in the Panthers’ first
year in conference play.

“Again, Dave is very capable, but
I haven’t seen all the Big East
teams," said Luxbacher. “I’m confi-
dent Dave can do the job at any
level.” Luxbacher added, “Dave is a
good goalkeeper, and I’m sure all the
Division 1 teams have good goal-
keepers, but Dave is right up among
the top.”

NCAA soccer is a very high level
of soccer to play. Is Torrence good

enough to play in the pros’?
“Well, professional sports is a
very select few, and it’s hard to say,”

said Luxbacher, who played five .

years of pro ball himself, splitting
time between the NASL,-the ASL
and the MISL. “He has the ability,
but he would have to continue to
develop as he has over the two years
I’ve been here as varsity coach.”
Luxbacher added, “The possibility
is there, but the professional level is
a very select few, so it would be very
competitive.”

For the time being, Torrence, a
chemical engineering ,major, will
concentrate on his duties as Pitt’s
goalkeeper. What lies in the future is
entirely up to Torrence.

“I don’t know if he would want to
even go that route anyway,” said
Luxbacher, referring to the pros.
“He’s a good student, an engineering
student.”

Honorable Mentionsi Charles
Gladman — The sophomore tail-

back from Akron, Ohio, rushed for V

103 yards on 20 carries during Pitt’s
10-7 loss to Ohio State. It was his
second consecutive 100-plus-yard
game of the year.

Steve Apke — The junior line-
backer from Cincinnati had 18 tack-
les against Ohio State. He is what
you would call an active linebacker.
He has 41 total tackles and leads the
Pitt defense in that category. The
next closest in the tackling category
is Tony Woods, and he trails Apke
by 17 tackles.

r itt-Georgetown

The University of Pittsburgh
announced today that the Pitt-
Georgetown basketball game on
Jan. 2, originally scheduled for Fitz-
gerald Field House, has been
switched to the Civic Arena. Game
time is at 7 p.m.

Last year, the Pitt-Georgetown
game on Jan. I9 drew a sellout
crowd of 16,532, a record for the
largest crowd ever to view a single
collegiate basketball game in the city
of Pittsburgh. The game was sold
out two weeks in advance, the first
time that had happened for colle-
giate basketball at the arena. The
Panthers fell to the Hoyas, 65-53.

This game will be the league
opener for the Panthers, the first
time they will have faced George-
town to tip off Big East competition.
Despite the loss of Patrick Ewing,
the Hoyas are’ still considered one of
the teams to beat for the Big East
title as they return nine of their top
ll players.

Pitt will play its I3 other home
games at Fitzgerald Field House.

0Was anyone really surprised by
San Francisco’s and Miami's open-
ing day losses two weeks ago? The
trend in the 1980s for Super Bowl
participants is to slip the following
season. Causes? Injuries and
healthy doses of complacency. Both
squads should make the playoffs,
but neither team will play their last
game in Super Bowl XX.

0Here’s a vote for the “hard luck”
team of I985 —- the Atlanta Falcons.
Dan Henning’s troops have been
beset by injuries, contract squabbles
and a great deal of poor luck. Five
years ago, the Falcons were on the
verge of becoming one of the
league’s best.

0This year's surprise may come
out of the Motor City. The Detroit
Lions have darted out to a 2-1 start
with wins over Atlanta and Dallas.
Their victory over the Cowboys was
quite impressive, with the Lions
jumping out to a huge early lead.
Imagine if Daryl Rogers had a
healthly Billy Sims to turn loose.

0Pittsburgh seems to have
improved considerably over last
year’s AFC Championship team. If
Chuck Noll allows his QB Mark
Malone to direct more aerials at
Lipps and stalwart Stallworth, the
Steelers may finally get their “one
for the thumb.”

Marty Schottenheimer is allowing
his ace rookie Bernie Kosar to
mature at a slow pace, putting no
pressure on him to take the starting
position. This investment of time
should pay off huge dividends in the
win column when Kosar does step in
as No. l.

Olt appears that the Dallas quar-
terback controversy has resurfaced.
After Danny White’s poor perfor-
mance against the Lions, Gary
Hogeboom now has the upper hand
in the situation. But after Hoge-
boom has his lackluster outing....

0Bud Grant has his Vikings ﬂying
high again. QB Tommy Kramer is
playing at the top of his game, while
the Vikes’ defense is dishing out its
share of hits. Safetyman Keith Note
is rapidly becoming one of the
league’s most exciting players. Look
for Minnesota to challenge Ditka’s
Bears for the NFC Central crown.

0This year’s “King Kong Imperso-
nation Award” will go to the
Washington Redskins. The Skins
are battered and aging and should

wind up near the bottom of the .

NFL‘s Empire State Building, the
NFC East.

0Finally, a Super Bowl predic-
tion. In SB XX, the Seattle Sea-
hawks will battle the St. Louis
Cardinals. Who will be the Big Bird?

known sports historians, sports
medicine authorities, sports psy-

_chologists, sportssociologists, and,

the real world after retiring from
competition, preparation of high
school athletes for world class com-
petition, current problems facing the
Olympics, sports psychology and
the Olympic athlete, the USOC and

'its sports medicine program, the

Tanner talks
drug ‘trail

in

(.UPl) — Pittsburgh Pirate man-
ager Chuck Tanner took the stand in
the federal drug trial of Curtis
Strong, the Philadelphia man
accused of selling drugs to major
league baseball players in
Pittsburgh.

Tanner says he once told ex-
Pirate Dale Berra that “an unsavory
looking" character, Strong, was
hanging around the team. But the
manager says he does not recall ever
warning Berra specifically to avoid
Strong. Berra, who now plays for
the Yankees, testified that after see-
ing Strong near the clubhouse,
Tanner said, “Don’t talk to that
gentleman.”

The Pitt Nlewsi--"Septernber I8;  I

But Tanner, called to the witness
stand by defense attorney Adam
Renfroe, denies Berra’s statement.
Instead, under cross-examination
by the prosecution, Tanner recalled
another incident. He_said the Pirates
were in Philadelphia when a coach
reported a man fitting Strong's des-
cription was seen around the team’s
hotel.

Tanner says his trainer called the
hotel bar and got Berra on the
phone. When asked what he said to
Berra, Tanner replied, “Be careful;
you have to be careful about gam-
bling and everything.”

Renfroe opened his case yesterday
and promised he will prove that his
client is being made a scapegoat by
“hero-criminal” ballplayers.

Byars bad foot
reset in cast

COLUMBUS (UPI) — Ohio
State’s All-America tailback Keith
Byars had his broken right foot
examined Monday and placed back
in a cast for at least another week.
The nation's leading scorer a year
ago broke the bone Sept. 2nd. He is
dearly missed by the Buckeyes. Ohio
State had only 48 yards rushing in its
10-7 victory over Pittsburgh
Saturday.

Tulane student
added in fixing
scandel

NEW ORLEANS (UPI) — A
ninth person formally was charged
with sports bribery in the point-
shaving scandal that led to the end of
men’s basketball at Tulane
University.

Ken Turkel, a -senior business
major, is the fourth non-player
charged in the case. He is the former
roommate of Gary Kranz, who has
been labeled -as the ringleader of the
scheme to bribe Tulane players to fix
games.

Prosecutors also said they will file
an appeal today, seeking to clear the
way for a re-trial of former Tulane
star John “Hot Rod” Williams. The
indictment against Williams was
thrown out by a state judge in late
August after

Andujar may not
have to testify

PITTSBURGH (UPI) St.
Louis pitcher Joaquin Andujar may
not be called to the witness stand in
the baseball drug trial in Pittsburgh.

The trial resumes tomorrow, but
sources in the case now say Andujar
is no longer considered .a potential
witness. '

The defense initially indicated
Andujar would be asked to testify
because an earlier witness said
Andujar bought cocaine from
defendant Curtis Strong. There was
no explanation for the apparent
change in defense plans.

Yesterday, Pittsburgh Pirates
manager Chuck Tanner testified. He
said he did—not recognize the alleged
coke dealer.

Anclerson ready to
join San Diego

SAN DIEGO (UPI) — Reports
indicate that the San Diego
Chargers reached a verbal agree-
ment to buy the contract of running
back Gary Anderson from the
Tampa Bay Bandits, pending appro-
val by the U.S. Football League.

Published accounts (in both the
San Diego Union and Los Angeles
Times) say the buy-out will cost San
Diego owner Alex Spanos $350,000.
The NFL Club reportedly will then
pay Anderson a $2 million salary
over four years.

Anderson was drafted in the first
round by the Chargers in 1983.

San Diego already has signed
other USFL defectors, including
running back Tim Spencerand wide
receiver Trumaine Johnson.

MINNEAPOLIS (UPI) — Relief
Pitcher Steve Howe was granted his
unconditional release by the Minne-

Howe admitted to club officials
that he used cocaine during an unex-
plained absence over the weekend.
Yesterday, he asked the Twins to be
let out of his contract to “devote his
immediate and full attention to his
personal problems an_d full
recovery.”

Howe had been missing since
Thursday night when. he appeared
on the ABC television show Night--
line, in Chicago. The guests were
discussing drug use in professional
athletics. .

The 27-year-old pitcherwas try-
ing to make a comeback with the
Twins after being released by the
Los Angeles" Dodgers earlier this
year. His stay "in Los ‘Angeles
included treatments for chemical
dependency and unannounced
departures. '

Howe was suspended for the 1984
season by then-baseball commis-
sioner Bowie Kuhn because of

Strat-O-Matic — baseball the old fashioned style

of  time). The .pitehin-g'staff-wiasi

I went home this weekend and I
found myself during time-outs in the
Alabama-Texas A&M game clean-
ing out my closet. My closet is sort of
my own personal archive, my Smith-
sonian Institute. It’s here that I keep
such artifacts as old pictures, an
inﬂatable Stanley Cup, old pictures,
broken cameras and telescopes, old
pictures, clothes that no longer fit
and old pictures.

Well, in one of the boxes I was
rummaging through, I came across a
Strat-O-Matic Baseball game. In
case you've never played or heard ‘of

I haven't played Strat-O-Matic in
over three years, now. If you ask me, I
got out just in time. With these salar-
ies, drug allegations and complaining
players, I don't know how the owners
today can stand it.

the game, Strat-O-Matic is a board
game played with cards, dice and a
cardboard baseball field.

Each major league player is a card
in this game (as so many of them are
in real life) and his possibilities for
getting on base, getting walked, get-
ting hit by a pitch or grounding out
are listed in rows on the card. Each
card is based on that player’s statis-
tics from the previous season.
Obviously, the better season that
player had, the better were his chan-
ces of getting on base. By the same
token, the better year a pitcher had,
the better his card and chances to get
the batter out are. It’s all very
mathematical and precise.

Until you roll the dice.

The game has about the same
order to it that electric football had.
It was this unpredictability that

‘
P,‘

allowed Bernie Carbo to go seven
for eight and Bill Caudillto throw
two no-hitters in a row.

We organized leagues, my Strat-
O-Matic friends and I. First we
picked a team — I was always the
Yankees — and we were allowed to
protect 10 players from our roster.
The other 15 players were gathered
from the pool of unprotected players
by way of a draft. ESPN usually did
not cover our draft, although it often
took as long to complete as the
NFL’s.

If there is one thing I learned from
all the years of playing Strat-O-
Matic, it’s that you really don’t
know your friends until they’re
down 7-2 in the bottom ofthe eighth
and a half-game out of first. It can
get ugly.

One of my friends, who was the
Boston Red Sox, actually shed tears
over a late season loss one year that
cost him the pennant. This kid was a
football player and just an all-
around macho kind of dude, but I’ll
be darned if the tears didn’t run.
when his Red Sox lost an extra-
inning game to the last-place Reds.
Woody Fryman beat him. Now
Woody must have been 40 then,.and
he had one of the most hit-soaked
cards in the league, but Woody
could not be had on that night. No,
sir, Woody pitched something like
16 scoreless innings until Louis Puj-
ols (a late-round Reds draft pick) hit
a two—out home run in the bottom of
the 21st. ~

Pujols was named league MVP in
a big surprise, just ahead of Larry
Bowa of the Phillies who hit around
.410. Another hindrance to the Puj-
ols vote was the Reds’ owner’s insis-
tence on pronouncing his star’s
name as Louis Pajollis.

Personally, I never met with much
success in the league. I think it was
mainly due to poor pitching. Joe

Neikro had a few decent years, and

Tom Seaver was a nice addition to

the staff. He was obtained in a very
controversial trade with .the White
Sox. But mostly my staff was has-
beens and never-weres: Luis Tiant,
Torn Burgmeir, Bob Moose (in the
early years) and Dennis Eckersley.
But the one thing that is nice
about the game is that you never
know who is going to have big years
or great games. Then one season, it
all came together for my Yanks. For
the first time, I was confident with
my team. I had a cast of defensive
geniuses — Ozzie Smith, Lou Whit-
taker, Rod Carew, Rickey Hender-

son an_d Dave Winfield (years ahead

strengthened by the addition of
Mario Soto, Jim Palmer and ‘Bert

Blyleven (who never complained on V

my team). . .
I had a seven-game lead going into

' the pennant drive and was already

counting my World Series winnings
when Willie Randolph and Rick
Cerone were both injured and lost
for 10 games. Cerone was having a
fantastic year behind the plate — he
was hitting in the neighborhood of
.380 with 10 homers.

' Well, to make a long story short,
Mario Soto pitched two consecutive

 

     

‘no-hitters In the final few games, and ’ 1

I held on to win by a game and a half.
Needless to say, with Randolph and .
Cerone back for the playoffs, I
coasted to a World Series cham-
pionship in ﬁve games over the hap-
less Expos.

I haven’t played Strat-O-Matic in
over three years ‘now. If you ask me,
I got out just in time. With these
salaries, drug allegations and com-
plaining players, I don't know how
the owners today can stand it.

One more thing: In all the years ‘I
ran my Yankees, never once did I
ﬁre my manager.

Strat-O-Matic baseball swept the nation during the seventies, from
the unemployed...to the politicians...to the criminals.
