STUDENTS ARE DENIED CHRISTMAS TRIP BASKETBALL SEASON OPENS  
FRIDAY NIGHT WITH WAYNESBURG

PROMISED BY GLEE CLUB MANAGER,

Glowing Statements Made at:

Start of Year Fail to Realize-
Men Work F aithfully For As-
surances Offered.

REASON SHOULD BE GIVEN.

~ At the beginnin.g of the current year

the manager of the musical clubs of the
‘University appeared before the student
body_ with a tale of glowing optimism,

that was at once infectious and cheer-

ing. The story of the success of the
glee and mandolin clubs was painted
so brightly, that even the most green
ofthe meek Freshmen class was stirred
by the ﬁery phrases of the aspiring
manager. Chief among the tempting
musical morsels placed before the awe-
struck students was the prospect of an
alluring Christmas trip; cities of all
magnitudes and import were included in
the itinerary, which, compared to a
Clark cruise around the world, was a
mere bagatelle. The ardor and the
loyalty of the students of the Univers-
ity was appealed to, in such a strenuous

-manner that volunteers for the musical

clubs sprang up like the proverbial
mushroom. Christmas,» with its prom-
ise of, an enjoyable trip was worth
working for and the men were quite
willing to practice faithfully for the
minor concerts held before Thanks.giv—
.ing time and the big State-Pitt affair
Thanksgiving evening.

To use the expression of the small
boy, the manager of the musical clubs

has failed to “make good” and the Uni-‘

versity men were deprived of ‘a pleasure
that belonged to them. ‘Not alone this,
but, it seems as if thie musical manager
has suffered his machine to undergo the
hardship of a ﬂat tire and the bottom of

the bucket has fallen entirely from that

oratory we were permitted to enjoy at
the start of the present year.

.The VVeek1y is in receipt of some
citicism regarding the management of
the musical clubs, which is, to say the
least, not very creditable to the gentle-
men in charge. In respect, however,

for the integrity, which we entertain‘

for the manager and his capable assist-
ant, We refrain from any comment at
the present moment, but, we do suggest
that Mr. Cunningham present a state-
ment WHY THE CHRISTMAS TRIP
WAS NOT ARRANGED AND ALSO
A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF HIS FUT-
URE PLANS: ‘

The columns of this paper are open
for that purpose. ,

Noted Visitor
Praises University

Co-operative Plan Comes in For
Favorable Wordsat Hands of
Distinguished Man-—ls Pleased
With Weekly.

The University had a distinguished
visitor last week in the -person of Pro-
fessor Charles H. Chase of Tufts col-
lege. Professor Chase is the instruc-
tor of steam engineering in the col-
lege. Thevisitor was shown over the
buildings of the University by Doc-
tor Bishop, dean of theengineering
schools, who explained the co—oper-
ative plan now in force here. After
thoroughly scrutinizing the equip-
ment of the institution, and the prep-
arations made’ for the future, the vis-
itor endorsed the policy of the Uni-
versity very highly, especially com-
mended was the co—operative scheme
of engineering school. Professor
Chase, being shown a copy of the
PITT WEEKLY, was astonished at
the character of the publication and

very gravely asked Dr. Bishop if the
students of this institution put out

the paper. Receiving an afﬁrmative
answer, the professor replied by say-
ing, “that paper would be an asset of
any institution.”

by the latest announcement which
carries with it the information that
Esperanto is to be taught in the“regu—
lar curriculm. The work is to be in
charge of Mr. J. M. Clifford, Jr., who
is fully conversant with the language.

The University is fortunate in secur-‘

ing such an authority on the lan-
guage;, it is said, that Mr. Clifford is
one- of the leading Esperantists of"
the country.

DR. FRIESELL IS HONORED.

Captain Weger Will Plan Fast
Team on Floor for First Game

-Old Stars in the Game.
STUDENTBOOKS ARE coon

Friday evening ‘the Varsity basket-
ball ﬁve under the leadership of Cap-
tain Weger, will make its initial bow
to the students in the Gardens when
Waynesburg College will be here to
nieet the University team. The men
have been" training faithfully since
basketball was granted by ‘the athletic
committee some weeks ago. The cap-
tain has as a basis the stars of two
years ago, Farmer, Lindsay, Budd
and himself to build up a winning
combination. Another man who seems.
to possess the qualiﬁcations neces_
sary for the Varsity is Campbell, a
former Homestead High school
passer of no mean abili'ty. These ﬁve
men, coupled with the.large num-
ber of unknown quan/tities comprising
the squad, will likely round out an
aggregation capable’ of putting up a’
ﬁrs-t~class game on the ﬂoor this win-
ter.

The auditorium has been arranged
in the best possible way for basket-
ball, with 'the limited means at hand".
It is -hoped to have a large number
of s.tudents present next ’F:id:‘+y
evening to whoop things up for Old
Uni. The student books will be ac-

, cepted as admission tickets as usual.

The athletic committee made a
special concession in permitting the
game this winter and it is now .1p'to
the students. to show their 3.pD.';‘.1'c1-_
tion by turning out in large numbers
to the games. ITS UP TO YOU.

THE FRESH CAPS.

The University of Pittsburgh has
two splendid institutions, the student

' senate and the Sophomore class, both
- endowed with the power of regulating

the ‘affairs of the Freshmen class" to
some small extent. The traditions of
the University have always implied
the wearing of a green cap by the in-
coming class until a time designa-ted
The most import-
ant 'means to enforce the ruling is the
activity of the second year class, who,
by divers ways can humiliate the
tender ones to such a degree that it

‘is more proﬁtable to enter the portals

of the University with a cap than
without one. H
facts were gently-brushed aside last

,week when the “cubs” returned . . . . ..

they wear Freshmen caps? Well, the
idea of such important men in the

institution appearing in headgear be-

neath their dignity! Whether you

’ like it or not Mr. Upperclassmen and
Sophomores, such is the condition of_
affairs-in the University of Pittsburgh

at the present moment. Have things
come to such a pass that the yearlings

dominate in student" government? It
has been our misfortune to criticise

the senate verv harshly during the
present year and the fault ﬁnding has
done about as much good as the estab-
lis-hment of an express line to Mars.
What of the Fresh. cap night cele-
bration? Fallen absolutely ﬂat, hasn’t
it? Why? Simply because you "and
the Sophomores are afraid to “start
something.” It is getting very_ di_s--
gusting to see the first yearimen ap-
propriating all the privileges of an
upperclassman in less than a year.
Only the other morning a group of
Fresh came into chapel and proceeded
to sit with the Senior class, but, were
very promptly and properly ejected

_ and later treated to a little enjoyment

on an upper ﬂoor. There is sufficient
time for both the Senate and the
Sophomores to begin to clean house.
May the good work begin at once!

Professor Chase knows a good
thing when he sees it. It is hardly
necessary to say we chased after him
for the compliment.

reason why the conversation of the
college student should not be free
from much of the talk of the street;
the addition of a few wordstat times
does add highly to the effect, but, in
the long run something else would
have served the purpose just as well.
It seems only reasonable to believe
that a course in daily conversation
would be immensely proﬁtable to all
classes of students in this and every
other institution in the country. We
do not mean to slight the linguistic
ambition of anyone, but, it appears

the yirtute of a masterful native
speech than to urge the study of a
language created from. the mind of a
d_reamer.

THE BASKETBALL SEASON.

Friday evening the basketball sea-
son of the University will be formally
opened in the Garden auditorium with
the Waynesburg college ﬁve as t-he at-
traction. After an idle period, lasting
over two years, the athletic authori-
tiesyhave restored the popular winter
game to the students with the hope
that it-will be liberally supported by
iall. Many are of the opinion that the
game should not have been’ resurrec-
‘ted until next year, when the‘ new
gymnasium will be ready for occu-
pancy—there‘may be a great deal of
solid logic in the argument, but, it
looks as if the proper time to reinstate
the game is right now. It is'\true, the
players are ' handicapped and the
schedule is both

tion of the schedule brings to mind
the slight wave of criticism, which is
being directed toward the graduate
manager in the matter of a weak
schedule. In justice to Mr. Hurst,
the WEEKLY wishes to go on. record
with the statement that it is no fault
of his that the list of games seems
trivial. It must be borne in mind that
a very late start was given the man-
ager to compile a number of .engage—
ments with the leading colleges, the

 most of whom had already ﬁlled their

icards for the year. It is twice as

smoking room over the bracing inspir-

ation of Father Nicotine, than it is

short and inconse-§
quent to some degree, but a nu-5‘
cleus is beinrr formed -for next winter,{have a meeting before commencement.
which will have great value. The men-[Announcement will be given in ample

leasy to arrange a schedule in the

twith resolutions. to attain the result
desired. For a few days it is really
wonderful what resolutions can do;
lthe faculty members begin to think
tthat the day of miracles is not past
;.and that the impossible must some-
Etime be capable of accomplishment.
‘The aspiring student, though, surveys
lhirnself with the horrible thought in
‘mind that he is working too hard and
{must seek a rest and there is the end
lot the man who is fond of the begin-
iing of the term. Last week the same
iold type was in evidence in the Uni-
;versity and the end of the present
‘week will ﬁnd the same old result. . . .
‘[back in the rut again. The winter
lterm offers a splendid chance for real

much more to the point to exhortl work, -and the man who passes the op-

lportunity by is not going to be on
lthe credit side of the personal ledger
{when the year is at an end.

FACULTY CONSPICUOUS.

‘ In the news columns will be found
la complete list of the institutes and
{conventions at which members of the
!faculty attended during the recent
recess. A thorough study of the ar-
ticle reveals the fact that the Univers-
ity of Pittsburgh was given much
{prominence-by its faculty, which is
the best criterion of the standing of
the University in "outside circles-. It
is both gratifying andencouraging to
note the splendid enthusiasm shown
by thejnstructors of the University.

Many students saw the upper por-
tionof the campus for the ﬁrst time
last week when the photo of. the
Trees stadium site appeared in THE
WEEKLY. "

It is understood the Senate is to

ftime, in order that no one dies of
;‘heart failure.

i

Soon be time for that OWL to be
lblinking its eyes. It is said the edi-
ltors are trying to keep their Plans in
the dark—we will see later.

A Freshman viewing his report card,
for the ﬁrst time last week exclaimed
_in a loud voice, “Oh Gee” and was
seen no more.

Old Penn is like all the rest of
them. Very much patterned after the
vaudevil.le houses—strong on “speci-

; alities.”

The aftermath of that lecture on

Esperanto is a severe one. The lan-

guage is to be taught here.

That college student arrested for
robbery in an Ohio town, certainly
did take things by storm.

Every thing wasmoving at the
checker club meeting last Friday
evening.

THE NAVY MAY BALK
ON PLAYING AGAIN
ON FRANKLIN FIELD.

That the Army-Navy football game
will not be played on Franklin Field,
Philadelphia, next year is the grow-
ing conviction of the athletes of the
Naval Academy here. The contract
entered into by the Army, Navy and
the University of Pennsylvania for the
use of the athletic ﬁeld has expired
and a new contract is to be drawn. It
is doubtful if Navy will sign. Under
the contract, Army, Navy and Penn-
sylvania get one—third of the tickets
eacli. Navy insists that this is not a
fair distribution, declaring that Penn-
sylvania is not entitled to so many,
Pennsylvania, for th’e use of the ﬁeld,
declines to accept fewer tickets. Itis
understood that tentative propositions
have been made looking towards tak-
ing the great gridir/on contest either
to the Polo Grounds or American
League Park in New York. a

CREDITSDUE THE PRESS. A

Breach of Newspaper Etiquettes is '

Committed Last Week Through
Rush Attendant Upon Va-
A cation Issue.

The splendid cut, which appeared at
the head of the issue last week is due

entirely to the kindness of the city ’

editor of the Pittsburg Press and the
staff photographer. Through an in-
advertant error credit was not given
the proper source, for which, the edi-
tors take this occasion to offer an
apology. Many wondered why the
title of the picture was not given,
but, it seemed only proper to leave
that out as every student has, by this
time, memorized the site upon which
the great Trees stadium is to be
erected.

FRATS IN THE DIRECTORY.

The University is s_ending requests
to the various fraternities to have
their telephone numbers listed under
the head of the University of Pitts-
burgh, as well as in their separate
places in the book. The advantage of
the plan is two fold and it is hoped
that the societies will lend their co-
operation in ‘the I matter.

Students Find Registration a Time to

l
l

A notice which was sent to all the:
members of the faculty last weekp
very plainly deﬁned that the students
must show their registration cards
properly receipted before being allowed
entrance to a class. The rule has been
heard of before in this institution,
but the success was never noticeable.
Last week, however, the scenes were
very much changed_ and the beauty of
the decree was sadly evident to the
fallow who had neglected to receive
the paternal check in time. Seriously
speaking, the plan is an excellent one
and should always work in the future.

Interest Shown in Chess and Checker,»
Club.

Last Friday night, quite a number
of students turned out to 203 State

the good old games of chess and
checkers. It is hoped that an interest
will be shown in these games by the
students. Friday night ofieach Week
is the date set for the meeting of the
club.

Rats, cats and ants are made to run

PENN PASSES DRASTIC RULE BARRING
SPECIAL STUDENTS FROM ATHLETICS

Western Elevens To Be Dropped From Red and
1 Blue Schedule To Make Way
_ For Yale and Harvard

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 5.—The
Athletic Association of the Univers-

ity of Pennsylvania at a secret meet-
ing passed an eligibility rule which
will prevent all but academic students
taking part in any varsity events.
This rule, which was passed at the
suggestion of Dr. Carl VVilliams,
means that Penn again will take its
football
games and practically all games with
Western colleges, after next fall, will
be eliminated. After next year there
will be no Michigan—Penn football
game, but instead will be substituted
2. Harvard—Penn game.

There are two reasons for the new
rule. The most important is that
Penn wishes to compete with Yale,
‘Harvard and Princeton on the grid-
iron; the second because experience
has taught that games With Western
colleges are not a success ﬁnancially
and fail absolutely when it comes to

THE PITT WEEKLY

claiming the championship football
eleven for Penn when the hardest
game of the year is with Michigan,
which has not matched strength with
Yale, Harvard or Princeton.

The drastic effect of the new rule
is best shown by the fact that of the
20 Pennsylvania ‘athletes, who re-
ceived their letters last year, eleven
are “special course” men, being either
in the medical or engineering branch
of the college. These men are the-
best athletes in the college. They are
Ramsdell, Marks, Radyear, Wolfarth,
Kaufmann, Sommers, Mercer, Ken-
nedy, Young, Keough and Harring-
ton. All but three of these men had
planned to return to college and take I
an active part in athletics. ‘

The new rule will take effect No-.
vember 30, this year, which allows the
“special course” men to take part in
all events until the end of the athletic
year’ of 1911.

COLLEGE BOY HAS TAKING
WAY.

Freshman In Ohio Wesleyan in the
Role of Bold Holdup Man.

A college student in the role of
daring daylight robber was the dis-
closure made in Marion Ohio last
week_in the arrest of Robert P. Crist,
aged 19 years, freshman and Greek
letter fraternity man at Ohio Wes—
leyan University at Delaware, on a
charge of robbing a jewelry store.

Crist is said to have made a con-
fession to the police, saying fast col-
lege life, tooimuch society and poker

forced him to borrow money, and hav-

ing lived beyond his means/he was

unable to pay his debts falling due

PAPER.

Clever Paper is Prepared,‘ for the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers by Professor
Stewart of the Engin-
eering School.

The most recent issue of the Journ-
al of the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers, contains a very
meritorious article by Professor Reid

T. Stewart of the University faculty.

The paper deals with the stresses in
the wall of a tube exposed to an ex-
ternal ﬂuid pressure and shows them
to be the same character as those in
a column having ﬁxed ends. The
worth of the work can best be ap-
preciated ‘by the fact that it is being
reprinted" for _
among engineering authorities.

SENIORS HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

The dignity of the Senior class was
seriously assailed last /week by a trio
of offending Freshmen. Not content
to sit in the space allo'tted to them
the Fresh strayed over to the,sacred
precincts of the Seniors during chapel
hour, which, according to the tradi-
tion of Senior classes since the tune
of Kitty Elston, came as librarian‘, is
‘the unpardonable sin. The Greenies
were very promptly requested to
change their nuarters and invited up
stairs after divine services were con-
cluded, where a program of varied
vocal and oratorical merit was ren-
dered by the Fresmen. §

Doctor Bishop, dean of the school
of engineering, is shortly to erect a
