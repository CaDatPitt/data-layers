Safari traded for relief

BEN GREINER
Staff Writer

The sky was unbelievably beautiful that
October night in 2003; even the greatest
poet couldn’t describe its beauty in words, a
few Pitt students said. As the orange sun set
over the Indian Ocean and the S.S. Universe
Explorer steamed toward Africa from India,
Pitt students and Semester at Sea partici-
pants Brandon Cohen and Tom Silverman
had no idea that shortly, their lives would
never be the same again.

The next day, the two men saw a small
flyer that would change their lives. It read:
“Looking for an alternative to a safari?”
Cohen and Silverman had no clue that in a
few short days, they’d witne.ss things so
heartwarming, yet horrific, that they could-
n’t help but leave the experience as different
people. .  

While en route to Africa, people aboard
the ship donated whatever they could to help
the refugees: clothes, food, books and toi-
letries, among other things.

“One kid only had two pairs of pants —
he gave us one to donate,” Cohen said.

After clocking in Tanzania, Cohen,
Silverman and about 20 other students from
various colleges, including Stanford
University and the University of California,
Los Angeles boarded a chartered plane
scheduled by Stanford activist and student
Kjerstin Erickson.

Despite the warnings of the United
Nations, Pitt, and the Tanzanian govern-
ment, the group ﬂew to the town of Kigoma,
Tanzania with roughly 1,300 pounds of
donations. V

While their fellow shipmates were expe-
riencing the thrill of an African safari,
Cohen and Silverman were experiencing
what they called a “modern day Holocalist.”
They were in a place riddled by terrible dis-
eases such as AIDS, smallpox, Ebola and
leprosy —— a place so bad, the life expectan-
cy was only 38. '

PATRICK YOEST
Staff Writer

When Jewish professors and intellectuals escaped Nazi
Germany before and during the Holocaust, many came to the
United States seeking a more inclusive society.

The American South, entrenched in the segregated cus-
toms of “Jim Crow,” hardly embodied the ideal society that
Jewish refugee-scholars sought. In fact, Jim Crow laws in
Southern states created social regimes that were racially
divided and, with few exceptions, unequal. '

But some refugee-scholars found 'an unlikely home:
black colleges. As depicted in the ﬁlm “From Swastika to
Jim Crow,” which was presented to a group of local students,

"Wednesday night, Jewish professors taught black students,
developed friendships in black communities of the South,
and formed bonds of long-lasting signiﬁcance. .

These are just the kinds of bonds that Hillel’s Jewish
Student Life Coordinator Jackie Braslawsce hopes to create.
By bringing Hillel and Pitt’s Black Action Society together,
Braslawsce believes that she can pave the way for other new

“A lot of times, people in the
position to help don’t always know
they can help,” Silverman said.

Led by a tour guide, the group
met with relief workers and

refugees. While in Kigoma, the ‘’

group spent the next few days help-
ing the refugees and listening to the
touching personal stories of those
far from homeiyet close to death.

After returning to Pittsburgh,
Cohen and Silverman knew they
couldn’t forget their experiences in
Africa. In fact, they mentioned how
they’d like to I inform future

relationships on campus as well.

“Hopefully, by ‘spreading ties
between these two groups, it’ll. spread
to other groups as well,” Braslawsce
said. “I want to try to bridge these
gaps.”

More than 25 students _viewed
“From Swastika to Jim Crow”! in the
Public Health Auditorium Wednesday
night, in an event that also included dia-
logue and small-group reﬂection. The
film, which showed alternating images
of Nazi violence towards Jews and vio-

lent police suppres'sio'n'of black citizens =

in the United States, suggested similar-
ities in the treatment of blacks and
Jews.

Mark Shabason, a Pitt student who
attended the event, believes the similar-
ities are striking.

“We always think of America as the
land of freedom, where everyone has
equal rights,” Shabason said. “There
were a lot of parallels between the Jews
in Germany and African-Americans [in
the United States].”

The Anti-Defamation League,
which screens “From Swastika to Jim
Crow” at campuses nationwide to
improve relations between blacks and
Jews, facilitated the event.

According to Vanessa Gerideau,
president of Black Action Society, the
event is not a reaction to any particular
incident, but a proactive measure to
establish chaimels of discourse.

“We’re both minorities. If any inci-
dents occur, we already have that com-
munication,” Gerideau said.

V Many students were not aware of
the phenomenon of Jewish professors
ﬁnding academic homes in black uni-

versities. Encountering more insidious
forms of anti-Semitism and nativism in
well-known and predominantly white
American universities, refugee-scholars
found that they were very welcome at
schools with names like Tougaloo

_College, Hampton Institute and North

Carolina Central University.
Black universities were generally
exempt from segregation laws, so white

professors and staff often worked side

by side with blacks.

The interaction between the once
unfamiliar cultures tended to be a fruit-
ful one. John Herz, a refugee-scholar
who taught political science at Howard
University, recalled in the film that he
“assumed that his black students would
have more interest and a better under-

standing in fascism, Nazism and

racism.” -

Dina Clark Rodriguez, an Anti-
Defamation League facilitator, aimed to
get students talking about their differ-
ences in a thoughtful way. She saidthat,
too often, students mix only within
groups with which they are familiar.

She’ and another facilitator, Cindy,

Goodman-Leib, sparked conversation
in several groups of six or seven that
gathered around the’ auditorium.

“If you don’t have to think about
your experience or what’s going on in
the world, change can’t happen here,”
Rodriguez said.

By the end of the event, Hillel’s
Braslawsce was confident that the story
of refugee scholars, and the broader
message of mutual respect, had been
presented well.

“I see it as a starting point. The 25,
30 students that were here ... they are
the starting point of something that will
be great.”

“Passion” should cut anti—Semitism

Mel Gibson’s upcoming movie, “The
Passion of the Christ,” is mired in contro-
versy once again. This time it doesn’t
relate to Pope John Paul II — who saw the
movie, but did not comment on it, con-
trary to what was widely reported —- but
to the movie’s content, which many View
as anti-Sernitic.

Gibson has stated that he wanted to
show the Passion as it happened. Yet
many people who saw the movie at select
screenings‘ ﬁnd its Violent portrayal of
Jews disturbing.

There are differences between docu-
ments of history and documents of faith. If
Gibson is to present “The Passion” as a
historical account, he should stick to the
closest thing we have to a historical
account of the cruciﬁxion — the Gospels.

Rabbi Gary Bretton—Granatoor, an
inter-faith consultant with the Anti-
Defamation League, who saw “The
Passion” in a Miami screening, criticized
its portrayal of Jews. In a Reuters report,
he stated that the much of the ﬁlm’s gore
was not based on the Gospels, but on the
writings of a 19th century nun, in the book
“The Dolores Passion of Our Lord Jesus
Christ.”

If Gibson went to the eﬂort of reviv-
ing dead languages —-— the ﬁlm is in Latin
and Aramaic, an ancient vernacular lan-
guage, as well. as Hebrew —- then he
shouldn’t throw in an obvious anachro-
nism. Moreover, he shouldn’t try to pass it
off as the canon interpretation of the cru-

ciﬁxion.

But most of the hubbub is aimed at
the exclusion or inclusion of a scene based
on the Gospel of Matthew 27:25, where a
Jewish high priest declares a blood curse
on the Jewish people, making them
responsible for the death of Jesus.

It was this sentence that fueled much
of the anti—SerIiitic fervor that followed
Passion plays in the Middle Ages. And it
was that type of anti-Seiriitic fervor that
the Catholic Church wanted to avoid
when it dropped the whole blood curse
issue at the Second Vatican Council in
1965.

As the Pope stated in 1997,
“Erroneous and unjust interpretations of
the New Testament regarding the Jewish
people and their alleged culpability have
circulated for too long, engendering feel-
ings of hostility toward this people.”

The New York Times reported Feb. 4
that this scene would be cut from Gibson’s
ﬁlm, though Gibson has not commented
on this. But the rest of the ﬁlm should take
into account both historical account and
modern ideas and interpretations.

Showing Jews as antagonists in the
Passion — especially in a ﬁlm that will be
widely released and hugely marketed to
churches — neglects history. Jesus was
Jewish, as were many other players in his
story. Adjusting the movie is not a matter
of political correctness, but one of simple
correctness, and Gibson should change his
ﬁlm accordingly.

Viewing Oakland as art: the secret poetry of broken bottles

In my more grossly sentimental
moments, I sometimes think the only
thing Oakland needs is a poet capable of
recording its personality. On certain
autumn or late spring evenings, the
town seems idyllic. The sun rises and
sets in the Cathedral’s windows, high-
lighting a sky that is bluer for all its
grayness. -

Frisbees and footballs are over the
lawn, and the air is spiced with cigarette
smoke as cars‘begi’n to switch on their
headlights. The restaurants and pubs are
bustling with life, inviting sidewalk traf-
ﬁc to come in and relax for a bit. These_
transition months blossom in the cracks
between sweltering summer and frozen
winter, and I often consider them while
walking to class in February, with

everyone heavily wrapped in overcoats ‘

and seasonal depression.

True, ‘Oakland isn’t exactly a post-
card community. Its warm evenings and
active nights are religiously followed by
ghost-town mornings, broken—bottle
sidewalks, streets dotted \here with
vomit, there with blood and all over

with a kind of spiritual dust. I

I If I could reconcile the nights with
the mornings and so purify it all, I

’ would. But as it is, I must also appreci-

ate -these blocks for their raw’ human-
ness and for the potential they host.
Oakland is ‘home to thousands of
people who believe college is about
sowing wild oats; living today because
the business world will effectively kill
you tomorrow. It’s a depressing idea,
one that "might be countered if more of
us would develop a greater ‘sense of

7 nobility in our own lives. -
Walk any-‘street in any town and you

walk with history, alongside the ghosts
of those who walked it before you.
Oakland. must have millions of them —
frat boys and sorority girls, leaders and
followers, alcoholics and addicts, ath-
letes, geniuses, dropouts, and normal

- kids. All of whom donated a portion of

their lives to these streets and then
moved on to be replaced by us, and so
we will also be replaced. Much of
Oakland’s charm is invisible and his-

. toric, but still as evident as the uneven

sidewalks, . barred windows and
disheveled sofas. . '

Many streets are lined with houses
that might truly be haunted. Student
lifestyles and expectations are generally
relaxed enough to make s1um—lording
the sweetest gig in town. _

g But if the houses aren’t all polished
like certain other areas, they are richer
in character. There’s something wholly
honest about a house ‘with broken ‘shut-
ters and shag carpet, acoziness that says

“I am ‘what I am.” In my house, we .

break things from time to time, and.it’s
no big deal. Not breaking anything
means you’re not doing anything, and
then missing out on cracks and splits

and scars, which have a
value all their own.

On certain sunny after-
noons, I’ll spend hours on
Craig Street browsing the
bookstores, sometimes eat-
ing at the Thai Place Cafe or
watching CMU students
discuss robotics in hushed
and hurried tones.
Sometimes after intramural
games, I’ll retire to Denny’s

chain that comes through.
Oakland is itself artistic
— all of Pitt’s yellowish,
grayish, tannish buildings
remain- stained with steel-
era soot. At certain points in
the evening, the view over
Panther Hollow is inspiring.
Each street is webbed with
tangled power lines and
framed with porches. The

strategy over‘ a pitcher and the jukebox.
There are concerts, sporting events, and

-two unique local businesses for every

grass in front of Soldiers’
and Sailors’ is as lush as it is
forbidden. Every third parked car is
adorned with a boot. It’s a work con-
stantly in progress, with changing land-

scapes, architecture and inhabitants. Old
bricks, rusted rails, broken glass, wind-
ing ivy vines and forgotten legacies
deﬁne just about any residential street
you can think of, yet each is somehow
singular. .

If Oakland does not get better with
age, it does get more interesting, like a
bottle of wine shattered and tossed hap-
hazardly on the sidewalk. Ours is a town
with complexities that often go uncon-
sidered — they are rusted complexities,
but not any less endearing for their rust.

Hey pretty, you want first pick of our kidneys?

white shirt, and a linty blue t—shirt,
and standing next to a black light.

Still catching our breath after the
sight of this forbidden cavern of won-
ders, we were further bombarded
with sexy coeds, as our friend intro-
duced us to more and more and more
women, who, suffice it to say, would
not normally have talked to us unless
they needed a kidney and we were the
only people around.

We, of course, would gladly have
donated said kidney and thrown in a
thyroid gland to seal the deal.

We began to attemptithe “Dutch

courage” method of conversation,
repeatedly refilling our cups from the
readily available keg, while utilizing
whatever rudimentary social skills we
picked up from watching “The O.C.”
last week. These girls, however, were
not impressed by our grunts and “If I
were a serial killer, you’d be the first
body hanging in my basement” pick-
up lines. Realizing we were out of our
league, we drank with renewed aban-
don. As the party thinned out, we
chatted with several of the remaining
sexy people, and, striking no oil, we
slunk out the door, vomiting along
the way.

Although there were no attractive

lesbians or unicorns in attendance,
we realized that we had just discov-
ered a mythical beast right in our
backyard.

For once in our pitiful lives, we
had managed to gain entry to — and
crash and burn at —— a perfect party.
We may never again have such an
experience, but our drunken memo-
ries and our puke-stained shoes
ensure that, to paraphrase Naked
Eyes, there will always be something
there to remind us.

Joe and Collin ’s next quest is to find
the perfect box social. E—mail them at

Directed by: Gavin O’Connor

A&E Editor

It’s a “Miracle” that a hockey film
this good ever got made. .

Football, baseball — hell, even
golf — they have their movies.
Hockey, however, has been unfairly
neglected. Sure, there’s “The Mighty
Ducks,” “Slap Shot” and even
“Mystery, Alaska.” But where’s the
film, that shows a real love for hockey,
a love of the game that forces people to
ﬁght through more pain than they ever
thought they could feel, a love of the
game that drives people to give their all
for the betterment of their team instead
of their contract? It’s certainly not
“Slap Shot 2,” the best sports ‘film this
side of the “Rocky” outtakes — excuse
me, “Rocky V.” -—~

Out of nowhere comes ‘?Miracle,”
the hockey‘ film to end all hockey films.

And how could it be anything but?
A ﬁlm about one of the great moments
of modern American sports —— the ’SO
U.S. Olympic hockey team pulling the

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906 A

Kurt Russell is a part of a “Miracle”

upset in the semi—fmal medal round,
beating the Soviets on the road to win-
ning the gold medal? A movie where
Herb Brooks and Craig Patrick, names
as important to Pittsburgh hockey as
they are to U.S.hockey, being portrayed
on screen? Kurt Russell playing
Brooks?. A hockey movie that isn’t
bogged down with gross oversentimen-
tality and that presents the game with a
reverence never before seen on ﬁlm?

“Miracle” should hit so hard your
kids are going to feel it.

Thankfully, it doesn’t disappoint.
From the writing and direction to the
guys who portray the ’SO squad —
Russell especially -— everyone has an
obvious love for the game and that
moment at Lake Placid.

Kurt Russell absolutely becomes
Herb Brooks. From his way of speak-
ing and his mannerisms to the
wardrobe, Russell nails it. And unlike
watching him in other films, where his
previous roles — like Snake Plisskin
and Jack Burton — get in the way of
getting into his character, he is easily
and quickly believable as Brooks. After
just a few minutes, you forget that
Russell is playing one of the legends of
hockey coaching. .

Similarly, Gavin O’Connor’s direc-
tion takes watching hockey on film to a
new level. It’s not a slapstick comedy,

nor an uplifting-for-uplifting’s-sakei

ﬁlm. It’s hockey as hockey. You can
feel the players’ pain when they get hit.

presenting

_on

When they’re in the locker room, you
can feel and smell the heavy, sweaty,
drippy atmosphere. You can feel the

exhaustive exuberance when one of the '
"skinny, American kids scores a goal by

ﬁghting through lines of big, aged
Soviets‘.
The moments ‘*

off the ice are
equally reverent,
the
team and its
coaches in a light
of unsung sports
heroes who play
for love of the
game, rather than
just glory. This
sentiment is par— .
ticularly apt now,
as the NHL stands
on the precipice of
a potential season- ‘
long walkout next S

in mind that they were ..college-aged
hockey players. So infer what you will.
But if Disney didn’t produce the ﬁlm,
it’s possible that we would have gotten

‘the end-all representation of Brooks

and his team, warts and all.
But, ultimately, this is a small quib-

season, brought

in part by

demands of huge

contracts creating devastation in small
markets.

Given this realism, however, the
lack of character ﬂaws, like a predispo-
sition to swearing in the locker room, is
quite pronounced. Because “Miracle”
is a Disney film, things like heavy—duty
profanity aren’t going to be present.
And maybe the members of the ’SO US
team weren’t big on- cussing, but bear

ble. “Miracle” is an amazing ﬁlm, both
as just a film — it’s a wonderful story,
acted with class and talent, and skillful-

ly written and directed —— and as a
sports movie —— it’s “Rocky 2” for
hockey fans.

In theaters without a whole lot
worth watching, “Miracle” stands out;
shining brilliantly like an Olympic gold
medal.

anccllcd shows are

coming back

There’s a lot of television out’
there. Tons, in fact. There are lots of
24-hour channels that want program-
ming and take as much, if not more,
than they need.

Needless to say, some of these
programs ‘aren’t exactly “high -quali-
ty,” and no program has ever lasted
longer than 20 years. Although some
believe “The Simpsons” could pass
the tenure of “Gunsmoke” in five
years, the producers of “The
Simpsons” think they won’t last more
than another two years. - :

With the advent of shows on
DVD, a program’s years, and success,
is‘ of marginal importance. All that
matters is how long it will take to get
on DVD. Take, for example, the show
“Fireﬂy.”

“Fireﬂy” was a »-show that lasted
less than a year. Only 11 shows aired
during primetime, and three didn’t
make it to the screen. But, 10 and
behold, when it was released on DVD,-

the 14 episodes actually sold.

The reason why? No matter what
a program is ‘about, there’s almost-
always going to be a following. It’s
pretty logical. Different people like
different things, so if a program gets a
million or so Viewers during prime-
time, it’ll probably get cancelled, but
it will be lucrative enough for the
broadgcastirig company to release
50,000 DVDS. People who liked the
show will get to see every_ episode
whenever they want, broadcasting

companies make some money, and

everyone’s happy. .
The same has been happening to
“Futurama”” The first and second sea-
sons. have been selling really well,
especially for an underachieving,
poorly advertised Fox program. The
past five years for “Futurama” haven’t
been the easiest, especially with con-
stant time slot changes and the show’s
not holding up to Fox’s high standards
of ’Sunday night» programming -

_ despite the fact that Fox never liked to

advertise for the program. ‘
Of course, they V cancelled
.“Futurama” last year, rearranged the
order, and filled*- the spot with that
God-awful “Oliver Beene.”
Either way,’ “Futurama”
enjoyed the fruits of the DVD after-
life. Syndication on Cartoon Network,
a few hundred thousand DVD sales —
no one can really say this isn’t suc-
cess. 7 ”

has ‘

and on DVD

iAnd yet, there are shows like
“Upright Citizen’s. Brigade.” This
show was before its time and didn’t
receive nearly as much credit as it
deserved. The show was cancelled
after three seasons, but wasn’t
released on DVD until about four
months ago- Meanwhile, fellow
Comedy Central program “Strangers
With Candy,” a program inferior to
the aforementioned UCB,4 was on
DVD for at least eight months before
that. ‘ « _

AUCB was able to get onto DVD
because of a lot of support ‘through
their following. Not to say that

“Strangers with Candy” didn’t have

support. from a fan base, but a lot more
people watched ,UCB.

But none have benefited more
from television—to-DVD moves than
“Family Guy.”

“Family Guy,’ the controversial
show about a lower—middle class Irish
family living in Quahog, R.I., was
cancelled two years ago. Forthe most
part, the controversial aspects of the
show outweighed its popularity. The
show was considered dead, and no
new episodes were scheduled to be
made. "'

9

This was until, of course, the sales ‘
of the first DVD Volume reached more _

than 1 million. _

Pretty soon, a “Family Guy”
movie was in the Works (it still is, but
it’ll be going straight to Video).

Seth MacFarlane, the creator of
the show, was rumored to be back in
bed with Fox on a brand new show
about a CIA agent with a liberal
daughter (this show may actually still
be in the works). A

Then, something really weird hap-
pened. . L 0 A

Fox not only ‘picked “Family
Guy” back up, but they promised a
new 35-episode season by the end of
2005. . _ ' —

While this may be the first — and
possibly only —— case of a show resur-
rected through the. television-_show—i

DVD phenomena, it’s certainly a rev—.

olution, compared ‘to the old one-
strike-and-you’re-out policy of pro-
gramming. ‘ » 0

In short, let’s just,‘ say if
“Gilligan’s Island” came out on DVD
30 years ago, there would’Ve been
more than three seasons.

“Planet of the Apes?” No, it’s the production of “Kaﬂ<a’s Chimp”

Kafka’sChimp
Starring: Richard Morris,
Michael Douglas Jones
Directed by: John Metcalf
Quantum Theatre

(412) 394-3353

sL‘n£‘r1/2

What makes us human? Is it the
small differences between our genes and
those of apes? Or is it the way we act and
conduct ourselves in civilized society? Are
we really all that different, and are we real-
ly all that civilized? Are we, the cultured
humans more or less free than the ape that
spends his days amidst the forest bed?
These are questions raised in Quantum
Theatre’s production ——- and the American
premiere —— of “Kaﬂ<a’s Chimp.”

The opera is based on a short story by
Franz Kafka, titled “A Report to the
Academy?’ in which a chimpanzee, cap-
tured along the Gold Coast of Africa, slow-
ly learns to take on human traits to gain
freedom from the cage in which he is
imprisoned. He learns to smoke and drink,
then to speak.

“Kaﬂ<a’s Chimp” opens with the
chimpanzee Red Peter (Richard Morris)
——- so named because a bullet grazed his
cheek during his capture, leaving a large
red scar — sitting in his cage suspended in
the middle of the stage. Wanting the free-

dom of humans, Peter breaks out and takes
his first awkward steps to becoming
human.

The play then jumps ahead several
years to after he has thrown off most of his
ape qualities, but some memories and ten-
dencies still haunt him and call him back to
his past It is one day before the Director

(Michael Douglas”Jo)n,es);'y {Red Peter’s .

teacher and keeper, must give a report to
the" intemational ‘group o“fi.scientists he

repprt.eoncems*the great strides_,Red Peter

has made towards becoming human under s 
his supervision and instruction. But just as ._ 
Red Peter has; gradually metamorphosed '

into athumlan, the Director has undergone
some changes in the other direction.
“Kaﬂ<a’s Chimp” makes full use of the

two-level stage, composed of intertwining‘ 2 I

scaffolding, allowing the orchestrato break
away from their normal placement and
roam about freely and serve as actorsinthe
play. Throughout the play, two chim-
panzees, played by {Attack Theatre’s

Michele de-la Rezaand Peter Kope, climb

the scaffolding and remind the audience of
what lurks beneath the human exterior of
Peter and, in fact, all of the actors and
everyone in the theater.

The play extends the plot beyond the ..
short story to add women to Peter’s life, in I
the form of his love interest Kaye (Laura V
Meloy), and Frieda, a member ofthe I

Academy who also has feelings for Peter.
The cast is rounded out by Joe Haughton,
who plays the role of The Assistant to the
Director, and of a chimp.

The music of “Kaﬂ<a’s Chimp,” com-
posed by John Metcalf, with libretto by
Mark Morris, varies from soft, melodic
pieces, sung beautifully by the performers,

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS «

 

Pantherstravel to South Bend

J IMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Since Notre Dame lost to the Pitt men’s basketball team

on Jan. 12 at the Petersen Events»Center, the Fighting Irish» I 

havebeen caught in _a downward spiral. _

In" the“ six’ gar""r‘res”"that followed the 74-71 loss to the
Panthers, the Irish dropped four of the six, including losses
to Kentucky, Boston College, Rutgers and Syracuse.

On Saturday, Pitt _(2 1-1 overall,‘ 7-1 Big East) and Notre
Dame (14-7, 3-5) meet again, but thisitime at the Joyce
Center in South Bend, Ind. ——‘ a place where Pitt has not
won since Jan. 6, 1998.

1 '‘‘It’s a pretty tough place to play,” guard Jaron Brown 1

said of the home of the Irish — a place where he has never
won in his four years at Pitt.‘ -
As for what makes Notre Dame such a tough placeto
play, Brown said it was the sea of green fans. 1 _ ‘
“And. that little leprechaun,” guard Carl Krauser said
with a big smile. ‘‘[He] throws you off with the little, green

, When these’ two teams met earlier this season, Pitt’ :
trailed for most of the game, until Krauser hit a three—point- _

buzzer.

be a comfortable lead, the Irish would climb back into the

Training is

When Punxsutawney Phil sees his
shadow in February, it signiﬁes one thing—
baseball is around the comer. As of today,
there are only seven days remaining until
pitchers and catchers report to spring train-

As baseball fans anxiously await the
start of spring training, many questions, as
usual, surface about unsigned and over-

the worst teams will be.

Fitzgeraldideclared
eligible for NFL Draft

KEVIN NAsH__ _
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt wide receiver and Heisman Trophy run-
ner—up Larry Fitzgerald was declared eligible for '

the2004,NFLDraft'Ihursday,accordingto*

ESPN.com.--    .. .

'Ihe-armouncement came on the same day
that a federal judge ruled that suspended Ohio
State‘  back Maurice Clarett could also
enter the draft. Under NFL rules, a player is eligi-
ble to enter the NFL only after three years have
passed since a player’s high school class has grad-
uated

Fitzgerald was declared eligible by the NFL
due to the fact that his last year of high school"
would have actually been at his_liigh school in
Minnesota in 2001. Except rriidway through his
senior year in 2001, Fitzgerald transferred to
Valley Forge (Pa) Military Academy in order to
boost his grades.

After one and a half semesters at Valley
Forge, Fitzgerald signed with, Pitt where he
played two seasons and set two NCAA records.
Those records were 18 consecutive games with a
touchdown reception and 34 receiving touch-
downs during his freshman and sophomore years.

Will no BCS Bowls and losing recruits kill Harris?

 

After the loss of two western
Pennsylvania top recruits to Penn State and
Miami ' on Wednesday, the question
remains: Who’s to blame for letting a star
rrmning back and quarterback slip through
the cracks? V '

Thishasbeenadiﬂicultyearfortlie
Pitt football program, starting the year at
No. 11, and ﬁnishing with an 8-5 record
and a loss in the not-so-hot Continental
Tire Bowl.

But no matter the sport, whether it’s
pro or college, a team’s failures fall square-
ly on the shoulders of its head coach —— in
this case, Walt Harris.

Harris has had a rough couple of
months. He saw his team fail to meet very
high expectations while watching his con-
ference completely fall apart. He saw his

ﬁrst much-touted recruit, Rod Rutherford,
graduate without a conference title or BCS
Bowl game.iAnd now he just lost out in
what is believed to be his best attribute,
recruiting.

It’s a tough process to build a college
football program It takes time, commit-
ment and, eventually, winning. When
Harris took the job as Pitt football head
coachin 1997, hetookoveraprogramthat
had just lost the previous season to Ohio
State, 724), West Virginia. 34.0, and
Miami, 45-0. To say the least, just putting
out a competitive team in .1997 would have
been enough. '

But Harris completely mined around
Pitt’s program. VV1th no expectations,
Hanis could slowly build a team around
his style of play. And as the seasons rolled
on and Pitt got better and better, expecta-
tions started to creep up on Harris.

‘At the beginning of 2003, Pitt was
expected to compete with Miami for a Big
East Conference Title. That never hap-
pened It seems like Harris had an easy
time when no one cared or expected Pitt
football to do well, but once the national
spotlight began to shine, Harris became
overwhelmed.

A rather quiet, soft-spoken person,
Harris has become more outgoing lately,
answering critics who have said that
maybe it’s time for him to leave Pitt. But on
Wednesday, instead of answering ques-
tions about whom he got on signing day, he
defended his job and his loss of top-notch
recruits.

One oftherecruitsPitthadaverbal
commitment from and‘ lost was Penn Hills
quarterback Anthony Moielli. In a press
conference Wednesday morning, Morelli
stated his reason for going to Penn State:
He believes Joe Patemo, Penn State’s head
coach, will be with his team longer then
Harris will be with his.

Questions arose during the 2003 sea-
son as to Harris’ play calling. Heisman
Trophy runner-up Larry Fitzgerald didn’t
see the ball more than a combined 10 times
in Pitt’s ﬁnal two games of the season. Pitt
lost big games to West Virginia and Miami
where a win would have clinched a New
Year’s Day Bowl. '

Many thought Harris would be ﬁred
after the Tire Bowl debacle against
Virginia. Others believed that Pitt would

Colts and Buccaneers to meet in Super Bowl XXXIX

SPQ 

    
 

pgvrew

So, ﬁnally, the Super Bowl is over and
we can all move on to making outra-
geous predictions about next season.

Sure, the Pro Bowl has yet to occur, no
schedules have been set and the draft is a
thing of the distant future, but it’s truly never
too early to predict where teams will ﬁnish

next year.

It’s been pretty well documented that,
in the last couple of years, teams that made
the big game haven’t had success the next
year. Both the Patriots and Rams failed to
make the playoffs after winning their con-
ferences two years ago. And this season,
both of last year’s Super Bowl teams — the
Buccaneers and the Raiders — failed even
to have winning records. So recent history
deﬁnitely isn’t on either teain’s side.

In football, it’s all too common for
teams to trade places in the standings. Only
Tennessee, Indianapolis, Philadelphia and
Green Bay made the playoffs this year and
last year. The Jets, Giants, Browns, Raiders
and Falcons all ﬁnished last or tied for last in

their divisions this year after making the
playoﬁs last year. So it’s quite clear that win-
ning two years in a row is a very diﬂicult
thing.

Since an appearance in the Super Bowl
always seems to lull teams to sleep the next
year, especially the ﬁrst—timers, the outlook
isn’t too bright for the Panthers. The
Patriots, on the other hand, have already
gone through a post—Super Bowl sputter and
are unlikely to do it again. _

A second strike against Carolina is its
division, which probably has the toughest
competition from top to bottom. The
Falcons were 3-1 with Michael Vick starting
games this season, and if he can stay
healthy, chances are tl1ey’ll easily make the

Want: to live in a great
apatent next year?

playoﬂs.

Tampa Bay has something to prove
next season after the embarrassing 7-9
record it posted after winning the Super
Bowl. Most likely, it will come out of the
gates smoking and win the division, or at
least a wild-card spot.

And you can never quite count out the
Saints. If New Orleans ever lives up to its
potential, it will be a force to" be reckoned
with. But if history has anything to do with
it, the Saints will ﬁnish right around 0.500
and probably deal one or two crucial blows
to contending playoff teams, one of them
most likely being Carolina.

Dallas is sure to get better in the East, but

unless they change quarterbacks, the
Cowboys won’t be a major contender.
(Although I, as well as every professional
analyst, saidthe same thing about Carolina
and Jake Delhomme earlier this season.)
Minnesota will most likely improve as well,
thus supplanting the aging Packers atop the
North.

The Eagles should contend once again,
as they seem to every year, despite always
appearing to get worse, and slip into the
playoffs to join the Cowboys, Vikings,
Falcons, Bucs and Rams.

The AFC should see ﬁve of the six
teams ﬁom this year’s playoffs returning.
The Patriots will win the East again, but
only by edging out the J-E-T-S, Jets; Jets;
Jets! With the retum of a healthy Chad
Pennington, New York will provide some
serious problems for New England, but Bill
Belichick will ﬁnd a way for his team to ﬁn-
ish ahead of them, and the Dolphins, who
will undoubtedly collapse at the end of the
season for the’ 80th consecutive year.

Both the Colts and Titans will make the
playoffs in a hard—fought AFC South battle
for the third straight year, and as long as they
stay out of a quarterback controversy, the
Ravens should stave off a 1nuch—improved
Steelers team. ,

In the west, Denver will take the crown
as long as its key players — Jake Plummer
and Clinton Portis — stay healﬂiy. Kansas
City_will think about challenging, but ulti-
mately realize that a Pop Warner defense is
not going to get it done and then fade off
into the sunset. The second wild card spot
should be up for grabs between the Chiefs,
Steelers and Jets, although I would put my
money on New York

The conference title games should,
repeat the low—scoring battles of the games
this year, with Indianapolis beating the sur-
prise Ravens on a game—winning ﬁeld goal
by a liquored-up, idiot kicker, and the Bucs

Several ex-Pirates have yet to find a home for 2004

Stuck, page 11 P

To the surprise of many, aging pitcher
Greg Maddux is still a free agent. K

Maddux, 38, had a subpar year by his
standards with a 3.96 ERAand 16-11 record
last season. Many analystsfelt that with age,
he was losing his groove, which produced
four Cy Young Awards and ‘12 consecutive
Gold Gloves in his 18-year career.

Maddux was approached by the

' Dodgers on Tuesday and last month by the

Cubs, but has yet to make any decision.

The loss of Maddux, a consistent per-»
former in October, will potentially just add to
the Atlanta Braves’ postseason woes of los-
ing three of the past four National League
division series. ‘ i A

On ﬂie other side of the battery, catcher
Ivan “Pudge” Rodriguez is bringing some
excitement to the baseball world in Detroit.
The Tigers signed Pudge to. a four-year, $40
million contract, with an option for a ﬁfth
season. ’ _ , A i

The Tigers, who lost anA.L. record 119
games last season, hope that Pudge will have

lose too many recruits if Harris left.

Well, Harris stayed. He is still the same
coach who made some unpopular play calls,
and on top, of that, he didn’t get ﬂre recruits.
He lost in his own game to two rivals, Penn
State and  Recruiting got Harris his
praise in Pittsburgh, and now it might be his
demise. -

Harris has now taken Pitt to four _

straight bowl games, but none of those four I
are well—known games, and none fall in the
month of January. t

It takes a let to build a football program,
but it takes even moreto put a good program
over the top. Right now,_ the job of . rebuild-
ing Pitt’s football program is only half done.
No longer are the losses 72-0, but there still
are no Conference Championships or New V
Year’s Day bowl games. ’

1 Should  be the coach of Pitt next
year? Weﬂ, if you live in the past, then yes,
he should. But if you live in the present and
look forward to the future, then maybe Pitt.
should reconsider who it wants to coach its
football team.

at Nebraska, “We will not accept mediocrity
at this institution. ”

Florida Marlins, with whom he spent just
one year.

Detroit also picked up veteran inﬁelder
Fernando Vlna and outﬁelder Rondell White

‘ irl hopes of losing no more than 100 games

in the 2004 season.

Soisitanysurprise‘toPiratesfansthat
many of Pittsburgh’s former players are
enjoying high-priced contracts on quality
ball clubs over the off-season? _

f The Yankees picked up ‘outﬁelder
Kenny Lofton from the Cubs in the off-sea-
son to add to their ex—Bucco line-up of
Enrique Wilson and J on Lieber. A

Pokey Reese and Adam, Hyzdu were
picked up by the Red Sox, While St. Louis
claimed pitchers Mike Lincoln, Julian
Tavarez and outﬁelder Reggie Sanders. ‘.

Although many former Pirates were
traded, there are still quite a few old-timers
left unclaimed, including Orlando Merced,
Al Martin, Ron Vlllone, Jay Bell and Dan
Plesac.

In other Pirates news this week, relief
pitcher Jason Boyd has been ordered to seek
counseling for anger management Boyd
was claimed off waivers from Cleveland.
Being a Pirate isn’t that bad, is it?

But perhaps the‘ biggest news in the
baseball oif-season comes from Houston.
The Astros picked up two former Yankees

. starters, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens, to

boost their pitching staﬁ”.  .

Clemens, who retired after just last sea-
son, madehisretumtobaseballjustmonths

while moving into 12th place on the all-time

“With the acquisition of veterans Petiitte

and Clemens, the Astros look to be tops in V

the NL. Central, battling with the talented
pitching staff of Chicago.

So as an early gut instinct, I’d like to see

game. Notre Da1ne’s Chris Thomas and
Chris Quinn -were the main reasons the
Irish didn’t go away. Both guards made
several tough shots, especially in the sec-
ond half. »

Thomas dropped 29 points on the
Panthers, while hitting seven-of-13 tl1ree-

point attempts. Quinn ﬁnished with x16‘

points, with 12 of his points coming off of
long—range three-pointers. ‘

‘They shoot from 24, 25 feet,” head
coach Jamie Dixon said. “That’s their
strength.”

He went on to say that it is just some-
thing the team will have to adjust to in
order to defend. He said they wouldn’t
change anything in order to stop Thomas.

“Itwas a good player making good
shots,” Dixon said of 'Ihomas’s perfor-
mance against Pitt on Jan. 12

“We played them tough last time,”
Brown said. “They just made good
shots.”

Pitt had no problem scoring against
Notre Dame last time. The Panthers ﬁn-
ished the game with all ﬁve starters in
double-digit scoring, led by Brown, who
ﬁnished with 19 points.

The only question mark for this game
is the status of Carl Krauser’s ﬁnger. He
dislocated the ring ﬁnger on his left hand
when deﬂecting an inbound pass during
the St. J ohn’s game Wednesday night.

“'There’s a little swelling,” Dixon
said.

He had'a light, no-contact practice
with the team on Thursday, and it was
wrapped during their afternoon press con-
ference. Dixon’ says Krauser will be a
game-time decision, but Krauser is not
worried about it too much.

. “It pretty much doesn’t [affect me],
since it’s on the left hand,” Krauser said,
pointing out the fact that he has a right-
handed shot. .

This game is the start of a little road
trip for the Panthers. After Notre ‘Dame,
they have to travel to Seton‘ Hall on
Monday. Pitt lost to Pirates last year, and
both Brown and Krauser noted that they
want to walk out of Seton Hall with a win.

When asked if this upcoming stretch
of games were the most crucial part of the
season, Dixon stuck with his “one game
at a time” mentality and said, “The next
game is always the most crucial part.”

The Panthers undertake this next cru-
cial step at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
