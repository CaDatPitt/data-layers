University stays mum
about Internet plagiarism

Pitt English Department
Chair David Bartholomae said
that students, buying term
papers off the Internet is not a
problem at Pitt — as far as he
knows. ~

However, two lab assis-
tants at the Cathedral of
Learning computer lab avoided
the question when asked if they
knew of any Pitt students pur-
chasing term papers off the
Internet.

One turned and walked
away when confronted with the
inquiry and the other looked at
his computer screen and said
"no comment."

When asked why he would
not talk about the situation, he

Term papers for sale on the
Internet became national news

last month when Boston
University charged several
Internet companies in federal
court with wire fraud, mail
fraud, racketeering and violat— -
ing a Massachusetts law that
bans the sale of term papers.
BU hired an undercover
investigator to pose as a des-

companies ended up selling
papers to the investigator.

Lab assistants at Hillman

supervisor, Kevin Killen, for-
bids them to talk to the media.
They also said they are to refer
all inquiries to Pitt Spokesman,

money.

An investigation into
alleged embezzlement of $7,000 in
allocations’ funds is still being con-
ducted, but no one’s talking
because there are “potentially legal
issues.”

Gerald Klayman, who was chair
of the Allocations Committee until
his resignation on Oct. 29, was
accused of funnelling $7,000 in

the The two-week-old investigation

is being conducted the departments
of Internal Audit and Public Safety.
“It"ll wind itself down fairly
soon,” said John Elliot, director of
Internal Audit. “Probably in a few
weeks we’ll be able to say what’s
happened. We can’t say anything
before then because there are
potentially legal issues.”

Joe Cavalla, Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs, said the inves- ‘
tigation ‘is “out of his hands.” He
did say, however, that “nothing has
been found.”

“I don’t exactly know what’s
been done,” said Cavalla. “He’s
innocent until proven guilty,
though.”

Detective Kathleen Schreiber
from Public Safety, who is helping
conduct the investigation, could not
be reached for comment.

There's no place like
A home for the holidays.
. This appeared to
be the feeling of several
Pitt students as they aban-
doned campus via planes,
trains and automobiles
over the past few days.
Many students had to
stay on campus until classes
concluded, but some students,
, like freshman Kara Deardorff, were
G"“Ph" by Beck)’ able to escape the daily grind early.

"I'm going home to Gettysburg,” she
said. “It's a long drive, and I want to make
Thanksgiving, my favorite holiday, last as
longas I can."

Rob Garvey, a junior, can't get home
until Thanksgiving evening, but he will
still enjoy his holiday time away from
campus. .

"I can't wait to go home. My whole
family will be there, and we always have
so much great food,” he said. “After din-
ner, we'll sit around and watch football for
the rest of the night.”

Freshman Justin Blott felt the best
part of his holiday will be visiting the
canine members of his family.

Students can’t wait to go home to their  clogs?

"I'm leaving_ Tuesday around [5:00
p.m.] and I have about a five hour drive
home. It's a long trip to make but it's
worth it because I'll get_to see my dogs
whom I haven't seen since I left for
school.”

‘ Erin Brett, a freshman, also had a
great deal of Thanksgiving spirit.

"I'm going home Tuesday morning,
and I'll get to see my sister who I haven't
seen in a long time,” said Brett. “I'm not
really into the big dinner; I just enjoy the
spirit of the holiday."

Alison Shufran, a sophomore, looked
forward to getting out of Oakland, but

Bill Bri-cker, the owner of area
Giant Eagle stores, claims he is see-
ing more Pitt students in his Centre
Avenue and.Squirrel Hill stores
since the Forbes Avenue store’s
closing.

Students, however, say they are
not making the trip to shop at Giant
Eagle supermarkets.

Amanda Smith, a junior South
Oakland student, said she finds
alternatives to going to Giant Eagle
because she has a car.

“I’m one of the fortunate ones
that has a car, so I can choose to
shop somewhere that has better
prices and a wider selection,” she
said.

Smith’s roommate, Steph Mann,
a junior, was glad that she could
shop elsewhere with the help of
Smith’s car.

“It would be nice to have the
Forbes Avenue Giant Eagle for
quick things, but I don’t miss shop-
ping there,” Mann said. “I -go to
Food4Less now and I like it better.”

Junior Liz Motson did not mind
finding alternatives to Giant Eagle
because she was unhappy with the
service she received at the old

‘ Forbes Avenue location.

“Before I had a car I had to shop
there, and I didn’t like it. It was
often really dirty. Now that I have a
choice, I go elsewhere.”

' Despite the feelings of several
automobile owners, Jamie
DeWeese, a freshman, still shops at
Giant Eagle.

 
Students find alternatives to   I

old Forbes Ave.

Giant Eagle

“I go to the Squirrel Hill loca-
tion and I usually end up. taking a
lot of my friends along.”

Students who do not own cars
find shopping more difficult and
often choose alternatives closer to
campus. "

Jolena Sterner, a freshman, said
she had made the effort to travel to
the North Oakland store by bus, but
she found the trip to be inconve-
nient.

“I took the bus up to the Giant

‘Eagle before, but carrying all of

those bags on the bus was not cool,
and now that it’s getting colder, I
don’t go at all,” she said.
“Sometimes if one of my friends
gives me a ride I’ll shop at the
Giant Eagle, but my mom sends me
a lot of food too.”

Kim Mays, a sophomore, does
most of her shopping on campus
with her extra Dining Dollars or
blocks.

“I basically shop at Eddie’s or
7-Eleven, and when I have money, I
go to the Food Gallery in
Shadyside. I don’t go to Giant Eagle
— the old Forbes Avenue location
turned me off to it.”

Kevin Carey, a sophomore liv-
ing in South Oakland, said he does-
n’t worry about which chain is most
convenient, instead he goes to the
store with the best prices.

“I get on the bus and go to the
Giant Eagle regularly. The North
Oakland shuttle drops me off right
there. I find Giant Eagle pretty
accessible, but I go wherever I can
save the most money,” he said.

PAPERS 

Ken Service.

A member of the Computing and
Information Services support staff said
the same thing — all inquiries about
computer labs and computing are to be
directed to Service.

Service, however, was unavailable
for comment.

Gary Calpas, an instructor in the
Pitt English Department, said he has
not seen any papers he believes were
purchased from the Internet.

He added that he doesn't know
much about how some students get

FROM PAGE 1

bogus papers. He did say that he sus-
pects the Internet might make it a lot
easier.

Bartholomae said he doesn't see
plagiarism as a problem at Pitt.

"We do a good job teaching
English here and we shape the curricu-
lum so that it is too specific to be pla-
giarized," he said.

Bartholomae has been at Pitt for
25 years and said he knows of no
instances of students buying papers.

According to Bartholomae, if a
professor discovered that a student pur-
chased a paper from the Internet, the
situation would be immediately report-
ed to him.

The Slackers will perform their breed owold-school sko at L th

Co be Slclékers

  

IS week.

The Slackers aren't buying into the
easy ska way to get mighty rich

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

As ska becomes more popular, an
increasing number of bands are shaping
their new material to resemble those who
are becoming famous and making money
—— namely, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

The Slackers, however, are not one of
these bands.

They have kept true to their sound and
to what they are all about. 6

The Slackers new album Redlight is a
testament to that- They left Moon Ska
Records, the label who has had a monopoly
of the best ska bands around, for Hellcat
Records, an Epitaph (Bad Religion,
NOFX, Rancid, Bouncing Souls) sub-
sidiary.

The Slackers ﬁrst album on Moon
Records, Better. Late Than Never, was a
brilliant display of traditional Jamaican ska
and rocksteady."

Redlight has taken that same groove to
the next level, showing olf their American
jazz/blues/R&B inﬂuences a little more, all
the while keeping true to the Jamaican
roots of the music.

The first track on Redlight is “Cooking
for Tommy,” a tribute to Tommy McCook,
the tenor saxophonist of the ska band the
Skatallites. The instrumental starts oil” with
a drum beat that builds up for about ﬁve
seconds before breaking into a tight Latin-
type melody with a straight ska beat. The
guest soloist on guitar plays a brilliant jazz
solo, and each of the horns falls in line
behind with skillfully improvised solos.
The sharp unison of the melody kicks back
in after the solo performances, and keeps
the feet moving throughout the rest of the
song.

"Married Girl" is one of those
ska/R&B numbers that rocks gently with a
1950s feel. The organ intro turns around
and doubles the rhythm guitar and back-

ground homs support as lead singer, Marq ’

Lyn, sings "Married girl don't you
wanna/smoke a little marijuana."

"I Still Love You" is as classic a song
as a ska song can get, and that's a lot. The
entire horn section mirrors the piano and
guitar, as the bass struts along behind the
exaggerated rhythm. This song sounds like
it's straight out of Jamaica in 1964. The
cheerful repetitive horn melody rounds out
the song after the soloists ﬁnish up. The
solos in this song are simpliﬁed a bit, giv-
ing it a peppy lift.

The Slackers kick the rocksteady thing

again on "You Must Be Good" with anoth— —

er traditional gem. The guitar plays a muted
melody along with the bass, giving the
song a strong reggae feel. The saxophonist
plays the swaying melody while the trum-
pet player throws in a slur occasionally for
good measure. Lyn, in the spirit of Bob
Marley sings "So you must be good/so you
can sleep at night." The Slackers pull off the
almost biblical lyrics of the old Jamaican
style very well. They have the right amount
of melody and a good repetitive social mes-
sage.

The Slackers deal out just the right pro-
portion of social issues and songs about
chicks on Redlight. They cover just about
every topic from violent New York cops to
bikini-clad girls on the beach. They also
proportion the speedier ska songs and the
slower rocksteady numbers as well.

Everybody who bitches when their
favorite band "sells out" should be a
Slackers fan, because they will not trade
their musical integrity for money. If the
Slackers ever appear on MTV, it will be
because MTV changed for the Slackers,
and not the other way around.

The Slackers roll into town with the
New York Mob Town Tour on Nov. 26.
They will play at Club Laga at 7:30 p.m.
with Skinnerbox and the Stubbome All-
Stars.

Pitt debaters talk themselves into finals at Wake Forest tourney

James Maude
Staff Wrlter

When it came time to face the pow-
erhouse, two Pitt freshmen debaters split
contests with their counterparts from
Northwestem University in the nation’s
2nd largest college debate competition.

Last week, the Pitt team of Phil
Elwood and Andrew Stangl, of the
William Pitt Debating Union, » argued
through to the ﬁnal round of the Wake
Forest University Dixie Classic debate
tournament in Winston—Sa1em, North
Carolina.

The freshman duo beat a team from
Northwestern in the semi-ﬁnal, but lost
to another Northwestern team in the ﬁnal

match.

They won four of their eight pre-
liminary rounds, disputing this semes-
ter's topic — "Resolved: the U.S. should
substantially increase its security assis-
tance to Southeast Asian nations" —— and
found themselves in the elimination
rounds in the "freshman breakout" cate-
gory. .

On the way to the elimination
rounds, Elwood and Stangl out-argued
two teams from Wayne State University,
and had "a good win over a very strong
Kansas team," according to Stangl.

Ron Von Burg, assistant coach for
the VWPDU, said the win over
Northwestern was an impressive feat, as
Northwestern has dominated the debate

tournaments over the past decade.
"Northwestem has _a complete,

tough squad from top to bottom," said

Von Burg. "It was very exciting having

them reach the ﬁnals, and doing so well I

in a very tough ﬁeld. This is a big win for
the youngsters." V

Gordon Mitchell, director of debate
with the WPDU and a Northwestem
alumnus, agreed with Von Burg on
Elwood and Stangl's marked accom-
plishment in a competition that attracted
138 college teams from all around the
United States. .

"For ﬁrst—year debaters, one of the
first things they need to achieve is con-
sistency," Mitchell said. "This is an out-
standing indicator that they are well on

their way to achieving that. They still
need to be established as credible
debaters in the Varsity circuit, and this
shows that they're well on their way to
doing tha ." .

Three other Pitt teams competed in
the tournament, though none reached
elimination rounds. The team of Lisa
Corrigan and Almas Sayeed won three of
its preliminary rounds, while the Mark
DeNardis-Brendan Delaney and Eric
English-Chris Burdick teams both won
two.

Von Burg said he felt all four teams
performed well in an very competitive
ﬁeld.

Mitchell pointed out that Elwood
and Stangl tended to win more rounds
when arguing the negative side of the
topic, and that, amazingly, their success
came in a tournament where judges
voted 65 percent in favor of teams argu-
ing the affirmative side.

Both Stangl and Elwood saw their
performance as a good precursor to the
National Novice Debating
Championship next semester.

" [This result] allows us to go into the
next semester with conﬁdence," said
Stangl.

"This assures that -we're competitive
enough," said Elwood.

Von Burg expressed conﬁdence in
the performance of the WPDU's time
ahead.

"This bodes very well for the future
of this team," said Von Burg.

"It prepares them by giving them a
jolt of confidence," added Mitchell.
"Their elimination win over
Northwestern proves that they have the
ability to win at a national level. It shows
that the future looks good for the
University of Pittsburgh's [debating
team ."

said her holiday would be bittersweet.

"I'll be happy to see my family and
eat some real food, but this is a real
working holiday for me,” she said. “I
have to use the time to prepare for
exams and get some work done that is
due when I come back."

Other students, like freshman
Melissa Mienzer planned on forgetting
school during their break.

"I'm going to enjoy my family over
the holiday and totally relax. I don't
plan to _do any work over the holiday,”
Mienzer explained. “I'll do it all
Sunday night when I get back."

No matter what people's favorite
aspects of the holiday were, everyone,
including sophomore Christen Lowery.
seemed to be happy for the break
before exam time.

"Thanksgiving comes at a great
time. It's just the break I need to get
through my upcoming finals.”

Service did explain that the
University's concerns with the web
page stemmed from the 500,000 visi-
tors it received in its first 20 days of
existence.

"There was a speed degradation as
a result of the web page," Service said,
"and students were receiving lower
quality service than they're entitled to."

Vranesevich said he wonders why
Lee Bannister, the CIS official who
ﬁled the complaint against him, didn't
ask him to reduce the number of visi-
tors AntiOnline receives.

"We can limit the number of hits
the page gets and I would've been more
than happy to do that," said

Vranesevich. "I still don't understand '
why they didn't call. It would've taken
ten minutes to change the page and all
of this could have been avoided." ‘

cial hearing will come as soon as possi-
ble, perhaps in early January.

teen-age crowd a few years ago, co-
owner Jennifer Cousin said she is "try-
ing to bring Pittsburgh up to the 90s."

The store, which is located on
Oakland Avenue across from Peter's
Pub, offers a variety of juice blends and
smoothies.

"It's a grab-and-go meal in a cup,"
said Cousin with her partner, Linda
Cost.

The brightly-colored menu lists
over 25 different juices. The juice
drinks are all named after sports terms,
such as Double Axle, Hat Trick,
Touchdown, and Freestyle — which is a
blend of mango juice, mangos, peaches,
strawberries, and pineapples.

The frozen yogurt and sherbet used
in thedrinks are selected to keep calorie
counts low and the ingredients are all-

' natural. Also, all of the drinks are fat-
free, with the exception of the "Bench
Press," which has a mere three grams of
fat. -

The founders of the Juice Stop were
athletes themselves, and they created
the store with other athletes in mind,
recognizing the need for nutrient
replacement in their meals.

The Juice Stop hopes to target all
Pitt students,including those who aren't
athletes. ,

"The Juice Stop is for everybody, so
don't be afraid to come in," she said.

With each 24—ounce drink, cus-
tomers receive two "extra points." Extra

points are mineral” shots. All minerals’

are listed on the wall of the shop, along
with explanations of their benefits.
Customers can choose from 13 different
Ininerals, including bee pollen, ginseng
and spirulina.

The shop also offers the Colloidal ’

Minerals drink, which contains 74 min-
erals extracted from prehistoric shale.
The Juice Stop also carries low—fat
snacks such as mufﬁns and nutritional
food bars.

"We want to bring the gym to you," 0

said Cousin. "We're all health promot-
ers here."

Football gods, please

let uswin at WVU
Alright. Here it goes again 

Dear Most Honored Football Gods,

The Pitt News pleaded with you a couple
months ago for a football victory overPenn State,
and we offered you just about everything short of
our players’ souls to get it.

You let us down, guys. Why? Did you want
our players’ souls that bad? Take them! They’re
yours! '

Actually, we know why you didn’t grant us
that victory. It would have served no purpose but
to stroke our vanities.

Not that our vanities couldn’t have used a little
stroking, but we understand that it was not the
most virtuous of prayers.

So, consider this one:

Please, please, pretty please with pierogies on
top n’at, let the Panthers beat West Virginia this
week. i
' A win over West Virginia almost guarantees
Pitt a spot in a bowl game._ And the Pitt Panthers
want to go to a bowl game.

But they’re not the only ones who want it.
There are lots of little boys with colds lying in beds
who are too sick to go out and play, and who would
love nothing else better than to watch their home-
town college football team play in a big game.

Okay, so those little boys are really a few
staffers at The Pitt News. So they’re not really sick,
just too out of shape to play. ‘Maybe they’re not
even all from Pittsburgh. So what?

It’s still a noble cause, isn’t it?

Now we know the West Virginia team is prob-
ably asking you for a victory, too. They’re proba-
bly even offering up sacriﬁces and performing
some kinds of sacred rituals with farm animals for
your amusement. (At least, we hope they’re sacred
rituals.) Please, don’t listen to them.

The Panthers have worked damn hard all sea-
son, but not to just get here and lose. It was to get
to a bowl game. We’d like to get there by going
through West Virginia.

For last year’s opener, WVU came here to play
under the lights of Pitt Stadium. We thought they’d
be distracted by electricity. But we were wrong.

The slammed us 34-0 and embarrassed us on
national television.

We want revenge.

Skip the turkey and serve up some snow seal

Thanksgiving dinner is perhaps
the only time most of us can, individu-
ally, eat more than the average family
of four does in any given week Or
maybe it’s the only time we can spend
that “quality” time with family mem-
bers we didn’t even know existed until
the third Wednesday in November of
that particular year. That’s not to say
people like your great Uncle Zeke are
unwelcome — after all, there’s
undoubtedly something to be learned
fromamanwhohasmadehisunique
ability to simultaneously smoke ciga-
rettes out of no less than 12 different
oriﬁces on his body into a $54,000-a-
year job.

But there are those out there who
are not brought together by this holi-
day. In fact, they are horribly persecut-
ed, subjugated and served with a side
of mashed potatoes and gravy.

That’s right folks: I’m talkin’
turkeys here.

"Iurkey day” as it is so inhumane-
ly dubbed, is an all-out agenda of poul-
try genocidé that has rooted itselfin our
culture as a “tradition.” We get to give
thanks, but what do all the little gob-
blers in the world have to give thanks
for? That they weren’t served with a
side of broccoli?!? That they didn’t end
up as a dish served with red wine?

You people should be ashamed of
yourselves. I hope you can enjoy your
meal while hearing the souls of rnil-
lions of turkey’s screaming from an
earthbound purgatory as you delicately
spread cranberry sauce all over what
usedtobetheirpn'marymodeoftrans—
portation.

As an alternative, I’d like to offer
some of my secret recipes from a stack
of nrmpled note-cards that I found hid-
den in the recesses of that space
between my refrigerator and the wall
of my apartment, so that you can live

0 U.S.D.A. Prime Sirloin Steak
That’s right: nothing beats a nice,

_thick juicy, bloody rare steak to satisfy

that deep down hunger you’re feeling.
Let’s face it: turkeys are cute —-— they
make exotic photographic subjects and
interesting psychological comparisons
to the last person you were dating.
Cows, on the other hand, make base-
ball gloves, jackets and 78 percent of
the menu at the average fast food
restaurant.

Theyare-—bytheirverynature
— food. From a natural selection per-
spective, it’s not as though their natural
camouﬂage works anywhere other
than in kitschy mall shops and the
Gateway computer factory warehouse.
The only place a cow’s unique hide
effectively conceals them is among
other cows. Hey the way I see it, that’s
God’s way of saying to the animals of
the world, “Somebody here is going to
almost exclusively form their own
food group.”

Cooking time: Until it looks done.
Serves: Well, technically the entire
world could eat from it if everyone got

‘ just oneatonr

0 Baby Snow Seal — This rare
delicacy is indeed hard to come by but
is wonderfully tender when poachers
don’t use clubs to harvest them. If your
baby seal meat was caught using the
"This-isn’t-the-end-of-a-shotgrm-it’s-
your-mother’s-breast” luring method,
it can be extremely succulent and satis-
fyins

THE PITT NEWS

Cooking time: Best served raw.
Serves: One seal provides a 1/18 ounce
steak so four or ﬁve seals should satis-
fy one 100-pound person

0 Western Atlantic Dolphin —
Also lmown as mahi-rnahi (which is
Hawaiian for “Shut the hell up. This is
all your lazy father caught today, so eat
it”), this dolphin makes a wonderful
addition to any holiday feast. In the
case of dolphins, you’ll just have to
overlook the cuteness factor simply
becauseofthefactthattheycanscore
higher on the SATs than a majority of
American highschoolers. By dining on
dolphin, you are not only helping to
ensure the elimination of a potential
intelligence threat to our species, but
you are helping to stop the senseless
capture and display of these beasts at
such gulag—type water parks as “Sea
World” and “Marineland.” (Funa,
unfortunately enough, are often caught
in the nets of dolphin ﬁshers —— a
tragedy that almost makes eating this
meal a moral crime, but what the heck.)

Cooking time: The time it takes to
view your average “Flipper” episode.
Serves: No one but itself, another rea-
son to eat them

0 Grass —- Yep, run-of—the—mill
lawn grass. This dish is a vegetarian
option of the season. Available every-
where and best served within two
hours of cutting.

a Cooking time: Don’t even bother.
Serves: Cows and rabbits.

So now you can set your table and
smile, because it’s time to eat! And you
can do so knowing that some turkey
out there would thank you for it if he
actually could grasp the concept of
what you had done.

U.S. shouldn't reward China for its inhumanities

Michael Berquist

columnlst

China’s President Jiang
Zernin recently came to the
United States to conduct an offi-
cial state visit during which he
made a remark that angered me.
When asked about China’s 1959
occupation of Tibet, President
Jiang dared to compare it to
President Lincoln’s decision to
emancipate the slaves during the
Civil War, claiming it was China’s
“democratic reform that emanci-
pated some one million serfs and
slaves” and brought about “great
social change and advance.”

When asked about China’s
crackdown on student and reli-
gious groups, Jiang replied that
the dissidents would not be freed,
explaining: “Their cases were
handled not because of the politi-
cal views or religious beliefs they
have, but rather because they had
violated the criminal laws of
So these guys must have
done pretty nasty things like kill
people, right? .

Wrong. The “criminal laws”
they broke were laws against reli-
gious freedom and protest.
Among those criminals in China’s
prison system are Father Guo Bo
Le Shanghai, who was sentenced
to two years of “re-education” in
January for the “crime” of saying
mass. In Jiangxi Province, 80
Catholics were beaten by police
and jailed last November. Chinese
Christian leaders have claimed
that40pereentoftheinrnatesata
massive labor camp in Henan are
Christians imprisoned by the gov-
ernrnent for their religious beliefs.
In occupied Tibet and elsewhere,
dissidents and students are beaten
and imprisoned for challenging
the Chinese govemment’s speech
policies.

President Jiang has defended
China’s human rights policy, say-
ing: “I hope the U.S. people will
understand that U.S. democracy
and freedom are not absolute con-
cepts. People of different coun-
tries should be allowed to have
their own perceptions and own
understandings of the concept of
democracy, based on their own

national situations.”

While one could plausibly
make a compelling argument that
the American—style of democracy
isn’t for everyone, China’s brutal
and systematic torture and
oppression of political and reli-
gious groups goes well beyond
the bounds of the acceptable. Its
speech policies are Orwellian and
defy justiﬁcation. To get an idea
of how total China’s control of its
citizens’ actions are, consider this:
The Chinese police ordered jour-
nalists attending one of President
Jiang’s pre-visit press conferences
to arrange and park their cars so
that they would look more orderly
. After meeting with President
Jiang to discuss China’s human
rights policies, Congressman
Chris Smith remarked with dis-
gust: “It reminds meof the old
days of the Soviet Union.”

Several people have argued
that the United States ought not
link our trade policies towards
China with human rights out of
fear that our economy might suf-
fer. There are two ﬂaws with this

argument.

The ﬁrst is that our trade with
China is negligible at best. We
buyagreatdealfromChina,and
they buy virtually nothing of
value from us. The U.S/Chinese
trade deﬁcit jumped from $1.6
billion in 1986 to $33.9 billion in
1995. Aside from manufactured
aircraft, the United States exports
few job producing exports to
China. Our ﬁfth-leading export to
China is scrap metal, hardly a
growth industry. The jobs gained
from our trade with China are
low-wage, and other than provid-
ing a welfare program for lobby-
ists paid to inﬂuence members of
Congress, our trade beneﬁts few
Americans. ‘

Second, it is worth asking
what price we pay when we
refuse to challenge China to
improve it’s human rights record.
I cannot think of a compelling
argument to explain why a coun-
try that values peace and democ-
racy can possibly support a fonn
of government that relies upon
violence to maintain power.
While some of China’s supporters
have argued that American for-

eign policy ought to be guided on
what is in our best interest, it is
impossible to defend an arraign-
ment that not only fails to beneﬁt
the American public, but also
makes us look like hypocrites.
There is little reason to believe
that China will reverse its course
on human rights. By persisting
with the status quo, we are mak-
ing a terrible mistake. ’ ‘

Robert F. Kennedy once said:
“Each time a man stands up for an
ideal, or acts to improve the lot of
others, or strikes out against injus-
tice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of
hope, and crossing each other
from a million centers of energy
and daring those ripples build a
current which can sweep down
the mightiest walls of oppression
and resistance.”
. We must begin to toughen
our policy towards China‘ and
encourage them to improve their
human rights record.

Michael Berquist thinks that the
United States shouldn’t shy away

from challenging Chinais human
rights record any longer.

TV media coverage of crimes seems a bit slanted

Commit a felony. Come on, go ahead.
Let’s see what happens. Well, okay, the
ﬁnal result will most likely be that you go
to jail for a rather long time and it’s possi-
ble that I would have to join you there
(What’s it called when you incite felonious
activity?), so let’s forget about you actually
committing a crime.

If you do happen to commit some sort
of major felony, though, let me know,
because I’m doing an informal survey on
the matter. Just send me a postcard with
your crime, sentence, race and a brief
description of media coverage.

Let’s take murder as an example.
Usually, whenever someone white murders
someone (we’re excluding any murders
that involve multiple killings or cannibal-
ism), it tends to be ignored. No, I’m not
saying that these people,_don’t do any time
in prison. I’m saying tie-you just won’t
hear about them. Possibly they will be men-
tioned on the evening news with a com-
ment like, “Jimmy Palonski was arrested
this afternoon as a suspect in the killing of
Jane Doe.” That’s about it, though.

When a black person kills someone,
it’s all over. There’ll be lots of newscasts, all
with the reporter saying something along
the lines of, “Lamont Michael Bates, age
20, was arrested at 4:00 p.m. today. Police
apprehended him on the comer of King
Street and 32nd, where Lamont Michael

Bates was shooting dice while smoking
what appeared to be marijuana. With Bates
were Jamaal Warner, 19, and James Seelar,
23, both of whom were also arrested upon
suspicion of dealing crack cocaine. Lamont
Michael Bates is a suspect in the brutal rape
and murder of little 15 year old Jane Doe.
Jane’s family is utterly distraught at the loss

of their beloved only daughter. Just in case:

you forgot, the name of the alleged murder-
ous bastard is Lamont Michael Bates.”

Next they’ll show a shot of J ane Doe’s
sobbing family in their expensive, profes-
sionally decorated home, then a picture of
Jane as a baby, toddler, small child, preteen,
adolescent  and then her beaten, bloody
body as it was found in a dumpster.

Getting back to our boy Lamont, we
are going to find out everything about him.
First we’ll see the house that Lamont grew
up in, which is about two blocks from
where he currently lives and is probably
condemned. Then we’ll see the park where
he used to play, with the swingless swing
sets, basketball hoops with no nets, the little
building with the bathrooms which are
always locked, the benches chained to
something so no one can steal them and the
backs of the ﬁve dealers who were playing
ball in the park till they saw the camera
crew roll up.

After we’ve seen the comer where
Lamont used to hang out; his morrrrna’s
house, which is where he is currently liv-
ing; the people who keep calling the house

because the phone, water, electricity, or gas
bill is 33 months overdue (the cable is paid,
but since tlrere’s no electricity, it doesn’t
matter); his ﬁve children, all of whom are
under the age of three; his babies’_ mom-
mas; the place where he worked until they
found out he lied on his job application and
ﬁred his sorry self; and several of his
cousins, most of whom
have warrants out on
them, it’s time
for...(drumroll please)
the Interview.

You all know what
I’m talking about. This is
where they pull some
moronic person off the
street and ask him ques-
tions about the crime,
and the person brings
down an entire race by
the stupidity of his
responses. There are two
possible interview can-
didates: the Welfare
Momma and the Pimp.

The Welfare -
Momma will be wearing either a very short
dress that’s so tight you know what she had
for breakfast or very big, baggy clothing
which keeps falling every time she moves.
Her hair will be wrapped up in a rag, par-
tially done, or so perfect you know she just
spent at least $60 on it. It is certain that she
will have her nose pierced and a lot of jew-

elry, probably fake. Several dozen dirty,
screaming children will surround her dur-

ing the interview, ﬁghting continually.
Every so often she’ll smack one of them
upside the head. .

The Pimp will have a jheri curl, a few
missing teeth, several gold teeth, and nine
or 10 pounds of fake gold jewelry around
his neck. One of the pen-
dants will be a dollar
sign, and at least one
other will be a marijuana
leaf. He’ll "be wearing
clothes that would nor-
mally be very expensive,
but he bought them on
the street from someone
who stole them. He will
spit repeatedly during
the entire interview.

Whoever the
person that they choose
is, the person’ will be
functionally illiterate,
unable to speak coher-
ently, and have absolute-
ly no idea what the
crime was. Regardless, he or she is certain
that they know exactly what is going on,
and will talk about it till someone forces
them to shut up.

Jessica Birch wants to know why the televi-
sion media do not at least try to ﬁnd normal
people to interview.

 

Season-ending g
salvation for

Pitt bowl hopes  

Bowl.

After four months of work, 11 games of
heartache and heroism, and countless Buddy
Morris-induced torture tests, the.Pitt football
season can be reduced to a four—letIer word.

, Bowl.

It’s a different four-letter word than this
school is used to saying when summing up a
football campaign. It’s a word that harks
back to the days of Dorsett, the months of
Marine and the Saturdays of Sherrill. It’s a
four-letter word from a time when football
uniforms only had four letters on them and
Vegas Gold stayed in Vegas.

It’s a word Pitt fans haven’t heard in a
while.

Bowl.

If Pistol Pete Gonzalez can ride his band
of Panthers into Morgantown and steal a vic-
tory, all signs point to Miami and a Dec. 29
appearance in the Carquest Bowl.

That’s right. Bowl.

After losses to ‘Temple and Boston
College, a shellacking at the hands of Notre
Dame, and a respectable defeat in Happy
Valley, Pitt is one precious win away from
postseason glory.

How did it happen? Nobody knows. .

Football experts credit Monis and his
conditioning, or Walt Harris and his offense,
or Larry Coyer and his defense. Coaches
credit Gonzalez and his heart, Jake Hoffart

" and his desire, Ernest Coakley and his feroc-

ity, Billy West and his sheer will.

Walt Harris grabbed the microphone
from Steve Pederson after Saturday’s upset
over Virginia Tech and thanked the fans for
their help. He’s thanked Pederson on a num-
ber of occasions; Pederson has retumed the
favor. ‘

There are so many success stories,
nobody knows who to thank It’s a refreshing
change from years past, when nobody knew
who to blame. ' 9'

But all that -— all the car-pushing, touch-
down-catching, quarterback-sacking and
goalpost-destroying —— all that gets put aside.

On Friday, it’s bowl time.

West Virginia is not a team to toy with.
The Mountaineers played the Fighting Irish
much tighter than the Panthers. They
downed the Temple Owls, something the

. Panthers couldn’t manage. They have one of

the best running backs in the country in
sophomore sensation Amos Zeroue, who rat-
tled off 135 yards versus Pitt last season.
They embarrassed the Panthers 34-0 in

Volleyall season ens with a split

Matt Grove
Staff Wrlter

Everyone has heard it or said it
many times before. A ,

All good things must come to an
end.

The good thing known as
Pittsburgh Lady Panther volleyball
came to an end, at least for the 1997
season, last weekend at the Big East
Championships. The Lady Panthers
ﬁnished their season with a 15-13
overall record.

Pittsburgh won their first round
match at the Big East Championships
against Syracuse before falling to
conference powerhouse Notre Dame
in the second round.

The Lady Panthers pushed
Syracuse to a ﬁve-game match before
coming out on top. Pittsburgh took
the first two games 15-5 and 15-7
before dropping the next two 9-15
and 13-15. The Lady Panthers
rebounded to win the ﬁnal game 15-
7 and move on to the second round.

Freshman Marcia Thiesen once
again led Pittsburgh, this time notch-
ing a match-high 17 kills and 30 digs.

Jessica Van Der Mallie added 13
kills and six digs, Melissa Alpers
chipped in with 12 kills and Tara
Haefner recorded a match-high 35
assists to lead Pittsburgh to the win.

Syracuse, who ﬁnished the sea-

' son at 24-12, had two players reach

double—doubles. Rachel Watson had
15 kills and 14 digs while Desiree
Hobbs added 11 kills and 10 digs.
Carrie Urton recorded a team-high 32
assists in the loss.

With the victory, Pittsburgh
moved on to the second round to face
the defending conference champion
Notre Dame.

The youth of the Lady Panthers,
a team with no seniors, wasn’t
served, as Notre Dame knocked
Pittsburgh out of the tournament in
three straight games —— 15-7, 15-11
and 15-9.

Pittsburgh failed to have a single
player notch a double-double in the
loss. Van Der Mallie led Pitt with 10
kill and ﬁve digs.

Alpers added nine kills, Peggy
Meinhart chipped in with eight kills
and eight digs and Thiesen closed out
a stellar freshman campaign with
eight kills and 11 digs. Haeﬁrer again
led all players with 31 assists.

The Fighting Irish, who upped
their record to 22-6 with the win, got
a balanced attack to defeat Pittsburgh.

Jaimie Lee and Angie Harris
each had 12 kills. Lindsay Treadwell
added eight kills and eight digs.
Denise Boylan (21) and Carey May
(17) combined for 38 of Notre
Darne’s 42 assists for the contest.

_ awfully well, in a very tough

staff Wrlter

Billy West has mastered the art and
science of time management in his career
at the University of Pittsburgh. But he
couldn’t have gotten by without a little
help from his friends, family, classmates,
professors, teammates and coaches.

Buddy Morris, strength coach. Sandy
Bishop-Hanson, freshman engineering
advisor. Dr. Ron Brown, director of acad-
emic support services. His fellow engi-
neering classmates, who provided assign-
ments or assistance when West was
absent. West’s family, who has supported
him through all the tumultuous times of
college. He carinottake cred- A
it for his performance all by
himself. Those are just a few
of the many people Billy
West has to thank for all of
his successes at the
University of Pittsburgh.

“He’s very focused,” said
Head Coach Walt Harris.
“He’s the kind of guy who
has his priorities in order. He
knows what he wants to get
done and what he needs to get
done, so he prioritizes his
time and is able to do it ’

academic curriculum as well
as a very demanding football
curriculum.”

When you’re an engi-
neering major and a star
Division I football player,
your focus is directed toward
two entities and two entities
alone. For West, that means
balancing a jam-packed acad-
emic schedule and putting his
5-feet—10, 200—pound frame
through an intense workout
schedule filled with meetings,
weight sessions and 2-and—a-half hour
practices.

West can’t even describe a typical
day for him without questioning where to
begin.
“A day in the life, huh?” he asks,
grinning at the thought. “The days start
early. I don’t really know how to describe
a typical day. Monday we usually don’t
have practice so I try‘ to do most of my
schoolwork then. Tuesday through Friday
is our practice sol start early then also, I
have 8 a.m. classes both Tuesday and
Thursday and classes go all day. Then we
have to lift those two days. Every day is
different, but every day is also the same
and really, there’s not much time to do
anything else.”

And what is the key to the madness
that’s called The Life of Billy West?

“It’s all time management,” West
said. “You have to learn to give a little
sometimes, staying up late and getting up
early. I’ve had a lot of help along the way

West ends live-year run with Panthers

with tutoring and support services. The
people in the support group for athletes
and my friends in engineering try to get
assignments for me if I’m not in class.”

West’s success in the classroom,
which has earned him Athletics Director’s
Honor Roll and ‘Bell Atlantic Scholar-
Athlete honors, has translated into suc-
cess on the ﬁeld in his four years of play-
ing football at Pitt. Taking over for the
injured Curtis Martin at running back two
games into the 1994 season, West capital-
ized on the opportunity presented to him.
In an outstanding sophomore season,
West led the Big East in rushing yardage
with 1,358 yards en route to earning All-
Big East and All—American honors.

Civil engineer West still holds out hope for the National Football League.

But hard times fell upon the 22-year-
old a year later. Injuries plagued his 1995
season, when West played in only two
games. After suffering a broken leg
against Virginia Tech, which shelved
West for the remainder of the season, he
realized that his career in football could
have been hastily abbreviated.

“I think that showed me that after the
year I had  to come back next year and
break your leg, you say to yourself, ‘At
any play it could be over,”’ West said. “I
think the first thing you think when you
get hurt as an athlete is, will I ever play
again? That’s the question you ask your-
self. That ﬂashes in front of you and puts
that much more importance on school,
but then again it also puts that much more
importance, for me, to try and train and
get back to where I was.”

After concentrating on returning to
the running back position, West returned
for the 1996 season. But the arrival of
Dwayne Schulters at running back put a

kink in West’s offensive plans. Despite a
decrease in his playing time under former
Head Coach Johnny Majors that season,
West became familiar with other offen-
sive positions and when Harris took over
as head coach, he used West at fullback
and tailback.

“He has handled these roles tremen-
dously,” Harris said. “He’s a tremendous
leader on this football team, a take-charge
guy, and a tremendous team player, as
well as a tremendous example for the rest
of our players. [He is] an unselfish exam-
ple of a guy that had a lot of great things
happen to him, then had a few injuries,
but Billy’s handled it like a champion.”

In his college football quest, West has
recently been labeled a
“selﬂess” player for step-
ping in at positions that
weren’t his natural forte.
This is in part to Harris’
emphasis on V paying
attention to details, some-
thing which fundarnen—
tally translates to the life
of a civil engineer.

As for West’s life plans,
he wants to pursue foot-
ball first and foremost,
and he has a strong desire
to make it to the National
Football League.

“I want a chance to play
at the highest level,” he
said. “As far as playing,
it’s a dream for every col-
lege player. If you want
to play this game, you
want to play with the
best, and the best are in
the NFL, and that’s
where you want to com-
pete. As soon as the sea-
son is over, that’s where
my aims will be, towards
getting stronger and
faster. I’m looking forward to having my
degree, but football is first and if that
doesn’t work out, then I’ll be able to put
my efforts full strength in engineering.”

Harris foresees different plans for the
senior.

“I think he’s going to get a job, that’s
for sure,” Harris said. “Some smart
employer is going to want to grab a guy
up who’s been through all he’s been
through, academically, as well as in the
area of football. He’s a very, very depend-
able guy, as well as a guy that has been
pushed and has never quit.”

Before the season fmale against West
Virginia, West will be heading home to
Sniithfield, Ohio, for a day to spend
Thanksgiving with his family. Then he
will retum to Pittsburgh and travel to
West Virginia for what could be his final
game in a Panther uniform. After an out-
standing career at Pitt, the Panthers will
be giving thanks for all that West has done
for the program.

Bowl hopes collide in Morgantown for the Backyard Brawl

“I’ve never coached there or

“Schu1ters is doubtful or question-

because he is 100 percent healthy. This
is a big game -— we have to go to those
who are ready to play. Billy has fresh
legs, which is a huge factor.”

West rushed for 130 yards last
weekend, and earned a share in the Big

West Virginia destroyed
the 1996 Pitt Panthers. ‘

This school has to hope
that the 1997 Panthers have
one more afternoon of power
and pride left in them.

They will need West’s
magic. They will need Teny
Mu1phy’s speed, Gonzalez’s
touch and Tony Orlandini’s
strength. They will need the
ferocity of a Curtis McGhee

FROM PAGE 8

Such needs may go
unfulﬁlled: It’s happened
before in Boston and
Philadelphia, where Pitt fans
in attendance have been few.

On Nov. 29, most fans
will be at home — on the
other side of the state or the
country, in some cases —
watching CBS, downing a
turkey sandwich and making
derogatory remarks about

outdoor plumbing every .

time West Virginia moves
the football.

They will not be able to
give Coach Harris the help

. he deserves. It will be up to

the team to stare down a sell-
out crowd and a ﬁerce Oppo-
sition, then come away with
a victory. And a bowl berth.
A loss doesn’t make the
season a failure, but a win
brings Pitt football back for
good. These players deserve
it. This University deserves
it.
And this team can do it.
