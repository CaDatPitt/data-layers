Group Gives On-The-J ob Experience

By roav TROSKY

Pitt students who have
decided on the field of communi-
cations as a career know the
importance of on—the-job expe-
rience while in college to enhance
their employment opportunities.

Career-oriented student
organizations are playing a new
role in the job market today.
Interviewers are not only looking

. for students who do well scholas-
tically but also at students’
school activities and job expe-
riences, according to Susan Har-
land, a College of Arts and
Sciences advisor.

While those students may no
longer have the Internship Office
to look to for help, there are still
other options available. One of
these options is the College of
General Studies’ Communica-
tion Guild.

Although the guild receives its
funding from the CGS Student
Government Board, V CAS stu-
dents are also welcome to partici-
pate, although few choose to do
so.

Throughout the year, people
involved in various aspects of

communications visit and dis-
cuss the possible opportunities
that are available in the ﬁeld.
Harry Factor from ABC News in
New York, Pat Livingston, the
sports editor for The Pittsburgh
Press, and Ted Windt, a profes-
sor here at Pitt, arejust a few of
the many speakers who appear
each year.

I

i he guild also sponsors a writ-
ing competition, which is funded
by the Alumni Association. For
this activity, students submit a
piece previously written for a
class. A $200 first prize is one
incentive for students, and the
possibility of having the story
printed in The Night Times is
another.

Unfortunately, there is no spe-
cific job placement service
through the guild, although it
can help indirectly by exposing
students to various aspects of the
field. There is also a limited
amount of information on file
available for interested students.

Garnette Lewis, chairman for
the guild, said the professional
backing from the community is
another big boost when it comes
to job placement.

“The guild has helped me

expand my horizons and get
ideas about what is out there for
me.” said Barbara Sturni, guild
co-chairman.

One of the few organizations

not affected by inflation, the _

membership fee is only $5 a year,
and that is money well spent.
This year, one of the special fea-
tures will be the Clio Awards film
which deals with advertising in
the various media.

The biggest obstacle the guild
faces is enrollment.

“It is almost as if we are
floundering,” Sturni said. “I
would hate to see all of the hard
work put to waste if people do
not continue to participate and
the guild dies.”

“The guild is a worthwhile
organization,” Lewis said. “If it
takes changing the by-laws that
now limit it CAS enrollment or
setting up a separate group for
day students, it is worth it.”

A meeting to determine actual
interest for the coming school
year is going to be held July 20 at
8 p.m. in room 423 of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Many‘ students this fall may be
surprised to find that their student
loan check is only half of what is
expected. Two major lending
institutions—Mellon and Pitts-
burgh National Banks——are disburs-
ing loans in multiple payments
rather than one lump sum at the
beginning of the school year.

One of the reasons for the switch
is that the federal government pays
the interest on student loans and will
pay interest on a full year’s loan even
if it is ‘disbursed in multiple
payments.

“[The banks] could bill the federal V

government on the full amount of
the loan approved, even though they
woulld make more tham one disbur-
sement,” according to Laverne
Borst, regional director of the Pen-
nsylvania Higher Education Assist-
ance Agency (PHEAA).

One Mellon Bank official said the
federal government encourages mul-
tiple disbursements to prevent any
misuse of the funds by the student.

Another source from Mellon
Bank said the new process will help

determine when a student leaves
school, either to graduate or to
transfer to another school.

Mellon Bank is the largest lender
of Guaranteed Student Loans out of
over 500 lending institutions in the
state.’ Some of these lenders have
been working in multiple disburse-
ments since 1980.

On Pitt’s main campus, PHEAA
approve about 9,300 applications
last year, amounting to about $21.8
milion in loans. Director of Admis-
sions and Student Aid Daniel May
said he doesn’t know yet how many
Pitt sstudents the new process will
affect. 0

Most banks haven't switched to
the multiple disbursement method
Borst said, because of the compli-
cated records that have to be kept
and the amount of paperwork
involved in making the loan in two
payments.

May said the additional work may
present 'a problem in his office.
Another potential problem sur-
rounds the fact that some lending
institutions will use the new process
and some will continue to give loans
once a year.

New SHRP Dean Named

Jerome Martin, an assistant to the
chancellor at Pitt‘, has been named
the dean of the School of Health
Related Professions (SHRP), Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar announced last
week.

Martin, who served as associate
professor and chairman of the
department of Physical Therapy in
SHRP before joining the chancel-
lor’s staff in 1980, replaces Dr. Anne
Pascasio, who resigned the deanship
in December 1982.

Martin received his undergradu-
ate education at Penn State, a mas-
ter‘s degree from Boston University
and his Ph.D. in adminstration of
higher education from Pitt. He has
written a number of scientific arti-
cles and is active in several profes-
sional organizations including the
American Physical Therapy Associ-
ation, and the Pennsylvania Physi-
cal Therapy Association where he
served as vice chairman from 1977 to
1981 and a president for the past two
years.

Policeman’s Preliminary
Hearing ls Postponed

The preliminary hearing for
campus policeman Joseph R.
Marquez, for July I, has been
moved to July l5. Marquez is
facing charges of aggravated

assault, recklessly endangering
another person and violating a
city ordinance that prohibits the
unlawful firing of a gun.

The university is wrapping up
its investigation of the incident,

in which Marquez fired a shot at
two men early in June.

Although the investigation is
nearing a close, assistant director
of the Pitt Department of Public
Safety Walter Waters said the

university has not taken any
further action against Marquez
and that he ,is still suspended
from the campus police force.

Bank Loan Policy Changed

continued from page one

“It's confusing,” May said. “Some
institutions will [shift processes] and
some of them won’t. Any time you’re
dealing with 500 sources and there’s
not a consistent way of doing busi-
ness, there’s a problem.”

May said another problem with
the process is the timing of its enac-
tion. Although Mellon Bank noti-
fied borrowing students on the
change, and Pitt included informa-
tion about it in the “Financial Aid

Update,” May said many students
still do not know it is happening.

“It came at the last minute,” he
said. “In the short run, it's kind of
quick to hit someone. In the long
run, it’ll probably help most stu-
dents because it’ll help budgetary
constraint on the part of the
student.”

Borst denied that it would be a
potential problem for students.

“I n reality, it should not [present a
problem] because the loan is for a
full academic year. If the student is
budgeting with his family, tiiere
should be money from other so pp ces

\

that help out each.

Under the mulytiple disbursement
process, the student does not have to
come back to the bank for second-
term registration. The remainder of
the loan is automatically forwarded
to the student.

Borst said the policy is not a
blanket agreement, and exceptions
can be made through the bank. One
such exception would be a school
that requires full payment for the
loan at the beginnning of the year, as
many technical and trade schools
do. '

Annual Regatta Events Announced

The featured event of this
year’s Three Rivers Regatta is

A recent Supreme Court ruling may clear the
way for government to grant tax credits to par-
ents who send their children to private schools.
With education one of the hottest political sub-

.. jects these days, we can expect many earsfull of
rhetoric about tuition tax credits before Election
Day 1984.

Following the high court's opinion, not many

- opponents of tuition tax credits will cling to the
argument that such credits, which would indi-
rectly benefit many parochial schools, unlawfully
link church and state. Yet there remain good

reasons why tuition tax credits, even if constitu-
tional, are bad policy.

Aside from questions of their economic and

_ racial fairness, the most worrisome feature about
tax credit plans is that they are, more or-less

expressly, incentives to abandon, rather than
support, the public schools. »

Whether tax credits come from federal, state or
local coffers, they increase the segment of the
population for whom private schools are an
affordable alternative. Tax credit advocates
argue that as students bail out of public schools in
favor of private educations, dollar-per-student
ratios in public institutions must rise.

These gains are won, however, at the expense
of the very logic of collectively funded education.

Or perhaps we have forgotten that only if every-
one contributes can we afford to educate every
child.
To give the rich their money back is to return to
-the every-man-for-himself system under which
only the rich can afford more than the crudest
schooling. '
Tuition tax-credit plans also make it easier for
public officials to abandon public schools. The
standard and unsupported claim that “a little
competition will be good for school systems” is a
smokescreen behind which hide many real inad-
equacies in funding, administration and teaching
. in the public schools. To improve education,
these problems have to be addressed—-—whether or
not the competition is thriving.

..  - -Asfriends and fees of tuition tax credits will all

affirm, free education for all is a keystone of our

' society and economy. But freeeducation for all
requires that we all hold to our pledge to support
the public schools.

The latest trend in news reporting
is to leave the public guessing.

Nowadays, it seems that journal-
ists are more interested in finding
people who look like jerks on
camera than in finding, much less
reporting, facts. .

If you‘ve seen. any of the following i

performances, you know what I
mean: .

0 The camera focuses on a closed
door, the reporter says, “But he
could not be reached for comment.
Back to you, Dan.”

0 The interviewer badgers his ner-
vous prey, drawing the expected
stuttering response. It looks like he’s
lying, hiding something. Is he? Per-
haps the reporter found out the
truth. Maybe he'll tell us what really
happened when the interview‘s over.
Alas, no. Nothing more than a cut
“Back to you, Patty.”

Don‘t get mewrong, I'm glad to
know that this guy wouldn’t com-
ment and that guy is probably lying,
but I want to know more. After all,
the interview is not the story, but
only a way to get the story, A repor-
ter who leaves us to guess at the truth
his victims wouldn't give has not
done his job

‘Columns

The Pitt News encourages
and accepts column submis-
sions from interested faculty,

2 missions should be typed and

tinues to be a big seller, and
scandal-mongering can secure a
place in the sun for the likes of Mor-

result is that a reporter can be a suc-

stories. Just roll the cameras at the

Gay Rights

Q: May employers lawfully discrimi-
nate against employees on the basis of
sexual preference?

A: Private employers may lawfully
discriminate against people based on
their sexual preference.

At present, federal legislation pro-
tects women, racial minorities and
certain other groups but not gays. A
bill that would outlaw discrimination
on the basis of “affectional or sexual
orientation” has been pending in
Congress for several years. The
courts have so far rejected the theory
that for federal prohibition of dis-
crimination against minorities that is
found in the 1964 Civil Rights Act
extends to gay men and women

Governmental employees, how-
ever, whether state, local or federal,
are subject to constitutional require-
ments and must treat all citizens fairly
and even-handedly. The Federal Civil
Service has adopted a policy which
prohibits discrimination based solely
on a person’s sexual orientation,

Q: WHat is the Council for Sexual
Minorities?

A: The Council for Sexual Minori-
ties was formed in Pennsylvania in
1975 by an executive order of former
Governor Milton Shapp. This Coun-
cil is charged with the responsibility
of processing complaints of and edu-
cating the public about issues of
homosexual discrimination including
discrimination in state agency
employment.

Q: Do any states recognize legal mar-
riages between individuals of the

'*t*i°l'£*tit‘*~ii4sti‘i°4ti°n-

A: No, and this has some important
legal consequences for the gay cou-
ple. Such consequences include no
legal entitlement to support by the
other, discrimination in insurance
plans such as ineligibility for family
rate coverage under Blue Cross or
Blue Shield and higher rates of inher-
itance tax upon the death of a
partner.

However, gay couples, even
though they cannot legally marry,
may own property together and enter
into joint financial obligations to
third parties.

Q: How does the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) apply
the provisions under which gay aliens
may be excluded from the United
States?

A: The INS has recently changed its
policy on how it will enforce this law.
Under the new agency guidelines,
only persons who make an “unsoli-
cited, unambiguous oral or written
admission for homosexuality" to
immigration inspectors will be sub-
ject to exclusion. Wearing buttons or
T-shirts or possessing literature sup-
porting gay rights will not by them-
selves be grounds for further
questioning.

Q: Can any landowner or landlord
discriminate against gays?

A: In most cases, no. However, the
Higher Courts in some western or
highly agricultural states have
recently upheld legislation allowing
ranch owners to refuse to allow gays
to live or work near their property,
citing the high incidence of leather

rock-n-roll. That's right,
they've been hatching this plot
ever since Zenyatta Mondatta. See,
they diverted everyone’s
attention with songs like "De
Do Do Do, De Da Da Da” and
then, while everyone was
mouthing these simple animal-
like noises, 01’ Sting and the
boys threw in some complica-
tions like "Driven To Tears,”
etc., et al. Nobody seemed to
notice.

Then came Ghost In The
Machine and the Police carried
their scheme farther. Once

‘again, they threw up a smoke-

screen with ”Every Little Thing
She Does Is Magic,” but then
they clutched for the cerebrum
with their cosmic sonatas and
symphonies: ”Spirits In The
Material World,” ”Invisible
Sun," ”Secret Journey"-the
first mentioned even made it
onto AM playlists. Their plot
was almost completed.

Now, Synchronicity is here and
it seems to complete a trilogy of

sorts. It is the Police's
weightiest album to date, but it

A is also their most professional.

The album is a study in
complexity with every song, but
one, dripping intricacies and
musical nuances. Ironically, the
one cut that abstains from the
norm, "Every Breath You
Take,” is as simplistic as the
others are complex. It is
arguably the Police's best single
to date and will probably
conclude as one of the year's
best. It_will also mask, quite
effectively, the course of the
rest of the album.

That course is a little farther
left of Ghost In The Machine than
expected, but nevertheless its
message is closer to home than
its predecessor. The title comes
from Carl Jung who coined/the
word ”synchronicity” during his
extensive work with extrasen-
sory perception and psychology.
Quite aptly, the music fits the
nomenclature as Synchronicity is
saturated with an almost
unconscious musical and lyrical
subtleness. The sound is the
familiar Police beat, but
underneath there is something
much more erudite brewing. As
usual, Sting has written the
bulk of the album, and as usual,
he has composed eight songs

 

THE POLICE -

that are as intelligent as they are
listenable. However, this time
the former schoolteacher is
demanding more from his
audience—-they must listen and
not just hear, for they will miss
the intricate bass runs, drum
patterns, and synthesized
guitar charts that seem to have
both an apparent and a
subliminal design. They must
listen or they will not hear the
warning in ”Walking In Your
Footsteps,” the anguish in
"Synchronicity II,’’ or even the
lines from ”Every Little Thing
She Does Is Magic” that have
been deftly placed in ‘'0 My
God.”

wcAs£

Synchronicity is Sting’s thesis
on music and life—he
combined the complexities of
both in an album that abridges
the gap between academia and
commercialism. Strangely

has '

enough, Andy Summers seems‘

to attempt the same thing on his
one contribution to the album,
"Mother." Unfortunately, he
comes off sounding like he
stayed at Robert Fripp’s house
one too many nights.
This album is not for every-
one. For casual Police fans and
those who enjoy the band's

single material, Synchronicity asks

too much of the listener to be
appreciated. However, for those
who have welcomed the band's
metamorphosis into a trio of
ultra-professional musicians,
this album is astounding. For
those willing to put forth the

effort, Synchronicity accomplishes’

its self—imposed task of making
music the sixth sense.

”We Live So Past”/
"Temptation”
Heaven 17

Arista

Big, bona-fide hit overseas
and in the dance clubs here in
the U.S. Worthy? Yes. ”Temp-
tation” is not an excruciating 10
minutes long like so many 12-
inch dance mixes, and, hell, if
that isn't reason enough to buy
it, it's also got the catchiest half-
second intro around—it just
sorta goes swooiiissshhh! before it
delves into the main course.
”Temptation” is one of those
”bit”songs: the sound is nearly
overwhelming with lots of
orchestration, commanding
vocals and snazzy lines stolen

from that prayer the nuns used
to make you say every morning
to help save your poor, hedonis-
tic soul (”...and lead us not into
temptation.”). The real marvel
of this song, however, is the
guest vocals of Karol Kenyon,
whose voice serves, swoops and
volleys more than Martina Nav-
ratilova’s formidable forehand
at Wimbledon. Much like the
female vocalist on Heaven 17's
wonderful "Penthouse and
Pavement,” Kenyon’s the decid-
ing factor that turns this good
song into a great song, which
leads me to wonder why
Heaven 17 doesn't have a per-
manent, female member to do
these increasingly regular vocal
chores. Oh, yeah, the other

 AI N'_-'[AV3H .-------------

side's real nice, too, danceable
and all that, with lots of showy
echo—type effects thrown in for
interest. But maybe it could be
great if there were some female
vocals backing it...

THE KEY
loan Armatrading

A&:M

Joan Armatrading can't keep
still. Her artistry has been one
of perpetual transition: from
folk to jazz, reggae, and lately,
rock. Armatrading’s music
remains unclassifiable——except
as concerns the category of
musical excellence. The Key, her
ninth release, continues with
Armatrading’s tradition of non-
traditionality as it shuns any
label save for ”good music.”

While The Key is not her best
release, it is by far her most
accessible-—there is even a
potential FM single in ”Drop
The Pilot” and a massive hype
campaign in the works. Public-
ity or not, Armatrading gleams
on this album. It is her vocals, as
usual, that catch the listener
first and often unawares. Her
voice is a unique blend of femi-

  . _ . ...FR.Al\1K..!2l.G.IA.CQMQ ..... ..

ness that often fakes androgyny
and then unexpectedly soars
into a line of high notes that
burn holes in tweeters. This is‘
most evident in ”Foolish Pride”
and ”Drop The Pilot,” where
Armatrading’s voice leaves
some question as to her
gender-—that is, until she hits
the choruses.

The music on The Key is large-
ly upbeat and toys with rock-n-
roll in the same way that the
Talking Heads’ Remain In Light
did, though it's not as heavy on
the African polyrhythms. In
addition, Armatrading has
roundedup fine musicians such
as King Crimson’s Tony Levin
and Adrian Belew to help out,
not to mention Stewart Cope-
land and Jerry Marotta.

Armatrading’s use of two
decidely different producers
(Steve Lillywhite and Val
Garay) and the accessibility of
The Key seem to point to yet
another direction for her. In the
past, Armatrading’s musicians
never seemed concerned with
grabbing mass public accep-
tance———instead she seemed to
aim more for turning out excep-
tional music. Now, it appears
that loan Armatrading wants
both, and by the sound of The
Key, she's got her hand on the
right door knob.

OFF BALANCE, THE REAL
WORLD OF BALLET

By Suzanne Gordon

 
   
   

Pantheon

There are some things in this world
which should remain a fantasy, and
ballet is one of them. Just as magic
loses its mystical illusion once the

lmagician’s secrets are revealed, so

does ballet, once the curtain is
lowered and the show is over.

It seems that the world of ballet is
not the one of filmy costumes, silken
toe shoes, curtain calls and auto-

‘ graphs that is imagined when watch-

ing the prima ballerina swirl across
the stage in the arms of a man like
Baryshnikov.

In her Off Balance, The Real World of

_ Ballet, Suzanne Gordon strips away

the glitter and glamour from the
dance world and discusses the harsh
realities that fade into the back-

ground once the orchestra begins to i

play and the corps begins to dance.
Obviously, the program for a ballet
does notvdiscuss the long hours of

,

l.‘

grueling practice, the devastating
injuries that can destroy a dancer's
career, or the starvation diets that
make anorexia nervosa so common
that no one even blinks an eye when a
dancer who is 5’11” weighs 98
pounds. 50, Gordon fills the void.

Perhaps there is a reason for this
gap in information. The circumstan-
ces presented in Gordon's book make
the ballet enthusiast realize that
being a ballerina doesn't come with
fairytale ease, and that many‘ of the
dancers who are so idolized in the
audience's mind are really victims of
an inhumane, unrealistic world;
these people dedicated their lives to
dance. When the curtain rises, the
audience expects to be swept away
into a world of elegance and grace,
not a world of harsh realities.

If a teenager is pondering a career
in ballet, Off Balance should be manda-
tory reading. If, however, ballet
serves as an escape from a long, hard
day, the program at the theater
should be enough to satisfy the need
to find out about the life of a favorite

THE TRAGIC TALE OF THE DOG

‘WHO KILLED HIMSELF .

By Richard W. Jennings
Bantam I

The Tragic Tale of the Dog Who Killed
Himself by Richard W. Jennings is a
philosophic fable of a typical subur-

ban family told from a young boy's

point of view. His father's concern is
satisfying the platonic needs of his
family; Mother is a dissatisfied hypo-
chondriac. The memoir begins with
the acquisition of the title pet, a
Schipperke, a ”bear-l'ke creature

 

with no tail” and a pedigree. Crom-
well is the dog's name, and why he
”chose to end it all” is explained in the
story. ’
To protect his investment, the
boy's father builds backyard fences,
which successfully ostracize the dog
from the family. The dog is allowed
more freedom when Mom decides
she wants a divorce; Dad moves out,
and Cromwell shuffles between the

when the divorce is canceled and
Mom and Dad reunite,Cromwell’s
confusion intensifies—according to
the boy—narrator—and the dog opts
for suicide. ”They come into the
world as animals and they leave as
people...Cromwell had succeeded in
becoming a member of the family and
it was just too much for him,” writes
Jennings.

Eighteen black and white photo-
graphs by Joan Van der Veen—
standard boy-and-dog stuff—accom-
pany the text, a sort of canine Ionathan
Livingston Seagull, with symbolism
spread just as thick. The book strad-
dles two potential audiences with its
simple style, told via the young boy in
language suitable for children but
with the insight of a grown man and
implications which children will
probably not understand. Still, The
Tragic Tale of the Dog Who Killed Himself
offers a valid comment on priorities
and how they affect the (sometimes
powerless) people involved.

Prcicntious "About the dog” notes
replace the usual author biography at
the end of the story: ’’He is alive and
well and living the life of Riley in
Kansas...he never has to settle for dry
food...and he -dreams in color." This
cute segment would best be elimi-
nated, as it tends to invalidate what
precedes it. I

Ending The Rebellion:
Explanations In

By MARIA BARBUTO

"Go boom boom every night. Boom
Boom Boom." Fred holds his ears .and
steps up to his door step.

Shelley says, "That's why we're
breaking up."

Well, that's only one reason.
There's Pittsburgh, and financial
woes and not getting taken seriously
and frustration and.....and boredom.

qYep, Dress Up As Natives are

’ ored after two and a half years of
battling with the Banana and feuding
with Styx fanatics in public places and
just the general hassle of it all here.
They didn't get out 'cause they
couldn't agree on which city to move
to, they didn't have the money, they
weren't ready—stuff like that kept
them here long enough for the stag-
nant shroud of the Pittsburgh music
scene to stifle their sounds.

But nonetheless, they did exist, and
they did put out a single, a good sin-
gle, too...ummmmm, they got
reviewed in OP magazine and, most

ortantly, they were a FUN band
and every now and then, they had
fun, too. Their origins were rooted in
some random people, bored with
school, who wanted to play music and
were pissed off about the situation
here, there and in most places. Their
songs, "What a Man," "Affairs," "A
Lie," "Rape II," and "Misery and Fun"
deal with a lot of things you'd have to
think about if you lived in Oakland or
crawled through college at some
point. The Natives adopted a unique
way to look through the rot, not the

§9.uke'em.....NOW" doctrine spit up

0

y the Dead Kennedy's and other
quintessential punks, but a "yeah it's

shitty ..... ..BUT" sort of view cranked
out via their trashy, choppy but pop-
ish sound—it was like they were
watching a film with themselves in it
and it wasn't a great film because the
scenes were grey and banal in the city
and the band didn't get to play that
much and they didn't have any
money, but hey it was O.K. because it
‘couldn't go on for too long, right?

_ But that's not to say they weren't
'angry. Certainly, anger is a motivat-
ing force and will definitely get a band
started and some songs written and,
in this case, a record, but then there's
uh, boredom.

It's Friday, June 10, and Dress Up
plays a last gig at the Electric Banana.
Upstairs, the band drinks beer, much
beer, and downstairs someone sets
up to make a video titled ”Intoxica-
tion and Change.”

mutant mini—mar_ts. Maybe it's the
way she plants a hand on her hip and
dangles the other one over her key-
boards, lights a ciggie, takes a swig of
Rolling Rock and all just like she's
kidding...but then again, she's proba-
bly not, not with a ring in her nose
and a spider on her tit and a potential
dragon on her back (she's into
tatoos).

Dawn said that someone else said
that Friday night was "very effi-
cient.” And it was, it was, but that
part of the film should have been loud
and BIG and.....and when Dawn
sings, she doesn't look like she's hav-
ing any fun and Beth just sort of
punks away in a somewhat expres-

Dawn and Gina at a Market Square gig.

  

sionless style that doesn't really say
that much about her. Or maybe all of
this is just screaming and the fact that
the Natives went out like that says
that this is the way bands die in
Pittsburgh—real fast, real quiet; they
just slip off the screen. So many
bands, the Cardboards, the Wherea-
bouts, the Wake, oh so many. Well,
there's no place to play and the com-
munity support system seems to be
confined to certain subcultures in
Oakland and the Fine Arts depart-
ment at CMU.

O.K., so it's tough for all the bands
here. ”It's a real depressing place to
try to get anything done," Beth says.
Agreed, but it was probably even
tougher for the Natives just 'cause
they lacked some Y chromosomes.
They struggle to be taken seriously as
real people in a real band rather than
just a bunch of neat-loking girls pav-

.ing the way before the Go—Go's

became the major issue——even larger
than the pushto play a strain of music
that fell like wet wash cloths against
the ears of the Van Halen for Gods’
audience. Other bands didn't have to

Gina: "Yeah I think we were a fun
band, but I think we were fun to the
point where no one took us seriously.
If we were guys doing the same thing,
we'd be on par with Flipper (an L.A.-
based rock band, not the dolphin).
Look at how many bands do, like,
junk that is, like, drivel and get taken

\seriously. I'm not saying that what
V we did wasn't drivel at times...”

Dawn: "And then again when you
get famous, like Chrissie Hynde, then
you're a great guitar player.
TWANG.....twang TWANG."

Gina (again): "Joan Iett can't even
play and sing at the same time."

In addition to finding the balance
between the FUN quota and trying to
look like they meant what they sang,
there were other problems. The
Natives got harassed ('waddaya do,
you play in-stru-ments?') by the
generic Oakland population.

”Wel1 I saw 'Dress Up As Shit’ in
the bathroom at the Banana," Gina
says. Yeah, well, there was some suc-
cess, like with the review in OP maga-
zine. "Murky jerky circa Velvet
Underground," those "cheesy" key-
boards belong to Gina, the "rumbley"
bass is all Beth (”I work real hard at
it"), Dawn and/or her guitar is "ato-
nal" and Shelley plays "barrundy"
drums or some such word. .

Not bad, eh??? No, not bad, but
now they're gone and Brian from the
Five, (the one who smiles a lot) says,
”It's sort of’ sad, don't you think?"
Yeah, it is, but it's not just sad, no, uh,
it means something. Somehow it
means something that these girls
couldn't pull it off, or didn't get the
chance to, it's just absurd, that's all,
cause why not them? They had
Gina-—bright as shit, abrasive,
charged, and entertaining——nicely
offset by Dawn—cool, aloof, " very
European, just as sarcastic but
subtle—Beth——sort of mysterious
but solid—and most recently, Shel-
ley, hacking away in the back,
bouncy, light, upbeat. A really inter-
esting and appealing combination.
So, it's just too absurd that the bore-
dom got to them before anything else‘
did. Or not absurd, just really
pathetic: it says something about
being here, or being unable to change
things, or being young and frustrated
or unemployed or different .... ..yeah,
it says all those things.

But they gave it a shot and that
means something, too, cause they
had fun periodically and it was better
than vegging in class and thinking
about it a lot but never really going
for it. And, too, they lived the life,for

a fewxylears, maybe» not the-..g’l.itte,ri-'

but the band life nonetheless. Hey,
they got to be cool in Oakland, hang
out with the Five and have fun parties
at the Krishna house when you could
still stick things in the walls (before
they got painted), and Gina probably
has a running tab at the tattoo shop.
That's notoriety. With a little imagi-
nation, they can twist things enough
to have some good memories and a
few stories to tell somebody else's
kids. I

But when they look back on career
highlights, they see .... ..ummm, a
photo session at the Pittsburgh
Zoo....uh, the time Gina got stoned

and forgot to turn her equipment“

on...and, uh....well...well, it probably
wasn't that glamorous and it also
looks like most people aren't going to
miss them that much or, even, not at
all and some people never even knew
about them.

When Mission of Burma played
their last show at the Bradford Hotel
ballroom in Boston, it was a tear-

filled, groupie-infested, we're-

gonna-miss-this-band type of
occasion with the group unifying the
audience via strains of discordant
harmonies. Maybethat strong sense
of community was really just sym-
pathy for Roger Miller's tinnitus
(been listening to too much Mission
of Burma, eh Rog?) or lust for Clint
Conely but either way, Boston
reacted as if some part of its musical
background had melted and dripped
away. Backing from Beantown made
that band and kept it going, too.
Yeah, to make it outside your own
city maybe, just maybe, you gotta
have good music and talent and stuff
like that, but inside your own town??
Nawww, flesh and blood, you know?

So wha'happen? Some one answer
that please.

Awwwwright, waddaya do when
your band fizzles out and you really
don't have any ear problems to blame
it on, it just sort of happened and all,
so then what? School? Another
band? Work (and/or job)? Investment
banking?

Well, in the afterlife, Dawn and
Shelley will hook up with other ex-
local band members to create
"Ulcers" (some grafitti already
exists), Beth will find academia in the
mornings and Gina, well, Gina takes
orders at C]'s' for now but there's
always Harvard Law or Wharton-
watch that spider!

So Dress Up As Natives is dissolved
and a little more disillusioned, played-
out and tired of fighting, on their way
back to reality. Well, sort of; But it

fﬁund themselves competing against‘

 

By TODD ERKEI.

Although  played basketball
on ‘opposite ends. of the state, Curtis
Aiken’ and “Dwayne Washington

 ne another for all the accolades and

schoolboy honors the state of New
York had to bestow.

Both have since chosen to play
their college basketball at Big East
schools, Aiken at Pitt and Washing-
ton‘ at Syracuse, promising four
more years of this friendly battle.
Judging from some of their past con-
frontations, the fans filling the Car-
rier Dome and Fitzgerald Field
House next season should be watch-
ing attentively.

The two shot it out during the 

ﬁnals of last summer’s Empire State
Games, and when it was over
Washington had scored 45 points
while Aiken settled for 43 and a vic-

ry for his Bennett High School
team that more than surprised the
basketball watchers from New York
City. I’

Washington played for Boys and
(now) Girls High in Brooklyn where
he earned one of the game's more
hallowed nicknames. “Pearl." He
will bring that moniker, along with a
high school legacy packed with all-
American honors and impressive
ﬁgures (a 6-2, 205 pound frame and
a 34.4 points per game scoring aver-
age) with him to Syracuse.

Aiken, who goes simply by the
name Curtis, will always be remem-
bered by the city of Buffalo and his

Bennett High School team as the
r -0

young man who brought the N.Y.
Public, High School Championship
upstate where it has seldom been
seen. Aiken does what. few point
guards can choose to do. that is,
score points with long-range
jumpers—as proven by a 36.5 points
per game scoring average——and go
up in the air where even most small
forwards can not follow.

Last week they set aside any
thoughts of future showdowns to

ports 

Curtis Aiken

play together on the East squad
competing in the National Sports
Festival in Colorado Springs. Aiken
and Washington led the youngest of
the festival’s four teams——eight
incoming freshmen on the squad or
l2—to the basketball ﬁnals last Fri-
day only to lose to the South squad,
132-131.

The East team prepared for the
festival with four days of practice
under the direction of coach George
Blaney of Holy Cross. Under festival
rules, each player must be given
nearly an equal amount of playing
time. The 12-member teams were
broken into two platoons of six
players each.

“The difficult part was not only
assembling a team in four days, but
assembling two six-man teams in
four days, which was essentially

 

what we were doing,” Blaney said.

A selection committee made up of
coaches and conference officials
picked the 48 players who partici-
pated in the festival, all of whom had
to be 20 years of age or younger to
compete. Georgetown head coach
John Thompson chaired the com-
mittee that selected the East squad.

“It [the sports festival] gives some
of the players a chance to gauge how
far away they are actually from
being college players,” Panther
assistant coach Reggie Warford
said. “They have very, very
advanced games for high school
seniors but it is still a bit of" an
adjustment.”

Aiken thinks the adjustments he
must make in the college game will
be primarily physical ones which
will come with his maturity.

 

‘ The Pitt News, Wednesday July 6, l9B3 _

“The caliber of player that I will
be playing against in college is sim-
ilar to those [players] here," Aiken-
said. “I think theonly adjustment 1
‘will have to make is getting used to
being bumped off the ball. Once I get
used to all the shoving, then I think I
can step right‘ in without any
problem.” ‘

Aiken, the only member of the
East squad that Blaney had never
seen in action, played point on one
East platoon and, fittingly,
Washington took that spot on the
other. I

“I had heard some really good
things about him [Aiken]. I knew
that he could score points,” Blaney
said. “He is very quick and he seems
to be able to penetrate when he
wants to. We probably asked him to
set up a little bit more than he is
likely to do."

Aiken had six points and nine
assists in 16 minutes of play in the
East’s first game, a 132-130 loss to
the North team. He started the
second game, responding with 16
points including a crowd-pleasing
dunk at the buzzer.

“I‘ve been playing well, and I
think the coach realizes that,” Aiken

. said after his 16-point performance.
“I think the point guard should
know the capabilities of everyone on
his team, when to give him the ball
and in what situations.

“It’s hard to learn that in just four
days,” Aiken said, “but I think I'm
doing just what Coach Chipman
would be expecting of me.”

Panther head coach Roy Chip-
man will be expecting a lot from
Aiken—the one, and some say only,
high school blue-chipper Pitt has
ever lured away from a big-name
school such as Kansas University,
where they thought Aiken was

. signed, sealed and all but fitted for

his Jayhawk’s uniform.

Chipman and others think Aiken
will provide Pitt with an alternative
scoring punch to go along with
Clyde Vaughan, something the
emerging Panthers need if they hope

 

 

J.

' to improve upon last season's 13-15

overall record and sixth-place finish
in the Big East conference race. '
Chipman has prescribed” a. pre-
season lesson in the push 
no-autopsy, no-foul game" “of
summer-league ‘ba,sketbal1.,..fgor7
Aiken. He will begin playing in the
renowned Connie Hawkins League"
next week, most likely joining the
team that includes Pitt’s Keith Arm- '
strong and freshman recruit Marlon’
Ferguson. League rules permit only
one college letterman on a team. '

Clyde Vaughan, who is currently-
playing in the World University.
Games in Edmonton, Alberta,
would like Aiken to play for his
entry in the summer league, accord-
ing to Wolford.

“They would certainly comple-
ment each other,” Wolford said, “as
we think Curtis will complement all
of our players.”

The pre-season tests, whether they
are up in the Rockies or on the
asphalt of the East Hills, still only
begin to measure a young player’s -
abilities.

“I think he can play in the Big I

East,” Blaney said. “The problem
that any ‘reputation’ player has, and
certainly Curtis has gained a good
reputation, is that people will expect
him to come in and be a super player
as a freshman. What we tell our
players is that by sophomore year,
you will be a 40 percent better bas-
ketball player just for having gone
through freshman year.” ’

Blaney went on to name a possible
exception to that rule, the man-boy’
they call “Pearl.”

“I have rarely seen a high school ‘

player as physical as he is,” Blaney
said. “I don’t think physically he will
have to make any adjustments; he is
just a magnificent basketball
player."

The 1983-84 season will be the
next test that Aiken and Washing-
ton will take together. Again, they
will be competing for the best marks.

By SCOTT DELLETT

The big decision has been
made. Not that everyone has
been waiting with bated breath,
but Panther all-around athlete
Roger Kingdom has finally come
up with a verdict—football will
take a back seat to track in 1983,
and he will pursue .a spot on the
United States Olympic team.

Judging from last weekend’s
results from the National Sports
Festival in Colorado Springs, the
choice was the correct one.
Kingdom finished behind Willie
Gault in the 110-meter hurdles,
but that is not the positive aspect
of his performance.

First, he finished one-
hundredth of a second—-a dis-
tance almost impossible to judge
by eye—-—behind Gault. Second,
he cut six-tenths of a second off
his NCAA-championship time
of 13.54.

Kingdom's improvement dur-
ing the last two months is only
slightly short of phenomenal. At
the Big East Championships in
May, Kingdom finished behind

Rodney Wilson of Villanovq

with a time of 14.02. Now, he is
challenging the best hurdlers in
the world.

One could only imagine the;
progress Kingdom could have
made had he been able to
practice earlier in the outdoor
season. The 6-2, 180-lb. native of .
Unadilla, Ga., instead attended
spring football practice, where
he fell behind Tom Flynn and
Texas-El Paso transfer Bill
McCormick in the depth chart at
free safety. As much as his value
on the track has risen, his value
on the football field has dropped
considerably.

Now, Kingdom will pursue the
dream very few ever have the
chance to pursue, the dream of
representing his country in the
Olympics. How realistic that
dream is will be further
determined as Kingdom
participates in the World
University Games in Edmonton,
where he will recieve a taste of
international competition.

His chances to be at Los
Angeles next summer may
partially hang on a decision
made within the next couple of

  Kingdom Hurdles

To Olympic Dream

weeks, a choice similar to
Kingdom's.

Gault, who has quickly been
rivaled by Kingdom, must soon
decide which is more impor-
tant——the bundle of cash being
dangled by the Chicago Bears,
who drafted him No. l in the
recent National Football League
draft, or going after his goal of
the Olympics.

But there is a difference
between his and Kingdom's
choice——Foge Fazio has given
his blessing to Kingdom‘s quest.
The second-year coach realizes
the public relations benefits the
university could gain from an
Olympic athlete.

Also, a break from football
could benefit both Kingdom and
Fazio in the future. Kingdom's
football career at Pitt so far has
been undistinguished, and he has
admitted that a changed attitude
could help out his second sport.

But now track is numero mm
with Kingdom, and he is going
full throttle down a runway that
may be paved with gold, silver or
bronze.

Roger Kingdom will take a redshi rt this season to pursue a
spot on the 1984 United States Olympic Team. Last .

weekend, the Pitt junior tlnlshedsecond to willie Gault in thq
