Bomb threat
empties .
Cathedral

By Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Police evacuated the Cathedral of
Learning Monday morning after
receiving the second bomb threat
in a week. , _
Alarms went off at 10:33 a.m.,-
and an announcement came over
loudspeakers instructed every-
one in the building to evacuate.
The building reopened at 12:31
p.m.. ‘
* Confusion set in as hundreds
of students, faculty and employ-
ees ﬁled out of the building. The

Emergency Notiﬁcation Service '

alert, sent at 10:36 a.m., arrived
to most in the crowd ten minutes
after the alarms sounded.

The alert said that a general
bomb threat had been received,
but did not specify a location or

time. Pitt police declined to com-

ment at the scene and directed
The Pitt News to media relations.
Spokesman john Fedele said that
outside of the Pitt ENS alert, he
had no other information.

Pitt police ordered people to
ﬁle across the street and away
from the building, but the mes-

sage went unheede,d,...,Many stu~ 

dents continued walking on the
Cathedral sidewalk next to Big-
elow Boulevard, and some stood
on the building’s patio.

This is thesecond bomb threat
against the Cathedral in the past
six days. Sophomore Melissa,De—
lia said she got evacuated from
the "same 11 a.m. class as the last
bomb threat on Wednesday.

Alice Haas has a problem. She

at Pitt because she is a trans-
gender student. And she is not
alone. , . , '

“It should be none of the Uni-
versity’s business what there is
_in between my legs,” Haas, a ju-
nior, said.

The issue, stems from the

desire of University ofﬁcials,.

who have no written policy, not

does not know where to shower

to discriminate against trans-
gender individuals, while still
respecting others who use the
showers. Students said this lack
of a policy creates confusion as
to which facilities can be used by
whom because the University’s
policy currently provides for
two different guidelines based
on whether or not the shower
facilities in question are open or
private.

The existing policy

Jane Feuer, chairperson of

 

Pitt’s Anti—Discriminatory Poli-
cies Committee —l a standing
committee in the University
Senate — said that currently,
cases regarding the use of Uni-
versity bathrooms by transgen-
der persons are addressed at an
individual level. '

SGB member Julie Hallinan
said that she and Tricia Dough-
erty, the president of Rainbow
Alliance, are the only two stu-
dents who sit on the ADP com-
mittee, but they do not have vot-
ing powers.

“[Cases] tend to be taken on

‘Transgender shower policies a source of confusion

a case—by—case individual [ba-
sis]. The question is, ‘What is
gender identity and expression?
What does that mean?’ We need
to look at what’s being done na-
tionally,” Feuer said.

Robert Hill, vice chancellor
for public affairs, said in a state-
ment, “We work closely with any
student who has a special hous-
ing request and try to address
individual needs on a case—by-
case basis, and our plan is to
continue to do so.”

Showers >.2

SHOWERS

FROM PAGE 1

On Feb. 21, the ADP commit-
tee discussed the use of gender-
speciﬁc restroom facilities on
campus, as well as gender in re-
lation to housing, health insur-

ance and restroom and changing

facilities.

Feuer said Pitt currently has
an unwritten policy regarding
bathroom use. In open showering
facilities, such as a locker room,
individuals must shower in ac-
cordance to their natal sex. But in
private facilities, such as apart-
ment-style residencies, they may
shower in the facility of the gen-
der with which they identify. -

The voting members of the
committee unanimously passed a
resolution in order to “clarify the
policy by stating that it should
operate according to the sex with
which the person identiﬁes now,
not the natal sex. We also asked
that this policy apply to regional
campuses,” Feuer said.

While the committee passed
the resolution, Feuer said that
some members of the admin-

istration, whom she would not
name, told_ her that allowing

transgender individuals to use-

public showers not of their natal
sex was “too radical” for Pitt.

Hallinan disagreed with the
University’s assessment. '

“The fact that the Univer-
sity said, ‘You’re too radical’ was
heartbreaking  that you don’t
have a place here — to trans-
gendered individuals, to any
students. It’s terrible,” Hallinan
said. ,

Feuer said there is still a wide-

ly shared opinion “that Pitt was .

not ready to allow for transgen-
der persons to use the shower of
their chosen sex in cases of public
showers.” Public showers include
open facilities, such. as those
found in locker rooms or gymna-
siums.

Vice Provost Patricia Beeson
informed the committee that this

.policy applied to the regional

campuses as well.

Feuer elaborated on the dis-
tinction between open, public
showers, which don’t have doors
or curtain rods, compared to pri-
vate and public non-open areas.

“Many feel that public show-
ering is a different situation from
restrooms with private stalls. I
think our committee was sug-
gesting that perhaps it is not so
different. We know that in the
past, racial discrimination often
took the form of segregated fa-
cilities. It’s a very difﬁculf issue,”
she said. “The transgendered
community supports the chosen
sex, which goes against old ways
of thinking about sexuality.”

She. said it’s important to
consider the feelings of natal
sex individuals, who may not be
comfortable in an open—shower
environment.

“It’s very hard to accept

changes in your way of thinking,”

Feuer said.

The ADP has worked for two
years to determine the best appli-
cation of the University’s nondis-
crimination policy to transgender
members of the Pitt community.
The nondiscrimination policy
forbids discrimination on the ba-
sis of “sexual orientation, gender
identity and expression,” a clause

added in 2008..
Currently, Pitt’s housingpolicy

‘does not allow for coed and gen-

der-neutral room assignments,
even as colleges across the coun-
try, including Pitt’s neighbor Car-
negie Mellon, have changed their
policies to allow students the op-
tion of picking their roommates
regardless of sex. -

' Discussion at Pitt

Discussions regarding policies
relevant to transgender individu-
als are not new to the committee;
members have voiced concerns
numerous times as they deliber-

ated possible policies over the '

past year. -

“A lot of people from all seg-.

ments of the University — facul-
ty and students — [have] a feel-
ing that there should be more of
a policy so there would be proce-
dures, rather than a case-by-case
basis,” Feuer said.

The committee agreed to peti-
tion the University Senate toes-
tablish a University-wide ad hoc
committee, which would report
back to _the ADP -for potential
further action regarding more
complicated issues, including
housing, health insurance and
facilities. T

The A committee would initiate
an investigation of the policy, ex-
amining how such matters relate
to the transgender community.
The resolution would be passed

to the faculty after the ad hoc :.

committee submits‘ its report.

Hallinan and Feuer both com-
mented on recent changes, say-
ing that the University hasbegun
plans to build new facilities with
gender-neutral policies in mind,
though it hasn’t determined spe-
ciﬁc changes.

Feuer and Dougherty both said
intolerant people could make it
uncomfortable or even danger-
ous for transgender individuals
to enter genderedlrestrooms.

“That’s the problem. There
will be these incidents when a
person will try to evict a [trans-
gender individual]. That’s not
a practice supported here, but
most people don’t know tha ,”
‘Feuer said.

Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Affirmative Action,
Diversity and Inclusion, which
implements these policies, de-

A statue ol'Robcr1.o Clemente stantls outside PNC Park

clined to comment on the issue.

Currently, transgender stu-
dents at Pitt can use the restroom
of their gender identity and be
fully protected by the nondis-
crimination policy as long as they
have a note from their physician,
Haas and Hallinan said. .

“These are baby steps,” Hal-
linan said. “It’s the ﬁrst step into
accepting ' transgendered stu-
dents as any other students.”

Hallinan and Dougherty both
attended the ADP meeting inFeb-
ruary. ' ' .

“Somewhere along the way,
people forgot that we are talking
about actual students who need
tangible things so that they can
thrive here at Pitt,” Dougherty
said in an email, which also men-

a

tioned the lack of a transgender
housing policy at Pitt‘.

“I’m hopeful that with con-
stant education and communica-
tion, especially with administra-
tion, the changes that need to
be made and have thus far been
ignored will eventually be made.

' The question is really how many

more Pitt students will be forced
to live in an unsupported, unsafe
environment before the neces-
sary change happens.”

Hallinan agreed, but ended on
a hopeful note. ‘

“It makes me optimistic that
in the future, we can assimilate
transgendered showers into
housing,” she said. “This is going

to keep coming up, and we’re not ‘

going to let it go.” I

Eﬁi'l"€)REAL THE $€7:§iAFF£3A\.i§T

Romney’s comment about
young voters unfounded

GOP presidential candidate
Mitt Romney doesn’t under-
stand why young people would
vote-Democrat.

Yes, you read that right. Ac-
cording to The Huffington Post,
Romney said on Sunday after
his Puerto Rico primary victory,
“I don’t see how anyone who is
a young person could vote for a

Democrat, I’m going to be hon- .

est with you.”

We’re going to be honest
with you; this guy is so out of
touch that he probably doesn’t
see why anyone would buy a
watch that isn’t a Rolex.

Although statistics show
that he’s garnered some sup-
port from the 17—to-29 age
range in states such as Arizona
and Alabama, we don’t see what
he’s trying to do with this blan-
ket statement.

In fact, it kind of terriﬁes us.

Emphasizing that he doesn’t
see how the Democratic party
could appeal to young people
isn’t just absurd, unfounded
nonsense — it also shows a
complete lack of respect for bi-
partisanship.

Having at least two ideolo-
gies is fundamental to society,
and Romney’s catch-all com-
ment shows his misunderstand-
ing of not only young voters,
but of the foundations of politi-
cal thought.

Romney has proven before
that he’s not exactly a relat-
able guy. But this statement just
makes him look even more out
of touch than before. _

(And before you call us a
bunch of liberal-leaning Com-
munists, we kindly remind you
that our editorial board is com-
prised of many different po-
litical ideologies ——- some more
conservative than you might
think.) .

Romney really doesn’t see
why young people wouldrvote

Democratic? Democratic beliefs
and policies are much more ap-
pealing to us. Let us count the

 

EWS.BOM PITTNEWSCU

. ways.

Most young people are in
favor of same-sex ‘marriage,
unlike Romney. According to a
Pew Research Center study, 65
percent of the college freshmen
surveyed in 2009 supported
same-sex marriage. In addi-
tion, 58 percent of Americans
18 to 29 years old supported it,
compared to 39 percent of the
nationwide population.

Young people also think very I

differently from the GOP when

it comes to women’s rights.)

NARAL Pro-Choice America
found that 61 percent of young
people were “pro—choice,” as
they supported legal abortion
in all or most cases.

They also heavily lauded
President Barack Obama’s
birth control mandate, mostly
because it addresses women’s
needs in a time where women
are still ﬁghting for their repro-
ductive rights.

In addition, public ameni-
ties like public transportation,
higher education and social pro-

grams are all things that appeal V l

to young people. GOP members
are in favor of cutting them.

Sure, Obama hasn’t lived up
to expectations. But compared
to the circus that is the current
state of the GOP, we certainly
have reason to believe that
young people will maintain their
stances'on the issues above.

Above all, we must remem-
ber that these are politicians
who might — like Romney
-— say whatever it takes to get
votes, even if they don’t believe
what they’re saying.‘ ‘

Young people must be able
to look past politics in favor of
understanding policy.

After all, we identify most
with those who support what
we believe in —— who doesn’t?
Romney can’t change the way
people operate with a blanket
statement, even if his candidacy
depends on it. E

 

Corbett uses ‘Peekaboo strategy’

  

By Matthew Schaff
' Columnist

People everywhere go about life with the notion
that human history has exhausted its possible sup-
ply of brilliant, transformational political think-
ers. These average people occupy coffee shops and
workplaces wearing forlorn faces, thinking, “Well,
having already seen the heavyweights like Plato,
Machiavelli and Locke, what extra insight could
we expect_ from our species? Other than black
suits, voluminous egos and top-notch entertain-
ment, our current political system couldn’t, at least
within a reasonable spectrum of the imagination,
squeeze out anything of substance to contribute to
mankind’s political intellectual legacy.”

All this talk of mediocre outlooks, while perhaps
valid in the recent past, has now been irrefutably
rendered unnecessary; we can safely reroute our
sighs of disappointment back to the media’s end-
less skewering of Britney Spears (they just won’t
leave her alone). That’s because, in our midst, a po-
litical mind has emerged who shines with every bit
of promise that the greats must have held in their
time. His name is Tom Corbett, the sitting governor
of Pennsylvania, and he secured his eternal seat in
the hallowed hall of historical signiﬁcance just last
week.

Gov. Corbett unleashed the brilliance last week
in his commentary on Pennsylvania’s ongoing
abortion-ultrasound "controversy. The state legis-
lature is currently considering a bill, the Women’s
Right to Know Act, that would force any Pennsylva-

[allj1I§;lUH,urcl\r<‘*-.\iH\‘. mm x urlwll lnokalittle nefarious?

when dealing with problems

nia woman seeking an abortion to ﬁrst undergo an
ultrasound procedure. The obligatory procedure
would determine the health and gestational age of
the fetus, produce fetal images that would be pro-
vided to the patient on a screen above her face and
in physical form, and require signed paperwork to
be carried by the patient to her abortion doctor after

a minimum of 24 hours. Citing a litany of concerns.’

ranging from constitutionality to basic decency,
opposition to the bill has gained steam — that is,
the steam was gaining until Corbett took the stage.
Uttering a phrase destined for inscription beneath
the governor’s future bronze bust in the state capi-
tol, he squelched charges of government overreach,
declaring, “I’m not making anybody watch, OK? Be-
cause you just have to close your eyes.”

Wow. Like no one before him, exhibiting ex-
traordinary mental ﬁnesse, Gov. Corbett has man-
aged to recreate an infant’s lack of object perma-
nence within his own mind so as to extract and
reframe the key lesson from the game of Peekaboo:
If we close our eyes, all the problems in the world
— especially those intentionally made by pander-
ing politicians —- can disappear.

Corbett’s thesis is excessively simple, yet excep-
tionally elegant. Surely, as experts have warned,
the ultrasound bill’s neglecting to specify a re-
quired ultrasound method could likely force prac-
titioners to widely apply the invasive transvaginal
wand (you can’t accurately image a ﬁrst-trimester
fetus with “jelly on the belly”), and such a situation
could open a dark, morally dubious chapter in the

history of the commonwealth. But those
worries are for naught, points out Corbett.
When everyone involved — the policymak-
ers, the enforcers and the citizens —— col-
lectively pull down their eyelids, there isn’t
anything reprehensible the state can’t do.
To expound further, negative effects of our
actions cannot be felt if we aggressively re-
fuse to perceive those effects. Although, of
course, given the ultrasound wand’s desti-
nation, you’d probably have to add general
anesthesia to eye-closure to allow affected

women to ‘completely block out thoughts
(and internal sensations) of government
intrusion, his point still stands. _
The utility of the “Peekaboo strategy”
doesn’t stop at abortions. Outside of aid-
ing Republicans’ campaign to dismantle,

er, redeﬁne women’s rights, Corbett’s_

groundbreaking insight offers huge po-
tential for the pitching of nearly the entire
GOP brand. Truthfully, it seems many Re-
publicans in power have been inspired by
it all along. (Perhaps that means Corbett
is the darkhorse Romney—alternative ev-
eryone’s waiting for the RNC to unveil.)
What other than coordinated, systematic
eye-closing can explain how half a na-
tion indefatigably terms the Iraq inva-

ldllntlallbllclu

sion as anti-terrorism, doubts President
Barack Obama’s citizenship, blames him
for rising oil prices, spurns the need for
tax increases in addressing national debt,

‘spits on the science of evolution, vows to

protect Americans from socialized medi-
cine (despite the popularity of Medicare),
thinks gay weddings assault the institu-
tion of marriage more than congressional
extramarital affairs, accepts the “job cre-
ator” argument as anything more than the
wealthy’s defense of the widening U.S. in-
come gap and votes regularly outside per-
sonal, social or economic interest? V
The applications and implications of
Gov. Corbett’s thesis far outpace any mor-
tal’s list-making abilities, and this “Peeka—

5

boo strategy” is sure to attract decades of
critique by academics at the most presti-
gious institutions. Our governor has prov-
en a political genius of modern times, and
with his so being I cannot wait to see what
this man does next, even if that entails
deepening his much-maligned cuts to edu-
cation programs. Don’t think too hard: If
we close our eyes, we don’t have to see the
young Pennsylvanians — and by extension,
our future commonwealth and country —
being shut out of a brighter tomorrow. I

Speciﬁcally, they’re not in-

generations have been. Though
members of this generation con-
tinually take up causes to change
the world, it’s still missing one
crucial factor in affecting politics:
voting. Consequently, politicians
often pass it by. '

she feels she should be more in-
volved. Bluntly stated, voting
feels “pointless.” l

“I do not think we’re apathetic
when it comes to our communi-
ties and when it comes to what
we want to gain in our lives,”
Garvey said about students. _“But
I deﬁnitely think we’re apathetic
toward the voting process.”

The diﬁerence between young
and old .

Garvey’s mindset is‘ increas-
ingly the norm among potential
young voters, said’Russell Dal-
ton, a professor of political sci-

- ence at the Universityof Califor-

nia, Irvine. 8'

V “Young people are typically
less politically engaged‘ [than
adults] because they are busy
with school, ﬁnding a partner,
getting a job and so forth,” Dalton
said in an email. . '

Dalton explained that there are
some crucial differences in how
the youth view politics compared
to their parents’ generation. For
example, he said that young peo-
ple are more likely to criticize all
politicians rather than vote based
on a party alliance.

Pitt sociology professorjackie
Smith said that this ﬁts in with

what many view as a problem ‘

with the current polarized two-
party system, where difﬁculty
compromising on important is-
sues makes policy difﬁcult. Addi-
tionally, the recent rise» in corpo-
rate and lobbyist power has also

;.9ms-z~.:;-_v.4-- .2:-an .‘m:-n:x.u=v4....a..a.-..;~a mg-.....;-¥.

resulted in politicians focusing
more on the people funding
their campaigns and less on the
American people, she said.

“To run for oﬂice and have
an impact on voting, politicians
have to appeal to corporate in-
terests, and that further nar-
rows the options and discus-
sion,” Smith said. “If people
don’t hear things of interest to
them being discussed, they’re
less likely to participate in poli-
tics.” This creates disconnect
among all voters, especially
students. .

This often means less stu-

dent representation at the

polls. _. ,
In 2000, the youth-voter

turnout -— ages 18 to 24 — ,

reached 36 percent. In the
2004 and 2008 elections, the
numbers for that group spiked
to 47 and 51 percent, respec-
tively, according to“ Center for
Information 8; Research on Civ-
ic Learning and Engagement, a
nonproﬁt civic action research
group. But participation fell in
2010 to 20.9 percent.

That falls well short of the
voter turnout of the general
population as well. In 2000, 51
percent of Americans over 18
voted; in 2004 it was 55 per-
cent, according to the American 8

Presidency Project, an online ,

database from the University
of California, Santa Barbara. In
the highest youth turnout year,
2008, 55 percent of the eligible’
population voted, according to
the database. ‘ a
While Dalton believes that
students should vote and be in-
volved in"choosing the leaders
that shape America’s policies,
he’s not surprised by the low
youth-voter turnouts. V
“Rather than just asign of
disinterest, it may also be a sign
that young people are turned
off by the nature of partisan
politics,” Dalton said. “Watch—
ing Washington these days, this

seems like a realistic perspec-

tive rather than apathy.”

The changing climate for *

student involvement

Government, policy and cam-
paign tactics these days are far
different from politics of the past.

-Smith said that several factors

over time‘ have created a culture
that largely discourages youth
involvement in politics. While

cal involvement, Smith said that
it’s pointless to compare now to
then.
“The system is very different
in the range of political discus-
sion,” Smith said. For starters,
‘few politicians speak to students
directly about issues, making
the youth less inclined to feel in-
volved in politics or to vote, she
said.
Despite these factors and

the mixed responses to politics-

among college students, Oakland
is usually rife with people asking
students to register to vote in the
fall. Additionally, student groups
such as the Pitt College Demo-
crats and Pitt College Republi-
cans are ﬁlled with students who
consider it their civic duty to vote
and even campaign for the'politi—
cians they support.

Smith considers it “normal for
students in this age group to not

be thinking about the larger so-

ciety” and to grow more involved
in the process later in life.

But there’s undoubtedly po-
litical involvement at Pitt. Aside
from the booths and fundraisers
directed toward social causes, se-
nior Richard Hill, public relations

director for the Pitt College Re— I
' publicans, noted that more stu-

dents have attended the group’s
meetings since the GOP debates

A nice house in Bikini Bottom needs a

well-kept lawn. Despite the silly Sponge-
Bob SquarePants reference, the issue of
keeping a well—kept lawn, or landscaping,
reemerges every summer. For those who
have hair removal on their agenda, waxing

is a process one should seriously consider.

These days, it seems we only value the
hair on our heads — everything else can
go. Luckily, the Mayo Clinic approves of
at least one method: Waxing is a safe and
effective method for hair removal. While
this procedure seems scary and painful,
according to ESSpa Kozmetika owner_Eva
Sztupka-Kerschbaumer, a professional
wax isn’t more than a ﬁve on a pain rating
scale from one to ten.

The waxing procedure is simple. Treat
skin with a mild cleanser, then sprinkle
with baby powder to keep the area dry. Ap-
ply hot wax in the direction of hair growth
before placing a cloth strip on top of the

wax — if using hard wax, a cloth strip

is unnecessary. Hold the skin taut, then
quickly pull the strip in the opposite direc-
tion of hair growth.

When it comes to waxing any part of
the body, let the hair grow out to at least
a quarter to half of an inch long. This way,

you can ensure the wax will stick to the
hair — not to the skin.

In comparison to shaving, waxing offers
more beneﬁts. According to Livestrong.
com, hair grows back thinner and softer
after waxing because the strands are com-
pletely removed from the follicle. If there
is no shaving in between waxing sessions,
this hair removal technique leaves skin
feeling smooth for weeks.

If you’re going in for your ﬁrst wax, tell

your technician. “The worst thing a client
can be is nervous. If you’re more comfort-
able, it makes the wax easier and faster,”
Sztupka—Kerschbaumer said.
I Note that waxes work differently with
all kinds of skin types. Certain waxes inw’
clude honey wax, cream wax, and even a
chocolate wax. Try out afew to determine
your preference and what works best for
your body. ,

Finding the right wax isn’t the step be-
fore gaininga pristine, hairless body. Irri-
tating aspects, likeingrown hairs — when
the tip of the hair folds back and begins
to grow away from the follicle opening -
can override the smooth beneﬁts of a wax.
The best way to prevent. ingrown hairs is
by exfoliating two or three days after your
appointment. A simple sugar scrub helps
strands break through the surface of the

skin, preventing ingrown hair. It’s also
important to avoid heavily scented lotions
and body creams because the skin is more
sensitive.

The added sensitivity also means one
should avoid major exercise and sunlight.
“A lot of brides come in right before their
honeymoon and go and lay on the beach.
Your skin is going to try and protect you,
so you couldbe more prone to things like
dark spots, that kind of thing. It’s better to
wait a little bit,” Sztupka—Kerschbaumer
said. .

To cope with the sting, some people use

painkillers. But many medications like Ty-

lenol or Advil are blood thinners, making it 7

more likely that you will bleed during your
wax. “Waxing doesn’t take that long, it’s
better to just kind of suck it up? I do not
recommend painkillers,” Sztupka—Kersch—
baumer said.

Waxing may be more painful than other I
' beautylremedies, but there are plenty of

people who stand by it. Undergraduate
student Samantha Wagner insists on it.

“I love that I don’t have to worry about
shaving on a regular basis. My skin stays

smoother longer. That little bit of pain is

deﬁnitely worth it,” she said.
So why not try it? All you have to lose
is hair.

began. He believes the larger turnouts
demonstrate an interest in current issues.

“I think there’s actually a political cul-
ture at Pitt, but it doesn’t translate into
numbers,” Hill said. “I also think social
causes are very visible on campus‘. So while
[student] political groups just table, there
are social causes who do outreach more
often and who do special projects. I think
those are more visible than political par-
ties.”

Lara Sullivan, president of the Pitt
College Democrats, agreed, stating in an
email that while there will always be some
apathetic students, many do get involved
somehow.

A “I believe that students express their
views on politics and the country by other
means than simply voting: by participating
in clubs involving social movements im-
portant to them, volunteering in the com-
munity and even participating in demon—
strations and protests,’.’ she said.

And considering how politics works,
this disinterest in voting is not that sur-
prising, according to Matthew DiFiore, a

past Pitt College Democrats president who

graduated in December.

“Voting is no guarantee that the actions
that you want done will get done, since the
entire government is made from checks
and balances,” he said. “From social move-
ment perspectives, it’s much more effec-
tive to use grassroots efforts and protests
to demand change.”

Where are the young voters?

For many students, efforts toward
change come in the form of tackling spe-
ciﬁc issues. Freshman Gabrielle Joyce is
currently involved in Pitt’s chapter of Feel-
Good where she educates others about
poverty and hunger issues. She said she
feels as if she’s raising awareness in away
that could potentially make a positive im-
pact on the issue. Still, she feels discon-

nected from politics.

“If politics was like that, where peo-
ple went out and ﬁxed or created things,
maybe I’d be more active,” she said. “But
politics are inﬂexible in a world where you
need to be ﬂexible.” ‘

This is a catch-22 that students ac-
knowledge: If students don’t vote, politi-
cians will continue to consider them to be
apathetic and won’t address them.

Voter turnout for most age groups is
rarely “high,” but there’s a major differ-
ence between how generations engage
in politics. Those who use the Internet as
part of their lives — particularly students
—— are able to respond through these plat-
forms, Dalton said. He said this presents
an opportunity for young people to change
politics by forcing politicians to acknowl-
edge them in ways they,didn’t have to pre-
viously. .

"For example, now students can make
their voices heard through Internet pe-

titions, which allow citizens to weigh in 4

without sending a letter, making a phone
call or marching in Washington.

But students seem to prefer these meth-
ods over voting. Students like Sullivan and
Hill work with their groups to get students
like Garvey andjoyce to vote.

“Voting is the simplest form of express-
ing one’s opinion of ‘the current state of
politics,’’ she said. “I believe that many
people, especially young people, do not
vote because they simply do not feel in-
formed enough about the issues to make a
decision on candidates.”

To help inform their classmates, po-
litical student groups table around campus
and hold screenings, debates and discus-
sions about political candidates more often
during elections." They aim to encourage
their classmates to vote and offer resourc-
es to help students feel less overwhelmed
by the political process.

Students like Joyce, though, still don’t
plan on voting this year.

“I think a lot of my friends and I, as
freshmen, don’t feel that inclined to get in-
volved,” she said. ‘‘We’re still worried about
picking majors more than anything.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Five Panthers ﬁnished with double-
digit point totals during Monday
night’s win against Princeton.

The men’s basketball team de-
feated the Tigers 82-61 at the Pe-
tersen Events Center during the
quarterﬁnals of the College Bas-
ketball Invitational. ‘

Lamar Patterson led the Pan-
thers with 19 points, and Nasir
Robinson added a double-double
with 12 points and 10 rebounds to
propel Pitt (19-16) intothe semiﬁ-
nals of the CBI.

But the improved performances
came too little, too late. Starting
point guard Travon Woodall said
after the game that the team, with
nothing on the line, is playingloose
at this point in the season.

“We’re just out there playing
basketball. Coach [Jamie] Dixon
told us just to go out there and just
play hard, make the extra pass and
have fun,” Woodall said. “You see
a lot of guys out there smiling a lot
more.”

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said after the game, “I’m not going
to tell you it’s what we want to be
doing. We want to be in the NCAA
Tournament  but these guys want
to play — from everything they’ve
done in practice, being there early,
and the way they’ve come out _in
both games.”

Patterson’s 19 points made for
a career high.

“The ﬁrst couple shots went in.
I just kept testing it, and it just kept
falling,” he said after the game. “My

      SPORTS

Meow! Panthers win battle of cats, dominate Tigers

guys tell me to shoot open shots,
and .that’s what I was doing.”

Princeton’s (20-12) run in the
CBI ends after the team allowed 168
points in two postseason games.

Woodall ﬁnished two rebounds
short of a triple-double for Pitt. He
had 15 points, 11 assists and eight
rebounds.

“I’m not going to lie..Before I

subbed out, they told me I was four '

rebounds away. That’s why you saw
me running after the rebounds,”
Woodall said after the game, laugh-
ing. “But besides that, I was just in
the ﬂow of the game.”

Talib Zanna’ had 11 points with
six rebounds, and Ashton Gibbs
also scored 10 points for Pitt.

The Panthers are 23-of-45 from
3-point range in the CBI.

Pitt’s offense had little trouble
running its sets against the Princ-
eton defense. The Panthers scored
49 ﬁrst—half points and showed
promise even with se_niors Gibbs

and Robinson on the bench. Thir-

ty-nine of Pitt’s ﬁrst—half points
Monday came from players who
will return next fall.

“This is a very good team, and
we played well and went out and
did the things we wanted to do. It’s
hard to be up on Princeton by 24
points in the ﬁrsthalf,” Dixon said
after the game.

Monday was Pitt’s highest-
scoring ﬁrst half since the team’s
57-point performance against Vir-
ginia Military on Dec. 6.

“We’ve been trying to simulate
game situations in practice,” Wood-
all said. “Guys have been going re-
ally hard  it’s deﬁnitely helping us,
carrying over into the game.”

Princeton shot well in spurts
in the ﬁrst half, especially -from

3-point range.]unior forward Mack '

Darrow and senior guard Douglas

Davis combined for six ﬁrst-half I —

3-pointers.

Davis led Princeton with 20
points, passing Kit Mueller to be-
come Princeton’s No. 2 scorer all-
time. ,

But Pitt ﬁnished the ﬁrst half
with just one turnover and a 49-
25 lead.

After intermission, Princeton
came within 11 points of the Pan-
thers thanks tojstrong shooting
from Davis and junior forward Ian
Hummer, but Pitt shot 48.3 percent
from the ﬁeld down the stretch to
close out the win.

“It’s hard to come back and
win,” Princeton head coach Mitch
Henderson said after the game, re-
ferring to the hole the Tigers dug
themselves into early.

Hummer ﬁnished with 14 points '

and nine rebounds. He said his
team “focused on getting the ball
inside” on Pitt late in the game but
lamented the timing, saying that
the Tigers “should have done it in
the ﬁrst hal .” . .

Pitt dominated the boards and
the paint Monday night. The Ti-
gers had just ﬁve offensive rebounds
and no second—chance points, and
the Panthers won the rebounding
battle, 39-26. ‘

“We didn’t do a good enough
job this year getting the ball inside,
and it’s been an emphasis this last
couple of games,”,Dixon said. “Post-
ups, penetration  it’s something
that we should have done better
earlier in the year.” I

GRAIN OF SAUL

Peyton Manning chooses Broncos, potenti

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

See you later, Tim Tebow,‘ the
Denver Broncos just found their
new starting quarterback.

After nearly two weeks of
negotiations, visits, speculation,
workouts, physicals and rumors,
Peyton Manning decided to stay
loyal to the horses, but swapped
the Colts for the Broncos.

The move leaves a ripple effect
that will be felt throughout the
NFL. Manning, who is the most
valued free agent since the free
agency era began in 1993, brings
Hall of Fame talent and Super
Bowl experience to a team that
made it to the playoffs (and won
a game) with an underdeveloped
fullback under center last
season. i o

-Even though Tebowmania ran
wild in 2011, Broncos head coach

John Fox and owner john Elway’s
decision to bring in Manning
speaks volumes about Manning’s
ability, as. well as Tebow’s
inability. A A ' I

This story is just as much
about the certain exit of Tebow as
it is about the entrance of one of
the NFL’s greats.

On the ﬁeld, Tebow and
Manning are pretty much polar
opposites. ' ‘ .

Tebow is a bruiser, stron

with his legs and inaccurate with

his arm. Manning is the opposite, '

about as immobile as they come,
but with throwing accuracy
frightening enough to make a

-sniper proud. .

Last season, the Broncos had
to limit theirplaybook to keep
Tebow comfortable. They ran
options and quarterback keepers,
simple routes and looked for
the big play. Manning’ probably
knows more about the Denver

ally leaving Tebow out in the cold

playbook than coach Fox, and he’s
only been there for a few hours.

Manning is respected, his ‘-

talents unquestioned. Tebow is
speculated upon, his abilities
always in question. Manning
brings age and experience. Tebow
brings youth and excitement.

Manning was born in Louisiana 

to a family of football players.
Tebow was born in the Philippines

MANNING

FROM PAGE ll

to a pair of Baptist missionaries.

Two different players, two different
styles, two different stories and one
obvious decision: Peyton'Manning.

The reaction from Denver will be
interesting. This is a town that put up
billboards to have Tebow brought in as
the starting quarterback. Jersey and ticket
sales skyrocketed when he stepped on

the ﬁeld. His late—gam.e magic was always ’

doubted, but somehow got him through
the ﬁrst round of the playoffs. He was, in
a word, heroic. .

But common sense would say Manning
was the obvious choice. How could you
turn down a sure Hall of Famer? Manning
is notorious for having an unmatched
competitive drive. He is always in the
ﬁlm room the longest, always in the_gym
the latest, always working to outthink his
own coaches. And now, a year after a neck
injury sidelined him for all of last season,
he has something to prove. If I were on the
Broncos’ schedule this year, I wouldn’t be
looking forward to facing him.

In terms of the advantages for Manning, |

they’re pretty obvious.

Compared to the other two teams
courting him (San Francisco and
Tennessee), Denver has the most cap room.
Regardless of how good he is, Manning
will need someone to throw to in 2012. The
49ers’ wide receivers are above average at
best and Tennessee’s wide receivers are
—wait, who are its receivers again?

Denver gets 250 days of sunshine. In
San Francisco, Manning would have to face
his brother, New York Giants quarterback
Eli Manning, in the playoffs. From Denver,

_ MCI
Peyton l\/‘Ianning holds onto the Super Bowl. MVP l'l_'0pll_\’
after his only SllPr3l' Bowl \‘i«:lnr\‘.

111131

they could ﬁnally make their dream of

seeing each other in the Super Bowl come
true. Tennessee’s defense is soft as butter,
while Denver’s defense made Tebow look
like an above average quarterback.

Denver boasts a coach who is a ten—year
veteran. San Francisco has a new —— albeit
successful —— Harbaugh brother, while
Tennessee has a guy named Mike Munchak
coming off his ﬁrst season at the helm.

Elway won two Super Bowls in Denver,
one at 37 and the other at 38. Manning is
35. What do you think they talked -about
during contract negotiations?

Above all, Manning wants to get back to
the playoffs. What division is easier than
the AFC West? The Chargers are notorious
underachievers, the Raiders haven’t been
relevant since Destiny’s Child was at the
top of the billboards and the Chiefs are the
laughingstock of the division.

Despite that, I’ve still heard all the
questions and doubts about this being the
right ﬁt.

Manning will ﬁrst have to seduce,
Denver fans away from Tebow. Then, he’ll
have to ﬁx his neck, regain strength in his
throwing arm, ﬁnd someone to throw to,
learn a new system, ﬁnd a new number
(No. 18 is retired in Denver) and adjust to
the altitude at Mile High Stadium.

But we’re talking about Peyton Manning ‘
You remember, don’t you? A

He has a league—record four Most
-Valuable Player awards, he’s an 11—time
Pro Bowler,’ a Super Bowl Champion, has

11 4,000—yard passing seasons (including I

a record six straight), the fastest
quarterback to 50,000 passing yards,
the fastest to 4,000 completions and is
the Indianapolis Colts’ all-time leader in
passing yards (54,828) and touchdowns
(399). _

Any other questions? I

EOFTBALL

Pitt starts strong and finishesslow at James Madison

By R] Sepich
Columnist

In its ﬁnal preparation before Big East play
begins next weekend, the Pitt softball team
(14-8) enjoyed a fourth-straight weekend
with a winning record against stiff non-
conference foes, ﬁnishing 3-2 at the James
Madison Invitational.

Pitt 1, Fordham O ‘

Senior Kristen Cheesebrew’s solo home
run in the third inning was all the scoring the
Panthers needed to start the weekend with a
win against Fordham on Friday morning.

Freshman pitcher Savannah King domi-

nated in the pitching circle, improving, her
early season record to 10-4 as she allowed A
only three hits against the Fordham Rams, -

But the result of the defensive struggle
was in doubt until the ﬁnal out. A

Following a single and an error in the
seventh and ﬁnal inning, King was able to
pitch out of the jam by recording a ground
out and ﬂy out as Pitt claimed victory.

Pitt 8, George Washington 5

The Panthers showed their ability to win
offensive games, too, after prevailing in a
Friday afternoon showdown with George
Washington. '

Pitt’s other freshman pitcher, Alexa Lar-

kin, got the start, but she struggled early as '

the Colonials led 3-1 after the ﬁrst inning.
Larkin held George Washington off the
board in the second inning, and Pitt’s of-
fense followed with four runs in the third
and another in the fourth to stretch out to

v a seemingly comfortable 6-3 lead.

Larkiri gave up two more runs in the ﬁfth,
narrowing the Panthers’ lead to 6-5, but a
home run from senior Keli Gaynor and two
scoreless innings by King ensured victory.

Fordham 5, Pitt 4'(11 innings)

Saturday’s games weren’t as kind to the
Panthers as Friday’s had been.

The day began with a tough extra-inning
loss to a Fordham team looking for revenge
after Pitt’s win Friday against the Rams.

King took the mound once again, but 1

this time Fordham grabbed the early lead,
thanks to a home run.

Down a run, Pitt rallied in the ﬁnal in- 0

ning with hits from seniors Niki Cognigni
and Yvette Bravo, putting the Panthers in
a position to win the game.'Cheesebrew’s

' single then scored Cognigni to tie the game

at 1-1, but Pitt couldn’t force the winning

run across as the tight battle went to extra -

innings.

The Rams ﬁnally made the decisive
breakthrough in the fourth extra inning by
tallying three runs. A Holly Stevens two-
run homer in the bottom half of the inning
gave Pitt hope, but it was not enough as the
Panthers dropped the lengthy contest.

James Madison 2, Pitt 1

The Panthers dropped another close,

game as two errors in the ﬁnal inning gift-

 

ed James Madison a 2-1 win on Saturday
afternoon. .

Larkin held the Dukes off the board un-
til the fourth inning, when James Madison
unconventionally stole home to grab the
lead. '

Thatlead only lasted an inning as fresh-
man Maggie Sevilla’s single scored senior
Ciera Damon to level the scores in a game
that seemed headed for extra innings. ’

But the Panthers’ defense unraveled in
the bottom of the seventh, as two errors
in quick succession allowed the Dukes to

snatch the 2-1 victory.

Pitt 9, George Washington 7

It took a massive comeback, but the Pan-
thers concluded the weekend with a 9-7 win
in another high-scoring affair with George
Washington ‘on Sunday morning.

A two-run home run from freshman Car-
issa Throckmorton gave Pitt the lead in the
top of the ﬁrst inning, but the Colonials came
back in the bottom half with seven runs off
King. It was the freshman hurler’s worst
outing of the season. .

Down ﬁve runs, the Panthers chipped

iTT PROJECT OAKLAND+

away at the lead with runs in each of the
next three innings before a‘Throckmorton

"75

single in the sixth scored Sevilla, giving Pitt ~

the lead at 8-7.
With relief, Larkin picked up her fourth
win‘ of the season, allowing only two hits

and striking out eight batters to let the Pitt '

offense complete its comeback.
