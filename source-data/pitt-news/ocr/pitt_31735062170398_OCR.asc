Fonda Speaks Out Againstlndachina War

by JIM RETHI

Appearing at a press confer-
ence Wednesday morning and
opening her two day tour of Pitts-

\ burgh. Jane Fonda lashed out at

the United States involvement in
Vietnam saying, “I think that if
the American people understood
what is being done in our names
while we’re being told peace is
coming. if they saw the faces of
the people of Vietnam who are be-
ing killed and wounded by bombs
paid for by our tax dollars, they
would do everything possible to
end the war immediately."

Fonda told what she saw dur-

. ing her visit to North Vietnam this
4 summer:

“Women whose bodies

' are riddled with steel pellets, chil-
dren whose feet and hands have
been blown off, napalm victims
twisted out of shape, looking like
they had been Hiroshima.“

Fonda was speaking as a mem-
ber of the Indochina Peace Cam-
paign (IPC), an organization at-
tempting to revitalize anti-war
-sentiment across‘ the United
States.

Through contacts with local or-
ganizations, distribution of edu-
cational materials such as films.
slides. and documents at a local
level, demonstrations, and a
speaking tour covering California,

-Qllinois. Michigan. Ohio, ‘Pennsyl-

vania. New Jersey, and New
York, the campaign hopes to per-
suade people to. voice their anti-

senator from Idaho, and one_of 21
senators and 50 -people speaking
Monday. Oct. 9, for presidential
candidate George McGovern in a
dramatic nationwide anti-war
speech.. will be at David Law-
rence Hall at noon.

The speech, similar to one giv-

en by McGovern the same day in-

New York City and Cleveland. will
attack Nixon’s Vietnam policies
on the anniversary of Nixon’s
statement four years ago: “Those
who have had a chance for four
years and could not produce peace
should not be given another
chancef’

Senator Church is co-author of
the famous Cooper-Church
amendment which barred funds
for United States’ Cambodian ac-
tivities after July 1, 1970, with-
out Congressional approval. That

endment was one of the few
anti-war votes to pass both

houses of Congress. According to .

the Congressional Quarterly, Sen-
ator Church “has been an early
and consistent critic of United
States involvement in Vietnam
and has repeatedly recommended
cuts in U.S. military spending.”

Sen. Church has also worked
hard to. cut off appropriations for
the SST and pushed for the repeal
of the “Formosa Resolution of
.1955, granting the right to involve

American forces in a conflict be-.

tween Nationalistand Communist
China. -

There will also be an open press

war feelings during this “critical”
period of a national election.

Tom Hayden, long time anti-
war activist and a member of the
IPC who attended the conference.
explained that the purpose of the
campaign is “to expose the de-
ceit that the war is winding down”
by educational and informational
means. .

He stated that “while Nixon is
telling the American public that
the war is nearing an end, more
planes, more bombs, more
shells are being employed in Viet-
nam than ever before.”

Hayden stated that was an ideal
time to attempt reactivization of
the anti-war movement for two
reasons: the failure of Nixon Viet-
namization program to turn the
war over to the Vietnamese: and
the valid alternative voters have
in George McGovern in the up-
coming election. -

Hayden claims that McGovern
“takes a view of the war which
we feel would actually end the
war.” While he indicated that-the
IPC is not campaigning for Mc-
Govern he said, “We welcome his
presence’ in the race because it in-
sures an anti-wardialogue even
at the Presidential level.”

Hayden. one of the Chicago Sev-
en defendants, related that the
campaign “is not just a tempor-
ary phenomenon,” and that the
group would continue its efforts
until the war is ended, regardless
of who is elected in November.

Another IPC member, George
Smith, a former Green Beret and
a POW for two years in North
Vietnam, spoke on the POW issue.
He said that he wanted to dispell
the idea that American prisoners

of war held" by North Vietnam and I

the NLF are “the worst treated
in history.” “I believe, in gen-
eral,” stated Smith, “that they
are all treated very well.”

Heclaimed that faculty logic is
involved in the Nixon administra-
tion’s strategy of staying in Viet-
nam to insure the return of the
POW’s: while forces are still
there, POW’s continue to be tak-
en. so the argument that we must
stay to insure their return is both
contradictory and self-perpetuat-
ing. '

Students who ‘applied for
PHEAA Loans and Scholarships
have found that their applications
were not processed in time to pay
the tuition bill.

- This year the Federal govern-
ment made significant changes in
the student ‘loan and scholarship
program. The new law altered the
conditions ‘under which the Fed-
eral government would provide
non-interest loans and scholar-

ships. One new requirement was
a statement of need, provided by
the University, to accompany
the certification of students eli-
gible for the program.

Agnes Lynch in the Office of
Student Aid explained the prob-
lem. “Under the old law we veri-

good standing. But, the Federal

Faculty for McGovern,
Organizes Support

“One of the trends in American society has been an anti-scientific
one. because of the feeling that science is used for killing . . . scientists
will vote for George McGovern not just because they are scientists.
but because they are people who can’t take the killing anymore." said
Professor of Physics Ed Gerjouy last Wednesday.

Gerjouy was one of ten faculty members. from all segments of the
University. and two students who spoke about the issues of the 1972
presidential campaign during a meeting sponsored by the Pitt Faculty
for McGovern held in the Public Health Auditorium.

The move to organize the McGovern supporters among the Pitt
faculty originated with Bob Marshall in the English Department, but
presently there are co-workers in every department of "the University.

“The problem.” according to Marshall. “is that faculty are gener-
ally anonymous within their own communities. but through the Univer-
sity we will be able to identify people who are willing to work for the
McGovern-Shriver campaign.”

A low-keyed academic atmosphere was retained during the short
statements by faculty members. which ranged from current foreign
policy to the economy. from pollsters’ inaccuracy to the welfare crisis.

Robert Newman, professor of Speach, spoke about the President’s
trip to China, and scathingly attacked “this spectacle-maker, who plays
Machiaveliam‘ power politics while talking about a generation of
peace,” noting that Nixon was “instrumental in formulating” the
American policy toward mainland China.

However, the new law never got
off the ground. Bureaucratic con-
fusion caused numerous delays as
instructions from the Federal
government to the State to the
University ricocheted. Finally. on
Aug. 19, the President proposed

James N. Beavers. Manager of

plained that his ‘department anti-_

cipated the long delay in early
August. He said, “As of Aug. 10
the State provided us with a list-
ing of all students who applied for

Those students were given tem-
porary credit until the State fin-
alized its analysis.

Each term each school sends a
list of courses open for cross-reg-

These courses are selected from
those regularly accredited to-
ward the‘baccalaureate program

ority in registering, however; is

fill out a form which is sent to

the student is notified directly
whether his application is approv-

Kolec advised. however, “If
they intend to count it towards

In the first two years of the
program Kolec noted that the ma-
jority of Pitt students attending
other institutions were taking craft
courses at Chathan and Carnegie-
Mellon, psychology and journal-
ism at Duquesne and physical
education courses at Point Park.

I enjoy quoting from this literature. The sub-

half of Ms. Coontz’ closing com-

most important thing you can do

on to urge people to vote on Nov.

for Linda Jenness and Andrew

for J enness and Pulley

Editor, The Pitt News:

For the first time since the 1944
presidential elections, the Amer-
ican people have a really mean-
ingful choice between candidates
for this high office. Almost all
the candidates since 1944, with
theexception of the present Dem-
ocratic candidate for that office,
have been basically as alike as
peas in a pod: all proclaimed their
devotion to peace, but most were
active war hawks and imperial-
ists.

The 1972 presidential campaign
between U.S. Senator McGovern
and President Nixon, however, of-
fers a choice which should be as
obvious to the informed as the dis-
tinction between light and dark-
ness; as between forthrightness
and deception; as between inter-
national cooperation and imper-
ialism. All people of good will who
want peace - and all of them
should—can achieve peace, I be-
lieve, after 27 disastrous years of

  

“Superior accuracy. The screening is conduct-
ed by TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) . . . su-
perior to conventional extraction techniques.”

“Rapid reporting . . . within 24 hours after re-
ceipt of the specimen. Positive findings will be re-
ported by telephone at no charge.”

“Economical system . . . can be as low as $2.26
. . .” all inclusive.

I’ll add a little more.

“Convenient, fast service for reliable detection
of: Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Methadone, Co-
deine, Cocaine, Morphine (heroin and other opi-
ates), Quinine.”

At thispoint, I became a little paranoid.

These people can detect whether you are on

. methadone maintenance, quinine for malaria, or

terpine hydrate and codeine for a cough. Thev seem’

unable to detect the effects of the deadly‘Cannibas,

but, according to an article published early this
year, the day is not far off.

This may not be enough to make the average
person truly paranoid. It has been known for some
time that drug-detection systems existed. Know-
ledge that the cost has been reduced to less than $3 '
may be food for thought. It is even cheaper in larger
batches. Twelve at a time: $2.26 each. Three at a
time: $2.76 each. Single specimens: $2.96 each.
“Per specimen price assumes the client takes ad-
vantage of the two percent in 15 day prompt pay-
ment discount.”

No mention is made of any responsibility on
the part of the “client” to inform his patient of the
purpose of the urine sample being taken.

And it is apparently a matter of conscience
whether the doctor notifies the authorities if he does
get a telephone report of a positive test. ‘

I am beginning to twitch uncontrollably.

fear, hate and neo-fascism, by
uniting in massive support of
George McGovern, a candidate
who generates light, forthright-
ness and cooperationf character-
istics which are the exact oppo-
site of those of his opponent.

It should now be clear to all-
and this applies especially to those
of us who have long worked for
peace-—that only the defeat of Mr.
Nixon can bring peace, or restore
the good name of the American
‘people. President Nixon has ex-

.panded the war to all of Indochina

in violation of his oath of office,
his campaign pledge to end it, and
common humanity. He has also
escalated the savagery of those
attacks upon the Indochines peo-
ple to a point never exceeded, and
rarely ifever equalled, in the an-
nals of warfare.

Above all else, however, Mr.
Nixon must be defeated in the
Presidential election, Nov. 7, re-
gardless of whether he ends the
war in Indochina now, if, when or
how he ends it. As Americans, we
must do this in order to purge
ourselves, partially at least, of
the crimes of this illegal, immor-
al and genocidal war of naked and
raw.aggression, which we as a
sovereign people have permit-
ted successive Washington admin-
istrations to impose upon a peo-
ple who have never threatened our
security in any way, and could not
do so even if they wished, which
they do not. Unless and until, as a
minimum, we remove from public
office all those primarily respon-
sible for these major crimes, the
decent people of the world can
never forgive us, nor should they.

Total irrelevance

by GEORGE znusr

A person can see all kinds of goings-on in the Commons Room. Like
the other week, when I was sitting there, staring into outer space.

“Eagleton? Howz come you’re wearin’ a McGovern-Eagleton but-
ton?” '

“Because, stupid, I’m voting for them 1*’

“Listen, pal, I’ll let you in on a little secret—Tom Eagleton was
canned a long time ago. "’

The conversation brought me back to earth. I looked around and
saw two guys sitting at a nearby: table, waving their hands and general-
ly causing a big stink. One fellow was balding and built like a gorilla;
the other guy was small and skinny, and wore the campaign button on
his railroad cap. The little guy spoke up.

“I know Eagletonwas canned-er, I mean, withdrew! But this dude
Shriver—he’s just bad forthe ticket.”

This exchange was going to be one-in-la-million.

“Whadda ya’ mean, ‘bad for the ticket’? He happens to come from
a very noble Maryland family.”

“Yeah, a little too noble. Do you know that his ancestors owned
slaves?” ‘

“Aw,” that’s just a bunch of Republican nonsense. Besides, it’s
totally irrelevant in 1972.”

“Oh, sure. And did you see howmuch Shriver’s wor-th?”

“No. Probably isn’t too much, is it?”

The little guy jumped up and used his finger to drive home his

point. In fact, he drove it right into the big guy’s nose. “Only a couple
hundred grand! And his old lady is worth about 500 G’s more than he is.”

_ The big guy slammed the Eagleton man _back into his seat. “Al-
right, already! But a lot of politicians have alot of, money. Besides. his
wife’s a Kennedy. I would hope she has some bucks.”

“You big goofball! Don’t you remember that Shriver said he was
going to stump for the labor and blue-collar vote? How's he gonna do
that if he’s a fat cat?”

The big guy rested his head on his right hand. After a few seconds
he grabbed for the little guy’s hat. “Gimme that Eagleton button!”

I went back to outer space.

Pitt Y Projects Offer  
Involvement Opportunities

By RALPH DEAN

Do you ever feel as though you’re just marking time here at
Pitt before you get on with your career and the rest of your life‘? If
so you are one of those who should be made aware of the Pitt YMCA
Volunteer Service Projects, whose programs for this year have just
gotten under way. These offer interested. moderately altruistic stud-
ent volunteers a chance to learn a good deal about others and
about themselves while performing worthwhile services in the com-
munity.

Among the most ambitious of these are the four programs op-
'erated with people in Mental Health Institutions. One of these,
Project Coffeehouse, helps mentally retarded adults operate their
own weekly social program in a setting that involves them with the
people of the community. This provides them with an opportunity to
develop social skills that they would not pick up in the usual insti-
tution. and which they need if they are to function outside that in-
stitution. Project chairwoman Ann Mooney says that there are pre-
_ sently seven volunteers involved, and that more are needed.

PROJECT WEST is establishdgto provide a source of social
contact for emotionlly disturbed children 6 to 16 years of age at
the Western State School and Hospital here in Oakland. According
to chairman Tim Hartman there are Cub and Boy Scouting pro-
grams involved, and the program is now operating every Wednes-
day night.

PROJECT ST. PETER’S is directed to helping pre-school age
children develop motor and perceptual skills, speech, socialization,
and self—care at St. Peters Child Development Center. When ef-
fective, this type of program helps to limit the number of instances
where -institutionalizing is the only choice available by helping
children to participate in normal family life. Volunteers spend at
least two hours weekly with sessions held from 9:00 to 2:00 Monday
through Friday. The project is coordinated by Pitt student Jackie
Nebely

Offering definite, valuable experience to those, students majoring
.(or just interested) in Psychology is PROJECT VETS, which is op-
erated in conjunction with and at the Leech Farm V.A. Hospital. In
this program volunteers participate in activities of a more technical
nature — group therapy, resocialization programs, and Behavior
Modification Programs. There are also opportunities for independent
study programs with the help of clinical and counseling psycholo-
gists at the hospital. Project Chairman is Pat Freund.

In these programs lies a great potential power for change in

the outlooks and institutions of the Medical Health Field. Accord?

ing to the YMCA’_s Director here at Pitt, Tom Huff, “There is a re-
volution going on in this field. Programs are becoming less institu-
tion oriented, rrioving instead towards community centers and ‘half-
way-houses.’ One of the reasons for this is volunteer action.”

In this election year, Demo-
crats will be searching for and
exploiting any traces of corrup-
tion within the Republican Par-
ty. This attempt to discredit the
party in power has resulted in
several embarrasing moments for
the Nixon Administration. Con-
tentions by the Democrats, such
as the government granting spe-
cial favors to ITT. have haunt-
ed the Republicans, and have
been the basis for condemna-
tions from the politicing Demo-
crats. This past week the Wash-
ington Post released a story
which will add another chapter
to the already large book of gov-
ernment scandals.

The Washington Post reports
that Nixon’s former attorney Gen-

‘eral, John Mitchell, controlled a

secret Republican fund in which
the money was used to_pay for
attempts at gathering informa-
tion about the Democrats.

The Post quoted what it term-
ed “reliable sources involved in
the Watergate investigation.”
These sources estimated the
fnnd’_s balance varied between
$350,000 and $700,000. It is re.-
ported by the Post that Mitch-
ell approved withdrawals from
the fund almost a year before‘he

.left the Justice Department. A
-spokesman for the Committee

for the Re-election of the Presi-
dent termed the stories untrue.
“Neither Mr. Mitchell nor Mr.
Stans (Nixon’s finance chairman)
have any knowledge of any dis-
bursement from an alleged fund
as described by the Post. And
neither of them controlled any
committee expenditures while
serving as government officials.”

Nixon Sidesteps ,‘Hot Potatoes’ g

Department earlier this year to
head up Nixon‘s re-election
campaign. Three months later.
on July 1, the former Cabinet

official resigned as Mr. Nixon’s,

campaign manager at the re-
quest of his wife, Martha.

With the new accusations dir-
ected at Mitchell. this election
year has now witnessed two pol-
itical controversies involving
Nixon’s ex-Cabinet heads. The
first being Maurice Stans, form-
er Secretary of Commerce, now
the finance chairman of Nixon’s
re-election committee.

Many opponents of the Nixon
administration have tied Maurice
Stans to the “Watergate Caper.”
This incident was where five
members of the Committee to
Re-elect the President were found
removing a “bug” placed earlier

in the Democratic National Head-.

quarters. Though Stans was not"
indicted by the Justice Depart-
ment’s grand jury investigation,
many people remain skeptical as
to the objectivity of the inquiry.
This skepticism is due in part
to the Justice Department’s af-
filiation with the Republican Par-
ty. (Mitchell was the head of
the Justice Department, then left
to become Nixon’s campaign
manager.)

  Deliver Us From “Deliverance'

by PAT O’BRIEN

"I think it may be true that for-
tune is the ruler of half our ac-
tions. but that she allows the
other half or thereabouts to be
governed by us. I would compare
her to an impetuous river that.
when turbulent inundates the
plains. casts down trees and build-
ings; everyone flees before it. and
everything yields to its fury with-
out being able to oppose it, and
yet though it is of such a kind.
still when it is quiet, men can
make ‘provision against it by dikes
and banks so that when it rises it
will either go into a canal or its
rush will not be so wild and dan-
gerousf‘

In short. Machiavelli . antici-
pated the Boy Scout motto and ad-
vised his prince to "Be Prepared"
noting, "Only those defenses are
good, certain and durable, which
dependon yourself alone and your
own ability." ’

James Dickey placed four over- _

aged Boy Scouts in canoes on the
turbulent Cahulawasse River and
asked if, when completely cut-off
from civilization, and confronted

lirwith a hostile environment, could

they depend on their own abilities,
could they deliver. His answer is

as old or older than Machiavelli,

“The strong do what they can, the
weak do what they must._” One
member of the party is murder-
ed, another is sodimized, the
third .is seriously injured, leaving
to the fourth the task of getting
himself and his two surviving
companions out of the wilderness
alive. ' -
Dicky’s notion of the way things
are may not be original, but his
social observations are sound. his
narrative talent is large, and his
prose occasionaly beautiful
Deliverance is a fine minor novel

-(Elf suspense and adventure which’

reads best late at night.
i Most of the damage done to the

screen version was done by
James Dicky himself when he
adapted his own work. He excised
both the preliminaries and the af-
termath, so we have no idea of
the actual relationship ‘between
these men. what they are individ-
ually, or -how their experience
changed them. All we have are
four guys coming out of nowhere
with canoes.

More important than that, most
of the book’s action occurs in the
mind of the first person narrator,
and consists of his planning the
steps he will take to save the par-
ty. Dicky is unable to render this
cerebration cinematically, so we
have action without drama. This
inability forces him to radically
alter his basic conception.

In the book the character is
perfectly capable of killing a deer.

'_ but simply miscalculates with his

bow and arrow. Later, he pre-
pares an ambush for three sus-
penseful pages as he mentally re-
views everything he ever knew
about archery, knowing he can
easily kill if only he has the talent
to deliver the shot.

In the movie he is reduced to
what the National-Rifle Associa-

tion Yahoos would call a Bambi-.

ist. who can’t kill a deer because
it looks cute like Bambi. and who
later will only shoot at a man
when that man is facing him with
a fully operational shotgun. In-
stead of an amateur archer. we
get a lucky clutz reminiscent of
Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs.
Deliverance through skill has be-
come deliverance by luck.

Although somewhat marred by

bleached photography, the film’s
best scenes are at the beginning

when the expedition members «

haggle details with local citizens.
Producer-director John Boorman
scouted the backwoods and as-
sembled a magnificent cast of ex-

tras. The “naturals” are superb,-

and one deformed banjo-playing
youngster is memorable. Unfor-
tunately, once the crew enters the

- water, we are with the profession-
als, and it is all down river from
there. Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox
are possible. Jon Voight is a good
actor in the hopelessly confused
role of Dustinﬂoffman. Burt Rey-
nolds is an actor for whom there
is no hope.

The book cost $1.25 in paper-
back; the movie will come to $3 at

boring poorly played film which
Edward L. Blank of the Pittsburgh
Press claimed, “Sets a new high
for movies in '72." Said Blank,
"It's incredible, but never incred-
ible." From such reviewer may
all find deliverance.

Popcorn Planting

-HARRISBURG (AP) -— Ever
heariof a popcorn farmer? Per-
haps that's because there‘re so
few in Pennsylvania. Agriculture
Secretary Jim McHale wishes
there were more and says farm-
ers may be missing out on a good
thing.

Pennsylvania farmers produce
only five per cent of the 1.5 mil-
lion pounds consumed annually in
the state. McHale says it‘s a good
cash crop because ,there are few

labor’ and storage problems in-—

According to Kaplan, he will recommend—presumably to the State

court in the case, filed Tuesday by New Jersey against the Federal .

Kaplan also urgedother states with lotteries to join the suit. Other g:

_ examining various restaurants in
the Pittsburgh area.

7 ‘ ’ by ANDREW J. SOPKO

 While‘ our city's venerable tem-
: ples of haute cuisine must patient-
'_“y.await their turn to appear upon
 these pages, I have decided to be-
 '-in’ this seasons gastronomic tour
_f'Pittsburgh with one of the bet-
’ ter .':famil_V“ restaurants which
have recently opened in our midst.
-The appearance of Kha1il‘s in
Oakland is welcome indeed. es-
pecially at a_ time when there
would seem-to be such a prolifer-
..-ation of Middle Eastern restaur-
ants throughout the area, and
while the number of such estab-
ishments may be ‘legion before
orig (What better form of family
business could there be?). Khal-
1"-"s’certainly has the incentive to

After ushering ourselves into
rather unpretentious surround-
ings replete with music of the
Middle East. we were presented
with a bountiful menu which was
covered with fairly unpretentious
prices as well (about $4 per per-
son). It seems reasonable to judge
a restaurant upon its specialty
and Khalil's proclaims its kabobs
to be that specialty. Upon tasting
our respective beef and shish ka-
bobs. we decided that they were
indeed tasty and very propelfly
seasoned; though not the most
succulent I had every experienc-
ed. they were nonetheless. quite’
edible.

In purchasing a complete meal

necessary accoutrements; Syrian
bread. an enormous salad. a large
portion of rice, and dessert. Our
rice was most meritable. espe-_
cially when one recalls the lib-
eral libation of pignolia nuts which

topped it. The salad was, as most -

salads are. rather unexciting des-
pite its magnanimous size. Des-
sert made the entire meal _all the
more, worthwhile-large portions
of baklava pastry dripping with
honey and nuts; a heavenly ending

to a most delightful meal.

carte” menu of reasonable pro-
portions which consisted of,
among other things, three differ-
ent filled pies of meat, cheese, and
spinach and, of course, the ever
present kibee (a dish made with
raw meat). Not being terribly ad-
venturous, we passed on the kibee
but made certain to try the meat
and cheese pies. Both made very
fine side dishes for our meal.

Despite these many fine points.
Khalil does have its drawbacks.
While beverages such as soft
drinks. tea. coffee, and very rich
Turkish 'coffee are available.
neither wine nor liquor is served
on the premises. This, however.
is not a great problem as there
are two bars in close proximity
to the restaurant; one may cer-
tainly find it convenient to take his
apperirit and nightcap at one of
these establishments.

Unfortunately, service was less
than satisfactory in many in-
stances. We found it necessary to

ask for water and we never did re- ’

ceive the butter for our bread.
Small points such as these can
bring disaster to even the finest
meal. Nevertheless, there is a
sense of "unfusiness" and con-
viviality which pervades Khalil
and its staff.

And, then, of course.
there are all those tasty reasons
which I have already listed above.
For the reasonable prices and
high quality of food, Khalil should
not be missed.

Departs From Tradition

by LOIS LEVINSON

‘ The scene of the crime is Spoon River, a typical American farm
town around the turn of this century. Seemingly innocuous towns-
people are the culprits. ,

The anomaly is that all the people in Edgar Lee Masters Spoon
River Anthology are dead and the crimes they speak of are their own
misused lives.

Spoon River is the Studio Theater’s coming attraction.

According to director Jay Silverman, the play usually performed
with the emphasis on patriotism and redemption. Not so with Silver-
man’s production. He'll deal with it from the death side out.

“I’m not touching the religious aspects of the after-life,” says
Silverman, “but I’ll concentrate instead on death’s finality.”

Consequently, Silverman says he’ll probably hold some rehears-
_als in graveyards to give his actors the death-like detachment needed
to portray their ghostly roles.

In another departure from the play’s traditions, Silverman plans
to present the play as lyric theater rather than “straight acting” or
readers theater.

Silverman explains: “The separate pieces all have a definite
beat and rhythm. I want tohear it and see it expressed in the
voices and bodies of the actors so that the whole play has an even
flow and an undercurrent of pathos." ' '

Additional entertainment will be _ provided by two singers
singing traditional folksongs between the spoken pieces which will
tie the play together.’ I

Although its theme seems to lean towards the morose. Silver-
man says that_tl_1e play also contains many humorous parts.

“The only thing typical about the townspeople is Spoon River,”
he. states, “is that they all have something to hide. The stories
build a good picture of the town and run the complete gamut of
human frailities.’’ '

The task Silverman has set for his actors in this eerie pro-
totype of Peyton Place situation is a difficult one, but he claims to
be blessed with one of the-most talented casts assembled for a
Studioproduction. '

Pleased with the progress the Studio Theater has made recently, '

Silverman is anxious about the coming referendum on the student
activities fee.

“I would urge students to vote for retaining the activities fee. It
would be a shame to lose what we have because of apathy.”
_ Spoon River Anthology will be presented on October 20. 21. 27
and 28. s '

Lorcl Honors Franck

With Musical Tribute

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Birthday celebrations are always
birthday celebrations in which the musical medium is used to en-
hance the festivity. This past week. Dr.. Robert S. Lord observed the

150th anniversary of the birth of the noted French composer and or? '-

ganist Cesar Franck. with that medium. And while there was no birth-

day cake, Lord gave us a heaping slice of the composer’s most famous’

organ chorales to celebrate the event at Heinz Chapel.

. ‘Lord presented the final works of Franck’s output, the Chorals A 
in E Major. b minor. and a minor. It was a lengthy (perhaps too lengthy) . "
program, but one which could be easily digested by devotees of the 

late Romantic French school of organ composition.
As this listener cannot be considered part of that group. he found

the compositions to be somewhat tedious at times but also found them ‘ '

to.be rewarding for their majestic insight into the prowess of the
organ as an instrument of emotional force.

‘Brother
  Block’

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

 

Watching Pitt tight end Les Block walk through the Univer-
sit_v’s Student Union. one who might not know his identity would
automatically have to think "stud."

, ’ Wearing a white tank top. a blue striped railroad cap-—the
bill of which sits close to wire rimmed glasses~Block walks

with all the majesty of the explosive football weapon that he is.

Receiving frequent treatment in the Pitt locker room or on
the way to the player's training table, a writer who has had
three ear operations has to listen very closely when Les speaks.
If not‘. a lot of what Les says will not be heard. Les speaks ver_y
softly.

Once tuned in though, what he says makes a lot of sense

"Everybody thinks I had a good season last
year," he said lounging carefree at a nearby
chair. "I don‘t think I had a good season. I did-
n't play that much and I was out because of in-
juries _a lot of the time."

‘Last year "Brother Block," as he is known
by his black fans and companions. had what
-“statistitions would call a good year. He caught
two game winning touchdown passes and to- ,
taled 15 passes for 170 yards. But, as Leslie might say. that's
not cool. to talk about water under the bridge.
This year, Block has caught one TD—against the UCLA
,Bruins—and has accumulated six catches for a total of 98 yards.

 

  

 If he wasn't satisfied with last years stats, he could hardly be

expected to be pleased so far this year. g
Part of the reason that Les hasnot been more productive’ is

 that he has gotten himself hurt at practice sessions before the ’

A Florida State game—in which he played—and sitting out the

§+Nmthmsm%gameim4h%s,amerw%%0f-aHhmg&Bme#-- - —--Mikg--Muﬁeng—',5-—thg —mog

has been accused of being too aggressive on the practice field.
Coaches like people like Block.

When he has gotten his paws on the football though. Block

= -has run like a wild stallion furiously leading a pack of wild

horses in an open field. Black
fury is a good way of saying it.

Like the football team as a
whole, Block has been un-
lucky. During the summer he
came down with mononucleo-
sis.

"—I was working in Youngs-
town as a supervisor. cleaning
empty lots in a purification
program.”

Though the 17 and 18 year
old kids weren’t affected Les
was. But, preparing for the
Florida State game he reas-
sured "ever_ything is cool."

After leaving Pitt Block
would like to end up working
in governmental affairs. He is
majoring in Political Science
and Urban Affairs. That is, un-
less he should go into a pro-
fessional career.

“I don’t know about that." Block quickly interrupted. “My
bod ain’ttoogood.‘.' .

What? How can an athlete who is described as "pure foot-
ball player," who makes such a physical impression on fans. not

- , have the body to play pro football?

Surveying Les’ 6’1”, 220, pound equipment, you can see
many scars that are ordinarily hidden by the uniform he wears,
..the uniform which seems to stretch beyond its capabilities when

‘ he puts it on.

Brother Block could be compared to Roberto Clemente —
the great Pirate rightfielder-—in one respect. Both Les and Rob-
erto seem to get injured a lot.

"It seems like I can get hurt at any time." is the way he ex-
"plained it.

Asked about why he doesn’t jump around, yell, and stomp
to show his enthusiasm, Block was also quick to reply, very soft-
ly, of course.

0' “Enthusiasm is what you feel inside. That‘s what the set
is." ‘-
And so, whether he is nursing anlinjured ankle. suffering
_from his hay fever. or justtplain getting hurt all the time. Les
will have to play the key role if Pitt is to get a few wins this year.

Be cool. brother man. “Brother :Bloc_k'”is enthusiastic.

  Cats   To Rideevvce/.6’?   

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

The Panther gridders will try
to ride the Green Wave of Tulane
tomorrow and come up with their
first win of the ’72 season.

This contest will be held at
7:30 p.m. CDT. the first and
only night game for the Cats this

year. at Tulane Stadium. New
Orleans. La. '
The series with the Green

Wave is 2-0 in favor of Tulane.
In the first game back in 1969 the
Panthers were downed 26-22 on
a last minute touchdown pass.
Last year Tulane clobbered the
Pitt squad, 33-8.

The Green Wave will be bring-
ing in a 2-1 record to tomorrow’s
contest. They defeated Georgia

‘and Boston College, 24-13 and

10-0, respectively. They were
soundly trounced by Michigan in
last week’s game by the score of
41-7.

Defensively. Tulane seems to
be very strong and "may be Pitt’s
toughest test to date."

Two main reasons for the sol-
id performance of the defensive
unit are linebackers Mike Mull-
en and Glen Harder. Mullen. a
6-3. 230 pound senior, is a good
All-American candidate and
Harder. one of the Green Waves
co-captains. is a two year veteran
of the squad.

Along with junior defensive end
Mike Truax and sophomore tackle
Charles Hall, Tulane’s head foot-
ball coach Bennie Ellender feels
he has a galaxy of stars on his
defense.

experienced of them all.” com-
mented Ellender. "We'd like to
think that they (Mullens and
Harder) are the leaders on our
team." ‘

On offense. the Green Wave
will call particularly upon the
services of Doug Bynum. a 5-10.
185 pound junior tailback who
is believed to be one of Tulane’s
top runners.

Sharing the quarterback posi-
tion are sophomore Steve Foley
and senior Mike Walker. Foley
is considered to be the better run-
ner of the two quarterbacks but

Walker possesses the better arm. —Photo by Clarke I

The NCAA soccer playoffs are
a long way off but tonight in
Philadelphia the Pitt soccer team
faces a game that will be influ-
ential in whether or not the boot-
ers are to achieve their season's
goal

Standing in there way are the
Temple Owls. always a tough
team and even more so on
their home field. The booters

must come back to Pittsburgh vic-.

torious to remain in the run-
ning for a possible playoff berth.

The Owls are still reputed to
be a good soccer team. although
the quality of recent Temple
teams doesn‘t come close to
their predecessors of five or six
years ago. The name Temple
used to be synonomous with dy-
nasty in soccer. but things have
changed.

In recent years Pitt has dom-
inated the series with Temple,
last year sending the Owls down

in defeat by a 2-1 score here at.

Pitt Stadium. This season’s Pitt
squad will go into the game un-
defeated, although tied once.

Tulane, however, has not used
their passing game to any great
extent. They passed more in the
contest against Michigan. 28, than
they have in their other two
games combined (the Green
Wave went to the air only 27
times prior to the Michigan con-
test).

“Offensively they run from the

l_ formation. shift the flanker, I"
‘ slot with a split backfield and

they run at you,” related Pitt's
assistant coach Bill Quinter.

 

."Their offense will try to attack
your weakness with continuous
running plays.”

Ellender also commented on
the perspective performance of
his offensive unit. “We’d better
get a good pass rush against
Pitt,” he stated. “I must say
though that our rushing has im-
proved during the season.

“I think Pitt has the best offen-
sive football team we’ve seen this
year," commented 'Ellender on
the.Panthers‘ scoring power.

Pitt's head coach Carl DePas-
qua hopes to be able to prove
Ellender right and has been

working toward that end all week. 

"We’re working on execution
offundamentals this week," he
related. “I know what our prob-
lems have been, and so do our
players. It’s still a matter of

making too many simple mistakes.

and not playing consistent foot-
ball.”

According to Tulane’s

  Temple Tests Boolers

Last week against C-MU. a

sputtering Pitt offense finally—

found the range .and provided
the support to balance the team.

.Joe Luxbacher, who -was hav-

ing a tough time capitalizing on
his opportunities, found the back
of nets quite inviting as he
pumped in two goals. V

Luxbacher now leads the team
in points scored. He has tallied
three goals and two assists in
three games this season. Lux-
bacher holds the all-time Pitt
record for goals scored in one
game. Last year against Edin-
boro. Luxbacher scored seven
times. t

The booters lost interior line-
man Al Jutca for the season when
he sustained a fractured fibula
in the C-MU game. Jutca was
replaced by John Curly. Curly
instantly proved that he could
fill Jutca’s shoes by tallying an
assist.

Pitt goalie Bill Hines will be.
trying for another shutout to

Catching Passes

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

Todd Toerper just walked on and
walked off with a permanent start-
ing role as a Pitt receiver.

The 6-3, 198 pound junior re-
ceived no scholarship to play foot-
ball here at Pitt, or any other col-
lege for that matter, but has come
on to "look like a big-time college
player.”.—-

“I wanted to play around here,
I wanted to play for Pitt.” related
the Pittsburgh native. “I had some
contracts but no solid offers. '

“Some smaller schools like
Dartmouth and Iowa were inter-
ested though,” he added. “I al-
most had a scholarship from Pitt
but they gave a lot of receivers
scholarships that year and I
wasn’t one of them.”

Over the past two years Toer-
per has found it quite profitable
to observe the performance of
Panther receivers and learn from
this. Steve Moyer, one of the

best receivers to ever play for.

the Cats, proved to be a more
than adequate tutor for the young
Panther gridder.

“You can’t help but learn from
an outstanding receiver like Moy-
er.” commented Toerper. “Dur-
ing my freshman and sophomore

years I knew my chance would

be coming this year.
“So I watched what they did

and tried to learn by it. I also

realized that you have to have
your own style though.”

And has his ‘ performance so
far this season shown that he was
an alert pupil under Moyer?

Junior receiver Todd Toe_rper brings down one of his 13 receptions of the '
‘72 season.Toerper is a walk-on at Pitt, he received no football schol-
arshipito attend the university. -

Toerper Earns Keep  

“I’ve had some good spots and
some bad spots this year,” he
stated. “I’ve seen the films on
the games and I see how much
better I can do. I try to reach
a certain goal, I try to be the
best I possibly can.”

Although Toerper had ‘the jit-
ters’ in both the Florida State
and UCLA contests and rates his
performances against Air Force
and Northwesterm as fair to half
decent, he has still‘ managed to
flag down 13 passes for 195 yards
and two touchdowns.

That could have been three
touchdown catches for Toerper
but in Pitt’s 41-13 loss against
Air Force he dropped a pass in
the end zone in the fourth quar-
ter.

“It was late in the game when it
happened, but if it had been close
I_ would have been fractured,”
remarked Toerper on his missed’

TD catch. “I felt bad for Bill ,

(Daniels. the QB at the time). .It
was his first time in the game. I

was upset for him and I was also
upset because you never wanf‘

to drop anything.”

Toerper feels that the Panthers
can come off their 0-4 record and
“can still salvage a half decent
season. We have to put everything
behind us and keep our heads up,”
he explained. '

And what about Toerper’-s
future as a possible professional
player?

“I_ don’t consider myself a pro-
prospect. I don’t see myself as
being really fast. outstanding.”
he said.“It’s an intriguing idea but-
I have to be realistic about it.”

However Todd Toerper sees
his future with (or without) the
pros, his future at Pitt is surf’
to be a dream come true for
any walk-on.

by BART MACK
To say the least. it's been a
bleak year so far- for Pitt

football. With an 0-4 record and
the mystical Pitt jink looming
ever so ominously over their
heads. what more can be expect-
ed from the Panthers than to roll
over and die.

But that’s not the case with
the players’ attitudes and especi-
ally defensive tackle Glenn Hyde.
With a tough game against Tu-
lane this weekend and Notre
Dame the next, Hyde is as op-
timistic as could be expected.

“With a little bit of luck we
could be 4' and 0," Hyde lament-
ed. “We blew two ballgames:
Air Force and Northwestern.
Those two teams we should have
beaten. We just couldn’t make
the big plays when we needed
it.”

That inability to pull off the
big ones seems to have found a
place on the Pitt roster,Iand lately
has been going both ways, show-
ing no preference for the offense
or defense, a defense that Hyde
is proud to be a part of.

-“I think we have a damn good.
excellent defensive rush.” Hyde
said. "We got to Florida State’s
Huff five or six times. That’s
"more than the total of times that
any team got him lastyear.”

But there are those big plays.
like the UCLA 80 yard run and
the winning touchdown for North-
western. that come at times when
the Panthers seem to have gained
the momentum. To pinpoint the
cause of the lightning-like loss
of the Panthers’ temporary suc-
cess isn’t an easy thing to do.

It could be termed as a ‘let-
down’ or perhaps the coaches
fault or even an early celebra-
tion on the part of the players.
At any. rate, it _isn’t very -easy
to explain. even for Hyde, who
has often watched those plays in
utter disbelief.

“It’s definitely not a letdown.”
Hyde remarked.” “It’s something
you can’t explain. You might
call itfmental mistakes but it’s
mainly over aggression. You get
so psyched you forget your assign-
ments.”

If the Panthers are ever going
to come back down to earth, this
weekend must be the game to do
it—if they want to salvage the re-

and for the most part the guys
have hung in there. Our guys
are the most together team I’ve
ever seen.”

Against Tulane Hyde and his
defensive teammates will face an
offense similar to that of Florida
State but with little more of an
accent on the running game.

“The Tulane backs‘ are very
quick. very fast.” Hyde said.
“They like to throw long but
don’t have quite the offensive
punch as Florida State, I’d say
that their running game is their
strength.”

Whichever style of offense the
Green Wave intends to use, they

The Equivalent Of 7 Hiroshima A-Bombs

      Are Being Dropped On .
  Indochina Each And Every Month    

And that’s after six years of protest!

Explosives equal to 420 Hiroshima -‘A-bombs have already
been dropped on Vietnam.

Millions of. men, women and children have been killed,
maimed or left homeless as a result of the bombing.

—-and this is what President Nixon calls a policy 0 “great
restraint”! . . A

He tells us he is winding down the war — and then says that
unless North Vietnam accepts his terms, there will be no re-
duction of the bombing. (As a matter’ of fact, there will prob-
ably _be a further escalation.) , V

“Those who have had a chance for four years and could not
produce peace, should not be given another chance,” Nixon,
October 9, 1968.

On this October 9th, it will be four years.=Can our conscience
stand the guilt of another four years of this kind of immorality
under Richard Nixon?

What are the justiﬁcations we are given for this wasting of
Vietnam and its people? To protect the people of South Viet-
nam from communism? To maintain democracy?

The regime we aredefending suspendselections, muzzles the

press, jails and tortures its political opponents. The people we.

are supposed to be saving are being systematically killed. .

To the survivors, our ﬁght to contain communism in Southeast
Asia (at the same time that we are making business deals with

' communist countries) can only be viewed as hypocritical fa-

naticism, indistinguishable from that which we have sworn to
oppose. ' '

Even as the bombing-and killing have been escalated, most

' I Americans appear to have tuned out on ‘what’s‘happening in
' Indochina. The Nixon Administration is counting on the

American conscience to care only about U.S.’casualties, not
about the lives of Vietnamese. a

Do we really not care about the people we kill?

Americans will not always be able to ignore the consequences
of our actions. We will be asked: How could it happen? Where
were you? What did you do? - . , -

[:1 Just protesting is not enough.
1:] Voting" your conscience is not enough.

Your dollars are crucial. Your dollars can stop the killing.‘Make
it .possible for George McGovern to awaken the people before
November 7.-

President McGovern would end the war.

People of conscience must make this ﬁnal sacriﬁce: contribute
your utmost!

This is our last chance to make a difference.
