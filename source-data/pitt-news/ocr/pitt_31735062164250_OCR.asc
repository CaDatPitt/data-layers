SG Debates Closed

Meetings, Defeats
By—law Proposal

By AL J ANEZIC

After a lengthy discussion Thursday night, Student
Government decided to wi‘pe out a proposed by-law that

S , could close SG meetings to the public.

SG senators debated for over a half‘ hour on a seg-
ment of a by-law which would give the president, with

two-thirds of they se:1ate,.power to
ban the general public from meet-
ings but admit the news media.-
This portion of the by-law was
then amended to permit exclusion
of all, including the news media.

Deletes By-Law

When bickering continued how-
ever, the senators voted to delete
the entire original portion of the
by-law, including the amendment,
and erased the matter from
consideration.

As matters now stand, said
President John Vrana, a‘ meet»
ing may be closed only by a
two-thirds vote of the senate
after a motion for such action
has been made at a. previous
meeting.

In other business, Vrana an-
nounced that SG is working to
channel $3,200 of identiﬁcation
card proﬁts to the Student Affairs
Committee.

To Contact Monnett
He said"'he will contact Lawr-
ence Monnett, assistant chancel-
lor for business affairs, to dis-
cuss the appropriation.

Senator Jerry Hogan remind-
ed the senators that tomorrow
and September 29 are the last
days that students may redeem
book receipts at the Book Ex-
change.

Room 306 SU, will be open
from 9 a.m.. to 4 p.m. both days

‘for refunds, said Hogan, but re-

ceipts will not be honored after
September 29. '

In follow-up action, a letter

has been sent to Gov. William‘

W. Scr.anton protesting the state’s
ﬁve per cent sales tax on college
textbooks.

SG also hopes to gather peti-
tions today which support a ten
per cent discount on books in the
Book Store.

The fall Student Union Board Midday
Series begins Wednesday in the SU Ball-
room with James Farmer, National Direc-
tor of the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE). Farmer will answer questions at

coﬂ"ee -hour, 3 p.m. in the lower lounge’ of
the Student Union. A

Farmer organized the ﬁrst chapter of CORE
in. 1942 .at the University of Chicago “to substi-
tute bodies for exhortations” and to apply the
nonviolence that Gandhi successfully used in
India’s struggle for independence to the strug-
gle for racial equality.

The ﬁrst Freedom Riders led by Farmer
spent forty days in a Mississippi_jail in the spring
of 1961. In August, 1963, Farmer was again im-
prisoned for leading a civil rights demonstration
in Plaquemine, Louisiana. The 232 others ar-
rested were charged with disturbing the peace
and obstructing the sidewalk.

Fair Protest Held

When the New York World's Fair opened
April 22, Farmer and other CORE members were
arrested for their protest of segregation and
discrimination practices by state exhibits at the
Fair.

In 1958, Farmer was one of ﬁve men from
the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions sent to fifteen African countries. He
also took part in the organizing drive in the
South of the Upholsterers’ International Union
from 194-6 to 1948, and later as the State, Coun-
ty, and Municipal ‘Employees Union interna-
tional representative.

He served as race relations secretary of the
Fellowship or Reconciliation from 1941 to 1945.
Other positions held by Farmer include Program
Director for the NAACP and commentator on
radio and television programs sponsored by the
United Auto ’Workers in Detroit.

new name.”

To brighten the Den, the
recreation committee painted
the walls and sketched cartoon
murals in the pool room, strung
college pennants in the dance
area, and hung a red and white
awning in the Pine Room.

By the time the committee ﬁn-
ished they felt they had the be-
ginning of .a real college recrea-

tion center: a dance room which ‘

boasted a jukebox; a pinball ma-
chine room with three games of
varying difficulty, plus a mina-
ture coin-operated bowling alley;

and a pool room with three stan-
dard-size tables.

Pool Price Steep

It is debatable, however, wheth-
er the three pool tables _(a small
number compared to the 25 found
at Purdue University) are not
more expensive than those at
commercial pool rooms. To good
pool players who are used to pay-
ing by the hour instead of the
game, the Cub’s Denis price of
a quarter a game seems pretty
steep.

Attendance in the Den has
also been a problem. As one
co-ed put it, “The last time I

was down there, there were '

two kids there from Freshmen
Orientation playing pool, and
that was it.” Attendance has
definitely picked up since the
beginning of the Fall term
though. “There has been a 30
per cent increase over past
years,” according to Bartok.

Bartok still hopes to bring more
students down to the area. “There
are mostly engineers down there

—now. I hope to drag out more

kids from Liberal Arts.”

Student Edward Holmes Tours

Russia and Practices Language

- By SANDY FOX

- “Zdrastujti!” For three months
this summer this was the way
Edward Holmes, a senior major-
ing in Russian, said “Hello!”
Holmes represented the Univer-
sity as one of 27 American col-
lege students who toured Russia
with a program sponsored by the
University of Michigan.

During his one-and-a-half
months of preparation at the Uni-
versity of Michigan and during
his entire visit to the Soviet
Union, English became the for-
gotten language, Russian the

‘ familiar.

Holmes was chosen for this
trip because of his grades, the
number of years he had studied
the Russian language, recom-
mendations he received, and a
letter which he wrote. He won
three scholarships, the largest one
coming from the University of
Michigan, which enabled him to
make the trip.

Shortly after he arrived in Rus-
sia, university students at a
Youth Camp greeted the Ameri-
can group by playing guitars and
singing, in Russian, “When the
Saints Go Marching In.” In Kiev
a Ru ssian cosmonaut staying in
their hotel said “Hello!” to them
through a note delivered by a
waitress.

That the Russian people liked
America and American ways
somewhat awed Holmes. He
found that Russians listen to

if they could help them to get
out of the Soviet Union.
Holmes encountered the “most
unsafe airline you ever want to
ride on” in Leningrad, the ﬁrst
city which the group toured.
“Leningrad’s most stunning fe.a-

“Kiev,” Holmes believes, “is ,
its many parks and trees.”
Finding any beauty in Russia
somewhat surprised him.\“'l'he
most beautiful parts within each
city are the subways.” He noted
the contrast, however, between
the poorly dressed people and
the elegant subways with their
colored marble and -glass chan-
deliers.

On the streets, women driving
steam ‘rollers and sweeping along
the curbs served as examples of’
Soviet equal rights.

Before they left home, the
Americans had learned a song,
“Lenin is Always With You.” The
song applies to all Russia, Holmes
emphasizes. Signs reading “On-
ward to Leninism” and “Onward
to Communism” were everywhere
through the country. Holmes also
noted that the government pushes
atheism; anyone who joins a re-
ligion is an outcast.

\ The American students en-
countered many “blacketeers”
in their travels. Holmes deﬁnes
blacketeers as “people who like
to dress in Western style and
buy‘ clothes from foreigners.”

But, he adds, one Russian ex-

plained blacketeers as “people

who buy clothes from for-
eigners and sell them to the

Russians”,

As a ﬁnal lesson in interna-
tional diplomacy, Holmes warns,
“If a Russian ever invites you to
have a drink with him, don’t re-
fuse! He’ll be insulted if you do.”

By Larry Bernfeld

The classical traditionalists have now accepted
the works of Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Ravel under
the banner of good music. Yet, these composers still
are not granted the eminence of Bach and Mozart
in'the standard symphony nor in the eyes of the
classicist critics. -

In view of the disagreement among the classi-
cists within their own discipline over what consti-
tutes good, it is not really surprising to see them
make a perfunctory rejection of a musical element
so seemingly foreign as jazz.

. BERNFELD Yet jazz isinot quite so foreign an idea as the
traditionalist may think. It does, after all, share the basic qualities of
 music with the more traditional forms. Melody, rhyhm, and harmony
i‘ are all present in the jazz forms. It is just that these qualities are treat-
II. led with different emphases, creating diverse effects.

WHILE SHARING the basic characteristics which qualify jazz as
“music it is nonetheless’ a separate art form from the classical and it
'. should be judged by separate standards. .

 _ Marshall Stearns, in his book, The Story of Jazz, highlights some
Wcrucial points in distinguishing between the two schools—classical and
 jazz—and in explaining the void which jazz serves to ﬁll as a musical
 form. ‘

The basis of classical.music in the European tradition lies in the
 use of‘ the tempered scale, “an arbitrary system whereby the pure pitch
:«-of some notes is raised and the pitch of others lowered, so that the
C errors are more or less evenly distributed.” Jazz has developed under
- the influence of certain eastern scales such asare more common in
*Africa.

 
   
 
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
  

. _. The tempered scale gave rise to harmony and chords, based on
 the so-called true pitch. Yet this formal scale had to make some com-
V promises. It did not have- the freedom and the manipulatability of the
.;~EAfri'can scale. Classical music continued to develop along the formal
. structural lines o-f complex harmony.’ ‘

STEARNS points out that with the growing complexity of classical
"compositions (and thereby its scoring and performances), the audience
1 became passive and remote. This, he feels, “inevitably led to the loss of
such characteristics as spontanous improvisation, group participation
and other qualities of direct and immediate communication.” .

T‘ . The “blue tonality” of the African scale with its lowered third and
, seventh (not appearing on the tempered keyboard scale), had been car-
..ried to America by Negro slaves early in this country’s history. When
V: the Jazz Age in America‘began, it simply carri'ed the Negro’s uninhibited
. p-"blues melodies and their strange but infectious rhythm patterns to the

public through newly developed "methods of mass communication——the
radio, the phonograph, the movies—and of course through the travelling
one-night musicians themselves. ~

Jazz” began to ﬁll the void which classical music had reﬁned and
intellectualized its way out of. The critics still complained. “The rhythm
is too simple. It’s always written i‘n 4/4.” Yet pianist ‘Jose’ Iturbi with
all his formal training was not able to feel the unrwritten, always shift-
ing duple beat of the boogie-woogie, as did the self-taught Pine-Top
Smith.

TRUE, EARLY jazz had simple beginnings, but it has developed
into a more mature musical form with the passing of the years. Stearns
when writing his book in 1956 foresaw “as far as harmony is concerned,
jazz is travelling . . . toward the stone wall of atonality—but there is
still a long way to go.” Not quite so ong a way perhaps. For less than
a month ago I sat in the Village Gate listening to Jerry Mulligan’s quar-
tet play a piece titled “Utter Chaos”—no structure, no tonal center as
the‘ name implies. ,

Yet the Mulligan cool school represents only one of the varied trains
of jazz thought which remains unacceptable. to the traditionalists. ‘Let
it be kept in mind -that the traditionalists have not yet found it in their
conservative hearts to accept a large part of "the legacy of the school of
serious music——Schonberg, Webern, and other moderns. Then again who
knows how taste will be culturally‘ redeﬁned 25 years from now. Perhaps
some -moderns will achieve the eminence of an old master—like Tchai-
kovsky or Debussy. ‘

All this talk of cultural deﬁnition and redeﬁnition leads, I think, to
an important conclusion. Music in many respects has to be viewed as a
social phenomenon in addition to its -aesthetic role. Perhaps much of the
criticism of jazz and rock-and-roll has a societally oriented base. '

The tradtiionalists are not the only group in society to have rejected
jazz and rock ’_n’ roll. On many different occasions the general American
public has beenup in arms over the “music of this country’s youth.”

WHILE THE classicists have downgraded jazz and R’n’R on tech-
nical and aesthetic grounds, the complaints of the American public have
taken‘ on a more generalized nature. They too have complained loudly
that such music is a lot of noise and little else. But their complaints seem
to be directed at the social effects and connotations of the music.

New Orleans will always be remembered as the early home of jazz.
New Orleans with its shabby’ side streets. dark bistros, and moral laxity,

The social emplications of its early home life have become part and
parcel of the standard image of jazz. This branding has remained as an
enigma to jazz musicians even today—though not always without justi-
ﬁcati'on. The trouble remains, however, that such social implications
have clouded the general public’s perception of the -music of jazz itself.

Ll “ With Mr. J ain’s comment (Sept.

'; on of Chancellor Litchﬁeld as
. shared by President Johnson are
-._high and commendable,” I can

agree. But tp his further com-

 c‘ent that this ‘poses a problem for
‘ Dean Rush because her “type of

education. would stress the wom-
g en’s role in the capacity as mother

=2 and homemaker ﬁrst and that of
 »,_  leaderin busines and administra-
   tionof the country second” is in

conﬂict with Betty Friedan’s

 views, I cannot give assent.

. ‘This is not a matter for the

5* chancellor and Miss Rush to sit
, .down and discuss and decide for

‘anyone but herself or himself.

it The decision to decide career

 and homemaking is very personal
and individual, not something
someone else decides for you. It

.; i ’ is commendable that the chancel-
 - lor gives us women the oppor-
’ T tunities to prepare for careers

without stiplifying the duration

 or extent of these careers.

_ * It is also commendable that the
dean of women will give us the

_' beneﬁt of her experience with in-

'mnner‘able women students seek-
_ ing their solution without forcing

 us to accept her view. This is

the type of guidance policy we

women need—the chance to de- .

Sports Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

If Marvin Zelkowitz, whose col-
umn “With It” would get with
it and learn a little more about
football the Pitt News could have
some reliable football reporting.
For a starter, he could learn his
right from his left and learn on
what side of the line the Pitt
players play. ‘

He then might realizethat Ron
Linaburg and Bill Howley play
on different sides of the line. In
his column (Sept. 14) Zelkowitz
states that UCLA ran over the
side of the above mentioned
players: This is obviously incor-
rect.

Also Kenny Lucas is unfairly
blamed for not calling two plays
in the closing seconds of the
game, since he was alternating
with Fred Mazurek at the time.

Commercialism
Lambasted

Editor, The Pitt News:

As an alumnus of Pitt and a
former member of the Pitt Band,
I feel obligated to Write this let-
ter of criticism.

‘The crass_ commercialism dis-

played by the University _ in al- ‘
owing theband-toidis"la ' ~NBC"s<

fall lineup shows was absolutely
deplorable.

Pitt has done a wonderful job
in bringing its message of aca-
demic_ excellence to the world.
But the September 12 halftime
performance was so poorly con-
ceived that the University gave
the impression for being an ad-
vanced advertising agency for
network television. '

I am certain that University
officials did not realize how dis-
asterous an impression was left
with the viewer. When the an-
nouncer paused for a commercial
the band stopped playing and
continued only when the network
was ﬁnished selling its sponsors
wares. I -

I fully realize that Pitt receives
a large sum of money for having
its football games televised. But
if in doing so it must forget its
academic objectives then foot-
ball no longer deserves a val-
uable place on the campus.

 ’ WESTCHESTER WORRIES

DEFEATIN G FROSTBURG, 4-2, in the opening soccer game
of: the season, has given soccer coach Leo Bemis reason for
‘ optimism about this coming season. The Panther booters
have scoring balance, perhaps even more than they had
on their 1962 team that lost in the Eastern Division
-tournaments of the NCAA playoffs.

‘ In left wing Dave Reichenbach and center-forward
George Shimpeno, Bemis has a strong scoring combina-
tion. And with Aldo Zortea at right wi-ng, Bemis has an

; last year,” according to Bemis.
PERHAPS ONE of the strongest assets on this year’s soc-
cerjteam, however, is teamwork. Bemis has often remarked

 that there has been no arguing on this year’s team. This
player rapport is a marked improvement over last year’s
playground tantrums.
. Bemis also feels this year’s set of halfbacks will be
 better-than last year. George Sommers and Jim Snyder.
.:_“Sommers should start coming into his own this year.
 He had some experience last year, and he should be
" much more effective.
Jim Snyder, the other halfback, is only a sophomore.
Although he did not start in the alumni game, Snyder
, is the best sophomore halfback on the team. Overcon-

_ ﬁdence could be his main problem.

_ The halfback positions, however, are not nearly as
- strong as they were two years ago, when.Bemis had
_: All-American Paul Liberati. -
~ SOCCER TEAM has three big fullbacks in co-captain
Andy McGraw, Calvin Bonawitz, and James Cuddy. “That's
 probably our strongest position,” Bemis explained.
. The Panthers may need exceptional fullbacks to

' beat.Westchester this year, if goalie continues to be a
_a question mark in Bemis’s mind. Before the game with
, Frostburg, Bemis expressed concern about his goalten-
3* ~.ders. “They’re my biggest concern right now,” he said.
 ._ Buit Bemis’s problems might have been solved on Sat-
.- ur ay. » .

with yielding a goal. He might need a similar performance

coming Saturday. ‘

in defense, and they scored enough times to make the
quarter-ﬁnals in the NCAA competition last year.

Their line is less experienced this year, so they will
probably lack some of the scoring punch they had last
year. But they are one of the strongest teams the Pan-
thers will play‘ this year.
Westchester coach Mel Lorback, who dubbed his
team “The Scoreless Wonders,” doubts his team’s scor-
ing ability. “Unless the shooting power and accuracy of
our shooting shows dramatic improvement, it looks as
4 _ though we are in for another frustrating season.”
IF THE PANTHER soccer team can add to that feeling of
frustration this Saturday, they may be on their way to a
winning season.

Offense Dominates Play,
Prepares for Westchester

By BILL CABIN

Although the element of rain hampered the; varsity soc-
cer team last Saturday, they had enough positive elements
in their favor to score decisive win in its opener at Frost-
burg State. College.

The varsity held Frostburg scoreless until the fourth
quarter in winning their game, 4-2. Dave Reichenbach scored two of
the goals, while Aldo Zortea and Vince Bartolotta each had "one.

Coach Leo Bemis said, “We were stronger than them and
dominated play the entire game. If it hadn’t been for the rain
we might have scored a few more goals.” In mentioning the rain,
Bemis referred to several puddles which developed near the goal
and prevented the booters from scoring two or three addition-
al goals.

The booters, however, had unity and depth in their favor. Prior
to the game, Bemis had mentioned, “There will be several openings
for sophomores and they’ll help give us added depth.” His forecast
was validated when sophomores Vince Bartolotta .and Sal Tavares
started at the inside positions, and Jim Snyder played left halfback.

Bemis said, “Both Bartolotta and Tavares are good ball handlers
and have a lot of hustle. Snyder has good speed.” As a result of their
performance against Frostburg, these players proved that they could
play effectively under game stress.

Besides the sophomore starters, Bemis also got good per-
formances from his veterans. “Jim Cuddy played a whale of a
game, and Sommer and Reichenbach played a. lot of good ball.”

. The booters also had the services of fullback Call Bonawitz,‘ whose
eligibility was conﬁrmed Friday and right wing Aldo Zorter,
who had been injured.

Bemis said, “Theboys played beautifully together and it was .a
good ﬁrst game. We’ve got a team that wants to win and has the
talent to do it.”

Bemis was able to supplant his starters with strong bench sup-
port. Of the twenty players that dressed, nineteen played. Bemis said,
“I don’t feel bad when I put in substitutes. They’re of good quality
and give us good depth.”

Bemis’ depth men include Sam Donatelli, Jim Meyers, and Fred
Slauer on the line, George Schaeffer and A1 Trautensteiner at half-
backs, and Art Richardson at fullback. Bemis also said that “Ken
Lang turned in a good game at goalee.”

Bemis was pleased with the play of his inside men and half-
backs, and feels they’ve made considerable improvement over Last
year. “Our middle men are in better shape, and appear more capable
oftaking charge of the ball at mid ﬁeld.” V ,

Despite their showing at Frostburg, Bemis feels the varsity still
had much work to do before their home opener with Westchester.

Freshmen Run Well As Oregon

Against Panther Defen

By GEORGE LIES ’ '

“We need an offensive
and defensive scrimmage,”
was Coach Miche1osen’s
comment after the football
team’s two and one-half
hour workout Saturday morn-
ing at Trees Field.

With the freshmen running
the Oregon offensive plays
Michelosen put the ﬁrst three
units in to let them get a look
at the offense that they will

. face next Saturday. Bob Bazy-
lak, who ran the Oregon offen-
sive plays, ran the quarterback
option many times successfully
against the Panther’s defensive
‘set-up.

All the scoring by the ﬁrst
string was done by end Bill
Howley. He scored once on a-
33-yard end-around play and a
second time on a 35-yard screen
pass and run play from Fred
Mazurek. These two scores came
against a set-up Oregon de-
fense.

Panther Backs Average 5.6
Yards PerTryAgainst UCLA

A review of t-he ﬁrst football game rushing ‘statistics
show the Panther backﬁeld has no lack of groundgaining
ability; Panther backs rushed for 218 net yards in 39 car-

ries for a 5.6 yard per try aver-
age.

Leading all runners was quar-
terback Fred Mazurek, who only
played for 13 minutes during the
UCLA game. Mazurek carried the
ball ten times for 81 yards.

Second in rushing‘ was ﬁrst
team fullback Barry-McKnight,
who canted the ball nine times

-for 51 yards, averaging 5.7
yards per try.

Dale Stewart was the third
leading rusher, as he carried the
ball four times for 37 yards, a
9.3 yard per try average.

Fullback Jim Flanigan, al-
though only carrying the ball
twice, led the second unit in
rushing, as he gained 30 yards.

The Panthers’ passing ﬁgures
were less impressive. Mazurek
completed ﬁve \ out of eight
passes for 76 yards, and had
0116 pass intercepted.

Second unit quarterback Ken‘
Lucas did not fare as well, com-

pleting only three passes out of
ten for 36 yards. Like Mazurek,
Lucas had one pass intercepted.
