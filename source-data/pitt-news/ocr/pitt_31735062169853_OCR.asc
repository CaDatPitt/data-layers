UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Students Visit Kehl

Language Requirement Protested  

By Virginia Joyce
Staff News Writer
Armed with the support of 120
faculty members. 30 students
approached James Kehl. dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences.
Monday seeking abolition of the
present language requirement at
the University.

Led by Ronald Cohen. chairman
of an ad-hoc committee to push
for the abolition. and Louis Brisk-
man. SG senator who campaign-
ed on the premise of getting rid
of the requirement. the group
was to “ask Dean Kehl to recom—“
mend abolition to the faculty or
give concrete reasons why not.“

“You can't forcefeed language
to students." claimed Briskman.
He cited that 18 to 20’; of the fresh-
men are on probation._"much of
it directly attributable to the lan-
guage requirement.“

Kehl did not commit himself, al-
though he admitted that the “lan-
guage requirement was a type of
appendage.” “I’ll have to have _it
out with the chairmen of the de-
partments before I can make any
recommendations,” he said.
He said a moment later, however,
that “the language chairmen
refuse to give any rationale for
the language requirement.”

Dr. Kehl informed the group.
which included several senators

and the new president and vice-
president of SG. that the ques-
tion has been under considera-
tion since 1960 when four terms
of language were first included
as a requirement for a degree in
the_CAS.

Kehl's proposal of alternatives.
such as a possible pass fail sys-
tem or “civilization -studies"
did not satisfy the students pres-

ent. They were objecting to the
required part of the requirement.

“A student should be able to
make the choice by the time he is
a college freshman,” insisted
Cohen.

The hour and a half confronta-
tion forced the Dean to admit that
although he intended to give the
requirement issue top priority
at the Undergraduate Council

Faculty Senate Legitimacy Questioned

meeting Tuesday. he did-not ex- -
pect a review of the problem
to be satisfactory. ‘

“I think that a review may

be just whistling ‘Dixie.’ So. un- ’

less those in favor of the require-
ment come up with a darn good,
way of reviewing I the lan-
guage requirement. I will have to
move to abolish it as a require-
ment." he said. —

Peake Promises Interim Committee  

A confrontation Monday be-
tween Charles Peake. University
provost and about .60 students
brought about a promise from
him to set up an interim commit-
tee to study the curricular prob-
lem. Peake also surprised those
present with an avowal of sup-
port for the ROTC program on cam-
pus.

dents must have a Winter Weekend Ticket and be present at the draw-

ing on Friday night.

Present to offer "moral sup-
port” to Dr. Peake were David Hal-
liday. dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. and Dr. Samuel Hays
of the History Department.

The students. led principally by
Joe Kociubes. chairman of the

Liberal Arts Cabinet. Joseh Chasen.

teaching fellow in history and’
John Wills of the Philosophy De-
partment. sought to have the
chairman‘of the committee-to
study-curricular-review appoint-

ed by the_LAC.

Halliday believed that “the
faculty would not accept a chair-
man named by the students.”
Peake was of the same opinion.
“The faculty will not support you
students. I believe that in the
last analysis we can only move
forward on the basis of mutual
confidence,” he said.

‘When urged by those present
to call the faculty senate togeth-
er immediately to consider the
chairmanship and composition
of the cirricular committee, Hal-
liday said that “he did not intend
to do this until the by-laws for
the faculty senate (FAS) which
are now in committee are voted
on.”

This will not be accomplished

Charles Peake
until at least March 7 when a

day-long open hearing on the by-
laws will be conducted. The stu-
dents were not satisfied with the
delay of what they considered “a
very important problem.”

In response, both Peake and Hal- .

liday concurred with a sugges-
tion to set up an interim com-
mittee to work on curricular
problems while the by-laws of the
FAS are being structured.

The two administrators agreed
to have the LAC appoint the chair-
man of this interim committee.
He will then be subject to review
by the FAS. The two other mem-
bers of the committee will be
appointed by the Undergraduate

Council which is chaired by Dean
James Kehl of the College of Arts
and Sciences. .

The faculty member for the
chairmanship decided upon will
be given half-time off with pay
in order to allow him time to un-
dertake the research. Secretar-
ial aid for the committee will
also be provided by the adminis-
tration. .

The question of the legitimacy
of the faculty senate was the sec-
ond major issue debated by the
members of the administration
and student body.

Peake insisted that the students
presently enrolled in the ROTC
program at the Universityjshould
be permitted to pursue the pro-
gram with accredidation. '

“No major change can .be re-
troactive.” claimed the Provost.
“This is a fundamental rule of
this University. It’s a moral and
legal obligation.”

“But that’s not the issue.” aver-
red Dr. James Holland, LRDC.
The issue is that the change was
done outside of FAS channels.
I’m objecting to the method.”

FACES

CCThe film was included on the program of a

\

t%\“‘“

film festival organized under the auspices of
the Tennessee Arts Commission. A strangely
heterogeneous audience—high school and
college kids, housewives, businessmen, sec-
retaries, academic types, and a smattering
of beards and love beads—had endured two
exhausting days of seminars, panel discus-
sions and screenings by the time FACES
was to be shown. .

FACES—-and Ijsay this calmly as I can—is a '

beautiful film. It is a unique film. I have
never responded, I have never seen an audi-
ence respond as we did that night. The faces
that we saw were our own.

The film is the acting, and the players in
FACES, all of them—]ohn Marley, Gena
Rowlands, Lynn Carlin, Seymour Cassel, and
the others—simply gave, were allowed to
give, the performance of their lives.79

  A Dying Dictate

“Any college is a living thing that,.cis it grows older, ought to discover the secret of
sell-renewal. The curriculum for such a college must not be a set of rules and regula-
tions but a series of principles productive of institutions and programs that grow and

adapt to changing needs . . ."

—Warren Sussman, The Reconstruction of The American College '

Like all living things, colleges and
universities can die the death of stag-
nation. Like all civilizations. the colleg-
es and universities that fail to adapt
to changing times become archaic and
irrelevant.

The relevance of higher education.
of course. relates to the institution’s
curriculum. And two questions must
be raised continually:

Is the curriculum at this Univer-
sity relevant? Does the curriculum at
the University meet the inquisitive
and educational needs of the students?

There can be no question that the
curriculum at the University is in need
of reform. University Provost. Dr.
Charles Peake stated at the mass stu-
-dent-faculty meeting. that a commit-
tee is being formed to study the Uni-
versity’s monolithic curriculum.

At that".-Monday meeting, Dr. Peake

told a group of students that Dean Da-
' .vid Halliday would be appointing a

~ member- of the faculty to chair the

forming committee.

The group of concerned students
and faculty took exception to this dic-
tate by asking Dr. Peake to allow the

. Academic Cabinet of the College to se-
lect the member of the faculty to be
the Committees chairman. Dr. Peake
consented. . '

The Peake decision. however. is
not final. The Undergraduate _Coun-.
cil must pass judgment on the issue.
And we urge the Council to affirm Dr.
Peake’s decision because the potential
for a curriculum committee selected
by the students and faculty is great.

The combination of the selection
process gives the students some voice
in determining their curriculum. But if

the committee that could be formed
remaines closed (restricted to cer-
tain members of the faculty) the stu-
dent voice would be quite indirect and
ineffective.

This, in our view would be raking
over old coals. The students - the Uni-
versity element most affected by the
curriculum — would still remain in the
background.

One suggested idea that could
overcome this problem would be to
open up the curriculum committee
meetings to public audiences where
any student‘ could voice his opinion
about cirriculum priorities. And the
committee could let the community of
students and faculty write its own cur-
riculum report.

If the greatbod_v of sentiment re-
inforced that status—quo. the report
would stress that viewpoint. If on the
other hand. the sentiment suggested
the removal of the distribution of stud-
ies program. the committees report
would refleeft this idea. Nothing could
be more democratic and geared’ to in-
dividual needs and requests.

Discontent is breeded through
frustration. And many students and
faculty, it seems, are frustrated with
the outmoded curriculum of the Uni-
versity. But frustrations can be aired
in public meetings ‘geared to the in-
dividual academic concerns of stu-
dents and faculty.

Public meetings involving this
academic ‘community's curricular rele-
vance are sorely needed. And it's up
to the Undergraduate Council to get
the wheels of curricular progress
rolling. An affirmative decision by the
Council can only improve this institu-
tions academic prestige.

Rep. .Clears—Up Issue

Editor. The Pitt News .

I am writing this to clarify my views
as reported in the article in “The Pitt News”
dated February 14. 1969 cntitlcd “Kauf-
man Raps Fleming."

I am in total disagreement with the
type of legislation proposed by Senator
Fleming and Representative Zord. Not only
won't such legisfation curb the kind of stu-
dent behavior that il attempts to control.
it will probably intensify it. In my view this
type of repressive legislation will produce
a counter-reaction in the student commu-
nity.

I believe that the desire of universit_v
students to participate in thc decision
making process in thc community in which
they live is legitimate and healthy for our
society. In fact. I am much morc conccrn-
ed about the apathetic student majority
who don't care enough to get involved. In
the long run. I believe that they present a
much greater danger to our society.

I feat that the proposed legislation
will be interpreted by thc students as an
attempt by the “establishment" to sup-
press legitimate dissent and will only
serve to convince many that change

 

through dcmocratic means is not possible.
If university ol'f'i(-ia'.s belicyc that student
activities havc bccomc illcgal. they have
acccss to the courts to settle thc manor.

Howcver. I want to make it clear that
I have thc higlicst respect for both Senator
Flcming and Rcprescntatiyc Zord as individ-
uals. The implication in the article that
thc motivation of those men in proposing
this legislation was something other than
an honest bclicf in its propriety. is unwar-
rantcd. —

I know both Senator Fleming and Rep-
rescntativc Zord wcll and I can assure
you that they both sincercly believe that
those proposed bills are honest solutions
to what they considcr to bc a difficult so-
cial problem. I have disagreed with both
men in thc past and. I am sure. will do so in
thc. futurc.

I belicve. however. that the mark of a
civilized man is the ability to disagree
with another on issues without attribut-
ing base motives to him or attacking his
character or integrity.

Very truly yours.

Raped Of Dignity  

   

By DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

If somconc had come in at the middle
of cxiled South African leader. Gladstone
.\'labati's lecturc last Friday. they would
probably have thought that he was spcak-
ing on thc dilemma of black Amcrica. The
attitudes towards thc black man. the pres-
ent response of blacks. and thc thrcats
than thcy rcprescnf. ‘
werc so similar in
South Africa and thc  
U.S. that they almost 
paralleled cacli othcr:
action for action and cf- "
loci for effect. ‘

.\'labati pointed out
how the British tried to
change the Black Afri-’
cans into- Black Eng-
lishmen. He showed
how the white man in South Africa first
stripped the black population of their dig-
nity and humility. and thcn brainwashed
thcm into wanting lo be like their white
opprcssors. while all’ the time using all
mcans trying to keep them from this goal.

THIS IS EXACTLY what the white man
in America has done to the black man over
thc centuries. He has tricd to substitute
his own values for those things that blacks
should have rcally been concerned with.
Until thc comparatively recent revolu-
tion. the black man really felt that the
only heritage that he had was‘ what he
had been taught in thc whilc history books.

His Ihouglus had been pattcrned not
to wondcr. if maybe his pcople had made
any significant contributions to socicfy.
He was made to fecl that it was his own
peoples fault that thcy were living in finn-
ger. povcrty. and hopclessncss.

 

In other words. as Nlabati pointed out.

in South .-\frica and the United States the
black man was brainwashed info belicv—
ing that ho was inferior. and thercfore was
mcant to suffer.

NLABATI SAID in the lecture that his
people likc black Amcricans tried to awak-.
en the white man to their plight in non-
violcnt ways. but that this manncr did not

ROTC: Villain Or Victim

By DAVID EHRENWERTH
Special to The Pitt News

Most psychologists agree that be-
cause man desires to obtain a complete
picture of things. hc seeks and acccpts
simple. categorical solutions to complex
problems. Whcn two
groups lake opposing
stands on an issue. the
avcrage student seems
to consider eycrything ‘ _
-thcir sidc does as cor- j_ --
recl. While all the ac-
tions of the other sidc
arc wrong and cyil.

The ROT(' contro-

has shown that

this is not the case. I fully agrcc that the
usc of "sccret memorandums" and "out-
sidc pressure" is most improper. But
thcrc is no need f'or me to talk about those
occurrences. Others have publicized them
quitc adcquately. However. I am concern-
ed about the lack of attention given to the
totall_y unjustifiable actions of the oppon-
ents of ROTC.

IT IS disconcerting when administra-
tors are not responsive to student opin-
ion. but it is far morc disgusting when so-
called student leaders couldn't care less
what thc studcnl body fecls. An editorial
in this newspaper angrily talked about
thc possibility of “King Posvar" overrul-
ing the faculty vote on ROT(‘. Yet not a word
was said about "King Schueler" and his
senate when t hey passcd a resolution
against accrediting R()TC.

This resolution was thc exact oppos-
ite of thc cxprcssed wishcs of thc studcnt
body in not one but two refcrcndums. Many
more people voted for ROTC than votcd to
elect Ken Sc-huclcr as S.G. Prcsidcnt. Thcrc
is much talk about apathy on campus._
Wc can't even‘ get students to vote in the
Student Government elections. I ask one
qucstion: If you took the lime Io volc in
two refcrcndums and thou saw studcnt
goycrnmcnt disregard both of thcm. would
you go to the trouble of voting again‘?

Scot! Baum has said hc wants the new
Student Government to bc reprcsentative
of the students: he says their wish will be
his command. Well. I'm waiting .\lr. Baum.

 

fl'm fascinated by the tactics of" our V"

"Student Powcr" advocates. They claim
thcy want students to havc a larger voice
in the decision-making process of the Uni-
versity. So thcy takc referendums. The
students vote against having a language
requiremcnt. Fine. '

JOE KOCIUBES CAN run to Dean Kehl
and proclaim that the students have spo- .
ken. Sincc thc studcnt body is anti—lan-
guage rcquirement. it is Kociubess “re-
sponsibili'f_v" as Chairman of the Acadcmic
Cabinet to fight against this requirement.
But what if a referendum happens to go
against our Student loaders’ personal fcel- '

ings — as the ROTC referendums did? That 

- a different story.

‘Now the Academic Cabinet becomes
an "innoyativc forcc" that disregards the
feclings of our ignorant student body. Joe I
and Ken get together with their friends in
thcir private offices and personally de-
cidc if ROTC fits the standards of this I'ni-
versitv.

Their actions aren't very different
from those of .\Ir. Boers at central print-
ing. who wouldn't print Alternatives be-
cause it violalcd his personal bcliefs. At
least it's nice to know that our student and
administrative "censors" use the same
techniqucs. Kcn Schueler demanded cu-
trance into thc faculty mccting on ROTC.
He said he had a responsihility lo the stu-

dems. I wondcr which two or three stu-~/T5’

dents he had in mind.

But what about this irifamous faculty
volc. Surely the faculty would research
thc matlcr thoroughly and act rational-
ly. It might interest somc of this papcr‘s
readers to know that Professor Rosenberg.
Chairman of thc faculty committee inves-
tigating ROTC rcportco that his commit-
tec did not hayc nearly sufficient timc to
study thc matlcr adcquatcly. Dr. Rosen-
berg openly admitted tha‘. he did not have
timc to talk to any ROTC studcnts about
thc program. _

Clearly. mistakcs havc been madc by
people on both sides of the ROTC question.
Bigoted viewpoints have rcsullcd is the
issue bcing distorlcd and misliandlcd.
It is up to all concerned to see that this sit-

mPlayl1ouse Presents Pinter

By JOHN DREYER
Staff Feature Writer

Saturday night. Eight Revue Sketches and two
one-act plays by contemporary British playwright
Harold. Pinter opened at the Pittsburgh Playhouse.

The three selections. presented in increasing
order of depth and insight. represent Pinter's de-
velopment and maturation in the literary art of un-
derstanding and finding meaning (or lack of it) in
human situations. One notices an increase in the
presence of the "absurd" in the selections. verg-
ing on the ultimate confusion of life itself as seen
in the characters‘ exchange of roles in the two short
plays.

Cecil Kitcat. colorful actress and dance teach-
er at the Playhouse School. opens the.first of the
Eight Revue Sketches walking on stage from the rear
of the theatre. involving the audience from the start.
In almost all of the sketches. the actors are con-
stantly and deliberately aware of the audience. to
whom Pinter's message seems earnestly directed.

In the fourth sketch, “The Last to-Go,” the two
actors, in_ a pub, participate in a dialogue without
addressing or ‘looking at each other, but staring
into air or at the audience, reminding us of our own
isolation from other humans despite our sameness
with the crowd.

Tina Holmes. a Carnegie Mellon student. ap-

pears in two of the sketches which-show opposite
extremes of one person s possible effect on anoth- _

er. In “The Applicant." she represents cruelty and
sadism that can dominate another person. putting
him entirely at the mercy of his environment.

In “That’s All.” she shows the meaninglessness
of some people‘s existence. The characters and di-
alogue of this last sketch are. in fact. so devoid of
meaning and consequence. that the audience must

 

(the exact opposite of what they really are’) be-
coming different characters: each other's lover
during the day. The absurdity of their game occurs
to them shortly after the audience realizes it. and
when the husband attempts to consolidate their
split personalities. he succeeds only in reversing
their roles.

Although the actors in these Pinter selections
all do an excellent job. Dan Frezza and Anne Muffly
excell in the last and best of the plays. "A Slight
Ache" deals with a landed upper-class English cou-
ple in their provincial estate. Again the futility.
emptiness and horror of man's existence come in-
to focus. - _ ‘

In the beginning. Edward. the husband. re-
proaches his seemingly small-minded wife. Flora.
for having felt so threatened by a wasp which they
catch in a marmelade jar at teatime. This “beast."
however threatens Flora much less than the aged
matchseller who Edward has noticed standing out-
side his garden in the street for several days.

Sensing danger in the old man's presence.
Edward summons him indoors for questioning only
to find that he is. “like a bullock.” incapable of
any speech or communication. More important.
though. Edward begins to identify with the Match-
seller. feeling the anguish of identity with the old
man’s’meekness.

“Yesterday it was so defined." he says.
life was accounted for.” g

The matchseller remains silent.

“You‘re not laughing." says Edward. "You’re
crying for me. my plight! ”

Flora. also seeing the identity and nothingness

of the two. gives Edward the match tray and sends
him out _to sell matches, keeping instead the old

leased last week. the College of

Arts and Sciences has recom- j

mended that the Pass-Fail Option
should be continued. The report al-
so suggests that instructors
should be notified of those stu-

in order to more easily facilitate
grading. This has been suggest-
ed so that the P-F grades could be
administered by machine. This
would greatly increase the grade

This report has been based on

A majority of those people who
attended last Wednesday’s meet-
ing of Pittsburgh’s American Civ-
il Liberties Union (ACLU) indicat-

ed their belief that "the present

Selective Service Law as present-
ly administered and under pres-

ent circumstances is a violation

of civil liberties and constitu-
tional guarantees.”

Military conscription. as well
as direct popular election of the
President. will be considered at
the national board meeting of the
ACLU in Harrisburg. Wednesdays
meeting enabled the general
membership. to express their
views on these topics before the
formulation of national policy.

Mr. Thomas Kerr. Pittsburgh's
representative on the national
board. presented the alternative

-—that all draft board members
receive some training. Accord-
ing to Kerr. members are not
briefed about recent laws and
court decisions which might af-

fect their handling of certain

— cases.

—that a stenographic record be
kept at all draft board meetings.
At present. there are no written
minutes which a man might use
as evidence to appeal his case.

—that at least one-third of draft
board members not be veterans.
On the average, 67 per cent of all
draft board members are veter-
ans.

While some of the ACLU mem-
bers seemed to find revision of
the present draft law inadequate.
all agreed that some change was
necessary.

it ; The Athletic Department came down off the Hill Monday
afternoon to meet the students, and happy to say, the af-
fair was well-attended -— by coaches. '

_ _At no time did the number of students in the Student
' Union Supper Room exceed the number of coaches. Besides
gfour writers from the Pitt News, the Sports Director of
WPGH, and a half—dozen, or so, athletes, no more than a
dozen students stopped in to meet Carl DePasqua, Casimir
.-Myslinski, or any of the other coaches of varsity sports.

__ Students, including this one. do a lot of complaining
bout sports at Pitt. Monday they had a chance to register
their complaints with someone who counted. but as far as
his writer could tell, only one student-
ctually sat down with Mr. Myslinski
nd spoke for any length of time.

,- The other student participation con-
isted mostly of a couple girls who
painted to meet Carl DePasqua and Buzz
idl.

; True. the potential was not there
.5;for students to effect any great chang-
s in the athletic policies at Pitt, but the
ew Athletic Director has continually
estated his desire to meet and speak
ith students.

g  ‘Monday, the students missed an opportunity to open what
=_.._,could have become a meaningful dialogue. Now, more than
never, the Athletic Department will be reluctant to make them-
elves‘ available to students at the students’ convenience.

 -For those who did attend and were already familiar with
e coaches, the affair offered a good opportunity for some :
fr_.iendly chit-chat. Baseball coach Bobby Lewis, for one, kidded'§
ﬁbout how hlS squad would go undefeated if it played all: its
games on basketball courts. — '

 Another coach, currently riding a wave of success, who
spent a_ good deal of time conversing with students was track §
coach Jim Banner. He hardly fit the Captain Bligh image Sports E
Editor Tom Sacks painted of him two years ago.

 It is encouraging to be able to see a coach get a twinkle
1i_1;_his. eye talking about all the great possibilities in the future E
 especially a coach who’s making those possibilities come E

 Sophomore grappler Bob Kuhn has his sights set on a post-
season bowl — a potato chip bowl. that is.

...g According to Kuhn, the trophies for placewinners in the
Eastern wrestling tournament are shaped like bowls. and the largest of
he bowls is just about the size of a potato chip bowl. And the potato
cliip bowl is the one that goes to the Eastern champion.

;{Kuhn, who went undefeated last
ear as a freshman. is currently
-2,in dual meet competition and
-2 ;.overall (including the Ohio
tate quadrangular). Hislonly two
efeats came early in the season.
-to Bob Christianson of Navy and
I _.al1y Strosser of Temple. but Kuhn
eels he can beat them .both if he
ets; another chance.

»A My two toughest matches
I_iis7 season were with Temple
hd Navy. The Navy guy is very
ood, so is the one from Temple.
 ’d like to meet them again and I
5;--_tliink I can beat them,” he ex-
fplained.

 Kuhn wrestled at 160 when he
ost the two matches. but since
moving up to 167 he’s won his last
hree bouts. The latest win was a
ingat Syracuse last week.

 

“When I lost those two match-
es, it was the first time I had
gone down to 160 and I was tired_
from cutting weight. But I like
160 and I'd like to go there in the
Easterns. I wrestled at ' 160
last year and I don‘t have the
strength for 167. But of course it‘s
up to the coach where I’ll go in the
Easterns. I’d rather have the
team place first in the Easterns
than me personally."

Kuhn is anxiously looking for-
ward to the Easterns and he thinks
the varsity has a good chance to
win the crown. “We’re a tourna-
ment team. Five of our sopho-
mores did real well in tourna-
ments last year. And I’m pretty
sure we’ll take second if we don’t
take first,” he added confident-.

Coach Hopes Patcher Shoots
More Against Rain Tonight

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Assistant Sports Editor

Junior forward Mike Patcher is shooting less. but basket-
ball coach Buzz Ridl is not enjoying it more. ,

When the basketball season started. everyone expected Patcher to
contend for the eager scoring title. but the Johnstown native has play-

ed like he had no such goals.

“It’s partly the new team offense and partly my choice." said Pat-
cher. “I think I'd be more of a help to. the team if I look for the pass."

Actually, Patcher is averaging
as many field goalattempts this
season as he did last year as a
first-year varsity man. In fact,
the center converted forward is
also averaging almost a point per
game better than last season’s
7.9 pace. But Ridl had been bank-
ing on much more of an improve-
ment.

"He’s been rebounding real well
this season.” said Ridl. “but he
seems hesitant .-to shoot. Maybe
he’s concerned about fouls. He
draws a lot of fouls and offensive
fouls could hurt his playing time.
Or maybe he’s concerned about
not making them.”

What disturbs Ridl most is that
Patcher has the most moves on
the "squad. “Patch" drives to
the hoop well and shoots with ei-
ther hands.

“He should be more aggres-
sive,” said Ridl concerned. “H_e
has real good moves. We’ll have
to work on him more this week.
Maybe I have to restore his con-
fidence.”

The cagers are going to /need
plenty of good shooting tonight
when they host the Fordham Rams
at the Field House. Fordham in-
vades with a 13-7 record under
new coach Ed Conlin. an ex-Na-
tional Basketball Association ref-
eree.

“It’s not going to be easy,"
said Ridl about the task of beat-
ing the Rams. “We’ll need some
good shooting. a stronger defense.
and most of all». more rebounds.
Sometimes a few rebounds can
make the difference."

Patcher leads the hoopsters
in rebounding, and in fact, has al-
most twice as many as second-
best grabber Jerry Causer.

“Jerry helps me a lot,” admit-
ted Patcher. “He’s the center this
year. so he draws the biggest
man. That takes pressure off me
and gives me a good chance un-
der the boards."

Patcher and the rest of the
cagers will have to do plenty of
jumping against the agile Ford-

obby Kuhn Set For ‘Bowl Bid’

With his personal goal set at
an Eastern championship. Kuhn
feels he should be in his primefor
the tourney coming up March
14-15. Right now he's nursing
a sore shoulder which still pains
him in matches. but other than
that. he plans to be in good shape.

“My biggest asset as a wrest-
ler is my conditioning.” he ex-
plained. “That's what -I rely on
in most of my matches. In the
Easterns when you have to wres-
tle about four of five matches.
I shouldn't tire out as fast as a lot
of guys. And the coach has been

working us out already to start .

getting in shape for the East-
ernsY' ‘

Bob also indicated that he’s
changed his style somewhat since
coming here, especially in learn-
ing new moves. “I’ve learned
more moves last year in three
weeks than I learned all through
high school,” he explained.

And if all goes according to
plans. Bob will be relying on those
moves and his conditioning to
bring home a_ big bowl in a few

ham five. Although they are not at
a real height advantage. the Rams
have some.strong leapers in soph-
omore Charlie Yelverton and jun-
iors Bob Kellert and Ken Crusius.

“They’re real strong,” said
Ridl. “They almost beat St. John’s
Saturday night and they've beaten
George Washington and Army.”

But even the strongest teams
fall. Ridl would like nothing more
than to see Patcher shoot and
drive, and boost the cager‘s scor-
ing punch.

Frosh Fear
Tough Match

With Clarion

After a layoff of nearly a
month, the freshman grap-
plers go after their second
wi-n in three matches, this sea-
son as they play host to a
highly touted frosh squad from
Clarion Friday evening at
7:30.

Clarion handed last year's frosh
their only defeat of the season.
and according to freshman coach

' Bob Fehrs. Clarion is tough again

this season.

"They have a pretty good
team.” he explained, “especially
in the lower weight classes. They
were undefeated two weeks ago
and had beaten Bloomsburg 34-2.
which is a pretty good trouncing.
This will be a real tough match
for us.”

The frosh will wrestle 11 weight
classes Friday, with the addition
of matches at 115 and 191. Greg
Michinac will go at 115, while
Dave Young will move down from
heavyweight to wrestle at 191.
Michinac owns an exhibition
match victory in his only pre-
vious start of the season, while
Young also wasﬁvictorious in his
only contest. Jack Dykes will

' wrestle at heavyweight.

The rest of the frosh line—up
will remain the same as it has
been in the previous matches with
California and Orange County:
Ken Hopes (123). Dave Wiley (130 ).
Lloyd Mason (137). Buddy Smeltz
(145). Joe Schantz (152). Denny
Schirf (160). Jim Fleming (167).
and Willie Saloky (177).

Tankmen Face Grove City Tonight

By MARTIN HELLMAN

The varsity swimming team
wraps up its home schedule
tonight against the tankmen
of Grove City. The meet will
begin at 7:30 in the Trees Hall Pool.

So far this season. the mer-
men have compiled a 2-6 record.
After tonight‘s contest. the only
remaining opponent for the squad
is Kent State University.

The tankmen will be trying” to
avenge last years 66-38 defeat at
the hands of Grove City. However.
Coach Bill Grant expects the meet
to be very tough.

“I’m not quite certain of their
record this year, but I think that
they have been victorious in five
or six of their meets,” he com-
merited.

Because Grove City is not a
member of the ECAC. they will be
allowed to use freshmen in’ the
competition. This will give them
an advantage because Grant can’t
use his frosh. I

"That will make a big differ-
ence in the outcome." Grant said.
“This will give them greater mo-
bility in the crucial events."

The key to the squad’s lack of
success has been its inability‘ to
do well in the freestyle events.
“We just don’t have the strength
in the 50, 200, 500, and 1000 yard
races,” Grant explained.

“If our freest_vlers swim well
against Grove City. I think that

‘we'll have a chance to win.” he

added.

The action has risen to a fev-
erish pitch as the top teams strug-
gle to retain their leads. Recent
competition has seen Litchfield
Manor knock off Madhouse (49-
27). the House of the Rising Sun

(38-31). Litchfield has been led
by the outstanding ., shooting and
rebounding of Rod Fedorchak.

House of the Rising Sun and Suth-
erland each boast 4-1 records.
Sutherland picked up two big wins
in the past two weeks. as they
downed the House of Lords. 51-44.
and the Panther House 41-36.

House of the Rising Sunlost a
crucial contest to Litchfield Man-
or, 40-35, in one of the sloppiest
games of the season, but won
their last two contests, beating a
tough House of Lords team 46-39,
and the Peanuts Gallery 54-36.
Tony Embessi led the Rising Sun

to victory with 12 and 17-point ’

totals.

In other games played during
the past two weeks. Madhouse
squeaked past Panther House.
32-29. Steve Moyer led all scor-
ers with 13. Panther House pick-
ed up their only win of the season

a time rearrangement in the
schedule allowed them to pick up
a forfeit victory ‘at the hands of
the Peanuts Gallery. Wednesday.

ionship game. Right now it's up
for grabs.
