Sestak criticizes Specter’s compromises

Opponent for Specter ’s
Senate seat argues
Specter could have
done more

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak used his visit to

campus yesterday to criticize Sen.
Arlen Specter, his opponent in the

~ race for a Democratic Senate seat,

for “ﬂipping positions” and show-

ing “lack of leadership.”
Sestak spoke in front of more

than 20 students in the William Pitt.

Union as part of an event hosted by
the College Democrats. He spent
about an hour answering students’
questions about his policy posi-
tions, campaign and opponent.
Sestak, who mentioned that he
has worked on health care subcom-
mittees while serving in the U.S.
House of Representatives, called

Specter’s work on the health care V

reform bill “inadequate” and said
that a “real leader” would have

campaigned more actively to shape-

the bill, rather than compromise.
Sestak did not elaborate on Spec-

ter’s compromises.

Representatives for Specter’s
campaign had not returned phone
calls as of press time. .

Sestak criticized Specter for
switching parties, saying, “We
need leadership that is less wor-
ried about keeping their jobs.”

Specter switched from the Re-

’ publican Party to the Democratic

Party at the end of April, amid con-
cerns that he might lose to Repub-

lican challenger Pat Toomey in a '

primary race.

A Rasmussen poll of Republi-
can voters, which was released in
April, showed Toomey with a 20
percent lead over Specter among

likely Republican voters.

of the positions the veteran sena-
tor held during almost 30 years in

700 Pitt affliates contractH1N1lastyear

Despite decline in H1N1 cases in December, Pitt H1N1 expert expects more infections this spring, ,

Diana Bergan
For The Pitt News

About one in every 50 people at Pitt report-
ed having ﬂu—like symptoms last semester,
a ratio experts describe as ordinary.

The University recently announced on
its H1N1 website that more than 700 of the

nearly 33,750 students, faculty, staff and
research associates on Pitt’s Oakland cam-
pus had ﬂu-like symptoms, a possible sign
of H1N1, last semester. Flu-like symptoms,
according to the University’s deﬁnition,
include a fever, cough, sore throat, "runny
or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, chills
and fatigue. A

semester, there were fewer than 10 active
cases of ﬂu-like illness on any day on cam-
pus, the site said.

Dr. Sam Stebbins, director of Pitt’s Cen-
ter for Public Health Preparedness at Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public Health, said other
college campuses ‘reported similar ﬁgures.
He said he expects another wave of H1N1
this spring, during ﬂu season.

Pitt will offer additional H1N1 vaccines
throughout -the month. The University
will offer its ﬁrst free clinic to faculty and
staff from 1 to 5 p.m. Thursday in the Ball-
room of the University Club located at 123
University Place. Students can receive the
vaccine for free at Falk Pharmacy, 3601
Fifth Ave., from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. every

. Tuesday and Thursday through the end
of the month. '

Some students worry about the safety
of the H1N1 vaccine, despite the fact that
the University, like some health agen-
cies, insists that the vaccine is made the
same way as the seasonal ﬂu vaccine and

is therefore safe. , -
Student Elizabeth Hill said she doesn’t

’ plan to get the vaccine.

- “Everyone I know who has had swine ﬂu

has gotten over it somewhat easily, without ’

any serious side effects. Why would I want
to volunteer to put something foreign, into
my body that could potentially have ad-
verse reactions, if not immediately, then
somewhere down the line? Science has been

wron before, and I’m not oin to risk it,” 3
g 3 8

she said.

Pitt’s website notes that some people
—— adults 65 or older, children 5 or younger,
pregnant women and people with chronic
medical conditions —— are at “high risk” of

V developing complications from H1N1.

Many people develop an immunity to
H1N1 after they have it the ﬁrst time. But
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion warns on its website that people with
weakened immune systems might not de-
velop full immunity,’ so they could develop
H1N1 a second time.

Court bans videotaping of Prop 8 trials

U.S. Supreme Court Justices seek to protect witnesses from harassment

David _G. Savage and Carol]. Williams
‘ MCT Campus

WASHINGTON —— The camera.-shy justices
of the U.S. Supreme" Court ordered alhalt
Monday to the‘ planned video coverage
of the San Francisco trial of California’s
Proposition 8. Apparently, concerned
witnesses opposed to gay marriage could
face harassment if they were shown on
YouTube. »

It was the second time in three months
the high court intervened on behalf of
defenders of “traditional marriage.” In
October, the court issued an emergency
order to prevent Washington state offi-
cials from putting online the names of
138,000 citizens who signed ballot peti-
tions seeking to overturn a law giving gays
and lesbians equal beneﬁts. - V

While the justices did not explain their

action Monday, the high court’s order T 1

might also reﬂect a deep—seated reluc-
tance to permit TV coverage of a trial in
federal court. The televised trial of the
0.]. Simpson murder case in Los ‘Angeles
is still cited among the justices when the
topic of cameras in the court arises.

The federal judiciary had a policy of
barring broadcast coverage of all trial
courts. But last month, the independent‘-
minded U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
announced it would experiment with a
“limited use” of cameras in its trial courts.
For several years, the 9th Circuit has per-
mitted TV coverage when it hears some
high—prof1le appeals.

Citing the new order, U.S. Districtjudge

Vaughn Walker in San Francisco said he_

would permit some video coverage of the
trial. He said YouTube could stream the
proceedingsat the end of each day of the

trial. Viewers would watch the proceed-

ings on the Internet. He_also allowed real-
time broadc_asts -at other federal court-
houses.

His move was' welcomed by media

groups and by the lawyers challenging
Proposition 8. They said millions of Cali-
fornians and others across the country
were intensely interested in the courtroom
clash that could shape a national verdict
on whether gays and lesbians have a right
to marry. A l
Conservative bloggers denounced the
move. “JudgeAWalker seems intent on or-
chestrating a show trial,” said Edward
Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public
Policy Center in Washington.‘ _
On Saturday, attorney Charles J. Coo-
per, a Reagan Administration lawyer who
is leading the defense of Proposition 8,
ﬁled an emergency appeal with the high
court in Washington. He argued Judge

   

Walker had ﬂouted the federal rules by
opening the trial to video coverage. And he
insisted his-witnesses could be harassed or
intimidated if their testimony were aired
over the Internet. —

In his response, Ted_Olson, another
Reagan—era veteran who is leading the
challenge to Proposition 8, urged the
justices to stay clear of the dispute. He

noted Cooper and his paid witnesses had
stepped forward on their own to appear
at the trial.

Usually, the highcourt is wary of inter-
vening in a pending case. Under its rules,
it does only when there is a threat of “ir—
reparable harm.” Apparently persuaded

the witnesses faced a potential harm, the .

high court issued a brief order overruling

Palin’s new job a step
out of politics?

hen Sarah Palin resigned
W from office last July, she
alluded to using her new-‘

found free time to help change the
country and assist military members,
according to MSNBC. Interestingly,
stepping down did not cost Palin her
media presence. On the contrary, the
public has been frequently updated
on her latest comments on Twitter.
Over 1 million strong follow her on
Facebook. '

It should not surprise anyone then
that she has signed on as a contribu-
torwith Fox News. Shewill appear on
various network shows, examining
stories of ordinary Americans.

Although some will say Palin has
grounded herself more strongly as

a 2012 presidential candidate, her -

track record might point in another
direction.

Signing onto a few shows com-
menting about American’s lives has
little if any political energy. Com-

pared to Mike Huckabee’s live politi— '

cal dialogue, Palin’s contribution will
not likely unify and invigorate the
Republican Party. It doesn’t appear
to advance the GOP in any way, nor

will it directly change the country.
There might be more tolthis sign-
ing than a political outlook will lead

one to believe. It’s necessary to un- .

derstand Palin as a person and not a
politician to appreciate the meaning
of this new deal. I

Palin has a historylofbeinga pub— ‘

lic ﬁgure, a person who can charm. In
1984, she won the Miss Wasilla pag-
eant and ﬁnished third in the Miss
Alaska pageant. Her book, “Going
Rogue,” topped.the New York Times
Bestseller List the ﬁrst week of De-
cember2009. Her education was in
communications and journalism. In
the 1980s she worked as apart-time
sports presenter for the KTUU sta-
tion in Anchorage, Alaska. ’

This new career direction.might
be her calling. A 2012 presidential
bid is not impossible, but it does not
ﬁt the type of person she has shown
to be. This new deal does.

Perhaps her resignation is more
understandable considering Palin’s

. celebrity status. Alaska became too

small for her after heavy exposure
and publicity during her vice presi-

dential bid. A network like Fox News

and its correspondingviewing com-
munity are more her realm.

This new position comes with
numerous beneﬁts. She will delight
Republicans _as she always has and

upset Democrats with her disdain

of their initiatives. Palin will only

~ increase the networlés ratings. Ad—-

ditionally, Palin can hone her ora-
tory and public speaking skills on
such a show. _

If a faction of the Republican
Party felt Palin was dragging down
the 2008 GOP ticket, it may have had
some merit. Though Sarah Palin is
not lacking in skill, she needed the
right ground to sow her ideas.

Considering the public’s recep-
tion of the former governor of Alaska
publicly, it is clear America might
not consider her a politician, but
an idol. Given the right focus and

-the right content, Palin might be a

strong asset to the GOP from her
stage on Fox News. ‘
She might not have to be an actual

candidate, but with time, Palin can t

sway and shape opinion, priming
America for a Republican candidacy,
whoever it may be, in 2012.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

Your editorial on President Obama’s education proposals (“Edito-
rial: Education plan a smart choice,” Jan. 11) demonstrates the same
naive optimism that propelled the junior senator from Illinois to the ’

White House.

In place of dealing with the real concerns, Obama is attempting to
“hope” us to a better education system. .

Universities pledge to broaden enrollment in their education pro-
grams — wonderﬁil, except that it is a quantitative solution in place of
a qualitative one-. It’s reminiscent of a joke from Woody Allen’s “Annie
Hall,” in which two women are conversing at a resort:-“Boy, the food
at this place is really terrible,” says one. The other one replies, “Yeah,
I know, and such small portions.”

President Obama" and the Congressional Democrats have demon-
strated a complete unwillingness to address a major factor in the poor
performance of America’s’ education system — teachers’ unions.

An article in the Americanjournal of Political Science by Terry Moe
concluded, “Collective bargaining appears to have a strongly negative
impact [on children’s education] in the larger [school] districts,” par-
ticularly noting the effects on minority populations.

Instead of taking these conclusions to heart, Congressional Demo-

crats, beholden to the teachers’ unions, killed the funding for the D.C. I

Voucher program. The program had marked success in improving
children’s safety and parental satisfaction with the education of their
offspring.

If Barack Obama really wants to improve our education system,
he’ll stop catering to the destructive teachers’ unions, devise ways
of helping schools reward good teachers while expurgating bad ones
from the system and foster an environment in which charter school
programs, such as the one in Washington, can ﬂourish. ’

In the meantime, all we have is “hope” that we can create better
teachers without a system of proper rewards. Why don’t we just start
up the backyard furnaces and band together for a Great Leap Forward
while we’re at it? '

Exhibit unveils art in modern forms

“Behind Our Scenes”
SPACE Gallery

812 Liberty Ave.

A precise and ﬁnal stroke of the
brush, alast click of the mouse anda
few quick swipes with the eraser. The
artist steps back from her work. She
nods her head and smiles with satis-
faction. The piece is ﬁnally complete
—- the work is done.

But forthe curators, installers and
attendees who make possible the dis-
plays that patrons and art enthusiasts
enjoy, the work has only just begun.

“Behind Our Scenes,” the latest
exhibit at SPACE gallery, takes the
visions of those typically working
in the wings and thrusts them into
the spotlight.

“Behind Our Scenes” hopes to
give backstage artists the chance to
show off and get some recognition
for their own work.

The exhibit features creations
from art installers to curators and
customer service representatives of
six prominent Pittsburgh artvenues,
including The Mattress Factory, the
Carnegie Museum of Art and the

' Wood Street Galleries, of which

SPACE is a constituent. ‘
The pieces on display range from

drawings and paintings to photogra-
phy and new media installations.
Chris Korch, an attendee and
installer at the Wood Street Galler-
ies known to the art community as
“Slinky,” is one of me artists respon-

, sible for “Behind Our Scenes.

Korch contributed three pieces
to the exhibit. One of these is a col-
lection of traﬂic signs titled “Street
Art.” .

“This piece is the opposite of art
that people create in the stree ,”
Korch said. “I’m taking the quote
unquote ‘art’ from the streets and
bringing it into the gallery.”

Also fashioned by Korchis aseries
of origami called “It Never Comes
True.” Organized into two squares
on the ﬂoor, one large and one small,

Korch created a sea of crisp white .
“fortune~tellers,” as he described '

them.

“We used to make these when
we were kids, and the fortunes were
always about who you were going
to marry and things like that. It’s
called ‘It Never Comes True’ because
none of the predictions made ever
came true,” Korch said. “This piece
is sort of about unrequited love if
you will.” I

The ﬁnal piece by Korch is asculp-
ture created from empty CD jewel
cases that Korch, a part—time disc
jockey, had available. The cases are
stacked and hung to create an overall
impression of a swirl shape. Most
of them are plain and empty, but a
few still have the barcode stickers
attached, while a couple others are
stamped with handwriting.

“This piece is called ‘Disintegra-
tion’ because it is about the erosion of
the music industry and the way mp3s
are replacing CDs,” Korch said.

“As a DJ, it’s distressing to me to
see this because the sound quality of
mp3s isn’t very good, and you don’t
get the artwork you do with CDs,” he
said. “With a lot of the music I like,
the artwork is just as important to
me as the music. Now, you can’t even
buy these jewel cases. They’re going
extin ” .

Ian Brill, another Wood Street
employee, also has work on display

in “Behind Our Scenes.” .
“When I got the idea forthis piece,
a I was kind of worn down by the in-
stalling process,” said Brill. “There’s
this painting, ‘The Raft of Medusa,’
where everything is just mayhem 

that’s the image I get when I think of

, installing.”
Brill’s contribution to the exhibit is
avideo installation titled “After Géri-

cault (How Many Preparators Does it I

Take to Screw in a Light Bulb).”

The piece consists of a projector
casting on awhite screen the images
of people moving around. It instills

an eerie feeling of omnipresence to
the onlooker and suggests an overlap
of various dimensions as the trans-
lucent people ﬂit around, in and

Surfing while driving: in- dash tech

Advanced dashboard computers poised to enhance the driving experience, but at what cost to user safety?

Donald Campbell
Columnist

 

Drivers pretty much agree that it is unac-
ceptable to set up a laptop in the front seat

and surf Wikipedia while driving along the '

parkway.
The government insists that “texting”
while driving is a big no-no, and some states

- have even banned the use of cell phones with-

But car companies have realized that
despite the impetus to reduce distractions
while driving, car buyers want more and
more interactive content to integrate into
their driving experience. The American pub-
lic no longer wants just an AM radio in the
dashboard. 

Drivers want to be able to pull up informa-
tion about their destinations and want their
cars to suggest particular destinations.

If you’re hungry while driving, you do,

after all, want the most gourmet food on the
market, and it would be fantastic if your Audi
could point you in the right direction.

A recent article in The New York Times
describes several of the somewhat startling
new trends in automotive computing that are
being showcased at the Consumer Electron-
ics Show in New York.

Many of the new trends appear to be
aimed at those of us who would just love to
drive around with a laptop sitting on the pas-
senger seat, save for the fact that it’s probably

illegal. For those people, the car companies
simply moved the laptop to the dashboard.
The systems, labeled “infotainment

 systems,” range in complexity and safety

features and span all price ranges of cars.
Luxury car companies, logically, will pro-
vide the most complex and ﬂashy systems.
More moderately priced companies, namely
Ford, will also provide dashboard computer
systems. '

Some of the systems allow drivers to
pull up Wikipedia articles and text content

while the car is in motion. They
rely on a warning message that asks
the driver to use discretion when
choosing a time to load articles to
maintain safety.

Others, like MyFord —— Ford’s
in-dash computer system —- pre-
vent users from surﬁng the Web un-
til the car is stopped and the driver
-successfully shifts to park.

So what started this apparent
revolution of including computer
systems in cars? ‘

As with most trends in the
computer industry, the increasing
abundance and decreasing overall
cost of computer chips has a major
impact. When computer chips were
at a premium, computers in cars
were reserved for only the most
importance tasks, such as fuel in-
jection, door locks and windows.

But as chips become more inex-
pensive, larger and more complex
computers can be added to the car
to take care of those “nice-to_-have”
features many drivers long for.

Chips will only get cheaper,
and the computers that automo-
bile manufacturers can include

in dashboards will only get more
complex.

- This, of course, causes a prob-
lem. At what point do the dangers
posed by driver distraction out-
weigh the “awesome” factor of hav-
ing an Internet-enabled vehicle?

 

. Car companies might
have to get clever in
their safety checks.

An Audi A8 can be a deadly‘

weapon if the driver is moving 70
miles per hour and is engrossed in
a scholarly exposé on Pittsburgh’s
various venues for interpretive
dance.

A nice balance will probably
need to be met  eventually.

vide some services that are safe,
especially when coupled with inno-
vations like the automotive heads-
up display.

Heads-up displays presentin-
formation to users at eye level, al-
lowing them to review information
without taking their eyes off the

. road ahead ofthem. Some in-dash ’

computer systems might actually
improve safety.

A car computer that allows easy
and hands—free calling services,
similar to the OnStar service of
General Motors, could let people
keep a hand on the steering wheel
to make a phone call. Voice-acti-
vated commands could similarly
remove the need for texting while
driving.

Using the Internetlwhile driving
might cause some problems, how-
ever. If drivers insist upon desiring
the Internet above the radio, car
companies might have to get clever
in their safety checks.

I personally don’t see the value
in having Wikipedia in my dash-

board. ,I use computers too much _

as it is.

Contra arrives

Vampire Weekend hits the right note with album

Vampire Weekend — Contra

Label: XL Recordings
Rocks Like: Discovery

' Vampire Weekend returns with
Contra this week. Rest assured, the
band’s still worth the hype; they wear
preppy menswear, do theirquirkyvideo
thingand singaboutprivate school and
obscurely named beverages with the
bestof them. ,

new ears as they listened to Africana-
inﬂuenced prepster rock.

Contra carries more of a beat than
the band’s self—titled debut album, with
vocalstakingabackseatto heavy synth
and piano on tracks like “Taxi Cab,”

The album takes on something of
Discovery, keyboardist Rostam Bat-
manglifs side projectwith Ra Ra Riot’s
Wesley Miles that provides a fresh,
beat-laden take on R&B. But Vampire
Weekend’s “ un,” with its use ofbrsxas
instruments, could easily be a Ra Ra
Riot tunen. ,

The band never copies a style, in-
stead combining it with an unlikely
sound, rhythm or lyric that makes an
oldtrick sound new. Vampire Weekend
masters the blend by layering banne-
nies and beats into music that’s end-
lessly compelling. It has the appeal of
poppy ﬂuif with the intelligence of the
most complex pieces. That’s not easily
done.

Partthers’ losses frustrate, eyes orLSurLday

Pitt hopes to redeem itselfin WVU game after women’s baske<tball’s 52-46’ loss to Rutgers capped series of Big East losses V

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

“You cannotwin when you shoot 29
percent from the ﬁeld and turn the
ball over 21 times in one game.”

_ These statistics, said by head
coach Agnus Berenato, are not a
recipe for success in the game of
basketball.

Yet the Panthers posted these

numbers in their 52-46 loss to Rut-
gers. With this loss, the Panthers ex-
tended their losing streak to three
games, all of which were Big East
conference contests. .

The 11-5 Panthers lost to Mar-
quette and West Virginia on the road
and dropped their Big East home
opener to Rutgers on Sunday.

It’s easy for ateam to experience
arough patch inthe seasonwhenthe
shots aren’t falling and ball control
is an issue.

 But the Panthers seem stuck in

. that patch, and both coaches and

players recognize the need to re-
inforce fundamental concepts and
strategies.

The Panthers won’t play again
until this Sunday, when they take
on a nationally ranked Westvirginia
team that handed Pitt its second Big
East loss of the season.

While Berenato jokingly claimed
that the week off would give her

Lucas'Felak| STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Head coach Agnus Berenato, here with Shawnice “Pepper”_Wilson
and Chelsea Cole, said that the Panthers have struggled to ﬁnd some-
body to step up and make a crucial shot.

“seven days to be miserable because
of the loss,” she said that the break
could be beneﬁcial for her players by

_ giving them an opportunity to take

a step back.

“These ladies will get a rest for
a few days, and then we can come
backinandwork on some things that

have to do withus and our struggles,”

Berenato said. —
Junior guardjania Sims said sh

also realized the need for improve-

ment in the Panthers’ play, which she

admitted has been unsatisfactory.

“Coach Berenato is always tell-
ing us that little things make the big
things happen, but we are not do-
ing those little things,” Sims said.
“We may even have become a little
passive.” ’ S .

Two of those “little things,” ac-
cording to Berenato, are a desire for
victory on the court and the willing-
ness to take responsibility when the

gameis tight.

In the closing seconds of the

Rutgers game, the Panthers gained
possession of the ball while trail-

ing 46-48, but no one wanted to

shoot the ball. The confusion led to
atumover andanensuingfreethrow
for Rutgers, extending the Scarlet
Knights’ lead.._

“I really thought, at that time,

T that we were where we wanted to

be and that we were going to win,”
Berenato said. “Somebody neededto

step up and take the shot, but it did
not look like anybody wanted to.”
This hesitation on offense led the
Panthers to settle for outside shots
as the shot clock expired, resulting
in low-percentage opportunities
and a corresponding low ﬁeld goal
percentage. — ‘
Turnovers also plagued the Pan-
thers in each of their losses this sea-

son.In all ﬁve defeats, the Panthers ‘
T committed more turnovers than the

opposition, and against Rutgers,
each Pitt player contributed a tum-
Qver to the team total of 21.

Inthe Big East conference, there
is little leeway for slumps such as
the one the»Panthers are currently
experiencing. With three upcoming
opponents -—— Connecticut, WestVir-
giniaand Notre Dame—intheAsso-
ciated Press Top 25 poll, the Panthers
do not have an easy schedule ahead
of them. ‘+ V

Berenato, who called the Big East
“the best conference in the nation,”
has a message that she wants her
players to understand and take to
heart, especially during their upcom-
ing practices. ' . .

“We need to stress getting bet-

ter every day, and we need to know .

where we want to go,” she said.

The Panthers will look to re-
bound when they host West Virginia
on Sundayin an afternoon game that
tips off at 4 p.m.
