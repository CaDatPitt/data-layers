James Holobaugh spoke of army discrimination against him.

Gay ex-ROT C cadet
ﬁghting DOD policy

By Scot Ross and

Jennifer Calabrese
The Pitt News

James Holobaugh was an Army ROTC cadet who was second
in command in his battalion at Washington University in St.
Louis. He was about to be commissioned a second lieutenant
in the Army. As a cadet on full scholarship, Holobaugh’s picture
had appeared in nationwide ROTC recruiting material.

Then in April of 1989 Holobaugh’s admittance that he was
gay led to his dismissal and a later demand that he pay back the
$25,000 scholarship ROTC had given him.

“Unfortunately I found out a year ago that my abilities and my
performance didn’t really matter near as much to the military
as my sexual orientation does,” Holobaugh said.

“This really surprised me because I could understand why
they would ask me to repay the scholarship if I had flunked out
of school or done something that was my fault. But I really
didn’t have any choice about this. I didn’t really have any say
in it The only choice I made was to be honest about it,”
Holobaugh told a Pitt audience last night in a program
sponsored by the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

The military’s policy stating that “homosexuality is
incompatible with military service” caused Holobaugh’s
dismissal. His case caught national media attention, and the
Army eventually backed down from demanding the scholarship
reimbursement.

“The military takes great pride in equal opportunity but still
discriminates on sexual orientation," Holobaugh said.

Holobaugh’s case was the impetus for a movement to remove
Washington’s ROTC from campus. Washington, like many
other universities around the country, including Pitt, has a
policy protecting people from discrimination based on their
sexual preference.

When an audience member asked Holobaugh if he thought
it was fair to students who receive ROTC scholarships to

Vendors petition City Council

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

A campus vendor is asking the
Pitt community to support a

"Pittsburgh City Council bill that

would allow city vendors to move
their stands shorter distances.
Charles Bonasorte, owner and
operator of the Pittsburgh Stop,
located at the intersection of
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard, has been circulating
petitions since Sunday. The signed
petitions will be sent to City
Council at the end of the week.
“This is the chance for the
students to speak,” said
Bonasorte. “Do the students want
vendors on campus? If they do,
they should come down [to my
stand] and sign the petition.”
Under a current city ordinance,

vendors must move their stands
every half hour. A regulation
Written by the city building-
inspections bureau prevents
vendors from operating their
stands in the same block face
within a four-hour period. The
bureau considers both sides of a
street to be a single block face.

To comply, a vendor must be
at a new block face every half
hour, which Bonasorte, a Pitt
sportswear vendor, said would
make it difficult for his customers
to find him. 9

The bill, sponsored by City
Council member Michael Coyne,
will modify the bureau's
regulation.

“[Part of the bill] is to specify a
block face,” said Coyne. “A block
face should be one side of a
street, not both.” Theoretically

the bill would allow vendors to-
comply by moving across the
street.

Coyne plans to meet with the
vendors’ attorneys and members
of Pittsburgh’s Chamber of
Commerce and the Golden
Triangle Association, a group of
city building owners and
managers, to modify the bill.

“I’d rather see a bill that is
workable for both sides,” said
Coyne.

Dominick Cimino, chief of the
building-inspectors bureau, said
that he already has been receiving
complaints about the bill.

“I know for a fact that there is
a lot of opposition to the
[proposed] ordinance,” said
Cimino. “The way the ordinance
is written now, it does not permit

Lynn Hayes-Freeland, now the host and producer

I of “The Lynn Hayes—Freeland Show,” started working

as a secretary for KDKA-TV’s “Evening Magazine”
during her senior year at Dusquesne University.

But she knew she didn’t want to remain a
secretary.

After a few months she had developed an interest
in field producing. She began going to work at 6
a.m. in order to finish her secretarial duties by 9
a.m. Then she would “look over the ﬁeld producers’
shoulders to learn what they did,” she said.

When she asked her employers to let her try her
hand at ﬁeld production, “They said, ‘we’ll let you
try it. We’re not going to pay you, but we'll see how
it goes,’” she said.

She started producing “Vibrations” and created
“Weekend Magazine.”

She then became interested in anchoring. Again
KDKA-TV station management told her they would
give her a trial without pay, and she began anchoring
“Vibrations.”

Since December 1989 when KDKA-TV was
revamped, the station’s new management has

Fair. .

Tene’ Croom, a Sheridan Broadcasting Network
news reporter, said she “never intended to be in
radio.”

But she accepted a job as a disc jockey to make
extra money 12 years ago during college and has
been in radio ever since.

She became news director, but she was still
working as a DJ. because the station was small and
under—staffed.

Eventually she reached a point in her career
where she felt she should choose between news
and disc jockeying.

“I’m very happy I chose news,” she said.

Croom now serves as secretary of the Pittsburgh
Black Media Federation.

“It’s very important for you to get the internship
— get the experience,” she said.

Peace Corps returns to campus

By Howard Goodman
Staff Wﬁter

Operations for the Peace Corp
at Pitt have resumed following
the appointment of a new on-
campus recruiter.

The former on-campus
recruiter, Shawn Wright, had
fulﬁlled his contract and left Pitt
to go to France to pursue a career
in international law. Gwen Allen,
a former Peace Corps volunteer,
has been chosen to replace
Wright.

“I will be actively recruiting
students for Peace Corps
programs. There is a genuine
interest which needs to be
explored,” Allen said.

Allen, who worked for two

years in Costa Rica, said “I joined
the Peace Corps because it was
an excellent career move. The
experience in small business
development and the adventure
in Costa Rica were worthwhile.”

Volunteering to work for the
Peace Corps in a foreign country
is not like everyone thinks it is,
said Allen.

“It was very professional. We
had to often dress up for business
meetings. There are differentsides
to the work,” she said.

Before Allen was hired, the
Peace Corps planned local
informational sessions for Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon and Chatham
College. Conferences took place
at Pitt on Monday and Tuesday.

At the first session recruiter

Sherlene McCarther, an 11-year
employee of the Peace Corps,
described the procedures of
joining and working for the Peace
Corps.

Both Allen and she "agreed that
the thorough application process
helps individuals decide if they
really are interested in
volunteering.

After they are accepted, there
is a paid three month training
session before the two-year
enlistment begins.

Upon returning after the two-
year period there are many
advantages for Peace Corps
volunteers, she said. According
to McCarther there is a job hot
line for employment. For those

CLEAN turning to bumanitczriozn pmgbose

By Marietta Pacella
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

Concerned Leaders for
Environmental Action Now is
conjuring up new ideas and
planning to make major changes
in its role On campus and in the
outside community.

“Those who originated CLEAN
are no longer here, and the group
is now in the processgof changing
and broadening,” said Kathleen
Iducovitch, a representative of
CLEAN.

“We are working to become
more of a humanitarian group
rather ’ than simply an
environmental group. We have

« been discussing the rewriting Of

our constitution," she said.
According to Iducovitch, the

group members have learned a

great deal since their attendance

at this year’s Student
Environmental Conference at the
University of Illinois, and they
are hoping to incorporate this
new knowledge into future
projects and activities.

Iducovitch said, “It was very
inspiring to see 7,000 students at
the conference. It lasted three
days, and there were Over 100
workshops from to to choose
three. It was a real rush.”

SEC is a year—Old, nationwide
group which holds conferences
for environmentalist groups and
individuals to attend. Speakers
such as Jesse Jackson and Robert
Redford were in attendance at
this year’s conference. SEC has a
chapter in Pittsburgh, and CLEAN
is also a part of SEC. —

“Eight CLEAN members
attended this year [and last year
as well]. Each time we go, we

learn so much. There are so many
speakers, and you can learn so

much from them, ” said
Iducovitch.
“I think speakers and fact sheets

are very effective in learning more
about the environment and how
we can do our share to contribute
to [its preservation]. We would
like to sponsor more speakers
and distribute fact sheets
throughout the campus and the
[Outside] community,” she said.

CLEAN has been registered as
a campus organization for
approximately a year and a half,
and so far the group has
conducted three clean-ups at
Schenley Park, set up information
booths and sponsored several
speakers on environmental issues
at its biweekly meetings.

CLEAN holds its meetings every
other week on interchangeable

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 24, 1990

Mondays and Tuesdays in Room
204 in the Cathedral of Learning.
The group's next meeting will be
held On Monday, Oct. 29.

According to Iducovitch, 30 to
40 people attend the meetings.
Only 10 to 15 faces are the same
each time, she said.

“Attendance fluctuates. We are
always seeing new faces,” she
said.

“We do a lot of letter writing at
our meetings. We have written to
Pennsylvania senators [Arlen]
Specter and [John] Heinz, and
recently we have been writing to
the government to get them to
cut down on spending for the
military. We do a lot Of letter

Researcher measure

By Jim Wechsler
saw‘ Writer

Sequestered in Scaife Hall and
surrounded by scaffolding and
construction equipment, the
newly appointed vice chairperson
of research in the department of
orthopedic surgery is hard at work
on some construction of his own.

“I think my No. 1 job here is to
create an orthopedic- research
program,” said Dr. Savio Woo,
the man in the driver’s seat of the
University of Pittsburgh medical
school’s latest enterprising
project. “The other major
endeavor that I would like to do
is help establish a bio—engineering
program.”

Woo said that the department
currently has 1 5 faculty members,
each with his or her own specific
area of interest. As vice
chairperson of research he said

he ﬁnds it important to develop.

those interests within the faculty,
realizing that not every aspec
can be covered. '

“I will be recruiting new basic-
science faculty,” he said.

By adding new faculty and
tapping the resources of existing
faculty, Woo said that he hopes
to put together a package that
will make Pitt’s orthopedic-
research program more visible
on the national scene. Woo said
that he was concerned about the
overshadowing reputation of
Carnegie Institute of T echno1ogy’s
biomedical engineering program
but added that he accepted his
appointment at Pitt because Pitt’s
program is young and exciting.

the

department chairperson, said,
“The department of orthopedic
surgery is seeking to become
more global in its research and to
bring basic- science initiatives
into balance with its excellent
clinical programs.

“Woo’s distinguished and
productive career in orthopedic
research makes him the ideal
candidate to lead this endeavor,”
he added.

Woobrings with him$1,673,S00
in total research grants. His current
research project involves soft
connective tissue, such as
ligaments and tendons.

He said that today’s societies
are far more active than in past
years, and that there will therefore
be more strains, sprains and tears
in this tissue. He is interested in
how the tissue heals and how to
speed up the healing process but
also seeks to collect baseline data,
which includes the age at which
the tissue matures and the effects
of use and disuse on the tissue.

Woo and his research team
intend to investigate these and
other questions from a multi-
disciplinary point of view.

This work and earlier efforts by
Woo and his team have led to a
string of awards from the
American Orthopedic Society for
Sports Medicine and other‘
distinguished organizations. But
Woo said he measures his
accomplishments by the
achievements of his students,
some of whom now have research
departments of their own.

“Start them early,” Woo said of
his views on getting

undergraduates, graduate
students and clinical colleagues.
He said that early exposure to
clinical research will help students
to see the relevancy of basic-
level theories and procedures.

“I think it’s a good experience
for them,” Woo said.

Woo came to America in 1961
at the age of 18 to get an
education. He said that he hoped
an American education would
give him an edge on the
competition in Hong Kong, his
place of birth.

Woo attended Chico State
College and then went on to
graduate work at the University
of Washington, where he received
his doctorate in biomechanics
from the department of
mechanical engineering. At the
time, there was not a degree in
bio—engineering.

choosing to go back to school for
a master's degree there is ﬁnancial
assistance available at many
prestigious colleges.

Allen said, “I know volunteers
who had their entire master's-
degree program paid for at
Harvard, Columbia and even here
at Pitt."

“The volunteer is also exempt
for one year for taking entrance
exams for civil-service jobs,” said
McCarther. *

“Employers in internationally
related ﬁelds readily hire former
Peace Corps volunteers due to
their interest and knowledge in
foreign cultures,” said Allen. “This
is because there is no better
experience of international
careers.” ,

According to McCarther, during
the actual two-year service period
there are monthly living

allowances paid to the volunteer
by the Peace Corps. “This amount
depends upon the economy of
the country," she said.

Allen said, “This amount may
seem poor in relation to United
States standards, but in the country
it will be better than many of the
citizens lmakel.”

McCarther said, “Most
importantly the Peace Corps has
an oral, not written, commitment.
If a volunteer decides that this is
wrong for them they may leave at
any time, and all travel expenses
will be paid by the Peace Corps.”

Allen said coming back to the
United States is always a culture
shock to the volunteer.

“The volunteer is much more
observant to ordinary
happenings.” Watching people
socialize in the mall was different,
and some things were quite funny,
she said.

remove ROTC from campus, he said, “I support it if it is going
to be phased out If it is started now, it could be gone by 1994,
and the people presently on scholarship would not be hurt.”

In April Pitt created a University Senate committee to study
the conﬂict between the military’s policy and Pitt's policy
against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

Holobaugh has graduated and now holds a full—time job. He
said that he spends as much time as possible visiting college
campuses to speak against the discrimination in the ROTC.

“I am speaking on college campuses because it is a new
voice. Hopefully it will drum up support so that the policy will
be changed,” Holobaugh said. “It will take the cooperation of
the universities, society and the government to bring about the
change.”

Holobaugh said that he does not regret his decision to admit
that he was gay. He also said that the rnilitary’s policy promotes
homophobic attitudes in society.

“The military won't change until society changes," he said. '

Holobaugh gave gays in the military some advice.
“If you are gay and in the military, keep your mouth shut if
you want a military career,” he said.

Cimino cited obstruction of
pedestrian traffic and potential
hazards for the blind as reasons
why vendors should not be
stationary. Of Bonasorte’s stand,
Cimino said that it “could have a
tendency to obstruct trafﬁc.”

“Transporting his cart across
the street [when he moves] could
cause a halt [of trafﬁcl,” he said.

Bonasorte has already collected
more than 800 signatures and
will continue to circulate his

was not aware of the petition, he
tried to put it in perspective.

“I think it would be taken into
consideration [by City Council]
that the student. population

show an acceptance of Mr.

HEY BUDDY, THAT '5
THE BIGGEST DARN NOSE
I EVER SEEN‘.

Jake had shot his mouth off once too often.

Oct. 22 — A female Pitt student
5 reported that her jacket was stolen

 
 

I from the back of her chair in the

Towers’ cafeteria while she was
getting a beverage. The student
stated that she saw another
student wearing an :1 identical
jacket. When she questioned the
suspect, the suspect became very
defensive. The jacket is valued at
$300. .
Oct. 22 —-— A female Pitt student
was accidentally kicked too hard
during a controlled exercise in
karate class. She was taken to
Presbyterian University Hospital
by her instructor.

Oct. 23 — Police responded to
a call to check a broken window
on the bridge that crosses Forbes
Avenue. Witnesses stated that they
were walking across the bridge
when they heard a loud noise
like a gunshot. Police inspected
the window and found that the

hole was made by a screwdriver- I

type object.

Oct. 23 — Police discovered a
man lying on the ground in the
South Oakland area. The man
was very intoxicated, and police
could not find out where the man
was supposed to spend the night.

The man was arrested because

he was a danger to himself.

you like to go to New York?’ I was

went to New. York, then to
Washington D.C., where he
became an anchorperson on a

When he learned of an opening
at KDKA-TV, “I dropped the news

    Ta/ee Haferls ad oﬁ TV ..

In any situation, rape is a hideous crime that should not
be used lightly in advertisements. Republican gubernatorial

candidate Barbara Hafer, however, has crossed the

boundary of good taste with her new campaign
advertisement.

Yesterday, Hafer released an ad juxtaposing a picture of
Gov. Robert Casey with a dramatized rape. The commercial
shows a man attacking a woman in a Philadelphia side

‘ street.

I As Casey's photograph is brought onto the screen, a
narrator says, “Manywomen in Pennsylvania are scared

- and ‘with good reason. Because Gov. Bob Casey is

committed to Toutlawing abortions, even for victims of
‘rape and incest.” During the attack the woman screams

,’ twice. The ad then returns to Hafer, who is talking to an
A audience about her experiences as a nurse. _

Hafer’s advertising campaign is an attempt to turn the

_ gubernatorial race into a fight for abortion rights. While

Hafer supports the right of a woman to have an abortion,
Casey has openly stated that he will sign any bill which
would outlaw abortion, as long as there was an exception

I for abortions which are necessary to save the life of the

mother. ~

’ Hafer, who is desperately behind in the polls, needs
something to, get her back in the race. Her ad is just
another ploy to attract attention to abortion rights, not her

' own qualifications for governor.

But this campaign tactic has gone over the line. The way
the ad is stated, it pays more attention to the crime in the
background than the future of abortion rights in
Pennsylvania. . '

I Hafer intends to promote heavy airplay of this
commercial. In a heavily Democratic state; it could
possibly help her gain popularity. .

’With this ad, however, Hafer could also give her
chances a death blow. On an issue where party platforms
are reversed, Hafer could possibly alienate those in her
own party who support the pro-life movement.

The Pitt News recently endorsed Hafer solely. because of

her pro—choice stance. But Hafer’s tactic of portraying a

rape on the air is a bad move. This commercial is in poor
taste and should be discontinued immediately.

The defense of Lisa Campoli

I am writing regarding The Pitt
News’ coverage of the Lisa
Campoli nomination as
undergraduate representative on
the presidential-search
Committee, particularly the

publication of Doug Li gons’ letter V

to Julie Shepard in the Oct. 23
issue. I feel that the coverage has
been biased and unfair to a truly
qualiﬁed candidate.

First, Mr. Ligons argues that
Campoli is unqualiﬁed, mostly
because of her sophomore status
and supposed lack of knowledge
of the concerns of special—interest

groups like the Black Action '

Society. This issue of
qualifications can be addressed
by a candid question to Mr. Ligons:
If a black sophomore with the
same qualifications as Ms.
Campoli had been nominated by
Ms. Shepard, would the BAS have
raised the same arguments about
his/her competency? I sincerely
doubt it. ’[..;]

Much print in The PittNews has
been devoted to the supposed
lack of qualifications of Ms.
Campoli. However, scarcely two
paragraphs have appeared
relating to her excellent
credentials, her familiarity with
the governance process at the
university and her diligence. I
have worked with Ms. Campoli

as editor of The Pittsburgh

Undergraduate Reviewsince early
in her freshman year. She is
especially‘ mature for ‘ a
sophomore, showing more tact
and good sense than many
seniors. (As a senior, I include
myself here.) She is a diligent,
conscientious woman who is able
to address the diverse concerns

of the student body.l...]

Campus should be thankful
’ This is in response to the act of
immaturity on the part of F.

Douglas Ligons, chairman of the

Black Action Society's steering

committee. He wrote letters to
John Marous, chairman of the
university, and Julie Shepard, _
president of the Student
Government Board, whining that
the BAS did not get its fair
representation ~‘ on the
presidential-search committeel. ..l
I think Mr. Ligons and the rest

of the university community who
think they are “owed”
representation in selecting a new
president should be set straight.
First of all, I think it was VERY
generous for chairman Marous to
open the selection process to
those outside the Board of
T mstees in general, let alone allow
an undergraduate student to
participate. He ,_didn’t have to do

this. In fact, the Board of Trustees
is an autonomous group; they
have the authoriw to do anything
they want with the university,

our concerns[...l

Ligons’ attacks faulty

In their letters to Chairman
Marous and Student Government
Board President Julie Shepard of
Oct. 18, the Black Action Society
unilaterally demanded the
resignation of Lisa Campoli
without recourse to discussion or
compromise. While their
complaints concerning the
number of undergraduate seats
on the committee are legitimate,
the personal attacks on Ms.
Campoli and Ms. Shepard are
ungrounded and based on
basically erroneous assumptions.
Mr. Ligons states that “from our
point of view only whites and
possibly white women will have
representation on the
presidential-search committee." It
is quite a narrow-minded point

of view that stresses only the race
or sex of an individual and
excludes the possibility of that
individual representing the needs
of those of a different race or sex.
Mr. Ligons goes on to attack the
SGB president by contending
“that she is not representative of
the student body, and in fact [is]
only representative of the one-
seventh of the undergraduate
students that voted for her.” Ms.
Julie Shepard, however, is in fact
the SGB president, given that
office by a fair election [. . .1 Would
an SGB president from the 7 to 9
percent of the student population
which Mr. Ligons represents be
less unrepresentative or even
more qualified thanJu1ie Shepard?
Apparently the student body felt
not when they placed Ms. Shepard
in her ofﬁce last year.

The BAS representative also
writes that “other governance
groups should have been
consulted on this matter.” [...l It is
hardly likely that the steering
committee of the Black Action
Society consulted each and every
member of their organization
before writing these letters but
rather acted with the authority
given to them by their
constituents[...l

Michael Sentner

CA5 ’91

Blame the Trustees
Over the past few weeks, I’ve
read with interest stories of the
furor caused by Lisa Campoli’s
appointment to the presidential-
search committee. It strikes me
that by blaming everything on
the SGB, people have misplaced
their anger. Perhaps'Ms. Shepard
-was in error when she made her
appointment without consulting
various campus groups. The
larger issue in my estimation,
though, is the administration’s
attitude toward the idea of student
representation. With only one
student on a committee of 22,
-isn't it clear that this is a token

position?[...l

imi the Big East: a mate  in heaven?

Pitt and the Miami Hurricanes may spend even more time bickering on the ﬁeld in the future if the two Big East members become part of the same football conference.

What a windfall  The Big East, once
simply a bunch of northeastern schools,
has gone coastal with the addition of the
University of Miami as a member. This can
only be described as a win-win scenario.

For Pitt, it means having the added
power of Miami when looking for a

percent of Miami’s haul is better than
facing the prospect of leaving the Big East.

Let's face it, Big East basketball is about

mighty Hurricanes thrown in there, and
the Atlantic Coast Conference and the
Southwest Conference are both talking
about contracts, which mean money. And

It’s the best of both worlds: big-time
money from the Big East for basketball
and big-time money from a conference

The Hurricanes bring a proven football

Big East has exposure in six of the 16-

That not-so-small fact can help recruiting
tremendously. As Pitt and other northern
teams play Miami, Pitt will receive free
exposure to many athletes in many different
sports.

Florida has been a veritable gold mine
the last few years and could be a major
source of talent for Big East schools.

In addition, Miami has many other items

While you can think about the money
and the future possibilities of a Miami-Big

situation. Miami is famous nationally for

know the story of how it was going to be

provides the schools playing football on

This hope for future alliance, while it
may seem to favor the original members of

Even though football is not a current Big

Despite the seemingly endless
construction of new and
improved athletic facilities at Pitt,

pthe problem of providing
recreational athletic areas for
students and faculty remains a
aressing issue.

Over 8,000 students take part
in organized intramural sports,
and combined with the number
of students who simply want to
use the weight room orjust shoot

.&oops at any given time, it leaves
some individuals out in the cold.

The No. 1 complaint that
intramural—sports director Marilyn
Ross receives concerns the lack

of facilities.

“One of the most popular
activities here is just coming up
and shooting hoops,” Ross said.
Because Fitzgerald Field House
is too small to handle all of the
varsity teams, certain squads end
up taking over the gymnasiurns
in Trees Hall, and it’s the students
who wind up playing second
fiddle.

“During the fall, that’s OK, but
in the winter when everyone
wants to come up and shoot
hoops, there is no place to just go
and [do thatl,” she said.

Student swimming time in Trees
Pool is almost non—existent. With
the swim teams practicing until
about 6 p.m., there are only two

lanes open in the large pool for
students during most of the day.

The construction of the new
Cost Center, which has been
reserved mainly for the tennis
and football teams, has not helped
to solve the recreational-space
problem, according to Ross.

“As far as alleviating any of the
lack—of-gym—space problem,
none,” she said. “They didn’t want
us to put any other activity in
there, at least for the first year.”

When the Cost Center first
opened, Ross proposed opening
the complex for volleyball and
indoor soccer to allow more of
the gym time in Trees Hall for
recreational basketball. Thus far,
Pitt hasn’t granted Ross her

request.

She said she understands that
the football team puts Pitt's name
in the public eye, and that athletic-
department money built the Cost
Center, so it has the final word on
what the facilities are used for.

Ross has worked hard to get
some current changes at Trees
Hall. For two years she worked
with the Student Government
Board to get the weight room
expanded. Currently, the weight
room has a maximum capacity of
50 people. When construction is
completed in late January, the
maximum capacity will double.

“That will be a tremendous
help because there is not a whole
lot of anything for students to do

Intmmumls still /oaz/mg trouble ﬁnding ample space ,

once they come up here,” she
said.

Another proposal made by the
intramural office concerned the
building of a recreational facility
on the lower campus. The office
proposed building the new
parking garage underground
between Hillman Library and
Carnegie Library and building
something like the Cost Center
on top where people can go and
shoot hoops or play volleyball
instead of just tennis. But it didn’t
go through.

The intramural office is doing
all it can to alleviate the
overcrowding problem. "We
propose things all the time. "I just

to offer the Big East. A top-notch
academic institution with an
impressive 7 to 1 student—to—
faculty ratio, Miami fits in well
with the other conference schools.
Also, Miami’s mere presence

assures that Pitt, Syracuse and BC
will remain Big East schools for
quite some time. Previously, Pitt
had entertained an offer from the
Metro Conference, among others,
in an attempt to preserve football
security and jump on the con-

ference realignment bandwagon.

The ﬁnal benefit that this
agreement offers is: for the time
being, Miami, Pitt, Syracuse and
BC can continue to play
challenging schedules against
teams around the nation and

only have commitments to each
other until a conference affiliation
is completed. All in all, not a bad
deal. .
Just think of the money.

years. Miami is remaining
independent in baseball.
Would you give up a cool
couple of million for
yourself to be split among
your conference buddies,

whose combined talent
cou1dn’t defeat your team?
I think not. ,

So, where is the real
advantage to Miami joining
the Big East, a basketball
powerhouse? Miami’s
basketball team could best
be described as struggling.
Joining such powers as
Syracuse, Georgetown,
Villanova and Pittsburgh,
along with a usual “sleeper”
like Providence or Seton
Hall, can only be described
as a parasitic one.

The former revenue-
sharing plan split monies
earned in the NCAA
tournament and national
television appearances nine
ways. Now, they will be
split 10. This isn’t too bad
when you look at it this
way, but if you think back
to the NCAA tournaments
of the past couple of years,
the Big East had the most .
teams participating, five
teams in 1988 and six in
1989.

In ’88 Seton Hall made it
all the way to the final
round. Each team in the
Final Four earns over $2
million. Each team in the
tournament earns $60,000. ,
Assuming that Seton Hall
earned $2 million and the
rest got $60,000, that’s a
conference share of
$2,300,000, or $460,000 per
member. Considering St.
John’s won the National
Invitation Tournament the
same year, each Big East
school, whether they were
Georgetown or last-place
Boston College, got over
$500,000. Not a bad future
racket for Miami.

While Miami might bring
national prestige and the
possible effect of solidifying
the Big East for years to
come, its move was not
merely for humanitarian

baseball, you name it

OK, so the Athletics didn’t
dismantle the Reds. So my editor
put in “a little sports humor” at
the end of my last story, very
little, but that’s beside the point.
Is that supposed to stop me from

‘,running my rather large match?

Hey, I’m coming from a high
school paper in which one of the
otherwriters called Magicjohnson
and Isiah Thomas homosexuals
in one of his columns when they
kissed at mid court in the NBA
finals, so I’ll say just about
anything, no matter what a certain
editor with a “Rampa-ging” ego
might say. (Editor’s Note: Mr.

“Brady” Buncber has bad no
takers for a date yet.)

0 Speaking of large mouths and
rampaging egos, former Pitt
football player Burt Grossman,
who is now a defensive end for
the San Diego Chargers, was very
critical of Pitt in a story in Sports
Illustrated last week. I would say
he was a student athlete when he
was here, but that term just doesn’t
fit him. He spoke of rat problems
on campus, so is that why he
kept a boa constrictor for a pet
when he was here? If he hated
Pitt so much, why did he go to
school here?

He said the Steelers’ drafting a
guy from Liberty University
(rookie tight end Eric Green) was
like asking him to rip on them,
but didn’t the guy from Liberty
score two touchdowns against
his team, and hasn't his team
been on the losing side both
times they've played the Steelers
inhis career? If the Steelers are as
bad as he says, what does that
make him?

»3,. -Speaking of Steeler rookies,

was the play on a kickoff by

‘Thoughts on football,

Barry Foster against the 49ers the
all—time bonehead play or what?
How can you just forget that the
ball is live on that play?

Foster can take some solace in
this story. I remember a rookie
running back for the Steelers a
few years ago who had dumb

Ryan
Buncher

penalties called on him in
consecutive games, costing the
team big punt returns, including
a touchdown. His name was
Ferdinars “Scoop” Gillespie. He
was a terrible player and didn’t
make the team the next season.
Sorry Barry, wrong story. I just
like saying Ferdinars “Scoop”
Gillespie. I like the sound of it.

There is also the story of a
Steeler running back whose
mistakes caused punts to be
blocked. That was Merril Hoge.
That could be encouraging,
except Hoge is still with the team,
and Foster has just about no
chance of taking his starting spot
for a long time.

-The Steelers’ loss to the 49ers
hurt because San Francisco isn’t
as invulnerable as it was last year
(that’s like saying a multi-
millionaire isn’t as rich because
he lost five bucks), but a worse
loss may have gone unnoticed.
Defensive end Aaron Jones broke
his foot in the game. His disruptive
play up front has been a big part
of the team’s defensive
improvement this year.

One more thing on that game.
In the first half, when the Steeler

  

Golden Key

National Honor Society

passing game was going great,
they ran a draw play on third
down and ﬁve near midfield.
Why? A running play from the
Steelers is never a surprise.
They’ve been running draws on
third and long for years, and it
never works. They finally have a
good passing game, so use it
when it is needed.

-This is absolutely unrelated
to what I just said, but wasn’t it
great that George Steinbrenner
was on “Saturday Night Live”
while one of the managers he
fired, Lou Pinella, was busy
celebrating a World Series
championship with his Cincinnati
Reds? All is not well for Sweet
Lou. He had to kiss Reds’ owner
Marge Schott after the victory. It

-was either her or her dog

Schottzie; I have a .hard time
telling them apart. Either way it
must have been a terrible

experience.
0 Speaking of bad experiences,

the Pitt volleyball team has had
some bad experiences recently.

Whether it is a lack of fan support «

or the loss of Ann Marie Lucanie
to an ankle injury (it is probably
a combination of both), it doesn’t
seem like the same team that was
on such a roll a few weeks ago.
The attendance has improved
recently, though.

Things turned after the ﬁrst
game of the team’s big match
against Penn State. It ended on a
lift call against Pitt. Coach Sue
Woodstra said of the call, “You
just don’t make that call on game
point." -

This probably isn’t the cause of
Pitt’s problems since then, but it
is just another example of
incompetent officiating at the
volleyball games. The refs are
rarely on the same page —— and
where did they get this one guy,
who has done a lot of matches at
Fitzgerald Field House, who looks
like a retired Maytag repairman.

Crowd-

Continued from page 7

think that we get pushed

down on the priority list
[Pitt's] overall view and what
we feel are the overall needs
of the university are two
different things.”

The construction of the
new track in Pitt Stadium is
also causing problems for
Pitt’s intramural sports. Due
to the painting of the lane
lines on the track, many of
the intramural soccer teams
have not even played a
game yet.

“Teams would go down
to the field and find out that
they were cancelled and

. get angry,” said Ross. “So it

was really a terrible season. ”

Interest in intramural,
sports continues to rise, but
this in itself poses the same
old problem to Ross and
the intramural office —— lack
of facilities.
