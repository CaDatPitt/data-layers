Vol. 73, No. 94

Pitt News Staff Writer

1' ‘The state legislature remains

deadlocked over the general funds
portion of the Pennsylvania
budget, leaving the four state
related universities—Pitt, Lincoln,
Penn State and Temple—waiting
for appropriations.

The Senate voted June 5 not to
accept the House version of -Gov.
Richard Thornburgh’s 1979-80
budget. The main point of
contention between the Repub-
lican-dominated House and the
Democratic-contolled Senate is the
question of funding certain por-

7 tions of the state appropriations

bill.
Before the Senate passes the bill,
the House must develop a way to

raise revenue to cover budget
obligations, according to Thomas
Lamb, assistant vice chancellor,
governmental relations.

The revenue issue revolves
around the personal and net
corporate income tax levels. The
House and Thornburgh favor
retaining the current levels of 2.2
and 10.5 percent, respectively.
Most Democrats and some Repub-
licans want the personal income tax
to revert back to the 1977 level of
9.5 percent.

‘‘If the current tax levels expire,
there will be no funds (to back a
recently approved 7 percent
increase in appropriations for
Pitt),” Lamb said.

If the House fails to act on the tax

question, revenue projections will
automatically be based on the 1977
levels, effective December 30,
unless legislatively blocked,
according to Lamb.

In the meantime, the Board of
Trustees raised tuition for the fall
term based on two separate plans
for funding Pitt"by the state.

One plan, proposed by Thom-
burgh, grants Pitt a 4.5 percent
appropriation’s increase and the
second, sponsored by the House,
recommends a 7 percent increase.

Accordingly, tuition for a student
enrolled in the College of Arts and
Sciences will pay $65 more per
term with the House plan, and $85
more per term if the Thornburgh
plan is accepted. Either way, Pitt
students face a deﬁnite tuition

increase for the fall term, the ﬁfth
increase since 1976.

The Student Government Board
responded to the decision by
passing a resolution calling for the
Trustees to hold an advertised
public meeting “open to all Pitt
students” to discuss the need and
implications of the pending tuition
increase. 5

Copies of the resolution have
been delivered to Chancellor
Posvar and his six vice chancellors.
Thus far, the university has not
responded publicly to the reso-
lution.

It is now up to the Republican
leadership to convince Senate
Democrats to go along with the
House budget, leaving the current

personal income tax intact, accord-
ing to Lamb.

Lamb said in an interview earlier
this month, that he could not
speculate whether the possibility of
a delay of the budget proposal-
like the agonizing ﬁve month delay
of two years ago-——would exist
during current budget voting.

“There is always a chance of
that,” he said. “At this particular

point, I don't want to predict. ~

There is lots of time to resolve this
issue.”

Lamb said the House is currently
meeting to try and solve the
revenue question.

One Harrisburg observer told the
Pitt News, “Pitt should sweat if
they (the legislature) don't con-
tinue those taxes.”

Pitt School Year in Review: Tragedy and Controversy

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staffwriter

The year 1979 began on a note of
tragedy for Pitt students with
murder of freshman Monica Renee
Jones.

Jones, 18, of Philadelphia, was
discovered by a janitor and campus
policeman, raped and strangled in
a Tower A basement trash room in
the early hours of January 3.

Six months later, City and
campus police have failed to
apprehend a suspect in the murder
that jarred students, faculty and
staff to instant security conscious-
ness.

The rash of heightened interest
in campus security began with an
order from campus police Chief
“Curt” Graham to in-
crease police manpower in the
residence hall area.

Some students attempted to take
campus security into their own
hands. ,

Black Greeks moved forth 

plans for a campus escort system
that assured no female students
would ever be forced travel alone
on campus at night.

Members of the Resident Stu-
dent Association issued demands
to housing oﬁcials for increased
internal security in the residence
halls. Resident students also urged
officials to limit the “relative ease”
with which the non-student public
could gain access to the Litchﬁeld
Tower complex, home of more than
3,000 students.

The students’ demands were met
by the administration with a special
summer construction program in
the Towers. The project entailed
rerouting trafﬁc in and out of the
Litchﬁeld Towers, the hub of both
resident and campus traffic.

Pitt students have faced “bud-
getary uncertainty” and the
accompanying tuition increases
ﬁve times since 1976; this year is
no different.

Undergraduates may be forced

to withstand a tuition hike of up to
$170 next year, as passed by the
board of trustees earlier this
month. The amount of the hike
hinges on whether Pennsylvania
lawmakers grant Pitt and three
other state-related universities
(Penn State, Lincoln and Temple) a
5 or 7 percent increase in
appropriations.

Long before thoughts of campus
security and budge crises ap-
peared, Pitt students were stand-
ing up to voice their opinions in
other matters.

In late October, the Black Action

‘Society, led by Chairman Mark

Holloway, clashed with members of
the newly ’ formed Pitt Union
Program Council.

The council was developed last
summer to act as a centralized
source of lecture, concert, and
other programming on campus.

BAS initially charged the council
with failing to utilize a sufﬁcient
part of its $110,000 student

activities fee allocation to program
events geared to black students.

In the weeks following these
charges by BAS, the program
council and its chairperson Tammy
Haddad once again became the
target of controversy. Haddad,
music committe chairperson Steve
Vance, council advisor Jack Brown,
and Director of Student Activities
Willard “Bud” Heaps proved to be
the center of this controversy.

According to the contract bet-
ween the office of Student
Activities and student government,
and the program council, students
were not permitted to produce
major concerts. The contract
stated all such programs must be
implemented by outside profes-
sional promoters.

Haddad revealed to The Pitt
News that the contract had been
violated when the program council
produced the Homecoming Week
Chuck Mangione concert.

Weeks of discussion over who
was at fault for the contract
breakage followed.

Soon after Heaps resigned his
position to “pursue other career
opportunities.” At the present
time, a special search committe is
completing its work in ﬁnding
Heaps’ successor.

A special university search
committee completed the task of
ﬁlling the post of vice chancellor of
student affairs, left vacant last year
when Alfred Moye resigned to
accept a position with the U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare. While most students
were home on Christmas break, the
university announced the appoint-
ment of Conney M. Kimbo as
Moye’s successor. Kimbo, a native
of the Pittsburgh area, came to Pitt
after serving in a similar position at
the University of Missouri at St.
Louis.

Student Government: Svi

JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Unlike the student council of a
typical high school, a major
university’s student government
has real legislative and ﬁscal
responsibilities, and Pitt's is no
exeption.

Pitt’s student government con-
sists of seven elected under-
graduates who compose the Stu-
dent Government Board and a
group of nine standing committees
who report directly to that
executive body.

Complicating the SGB’s job is its
responsibility to allocate over
$270,000 to some 115 student
organizations, a process which is
tedious and at times, frustrating.
These funds originate from the
student activities fee, a $12 per
term stipend collected from Pitt
students earmarked for student

g organizations.

Not only must the board assure
responsible allocation of the fee, it
also manages student govern-
ment’s internal budget, totaling
about $85,000.

The board’s legislative, repre-
sentative, and fiscal functions, in

addition to some of the same ~

political manuevering and bureau-
cratic decision-making of civic
governments, provides students a
practical learning experience and a
chance to determine how the
university operates.

“It is serious business and the
magnitude of the board’s actions is
serious,” Stan Galanski, SGB
president, told The Pitt News.

The Board’s most important
role is to act as a student advocate
presenting student causes, campus
wide problems and even individual
students’ problems to the univer-
sity administration.

“University administrators know
who board members are (as

-v ;

opposed to most undergraduates),
which helps when we are trying to
solve problems,” said Galanski.

Galanski, a second term SGB
member, is joined on the board by
Rita Cordisco, Cindy DeMatteo
(president pro tempore), Helen
Gianella, Tom Kunkel, Todd Park,
and Kim Watterson, all serving
their first term.

The board members, having
been in office only four months, are
beginning to feel more comfortable
in their roles as student advocates,
according to Galanski. Past
experience shows once the board

reaches that stage, positive pro-

grams and creative ideas result.

“A lot of energy is now being
expended in a very creative sense
by the people comprising the
board,” said Galanski. “The board
is coming together philosophically
and in terms of goals.

“I think we will see a

tremendous output during the
remainder of our terms,” he
added.

One of the board’s initial

accomplishments was surviving the
annual allocations process. Pro-
cedural changes moved allocations
from late spring/early summer to
the winter term. , This caused
problems for the newly-elected
SGB as most organizations’ bud-
gets had already been submitted
during their predecessors’ terms in
ofﬁce.

Being the only incumbent on the
new board, and thus, the only
person on the board experienced in
formulation a budget request for
that organization, Galanski had to
prepare the new SGB budget plus
help to prepare the standing
committees’ before he was pres-
ident.

The new Board members, 'in
other words, had to deal with a
process about which they knew

little or nothing.

A new Student Government
Constitution will change next
year’s SGB inauguration date from
March 1 to Jan. 1, plenty of time for
the new board to become accus-
tomed to the allocations process.

Among the goals of this year’s
SGB is to set up student
government complaint centers, a
project begun by the last board,
according to Galanski.

Students with complaints about
any part of the university will be
able to pick up post cards at over
100 campus locations and send
their complaints to the SGB ofﬁce
via campus mail.

The new program will be
instituted during the Fall term,
according to Galanski. He hopes

Black Action Society meets  
The Black Student’sNeeds

The Black Action Society serves

I as an outlet for concerns of black

students on campus and provides
referrals for specific problems.

President Mona Driscoe describes
as “the university’s insensitivity
and lack of understanding to

“discriminatory policies” of many
advisers. -

BAS is concerned with the black
community as well, in promoting
“equality and justice in the
system,” says Driscoe, and is
asked to speak at community
functions, workshops, dinners, etc.

But the organization’s main
target is the campus community.

BAS has over 120 active
members,_ publishes a monthly
newspaper;the BAS Forum, and
publishes a bi-monthly newsletter.

The organization has seven
standing committees: Program-
ming; Public Relations; Zodakas
(Black Greek Council); the Forum

 

newspaper; Cultural Arts; Political
Action; and BASICS-Black Active
Students in Intercollegiate Strug-
gle, a network committee.

In addition, ther. are three
sub-committees: Community
Affairs; Newsletter; and Service
Dinner.

The organization is run through
four elective offices: Chairperson,
Deputy Chairperson, Executive
Secretary and Financial Secretary.

BAS will host orientation
meetings and presentations on
Sunday and Monday nights, June
24 and 25 on the main floor of the
Student Union building.

students will use the complaint
center for both large and small
problems.

“In terms of measuring how a
student government performs, you
can’t just look at the big things
accomplished,” he said. It’s the
small things, the day-to-day things
that are the most important.”

The key to successful involve-
ment in student government is to
“work your way up’ ’ through active
membership on one of the nine
standing committees.

Galanski, Park, 5 and Gianella
began their student government
careers by following the committee
route.

“Experience is needed to learn,

the ropes,” Galanski said. “You
remember things from working on
the committees and get to meet
people on the way up.

“If there is one thing to be
gained by involvement in student
government, it is the many
friendships that result,” he added.

WPGH: Pitts Sation Offerslnteresting

By  WARREN

' Many avid Pittsburgh radio
listeners have been disappointed
lately by what some call Top 40 or
teenybopper musical program-
ming.

What most listeners do not know
is that progressive radio, a format
with few commercials and lots of
rock and roll, is still alive in the
form of WPGH Radio, Pitt’s
student-operated radio station.

“We like to think we provide
listeners with the opportunity to
hear new music first,” said Dan

‘Shalenko, WPGH general man-

ager.

Aside from having'a rare, yet
enjoyable musically oriented for-
mat, WPGH is unique in its mode
of broadcast. While most radio
stations broadcast through an FM
or AM transmission signal, Shal-

enko’s station broadcasts via a
carrier current system.

A carrier current is a closed
circuit system consisting of tele-
phone lines attached to small,
20-watt transmitters, providing
radio reception to a limited
audience. WPGH broadcasts to
most of Pitt’s residence halls and
can be received by students at 640
AM.

Although carrier current broad-
casting has its advantages (like the
freedom from regulation by the
Federal Communications Commis-
sion), Shalenko wants to build an
FM station to broadcast “open
air.” An open air license would
expand the WPGH listening
audience to all of Allegheny
County.

“This is important because most
of Pitt’s students live off campus
and we would like to be a service to

the entire Pitt community,” Shal-
enko said.
The application process for an

FCC construction permit must be’

‘submitted by the Board of
Trustees. If a construction permit
is granted, WPGH will have one

year to purchase and install the‘

necessary equipment for an FM
station. If the FCC ﬁnds the
station’s broadcast equipment
acceptable, WPGH will have its
open-air license.

The station’s programming is not
exclusively music; special shows
about sports, academics, and other
activities will hopefully help
WPGH become an information
center for Pitt students.

The organizational structure of
WPGH is much like that of any
professional station, with numer-
ous departments invnlxed in
programming, news, sports, public

relations, advertising and busi-
ness, engineering, public affairs,
traffic and announcing.

Shalenko said the best way to

become involved at the station is to
“show an interest early, particu-
larly during the first two weeks of

the fall term when the majority of

The station begins its annual

ORL, Housing Office Aid Residence Hall Students’ Lives

FRED FONSECA

By JEFF COUCH

Pitt News Staff Writer
An estimated 60 to 70 percent of

.Pitt’s incoming freshmeniclass will

live in campus residence halls
administered by the Office of
Residence Life and the Housing‘
Ofﬁce. '
Both offices are designed to
provide quality services specifically
aimed at dormitory residents.
Because of the unique atmo-
sphere, dormitory residents need a
“guiding light” to make life easier
and perhaps, simpler. Both ORL
and Housing are desigend to
provide quality services specifically
geared to these students. V
‘Each office share the respon-
sibility of assigning room accom-
odations to Pitt students, but at the
same time, each office maintains
separate responsibilities in other
areas.’

The Housing Office, under the
direction of Donovan Hughes,
provides services which continue
year round, like housekeeping,
maintenance, parking assignments
and desk staffing.

ORL, directed by Fred Fonseca,
deals with specific programs like
leadership development, alterna-
tive lifestyle and staffing the
residence halls with Resident
Assistants.

“Our underlying philosophy is to
maximize the educational and
social interaction in our residence
hall environments to enhance a
student’s growth as an individual,”
Fonseca said.

“A lot of learning takes place
outside the classroom,” he added.

New students entering the
residence halls this fall will not
notice the extensive security
changes that have been made,

since most residents left for the
summer. '
The changes in security were

made to illustrate the need for

security consciousness by resi-
dents, according to one ORL
administrator.

Major security changes include

‘A the construction of a new common

laundry facility for the Litchfield
Towers. A, Pitt coed was found
strangled and raped in the old
facility, formerly located in the
basement of Tower A.

A 24-hour security system will be
implemented in the Towers, where
students must show I.D.’s to enter
their residence hall.

In the past, the Towers lobby
was served as a through way for
students going to the cafeteria or
the Office of Resident Life, creating
security problems.

Another possible change for next’

year is combining meal tickets and
university identification cards,
according to Hughes.

“We would hope to sophisticate
that (the I.D. card system) so much

that it cuts down on illegal room .

changes, and illegal entrances (into
the residence halls),” Hughes said.
“It is a.positive step in terms of
the residents,’.’ he added.
The ORL will institute a new
program this fall called “Take
Pitt,” involving the education of

resident students about university '

resources .

“We feel we have a responsibili--

ty to work with new students to
encourage more people to use the
many university resources,” said
Tim Snyder.

One of the most important goals
of the ORL offie, according to

community among the residents.

Who's Who at Pitt

at Pitt.

By JEFF DUROSKOV

For many students, the freshman year is a blur of people, places, and
.Not only does the rookie have to deal with the trauma of living with someone who doesn ’t even
believe in the words clean and considerate, and the even bigger crisis of having to choose a
major, but he must learn who and what purpose is served by a seemingly endless list of persons

For those incoming freshmen, the following list of Who ’s Who at Pitt is dedicated.

long lines.

Wesley Posvar

Wesley Posvar is the university's
Chancellor, the head guy. Posvar is
the guy who everyone gets down on
whenever they are dissatisﬁed with
Pitt.

Don’t do that. Posvar is a truly
nice guy who really does care about
the students, and besides, he has a
Board of Trustees to answer to.
Every boss has a boss.

Posvar is a West Point graduate,
and can_ been seen at the
homecoming football game and
bonfire. He also makes appear-
ances at several other university
activities.

You’ll meet him live and in
person, in September during the'
first week of Fall term at the
Chancellor's reception. Give him a
handshake and a kind word or two.

Cas Myslinski

Cas Myslinski, the Pitt athletic
director is an old West Point buddy
of Chancellor Wesley Posvar. He
has been at it a long time, and
apparently knows his stuff.

Under his direction, Pitt athletics
have come into their own, doing a
lot of winning, all-around. Besides
the 1976 national football cham-
pions, Pitt has had some top
ﬁnishers in other sports; including
water polo, swimming and
women's gymnastics.

group of students at Pitt; those‘
pursuing undergraduate degrees in
CA5 departments.

Schulman is the guy who must
sign your add/ drop form when you
just have to get out of that upper
level Chemistry course—but you
just didn’t get around to it until
after the deadline date.

His office is located on the ninth
floor of the Cathedral.

Jackie Sherrill

If you haven't heard this name
yet, kid, you're either not a football
fan...or you're in big trouble
already. Jackie Sherrill, of course,
is the head football coach at Pitt. in
charge of making you, the student,
happy and also showing you a good
time on Saturday afternoons.
Hopefully, for his and his job's
sake, he is doing the same for the

alumni.

 

GHI.|CK_ KATZ V

Sherrill is in his third year at Pitt,
after a short stint at Washington
State University. He replaced
Johnny Majors after Majors was
called home to Tennessee to
immediately begin a new tradition
of winning there.

Stan Galanski

Stan Galanski is the president of
Pitt's Student Government

‘ Board—a seven member organiza-

tion elected by undergraduates
each Winter term.

Among Galanski’s concerns are
the Pitt Union Program Council
tPUPC), WPGH, Pitt's campus

radio station and Student Union

renovations.

He would like to see WPGH
become an open air FM radio
station because “students need a
place to tune to as the voice of Pitt
even if they live off-campus."
WPGH today, can only be heard in
campus buildings.

Galanski said he is in favor of the
student union being totally ren-
ovated, and added that students
will pay for the renovations.
However, he is not in favor of
students paying for the renovation
of non-student facilities.

Galanski and SGB won't change
the world, or even bring about “any
tuition cuts, but they do have the
students’ best interests in mind.

Conney Kimbo

Conney Kimbo, almost as new to
Pitt as yourself, is Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs. Kimbo was
hired last winter to replace Alfred
Moye.

Responsible for most day-to-day
decisions ‘that affect students’
nonacademic life. Kimbo also is the
Chancellor's chief counselor in
student activities. His other
concerns include the Student Union
renovations, campus living condi-
tions, student health and the
counseling and placement centers.

Kimbo is easily recognized as the
guy who is doing his laundry right
along side you in Bruce Hall, as

that is where he takes up
residence.
Curt Graham

Charles “Curt" Graham is the
chief of Pitt's campus police
department, a squad probably
larger than your hometown police
force.

The campus police have had
their work cut out for them lately,
with the continuing worries con-

~ JULIUS RAY

cerning security. But, most of the
squad’s actions involve service
functions-—opening locked build-
ings and reassuring members of
the Pitt community. They will help
if they can, but keep in mind they
are a police force, like any other
and can do anything any officer can
do—even arrest you. ‘

Terry Milani

Terry Milani replaced Willard
“Bud" Heaps as director of
student activities last year. His job
is to occupy students in their spare
time rather than let them read
“Penthouse” and make up obscene
jokes about Penn State.

Milani does this (create act-
ivities. not read “Penthouse") by
overseeing student organizations
and programs. By the way, if
you're at all confused about the
difference between Milani’s office
and Conney Kimbo's, don't worry,
you’ll catch on soon.

  Chuck Katz

Chuck Katz is the Student Union
building's night manager. After 4
p.m., he’s the man who can
produce keys, give permission for
myriad actions and manufacture
what seems to be minor miracles.

Even if you don't know Katz, but
are working in the Student Union
while he is on duty, expect to strike
up a conversation with him,
because he expects it.

Tim Grgurich

It is popular at Pitt to get down
on Tim Grgurich, Panther basket-
ball coach for what many call
“young coach mistakes.” But,
after ﬁnishing second in the
Eastern Eight last year, with a
bright future ahead, his critics may
silence themselves, for a little
while at least.

Grgurich still doesn't let the
criticism get him down or dampen
his enthusiasm. An eternal
optimist, he is always looking to
better days ahead.

Soon we'll see how Grgurich will
cope with new critics (possibly
yourself included)’ but then again,
maybe he won't have any critics to
cope with. Now, that's optimism!

Sam Clancy

Sam Clancy is a Panther
basketball player. But not just any
basketball player. Clancy is
nicknamed “Sam Bam” and “Slam
Bam Sam" and “Slammin’ Sam"

by his fans and peers alike, for his
amazingly tough play and exciting
slam dunk shots.

Clancy was selected to try out_ for
the Pan American games and IS 3
1980 Olympic hopeful.

If you see Sam on campus. you’ll
know it. Also, be nice to Sam.
I don't know too many people who
would cross him.

Fred Fonseca
Director of the Office of

Fonseca is, among other things,
your RA’s boss. (More about your
RA later.) He can help you if you
would like a new room, a new paint
job in your room or a new person
occupying your room with you.

If you would like to move into one
of the special units in the
dormitories, Fonseca will gladly
explain the wonders of quiet living,
co-ed living and limited visitation
living. ‘

Don Hughes

Donovan Hughes is the housing
director andihis office is located
behind the Towers’ main desk.
He is the man who is in charge of
getting as many people as he can
into university housing.

Hughes is also concerned with
security and he is partially
responsible for the renovations
done to the Towers lobby to
maintain 24-hour security.

Broken elevators is one ‘of
Hughes’ other areas of concern,
and he can cite by memory several
dollar amounts which the univer-
sity must shell out when a
Westinghouse man is summoned at
4 a.m. on a Sunday. So, please, be
nice to his elevators, or you may

Remember thispman. On that
cold, icy day when you just don't
feel like trudging up to Trees Hall
for your swimming class, look for
Jud Hillard. He is the campus bus
driver who will take you there, free
of charge.

Hillard is the man who can take
you from Trees Hall to frat row to
the Student Union. He normally
makes pick-ups at each stop every
15 minutes. But, because of
Oakland traffic (you’ll learn about
that soon enough) you may have to
be patient. Stand at a place along
his route for half an hour and
chances are that he'll come by.

Julius Ray

Julius Ray is the university's
ombudsman, and as such holds an
interesting and, if you should ever
need him, important job.

Ray is the man to see if you find
yourself with an incorrect invoice or
any other problem rooted in Pitt
bureaucracy.’ He has full access to
university records and defends
students with moral and practical
arguments.

Be cautioned however-—he holds '

no real power, and any administra-
tor can, technically, tell him to go
back and play with his students.

Charlene Hunter

Charlene Hunter is the coordina-
tor of the campus judicial system,
the medium through which alleged-
ly naughty students are tried by
other students.

There is a lengthy student code
of conduct, and violators often wind

the offense is punishable in city
court. Whether you've maimed a
university pinball machine or your
roommate, you'll probably end up
‘meeting Hunter.

Greeks—opinions run the ex-
tremes of the gamut on the topic.
Those who haven’t gone Greek, or
at least checked out the system
might fantasize about “Animal
House,” or cite the seriousness of
the current controversy over
fraternities at Dartmouth, but
emotions run high in any case, and
the best way to ﬁnd out what Greek

' . life is really like is to check it out.

As universities go, Pitt has a
Greek community of 22
fraternities and 15 sororities.
Greeks account for less than 15
percent of the undergraduate
population here, compared to 30-50

percent at other large schools,

The fraternities are spread across
Belleﬁeld, Dithridge and Bayard
Streets; sororities are primarily
housed in suites at Amos Hall, a
dormitory in the quadrangle, and

while no one denies that Greeks are .
mainly a social function at Pitt, *

there’s a serious" side, too.

“.1 think the system teaches
community involvement, though

this might not show until the

student has graduated and is out in

assistant director of student act-A

ivities and Pitt’s Greek advisor.
During the past year, the Greeks

Fraternities have a long history
at Pitt; the ﬁrst, Phi Gamma Delta,
wasestablished in 1863. Trad-
itionally, there have been less
sororities than fraternities. The
first sorority at Pitt was Kappa
Alpha Tau in 1916, but, ﬁttingly
enough, the latest Greek organiza-
tion to join the university is Kappa
Delta in 1979. __

The biggest asset the Greek way
of life provides, McLinden
believes, is the personal contact.

“There was a need that I had in
school and the system met them,”
McLinden said. “When these

Codeof Conduct Provides Rules For Pitt Students  

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer ,
Pitt students are not only
required to follow the same federal,
state and local laws as all United
States citizens, they must also
adhere to rules and regulations

approved by the Board of Trustees.

These laws, as stated in the
Student Code of Conduct, cover
non-academic standards of
“conduct appropriate to the
University in consonance with the
educational goals of the
University,” according to the

University of Pittsburgh Student’
of conduct and Judicial

Code
Procedures Handbook.

The Code covers five major
categories of offenses: related to
person(s), property, the operation
of the university, welfare, health
or safety, and these related to the
university student jucicial system.

All ﬁve categories cover offenses
ranging from physical abuse to
stealing personal and university
property to alcohol violations.

Most students never familiarize

themselves with the Code and
some suffer because of it.
Knowledge of the university
judicial system is just as important
as knowledge of the Code,
particularly for students living in
Pitt’s residence halls. ‘
Violations of the Code during the
winter term resulted in the
prosecution last week of about 30
Pitt students. They were charged
with one or more of the following
"offenses; “knowingly and without
(consent of authorization has in his
or her posession property of

another person of the University,
removing or using in his room
University property which hasbeen
placed in lounges or. other public
areas of the residence halls, and/ or

abusing, misusing, removing or

damaging or
equipment. ’ ’
The hearing panel was appointed .

by Chancellor Wesley Posvar and

fire safety

' consisted of three administrators.

A majority vote, when at least
two of the administrators agree on
a decision, was required to convict
or acquit a student.

Search for Activities Director Near Completion

By JBFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer .

- Interviews with the eight semi-
finalists for the Directorship of
Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Student Activities
were completed this week by the
Search Committee and if all goes as
planned, a new director will be
named on or near July 1.

The position has been vacant
since the sudden resignation of
Willard “Bud” Heaps last
November.

Terri Milani, assiciate Director of
Student Activities, has been
performing the duties of director

since Heap’s resignation.

The Search Committee, chaired
by Robert Gallagher, must choose
three to ﬁve finalists to recommend
to Vice-chancellor of Student
Affairs Conney Kimbo. It is Kimbo
who will make the ﬁnal decision.

Gallagher said the Search
Committee should have the ﬁnal
recommendations to Kimbo some-
time next week.

A group of student leaders posed
additional questions to the semi-'
ﬁnalists, outside of those asked by
the Search Committee. The
committee was composed of nine

students and administrators who’
have reviewed applications,
conducted reference checks, and
questioned candidates for the
position.

The committee rated each of the
original applicants according to a
three-point scale. ‘

Rating “one” means the
applicant “looks good and deserves
further- investigation;”‘ rating
“two” means the applicant “is a.
possibility, but do not investigate
the applicant further at this time
and rating “three means the
applicant “is not qualiﬁed for this

position and will not be given
further consideration,” according‘
to Gallagher.

, Each candidate with a “one
rating was thoroughly reviewed,
and their references were inter-
viewed via phone.

“With a telephone reference
check,” Gallagher said last month,
“we are more likely to get a better
feel for the person.”

According to the timetable
established by Kimbo, a new
director of Student — Activities
should be named by July and
assume responsibilities August 1.

In last week’s proceedings,
Charlene Hunter,‘ coordinator of
the university student‘ judicial
system received special permission

through a petition to a Chancellor 1

to use ‘administrators rather than
students to try the cases. This is a
right granted to the coordinator
through the approved rules
governing the judicial system.

Normally,- the campus Judicial
board, “has jurisdiction over
graduate, professional and under-
graduate students for matters
arising from the Student Code of
Conduct”, according to the hand-
book. The Board is a body "of 14
members, all students, appointed
for staggered two year terms.

Hearings by ‘the Board follow
strict detailed operating proce-
dures, as outlined by the
handbook.

If a defendant is found guilty or
he/ she signs an admission of guilt,
the Board must recommend disci-
plinary and restitutionary san-
tions, based on the gravity of the
offense. Sanctions range from a
disciplinary warning to disciplinary

dismissal or a substituted sanction, I

voluntarily undertaken by a student
which. can be stubstituted for a
regular sanction upon A approval
from the Board hearing ofﬁcer.

The job market. These will
become three important words in
the post-college job
Although it seems premature, now
is the time to prepare for successful
job hunting.

Experience is the key to ﬁnding
employment. Students can gain
experience through internships,
practicumsi, and volunteer work. In
studies on Pitt students who have
completed practical experiences,
the majority of them have said it
has been their best college
experience, ‘ according ‘to Daniel
Nagy, Director of the University
Placement Center.

Do internships improve chances
of ﬁnding good jobs?

“There is enough evidenceto
say yes,” says Nagy. People in the
placement ﬁeld acknowledge that
“there is no question that
employers look at experience.”

Summer experience is also
valuable, but most students can’t

get summer work in their major,

ﬁelds.

That is why the internship office
is so valuable,” explaines Nagy,
“it cuts through the roadblacks.”

As the debate of whether the
most valuable education is a liberal
arts or a more structured one
continues, recent Pitt graduates

search.

- arts,

surveyed replied that they both
wanted and expected a liberal arts
education and career preparation.
Nagy suggests that it is possible for
students to have their cake and eat
it too. Those in the pure academic
ﬁelds should combine it with a
second major or a minor in a more
practical ﬁeld.

Job placement is an area of
results. Students in the ﬁelds of
engineering, computer science,
and the health professions will
have no difﬁculty in obtaining
employment. Ninety-nine percent
of Pitt engineers are successfully
placed. Computer science is,
according to Nagy, “one of the
hottest things going.” And, there
will always be a need for health
professionals.

Results could be more difﬁcult
for some others. The least
sought-after grads are those in the
humanities, and social
sciences. There are some
math, economics, and business
majors. However, a grim
employment future does not await
the students in the least-sought
areas. With practical experience
and communication skills, employ-
ment can be found.

Nagy stresses the importance of
communication skills. “No matter
what your major,” he advises,”

LOOK INTO  
_ LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES

TRAVEL TO LATIN AMERICA

pick up a course in public speaking
and a course in composition.”

As jobs become more technical,
all areas of employment require
people who can speak and write
effectively, even in _ the most
technical ﬁelds.

The key to success in a job
interview is the ability to verbalize
what you want, or a job oppurtunity
may be lost. Communication skills
are more important in getting a job
than are grades. According to
Nagy, in one study, grades ranked
fifth among criteria used in
selecting college grads.

The job market will be produc-

tive for the college grad who begins .

preparation early in his or her
college career.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt is in the process of
formulating final plans for a $6.5
million renovation of the Student
Union (Schenley Hall), which could
change the internal layout and
appearance of the former hotel.

The present phase of planning
began about two years ago, with
discussions among student leaders
and university administrators
intensifying during the past year.

Former Student Government
Board president Josh Balyson, a
major student supporter of the
project, urged administrators to
move ahead on the project, toward
the end of his term of ofﬁce.

Baylson, chairing a Student
Affairs Advisory Committee in
Februrary, held a meeting in the
Student Union recreation room to
stress the urgency of improving the

conditions he termed a a

This is the only room, as far as I
on this campus where
students and faculty can sit down
with a cup of coffee and talk. It’s a
noisy place, not conducive to a
social atmosphere. This is a
community lounge, and I think ,it’s
disgraceful,” he said. 8

Associate Director of Student
Activities Terry Milani, responsible
for planning the renovation project,
outlined the future changes in the
facility earlier this week.

Milani said recreational facilities
will be improved, and will include
billiard tables, table games, an
archade, a snack bar and vending
area, and a brown bag lunch area.
Lounge space will also be enlarged,
with an additional television lounge
in the planning.

three verses of the “Alma Mater.”
What seems like an unnecessary
and sentimental task is actually a
practical one. The verses tell the
story of the university.
“Alma Mater,” in latin means
“foster mother” or “cherishing

mother.” Having an alma mater

means’that the school feels
responsible for the intellectual,
emotional, and social well-being of
the students.

The first verse, with ‘its “God
preserve Thee evermore,” is a
prayer. It gives a feeling about the

media area. The Pitt News and The

university as a place of light and
truth, and of learning. The line
“Thou shalt conquer as of yore”
could easily refer to any of the Pitt
athletic teams.

It is in the second verse that the
history of Pitt is outlined. Pitt is
the first college founded west of the
Allegheny Mountains. It was
founded as Pittsburgh Academy by
“prophet father” Hugh Henry
Brackenridge. (Yes, like Bracken-
ridge Hall. It was in the area -which
is now downtown Pittsburgh,
“where twin rivers” meet. This
was in 1787, “in the dawning of the
nation,” before ratiﬁcation of the
U.S. Constitution.

The school changed its name to
the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania. It was not until 1895 that
women were admitted. The first
two female graduates tied for the
first honors in the class of 1898.

It was also in 1898 that the
college became the University of
Pittsburgh, and moved to Oakland.
, The ﬁnal verse deals with Pitt’s
present state as a large, cosmopol-
itan university. All are gathered
here; of all “Castes and classes,
creeds and races.” The ﬁnal line
points to the future, which is

certainly the goal of every college‘

student.

To be able to say one’s ‘Alma
Mater’ does something to build a

sense of belonging,” say Dean‘

Rush, “it gives you a warm
feeling.” It also gives you a sense
of the history and meaning of the
university. V /

Associate Provost Resigns,
‘Takes New Post in Virginia

By GLENN FREUND
Pitt News Staff Writer

It looks like a perfect match-—Dr.
David R. Powers, Pitt's vice
provost, and George Mason
University—much to the dis-
pleasure of many at Pitt.

Powers, who has served in six
administrative capacities in 13
years of service at the university,
will become the vice president for
student affairs at GMU at the end
of the summer.

GMU, located in Fairfax, Vir'-
ginia, is described as one of the
fastest growing institutions of
higher learning in the country. It
has anenrollment of almost 11,000
students; half of them are the

_ children of government employees.

“Pitt is a mature, full—blown
university in a steady state. It
sounded more challenging and
interesting to be involved with a
university developing new prog-
rams and helping that university
develop and expand,” Powers
explained. “It sounded like a great
deal of fun.”

Powers said he learned of the
position at GMU through Provost
Rhoten Smith. “I was not job
hunting,” he emphasized, then
amended, “It was inevitable that I

0 would be leaving.”

Powers, who graduated from Pitt
in 1965 with an MA in political
science and received his Ph.D. in
1971, was appointed vice provost
last year when the position was

created in a redistribution of duties
in the provost’s offices. Powers,
who was formerly associate provost
since 1976, was handed the
responsibilities of academic prog-
ram planning, program develop-
ment and evaluation and research
development.

Smith said Power’s office will
remain vacant “at least tempor-
arily” and primarily for ﬁnancial
reasons.”

“He was an energetic and highly
productive administrator,” said
Smith. “He helped tremendously
in moving forward the plans and
affairs of the university.”

“He was the academic cons-
cience of those éfﬁces,” said Dr.

WHY CM-BBT?‘

“What I do about contraception is my business. After all, it's my life.
CM-BBT keeps me in control without fooling my body.

CM-BBT stands for Cervical Mucus and Basal Body Temperature-
two biological cycles which allow me to effect contraception. I found
out about CM-BBT at my Family Planning Center. The experts
there were just the kind of people I wanted to see. Professional.
Knowledgeable. Straightforward. Honest.

Family Planning Centers offer many contraceptive options, but
considering my lifestyle and outlook, I decided on CM-BBT.
This method has been thoroughly researched, investigated and
tested by scientists and doctors. It is a procedure which I under-
stand and feel comfortable with, and it does not interfere with
my body intany way. There's no medical risk involved—and
no crossed fingers. 0

Don't use CM-BBT without professional guidance. With the
-help of my Family Planning Counselor, I learned how to
detect; monitor and analyze “my body cycles. Recognizing
these physical changes tells me whether I am fertile or not.

The CM-BBT method has been tested at 90-95 percent effec-
tiveness. It is safe, effective and proven. If you're looking
for another choice in contraception, consider’ CM-BBT.
lt’s worth looking into. You can get more information

Powers Performance Excellent, Administrators Say

(Continued from page 8)
Herschel Grifﬁn, dean of the
Graduate School of Public Health.
“He had a positive role as a person
who always carried with him
integrity at all levels.”

Powers began his career as
administrator at Pitt in 1966
when, at age 27, he became the
director of the College of Arts and
Sciences advising center. He later
became assistant dean of Faculty
of Arts and Sciences, and served as
assistant’ to the chancellor for
academic affairs from 1970-1976,
during which time he was the
principal author of the university’s
“Affirmative Action and Equal
Opportunity Report,” in line with
the “Fairness doctrine,” submit-

ted to the Federal government in
1971 (for which he remarked he had
signiﬁcant help from his wife).

In 1974, Powers developed
“Guidelines on Academic Integ-
rity” and “The Statement on
Faculty Responsibility. ’ ’

Smith cited as particularly
signiﬁcant, ‘Powers new tenure
policy he developed while associate
provost.

During his career at Pitt, Powers
chaired countless committees in-
volving personnel policies, bud-
getary and planning concerns, and
directed or initiated projects such
as the University Honors Program,
while teaching classes in world
politics and Chinese government.

In July of 1978,. Powers visited
China with a delegation from Pitt
headed by Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, primarily to establish an
exchange program. Upon his
return, Powers engaged in dis-
cussions with officials of the

Chinese embassy in Washington,
D.C., resulting in a comprehensive

faculty exchange program with

sister colleges in China.

The projects Powers regrets not
seeing through is the recently
published, comprehensive pam-
phlet called “Planning Policies for
the 80’s” which ‘details plans for
each department over the next
decade.

“He kept pushing it ahead.‘ It
would have been completed with-
out him but not in this form,” said
staff assistant Nancy White.

“The University of Pittsburgh
has a very bright future,” said
Powers. “Planning for the next
decade involves exciting programs
and program development.’ ’

The stumbling blocks, said
Powers, are money and politics-
“The things we wanted were too

simple and straight forward.”
Powers said the state government
makes programs here “over-
regulated and over-bureau-
bureaucratized. ’ ’

“The biggest problem facing
Pitt,” said Powers, “is getting
adequate state support.”

In conjunction with 1-‘cwers’
reputation as a doer, innovator and
initiator who played a key role in
countless projects at the university
that have had a major impact,
many of his colleagues expressed
sentiment about his departure in
mid-July, saying he will be missed
mostly for his presence and
involvement with others.

“When I had a problem and
didn't want to formalize it by going

to a higher level, I went to Dave.

He showed good judgement and
always gave a good hearing,” said

Griffin.

“He accomplished goals in a
way that involved people ‘ with
diverse interests and personalities
and satisﬁed the most people,”
said Dr. Leonard Kuntz, deputy
director for the Ofﬁce of Research
and Powers’ colleague for the past

10 years.
.Former CAS Dean Robert
Marshall said that despite a

proclivity to debate with Powers
over academic issues, Powers is “a
hard thinker who gives very serious
consideration to intelligent is-
sues.” L 1

“In terms of the enthusiasm and
spirit he conveyed, everyone
wanted to work with him.

His responsiveness to his staff
and those who worked with him,”
said White, “speaks best for
affirmative action.”

FRESHMEN

As a freshman you may be wondering how you can get the best
  educational return for the time, money, and hard work you’ll invest
during the next few years. 4
Consider how the University Honors Program might fit into your
educational picture. * 1  
The UHP is an undergraduate program designed to help capable
and motivated students fully develop their academic abilities. The
foundation of the program is challenging and
stimulating course work.
Freshmen may register for UHP courses if they rank in the top 10%
of their graduating classes and have SAT scores of 1200 or above. A
freshman who does not meet these criteria, but who genuinely wishes
to register for an honors course, can do so with the consent of the
instructor. I      
This is what some of last term’s freshmen said about the University

Getting Your
Money’s Worth  

This weekend 124 carefully chosenand very com-
petent mentors will be doing their best to orientate
some 2,000 prospective freshmen with the University

of Pittsburgh.

It would be impossible for the new student to learn
every facet of this university in a weekend. This
means he will have to do a lot of discovering and ex-

ploring on his own in the fall.

Students will pay $1,630 for tuition alone this
coming year. If one chooses to live in the dorms that
expense is approximately $1,200. Add the cost of the
Student Activities Fee, Student Health Service Fee,
books and meal ticket and the true cost of Pitt will
exceed $3,000. That’s a good bit more than four
years, or even one year ago. And it’s not going to get

cheaper.

Questioning ORL’s Method of Administering Policy

By GARY TWEED

Last week, thirty students,
including this writer, who were
residents of the Pitt dormitories
during the fall and winter of
1978-79, were prosecuted by the
Office of Residence Life, for
violations of the Student Code of
Conduct. Charges stemmed from a
continuing problem, of vandalism
and theft in the Pitt dorms."
Over 100 students were charged for
violations of the code.

One cannot blame the ORL for
their move; they are faced with a
frustrating, recurrent, and costly
problem. But one can question the
methods by which this policy was
administered.

Blanket charges, issued over the
summer, are a cumbersome bother

for students. This is especially true
in a university which is attempting
to change its image from a cold.
impersonal monolith, to a caring
and devoted institution of higher
education. It is an unnecessary
inconvenience—and I speak here
from a personal experience—to be
charged with having university
owned.-furniture in your room.
What shocked me most about the
elusive charges which I received in
the mail, (of which I was found
innocent), was the total lack of
forethought which the university
displayed. One leading ad-
ministrator in the ORL was
unaware of what furnishings were
in the dorms--at least in Lothrop
Hall where I resided. This same
administrator said, “well, we’re
trying this policy out this year so
we can work‘ the bugs out of it.”

,_ “bugs”

But, the question arises as to
what “bugs” and at what price.
How many students were innocent-
ly inconvenienced while the
were found. (And
administrators worry about an
impersonal image?)

This hardly seems a rational
policy for a university with
declining enrollments to pursue.
Such a move can only serve to
antagonize students—especially
innocent students—and further
escalate the negative image of
Pitt—“the machine whose goal is
to manufacture diplomas.”

Certainly a problem with vanda-
lism and theft exists. But the
high-handed methodology imple-
mented by the ORL is only one
possibility—a possibility caused by
frustration rather than a careful
analysis of the problem. And what

of the real problem involved—the
real issue of people in this matter?
ORL seems not to care.

We must look at this situation
and ask the ultimate question.
It seems that the function of any
administrative office should be to
examine every alternative, every
aspect of a problem—its causes‘
and cures—and arrive at a rational,
sensible, and just solution. A
policy of frustration following past
policies of overlooking and neglect-
ing the issue for years hardly fits
the criteria for a rational, sensible
and just solution. Thus, we ask the
ultimate question of “what funct-
ion has the ORL?”

In deﬁning its role, the ORL
states, “Our only reason for
existing is to promote growth and
development of our students.

;..r.. st‘

{El

   

I'M LAD I ONLY HAVE TO CHANGE INTO THIS A FEW DAYS EACH YEAR.

_ sonnel

, the dorms?

It is under this concept that we
work, and such traditionally nega-
tive aspects of security and
discipline are viewed no longer as
being dictated from an unfeeling
monolith above, but as a means of
helping the group live together in a
community, insuring the protection
and enhancement of individual
rights and responsibilities.”

Is ‘growth and development’ of
students enhanced through puna-
tive measures? All too often this is
not the case. But from personal
experience, this is not the answer.
Speaking as a resident student of
three years, there is little that ORL
does to promote growth.

So what is the function of ORL?
Well, it does provide leadership
training through the Resident
Assistant program and by advising
the Resident Student Association.
But why then must they employ an
entire staff of professionals?
Student Government Board only
has one advisor, who also advises
many other groups. The Intel‘-
fratemity Council (22 fraternities)
and Pan-hellenic Association (17
sororities) only have one advisor.
The student media (The Pitt News
has over 90 employees alone) only
has one advisor. Yet, the Ofﬁce of
Residence Life has a director, two
assistant directors and staff per-
to advise 94 Resident
Assistants and the Resident Stu-
dent Association!

And what of promoting growth in
ORL does little.
They have developed ‘navel gaze’
and lost touch with the realities of
student life. Do they know what
students really want? That is
doubtful—they do not even know
what furniture is in the dormitory
rooms. Do they know students only
want a place to eat and sleep and
take Mary Sue? Do they know they
have failed in promoting any
community spirit on the ﬂoors, let
alone growth? Do they know why
they exist?

In a university as financially
troubled as Pitt, perhaps the senior
staff should be asking ‘what is the
function of ORL and what is the
cost?’ In a university where tuition
is skyrocketing, the ORL seems an
expensive luxury.

  THE BOOK CENTER
A Store Designed Especially for You

Our Purpose-Service

THE BOOK CENTER is owned and operated by the univ-
' ersity of Pittsburgh. The primary challenge facing the Book
Center today is one of extending service to the students of
the UNiversity, its many departments, faculty, staff and
alumni.

Organizational Structure

The Book Center is a departmental operation. Merchandise or

services offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments.

These are textbooks, new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All
buying for these areas is premised on three basic principles. All items
must be required for a given course of program of the University.
Items of this type are naturally the textbooks, used books and paper-

“: backs. Second, trade department items are made available that are
necessary to supplement and complement the course study and to en-
hance the cultural and academic-significance of the University. Third
supply department on the lower floor has supply items for your every
need: paper, notebooks, typewriters and hundreds of other items.

Fourth, sundries department has all the professional items, engineering

supplies, art supplies, stationary, pen and pencils and the availability of
many items.

The word “festival” brings to mind an
assortment of images; most commonly, a_

large gathering of people in a relaxed
atmosphere enjoying art, music, dance,
‘theater, foodand each other. The Three
Rivers Arts Festival ﬁts this description
nicely, and actually goes far beyond it. .

Held ‘June 8 through 17, the 20th
annual Festival could be described more

» simply as a celebration. Everyone who

attended, a visiting mayor or at local mill

worker, was part of the celebration,’

During ‘it's ten day run, the Festival
attracted -over 225,00 residents and
visitors to Gateway Center. . It was the
largest turn-out ever.

“I’ve had a real positive reaction,”, .

said John J ay_ earlier this "week as the
dismanteling of art pavillions, the Main
Stage and a massive clean-‘up begait. .
Jay is inhisﬁrst year as Festival
Chairman for the event which is

"sponsored by Carnegie Institute. ' He

cited as reasons lforthis years success
better organization, an A increased em-

phasis on the performing arts creating a
‘better balance in the overall program, the
coincidence of the »U.S. Conference of
Mayors and the American Council for the
Arts Conference on Arts Festivals and, of

» course, excellent weather.

Another factor leading to this years
success, according ' to Jay, was an
increase in both corporate and private
donation—both larger than ever before.’
And the general public has also rallied
behind the Festival. According to a
surveyldone by the Mayors Conference,
80%‘ of people asked said they would_ be
willing to. help support the Festival
through taxes. . _ t ‘

_ The festival opened with a keynote
address by Joan’ Mondale, known by
many as ‘4‘Joan of Art.” The

' Vice:President’s wife said she was very

impressed by Pittsburgh’s effort to make
such a wide variety of , visual and
performing arts available to the general
‘public. .

. , Here's a sample of exactly what was
make available: ' '

 , *more than 125 live performances were

fans and colleagues. About the ‘same
time the Pirates will be winding up the
baseball season, and the Steelers

Theater will be opening their tenth
anniversary season. ~,

Ballet is obviously quite different from 0

baseball or football, but as‘ far as
outstanding performance goes, and
pleasing fans, PBT is right up there with
the Steelers, and their rave reviews, and
91% attendance would make the Pirates
green with envy. As for season-training,
PBT’s dancers leave both clubs far
behind. They “tra'in”» six days ‘a week
with strenuous class in the morning, and
rehearsal from noon to 5:30-year-round, .
including performance days.

anti-trust laws. . _

n In this, the BMA’s initial conference, it
was ‘quit evident. that .the organization
places top priority on the business 'of

music, such as marketing,‘ distribution,

and promotion.’ The conference consisted.

-I of a series of workshops, meetings, and of

course, 'e_ntertainmen,t.' '
After. registration, the BMA’s mem-

bers and guests were-entertained by a _
' semi-lavish, cocktail reception sponsored ._

by A&M_frecords._ The reception gave a

sales and touring) neededto keep the
company going full force, ‘from outside

provide volunteer ofﬁce workers to help

already been said before.

But, his speech was," to say the least,
well-received. ~ Mostly because of what
Huey P. Newton once said; that people
don't listen to the true message that is
delivered ‘but rathersto the phraseology;
emphasis, and volumn of the sentence
spoken. Sadly enough, Dr. Sullivan
proved Huey’ Newton rightron that point.

Following Dr. Sullivan’s speech, the
audience was entertained by the BMA
ﬁlm, “Black Music The 70s.” "The ﬁlm
was a well arranged mixture of previously
used clips. Everyone wondered however,
where the better black acts of the 70s

, were. True, the ﬁlm did give attention to
Earth Wind & Fire, The Commodores,
The O’Jays, Chic and a lot of the other

_ more “commercial” black acts. But it is
‘absured to make a movie about black
music inithe 705 without including the
more creative and successful acts in the

industry, such as War, .Mandril and The v

- Ohio Players not to mention the BMA’s
to_tal ignoring of the entire jazz world.

Jazz, the music form which hasmade

American music. Without the creative

. as; Ragtime,

breakthroughs made by such jazz forms
Swing, BeBop, and of
course Blues, ‘such modern forms of

»music as; Rock, Soul, Fusion, R&B, and

,.even Disco would not have evolved. By
ignoring jazz, the BMA somewhat
showed that they were not whole-
heartedly promoting black music and
creativity in black music.

Following the ﬁlm, the BMA member-
ship was divided into divisions. These
divisions included communications, mer-

-chandising, performing arts and record-
' ing. These divisional meetings were very

business-like and showed the BMA’s

u .dedication to, the economics of black

music. This dedication can be easily seen
in the names of the divisions:
Communications: Job Security-A Van-
ishing Reality; Merchandising: Cooper-
ative Merchandising-The Realistic Alter-
na‘tive?; Performing Arts: Black Concert
Promoters-Getting A Fair Deal and
Recording: up Becoming A Corporate
Executive. The most interesting of these
sessions were the recording division

e headed by CBS Vice-president LeBaron

Taylor and the performing arts division
headed by Smokey Robinson of Motown
records. x

The recording session headed by
LeBaron Taylor placed emphasis on
becoming a record company executive.
Panelist William Hawkins spoke on the
requirements and procedures of becom-
ing- a record company executive.
Hawkins ‘spoke on the job of a
“headhunter" which is a person hired by
an executive and/or company to ﬁnd
executive material to ﬁll a give job slot.
The rest of the session continued along
the same lines as far as deﬁning the
procedures and qualiﬁcations of becom-
ing a recording company executive.

Arthur Miller’s Play Revived:

A scene from ‘The Price’, CMU’s first production of the summer season.

 Hie   Fantasticks: Popular Old Plot , But with New Twists

By MICHAEL McCABE

Directed by James Gardner v

University of Pittsburgh Theatre

At ﬁrst glance “The Fantasticks”
-bears a disturbing resemblance to
old-time melodrama. The three principal

ﬁgures are stamped hero, heroine. and‘

villain--while the plot follows the familiar
path. Granted, the villain is not
thoroughly villainous, and the plot does
take a few novel turns. When the facial

humor and the fine musical score are also

considered, the similarity begins to fade.

Still, in spite of these distinctions, the
musical retains better than average
potential for corniness. This production
skirts that danger however, and makes it
apparent why “The Fantasticks” has
such great popularity. It offers
amusement and warmth enough to reach
even the cynic.

The Price
Directed by Gregory Lehane
Carnegie-Mellon Theatre Company

Carnegie-Mellon Theatre Company
opened its fourth summer season this
Tuesday night at the Kresge Theatre with
Authur Miller’s “The Price”. Combin-

ing convincing and highly accomplished °

acting, elaborate staging and a sur-
prisingly intense story-line that explodes
in the second act, this play succeeds on all
levels.

Director Gregory Lehane has guided a
group of seasoned actors through an
emotional and inspiring production.
What begins as a seemingly light,
assuming comedy, quickly takes an about
face and becomes charged and impas-
sioned with the fervor of a climaxing
scene. p .

Basically, the plot revolves around a
reunited confontation of two brothers,
bitterly separated over the past 20 years
by shared and deep-rooted resentment.
They come together again as one brother
prepares to sell off a house full of family
heirlooms, abandoned ‘and all but
forgotten many years ago. When an aged
but digniﬁed furniture appraiser is
brought in, headstrong with his own
ideas,‘ a ﬁnal clash between the brothers
reals into motion.

harmonize on the romantic duets “Soon
It’s Gonna Rain” and “They Were You.”
However, their acting does not always
equal their singing, and they could be
more convincing in the first act. The
youthful exuberance they radiate is a bit
strained, and not completely natural.

In the second act, where Louisa and
Matt mature, Brown and Cotter gain
more credibility. Ronald A. Wisniski,
who plays the narrator-bandit El Gallo, is
quite effective in giving this two-fold
character the requisite air of authority.

in ‘Hie-Pn'oe’ of Brotherhood

Outstanding performances are regist-
ered by the entire four-person cast but it
is the talented Michael Gorrin as Gregory
Soloman that steals the spotlight.
Gorrin’s portrayal of the insipid, nosey
but lovable appraiser comes off with an
unequaled zest and mastery.

A veteran of 45 years‘ on the stage,
Gorrin has appeared in many Broadway
productions including “Checking Out,"
“The Sound of Music," “All Over
Town," and “Zalman or the Madness of
God” as well as many motion pictures
such as “Slow Dancing in the Big City”
and “The Taking of Pelham, One, Two
Three.”

Leland Starnes also turns in a
particularly exciting role. His portrayal of
the stubborn. malcontent Victor Franz
leaves the audience feeling the frustra-
tions and disappointments that have
hounded his character throughout his life.

.Rounding out this superb case is
Elizabeth Orion in the role of Esther
Franz, the equally circumvented wife of
Victor and Michael Pierce as the
humbling Walter Franz. Both add depth
and professionalism to this highly
recommended show,

Originally produced on the New York
stage in 1968, “The Price” was revived
this spring and a production of it is
currently playing on Broadway. But you
don't have to go all the way to Broadway

to see some outstanding theatre.

But Jim Diederjch is the one who most
totally immerses himself in his role.
when he takes the stage, one sees only
Matt’s ludicrous father Hucklebee, never
the slightest glimpse of the action playing
Hucklebee.

There are no disappointments in either
the rest of the cast or in any of the
technical aspects of the performance.

“The Fantasticks” is being held over
for six additional performances in the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre; June
22-23, 29-30 and July 6-7, all at 8 p.m.

Molars and Fooﬂights - A
Thespian Dental Student

By MARK HOLAN

Steve Guttenberg has the perfect
answer for handling a unique and
incredibly heavy schedule which keeps
him busy almost twenty-four hours a day.
He won't sleep at all this year, he’ll sleep
all of next year. Maybe. But he doubts it.

Who is Steve Guttenberg and what's
keeping him so busy?

Guttenberg is ' a 20-year-old native of
Brooklyn, New York, currently residing in
California where he is in his third year of
a six-year dental program at UCLA. He's
also an up-and-coming actor with a role in
the recently released “Players.”

As you might guess, anyone undertak-
ing dent—school and an acting career at
the same time has got to be very
ambitious, conﬁdent and have a lot of
energy to burn. Guttenburg meets all
three qualfications.

At the beginning of this month.
Guttenberg was in town for the
Pittsburgh premiere of “Players."
During an interview at the Hilton Hotel.
he continuously rocked on two legs of his
chair and never stopped using hand
gestures while he elaborated at a
lightening-pace on his past. present and
future.

“I was a‘ runner on Madison Avenue
always running here and running there.
doing things for other people. Itqccurred
to me one day that I should start doing
things for myself." said Guttenberg.

What Guttenberg did for himself was,

get into the High School of Performing
Arts. From there he moved onto John
Houseman’s Julliard Workshop. the
Nassau Repertory Theater and several

other New York theatrical establish-
ments.‘ As he moved on, Guttenberg
became more determined to move up.

‘I have two main heroes." said
Guttenberg. “One is Sylvester Stallone
and the other is Abraham Lincoln. Both
we're poor boys who had dreams, they
wanted to get there, to the top. and they
did. You know why? Because they
believed in themselves and they believed
in what they wanted to do.”

Suddenly Guttenberg’s wild gesturing
and excited speech stops. He pauses for
a breath and continues sincerely: “I
believe in myself and in what I want to
do."

Guttenberg took his sense of deter-
mination out to California in 1975. He
began hanging around studio lots,
reading trade magazines and getting
himself psyched for the day that he would
be so bold as to storm a casting director's
office and “demand" a part.

Which he did—several times in fact.
The result?

“A few bruises.” Guttenberg confided
with a smile. “But I did get the part in
“Something for Joey.”

His appearance in that TV movie led to
a feature role in “The Chicken
Chronicles” and later to the lead in “Billy
Liar." And as if this wasn't enough.
Guttenberg also took a full credit load at
UCLA's night school.

“It’s hard but I've learned to manage
my time.” said Guttenberg in a voice that
implied “but for me it's cake. Ihappen to
know that I can do anything I want.”

Ambition. Confidence. Energy. No
doubt about it. Guttenberg’g got all
three. He also has offers for the future.

_.

Steve Guttenberg has two career goals; acting and dlenistry.

not only as an actor. but also as a
producer.
And the degree in denistry?

“Something to fall back on,” said
Guttenberg. “There’s just no way I’m
not going to succeed.”- '

T wo -Talesof Love Mixed with ' First Bite’ and ‘Promise’

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Two love stories——one traditional. one a
satire—“The Promise" and “Love at
First Bite" have one thing in common:
both are lousy. ‘

“The Promise" is a shmaltzy romance
that pairs Stephen Collins and Kathleen
Quinlan as lovers who lose and regain
each other.

They plan to wed. but his snobbish
mother (Beatrice Straight) hires a
detective to uncover the prospective
daughter-in-law’s past. A few minor
quibbles in her heritage convince Straight
that Quinlan will bring nothing but
embarrassment to her prestigious archi-
tectural firm—which Collins will inherit.

The lovers plan to elope. but are
involved in a terrible car crash. When
Collins revives from a coma, Straight tells

him his fiance is dead. Of course. it's just
a vindictive mother’s scheme.

Quinlan went head first through the
windshield. and under layers of gauze
which cause her to resemble a -flattened
snow man.. she is hideously scarred.
Naturally, she lacks sufficient funds to
pay.for corrective surgery. Straight offers
to pay the bills. on the condition that
Quinlan never seeks out Collins.

And from that predictable beginning
comes the inevitably predictable end.
Sometimes. films of this sort (“Love
Story" is a notable example) are saved by
the score. the cinematography or the
acting. No such luck with “The
Promise."

While Quinlan is far more appealing
after her surgery, she gives a flat-voiced
and ﬂat-footed performance. Looking like
the result of a perverse match between

Tonto (of Lone Ranger fame) and Lily

‘Tomlin, Quinlan is a stiff and stagy

actress. Collins, who looks remarkably
like a young Robert Wagner. fares a little
better. but he is done in by the script.

The grain of film used to shoot “The
Promise” is reminiscent of that used in
K-Mart commercials and the‘ score is far
beneath the considerable - talents of
Melissa Manchester, who struggles
gamely with the insipid lyrics.

“Love at First Bite” is a spoof of the
Dracula pictures. George Hamilton, of
the wet seal hair" and the jet set
reputation, is actually good as the
transplanted Transylvanian who arrives
in New York for some fresh blood. He is a
witty and sexy Dracula and his- polished
elegance. right down to that disdainfully
raised eyebrow. verges on self-parody.

And the film, like Hamilton, is stylish

and good fun. The problems are the
script and the leading lady——Susan St.
James. .-

St. James, bleached blonde for the
role, is’ shrill and spaced-out. Her voice
cuts across sharper than Hamilton's
fangs gash into her neck. One almost
expects her to shrief “Mac” as in days of
yore when she was the latter half of
television's “McMillan and Wife.”

The script, very tongue-in cheek, tries

-too hard to catch every possible pun.

There’s a lot to be said for silent humor
but “Love at First Bite” opts for
verbalizing. Scenes where Hamilton

whirls St. James around at the disco are
fun; but when St. James extolls Dracula
to her analyst (played by Richard
Benjamin in yet another. wasted perfor--
mance) things start becoming ludicrous
and stop being amusing.

Alien: A Different Kind of Honor Flick - Monster in Space

By GARY L. TWEED

Alien
Directed by Ridley Scott

Many contemporary movie-goers shy
away from scare-ﬂicks. The monsters
always look rubbery and jaded——some-
thing my kid brother might manufacture
with playdoe. The music is disjointed,
always played in a minor key, and
foreshadows the monster each time.
Some people, in fact, have sworn off the
possibility of a movie ever keeping them
in suspense——until “Alien.”

“Alien” differs from your normal
scare-ﬂick. The music and soundtrack
are noticably subdued in order to make
you listen closer and draw you deeper into

"the ﬁlm’s mystery. The foreshadowing,

such as the womb-like entrance of the
alien vessel is a thread in the ﬁlm but not
posing as the entire fabric or plot.

And the monster! The monster is both
convincing and frightening. It comes into
the film in brief ﬂashes like some dire and
evil creature from a nightmare. You see
it and try to rationalize it as an illusion,
something unreal. But that prevailing
‘sense of evil, that unconscious, instinc-
tive lust for power prohibits even this
escapist pretext. ‘

Picture yourself as one of seven
members of the space~mining ship
“Nostromo.” You have collected a full
load of uranium ore and are headed back
to Earth. Due to the length of your
journey, you enter the hyper-sleep tanks
and will awaken automatically to re-enter
the Earth’s atmosphere. All is well.

You awake, but instead of nearing
Earth you are in another solar system.

The onboard ship computer, “Mother,”

informs you that it has traced a distress
signal from this planet. And, as
the directive from the mining company
orders, you must investigate any sentient
signal for help. You land on the planet’s
surface. and the drama of ‘ ‘Alien” begins.

Directed by Ridley Scott, who made his
feature ﬁlm debut in 1977 with “The
Duellists,” has made a masterpiece of
suspense and terror. Riddled with
masterful special effects, “Alien” gross-
ed more than “Star Wars” during its ﬁrst
two weeks.

“Alien” features the outstanding
acting of Tom Skerritt, who plays Captain
Dallas of the space-tug “Nostromo.”
Skerritt has appeared in “The Turning
Point” and earlier in the original ﬁlm cast
ofv“M*A*S*H.” '

Sigourney Weaver plays an exceptional
role as Ripley, the space-tug’s warrent
ofﬁcer. “Alien” is Weaver’s motion
picture debut as she plays the unwitting
heqoine of man.

Each scene of “Alien” is an explosive
cinematic gas-tank of thrillful special
effects and edge-of-your-seat suspense.
The ﬁlm is already a sure winner at the
box ofﬁce and promises to keep audiences
enthralled for years. a

“Close Encounters” may have been a‘

pleasant possibility but “Alien” is its
underside—a horrifying trip into the
future.

The performing arts division was
somewhat different. .It entertained the
‘questions and problems of the black
promoter. At times the discussion
became quite heated, especially when the
activities of certain musicians and
booking agents were brought up. Any
time the practices of acts such as Teddy
Pendergrass and Parliment/Funkadelic
was introduced an argument would soon
follow. \

The controversy surrounding Teddy
Pendergrass and Parliament/Funkadelic
was caused by the act's reluctancy to deal
with black promoters and black-owned
establishments, even though the black
community makes up most of their album
and concert revenue. The audience
(almost exclusively promoters), got out of
hand often and had to be calmed down
almost /every 20 minutes. Smokey
Robinson and Dick Griffey did a very
good job of answering the promoters
complaints and questions even though

their points of view were not always
accepted by the crowd.

Following the divisional sessions, there
was a general session called “Black
Music and Black Artist In The 80’s”.
The~panel headed by BMA Executive
Vice-President Ed Wright, concerned
themselves with the problems of disco
music and certain marketing techniques
and packaging of black music.

After the mid-evening cocktail recep-
tion given by Casablanca Record and Film
works, came two of the more interesting
events of the entire conference; Earl
Graves’ speech and the fantastic shows
given by Bob Marley and the Wailers.

Earl G. Graves, one of the truly
successful black businessmen in the
country, gave a startling speech.
Graves heads ﬁve corporations, including
two radio stations and is the publisher of
Black Enterprise Magazine, the foremost
journalistic chronicle of Black economic
development in the United States.
Graves’ speech was a very discontending

delivery of the present economic state of
the Black people in America.

Graves’ speech was in a somewhat
comical position; after dinner and before
Bob Marley and the Wailers. He played
it off with humor. First he asked
everybody to stretch so that they would
not fall asleep on his speech. No one fell
asleep.

Graves started by defining the needed
goals of black youth, such as accomplish-
ment in the math and science ﬁelds, and
economically dominating their only real"
resource; their talent.

Saturday’s dinner and show was
sponsored by Warner Brothers Records.
The performance was given by the
outstanding reggie group, Bob Marley
and the Wailers. The ten piece band
began their late night performance with
it's hit “Reursta Man” and the show got
better from that point. Bob Marley did
everything but short-change the very
enthusiastic audience. Stand-out per-
formances were done on the songs

Ghost Story
Peter Straub T
Coward, McCa.nn & Geoghegan

In the classic tradition of Poe,
Hawthorne and James, comes Peter
Straub and his latest effort, “Ghost
Story.”

The dialogue describes a crazed young
man kidnapping a strangely calm little
girl and their drive into Florida. It ends
with the little girl asking a confusing
question of the man and his subsequent
nightmare.

The scene then shifts to a group of four
elderly men who meet by means of a club
called the Chowder Society, where they
tell each other frightening stories and

scare each other into nightmares...or so
they think.
The old men's tales are scary, indeed.

In fact, one of them has a great bearing '

on the development of the novel. The
characters in his real-life horror story
become important actors in the attempt to
destroy the Chowder Society.

The plot develops slowly, but interest-
ingly, as Straub employs the residents of
the tiny town of Milburn to develop the
plot. There are countless stories within
the story, nightmares of the main
characters’ superstitutions and tales’ of
werewolves to further enhance the story's
development.

Although the reader is sometimes
confused as to what is happening, things
are cleared up quickly enough to preserve
the reader’s interest.

One problem with the novel is the soap

opera-ish way in which Milburn’s.

residents are tied in with each other. It
seems as though each male-female
combination possible has occurred.
Also, the characters’ nightmares and
hallucinations tend to get confused with
the story, because Straub has done such a
good job of blending these events in with

i the real story before the reader ﬁnds out

that it really ‘was a hallucination.

“Ghost Story” is actually three
“mini-novels” within a novel and each
ties in wonderfullywith the others before
the book ends. Each “mini-novel”
involves a beautiful, mysterious and
seemingly harmless- female with the
initials A.M.

The book is long at 483 pages, but it
really is hard to put down. At first, this is
because of the total confusion as to the

purpose of the prologue, and then to ﬁnd
out what the supernational force is and
why it continues to haunt this tiny town.

Since the story is set in modern times,
it is quite easy to identify with many of
the characters, especially a high school
boy who mistakenly gets caught up in the
story late in the book.

A shocking ending awaits the reader as
the epilogue ties everything and everyone
(who hasn’t already ‘been tied in)
together. It also explains the cover
illustration, incidentally.

“Ghost Story” is a delightfully eerie 

novel which at times doesn’t seem all that
impossible a happening. The reader
finds himself caught up in the action,
cheering for the heroes and hissing the
villains. No confusing titles here—it’s a
ghost story, at its very best.

Illuminati Conspiracy  who Rules me world?

By GARY L. TWEED

The Illuminoids
Nell Wilgus

Conspiracy theorists are so plentiful
today that one wonders if paranoids are
being released from institution, and then
writing books. Conspiracy theorists are
most painfully apparent in any sober
discussion of the Il1uminati—the secret
Barvarian society which is reputed to
have been involved in the conspiracies
behind everything from the French
Revolution, to the JFK assassination, to

Jimmy Carter’s presidential bid.

Research into Illuminati history could
evolve in three diverse ways. If one had
access to Illuminati archives, the
complete story could be told. Lacking this
direct access, theorists come in-ﬁlling the
gaps in the story with their own contrived
fantasies. A third method exists: re-
porting on what people have said about
the Illuminati.

Neil Wigus’ book, The Illuminoids
attempts this approach. Wilgus’ book is
the most objective reference yet

published on the Illuminati. It seems,
however, that these accounts are based
on a definition of the Illuminati which is
twofold: that the Illuminati involves
anything revolutionary or anything
conspiratorial.

By conspiratorial, Wilgus seems to
mean any coincidence which surrounds
an event of a gathering of key leaders,
which indicates they may have met
during that certain period in time.

For instance, the Trilateral commis-
sion, whose members included Jimmy

Carter, Walter Mondale, Cyrus Vance,
Zbignew Brezezinski, Michael Lumen-
thal, and Andrew Young, is credited with
the election of our current president.

The reports that Wilgus cites tend to be ._

speculative, and include politicans,
spiritual leaders, artists, businessmen,
and Freemasons. In fact, anyone who
even remotely revolted against the
current status quo and caused growth in a
society could, by Wilgus’ definition, be
Illuminati.

Jamey Does it Your Way

Jouneyg/Graham Parker and The Rumour
Stanley Theatre .
June 2, 1979
By SCOTT MOWRY

How do you like your acid rock these
days? Served up hard and heavy with the
nostalgic feel of chords gone by or sweet
and squeaky-clean with that Seventies
gloss? Any way you like‘ it, Journey does
it your -way.

On stage at the Stanley Theatre, Journey
unleashed a barrage of their easy-listen-
ing heavy metal that left even their most
ravenous fans with a glow of satisfaction.
Playing before a throbbing packed house,
this fivegpiece band from San Francisco
turned over all the right tricks that have
worked countless times before.

With power chords, big beat drumming
and lush vocal ‘harmonies fed at an
ear-splitting volume level. _With all the
prances, poses and posturing that could
be asked of a stuff-jeaned, long haired,
high-priced rock star, Journey triumph-
antly whipped the adoring I fans of
Pittsburgh into an uncontrollable frenzy.

Still, the two-hour-plus set had its
moments like the straight and powerful
“Next” from their third album of the
same name and “Lights” and “Wheel in
the Sky” from last year's ‘Inﬁnity.” Even
some of the newer, more commercial stuff
from “Evolution” like “Just the Same
Way” and “Lovin’,Squeezin’, Touchin”’

showed signs of inspiration. And for all
their ﬂuff and pomposity, the individual
; members of Journey generated unaboun-
ded enthusiasm and good nature.

But unfortunately, most of the sixteen
or so songs Journey performed this night
quickly suffered from weak repetition.
Every number was ﬁlled with the same
incessant jams breaks from guitarist Neal
Schon and the shrill pretty boy crooning
of lead singer’ Steve Perry. More often
than not, where one song ended and
another began was impossible to
distinguish.

 Yet this Pittsburgh audience obviously
got what they came for. Judging from
their shrieking, practically maniacal
response this show would have to be

AA

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

dubbed nothing short of successful. But
this “success” makes failure somehow
seem attractive.

If anything, this concert provided, a
study of contrasting musical styles,
Where Journey relied on high school
romanticism, hippie guitar licks, and a
deafening bombardment of sound,
opening act Graham Parker and The
Rumour displayed basic, gut-bucket,
raw-nerved rock n’ roll.

Parker and The Rumour’s energetic
45-minute set was propelled by the uncut
emotion of an intense repertoire of songs
that spanned over four albums. Most of
the music during this show highlighted
the group's latest LP, “Squeezing Out
Sparks,” their best selling record to date.

With the tight, no frills approach by
The Rumour furnishing a sturdy musical
backdrop, Parker freely stalked the Stan-
ley stage, spitting out his vocals and
twisting his wiry frame to accentuate the
words. As Parker’s voice meshed
perfectly with the searing lead guitar of
Brinsley Schwarz, each of the 11 songs
performed this night soared with a
freshness and spontaneity. Opening
number “Discovering Japan,” “Local
Girls,” and “Soul Shoes” made this
chemistry immediately apparent. .

Whether he was pounding his fist into
his palm on songs like “Passion Is No
Ordinary Word” and “Protection” or
pointing his finger accusingly on
“Nobody I-Iurts You,” “Tear Your
Playhouse Down” and “Don’t Ask Me
Questions,” Parker bled excitement.
Unfortunately, too few of the Stanley
onlookers felt his fury and consequently
Parker spent a lot of time vainly
squeezing out some response.

With their music, Parker and The
Rumour intend to provoke some kind of
reaction", one way or another. Sadly, they
got little this night.

At one point in the show, as he was
introducing “Don’t Get Excited,” Parker
asked the passive crowd to do exactly
opposite of what the song says. They
didn’t and instead saved every bit of their
own excitement for Journey. There’s no
justice in popular taste.

Breakfast in America:
  Supertramp I/gision

I By MARK HOLAN

Supertramp
Civic Arena
June 4, 1979

In one of the more hyped concerts so
far this summer, Supertramp made its
Pittsburgh debut early this month at the
Civic Arena. The two and a half hour
concert was highlighted by tight
musiciansip, good song selections and
arrangements, effective and graciously
used visuals leading to an overall
impression that the band, and its tour,
are well organized. And well worth
seeing too.

Good organization, manifest in the
quintet’s musicanship and commercial
success, seems to be at the vortex of
‘Supertramp. Sure, Ron Wood and his
Barbarian friends can slap together an
all-star tour at the last minute and get
away with it, but that’s an exception. In a
business of many one night (album)
stands, Supertramp seems to have at
least one of the keys to longevity.

The concert began with Rick Davis
haunting harmonica intro to “School,”
one of Supertramp’s first hits. Curtains
rolled back revealing the band on a
modest stage. A srﬂali-"cafe'setting of two
chairs, a small table and parasol was set
in the back right.

“Jammin,” “Shot the Sheriff,” “Light
Me Up Yourself,” and the dynamic
“Stand Up For Your Rights,” which
featured a special guest appearance by
Stevie Wonder.

Marley placed for about an hour and a
half before ending the show. The
response to the performance was so great
that the Wailers returned and played four
encore numbers ending with a breath-
taking performance of the hit “Exodus.”

Sunday’s activities began on a religious

A note with thebreakfast meeting hosted by

Andre’ Crouch and Light Records. The
breakfast featured a tribute to Phila-
delphia’s Dixie Hummingbirds for their
nearly ﬁfty years of gospel performing.
After many speeches and delays, the
packed house was entertained by the
Hummingbirds, a ﬁve-man vocal group,
displaying their strong voices and
magniﬁcent harmonies to the utter
delight of the BMA members and church
guests.

Following the gospel perfor_mance, the
divisional sessions reconvened to sup-
posedly “conclude and resolve all
outstanding matters from the previous
day’s activities”. As it was the day
before, the performing arts division was
the most interesting. Smokey Robinson,
divisional vice-president, delivered one

proposal of interest that all promoters put
their names and contacts on a list to be
sent to performing acts so they know the
black promoters in a given area.
Robinson also advised all the promoters
to join a BMA sub-division—the United
Black Promoters Association.

This organization is designed to react
directly to the needs of Black promoters.
The UBPA can also act as a middle-man
in certain disputes.

The meeting then continued from
where it had stopped the day before with
promoters and theatre owners arguing
and complaining about their problems
with certain booking agents and
peforming arts. At this point BMA
co-founder Stevie Wonder entered the
paneL

Wonder seemed upset about the
actions of the whole meeting. He asked
the audience to hold back on certain
individual complaints and speciﬁc prob-
lems dealing with speciﬁc people. He
pleaded with the promoters not to exploit
the BMA, but to use it wisely.
Robinson immediately intervened.

“That’s what we’re here for Stevie, to
hear these peoples’ problem and let it all
out. These people have been held baclr.
too long,” he said. “It’s time that they
were heard.”

The crowd applauded this statement
and then continued their gripes. One
intense argument went on between
promter/producer Dick Griffey and
Archie Ivy, manager of Parliament/ F unk-
adelic. It seems that Parliament/Funk-
adelic has always used white promoters
and white establishments for their
concerts even though their constituency is
almost 90% black.

Ivy denied this and the argument went
on for some 15 minutes or so before
Robinson broke it up. Griffey later
apologized for his outburst, but Parlia-
ment/Funkadelic and Ivy seemed to lose
some friends that day.

Following the corporate meeting and
the Atlantic records cocktail reception,
was the dinner hosted by CBS records.
After dinner was served the BMA and
CBS presented awards to The National
Association of Television and Radio‘
Announcers for their breakthroughs in
the advancements for equality in radio
and television.

, After the NATRA presentation, the
dinner audience was entertained by the
Emotions. The Emotions pushed sheer
energy into the Shearton from the start
and gave the audience what they came to
here with hit after hit: “Don’t Wanna
Lose Your Lose,” “Whole Lotta Shakin,”
“Smile,” “Don’t Ask My Neighbors,”

“Best of My Love,” “Rejoice,” and a
very special performance of the gold
single “Walkin the Line.”

The Emotions were below par at times
but overall they were adequate. Their
voices mixed like a choir of angels and the
audience just ate it up as hit after hit

flowed from their mouths. Upon ﬁnishing-

their show the Emotions gave a special
encore performance of the hit “Boogie
Wonderland” which appears on the latest
Earth, Wind & Fire album, “I Am.”

The BMA as a whole needs a lot of

work, but the energy is there and if given '

the proper artists support, it may live up
to expectations. In the future, the BMA
should give more attention to the
performers rather than the money they
generate. Because without adequate
performers, there will be no money.
Although economies are important,
especially today, when talking about
music, creativity should hold top priority.

Hopefully, future BMA conferences
will not be as dominated by the major
record companies as this one. They are a
problem because both use black music
and the black musician for their personal
and/ or corporate gain.

The BMA should continue to strive for
the betterment of Black Music and to
“Bring Minds Alive,” which was the
conference’s theme.

  Ballet - More Strenuous Than Most Would Believe

The man ’in front, clapping and

' shouting the moves, encouraging this

literally muscle-contorting behavior,
knows only too well this labor of love, for
he is a dancer himself——in addition to
choreographer and artistic director. He is
Patrick Frantz, a creative, energetic,
much-respected artist.

Frantz is responsible for much of the
artistic quality and recognition PBT has
attained.

Frantz becameartistic director of PBT
in February, 1978. Previously he was
with the Tucson Ballet as astistic director,
shaping that company from a small recital
group to a disciplined and crafted

? professional dance company in only three
years.

Frantz has choreographed ballets for
many well-kinown dance troupes, in
addition to his choreography - of the
contemporary “Firebird” for PBT. He
believes choreography (art of arranging
dances) provides a dancer with an
understanding of dance which is much
more complete.

“It adds creativity and gives a dancer
much more freedom...a broader idea of
dance,” he said. He thinks that
choreography is something a dancer
should pursue, instead of pushing it back
to the future when a dancer can no longer
dance.

In addition to an impressive career as a
dancer, Frantz has an equally impressive
background in music, which provides
another important dimension to his
artistry. At the age of 14, he was the
youngest person to win a national award

(Continued from page I 0)
The staging worked to the band’s
advantage. Davis, along with bassist
Dougie Thompson, reedman and ring-

master John Helliwell and vocalist/

guitarist Roger Hudson move around the
stage more than some hard rockers. It
isn't wild body movement, however, but
rather constant moving to and from
various instruments. Most notably, of
course, piano and synthesizers.

Supertramp wastedjlittle time before

jumping into material from it’s “Break-

fast In America” album. The LP has

in his native France, in a piano
competition sponsored by the prestigious
Paris Conservatory. He was studying
dance at the same time, and shortly after
receiving this award, he had to choose
which career to pursue, since both take
single-minded dedication; When asked
why he chose ballet, he replied that it was
not an easy decision to make at so young
an age, but, “dance uses order more than
any other art.”

To those who are not familiar with
ballet, but would like to view a
performance, Frantz suggests viewing
“Coppelia," because, “in addition to its

» comical and charming tale, it is not all

technical, and includes familiar folk
dance and mime.”

 

should H be seen 3 or 4 times, and

Tom Ruud’s “Statement” is also a
ballet for the beginning viewer because,
he says, “It matches more of what we are
facing in the 20th century.”

Frantz’s “Celebration,” premiering in
the fall in honor of PBT’s tenth
anniversary, is also geared for contem-
porary audiences. Its message is one of
“exalting the gift of life,” and asking the
question, “where do we go from here?”

Frantz suggests that one should “view
dance from the top, and far away,” for’ it
is “the best way to see the dimension,
and all directions at the same time.” This
is important, for Frantz believes one
should note the unique pattern in each
performance. He also says that a ballet

   
 

compares it to listening togood music.

“It may not be pleasant on the first‘

listening. One can appreciate it on more
listenings, for the more you listen, the
more you realize what you were
missing,” he said.

There is much to be learned and.
appreciated from the world of Pittsburgh,

Ballet Theatre. The members _visit
schools to educate children of the ballet
and perform at hospitals and institutions.
PBT conducts classes for non-profession-
als, is starting a school to train dancers
for professional careers, and conducts
over one hundred lectures a year.

One can start learning by seeing the
ballet. The season opens October 5 with
“Sleeping Beauty.”

 

Pittsburgh Ballet Theater perform in ‘Firebird’, choreographed by Patrick Frtz.

‘Breakfast In America’ Platter Served Live In Civic Arena

been sitting atop various music charts,
including Billboard and Rolling Stone for
several weeks.

“The Logical Song,” “Goodbye
Stranger,” and the title track were all
extremely well received. Later in the
show, “Take the Long Way Home” and
“Child of Vision” (featuring the
“Trampettes” or Moron Tablenacker
Choir) were also greeted with thunderous
applause from ‘the not-quite-sold-out
crowd.

Supertramp did not dwell on its hit
album, however. Selection from the

previously released “Crime of the
Century,” “Crisis, What Crisis?” and
“Even in the Quietest Moments” were
also performed.

Especially good was a string of songs
which included “Just a Little Bit,”
“Right, ' Quite Right” and “Dreamer. ”
Hudson's acoustic guitar rendition of
“Even in the Quietest Moments" was
also very good.

The most impressive visual effect of the
evening was a fast motion black and white

film shot from the front of a train racing_

down the track. It complimented the
band’s driving instrumentals perfectly.

If Supertramp continues to produce
material as good as its last album, and
continues to perform it as well as at this
concert, the band may soon become part
of music’s lunch and dinner as well as its
breakfast.

“Breakfast In America,” by the way.
consists of three cups of coffee, half a
grapefruit and eggs Benedict with
hollandaise sauce—out of the can. This,
at least, was Helliwell’s version.

Ten years after Woodstock, Alvin Lee remains a blistering guitarist;

Alvin Lee Provesﬂe can still
Rock Audiences ‘Ten Years Later’

By MARK MONAHAN

Alvin Lee
Stanley Theater
June 9,1979

Ten years ago, at the Woodstock Music
and Arts Festival, Alvin Lee and Ten
Years After became rock superstars when
they electriﬁed 300,000 people with their
blazing rock anthem, “Goihg Horne”.

Appearing recently at the Stanley
Theater, Lee and his new band, Ten
Years Later (Mick Hawksworth, bass and
Tommy Compton, drums) put on an
exhilirating two hour show of powerhouse
blues rock. It featured the unbelievably
lightening fast guitar leads and raw,
emtional vocals of Lee, one of the true
heroes of late 60s and early 70s rock.

Even though the mid and late 70s
haven’t been good to Lee in a commerical
sense (he didn’t have a record label from
1975 to 1978), it wasn’t surprising to see
the Stanely packed and rearing in
approval when Lee took the stage.

Dressed in a red shirt, torn jeans and
white tennis shoes, the blond haired Lee
is an unquestioned master of electric rock
guitar and a superb stage performer who
used his ﬂying ﬁngers to ﬁre up the
crowd instead of schlocky theatrics or
cheerleading tactics.

In terms of musical pacing and stage

delivery, Lee knows what he is doing.
With ﬁve stacks of Marshall Amps behind

him, Lee and band roared through a"

variety of songs from all phases of his
illustrious career.

“Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,” “I
Can’t Keep from Crying,” “Help Me,”

“Going Home? and the first encore tune, 1

“Choo Choo Mama,” represented some
of his ﬁnest work form the Ten Years
After day. “Ain’t Nothing Shakin,”
“Hey Joe,” “Scat Thing,” and “lt’s a
Gaz” were from his most recent albulms,
1978’s “Rocket Fuel” and the most
recent release, “Ride On.”

Hawksworth and Compton were a tight
and colorful rhythym section comple-
menting the talents of Lee, while being
highly impressive when soloing on their
own.

Hawksworth’s bass solo during “It’s a
Gaz” brought to mind the work of
Cream’s Jack Bruce, perhaps the finest
bassist in rock history.

Compton, no slouch himself, literally
shook the Stanley during “Ain’t Nothing
Shakin” with an intense and intricate
Workout on drums, while Lee and
Hawksworth, off to the two sides of the
stage,‘ threw a frisbee back and forth to
each other.

Hawksworth’s and Compton’s mo-
ments aside, Lee was the man people
paid to see and. he didn’t disappoint
anyone. -

Whether duckwalking across the stage
during “Sweet Little Sixteen,” using his
microphone stand as a slide during “Help
Me” and “Hey Joe,” or putting his
guitar solos in the faces of ‘the fans in
front of him‘during “Going Home” and

“Choo Choo MaMa,” Lee’s absolutely

awsome.

McGuinn, Clark and Hillman Fail «to Live Up to Expectations;
  .9 Amen'ca Reiums To Perfonn After Two-Year Absence

By GARY GRAFE

America

McGuinn, Clark and Hillman
Stanlev Theater

-June 19, 1979

There is something ironic about it; the

songs upstaging the fathers. In this case,
it was America, the Seventies prodigy of
folk/rock superstars like Crosby, Stills,
and Nash and The Byrds, who upstaged
the three leaders of the former band.

Not that the set by Rodger McGuinn,
Gene Clark, and Chris Hillman was
without merit; there was just plenty of
room for improvement. Most of this
could have come in the trio’s attitude,
which fell just short of obvious. Messrs.
McGuinn, Clark, and Hillman all
displayed different degrees of unfriend-
liness, with Clark seeming the only one
aware that there was an audience
present.

McGuinn_ played in his own little shell,
letting a guitarist he saw ﬁt not to
introduce take all the solos-. Hillman was

A content to play a plugging but sloppy bass

line into his ampliﬁers, not even facing
the crowd during his vocals.

After ruining a fine selection of songs
from their latest album, including “Long
Time.” “Surrender to Me,” and totally
butchering “Don’t You Write Her Off.”
MC&H finished strong with some old
Byrds numbers: “Tambourine Man” and

-» “Eight Miles High.”

Those two almost .weren’t played.’
As the Stanely audience called for an
encore, McGuinn was the only’ one
reappearing on stage, and had to beckon
several times to Hillman, who was
shaking his head in the wings, before the
encores were done.

McGuinn, Clark, and Hillman may not
be used to playing opening sets, and
hopefully the Stanley show wasn’t an
indication of their headline shows.
Otherwise, their reunion won’t last.

“‘We should be opening for them” was
what Dewey Bunnel told the audience
about MC&H. He and Gerry Beckley

,seemed almost guilty about headlining

over their former idols, but had no
reason to be. -

Beckley and Bunnel walked on to the
opening shuffle of “Riverside,” and
continued to shuffle good-naturedly
through a colelction of older favorites and
songs from “Silent Letter”, the first
album of original material in almost three
years.

And unlike their “support” act,
America let the audience know that it was
there for them. From the start, Bunnel,
Beckley, bassist David Dickey and
guitarist Michael Woods were bouncing
at the very edge of the stage, playing
hard enough to require guitar changes
after every song.

America also seemed to be brought
closer by Bunnel’s voice, which was
obviously troubling him. The entire band
pulled behind him, taking as much of the
load off as they could on choruses and
harmonies. » ‘

Bunnel pushed, though, and the
performances of “I Need You,” “Daisey
Jane,” and “Sister Golden Hair” worked
well.

The. new material was also well
received and sounded promising accented
by Jimmy Kalva’s sax: “Only Game In
Town,” the new single, was the best of
the bunch, with Beckley doing a powerful
vocal and “Foolin” came across as a nice,
upbeat rocker.

The surprise was a strong delivery of
“California Dreaming,” which America
performs on the movie soundtrack.
Beckley’s vocal sounded amazingly like
the original, and if you closed your eyes,
visions of the Mamas and the Papas
would probably enter your head.

Interspersed throughout the new
material, which America often failed to
introduce, was material from the greatest
hits pile. “Tin Man” was done without
its opening instrumental, but was as
powerful as ever. “Ventura Highway”
was just as good, with strong, lyrical"
acoustic lines from Bunnel and Woods.
“Then the Night Falls/When the Day
Breaks” was joined together into a

ﬂashy, dramatic number with tasteful
vocal echo effects.

And like on past tours, percussionist
Tom Walsh took a large share of the
spotlight, racing through an array of
‘instruments, often jumping form one side
of his platform to the other. His
xylophone solo “Drinks on Me” earned
him a standing ovation. ' ”

Then came “jam” time, and “Sandi
man” was entended with the entire band
slashing like a heavy metal unit.
“Horse With No Name” was the only
encore, and America left the stage
embracing and slapping each other on the
back.

The new materical had worked well‘,
and Beckley and Bunnel proved that
America’s creativity wasn’t crushed when
Dan Peek left the band two years ago.

Houserockers Good, Tycoon Bad, Hunter an Old Pro

By MARK HOLAN

Ian Hunter Band
Stanley Theater
June 17, 1979‘

Meatloaf’s hit single “Two Out Of
Three Ain’t Bad" is a good way to
describe last Sunday's triple bill show at
the Stanley which featured the Iron City
Houserockers, Tycoon, and the Ian
Hunter Band.

With a gold on black logo behind them,
the Houserockers opened the show to
shouts of “show ’em where you live.”
And the hometown band wasted no time
in getting the disturbingly small crowd on
its feet.

The Houserockers short set featured
songs from its debut album “Love’s So
Tough.” Included were the title track, a
rousing version of “Turn It Up” and
“Hideaway,” which is the album's most
aired song.

It is unfortunate that the Houserockers
had so little time—only half an hour.
Marc Reisman, the band's blistering
harmonicaplayer conﬁded after the show
that the Houserockers would have been
happy to play longer, but couldn’t ﬁght
the concert contract.

“We realized that we’re still at the
bottom of the heap,” he said.

Missing from the Houserockers set was
its trademark song ‘‘I’m Lucky (1 Can Still
Rock and Roll).” A driving rendition of
“The Joint is J umpin” made for an
excellent one song encore, however.

After a long intermission, the concert
continued with Tycoon. The six-member
band from New York proceeded to play an
hour of unnecessarily loud rock that
ranged in quality from mediocre at best to
dung in the sun at worst.

Tycoon was guilty of overplaying the -

rock stars on the road trip. Too much
“Hey we’re from New York,” “How ya
doin Pittsburgh” and “We’re going to a
Party” coupled with uncoordinated stage

mannerisims made these young boys
seem like complete fools.

Tycoon left the stage to a mixture of
boos and applause; the later being more
out of relief than regard.

Another long intermission followed,
but it was worth the wait when the Ian
Hunter Band, minus Ian Hunter, finally
began to play. A good instrumental
pience opened the set and established the
mood for the appearance of Hunter, who
launched into his hit “Once Bit
Ten/Twice Shy.” , -

Wearing a red and white striped shirt
and black vest, Hunter, with his
reddish-blond curls, famous shades and
swaggering stage mannerisms had the
complete air of an old pro. He was
confident, secure and appeared to be
having.a good time.

This was completely Hunter’s show.
Guitarist Mick Ronson was left complete-
ly in the shadows. Considering his
talents and long-standing relationship
with Hunter, the downplaying of Ronson
was both surprising and puzzling.

Highlights of the set included “Just
Another Night On The Other Side,” (an
as-yet unreleased single), “Cleveland
Rocks” and “Standing In My Light.”

The show ended with another old hit,
“All The Way From London” in which
Hunter complained about the small
crowd. Added to the end of the song was
the refrain of “Jumping Jack Flash.”

For his encore, Hunter did perhaps his
most well know song, “All The Young
Dudes.” It was followed by his newest
single, “When The Daylight Comes,”
from the recently released “Your Never
Alone With A Schizophrenic.” The live
version was by far superior to the studio
cut.

A bad mixing board, along with Tycoon
marred this concert that was good at the
beginning and good at the end. Once
again, two out of three ain’t bad.

Hyman and Washington Provide Audience   with Repertoire

By DAVID E. STUBBS

Phyllis Hyman/Grover Washington, Jr.
Stanley Theater 9
June 15, 1979

On Friday, June 15, Pittsburgh was
once again treated to another outstanding
‘ show at the Stanley Theater. This time it
was the return of Pittsburgh's own Phyllis
Hyman to the Stanley, along with modern
jazz favorite Grover Washington. Jr.

,Hyman started out the evening on the
right foot with a short performance—35
minutes—of sheer eloquence. Hyman
began her show with a light jumper called
“Living Inside Your Love." She
immediately followed with the energetic
“The Night Bird Gets the Love" from her
first LP. Hyman then mellowed with a
short monologue to the audience before
breaking into two smooth ballads, the
first of these being “The Answer is You,”
an unrecognized ballad written by Mark
Radish in 1975. The song sounded as if it
were tailor-made for Hyman. The
second, the Stylistics classic “Betcha By
Golly Wow.” was the song that she made
her professional debut with, on the
Norman Connors album “You Are My
Starship.”

Her next song was the very funky
“Lookin’ For Lovin‘,” in which the band
got into featured solos; which included
-bass, keyboards, drums, bass, guitar,
and percussion. The ﬁnal piece was
Hyman’s biggest hit, “Somewhere in My
Lifetime." She showed her true vocal
strength with this piece.

Hyman is very rarely complimented for

her versatility in a live show; but, people‘

who enjoy good music and have heard
Phyllis Hyman know that the two are
synonymous, one and the same. _

Now for the main event. Grover
Washington, Jr. is truly one of the more
innovative acts in modern jazz of the 705.
In a time when everybody deserts
creativity for commercial enrichment, he
succeeds in doing both. He remains
creative and innovative without losing
popular appeal.

Washington gave an exuberant per-
formance with another new band. lt's

’ somewhat of a mystery why Washington

changes bands nearly every two albums.
but he never ceases to find talented
Philadelphia musicians. He performed
ten pieces. each of which was so special
and alive that they all should be
mentioned

The first cut was the ultramellow title
cut from his latest album, titled
“Paradise,” which came alive with great
improvisation. The primary solos were
those of Washington on soprano sax and
George Howard on electric lyricon. A
lyricon is an instrument that recreates an_
electronic mixture of the reed instrul

ments, clarinet and flute and resembels a S

recorder. When played correctly, the
lyricon can be a very beautiful and mellow
instrument, and Howard played it just
that way.

The next tune was the ﬂowing “Santa
Cruisin'," from Washington’s “Reed
Seed’ album. This proved to be an
easygoing piece with some interesting
rhythm changes. The solos were by
Washington on soprano sax, Howard on
lyricon, James Bradley on piano, and a

man introduced as “Skeet” on guitar.

The next dynamic piece was the super
mellow “The Answer in Your Eyes,” for
all the critics who think that Washington
can’t “throw down” on the tenor sax. The
song featured a stunning guitar solo, and

once again lyricon by Howard.

Washington then reached into his
earlier album, “Feels So Good,” for an
incredible performance of the title cut.
He o'nce again stunned non-believers with
his tenor sax work. After his ten minute
feast on “Feels So Good,” he led the
band into their version of Billy Joel's 1978
Song of the Year, “Just the Way You
Are," a song Washington recorded on his
‘{Reed Seed” album. Also from “Reed
Seed" was a very rhythmic performance
of the tune “Steppin' Thru," in which the
band just completely let loose and left the
audience in a state of awe. He continued
with three cuts off his latest album, the
first of these titled “Asia's Theme,” and
the second was the "B” side of the new
Washington single. “Feel It Comin’,”
another tune that enthralled the
audience. And as if that wasn't enough,
he followed with the “A" side of that
single. the funky “Tell Me About It
Now." which once again featured
Washington on the tenor saxophone.

After “Tell Me About It Now" the
crowd went into a tive—minute standing
ovation. When Washington and company
returned. it was with the ever-popular
Ralph McDonald classic, “Mr. Magic,”
sort of Washington’s theme song. The
audience clapped and grooved as the
familiar lines of this song just filled the
air with great musicianship.

   

Washington is notorious for outstand-
ing live performances—-—remember the
ever-popular “Live at the Bijou” album?
As mentioned before, he changes bands

frequently. A comparison with his former -
band, Locksmith, is very hard to do. The ‘

major difference would have to be the
replacement of Locksmith violinist John
Blake with lyriconist Howard. The
transition comes off very well.

I

A J Gover Wshinto Jr.» turned the

1..

When listening to Washington perform
live, the viewer can almost feel him
disappear into the music. He seems to
dematerialize, and only shadow remains.

Hopefully, he will not get lost in the
commercialism that plagues so many
other popular artists like himself. But
until that day, if ever, Washington will
remain one” of the best _musicians that
modern jazz has to offer.

Surprisingly, Nugent’s New Album Not ‘Shocking’ Enotgh

By GARY GRAFF

Ted Nugent
State of Shock
Epic Records

This is the kind of album that leaves the
listener in a real state of shock; shock that
Epic records would accept it as a
marketable product, and then have the

nerve to slap it with an $8.98 list tag on it.

Like one song says, you really have to‘
“Bite Down Hard” to take Ted Nugent’s
hodgepodge of borrowed riffs and

-obsolete heavy metal hooks. You have to
'bite down harder when Nugent and

Charlie Huhn deliver what they call
“vocals.”

The best thing that Nugent and his
band do on “State of Shock” is a copy of

\

By GARY L. TWEED

Triumph
Just A Game
RCA

Words and music synthesize together
as we journey through the cosmic
awareness of Triumph’s new album: Just
A Game. And if we are to believe RCA’s
hype, Triumph “transcend(s) the nor-
mally limited boundries of mega-decibel
rock” while “crowds from across the land
have risen in frenzied unison to salute the
new ‘kings’ of the rock domain.”

While these may be the exaggerated

truths of P.R. people, there is deﬁnite
applause in store for the Canadian band.

Secondly, from the sound of his last two
albums, Nugent made a big mistake
separating from his original band: Derek
St. Holmes (guitar, vocals) Bob Grange
(bass), and Steve Nissal (drums). St.
Holmes had twice the vocal range that
Huhn has, and could even supply his own
guitar breaks as a refreshing alternative
to Nugent’s redundancy. Walt Monag-
han (bass) and Cliff Davies (drums) plod
along, while Nugent’s original rhythm
section played with a degree of snap.

The incompetence of the new players is
well exhibited on “State of Shock’s,”
grind-drone rockers like “Paralyzed,”
“Satisfied,” and an incredibly poor track
called “Snake Charmer.” The guitars
grind, the drums thump, the bass drones,
and every now and then Nugent takes his
lead off into some limitless tangent.

SC '9

The sounds created by the band’s trt .

members, guitarist Rick Emmett, drum-
mer Gil Moore, and Mike Levine on bass

and keyboards, is unparalled in rock

except, perhaps, for Rush. Emmett is an
especially talented but underrated
guitarist of the ﬁrst caliber.

“Just A Game” is more varied in tone
and style than was the previously
released “Rock And Roll Machine.”
Levine described the new album, “This
new record shows how Triumph has
grown and matured asa band. There’s
still plenty of high-energy rock and roll,
and we've managed to include some
rather melodic material as well.” And
“Just A Game” is just that, powercord
rock and roll, and melodies.

The album begins with “Movin On,” a
high energy rock piece with outstanding

the George Harrison penned “I Want to
Tell You.” The quartet takes an
interesting twist away from the original’s
poppish, light guitar lines, substituting
some growling, riffs and a loud drum
beat. The vocals are even credible on this
song.

That's about it for redeemable material
on “State of Shock," though. The rest is
rather mindlessly written, and tediously
performed, paling even to the dismal
“Weekend Warriors," released in
February.

Something must have happened when
Nugent shaved off his unkempt mous-
tache and whiskers. He looks a shade
more presentable now, but his music has
lost the biting, heavy metal edge of his
ﬁrst three albums that made the “gonzo
kid” appealing.

Canada's Triumph lust ‘Playing A Game '

guitar rifts by Emmett. “Lay It On The
Line” is another powercord piece. But it
is also a love song which tells of the point
in a relationship where both parties must
be totally honest and “lay it on the line.”

“Young Enough To Cry” comes from
the blues tradition in rock. It’s about a
girl who has\"~plit from her man who gets
drunk to forget. The words and music
bring back those dim lit memories of
staggering down steps, streets, and dark
alleyways.

“American Girls” is done in a
Hendrix-style high-energy rock. Listen-
ing to the song, one can’t help but
reminiscent of “American Woman” by
the Guess Who.

Side Two contains the more melodic
material. “Hold On” is a refreshing
piece of acoustic guitar musicianship.

Drummer Davies is also the co-pro-
ducer of the album (with Lew Futterman)
and wisely buries his drumming low ir
the mix. Except, naturally, when he
shouldn’t, like on “Alone,” a very poor
slow blues number that cries for a good,
loud drum beat to drive it; or at least
drown out the whining guitar line and
pitiful vocals.

Then there’s “It Don’t Matter” and
“Saddle Sore,” two fast movers that both
sound like “Cat Scratch Fever” with
three-bar ﬁnishes. It’s the closest the
album comes to exciting, but “State of
Shock” still falls short.

One thing is for sure; Ted Nugent will
never give up rock ’n’ roll and play disco,
no matter how bad his albums get. Maybe
someone should ship “Terrible Ted” the
latest Bee Gees’ album. Rock’s loss could
be rock’s gain.

to the Top

“Hold On” is a song of freedom and
holds the key to the albums’ meaning.

“Music holds the secret
to know it can make you whole.

It’s not just a game and

0-1.it’s the music inside your soul.”

In contrast, the title track shows us the
other side. A dark chessboard of politics,
money and industry pulling the strings of
society, characterize the music and
words. Although a satire of American
life, it is just a game for Triumph.
No hype-these gamesmen are headed for
the top. As Levine boasts, “Triumph’s
got a lot to offer, and I feel certain that a
year from now we’ll be one of the biggest

“bands in the whole damn rock and roll
word!” They just might.

Grover Washington Jr. succeeds in Putting ‘Paradise’ on Vinyl

By DAVID E. STUBBS

Paradise
Grover Washington J r.
Electra Records ‘-

“Paradise," the latest album by
modern jazz woodwindist Grover Wash-

ington Jr., shows .what a new record
company can do for an act. All of
Washington’s past eight albums have
either been with CTI records (now
defunct) or Motown records, (which
simply can’t package jazz).

Washington is now on Electra records,

Frampton Shows .‘Where He Should
Be’ with LP of Questionable Quality

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Peter Frampton
Where I Should Be
A&M

A lot of things happened in the summer
of 1976, most notably the Nation's
Bicentennial and Gerald Ford/Jimmy
Carter’s respective Presidential nomina-
tions.

And then there was Peter Frampton, a
relatively unknown guitarist from humble
Pie and Frampton’s Camel, who released
a double live album titled “Frampton
Comes Alive.” -It became the
biggest-selling album of all time (later
surpassed by Fleetwood Mac’s “Rum-
ours” and the soundtrack from “Saturday
Night Fever”), and propelled him into
It also
helped to land him the role of Billy Shears
in the ﬁlm version of “Sgt. Pepper’s
Lonely Hearts Club Band "

The success fell apart soon however. ln
1977, Frampton released ‘‘I’m In You.”
Critics and fans alike blasted the LP,
calling it “blatantly commercial.” It

Still, most of the music world waited for

the release of the “Sgt. Pepper” ﬁlm for
him to vindicate himself.
v Thefilm “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band,” however received an
immediate slagging from the press.
F rampton came off as a lovesick little boy,
and his singing was poor at best.‘ Nearly
everyone dismissed Peter Frampton off
as a ﬂuke, a flash in the musical world.

A&M Records has just released a new
Frampton LP, “Where I Should Be,”
which Frampton claims is more of the

‘style of music he’s used to. He clearly

hopes to exonerate himself with this
record.

The packaging, being the stuff of
pre-teen dreams, is aimed at any
thirteen-or fourteen-year-olds he missed
with his previous release.

Though “Paradise” is in a similar
format as his past two albums, “Live at
the Bijou” and “Reed Seed," it contains

quite a bit more versatility and style.
Washington still plays with the Locksmith

band, which is a definite plus. Locksmith
is a tight six piece rhythm section and

violinist which give Grover just enough

room to ﬂy away in improvision.

It’s hard to pick favorites, but there are
certain tunes which will probably become
Grover Washington classics: “Paradise,”
“Tell Me About it Now,” The Answer in
Your Eyes” and “Feel it Comin.”
Anyone who is familiar with Grover
Washington Jr.’s work knows what he
can do with a well-written piece. All of

the tunes on this album are relatively
well-written pieces.

album as cut after cut takes you to
paradise. But, as with any record, there's
a complaint. Hearing Grover Washington
perform his tunes live and hearing them
on record are two separate experiences.

Live in concert Grover’s improvisation
absolutely takes off and you can feel the
energy rolling off of the stage. But, on
record his solos seem too concise and
systematic. Putting seven songs on a jazz
album can very easily_ give the performer

‘the problem of too much musical

information in too little space. This
problem of space and material is quite
evident when listening to “Paradise’s”
second side; “Asia’s Theme” is much
too short and “Feel it Comin” could have
used a /coupld more choruses.

Aside” from the overall conciseness of
this album, it still contains some excellent
material and should keep Grover
Washington fans happy. But, on the
other hand, he should find a way for his
albums not to sound so similar.

If Grover Washington, Jr. wouldii’t
have changed record companies, this
album may not have been produced so
quickly. Hopefully, Grover will continue
his style of commercial innovation, and
continue to keep everyone relatively
happy; ‘ . “ '

But the musicianship, boasts Steve
Cropper and Donald “Duck” Dunn, late
of Blues Brothers fame, in addition to the
well-known Tower of Power horn section‘
and longtime Frampton right hand Bob
Mayo on keyboards. - .

Frampton can still solo as well as he
used to, letting guitar licks fly as
effortlessly as most people would ﬂick off
an insect.

Frampton’s voice is still very shining
and unable to sustain a note. It just isn’t
gutsy enough for the rockers he performs
on this album. '

There is no hope for this album. It has
no power, no drive, and at timessounds
embarrassingly like “I’m In You.” The
only songs of any value are “We’ve Just
Begun,” with its catchy syncopation,

guitar solos and background vocals the 1

beautiful ballad “Take Me By The
Hand,” which is the only song, suited to
Frampton’s voice and “It’s a Sad Affair,”
which combines the best facets of the
above two songs.

Don’t waste your money here. It's a
pity to call Frampton’s success a ﬂuke,

but after a listen to this it isn’t hard to see"

where he should be.

Fans Find Grid Losses Tough to Accept”

By SAM SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

To most Pitt football fans, 1978
Never
mind the team’s 8-4 record or the
fourth consecutive bowl. These
days Panther fans are satisﬁed only
with perfection. Blue and gold
faithful believe every year should
be a repeat of 1976, of a national
championship, and of Tony Dorsett
and Matt Cavanaugh.

But because 1978 saw Dorsett
playing for the Dallas Cowboys,
and Cavanaugh standing on the
sidelines in Foxboro, Massachu-
setts, ,[’itt’s season brought more
than a stadium full of fans back to
reality.

The Panthers returned to the
scene of their Sugar Bowl triumph,
the Louisian Superdome to play the
Tulane Green Wave in the season
opener. Pitt won easily, 24-6, but
the victory was something less than
an artistic success. Because of
Pitt’s defense, the outcome was
never in doubt, but the offense
continuously stalled and sputtered.
Rick Trocano started at quarter-
back, put 13 points on the board,
then was replaced by Lindsay
Delaney.

The offense started moving, but
then Delaney was injured, and
Trocano returned to throw a third
quarter 37 yard touchdown pass to
Gordon Jones.

Pitt opened its home season the
following week against Temple, the
team‘ Pitt defeated 76-0 the
previous year.

But the Owls surprised everyone
but themselves by taking. a 6-3 lead
at the half. Then the Panthers’
running game asserted itself, with
Trocano gaining 118 yards on 23
carries and Pitt won 20-12, despite
the absence of a passing game;

The following week, defeat
seemed certain for the Panthers as
the North Carolina Tar Heels took a
16-13 lead with four minutes
remaining in the game. - '

But Trocano salvaged a disap-
pointing day and made himself the

highlighted by a 25-yard pass to

receptions by Jones, and the

Jacobs.

Pitt 20, North Carolina 16.

Pitt used its 32-15 defeat of
Boston College as a tuneup for its
next game, at South Bend versus
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.

Early in the fourth quarter, the
Pitt football season reached what
turned out to be its highest point of
the season. Trocano ‘had just
rushed for his second touchdown of
the day, and Pitt had a seemingly
comfortable 17-7 lead with 13
minutes left in the game.

The situation was perfect for ND.
quarterback Joe Montana. Playing
for the first and only time of his
career against Pitt, he pulled off
what he had done so many other
times-the seemingly impossible.
And before Irish fans could scream,
“Fire Dan Devine!” Montana had
thrown two touchdown passes, and
run for another score, Pitt was no
longer undefeated. Notre Dame,
26-17._

Following the stunning defeat,
the Panther defense returned to
town with thoughts of quarterback
sacks dancing in its collective
mind. And it was quite fortunate
thinking, because Pitt’s offense
was nowhere to be found in a 7-3
Homecoming defeat of Florida
State.

Twice, the Seminoles had the
ball inside Pitt’s 20-yard line in the
ﬁnal two minutes of play, and
twice, Pitt’s defense redeemed
itself for the tragedy at South
Bend, Indiana.

Thus the Panthers were 5-1, and
undefeated Navy was next on tap.
But it was Pitt on tap late in the
afternoon, and the ~ Middies won
21-11 as Pitt’s ground game totaled
minus 28 yards on 34 carries.

Pitt traveled to Syracuse, to meet
the 1-7 Orangemen, minus quarter-
back Bill Hurley. After three
quarters Jackie Sherrill’s Panther’s
trailed 17-7.

It was time for Rick Trocano to
pretend he was Joe Montana, and
the sophomore quarterback did a
passable imitation, "driving the
team downﬁeld and scoring from
ﬁve yards out.

Jacobs converted the two poin-
ter, and Pitt was down 17-15. The
defense hung tough, aided by a
Mike Balzer interception, and Pitt
was ready for the kill. Playing
conservatively, the Panthers

worked their way ‘into field goal
range. Kicker Mark Schubert
calmly booted a 28-yarder with 3:09
remaining to make Pitt an 18-17
winner.

The stage was set for Pitt’s most
impressive win of the season, a
52-7 thumping of injury-ruined
West Virginia at Pitt Stadium. Pitt
appeared to move the ball at will,
and halfback Rooster Jones had the

game everyone was waiting for, as '

he gained 169 yards on 18 carries,
including two touchdowns.
Trocano had his best day
throwing the ball, completing 13 of
17 passes for 146 yards. Larry Sims
also scored two touchdowns with
Russell Carter scoring the ﬁrst of
his collegiate career. 4
The following week, Pitt found
itself trailing Army, 7-0, and on the
verge of falling behind 14-0’ as
Army had the ball on Pitt’s
one-yard line. Pitt then received a
premature visit from Santa; as Jeff
Delaney grabbed Jimmy Hill’s
fumble out of the air and ran 99

yards for a touchdown.

Willie Collier caught‘ his first
scoring pass, a 31-yarder from
Trocano, and Pitt was well on its
way to a 35-17 victory and a bid to
the Tangerine Bowl. ‘

Not lmany people gave the
Panthers much of a chance against
undefeated and top ranked Penn
State at University Park the
following Friday. p

The game started on a positive
note for the Panthers as Jacobs ran
for 18 yards on the first play from
scrimmage. But that was to be
Pitt’s only first down of the

«quarter, while Mike Guman ran

three yards for a score to’ give the
Lions a 7-0 lead after one period.

Both defenses dug in and a
difficult wind made it tough for
Trocano and Chuck Fusina to
throw.

Pitt’s defense held the Lions to
123 yards on 62 rushes, but the
visitors only garnered 83 on 34

Women Spikers Tops in East, Impressive at AIA W's

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Coming off its best season ever,
the Pitt women’s volleyball team
will be looking to improve on last
season’s 13th place finish at
nationals. The Pantherettes lost
only one woman to graduation (Pat
Montgomery) from a team that
ﬁnished 41-12.

Returning for Pitt will be senior
Cindy Chambers, juniors Ingrid
Mueller and Maria Perez sopho-
more Paula Olsen, all starters last
season. Head coach Mike Hebert
called Olsen the best freshman in
the East-last season.

I Also returning will be Kathy
Sonricker, Andra Pletz, Marybeth
Niemitz and Nancy Zentner.

Pitt’s appearance at the national

tournament was their ﬁrst, and- the

Pantherettes didn’t lose a game in -

any of the matches in their ﬁght
for the Eastern regional title.

During the season, Pitt won the
Temple Invitational without losing
a game and placed ﬁfth at its own
invitational. An overconﬁdent
Pantherette team caused errors in a
game with Indiana (Pa.), leading to
a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish.

In other tournaments, Pitt was
second at the Delaware Invita-
tional, third at Maryland, and
second to Purdue at the Hoosier
Classic where Pitt was the only
Eastern team represented.

The Pantherettes were ﬁfth at
the Houston Invitational which was
the highest any Eastern team has
ever ‘finished at that tournament.

At nationals, Pitt gave a name
not only to itself, but to Eastern

volleyball in general, with its
thirteenth-place ﬁnish. In the
previous two years, the two

Eastern teams together won two
games (not matches) between
them, and Pitt and the other
Eastern representative Rutgers,
each won two matches and four
games.

“The East traditionally ﬁnishes
last at nationals,” said Hebert.
“We (Rutgers and Pitt) ﬁnished
above three of the nine regions in
the country, below three and tied
with two. We lifted the East out of
the cellar.”

Hebert said that recruiting went
well and Pitt will be playing with
the services of five talented

freshmen this season. Robin
Kuklais and Ellen Mangus, both of
Kiski Area High School, were both
ﬁrst team allstate selections two
years in a row.

In addition, Julie Gaul of
Washington High School, Shelly
Riemersmaof Penn Hills and Tina
Newton of Kenmore, N.Y. will add
to the Pantherette effort.

Hebert was criticized during the
year for scheduling Pitt to play in
the Hoosier Classic and Houston
tournament. His critics felt he
should not go out of his region as
much, and pad his record with easy
wins.

Those critics will be out in full
force again this season when they
see the schedule which includes a

1 West Coast tour with the Panther-

ettes competing at USC, Hawaii,
Hawaii-Hilo, Brigham Young-
Hawaii and San Diego State. Pitt
will also return to Houston.

During that West Coast tour, Pitt
will face the numbers two, three,
ﬁve and six teams at last year’s
nationals.

“No other team in the East has
anything comparable to our
schedule,” said Hebert. “We fully
intend to repeat as Eastern
champs.”

Pitt will again host the Pitt
Invitational, and a new tourn
ment, the Pitt Classic will begin
October 20. Pitt will host Ohio
State, Rutgers and Ottawa Univer-
sity. Also, Pitt will host the
Eastern Regional championships.

f 1‘ Saturday, “June 23,1979;Pi§e"I‘T‘_

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staffwriter

The ‘1978-79 Pitt basketball
Panthers suffered, but fortunately
survived, an identity crisis of sorts.
After breezing to an early season
record of 5-0, Pitt began losing
games ll’) just about every
conceivable manner and soon
found itself with an 8-9 record, with
the toughest part of the schedule
remaining.

On Jan. 22, Coach Tim Grgur-
ich’s team lost an overtime contest
Iona, 84-79. another one of those
games in which ‘it had appeared
there was no way the Panthers
could blow a sizeable lead in the
final minute.

With 51 seconds remaining, Pitt
had led Iona by seven points. The
loss was typical of those preceeding
it: many wondered if 1979 was to be
a repeat ofthe nightmarish 1976-77
season when the Panthers com-
piled a 6-2] record. v

As steadily as the Panthers had
worked themselves into losing
form, however, they began pulling
themselves out of it. First, Pitt
returned to the ranks of the
respectable with homecourt wins
over Mercyhurst and slowdown-
oriented Penn State. The
Panthers, led by Sam fBam’
Clancy.’s 23 points and 13 re-
bounds, plus 23 and 20 points by
forwards Terry Knight and Sammie
Ellis, respectively, then triumphed
over city rival Duquesne at the
Civic Arena. That 89-83 victory
was an exhibition of pressure ﬁeld
goal shooting by both teams and
perhaps the finest Pitt-Duquesne
game ever played.

By the time the team traveled to
Durham, North Carolina to face

‘ fourth-ranked Duke, Pitt was not

the team it had been several weeks
earlier. The team who felt sure of
losing to Iona now actually believed
it could upset 1978 NCAA ﬁnalist
Duke on the Blue Devils’ home
court, no less. '

The result: Pitt 71, Duke 69.

No longer merely respectable,
the Pantherswere now considered
a real threat to capture the Eastern
Eight title.

“The win over Duke has to be
considered one of the greatest
yictories in Pitt athletic history,”
said Grgurich. “No one, except us,
expected we would win. Now we’re
in control of the season and in

. control of our own destiny.

“It’s not a matter of us hoping
someone else loses, now we feel we
can go out and win it ourselves.”

- Pitt came close to winning the
regular season Eastern Eight

say, close only counts in horse-

From here it was on to the Civic

play Villanova, this time in a
semi-ﬁnal just two weeks following
the schools’ ﬁrst matchup.

On the eve of the tournament
seminﬁnals, Grgurich had said,
“We know what we did wrong

bit more than a week earlier, the
game was played up as a
confrontation between “Sam Bam”

game in Pitt'sburgh),'the Scarlet

Knights broke through the Pitt
press and earned a spot in the
NCAA tournament with a 61-57
triumph.

Over 50,000 fans paid to see the

proving 1979 to be the league’s
most successful tournament year
ever. The tournament was not all
rosy, however, as West Virginia
University coach Gale Catlett
threatened to remove his team
from the Eastern Eight following
the Mountaineers’ semi-ﬁnal loss
to Rutgers. .

Clancy was selected by the
coaches’ for the regular season

the writers. Several months later,
Clancy was picked for the United
States team in a tryout for the Pan
Am games, to be held next month.

At press time, the only new faces ~

expected on court next season are
6-0 guard John Ryan and 6-8 Paul
Brozovich. Ryan, a Wilkinsburg

described by assistant coach Cleve
Edwards as, “Not the kind of guy
you’d notice for spectacular plays,

done.” ‘

legheny High School, is one of the

tallest Panthers this season.

The Panthers will look for help
from 6-11 Ed Scheurmann.

Wallace.

Recruits to End   Gymnasts’ Woes?

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Lack of depth was the major
problem for the men's gymnastics
team last season, but shouldn’t be
a problem this year due to some
ﬁne recruiting, according to head
coach Frank D’Amico.

The Panthers (4-3) ended last
season ranked 35th in the country
and placed ninth at the Eastern
Regionals.

Three all-around gymnasts have
been recruited by D’Amico and he

calls them the three best gymnasts .

in Western Pennsylvania. Chris
Femiani of Peter Township was
sixth in the PIAA. His specialties
are the floor exercise and vault and
D’Amico calls him "an aggressive
performer with good potential.”
The other two recruits are Rick
Gazda and Jeff McBroom, both of
Ambridge. Gazda is a- talented

sidehorse performer and should
also do well in the ﬂoor exercise,
said D’Amico. “He has a lot of
form and style.

“These three will add a good
deal of needed depth to the team,
especially with Allen (Meyers)
out,” he said. g

Meyers is being red-shirted this
season for health reasons and will
be missed by the team. He was one
of last year's most consistent
performers, despite health prob-
lems.

Among the returning Panthers
are Bob Besong, Ken Lunz,
Femiani, Byron Johns and Dave
Rich. _

“We expect a lot from Bob
(Besong) who is working very hard
this summer," said D’Amico. “No
one will be able to beat him out for
our number. one ﬂoor man.

“Ken (Lunz) has a lot of class,

form and style,” he said. “Joe
(Femiani)'had a tough freshman

year and had to work really hard. ‘

He should show improvement next
year.

The Panther upset Navy last
season, setting a Pitt gymnastics
scoring record of 196.85 in the
process.

According to D’Amico, this year
will be the best year ever for
gymnastics at Pitt. I

“We’re going to scare a lot of
people like Ohio State did last
year," he said.

However, that will be tough
because the Panthers have beefed
up their schedule, adding Ohio
State and Southern Connecticut to
the line-up. Both were power-
houses last season.‘ Penn State,
Temple and Slippery Rock will also
provide stiff competition for Pitt.

The ‘

Pantherette Track Team Third in East, competes in AIAW 

1979 was by far the most
successful season yet for the
Pantherette track team. Unde-
feated in outdoor dual-meet
competition, Pitt qualified sixteen
athletes for the Eastern Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (EAIAW) championships.

After finishing ﬁfth out of 45
schools at the indoor champion-
ships, the Pantherettes achieved
their goal of a top-three team finish
outdoors. This championship, held
at Hartwick College in New York,
enabled several women to achieve
all-East honors.

By ﬁnishing third in the team
standings (and edging out de-
fending team champion Penn State

in -the process) out of 68 teams

represented, the tracksters became
the fourth Pitt women’s team to do
so this season in EAIAW champ-
ionships.

Leading the Pantherettes was
sprinter Gwen Murray and thrower
Peri Jude Radecic. Murray, who
set a new Pitt record of 53 seconds
ﬂat for the 440-yard dash, anchored
the 800-medley relay to a first-
place ﬁnish at Easterns ‘and
eighth-place at nationals. She was
also runner-up to the University of
District of Columbia's Liz Young in
the EAIAW 400 meters; Murray
was ninth in this event at the
national championships.

Radecic broke school records in
the shot and discus and placed in
both at the EAIAW meet. She had

qualiﬁed for the national meet in
January with a shot put throw of
over 48 feet.

High jumper Karen Krichko was
a big story in 1979. As a high
schooler, Krichko had won the
state championship two years in a
row, with Pantherette Marie Ribik
ﬁnishing second both times.

In college, however, it was Ribik
who had set the Pitt record of 5-8,
but Krichko came back with
consistent jumps over 5-9 as a
senior and was a third-place
ﬁnisher at Easterns both indoors
and outdoors behind Maryland’s
nationally-ranked Paula Girven and
Jalene Chase. Ribik was fourth at
both meets.

Hurdler Leslie Palmer was
second at Easterns and teamed
with Linda Mitchell, Murray and
Cissy Wilborn on both the medley
and 400-meter relays which comp-
eted at nationals.

Javelin thrower Carmen Scherich
was also a qualifyer for the AIAW
national meet. '

Team records fell in abundance
with Murray now holding several
individual records and four relay
marks. Besides the new records in
the 880-yard, medley and 400-
meter relays, Jane Strause, Brenda
Chorpenning, Maria Sciullo and
Karen Bradley established two-
mile relay marks indoors and

outdoors; Strause also set a new
record in the open half mile.

Only three seniors are lost to
graduation, but with rapid im-
provement on the part of other
schools and a limited number of
competitors on the squad this
season, the Pantherettes may be
hard-pressed to repeat its team
successes. Pitt will not Compete in
dual- or tri-meet competition this
season; instead, the team will opt
for the bigger meets such as thtfw,
Penn Relays, the Maryland In-I
vitational, Dogwood Relays.and of
course, its own indoor invitational.
The Pantherettes will also host the
1980 Eastern outdoor champion-
ships at Pitt Stadium in May.

Pantherette Tankers Make Splash on National Swim Scene

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Five Pantherette swimmers
achieved All-America status at the
Association of _ Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women (AIAW) cham-
pionships hosted by Pitt last
March.

Kathy Stetler, Amy Jackson,
Suzanne Pulley, Linda Franken-
bach and Julie Terrell all placed in
the top eight in at least one event,
during the Pantherette’s fine
performance which placed them
12th in the country.

Jackson, Pulley, Frankenbach
and Terrell will be among the
returnees for the Pantherettes
(10-1) along with Nancy Henry,
Judy Klotz, Sandy Taylor and
divers Hillary McBride and Holly
Sluss. They all competed in the‘
national championship meet last
season.

Stetler has graduated after
achieving All-America status four
years in a_row. She was only the
second four-time All-America at
.Pitt. The only other athlete to gain
ihat honor was Tony Dorsett.

Bemis’ Booters to

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pm News Staff Writer
As a song proclaimed to its

. listeners in the summer past, it’s

best to “roll with the changes.”
These words may well develop- into
the motto for the Pitt soccer team
when its 1979 season open in
September. Changes have been
occurring in great abundance for
the Panther booters since the
conclusion of their 6-8-1 season of a
year ago.

Everything from a budget
shortage, to graduation, to two
members of the team signing
professional contracts before the
end of their college_ careers, will
make for a most unusual return for
the Panthers.

The 1979 season will reveal a
very young, yet experienced team
taking the turf under the direction
of veteran head coach Leo Bemis.
The majority» of the Panthers
playing in September will be
underclassmen.

Returning upperclassmen will be
Stevie Harrison, Tom Liebenguth,
and Jeff Tissue. Harrison will
return to the midfield where he saw
limited action due to a depth of
quality midﬁelders the Panthers
enjoyed last‘ season. Liebenguth,
who was used as a stopper last
season at center fullback, will be

moved back into the sweeper-back
position. The sweeper, who is the
last line of defense between the
opposition and the defending
goalkeeper, will be a position
where Liebenguth can display his
hard-nosed defensive tactics.
“Tom was used consistently in
our backﬁeld last year due to his
strong, aggressive playing” said
Bemis. “What we need to do is to
ﬁnd a good stopper and we will
move Tom back to sweeper.”
The Panthers may very well have
found that stopper in an incoming
freshman, Karl Heimbach, from
Reading’s Wilson High School.
Heimbach is considered by many
as the defensive player to beat on
the ﬁeld. With the combination of
Heimbach and Liebenguth for the
‘defense, the Panthers should prove
to be very successful at stopping
the goal." Rounding out the
defenders will be Tom Kunkel, a
returning junior who saw much
play last season as a right fullback.
In addition to Kunkel will be junior
Danny Hamm. Hamm will be used
as either the final defender, or as
part of the Panthers needed-to-be-
ﬁlled midﬁeld.

Recruiting will bring to Pitt two
top notch players from Europe.
Robert Kokolis fromNaples, Italy

tancing second-place Rutgers
which had.342.

First year Pantherette head
coach Dick Bradshaw was pleased
with Pitt’s performance at the
national championships although
the Pantherettes didn’t ﬁnish in the
top ten, their goal.

“Sometimes when you host a
national championship, your team
suffers,” he said. “I was glad»-that
it didn’t happen to us.”

Ten Pantherettes qualified for
the nationals, ﬁve made All-
America. «

“When a team does that well,”

said Bradshaw, “you’ve just got to
be happy."

A national championship meet...
in any sport, is exciting experience I

for any athlete, and the “Swimmin
Women” were no exception.

Pitt freshman Terrell said, “It
didn’t hit me until we arrived at the
pool the first day -and saw all the
other girls from across the country.
Iwas super-excited. I thought, ‘Oh
my gosh...’ and it really got me
psyched.”

Pitt _was praised by coaches,
competitors and fans for the quality
of the organization of the meet.

In her opening of the final night
of the’competition, Texas’ Donna
Lopiano, AIAW commissioner for
large college national champion-gr
ships said, “I’d like to thank the
University of Pittsburgh for holding-
the finest AIAW swimming cham-

' pionships that we’ve ever had.”

The work that was involved in
organizing the meet and keeping it
running smoothly was reﬂected in
Bradshaw’s response when asked if
he’d agree to host the event again.
“Maybe in about 10 years.”

Next year’s championships won’t
be held at Pitt, but with nine of the
10 Pantherettes who qualiﬁed for
nationals returning, Bradshaw’s
team should improve upon last
year’s ﬁnish. "

Volleyball Team Nets First-year Experience to

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The winter of 1979 brought the
addition of mens volleyball to Pitt
under the direction of head coach
Mike Hebert. He is recognized for
his success at Pitt as he led his
women’s team to a 13th-place
ﬁnish in the nationals of last
season. Getting to the top of
Eastern volleyball is something
Hebert and his Panthers have as a
common goal for the upcoming
season.

Last winter was considered to be
a learning‘ year for many of the
Panthers due to the inexperience of
most of the‘ team. Leading the
Panthers and picked as the seasons
Most Valuable Player was junior
setter Jeff Beavers. He and the
remaining Panthers will return this

at just about any point on the ﬁeld.
Hadergy is a veteran of Irish rugby.

Moving to the all-important front
line the Panthers have one
returning senior, Jeff Tissue.
A transfer from nearby Edinboro
State College, Tissue played ‘his
ﬁrst season with the Panthers last

graduating captain Scott Hoffman.

Losing only Hoffman from his
lineup and the recruiting of some
top-notch players has Hebert
looking forward to next season with
much enthusiasm.

“Last season was a learning
experience for everyone involved,”

said Hebert. “The entire team had‘

to learn the basic educational
patterns surrounding the game of
volleyball. We will use this initial
season as a springboard into
something with more ﬁnesse for
next year.”

Hebert was not about to schedule
his ﬁrst—year squad against easy
opponents. Instead, Hebert placed
his team into the Eastern Con-
ference Volleyball League which is
considered to be the toughest
league, in irhe, . Em .  .B<?sis1.es

year. A very good assist—man
Tissue should prove to be the core
of Pitt’s front line. Also coming
back from last year will be junior
wings Jerry Buirge and Barry
Stein. Both saw a good deal of
playing time last season, and will
return with an essential year-of
experience under their belts.

Rutgers and Penn State (who
ﬁnished number one and two in the
East) the Panthers experienced the
toughest schedule of any team in
the league.

“To do anything complicated like
starting a new sport, we had to go
through a tough schedule to give
the team the best competition
available.” said Hebert, “which is
just what we did. At times we
played like a first-year, inex-
perienced team,” he added, “then
at other times the team looked just
great.”

Top returnees for the Panthers in
addition to the MVP Beavers will
be sophomore Arnie Matthews.

Matthews is considered by Hebert ,,

to be a very skilled and gifted

Tankers Undefeated--Again

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pin News Staff Writer

The Panther swimming team
continues to look unbeatable in the
East after two straight years of dual
meet wins (20 meets) and four
straight Eastern titles.

Despite these impressive sta-
tistics, the Panthers were slightly
disappointed ‘on more than one
occasion last season.

At the Eastern championships,
the Panthers, who scored 479
points, 159 more than second-place
West Virginia, were disappointed
that more of their swimmers did
not qualify for the NCAA champ-
ionships. Only six swimmers and
two divers did qualify.

Hoping to finish in the top 20 at
nationals, the team was disap-
pointed with their 26th-place
ﬁnish. The best performance was
turned in by Stu Swanson in the
200-yard backstroke. He placed

10th and gained All-America,

status, making him the first
All-America swimmer at
Diver Pat Greenwell was 13th in
three-meter diving.

During their second consecutive
undefeated season, the Panthers
defeated North Carolina, West

Virginia and Cincinnati. Pitt’s
contest with Cincinnati was the

year's closest’ meet, with a score of

58-55. Pitt also beat Maryland to
gain their first win at College Park

A since 1959.

The Panthers scored a record 340

' points in winning the Penn State

Invitational Relay Championships.
At that meet, ﬁrst-year head coach
Fred Lewis let the team choose the
starting lineup. After receiving
several ideas, Lewis decided on Stu
Swanson’s lineup.

“My lineup would have been a

T lot more conservative than Stu’s,”

said Lewis. “We probably

wouldn’t have won if we had used ‘

mine. Stu's lineup gave us a

chance.”

Among this year's returnees,
along with Swanson and Greenwell
will be Jeff Trew, Greg Pelton,
Scott_ Winkler, Mickey Termin,
Chris Butts, Rick Carter, Dale
Pflaumer, and Mike Connor. Each
of those Panthers competed in the
NCAA’s last year.

Ten wins in a row for two straight
years is a great accomplishment,
and with the depth and talent they
possess, the Panther swimmers
should go undefeated again. They
will be the favorites to cop the
Eastern crown for the ﬁfth straight
year, and could improve on their
ﬁnish at nationals. The swimmers

are one athletic team at Pitt that
isn’t all wet.

A Freshman ’s Guide to Panther Sports and Recreation

The last thing a freshman, wants upon entering
college is to behave in such a manner that everybody
else can spot he's a freshman from 200 yards away.
It is with this in mind the Pitt News presents “A
Freshman’s Guide to Panther Sports and
Recreation.” (or “Sometimes Useful Trivia To Be
Used in an Offhand Manner in Order to Convince
Others You Have Some Idea as to What's Going On
Around Here_and Who's Tim Sherrill and Jackie
Grgurich, Anyway?)

HOME FOOTBALL GAMES: If your high school
played afternoon games, feel right at home. If not,
the Friday nights hanging out at the stadium are
over. The Panthers play five Saturday afternoon
home games this season, and while this schedule
(which includes the likes of Navy, Syracuse and Kan-
sas) does not promise to be the most exciting in Pitt
history, be patient. And anyway, isn’t it better than
playing Can_on Macmillen?

HALFTIMESHOWS: You won’t be seeing a drill
team, pom-pom girls, etc. The Pitt Band is accom-
panied by the Golden Girls, a majorette crew which
uses a lot of modern dance movement. Do however,
get used to seeing male cheerleaders, as just about

‘ every college has them.

JACKIE SHERRILL: Head football coach.
Speaks with a Southern drawl, as did the previous
coach. Take heart in that Sherrill’s team should do
better this season than last (even though an 8-4
record is nothing to sneeze at, you’ll finda lot of
spoiled fans around Pittsburgh).

SCHENLEY PARK: Nice place for jogging,
frisbee, football, tennis and other recreational
pastimes. It used to be home course of Pitt’s cross-

On the Run

country team, but due to budget squeezes, only one
or two meets may be held there. Beware Killer Hill
(located on first of six-mile cross-country course.)

TREES HALL: Interesting place where one can
swim, play racquetball/or visit the training room to
watch ankle taping. Weight rooms and universal
gyms are available to both males and females.

TREES POOL: Site of many Pitt swimming vic-
tories over the past few years. Both the men's and
women’s teams won their regional championships
last season. Once upon a time, the Panthers fielded a
superb water polo team, also.

NCAA AND AIAW (National Collegiate
Athletic Association and Association of Intercol-
legiate Athletics for Womens governing bodies
for college sports. If someone tells you _“I went to
NCAA’s AIAW’s last year”, be impressed.
Qualifying standards are tough. If they tell you they
placed at NCAA‘s/AIAW’s, be even more im-

. pressed. -

HOME BASKETBALL GAMES: The other great
social event in Panther sports. Don't let the ap-
pearance fool you, Fitzgerald Field House is used as
the home court for Pitt games, not for storing air-
planes or holding barn dances. This season’s home
schedule is exceptional, including Duke, Iona and
Villanova. You may get dressed up for these games,
but keep in mind it’s mighty stuffy in the Field House

when crowded.‘ Promotions have included free Big
Macs for Panther fans when the team wins.
TIGER PAUL: Mr. Auslander, known as Tiger,

has been an unofficial cheerleader for the Pitt
basketball team for many years. Usually attired with
navy blue sweater and white sneakers, Tiger has been
successful in arousing the vocal support of the most
deadbeat crowds.

TIM GRGURICH; Head basketball ' coach.
Rarely actually sits on the bench during games, he is
an emotional coach. He played basketball at Pitt in
the 60's. As Panther coach, Grgurich has had the
bad luck of losing at least one starting player each
season to injuries and pro contracts, sinceﬁhe took
over -in 1975. If anyone ever mentions'Mel Bennett,
Keith Starr, Mike Rice, Sonny Lewis etc., shake your
head and muse, “What a team that could have

been.” Even if’ you have never heard of them, it

might make you appear knowledgable.

SAM CLANCY: At 6-6, Clancy led the Eastern
Athletic Association in rebounding last basketball
season. An Olympic hopeful, he is practically in-
destructible on the court. Not nicknamed “Sam
Bam” for nothing. It is wise to be nice to Sam. ‘

PITT STADIUM: In springtime, a good place to
throw Frisbees or get a tan (before or after football
practice, of course). Site of two large track meets
this year, the Pitt Invitational and the Eastern AIAW
championships, both in May.

THE PITT NEWS SPORTS PAGES: To be
ignored completely; After all, what do a bunch of
students know, anyway? If you’ve read all the way

to the bottom of this column, you’ve learned that
already.

  Wrestling Team Grapples With Recruiting Problem 

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

If Pitt assistant head wrestling
coach Rande Stottlemyer could only
have lifted the entire campus up
and moved it to the country, the
1979 recruiting season could have
been successful. t

But as it stands, Pitt is located in
the city, and so top Pennsylvania
recruit Eric Childs (142 pounds), a
country boy from the central part of
the state opted to attendorival Penn
state in the rural Happy Valley
where he feels more at home.

‘‘It can be difficult recruiting in
the city,” Stottlemyer said. “The
country boys don’t want to leave
the country. ’ ’

So what about the city boys?
Pittsburgh boasts some strong
wrestling schools.

“The city kids want to get away
from the city life,” Stottlemyer
sighed. “So they pick country
campuses, too.”

Pitt Baseball Team Finishes 14-6

By KAREN KADILAK

Pin News Staff Writer

\e'é

re

innnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

Pitt’s baseball team finished its
season with a 14-6 record.

Panther coach Bob Lewis,
encouraged with his team’s record,
already looks forward to next
season and the start of fall practice.

“I think we have improved since
last year,” Lewis said, noting last
season's 11-17-1 record. “Our
sophomores played much better
than they did as freshmen.

“But we haven't peaked yet,”
the Panther coach said. “We have
a young team. We only lose three
people. (Pitchers Marr:_ Bianco,

Dave Crist, and Tony DiSaia are all
seniors).”

Returning next season will be
catcher Jim Pastin, first baseman
Chuck Mesiano, second baseman
Duane Sakanich, shortstop Marc
Massa, third baseman Chris
Mihalik, left fielder Rich Kline,
center fielder Mark Stevens ‘and
right ﬁelder Tony Roporti. '

Mesiano, Sakanich, Stevens and
Roperti are juniors, while Pastin,
Massa, Mihalik and Kline are
sophomores.

Pitchers Jim Boyle, Don Koller,
Mike Luciow, Tim Moran, Allen
Lachowicz and Larry Lamonde will

also return next season. .

According to Lewis, Pitt will
work on “fundamentals” during
fall practice.

“Fall practice is good in that is
allows us to concentrate on our
fundamentals,” the Panther coach
said. “The more you practice, the
better you are.” Repitition makes
things automatic and mistakes are
minimized.

“Our fundamentals were good
last season, but we want continued
improvement,” Lewis said. “We
only missed two signals this
season. We were very alert on both
our pic}:-.;ff and relay plays.’-’

Olympic Hockey Hopefuls L
Lead Panther lee Club

The Pitt Hockey Club’s 1979 season was highlighted by
tryouts for the Olympic trials offered to Panthers Curt Hetz,
Vern Shaver and Larry Newell.

Newell made it the farthest, finishing among the final eight
goalies. Center Hetz and defenseman Shaver made the final
Detroit tryout camp cut, but were not chosen to play on the
team which would compete at the Olympic tryout in Denver.

All three were seniors.

The club finished second in its own annual Candlelight
Tournament, losing to Bowling Green in the finals. The
tournament was dedicated to former Pitt coach Lenny
Baracalow who, died of cancer in April of 1978.

  Doubters Underestimated Panther Opponents, Situations

The 1979 football season will be interesting for
many reasons, not the least of which is Jackie
Sherrill’s bid to make Pitt students and alumni forget
about Johnny Majors and his “Pride and En-
thusiasm” sermons. ‘

Sherrill has been the recipient of criticism from
fans who are unhappy despite his three-year record
of 17-6-1 as the Panther’s head coach. The critics
point to the losses to Notre Dame, the tie at Florida,
two losses to arch rival Penn State and the disaster at
last year’s Tangerine Bowl. Pitt fanatics seem com-
pelled to place the burden of blame on Sherrill, but
is such action justified?

. When Sherrill took the Pitt job three years ago,
f0“0Wil1g Pitt’s 12-0, number one season of 1976
most fans were hungry for more of the same. 9

‘In 1977, all went well for one quarter against Notre
Dame, until Matt Cavanaugh broke his wrist while
completing a touchdown pass to Gordon Jones.

Enter Wayne Adams. Exit Wayne Adams. His
replacement, Tom Yewcic, one of 1976’s heroes,
failed in his attempt to salvage an upset of the Irish.
And enter Mr. and Mrs. Criticism and their son,
Second Guésser. ’

Sports Scene

By Sam Sciullo

 

Perhaps now, two years later, people can analyze
that situation with a more sensible perspective. In all
probability, all the preparation in the world couldn’t
have compensated for the loss of Cavanaugh. Pitt
simply wasn’t capable of beating Notre Dame
without Matt Cavanaugh. Because there wasn’t a
more talented replacement was probably more
Majors’ fault ‘thamSherrill’s, because Pitt failed to
recruit. a quality signal caller after Majors’ second

year. The present Tennessee coach even shied. away.

from Chuck Fusina when the youth was a local
scholastic star at Sto-Rox. '

Then there was the great snowball battle versus I

Penn State in the 1977 season finale at Pitt Stadium.
Before the game, most Pitt" students and fans were of

the opinion that the game wouldn’t even beclose,

that the Panthers would blow out the Lions. But the
Penn State football team is similar to a rattlesnake.
Although it is not very well liked, it should be treated

,with a great deal of respect. And because most Pitts-

burghers were not of that opinion, the loss was dif-
ficult to accept. So why not blame the coach?

Again, the belly aching wasn’t justified, because
the Nittany Lions were, by no means, a slouch team.
And Pitt’s other conquerer,’ Notre Dame, went on to
win the national championship by destroying Texas
inthe Cotton Bowl.

Last season’s 8-4 record was less than had been ex-
pected, but, to use an overused cliche, Pitt was a
relatively young team, comprised mainly of
sophomores. But those sophomores are now juniors,
plus Sherrill has assembled a wiser and more mature
group of assistant coaches than those he had last
year.

And with the addition of a big fullback, a couple
of potentially brilliant freshmen at the “skilled
positions,” and an extra year under his belt, Jackie
Sherrill appears ready to show football fans why
Johnny Majorsmade him his right-hand man for so
many years. -

Sanft’s team was ninth in the
nation last year, being the only Pitt
athletic team to ﬁnish in the top ten
nationally.

‘After ﬁnishing the dual meet
season with a 6-3 record and

placing third at regionals, it was V,

touch and go as to whether or not
the Pantherettes would receive a
bid to the national championships.

Pitt qualified 15th out of 16
teams with a seasonal average of
133.016 points. A score of 133.85
at nationals was good enough for
ninth place, and Pitt just missed
catching eighth-place Louisville
who had 133.9 points.

“Going to ‘nationals was a

fantastic experience for us and the
competition will be invaluable to
the team,” said Sanft. “People
were saying ‘Who is this team?’
We will be watched this year.”
During the dual meet season,
Pitt’s victories included wins over
Maryland, Temple, William and
Mary and Slippery Rock. Their
three losses came at the hands of
Penn State (second at nationals
Clarion (third) and Michigan State.
The ‘Pantherettes scored their
season high score of 134.6 against

will be seniors Alison Hoburg and

ln addition, Sanft has recruited
one incoming freshman, Babvie
Flock from Belle Vernon. Flock is a
strong all-around performer,
according to Sanft, with a high
difficulty factor in her routines.

“Her strongest aspect is that she
is such a dynamic performer,” said
Sanft. *“She is. a super tumbler and

does some great aerial movements

on the (balance) beam.”

Sanft said that in collegiate
athletics, a coach always expect
improvement as an athlete gains
experience. She added however,
that this is not the case in
gymnastics where a performer is
usually best at age 15 or 16 and
then drops off.

“This is not true with our team, ”
Sanft said. “Our girls expect to
improve with more work and I
expect it of them.”

Tracksters Come Up With Youthful Winners in '79

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Having lot its top jumper and two
best distance runners to gradua-
tion, in 1978, la-st season’s Panther
track team turned to the youth of its
program and came up with a few
winners.

Freshman Larry Kinney was the
big name for the jumpers this past
season. After breaking the Pitt
indoor triple jump record with a
second-place finish in January's
Pitt Invitational, Kinney went on to
establish a new outdoor record as
well. His jump of 52-3‘/2 was not
only good enough to capture the
outdoor Central Collegiate Champ-
ionship at Notre Dame, but

qualiﬁed him for the NCAA
championships at Champaign, III.

A 48-foot jumper in high school,
where he was Pennsylvania state
champ in 1978, Kinney’s rapid
improvement enabled him to win
the‘ college division of the
presitgious Penn Relays, the
outdoor Pitt Invitational, and
several other meets.

The Panther runners were paced
by distance runner Gary Siriano.
Siriano had missed qualifying for
the NCAA cross-country champion-
ships in November by one place at
the Lehigh qualifying meet, but
made up for it with his running on
the track.

Invitational mile, Siriano switched
to the 5000 meters outdoors, where
he placed first in the college
division of the Penn Relays and was
a second-place finisher in this
event at the outdoor Pitt Invita-
tional, Virginia Relays and Central
Collegiate championships. His
best time for the distance is 14:18.

Pitt had a measure of success
with its relays; the two-mile relay
of Greg Conover, Joel Albers,
Darren Geary and Bill Me Shea
were top-six finishers in several
meets and participated in Penn
Relays.

The Panther mile relay of Bud
Cooper, Larry Shippen, Dwayne

DeFoor and Keith Leckenby with a
best time of 3:14.5, also competed
at Penn and the Tennessee
Dogwood Relays; all but Leckenby
return this season. Runners-up at
the Pitt Invitational and at Central
Collegiates was the 440-relay of
Shippen, DeFoor, Buddy Morris
and .Leckenby. —

DeFoor, Albers and Geary were
exceptional as freshmen. DeFoor
ran consistently in the 47-second
range in his relay splits, while
Geary, Maryland state champ in
The 880, was leadoff man for his
relay. He aIso'placed in,the open
1000 meters at the indoor Pitt
Invitational.

1

Albers came back after missing
the indoor. track season with a
sub-1:52 time in the open half mile.
As a high school senior, he was one
of the nation’s top schoolboy
half-milers.

Gene Roach, Pitt pole-vault
record holder, was hampered with
back injuriers. Nonetheless, he
had a fine season winning the
Colonial relays clearing 15-3.

Among coach Mike Agostinella’s
recruits this season is Terry
Gallagher, a middle distance man
from Philadelphia. Gallagher has
run a 1:S2.8 relay split and also
competes in the quarter-mile.
