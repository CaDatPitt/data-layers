Student Association Commis-
sioners Wade Lawson and Len-
ny Klavonic have announced a
unanimous decision of the Social
Commission to raise the student
activity fee from 8 to 12 dollars
in order to expand programs and
services.

The decision coincides with a
move to render financial compen-
sation to all active members of
the Student Association.

The commissioners stated that
the main purpose of the activi-
ties fee hike is to provide better
services for students.

Additional funds will provide
increased social activities such
as first run films and 20 to 25
thousand dollar musical groups.

The commissioners also hope
to improve services in areas such
as medical funds. bail bond. and
free lawyers.

In addition. they_wish to give

greater financial support to stu-
dent organizations.

Inflation was cited as one jus-
tification for the raise and high-
er activity fees at other univer-
sities was another.

The commissioners feel that
financial compensation for Stu-
dent Association members will
improve the organization.

“Discrimination” Scored

Klavonic argued that the pre-
sent system of student organiza-
tions discriminates against people
of low income status.

Many students. he said. must
limit their participation in stu-
dent organizations due to the
necessity of part time employ-
ment.

Monetary aid would eliminate
this “discrimination" and make
participation in the Student As-
sociationavailable to all.

All heads of active committees
would receive merit assistance
under this plan.

The commissioners would per-
haps be paid a fixed amount per
month. Other members would
meet monthly to evaluate them-
selves and receive pay accord-
ing to the degree of their per-
formance.

P1ansFee‘lHike  

Check Needed?

Questions were raised con-
cerning an effective check on the
Student Association under these
circumstances.

The Pitt News, which already
employs a system -of financial
compensation. is under the regu-
lation of an executive board com-
posed of the Director of Stu-
dent Publications and represen-
tatives of campus organizations.

The Student Association has
no such supervising body.

Klavonic feels that the hon-
esty of Student Association mem-
bers makes such a restraining
body unnecessary.

He stated that all pertinent
information would be made pub-
lie and that his constituency
would serve as an effective
check.

"We are elected by the stu-
dents. If we don‘t perform for
the students we should be taken
out by them." Klavonic stated.

 

 

Lawson Expects Hike

Commissioner Lawson express- ‘R

This summer. the Student As-

Wade Lawson. Committees
Commissioner. explained the op-
eration of the legal advice sys-
tem.

“Student government now has
two law firms on retainer which
will be available, at no cost, to
any Pitt student,” said Lawson.
“The attorneys of the firms
will deal with drug arrests, lease

and consumer problems, and
other legal matters that .students

encou_nter.” ’ V . _ ‘T

SA is also establishing a bail
bond fund and securing bond
rates with a particular County
bondsman. Lawson said that stu-
dents who wish to use the bail
bond fund shouldconfer only
with the bondsman associated
with SA.

"The rates we have gotten are
the cheapest in the city." explain-
ed Lawson. He assured that ball
money is guaranteed any Pitt
student who requests it. Students
who use the bail bond fund will
have 90 days to repay the loan.
so that the fund will always be
available.

SA is also negotiating for dis-
count rates for court proceedings
costs for which students would
have to pay.

To contact SA for legal advice,
students should call extension
7330 or 7328. To secure bail
bond services, an arrested stu-

dent should call 461-4544 or
687-7528.
By July 1. Lawson and his

fellow Commissioners hope to
be able to fund the bail bond
program and the medical
loan pool with student activity
fees. Law’son hopes to win an
emergency allocation to under-
write expenses for the bail bond
fund until that time.

With a $200 maximum allot-
ment. the medical fund will
help students pay extensive medi-
cal bills not covered by Univer-
sity Insurance.

To borrow from the fund, a

Pitt Unveils Forbes Plan; LRDCQ’;-ii
Commuter Lot Also Projected 

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

The University formally dis-
closed plans for its Forbes Com-
plex Phase I Wednesday night
at a meeting with representatives
of the Oakland community and
the city.

At the meeting. Director of the
Physical Plant Division Hunt
‘Martin also revealed University
plans for a new home for the
Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center <LRDC> and a com-
muter parking lot on the site of
the old Trees Field.

Though all three proposals
meet with objections from com-
munity representatives. the Forb-
es I project was the most liber-
ally criticized.

Building Complex
According to Martin, the
Forbes I project will include

a building complex housing the
School of Education, various
Social Science departments, and

an adjoining but separate wing 

for the School of Law.

The proposed six-story build-
ing complex. if built. will
surrounded by an open plaza
accessible from Oakland Ave.
Forbes Ave.. South Bouquet St..
Sonnott St.. and the Schenley
Plaza.

Underground parking space
for 550 cars is blueprinted for
the complex. along with an un-
derground chilled water plant
that could serve other parts of
the University as well as the
new complex.

The structure. according to
design. will be connected to the
Litchfield Towers by a _ loot-
bridge.

Martin said that the bulk of
the property needed to begin the
Forbes I development has been,
acquiredby the’.General State

Authority (GSA), which is financ-

 

ing the construction. Martin
said that a construction firm
could be contracted by the end
of this year or the beginning
of 1972.

Spokesmen for the Oakland
community. including represen-
tatives of People's Oakland. the
Model Cities program. and the
South Oakland Community Cen-
ter. voiced the fear that the pro-
posed complex would further con-
gest traffic on Forbes and Oak-

‘land Aves.

They also noted that the rath-
er drastic change in, the physi-
cal make-up of one side of Oak-

land Ave. caused by the new
structure could ha“e damaging
psychological effects on resi-

 

vol. 65, no.  

"If Phase I is built as now
planned.“ said Houston, “P_h‘ase_ --
11. Phase III, and Phase IV will’
follow. and the IV construction
will not in any sense give ac-. 
cess to the community." {

 

According to long-range, Uni- .. 
versity plans. Phases II and III .
of the Forbes Complex call for .
additional construction in the
Forbes Field area. Phase IV ten- !~ ’ .‘
tatively plans a city-community-'V ‘
University cultural center. i

 

Martin said that effects of the "_V I
proposed complex on traffic had, 7 ,,.f;_“
been studied and would be giv-
en further’ attention. However,~ 
Martin said Houston’s fear was " “ 7 -
unfounded, labelling his predic- .
tion of future construction_ a g. '

In addition, Pitt professor Dr.

struction of Forbes Phase I in
the manner presented would pre-
clude community input in the
erection of Phases II-IV of the
Forbes Complex.’

Famous U.S. Women Ski Team Diet

’During the non-snow off season
the U.S. Women’s Alpine Ski Team
members go on the “Ski Team" diet
-to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
That's right ~ 20 pounds in 14 days!
The basis of the diet is chemical food
action and was devised by a famous
"Colorado physician especially for the
U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy is

. maintained (very important!) while

reducing. You keep “full” — no
starvation - because the diet is de-
signed that way! lt’s a diet that is
easy to follow whether you work,
travel or stay at home.

This is, honestly, a fantastically

K successful diet. If it weren’t, the U.S.
Women’s Ski Team wouldn’t be per-
mitted to use it! Right? So, give
yourself the same break the U.S. Ski
Team gets. Lose weight the scientiﬁc,
proven way. Even if you’ve tried all
the other diets, you owe it to your-
self to try the US Women’s Ski

LRDC and Commuter Lot

Martin said that University
plans for the LRDC were more
mature. and that construction of
the building was "imminent.“
The University asked the City
Friday morning for permission
to construct the Center. A

The Center is to be located off
O’Hara St. near Allen Hall and
the O'Hara Garage. The LRDC
develops teaching methods and
aids, primarily for grade school,
and experiments with them in
model classrooms.

It is currently housed in sev-
eral University buildings.

The old Trees Field behind
Pitt Stadium. said Martin. will
be paved, lighted. attended. and
ready for student parking by
September. Cost of parking in
the lot will be $.40 daily.

Martin said that the Univer-
sity would seek improvement in
the campus bus service to facili-
tate transportation to and from
the parking lot. The lot will also
be available to night students.

Plans for the lot followed ses-
sions with Tom Gainan and other
Commuter Association members.

May 14 Deadline

The next meeting among rep-
resentatives of the three groups
is scheduled for May 12. By
May 14, community spokesmen
must submit an alternate plan
for development of the Forbes
Field area.

Earlier,
agreedgto postpone its Hillside
Dorms project indefinitely and
demolition of Forbes Field for
30 days so that members of the
community might have some
voice in construction plans.

A community plan calling for
a combination of classrooms.
open space. and commercial
areas in the Forbes Field area
was rejected last month by the
University because it planned in-
sufficient classroom space and
had no apparent source of funds.
The GSA would not fund such a
project. i

Lawson said that though SA
would like to initiate‘ a free
baby—sitting service. he is un-
certain of its feasibility. The
program would provide person-
nel. food. and recreation for
children and would also be sub-
sidized by student activities fees.

Claim Discrimination

  Feminist Groups Protest

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Approximately 45-50 women
marched in front of the Cathedral
of Learning April 7 between the
hours of 11 am. and I p.ni. to pro-
test the treatment of several l'ni-
versit_v employees who are active
members of the I7niversit_v Com-
mittee for Women's Rights

Il'(,.‘WR I.

DAVE POWERS
Spokesman for the Chancellor
. News Photo

The women cliam seven women
have been fired or forced to re-
sign while three others are being
harrassed as a direct result of
their affiliation with the feminist
group.

WOMEN PROTEST
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
The demonstrators were pro-

testing in behalf of JoAnn Gard-
ner of the PsychoIog_v Depart-
ment; Ina Braden and Ottie An-
drius of the Dental School: Lynn
Best. secretary; Nancy Van Buur-
en of the Provost‘s Office: Judy
Czachowski. student and employee
of the Student Health Center; Lily
El Hadidi. also of the Dental
School: June Rubel. former direc-
tor of PESO: and Pat Roberts.
Rubels secretary.

David Powers. spokesman for
the Chancellor. countered that
only one of the women has actual-
l_v been dismissed. Three resigned
for various reasons. one has been

laid off. and one Iias not had her

contract renewed. The other three
women remain in the employ of
the University.

After the march, the demonstra-
tors went to the Chancellor's of-
fice where they met with Powers.

In a written complaint. the
women accused the I'niversity of

a "flagrant violation of civil
rights. including that of free
speech."

In a Pitt News interview. Pow-
ers expressed the Chancellor's
dismay at these charges.

“We consider it a very serious
charge," he said. “To say that the
University would pursue propon-
ents of activist groups really
strikes at the heart of free speech.
. . . That's what the University is
allﬁabout.”

Powers reported that the Chan-
cellor has written to David Wash-
ington of the Mayors Commission
for Human Relations to ask an in-
vestigation of the women's
charges to insure the innocence
of the University.

June Rubel. spokesman for
UCWR. said it was silly for the
Chancellor to invite a group to in-
vestigate a situation in which the
University would be "the defen-
dam" and found to be guilty.

Powers answered these charges
by giving two reasons for the
Chancellor’s requests.

"First.“ he said. "we don't be-
lieve they‘re (the chargesi. are
true. Second. were in support of
the same things that they're fight-
ing for.

The women have claimed that
the University remains on HEW's
control list that recommends with-
holding Federal grants to Univer-
sitys not having equal employ-
ment opportunities.

However, Powers has said that
the charge is not true. The Uni-
versity has already begun receiv-
ing Federal funds. This fact was
confirmed by a HEW-representa-
tive at a joint meeting of several
women demonstrators, Powers,
and the representative the after-
noon of the demonstration.

Rubel said that the women have
demanded the seven be reinstated
and be given back pay. In addi-
tion. they Iiave requested that the
l'niversity recognize the l'(‘WI{
andobey laws prohibiting sex dis-
crimination.

Powers said the l'nivei‘sity will
take no action until the .\layoi“s
commission. HEW. and the State
Board for Human Relations _have
made their decisions. If the Uni-
versity is shown to be at fault.
full retribution will be made.

AC W0 Protests
April Degrees

One week before graduation
ceremonies. members of ACWO
wrote to the Chancellor and to El-
liot Richardson. Secretary of
HEW. questioning the choosing of
the three people who were to be
awarded honorary degrees.

Mary Lou Burger. spokesman
for the committee. said that the
group "was highly insulted" when
it found out that no woman nor
black had been chosen for an hon-
or.

There was also some question

p as to the choosing of Richardson

when his own department has
been investigating discriminatory
practices at Pitt.

“In a year when the University
has declared itself to be commit-
ted to the advancement of women
and minority groups we felt that
the University had been highly in-
sensitive,” said Burger.

Burger said they also question-
ed the use of honorary degrees.

"Are they awards for scholas-
tic achievement or are they at-
tempts at political maneuvering?"
she asked. .

Burger said that the Chancellor
replied by a letter in which he
took the women to task for ques-
tioning Richardson’s integrity.
He told them that Richardson was
chosen because of what he has
done for humanity—from clean-
ing up the air to working for the
rights of women.

On April 23. the group made a
similar letter public to the media.

SA Moves To Oust

°Da(l(ly’ Atliiiinistratorii

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor
A move is underway within the
Student Association ISA) to oust
Bill .\Iarkus as SA advisor.
The ll-member SA Social Coni-
inission voted unanimously April

28 to seek Markus‘ replacement}

Explaining thevote. Social Com-
mission Chairman Lenny‘KIavon-
ic said that the Social Commis-
sion want an advisor "sympathet-
ic to the goals of students."

"We want an advisor cominit-
ted to the goals we are expound-
ing." Klavonic said.

Committees Commissioner
Wade Lawson agreed that Mar-
kus is not aware of student needs.

"We can‘t have an advisor
whose ideology is far apart from
ours." stated Lawson. “We'd

rather have someone who knows
what were doing and doesn‘t try
and divide us.‘_‘

Lawson also revealed that he
resented Markus‘ “paternaI" con-
cept of the advisers role‘.

“I get the feeling ‘with him that
daddy has to check on little boy's
decisions,” he said. “The Student
Association is for students. and
its decisions should be made by
students.” —

Dissatisfaction with Markus
within SA was heightened recent-
ly when Lawson encountered what
he considered unnecessary delays
in securing bail money for two
Pitt students.

.\Iarkus said that the “came up
with .$6()t) i.i a Iiurry” to post the
bail.

“There was a great deal of im- 
patience on Wade's part,” re- '

marked Markus.

Some SA officials also report-
edly resented Markus‘ hiring Bob-
by Lederman. recently-resigne
SA Financial Director. "He (Led-
ermani was co-opted by an admin-
istrator.” said Klavonic.

Programs Commissioner Den-
nis Concilla. not present at the So-
cial Commission meeting. said
that though SA should have the
right to choose its own advisor. he
was '" . not anxious to replace
Markus."

“An advisor shouIdn’t neces-
sarily be of the same mind as the 2 

Commissioners,” said Concilla.
“What goodgis that? You won't
get any kind of different opinions
if your advisor doesn't offer
them.” -

Concilla said thatias far as he
knew. Markus has not "willfully
tried to block any SA program."

Markus. director of Student Af-
fairs. said that as of this writing
no one from SA has conveyed to
him any messages of dismissal or
disenchantment. He admitted.
however. differences between him
and the student government.

“I'm quite upset with some of
the mechanics of the SA opera-
tion,” Markus said. “There have
been some quick, unilateral, and
imprudent moves by the SA.

Markus agreed that the SA
should pick its advisor but said

that he could not "blindly" sign ‘

his name to contracts.\

Sometimes. in cases where students assumed an
administrative role. they were paid—this practice
should continue.

Firstly. the Commissioners have planned this
move during the spring session when the major-
’lty of the student body is not in residence to
observe and, or object. If these intentions were

Campus Tranquil

by BOB BONN
Opinion Editor

Kl:j.\"l‘ S'I‘.~\'I‘l:j. OHIO tMay 2>—As I drove through a blue
entranceway into the Kent State campus and began to look
around. I couldn‘t help but be reminded of the Pitt campus in
late August. There were buildings and streets and parked cars
and a few cruising campus police. but no people.

It was Saturday. May 1. just a few days before the anniver-
sary of the four Kent killings last spring.

Once inside the buildings. things were a little different.
The Liniversity News Service issued us press credentials and
gave us a reception that was as friendly as a grandmothers.

Outside, there probably weren't 200 students out of the 20,-
000 undergraduates enrolled. V

There's a big flat grassy area here called the Commons.
about half the size of the Cathedral lawn. but with no Cathedral.
There were about .30 people there celebrating Games Day. pro-
claimed by Student Government President Craig Morgan.

I guess I should say that there were only 30 people celebrat-
ing. The other .20 were photographers. small children. and pup-
pies. Im not counting the six or eight that rode by on campus
bicycles.

“Why the photographers just to. get shots of kids flying kites

and blowing soap bubbles?” you may ask. Because people ex-
pect something. . .

There was absolutely no tenseness among any of the stu-
dents. and yet there was definitely an apprehension.

I could see it in the students. I could here it in the voice of
the campus policeman who. when asked a friendly. "Whats
up?" gave a firm. “Nothing."

The people aren’t saying much, but they’re thinking and
they’re acting. Though many Kent students are commuters,
there’s a much higher number of students who decided to visit
home this weekend. The place is nearly vacant.

Security is tight- An ID or a visitors pass is essential to
move around campus.

\\'hy‘.’ According to two reporters for the Kent Stater, the
student newspaper here. people have wondered for months
what would happen on May 4. One reporter said that May 4 was
for Kent students what Decq7 was for their parents. He prob;
ably isn't wrong. »

Now, one year after four students were shot, the event more
than lingers on everyone’s mind. The U.S. is still in Southeast
Asia, and the anniversary is following about two weeks of dem-
onstrations in Washington by veterans and students. _

As this story goes to press. the first serious event of sev-
eral days of activity is about to take place—a reception for Ju-
lian Bond. prominent Georgia legislator.

Monday will bring workshop groups and a speech by Dick
Gregory.

Tuesday, May 4—may be an important day this year, too.
Scheduled is a memorial service and a tree planting. '

Not on the schedule. but still in everyone‘s mind. is the an-

nounced civil disobedience by a group called the May Day"

Coalition. Though no one knows exactly what they have plan-
ned. it is known that the action. if any. will center around the
Rockwell building. formerly a library. that now houses the reg-
istrar and the ROTC department. p

Also. the Coalition plans to bring in outside speakers. which
is in violation of a University rule for this week. The adminis-
tration. of course. wanted as few outsiders around as"possibIe.

At this writing, the campus is quiet but somewhat braced.
Sources at the Kent Stater and elsewhere agree, however, that
if anything happens at all, it is going to happen on Tuesday.

Many key people are in Washington now. and many others
are simply waiting for the calendar to run out its 365 day cycle.

A few people predict that nothing will happen at all. But the
precautions are being taken and no one will be at all surprised
if violence breaks out.

Security is tight. Large numbers, for spotting by aircraft,
have been painted on the roofs of all University buildings.

All that remains now is to see whether or not the precau-
tions are needed . . . and whether or not people will be content

to remember the four students with the proposed sculpture and
the planting of four trees.

Pitt News Exclusive

Tydings Hits Birth Rate

by CAROLE COVAL
Former Senator Joseph Tyd-
ings of Maryland is deeply com-
mitted to protecting the envir-

. onment and arresting population

growth.

During an exclusive intervievi
with the Pitt News last week.
Tydings noted that the Chinese
have circumvented their popula-
tion problem by inaugurating a
voluntary contraceptive service.
guided by the teachings of Chair-
man Mao. According to Nlao.
good citizens limit the number 01
their offspring. “This psychologi-
cal approach has certainly influ-
enced the Chinese growth rate."
T_vdings said. 1

Tydings believes the Malthusi-
an prophecy is “coming home to
roost.” According to Malthus,
population increases in geometric
proportions while food supply
grows in arithmetic proportions.
Tydings predicts that Java, In-
donesia, and East Pakistan will
soon be fraught with riots, vio-
lence, and ultimately revolution.

“No democracy can exist" in a
grossly overpopulated region.
Tydings stated. citing South
America governments as exam-
ples.

T_vdings also linked taxes to
population. “High taxes are a di—
rect result of high population
growth rate.‘-‘ he said.

Although Tydings admitted vot-
ing against the nomination of Wal-
ly Hickel for Secretary of the In-
terior, he praised Hickel’s perfor-
mance in office. “He did .an ad-
mirable job,” Tydings said. “So
much so that Nixon had to fire
him.”

Commenting on the‘ proposed
Trans-Alaskan pipeline. Tydings
said. "If I was Secretary of the
Interior. I would spill some oil in
a controlled experiment to see ex-
actly what extent of precaution
should be taken. Technologically.
the question is whether or not a
spillwill cause damage to the en-
vironment. since the proposed site
is threatened by the earthquake
faultline.“

Of Ralph Nader. Tydings em-
phatically said. “Hes had a hell
of a good impact."

Tydings believes that zero pop-
ulation growth in the United
States is within reach. “We could
achieve it merely by passing bills
that have already been proposed.”
According to Tydings, these bills
are not likely to be passed by pre-
sent leaders. -,

Rumored to be interested in the
post of Attorney General if Sen-
ator Edmund Muskie attains the
presidency. Tydings replied. “If
you‘re asking if I‘m looking for a
job. the answer is no.“ L

Tydings. who was defeated for
re-election by Republican J. Glenn
Beall last September. was rec-
ognized in the environmental field
even before his gun control efforts
in the Senate angered gun owners
in 1970.

Tydings ‘was instrumental in the
attempts to shelve the SST, dis-
courage the Everglades jet port
construction, and aid the passage
of the 1970 Family Planning Act.
This act is regardedby enviro-
mentalists as a major legislative
breakthrough.

During a Wednesday evening
speech. Tydings commented. "We
spend billions for death control.

S

Former Senator Joseph Tydings
News Photo
but just a few pennies for birth
control." He estimated that near-
ly $3 billion is needed from weal-
thy. established countries to in-
stitute family planning programs
in developing countries.
"The developing world needs.
the developed nations need. and

«the United Nations needs a con-

traceptive technique that is logis-
tically easy to distribute. store.
insert. take. etc.," he said.

For a contraceptive to be of op-
timum worth, Tydings said, it
must be simple, reversible, trou-
ble-free, and culturally accept-
able.

Tydings predicted that. if the
average world population contin-
ues to grow at the estimated one
per cent per year. there will be 80
billion people on the earth in 150
years.

cessful playwright who tries to
convince the producer to present

as is——with a male nude scene.
Into this argument is brought a

“HAWK’S WELL” REVIVED

duction—and far superior to last

Plotkins. director. did an excel-
lent job of clarifying and tight-
ening the entire production and
most importantly getting rid of a
"metronomic pace“ that is so of-
ten difficult to avoid in presenta-
tions of this play.

Betty Rothbart delivered an
"extremely fine performance" as_

ONE-ACTS AT THE PLAYHOUSE

The Contemporary Theatre
Laboratory at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse recently ended a run
of three one-acts presented by the
department of Theatre Arts at
Point Park College. Presented
were Terrence .VlcNally‘s Bring-
ing It All Back Home, Edward Al-
bee‘s The Sandbox, and Andre
0bey's Venus and Adonis (trans-
lated by William Beckeri.

Bringing It All Back Home. di-
rected by Don Craig was com-
pletely mis-directed. The entire
flavor and direction was lost‘,

misinterpreted, and poorly cast.
Most of the “message” with all
its humor and irony were lost.
The only performance, of note,
was that of Dan Madio in the role
of Jimmy.

The Sandbox, as directed by Da-
vid Tompkins. was perhaps one of
the finest productions of this play
that I've seen to date. A very tal-

this production the highlight of

Venus and Adonis was directed

somewhat pretentious in others.
it was an enjoyable 30 minutes.

Barbra Streisand. probably one

the past few years. now offers

I 'a different profile in her new al-
f bum Stony End. It is a new ex-

tension for her. an album which

_ hovers in the pop arena instead
of her usual area of balladry.

The album has a strong sha-

dow of composer Laura .\'yro
_ looming overhead in "Hands
of the Man" and "Time and

Love". two Nyro songs Streisand
allowed Nyros vocal style to

own.

His material is uncomplicated

plays stomp piano and rhythm
guitar with drums and bass to

His tunes are unpredictable,
unlike some many where you can
guess the melody.before it leaves
the singer's lips. His rhythms,
too, are pleasantly uncommon.

Strong compositions include
"We Can Go the Distance“.
"She My Woman“. "Oklahoma

 Riopelle’s Debut Scores

by CHUCK LEVINE

Arthur Kopit‘s Chamber Music
currently being presented at
Chatham College. is an experi-
ment in "Grotowski Theatre".

The production approaches Ko-
pit‘s play in a manner whereby
all conventions and cinematic
techniques are “stripped" and
all dialogue is rendered subser-
vient to the body movement of
the actors. Despite excellent dir-
ection by Pitts Bert .\'emitz and
an imaginative introduction of
Grotowski techniques. the show
lacks appeal other than as the
classroom project it is.

The Grotowski approach seems

_too heavily dependent on the

intricate dancelike contortions
and overall physical discipline
of its actors to be successfully

‘ carried out by an untrained cast.

It is in the creation of this
acting style that Chamber Mus-
ic fails. The only member of the
cast of nine who showed enough
body control to approach the de-
image of non-control
was Anna Huntington (Woman
With Notebook). The movement
in “Grotowski Theatre” is in-
tended to be oppressive to the
audience. terse and irritating.
Apart from the first five min-
utes of this production. the au-
dience appeared totally relaxed
and amused. Also. the transition
from frenzied scream» to barely
audible whisper was too smooth
and predictable to create any ten-
sion in the audience.

It is also interesting that Rich-
ard Jakiel (the only male in the
cast) approached his part in a
more conventional way. The
contrast would have been much
more effective had he not been
rather unconvincing and weak.

It must be remembered. how-
ever. that the intended effect
of these actors is something that
takes intensive training. (Gro-
towski's own troupe is a near
communal sect which lives this

style). This productions attrac-
tiveness lies in its display of.
rather than mastery of. the ap-
proach.

Nemitz’s integration of the au-
dience, having the actors move
through, and in many cases re-
act with the spectators, was very
effective. The almost total lack
of set, lighting, costume, and the
ground-plan of the coffee
house itself, involved the aud-
ience well, thus including anoth-
er important technique.

The only actual prop in the
play. the cross of “the Woman In
Armour". was used very imag-
inatively as it served as the ac;
tual symbol of crucifixion. as a‘
table for a decision making meet-
ing. and as a weapon of death.

The direction of Nemitz was
really fine. as the timing and ex-
ecution of the sporadic movement
was visually exact. Also. the
choice of Chamber Music as a
vehicle for the Gratowski ap-
proach seems to have been a
wise one.

The play takes place in a fe-
male mental ward. and centers
around the inmates attempts to
defeat boredom. The original
plan is to invade the men‘s
ward. kill them and eat them.
The girls are all dressed basical-

l-y the same. in their .hospital{“~

The psychotic women lend
themselves well to the frenzied
Gratowski style. as they assume
the personalities of Joan of Arc.
Gertrude Stein. Queen Isabella.
Amelia Earhart. Mrs. Mozart.
etc. Rea Coffee house was the
ward. and it was utilized well.

Thus. anyone interested in con-
temporary innovative theatre.
should find Chathams Chamber
Music to be at least an educa-
tional tune. It will be pre-
sented. again this weekend
(May 6. 7. and 8) at 8:30 p.m.

Also resulting from the dou-

 Diamond Is A Girl’s Best Friend

girls surrounded Lewis and ser-
enaded him with ‘Happy Birth-
day‘.

The added pleasantries. indi-_
cative of a new spirit prevail-

. ing on the mitt squad. result.

from the enthusiasm and con-
geniality of the trio.

Before this season started, Le-
wis searched in vain for the tra-
ditional batboys who assist the
players during the games. He
decided to recruit girls for the
positions and with the helpsof
the team, Lewis located three
willing girls.

"A lot of people laughed at

bie. “But now. a lotof them wish
they had done it because its
really different."

"At first I was shy." added
Geri. "but now I realize how to
do everything. Originally. I was
not a member of the three. but
when one of the girls quit. I got
a chance."

"At the beginning. the guys
gave us lessons. and we even
got a chance to hit in practice."
commented Pat. "In the first
game. we weren‘t exactly sure
what to do and we‘ended up
watching the game."

All three agree that there have
been considerable changes in the
conduct of the ballplayers since
they joined the team.

"They don‘t swear anymore
were around." com-
mented Geri. "They‘re real gen-
tlemen now.“ interjected Pat.

The three divide their duties
of keeping track of the bats,
sweeping the bases, and controll-
ing the stock of baseballs.

"’Now that we’_re taking over.
thingscare done more efficiently
and are more organized.“ said
Geri. "Besides." she added with
a smile. “this is a little cuter."

Some of the group of loyal
Panther fans present at games
probably concur with Geri's_ob-
servation. The trio wears identical
blue and gold knit tops with
blue hot pants.

Although remarks were men-
tioned originally that the bat-
girls may draw new spectators,
all three agree that their actions
are not degrading in any sense.

“Much of the women's liber-I
ation movement is concerned with

Tennis Squad Drops

32 Weekend Matches

(Continued from Page 9)

“We had good weather and it
was a good learning experience,”
Webster explained. “The _boys
saw alot of good tennis played.”

Against the tough Hiram squad
last Thursday. Jorge Gutierrez
scored the only point for Pitt by
taking number four singles in a
21-19 marathon "set his other
score was 6-1.

“It has to be the longest set
I've ever seen played." Webster
remarked. "Jorge is playing real
well."

When Gutierrez finally walk-
ed off the court. he described his
game as one in which "we kept
pushing the ball over the net.
We just tried to hit it over. not
to place it. I'd say we were ev-
enly matched."

As Ed Kline, Pitt doubles
player put it, “the elements were
against us — the weather was

freezing cold and we just seem-.
ed to freeze up in our playing.”

Webster pointed out that the
matches were “closely contested"
and that the team as a whole is
“looking better."

"Bill Wood (third singles play-
er’ for exampie plays brilliantly
but is, inconsistant. He has a
fine serve but just has to work
on being a more consistant
player." Webster explained.

“Another example of improve-
ment is Tom McKnight who has
proven he can play better than
others in singles and doub-
les,” Webster continued. . “He
proved to all of us that he,be-
Qlongs.” ’

“What we really need is to
build up our team.“ the Coach

concluded.

Tomorrow the squad travels-
to Kent State and will have as
Webster put it "a real tough fight
against a fine team. Well be
fighting to score.“

Pitt's three attractive batgirls ride the bench during the Panther’s

involvement on an equal basis
and that‘s exactly what I’m do-
ing." stated Geri. "This is one
of the few ways that I can ac-
tually help the school." ’

"We want to do something
for the school. and it's new and
different." replied Debbie.

“I just hope that more people
would come to the games be-
cause the guys work really hard
and they get very little recogni-
tion,” said Geri.

The girls’ dedication to the
squad is readily apparent during
home contests as they scurry af-
ter dropped bats and cheer exci-
tedly dming Panther rallies. “Ive
become very involved with the
team." said Geri.

As for next season. the three

  At Big Four

Pitt golf coach Rex Peery prov-
ed that he too was a prophet as he
predicted the linksmens second
place finish in the recent Big Four
golf match at Universitjv Park.

Host Penn State captured the
golf championship with a team
score of 364. Pitt finished second
with 379. followed b_v Syracuse
with 383 and previous Pitt con-
queror West Virginia finishing
last with 385.

Link's coach Peery was very

- elated with the team‘s showing.
' "Our boy-s did very good,“ Peery

stated. "The scores were pretty
tight. It was a really close match.“

Typifying how tight the scores
were, the medalist honors were
shared by two Penn State golfers,
Jim Conn and Dan 0’Neill, with
scores of 71.

All of the Pitt shooters finished
within nine shots of the medalists.
Mike Jones was the leading golfer
with a score of 73. He was follow-
ed by Steve Kosalec with a 74.
John Kobala. 75: Tim Crist. 77.
and Ed Bollinger. 80.

OPENING DAY is approaching
—for intramural softball. Leo
Bemis (ext. 66246) is antici-
pating applications from grad-
uate and undergraduate inde-
pendent and fraternity squads.
Bemis will accept entries until
Tuesday, May 4. Meanwhile,
play begins May T0.

A determining factor in the host
Nittany Lions victory could be the
home course advantage. As Peery
stated. "You know. Penn State
played on their home course. We
have done pretty well on our home
course too.“

The Pitt golfers’ record now
stands at 5-2 as they defeated two
more teamsthis past week. On
Wednesday the team defeated St.
Vincent’s in six man match play
by the score of 4-2. Pitt golfer Ed
Bollinger was medalist with 74.

On Friday. Pitt proved to be un-
gracious hosts as they defeated
Cleveland State in ‘medal play.
401-409. In this match. Pitt's
Steve Kosalec was low scorer

vantage.

the pole position Saturday for the
A-Sedan event. His Camaro quali-
fied in one minute, 50.4 seconds.
