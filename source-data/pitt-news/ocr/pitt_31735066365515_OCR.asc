Health Center crisis unresolved

by POHLA SMITH
' News Editor

Though .it appears nothing will
immediately alleviate the. fiscal
crisis threatening services at the
Student Health Center. adminis-
trators are working on a plan that
could end the squeeze in January.

Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe. director
of the Health Center, and Dan Mc-
Fadden, executive assistant to the

'Vice Chancellor for Public Af-

fairs. met Tuesday to discuss sol-
utions to end the deficit spending
threatening the continuance of
health services.

The Center is deficit spending
at the rate of $2-4.000 a month._It
has already spent. $25.000 more
in the first six months of the fis-

cal year than it did last year.
0 McFadden said that last year he 0‘

told Hinchliffe that the Universi-
ty would not be ableto provide any
more revenue per year than the
$250,000 it allocated the Center in
the 1970-71 and 1971-72 fiscal
years. 0

Because that amount has prov- V
, ed insufficient, he has asked

Hinchliffe to review his programs
to see if any could be revised and
to form a plan that would gener-
ate revenue from outside sources.

McFadden has asked that the
plan be submitted by Jan. 1.

The severity of the problem was
recognized when Hinchliffe an-
nounced that a six week backlog

in gynecological examinations had ’

only, until physicians could catch
up on the overload. /

women met with Hinchliffe to pro-

students be given all gynecologic-

‘ al treatment necessary. There

Hinchliffe revealed that the lack
of available funds might soon
force cutbacks in other‘ services
also. i

i Since then there has been much .
speculation about the actual cul-

prit of the economic crisis. Many

“We must build our futu_re from our past." said Gillespie. "Dur-

ing Reconstruction we had nothing but our faith in ourselves and "

dreams for tomorrow. If we "remember our origins. we’ll never lose

sight of our future goals."

Gillespie criticized Women’s Liberation movement as being a

hang-up of the white woman.

“Women’s Liberation is a white frustration of theiwhite woman."

sheisaid. “She’s losing faith in her man. The movement only divide-s
blacks. I’m never going to be free while there‘s hunger and poverty.
and my man isn’t treated as a human being. The term ‘sister’ is sup-
posed to include all minorities and races. but it can’t apply to blacks.
for no white woman has experienced what it is like to be black."

“The black woman‘s role is beside her black man." she added.
"while being the woman she wants to be. If she's a lawyer. or whatever.
she should help out economically.”

Politically, said Gillespie. women should work for child day care
centers and a guaranteed income. not welfare. She exhorted her audi-
ence to become involved.

“What are you doing?” she asked. “How actively involved are
you? Black rhetoric and speeches on black love are beautiful, but work
won’t get done unless we do it.’—’ "

"We lived through slavery.” said Gillespie. "raising the white‘

money to meet the needs of ‘stu-
dents.

l3ut McFadden argues, “I don’t
see there’s anyone at fault. This
year, demand has outstripped
funding.”

Despite a major allotment last
year the Health, Center overshot
its budget by $10,000. To_amelior-
ate the' problem this year the
Health Service was allocated $70.-
000_ to remodel and ‘improve its
facilities. - ’

“The idea‘ was,”. McFadden said,
“that the old one was so ineffi-
cient, we were getting inefficient
use of our physicians’ time. We
thought we’d be better able to ab-

‘ sorb traffic by efficiency.”

McFadden said this year was
to be used as a transition period.
Data would be collected on the
Center so arrangements could be
made for revenues "next year.

"Instead of our making arrange-.
ments next year,” McFadden
said. "it came six months earlier.”

He estimates the Center is go-
ing to need an additional $50-60,-
000 to finish in the black this year
and next year a ‘budget of over
$400,000 will be required to meet
rising demands. '

Hinchliffe said that he has three
fund-generating options available
to him: a student health fee that
would be assessed each student at
the beginning of each term; a
comprehensive insurance plan
that would pay for Health Center
Service as well as hospitalization,

and the institution of minor fees-

for services.

But because. it would take until
next year to get either the health
fee or the insurance plan imple-
mented, 'Hinchliffe said that the
Center will ease this years crisis;
by temporarily instituting fees
for services. - '

“I think unless "some other op-

have any choice. We have already

instituted fees for some services. ,

That is probably only one (meth-
od) that would generate a signifi-
cant amount of money.” N

Constittltion Review,

ﬁnalizes (loeumentt

After nearly four weeks of dis-
cussion. the Constitutional ite-
view Committee has submitted
a prop.0sed Constitution to the
Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee (SAAC). An undergradu-
ate University wide referendum.
tentatively set for Dec. 1. will
follow SAAC approval.

The basic structure of\ their
proposal calls for a seven mem-
consisting of six
members and a chairperson.
which "shall have the powers

' of student governmentff

One of the issues resolved by
the committee was the question
of the Chairpersons power. A
proposal submitted by Paul
Symzcak and others favored

election of the chair person by

the boardtmembers themselves
to "insure cooperation, within
the board and limitation of the
chairpersons powers. . However.
after listening to the rationale
of Steve Kaye and Arnie Stein-
berg. the group felt that the
chairperson. should be elected

‘ by the student body from a slate

of candidates running for that
particular office to insure stu-
dent representation and to fill
the office with a person inter-
ested in chairing student gov-
ernment.

Another proposal to allow all ,

candidates to run at large. with
the highest vote getter being
named chairperson and the next
six highest vote getters being
named to the board, was also re-
jected. since the committee
felt" that a board elected in
this manner would carry many

» of its animosities from the cam-

paign into the board.

The proposed allocations pro-
cedure was engineered to in-
clude an Allocations Committee
of eight members. Budgets of
student organizations will _be
submitted to this committee.
'l‘he Allocations ‘ Committee will
then submit the budget. along
with revisions if necessary to
the board for approval by a
majority of board member-

ship. if the budget is rejected.
' the Allocations Committee. after
reconsideration. submits the bud-
get to the board a second time.
“A final "rejection must have
the approval of five members of

’ ceedings,

mandates immediate passage of
the budget. If the board rejects-
the reconsidered budget, it as-

sumes the responsibility of con- .-£10..

Traveling tale-weaver

bilks the sympathetic

by MARY WELTY '

A handicapped man playing upon the sympathy of several fe-
male Oakland apartment dwellers. bilked the women out of $40 - $60

in bogus magazine subscriptions.

\

The man, whose left arm had been amputated above. the el-
bow, called on Semple St. apartment dwellers several weeks ago.

He was around 21 years of age and said he was soliciting maga-
zine subscriptions to win a scholarship. He said he was working
through a program sponsored by St. Jude’s Hospital in Memphis,

Tennessee.

The women contacted said that the man told them he only

wanted to talk with them

to overcome his shyness. But after he

had told his story and attracted their sympathy, he asked them to

help him win the scholarship.

He took from the women $1 in cash per magazine for handling
and the full subscription payment by check. He gave them each a
receipt and a white card to send to the company to start the sub-

scription.

The women noticed several descrepancies between the ,salesman’s
story and what appeared on their receipts. The mainincongruity
was that the salesman was only supposed to collect his commission
and not the full amount of the subscription.

The remaining amount was to have been sent along with the
white card to the publishing company.

“Astrology is the study of peo-
ple; The only reason I call it as-
trology is that it has to have a la-
bel. If you don’t have a label you
don’t know what you’re doing,”
he said.

"You associate everyday with
people, and you don’t even un-
derstand them. That is why we
are here. We study astrology to
understand ourselves and other
people."

several points interrupted by the
audience for a discussion on in-

Gabby debaters communicate

by VIRGINIA COOK

Debaters are like truck drivers.
They’ll fill _vour ear f'ull of stories
and reminiscences that could pave
the road on the New York to Chi-
cago run. a

They’ll tell you about the time
they had five minutes to run from
one end of Chicago’s O‘Hare Air-
port to the other. burdened
with evidence files, blankets. pil-

lows and knitting (??). and made i

it just as the United ground crew
slammed the door behind them.

Then there was. the time they
stood out in the February cold
spray of Niagara Falls, talking to
two Canadian kids about the war,
the draft, and crime in the streets.

They had a great time at Dis-
neyland, and wouldn’t have miss-
ed Mardi Gras for anything. Oh!
The agony of finding a chapter
of your fraternity yet knowing
you can’t partake of the Boones
Farm because you’ve got to get
up to debate at seven the next
morning. ' ‘

They’ll tell you the stories rea-
dily; you have to dig before
they’ll tell you that debaters do
as" much research as a law clerk,
spend as much time in monthly
travel as an airline stewardess,
meet as many people at a tourna-
ment as the Chancellor at a tea,
and have more friends in differ-
ent parts of the country than a
chronic chain-letter writer.

Maybe yo_u’ve seen them stand-
ing in front of Schenley, leav-
ing for a tournament. Five guys
guarding more luggage than Miss
Pennsylvania takes to the Miss
America pageant. Slight guys;
definitely not jocks.

John Strand’s pants cuffs in-
variably sag down over his shoes,
and his partner, Jim Kearney’s
blond hair curls down over the
back of his collar. Chaz Camic
is always impeccably dressed,
except when his color-blindness
makes him choose the wrong
socks. and his partner, Dave
Green, always has his head tuck-
ed down in his collar, away from
the Pittsburgh cold and pollution.

Dr. Thomas Kane, director of I

debate, is easily identifiable. He’s
the one wearing the tie.

Several other members of the
squad cluster around, passing out
pats on the back and good luck
kisses. A cab pulls up, and the

know that for the last two years

has received an invitation to the

invitation, which in debating
circles ranks with a bid to any
of the Bow.l games.

Maybe you should know that

at the podium in _the Annual Pitt-

them-in garbage cans. Many newspapers were ripped or burnt.

 However, it is important to note that the. freedom of the press,
I whether on or off campus, is no mere trifle.
y- The right‘ to freedom of expression in print must be an integral
_ ' part of any society or community thatclaims to be free.
" Freedom of the press is particularly vital on a college campus.
where the pursuit of truth is allegedly our common goal. Whether
Monday night’s marauders value that goal-is questionable.

Obviously, no newspaper should be immune from criticism. But
even the archfoe of the press, Spiro Agnew, confines his attacks to
harsh rhetoric. He does not stoop to use sticks, stones, or matches.

The resort to theft and arson is not merely juvenile; it is dis-
figr quieting and frightening. -
 It is not a question of law ’n i

order, but of the extent to which

Sculding Pitt News issue burns up

students, grinning commissioner

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Like a dying light bulb, the pale fire flickered
from the garbage can. Inside. an untold number
of Pitt News issues fed the blaze.

It was too late to rescue them.
"Bill,” I said. “grab one of the other cans.“

Bill and I each. grabbed a garbage can full of
papers. He dragged his to the Union, while I car-
ried mine to the Towers.

The sight, I am sure. was ludicrous — the Pitt
News editor and his associate editor staggering
under trash cans stuffed with their newspapers.
while behind them in the quad. a pyre of print
flamed.

Of course. it wasn‘t quite the evening we‘d ex-_
pected. On our way to the Pitt News offices Mon-
day evening. editor Bill Gormley and I'noticed
that the Student Union stands that should have
been overflowing with copies of Monday's paper
were empty. Curious, we left for the Towers Lob-
by to see if the papers were there.

‘In the quad near Brackenridge Hall we were
arrested by three stomach-high, green garbage
cans, standing sentinel-like in a row, piled with
the missing papers.

A small crowd milled about the cans. includ-
ing Bob Ging of the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee, Wade Lawson. the Student Association Com-
mittees Commissioner. Jeff Pasek of WPGH. and
acampus cop.

"Can we talk?“ asked Ging.

“Later." we replied as we began carrying
stacks of the papers back to the Union. ‘ ,

The campus cop did not offer his help. I gath-
er he was "a rookie or something, since the thou-
sand or so campus newspapers lying unread in
garbage cans in the middle of the quad did not
strike him as anything out of the ordinary.

- When we came back for a second load of pa-
pers. I remembered that we never had made it to
the Towers. and by the amount of papers stuffed
in the cans. it looked as though they were also

taken from there.

"I‘m taking these to the Towers.“ I yelled at
Bill. who was stacking. papers in his arms.

As I hurried up the steps. a young man and a
campus cop approached.

“Are you gonna do it now?"

“l)owhat‘."‘

“Burn’em.”

As soon as I deposited the pape1‘s, I ran back
from the Towers, seconds too late.

Like a dying light bulb. the pale fire flicker-
ed from the garbage can. The sputtering flames
were barely bright enough to light the cheshire
grin of Wade Lawson. Lawson was standing over
the garbage can. grinning.

>l< a< =l<  >l< :.~' >l<

Every dramatic incident unfurls its own anti-
climax. and this one was no different.

I suppose our first reaction should-have been
to call the campus cops.’ However, since-a cam-
pus cop had been present at the whole thing and
had not thought it noxious enough to halt, it hard-
ly seemed worthwhile. Later, when we did call
campus security, they told us the matter wasn't
serious.

The entire affair no doubt has its share of vil-

lains. It must have taken a number of people to.

tote the papers from the Union and the Towers to
the quad.

Pasek, seen carrying an armful of papers. said
that he was taking them to WPGH to distribute
to commuters at the station.

Lawson later admitted he had played an "in-
tegral part" in thedestruction of the papers. (In
addition to the papers burned, we found a large
number ripped to oblivion.) As for the actual ig-
niters shredders, Lawson identified them only as a
“group of concerned students.“

‘Much later that night, when being interview-
ed on his part in the evening’s activity. Lawson

. told a Pitt News reporter he’ would "bust" her if

her story were not to his liking.
He asked to see the story before it was print-

ed. when informed he could not. he pointed a

warning finger at us.
“I’m going to do all in my power to close

down this operation,” he pouted.

There is a lesson that must be reiterated so
that a tin bully who expects the world to cower
at his arrogant, outstretched finger will learn at
last.

Hear this, Wade: our papers are flammable,

but our thoughts are asbestos. I ~

 Hormone raising midget heig

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ Per-
sons once destined to live out
their lives as midgets due to hor-
mone deficiency may now have
access to normal lives at nor-
malheights.

Until a few years ago, mid-
gets had little hope of growing
more than 31/2 well-proportioned
feet. Midgets failed to grow be-
cause they lacked an essential
hormone.

Called Growth Hormone, the
body agent is now being supplied

' in limited amounts at Children’s

3' /r.‘~

Hospital in Philadelphia and a
dozen other centers in the United
States} and it is working beauti-
fully.

Unfortunately, the hormone is
so scarce it can be given to a
few of the children who need
it and only sparingly to them.

But the midgets are growing,

' not to normal height in most cas-

 

es, but to a size that is no long-
er obviously abnormal. They grow
between four and five feet. One
child grew 10 inches in a year
of treatment.

Many develop five or six inches
the first year and then slack off
for a total increased growth of
about eight inches.

In the past seven years, Chil-

.dren’s Hospital here has success-

fully treated about '50 midgets
and follows another 150 children
in the Philadelphia area who
need the hormone but must wait
in line for the precious therapy.

Recently, Philadelphia’s St.
Christopher‘s Hospital and Ein-
stein Medical School each re-
ceived a small allotment of hor-
mone to treat another 15 chil-
dren. ,

. In all but a handful of cases,
these children have outgrown
their midget_ heights.

The National Pituitary Agen-

cy in Washington carefully con-
trols the distribution of Growth
Hormone because of its rarity.

The only source of growth hor-
mone is the pituitary gland of
human cadavers,“ and undertakers
often block autopsies needed to
remove the gland by advising re-
latives of the deceased _not to
grant permission. I

Dr. Alfred Bongiovanni, chair-
man of pediatrics at Children's,
said endocrinologistsihave taken
to attending undertakers meetings
to convince them of the need for
autopsies and Growth Hormone.

‘Who Owns America?’

ﬂick cl cm/isions ,4 maria:/4 ant/imnmc/4! 0/ /III/76’

by LOIS THORNTON

As I began reading Walter Hick-
el‘s book, Who Owns America?.I
wasn’t at all sure that I was going
to be impressed. However, by the
time I was less than halfway
through, my attitude had changed
considerably.and I found myself
becoming more and more enthu-
siastic.

I guess. like a lot of people, I
didn’t know much more about
Hickel than the distorted items I
had picked up from the news me-
dia. I did remember the uproar
caused when Nixon appointed him
Secretary of the Interior in 1969.

Conservationists and environ-
mentalists felt that his sympathy
for big industry (particularly the
oil industry) would conflict with
an interest in protecting the en-
vironment.

However, as it turned out, Hick-
el did a commendable job while he
was in the Cabinet. He was ex-
tremely effective in developing
positive environmental programs
and he won many friends among
the youth and the conservationists.

On the other hand, he lost a few
friends when he attacked the in-
dustrial pollution problem (espe-
cially the oil companies). After
that famous letter to President
Nixon accusing the administra-
tion of lacking concern for the
young ( Hickel has seven
sons, the oldest is 29) and asking
that Vice President Agnew’s tir-
ades against students be toned
down, Hickel’s relationship with
the President deteriorated stead-
ily.

Finally, after only 22 months
as Secretary of the Interior. he
was called into the Presidents of

fice and fired.

Well, it’s all in the book, all 22
months of it. And even though it’s
occasionally quite apparent that
he is giving you only the facts that
make him look favorable and a lot
of biased personal recollections
and viewpoints, he seems so
straight forward and sincere that
you can’t help feeling a lot of sym-
pathy and respect for the guy.

He includes a lot of biographical
material which is particularly in-
triguing. He spent his childhood
on a tenant farm in Kansas and
landed in Alaska at the age of 21
with only 37 cents and a lot of
ambition. In less than 20 years.
with a great deal of hard work.
self-confidence, and foresight he
built a construction business val-
ued at $14 million.

His interest in the ltepublican
Party. and especially Richard

Nixon. is brought out. although he
seems to soft—pedal his own po-
litical ambitions. In the numer-
ous anedotes he relates about his
adventures in politics. he depicts
some of the foolishness and weak-
nesses of the men and the system.

He waxes quite philosophical,
especially in the last two chap-
ters. This is where the idea in the
title predominates, although he

does discuss it throughout the book.

Who Owns America‘? Hickel an-
swers that all Americans do. from
the poorest ghetto child to the
wealthiest corporate president.
This country's vast resources. in-
cluding the air. water. and public
lands. belong to all the people and
notjust a special few.

responsibility. A large part of that
responsibility involves protecting
our nation's resources from ex-
ploitation. Ultimately. Hickel
feels that the Federal Govern-
ment should assume the leader-
ship and the obligation of owner-
ship to protect and care for
America’s resources.

Even though some of his exper-
iences aren‘t always encouraging
Hickel seems to carry a note of
optimism through his book. His
attitude is that we are in a per-
iod when people are finding the vi-
sion to demand a new direction.
He feels confident that what lies
ahead’ is an “environment of
hope” for the owners of Amer-
ica.

A “pro-life” weekend with
a “Thanksgiving for Life”
theme is scheduled for this
weekend. Sponsored by Wo-

by MARGIE CARSON

"Anything that creates a small
world in which men writing verse
can reach audiences is good and
should be supported," comment-
ed poet Archibald MacLeish about
the International Poetry Forum
here. 5 .

MacLeish will read a selection
of his poems at the Forum Wed-
nesday. Dec. 8. at 8:30 p.m. in
Carnegie Music Hall on Forbes
Ave.

The poet does admit. however.
that poetry is a personal encoun-
ter. not a "mass operationf’,

“Poetry is always one man’s
experience, both in the writing

and in the reading,” he said in a:..

recent interview.

"-The great problem in poetry
always is the problem of the au-
dience. and the problem grows
worse as civilization advances‘-
if that‘s the word I want."

"What has happened with poe-
try is that we have a very gen-
eral literacy and large numbers
of people could read poetry or lit-
erature of any serious sort. but
don’t because it is easier to look

at the TV set,-” he added, with a,

touch of irony in his words.

MacLeish'does not feel poetry

ever loses its power or is in dang-
er of it, because he finds it to be
the most universal of the arts:

“No society has ever been found
which did not use poetry or incan-
tation or rhythmic words or
chant. Poetry seems to be funda-
mental human attribute and can

 Cats out to erase Lions

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

The Series: Pitt's final home game of the 1971 season will be
with the Lions of Penn State in the 68th meeting of the two schools.-
The series started in‘1893 is one of the oldest and biggest rivalries
in college football. Pitt leads the all-time slate 35-32 with three
ties. but Penn State has won the last five games and nine of the last
12. A crowd of 40.000 is expected at the stadium.

The Records: Unbeatable is what Penn State has been this sea-
son sporting a 9-0 record going into tomorrow's contest. Their vic-
tims have been .\'av_v (56-3). Iowa (44-14). Air Force (16-14). Army
«42-0). Syracuse (3110). TCL' (66-14). west Virginia (35-7). .\lary'-

land (63-27). and .\'.C.State (35-3).

' As for the Panthers. their pattern has been set at a victory follow-
ed by two losses. They beat UCLA 2:)-25. only to come home to
lose to Oklahoma 55-29 then to west Virginia in ;\Iorgantown 20-9.
A comeback victory over Navy (36-35) was followed bv a sound de-
feat at the hands of Tulane (33-8) in the Sugar Bowl. Boston Col-
lege thrashed the Panthers 40-22 but Pitt came‘back to beat the
Orangemen of Syracuse in the stadium the following week 31-21.
Successive loses to Notre Dame (56-7) and Army (17-14)(set the

stage for tomorrow's game.

Offensively: According, to Pitt coach Bill
,State is the greatest offensive team that I‘ve seen at Penn State in
the last three years. They have an explosive offense that is always «
capable of breaking the longrun—very comparable to Oklahoma.
although they lack the overall speed of the _S.ooners."‘ Lydell Mit-
chell with 25 touchdowns holds the NCAA inaI~E“‘i?T~’”§¢6r'é‘s i}i""5"'
season. He is flanked by fullback Franco Harris with John-Huf-
nagel directing traffic. When the rushing game falters. a rare oc- '
currance, tight end Bob Parsons usually gets the pass receiving
assignment. "They run from a basic I-formation. If they need the
short yardage they go to the Power-I and use fullbacks Franco
Donchez. both extremely fine runners," added

Harris and Tom

In ‘the past few years the rivalry aspect
of the clash has been somewhat tarnished-
PSU has prevailed since 1965. Yet both op-

posing coaches realize that this game still .

means a great deal. V .

'-‘‘People who knew each other in high
school will be playing against each other,”

— stated Joe Paterno. “It heightens the drama

of the game-that’s what college footballis
all about.”

“We recruit competitively against Penn
State and our players know their players
well,” said Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua.. “We
wonlt have any trouble getting the kids up

‘for this one.”

_Senior defensive end Andy .Mollura
agrees."‘This is a hot game. Personally, I
have a score to settle with Penn State,” he
added. 

Mollura, who has played four positions
in his three varsity years at Pitt, admits that
now is the time to put everything together.

“It’s time everybody stopped putting the
blame on somebody else,” he emphasized.

“We’re so capable of doing well. It hurts. »

when you lose and you know that you have
the material.”

With the season almost over, Mollura
recognizes that “the team‘ has to go out and

start proving itself. A win would make the _

year a bit brighter.”

Mollura cites mistakes as the major pit-
fall for -this year’s Panthers. “We can win
if we put’ it all together and eliminate the
mistakes. We’ve lost three games because
of them.” '

Against. Army, Mollura feels that the de-
fense solidified as” a unit. “We were com-

l_ ing up with the biglplays. We’ll'have to V"
contain Penn State’s running game, this ’ '
..‘weeﬁk.9) . ‘ i‘ V’ .   ‘_ i V y _ _

' 1'»

 

ers should be counted out. “If ‘the team can

‘jel, it’s going to be a tough ball game.”

Earlier in the week, quarterback Dave
Havern observed that, “there is a lot more
pressure on Penn State than us. We don’t
have anything to-lose except our pride.”

Mollura, whose hometown is Johnstown,
wants to win‘ for another reason. “I live
halfway between Pitt and Penn State and
I’m personally sick of hearing about Penn
State when I go home in the summer.” .

Pitt’s last victory over PSU came "on a
last second field goal in the. 1965 game. The
score of .30-27 was considered a_major upset
then, and anything similar would certainly
be an upset tomorrow. . -

Anything short of a superb’ effort by the
Panthers will send the Lions to a major

bowl once again. _ n

 10—TH}lElPlITT Nl3WS—Friday, November 19, 1971

Ex-booter lashes out at Athletic Dept. 

Kruth went on to assert that all
the Athletic Department is inter-
ested in is “fielding representa-
tive teams in the minor sports so
they can say in their brochures
that they have a dozen different
teams and have an overall win-
ning record which makes them
look good’.

The former fullback also went
on to state that the athletes in the
minor sports are largely ignored
by the athletic director and his
staff.

“If they really cared about the
troops in the trenches tthe ath-
ietes) the AD and his staff would
come to more of the games."
Kruth noted that when the Al) did
make a rare visit to a game the
team played better. He cited the
8-1 Slippery Rock slaughter as one
example.

Kruth is not the only booter dis-
satisfied with the Athletic Depart-
ment. Earlier this year Ali Rdis-
si, the team’s leading scorer last
season, departed the squad, cit-
ing the ' Athletic Department’s
“lack of concern.” Ali was parti-

Vcularly upset over the fact that

the department cancelled the Dav-
is-Elkins (West Virginia) pre—sea-
son game because the department
felt that the contest was “an un-
necessary expenditure.”

Thus the team entered the sea-
son cold and barely beat Bucknell
and then" lost to West Chester
squad. 3-2. Jerry and Ali felt that
had the team been allowed to pla_v
some pre—season matches they
wouldnthave lost to‘West Chester.

Kruth also faulted Pitt's facil-
ities saying '.'e\'en little West
Chester has far superior training
facilities-to ours. its amazing to
see the fantastic job that our
trainers do in spite of the terrible
training facilities.”

The booter also knocked'Dean
Billick for failing to properly pub-
licize the minor sports. “All he

and his staff care about in the fall

is football. He didn’t even care
enough to post our schedule. We

had to print and distribute our A

9!
o

OWII

Kruth also backed Dennis
Schatzman's allegation that ath-
letes are denied access to the
training table. The reason Mys-
linski gave Dave Adams for not
feeding all athletes is that a meal
at the training table costs-$2.50
and they can't afford that. Well if
they can‘t afford at least $2.50 for
somebody who puts out all he has
every day then I say they should
can the whole program.

"Guys are expected to sweat it
our everyday and yet in return re-

ceive nothing unless they are one .

of the lucky few that are on a full

Amoco Super—Premium gives you all these benefits plus
better mileage than other premiums. It's the only anti-
pollution premium gasoline you can buy.
