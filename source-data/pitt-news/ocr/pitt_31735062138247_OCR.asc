      ms. 27  

Function, Will ‘be Held at
Schenley Hotel, Chairman

A McCrackeri. Announ'ce‘s.

7 Tickets tobe Placed on Sale
Within Week or Two

 

 

 

The date and scene of the Junior
Prom have i been announced. , The
largest social function of.the year Will
be held February 27, at the Schenley
Hotel, according to an announcement
Monday by Chairman G. H’. McCracken_
The date was chosen only after care-
ful consideration of the social cal-
endar. It is believed. by committee
members that February 27 will not
conflict with other social events. The
Hotel Schenley was selected because
it is centrally located for Pitt stu-
dents and is close to the campus.

The committee has not been idle
during the Christmas vacation period
and now has the plans well in hand.

a. week or two and little doubt that
they will ﬁnd a ready demand is felt
by those in charge. ~ ’ '

Plans now call for accommodations
for the largest crowd of Pittites that
ever attended ,a. Prom. Alumni are
also expected to gather in large num-
bers. \ ' L ,

Chairman',McCracken makes a plea
for a representative gathering at the
Prom».  He wants "the fraternities to
get solidly bghind it. He wants the
non-fraternity men to support it as
in the past.
as a distinctly Pitt affair to be pre-
served by the unqualiﬁed boosting of
every Pitt student.

Only about six weeks remain before

the Prom and President Murray .01’--

the Junior class urges those who in-
tend to -go to buy their tickets as soon
as they are oifered for sale. The ex-
penses of preparation will be heavy
and bills must be met promptly. To
Juniors he points out that it they
never attended La Prom before, they
should be at the one held by their-
own class.‘  -

The association formed by the

ization, held its ﬁrst annual banqu
in the. Fort Pitt hotel _Friday, Decem‘
ber 19. Several feasts had been held
previously to “feel out” the sentiment
of the men concerning the proposi
tion of coming together at certain in-.7
tervals. A special effort was made
to have every member, no matter how";
far distant from Pittsburgh, present;
and the committee was rewarded by
an attendance of almost 100. _ .;

The banquet was not limited to t is"
former enlisted men as the former
officers were also invited to be pres’...
ent. They responded almost to an n"1an._A

 II. E. IIAVIS

G,ra;duate Manager K. E. Davis has
just come forth with the announce-
ment of a. football schedule for next
fall which will, no doubt, prove as
great, a test for the gridders as the
one completed last Thanksgiving day.
In fact the new program is practically
the same as the»1919 camd, except that
Lafayette has ‘a. «place and Carnegie
Tech is dropped. These two features,
at least,-, are sureto be pleasing to all
Pit-tites. Everyone is anxious to ‘see
the team coa ‘ _ by Jock Sutherland,
the famous Pant er athlete. '

Much disappointment has been ex-
pressed at the fact thatboth ~the.Penn
and Syracuse games are to be played
awayfrom thome. . Pittsburgh football
followers were particularly anxious to‘
see the Penn game, inasmuch as next
season was Pitt’-s -turn to this en-A
counter at home. However, ,with
Geneva, West‘ Virginia, Georgia Tech,
Lafayette, W. & J. and_ Penn State to
be seen at Forbes Field, the home boys
will not have to go entirely without
their thrills. , ‘ .

Look this schedule over and see if
you can see any soft spots or resting
places in it. p Also, observe that the
period from November 13‘to November,
25 is vacant. During that period, we‘
are going to eat raw meat and on the
Thanksgiving we are going to have
the Nittany Lion’s,hide. *

sity were’ asked to go to various in-
‘st‘itu1'tions' to sing carols on Christ-
mas eve. ;On account ofschooll clos-
ing before this time, the committee
thought it would have been too hard to
reach the girls, so it was decidedto
sing the carols on Friday night, De-
cember 19. _ ‘

About 30 girls met_,_in front of State
Hall at 8:30. Under the_‘=;leadersil1.ip of
Mrs. Miller and Mrs.-_ Pietenpol, the
girls started on their way. Among the
institutions visi-ted were the Juvenile
Detention Home, the Pittsburgh Home
for Girls, the Blind Institute and the
Ward Home for Babies. The girls also
sang‘ at the homes of Dr. ,‘Kelly and

‘Dr. Sage. The. singers ﬁnished at the
home of Prof. and Mrs. Miller, where

"dainty refreshments were served.

girls were furnished by Pitt" girls.

Director Charles S. Miller attended
the meetings‘ of’ we National Col-
legiate ‘Athletic Association‘ and of the
Athletic Research Society in New
York during the holidays. The meet-
ings were attended by representatives
from 167 colleges from Maine to Cali-
fornia, and’? many athletic problems
were discussed.’ . .
Professional football -for college men
was-lcondemned, and it was recom-
mended to the colleges comprising the
association that they take away the
le‘tters from . all varsity men, who
either as graduates or undergraduates,
participate in I profeissional football
games, and that colleges-employ no
men as coaches who -are identiﬁed
with the -professional games, and that

who offici-ate at professional games._
Post-season football games, such as
the Harvard-Oregon game, were frown-
ed upon, and the associationwent on
record in- opposition to such games as
being against the interests of the sport
and contrary to the etlhzics-of college
life. - ' A .
_ It was also recomem-end.ed that mem-
bers of_ the association arrange their
‘schedules‘, as nearly. as ‘possible, with
colleges who have thefreshmen rule,
theinigra.-tory‘ rule and the, three-year
rifle.-I

  Miller-Vusays:  was shown‘ con-

the -smaller colleges, as so. often af-
ﬁrmed in the East,-and that the adop-
tion of these rules by all colleges,
large, and small, would effectively
eliminate the‘ migrating or tramp
athlete.‘ We have not been troubled
with this type of. athlete at Pitt, but
_there_ have been too many of them on
‘other -college teams in this district re-
cently. , .

Boxing met with much favor in the
discussions at the meetings, and it
was recommended that it be intro-
duced into the colleges of the associa-
tion as a competitive sport. .Dr. R.
Tait McKenzie’"of the University of
Pennsylvania, had a paper on this sub-
ject. ‘ ' 1 " -

The regular monthly convocation‘ of

‘was. held December 17, student hour
,in the Heinz House. The Senior Stunt
-afford-ed pleasure by way of a little
friendly satire on the question of
_.-Henry C.’ Frick’s gift to the University
of Pittsburgh of a victrola. After the
presentation of -the instrument, the.
girls were entertained by the render-
ing of a very beautiful record-produced
in the Victor studio by Miss Marjorie
‘Stewart. _ . ~ .

Following the entertainment, reports
of -the Eaglesmere andwstudent Self-
. vernment Conferences ‘were given
_ y‘,Ann_a Dodds and Rose Fine, the
rep_res'entativesl of W. ‘A. A. to these
respective meetings. ‘ -

Miss Fine made ,a‘ plea for self-
government of the women student
body separate from‘ the men,‘and cited‘
several-instances where such aiplan
has~ proved satisfactory in; other
schools.‘ The main feature of such
government is to stimulate in the
students an active, rather than a.
passive interest, which should create
a progressive and constructive school

burg, ‘shortly ‘before the Christmas

Now that ‘the holidays are over, the
Pitt basketball team is down tohhard
work preparing for the rest of -the
winter ‘campaign. P h . ‘

Next on the 1 schedule. comes the
game with Grove City, which is to be
played‘ at ‘Trees gymnasium next Fri-
day evening. g : ‘ . .

Hard Game Expected-.

Tha.t'Grove ‘City has a. strong team

is shown by their great work in de-

feating Yale in the first game played.

by the big Blue team in the holiday
invasionﬁof Western Pennsylvania. In

.this game the. boys who meet the

Panthers Friday night showed ﬁa.-shes
of great speed, brilliant passing and
accurate shooting. ,

At forward is Kendrich, a brother
of Tom Kendrich, the former Pitt
-athlete. Young ‘Kendrick learned the
game at Duquesne -High School. He
afterward played ' for ‘-the Westing-
house team, which defeated the Pen-
thers lastyear.

Smith, at the other forward, is a
good natural p'laye‘r, with lots of ex-
perience. His work stood out in the
game against Yale. _ l
‘ At center, Ruddick has been playing
"good. ball, and much is expected of
him by Grove City followers.

Captain Gould plays a guard posi-
tion, and his work has featured every‘
game played byhis team this. ye-ar.
Stephanian plays the other guard po-
sition, and he was a big‘ factor in

‘keeping down ‘Yale’s score.

_ Pitt Working Hard.

- CoachhF1int has the Pitt boys work-
ing in earnest now, and a big improve-
ment. in all lines of the game is‘ex-
pected. None of 4 the positions‘ are
cinched, and -it looks as thoughpa new
man or two will break into the varsity
‘combination at any time. ‘

The_Freshmen are expected to play

a. preliminary to the big game Friday

‘evening, but their opponent has, as

yet,‘not been -announced by Manager
Haines. ,

‘ The indoor track is nearing comple-
tion and will be ready for use within
the next two weeks. Director Mil-ler
announces that a series of relay races
between classes, d-epartinents and fra-
ternities will be held during the Win-
ter and early spring. -

’It is the plan to deviate from the
usual custom of running four men on
‘a team and have teams of "eight-and
ten men, in order to add uncertainty
to the contests and secure a greater
number of contestants. Plaques or
cupswill be awarded! thewinners as a
special stimulus.

The new track is a beauty, and will
be a wonderful aid to Coach Kerr in
developinghis track squad this spring.

‘ PRIIVES "JAZZ" AFFAIR
The School of ' Economics “Pep
Party” was"a success. A large attend-
ance was not forecast by the demands
for tickets, but the enthusiastic crowd
that -turned out somewhat taxed the
Y. M. C. A. building. ‘ ' _
There weren’t- many -{dull moments.
Informa-.lity was the — keynote of the

entertainment. - It is a. safe bet that
if any Economics student didn't know

all his fellows when he entered the

“Y” be had no excuse for not calling
them by their ﬁrst names when he left.
. Liggett and Braun brought their jazz
boxes with them and eased their edu-
cated ﬁngers over  strings, with
lbclat that was very pleasing to the
party at large. They were assisted
(or hindered) at “times by various
artists on the piano ‘or drums. ‘While
melody was in‘ the air, the lions and
the lambs (professors and pupils) sat
down and smoked together, while Dick
Love‘ and Frank Maxﬁeld, as masters
of ceremonies, waited here and there
through the ‘assemblage, moving a
chair here, bringing up a footstool

there, passing smokes, lighting them‘

and playing the part of genial ‘hosts
in the best committeemen style.
