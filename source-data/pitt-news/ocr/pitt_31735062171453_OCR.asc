MDC President Attacks
Proposed   SG Constitution

by JANE HENDERSON

Serious objections have been
raised concerning the revised Stu-
dent Government (SG) Constitu—
tion. According to SG Senator and
Men’s. Dorm Council President
Arnie Steinburg, the students will
be getting a bad deal if it goes
through.

Speaking as a representative of
the students, Steinburg stated
that “a look at the Constitution
will reveal that it is very ideal-
istic.” He clarified the statement
by saying that it wasn’t realistic
to envision four separate people
working and cooperating that
closely.

He continued, noting that the
new Constitution calls for a num-

. ‘Fer of elections during each
year, including elections for rep-
resentatives from each school for
each committee. '

One of Steinburg’s major objec-
tions centered around the Alloca-
tions Committee. As a self-per-
petuating body it would be set up
so that it would have to respond
to no elected student. “It can be
looked at as a dictatorship of a
bureaucracy, Steinburg empha-
sized, “Success of the Commis-

' sioners’ programs, therefore,
would be‘ dependent on the prefer-
ences of this committee’s mem-
bers. .

WRITERS CONFUSED

Continuing, Steinvurg pointed
out that “two different versions of
the revised Constitution are cur-

“Just like a particular style of
murder that becomes publicized,”
said Robert Merrit, superinten-
dent of Campus Security, “bomb
threats which make the newspa-
per somehow end up with other
people doing the same thing.”

Merrit added, “There are deep-
seated psychological reasons for
bomb threats. There are people
who derive some sort of gratifica-
tion to think that by a mere tele-
phone call they can empty a build-
ing.”

Last week Merrit was question-
ed concerning the recent bomb
Jcares at the University.

“When we receive a call giving
notice of a bomb at the University
of Pittsburgh, we obviously can't
evacuate the entire University
and conduct any meaningful
search; so we do nothing--we
pray,” he added. .

“In my view,” he said, “there
are two different types ob bomb-
ers. First, there is the bomber
who wants to blow something up
for whatever reason, or maybe he
wants someone killed along with
that. The other type of bomber
wants an explosion to occur, but
doesn’t necessarily want to take
human life or wants to minimize
that. So he times his call too late
for you to stop the explosion, but
soon enough to minimize danger
to human beings.”

;,According to Merritt, when-
ever the department receives a
bomb threat, the first action they
take is evaluating the call.

If a call is evaluated as legiti-

mate, the department then evac-

On. '

In one version the word of the
Allocations Committee is to be
final, while in the other commit-
tee’s decisions are to be subject to

dispute by student representatives.

Ambiguities in wording result
in confusion concerning qualifica-
tions. The Constitution states that
“any sophomore, junior, or senior
in good standing” is qualified for
election to the judicial, but it does
not specify whether this means
incoming or outgoing students. .

The Consitution also states that
“those students with the highest

uates the appropriate areas as
necessary, notifies the Pittsburgh
Police Department Special Serv-
ices or Bomb and Arson people
and conducts a search. .

In case suspicious object is
found, Army demolition units are
available to dispose of it.

“What we’re trying to do in the
face of this mounting problem is
to get ourselves acquainted with

total vote corresponding to the
number of seats available will be
elected. Steinburg sees no reason
why all the seats cannot be avail-
able at the same time since all
terms are for one calendar year.

MORE CONFLICTS

Steinburg went on to elaborate
on a number of other conflicting
sections of the Constitution in-
cluding “the listing of things out-
side the realm of their authority.
For example, who will appoint

different people to different
committees?”
Conflicts also exist in the

division of powers and duties
given to the four commissioners
and, according to Steinburg
these could enable the four to
give and take powers from each
other. .

The Constitution states that
“the function of the Judicial
Board shall be the final board
of appeals to all other student
judicial boards of Men’s Dorm
Council and Women’s Housing
Board only appeal to the Di-
rector of Housing and Stein-
burg feels that SG should have
no power to usurp this author-
ity.

the problem, to devise procedures
and to train people to cope with
it,” Merrit commented. “So our
department is reviewing the pro-
cedures we presently have and
trying to make them better.”

Merrit is setting up training
classes in bomb search and bomb
recognition. . «.

Black Week on Monday.

Dockens Advocates His

"Gospel of Revolution”

by CAROL SCATES

Rev. Dr. Reggie Dockens, Black
philosophy professor at the Uni-
versity, kicked off Black Week
activities with a speech entitled
the “Gospel of Revolution” on
Monday. He told the noon crowd
that his tools are the Bible, the
book, and the bullet, which he said
is “beautiful is used properly.”

He began by comparing himself
to the Black teachings of Jesus in
the temples, setting liberty to the
oppressed.

Gospel, which he said means
good news, in Swahili, and that
one day men shall be liberated.
But he said before this can be true
the “whitey lie about Christ must
be abolished. Christ was like the
Black man, more ss than the blue
eyed blonde,” he continued. He
said that Jesus was a revolution-
ary in his day.

“Christianity was good to keep
the slaves and poor Blacks sub-
missive,” and this he said is what
has kept Blacks oppressed for so
long. “Nothing makes a master
happier than having happy slaves,

who turn the other cheek and ac- ’

cept brutality humbly,” he con-
tinued. .

Dockens said that the Black
psyche has been perverted.

Scares

with them, because you're always
faced with the horrible knowledge
that if you make a wrong decision,
people can be killed—and yet
you’re faced with the fact that
your decision can mean a disrup-
tion of University activities,” said
the superintendent.

“And bombs come in any shape,
size or form, and so make the job
of search extremely difficult,” he
added.

“There are 100 synomyns for
white, all good,” he said. “And 66
for Black, all bad.” He cited “an-
gel food cake” and “devil food
cake” as examples of how this has
been incorporated into our think-
ing. “It is impossible for whites
not to have this sort of thinking,”
he went on. “They are conceived,
born, and nurtured in racism.

“We are not Americans, for we
do not have American privileges,”
he went on. “The white man creat-
ed the Negro, and our sin has been
in accepting him. He advanced
that this is what the Black church
has been teaching for so many
years, and it must be converted.

“We are still slaves. Original-
ly, slaves were made dependent
on his master. Taken away from
his family, religion, and culture
made him dependent on the slaye
owner. He was made to believe
that he was not worth anything,”
which Dockens said is a concept
still taught in the Black church.
The young professor paralleled
the mobility of ghetto blacks with
slaves in chains on planations,
saying, “only 32 per cent or the
country is available to Blacks.

REV. DR. REGCIE DOCKENS
Kicks Off Black Week

Sixty-eight per cent is not avail-
able to non-whites. All of us are
still living on the plantation.” .

He said that the solution is to
see ourselves differently and not
as a violent nation. “The Black
church must realize and deal with
this violence.”

“If your religion doesn’t serve
you any better now than it has,
then you don’t need it,” he assert-
ed. “The church is wealthy, an in-
stitution, and must serve the peo-
ple, or else it must go.”

The church does not recognize
that people hust humanize the sys-
tem, according to Dockens, “just
like whites didn't hear our cry un-
til we said motherfucker and
burned. We had to hit them over
the head before they heard.” .

Dr. Dockens emphasized that
violence is not an end, but a
means. “Our ultimate sacrifice
must be made in order to get our
freedom, by what ever means ne-
eessary, for “freedom is given to
those who deserve it and are cap-
able of getting it,” he said. “So
we must either live as slaves, or
do what is necessary for our free-
dom. ,

“You’ll never recall a time

contends Steinburg. This stipula-
tion, he feels will give members
of “the gang” more time to urge
their friends to come on and
vote for the revision.

Finally, with the four com-
missioners, Steinburg main-
tains that there will also be a
problem of deciding who will
represent the student body at
such things as board meetings,
committees, dinners and orienta-
tions, which are presently attend-

has passed that state, he must
then identify the opressor and the
oppressed. ”

Dockens feels that the concept
of Black power frees all men,
both black and white; “the bigot
from his prejudices, and the Black
man from his chains.”

But he pointed out that Black
power is not the same as it was
during the 60’s and that Black
leaders now have moved to a uni-
versal concept, extending a
sphere of inﬂuence conceived to
neutralize the white man.

Commenting on the system
which should be employed for
Black liberation, he said, “Capit-
alism sets one brother against an-
other. Socialism and Commun-
ism are not necessarily the an-
swers either, but the best system
is the one that puts human need
first, then afterwards, fluctuate
to others.”

Don Olsavicky, choir treasur-
er, cited an example of the
choir’si “dedication and concen-
tration.” One time Anderson pre-
sented _the Choir with a diffi-
cult piece one week before a
choir tour.

Although it normally takes
three weeks for the group to
learn a piece, they met the
challenge, perfecting the piece
in the alloted time.

Kim Fetchko, Choir presi-
dent, feels the reason for trf
success of the choir is the
comradarie of the members.

She explained that a group
must blend well before it can
sing well. Commenting on the
warm and friendly atmosphere,
Kim added, “It’s like that all
the time.”

The Choir will present its
next concert December 6 in the
Heinz Chapel.

professors this past summer.

After much argument, the 40
future members decided that
membership in the union would
be open to faculty and student
staff who are engaged at least
part-time in teaching, research,
library and information services.

This includes all salaried grad-
uate students whether they re-
ceive their funds from the Uni-
versity or from grants.

The governing body of the
union will be the Council. Mem-
bers of this body will be elected
by their departments, with one
Council member for every 10
people in the department who are
members of the Union.

The purpose of the organiza-
tion is to “protect individual
and academic rights through col-

( lective bargaining” with the Uni-

versity administration. It will
also secure the jobs of the in-
dividual and upgrade economic
conditions.

The Professional Union is spec-
ifically seeking to:

(1) Protect individuals from
discharge for political noncon-
formity.

(2) Eliminate discrimination by
sex, race, politics, religion,
family or marital status in con-
ditions of employment, salary,

Things Are Changing? Think About It A little More

by BOB GING

We were sitting up talking,
late the other night, and the con-
versation got around to all of the
things that have changed in the
last ten years. We started about
talking about all the things that
have changed in general, and our
reminiscing brought us into
more specific things.

I turned to my friends, and
said, ‘fyou know, when you think
about all the things that have
happened you get really elated
. . . but when you think about it a

little more. . .” And I started
thinking about it a little more.

Tne years ago Martin Luther
King was just beginning to
march and boycott, and stir
things up down south. Rap and

and a lot of people were starting
to get scared. If you're ten years
old and living in white suburbia,
it’s natural to go along with ev-
eryone else and be a little scared
too.

A lot of people were going
South to work in voter registra-
tion drives, trying to give what
help they could, and it was a
start. Bob Dylan was singing a
song about a bullet in the back
killing Medgar Evers, but most
people weren’t listening to him.

As time went on, the newspa-
pers started telling about all of

the good things white people‘

were doing for black people, let-
ting them ride in the front of
busses, vote, letting their chil-
dren go to white schools, and I
felt good that I was a liberal.

Stokely and others were com-
ing across as radical militants,

I looked at my friend again,
and he knew where I was coming

State Welfarelicy
Decisions Hurt Poor

by ROSS PARKER.

Hundreds of poor people in Allegheny County now trying to get a
college education and a new life are in danger of losing this opportunity
because of recent policy changes made by the Department of Public
Welfare in Harrisburg. Caseworkers have been instructed to subject
college students dependent upon ‘general assistance‘ to employment
regulations.

They are required to reregister periodically at the Bureau of Em-
ployment Security until a job is produced. Unless an employable person
demonstrates to the department that he is trying to get and hold a job,
he is cut off from assistance.

Thus the student who is forced to accept a job is faced with the al- ‘

ternative of either giving up his plan for an education or else somehow
holding a job while attending classes.

Another obstacle to poor people striving for an education is the
elimination of transportation funds. Before the September first
changes,» student recipients were allowed a small amount of money to
pay bus fare to and from class. This assistance now has been ter-
minated.

The only student recipients exempt from the new regulations are
those who are assisted by the Aid to Dependent Children program and
who live at home with their parents. Even ADC children will be sup-
ported only through their freshman and sophomore years, according to

’ a memorandum by Chauncey Gunderman, acting commissioner of the

  

 

 

Office of Family Services.
This move seems to be intended to channel poor people into one and

— two year training programs rather than give them the opportunity of
“attending a four year college available to the advantaged.

There also appears to be a conflict with federal ADC guidelines
which specifies that assistance is to continue until the child reaches
age 21. Thus, many college juniors entitled to employment exemption
and transportation allowance will apparently be deprived of these
services.

Several other regulation changes will impair a poor person from
getting a good education. Most people under the Work Incentive Pro-
gram, many of whom are college students, will receive a smaller initial
clothing grant.

Also, all people receiving general assistance will be allowed to
earn a maximum of 50 per month before their grant will be reduced.

Even though state and federal regulations explicitly give welfare
clients the right to appeal, the memorandum from Mr. Gunderman
states, “A decrease or discontinuance regulating solely from the ap-
plication of these new regulations is not a basis for an appeal.”

The Welfare Rights Organization of Allegheny County feels that

“these charges effectively deny the needy the freedom of opportunity to

rise to each person’s individual merits. Rather than encouraging the
poor to help themselves to become self-supporting, the changes work to
keep them poor and undereducated. All people affected by these

   

changes who desire help should contact‘ Welfare Rights, phone number .

from, saying all this, and I
imagine he could see what I was
getting myself into, being so
damned liberal and all, but he
didn‘t say anything. We started
talking again, but about music,
and all the hassles of having long
hair, and we got back into pover-
ty and living in the ghetto almost
as if we couldn’t get away from
it.

He started telling me about
the ghetto, and a lot of things I
couldn’t really feel back when I
was ten years old, and I started
to feel not quite as liberal. We
kept talking because we were
feeling good, and maybe we
were both learning something,
until he say, “You see my people
never do it that way.”

Today, I don’t feel quite as

liberal or elated as I did last
night. My friend was balck and

200 years ago we couldn’t have
sat there and talked like that.

But it seems, that being there,

and talking isn't enou{3‘Wi
It’s hard to snuff out all traces
of racism, within yourself, when
everything within your society
has geared you towards it.

Black was no synonyms that
have good connotations, nor does
white have any that are bad. Two
hundred years ago, we took the
black man and created a myth
called the Negro. In another 200

years we may have destroyed ,

that myth, maybe.

A lot of things have happened
in the last ten years, and when
you think about them, you can al-
most -convince yourself that a
lot has changed, but when you
think about it a little more . . . .

  Factors Behind Student

Intercollegiate Press Service.

The type of higher education
institution which is most likely
to encounter student protests is
the large, urban university grant-
ing doctoral degrees, writes
Professor Harold Hodgkinson of
the University of California at
Berkeley in a recent issue of the
Teachers College Record.

Dr. Hodgkinson is profect di-
rector of the “Institutes in Tran-
sition” study, which is part of
the Carnegie Commission on
Higher Education under the
chairmanship of Clark Kerr. The
complete Institutes in Transi-
tion study will be released this
fall, but a preview was recently
given by Dr. Hodgkinson in an
article.

In his study, Dr. Hodgkinson
contacted the presidents of 1,230
colleges and universities
throughout the country to deter-
mine whether they had experi-
enced an increase in student
protests and demonstrations
during the past ten years.

Among the
these :

1. There is considerable evi-
dence from within the student
protest movement that issues
are often devised on the spot for
maximum effectiveness.

findings were

2. Colleges and universities
in regions with high levels of
population seem to have consi-
derably more student protests
than institutions in rural areas.
The states with the highest inci-
dence of student protest are New
York (50 per cent), Iowa (48 per
cent), Michigan (43 per cent).
Massachusetts (40 per cent)
California (36 per cent) and Illi-
nois (30 per cent).

“With the exception of Iowa
the high protest states tend to be
urban while the low protest
states tend to be more rural,"
Professor Hodgkinson notes.
The data provides some support
for the hypothesis that the cris-
is on campus is a parallel to the
crisis of the city.”

This does not mean, he ob-
serves, that protest occurs only
on campuses located in big cities
but that in some situations stu-
dents may be so close to a city
that the culture and conflict of
the city become a part of the
way they see their campus.

3. The universities which had

reported a high level of diversi-
ty in their student bodies, with
few local ties among the stu-
dents which might have served
as a deterrent to protest. Stu-
dents at these schools were us-
uall very active in community
volunteer programs and under-
ground student activities.

4. There seems to be a definite
relationship between the level
of degree awarded by the insti-
tution and the tendency toward
student protests. The higher the
degree awarded by an institu-
tion, the morelikely it is to have
student protests, the study
found. Of the institutions parti-
cipating in this study which
granted less than a B.A. degree,
24.8 per cent reported increased
student protests while 67.1 per

cent of the Ph.D. granting in-y

stitutions did.

5. Size of the institution was
cited as an even more reliable
indicator of student protest.

“At all degree levels, the in-
creased protest institutions are
larger than the institutions
which report no change in pro-

Protests Examined by Study

tests. Increasing size of stu-
dent body dramatically in-
creases the likelihood of in-
creased student protest," Dr.
Hodgkinson writes.

In a large institution protest
affords some students one of the
relatively few ways of being no-
ticed, Professor Hodgkinson
points out. In a large university,
“individuals are bound to feel
that they are part of a super sys-
tem and that they have little
power in relation to it.”

Student involvement in the
making of institutionalized poli-
cy is not the answer to the prob-
lem of student unrest, Dr.
Hodgkinson writes. Ironically,
student involvement -in institu-
tional policy making may actual-
ly lead to increased student pro-
test.

Instead he feels that efforts

will have to be made by the, »
larger institutions to provide a I

sense of concern and “selective
decentralization” is they are to
humanize their campuses and
remove some of the causes of
student protest.

Editor, The Pitt News:.

I am writing with regard to
Jack Simmons’ letter (The Pitt
News, November 6.). Simmons
deserves congratulations of sorts
for this particular letter. It is
obviously the work of an erudite
and intelligent mind.

In his first paragraph, Simmons
says that all non-radical and non-
liberal positions can be consider-
ed as having one thing in com-
mon, which makes them “a reas-
onably coherent and separate
alternative” to “radical-liberal-
ism.”

Thus, Simmons says, Agnew’s
use of the term “radic-lib” is
justified. One is tempted to ask
if Simmons really wishes to in-
clude all non-radical and non-

"liberal positions in his “reason-
;ably coherent and separate alter-
inative.” (Nazis, Fascists, Mon-
rchists, Tories, and the KuKlux
lan do seem a bit out of place
ten grouped with Nixon, no
atter how small that bit may be.

._,Let us examine Simmons’ “co-
erent anti-radic-lib” position
.nd see if it is followed by the
mainstream .of the so-called
emoderates and conservatives in
that is, Agnew,

of Congress.

To be explicit, the great dif-
ference that divides political
theories today can be described
in terms of the collectivist-indi-
vidualist dichotomy. Collectivism
is the belief that the collective
or the group is more important
than the individual. Individualism
is the converse. . . .Individual-
ists do not reject the value of
social relationships, nor do they
reject social obligations, but
they believe that these yhould
be voluntary. Collectivists reject
voluntarism and substitute for it
the full power of standard for
the good of the collective. Al-
though the difference might
sometimes be expressed in terms
of “supporting the president”
the ultimate difference is deep-
en/

The Pitt News, November 6

I interpret this statement as
saying that those who support
the President are individualists,
while those that do not are main-
ly collectivists. While I do recog-
nize the validity of thispolitical
division, (Karl Hess made a simi-
lar division in his article in
Playboy, “The Death of Politics,”
although he called individualism
“libertarianism.”) I do not

’ think that Nixon or any of his

followers are individualists by
any stretch of the imagination.

They are rather almost pure
collectivist with the tiniest drop
of ' individualist thrown in.

There are several examples of
the state sacrificing the rights
of individuals for the supposed
good of the collective which are
supported by the conservatives.
Wire-tapping and “no-knock”
laws both sacrifice the right of
the individual to privacy so that
the collective can be protected
from the unspeakable horror of
an individual smoking grass in
his own home.

There is the conservative op-
position to the Supreme Court’s
Miranda decision, which holds
the rights of the individual crim-
inal to be more important than
the collective’s desire to con-
vict him.

Also worth considering is Strom
Thurmond’s bill in the Senate to

“ permit the federal government to

intervene on college campuses
(this from a. man» who said that

“ :I2I2i:::=sr2-‘ Letters To The Editor 

Kesponsc:

 

   

Simmons Intelligent, But Wrong

federal enforcement of school
integration was unconstitutional.)

Simmons says thad int individual-
ists do not reject social obligation,
but believe these obligations
should be voluntary. How is it
possible for an obligation to be
voluntary? Where I come from,
voluntary and obligatory are
antonyms.

My last objection to Simmons’
letter is to the following sen-
tence: “Moreover, the moral rel-
ativism of contemporary liberal-
ism leads to moral paralysis,
which causes contemporary lib-
erals to tolerate, if not encour-
age, extremism.” The Pitt News,
November 6)

Liberals are not alone in their
toleration of extremism. Nixon’s
acceptance of an honorary hard-
hat, and his refusal to make any
statements condemning hardhat
violence, clearly shows this.

This facts lead me to believe
that people in this country today
have a tendency to defend the
extremist who acts out the hos-
tilities nearest to their heart,
and that Simmons’ “moral rela-
tivism” has no effect one way
or the other.

The problem is that the present
American political scene is far
too comples and irrational to be
divided in terms of adherence or
non-adherence to a single prin-
ciple, and that when one reaches
the extremes of either end of
the spectrum, principles make
very little difference in regard
to either belief or action.

Agnew did not coin the term
“radic-lib” because he was
struck by a similarity between
radicals and liberals that he
wished to share with other affic-
ionados of political science.

He coined the term so that he
could apply the tarbrush of his
bigoted rhetoric indiscriminately
to radical and liberal alike. He
knew full well that if he could
associate anyone who objected
to the no-knock provision with
bomb-throwing, pot-smoking radi-
cals by means of the word “radic-
lib”, he could conceivably make
it politically dangerous for any-
one in office to disagree with
the present administration.

Agnew basically wants to im-
ply that Charles Manson, Rennie
Davis, and Ramsey Clark are all
part of one massive conspiracy
and that all are equally danger-
ous and subversive, a simplifica-
tion strangely reminiscent of
Orwell’s 1984 (doesn’t the word
sound like Newspeak? Agnew
doubleplusgood duckspeak! )

It is the same principle that

Joseph McCarthy applied in the
early fifties, when anyone who
disagreed with loyalty oaths or
McCarthy’s investigative ex-
cesses could be‘ labeled a “fel-
low traveler” or “parlor pink”
and thus be considered every bit
as dangerous as a real full-blood-
ed Communist.

No Life Without Greeks

Dear Sir: Editor: The Pitt News:

In some recent articles and lttters in The Pitt News, the Greek 

system has come under fire. In response to these letters and

articles. perhaps it will be useful to pose some questions concerning  I

the Greeks at Pitt.

The Greek system needs the university in order to exist but does
the university need the Greek system’? How many fraternities and
sororities support community service projects? The answer, every
fraternity and sorority.

What percentage of the people who help to run the Freshman
orientation and mentor programs are Greek? How many Greeks are
involved in Student Government‘? How many Greeks help to organ-

ize Winter Weekend and Homecoming events‘? How many parties 

are sponsored by Greeks, often invaded by non-Greeks?

Yes. how many of Pitt’s social affairs are developed through’
the Greek system? If the social life at Pitt seems dismal, imagine if

what it would be like without the Greeks. Also, how much of an in-
tramural program would there be without the fraternities?

The Greeks at Pitt are changing and they are changing for the

better, for the betterment of the Greek system and for the better-“  f
ment of Pitt. Maybe if more paople became Greeks, life at Pitt »

would be better for everyone. Yes, the Greeks need Pitt, but Pitt
needs the Greeks. Joe Zucca,-em

However, at Penn State, he
began to yell to other teammates
midway through the race that
they «were goint to win. —

“I’ve been talking about beat-
ing them for a long time. I was
just so thrilled when I realized
that we were going to beat
them.”

Szabat is a late starter in run-
ning competition. He started to
compete in cross country for the
first time as a senior at Mt.
Lebanon high school. .

Since then, he has been con-
stantly improving, and con-
tinually enjoying it more.

“We were a three-loss team,”
Bemis said. “He said they just
weren’t going down to three-loss
teams unless they had to.”

Both Penn State and Penn could
be three-loss teams before their
season’s end this weekend, but
they are not the teams Bemis
would rule out of the playoffs.

“We all feel we’re one of the
better teams in our District,” he
explained. “But we don’t deny
Penn State. We feel we were bet-
ter than Delaware, even though
they were undefeated. And we
feel we’re better than Textile,
too. They don’t play anyone.” .

Being located at the western
end of District Two which ‘in-
cludes Delaware, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, Pitt teams might
have better chances at recogni-
tion if they could play rival Penn
State earlier in their seasons.

running just for the sake of it.
Actual competition is just one
aspect of it.”

“I believe that if you train
well, you are going to improve.
I never set any one particular
goal, because I think it would
hinder me.” .

Next week, Dave will be fac-
ing probably the biggest and
best field of runners in his
short career at the IC4A cham-
pionships in New York.

“It would be nice to finish in
the top 20 there, but I really
don’t want to set a goal.”

Szabat has a habit never to
look back at the ones behind me
while running, “I don’t want to
give them a feeling that I am
worried about them.” .

In his extensive readings about
cross country and track stars,
Dave has learned much about
their philosophies. “I just hope
that someday I might be able
to be in those same books,” he
concluded.

Volleyball
Girls Win

lst Game

by ELLEN GANLEY

The Pitt Women’s Volleyball
team brought home its first
victory of the season by down-
ing Chatham College on the
Pitt court on Monday at 4:30.
The home team took the contest
in two consecutive games 15-11
and 15-4.

Pitt’s captain Phyllis Wojie-
chowski won the toss and chose
to serve first. When the game
ball was thrown in at the start
of the game, Pitt took immediate
control and had Chatham play-
ing defensively throughout the
contest.

The home team was rolling
up the score until the middle
of the first match when Cha-
tham began to drive for the
lead. This drive was halted
when Pitt’s Cathy Utz spiked
the ball over the net, putting it
where none of the Chatham
players could handle it.

The second match was much
the same as the first, but in
this contest the Pitt girls never
gave the Chatham team a chance
to get going. The Chatham team
threw away its initial chance to
score when they drove their
first serve of the game into the
net. After this mistake, Chatham
saw very little of the ball ex-
cept as it came over the net for
Pitt points. .

The longest Chatham had pos-
session of the ball during the
second match was to score two
points at one time and this pos-

sible Chatham drive was halted ’

when Pitt‘s Rose Smith made
a base line dive to regain the
serve for the home team.

Pitt's starting line—up consist-
ed of Rose Smith. Cathy Utz,
Elaine Kingas, Phyllis Wojie-
chowski, Kathy Cassell, and
Jan Clouse. All girls played an
effective game with a number
of diving saves and some effec-
tive spiking.

After the varsity game, the
substitutes of both teams played
a scrimmage, game with the Pitt

team again pulling out a victory,

A

Afternoon

by JERRY MYERS .:.:.:

 

  

Dismal

A bold headline in the sports section of the Sunday New
York Times read, “Syracuse, Two Others Up For Bowl Bids.”
The article went to say that Syracuse, Air Force and Nebraska
will be in the running for election to a post-season classic
as of next Saturday, one week before their respective sea-

sons and on November 21.
The article failed to make

any mention of the Panthers,

which struck me as being somewhat ironical. It was only a
little over one week ago that bowl talk flodded Panther-town,
until the same Syracuse team that was heralded by the Times

put a wrench into the Pitt Season.

It was a brisk, overcast

afternoon in the New York

City when the Panthers put their winning streak, and in ef-
fect, their 1970 season on the line against a re-vitalized Or-

angemen squad. $a

The field was soggy, suffering from a week of inter-

mittent rain, and the oldest
concrete stadium in the country,
Archbold stadium, richly reflec-
ted its aura of antiquity with
damp, wooden benches‘ and cold
concrete slabs. .

As the afternoon transpired,
the Panthers and the weather
seemed to blend into one dis-
mal scene as the Cats saw their
hopes for an outstanding season
sink with each play-action pass

" llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllga

completed by the Orangemen quarterback, Randy Zur. When
was all over, Syracuse reigned supreme, with clear sailin,
ahead of them for the rest of the season, while the Panther:
hobbled home, battered with the prospect of facing Notre
Dame and Penn State in two of their final three contests.

Now with eight games behind the Panthers locked to
Boston College and Penn State, Notre Dame presented a
unique problem and the Panthers rose to the occasion with
spirit and pride. With six of their starting eleven defense-
men out for the contest, the Cats battled all the way, giving
Notre Dame one of the few scares of their slmost flawless
campaign late in the first half, taking the lead 14-13. $a

The dust has not settled yet. The corps of Panthers is
still critically depleted, a characteristic that has plagued
DePasqua and his Cats all season long. Forced to juggle his
line-up unceasingly, DePasqua has had a very tough time
fielding a smooth-running team. Certainly the conversion of
Phil Sgrignoli and Lou Julian to linebackers indicates how

severe the problem is. .

But pride must be the name of the game and the Pan-

thers appear to thrive on it.

Although they have failed as

yet to string together sixty solid minutes of football they have
time and time again risen to the challenge made by their

opponents.

After the Navy contest, some of the players indicated
that the squad plays just good enough to win. Their come-

" back victories over Baylor and West Virginia make this point

glaringly evident. The only letdown appears to be Syracuse,
and as the season enters its last two weeks this lapse becomes

very crucial.
Syracuse who began their

season with three losses has

now started to jell and will probably finish 7-3. With a good
performance against the high-flying Eagles of Boston College
and the resurgent Nitany Lions the Panthers also will finish
their season with seven wins and three losses, but apparently
the stakes are no longer the same.

by MIKE MILLER.

A stray soccer shoe was found
lying around the Field House
equipment room Monday. When
efforts at finding a mate proved
futile, the equipment manager
jokingly began a search for a
one legged soccer player.

He could have been looking
for Gary Midock. When Midock
persisted at playing his full back
position despite a serious knee
injury, his coach, Leo Bemis,
commented, “He’d play with one
leg if he had to.”

Fate turned against Midock,
in an informal soccer match this
summer when he first injured his,
knee. He compounded it in prac-
tice and then was hurt in a match
with Bucknell.

The repeated injury will neces-
sitate an operation after the sea-
son, but Gary feels that it will
be a minor one and hopes to con-
tinue with the sport. .

Midock has been playing soc-
cer since the seventh grade. He
played for Fox Chapel high
school and with the Harmar-
ville squad of the West-Penn
League. He supplemented soccer
with a short stint as a basket-
ball player and then tried his
hand at baseball.

He tried out with the Pitts-
burgh Pirates and the New York

Yankees when a senior in high H

school.

M idoclc Plays Soccer
With One Sound Leg

“I was the youngest guy there,”
he said, “They wanted things
like my draft standing and col-
lege status and I didn’t have
any. Inever heard from them.” .

A high school. soccer coach
was instrumental in talking him
out of a career in baseball and
increasing his desire to play
soccer.

He has played fullback for
most of his soccer career.

“I started out as a halfback
but I couldn't run enough. The
coach moved me back. That was
in the seventh grade.” .

The defensive position suits
him.

“I get ‘a good feeling out of
stopping offensive plays.”

I A Thursday, Niovernber I2,   

Though the offensive players
usually get more recognition,
Midock has no regrets.

“I never got much publicity
but it never bothered me. If I
feel I've played well I don't
care what anyone says.” .

He has been playing well for
Pitt. In the last match with West
Virginia he and his fellow full-
backs did their job well enough
to enable the goalie to standby
and admire their style of play.

Tonight Midock and the boot-
ers will host Harmarville in a

practice scrimmage. He is look--

ing forward to a match with his
old team mates.

“It’ll be a challenge. I’d just
like to beat them."

This is the third and last ad to be presented in this Series on the Issue of Responsibility. The first
two dealt with the Responsibility of the University of Pittsburgh and‘ of the School of General
Studies. This one will consider the Responsibility of the General Studies to himself.

Who are we, fellow night students? What are our motivations, our ambitions, our dreams?
Obviously, there is no simple answer to these questions because we -are individuals. We each
have our reason for being here; and yet, there is a common bond between us. If nothing else,
we all share the many problems inherent in the Night School problems here.

It is our responsibility, night students, to search for solutions for these problems. There are those
of you who feel that several hours of week in class is the maximum amount of time that you
can commit to the school. Believe me, the Student Cabinet Members understand and respect
this view. But, for those of you who hope to gain something more from your experience
here, now is the time to GET INVOLVED.

Your cabinet will present at our ”Open House” on November I8, our new proposed By-Laws.
These proposed By-Laws will eventually be circulated to the entire evening student body for
approval, -and if approved will become effective in the winter term. The major revision will
affect the area of membership. The By-Laws will call for a totally open membership with each
member indicating his particular -area of interest.

 

Let us share with you some of our goals for the future:
I.
2.

The production of a Complete, Informative Student Handbook.

The Development of a Course Evaluation Instrument which would give students an oppor-
tunity to rate the course content and the quality of instruction.

. The Installation of a Telephone-Answering Service which would be available at all times

f-or any night student with a question or a problem.

The The Establishment of Permanent Committees to deal with the following:

a) The Intolerable Parking Situation
b) The Scheduling of Classes and Programs

c) The Need for New Facilities in which night students could congregate and relax.
d) The Review and Reform of Curricula, Course Offerings, etc. ‘
)

e The Development of New Problems with an Emphasis on a Graduate Program at Night.

 

If you feel a responsibility to contribute time and effort, we certainly need the help. You can
begin by attending our ”Open House” on Wednesday, November I8, in the Supper Room of
the Student Union, any time between 7 and II:3O p.m. Come and have a coke or coffee with
us and let's discuss our school.
