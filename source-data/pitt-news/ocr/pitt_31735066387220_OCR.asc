Maher
selected
as new
provost

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

Chancellor J.‘ Dennis
O’Connor named Dr. James
Maher to the position of
senior vice chancellor and
provost of the university last
week.

Maher, currently chair of
Pitt’s department of physics
and astronomy, will assume
his new duties July 1.

“I’ve always seen myself
as a teacher and as a research
scientist,” Maher said, “and
it’s only in the past five
years, as we’ve seen so much
going on here and at other
universities, that I’ve gotten
interested in trying to have
an impact on the way the
university makes policy.”

The selection of Maher
culminates a 10-month
national search that involved
the review of 130 applica-
tions and nominations for the
position.

“Jim Maher has distin-
guished himself as an
enlightened member of the
Pitt family for 24 years,”
O’Connor said.

“He understands the uni-
versity’s diverse constituen-
cies, and he possesses a real-
istic grasp of the current state
of affairs in higher education
...,” O'Connor said. .

Maher has taught at Pit
since 1970 and has also
served as director of the
Scaife Nuclear Physics
Laboratory and as a fellow in
the Center for Philosophy of
Science and as a visiting sci-
entist.

About his promotion,
Maher said, “It is a large step
but I think it would be a large
step for anyone who hadn’t

already been a provost at a

Kemp challenges Pitt to prepare students

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Addressing administrators
and many of Pitt’s most inﬂu-
ential alumni, former Housing
and Urban Development
Secretary Jack Kemp chal-
lenged Pitt to prepare students
for “the most exciting age in
the history of mankind.”

“The question we must ask
ourselves is: Are we going to
prepare the minds, the hearts

and the talents of young men
and women to be ready for
this age of technology?”
Kemp said.

“This is 1776 all over again,
only this time a revolution is
taking place across the world.
We will be living in the age of
information and access.”

Kemp was in Pittsburgh

Thursday to speak to the Pitt

Ambassadors at their scholar-
ship dinner. The dinner was
held in honor of the two 1994

Pitt Ambassadors scholarship
winners, Melissa St. Onge of
Penn-Trafford High and Ryan
Russell of Slippery Rock
High.

In telling the scholarship
recipients how rapidly the
world was changing, Kemp
cited statistics that said acces-
sible information and comput-
er technology will double
every year of the students’
next four years at Pitt.

Assembly
votes to
conduct
survey

By John B. Moore

News Assistant

In an attempt to learn more
about rumored problems with
the dental school administra-
tion, Faculty Assembly voted
to conduct a survey to find
out the source of the prob-
lems.

A majority of the problems,
said School of Dental
Medicine Professor Thomas
Zullo, began with the
reorganization of the dental
school

“In October or November,
the annual faculty Opinions
and Perception survey was
disseminated to faculty in the
School of Dental Medicine,”
said Zullo.

Several results of this sur-
vey, which were sent to
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, the provost and
professors of the assembly,
were read at yesterday’s
meeting.

078 percent of the faculty
said they believe the institute
only supported faculty input
in decision-making to a limit-
ed extent, if at all.

-81 percent of the faculty
surveyed described the
administration style as totally
or almost totally autocratic.

In November 1993, a group
of dental school faculty met
to discuss their concerns with
alleged violations of the plan-
ning system in the reorganiza-
tion of the school.

In January 1994, the profes-
sor in charge of research
resigned from his post,
said Zullo, because of person-
nel decisions, accessibility
problems with the dean
and the issue of salary _incre-
ments.

News In Brief...

International

Vienna — North Korea told
the United States and its allies
that threat of sanctions could
not make it accept nuclear
inspections Monday.

After North Korea defied the
United Nations by blocking
nuclear inspections, triggering
the threat of further action,
Foreign Minister Kim Yong-
Nam said, “No sanctions, no
pressure will help solve the so-
called nuclear problem of

9 Korea.”

While the United States and
its allies discussed possible
solutions to the problem, the
board of the International
Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) met in Vienna only to
hear how its bid to make North
Korea keep its nuclear safe-
guard promises ended in fail-
ure. However, the IAEA
Director—General Hans Blix
made no mention of North
Korea in his keynote statement
at the week—1ong, closed-door
session in Vienna, apparently
waiting for an imminent reso-
lution by the U.N. Security
Council.

Blix was expected to give
the IAEA’s 35-member board
a detailed briefing later in the
proceedings, which could also
hear more from the North

Korean representative.

North Korea’s Committee
for the Peaceful Reunification
of the Fatherland said on
Monday sanctions would lead
to war. — Reuters

Student group promotes action

By Kathleen Scanlon
For The Pitt News

If members of the newly formed student group
Global Community Action can inspire one student
to write a letter to Congress, sophomore Hdeel
Abdelhady said her “head will be so big, they’ll
have to widen the sidewalks on campus.”

Abdelhady and graduate student Jennifer Nagel
formed Global Community Action this summer to
educate students about global issues and to
encourage students “to act on their knowledge.”

“We’re not the so-and-so group, we’re the action
group,” Abdelhady said. “I want to see some peo-
ple taking some initiative.”

The six members of Global Community Action,
in collaboration with Bosnian students at La
Roche College, have collected over 500 signatures
on a petition asking the United States to lift the
arms embargo on Bosnia. Two or three members
of the group will take the petition to Washington,
D.C. in July and meet with Sen. Bob Dole and a
Democratic senator.

Global Community Action wants the United
States to rally support from the European nations
for stronger international action in Bosnia,
Abdelhady said.

“With pressure, someone’s going to have to
act.”

Global Community Action wants to spur Pitt
students to apply some of that pressure on U.S.
leaders. The group will sponsor a presentation this
fall which will allow students to hear Bosnian
refugees describe life in a war zone, Abdelhady
said. The presentation will depict an accurate por-
trait of the devastation in Bosnia, she said, which
the media often distorts.

“Instead of saying ‘genocide,’ [media] use the
phrase ‘ethnic cleansing.’” The phrase is easier to
digest, but the problems not easy to digest.”

The group wants to dispel myths that Abdelhady
says blind students to reality.

“[Students], see little sound bites on TV but
don’t really know what’s going on,” she said. “If
they do know anything, it’s probably misleading.”

According to Abdelhady, many students think
the war in Bosnia is a civil war. Abdelhady said it
is not a civil war, because Bosnia declared inde-
pendence and the world acknowledged the coun-
try’s sovereignty. The war is then an aggression of
one state (Serbia), toward another (Bosnia), she
said.

Members of the group have distributed fact
sheets describing the history of the war and recent
military movements in Bosnia.

Global Community Action will also discuss
activist approaches to the situation in Haiti and the

UPMC budget cuts 35
WPIC staff members

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

Thirty—five Western
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic staff members
were told Thursday their
jobs were being elimi-
nated as part of a three-
year budget cutting
process.

“We intend to cut our
budget by 25 to 30 per-
cent in the next three
years,” said Jane Duffield,
a University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center
spokesperson.

Duffield said the cuts
were across the board,
including secretaries,
counselors, nurses and
administrators.

The employees mostly
were involved in outpa-

tient services and auxil-
iary inpatient services.

Last month, UPMC
eliminated 185 nurses in
the medical—surgica1
units from University
Presbyterian and
Montefiore hospitals.

Those nurses will be
eligible to apply for
100 new jobs that will
be created just as the lay-
offs go into effect in
December.

According to UPMC,
more than half of its oper-
ating costs are tied to
staffing expenses, salaries
and benefits.

UPMC says many of the
departments are being
restructured so as to elim-
inate vacant positions and
make the staff more effi-
cient.

civil war in Rwanda, Nagel said.

The group will sponsor events
to raise money for refugees and
it is considering bringing local
bands to campus for a fund-rais-
ing concert this fall, Nagel said.

Global Community Action
will attempt to reach Pitt stu-
dents who seem unconcerned
with global issues because of
busy school days or because
they feel they cannot do any-
thing to help people in faraway
places, Abdelhady said.

Students can do “little things”
like call or write Congress, send
letters to the White House or
write to the editor of a newspa-
per to voice their outrage or
pleasure with current govem-
mental policy, Abdelhady said.

Abdelhady said she hopes the
group will also help children liv-
ing in the inner city.

“Young kids who are growing

really have much choice in their
future,” she said. “They don’t
have a fair chance.”

The program would also alert
Pitt students to the problems that
confront inner-city children
every day, Abdelhady said.

“Drive through one of the
poor neighborhoods,” she said.
“Look at the numbers of how
many people are killed, are on
drugs  [and] drop out of
school. The number of people
dying is more than any war in
history and it’s happening right
here in a country where every-
thing is supposed to be peace-
ful.”

The group wants to do a lot
but may face financial con-
straints, she said, because the
group is limited now by its small
numbers and lack of experience.

Report  

°From page 1

school dance in the union’s Assembly Room.
Campus police broke up the ﬁght and evacuated
the students from the building, where they mixed
in with Pitt students. .

Among the Pitt students were members of
Pitt’s chapter of the National Society of Black
Engineers, who were waiting for a bus to an off-
carnpus bowling social.

In the confusion outside, campus and city
police reacted to the large group of students by
denying the students “movement,” causing the sit-
uation to become more unstable “due to the
unwillingness of some students to leave the area
as ordered,” according to the report, at which
point “verbal exchanges” between students and
police resulted. ‘

After the incident, The Pitt News reported on
April 4 that Pitt student Bryan Morrison and oth-
ers with him were harassed by a city ofﬁcer.
“There was no respect for human regard,”
Morrison told The Pitt News.

Six Pitt students were arrested by city police in
the melee but almost all of the charges were
dropped a few weeks later.

Carmen Stockton, one of the students on the
committee and president of the NSBE, said she

thought the whole process was successful even
though the city police were not involved exten-
sively.

“I’m not glad they didn’t come, but legally I
understand,” said Stockton.

“We were looking out for the next time with
this committee.”

Haley agreed the process was a preventative
measure for any future occurrences of this sort.

“[The committee] was formed not to look at the
incident and place blame on cops,” Stockton said.
“It was to look and prevent.”

Results of the committee’s investigation are in
the form of recommendations to the university
community and the city police, which Stockton
said she felt were the strongest thing the commit-
tee, which had no legal power could do .

The recommendations included:
0A request be forwarded to city police asking for
its own investigation of the union incident and
stronger sensitivity training.
°One campus police officer should be assigned to
serve as a liaison to the city police if there is a dis-
turbance involving both forces.
°There should be stronger sensitivity training for
police and a strong expression condemning the
use of “racist” language by police.

The Physics Department has
enough complexity to prepare
him, for the job, according to
Maher, because it is a labora-
tory science, has a big
research program with a com-
plicated federal grant structure
and it is also an academic
department with a fairly large
graduate program.

The provost is responsible
as the principal academic
officer for all the undergradu-
ate and graduate academic
degree granting pro-
grams offered at all the
Pitt campuses, the programs
and faculties of 11 schools
under the provost’s jurisdic-
tion, the university library

system, all non—medical
basic and applied research
and all academic support
units.

His interest in the job has
developed over the past five
years due to his concern over
the future of American univer-
sities, according to Maher.

“.I think American universi-
ties are all under severe eco-
nomic strain. They are also
under social strain,” Maher
said, referring to a hostility he
has noticed toward the univer-
sities from the media and
Congress.

“There are ample grounds
for worry about the way uni-
versities are going to be treat-
ed in this country in the
future,” Maher said.

Committee report not the end

The tragedy started two months ago at a dance sponsored by
Upward Bound. A fight that broke out at the event soured the
evening considerably, but what really left a stench on campus
was the manner in which police, both campus and city, handled
the situation.

The Special Committee on the William Pitt Union Incident has
submitted a special report concerning the incident for the view-
ing discretion of Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor.

This report, while commendable in its effort, is simply too
superficial to give the university hope that such an occurrence
will not happen again.

Further measures need to be taken.

The recommendations include:

Establishment of a liaison between university police and city
of Pittsburgh be implemented. .

°That a strong expression condemning the use of “racist” lan-
guage by police be registered, and training to increase sensitivity
be developed.

We can only insist that O’Connor take the report seriously and
implement the recommendations made to him, and that he mar-
shals every resource available to him and the university to make
sure something like this never happens again.

Only he has the power to do this.

In the event that such an unfortunate incident takes place
again, and the city police would be involved, they should be held
accountable for all of their actions.

The university community should not have to shrug its shoul-
ders every time something like this happens. 0

Don '1‘ Forget Russia

June 6, 1944: Russian troops battled the Germans on the
Eastern Front, while the remaining Allied powers took advantage
of Germany’s weak spot and dealt the blow that would lead to
the eventual fall of Nazi Germany.

June 6, 1994: Soldiers of the United States, Britain and Canada
strolled the beaches of Normandy as veterans of the historic
invasion,_reminiscing on the battle they took part in.

While most veterans and the rest of the world commemorate
D—Day with speeches, a reenactment of the paratroopers’ drop,
and the usual pomp and fanfare that surrounds these commemo-
rations, one vital partner of the invasion stands unjustly ignored
—— Russia. ‘

A recent poll that was conducted in the United States, Britain,
Germany and France to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied
landing revealed that 31 percent of Germans believed it was a
combination of the United States, Britain, and then Soviet Russia
that did the most damage to Nazi Germany.

The bloodshed of 20 million Russians stands as testimony to
the German recognition of the sacrifices, bravery and fortitude
that resulted in the depletion of the German army.

The rest of the world, however, has forgotten over the years
what Russia really meant to the Allied powers, specifically in
this case to the invasion of Normandy.

The nations involved in this event should have invited Russia’
to partake in the commemoration of D—Day. Without them there
would have been nothing to remember.

President Clinton announced
that Haitian refugees caught
by the U.S. Coast Guard
would not be returned to Haiti
until an immigration hearing
was held to determine their
status. Members of the ultra-

Democrats will retain their

blacks and Hispanics and will
never seriously reform wel-
fare.

It is an indisputable fact that
the overwhelming majority of
Haitians who ﬂee their home-
land are economic refugees,
which, according to U.S.
refugee laws, should automati-
cally disqualify them from
entering this country. If that
law is overlooked, the fact that
most of those Haitian refugees
speak no English and some
carry diseases, including
AIDS, should definitely dis-

ment of financial support from
a U.S. citizen because legal
immigrants are not entitled to
any governmental services for
two years from the day they
enter the U.S. (i.e., welfare,
food stamps, etc.).

I personally don’t feel that
the INS policy towards legal
immigrants is unreasonable —
on the contrary, I’ think that
they are quite reasonable.

However, what I do find
completely absurd is the fact
that there is a government-
backed double standard

economy, but it is also
undeniable that illegal
immigrants have a neg-
ative impact on our

black youths in the inner
cities; namely that inner—city
violence is caused by a lack of
opportunities to get decent-
paying jobs. If this is true (and
only part of it is) why does
this group, and most liberal
democrats in general, want to
admit the boat loads of Haitian
refugees that are sure to come
from Clinton’s new policy?
The answer is not that liberals
are more humane than conser-
vatives, it is that Democrats
routinely rely partly on wel-
fare recipients and those that
support social programs to win
elections.

Those Haitians can’t vote,
but this and other social-wel-
fare policies ensure that the

know this from first-hand
experience when I went
through the process with the
Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS)
to get my wife, who is a
Chinese national, a visa in the
summer of 1992.

INS requires three things
for all immigrants who legally

invariably will be unable to

Homelessness alarming

Whether you live
in a Kansas farm-
house or a shoe-

box apartment in
Meredith South Oakland,
McClure shelter symbolizes

safety and comfort. Shelter is, in fact,
as important to humans as food and
water. Unfortunately, the numbers of
those without shelter in the United
States continues to escalate atan
alarming rate.

Why are there so many homeless?
Two years ago there were roughly 3
million homeless people. Now even a
rough estimate is difficult to obtain
because the numbers have exploded.
The rising numbers are fed by unem-
ployment, declining income (two fac-
tors college seniors should be aware
of), lack of affordable housing, family
breakups and the deinstitutionalization
of state mental facilities. In short, a
single reason for the expansion of the
shelterless population doesn’t exist.

If you broke down the numbers of
homeless into categories,_ who would
you expect to find most represented?
Drunk fortysomethings?

Yes, the traditional wino continues to
thrive alongside the crackhead in
American cities. I won’t argue with
that. But by far the largest portion of
the United States’ homeless population

is represented by another group: chil- .

dren.

The number of kids in homeless
families is expanding faster than any
of the other categories of the homeless:
faster than battered women, the unem-
ployed, ex-cons, runaways, the mental-
ly ill, the elderly and immigrants.

In 1991, the Child Welfare League
estimated that more than one million
U.S. children were living in urban and
rural homeless families. Not only is
this an unfortunate reality, it’s cause
for alarm. But before you brand a
bleeding heart on my hide, read on.

Let’s focus on the children solely in

terms of our wallets, shall we? If these
kids don’t have homes,va considerable
number of them aren’t going to school.
(Mom and Dad can't exactly afford a
car at the moment and just where is an
addressless child supposed to catch a
school bus?) Assuming such a child is
receiving schooling, where would
he/she do homework?

Kids in homeless families can and

_do slip through society without receiv-

ing an education. Someone else will
pay down the road, whether it’s in the
form of welfare support, hospital
billing, or in the worst cases, jail and
legal fees.

What is to be done? I encourage you
to get involved because homelessness
has grown to such an extent that it is
now everyone’s problem. If, however,
you are like me and suffer from a con-
science whose twinging is ignored
when it comes to giving away money,
think about the larger sums that will be
missing from your future paychecks to
finance the lives of the uneducated,
illiterate and dependent adults that
homeless kids could become.

If you can spare a few dollars, some
canned goods, or some of your time
now, you’ll save yourself from a larger
bill later on.

As for that guy who asks me for a
quarter every Tuesday and Thursday as
I attempt to nonchalantly breeze past
him, hoping he won’t ask me for
money again — I don’t know if he
legitimately needs help or not. For this
reason, I advocate volunteering at or
donating to local agencies whose
employees know better. '

So far, this is the way I’ve been able
to reconcile my conscience with my
ever-present paranoia of being ripped
off. D .

In Pittsburgh there are several orga-
nizations and agencies who welcome
help and they’re listed under Human
Services in the white pages.

If you’re one of the phone bookless,
here are some suggestions: The
Salvation Army, The Jubilee Soup
Kitchen or Whale’s Tale.

Columnist 

_ ning through the
Rlck _ _ University of
Cardinal‘ Pittsburgh, is the

lifeline to the street beggars (or pan-
handlers) in the greater Oakland area.
The campus hangouts fall directly on
this main drag. These student gather-
ing-places are made up of a group of
bars, eateries, and shops; ideal ambush
points for panhandlers to pray on pass-
ing students. They stand holding cups,
shouting, “Change please?” When
passing with hands in pockets, con-
science often brings out a shiny trophy
in it. Is it conscience that lets that cur-
rency go? The sight of a grown adult,
standing all too often in the cold, wear-
ing their entire wardrobe on their per-
son, must hit a nerve somewhere
inside. Stopping to give a coin and dig-
gin’ through a tight jean pocket both
slow the process just enough to notice
the anguish on a face, the holes in the
tennis shoes worn by the salted side-
walk and possibly the rolled newspaper
that more than likely will serve as the
evening’s bedding. To finally make eye
contact is like looking into two pieces
of coal, darkened by a tale or story.
There has to be a story! _

In this world we live in today, people
do not want to hear stories about starv-
ing Third World nations, poverty-
strickencommunities, the homeless, or
anything else that shows a side of
depression.

People’s lives are depressed enough
with bills, payments, unemployment
and pregnancies to concern themselves
with the problems that appear on the
evening news or out of the mouth of
some bum talking about how he didn’t
get a fair shake at life. As busy college
students hustling to and from the class-
room, do we really have time for this?
Do we have the money to fund these
people? No! Of course not. The last

thing that a summer commuter needs_

to hear on his or her way to class is,
“Little help?” Why should I stop and
dig around in my pockets for change
that I probably will need later on in the
day or week for parking, or maybe bus
fare. Upon ending a tiring day at the
office, why ‘do I need to contend with
this harassment? In essence, that is
what this comes down to, simple
harassment. Just because the guy at the
local 7—Eleven opened the door for me
doesn’t mean that he is entitled to my
money. Since when did 7-Elevens pick
up door men on the payroll? Maybe it
might be a little more profitable if pan-
handlers were to get a real job; hell,
they are doing the same amount of
work opening and closing doors any-
way.

’ Oakland is a dying community. If it
wasn’t for the college campus Oakland
would have been dead years ago. Is it a
wonder that the area has atrophied?
Just look at the businesses on Forbes
Avenue. The whole street looks like a
slum. Panhandlers have roosted out-
side every business on the avenue,
deterring would—be customers. Isn’t
this loitering a crime? Maybe it should
be. Who wants to wade through a sea
of vagrants to get a workout at Forbes
Fitness Center or even a Coke at the 7-
Eleven, knowing full well that when
you come out you will be hounded for
change? People often use the avoid-
ance tactic to not have to exchange
words with the panhandler. A person
will actually cross the street and walk
on the other side to avoid passing the
person.

Hard-working people should not
have to throw table scraps to dregs
hitching rides on the tailgate of society.

This country was founded on hard
work and determination and this action
of non-working America is a virus rob-
bing us of our historical tradition of
being a capitalist—built economy, an
economy in which Americans work
their way up the social ladder and see
the horizon of success from the top
rung.

Letter states blacks should pursue power not justice

The article that appeared in the
Wednesday June 1 issue of the Pitt
News entitled “Do blacks want to end
Racism,” by Mr. Rick Nowlin was the
most ignorant and arrogant piece of
writing I’ve ever had the misfortune to
lay my eyes on.

The only thing I would honor con-
cerning his article is that fortunately it
is his opinion. Mr. Nowlin spoke of
racism being on an institutional level
and proclaimed Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr’s movement to be a valuable
cause. Both aspects I agree upon
wholeheartedly.

My concern lies with Mr. Nowlin’s
blurred perception of the black com-
munity not being able to “handle”
power and that we (blacks) need to
pursue justice rather than power. Well,
Mr. Nowlin, power comes from unity.
Unity being something the black race
has fought hard to obtain and hasn’t
successfully done due to the opposing
forces pulling at every hand, leg, arm,
and toe to prevent. For example, the
malicious death of Dr. Martin Luther

King. If the black race had the power
or pursued the power you so ignorantly
wrote of, the Rodney King beating
would have never occurred. The life of
Malice Green would have never been
taken. If black people had power we

merely living comes first.

Mr. Nowlin also degrades Reverend
Al Sharpton and the honorable Louis
Farrakhan; These men are leaders of
the black community in one way or
another, whether or not he agrees with
the views they hold and speak about or
not.

Why would Mr. Nowlin want to keep
these pertinent figures out of our lives
especially when they both preach a
form of hope for African Americans?

horizon

with What Black People
Should Do Now, by Ralph Wiley,
Airing Dirty Laundry, by Ishmael
Reed, Race Matters, by Comel West,
The Choice, by Samuel F. Yette and
Racism 101 by Nikki Giovanni.

Mr. Nowlin should try doing some
research on Reverend Al Sharpton and
the honorable Louis Farrakhan. From
this he will learn they merely want to
better the conditions of their race,
which is African American.

In order to further understand the
numerous struggles today’s black
youth encounter, he should sacrifice
some of his time to the Black Studies
department at the University of
Pittsburgh. He should try speaking
with some of the aspiring young, intel-
ligent minds that have to deal with
racism on a" daily basis. Listen to their
anger and then wonder why we strive
for power, not justice.

And finally Mr. Nowlin needs to
look up the word racism. One needs
power to be a racist, something the
black race does not posses.

Breaking down the barriers and
building positive relationships is exact-
ly what needs to be done, but criticiz-
ing the power the black community
pursues is not the way. I think Mr.
Nowlin needs to stop over at Hillman
Library or the Black Studies depart-
ment before he attempts to write anoth-
er article on racism.

Thirty Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould
Directed by Francois Girard
Written by Francois Girard
and Don McKellar

With Colm Feore

Too often the standard bio-
pic tries to squeeze someone’s
life into the th»ree—act
Hollywood drama that makes
for a clean story but a weak
representation of reality.

Thirty Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould works for
something more. Focusing its
energy in recreating singular
moments in the life of pianist
and eccentric Glenn Gould
(Colm Feore), the film dances
through a standard litany of the
development of a genius from
boyhood on, peppered with
documentary-like interviews in
which actors play Gould’s
family, friends and musician
colleagues.

So the lives of Glenn Gould
become filtered through this
collection of moments, framed
at the beginning and ending
with the subject wandering a
whitewashed, frozen landscape

in abject loneliness. Thirty Two
Short Films takes great pains
to paint Gould as a marginal
figure. He’s the first concert
pianist to shed the tuxedo in
favor of informal dress and
there’s even a few minutes on
his pill—popping ways, his love
for amphetamines and the like.

After these scenes, Gould
comes across as kind of a
candy—assed subversive, a bor-
ing genius whose innovations
reverberate only among a
small circle of folks. And
Gould is just the kind of char-
acter that haughty classical-
music circles might embrace
as a vaunted eccentric because
he poses little or no threat to
their middle—class sensibilities.

But whenever the film wan-
ders here there is always his
music. It's this single, undeni-
able element of his life that
comes through untainted. Most
of the film manages to allow
the man’s playing and compo-
sitions to be seen and heard in
a way that allows even the
unwashed to grasp at just why
Gould was considered such a
genius.

There is a final sense that

take notice, that his quirkiness
and genius called for an
unconventional approach to a

film about his life. By romanti-

slightly the achieved realism
remains mildly diluted. Thirty

Catwalk: Music From the TV Series
Catwalk
Atlantic

They’re all models, you know what I mean, and
they lip-sync their asses off on the Catwalk. God
bless MTV! If you’ve seen the riveting “Catwalk”
T.V. show, shout out a boisterous “Amen.” I don’t
know the exact plot. but I think it has something to
do with a struggling rock ‘n’ roll band. They prac-
tice, gig, fall in love, fight and play music ‘cause
that’s what is important, man. This may shock
some, but the actors on the series don’t play their
instruments, nor do they sing the songs. Oh well,
they’re pretty cute. I am not going to critique the
show, the ridiculous characters, the target audience,
or other similar shows that have failed miserably
(Yes, “Cop Rock” comes to mind.) Instead I have
the pleasure to discuss a compact disc that is chock
full 0’ Catwalk songs, as well as a few other sur-
prises.

A Catwalk CD?? I don’t know who pushed for
this, but they have some guts. It may seem like a
reasonable thing to do; people must tune into the
show. My question is why waste money putting out
a recording when most of the show’s viewers just
want to watch the guitar player’s butt, or the bass
player’s bosoms, and see everybody get tangled up
in melodramatic love triangles. NOBODY LIKES

THE MUSIC!! Do they?

First off, most of the songs are mid/up tempo
rock songs; there’s little variety. Second, the band
sounds like an ultra—s1ick Nashville act that proba-
bly backs up Lorie Morgan in their spare time.
Their sound must come from the new country tra-
dition. It shares the sterile, brittle, guitar tones, dull
bass, and big, simple drum sound. But unlike the
typical country outfit, this band is led by an over-
emotional whiner without an accent. They’re back-
up singers that probably needed work after Clapton
went unplugged. As much as the band is deriva-
tive, they don’t sound like anybody. I mean, they

sound bad, but they sound “Catwalk” bad. Why is
it that T.V. bands don’t sound like anybody else,
but they all sound like each other?

The first song, “If You Want Me,” starts, “I
swear you are wicked  you laugh when you’re
serious.” A funky bass slap leads into a chorus that
begs, “If you want me give me a sign/I’ll run to
you baby, I haven’t no pride.” I won’t preach about
double negatives, but I do have a question: Have
these guys been hanging out with Collective Soul‘?
“Life is Sweet” contains similar cheesiness. It
starts off slow and sort of rips off that “Knocking
on Heaven’s.Door” chord change. It mixes that
with a cliched soul segue into a chorus that gives
this writer some hope: “Life is sweet  If you let
me, I could help you see.” Its almost pointless to
discuss the rest of the songs, but one does stand
out. “You Hurt Me” is the cheesiest song on the
entire album. Let the lyrics speak for themselves:
“When the world was new I put my trust in you
like there was no tomorrow/ hey what did I know/
oh baby what did you do/ you hurt me.” You hear
this narrative and all you can think is “Don’t be a
chump, she’s gonna mess with your mind  she’s
gonna make a fool of you  she’s gonna, she’s
gonna hurt you!!!” I guess mistakes help you learn,
especially when it comes to love.

Lysistrata is Ancient
Greece’s version of the 1960s’
slogan, “Make Love, Not
War,” but it’s not exactly
Woodstock II.

The last song played before
curtain for Lysistrata is En
Vogue’s “Never Gonna Get It,”
and that pretty much sums up
the plot. The women of Greece

rally under the leadership of

Lysistrata (Maureen Collins)
to end the Peloponnesian war.
She claims the answer for
peace is that they call on all
the women from both sides of
the front to withold sex from
their lovers and husbands until
the fighting ends. The men
don’t believe this simple solu-
tion concocted by a woman
can work. Outraged, the
women struggle with their own
desires to prove them wrong.
Collins is the perfect
Lysistrata: a calculating leader
with a good sense of humor.
Ardene Effatt is powerful and
energetic as Lampito, leader of
the women of Sparta. She and
Collins really maintain a sense

actors simply stuffed their
sock drawers down their pants.
The musical selection was

 great, though. The audience

 
  
 

really reacted to songs like
“Respect” and “Sisters Are

 Doin’ It For Themselves”

 
 

ters. Myrrine (Angel Meyer)
and Kinesias (Jason Coyle) are
an especially tormented pair of
lovers that serve as an example
of what this sacrificial plan is
doing to the sex drives of
Greece.

It’s not the actors’ fault that
all the male roles were written
as basic characitures. All men
were presumed to be cowardly,
weak egotists. This was most
evident in the role of the com-
misioner, played to the hilt by
James Jaap. The actors were
given such original lines as ‘A
man must do what a man must
do.’ Even Rush Limbaugh
could have said it better.

The move to use modern
slang was one that involved
the audience, but the cliches
and abnormal use of puns
needed to be cleaned up
(“Wide World of Sports” in the
land of Olympus among
them). The attention to making
the costumes uniform wasn’t
there and proved distracting.
The many mock erections —
yes, you read it right the first
time —-— looked more like the

(which took on an entirely dif-
ferent meaning). The players
really got into the lyrics. Until
the curtain call, which was
hilarious, those were the
scenes they seemed to enjoy
the most.

that’s what summer theater is

Well, I said there were some
surprises on the album. Some
marketing genius decided that
the Catwalk songs were not
enough to sell the record. He
or she decided that there had
to be some hip appeal to the
CD so there are four songs
from other artists. “I’m
Allowed” by Buffalo Tom was
included and sticks out like a
sore thumb. It is a low—key
jangle rock song that has an
intro that’s reminiscent of that
U2 song “One.” It’s a pretty
decent song, builds to a cli-
max and then ends; no surpris-

like a marriage between the
“Catwalk” band and Buffalo
Tom. I didn’t like it; it leans
more towards the “Catwalk”
end of the scale. The band
Intro contributes “Ribbon in
the Sky,” a new school R ‘n’
B song that is as boring and
impotent as any other new
Motown band. Stevie Wonder
wrote the tune, but Intro can’t
even come close to his mas-
tery. The other band featured
is the Lemonheads. While
Evan Dando is probably cute
enough to be in Catwalk, even
his song seems out of place. It
is a catchy song called “It’s
About Time” which features
Juliana Hatfield on backing
vocals. The lyrics are equal

parts wit and sappy junk. I
personally get a kick when
Dando sings, “Enough about
us, lets talk about me!” These
and other songs are mixed in
with the Catwalk songs and
seem to be in no significant
order.

I have one fear. One day
these songs will be revamped
by some cool rock ‘n’ rollers
as some kind of joke. It will
be hip one day to state

“Catwalk” as an inﬂuence just '

as its hip to say you love the
Partridge Family. I doubt any-
one would want to be that
cool. At least I hope not.

A 1 blocked shots
Columnist against the
Keith Pompey Indiana
Pacers Monday night, the big
question is  will Patrick
Ewing ﬁnally get the ring he
predicted back on May 1?

On that day the centerpiece
of the Knicks was quoted in a
New York paper as saying,”We
will win it all.”

To do that, the bullies of
33rd street are tonight faced
with challenging the Western
Conference champion Houston
Rockets, tipping off a best-of-
seven NBA championship.

Considering the Rockets
swept the Knicks in the regular
season, Ewing will have to put
up or shut up. During the two
times these teams met, Ewing
was held to 12 points and nine
rebounds as well as 26 percent
shooting from the field.

Meanwhile, Ewing’s oppo-
nent terrorized the Knicks.

In those games, Hakeem
“The Dream” Olajuwon, the
league’s MVP, averaged 33
points, 16 rebounds and also
managed to shoot 53 percent
from the ﬁeld.

But according to Olajuwon
that was then and this is now.

“That’s the regular season,’
Olajuwon, also the defensive
player of the year, said. “This
is a regular ball game. There’s
a different mentality, a differ-
ent attitude. [Ewing] has pride.
He’s tough. He’ll come out
strong.”

Coming out strong is what
Ewing, an eight-time all-star,-
has been doing since the play-
offs began. Despite having one
lackluster performance (game
four against the Pacers when
he scored a career-low one
point) the Georgetown alum-
nus has been the go-to—guy for
the Knicks in the post-season
tournament.

Ewing’s best games came
when New York coach Pat
Riley stuck with him while he
was in foul trouble. For
instance, during game four
against the Nets, Ewing swat-

All-Americans
Blair, Fletcher andWi||iams earn high honors

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

Ninth in the nation. That is
what the University of

Pittsburgh women’s track and_

field team finished at last
week’s NCAA Championship
in Boise, Idaho.

L'ed by A1l—Americans
Najuma Fletcher, Allison
Williams and Kim Blair the
Lady Panthers scored 21 points
in the four-day competition
among the 69 teams vying for
the national crown.

But, like the previous year
Louisiana State ran away with
another title scoring 86 points.
The second place team was
Texas with 43 points.

Considering the fact that Pitt
was represented by only seven
athletes in the big dance, a
ninth place performance is as
good as it gets.

“As Tony the Tiger said  I
will say the same for Anthony
the Panther, G-r-r-r-e-a-t,” Pitt
Head Coach Steve Lewis said
of the team’s performance. “I
couldn’t go past 10 people
without people saying, ‘Your
women really performed well.’

“A few things happened in
the meet that only the team
members would know that
characterized their character.”

Those things were Fletcher’s
triple awards, Blair’s desire not
to give up on her dream and
Williams’ heart.

Fletcher, a sophomore from
Guyana, competed in the hep-
tathlon, triple jump and the
high jump earning All-
American status in all three.

“It was great, ecstatic, excit-
ed, honored, thrilled and all the
other good words that go with
the way I feel,” Fletcher said
about receiving three All-
American awards.

In the heptathlon, “Fletch”
outdueled Illinois’ Carmel
Corbett to give her an overall
third place finish with a com-
bined score of 5,750 points, a
new school record.

“The heptathlon was my best
event. I [broke my personal
record] by just about 300
points,” she said.

In her other two events,
Fletcher continued where she
left off. In the high jump she
placed third with her school
record tying height of 5-feet-
10.75 inches giving her yet
another All—American award
with a sixth place ﬁnish.

“Fletch” continued her
excellence by leaping 42-feet-

“I hurt the bottom of my
foot. [The medical staff] said it
was bad case of tendinitis,”
Blair said. “It was hurting real-
ly bad and if I would have run
the mile relay I might not have
been able to run in the finals of
the quarter hurdles the next
day. ,

“[The doctors] told me to

10.75 inches in the triple jump
placing her sixth. Good
enough for a third honor.

While Fletcher shined in
three different events, Blair
would not be denied in one.

After qualifying for the 400-
meter hurdles, the bottom of
Blair’s right foot became
inﬂamed while competing in
the l00—meter hurdles trials.
After an examination‘ with the
medical staff, she was not per-
mitted to compete for the rest
of the day, thus scratching her
from the 4 x 400 relay.

stay off my feet as much as
possible.”

While sitting in the stands
the team captain witnessed a
disaster. Pitt’s relay team com-
posed of Ayne Allen,
Williams, Lakeya Smith and
Angie Martin finished dead
last in the prelims with a time
of 3:47 seconds, 10 seconds
off their season best.

“I felt bad because I am one
of the best runners,” Blair said.
“I didn’t want to put the team
out there like that.”

Fletcher
attains
three tit/es

"By David Saliba

Staff Writer

The swift and agile feet of
Najuma Fletcher captured
three All—American titles at
last weekend’s NCAA Track
and Field Championships in
Boise, Idaho.

Fletcher, a native of
Guyana, has added these cre-
dentials to an already impres-
sive list which includes her
1992 Olympic appearance.
Her success at the NCAA
championships is only a step-
ping stone to a promising
future.

“I think that Najuma
Fletcher was the most dynam-
ic athlete in the meet, and that
is personal,” Pitt women’s
track coach Steve Lewis said.

“Being as objective as I can
in terms of her performance, I
would have to say, as a sopho-
more, it was an accumulation
of desire, endurance, strength,
dedication, and talent. It was
just excellent.”

In her second year at the
NCAA Championships
Fletcher finally won the All-
American status that she had
been vying for. '

After finishing third in the
heptathlon, she successfully
wound up in sixth place in
both the triple jump and the
high jump. The top eight in
each event earn All-American
honors.

“It was certainly a great
achievement for me since I
wasn’t able to get the All-
American status last year,”
Fletcher said. “It was the
crowning point of my season.”

Although the NCAAs were
very satisfying for her, it was
not as easy as one may think.
For Fletcher, the four-day
event was stretched to what
seemed to be a week.

Son follows father from Western Kentucky

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball program has secured
a layer of family atmosphere that Head
Coach Ralph Willard spoke of when he
was named to the position March 29.

“We had a family. That’s the one thing I
will instill here at Pitt,” Willard said at his
inaugural press conference.

And instill family he has, literally.

Coach Willard’s son Kevin is transfer-
ring to Pitt from Western Kentucky so he
can play basketball once again for his dad.

Willard, a 6 foot 170 pound point guard,
decided to follow his father to Pittsburgh

last week because he wanted to be close to
his family. _ -

“The [Willard’s] are a tight-knit family,”
Pitt assistant coach Tom Crean said. “I
think the overriding factor was that
[Kevin] wanted to be near his family.”

Willard, who will sit out this season and
have three years of eligibility remaining in
1995-96, averaged 4.6 points and close to
two assists per game last year for Western
Kentucky. He also made 65 percent of his
three-point field goals.

In some of his better games last year,
Willard scored 16 points against New
Orleans and registered 18 points and six
assists against South Western Louisiana in

the Sun Belt Championship game.

Willard, a walk-on at Western
Kentucky, left an opportunity for a start-
mg position to come to Pitt.

“It’s a great situation for him here,”
Crean said.

“He’s good enough to compete at this
level. He proved that last year as a signifi-
cant contributor to an NCAA tournament
team.

“He’s a very good point guard. He’s
tough, aggressive, sees the ﬂoor very well
and he is a leader,” Crean said.

“[Kevin] does whatever it takes to first

of all win and second to improve him-
self.”

plays  
percentages

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

If Mark Jackson was a bet-
ting man, it would not pay to
bet against him. Because the
odds of beating him’ do not
favor anyone who tries.

“After coaching over years
and years, it’s no different than
playing cards,” the Pitt head
baseball coach said. “It’s all
based on percentages —
what’s going to work the
majority of the time.”

And what Jackson does the
majority of the time is win.

He came to Pitt after amass-
ing 291 wins against only 53
losses in nine years at Point
Park College. And in his four
years at Pitt he has taken the
Panthers from 15 wins in
1991, to a school record 31
this season.

“I think I know the ingredi-
ents to be successful in base-
ball,” Jackson said. “A lot of
college coaches don’t realize
that there are a lot of X3 and
Os involved in this game.”

Jackson coaches what he
calls “situational baseball.”

“The heptathlon took two
days in which I performed in
seven different events,”
Fletcher said. “Those two
days seemed to go on forev-
er.”

Lewis said, in terms of
competition, the two days of
the heptathlon were grueling
for Fletcher.

“I was happy with my
results,” Fletcher said. “My

 

goal though is to get 6,000
points.” A goal that she will
now set for next year.

A highly anticipated event,
the heptathlon is synonymous
with the likes of Jackie

event that requires the athlete
to be quite versatile. The hep-

fatigue made the already
weary body of Fletcher that
much more battered.

“I was definitely worn out
by the time the high jump
came,” Fletcher said. “The
heptathlon was very drain-
ing.”

“[Based on] the fact that
this was the most hyped and
intense track meet for any col-
legiate of the year, just to
compete was something,”
Lewis said.

“To put all of that together
and come back the last day
and compete at the level that
she did in the high jump, that
was phenomenal.”

The progress of Fletcher as
an athlete as well as a person
is in part due to her accep-
tance of responsibility on and
off of the track.

In a team that Lewis calls a
“family,” Fletcher is the little
sister. »

the highest from the team,”
Lewis said. “Najuma has per-

not surprising to them and in
many cases it is almost
expected.”

As for Fletcher, her
Olympic background is not
something that she found her-
self depending upon in the
NCAAs

“The competitions are total-
ly different,” Fletcher said.
“My appearance at the
NCAAs last year helped me
out at this year’s event.”

The label of “Olympian”
seems to be cast upon
Fletcher every time her name
is mentioned. A prestigious
title that may be worn as a
banner by some is seen as
only an accomplishment by
Fletcher.

“It was a great experience
and an honor,” Fletcher said.

The success of athletes such
as Fletcher often leads to the
inevitable question of whether
the level of their success can
be raised.

Coach Lewis seems to think
that it is not even a question
to be dealt with.

“Overall her performance at
the NCAAs was just a peek
into the future of the possibili-
ties of Pitt having one of the
most dynamic female athletes
in the country,” Lewis said.

All-Americans

‘From page 12

After taking a day of watch-
ing her teammates fail to make
the mile relay finals, Blair was
eager to hit the track.

On that day she wouldn’t let
her feet or anything else stop
her from obtaining her season
long goal. She hobbled across
the finish line with a time of
57.47 seconds. Looking
around Blair discovered she
took third place behind
Louisiana State’s Debbie
Anne» Parris (56.60) and
UCLA’s Keisha Marvin
(56.62) making her a career
two—time All—American in that
event

“She ran the fastest time of
her career, set a new school
record and ultimately an All-
American,” Lewis said of his
team captain. ’

Williams, the greatest female
hurdler in Pitt history, did not
obtain her goal of winning the
national championship due to a
setback.

“In warming up for the finals
of the lO0—meter hurdles,
Allison pulled a hamstring,”
Lewis said. “Nobody knew it.
In the process Allison ran any-
way. Up until the eighth hurdle
Allison was clearly second.”

As Williams muscled her

points for her teammates.

While Fletcher, Blair and
Williams felt the thrill of
becoming All-Americans,
Martin felt what it was like
being a freshman in the
NCAA’s.

Competing in the 400—meter
hurdles as a favorite to make
the finals, Williams finished
the prelims eighth in her heat.
Her time of 1:03.12 crushed

was through the tape she had
slipped to sixth. The victory
went to Miami’s Gillian
Russell making her a three-
time national champ in the
hurdles.

Despite running her slowest
time of the year, Williams had
run fast enough to become a
career three-time All-
American. But most impor-
tantly she had scored valuable

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 8, 1994

Jackson

0 From page 13
clubs do things when the per-
centages are in their favor.
And one of the things that his
clubs do is steal bases.

Pitt won the NCAA stolen-
base title last year and set a
conference record with 88
steals in 21 Big East games
this season.

“It’s not like we get a guy on
first and just try to steal sec-
ond,” he said.

“We try to steal on an off-
speed pitch. We try when its
most advantageous for us be
successful.”

The Panthers were success-
ful 78 percent of the time
when they tried stealing in
1993’s 30—win season, and
upped that to 80 percent this
year. It’s all a numbers game to
Jackson, right?

Wrong.

While it may seem that
Jackson takes a calculated
approach to the game, it might
be his manipulation of the
intangibles that has turned the

program around.

Jackson says that when he
got here the Pitt players were
embarrassed by Trees Field, a
subpar division I facility. So he
knew he had to make changes
to try and make the field
advantageous to his club.

First he put in an all-grass
infield, conducive to stealing
bases and bunting for hits,
something the Panthers like to
do. And for another reason:

“When I was at Point Park
we went to Kentucky and
played on grass infie1ds,” he
said. “My infielders had a real
hard time knowing where to
play and adjusting to the
hops.”

Then he moved his club
from their traditional third
base dugout over to the first
base side. And he put
the bleachers behind home
plate, near the third
base dugout, leaving Pitt’s
opponents to deal with the
fans. And finally he lets
his players play the music

said. “We don’t have the best
field in the league, but our
players take pride in it and it
works to our advantage now.”

But don’t think that Jackson
is ready to sit back and revel in
his team’s accomplishments.
He is a modest man who
diverts credit away from him-
self.

“The last two years have
really been having the right
players in the program,” he
said.

And even though he shys
away from singling out play-
ers, Jackson credits junior col-
lege transfer Danny Gonzalez
for much of the Pitt baseball
team’s success.

“I brought him in for leader-
ship,” Jackson says.

“And for two years he was
there for every pitch. He’s the
type of player that makes a
program. He might be the
main reason for our success,
because the other guys really
caught his enthusiasm and atti-
tude.”

The Panthers made the Big
East playoffs for the first time
ever this season after winning
their first regular—season title.
Gonzalez, Scott Etsell, Josh
Tyler, Craig Crawley, Gregg
Mrochko, and the rest of the
Pitt players had everything to
do with that, but don’t bet that
Mark Jackson wasn’t a key
ingredient.

ted four shots after picking up
his ﬁfth foul.

Also on Sunday, Riley kept
Ewing in after he picked up
his fourth in the third quarter.
Later it proved to be a great
coaching decision, due in part

’ to Ewing’s game winning

rebound dunk with 26 seconds
left in regulation.

After that game Riley had
this to say:

“If there’s ever been a time
when a great player takes a
team on his back and finishes
a game off with a dunk, this is
it,” Riley said.

“Patrick did it. He took us
were he wanted us to be.”

Ewing added this about his
fourth quarter heroics.

“We were working for
the jump shot,” he said. “I
told Coach, ‘Forget all
that stuff, and give me the ball.
If we’re going to lose let me
lose it.”’

Tonight, Ewing will have the
same attitude. So when the
two-time Olympic gold medal-
ist lines up against Olajuw
on for the third time this
season, don’t think about the
two regular season matchups!

Think about his career stats
against Olujawon (21.9 points
and 9.4 rebounds).

As he runs out for the
pregame introductions, one
will see a hungry look on the
face of one of the greatest cen-
ters to ever play the game.

Take what Ewing said on
May I seriously. The Knicks
will winiit all and Ewing will
be the series MVP.

tant sports editor for The Pitt
News.
