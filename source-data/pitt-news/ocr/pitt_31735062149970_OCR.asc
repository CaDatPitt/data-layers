Burnett in Foster

Developing the theme “The
Sclf—Ed11cation of the VVriter——
Perhaps,” Whit Burnett‘, editor
of “Story” inagazine, will speak
at Foster Memorial Friday at 1 :30
o’clock.

Burnett, who has discovered many
of the latest short story writers, is
teaching a course in short story writ-
ing at Columbia at the present.

Author of a book of personal remi-
iniscences entitled “The Literary
Life—And the Hell With It,” Burnett
has also written a volume of short
stories and many reviews. He stud-
ied at the University of Southern
California and did graduate work at
the University of California.

According to Burnett, “Story” was

started as a mimeographed sheet in
Vienna and was introduced to this

country in 1933 as a story monthly“
He also established the Paris division"

of the New York Herald-‘Tribune.
Devoted entirely to short stories,

“Story” is one of ‘the best contempor-

ary magazines of its type in the

_ United States. It has the highest rep-

resentation of stcrries in =O’Brien’.s
“Best American ‘Short ‘Stories."’

The story ‘“‘.Ad;d:n.ess Unknown” by
Kressman Taylor which   re-
printed widely, was ﬁrst printed in
“Story.”

IF Hop Leader
Bills Last. Dance

Concluding this ycar’s series of
house dances for all fraternity men,
Interfraternity Council will sponsor
its third progressive dance on Satur-
day, May 20, according to Albert J.
Eger, BA40, committee chairman.

Eger announced that the following
houses would be hosts for the eve-
ning: Phi Kappa, 200 S. Craig street;
Phi Gamma Delta, 4725 Wallingford
street; Phi Epsilon Pi, 435 Neville
street; and Delta Tau Delta, 4712
Bayard street.

The progressive dances were orig-
inated by Interfraternity Council
last year as a means of promoting
friendship and goodwill among fra-
ternity men.

Hosts for this ﬁnal dance will at-
tempt to outdo hosts of the ﬁrst and
second dances in arranging novel en-
tertainment and decorations for this
informal spring dance.

F or Refugee Aid Fund

Campus Groups
Will Get Letters

From Committee

Letters to 42 campus organizations
are being mailed this week by the
University Committee to Aid Student
Refugees; announces Bernard Cash-
dollar, BA39, student chairman.

Soliciting contributions for living
expenses of two student refugees, this
latest campaign sponsored by the
combined student—faculty committee
is an effort to supplement an offer
made by the University administra-
tion to donate two scholarships.

According to stipulations attached
to the scholarships, living expenses
of the two recipients must first be
raised by the committee before the
award will be made.

“The cooperation of every student
is necessary if we are to succeed in
this humanitarian enterprise,” de-
clares Cashdollar.

Assisting in the. direction of the
faculty drive is Dr. Francis D. Tyson,
professor of economics.

Plans are being formed by the
committee to have a Tag Day down-
town, in order to contact the general
public and those persons not closely
associated with campus organizations,
according to Cashdollar.

Plans to bring on campus different
radio and movie stars apparently will
not materialize, according to commit-
tee spokesmen. Telegrams have been
received by the University committee
from Edgar Bergen, Al Jolson, and
Eddie Cantor announcing regrets that
they will be unable to participate in
the campus drive in person, but
“wishing full success for this noble
campaign.”

Students Ask
Deans to Ease

Study Program.
/Deans of the schools within the
University have been asked by
the Spring Festival committee to
!request their instructors to out

i

down on the Work assigned dur-
iing Spring Festival week, May 38
to 13.

This request, unusual since it was

sent by students to the deans, has
‘been received by all deans of the un-
dergraduate schools and several have
acceded to the proposition set forth
‘by Edwin Ellis, C39, Spring Festival
lchairman.

Dean Charles S. Tippetts of the
School of Business Administration,
and Frank W. Schockley, acting dean
of the School of Education, stated
that they have circulated the letter
among the faculty members in their
schools. '

Dean Stanton C. Crawford of the
College said that the unusual request
was referred to Dr. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, dean of men, and that no reply
has as yet been received from him.

As Dean I-Iolbrook of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines is out of
the city, no reply has been received
from him in regard to Ellis’ letter.
His oiiice reported, however, that a
meeting of the heads of all depart-
ments would be called before any de-
cision could be reached.

Spring Festival is longer this year
than in former years, and the request
was made to enable students to enjoy
the extra activities offered without
injuring their scholastic records.

Practice Teaching

All students in education inter-
ested in practice teaching for first

are requested to attend. a. meeting

Tests for T-B

Final preliminary tuberculin tests
for men students this week will be
egiven in the Falk Clinic, from 10 to 4
o’clock today, according to the sched-
ule of Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
the men’s health service.

Today through Friday, secondary
tests will also be administered to
those students who have a positive
reaction on the preliminary tests
given the ﬁrst three days of the week.

,‘This same half—and-half procedure
.will be continued through next week.

' Students in the School of Educa-
tion and all University athletes are
especially urged to take the tuber-
culin test. Special arrangements
and accomodations have been made
so that such students may take the
test at their convenience during
the remainder of the campaign, ac-
cording to Dr. Carlson.

Following the two—week test pe-
riod X-ray examinations will be
given to students who react positively
on both preliminary tests. A nega-
tive reaction to the second test, how-
ever, proves isolation from the tu-
berculin bacillus.

Dr. Carlson advises all who showed
positive on last year’s tuberculin tests
not to take the test again.

The tuberculin tests are a part of
the second group of health campaigns
—-the first, an anti-syphilis campaign
conducted last month—staged on
campus under the sponsorship of the
University health services and The

Professors Suggest Sly ii/days
To ifeud Pitt News Baring Ciuss

Keep it subtle, students, keep it
subtl.e—is the only advice professors
have for students who read The Pitt
News in class.

The News, swamped by professors’
charges that the paper is read in
class, decided that since the practice

 widespread, it should at least be

ldone with ﬁnesse, with artistry, and
E with cleverness. To discover the
best method, an unscientific poll of
faculty opinion was taken.

Though they disapprove of such
obvious methods as slipping the pa-
PCT under a notebook, or hiding it
under an‘ elbow, the instructors are
always ready to commend originality,
»c<':or-ding to faculty spokesmen.

J. Stewart Hunter, instructor in
'F.n9;lish, suggests a novel plan: “To
.prepare for reading The Pitt News in
ciass, the student should ﬁrst sit
ricwn in the Tuck Shop, clip the
items into convenient sizes, and paste
them in his notebook. Then, during
class. he can read the articles undis-
turbed. If he underlines sections, it
will appear as though he is taking
notes.”

“Fold the paper neatly and courte-
ously, as though you were in a street-

V

car,” advises Edwin L. Peterson, as-
sistant professor of English. Stand-
ing up in the middle of the class to
turn to an inside page is a highly ob-
jectionable action. Don’t.”

Mr. Peterson also dislikes to see a
student lean over the shoulder of the
person in front of him, to read The
News. “By all means, get your
own.”

In Robert X. Graham’s journalism
course, The News can easily be hidden
inside the pages of the daily papers
which the students consider in class.
“If I ﬁnd too many people reading
The News,” Graham explains, “we
start to discuss it. That makes it of-
ﬁcial.”

The opinion of the faculty tends to
em:-r:,-urage the spirit of inquiry-——even
if it in:_1uires into undercover liter-
aturc.

Though it was originally intended
to make the poll as comprehensive as
possible, too many professors answer-
ed the question with unintelligible
grunts, with quotations from the
Scriptures, with mathematical form-

ulae, and with revelations, “The
News? The News? Never heard
of it.”

Alumni Trustee Poll

Students to Submit
Course Selections
For Registration

Course selection cards for stu-
dents in the College must be ﬁlled
out before May 11, according to an
announcement from the office of
the dean.

Students whose names begin with
the letters “A” to “R” are instruct-
ed to obtain their cards from the
ofﬁce of their respective major de-
partments before 3:30 o’clock Fri-
day. All others will report between
May 8 and 11.

Dean Stanton C. Crawford advises
all students to have their cards
ﬁlled out even though plans for
registration are indeﬁnite, as no
student will be permitted to regis-
ter without his schedule.

Consultations with faculty advi-
sors are encouraged where the stu-
dent is undecided about his courses.
A copy of the blue print and tenta-

tive schedule should be brought to
these conferences.

Faculty Will Aid
Family Institute

Four members of the University
faculty are among the representa-
tives of 35 educational and civic
groups sponsoring a one-day Institute
of “Education For Family Living” to
be held Saturday, May 6, at Penn-
sylvania College for Women.

Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
and F. W. Shockley, director of the
University extension division are
amongthose sponsoring the institute.

There will be special discussion
groups for college and university
students from 2 until 4 o’clock.
Leading these groups will be Dr.
Max Schoen of Carnegie Tech whose
topic is, “Making a Success of Mar-
riage.” Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, di-
rector of women’s health service,
will have a similar subject.

Special sessions will also be held
for high school and pre-college stu-
dents under the direction of Dr. Jam-
ison.

The one-day institute will con-
clude with a general session under
the direction of Dr. Gerald D. Whit-
ney, lecturer in education.

Primary aim of the institute is to
outline practical methods for helping
the fathers and mothers of the Pitts-
burgh area “to help them become
better parents.”

The institute is open to the public,
with no admission charge.

i795 Members

Vote in Annual
Board Contest

By Edgar Beigel

Results of balloting by 1795
members of the General Alumni
Association reveal that Norman
MacLeod, BA17, and Floyd Rose,
E11, have been chosen to repre-
sent the Alumni on the University
Board of Trustees, according to a re-

lease issued late yesterday by Earl
Crawford, president of the Associa-
tion.

Mr. MacLeod, renamed for he
second consecutive term, and Mr.
Rose defeated Herbert N. Riley, C12,
and Ira R. Hill, BA24, all four of
whom were named by the executive
committee of the Association last
month as candidates for the two terms
which will expire July 1.
“TRUSTEES ELECT

Representing the sentiment of the
Alumni Association, MacLeod’s and
Rose’s names will be submitted to the
Board of Trustees, at their June
meeting. Following complete assent
by the Board, the two candidates will
then be formally elected into the
group. However, the Board has the
privilege to discard the names of any
candidates submitted to it.

Reason for this election is the ex-
piration of the three-year terms of
Mr. MacLeod and Wilbur D. Hocken-
smith, E01, the ﬁrst alumni-trustees
of the University, operating under a
plan instituted in 1936, following an
agreement between Chancellor John
G. Bowman and the Alumni Associa-

tion. This plan provided for six
alumni-trustees, two to be elected
each year.

NEW PLAN _

In 1937, that plan was superseded
by another, giving the Alumni 15
trustees. At that time there were
three vacancies on the Board, and on
the following July 1 (1937) the three-
year terms of ten members were to
expire. The Association’s member-
ship re-elected all 13 trustees.

This month’s election will ﬁll the
two original seats provided for un-
der the plan of 1936.

Mr. MacLeod is vice—president of
Ketchum, MacLeod and Grove, Pitts-
burgh advertising agency, and of
Ketchum, Inc., institutional ﬁnance
and public relations counselors.

Mr. Rose is vice-president of the
Vanadium Illinois Steel Company,
the Colonial Steel Company, and the
Anchor Drawn Steel Company, and
a director of the Vascoloy-Itamet
Corporation of North Chicago.

Brown Accounts
For Best Points

In Girl Review

By Bob Brown

I have about eight inches to talk
about the annual Cap and Gown
show, which opened Monday night at
the Nixon, and I am not going to
waste space with wordy superlatives.
It is enough to say that “At Your
Service” is the best show the Club
has put on in years. It is swell.

‘he reasons . . .

(1) G. Norman Reis has pulled
away from the old bugaboo of college
reviews in writing a script that is
fast, is funny, and gives the large cast
a plot that hardly ever keeps the au-
dience tying loose strings of the plot
together. He has all the answers,
and everybody likes it.

(2) The group was rehearsed and
trained well. There were no disturb-
ing halts while the actors mouthed
lines, the lighting system went on the
blink, the orchestra missed cues, etc,
etc. The thing went off like clock-
work.

(3) The characters were adapted
to their roles. I can’t list them all,
but some deserve especial mention.
Milt Hoffman had another .’r.:efty role
in the palpitating Mrs. Plumpton;
Karl Stark’s voice is the most beau-
tiful rasp that ever ﬂoated up into a

IVIONDAY, IVIAY, 1, 1939

. Edito1°’s Diary

N OUR last issue of The News we published the
- results of the recent poll taken by the “Colle-
giate Bureau of Research,” which asked a lot of
rather intima.te questions regarding this paper.
Students, asked all manner of things ranging from
which features they read to whether they mail
copies of The News home to friends, responded

' nobly, and The News presented the usual cold,

hard statistics.
But we of the embryo Fourth Estate have a

. queer habit of refusing to be satisﬁed with even

cold hard facts. So we thought, and we analyzed,
and we came out,
strangely enough, with a deﬁnite interpretation of
the student attitude to this newspaper. But be-
fore we go into that let’s write a little

Preface . . .

which may help to make the rest of this piece clear.
There are, to begin with, at least two schools of

V thought on the matter of what shall be the function.

'-of a college newspaper. There are those who hold
that the paper should be little more than a glori-
ﬁed campus bulletin board. ’l‘he college press, they
insist, should concentrate on printing every obvi-
ous publicity blurb which readers are so kind to
bring to the desk of the editor, to the exclusion of
vital and readable news and feature stories. U lldcr
this set—up, the editorial page is a sallow blotch of
ink which is maintained in expurgatcd form for
the sake of appearances.

The opposite group of theorists maintains tliat

_ college editors should be aware of the fact that out-

side the boundaries of the campus, there are actu-
ally other people, inferior though they may be,
who work and play and ﬁght and make history.
Thus, at the expense of an eight-inch story on
the Thursday afternoon poetry and goldﬁsh-swal-
lowing society, or a front-page streamer headline

' about the revolutionary “no corsage” policy adopt-

ed for University dances, the members of this
school of thought might be tempted to interview
students as to how they felt on the matter of peace
and war, or to print some news on campus affairs
which might shock some complacencies. This same
school of thought reserves the right to make free
and uncensored editorial comment on both local
and outside considerations, and to open its columns
to student expression on affairs of current interest.

We, as you must have guessed, admit member-

ship in the second school, although, because of
.practical. considerations, we are forced to cut
classes occasionally. .VVe were therefore, almost

overjoyed to learn, from the survey, that this
school has many more students enrolled than we
even dared to suspect.

For Example . . .

about half of the 1091 students returning the ques-
tionnaires favor the same amount of editorials

which The News has been running this year. Twen-
ty-seven per cent (obviously dangerous radicals)
think we should write more editorials, while 23.9
per cent would like us to quiet down a. little.

Even more encouraging is the tremendous vote
in favor of running “columns” in the paper. Fifty-
one per cent favored the same number, 41.9 per
cent favored MORE, and only 19.1 thought that
we were printing too many columns.

All of which seems quite obviously to indicate
that most Pitt students agree that their newspaper
should deﬁnitely continue to devote space to coni-
ment, however immature, not only on local Uni-
versity news and problems,-but also on social and
economic and political matters which, after all,
are very close tied in with the lives of University
students, especially those living in a metropolitan
university, and going to classes in a skyscraper
schoolhouse.

For it does seem logical that students, who rep-
resent a group which will have to take active lead-
ership in a muddled and confused world, should
have opportunity to think and to express them-
selves on these issues which are confusing and
niuddling what‘ we like to call the civilized world.
Of course

We Were a Little Disappointed . . .'

to discover that Pittpourni ranked ﬁrst among the
features. But really, it seems quite natural that :31
youthful. student’ body should be interested to learn
who Sadie Plotz was out with last night, and who
has hung a pin on whom . . . that they also like to
think about more serious things is reflected in the
seconcl-ranking of Brown Study, and the high rat'-
ing of other similar features.

We were interested to notice that they want
more news and pictures. So do we. “We realize
that the campus news is not covered as adeqiiately
and as fully as it should be. But we have reasons:
limitation of space, handicaps with regard to size
and capability of staff, pressure of dry, routine an-
nouncements which keep out more vital, reada le
news. As for pictures, we wish we could supply
the overwhelming percentage of 6-1 who want more
cuts. Our only answer to that is that cuts cost
money, and our budget is pretty tight this year.

Now if any of our faithful readers would care
to offer The News an endowment, we can solve all
our problems by increasing the size of the paper
to eight pages, and using more “art.” \\-Te might
even achieve what has always been

The Pitt News Dream . . .
a daily newspaper.

Until that Utopian occasion, we shall have to
struggle along with present conditions and facili-
ties, meanwhile making every attempt to follow the
suggestions made by students on the poll.

But now we must get back to work; or to be
more accurate, sneak out of the office to avoid all
those long-winded publicity directors who will be.
insisting that their pet items be given “a good story
on the front page with a big headline and pic-
tures. ”

‘Color Organ’ Music Confusing

To Novice Audience, Says Reviewer

By Jack Brady

Lumia, man’s newest art creation,
in which the organist uses form, mo-
tion and color, was unveiled for the
ﬁrst time to a Pittsburgh audience on
Friday evening in Stephen Foster
Memorial. Thomas Wilfred, the in-
ventor, presented a recital on his
“color organ,” the Clavilux.

Because of this reviewer and most
of the members of the audience have
been accustomed to the numerous vi-
brations and odd-voiced characters
of Walt Disney cartoons, the general
opinion was, “it was technicolor with
a hangover.”

Impressions received from various
fellow reporters are that the compo-
site colors ranged from “beautiful to
passionate and then to decidedly be-
low par.”

Although Mr. ' Wilfred and other

members of the Art Institute of Light
would undoubtedly enjoy such an
evening’s entertainment, this writer

found it monotonous because music
to the ear has been more appealing
than this new proof music to the eye.

However, these facts do not detract
from Friday evening’s performance,
but show the unfamiliarity, of present
audiences in being unable to appreci-
ate this type of art.

Mr. Wilfred demonstrated his abil-
ity in combining color in many di-
versiﬁed shades. Along with the
light “compositions” were musical
accompaniments to get the audience
in “the right state of mind.”

Projected upon the screen were
colors and grotesque forms going
through various motions.

Possibly such a recital will seem
more realistic in generations to come,
because by that time the general
public may have become educated in
the art of light and might appreciate
more the color symphonies on the
screen.

The Clavilux has switches, rheos-
tats, pedals, levers and buttons slid-
ing in grooves. Mr. Wilfred uses all
of them during the concert and
reads music of his own composition.

Numerous searchlights placed at
different angles are arranged behind
a translucent screen made of silk
which has been treated with gelatin.
Various types of lenses are used in
the lights to get the correct intensity.

“This art of colored light compo-
sitions is destined to become the
eighth art of the world,” said Mr.
Wilfred in a special interview with
The News.

He declared, “Through this mobile
art form, a better approach to the ab-
stract art can be obtained.” He be-
lieves that rudimentary skill in play-
ing the Clavilux can be obtained in
about four years, if the student has
proper coordination, rhythm, color
and “a sense of the feeling of ﬂow.”

SLOGAN of the day last‘ Monday was “I’m_ a fu-
gitive from a Cwen gang.” Wonder if the
members of Cwens realized that they were selling
RED carnations on MA_Y DAY. Maybe the Dies
committee should investigate.

Walter ‘VV'inchell, and many others, are supporting
present projects to aid foreign refugees, will prob-
ably be taken by a certain portion of the public as
proof that newspapermen ARE crackpots.

If that is the case, we’d just as soon be classiﬁed
in the crackpot class. After all (credit line to
'\.Vinchell) many of the framers of the American
Constitution were refugees.

It’s amazing to discover how many usually
backward-looking reactionaries have suddenly he-
come far-sighted prophets of economic doom be-
cause it is proposed that a few selected refugees
be permitted to enter this country the same way
as their not-so-distant “100 per cent American”
ancestors.

on the effectiveness of the latest U.
S. move to bring order out of the

Chief criticism of the fault-ﬁnd-
ers was that the message to Hitler
and Mussolini throws the U. S. into
a battle of words that is not our con-
cern. This side of the question was‘
upheld by the Villanova College V il-
lanovan, which said: “Isn’t it natural
that the dictators viewed this plea
with misgivings‘? They certainly
perceived an inconsistency of views
in the attitude taken by Mr. Roose-
velt. We hope that in the future the
heads of our governments will re-
frain from making rash statements
that will jeopardize the intrinsic
value of noteworthy appeals made
in good faith.”

However, in a majority were the
comments in favor of the President’s
appeal. The Rollins College Sand-
spur summarized the position of the
supporters of the President in this
fashion: “Roosevelt has taken a
momentous step in attempting to
force the hands of the dictators. Al-
though it may fail, such an attempt
is better than for the most powerful
nation on earth to adopt a philosophy
of futility toward a world war.
Every protest against domination by
force will swell the tide of world
opinion for peace.”

Collegians in growing numbers are
advocating strict neutrality as the
only position for the government to
assume in the present world situa-
tion. But they would temper neu-
trality with the application of eco-
nomic retaliation against the ag-
gressor and totalitarian.

The real solution, according to the
editorial opinion of collegians, is the
development of a mass-mind which
will view with objectivity the many
stories that will be printed about the
new developments in world politics.
They ask that we watch carefully for
propaganda that will be designed to
create a war-minded public.

Here’s how the Dartmouth College
Dartmouth stated its views on this
point: “The headlines scream at
campuses just as they do at taxi-driv-
ers, and the least we can expect
from campuses is that they realize
they are being fed with war propa-
ganda, and that they think calmly,
and sanely, not react blindly, easily,
catastrophically. Let’s decide on a
program for thinking.”

Mountaineer Nine Engages Panthers

iln Baseball Revival Friday, Saturday =

By Bill lVIcElwain
Pitt baseball gets its home in-

Panthers l7 ace ~

also brought back a big, continuous:
smile.

The hurrying Pittmen retired the
s Gates sprint medley cup
when they won the spring medley for
the third time. The cup was the old-
est in the Penn Carnival and had
been in circulation since 1923.

For winning the half mile relay the
Panthers received the Provost Penni-
man Challenge cup for the second
year in succession. Ohio State is the
only other school with two legs on
this cup. Pitt received two cups for
the mile relay triumph.

‘WIN PLAQUES

The Murphy cup, which requires
ﬁve wins before permanent possession
can be established, also went to the
Olsonmen for the second successive
"year. Manhattan and Penn are other
two-time winners of the cup. The J.
Keating Willcox Memorial Mile Re-
lay trophy remains in perpetual cir-
culation.

The cup-collecting Panthers took a
foothold on the Kappa Sigma Chal-
lenge Quarter Mile cup with a ﬁrst
win of the 440 relay. In addition to
the silverware the Panthers won four
plaques, one for each relay triumph,
that award Pitt the “Champions of
America.”

Thoma

Pitt’s relay teams, which started to
collect Penn Relay wrist watches by
the dozen last year, returned with
enough jewelry to do a lot of time
keeping. Aside from winning re-
lays, this system of sandwiching two
Pitt men between lead-off man Frank
Ohl and anchor man Johnny Wood-
ruﬁ‘. wins  lot of time pieces.

OHL COLLICCTS

Frank Ohl received four watches;
Johnny Woodruff, three; Al Ferrara,
three; Art Thomas, two; Larry Tre-
gonnin.g_. two; and Clyde Graf, two.
Inclividual members of each winning
relay combination receive watches
instead of medals and the four
Panther wins resulted i.n sixteen
watch awards. Last year Pitt won
three relay titles with nearly all the
jewelry going to this year’s winners.

The Class B Mile Relay team, Del
Anderson, A1 Boulanger, A1 McKee,
and Larry Tregonning, was awarded
medals for its third place ﬁnish.
Johnny Bazyk’s fourth in the dis-
cus netted him a medal.

The relay team and rest of the
track squad may augment their col-
lection of tinware when they look in

on the IC4A and National Champion-

ships later in the season. Meanwhile,
if you want the correct time, ask a
trackman!

lntrarnurals

By Arthur Reinstein
Independent second~in-command Babe Stark has issued another

challenge.
‘We’re not afraid of Mendlow.”

Says Babe, “Every team gets scared when they play us.

Stark and his Gamma Gamma \Voo teain-mates have some reason
for feeling cocky, for they are easily the class of the independent

1

loop. In the Engineering circiiit, Oil and Gas leads the parade with

a powerful attack that has averaged¢

about 25 ru.ns per game.

The two leading “non—fraternity”
nines are good, but their competition
just isn’t. Most of the playing in
these leagues has been over the con-
ference table in Director Potts’ of-
ﬁce.

While the ‘independents talk, fra-
ternity teams are still waging a hot
ﬁght for the title. SAM’s favorite
son, Lew Mendlow, joined St. Louis
Card Lon Warneke in the “I almost
pitched a no-hit game” club on Sat-
urday.

Lew came within one strike of a
no-hitter as he stopped Sigma Alpha
‘Epsilon, 3-0. A pop-fly single to left
with two down in the ﬁnal inning
ruined the masterpiece.

Phi Delta Theta eked out a 14-13
win over Phi Epsilon Pi. The Phi
Delts picked up 2 in the ﬁrst and
then ran wild in the second to score
12 runs on an even dozen hits. Dan-

consistently by the Phi Eps, but the
big second gave him too much of a
lead to lose.

Bill McBride blasted a home run in
the last inning to break up a tight

a 4-3 decision over Pi Lambda Phi.
Phi Kap Glenn and Pi Lam Jaffe
were waging an even duel when Mc-
Bridels round-tripper settled the is-
sue.

Phi Gamma Delta and Delta Tau
Delta won on forfeits, while four
other clubs lost points for failing to
show up.

After a long postponement, caused
by bad weather and a few unclassi-
ﬁed reasons, golf and tennis are
slated to begin next week. All
matches are to be played on the
Schenley Park course with the tennis
enthusiasts taking their exercise on
the Trees Gym courts. Any two men
in the University may enter the golf
tournament as a team. All the tennis

nies’ “nothing ball” was hammered will be singles tussles.

ai1g11i'21l for the first time since
1924 when the 'Wcst. Virginia dia-
mond creation opposes the Panth-
ers at the Stadium Friday and
Saturday.

The Mountaineers have a weird
record in their matches to date. One
of the dizziest baseball series in tri-
state collegiate competition gave the
Morgantown club successive wins
over Ohio Wesleyan by scores of 19-
14 and 23-19 recently.

POOR COMPARISON

Last week St. Mary’s trimmed West
Virginia by a more respectable 5-2
margin. Throughout the season,
Mountaineer hurlers have been only
moderately efficient, but the batters
have connected with nearly every-
thing tossed at them. .

Only one valid comparison can be
made of the Panthers and the Mor-
gantowners and that must be by an
indirect method. None of the teams
encountered by the Panthers have
been met by West Virginia, but the
Mountaineers did play Michigan
State which played Duke which
swamped the Mitterlingmen.

On that basis, the visitors must be
conceded a deﬁnite edge. Duke, vic-
tor over Pitt, 13-6, and 19-3, edged
State 3-0, and the Spartans in turn

' stopped West Virginia 7-5.

SOPHONIORE SLUGGERS

The chief hope for a Pitt win rests
with the power packed in the Panth-
er bats. Five sophomores in the start-
ing lineup will carry with them bat-
ting averages of better than .300.

Three-fourths of the inﬁeld belongs,
to the select group of sluggers with!

two outﬁelders completing the quin-
tet.

AL HOLBROOK
. . pitchcr’s worry . . .

 

Junior Ed Keiper rounds out the out-
field, while Phil Scheiding, also a
junior, is pretty deﬁnitely set at ﬁrst
base since Guy Guadagnino has be-
come Gabby Hartman’s understudy
behind the bat.

Andy Johnson had originally been
held as the likely starting mounds-

[man for Friday but his showing last
{Saturday was so definitely inferior

center fielder A1 Butch is the top ‘to that of righthander Eddie Haluska,

stickman with a .368 average, but
close behind him is the pride of All-
clerdice High, Al I-lolbrook. Far
from being handicapped by wearing
glasses, the chunky second baseman
has rattled off a .357 percentage,

_ _ _ ,many of his swats coming with men
p1tcher’s battle and give Phi Kappa‘ A

on base.
FOLIART CONNECTS

Working with shortstop
Straloski, who has compiled a .313
average, Holbrook is half of a lively
second base combination. Despite a
slight tendency toward innacuracy in
his throwing, A1 is a ﬁrst rate de-
fensive cog.

Extra base blows have constituted
most of Bob Foliart’s safe drives, with
the result that the hot corner guard-
ian has chased six runs across the
plate in batting .353. In last Satur-
day’s intra—club game, won by the
first stringers, 11-2, Foliart crashed a
double, a single, and a pair of home
runs.

Frank Goelz, left ﬁelder, completes
the list of .300 swatters with a .333.

Woodruﬂ to Make Final Appearance
On Home Cinders against W. Virginia

Long John Woodruff’s ﬂying feet?

skim over the cinders of Pitt Stadium
for the last time in collegiate compe-
tition as the 1936 Olympic half-mile
champ makes his farewell home ap-
pearance, when the University of
West Virginia trackers meet Coach
Carl O1son’s star—studded aggrega-
tion Saturday.

IGNOREI) AT HOME

Woodruﬁ will be in his best form
Saturday and with Frank Ohl, John-
ny Bazyk, Larry Tregonning, and Co.,
will provide quite a show for local
track fans, who will have their ﬁnal
opportunity to View one of the great
running marvels of all time. The
greatest spiked-shoe attraction in
Philadelphia and New York he never
has been paid a tribute by the Pitts-
burgh district.

No one can really have a fair idea
of his ability until they have seen this
human machine in motion. New York
realized it along ago, and last Satur-
day New York papers played the
Panthers’ Penn Relay triumphs above
their World’s Champion Yankees.

BEST BY FAR

When Johnny brought the baton
across the line in the mile. relay at
Franklin Field, 35,000 fans rose to
pay tribute to the greatest anchor
man in the history of any American
relay events. John Paul Jones, Ted
Meredith, Bill Carr, Glenn Cunning-
ham, Jess Owens, Gene Venzke, and
Don Lash were outstanding perform-
ers in the long history of annual re-
lay classic, but none approached
Woodruff’s two day feats.

After leading his team to three
wins last year, 01’ John was even
more brilliant this year in bringing
his team home ﬁrst in three of Pitt’s
unprecedented four wins. On Fri-
day he started his sprint medley an-
chor leg several yards behind N. Y.
U.’s Curtis Giddings and Fordham’s
Frank Slater.

JOHN WOODRUFF
. . . last home meet . . .

A gangling, awkward youngster in
his Olympic triumphs, he has come
a long way since then, and is now a
conﬁdent master of running craft. He
was content to stay behind Giddings
and Slater until the back stretch of
the ﬁnal lap. Then, unwinding his
tremendous legs, he streaked past his
opponents and ﬁnished a good ﬁfteen
yards in the lead.

His time of 1251.2 for this half mile
on a wet track was only two seconds
shy of the world record. He not
only neared world record time in the

Ghalf, but was clocked in 21.2, for his

220 in the 880 yard relay and 47.4 for
his 440 in the mile relay, both close
to world marks.

Although Woodruﬁ’s accomplish-
ment of anchoring seven ﬁrst place
quartets in three Penn Relay carni-
vals will probably never be equalled,
Frank Ohl in only two years of var-
sity competition has been lead-oﬁ
man on seven victorious quartets.
THAT MAN‘OHL

Frank’s brilliance has been some-
what overshadowed by Johnny’s but
in every one of the four relays
Frank was in front of the pack when
he brought the baton to the second
man. His time of 4.8.3 for the lead-
off quarter in the sprind medley and
47.9 in the mile relay ranked second
only to Woodruﬁ°’s, and Frank’s per-
formances were made from a crouch-
ing start.

His most outstanding mark came in
the 880 yard relay when he reeled
off a 20.7 furlong, eight-tenths of a
second faster than his best previous
mark. Jess Owens, the “World’s fast-
est human” never did better than
20.3.

“TRIG” STARS

Al Ferrara also turned in the fast-
est time of his career when he led
off the distance medley team on Fri-
day with a 48.6 quarter. Al is al-
ways at his best against stiff compe-
tition, and when Olson benched
Thomas Saturday in favor of Ferrara,
the Ford City ﬂash came through in
ﬁne style. His 440 in the mile also
showed his competitive mettle.

Sophomore Larry Tregonning gave
indication of a promising career in
his anchor leg against Cornell Friday
in the 440 relay. His 220 stunts in
the sprint medley and half mile re-
lays were also excellent. Sophomore
Clyde Graf in the feature mile event
and senior Art Thomas also perform-
ed. capably.

Eddie -

who yielded four hits in six 11'1n1t1gs,

Cage Coach Calls
Opening Practice

According to Dr. H. C. Carlson,
director of the student health service
and head basketball coach, practice
for 1939-40 basket ball enthusiasts
will begin 4 o’clock, the afternoon of
May 8, in the Stadium.

Practice will continue 1% hours a
day Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.
and Friday for two weeks. At the
end of this period, all tryouts and a
limited number from The News edi-
torial staff will be feted at a picnic-
party on the Carlson farm-and-dude-
ranch-for—college-boys.

Interested students are requested
by Dr. Carlson to check on eligibility
cards this week. Practice will begin
promptly at 4 o’clock next Monday.

Geneva in initial
Home Net Battle

Pitt’s tennis team tries for its ini-
tial win of the current season this

afternoon against Geneva at 2:30
o’clock on the Stadium court. The
Panther’s record so far this year

shows three defeats and no victories.

Because of the poor showing made
by mos. of the players against East-
ern rivals, the lineup, from the num-
ber two spot down, will probably
show several new faces.

Captain Joe Kristufek’s outstand-
ing court play was the consoling fea-
ture of the recent Eastern tour. Kris-
tufek gave Dave Johnson, No. 1 net-
ter on George Washington’s squad, a
stiff battle before succumbing 6-2,
6-3. The match was much closer than
the score indicates.

Later in the afternoon. Kristufek
teamed up with Adrian Hartman to
down Johnson and Fleming 6-4, 6-2.
Johnson is one-half of the tandem
that captured the National Junior In-
door Doubles Championship last
year. Only Gil Hunt, national high-
ranking star rates above Johnson in
Washington, D. C.

In the meloncholy affair at Bethle-
hem, Pa., in which Lehigh white-
washed Pitt 9-0, Kristufek dropped
his singles engagement to Kantrowitz,
Middle Atlantic Collegiate champ
and a ﬁnalist in the National Junior
Indoor Singles Championships.

Kri.stufek lost the ﬁrst round 6-2,
mostly because of nervousness. Kan-
trowitz won the second set 6-4, but
Joe had the Lehigh ace at ad-point
in nine of the ten games. Throughout
the duel, Kanty’s high bouncing serv-
ice troubled the Pitt star.

Had Kristufek come through in the

second set—oh well, the ﬁnal count

was 6-2, 6-4.

4
I

the Cornell outfit at the State Col-
lost course. One day later, Pitt
will match clubs with the Staters and
will probably receive the some treat-
ment that the Mt. Nittany golfers
handed them last Saturday.

FLUNKS HURT

Pitt’s chances of surviving the tor-
rid Association play this year are
about equal to those of the proverbial
snowball. There is a definite gap be-
tween the ﬁrst two positions and the
rest of the team that needs bridging.
The remaining four players are sadly
lacking in experience and it will take
at least another season. before they
show signs of being ripe for Associa-
tion competition.

That the Panthers should be in
this shape is attributable almost
entirely to the bugaboo of scholastic
eligibility which caused the retire-
ment from school of such stars as
Nonnenberg, Doak, and Barrett
“Ain’t I Swell?” Melvin.

Tony Kaye and Bill Daddio will
u.ndoubtedly be  their usual slots in
the coming week-end’s series. The
rest of the team, Reilly, McClintock,
Seybold, and l\/Iathias, will be juggled
around, if nothing more than for
luck.

STATE UNBEATEN

Kaye can probably repeat his last
week’s win over State’s Jack Ma-
haffey, Jr., but Daddio can expect a
real contest from Bud Miller whom
he barely defeated previously. The
State Lions added another win to
their record when they topped W.
and J. last Friday. Their schedule
stands to date, four wins and no de-
feats, the wins being chalked up
against Rutgers, Army, Wash-Jeff,
and Pitt.

The State record throws a distinct
shadow on the Panthers recorded golf
doings thus far this season. One vic-
tory has been hung up, this with Car-
,negie Tech, and two matches have
lbeen dropped, one down in the hills
E to West Virginia and the latest to the
; State Lions who spell trouble for the
i Pitt crew, along with Cornell, in next
iweek-end’s scheduled clashes.

IGHT up a pipeful of cool-smoking Prince Albert
and forget your worries about tongue-bite. Here’s
the rich, full-bodied smoking of choice tobaccos—with
extra mildness assured by an exclusive “no-bite”
process that removes harshness. Prince Albert is
“crimp cut,” too, to give you the smoothness of slow
burning and the joy of easy drawing. Sound pretty _
good? Well, the proposition’s better yet—for you can i
try Prince Albert at our risk. A risk we take gladly,
for there’s no other tobacco like it.

Men Debaters Will Alter

Organization

Next Year

Eight on Standing
Team Will Debate

Other Universities

Reorganization of the Men’s
Dclmtiiig Association. to allot in-
tercol'leg*iate (lebating to a squad
of ciglit men under the direction of
a iiianager and four assistants was
announced. today by Abe ‘Volc-
vitz, C40, manager.

Eight members will be chosen on a
competitive basis from the 60 mem-
bers of the Association to represent
the University in intercollegiate de-
hating, according to Wolovitz. The
remaining members of the organiza-
tion will be the mainspring of the
county-wide extension debate pro-
gram.

To aid him in producing a pro-
gram for the new set—up, Wolovitz
has appointed four assistants in
charge of the year’s work. Ernest
Larson, C40, will serve as general
assistant manager. Fred S. Robie,
C41, was appointed assistant man-
ager in charge of audiences and will
be assisted by William Seyler, C42.
Assistant manager in charge of radio
discussion will be Rugy Aldisert, C41,
aided by Stanley Ungar, C42.

Thomas Abdo, C41, will act as as-
sistant manager in charge of hospi-
tality. William Tait, C42, Ralph
Nadler, C42, and Leonard O’Con-
nell, C42, will be Abdo’s assistants.

“In revamping the present setup,
we plan to meet the problems of an
increased schedule made possible by
a larger membership,” says Wolo-
vitz. “In the past, there has been no
official debating team, apart from the
association as a whole.”

Plans for next year’s schedule in-
clude proposed international radio
debates with two Canadian universi-
ties and with Edinburgh university.

The new manager stressed the idea
that staff work under one or more
of the assistant managers was neces-
sary for a member of the organiza-
tion to be considered a candidate for
future Inanagership.

Players to Give
Pulitzer Drama

Against the whitewashed walls of
the Foster Memorial stage, Pitt Play-
ers will present the rlrst non-proIes-
sional showing of “Our Town” next
Tuesday and Wednesday, May 9
and 10.

Thornton Wilder’s Pulitzer prize
winner has been selected by the Play-
ers for its encore play of the season
during Spring Festival week.

The technique of “Our Town,”
whose public appeal was proved in
its tremendous Broadway success,
calls for a bare stage upon which the
entire interpretation of the play de-
pends on the actor’s work.

Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire,
from 1900 to 1913, is the locale of
the play. Wil.der depicts life in a
small town, especially through the
stage manager’s part, played by Earl
Riley, C39.

Two tickets for “Our Town” are
included in each Spring Festival
book, and may be purchased individ-
ually at 50 cents at either the eighth
or ground floor Players ticket booths,
Harrison. Chandler, l\/I39, business
manager, has stated. They will be on
sale daily from 11:30 to 2:30 o’clock.

Season tickets for Players’ shows,
wh:7ch allowed for admission to three
productions this year, will not even
be good for rebates of “Our Town”
tickets, Chandler declared.

Collernliolae to Hear
 on “Early Man’
’ Collembolae, honorary natural sci-
ence fraternity, will hold a dinner
meeting Frida.y at 6:30 o’clock in
1037 Cathedral. Dr. Daniel Busch,
instimctor in geology, will speak on
“Evidence of Early Man in North
America.”

The group will make an overnight
ﬁeld trip to Cooper’s R.ock State For-
est, near Morgantown, West Virginia,
Saturday and Sunday. Dr. J. Lin-
coln Cartledge, professor of biology
at the University of West Virginia,
will lead the group.

Students wishing to attend either
of these affairs may sign up for them
on the tenth floor bulletin board.

Ad Clnli Officers Slate
Election Meeting Today

Election of officers for the Pitt Ad
Club will be held today at 2:30
o’clock in 151 Cathedral, announces
Frank Smith, BA30. president.

According to Smith, the organiza-
tion is new on campus: “a temporary
one to lead toward starting a chapter
of Alpha Delta Sigma, national pro-
fessional advertising 1"raternity, at
the University.”

Other officers for the present sea-
son include Ralph Rosen, BA39, vice
president; Charles Allen, C39, record-
ing secretary; Richard Haughton,
BA39, corresponding secretary; and
William Rock, C39, treasurer.

Today’s meeting will be open to all
students interested in advertising.

Coeds to Enter
Sports Events

The women’s sports program for
Spring Festival week will be con-
ducted on the basis of inter-class
competition with the presentation of
a Wimbleton Cup at the conclusion
of the program, announces Joy Hart-
man, Ed40, chairman of the events.

Each sports event will be included
in the cup competition, and all win-
ners will be given a certain number
of points to be counted toward their
class score. At the end of the sports
events all points will be added, and
the class having the highest number
of points will receive the Wimbleton
trophy.

Friday evening at the Spring Fes-
tival sports dance the 16s—inch cup
will be presented to the class. Later
the trophy will be engraved with the
numerals of the class and placed in
a show-case in the new gym.

Besides the trophy there will be
individual prizes for each event. Blue
ribbons will be awarded to individ-
ual winners and red ribbons to run-
ners—up.

Wscl. to cm
Merit Panthers

Merit Panther pins will be award-
ed to February freshman women to-
morrow at 3:30 o’clock on the twelfth
floor.

Pins will be awarded on the basis
of scholarship, friendliness and coop-
eration. Other qualiﬁications are a 1.0
quality point average with no fail-
ure or incomplete work and a pass-
ing grade in the customs exam.

Marjorie Kuhbach, C40, chairman
of the Customs committee, announces
that sandwiches and punch will be
served to all February freshmen and
members of the Customs committee
who attend.

And it is true about Bill I-lo~eveler’s
legs. It is regarded as fact that sev-
eral stage-door Johnnies were wait-
ing with bouquets for “Flo Marshall”
at the  entrance of the Nixon.
Bill. Angel, who also has legs, has
taken over Walt Cavalier’s old place
in the girls’ chorus. .

Best of the songs was Ade Rob-
son’s “Diary of Dreams.” It avoids
the awful skips and intervals that
kill off most college-authored lyrics.
Bud Hoffmarrs “Nothing Is Too Per-
fect For You” is nice, as is sax man
Jerry l'Jisner’s “Not So Very Long
Ago.” Lee Campbell turned in a
good job of vocalizing on this tune.
Robson’s other number, “Jupiter Has
Nine Moons,” is terrible.

The widely heralded “can-can”
number was a complete success. Only
disturbing element were the gartered
shanks of the “chorines” which
would have set an artistic ballet
dancer stark, raving mad.

There isn’t space to say much more,
but for additional credit, consult the
lower part of your program that lists

all the business, costume, props, and

makeup crews that never get the
glory. They were on the job.

And anyway, you’ll see the show

By Lewis Riley

It it’s possible to dance away spring
fever, Spring Festival week seems
likely to mark that malady’s de-
mise.

By the time the last couple departs
from the Senior Ball on May 13, three
orchestras, eleven full hours of danc-
ing, and over $2,000 will have poured
over the dam—-—all that Pitt eds and
co-eds may be completely “dance—
conscious” during Festival week.

Wild animals, sideshow barkers,
sawdust, an “ideal date” contest, a
style—contest, a circus tent, and a
deluge of novelties and prizes——in
fact, practically everything that a
full battery of publicity agents could
conceive—have been called into serv-
ice in order to stamp the word “co-
lossal” on each of the three dances.

First of the three Spring Festival
dances is scheduled for Wednesday,
May 10.

“Typical-college” apparel will re-
ceive the nod of approval when a
committee of campus style “experts”
climb out on the limb by choosing
“Joe and Josephine College” from
among the Wednesday tea dancers.
