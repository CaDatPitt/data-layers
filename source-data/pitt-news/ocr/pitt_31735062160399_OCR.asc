Law Professor Criticizes
Agnew Subpoena Ruling

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Dr. Richard, Seeburger, Pitt
Constitutional law; professor spoke
out yesterday on Vice-President
Spiro Agnew*’s obtaining court
authority to subpoena reporters.

“This case where a judge has

‘given Agnew’s lawyers the power

to subpoena (reporters)--they're
probably makingthe wrong de’ci—

_ sion,” Seeburger said.

He said Agnew wants to be able

to show the "Justice Department

officials are trying to prejudice his
case by unduly inﬂuencing subse-
quent juries.

“But he hasn't been indicted
yet,", Seeburger said. “So this
decision is probably premature." _

Seeburger said until Agnew is
indicted, the information reporters
have is not useful. If the material
has been influencing subsequent
juries, the case could be thrown

p out.‘ ,

“In any event, if there was to be
an important decision (subpoena) it
should have come after the
indictment, and not before,”_
Seeburger said.

Reporters do not have absolute
authority to withhold information

Supreme Court ruling made June
30, 1972.

The case involved three report-
ers who had refused to give
information to federal grand juries.

In what 'is ‘known as the
Branzburger case, reporter Paul
M. Branzburger of the Louisville

. Courier-Journal, appeared before a

grand jury, but refused to name
two persons he had seen making
hashish after he had been invited to
watch the process. .

The next year he refused to even
appear at the grand jury in a case

7 0% express dissatisfaction

according to a.

involving similar charges.
-Heclaimed the first amendment

right of freedom of the press.

Then in June, ‘72, the Supreme_
Court, after hearing the cases of

.three reporters, voted 5-4 that

journalists have no first amend- ,

ment right to refuse to disclose
confidential sources and informa-
tion.

After the ruling, the New York
Times quoted Justice William 0.

Miclclle East War Rages
Heaviest Since '67 CIas 

BY MICHAEL CLINTON _
A The heaviest fighting in the
Middle East since the 1967 ‘war

erupted this weekend, resulting in -
Israeli clashes with Egypt along the =

Suez Canal and with Syria in the
Golan Heights.
According - to The New York

Times, each side accused the other

' of having started the fighting. But

United Nations military observers

Voter Registration Declines

BY LARRY PANSINO

A recent campus "voter registra-
tion drive signed up 204 new voters
who will be eligible to‘cast a ballot
for the first time ininext month's
general elections.‘ The figure was
‘only 10% of the total registered

.« here last fall before the Presiden-

tial election.
The light registration was due to

' the ‘absence of ‘ a glamorous race

and the already high percentage of
registered students, said Sam
Rosenzweig ', president of the
College Young Democrats here.
“There is no -real race for mayor
this fall. And Allegheny County is
the top county in the country in
percentage of eligible youth regis-
tered," Rosenzweig said. ‘
Mayor Peter Flaherty has almost
guaranteed his reelection by
winning the Democratic, Republi-
can and Constitutional‘Party
nominations in the May primary.
His only opponent is Socialist
Worker candidate Paul "Le _Blanc..
Democratic Party Ward Chairman
Bill Gasior confimed the low

  Popularity

A poll of Pitt students, conducted
this weekend by the Pitt News. has
revealed 70% are not satisfied with

" President Richard Nixon.

The question, based on a similar

 query used by the Gallop Organ-

ization last week, was “Do you
approve or disapprove of the way

Nixon’ is handling his job as
President?" ‘ Of, 381 randomly.
selected students, 70% dis-

approved of Nixon's performance, r

16% approved, and 13% were’
undecided. t ,
Last week's Gallop Poll showed
another clip in Nixon’s popularity
with 32% approving, 59%ﬂdis-
approving, and 9% no opinion.
This compares with 35% approval

 in a poll conducted September 7-10

and 38% approval in a late August
poll. .
Nixon's popularity sank to it
lowest point, 31% approval, in
early August during the televised
Watergate Hearings. His highest
popularity, 68% approval, occured.

registrations were uniform across
the Oakland district. “We staged
four days of registration at #24
Engine House of the fire depart-
ment. The sessions lasted for three
hours each day and we added about
10% of the 1001 who registered last
fall. ‘

“With the 18-year-olds being
given the right to "vote last year and
the presidential election to attract
interest. registration was higher

than normal. Now that the law has. ‘

taken ‘affect and there is no exciting
race. registrations are lower."

Rosenzweig said he was not
surprised by the relatively light
registration. ‘A‘Only 16% of those
registered in this district voted in
last May's primary, despiteour
efforts to make it easier for
students on summer_ break to
receive absentee ballots. Compare
that figure with the 81 ‘/2 that voted
in the presidential ‘contest last
November.‘

“Some students who live on
campus are unaware of the city

Rating Slumps

Last week's Gallup Poll was
made during discussion of the
possibility of indicting Vice Pres-
ident Spiro T. Agnew and followed
the government’s announcement
that consumer prices had their
biggest increase in 26 years.

environment in which they live
most of the year. Being in the
dormitories is like having a local
apartment--you're not isolated
from the rest of the community."

He stressed the importance
student vote can have on 1 local
elections, saying if the 3500 dorm
students block voted in a block,
they could control many district
races and even « elect a state
representative. p

Of the. 10,000. Pitt undergrad-
uates, Rosenweig speculated about
8000 were registered in Oakland or
at home. He said future campus
registrations would concentrate on
enrolling freshman.

Rosenzweig. and the Young
Democrats support proposals mak-
ing the registration process more
accessible, including registering
through the mail and more readily
available absentee ballots.

Rosehzweig said, “We anticipate
a much larger registration next
spring before the gubernatorial and
senatorial primaries. The Young
Democrats will spend more time in
promoting‘ the drive then. The

recent one was a low kev affair."

Of the 204 registered in the last
drive, 151 were Democrats, _40

were Republicans and '13 miscel-
laneous, according to figures
provided by the Citizenship Infor-
Director Jane E.
Thompson believes most of the new
voters are Pitt students. -.

Douglas assaying, “A reporter has
an absolute right not "to appear
before a grand jury.”

Four of the five judges voting for
the ruling were Nixon appointees.

_“However, there is a hedge in

' this ruling,” Dr.‘Seeburger added.

“That in order to make a reporter
reveal his sources and information,
the prosecution ‘must have "a good
reason.”

The higher courts have not yet
made this interpretation. However
in several lower cou t cases, the
courts have been very restrictive in

 making decisions calling reporters
.to reveal their information, See-
burger said. I

“I don’t think in this particular
case that there is a good enough
reason to subpoena the reporters,”
Seeburger added.

Agnew’s case does not present compelling or important reasons for
if forcing reporters to reveal confidential sources.

  

'\ -.

 

 

 I Agnew may be "correct when he says that his constitutional rights to

1  the presumption of innocence were compromised by news leaks

..  attributed to the Justice Department. The fact remains however, that

i.?—:i.'1.the leaks have occured. The issue now is if, and to what extent the
. leaks have violated his right to the presumption of innocenceand dfree
‘-trial. The source of the leaks is totally irrelevant.

   
   
 
 

 I ‘Agnew is certainly aware of the irrelevancy of the issue ofthe identity
1- of confidential sources. He is also certainly aware of the issue’s
if potential to obscure the real question -- his alleged criminal activities,

Agnew is also tuned in to the American people's sympathy for anyone

in “purgatory,” If he can project himself as the martyred scapegoat of

"i  zealous free press he will have a case which, although unpersuasive
 , to the courts, will certainly win him favor in the eyes of the American
‘ ‘ peopl. ' Recent events would indicate that Agnew would prefer a trial
 by public opinion to a trial by jury. ‘

 

\

 v-The Govemment’s arguement against Agnew’s -insistence for
° immunity from prosecutionjs a strong and persuasive one. In addition
to the legalistic arguements, for the -Govemment to maintain its
integrity and the confidence and support of the American people it is

' essential that this issue be resolved by the courts. Dismissal of
 the evidence would strike a crippling blow to the American judicial

A ’ system, it would leave the office of the vice president permanently‘

§"l"i'- _ stained and it would contribute to the American people’s ever
diminishing confidence and respect for their government.
. l

'The grand jury should proceed at once to review the charges against
Agnew. Attempts on his part to tamper with the judicial process and

V place himself beyond the reach of the law should be recognized for
whatthey are, and ignored.

slowly and carefully to Pitt.

(3o|umn andla I-lalf  

I would like to tell you a story about a half a ‘dozen
muffins. Sometime in the middle of last week, I was
on my way to the Pitt News with a more or less urgent

piece of writing. The piece of writing was urgent

because a space had’ been laid out for/it, and nothing
else was handy to fill that particular space.

/

As I was leaving the house, the landlady popped
out. Popping out is a habit of landladies. She had no
breakfast rolls for the coming morning, and asked if I
had any. No. She asked if I could get her some. I
said I would.

The I went out to the magical bus, which currently
has a disease called “loose heads”, and ‘steered it
I did whatever
newspaper people do for a while; outside an
enormous storm got itself going. There was plenty of
lightening, and the thunder followed at a
satisfactorily short interval. The thing was right over
our heads.

Watching a thunderstorm is’ one of the finest
entertainments available. It is a rare pleasure in
most of the world. Here, in Pittsburgh, the
thunderstorm is available. in its most perfect form.
There is generally no charge for this form of
entertainment, unless the lightning happens to strike
your own personal roof, or roast your own personal
car, or interrupt the power and stop . your own
personal clock and make you late for work.

Thunderstorms happen here all , the time, but
especially in the spring and in the fall. It is best to
enjoy them from an attic window, or some other place
where you can see over the neighboring rooftops.
The lakes and plains to the west of Pittsburgh give .us
an endless stream of cool and dry air. The valleys of
the Ohio and Mississippi funnel warm wet air into the
area. The Allegheny Mountains stop everything.
The various kinds of air mix, and enormous storms
are spawned.

th Watch the next one if you get a chance. It is worth
e trouble. The whole sky gets cut into pieces, like a

jigsaw puzzle. and the lines whereit was cut are
made out of real fire. . ,

_ . \
Anyway, that is what happened last week. I had to
drive home through the storm.

It is not easy to drive from Oakland to.the Highland
Park area in the daytime; Somebody has decided to

close most of the bridges in thisipart of the city[ The

‘t.

‘ out of use.

bridges are needed for cars to cross ‘the deep valleys
between the hills of Pittsburgh. Most of the valleys
have railroad tracks in them. Most of the tracks are
-Trains are dead.

The bridges to get across the tracks of the dead.

trains are also dead. Traffic is routed away from the I

dead bridges by vague arrows. - The arrows. are
attached to signs which say: “Your tax dollars at
work." The tax dollars are very busy». They have to
be. There are hardly ever any city employes at work
in the vicinity of these signs.

When it’ rains on Pittsburgh, the citizens react.
Most ‘of them promptly-forget that they have ever

. driven in wet weather, even if it has rained just that

-afternoon. They either stop dead or go like hell;
either overreact or pretend it is not raining at all.

There is no way to judge whether a given set of
approaching headlights is in front of an idiot who
wants to go ninety miles an hour or is preceding some
'yoyo reluctant to go as fast asfive miles an hour.

_ These people annoy one another. Some of them try
to passthe others. This where the rest of us meet
them. They are either right in front of us, crawling,
or right in front of us, as visitors from the other lane,
going like hell. av

All this is history. I got home, barely, but I forgot
the landlady’s breakfast rolls. ‘ ‘ '

She was annoyed. Breakfast was coming up in
about ten hours, and breakfast must have its rolls. I
apologized. I

Upstairs, I got to thinking. Another trip outside
would be an enormous nuisance. I would
manufacture some breakfast goodies!

" Idid. Muffins seemed easiest and fastest, and that
is exactly what I made. I do not eat muffins myself,
and have no way to judge them, but I kept a few for
my roommate, and she thought they were pretty
good. The landlady thought they were fantastic. I
suspect that she was more astonished at any kind of
muffin coming from a .young man (everything is
relative. She is forty-nine years older than I am. I
am a young man.) than concerned with the quality of
the muffins themselves.

.What had just happened on'the field was no big surprise to him.‘

f - There is a sign in the Pitt lockerroom that says, “The team that
‘I makes the least mistakes will win thevgamef" f That is what happened.
i in the Pitt-Tulane game. —

‘The Panthers physicallywhipped the Green Wave. They moved the

Pitt fumbled the ball ﬁve times, and Tulane recovered "four of the

‘ five. Green Wave defenders al picked off four Billy Daniels passes."

‘Pitt fumbled the ball five times. and Tulane recovered four of the
five. Green Wave defenders also picked off three Billy Daniels passes. ‘

‘Pitt had just one interception_and one fumble recovery.

Turnovers are usually individual mistakes, and it really is surprising

that Pitt hasn't done this before, what with the numberiof freshmen ‘ '
‘playing on the varsity. i . V

Majors had warned everybody that this would happen. "-‘We've got

I’ ("the youngest team in the country," he reminded. “You can’t’tiirn this

program around overnight. It’s going to take time for these kids to

It was not the same Johnny Majors that was extremely disturbed ’

‘ '3_'over the way his team had played against Baylor. He saw plenty of '

things to be happy about in the Tulane

game, and he had to fight back a_

“Against Baylor, the entire team played poorly, he went on. “But
against Tulane the team as a whole played well. It was just too many ,
individual mistakes that killed us. ” V 

Majors hastened to remind everyone about his youthful squad. “If it
had been juniors and seniors making theﬂmistakes, I’d have been.
upset. I But mostly it was our young people, and not always the same

ones.” i ,. , . -
One of the weaknesses of the Panther_game Saturday was the punt

returning. Freshman return specialist Robert Haygood." who had been
injured in the Baylor game_and hadn’t practiced much in the last two
weeks, fumbled several times, and bobbled some as well. The layoff
and low-hanging sun undoubtedly contributed to his below average

. performance.

L Daniels played one of-his best quarters to start the game. In the

, - final stanza, though. he played one of his worst, the desparateness of‘
 thesituation contributing to the hurried pas_ses that were intercepted.

.While the above-mentioned shortcomings can be corrected in time
game Saturday, there is one problem that will be
harder to solve. I . ‘ V
The problem is that there isn't anybody who can replace Tony
Dorsett. With “TD" out of the lineup, the Pitt offense loses its sting.
Melvin Howard is ineligible thisyear, and he is the only Cat who has
shown any of the dazzling skills Dorsett possesses. -
Pitt receivers continued to drop "passes at an abnormally high rate,
and Majors may be forced to use his slower but more sure-handed
receivers in certain situations. ‘ l
‘ The two Tulane touchdown passes spoiled an excellent performance .
by the Pitt defense.“ The “Mad Dogs" were bolstered by the return of A ’

With their backs to the wall,

up with good field position on the
kick but a delayed clipping call

Bad luck hasbecome the Pitt soccer '

Leo Bemis and his boys were about
to notch their first impressive
victory of the season, a sudden turn
of events sentthe bootersdown at
the hands of the Temple Owls, 2-1,-
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

That “bad luck” camein the last _
seven minutes of the game, after
Pitt had appeared" to_ enjoy a slight

ledge in— play throughout the

contest. John Curley’s' goal with‘29
jminutes gone in the's'_econd half put
Pitt -in front and the Bemismen
rejoicing‘ in anticipation. ~
Curley took a pass from Joe
Luxbacher _ and raced down the
center of. the ﬁeld, a single
opponent to challenge him directly. ._
Curley had'a teammate on each‘
wing but elected not to pass offas

' the Temple defender gave ground

readily. Curley let loose with a
blistering r_ightik'ick from about 20

The Tulane Green Wave over-
whelmed the Pitt Panthers 24-6 at

Pitt Stadium Saturday afternoon,-

as they were supposed to according
to the oddsmakers, but a lot of what
happened came as a mild, surprise
to the 25,000 people. in attendance
as well the people close to the
situation.

A lot of what happened was
downright loony--that’s spelled
Terry Looney. ,

Take these examples: The game
was" supposed to be an offensive

one, with Pitt’s- Tony Dorsett and ’

Tula_ne’s Steve Foley as the big
stars. A
Foley left the game with injuries

‘before the first half came to an end’. -_

The fans watched Dorsett run for
60 yards on the first Pitt offensive
drive and only total 77 yards the
rest of the afternoon. Foley, who
was supposed to. dazzel via'_the

ground had his only moment of.

glory early in the second quarter by
engineering a one play drive--a 40
yard pass play to split end Frank
Anderson. ’ . '

Tulane found itself leading 14-0,
a few moments later’, with the
benefit of only oneffirst down. '

Pitt nose guard Gary Burley,_who
"—wasn’t supposed to play did an
excellenfjob. and Tulane superster
defensive ‘lineman Charlie Hall-
(6-6, 260), who was supposed to

play excellently, never laid _a hand

on Bill Daniels. \

W,hy even the officials"seemed-
spellbound and moon crazed.’ They
overtly missed throwing the flag on
several unsportsmanship like con-
duct plays. 1

'—say, ‘his bell rung’.

However, both Dorsett and I

Two things that were__suspected,

brother--midway through the ﬁnal
stanza and directed another scoring
drive in the waning moments.

The difference was definently_
the Green Wave defense. And,
David Griener. in 3’ particular.
Griener, alsenior, had just won his
job as Tulane-’s monster man
defensive back and made the most
of it. Griener recovered the fumble

As each day passes. the plot
' thickens. Who will become League
champions? Who will win the
campus rchampionship? Can the
Charlie Browns ﬁnally be beaten?

Answer to these miestions and

more should be supplied within the

next several days, as the intramur--

 toward aclimacticﬁnish. .At the
1 ‘end of the rainbow is the proverbial

‘ pot of gold—-the campus champion-

Several teams took their ﬁrst step
toward the goal last Thursday
evening with impressive victories,
but none looked better than the

' Biology Bugs.

Behind a sixteen-hit attack, the
Bugs disposed of the Psyches,
12-9. to move into the quarter-ﬁnal
of the Graduate-Faculty League.

Melaragnoiand Wurst were the
big guns for the Bugs. Melaragno
went 4-for-4, including two doubles

. and a three-run homer, and Wurst

got on base in front of him three
times on singles. The ﬁrst four
hitters in the Bugs’ lineup scored
10 of the team's -12 runs. to
neutralize a ﬁne offensive perfor-
mance by Psyches' Cowen.

Pitt’s JV football team got off to

a winning start Saturday night by
beating Potomac State Junior
college 23-12. . -
Offensively, Pitt relied on its
passing game. Quarterbacks
Anthony Kozak, Mark O‘Toole, Pat
Carey and Dave Migliore all saw
action-. Carey had the “better day”
according to Head JV Coach "Bob
Leahy but O'Toole also played w_ell.
He threw a 50 yard pass to Ron
Medley who was downed on the

one yard line. Bob Hutton carried '

\

in for the score. .

Leverga Walker had a great‘ day
rushing for 100 yds. in seven
carries. One of those carries was a
70 yd. run for a Pitt touchdown.
Greg McCray did a “ﬁne job”
returning a kickoff for 65 yards and
carrying the ball ﬁve times for 46
yards. Medley had four receptions
for 60 yards.

Six 0f AP’s Top Ten
Survive Scares To Win

AP---The collective sigh that
echoed among college football
teams from coast to coast on
Saturday came for the most, part
from such places as Alabama,
California, Oklahoma, Pennsylva-
nia, Indiana and Tennessee as six
of the nation’s leading schools
avoided upsets.

Third-ranked Alabama, trailing
14-13 in the ﬁnal period, got an
eight yard touchdown run from
Gary Rutledge and a 17-yarder
from Randy Billingsley and turned
back Georgia 28-14.

Anthony Davis scored-twice on
short runsifollowing Oregon State
mistakes as fourth-rated Southern

V California defeated the winless

Beavers 21-7.

Steve Davis scored twice and

" passed for a third touchdown

leading a second-half rally that
lifted No. 6 Oklahoma over No. 17

Doing the “most outstanding
job" according toe Leahy, Tight
end Jim Corbett had six receptions
during the game. Overall Leahy
thought his offensive line did a
“good job."

The Pitt defense intercepted for‘

a total of four times and recovered
two Potomac fumbles. Quarter-
back O'Toole went in as safety and
picked off a Potomac pass. Mike
Prokopovich, Russell Price, and
Paul Test also had interceptions.

Recovering fumbles were Gary
Silvestri and Kurt Kovak.

“Defensive Lineman Joe Mac-
erelli did a real good job,” said
Leahy. '

Pit‘t't secondary did “fairly well”
according‘ to Leahy. They gave up
two touchdowns. Potomac threw
Pitt off guard as the Panthers
expected Potomac to runout of the
wishbone but instead used the
double wing and threw a lot-

Miami of Florida 24-20.

Air Force led seventh-ranked
Penn State 3-0 but Tom Shuman
threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to

"Gary Hayman, and John Cappel-

letti scored from four yards out 34
seconds later and the Nittany Lions
went on to a 18-8 victory.

Wayne Bullock scored on a
one-yard run and Tom Clements
passed 30 yards to Pete Demmerle
as eighth-rated Notre Dame sput-

'tered to a 14-10 triumph over

Michigan State.

Tennessee, ranked ninth, over-
came a 21-7 halftime deficit and
nipped Kansas 28-27, stopping
passing ace David Jaynes on an

attempted two-point conversion
run with 3:15 left.
The other members of the

Associated Press Top Ten had '

things pretty much their own way.

» J

The ﬁrst time Potomac scored
was on an 80 yard pass and the
second and last touchdown was a
15 yard pass.

Leahy says he has a “young"
secondary and “work will cure it.”

As expected Pitt played a 50
defense and ran out of the pro I
with split backs.

“Effort was the key,” com-
-mented Leahy and “I was pleased
with it.” * -'
