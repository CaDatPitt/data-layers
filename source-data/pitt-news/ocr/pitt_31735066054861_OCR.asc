Halloween may be over, but election
day can be just as scary if you don’t know
the facts about the candidate you are voting
for. The following is a list of some of the
major issues that affect college students in
.omorrow’s presidential election and how
the two major candidates, Bob Dole and
Bill Clinton, stand on each.

EDUCATION

Education is important to everyone in
the United States — especially those
enrolled in higher education. Our next pres-
ident has a large role in what happens with
the state of education in this country. The
Democrats feel that the federal government
can be an effective agent of school reform
by providing school districts with ﬁnancial
incentives for achieving educational stan-
dards. The Republicans feel that the
Department of Education is an example of
“micro-managing,” and education should
be solely in the hands of each individual
state.

Clinton -— President Clinton feels the
Federal Department of Education is a viable
tool and supports a strong federal role in that
department.

During his term of office, Clinton
signed into law the AmeriCorps national
service program, which offers college stu-
dents help with their tuition in exchange for
volunteering in the community. He also
signed into law the Goals 2000: Educate
America Act, an attempt to develop a

national system of skill standards and certi-

ﬁcations.
During a campaign stop at Robert

Monis College, President Clinton talked

about wanting to help students
to be able to afford higher edu-
cation. “I believe that the cost
of any education after high
school, the tuition costs, up to
$10,000 a year, ought to be tax deductible
—— any education,” he said.

Dole —— Bob Dole feels that the Department
of Education isn’t necessary and supports,
its elimination. He would divide the depart-
ment’s budget into block grants to the states.
He has said this would allow more of the
money to be used for education and less for
government employees.

Dole supports a voucher program for

parents to use at the school of their choice,
allowing low and middle-income families
the ability to select the best schools for their
children. He also supports making English
America’s official language and
requiring all citizens to be ﬂuent
in it and emphasizing Western
traditions and American values
in the school curriculum.
Voluntary, student-led prayer in schools is
another issue that Dole will ﬁght for.

In an interview with the Associated
Press, Dole expounded on his educational
beliefs. He said, “I believe that school
choice and returning education decisions
back to the local level will reinvigorate
America’s education system, and prepare
children to compete and excel in the global
economy of the next century. The only way
to restore accountability to our schools is by

 

    

wresting control of education policy away
from Washington bureaucrats and returning
it to parents and local communities.”

DRUGS

Drugs are a major concern in our coun-
try. Families and their children are affected
by drug abuse every day. Our next president
will inherit a major drug problem in this
country and must have a plan to do some-
thing about it.

Clinton — Despite the fact that drug use is
on the rise among young people, President
Clinton has done many things to curb it dur-
ing his terrn. First, he elevated the status of
drug czar to a cabinet position and ﬁlled the
post with a retired four-star general. He has
tried to stop the trafﬁcking of drugs into our
country, and cut aid to Colombia after he
found that it wasn’t doing its part to stop the
drug problem.

President Clinton has proposed the
largest drug budget ever, a $15—billion bud-
get for ﬁghting drug use, and promises to
spend more money on anti-drug education
and treatment programs. He has also given
public housing authorities the power to
evict any tenant that is found with drugs or
involved in traﬂicking.

While on a campaign visit in Stamford,
Conn., Clinton said, ‘The drug problem
will be changed when America changes —
when we assume responsibility for our-
selves, our families and our communities.
We have to send a constant message to our

children that drugs are illegal, drugs are

dangerous, drugs may cost you your life ——

Third Party candidates hope tomorrow will be independents’ clay

Russ Krebs

 

Despite what the two major
political parties would have you
believe, there are several third-
party candidates running for the
presidency. Unfortunately, there
isn’t much information avail-
able to the public about many of
these candidates. Here is a brief
look at three of the major
“minor” candidates:

Ross Perot — Perot is a very
wealthy Texas businessman
who would like to become
President. But if he isn’t elect-
ed, he would like to at least

change America’s historically
two—party system intoa three-
party system with his Reform
Party. He spent most of his time
this election? season creating
that party, and not very much
time campaigning until the very
end.

Perot’s main issues are eco-
nomic nationalism, balancing
the federal budget, reforming
campaign laws, and passing a
Constitutional amendment
requiring public referendums on
all tax hikes. Even if he doesn’t
win, he has said he hopes his
run will stir things up and put
pressure on the president to
clean up Washington’s ﬁnances.

Ralph Nader — Despite the fact
that he is better known as a con-
sumer advocate than a politician,
Nader is nrnning for president
under the Green Party. He doesn’t
accept campaign contributions,
so the problems of releasing
records of campaign funds will
never affect him. Nader has said
he hopes his name will further
substantiate the Green Party and
help its membership grow faster.
Nader’s primary concern is
corporate power over the nation’s
political institutions and the econ-
omy. He feels that the special
interest groups are running the
country, and he wants that

stopped.

    

Reform Paty cadiate
Ross Perot.

Harry Browne —— Browne is

dent. He is a long—time
Libertarian, but has never held
office. If elected, he would elimi-
nate income tax because, as he
says, “Govemment doesn’t
work.” In addition, he said he
won’t replace the tax with any
other program. Another plan of
his is_ to sell off government
lands, parks, and holdings to pay
off the national debt and end
Social Security forever.

These three will probably be
just known as “also—rans” after
the election, but their views may
affect the way government is run

running under the Libertarian in the future and help to legit-

Party’s endorsement for presi-

imize their parties.

STATE TREASURER

Republican Barbara Hofer

 

Barbara Hafcr, the auditor general, is
battling for the state treasurer’s seat on elec-
tion day.

Hafer, 53 and a mother of four, started
her career as a public health nurse and health
care administrator. She grew up in
Pittsburgh and went to Dormont High
School.

After attending the South Side Hospital
School of Nursing, Hafcr received a B.S. in
nursing from Duquesnc and did her post-
graduate work at the University of London
and Pitt.

She was the first woman elected to the
post of Allegheny County commissioner
and the first woman Republican to be elect-
ed to statewide office.

“She is very personable. Shc’s a strong
leader and a relentless leader,” said Steve
Schell, who works for Hafcr.

In the past seven years as auditor gener-
al, Hafer has cut worker’s compensation
claims by 40 percent, brought to light the
misuse of “walking—around money,” and
has retumcd ﬁve million dollars into the
state’s general fund.

“Barbara Hafcr has brought innovative
ideas and new technology to the auditor

gcneral’s department,” Schell said.

In 1990, she warned the state that
spending was too high. The next year the
Pennsylvanian deficit was over $1 billion.
Hafer cut her own salary by $10,000 and
asked others to do the same. Taxes were
increased the next year.

“During her tenure [Hafer] has elimi-
nated an audit backlog,” said Schell.

Hafer has a six—point agenda if she is
elected. First, she said she plans to reform
the existing tuition reform program. Second,
she wants to cut the risk and improve per-
formance of local government investments.

Hafer said she wants to make the state
employee and teachers’ pension plans more
efficient and eliminate the mismanagement
and lack of disclosure in the treasury. She
said she also wants to bring our money back
to Pennsylvania and ﬁnd banks competent
enough to manage it. Finally, Hafcr plans to
use the trcasurer’s pro-audit powers to pre-
vent waste and fraud.

Hafcr said ethically, she stands tall and
wants to continue to do so, but in the carn-
paign for state treasurer a lot of mud—sling—
ing has gone on.

“It bothers me,” said State Rep. Don
Walko. Even though he dislikes” the way the
campaigns are nm, he thinks, “Barbara
Hafcr has it.”

   

Democrat Mina Baker Knoll

Christene Mueller _

Mina Baker Knoll is vying for the seat
of state treasurer that her mother, Catherine
Baker Knoll, has to give up.

Knoll, 41, was raised in McKee’s
Rocks. She is a CPA at the accounting ﬁrm
Deloitte and Touche in New York City.
Knoll attended Penn State University and
received a B.S. in accounting. She later
went to Walsh College in Michigan and

graduated with a Mastcr’s in taxation.

Knoll said she wants to follow in her
mother’s footsteps.

“No one can simply hand me this job;
it’s entirely up to the voters to decide,” said
Knoll in a press release.

Knoll has 18 years of experience with
international and domestic banking. She
said she wants to be state treasurer because
she understands how business investments
work, and this can save and make the state
a lot of money.

If Knoll is elected she said she plans on
expanding the Tuition Account Program.
The program is like a tax—free IRA for par-
ents, with the restriction that the money can

only be used at state schools. The program
allows parents to put aside money for their
children before they enter college.

About 15,000 students are using this
program “one way or another,” said Jack
Collins, Knoll’s press secretary.

“It can be used for any education
expense,” said Collins. It can be used for
graduate school if a student started saving
money as a freshman.

One of the Knoll’s goals for the pro-
gram would be its expansion to the school
of the student’s choosing, according to
Collins.

Some say Hafer’s platform is over-
looked because the public and the press
wonder whether Knoll’s residence really is
in Pennsylvania or New York.

“It’s terribly negative and I’m turned
off by it a lot,” State Rep. Don Walko said.

Hafer responded in a press release to
questions about residency’s role in the carn-
paign with, “I am a Pennsylvanian.” Knoll
has experience in business but wants the
voters to decide if she’s the one they want.

“If you’re a student  you’re going to
be a taxpayer,” said Collins. “Give us your
vote and wc’ll try to help.”

CORRECIION: The only person running unopposed for on office in the College
Republican elections, which are Nov. l2, is Malt Mills, who is running for
president. The slot for secretory has three candidates, public relations chair has Iwo,
vice president has two, and business choir has two as well.

THE PITT NEWS

l4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

3

Republican Bill Ravotti

Democrat

   

 

The road to the 14th Congressional dis-
trict goes through Oakland every two years.
This year, a Pitt political science course has
been a signiﬁcant pit stop for Rep. Bill
Coyne and challenger Bill Ravotti.

As his Republican opponent did a week
earlier, Democrat Bill Coyne appeared
before the Topics in American Elections
class, where he discussed his voting record,
denounced Bob Dole’s 15 percent tax cut,
and promoted his experience in the House.

Coyne, a 60-year-old resident of
Oakland, has represented his home district
in Congress for the past 16 years. Coyne ﬁn-
ished serving his eighth term as a member of
the House Budget Committee and the Ways
and Means Committee.

He said being a representative with
seniority allows “the hopes and wishes of
our people [to be] heard in Washington.”

While Coyne ﬁelded an hour’s worth
of questions from students, the difference
between him and Ravotti became obvious.

Coyne was formal and stoic, standing
with an erect posture behind the podium,
quite a contrast from last week’s grinning,
lean—against—the-podium persona of Ravotti.

As it turns out, Ravotti and Coyne’s
political platforms differ in proportion to

Bill Coyne

their personal dispositions. Bill Coyne’s vot—
ing record reﬂects his beliefs. A gun control
advocate, Coyne voted for the Brady bill
and supports a tax hike on ammunition,
although he adds, “If people go through the
requirements under the law, I see no prob-
lem with the possession of a handgun.”

Coyne voted against welfare reform.

“We can’t just say ‘two years and
you’re [on your own],’” he said of the new
welfare codes. “If we expect to move people
off of welfare roles, we can’t do it by pro-
viding [states With] precious little money for
training and re—t1aining and even less for
daycare.”

While mentioning the Congress was
“streamlining government” by dismissing
250,000 Federal employees, Coyne defend-
ed the role of government in student aid and
aﬂirmative action, which he called “a pro-
gram with a positive track record” He said
the government has a responsibility to make
services available and provide for those who
can’t do it alone.

Coyne said he also supports govern-
ment agencies like the Department of
Education and Environmental Protection
Agency.

“If we are to maintain clean water and
clean air as ideals, we need the EPA to
enforce the [regulations],” Coyne said.

With a Pitt political science class as
his audience, U.S. Congressional candi-
date Bill Ravotti attacked his opponent
Bill Coyne while revealing his political
platform.

The Republican candidate for the
14th Congressional District, Ravotti told
students that 16-year incumbent Bill
Coyne was past his prime.

“My strength is my energy and new
ideas,” Ravotti said. “[Coyne] is two
times my age, and I don’t think he has the
energy.”

Ravotti’s aggressive words come
from an equally—aggressive campaign
that started two years ago with letter cam-
paigning. He also made countless public
appearances.

“Church festivals, Friday night foot-

ball games, spaghetti dinners, you name -

it, I’m there,” Ravotti said. He ran this

grassroots campaign so voters would “no -

longer see Bill Ravotti the Republican,
but Bill Ravotti the person.”

During a 40-minute question-and-
answer session with the students, Ravotti
laid the foundation of his platform.

He is anti—gun control, speciﬁcally
opposing the Brady Bill, which he said

punishes law—abiding hunters by infring-
ing on their rights. He doesn’t ‘favor
Congressional term limits because “they
limit voter recourse of candidates.”

Ravotti tiptoed around the issue of
student aid and said banks should be free
to compete for student loans and making
education more affordable through tax
cuts.

“Tuition would be less of a burden if
[the government] would let parents keep
more of what they earn,” he said.

Ravotti spoke out against environ-
mental regulation of business, open trade
policies such as the North American Free
Trade Agreement, the Global Agreement
on Tariff. and Trade, and affirmative
action.

He also wants to cut foreign aid by
$72 billion and create a separate social
security system for people age 50 and
under.

Some students reminded Ravotti that
his strong conservative views were
enemy ships ﬂoating in liberal waters.

Addressing a student wearing a
“mean people suck” T—shirt, Ravotti said,
“I like your shirt, but do you think I’m
mean?” ,

“Well, you are Republican, so yes,”
the student quickly responded.

Frontrunners 

and the penalties for dealing drugs
are severe.”

Dole —— Bob Dole plans to cut
teen drug use in half by the year
2000 with his “Just Don’t Do It”
motto and by creating 1,000 new
community-based anti—drug coali-
tions. He will ensure that the drug
czar has all the necessary funding
and work to make this a stronger
office. Dole was the co-sponsor of
the congressional study on drugs
and youth.

Dole wants to get tough on
the drug community. He favors
mandatory sentences for selling
drugs near schools and the death
penalty for international drug traf-
ﬁckers. He wants to introduce
more spending on drug education
and treatment.

In an Associated Press inter-
view, Bob Dole said, “The bottom
line is you need strong moral lead-
ership in the White House, some-
body in the bully pulpit speaking
about family values and
Hollywood and television, all the
violence we have and all the drugs
we have.”

ENVIRONIVIENT

America has a strong envi-
ronmental movement. However,
even though most voters see the
protection of our natural resources
as important, some people feel
that we have gone too far. The
next president needs to be able to
protect the enviromnent for future
generations.

Clinton — President Clinton has
taken a strong stance on the envi-
ronment. He issued a “Pollution
Disclosure” executive order that
requires industries to disclose
information about toxic emissions

programs and fought to protect it
from budget cuts.

Clinton said in a campaign
stop in Illinois, “Our challenge is
to leave our enviromnent safe and
clean for the next generation.
People do have a right to know
that their air and their water are
safe.”

Dole —-— Bob Dole has voted for
and helped pass every major piece
of environmental protection legis-
lation in the past 25 years. He co-
sponsored the Safe Drinking
Water Act, ensuring healthy drink-
ing water for all Americans. He
also had a major role in making
sure that the Clean Air Act, Clean
Water Act, Endangered Species
Act, and the National
Enviromnental Policy Act passed.
He has said he will continue
to support these programs, as well
as give the states and local com-
munities the money they need to
meet environmental challenges.
During a campaign stop in
Florida, Dole said, ‘The environ—
ment is important to me. I will
keep supporting it when I’m elect-
ed and will help to get the funding
to restore the Florida Everglades.”

CRIME

Crime rates may have fallen
over the past few years but many
Americans are still in fear of
becoming victims. The boom in
youth crime and the more random
nature of urban violence are two
of the major reasons for this feel-
ing. Our level of crime is nearly
ﬁve times as high as it was 30
years ago.

wants juveniles charged with vio-
lent federal crimes to be prosecut-
ed as adults, regardless of their
age. Dole will eliminate parole for
violent criminals, ensuring that
they serve their full prison term.

Bob Dole supports victims of
crimes. He will issue an executive
order that requires federal prison-
ers to work no less than 40 hours
per week and have their earnings
sent to the victims of the crimes
they committed. He has said he
will also make it impossible for
criminals to legally purchase guns
by establishing a National Instant
Check system.

Dole said during a California
campaign stop, “With Bob Dole
as president, the govemment will
once again protect its citizens from
crime. In our administration,
women won’t be afraid to walk
alone at night, children will be safe
playing ball in the neighborhood

to buy a second lock for the front

door.

HEALTH CARE

It is estimated that at least 43
million Americans don’t have
health insurance and our medical
care system keeps getting more
and more costly. Many Americans
need help in this area and our next
president will have a key role in
this problem.

Clinton — President Clinton
signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum
health insurance bill that allows
people to keep their insurance
coverage when they change or
lose their jobs. The bill also limits
exclusions for pre-existing condi-
tions when purchasing health

l9TI+ LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT

Democrat William Robinson

Christene Mueller

 

William J. Robinson, who is
running for the 19th legislative dis-
trict, has been a dedicated communi-
ty leader since 1974 and is currently
on the Board of Trustees at Pitt.

Robinson is 54 years old and
presently a representative for the

19th district. He graduated from‘
' Schenley High School and attended

Ohio State University, then moved
on to receive a Master’s degree in
political science at Duquesne
University.

State Representative Don Walko
supported Robinson and said he is
there for the people in his district,
unlike his opponent Mark Brentley.
“Bill Robinson will easily win
because he is responsive to his con-

stituents.”
The 19th legislative district
encompasses Oakland, the Hill

District, downtown, the South Side,
and part of the North Side.
Robinson’s background experience
includes serving on the Pittsburgh
City Council between 1978 to 1985
and eight years in Harrisburg as a
state legislator.

Robinson’s platform is broad.
He supports the development of
jobs, education reform, and tax
reforms. There is one thing he is
very clear about, though — his con-
stituents. He said he is more focused
on their needs than his opponent.
“That is the major difference
between myself and my opponent,”
Robinson said.

A member of the Board of
Trustees at Pitt, Robinson voted in

for the concerns of the area busi-

  Mark
Brentley

Christene Mueller

 

As a brand~new contender in
the political arena, Mark A.
Brentley, a “do it yourself” party
candidate, has had very little polit-
ical exposure and can almost defi-
nitely not be labeled a “career
politician.”

That might be because Brentley,
39, is not involved with any promi-
nent political party. In fact,
Brentley created his own political
party to run against William
Robinson for the 19th legislative
district.

He graduated from Perry High
School and attended the
Community College of Allegheny
County. Presently, he works for the
City of Pittsburgh Department of
Public Works.

Brentley’s campaign platform
deals with youth issues in the 19th
district. He said his focus is on
combatting crime and improving
the number of jobs available in the
area. Another issue he is pursuing
is the creation of ajob center that is
community—oriented. He also wants
to reform welfare and human ser-
vice programs so that districts that
need more money are able to
receive funds from the government.

Building the
perfect candidate

Campaign ‘96 is a rather big disappointment in our eyes.
None of the candidates for president ﬂoats our boat. So, rather than
make some half—hearted endorsement of a candidate we feel less
than enthusiastic about, we’d like to pontiﬁcate about what the
ideal candidate would be.

Harry Truman put it best when he said, “I don’t believe that
the USA wants any more fakers — Teddy and Franklin are enough.
So I’m going to make a common sense, intellectually honest cam-
paign. It will be a novelty — and it will win.”

A down—to—earth campaign is exactly what this country needs.
Politicians need to quit trying to confuse us with roundabout
rhetoric. It doesn’t work to try to placate us with hollow promises.
The time has come for candidates to stop telling us what is wrong
with their opponents and to tell us what they intend to do if elect-
ed. '

The president should have clear policy objectives and stick to
them. Of these objectives, free education for all should be high on
the list. The way to better this society is to make education avail-
abletoallwhoarewillingtoputintheacadernic worktoeamit.
In the land of the free, education should completely governmen-
tally funded. ,_

We want intellectually well-rounded, trustworthy candidates.
The way to demonstrate that a candidate ﬁts the bill on this point
is to check his record. Realistically speaking, most candidates
have served in oﬁice before making a bid for the presidency.
Therefore, each has a voting record, in the case of legislators such
as Bob Dole, or a record of actions in oﬁice in the case of gover-
nors (e.g. Bill Clinton). The way to judge the honesty of a candi-
date’s campaign promises is to see how he handled similar issues.

We need to be reasonably sure that the candidate will uphold
his responsibilities to his constituents. Once again, we must look
intothepastrecordofthecandidatetoseehowheheldupinthe
past. Did he promise A and then vote for B? If so, he fails. Ifhe
promised A and delivered A, then we have ourselves a worthy
president.

Might as well face it, you're addicted to politics

 

Election day is tomorrow. We

who will win, who will lose, and

Carville put it in “Al1’s Fair,” “A

max, if you will. And once you get
that feeling, there’s nothing that can
match it.” This year, my candidate,
Clinton, is the sure—thing winner, but
Istill feellikeljustmetthemanof
my dreams, took him home, and
found out he’s a eunuch. Why?

First of all, the sexual nature of
an election comes ﬁ‘om the tension.

‘The major candidates have all

Republican. The reckoning moment
comes when you arrive at the polls
and decide who you’re going to take
to bed. When the results come out,
will your choice be the one left
standing? Now, if it’s a close race,
this is where the tension comes in.
You have your fingers crossed
and hope your boy comes through in
the clinch. This feeling is lost if it’s a

Secondly,  between

One of the greatest problems
facing politics today is the death of
strong, cohesive parties. Believe it or

 

   

not, the political party machine was a
good thing. The party machines
made it such that when someone
voted Democrat, he knew what he
was getting: strong social programs,

military machinery, help for the
working man. When he voted
Republican, he automatically got
business tax breaks and big defense.
The Democratic party was the party
for the average person and for labor,
the Republican party was for the rich
and for business. More got done
because elected oﬁcials voted with
their parties and therefore, policy
agendas were set. There were no
Republicans in Democrats’ clothing

is, he declares
himself without
 reserve in favor of
someone or against another. This
policy is more useful than remaining
neutral.” The candidates need to take
a stand and put the intensity and grat-
iﬁcation back into the campaign.

/ COUNTERPOINT

To vote or not to vote?

Only voting provides representation

 

,If the elections are a blow-out,

should I bother to vote?

So the presidential race has been
about as engaging as that show
between “Friends’.’ and “Seinfeld” ——
you keep following it in the back-
ground out of habit but know that
you could be doing something better
with your time. Not only has the out-
come already been beaten into our
heads as often as the message of an
Oliver Stone movie, but Mr. Clinton
and Mr. Dole seem to have nothing
more to say to young people than
“Don’t do drugs or I’ll take away
your driver’s license.” Given such
circumstances surrounding Tuesday,
why should we bother to head to the
polls?

When most people, especially
students, consider why they should
bother voting, two major reasons
come to mind: “my vote will affect
the outcome,” and “my vote gives me
the right to gripe for the next few
years” (a ‘90s way of referring to
civic duty). However, we believe that
a third motivating factor exists which
is considerably more important than
the others: if young people show up
at the polls, we force politicians to
deal with issues like student loans
and educational opportunities, avail-
able jobs with good wages, environ-
mental protection, and crime-preven-
tion programs.

Reason #1: My vote will make a
difference in the outcome of the
election.

Many congressional races in
1994 were decided by a few thousand
and, in one case, just 21 votes. A stu-
dent body could easily decide an
election. Youth Vote ‘96 has found
that young people and students could
be the deciding factor in 20 House
races and five Senate races on
Tuesday. These margins are enough
to decide who controls Congress.
While the presidential race may not
be close, the real battle on election
day is for the Congress and young
people will play a large role.

‘Reason #2: My vote allows me to

complain.

It is fair to say that if you do not

:;;v

vote or engage in the political
process in some form, you have no
right to complain. However, if the
right to be bitter motivates you, you
may well be listening to a little bit
too much Alanis Morissette.

Reason #3: If we vote, the person
elected will represent us.

   

importance of taking young people
and our issues seriously.

Ivan Frishberg of US PIRG and
Therese Heliczer of Campus Green

Vote ‘96, a coalition of over 25 youth
organizations dedicated to increas-
ing youth voter participation in

Disturbing.

Now, don’t get me wrong; I atn all for

who I’ve just asked not to vote, but you do

reading all the newspapers. Start paying real
attention to the issues. Take some classes in
economics, political science, and especially
in history, so that you will understand the
issues. And vote in other elections, like the
primaries, and the state and local govern-
ment elections. But please, please, don’t be
just another drone who becomes a con-
cerned citizen once every four years.

who know what’s going on. That’s how a
republic works.
Kris Kissel is too busy ﬁnding subtlety and
sophistication within the dynamic circle to
watch C-SPAN. Therefore, he will not vote
tomorrow.

   

If it is true that the American voter usu-
ally votes his wallet in the voting booth,
then economics is the single most deﬁning
factor in presidential elections. FDR broke
decades of Republican rule thanks to the
Great Depression in 1932. Harry Truman
was propelled to re-election in 1948 thanls
to a vibrant post-WWII economy. Ronald
Reagan took the White House in 1980
because of the inability of Jimmy Carter to
ﬁx an economy plagued by high interest
rates and inﬂation, and was re—elected in
1984 when things were going well in
America. In 1992, "George Bush underesti-
mated the severity of the recession and the
anxiety of the American people about the
future and paid the price.

The debate between Republicans and
Democrats on economics has, until recent-
ly, favored the Republican party. The party
of Reagan and less government battered
Democrats two years ago by painting them
as a bunch of tax-and-spend liberals bent
on installing a Canadian-style socialist
health care system and on expanding the
reach of the federal government. In 1994,
the Democrats were seen as the party of big
government and higher taxes and paid a
heavy price at the ballot box.

Today both of the parties are offering

two programs that have differences but one
striking similarity: neither side is offering a
truly “liberal” economic agenda. The
Republicans, failing to remember that the
main issue of the 1980 election was infla-
tion and interest rates and not taxes, have
proposed a risky tax cut plan in a cynical
attempt to win the votes of the American
people. Their plan relies upon gimmicks
and half—truths to arrive at a balanced bud-
get, and Senator Dole’s lukewarm defense
of his proposal (his heart obviously isn’t
into it) has contributed to his almost certain
defeat.

The Democrats and President Clinton,
on the other hand, have largely eschewed
liberal populism for a more pragmatic pro-
gressive agenda. The president was right

when he said in his State of the Union

address earlier this year that the “era of big
government is over.” Both parties are the
parties of small government now.

When Bill Clinton was elected in
1992, he campaigned on a “New
Democrat” agenda promoted by the cen-
trist Democratic Leadership Council
(which he once chaired), which advocates
a less intrusive and more efficient govern-
ment (in contrast‘ to the GOP’s simplistic
“govemment is bad” rhetoric). Has
President Clinton’s record reﬂected those
themes? Yes. ‘

Clinton’s record for his first two years

is mixed. Clinton pushed through free trade
pacts like NAFTA and GATT over the
objections of the Democratic party’s liberal
wing, but he also allowed his wife to design
a health care system that, while it certainly
wasn’t the terrible monster some made it
out to be, did betray the centrist principals
he campaigned on. His 1993 budget was a
brave, but had it not
become a victim of liber-
al—conservative squab-
bling, would have been
better than it was.

In his last two years
Clinton managed to turn
everything around. He
has cut the budget deﬁcit
for four straight years by
63 percent without hurt-
ing the economy, a major victory. He has
blunted, when appropriate, the excesses of
the Gingrich Congress and, when appropri-
ate, cooperated with them to get things
done (for example: the welfare reform bill
earlier this year). True enough, Clinton did
not deliver the tax cut he promised in 1992
(which he did not want anyway, but his
advisors persuaded him to offer) and it is a
good thing he didn’t. When given the
choice between balancing the budget and
giving the American people a minor tax
cut, the president courageously made the
choice to cut the budget. It is worth point-

 

It's the economy, stupid! Reelect President Clinton

ing out that the president had the candor to
admit that balancing the budget and cutting
taxes was impossible and made a tough
choice, whereas Senator Dole threw away
his principles when they became inconve-
nient to getting elected.

What does a second term hold for Bill
Clinton hold for the American people?
With the considerable
experience that the presi-
dent has picked up in his

made in his first two
years will likely not be
duplicated. The president
will probably continue
on the same course he
has been on for the last
two years: to continue to
cut the budget deﬁcit and make sure noth-
ing hinders the economy’s gaining
strength.

As a moderate Democrat and member
of the DLC, I am more than satisﬁed by the
president’s record. The deﬁcit has been in
decline for four years now, inﬂation is low
and unemployment is down. The economy
has hardly collapsed, as many Republicans
warned in 1992. Thanks to President

Clinton, we are better off now than we '

were four years ago. Let’s re-elect him.

Michael Berquist will be a happy, happy /

man come November 6th.

Use your common sense: vote Bob Dole

 

Tomorrow will be one of the most
important days in the history of our country.
We are now a generation of people who
don’t believe we are inheriting a country as
good as the one our parents have enjoyed.
And it looks as though we have it better than
our children and grandchildren will. Our
main choice tomorrow is which party can
restore the economic and social progress
which have been institutions in this country
since its foundation.

' The United States has become the
greatest nation in history
due to hard-working
individuals who have
been basically free from
government restraints.
These people knew that
if they worked hard, they
could improve their sta-
tus and leave their chil-.
dren with a better life
than they had. This is the
American Dream. Now,
the “American Dream”
is giving nearly 40 percent of every dollar
earned to the govemment with the hope of
“just getting by” and “hanging on.” Is it a
coincidence that since the growth of big
government and huge entitlement expendi-
tures, the American Dream has been in a
steady decline?

 

  

One of the main economic issues we
are currently faced with is entitlement

_ spending, which is mainly Medicare,

Medicaid, Social Security, and welfare.
Right now, these programs comprise 54 per-
cent of our budget. By 2030, entitlements
and interest on the debt will account for 100
percent of federal spending, leaving nothing
for things like defense or transportation.
Realizing this trend, Republicans have been

. trying to slow the growth of entitlements to

preserve our future. However, they have
been labeled everything ﬁorn mean-spirited
to fascists. But who’s being mean-spirited
when we’re writing checks that our children
, can’t cash? A look at the
 numbers indicates that
 Republican proposals are
very sensible, but I guess
2 common sense is not the
 Democrats’ strength.
R e s p o n s i b l e

  

budget, something our
desperately
needs. Republicans tried
to pass a balanced budget
amendment, but it barely failed, thanks to
the efforts of Congressional Democrats.
Every American’s share of the national debt
is about $18,846, and this ﬁgure is growing
rapidly. It is painfully obvious that we need
to balance the budget in order to protect our
future, but, once again, Democrats fail to

 

understand this concept. Bill Clinton pays
lip service to balancing the budget, but look

at the record — no balanced budget propos—.

als while Democrats controlled Congress,
and then two vetoes of .balanced budgets.
Now on to taxes. We are currently pay-
ing more in taxes than we spend on food,
transportation, and-shelter combined. It is
easy to see that what we are getting back
from the govermnent doesn’t come close to
equalling what we give them. A 15 percent
tax cut and more responsible government
spending is a huge step in the right direction.
In addition, lower taxes always serve to spur
economic growth, and they eventually lead

' to higher tax revenues.

One of ourforrner presidents once said,
“Our true choice is not between tax reinc-
tion on the one hand and the avoidance of
large federal deﬁcits on the other  It is
increasingly clear that an economy ham-
pered by restrictive tax rates will never pro
duoe enough revenue to balance the budget
—~ just as it will never produce enough jobs
or proﬁts.” This quote is not from Ronald
Reagan; it is from John F. Kennedy. Modern
Democrats have made the mistake of think-
ing that big governments can create wealth,
but high taxes and huge governments only
serve to restrict the economy, as Kennedy
realized.

The social issues of this election are
more difficult to explain in common-sense
terms, but they may be just as important as
the economic issues. It is well—known that if

for President

Clinton is re—elected, he will no longer be in
constant campaign mode, and he will be free
to pursue even more liberal policies. We are
looking at perhaps two new Supreme Court
justices in the next four years, and "they will
certainly support same-sex maniages, par-
tial-birth abortions, gays in the  and
aﬂirmative action. Is this really what we
want?

Like Bob Dole, I have waited until the
end to raise the character issue. We have an
administration that promised the highest
ethical standard of any presidency in ‘a long
time. What we got was investigations or
removalsof over 30 high-ranking govem-
ment oﬂicials. We literally seem to have a
new scandal every month. It is impossible to
blame Republicans for raising these issues
when we have seenso many outrageous
problems. The president of the United
States, the most powerful person in the
world, should be someone to respect and
trust. We obviously are lacking such a per-
son right now.

So, if you are heading to the ballot box
tomorrow, think about balanced budgets and
lower taxes, think about your future and
your children, think about restoring the
moral fabric of our country and our presi-
dency, and then think about Bob Dole and
the Republican party. .
Matt Mills predicts that Bill Clinton" wil

A shout-out
to my football
brothers

I 2 .»:

   

This weekend the Council for Reefer,
O-fries, and Pete’s Wicked Ale (CROP)
held an awards banquet for the elite sports
media in Pittsburgh to honor one particular
journalist -— who will remain nameless
due to a desire to do so.

As you know, awards ceremonies are
often long and boring, filled with thank-
yous and ridiculously long speeches that go
nowhere (kinda like this column).

The speech this journalist gave was no
different:

“Hey, hey what’s up everybody?
Yeah! Ward Street’s in the house droppin’
bombs like Full Metal Jacket.”

“Yo, I got to give some shout-outs to
all the people in my life and in the world of
sports, where individuals bond together in
search of one common goal — to win.
Know what I’m sayin’?”

“First, I’d like to throw crazy shout-
outs to our lord and savior Jesus Christ
because without him, none of this would be
possible. He’s the divine inspiration and the
bizznomb. Jesus drops bombs like Al
Bundy.” ,

“Next, I’d like bestow some props on
Pitt’s new Athletic Director —— Steve ‘Pitt’s
Lord and savior’ Pederson. He’s all up in
that. He’s crazy, silly, fresh, and he’s all
about winning. I’m gonna tell you, this
boy’s been at Ohio State, Nebraska and
Tennessee. The boy’s been on some win-
ners, and since Pederson’s been appointed,
our teams have blown up.”

“Check this out. First, the football
team ﬁnally beat an opponent that doesn’t
hang around the bottom of a swamp or
something like that. Its like, we beat
Boston College 20-13 on national televi-
sion on Devil’s Night. Some weird shit was
in the air that night.” ,

“Then if that wasn’t enough, check
this out. The men’s soccer team ﬁnished off
the season with a bang and the volleyball

Pit! wreaks Halloween havoc

Kevin Lilley

On Halloween
night, the Boston
College Eagles ran the
football up and down
the Pitt Stadium ﬁeld,
outmatched the
Panthers in nearly
every statistical catego-
ry and beneﬁted from
eight Pitt penalties.

Pitt won, 20-13.
That’s what Halloween
and two key Rashaad
Whitrnill interceptions
can do for you.

"They did whatev-
er they had to do to get
the job done,” said
Panther Head Coach
Johnny Majors of his
squad, now 3-6 on the
year. “It’s a very happy locker room»
tonight.”

Pitt’s offense did its job first, scoring
on an 11—play, 84-yard drive late in the
ﬁrst quarter. Junior Dwayne Schulters ran
untouched into the end zone on a pitch
play to end the drive, but the real damage
was done in the air by Matt Lytle and his
receiving corps. Lytle would hit Jake
Hoffart for strikes of 18 and 32 yards on
the drive, and hit John Jones with a 19-
yard pass to set up a goal-to-go situation
and the eventual touchdown.

Boston College answered with a ﬁeld
goal before the first quarter ended, and
would threaten again late in the second.
Under signal-caller Matt Hasselbeck, the
Eagles drove into the red zone, earning a
ﬁrst down at the Pitt 19. Running back

Rashaacl Whitmill is gang tackled after one of his two interceptions.

Omari Walker was leveled for a loss by
Pitt linebacker Julian Graham on ﬁrst
down, setting up a passing down and
Whitmill’s first trick of the night.

Hasselbeck would throw down the
center of the ﬁeld, missing his intended
receiver and, apparently, missing every-
body. To the quarterback’s surprise,
Whitrnill was able to get one hand on the
ball at the Pitt ﬁve yard—line.

To the surprise of the small stadium
crowd, he pulled the ball in for the inter-
ception, ran 28 yards to the Pitt 33, and
ended the Eagles’ offensive hopes for the
half.

“He came to the front tonight,” said
Majors of  who was in the
coach’s doghouse earlier in the practice
week. “He made some plays we expected

 

he could make.”

The second
half started with anoth-
er long Eagle drive,this

College kicker John
Matich, who missed a
39-yard ﬁeld goal. On
Pitt’s ﬁrst play from
scrimmage, Lytle rolled
to his left and unexpect-
edly met up with BC’s
Markell Blount. The
Pitt sophomore ’ was
knocked backward for
an 11-yard loss, but it
was the A left—to-right
bending of his knee that
drew the team’s atten-
tion. .

Lytle would
gingerly walk off the
ﬁeld, turning the team
over to Pete Gonzalez.
He returned for the next series, and calm-
ly ﬁnished off a seven-play drive with a
40-yard touchdown dart to Hoffart.

After his injury, though, the quarter-
back was anything but calm.

“I tried to stick him and come out,”
said Lytle, of the bootleg play that had
trainers rushing onto the ﬁeld from all
areas of the Pitt sideline. “At that time, it
felt like I did blow it out. Scared the heck
out of me.”

Lytle would ﬁnish the game with 194
yards on ten completions.

After the Hoffart touchdown, the
Eagles again answered with a ﬁeld goal.
A Panther drive stalled, and Boston
College’s offense began their version of
scare tactics.

Hasselbeck, who led his team to 501
yards on the night, started the opening
drive of the fourth quarter from his own
two yard-line. Fourteen plays later, he was
on the Pitt seven, having led his squad
through a suddenly-porous Panther
defense.

On first and goal from the seven,
Ernest Coakley stopped Walker for a two-
yard gain. Hasselbeck threw the ball away
on second down, and was sacked for a
four-yard loss by a hard-charging Coakley
and Jason Chavis. _

Fourth and goal from the nine is
another passing down, and Whitmill knew
it. This time, Hasselbeck med a sideline
pass. Whitmill stepped in front of the ball
at the Pitt five and returned it to the 38,
leaving BC with nothing to show for a 17-
play, 89-yard effort.

“That’s where we needed to make the
play,” said Boston College Head Coach
Dan Hemiing. “We got down there a cou-
ple of times, but we couldn’t make it."

Schulters would score again on the
next Pitt drive, and BC backup quarter-
back Scott Mutryn would lead the Eagles
on a touchdown drive to keep it close, but
Whitrnill’s actions had already sealed the
Panther victory. It was only a matter of
time before the ﬁnal gun sounded, trigger-
ing a fan stampede that featured the likes
of the grim reaper, a royal Canadian
mounted policeman, the wolfman, and
O.J. Simpson. complete with gloves and
knitted cap. -

‘‘I can feel the team getting a lot bet-
ter,” said Lytle after the contest. “Our con-
fidence level is rising.”

Coach Majors would complement
Lytle and other members of his offense
after the game, but focused most of his
praise on. a redesigned Panther defense,
whose 13 points allowed was a season
low.

“Our defense did a much better job,”
said the coach. “Boston College’s multiple
sets [and] motions present problems, so
[the new setup] helped us.”

Bettis led the charge, rushing for
129 yards and two touchdowns, pro-
pelling the Pittsburgh Steelers to a
convincing 42-6 victory over the St.
Louis Rams.

Although starting quarterback
Mike Tomczak left the game with a
mild concussion, that couldn’t stop
the Steelers from reeling off 244 rush-

Bettis leads the NFL with 953

The cats were looking for
cheese, the “Thriller” ghouls had
the wrong moves, but at least the
Panthers beat the Eagles.

Thursday night’s football game
proved to be one of the most excit-
ing Pitt games in years.
Disregarding the oddsmakers, who
picked them as 11-point underdogs,
the Panthers showed their best effort
of the year and defeated the Boston
College Eagles 20-13.

Pitt used hustle and determina-
tion to defeat the Eagles and looked
pretty darn good while they were
doing it. The Panthers certainly
looked better than the cheerleader
disguised as Minnie Mouse or those
fools who tried to imitate Michael
Jackson’s “Thriller.”

1 Maybe because it was
Halloween, but the Panthers’ win
sent shivers up my spine. Because
only about 15,000 people were
there, I would assume most of you
missed the wildness. Maybe you
were handing out treats to the
youngsters (or even ripping off
those same youngsters’ stash) or
decided to watch it at home. Either
way, no candy for you.

What this game showed more
than anything else was that there is

THE PI'I"I' NEWS

still enthusiasm for Pitt football.
When a team that entered the game
with only two winsand playing for
nothing else except for pride can
beat a legitimate squad like Boston
College, that shows heart.

Pitt had numerous injuries going
into the game, including season-
ending wounds for their starting
fullback Chris Schneider and start-
ing defensive lineman Mike
Mohring. In their absence, fresh
faces stepped up. Halfback Dwayne

Schulters had two touchdowns, and r

cornerback Rasshad Whitmill
snuffed Boston College with two
key interceptions.

The Panthers were able to do all
this in front of a national television
audience. Thursday’s contest was
the only game on TV that night,
meaning a majority of the football
junkies and gamblers kept at least
half an eye on it. With Pitt winning
in front of an ESPN crowd, the vic-
tory will hopefully give the network

more incentive to televise another"

Thurday night game at Pitt Stadium
next year (rumored to be already in
the works).

Of course, one negative about
the game was the crowd. Hopefully
the ESPN cameramen did not pan
the audience too often, because the
stadium had whole sections with
only four or five people in it. But

Fans flock field in a celebration of life, love, and football

Ned Schano

Halloween brings out some kooky characters.

the crowd that was there and stuck
out the cold for the whole game was
extremely enthusiastic. The student
section even went as far _as to storm
the field after the game. Ignoring
the billy-club-wielding Johnny
Laws, about 200 exuberant students
kicked over the chain fence while
chanting that they would tear down
the goal post. When the men in blue
set up a brick wall next to the South
end goalposts, the students concen-

trated their efforts on the North end.

In the end, no goalposts were
torn down. But what the chaotic
scene on the field showed following
the game was a lot of enthusiasm by
the students and players, enthusiasm
uncommon for a struggling team.
The Pitt Panthers were able to get
the monsters off their back and
finally beat a real team. Who says
weird things don’t happen on
Halloween?

unlike a couple other guys on the team, he
can hold on to the ball before it hits him
square in the grill. The only problem is
he’s from Yuba City, California. If y’all
recall back to the year Pittsburgh was
voted America’s most—livable city, you
might recollect that Yuba City ﬁnished
last. Them Yuba citizens made all kinds of
nasty songs about the ‘burgh, but I guess
that’s all right; at least Jake ain’t dissin’
our own turf.”

“My last Pitt football prop gots to go
to Matt Lytle. I mean, this guy’s gettin’
better every day. He may never be spec-
tacular or nothin’ like that, but he’s gettin’
the job done. He’s leadin’ the team around
the comer. Sure our boys ‘may lose to
Notre Dame, but we’ll put the smack
down on Rutgers and make them driz-
znown in the Ohio.”

“Whoops, I almost forgot about
Dwayne Schulters. Lil’ Greased
Lightning looks like Eric Metcalf or Barry
Sanders the way he jukes and jives all
over the ﬁeld. Him and West are the best,
at least in the Big East.”

“I almost forgot to thank my family
and friends who push and drive me to be
the best at what I do, but that doesn’t mat-
ter as long as Pitt wins. Know what I’m
sayin’? Peace out.”

in both matches, firing a combined 23 kills
and a .314 attack percentage. The senior
said she thinks this team will get better
with time.

“Youth and inexperience are the bot-
tom line,’’ said Driscoll of the team’s on-
and-off play. “I was really pleased with
how the young kids came out [against
West Virginia]. We have a lot of players on
this team that are going to be unbeliev-
able.”

Pitt took the first seven points en route
to the game two victory thanks to two
blocks each from Driscoll and setter
Stephanie Dufresne. The Panthers held the
Mountaineers to a game—low 9 kills and a
minus .094 kill percentage.

West Virginia won game three thanks
in part to good Mountaineer serving and a
plethora of Panther service errors. Pitt
came back to tie the game at 1] before a
Paula Zemrowski serve hit the net, leading
to two Mountaineer points and an eventu-
al fourth game. Pitt ﬁnished the match
with 14 service errors.

“[Serving] has been our nemesis the
entire season,” Alvear explained. “It’s the
only psychological part of our game. Vlrrth
our young players, it's been their inconsis-
tency and the lack of experience.”

Whether mental or not, the Panther
blocking was on ﬁre throughout the
match, including the fourth and ﬁnal stan-
za. Pitt turned away 34 West Virginia hits
during the Sunday match. Driscoll ﬁn-
ished with 14 blocks, one shy of the team

record.

“I’ve never seen a blocking display
like the one we put on today,” said Alvear.
“Other than Paula [Zernrowski], we’re
really an average team heightwise. I
couldn’t be more thrilled with the way
they’re blocking right now.”

Zernrowski and Dufresne ﬁnished the
match with eight block assists. Freshman
Peggy Meinhart turned away seven spikes
in the victory.

On Saturday, Notre Dame limited the
Panthers to 12 blocks and a team-low .105
attack percentage as the Fighting Irish
handed Driscoll and the rest of the
Panthers their first Big East loss of the sea-
son.

Junior hitter Jamie Lee led Notre
Dame with 12 spikes, while four others
ﬁnished with seven kills or better. Lee and
the Irish held Driscoll to 10 kills and three
digs.

“I was pleased with our team chem-
istry,” said Notre Dame Head Coach
Denise Brown. “We seemed to be very
successful getting Pitt into passing prob-
lems. She [Driscoll] can be controlled if
her teammates can’t get the ball to her.”

Pitt has off until Wednesday when
they host Youngstown State at North
Allegheny High School. Driscoll,
Dufresne, and the rest of the Panther
squad return to the Field House next
weekend for two more Big East matches
against St. John’s (Friday) and
Connecticut (Sunday).

Coyne

Coyne raised his voice when a stu-
dent challenged his vote against the ban
on partial—bi1th abortions and demanded
that he reveal the amount of campaign
money that pro—choice groups had given
him. —

After Coyne repeatedly demanded,
“Are you going to let me ﬁnish?”, the stu-
dent fell silent. Coyne acknowledged that
he did receive contributions from pro-
choice PACs, but that he voted against the
partial abortion ban.

“I voted against it because it did not
allow [an exception] if the life of the
mother is at stake,” Coyne said.

He said he would support the bill if
Congress would “take the health excep-
tion and make it a national law.”

Four weeks ago, Coyne left
Washington to focus on campaigning

with residents of the 14th district. Public
correlation is nothing new to the former
member of the Pittsburgh City Council,
who visits his district every weekend to
attend public functions.

Coyne said the main concerns of his
dist1ict’s residents are from both ends of
the age spectrum: Medicare for the ‘elder-
ly and grants and loans for college stu-
dents.

And what about Bill Ravotti’s attacks
on Coyne’s voting record and age?

“Someone who’s never cast one vote
shouldn’t criticize someone who’s accu-
mulated a record,” said Coyne, adding
Ravotti, 30, has never held a political
office of any kind. “Some people think
that a younger person could do a better
job. My experience makes me better than
youth and energy.”

Ravotti 

As a Republican, Ravotti is more than
familiar with his status as the underdog in
the race for the 14th district, a Democratic
stronghold. ..

“I’m running this race as Bill Ravotti
versus Bill Coyne,” said Ravotti. “If this
race is Democrat versus Republican, I’ll
lose.”

“Pittsburgh is largely Democrat, but
the people are very socially conservative,”

 

  mom PAGE 6 

said Ravotti, noting Coyne’s vote in favor
of partial-birth abortions. “Coyne is too
liberal for the democrats in this town. He
threw his Cath0lic—based voters into disar-
ray.”
Whatever the odds, Ravotti feels he
has Coyne “on the ropes.”
“Bill Coyne hasn’t given this area a
reason to vote for him, and that’s going to
cost him,” he said.
