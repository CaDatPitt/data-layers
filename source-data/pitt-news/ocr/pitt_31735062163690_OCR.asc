j Date Problems

By NANCY FUCHS

On the surface students at the
Bradford regional campus are or-
ganized in a classless society — a
phenomenon in the political and
educational spheres of today.. In
a college with only one upper-

, classman, a sophomore, the stu-

dents do not have anyone “older

and wiser” to show them what
college expects of them and to
stimulate their interest in activi-

. ties.

Students can be divided into
three groups: local students fresh
from high school, older local stu-
dents (some married)-.who have
worked since high school or at-
tended another college for a while,
and out-of—towners.

To complicate their situation of
being the only class there is a
top-heavy ratio of men to women
students. In a day-time student
body of 120, there are only 20
women. A college where men out-
number women ﬁve to one may
sound ideal to most women stu-
dents unfamiliar with such a sit-
uation, but Bradford women dis-
agree.

No Dances

The fact is, according to’ one
female student, “We would not
even try to hold a dance. We’d
have to bring in high school girls
or girls from other coleges.” The

not take enoughpride in their ap-
pearance since they know every
woman student and do not need to
impress anyone.

Perhaps to counterbalance this
negative feeling, Jerry Whalen,
assistant to President Swarts,
has ordered that all male resi-
dent students who eat dinner in
the school to wear coats and
ties, an d women students,
dresses‘. .

‘of the sexes. Besides sharing the
unpopularity of local male college
students, with high school boys,‘
common to any small town, he has
a problem of adjustment. As a

Great Shock

“They came from sophisticated
northeastern cities and found a
typical small town with little ex-

‘ citement. For some, the shock was

too great. They were not interest-
ed in starting activities because
their entertainment had always
been provided for them. On week-
ends they started to go to a little
border town like Limestone which
has a few bars.

A student from Boston who
had applied to the University
had been told to go to Bradford
sumed up his feelings in these
words about the change from
Eastern city life to small town
life: “Boston is proper, but this
is ridiculous.”

However, he is one of the resi-
dent students who is taking an ac-
tive interest in setting up activi-
ties. A local student feels the sit-
uation is improving. “They are
gradually waking up and trying to
start things. The ball is starting
to roll."

cation are held in one building.
According to one student, “there

Dr. Paul A. Weiss, head of the Department of Developmental

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

,5

A very engaging and highly entertaining Italian comedy
is currently being shown at the Guild Theater in Squirrel
Hill. The ﬁlm is called “To Bed . . . or Not to Bed” and it
stars one of the Italian cinema’s favorite comedians, Alberto
Sordi. Signor Sordi has attracted a vast audience in the
United States and he is always at the head of the list of for-
eign -performers appearing on American motion picture
screens. His fans in the country will not be disappointed in
the comic’s latest effort;

The ﬁlm takes the viewer on a trip to Sweden, which in

_itself is a rarity for Italian comedies or for any foreign

comedies. Usuallya French or Italian ﬁlm will be made in
their particular country about a situation or person of that
nation. The idea of an Italian -fur salesman taking a trip to
Sweden and meeting with many complications is cause
enuogh for something different for foreign ﬁlm-buffs. This
comedy was made by Italians all and the entire supporting
cast is Swedi_sh. Only Sordi is not of Swedish stock and the
placing of the comedian in such a situation is the starting
point for many amusing occurrances. ‘ ‘
DIFFERENCE IN SOCIETIES ,

Deeper, I feel, than the idea of an Italian fur dealer
going to Sweden for a sale is the fact of the difference in
societies between the two nations. Sordi’s imagination and a
travel folder bring on an image of a nation that is_complete—
ly free —— an earthly paradise. It is here that one can ﬁnd
beautiful girls at every street corrrer or railroad station. It
is -here where religion is thrown to athe wayside and morals
run rampant. Sex is the way of life and to hell‘ with re-
ligion or morals! Naturally thrown against this Swedish
view of life is Sordi’s Italian view. There the morals and
freedoms are dominated by a Catholic Church whose dom-
inance stands inlthe way of everything not in line with
church views. -

Theconﬂict is one of two societies that gamble for this
innocent salesman who has let his imagination run wildand
who, for the minute, has become lost in the aura of the
exotic Swedish way of life. He is disillusioned throughout
the ﬁlm by the many beauties whom he tries to seduce,’but
who always seems to be too young or in a hurry to get
somewhere else than Sordi’s hotel room. It is a very cute
situation but it would be -plasphemous for the picture to
reach any other conclusion than it does. Sordi goes back to
Italy, of course, and the last works out of his mouth are
“Dearest Anna . . ”, which refer to his wife. Once again the
Church has triumphed and the basically good and faithful
husband returns to the womb where he rightfully belongs.

- FULL OF BELLY-LAUGHS

To Bed . . . or Not to Bed is not a ﬁlm for the person who
likes his belly-laughs. This has none of the hearty hilarity of
a Big Deal on Madonna Street or a Divorce-Italian-style. The
hilarity here is very subtle and the situations plus the expres-
sions on Sordi’s face after" each failure to prove alluring to
the Swedish dolls provide the many moments of subtle and
ironic humor. It is a well-photographed ﬁlm and the scenes
of snowy Sweden are a beautiful visual exercise. There is
also a ﬁne background score that is better than most foreign
ﬁlm scores and a majority of American ﬁlms. The direction
and acting by the Swedes is very sharp and bright.

Sordi is one of the ﬁne talents of screen comedy whose
[gifts are on full display in this Dino DeLaurentis production.
Sordi has a_style familiar to Fernandel, Red Skelton, and
Toto, another funny Italian actor. Sordi, I believe, is an
actor ﬁrst and then a comedian. He realizes his situation

. and then does his best with the script and dialogue given to

him. There is a Wonderful engaging quality about his work
and To'Bed . .’ . or Not to,Bed is the type of enjoyable and
diﬁerent comedy that everyone who appreciates a ﬁne’ comic

- actor and his talents will ﬁnd thoroughly entertaining.

Angel Flight Provides Caried

Services For Campus, City
BY JACKI KATZ

Many campus organizations are social ones, many are
educational, and many are service; but Angel Flight, a na-
tional organization of undergraduate college women, is all
three. In addition, the women are associate members of
Arnold Air‘ Society, an honorary society for members of
‘Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps. '

0

Organized on the national level:

in 1957 and at the Universityin
1958, the members work for sev-
eral charity organizations such as
the March of Dimes, Heart Fund,
and the School for. the Blind, ac-
cording to Georgia Petras,’second
in command of the University
chapter.

Proceeds from the Arnold Air-
Angel Flight booth at tomorrow
night’s Winter Weekend Carnival
will go to the March of Dimes.

Learn Military

Most of the educational experi-
ences of the Angels, as the mem-
bers are called, center around the
military. “We try to learn more
about the Air Force through films,
literature, and discussions,” Miss
Petras said. “Detatchment officers
and professors of air science lead
the discussions.”

Socially, there are coffee
hours, events with Arnold Air,
and they also hostess for Armed

Forces Day atthe Airport. The

next social event will be next

Thursday at noon. Any person

interested in becoming an Angel

is welcome to attend, according

to Miss Petras. .

Before a person can become a
member of Angel ﬂight, she must
go through a pledge period, during
which time she must pass a pledge
board. In order to pledge, prospec-
tive members must have a mini-
mum‘ 2.0 Q.P.A.

National Conclave‘

Most of the lawmaking is done
at the national conclave which
will be in Denver, Colorado some-
time this summer. On the local
level, there is the area conclave
,whose headquarters this year will
be at the Pittsburgh Hilton. The
conclave will be held/ at the end
of February. \

 What the World Needs . . .

 New Zoo Keeper

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Alumni Hall smells like a zoo after the keepers have
fed the animals, but before they have cleaned the cages.
The ventilation stinks. So does the building. ‘Literally.

, Worse than the smell of Alumni Hall, however, are
the dangerous working conditions in the -
organic chemistry labs. Most of the ex-
‘, periments involve poisonous or explosive -5
~ gases. Despite the potential danger, few f
 preventive measures have yet been taken 
to remedy the, situation. ,‘

Because of the lack of preventive
equipment, such as ventilating hoods, any ,
gases generated by the experiment are re- ‘
leased into the room. This means inﬂam-
mable gases ﬂoat around Bunsen burners,
' and poisonous gases drift around students’ nostrils.
These poor conditions have already resulted in‘
3,.‘ several near disasters. » '

5 One of these accidents occurred three weeks ago.in
 a Saturday organic chemistry lab. The experiment involved
the use of ether, a highly flammable gas. The students

were instructed before the experiment to keep all "seals
’ tight, but the lack of good equipment and the human error

3

n_made this precaution virtually impossible.

  The inevitable happened. ‘The ether came close to. a
. , ﬂame. It ignited. Fire danced on the table. Flames burned
on the ﬂoor. The back of a student’s’lab coat caught ﬁre.
"Blut the ﬁre was put out without much trouble or cause for
a arm. » -
». Afterwards one of the assistants commented. “It
_ wasn’t thestudents’ fault. That could have happened to
ilmgst anyone. It wouldn’t have happened at all with a
oo .’ .
‘ Potentially dangerous experimentsare carried out
each week. A bad seal, or a cracked ﬂask from over--2

I have been a student in this institution for
nearly four years now, and have come to regard
classes as a necessary and not very exciting evil.
I have taken over 40 courses in my tenure and
have had nearly as many different instructors.
Some of the courses were provocative and worth-
while, and some were not. To a great extent, it
was the instructors who taught those courses who
decided for me whether it was going to be a good
course, a mediocre one, or one to cut twice a-

, week. I have had coursesin all three categories.
Unfortunately, the majority were much less than
I had expected and even the best of instructors
were never at top form all of the time. This, of
course, is to be expected, for a professor can never
throw himself into a topic three times a week
with complete abandon at each session. In fact, it
is a rare occasion ‘whena professor can hold a
class spellbound for even the prescribed 50 min-
utes of one period..

I had come to accept this situation as natural,
never really having experienced true dynamism
in the classroom and never really expecting it.
Even the best of lectures by the best of instruc-
tors quite often "drove me to doodling in my
notebook. One might call it classroom condi-
tioning; each class has ‘a normal curve‘of pro-.
vocativity, and no professor ever varies to any
great extent from his standard trae of interest

_ value. '

One day "a professor might be more interesting
than the day before, but usually not by very
much, and one could generally tell by the end of
the third week of the term how each daily lecture
was going to go. v

This wasmy general impression of this school
-— some classes interesting, but never to a great
extent, and some horribly dull, often to a great

extent — until, that is, the day before yesterday. I

On that day, Dr. Robert G. Colodny, associ-

‘ lEllER . . .

Education Edit Hit

 

By Matthew Swetonic

ate professor of history and one of the more
talked about instructors in this institution, came

into my regularly schednuled History 118 class .

to deliver a lecture on the Spanish Civil War.
Our regular instructor had-told us at the be-
ginning of’ the term that he had asked Dr.
Colodny to come in and lecture on that particu-
lar part of modern European history when we
came to it because he was particularly well
acquainted with the topic and was much more
qualiﬁed than he was to discuss it with us.

— The were a ‘signiﬁcant number of outsiders
sitting in that day, and for 50 minutes the entire

_class sat almost spellbound as Dr. Colodny pre-

sented us with his picture of the great struggle
in Spain. - 1

It was, beyond any question of a doubt, the
finest hour I have ever spent in any ‘class in my
four years at the University of Pittsburgh.

Dr. Colodny was not spectacular. .He did not
jump around or pound on the desk as some pro-
fessors have been known to do trying to drive
home a point. He just stood there with his hands
folded across his stomach and talked. Sometimes
he paced a bit but that was all. ‘

‘Very few students even attempted to take
notes. That would have been sacreligeous. It is
-virtually impossible to describe the dynamic, al-
most emotional quality, of that lecture. However,
let it suffice to say that it was magniﬁcent.

~When Dr. Colodny had ﬁnished speaking the
entire‘ room burst into applause —- the ﬁrst time
I have ever seen that happen in my four years
here. ' , q
I cannoft speak for the quality of Dr. Colodny’s
lectures in his regular classes, never -having taken
a course from him, however he shall forever re-

main in my mind as the professor who provided A‘

me with my ﬁnest hour as a student at this Uni-
versity — for this I am‘ deeply grateful. '

Editor, The. Pitt News: ,'

 

Editor, The Pitt -News:

In your editorial on educa-
tion (The Pitt News, February
3, 1964) you assert:

1. The ,80 and 180 courses
only “dish "out insigniﬁcant
doses of material to students

who have‘ no interest in 80 ,

‘percent of the work.”

2. The Phi Eta Sigma tutor-
ing program “shows an under-
standing of the foolishness of
the distribution program as it
now stands.” .

3. The ‘study improvement’
program sponsored by the

Dean of Men’s office “will ’

teach students, how to pass a
course, without learning any-
thing.”

For these items you cite no
supporting evidence. I cannot
agree with any, of the asser-
tions. Item one seems much
too categorical. In my per-
sonal experience, Introduction
to I-Iumanities 81, as taught
by Professor William C. Pan-
etta, and "Introduction to the
Social Sciences 85, as taught

by Professor Leonard I. Kunst,‘

have been the two most stim-
ulating and broadening courses
in my four years at the Uni-
.versity, ‘
The second assertion is de-

monstrably false. As president
of Phi "Eta Sigma, I can re-
port -that our tutoring program
is in no way a» response to
the 80 and 180 courses. Tutor-
ing is most in demand for:

‘biology 11, chemistry 11 and
-12, and mathematics 21, 22,

and 23.~ These science‘ courses
require intensive stu dy and

metnorization.‘~The 80 and 180.

courses, ‘by contrast, require
extensive reading and indepen-
dent conceputal synthesis on
the part of each student. Thus
the distribution courses do not
require intensive drill which
is intrinsic in group tutoring.

Item three seems based on
the premise th a t systematic.

. study makes the pursuit of_
knowledge impossible. In my

personal experience this is
absurd. . —

You oppose and strike out at

' the narrow minded strict‘ utili-
tarianism which regards the

search for truth as idealistic
nonsense. In this -dedication I

admire and support you. Yet

I cannot agree that the 80 and
180 courses are, in any way, ‘a
manifestation of such anti-in-.

_ tellectualism.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Student Blasts American
.Views on Negro Equality

Much has appeared in paper
and magazines which has called
for the equality of the American
Negro. I, too, wish to call out for
equality. At present, the Ameri-
'can Negro does not have equal-
ity with -his fellow Americans.
He has dominance over them.
Having neither the responsibility
nor competence for a new way
of life, the Negroes demand to
be given, not an, equal place, but
a better place than his white
counterpart. The Negro is the

man who has won a haughty‘

victory over his white subordin-
ates.-

So fearful have the white
Americans become of the Neg-
roes’ new power that in Phila-
delphia a police officer was sus-
pended for shooting a Negro in
self-defense while in the line of
duty. SO forceful is the NAACP
that, aga.in in Philadephia, a
plumbers’ union was compelled
by law to hire two Negro plumb-
ers. The demand may not seem
very unjust, but it remains a fact
that no two.NegrOes could be
found that were able to do the
job. The NAACP ﬁnally discov-
ered two colored men whom they
felt could handle the jOb’s re-
quirements. Not so. By the next
day one of the men had been
ﬁred as totally incompetent.- The
NAACP said nothing contrary. If
two Negro men could not be found
to do the job, why should two
capable white men not be allowed
to work? Because men are white
is no reason to forbid them to
work.

Even the most respected busi-

‘ nesses must succumb to the wiles

of one Negro employee. Saks Fifth
Avenue Company in New York
employs a surely, disrespectful
Negro woman as a package
wrapper. She has infuriated many
customers and lost many more,

_/and yet the company cannot fire

her. She is a Negro and has the
power of NAACP demonstrations
behind her. A respected insurance
company in Philadelphia w a s
forced by the NAACP to hire ten

percent Negro employees. The.

commond was fulﬁlled by law.
One of the new Negro employees
comes late to work every day,
and laughs about it. He takes ex-
tended coﬁee breaks and dis-
rupts both the morale and ef-
ﬁciency of the entire company.
Yet, the company cannot ﬁre the
man because it fears the unjust
harm of the NAACP. ‘
that these
examples of a few individuals
are not representative of all Ne-
groes. I will agree. I am not
against offering equal job oppor-
tunities to equally capable people.
What I am violently opposed to

 

‘I

is the fact that these particular
people cannot either be ﬁred or
made to work for their company
without injury to the company
by representational groups of Ne-
groes. It is impossible for a com-
pany to work efficiently when its
leader must be controlled by
threat from a few in subordinate
jobs. If a white man were in-
competent. or hazardous to the
harmony of a company, he ‘would
be ﬁred. I believe that Negroes
should be given the same equal-
ity void of thatthreat of harm
to the company they now have.

For the same reasons, I feel
strongly that the white Ameri-
can should have an equal chance
to live with whom he chooses.
Why should a white American be
forced to accept a Negrohor any

other person as his neighbor? A

.man’s home and his community,
in America, ‘should have some
form of democratic rule. If the
majority of a community are
against permitting a family, be
it white or colored, to live in
that community, then that fam-
ily should not be allowed to
move in. It is the right. of a

_community to decide who shall

and shall not live in it, and to
some extent how he shall live
in it. ' ,

There are, by the way, very
real bsaes _ for the fear of run
down neighborhoods .where col-
ored people move. I live not too
far from a town called Chester.
It is about the size of Johnstown,
40,000. When I was younger the
city was predominately white and
in fairly good‘ condition. Today
Chester is a predominately col-
ored city, and very run down.
I am not certain of the cost of
a few nails, to fasten loose boards
or of a bucket of paint to re-
place old, peeling paint, but I am
sure that the combined costs are
less than that of a new car, or
new additions of junk to old cars,
or even less than a ﬁfth or two
a week —' the latter three all
too present in Chester. Having

-.~this picture of decayed Chester

in my mind, why should I not
cringe when a colored man from
Chester tries to move A into my

community? Lack of money is

not‘ the sacker of Chester, either.
White people earning compar-
able wages not only keep up their
property, but send their children
to college.

It. is also a myth that Negro
studentsrcannot get into colleges
when they. want to. Just look
around our campus. As for the
South, there are many, many
beautiful campuses with new and
efﬁcient buildings that far sur-
pass -our Own. ‘The teachers are
doctors ‘graduated from Harvard
or other comparable universities.
Yet, these_ colleges are for Ne-
groes "only. I have heard of no
move to integrate these Negro
colleges.

,The._COmmittee urged “drastic. changes in present ways of ful-

 to?-.th9i:r performance-’i;

ﬁlling degree requirements” to make "it easier for the “presumably
intelligent and highlymotivated” woman to return to her education
after many years of absence. Every degree candidate has to cover a
certain amount of material, the committee pointed out, but “what
need not be constant and invariable . . . is the means by whichthe
expected» knowledge and skills are required.”

“Full-time attendance requirements ought to be dropped in some
cases,” the committee said, “and more independent study techniques
adopted — such as television courses, programmed learning, assigned
readings. and tutorial conferences.” Also suggested was the scheduling
of required courses “at hours which are convenient for women with
domestic responsibilities,” such as in mid-morning and early afternoon.

The committee decided that “Married women should be al-
lowed to pay tuition charges on an installment basis, loan funds
should be made available to part-time women students, and
“women who qualify for fellowships "should be allowed to hold
them on a part-time basis.” The latter is not allowed at present.

The report urged that data be collected “on the motivations,
academic ‘backgrounds, and domestic circumstances” Of women tak-

grating s c h o O l s in Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, a nd many other
places. The result is ridiculous.
A white man must send his child

-literally miles from home so that

a school serving an all Negro
community may become integrat-
ed. A Negro family must send
its many children far from home
so that an all white school may
be integrated. When parents com-
plained of the absurdity of the
new system in Philadelphia, the
Negroes forced the school board
to completely redistrict, unprac-
tically, all Philadelphia schools.
The havoc and inconvenience was
not met; it was ignored.

What is the result when inte-
gration in scho Ols is accom-
plished? A recent article in The
Pitt News inquired into the pos-
sibility of segregation in the
Tuck Shop. It seems‘ that all or
most of the Negro students sit
in but one small section of the
shop. The reason? They want to
be together. They do not want.to
associate with the whites. Then
why force them to? The Negroes
have their rights; their freedom
of choice should be upheld.

We live in what we call a de-
mocracy in which all men are
free. By deﬁnition we live, by
our consent, in a society where
the will of the majority is law.
Granted this majority is falable,
but neither is a minority infal-
able. Democracy does not mean
control by a minority group. It
does not mean that what a mi-

nority feels should be elimin--
ated from our society must be”,

done "away with.

However, Mummers with
painted black faces are different.
The Negroes felt that after more
than sixty years these painted
Mummers suddenly became an in-
sult to their race. A Negro de-
monstration was planned against
the entire Mummers’ Parade and
was far more Of an insut to the
integrity of the Negro people
than any clowns with their faces
painted either white or black.
Even ’mOre Of an insult to the
Negro race was the demonstra-
tion by Negroes against the Lib-
erty Bowl football game in Phil-
adelphia. No_Negroes were play-
ing in that game. However, the
game was dedicated to a Negro

football player who had played .
‘there previously and who had

recently died. The. late p1ayer’s

fellow Negroes, would not permit .‘

a game to be played in his honor.

Another smarting affront to the
Negro people is the fact that
a -new law had to be passed
in their behalf, stating that af-
ter her third illegitimate child a

mother must give the name of
the father. The law was passed ,

because too“ many Negro women
and I know many personal ex-
amples, had illegitimate _children
to receive more welfare aide from
the government. ,
And what do Negroes think of
other minority groups like them-

selves? Perhaps you will re'mem— .

her reading a story as a child
entitled Little Black Sambo., You
will not ﬁnd it on the market
today. It has been changed to
the story about a little red In-
dian. Apparently the Negroes are

not ﬁghting for the equality of -

all American minority groups.
In fact, they do not even want
equality. That would be a de-
gradation from the present dom-

inant position they hold.

Referees Steal Show

By ART FLEISCHNER
The West Virginia basketball team couldn’t have lost to the
Panthers Wednesday night even if they wanted to. The)’ 1}ad
more things in their favor than the Beatles. They were playing
at home It was the 100th meeting between» the two schools and
the state of West Virginia’s centennial. _, _ ‘
They also had two men in black and‘ white stripped shirts
named Dallas Shirley and W. J. Cassidy. As a result Pitt last,
86-84, and dropped their record to 13-6. _ i
The 6300 fans at the game heard’ more whistles than a
I country driver tying up traﬁic on Broadway. _ The Sam? W35
" stopped more times than Floyd Patterson. The only continuous
performance of the evening was given by Paton twirl” Linda
Martha at halftime. Linda is the sister of Pitt's Paul Martha.
Brian Generalovich broke a DCPSOMJ record by Scoring
19 points and going over the 1000 mark. Generalovich is
the ﬁfth Pitt player to do so and now has a total of.10l1.
Shirley, and Cassidy also broke a Mountaineer Field House
record. Between them they called 68 fouls, ﬁve more than the
previous high. Pitt was charged with 36 personals, four more
than West Virginia. - ,
Panther coach Bob Timmons said, “‘It was a ﬁne game. Im
only sorry it had to end with so many of the best players on
both teams no the bench. Up our way the oﬂicials permit. a
team to play a little more basketball. Those inconsequential
fouls, which have no bearing on the game, only slow it up and
spoil the real basketball. Unless they are deliberate or ﬂagrant,
there shouldn’t be so many fouls called.”
Center Paul Krieger left the game with 10:27 left. 
was followed by Generalovich at 8:35, Dave Sauer at 7:03.
and Bob Lovett at 5:42. Sauer said llpoﬂleaving. “I did!”
play enough basketball to ﬁll one quarter.”-
Both of the officials were from the Southern Conference of
T which West Virginia is a member. Cassidy tried his best to-stay
out of thespotlight, but when it comes to attention, Shirley got
more than Cassius Clay. ~ '
 “They were both good referees,” said Timmons, “the only
trouble was that I’ don’t think Shirley could see.”

Swim Team Travels to Bucknell
Seek 4th Win in Seven Tries

The Panther swimming team will have to be at their
best when it visits Bucknell tomorrow if they hope to im-
prove on their 3-3 record.

The Bisons are coached by Bob Latour, who, in the

-seven years since he initiated the sport at Bucknell, has compiled a
’ record of 51 victories against only 17 defeats. In the past four seasons,

Bucknell has won the Middle Atlantic Conference championship twice
and ﬁnished runncrup the other two years.

Since 1956, they have not won ' it 
less than six meets or lost more
than three in any single season

Buckne_ll’s top stars are jun-

 

hails from nearby Mt. Lebanon,
and sophomore breast - stroker
Phil Reynolds. Smigie is un-
defeated in 20 college dual
meets in the 200-yard butter-
ﬂy. He defeated Ron Levine
last year in a dual meet, but
then ﬁnished fourth, one spot
behind Levine in the Eastern
Championships. Thus their dual
tomorrow should be the high-

Reynolds has won the 2O0-yard :
breaststroke in seven of eight:
meets so far this year. Othe
Bucknell standouts are freesytl-
ers Jery Thimme, Townley Lar-
zelere and Bruce Dove and co-
captain John Weinmann in the
individual medley.

The Bisons have compiled an
8-1 record so- far this season.
Both the Panthers and Bucknell
have had meets with Colgate and
Syracuse with the same results-
Both squads beat Syracuse, but
lost to Colgate’s Red Raiders.

The Panther’s, 62-33, loss at
Colgate was the worst dealt to
them in over two years. Bucknell

Tomorrow

Panthers
Must Stop  
Richards

By BOB SMIZIK
Panther basketball coach
Bob Timmons ﬁgures that
his team will have to stop

S y r a c u s e center 'Chuck
Richards when the two teams
meet tomorrow at 2:45 p.m. at
the Field House in a game which
the Panthers must win if they
are to stay in the running for
an NCAA tournament berth.

“We've got to keep the ball
away _from Richards,” Timmons
said. “Much of their offense is
based around him, and if we
can keep the ball away from
him We’ll be okay.”

The Panthers .couldn’t keep
the ball away from Richards
when‘ the two teams met last
Saturday although it was ‘not for
lack of trying. The Panthers’
two centers, Paul Krieger and
Bob Lovett, fouled out while
watching Richards that day as
the 6-foot-8 star scored 34
points. .

“I like to have our centers
pla.y«in front _of a player like
Richards, who plays the low
pivot,” said Timmons, “but
they just couldn't do it the
last time we played. We’ll use”
the same strategy tomorrow
and hope it works out better.”.

Richards isn't the only threat
that the Orange have, Dave
Bing, a standout
scored -23 points against the

Panthers. “Syracuse either gets

the ball to Richards or tries to
set up Bing,” Timmons said.

“Bing is a real ﬁne ball player.”

Timmons will have other
worries besides Bing and Rich-
ards. One will be to keep his
centers in the ball game. Both
also fouled out against West Vir-
ginia last Wednesday. Lovett
after only playing nine minutes
a mark Dink Larkin. would be
proud of.

Krieger has accumulated 73
fouls in 18 games, which is
' better than four a game. Tim-
mons calls Richards “a boy
who either gets the shot or the
foul,” so Krieger may be in
for more foul trouble tomor-
row;

One player Timmons won’t
have _to worry about tomorrow is
Larkin. "Dink injured his knee

in a freak accident While walk- '

ing and aggravated an old in-
jury. He may be out for the sea-
son. — ‘

Tomorrow’s game will be the
second part of a_ doubleheader
with Carnegie Tech and Du-
quesne meeting in the opener at
1:30 p.m.

' E Toughest Foes Yet To Come

_Two Wrestlers Unbeaten

 

r,

Panther: Wrestlers Successful

Things looked pretty hopeless for the Panther
wrestling squad as the season opened. Tim Gay
and Bill Buchanan were on scholastic probation.
John Carr and Dave Clery failed out of school.
With four stars lost, it
seemed like an impos-
sible situation even for
the magician, Rex

‘Peery.

In the last few
meets, however, the
Panthers have im-

proved so. much that
they are rated one of
the best in the East.
Their next ‘two meets
are against Lehigh and

REX PEERY Penn State, two of the
powers of Eastern‘ Collegiate wrestling, and
these matches will determine the Panthers’
classiﬁcation.

One of the stalwarts who has really passed
Peery with his wrestling is Duff Killian, 123-
pounder, who has taken the spot away from last
year's starter, Tom Heniff. His most spectacular
win was in his match with Warren Chow, highly
rated Cornell matman.

 

l)esp,ite Early Season Difficulties

Mike Johnson, 130-pounder, is the team cap-
tain, and he usually makes his opponents follow
orders as well. He scored his first pin» of the
season last Saturday against Michigan State.

‘‘It has really made a difference to have
Frank O’Korn at 137 pounds,” said Peery.
(5’l{orn has not lost at his new weight division
and has now taken three straight wins.

Dino Boni, the team’s 147-pounder, has only
been defeated once this season and Peery be-
lieves he should be undefeated. “He was leading

. into the last period but somehow he managed to

lose it.”

Tom Baily has also been consistent at 157
pounds. He has won all four home matches
while losing all three away meets. “I’m trying
to get the Eastern championships moved here so
Baily will have a chance,” quipped Peery.

Clair Riley has moved up 30 pounds from his
normal weight to ﬁll in at 167 pounds, while

"Lee Hall, at 177 pounds, sports’ a record which

speaks for itself. He is undefeated so far this
season and pulled out a last second victory with
a takedown against Emerson Boles, of Michigan
State. ‘

Ken Barr has come on lwellsince his knee"

operation, compiling a 2-2 record.

THERE'S A WIDE RANGE or OPiPOiRTUNlTY

To outer space and into the deep sea, we take the sum
total of our scientific and managerial knowledge. A case
in point is Telstar, which represents the first step toward
a worldwide communications system. Another example,
the new deep-sea amplifier that simultaneously transmits
two-way messages. Both communications triumphs stem
from Bell System planning, research and development.

Such trailblazing. projects command the best of
managerial and scientific talent. That's why you'll find,
throughout the Bell System, men with college trainingas
diverse as the responsibilities they shoulder. Their back-
, grounds-run the gamut from liberal arts and business

-tovscience or specialized‘ en meerm ma rs

Admittedly, the work is demanding. it requires that
unusual caliber of man who finds a greater satisfaction in
challenge than in ready solution . . . who iseager to see his
education yield dividends . . . who wants an immediate
opportunity for leadership.

Men with this kind of impatience will discover the‘
stimulation, welcome and rewards they seek in the tele-.
phone business. ~
