  To Clothier
Yet Named

 

March 1; ‘Is Elected
, Head of Rutgers

 

'. No. successor to Robert C. Cloth-
ier, dean of men, who on Tuesday
was elected president of Rutgers
University, ha-s been yet consider-
ed, according to an announcement
made ,yestei_'day by Chancellor
'fJ=o,'hn ‘G. Bowman.

x "We congratulate Mr. Clothier
upon the position which has been
extended to him, and we wish him

well in his new associations," said
Dr. Bowman. “At the same time,
how-ever,,we can only regret his
leaving _the University where he
has done such splendid service dur-
ing the past three years. No thought
has yet been given to his succes-
sor.”

It may be presumed that if a suc-

-Clothier leaves on March 1, that
the work of the office of the dean
of men will be conducte at least
temporarily, by Theodore W. Bid-

ter J. Rome, graduate manager of
student activities.

As the word spread on the Rutgers
campus in the afternoon the bell in
old Queen's Hall was rung by stu-
dents and the 1766 ﬂag run up on
the campus pole. Rutgers has been
without a president since October,
1930, when Dr. John M. Thomas
resigned to enter business.

Philip M. Brett, acting president,
reached Dean Clothier by telephone
at Wesleyan University, Middle-
town, Conn., yvhere he was visiting
friends, and informed him of the
election. _

Dean Clothier came to Pitt in
where he had served as assistant
headmaster. Since assuming his
work here, Mr. Clothier has grad-
ually re-organized the office of the
dean of men until it has become
the point of contact between the
administration and all men stu-
dents enrolled in the University.
He has been particularly active in
lnterfraternity relations and has
established an adequate supervision
over undergrad-uate activities.

.Mvr. Clothier attended Haverford
School, and was graduated in 1908
from Princeton University, where
he majored in political economy and
history. He was prominent in -stu-
dent activities and served as edi-
tor of the “Daily Princetonian,”
campus newspaper.

Aﬁer a year in newspaper work
he entered the service ‘of the Cur-
tis Publishing Company in Phila-
ldelphia, and subsequently became
employment manager. In 1917 he
was called to Washington as a
member of the committee on class-
iﬁcation of the personnel in the
army in the war department, and
was later sent overseas to study
the personnel procedures of the
British and French armies and to
establish liaison between the per-
sonnel work in the United States
and that in the A. E. F.; subse-
quently he was commissioned lieu-
tenant-colonel, general staff. In
this work he was associated with
President Walter Dill Scott of
Northwestern University; L. B.
Hopkins, now president of Wabash
College; Prof. E. L. Thorndike and
Prof. John J. Coss of Columbia,
and Walter V. Blngham, director of
the Personnel Research ‘Founda-

After the armistice he joined
With S00“. Hopkins and others in
organizingithe ‘Scott Company,‘ con-
sultants in industrial personnel. In
1923 he returned to the Haverford
Séhool as assistant headmaster,
and served as acting headmaster
during the sabbatical leave of Ed-
win M. Wilson in 1928-1929. In the
latter year he was called to the
University of Pittsburgh as dean of
men.

Fraternities

Break Rules

Phi Gams, Kappa Sigs

 

Receive Censure

 

Kappa Sigma and Phi Gamma
Delta, national social fraternities
on campus, have technically vio-
lated the university fraternity rules
this fan by initiating men into
their groups without ﬁrst securing
the approval of the office of the
Dean of Men. Members of the
Fraternity Committee, after care-
fully investigating the violation
and ﬁnding the men to be eligible
for initiation—hav-e decided that
publicizing the vi-olation will be in-
ﬂicting sufficient punishment. 1

The committee feels that the
health of the fraternity situation
on the Pitt campus depends upon
strict observance of the rules gov-
erning pledging and initiation, and
that the evidence therefor cannot
be overlooked. At the same time
the committee believes that in the
present instance it has not been
the ‘intention of either fraternity
to violate the rule. But the fact
that these students were eligible
for initiation does not alter the fact
that the fraternities were guilty of
a technical violation of the rules.”

The- violation of the rules re-
calls a similar violation made by a
fraternity last year. The man, in-
volved, however, was eligible for
initiation and the fraternity was
ﬁned twenty-ﬁve dollars. Later in
the year, two fraternities were
guilty of violating rushing rules and
each was ﬁned seventy-ﬁve dollars.

These fraternities were also
placed on probation for their action
and a representative appeared each
week at the Dean of Men's office
to report all the activities at the
fraternities. This probation period
for the fraternities ended just re-
cently.

will be passed on the spirit of the
group, the originality of the words,
the presentation of the song, the
originality of the music. It is not
necessary for the music to be orig-
inal but if it is, it should be writ-

Three rules are to be observed
by the sororities entering the con-
test. First, the song must not be
more than ﬁve minutes in length.
Second. there are not to be more
than eight girls in a group. Third,
the words which must be about the

Twenty selected singers,
representing the Women's and
Men's Glee Clubs, will attempt
to establish a tradition when
they meet today at 12:30 un-
der the clock in Alumni Hall
to present a program of Christ-
mas choral music.

This group will attempt to
revive the interest shown in
choral music in past years,
perhaps because students felt
that they would cheer them-
selves up during the hard
times. However, these sing-
ers hope, that in presenting
this program they are starting
a popular activity, a custom
which will endure.

Few campus students will
recall the last appearance of
the University -"mixed chorus
some four years ago. It is
hoped that this new select
group will initiate an interest
similar to that enjoyed by the
mixed chorus. It is hoped
that the student body will re-
spond favorably by giving
their attention and joining in
the prevailing spirit.

Relief Drive
Reaches End

for

 

Campus Donations
Miners Collected

   

Pitt’-s campaign for contributions
of food and clothes for the desti-
tiite miners in Western Pennsylva-
nia comes to a close today with
boxes of donations from students
awaiting shipment.

The drive was undoubtedly a
great success, meeting‘ the ap-
proval and co-operation of students
and faculty. Fraternities played
an active part last Monday, which
was designated as “Fraternity Do-
nation Day.” Some of the houses
contributed cases of food; many
dug into their wardrobes for coats,
hats, shoes, and even old “dinks.”
Welfare associations will gather
the supplies and distribute them
over the stricken area.

’Twas the night before—Friday—
when all through the ballroom
everything was stirring——even the
mistletoe. The little brown barn
elves were seated around,the ﬁre-
place toasting their toes before re-
turning to the country-side barns
for the winter. The lord and lady
of the manor dressed in their ﬁne
silks heavily laden with gold and
silver brocade and surrounded by
their noble guests await the arrival
of the Christmas Spirit.

Out of the night, led by the soft
strains of Christmas carols, comes
the Yul Bok, ancient Swedish ram
-and symbol of Yuletide Greeting,

bringing gifts to all the merry
guests.
After distributing his presents

and good will, the Bok disappears
as magically as he came. The lady,
by the side of her handsome lord
raises her hand in signal for her
vassals to clear the ﬂoor.

A moment later Jack Bruce and
his Court Musicians strike up a
lively tune and the lord and lady
step forth to lead their subjects in
the ,-royal promenade.

Pick Band
For Prom

 

Paul " Tremaine To Play;
" Open Ticket Sale

Paul Tremaine and his band
from “Lonely Acres,” nationally-
known recording and radio broad-
casting orchestra, will play for the
annual Junior Prom, Friday eve-
ning, January 15, it was announced
this week by Chairman Charles
G. Hugus, Jr., -Col.

Shortly after the announcement
Tuesday that this prominent mu-
iscal organization had been en-
gaged f-or the Prom, members of
the committee received their dou-
ble sets of tickets and recorded the
first sales that afternoon.

The plan of limiting the Junior
Prom to 300 couples by permit-
ting the reservation of tickets with
the payment of one dollar, and the
payment of the balance of $4.50
any time before the dance, met
with hearty approval on the cam-
pus this week.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, approved the plan insti-
tuted for the first time by this
year's prom committee, with the
statement:

“The limitation of the number
attending a class dance by reser-
vation of tickets is the ﬁrst -step
toward eliminating overcrowded
conditions at University social af-
fairs and serves the better pur-
pose, I believe, of creating a true
class spirt. I would even go so
far as to say that the ultimate end
should be a Junior Prom limited
to juniors only.”

Richard Phifer, Col. ’32, business
manager of the Owl and chairman
of last year’s Junior Prom, said:

“In the face of existing condi-
tions the plan offered by the pres-
ent. prom chairman and his com-
mittee is the most logical thing
that has been advanced yet for cur-
tailing overcrowdedness. It also
assures the chairman that his ex-
penses will be met-——that the dance
will be both a social and financial
success.”

Elaine Foraker, Col. ’32, associ-
ate editor of the Weekly and a
member of Senior Court, comment-
ed on the innovation in regulation
of social functions, saying:

“If we make reservations for a
casual evening's entertainment at
a theatre or restaurant, why not
for an affair as long anticipated
as the prom?”

Programs have already been se-
lected ‘for the Prom and favors will
be decided upon during the Christ-
mas recess. Members of the com-
mittee are conﬁdent that the deco-
rations and lighting effects will
surpass anything yet attempted for
a similar social affair.

Tickets may be purchased from
any member of the committee,
whose names appear on posters
now on all University bulletin
hoards, or from the office of the
graduate manager of student activ-

ities.

not get any real action until the
Notre Damegame, when he ran om
the tackles and hurdled the ends
so dexterously that he relegated
Josh Williams to the position of un-

He was the lightest man on th
squad during the past season,-
weighing only 156 pounds.

Turner Raps
Emotionalism

Economic Sides of Slump
Must Be Studied ,

“I am in sympathy with the,
movement, but I suggest that you
quit being emotional about miners?»
relief and survey the "whole situ-

ation,” said Dr. Ralph E. Turner,-’

associate professor of history, at a.
meeting of the Inquiry Club Wed-
nesday, December 16, speaking on
“Why Miners’ Relief?”

“It is better to approach relief
as a function of the economic sys-
tem rather than from a sentimen-
tal viewpoint," Dr. Turner con-
tinued. The fact that business de-
pressions, causing the misery, oc-
cur in cycles is of greater-import
ance than immediate relief.

A reconstruction of the economic
system to eliminate business cycles
is necessary. Some way of taking
care of excess production and capi-
tal must be found, since capitalism
can only operate in a continually
expanding market. “We have
reached the point where we can't,
expect anything other than spas-
modic recovery." -,

Noted Baritone Movie Star Prefers Operatic Stage To
Invisible Audience of Silver Screen

 

By DAVID ROGERS
~ “The opera, in my opinion, has been losing popularity
largely because it has not changed with the times,” stated Law-
rence Tibbett, said to be the ﬁnest baritone in America, and a

ranking movie star, when I asked him about opera.

Mr. Tib-

bett, since his sensational story-book debut a few years ago in
“Falstaﬁ,” has been generally spoken of as the greatest actor

on the present day operatic stage.

A
V

to my question.

‘The theater-going public de-
mands life and color and action in
its entertainment. The music of
-the old masters will always be
great, but the production and the
acting of them can stand improve-
ment. Personally, I enjoy operatic
work. There is a great satisfaction
for the accomplished singer in the
test of the voice and skill to the ut-
most.”

“As a matter of fact‘, however, I
have also thoroughly enjoyed all of
my motion picture work. It has
been something of a novelty for
me, you see. I miss the visible au-
diences, of course, but I have rec-
onciled myself with the thought
that my work can be more widely
heard through the medium of the
film. Motion picture work is hard
and exacting, but . . . I like it.”

The baritone is quite a football
fan. Like most people who have
lived in the vicinity of Pasadena,
California, he professes an ardent
admiration for the Trojans of
Southern California. He has -seen
the Golden Panthers play one game,
and that was the Tournament of
Roses game. January 1, 1930.

“I don't have the opportunity 0
seeing as much football as I won
like to see,” Mr. Tibbet said. "He
then went on to explain that his
concert engagements and the great
amount of travel they involve, not
to mention his many hours of pr.ac-
tice, usually manage to occupy
most of his time.

“Before a concert I spend the day
mostly in lounging about. I do not
sing a note from any song, I do vo-
callze, however, in order to get my
voice in trim for the evening's
work. It is merely a principle of
warming up the vocal chords, so to
speak. I do it something like this!’

He turned to the piano and went.
through a short: series of vocal
gymnastics. His glorious voice
sounded sweeter to me than ever
before. I am biased, of course.
Why not? I was the entire audi-
ence.

‘'0 course,” Mr. Tibbett continued
as he rose and stood with his back
to the piano, ‘‘I go through a much
more complicated series of exer-
cises than I have sung for you.
They really can be very boring to a

listener, and they certainly do not

Doctor Hovde Lectures
At Seminar Meeting

Last Friday, Dr. Byrnjolf J.
Hovde, associate professor of his-
tory, addressed the Social Science
Seminar meeting in the Faculty
Club rooms in the basement of the

‘Schenley Hotel. After a very com-

plete analysis of “Some of the
Eﬁects of Emmigration on the
Scandinavian Countries," Dr.
Hovde answered questions which
arose in the minds of the audi-
ence, during the reading of his
paper.

These round-table discussions
are always helpful toward the com-
plete understanding of the papers
which at first may seem scholarly
or technical to those specializing
in other ﬁelds than the speaker.

Speciﬁc directions for the new
system of mid-semester registration
were announced today by John G.
Quick, registrar of the University.
Registration begins immediately
after the return from Christmas
vacation on January 4.

The registration of classilﬂed stu-
dents in the College and Schools of
Engineering, Mines, Business Ad-
ministration and Education will be
conducted during the period ex-
tending from January 4 to 23. This
is not pre-registration. It is a ﬁnal
enrollment procedure, and is not
subject to subsequent alteration
except with the special premission
of the dean of the school concerned.
All qualiﬁed students will be ex-
pected to complete their registra-
tion within the time speciﬁed, so
that it may n-ot be necessary for
them to report at the Mosque dur-
ing the interim between semesters.
On Monday and Tuesday, February
1 and 2, the Mosque will be open
‘for the registration of new fresh-
men, and others whose cases have
been deferred until that time.
The details of the procedure are
as follows:——

a. During the Christmas re-
cess permits to register will be
mailed to the students con-
cerned.

b. On January 4, 5 and 6
study lists will be distributed

Sixty Musicians Attend
Concert Band Practice

 

The University Concert Band be-
gan its yearly activities by staging
its initial rehearsal last Tuesday
night. "Coach M. S. Rocereto se-
lected the sixty concert musicians
from the 120 men that made up the
marching organization. '
Coach Rocereto is preparing a
varied program of marches, over-
tures, medleys and classical and
semi-classical music that will be
played by the band at all of its
concerts. Tentative plans call for
the appearance of the Band at
several neighboring cities, includ-
ing Uniontown, Erie and Greens-
burg.

Coach Rocereto expects this
year to have the ﬁnest concert
band he has ever had at the Uni-
versity. He bases this prediction
on the fact that he has at his dis-
posal some of the ﬁnest musicians
ever to have registered at Pitt.

A writer in the Penn State Collegian lizfs proved through compara-
tive scores that Penn State is 35 points better than Pitt. His ﬁgures
show that State beat Lehigh, 31-0; and the latter won over Princeton.
19-7 conditions which make State 43 points better than Princeton.
Yale walloped Princeton, 51-14, a margin of 37 points. State is there-
fore 6 points better than Yale. Yale defeated Harvard, 3-0. Harvard
beat Army, 14-13. Army outclassed Notre Dame to win, 12-0; and Notre

. Dame beat Pitt, 25-12. Pitt beat State, 41-6, using its second and third

teams.

Here's one of our own.
North Dakota tied Oregon.

Duquesne defeated North Dakota_State.
Oregon defeated New York U. which, in

turn, trimmed Carnegie Tech. Carnegie and Northwestern were both
defeated by Purdue by one touchdown margins so the two teams are

equal. Northwestern defeated the University of California at Los An-
geles. The latter defeated St. Mary’s which was the only team to de-
feat Southern California. Therefore the Dukes are champions_of the
country. And here we have been raving about Pitt all year with the
champions in our own back yard.

For some reason or other the gentlemenof the press are still picking
all-America teams. The fact that we dislike such activities was made

’ quite clear in this column last week, but there are many more evils

to these selections than those which we mentioned.

During the course of a football game, ‘the men in the pres box are
informed by an announcer of the men concerned in each play, that is,
the man carrying the ball, the forward passer, the pass receiver, the
man who makes the tackle and the men who lead‘ the interference in
case the latter do some fancy blocking. The announcer is often ac-
quainted only with the players of the home team, a condition which
necessitates the advice of somebody connected with the Vlsltlllg team
in helping the announcer identify its players.

The youth aiding in the identification of these players is usually
one of the apprentice student managers, who is ﬁlled with enthusiasm
and the “I’d die for dear old Rutgers” spirit (apologie-s to Dean
Clothier). He has his favorite on the team, and he utilizes every op-
portunity presented him to link his favorite with the outstanding in-
cidents of the contest. .

I remember one game this year when the ﬁeld was so soggy that
after a few plays had been run off, the numbers on the backs of the
players’ jerseys were covered with mud. It was difficult to distinguish
one player from another, and anything that the student identiﬁer said
was taken as being ﬁnal. ’

This team had a star lineman who was being boosted for future
all-America selections. He played on the left. side of the line. On a
certain play, the opposing team tried to rush oif the tackle on the right
side of X's team's line. The ball carrier was smeared for a loss. The

“student told the announcer that X had made the tackle, so the latter

announced that fact to the gentlemen of the press who were too busy
writing a play by play detail to recognize the obvious error made by
the.student. Such are all-Americans.

 

The latest publicity scheme tried by a certain clothing company
deserves some attention from college students inclined to become pub-
licity managers after they receive 120 credits. This clothing company
made its own all-America team, the members of which were selected
by a group of supposed “newspapermen” from all corners of the
country.

Two signiﬁcant facts concerning the team are that each player se-
lected lived either in a big city or played for a school in a big city
where this clothing company had one of its agencies, and that each
judge is now wearing clothing made by this company.

College dailies throughout the country have been taking shots at
football for several years, declaring that the sport is overemphasized
as an extra-curricular activity and should be done away with or at least
diminished in scope. ,

As far as we can see, the sport is maintained as an attraction for
those students interested in the game and serves as a means of uniting
the student body for a common purpose. No college student is so dull
that he must spend all his spare time on his studies in order to gain
some beneﬁt from them; and in order to furnish amusement for these
students, the schools encourage extra-carricular activities.

School papers are published as part of the extra-curricular program.
Their purpose is practically the same asithat of football; and while its
printed material may not be read by as many people as learn of the
exploits of its football team, readers of the college paper take its con-
tents as official. In case an erroneous report appears in the publica-
tion, the school never hears the end of it.

, Besides all this, college editors receive anywhere from $400 to
$2,500 a year for their work and spend more time on their paper than
the football men do in practice. We cannot see any reason why these
papers should conduct crusades against football; and, if you’re smart,

you probably know that we are strongly in favor of the continuation of-

football as an intercollegiate sport.

 

The Pitt basket ball coaches are adopting a wise course in refusing
the members of the freshman team the right to shoot the ball from the
center of the court when the team is behind" in the scoring. Many
fans were disappointed Saturday evening when the frosh refused to
shoot from past the foul line after they could not work the ball under
the basket against the Allderdice high team. The fans contend that
the liittle Panthers might have won the game had they done as sug-
geste . " ' ,4

The coaches are not particularly interested in seeing the freshman
team win all its games. The main purpose of the team is to develop
players were stars on their high
school teams; and inasmuch as team play is secondary to individual
brilliance in high school competition, the boys have become accustomed
to playing the game in that manner.

It is the work of the freshman coach to break these boys away from
individualism and to emphasize the need of cooperation. If the players
would aim to win all their games during their freshman season and
pay little attention to the system, they would learn little during that
year and would start as novices in their ﬁrst varsity season. School
reputations are based upon the records of the varsity and not those of
its freshman teams.

Enthusiastic Cro‘wd Sees
Ten Bouts

 

Before an enthusiastic crowd of
students and boosters, Pitt’s ﬁrst
college boxing championships came
to a successful close on Wednes-
day night, December 16. The Pitt
men were extremely fortunate in
having the University authorities
erect one of the best rings in the’
collegiate circuit, and the Athletic
office deserves credit for placing
the full facilities of their office at
the disposal of the boxers.

Ten bouts were held in the sta-

dium pavilion, and the bouts were
decided successes. Upsets fur-
nished the main thrills of,the even-
ing, and some of the more ad-
vanced ﬁghters put on real exliibi-
tions of the manly art, The only
knockout of the evening went to
Jack Schricker over Al Schwartz.
Schricker was awarded a T. K.
after the judges had examined
Schwartz and would not allow the
bout to continue. Several boxers
from the -Uniontown Junior Pitt
College showed real promise.
Puglia Wins.

Two bouts were held in the 115-
pound class, with Caramella gain-
ing the decision over McCormick,
and Puglia, of Uniontown, getting
the nod over Patterson. Puglia
upset the dope by decisively
trouncing Patterson. Patterson
was the top-heavy favorite but
seemed to lack the speed and
punch he had shown in former
ﬁghts.

Conti proved his right to one of
the 125-pound berths. by gaining
the decision over Glick in a bout
marred by frequent punching in
coming out of a clinch. Passa-
fume overcame the handicap of
reach and height in getting the
vote over Schimpf in the other 125-
pound class ﬁght.

The 135-pound bouts provided the
biggest upsets of the evening when
Martin llist a decision to Gianatti
of Uniontown_ Martin appeared
sluggish in the ring, not putting up
his regular performance. Nam-
lick showed great improvement
over his last year’s form, and took
a clean decision over Evans in a
free swinging bout.

Decision Booed.

The only unpopular decision of
the evening came in the Santicola-
Rubbo bout. Both bo-ys weighed
in at 145, The judges’ decision
went to Santicola but it was booed
by the crowd. McClure and Gong-
loff put on a fast bout which went
to Gongloff. Both boys were wild,
but packed good punches.

Two of Jock Suther1and’s boys
put on a three-round exhibition in
the heavyweight class. The rounds
were shortened to one minute each,
but they left both Love and
Thompson exhausted at the ﬁnish.

Considering all in all, the team
so far looks better this year than
it ’did at the same time last sea-
son. Those remaining from last
year show the beneﬁts they re-
ceived from a year’s experience,
and the newcomers look especially
good. Schricker again seems to
bethe outstanding man and will
be a hard man for any intercollegi-
ate boxer to “take.” Rubbo looks
especially good also, as do Conti,
Nanilick and Martin. Both Love
and Thompson show lack of neces-
sary experience, and Patterson will
have to step to keep a varsity
berth.

Although Pitt lost the open-
ing game of its western inva-
sion, Doc Carlson, varsity
coach, is conﬁdent that Pitt
will ﬁnish the season with one
of the best records of any team
in the country. The good doc-
tor is shown above. The pic-

Cornell Hands Locals
Initial Defeat

 

The Pitt rifle team continued its
success last week in its matches

with Johns Hopkins University,
Washington University of St.
Louls, and Cornell, The Panthers
copped the meets with Washington
University and Johns Hopkins, but
lost to Cornell.

The Cornell meet resulted in a
tie of 1,400 points apiece out of a
possibleT1500, but the Ithaca boys
were awarded the victory because
of a seven point advantage in the
standing position.

There will be two changes in the
squad this week, Zoller and Geyer
replacing Babyock and Grundy.
Only one meet is scheduled this
week, against the strong Syracuse
,squad.

«L of the strongest teams in the mid-

Times on Successive A

Evenings Next Week

 

With the ﬁrsti three games of their western invasion a1-’ 

ready played, the barnstorming Panther cagersare beginning
to look forward to the holidays and the possibility of dating

’ Ho1lywood’s contributions to feminine pulchritude.

 

 
 
  

Doc C.arlson, Pitt coach, was forced to change his slogan A

from “Win Them All” to “Win The Rest” at the very outset
of the Western trip when his team succumbed to Wisconsin in
a hard fought battle, 30-29, Tuesday night. Captain Steen of
the home team sunk a long ﬁeld goal in the ﬁnal minute of play

to send his ‘team ahead after the score had been tied at 28 all.

Pitt countered with its ﬁnal point
when Tim Lawry sunk a technical
foul shot after the Wisconsin team
had left the ﬂoor due to a misun-
derstanding. The time was too
short, however, to permit another
tossup and the Panthers were re-
lieved of the strain of attempting
to go through the season with a
perfect record.

Kowallis Sensational

Sensational playing by Doc Ko-
wallis enabled the Panthers to win
their second game on the extended
trip against Indiana in an overtime
game 29-24, the following night.
The game was extremely close
throughout and until the extra pe-
riod, neither team was ahead by
more than four points at any time.
The victory was doubly sweet inas-
much as Indiana is the lone “Big
Ten” school to defeat‘ the Pitt
cagers at the Stadium pavilion in
the last four years.

The cagers played Purdue last
night at Lafayette, Indiana, in their
third game in as" many days. The
Boilermakers annually possess one

lads will be seeking revenge for
the 35-33 defeat given the Panther
cagers in 1929, the only meeting

ball schools.
Play Kansas Thrice

Monday, Tuesday and Wednes-
day nights will ﬁnd the Golden
Panthers stacking up against Kan-
sas University at Kansas City.
Kansas U is now the home of Mike
Getto, former All-Ainerican tackle
here at Pitt, and the three-game
engagement with the Kansas pass-
ers opens relations with that
school in a big way. ,

Carlson's crew will probably
have their Christmas dinner ,on

ver, whepe they tangle with the
University of Colorado, December
26. With all of the preparatory
clashes over, the travel-worn bas-
keteers enter the fair state of Cali-
fornia, where they open their Pa-
cific appearance at Berkeley ’on
December 28, meeting the Univer-

of the annihilating defeat the Pan-
ther gridmen received V at the
hands of Southern California a few
years ago should be. some inspira-
tion to the Gold and Blue quintet
when it clashes with Southern Cal-
ifornia’s ﬂoor squad on December
30 and January 2.
Fast Games

These tilts end the extensive
cruise of the Carlsonites; and if
they win a majority of their games,

west, but the Panthers gave them
a great struggle. Purdue was anx-
ious to avenge the 24-22 defeat it
sufl’-ered at the hands of the Panth-
ers in last year’s game at the Sta-
dium pavilion.

Resting tonight after their stren-
uous campaigning-on the Mid-West
frontier this week, Dr. Carlson's
ﬂoormen continue their cross-
country scramble only to stop at
Indianapolis to engage Butler Uni-
versity tomorrow night. The Pitt

tem of play faces on this trip the
most severe test.

Wesley Linsenbeigler, Col. ’32, who
opened the program with selections
from their repertoire.

Harry Abele_ Col. ’35, the "Uke-
lete Pat Haly” of the freshman
class, played and sang several Il0V~
elty numbers. His presentation was
followed by an Apache dance in
which Lillian Myers, Col. '33, and
George Taylor, III, Col. '33, occu-
pied the center of the improvised
stage. 1

Director Carl Cass offered an-
other of his thoroughly genuine and
humorous monologues, this time

reading as her contribution to the
program.

Gene Kelly, Bus. Ad. '33,‘ one of

polish that he has displayed in past
performances. He was accompan-
ied on the piano by Linsey Ralston,
Col. '33, ‘who later -contributed a
piano novelty number.

Trio Scores

The formal part of the program
was concluded by another Cap and

man, all Col. '33, accompanied by
Myron Shuler, Col. ’32, pianist and

Into the deep wilderness of Elk
county, ‘Pennsylvania, there strode
eight warriors in search of big
game. Professor John Dambach,
Professor Fred
Holloway of the physical education
department were two of this octet,
who were stalking large prey in
this Coudersport territory.

Leaving Pittsburgh in Hollo-
way’s automobile early Friday
morning, the two hunters ran into
a heavy storm, and had to hunt
shelter instead of deer. Later, in
conjunction with the other six
members of the party, they saw a
huge buck about half a mile away
on the other side of the mountain.
Bang, bang—after some 37 more
bangs, the buck was wounded——
by only one bullet!

Chasing the wounded animal
which each claimed he had shot,
the various members all became
lost, lost in the deep forests at
night with no sleuth to guide them.
Five long hours they “amped in
a circle, always moving, but go-
ing nowhere in particular.

ten, and then firing twice. Hol-
loway followed instructions, ﬁred
twice, counted ten, and ﬁred once
more. His appeal was answered
by a volley of shots from every
direction, and this plan failed
through too much co-operation.

Following a light down in the
valley, the lost hunters ﬁnally
straggled back into civilization
with their precious buck after
having been stranded for ﬁve
hours. The globe-trotters returned
to their camp next morning.

A one hundred and fifty pound
doe was their next victim, and
the outing was a big success. Com-
ing home on Sunday, Holloway’s
machine got stuck in the mud, and
they cursed, threatened and ca-
jolted the vehicle for two hours
before getting it out of the rut.
As luck would have it, ﬁve huge
deer came to pay a social visit
and see what the commotion was
about, but you can't shoot a deer
on Sunday. Dambach tried to con-
vince himself that the day was Sat-
urday. but his logic wasn’t so good.

Holloway and Dambach returned
Sunday afternoon with lots of ven-
ison, half the mud of Elk county
on the machine, and enough
stories to entertain friends .for

A.C. Robinson
Men’s Speaker

 

Building and Loan Head
Speaks Thursday

A. C. Robinson, vice president of
the Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Com-
pany was the speaker at the Uni-
versity men’s business club meet-
ing yesterday noon, in the Cham-
ber of Commerce building.

Introduced by Chancellor John
G. Bowman, Mr. Robinson, a grad-
uate from the University with the
class of 1882, and who has been
connected with the banking busi-
ness since that time, discussed the
setup, operation, and function of
the National Credit Corporation.

“As a result of -panic, fear, and.
hysteria on the part of the public
which resulted in unwarranted
withdrawals from banks by their
depositors, stripping the banks of
their liquid assets, causing many
perfectly solvent banks to close,
the National Credit Corporation
was formed,” said the speaker.

“The effect of this corporation,
formed through solvents banks in
the twelve Federals Reserve d-is-
tricts has been to allay the fears of
the depositors, to bring money,
stored away, into circulation, and
to relieve strain on good banks, It
has also been a step in satisfying
foreign creditors that the country
is in a sound -financial condition,”
concluded Mr. Robinson, -

Originally planned as an open
Christmas meeting, the December
24 meeting of the University menu
business organization held in the
Chamber of Commerce building
will be a supplement discussion
luncheon meeting,

Because of the interest shown by
members on this month’s discus-
sion topic “Some
Measures,” it was decided to have
Wm. E. Best, Esq., president of the
United States Building and Loan
League speak on “Building and
Loan Views of the President's Con-
ference on Home Ownership." He
will discuss the Building and Loan
view as opposed to the real estate
methods of credit measures,

‘Professor John W. W. Hallock,
head of the department of indus-
trial engineering, will lead the dis-
cussion during the January meet-
ings of the University Business
Men’s club each Thursday noon in
the Chamber of Commerce Build-
ing. The subject to be discussed
will be “Business Stabilization
Through Production Planning and
Control.”

Hallock will divide the discussion
into four chief topics, outlining
one at each meeting. The topics
chosen are as follows: January 7,
“Analysis of Facilities and Re-
quirementsz” January 14, “Time
and Motion Study as .a Factor in
Production Control;” January 21,
“Economics of Control:” January
28, “Technological Unemployment.”

Dr. Hawkins Will speak
To John Marshall Club

Dr. Richard H. Hawkins, profes-
sor of law in the Law school, will
‘speak before the John Marshall
Club on Tuesday evening, January
12. His topic will be of special
interest to pre-legal students.

Last Tuesday evening the club
met at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity house. There was dis-
cussion of important legal matters
of the day, and the members re-
lated court cases which they heard
recently. President John Sweeney
appointed Daniel J. Butler, Bus.
Ad. ’32; Morris Cohen, Col. ’32,
and Robert A. Jarvis, Col. '33, to
the executive committee. Harold
M. Cronin, Col. ’32, was the new
piember voted in by the organiza-

Mc‘Cabe Speaks to Penna.,

Credit Association Men

Speaking before the Credit Asso-
ciation of Western Pennsylvania
at a meeting in the Roosevelt Ho-
tel last Tuesday, Dr. G. K. McCabe,
instructor in economics, discussed
the economic aspect of credit.

In a talk complete with examples
of the imxﬂrtance of credit, Dr.
McCabe stressed the part credits
and loans for speculation played in
pumping up prices in 1926-29. Per-
haps some of the painful results
of deflation could have been avert-
ed by controlling cfedit in such a
manner as to discourage inﬂation.

_ ‘ NIVERSITY ‘STUDENTS
congratulate Dean Rob-

~' ‘cert C. Clothier upon his elec-

,' -t'ion to the presidency of Rut-
gers University. They wish

, .‘ . ihim success in this new work

- ‘sind hope that he will ﬁnd his
‘ "gissociatmns there both pleas-
ant and interesting.

Since coming to Pitt, Mr.
1-Clothier has won for himself
immense . popularity with the
student body. He changed the
mndiergraduates conception of
.a. dean of men, and became a

- companion of the college man.

uinstead of merely the campus
magistrate. I

a Mr. Clothier enjoys talking
with students and is Young
enough to appreciate their in-
terests. He is a dean who can
show as much enthusiasm in
a conversation about football

_ games, frosh rushing, and Jun-

-, for Proms, as he can in one
about educational measure-
_ments and psychological reac-
tion of abnormal adolescents.

Yet, with this splendid abil-
my to’ be the friend of under-

»grad-uate m-en, Mr. Clothier

combines the dignity of his po-
sition and a courtliness of man-
ner when that is expected of
him.
, Mr. Clothier is the type of
administrative officer which
Pitt, with its itinerent student
body, needs. It will be difficult
to find a man capable of occu-
pying the position with the
same degree of success as that
obtained by Mr. Cl-othier.

We think that the best testi-
mony to the popularity of the
man among students is found
in the fact that there wasn't
one satirical “hurrah” heard on
the Pitt campus when his elec-
tion as the heads of Rutgers
was announced.

sults of the campaign for cloth-

juggle statistics and records
about in rapid-fire fashion as
they attempt to complete reg-
istration of 4500 students in a
period that hovers only live
days.

All this has been tossed into
the limbo of the past. A sys-
tem that will make possible a
rational registration, free from
the errors that come with a
concentrated rush job, has
been devised by J. G. Quick,

registrar, and will be put into
effect after the Christmas
holidays.

The new method makes it
possible for a student who is
not planning any changes of
courses to complete his regis-
traction immediately * upon re-
turning to school in January.
If the student desires to,
change courses, he has the op-
portunity of consulting facul-
ty advisers and department
heads for more than a month.
He will be able to make a
slow, deliberate selection of
subjects.

Mid-year registrations in the
past have produced their quo-
ta of mistakes. Much of this
has been the result of poor ad-
vising, by instructors. Yet it
is not the advisers who should
be personally criticized, but
rather the hurried system un-
der which they were com-
pe11ed.to work.

With suﬁicient time to make
a thorough study of each stu-
dent coming to him, the facul-
ty member should be consider-
ably more successful in his
role as adviser and the student
should obtain a class sched-
ule that will better meet his
requirements.

Campus Group

HE SUCCESS of such
events as Women’s Day
and the assembly for Bruce

Bairnsfather proves the value
of meetings of large groups on
the campus. Here is an
“esprit” which no amount of
contact in small units, how-
ever worthwhile, can give.

Because of the nature of our
University, we have doubted
the interest in such inplusive
groups in the past. and they
have been rare. That the in-
terest and» desire does exist
the response to recent campus
‘programs has demonstrated.

Activities like these have
shown the enthusiasm aroused
by projects suggested and car-
ried out by students. The uni-‘
versal cooperation given to af-
fairs sponsored by undergrad-
uates extends even beyond the
circle of those who gain from
association in working directly
upon a specific program. There
is a need for more campus-
widse group interests, orginat-
ing with the students them-
selves.

'-—G1adys S. Schmitt.

Editor, The Pitt Weekly: .

It seems that a certain writer
is quite indignant over the fact
that the students’ go in for dis-
cussing clothes. But let me
quote him: “I see by the pa-
pers that the students of our
justly famed Pitt University
go in for intellectual things on
a really grand scale. They are

seriously discussing the vari-
ous styles of clothes——not in
the dry metaphysical manner
which Carlyle followed in his
“Sartor Resartus” —— no, in-’
deed——but in a practica1-matter-
of-fact way."

However, I see nothing
wrong in such an attitude.
Thinking about clothes, co-eds,
etc., will keep us out of mis-
chief. The dominating classes
should encourage such think-
ing. .
As an example for instance,
in the days of the Imperial
Russia, the students did not
concern themselves about their
wardrobes, but they did dis-

divino Rule and the Right of
the nobles and clergy to ex-
ploit the people. Instead of
discussing the latest style of
clothing, they discussed Karl
Marx and Tolstoi. Had the
Tsar urged the students to
think about such things as
wearing apparel, he might still
be exploiting the ignorant peo-
ple.

Or let us take another ex-
ample, while we are on the
subject. Suppose Adam and
Eve had discussed the latest
Paris styles instead of trying
to eat the forbidden fruit of
the tree of knowledge. We
would even now be living in a
state of eternal bliss, instead
of in a state of frozen assets,
moratoriums and Wickersham
commissions; which things are,

cuss social and economic
problems. They did question I
the Tsar’s self-styled jure

Pitt W E E KLY Letters

lb

I take it, products of our sinful
age.

We students are really in
earnest about our clothes. We
would _ endorse Carlyle’s state-
ment that clothes have made
men of us, but we would deny,

__of course, that they are mak-
ing clothes-screens of us.

All of which reminds me that
the other day I observed a stu-
dent poetaster suddenly taken
by the pains of labor, and
after much agonizing, brought
forth the following brain-child,
which he proudly presented to
an expectant world. Like a
faithful Boswell, I jotted down
the words that they might be
preserved for posterity. I
herewith present them to you:

To wear rough-and-ready clothes:

that is the question,

Whether etiquette shall let us dress

as lumberjacks, .

Or rather wear the starched and

formal styles

Which irritate the neck and strain

the pocketbook.

And then again the common rough-

and-ready suits

Quite easy rest upon our backs.

‘Tie a consummation

Devoutly to he wished. We save on

laundry bills,

Avoiding, too, the tailor’s high-

priced fees. ‘

But can we, dressed as common

working men, engage

The fair co-eds? Ay, there's the

rub: perchance

They’II snub us. The thought must

' give us pause.

There's the respect of pretty blonds

and sweet brunettes,

That makes us hesitate to wear the

common clothes.

For who would hear the sneers of

sweet co-eds,

The freshman’s laugh, the senior's

contumely,

The pangs of dispriz’d love, the

law's grave frown,

The insolence of office,

- spurns

That we must bear from well-

dressed men,

When we ourselves by wearing

Business Suits

Might gain the favor of the entire

world?

Thus, custom makes us rather bear

the Business Suit

Than patironim the styles we love

so well-—-
Methinks that fashion doth make
cowards of us all.

A Mixture of
Things Artistic

sss  ssa
Gladys Schmllt

There is little enough to
hear and see in the way of
things artistic this week. The
stage and concert halls are
in their usual pre-Christmas
hush. The only play in Pitts-
burgh is the aloof and gentle
‘little one called “House Beau-
tiful," with its strangely in-
timate scene-changing and its
frail settings; symphonies are
in the n‘e'ar,past and the far
future, and publishers are
more concerned with rare gift
editions than with new publi-
cations.

O O O

The Boston Women’s Orchestra
will not appear in Pittsburgh this
season. The May Beegle series is
offering Ted Shawn and the Deni-
shawn Dancers in its stead. Since
there has been no program of the
classical type of dancing on a
Pittsburgh stage for the last two
years and since the Denishawns
are the outstanding exponents of
that particular school, the substi-
tute should be quite as interesting
as the original oﬁer.

We can look into the future with
a good deal of artistic cheer. The

‘pendable and solid orchestra.

They will play the Bach Passacag-

Meanwhile, let us enjoy the
more bourgeoise, less elegant
sort of art that always comes
with Christmas time. Let us
go to the book shopsifor the
express purpose of looking at
gift editions. Let us study the
possible effects of Christmas
trees trimmed in nothing but
white and silver; let us ad-
mire imported dolls; let us
buy Christmas cards that
boast illustrations from Dick-
ens or Madonnas from the late

Renaissance. Such a relaxa-

tion can do nobody any harm.

istic, Christmas can offer an

opportunity for the study of

Mr. Kendall, Once Saved From Watery Grave, Now
Disposes of Depression Erasers

 

. HELEN WEIDELI
The critical moment in the age of language development——
Scene-—-Jackson Park in Chicago when one of the Univer-
sity’s expert linguists almost ﬁnished his career before it began.
A small lad, age three years, waded happily into the clear

waters. of the lagoon.

Undaunted by the clutching waves the

tot eagerly wandered further and further into the warm water.

As the lad was about to sink for the last time in the briny deep,
a worry-crazed uncle, Sunday suit¢

and all, struggled to his assistance
and. dragged the boy from the
grasp of death. T-hat uncle should
be reverenced by all linguists and
students for saving the life of
Maurice H. Kendall, instructor in

the department of modern lan-
guages.
-Svalles Resistance
One of the most popular in-

structors in the department, Mr.
Kendall, at the same time is one
of the strictest. One beautiful but
dumb girl sat~ before him and
gazed with limped eyes into his
kind face as she humbly admitted.
“But, professor, I just can’t seem
to get these inﬂections and ac-
cents.”

Bored, yet unmoved by these fem-
inine charms, he calmly replied
“Isn’t that regretable."

In his own words, Mr. Kendall
has taught “X plus ﬁve years”
“X” includes all the years spent
teaching at a sectarian college
where he even took up the collec-
tion on Sundays; at St. John's
Militarky Academy where he sport-
ed a uniform and was lieutenant-
colonel in the corps of instructors;
and at his alma mater, De Pauw
University, Greencastle, Indiana.
IFive represents the number of
years enjoyed in the service of the

don’t need to be an expert or even
to participate in major sports. Yﬁou
can get just as much fun out ‘of
fencing, boxing, or wrestling as out
of football or basketball," said the
man who was a leading fencer dur-
ing his college days at Columbia
University.

Would Have More lntramurals.

“I am in favor of encouraging
the English system of athletics-
more intramural competition. Col-
lege men should participate in
sports for the pleasure and not the
money in them.”

“Have you beneﬁted in any way

from your participation in ath-
letics?” we asked him.
“Certa.inly."
“How?”
“Live longer and feel better.

There's no basis for that talk about
athletes dying young and ‘athlete's
heart.’ Participation in athletics,
as long as it is not excessive can
-do nothing but good,” the states-
man concluded.
Englishman Echoes Gerard.

, Dr. Jacks, too, believes in the
English system, praised by Gerard.

repetition. When ﬁrst beginning
his career he came across a pass-
age in a book which he has adopt-
ed as his motton—-“You can never
ov»er-estimate the stupidity of your

opinion that it doesn't hurt an in-
structor to descend to the level of
his students, occasionally. He has
the habit of referring to his stu-
dents as children and threatens to
write letters home to their papas
and mamas.
Tosses Erasers

He completely surprised one of
his classes recently by showing a
fit of temper. After vainly attempt-
ing to erase the blackboard with a
worn-out eraser, he went through
the pile, collected all the hopeless
erasers and threw them out the
window, explaining that it was the
0111)’ Way to get rid of them per-
manently.

VVhile teaching in St. John’s Mil-
itary Academy, Mr. Kendall, had
one hardship (outside of wearing a
uniform.) In order to open a win-
dow in his classroom he had to go
out the door, climb a pair of steps
and crawl over a fence. At the
sectarian college the administra-
tion wanted him to teach a seven
o’clock class on Saturday morn-
ings but he refused, saying that
he never stayed up that late.

Mr. Kendall is very impressed
with the Panther Fashion Plate
Contest because his best friend is
in the clothing business. Agreeing
emphatically with Mrs. Winch.ell’s
little boy, Walter, that the depres-
sion has taken a slump, he says,
“The only way to end hard times
is to elect Eddie Cantor to the
Pxresidency.” ,
