Students wandering through
the Schenley Quad Tuesday be-
tween noon and 2 p.m. may have
noticed a scene a bit out of the
ordinary — a group of people
dressed in large white hazmat
suits emptying decaying trash
onto a blue tarpaulin.

Three students, members of

some of Pitt’s environmental ad-.

vocacy student groups, donned
the protective outﬁts and sorted
trash from general, unsorted
trash cans collected from vari-
ous campus buildings including
David Lawrence Hall, Litchﬁeld
Towers and Posvar Hall. Each
piece of trash was sorted into
one offour piles — paper, plas-
tic bottles, compostables and
trash that should be in a landfill
— as a public spectacle in honor
of Waste Week.

Waste Week, -a Univers-ity—
wide initiative, kicks off the
awareness effort for RecycleM—

advocates waste-reduction ac-

Pitt Day in Harrisburg faces logistical diﬂiculties

Matt Schaff
Senior Staff Writer

Hundreds of Pitt students, adminis-
trators and alumniwill criss-cross the
State Capitol as a part of Pitt Day in
Harrisburg next week, but they may
face some difﬁculties securing sit-
down meetings with their legislators.

The 2013 Pitt Day in Harrisburg
will occur on Tuesday, Feb. 12, one
week after Gov. Tom Corbett unveiled
a budget proposal that would freeze
next year’s higher-education appro-
priations at this year’s levels. As in
past years during the annual event,
small groups of Pitt advocates -
students and other University com-
munity members who signed up for
the journey — will thank legislators
for previous funding and address
Corbett’s appropriation recommen-

dations.

‘ Event promoters like Student
Government Board President Gor-
don Louderback have encouraged
students to discuss Corbett’s budget
and their Pitt stories face-to-face with
different legislators — particularly
those from their home 

“It’s a lot easier to walk into an
office and say, ‘I’m a constituent of
yours,”’ Louderback said.

But, because of logistical con-
straints, no one can guarantee such
meetings to participants.

“We can’t make that promise,”

' said SGB Governmental Relations

Chairman Robert Beecher, who was

_ also the Governmental Relations 

chairman during the 2012 Pitt" Day
inHarrisburg. '

One constraint involves prepara-
tion: According to Pitt’s Manager of

Alumni Advocacy Jennifer Poller — '

 

who projects an attendance of about
300 Pitt afﬁliates at this year’s event
— she and Pitt’s Governmental Rela-
tions Ofﬁce can conﬁrm meetings
that match students with the appro-
priate legislators for only a fraction
of attendees.

“It’s just too cumbersome to
make appointments with 259 legis-
lators,” she said. “For the rest [of the
students], we tell them that they’re
welcome to go visit their legislator
throughout the day.”

Participants should also expect.

an element of “planned chaos” on
the day itself, according to Beecher,
who admits that students in the past
have found trouble squeezing into
legislators’ packed schedules.

‘ “We would love it if every student
got to sit down with their legislator,”

he said. “The problem is that they’re ‘

very busy. A legislator who might

   

i- G‘-¥FT crllces VAiB - 

have a great relationship with you
might have a very important leader-
ship role —— that means they’re out
of the office.” '

But having an unavailable legis-
lator should not discourage partici-
pants, as they’ can effectively appeal
to staffers and others’ legislators,
Beecher said. - .

“If they show up and they’re will-
ing to have their voice heard, they
will make a difference, and they will
be satisﬁed,” he added.

Despite the difﬁculty of quanti-
fying any “difference” students and
other attendees might make at the
once—a—year event — Beecher said
he has no scientiﬁc “scorecar ” at
his disposal —— additional parties in-
volved vvith this year’s event strongly
believe that such advocacy exerts a

real effect on political decision-making.

“The more people we have — the more bus-
loads of people we bring up there —— the more
inﬂuence we have,” said Pittsburgh—area lawyer
Arnold Epstein, who earned his bachelor’s de-
gree from Pitt in 1969 and will participate in
next week’s event. “Legislators are looking for
votes. They want to make sure the constituents
are happy.”

State Senator Bob Robbins, R-District 50,
said this Pitt tradition could affect his colleagues’
behavior. 

“I think programs like this have an outstand-
ing effect and are very important. Any time you

reach out and touch people, you leave an impres-

sion,” Robbins said.

With regard to his memory of previous Pitt
Day in Harrisburg events, “Everybody leaves
with a smile on their face, Pittwants  be part
of the solution, not part ofthe prola1em,”- he said.

Along with enthusiasm surrounding Pitt
Day in Harrisburg comes some suggestions for
improvement. '

Junior urban studies major Meredith McNair,
who attended Pitt Day in Harrisburg in 2011
and 2012 and believes they’re worthwhile, said
she worries about the magnitude of the effect
if students ﬁnd it so difficult to address legisla-
tors directly.

“In 2011, I didn’t feel like I made an impact,”

she said. “My group only got to talk to one rep.”

Senior history major Darmy Zemel said that
the student body should be frustrated that de-
spite the 17-year history of Pitt Day in Harris-
burg, in recent years, state support for higher
education has been either stagnant or falling,
both in absolute terms and in terms of the por-
tion of the state budget.

“Our efforts haven’t been aggressive enough,”
Zemel said.

Over the last two years, Corbett’s proposed
budgets have included signiﬁcant cuts in state
appropriations toward higher education in
Pennsylvania. In 2011, Corbett proposed aplan
that cut appropriations by 50 percent, but this
ﬁgure was reduced to 22 percent just days before
budget approval.

Similarly, last year, Corbett proposed 30

’ percent appropriation reductions toward state

public colleges, but received backlash from his
Democrat and Republican colleagues, alike. A
budget that did not cut or increase appropria-
tions was ultimately approved. ‘

“There’s no reason our percentage should go
down. It. seems like we’re not asking enou ,”
said Zemel, who has worked on numerous local
political campaigns but has not attended a Pitt
Day in Harrisburg. “It would take somethingbig
to have an effect.”

McNair had one big idea.

“I think that a mass student protest at the
Capitol would be awesome,” she said.

Whatever the future holds for Pitt advocacy
in Harrisburg, registration is still open for 'I‘ues—
day’s event, and the registration website can be
accessed here. Buses will depart the William Pitt
Union at7 a.m. and arrive at the Capitol between
10:30 and 11 a.m. Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
will deliver an address to attendees and legisla-
tors in the rotunda at 3 p.m. I

separating the trash into piles educated
students on the recyclability of items.
Considering that all the trash was mixed
together and not already separated into
one ofthe four categories, Coleman noted
that the demonstration showed students
“how much could have been recycled in-
stead of going to a landfill.”

Carenbauer agreed with Coleman that
the event would make the recyclable-
versus-trash distinction clearer and pos-
sibly foster future prevention.

“I’m hoping this develops a more sus-

tainable conscience among the student
body,” Carenbauer said.

Senior Brenna Sweetman, student
sustainability coordinator for Sodexo
Dining Corporation, co-president of
Free the Planet and one of the hazmat-
suit-wearing trash sifters, said that the
initiative was “trying to raise awareness
of students wasting less and living more
sustainability.”

Students appeared to take notice.

Freshman Megan MacGillivray said
she stopped on her walk back to her Li-
tchfield Towers residence hall because
“you don’t see people digging through
trash every day.”

Ryan Jansson, an undecided fresh-
man, mirrored MacGillivray’s surprise
at the sight.

“I thought they were digging for trea-
sure on the blacktop,”]ansson said.

The relative absurdity and oddity of
the sight for students did manage to get
them to stop and listen to what Waste
Week advocates were saying.

Freshman Caitlin Shoemaker said the
event was eye—opening for her.

“['1‘he event was] something out of
the ordinary,” Shoemaker said. “I really
didn’t think about throwing things away
[in the correct place], but there are a lot
of things that can be recycled.” I

Don’t be an ugly Amer'can: Pay
  attention to history and geography

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

There are a lot of YouTube videos
for us to use as procrastination
tools. There are some cringe-
worthy ones, likethe one of a
guy doing a Cannonball into a
pool of solid ice and totally wip-
ing out. There are cute ones, like
anything with small animals or
giggling babies. Then we have
scary ones. . t
No, not just the ones with
awkward, embarrassing par-
ents. I’m-atalking about videos

, like “Why We Need to Teach Ge-

ography,” or “I_(ids Can’t Answer
Basic Questions.”

trying to answer questions that
are, as the title suggests, basic.
Talk show hostjay Leno asks high
school students questions about

, geography in his video, wherein
students fail to‘ recognize which _

ocean borders Florida, or how
many Great Lakes we have. "
The answers are the Atlantic
Ocean, and ﬁve. I’m only making
sure here. We’re on our way to
college degrees, you know.
“Basic Questions” features a
student asking his peers some

Both clips showcase teenagers

simple questions about U.S.
civics. Nothing here is too chal-
lenging, either: Naming the vice
president or identifying the war
in which America won its inde-
pendence should not be a strug-
gle foranyone over the age of
10, ’andfI’m being generous with
that number.

Again, the answers are Joe
Biden and the Revolutionary War
— just so we’re on the same page.

Not knowing’ some of the
answers to these questions is
inexcusable. There is no reason
why any student who has suc-

T cessfully completed a course in

United States history at roughly
a fourth-grade level should not
be confident enough to name the
countries involved in the Ameri-
can Civil War.

. A civil war, by deﬁnition, im-
plies that the battle‘ takes place
between two groups within the
samecountry. Maybe you doubt-
ed yourself when thinking that
just the United States was the
complete response.

We, as Americans, are com-
paratively pathetic in terms of

geography and current-event
. knowledge. For example, the

European Journal of Commu-
nication conducted a survey of

questions relating to general
international affairs to a group
of citizens of Denmark, Finland,
Britain and the U.S. According to
the results, roughly 75 percent of
the Europeans could give a deﬁ-
nition of the Taliban. Just over
half of the Americans surveyed
could do the same.

This should strike you as
odd, considering that the United
States waged war in Afghanistan
against the Taliban’s command.

So it’s clear that both teens
and adults in America have some
issues. According to a study by
Xavier University, teens, like
the vast majority of Americans,
struggle to answer questions
asked on the United States Citi-
zenship Test, regardless of the
fact that high school students
take U.S. civics courses.

But why are we so lost? There ’
are several potential explana-
tions for Americans’ clueless-
ness. , V

One is that the United States
government and political sys-
tem as a whole, especially when
coupled with our brief, yet event-
fullhistory, is unfortunately very
complex.

ECKROATE

There’s the federal government, the
state government and divisions of local
government down to schooldistricts. Our
governmental-positions have different
term lengths, ranging from two years to

a lifetime appointment. It can be hard to

keep track of everything. g g
Another explanation for our ignorance

in terms of geography is the fact that the
United States is isolated. We only share‘ _
our borders with Mexico and Canada. The _

United States is a more signiﬁcantgworld
power than ourgimmediate neighbors.

familiar with its surrounding nations,
this poses more of an issue. Considering
that France is roughly the size of Texas,
it makes sense for French citizens to be

familiar with at least a few of France’s

neighbors. , , —
Living in France and otherlsmaller,
more numerously surrounded nations
makes learning multiple languages more
necessary, as well. If our native language
in Pennsylvania were different from that
of New York, we’d have to learn at least
some of their language, wouldn’t we?
But I think that our failure to remain
up-tﬁo—date on civic knowledge ‘rests in

" something else. _
There is a lack of urgency and impor-

tance surrounding this information.
Some people assume they will never
need to know how many constitutional
amendments exist —— 27, by the way. i
Familiarity with the amendments is
important. If your rights are being threat-
ened, it’s good to know from where your
rights are derived. _ «
A bit of historical knowledge is helpful
when you consider current headlines, too.
Knowing our history with countrieslike
China and Russia will help you to reason
through some of the murky diplomacy
that the United States faces with them
now.’ Furthermore, knowing that our big-
gest allies have been our enemies in the

It’s helpful to know this stuff, wheth-

er or not you’re tuning into CNN every _

night. In this case, ignorance certainly
isn’t bliss.

And when you hear about a massacre
in Georgia, as in the country, wouldn’t
you feel dumb if you were worried about
your grandma who enjoys her retirement
eating peaches in the state of Georgia?

, It’s too late for us to pay more atten-
tion in high school civics, but hopefully
‘keeping ‘up with the news and doing some
reading foryour history general education
classes will keep you out of embarrassing
YouTube videos. I

Forward your civics questions to Claire
at ceckroate@gmail.com.

If someone in France isn’t vaguely past is an interesting fact to consider.

“Warm Bodies”
Starring: Nicholas
Hoult, Teresa Palm-
er, John Malkovich
Directed by: Jonathan
Levine

Grade: A-

Beating hearts, decent organi-
zational skills, Windex-blue eyes
and a subtle sense of minimal-
ist humor — these are not the
typical zombie characteristics
Hollywood has pumped out over
the years.

But writer and directorJona-
than Levine pulls off a refreshing
twist on the undying genre with
“Warm Bodies.” And not unlike
his 2011 ﬁlm “5o/5o” — a blend
of comedy and drama — it suc-
cessfully walks the tightrope of
genre collision.

The movie indulges a bit too
much in the sappiness of forbid-
den love that was once respect-
fully reserved for the Capulets
and Montagues but has recently
been damned by vampires and
werewolves. Still, even the over-
wrought moments of cuteness
don’t slow “Warm Bodies” down.

It’s an uphill, against-the-odds
love story peppered with some
clever laughs and a few gruesome
moments. .

In the post—apocalyptic, zom-
bie—ﬁlled world of urban some-
where, the humans are in the
minority and they’ve shacked up

behind 50-foot concrete fortress 

walls around the city’s downtown
district. Meanwhile, the zombies
(or “corpses,” as the humans have
dubbed them) lurk around sub- -
urbia with the urgency‘ of con-
densed soup.

But these zombies are not
your typical undead. They grunt
and growl, sure. But their dead
eyes aren’t exactly lifeless —
they have a more pensive, aloof
glint to them. The zombies even
acknowledge one another from

‘time to time with something be-

tween a moan and a mumble. And
they don’t look that grotesque,
all things considered. They could
pass for people in line at the DMV.

Then there’s R (Nicholas
Hoult) — at least, he’s pretty sure
his human name started with an
“R.” He’s a particularly astute,
far—sighted zombie. R narrates
the movie, sharing with us his
existential musings, such as his
inner conﬂict with eating peo-
ple’s brains and his unfulﬁlled

‘ yearnings. He wants to interact,

have conversations and just enjoy

the company of others, much like
what he imagines life was like
before the unknown pandemic/
plague/virus hit. The not-so-sub-
tle commentary on the numbing
effects of the cell—phone era is

- thoughtful and probably neces-
- sary.

During a ﬂesh-eating raid on
a human scout unit, R gobbles
the brains of the typical zombie
movie’s would-be hero in-anticli—
-mactic excellence. Then, as the

t -“age—‘old love story goels—,~R~”=falls ~

for his most recent meal’s former
girlfriend, the porcelain—skinned
Julie (Teresa Palmer). In an unex-
plained moment of humanity, the
inner philosopher peaks through
the exposed neck veins and drool.
R saves ]ulie’s life from his fellow
diners and smuggles her back to
his bachelor pad at the airport.

There’s a “Wall-E”—like chem-
istry between the two as they
spend days together in close
quarters, listening to Bob Dylan
vinyl records and falling in love
without words. Palmer handles
the role with patience and grace,
and by the 45-minute mark, she’ll
have you relating to R’s affec-
tions.

Popularity turns fans sour, sellout bands receive undeserved ﬂack c

Csilla Thackray
FVPTS Contributor

At some point in our lives, we all have fallen
victim to listening to the trivial notion that
a once—loved band sold out. I’ve heard this
sentiment countless times, and although it’s
an alluring argument, I’ve recently started
to question what exactly constitutes aband
achieving the status of sellout. '

With an increased fan base, there  clear ’ '

ﬁnancial payoffs that an artist can accumu-
late from an illustrious career. ‘But once an
artist taps into this success, he or she tends
to hit a sour chord among initial followers.
Although it seems that various indicators
of success should warrant the sellout claim,
it is actually the artist_’s newfound success
on the whole that poses the greatest threat.

When the success of these artists. transcends‘

what we originally knew, we lose our ability
to associate with them ‘as we did when they
struggled as no-na_mes."By calling them ‘sell:
outs, we cast a shameful shadow over their
success and mask thepain we feel when they

surpassjour expectations. _

Typically, I’ve found these accusations
most persuasive when passionately spewed

it’s all a facade masking a deeper issue. And
I would like to offer up independent music

When it comes to the realm of indepen-

listener who forages into every nook and

listener develops an intense bond not only
with the music, but with the artists behind it.
This intense bond typically gives the listener

our expectations. Hearing others excitedly
chatting about our treasured ﬁnd threatens
the sense of ownership and seems to ignite
the strong desire within us to turn our backs
on our beloved band.

Admittedly, I have fallen victim to this
hype. The charm of the accusation has worn
off: I have begun to see it more as a blindly
ignorant claim than as an insightfully in-
formed observation.

With a rise in popularity, there come
consequences that are natural for a band
achieving and sustaining its success. The
band will often start with a studio—released

album that entices a larger label to pick up,

the band and heavily promote its latest single
via popular airwaves. It’s then usually supple-

or instrumental talent, driven by larger and
more expensive venues that will later reﬂect

 in thesound of the next album release — all

indicators of a band selling out.

When you compare bands such as Ra-
diohead and The Black Keys, however, it be-
comes clear that trying to deﬁne a sellout is
not only an arbitrary endeavor, but also one
that simply cannot be empirically supported.

Take Radiohead, for example, a band that
has rarely come under sellout scrutiny but
has shown some of the classic indicators.
While the band has essentially maintained
the same membership, its 1992 hit “Creep”
will forever haunt the airwaves. In the past

’ F Naming The Black Keys as a sellout while
praising Radiohead for maintaining its in-
dependent status when the two bands are
similar in so many regards presents the issue
of how to classify a sellout. We could argue
that one is more inherently talented than
the other, gets more airtime or puts on a

bigger concert production. But I think it’s
quite clear what is at play here.

The Black Keys, a band that many
20—somethings haveknown since its begin-

narrative shatters‘. Try as we might, it is not
that we can operationally deﬁne a sellout in
certain ways, butthat we cannot handle the
disparitybetween ourselves and the previ-
ously similar, now prosperous, artists.

So, I beg of you, dear indie music lovers,
remove “sellout” as you once knew it from

Perhaps it is instead the inherent (and
selfish) sadness you feel in the face of their
success that leads you to this accusation.
You words start to sound more like those of
a crushed fan than those of a musical inge-
nue. It’s time to come to terms with a new
narrative: These artists truly might not be
sharing a two-bedroom apartment with four
people and three cats like you are. Even if
their lack of poverty makes them less relat-
able, re-evaluate the true quality of their
music rather than the factors of their success
before you deﬁantly remove them from your
favorite playlist. E

pletely unlike our airports) is hilariously
awkward, as he stares at her eating; trying
to play it cool. R’s pale, longing eyes do a
lot of the talking, and she picks up on how
hard he’s trying. Julie even notes, with a
trace of very human confusion and envy,
“You try so much harder than mostipeople
to be better.” Everyday with her, R’s skin
gets a bit rosier and his walk ‘a little‘ taller.

Their connection sparks something

But a mutual humanrzombie enemy§:i-~ the

to human form. And _]ulie’s father (John
Malkovich), the military leader of the hu-
man resistance, isn’t exactly on board with
her new boyfriend or their unlikely plan
to save the world.

The cathartic power of actual human
interaction rings loudly throughout “Warm
Bodies,” and it’s enough to make you feel
bad about your inability to keep your ﬁn-
gers off your cell phone. It’s also enough
to carry Levine’s storyline.

For the genre that simply refuses to die,
Levine finally gives the zombies their say.
He gives us a fresh, even hopeful, take on
the walking dead, as well as the walking
living. 3

on the CD. As a solo electric guitar plays 1

a sequence ofsimple chords, the listener
is exposed to the clear tone and beauti-
ful, throaty nature of Caughthran’s voice
for the first time. This song is a welcome
change of pace on the album, breaking
from the fast—paced rhythm and stick—it-
to-the—man attitude exhibited in every
other track.

“Life Less Ordinary” serves as an in-
troduction to the final track, the aptly
named “Last Revelation.” The band brieﬂy
returns to its punk sound to close out the
album. Caughthran sings, “This is our last
revelation / We had such great expecta-

struggle to understand any of the lyrics
over the sounds of frenzied guitars and
drums. The lack of variation in the style

both a short album and a somewhat tiring
listening experience.

Aside from these weaknesses, how-
ever, The Bronx has created an album that
makes up for lost time. I

Paul Chryst stepped up to the podium with a
hugegrin on his face.

“I’d like to say it’s good to see everyone
again,” the Pitt football head coach joked, “but
it’s been a nice respite.”

Appearingbefore the media for the ﬁrst time
since his ﬁrst season in charge of the Panthers
ended with a defeat against Ole Miss inthe BBVA
Compass Bowl, Chryst seemed excited about
Pitt’s 2013 recruiting class — and rightfully so.

Chryst and his staff were happy to announce

‘ on Wednesday aﬁemoon that 23 recruits had

faxed in their National Letters of Intent and
committed to play football at the University of
Pittsburgh. The additions complete an unusu-
ally large 27-man recruiting class that will add
talent and depth to the Pitt roster. '

Chryst pleased with deep recruiting class

“Today is an exciting day,” Chryst said. ‘As a
coach, the greatest thing about today is adding
players to your team, and there’s nothing more
important than the team. I am extremely excited
about this group of27 guys who believe Pitt is a
great ﬁt for them.” '

According to Rivals.com, Pitt’s recruiting
class ranks 33rd in the country.

It’s unlikely that Chryst would’ve been smil-
ing if not for the conﬁrmation earlier in the day
that highly touted wide receiver Tyler Boyd from
Clairton, Pa., had signed for Pitt.

“Tyler’s gotten a lot of attention,” Chryst
said. “He is a tremendous guy and a competi-

tor. We think he can impact our offense in a if °

number of ways.”_

of the second half and the ﬁrst overtime,

the emotional roller-coaster ride came to a
screeching halt after two overtimes with Pitt
two points behind when the clock hit 0:00
for the fourth time. '

' The heartbroken Kiesel’s 26 points were
not enough, as the Panthers (9-13, 0-9 Big
East) dropped their ninth Big East game this

season and 29th consecutive regular-season

conference game overall. Providence (7-15,
.2-7 Big East) received a game-high 25 points

Winning effort.

For a while, it appeared that Pitt would
ﬁnally break its lengthy and unwanted con-
ference losing streak. A

Kiesel’s 18 ﬁrst-half points powered the
Panthers offense as the team sunk all 11 free-
throw attempts in the ﬁrst half after a lowly
8—for-20 performance from the charity stripe
in the loss to South Florida on Sunday.

After carrying a six—point advantage into
the second half, Pitt’s lead vanished quickly
as the team only managed to convert two ﬁeld
goals in the ﬁrst nine minutes of the second
half. That six-point. lead at the half turned
into an eight-point ‘gap in Providence’s favor
halﬁ/gray through the second frame.

» Pitt’s superb free-throw shooting in the
ﬁrst half did not translate to second—half
success. The Panthers struggled mightily
from the foul line, going 4-for-11 in the ﬁnal
20 minutes of regulation and squandering
multiple chances to tie the game throughout.

Impending raise for Baltimore
quarterback Joe F lacco will
beneﬁt Ravens’ rivals

Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco is set to receive a significant pay raie after leading hi

team to the Super Bowl this season. MCT Campus

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

When the 2013 National Football League season
rolls around,_]oe Flacco may be the highest-paid
quarterback in the league. He certainly will be
in the top three.

It remains to be seen if he can unseat the
two highest-paid quarterbacks, Drew Brees and
Peyton Manning, who make $20 million and
$19.2 million, respectively. There’s no question
that he’ll make more than elite quarterbacks
Tom Brady, Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger
and Aaron Rodgers. Those four quarterbacks
each make less than $16 million.

Brady, the younger Manning and Roeth-
lisberger all have multiple Super Bowl titles,
and Rodgers was statistically the league’s best
quarterback for the past two regular seasons.

But as Flacco proved this season by leading
the Baltimore Ravens to the Super Bowl title,
the regular season just doesn’t matter. Flacco’s
87.7 passer ratingwas 12th in the NFL, average
for a 32-team league. He was 16th in yards per
game with 239 and 19th in completion percent-
age, completingonly 59.7 percent ofhis passes.

This isn’t cherry—picking stats to make the
MVP of Super Bowl XLVII look bad. The only
major quarterback statistic that Flacco excelled
in was sacks — he took 35 of them —— but he’ll
be getting top—tl1ree money.

So why is Flacco, who spent two years at Pitt
before transferring to the University of Delaware

in search of playing time, getting this money?
The answer is simple: He had an outstanding
postseason. ‘

As average as the ﬁfth—year quarterback has
been in his professional career, he was just as
good during the Ravens’ march to victory in
last Sunday’s game. Flacco led all quarterbacks
in the postseason with a passer rating of 117.2.
His 11 touchdowns also ranked ﬁrst, and Flacco
didn’t throw any interceptions in the playoffs.

He still ﬁnished in the middle of the pack at
seventh out of 13 quarterbacks in yards per game
and completion percentage. Several plays for
which he received praise are better credited to
bad defense or a talented wide receiver.

His dramatic gan1e—tying touchdown pass
against the Denver Broncos in the divisional
round was drastically underthrown, and Bron-
cos safety Rahim Moore made a junior—varsity
attempt at defending the pass. S

In the Super Bowl drive that put the Ravens
up 34-29, Flacco completed a pass to Anquan
Boldin down the sideline. Boldin had to make a
catch with a defender draped over him. If Rodg-
ers, Brady, Manning or Brees threw that pass, it
would have been a back-shoulder pass, making
the defender useless based on the ball’s position.
Flacco can’t throw that pass, and Boldin had to
bail out his quarterback.

Unless you’re a Ravens fan or someone who
just hates how much professional athletes make,

GABLER

there’s no reason to be upset that‘Flacco is poised

A to make this much money. It will most likely help

your NFL team.

The Ravens have several key players they
will struggle to‘ re—sign after they give Flacco
north of $18 million. Linebackers Paul Kruger
and Darmell Ellerbe, comerback Cary Williams,
offensive lineman Bryant McKinnie and tight

end Dennis Pitta are all free agents. Not to men-

tion that Baltimore needs to ﬁnd someone to
replace retiring future Hall- of-Famer Ray Lewis
and aging superstar safety Ed Reed needs to be
re—signed. ,

One of those key players could end up on

 

leader in health care.

your team, because the Ravens are paying an
above—average quarterback‘ elite money. For
Steelers fans, this guarantees that the purple
team from Marylandwillbe less talented in 2013
thanits 2012 championship—winning squad.

If you support Baltimore, enjoy the celebra-
tion, because the team will have to go through a
lot of change to avoid a change at the quarter-
back position. There’s not much else the team
could have done in regard to Flacco.

Baltimore reportedly offered him $16 million
per year injuly, and he turned it down because
he wanted elite money. At times, it had seemed
questionable Whether’ he would return to the
Ravens next season.

But Flacco won his gamble, and he’ll cash
in big. I

RECRUITS

ment to Pitt in favor of playing at West Virginia
or Tennessee, Coach Chryst said he wasn’t wor-
ried “at all” that the talented wide receivers fax
would come through. .
“There was good dialogue [with Boyd],”
Chryst said. “We don’t get caught up in a lot of

the buzz. I always felt good about [his commit-

ment]. We’re really excited to have him.”
Joining_Boyd will be two ofhis fellow Clairton
teammates, receiver,Terrish Webb and defen-
sive back Titus Howard.
Chryst was also happy to talk about the
chances that Dorianjohnson, the other big-
name recruit that officially joined the Panthers

on Wednesday, might see the ﬁeld as early as
next season. 4 t

“He’s going to get an opportunity [to play] ,”
Chryst said. “He’s a special player.”

The 6-foot-5, 290-pound offensive lineman
from Belle Vernon, Pa., was ranked as one of
the best 50 high school seniors in the nation
by both ESPN and Rivals.com.

_ Of tl1e 27 recruits, four have already enrolled
early at Pitt —— quarterback Tra’Von Chapman,
defensive lineman Tyrique Jarrett, tight end
Scott Orndoff and defensive lineman Shakir
Soto. .

Throughoutthe press conference, Chryst
emphasized that his staffs main goal in recruit-
ing players this year was to “get bigger,” and
the numbers suggest they succeeded. All but
two of the recruits are listed as taller than six
feet, and nine of the newcomers weight at least
250 pounds. .

After discussing each of the new Panthers,
Chryst announced that the Pitt football spring
game will be played at Bethel Park High School
on Friday, April 12. ' _ ..

“In less than a month, we’re starting spring
ball,” Chryst said. “And We’re going to ﬁnish our
spring ball at Bethel Park. We’re pretty excited
about that. We’re playing at a nice high school"
— a beautiful facility.”

The four players who enrolled early will
have the advantage of participating in those
springpractices, while the other 23 members
of the 2013 Pitt recruiting classwillhave to wait
until the summer to join their new coaches and
teammates. I

W   HOOPS

Junior forward Asia Logan struggled,

. shooting 2—for-11 from the ﬁeld. While at-

tempting a steal at the 11-minute mark of
the second half, she immediately fell to the

. ﬂoor in pain, re—injuring her right shoulder

and moving to the bench for the remainder

_ of thelcontest.

Without one of its best players, Pitt was
resilient throughout the ﬁnal 10 minutes,
staying within six points the rest of the way. A
layup by junior guard Marquel Davis with 9.1
seconds left tied the game for the Panthers
for the ﬁrst time since 17:47 of the second
half, when the teams were tied at 47.

Davis then stole the ball from Friars se-
nior guard Symone Roberts with less than
ﬁve seconds left to deny Providence a chance
at a buzzer—beater, sending the contest to its
ﬁrst overtime. 4

“I saw an opening to the post in front of
me, and as a guard, I knew I had to attack the
post player,” Davis said of her game-tying

shot. “She was going for a block, so I knew, V

and I had to adjust my shot and I got it to go.”
Providence opened up a four-point lead

' _ in overtime; but the Panthers wou1dn’t quit.

A Friars turnover with 31.5 seconds left

A and Pitt still down four allowed the Panthers

to climb back in the game by ﬁnally convert-
ing clutch free throws. ,

Then, Kiesel provided the game’s most
memorable moment. _-
