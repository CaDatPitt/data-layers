diverse problems in Africa

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

The drought in Ethiopia is but one
part of the crisis facing Africa,
according to Timothy T. Thahane,
the former ambassador to the Unit-
ed Stated from the Kingdom of
Lesotho.

In two speeches sponsored by the
World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh
on Thursday, Thahane explored
troubles facing Africa such as
drought, rapid population growth,

Bank. He said short-term help is
good, but African nations, need
long-term help from the world’s
developed countries.

“For the last two years, Africa has
experienced a drought the likes of
which has never been seen before,”
said Thahane, who‘ commended
U.S. relief efforts to the area. But
this is short-term help, he said. The
long-term problem becomes evident

research

still controversial

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

No. 180-1161, an adult rat,
remains motionless as Jeff Balzar, a
lab technician, shaves its head. Two
blunt thick rods are then screwed
into the rat’s ear until both have
reached the inner ear bone. The rat is
now prepared for an experiment
that will damage a portion of its
brain.

Balzar takes a surgical knife and
makes an incision into the rat’s
shaved head. He turns on a machine
and begins to drill two minute holes.
After the drill has penetrated the
skull, two hollow needles are
inserted into the holes. Slowly, 180
micrograms of dopamine, a chemi-
cal that hinders specific neurons and
can cause brain damage at certain
dosages circulates into the rat’s
brain. Three minutes and twenty

seconds later, the experiment is

over.

Specifically, No. I80-l 161 is being
used by University of Pittsburgh
scientists to study a type of brain
damage commonly referred to as
Parkinson’s disease (a degenerative
disorder of the brain that slowly
decreases the ability of the nervous
system to function.)

No. 180-116] is one of the 29,586
rats that were used for laboratory
research at the University of Pitts-
burgh from September 1983 to Sep-
tember 1984. Althougha majority of
the research animals are rats and
mice, research is conducted on dogs,
cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, primates,
sheep, chickens, pigs and cattle.
After the experiments, some are
returned to the breeders, and some,
because of physical or mental dam-
age, are exterminated.

In a move that will require even
more research animals, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is planning for a
new cancer research institute as an
addition to the medical school.
“Research will become a vital lifeline
to the university,” stated Dr. Leo
Kuntz, acting associate provost for
research.

The increased attention to
research at Pitt has aggravated the
debate between scientists and
animal-protection activists.

“We need to be able to test our
ideas, and we need to do so on living
organisms,” said Dr. Michael Zig-
mond, one ofthe three collaborating
scientists in the above experiment.
“If society wants us to find answers
to cancer, there is no other way,” he
said.

Dan Kinney, from the Mobiliza-

tion of Animals, an international
coalition, stated: “Our main goal is
to educate the public. We believe
animals are sensuous creatures ca-
pable of suffering and deserving of
rights.”

The movement to defend animals
against mistreatment has been going
on for centuries. Groups such as the
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals and the National
Anti—Vivisection Society have been
concerned with animal welfare for
years. Recent developments within
the animal movement have focused
these two groups’ attention upon
national and state legislation to pro-
mote animal rights — that is,>legisla-
tion to regulate the exploitation of
animals in research, industry and on
the farm. '

Currently, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture provides guidelines
for the care and maintenance of
laboratory animals. Individual insti-

V tutions, depending upon state codes,

are delegated responsibility to moni-
tor the welfare of the animals during
experiments.

“We make sure that their cages are
clean, that they are fed properly and
that they are healthy. Once an
animal leaves our care, the responsi-
bility lies with the researcher, yet, he
has to justify what he is doing to the
University Committee. If pain is a
part of the study, then the researcher
must justify why there aren’t any
alternatives,” said Dr. Paul Bram-
son, the /veterinarian at Pitt’s
Research Facility, where the ani-
mals are kept pending the
experiments.

Members ofthe University Com-
mittee are appointed by the vice
president of health sciences. The
committee consists of researchers, a
member of the community and
Bramson.

“All of us, when we started, had

. misgivings about using animals,”

said Zigmond. “I can still remember
when I had to sacrifice my first rat. It
bothered me a lot. I never got over
it.”

Dr. Peter Safar, a full-time Pitt
professor and current director of the
Resuscitation Research Center,
commented, “What we do around
here often raises a number of ethical
and emotional questions.” Safar’s
research is concerned with inducing

heart attacks in dogs. While the dogs A

are under anesthesia, he attempts to
extend the time between heart attack
and recovery.

Safar continued: “What I try to do
is answer a few basic questions.
First, is animal research necessary?
Our field [cardio-pulminary resusci-
tation] can only be done on live dogs
because their recovery system

developed nation essential fordevel-
oping capital and technology. But he
said there is a perception with many
that foreign aid is “like pouring
water into the sand.”

Thahane refuted the assertion cit-
ing such East Asian countries as
India, Thailand and Korea as exam-
ples of countries in which foreign aid
has been beneﬁcial. H-e said that
experts had written off India as a
“helpless case.” Because of foreign
aid, Thahane claimed, India now
experiences a six-percent annual
economic growth and is self-
sufficient in producing food for its
millions.

The present crisis in Africa has
different origins, explained Tha-
hane. Natural calamities such as
pounded by disasters caused by man
such as war and deforestation. He
said thecrisis is compounded by
rapid population growth. Given the
present growth rate of three percent,
he predicted that Africa’s popula-

tion of 385 million will double in 20
years.

The total debt of African nations
is $48 billion, said Thahane, and he
predicted that in the next few years It
will also double. The World Bank is
working with African governments
to provide revenue to service their
debts, he said, and many countries
see the organization as a partner in
development.

The World Bank is an interna- ,
tional organization established to .

lend money to developing nations.
With I48 member nations, the Unit-
ed States is a primary shareholder
providing much of its funds. The
World Bank’s lending program has
averaged $11 billion since its incep-
tion, said Thahane. Last year it
loaned $415 million to developing
countries.

African nations borrowing money
from the World Bank are urged to
establish agricultural reform,

become attractive to foreign invest-
ment, diversify economies that are
too dependent on one commodity
and improve the country’s infra-
structure so that goods that are pro-
duced can reach a market.

“Transition cannot be achieved
without pain,” said Thahane. “But
in the long run, we are confident that
Africa can feed itself.”

While agricultural productivity
must improve, said Thahane, the
industrialization of Africa is impor-
tant in the long run. And it is essen-
tial that governments provide an
infrastructure in Africa that will
allow the private sector to develop,
he said.

It is the long-term economic crisis
that the World Bank addresses,
stated Thahane. He added that it is
this long-term problem that con-
cerns most African governments
which the international community
must not lose sight of.

Symposium salutes Fred Rogers

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Over 300 child care specialists,
educators and parents from across
the country attended a symposium
last Saturday to honor Fred Rogers’
accomplishments in child develop-
ment and to explore the relationship
-between the child, the story and
television.

“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,”
the longest-running program on
children’s television, continues to
reach over seven million households
per week and is recognized by psy-
chologists and educators across the
country as the finest example of
children’s programming. In 1976,
Fred Rogers named Pitt’s School of
Library and Information Science as
the repository of the show’s video
archives, acknowledging its long-
interest in service to
children.

“What we are here today to
explore is the relationship between
the child, the story and television,”
said conference director Dr. Mar-
garet Mary Kimmel. “And to cele-
brate 30 years of an artists work in a
medium that affects us all -
television.”

The symposium, sponsored by the
School of Libraryand Information
Science, brought together educators
from Yale and the University of
Pennsylvania to explore and discuss
the relationship of children and
television.

Dr. George Gerbner, dean of
communication at the University of

Pennsylvania, began the explora-_

tion with a discussion of storytelling
in the age of telecommunications.
“Most of our world we have
accumulated through stories that we
hear and tell,” said Gerber. “The
only way to illuminate the hidden

development of life is through fic-
tion or drama  or make believe."

Gerber followed the storytelling
process of humanization through
the industrial revolution and into
modern-day life as it takes form in
television.

“Television is a ritual that has
invaded the American home,” said
Gerber. “For the first time in his-
tory, storytelling is developed by a
small group of distinct corporations
that have great power.” He placed
the television accomplishments of
Rogers in this scheme.

“The world that television pre-
sents to our children is one of mass
production, fright and shame, and
the only way to deal with strangers is
to be suspicious and mistrustful,”
said Gerber. “It is in this world that
we have the historical significance of
‘Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.’ He

“Child’s play illuminates the
events of their inner and outer
world, and is the key for understand-
ing the human condition,” said Sing-
er. She explained the adult process
of illumination using Piaget's four
stages of play. “Our sensory motor
play could be walking along the
beach. Our practice play could be
tennis; our symbolic play, playing
with thoughts, and our rules and
games play tennis again,” she said.

Using Piaget’s conservation stage
(the method ofjudging number and
amount for children ages two to
seven), Singer cited her studies with
pre-school children, Yale graduates
and adults between 30 and 40 years
old, using glasses of vodka with her
party guests and juice with nursery
school children to demonstrate that
we as adults still depend on percep-
tion. “Wenever grow out of our

relationship between the child, the story and
television, and to celebrate 30 years of an
artist's work in a medium that affects us all —

television. ”

helps construct the dreams that
heal.”

Dr. Dorothy Singer, co-director
of the Family Television Research
and Consultation Center at Yale
University, then addressed the topic
of children’s psychology. Using
examples of her own research and a
slide show of comic illustrations, she
explained Rogers’ work as combin-
ing the theories of Freud, Piaget,
and Erikson, and explained how we,
as ‘adults, continue to experience our
childhood development stages.

Singer explained the separation of

discussed how ‘Mister Rogers’

ies together,” said Singer. “He uses

Bakery site of explosion

A homemade bomb made from firecrackers was the cause of an
explosion that occurred Thursday evening at the Roma Bakery on

Several residents ofthe area claimed that there were two explosions.
“Around 10:55 there was a noise that sounded like a gunshot, and
several minutes later, there was a loud explosion,” said Debbie
Roberts, a Pitt student who lives near the bakery.

Officers Kaczmarek and Benz from police station No. 4 reported
that they were in the vicinity of the bakery when they heard an
explosion. Seeing smoke coming from the bakery, they proceeded to
investigate. “There was a strong odor of gunpowder, and the glass
entrance as well as the front display window were blown out,”
reported the officers. The investigation has been turned over to the

information more easily. He makes
everything clear and acts as a surro-
gate father to bring us back to reality
and to let us know that everything is
OK."

The symposium concluded with a
showing of clips from previous
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”
shows. The clips were presented by

.Hedda Sherapan, associate pro-

ducer of the show.

Sherapan said that the most
importantaspect of the program to
Rogers is that he listens to the chil-
dren. “What he wants to be is
another honest adult in the life of a
child,” said Serapan.

Finally, Rogers and Kimmel
joined the previous speakers in a
panel discussion of questions pres-
ented by members of the audience.

Rogers, who in addition to being a
composer, writer and psychologist is
also a minister, spoke for the first
and only time to the audience as he
sat with the other panel members.

“Can you imagine how I feel
inside right now?” he asked the
audience. “To think that they [Sin-

ger, Gerbner] would recognize that
we’re somehow a part of children’s
literature.”

In response to a question about
the effects that television has on
children, Rogers said: “The biggest
part of the drama is what we feel
within us. We aren’t just one thing.
As we watch a television program,
we enrich the program by what we
are.” ‘

Grim Situation

“The budget situation is pretty grim,” said Presi-
dent Posvar in his report to the board of trustees. He
was referring to the “public sector” of the budget —
those funds received from the government.

The university requested $101.1 million, a seven-
percent increase over last year’s budget, from the
state of Pennsylvania for the next fiscal year. Gover-
nor Richard Thornburgh has recommended only a
four-percent increase, or $84 million. Unless the
$17.1 million difference between these two figures
can be obtained from the state legislature, Pitt stu-
dents can expect a sizable tuition increase next year.

“Tuition increases are a fact of life, as is inﬂation,”
President Posvar said after the trustees meeting.

The cost of attending the University of Pittsburgh
was halved when the school first became a state-
related institution. Time has long since eliminated
that advantage. As the cost of operating an institu-
tion of Pitt’s magnitude has grown rapidly, the per-
Ssfltﬂﬁé 81‘ {Hat asst ruiiueu By the state has
dwindled.

Tuition at Pitt has steadily climbed since becom-
ing a state-related university. Tuition today is almost
twice what it was only 10 years ago, and for the last
two years Pitt has raised tuition by 19.9 percent, well
above the rate of inﬂation.

Next week, President Posvar and other adminis-
tration officials will make a presentation before the
state Appropriations Committee in an attempt to
garner additional funds from the legislature.

The Pitt News urges all University of Pittsburgh
students to contact their hometown legislators
immediately, either by letter or telephone. Let your
senators know how critical state funding is to your
education.’

The administration has made it clear that tuition
increases are inevitable. We may be in a position to
affect the size of that increase. Unless the state legis-
lature can be convinced to cover the $17.1 million
shortfall between money appropriated and what is
needed, it will be Pitt students who will have to pay

~ that $17.1 million.

Your vote is powerful. Threaten to use it and
watch what happens.

Selfless

I am writing in response to Kevin
Bold's letter, “Liberal Error," which
was published on Feb. 13 in The Pitt
News. Although there has been neg-
ative response to the letter, specifi-
cally by Robert Palaschak
(“Insensitive,” Feb. 20), I would like
to commend Mr. Bold for some of
his rationally sound statements.

First, Mr. Bold states, “No
rational philosophy has ever taught
that the productive individual’s duty
is to ensure the survival of those who
could be working but are not.” How-
ever, such a philosophy is not popu-
lar in today’s society; in fact, it is
considered evil.

Instead, the majority of society
supports a philosophy where an
individual is asked to serve the needs
and interests of society above and
against one’s own. Such a philo-
sophy is based on the moral premise
that men can achieve good by turn-
ing the productive individual into a
sacrificial animal, thus sacriﬁcing
wealth to need.

Also, Mr. Bold states that welfare
and Medicare are based on the false
premise that people deserve some-

thing simply because they “need” it,

as opposed to working for it and
earning it. These people are looters
who struggle to exist solely by para-
sitizing productive and wealthy indi-
viduals. They insist that they have
justification — need. But need is not
a claim!

Finally, I would like to address
Robert Palaschak. No, Mr. Pala-
schak, I do not call you a wimp, a
bleeding heart or even a liberal for
expressing your “sensitive” feelings.
I call you selﬂess.

Ludicrous

This letter is in response to Mr.
William Taylor, whose letter (“More
Hi-Tech"), appeared in the Feb. 22
edition of The Pitt News. In his let-
ter, Mr. Taylor cites five of his own
personal recommendations for the
much debated Five-year Plan pro-
posed by the university.

The first of these proposals is the
dissolution of the rhetoric commun-
ications department. Mr. Taylor’s
justification for this is that he is
“tired of a department that does
nothing but provide a hiding place
for jocks and unintelligent people."

Mr. Taylor recommends that the
space would be more aptly occupied
by a computer center.

I will not go on citing Mr. Taylor’s
four subsequent proposals because
they are more ludicrous than his
first. Therefore, I conclude this
rebuttal by asking Mr. Taylor a sim-
ple question. At the end of each of
your proposals you recommend
computer centers to replace each of
the abolished departments. Tell us
then, why are you wasting your time
(and surely your money) here at Pitt
when you could have all the compu-
ter space one could possibly need
just a few short blocks away at
Carnegie-Mellon University? Aren’t
you intelligent enough or is this

Not no. 33

In the game against Boston Col-
lege, Coach Chipman inserted four
new starters. The Pitt News staff
would want us to believe that Coach
Chipman also has Charles Smith
distinguished as Demetreus Gore
(see sports section, The Pitt News,
Feb. 25). If Pitt’s own sports writer
could not tell who's wearing No. 32
and who’s wearing No. 33, perhaps
it's time Charles,Smith be given the
recognition that he deserves. How
about a T-shirt for Charlie?! He
stands tall among the Big East elite
like Patrick Ewing and Chris Mul-
lin. What do they have in common?
They both wear a T-shirt.

Beware

For those of you who are abusers
of library services, heed this warn-
ing. By gutting articles from maga-

photoduplication, you tarnish the
scholarly ethics and qualities
entailed in your degrees, should you
complete your degrees.

Not only are you disparaging your
own academic careers, but you are
also blunting the efforts of other stu-

ate themselves from the
“state-school” image of inferior edu-
cational attainment. In short, keep
your mitts off the merchandise. It is
absurd to ﬁnd that one cannot write

Why I Like Midterms

Midterms just don’t seem to last
quite long enough. Just as I was get-
ting used to life during the college
midterm period, it was over. You
see, I kind of enjoy midterms.

That’s right, but please don’t get
me wrong. I find little pleasure in
suffering through those awful tests.
I’m not crazy. And I equally hate

_ studying for them.

Actually, I enjoy midterms
because they give me a reasonable
excuse to become an academic bum.
An academic bum, by the way, is
merely a student who, while prepar-
ing for midterms, is permitted to
neglect most personal upkeep. I am
an academic bum.

Last week, a friend asked me why
I looked so bad. Peering at him
through the slits between my eyelids,
I yawned and exclaimed,
“Midterms.”

He shook his head and said, “I
should have known.” He under-
stood. Everyone understands.

You see, the midterm period is a
time when I don't have to shave, for

instance. Normally, I have to get up‘

early in the morning so I can shave
before going to school. I’ve even
missed the bus while attempting to
look presentable. During midterms,
though, students don’t have to look
preseﬁtable. I can let my whiskers

grow, and nobody will care. They
understand.

Also, my clothes don’t have to be
cleaned or pressed. I can spend the
entire midterm period in the same

T-shirt and faded jeans without

anyone giving me a second glance. I
am even permitted to sleep in those
same clothes as long as I do so while
studying. People understand.

As my hair grows long, several
people have subtly accused me of
being a radical hippie. However,
when I explained that I am in the
middle of midterms, they excused
me without further questions. They
understand.

My parents constantly grind on
me about making my bed. They dis-
approve of the way I leave the
blankets heaped in a pile in the mid-
dle of my bed. They stop scolding
me, though, during midterms. I
guess even they understand.

Cleaning my room is certainly out
of the question during midterms. I
simply let the dust clutter through-
out the room. My clothes gather on
the end of my bed until they flow out
onto the floor. Spiders have a field
day. For once, I can justifiably live
like a slob. You know, it’s nice some-
times, and people understand.

The midterm period also gives me
a chance to catch up on my textbook

assignments. I realize the assign-
ments probably should have been
completed before midterms, but, oh
well. Midterms seem to offer me the
needed incentive to read. In this
way, midterms become helpful.

I find that I don’t need to exercise
during midterms. You see, midterms
become a useful dietary aid. Since
I’m too busy cramming for exams, I
have very little time to eat. There-
fore, I lose weight and I don’t have
the needed energy to exercise. In
other words, I can legitimately be
lazy.

My mood seems to remain cheer-
ful during midterms. I guess my
mind and body are so worn out that
I simply don’t care about things. I
walk around dazed but smiling. But
it’s midterms, so people understand.

When midterms are finally over,
students then have a good reason to
celebrate for at least a week before
getting back into the real world.

When midterms end, though, I
will get depressed. I will have to
shave again. My parents will get on
me again about making my bed and
cleaning my room. I will have to get
a haircut. But I’m looking toward
the future now. You see, finals are
coming. 

From Where I Stand / Tobi Sanes

On Patrol With Oakland’s No. 4

I left home Saturday night with
mixed feelings about the story I was
starting on that night. With tension,
a little fear and a lot of excitement, I
had my first encounter with the Pre-
cinct No. 4 Oakland Police. Unfor-
tunately, instead of waiting for me to
come to them for an interview, they
decided to approach me with the
usual parley of “Excuse me, miss,
can I see your owner’s card and your
driver’s license, please?”

I llkE ttl tllllik bf myself as caver-
ing allangles of a story, but the hilar-
ious situation I now found myself in
was carrying things a little too far.
Anyway, I accepted the ticket gra-
ciously offered to. me by the nice
officer and once again was on my
way to Precinct No. 4. (By the way,
my ticket was for running a stop sign
on Ophelia Street in south Oakland,
so watch yourselves down there.)

The station is located on Louisa
Street in Oakland. Making sure I
was parked in ‘a spot that was not a
yellow line, I went into the station.

First of all, to dispel any myths of a
“Hill Street Blues” type of atmos-
phere, I was the only civilian in the
large entry room with a desk ser-
geant and a night lieutenant on duty.
I asked for Lt. Joyce and told him
my story and of my clearance OK
that I had received earlier from
Inspector Ward and Superintendent
Coll. _

I must have looked a little intimi-
dating with my backpack and tape
recorder strapped with all my plug-
in wires and microphones, but Lt.
Joyce didn’t seem to mind. He told
me that the afternoon shift would be
over in an hour (it was 9:30 p.m.),
but he said he would call in two
officers off the streets to take me
around until the night shift came on

at ll p.m.

Let me insert here that there are
three regular shifts and one irregular
shift everyday. The day shift runs
from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., the afternoon
shift runs from 3 to 11 p.m., and the
night shift runs from 11 p.m. to 7
a.m. There is a special one-car shift
every night from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.

Officers Ray Kain and Savannah
Berk arrived five minutes later to
pick me up. I’m glad I wore jeans
because they stuck me in the back
seat. I casually glanced around and
noticed a red smear about a foot
away from my face. I noticed this in
most of the cars and jokingly
remarked that it might be blood.
They told me that it probably was. I
took things seriously after that.

There wasn’t much action that
turn. We pulled over three minor
traffic violators who were all
released —— the drivers of all three
cars were struck with sudden amne-
sia and needed directions to get out
of Oakland. Officer Kain told me
that 90 percent of the people they
pull over are just plain lost. That
came as no surprise to me, consider-
ing the people I know in Oakland.

The heaviest workload for the
police falls on weekdays and Friday
nights. It being Saturday, I had
plenty of time for questions.

I learned that calls made to the
91 1 emergency number go through a
center downtown. Operators in a
room with about 10 phones take
your information, process it on a
card and hand the card to a dis-

patcher, who dispatches the closest .

car to the area to check out the call.
Only the center downtown can dis-
patch cars. Service will be much fas-
ter if you call the emergency number
and not the local precinct.

A lot of police work is based on
instinct, even though most calls and
arrests are made from being dis-
patched to a business or home.

It was now 10:30 p.m. and time to
head back to the station to change
shifts. I was assigned to accompany
officers Ron Franz and Phil Stack.
They checked the number of tickets
in the car and then signed the car in.

Our first stop during the night
shift was at the infamous Pancake
House. We stopped for coffee, and
as I learned in two nights with the
officers, they need it.

At 11:30 p.m., Officer Franz,
Officer Stack and I headed for the
Hazelwood patrol beat. The first call
we received was from Dawson Street
—— a car was blocking the driveway.
By the time we arrived, the car was
gone. I found out that although not
many tags are done on the night
shift, calls are usually answered.

At this point, I asked them if their
feelings at the beginning of the shift
differed from how they felt at the
end of the shift. Both said that
there’s really no feeling when they
start. If they’re busy, they’re not so
tired by the time they finish.

The officers said that the majority
of calls involve domestic disturban-
ces. These situations are tricky, since
a husband may be in the right or the
wife may change her mind about her
accusations. All they can really do is
mediate and help to work things out
— psychologists, marriage counse-
lors and policemen, all in one.

According to the officers, there is
nothing more dangerous or risky
than being a traffic stop. They do.
not know who they have pulled over
and must approach them carefully.

People’s misconceptions about
policemen contribute to their wari-

Midterms.

Did you ever wonder why we
have to have these ridiculous
things? Why is it that we must
prove how much we've learned in
one lengthy swoop ofthe pencil?
You would think that we would
be much better off taking a
weekly exam to test our knowl-
edge, and then we’d add up all
those exams and have a final
grade. Simple.

But here’s what we’re stuck
with.

We go to classes on occasion,
even after promising at the
beginning of the term that we
would not let hell or high water
stop us from attending class.
After a while, it seems that we get
complacent. We know what the
professor is going to say before
he says it; we understand every-
thing anyway. Its all in the book,
right?

So we wake up one morning
with a kind of lazy feeling that
mixes with a feeling of worldly
knowledge. We feel as though no
measly professor could teach us
any more about biology or psy-
chology or history than what we
already know. Besides, it’s all in
the book. We successfully (with a
few pangs of remorse) skip our
first class.

Of course, we don’t know what
it is we’ve stepped into. We don’t
know the trap that'we’ve set. But
we’re caught. Another class

Midterm Miscalculations

looms ahead. Though we’ve cer-
tainly learned no more since
skipping the last class, that same
feeling of worldly knowledge
overcomes us. Ah, what the hell.
It's all in the book.

About the time we’ve missed

two or three classes, we dig up

' the old syllabus to see where the
class is now. Whoops. Only two
classes till midterms. That’s
alright, we’ll get the notes off of
someone. Besides, it’s all in the
book.

Suddenly, we begin to think
very philosophically.

How is some silly exam going
to tell anyone how much we
really know? We already know
how our spirit feels. A test is an
insult to our intelligence, not to
mention our existential being. Be
sides, should we return, the pro-
fessor will just chastise and
embarrass us in front of the
whole class. .

So, the midterm day comes
and we go to class and get a C- or
something on the midterm. After
an hour or two ofcallingthe pro-
fessor an incoherent doof
(among other things), we admit
that the fault might lie on our
own shoulders and vow to go to
every class from this point for-
ward. This vow lastsfor about a
week and a half. Then it starts
again.

Why did I do the column in
third person? Because I certainly
wouldn’t stoop to such a level in
my own academic pursuits.

But listen. I gotta go study for
a midterm. I didn’t take many
notes, though. Ah, it’s all in the
book.

ness. Most people regard policemen
as only policemen, forgetting that
they are also human underneath the
uniform. ‘People don’t like being
reprimanded for doing something
wrong, and the dislike is especially
more so when they are caught doing
something illegal.

For instance, a call comes through
about a burglary taking place. An
officer pulls a gun, yet no shooting
takes place. The burglar is appre-
hended and taken to the car. A win-
dow separates the officers from the
burglar in the back seat, preventing ,
him from verbally or physically
abusing them.

Evidence has to be clear and com-
pact for the courts. The defense tries
its best to suppress the evidence, so it
must be cohesive and iron-tight.

First, they take the lawbreaker
downtown to the jailhouse, find a
parking place and go in to start their
paperwork, finish it and set a date
for the preliminary court hearing —
a lot of details to go through. Frus-
trations abound.

The average policeman is held up
for an inordinately long amount of
time before he is allowed to go back
on patrol. (OK, it might not be bad
enough to cry over, but it gives a
little more insight on their situation,
I lwpe.)

Anyway, a drunk kid walking in
the middle of the street approached
the car. The policemen meted out
what’s called “straight justice,”
which means that they handled the

situation by merely telling the kid to 

go home. They did not get bothered
by the incident and said it happened
often.

I asked them if they were ever
involved in any street chasr: and
they said not usually. It seems that
there is something called “hot pur-
suit procedures,” which are some-

thing the city puts out so that civil “

lawsuits against policemen and acci-
dents that may happen during a

p.

high-speed chase won’t occur. The 

policemen were very sure, though, 

when they told me that “justice does 

_ prevail,” and that the legal system ;

E

that we now have may not be per- j

feet, but it’s the best we have.

Now for some statistics: The city ‘
of Pittsburgh is composed of nine j

precincts with South Hills being the

largest at 15 square miles. The most ._
hectic station is Precinct No. 5, 1
which covers East Liberty. The city 1
covers 20,000 calls a month. The 7
officers draw according to seniority e.

for their shifts, and they rotate them
every three months. The Pittsburgh
city budget calls for only 1,000
police workers, including desk
attendants and clerks.

At this point,. it was 3 a.m. After 
saying goodnight to" officers Franz 
and Stack and ‘thanking the night 
desk sergeant, Calfo, for his help, I 3
said goodbye for the night and ;

promised to come back the next

night for the late shift, once again, I
hoping that some excitement or ‘
major happenings might occur that I

evening.

strongly resembles that of humans.

“Second, do we have the right to
shorten the life of an animal? Yes, if
it beneﬁts our own lives. Third, can
you do the tests without causing
pain? Yes, by the use of anesthesia.
Can you control suffering? No, anx-
iety and stress are innate to both
animals and humans. Finally, are
you providing [the animal] with_ a
comfortable and clean home? Yes,
we place emphasis upon that here."

The lack of legal guidelines, the
increase in research projects and
heightened public awareness about
the uses of animals in research have
prompted members of both the
scientiﬁc community and the animal
activists to search for answers.

Dr. Zigmond stated: “We in the "

scientific community have a ten-
dency to operate in secret. The
animal rights people have been able
to portray their view to an eager
public. We really don’t have that

The i=tiii;N‘é»t?§';‘Ii\5Ionaa§§"'M*ér¢H‘4j’T19'83 

many differences; we should begin
to talk to each other."

John Picone, president of Friends
for Animals, a local student organi-
zation, commented: “As a biology
student, and in keeping contact with
researchers and administrators, I
believe there exists a willingness to
sit down and talk. As to how far
things will go, well ...”

As of yet, no talks have begun.
Repetitive research and whether it is
necessary is a major concern of both
researchers and animal-rights
activists.

Scientists cite the need to test and
retest their research as imbedded
in the scientific method. Limitations
or restrictions, they claim, will

hinder scientific advancement. Dr. »

Edward Stricker, co-researcher with
Zigmond on Parkinson's disease,
explained: “You know the story

about the six blind men, each feeling
a different part of an elephant. One
discovers the trunk, the other the tail
and so forth. Each is right, but each
is not accurate. In science we are like
individual blind men: all a little bit
right, but until we have gathered the
various information separately [and
studied all the results together as a
whole] we cannot determine
accuracy.”

Dan Kinney views repetitious
research this way: “It is useless.
Recently, Reynolds Tobacco funded
Harvard to study smoking and the

effects upon primates. This has
already been done 30 or 40 years
ago. We all know that smoking is
not good for your lungs. My ques-
tion is: Do you have to subject mon-
keys and baboons to lung cancer to
confirm something already known?”

According to animal-rights acti-
vists, a solution to the useless repeti-
tion would be to set up a federal
“clearing house"that would monitor
and review all the funding allocated
to researchers. Currently, the acti-
vists say, the only communication
between researchers is throughjour-
nals, which provide a minimal

appraisal of research activity.

Dr. Harold Feinberg, a professor
of pharmacology at the University
of Illinois, agreed: “40 percent to 60
percent of all animal research could
be done away with without an effect
on human welfare.” He cited a psy-
chological experiment in which
researchers blinded animals to test
the effects of blindness on sexuality.
He asserted that the experiment was
wasteful because the same results
couldlhave been obtained through
clinical surveys of blind humans.

Picone commented: “I can under-
stand the argument that we have the
right to shorten the life of an animal
to save human lives. But then again,
we must look at individual cases.
This is such an ambiguous issue, and
so far determined solely upon indi-
vidual interpretation of what is
moral and ethical. We really could
use some guidelines.”

A father's rights

BOONEVILLE, Iowa (UPI) -— A
man in Booneville, Iowa, is suing to
keep his former ﬁancee from having
an abortion.

Charles Buel said the child is his,
and he has rights as a father to pro-
tect its life. He’s already won a tem-
porary restraining order stopping
the abortion.

Buel‘s lawyer said the suit is not an
anti-abortion crusade but an
attempt to define a father’s rights.
He believes it‘s the only case of its
kind in the country.

Buel said he lived with his fiancee
for seven months, and they had
planned to marry until she left after
a fight last month.

The judge granted the restraining
order last week and will rule on Fri-
day whether it should be made
permanent.

Mining strike ends

BRITAIN (UPI) — The longest

An emergency conference of
mineworkers’ union leaders voted
yesterday by a reported margin of
just 98-91 to end the strike against
the nation’s coal mines. The end of
the strike comes just one week short
of its first anniversary.

The union members still on strike
will be going back on Tuesday with-
out any agreement with the state-
appointed National Coal Board.

Miners waiting in the pouring rain
shouted, “Traitor!” and, “You have
sold us out!” when union president
Arthur Scargill emerged with the
decision. Some screamed that they
were not going back.

But about half of the country’s
184,000 miners already had gone
back - nearly l0,000 in the last
week alone, as miner support for the
long walkout crumbled.

The issue that started the strike —
the Coal Board's plans to close 20
unprofitable mines and lay off 20
thousand miners — still stands with-
out a settlement.

Pepsi controversy

(UPI) — House Speaker “Tip"
O’Neill said he sees nothing wrong
with Geraldine Ferraro’s decision to
do a television commercial, but oth-
ers do not agree.

O'Neill commented in response to
reporters’ questions about Ferraro’s
television commercial , for Diet
Pepsi. She was paid a reported $500
thousand for the ad.

Defending Ferraro, O’Neill said,
“I think it is great if you’ve got the
class, talent, ability and looks to be
picked for that.”

Asked if he would accept an offer
to make a commercial himself,

‘Neill said he'd
consideration."

Pepsi officials say Ferraro was
chosen because her vice-presidential
nomination was “an extraordinary
event at the heart of which is an
extraordinary woman."

Pepsi president Roger Enrico said
people who criticize Ferraro for
making the commercial are “taking
this too seriously.” He said “We’re
not making a political statement
with this commercial.”

The question is whether promi-
nent politicians should make
commercials.

Worst city

(UPI) — Despite a Rand McNally
study that put Yuba City, Calif., at
the bottom of the list in the Places
Rated Almanac, residents of that
city feel that it is a good place to live.

Yuba City Mayor Chuck Pappa-
george said, “Quite honestly, I think
it’s a slap in the face." But the mayor
said the survey gives him a “good
opportunity" to tell the country all
the good things about Yuba City. He
added that, “If we were second to
last, we wouldn’t have gotten all this
publicity." ,

The city that finished in that next
to last position was Pine Bluff, Ark.

Arsonist convicted

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — A Pitts-

Blastoff delayed

(UPI) —— This week's ﬂight of the
space shuttle Challenger has been
canceled because of trouble with an
onboard satellite. The cancellation
has thrown the shuttle Iauch sched-
ule into disarray. The launch had
been scheduled for this Thursday.

Space agency officials said
workers will now haul the Chal-
Ienger back to a hangar to remove a
$100 million tracking and data relay
satellite.

Charles Redmond of NASA said
the shuttle Discovery’s scheduled
March 22 flight also was canceled
and the two missions will be com-
bined into one.

It was a bitter setback for NASA,
which has been under enormous
pressure to keep the launch schedule
on track to attract commercial cus-
tomers and prove the shuttle system
is reliable. -

lnterest Rate
Retained

(UPI) — Governor Thornburgh
today signed into law a bill retaining
the I8-percent maximum interest
rate on a large number of credit
cards used by state residents.

The rate was scheduled to drop to
15 pecent on March 25, the point at
which it was before being increased
in 1982. The bill signed by Governor
Thornburgh retains the l8-percent
rate for three more years. Under the
law, state residents cannot be
charged more than I8-percent inter-
est on all retail credit cards and those
cards issued by Pennsylvania-based
bank/credit operations.

Thornburgh said that allowing
the rate to drop would discourage

creditors from issuing cards to some’

customers and result in higher prices
for some retail goods.

The governor added that permit-
ting the rate to decrease would risk
the jobs ‘of Pennsylvanians who
work for bank/credit operations.
Those operations, he said, would
possibly move out of state where
higher rates are allowed.

Digging a deep
hole

NEW YORK (UPI) - New
York’s police commissioner said
Bernhard Goetz is like a “man with a
long shovel in soft soil, digging a
deep hole.” Commissioner Ben-
jamin Ward said yesterday that
Goetz is talking his support away,
and sooner or later, the hole will
collapse on him.

Goetz admitted to shooting four
teenagers who he said demanded $5
from him on a subway last
December.

He broke months of silence last
week, saying New Yorkers should
arm themselves against crime, and a
taped confession revealed that after
Goetz shot four times, he stood over
one of his victims and said: “You
don’t look so bad. Here’s another.”

While some opinions may_ be

said a majority of Americans questi-

March from the
monument

(UPI) ~ Members of the Ameri-
can agriculture movement are old
hands at putting on demonstrations
in Washington.

Six years ago, they were the ones
who rode into the nation’s capital
atop combines and tractors to focus
attention to their problems.

For many farmers, those prob-
lems have gotten a lot worse since
that first protest.

So, the American agriculture
movement will be at it in force today
— with a march from the Washing-
ton Monument —- through the Agri-
culture Department and on to the
White House.

More conservative farmers,
members of the American Farm
Bureau Federation, will also be in
Washington for annual spring lob-
bying visits.

For both groups, the main con-
cern is the debt crisis that threatens
at least 200,000 farmers. High inter-
est rates and a strong dollar are two
of the major causes.

House leaders are planning a vote
on Tuesday on a Farm Release Bill
already approved by the Senate. But
President Reagan has promised he’ll
veto it.

A five-day walk

(UPI) — Reverend Jesse Jackson
quoted a familiar theme yesterday to
mark the beginning of the re-
enactment of a historic civil rights
march ~ the march from Selma to
Montgomery, Ala.

Jackson told blacks gathered in
Selma that they should not forget
the attack on marchers 20 years ago
by police with tear gas and clubs.
“We choose not to forget history,”
Jackson said, “lest we are doomed to
repeat it.”

Some 5,000 blacks set off yester-
day on the 50-mile walk that is
expected to take five days.

Jackson referred to present-day
civil rights conditions, saying,
“We’re not here to talk about just
who got beat in ‘()5  we’re here to
talk about who‘s being beaten
today."

OSU defeats women gymnasts

The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s gymnastic team
took on seventh-ranked Ohio State
on Saturday night at Trees Hall and
lost 179.4 to 177.45. The home team
was ahead going into the third event
but then the experience and depth of
the Buckeyes became apparent.

‘ I really thought the meet was run
well and everything went smoothly,"
said Pitt athlete Kristy Pieters. “If
there weren’t as many falls, we could
have beaten Ohio State.”

The Pitt gymnasts suffered a few
falls from the balance beam, thus
reducing their chances of upsetting

OSU. However, Pieters, Beth
Waters and Kim Calderone all had
strong performances for the 8-5

Jackie Calderone and Pieters
received an 8.9 and an 8.85. At this
point Ohio State led 44.3-43.95.

The uneven bars came next.
Waters again performed in note-
worthy fashion by earning a tie for
first with an 9.35, and Pitt’s Alisa
Specter took third with a 9.3. The
home team found itself unexpect-
edly ahead.

The falls on the balance beam put
OSU back in the lead to stay. In this
event, Pieters secured second place
with a 9.25.

Only .9 points separated the two
teams going into the last event, the
floor exercise. Pieters scored a 9.4
performing to the theme song from

“Indiana Jones” to win the event.
However, Ohio State took both

and Waters ended up third .with
36.05.

Pieters said that she has been
really pleased with the performance
of the Pitt team so far this season,
considering the fact that there are
seven freshmen on the squad.

Head coach Donna Sanft said she
was happy with the team’s score.
This was Pitt’s second highest score
of the year, but Sanft believes that
her gymnasts should be hitting all
four events by now. “They need to
have a solid performance without
any mistakes," she said.

Sanft said that her gymnasts
looked tired and that she hopes to
have a good practice before Pitt’s
meet Saturday with Maryland and
Clarion.

The,Pi.tt ‘News, Monday, ;March 4,, l985_..- .;

The ﬁght that boxing fans
have been waiting for will take
place on Monday, April 15
(10:30 p.m.), when Marvelous
Marvin Hagler defends his
undisputed world middleweight
title against WBC super welter-
weight champion Thomas
Hearns at Caesars Palace in Las
Vegas, Nev.

It will be telecast on closed cir-
cuit at the Pittsburgh Civic
Arena. Two giant screens, one
each at the north and south ends
of the arena, will accommodate
as many as 16,000.

The 30-year-old Hagler is a
dominant fighter in boxing
today. He has a 60-2-2 record
with 50 knockouts and will enter
the fight unbeaten in nine years,
covering 35 ﬁghts. In his last title

defense in October. Hagler
knocked out No. l-ranked Mus-
tafa Hamsho in three rounds. It
was Hagler's 10th defense of his
crown and his ninth by knock-
out. Only Roberto Duran has
gone 15 rounds against Hagler in
a title defense.

Hagler battled to a 15-round
draw with then-champion Vito
Antuofermo in November 1979,
the only fight he has not won in
the past nineyears. In his second
shot at the belt in September
1980, Hagler defeated defending
champion Alan Minter and won
the title with a technical
knockout

Hearns won the WBA welter-
weight title in August 1980 with a
devastating second-round

knockout of defending cham-
pion Pipino Cuevas and made
successful title defenses against
Luis Primera, Randy Shields
and Pablo Baez before taking on
Sugar Ray Leonard in a title uni-
fication bout in September 1981.
He was leading on the officials
cards when he was stopped by
Leonard in the 14th round for his
only pro loss.

Hearns won his second title in
December 1982 when he scored a
majority decision over defending

champion Benitez to capture the

WBC super welterweight crown.
He has made three title defenses,
outpointing Luigi Minchillo in
12 rounds, scoring a stunning
second-round knockout of
Duran last June and stopping

Hagler-Heams fight shown at Arena

Fred Hutchings in three rounds
in September.

Pfister, Hickman and sophomore
Jodi O’Neil came close to making
national cuts in several events but
according to Belowich missed by
tenths ofa second. “There were a few
events that we were hoping to swim
at Nationals that we just missed
making cuts,” said Belowich. “I
don’t know if it is possible for us to
be ranked in the Top 10 nationally,
as we were striving for, because we
don’t have as many individual races
and relays as we'd need. But any-
thing can happen.

“I’m not at all hanging my head,
Belowich continued. “We accomp-
lished our main goal after winning
the meet, and that was having about
90 percent of the team making life-
time best times. That is more impor-
tant to me than Nationals. All 17
swimmers and three divers scored.
There were some excellent swims by
Nahir Perez in the 200 butterfly, Ste-
phanie Cromwell in the 200 breast
stroke, and Judy Haughton pulled
out the 200 butterﬂy in the last two
one-hundredths of a second.”

Jennifer Brown was awarded
most outstanding diver for the meet,
as she, Tricia Ney and Tricia Shultz
prepare for the NCAA Pre-
Qualifying meet March 14-16 at
Harvard. According to diving coach
Julian Krug, sophomore Kim Proc-
tor had an exceptional meet. “We
could have three divers entered in
the meet," said Krug. “I wasn’t sure
who we’d have in our third spot. I
decided by watching everyone’s per-
formance in practice, and went with
Kim. I’ve been very pleased with her
performance.” ‘

Swimmers Win

. Panthers capture
Big East Crown

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

0 _ . . .
The Pitt men’s swimming and div-

ing team made the tough competi-
tion look weak as they came out on
top 693-604 over second-place Villa-
nova in this weekend’s Big East
Championships at Trees Pool.
Many of the Panthers set both indi-
vidual and meet records as Pitt dom-
inated the Big East for the third year
in a row. Men’s coach Fred Lewis
and women’s coach David Belowich
both received outstanding coach
awards, while Todd Mulzet cap-

/ll'Cd the outstanding diver award
and teammate Richard James was
named outstanding swimmer in the
men’s events.

“The competition was pretty tight
between the team [Pitt], and Villa-
nova had some good guys, but other
than that it wasn’t too tough,"
Mulzet said. “Everybody did good.
The coach is happy. This is right
where he wants us to be — going into
the pre-equals.” Mulzet took first in
the one-meter dive and set a new
meet record in points with a 532.50.

‘.,"ie also took second in the three-
meter dive behind Pitt’s Jack
Shuten. The entire diving team put
forth a remarkable effort by placing
first through fourth in both the one-
and three-meter events.

Richard James earned the out-
standing swimmer award by win-
ning the l00-yard backstroke on
Friday and setting a new meet
record of 151.55 in the 200-yard

aackstroke on Saturday.

the Panthers’ first concern is win-
ning the Eastern Championships
that are being held this weekend at
Cleveland State.

“This was really a team-oriented
meet. We just like to have fun and
swim fast,” said sophomore Frank
Williams after taking first in the 400-
yard individual medley on Friday
night. “Ijust wanted to do my best. I
thank the Lord a whole lot for the

forward to some even tougher com-
petition at the Easterns. “Definitely
our goal is to win and to all have
personally good times. The whole
team didn't shave [their legs] for this
meet, but we’re all going to shave for
the Easterns and do our best."

Other memorable Pitt performan-
ces came from Martin Durkin, who
took first in the 1650-yard freestyle
on Saturday with a 16:05.98, just
short of the meet record. Jim Emore
won the 100-yard butterfly with a
time of 50.16, a new meet record.
“I’m extremely happy with this win,"
Emore said. “I knew the competition
was going to be tough, and it's about
what I expected. Next week at East-
erns I hope to do a lot better — Ijust
want to break 50.” Emore’s brother
Geoff took third in this event and the
two brothers stood side-by-side at
the awards presentation, congratu-
lating one another. “Geoff would
have liked to have gotten second,
but he knows that you can’t expect
to do great every single race,” con-
tinued Emore.

Pitt also won the 400-yard relay
on Saturday, adding to the Pan-
thers’ already leading score. “We
expected to win,” said Charles
Lersch, one member of the Pitt relay

defeating these seven Big East
teams, the Panthers now hope to go
one step further by winning the
Easterns.

Men gymnasts lose to Ohio State‘

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The men’s gymnastics team
hosted the No. 1 team last Saturday
night, losing a tough battle to Ohio
State by the score of 282-267. The
Buckeyes proved strong in every
event, with overall team depth being
the key factor in securing the
victory.

“They are definitely a very reﬁned
squad," commented head coach
Frank D’Amico after the meet.
“Their 48.85 score on high bar is the
highest I’ve ever seen as a coach.”

Although the Buckeyes’ perfor-

mance was exceptional, the Pan-
thers could not be overshadowed,
considering the fact that they had
one of their best meets of the year.
The most notable effort was on the
pommel horse, usually one of Pitt's
weaker events. D’Amico felt it was
their best showing on the horse this
season with all six competitors gain-
ing respectable marks.

All-Eastjunior Mark Klafter con-
tinued his winning streak on the
floor exercise by taking first place
with a 9.65. During last year’s meet
with the Buckeyes, Klafter felt some-
what intimidated during the compe-
tition, but this time it was a little
different.

“Last year I kind of felt like a
number in a crowd,” Klafter stated.

“I did feel some pressure on Satur-
day during my floor routine, but
other than that I just tried to hang
tough with their competition.”

Klafter felt the two events fhat
pulled the Buckeyes to victory were
the pommel horse and the high bar.
Ohio State received near-perfect
scores on" some of these events with
the individual efforts of Tim
Muench (9.9 on pommel horse) and
Robert Playter (9.9 on high bar)
standing out most in Klafter’s mind.

“We got burnt in these events,
plain and simple,” he .said. “The
judging was tight and consistent
throughout  there were no gifts.”

Other notable individual perfor-
mances included All-East Matt

Pitt downs Villanova, 85-62

they didn’t,” Massimino said.

“When we got ahead 6-0 I felt this
was a win,” Pitt's Smith said. “On
national TV, we were ready to really
bury them. I didn’t understand it
[The Pullback], but it gave us the
confidence we needed.”

“If you think about it, Chipman
did it before, in the St. John’s game
[Jan. l4],” said departing senior
Chip Watkins. “It shows a lot of
character.”

“That's shell shock," Chipman
said of the 87-56 ﬁnale. “It’s nice to
be sitting down at the other end."

Tournament this week or not,
Saturday’s loss moved Massimino
to hold a two-and-a-half—hour iilm/
practice session yesterday. The
Panthers held the Wildcats (18-9, 9-
7) to only 39 percent from the field
and Ed Pinckney to two points, both
free throws.

The same Pinckney who scores 16
points a game.

“The last couple of times we
played them they threw the ball to
the corners,” Chipman said. “Our
defense is good when the ball is com-
ing up court, but our back people
weren’t stepping up. We were flat.
But today, and especially against
Pinckney, we were coming up and
pressing.”

“We didn’t want them to get the
ball in the middle of the three-
second lane,” said another departing
senior, Andre Williams. “We

wanted them to shoot from the
perimeter. Another thing is we know
they leave their feet a lot. That
helped us get a lot of charges on
them."

In the 20 minutes he did play.
Dwayne McClain led Villanova with
l3 points.

Williams was the last of four
Panthers to hit double figures with
l0. Freshman guard Demetreus
Gore, who scored eight to give Pitt
its first I0-point lead (I6-6) 5:50 into
the game, finished with I3. Smith
had 18 and Shepherd 15.

‘‘He’s capable of doing that,"
Chipman said, referring to Gore.
“When he’s fresh he takes the shot
and gives you the little extra pene-
tration. But what I like is he’s play-
ing the best out in front of our
defense. It makes a difference in our
game. Nobody can look over him.”

Accomplishments have been
numerous for Chipman’s team this
season. The Panthers’ eight league
wins are two more than they’ve ever
had in one season and the 17th win
overall ties the ‘82 squad for the
most regular-season wins since 1974.
And there is serious courting of an
NCAA Tournament bid, a possible
first since 1982.

“Coach before the game usually
gives us things we have to work on to
win the game,” Joey David said on
Saturday. “This time he had to pass
out a ditto sheet, the list was so long.

We wanted to win it for the seniors, a
.500 record in the Big East, tlﬁ
NCAA 

“It’s a great feeling to get out and
accomplish those things and win.”

Rollie Massimino is waiting for
his chance.

Off the Boards: Gore, a 42.6 per-
cent shooter from the field, was only
six-of-l5 Saturday.

Junior Matt Miklasevich started
at center, but accumulated three
quick fouls 2:28 into the game and
was replaced by Williams one min-
ute later.  S

If Smith knew Pitt would win at
the 6-0 juncture of the game, then
the slow-motion move he put on 6-9
Pinckney to make it I0-4 sealed it.
With his back to Pinckney, the 6-10
Smith took a David feed, motioned
the ball to the left, drawing a
lowered Pinckney that way, and
gracefully lofted the ball from the
paint.

Charles Thompson, the third
senior who played his final game at
Fitzgerald, scored five points. Wat;
kins had two. 

After Providence (3-13) and
Seton Hall (I-I5) play Wednesday
night to open the Big East tourna-
ment, St. John’s (l5-I) plays that
game’s winner 7 p.m. Thursday. In
earlier games, Georgetown (14-2)
faces Connecticut (6-10) at l and
Syracuse (9-7) opposes Boston Col-
lege (7-9) at 3.

Where did these Panthers come from?’

By Joe Seman
The Pitt News

Could it be possible that the
Panthers blew out Villanova on Sat-
urday afternoon, handing the Wild-
cats their worst Big East defeat ever?
Better yet, were these the same
Panthers that fell to the Wildcats
previously by a score of 70-63? The
answer is yes and no.

The Panthers decimated the Wild-
cats on Saturday at the field house
85-62 in what can best be described
as a bloodbath. The Panthers of Sat-
urday resembled those of the earlier
loss to Villanova in name only.

A stunned Rollie Massimino cer-
tainly noticed the change. “You
gotta give Pitt a lot of credit,” stated
the Villanova coach, “they played a
heck of a game.”

In reality, it was more like half a
game, as Pitt went into the locker
room with a 17-point edge at the half
that Massimino’s starters were
unable to alter for the first three
minutes of the second stanza.

“I told the starters that I’ll give
them three minutes to show they’re
going to play in the second half,”
said Massimino, “and they didn’t."
With 17 minutes left to play and
trailing by 19 points, Massimino
gave up on his starters and rolled
over. The rest of the contest wasn’t
pretty, as the Panther bench showed
just how shallow Villanova’s talent
runs.

Why the change in the Panthers?
The most obvious factor in the earlv
going was Pitt’s defense. The Pan-
thers felt that if they could deny
Pinckney and Pressley inside, they
could dominate the game. Pinckney
scored only two points in the entire
game and finished the night 0-2 from
the floor with only three rebounds
for the night. Pressley fared little
better with only five points and three
rebounds for the evening.

“We didn’t do anything special,”
said junior Joey David. “We played
our regular 1-3-1 and 2-3. We,didn’t
key on Pinckney. Wejust worked on
keeping it tight inside.”

Despite this claim, there was a
very noticable difference in Pitt’s
defense underneath. Whereas the
Panthers have often had the prob-

lem of giving up the easy hoop
underneath,_ they had no trouble
denying the Wildcats the inside.

“I was collapsing on Pinckney
with [junior forward] Shep,” said
freshman Charles Smith. “We kept
them from getting the ball inside,
but as far as shutting down Pinck-
ney, that defense goes to Andre.” 

Senior Andre Williams had 
good night both offensively and de-
fensively, turning in 10 points and
snatching eight rebounds. “I tried to
keep the ball away from Pinckney,
but I didn’t do anything special,”
noted Williams.

An ecstatic Coach Chipman was
also happy with the defensive play,
expressing pleasure with the front
men (David and Gore) and explain-
ing the changes underneath. In the
past, teams had been able to pass the
ball to the corners, drawing the posts!
out. They would then swing the ball
out and Pitt would fail to step up
and front the low posts, giving up
the easy shot inside. There were no
such problems with the defense on
Saturday.

The Panthers hope to maintain
their new identity through the Big
East tournament and in the NCAAS.

The Panther wrestling squad

returned from the Eastern Wrestling,

League Championships having ﬁn-
ished sixth, ‘with a total of 30.5 team
points, while two individual Pitt
wrestlers qualified to compete in the
National Collegiate Athletic Associ-

V ation Championships (NCAAS),

— which will be held in two weeks.
The tournament started out at 118
lbs. In the first round, Pitt’s Joe
Iagnema lost to No. I seed John
Velimisis from Cleveland State by a
score of 23-13. After pinning his
opponent from Clarion State in the
second round, Iagnema finished
with a 1-2 record, losing to his Penn
State opponent in the third round.
With a tournament record of 3-1,
Panther John Hnath finished third
in the 126 lb. weight class, and with
his outstanding performance earned
himself a wild-card bid to nationals.
Hnath’s only loss was in the semifi-
nals when he was defeated by Rocky
Bonomo from Penn State, who ﬁn-
ished as the E.W.L. champ and is
currently ranked among the top five
in the country at 126 lbs. In the con-
solation finals, Hnath defeated West
Virginia’s Mike Levanduski 6-5.
At 134 lbs., undoubtedly the
toughest weight class of the tourna-
ment, Panther Kyle Nellis finished
with a disappointing 0-2 record.
Going into the weekend’s events,

' Nellis was seeded fourth but was

defeated by fifth-seed Dave Budnar
of Cleveland State ll-9 in his first
match. In consolations he met Paul
Clark, who defeated him in last
week’s dual meet and again in the
weekend’s tournament.

Gary Bolin, who was seeded No. I
going into the tournament, proved
worthy of his ranking — he finished
as the E.W.L. Champion at 142 lbs.
After receiving a bye in the first

Wrestlers pinned at EWL

round, he defeated Gary Caschak
from Penn State by a score of 7-4. In
the first period, Bolin was losing 4-0
but was able to turn the match
around in the second period. In the
third period Bolin reversed Caschak
with a nice move which earned him
five points. In ﬁnals, Bolin defeated
Tom Kramer of Lock Haven with a
score of 7-l.

“To win the E.W.L. Champion-
ships is a phenomenal feat,"
explained head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “It isn’t an easy accomplish-
ment and we’re very proud of his
performance — he deserved the
title.”

At 150 lbs., Greg Zimmerman fin-
ished 0-2 despite his tremendous
efforts. He was defeated by Blooms-
burg’s Mike Rudolph and Clarion’s
Byron Benner who finished third
and fourth, respectively.

After losing to West Virginia's
Thad Turner in the first round,
Doug Haines turned things around
to defeat Turner in the consolation
finals. His victory landed him a third
place at l58 lbs. During the tourna-
ment Haines also avenged a loss by
defeating Adam Cochran of Clar-
ion, who had defeated Haines in last
weekend’s dual meet.

“Because Doug was seeded fourth
going into the tournament, he had to
start out with a tougher bout than he
would have if he would have been
seeded higher,” explained Stottlem-
yer. “It’s unfortunate because I think
he could have done better if he
started out the tournament the way
he should have. It’s also disappoint-
ing that he didn’t receive a wild card
for his performance, but there’s
nothing we can do now,” added
Stottlemyer.

Sherm Moyer finished 0-2 as he
was defeated by Jody Karam of
Lock Haven and Clarion’s John Fla-
herty. Karam, who went on to
become an E.W.L. Champ,
recorded a technical fall over
Moyer, while Flaherty pinned him
in 5:35. In last weekend’s dual meet

Moyer upset Flaherty 10-9, but
unfortunately could not repeat the
feat.

Even after not being seeded at 177
lbs., Ken Hackman defeated No. 3
seed R.J. Costello from WVU in the
first round. At the end of regular
time, the two opponents were tied at
8-8, but it was Hackman who pulled
it out in overtime by a score of 4-3.
In semifinals Hackman got caught
and was pinned by Bloomsburg’s
Darrin Evans. In consolations, how-
ever, Hackman defeated Cleveland
State’s Kris Lowdermilk I4-6.
Hackman was defeated by No. 1
seed Greg Wycoff from Lock
Haven, which landed him fourth
place. He lost by a score of 2-0, hav-
ing lost both points through caution
penalty calls. ,

Curt Connor, wrestling at 190
lbs., ﬁnished 0-2 with losses to Penn
State’s Mike Seckler, 15-7, and to
Lock Haven’s Joe Pecaitis, 8-2.

It was Penn State that took the
team title, followed by Lock Haven
and Bloomsburg. Clarion finished
fourth, West Virginia fifth and
Cleveland State seventh.

“Penn State ran away with the
team title, but all the coaches could
be proud of their teams’ perfor-
mance,” said Stottlemyer. “We were
pleased with the team, especially
with Bolin and Hnath. And even
though for the rest of the guys there
really isn’t anything but next year to
look forward to, they will continue
to practice with these two guys, just
like they would come in if it were
someone else.

“The only negative thing about
Nationals for these two young men

is that it’s their first trip there," con-
tinued Stottlemyer. “But they’re
excited about the opportunity to
represent Pitt and themselves.

They’ve both been beaten during the
season, so they aren’t unbeatable,
but you can't count them out; it all
depends on who’s hungry and who’s
hot, not to mention being healthy
and having the official calling a good
match. It’s safe to say that they’ll

both be hungry, and for the rest,~

we’ll just have to wait and see.”

Women end season

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News J

The Pitt women's basketball team
had its season come to an end Friday
night in the form of a 56-55 loss to
Syracuse in the quarter-finals of the
Big East conference championships
at Manley Field House in Syracuse.
Syracuse used a balanced scoring
attack, along with some help off the
bench, to advance to the semi-finals.

Junior center Bonnie Baker, a

transfer from Maryland, came off‘

the bench and tossed in 10 points,
‘including two free throws in the
3waning seconds of the game that
iced the victory for the
Orangewomen.

Pitt got out of the gate fast as
Jennifer Bruce and Lisa Fubio con-
nected on consecutive jumpers to
give Pitt a 4-0 lead. It didn’t take
Syracuse long to recover, however.

Forward Toni Igrec, Pitt’s nemesis
earlier this season, scored seven of
Syracuse’s next nine points, and the
Orange extended their first lead to
15-8.

Before Syracuse could get out of
reach, Pitt coach Judy Saurer
ordered a timeout. Kim Gannis and
Stephanie Collins were inserted in
the lineup as Ellen Gilhooley and
Jenny Tyner exited, which gave Pitt
a smaller but quicker lineup, and the
move paid off.

A Collins 15-foot jumper, three
Bruce baskets and a Gannis jumper
put Pitt back in front 20-19, but now
it was time for Syracuse coach Barb
Jacobs to make a move. Jacobs went
to Baker, who was a starter earlier in
season but was benched for “her
lackadaisical play,” as Jacobs called
it.

Syracuse went on a 15-5 tear
where Baker scored six points,
grabbed three rebounds and blocked
a shot. Pitt went into the locker
room at the half trailing 34-24.

The first half was characteristic of
the entire season for the Lady
Panthers. Falling behind and having
to play catch-up ball in the second
half was their trademark this season.

Pitt’s dry spell late in the first half led
to the 10-point deficit and a‘ 35-
percent shooting percentage for the
first half, compared to Syracuse’s 50
percent.

with early loss at Big East

Unfortunately for Pitt, the second

half was also characteristic of the
entire season. Coming from behind
only to fall short in the second half
turned into a habit at times this sea-
son, the same holding true for
Syracuse.
' The Lady Panthers came out and
cut the lead to five by the 15-minute
mark. Bruce was everywhere, and
with the help of Syracuse’s poor shot
selection, the Lady Panthers drew
even with the Orange, 50-50, with
5:47 remaining in the game.

Pitt had its chances to pull away
from the Orange but could not get
the shots to fall. Gilhooley missed
two free throws, and the score
remained 50-50 at the 2:47 mark
after Igrec‘s fifth foul put her out of
the game and put Bruce on the line
for a one-and—one. Pitt’s All-
America candidate made the first
but missed the second, and instead
of a four-point lead, the Lady
Panthers only led by one, 51-50.
Enter Baker.

Baker replaced lgrec, Syracuse’s
top player, but Igrec wasn’t even
missed. Baker immediately got
fouled after she entered the game,
and she sank both free throws as
Syracuse took back the lead, 52-51.

Janice Long followed with a short
jumper in the lane, and Syracuse
extended its lead to three, 54-51, at
the 1:10 mark.

Pitt came right back as Collins hit
a jumper from deep in the corner,
54-53, Syracuse still leading.

After consecutive timeouts, Syra-
cuse finally got the ball inbounds,
and Ellen Gilhooley intentionally
fouled Baker with 11 seconds left on
the clock. Baker stepped to the line
and cooly sank both shots to ice the
game for the Orange. “I knew the
pressure was on,” said Baker. “1 saw
myself make the shots before I took
them, and I made them.”

Pitt went down and Bruce hit a
short jumper off the glass, but the
Panthers were still down by one, 56-
55, with four seconds on the clock.

The Lady Panthers used their ﬁnal
timeout, and Saurer gave some sim-
ple advice. “She just told us to deny
the ball the best we could, and if they
get it in to go for the steal,” said
freshman Sally Sheerer, who
entered the game when Gilhooley
picked up her fifth foul. “If we get a
clean steal, shoot it; if we foul, we
foul.”

Syracuse opted for a full-court

T

pass. Bruce intercepted and passed it
to Fubio, who hit Collins in the
corner. Her desperation attempt was
off and after the buzzer had
sounded, anyway.

For Syracuse, the eventual tour-
nament winner after they defeated
Villanova 57-56 in the final, it was a
good win. Jacobs was happy with
her team’s overall performance. “I
thought we lost our concentration
on defense for a little while in the,
second-half,” said the Syracus
coach, “but I was pretty pleased with
the way we played.”

Syracuse advances to the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.
For Pitt, two starters, Kim Tirik and
Jenny Tyner, return along with Kim
Gannis, Jane Plake and Sally
Sheerer, who all saw action off the
bench, to form a strong nucleus for
next season.

Tournament Notes: Bruce was
named unanimously to the all;
conference team but was shunned in
her bid to be named Big East Player
of the Year for the second time 
Villanova’s Shelly Pennefather got
the award  The game marked the
final appearance in a Pitt uniform
for Bruce, F ubio, Collins, Gilhooley
and Becky Maziarz.

WANTED: SGB

LUKE KLUCHKO
AGE: 21

YEAR: Senior .. '
MAJOR: Information Science

 

Ladies and gentlemen I
would nowlike to introduce the
1985 SGB President "Luke
Kluchko." "Student govern-
ment exists to ' promote the
concerns, interests, needs, and
welfare of the undergraduate
students of the University of
Pittsburgh.” This quote from
Luke's inaugural address,
which was taken from the SGB
constitution, is the foundation
of the many goals Luke is striv-
ing for in 1985. Luke feels one
way of achieving that goal is by
pulling the SGB together to
work as one team.

"It is our goal to fuse
together all of our organiza-

I tions to strengthen, grow, and
move as one body, as one
cause, with one direction, in
order to go beyond mere effi-
ciency to become more effec-
tive,” Kluchko said. With most
goals there are many road
blocks, but Luke is confident
that if the students talk to the
SGB members it will make
SGB goals for 1985 much eas-
ier to obtain. Luke also said," I
want to see the students faces,
hear their comments, to enable
student government to do its
job effectively.”

If you are a student and wish
to express a comment or idea
come to the meetings every
Wed. at 4:30 p.m. at the SGB
office in the Student Union. If
you don't wish to attend the
meeting you can call the SGB
office at X5920 and ask to
speak to Luke or an SGB
member.

  
 

AVERY ABRAMS .'
AGE: 20
MAJOR: Political Scienc
YEAR: Junior
‘GOAL: Avery, a two year Stu-
dent Government Board
Member, has been working on
the South African Project.

Avery has spoken to the
Board of Trustees and during

this meeting with the Trustees
he made his disvestiture prop-
osal. In this proposal Avery
suggests that the University
withdraw their investments
with corporations affiliated
with South Africa.

If you have a comment pro
or con about this heated issue,
please feel free to call the SGB
office and voice your opinion
with Avery.

LISA DOUDS
AGE: 20

YEAR: Junior '
MAJOR: Biochemistry

  

One of Lisa's goals this semester
is to make 24-hour visitation for
sorority members only to the
Amos Hall sorority suites. The pol-
icy now is that girls can only stay
over twice a week.

Lisa's most wanted goal of the
year is to regain SGB respect with
the students and administration.
Lisa feels that SGB is working for
the students and working with
administration to its best ability.
But to have an effective liaison
between the students and adminis-
tration the students must vocalize
their opinions to the SGB
members. One of the many rea-
sons that the SGB has lost some
creditability according to Lisa is
because, "the student body is apa-
thetic, students moan and groan
but they do not think to initiate
change. If the student body was
more active in Student Govern-
ment then its very possible that
the university as a whole could
improve.”

GREG CEDERLOF
AGE: 20

YEAR: Sophomore
MAJOR: Business/Psychology
Dual

 

Greg has two major posi-
tions that are directly involved
with the SGB. His is the busi-
ness manager that covers all
financial aspecélsl of the SGB.
Also, Greg is e liaison to a
new committee, The Fresh-
man Council, started last term
by SGB member Besty Fitz-
patrick.

Through the council he
hopes to have success in prom-
oting sirit, enthusiam in the

student body, and by seeing up
a program that will help to
enhance freshman orientation
this coming summer.

Greg is currently research-
ing the new state legislation
that deals with who will be
eligible for student loans.

PETE PETROPOULOS
AGE:2O

YEAR: Junior

MAJOR: CHEMISTRY

One of Pete's main goals is to
increase student awareness at the
University. "I don't want the stu-
dents too surprised at anything
that happens here at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. One way of
combating student ignorance at
Pitt according to Pete is "to have
strong committees with good peo-
ple on those committees will ena-
ble Student Government better
inform the student population."
Pete also feels that student apathy
in general is a great problem at Pitt
and he shares the same opinion as
many other of his fellow board
members, the students must
become more involved in Student
Government. "If the students do
not get more involved in then I
cannot achieve what I was elected
to achieve, serve the students to
the best of my ability.

it 3,’,

JIM MUMMA
AGE: 19
MAJOR: Political Science/English
Writing

YEAR: Sophomore

Jim's major goal for the '85 SGB
year is to do something that
directly involves the students and
maximizes this involvement and
awareness on-campus as well as
off. He is the chairman of the Stu-
dent Assembly whose members
include all the clubs and organiza-
tions at Pitt. Because the Study
Assembly is a direct link to the
SGB, Jim feels that this is an excel-
lent opportunity to do something
that affects a wide range of
students.

Jim is currently working on 2
projects within the SGB. He is try-
ing to help students financially by
organizing a discount card that
would not only be good in Oakland

 

ject is arranging to have a place
where used books can be sold and
bought at a fairer price than those
at the Campus book store.

KAREN FROST

AGE: 20

YEAR: Junior

MAJOR: Communications/Engish
Writing

Karen has been involved with
the Student Government since her
freshman year here at Pitt. She has
been a member of the following
committees: Emerging Leaders,
Student Relations Committee and
Academic Affairs, Academic Free-
dom and Ten—Year Senate Com-
mittee, and now the Student
Government Board.

Karen is currently meeting and
working with people to see what
can be done about the problem
with Teaching Assistants. She is
also proposing mandatory TA eva-
luations, but the most major part
of her proposal with the TA's is to
get the College of Arts and Scien-
ces to adopt a refund policy. If a
student has a significant problem
with a TA and is unsatisfied with
the TA then this student can with-
draw from the class and can
receive their money back.

Karen wasjalso a liaison for the
Inner Honorory Council and Aca-
demic Affairs but these two com-
mittees have since dissolved. But

now Karen wants to handle the
Student Course review that was to
be handled by Academic Affairs.
Also she wants to start working
with Dan Taylor on the problem
with the Student Health Fee.

DAN TAYLOR
AGE: 19

YEAR: Sophomore
MAJOR: English Lit./Political

Science

 

Dan feels that the important
issues are those which face Pitt
students on a daily basis. The
extended library hours issue
started last term is one prob-
lem he is currently working on.
As a member of the University
Senate Library Committee he
is in a position directly related
to the problem. Dan basically
wants to find out the needs of
the students and eventually
arrange for a twenty—four
hour stud lace.

._...___.__._.._..—_..._._.——.—....— __

Another problem Dan is
working on is the manadatory
student health fee. He feels
that a majority of the students
commute and do not need to
use the student health servi-
ces. Dan plans to find out the
percentage of students who
actually use the services and
hopes to make it optional for all
students.

Dan is also on the task force
working on the five year plan.
Future projects include getting
the students, University, and
City together to do something
about traffic light at major
walkways. Dan said, "the stu-
dent Government Board is
here for the problems of the
students and I encourage
anyone to stop by and discuss
their problems." He feels that
if the board works on the ever-
yday rigors the students face it
will make university life
better.

MICHAEL RYAN
~ AGE: 20

YEAR: Junior
MAJOR: Biochemistry

 

Mike is involved in a lot of
issues which directly face Pitt
students. He is currently
working on the problem we all
have with foreign TAs, and his

position on extended library J 5.

hours is that they should be |
during finals only. |

Mike feels the dormitory |
damage policy needs attention. |
He wants to make students |
aware of what is in their hous— |
ing contracts with the dual |
purpose of protecting their |
rights and making them more
cautious of themselves and
others.

His future plans are to work

on getting a delayed light at I

Fifth and Bigelow as well as
attacking the problem with the
bus lane. The alcohol policy
currently maintained by Pitt is
another of the problems Mike ,
wants to work on. He feels that |
a new policy can be worked out |
with the Office of Residence J
Life because the current policy |
is there, but it is obviously not |
working. j
Mike said, ”Student govern- |
ment has an open door policy; |
we are there to help and I invite I
students up to talk and to see I
that Student Government is 1
doing something to help Pitt 1
students." I

Pitt wins Big!

In the pool, on the court; a weekend to remember

Women
Win
Big East

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther swimming and
diving team got their toughest com-
petition from their own teammates
as they easily wrapped up their third
consecutive Big East Champion
ship. The team finished more than
300 points ahead of the No. 2 team,
Syracuse (937-586), and won 17 of
the 20 events.

“We have to scout out better com-
petition,” said head coach David
Belowich, who was named the
Championship’s most outstanding
coach. “It got to the point that we
were looking to break 1,000 points.”

Voted most outstanding swimmer
for the meet was senior Sue Heon.
Heon qualified for the NCAA
Championships which will be held at
the University of Alabama March
21-23. Heon qualiﬁed in the 500-
yard freestyle, 1,650-yard freestyle
and the 400-yard individual medley.

“Sue’s performing as she did at
her last home meet of her college
career was very inspirational for the
whole team,” said Belowich.

Heon broke her own record Sat-
urday night in the 1,650-yard free-

style as well as the Big East record,

finishing almost one minute ahead
of the second-place swimmer.

“Sue was so far ahead of anyone
that she had to motivate herself by
keeping track of how many laps she
was ahead of the No. 2 swimmer.
She wanted to win the race by two
laps,” Belowich said.

According to Heon, the 1,650
freestyle helped her accomplish one
of her goals — to gain confidence in
herself before she went to the
National Championship. “Seeing
my time at the end ofthe race [1613 I]

.really made me confident,” Heon

said. “I knew I couldn’t let up if I
wanted to make NCAA cuts. At the
100-yard point Dave [Belowich] sig-
naled me, and I wasn’t sure of what
he meant but he looked angry, so I
picked up the pace. I was really
pleased with my time.”

Along with Heon, the other
NCAA qualifiers for the Lady
Panthers include: Susan Hickman in
the 50-yard freestyle and as part of
the qualifying 200-yard freestyle
relay, Tracey Pﬁster, Alicia Dugan
and Cindy Rose .

Panthers
Stun
Wildcats

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Neither team really had a say in
the matter. And the Pitt basketball
team will never know whether free-
dom of choice would have extended
or abruptly halted a season.

Sometime just after 3 p.m. yester-
day, Georgetown smote Syracuse by
27 points, creating a fourth-place
logjam between the Orangemen and_
Villanova. Big East officials took it
upon themselves to assign Syracuse
tails and Villanova heads for the
coin ﬂip that decided who w.ould
play the Panthers next Thursday
night. The loser would have to play
an extra game.

Syracuse won the flip.

Pitt might already have lost the
game.

Jubilee had wafted through the
Panthers" locker room Saturday
afternoon after they’d handed the
Wildcats their biggest loss in confer-
ence play 85-62. Between the smiles
was talk of winning it for the seniors,
of pulling Pitt (17-10, 8-8) to its ﬁn-
est finish in the Big East, of Charles
Smith and Darryl Shepherd missing
only six shots from the field while
combining for 33 points ~ and of
hoping to play Syracuse in the first
round of tournament play three
nights forthright.

Everyone, including Coach Roy
Chipman, understands what bad
practice it is to face in the same week
— let alone in the same month — a
team wholly embarrassed before a
sellout crowd.

On Thursday at 9 p.m., Villanova
again faces Pitt in a first-round game
at Madison Square Garden.

“It’s always hard coming back to
play a team after beating them so
decisively,” Chipman said one day
following The Pullback. “Villanova
is a better team than they showed
Saturday but we’re playing so well
that I like our chances.”

Fitzgerald Field House partisans
saw only 23 minutes of “Villanova’s
team." Three minutes into the
second half, the score 48-29, Coach
Rollie Massimino yanked his entire
starting lineup and proceeded to lose
a basketball game.

“I told the starters that I'll give
them three minutes to show they’re
going to play in the second half. And
