Seminar focuses on job hunting

By Michael Ashford
Staff Wrlter

The cutthroat competition of the
business employee market often
seems impersonal and overly com-
petitive. But Miles Harrington, in a
lecture yesterday entitled “The
Unconventional Approach to Find-
ing a Job,” demonstrated where
humor, intimacy and creativity can
fit into the jobhunting process.

Harrington’s lecture preceded the
final event of Pitt’s Career Seminar
Series this week.

Harrington described his own use
of personal and self-conscious atti-
tudes while job hunting. “At an
‘interview with Salomon Brothers,”
he said, “they asked me,‘What moti-
vates you, Mr. Harrington?’ ‘Loy-
alty to the firm and my father's own
success,’ , I told him.” The firm
turned him down, saying they were
only interested in people who are
motivated by money. “I was glad not
to get the job,” Harrington said.

Group offers reward for paranormal

By lngrld Smith
Staff Writer

. The Paranormal Investigating
Committee of Pittsburgh
announced Wednesday that they are
now offering $10 thousand to
anyone who can prove he or she pos-
sesses paranormal powers.
According to committee chair-
man Richard Busch, the committee
is still skeptical of persons who claim
they possess extra-sensory percep-
tion or psychic energies, can bend
spoons, read minds, predict events
or do anything else out of the realm
of scientific explanation.
The Pittsburgh“ committee is a
local group with aims similar to
those of the national organization,

 

Harrington is on leavegfrom an
investment firm in Pittsburgh as he
pursues an MBA at Carnegie-
Mellon University. Despite his focus
on the small-ﬁrm investment indus-
try, Harrington contended that his
advice is valuable for those seeking a
job in any field today.

There are three essential phases to
his system: contacting the firm; get-
ting a resume out; and finally, get-
ting the interview. These three
phases are coordinated in what he
called the “shotgun” approach;

After deciding on your interests,
he explained, you must isolate your
potential employers and contact
them. With background informa-
tion on each employer in mind, you
should try to call them on the day
your resume arrives. By sending
your resume out on Monday, the
employer will most likely have it on
his desk by Wednesday.

This is where Harrington advised
that a person utilize all possible
means to find out the names of the
people who will be deciding if that

the Committee for the Scientiﬁc
Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal. The organization
attempts to encourage the critical
investigation of paranormal and
fringe-science claims from a respon-
sible, scientific point of view and to
disseminate factual information
about the results of such inquiries to
the scientific community and the
public "at large.

“We don’t have closed minds,”
said Busch. “We are not negative.
Maybe there is someone who does
have paranormal powers, but the
majority of people who come to see
us just think and actually believe
they do, while others are just plain
phony.”

The committee reported that one ’

woman who came to see them actu-

 

firm _or company is hiring. He sug-
gested directory assistance, library
listings and local business newspa-
pers and magazines as potential
sources. '

Showing his personal ﬂair, Har-
rington suggested tricking secretar-

, ies into divulging information over.

the phone. “Hello, this is Miles.
Could I speak to John in
personnel?”

“We have no John in personnel,”
she might say.

“Oh, well who is your personnel
director now?” you might reply.

Harrington caught himself at that
point. “Don’t get me wrong,” he
said. “Secretaries are great. So be
nice to them. But you've got to get
around them.”

If all goes according to the plan,
you may reach “the man” as he holds
your resume in his hands, Harring-
ton explained. “At that point one
must overcome the impersonal bar-
riers and try to control the conversa-
tion, thereby demonstrating your
ability to listen and your knowledge

ally thought she saw spirits in a por-
trait, and she believed that she could
grow hair‘ on her face and make it
disappear within a matter of min-
utes. The only problem with the
woman’s claim, they said, was that
she was the only one who saw the
hair on her face. “Actually, she was a
very self-confident woman,” said
Busch. “But she only saw what she
wanted to see.”

Also, others claim they can
remove curses. This presents a prob-
lem to the public, Busch said. What
is entertainment, and what is a rip-
off‘? People who claim to rid these
evil curses always seem to have some
type of trick, he added.

For example, Busch explained,
the person will claim he can get rid of .

   

of the business ﬁeld in which you are
interested. -

The interview itself, said Harring-
ton, must be‘ conducted in much the
same way. If it is formal and uncom-
fortable, the interviewer will want
you out as quickly as possible. Har-
rington again advised trying to guide
the interview, drawing the inter-
viewer to talk about his company by

bringing up particular issues. Of '

course, this is contingent upon ‘one’s
own efforts of pre-interview
research, Harrington said. -
Concerning the resume, Harring-
ton again explained the importance
of transgressing the conventional
norms. He urged those applying for
a job to creatively expand on the
standard “ADA” resume format.
The “attention” paragraph must
emphasize the person reading it.
“It’s got to be a you orientation,”
Harrington explained. “That means
mentioning the personnel director's
name, or, if the situation should

your worst fear if you write it down
on a piece of paper, toss it in a fire
and then walk through the ﬁre so
that the fear is trampled. Not only is
this illogical, he said, but the coals
used to make the fire are made of
ashes that don’t radiate much heat.
Therefore, there is no possibility of
burn, and to “remove” a fear this
way may cost hundreds of dollars.
“Over 100 people this year

claimed that they have some para-
normal abilities,” said Busch, “but
only 20 percent of these people actu-
ally follow up on their claim.” Out of
these 20, the committee hasn’t found
anyone whom they felt truly quali-
fied as someone with paranormal
abilities. “We don’t need to use the
scientific method, all we need to use
is common sense,” said Busch.

SGB—  
Election
process
begins

Byﬂllchael Ashford
Staff Writer

The 1985 Student Government»
,Board elections process for next

year’s members and president offi-
cially began Tuesday when petitions
for candidacy were made available
in the SGB office.

Thus far, six petitions have been ‘

given out, five for SGB member can-
didacy and one for SGB presidential
candidacy. Petitioners must obtain
100 signatures to run as member
candidates and 150 to run as presi-
dential candidates. The petitioning

process ends Oct. 14, at which time.

no new candidates will be

recognized. '
After three days into the petition-

ing process, only one woman has

begun petitioning. Mary Fratis,
- CA8 ‘88, said in a telephone inter-5 .- ‘
VICW that her “sole purpose for run-

ning for SGB is not merely as beinga

part of the liaison between students ” in

and administration, but represent-
ing the students themselves.” Fratis

had no comment on her being the ‘I

only female candidate.

SGB has traditionally been domi-

‘nated by white males, usually

members of a fraternity. However,

two women Lisa Douds and Karen-'

Leigh Frost, are now on the board.

The Black Action Society ‘is’ ,
endorsing sophomore Monique “ '

Sims as a candidate for a position on
the board. '

After candidates are selected by
the Election Committee on Oct. 14,
campaigning will officially begin on

Oct. 24. Candidates will then have at ’

chance to present themselves to the
student body at a “Meet the Candi-
dates” session on Oct. 30.

Last week, SGB approved new in

rules delimiting a recount procedure
should election results be contested.
These were enacted " largely in
response to Bob Kramer’s contest-
ing Luke l(luchko’s presidential vic-
tory last year.

A contesting of election results.‘

must now be made within three

working days of the election’s con’-’

clusion and only if there is a margi-
nal difference of two percent or less
in vote counts.

In addition, county voting
machines will be brought into the
Towers on Nov. 6-7. SGB President
Luke Kluchko said he hopes the
machines will improve Pitt's voter

turnout rates. Right now, though,‘

Pitt boasts a 35 percent student par-
ticipation rate in SGB elections,

compared to a national average of

25 percent.

The voting machines, approved
by the SGB last week, will cost only
$12 more than past costs of printing
and tallying paper ballots.

Soviet leader announces arms reduction proposal inParis

(PARIS) — Soviet leader Mikail
Gorbachev yesterday announced his
arms reduction proposal in Paris,

armaments in exchange for a total
ban on space-based weapons sys-

reduction of long-range weapons.”

Foreign policy analysts in the
United States and western Europe
meanwhile contend that the Soviet
Union has no intention of funda-
mentally changing its foreign policy

matic publicity is directed toward
putting blame on the United States if
the summit talks should fail to pro-
duce substantial agreement. Gorba-

siles_ targeted at western E_u_r_op_e.
Those missiles were deployed last
year to counter the installation of

ounce serving andsells for 99 cents.
It contains provolone and mozza-
rella cheese, ground beef, pepperoni
and pizza sauce in a pocket of
dough.

McDonald’s officials‘ say
“McPizza” is undergoing “opera-
tional testing” in 10 of its restaurants
in Philadelphia. Ofﬁcials want to see

' if the product can be made in restau-

rants that are geared primarily to
making hamburgers.

The “McPizza” is delivered frozen
to restaurants where it is deep fried.
It is served in a paper sleeve similar
to the one used for McDonald‘s hot
fried pies. If the “McPizza” survives
the Philadelphia test, the next step
toward nationwide production is 2
series of consumer tests.

SGB president reflects
on successes of board

By Jeffrey Carpenter
For The Pitt News

Student Government Board Pres- A

ident Luke Kluchko, looking back
at his time in office, said he has seen
much improvement in the opera-
tions of student government.

“We [set] some very good prece-
dents,” Kluchko said. “We isolated
our primary function, and that is
decision making. We came up with a
no-lose formula, which is to base our
decision on research and accurate
information rather than emotion.”

The Student Government Board
improved relations with the admin-
istration this year, underwent the
first major writing campaign to
Senators and Representatives con-
cerning financial aid, and for_ the
first time, presented a resolution to
the Board of Trustees concerning
South Africa, Kluchko said.

The S.G.B. was also influential in
gaining credit for ROTC courses in
the College of Arts and Sciences.
“We won the ROTC issue that was
considered lost [by some faculty
members],” he explained. “They
told us in advance, ‘There is no way
you’re going to win this one,’ but we
gave it everything we’ve got.”

Kluchko said that professional-

ism has returned to the Board, and

this has permitted the Board to be
more inﬂuential.

This year was the first year Stu-
dent Government has operated over
the summer. “[We set] a precedent,
and—I hope that someday it’s a pol-
icy,” said Kluchko. “There is a lot to
be done in the summer, and if you
don’t do it then, your fall is a waste
of time. We wouldn’t have been able
to do a lot of the nice things we did
those first weeks if it wasn’t for the
summer.”

In the future, Kluchko said he
thinks SGB should continue the
growing process. He_ also said the
‘Board should “continue with some-
thing that we started — the evalua-
tion process — from day one. That is
very helpful in outlining what your
direction is before the next term.”

Kluchko said the Board wanted to
build a very strong foundation and
establish a direction that would
carry over for many years to come.
“That’s why insisting on proper
decision-making, and evaluating
our structure is so important. The
better information we can present to
the administration, the faculty, or
who we want to influence, the
greater our chances of inﬂuencing
are going to be,” he said.

“I_ think we have set a lot of good
examples [this year], and we are
going to make it a little easier for the
next SGB," stated Kluchko. “I think
that’s what student government
boards have to do consistently every
year. [They must continue the] pur-
suit of improvement and constantly

evaluate and look for ways to
improve the way Student Govern-
ment operates.”‘ -

For the rest of the current Board’s
term, Kluchko said he feels they
should continue working until the
end. “I don’t want to get to the tradi-
tional lame duck period,” he said. “I
don’t want that ever to occur. If any-
thing arises, instead of saying ‘Wait
until next term,’ we’ll start now to
give [the next board] ‘something to
grow on. ~

“It’s the whole idea of giving it all
you’ve got until it’s over. That is
something I’ve greatly believed in
and I hope that the next group
comes in and realizes that one year is
a very short period of time. They
have to learn a lot and produce a lot
in a short period of time. That is the
essence of an effective student
government,” said Kluchko.

Kluchko said that, at points, the
job can be frustrating, but he quickly
adds, “I have sacrificed quite a bit,
but in return I have gained quite a bit
from those sacrifices. I have proba-
bly learned more in one year in this
job than I have in my entire college
career. And through all the frustra-
tion, through all the time I've spent,
there was never one second where I
was sorry that I was doing [this]. I’ve
always known even at the toughest
times that I loved what I was doing,

‘and that was my motivation.”

Kluchko said, “The only regret is
at ti_me_s when_a_n issue is brought up

~ us going. You still feel good inside.

Chaz PaIla/ The Pitt_News
and you do all you can to influence
and to make that issue a reality, like
the ROTC issue, and no one ever
really says ‘Thank you.’That may be
a small regret, but still there is
enough motivation up here to keep

Continuing to battle the problem
of apathy, and increasing the spirit
on campus are fnatters on which
Kluchko hopes the next board will
continue to work. “People always
say [apathy] is with us, but you have
to try [to reduce it] because you
learn a lot from trying and there are

some positive aspects even from our 

smallest projects. They’ve helped.
You just don’t want to give up. It
helps everyone in the long run,”said
Kluchko.

He added that he hopes “those
who are elected make a good effort
to try and represent everyone, and
keep that in mind. I hope that the
students who do run for the Board
are willing to work, and work very
hard. It’s not going to be easy."

Kluchko said his future plans
include working for a while, “proba-
bly combining the discipline of
Information Science and my interest
in Russian/ East European studies.
Eventually, I would like to work for
the State Department in diplomacy,
not so much in politics; I’ve never
really liked politics. I would like to
continue my education at graduate
school, but the State Department is
my eventual goal.” '

of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunisia.
Israeli officials claimed that this attack was motivated by
the Palestinian terrorist killing of three Israeli citizens in
Cyprus last week. But it has not yet been proved that the
P.L.O. ordered or was in any other way responsible for
the killings.

Much like a frenzied lynch mob, the Israelis set off on a
mission of -vengeance, scorning such formalities as first
gathering evidence and establishing guilt. The attack
resulted in the deaths of at least 60 people, approximately
20 of whom were Tunisians and in no way associated with

the P.L.O. One thing about those killed in the attacks is 

certain: The Tunisian casualties were innocent victims
and could hardly be held accountable -for the violence
against Israeli citizens.

The United States’ reaction to the air strike has been

sha-meful. While not condoning the attack, neither have

U.S. officials spoken out in condemnation of this vicious
act.

Does the Israeli attack not call for some stern response
from the United States? Can the United States in good
conscience continue to ally itself with and give support to
a nation which repeatedly undertakes immoral acts of
aggression (e.g., the air attacks on Beirut three years ago),
which threaten the United States’ vital interests in the
Middle East?

It’s time that U.S. decision-makers heed their conscien-
ces and stop allowing a very small but powerful lobby
group to dictate U.S. policy in the Middle East.

Trees Axed

Good Grief! Have you seen what
they’re doing to the trees all around
the Cathedral lawn? If “Arbor Day”
is the day we plant new trees, then
this is surely “Pearl Arbor Day,"
where we nuke every large, leafy,
peaceful gymnosperm in sight. Is it

the Port Authority cutting down the ,

trees to put in a new buslane, right
across the lawn this time? Is this a
part of Reagan's “constructive
engagement” with “killer trees?”
(They cause pollution you know.)
Or do we have some really. big
ground-hogs on campus?

The one theory that seems plausi-
ble to me is that Roger Benjamin
was put in charge of pruning man-
agement. I don’t know if this is true
or not, but I could just hear the con-
versation up in the Cathedral now:
“Now Roger, the trees are essentially
healthy, and they provide needed
shade and beauty, but we would like
to trim them just a bit." I could
imagine that they probably formed
the “Five Year Plan on University
Trees," and I can just hear Mr. Ben-
jamin giving the trees the bad news:
“The committee has found that the
Tree Department is low in central-
ity, and you'll all be in a going-down
situation very shortly (i.e. axed).”

Again, this is only a theory, and
not a real great one. Still, I would
give up a week’s beer money, even
take Organic Chemistry all’ over
again if I could be there to hear him
explain to the squirrels and the birds
where their homes went: “I‘m not
even going to answer that question.
You squirrels don’t even understand
the issue here."

Hunting

A long time hunter, I was much
dismayed by Bob Travers’ recent
castigation of the sport in his article
which appeared in the Sept. 30 edi-
tion of The Pitt News. Whereas Mr.
Travers has equated hunting with
"blowing Bambi‘s brains out," I
charge that unless Mr. Travers is
completely herbivorous in his die-
tary regimen, he is guilty of hypoc-
risy. How easy it is to buy a nicely
wrapped pork roast at the market
and never think that poor Porky Pig
was sacrificed for your sustenance.
Also, Mr. Travers, did you ever stop
to think that a Big Mac was once —
and some claim still is alive?

Now then, Mr. Travers, as to your
theory that hunters “have a streak of

NENS llEM‘ ‘ml-1 BUN; £llAlN REAioN ...
—————Letters to the Editor-——-—

masochism” and “tramp around in
waist-high snow, dressed in colors
that a clown would consider out-
rageous.” Regarding these points,
Mr. Travers, I would strongly urge
you to consider the proposition that
most sports-oriented regalia —- such
as, say, a football, baseball or
hockey uniform — do look quite
silly outside the particular sport in
question. And yes, Mr. Travers,
hunters, not unlike participants in
many other types-of sports, do sub-
ject themselves to somewhat adverse
conditions, but this merely adds to
the excitement and challenge that
are the allure of the hunt.

Hunting, as a regulated sport, Mr.
Travers, is a humane way of sparing
the Commonwealth’s deer herd
from suffering the ravages of slow
death by starvation during the win-
ter months when food is at a pre-
mium. Also, hunters do pay for the
privilege of hunting and the fees they
pay are used to finance wilderness
management projects which ulti-
mately benefit both man and beast.
However, Mr. Travers, I will re-
grettably concede to you that there
are those careless people among the
legion of hunters who do cause need-
less death and destruction, but they
are not true devotees of the sport. I
assure you, Mr. Travers, that the
vast majority of hunters are indeed
true sportsmen who are quite careful
with and concerned about the envi-
ronment —— yes, most hunters, and
fishermen, too are just as worried
about the effects of acid rain as you
are.

Council Critique

The flippant dismissal by the FAS
Graduate Council of my proposal
that the organization express its dis-
may with Pitt’s $37 million in indi-
rect investments in South Africa,
and lend moral support to the var-
ious anti-apartheid campus groups,
which are sponsoring a demonstra-
tion at the William Pitt Union on
Oct. ll, from 12-2 p.m., has com-
pelled me to expose the Council's
insensitivity, ignorance and racism.

According to one graduate repre-
sentative, blacks in South Africa are
economically better off than black
and white graduate students in the
United States. Given that the major-
ity of South Africa's blacks are
impoverished, without opportuni-
ties to acquire any degree of social
mobility, and forced to live in
racially segregated slums and “tribal
homelands." this assertion is bla-

tantly false and incredibly assinine.
Another representative stated
that South Africa was a legitimate
democratic nation, a valuable ally of
the United States. Rather than con-
demn South Africa, Americans
should be protesting against the
Soviet Union. What the Soviet
Union has to do with apartheid and
Pitt’s investments in South Africa I
was unable to ascertain. However,
there are at least two major logical
flaws to this particular representa-
tive’s argument. The first is that the
majority of South Africa’s popula-
tion, the blacks, are denied citizen-
ship and can neither vote nor hold
meaningful elective offices. Given
these facts, the current South Afri-
can white regime hardly qualifies as
a legitimate democratic govern-
ment. The second ﬂaw is if this red-
baiting representative believes that
there is an international communist
conspiracy, then does not Reagan’s
foreign policy and American invest-
ment in South Africa discredit
America’s image as a friend of lib-
erty and of the oppressed in the eyes
of our allies and the Third World?
America's and Pitt’s support of the
undemocratic, racist South African
regime supplies the “communist
conspirators” with devastating
propaganda which is used against
our nation in the court of world pub
lic opinion. 

Pitt students are implicated as
passive supporters of a racist, un-
democratic South African dictator-
ship. As the graduate History
representative to the FAS Graduate
Council, I urge all members of the
Pitt community to express abhor-
rence of the council's insensitivity
and ignorance and to protest against
university investment in South
Africa on October ll.

The Pitt News - October 4, 1985

For The Dissent/1,V,I_arkChfandlel’-~ 
Gender; Much Defined By. S

For close to a hundred years
moral development theorists have
sought to explain the fact that con-
ceptions of self, morality, conflict
and choice vary according to sex by
relying on arguments based on
human nature. Using male develop-
ment as their model, highly regarded
theorists like Freud, Piaget and
Kohlberg argue that women show
less of a sense of justice than men
and in other ways are morally
retarded. Carol Gilligan, “In A Dif-
ferent Voice” (1982), is refreshing
and provocative in her attempt to
construct an alternative paradigm.

Based on the work of Nancy Cho-
dorow, Gilligan argues that as a con-
sequence of the social division of
labor which assigns the role of pri-
mary caretaker of children to
women, the interpersonal dynamics
of gender formation are different for
boys and girls. Female identifv for-
mation occurs within the context of

Washington

WASHINGTON -— Years ago,
and maybe still to this day, there was
an institution called therent party.
This was a party held by people who
could not raise that month’s rent.

You came, you drank, y_ou partied .

and you contributed something
toward the rent. There was no dis-
grace. Into each life, a rent party can

- fall.

Lately, the rent-party mentality
seems to have gone national —- if not
international, First came the Live
Aid concert last July. -It raised
money for the starving in Africaand
in the process earned lots of entries
in the Guiness Book of World
Records: money raised, $58 million;

, acts performed, 36; total amount of

television time, 16 hours; estimated
television audience, 1.5 billion_Deo-

   

ongoing relationships. Girls learn
who they are by learning that they
are like their mothers. The process
of identification fuses with the expe-
rience of attachment. On the other
hand, boys, in defining themselves
masculine, separate themselves from
their mothers. Boys learn who they
are by learning that they are not like
their mothers.

Girls, therefore, Gilligan main-
tains, emerge with a basis of
empathy built into their primary
definition of self in a way that boys
do not. This strengthens their ability
to experience another’s needs. or
feelings as their own. Since differen-
tiation from the mother is essential
for the development of masculinity,
separation and individuation are

critically tied to male gender

indentification.

Gilligan finds that boys tend_to
resolve moral dilemmas by creating
a hierarchical ordering of values to

resolve conflicting rights and claims.
They abstract the moral problem
from its interpersonal context, find-
ing the logic of fairness in an objec-
tive way to decide who will win the
dispute. .

On the other hand, girls tend to
see the world as essentially com-
prised of networks or webs of rela-
tionships which must be sustained

and mediated through personal’

communication. Moral dilemmas
are construed as conflicting respon-
sibilities. They are resolved contex-
tually for women, unlike the
categorical approach of men.

In addition, when asked to write
stories corresponding to given pic-
tures, Gilligan discovered that men
are more apt to see danger in close
personal affiliations. The greater the

' proximity of the figures in the pic-

tures, the more men’s stories con-
tained aggressive elements. In
contrast, women tend to see danger

more often when social distancing is
the greatest. Women see danger in
situations of impersonal achieve-
ment and, competitive success.
Aggression for women is not so
much an impulse that must be con-
tained, as it is for men, but rather it is
a signal of a fractured relationship.

The images of hierarchy and net-
work which Gilligan finds in the fan-
tasies and thoughts of men and
women suggest different ways of
structuring relationships. As the top
of the hierarchy roughly corres-
ponds to the edge ofthe network, the
center of the network roughly cor-
responds to the middle ofthe hierar-
chy. Each image claims as safe what
the other defines as dangerous: for
men, the wish to be alone at the top
and the associated fear that others
will get too "close; for women. the
wish to be at the center of the net-

‘work and the associated fear of

ocial Experience  

being too far out on the edge.

Gilligan suggests that hierarchical '

relationships and institutions pre-
suppose not only the social division
of labor according to gender, but

also the domination of males. This is . 

consistent with the work of Richard

Leakey and Roger Lewin whi_ch_-
argues that gathering-hunting socie-

ties had neither hierarchies nor the
division of labor along gender lines
(which means that males did not
rule).

The politico-personal implica-
tions of Gilligan’s paradigm are

clear: abolition of the division of ‘

labor along gender lines and the end
of patriarchy. Specifically, this
means that men and women must
participate equally in the reproduc-
tion of social relations and the
socialization process, especially, but
in no ways limited to raising
children. ‘

Post Wrigrs Group/RiclicardCohen
Aid Insufficient; New Policies Needed I

ple or, it says here, 600 million more
than the previous record, the 1969
moon landing.

And then came the Farm Aid con-
cert organized by Willie Nelson.
This event raised an initial $3 mil-
lion, received pledges for $4 million
more and reported donations com-
ing in at the rate of $500 thousand an
hour. The purpose of this concert
was to help the American farmer.
The only problem is that neither
Nelson nor anyone else knows how
this is to be done.

That’s all right. No one knows
quite what to do about African fam-
ine, either. After some of the dying
have been saved and the sick nursed
back to health, the fact remains that
Ethiopia is a hellhole — a nation
split by a civil war, mismanaged by a

doctrinaire Marxist government
and plagued, as are other African
nations, with drought. No concert
can change any of that.

Of course, there's nothing wrong‘

with holding concerts to save lives.
Indeed, Bob Geldof, the organizer of
the Live Aid concert, and Willie Nel-
son, the spirit behind Farm Aid,
ought to be congratulated.

The trouble is that in their own
ways the two concerts have de-
politicized what are essentially polit-
ical problems. Sure, there may be a
farmer here and there who has tem-
porarily fallen upon hard times. For
him or her, a rent party would suf-

fice. But the farm problem is institu-

tional, the product of a particular

economic system and economic

decisions made by government. The

         
 

only thing that can solve it, if a solu-
tion is possible, is government itself.

The same is true, of course, of
African famine. To a degree, the
famine is induced by nature. But
drought is commonplace in Africa
and governments have the obliga-
tion to plan for it. When they pursue
wrongheaded agricultural policies.
when the theories of a 19th century
German intellectual take precedence
over the experience of centuries,
then Mother Nature is off the book.
At best, it is guilty of contributory
negligence.

The organizers of the Farm Aid
concert acknowledged that no mat-
ter how much money they raised, it
wouldn‘t alleviate the farm crisis.
What they did not acknowledge is

10 cut LARGE PIZZA  
& 2 LITER PEPSI

that they had fallen. victim to the
mentality of the times — an Andy
Hardyism that emanates. from the
White House and holds that govern-
ment is both powerless and incom-
petent. Voluntarism is the trick.

And it is nothing less than cruel to
suggest that the farm problem be
amenable to creeping Andy Hardy-
ism — that it can be taken apart into
component individual farmers and
that they, one by one, can be helped.

What would help them is a different
government policy or, barring that,
an admission from the government
that farmers, like steel workers, are
expendable. Either way, govern-
ment and its policies are the answer.

Harrisburg - The Three-Mile lsland nuclear reactor was turned on yesterday morning after a
federal" court reiused to retract a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NCR) go-ahead._ 

This will be the flrsltmtime the plant is used since a near meltdown crippled a second reactor in 1983.

The federal court was summoned after a citizens’ group appealed the NRC decision to restart the reactor. They contended the risks were still too great to restart the plant. Wednesday
night, 45 protestors tried to block the plant's main gate. Sixteen demonstrators were arrested by state police.

The “development” paragraph
should form some kind of transition
from your initial paragraph, Har-
rington advised. And the ﬁnal
“action” paragraph must be more
than “references available upon
request.” At this point in the resume,
said Harrington, you should tell the
reader when you will be in town for
an interview; naming a specific date
and a general time when you will be
contacting him. “4.0s are a dime a
dozen,” Harrington warned.
“You’ve got to show them some
other distinction, something
extraordinary.” .

Harrington related several anec-
dotes which he took from his own
experiences. For example, he
entered his experience as a vacuum-
cleaner salesman into the “other”
section of his resume, as well as the
fact that he had bicycled across the
country one summer with his sister.

“Did you really do that?” some-
one in the audience asked. ’

“That’s exactly what they asked
me when I called for an interview,”
Harrington retorted.

. Harrington also urged job appli-
cants to try to create jobs where
there aren’t any visibly available. He
suggested that applicants offer their
services at lower salaries with the
option that the company either fire
them or keep them on at a higher
salary after a certain amount of
time.

Moonshine —— A LIFE IN PUR-
SUIT OF WHITE LIQUOR

By Alec Wilkinson

Alfred A. Knopf

This is not the story of a reformed
drunk, or even that of an old codger
hiding from revenue agents. This is
the story of Garland Bunting, f’the
most successful revenue agent in the
history of a state that has always
been enormously productive of
moonshine.”

Wilkinson has not merely written a
researched biography, nor would one
expect the author who had pre-
viously written Midnights: A Year with
the Wellfleet Police to have done so. He
visited Garland, went on a few runs

of which are patched together with
brief chapters on the history and
technique of white-liquor making.
(White liquor is also known as rotgut,
tiger’s sweat, ’splo .and 29 other

names that Wilkinson lists in one ’

very long paragraph.) The history is
not so distant or irrelevant as one
might think. In 1794, the Whiskey
Rebellion, a protest against paying a
new tax levied on whiskey, lasted
four months in western Pennsylva-

nia, with the largest riot being held in
Pittsburgh. That tax was eventually
repealed, but the new one that Abra-
ham Lincoln signed a few years later
stuck. Part of the act included a provi-
sion for the Internal Revenue Service
to bring delinquent taxpayers ‘to the
government's notice.

Alec Wilkinson's history is good;
his descriptions are better. He doesn't
quite have the power of William Least
Heat Moon for describing and placing

hing, 

own-home

in a larger focus the people he meets,
but some details are very good. An
example: ”Since Garland owns more

' things than he is conveniently able to

store, a number of his possessions are
(in his backyard) permanently on

view." That sentence describes a '

lifestyle.

The largest part of the book is

made up of stories — not about Gar-
land but of him. Sometimes Wilkinson
just seems to be a recorder and trans-
criber. One whole chapter, in fact, is just
story after story, from “Vernon Sher-
ton” to “Hugh Pitts and His Brand New
Automobile” to “I Can Handle a One-
Legged Fellow Better than I Can a
Strong Man.”

Moonshine rides partly on the popu-
lar wave of nonfiction about down-
home country folks. Maybe
Americans are still yearning for those
roots. This books tells the story of yet
another of these quaintly bucolic
characters. What's wrong with that?

Showcase — Octobelr’.’4, 1985

 is crazy, funny, Silly, cute, boring......

By Lori Faiella

Maxie doesn't quite ”Hit on all

' sixes,” to coin a phrase from Maxie

Malone herself.

The movie, despite Glenn Close’s
dramatic double performance as
Maxie (a flashy, '20s showgirl) and
Jan (a very nice conservative lady of
the .’80s), isn't what one would con-
sider captivating or extremely mov-
ing. It has its moments, but it doesn't
have it.

The film begins when Jan and her _

husband Nick (Mandy Patinkin)
move ‘into an old apartment house
run by Mrs. Lavin (Ruth Gordon), a
wacky little old lady who converses
with the spirits on a regular basis.
Once in a while the couple takes on
the task of stripping layers of old
wallpaper from their living room.
Infatuated with the variety of prints

and paisleys, they discover a will on
the wall, written in red lipstick.

E" ”Maxie Malone lived here, Read it
and Weep," it reads. And with the
uncovering of the Will, the mystery
of Maxie Malone begins.

Nick, developing an obsession with
Maxie’s memory, discovers a copy of
her one film. With it appears the lady
herself, wearing an array of white
beads and ghostly white lace. Maxie,
totally amazed with her performance
— she died before its release —
decides to stick around to ”make it
big.” The catch — she needs Jan's
body to do it. From here the movie
gets crazy, with Maxie popping in and

out, determined to live her life — or

rather her second life —. to the fullest.

Maxie’s character is the strength of
the film. She is boisterous, blunt and
downright rude, but she's fun. Her
vocabulary, dominated by '20s slang

— phrases- like "pour me some‘
hootch” (meaning a stiff drink), and

”ease off, boss—lady” — demonstrates I

her very unladylike nature.

As Jan, Close is just as good. She
plays the hysterical, possessed
woman convincingly. Close demon-
strates her versatility as an actress‘,
changing characters as Maxie comes
and goes as she pleases, taking over
Jan, leaving her with hangovers and
headaches. ' .

Jan is the timid, shy type and so is

I her husband — until Maxie appears,

that is. Maxie has Nick so unraveled
he can't decide if sleeping with Maxie
would be cheating on his wife. After
all‘, it is his wife's body.

One thing about Maxie is that it's
silly. It definitely isn't the type of film
to be taken seriously. The "attempts to
cue in on human emotions are there,
but the results are vague. To an

extent, Maxie’s overpowering drive
to fulfill her dreams is moving. The

A idea of a ghost coming back to life ——

possessing another person, dancing
and singing — brings back memories
of Walt Disney.

Maxie, like a typical Disney film, is
cute and fun. However, it fails to
trigger the powerful emotions or
responses characteristic of a hit.
Instead, it leaves you feeling relaxed
or even a little bored. Though the
film has a few good scenes that will
make you laugh, the-y aren't enough
to keep you rolling. V

Overall, Maxie is average. The act-
ing and directing are good. Ruth Gor-
don is partcularly delightful, as usual.
The dog even earned a few chuckles.

Maxie is the‘ type of film that would
be appropriate for a lazy Sunday
afternoon or an HBO special, but for
the box office it's a little too mellow.

the Tony-winning Agnes of God first

for a mainstage play; but undeniably,
the story was told with great dignity,

ful and understanding, contributing
strength to every helping word —
void of ludicrous criticisms about reli-
gion and its place in society.

In order for Meg Tilly to play sister
Agnes, it was essential that purity

A and naivete be presented in a persua-

sive manner, in addition to making
Godseem like more than an imagi-
nary symbol of hope. Her perfor-

mance was so extraordinary that-

Bancroft and Fonda seem out of their

league. But if it were not for these A

ladies’ entrancing discussions over
Agnes, the film would have fallen
apart. Bancroft and Fonda both
respond U to" Agnesrwsituationl wgifh
solemn reasoning, and they also

 |||||||

enlighten the viewing experienceiby
exchanging past and current flaws of
their lives. When the cigarette-
addicted Dr. Livingston asks sister
Miriam if she has ever smoked, the
nun replies, ”Two packs a day —
unfiltered,” creating a humanity
within the stern Mother Superior -—_—
she never claimed she was perfect.
But despite their candor, both serious
and otherwise, it takes more diligence
as an actress to become Sister Agnes;
therefore, I feel that Tilly's role is to
be more closely watched for its unre-
lenting trustworthiness. After all,
how many actresses could convinc-
ingly say that they returned a gift of
God.

As for Sven Nykvist’s cinemato-

graphy, he always conveys a story’

with the mood that was written
within it, as previously seen in many
of I_n_gVmar Bergman's psychological
studieslfilms. You actually feel the
seclusion of the convent’s environ-
ment, while still viewing it through
an artistic_eye. His work not only
added cohesion to this film, but com-
plemented all-of the actresses and
supporting cast, as well as designers.
Agnes of God is a truly genuine example
of a contemporary melodrama at its
aesthetic best. ‘

Agnes of God is being shown to sold-
out houses at the Manor in Squirrel
Hill and the Showcase North.

A CAPELLA
Todd Rundgren
Warner Bros.

Not surprisingly, the only instru-
ment on A Capella is Todd Rundgren’s
voice. Here, he combines his

reknowned technical genius with a
startling gift for mimicry to produce
instrumental sounds ranging from
the drum to the kazoo and vocal style
ranging from Islamic chants to bar-
bershop quartets.

”Neat sound effects and exotic
wailing from a popular studio wiz —
so what?” you might exclaim upon
hearing such a concept. But if you
know A and appreciate any of
Rundgren’s voluminous work, you'd
remember that the guy has too much
integrity to indulge in showy'gim-
micks. The songs on this album are
riveting and often exuberant, and
while Rundgren provides you with
the curious pleasure of trying to fig-
ure out what instruments he sounds
like, after a while you forget any spe-
cific vocal tricks and enjoy the songs
on A Capella in their entirety.

The first song, ”Blue Orpheus,” is
centered around the same chugging,
oral percussion that the Fat Boys use
for a beat. Rundgren hums like a syn-

thesizer. More Rundgren vocals com- .

Si

bine to sound like a choir, and against
this cacophony, Rundgren sings ‘a
high, jazzy melody that contracts
intriguingly with the train-like
rhythm backing him up.

”Hodja,” on the other hand, is a
jubilant cross between gospel and
doo-wop. The strange thing about
this one is that its subject is Middle-
Eastern ecstasy. Teach me how to spin like
I see you do/ Why don't you make me the envy
of the kids in school/ I know what to wear/ I
know how to sound,.I know how to kiss the
ground are the incongruent lyrics.

Coupled with the Islamic mysti-

cism of ”Hodja” and ”Miracle in the

Bazaar” are some harmonic Celtic
ballads. One, ”]ohhny lingo,” suffers
from Rundgren’s fake Irish accent,

-but ”Honest Work,” which has no

instrumental noises — just plain
singing — is a stirring folk song about
unskilled labor.

”Something to Fall Back On” is a
knockout example of pop-soul that
should be a hit single. Although the
song is classic Rundgren, he sounds a
little like Daryl Hall on it, and perhaps
this will be enough to fool pro-
grammers into giving it airplay.

One unpleasant note on the album
is ”Lockjaw,” a darkly amusing ditty
about a monster who nails shut the
mouths of lying children. Here,
Rundgren adopts the voice of a
cranky old storyteller, and while this
is pretty funny, there's something
queasily overwhelming about the
song. Maybe there are too many con-
flicting sounds, and Rundgren’s
warm, highvoice sounds shrill.

The best pieces on A Capella are the
simpler tunes ' which feature
Rundgren’s singing rather than his
ability to sound like a Moog Fairlight.
For instance, he does a joyous remake
of ”Mighty Love" and — all by him-
self — manages to sound like five

Spinners. ,

Crenshaw comes of i

age ”Downtown”

DOWNTOWN
Marshall Crenshaw
Warner Bros.

Marshall Crenshaw won critical
acclaim and loyal fans when his first,
self-titled album debuted in 1982.
Meshing classic '50s and '60s rock
sounds, Crenshaw played succinct
pop songs dominated by ringing gui-
tars and his emotion-filled voice. The
formula worked again on 1983's Field
Day. And again Crenshaw’s band,
featuring his brother Robert on
drums .and.Chris Donato on bass, laid
a tight rhythmic base for his pieces.
. -Downtown, the long-anticipated
third album by Crenshaw, presents
changes in his typical format. With
guest musicians backing Crenshaw
and T-Bone Burnett producing, the
record is filled with fresh, varied

‘instrumental and. vocal sounds.

Crenshaw’s lyrical talents have
expanded, too; his songs are wonder-
fully detailed in their vision. Downtown
effectively showcases Crenshaw’s
musical growth over the last two
years. I

Enlisting guest players works to
Crenshaw’s advantage. The drum
work ranges from the thin, sibilant
sound on ”Like A Vague .Memory” to
the bold smacks forging gun-blast
backbeats in ”Little Wild One (No. 5)"
and ”The Distance Between,” among
others. Hall and Oates drummer
Mickey Curry plays with the most
obvious flash. Also, Crenshaw’s gui-

‘ tar sounds have a rawer edge than

before on many tracks, and the leads

THE DREAM ACADEMY

The Dream Academy
Warner Bros. -

Here is another band attempting to
wed two disparate elements,
classically.-trained musicians and
popular music. For London's two-
year-old trio, the Dream Academy,
the union is amicable although unre-
markable. Produced by Pink Floyd's

David Gilmour, the album is replete.

with classical instrumentation,
including timpani, oboe, and a char
anglais (?). This serves as a backdrop
for Nick Laird-Clowes’ acoustic gui-
tar and wispy lead vocals and Gilbert
Gabriel’s lush, textural keyboards. The
combination works best on the songs
“The Edge of Forever,” with its up-
tempo, timpani—backed chorus and
Kate St. John’s eloquently aggressive
sax-playing, and “Bound to Be,” led by
its frenetic bass line and Adam Peter’s
(of Echo and the Bunnymen) cello.

”Yvonne” really smoke. He also tones A

down, adding. acoustic guitar on ”Les-
son Number One.” Uncharacteristic
instruments for a Marshall Cren-
shaw album — bongos, keyboard and

even electric sitar —' also ‘enliven the ' '

record. ,

Crenshaw’s vocals have never
sounded better than on Downtown.
The fun he has singing Ben Vaughn’s
”I’m Sorry (But So Is Brenda Lee)”
and the BradfordILewis composition
”Right, Now” comes out audibly.

Crenshaw’s own backing vocals add- I

richness to ”Blues Is King” as he
smoothly delivers the lead vocal. His
voice -is consistently engaging
throughout the album.

With more diversity in the sounds
on Downtown, some_songs stand out
more than others. ”Blues Is King,”
performed with Let's Active

members Mitch Easter and vFaye.
' Hunter, probably best demonstrates

Crenshaw’s musical strengths. ”Lit-
tle Wild On; (No. 5),”, with its lonely-
sounding verses exploding into
hopeful choruses, is another winner,
as is the sizzling rocker ”Right Now."
But, though these cuts are especially
good, the album shines throughout.
By challenging himself to experi-
ment with new musical ideas, and
through his maturation as a tune-
smith, Marshall Crenshaw makes
Downtown his finest work to date.

sionallv to the detriment of the
songs. “The Party” begins with unneces-
sary “party” sound effects. In “Life in a
Northern Town,” the lyrical referral to
the Beatles cues background applause
which only clutters the song. Also, the
backing string section frequently domi-
nates the sound, ‘making some songs
sound like over-blown elevator music.

 

Nick Laird-Clowes’ vocals have all
the impact or throwing a potato chip
into the wind and the lyrics keep pace
with the delivery, covering such dar-
ing and forbidden topics as falling in
love, loneliness, and falling out of
love.

The Dream Academy adequately
blends their classical training’ with a
pop accessibility, creating a palatable
and listenable debut album. The mix-
ture, however, never catches fire. It
dreamily drifts ondown the middle of
the road. If you enjoy competent
musicianship and pretty production,-
the Dream Academy offers it. If you
are looking for something beyond

that, dream on. I » :2

EAST TO WEST
Peelabeelia
Qwest Records

East To West marks the American

‘debut of British band Feelabeelia.

Recording for Quincy Jones’ Qwest
label, this trio works hard to adopt
the sounds of black American per-

 formers. But the band's black influ-

ence sounds limited, and their
attempts to be soulful or inspirational
are weak. Feelabeelia also dabbles in
straightforward dance music and
lush, keyboard-dominated songs on
East To West. With this confused sense

of musical direction, the album ends
. up a disposable collection of

synthpop.

Feelabeelia enlisted producers
Brock Walsh and Glen Ballard to
work on the album. Noted for their
work with artists such as Melissa

~ Manchester and the Pointer Sisters,
' Walsh and Ballard provide a clean,

open atmosphere for the musicians.

‘ . The quality of the instrumental work

within that atmosphere, however,
varies considerably.

Andy Povall’s keyboards sound dif-
ferent on almost every‘ song. With
them, Povall successfully creates a

Showcase — October 4, ‘I985

rich, textured backdrop for the

enchanting "In The Middle Of The ’

Night.” He also works his playing in
well with Nick Murphy's propulsive
drumming on ”I Want To Know
Why.” But most of the time his role is
reduced to filling up_ the mix or play-

ing annoyingly repetitive runs. This.

use of Povall’s playing proves unfor-
tunate, leaving songs sounding like
bland '70s disco instead of lively,
credible dance music.

   

Mark Price's singing doesn't aid the
cause, either. At his worst, he sounds
like a gravelly Stevie Wonder barking
out words. This is most apparent on
’’Feel It,” the band's first single,
which, incidentally, includes some
intense harmonica work by Stevie
Wonder himself. Price shows some
capability, singing less harshly on "In
The Middle Of The Night,” and he
sings some great vocal lines at the
close of the "Oxygen,” but these

heir Own

moments represent exceptions to his
normally grating voice.

The lyrics with which Price works
have a vague poetic feeling that can
be alternately intriguing and frus-
trating. The format works well with
the band's romantic songs, while
songs with broader topics are either
obscure in their message or trite.

The sound of the record has other
good and bad points. Additional
musicians Joel Peskin and Jeremy
Pitchford contribute some stunning,
albeit brief, sax work. Staccato horns
spruce up the mellow ”Love Me The
Same,” and Brock Walsh makes a fine
backing vocal appearance on ”I Want
To Know Why.” Most of the backing
vocals on East To West sound out of
place, however. Especially silly are
the gospel-flavored choruses of
"C’mon — meet your maker" backing

_ the slow, dull ”Oxygen.” Also out of

place is the raunchy guitar solo in the
otherwise clear, sparse ”Life In A
Dream.”

Feelabeelia seems to draw on its
musical influences‘ indiscriminately.
Because of this, East To West becomes a
hodgepodge of lightweight, unexcit—
ing songs. This is a band in desperate
need of a sound they can call their
own.

Showcase — October 4, 1985

LONE IUSTICE
Graffiti
Oct. 2, 1985

American music is alive and well, as

Lone Justice proved to an apprecia- —

tive throng Wednesday night at
Graffiti. In a short but thundering set
of straight-ahead rock ’n’ roll with a
solid backbone of Opry, the L.A.

group demonstrated why critics on

amboth coasts are calling them the best

R’.

new band of 1985.

Maria McKee, the group's 21-year-
old vocalist, crooned in the tradition
of Nashville greats like Patsy Cline
and Emmylou Harris, and many of
Lone Justice's songs confirmed a rev-
erence for country music (true coun-
try, _ not, that is, ‘today's slick,
mediocre country-pop); but when the
band turned up and rocked, which
was . frequently, McKee’s delivery
turned aggressive and matched the
blasting guitars beat for beat.

Lone Justice's love of American
rock shone through in a blistering
cover of Creedence Clearwater Revi-
val’s ”Fortunate Son,” (McKee had
the good sense not to substitute the
word ”daughter” for ”son.”)

Other highlights of the stormy 55-'
minute set included ”Ways to be

‘Wicked/’ a Tom Petty song that was
originally intended for Damn the Torpe-

does, and the group's current single,
”Sweet Sweet Baby.”

Most impressive of all was a cover
of Lou Reed's classic ”Sweet ]ane,”an
encore, which slipped briefly into a
few bars of ."Walk On the Wild Side”
before roaring back into the final
chorus.

Complaints that the set was too

‘short proved, if nothing else, that
Lone Justice is a band from which
people want to hear more.

Opening the evening was Pitts-
burgh’s VISA, a tight, smart band
that have good instincts and fine
stage presence. Fronted by three
burly guys who have to be brothers,
VISA brings to mind a new musical
category: ”Mafia Rock.” (Nah,
scratch that.) There were tight har-
monies, good ensemble playing, an__cl a
strong lead singer of the Frank Sina-
tral Tony Bennett school. In a town
where cynical rock fans like to boo
local acts off the stage, VISA
impressed the crowd, as well as your
reporter.

(Note: This review was written
after the singles column, in which a.
VISA song is reviewed, but myjudg-
ment on that particular tune still
stands.)

I've been receiving a consid-
erable volume of mail com-
menting on this column. Most
of it, happily, has been favora-
ble and supportive, but some of
it has been decidedly negative.
”Obnoxious,” ”pointless,”
”pretentious” and ”useless” are
among the kinder adjectives
that have been used. One letter
in particular, from a woman in
Shotgun, Mont., saddens me:
Dear Sirs,
I have been a’ faithful
subscriber to The Pitt News
for over 70 years, but I
have never in my life been
so appalled by anything as

that you have deemed fit

obnoxious, pointless, pre-

REALLY WORTH WAITING FOR?

We know that there are some
larger pizza operations that can
deliver a pizza faster than Trattoria.
That may be because a lot of the
other chains are more concerned
with the quality of the delivery than
the quality of the pizza.

BUT

Quality and great taste is worth
waiting for. We won’t take short cuts
in the preparation of your pizza.
From the first step of making our
dough and mixing our thick rich
tomatoe sauce to the last step of
removing excess steam and mois-
ture by allowing the pizza to sit for a
few minutes after baking to prevent
a soggy tasteless pizza.

Ah, well. You can't please
everyone.

The Alarm: Majority
It's been a long time since the last

‘release from The Alarm, and I'm

sorry to say that it hasn't been worth
the wait. Here is more ”angry young
man” hollering, a little stirring,
maybe, but it's gotten pretty tired.
”Majority" reveals
taking from Big Country records, but
it winds up sounding like a lukewarm
Stiff Little Fingers. After all this time,
The Alarm’s anger is beginning to
sound just a bit contrived. Hell, even
The Clash stopped yelling when they
realized everyone had their fingers in
their ears. C-plus

The Hooters: And We Danced

”All You Zombies,” an MTV smash
last summer, got. my vote for Most
Annoying Schlock Hit of the Year.
What's everyone raving about? The
Hooters are a bland, uninspired
bunch of post-Who rockers, all false
urgency and self-important lyrics.
Theyhave all the trappings of a "new
music" band, but there is nothing
new about them. The times have
changed,_that’s all. Ten years ago this
band would have been Cheap Trick.

Husker Du: Makes No Sense At All

This band's career has been
nothing less than remarkable. Mov-
ing from undistinguished hardcore
punk to sudden, breathtaking diver-.
sity (Zen Arcade) and then to unex-
pected pop accessibility (New Day
Rising), Husker Du has displayed a
ferocious reluctance to be pigeon-
holed. ”Makes No Sense At AIl"is the
latest in a series of furious, roaring,
yet melodic singles.

If you haven't heard Husker Du,
their sound could be described as
”existentialist thrash.” Bob Mould’s
voice is a little scary, but with Grant
Hart's chiming back-up vocals and
the band's typically simple, true lyrics
(I don 't know why you want to tell me/ When
I'm right or when I'm wrong/ It's the same -
thing in your mind/ The only time I'm right
is when I play along/, Walking around with
your head in the cl6’uds/ It makes no sense at
all), the song works on many levels,
with a melody strong and appealing
enough to snare even the most timid

— listener, but with a passion and inten-

sity that should please the most jaded.

Husker Du has a new album out
that is rumored tobe brilliant. I'm not
one to spread rumors, but when
you're talking about Husker Du, any-

thing is possible. A

most adventurous, innovative, yet
deeply-rooted-in—tradition reggae
band around is not only British but
predominantly white. With the help
of lead Pretender Chrissie Hynde,
UB40 transforms Sonny Bono’s pop
chestnut into a bouncy Caribbean
romp with a delightfully syncopated
variation of the chorus. This is mod-
ern reggae at its most effortless and
joyful — UB40 just keeps getting bet-
ter and better. They're limited, sure,
but they're always interesting.

VISA: Nothing But A Lie

Yeah, VISA's a local band, and I
should be nice, but they play this song
on the radio so.it's fair game. I have
not seen VISA live, so Icannot pass
final judgment, nor can I condemn
their entire body of music. But this
song is a drag. It's a limp synthe-
ballad with pedestrian soul—searching
and self-pity. Worse, the singer is a
Bowie imitator, something for which
Ilhave no patience. I am bored with
Bowie imitators even more than lam

”Weird Science”   has
weird soundtrack

WEIRD SCIENCE SOUNDTRACK
Various Artists 1
MCA

Motion picture soundtrack albums
have come to represent instant big
sales for record companies. The

soundtracks Footloose and Vision Quest I

spawned numerous hit singles. Usu-
ally soundtracks become little more
than collections of unrelated, inof-
fensive pop. (A model of incoherence
is the ”Vision Quest” soundtrack
which features artists as diametric as
Madonna and The Style Council.)
The soundtrack from ”Weird
Science” almost breaks that mold by
featuring a number of progressive
new music bands. But occasional slips
into, bland, aimed-for-AM music
keeps the record from being a com-
plete success. -

Oingo Boingo’s bouncy title song
kicks off the album, while punchy
horns and cracking drums drive this
bubbly rocker. The song's lyrics add
wonderfully to the unabashed silli-
ness of the tune. Side one’s next two
songs, however, fail dismally.
Cheyne’s "Private Joy" is monoto-
nous, uninspired disco. ”The Circle,”
performed by Max Carl, hints at new
wave with Carl's unique voice, but
the music proves weightless power
pop. Kim Wilde revives the record
with ”Turn It On.” Jimmy Iovine’s
production gives the track a full, rich
sound, and swelling synthesizers
compliment Wilde's dynamic singing.
Wall Of Voodoo closes the side with
”Deep In The Jungle," which sounds“
fine, but without the quirky fun of
Stanard Ridgeway’s vocals, Wall Of
Voodoo lacks energy and originality.

Two laughable hard rock tracks
open the soundtrack’s second side.
The Broken Homes waste an inter-

 

esting twangy guitar sound by giving
way to distorted power chords and
standard metal vocals‘ on ”Do Not
Disturb (Knock, Knock);” ”Forever”
by Taxxi could qualify as the worst
lost-summer-romance ‘song ever,
immortalizing lines like, ”You went
your way and I went minel And the
memories will last for a long, long
time." A cute observational lyric

makes Wild Men Of Wonga’s ”Why .

Don't Pretty Girls (Look At Me)” list-
enable, and vocalist’s transition from

- the low, Billy Idol—esque singing on

the verse to his raw, throaty scream
on the chorus comes off well.
Thumping drums, nasty sounding
guitar riffs and intense singing blend
on ”Method To My Madness,” by The
Lords Of The New Church, and turn
the song into one of this album's
standouts. Equally compelling is Kill-
ing ]oke's "Eighties/’ Roaring guitar

. surfaces all through this seething

condemnation of life during the pres-
ent decade. ”Weird Romance,” a ser-
ies of ”Oohs” and ”Ahs” sung above a
dull synthesizer track, ends the
album. This senseless, wordless bit
by Ira and The Geeks has no place on
this record.

The ”Weird Science” soundtrack
spotlights some very good new music
bands. The album could have been
consistently good, but its makers
bowed to commerciality and included
unoriginal tracks with intended hit-
radio appeal. Had the ”Weird Science”
soundtrack included less fluff and
more exciting, progressive bands, it
could have been one of the most cred-
ible movie-linked records to date. As
it stands, the album represents a
potentially great compilation made
inconsistent by "its conservative
concession.

Going for baroque

By David Zuchowsky .

On Saturday, Oct. 5, Pittsburgh's
only professional baroque ensemble,
Music's Recreation, will team up with
Catherine Turocy at the’ Morris
Kaufmann Auditorium, 315 S. Belle-
field Ave., in Oakland (across from
Heinz Chapel) at 8:30_ p.m. The con-
cert is titled ”Les Characteres de la
Dance” and will feature T_urocy danc-
ing in authentic 18th century choreog-
raphy, cost.umes and masks.

Turocy has performed exhaustive
research to recreate the baroque
dance, the forerunner of ballet. Com-
pared to ballet, Turocy states,

I ”Baroque dance is a much more natu-

ral way of moving and far more dra-
matic because of its rhythmic

' complexities. It is also more demand-

ing on the dancer.”

Turocy is the artistic director and
soloist of the New York Baroque
Dance Company. She has lectured at
the Royal Academy of Dance in Lon-
don and the National School in Stock-
holm, and she has been invited to
speak at the Sorbonne in Paris. Col-
laborating with John Eliot Gardiner
in Europe and Concert Royal in the
United States, she has performed in
Paris, New York, Toronto, Mexico
and the Spoleto Festival.

”Norma” comes back to

By David Zuchowsky

Tito Capobianco, general director
of the Pittsburgh Opera, opens the
_47th opera season with Bellini’s lyric
masterpiece, ”Norma,” only the
second time to be staged here in Pitts-
burgh. Norma is one of the most fa-
mous bel canto operas, a tragedy of
passionate love and a romanticized
version of the Greek drama ”Medea.”

The title role, sung by British
soprano Rosalind Plowright,
demands exceptional vocal skill and
stamina, a _largewr_a_nge of dramatic

"Music's Recreation moved to Pitts-
burgh from the Netherlands, where
they were founded in 1979. In July,
Music's Recreation recorded their
first album of music from the French
Baroque for Meridian Records in
London. The record will be released
on disc and tape and should be availa-
ble in the near future.

The ensemble specializes on
baroque music performed on period
instruments such as viola da gamba,
baroque violin and baroque flute. The
group spent the summer in Europe, a
trip that included their first visit to
Poland, where they performed in the
Festival of Old . Music and the
National Gallery in Krakow.

Music's Recreation toured the Brit-
ish Isles (for the fifth time) and per-
formed at the York Early Music
Festival. They also played a series_of
concerts for the National Trust in
17th and 18th century mansions near
Cambridge as well as in Birmingham
Cathedral.

The concert will include music by
Lully/D’Anglebert, Handel, Rebel
and Rameau. Tickets are $10 ($7 for
students) and may be purchased at
the TIX booth in Oliver Plaza or at
the door. For further information call

Ricky says

By G.B. Patterson

”Baggy" anything. The bigger the
better. Have you noticed the prolifer-
ation of triple X shirts around? And
then there's the huge, Ricky Ricardo-
sized pants that everyone’s wearing.

Well, the good old USA, which is
usually a season or two behind in
fashion, has set a trend that the rest
of the world has readily accepted.
American clothes have always been a
little loose and not as finely tailored
as, say, Italian clothes, but they are
American as apple pie! I think that the
”baggy” look probably started when
teenage girls started to wear their
fathers’ old suit jackets.

More recently, ”baggy” is asso-
ciated with giant t-shirts that say
”Relax" and ”Choose Life” in 15-inch
letters. Big, loose pants are quite
comfortable, too, and they look great
on anybody. That brings up an
important point: Anyone looks good in
baggy clothes. They can hide bad
points and accentuate the good ones.

—- ”Baggy

The trend is toward big fun
clothes. This can be seen in the
designs of Esprit clothing, Calvin
Klein's menswear and Guess? jeans.
All have full cuts and are easy to
wear.

SO  go out and get yourself some
Big clothes. They're fun and they're
fun to wear. I hear that even Wes
wears some oversized grey flannels
every now and then. And remember,
it all started here in the United States.
Oh sure, the French have Guess? and
Girbaud, but we have Calvins and
5015.

"Bogi

Dave Hhoker/ The Pitt News

 

heavily amplified and exuberant
sounds of such blues legends as
Muddy Waters, Lightning Hopkins,
W. Elmore James and John Lee
Hooker. Only Hooker is still alive,
but their music became the founda-
tion of contemporary popular music.
Make no mistake, when Muddy
Waters declared that ”the blues had a
baby and they named it rock ’n roll,"
he couldn't have been more accurate.

And it's many of the more over-

blown trappings of today's ”radio ‘A

rock” that continually lead fans back
to the blues. Blues is a folk art form
unconcernedwith adolescent sexual
posturing, pretentious thematic
ponderings and the unsteady fickle-
ness of the public. This music attacks
at full throttle the inherited pains and
adversity of human existence, and
after a grueling boogie battle, con-
vincingly declares the triumph of the '
irrepressible human spirit.

So children beware! John Lee
Hooker, aka‘. ’’The Hook" a.k.a.
”The Boogie Man,” is an entertainer
not to be listened to lightly, with his
possessed guitar‘ playing, stompin’
left foot and primeval moans. His

music, as one writer noted, ‘"lies _

somewhere between a dream and a
nightmare.” _

And so it went last Thursday night
at Graffiti. Joined by the_Coast—to-
Coast Blues Band, that revolving Bay
Area unit he has toured with for the
past 15 years, "The Hook" performed
a furious ‘set of stirring boogie and

V blues."-‘Not your typical blues band,

this outfit "operates with neither a
pianist nor ‘a "blues harpist,,. but‘
instead with a formidable four-
pronged guitar onslaught.

After several preliminary instru-
mentals featuring Roy Rogers on

 

amplified acoustic guitar, highlighted _

by his stinging tone often on the
brink of manic feedback, the 67-year-
old Hooker crept on stage. At first
appearing physically fragile, crouch-
ing over a microphone while seated
with his guitar, his resonating and
economical moanlyell had no diffi-
culty whatsoever cutting through
the dense and pulsating sonic jungle
surrounding him. He followed up this
initial funky mayhem with a slow and
brooding triple-beat blues that
emphasized his mesmerizing vocal
intonation with its unforgettable
modal chant—like delivery. Unlike
anything ever heard, this voice resur-
rects long-forgotten spirits from
deep in the history of the famed Mis-
sissippi Delta. V -

However, the peak moment of the
show was the frenzied boogie rave-

up that constructed the greater part .

of the set. The now—standing "Boogie
Man” was in fearful form as he
stalked the stage. Following the
example of Hooker’s forceful and
unrefined guitar assault, lead guitar-
ists Michael Osbornegand Roy Rogers
riffed relentlessly, and together with
the percolating rhythm tandem of
bassist John Mazzocco and drummer
Tim Richar, hurled theimpenetrable
mass of whirling spectators into
transcendant boogie bliss. .

So be forewarned: ”The Boogie A

Man” rampages still. Whether you

experience his riveting rhythm "and" ‘
fblues‘ on any of his more than 100
-‘ albums or witness him live onstage,

prepare,.yourself for some spine-

“ tingling ‘and maybe even illuminating A !

American folk art. "

Take heart America : We do have culture

many others on many occasions.
Soon, however, I realized that
these assertions embraced a false pre-

that such statements were predicated
onlcultural arrogance. No, that would
be too simple. Rather, they were
tragically grounded in convention

Pitt games officiating to be
reviewed by Eastern supervisor

By Michael Bertonaschl I
Staff Writer

“I'm very upset with the officiat-
ing ,today and you can put _that in
print." —- Foge Fazio after the West
Virginia game

As Pitt prepares to meet the South
Carolina Gamecocks on Saturday
afternoon, head coach F oge Fazio is
preparing to show some home
movies tonight. At Fazio’s request,
Art Hyland, who is the head of offi-
cials for the I0 eastern teams in the
Independent Football Association,
will visit the Pitt offices.

Hyland will review game films of
the Panthers’ first four games. Spe-
cial attention will be focused on the
31-30 loss to Boston College at
home, and the l0-l0 tie at West Vir-
ginia. Fazio is upset that no calls
were made when Boston College
quarterback Jim Karsatosthrew the
ball out ofbounds a number oftimes

to avoid a Panther rush. A close
look at the ﬁlms shows that the near-
est receiver was a hot dog vendor.
Fazio was also concerned with the
number of holding calls against his
offensive line in that game, all of
which came at crucial times. _

Against West Virginia, Fazio
singled out a face mask call against
Walter Johnson with 14:20 to go in
the third quarter. The Mountaineers

“had a third down and nine when
Johnson sacked quarterback Tony
Reda for a 5-yard loss. However,
Johnson was called for grabbing the
face mask, which made it first and

-10. Six plays later, West Virginia
kicked a 32-yard field goal.

With 11:31 to go in the game and
Pitt clinging to a 10-3 lead, the
Panthers had a third down and one
at their own 14-yard line when it
appeared that West Virginia
jumped offsides. Instead, Pitt was
called for‘ illegal procedure. A.B.
Brown could pick up only five yards
on third down and six and the ensu-
ing punt gave West Virginia the ball
at midfield. The Mountaineers took

the advantage offered them and
drove for the tying points on a con-
troversial touchdown.

“I don’t‘want to make a ‘big issue
out of it and I don’t want to make it
sound like we’re making excuses,”
said Fazio. “I don’t want our players
to be distracted by it. I just want
them to go out and play football. All
we want is clarification on a few
things."

The outcome of those games can-
not be changed. What, then, does
Hyland feel will be the result of his
reviewing the game films? ‘‘I would
not choose to discuss my comments
that I make to a coach about the
officiating to anybody," he said.

Although the five calls mentioned
will be reviewed and discussed, the
major concern to Fazio-is to get a
clariﬁcation of the holding calls that
the Panthers have been flagged for.
With the type of ball control ground
game that Pitt has employed this
season, mistakes by the offense have
been their undoing. Holding calls
have stalled many promising drives.
Offensive line coach Joe Moore has

built a reputation for producing
excellent, well-schooled, offensive
linemen. Throughout the years they,
have rarely had problems with
excessive holding penalties. Why
then is it such a problem all of ‘a
sudden? __ ,

‘‘They’ve liberalized the use of the
hands by the -offensive linemen,”
said Fazio. “You had to keep your
hands inside before and now you
have to just keep them in the frame-
work of the body. If we’re teaching
the wrong techniques then I want to
know about it, but I know we aren’t.
We just want clarification on it.”

“It [the liberalized rule] has been
coming for the last three years,” said
Hyland. “Before you had to block
with your hands cupped and not
fully extended. Now the hands can
be open and you can’ push within the

framework of the body. You still .

can’t grab a shirt or hook a player's
arms when you're blocking.“

It is said that an official can call a
holding penalty onjust about every
play. According to Hyland, the

Fazio ﬁne tunes his squa

By Jim (lrban
Sports Editor

It may be a different Pitt Panther
football team that takes the field
this weekend against South
Carolina. For the past four
weeks, Pitt’s defense and offense
have taken turns putting forth

‘banner performances. It seems
_ like both units were alternating

weeks in playing good football. -
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio is
confident that his ‘Panthers are
ready to put it all together.

“I think we’re pretty good,”
explained Fazio following yes-
terday afternoon’s practice ses-
sion at Pitt Stadium. “I know
one thing. Everbody’s ‘talking
about how it's a big game for
(South Carolina). It’s a big game
for us too!” '-

A big game indeed. A win
against South Carolina could
serve as a springboard for the
rest of the season. No one knows
that better than Fazio. He has
made some changes that may
fine tune a’ defense that put forth
its best effort of the year last
week against West Virginia.
Fazio plans to start senior Brian
Shields opposite Steve Apke at
linebacker. He will be the third
linebacker to start at that posi-
tion this year, succeeding junior
Lee Hetrick and sophomore

.Matt LaVigna.

“I think the big thing we are
looking for is someone to be
more vocal," explained Fazio
about the linebacking switch.

“You got to be able to holler out ‘ I

what the formation is, direct
your line if you're stunting, know
when to stunt, and know when to
come out of it.” Fazio added,
“The linebacker, a lot of times,
his job is more of a quarterback
and a leader, barking out
changes in the coverage. We’re
not getting that.”

Going into’ the season, Fazio
faced the challenge of replacing
Troy Benson and Caesar Aidi-
sert at the linebacker _po_sitions.
Apke, a junior, has picked up the '
slack in tackling, leading the
team with 56 tackles, but the
leadership of the defense has
been missing.

“One of our problems that
we’ve had is you can’t be a quiet
guy being a linebacker,” said
Fazio. “You have to be a yacker.
You have to be an introverted
guy that's‘ yacking all the time-
Those are some of the things you
have to take charge of.” Fazio
noted, “That was hurting both
Matt (LaVigna) and Lee
(Hetrick), although Lee has
started to come back. Those are
some of the reasons we have had
some -breakdowns on defense.
We are not getting that com-
munication that we need.”

Communication is one thing,
among others, that the Panthers
will need in order to stop the
South Carolina offense. The
Gamecocks have speed to burn

 Panthers

get ﬁfth win

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

The Pitt women‘s tennis team
upped their record to 5-4 last night
with a 7-2 victory at Washington
and Jefferson. The Lady Panthers,
behind strong singles play, got off to
an early lead, and never looked
back. ,

‘‘It was a good confidence
builder,” said head coach George
Dieffenbach, “to win like that!”

The Lady Panthers rebounded
from a loss in the opening singles
match when W & J's Susan Hor-
nacek defeated Pitt’s Julie Gress, 6-
2, 6-0. Pitt won the final five singles
matches and had the match clinched
before doubles play even began.
Sophomore Stephanie Nelson
handled Suzette Hanley 6-3, 6-3,
then Pitt’s Carrie DeVera downed
Katie Bell 6-3, 6-2.

Senior -Kris Peckman added .to
Pitt’s 2-1 lead with a 6-4, 6-3 decision
over Elizabeth Davis. Peckman is
one of only two seniors with Gress
who dot Dieffenbach’s roster.

The Lady Panthers got strong
play out of their bottom two singles
players, Karen Meade and Bridgit
Kyle, to clinch the win. Meade won a
three-set marathon over Karen
Bush, 5-7, 6-2, 6-3, then Kyle iced

the victory with another three-set ,

victory. Kyle put W & J ’s Marialana

DiMaggio away 7-6, 2-6, 7-5. Dief-
fenbach was elated.

“I would say the best performan-
ces under pressure came from the
bottom two singles players, Karen
Meade and Bridgit Kyle,” said Dief-
fenbach. “They both won three-set
matches that clinched the victory
before doubles even began. Had
they not won those matches, it could
have gone the other way."

The Lady Panthers went into the
doubles matches knowing they won
the match, and emerged with two
out of three. W & J ‘s Hornacek and
Hanley outlasted Pitt’s Nelson and
DeVera in the first doubles match
6-4, 3-6, 7-6. The Lady Panthers
took the final two matches. Peck-
man and Meade defeated Davis and
Bell 6-4, 6-7, 6-4, and Kyle and Gress

dumped Bush and DiMaggio 6-1, V

6-3. .,

A win like this was just what the
doctor ordered for Dieffenbach’s
crew. “It gave the team some confi-
dence,” noted Dieffenbach.

The Lady Panthers have three
matches next week. They are on the
road against St. Vincent and
Slippery Rock early in the week,
then return home to host West Lib-
erty on Friday afternoon at 3:30 at
Trees courts. -

The Lady Panthers must win their
last four matches in order to equal
last year's victory total of nine.

Coming off a three win weekend,
the Lady Panthers volleyball team is
in fairly good shape. They are l6-3,
relatively injury free and leading the
Big East title race. This weekend
sl1oulgl_t_esttl_1c Pa_nth_ers playing cal-
iber. Tomorrow at l p.m., the Lady
Panthers travel to State College to
take on arch rival Penn State. This
could be the dictating factor of the
season. If the Panthers win, a great
deal of confidence stands to be
gained. If they lose, well 

The Pitt-PSU game should pro-
vide some tight action. Besides being
a nationally ranked team, Penn
State tradition goes back a long way.

These factors could be advanta-

geous for the Lady Panthers though,
as the combination of the two
should have the team psyched and
ready to “unseat” the Nittany Lions.
Freshman Nora Mulvihill claimed,
“I’m definitely psyched for this
game.” ‘

The Georgetown Hoyas will play
host to Pitt Sunday afternoon.
Although not traditionally one of

the stronger teams in the Big East, '

Georgetown has done a lot of .

improving this season. They picked
up several good recruits and are
starting to rebuild the program. If
there is to be an upset, the Hoyas are
just the team to .dovit. With players
like Nora Mulvihill, Sue Hoover
and crew, the Lady Panthers are

hoping to extend their win streak to

12 games.

Miller Time



By Randy Miller C

Panthers next seven games might earn them a bowl bid

Call me an eternal optimist if you
will,—but Pitt will win their seven
remaining football games this
season.

Withithe likes of South Carolina
and North Carolina State coming to
town the next two Saturdays, fol-
lowed by trips to Rutgers and Navy,
Pitt is going to roll. The team will
then come home to beat Syracuse,
win at Temple, then_defeat Penn
State.

This will make Pitt ll-0, right?
“No, the Panthers are 1-2-1,” you
say. Wait a minute. I have attended
all four Panther games this season
and have yet to see them beaten.

A few “if’s” here and there and
Pitt would be presently undefeated.
If kicker Mark Brasco had made the
two chip-shot field goals he attemp-
ted at Ohio State, Pitt would have

defeated the U.P.I.‘s third ranked
team. If Pitt safety Troy Washing-
ton could have tackled Boston Col-
lege receiver Kelvin Martin on the 30
yard line when presented the chance
on that crucial 4th-and-one play,
Pitt would have beaten the Eagles.

And Pitt did win in West Virginia
last Saturday. I know they did. The

rowdy Mountaineer fans were com-

pletely silent after the game. A -10-10
tie, you say. But Pitt earned the vic-
tory. They shutdown West Virginia
almost the entire game. If Pitt would
have converted just one of two field,
goal tries, the victory would have
been secured.

The point is, a play here or there
and Pitt is once again a top 20 foot-
ball team. The Panthers would be
4-0 with the winner of the Pitt-Penn
State game going to the Sugar Bowl.

Maybe I'm dreaming, but don't give
up all bowl game hopes yet. With the
toughest part of the schedule out of
the way, Pitt is ready to show the
country it does indeed have talent.
The Panthers‘ running game is
among the nation’s finest with Char-
les Gladman, Brian Davis and
Anthony Brown running at will past
would-be defenders. Gladman has
rushed for over 100 yards in each of
the three games he’s played. Davis
has averaged 89 yards in two games
while Brown gained 106 in his first
start. All three should be healthy for
tomorrow’s clash with South Carol-
ina, and that can only be bad news

for the 2-2 Gamecocks. Pitt’s power--

ful running game should be enough
to stop South Carolina, who lost 22
seniors from last year’s 10-2 Gator
_Bowl team.

Pat Viancourt

Brasco is out

Viancourt kicks

Pitt head coach Foge Fazio
announced earlier in the week that
the place-kicking chores have been
handed over to‘ junior Pat Vian-

court. Viancourt replaces sopho- f

more Mark Brasco who has been
troubled all season, making only
three of seven attempts.

Viancourt, a native of Parma,
Ohio, has been handling all the kick-
offs for the past two years. He burst
onto the scene as a walk-on two
years ago when he booted a 43-yard
game-winning field goal against Syr-

acuse in the waning seconds of the
game.

Brasco was a highly touted kicker
from Jeannette, but since coming to
Pitt, has had problems with incon-

' sistency. In 1984, Brasco hit only six

of 14 field goal attempts. This year

the problems continued. Brasco '.

missed two field goals against both
Ohio State and West Virginia. In
both games, the final score could
have been affected by the field goals.

Viancourt, in his career, has made
one of two field goal attempts, and
missed the only extra point attempt.

However, if the running game
isn’t enough, Coach Foge Fazio has
a new plan of attack for the passing
game. Fazio said to watch for the
Panthers to start throwing for post
patterns, a missing chapter in the
team's offense.

“The opponents defensive backs
have been playing too deep,” said
Fazio. “They were worried about us
throwing deep to Chuck Scales for a
quick six. We’ve been working hard
to get a few long ones into our
offense. We’ll probably throw a few
long passes this week.”

Thus far, Pitt’s longest pass play
was 37 yards to Matt Stennett. How-
ever, with teams having to pay so
much attention to the run, Pitt's
passing game is bound to improve.

With Fazio naming Pat Viancourt
as the team's placekicker for the

South Carolina game, hopefully the
kicking game will improve. Brasco
has an outstanding leg and isn't to be
given up on yet, but he hasn’t proved

he can come through in the clutch. ‘

Viancourt, on the other hand, has
already proven his worth. The junior
left-footer was put into a pressure
situation the first time he ever took
the field as a Panther, back in 1983.
Viancourt. calmly booted a 43 yard
ﬁeld goal to lift Pitt to a memorable
13-10 win over Syracuse.

Pitt has the ingredients of a win-
ning football team. It must now start
producing victories. The Panthers’
share of tough luck ended last week
in Morgantown. Tomorrow the
momentum will change.

Soon, Pitt again will be the Beast
of the East.‘

“Without penalties and turn-
overs, we could have_put even
more points on the board. We
have to go out this week _and
work at what we did wrong
against Georgia.” Sharpe admit-
ted, “We have confidence, now,

in our short passing game. We
were effective against Georgia in
that _depart.merit."

Running back Anthony Smith
echoed those comments. “We
proved against Georgia that we
can play as one unit offensively,”
said Smith confidently. “Pitt has
a good defensive ballclub. But, I
feel if we give 100 percent, we've
got the confidence to go up to
Pitt and get after them.”

Pitt has managed to decrease
their defensive problems as the

may minimize the problems even
further with Shields at
linebacker.

“When you have the line-
backers and free safeties talking
and talking,” noted Fazio, get-
ting back to the subject of com-
munication, “that eliminates a
lot of your problems."

Communication may be the
missing ingredient in Fazio’s
recipe for a bowl game, and a
victory over South Carolina will
be the icing on the cake.

Asl see it  

National pastime turns into obsession

“It was all I lived for, to play ball. "
—- Mickey Mantle

It began as a game, an emotional
deliverance. It was in_tended to be
passive indulgence for all ages. It has
far surpassed its original motives. It
has become a source of rapture for
the most fervent of disciples. These
people suffer a passionate obsession
for this game. They truly live for it.
Almost every action of the day is tied
to it in some fashion. It is the most
unshakable addiction once it
attacks. But the victims feel no
remorse.

“I’d walk through hell in a gaso-
line suit to keep playing baseball."

— Pete Rose

These people experience a unique
existence. '1 heir religious devotion
to this seemingly innocent game has
left them at a level of insanity
unmatched by any of the more con-
troversial cults that have taken hold
over those searching frantically for
the very secret of life. But these, the

‘followers of this game, feel that they
have found the one true answer.
They are convinced that the universe
rotates around the actions that take

place on a diamond-shaped field. To
them, this is the highest of art forms.‘
To them, this is the consumation of
man. To them, this is life itself.

“Baseball is simply a dramati-
zation of the lifestruggle of a man. ”

— Walter Johnson
This magnificent, majestic specta-
cle could have easily been played
within the Roman Coliseum. Such is
the royal nature of this athletic
encounter. But instead, it was born
on American soil. It has been played
in beautiful, green, country fields,’
and in dirty, dusty sandlots. It mat-
ters not where it is played because it
supplies its own breathtaking
beauty. It eliminates the problems of
the day, and sustains in its partici-
pants the breath of life.

"Within the ballpark, time moves
differently, marked by no clock
except the events of the game. 
Since baseball, time. is measured
only in outs, all you have to do is
succeed utterly: Keep hitting, keep
the rally alive, and you have
defeated time. You remain forever
young.”

— Roger Angell

One cannot condemn the follow-
ers for seeking perpetual youth. It is
a pursuit that most would attempt if
they thought it plausible. America
gave birth to this quest in the 1840s.
It has since become the foundation

of American culture. Most of those
foreign to our land fail to under-
stand the dire necessity for the exis-
tence of this athletic engagement.

“Whoever wants to know the
heart and mind of America had bet-
ter learn baseball.

— Jacques Barzun

It is a general acceptance that
soon after birth, a child is whisked
away to one of these fields of en-
deavor and taught the implications
of being an American citizen. They
must engage in this bizarre activity,
for it has all of the raw essentials
necessary for an earthly existence.
They are also taught to follow the
ongoing saga of the masters of this
trade.

"Baseball is continuous, like
nothing else among American
things, an endless game of repeated
summers, joining the long-genera-
tions of all the fathers and all\the
sons."

— Donald Hall

This game is‘ fancied to be the
secret to being a fine citizen. It pulls
would-be delinquents off the streets
and redirects their lives in a more
reputable direction. It has preserved
the souls of many. If someone

- imports scandal into this the greatest

of all spectacles, he is deemed the
most lascivious of all criminals. But
this is the exception to the rule. This
game is predominately a savior to
the young.

"There is nothing better calcu-
lated than baseball to give a growing
boy self-poise and self-reliance. ”

—- Albert Spaulding S

It has brought forth many Ameri-
cans from the depths of destitution.
It has rescued many youths whose
lives were trapped in an intricate
maze from which there seemed no
escape, and given them a means of
redemption. It has also aided its
adherents in temporary flight from
the drudges of day-to—day living. In
this the land of opportunity, it pro-
vides an opportunity for a peerless
thrill. While many expel vacuous
words of loyalty, this exhibition has
proved to be unimpeachably
American.

“Baseball has done more to move
America in the right direction than
all the professional patriots with
their billions of cheap words. "

— Monte Irvin

By Jim Brueckner

It has been depicted as the “oasis
in the desert.” There has been no
greater understatement. It has been
the jewel of the American public for
generations. Its followers divide the
people of the world based on their
perception of this game. One can
attain a no more eminent status than
that of an experiencer of this cele-
brated and blessed event.

"I believe that all men who have

   October 4, 1985

lived and achieved success in this ’

world had lived in vain if they knew
not baseball. ”

—— Senator Chauncey Depew

It is said that those who exist with-
out this devotion live in a bleak and
dismal world. But those who are
able to feel its emanating warmth are
the chosen ones. It is a fortune of
boundless wealth. There is, how-
ever, no greater fortune than the
priceless memories of past warriors
of the diamond. These men are
heroes of a mythical nature. They‘
are strangers to us all, yet we accept
them as brothers.

"He was a parade all by himself a
burst of dazzle and jingle. Santa
Claus drinking his whiskey straight
and groaning with a bellyache
caused by gluttony  Babe Ruth
made the music that his joyous years
danced to in a continuous party.
What Babe Ruth is comes down, one
generation handing it to the next, as
a national heirloom.”

— Jimmy Cannon

The heroes are an integral part of
our nature. We rejoice in their tri-
umph, suffer in their pain. In 1939,
one of these heroes was found to be
dying of amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis at a young age. Despite his being
robbed of half his life, he felt himself
blessed because of his interaction
with this wondrous game. As a dying
man cried out to the masses, the
emotional renumerations of this
game were never more evident. The
brave warrior stood tall.

' "Fans, for the past two weeks you
have been reading about what a bad
break I got. Yet today I consider
myself the luckiest man on the face
of the earth.”

— Lou Gehrig‘

Lou Gehrig and anyone else who
has ever been connected with base-
ball, knows the sweet joys that can
come from the game. It is truly a gift
to us all. .

Thank God the Pirates are
staying.
