dent workers received instructions
in the University’s part of the
city’s YVelfar‘e Fund drive this yeai',
which is to continue throughout this
week.

in helping to realize the goal set for

president of VVSG-A, spoke to those
gathered at the luncheon on the im-
portance of such a.n undertaking and
the satisfaction that may be derived
by each student participating.

This year there has been no quota
set by the VVelfare Fund of the city
for the University. Last year, stu-
dents gave a total of $2,000 as their

Players Show “Enter Madame” at IKS

By Sam Honigberg

Director Carl B. Cass rang up the
curta.in on the Pitt Players’ 1932 sea-
son when he presented his ambitious
group of thespians in “Enter Ma-
dame” at the Irene Kaufmann Settle-
ment Auditorium Sunday night, a
sparkling comedy of Gilda Varesi
and Dolly Byrne that enjoyed a. most
successful season on Broadway back
in 1920.

It was a courageous undertaking, to
be sure, since the full interpretation
of the play’s brisk and witty dialogue
calls for professional actors. The re-
sult, as shown before Sunday night’s
jaudience, was rather pleasing. Betty
Quarrie, enacting the part of Madame
Lisa Della Robbia, a world-famous
donna, a spoiled, potted,
stormy lady, was convincing and amus-
ing. Under the able direction of Mr.
Cass, Miss Quarrie was as tempera-_
mental» and as whinitsica1'-as-»the- pant
calls for her to be. Clarence Sober, in

 

iBctty Quarric Effective as Prima Donna
In Scason’s First Production

l

;t.he next major role of Gerald Fitz-
jgerald, mada.me’s husband, was not
lwholly satisfactory partly because
ibis voice was at times not loud
enough to be heard and partly be-
cause he went out of character now
and then.

The story centers about the tem-
peramental Madame Lisa whose hus-

band has grown tired of chasing her
{from concert to concert about the
lworld. He loves quiet evenings at
lhoine and such creature comforts as
carpet slippers, toasted shins and a
hearthside. So he decides to divorce
his wife and marry Flora. Preston, a
widow who sliares his enthusiasm for‘
a quiet home life. All ends well,

though, when Gerald comes to the
madame to talk about the future of
their son. They decide to have a
farewell dinner that ends in their
reconciliation.

Two scenes of the play are especi-_

ally noticeable: the one wherein the

room is rearranged to suit madame’s
taste, and the one wherein madame

rushes her servants to pack her bags ’

before the hurried “elopenient” with
her husband. Poor direction could
could have easily ruined the play by
making a mere burlesque of those
scenes; as performed, they stood out
as two of the
scenes in the" production.

Plenty of laughs are furnished by

4..

most eiitertaining

T

, Sunny” Weslager, madame’s Italian
gchef, and Jean Stotler, madame’s ec-
i centric but loyal maid. They actually
steal the acting honors in the few
scenes in which they appear. Ba.rba1'a
Ami Hartmami, who plays Mrs. Flora
Preston, gives» reality to a difficult
role, while Richard Lambie, as John,
madame’s son, acts his part convinc-
ingly. Special notice should be
given to Israel Goldberg who makes
the part of inadame’s doctor amusing
and to Ambrose Meyer, Louise Cris-
pen, and Jessie Viclithenstain who
handle satisfactorily the other minor
roles.

Since the ﬁrst performance was a
mere “dress rehearsal,” it is hoped to
see a. great improvement in the next
two performances of “Enter Ma-
dame,” one to be staged at the Heinz
Little Theater Wednesday, the other
to be the ﬁnal performance for the
students at the YM-YVVHA auditorium
on Thursday.

ProFessor’s Disarmament

Statement ‘A

Dr. Francis D, Tyson, professor of
economics, has begun what may be
an intellectual controversy by taking
exception to the statements on dis-
armament of Prof. Russell J. l«‘ergu-
son and Prof. Ev-an T. Sage, quoted in
last Friday’s issue of the Pitt News.

 

Professor F'e1'guson was quoted as,

saying", “The United States is not yet
ready for disarmament. Perhaps it
would‘ be well to build a large navy
and intiniidate European countries
into paying their debts when it is
possible to do so.” '

Must Have Peaceful Agreement

This sentiment, according to Pro-
fessor Tyson, is both “absurd and
dangerous.” He believes that no pay-
ment of debts is possible without
peaceful agreement between nations,
and that the example of France as
collector of German reparations clear-
ly shows the futlity of force in col-
lection.

Dr. Sage’s statement stressed the
fact that disarniament is undesirable
because, “There is little more pros-
pect of enduring peace between na-
tions than of continuous harmony be-
tween individuals.”

 

Copr.. 1932. '7 _.
The American ; ‘
Tobacco Co. ‘—

bsiird’--- Tyson

In reply to this, Professor Tyson
(said, “This idea is reactionary and
lunrealistic. ‘World economic conditions,
inecessitate disarnianient, for as Dr.i
i_Julius Curtius of Germany said here
last week, ‘armaments are the single
major political obstacle to economic
cooperation in Europe.’ This prob-
'lem must be overcome before we can
ﬁnd prosperity again. Reduction of
expenditures on armaments is essen-
tial to any sound program of economy
and such a program of 1'eti'enchInent
is inevitable. Law must just as sure-
ly replace conflicts in international re--
lations a-s it has replaced the duel in
personal relations.”

‘Supports Hoover ‘Method

Profession Tyson supports the
Hoover method of dealing with land
armaments, advocating a one-third‘ re-
duction by all nations. “The United
States,” he stated, “is in a position to
lead in advocating naval disarma-
ments at the VVashington and Lon-
don Conferences.”

Asked his opinion of the result of the
presidential election on our foreign
policy, he saw little chance of change

  
  

for the future, “altliougli there should

 

 E buy the ﬁnest, the
very finest tobaccos

be under Roosevelt,” he argued,
“greater open-mindedness toward in-
ternational agreemeiits concerning

foreign trade."

Huskers Hold
Pa :1 t l1 e rs To
Scoreless Tie

Mathis and Sauer Outshine
Heller and Sebastian
During Game

‘Threaten In 3rd Period

For the second time this year, the
Golden Panthers emerged from a foot-
ball game with a. scoreless tie for
their efforts. At Lincoln, Nebraska,
Saturday, the Cornhuskers massed
their attacks to prevent their guests
from tallying, and in doing so cover-
ed themselves with glory by almost
sending their eastern opponents ﬂying
from the undefeated lists of the
country.

By the valiant efforts of the Pan-
ther line and the running attack of
Heller and Sebastian at crucial mo-
ments of the game were the Huskers
prevented from spoiling that unde-
feated record which the Panthers
had carried with them into the mid-
west section of the country.

Headed by little Chris Mathis, 147-
pound halfback, a.nd George Sauer,
fullback, t.he Huskers threw them-
selves viciously at the Panthers
throughout the 60 minutes of the
game, but were stopped only by a
bracing of Pi.tt’s line at times when a.
few feet meant a score.

Pitt threatened in the third quar-
ter when Heller broke loose on runs
of 19 and 27 yards, carrying the ball
to the Nebraska’s 16-yard line. Here
the Husker forwards made one of

 

-their finest defensive stands of the

season, taking the ball on their own
14-yard line.

It wa.s Mathis, in the fourth period
who brought the 30,000 blanketed fans
to their feet with a sensational ex-
hibition. Taking the ball on his own
35-yard line, he reeled off a pair of
ﬁrst downs in two plays, and a few
moments later, on an 18-yard dash,
was brought down by Sebastian on
Pitt's 19-yard line.

VVith only two minutes to go, the
Huskers elected to place kick, the
ball going only to the 3—yard line.

Sutherland started his shock troops
but shortly before the ﬁrst quarter
put in his regulars after the Huskers
had passed their way to Pitt's 20-yard
line.

Nebraska held the edge over Pitt
in the matter of ﬁrst downs, piling up
13 to Pitt’s 11, and gaining 277 net
yards to the Panthers’ 198.

Calls All-Women Meeting

For Tomorrow

 

Tomorrow from 12 to 1:30 o'clock
WAA will sponsor a mass meeting
for all women students on the Pitt
campus in the Heinz House. In co-
operation with all the class organiza-
tions VVAA will announce at the
meeting the plans made for inter-
class competition. Lunch and tea
will be served to all women present
for ﬁfteen cents; because of this, all
women who wish to attend the meet-
ing are requested to sign up at the
hostess tables in Heinz House by 4
o’clock today. The speaker of the
meeting will be Dr. Lotte Lol1stet-
ter who will talk on “The Value of

Athletics as Recreation for College
VVomen.”

WAA has made complete plans for
the interclass competition which be-
gins after Thanksgiving vacation with
the introduction of the winter sports
schedule. Bounceball, handball, ping
pong, rifles and many other sports
will be offered. The physical educa-
tion majors will be separated from the
non—majors so that there will be more,
equal competition. At the -end of the‘
year VVAA will award a bronze plaque
to the class gaining the most points
in the athletic contests. The exiecu-'
tive board of each class has selected
a sports -chairman whose committee
will assist in the managing of the
sports. Sports chairmen chosen are
Helen Seder, Col. ’35; Harriet Sloan,
Ed. ’34; Estella VVOods, Ed. ’33. The
freshmen, who will participate in the
intraclass competition, will have a
representative after their election-
Thursday, November 2". These sports
chairmen will judge the proper
time for practice in conjunction with
the physical education department
and will encourage the women of their
class to participate.

 

Depression Remedied

According To Lawn
Wo rkm en

Depression, a main topic of
conversation today, has been rem-
edied, at least as far as the
Forbes street lawn of the Cathe- ,
dral of Learning is concerned.

‘Workmen have just ﬁnished ﬁll-
ing in a large kidney-shaped plot
of ground below the second ter-
race on the rear lawn of the Ca-
thedral. The “depression” was
discovered early last wec-k by the
University landscape gardener,
and men were immediately put to
work cutting away the sod. The
ground was then leveled, and the
sod replaced.

Though the chief gardener said
.the depression was due to a de-
fective ﬁll when the lawn was
laid out, the other men insisted
that it was the last minute effects
of the Hoover administration.

More Than Fifty Candidates
Out For Boxing Team

 

More than ﬁfty candidates for the
boxing team served notice that foot-
ball does not hold‘ the center of attrac-
tion for them by answering Coach
Orsini’s call for boxing material.
Among the candidates that greeted

Orsini at Trees Gym were many
freshmen and sophomores.

Conti and Santicola were the only
veterans on hand from last year’s
team, but the list will be enlarged by
the addition of Captain Siegel,Schrick-
er, and Shotwell who will report at
the close of the football season. In
addition, several likely prospects
from last year’s intramural tourament
a.re expected to help round out a com-
plete squad.

As has been the custom in the past,
the majority of the candidates were
in the lighter classes, although there
were entrants for the 160 and 175
pound classes.

The program for the year was out-
lined to the enthusiastic group by
Coach Orsini, and the remainder of
the time was- given over to a partial
distribution of equipment. Practices,

soul who adds summer schools to
his worries.

Pitt is really quite an elevating

one year every student has climbed
a mile and three quarters nearer to

a mile and three quarters, according
to the old‘ principle that what goes

Pitt Players They may learn——perl1aps only

ITH its ﬁrst vehicle, “Enter

Ma-dame,” ready for campus
presentation, Pitt Players is show-
ing some promise of another suc-
cessful dramatic season.

Last year Director Carl Cass
gave us Andl'eyev’s tragedy, “He
W110 Gets Slapped,” Ferenc Mol-
nar’s social satire, “The Swan,”
and Noel Coward’s comedy, “Hay
Fever,” three superb plays that
Players handled with a ﬁne cle-
gree of amateur dexterity. Yet
neither the cast nor the technical
staff received anything like their
share of applause from anyone
outside a small circle of admi1'-
ers in associated activities.

Fortunately, Players’ success is
not measured in terms of proﬁt-
able box office returns and a “full
house.” Long ago the members
of the dramatic organization
learned‘ that, no mattter how
great their effort nor how ﬁne
their performance, they could
not hope for the measure of stu-
dent support “in the theater” that
they deserve.

Parents’ Reception

Y SATURDAY morning mem-

bers of the Freshman class
will have learned from their own
parents in what regard they are
held by University faculty mem-
bers and administrators, and just
how successful they have been in
the ﬁrst important eight weeks of
scholastic activities.

The latter information proba-
bly will be held by the parents
of the members of the class of
1936 as the most important bit of
knowledge they received by at-
tending the Cha.ncellor’s recep-
tion. Certainly, the scholastic
standing of each student is re-
garded by all concerned as the
measuring stick of success. And
that, while most applicable for
freshmen, is yet not entirely true.

Information of greater impor-
tance than grades may be
gleaned by parents from Friday
evening’s contacts with the per-
sons who have had most to do
with freshmen students since
classes began on September 26.

slightly, at ﬁrst——just how suc-
cessful John and Mary have been
in working with strangers in an
entirely new environmeiut, just
how successful they have been in
the all-important business of
“living" with others. Faculty
members, a-dministrative officers
and directors of activities can
best estimate that success, and
by reason of their past experience
can b-est interpret its signiﬁcance
for anxious elders.

Women ’s Rushing

ITH the modiﬁcation of
“Fal1 Bid Day” to include
but one social event for each wo-
man fraternity rushee, Panhel-
lenic -Council has reduced the ex-
penses of fraternity rushing to
an absolute minimum and yet l1as
strengthened the system of rush-
ing now being enforced by the
fraternity governing body.

The new system is a mean be-
tween the two systems which
were in use previously, and com-
bines the best points of each. It
is not as expensive as the three
day rushing period and‘ yet al-
lows for contacts between fra-
ternity women and rushees which
last year's bid day did not.

The stipulation ma-de by Pan-
hellenic that each rushee shall
attend only one affair has been
criticised on the basis that the
purpose of rushing is to have
rushees meet the various groups.
However, council claims it is gell-
erally understood‘ that fal1 rush-
ees have had time to center
their interest in one group dur-
ing the past semester, Pan11el-
lenic has, as well, made provi-
sions for rushees to meet other
groups before making their ﬁnal
selections. If a rushee refuses a
fraternity invitation because she
wishes to meet another group
whom she does 11ot know so well
as the ﬁrst, she may give her rea-
son in her refusal. Thus frater-
nities may bid women who have
not attended their affair.

Regardless of all the argu-
ments either way, the only ones
who can testify to the success of
the new system are the rushees,
and their testimony will not go
on ﬁle until Friday night.

Business Sciioof Freshmen
  Ending Fe rma! Conferences

 

Freshman conference, which is re-
quired of all freshmen who are reg-
istered in the School of Business Ad'-
ministration, will conclude its formal
meetings after the Thanksgiving hol-
idays. The class was organized at
the beginning of the semester, and
meets during the second hour on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Car-
negie lecture hall. The course carries
no credit that can be counted to-
wards graduation.

Although this year is only the sec-
ond one during which a course spe-
ciﬁcally designated as “Freshman
Conference" has been offered, the
history of the present course dates
-back about six years. At that time
there was no Freshman conference,

but a course called Senior conference,
designed to provide vocational guid-
ance and business contacts.

Since seniors had no idea of the
ﬁelds of study that were open to
them, the School of Business Admin-
istration saw the need of showing
freshmen the opportunities in the se-
lection of proper electives.

The present Freshman conference

   

tain aids on how to study, how to
choose a vocation; the course should
stimulate student interest in current
phases of business. The last is par-
ticularly important in this period of
depression when business is undergo-
ing fundamental changes, when
events of vital importance to our eco-
nomic structure occur daily, and our
business must evolve with new em-
phases.”

All the speakers do not discuss
business. The course includes such
ﬁelds as psychology, philosophy, the
art of living, and health. Each
speaker has met with the group and
talked about the ﬁeld which he rep-
resents. At the last meeting, Mr,
Armbruster will formally close the
conference by giving a summary of
the events that have occurred in the
course.

Although the course is formally
scheduled to close after the Thanks-
giving vacation, Mr. Armbruster is
planning to organize a group of stu-
dents who wish to continue the work
of the conference. Those who take
this opportunity will be afforded the

chance of organizing among them-
selves and of inviting their own
speakers.

 

CREAM OF THE
COLLEGES

Oh, Mr. Volstead!

‘Evidently anticipating a change in
the present liquor laws, the Wall]-
Henius Institute of Fermentati.on at
Chicago is now in session after a re-
cess of» seventeen:--years.’ The “beer

since 1915 with an enrollment of nine-
teen students. The college offers
courses in chemistry, physics, bacter-
iology, yeast culture, refrigeration and
botany.

the disasters of the war years, Hit-
ler’s- medieval jingo was aimed.
VVith Ge’rman_Fascism on the slide,
it is likely that Hitler's gangsters,
who took the romantic name of

wait for that repair—-in vain, of “storm troops,” will desert him. His
course. ﬁnancial and popular support fell
Mr. Roosevelt knows what must be away after the last €1eCti0n- The de-

done. And he probably -would like
to do those things. But can, he, even“
assuming that he is willing‘ to sacri-
ﬁce his own political ., future? ~. He
was elected to office by a population"
that voted its sentiments and thirsts;
From that popular support he can ex-
pect no -understanding of the relation
between war debts, tariffs and their
unpopular off-spring depression; ,

For actual execution of any move,
that Mr. Roosevelt might wish tol
make, he must depend upon the mot-
ley crews of. the Senate and the
House, a strange mixture of lynch- .
nigger Democrats from_ the South,
whiskey and beer Democrats from
the. North, and cheap-money
Democrats from the West. Any man
who could get cooperation on a fund-
amental, economic measure from a
bunch like that ought to be made
King, not President.

Restoration Difficult

The restoration of “normalcy,” thati
is, the revival of international trade;
and -domestic agriculture, and the!
hundred other odd jobs that must be{
done if capitalism is not to. remain all
complete wreck, will require some un—i
pleasant action from the government.,-
Somebody’s toes will be stepped out
Particularly from the industries that
have grown up under Republican pro,
tection there will be a cry against ai
reduction in tariffs. The job ahead‘.
for Mr. Roosevelt on the tariff issue!
is no easy one. Reduction is impera-i
tive, bllt the common Americans,
judgment on this matter has been so}
warped by propaganda and patriotisml
that attempts for a sane policy seem'
hopeless. t

And the War Debt 

Allied with the tariff problem is}
the business of a twenty billion war}
debt owed the United States. Andi
war debts present the ne plus ultra;
ﬁeld for political suicide.

The lnost laughable aspect of Mr.
Hoover's policy lay there. He in-
sisted (although not very forcibly)
that these debts be paid. And at the
same time, he refused to lower tariffs
and permit Europe to sell us her
goods—tl1e only way under heaven in
which these -debts could be paid. No
wonder then that Europeans refer to
us as Uncle Shylock, considering that
we demanded payment and all the
while were refusing the payment of-
fereid.

A Wet -Solution

Mr. Hoover, it nlust be said to his
credit, made no more a fool of him-
self than are the newspaper corre-
spondents who now suggest that this
twenty billion debt can be paid off in
edible alcohol. You can get a. lot of
beer and wine for twenty billion dol-
lars. Almost too lnuch. It is an es-
pecially amusing fallacy in view of
the fact that the very newspapers
which now advocate that America
drink Europe out of -del:-t were a few
months ago ballyhooing “true tem-
perance.”

With other young Americans, I look
forward to a civilized age in which
drink can be el1J'oye-d in some place
other than a dingy speakeasy. But I
am not such a fool as to advocate the
settlement of an international pl'ob-
lem by the expediency of one nation
going 011 a wholesale drunk. The
past tllree depression years have been
all the headache that I care for.

No lVloi'e Nazis

It was good‘ news from Gerlnany
last week that the beginning of Herr
Hitler’s end has arrived. It would be
even better news that Fascism every-
where is on the decline. For it is
that adulterated Facism, nationalism,
that has been and is still to blame for
the b1'ea.k(lown of El.lrope"s economy
as well as ours.

Bllt I-Iitler’s program, aside from its
absurd anti-Semitism. its Fatherland’
devotion, and its Klu Klux embell-
ishments, was a threat to a new spir-
it in post-war Germany. Against this
new spirit which is expressing itself
in architecture and the other arts, and
in a will to prevent a repetition of

‘I50 Workers

la real thrill is derived from iloing a

cline of Hitler and his counterparts
means an internationally minded Eu-
rope. The economic adjustment neces-
sary, _ with a little encouragement,
"ought to follow.

It pays to be a track star!
Linwood Thiessen, a member of
the varsity track team and a win-
ner of two medals in the intra-
school track meet held recently,
is now raising thanks to heaven
that he can run.

Thiessen was on the second
ﬂoor of a building a few days ago.
When he glanced out of the win-
dow, it was to see a small boy
making away with some article
from his parked machine. Only
a few oaths were sounded before
the hurdler was off and away
ai'ter- the lad, The chase led down
a main thoroughfare-, through sev-
eral alleys, and ﬁnally into a.
court. After rounding tl1o corner,
he saw the boy climbing over a
wall. Lengthening his stride zi.
bit, Thiessen cleared the wall and
caught the thief.

He dragged the boy back to his
machine, and, after a search to
see if any articles in addition to
those recovered were taken, he
turned the youngster loose with
the admonition: “After this
you’d better stealtfrom some one
who can’t run.”

last year.

The Fund drive on the campus is
-being headed by Dr. Samuel B. Lin-
hart, secretary of the University. He
will have charge of the faculty and
administration section of the Uni-
versity program, with VV. W. Mendeli-
hall. executive secretary of the
YMCA, will handle the student drive.

So far as possible the drive will be
carried on in groups. Individual so-
licita.tion will be made alnong seniors.
and juniors in the College and School
of Education, and seniors in the
School of Business Administration.
The Schools of Dentistry, Pllarnlacy,
Law, and Medicine will conduct indi-
vidual drives.

Outlining the necessity of such a
campaigli among students for the
Vvelfare of those not so fortunate,
Miss Mary J. Condon, secretary of
the Family W'elfare Association, and
professor of sociology on the campus
yesterday told students of the urgent
need of funds for the alleviation of
the distress of many families in this
city and its environs, citing cases of
extreme poverty in such families.

Reed P. Rose, Dent. '33 (fl1«’.ill‘lIl€1ll
of Student Council, told students that

real piece of work. “This,” he said,
“is a. real as well as a worthy piece
of work that you are about to do.”

There’s just one thing to do——and

good tobacco. A pipe helps a man
get down to straight thinking. Col-

smoking tobacco without a rival.
That’s Edgeworth.*

Here’s an idea. Fill your pipe
with Edgeworth Smoking Tobacco
and light up. Now———take a good long

before? Of course not, for Edge-
worth is a distinctive and different
blend of fine old burleys.
