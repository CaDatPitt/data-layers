Continued Improvement
In 1935 Business

Note Demand For Goods 

By David Fagan

Business is on the upswing, say .

officials of ﬁve great industrial
organizations
district, and, in special interviews

with The Pitt News, they voiced;
conﬁdence in the economic prom-E

ise of the new year.

Presidents of two corporations, vice s

presidents of two others, and a rep-
resentative of a ﬁfth issued state-
ments in which the predominant note
seemed to be that the upturn is not
sporadic and temporary,
the establishment of a permanent im-
provement. Stressed particularly was
the widened market for consumers’
goods, after
and under-distribution.

Frank R. Phillips, president, Phila-
delphia company:

There has been a noted improve-
ment in all lines of endeavor during
the past few months, and I’m sure
that the new year will see a continu-
ance of the concerted drive against
the depression. This continuance
will see an improvement in the liv-
ing standards for many with the fu-
ture of a basic prosperity for all.

However the upswing will be grad-
ual and may be accompanied by dis-
concerting downtrends which we hope
will be short-lived. The "American
people have a ﬁghting heritage and
with such a background a successful
drive against the depression cannot
be thwarted.

H. S. Wherrett, president,
burgh Plate Glass company:

Pitts-

VVe are sincerely hoping for an in--

creasing‘ volume of business in 1935.
The expected increase in automobile
sales, the forceful impetus of the
Housing Act will be helpful in our
particular line of endeavor. In gen-
eral the experience gained by busi-
ness during the depression will be
invalua.ble to a. general upturn. Pro-
ducers and consumers will both wel-
come the change for the better, but
the magnitude of the upward swing
remains to be seen. Let us hope that

a. general improvement will be per-l

manent.

L. H. Burnett, vice president, Car-
negie Steel company:

We are hoping for a general grad-
ual improvement in business during
1935. There exists at present a bet-
ter, emphasized air of conﬁdence than
was prevalent during the pa.st dismal
years. A gradual uplift seems to be
the sign of the time. Although there
may occur certain phases of a down-
treud, these may be interpreted as
cyclical and the upward movement
will offset any effort of business ob-
struction.

R. S. Euler, vice president, Union
Trust company:

Assuming a wise and conservative
policy and attitude on the part of gov-
ernment in relation not only to its
own affairs but also to American bus-

iness and individuals in general, busi-i
ness conditions should gradually im--.

prove during the future period, be-
cause there exists a considerable lag
which the urge to maintain present,
standards of living must overcome if
present standards are to be maintain-
ed.
In

other words,

the volume of production
sumption will have to be increased
considerably above the present rate.

S. L. Walworth, representative
The Ohio Brass company:

Business is gradually on the up-:
The conﬁdence of the peopleé

turn.
in hoping for a change for the better

has quenched the wails of the die-§

hards. The prevalent need for home
necessities will add a decided _impet11s
to the producing industries. Let us-
hope that the upturn will 11ot be
sporadic; that its effects be not ﬂeet-

Salty Sidewalks
Save Skulls

If an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure, the Uni-
versity building and grounds cle-
partment cures about 1,760,000
pounds of sprained ankles, broken
legs, and cracked skulls each win-
ter.

In other words, without being
arithmetically whimsical, it takes
an annual average of 75 hundred-
pound bags of salt to “kill” the ice
and slush on the campus side-
wa ks. Some years the total is
as high as 15.000 rounds, while
in more mild years as little as
5.000 pounds are needed to pre-
vent students from breaking their
necks on University propert_v.

“We try to beas sparing as pos-
sible,” the reporter was told. “as
the salt is harmful to the grass
and shrubbery around the walks.
But we’d rather not spare the
salt and spoil the students.”

 Came On Hoi:

 For the last three years or so,
‘ only freshmen have ever bother-
ed to turn the faucets marked
‘‘Hot’' in Cathedral washrooms.
More erudite upperciassrnen knew,
of course, that hot water was one
of those phenomena of civilization
which never seemed to have
touched Pitt’s tall building,

But 1934, before it turned that
vicious corner which relegated it
to the history books, stayed
long enough to see a bit of local
history in the making. On the-
; last day of the old year, a young
j chap, J. Lucius Hassenplug,

 on some rather vague business,

Swanli Will Conductulvew
 ' ‘“Course' In 'Ph‘o‘t“o5,g9r&jpﬁy’

A small group of about 12 or 15
upperclassmen next semester will
learn the importance of the business
end of a. camera from the standpoint
of a newspaper.

Listed as Journalism 110, two
credits, a course will be given each
Tuesday and Thursday, sixth hour,
with Luke Swank, University pho-
tographer, as instructor,

Admission is by special permission
of llilr, Swank, and will be limited.

According to Vvilliam S. Maulsby,
professor and head of the department
of journalism, the course will attempt
to train students in the uses of news-
paper cameras, and in photography in
general. ‘Such a course, he said,
should prove useful to those who will
work for papers which outﬁt rep01'te1‘s
with small cameras, to future manag-
ing editors in selecting good photo-
graphs froiu mediocre ones, and may
even qualify students to start out on
newspapers as regular staff photogra-
pliers.

lwhile eminent scientists expounded
theories on many subjects, and fre-

protons and electrons, hormones,
chromosomes, cosmic rays, molecules,
etc., bewildered laymen read lengthy
newspaper accounts and sighed.

Professor Albert Einstein, the
famous relativity man, Professor Jean
Piccard, the stratosphere balloonist,
and Dr. Harold C. Urey, Nobel prize
winner for his discovery of heavy wa-
ter, were prominent among the many
luminaries.

Einstein startled the convention by
asserting his doubt that the energy
of the atom will ever be harnessed.
He demonstrated his theorem on the
equivalence of mass and energy be-
fore the chosen delegates, who were
unanimous in declai-in_r2; his explana-
tion t.o be perfectly lucid.

Heredity Predominant

Heredity was shown to be stronger
than environment, Extensive obser-
vations of twins reared apart showed
much similarity between them. It
was disclosed, however, that a twin
with a college education was more in-
telligent than his brother or sister
who had quit school in the seventh
grade.

The virtue of mother love, which
was once thought to be spiritual, is
now l)-elieved to be chemical. A sub-
stance called prolactiii is responsible.

were declared far more serviceable

In the meeting of economists, Roose-
velt was hailed and flailed, Much
controversy raged over the respective
merits or follies of his policy. No

Students More Radical

In the psychology section. the start-
ling: assertion was made that College
students have grown more radical
during the past few hectic years, and
that high school students were not so
radical as their teaclie-rs. Consider-
able agreeinent was found between
college students and their parents.

The much-coveted prize of $1,000
for the delivery of the best paper on

Dr. Verne C. Knudsen of the Univer-

critical of the Communist Interna-
tional, and is a member of the Inde-
gpendent Labor Party.

In addition to the address at the

The 1934 program of Sigma Xi, hon-
orary science lraternity, ended on
December 28 with the 35th annual

As representatives of the University
lexplained (hiring the hearings on the
lproposed tax, the Stadium ha.s never
lbeen let. to private enterprises since
;its completion in 1925.

‘ Mixed Lounge Assured

Now that the steam heating systeni
in the Cathedraal has been successful-
ly tested, a. mixed lounge on the sixth
floor is assured, says Mr. VVeber.
“Just how soon we will have the
lounge ready we cannot say, but com-
pletion of the piping will mean the
opening of the rooms,” he asserted.

The mixed lounge project, sponsor-
ed by S'FA and headed in the govern-
ing body by Don Campbell, C35. was
first discussed at the October meet-
ing of the group. S-ince that time, ar-
rangements have been made to pro-
vide furnishings and decorations.

Old Houses Removed

During the Christmas holidays, the
nine brick houses facing DeSotzr.
street at O*’I-Iara which the University
bought seven years ago from the
Grierson estate have been torn down.
Purchased in order to complete the
University property, the corner dwell-
ings were retained until they l)€C'cl-I118
teuantless a short time ago.

It was explained by University of-
;licials yesterday that the houses
;“were never worth much,” and were
Ekept standing only by sufferance.
i “We wanted only the land,” they add-
ed.

Since 1931, the DeSot-a-O’Haru.‘
street lot has been State property,
given by the University for the site of
a W'estern Pennsylvania Psychiatric
hospital. Should the hospital he built,
approximately half of the Y hut would
be dismantled, or the hut would be
swung back toward the Stadium. The
hospital plot extends along 0’I-Iara
street to within 50 feet of the wooden
buildings erected during the war.

; There is no present prospect of hos-
:pital construction, however. and the
iUniversity will retain the land until

like “the non-interference of government” can be

elsewhere are mildly optimistic about business
prospects in 1935. Not the most enthusiastic, how-

Charles Lamb, As He Seems
The First 100 Years After

By George Carver

In the early afternoon of Thursday,
Dec. 27, 1934, Charles Lamb had
been dead one hundred years.

0 WRITE ABOUT Charles Lamb  to remind oneself

of Sainte-Beuve’s suggestion to a. gentleman who was
thinking of writing about Montaigne: “Set down noth-
ing that you would not be proud to have him see.” For
as I trace these words I am only too well aware that “a
ghost can laugh and shake its gaunt sides,” and I fear—
even across the width of a century—to incur the stam-
inered jest which must surely arise were those bantering
eyes to scan these pages—just as, questionless, it has
risen (to the seraphic glee of the shades gathered about
him in the Elysium which must somehow resemble the
rooms above the ironmongery in Great Russell street)

each time during the long century passing anyone has
attempted a comment.
jest will be foregone; it were not seemly that

But perhaps in this instance the

Olympus to a. molehill should
Less than Olympus be.

"However, foregone or forthcoming, it must be risked;

the occasion is such that no true Agnophile can with-
hold his sentiments, “unlicked, incondite, villainously
pranked out” though they are.

There is a hint of prophecy in remarking the first one
hundredth anniversary of a memorable death. So short
is human life and so narrow its compass that for the
name of any human being to become the inheritance of
posterity through so long a period must assuredly
promise for him the eternity of n1en’s minds. And if
that name, upon the mention, suggest even grace notes
in the scale of human triumph—-leaving octave chords
for the mightier than itself—then assurance is by twice
its mea.sure sure.

And is not Charles Lamb among these last? Not be-
cause he is of the company of accomplished stylists so
much as because he was a. man? He has not gone . .
to join “the old familiar faces.” It is not just Elia who
remains. The dark brooding countenance of Hazlitt, the
restless hands of Hunt, the diminutive ﬁgure of De
Quincey are no more than shadows ﬂickering behind
their pages, yet Lamb emerges into “the light of com-
mon day.” The “immaterial legs,” the somewhat “Jewish
cast” of face, the “decent black," the slightly ill-matched
eyes, and over all the “smoky, drinky” (Mary's phrase)
aura of one

Contented if he might enjoy

The things that others understand——
these have contrived in memory with “Mrs. Battle,”
“Christ's Hospital," “Chimney Sweepers,” “Roast Pig,"
and the rest to make reality doubly real. VVe love Elia,
but we mourn Charles Lamb.

It is the true wedding of the mind with sorrow from
which the immortal springs, whether in life or in art.
‘And from such a source came the spirit of Lamb, in-
stance and example of both. else how could he so simply
have implied his victory over the tragic action of Mary,
over his own incipient madness, and over the extinguish-
ing drudgery of his daily task? From the youthful, but
no less keen, awareness of the message to Coleridge,
“the six weeks that finished last year and began this
your very humble servant spent very agreeably in :1 mad-
house at Hoxton,” through the heartbreaking, “We are
not of Alice, nor of thee, nor are we children at all .

We are nothing. less than nothing, and dreams,” to the
resolute sympat,hy——despite its futilit_v—of “You must go
first, Mary,” moves a character more than competent to

Of Providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,
Fix’d fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute;
and yet it is lightness, quaintness, deft humor that per-
vade his writings. “My Relations.” “Mackery End,”

Arpeggios instead of resounding chords, faint melancholy
when the tragic lay nearest to hand, :1 pun when tears
would have served another, Elia guiding the hand of
L-amb. and one is limned whom art and living alike have
rescued from oblivion.

He was an uncontemporaneous Wight who thought
himself an expert in inaction. Nevertheless the whole
of his experience is a friction against dullness. But,
strangely enough, he makes an extraordinary appeal to
the chill. I-Iis fame is beyond cavil secure, but no little
responsibility for its continuance has been assumed by
the solomonic. He is spoken of in “trim gardens” by
pale gentlemen to pale ladies with throats ribboned in
black veivet. The market place, where the best years of
his life were passed and where his “works” accumulated
in terms of calico and long rows of ﬁgux-es—“more MSS.
in folio than ever Aquinas left”—remembers him only
by the portrait that hangs in India House. He who was
“defrauded in his young years of the sweet food of
academic institution" now reposes between the covers of
a thousand school books—winding-sheets for the “sci-
ential apples” of his genius. And he who of a Saturday
night long ago fared forth from Islington to Edmonton to
lug home a folio Beaumont and Fletcher sadly in need
of “collating” (his word for it, according to Mary) could
today be shown the MS. of his all-but—overwhelming
“Dream Children” behind steel doors, safe enough from
any need of “collating" but not safe. from the dust of cor-
rupting dullness.

He once begged Coleridge to call him “drunken-dog,
ragged-headed. seld-shaven, odd-eyed, stuttering,” any-
thing but “gentle-hearted Cliai-les.” Once, ‘too, he frog-
leaped the shoulders of a bishop. Gin and hitters ob-
tained, perhaps, an undue-« share of his attention, to say
nothing of shag tobacco. Hazlitt had reason to complain
of the treatment he received in the affair of the adver-
tised death. The Comptroller of Stamps, the young poet
whose verses Lamb appropriated at a dinner-party, and
the lady who tried to persuade him of the excellence of
her pastor only to have him exclaim, “Damn him at :1
venture, Madam; d-d-damn him at a venture”——not one
of these had cause to think him gentle-hearted, or oven
kind. And yet the dull insist upon the reference. “Gen-
tle Elia” they call him, except when it is “Saint Charles.”
And they go on to point out the Burton-like quality of his
conceits, the Sir Thomas Browne-ishness of his vocabu-
lary, and the romanticism of his cast of thought. “Surely
a ghost can laugh.”

If he is to be called gentle, it must be in the sense,
as Mr. Lucas reports Vvilliam Archer’s having said,.that
Chaucer, 'Walton, Goldsmith and Sir Vvalter Scott were
gentle, :1. sense impossible to apply to Samuel Johnson,
Milton or Carlyle; or better yet, in the sense set forth
by Shakespeare’s Anthony:

His life was gentle; and the elements

So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up

And say to all the world, “This was a man.”
And if he remain even partly the :?nherit_ance of the dull,
one must view askance Sir Joshua Reyno1ds’s ‘."The
greatest man is he who forms the taste of a. nation; the
next greatest,-he who debases it”; either that or accept
the next greatest in pa.tro11al subservience, remember-
ing the “Anthony Adverses,” the Durantes, the Vallees,
and the school of the needlessly doleful.

Be that as it may, we cannot live except by contrasts.
In the kingdom of the perfect, perfection is obscured.

Had it not been for the Dyers, the Talfourds, the Pat-'

mores of his day, Lamb could not have shone in such
bright relief; just as today_ if we lacked drivel,
cacophony, fatuity, we could not so much enjoy the tran-
quillity of a style redolent of quiet smiles, the heroism of
a soul resigned to inhibition, the self-realization of an
ioticist to whom ~
Nature gave for a defense
His formidable innocence.

And yet perhaps our world is, after all, too much of the
world for us to value highly one whose turn for the tem-
poralities was so slight. Charles Lamb, next to Shake-
speare and Samuel Johnson, the best known name in
the literature, has been by much less widely read. A
disappointed poet, an abortive dramatist, he came into
notice one August day in 1820- as an essayist in the Lon-
don Magazine, one who despite “the contagion of the
world’s slow stain” was able to grasp the little that was
sweet and lasting in his experience and to give it form.
As piece by piece it grew, 3. mosaic appeared which
“neither time nor much handling” can deface; but who
who sees it can comprehend in full its intricate design?
A Proteus rising from the sea, :3. Triton blowing a
wreathed horn, 3. Perseus becoming a stax'——but who to
behold the miracle?

Only a handful, and they not all—beholding. They real-
ize the brave ill-luck and yet can think the jest an un-
summoned 'itnes-s to lightness of heart. None the less,
they are prepared to vouchs-afe the whole as the “too
much thinking with which life melts” and runs together
with the universe. It may all be, of course, no more
than the pious coercion of some gracious se1f—delusion.

Upward, Downward
Trends In Commerce,

Employment End Old Year

By Sidney Horovitz

Sounding a. note of cheer for the New Year, the De-
cember issue of the Pittsburgh Business Review, a
monthly summary of business and economic conditions
in the Pittsburgh district published by the Bureau of
Business Research, reported “a. continued rise in indus-
trial activity and an increase in trade somewhat larger
than seasonal” for both the Pittsburgh district and else-
where in the United States.

“For a period of almost three months the trend of
business has been slowly upward, the ﬁrst sustained ad-
vance since last June,’ the Review stated. “From about
the middle of January to late June the trend in Pitts-
burgh was sharply upward; from late June to early
October, the entire rise of early 1934 was canceled.
Since early October the index has moved irregularly up-
'ward.”

Production of commodities in the Pittsburgh district
also increased moderately in November, according to the
Business Review. In November the adjusted index of

production was 50.5; in October it was 48.3, and in Sep-
tember it stood at 44.8. “Improvement in the iron and
steel industry appears to be gathering momentum as the
year-end approaches,” the Review pointed out.

On the other hand, the Review reports a further small
decrease in the number of people employed in the Pitts-
burgh district between October and November. Since
early summer total employment has been on the decline,
the all-ﬁrms index falling 4.3 per cent, or from 81.3 in
June to 77.8 in November. About 2 per cent more were
employed in November, however, than in November last
year. Likewise combined payrolls of all firms have
shrunk since June from 62.9 to 54.7 in November.
Despite this shrinkage, payrolls in November in the dis-
trict were nearly 5 per cent above those in November

Punxsy Hears No
Curl-'ew Amid Gay
Wild New Year's Eve

By Wilbur D. Clark

Punxsutawney, Pa., Jan. 1.—The old slogan “Have you
ever been in Cincinnati?” might aptly be paraphrased
“Have you ever spent a New Year's Eve in Punxsutaw-
ney?” ‘Well, I just ﬁnished one; I mean a New Year's
Eve in Punxsutawney. Good old Punxsutawney, the
home town of Charles J. Margiotti and Florence Fisher
Parry. The green hills seem to press in towards the
town, Mrs. Parry says. At the present moment they
seem to be mostly stationary, though last night the hills
did waver a bit.

To seek after a figure, New Year's Eve in Punx-
sutawney is like drinking water out of a wine glass;
or possibly drinking wine out of a water glass. I'm
not quite sure which.

There was all manner of gaiety in the town last night.
All of it good sober fun of course. At the Jeﬁerson
theater there was a midnight show featuring a very poor
picture, something about being a.n hour late or some-
thing, and a. vaudeville act of local talent, which talent
seems to be somewhat lacking. The audience enjoyed
booing and throwing cushions and hats at the blues
singers and tap dancers. A good time was had by all.

The following story appeared on the front page of the
Punxsutawney Spirit on June 21, 1905:

“Mary Pavlosky, a domestic in the home of_ Wil-
liam Wall of this place, surprised the family yester-
day by stating that she was going to quit them in
the evening. When asked to give a reason for her
sudden determination Mary blushed and stated that
she was going to be married today. Mary was not
known to have a beau and when asked the name of
her intended she replied that that was a ? She
couldn't answer. She said that her father had
brought her a husband from Patton and told her to
get ready to be married today. Mary seemed to be
well pleased with the arrangement and immediateiy
set about to prepare her trousseau.”

  Letters From Readers

The following letter was ad-
dressed to Raymond Pearlrnan
through the Editor of The Pitt
News:

Dear Mr, Pearlman:

'.l‘houg;h I did turn away from you
with an acidulous expression, I really
[had some hope for you, You reminded

me of the vast differences in interests

'«between yourself, an educated intel-
‘lectual, and the unlearned proletariat.
You reminded me of your respectable,
solid background. There were reasons
for your aloofness. I had judged you
to be a real ‘half—baked’ communist,
a. very common and harmless species
at our colleges, but by your last arti-
cle in The Pitt News I have been
forced to conclude that you are the
most ‘respectable’ and most con-
temptuous of radicals, the tea-time
communist of the ‘parlor bolshevik'
variety.

You who claim to have the inter-
ests of the proletariat at heart—-you
who have unhesitatingly echoed the
phraseology of the revolution——you
who in your allegory even predicted
the workers’ revolution——you have
now placed yourself in the vanguard
of the enemy along with such mis-
leaders as Father Coughlin and Gov-
ernor Olson of Minnesota. You have
claimed your faith in the scientiﬁc
communistic society, yet you deny the
fundamental teachings of Marx. You
want a ‘revolutionary’ party in Amer-
ica. which “should embrace the higher
intellectual stratum.” In other words,
we must convert the entire intel-
lectual class, which is dependent upon,
the present system of society for its
status.-to become through ethical con-»
siderations, the champion of the
“poor, ignorant, powerless prole-
tariat” and send a delegation to the
President demanding socialism in the
name of humanity. thus effecting the
proletarian revolution.

Intellectual Revolution Absurd

The idea of a proletarian revolution
effected by the intellectuals is an ab-
surdity_ I may be accused of dog-
matism when I say that there can be
no successful proletarian revolution,
except one led by the Communist
Party. A careful examination, how-
ever, of the scientiﬁc" tactics of the
C.P., and also the recent history of
the revolutionaxy struggle will bear
me out_ Contrast the success of the
Russian and Hungarian revolutions
under the leadership of the C.P. with
the heroic February struggle of the
Austrian workers which ended in de-
feat because of the sterile, cowardly
and totally unﬁt. leadership of the So-
cialist Party. But of course you ad-
mit that the Socialist Party is sere
and ineffectual. You advocate then a
new revolutionary party about which
no one would say “Oh, those old Com-
munists.” A revolutionary party,
mind you, “to which is attached no
stigma, even though false!” A party
whose actions will be approved by
everybody and which will shy of “vul-
gar maneuvers.”

A revolutionary party

which will

never, never be accused of “hooligan-
ism.” You want a revolutionary
party which can be I'ep~resen1;edvby
“professional groups, doctors and
lawyers especially, with some degree
of. revolutionary proclivities.”
Beautiful Dreams

Come down to earth, Mr, Pearlman,
we have had enough of Utopianists.
These are beautiful dreams which are
charming in the contemplation, Don't
be a romanticist! It is not so dis-
heartening that “in the Eastern hori-
zon we can see no illumination rising
to steer our civilization away from its
inevitable decay.” Take your eyes
and mind out of the sky, M1; Pearl-
man! Look at stern reality about
you. Only from the long oppressed,
enslaved worker can come the power
—the force—which will break his
fetters, destroy his enemies and shat-
ter this gigantic swindle which bleeds
him and robs him of his heritage.

Workers’ Own Salvation

The Communist Party only can lead
this giant because it is the only party
which recognizes that the worker
must free hiniself, and is the only
party which has the practical concept
of the interrelationship of the forces
which bind him. Marxism--Leninism
is a realistic program of revolutionary
class action based upon experiences
of the past and the scientiﬁc analysis
of the trends of today and the past,
which guides the proletariat on the
basis of its actual economic and po-
litical conditions along the road of
unceasing day-to-day struggles devel-
oped from lower to higher forms, to
the climactic act of revolution.

The revolutionary act is, dialec-
tically viewed. the sudden” leap from
the cumulative struggles for partial,
quantitative changes within the con-
ﬁnes of capitalism to the struggle for
the consum;ma.t.e qualitatively differen-
tiated change which abolishes capital-
ism and ushers in the political state
of the proletariat.

Communists Curry No Aloofness

The -Communist International de-
clares: “The party must neither re-
main aloof from daily needs and
struggles of the working class nor
conﬁne its activities exclusively to
them. The task of the party is to
utilize these minor, everyday needs
 a starting point from which to lead
the working class to the revolutionary
struggle for power.”

But you, Mr. Pearlman, choose to
remain aloof, both from the com-
munist organizations and from such
0rga.ni71ati0ns which fight for imme-
diate demands, and yet, you will have
no regard you as sincere in your
faith in communism and emancipation
of the proletariat. As Stalin recently
pointed out, "Resolutions are meaning-
less in themselves and only have sig-
nificance when coupled with action
The criteria of sincerity must be ac-
tive participation.”

lnvectives Logical In Conflicts

No intelligent person would expect
the Chicago Tribune to print any-
thing favorable to communism. No
group or organization will have any-

thing but invective for another group
whose objective is the destruction of
the 'former_ This is all logical, but
yet you, an apparently intelligent per-
son, condemn the entire leadership of
the Communist Party on the basis of
reports of hooliganism ﬂung against
it by its greatest enemies: You cite
the recent alleged disruption of a.
Socialist Party anti-war meet by
communists. Did it ever occur to
you. Mr. Pearlman, that you might be
n1isi11fo1‘1ned,;,7 You may be surprised
to learn that the socialists in reality
began the riot by attacking the small
communistic group who came to the
meeting to plead for :1 united front of
the coniniunists and the socialists. Is
it consistent tlmt this group, which
has so repeatedly striven to effect a
successful united front. in Americ,-,1 as
has successfully been effected in
France. Belgium, and the Saar, should
stoop to disruptive tactics?
Proletariat Must Spurn Peace

VVhy is it that you can so suddenly
forget the great achievements of the
Communist Party leadership in
Europe and Asia. and the great sacri-
ﬁces and struggles of the Communist
Party leaders of the United States,
who are alone in the active struggle
to bring about that revolution which
you yourself :-idvoc-ate, when accused
of acts to which its principles are un-
alicnably opposed? Why is it that
you can so quickly condemn those who
work for the revolution which you
hope will take place without any at-
tempt on your part to verify the truth
of their alleged crime? Yes, your sin-
cerity is to be doubted! Truly, the
proletariat cannot hope or wait for
theintellectuals like Hook, Calvérton.
Johnson, Coughlin, and Pearlman to
hand it the world.

Meet Undefeated

On Stadium Floor

Find Many New Faces In Lineups
Of Teams Which Split Even
In Series Last Season

Frosh Quintets Battle

Once again the warning goes out
that all those basketball fans who
are weak of heart or subject to abnor-
mal pulse beats should stay away
from the sta.dium pavilion tonight.
For it's the Pitts versus the Dukes

again, and the Panthers are out to-.

make it two straight over the men
from Duquesne while the Dukes are
anxious to add to their record of ﬁve
wins in a row.

The whole set-up points toward an-
other typical Pitt-Duke battle, of
which three of the last four have re-
sulted in one-point margins for the
victors. Last year the local clubs
were content with a split series, the
Duquesne ﬁve taking the ﬁrst battle,
31-29, and the Pitt outﬁt evening the
count with a 31-29 victory.

Pitt s’.‘udents are again ad-
vised that the game tonight is
a home game for Duquesne and
that Pitt student books must be
exchanged, with 40 cents, at
the stadium ticket office before
5 o'clock today.

Thus far this year the Panthers
have won ﬁve out of six games, the
ione defeat. being administered by
Northwestern in the second game of
the season. The Dukes, on the other
hand, have not tasted defeat in ﬁve
starts, listing W'aynesburg, Washing-
ton university, Loyola of Chicago,
City College of New York, and Drake
among their victims.

‘Coach Chick Davies has built up
virtually a new ball club this season,
with only Captain Paul Birch remain-
ing from the ﬁve which split. even
with Pitt last season. Davies has
found three sophomores to step up.in-
‘to'the places of the men who have
graduated and the record of this out-
ﬁt thus far shows that the Dukes are
nobody’s push-over.

The Carlson ﬁve will boast two
men who battled the Dukes last year,
Crilbbs and Hughes. An interesting
feature of the game may be a battle
for scoring honors between Capt.ain
Birch and Pitt’s co-captain, Skip
Hughes. Both boys are near the top
in the district's high-scoring lists this
season.

In a preliminary game the little
Panthers will meet the Duke frosh.
This game will get under way at 7
()’clock, with the varsity battle follow-
ing at approximately 8:15.

 The ‘Height of The Battle’ Will Be
Where These Giants Are Tonight

HEY’RE THE TOP, these two
boys who will ﬁght it out‘ at the
center positions tonight as the Pan-
thers meet the Dukes. Pete Noon
(left) is the big man for the Panthers
who will ﬁnd a. wort.hy rival in Ed
Kweller of Duouesne.

Noon is a juiior playing his first
season with the ﬁrst team while
Kweller has stepped into a varsity
berth in his sophomore year. Both
are well over the six foot mark, Pete
going under doorways which are six
foot, ﬁve inches high, and Ed liking

For the second successive year Bcbi

Madden, Pitt tennis star, reached the
quarter-ﬁnal round in the National
Junior indoor tennis championships at
the Seventh Regiment Armory in New
York city, only to be upset. by a
player who eventually became one of
the ﬁnalists.

In this last tournament, held during
the holidays, Alfred Jarvis, Jr., for-
mer national boys’ champion, was the
opponent to stop Bob's advance by
beating him in a sparkling three-set
match, 6-3. 3-6, 6-1 Jarvis went on to
win a straight set victory over Don
Leavens, Northwestern entry, in tho
semi-ﬁnal round and lost to Gilbert

Hunt of Massachusetts Tech in
ﬁnals.

Madden, seeded No. 4 in the play,
was not quite up to par in his tussle
with the lanky 6 foot, 4 inch Jarvis,
reaching top form only in the seconrl
set when he broke the Hackley school-
boy's service twice to win quite easily
by a. score of 6-3. In the ﬁnal set, Jar-
vis, using his height to a good ad-
vantage, storming the net frequently
to score placements, and forcing Bob
into numerous errors, took the decid-
ing set at 6-1.

Previous to this round, Madden had
taken into ca.mp three victims without
the loss of a set.

the big animal that moves its
tail?”

Such questions were just part
of the work that Miss Smith, stu-
dent of the Research Bureau for
Retail Training. was doing dur-
ing the month of December. Be-
fore Christmas, the students of
the Bureau dropped class routine

A different kind of Christmas gift.

.was received by seven members of

the botany department last week,
when they were elected to the Botan-
ical Society of America. ‘

The new members are Phyllis Cook,
graduate assistant, Phillip Walker,
graduate assistant, Ruth_jCui'tis, gradu-
ate student, Herbert McCullough,
president of Collembolae, Herschel
Stone, major in botany, Sister Muriel
Fleming, graduate student, and Sidney
Eastwood, graduate student.

The announcement of the election
was made at the society’s meeting last
’tI_‘hursday during the AAAS coiiveii-

Bruun, Muriel Dils, Ruth Heckler,
Mary Gertrude Herron, Edith l_\'ii'sh-

Dr. Sherrill Speaks

Dr. R. E. Sheri-ill, assistant pro-
fessor of geology, was the speaker at
the‘ meeting of. Collembolae, honorary
natural science fraternity, last night.
Dr, Sherrill spoke on, “The growth
and decay of inountains.” A business
session followed the talk,

However nobody dashed in to the

less accustomed to hearing strange
goings on in abnormal pS3’CllOl0,'.’,‘_V
lectures given by Di‘. VVilliam T.
Root. This one proved to be just an-
other stunt.

In connection with the studies of
desires and emotions, Mr. Brown
demonstrated the use of the galvan-
oineter for the nieasureiiient of
psycho-galvanic response or reﬂex.

If the subject thinks of something
which excites his emotions in some
way, it is assumed that the sympa-
thetic division of the autononiic nerv-
ous system is affected in such a way
that perspiration is induced. In other
words, the greater the emotions, the
greater the amount of perspiration.

If you have tasted the sweat of
your brow, you will know that it is
salty. Salt in a solution is a good
electrolytic agent and off'ers less re-
sistance to electric current.

Therefore, the greater the emo-
tion. the more sweat; the more sweat,

clutched at the terininals. ‘Her eyes

“Now think of the most pleasant
moment of your life,” slyly suggest-
ed Mr. Brown. And as Miss Sochatoff
ruiiiinated, the audience eagerly
watched the light beam. But the
light was disappointing. It did not
fluctuate. Suddenly Mr. Brown
grasped a revolver and ﬁred. The
light spot jumped, but not very far.

By this tiiue the audience was
clamoring for a new subject made of

less “stern stuff.” Adolph Beliren-
berg, "C35, quickly volunteered, and
the result was more satisfactory

VVhile a pretty coed held his hand
and he thought of his most pleasant
experience, the light spot quivered
violently. F’orge'tting that only‘

light beam took a terriﬁc jump. The
experiment was an overwhelming
success.

YWCA Launches Frosh
Membership Campaign

The University YWCA will launch
its freshman membership campaign on
Monday. In other years, new fresh-
man students have been urged to join
the campus organization during tlic
first week of school. but the policy so
far this year has been not to stress
freshman participation in the activities
of the association. Now, almost at
the close of the ﬁrst semester, fresh-
man women will be invited to take
a more active part in YWCA activi-
ties.

International relations will be dis-
cussed by YVVCA cabinet members
on Tuesday afternoon at the ﬁrst
cabiinet meeting for .]aniiary. Re-
ports on books on international rela-
tions whicli are obtainable in the Y
office will be made by members. The
meeting will be held in Heinz House
at 2:30 o'clock. 5*"

Book-ey Profs.

"VVhat good is it, anyway? They
teach them nothing but socialism."

Mayor William Nissley McNaii'
in this manner voiced his opinion
of the economics department
which he hopes to abolish by a
recommendation to the board of
trustees. In an informal inter-
view, Mr. McNair claimed that
economics professors only “read
books and then argue about tliem.”

“Why one of your professors
even says there are no economic
laws and no such thing as natural
rights. But that’s exactly why
we have a depression——we’i'e not
obeying economic laws.”

The Mayor invited his inter-
viewer to “come down to the
Henry George club and learn some
real economics.”

Members of the department
could not be reached for their
views on what constitutes “real
economics.”
