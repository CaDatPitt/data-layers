Gammage rally riles up crowd of 50+

Former ‘Brentwood police chief
Wayne Babish said he was glad that two
of the ﬁve officers present at Jonny
Garnrnage’s death are going back to
court, but added that all ﬁve are responsi-
ble for the black motorist’s death.

Babish, who was ﬁred 27 days after
Gammage’s death in October of 1995,
said during a rally in the William Pitt
Union on Sunday that he lost his job
because oﬁicers were angry that he was

enforcing a strict code of conduct.
Babish says some Brentwood ofﬁ-
cers were drinking while on the job, ver-
bally assaulting motorists, sexually
harassing women, making racist slurs
and operating squad cars while intoxicat-

“Wayne Babish did nothing at that
ofﬁce that he should be ashamed of,” said
his lawyer, Carolyn Mitchell. “It’s your
moral obligation to stand up for those
people being subjected to oppression. He

against his ears, as he colorfully
critiques a movie he saw over the
weekend.

Shooting a glance to the thou-

wall directly behind him, he
smiles.

“Maybe I should give my lis-
teners some music right about
now,” he said, pulling a couple of
CDs from their cases.

For those students spinning
the discs on the fourth ﬂoor of the
Union, WPTS is all about giving
students a chance to listen to

music coming from a wide vari-
ety of genres in an effort to create
a musical “open mind” cam-

Pursuing a radio talk show

Two SGB

hopefuls

make impromptu
speech to students
from rooftop

Zachariah Blott
News Editor

Two Student Government
Board candidates, running as
the Gargoyle Party, began
what they call a “guerilla cam-
paign” on Monday with an
impromptu speech to the stu-
dent body from a first ﬂoor
rooftop near the Fifth Avenue
side of the \V1lliam Pitt Union.

“This is communication,”
shouted candidate Joe Gielata
to approximately 50 students
who stopped to witness the
event. “This is the way it
should be done.”

After unsuccessfully
attempting to make a micro-
phone and speaker work,
Gielata and running mate
Damon Hudac shouted to the
crowd for 10 minutes about the
issues the Gargoyle Party
wants to address.

Foremost, Gielata said

they want to reform the a1loca- '

tions process to “eliminate the
conﬂict of interest that exists
within SGB right now.” They
also mentioned the need for

communication between the
SGB and students — which he
said was their reason for
putting on such a display.

What attracted the most
attention from the crowd,
though, was their plan to put
gargoyles atop the Cathedral of
Learning.

“That building right there
needs gargoyles,” Hudac said,
while pointing to the
Cathedral. “Every year a class
gift is made to the University,
and we want those funds to be
put toward a gargoyle.”

They added that while at
Sewickley Academy, a private
high school the pair attended,
they managed to get a gargoyle
placed onto the school’s roof
after promising it to the student
body.
At least three SGB mem-
bers, Christa Douaihy, Dave
Eisenberg and Marquette
Bowman, witnessed the event
in front of the Union.

Douaihy called the police

dates. A Pitt Police officer

GAMMAGE

did so and Brentwood didn’t like that”,
On Oct. 12, 1995, Jonny Gammage
was found dead after he had been hand-
cuffed and laid on his chest on the side of
the road after being pulled over by
Brentwood police officers for speeding.
Activists say he died as a result of police

‘brutality from ﬁve policemen.

Whitehall Sergeant Keith Henderson
was granted immunity to testify, and
Whitehall ofﬁcer Shawn Patterson was
never charged. Brentwood Lieutenant
Milton Mulholland and Baldwin borough
patrolman Michael Albert will be retried.
Brentwood officer John Vojtas was

» acquitted.

A turnout of approximately 50 peo-
ple and a handfull of TV stations and
newspapers showed up Sunday evening
for a “Justice for Jonny Gammage” rally
in the Union’s Kurtzman Room. The rally
was packed with emotional speakers
from local organizations and included a
speech by Babish.

Babish, the keynote speaker due to
his recent lawsuit against the borough of
Brentwood for his firing, spoke to the
crowd about the status of Brentwood’s
police department.

“When I was hired as police chief of
Brentwood [in 1994], I was told they
wanted someone to come in and disci-
pline the police officers,” he said. “The
community of Brentwood did not want
an outsider, though. They didn’t want
Wayne Babish as their police chief.”

He explained that soon after taking
his new position, he began rewriting the
policies manual for the officers. Babish
said the officers didn’t like this, especial-
ly once he started taking serious discipli-
nary action against policemen who didn’t
comply with the manual.

In response, Babish said many of the
officers began recruiting people to run for
public ofﬁce who would ﬁre him, even

though this is a federal offense. M ,

 

Tim Stevens talks about injustice as Wayne Babish and Carolyn Mitchell listen.

FROM PAGE 1

There are some Brentwood police-
men who genuinely wanted to do an
admirable job, Babish added, but they
were outweighed by the bad ones.

‘“There’s a hardened group of them,”
he said, “whose darkest days are ahead of
them.”

He concluded his segment of the
rally by urging the members of the audi-
ence to continue paying attention to how
the Jonny Gammage issue unravels.

“Without your continuing concern,”
Babish said before stepping down from
the podium, “this case would have been
swept under the rug like so many before.”

After ,Babish’s lawyer spoke for a
few minutes, Tim Stevens, president of
the Pittsburgh chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, got up to speak.

“Tum around and look at your neigh-
bors,” he told the crowd. “What do you
notice about this audience?”

“It’s a mixed crowd,” one person
answered aloud.

“Doesn’t look like Brentwood,”
Babish added.

Stevens took these answers and
pointed out that the misjustice in the
Gammage case was so severe that people
are coming together across racial lines to
bring federal intervention in thecase of
the police officers. -

He added that everyone has a role to
play in the case.

“We need protests week after week. .

We need to keep sending letters. There’s
certain things new groups can do that old
ones _can’t. There’s things the NAACP
can do that new groups can’t,” he said,
with a raised voice and waving 
“We need to utilize each other for what
we have and respect our differences.
“Never forget we do have the
power,” he added. “They are sensitive to
heat. It’s no accident this case is coming

back to Allegheny County.”

ing laugh, he continued, “No, but really, I
just enjoy the whole radio thing. I enjoy an
appreciation for the art.”

The students who run the station say it

gives hands—on broadcast experience in a .

“working classroom.”

These are collective beliefs held by a
group of deejays, music programmers and
engineers who work to bring a_ hearty mix

of music, ranging from indie rock to rap to 2

world music, to students living in Schenley
Quad, Lothrop Hall and, on a good day, the
Towers.

“We are trying to play music that is
really good and that is difficult to ﬁn ,”
said Connelly, who is ﬁnishing his last year
of study in electrical engineering. “A lot of
times tuning into the radio station is the
only way students can ﬁnd out about a type
of music they like but never heard before.”

“At the same time, the main responsi-
bility is to give students a way to gain
experience in broadcasting,” he added.

And students are taking advantage of
the radio setting to do just that. ’

For Marc Miller, a Pitt sophomore,
deejaying was already a part of his life
before coming to the University. Working
for a deejay company in his hometown of
Philadelphia throughout high school, he
entertained guests at weddings, parties and
bar mitzvahs.

While watching ﬁve-year—olds ener-
getically dance to music alongside elderly
couples swirling across the ballroom dance
ﬂoor, Miller decided he wanted to contin-
ue deejaying while attending school.

“I’ve always enjoyed deejaying and I
knew I wanted to do some type of deejay-
ing out here,” he explained. “I couldn’t
pursue party entertainment because I didn’t
have a car or the equipment, so I thought
about WPTS.”

Now into his first semester as a deejay,
Miller is learning what it takes to be in the
radio business.

“It gets kinda lonely because there is
no one listening in the moming,” he said,
referring to his 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. time slot
on Tuesday.

“Most of my friends can’t listen
because they’ve got class. V I’ve gotten
about one call in four shows, but it’s a great
start. I’m not sure yet, but I can see myself
doing something like this in the future.”

But because Miller is so wrapped up in
making sure that all the WPTS procedures
are being followed while taping the shows
for his parents back home, he doesn’t have
time to think about being alone at the sta-

tion.

It also doesn’t hurt that he constantly
has a positive outlook on things and an
inherent love for deejaying.

“Honestly, it is just a lot of fim to do,”
he said with a grin. “To be in control of
what people are hearing, that’s pretty
coo .” .

Getting students excited about enter-
ing broadcast radio was one of the under-
lying reasons behind Pitt’s decision to sup-
port the addition of a campus station.

The history of WPTS 92.1 FM traces
its roots back to the Fall term of 1957,
when 12 students formed the Student
Broadcasting Association with the intent of
starting a college radio station to serve Pitt
students. '

Led by Adrian Cronauer, whose expe-
riences in Vietnam are the basis of the
movie Good Morning Vietnam, WPGH, an
AM carrier-current station which broad-
cast to the Union and the student domis,
was born.

The push to get an FM station began in
the fall of 1977, when WPGH and Pitt’s
Student Government Board got together to
plan for the switch. After seven years of

working closely with the Federal
Communications Commission, WPGH
became WPTS and entered the Pittsburgh
FM market on August 26, 1984. _

As a formatted college radio station,
WPTS uses a rotation schedule weekdays
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. where deejays are
requested to play a certain song lineup. On
weeknights and weekends, students can
tune in to a variety of specialty shows that
meet their music interests.

In doing this, Connelly said, WPTS
allows student deejays to see how a pro-
fessional radio station operates.

While new deejays like Miller are
often thrown into the rotation schedule to
get them acquainted with the equipment
and new styles of music, veteran deejays,
like urban music, director Chris Banks,
often have their own specialty shows.

“With specialty shows the deejay gets
to decide the type of music they want to
play,” Banks said. “I play R &B, but we’ve
got people who play house, metal, ska,
jazz, reggae, jungle, techno. We have cer-
tain listeners that we know. [Specialty
shows] gather a lot of interest.”

For Pitt junior Gary Boeh, who plays

underground heavy metal during his two
hours on the air, specialty shows offer a
feeling of being in complete control.

“I pretty much go in there and play
something when I feel like it,” he said. “I
play the stuff that I think people should
hear.”

Continuing with WPTS tradition by
running his metal show on Sunday after-
noons, Boeh has a group of listeners who
call in every Sunday requesting songs.

“I like when people call because I
know people are out there listening,” said
Boeh. “Some say that more students would
listen if we played Top 40 radio, but you
can get that anywhere. I am one of the only
shows around that offers black or death
me .”

“You have to have an open mind to
work here,” Gasowski said. “We bring a
new and different sound to the airwaves
and you have to be willing to experience
new music. If it wasn’t for radio stations
like this one, bands like R.E.M., U2 and,
currently, Pavement, who were staples of
college radio may not have hit it big.
People should listen in, they just may hear
something really coo .” t

arrived almost ﬁve minutes later and
asked Hudac and Gielata to climb down‘.

Gielata asked the officer to give him
two minutes to ﬁnish the speech. But
minutes later the officer climbed on to the
roof to escort the pair down.

Hudac said the officer was not angry,
and even said he would vote for them if he
could.

“He also repeated many times that
this was a stupid thing to do,” said Hudac.
“But he was very nice about it.” ‘

Douaihy said she called the police
because she thought it was illegal to be on
the roof. She said Hudac and Gielata were
“making fun of the SG .”

“Christa probably thinks we’re
threatening her position as ‘the rebel,’”
Gielata said.

Other SGB members said they did
not take seriously the actions of the gar-
goyle slate.

While watching the events unfold,
Eisenberg told an on-looker that the pair
were “two jokers.”

tion was since I don’t know him too well,”
said Hudac. He said Board member

Gargoyle party sets I
good example for
SGB candidates

' Damon Hudac and Joe Gielata stood perched atop the
portico between the Wrlliarn Pitt Union and McCormick Hall,
like a couple of gargoyles, calling out their message to the stu-
dents of Pitt

It is time that all the candidates for Student Government
Board make themselves as visible to the student body.

As election time approaches, candidates will ﬁnd them-
selves, for maybe the ﬁrst time ever, having to deal with issues.

For many years, the election process has been, for the
most part, a farce. Issues have been moot points as voting out-
comes have depended on who belonged to the larger fraterni-

ty.

But thanks to the mockery that this SGB has made of itself
in the past year, students may ﬁnally be outraged enough to
care about who controls their allocations dollars.

Candidates will have to campaign for real this time. .

Last year, Marquette Bowman started doing things right
He called a town hall meeting before the election in an effort
to reach the students who cared. He also got elected

Hudac and Gielata have begun a similar campaign this
year, albeit a less conventional one. If other candidates want to
compete, they should start making themselves visible, too.

Not every candidate has to employ such rock—’n’—roH
band-like publicity tactics as Hudac and Gielata, but it is
imperative that candidates get themselves into the public eye

- and start grappling with issues.

Last year, Justin DalMolin won the presidency with a
mere three votes more than his opponent Marc Friedberg

received Every vote makes a difference.

Candidates: Start calling town hall meetings, printing ﬂy-
ers and proclaiming your campaign platforms to the whole
student community. You’re not doing enough if it’s less than
most Homecoming candidates did.

Hopefully, well organized campaigning will lead to a
SGB with a much more professional attitude toward their
positions. a

The attitude our current board has taken over the past year
is appalling; a “We’re elected, now ‘Screw them all!’” kind of
attitude pervades every public activity this board has engaged
in recently. A

They recently told SGB hopefuls that they were the best
board ever in the history of Pitt, and that nobody will be bet-
ter.

That is absolutely ridiculous.

Probably any board that could be elected this year will be
better than the current one. After all, how good can a board be

when its members feel personally insulted by Hudac and

Gie1ata’s campaigning and call the police to arrest them?

OPINIONS

Michael

Damico

For many students, moving
away to college is the first real
experience of being out on our
own. Sure, Mom was there when
we needed someone to wake us
up in the morning, someone to
borrow $10 from, or someone to
take to the senior prom, "but the
days of treating your mother no
better than the average automaton
are sadly over. Now it’s time to

grab the reigns of responsibility’
for nearly every aspect of our-

lives. It certainly seems daunting
at first, but luckily there is help
available here atthe University
for some of the more difficult
tasks such as ﬁnding a job, sched-
uling classes and washing our
hands. ,
Hand washing, you ask?
Well, dear reader, just putthis arti-
cle down, head into the nearest
public rest room and see for your-
self. Ifthe soap dispensers are like
many of the ones found across the
campus, the front of the dispenser
contains a fascinatingly useless
bit of information: directions for

_ washing one’s hands.

This whole thing is more than
a bit puzzling to me. Is this really
that difficult of a task? I would
hope that most of the students -and
faculty members of a university
are quite aware of the ﬁner points
of personal hygiene’s most basic
task.

Not conﬁdent that their
instructions have made every-
thing perfectly clear, though, they
have also printed’ the friendly
reminder that hand soap is for
“extemal use only.” Has this real-

The Pitt News

1y been a problem in the past?
Before this little warning was put
into place, had the ingestion of
soap been a big source of money
loss for the multirnillion-dollar
soap manufacturer? It would
seem to me that if, after lathering
up, people topped off their ice-
cream sundaes or put a dollop into
their coffee, Calgon would be uti-
lizing a part of the market that it
had never before even considered.

Well, perhaps this particular
point is explainable. Maybe some
overzealous parent forced their
foul-mouthed little imp of a child
to wash his or her mouth out with
the soap, and the subsequent
abdominal pains and violent
vomiting of suds inspired them to
call their lawyer. Okay, so the
warning against eating the soap
could just be a legal precaution.
That I could understand — sort
of.

I carmot, however, come up
with a reasonable explanation for
the fact that the dispensers tell us
that this particular soap is for
“professional use only.” Are they

“Look, We’ve really got to
cover out butts on this one. We
can’t have amateur hand washers
using this stuff. It’s far too dan-
gerous. We’ve got to leave this to
the experts!”

’ If this stuff is intended for
professionals only, why do they
need to provide instructions on
how to use it? If these so—called
“professionals” need this sort of
assistance, I seriously have to
question their qualiﬁcations.

' don’t believe that Calgon has pro-

vided us with a ‘solution. Studies
have shown that many people do
not wash their hands after using

ing why people don’t wash up.

If this study were to be car-

Clinton sets the standard for what the president should not be

Carrie
Hager

It amazes me that our current pres-
ident, Bill Clinton, has managed to get
himself elected twice, despite his being
totally untrustworthy and the numerous
scandals in which he has been
involved. _

To me, trustworthiness is of upmost

e importance for the president to possess,

and I thought that most Americans
shared my‘ sentiments on this issue. But
apparently I was wrong, because last
November, millions of Americans
voted to re-elect a man who had proved
in his ﬁrst term that he couldn’t be
trusted. Personally, I trust Clinton about
as far as I could throw him, and that’s
not just because he is a liberal who goes
against much of what I believe.

Last November, I talked to many
people who said they didn’t trust
Clinton, but they didn’t want to vote for
Bob Dole because he was old. I don’t
understand this logic. How can youth
be more important than trustworthiness
in something as critical as deciding
who is going to run our country? Sure,
Bob Dole was older and wasn’t a hand-
some man like many women seem to
think Clinton is. But more importantly,
Dole was respectable, trustworthy and
he didn’t dodge the draft like Clinton
did. (Bob Dole won the Purple Heart
for being wounded in combat.)

Bob Dole showed us integrity.

I did my best to recruit Dole voters,
and reached many people, but I guess I
didn’t reach enough.

Well, at least farther down the road,
when Clinton is indicted, I can proudly
say that I didn’t elect such a man for
president.

Military service is one of the most
honorable things you can do for your
country. JFK, loved by many, once said
“It’s not what your country can do for
you, but what you can do for your
country.” Our country was based on
beliefs, such as this. If you don’t love
your country enough to fight for it and
help preserve our liberty and freedom,
how can you be fit to run the country,
let alone make military decisions about

— which you would know nothing? I am

ashamed to have a man run our county
who wouldn’t even fight for it. Clinton
wasn’t the only man to dodge the draft
—-— there were thousands —-— but he is the
only one to ever attain such a position
of authority.

The‘ name Clinton and illegal cam-
paign contributions have by now
become synonymous. It is illegal to
solicit campaign funds onfederal prop-
erty, which has recently been an issue
with the newly discovered “coffee
meetings” videotapes.

For those of you who don’t watch
the news, Clinton is under investigation
because he had certain Democratic
campaign contributors come for coffee
meetings at the Oval Office. One such
visitor is shown on a tape bragging
about the number of checks he had for
the’ president.

These checks were made out to the
Democratic National Committee,
which very directly supported Clinton’s

‘Huang and Charlie

re-election campaign. Press reports
have also revealed that more than 100
such coffee meetings occurred, and that
$27 million in contributions were
secured.

Illegal campaign contributions
seem to be a favorite of Clinton’s. He
has also received ille-
gal campaign contri-
butions from John

Trie, as well as many
others who trans-
ferred funds from the
Bank of China to the
Democratic commit-
tee. Press reports
have also revealed
that Clinton invited
hundreds of guests to
stay in the Lincoln
Bedroom in exchange
for a contribution.
Someone who bla-
tantly defies federal
law in order to raise campaign funds
definitely should not be running our
country. '

Whitewater is probably the best-
known scandal Clinton has been
involved in. Many people close to him,
including his Whitewater partner, have
been indicted. Bill and Hillary have not
been indicted yet, but it is only a matter
of time before they will follow the oth-
ers.

You see, the question of whether a
current president can be indicted for
crimes that took place before being
president has not been answered yet.

But sometime in the not—too-distant

‘future, Bill and Hillary will follow the

others straight to jail.

The Paula Jones case is just anoth-
er in a long line to join the-cloud of
scandals circling the White House.

Out of respect for the presidency,
although Clinton
 doesn’t deserve any, I
feel I should say
something positive
about him. I will
admit that he is a
good speaker. By this
I mean that he sounds
good when he’s
speaking, if you’re
content to take him
on a purely superﬁ-
cial level. But most of
the time, what he says
is either a bunch of
nothing, or is an idea
that isn’t really good

ple. Yet he must be a good speaker,
because he continues to get away with
It.

Well, I could write a book about all
the things Clinton has done wrong, but
unfortunately, I couldn’t fit it all into
this column. The bottom line is this:

.Clinton has been in far too many scan-. V I

dals to be allowed to run our country.
He had better watch out, because hope-
fully, an impeachment is in his future.

Carrie Hager is a sophomore who dis-
likes Hillary Clinton even more than
she dislikes her husband.

Coming Out Week
tactics did not involve
physical assaults

Alison Novicki wrote a column
expressing her opinion that the tactics
used last week during the National
Coming Out Week were too strong. She
claimed that employing ‘these tactics
(writing in chalk) was “defacing
University property.”

She also said these slogans, which
encourage people to think about gay
rights and recognize that many students
and faculty here are gay, are threatening
to homophobes. I

I’m sorry, are homophobics beaten
and discriminated against as a matter of
routine society? ‘ -

She claims that the “perpetrators”
are defeating their purpose by being con-
frontational. If this is so, then perhaps the
slaves and abolitionists of the Civil War
should not have fought for the rights of
Africans to live as citizens and not slaves
in this country. Perhaps women should
have patiently continued to “ask” for

_ their right to vote, a tactic she perhaps

)>>>

finds more agreeable. She claims that for
both of these groups, struggles for rights
were taken in “baby steps.” Actually,
both were highly visible and often pas-
sionate fights going on while both
women, abolitionists, and slaves were
trying inform and educate the racists and
sexists that they encountered daily.
Chalk drawings on a sidewalk,
where one can either think about the
issues or walk away in agreement or not,
is not exactly a highly confrontational
style of exposure to an issue. Civil war,
petitioning, picketing, and demonstra-
tions are. Perhaps, then, unions and strik-
ers should just quietly discuss their
issues in private so as not to disturb any-
one or raise consciousness about any-
thing outside of anyone’s realm of expe-
rience.

Nixon just helped
us to mature as  
citizens & voters

Michael Berquist apparently
views America’s lately reawakened
distrust of government as some sort
of “handicap.” I

This lack of trust is no more a
“handicap” than the discovery that
the fellow who eats the cookies and
milk on Christmas Eve also kisses
one’s mother. It’s just a part of grow-
ing up, of understanding how the
world works.

Millions of Americans now
understand that the process of elec-

tion does not magically transmute ~

ordinary human beings with ordinary

human foibles into wise and noble
Guardians of the Public Trust. They
understand that government officials,
regardless of their political affilia-
tion, seek their own self-interest, and
unlike ordinary citizens, can rein-
force their whims, however foolish,
with enormous financial and military
power.

Nixon left a valuable legacy — a

growing group of people who under-

stand, with George Washington, that
“Government is not eloquence; gov-
ernment is not Reason; government is
Force —— like fire, a dangerous ser—.
vant” to be watched over and con-
trolled, lest it harm us.

There are now watchful people
from all parts of the political spec-
trum — Republicans and Democrats
and Reformers and Libertarians —

who believe that “We the People” I
agents‘ .
behave as our masters, rather than our -

suffer when government
servants; who believe that “We the
People” must somehow work out
solutions to the recurring problem of

rampant government power.

Rute will
face pounding
in Piscataway

Pitt Panther Bowl Quest 1997,
recovering from two straight crashes,
makes its next stop in -Piscataway,
N.J., this weekend.

The Panthers will battle the
Scarlet Knights of Rutgers, who are
coming off of a heartbreaking 37-35
loss to Army, who won a national
championship as recently as 1945.

Rutgers is 0-7. They have been
outscored 192-43 in Big East
matchups so far. They are the worst
team the conference has to offer.

Pitt should beat them. But beating ’

them isn’t enough.

Fans, it’s time for an old-fash-
ioned blowout.

After losses to ex—conference
doormat Temple and ex-national
laughingstock N otre Dame, it’s time to
get back on the Liberty Bowl band-
wagon with the largest margin of vic-
tory possible.

Momentum is key. A 14-, 2- or 28-
point win against a bad team isn’t
going to provide the swing in conﬁ-
dence that the Panthers will need to
tear up their conference schedule in
the next few weeks.

For an example, look north. The
Syracuse ‘Orangemen started the sea-
son strong before falling ﬂat with‘
three losses. Talk of a bowl berth was
dismissed almost immediately.

Then, a funny thing happened —
Syracuse played Rutgers.

Donovan McNabb passed (and
optioned) his team to 50 points, and
the Orange defense held the Scarlet
Knights to just a ﬁeld goal. Syracuse
went back over the .500 mark, and
regained its long-lost respectability.

The next week, the Orange mauled ~

Temple, 60-7.

Now that’s conference momentum
— something Pitt will need in abun-
dance if there is any chance for the
Panthers to make it to the promised
land of Memphis on New Year’s Eve.

The Panthers have the weapons
for such a momentum-building
blowout. Pete Gonzalez, while not to
be confused with Donovan McNabb,
has shown exceptional arm strength as
well as a tendency to duck his shoul-
der and run to daylight at very oppor-
tune moments. His primary target ——
wideout Terry Murphy —— has proved
his ability to burn just about anybody,

keep their heads above water
this weekend, as they split a pair

Loss to Vulcans drops Pitt Rugbyto 0-6

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s rugby club lost its
sixth game in a row last weekend,
dropping the team to 0-6 on the sea-
son. The Panthers lost a tough game to
California University of Pennsylvania,
20-10.

On a more successful note, the
club’s “B” team — made up mostly of
younger and more inexperienced play-
ers — won its fourth game of the year,
10-7, over the Vulcans’ second team.
This improves the “B” team’s record to
4-2, which bodes well for the
Panthers’ future. V

In the big game of the day,
Califomia’s “A” squad led off with a
penalty kick early in the game, giving
the team a 3-0 lead.

California took a 10-0 lead
moments later, capitalizing on what
Pitt club President Dave ‘Misiolek
called a “ﬂat” opening for the
Panthers. Cal stomped into the try
zone after Pittsburgh missed’ a tackle
that could have stopped the Vulcans’
momentum and scoring drive. Cal then
began running away with the game.

“We played well as a team, we just E

made many mental mistakes,” said
Head Coach Dan Talbert.

Alan Bunteman was able to
answer for Pitt minutes later with a try
of his own. He drove in from only a
few -yards out and touched the ball
down to make the score 10-5. It would
have been even closer, but the Panthers
missed the two-point conversion play,
keeping the deﬁcit at ﬁve.

Just as Pittsburgh seemed to be
getting back into the game, the
Vulcans put it out of reach with anoth-
er try. But like the Panthers, they
missed their conversion.

Cory Rosensteel responded for the
Panthers with the squad’s second try of
the day, as a result of a penalty. But
with a chance to pull within three, Pitt
again missed the conversion, leaving
the score 15-10.

Pitt would not get on the board
again. The Vulcans pounded in one
more try but missed a conversion, cap-
ping the ﬁnal score at 20-10.

“I don’t have much to say about
the ‘A’ side,” Talbert said after the
game.

The team has not scored much this
year and has not been competitive in
the closing minutes of any contest this

season.’

“We played well, but we just
aren’t ﬁnishing,” Misiolek said.

The Panthers have scored a total of
ﬁve tries in their six games this season.
To become effective, a team needs to
score more often than this, according
to the coaching staff.

“We just haven’t found a way to
score,” Misiolek noted. p

With the team’s fall campaign
already doomed to a sub-.500 ﬁnish,
the squad needs to get its season back
on track and then look forward to the
spring season.

According‘ to the club’s ofﬁcials,
the Panthers have up to two games
remaining.

The match is not yet conﬁrmed,
but the club may travel to the

. University of Pennsylvania this week-

end.

If Pitt does venture to
Philadelphia, the Panthers should
return with their first win, because
they defeated the Quakers 72-0 last
year.

After this matchup, the Panthers
play Carnegie Mellon on Saturday,
Nov. 1, to complete their league sched-
ule. -

It was a perfect day for cross coun-

The men ﬁnished second among

placed fourth in a 13-tearn ﬁeld with 91
points and were just ﬁve points away
from second place. Carnegie Mellon
won the women’s race fairly easily with

3 42 points.

 

All of Pitt’s women had season-best

early in the race, when she twisted her
ankle about one-third of the _ way
through the course.

up most of the lost ground

“Cross country isn’t like other
sports. You can’t call time out and put in
a substitute,” said Pitt Head Coach Dave
Sobal. “Fortunately, she was able to
keep going.”

Francy ended up with a time of

V 18:34—herbest time ofthe season by
’ nearly a full minute. She ﬁnished in

sixth place.

Lynda Andros was Pitt’s next run-
ner, in 13th place with a time of 19:00 -

Perhaps the most important result
of the day for the men is that they beat
cross-town rival Duquesne for the ﬁrst
time in four attempts this season. In fact,
the Panthers won this battle pretty hand-
ily. Duquesne came in sixth place with

Hoops’ first open practice

Zachariah Blott

News Editor
. Pitt’s men’s basketball team kicked off its
1997-98 season on Saturday, Oct. 18, with its
ﬁrst open-to-the-media practice of the year.

One thing is for sure — the players are
young.

For starters, there are six freshmen recruits
new to the team. In addition, the squad consists
of another freshman, three sophomores, two
juniors and one senior, for 13 players total. Only
10 are scholarship players.

The six freshmen displayed a plethora of
skills to the 15 or so people who were on hand
at the Fitzgerald Field House to see what this
group of newcomers could do. The following
are what Pitt fans learned about the freshmen
after watching the two-hour practice:

Atilla Cosby: The most highly touted recruit
this year, Cosby is a 6—foot—9 center/forward
who  outstanding athleticism to the team.
He runs the ﬂoor like a deer, is extremely quick
inside and is an explosive leaper. He shoots well
out to 15 feet and goes to the basket with conﬁ-

_ dence. Also, he’s an aggressive defender who is

diﬁicult to get around or shoot over.
Ricardo Greer: This 6-foo_t—5, 225-pound

recruit. His large ﬁame is pure muscle, and he
usesittodomostofhis darnagenearthebasket.
He jumps extremely well and has moves that are
tough for anyone to stop: He’s too big for a
guard to handle and too fast for"most forwards to
contain He plays both defense and olfense with
conﬁdence usually found in a veteran.

Stephen I1ores: Flores is a 6-foot—8, 200-
pound forward with tmconventional skills for a
man his size. His shooting range isn’t limited to
the inside of the three-point arc, and his passing
skills are great; in fact, he averaged six assists a
game his senior year in high school. Also, he
dribbles well both on the perimeter and under
the basket. Flores is a little slow on the rim but
has quick ﬁrst-step moves, so expect him to use
these to open up spacefor himself, which he
can’t do using his strength. I

guardappearstobethemosttalentednew’

John Finneman: Large for a guard, Finneman
stands 6 feet 6 inches, with 190 pounds on his
lean frame. He isn’t too fast, but that’s not his
style. Instead, Finneman is a three-point spe-
cialist. He can drain it from about anywhere,

and his shot is too fast for many _defenders to

stop.

Michael Shin: At 6-foot—8 and 230 pounds,
he’s here for one reason — to be a strong inside
player. He goes to the hoop strongly and
rebounds well. Having not been highly recruit-
ed out of high school, Shin will need to become
more tenacious on both sides of the court to
keep up with the big men of Georgetown and
Connecticut

Kevin Leslie: Even larger than Shin, the 6-
foot—8, 250-pound Leslie is capable of getting
inside for rebounds. Also, he goes to the hoop
strongly when he wants to. One problem he’ll
have is foul trouble. His lack of speed and occa-

sional overaggressive play will get him in trou- .
. ble with the refs.

Junior Vonteego Cummings still has all the

» skills that vaulted this 6-foot—4 point guard onto

the national scene last year". a great shot, unstop-
pable moves, good passing, and brilliant
defense.

Standing six feet tall, sophomore guard
Kellii Taylor still has lightning-quick cuts but
will need to become a better passer to play point
guard at times.

Sophomore guard Jarrett Lockhart (6-
foot—2) was used sparsely last year, but seems
to realize that he’s now in a position of leader-
ship as one of only -four returning players. He’s
talking more and playing aggressively. A

Forward Isaac Hawkins (6-foot—8, 210
pounds) is also a sophomore who will see a lot
more playing time this year. He too understands
what his new role will be and is playing both
ends of the ﬂoor well. He’s getting a lot of
rebounds with his athleticism and a frame that
is slightly bigger than last season.

In addition, walk-on guards Chris Gardella
(a 5-foot—7 senior), Chris Home (a 6-foot—4

junior) and Andrew Shogunn (a 6-foot—4 fresh-
man) will provide some depth in the back court.

digs. Kim Branarn added 16 kills and Lyndsay
Spresser chipped in with 15. Kim Schaper
notched a match-high 60 assists for the Lady
“Akron did a lot of things well in our
match,”Alvear commented. “They had a certain
playset that used a left-handed player very well,
and we were not able to stop it.”

"Pittsburgh rebounded Saturday afternoon
defeating Youngstown State, 15-10, 15-11 and
15-8.

The Lady Panthers were led by Thiesen
and Zemrowski’s eight kills apiece. Thiesen
added 13 digs, one assist and one block.

 Junior Jessica Van Der Mallie opened the

A third game with five  

mom PAGE 8

including one ace. Meinhart led Pitt with ﬁve
blocks in the win.

“I really don’t think we played well
Saturday, but we’ve become comfortable play-
ing away,” Alvear added “As a team, we’ve
had the discussion that we need to go out and
win every match to get into the postseason con-
ference tournament.”

Pittsburgh will face West Virginia Friday
and Kent State Sunday before retuming to the
Fitzgerald Field House for a pair of conference
matches against Providence and ‘Boston
College on Nov. 1: and 2. The Panthers then
round outtheir season with a four-game road

COLUMN

and would be a perfect target for three
or four long touchdown bombs in the
first quarter or two.

Dwayne Schulters is fast enough
to break the long runs necessary to put
points on the board in a hurry.
Freshman Kevan Barlow, if he can
hold on to the football, will be eager to
make an impact against a suspect
(heck, guilty) Rutgers defense.

Pitt’s line is healthy. Kirk
McMullen is ready to show the coach-

FROM PAGE 8

ing staff that he deserves the tight-end 4

spot on his own merit, and not just
because John Jones is switching to
defense. Jake Hoffart is still ready to
take bumps on short routes to get his
team out of tight spots.

This offense can score 60 points.
Against the Scarlet Knight defense,
there will be a chance to prove it.

The defense, of course, will have
to keep up. If Pitt scores 60 and
Rutgers scores 54, all talk of bowl
games disappears and Defensive
Coordinator Larry Coyer goes from
innovator of the Mad Dog to resident
of the Dog House.

Luckily, the defense has a person-
al stake in this one. After giving up 45
points to Notre Dame, Panther defend-
ers will be out to prove‘ that the sea-
son—long hype about their tenacious,
attack—the—ball-and-let-the-refs-sort-
them-out defense is justified.

Linebackers Phil Clarke and
Ernest Coakley, after being pounded
by Notre Dame’s large line, will see a
much smaller front this week. Instead
of chasing Autry Denson all over Pitt
Stadium, the Panther corps will
instead busy itself pursuing Jacki
Crooks, who rattled off an impressive
14 whole yards against the 1996 ver-
sion of the Pitt defense.

That defense, for those of you who
do not remember (or have blocked it
out thanks to months of intensive ther-
apy), gave up 72 points to Ohio State,
60 to Notre Dame, 55 to Syracuse, 53
to Temple (on Homecoming, for cryin‘
out loud), 45 to Miami, 42 to Houston
and 34 to both Virginia Tech and West
Virginia.

Oh, and nine to Rutgers. The last
time the Scarlet Knights were con-
fused with a high-octane offense, gas
cost 10 cents a gallon.

The opportunity is there. A big
win versus a weak conference foe will
put us at 2-] with a bullet in the Big
East. The momentum can carry the
Panthers through Boston College,
bringing the team back home in need
of just one more win to put a virtual
lock on a Liberty Bowl bid.

Then, of course, we have to beat
Syracuse.

Well, not all plans are perfect.
