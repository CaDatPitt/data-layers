To many in the University community. 1969 marked
the beginning of a new era. Although many felt the changes
instituted during 1969 were either too drastic or not drastic
enough, the changes did occur and the University is head-
ing in a new direction. Whether or not that direction is well
defined to the extent that the University will continue to
follow it will be determined in the years to come.

As a tribute to those dedicated people who brought
needed change to the University in 1969. The Pitt News of-
fers its readers a four page supplement, “the year past in
review." in which we have attempted to touch on the major
changes that occured during 1969. It is our hope that all
members of the University community. whether they
agree with the changes or not. will recognize the hard
work. dedication. and perserverance that made the
changes possible.

A Prayer For Racial Unity

-King Service

In commemoration of “me con-
tribution of Dr. Martin Luther
King,” Pastor Charles Carlson of
the Lutheran Student Center is
planning a brief service in Heinz
Chapel. tomorrow morning at 11.

Rev. Carlson stated that the
service will include favorite
hymns of the late Dr. King, lit-
tanies — one on hunger, readings,
and folk music.

Other University action has
been taken for Dr. King’s birth-
day.

Last week, Frank Carver, sec-
retary of the Board of Trustees,
announced cancellation of Univer-
sity classes. All offices will be
closed except those concerned
with “essential University func-
tions such as medical care, dor-
mitory, housing, and food. serv-
ices.” The library will have day
hours only. '

The Floating Black University
will host a program at 2 p.m. in
the SU Ballroom, with at least one
local speaker planned.

For the Heinz Chapel service,
two members of the University

City Ministry, Rev. Frank Horton \

and Rev. James Ray, will conduct
the service along with Rev. Carl-
son.

Rev. Carlson made a point of
emphasizing that the service
would be more than a memorial.
“We are celebrating the contri-
bution that the man made. King
was not interested in polariza-
tion, but was a causative for ac-
tion.”

Various national organizations,
both white and black, militant and
conservative, are joining their ef-
forts in commemorating the birth-
day of Dr. King. The United Press
International reports that the
Black Panther Party and the New
Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam have respond-
ed to a call for observance by the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.

(Editor's Note: This prayer, “A
Litany for Racial Unity,” was just
a part of the University's Heinz
Chapel Memorial services following
Martin Luther King’s assination on
April 8, I968.

(The eloquence of the excerpts
from the prayer honors the dream
of this great American.)

JUDGE US NOT for our self-
love, our rationalizations and lies

. in our relations with other men,

our perpetuation of social and psy-
chological ghettos in which to bar-
ricade ourselves from our broth-
ers, our maintenance of segrega-
tion as our national and religious
way of life,,and our too easy ac-
ceptance of cultural norms be-
cause we wish -to be popular, there-
fore becoming conformist in our
thoughts and actions.

We petition You to hear us, so
that Your Spirit will convert our
intention, and we may cease -be-
ing racial hypocrites and may
commit ourselves to the cause of
social justice which represents
the working of love in the sphere
of human life.

THAT YOU WILL teach us real-
ly to see one another, not in racial
categories or as strangers wear-
ing colored masks but as living and
human persons created by You in
Your very image. ‘

That You will endow us with
courage to fight against racial evil
in the spirit of non-violence and
love, making no peace with the op-
pression of this injustice.

That You will inform our minds
and enlighten our ignorance so
that we may do battle with evil in
all those specific social and eco-
nomic situations which limit an-
other person’s opportunities to
work, study, vote, live, cultivate
freedom, and pursue happiness.

THAT YOU WILL let us hear
the human hearts beating along-
side our own, and let others hear
the message of our own beating
hearts, so that we may communi-
cate with one another in a spirit of
compassion and naked mutual
need.

That You will show us how to
avoid empty smiles and polite
forms which perpetuate evasion of
truth and dishonest relationships.

That You will look with mercy
upon these who have been broken
in body, mind, or spirit as fighters
in the causeof racial integration
and human love; upon those who
haverbeen imprisoned or are now
in jails for this cause; upon tyred
in lynchings, murder, and humili-
ations; and upon those who have
been martyrs themselves.

  A Who’s The Enemy?

by MARK COHEN
CAS 1971

if “Twenty enemy soldiers were reported killed today in a battle
near Danang.” Everyday. the newspapers and radios and the liberal
television networks feed us this trash as truth.

Stop and think about it. Are the Viet Cong and the North Viet-
namese really your enemies? Are they trying to send you off to
kill or be killed for no other reason than that it is bad for the
national morale to lose a war?

If the “enemy" is the creature that is trying to kill the soldier.
then the soldier better know whom he has to defend his life against
and who his enemy really is. It seems clear that the enemy of the
U.S. soldier and all potential soldiers (you and I) is the system that
is willing to jeopardize not only our lives but the entire Vietnam-
ese people to establish a political colon_v.

The enemy of the Vietnamese people is Western imperialism.
First the French were driven out after ripping off the Vietnamese

_ economically and politically and now history is repeating itself with

you and me as part of the death machine that has been battled to a
stalemate by the spirit and struggles of the Vietnamese people.

Don’t be intimidated by the Agnew bullshit that we should
denounce the Hanoi endorsement of the moratorium. We should ac-

. cept with gratitude Hanoi‘s endorsement as a sign the Vietnamese

people recognize that some humanity exists in America and is strug-
gling against this cancer which is spreading its armies throughout
the world while it drains the natural resources of the globe for its
own greedy consumption.

The enemy of the Vietnamese is the enemy of the American
soldier and ourselves. It is the government which history books will
later state spoke for you and me. Although we know intellectually
and emotionally we are opposed to the war. reality tells us that the
Vietnamese people are still being massacred despite our uneasy con-
sciences. To effectively alter the course of history and avert the de-
struction of’ the Vietnamese people and the future victims of Ameri-
can militarism. we must attack the military institutions at all levels.

The university is a place to begin. Westinghouse Corporation
is represented on our Board of Trustees and has a large financial
interest in the university while it procures one of the largest De-
fense Department contracts in the country (around $133.000.000 last
year alone). Gulf Oil Corporation part of the Mellon Empire and
our university. was the inspiration of a C.I.A. staged coup d’tat when
Iraq attempted to nationalize its oil industry.

Much work needs to be done. We have seen the failure of the

S Moratorium to alter Nixon’s strategy in Vietnam. It is time we stop

being defensive and begin to -take the initiative in halting the devas-
tation reeked upon the world by the natural alliance of capitalism
and militarism. -

   

The Search

False Consciousness

by JEFF CASHER
Contributing Writer

When was it‘? It must have been
a few months ago—around August
—-I was reading some books by
Sartre. No. it was last night. yes.
last night that I was reading. Any-
way. that fellow Sartre really
messed me up—all his talk about
false consciousness. The idea
doesn't seem clear to me; what is
false consciousness‘? God. I wish
I could see it in somebody. may-
be that will help me. Sartre says
something -about lying to one-self.
about refusing to accept the re-
sponsibility for what one does.
But. I just got to see it. Oh. there's
my friend Mike. the pre-med stu-
dent. Maybe he knows somebody
with false consciousness. "Hey
Mike. do you know any—“

“Jeff. there you are. Sorry. I
can‘t talk now. Remember that
Biology test—the one I copied ev-
ery answer from Mary‘? Well. Pro-
fessor Plum wants to talk to me
about it. Do you know any good ex-

‘ cuses I can use‘? If I don‘t think of

one. he will probably flunk me. I
gotta get going. Oh. yeah can I
borrow your math homework to-
night‘? Thanks,I‘ll see you."

I don‘t know. Just one example
where I could actually see it in
somebody. Then I'll understand it.
Something else Sartre says-—he
believes that as long as we live in
a society based on falsehood and
inequity. any individual ethics is
at best a compromise. We have to
compromise our ethics. what does
that mean? Hey. there‘s my room-
mate Jack. Now. there's a guy
that would know. He thinks for
himseli'——no compromise for him.
“Jack. what's the matter?"

“REMEMBER that revolution-
ary new teaching method I was
telling you about. the one I was so
excited about. that finally I could
be myself in the classroom and
the students could also be people.
Remember I said that if I couldn't
teach that way. I wouldn‘t teach
at all‘? Well. the principal came
to my class today. He said the
school board wants me out unless
I teach like they want me to. I‘m
going to have to change back. Jeff.
I'll be home later. I've got to pre-
pare tomorrows boring. conven-
tional lesson. See you later."

Now. I‘m so confused. That Sar-
tre! Lying to oneself. compromis-
ing. not accepting ones own re-
sponsibility for what one does.

"Say. Freddy. whats the good
word?"

"Amnesty. they better give us
amnesty for that fire we set in the
student union last month. They
just better. If they don't. down
goes the Cathedral."

“WELL, GOOD luck. Freddy.
Bye.“ I‘m sure getting tired stand-
ing around like this. I don't think
anybody knows about this false
consciousness around here. But
Sartre says we all have it and that
we are not able not to have it. He
says that we are all slaves. and
not able not to be slaves. Our false
consciousness prevents us from
being free. One can never be free.
Never. I'm leaving—"Oops. sorry
Jim. I didn't see you. you were go-

ing so fast. Where are you going?" ‘

"Im going to celebrate. Re-
member that chick I knocked up
over the summer—she wanted me
to marry her and I told her to get
lost. I just heard the greatest
news.-My old man gave her a thou-
sand dollars yesterday. and she
is going to get an abortion. Now.
I‘m free. Did you hear that. baby.
I‘m free. free! "

Oh. my God.

Why Honor Dr. King?

by jerry gruebel
associate editor

"Pursuant to the action of the
University Senate of January 31.
1969. Thursday. Jan. 15. 1970.
will be observed as a University
holiday in honor of the: late Dr.
Martin Luther King. All Universi-
ty classes will be canceled. . 

I am wondering why. Why will
classes be canceled “in honor of
the late Dr. Martin Luther King"?
Nobody ever heard of him. No-
body ever thought enough about
what he talked about to live by it.

Pick up a newspaper. any news-
paper. I am remembering the
daily news: the war dead. the
draft calls. the racial riots. the

union strikes. the arms race. the
campus disruptions. The news is
about oppression. People make
the news‘.

YET, “IN honor of the late Dr.
Martin Luther King."
whom nobody believes in. classes
vsill be canceled. I am wondering
why i

Dr. King spoke before 2.000 per-
sons here at the University Nov.
4. 1966. At that time he foretold of
the violence that could and would
rock this country if something
was not done soon. Dr. King call-
ed. for a "massive action pro-
gram" to solve this problem.

The program was designed to
end blight in the slums. and to re-

/Oeop/ea 0’/"c//7”2f L /‘°s Ate/7

 

3 man.

lieve the economic conditions of
the Black people in the United
States. But there is still the Hill
District. and Harlem. and Phil-
adelphia‘s South Side. and Watts.
and Newark. The program never
took place.

THE VIOLENCE did. The op-
ression continued. Will oppression
ever end? The Eldridge Cleavers.
the H. Rap Browns. the Lester
Maddoxes. the George Wallaces—
what they stand for is much the
same thing.

So. classes will be canceled "in
honor of the late Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King." I guess because he
stood alone and devoted his life to
the ending of oppression and to his
dream. His dream that "one day
in the Red Hills of Georgia. sons
of former slaves and sons of for-
mer slave owners will sit down
together at the table of brother-
hood.“

But they say everyone can be
replaced. Someone else some day.
some where. will devote his life
to justice and futilely call for
"massive action programs“ to
solve a problem that won't be
solved.

AND I guess that-tomoi'row‘s
University holiday in observance
of the late Dr. King will be as
meaningless as George Washing-
ton‘s birthday. and Christmas
Day. and Easter. and Armistice
Day. and July 4. and Memorial
Day. and . . . . . .

How Our Readers See It

 

A Luxury Cadillac VS.

A VW Bus For Pigs

Editor. The Pitt News:

I am writing to express my out-
rage at the fact that the Universi-
ty is footing the bill for "Keeping
Up with the Posvars.“

I am refering to the University
purchase of a new $8.600 Cadillac.
when the old one needed only min-
or repairs.

Tuition is going up. disadvant-
aged students are having a hard-
er and harder time just getting by.
the hospital workers are getting
paid 1.75 an hour. and the Univer-
sity went out and spent almost $9.-
000 on a Cadillac. They talk of
youths values being screwed up‘?
What is wrong with a less inexpen-
sive car‘?

Students—don't let the admin-
istration pull any shit about it be-
longing to the University. Mr. and
Mrs. Jones (Posvarl have first
call and that's it! I believe that if
the Chancellor wanted to save the
University some bread he might
have used some of his influence.
But it is obvious that when it
comes down to the nitty gritty he
would rather pay low wages to the
University staff and have higher
tuition than get a less expensive
vehicle.

o'coi.uuovl_~§uAnus eta. mmm m U.S.A.

My answer to the problem is
this. If the honkies want a Cadil-
lac let them pay for it out of their
salaries and get a VW Bus that
can hold all the pig dignitaries.

By the way. I understand we
just missed on having the Univer-
sity buy a limosine for their folly.
That would have meant an addi-
tional sum of money and more lux-
ury for the haves.

Grade Rewards

Editor. The Pitt News:

My grades for the fall trimester
may be high enough to earn me a
place on the Dean‘s List. If they
are high enough. I ask that my
name not be placed on such a list.

I do not believe that letter
grades and the QPA are any re-
flection on learning. Often they
represent only a good memory
and the ability to guess what the
instructor wants. They can be det-
rimental to learning. as when stu-
dents choose easy. unchallenging
courses over more difficult but
more interesting courses because
the former will give them that
easy A or B.

Would it not be fairer in future
lotteries to use 12 fish bowls, one
for each month. and draw by a lot-
tery sequence one from each bowl,
so that after 48 capsules are drawn
the results would be four from each
month. and not an eight to ratio as
in the lottery just held‘? Minor ad-

justments could compensate for

unevenmonths and monthly birth
rates.

The same results may be accom-
plished by one fish bowl if the lot-
tery is listed in dozens. If the first
three dates drawn were all Sep-
tember. instead of being assigned
one. two. three. they would be as-
signed a dozen apart. that is one.
13. 25. If the next three selections
were December. June. December.
they would be assigned two. three.

dom sequence even if the fish bowl
were not thoroughly mixed.

I wish to voice my complete sup-
port for Dr. Obermair‘s article in
the Nov. 19 edition of The Pitt
News. The items demanded by the
Local 1199 are reasonable and
long overdue.

The Failure of the Draft Lottery

a monthly basis. The $100 per
week wage being sought by the
hospital workers would amount to
$433 per month. Most clerical. die-
tary. and custodial workers do not
make salaries on this level. '

According to the University's
Manual on Class Specifications
the minimum salary for any full-
time position is $256 per month
—a far cry from $433. The aver-
age wage for a food service work-
er is only $312 per month (again
from the University's Manual on
Class Specifications). The aver-
age wage for a domestic worker
is the same: so is the average wage
for clerical aides.

The University does not pro-
vide free hospitalization for its
employees. There is no procedure
for an employee to appeal griev-
ances. In short. employees of the
University. particularly non-pro-
fessional employees. are in the
same boat as the hospital em-
ployees.

We. as students. employees. and
faculty of the University. certain-
ly should use our influence for
change in the situation of the hos-
pital workers. and that of the Uni-
versity workers. as well.

Dear "Ambridge“:

I have received your letter

Convocation

To Encourage Dialogue

An important convocation will
be held in the Common Facilities
Building on Wednesday. Jan. 21.
beginning at 1 p.m. All members
of the University community are
strongly encouraged to partici-
pate.

Sponsored by the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences, the convocation
represents a significant innova-
tion. It has been designed to en-
able students, faculty members
and administrators to discuss
what is on their minds and engage
in a meaningful dialogue. In order
to promote active student partici-
pation in the convocation. the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences and the
Schools of Education and Nursing
have agreed to cancel all after-
noon classes for the day.

In a brief Pitt News interview.

Student Government President
Scott Baum emphasized that the
convocation is not intended to
“serve only for the discussion of
certain academic issues. Rather,
he declared, its purpose is broad-
er and hopefully will involve “peo-
ple bringing their own ideas and
doing what they please." The con-
vocation has been designed. Baum
continued. to be. "a total experi-
ence as opposed to an audience-
panel affair."

Although spontaneous desire
will reign at the convocation, sev-
eral discussion groups have al-
ready been slated. A panel consist-
ing of Dean Schneewind of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences, Dr.
Robert Colodny of the History De-
partment, Frank Donatelli, chair-
man of the University’s Young
Americans for Freedom chapter,
and Ellen Wartella will discuss
“General Education in the 70’s.”
Small groups will also be touching
on such topics as the language re-
quirement, the findings of the
Arts and Sciences Curriculum Re-
view Committee, and learning out-

As an added attraction. ampli-
fiers will be brought to the Com-
mon Facilities Building so that
groups can perform. Paints and

In short. the aim of the convoca-

Any individual or organization
interested in reserving space at
the convocation for a specific pur-
pose should contact Dr. Gilbert

Scott Baum‘s words. should "at
least come prepared to do what
they feel like doing.“

Engineering Judicial
Board Established

In the past. students have been
unjustly accused of one form or
another of cheating. but they have
had almost no way to appeal this
action.

A case of alleged cheating in the
School of Engineering revealed
that there was no operative insti-
tutional procedure or guide for the
handling of such cases. After dis-
cussion among various members
of the faculty and the Engineering
Student Cabinet. a student/facul-
ty committee of the school was
formed to consider the entire mat-
ter of academic integrity in the
School of Engineering. The com-
mittee also discussed policy for
the handling of alleged violations
of the rules and regulations of the
school relating to such matters.

Following thorough delibera-
tions, the committee proposed an
Engineering School Judicial
Board. Set up during the Fall
1969-70 term. the Judicial Board

is now ready to handle appropri-
ate cases.

Four students and three faculty
members, acting as justices, will
review cases before the board. In
addition, the board has two stu-
dent alternates and a non-voting
secretary.

The student justices have been
appointed by the cabinet while the
three faculty members have been
chosen by the dean of the School
of Engineering.

If a student would like his case
to be heard. he should bring it to
the attention of his department
chairman. who will then contact
the dean. The dean will inform the
Judicial Board of the case.

It. is also possible for a faculty
member to request a hearing if he
feels that he cannot make an equit-
able decision on the pending case
or is unsure of the proper penalty
to be imposed. »

After hearing a case and consi-
dering all possible evidence. the
board will make its judgment. This
judgment will in turn be enforced
by the dean. Penalties range from
failure of a single test to expulsion

“ from the University.

Although the student faculty
committee suggested an appendix
to the board‘s constitution entitled
“Standards of Academic Hones-
ty." specific rules and regulations
are left to the discretion of the
board.

‘ uate Council

In September 1968. out of a
total population of over 16.000
of Pittsburgh campus comprised
one per cent of it. but today.
January 14. it is estimated that
close to 600 total black students
are now attending the Univer-
sity.

It is also estimated that by
September of this year the black
student population should be
very near 1.000.

Most students feel that this
University is finally being awak-
ened. after years of sleeping or
overlooking the dilemma of the
black student. and has there-
fore undergone many radical
changes.

These changes were slow in
coming but have been primarily
the results of the establishment
of one of the most controversial
groups ever to appear on cam-
pus. Pitt’s Black Action Society
(BAS).

After the Pittsburgh racial
riots of the summer 1968 a new
fervor of black identity became
evident on campus. Black stu-
dents were more and more re-
jecting the traditionalism that
had patterned and governed
their lives before. and were en-
gulfed in the desire to do things
to help their own people instead
of only seeking to get a degree.
move to the suburgs. and give
cocktail parties. This new wave
of black thinking led to the
BAS's coming.

A groping for direction and
definition has marked curricular
change in the University over
the past year. Credit and distri-
bution quotas have been short-
ened. special studies programs
have broadened. and the Univer-
sity. propelled by student and
faculty activists. has been try-
ing to correlate its functions
with the needs of the community
that engulfs it.

The meaning of student re-
sponsibility has underlined an
existential debate surrounding
the need for majors, require-
ments. and the role of the teach-
er in the classroom. Philosophy
has been translated into specifics
in several areas.

The Degree

The rudiments of the under-
graduate degree have taken on a
new character in 1969. Instead
of 124. the student aiming for a
Liberal Arts degree must. now
complete only 120 credits. The
revision was.»-ta. direct result of
the discontinuation of the physi-
cal education requirements.

Distribution of studies require-
ments were whittled, from 15
credits accumulated’ equally
from the three adacemic areas
to nine. The language require-
ment may also be ready for the
axe.’  *

A standing» controversy for
the last eighteen years at the

University. the necessity for
mandatory completion of lan-
guage level four. bowed under

‘the pressure of the Undergrad-
(UC) during‘ the
summer.

At the present time. language
level one through four may be
satisfied by the S U (satisfactory-
unsatisfactory option) instead of
traditional grading procedures.

There is a series of alterna-
tives available to the student
entering level three and four;

‘the student may elect courses

dealing with cultural aspects.
offered in English or the for-

In January of 1969. the Uni-
versity administration was shock-
ed to find that the members of
the BAS had staged a protest for
action in the Cathedral and had
taken over its computer denter.

Fighting for self-determina-
tion and equality. the students
presented a list of demands to
the administration which includ-
ed; the recruitment of black
faculty. administrators. and other
personnel at all levels; space in
Hillman Library for a black
literature collection: the estab-
lishment of an Institute of Black
Studies in the University. a mea-
sure that black enrollment stead-
ily increase until black enroll-
ment composes at least 20 per-
cent of the University popula-
tion.

The demands have for the
most part been met. and black
involvement and education has
progressed at an almost unbe-
lievable rate when compared
with how it was before 1968.
and with other American Uni-
versities.

The BAS and some University
organizations have brought well-
known black speakers. such as
playwright. Leroi Jones; James
Farmer. former CORE director:
United Soul leader. Ron Kar-
anga. poet. Don L. Lee. exiled
South African leader. Gladstone
Ntlabati: and a host of others.

There is now a Black Studies
department. with black profes-

eign language. besides the con-
ventional literature courses.

Pass/Fail Out

The pass/fail system bit the
dust to make way for further im-
plementation of the S/U option.
Whereas in the past, only jun-
iors and seniors could elect
courses on a pail/fail basis, the
S/U system is open to all Uni-
versity students. One course
may be taken S/U per term, ex-
cept in the case where students
are enrolled in basic language
courses. In this instance, the stu-
dent can opt two coursesS/U.

Breaking down the traditional
grading system. an S substitutes
for A. B or C grades. while U
represents D and F. S and U do

not affect QPA calculations. but a

they do count
accumulation.

The grading procedures of the
past have ignited fires both phil-
osophically and academically at

the University over the last year..

A number of professors have
registered protest by giving blan-
ket A‘s and Bs to students en-
rolled in their courses; others
have initiated self—grading-meth-
ods. As yet. no revised all-Uni-
versity system has been adopt-
ed. but it is scheduled for fa-
culty debate during the-coming
term.

Relevance

Along with the relevance of
grading, the relevance of the
curriculum in general has come
under fire. A committee formed
last spring by the UC has fore-
run many of the changes that
have already been initiated and
that are predicted for the fu-
ture.

The College of Arts and Sci-
ences lteview Committee t.ASRC 2.
chaired by Dr. David Bram-
hali of lﬁlwziioinics. has sciioiisly
questioned Elie limitations of in-
the—classroom learning only.

dents feel is relevant education.

The black community is one
of the BAS‘s primary concerns
and it has many varied pro-
grams dealing and working in the
community. The University also
has several organizations dealing
with community problems and
there has been an effort by the
administration over the past year
to include the black community
completely in many aspects of
the campus. Along with the BAS's
many and varied community re-
lated programs. the University

curriculum

extracurricular activities. etc. are
on the line. Recent accreditation
of The Pitt News staff members
and special independent studies
projects involving on the scene
education point to an expansion
of the out-of-the-classroom-learn-
ing trend.

The University‘s limitations
have been suspended in another
area. as well. It is now possible
for a student to take courses at
Carnegie—Mellon. Duquesne. and
Chatham and receive University
credit.

Blacks

Getting away from the con-
fines of the University of Pitts-
burgh is a goal of the initiators
of the Black Studies programs.
Originally, a Black Paper for
Black Studies stressed the con-
cept of community involve-
ment in its non-conventional
spproach to black education.

The idea of a School of Black
Studies was rejected during the
summer by the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences Council (FASC l.
but a Black Studies Department
has survived.

In addition to the Black Stu-
dies Department. two programs

Along with location, the boun-
dary of time is in the process
of elimination. Instituted last
term, the I grade is now avail-
able to students who wish to
spend more than the allocated
15 weeks in a specific course
area. Independent study pro-
grams are often not subject to
one ‘term’s requirement, but may
extend over two or more terms

Intradepartmental Changes

Although intradepartmental ma-
jor requirements are considered
beyond the scope of an all-Uni-
versity dictum. the departments
themselves are moving toward
abolition of major requirements
that have proven themselves obso-
lete. The English department. as
an example. has removed all pre-
requisites for its majors.

Other departments are also
in the throes of reorganiz.ation.

To alleviate the problems of
students who cannot place them-
selves in the confines of any of
the extablished major programs.
the _University offers a self-de-
signed major -program. The red
tape involved has not dissuaded

Sexuality, etc.

New courses dealing with
subjects hitherto discussed among
friends but not anjoying formal
study were begun and the trend
is likely to continue. One such
subject is sexuality, now in a de-
partment all its own listed as

now being taught, as well.

The effort to make course
work “relevant" has run into a
problem of definition. Grades

houﬁng

 

Nineteen hundred and sixty-nine
marked the adoption of new social
rules for dormitory students, in-
cluding a self-regulatory curfew
system for upper class women,

extended visitation privileges,
and permission for alcohol con-
sumption in dorms for those of
legal age.

Fully operative judicial boards
for both men and women began
functioning in September, hearing
approximately 17 cases. Also in
September, the Nurses’ Residence
became a University dormitory.
Increased security measures, in-
cluding security doors operating
off room .keys in the Towers and
codified evacuation procedures
were put into effect in November.

A reorganization of the Hous-
ing Office occurred in June, with
John Vrana replacing Dave Ginne-
van as director of Housing. Other
new members of the staff include
Don Hughes, associate director of
Housing for Business Affairs;

Donna K. Smith, associate direc-
tor of Housing for Personnel; Will
Miller, program coordinator; and
Ron Cowell, assistant to the direc-
tor.

According to Donnasmith, the
head resident staff for 1969-70 is
the most educationally qualified
staff hired to date, with many
members doing doctoral work in
the student personnel field. The
current staff consists of Jean Bow-
ser, Holland Hall North; Karen
Bowen, Holland Hall South; Devra
Kimball, Amos Hall; Jeanne Ter-
rence, McCormick Hall and Car-
low College; Karen Derda, Brack-
enridge; Dave Ostrowski, Tower
A; Bob Redick, Tower B; Pat
Brown, Tower C; and Claudia Des-
wick, Nurses’ Residence.

New procedures for resident as-
sistant applicants, designed by
Donna Smith, were utilized in the
selection of the 91 1969-70 resi-
dent assistants. Applicants par-
ticipated in group interviews be-
cause RA’s often function in group
situations as well as on a one-to-

one basis. For the first time, sev-
eral juniors were selected for the
RA staff in response to the needs
of various groups of students. The
important criterion for all appli-
cants was the ability to relate to
groups of students.

Board was established and methi-

security doors in the Towers.

A proposal for a co-ed dormi-
tory (not an arrangement such as
in Tower C) was formulated and
may become workable in time for
fall housing plans.

morotorium

 

Anti-war sentiment at the Uni-
versity led to a great deal of in-
volvement, both of faculty and stu-
dents in the past year. Although
the main Moratorium activities
were held this fall, kickoff activ-
ities began last April. Good Fri-
day services were sponsored by
the Pittsburgh New University
Conference as part of the “April
Mobilization.”

As part of the program for May,
a rally was held at the University,
and on Saturday, the 24th, two to
three thousand people marched to
Point State Park for a “peace and
justice rally.”

Speakers at the rally included
the Rev. Charles Owen Rice and
Rennie Davis of the “Chicago con-
spiracy.” The day before the ral-
ly, a group named the “Citizens of
Pittsburgh Against War and In-
equality” protested in front of the
Duquesne Club. Ten of the dem-
onstrators were arrested; among
them were several University fac-
ulty members.

The campus was quiet during
the summer as far as the peace

movement was concerned, with
one notable exception. Chancellor
Wesley Posvar was elected to the
Board of Trustees of the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace.

The Moratorium

This fall, many students and
faculty became vocal in their op-
position to the war. and partici-
pated in the Moratorium Commit-
tee, and the New Mobilization
Committees offensive to end the
war. A series of programs—one
day long in October. two days in
November,‘ and three in December
were planned.

The first Moratorium. on Oct.
15, was aimed at gaining local sup-
port for the movement and was a
stepping stone for the November
“March on Washington.“ At the
University. many teachers can-
celled classes, allowing the stu-
dents to take part in the day-long
ceremonies.

The ceremonies began in the
morning with the planting of me-
moriai crosses. in commemora-

tion of the men who died in Viet-
nam. Folk and rock groups pro-
vided entertainment throughout
the day, playing between the many
speakers and demonstrations.

Among the speakers participat-
ing in the Cathedral lawn cere-
mony were Monsignor Charles
Owen Rice, Bouie Hayden, presi-
dent of United Movement for Pro-
gress, and Sidney Peck, associate
coordinator of the National Mobil-
ization Committee.

After the program at Pitt, stu-
dents from the University and
Carnegie-Mellon marched down
Fifth Ave., to meet with the rep-
resentatives of the other Pitts-
burgh colleges and rally at Mellon
Square.

An estimated 12 to 15,00 peo-
ple made it necessary for the ral-
ly to be moved to Point State Park.
Almost an hour after the first
marchers had entered the park,
the last were still walking through
town.

Police Involvement

For the great number of peo-
ple who were involved in the day‘s
activities. the Moratorium was a
victory for the peace movement.
but for others, it was not so peace-
ful. Several photographers were
stopped by members of the Tacti--
cal Police Force. and had their
film confiscated.

One Pitt News photographer
was physically assaulted by an of-
ficer. After the march had ended.
a University professor was ar-
rested by the TPF. and received
much the same type of treatment
as the photographer.

Nov. 13. 14 and 15 saw a great
many students bussing. driving.
or thumbing to Washington. D. C..
for the national Moratorium. The
“March Against Death." many
small seminars. and Saturda_v.s
mass march and rally at the
Washington Monument were the
ways that over a million people
expressed their dissatisfaction
witli the national policy concern-
tng Vietnam.

Richard Nixon refused to heed

the voiceof this vocal minority,"

and chose rather to follow a poli-
cy which he claimed represented
the “silent majority,” as he term-
ed the millions of Americans who
wouldn’t make their feelings
known. This outright denial, that
the two Moratoriums had had any
effect, caused the Moratorium
committee to change its tactics
to a local effort against the war,
rather than another national mo-
bilization.

Christmas Eve
In December, the main activity

of the anti-war movement in Pitts-
burgh was the Christmas Eve can-
dlelight march and service at the
Heinz Chapel. About 400 people
marched through the snow and
cold, some with children, from the
University and City Ministries,
and around the snow-covered Ca-
thedral lawn to the Chapel. The
services consisted of a continuous
group of speakers and folk music
and a continuing march.

January anti-war activities will
consist basically of Saturday sem-
inars on peace and related topics.

WFor the University of Pitts-

burgh, the year 1969 was a year of
political peaks. It was a year when
issues of free speech, ROTC cred-
it, the grading system, the curri-
culum, racial discrimination, and
the board of trustees came under
scrutiny and attack.

One of the most popular and
most vocalized issue was the case
of Alternatives, a student publica-
tion. The editors of Alternatives
claimed that their ROTC issue

(predominately against ROTC)‘

was stolen by several Pershing
Rifles members, a fraternity of
ROTC. Some days later, a few
members of ROTC discovered the
inscription of obscene words re-
lating to President Nixon micros-
copically printed within the art-
work of the cover of the issue. The
entire issue was brought before
the Student Publications Board,
and the words in question were
found non-libelous.

Student Government. under
President Ken Scheuler. passed a
resolution supporting Alterna-
tives’ right of free speech, and
condemning Central Printing for
not printing the publication be-
cause it contained some “objec-
tionable” words.

In January, another type of free-
dom came into question, soon to
be complicated with the free
speech issue. Black students sat in
at the computer center until Chan-
cellor Posvar would comply “posi-
tively” with the “better action for
blacks” demands of the group.
That night, Posvar and the Black
Action Society came to an agree-
ment that the University would
act more quickly on black studies,
black student recruitment, and in-
-creased black faculty and staff.

Soon after that demonstration,
State ‘Senator Robert Fleming

‘proposed a bill in response to the

black sit-in, the ROTC demonstra-
tions, and the free speech conflict.
Fleming’s plan, which was to be
applied to all state-operated uni-
versities, proposed that when a stu-
dent enrolled, he would be given a
list of rules and would be told that
if he refused to follow them, he
would not be allowed to matricu-
late. If after enrolling, he would
willfully violate any of the rules,
he would be subject to punish-

Jan. 20. 1969. Pitt students saw
the writing on the wall. that fore-
shadowed a great deal of violence
directed toward the University
community. Midnite artists print-
ed “Get out or be bombed—Ma-,
fia" on several University walls.
and directed this threat toward
the BAS. and a six-pointed star.

As the term progressed. March
18 saw the annual spring "Riot."
This year though. the riot ended
with a mob of students walking
down Forbes. up Boquet. back
down Fifth Ave.. and up to the
dorms. Eight students were put on
social probation for what the Uni-
versity called a “panty raid.”

Over the summer. the dormi-
tories experienced what was only
the beginning of their security
problems. On July 15. a home-
made bomb damaged room 405-B.
The occupants of the room. Tony
Embessi and David Rohana. were
both away at the time. but the
damage amounted to several hun-
dred dollars.

As the fall term began, students
found that their security was at
the most unsure. The weekend of
Sept. ‘5, after a BAS sponsored
dance, many students were as-
saulted on and around the campus
area. The following weekend prov-

ment. including suspension or ex-
plusion. One of the rules stipulated
that a student could not act or
speak in a “lewd or lascivious
manner."

Again under Ken Scheuler. Stu-
dent Government passed a resolu-
tion in favor of the action taken by
the blacks at the sit-in. It was one
of the last acts taken by that ad-
ministration. Scott Baum and Jeff
Barr were elected president and
vice-president after a campaign
based on reforming Student Gov-
ernment. Baum ran against Steve
O’Nei1 of Students for Progress
and Geoffrey Bauman of the cam-
pus chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society. Under
Baum’s administration, the Sen-
ate passed a resolution against
the Fleming Bill, but only after a
major floor fight,

All of the political issues were 1

suddenly brought out into the open
with the first teach-in in the Ca-
thedral Commons Room last Feb-
ruary. A group of about 800 stu-
dents gathered to discuss several
demands on University policies.
The demands were: to end all
forms of censorship at the Univer-
sity; to uphold the faculty’s deci-
sion to abolish academic credit
for ROTC; to have the adminis-
tration take a public stand against
the Fleming Bill; to let the stu-
dents know of any student inform-
ers on campus; to cease the prac-
tice of keeping secret files on all
undergraduate women, and to al-
low the faculty to freely discard
the grading system at their dis-
cretion. - -

After this teach-in, there oc-
curred a series of discussions and
teach-ins open to the University
community. The same issues were
discussed, but nothing was re-
solved to anyone’s satisfaction.
Dissatisfaction, disappointment,
and disgust climaxed March 11
when a meeting of 100 students in
the Commons Room swelled into a
marathon teach-in of more than
900 in the Common Facilities (CF)
building. The meeting broke up
when an injunction was served at
4:30 a.m. against the remaining
300 participants.

The teach-in was touched off by
the refusal of Thomas Rea, chair-
man of the University Board of

ed to be no safer for dorm stu-
dents. Friday afternoon, a fire
ripped through the lobby of Tower
A, causing an estimated $6,000
worth of damage. In an issue of

nie Kobosky, vice-chancellor of
Student Affairs, promised the stu-
dents more protection in the fu-

Trustees. to hold an open meeting
with the students and faculty to
discuss grievances and propose a
change in the selection of board
members.

The initial group of 100 left the
Commons Room and headed for
CF with plans to fast for three
days and occupy the building.
Their wish was to break up into
smaller groups after the CF clos-
ed at 10 p.m. to conduct discus-
sion groups on such topics as the
role and functions of the Univer-
sity, curriculum, and non-viol-
ence.

The "free university” recon-
vened next evening in the Social
Sciences Building, after receiving
a permit to stay there during the
next two days of the three-day
fast and teach-in. After the teach-
in ended, the Concerned Students
and Faculty issued a statement
showing their concern for three
general matters: “the curriculum
of the University, the making of
decisions in the University, and
the relationship between the Uni-
versity and the community.”

The day the statement was is-
sued, 110 students faculty of the
University’s School of Pharmacy
marched to the Cathedral vowing
support for the administration
and protesting the free university.
The free university, however, con-
tinued to hold sessions, (with less
publicity) until the close of the
term.

The summer term was one of
transition, when a turn towards
jpo-litics on a higher level than the
University began. Rallies, spon-
sored by the then—existing Univer-
sitv SDS condemned American so-
ciety and called for students to
move for improvement. (The ‘Uni-
versity SDS later dissociated
themselves from the national or-
ganization and became and inde-
pendent group called the Revolu-
tionary Socialist Union. )

fell victim to roving street gangs,

versity ID only. Ironically. the

When) the fall term started, one
of the first political conflicts stu-
dents became involved in was the
Black Coalition March in down-
town Pittsburgh. The March was
formed to protest the closed con-
struction unions in the city. A pe-
tition with over 200 signatures of
students and faculty was address-
ed to the Chancellor urging him
to suspend all construction at the
University over which he had con-
trol, and to request the Common-
wealth to take similar action with
its construction at the University.

The Chancellor issued a state-
ment claiming the the “Universi-
ty would support any satisfactory
agreement reached in the current
negotiations, and that if such an
agreement is not reached, the
University shall defer initiation of
any construction under its control
and shall request that the General
State Authority not initiate proj-
ects on behalf of the University
until we feel that satisfactory pro-
gress has been made in correct-

ing unjust employment practices."

Another political issue the stu-
dents embroiled themselves in
last term was the War. October 15
was the Moratorium. and the Uni-

versity took an official stand. en- ,

couraging all classes to be can-
celled. Over 7.000 students and
private citizens from the Pitts-
burgh area traveled to Washing-
ton. D. C.. for the November Mor-
atorium.

One of the few political conflicts

curity. an attempted holdup was
thwarted in the Hunt Room. Uni-
versity Security Officers Delaney
and Netz apprehended one of the
holdup men but another escaped.

On Friday. Sept. 20. another
weekend of violence began when
three to five hundred non-students
invaded the Circle K dance at the

last term was again over the is-
sue of the open trustee meeting.
Concerned students and faculty
held a sit-in for an open meeting
on the 36th floor of the Cathedral
before finally being able to set up
an all-University meeting to dis-
cuss the possibility of an open
board meeting. Although the meet-
ing concerned the board, a major
question on the students’ minds
was the relationship of the board
and the community. Students were
not satisfied with the answers they
received from trustees represent-
ing the board and walked out of
the meeting.

In most recent developments in
Student Government. President
Scott Baum» maintained, that the

1 bigge'st"V'pro‘"blem he had to cope

with during his administration
was “too much bureaucracy. The
body is not truly representative

of all students.” He claimed the

SG Senate “has no real power in
making decisions or enforcing
them." To remedy the situation.
he proposed that the Faculty Sen-
ate be expanded to include stu-
dent representatives.

The problem of Student Govern
ment. as well as the problems of
most of the other main. issues of
1969 are now carried over into
1970. Although the year is fresh,
the issues are old and generally
unsolved.

curred a month later, when Offi-

ures at the University have under-
gone a rugged trial. and much as
a result of the violence in 1969,
they have been improved and ex-
tended.

  SPORTS

SIXTY-NINE

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Casimir Myslinski accepted the
post of Athletic Director at the
University in 1968. but 1969 was
his first complete calendar year
as head of Panther sports.

Not long after his appointment
Myslinski hired Carl DePasqua as
head football coach for the ’69 sea-
son and the choice, even though it
had been labeled a “fifth choice."
proved to be a good one.

The football edition of the Pan-
ther turned in its best record since
1963, compiling a 4-6 mark. De
Pasqua had promised a rugged.
hard-nosed. "Western Pennsyl-
vania” style of football and deliv-
ered -just that.

The gridders didn’t miss the
".500 mark by much. Only 48 sec-
onds remained in a‘ home fray
against Tulane when the Green
Wave connected on a long touch-
down pass for a 26-22 victory over
the Panthers.

The 4-6 performance. which in-
cluded three wins over Eastern
rivals. gave the Jungle Cats a
share of sixth place in the final
Lambert ratings for supremacy
in the East, a position that many
followers felt was far too low. But
some of the players did receive
recognition.

Ralph Cindrich. called "the soul
of the team" by his coach. was
named to the Football News sopho-
more All-America squad and to
most All-East teams. Dave Mag-
yar also made All-East.

Geoff Brown was selected to
play in both the Shriners’ East-
West game and the attractive Hula
Bowl. Bob Ellis and Dave Dibbley
played in the Blue-Gray game.

There are other sports under
Myslinski’s supervision. of course.
And the first major schedule he
watched unfold didn’t turn out too
well. Buzz Ridl brought an im-
pressive mark from Westminster
as he assumed the coaching chores
of the Panther basketball team for
his first term. The results were
disastrous. if not embarrassing.
for Ridl who was used to winning.

The final mark of four wins. 20
losses was the worst Panther hoop
production ever. The poor show-
ing was basically caused by a
weak 39.1 shooting percentage.
with the season’s low point com-
ing in a 52-30 defeat to Temple.

The freshmen had another fine
season (9-5) under Tim Grgurich.

Dave Adams’ wrestlers finished
3-6-1, but looked promising. Cind-
rich highlighted the grapplers’
campaign by snatching the heavy-
weight championship in the East-

erns and finishing fourth in the
Nationals. That fourth place fin-
ish made Cindrich an All-Amer-
ican wrestler.

Adams‘ freshman had a 1-2
mark. but good individual per-
formances and a fine recruiting
effort gives the grappler mentor
hope for the future of wrestling at
the University.

If any sport is expecting more
in the future than wrestling. its
track. Jim Banner has done an
excellent recruiting job, also. and
his trackmen‘s only black mark
was an outdoor loss to Penn State.

Jerry Richey, Bryant Salter,
Smitty Brown, and the relay teams

entered many invitationals across a

the country and met with ade-
quate success.

Almost all of the Panther track .

records were broken by the 1969
squad and a strong freshman team
contributed to a good year for
Banner. His cross country team
also saw good times. boasting a
6-1 record.

The 1969 Panther baseball team
was promised a new field. one
that would be on the campus. In-
stead they were forced to continue
to play out their schedule on the
Leech Farm Hospital Field. Their
play during the season had to be a
bigger disappointment. though.

The mitters’ claimed a 7-6
mark, battling hard for most of
their victories. A bad 1-6 mark
during a “pre-season” trip to
Florida could be added to that rec-
0rd.

The baseballers did have one
great day. They traveled to Hiram.
Ohio, and blasted their opponents
18-4. Joe McCain. one of six foot-
ball players on the mitt squad who
had seen many frustrating losses,
explained afterwards how “it was
great to murder someone else for
a change.”

McCain, by the way. missed the
’69 football season after breaking
a leg in a summer softball game.

The soccer team finally reach-
ed 1.500 in ’69 also. Their i5’-5-1
mark, like their football counter-
parts, was the best since 1965. A
new rule permitting freshmen to
compete was a big reason for Leo
Bemis’ success. Frosh booters’
John White and Gus Theofildis
scored 15 goals, more than the
whole team put into the nets in
1968.

The lesser sports continued be-
low par. but everything wasn't
bleak. Rex Peery's golfers had a

poor spring session. but-acameo

back to compete in a fall tourna-
ment for a new first. The golfers
finished second in the fall East-

erns. with Mike Jones winning
medal honors.

The swimming and gymnastic
squads had problems during the
winter. but both began to show life
as their sea sons ended.

The tennis team, however, nev-
er showed signs of breathing. The
final mark was 0-13 with Tom
Stromp the only member to win a
match all season long. Ben Pope
lost his job after the season, be-
ing replaced by Fran Webster,
who also assists Ridl with the has-
ketball team.

The only other team on campus
has always been a winner. but few
have taken notice. Sergeant Bill
Sarver’s rifle team's season runs
the length of two school terms.
and they still find it hard to lose.
Last winter they compiled a 9-1
mark, the one loss not counting in
the West-Penn League standings.

Arlniinistrative Changes

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Administrative changes at the
University were both numerous
and significant in 1969. Several top
administrators left their posts
during the course of the year. cit-
ing diverse reasons for their res-
ignations but causing many to

wonder whether or not a changed
campus mood sparked the separ-
ate but similar actions.

Among those who vacated their
positions were the deans of the
College of Arts and Sciences

(CAS) and the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences <FAS>. As a result. the
changing of the guard at the Ca-
thedral. while relevant to the en-

DR. JEROME I.. ROSENBERG

tire University community. was
of particular importance to lib-
eral arts students.

Dean David Halliday of the FAS
began the process when he resign-
ed in the middle of March for
health reasons. Shortly after-
wards, Dean James Kehl of the
CAS followed suit. citing “per-
sonal and professional reasons"
for his departure. His deputy, Dr.
James Watson, assistant dean of
the CAS, also left.

 

Dr. Jerome Schneewind of the
Philosophy Department was ap-
pointed the new dean of the CAS
in April-probably the most signi-
ficant appointment of the year.
Bringing a new look to the admin-
istration, Schneewind impressed
students with his anxiousness to
understand their point of view and
proceeded to investiage the possi-
bilities of meaningful changes in
curriculum, requirements and
and grading.

Although Dr. Steele Gow tem-
porarily replaced Dean Halliday
as head of the FAS. Dr. Jerome
Rosenberg was later named to the
post. The chairman of the Depart-
ment of Biophysics and Microbio-
logy. Rosenberg has been identi-
fied in the past with those seeking
change at the University and thus
might be expected to work along
with Dean Schneewind towards
that end.

The administrations deck con-
tinued to be reshuffled. Early in
June. William Markus. assistant

dean of Students. and David Gine-
van. director of Housing. announc-
ed their attention to enter the busi-
ness world. While the decision
seemed to be mainly a positive
one. Markus did complain upon
leaving that students frequently
want power but refuse to accept
concomitant responsibilities.

Administrators shifted their
positions as John Vrana left his
post as director of Student Affairs
Planning to become director of
Housing. With another opening.
Daniel McFadden assumed
Vrana‘s former position of direc-
tor of Student Affairs Planning.

Before observers could catch
their breath, Dr. Jack Critchfield,
assistant chancellor for Student
Affairs, joined the ranks of the re-
signed in June, leaving the Univer-
sity to become president of R0]-
lins College in Winter Park, Fla.,
and to serve on the North Caro-
lina Board of Higher Education.

.,«Filling the spot vacated by
Critchfield. Bernard.Kobosky re-
signed as director of Admissions
and became assistant chancellor
for Student Affairs. He quickly
impressed students with his capa-
city to get at the roots of problems
and his willingness to tackle diffi-
cult tasks. Moving up a notch, As-
sistant Director of Admissions
Fred Robie assumed Kobosky’s
former post.

Other appointments occurred
too and blacks were among the
appointees. Dr. Edward Barnes.
Dr. Tobias Dunkelberger. Rober-
ta Salper and Ralph Proctor were
named assistant CAS deans. Chen-
its Pettigrew and Lloyd Bell also
assumed’ important administra-
tive posts.

In a nutshell, then. the admin-
istration certainly changed in
1969. but what did it all mean?
Rash conclusion would be inappro-
priate.

University Dental School Revisedi

(Editor's Note: This story was
researched in response to inter-
est and curiosity about the new
curriculum at the University’s
School of Dental Medicine.)

by SHERRI ZIPPAY
Literary Editor

“The science of dentistry
must prepare the future den-
tist to function in today’s so-
ciety and also to understand
and adapt to the changing
needs of society,” according to
the philosophy of the faculty of
the University’s School of Den-
tal Medicine.

Development

The development of an edu-
cational program to achieve
this goal led to the following
procedures of innovative cur-
riculum construction. The pre-
sent and future needs of socie-
ty were studied through sur-
veys,_ literature, and a confer-
ence with various social scien-
tists. Broad goals were formu-

. lated and expressed in a state-

ment of philosophy pertaining
to present and future dental
practice and dental education.
From this were derived more
specific behavioral objectives
to guide selection of learning
experiences. The learning ex-
periences were then organiz-
ed, in a manner to effect cor-
relation. Evaluation of the cur-
riculum was incorporated as
part of the program.

The draft of the new curri-

culum was presented to faculty‘

members at the annual faculty
institute in June, 1968, result-
ing in the decision to begin im-
plementing the first year of
the new curriculum in Septem-

ber, 1968.

The dental student body is
represented on the curriculum
committee by seven members.
The method of choice of these
representatives is on the initia-

Curriculum Rationale

A spokesman for the faculty
explained that the new curri-
culum is based on the concept
that “as society changes, the
role of everyone gradually
changes with it.”

“This means,” he continued,
“that the role of the dentist in
the future will include use of
much greater knowledge of
prevention of disease, and di-
agnosis and planning treat-
ment of existing disease. As
society become more aware of
what is now scientifically and
technically possible, the den-
tist will need to extend his per-
sonal skills to the area of more
complicated orofacial prob-
lems, such as those related to
development and growth.

Also, there is much agree-
ment within the dental profes-
sion in that auxiliaries must be
more efficiently utilized in the
delivery of oral health serv-
ices and that greater stress
must be placed upon the role
of the fully-trained profession-
al as a supervisor of these aux-
iliaries- S 0

Committed to the education-
al school of thought that the or-
ganization of learning experi-
ences plays an extremely im-
portant role in enhancing for
the student the relevance of
those experiences to his needs
as a professional person, much
attention was given to the util-
ization of principles of learn-
ing in the design of the curri-
culum.

Curriculum Design

The design consists of six
major areas which cut across
the four years ofthe program:
Human Biology, Clinical Bio-
logy and Technology, Methods
of Science, Professional and
Social Perspectives, Individ-
ualization, and Evaluation. The

purpose of this grouping of
learning experiences is to
blend the traditional depart-
ments in order to effect multi-
disciplinary correlation. Many
of the details of the program
were not only planned by inter-
disciplinary committees, but
are also taught by interdisci-
plinary teams.

and if its objectives and meth-
odologies were relevant to the
needs of the student aspiring
to practice dentistry.

Sciences are integrated into
concepts rather than disci-
plines and are arranged in a
sequence to give the student an
understanding of the processes

Each teaching sequence
suggested to the curriculum
committee by the faculty was
examined to determine if it
was consistent with the philo-
sophy of the new curriculum

tion of each class. They may

-be appointed by class presi-

dents, elected by the entire
class, or selected from mem-
bership of student curriculum
committees. The student rep-
resentatives participate (with
faculty coordinators) in curri-
culum committee meetings.
They receive all committee do-
cuments in order to enable
them to report committee de-
liberations to their peers.

The Human Biology area of
the new curriculum is entirely
interdisciplinary and includes
examples from clinical dentis-
try to illustrate the application
of the basic biological and be-
havioral sciences. Clinical Bio-
logy and Technology intro-
duces clinical experiences in
the first year in order to moti-
vate the student, to correlate
with the basic sciences, and to
facilitate accomplishment of
basic skills (including man-
ual) at a period in the curri-
culum earlier than before.

Methods of Science is de-
signed to aid the student in de-
veloping a systematic and in-
quisitive approach to the prob-
lems of diagnosis, treatment
planning, therapy, and other
areas of professional activity.

Solve Your

Professional and Social Per-
spectives provides experiences
intended to furnish a broad
perspective of the responsibil-
ities and opportunities related
to the practice of dental medi-
cine. Many of the activities in
this area are student centered.
The class has the prerogative
to conduct sessions on their
own or to invite resource peo-
ple from the faculty, profes-
sional, or lay groups.

From time to time the class .1

responds to current issues in
reports to the faculty. Students
are involved in the community
as much as possible by field
trips, summer jobs, and pre-
sentations by guest speakers
from other areas of the Uni-
versity. For example, students
have visited four schools for
exceptional children in the
Pittsburgh district, conducted
dental surveys for kindergar-
ten children in two public
schools, and have provided
preventive treatment and oral
health education for children
from other school systems.

Contrary to the rigid lock-
step design of the traditional
curriculum, an effort is being
made through individualization
to make special allowances for
individual interests and com-
petencies. Once competence in
an area is certified, the student
will be freed from that assign-
ment to accelerate progress in
other areas. The school also
maintains an advisory system
with a ratio of one advisor for
each seven students.

Evaluation is not only for
the purpose of testing individ-
ual student achievement, but is
also to evaluate the progress
of the curriculum. This pro-
gress is monitored through a
series of feedback tests and

attitudinal surveys. The “cri—
tical incident technique” is
used to elicit student percep-
tions of their learning experi-
ences. “In-course” tests are
of the feedback variety and re-
sults are distributed to the stu-
dents and their advisors. This
strategy is designed to assist
students in early identification
of their strengths and weak-
nesses.

There is considerable dialo-
gue in most universities on the
subject of grading and quality
point systems. The facutly of
the School of Dental Medicine
had been examining the valid-
ity and reliability of grading
systems for several years. The
sub committee on evaluation
recommended the elimination
of course credits and the adop-
tion of a pass/fail system
with class rankings establish-

ed on the basis of comprehen-

sive examinations. The con-
tent of these examinations,
which are given three times
per year, is correlated in a
manner which is compatible
with the interdisciplinary ap-
proach to teaching. Students
who perform at or above an ac-
ceptable level on these tests
are ranked on the basis of their
test scores. On the student
transcript there is only the no-
tation of pass or fail.

The basic knowledge of the
curriculum gives flexibility to
the future dentist and facili-
tates adaptibility to changes
occurring in dentistry and so-
ciety as a result of rapid ad-
vances in technology. Students
treat patients early in the first
year, beginning with simpler
forms of treatment.

This ‘continues for the first
three years of the program.
During th fourth year the stu-
dent will have the opportunity
for externships and individual
programs or possibly to take
advanced programs during his
pre-doctoral career. Third and
fourth year students will also

“They were a running team."
assistant coach Fran Webster

The Mountaineers and the Col-

conquest.

the district. He.is Laurel High-
lands" Wilbur Robinson. the 61"
guard who attracted plenty of at-
tention during
team’s march to a state champion-
ship in 1968.

Right now Robinson‘s average
is flirting with the 20 point
mark. ’

The bothersome guard might
not be the first thing people will
notice while watching the Moun-
taineers practicing before the
game. There will be one head
sticking out above most of the
others. “

The head will belong to Mike

from Garrett. Ind. His height is
more than enough to assure the
tallest Panther ever. Paul O'Gor-
ek. of a busy evening.

O‘Gorek. by the way. has gain-
ed on Mike Paul in the battle for
scoring in the Jungle Cat line-up.
His 24 points against George
Washington raised his average to
12.7. Paul‘s hitting the nets at
a 13.2 clip.

Kent Scott is the only other Pan-
ther in double figures, with an 11.7
average.

"We’re shooting better.“ Ridl
said. “If you look at our shooting
percentage you‘ll see it's getting
close to 40 per cent. When you
start sneaking to 40-42 per cent.
you can call it a good job."

Cleveland Edwards. who does-
n‘t score many points. continues
to receive credit for the few mo-
ments of success the cagers have
had thus far.

“We get a kid like Cleve in there
and he picks us up,” Ridl said.
“We want to get the speed, the
shooting, and the ball-handling in
our game.”

Edwards still'isn’t in top condi-

tion because of dental problems
and a leg injury which have

hampered his practicing. so he
won't start tonight. He will be

es feel they need him on the court.

When Bob Rosborough was a freshman football player
at the University, his assistant frosh coach was none other
than Carl DePasqua. Now Rosborough and DePasqua are
together again and right now they’re in the midst of put-
tingtogether still another freshman team.

Rosborough, who played on two bowl teams for the
Panthers in the 50’s, was named assistant athletic director
before vacation and his main area of concentration will be
necruiting.

“I’ll be coordinating the efforts of all the coaches,”
explained the new assistant AD. “I won’t be the number
one salesman. The coaches and athletes are your bread and
butter recruiters. I’ll be coordinating the total effort. My

’ job will be more of an administrative function, at least for

a while. Later on, I hope to increase my contacts.”

Rosborough explains that he’s not really a full-time
recruiter, because his job involves more. “I’m to be con-
cerned with everything that involves the student athlete
himself. I’ll be the direct liason with the student. So Pitt
doesn’t really have a full-time recruiter.” ‘

Recruiting efforts are going on in all sports right now,
and recruiting is a 365-day job for many coaches and play-
ers. But naturally football is the big concern right now.

Last season, DePasqua was hired as the Panther coach
in January and was not only faced with a late start in his
recruiting, but had to build his coaching staff as well. This
year, DePasqua has a full staff in tact for recruiting and
the competition is in full swing for the top high school
prospects.

Football recruiting has been going on since early fall,

but it’s still to early yet for specifics. “We’re in a good '

competitive situation with the best prospects,” explains
Rosborough, “but recruiting is an unpredictable going.

. “We’re hopeful of an excellent year in football recruit-
ing,” he continued. “We know we need one. We hope this
will be a real big year for us.”

The idea of hiring a special assistant for recruiting
had been in the wind for some time and the move involving
Bob Rosborough has to be considered a good one. As a Pitt
alum and former grid star, Rosborough has a love for the
school and sincere desire to put the Panthers back on top,
not only in football but in all sports.

“The people I’m working with are people I have grown
up with; they’re personal friends,” Rosborough comment-
ed. “We’re Pitt people and we have a lot of stake in the
school. I think we’re making a good move and I feel real
enthusiastic about it."

For First Willi Tonight

by BILL N AAB
Staff Sports Writer

When two losers clash. one must surrender its
state of failure. And the Cub hoopsters feel that
they‘re ready and able to dispose of the infamous
image.

Coach Tim Grgurich‘s Cubs greet the Little
Mountaineers of West Virginia at 6:15 tonight at
the Field House. The Cubs are winless in two starts.
They are also prone to the same disease which has
struck down the varsity Panthers. roaditis. The
losses have been inflicted on rival courts. at Robert
Morris and Youngstown.

The Little Mountaineers. meanwhile. have tast-
ed defeat in their first three contests of the season.
They have yet to discover whether or not they are
also bugged by the evils of away basketball games.
All three losses have occurred before the home-
town fans—Dec. 6. Richmond won 64-63: Dec. 9.
Robert Morris captured a 90-77 victory: then on
Dec. 13. Ohio Valley squeeked out a 66-65 win.

Although Tim Grgurich couldn’t name a starting
lineup as of Monday, he implied that his Cubs are
healthy and anxiously awaiting the opportunity to
claw into the West Virginians.

"They should be ready to go. If they're not. then
there's something wrong." stated Grgurich.

"We've been changing our lineup constantly.
There are seven or eight players who have been see-
ing a lot of action. Right now. I couldn‘t say who
might start." . I, I -

Tonight Grgurich will have the option of using a
player who did not participate in the 86-72
Youngstown loss. The player is 6-4 Randy Ar-
nold, an All-Gary, Ind., high school star who missed
the previous encounter because of illness.

The WVU, frosh who will aim to gun-down the
Panthers are: 6-8 Mike Carson. 6-8 Gary Reichen-
becher. 6-6 Larry Harris. 6-3 Harold Black. and
6-3 Levi Phillips. Larry Pugh and Ike Harris are
the sixth and seventh men on the squad.

Reichenbecher averaged 26.9 points a game as
a high school senior. His 230 lbs. of beef should pro-
vide plenty of pains to the Panther frontcourtmen.

Carson’s credentials seem even more impres-
sive. Cage Scope. Basketball Yearbook. and Schol-
astic Magazine all named the big forward to their
high school All-America teams.

Phillips and Harris were named Al1—State in
West Virginia while Black placed on the All-Poto-
mac first team.

The battle which should shape-up under the
boards between Carson and Reichenbecher of WVU
and 6-8 Bill Sulkowski and 6-6 Carl Morris of the
Cubs could possibly rival the legendary battle be-
tween the Hatfields and the McCoys.

Desire To Will
Spurs Kuhn To
Mat Triumphs

by MIKE MILLER

The swimming world may have missed a great champion
when Bob Kuhn emerged from the depths and turned to
wrestling, but many Eastern wrestlers may wish he had stayed in

the pool.

“I’ve been swimming since I
was three,” says Kuhn, "My old-
er brother Tom got me interest-
ed in wrestling. I started when I
was in the tenth grade.”

“In high school my coach
taught me the desire to win.” he
relates.

This desire has spurred Kuhn
to many wrestling honors. Bob
went undefeated as a freshman
and chalked up a 6-3 record as
a sophomore. Last year he fin-
ished fourth in the Easterns. His
season record so far stands at
4-0, the best on‘ the team.

One of his most gratifying ex-
periences as a wrestler occured
last Saturday at Navy when he
won his match in the last three
seconds with a reversal, squeez-

 ing past his opponent 15-14. For

his performance he received a
standing ovation from the Navy
fans.

"It was quite an experience,
“He remarked, “the ref had to
go to the side lines to make the
score official and when the win
wasannounced the crowd start-
ed to applaud. My parents were
in the stands and they later said
it was a standing ovation. I was
completely exhausted but when
I heard the applause it made
the effort worth while.”

Tom Tomlinson, the midship-
man whom he beat, was an out-
standing sophomore who went
undefeated on the plebe team.

As far as his immediate goal
is concerned Bob says, “I’d like
to be Eastern champ but my goal
is to go to the Nationals.” ‘

His ultimate goal however is
to be an All American.

Bob also thinks the matmen
have a good chance to be in the
top ten in the nation with the
help of the freshmen.

’ Kuhn believes his toughest
opponent of the season will be
Jack Bentz of Lehigh. Bentz is
the Eastern champ at 167, and
an All-American.

“I think I can give him a good
match and I’d like to win,”
Kunn stated.

Concerning his strategy he
revealed, “So far I’m in good
condition. Its my main strength.”
Bob tries to stay in top condi-
tionso he can wear his oppon-
ent down. “Thats how I won at
Navy,” he remarked.

This Saturday Bob will defend
his record against Ted Ander-
son or Bill Schmitt of Temple.

Confident Thinclad

Brown Eyes Records

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

When Smitty Brown was a sophomore at Coraopolis high
school, he won the Pennsylvania state broad jump champion-
ship, but an injury cut short his career as a jumper.

But with track and field in his blood. Smitty wasnft about to

give up the sport. So he switched
to the running events and two
years later, he reigned as the
state champ in the quarter mile
distance race.

Today Smitty Brown is still
running and he’s still setting
records. He holds the Univer-
sity record in the 600 yard run
and is also a member of the re-
cord holding mile relay team.
But Smitty isn’t satisfied yet.
He’s confident he can do better.
“I’m almost positive I can lower
my time in the 600,” Smitty ex-
plains. “I’d like to run 109.5 or
109.6.”

The world record in the 600
currently stands at 1:09 flat and
even that may be in reach for
the junior star. “I think any-
thing’s possible,” he continued.
“I need a few good meets
though.” Smitty’s best time thus
far stands at 1211.1.

In addition to the 600, Smitty
also runs in the mile relay and
this week in the Kent State meet
he’ll be experimenting a little.
“I usually run the anchor leg in
the event, but Saturday I’m go-
ing to lead off and Dorel Watt-
ley will run anchor.”

Last year Smitty ran some
shorter distances as well and he
expects to be seeing some action
in the 50 yard dash this season.
“The coach used me there so

Squahble Cited As One Reason
For Riﬂe Loss To Clarion State

The rifle team came back from a long layoff and lost
their first West-Penn League match of the season Saturday.

But Sergeant Bill Sarver, the sharpshooters’ coach, doesn’t think
that the idleness was the only reason for the 1272-1247 loss to Clar-

ion State.

“The layoff effected us,” he
said. “But also there was a little

squabble. They (the riflers)
don’t have confidence. 0ne’s
blaming the other for it.

“We had a meeting and I hope
we have things straightened
out.” I

Theleading scorer for the rif-
lers Saturday was John Taucher,
who shot a 258. Mike Simondejka
followed with a 256.

Sarver’s squad has a 9-1 re-

of Coco, a very entertaining mu-
sical that provides the snack rath-

Coco appears to be a lavish mu-

it is totally convincing that it could

Nylon. Reverse osmosis.

Aﬁber that started making girls’ legs more beauti-
ful some 30 years ago.

And a process that's been around a lot longer.

But when Du Pont scientists and engineers look
at them in a new way. they combine into an idea that
can change the world.

Reverse osmosis is a puriﬁcation process that
requires no phase change. it's potentially the cheap-
est way to desalinate water.

Du Pont’s innovation? Hollow, semipermeable ny-
lon ﬁbers much ﬁner than human hair. Symmetrical.
with an outer diameter of .002 inch and a wall thick-
ness of .0005 inch. with an accuracy of manufacture
maintained at close to 100%. Twenty-ﬁve to 30 million
of them encased in a precisely engineered unit 14
inches in diameter by 7 feet long.

The result: a semipermeable surface area of about
85.000 square feet—the size of a 2-acre lot——and up
to 10,000 gallons of desalted water per day.

So far "Permasep”® permeators have been used
experimentally to purify brackish and polluted water.
and in various industrial separations. But the po-
tential to desalt seawater. too, is there.

So Du Pont scientists and engineers are even now
working toward improved ﬁbers, units and plant
designs that should make it possible to get fresh
water from salt at a price that any town or nation
can aﬁord.
