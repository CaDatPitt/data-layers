Amanda Tizio and Ryan Bolla sit W

in~ Fuel and Puddle, joking and 
fun at one another. '

“Ryan, you’re such a player,” said
Tizio as Bolla discussed his multiple
present and ex—girlﬁiends _

“I can’t take her anymore,” said
Bolla, pretending to be annoyed. ‘-‘I’m
gonna quit you.”

Tizio laughed, and they hugged.

\When their food came, Tizio cut
Bolla’s sandwich for him while he talk-
ed about his diet and desire for a new
tattoo. He already has one to com-
memoiate his late grandfather.

Bolla, 21, is one of '50 people with

[intellectual disabilities who meet with
Pitt students through the Best Bud— .

dies organization ,
Best Buddies, which draws par-

ticipants from colleges, the workplace,

high schools and middle schools, cre-
ates one-on—one ﬁziendships by 

buddies through chapter organiza-

tions across thecountry.

. Tizio, a junior, is president of Pitt’s
chapter and has  with
the organization since her freshman
year.

"The buddies are infectious,” said
Tizio. “When you meet them, you
want to be their friends, and they want

to be yours” A
Alexis Miller, the program coor-

dinator for Best Buddies in Western

Pennsylvania, said that each college
group has a host site. i

Hand-washing. It might not seem like
something that should be taught in college,
but it’s a lesson that Pitt’s medical school

stresses to its students, who will come in‘

contact with diseases on a regular basis.
Despite the many precautions health

care workers take, hospitals can be places

where people catch infections.
“[Registered nurses] have toomany pa-

tients to take care of,” said Patricia Eakin,
' president of the Pennsylvania Association

of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. -

“I’ve seen people cut corners.”

Eakin has been a registered nurse since
1976. . '

She said that even though she makes a
vigilant effort to stave off infection and
encourages others to do the same, over the

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

years she has seen other nurses neglect this
responsibility.

Hand hygiene, a broad category that
includes hand-washing, glove-wearing and
the use of alcohol-based_ hand sanitizer, is
sometimes ignored when health care work-
ers are pressed for drrie. '

Eakin said, “Maintaining a safe environ-

ment for patients is extremely important.

We want to do everything we can to make I

the hospital a safe environment.”

Dr. John Mahoney, a dean at Pitt’s med-
ical school, said hand—washir1g is the most
effective way to ﬁght infection.

Mahoney, who oversees the develop-

ment of the medical school’s curriculum,

said students are taught the proper hand-‘

washing techniques before they enter
their ﬂ_rst_ lab at the opening of the medi-

cal school and in the context of a specific

Dr. Elizabeth \X/ettick, medical direc-
tor‘ of Pitt’s Student Health Center, also

stressed the importance of the prevention . .

of the spread of infection between staff
members and‘ students.

“All the staff here are extremely dili-
gent about sanitation and cleanliness,” said
Wetdck in an e-mail. “I believe we are ex-

Mahoney also said that even though not"

sion, medical professionals‘ fail to live up
to the rigorous standards of infection con-

medical environment. '
“The culture has changed so that a

nurse can say to a doctor, ‘V./hy haven’t you

washedyour hands?”"said Mahoney. '
Mahoney explained‘ that in the past,
nurses would rarely confront doctors on
the topic. However, infection prevention is
now recognized as a priority of the health
care system.
“\We are much more effective at pre-

recycling
Christmas
trees

by Estelle Tran
Aadtlrta/zt New Editor

The City of Pittsburgh created drop—off
sites in parks for old Christmas trees des-
tined for recycling, Allegheny County chief
executive Dan Onorato announced last Fri-
day.

The program operates with the help of
Allegheny Green, a county environmental
initiative. Eventually, the old trees will be
turned into mulch and used in nine parks in
the region.

All tinsel and decorations must be re-
moved from trees before they are depos-
ited at the sites.

The drop—off points are located in
Boyce, North, South and Settler’s Cabin
parks by the parks’ swimming pools. Friday,
Jan. 23, is the last day to unload Christmas
trees.

to give all its members a chance to get together. In
the past theyfve gone to the Science Center, Pitt
games and movie premieres.

It’s up to the buddies to organize the other
activity. Tizio said the most popular activities
include bowling, movies and going to lunch or
dimer i

Tizio and Bolla often go to the mall, where
Bolla has her listen to the newest rap albums, and
she makes him help her pick out an outﬁt from
Forever 21, her favorite store

She said Bolla always beats her when they go
bowling because he’s so good that he’s on the
Special Olympics  team.

Lurcio said her buddy, Terrance Wood, en-
joys going to church.

“I showed him St Paul’s Cathedral, and he
was arnaz ” she said.

Wood also enjoyed the Variety of food at
Market Central whenshe used one of her meal
passes to take him there

Once a month, Lurcio sends out friendship

updates to ensure that the buddies fulﬁll their du- 4

ties. Tizio calls any members who don’t respond
and said that most of the time problems arise
from scheduling conﬂicts rather than personality
conflicts.

Miller said that both the buddy and the stu-
dent have to be dedicated for the program to

.work.

“Sometimes, it’s hard to get together with
your buddy at certain times of the year,” she said,
“but it’s a commitment.” A

Although college students can’t stay involved
with Best Buddies after graduation, Tizio said
most stay in touch. ' _ ’

Best Buddies International has a citizens’ pro-
gram that allows people unafﬁliated with a school
to participate The organization, however, doesn’t
offer the program in Pennsylvania

Miller said that the state lacks many of Best
Buddies’ programs, like the citizens’ program, be-
cause of  ' A

-“I would really like  [have one], but I don’t
see it happening any time soon,” said Miller.

Best Buddies also holds a 12-hour scavenger
hunt each year in March to raise money. The
fundraiser is called Midnight Madness and runs
from noon to midnight;

This will be its second year, and anyone can
participate People are grouped into teams, and
each team sets its own  goal

Miller said they expect teams do  like get
a picture taken with a stranger or see how many
people can ﬁt into an elevator.

“It has the potential to be a lot of fun,” said
Miller. “It’s different than just selling candy”

There are prizes for the winners, but Miller
said the prizes come after the ﬁm and fundrais-
inggml C

Back in Fuel and Fuddle, Tizio shivered in her
red Best Buddies T-shirt;

“It’s so cold when the door opens,” she said.

“No, it’s not,” argued Bolla. ,

, ‘Tm blocking it for you,” said Tizio.

Bolla gave her a hug.

Mahoney said technology has also fu-
eled the change. He explained that alcohol-
based hand sanitizer has only been around
for about 18 years.

“If you can just turn to- the right and get
a little squirt [of hand sanitizer], it makes
everything a lot easier,” said Mahoney.

He explained that  convenience is
greatly beneﬁcial in getting medical pro-
fessionals to follow infection—control tech-
niques. _ _

\X/ettick also noted that hand sanitizer
was conveniently located throughout the
Student Health Center.

Mahoney stressed the importance of
being a proactive patient.

“It’s completely OK to ask [doctors] to
wash their hands,” said Mahoney. S

Maria Legato, a student at Pitt, recently
dropped a table on her foot and had to get
stitches under her toe.

She said she was pleased with the in-
fection prevention techniques used by the
medical personnel who treated her.

“Every time a doctor was going to be
touching my foot, they Washed their hands
and put new gloves on,” said Legato in an
e-mail. “I also noticed a Purell‘ dispenser
next to the door that anyone who entered
the room would use before leaving.

They opened new sterile gauze and in-
struments when needed and threw away
bloody gauze in a red trash can. .

At the doctor’s office, they washed their
hands and opened up a package of instru-
ments if they were needed.”

No. 1 rank is good for"
more than basketball

For the first time in history,
the Associated Press and the
USA Today/ ESPN Coach’s Poll
ranked the Pitt men’s basketball
team No. 1 in the nation. Pitt
received 70 of the 72 ﬁrst—place
votes in the AP poll, and 30 of
31 in the ESPN poll, beating out
former ﬁrst— and second-ranked
North Carolina and Connecti-
cut when they were both dealt
losses last week.

This is a momentous oc-
casion in the men’s basketball
program. Pitt has been a strong
contender in the Big East and
the NCAA championship for
the last seven years but has nev-
er made it to a top—ranked posi-
tion.

Now that the team has done
so, and assuming the players can
hold the ranking long enough to
make it count, Pitt could see fu-
ture bumps in enrollment and
have an easier time courting
and recruiting top athletes from
around the country, which only
gives the program more room
to grow.

Perhaps a more meaningful
victory could stem from Pitt’s
No. 1 ranking. It provides a ﬁrst
step toward building a meaning-
ful connection between the bas-
ketball program and Pittsburgh
at large.

In a way, the Pitt basketball
team. is Pittsburgh’s basketball
franchise. Despite other suc-
cessful professional teams like
the Steelers and the Penguins,
a professional basketball fran-
chise has never taken hold in
Pittsburgh —— the highest atten-
dance at Pittsburgh’s American
Basketball Association fran-
chise, the Pittsburgh Xplosion,
was just more than 2,000 peo-

ple.
In contrast, the Penguins av-

' eraged about 17,000 people per

game in 2007, and the Steelers
sat an average of 62,000 per

game.

Even the Pirates averaged
more than 22,000 people per
game -in 2007. Compared to
numbers like that, the Xplosion
can hardly compete.

Pitt’s basketball team is an-
other matter. Men’s games are
routinely sold out in the 12,500-
seat Petersen Events Center,
and students only make up a
portion of that ﬁgure.

Given that Pittsburgh is a
city so historically concerned

with its sports teams, increasing -

Pitt’s standings in the commu-
nity in any way is bound to have
positive effects.

Being ranked No. 1 is not
going to revolutionize the way
that college sports connect
to the wider community, but
it does provide a good start.
From here, Pitt should be able
to attract more attention to the
program simply because other
teams will be ranked against
Pitt’s program for the remain-
der of the season. i

‘ People also have to be care-
ful not to attribute too much
importance to the ranking —_ if
the numbers change next week
and the coaches knock Pitt back
down to second or third, people
aren’t going to think as much of
it as if the team had kept hold
of the title for a longer time

The players shouldn’t let it go
to their heads too much, either
—— this isn’t a mark of invulner-
ability. On the contrary, other
teams are going to be gunning
even harder to take Pitt down
now that it has ﬁnally gotten the
top spot.

Pitt deserves recognition for
this achievement, because it’s
great not only for the team but
for the whole University. It cer-
tainly isn’t a guarantee of vic-
tory, but it is a great way to get
people across the city and the
country interested.

Resolve to rethink your resolutions

by Erik Hinton
Colum/ziat

 

It’s about that time of "the year
when the weight of the bold New
Year’s resolutions you made, likely
amid a torrent of $5 champagne,
becomes noticeably heavy. For those
who haven’t already broken their res-
olutions — “No more cookies,” she
whirnpered as crumbs dribbled down
her stuffed checks —the weeks after
New Year’s are much like some soft

. purgatory where you have to ask

yourself over and over if you really
need to change.

Some deal with this soul-search-
ingbymakingtheirtravailloudlyand
widely known. You know the type.
Those  of hands and gnash-
ers of teeth who demand that you
recognizetheyhavebeenatthegym
every day this week. They throw their
sweat-stained bodies down on your
couch and make  allusions
to needing Icy Hot, just  you

, to compliment, not their ﬁgures, but

their resolve “No, not even Mandela
knew dedication like you do.”

Then there are those who deal
with New Year’s resolutions with a
constant wail about how poonly they
are keeping their goals

These are the dieters who have
not foregone even a single pack of

Ho Hos and, instead, seek the refor-
mation they have failed to achieve in
their bodies in the conciliatory words
of their acquaintances “You, like, to-

tally didn’t even need to go on a diet. ,

Ihearalittleextxaweightisinthis
year” For this group, resolutions are
not so much about  some-
thing unpleasant about oneself but
glghave never completely be-
lieved that the goal of resolu-
tions was actually to change
the resolver as much as

conjure up an air of freshness
and renewal.

W

 support that the allegedly
unpleasant diaracteiistic isn’t actually
unpleasant

On the other end of the spectrum,
we have the resolution naysayers We
have all heard the oratory of those
proud non-resolvers who claim that
New Year’s just prompts unauthentic
change, that resolutions never actually
make a difference and are just forced
upon us by the powers that want us to
feel guilty.

\V1th all the depth and profundity
of a collegiate tryingto assert some as-
inine categorical like, “All religions are
farces,” these resolution haters 
discouragement at theranks of exer-

cisers, dieters and no-more-swearing
folk. Secretly, they pine for the back-
bone to effect self—betterment

This divine comedy of New
Year’s resolutions makes one point
clear above all others: Resolution is
much more a social phenomenon
than a personal one After all, what
good is promising to get ripped if no
co—ecl asks if it’s all you in there? Why
would I want to stop biting my nails
unless my well—manicured friends
complimented my  cuticles?

However, I don’t think this social .

character is necessarily a bad  for
New Year’s resolutions I have never
completely believed that the goal of
resolutions was actually to change the
resolver as much, as conjure up an air
of freshness and renewal.

New Year’s resolutions might very
well be aimed at something of a ge-
stalt phenomenon. With all of these
folks grandstanding their sacriﬁces,
complaining about their shortcom-
ings and whining about resolution in
general, change is foregrounded in
most people’s minds .

By  an environment of A

people  about reformation, the
environment reforms After our holi-
day breaks of binging on cookies and
 ourselves between cushions
and marathons of trashy  reality
shows —-we all have our devils —- we
need to at least posture change lest we
slip into a disquieted

Worst vice president ever? What about Breckinridge?

by David Ryan .
T be‘ Daily At/Jenaeum
With the George W. Bush
presidency almost over and Pres-
ident-elect Barack Obarna getting

more and more airtime on the’

television, it’s no wonder that the
national media have become em-
broiled in theater. 0
Instead of i focusing on the
Bush administration’s last days

of leading the free world, the __

media have turned to asking the

president and Vice President‘

Dick Cheney how history will
remember them, their administra-
tions and everything just short of,
“Boxers or briefs?”

‘The president has long made
it evident that he’s already done
with this job and is_ instead plan-
ning for his presidential library (I
wonder if there’ll be the actual
copy of ‘7My Pet, Goat” he was
reading on Sept. 11, 2001?). [He’s
also ﬁguring out when, between
falling off a Segway and choking
on pretzels, he ‘can get back to
clearin’ that there brush in Craw-
fordf

But what of Cheney?
What about the elusive No. 2,

the man one heartbeat away from ‘

the presidency (and himself one
mechanically controlled heartbeat

' away from death) who’s spent
most of his time in ofﬁce hidden -

away in the recesses of the under-
world? _
He is a man shrouded in con-

stant mystery. He’s become a ._

ﬁgure characterized by his own
eccentricities, exaggerated, of
course, for comic effect. His bald
head, slumped againsthis shoul-
ders like his perfectly sneering
smile, has helped shape the public
image of this man as ‘a penguin-
esque, Darth Vader-style charac-
ter. ' '

His actions - like shouting
“Fuck you” to Sen. Patrick Leahy
on the Senate ﬂoor‘ and shoot-
ing his own friend in the face in a
hunting trip for quail — have done
little to shed that ‘image or repair
his rapport with‘ the American
people.

So it-’s no wonder that in a slew
of what can only be described as

an end-of-term reﬂective poll, the
vice president has been judged by
23 percent of the American peo-
ple as “the worst vice president in
American history.”

But is this really fair?

Sure, the man has shot his
friend in the face and appears as
a cold and calculating ﬁgure who
could frighten children with the
bat. of an eyelid. And sure, he re-
cently told Fox News that under
his ' authority, the use of water-
boarding has been allowed to ob-
tain secrets from terrorists.

But worst vice president ever?

Beyond Al Gore’s trumpet of
self-gloriﬁcation and dire envi-
ronmental concerns, how many
vice presidents can you honestly
remember whom you have a pub-
lic opinion about? Maybe George
Herbert Walker" Bush, but he

~ doesn’t count — he became a pres-

ident later on. Lyndon Johnson?
He’s out too, if only by Lee Har-
vey Oswald’s day trip to the Texas
Book Depository. '
Tirne.com, in what can only be
described as a fantastic feature for

those of us who wish to analyze
former vice presidents for his-
torical context in a 750-word col-
umn, has ranked 15 of “America’s

iWorst Vice Presidents.”

Aaron Burr, who served un-
der Thomas Jefferson from
-1801-41805, is noted 'on the front
page. According to the feature,
Burr killed Treasury Secretary
Alexander Hamilton, a founding
father of the nation, in a duel.
And, three years later, he planned
to attack the Spanish colony of
Mexico. Like Cheney, Burr had a
penchant for invading countries.

As for some of the other
scoundrels — well, I’ve frankly
never heard of Elbridge Gerry,
vice president under James Madi-
son (1813-181-4);'V/illiam Rufus
King, who served under Franklin
Pierce (1853), who died one day
after- returning to the country to
which he was due to serve; or his
successor John Breckinridge, who
served under James Buchanan
(1857-1861). , _

Vice presidents are gener-
ally unsung heroes, unless they

become presidents, win a Nobel
Peace Prize, run for president
(Gore did) or win an Oscar. All
of this is doubtful. I can’t see the
man who helped mastermind the
invasion of Iraq on faulty intelli-
gence winning a peace prize, not
do I see him running for any-
thing (except the newborn fur of
a newborn puppy — he is a cold,

cold man) in terms of ofﬁce or_

even being a contender for an Os-
car.

To label Cheney the worst vice
president ever might be jumping
the gun a little. Certainly, Vice
President-elect Joe Biden has a

-lot to live up to and a lot to be

judged by in his actions in ofﬁce.
But worst ever? I fear not — not
yet.

He is perhaps the most men-
acing, most fearful, most politi-
cally shrewd vice president ever.
Heis a man the American people
elected twice but know very little
about. He is the man behind the
curtains, pulling the strings of the
Bush presidency every step of the
way.

Hinton, page 8

Suddenly, we have an objective
again, even if it is somewhat artiﬁcial.
No matter how much the seventh-
year sophomore resolves to get a 4.0,
it’s not New Yeat’s that is  to
bring about the change he needs '

However, the more that seventh-
year sophomore resolves to get
straighf A's, the more the virtues of
good grades are extolled. In away,

~ New Year’s resolutions serve as a res-

urrection of the moral and social ar-

chitecture of communities By hear-; _

ing about what everyone else wants
to change about themselves, the social
sphere rebuilds its systems of worth.

November and December are-

largely about  families and
‘ fond feelings No matter what has
transpired, everyone gathers around
turkeys and trees and reminds each
other that there. are bonds that are

inviolable While this is a wonderﬁil‘

practice, the inevitable result of this
is a measure of laxity. By the end of
holiday break, you are low on moti-
vation. Then, New Yeafs Eve comes

 NeWYea_r's rebuilds society's worth

and sets you back a few days and
generally dissolves social order into a
sparkling 

Resolutions reﬁt our little worlds
with structure, even if it is only tem-
porary and superﬁcial They are a

valuable tradition of masquerading

virtue that succeeds in producing real
virtue as a mass effect. ThisJanuary,

"Justice Illuminated: The Art A
of Arthur Szy " ‘

Posner Center at CMU
Jan. 7 - March 28

1 - 4 p.m. Mon. — Fri.
and by appointment
Free admission

As a majority of the world slung
bullets and bombs during World War
II, Polish-bom artist Arthur Szyk
packed ammunition that wasa little
less lethal. ‘ ‘

\X/rth his poison-dipped paint
brush, Szyk gained fame for illustrat-
ing the cruelty and inequality all too
common during the early 1940s

Pittsburgh residents will have
the opportunity to catch a ﬁrsthand
glimpse at Szyk’s work as the traveling
exhibit “Justice Illuminated” makes a
stop at Carnegie Mellon Universityfs
Posner Center starting this week.
The show, organized by the Arthur
Szyk Society, will feature a wide array
of Szyk’s satirical cartoons and cari-
catures. Also on display will be the

Szyk-illustrated ‘books from CMU’s
own Posner Collection: “Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam,” ‘fHaggadah” and
“The Book of Ru .”

“This exhibit is unusual because
it boasts an interesting combination
of social commentary and beautiful

illustrations,” said Gloriana St Clair, V

CMU’s dean of University Libraries.
Szyk artfully juxtaposes Renais-
sance—inspired portraits with a mod-

ern attitude, as is the case with his

piece “Ink and Blood-” The se1f-por-
trait shows Szyk sketching at his desk
with his political caricatures coming
alive off the page i J

-“I do not say that art is my aim
— it is my means,” said Szyk, who
was also commissioned by US. Steel
and Coca‘ Cola to create advertise-
ment art. He utilized his artistic capa-
bilities to draw attention to the great
amount of prejudice many popula-
tions of the world were  "His
illustrations were featured ir1 publica-
tions like Time, Esquire and Collier’s

“JusticeIlluminated”isbrokeninto
three themes: World War 11, America

and Jewish Response Each portion
represents a focus of Szyk’s work.

His . at_1ti—Axis cartoon “Satan "

Leads the Ball,’ ’ for example, conﬁrms
where his allegiances were during the
war. The piece, completed in 1942,
shows gruesomely depicted Nazi
leaders following a devilish ﬁgure

Szyk stayed active in Wodd War II
in any way he could, including design-
ing a set of stamps to raise money for
the war effort .

' Szyk immigrated to America 
1940, shortly before the country
joined the Allies. Though he deeply
respected‘ Americanideals, he wasn’t
blind to the country’s faults The
land of golden ‘opportunity was still

plagued with racism. To his shock,

and dismay, four months before his
death in 1.951, th_e'House on Un-

' American Activities Committee of
the Senate placed an accusation on
Szyk because of the governments A

misinterpretation of his illustrations.
The America portion of “Justice Illu-
minated,” however, centers on Szyk’s

- more positive depictions

“Since the founder of CMU, An-

arts & entertaient

drew Carnegie, was an immigrant
and Szyk was an immigrant, you very
much get the immigrant experience
and how they impact life in America,’ ’
said St Clair, of the exhibits purpose

Whﬂe Szyk is generally most fa-
mous for his satirical pieces, St; Clair
explained, “He also did really gor-
geous religious illustrations.”

Szyk was born in 1894 to Jewish
parents and referred to religion as a
valuable part of his life Through his
artwork, Szyk formed irnage—based
interpretations of Scripture and was
able to convey his views of the Jew-
ish people wordlessly. He once said,
‘The Jewish‘ artist belongs to the
Jewish people, and it is his mission to
enhance the prestige of the Jews in
the world  His‘ task is to reveal to
the world our glorious past and our
tragic present.” , A

Szyk didn’t see his cartoons’ as just
any old laughing matter. Regardless
of the topic, he felt a deep "responsi-
bility to say as mtich as possible with

' At 2 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 25, ex-
hibit curator Ervin Unger will give a
public lecture about Szyk’s work and
his advocacy of humanity.

"University Libraries are ‘extreme-
ly pleased to be able to bring this
historic, aesthetic and instructive ex-
hibit to Pittsburgh and the region. We
hope that people of all ages will be
able to take advantage of this oppor-
tunity to remember both Szyk’s use
of art to giorify religious and poetic
works and to ﬁght against the forces
of oppression,” said St; Clair.

CMU’s campus but still interested in
seeing the exhibit can view the en-

Dark End of the Street

Cat Power ‘

Matador Records

Rocks like: Classic 19605 with a
Folk-rock twist

If you can say one
thing about Cat Power’s
Chan Marshall, it’s that
she loves her covers. .

v This third collection
of covers Marshall has
produced surely will not be the last.

Luckily, she puts the -cover concept
to good use. Despite the borrowed lyr-
ics and tunes, each note becomes Mar-

 

shall’s own, without question. One listen » .

to that soulful croon is all that’s needed
to prove her individuality as an artist.

In the past, Chan Marshall has in- i

terpreted the hits of‘ Bob Dylan, the
Rolling Stones,']ames Brownand Joni
Mitchell. She leaves distinctly dissimilar
songs weaved together with her folk-
rock edge in her wake. '
Now, with Dark End of the Street — EP,
‘Cat Power brings out the soul, taking
some ’60s classics by Aretha Franklin

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

and Otis Redding, as well as the much-
covered rock song “Fortunate Son,” and
creating a calming an_d cohesive record.

The siX—song EP carries with it a
clear musical flavor: simple, yet com-
plex. With nothing more than Marshall’s
voice and a few ﬂeeting organ or gui-
tar notes to accompany her, she. does
not assail the listener with unnecessary
noise.

T   .Marshall's powerful purr darkens soul classics

pretations.

Upon hearing the first few bars of
James Carr’s “Dark End of the Street,”
listeners can relax into a time when mu-
sic was richer and more emotional. But

Cat Power’s style grounds you to the '

present music scene without the loss of
the music’s original concept.

The tempos remain slow and steady,
with the same instrumental accompani-

This simplicity leaves only her voice
and music for your quiet contemplation.
Cat Power’s slow and soulful songs fill
the empty spaces in your mind and make '
for restful sessions of your own inter-

ment throughout. Taking a page out of

the classic soul book that inspired her

covers, Marsh-all uses her backup to full
effect, never .leaving out a sound that
belongs in the mix. ’

Vocals are clearly the most impor-

' nor inhibited.

tant element to the general tone of the
record. Even the light and raspy note;.',‘\_i_
sound heavy against the sparse back-
ground of instrumental music. The
notes hold strong in front of piano and
strings or guitar and simple dru_mbeats.-
Her notes might come out in de-

lightful, melodic rasps, but Chan Margy.

shall never lacks for power or presence.
Instead, her muted tones intensify the
mood, with a style that’s neither abrasive

That soft power creates a balance be-
tween the sleepy tunes of the folk—influ—
enced and the deliberate hush of soul

‘style. Cat Power takes nothing for grant-

ed in ‘her melding of personal style and
well-established familiarity. _She makes
her inspirations known without her mu-
sic feeling forced or half—hearted. cf
Covers make for dicey territory for
musicians. For most, there would be
the potential for failure, of not living
up to the high, standards of the greats.
But with such clear originality showing
through another’s works, Marshall has
no fear. Covers can be hit or miss for an

artist, but for Chan Marshall, she’s hit ,

the mark, and they’re making her voice
sound loud and clear. You can’t deny

that she’s got style.

Taylor swiftly takes

by Tony Jovenitti
Staﬁ’ W/ritcr

Fearless

Taylor Swift
Big Machine Records
Rocks like: LeAnn,,_Rime‘s

She might not be able
to belt out that high note
to send chills down lis-
teners’ backs, but Taylor
Swift certainly can im-
press an audience with

her impeccable songwrit-

 

ing skills. She parades her amazing talent in .

her latest album, Fearkrr.
“You be the prince and I’ll be the princess

/ It’s a love story, baby, just say yes,” Swift_

sings in her first single, “Love Story.” The
songchronicles the relationship of Romeo
and Juliet, but she gives it a much happier
ending than the Shakespeare version. Two
songs later, though, Swift realizes that life isn’t
full of happy endings.

‘Tm not a princess, this ain’t a fairy tale /
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet /
and lead her up the stairwe ,” she sings emo-
tionally in “White Horse.” Fear/er: is full of

truths and realizations like this. “You’re so in love that you act insane,” she
Swift certain— confesses. h
ly doesn’t A have At the end of
pipes that can the album, in-
rival Carrie Un— stead of thanking
derwood or Mar— her family in the

tina McBride,
but through her‘ ‘

told on her previous self-titled album. “Tear-
drops on my Guitar” became a huge hit in
both the pop and country worlds two years
ago as Swift sang about a boy whom she loves
but only considers her a close friend. Fearless’
“You Belong \V1th Me” is a faster-paced,
more optimistic version of that experience.

After a fun acoustic intro, she sings about
this boy’s girlfriend not understanding him
like the narrator does.

“She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts /
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleach-
ers,” she sings in a knowing tone. “Dreaming
about the day when you wake up and ﬁnd /
That what you’re looking for has been here
the whole time.”

The most interesting song on the album
is easily “The Way I Loved You.” Swift sings
about her new boyfriend who is the perfect
gentleman. He opens doors for her, never
makes her wait, always calls and is close to
her parents. But Swift ﬁnally explains why
girls never fall for the nice guys.

Many musicians sing about tough rela-
tionships with the typical “bad boy” who is
nothing like a perfect gentieman. But Swift
ﬁnally manages to provide an explanation for
why girls stay in these relationships.

strates that Swift
doesn’t take any-

She sings about

much more ma-A
ture than her age suggests.

This is most apparent in the second track,
“Fifteen.” She sings about afreshman in high
school trying to {ind her identity. She man-
ages to paint the vulnerability of 15-year-old
girls with pinpoint accuracy.

“‘Cause. when. you’re 15_ and somebody
tells you they love you / You’re gonna be-
lieve them,” she sings in a mentoring manner.
“Well, count to 10, take it ir1 / This is life be-
fore you know who you’re gonna be.”

She even continues some of the stones

how her mother
protected her and
helped her grow into the successful woman
she has become.

“I have an excellent father  God shines
on my little brother  I grew up in a pretty
house and I had space to run,” she sings,
speaking about her upbringing in a nice
neighborhood near Reading,‘ Pa.

Swift’s second album has several potential
hits, thanks to her immaculate songwriting. If
she can write songs of this caliber after living
only 18 years, just imagine what’s in store for
the future.

Top 10 lists are an unquestionably supe-
rior form of writing. What other format so
quickly and effectively disseminates infor-
' C mation with little—to—no explanation, context
is oreffort? V
With memories of 2008 quickly fading
. m from our increasingly ADD—crippled minds,
_ if it’s time now for every opinionated movie-
.~ goer — and I’m told there are many — to
if K condense an entire year’s worth of judgment
"0. , into an easily digestible countdown. Not
  knowing which critic’s top 10 list is the most
 4" reliable, I chose to avoid the professional
opinions this year and read only the lists cre-
ated by people on my Facebook friends list.
H What I’ve learned is that “Sex and the
, City” might have been the third best movie
i of 2008. It managed to beat out “Batman,”
_ i which was “way to [sic] boring,” and “Harry
 Potter and the Half—Blood Prince,” a movie
, that has not yet been released. Another list
i suggests that “Zack  Miri Make a Porno”
_, is approximately four movies better than
 “Slumdog Millionaire.”
I Though it would be childish of me to call

   
     
  
   
  
  
  
  

Top 10 lists deﬁne what's worth re-
membering and what isn't. It's espe-
cially helpful today, when constant
bloggingfosters nostalgia for things
that happened 48 hours ago.

“these opinions stupid (though I’m sure I’ll
do it anyway), they are certainly uninformed.
That is, these aren’t so much “Top 10 mov-
_ ies of 2008” lists as they are “Top 10 movies
‘ 7 out of the ones I actually saw in 2008”_lists.
7 ,‘;It’s the difference between “I see movies like
: ‘it’s my job” and “I see movies because it is
my job. Seriously, I saw like ﬁve movies this
week.” ' e

Still, there is something to be said about
the commitment and credentials that accom-
pany professionalism — that is, someone
craving informed political analysis might be
better suited to read an issue of Newsweek
l than to consult the captain of a high school
I debate team.
T !' Unfortunately, lists like the ones in ques-
’ i “ tion are imperfect by design. Film, like other
art forms, is not governable by quantitative
_ judgment. There are no scorecards, only
I M V opinion. And while this caveat has accompa-
,_',,nied every subjective review of every piece
“of artwork ever, the top 10 list encourages
thoughtlessness.

Reel ‘fall: with 'I'om

Does it damage the credibility of 
criticism to declare which movie is “better”
than another? No. Nor does it purport to
be infallible or even relevant. That being the

case, though, it seems a ridiculous thing to '

take seriously —— or to take at all, for that
matter. '

Yet people do, and they demand it. The
top 10 format is popular — Time.com has
50 this_year, with everything from movies to
oddball news stories. You can imagine my
disappointment that “Virgin Shark Moth-
er” was only the fourth “oddballiest” news

 

story of 2008, though I’m sure “Virgin—born
Shark Cures Shark Lepers” will top the list
in 2009.

People like top 10 lists because they de-
ﬁne what’s right and wrong, what7s worth
remembering and what isn’t. It’s especially
helpful today, when constant blogging and
shows like “Best Week Ever” foster nostal-
gia for things that happened 48 hours ago.

While it isn’t breaking news that everyone
has an opinion, the still—booming popular-
ity of networking on sites like Facebook
and YouTube has made all these opinions

The Littman Test

by Adam Littman

   

It was another solid year for sports in
2008, but allow me to let you in on a se-
cret and tell you 2009 is going to be much
better.

I have no doubts about this, mostly be-
cause I built a time machine, went to 2010
and studied up on the past year just for you
ﬁne people. Not to bore you, but the time

machine was fairly simple to build. All you
need are a seat, the canned screams of a
unicorn, some metal, a poorly constructed
American ﬂag that has 15 stripes and nine
stars, pedals and Superman.

So enjoy, as I completely ruin the up-
coming year of sports for you.

The Detroit Lions enjoy a bounce—back
year after trading the No. 1 overall pick in
the NFL Draft to the Dallas Cowboys for
Terrell Owens. What the rest of the league

wasn’t aware of was that Lions owner \Wil-
liam Ford perfected human cloning, and
he clones TO. This new TO, Terrence
Owens, plays quarterback, only throwing
to the original TO.

Toward the end of the season, Ford
gets greedy and clones TO again, creat-

ing another receiver, Ted Owens. Ted and

Terrell eventually complain because there
aren’t enough passes to go around, and
they ﬁght to the death. They tie. Terrence

then leads the Lions past the Cowboys
in the playoffs because Tony Romo only
completes five passes —- all to Lions’ play-
ers — the entire game. _

Tiger Woods comes back stronger than
ever, mostly because instead of rehabbing,
he undergoes a surgery that makes him
one-third robot.

Sean Avery is named commissioner of
the NHL after everyone realizes he’s the
only hockey player who gets the league any

kees try to do something nice by buying -

the Washington Nationals. They will move

   

the Nationals to the Dominican Republic,
where after every home game, fans are in-
vited to run the bases, take batting practice
and throw off the mound.

Those who excel then get to take a.

physical, give their autograph and move to
Staten Island.

Just kidding about that earlier one. Lots
of professional athletes are arrested.

wedding dress.

playoff system, claiming, “Uh, yeah, sorry
about that. Trying to sit through that game
made us see the light, and seriously, our
bad. Wow, just yeah. Sorry.”

So there you have it. It’s like the ESPY’s~,- »

but in_print form and entertaining.

Hope you enjoy your 2009 sports year,

and one more thing: I know it’s shocking,
but trust me. When betting on this year’s

Scripps National Spelling Bee, take the un— _
