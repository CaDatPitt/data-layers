Eric Stonestreet, who plays Cameron Tuck-
er on the ABC sitcom “Modern Family,” le_ft
Pitt students wondering if they’d see him at
Peter’s Pub, Hemingway’s or Mi Ranchito
on Tuesday night.

After an audience member asked Ston-
estreet to go out after the show with her
and her friends, he asked the audience
which bars Pitt students usually frequent,
adding that he’d have to try them all.

Stonestreet hugged it out and took self-
ies with Pitt students in a ﬁill William Pitt
Union Assembly Room, answering ques-
tions from the audience throughout the
Pitt Program Council—sponosored event.
Above all, Stonestreet was honest.

“Most of you probably think I’m going
to tell you that you’re going to be successful

o

in life,’’ he said while chuckling. “Most of _

you probably will not be.”

Though he covered some serious topics,
Stonestreet kept the tone of his discussion
lighthearted, like a stand-up comedy per-
formance. After poking fun at two students
who left a few minutes into his Q-and-A
session, Stonestreet answered questions
about his favorite members of the “Modern

Family” cast, lifegrowing up in Kansas
and what it is like to play a homosexual
character as a heterosexual man. _
“People always ask, ‘Did your parents
think it was weird that you play a gay char-
acter?”’ he said. “First of all, that is such

an offensive question. I never approached .

Cam from the beginning as a‘ gaycharacter,
just as a person. Your sexuality doesn’t get
to deﬁne you.” '
Stonestreet said Jesse Tyler Ferguson,
who plays his on—screen partner, Mitchell

Pritchett, is his closest friend on the cast of ,

Modern Family and that he hopes they rep-
resent the gay community in a good light.

Lindsy Steinberger, incoming Pitt Pro-
gram Council lecture director and junior
psychology major, said that “Modern Fam-

” £6‘

ily is such a progressive show that almost

‘everyone watches,” and said before the

event that “[Stonestreet] really wants to
immerse [Pitt] students in his story.”

His story started on a farm in Kansas,
much like his character, Cameron, a Mis-
souri farm boy.

“I’ve had my whole arm inside a cow
before,” he said. 5‘-I’ve castrated hogs. And
my parents have the best table at IHOP in
Kansas City.”

After moving from Kansas City to Chi-

Jawbone, a company that specializes in de-

Martin saidthe $149 band syncs periodi-

steps, distance traveled and pace during the

Accordingto Gwendolyn Smith, the direc-

algorithms to track usem’ steps, distance,

“The UP app then calculates calories

Nites said the Board will “continue
to work diligently to address and take
the proper steps to provide solutions
[to] these common problems that SGB
faces every year.” '

“We ﬁrmly believe that no criticism
should go unnoticed,” he said.

Board member Andrew Abboud said

‘that when he and_ the other Board mem-

bers began their term injanuary of this
year, the Board members made changes
to SGB policies. Abboud said that the
Board voted to overhaul the SGB Code of
Ethics and repeal the‘2013 Media Policy.
The Board also decided to publicly vote
on its own budget and make that budget
available for students to access on the
SGB website. . _

“We decided collectively that'we
wanted to prove to the student body
that we are a team holding ourselves to
the highest level of accountability and
transparency,” Abboud said.

Board member Abby Zurschmit
added that the Board also established

a stricter attendance policy for Board /

members. .
“The expectation became that [for]
an elected representative of the entire
student body, SGB will become first
priority over all other extracurricular
commitments,” Zurschmit said.

Board member Graeme Meyer added"

that the current Board re—established
mandatory one-on-one sessions be-
tween Nites and Board members to
discuss project updates.

Board member Sara Klein said that
before the changes to the Allocation
Manual that the Board voted on last
week, the Board met with Student Af-
fairs Afﬁliated Groups to discuss how
the changes made to the Allocations
Manual would affect the student groups.‘

“We will continue to keep student
organizations involved in the Alloca-
tions Manual revision process before
making any ﬁnal revisions,” Klein said.

Nites concluded the Board’s an-
nouncements by acknowledging" the
flaws in'SGB’s system.

“However, we are here to make
changes and to ﬁx the problems we face,”
Nites said.

your craft is to be in a place where you can

Hollywood has its own impact on the

-actor. -

The biggest issue he takes with Holly-

‘ wood is how it treats hisfriend, Soﬁa Ver-

gara, who plays Gloria Delgado-Pritchett
on “Modern Family.” Vergara’s character,
Gloria, is often portrayed as a vain, air-
headed and attractive woman, traits that
have contributed to the public’s perception

of her real-life persona.

“_Soﬁa is an incredible person,” Ston-

reduce her to how beautiful she is because
she is honestly 10 times as smart as she is
beautiful.”

Mya Hogan, outgoing Pitt Program

A statement from Chancellor  Mark A. Nordenberg

Bomhtbreezt suspect moved to ‘supervised residential control’ in Ireland

During the spring of 2o12,lthe Pittsburgh
campuswent through a particularly dis-
ruptive period, wheri it was victimized by
a series of bomb threats. ‘ In dealingﬂwith
those threats, the safety of all members of
the campus community was the top priority
for the University. Of course, that also was
true before those threats were received and
has been true for the nearly two years that
now have passed since those threats ended.

Like everyone else who had the chance
to observe the collective reaction of those

- most directly affected — particularly the

responses of our students‘ — I remain proud
of the strength, resiliency, and-selﬂess-
ness that regularly were on display as we
moved through that time of crisis. What
easily could have become a divisive and
even more disruptive experience, triggered
by realinconvenience and understandable
anxiety, instead produced new and lasting
communitybonds that are reﬂective of the

commitment that we have to the University
and to each other. e

A I am writing now to advise you that there .

has been a recent development regarding
Adam Busby, the individual indicted as the

‘ person responsible for sending the emailed.

messages that threatened Pitt. Mr. Busby

- had been incarcerated in Ireland, while

facing a number of charges and extradition
requests. However, the Irish court system

- has authorized his transfer from prison .

— to what is termed “supervised residential
: control.” Essentially, he now is living in a
f hostel on terms that are designed to restrict
both ‘his movement and his access to the
 Internet. .
i We were advised of this development by
" the United States Attorney and represen-
 tatives of the FBI. As those who were on
 this campus two years ago will recall, law
enforcement professionals from the U.S.
I Attorney’s Office and the FBI, working with

City of Pittsburgh police and representa-
tives from other law enforcement agen-
cies, provided invaluable assistance during
that challenging time, and everyone who
beneﬁted from their help remains deeply
grateful. And as would be expected, federal

law enforcement remains actively engaged ‘

in seeking the extradition of Mr. Busby to
this country so that he can be prosecuted on
the charges arising out of the threats to Pitt.
,To be clear, we do not expect a recur-
rence of the 2012 situation. However, we
know that vigilance and preparation are
important aspects of a_safe community.
Therefore, I wanted to advise you of this‘
recent development. In doing so, let me
also remind you that the professionals of
the Pit police department have received
extensive training and are experienced in
dealing with a wide range of threats. The
University also has established response-
procedure protocols, developed an effec-

tive emergency notiﬁcation system, and
built important technological capacities,
including tools that enable us to remotely
monitor unfolding events and to secure
at‘—risk facilities. ' ’

C As noted above, Pitt has not stood alone
in addressing such security issues, either
during the bomb—threat siege or after the
threats had ceased, and we continue to
work cooperatively and collaboratively

with other law ‘enforcement agencies as '

one key dimension of our ongoing focus on
safety. With the help of those agencies, we
will continue to monitor this situation. And_
to underscore my main message, none of
us expects a repeat of the disruptive threats
that were experienced two years ago. My
intent in informing you of this most recent
development, then, is not to alarm you, but
let you know of this changed circumstance
as part of ongoing efforts to ensure that we

_all remain alert and prepared. I

the Cardinals in the National League Division
Series, the city’s pride for the Buccos ﬁnally re-
turned after more than two decades of losing
seasons. That pride has returned once again
with the start of baseball season.

Despite such recent success, the prolonged
losing streaks of smaller-market teams, such
as the Pirates and Kansas City Royals, reflect a
disadvantageous trend across the league over
the past 25 to 30 years.

The trend reﬂects an increasing inequity
between team payrolls, which have grown
enormously since the late 1980s. A 2009
Bleacher Report analysis states that during
the 1988 season, the New York Yankees and
Chicago White Sox possessed the highest and
lowest payrolls, respectively. The difference

between the two clubs equalled $13 million
dollars —. a 320 percent disparity between the
league’s largest and smallest payrolls.

In 1998, however, the gapwidened to $61.2
million: a765 percent difference between the
Baltimore Orioles and the Montreal Expos.
By 2008, the imbalance had grown to $187
million, with the Yankees possessing a 959
percent advantage over-the Florida Marlins.

In recentyears, the MLB has made efforts
to combat this grossly growing inequity, most
notably through the competitivebalance tax,

' or luxury tax. Essentially, it’s a tax placed on
the amount of dollars exceeding a certain »

threshold agreed to in the most recent collec-
tive bargaining agreement. So, for instance,
the threshold for the 2014-2016 seasons is
currently set at $189 million. If ateam’s payroll

«exceeds this number, it will be progressively

taxed on the amount exceeded, with more

‘ penalties added for repeat offenders.

Despite its efforts, the luxurytax is not ef-
fective and appears only as a stopgap measure
to the real problem: the lack of a league salary
cap. If put in place, the cap would curtail the

terribly disproportionate ﬁnancial advan— A
tages of larger market teams over smaller
ones, as again made obvious duringthis year’s
offseason-. '

...'_The Yankees unsurprisingly signed more A-

This ﬁitilegreality of currentpayroﬂ ‘

policy remains evident  2014.; The Los An-« 
geles Dodgers stand at the top of the league A
with a $23S,2§5§?i19 payroll compared to the

544,174. Buccos remairfrelatively 
low on the list as well, coming in at 27th out}:
of 30 teams with $78,111,667." 5 
These statistics and the unceasing dorni—

nance of large market teams that follows
only insinuate that alternative action must be
taken. A salary cap, which would place a limit

on the amount of money teams can spend 1

on players’ salaries, should be adopted and

_  implemented in orderto achieve the parity of
foﬁtliree years, $45 million; catcher  
 for ﬁve years, $85 million; center 
ﬁelder]acobyeE-llsbury for seven years, $153 8 11

other professional sports leagues such as the
NFL and NBA. Importantly, parity should be

_ focused on opportunity rather than results.

No matter how fair and equal payrolls
and policies are, results will vary and will not
equate to all teams ﬁnishing .500 or mak-
ing the playoffs, let alone the World Series.
Rather, if a salary cap were in place, teams
would earn the chance to be rewarded for the
depth of their abilities, rather than the depth
of their pockets. ‘

Most importantly, a salary cap could be

greatly beneﬁcial to fans; Itwould lowerlabor -

costs because many salaries could not remain
as astronomically high as they are now.

The -Pitt men’s baseball team scratched and
clawed, but when the ﬁnal out was recorded
on a warm and breezy Tuesday evening at
Charles L. Cost “Field, the Panthers were on

. the short end of a 6-4 decision against the

rival West Virginia Mountaineers;
“Obviously we were disappointed by the
outcome today,” Panthers head coa_chJoeJor-
dano said; “Our whole focus has been keeping
things simple, and we didn’t dothat today.
And when you’re playing a quality team like

West Virginia, those things are gonna come , 

back to bite you.”

The Panthers’ mistakes proved to be costly
early, as the Mountaineers (16-8) jumped onto
the scoreboard ﬁrst. 4 1

West Virginia center ﬁelder Bobby Boyd,

who led the game off with aline-drive double "

into right—center ﬁeld, scored on a wild pitch

by Pitt freshman starting pitcher T._]. Zeuch »

only run to score over two innings, as the

Mountaineer’s southpaw starterjohn Means .

them to one hit through the ﬁrst two frames.

By the end of the second inning of Pitt soft-

" ba1l’s double—header against Robert Morris,

Tess Apke and Nicole Sleith had already
made the Colonials fans feel conﬁdent.
Apke, a junior right ﬁelder, drovein a

I run in the ﬁrst, two more in the second,
and Sleith, a junior left-handed pitcher,

had allowed just one hit through the first
two frames.
After the inning break, Pitt trailed 2-0,

' and the public address announcer at Van-

abedian Field called for a vote, asking fans

to cheer for one of three songs that would

play later in the game. _ A
' Song one, Michael Jackson’s “Beat It,”

garnered no response from the 123 in at-

tendance. The infectious, seemingly om-
nipresent “Timber” by ‘Ke_$ha elicited a l

single shriek. The even more infectious
and deﬁnitely omnipresent “Happy” by
‘Pharrell Williams drew the overwhelming
applause of a group of ﬁve Robert Morris
supporters. ' ' A

But, they had reason to be happy.

Throughout the rest of the contest,
Apke and Sleith continued to appease the
Colonials (15-15) and their fans, leading
to a 6-2 victory in seven innings over the
Panthers in the ﬁrst game of Tuesday af-
ternoon’s doubleheader. Rédshirt sopho-
more inﬁelder Maggie Sevilla said Sleith
presented a tough matchup.

“S1eith hits really good spots, and she

has a really nasty changeup,” Sevilla said.
“She does not walk people, so she doesn’t
throw many balls, and she throws hard.
She’s a pretty controlling pitcher, and she
did a pretty good job with us.” .
Conversely, thefront end of the eve-
ning was one to forget for Pitt (11-15) and

junior right—hander Savannah King. In just‘

10 pitches, King allowed a leadoff single to
Jordan Gurganus, a single to Ashley Ger-
hart, ‘Apke’s double off the right ﬁeld wall
and another single to Samantha Santillo.
King said she knew something was off,
but wasn’t able to solve her ineffectiveness.
“It just wasn’t happening,” she said.

“And I know I didn’t come out on my game, '

and I let it affect me.“ V
King (6-11) failed to record an out in

_ a

breeze past Panthers in double-header opener

two runs — all of which was enough to
give her a loss.
E Of course, a two—run deﬁcit isn’t insur-
mountable, b_ut the Panthers struggled to
ﬁgure Sleith out, as she added deception to
her delivery by slapping her glove against
her leftthigh in the windup, then off her
right hip upon release.

. But the delivery failed to fool one Pan-
thér: ﬁrst baseman Carly Thea.

second and knocked in two with a home run
in the fourth inning. Thea’s blast, which

The displeasure was evident on Casey
Roche’s face, his expression after the
game ﬁxed in a grimace.

“I ﬂat out hate West Virginia. I don’t
like them at all,” Roche said, following
the Pitt baseball team’s second loss this
season to non—conference rival West
Virginia. “I’m real upset about it.”

Roche sat slouched near the dugout
railing after he and his fellow seniors

lost their ﬁnal chance to get the better _

At Charles L. Cost Field on upper
campus Tuesday night, people in at-
tendance saw, what used to be for many
around here, a common sight: the Moun-

in Morgantown, W.Va. — but Pitt faced
a similar fate this time as well, falling
6-4. The defeat ends a three—game win-
ning streak for the Panthers and gives
the visitors the season sweep.

_ The long—running series —— begin-
ning in 1939 with the first meeting of the
teams in what‘ Pitt considers its “modern
era” —— has avoided becoming a casualty
of conference realignment, as seen in
football, men’s basketball and a number

of other sports. The coritiniiation ofthe V

baseball series this year stands out as
one of three instances in which Pitt var-
sity teams, which includes gymnastics
and wrestling, still face the Mountain-
eers during their inaugural season in
the ACC. The~»two institutions were Big
East members together beginningin
1991 — Pitt had joined in 1982 — but
then West Virginia left for the Big 12 in
the summer of 2012.

Part of the reason that the baseball

King bouncesback in Gam    e2 to earn   dominant fashion

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor -

Savannah King won’t admit it, but her mis-

erable outing in the ﬁrst game of a dou-

bleheader on Tuesday might have been a

blessing. ' 
Because King threw justlo pitches but

suffered the loss in her earlier start, the ju- 9

nior left-hander was able to take the mound
againjust more than two hours after pitch-
ing her way off it. _

“I should have just been able to pitch the
full ﬁrst game, but [Alexa Larkin] came in
and did a good job,” King said. “We didn’t
win, but I knew the second game I had to
come in and do it for my team.” ' 

Backed by Maggie Sevilla’s fourth—inn_ing

1 home run that highlighted an offensive ex— ‘

plosion, King bounced back in her second
start of the day to hold down Robert Morris

in a 9-1 win over ﬁve innings Tuesday eve-
ning, t__he second game of a doubleheader
at Vartabedian Field. A

“It was the approach, the mentality,”
junior Carly Thea said of the complete ef-
fort. “I think we got a little more ﬁght in
us. We just came at it better than we did 
the first game.” _ T 3
_,  Kin'gl(7-11) tossed a complete game victo-

Z ry, scattering three hits, four walks and one
‘ earned run across ﬁve innings. She added

four strikeouts in a determined effort that
she amounted to a chance for redemption.

“I was kind of like, ‘You betterprove
yourself right now because you looked like

V crap in the ﬁrst game,”’ she said.

For the ﬁrst two innings, though, the
Colonials starters continued to outduel
King. This time around it was senior left-
hander Geena Badolato, who surrendered
just one walk andstruck out four through

two frames.

The Panthers (12-15) fell behind in the
top of the third when outﬁelder Kristen
Gabelt cracked a double off the right-ﬁeld
wall, advanced to third on a sacriﬁce bunt
and completed her trip around the bases
after the next at-bat. Jordan Gurganus,
Colonials ﬁrstbaseman, laced a grounder
to Pitt freshman third baseman Katherine

Kramer, who ﬁelded the ball cleanly, but
hesitated before gunning the ball to the
catcher. Gabelt slid in safely ahead of Kath-
ryn Duran’s tag at home, and the Colonials
- jumped to a 1-0 lead. '

Although King had seemed to make the
necessary adjustments after Game 1, the
offense looked to be stuck in the doldrums.
Pitt responded in the bottom half of the
inning, though, exploding for ﬁve runs on
three hits and capitalizing on two errors by
Robert Morris (15-16).

Duran doubled to start the inning and

‘was promptly substituted on the bases for

sophomore inﬁelder Morgan Choe.

Sevilla said that double, paired with
some motivational words, was just about all
the Panthers needed to start picking up hits.

“We came out pretty slow, and we had
about six had at-bats,” she said. “Soone of
our captains pulled us aside and said, ‘Look,
we need to make an adjust'ment—.— either
move up [in thebox], get hit [by a pitch]
or ﬁnd a way to get on base. That’s what
Kathryn Duran did when she came up with
a big double.” I ’

After Ashlee Sills struck out swinging,
sophomore outﬁelder Tori N irschl reached
on an error by Robert Morris third baseman
Chelsea Siar.

could muster against Sleith, who ﬁnished
with four strikeouts and no walks while
allowing just ﬁve hits and two runs in a
complete game win.

Meanwhile, Apke continuedtorching
Pitt, collecting three more knocks against
junior left-hander Alexa Larkin in Game 1.
She went 4rfor-4 with a home run, three
RBI and two runs scored.

Apke crushed a two-run homer to center
in second, sending center ﬁelder Ashlee
Sills to the ground after she ran out of room

A and into the blue padded wall. Sills’ spill

was indicative of the entire contest: The
homer put the Panthers in a 4-0 hole after
two innings, and it was clear they had al-
ready fallen.

King said she wasn’t sure why Apke had
such an easy time all afternoon, but indi-
cated that the Colonials, who collected 13
hits, are a pesky bunch of hitters.

“They aren’t really good with their me-

chanics,” she said. “But they’re just ready
to swing at whatever is coming their way,
and they do a good job of that.” V '
Larkin’s relief effort —— she pitched seven
innings with ﬁve strikeouts and allowed
nine hits, threewalks and four earned runs
— was critical to not only keeping the game
within reach, but also, to eating a game’s
worth of innings. Thea said she appreci-
ated the effort. ' .
“We came out a little rough, but some-

times that’s going to happen and why we ~

have multiple pitchers -— to come in and
‘help each other ou ,°” she said. “The ﬁelders
will be there to pick each other up, and we’ll
do our best to support our pitcher and back
each other up and just hope_that they’ can
come out on top.” V '

Unfortunately for Pitt, though, that
wasn’t the ultimate result.

Just before the Colonials’ two-run sixth
inning secured a Robert Morris victory,
Williams’ foot—tapping tune ﬁnally played
over the loudspeakers and one of the ﬁve
visiting fans bobbed along.

Clearly, they were still happy. I

on the mound to calm Badolato, knowing
the stage was.set for Sevilla, the reigning
ACC Player of the Week.

Sevilla waited patiently outside the right
batter’s box for the mound chat to adjourn.
Badolato got ahead with two quick strikes
on the Pitt second baseman, but Sevilla then
slapped an RBI single to right ﬁeld, forcing
Fannin to duck out of the way and scoring
Choe. 5 ' "

Thea followed with her own opposite-
ﬁeld RBI single, which scored N irschl and
gave Pitt its ﬁrst lead of the day. Carissa
Throckmorton then walked  the bases
loaded; and Badolato (2-10) was relieved by
Haileigh Stocks. V .

Kramer then smoked a grounder to short
that- was misplayed and brought another

. run home. ‘-

The ﬁve runs proved enough for King, V

who bargained with her teammates for this
result before the game. .

“The second game Itold my teammates I l

was ready to ﬁght for them, and I just wanted
another chance,” King said. “They fought
for me and made their adjustments at—bat,
and we mer_cied them in ﬁve.” A
Pitt added another four runs in the
‘fourth inning, two of which were scored on
Sevilla’s line-‘drive home run, which clanged
off the scoreboard in left-center ﬁeld. The
blast was Sevilla’s seventh of the season,
which leads the team.

Sevilla is now 10 -for-20 (.500) with four
home runs, 12 RBI and nine runs in her last
six games, a span in which Pitt has won
four games. Her hot streak might be just

a Pitt player. '

It would be easy to look at the long pe-
riod of frigid weather that prevented Pitt
from playing games as a detractor, forcing
theplayers from getting into any kind of
routine. Sevilla, though, said that stretch
actually beneﬁtted her offense.

“The break really got me to focus on
my swing and my mechanics,” she said. “I
wasn’t hitting very well before I came into
this past weekend, and I think just getting
my mechanics right so that I can trust my
hands.” I

_l “I don’t think it’s as intense as "the old
basketball and football rivali'y,”_]ordano
said. “I think there’s a mutual respect,

and we’re going to continue [the tradi— -

tion] well- into the future.”

The teams hada two~game home—and-
home arrangement last season, too, but
an increased interest in this particular
game was evident in the stands.

Tuesday in Morgantown, W.Va., getting
creditedwith a no decision today and a
loss a week ago.

“It’s pretty intense,” the first year 2
‘player said of the-rivalry.

Although Pitt and West Virginia are
no longer conference opponents, the
competitionmaintains relevance as a

crucial chance to boost a resumé for the l

postseason —— something that isn’t lost
on Zeuch despite his lack of experience
within the rivalry. '

“This game is huge for us in terms of
our schedule,” he said. “Two wins against
a quality Big 12 team like West Virginia
would really help you out down the road.”

Pitt has had success in recent years
against its regional rivals, owning a 8-4
overall record and 3-1 home advantage
since 2010. '

That success echoed at the individual
level by Roche, who came into the game
against WVU hitting .357 for his career,
the highest average of his teammates.
The veteran continued that success Tues-
day, going 3-5 at bat with two RBI.

“I think anytime you play a rival, you
try to elevate your game,” he said.

This trend didn’t make this -loss or
