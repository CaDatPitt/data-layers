Meeting heated, tense

in the middle of a heated back- i

and-forth debate with state legis-

lators Monday, Chancellor Mark —

Nordenberg outlinedin detail for
the ﬁrst time which Pitt programs
would suffer drastic cuts if legisla-
tors pass a proposed budget that
would slice the school’s state fund-
ing in half.

Nordenberg outlined the po-
tential damage before the House

Appropriations Committee, voic- -

ing strong opposition to Republi-
can Gov. Tom Corbett’s ﬁrst state
spending plan. The chancellor’s
words reﬂected the tense environ-
ment brewing within the state’s
education community, where lead-
ers are worried that substantial

cuts could jeopardize the function I

of vital university programs. _
Gov. Corbett proposed the cuts

— which would result in a loss of

$900 million in state funding for

education -— earlier this month as
part‘ of a plan to bridge a $4 billion

a budget gap.fUnder the new spend-

ingplan, Pitt would receive about
$80.2 millionpfasiopposed to the
about $165 millipn itvreceived this
ﬁscal year. V b if V T .

_ The meetinggoriginally sched-
uled to run 90 minutes",« lasted four
hours. State representatives grilled

respect to short-term issues that.

might arise during the shift from
Gov. [Ed] Rendell’s administration
to Gov. Corbett’s administration.

‘ We were not given any role in the

development of longer-term bud-
get policies, and I had no special
insights into the governor’s budget
planning as a result of my mem-
bership on the transition commit-
tee.” '
When asked what he felt would
be a fair percentage for cuts, the
chancellor said, “It is far too early
to make a prediction with respect

V to the likely outcome.”

“As was indicated in the hear-

a ing,” he said, “we came out of this

year knowing our [federal] stimulus
funding was going to be lost. That
$7.5 million reduction we took as a
given. We really do believe we have
a strong case to make for Pitt, both
in terms of the people we’re serving
through educational programs and
the impact we’re having through
research and outreach efforts.”

Asked if there were any other
alternatives besides a tuition in-
crease, Nordenberg said Pitt’s Plan-
ning and Budgeting Committee was
brainstorming. .

“We will do everything we can to
help cushion the blow that our in-
state students in particular would
feel if cuts of this magnitude might
impose,” he said". But Nordenberg
maintained that there were real
challenges to this, and he’s already
said he’ll have to raise tuition next
year.

“To be clear, a public university
is able to maintain lower in—state
tuition rates only because the state
has chosen to invest in public high-
er education and to help subsidize

the cost that otherwise would be.

borne by in—state students. It is go-
ing to be a real challenge because
of that,” he said. I

University spokesmanjohn Fe-
dele later, conﬁrmed Nordenberg’s
report, but could not immediately
share more speciﬁc information
about exactly how much Pitt’s med-
ical school gets from thestate.

“This is a curtailment of servic-
es that are unique and meaningful,”
Nordenberg said.

Republican Rep. Jeff Pyle, who
serves on the appropriations com-
mittee, addressed, Nordenberg
near the end of the hearing with a
string of questions. He asked the"
chancellor whether it is common
for research institutions to patent

the cuts might effect Pitt’s regional
campuses.

Nordenberg‘ explained that
each of Pitt’s regional campuses
— Bradford, Greensburg, John-
stown and Titusville — are doing
“very well.” - ”

“We have no plans to retreat
from our commitment to our
[branch] campuses, but cuts at a
particular level require that you
look at all of your programs and
make decisions about places where
you can ﬁnd room to close your
budget gaps. Regional campuses
tend to be more vulnerable than

or copyright discoveries and what
Pitt does with the extra revenue
generated from such ﬁndings. -
Nordenberg said that it is com-
mon practice for research universi-
ties to patent discoveries, but that
the costs of conducting and pat-
enting research leaves little extra
revenue to devote to tuition.

“We have a policy that would
reinvest most of those dollars into
the research enterprise,” he said.

At the end of this exchange, Pyle
told the chancellor he had nothing
but respect for the UPMC Health
System, which saved his life in
2005 after removing a cancerous
kidney.

Republican Rep. Martin Causer,
who sits on the committee, also
questioned Nordenberg about how

He went on to compare Pitt’s

. regional campuses to nearby Carn-

egie Mellon -- which has locations
dispersed throughout the world
— explaining that CMU’s branches
campuses do not serve the Pennsyl-
vania economy like Pitt’s do.

By the end of the meeting, it
seemed that both the legislators
and university administrators
better understood each others’
positions.

Rep. William AdolphJr., Repub-
lican chair of the House Appropria-
tions Committee, concluded the
hearing by reminding everybody of
the amount of work that lay ahead
in determining a bipartisan solu-
tion on exactly how much to cut
‘from education. 

ANALYSIS .

Experts ‘examine,

effectiveness of activism -

john Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

By this point, most Pitt students have
heard aboutthe educationﬁmdingcuts
proposed earlierthismonthbyRepub-
lican Gov. Tom Corbett. p

An informal surveytakenlastweek
in Towers Lobby found that about 40
out of 50 student respondents were
aware that Pitt could lose more than
$80 million nextyear in state funding
as part of Corbett’s ﬁrst budget.

And though most students admit-
ted they didn’t follow the issue closely,
a high number said the potenﬁal cuts
worried them personally, especially if
it would mean any signiﬁcant tuition
hikesnextyear. ' .

These worries sparked signiﬁcant

reactions from some students across ’

the state in the form of protests, pe-

_ titions and letter-writing campaigns.

HereatPitt', manyofthe anti—cut initia-
tives have been lead by SGB President
Molly Stieber andthe Student Govern-
ment Board. Pitt’_s graduate student
government has also contributed sig-

. niﬁcantlytothe projects.

Their efforts have caught the atten-
tionand admiration ofsome legislators
a11dadministrators,buthaveled others
to question what effect students will
have on the lawmakers in Harrisburg
who, during the next few months, Will
decide ‘how much ofPitt’s $160 million
allocation to restore.

The sleeping giant?

The eighth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union is abusy place these days under
the direction of Stieber and the 2011
Board, much as it was under former
president Charlie Shull lastyear, when
students faced a different — and sig-
niﬁcantly less expensive——- ﬁmding

threat.

The infamous Fair Share Tax, which
PittsburghMayorLuke Ravenstahlpro-
posed lastyearto plugagap inthe city
budget, would have cost Pitt studentsa
share of just $15 million. The proposal
ultimately failed after coordinated
protests from both students and Pitt
administrators, who banded together
to voice opposition to hiking student
fees.

Today, the Pitt community _faces a
threat more thanﬁve times largerthan
the numerical value of the Fair Share
Tax, and the advocacy campaigns are

' once again rolling forward.
Perhaps chief among those initia- 4

tives  been SGB and GPSAs letter-
writing campaign and the Board’s
ongoing effort to, as Stieber likes to
put it, “share the personal side of the
education funding issue.”

At a meeting held last week about
student activism, Stieber stressed that

‘line of argument.

“Our administrators go to Har-
risburg all thetimeto speak with law-
makerstabout the numbers and per-
centages,” she said. “We as students
don’t have to do that. Our job is to be
a member of the Pitt community and
let them know how cuts will directly
impact our ﬁitures. We need to show
thatwe cane.” '

Despite the letter-writing cam-I‘

paign’s  success -— the groups

have gathered almost 400 personal-

ized letters so far — Stieber admitted
that convincing legislators to listen to
students won’t be easy. Student voter
turnout in Oakland typically falls in
well under 20 percent, and Corbett, a
Republican who campaigned on ﬁscal
c,on‘servatismandano~new-taxpledge,
didn’tdepend onthe studentvoteinhis
election victory in November.

Inthat election, 66 percent ofthose
who voted on campus opted for Cor-

Zombies now on the prowl for human ﬂesh

Tegan Hanlon
Stajf Writer

A human_walked down Thackeray
Avenue yesterday afternoon on the

lookout for two zombies he knew"

would be lurking around the area.
Unfortunately, he didn’t take enough
precaution.

Freshman Matthew Gargani
turned into a zombie after he was dou-
ble—teamed during Pitt’s serni-annual
Humans vs. Zombies game.

The game works like a complicated
version of tag: “Zombie” players at-
tempt to turn “human” players into
their own' kind, and the last human
standingwins.

Gargani was philosophical about
his early—game infection.

“I see one [zombie] and get ready Z
to stun her, then the other, who was-

hiding behind a car, runs around he-
hind me,” he said. “I am now a zom-
bie.” 4 A

The armual spring game started
up again last Sunday at noon., Three
of the more than 80 participants ran-
domly received e—mails generated

from the Humanvs. Zombies website
detailing their positions as “original
zombies.” Their mission: Devour as
many humans as possible.

Senior Jackson Sando, who has
been playing the game for four years,
wasone ofthethreeoriginal zombies.
With his hands as his only “weapons,”»

Sando said he plans to sit in Towers ‘

lobby from sun up to sun down —
about 8:30 am. to _3 am. —- during
the course of the game to taghumansp
and turn them into his species.

The infected zombies revealed
themselves to the University for the
spring game by tying their green,
purple or orange bandarma around
their forehead. Humans wear the
same article around their arms.

, The incubation period is a playoff
of zombie movies such as “Dawn of the
Dea ,” Sando said. When the epidemic
strikes the town, no one knows who is

infected until after the symptoms set '

in. When the incubation period ends,

the tell-tale signs of the zombie disease .

startto show, or— inPitt’s case—the
bandarmas come out.

Although humans are alerted that
the game has begun, during the incu-

bation neither the humans nor the
zombies are identiﬁed by their tell-
tale headbands. Humanswalkaround
in hyper-awareness, unsure who is a
zombie or if they’ll get infected.
Here are the basic rules of the

game:

Matthew Gargani:

found himselfweaponless, sittingbe-
hind two zombies in class.
“Thinking fast, he took off his
socks and stunned the zombies with
 socks on the way out,” Gargani
said.
Classrooms, along with dorm

I am now a zombie.

Zombies can tag humans. To
defend themselves, humans carry
around foam dart guns or bunched
up socks — preferably clean socks.‘
If humans see a zombie before they
are tagged, they can “stun them” by
hitting them with their “weapon.”
Struck zombies remain stunned for
15 minutes, allowing the human to
escape.

Sando compared the Humans vs.

- Zombies game to tag.

“It’s kind of like sharks and min-
nows, but the minnows can strike
bac ,”Sando said.

rooms and bathrooms, are considered
“safe places,” as are Market Central
and a few other high-traffic campus
spots.

Humans carryaround three iden-
tiﬁcation cards with theirID numbers
printed on them. When humans are
tagged, they must hand over the three
cards to their killerzombie. The zom-
bie then logs on to the Humans vs.
Zombies website and plugs in the
kill.

“A human’s ﬂesh is supposed to
feed three zombies,” Sando said.

The zombie can give the two ad-

ditional cards he receives from his

victim to his zombie friends who are
close to starvation. A zombie must
capture a human every 48 hours to
avoid starving to death.

Humans also use the Humans vs.

‘Zombies website to stay alive. Senior

Amanda Aninwene said humans have
to log on to a campus computer to re-
stock their resources and supplies. If
humans fail to restock supplies every
two days, they die and are out of me
game.

Aninwene noticed that she was
running out of supplies yesterday
morning. “I need to tell my friends
to go to the computer lab right now,”
she said. ‘

Pitt Humans vs. Zombies presi-
dent RobertYounger said the website
allows the ofﬁcers to check that stu-
dents are staying on campus and not
hiding out in their rooms.

The ofﬁcers of the informal club
playakey roleinthe game. They setup
“missions” for humans and zombies
to promote interaction between the
two groups.

Childhood board game “ era-
tion” made an appearance in the ﬁnal
mission of the last year’s Humans vs.

bett’s Democratic opponent, Allegheny County
Executive Dan Onorato, who received 478 of the
717 votes cast here.

During the Towers survey last week, one stu-
dent cited that fact when criticizing the SGB ef-
forts, saying, “Lawmakers‘aren’t worried about
offending students because stu_clents don’t vote.
We have no power because we don’t.”

Other students voiced similar concerns
throughout the week. A few of the more politi-
cally savvy reported feelingworried that student
appeals couldfallondeafears becauseavastmajor—
ity ofDemocrats inthe state House, alongwith no
small number ofRepublicans, already oppose the
proposed cuts to education spending.

Theyfeltthat, with Pitt’s administration push-

ingso hard, some feltthere is little for students to’

do but sit and wait with ﬁngers crossed.-
The (all to action

Stieberthinksthat’s aridiculous pointofview.
So does Pitt’s Vice Chancellor of Governmental
Relations Paul Supowitz, who serves as one ofthe
University’s chieflobbyists to Harrisburg.

Supowitz joined Stieber at SGB’s advocacy fo-
rum last week, ﬁelding student questions about
the most effective ways to impact the ongoing
budget battle. He also stressed the importance
of “personalizing the issues.”

“What the legislators are going to listen to is

the story of the ﬁrst—generation college attendee
who won’tbe able to afford any substantial tuition

hikes,” he said. “Or the story of a biomedical sci- .

ence student gettingatopquality education fora
public school price.”

While Supowitz spoke, one student raised his
hand and asked why the personalization is so ef-
fective. .

“Because the legislators, 1il<ethe rest ofus, are

just people and are subject to the same concerns
as the rest of us. There’s no magic here. These are
folks like you and me,” he said.

Sofar, both Republican and Democratic mem-
bers ofthestate Senate Appropriations Committee
have agreed that student inputwill play a signiﬁ-
cant role in the legis1ature_’s budgetary calculus.

State Senate Appropriations Committee Chair
Jake Corman, a Republican from Centre County,
Pa., commended the work SGB and studen

‘The personal element oﬂegislationcanhave

who represents thousands ofPenn State students.
“I think any time you get off the raw facts and
personalize your complaint, that’s going to have
a strong effect on lawmakers.”

But another legislator on the Senate Appro- I

Ferlo called for more aggressive action from
students, sharply criticizing Corbett’s proposed
budget.

“The letter campaigns are ﬁne. They are
good, but nothing can beat aggressive, in—your—
face activism,” he said. “Students need to travel

So far, so good

Franl<lin&Marshall College professorG. Terry
Madonna, who offers political commentary for
major news outlets like the New York 'I‘imes,,
agreed with both Stieber’s and Corman’s assess-
ments thatstudents arealreadyhavingabigimpact

“We haven’tseen suchaconcerted eifortfrom
students in more than 30 years,” he said. “I’ve
personally been impressed by the seriousness

' of purpose and the sophistication of arguments

presentedby students, and I thinka lot oflegisla—
tors have been impressed too.”

Madonnawas quickto add that the news isn’t
allgood for students. _

“Ofcourse, we’re on_the verystartof a new elec-
tion cycle, so it’s unlikely that legislators sympa-
thetictothe cutsareworried that students are go-
ingto unite andvote them out of oﬂice. That could
reduce the protests’ effectiveness,” he said.

But overall, Madonna agreed with the senti-
ment that lawmakers have so far been open to
the education cause.

“I don’tthinkthe 50 percentcutswillsurvive,”
he said. “We might see 25 percent, but even that
would be draconian. I would guess more in the

Market Central, Towers prime zombie feasting spots

Zombies 4 3

Zombies game. The oﬂicers saw that the humans
looked like they were about to come out on top,
so they had one human try to complete a game
of Operation while his fellow humans defended
him from the zombies.

“It didn’t work well,” Younger said. “Little did
we know he had nerves of steel and completed
it in less than a minute.”

The particular human not only proved suc-
cessfulinhis mission, which he received through
the Humans vs. Zombies website, but the human
population overruled the zombies in the last
game. Younger said the officers have ‘not yet
decided on the missions for this game, but the
ﬁrst one should run latethisweek. They typically
run a mission every two to three days.

Current participants said the Humans vs.
Zombies game revolves around strategy and
creates high anxiety for student participants.

Freshman nursing studentjesse Wool said
he signed up after hearing his Pathﬁnder tour
guide mention the game.This is his second time

playingthe game. .
“Humans vs. Zombies is not for the faint of
heart,” Wool said.

Wool participated in the game last semester
and remembers the time hisﬂoormate attempted
to tag him in his hallway dormitory.

“One of the guys on my ﬂoor got tagged by
an OZ [original zombie] in the second day,” he
said. “I knew this, so when I was on my ﬂoor
and he started walking toward me, I shot him
in the chest with my nerf gun. Another zombie
then came sprinting around the circle, hurdled
him and tagged me.”

It is common for zombies to travel in pairs.
Original zombie Sando said the zombies in the
game are oﬂen extreme strategists, trading cell

- phone numbers so they can meet up and prey

on unsuspecting humans. g
“Therearetwo types ofzombies,”Sando said.

“Some zombies are intelligent and agile, while
others are suipidand slow — the zombie walk.
In this game, we want to be the smart ones.”

Humans have to be on the constant lookout
for these cunning zombies — Towers Lobby
is a deﬁnite no—no for humans hoping to stay
alive. '

“As ahuman you constantly scan for zombies,
and when you are a zombieyou search for the
armbands,” Wool said. “I could spot orange from
200 meters away in a crowd in the fall.”

Sophomore human Isaac Haddad said he

tries to limit his movement to inside and around
his dorm and academic buildings —— all human
safe—havens.

He noted that Market is in fact a safe place,
however exiting and entering Market is where
problems arise. '

“When zombies know humans are inMarket,
groups will just stand outside of the entrance
and wait,” he said.

Younger said that the club alerts the police
prior to the event to eliminate potential prob-
lems in advance.

The only established rule for the game is
“DBAD,” or “Don’t Be a Dick.”

“Basically, you can always dispute about be-
ing hit or not,” Sando said. “You have to think
— would the situation get better if I gave in? It’s
just a game, strictly recreation .”

One side, humans or zombies, are expected
to prove victorious by the end of the week. With
currently74 humans and11zombies,ﬂ1e humans
have high hopes.

“I think humans will win. We have some

it does no one any good. V
As state governments across
the country (including Pennsyl-

I t’s a great thing to have pas-

‘ vania) continue to respond to

budget pressures by proposing
cuts to higher education, col-
lege students are seriously —
and rightfully —— agitated. Cut-
induced tuition hikes seem like
the last thing students need to
deal with as they prepare for an

It makes sense to raise.your voice
—— either literally or electroni-
cally —— and it makes sense to
be mad. No one will stop you —
passionate expression of dissent
at the steps of state capitols is a
healthy, inalienable exercise.
But don’t be fooled. However

many signs and megaphones you

arm yourself with in the com-
ing months, you shouldn’t forget
about the weapon you chose not
to pick up, what would have been
the most important cause to your

name — the vote.

CBS News reported last year
that only 9 percent of young peo-
ple aged 18 to 29 showed up _to the
polls in the 2010 midterm elec-
tion. This was the election that
swept Republican governors and
legislative majorities into state
governments, the policymakers
from which higher education cuts
have largely stemmed. Pennsyl-
vania Gov. Tom Corbett heads
only one of many Republican-led
and cut-friendly states — oth-
ers include Minnesota, Nevada,
Idaho and Michigan.

2008 ascension of former first-
term Sen. Barack Obama to the
White House is a case—in—point. In
that regard, if youth participation
in the 2010 midterms would have
deviated only slightly from 2008
levels instead of plummeting as it
did, who knows what would have
happened? But alas, the reality is
that weskipped voting day, and
it’s no wonder that the state gov-

Although it’s important to un-
derstand how we got ourselves
here, letting that realization
deﬂate our plans to protest the
higher education cuts would be
self-defeating. Students of state
and state-related schools might
have negligently left the fate of
their education hanging danger-
ously close to the Republican
budgetary ax, but let us not de-
ﬁne stupidity by welcoming the
blade with open arms of silence
and stoicism. The music is far
from over, but we’re certainly
dancing without legs. I

Retiring Boomers to enjoy undeserved fruits

Get ready for a generation war: Underpaying Baby Boomers will be forcing innocent children into debt obligations

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Everybody loves to believe that a
secret person or group is running
the country. The Left likes to believe
it is wealthy industrialists — shady
ﬁgures who dole out campaign cash
to buy judges and legislators. The
Right would have us believe that it
is unions and the media who are co-
horts in a scheme to direct policy.

But as intriguing as these theo-
ries are, neither side wishes to re-
veal the true puppet masters a the
elderly and soon—to-be elderly. It is
Mabel from Mobile, Ala., and Ezra
from Bethesda, Md., who actually
direct policy in this country, both
through organized lobbying groups
like AARP and by sheer voting pow-
er. And while it isn’t like the elderly
don’t deserveto be cared for, their
power and well-being comes at the
cost of our future prosperity.

A quick overview of the num-
bers shows how this power has been
transformed into state and federal
budgets: About 9 Percent of our
gross domestic product consists of
entitlement payments to the elderly,
according to the Congressional Bud-
get Ofﬁce, while roughly 5 percent

~ of GDP goes to children.

Now it isn’t that spending more
on the elderly is necessarily a bad
thing: Health care is expensive,
after all. Plus, the whole concept
of spending extra actually works
very nicely in the halls of policy
schools, where politics don’t inter-
vene. Working adults just sacriﬁce
some of their present earnings to
provide support for people in these
groups — young and old —— who
either can’t or don’t earn income

themselves. For Americans, these
payment vehicles are property taxes
to go toward schools and'payro1l
taxes to go toward senior care.
When everybody pays as they

. should, everybody ends up breaking

even. Nobody unfairly beneﬁts, and
nobody unfairly pays.

An example of fair payers, our
grandparents — whose lavish re-
tirement programs are the envy of
many — paid substantial property

taxes (called FICA) and redirects
that money to provide beneﬁts to
the retirees currently tapping into
the program. This is called a “pay-
as—you—go” system. Given its sepa-
ration from Congress, the SSA can
run a surplus — more FICA revenue
thanoutlays — at the same time

the rest of the government is riding I

a budget deﬁcit, and this scenario
roughly describes the period from

1984 until 2010.

yearly budget deﬁcits can pay off
these IOUs is to borrow even more
money. Thus, if Congress runs a high
budget deﬁcit, paying off its debt to
the SSA would require Congress to
raise the deﬁcit and, in the long run,
the national debt. So if presidents
pass tax cuts and correspondingly
reduce government revenues, to
ﬁilﬁll Social Security promises to

- retirees, the tax cuts will push sub-

stantial debt burden onto future

Because this population  likely not be 
willfully forgoing payments, the gburdenwillfall
on two groups: children and young adults.

taxes to fund the education of the ‘

people who would eventually be
providing for their own retirement
(in terms of Social Security), accord-
ing to a Brookings Institution study.

They paid fairly, and thus, paying"

for their retirement hasn’t been so
difficult. T ’ V .  «

The Baby Boomers, however,
enjoyed lower property taxes with-
out such a large school—age popula-
tion, and they didn’t invest in their
own retirement by paying income
taxes.

How does higher income-tax
revenue bolster a generation’s abil-
ity to retire? By lowering budget
deﬁcits.

To see how this works, its im-
portant to ﬁrst understand that the
Social Security Administration op-
erates as an institution completely
separated from Congress..During
a given year, the SSA raises its own

So what has the SSAldone with
this 30-year accumulationof sur-
pluses? The short answer is that the
money was invested, and the trust
ﬁind that resulted is now a collec-
tion of $2.6'trillion worth of U.S.
Treasury bonds —— basically U.S.
government IOUs. -

You might ask yourself, “The

. government owing money to itself

— isn’t that crazy?” Well, while it
should be noted that U.S. govern-
ment debt is the safest asset known
to modern man, the paradoxical
debt relationship that is the Social
Security Trust Fund indeed poses
a problem. Speciﬁcally, what the
fund represents is $2.6 trillion of
liabilities, which only exist because
past Congresses ran deﬁcits of its
own. Once retireesstart substan-
tially tapping into the trust ﬁind -
which they are starting to do — the

only way a U.S. Congress that passes

generations.

Unfortunately for our genera-
tion, this is exactly what past ad-
ministrationsihave done. Kennedy,
Reagan and Bush all did what good
presidents of democracies do —

please the majority —.and de-

creased the share they would need
to contribute toward their own
retirements. To pay for their own
eventual retirements, theseadmin-
istrations should have been building
up huge funds or at least have been
heavily advocating private accounts
for individuals.

It is an ironic situation, almost:
Instead of our country being run by
secret minions out to suck money
out of the economy, it was run just
as it was intended. The majoritywas
placated, and now we have a gen-
eration without theftmds needed to
ensure a comfortable retirement.

The result is that soon—to-

be retirees are expecting their
parents’retirement beneﬁts without
paying as much. But because this
population will likely not be will-
fully forgoing payments, the burden
will fall on two groups: children and

young adults. . .

Children will be hurt because,
as a nonvoting population that
doesn’t exactly care about school
funding, young people" provide a de-

. mographic whose education spend-
ing can be sacriﬁced. Despite the -

fact that another Brookings Insti-
tution study shows that education
spending produces anywhere from
a 2-to-1 to a 17-to-1 return on invest-
ment — margins unheard of in the
stock market or real estate — the
beneﬁts are so long term, the trade
ofl'doesn’t seem that bad. This trend
is already revealing itself in state
capitals-across the country.

Finally, young adults will hurt
because, without a change in ben-
eﬁts, we will not only be paying for
our own retirements, but for the
interest of our parents’. Unlike the
nice model where there are‘no win-
ners and no losers, where everybody
ultimately ends up right where they
started, we will all be losers.

So I suppose there is something
to be optimistic about in this coun-
try: Democracy is pleasing the

' majority, just like it is supposed to.

Secret groups in high ofﬁces aren’t
running the government. The Baby
Boomer generation is, and its mem-
bers will enjoythe fruits of past gen-
erations’ thrift and our generation’s
labor. ,

Oddly enough, this fact about
our democracy isn’t comforting to
me.

Pitt seniors use parties to foster local music

Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

For several months last summer, two

Pitt students scavenged the streets of
Oakland in search of couches to tear
apart. The two were lookingtoﬁnd the

egg crate foam they needed to sound-

proof the walls of their basement to

host regular music nights.

Now the otherwise sparsely deco-
rated basement on Ophelia Su'eet has
patches of foam adorning its walls. In
the yellow glow ofthe mismatched light
ﬁxtures and naked bulbs, musicians
and bands from local colleges use the
space inanalcove asastage everyother
Thursday.

The home ofPitt seniors Ben Green-
wood and Lukas Truckenbrod has be-
come a meeting place for musicians, a
laboratory for style experimentation

spent a few hours down there and or-
ganized,” ’I‘ruckenbrod said.

The pair then began ripping apart
couches left out for trash to ﬁnd egg
crate foam to soundproof the walls,
something they think will be easy to
remove when they move out. Green-
wood said buying the same foam in a
store would have cost them up to $10
per square foot.

Bylast September, theywere ready
tohostamusic party and invited friends
through Facebook. Despite his excite-
ment, Greenwood, who is a member of
the band Sleepyv, admitted to having
some reservations about the parties.

“Fmalittle nervous usuallybefore it
starts because, on the one hand, what if
no one shows up? How embarrassing
would that be? And on the other hand,
what if so many people show up and
smoke in your living room and your
landlord yells at you?” he said.

Snyder film has comic pop, lacks plotline punch

Randi Alu
Stajfwriter

Ifyouwant to watch impossibly hot girls inlingerie
ﬁght robot samurai, giant dragons and zombie
Nazis, go see director Zack Snyder’s newest ﬁlm

“SuckerPimc ”Ifyou like cerebral commentary '

on the power of the mind, stay home.

“Sucker Punch” premiered on Friday. It is yet
another visually stunning addition to the pop-
comicﬁlm genre and Snyder’s body ofwork. Yet it
is considerably shallow and underdeveloped.

Snyder had a real opportunity to make this _

ﬁlm comment on society — or at least to have
a strong female lead. Generally adaptation is
Snyder’s strong points — he directed remakes
of “Dawn of the Dead,” “Watchmen” and “300,”
whichwereallderivedfrompopularcomics_—but
thistimehehelped co—writetheoriginal screenplay
for“SuckerPunch.” He stepped outofhis comfort
zone, though perhaps notenough.Wasthisawise
career move, considering the popularity of his
adaptation work?

In some ways, yes.

The ﬁlm is the story of a young woman sent
to a mental hospital by her stepfather. Inthe time
period and setting — which is unclear because
of the anachronistic music and some props —

has ﬁve  until hers. Her mental institution
also happens to be a brothel, where she is forced

' to dance for the club owner.

To escape thefrightﬁil reality ofher imprison-.
ment, shefalls into the lantasyworld that shehas
created. In this world her obstacles are the robot
samurai, giant dragons and zombie Nazis,butthe
realvillains oftheﬁ]mareinherreal1ife.Whenshe

And from the start, Snyder misses chances
for commentary. -

. It’s unclear whether he’s trying to highlight
women’s struggles or whether he’s actually de-

gradingthem. While sexis includedinrnanyﬁlms, '

the way inwhich it is depicted in Snyder’s work in
particular can be a cause of discomfort.

“300”isaprime example ofthis. The gratuitous 2

sex scene attheﬁ]m’s startandthe enslavement of

a highly opportune time.

Odd Future is nothing if not a paradox.

Tyler the Creator starts off the song “Yon-
kers” by making this clear: “I’m af"‘cking walk-
ing paradox / No I’m not.” In his Twitter posts,
Tyler references his love of other Internet
sensations like Justin Bieber and Rebecca

Odd Future would predictably hate. In inter-

confused by the mixed messages, you’re on the
right track. In interviews, the kids curse and
sure do talk a lot about “bitches.” In videos,
they spray paint and skate like punks, and
their handful of shows quickly evolve into
mosh pits. But beneath it all, they seem like a
bunch of sweet kids, probably too smart for
their own good. I

The room is long and rectangular. The stage
area is a ‘deep alcove in the center with only
enough room between it and the stairs to allow
for a crowd two or three deep. As a result, the
audience and musicians cluster at the sides of
the stage, sometimes sitting on the amps lining
the stage wall. The locale createsan intimate an
social aunosphere. I

From si'gn—ups on Facebook, Greenwood and
Truckenbrod schedule aboutsix orseven local acts

“justbreathe.” Soon her shaking calmed, and she

In a conversation later, Greenwood said, “Isn’t

Magarity feels that sometimes the intimacy
adds to the pressure of performing. _

“It’s just a room ﬁill of people I don’t know

parties have begunto create acommunityof indi-

“Generally, no, people aren’t nervous,” Green-
wood said. '

In addition to providing space to play, these ‘

parties have also allowed musicians to inﬂuence
one another, as well as provided the opportunity
for the audience to give feedback, 'I‘ruckenbrod
said. He noted that one of the music night acts,
Good/Ease — a combination of spoken word,
moments ofhip-hop and indie—pop choruses —
popped up from someone’s suggestion on the
event’s Facebookwall.

“'I‘hey’re taking active interest in what they

Davis said that for aspiring blues musicians
from across the country, “Chess Records was the

of the North, Chess Records soon began gaining
popularity over traditional “race records,” which
marketed black musicians exclusively to black

the brothers would arrange shows for the artists

of a record industry domineered by ﬂashy,
egotistical rappers. Sure, Tyler the Creator’s
placing a tall order by threatening Kanye, but
there is something a little Captain Hook-ish
about that man. 2 .

I was initially turned off by the content of
Odd Future’s songs. No matter how intricate
the rhyme schemes, the subject matter is inar-
guably deplorable — worse than old Eminem
and probably more disgusting than Marilyn
Manson. But an article by Bethlehem Shoals in
Poetry Magazine, of all places, drew parallels
between the rap group’s poetry and futurism,
an artistic movement that expresses loath-
ing of everything old in admiration of speed,
technology, youth and violence.

Odd Future — I don’t think the placement
of “Future” in the group’s name was an acci-

dent ——- seems to embrace all of those ideals »

in its ‘music videos and performances, and
certainly in its rap lyrics. It’s easy to write off
the conglomerate’s vulgar subject matter as
simply vulgar, but at the same time it holds a
kind of sick appeal. When Tyler eats a cock-

roach in “Yonkers,” I was reminded of a kid
eating a cicada in front of me on a playground
in elementary school. I didn’t realize it at the
time, but he was probably trying to impress‘,
me. And for all their supposed “hatred” of
women, the lyrics sound more like an old-
school “girls-are—gross” approach to sex and
love. If you can stomach it, it’s kind of funny.
There is always the risk of being taken se-

riously —— Charles Manson read too much
into “Helter Skelter,” and it is way easier to
not read enough into Odd Future’s blatant
violence, anarchy and nihilism. And the fact
that they are kids is sensational, but still scares
me — watch their performance on Jimmy
Fallon or the music video “Earl” and you’ll

understand why. f-

But I think the scare is good. Ultimately, I
think Odd‘ Future is trying to draw attention
to how messed-up things are these days — I
would argue that the current world situations
make it easier than ever to be a nihilist, an
anarchist, an atheist. Playing up their desen-
sitization, their “dumb kids” act, taps into a
new social consciousness affected by Gadhaﬁ,
Jared Lee Loughner and those damn violent
video games.

An odd future is happening now, indeed. I

Gibbs has until May 8 to re-
move himself from the draft,
making him eligible to play for
Pitt next season. If he hires an
agent, he will lock himself into
the draft and forfeit his eligibility
to return to Pitt. A

The New Jersey native, who
averaged 16.8 points per game
this season, and other under-
classmen have more reason to
consider the NBA Draft this year,

as teams can now pay for players’ _

- travel expenses.

Gibbs’ projected draft stock
won’t really be known until he
works out with NBA teams, but
N BADraft.net, a major draft web-
site, projects that former Pitt
teammate Brad Wanamaker, a
senior this year, will be the No.
59 player to be taken in the June
23 draft. Sixty-two players get
taken into the draft each year.

Former teammate Gilbert
Brown has also popped up on
some mock draft sites as a po-
tential second-round pick. I

When parents give their children
advice, it often goes unheard or ig-
nored. But when Alyssa O’Connell’s

somebody out there better than

to you,” O’Connell listened.

would describe herself as a player,

guidance. She called herself per-

“That’s what I’m most proud of:
staying positive,” she said. “There

she makes it her goal to stay focused

outing, when the day’s "batters

The difficult times help her learn
how to react in similar situations,
she said.

“The hard times let you become

“If things were always great, you

O’Connell is 8-2 on the season,

G REQORIAN RANTS

VCU proves NCAA Tournament should be expanded

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

 

Remember when VCU shouldn’t have made
the NCAA Tournament?

“These are horrible decisions,” analyst
Jay Bilas said on ESPN’s Selection Sunday
show after the bracket was announced.
“When I look at UAB and VCU at the expense
of some of these other teams  these were
bad decisions. They’re indefensible.”

Less than two weeks later, VCU upset
No. 1 seed Kansas to make it all the way to
the Final Four. The Rams beat ﬁve schools
from ﬁve different conferences in a matter
of 12 days.

But Bilas is still right.

VCU didn’t have a resume worthy of the
tournament. The Rams ﬁnished 12-6 in the
Colonial League and lost to Georgia State and
Northeastern. Noteworthy wins stop after
No. 25 George Mason and UCLA. '

They went into their conference tourna-
ment thinking they had to win it to get to
March Madness. They lost in the ﬁnals. As a
result, the team watched Cartoon Network
and went out for burgers instead of tuning
into Selection Sunday, according to the As-
sociated Press. ‘ .

But this column isn’t about VCU’s lack-
luster resume or Bilas’ hollering. At the end
of the day, the Rams'—-— that podunk team
that needed overtiméto beat Delaware last
month -— knocked off USC, Georgetown,
Purdue, Florida State and Kansas, all in a
row.

And that, unfortunately, means the NCAA

Tournament should expand.

No one likes change. People applauded
the First Four idea because it added three
teams to the tournament without altering
much of anything. The bracket stayed in
its iconic form.

.~ But if a fringe team can make it to the
Final Four, then what does that say about

the other teams left out? As improbable as
it might be, Colorado, Virginia Tech and a
dozen other NIT—bound teams had the ca-
pacity to do what VCU did. It sounds crass,
but there’s nothing special about the Rams.
They just got hot. -.3

That’s not to downplay the run, though.
To put together ﬁve consecutive games like
VCU has is miraculous. But during a sea-
son in which Illinois—Chicago beat Illinois,
Charlotte beat Tennessee. and Drexel beat
Louisville — not to mention the upsets of
No. 1 teams — you can’t tell me 96 teams in
the NCAA Tournament would water down
the competition. .

It actually would improve the early-round
games. With 24 teams to a region, the top
eight seeds receive a bye, and the bottom
16 seeds play each other for a spot in the.»
second round. Voila!

The tournament grows to a full slate of
competitive ﬁrst—round games — no more
First Four round — and top seeds face stron-
ger opponents early. What’s better: Florida
vs. UC—Santa Barbara or Florida vs. Harvard?
With weak teams weeded out, a No. 1 seed
could drop its ﬁrst game.

over Robert Morris’, in which she gave up
three hits and struck out six batters.

Fellow senior and pitcher Cory Berliner
said O’Connell is dedicated in every aspect

‘ of her life, whether on the ﬁeld or in the

classroom.
“Alyssa is a very hard worker and is dedi-

V cated to playing her best and being her best

on and off the ﬁeld,” Berliner said. “She is
focused while playing and has a strong drive
to win and encourages the team to play their
best.” ;

Pitt head coach Holly Aprile also praised
O’Connell’s work ethic, saying that since the

‘ senior arrived on campus her freshman year,

O’Connell has focused on improving all of her
pitches and on “soak[ing] up everything she’s

' been taugh .”.

ball player and playing until she was 5 years
old. When her older sister started playing
softball when O’Connell she was 10, O’Connell
began getting involved as well. She started
pitching around age 9.

“I mostly started playing because of my
sister,” she said. “But my parents were really
involved as well. I really liked doing it, and I
was pretty good at it so I kept playing.”

At Camden Catholic High School in New
Jersey, O’Connell was a four—time ﬁrst team
All—Olympic Colonial Conference selection
and a four—time All—Parochial team selection.
The school retired her jersey number follow-
ing her senior season.

She chose Pitt mainly because of her
chemistry with the team. She said that the
group felt like family.

“Everyone really opened their arms to
you,” she said. “It wasn’t only about softball,
but also about creating friendships.”

spin,” Aprile said. “She’s done a really good
job of doing tons of work on her own through
the summers.”

A second-year team captain, O’Connell
holds the title this year along with Berliner
and senior Reba 'I‘utt.

As both a senior and a pitcher, O’Connell
said she feels a responsibility as a leader.

“I’ve kind of always felt that I could lead
people because of my outgoing personality,”
O’Connell said. “As a pitcher, you have such an
important role on the ﬁeld  you can control

the pace of the game and control a lot about 4

the game.”-

As O’Connell has developed from her
freshman year, she said she has become
more conﬁdent not only as a player, but as
a leader.

“I was timid freshman year, thinking,
‘These girls are so much bigger and older than
me,”’ she said. “You gain a lot of conﬁdence
just by playing in general. My pitching has
gotten better too, but I’ve mentally gotten a
lot more confident.” -

Last season, O’Connell picked up her ﬁrs
career no-hitter in a game against St. Francis.
She ﬁnished the season with 23 starts, 12
wins, 12 complete-games and 165 innings
pitched —— all career highs. A '

The pitcher started playing softball when
she was young, beginning her career as a T-

also fell in love with the city of Pittsburgh
and Pitt’s campus, adding that academics
played an important role in her college selec-
tion process as well. An accounting major,
O’Connell plans to get her master’s degree
in accounting following graduation and then
take her CPA exam.

Aprile said she’s as impressed with
O’Connell’s work in the business school as
she is with the pitcher’s performance on the
ﬁeld. The player earned a 4.0 last semester.
Right now, O’Connell is focused on helping
the Panthers achieve their goals for the sea-
son. Although she said the main goal is to
go to the Big East tournament and win the
championship in May, the team is intent on
taking the season one game at a time.

“We have a saying, ‘Win every game. Win’
every pitch,”’ she said. “We don’t want to get
too ahead of ourselves. We want to have a
really good bat, win the next game we play.
Then we want to win every series, win two
out of three?’ ‘

With her senior season already under-

‘ way and the team off to a strong 22-6 start,

O’Connell said she thinks this year will pro-
vide her with the most memorable moments
of her career as a Panther. '

“This is the best start we’ve ever had,
everybody is super excited about this year.
This will be my greatest moment, I can tell
already,” she said. I
