Housing Problem Grows

these, only about 25 percent have
been ﬁlled ‘because of the acute
housing -shortage in this district.

‘Students who know of houses
that are avail-able to tenants
should inform the Housing bureau
in 801 Cathedral of Learning of
their locati-on so that all housing
in this area is fully utilized.

Director of the Housing bureau,
Charles Ebert, Jr., and his assist-
ant, Miss Caroline Miller, use the

facilities. r

Heinz Chapel Choir

Organizes F or Fall

So the Heinz Chapel choir may
take up its activities without de-
lay next fall, plans have been
made to reorganize the choi.r be-
tween now and the end of this
semester. Of the 45 present mem-
bers of the choir, approximately
one—half of them will not be back
next fall. Any one interested in
trying out for the choi may do so
by seeing Theodore M. Finney,
professor of music appreciation,
any time during the day from
now until the close of this term.

Mr. Finney will arrange a try-
out for any applicant in which
he will determine something of
the range and quality of his voice.
All try—outs will be done indi-
vidually on music or scales se-
lected by him.

The choir sings in the Heinz
chapel every Friday and Sunday
afternoon during the regular
schooltterm. It will be inactive
through the summer until, the
week before registration, when
it will ‘spend a week of practice
and entertainment at Camp Pitt,
near Laural Ridge, Pa.

In addition to its regular per-
formances in Heinz chapel the
choir goes on a concert tour each
year. This year the choir sang
concerts at 15 Pennsylvania
towns.

Mr. Finney stressed the fact
that the choir is a social organi-
ation as well as a musical or-
ganiaztion. In speaking of his
association with the choir one
member, Johnny Pager said, “It
was one of my most pleasant ex-
periences in my years at the Uni-
Versity.”

Dr. Farmer Gives

V Dr. William R. Farmer, Univer-
sity chaplain, will speak at the
last chapel service of the year
this Friday, in Heinz Chapel at

Farmer’s talk will be “Let’s Go
On With the Game.”

Sarah J-ordan will serve as stu-
dent leader, and the Heinz Chapel
choir will sing “Ave Verum,” by
Foerster-Finney.

, This ‘will be the last service till
classes commence again next fall.

The service will conclude at
1:25 o’clock.

All students and faculty mem-
bers are invited to attend.

Sports Editor,
Librarian:

indicate the end of that particular piece of news or story, and A

with ‘.today’s issue of the Pitt. News, we reluctantly sign -30- to
our paper for this year. '

" "It is especially difﬁcult to do because we have had not only
fun_ putting out the paper this“‘year»but we feel that through
ourwork wevhave gained valuable experience towards our gfuture
careers; we ‘feel that our work has been appreciated and that
some people eiijoyed the news, feature articles and editorial
1naterial_ within the eight pages.

 Only o_ur best wish.es,"rernain to be passed on to next year’s
staff-, in the hope that they, too, have a successful year provid-
ing a‘r.studen't publication that will report the activities of our
campus, and further relations of our University with other
schools and_ colleges.

jfI‘hus, wesay farewell to all :the staff members who so will-
ingly gave their.timc, who so enthusiastically cooperated with
us, and to whom the News meant more than just an activity.
And now, .30.’  ‘ J D

_f’Perhap‘s you think a greeting is a strange thing to ﬁnd in

‘the -farewell edition of the Pitt News. But when the old editor
is le-'avi-ng-"to make place..for- the new, it is entirely in order.

vBut.befor.e the ink is long dry on this, Betty 'Wol_fe’s last,
edition as editor of the Pitt News, may I, on behalf of the staff
and_ "i.nyself,, extend best wishes to her for a successful future.
During the past year it has, indeed, been pleasant working with
Betty——-not under, but with her. And that is my wish for next
year staff, working together, always cooperating in an effort.
to give to the studentsand faculty of the University a news-
paper toward which they can point with pride; a staﬁ, which
will enjoy its work and ﬁnd pleasure in doing it. i

As we look around the News ofﬁce and see desks devoid of
the familiar faces, we feel nostalgia creeping over us. Many
qu,e__sti_ons come to mind as we look ahead: Who is going to re-
place Edna in the morgue? Wliere can we ﬁnd a copy boy as
faithful‘.-‘as the last? And .just WHO could possibly take the
place of Jin1'Pettica11, ra_bble—rouser, pro tem? While on the sub-
ject of Monsieur Pettican, a defence should be written in his be-
half. In contrast to his ‘rabble-rousing” fame, (acquired when
on numerous occasions he found it necessary to take a stand
on controversial subjects, which many others put off with a

' mere shrug of the shoulder,) Jim has authored many of the
humorous ditties found in the Pitt News in the past two years,
and "also Pitt Proﬁles. He was “ghost writer” for several Pitt-
pourri «columns and we may now unveil him as the original
Teddy Termite.-» (This may be of interest to his "fans in Johns-
town.) But new people will replace these, our old and dear
friends, beit as rabble-rousers, or copy boys, and we who are
left behind--shall carry on. ' - -- ’

Yes, we-’sl1_al‘l carry on next year as those before us have
done, continuing to give to the Pitt students and faculty an im-
partial account of University life and activity, asking for more
student contributions to the Pitt News and inviting more over-
all student interest in the News. Our offices will always be open.

‘It is my desire, as editor of the 1946-47 Pittt News that dur-
ing the next school year not one person.at the University of
Pittsburgh shall ask, “Where is the Pitt News ofﬁcel”, but that
it will beras familiar" to each as his own home, that it will be the

Well amen, this is it.’ Yep, the

last of the Vet G. I. Zette. If you
think we’ve saved the best for
the last, you're crazy. Not that
we’re glad that it’s over,’ but not
that we’re not. The only thing
that made us happy was being
able to take a few cracks at the
ex—ofﬁcers and, of course, in our
annominity enjoying the safety
thereof. Now our boss‘ has asked
us to apologize and say that we
were wrong about ofﬁcers and
that really they were sweet, kind.
and efficient. "Okay, all you guys
who think otherwise -— oiﬁcers
were sweet, kind, and efficient.

We’re proud of our accomplish-
ments, too. This column likes to
feel that it; is responsible for the
lifting of the pickle limit in the
Tuck Shop. If Men’s Council
hadn’t beat us to it we’d have got-
ten you those hooks in the Men’s
Powder Room, too.

As a ﬁnal service leave us thor-
oughly confuse you about Summer
Sessions. P.L. 16 men had better
go—to school, that is, and no
foolin’! And listen men, carry the
full load of credits. From every-
thing we were able to gather un-
oﬁicially P.L. 16 men may have
their beneﬁts snatched away upon
reexamination by the V.A. if they
interrupt their schooling for more
than a normal period. A complete
summer’s vacation would be more
than a normal interruption. Are
you unhappy, bewildered? If you
are we've succeeded in our pur-
pose. Remember, slaves, to school

Radium Shown

At Alumni Hall

An historical exhibit of radium,

-sponsored «by the department of

-chemistry in connection with the
George Westinghouse Centennial,

was displayed last week.

The exhibit included sam-
ples of fused soil formed in Ala-
mogordo, New Mexico, after the
explosion of the experimental at-
omic bomb and fused glass brought
from Hiroshima, Japan. The ex-
hibit also included ores from which
radium is produced‘; samples of
commercial radium, which was
ﬁrst produced in Pittsburgh; im-
plements for handling radium
safely; measuring equipment; and
replicas of the ten tubes "which
contained the gram -of radium,
presented by the women of Ameri-
ca in 19.21 to Madame Marie Curie,

And now you lucky 346 men,
You. are advised to go to—school,
but at least if you take a vacation
your beneﬁts will still be yours
and no mistake. Your only difficul-
ty might lie in the" fact that it
will be about six’ weeks after, the
fall semester begins before your
subsistence check comes through.
As to registration 346 men will
ﬁll out _a re-registration form
which is promised to be" tres sim-
ple and will entail a minimum of
red tape.  _

So, that’s it. If either 346 or
P.L. 16 students have individual

YM should be--a channel through
which the "college student can work
out maturity in religious life. They
are to be considered as a work-
-shop, a place’ to try out things
learned" in the classroom.”

. What do they do up on the
eighth floor in the YM office, and
on the thirteenth ﬂoor in YW of- ,
,ﬁc-e, to exercise these purposes?
Torn Harrington, a 1945-46 cabinet
member of YM gave a brief sum-
up of Pitt ‘YM in these words. “It’s
-"a home away from home——a place
where the boys can come for rec-
reation, and inspiration.” What

makes up the recreation? Here at .-

the university it’s chess and bridge
on theeighth ﬂoor. “They just
ﬂock‘ up there!” said Tomiwild
jeyed, waving his arms in imita-
tion of a mass ﬂight.‘

YW’ has spent enjoyable week- ' ’
ends camping. The girls swim, __

play ball, and compete in archery.‘

YM and YW" weekended at Camp‘ i

Carondowanna last October. Not
only do students enjoy themselves
camping, but they receive ed-
ucational and religious beneﬁt
from the conferences and‘ lectures.‘
They have had as guest speakers
Dr. T. Z. Koo of the World Student
Christian federation, Huguette,

Balzola of the World Student 1

Service fund, Sidney Lovett, Chap-
-lain of Yale university, and many
others. '

Where does the inspiration come
from? Said Tom, “It’s found in
the friendship which grows among
the fellows, and in the work we:
carry onto try to live better, and;
make better living.” Said Mrs.
Batz, “The girls ﬁnd inspiration

in working with one another, Qne -

girl came to me and said‘ she found
inspiration in being able to wor-
ship in her own faith, and yet
W01‘ShiDS, at the same time, with
her‘ friends of other faiths.” The
girls in YW have worked togeth- 
er
ghans to be sent through the Red
Cross to families in Europe. The
girls gathered clothes, and assist;
ed in the canned food drive for
European war relief. Here is in-
spiration in working for other
people, in service rendered by“
students ‘here and" students 
over the world for people all over
the WOl‘ld. 

Dr. Quick said, “The summer

As Oil Experts

Singular honor was paid Pitt
this semester when the U. S. Army
selected Pittto train twelve‘ of its
officers as oil experts.

This group of ofﬁcers are study-

ing oil under Dr. R. E. Sherrill, .

head of the oil and gas depart-
ment. They have an enviable ser-
vice record. In all they have been

 --decorated with four Silver Stars.

a Legion of Merit Medal four
D.F.C.’s, thirty Aid Medals, two
Purp1e,Hearts, four Bronze Stars,
two Philippine Liberation Medals,
three Croix deg _ Guerres, and
thirty-six Battle Stars.

One served on three beach-
heads in the Paciﬁc plus almost a
year in the European Theater.
Another landed on Omaha Beach
seven, days after “D” day and
fought in Europe until “V E” day.
A Ranging in rank from Lieuten-
ant Colonel to Captain, these of-
ﬁcers are all College graduates,
including nine from West Point.

. _ Ten_ states are represented by

_ . ' ffootball

1

'these men: Massachusetts, New

' Jersey,,New York, Maine, Louisia--,
,_,‘na, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Okla-

,homa, and West Virginia.

2 While in college, they did not’

[spend all their time studying.‘
*-They were all represented on the
and swimming teams.
Some of them also played bar ket-
ball, soccer, or la crosse. But now
they are working for Master of

Science degrees and have little_

time for anything but study.
v When they receive their de-
grees V in February,-~ they may be

. assignedto any part of the world

~where they are needed, to Texas
;or. Oklahoma oil ﬁelds, or even
I-rar,1._-« _. ~ .

According to Dr.  Sherrill,
“The Army is conscious of its de-

 pendence .on oil. It wants :men

 

-trained in _o~il._so that it need no

v;«;-.-_,1onger. rely entirely on civilian

    MEN AND WOMEN.
CAMP COUNSELORS

College students interested in working in a camp this summer,
call Miss Evans, Highland 0657, for an interview. Counselors

should have some knowledge of
swimming, ‘nature study, arts

 tenanee staff. _ .

pottery, dramatics, folk dancing, singing, etc.
‘ Pittsburgh; 10 to 14 week season._ Positions also open for main-

guidance. It wants its own men
to work intelligently with the oil
industry, to know the problems
of production and transportation,
and when prices, quantities and
grades are right.”

The twelve officers’ are: Lieu-
tenant Colonels Leon Stann, Otis
Ulm, ‘M. J. McKeever, C. F.
Matheson, and Merton Singer;
Majors Wm. Latta, C. F. Danforth,
and Jack Sinclair; Captains Rich-
ard Moushiegan, Richard Schles-

Summer Term
Offers Course
In Latin

Dr. Jotham Johnson, associate
professor of classics and acting
head of the department,- has an-
nounced that t-he department will
offer Latin 1, 2 in summer school.
This is in response to requests
from veterans and other students
who wish to take Latin to satisfy
their foreign-language require-
ments.

“The class will meet for an hour
and a half daily all summer,” Dr.
Johnson states, “and will carry
three credits ‘for each session. Stu-
dents who successfully complete
this course will be admitted to
the regular Latin 3, 4 cours-e dur-

ing the 1946-47 session, and j will « I.

thus be ableto. satisfy the two-
year foreign-language requirement
in one calendar’ year.”

« Mark E. Hutchinson, prominent‘
writer on classical subjects and

chairman of the classics depart-‘

ment at Cornell college, Mt. Ver-
non, Iowa, will be visiting profes-
sor of Latin during the first six-
weeks session of summer school.

Mr. Hutchinson will take the.
place -of Dr. Johnson, who will bé_"_.
on vacation. He will give courses j,
' in the history of'Latin literature,

Lucretius, and an advanced course
in the teaching of Latin for teach-
ers in' service. 
“Law schools and m e d i cal
schools throughout the country,”-
Dr. Johnson continued, “are be-
ginning t-0 apply pressure t-o appli-
cants to offer at least two years of
Latin, and similarly the graduate
departments in English and ro-
mance languages in many univer-
sities will not admit a student to
candidacy for an advanced degree

' until he has passed an examina-
tion in Latin. In View of this, it‘

seems only fair to provide an op-
portunity for fulﬁlling this re-
quirement to Pitt students, who
through misguided advice, skip-
ped Latin in high school.”

Radium ,
(Continued from page two)

The original tubes were prepar-
ed by Glenn D. Kammer and
Henry T. Loenig, graduating
chemists from Pitt in the class of
1912, along with Charles H. Voil;
of the University of Chicago.
These three men were the pio-
neers of the radium industry.
They helped produce the first
commercial radium in the world.

Curator Assists
With Hall of Fame

On behalf of Stephen C-ollins
Foster, Fletcher Hodges Jr., cur-
ator of the Foster Hall Collection
at the University, has been chosen
to place a wreath on the bust of
Booker T. Washington, Negro ed-
ucator, who will be admitted to
the Hall of Fame, New York uni-
versity on May 23.

Mr. Hodges was chosen because
he represents a composer who,
through his music, has advanced
nation-al understanding of the Ne-
gro from slavery to his present
position as exempliﬁed by Booker
Washington. I

Stephen Fo.ster, the last great
American to be admitted to the
Hall «of Fame, was the ﬁrst com-
poser to portray the Negro as a
human, being with human long-
ings.

Life is full of many surprises,

But, in Betty’s case, we knew all
the time

And so we weren’t surprised to
ﬁnd ‘

That good things come in smaller
sizes. .

, . .
Petite dimnutive Betty Wolfe
-has done not only a big job but
also a good job in guiding the des-
tinies of the Pitt News during the
year which is now-coming to an
end. Betty, or rather “the Chief”
as News staffers like to refer to
her, will be remembered here for
her saucy smile and her way of
getting things d-one, tactfully but
thoroughly. Betty came to us, com-
plete with brow-n curly hair and
grayish green eyes from Verona
High school where she was editor
of the yearbook, and a member of

7 the band, -orchestra, and leaders

club. Her Pitt activities center
around the News to which she has
contributed many hours. Starting
as a reporter, Betty moved up to
feature editor, then to" campus ed-
itor, and ﬁnally to editor. Her
other campus activities include

-Mortar Board, Xylon,‘ Phi Mu fra-

ternity, and she is also included

in this year’s Hall of Fame.

Summer News

Seven issues of the Pitt Sum-

“mer News will be published dur-

inng the summer sessions.
According to Robert X. Graham

assistant professor of English, the

first of these will be issued on
registration day, Thursday, June
13. '

In order to make it easier for
Mr. Graham and the staff, it is
being asked that all copy be sub-
mitted by Monday or Tuesday of
the week before the paper comes
out. '

It’s Jack who keeps our ﬁgures
straight,

And sells our ads and pays our
bills;

So, in his job, he really rates,

For it’s one bill, he ably ﬁlls.

Stepping into John Whitman’s
shoes last fall was no easy assign-
ment for anyone, but Jack Bloom
did it -and found them a satisfac-
tory ﬁt into the bargain. Jack
spent his high school days at Tay-
lor Allderdice High where he be-
longed to the Allderdice Adjust-
ment association——-an organization
similar to our Student Congress-
in a-ddition to singing in the school
choir and participating in various
other activities. After high school,
he ‘went to the University of Mich-
igan where he worked on the
Michigan Daily. He arrived at Pitt
in June -of 1944 where he changed
his course from pre-law to busi-
ness administration. Here at Pitt,
in addition to being a campus
swoon boy (as coed sighs in his
proximity will indicat-e), ‘genial
good-looki-ng Jack has found time
for a wide range of activities
which include O-micron Delta Kap-
pa, Phi Epsilon Pi social frater-
nity, Phi Eta Sigma, Order of the
Artu.s, and his recent nomination
to the Hall of Fame.

Jack tells us his chief hobbies
are poker, taking his car apart and
putting it together again, and re-
pairing watches. He is quite la-
conic about his love-life, but he
did mention that he likes to “tease
women.” As to his post-college
plans, he -says, “I’m going out to
California for a vacation before I
think about a vocation. I may
stick around out there awhile, but
I expect to eventually‘ drift back
to Pittsburgh and go into the auto
accessories .1 business.” Personally,
we think that Jack will be a com-
petent accessory to any bussiness.

Male nurse? Whoever heard of
a male nurse! Well hear about one
now. Hear about a young man
who turned _ down an athletic
scholarship to take up nursing.
Paul Snyder,‘ who works as a
nurse at the Veteran’s hospital in
Aspinwall, has an interesting story
of experiences working in what
everyone has mistakenly believed
a woman’s World.

“I suppose you wonder what
made me decide to take up nurs-,
ing, instead of accepting the schol-
arship,” said Paul. While Paul was
in high school he made the all
Northwestern basketball team in
1935. -At ﬁrst he accepted the
scholarship, but after thinking for
awhile, he decided that he wanted
to get into a ﬁeld that wasn’t
overcrowded. So he followed up
the suggestion of a friend of his,
D.r. McKay, superintendent of
Mercer sanitarium. Knowing that

ed St. Joseph’s hospital school of
nurslng and graduated in 1943.
“You may think that the step
from athletics to nursing is a dras-
ticone,” said Paul, “but actually
there is a valuable connection be-

Following his graduation, Paul
entered the Navy as the ﬁfteenth
registered male nurse. Because
there were no commissions given
to male nurses, he went in as a
pharmacist’s mate; He worked as
a medic and was put in charge of
inoculations, or “shot detail” as it
is more popularly known._ Inci-
dentally, while in the navy, Paul

Paul plans to continue in post-
graduate work in nursing. “You
have no idea how badly more
male nurses are needed,” said
Paul. ‘In heavy industry with its
irregular night shifts, locations,
and working conditions, a male
nurse is much more suited to the
jom.. Big airlines employ male
nurses. In the oil ﬁelds in South
America only mal-e nurses are
used. “A friend of mine,” said
Paul, “is a nurse in one of those
oil ﬁelds. He operates a small hos-
pital with eight beds. He works
with the natives, laborers, and
missionaries in taking care of in-
juries or illnesses that might arise
in that region.”

Contrary to popular belief there
is chance for advancement for
male nurses in supervising and in
tea-ching. Paul, who is interested
in psychiatric work, believes that
there is a -big n-eed for more state
institutions.

Snorts Editor

This is the time of year when students do 'their’recollectlng be-
fore graduation and many high school athletes wonder where they

will continue’ their athletic careers.

This might be the time to try and persuade your hometown athlete to look
into Pitt, before someone else turns him southward. Some of the small southern
schools who seem to have some staunch boosters up this way are Richmond. VMI,
and Auburn. Possibly they have some boosters with more inﬂuence than you or
I; that is your high school coach.

Look into the matter and maybe you’ll be proud to say some
day, “I got this boy to come to Pitt and boy what a ballplayer he is.”
Looking Back .

Not only have we reached the last edition of the Pitt News for
this year but I have reached the end of the trail as sports editor.

The position was sure a swell one to hold. I met all types of
people from here, there, and everywhere. Many of these people sup-

plied me with the information that ﬁlled this spot in the past issues.

I would like to use this opportunity to thank Dr. H. C. Carlson, Jimmy Hagan,
Wes Fesler, Doc Hartwig. Mike Milligan, Lyal Clark, Dick Fisher, Carl Olson, Ralph
Mitterling, George Weekes, Frank Carver, Miss Low, and Miss Ehrenfeld for the
excellent cooperation they gave me and my sports staff.

A few others who aren't connected with the University but helped along with
bits of information and a picture or two are Harry Keck, sports editor of the Sun-
Telegraph and Jack Henry of the same paper; Bob Drum and Fred Landucci of
the Press and Jack Sell of the Post-Gazette. Others who helpedbut are no longer
connected with Pitt are Clark D. Shaughnessy. who supplied me with material for
many a column and Bob Hoel and Stan Olenn.

Now let's take a look at Pitt 011 the athletic field these past four
years: ~

Pitt has been at its lowest. Clark Shaughnessy took over the
grid job here when I was just a freshman. A

Everyone thought a new era had arrived at the Skyscraper uni-
versity. A pep rally was held in Stephen Foster memorial welcom-
ing the T master to Pitt. Banners and placards decorated the audi-
torium with astronimical scores painted on them with the'Panthers
walloping Notre Dame, Army, and most any other leading university
one could think of. When that season rolled around the scores were

just in reverse and has remained such. -

Glancing over the other sports. We find Dr. Carlson still at the head basketball
coaching job. The doctor will be in his 25th year of coaching next season. These
war years Pitt basketball kept going. Carlson kept it at its merry pace with his
joking and clowning and even got himself and team written up in Look magazine.

Besides football and basketball Pitt ﬁelded a baseball team. The
teams were nothing to brag about, failing to win a game in .two years.
Last year the Panthers broke the ice with a victory and now Coach
Ralph Mitterling has his boys back on top.

Now with the war over things look brighter.

Carl Olson, since his discharge from the Navy, has his tracksters
out there ﬁghting and Dr. Dave O’Lough1in’s tennis team is once more
pounding the ball over the nets.

Looking Ahead
Looking ahead I see winning football at Pitt. Not this year, nor

the following; but watch them in Fesler’s third year as head coach.
In looking ahead I can see one thing that will send Pitt to the top. The Big
Ten. Talk has it that Pitt has already been accepted. That is just bunk. We
never applied. Watch m---t year, Pitt will apply to the Big Ten and they will be
accepted shortly afterwards. . ’ I ;
Space is short and oi.ce again I would like to thank everyone who has aided
me, especially my sports staff. I think they did an excellent job in covering Pitt
athletics. And to the next sports editor I wish all the luck in the world.

Pitt In IC4A ‘Meet Saturday

A

By Al Roth

Although track has already made its formal adieu at Pittfor
the 1946 outdoor campaign, activity on the stadium cinderpath will
not cease. “ . __ -.

Despite the fact"th'at the regular season schedule has been folded,
the Panther thinclads will con-9

tinue daily workouts in prepara-
tion for the _vario_us AAU meets
which are forthcoming over the
summer season.

A speedy trio will participate
in the IC4A championships this
Saturday afternoon at Annapolis. .

Herb Douglas, Clarence Doak, and .
Tommy Carr have all ﬁled en-
tries in the annual intercollegiate
championships, blue ribbon af-
fair of the track season.

Douglas, who at present holds
the ’46 indoor IC4A title in the
"broad jump will attempt a re-
peat at the Navy home. Douglas
tapestretcher of 24 ft., 6 in., at-
tained in the aforementioned
meet, is the University record for
that event. Douglas will also bid
in the 100 yd. and 220 yd. dashes.

ing sprinters, produced in the
state, will compete In the 100

Mlwllublication Heads For 1946-47

= Appointed new business manag-
er of the Pitt News is that happy
looking creature, Jerry Josephs.
Jerry doesn’t come to this posi-
tion empty handed.

‘Last year he ‘worked as assist-
ant business manager with Jack
Bloom and the year before he
worked under John Whiteman.
Besides that he has been on the
b_,.u.siness staff of the Owl for two
years.

Jerry, who will be a junior in
the fall is a pre-law student in
the School of Business Adminis-

. tration. As a member of Druids
i_ he managed a smoker for the

Druids have had. He is treasurer
of his social fraternity, Phi Epsi-
lon Pi.

.- .At T a y l o r Allderdice High
school Jerry worked on the school

 paper and played trumpet in the

W ‘ks-chool orchestra. Most of his free

-/,«..“,m1 <, .,

time he said he spends playing
golf. '

About n-ext year’s Pitt News he
said, “My aim is to produce a pa-
per which ‘will be a ‘credit to the
staff and to the University.”

An engaging p.ersonality topped
by over-all executive ability has
mad-e Tillie Sanker an outstand-
ing campus leader well qualiﬁed
to assume the editorship of the
Pitt News for the 1946-47 term.
Tillie came to Pitt via Verona
High school where she was year-
book editor, cheer leader, and a
member of just about every club
in the school. Here at Pitt, she is a
member of Mortar Board, presi-
dent of Xyl-on, publicity director
of the Inter-collegiate Conference
On Government, a Junior Worthy,
and a member of Theta P-hi Alpha
fraternity, in addition to numer-
ous other activities. , '

Her journalistic e x p eri en c e
dates from her high school days
when she served as the Verona
High correspondent for the Alle-
gheny Advance-Leader.

‘Her two favorite hobbies are
tennis and canoeing. Raw carrots
are her special delicacy and a sup-
ply of them can always be found
in her desk or pocketbook.

In addition to waiting to take
over the -‘editorship next fall. she
is also waiting these days for the
“boat to come in” and bring her
Bob back from the Philippines.
Brown-eyed Tillie is one coed
who is truly everywhere, doing

The high ﬁnance in the Owl
ofﬁce is going to be handled by a
very capable man next year.
Grover McCann, appointed busi-
ness -manager of the Owl in Feb-
ruary, ﬁnishing Jim Johns’ term,
has been appointed as manager of
the ’47 Owl.

Mac ﬁnish-ed his ﬁrst year at
the University of Tennessee where
he received a fraternity freshman
award. After his discharge from
the Air corps, in February 1946,
he cam-e to Pitt. Here he has done
much work in publications; he is
the author of that now famous
column “Vet GI Zette”; he worked
on the Panther committee, and
was publicity director for the Vet-
erans association. ,

On Tap Day, Mac was honored

by ODK when he was tapped to
that organization. He was also
named a Junior Worthy. '

“What about next year’s‘ Owl?”
we asked him.

“Next year is going to be the
big year for the Owl,” he answer-
ed with his quiet, subtle smile.
“A lot‘ of good people on our staff
will be back next semester,” he
added. ’

Green-eyed and c 0 In p e t e n t
Jeanne Mostoller brings with her
to the Owl editorship a long and

conspicuous activities rec ord.
Jeanne’s pre-college days were
spent at Somerset High school in
Somerset, Pa., where she was ac-
tive on the yearbook, in class
plays, various clubs, and a mem-

ber of the National Honor Society.
Here on campus, her time is spent
in a long list of activities which
includes guild advisor, housing

board, president of Panhellenic

council, president of Chi Omega
fraternity, Xylon, Mortar Board,
Junior Wor-thy, and of course, the
Owl.

Jeanne, a statuesque brownette,
says her favorite hobbies are
swimming and tennis and is strict-

ly non-committal about her love-‘

life. Jeanne has a vital active in-
terest in journalism, and after ob-
taining her baohelor’s degree here,
she plans to enter the Columbia
University’s School of Journalism
and work for a MA degree.

Having served as assistant Owl

TNT

By Teddy Termite

Having reached that point in
our school career where the pow-
ers-that-be are bribing us with a
scrap of sheepskin to leave the
place, this column must constitute
a sort of combined swan song and
last will and testament. (Ed. Note:
The complete memoirs of one T.
Termite may be found in the Dar-
lington Library archives ﬁled un-
der T for trivial.) Being altruistic,
we are consilgning our su1‘D111S9S
to the neediest places. Thus, we
have a few slightly mauled jokes
-on hand which we are giving to

two fairly rusty car checks which
we are passing on to Bloom to
help pay expense accounts. Sank-
er and Wolfe can have all the car-
rots from last year’s victory gar-
den, and we’re auctioning off a
few left-over comments on Reis-
berg’s neckties. So thanks for
lbearing (or boring)’ with us, and
we hereby declare the termite ter-
minated.
