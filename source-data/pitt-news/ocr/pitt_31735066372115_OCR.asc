Ready For Union Battle?

By MARY KANE

E<iIlOl

In a political campaign. the
candidates involved oppose each
other on just about every issue.
The campaign for faculty unioni-
zation at Pitt takes this to an
extreme; the two sides don‘t even
agree on when an election will be
held.

Philip Wion. president of Pitt
Professional Union, said an elec— _
tion to determine whether or not
Pitt faculty want a collective bar-
.gaining agent could be held this
March.

But John Quatroche, secretary
of the university, is “keeping
abreast" of the unionization
developments, predicted that the
fall of I982 as a more likely date.

Actually, there are a number
of variables. factors and unfore-
seen twists that could cause the
date of a collective bargaining
agent election to fall somewhere
in between.

The first step to forming a
faculty union begins with the
verification that enough faculty
are interested in holding an
election——— either to choose a col-
lective bargaining agent, or to
vote against any representation.

Wion said the PPI,‘
enough faculty support to peti-
tion the Pennsylvania Labor

L,
Hut:

-

Relations Board at the end of
this term for an election. The
PPU is required by the PLRB to
have at least 30 percent of the
faculty in the provost’s areas sign
cards stating they want an elec-
tion to be held.

At this point, 36 percent ofthe
faculty have signed the cards,
and the PPU is pushing for more.

 

Logically, the next step would
be for the PPU to petition the
PLRB to hold hearings, gather
testimony from all parties
involved” in the unionization,
verify the authenticity of the
faculty interest, and then
approve or reject the petition.

lfthePl.RBwere petitioned at
the end ofthis term, and the peti-

 

tion were approved, it would be
election time this. April, Wion
said.

But, according to Quatroche.
if the PLRB sanctions an elec—
ton, the university administra-
tion will kick off its campaign’
against any faculty collective
bargaining agent. 1

New Group To Fight Abortion. Bill

In
§:~:
02%

By MARGARET ATTWOOD

Area physicians and clinics are
joining forces to fight the proposed

state abortion bill that they believe .

will se\>erel_v restrict a woman’s
access to a safe and legal abortion.
The_ Pennsylvania Area Abortion
Providers believe that abortion costs
will increase substantially ifthe Pen-
nsylvania Abortion Control Act is
passed. As a result; they project that
poor and marginal income families
will suffer the most.

The group also believes the pro-
posed bill would destroy privacy and
create delays that might hamper a
woman’s ability to get a “safer" first
trimester abortion. It would also
raise costs to prohibitive levels and
intimidate and confuse women seek-
ing abortions, according to the
group.

Claire Keyes. administrative
superintendent of the Allegheny
Reproductive Health Center,
claimed that the bill is an invasion of

privacy and is designed to put psy-
chological pressure on women seek-
ing abortions.

“Women will be forced to sign a
fetal death certificate and possibly
arrange for a funeral (regardless of
how early the abortion takes place),

"and they will be urged» toloo-k at

photographs of aborted fetuses
before their surgery," Keyes said.

She added that the father will be
required to accompany the client to
the doctors office and prove to the
doctor that he is the father.

“The photographs are simply
designed as torture for a woman
who needs an abortion," said Keyes.
“Most women having abortions

be destructive psychologically and
emotionally."

Other elements of the proposed

bill include:

0 No insurance coverage of abor-
tions for state employees, even in
life-threatening situations;

0 No coverage of abortions for
anyone without payment ofan addi-
tional premium;

0 Counseling by doctors instead
of a trained lay staff;

0 Excessive burden of paper work
for physicians and clinics to
complete.

All these things the Pittsburgh‘

Area Abortion Providers claimed,

lfgift—giving is an indication of
the level of concern former stu-
dents have for their alma mata,
then medical school graduates
are Pitt‘s most loyal allumni.
' l.ast year, former medical stu-
dents contributed about l0 per-
cent. or $255,853 to the
university‘s l980—8l annual giv-
ing fund campaign. Accordingto
Bernard Kopereck. director of
development and alumni affairs.
the entire campaign brought in
over $2 million, $200,000 beyond
the initial target goal.

‘In a rush for second place, the
College of Arts and Sciences, the
Business School, and the School
of Engineering, each came up

with $172,000 from their alumni.
Kopereck said that when an
alumnus donates money, he has
a choice of where he wants to
send it. ln addition to the various
schools, a person can send his
money to the regional campuses,
the library ‘system, or athletic
programs. While medical alumni
furnished the largest amount of
new capital. the largest recipient
of the funds according to Koper-
eck. will probably be athletics.

Alumni. an obvious target for
campaign planners. came up
with a total of$l.446,982 for the
80-81 fiscal year, but non-alumni
totals reached a respectable
$403,074 during the same period.

Keyes said, “Before abortions
were legal, 50 percent of gynecology
wards were filled with women who
had bungled abortions. Are .we
going back to that‘? l'/2 million
women had abortions last year. Are
I.‘/2 million women going to choose
not to have abortions next year?
Women have always had abortions,
and they always will."

On Friday, Sept. l8, the People
Concerned for Maternal Health are
sponsoring a rally in front of the
Allegheny County Courthouse. The
demonstration will be held during a
public hearing before the Health and
Welfare Committee of the State
Legislature, which will be discussing
the Abortion Control Act.

porate matching grants. Ac'cord-
ing to Kopereck, there are about
1000 corporations that offer
matching monies for employee
donations to qualified institu-
tions. Pitt received $l79,084
from 309 businesses across the
country.

Pitt‘s I980-8i campaign
brought in 23.7 percent more
money than it had in I979-80.
marking the l4th year in a row
that Kopereck’s office has man-
aged to top the previous year’s
total. According to Kopereck,
this program has managed to
increase its take by 459 percent
over the last tenyears, “Even
when you take out for inflation,”
Kopereck said. “this has been a
very profitable venture for the
University."

Pitt Studies “on Work Hazards-

Trouble ForBudget Slashers

By FREDERICK BEERS.

Pitt News Stcifl Writer

The Reagan administrations’s \

fight to reduce government regula-
tion may prove to be an uphill battle.

Gary Marsh and Philip Enterline
of the Graduate School of Public
Health’s biostatistics department
have introduced a method to verify
the completeness of data used in
occupational mortality studies. This
technique could have “important
implications" for the successful reg-
ulation of conditions inthe work-
place and, according to a member of
Pitt‘s political science faculty, could
provide “strong evidence"that occu-
pational and safety groups. such as
the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. should not

curtailed.

March and »Enterline employ a
method by which they use Internal
Revenue Service quarterly earnings
reports (Form 94]) which are com-
pletely independent of company-
held records.

Form 94l is used toverify records .
abstracted from company files.

Because ‘studies of this kind are

‘subject to many sources of error,

including clerical oversight or poor
recordkeeping practices, the two
biostatisticsfaculty members stress
that “no eligible persons are over-
looked“ with their method. They
claim the technique is “accurate and
complete.” which eliminates the pos-
sibility of significant error.

“The sensitivity and effectiveness
of the method are demonstrated

Unionization

“Collective bargaining, by it’s
definition and nature. results in
an adversary relationship
between management and‘
labor." Quatroche said.

Keep in mind the university‘
has been through all this before.
and the administration won.

In 1975, the procedure for
establishing a faculty collective
bargaining agent made it
through lengthy hearings with
the PLRB, to a run-off election,
to a final decision of no.

Quatroche was appointed by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar at the
time to establish an office to
research and disseminate infor-
mation on collective bargaining.
This time around, Quatroche is
informally keeping_abreast ofthe
unionization drive.

And this time around. many
things are different. .

ln l975, during the PLRB
hearings, the board ruled that
Pitt could be divided into areas
for collective bargaining; these
included the medical. law and
health-related professions
schools. lt also decided that an
appropriate bargaining unit was
the prov0st‘s area, which covers
the faculty of arts and sciences,
the college of arts and sciences,
the engineering school, the col-
lege of general studies, and other
areas.

Because the appropriate bar-
gaining unit has been defined,
Wion thinks the length of the
hearings this time could be shor-
tened. But Quatroche said the
administration still isn’t
satisfied.

“Our posture is that the elec-
tion should be held among all the
eligible faculty at Pitt.” Qua-
troche said “The decision is for
all the faculty to decide."

if Pitt argues against the 1975
PLRB decision on the approp-
riate bargaining unit the time of
an election would again be
delayed.

The second circumstance that
differs from the first election is a

COUNTER HELP:

recent Supreme Court ruling on
a faculty union at Yeshiva Uni-
versity. The court ruled that the
Yeshiva administration did not
have to recognize the faculty
union voted in by Yeshiva
faculty. The court agreed with
the administrations argument
that Yeshiva faculty were consi-
dered management and not
“labor, since they performed
managerial tasks. such as curric-
ulum decision.

Yeshiva is a private institu-
tion. But Pitt is a strange hybrid
of private and state.-related. Qau-
troche said the university has no
idea what the impact of the
Yeshiva ruling will be, but the
university's lawyers are studying
it.

A third difference in the union
drives is that in I976, four fac-
tions were competing for the title
of faculty collectiveibargaining
agent. No one won. Besides the
PPU, the American Association
of University Professors, the
National Education Association,
and no representation were on
the ballot.

-nmi'nuea'_/rom page one
‘C

Now, however. the PPU is
attempting to form a coalition
with the AAUP to be called the
"United Faculty.“ The National
Education Association hasn’t
been mentioned. And the possi-
bility of no representation is still
there.

Wion is optimistic about the
PPU's chances. He believes col-

lective bargaining is the only way

to forcethe university to sitdown
and listen to faculty request for
increased pay. input, etc. Qua-
troche said the past five years
haven't changed however; the
University is still maintainingiits
position of i976.

“it is the conviction ofthe Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh administra-
tion that the usual case for
unionizationinindustrydoes not
apply to university faculty.
Further, at major high quality
institutions throughout the
country like ours, the veiwpoint
prevails that unionization of
faculty would not be in the inter-
est of the university and its
members, and could be harmful
to academic excellence.

Pitt And The
King’s English

It was said that the Eskimos have a dozen different
words for‘ “snow”—defining types and conditions
and depth in one word’. We of the American culture

‘fail to have this benefit; instead, we increase the

number of words to make up for ‘our inability to
communicate succinctly.

We are fast becoming illiterate. We can read and
write and speak, often a criticism of so-called Black
English, but the main culprit now seems to be the
so-called educated. Black English is rather easy to
discern compared to IRS tax forms and insurance
files. .

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences recently submit-
ted their report on proposed admission and gradua-
tion requiremlents. What is most startling about the
report is its readability. Clear and concise prose
somehow slipped by the usual administrative hacks

- who take special pride in eonfusion.

It is, in fact, the highe: -trtministrative levels that
produce the most illitera-is apeech. It is the govern-
ment, after all, that coin;  ;,.uch memorably useless
phrases like “inoperative s;t%A*'t;ement” and “this point

in time.” Thanks to legai:  you are unable to read
your lease. One often w.’::nders .if that is the sole
purpose.

It is rare that _we are .j . ‘:1 the chance to read an

, important document from the university that seems

accessible in its style. Memos from administrators
are often replete with technical terms and unintelligi-
ble phrases—which seem\s ironic, considering their
position and education. '

The report did not ‘lose any of its impact by ayoid-
ing technical jargon. What was lost for the sake of
style_was more than gained by reducing the chance of
misinterpretation. Hemingway was never particu-
larly verbose, yet now he is particularly famous.

We congratulate Dean Schulman and the Com-
mittee on Curriculum Reform for their concise and
accessible report. It is not the purpose of this editor-
ial to. measure the merits of their recommenda-
tions——'debate and discussion on their findings is no
doubt forthcoming.‘ But the committee’s obvious
concern for clarity will make debate on their report

much more pointedrand rational.

Some Laws of theiUnivers(ity)

‘ By JAMES GILKEYI ,~

Powers Chemco in New York is a
wonderful place as long as you don’t
have to work there. I ought to know.
I have worked for three consecutive
summers. It's not that it lacks
class—the mice that live in the gar-
bage truck will testify to the
contrary—it’s simply a predictable
place.

When the Foreman told the mason
to build a wall, everyone on the first
shift of the maintenance crew
reached for their money. We all
wanted to place a bet on when the
wall would come down.

It is also safe to ‘count on the in-
eptitude of the engineers. They
obviously never graduated from
anything more sophisticated than
Mail Order U, and their remarkable
ability to break slide rules made
them the only group of office
workers who were required to wear
protective hard hats.

Something similar can be said for

this university. It’s a wonderful place
as long as you don’t have to attend
classes. I was remindedof this twice
last week. ’

The first phase came when I
stumbled into my American History
class only to find that it was crowded
with a herd of hostile looking people
and an old professor asking whether
I was scheduled for some strange
economics class. When I mumbled
no, he said that I had been “mis-
placed.” The class burst out in
laughter. Lesson one: economics
professors can be mean and their
students are sadists. After ﬁnding
out who my history professor was, I
was reminded of the corollary to the
first law: when it comes to room
selection, strange pseudo-Marxist
history professors with facial ties are
always displaced by mean econom-
ics professors.

But that was not nearly as crucial
as the second lesson. I learned it__
years ago; it is as unchanging as the

Cathedral. I had a simple reminder
last week—nothing devastating,
nothing stunning, nothing written
on the blackboard. But it was clear
when I looked at the graduate stu-
'dent, with her long flowing dress and
purple dot upon her forehead and
marbles in her mouth, that the rule

had not changed: ifit ispossiblefor a

someone to be unable to speak Eng-
lish correctly, they will be unable to
speak English correctly. It does not
matter what job they have or which

' class they teach. If you wish to be a

neurosurgeon, chances are the guest
lecturer will give a dramatic speech
on clinical therapy that will be

totally incomprehensible to any

native American. It is this universi-

ty’s contribution to Murphy's Law: _

those who can be misunderstood
will be. .

The French say the more things
change the more they stay the same.
Here, and at Powers Chemco, things
fail to even change.

The Real Labor Day Story

Dear Editor:

I was impressed by much of your
thoughtful editorial on the contem-
porary significance of Labor Day
('l‘i:e Pitt News, Sept.9). especially
wl-en you made the point that “the
roots of labor solidarity” can be
found in the working class past(and.
in many cases, the present situation)
of our own families. As you noted,
the long hours and unsafe working
conditions against which our grand-

parents and parents—and even‘

some of usl—have experienced. You
also made an_excellent point when
you noted that “the spirit of solidar-
ity fostered by early, labor leaders
lives today in those who fought .I.P.
Stevens and brown lung, or the
Karen Silkwoods who fight the new
and ever-present dangers of the
nuclear energy business.”

Unfortunately, this was undercut
by your questioning of whether “the
air traffic controllers, the Philadel-
phia teachers and the thousands of
labor strikers that picket this coun-
try every year are true_ to the spirit of
the early unionizers.”

The key issues in the air traffic
controllers’ strike are:

0 The quality of working condi-
tions faced by the controllers (long
hours of stressful work, undermin-
ing their health and creating greater
risks of airplane accidents); ‘

O The right of the government to
compel these workers to sign “yel-

 -low dog” contracts, taking away the. g

 

junta

 

right to strike;

0 The apparent decision of the
Reagan administration to teach the
labor movement a lesson by busting
a recalcitrant union. When Polish
workers defy their own government
bureaucrats on such issues, we
applaud them. And were right to do
so.

You also seemed to accept the
argument that a “fiscal crisis” has
made teacher layoffs “necessary.” In
fact, we need more teachers, better-
trained and better-paid teachers to
help reverse the educational crisis
which has been blighting our
schools.

I agree, there certainly is a fiscal
crisis-—thanks to the fact that the
growing tax burden falls hardest on
the middle—income working people,
who are also hard-hit by inﬂation
and by the increasing number ofjob
layoffs. On the other hand, those
best able to pay taxes(the banks, the
corporations, the wealthy) use their
considerable influence to get tax
breaks. And on top ofthis, the poli-
ticians ruthlessly cut back federal
aid to education and social
programs——while beefing up expen-
ditures on military hardware and for
aid to foreign dictatorships like the
in El Salvador. In short,
teacher layoffs are necessary only
within the framework of the status
quo. . -

If present-day unions are to 

  

criticized, it jshouldézot -be because

 

they continue to fight for their own
members. They should be criticized
because they haven’t been fighting
hard enough to change the status
quo, to establish a more just and
democratic society for all workers.
That’s why we’re in the fix that we're
in today.

You spoke highly of“the spirit of
the early unionizers." But such
people—Albert and Lucy Parsons,
the young Sam Gompers, Eugene V.
Debs. “Mother” Mary Jones and
“Big‘Bill” Haywood—were notjust
seeking “to enjoy the benefits of
their contribution to the company,"
as you put it. They wanted more. lfa
person has to sell his or her mental
and physical labor power to make a
living, then that person is a worker.
Such people—the majority of our
country—keep this country run-
ning. They, and not a minority oftihe
corporate‘ rich or government
bureaucrats, should run the country.

Until the economy and the-politi-
cal process is under the working peo-
ples control, they'll have to keep
fighting—with picket- signs and
strikes and whatever means are at
their disposal—to keep fromggetting
pushed around by those at the top.
That’s as true today as it wasjn the
era of the early labor militants.

The NCAA Council voted Tues-
day to call a special convention the
week of Dec. 6 to consider reorgan-
izing its topldivision in an effort to
head off a battle over television
rights with the Collegiate Football
Association.

The CFA, a splinter group of the
NCAA comprised of 61 major foot-
ball schools, including Pitt, Penn
State, Notre Dame and Nebraska,
has negotiated its own four-year,
$l80-million television contract
with NBC. The CFA pact, in direct
conflict with the NCAA‘s recently
negotiated $263.5-million deal with
ABC and CBS, has touched off a
power struggle to determine who has
the right to award television
contracts—-the NCAA or the
schools themselves.

The NCAA had threatened possi-
ble suspension of members who
adopt the CFA plan, but in related
developments Tuesday, a Texas
state court decision may render that
threat powerless.

A Texas state district judge in
Austin issued ’a temporary restrain-
ing order that prohibits‘ the NCAA
from taking or threatening discipli-
nary action against its schools that

to a class action suit filed earlier
Tuesday in state court by the Uni-

ilar action Tuesday in an Oklahoma

Considers Demands To Restructure

special convention was seen by
many schools as an attempt to com-
promise with the CFA. The CFA
has long called for a restructuring of
Division l-A, collegiate football's
top division, in order to gain greater
self-control over decisions concern-
ing televison rights and football leg-
islation.

“The major problem all along has
been the voting structure. The major
schools feel they should be the ones
to vote on football packages, not
someone like the University of Chi-
cago, who may not even have a foot-
ball program, but still votes on the
TV package," said Dean Billick,

Pitt's associate director of athletics "

for public affairs. “If some CFA
objections tofthe NCAA can be
overcome, it would seem there’s a
good chance both sides could work
things out.”

The attempt to reorganize Div-
ision l-A has met stiff opposition in
the past, mainly from the schools
that could be left out after the
changes Currently, Division I-A
has about l37 members, but the
CFA would prefer to see the mem-
bership trimmed down to a maxi-
mum of 80 or 90 members. i

The CFA would also like to
change the current one-school, one-

vote system, which

employs to ratify football legisla-

tion, including its football television
contracts. The CFA has said elimi-
nating such a vote by the entire
membership would give its schools
greater self-control in determining
their own destiny.

According to Pitt Athletic Direc-
tor Cas Myslinski, the repeated fail-
ures of past attempts to reorganize
led the CFA to negotiate its own
television contract without waiting
for the NCAA to restructure.

“We have tried for the elimination
of the vote before, but we‘ve had a
hard time doing it.” Myslinski said.
“We (the CFA) had to move now
becuase the television contract was
up for renegotiation. We didn’t
know if we could wait another four

a

years.’ -

-There is considerable speculation
whether the CFA can wait until
December and the NCAA meeting.
The CFA decided to push back its
Sept. l0 deadline for schools to vote
on ratification of the NBC contract.
The new deadline is Sept. I8.

Both Billick and Myslinski agree
that the December meeting may be
cutting it close for the network or
networks that eventually receive the
TV rights, since networks require
lead time to line up advertisers for
the games. ' A

Myslinski, a member ofthe CFA‘s
executive board. said he would like
to see the reorganization convention
to meet "sooner. but under the
NCAA constitution. a special con-
vention can be scheduled no sooner
than 60 days after it is announced in

“order to allow schools to prepare.

Could the NCAA be calling the
CFA‘s bluff to go ahead with the
contract? ' S

With the biggest win in the history
of Pitt women’s volleyball already
under their belts, the i981 Pan-
therette‘volleyball team is already
off to a promising start.

The women’s season got under-
way Aug. 23, opening with a West
Coast trip. Pitt lost three of those
four matches. However,‘ the.trip’s
highlight was Pitt's defeat of eighth-
ranked Pepperdine University, one
of the strongest teams in the nations.
it was a victory Coach Shelton Col-
lier cited as “the biggest ever in the
history of the women‘s volleyball
program," . V P

The Pepperdine win was the only
time a team from the East has
defeateda national power from the
West. Since eight of the i0
nationally-ranked teams are located
in California, Collier feels West
Coast trips are essential if Pitt and
other eastern teams are going to
break the West’s current stronghold
in women‘s volleyball.

Experience should be a great asset
to the 1981 Pantherette squad. Col-
lier has five starting players return-
ing, and eight of last year’s top nine.

Three notable seniors head the list
of returning stars: Paula Olsen, this
year’s captain and last year’s MVP;
Linda Stadler, one ofthe most dom-
inant middle blockers in the East,
according to Collier; and Maria
Perez, a standout in her previous

“Hey, Dexter, what’s the
play." a Pitt varsityplayer asked
Panther wide/‘receiver Dexter
Edmonds as he lined up near the
sideline and awaited the snap.

“Eight—four," Edmonds said,
darting a glance toward the
sideline.

Pitt assistant coach Bob
Matey, off—duty for Monday‘s
game, stepped out from the clus-
ter of people further down the
sidelines and sharply lectured
Edmons on the art of secrecy.
The varsity players looking on
howled with laughter.

You have to learn somewhere.
Like on Monday.

‘It helps because it‘s a game
situation,“ said freshman Mike
Huwar, a quarterback turned
free safety since coming to Pitt.
“its definitely a learning expe-
rience. l haven’t played_ a game
since high school, so it's a chance
to see what you can do here."

Or what ‘you can't. Like any
other game, films are taken and
later scrutinized by Pitt’s coaches
so they can look for some
improvement or some talent they
might have missed. Howa player

performs in ajunior varsity game

sometimes determines how much
action he eventually sees in a var-
sity -game. “it (filming) helps us
evaluate them and gives us a look

Pitt assistant coach Andy

confusing the opposition,” she said.
“ln comparison to last year’s
offense, which was very conservative
and high percentage, this years
should be much more exciting and
effective."

The ultimate goal ofthe l98l Pan-
therette volleyball team is to regain
the Eastern Championship title they
won in i978 and 1979. Going after"
last year’s tournament, Pitt was the
No. I seed after compiling a 28-3
season record, by far the best in the
East.

But Pitt was upset in the regional
tournament by Penn State, the even-
tual champion. This year, Pitt will
host the regional tournament, and
the team intends to use the home
court to their advantage in their
quest to regain the Eastern title, and
to gain national prominence.

Collier described what it will take
to reach tose goals. ‘

Pitt Hopes
Run High .
For ’81 Year

By ‘GEORGE SEMKO

Pm News Sports Writer

The Pitt cross country team is
undergoing a facelift. A change that
should make the team stronger in
years to come. According to head
coach Mike Agostinella the change»
will be gradual, but efficient.

“Naturally, this can’t. happen
overnight,” Agostinella explained,
“We’ll be better this year than last,
better next year and the year after."

Both Agostinella and Mel Boyd--—
who is in charge of distance
looking forward to
this season. According to Boyd, the
1981 edition is the strongest he’s
coached in four years. The reason
for all the optimism is due to middle
distance runners. Bill Moorehead
and Todd Colas. plus a fine set of

distance runners. \

The Panthers open their season at
the California (State) invitational
on Sept¢l2. Pitt will then host the
Eastern Eight Cross Country
Championships Sept. 26 on their
home course of Schenley Park.

Optimism appears to be the key
word in describing this year's edition
of the men’s cross country team.
With some (outstanding returning"
personnel, the only way to go isup.
according to."Mike Agost'inella._ The 
facelift is right on schedule.

Pitt Finishes Off Gannon, EyesGrove City ,

 .<q5a~:,

 

By LISA GREN EVICKI

Pitt News Sportswriler

K.

The Panther soccer team played
with intensity as they convincingly
defeated the Gannon Knights Wed-

._nesday 4~l in the Panthers’ opening

game of the season.

The Pitt booters dominated

almost the entire game against a '

tough and skilled Gannon team.

“Gannon came out to play," said
coach Lea Bemis. “They played hard
and made us work as a team.“ Bemis
has been stressing a much needed
scoring attack, and on Wednesday
he saw it come alive.

Junior winger Eric Tiedtke had
two goals, showing he may have
regained the scoring touch he had in
the first half of last season. Tiedtke
led Pitt in scoring last season.

Senior midfielder Al Adelmarin
drew first blood against Gannon
when he booted apenalty kick past
goalie Nick Sala. Pitt’s next score
came from freshman Sherlunde
“Sparky” Lucke, who entered the
game and played exceptionally well
at the wing position.”

Trom Trempus controls the ball just as the Panthers controlled Gannon Wednesday,
allowing only two shots on goal in Pitt’s 4-1, win.

Other freshmen who earned

Bemis’ praise were local products I

Dan Zemanski of Upper St. Clair
and Jim Steele of Washington, Pa.

“The freshmen are really coming
along," said Bemis. “There’s no let

down in performance when they
enter the game.”
The single Gannon goal came in

the second half, when the Knoghts’,

lift winger drilled the ball past Pitt
goalie Scott Thunberg. Thunberg

was seldom tested throughout the
game. thanks to the Pitt defense
which limited Gannon to just two
shots on goal the entire contest. Pitt
was led on defense by sweeper Don
Bowen, who stopped many Gannon

Pitt’s next opponent is Grove City

“Last year’s defeat made Grove
City mad,” said Bemis. “They’re
going to come down here with a lot
of motivation and they want to beat
Pitt.“

Grove City has the team to give
the Panther squad a tough time.
They will be returning nine letter-
men, including forwards Paul Sauer
and Scott Pennell, who each

recorded six goals and four assists  .
last season. Frank Cerminara will be

“For most of the game we domi-

In Opener

  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

Although the Pitt Lady Panther
tennis team lost to West Liberty
State 5-4 Tuesday, head coach
George Diffenbach still foundmany
positive signs in his team's
performance.

According to Diffenbach, the
Lady Panthers did well considering
that school had just begun and that
rain inhibited many practice
sessions. 6

The rnatchstarted well for Pitt as
No. 1 singles player Randi Belkin
easily handled Beth Robinson 6-4,
6-l. Following the seniors opening
victory came another Lady Panther
win, this one Cathy Jacobson, the
No.2 singles player, over West Lib-
erty State’s Lisa Campanell. Jacob-
son easily handled her opponent 6-2,
6-4.

. But the Lady Panthers were not as
lucky in the next two matches, as
both Lisa Weinberg and Jan Cas-
tory lost their contests.

No.3 singles player Weinberg suc-H

cumbed to Janice Vanwyck in a tight
' match 4-6, 7-6, 6-0. Then Jan Cas-
tory, who plays out of the No. 4
singles position fell to West Liberty
freshman Rhea Dumas 2-6, 4-6.

The Lady Panthers gained a 3-2
team lead after No. 5 singles player
Jody Mattioli defeated Sheila Rose
-4-6, 6-3, 6-3. West Liberty, however,
came right back to notch the score at

A 3-3 with a victory in the sixth singles
match when Beth Thompson

’ defeated Pitt’s Myriam Goltz 7-5,
6-2. 0' A

lt was in doubles play where West
Liberty won the match. After Pitt’s
Belkin and Jacobson defeated
Robinson and Dumas 6-1, 6-2, the
Lady Panthers never won another.
West Liberty captured the victory by
taking the next two doubles
matches: Campanell and Rose
defeated Castory and Mattioli, and
Thompson and Vanwyck triumphed
over Pitt’s Goltz and Beth

‘ Baughman.

Even though his Lady Panthers
lost, Diffenbach expressed opti-
mism about his team. He singled out
Belkin and Jacobson for their play.
Diffenbach also hinted that there
would be switches in his team
alignment.

Not having seen his team practice
for a long time due to the recent bad
weather, Diffenbach 1S anxious to
get a good long look at his club;

pennant
dwelling Pittsburgh Pirates, even
though Manager Chuck Tanner
keeps shooing away the undertaker.

By The Associated Press

Some have already buried the
chances

Yet Tanner. the eternal optimist.
concedes the Pirates are in a deper-
ate situtation going into this wee-
three-game, series with
Philadelphia.

“We have to sweep the Phillies,”
Tanner said with a note of finality
after two straight losses to the New
York Mets blemished a modest four-
game winning strea_l__t....

_ s . .
“lt’s very important. Every game
. is crucial," he added.

 Tanner: Bucs Not Done

Disbelievers point out that the
Pirates have slipped from world
champions to National League East
doormats injust two years. the team
is eight games below .500 in the post-
strike season, and the Pirates would
have to win I5 oftheirfinal 22just to
break even.

of the cellar-

However, no other team is run-

ning away with the division. So des-

pite their failures, the Pirates are still
5'/2 games behind St. Louis.

“We’re still in it.” insisted Tanner.
“But we have to win. We have to
start getting our streak going. lt’s
anybody‘s race.

“You might see a team win the
division at .500, or just a couple of.
games over. I wouldn’t be surprised
ifit came down to the last week with

maybe three or four clubs or maybe
everybody it. If we get a streak
going. it‘s going to be so crowded at
the top, they won't know which way
to go." the Pirate manager added.

Third baseman Bill Madlock,’
locked in a struggle with Philadel-
phia‘s ageless Pete Rose for a batting.
crown, also sees the weekend as Pitt-
burgh’s last gasp.

“If we win three aginst the Phil-
lies, that's a good sign. We’ve got to
win at least two out of the three,"_.

said Madlock, who has a .339 aver-J:

age and a five-point cushion on
Rose.

“You’re not out of it until you're
mathematically out. But if we don’t
win two out of three over the wee-
kend, maybe we better start thinking
about ’82,” he added.
