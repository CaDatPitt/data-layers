Nixon Cutbacks Cause
GSPH Budget Problem

‘ by DAVID ENZELI 3.,
President Nixon's~proposed,budget for fiscal 1974 provides for cut-
backs in federal funding for health and education programs. For the
Graduate School of Public Health (GSPH) the proposed cutbacks

.-a

would represent about seven per cent of its annual budget. This -

amounts to $400,000. which is used exclusively for faculty salaries.
A spokesman for GSPH stated that this cut represents a "very

‘serious budget problem."

The school has already initiated a job

freeze’; "as vacancies occur we won‘t fill the positions. that will save »

money. But that won't make up the .$400.000."

man.

said the GSPH spokes-

The University is trying to obtain additional funds from the state.
In a message to the University community, Chancellor Posvar noted,
‘/‘We are, of course, making an all out effort in Washington, in associa-
tion with other groups, to help rally’ national support for health and edu-
cation. We think there is a much better possibility of advancing in Har-
risburg a special argument for state support of our Graduate School
of Public Health, which is one of the finest in the nation, the only such
school in Pennsylvania, and a worthy asset to the Commonwealth.” - A
The GSPH spokesman noted. "There is no liklihood- that the school
‘is going to close up." While GSPH is experiencing .a budget problem.
there is ‘every ieason to believe that the schoolwillcontinue to be of
- service to the/community. ' " *

Various tests are also being
performed on the compounds to
gain statistical evidence con-
cerning their advertising claims.
For instance, one brand of aspirin
promises to dissolve faster than
rival brands; if this is proven
then, that brand will be a “super-

only differences are in how fast,

We are trying to determine if the

the procedure and the mystery
which surrounds the practice.
Throughout his presentation.
Tenicela stressed that the main
stumbling blocks to a ready ac-
ceptance-of acupuncture lie inits

v lack of scientific principle or ex-

planation. I

» Typifying this attitude of con-
trolled but open-minded skepti-
cism was Dr. Ralph Wilde, presi-
dent of the Pennyslvania Medical
Society. Acupuncture, he said,
does not appeal to Western phy-

sicians who are accustomed to’

systematic, scientific investiga-
tion. '
Although several state chapters
of the American Medical Associa-
tion tAMAi have issued directives
on tltepractice. the AMA has not
yet surfaced with"a definitive.
statement. This hesitancy. Wilde
stated. was related to a lack of

knowledge on the practice.

Western physicians balk. he
said. at accepting the idea that
"man is a microcosmos. subject
to the‘ ebbs and tides of energy
flows."

Wilde also cited the division of
organs into “ying” and “yang”
(good and bad), the concept of
“meridians” or pathways, and
the number of needle insertion
points, as being unscientific. ‘

“It doesn't quite come through
to me as a scientific investigator
that any science is determined
by the days in the year." said
Wilde. ”

Previously Tenicela explained
that the number of puncture sites

has grown as the science has
aged. but that the original num-
ber was thought to be 365-a num-
ber obviously related to the days
in the year.

“I am somewhat concerned,”
he. continued, “with several as-
pects of acupuncture.” First, he
said, there is the danger that a
delay caused by acupuncture
treatments might endanger con-
ventional diagnosis " and treat-
ment.  ~

Wilde also warned that acu-
puncture has proven to be some-
thing which is readily seized by
occultists and. the. AMA fears,

I tigations. heicontinued. should be. “"i
made by a multi-disciplined ap- 5 .-

 

chiropractors. For example acu-e
puncture seminars lasting three .

days and costing $500 are al-
ready being offered throughout
the country.

In concluding. Wilde stated that
for these reasons acupuncturists
should be willing to submit their
practice to an “objective analyses
of its efficacy by well-controlled
statistical analysts." These inves-

Legislatures Considering Reinstatement

T Death Penalty Re—evaIuated

by LOUISE COOK
Associated Press Writer

_ Legislatures in almost two-thirds of the 50
__states are considering measures to reinstate the
death penalty. and lawmakers in four other states
already have passed bills bringin

punsishment.

The Supreme Court ruled last July. in cases in-,
volving Georgia and Texas. that the death penalty.
as imposed in most states. was unconstitutional.
The 5-4 court ruling left the way open for legisla-

,tures to reimpose the death penalty. providing it

was applied uniformly.

An Associated Press survey showed that the
question of capital punishment was an issue in al-
most every state. Most of the proposals provided
execution as the punishment for killing a police-
man or fireman, for airplane hijacking and for vari- ,
ous types of ‘murder, including murder committed
during the course’ of another crime-

“Our interpretation is that the Supreme Court is
not barring the death penalty if it is mandatory;"
‘said Sheldon Beychok. chairman of a special Louisi-
ana commission on capital punishment. "That is."
he added. "the penalty must be imposed on both the
richman and the poor man." No action

taken on the commission report.

death penalty mandatory for certain crimes. The,__
bill passed the House by a narrow margin and is «
pending in the state Senate. ~ y '-

a death penalty may be imposed—as premeditated-

"We do not know exactly where";

Vanetta summed up the poss:

"It warrants investigation  ands?--.

There are several bills pending in many states. ‘
Nine different proposals‘ are on file in Nevada, for,’

mandatory death penalty only for slayings of; _law-!

execution for any one of 10 different kinds of killings.‘

Project In Non-sexist Education

by DEBBIE POPP

The South Hills National Organ-
ization of Women (NOW) Nursery
School is determined to provide
for its students a primary educa-
tion free of sexist and racial prej-
udices.

Ms. Irene Scharpentier. admin-
istrative director of the school.
maintains. "Children are free of
sexist and racial prejudices. It is
only when the adult says ‘no-no‘
and impresses his values that the
child develops these prejudices."

Under this assumption the
school has equipped itself with
nonsexist educational material
and qualified teachers and assis-
tants who,agree with the school’s
philosophy. According to Schar-
pentier this was not an easy task.

,Honors Taken by Debotors I

lost in semi—finals to Niagra Uni-
versity.

Finally, at Bowling Green State
University junior Ken Simon and
senior Charles Camic represented
Pitt at one of the most excluisve
debate tournaments in the nation
where only 18 schools receive in-
vitations. Camic and Simon were
heard by 16 judges, 14 of whom
voted for Pitt. Only Emory Uni-
versity received more votes.

The January-February vic-
tories bring to 18 the number of
tournaments in which Pitt teams
have placed among the finalists.

Her staff had to dig and research
for appropriate material. She
maintains that 90 per cent of chil-
dren’s literature deals with boy
and boy’s animals. She claims
sexual roles are emphasized “by
illustrations of little girls in pink
dresses reciting little nursery
rhymes.”

In searching forplay materials.
the administrative director said.
"We hunted for materials that
children could use that were stur-
dy. usuable. and non—sexist." She
cited as an example of an unsatis-
factory warning device. a clock
with a little boy _painted on it. It
was rejected because the staff
felt. "It would take three times
as long for a little girl to be at-
tractedas it would for a boy."
Scharpentier added. "Adults do
not realize the strong reaction
that children have to such adver-
tising." ‘

In place of the traditional play
kitchen found in most nursery

schools. the Sough Hills school

has a water area fitted withfun-

nels. small tubs. and _cups. This’

apparatus provides an ‘atmos-
phere where the childrer play to-
gether. and eliminates the kitch-
en and the discriminating impli-
cations that only girls play in a
kitchen.

for non-sexist teachers with theo-
retical and practical training.

In a nursery school like South
Hills‘ NOW nursery school which
operates year round and handles
the children from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m..
Scharpentier believes. "It was ad-
vantageous for the teacher to be
adept in sports and nutrition plan-
ning in addition to having the
basic knowledge of art and music.
She also stressed the importance
of the ability of the teacher to re-

late firmly yet gently-to the in-

dividual student.

Because the nonsexist en-
vironment at the school often dif-
fers from the home environment,
the school’s administration often

holds parent-teacher conferences .

to alleviate the child’s continual
readjustment and to discuss the
philosophies of child rearing.

"Many parents express sur-
prise" at the rapid pace their

pentier said.

ed that a kindergarten be formed
to continue the non-sexist educa-
tion.

The problems encountered by
this extension of the small nur-
sery school are formidable.
Scharpentier reported, “Just to
revise one reading textbook alone
would cost three million dollars.”

In May, eight NOW chapters will
confront these problems at the
regional ‘conference on "How to
Deal with and Develop Nursery

Schools.“

  Homes for Retarded
Attrdct Pitt Volunteers

Two new residential centers in the East End of Pittsburgh are de— 0‘

veloping non-institutional patterns of care and training for retarde(_l
children which involve extensive use of volunteers. Pitt students‘. vol-
unteering through the Pitt YMCA. are working at Haven,House in
Point Breeze and will help staff Horizon Home in East Liberty when it
opens in a few weeks. ,

In pioneering new patterns of care for the mentally retarded.
these residences are providing a home-like atmosphere so that as the
child develops he learns that he has abilities to function on his own.

In providing a near-normal stituation, the homes will, it is believ- .. '0 -0' 0

Apparent Cynic

Dear Editor: ,.

Rich Kienzle’s cynicism in his
February 21. 1973 article about
late night rock shows was appar-
ent, his lack‘ of credible ‘know-
ledge was. too. In one of his few
complimentary paragraphs. he
complimented Billy Paul. who
hit a particularly sour note at
the beginning of “Me,and Mrs.
Jonesf‘

He failed to note that _In Con-
cert and Midnight Special are
presented with two completely
different formats. Also, he didn’t
know_ that a Loggins and Mes-
sina concert starts out with Ken-
ny Loggins and his guitar, then
later the rest of the group joins
him, one by one.

These are just a couple of his
shortcomings. The article should_

. have been labled "opinion." May-

be for‘ your next review. you,‘

should find "someone with some

Gremlins Realistic

Editor. The Pitt News:

With regard to the letter by Mr.
John "Burgan concerning the anti-
Nixon sentiments of Pitt News
cartoonist Gene Mater. I would
like to say’that Mr. Mater’s car-
toons may be very highly opin-
ionated and critical but the_v are
far from irrelevant and unrealis-
tic..‘as he so states. Mr. Burgan
criticizes M-r—. Materfor portray-

a ing Nixon as a dictator; but any-

one familiar. with. the current-
dispute between the legislative
and executive branches of our
government would be aware that
many congressmen feel Nixon has
all but achieved these dictator-
ial powers with regard to foreign -
policy and domestic economic
policy. Not stopping there how-
ever. Nixon refuses to support
a bill guarding the anonymity of
persons revealing information to
reporters and he has made a less
than veiled’ threat to television
stations around the country to
the effect that they mustbe re-
sponsible ' for their programing
(i.e. don't broadcast any "irres-
ponsible” criticism of the Nixon
administration) or (‘risk losing

their licenses. These are very

poorly disguised inroads into con-
trol of the media and suppression
of the public’s right to know.

But if at night Mr. ‘Burgan
finds sleep elusive because his
poor Dicky has been ridiculed
and 'slandered by some subver-
sive cartoonist he can take con-
solation in the fact that tomor-
row he can go out and by_a copy
of that sports, cartoon and diet
daily that masquerades as the
Lighthouse of‘ the Steel City,
The Pittsbbrgh Press. ' Complete
with the list of the day’s muggings
and lost dogs, he will find politi-
cal cartoons so varied, fair and
imaginative that he will wonder
if Joseph Goebbels is really dead.
Add to this, many fiery editorials
crying for pothole legislation and
support for Nixon, the reader
will find that even the few
times the iron-willed editors, (pil-
lars of personal, conviction) dis-
agree with Nixon they still sup-
port him because . . .- . well just
because. (Are you listening Hugh
Scott?)

day. but then. with the collection
of 400 pages of adds you also get

Diversity of
Experience

Dear Editor: A
, It seems to me that the emplla—
sis of student life at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh should be ob-
taining a diversity of experience
during the four or five short
years that they spend in college.
An experience which I would
like to suggest to students is one
of intercultural living. Presently
there are two programs; one in
the University dorms being spon-
sored ‘bythe Office of Resident
Life and the other being the In-
tercultural House on Dithridge
Street. ‘ '

In my experiences" at the In-
tercultural House on Dithridge
Street I have realized that the in-
tercultural' experience is not lim-.
ited to, those believing; in a world
view that blacks and whites
should live together via integra-
tion, there are mechanism to pro-
mote communication among var-
ious astranged groups
country, -racism is the predomin-
ate problem in this country or
that Whites should feel guilty
about past and present existence
of racism-——the’~fact. is that there
are twenty different perspectives,
opinions’ and world views. But
there‘ are also twenty students
interested in exploring interra-
cial and intercultural‘issues—_ that-
providesan experience— an in-
teresting experience. -I only hope

" that while it is_nov_v time to ap-
jply for both programs for the;

coming school year, that students
will take full advantage of these

opportunities. to become part of-

a unique learning environment.

Then I wonder why I'm going to Pitt. aild begin to be ver_v cri-
tical of everything and everybody associated with the school. espe-

Usually the end result of one of these mental sessions is a strong
desire to abandon my liberal education and join a computer manage-

coat and the opportunity to press thousands of pretty buttons?

-Luckily. I snap out of these fitswhenever I realize that ‘I have

Recently. though. one such thinking attack ended wlieil I re-

"Dear George. ‘

“If you’re,wonderii_lgAwh~y'I haven’t written for so long, you
can credit my latest change in life-style. That is to say, I abandoned
my lackluster existence as an apathetic student for the exciting ways

Something happened the other
day that really set me thinking.
The newscaster on a local radio
station prefixedva woman’s name
with the term "Ms.“ And there I
was, thinking that the news me-
dia were -resisting such arbitrary
introductions to the English voca-
bulary.

No doubt about it, women's lib
/is making itself felt, despite some
problems ‘within the movement.
The nonsense. of bra-burning. the
high visibility of lesbian mem-
,bers. and the heated anti-male

‘a volume of adverse publicity
which wouldvhave buried a weaker
movement. A .

(At this point I feel I should
mention that some of the more re-
actionary feminists will object to
a male having anything‘ to say

about this subject. They assume.

that men are all de facto know-

nothings on such matters. This is.

absurd. Very few women sports-

casters have ever swung at a,

curve ball, yet they seem to do
pretty well on the job. Despite

_their handicap.) .
" ‘’ Women’s liberation may not
“change interplanetary physics or

the structure of the atom, as it

seems Betty Friedan would have

‘. us believe. It will, however, insti-

gs.

tute change in our culture and the
relationships that can exist ‘be-

rhetoric all gleaned for feminism .

tween people. and such changes
are not to be taken lightly.

‘ Among the most visible of_the
movements effects has been its
most trivial — the unfortunate
impact on the language. To the
feminists we owe "credit“ for
such linguistic abominations as
"chairperson." Some feminists
would even like to see the divine
“He" changed to "She." What sill-
iness. All these changes do is give
the feminine ego a boost at/every-
body‘s expense.

And this Ms. business. The de-
luded women that use this term as
a title should all be on commis-
sion, receiving a small amount of
money every time they sign their
name. From whom? Obviously
from the New York based mag-

azine ofthie same name. The one '

that has latched on to the clever-
est‘ publicity gimmick’ of the ‘de-
cade.

Now pending in statehouses
across theynation is the "Wom-

ien‘s Rights" amendment tothe
.U.S. Constitution. Its impact will

be minor. There are currently
enough broad-reaching ‘laws on
the books to force almost every
institution tohheed the feminists
cry for equal treatment-I Major

employers are applying quota sys--
-- terns to new hiring. Quotas which

highly favor female applicants.
AT&T has been clobbered with a
court order to make restitution to
its female employees who have

been receiving low salaries. Just
like the linguistic changes. the
superfluous amendment will
serve merely as a bandage on the
long-bruised self-confidence of the
weaker sex.

Changes in the attitudes of em-

ployers are important. however.

Many a male worker or student is
working at new high levels of pro-
ductivity in a vain attempt to beat
a quota system. What is going to
happen as the work force swells
with "liberated" females?

Quotas aren't the answer. How
many men with an unliberated

T wife and a couple of kids at. home

are going to be out of work be-
cause they don’t fit into a quota?
Selection by‘ qualification, yes.

"Quotas?

The effect of women‘s lib on
family life is almost unpredict-
able. The family unit in western
society. is changing so rapidly for
other reasons (the rise of techno-
logy. the obliteration of class dis-
tinctions. etc.) that any change

due to women's lib will be hard.

to recognize if and when it occurs.

‘Another change that some ex-
perts feel will occur is a drop in
the female life expectancy (which
now exceeds that of males) as

pressures rise on women to suc-_
‘ ceed financially and socially. They

may begin to realize the load that
men have carried for centuries.

A more severe burden of this
type will be placed on the “unlib-
erated” woman. How many wom-
en who garner a great amount
of happiness from homemaking
and from raising a family will feel
falsely and unjustly incomplete
when they compare themselves
with the climbing executive fe-
males of the future? Feminists
will argue that a person cannot
exist whose goals in life are so

“simple.” A little look around will

reveal otherwise.

One great contribution women‘s
liberation will make is a rapid in-

NEW YORK (AP) — The possi-

bility of Hollywood studios mak-
ing feature films specifically for
public television was under close

i- study last year by the Public

Broadcasting Service, PBS offi-
cials say.

Feature Films Proposed for Public TV

However. both the ideas and
the still-unfinished study current-
ly are in limbo and face a doubtful
future.

This, the officials say, is. be-
cause of' uncertainty over what
role PBS will have in the future of
the national programming for
public television.

Last January. the parent cor-
poration for Public‘ Broadcasting
in effect stripped PBS of pro-

gramming power it previously en— '

joyed when the corporation pri-
marily served as an administra-
tive unit that. passed on yearly
congressional appropriations to
PBS. —

PBS“ Hollywood study. begun
nine months ago. stemmed from
concern by PBS officials that
there soon would be a growing
shortage of "product.“ according
to a PBS spokesman.

He referred to one-shot feature
programs for national public TV,
mostof them filmed or taped
abroad because of lower costs.
Many of these shows were made
under co-production agreements
with
Corp.

“What was happening was that
we were running into a shortage
of product aboard and we wonder-
ed if there might be a way of pro-
dducing this kind of quality show
here at minimal cost." he said.

Education Disputestleld at Pitt

the British Broadcasting '

Top public television officials
eventually will have to consider

-Hollywood as a source of films for

national public television. the PBS
spokesman contended.

V “We just do not have sufficient
product,” he said. “It would be
nice to think the individual televi-
sion stations themselves could
come up with product.

“But my personal feeling is that
it's very doubtful. I don’t think
they‘re ever going to have suffi-
cient funds to do it." 

  Researchers {View School Spending

have questioned the worth of cur-
rent school spending and deseg-
regation attemps. a radical jour-

Xnalist. and a controversial educa-,

Sailors Memorial in Oakland,
worked at Harvard with Dr.
Christoper Jencks to help pro-
duce Inequality: A Reassessment

Himes Displays /vlusicianship

By ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Student recitals always re-
veal two things: what a student
has learned and what a student
has not learned. An organ recital
by student Douglas D. Himes
«'74) yesterday at Heinz Chapel
provided ample material for both
of these criteria.

While Himes showed that he
was at least comfortable at the
console. his program selections
were trite and sometimes ‘tacky’.
Opening with the A.Major Fan-
tasia of Franck. we all very quick-

ly -became aware that the artist .

was having difficulty in holding
the piece together. '

“Quite frankly, it was not al-
ways Himes’. fault- who could
denyithat the Franck is a horribly
constructed" piece- of music?
Bringing this composition off
requires nothing short of- a mira-
cle. Unfortunately, however, that
miracle did not occur -yesterday

afternoon.

The sluggishness of the program
continued with the "Suite Breve”
of Langlais. Here. the audience
was at least partially revivified
by the ‘cutesy’ nature of the
Suites Dialogue sur les Mixtures.

_ Closing out the program was
-that perennial favorite l'?‘?t
which provides Westminster
chimes a la francais, Louis Vier-
ne‘s "Carillon de Westminster."
Despite the work’s triteness.

many an audience is full pleased

by its rather grandiose conclu-
sion (as it was in Tuesday's con-
cert).

Throughout the recial. Himes.
despite the fact that he was unable

—to formulate an interesting pro-

gram. showed himself promising
in the realm of musicianship. His
programwas pleasant enoughbut
hardly profound. A repeat of the
program is scheduled for Sunday
at 3 p.m. withadditional works of
Reger- Brahms. and Clerembaud.

The Isle of Man was the birth-._ »

L'Anfortunately. last Sunday night at the Alpine lce Chalet.
the Pitt Hockey Clu_bran up_against one of those exceptions.

The game against Carnegie-Mellon was without a doubt the
most important game ‘of the regular season for Pitt’. The City

. Division ,title was on the line and a capacity crowd ft-lled-the Al— ’

pine to watch the two best teams in the W-PIHA battle it out.
Referee James Armstrong turned the game into a circus. That's

all there is to it.‘ . l
t."\

Armstrong obviously didn’t belong on the ice, mainly be-

causehis knowledge offfhe game leaves much to be desired.
Now don’t misconstrue the intentions of this column. There are
noexciises to be made for, the Pitt skaters. The fact is-that any
, team will have a tough time defeating its opponents when they

have to confront the referee also.

Armstrong. began his string of incompetent calls whenhe
disallowed a Pitt goal midway through the first period. He ruled
that Denny’Browne intentionally kicked the puck intothe net.

a definite infraction.

According to Browne. the puck was shot toward the net and
deflected off his knee and then past C-MU goaltender Jeff Hart.
Armstrong made thecall obviously because he was not in the
rightfposition to make the right one. When the play occurred.
he was on the extreme left wing boards. about five‘ feet inside

‘ the blue line. Besides Browne. there were at least three other

people in front of the net. 5

‘How Armstrong could see the play to make the call is be-

yond me. But then again, it doesn’t surprise me that he proved
hisincompetence. He is notorious around the local college hock-

ey circuit for his inadequacy as a league official. In fact, even-

the Pittsburgh high school league hasucomplained about him.

Once Pitt took the lead over C-MU. the skaters went‘ about
to establish themselves in their normal fasltion. Thatis; by

playing their normally rouglt style with the emphasis on play-.-;

‘ing the body instead of the puck. 'l'his style of play. when used
correct/ly. is perfectly"1egal and most effective. Armstrong.
however. seemingly doesn't think there is a place for a good.
bruising check in the game and he has repeatedly shown his

dislike for Pitt. '

Armstrong ignored the ‘tact that Pitt players were being
.-/stripped. held. "slashed and elbowed every time they started a

‘to

' rush up ice. Instead he called 10 minors on Pitt. ranging from

kneeing to butt ending. These are indeed infractions of the rules
but did not necessarily effect the flow of the. game. Those penal-
ties he called on Pitt put. the skaters down a man for o\ er a
third of the game. a game that meant quite a bit. 3 '

a When Armstrong called Kerry Browne off -the ice late in

the third-period, the usually mildmannered defenseman‘ and".

assistant captain -shad tobe held back by the linesma_n.~Arm-
strong is lucky Browne didn’t get ahold of him. i 

As a member of the Pitt Hockey Club. 1 filed an otiiciai
complaint to Sam Orr. the league commissioneer. requesting
that Armstrong not be .used to ofticiate attany more contests

Five Gymnasts
Go To Easterns

by RON SIEGEL

A possible five Pitt gymnasts will compete in the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Gymnastic League this weekend at Temple.

Coach Warren Neiger and his charges left today for Philadelphia
and will work out at Temple. The competition gets underway tomor-
row; team championships will be Friday. and individual champion-
ships are scheduled for Saturday afternoon.

The first three individual qualifiers in each event. as well as the

team championship. will qualify to compete in the Nationals. which will
be held at the University of Oregon March 22-24.

Pitt’s strongest hope formaking it to the Nationals is Dick Pribis, .

but even he is considered a longshot by Neiger. Pribis will "be compet-
ing in two events, the floor exercise“ and the vaulting.

Also competing for Pitt will be Chris Gardner in the floor excer-
cise. Lee Lilly and Bob Rodgers on the side horse. and possibly Dan
Can Campbell, vaulting. «

"You should take a full team." explained Neiger. "But we're just
taking those boys who can score eight or above. and who really want to
go. Lack of depth has been our problem all season."

Neiger added that if any Pitt gymnast does qualify for Nationals,
he definitely will go, adding, “Up until two years ago Pitt has always
had somebody in the Nationals.”

"The last Pitt gymnast to reach the Natio'nals was Lowell Meeke.

who was‘ an Eastern champion. He didn‘t place in the Nationals. but he,

did perform well."

The season was disastrous from a won-loss point of view. as Pitt
was not victorious in 10 meets. "It's‘- been a long season." grimaced
Neiger. "It's really rough to go through a season like that.“

A ; “It was gratifying to see some of the boys improve individualy,
though,” he went on. “We just didn’t have enough men. Everybody we

took to Army did quite well.”

Many dedicated Pitt gymnasts will be graduating after this sea-
son, but in spite of this. Neiger is optimistic about next, season's squad.
."It‘s going to bean improved team." he predicted.

Pitt‘s rifle team came in third place in a sectional tournament
held at Pitts Trees Hall this past weekend. A total of 20 teams partici-
pated in the tournament. -

Clarion State College finished first with a score of 1055 and was
followed by Indiana University of Pennsylvania with 1033. Pitt was just
11 points behind with 1022. Carnegie-Mellon was bested by Pitttby just
one point, finishing fourth. ‘

The riflers have just one more match remaining this season.
against the Duquesne Dukes on Thursday.

Pitt's women’s basketball team will try to stay above the .500
mark tomorrow when it ‘plays host to California State College in the
women’s gym at Trees Hall. Coach Sandra Bullman’s charges are 4-3,
and after the 6 p.m. clash tomorrow, closes out the season on Saturday
by visiting Westminster College at New Wilmington.

The final hockey game of the regular season takes place Sunday
night at 8 p.m. at the Alpine Ice Chalet. Busses will leave from the Stu-

the game will be a rematch of two teams that fought bitterly earlier
this season.

him.

Wallace will be competing in
four events. including the medley.
He is entered in both the 100 and
200-yd backstroke and the 50-
yard free-style.

"Of all the sw'immers." said
Bradshaw "John Templin has the
best chance of excelling in this
meet."

Templin will be looking to beat

Templin is also entered in the 100-
yard breaststroke.

Dave Natali qualified for the
100 and 200—yard butterfly by
the skin of his teeth against Grove
City. He landed right on the mark
he needed to qualify _for his
events. not including the medley.
which he qualified for earlieikin

Eric Schultz is the swimmer
who will only be competing in
the medley relay but his contri-
bution there could be immense
as the free-style can either make
or break a medley relay.

and very comfortable. They have to
be. So you’ll meetus on our trains. It
really is the way to get to know
Europeansin Europe.‘ .

Butthere’s one catch. You
must buy yourstudent-Railpass in I ‘
North America before you go.
They’re not on sale in Europe
because they are meantstric-tly for
visitors to Europe—hence the
incredibly low price. Of course if.

S you're loaded you can buy a regular
Eurallpass meant for visitors of all
ages. It gives you First Class travel it
that's what you want. ‘

Either way if you're going
to zip off to Europe, see a Travel
Agent before" you go, and in the
meantime, rip off the coupon. It
can't hurt and it'll get you a better
time in Europe than you everthought

at.
