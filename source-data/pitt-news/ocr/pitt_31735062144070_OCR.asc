WSSF Drive
Launched
This Week

With Pitt starting its ﬁrst peace-
time American Christmas season

in four years, the World Student
Service Fund has launched its
campaign here for funds to help
provide relief, rehabilitation, and
reconstruction for students and
in the war-hacked
countries of the world.

Every student and professor in
the United States will be asked to
contribute something to this ca-m-
paign. “In order to present the
need of WSSF more convincingly,
the campaign will be conducted
individually at Pitt by solicit-
ors,” said Grant Lee, co-chairman
of the drive. “This, week every
student and faculty member will
be approached individually by a

V volunteer solicitor,” he concluded.

“Dollar A Head; World Ahead”
is the slogan of the drive at Pitt.
Ileana Hutchinson, co-chairman,
“We hope that every Pitt

realize the ‘importance of the

WSSF «and will contribute at least
one dollar
$ 2 ,‘0'0'0,0-0~0 .”
Organized in 1937 as the Far

BohCster Highlights IF Ball,
Sing Teams Compete for Cup  

Tuxes and formals will come out of moth balls for the ﬁrst timev

this year as Pitt takes over the Urban Room of the William Penn
Hotel on Friday evening from 9 to 1 o’clock for the Interfraternity

Ball.

Sponsored by the Interfraternity Council, the dance is formal and
is a closed affair for fraternity men only. Tickets, costing $5.50, may
be obtained at any of the fraternity houses.

Music will be supplied by Bolc¢

Chester’s nationally known orches-
tra. “Chester is well known for
his good music,” said Bob Nagel,
dance chairman. “His newly or-
ganized band, consisting of twenty
pieces, features Mary Woods as
vocalist. With his music in the
oﬁing, we have something to look
forward to.”

The entertainment will feature
the Interfraternity Sing which will
take place during the main inter-
mission. Ten fraternities, includ-

ing the Sigma Chi’s, last year’s,

champions, will compete in the
sing. Each fraternity will sing one
fraternity song in addition to one
song of their own choosing. The
Sing will be judged by Dr. John

M. Ferguson,’ associate professor of i

economics; C. L. Van Sickle, pro-
fessor of accounting; and Dr. Ray-
mond F. Brittain, instructor in the
history of religion. Dick Smith,
president of the IF Council, is
chairman of the IF Sing.

Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity will
be presented formally with the
athletic trophy, which it won for
last years’ achievements in ath-
letics. Walter Stewart, program
chairman, will announce the win-

Bishop Brown
Tours’ Colleges
In Mid-West

Bishop Brown, Director of the
Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing, has returned from a ten-day
trip ,, through the Middle West
where he visited a number of col-
leges. Among the schools visited
were the University of.Michigan,
Michigan State, Kalamazoo Col-
lege, University of Illinois, Purdue,
Earlham College, Richmond, Ind.,
Illinois Wesleyan, "and Wabash
College, Indiana.

At._,the colleges, he met with the
deans of men and women, busi-
ness administration, and vocation-
al counselors. They told him of
the pronounced interest in their
schools about the work the Pitt
Bureau is doing. Since the end of
the war, there has been a great
revival of interest in vocational
training. At each college, he ad-
dressed a number of students.

Mr. Brown mentioned the stu-
dent unions at Ann Arbor and
Illinois Wesleyan which Pitt lacks.
Such unions are the center of ac-
tivity for undergraduate students.
They give an opportunity for stu-
dents to meet with the faculty.
The unions at these two colleges
are so large that they have room
for all types of recreational facili-
ties and dorms for visiting alumni.

Mr. Brown also praised the basic
college curriculum at Michigan
State. It consists of two years of
required courses for all students.

,These courses include: two years

written and oral English (which
they call communications), courses
in physical and biological sciences,
history of civilization, art and
literature, and effective living.
“These courses,” Mr. Brown said,
“are so well blended that they
form a ﬁrm foundation for any
type of further education. Anyone
who can take only, these two years

 has "gained, a great deal.”  4

George Polimus, business man-
ager, said, “The popularity of the
IF Ball was gained by the success-
fulresults that we have had in
previous years, and this dance, be-
ing the ﬁrst post-war formal af-
fair, should make it even more
memorable. We are striving to
make this dance one that will
stand out in the minds of the fra-
ternity men at Pitt,” he. concluded.
According to ticket chairman,
Arnie Steinman, ticket sales are
better than was anticipated. A
large attendance is guaranteed".

“I was without shoes and I murmured, until I met a man

‘without feet.”

This particular phrase was used a number of years ago in
the World Student Service Fund campaign. Yet, today, it brings
into fuller focus’ the reasons why we should coiitinue to con-
tribute to such an 0l‘g‘&ll1lZ8.tl()l'l._ '

The VVorld Student Service Fund has served valiantly "dur-
ing the past year, giving aid to many hundreds of students vic-
tir_n,i,z,ed by. war. Funds from the organization collections have

"been used to obtain surgical instruments for doctors and medical

students; to help prisoners behind barbed wire; and to further
research in the (larl<ened corners of the W0l‘l(l amid bombings,

T ﬁre, epidemics, and other devastating acts of destruction. One

of the major projects of the World Student Service Fund has
been an-individualized book and educational service to prisoners
of.war of all nationalities. lvlany of these students have passed
examinations and received advanced college credit, and even

degrees for the work undertaken diiriiigtheir imprisonment.

Today, war relief is no longer the plea. Although peace is

l in the making there isstill a challenge for us inuniversities and

colleges through the United States to accept. The appalling
needs.-of students in European and Eastern countries are great
and we are urged to take heed of this situation. A special re-

sponsibility rests on us as their fellow-students. Funds from

this year’s campaign willspeciﬁcallyﬁll such needs as provid-

C ing health and service centers where none exist; provide books

and laboratory instruments and other educational tools for the
empty hands of students in many countries. Also, an effort is
being made to repatriate prisoners of war and other internccs
whose health has been undermined or whose education retared
by their experiences. m

At least one million dollars must be raised from the cam-
puses of our universities and colleges. That may sound like a
big ﬁgure, but we must remember we fought a big war. Your
contribution to the Pitt drive will aid the hungry, "ill, poverty-
stricken, bookless, courageous students of all lands.

We should all realize that these young men and women will
be our partners in the rebuilding of this world, but that be-

fore any such reconstru-ction plans can be formulated, the claims

of World VVar II must be paid in full.

  

Reports from the Student Assembly-held last week certainly
made us feel good. Estimated figures show that six hundred stu-
dents and members of the faculty and administration were pres-
ent to listen to Dr. T. Z. Koo. That ’s quite an improvenient over
the 96 persons who attended the ﬁrst assembly. Congratulations,
everyone! .. . ‘

To wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
two Weeks ahead of time may seem a bit odd, but as this is the
last publicationof the Pitt News in 1945, it is our only oppor-'
tunity to send holiday greetings to all students and faculty.

For the ﬁrst time in four years our Christmas spirit. really
has aii air of gayiiess, lightheartedness, in it. The pungent odor
of the spruce trees in the Commons Room excites us to dreams
of glittering tinsel and huge red and green ribbon-tied packages.
But foremost in our minds is the feeling of relief that war‘ is
over, and thatfor a great number of us, this will be the ﬁrst
Christmas since Pearl Harbor that our whole family has sat
down to Christmas dinner together. i 4

Pitt has not escaped this contagious air and we, too, are
grateful that so many Pitt men and women are once again
united.

Thus, amid mingled feelings of excitement and solinenity,

We knew a guy once who wrote

of a lot better on paper than it
works in .practice. This would be a
G.I. who had enrolled in Septem-
ber and is still waiting for his
ﬁrst subsis-tence_ check. to arrive.
Or it might be a guy who went to
the Vets Administration to ﬁnd out
why things were so delayed and
who became so snarled in red tape
and evasions that he left in dis-
gust. No one has been able to ex-
plain to these boys how they are
supposed to exist until their
checks arrive. Borrowing money
isn’t easy for lots of fellows, a
matter of pride is involved. Bor-
rowing under P. L. 346 would try
the patience of a saint and the
Armed Forces were never known
to possess any great numbers of
too saintly‘ characters.

Well, what is going to be done
about the V. A.? May be you are
swamped: with work but even
more men are returning, does that
mean that conditions will get
worse? There never was any great

By Burke and Bucher

This is it. Yep, this is your week

to howl. Naturally we’re address-'

ing the YM, so all you nice YWer’s
can skip down to the next para-
graph. In case you haven’t heard
already, the Triple H (Hubba,
hubba, hub-ba) gang -is addressing
Freshman club tomorrow on “Date
Technique,” in the lounge at 12:30
o’clock.

Now a. hopeful n6’ce~ for YW:
Santa Claus is due at the YW
ofﬁce this Friday for the Christ-
mas party between 2:30 and 5
o’clock. There’s a large rumor
stuck in our pigeon-h-ole that San-
ta has something extra special for
the Y stocking, too. I d-idn’t get
all the details, but it’s something
about a “sergeant and the juke-
box.” Need we say more?

Want to make some money?
Now, now, lassies, let’s not stam-
pede; remember we’re 1adies——or
at least reasonable facsimiles.
Anyhow there’s a big contest be-
ing sponsored by the Women’s
Press with a grand prize of $100.
All you have to do is write an
essay on “The Responsibility of
American Women for the United
Nations Organization.” Simple
enough, so see Mrs. Batz for de-
tails.

w Thus endeth the trivia for this
week. Now on to the really im-
portant item. Naturally, we mean
the World ‘Student Service Fund.
WS.SF needs little explanation by
now, for almost everyone knows
what a great job it di-d during the
past four years in prisoner of war
ramps -and shell-torn universities
all over the world.

The really hard pull, however,
lies in the years of peace ahead.
It’s stark reality that unless the
young men and women of Europe
and Asia have a chance for edu-
cation and training in the ways of
peace that there can be no peace.

The atomic “bomb has shattered‘

the ‘brittle shell of isola-tionism,
and Chinese, American, and Rus-
sian students stand face to face.
We must either work with these
fellow students, or ﬁght them!
Those are the real alternatives.

The choice for the future is up
to us; w-ar or peace are in our
hands. So, if you would live in
a world of s-ecurity, “the peace in
our time,” give now, and give
generously to the World Student
Service Fund—for your own sake,
if for no other reason!

Scholarships

To Oxford
Available

Returning war veterans and
civilian war workers are now eli-
gible for the 1946 Rhodes Schol-
arships for Oxford University, un-
der the War Service Scholarships
recently created by the Rhodes
trustees. The representatives for
Pitt is Dr. Alfred P. James, pro-
fessor of history.

Under the provisions of the War
Service Scholarships are the fol-
lowing requirements for all men
candidates:

1. They must have been be-
tween the ages of 19 and 25 at
any time since October 1, 1940;

2. They must have completed
one year of war service in the
armed forces, or civilian war
service for which the draft
boards granted deferment.

3. They’ must have one year

of college or university work.

The candidates are not barred
from marriage, as in the case of
the regular .appointmen-ts. It is ex-
pected that these scholarships will
be offered for two and possibly
three years. Candidates may ap-
ply for permission to hold their
scholarships for a third year, if
they present a deﬁnite plan of
study for that period satisfactory
to their college and to the Rhodes
trustees.’

Two War Service candidates
and two regular candidates are
nominated by the committee of
selection of each state to appear
before the district committee. The
district committee selects eight
men for representation at the Ox-
ford University. Expenses will be
paid to the candidates who are
sent before the district commit-
tee. '

Pitt’s Latest

By now you are all wondering
what gives with the be—turbaned
individual who appeared on our

This friendly student with the
brilliant smile is Achchhar Singh
from India.

He is the first of a group of
thirteen students to come to Pitt
from India to study. Four-hundred
and twenty students are being
sent to the United States by the
Indian -government to study in
various ﬁelds and in various parts
of the country. In Pittsburgh, be-
sides the thirteen who will study
here, seven will matriculate at
Carnegie Tech.

-Achchhar received his A. B.
from the University of Punjab
in Punjab Province and is doing
graduate study here in the ﬁeld of
Electrical Engineering. He will be
here two years and then will re-
turn to India where he will be un-
der contract to the Indian govern-
ment for ﬁve years. When that
period has elapsed he will be free
to follow‘ his own interests. His
intentions: are to set up an Elec-
trical Works Factory of his own.

‘Born in Afghanistan, Singh has
a small family consisting of his
father, "brother, sister-in-law, and
"their two children. His mother
died seventeen years ago when he
was a boy of ﬁve. This is the ﬁrst
time he has been away from India,
and he does miss getting news
about his homeland, but keeps up

campus on Monday, December 3. _

margin to t-he left while demon-
strating how’ these two languages
are written. He would like to
study another language such as
German or French.

The education system here is
quite like that of the University
of Punjab, except in a few re-
spects. There is no system of
credits. The semesters are longer,
and vacation periods are short.
The school days is from nine un-
til ﬁve .with an hour break for
lunch._.“‘This way we spend more
time in school, and not so much
on outside work, but here not as
much time is given to classwork
and much depends upon outside
study.”

Achchhar likes. Pitt and is well
acquainted with the campus. He is
very much impressed by the na-
tionality rooms and Heinz
Chapel. The rich red and blue
colors in the stained glass win-
dows of the ‘Chapel remind him of
India.

Achchhar has a very serious
personality‘ and is deeply interest-
ed in his country. He sees freedom
as a distan:t goal toward which In-
dia is slowly moving. He is a fol-
lower of Nehru, and worships in
the -Sikh religion.

He commented on American
food by saying “The food. here
has variety, but we eat more vege-
tables and less meat.” He calls
himself a teetotaler, for he neither
smokes, nor drinks.

In addition to that, we are plan-

Recovering from wounds inﬂict-
ed by our over-enthusiastic _fans
We ventured again into the Blue
and gathered the latest on the fra-
ternity front.

Say what goes? Eight boys sur-
vived the Sigma Chi hell week.
Seriously though, congratulations
to Jim ‘Chrissis, Bob Ingram, Bob
Ricci, Earl Humphreys, Vernon
Maury, Frank Balkove, George
Meyer, and John Salvaggio.

At present SAE pledges are in
themidst of their sufferings. But
the actives were big-hearted by
letting them having a last ﬂing at
some social life by having the
Zetas over for a dessert dance last
Monday before applying the pad-
dle.

_ Last Saturday was a pretty pop-
ular day to have pledge dances.
The Pi Lams and Phi Kaps were
making merry through the cour-
tesy of their pledges. Speaking of
the Pi Lams they were hosts to
the Phi Gams at a stag on the
thirtieth.

The topic of conversation down

at the’ Phi Delt corner seems to be

the big time had at the Theta
houseplast Monday.

The Delts were also lucky re-
ciprocants of Theta hospitality at
a recent dessert dance. .

Drifting down from the Pilot
House comes the report of the

merry—making and good fellow-

ship which were present at the
Phi Ep big stag on the seventh.
On the eighth 14 PiKA pledges

had a dance to celebrate their de-“

liverance from the hell week that
passed on into the annals of his-
tory. - _ _ .

Lastfbut not least are the Fijis
who certainly been keeping up in
their p,’s and q’s by being guests
at the Phi Mu dessert dance on the
ﬁfth. Later on the eighth, they had
a hard times dance and ’tis re-
ported that the cellar window was
the entrance. ' _

In closing let’s remember fel-
low fraters that the I-F is this
Friday at the Urban Room. So get
your dancing shoes ready and
your. tuxes pressed and let’s step.

Alright, we’ll go quietly.

It seems the Thetas lead the so- ,

cial parade this week. Monday
evening they had the Phi Delts
over for a dessert dance. They’re
keeping their gowns out after the
IF for their Candlelight formal
on Saturdlay night. Their much
“socialized” vacation will wind up
with a Christmas party for Theta
Mothers at Jane Iam’s home.

The Zetas were guests of the
SAEs at a house dance on Mon-
day, November 10. They also are
filling out their social plans with
an executive formal Christmas
dinner on December 17, when ZTA
Ofﬁcers will plan entertainment for
active chapter.

Theta Phi Alpha is ushering the
Christmas season with a dance at
their house next Wednesday even-

ing. They’re having a real live.

Santa Claus, too. Not to be out
done are the Tri Delts. They have
that “Mrs. Santa” feeling again
this year. ‘So, next Tuesday they
will entertain the orphans of the
Ward Home. Bob «Carroll will be
their Santa.

The Phi Mus will start the
Christmas vacation with a formal
dance at the Highland Country
Club on Wednesday, December
19, in honor of their pledlges.

This must be Founder’s Day
season. Tonight the Beta Sigs are
-celebrating with a dinner at the
Fort Pitt hotel. And the Phi Sigs
are planning a dinner and initia-
tion -of new members at the Rus-
kin apartments on Friday, De-
cember 21 at 6 o’clock. All actives
and also inactive members are in-
vited. ‘They will have movies
after the dinner.

Next Monday the alumni of
Alpha Delta Pi are entertaining
the local chapter. Congrats to
Mary Reilly, the new ADPi
pledge”

Dr. Silverrnan
Lists Hazards

In an effort to help -prevent fur-
ther deaths» from -carbon monoxide
_poisoning, Dr. Alexander Silver-
man, professor of the department
of chemistry, has developed» and
presented« a list of the hazards as
a warning.

The hazards, which should be
avoided by everyone i.n Pittsburgh,
are as follows:

“1. Do not use a gas, oil‘, or
coal stove which is not provided
with a flue that is connected with
the out-of-doors.

“2. The fact that a stove burns
with a clear, blue flame is not al-
ways a guarantee that no harmful
fumes are produced. Carbon mo-
noxide is odorless . . but the
slightest sign o-f a headache by oc-
cupants should be sufﬁlcient warn-
ing.

“3. See that your ﬂue draws
well. 7

“4. Have the gas burners in
your kitchen stove -and other open
heating units examinedl regularly
by the gas company or a plumber
to be sure the air mixers are ad‘-
justed properly and that no fumes
are form=ed. ’

“5. A moderate amount of ven-
tilation is important. '

“6. The car engine should
never be run in a closed garage.”

Christmas cards may be pur-
chased in the book store, ground
ﬂoor, for ﬁve cents each. There
are scenes of the Cathedral of
Learning, the Heinz Chapel, the
ﬁre place in the Commons
Room, and the Nativity Scene
taken in the Commons Room at
Pitt’s Christmas presentation
several years ago.

Pm Ne... Selects

All -America Teami

By Lowell Lubic
For years and years the great “Yogi” sports writers have been
racking their brains attempting to pick a competent All American
spuad. Here goes our 1945 Pitt News All American:

Fullback Felix Blanchard, Army

“Doc” easily rates as the moste

outstanding back in the country.
He charged his way throughthe
best lines in the nation and you
can be sure that they didn’t have
an easy time stopping him.
Halfback Glenn Davis, Army

Whenever the crowds become
bored by Blanchard’s power Davis
showed them a ﬁne example of
some razzle dazzle football.
Halfback -Harry Gilmer, Alabama

This‘ great passer who sparked
Alabama into the Rose Bowl pull-
ed ma-ny -close games out of the
fire with his trust right hand.
Quarterback Herman Wedemayer,
St. Marys -

Herman pushed his team
through one of their best.seasons
with his great triple threat play-
mg.‘

_ End Henry Foldberg, Army

Henry played brilliantly for
Army both offensively and defen-
sively.

Tackle George Savitsky, Penn
The fact that George is 250
pounds dIidn’=t hinder his ability
because he was one .of Penn’s fast-
est linemen.
Guard Warren Amling, Ohio State
Warren led the Buckeyes
throughout the season with his
great defensive playing.
Center Vaughn Mancha, Alabama
“Pancha” backed.up the Tides
line for the entire season.
Guard John Green, Army
Not muchto say except that he
was a little more outstanding than
the other six Army mules.

Tackle Dewitt‘ Coulter, Army

It is very difficult to distinguish
between great and brilliant, but I

«guess that Dewitt isboth of these.

End Dick Duden, Navy

-One of _the most outstanding
men on the Navy tea-m leading the
Navy to their runner up spot in
the football world.

OWin ’em All Season Stopped  

 

By Ohio State; Bethany Is
Next Pitt Panther Opponent

Unless Bethany College abandons its good—neighbor policy in basketball, Pitt .
hopes shattered by a 47-37 defeat by '_Ohio State . .

December 20.

By George J. P. Kiseda

. its win-’em-all

. ﬁgures to cop its home opener with the Bisons on

John Knight’s'hardwood horde has been anything but frugal in doling out victories to Pitt, having
dropped all four of its encounters with the Panthers. Although the Bisons thrashed California Teachers in
their season opener, ,6-49, they do not appear potent enough to cause any noticeable unrest with Dr. H.

C. Carlson’s cagers. ‘

Range Opens

In Stadium

The riﬂe range, located in the
Pitt Stadium opened for practice

last Monday. The range, which-

employs .2-2 cal riﬂes at a range of
ﬁfty feet, will be open every after-
noon Monday through Friday from
1 to 5 o’clock.

The aspirants for -positions on
the team have been practicing for
the last few Weeks at “dry. shoot-
ing.” ‘This involves practice at
aiming and trigger squeeze, with-
out the use of live ammunition.
The “dry” range, located on the
thirteenth ﬂoor of. the Cathedral,
will remain open until Clhristmas
vacation. I

In connection with the riﬂe
teams, M/IS-gt. James Doherty,
manager of the Riﬂes, reveals that
41 colleges and universities have

already accepted challenges for
matches with -the Pitt ROTC team.
In addition, 23 schools have been
scheduled as opponents for the
‘varsity team.

9 For Knight, serving his sixteenth¢

season as Bethany’s pilot, has nary
a man back from the 1944-5 squad
which built up an 8-5 chart‘ of
wins" and losses and averaged 56.2
points per game.

An exponent of goal-getting
basketball, Knight has apparently
used the same mold for this year’s
outﬁt. In the California clash,
four Bisons went above the dou-
ble-ﬁgure standard. Don Harris,
5-10, a forward on the all-frosh
starting lineup, netted 16, while
John Vujnovic, 5-10 guard, bagged
15.
Other starters are Eric Antila,
5-9, a forward, Andy Shedkiac,
6-1, center, and Carl Grizzell, 5-9,
a guard. Tallest man on the team
is Bill Corba, 6-2 pivot. Doc
Whorley, 5-11, who was manager
last year, is the only non-fresh-
man.

Dr. Carlson appears to have
whipped up a capable point-pro-
ducer of his own in co-captain
Hank Zeller, who ﬁred a 19-point
salvo in the opener against Ohio
State at Columbus last Saturday.

PiKA’s New IF

Champions

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
made it deﬁnite that they are the
new IF football champions by
downing the SAE’s on a. forfeit
last week. The new champions
succeed the Phi Ep’s, who were
heavily hit by the draft and grad-
uation last spring. Sparked by
several stars from last year, the

game schedule with only one tie
chalkedi against them. Two men
which many’ IF followers remem-
ber from last year are Johnnie
Wood and J-ohnnie Gallagher.
These two along with Jack Maxim
completed a ‘trio which could run,
pass, block, punt, and snare
passes.

-Cropping second place in the fast
moving league are the Phi Kaps.
Starting from scratch at the be-
ginning of the season, the {Phi
Kaps. molded together an aggrega-
tion which lost but one crucial
game to the PiKA’s.

_____Bep0rting

Sports Editor

The time to plan for the future is the present; therefore, if Pitt is
going to have a winning football team in 1946, the advisory board had

better get to work in 1945.

There is but one way to have a winning

combination——that is to go out and offer the boys something and in

so doing still abide by the Western Conference rules.

The citizens of

Tulsa, Oklahoma, are pledging sums of money to build a dormitory

for Tu1sa‘University’s athletes.

Why?

Well, according to an inﬂu-

ential Tulsa business man,
school has done a tremendous job
for the city. Its football team has
put Tglsa on the map.

Pittsburgh cansay the same of
Pitt but I can’t see why Pitt would
need such -a campaign for a dor-
mitory when we have the old
Shady Side Academy which makes
a more than satisfactory living
quarters. Shady Side was used this
summer as a dorm and meals were
provided for the gridders through
the kitchen. I am positive that the
majority of Pitt athletes would be
willing to live at ‘Shady Side
throughout the year, eat their
meals there, and pay a reasonable
fee. The government has do1lar-a-
year men—why couldn’t the ath-
letic department charge the ath-
letes one dollar a year? In this
way, they are paying for room
and board , and the Conference
can’t say we are breaking their
set of rules.

Now that the boys have room
and ‘board, they will need a job
to provide them with spending
money——to pay for room and

unuwlll

   

 

th :9

board — buy clothes — recreation,
etc. Forty -dollars a month should

be enough; that comes to $10.00 a
week. There are many odd jobs
for them to do around the school
dorm and stadium. Then to round
off this proposed plan, the boys
should be given a scholarship.
Bowl Games

To have a Bowl team it takes a
coach and also darn good material.
These Bowl bound tea-ms nor any
other consistent winner get their
material -by accident. Scan their
rosters and one ﬁnds cities and
st-ates located in all parts of the
U.S.A. How do those boys get
there? It takes an attractive offer
and also a little talking to by their
high school coach. Pitt has had a
loser——but don’t put the entire
blame on the policy of the Uni-
versity, put some on several of
our district high school coaches
who are recommending Southern
schools to their ‘boys in return for
a $50.00 ‘bill. Not bad at all in
fact it’s an easy way to make
some Christmas money.

On Stadium Turf; Students
Are Urged to Come Out

By Wayne Greenberg

Twenty odd hopefuls began practice yesterday at Pitt stadium for the coming track season. Coach
Olson will spend the next few weeks in drilling his boys on the fundamentals of high—toeing along the

Cinders and getting them into good

physical shape.

Ten prospective thin-clads showed up at the organization meeting held last Thursday in Trees Gym,

and, if track meets are won by en-9

thusiasm, then Pitt will have an
outstanding track team this sea-
son. Coach Olson emphasized to
his hopefuls that the facilities at
their disposal would be very lim-
ited and that they might have to
rely on their own ingenuity to get
into shape. This, however, did not
dim the interest of the skeleton
squad.

Of the boys that did come out,
practically all have previous track
experience, and, furthermore, they
represent the crude elements of a
well balanced running outﬁt. Al-
most all of the events that are
usually considered a part of a reg-
ular track meet can be covered by
the present squad.

One of the few lettermen on the
squad is Ed Burns, who hails from
Emerson High in Gary, Indiana.
Ed came to Pitt because his high
school coach, Harold Conley, asked
him to——the reason-—Conley was
an Olson product himself and
wanted Burns to run for the old
Alma Mater. Ed ran for Pitt in
1942 and has also run for MIT.
He participated in the 100 and 220

state meet in 1940, Herb grabbed
off everything he could lay his
hands on, copping ﬁrsts in the 100

broad jump. Other possible stars

NEW
TELEPHONE

EQUIPMENT

 

INCE the war ended, thousands upon thousands of new
telephones have been produced and installed.

Hundreds of miles of telephone cable have rolled outof
Western Electric plants to provide more circuits for you.

Central oflice switchboards and other equipment are being
manufactured with all possible speed.

Much of this equipment is extremely complex—not only
to make but also to ﬁt into the Bell System network. Naturally
shortages caused by four years of war cannot be made up

for overnight.

Supplying materials and equipment for the Bell.System’s
$2,000,000,000 construction program promises record peace-
time volume and a level of employment at Western Electric
higher than in the years immediately preceding the war.

Buy all the Victory Bonds you can—and keep them!
