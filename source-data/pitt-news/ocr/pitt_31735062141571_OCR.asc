Ohio State Game ‘

Fraternities. Cooperate

At a meeting ‘of the a-lumni council
meld last -evening in theoffice of Dr.
Harold I." Miller, president of the
{University alumni association, plans
‘were completed for the Ohio State-
‘Pitt homecoming week-end, next
week.

Ohio State's 120-piece band will ar-
zrive in the city Friday morning to
:give several concerts on the ‘campus
that morning and afternoon and to
-“parade in the downtown streets prep-
atory to the alumni. smoker and home-
.comin_g .d-ancejthat evening.’ In the
__parade the famous red and gray
cloaked band will be joined by-the
ROTC band representing Pitt.

.'l‘l1e two bands will stage another

r gpreparatory parade on the campus J'11S.t

before the game Saturday -afternoons‘
Ten of the nineteen -‘fraternities
,i-ntentions of

ing-.< Ohio State members of those
«chapters will be guests at the Pi-tt
houses over the week-end. Theodore
Biddle, assistant'to the dean of men,
stated yesterday that other fraterni-
ties :will. probably follow this. plan,
but ‘because of rushing season now in
prog-r.ess- all of the fraternities have
not as yet beencontacted. ‘

All of the houses on the campus

.'Wlll be decorated in keeping with the

.homecoming plans.

The ‘homecoming dance and the
alumni smoker, both in the Hotel
.Schenley, will head the welcoming

events Friday evening.

Although no word has as yet been
received by Chancellor John G. Bow--
man, concerning the invitation sent
Governor’ Pinchot of Pennsylvania,
and Governor White of Ohio, it is ex-
pected that they wil__l attend the game
Saturday afternoon.

VV, Don Harrison, director of ath-
‘letics at the University and a-member

of the alumni committee arranging
the week-end events, said yesterday,
“The Ohio State game from every

'standpoint will be the best game of

our season. When Ohio State was in
Pittsburgh in 1929 we did everything

P we could to make their stay a pleas-

ant one. In that we succeeded more
than we had expected. This year,
with that success of three years ago
behind us, we are doing our best to
‘make the Ohio State "welcome a real
one.” ‘ ‘ . C

One of the largest crowd of the
year will attend the Ohio State-‘Pitt
football game next Saturday. Tick-
et -sales thus far exceeded, expecta-
tions, and with the game more than
a week away,‘ it is expected that more
than 60,000 fans will jam the Stadium
gates to-see the third meeting of the
§)eams ‘representing Ohio State and

- Open Bidding

Biddle Anticipates 550, Bids.
and 1'50 Acceptances ,'
During Next Week

To Submit Bids Monday‘

 

Ahectic round of dances, dinners,

luncheons, bowling parties, smokers
and various other social events will
come tofan end Sunday morning at 2
oiclockiwhen the rushing period for
men's-' fraternities closes
silence or bidding period opens.
‘ The silence period, during which no
member of a fra'ternity may approach
or talk to a newly registered student,
will last until 5 o'clock next’Friday
afternoon, but fraternities must sub-
mit their bids to the Dean of Men’s
ofﬁce before 9:30 o'clock Monday
morning.

During the bidding period Mr. Bid-
dle, assistant to the dean of men,
will issue the bids to the freshmen
and those who receive bids will make
known their choices. Freshmen who
receive notice from the Dean of Men’s
ofﬁce that fraternities haveturned in
bids for them must see Mr. Biddle,
whether they expect to accept the
fraternities’ bids or not.

‘Immediately after thebidding period
Mr. Biddle will inform the fraternities
as to the acceptances and declinations
of their bids. '

The rushing season was not only a
very hectic one, but also a. very suc-
cessful one, according to Mr. Biddle.
The lifting of the former limit on the
number ‘of events worked out very
well and --the results’ were much ~more

‘pleasing than those from _the old sys-

tem.

Mr. Biddle also expects a very high
total of bids handed in and a very
high average of acceptances, forecast-
ing a total of 550 bids to 350' rushees
and 150 acceptances next week.

The average number of rushees for
each fraternity who will accept bids
should be higher than in any previous
years, although the number for all
the fraternities, will’ be somewhat
lower, since only 17 ‘fraternities par-
ticipated this year, in contrast with
23 in other years, Mr. Biddle stated.

NMen’s Debating Association will be-
gin next Tuesday, John P. Bracken,
manager, announced ‘last Tuesday
night at a smoker given by the asso-
ciation in the Y.‘M. C. A. hut.

These tryouts will be held in room
217, Alumni Hall, from 12:30’ to 2:30
on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
of next week, during regular-meetings
of the squad. Candidates will present
a five-minute talk on some phase of
the question of increased government

public owners-hip.“All men’ who are
accepted by the coaches will become
members ‘of the association. _
Tentative plans for afreshman de-
bating squad were also announced by
Bracken. “It is hoped,” the manager
said, “that, by the organization of
this group, all frenshman debaters will
have plenty of opportunity to take
part in actual -contests without having
to compete against experienced mem-
bers of the association.” , _
According to this.-sche_me, freshman

teams would debate against each
other before local audiences-, or
against high school teams in the
‘vicinity. "‘

~Twenty\—six prospective candidates,
in addition -to regular members of
last year, attended the smoker. As
chairman .of the meeting, Bracken wel-
comed the newcomers and outlined
brieﬂy the activities of the associa-
tion last season. -

“A schedule of 70 debates, includ-
ing 55 intercollegiate contests-,’~’ the
manager said», “made the University
of Pittsburgh organization the second
most active debating association in
the country during 1931-32.” ,

.Bracken then introduced Prof. W.
M. Parrish, coach of the squad, who
discussed the association and the
various debating teams and named
the qualiﬁcations of a good deba.ter.
Richard Murphy, assistant coach,
spoke next and displayed to the group
an interesting method with which to
test their qualiﬁcations for debating.

If Pitt students are true prophets of
the coming presidential election, Gov-
ernor Roosevelt will shortly be pack-
ing his baggage and forsaking Albany
for Washington. _

In the October issue of the Pitt

us this morning, the.-results of the
Pitt Panther presidential poll, the
largest student ballot ever cast on

given an overwhelming majority.
Of the 2,912 votes cast, the Demo-

cent.

Hoover was second-with 31.37 per
cent; Thomas third, with 16.71 per
cent; and Foster fourth, with 3.30 per
cent.

Other candidates who received
votes were: Upshaw, Reynolds, Coxey
and Father Cox. In addition; nine
votes were cast for Edna Wallace

to tackle their second opponent of the
season, the Carnegie Tech Plebes.

The -game will be played at the
Stadium as a- preliminary to the ’I‘ech-
Vvash-Jeff contest, and as usual, the
result is in doubt. Little can be pre-
dicted for freshman teams, but Coach
Gougler expects the little Panthers to
put in a. tough afternoon.

No certain lineup has been an-
nounced for the Pitt frosh, and be-
cause the fresh have. been shifted
around so much in the workouts, it
is extremely dillicult to_even name
the starters. However, certain fresh-
men have stood out well in most of
the workouts and can "look forward
with conﬁdence to grabbing a start-
ing berth. ’

The tentative lineup is as follows:
Roberts, center; Detzel, Franks, Wol-
gomouth, or McCue, guards; Hall,
Failor, Buskart or Stoughton at the
tacklesp Baxter, Sites, or Bratton,
ends; Green or Vaughn, quarterback;
Randor, Glassford, or Roictor at full-
back; and Malarkey, Wood, or LaRu.e
at the halfback posts.

In case of rainy weather, the game
will not be played.

Varsity, lzreséhmen Show Good
Form in Early Workouts

Although the first meet of the sea-
son is not scheduled until the begin-

 

-ning of the year, and but two weeks

of practice have been completed, the
freshman and ‘varsity swimming can-
didates are in -excellent shape.

One of the strongest, if not the very
strongest, schedules ever arranged for
a Pitt swimming team faces Coach
Pat Corr and his splashers. Yale and
Harvard head the list, and with the
reputation of years of undefeated
teams behind them, are more than
likely to test the Panthers to the
limit, _ _

Ride!‘ CO11€ge, F. & M., Delaware,
Carnegie Tet.-.h, and Western Reserve
round out the schedule, and by no
stretch of the imagination can any of
them be classed as “pushovers.”

~Always strong in the relays in past
years,‘ the results of the past weeks’
workouts seem to point to another
strong team. In a time trial held this
week over the .160 yard course, the
varsity relayers turned in the excel-
lent time of -one minute, fourteen and
four-tenths seconds. ”
relay team ﬁnished a second behind‘.

Breast stroke material is again
plentiful with Joe Schmieler and Irv
Robbins leading the pack by good
lnargllls. V John Carik, diver and
backstroke artist seems headed for
the same high point total he compiled
last season. In the «dashes, Coach
Corr has Captain Adlersberg, =Stinner,
Denny, and Davies, among others, at
his disposal. ' '

Freshman material is much better
than 1n past seasons, and the Fresh.
man team s loss of Szawzuk and Jones

in mid-year will be the varsity’.s- gain..

Both boys are exceptionally fast back
strokers, and could well be-used on
the Panthers eastern tour.

Fr-o_.sh freestyle material seems to
be as‘plentiful as ants at a picnic, but
as in everything, there are some
standouts, namely Chuck Chambers,
former P. A. A. star, Joe Madden,
sensational Schenley High lad; and
Russ Lindberg, of the Homestead Li-

After defeating Westminster over
the Schenley Park course last Satur-

high hopes of adding West Point to,

their string of victims.

The race will likely be run tomor-

handicap of ‘racing over unfamiliar

quiet, resigned cadets whose colors
had been so ignominiously lowered
that afternoon on the Stadium ﬁeld.

I Not so many hours -ago thirty-ﬁve

lmulti-fashioned warriors departed
from the city; traveling eastward to
plant their colors of blue and gold on
the ﬁeld of Michie Stadium tomorrow
afternoon. The result will be history
in not so many hours——history in the
making that is being eagerly watched
throughout the country. _

Just in the way of introduction.
these words above are a preface of a
football game to be played tomorrow
afternoon at West Point.
‘ That game will bring together Dr.
Sutl1erland’s Golden Panthers and
Major Ralph <Sasse’s West Point
kaydets, in their second meeting on
the gridiron battleﬁeld in that many
years.
I This game is being watched with
such observant interest because the
winner of tomorrow’s game is the
most likely team to win" the mythical
eastern football championship-.

Pitt Has Edge V

Pitt, up to this afternoon, has a
slight edge over West Point. In three
games the Panthers have rolled up the
impressive total of 120 points to their
opponents nothing, triumphing over
Ohio Northern, W'est Virginia, and Du-
quesne in equally ea.sy_fashion. The
cadets have played but ‘two games,
usinga rather legarthic football man-
ner against Furman, and obliging
some visiting congressmen in defeat-
ing little . Carlton 57 to nothing.
Neither game has given the Army
much chance to prove its mettle, while
Pitt has shown not only its enor-
mous strength but its abnormal power
in reserves. I

There is very little doubt in the
minds of most of those who seem to
know their football that Pitt will win
tomorro_yv’s game, but upon analysis
they are not quite so certain. Army
.was supposed to‘ be coming to Pitts-
burgh with the game practically won,
--but the Panthers sent the cadets back
to West Point nursing a. 26-0 defeat——
a stinging as well * as surprising de-
feat, entirely unexpected.

Campus elections,

characterized in the past by charges and

.co‘unter-charges of -factional intimidation of votingstudents, ballot

‘Pitt students every reason to feel thoroughly disgusted with “things

years—forgetting what may have-occurred before——without a cry of
“Fraud!” from the rightfully indignant loser and a knowing chuckle

from the apathetic onlooker.

The task of successfully conducting an election against such a

background is not an easy one. TT_he position of elections "chairman,

Track and Field Games

C the program planned by Coach Carl. Olsen for Pitt’s ﬁrst annual fall
track and ﬁeld games, to be held in the Stadium and on~the football practice

I ‘ﬁeld next. Wednesday a1Id Friday afternoons.

The mediocre high school athlete who came to the University and for-
sook sports for study, and the average University man who “would like to

run” but feels certain he would have

no chance in varsity competition, are

_ going‘ to have their day. Pitt’s average athlete-—not the well-drilled, care-

fully-groomed “squad man” who has been in the public eye ever since his
prep school days———is coming down from the Stadium stands to have a try

at the game himself.

Too little provision has been made in the‘ past for this average athlete.
He seems to have been overlooked in a rather thoughtless manner, because,
. after all, he is one of the most important fellows in the University.
He is a well-balanced,.sensible individual, whose interests are so, varied
as to assure him of the advantages of the extremes in his undergraduate life.

Scholarship“ and recreation through athletics both hold his interest.

Neither

as such, is deserving of its consideration for his welfare.

joining in theeffort to make theforthcoming track and ﬁeld games a suc-.

cessful and permanent feature of the athletic program at the University, ‘

have earned the commendation of every one who has "an interest in the pro-

‘motion of a more extensive intramural program. '

i“.Housemothers Just Like  
Real Mothers’ ’ ----F rat_ Men

By Charles Foreman
With our own mothers signifying,
sometimes, strict obedience and. Se-
vere discipline, the idea of a_ frater-
nity housemother might appear to
men living away from home to be a
damper on fraternity freedom, has
not proven so on the University
campus. 4
An indication that Pitt fraternities
have come “to a realization of the
worthwhileness of housemothers lies
in the fact that four -of the local
groups have, in the last four years,
of their own accord, secured such
women for themselves. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon was the ﬁrst University fra-
ternityto try the plan. _____
Mrs. A. M. Veith, who came in the
fall of 1928, had beeen a housemother
for three years at the -S. A. E. house
of Allegheny College at Meadville.
She is a past mistress; in the art of
handling men, andtwhen asked what
she ‘thought of sororities she said,
“I wouldn’t mother a house of girls
for worlds. Oh. t.hey’re alright, but
the boys are better.” S. A. E. agrees.
Phi Kappa and Phi Gamma Delta
were so convinced of the beneﬁts of
h-ousemothers that they persuaded
Mrs. McAlwee and Mrs. Bonesteele to
assume such duties at their respective
houses at the beginning of last year.
Mrs. McAlwee who knows only too
well how -trying men can be some-
times, says that she has no slightest
complaint to offer concerning the Phi
Kappas, she likes her boy-s as much,
if not more, than they like her. “They
are such good pals to each other, re-
spectful and courteous to me, and
careful of the house in which they
live.” .
Mrs,.Bonesteel, of the Phi Delts
laughingly talked of the amorous side

"of her work, of. the boy’s concern
‘over their. cooling loves.

“They ask
me all kinds of questions concerning
their love affairs and I have tried al-
ways to advise them as a mother

Omega Delta Joins.
The latest convert to this increas-

ingly successful cause is _Omega Delta
. which has-entered the fold this year

 

-by their acquisition ‘of the services of
Mrs. M. A. Davidson as housemother.
Mrs. Davidson is the operator of; a
resort hotel .at Lake Chatauqua dur-
ing the summer months and has
-served as housemother on the campus
of Ohio University for a period of two
years. .

The University is wholeheartedly in
favor of . the housemother plan and
hopes that in the next few ygars every
fraternity will have a competent
woman in charge of its house. To
quote Mr. Theodore W. Biddle, assist-
ant to the dean of men: “The Uni-
versity is convinced that housemoth-
ers, when carefully selected, help’ to
provide the ﬁnest moral and soci_a1
atmosphere ‘in . fraternity houses.
Also, experience has proven ' that
housemothers more than pay their
way in effecting economies in kitchen
and household management.

“It is my hope that in the near fu-
ture all fraternities on the University
campus will be suﬂiciently convinced
of the worthwhileness of housemoth-
ers that of their own volition they
will follow the example set by these
four fraternities.” _

- THE .Prr-rm-:ws

 Dr. BeniG.iWi11iams.Studies League of Nations. Six

Weeks; Obtains First Hand Knowledge of Secretariat"

. By Irving D. Robbins .
“Sympathy at Geneva is almost unanimously with China_ in the

A Manchurian controversy,” declared Dr. Ben Gr. XVilliams, professor

of political science, who returned Monday to the United States after
a seven weeks’ stay in Geneva, Switzerland. '
- “At present there is a continual conﬂict on the Lytton Report

between China and_Japan.

An attempt will probably be made‘ by

the League of Nations to put a system of international control in
Manchuria, but the outcome is doubt-9———'

ful because of.the Japanese attitude.
However, if the League proceeds
slowly there is some possibility of
success.”_

Completes Studies
Dr. Williams was in Genevai to
complete ‘studies he has made on the.
relation of the United States to the
League. These studies. are in line

with those he has already made on

American foreign policy and will help
form the material for a. book Dlf.“Wllf
liams is planning to write. i

Dr. Williams paid particular atten-

tion to the work of thesecretariat of
the League, pa.rticularly its. effect on
the United States. He attended. the
meetings of the Preparatory Commis-
sion for the Disarmament Conference
and the Council of the -Leaguestand
also was present at the ﬁrst few ses-
sions ~of_the Assembly. He met lead-
er in all lines of work and gathered
much information about the machin-
ery and fundtions of the League. At
present the greatest problem before
the Assembly is the Lytton. report on

the ‘Manchurian question on which‘

discussion has been
November 14.

The Lytton report was the result
of an investigation by’ a special

postponed until

League of Nations commission, head-A

ed by Lord Lytton, an Englishman,
into the causes and nature of the dis-
pute ofiChina and Japan over Man-
churia and the subsequent invasion
by Japan of Manchuria. The report
censured Japan for the. manner in
which it gained possession of Man-
churia, but also laid blame for the
Chinese difficulties on the lack of in-
ternal control in China. It recom-
mended a strong effort by the Chinese
to gain a strong central government
and stated that aid to thetchinese by
other world powers was necessary.

America is Cooperating

Questioned with regard to American
cooperation, with the League Dr. Wil-
liams said that on questions such as
opium, slavery in Liberia, disarma-
ment, the United States is working
closely‘ and officially with the League.
In other matters, such as the ﬁnancial
‘work of the League which includes
building up the credit structure of
weakﬁnancial spots such as Austria
and Greece, there is cooperation by
individual Americans. ‘

Although the United States is co-
operating in disarmament moves, no
hope is held out for an important
move in_ the near future. Germany’s
action in stating that she considers
herself no longer bound by the arma-
ment clauses of the Versailles treaty
has brought about some new activity
with regard to disarmament. Dr.
Williams pointed out that the dis-
armament movement progresses by
ﬁts and starts, making progress or
failing to do so according to the
psychological situation. There is a
feeling ‘in Geneva that some progress
is about to be made. .

While in Geneva, Dr. Williams
stayed at a pension where representa-
tives of twelve different nationalities
also lived. ‘Most of these people‘ were
students or league ' empl-oyes. Dr.
Williams found the ‘spirit of the
League is democratic rather than bu-
reaucratic. . '
