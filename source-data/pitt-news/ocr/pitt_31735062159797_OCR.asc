“If any Blue Devils show up we’ll give them a helluva

hot welcome!”

tomorrow with a win from Duke.

Guest speaker for the program
will be Ed Beachler, feature writer
and ex-sports writer from the
Pittsburgh Press. Beachler is a Pitt

ﬁeld coach Edgar “Special,Deliv-
ery” Jones, Professor R. X. Gra-

the student body.

Also on deck will be the cheer-
leaders, the Panther, and the Pitt

Efforts are being made to get
many members of the faculty and
administration over to the pep
rally, SC president Cyril Wecht
stated. He added:

* * * Duke Backﬁeld Threat,’ * *
Dukes Field Speedy Backfield
Against Light Panther Quartet

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Pitt stands a good chance of winning its grid opener
tomorrow afternoon when the Panthers meet the Duke Blue

Devils at the Stadium.

An estimated crowd of 30,000 fans will be on ‘hand for

the clash which begins at 2:00 p.m. WDTV and KDKA will
bring the gameto armchair fans at 1:45. Woody Wolfe. will
handle the radio broadcast and Mel Allen, the TV affair.

Not since 1939-the year Charlie:

Bowser’s charges edged Duke,
14-13, at the Stadium——has a Pitt
team defeated the Southerners.
Dukes Two Up

Of the eight games played to
date, Duke has won ﬁve. Pitt has
claimed three’. This year may be
different, however, despite the
fact that local oddsmakers have
installed Pitt as a seven-point un-
derdog.

Pitt’s offensive backfleld— its
most potent weapon—will again

be guided by Bob Bestwick, sen-

ior from Shaler Township. Al-
though a T-quarterback for only
one season, Bestwick surprised
football fans last year by out-
pitching Notre Dame’s Bob Wil-
liams.

His favorite targets this year are
Ends Chris Warriner, Pitt’s All-
American hope, and Dick Deitrich,
sophomore up from the frosh team‘.

Running with Bestwick are three
hard-driving backs: Bill Reynolds,
at lefthalf, Lou Cimarolli at
righthalffand Bob Epps at full-
back. Cimarolli and Epps are
sophomores. ‘ ‘

These three were partly respon-
sible for the Duke’s explosive vic-
tory over South Carolina last
week, 34-6.

Devils Have Weight

Duke’s line averages 202 while 
Pitt’s'forward wall scales 204. In‘ ,
‘the backﬁeld the Blue Devils also 

have the edge, 182 to 178.

_An odyssey that began on
~—Tap Day, 1951 has not yet
ended for Nancy Tear, nation-
ality room. hostess awardee,
though she has returned to
class, student teaching, and. a
busy activities schedule.

Winning the award was the
ﬁrst “step of a journey that
took Nancy to England, Scot-
land, France, Austria, Switz-
erland, Liechtenstein a nd
Italy. ,,

Shipboard on June 11

After a confused jumble of im-
munity shots, picture taking, pass-
port arrangements, and "the con-
cluding of the spring semester,
Nancy left June 11 from New
York on the student ship, “Anna
Salen.”

Of"-this voyage, sponsored by
the ‘ouncil on Student Travel,
Nancy exclaims, ‘‘I_ wouldn’t have
traded that ship for 10 passages on
the Queen Mary!” - , '

The stay, in England lasted sev-
eral weeks, and" included a trip
to the northern ‘lake district to
"visit relatives, study at the. Uni-‘
versity of London, and more study
at the University of Sheffield.

, Course on Britain

While in London, Nancy with
the student group was given a
special course on “Misunder—
standing Britain.”

This included a study of sys-
tems of government and foreign
policy. Outstanding here were
memorable handshakes with An-
thony Eden and Aneurin Bevan.

At Sheﬂield, the group learned
of the British economic system in
more ‘detail while living with
British families in their homes.
“They stressed the socialistic

" viewpoint, and also gave us the

‘ opportunity for individual re-
search on it, too.”
. Next Stop, Paris

The next stop was Paris, where
the students lived at the Cite Uni-
versitaire—'-the quarters for all

' students in Paris. Here, ‘visits to
industrial and cultural centers
gave them an idea of the place of
France‘ in relation to a United

, Europe. T . ‘

The week in Geneva, Switzer-
land, Nancy considers the high
point of the trip, Here the group
attended, alts of the sessions of the
United Nations Economic and So-

cial‘ C0l.lIlCl1, and were addressed '

by the principle delegates.
From here Nancy was on her

Wish I Was single   

Coming back to school after summer vacation
is like coming home to a witoh of a wife.

It’s like one of my old high school buddies was
telling me one day last November. He worked on
a construction. gang for a year before he started/
to college, and even those frustrating class con-
ﬂicts at registration time didn’t dim hishopes that
this college life was going to be i
a lot‘ easier than swinging a pick
and shovel. ’ — h

"‘I changed my mind in a
hurry,” he told me. “When I
worked digging ditch, I worked

home I was‘ done for the day
My nights were my own.”
“Now I put in so much time

 

can’t even squeeze in basketball. practice t1ce a

* week! And’ as for dates—it’s almost hopeless!”

The‘"ldle College Boy" —

Of course, that lay-off betweenhigh school and
college made him more impressed than the ordi-
nary frosh with the amount of _work involved in
being an “idle” college boy. But I’d bet a lot of
students reluctant to make the plunge back into
school routine, have that same feeling right now.

This ﬁrst week of school I feel like a reluctant
bridegroom, 'married -again for the fourth time to
this dame Routine and all her in-laws, the, text-
books. ‘ ‘-

Why School? . 9‘ -

Why do we come back? Jobs are plentiful. If
you aren’t absolutely lazy, you can get a steady
job that will give you‘ cash enough to pay for your:
needs and most of "your wants. '

Or you can, as four of us did, try apay-as-you-

Edu:cation—",Bah" 

A word fast becoming one of" blasphemy and
vitriol; in my vocabulary is a harmless combina-
tion of letters, sounds, and innulendomes that reads
educate. ;

The letters by themselves are ﬁne; and put to-
gether they fuse into a‘ well-balanced word that is
quite nice-to«..l_ook at. There is an “e” at both ends
and in " the second: space from
both ends" there is a letter that
rises above the others to give
the ﬁnished product the look of
a spired piece of gothic archi-
tecture.

The soun-d is innocuous
enough. Say’ the _word to your-
self. Nothing wrong, is there?

But it’s the -innuendoes that - ._ ................... _. vs‘
hurt. The word used to mean an honest attempt

to inform, a disinterestedpropagation of learning.

     

‘People ‘who wantyou to see things their way have

usurped the word for their own petty purposes. Af-
ter living next door to the Nazis and more recently
the Russians, they found "they had to’ discard that
naughty old word, “propaganda.” They found that
it just wasn’t appreciated on this side of the At-

\ My trip, your trip, any trip makes you realize
there are unimaginable thousands of ways to pro-
vide yourself with 1ife’s essentials: food, drink,
sleep and recreation. And whether you prefer
white collars_ or overalls, adventure or security,
there’s no rule saying you must have a diploma to
start. '

So why-.do we come back to this routine of lec-

tures, textbooks and stuffy Tuck Shops‘?
Degree Valuable

Reason one: For men, there's that thing our‘

fathers and uncles didn’t have to worry about-. the
draft, which most want to postpone. ’

Reason two: .Best stated by the dean of_the Col-
. lege, Stanton C. Crawford, who once said something-

like this: “No, I don’t think a collegedegree is get-
ting ‘cheaper’ or less valuable because more people
have them.”

“It’s like automobiles—there are many more
car-owners today than there were in l915, but
automobiles are not less valuable because they are
no longer rare. In fact they are more expensive,
more complicated, and more nearly a necessity.”

Reason three: A“ double-barreled one—-the ex-
tras of college life, things like friends and football,
mean lot of fun when you’re in, and the training
can mean a chance for a bigger salary whenpyou
get out. Is the Vagabond. urge to follow a new road
so different from the student’s fascination with the
twists and turns in the “paths of knowledge?”

Can Enioy More

Admittedly the real student, the one who re-u A

gardls his diploma as a‘ ticket, not a’ receipt, should

‘have more money, morewisdom, and at least as

much enjoyment out -of life as our Vagabond.

Whythe Outburst? V '
Now, what brought on this outburst?
Strangely enough it was Student Congress. At
its informal‘meeting held last -Friday the gang got
around to. discussing the" forthcoming Pitt Chest

_-results of’ past. Chest drives and how they have
trnissed their goals. One 'manV,,I forget who it was,

worried out loud that past drives have even,lef't

money lying "around loose that should have beeni

Whereupon Congressman Larry ‘Adler popped

‘\'_1.1p with the statement—an'd at last Vwe getto the

point of all this—that “we. must educate the ‘stu-

dent ﬁrst.” And reading over my-rnotes on“ that -V

meeting I see that I have marked down after
this terse little comment, “BAH!”

"Poor Ignorant Stuclents"' ’

“Educate the student ﬁrst”——-the very‘ words
show a certain_ smugness. Pity the poor ignorant
students. They just don’t appreciate those big,
bold rascals that ‘take their money for the. Chest.
Also,‘ someone has to tell them how much .more

  Panthers ToFace Coach
Bill Murray’s S Split-T

By JULES FELDMAN ' -

A fast, spirited, and somewhat green Duke Blue Devil
squad invades the Stadium tomorrow for the ninth renewal
of a series dating back to 1929. The visitors will be battling
to extend their four game victory skein now held over the
Panthers. The Panthers last victory was recorded in 1939.

Pitt followers have not forgotten the 28-14 licking suf-
fered at the hands of Billy Cox, Glen Wild, and Company

in last season’s opener. Some con—'

 

   
   

Begin Drills

For Opener

Frosh-JV coach, Ernie Hef-
ferle, has started prepping
for the Navy tilt on Oct. 13
with extensive -drills at Ells-

iworth ﬁeld. From these early
" ‘drills Hefferle is beginning to

form a starting lineup for the

four game schedule.
RudA'y’vMattioli, cousin of former

Pitt lineman Fran Mattioli, seems

to have the inside track on the all-

important position of quarterback

“for the combined Frosh-JV, team.

Mattioli, who earned All-State
recognition at Har-Brack last year,
attended summer sessions at Ken-

‘ tucky before switching to Pitt, thus

making him ineligible for varsity
‘competition for one year.
_ Heavy Line

,Running_ with Mattioli in the
ﬁrst string backﬁeld are John
Jacobs. from Georges Township,
Lee Bero of Uniontown and Bill
“Hoffman, a hard driving fullback
from Greensburg. .

At center Don Schlick, six foot
200-pound All—Ohio Valley selec-

solation may be felt, however, in
the fact that All-American Cox is
now toting for the pro Washington
Redskins.

Several other key positions were
vacated by graduation. This only
heightened the difficulty that
Coach Bill g, .:
M u r r a y, who
coached at Del-
aware U. last
year, found in
molding his 20
remaining let-
' t e r In e n into.
his split-T'for-
mation. That he‘
h a s succeeded
was proved last
w e e k ' in the
Blue Devil’s 34-
6.conquest of South Carolina.

Featuring the passing of Pitts-
burgh’s Glen Wild and the running
of righthalf Piney Field, reputed
to be the fastest back in the coun-
try, the visitors are expected to
exhibit a swift, smooth offense.
Freshman sensation Jerry Barger,
who sparkled in the South Caro-
lina game, will share the quarter-
back duties with Wild.

Experienced Ends

  

Wild

Coach Murray’s main concern is
centered in his line. Duke’s_ for-
ward wall, averaging 202 pounds,
will be one of the lightest in the
school’s past ﬁve years.

eleven will show “iron man”

Birds and Bees Set to .Music;kCoed

 

By ELINORE STONE

Everyone is interested in
the‘ birds and the bees.

Twenty year old co-ed,"
Beatrice Paul, has capitalized
on that interest with her 40th
original song, A Bird and a Bee. <

e“It all began one morning last
February,” says Miss" Paul, a jun-
'ior in the College, “while I was
brushing my teeth. I began think-
ing of-the birds and bees in gen-

hing a tune and simultaneously
talking words to it.”

. "Bea then went to the agent of
Baron Elliott, local band leader
withthe words and tune. He liked

Increase in

Awaited by

Salary Still
Faculty

That tentative faculty salary increase of last year is still
tentative. As yet the promised 10% wage increase has not
A I

materialized. V

Last year the faculty objected
that their salaries did not allow
them a living wage and many of
them would be forced to leave
their positions for work in indus-
try and other more remunerative
ﬁelds, unless they received an in-
crease.

At present the situation is still
the same, but according to a fac-

Aulty representative, a future in-

crease is now more probable.

He stated that the increase de-
pend: on the Tax Bill now before
the Pennsylvania House of Rep-
resentatives. When it is passed the
resulting appropriation bill will
allow educational institutions an
additional amount for their budg-
ets. If the appropriation meets the
necessary amount, the faculty will
receive their increase.

If that should happen the situa-
tion will be relieved.

THE PITT NEWS staff will
meet at 7 p.m. tonight in the

while attempting to take a photo
of commuters coming into the sta-
tion. a -

Stokes had stationed himself on
top of a line of lockers, boxes, and,
as he prepared to shoot the pic-
ture, the two men called him down
and asked him for his authority to
take pictures on PRR property.

He had none.

After a few hurried calls to Pitt
he was cleared but he missed his
9:30 class.
