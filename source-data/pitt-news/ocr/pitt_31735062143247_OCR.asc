Registration applications from all entering

and summer freshmen, and upperclass transfers of the University of

Pitt Adds Courses

In Area, Language

Four new courses are included

in the Area and Language pro-
gram at the University. They are
Slavonic Europe in the Twentieth
Century, A Survey of Strategic
Materials, Aviation Geography,
and the History of Air Power.

This brings to 15 the number
of courses in foreign relations
added since Pearl [Q-larbor. They
range from wartime leadership in
American history to Russian art
and from the geography of S-outh
America to social life and prob-
lems of the Far East.

Pitt is well to the fore in offer-
ing studies in international rela-
.tions. As evidence, the University
brought Dr. Chiu Chun f'rom
Chungking, China, to teach
Chinese culture and the language.
To bring him to Pittsburgh ar-
rangements were made through
the State Department with the
Chinese National Government.

He is one of a number who have
been added to the faculty for the
Area and Language program. Be-
fore the war many courses in
international affairs were offered.
War heightened the interest to
the extent that an entirely new
approach was made. All the teach-
ing of an area, the geography,
history, social and economic life,
and even the language was cor-
related. Five localities were taken
for «detailed -study, the Far East,
Russia, Germany, France, and
Latin America.

Then the recent inﬂuence of air
travel on _ international affairs
further widened horizons. Last
fall the College began a program
wherein students could be grad-
uated with a major in aviation, a
highly unique -development in
education. Four uﬁelds of. special-
ization were permitted, aviation,
aviation geography, physics-mete.-
orology, and mathematics-naviga-
tion. A University wide program
provides for cooperation with the
Schools of Business Administra-
tion, ‘Engineering, and Education
and with the Buhl Planetarium.

International relations have been
stressed at ‘Pitt as in few other
places. Pitt was selected as one
of 17 Inter-American centers for
building good will in the western
hemisphere. Moreover, nowhere
else in the worlddo classrooms
take into consideration the nativi-
ty of the student body as do the
Nationality Classrooms.

Players, and all eager beavers take
notice! Work on the three; t‘hat’s

Freshmen attending the Camp
will be classiﬁed by schools, such
as Pre—Meds, College, Engineers,
and Business - Administration. As
athletics will be a vital part of
the program, a competitive sports
sch-edule between schools has been
organized including the following
activities: touch foot-ball, softball,
Volleyball, badnfinton, t e n n i s,
table tennis an-d riﬂe marksman-
ship. Points will be awarded each
school on the basis of games won
and lost. The school having the
most points will be declared the
-Camp -Champions. The school win-
ning the softball championship
will play the faculty. In addition
to this game, the faculty will be
available for informal recreation.

Robert L. Arthur, Counselor to
Student Activities in the Ofﬁce of
the Dean of Men, and Director of
the University Band and -Orches-
tra, has made the following
statement concerning Freshmen
C.amp: “In previous years much
has been accomplished with the
University Band. The opportunity
was available at camp for fresh-
man band candidates to get a good
start in playing and drilling. Due
to so many uncertainties this year,
regarding the number of freshman
candidates for the band as well
as the instrumentation repre-
sented by them, no attempt will
be made to conduct musical re-
hearsals at -camp. However, every
bit of available time will be de-
voted to drilling and marching in
preparation for «the ban-d’s par-
ticipation in the football season.
All freshman candidates, for the
band," therefore, are urged to at-
tend Freshman Camp.”

This Freshman Camp confer-
ence is_run under the auspices of
the University of Pittsburgh Y.
M. C. A. with the co-operation of
the University, faculty, and all
men’s organizations. Further in-
formation may be obtained at the
Freshman Ca-mp Headquarters in
the Cathedral of Learning or the
Y. M. C. A. during the registra-
tion, September ‘18-20.

Hoffman Participates

In Discussion

iGeor-ge A. Hoffman, assistant to
the ‘dean of men, and counsellor
to veteran’s, participated in a

radio roundtable discussion on the
“Fighters for Peace” program,
Sept. 9. The script was written by
Mrs. Victoria Corey, who instructs
courses at Pitt in radio writing.

The purpose of the program was
to acquaint the public with the
veteran’s activities and problems.
Also taking part in the discussion
were men representing Carnegie
institute of Technology, School of
Robert Morris, and Gulf Research.

Bill Babcock acted as moderator
and Leo Kaye was director.

Wills Prepares
Continuation

Of ROTC

Instruction in the Basic Course
Reserve Oﬁicers Training Corps
(R-OTC) will continue this fall,
according to Major Merlin V.
Wills, professor of Military Sci-
ence and. Tactics.

All ROTC classes this year will
mee-t on Monday, Tuesday and
Friday the fourth hour. “Since
there are no other classes s-ched-
uled for freshman and '1 sopho-
more men during these hours,
there can be no class conﬂicts,”
said Major Wills. A /

Every incoming freshman is re-
quired to pass a physical exam-
ination prior to being enrolled in
the ROTC. Since many freshmen
will not be able to take this phys-
ical examination prior to regis-
tration, they will be permitted to
register for the RO"I‘C', subject to
ﬁnal approval of physical exam-
ination. “Those students,” Major
Wills said, “who do not pass the
physical examination must either
drop ROTC, or if they are partic-
ularly interested in the course,
they‘ may secure permission to
pursue the work under the provi-
sions of paragraph 20, army reg-
ulation 145-1-0. Such students,” he
continued; “are required to pay

Pitt Organizes

New Band

Remember that Pitt Band of
old? A hundred and twenty strong
they marched down the ﬁeld to the
beat .of the four base drums. The
good old days! For two years the
war curtailed any such band en-
deavor. Now that the war is over
that old-time, good-time’ Pitt
Marching Band is once more in
the offing.

In order to be trained musically
and to be properly drilled it is
necessary to organize the band at
the earliest possible moment. Re-
hearsals and drills will begin this
week, with the ﬁrst meeting of
bandsmen scheduled .for today,
Wednesday, September 19, at 4:30
o’clock in room 817 C1. At this
time new and old members will
meet with Mr. Arthur, director of
the University Band and orchestra.

Complete announcement will be
made concerning time and lace of
rehearsals and drills on the bul-
letin board in the ground ﬂoor ele-
vator lobby of the Cathedral. All
interested are asked to watch for
the announcement and carry out
the directions. l

J ones’ Story

“One More Battle,” a story fea-
tured in the August 26th issue of
This Week Magazine, was writ-
ten by Dr. Putnam_F,e,nn'el Jones,
associate professor of English. The
story deals realistically with one
of the problems facing-today’s re-
turning veterans. '  .

Dr. Jones began "i2s7'i‘iting. short
stories about eight ye.-g.r.;, a‘g‘p:,'.Be-
fore that, his writing‘, consisted
mostly of academic tworksjiand

creations have appeared in-_ os-

cations. ‘.:- ‘ :‘,-‘.

According to Dr. Jones, tlgere is
no royal road to success in writ-
ing. At the start, b.e.con'sid'e-‘red
himself fortunate to 3sell on,e,.s't'ory
out of every seven.éiJ:b.n'1itted: It
takes a lot of writing..a.nd frequent
studying of other pepple’s ‘stories
to bring about the Iiec’essary;‘p2ro-
fessional polish in technique and

bring in new ideas and promote plans for a better peacetime

As quietly as he carried out his duties as vice-chancellor in

the past :two years, Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald assumed his new

responsibility as Chancellor July 1 without any inaugural cere-
mony. And we heartily agree with Dr. John G. Bowman, former
Chancellor and new president of the University, that this is
just the man to take his place. We are pleased with his selec-
tion.

Dr. Fitzgerald, so-ft—spoken, quiet and reserved in appear-

ance, always has a warm smile and friendly handshake for stu-
I dents.

It is his belief that young people should not only be
taught to think through today’s complex problems, but take an
active part in solving them. Thus, his sincere interest in the
curriculum and activities of students is well understood.

We congratulate Dr. Fitzgerald and extend to him. our very

' best wishes for success in his new position.

In Veteran Training

The University continues as one
of the country’s largest education
centers for returned war veter-
ans. .More than 800 are expected
to apply for interviews for admis-
sion this fall with the number
steadily increasing.

There are many reasons for
Pitt’s "popularity with discharged
soldiers to prepare them for al-
most every vocation. Moreover,
those who have returned to their
jobs can com-e to school at night.

Some have no money stored
away and would not ‘be able to
study without government aid.
Others might not ﬁnd the sub-
sistance «beneﬁts adequate for liv-
ing ex-penses. However those with
homes in Pittsburgh will not have
this expenditure. In general, city
universities appeal to the return-
ed service men because of their
nearness to some industry or vo-

cational interest.

A number of those who have
applied for admission
have said they want to play foot-
ball. Others have asked about the
ban-d and other musical organ-
izations. .Some want to write for
the Pitt News and Owl, the stu-
dent year book, or to ‘be business
managers for university activities.

The largest number will likely
enter the College because here
they can gain a «background for
many -ﬁeld-s. Other large enroll-
ments will be in business admin-
istration, engineering, medicine,
and dentistry. Over a ﬁfth will
take evening classes.

Panthers Open ’45 Grid Season

Illinois Strikes Out

Against Pitt

By Larry Bondy, Sports Editor
The Pitt Panthers open their
1945 grid season this Saturday af-
Illinois
against Ray Eliot’s ﬁghting’ Illini.
‘This marks th-e opener for both
teams, but Illinois again goes onto

ternoon in Champaign,

the ﬁeld the favorite.

‘Pitt surprised Eliot last year
when they went out an-d took the
lead in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of
play with -a ﬁeld goal; then Illi-
nois came back to run wild and

take the ball game.

Again Coach Shaughnessy ﬁelds
a green team and refuses to com-
ment on the outcome of the open-
er. “The boys are hard workers,
a «dependable bunch and more
than anything else, they have a
lot of spirit,” says Shaughnessy.

Glancing over the squad that
started summer ‘training on July
30, we ﬁnd it much stronger in all
departments as -compared to last

Father Dies

Urie N. Arthur, father of Rob-
ert L. Arthur, assistant dean of
men, died Thursday morning,
September 13, in Shadyside Hos--
pital. Former chief engineer of
the department of city-planning,
Mr. Arthur had been with the
‘bureau of engineering of the city
for many years. He was a graduate
of Allegheny college and a mem-
ber of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity,
the Smithﬁeld Methodist church,
and the American Society of Civil
Engineers.

Funeral services were held at
the Beinhauer Mortuary with in-
terment in Mt. Lebanon cemetery.

 

An Army P-51, ﬂown to the‘-

county airport from Hartford,
Conn., in one -hour and 43 minutes
ﬂying time, and ‘ﬂanked by a po-
lice escort through the busy traf-
ﬁc of Pittsburgh, has at last
grounded on Pitt campus.

Housed in the School of Mines
building, the dismantled Mustang
rests in two parts: the fuselage
and wings, thus permitting better
use and study to be _ma.de on it.
The battle—s-carred fighter plane,
which no longer can be ﬂown, will
be used as a laboraory adjunct
for classes in automotive engi-
neering.

It will also be useful in teach-
ing college classes in physics, par-
ticularly the physics of ﬂight. It
will serve as an object lesson for
student mathematicians‘ studying
conics or curves fundamental in
engineering by conics. In addi-
tion, it will familiarize students
planning ﬂight lessons with the
cockpit, instrument panel, and
controls.

Music Award

Theodore M. Finney, professor
and head of the department of

sponsored by Musical America
and Music News. The award was
made recently at the annual fes-
tival of the National Composers
Congress in Colorado Springs,

Full Fall Program

The University is preparing for
one ofthe fullest and most stimu-
lating years in its history. Enroll-
ment will be increased by more
than 800 returning war veterans
and by the many thousands who
left school temporarily to go into
industry. These and others freed
from war duties will come to col-
lege. Lastly, Pitt’s' regular enroll-
ment is expected to increase with
the new emphasis on education.

The University is prepared to
meet the challenge of today with
many new programs. For classes
in aviation and aeronautical en-
gineering, an Army Air Force P-51
Mustang has been purchased. Its
design and operation will be
studied. It is one of a number of
pieces of aviation equipment the
University is acquiring.

The School of Engineering will
give courses in aerodynamics, in.‘
engines and propellors, and in air-
plane design. There will also be
an airplane laboratory for the
study of the complete structural
and aerodynamic design of heav-
ier than air craft and also for
aircraft drafting, standards, static
testing, ‘wind tunnel testing, and
rigging.

The College commences its sec-
ond year permitting aviation as a
major subject for graduation. Four
ﬁelds of specialization are allow-
ed, aviation, aviation geography,
phy.sics-meteorology, and mathe-
matics-navigation.

A new education laboratory will
correlate all factors -of effective
teaching. Many other ﬁelds will be
