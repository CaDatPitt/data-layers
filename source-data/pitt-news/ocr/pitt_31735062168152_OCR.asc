:RICHARD NIXON

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

For millions of draft-eli-
gible men, the university may
not provide a haven of re-
fuge much longer."

In a message April 23, Pres-
ident Richard M. Nixon called
for the gradual abolition of
the present draft

while stressing the need for re-
moving existing inequities for
the time being.

Nixon expressed confidence
that _a__yo_lunteer_ army can be-

come a reality in the near fu-

ture. The President hopes to ac-

system, _

complish this by virtue of salary

hikes and occupational incen-
tives.
In the meantime. however.

Nixon cautioned that an imme-
diate end to the draft is imprac-
tical because of “the necessity
of maintaining required military
force levels to meet our commit-
ments in Viet Nam and else-
where.”

To make the draft more equit-
able, the President ordered a
halt to paternal,‘ occupational,
and agricultural deferments, and
also urged a stoppage of student
deferments. According to the
Chief Executive, these “are no
longer dictated by —the national
interest.”

Should the proposed legisla-
tion be passed, all future re-
quests for deferments. what-
ever the reason, will be denied.
Students drafted during the
ourse of their studies would be
allowed to delay induction pend-
ing completion of that semes-
ter. Exceptions will still be
made in extreme hardship cases,
as they are so today.

Students and employees pre-
sently holding deferments would
continue to do so until their
classified statuses expire.

The Presidents second pro-
posal calls for the establishment
of -a national lottery. “We need
to ensure,” Nixon declared, “that
men throughout the country

with the same lottery number

have equal liability, to induc-
tion.” Under present conditions,
he pointed out. some draft
boards call only the lower num-
bers (1-120). whileothers call
numbers as high as 300.

Black Enrollrneiit Up
4587 Frtish Adinitlctl

by JUDY VOLLMER

The Admissions Office has
sent admit letters to 4587 pros-
pective freshmen for the fall
term of 1970.. Admits for fall '69
totalled 4130, Of these admits.

approximately 52 percent of the '

students generally accept, leav-
ing the freshman class for fall
'70 at about 2500 students. Black
students enrolled in the fresh-
man class for fall number’ 358.
over 100 more than last fall's
250.

Admissions requirements of the
University are still based on SAT
scores. highsschool class rank.
and teachers’ recommendations.
For fall '70 the Admissions Of-
fice has named the following cri-
teria for black high school "stu-
dents: apparent motivation. gen-
eral maturity. academic and

_ self-concept (as explained through "

teachers’ rep_orts and‘ an inter;
iew), peer-group identification.
and ’ extra-curricular activities.
By evaluating these criteria, the

‘Admissions Office can establish

programs through which black
students can orient themselves

Within the University special
programs have been instituted
for black students who have not
‘experienced adequate high school
_backgrounds. These programs
enable black students to adjust
to college learning material more
easily. ' —

Mr. Pharoah of the admissions

office explained that “

We had a little game we used
to play when we were younger
called “capping” or more com-
monly, “playing the dozens”.

You could be a participant if
you possessed one quality; you
were poor. So of course it’s not
surprising that black children
7 were the biggest participants in

the game. ’

. “Hey man, I went down your

" house the other day,” John start-

edoff, “and the roaches was

 walking around with picket

 signs, talkin ’bout- “Unfair we
want the radio in our room."

“Oh yeh," his verbal victim

would snap. "Well I done heard

. that your daddy works on a

‘garbage truck, for a dollar a day,
and all he can eat.”

We would all be doubled over
, with laughter, including the
two opponents, when someone
I else would blurt out, "Ooh, man
‘you gonna take that? He really
burn’t you." To be burn’t was
the height of defeat, and we
‘knew that if John didn't come
back with a really strong "cap"
he wouldn't be able to hold up
« hishead forawhile.

"No why?" "Because ants got

Things were getting heated.
We had laughed equally hard at
each one’s cap, but it was get-
ting near dinner time. Everyone
wanted to remain through, and
see who would win.

It was sort of silently resolv-
ed that both of them would give
one more cap.

Sammy quickly let fly with his
remark. "Hey John. they tell me
that when the garbage men

We all started to laugh, then
we looked at Sammy's face. He
wasn't laughing. John had brok-
en the rules. He had said some-
thing too ‘close to being true. to
really be funny.

And then I realized that all the
things they had been saying
about each other were true.
Sure the way they said them.
and the atmosphere made them
funny: but the objects that were
used in each "cap"; the rats. the
roaches. poor clothing. not
enough food. inadequate hous-
ing. they all were true of each
and every one of us.

And you've been laughing. -jfust

But the frightening thing is
that kids are still “capping" and
"playing the dozens." and we
are still laughing.

y LENNIE COHEN
Special to The Pitt News

Remember way back about a
month or so ago we had a minor
hassle here and everybody
thought Pitt was going 'to close?

Remember how we all got it
together so that everybody on
campus was doing something —
from signing petitions to plan-
ning a march on Harrisburg —— so
that we could avoid the seeming
inevitable’?

Well. it's all back again! Here .

we go heading straight into an-
other year and the Legislature
is just where it was in Febru-
ary.

There’s already a 400 million
dollar deficit in next year’s bud-
get and nobody even knows what
the --budget will be this time. We
don’t have to go through the
same shit all over again.

We got stuck last term in a
last ditch stand against legisla-
tors who feared f'or their poli-
tical lives. (We also had a few
who stuck their necks out and
said that they would live up to
their responsibility. )

Well. the thing they were wor-

ried about is here — Primaries.

are on May 19. Let's get out and
do something for our friends -
and let's do something for our

~ enemies too.

Everybody knows about the
letter Representative Laudadio

sent out. Now we can answer

it: Is Pitt going to have to stand
on its own “two legs like a
man” or is Laudadio? Let’s
make our slogan Laudadio
Must Go!" And let's make sure
that all the Laudadio’s do.

We have two primaries at
least right her in Pitt's back-
yard that are of vital concern
to each of us.

Repression

First./in Shadyside Jeff Thomp-
son is trying to unseat the in-
cumbent Leonard Martino for
the House. Jeff has an uphill
fight but he's the type of young
independent who we need if
we're interested in revitalizing
the state government.

The campaign needs lots of
help — from literature hander
outers to office staff - call in
and help. You can call 441-7760
or 441-2064 to volunteer.

Gerry Kaufman is a familiar
figure to all of us. He's got a
primary opponent. too.

It seems that his opponent
thinks that Gerry has been
spending too much time speak-
ing at moratoriums and war pro-
tests and developing viable links
with unenfranchised segments
of the population in order to
try to make government more re-
sponsive.

..It seems like people don’t un-
derstand the whole link — that
Vietnam, the Military Industrial

Complex and the whole decision V
making process in the state are '

penalizing the people.

Well. Gerry has been the most
outspoken member of the Legis-
lature on subjects from abortion
reform to the war (he just in-
troduced a bill like the one in
Massachusetts here in Pennsyl-
vanial to the problem of state
taxes — we need an income tax
and full funding for our state
priorities.

Make sure that everyone you

know in Squirrel Hill and there- I

about knows that Gerry's run-
ning again.

We also have elections on oth-
er levels. There’s a race for Sen-
ator, that ought to be arousing
much more interest than it has.

illTiisThe Season To Be Political  

Norval Reece. who was Eu-
gene McCarthy's Pennsylvania
campaign chairman in 1968 is
running in the primary to chal-
enge Hugh Scott in the fall.

He’s running against one of
our old friends from the legis-
lature who was distinguished
only by his absence as a vocal
State Senator during the cam-
paign to save Pitt.

He also happens to represent
the City of Erie — famous most-
ly for its now dead Great Lake.

He's the only peace candidate
in the race and the only one who
can hope to beat Hugh Scott —
Nixon‘s man in the Senate.

Reece needs much help — and
you’ can start early by helping
to plan and publicize the rally
and continuing on through the

primary May 19 and the general .

election in November as a volun-
teer.

There is a headquarters for
Reece on Forbes across the street
from the A & P and you can call
to volunteer there at 621-6010 or
call Vic‘ Papale at x 371.

There are also other campaigns
around the area —— from Commit-
teeman to Governor. ‘Interesting
races on the ‘Congressional level

include Byrd Brown’s challenge,

of Congressman William Moore-
head and Marty Wexelman’ chal-
lenge of Congressman Corbett.

All'of these campaigns bear
watching and help is always
needed. Perhaps the most effec-
tive, if not quickest way to
bring change will ultimately be
through the system. It’s certain-
ly worth a try.

Post Office Threatens Privacy

by RUSS TRUNZO '
Repression Information
Service Committee

RISC has recently put togeth-
er some facts that indicate that
the Post Office may have of-
ficially become -an arm of poll-
tical repression. Radical lead-
ers and activists have been hav-
ing their mail tampered with
for severalivears. but never with
the frequency and seeming of-

ficial sanctioning of this prac— .

tice that‘s been demonstrated
lately. ‘

We received a report from Re-
sist, the radical funding agency
in Boston. in which they charge

that mail which comes to them

from Chicago hasbeen opened
and resealed at the post office
there_— they further charge that
numerous letters never reach
their office. ’

’, “ACCIDENTALLY”

The action that gives the key.
to the official sanction is that a
number of letters sent to Resist
have been sent to an Internal
Revenue Service office in Bos-
ton. opened there. resealed and
stamped Open Accidentally -at
IRS Office, then sent on to Re-

-sist. By itself this action seems

like improper snooping. ’but
when considered ‘beside other
reports. it takes on a conspira-
torialtone.

Every month Resist considers
requests formoney from Move-
ment groups all over the country.

‘and has funded projects in all

areas of Movement activity.

IRS announced quietly that it

tributed to' all three organiza-
tions.

More Yet

In anotherepisode, an anti-
war GI newspaper (Vietnam G1)
in Chicago was forced to sus-
pend publication because of
tampering with their mail. A
much-needed check was mailed
to Vietnam GI from Boston on
November 1-7 and was finally de-
liveredlin mid-January.

Much of Vietnam GI‘s Novem-
ber and December mail also be-
gan to arrive about that time.
Resist people know of at least
two other checks that were de-
layed and may never have been
delivered.

lack of funds the paper had to

BUGGING THE SHOWER

Several years ago a micro-
phone was developed that is a
one inch cube and can pick up

a conversation two blocks away,

on the street.

By switching one wire‘ the av-
erage telephone can be made
into a receiver that will pick up
all sounds in a radius of 30 feet-
and transmit them anywhere in
the world.

The only safe place to talk is
in a ‘bathroom with the shower
running. and by now someones-
probably figured out how to
bug that. too. '

These bugging methods, and
others. far more sophisticated,
have been developed and used
with government. sanction, and
in many cases government mon-
ey. . , -

N_ow letters are opened and
read with that‘ same sanction.

How Our Reviewer Sees It; A Letter To A Letter

 

(Editor's Note: Arthur Rosen-
berg, Drama Critic for The Pitt
News favorably reviewed the
University Theatre production of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
AI‘e Dead by Tom Stoppard in
the March l0, i970 issue. His
evaluation was subsequently cri-
ticized by their Senior Mary Ro-
berts in the April 3 issue. Since
Miss Robert's letter appeared in
the edition of the paper for the
Winter Term, Mr. Rosenberg
was unable to respond to her
analysis. As a result, The Pitt
News is printing his answer
along. with the original text of
the letter.)

Robert Reevaluates

Dear Mr. Rosenberg.

'As a student of theatre and a
worker in the Pitt theatre group
for two years and as a member
of the opening night audience of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, I
found your praise of this produc-
tion extravagant, unfounded and
difficult to believe.

‘v‘Ponderous,”-_» a word you used
in your review to state what R.
and G. was not. is my verdict
exactly.

The main point with which I
take serious issue is your lavish
praise of Dr. Curtis Canfield’s
direction. Granted. his credits
are impressive. but I trust that
our analysis of his work is to
be founded on the present and
not the past. .

Your simple definition of the
director's task "for those who
don‘t know the /’fole" will serve
us well enough. for it is precise-
ly where Dr. Canfield fails.
There is no life in what hap-
pens on Foster stage; R. and G.
is dead. ' ' .

Except for Nemitz and brief
flashes from Frezza. R. and G.
has all the movement of a series
of turnpike billboards. all the
suspense of reaching the next

turnpike exit. and all the excite-
ment of getting there. It is a
tedious drive to an expected end.

The actors do not move. ex-
cept from the head: it is a pro-
duction of flapping mouths and
hollow souls. What you refer
to as "flow“ is merely the fore-
ward movement of a well-oiled
machine: what you so casually
dub "timing" is merely tight cue-
ing.

Do you recognize the differ-
ence‘? Do you realize that the
only value of a machine-gun bar-
rage of lines is to make an au-
dience have serious doubts as

to whether anything is hap-
pening inside these actors. these
people‘?

"Inspiration"? 1 found little.
"Invention"? Of a cool. clinical
sort—not my taste. "Feeling"?
Tom Spinella picked his nose
with conviction. Kudoes to him.

R. and G. is "intelligent." po-
tentially "brilliant“ theatre. but
not as Dr. Canfield has conceiv-
ed it. If you cared about these
people (which is essential in
my opinion). it is not because of
what the director put out. but be-
cause of the tremendous amount
of feeling you put in. -

An audience deserves more
than that; they deserve more
than a parade of cardboard cut-
outs for their evening in the
theatre.

The Pentangle. England’s ex-
citing new rock group. is on tour
in the United States and will be
making a special appearance on
the Pitt campus. On Thursday.
May 7. the Pentangle will perform
in concert in the Student Union
Ballroom at 7:30 p.m.

The Pentangle has a sound com-
pletely its own. It has successful-
ly knocked down traditional musi-

cal barriers andincorporated the . -

various types — folk. classical.
blues. and jazz—~into a musical
whole. Pentangle’s repertoire is
just as innovative as its sound.
The group plays old British folk
songs. original numbers. old blues
and Charles lVIingus songs. plus an
occasional spiritual.

The Pentangle consists of two

excellent guitarists. John Hen-
bourn and Bert Jansch; a bassist.
Danny Thompson: a drummer.
Terry Cox; and a lovely girl with
a beautiful voice,‘ Jacquie McShee.

The two guitarists, Bert Jansch
and John Renbourn, -are well es-
tablished names in the folk world

where their guitar styles have’

been particularly‘ influential. They
bring into the group elements of
folk, blues, and classical music
that contribute to the Pentangle’s
original repertoire.

Danny Thompson. a 'brilliant

bass player. and Terry Cox..an in- .

  

telligent. understanding drum-
mer. tie everything together ex-
pertly. These rwo musicans. who
have names as first class ja_zz
men, provide a strong rythym sec-
tions and. take constructive solo
roles in the general Pentangle
pattern.

Jacqui McShee does much of
the singing within the group. ei-
ther working solo or dueting with

Bert or John. Her clear. lilting-

voice can handle anything from an

unaccompanied folk song to a.

modern blues and is an integral
part of‘ the Pentangle’s sound.

The Men’s Glee Club returned
April 27 from a ten day tour which
took them to Washington. D. C..
North Carolina, Kentucky, and the
Detroit area.

While away, the Glee Club com-
piled an impressive score of near-
ly a dozen encores. Audiences re-
sponded with particular enthusi-
asm to the staged second half of
each concert, which consisted of
much lighter fare than the first.

Traveling by chartered bus. the
Glee Club proceeded at the outset
to Washington, D. C., where it
performed for local alumni at a
dinner attended by Chancellor
Posvar, who later thanked‘ and
complimented the club. '

Although.‘ the men took full ad-
vantage of the District of Colum-

bia’s low drinkin _age afterwards, _

they were nevertheless able to

V Editor's Note: The Mora-
; torium Committee, which :0-
ordinated last fall's national
protest against the war in
“ Vietnam, decided April, 18
to disband. Following is an
analysis of the Committee's
- reasons for closing.

by LENNY KLAVONIC
Contributing Writer$a

The Moratorium Committee
3 was founded as a broad-based

liberal coalition, a national pub-

uc_ movement to support the im-
mediate withdrawal of troops
"from Vietnam. The desire for
peace also fostered the forma-
tion of independent localized
groups in areas which had never
V, before encountered the physical
''_reality of the anti-war demon-
f stration and rally.

During the fall, the Mora-

 torium Committee provided the ~
‘stimulus necessary to spotlight‘

'— _ the drama of a national peace
.; movement, co-ordinating the
 massive rallies and work stop-
_- pages of" local groups on Octo-
_', g-her 15. The purposes of the Mor-
 atorium Committee dictated
' I that work stoppages be created
each month beginning with the
one day in October and an addi-
tional day each month until the
war was ended.

However, in November. it was
the two Mobilization Committees
who sponsored the massive anti-
_Ii war demonstrations in Wash-
}-ington and San Francisco. with

‘little work, but a large amount
of credit attributed to the Mora-
gtorium Committee. Had the work
. stoppages continued according
‘L/=(~-.l,to_Vplan. May would have seen

 

Page 10+-THE PITT NEws—'ruesday. Mayi 5» 1970

  oratorium Commi t tce
    Senses A Decline

an eight-day halt to business
activity.

On April 18. just three days,
after the massive demonstrations
in which over one million Ameri-
cans protested war taxes. the
staff and organizers of the Mora-
torium Committee met in Wash-
ington to determine the future
course of the organization.

With‘ the heavy frustration
of the April 15 protest causing
"little immediate change in the

administrations policy in Viet-

nam." the Moratorium Commit-
tee announced that it had reach-
ed its maximum period of effec-
tiveness and rather than "be-
come part of an anti-war beaura—
cracy that continues to exist
only because it has a national

office.“ decided to close the
national Committee offices in
Washington.

Additionally, the donations of
the anti-war movement, which
had reached nearly -12,000 a
week in the fall, trickled off

to virtually nothing. The Mora-
torium Committee is now faced
with debts exceeding upwards of
$100,000.

The strategy of the Morator-
ium Committee. although tem-
porarily successful. was in vast
need of renewal. Sam Brown.
one of the original founders.
stated at the closing that "We.
have been spending far too much
time keeping the offices oper-
ating. and not enough time do-
ing what we are supposed to do-
help end the war."

The Moratorium Committee
could no longer fulfill its needs

as an institution.

/night and the atmosphere at the
Arena was almost carnival. It
was at the first Doors concert
back in September that the pat-
tern had been set for shows that
followed. the inevitable bitter
confrontation with police and
ushers in the midst of rock mus-
IC that invoked that very thing.
Yes. the Doors of “we want the
world and we want it now"
lame were back in Pittsburgh.
and the crowd was anxious to get

 on.

Blues Image opened the show
with an impressive set that got
things rolling. With the excep-
tion of one droning buzz by
the RA. system. it was good
listening. as they did tight blues
that featured some jazz-influenc-
ed instrumentation and closed
with an over-long but otherwise
entertaining work on the conga
drums.

Mr. Good Guy came back to
the stage to repeat his commer-
cial for the management. and
then he introduced the Doors.

The Doors have been person-
ally disappointing in concert,

But then, surprise-new songs:

bluesy thing called Freight

delivered. As Manzarek‘s organ
sounded out the opening chords.
Morrison turned to Bobby Krieg-
er and smiled and they all smiled
as if to say "here we go again".
But it was a different song this
time. Aside from taunting the
audience with animal calls and
orgasmic groans. Morrison

changed the lyrics a little and
softened the delivery so it all
didn't sound quite so bitter.

It went forabout twenty min-
utes and included a medley of
“Break on Through” and “Soft
Parade”. Forgetting house rules,
Morrison asked for a cigarette,
got probably a carton, and he
and Manzarek lit up._ Then they
did a song sung by Manzarek with
Morrison doing the ‘chorus
called “Get Close To You”. _It»
had lyrics like, “I wanna get
close to you Pittsburgh like pig
is to poke”, and the audience

got the message. Like dozens of

baby snakes breaking from their
eggs, long lines slithered down
the aisles and up to the stage.

The lights were on now and
or once the chaos had been al-
allowed to forge into a peculiar
togetherness. It has been said

that the Doorszdig Pittsburgh-

and the affection was evident.
Krieger went into a sort of jig
as.he played his guitar. Dens-
more wailed on the drums, and

"with. a broad grin on his face
Manzarek, led them into “Light

My Fire’.’.. Morrison was vault-
ing about the stage like a cheer-
leader, kissing and being kissed
and touching hands and holding
up some of the .bras that had
been adoringly thrown at him.

When they finished,. they left
the stage quickly. and there was

no reason to stand and scream
"more". It had all been there.
There had been no violence and
more importantly. the police had
been shown that they weren‘t

needed. A few of them were.

even grinning.

dissatisfaction and statement of
such displeasure with this pro-

Any dichotomy between your
possible allusion or preference
between classical and the Stan-
islavsky method is irrevelent as
far as the judgement of the fin-
alproduct.

Dr. Canfields background is
described and, I believe, justly
so. We discuss a man, who be-
cause of previous accomplish-
ments should be expected to
produce much more than a “so-
so” product. ' .

If I had Said "If Canfield's
past is .to meananything. it is
only to show decay in the pre-
sent" — my presentation of cre-
dentials would have had as much
meaning in context.

Fortunately Dr._Canfield _
shows no such direction-with this
producti‘on‘as valid proof of his
continuing ability to do what

he has done so well.

In reference to the directors
role, the play itself dictates re-
strictions in regard to manner of
presentation. There is .a point
where_ the directors skill and

’ creativity or lack of it maylead

to distortion. 4

which may be taken and at the

PITTSBURGH

    

Wojtyna designed prize-winning
emblem.

John P. Wojtyna. a sophomore
in the University of Pittsburghs
School of Engineering. has sub-
mitted the winning design in a
competition for an emblem for
the School.

At a recent awards dinner. Mr.
Wojtyna was presented with a
$25 check by H. E. Hoelscher.
Dean of the School of Engin-
eering.

Sponsor of the contest was
The Engineering Bulletin, a
newsletter published by under-

graduate students in the engin-
eering school.- Mr. Howard T.
Allerton. vice president of a
Pittsburgh creative marketing and
design firm. served as judge of
the competition.

The emblem consists of a
meridian globe set in a triangle
with vertices bisected within the
University of Pittsburgh shield.
According to Mr. Wojtyna. “The
equilateral triangle is symbolic
of equality and perfection. The
three rays bisecting the vertices
of the triangle signify the
Schools involvement in all dir-
ections and every aspect of man's
existence."

Mr. Wojtyna is a major in
civil engineering and a member
of the American Society of Civ-
il Engineers and of GASP (Group
Against Smog and Pollution).
The son of Mr. and Mrs. Edward
Wojtyna of 244 Grandview Bou-
levard. Butler. Pennsylvania. he
has a quality point average of
3.16 and plans to work as a
landscape architect.

Text of New C ‘ailing Policies

Editor's Note: The Faculty
of Arts and Sciences (FAS) vot-
ed April 9 to drastically revise
grading procedures in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS).
Following is the text of the new
grading policies, which will be
implemented in the fall.

WHEREAS
The methods of evaluation
used in undergraduate courses

are of central importance in in-
fluencing the nature and quality
of the education acquired by
students:

The results of evaluation.
when properly transmitted. serve
many vital purposes. such as in-
forming students of their ability
and their progress. helping fac-
ulty and others to judge the stu-
dents potential for further work
in specific areas. and certifying
to the university the student's
progress toward a degree; and

A certain degree of uniformity
of practice in applying methods
of evaluation and in recording
the results is necessary both if
these purposes are to be served
and if equity in treatment of stu-
dents is to be protected:

THEREFORE BE IT
ENACTED THAT
..IlI Each student shall have a
transcript recording all grades
in which credit is awarded.

I2» There shall be two options
for evaluations that must be en-
tered on the transcript IA) The
Letter Grade System. and tB>
The Credit-No Entry System.

(A) Letter Grades shall be as
follows:

A: Superiorattainment:

..B: _ _Meritorious attainment:

C: . .Satisfactory work:

D: . .Barely competent work:

F: Failure to do work of even

G: Work incomplete. for rea-
sons beyond the student's con-
trol: ‘

I: Work incomplete.

N: Non-credit. audit: and

W: . .Withdrawal from course
with no penalty and no credit.

(B) The Credit-No Entry
Grade shall be as follows:

quirement passed by FAS on
January 31, 1970, shall remain
in force, as shall the traditional
rules governing the calculation
of quality point averages and
the minimum allowable cumula-
tive QPA.

(4) Subject to the restrictions
provided in paragraph eight,
there shall be no numerical lim-
it to the number of courses a stu-
dent may elect to take on a
Credit-No Entry Basis.

(5) Students shall decide by
the end of the add period (two
weeks after classes begin) which
grading system they wish touse
in a given course. This decision
may not be changed nor may
a grade of one kind awarded for
a course be replaced by a grade
of the other kind for that course.

(6) Eligibility for mention on
the Dean's List shall be restrict-

grades of A. B. C. D. or F in
at least 12 credits during the

(7) While no student can be
refused the option of taking any
course on a Credit-No Entry
Basis. departments may feel that
some of their courses are of such
a nature that they should not be
graded on the letter-grade sys-
tem. In such cases. departments,
may with the agreement of the
instructor teaching the course.
request permission from CASC
to give the course solely on a
Credit-No Entry Basis.

(8) Departments shall have the
option of deciding which courses
‘required for a major, if any,
may be taken on a Credit-No
Entry Basis. Since._one major
purpose of the Credit-No Entry-

c System is to encourage students

to investigate disciplines with
which they are unfamiliar. CAS

PHILADELPHIA — (CPS) —
Pennsylvania‘s new law designed
to curb student disrupters has
run into heavy fire from edu-
cational institutions, with sev-
eral colleges refusing to abide
by it.

The law requires colleges who

students receive aid from » the

Pennsylvania State Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Agency to re-
port» to the state if any student
receiving assistance has been con-
victed of disruptive activity.

At least eight colleges have
refused to sign up, thereby dis-
qualifying their students for aid
from the state agency. ‘These in-
clude Stanford, Clemson, Iowa
State, Radcliffe, Edison Jr. Col-
lege in Florida, the University
‘of Connecticut, the University

of Cincinnati, and- Philadelphia’s

Haverford College.

Yale University has sent a let-
terrequesting clarification, and

numerous other universities are 

awaiting the reply to Yale be-
fore making any decisions. -

"anti-riot” riders have’b_een in-

third baseman Ken Macha hit his four-run smash in the second game, giv-

A Ridl After
Top Cagers

 

by BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor £3
Coach Buzz Ridl and his assistants have picked-up some
(dandy recruits for next year, but can't forget the one that got
-away.

 
 

 ” Four scholarship and several walk-on basketball players
 have enrolled at Pitt for next fall. Another was within a few
hours of announcing to the public that he intended to be-
come a Panther hoopster. '

The player who escaped the Panthers’ grasp was Schen-
ley’s 6’7” All-Stater Clarence Hopson.

“I still can't believe it,” Ridl commented.
press conference set-up to an-  z
nounce his signing, but he
called it off at the last sec-
ond.”

_ Many observers feel that St.
Francis College (Loretto, Pa.)
matched Ridl’s prize catch ,.
when the school offered Hop-
son the first annual Maurice -
Stokes Memorial Scholarship.

When Hopson decided to
attend Stokes’ alma mater,  if
the Panthers were forced to I’
search right and left for an- ”
other good big man. Ridl had
» hoped to obtain both Hopson "
A y and Braddock star Bill Knight.
Currently, Knight and a 6’9”
basketstuffer from Washington,“
D.C. are the prime prospects
' ‘ on Ridl’s shopping list.
According to Ridl, his ini- ;
tial three recruits Jim Bolla,  ;_
Mickey Martin, and Ken Wag- M 
oner are all “topflight.” He
mentioned that Canevin’s 6'8”
Bolla has tremendous jumping power and that Baldwin’s Mar-
— , tin is an excellent all-around performer.

“Martin (a high school forward) can play guard at -6’5”
and that makes him even more valuable,” Ridl stated.

_ Wagoner, a 6’1” guard from Beaver Falls, reportedly was
 the player who held the Pennsylvania state champions to-
. gether on both offense and defense." ~ '
“His feeding led to alotof scores,” Ridl said. “He play-
7 g ed a quiet role, but I was very impressed with him.”

F Erie Strong Vincent’s Bill Swartzman has also decided to
7 lend the Panthers a helping hand—a big hand. He’s 6’8”. He
I will not receive an athletic scholarship, and therefore Ridl
‘A can remain optimistic about recruiting the tallest freshman
team in Panther history. Swartzman was one of the leading
scorers and rebounders in Northwestern Pennsylvania.

A It will also be announced—maybe shortly after this paper
* goes to press—-that the Panthers have added one of the most
ﬂ “sought-after players in the state. He has been named on one
V. of the first three All-State squads and averaged nearly 30
 points a game. He accumulated over 1,900 pointsin his high
school career.

»g Also, Lou Myers, a 6’4” guard-forward from South Hills
High School, has assured Ridl that he will be a walk-on for
the 1970-71 Cub freshman team. 4 ' »

in Morgantown and gaining his
first victory as a Pitt hurler.

_ The Cats’ 7-4 win in the night-
cap prevented a Mountaineer
sweep after West Virginia tag-
ged George Medich for five
earned runs (the most he's ever
given in a game) and a 6-4 loss.

Muse replaced tarter Mike Nic-
cols in the fifth inning of game
two after WVU’s leftfielder, Lar-
ry Myers, singled and was sacri-
ficed to second base. with the
Panthers ahead 4-3.

P Muse protected the lead, but

Niccols didn’t receive the victory ,

because he didn’t pitch five com-
lete innings, the distance a start-
er must survive even in the seven
inning games that constitute col-
lege baseball’s double headers.

Pitt coach Bobby Lewis wasn’t
concerned about which pitcher
was going to gain credit. He just
wanted to get one win out of the
cold day's action.

The weather was not exactly
the type a baseball player pre-
fers. There were no thermome-
ters around WVU‘s new Hawley
Field on their Evansdale Cam-
pus, but the Panther players
who left their jackets at home
leaped ‘at the chance to don un-
sed jackets to guard against
the cold wind.

Around the time Lewis insert-

ed Muse there was a rather cold

Ump s Tosses
Cliff Brown

During the difficulty with the
umpires Saturday Pitt Captain
Cliff Brown became the first
‘Panther to be tossedout of a
game this season. And, like most
ejections there was an amusing
as well as damaging tale to the
argument.‘

Ken Macha was at the plate

" with two strikes against him and

the bases loaded with two outs
inthe last inning (the seventh)
of the first game; Brown, who
was waiting on deck, was tell-
ing some of his teammates a
story about an umpire’s prob-
lems in a past game. Suddenly
the home plate umpire turned to
brown and yelled, “You with
the bat you’re not batting! You
know what you said: And.I know
what you said. And you know
what I said. so you’re out of the
game." , - ~

Macha, by the way, belted the
next pitch for a three run triple
meaning that Brown would have
represented thetying run if he
would have gone to the plate.
pinch hitter Bob Livingston
struck out.

* * *

Panther baseball finally open-
ed at an on-campus field with a
double header victory over Steu-
benville. April 20. One of the
ground crew who prepared the
field, Abbey Lamonde, threw out
the first ball, as Horse Czar-
necki. head groundskeeper pro-
claimed, “This is the first home
opener in twenty years" . . . By
the way. a suggestion was made

.that day that the ‘‘unnamed‘‘

All-Purpose Fields which include
the baseball diamond be given a
name. The suggestion: Carlson

the toughest for him. The Moun-

two outs via two walks and a

to the victory by striking out

Larry Boggs.‘ '

6-Hour Match

by MIKE MILLER

The tennis team bowed to West Virginia. 5-4. Saturday, in a
match Coach Fran Webster described as a "six hour seige.”

"It was one of the longest matches I’ve ever seen." stated

Webster.

"Everyone went three sets.

doubles match."

The match was played despite
the intermittent rain. The weath-
er effected both sides according
to Webster, but he felt that the
wet courts were responsible for
the loss of some points.

“It affected both sides, but
we were unfortunate enough
slip at the wrong times.
There were times when the wet
courts made it impossible to re-
turn the ball." he said.

Webster feels that his
A freshmen, Joel Hurwitz and
Mike Oloughlin. have been

playing the most consistent ten-
nis.

Webster has noted improve-
ment in the entire team. He
also said that if Tom Stromp,
his number one man, was
playing to his potential the
team could win all of their
matches, with the possible excep-

1 tion of Penn State. ‘

/Webster attributes recent
losses to two things; some of his
players have been sick and
others left school when the spring
term began.

Now. however. he feels that

the team is back to_ normal. Of

It wasn’t settled until the last

the four matches scheduled for
this week, Webster contends that
his squad can win at least two
and give the other two a battle.

He has expressed optimism
about the matches with Slippery
Rock and Buffalo. He mentioned
that Westminster has a superior
team. Webster also suggested that
the contest with Syracuse could
go either way.

by VINCE DiNARDO

The Pitt track team was de-
nied a victory on -Saturday at the
Big Four Meet at West-Virginia.
The tracksters lost to Penn State
by the score of 77-75 as the re-
sult of a disqualification of the
Pitt mile relay team.

The disqualification occur-
red when a Pitt runner was de-
clared out of the ‘allowed zone
on the handoff of the baton. A
win in this event would have
assured the Thinclads a victory
instead of a second place.

The turn of events was es-
pecially disappointing to Coach
Jim Banner. "We could have
beaten any of those teams indi-
vidually.“ stated Banner.

“West-Virginia and Syracuse

_didn’t help us any as they scor-

 ed only 30 points between them."

Penn State (the winner) scor-
ed 77 points while Pittscored
75. The competition stopped
there. West-Virginia, the hosts
managed only 18 points while
Syracuse fared even worse as
they scored only'12 points.

Pitt‘s formidable bid was

made possible by the strong per-
formances of Dorel Watley, Dan

Carlos Riesen. meanwhile, set

ne of Pitt's five meet records
in the 440 intermediate hurdles.
Richey set the meet record
in the mile. Steve Hein and Bill
Kalchthalter also set marks for
Pitt. Hein set a new record in

the discus while Kalchthalter, a.

freshman, broke the record in
the 120 yard high hurdles. Penn
State achieved two new records.

Marty Halmo set the 880
record while the mile relay
team also produced a new re-
cord. Both Pitt and Penn State
took eight first places. ‘

The Thinclads steered clear
of injuries at West Virginia;
and with the return of Dave
Cheseborough to the squad. the
tracksters should be in good
shape. However, Lou Frank is
out with an injury as is Ken
Silay. Silay will be lost to Ban-
ner for the entire outdoor sea-
son.

The poise and throwing abil-

the surprises that Coach Carl
DePasqua noted by the conclu-
sion of this-season's_drills.

Split end Doug Ginden was
another treat that sparkled be-
fore De,Pasqua’s intent watch.
Ginden paced all receivers in
the spring contest by snagging
six passes for 61 yards.’ ’ »

' _the set-up probably was not ad-

vantageous for the public.

Instead of dividing the team
‘into two squads composed of
both an offense and a defense.
the Panthers maintained only

one offensive group and one de- .

fensive group. It resembled a
fullescalé scrimmage much more
closely than it did a game. b ,.

DePasqua also mystified the
audience by sending Phil Sgrig-
noli and Dave Garnett in with
most of -the first stringers in

, place of Denny Ferris and Tony
Esposito.

"We know what Denny ' and .

Tony can do." DePasqua ire-

Coach DePasqua has been
pleased with the progress of
his defensive line. There should
be some good competition for
defensive tackle with Howard
Broadhead. Bruce Harkiewicz.
John Stevens. and Lloyd Weston
vieing for starting positions.

WTAE’s Myron Cope liked
what he saw at the spring game,
but noted that the Panthers
could suffer from lack of depth-
especially at quarterback.

There weren't any trick or
'fancy plays in this year's spring
game. Last year. DePasqua per-
mitted the Blue and Gold coaches
to try a few razzle-dazzle plays.
