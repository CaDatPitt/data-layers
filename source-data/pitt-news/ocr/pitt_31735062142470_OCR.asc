Pitt Players Choose Cast
For Next Presentation

Cast of'Pitt Players’ next show “Where Love Is” was
released today by Ruth Haun, instructor in speech, and di-
rector of the play. The play will be presented free of charge
on December 21 in the Commons Room. ’

“Where Love Is” is a Russian
Christmas story by Inge and is the

third in the international series of
plays Pitt Players will present this
year. Previously, “Abe Lincoln In
Illinois” and “Till The Day I Die,”
a German story, had been present-
ed. The play is dramatized from
Tolstoy’s story “Where Love Is,
There Is God Also.”

There are only ﬁve characters.
in the show which runs approxi-
mately half an hour. Martin, a
shoemaker, is p o r t r a y e d by
George Anas, BA45. Lester Sny-
der, C46, has the role of a mer-
chant; Elizabeth Lind, BA44, is
cast as a ‘young peasant woman;
the old apple woman is played

by Mirian Odle, C45; and John
Simpson and Richard McCarthy
C43, will alternately take the role
of Stepanuich, a village charac-
ter.

McCarthy'will assist Miss Haun
as student stage manager but the
Pitt Player assistant director has
not yet been selected. “Where Love
Is” will be taken on tour with “Till
The Day I Die’? which is currently
playing ‘at various recreational
centers in the -City of Pittsburgh.

All Pitt Player shows are pre-
sented without charge as part of
the University War Information
Center program of acquainting
civilians with the thought of other
nations and times. A

> If the navy officials are smart,
, they will give Lt. Robert X. Graham
a typewriter as part of his regular
9 ' equipment. “I just can’t think with-
S...-{out one,” claims the University
publicity director who received his
; navy commission last week. .
f ' He is going to have a lot of
 letters to write and the type-
J writer might help him to obey the
,“early to bed” rule while in the
service. Since last February, Mr.
' Graham has sent out 1062 sepa-
 rate letters to Pitt alumni in the
-armed forces. Some of these have

“R. X.”, as he is known to these
his ‘boys,” keps them posted about
University activities and about
what other alumni in the service
are doing. Even in the mimeo-
graphed letters, he has his little
jokes and does not stick to the for-
mal news writing style which he
taught to so many of these “boys.”

“My seven years at Pitt have
been busy but enjoyable, he
typed on a sheet of University
stationary (because he could not
express his thoughts about leav-
ing .without the typewriter).
“Work with student publications
staﬂs, with O.D.K., the Faculty

    
  

    
  

oﬂice has been stimulating. I
shall enjoy returning to the Uni-
versity when the war is over.”
When he returns, for he has been
granted merely a leave of absence
from the school, Mr. Graham will
probably have a lot of interesting
stories to tell; just like the ones
about his days as coach at West-
minster. "

At least, he will return with a
few thousand more names added
to his list of friends. “R.X.” just
couldn’t get along without his
friends,” stated Irwin Rosen, edi-

The plight of Chinese students is by now well
“known. .Though their universities were bombed-—they
.-;-built new ones. These new universities, the students
1’ believe are essential to Chinese resistance, and impor-
iftant to their future.
. Since their living quarters were destroyed by
 . bombs the students have lived in their schoolrooms,
‘ which serve as dormitories by night. They have no

social rooms, libraries or bathing facilities.
. _ To make up for lack of these, Student Service
C-enters have been established. The cost of upkeep
is approximately $600 a year. This is not very
in considering they provide
places where students may take baths—places for

which a group may read at one time.

One of Andy Patterson’s old girl
friends Doris Jacobs tells us that
he is engaged to Mt. Lebanon’s Pat-
ty Finnley. Place your bets on this
since there is no ring as yet.

Incidentally, another former dis-
traction of Andy’s, Lorna Hazelton,
has given a certain senior. girl a
mighty big scare, or haven’t you
noticed Mabe1’s pale look recently ?
The moral of the story is: never
underestimate a freshman.

Although Delt pledge, Kirk Mar-

interested in Martha even though

University Opens
Science Library

_ A new Science Technological li-
brary has been opened to gather to-
gether the books in the separate
chemistry, physics, and engineering
and mines collections. The new li-
brary will be situated on the second
ﬂoor of the Alumni building.

The collection of chemistry books
has already been moved to the new
site. A professional librarian who
has had scientiﬁc training, Miss
Julia Staniland, will be in charge of
the new l_ibrary. This is a greatly

needed improvement, according to;

Mr. G. F. Reynolds, assistant Uni-
versity librarian, since the individ-
ual collections were formerly under
the charge of amateur attendants.

Another improvement that will
result from this consolidation, ac-
cording to Mr. Reynolds, is that

the range of the library will be in--

creased, since books can now be
purchased that are not conﬁned
strictly to one ﬁeld, but lie some-
where between the separate depart-
ments. Under the former system,
each department bought books that
related to its ﬁeld speciﬁcally.

Most of the books will be placed
in open stacks so that students and
faculty can easily choose the books

V that they want. The library will be
open from 9 until 5:30 o’clock from
Monday to Friday, and 9 to 1
o’clock on Saturdays.

the week: What was said to Mable, 
Moore at the Tri-Delt meeting 

Monday night?

SAE Bill Howard is wondering’ f
who Polly McQuire is. Maybe if he»
would call the Theta house he would
ﬁnd the source of his mysterious- »

phone calls. The mysterious one
also goes under the alias of Gwen-
dolyn Moose.

The SAE’s have started some-
thing by introducing tea dances at
their house every Wednesday after-
noon. And talking of SAE’s Jim
DeGarmo and Lois Miller have de-

cided to let it be known to all that

they are going steady.

Milton Antonoplos is very much‘
»interested in- how Jeanne Goushe
spends her evenings. Reports are

that his date with her the time of

the PiKA winter formal was one of A I

his best yet. Incidentally a while
back we mentioned that he was also
dating his father’s cashiers. We
took time off Sunday to meet them
and . . . Wow! Just ask the PiKA
pledges about Johnette and Dee.

Things must be tough
smooth boys like immy Dunn have
to make dates a month in advance.

At any rate, one resolution this
year’s team is intent on keeping

-’ the promise of providing fifty or

more points per game. Caution has
‘#10 place in this year's setup. Their
. guiding principle is “shoot.”
’ In the exhibition tilts, the Carl-
? sonmen have made good on the
1 -5.0 points per game promise in all
2 but two games. They collected 54
points in their first game, but
still managed to lose 54-56. In two
games played with the Weiss
High Flyers the Pitts came out
with a 61-54 triumph and a 61-53
loss. But they did get their ﬁfty
points. ‘
They faltered somewhat in the

game played with the Irene Kauf-
mann Settlement quintet, being
short of 5 points although they did
win, 45 to 43. They thoroughly wal-

, loped the YMHA squad 53-33, but

‘failed again to get the ﬁfty points
in a 44-38 win over the Corbets of
the Muny League. And in their last

BASKETBALL TEAM AND FRIEND
1942: The Great Offensive

  

It was a great night for the
underdogs last Tuesday evening as
the prennial “also-rans” came
through with victories in every fra-
ternity basketball contest played.

Probably the biggest surprise of

the evening was the Phi Delta
Theta’s_ swamping win over last
year’s champions, Theta Chi. Of
course, the Theta Chi team without
the services of “Special Delivery”
Jones and “Wild Bill” Fitchko were
not expected to repeat as champions
but they were regarded with some
fear. After last week’s crushing
33-8 defeat, it looks as though they
have nothing more than a silent
prayer in this year”s league race.
The Phi Delts showed a speedy,
well-rounded combination that will
be in the thick of the cup race all
season.

Pi Kappa Alpha A.C. aided by
30odd pledges who won the foot-
ball trophy through sheer force of
numbers, expected the Sigma Chi’s
to be just another. team. But they
weren't as the 24-18 score can
easily prove.

Bobenace stole the show as he
connected for 11 points out of the

ﬁrst 13 tallies made in the game.
This lad undoubtedly, gave the

Dutton Named on AP All-American Team
West Invited To North-South Game

By ELAINE KAI-IN

Just as surely as there are foot-
ball games there are bound to be
All-Americans, but this year Pitt
nominations, like their
victories have been scarce.

Only two members of the 1942
squad have thus far been honored
with nominations, Walter \Vest,
Pitt's durable quarterback, and
“\Vild” Bill Dutton. West has been
invited to participate in the North-
South game. Dutton was named on
the Associated Press All-American
Team.

gridiron

It goes without saying that as
the team goes so goes the individual
player’s chances of making the
post-season All-Americans. Other-
wise it would be pretty hard to find
an All-American that would not in-
clude Pitt’s great back, Bill Dutton.
In what was otherwise a dull sea-

son Bill gave the fans something
to cheer about.

All season long he ran an excit-
ing race with Georgia’s Frankie
Sinkwich and Columbia’s Paul Gov-
ernali for the ground gaining

attend these meetings, for it is
through these meetings that they
can get any information they might
want. The ﬁrst team positions have
not been ﬁlled yet, so the possibili-
ty of ‘a newcomer being picked on
the competing team is quite evi-
dent, whether it be on the 10-man
ROTC team, or on the ﬁve-man
Varsity outﬁt.

It is notonecessary to be an ex-
pert to try out for the team. It is
required, however, that anyone
who wishes to be a member of
the Squad must be regular in his
attendance. Every member is ex-

pected to spend at least twenty
minutes every day practicing
either in the gun room or at the
range.
One change is to be noted in this
year’s practice sessions from those
of previous years. Formerly, the

practice range at the Stadium was‘
open from 3 to 5 ﬁve days a week..

This year, the coaches have decided
to open the stadium range only on
Thursday and Friday afternoons,
from 3 to 5 o’clock, and have open-
ed a supplementary range in the
Cathedral basement for dry shoot-
ing practice. Dry shooting is shoot-
ing  without «ammunition. This

honors. Prior to the Penn State

game Bill had gained a total of
1258 yards. However, the Lions
succeeded in bottling him up pretty
well in the ﬁnal clash of the season,
Bill gaining 34 yards, and losing
35 yards for a total of minus one
yard.

Dutton came back from the open-
ing game with Minnesota with four
of his front teeth missing, but the
shaking up must have done him
good, for he came back to have his
best season. He played such a
whale of a game against Great
Lakes, Indiana, and Duke that
many experts termed him one of
the greatest backs in the country.

Bill has been playing football
since his grad school days. He was
named all-West Virginia halfback
in 1938, following his play for
VVeston High School. But, although
this has been his own greatest
season, Bill still thinks his biggest
thrill came last year when Pitt up-
set Fordham 13-0.

He is a member of the Naval Re’-
serve and will enter the service
shortly after his graduation in
June.

range will be open from 8:30 to 5
o’clock Monday through Friday, in-

considered to be just as valuable
as they real thing.

Coaches of this year’s teams
are Major Wills, Captain Havlak,
and Sergeant Daehnke, who re-
placed Sergeant MacDonald ear-
ly in September. Sergeant
Daehnke will be directly respon-
sible for training the men.

Captain of the Varsity outﬁt is

Silverman To Speak . . .

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the department of chemistry, will

tute in Philadelphia on Wednesday,

December 16, on “Glass and The

Bar Association Dinner

Honors Judge Madden

Judge J. Warren Madden, U.S.
Court of Claims, will be the guest
of honor at a dinner held by the
members of the Allegheny County
Bar association. The dinner will be
held in the Pittsburgh Athletic as-
sociation tonight, Dean Judson A.
Crane of the Pitt Law school and
general chairman announced.

Judge Madden was a member of
the law school faculty from 1927 to
1935, when he was appointed chair-
man of the National Labor Rela-
tions board. He served on the labor
board until 1940, at which time he
was appointed to the court.

 

Sigma Chi a lead which they never
relinquished. J a c k McCloskey’s
stellar defensive play and superb
ball-handling shared the honors
with Bobenace.

Interfraternity competition in the
bowling league started last Monllay
afternoon. ’

The annual battle for blood b
twen the PiLams and the Phi Eps
resembled nothing more than a tea
party betwen sororities after the
blood bank had visited them. It was
dull, of course, and neither team did
anything that would make it appear
as though they intend to ﬁght for
the circuit trophy. The PiLams won,
23-17, largely through the sharp-
shooting ability of freshman Nate
Apple.

The score doesn’t tell half the
story as the larger, more aggressive
Pi Lambda Phi ﬁve completely Qant-
played the Phi Eps. It was not the
ability of the PiLams, it was the
lack of ability of the part of the
Phi Epsilon Pi aggregation.

Phi Kappa, playing this year
without either Charleroi Joe Con-
nell or Bobby Tyberski, failed to
halt the spedy Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon squad from winning, 43-14.
Only Johnny Sewaak prevented the
title-bound SAE’s from making it
a complete rout.

Two of the Greek tilts were pro-
tested. The Phi Gams, after losing,
protested the playing of former
basketer “Red” Silverman. This
protest was upheld by the athletic
inanagers of the various houses and
the game will be replayed.

Delta Tau Delta’s 26-24 victory
was likewise protested. This game
will also be replayed.

Clapp Awarded Medal

Dr. Frederick M. Clapp recently
received the Townsend Harris Med-
al in recognition of “his notable
post graduate attainments,” at the
sixty-second annual meeting of the
college’s Associate Alumni. Dr.
Clapp was head of the Fine Arts
departlhent at Pitt for ten years.
He was also the organizing direct-
or of the Frick collection and cre-
ator o:f the Frick Library of Art.
Besides being a teacher of Greek
and Italian, Dr. Clapp has written
several volumes of lyrics.

To Be Given

By Seniors At Dedication

“It’s a grand old ﬂag” is the slogan selected bythe Senior
Memorial Fund committee as the theme of their drive, Harriet
Harris,‘ C43, and Len S. Wolk, BA43, co—chairmen disclosed.

The balance of money contributed by the class of ’43 will

be deposited in a fund, the purpose
of which is the erection of a per-
manent ﬂagpole to be displayed in
front of the Belleﬁeld entrance of
the University. This ﬂagpole fund
was originally the idea of the class
of ’39; however, lack of sufﬁcient
funds has delayed the execution
of it.

As an immediate gift, the class
of ’43 will present a national flag
and a small pennant with the
University colors to be held by a
temporary shaft. The committee
stresses the point that this is

temporary. Due to priorities, a
permanent ﬂagpole cannot be
built until after the ﬁnish of the
war.

On each side there will be
benches where the students may
gather during the Spring and Fall.
In addition to serving as a court or
plaza the ﬂag center will be.used for
graduation purposes and for ROTC
drill. The Belleﬁeld entrance has
been chosen because it is the front
of the building, and in the future
all University buildings will face
this front.

 

Fraternity 2 Ball ‘
Date Changed

“Christmas” will be the theme of
the annual Interfraternity Ball
which will be held on Tuesday eve-
ning, December 22, in the main»ball-
room of the William Penn hotel.
Bobby Byrne’s sixteen piece band

will provide the music.

The yearly fraternity sing will
be conducted during intermission.
The winning team, which will be
judged by representatives of the
Sun Telegraph, The Press and the
University, will have an opportu-
nity to broadcast later in the eve-
ning.

Dress for the dance will be in-
formal and the price of admission
will be $3.50 plus tax. Leather pro-
grams will be distributed as favors.

Theme: American Freedoms

All previous yearbook sale records have been surpassed
by the 1943 Owl, Ed Rose, C44, publicity manager, stated to-
day. The total has been reached entirely by senior and junior L
sales, and the undergraduate sales have yet to begin, he said.

Rose predicted that this year's
sales will double the total reached
by any previous yearbook because
of an innovation to be’ announced
Tuesday.

This year’s Owl stresses Amer-
ican freedoms. The sections are
divided to correspond with the
rights guaranted us under the
“American Way.” The usual
abundance of photographs is
augmented by hundreds of
sketchs from the proliﬁc pen of
editor August Trovaioli.

James Hardie, C44, circulation
manager, asks all students who are
interested in selling the yearbook
to undergraduates to come to the
Owl office, 803 Cathedral, today and
Monday at 1:30 o’clock.

Forum to Hear Report

Holbert Carroll, C43, president of
Omicron Delta Kappa, will give a
report on the Public Affairs Con-
ference held at Princeton univer-
sity at the Monday luncheon Forum
to be held in 1228 Cathedral. Any-
one interested must sign up by to-
morrow at the latest, according to
John Shepherd, BA44.
