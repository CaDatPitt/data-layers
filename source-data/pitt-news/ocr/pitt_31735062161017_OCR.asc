Getting to Oakland half the fun for Pitt commuters

is Parking in Oakland is not a right.

According to the University of Pittsburgh
parking rules and regulations, “Parking is
not a right, it is a privilege available only
as provided by the official parking rules,
and regulation parking is premium.”

Kathy Miller, program manager for the _
University Health Center of Pittsburgh/
University of Pittsburgh Ride—sharing
program, said, “Commuting is tough
because Oakland is congested —
construction will  be there forever, and
this makes it very difficult to navigate.”

Factors that create congestion include
“[the fact that] this is a cosmopolitan area
and an international center with a lot of
research activity. Western [Psychiatric a
Institute and Clinic] is presently No. 1 in
research-grant funding in the country,

3

thus attracting quality faculty. [Pitt’s] book
center is the best in the city. There are six
hospitals in Oakland alone, making this a
critical area for ambulances, and there are
three fire trucks that report here," said
Miller. 4

“There are also lots of elderly people
here,” she continued, “prompting more
emergencies. The area is also a tourist
attraction. All of this makes navigation
very important. Gridlock occurs, which is
when cars are trying to ﬁnd parking but
are bumper-to—bumper.”

Pitt’s parking problem is evident when
compared to other universities. The
Department of Public Safety recently
received an inquiry from Indiana University
of Pennsylvania regarding parking. Indiana
officials claimed that their school has
16,000 parking spaces for the same number
of students as there are at Pitt. They found
that Pitt has only 3,000 parking spaces.

ZBT begins first
non-pledge term

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

As they prepare for their first
term without pledging, the
brothers of Pitt's chapter of Zeta
Beta Tau are optimistic that the
new plan will be the wave of the
future. ‘

“I’m very much for the
abolishment of pledging," said
Michael Neuman, president of
ZBT. “Not only at ZBT, but at all
other fraternities. _

“If we don’t do something about
the deaths due to hazing, and
there have been 44 in the past 10

years, fraternities will not be on

campuses in the next century.
This is the right thing to do.”

Under the new rules from the
fraternity’s national chapter, new
members must be initiated within
72 hours after the end of rush.

“There is no class system,”
Neuman said. “We are all brothers
on the same level."

Neuman compares the end of I

pledging to 1954, when ZBT,

formerly a Jewish fraternity,

became non-sectarian and began

accepting members from all ethnic

and racial origins. ‘
“That was a big day for

fraternities, and so is this. It is

Army ROTC targets
freshmen to enlist

ByJim Tezak
Asst. News Editor

A U.S. Army tank rolled into
Oakland on Monday and parked
itself on the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Forbes Avenue,
across from the Hillman Library.

Was Oakland being invaded?
Was the administration instituting
martial law at Pitt in an effort to
convince students to payjhigher
tuition rates?

No, the tank was brought here
by the University of Pittsburgh's
Reserve Oflicers Training Corp.
According to Capt. Raymond T.
Horoho, assistant professor of
military science, the tank was

brought in specifically to get the
attention of iiincomifig‘ fréslifhan:
“What we want is to get the
largest cross section of freshmen,
and sophomores who didn't take
advantage of the opportunity last
year to take a military science
course,” Horoho said.
According to Horoho, the
military science program teaches

0 students time management and

study habits for college classes,
in addition to introducing them
to the military. Students looking
for pait—time work can also receive
help with job placement, and
every student gets sit-down
counseling from a military adviser

With 100,000 cars coming through the
area every day, Oakland is the third-
heaviest traffic area in the state, behind
only the downtown areas of Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh. However, Miller says that
there is actually ‘excellent optimization of
land [in Oakland]. Every bit of available
land is used the best that it can be.” _

Over 15,000 students commute to Pitt
on an average day. However, not all drive;
some take the bus, ride a bike, or are
dropped off. Public safety officials advise
that if you live within five miles of Pitt, it
is best to take a bus. With the Port Authority
Transit’s main information number you
can get free time schedules, fares, and the
PAT system map: a comprehensive guide
which highlights Oakland. Another useful
item is the PAT Fax, which is a coupon you
can send in to have brochures sent to you.

Because of the parking problems,
dormitory residents are discouraged from

See’ ROTC page 4

bringing cars. There are also fraternity
parking regulations. Even apartment
residents cannot escape the problem. Many
need a permit to show they are residents
of their street. If you park on some side
streets without a permit, you will be given
a grace period of one hour, after which
you can be given a ticket amounting to
$32.50. I

Neither Pitt nor the hospitals receives
any of the money collected from university
or hospital lot parking meter fines. Pitt
monitors the lots twice a day, and pays a
20 to 25 percent tax for parking spaces to
the city. As part of its operation, Public
Safety checks lots and calls in license
numbers to see if cars are in the right lots.

If someone comes up on the computer
as not having a permit, he will get a ticket.
If ‘a student doesn't pay his_ tickets, a
special fee is added to his account at

Oakland is not a war zone. Nor
is it a tranquil little town in
northern Vermont where all the
natives are in bed by S8 p.m. and
there hasn’t been a robbery or
mugging since the American
Revolution.

That is why, if you’re smart,
you’ll take a few safety
precautions when out and about
in Oakland. The following tips
have been provided courtesy of
Officer Vernon Barkley of the Pitt
Department of Public Safety.

Don’t go out at night by
yourself. That’s as basic as your
mother's old advice, “Don’t take
candy from strangers." Surely you
freshmen haven’t forgotten her
advice, at least not yet. When it
comes to safety, it’s wise to listen
to your mother, because if anyone
‘ cares aboutyour safety, she does.

Know your campus. Pitt and
surrounding Oakland can be
confusing at night, especially to

freshmen who often get lost even «

 

yourself with the locations of
emergency phones on campus
so you know where they are
when you need them. There are
over 100 such phones in Oakland.

It's also helpful to know the
schedules and routes of the
‘campus bus and shuttle. Instead
of walking through Oakland at
night, it is often more convenient
to ride. It beats taking your
chances, and you ’ve already paid
for the service when you paid
your tuition bill.

Don’t use a MAC machine in an
isolated area after dark.

“Crime happens because
students present an opportunity
for it to happen,” says Barkley.
Being alone at an isolated
machine makes such an
opportunity.

Also, “Be aware of con artists,”
he says. For example: Be wary of
people coming up‘ to you posing
as foreigners and asking you how
to operate a MAC machine. If you

your own money, you’re asking
for trouble.

"Don’t wear your backpack
draped over one shoulder,” says
Barkley. “Put it on the right way.”
It's harder for a thief to grab your
backpack and run away with it
when it’s strapped to both
shoulders.

Always keep your wallet and
keys in your pocket — never in
your backpack or purse. That
way if the backpack or purse is
stolen, all the thief got are your
books, makeup, walkman, etc.
And who needs those things,

anyway?

At least you’ll be left with your‘

Pitt I.D. to get into the dorms,
your keys to unlock your door,

and your MAC card to withdraw ‘

money to buy new books and a

 

um PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, August 30, 1989

Speaking of books and
backpacks: Never leave them
unattended in Hillman Library.
When you return, you might find
you have nothing left to study.

Barkley recommends that all
students have their valuables
engraved to guard against theft in
their dorm or apartment. Pitt's
Public Safety department calls
this safeguard “Project
Identification.” Call the
department for more information.

“Please pay attention when
crossing Fifth Avenue,” says
Barkley. Fifth Avenue is one-way
for automobile traffic, but PAT
buses use the lane closest to the
Towers, and they run against the
regular traffic lanes.

They shoot down the lane
quickly, and their horns aren’t
very loud, so be very careful. But
if you’re not, it won't be the first
time someone has been run over.

Again, freshmen, remember
what your mother used to say:

Pitt's political groups poised for action

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

College campuses have had a
reputation for being political
hotbeds ever since the radical
protests of the 1960s.. While Pitt’s
chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society is no longer
meeting, the mainstream political
groups, namely the College
Young Democrats and the College
Republicans, are still going strong.

“Our platform will most likely
come from the national party,
[since] Republicans do not fall far
from party ideology,” said College
Republican affiliate Daryl Grecich.

Due to the collaboration of
acting president Tara Fedo and
Grecich, the College Republicans
are in the process of being
reorganized. Last year, Grecich
started Students for George Bush
because he was dissatisfied with
the organization of the College
Republicans at that time.

“We are in sort of an interim
stage right now,” said Grecich.
“Our strategy will be similar to
what we did last year, although
there is now no presidential
election in progress.”

One plan of the organization is
to campaign for District 8
Republican city council candidate
Mary Caroline Hunt If elected,
Hunt will be the first Republican
on city council. since the 19305.
District 8 includes Shadyside,
Bloomfield and parts of Oakland.

The College Republicans also
had a booth at the Freshman
Activities Fair, which stressed
voter registration and passed out
ﬂyers to boost the number of
recruits.

“Our main goals right now are
to recruit new members and have
an election [for group officersl,”
said Grecich. “We will make the
organization strong, and plan by
the middle of September to be
very active as a whole.” The

election for officers will be held
in early September.

Grecich said that the group has
no plans to take a stand on
abortion unless necessary: “If the
organization chooses to take a
stand on the abortion’ issue, [it]
will do so later on. No position is
planned right now.”

In addition to accenting
Republican issues such as ethics,
family values, less bureaucracy
and less governmental spending,
the group will schedule various
Republican speakers to lecture

throughout the year in Pittsburgh.

On the opposite side of the
political spectrum, the College
Young Democrats will begin the
new school year with Jeff
Wisniewski as president, Terry
Lee as vice president, Chris Bondi
as secretary and George Prokop
as treasurer.

An initial plan of Wisniewski’s
was having a booth at the
Activities Fair. The Democratic
group initiated pro—choice
petitions to be sent to the Senate
in Washington, D.C. ‘

The group is supporting the
National Organization for Women
rally to be held in Harrisburg on
Sept. 26.

“[Abortionl is an explosive issue

right now,” said Wisniewski. .

“We’re going to try to do all we
can.”

The College Young Democrats
are planning to support District 8
city council Democratic candidate
Dan Cohen.

“There is a viable Republican
candidate in District 8 to contend

ROTC

Continued from page 1
once in a semester.

Students may take military
science courses for up to two
years with no obligation to serve
in the armed forces, unless they
accept an ROTC scholarship.

“The program gives to the
freshmen a lot more than they
give to us,” Horoho said.

Students may apply for two—or
three—year ROTC scholarships at

the end of their freshman or
sophomore year. According to
Horoho, a student must have an
overall GPA of 2.5 or greater,
pass a physical and go for a
review before the ROTC
Scholarship Board to be eligible
for an ROTC scholarship. _
An ROTC scholarship will pay
each student up to $7,000, or 80
percent of the school’s tuition

’ cost. Horoho said that covers the

full tuition cost at Pitt. Each
student also receives a $100-per—
month stipend and $395 per year
for books and other school
supplies.

Students who graduate from
the ROTC program become
commissioned officers, either on
active duty or in the National
Guard or Reserve.

“The No. 1 beneﬁt is the
commission. It's very valuable;

not everyone can get a U.S. Army
commission," said Cadet Andy
Miscuk, a Pitt senior.

He added, “There’s a challenge
involved; it’s not easy. You get
out of it what you put into it.”

Horoho said that his goal this
year is to get 100 incorrling
freshmen to participate in the
program.

With $2 a day and an I.D.,
students, faculty and staff can get
a permit for the Trees Hall and
Panther Hollow lots. However,
cars must get there early to be
assured a spot, and spaces left
during the day might not be

available upon returning. In a

100—space lot, about 118 will be
sold under the assumption that
some people won’t come in every

in the lot is the only way to
guarantee getting a parking space.

Parking permits are also
available for evening students,
and because there is less
competition for spaces, there is

I more choice of parking lots in the

evening.

Another option is car pooling.

“Car pooling is great for those
who don’t have a car and those

a who do, but want to take others

truly a sign of the times," he said.

Shawn Williams, rush chairman
for ZBT, said that he thinks that
eliminating pledging will help
improve the Greek image overall.

“I notice an antifraternal

. sentiment [on campus], and I hate

to see the Greek system seen as
negative. This can only improve
our image."

Williams admitted that he was
skeptical when he heard about
the plan from the national chapter,
but said that he liked the idea
after it was formally presented to
him.

“Pledging creates fear through
intimidation," said Williams. “This
way, you get rid of the whole
fear. It’s going to open up barriers
between the new and old

  

brothers. _

“Pledging has the effect of
forming a small clique within the
fraternity. It’s not healthy."

Williams also noted that high
insurance liabilities were a factor
in the decision to eliminate
pledging.

“The rates are getting so high
that I think every fraternity will
have to do this within the next

five or six years,” he said.

The members of the Pitt ZBT
chapter’s last pledge class also
like the idea.

According to Ken Kelman, “This
gets the brothers more involved
with the process. It’s great.”

JeffRosenthal, another member
of the last pledge class, said,
“[Pledging] was frightening. You
never new what to expect. This is

a better plan.”

Though they are enthusiastic
about the idea, the brothers admit
that they will have to look at
potential brothers more carefully.

“When you have pledging, you
have the option to get rid of
someone if they don’t cut it,"
Williams said. “Now, all of the
brothers have to be involved, to
make sure that this works.”

Also in the new plan are

dealt with accordingly.

Neuman. “This way we will get

Campus Police should

not just stand and Watch

What exactly is a “potential for trouble”?

According to Bill Brennan, director of Public Safety, it is
possible that returning Pitt students may conﬂict with
young Pittsburgh residents who have claimed Oakland
during the summer._

Brennan’s choice of words seems slightly optimistic.

Isn’t it natural. that conflict would happen? Don’t animals
battle for territorial rights? It should be obvious that some
conﬂicts will occur l— C no matter how aware of that
‘_‘potential” we are. ,

_ For those who can remember September of 1986, when
over 100 youths jumped on top of cars and passers-by
wereassaulted, the potential is a reality. How many cars
must be stolen and apartments broken into before this is
seen as a real problem — and dealt with as such?

Nevertheless, Brennan feels that he has the situation
under control. He, would like Pitt students and Pittsburgh
youths to be one big happy family. Brennan plans "to
accomplish this by implementing interactive programs

«<2. and comrnunity awareness days that are sure to make

everybodythe best of friends. ,
Isn’t it naive to think that a few committees and

programs will put an end to the friction and resentment ’

that has built up over the years? ,

Pitt students are tired of being afraid to walk alone down
Forbes Avenue at night. Whether or not this fear is
warranted, to them Oakland is home — and‘ no one
should be afraid to walk two blocks down the street in his

hometown.

I But never fear, Brennan plans to have plenty of Campus
Police on hand to take care of any problems that do arise...

gjust like they have in the past.

It is time that the Campus Police take this situation
seriously. Instead of hanging around the Original Hot
Dog Shop or other problem areas, wouldn’t it be better to

- deal with the matter directly? If anyone is caught commit-

ting a crime then he needs to be punished to the fullest
extent possible; It is not enough for the Campus Police to
be present, but to be ready and willing to make arrests if
possible. A slap on the wrist just doesn’t seem to be doing
the job. "

Dan I Quayle...

Many presidents have made
Cabinet picks and other appoint-
ments that have come back to
haunt them. President Reagan’s

Secretary of State Don Regan

hopped on the “bookwagon”
after leaving his position and

humiliated the Reagans with his P
. remarks about Nancy’s fascina-

tion with astrology. ThelCarter

White House was assailed by its
own party for the former presi-
dent's choice of National Secu-
rity Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski
—— a Soviet skeptic and realist
who wasn’t as willing to trust
Brezhnev as many of Carter’s
Democratic supporters were.
And President Truman, pain-
fully recalling one of his Su-
preme Court appointees, Justice
Tom C. Clark, commented, “It
isn’t so much that he’s a bad
man. It’s just that he’s such a
dumb son of a b-tch. He’s about
the dumbest man I think I’ve
ever run across.”

With th-is in mind, and despite
shots from both parties, why
has President Bush’s confidence
in Vice President Dan Quayle
continued to ﬂourish?

That question was on the
minds of many who tuned into
an Aug. 24 broadcast of P71‘-
metime Live — the latest “we
pay our co-hosts more than the

other networks pay theirs” TV
news magazine featuring the
semantically pugnacious Sam
Donaldson and Diane Sawyer.

I hoped that Donaldson or
Sawyer could unveil the reason-
ing behind Bush’s confidence in
Quayle, perhaps by means of a
question pertaining to the V.P.’s
assessment of what Bush means
by’ “beyond containment.”
(Quayle- once explained it as
“the peaceful liberation of the
peoples of Central and Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union
from communism.) Or maybe‘:
he could share his doubts about
the plans for free elections in
Nicaragua in February of 1990:

_ “A sham [dictated bythe‘ anti-,_

democratic] axis of Cuba, Nica-
ragua and Panama.” Or perhaps
a comment about Gorbachev,
whom he distrusts: “Just remem-
ber what Lenin said. To advance
communism, every once in a
while you take one step back-
ward and then you move two
steps forward.  [Gorbachev’sl
got inherent conflicts. On the,
one hand he says he’s a Leninist.
On the the other, he says he’s
for democratization. You can't
have both. I surmise that he’s as
dedicated a Leninist as he says
he is.’? Or maybe a summary of
the 20-year space agenda which
he has collaborated on as chair-
man of Bush’s Space Council.
Or his adamant support of the
Strategic Defense Initiative. Or
the capital gains tax proposals.
Nope.

Instead, Donaldson and Saw-
yer asked questions representa-
tive of the great thinkers who
have roamed this earth, such as:
Why the jokes? Why do they
make fun of you so much? Have
you i changed because of the
jokes? What about your occa-
sional malapropisrns? And how
does Mr. Quayle feel about being
the center of jokes on the night-
time TV monologues of such
great modern-day political theo-

the American. media

Has the media given a chance?

V rists as Jay Leno,,Johnny Carson’

and David Letterman. (Yawn.)

I’d provide an actual text of the ‘

questions, but.I’ve never been

an advocate of pollution —/- get
' the idea? ' C

Donaldson did touch on some
very ambiguous domestic issues,

one being U.S. diplomat—Soviet .
spy, Felix Bloch. On the latter, I

Quayle stated that the way the
press has hounded Bl ,:h made‘
.ok silly,

which it does, and i

tell them to stop it— ' itas V.P~.
he wouldn’t. T. which
Donaldson showed 1.. respect
for the "next-to-the-highest,man.
of the leading country in the
free world by arrogantly and
ostentatiously barking back,
“You're darn right you wouldn’t!”

As the interview? drew to a
end, along with the intelligence
of the American media, Sawyer
finished the bloodletting with
this indifferent gem: “Former
[Carter] V.P. Walter Mondale rates
your performance thus far with
a ‘C’ grade. How do you feel
about that?” We know how
Quayle would have liked to

answer .— maybe, ‘Mondalel

Ha! — that loser? Well, I give
him an ‘F’ as a V.P. and an ‘F’ as
a presidential candidate!” But
instead, he kept his cool with an
answer that should satisfy the
country’s eggheads and give
them something to laugh about
at work the next day; “That's
better than any of the gradesl
received in college."

I’m forced to conclude from
interviews such as this that it
isn’t Mr. Quayle who is dumb,

but certain members of they ”
American media —— the people

who have led us to believe that
Quayle is dumb.

Women netters seek
repeat in Big East

By Chris Kuzneski
For The Pitt News

The Lady Panther volleyball
team is coming off its fourth Big
East Tournament title since 1982,
and under the leadershipof first-
year coach Sue Woodstra, this
year’s squad has the potential to
establish Pitt as a national power.

In order to
achieve a lofty
ranking, how-
ever, Woodstra
needs to fill the
void left by
1988 Big East
T ou rna me nt
MVP Denise
Frawley and
f o u r - y e a r
starter Nora
Mulvihill, both
of whom graduated last year.
Woodstra, , however, isn’t too
concerned about the losses and
feels that teamwork will be the
key to this year’s squad. V

“I’m looking for everyone to
contribute evenly, and I want it to
be a complete team effort,” said
Woodstra. “I expect full effort
from the top players as well as
the 12th member of the squad,
and if that happens, we’ll be
successful.”

1 Despite the losses of Frawley
and Mulvihill," Pitt returns four
starters and 12 letter—winners from

last year’s 24-9 squad. The top
returning players include senior
Kelly Matheis (outside hitter),
senior’ Julie Sheils (outside hit-
ter), senior Lori Silk (setter), jun-
iors Michele Adamson (middle
blocker) and Jenelle Lantagne
(setter), and sophomore Deidre
MacAulay (middle blocker).
Even though none of these
players
achieved
superstar status
yet, Woodstra
feels each of
her players
_ stands out in
her own way.
“I see Julie
Sheils as stand-
ing outbecause
. she hits very
hard, and that
is what people like watching most.
I seeJenelle Lantagne as standing
out. She’s setting well, and she
runs the offense,” said Woodstra.
“I notice Deidre MacAulay, who
can play defense and pass. It's
tough to tell who will be the star
of the team." A
One of the big concerns that

the Lady Panthers must face is their

departure of head coach Shelton
Collier, who accepted a position
with the U.S. Olympic team.
Woodstra, however, feels that the
team will not suffer.

J‘ Staff Writer

Darnell Dickerson’s shocking early
season departure from the Pitt football
team is not the only major absentee
development that head coach Mike
Gottfriedlwill have to face as he prepares
for Saturday’s season opener against
Paciﬁc.

Several players from last season have
quit the team, including Calvert Jones,
who would have been the starting right
tackle had he remained in preseason
camp at Johnstown.

:4 Tight end-turned—backup-quarterback

Bill T urkowski, freshman linebacker Mike
'Ihoreson and freshman defensive end

Bob Dunwiddie also left Pitt’s preseason
training site.

Jones’ absence will probably give
Gottfried the biggest headache. A few
days before he announced that he was
no longer interested in playing college
football, the 6-foot—S, 270—pound re-
dshirt freshman called it an “honor” to be

starting at a major Division I school at

such an early age. Vfrth injuries toBill
Cherpak and Dan Anderson taken into
consideration, a position once thought to
be a major strength of Pitt’s '89 squad
now looks to be the most questionable.

T urkowski moved into the tight end
position after transferring from the Uni-
versity of Miami, where he backed up

Vinnie T estaverde and Steve Walsh, prior
to the 1987 season. But when the top two
Panther signal-callers left —— Dickerson
and last year’s No. 2 QB Larry Wanke
(who has since moved on to John Carrol)
-—-— Pitt found itself scrambling for players
capable of throwing the ball, and gave
Turkowski a chance to move into his old
spot on the ﬁeld.

But the switch apparently did not work
out, and soon after T urkoski was put
onto the scout team at Johnstown, he
announced that he was finished with his
organized football career.

Meanwhile, four of Gottfried’s recent ,

recruits have been lost due to academic

problems.

Leading that list is quarterback Gary
Clayton, considered one of the top 10
players to come out of Alabama. The
Educational Testing Service, which sanc-
tions the SAT and ACT, refused on Friday
to validate Clayton’s test results when he
scored 1050 on the SAT and improved 10
points on a retest of the ACT. His much-
publicized situation came to a thudding
conclusion when it was announced that
Clayton would attend Navarro Junior
College in Corsicana, Texas.

Editor’s Note: This is part one o
a two-partseries by'I'he Pitt News
assistant sports editor describing
his summer internship.

This summer, I had the unique

’ 99 opportunity to serve as an intern

for the United States Olympic,

’ Committee at the Olympic Train-

ing Center in Colorado Springs,
Colo., for nine weeks.
For the first two weeks, I
worked for the Miller High Life
 Bureau, an organization
sponsored by the Miller Brewing
Company. Our main purpose
was to give orientations to in-

coming athletic camps, explain-
ing the USOC and the Training
Center, and subsequently writing
press ‘releases about the athletes
and coaches who came to attend
these training camps.

The Colorado Springs facility is
the headquarters for most na-
tional governing bodies of the
amateur sports federations which
compete in the summer Olyrr.-
pics. Sports ranging from arch-
ery and basketball to tae-kwon-
do and table tennis operate di-
rectly out of Colorado Springs.

Like most naive tourists, I
expected to meet such superstars

as Carl Lewis, Florence Grifﬁth-
Joyner and maybe a few mem-
bers of the 1988 gold—medal vol-
leyball team. However, my en-

thusiasm was quickly stifled as I
learned the truth about the pur-
pose of the Training Center.
The national governing bodies
for each sport are responsible for
selecting elite atbletw at the col-
legiate and high school level and
bringing them to Colorado Springs

in order to train -and further
develop their skills in either indi-
vidual sports or team competi-
tions. Thus, the Colorado Springs
Training Center is a breeding
ground for future Olympians.

Because I worked during a
summer three years before the
next Olympics, I probably will
never know how many, if any,
Olympians were on complex
during my internship.

However, I had the privilege of
covering different events which
took place at the Training Center,
and as a result, I met some very
interesting and well-known ath-

athletes many traininghours

letes. , I

I covered a basketball game
between the United States and
Canada which was a prelude to
the World Qualiﬁcation Tourna-
ment in Mexico City earlier this
summer. Pitt’s own three-point
ace, Jason Matthews, was a
member of the team and wound
up with the highest overall three-
poiht percentage, posting a .545
mark. - In addition to postgame
interviews with Matthews, I was
able to talk to Duke University's
Christian Laettner, North Caro-
lina State's premier point guard

Bucs' official scorer steals time between Pirates, Pitt

By Chris Kuzneski
For The Pitt News

During any big league baseball 0

game, there are many decisions
that must be made. A manager
must decide whether his players
should bunt‘ or steal. Umpires
must quickly decide whether a

baserunner is safe or out, and

fans must decide when to wait in

the long restroom lines.

Evan Pattak, however, doesn't
sympathize with any of the afore—
mentioned situations because
decisions are his life. Pattak is the
Pittsburgh Pirates official scorer,
and his only responsibility is
making a firm decision and stand-
ing by it. Pattak is also on the
University of Pittsburgh publica-
tions board.

His decisions seem simple

which pitcher should be awarded
a victory.

innings, three calls were contro-
versial, and any of the scorer’s

decisions could have stopped the .

no-hit bid. In each case, how-
ever, the scorer ruled against
possible hits, and was booed
loudly on each occasion.

The biggest controversy of
Pattak’s career, however, was
during a game against the Chi-
cago Cubs.

“A few years ago, Omar Moreno
of the Pirates was leading the

league in stolen bases, ” explained.

Pattak. “During a game between
the Pirates and Cubs, Moreno
easily stole second base, not even
drawing a throw from the catcher.

“I assumed it was an easy call,

I and I gave Omar the base. After I

the game, however, a representa~
tive of .the Cubs claimed that if a
defensive team is indifferent to a
stolen, base, then no stolen base
should be awarded. Well, I ar-
gued that the first baseman tried

‘to keep Moreno near first, and

the pitcher pitched from the
stretch, so I decided the Cubs
weren’t indifferent; therefore, I
awarded the stolen base.”

What Pattak didn’t anticipate
however, was the controversy
that was to follow.

“The Pirates had completed

their season,” he continued, “and I

Moreno was leading the league
in steals by only one base, my
base. The player in second place
was Ron LeFlore of the Expos,
and he had one game remaining

« to make up my controversial base.

LeFlore, however, was hurt, and
wasn't scheduled to play. So, I’m
thinking, my decision made the
difference in the title. As it turns
out, LeFlore played hurt, stole
two bases, and beat Moreno,
letting me off the hook.”

  W/oodstra brings West Coast experience to volleyball team

THE Pl'l'I' NEWS, Wednesday, August 30, 1989

By  Kumeski
For The Pitt News

In 1980, the University of Pitts-
burgh hired Shelton Collier to be
the head coach of the women's
volleyball team. Over the past
nine seasons, Collier has helped
establish Pitt as a volleyball power
in the East, compiling a 296-93
record.

Collier, however, resigned last
season to accept a position with
the U.S. Olympic volleyball team.
Now under the leadership of first-
year head coach Sue» Woodstra,
the Lady Panthers hope to con-
tinue their rise to national promi-
nence. ' I

   

on a powerful University of
Southern California squad. In
1977, she was a member of USC’s
National Championship team, the
only team in NCAA history to go

defensive player. She managed
to top that great honor in 1979
and 1980, when she was awarded
the Miskasa Award, an award that
honors the nation’s top all-around
player.

After establishing herself as one_
of the best volleyball players in
the world, Woodstra was selected
for the 1980 U.S. Olympic squad.
Unfortunately, the United States
boycotted the Moscow Games,
and Woodstra was unable to
participate. In 1984, however, she
achieved her top honor by being
selected as captain of the silver

“ medal—winning volleyball team.

Woodstra feels her Olympic
experience greatly enhanced her

Woodstra. “I learned how to set a
goal and take steps to get there,
and that's one of the most impor-
tant lessons I've learned. I can
use that now. I don't have the
same goals, but I still have goals.
Now I know how to form things
to get there.” .

Following the 1984 Olympic
games, she served as a player/
coach on the post-Olympic U.S.
Nationa_l Team that toured Korea,

~ Singapore and Hong Kong. She

also participated in the World
Championships in 1974, 1978 and

11

1982, as well as the 1981 World
Cup. Overall, «she has competed
in more than 20 foreign coun-
tries. 2

After ﬁnishing her stint on the
U.S. National Team, Woodstra
split her time coaching at Arizona
State and playing professionally

in Japan, which she greatly en-

joyed. ,
“The fans in Japan are real
fanatics. We would play in front
of at least 2,000 to 8,000 people
a night,” said Woodstra.

Even though she has racked up
many frequent flyer miles over
the past few years, Woodstra
claims she is very happy at Pitt.

“I plan on staying at Pitt for a

I while, and I hope to make this a

better team. Volleyball, in the
East, is very undeveloped, and it
could really blossom out here. I
think it is exciting to be at a place

in this stage. I hope to be in on
the growth, and help that hap-
pen,” said Woodstra.

If the success that Woodstra
has achieved during her illustri-
ous volleyball career is any indi-
cation of the direction that the

program is headed in, then the

Lady Panthers should prepare
themselves for a rise to national
preeminence.

Chris Corchiani, and Syracuse’s
own phenom, Billy Owens.

What was most interesting
about these athletes was the fact
that everyone seemed to forget
about college basketball’s rules
and rivalries, and concentrated
instead on playing the best inter-
national basketball possible.
International ball has a 24-sec-
ond clock, a 21-foot three—point
line, and a rule in which the
referee does not have to touch
the ball on a turnover.

All of these athletes seemed to
like international rules much
better, and N.C. State’s Corchiani
summed up why. “College ball is

more of a cut-and-pass and pa-l

tience kind of a game. In interna-
tional basketball, it’s like the team
with the best athletes who can
tolerate and endure running up
and down the court the most will.
win. I think everyone here really

enjoys that type of game, ” Corchi-

ani said.

I also had the opportunity to
cover the Pan American Wres-
tling Championshipsz. an intema-
tional competition featuring the
best wrestlers in both the frees-
tyle and Greco-Roman divisions
from all over the globe. I had the
opportunity to meet 1988 Olym-
pic bronzemedalist Nate Carr, as
well as Jim and Bill Scherr, also
1988 Olympians.

As far as the internship duties
went, the information for each
athlete’s or coach’s press release
was drawn from questionnaires
handed to them at the end of
each orientation session. The

releases were sent to hometown’

newspapers which the athletes/
coaches requested.

Typing and organizing the re-
leases was simply a matter of
getting used to an IBM computer,
and after about ﬁve days, the
process became a whiz. I began

to think that the most interesting
part of my internship was the
events I covered which had noth-
ing to do with the organization I
was working for. I started to
think that I could become bored
with this standard process of
writing press releases extremely
quickly.

' However, quite by chance, the
Miller Brewing Company with-
drew its ﬁnancial support from
the Training Center, and as a
result, our bureau became de-
funct.

The reason for this twist of fate
was simple. The contract for
Miller Brewing was up, and the
USOC decided to open up the
bidding to multiple corporate
sponsors, awarding the right of
sponsorship to more than one
company. Thus, Miller ‘Brewing
could no longer say it was the
sole sponsorof the Training Cen-
ter, and thus withdrew its sup-
port and its future bidding.

Inside sources have said that
Miller Brewing was receiving
various protests from different
groups who did not like the fact
that a beer company was the
sponsor of a facility which repre-
sented the pinnacle of athletic
achievement. A

Regardless of the reason, I was I

out of a job for only one day; as
the USOC’s department. of Public
Information and Media Relations

‘took me onas an intern. This job

was to fill the rest of my summer
and it turned out to be a com-
pletely different experience than

-Another challenge the team will
have to overcome is ‘a schedule
that includes many’ top 20 teams.
Traditional volleyball power-
houses Arizona, Arizona State,
Pacific and Stanford are only a
few of the quality teams that the
Lady Panthers will face.

“We have a tough schedule,
but I know we’ll do OK. If we
upset some teams already in the
top 20, I think we'll work in

there,” said Woodstra. “The key _

is to get established in the top _20
then work to stay there.”

Donovan's responsibility to
change into his “sportswriting

his own controversial call. Need-

touchy at best." I

Shortly after that incident, the
league decided that official scor-

league duties. It was after this
ruling that Pattak applied for the
Pirates’ job.

Pattak claims he has always
had an interest in sports, and he
even worked brieﬂy as a sports-

obtaining the position of associ-

Many years later, Pattak still
