Professors

To Receive
Evaluation

Undergraduate liberal arts pro-
fessors who indicated a desire to
have their students evaluate them
will soon receive the results, ac-
cording to Mrs. Madelaine H.
Apt, research assistant to Dr.

 George Fahey, "professor of ,psy-

Q" adjectives and the impact of the‘

chology, and Dr. Seth Spaulding,
associate professor of education.
This research project, a small
part of Dr. Fahey’s continuous
attempt to improve classroom
instruction, add information to
the theory of teaching. It allows
-the teacher to know his impact
on the class andimprove his in-
struction. The results are conﬁ-
dential and do not affect a stu-
dent’s grade.
The student reaction to teach-

~ ing is only one aspect of the pro-
” cess; the others are the opinion

of colleagues, and_ the adminis-
tration, _and the teacher’s pub-
lished works. Mrs. Apt believes
that the “student is most impor-
tant in the whole process of edu-
cation.”

The questionnaire is a portion
of the Osgood Semantic Differ-
ential which iMrs. Apt subjected
to experimentation. That scale’s

tonyms. The 12 pairs of adjec-
tives used in Mrs. Apt’s rating
scale chosen from 456 experimen-
tal cases. “These adjectives are
those -most dominant in factors I
have' isolated in teaching beha-

? vior,” Mrs. Apt said.

Behavior is described in terms
of these adjectives. The idea is
to have the~students deﬁne these

instructor on them. The degree
of intensity is reported by a num-
erical scale. ‘.

The second part of the scale,
consisting of 13 adjectives, is
more meaningful since the terms
are more commonplace. Part
three is more ﬂexible than one
and two because it lets the stu-
dent communicate his own eval-
uation. '

_ After all three parts were com-

1

 

pleted by students, Mrs. Apt ﬁled
the evaluations without opening
them until the end of the fall
trimester. She then subjected the
results to a process of statistical
design _ called factor analysis
which seeks the minimum num-
ber of correlations between any
number of results will be put on
IBM cards, processed and /given
to the ~participating professors.
This process will be continued
this trimester and the results of
the two evaluations will be com-

 pared and studied.

The University’s chemical engineering curriculum has ii,

been fully accredited by the Penna. Registration 
for Professional Engineers. The Board's action permit

 

chemical engineering graduates to obtain a professional en.-_ ,
gineer’s license in Pennsylvania without taking- the Ell
gineer-In-Training (EIT) exam usually required ‘of gradu‘

ates of non-accredited schools.
Dr. Edward B. Stuart, chair-
man of the chemical engineering
department, delivered what he
termed the “pleasant news” at
yesterday’s engineering seminar.
He explained that the State Board
was made aware of the depart-

ment’s loss of accreditation by‘
. the Engineers’ Council for Profes-

sional Development (ECPD) last
year and that Michael Baker, J r},
president of the Board wrote_Dec.
29,, notifying the department of
the ‘Board's action.

The State Board normally uses

the ECPD accreditation as its

criterion in accrediting schools.
“Since the ECPD decision was

not favorable, the Board took its‘

own stand,” Stuart explained. He
said that to his knowledge there
wasno limit to the period of
time for which the accreditation

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

After what has been a dis-
appointing holiday recess,
the Panther basketball team
(3-6) face Virginia Tech in
an away encounter tomorrow
night.

Tech (8-2) is one of the most
powerful independents in the
South. They are undefeated in
four games at home and have
beaten highly rated Wichita and
Texas A&M teams on the road.
Only number one ranked Duke
and Oklahoma City managed“vic-
tories over VPI, both games were

away.

 

Another Tech, this one located
in Georgia, proved to be too much
for the hoopsters last Tuesday
evening in Atlanta. The Ramb-
ling Wrecks used the 15 point
spot that any visiting team must
give when playing in Dixie to
topple the.Panthers, 89-77.

The pattern in the. Georgia
Tech game followed the script

Mat Season
Begins Sat.

’The wrestling rebuilding

A program of new_ coach Dave

Johnson receives its first
test tomorrow when the
matmen open their season at
Temple.

Physically‘ the wrestlers will‘

be in good shape with both Claire
Riley and Rick Shildt recovered
from broken hands. The squad,
however, will be an inexperi-
enced one ,with at least eight

: sophomores» in the line-up.

“Temple’s the type of team we
should be able to beat,” said
Johnson. “But“this team still has
a long way to go before it reach-
es the level it was at several
years ago.” 7‘

Last year, the biggest handicap
for the 4-6 squad was in the up-
per weight divisions. Sophomore
Jack Williams (191) and Terry

‘ Hoover in the heavyweight cate-

gory should help to alleviate the
problem this year. t ’

“Williams and Hoover should t

be able to help us “out, but they’re
inexperiencedpright now. After a
few meets _they should be com-
ing through,” said Johnson.

Promise No Relief For Panthers

that was written during the pre-
vious week against the Ivy
League competition. The hoops-
ters stayed close, e.ven moved
ahead at one point, 55-54, but
couldn’t win it.

In the opening round of the
Kodak Classic, Columbia had led
at the half -by nine, 30-21. The
Panthers closed the gap to ﬁve
but never could do better, losing,
65-59. Stan Falenski led the

hoopsters with 11. points while»,

7-1 Dave Newmark (who was to
win the tourney MVP) scored
17 for Columbia. ‘

SWIMMING MEET

morrow at Trees Pool at 2 p.m.
Coach Ben Grady’s swimmers
seek their ﬁrst win after open-
ing losses to Michigan State
and North Carolina State. Last

, year, Maryland won, 62-33.

 

and a third place, 69-65. The win
broke a three game losing streak
to the trio of Cornell, Penn, and
Columbia. The Panthers weren't
up .to the Ivy League standards.

Penn beat the hoopsters, 75-65,
in a closer battle than the ex-
perts had ﬁgured. Cornell broke
open a 50-50 tie ball game in the
last ten minutes to win, 81-72.
The apparent bright spot in the
losses was the emergence of Fal-
enski as a consistent scorer. He
paced the Panthers with 18 points
against Cornell.

What does it take to “spark” a man to his "very
best . . . to bring out the fullest expression of his
ability and training? At Ford Motor Company
we are __convinced that an invigorating business
and professional climate is one essential. A prime
ingredient of this climate is the stimulation that
comes from working with the top people in a
ﬁeld . . . such as Dr. James Mercereau.

Jim Mercereau joined our Scientiﬁc Laboratory
in 1962. Recently, he headed a team of physicists
who veriﬁed aspects of the Quantum Theory by
creating’ a giant, observable quantum elfect in
superconductors. This outstanding achievement

ing to almost certain death un-

Oranaselor other drugs.

., The insulin usually given to
diabetic patients comes from
sheep, cattle or pigs. Laboratory-
made insulin is more costly than
insulin obtained from animals.
 Radioactive-tagged insulin will,
for example, enable scientists to
tract: the path of insulin through
thebodies of healthy and diabetic

fails to function because it is des-
royed inside the body by some
 enzyme, is blocked by some other
substance, or is somehow imper-
fect to start with.

. The commercial production of
artiﬁcial insulin may someday be
necessary because diabetes is in-
creasing and supplies of natural
pinsuliri‘ are limited.
