reacts to
O'Connor
resigning

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

J. Dennis O’Connor’s four-
year term as Pitt Chancellor is
over and the mood surrounding
his departure is one of disap-
pointment, but guarded opti-
rrrism for the future.

“I hope that we can pull
together during the next year [to
make sure that the university
runs well and prospers,” said
Pitt Provost James Maher at
Monday’s Senate Council
meeting.

Professor and Senate Council
pro-tempore Richard Tobias,
who rejoined the Senate after
quitting in the wake of
O’Connor’s decision to phase
out HealthAmerica last month,
said there is still a lot of deci-
sidns to make. 0 .

“‘It will be a difﬁcult time for
the university,” Tobias said.
“This won’t make things easy.”

Senate Council President
James Holland said although
O’Connor did his best to
advance the cause of the uni-
versity, there was a “loss of
confidence by the [board of]
trustees.” L

“I think it is an important step
for the university. I approve of
it,” said Holland, who was also
angry with the HealthAmerica
decision. ,

Last month, O’Connor elimi-
nated HealthAmerica as a
health care option for Pitt
employees, leaving Blue Cross
as the sole health care provider.
The decision was made despite

statement.

Pitt Chancellor J . Dennis O’Connor’s resigna-
tion has left the university searching for a leader
as it seeks its role for the 21st century.

“The primary challenge facing the [board of
trustees] is to ﬁnd an experienced leader who has
the imagination and vision to move the universi-
ty forward in the midst of a dramatically chang-
ing environment,” said J .W. Connolly, chair des-
ignate of the board of trustees,,in a prepared

“I plan to seek input from people within and
outside the university to determine the qualities
they believe are essential in a new chancellor. In

the near future, we will appoint a search commit-
tee to select that individual,” he said.

Who the next chancellor will be is a concern
to many in the university.

University Senate President James Holland,
said Pitt needs a chancellor who will work with
the constituents of the university as well as
devote himself to a high level of serious college

education.

“I think somebody that can work to get align-
ment with the faculty and work with them, align-
ment with the staff and work with them  same
thing with the board of trustees.”

Holland said O’Connor had principles of aca-
demic vision, “but he didn’t work well with peo-

“Tower “C will remain open,
Lothrop will close. They will
then upgrade Tower C by using

the equipment from Lothrop,“

Berger said.

“Also, Eddie’s or Schenley
will fully remain open late night,
until eleven o’clock. They have
not decided yet which one,” she
added.

T herewill also be nutritionists
and nutritionist interns coming
in from the School of Nursing
and possibly the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center to
analyze the nutritional value of
some of the foods. .

It will also be a requirement
for resident students to buy
blocks next year, no exceptions.

“The thing is, it’s going to be

to contin ue as is next year

cheaper. to buy with choice dol-
lars, ‘but resident students have
to buy BLOCKS,” said Berger.

The reason for requiring resi-
dent students to buy BLOCKS is
that the Department of Food
Services has to incur the loss
that they suffered the past few
years.

“Basically, they’ve got to
break even and the students are
paying for it,” stated Berger.

. SGB member John Callahan
discussed the proposed plan to
move the resident assistants in
Sutherland Hall into the current
study lounges.

“They’re taking the RAs from
their double rooms and going to
put them in one of the study
lounges per ﬂoor, except for the
second ﬂoor,” said Callahan.

Vanda/ism
of all sorts :
takes its
toll on the
pocketbook

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor ‘ ’

(Editor’s note: This is the
second part of a three-part
series on vandalism at the
University of Pittsburgh. )

If you can read the writing
on the wall, it says, “You’re
paying for this.”

On an urban campus, van-
dalism may seem harmless
but clean-up costs are not.

Graffiti of all sorts must be
cleaned up and those that do
it are the 10 members of the
Pitt Paint Shop, according to
Curt Graham, director of
operations and maintenance
for Pitt’s Department of
Facilities Management.

Currently, it takes about 45
hours and $1,300 a month to
take care of vandalism,
according to Manager of
Trades Robert Boyce. That
adds up to over $15,000 a
year and 13 work weeks
spent on graffiti removal.

“Kids don’t realize ‘that
when they do this or_ steal
that, that’s their money. You
don’t see it when you sign
your check to pay for your
credits and your tuition, but

~~~somebody’s paying for it,”

Boyce said.

These figures do not

include the dorms, where a
large amount of graffiti and
vandalism can also be found.
“If something relating to‘
buildings or building opera-
tions is affected by vandal-
ism we, of course, get into
the territory,” Graham said.
If a surface needs to be

cleaned or painted, Pitt Paint
Shop workers are responsible
for it.

About one—tenth of the
shop works on graffiti
removal, Boyce said. “About
a year and a half ago there
were a couple of people
going crazy [vandalizing.]
You could see their name
everywhere. That’s when we
started logging

clean up graffiti, that’s the
best deterrent to having it
come back. The more they
see their name the more they
want to write it."

“And if people see writing
on a wall they tend to go up
and add a little bit to it,”
Graham added.

rooms and laboratories is

Graham also said that there
are different kinds of things
that people don’t call graffiti
but that take money and paint
shop workers’ time —- such
as posting up handbills or
meeting announcements.
Often these signs are posted
with some sort of adhesive or

ple. There was no alignment.”

The chancellor should further his work with
the trustees, faculty, staff, students, community
and Harrisburg, Holland said.

Student Government Board President Julie
Crowell agreed that the new chancellor should
be visible on campus and listen to people’s
concerns. A

“[Pitt needs] a chancellor who will be acces-
sible to the faculty, more visible to the student
body,” Crowell said. “I think students would
like to see a face with a name.”

Staff Association Council President Darlene
Harris said she had already received phone
calls yesterday about O’Connor’s resignation
and his successor. One person suggested that
the university ﬁnd a chancellor locally who
would be sensitive to the needs of the area’s
issues and community.

The chancellor needs to be able to commu-
nicate with members of the university, be ener-
getic and have a clear understanding of the
university’s mission, said Professor Philip
Wion, Senate Budget Policies Committee
chair. The person needs to be actively engaged
in dialogue and ‘approach all groups with seri-
ousness and respect. »

“I hope the university will be able to ﬁnd
someone like that,” Wion said.

Herbert Chesler, an economics professor
and past University Senate president, said a
chancellor should draw on the faculty and
staff ’s knowledge. 0

“What’s most important is a person who has I

an understanding of shared governance, who
has respect for that governance  I want to see
a chancellor come here to solicit [knowledge]
from faculty and staﬂ’,” Chesler said.

“I think his resignation is an occasion for
serious reﬂection on the relationship between
administration, faculty and staff,” he said.

Crowell saidwith the uncertainty of who the
next chancellor will be, she is concerned with
the university’s future. “The time period com-
ing up_will be crucial to the ur_1iversity’s suc-
cess,” she said. “I really do see people pulling
together. Everyone really needs to stick togeth-
er.”‘

Holland said the university’s morale is pret-
ty low right now, and the interim period will
be difficult, but the future morale may change.
“I think there will be an improvement in
morale in the long-run — I believe we can
ﬁnd a good chancellor.”

Chesler said these are uncertain times for the
university as well as other institutions with
government cuts on research grants and
decreased state funding.

There will be difﬁcult times and a difﬁcult
environment, said VV1on, but there are a lot of
good people at the university eager to work
with one another and some exciting times
intellectually as well.

“Everyone will have to work hard to see that
the university moves forward and does not
miss out on opportunities,” said Wion.

According to Leon Haley, vice chancellor
for public and student affairs, that is what the
university plans to do.

“We want to continue to maintain those
things that will move the institution forwar ,”
Haley said. '

“The reality is that we’re going through
these periods in the history of a great institu-
tion. As you go through those phases, obvi-
ously there’s a transition, but the core of the
institution continues.”

If you’ve already taken the
step of registering with the

minutes to visit our ofﬁce and
double-check your resume file
to ensure an adequate supply.
This is especially important if
you're leaving the Pittsburgh
area after graduation.

When you were a kid, your
parents probably told you how
important it was to do a job

I with the right set of tools. In a

job search, your tools include
a well-crafted resumé. Before

For all of you undergrads
out there, the smart thing to do
this summer is to try and
obtain some career-related
experience. Experience is
cited by many recruiters as a
critical element in evaluating
candidates. Also, a lot of
employers use summer and
part-time employees as’ a sort
of ‘farm club’ that will pro-
vide the organization with pro-

experience is what you’re
after, visit the summer/part-

to check it out. It’s been total-

Registration with the sum-

The old RA’s room would

One of the main reasons for
the coming about of this pro-

ﬁnancial woes.

“The university made some
very serious ﬁnancial errors in

Don't stop the press

The freedom of the press has once again been compromised
on an American college campus. Black students at D_ePaul
University in Chicago have staged a sit-in to shut down the
weekly campus paper, The DePaulia.

According to The New York Times, the students complain that
The DePaulia’s coverage of a disturbance at a dance held by a
black student organization reﬂects racist attitudes. The article
used police reports which identified whether the students were
black or white. '

The protestors say this contributes to racial stereotypes and
and want certain changes-made in the editorial content of the
paper. For example, they would like to see one page a week
devoted to minority issues.

The DePaulia’s editor told The New York Times that the school
administration halted publication of the paper until the editorial
staff agreed to meet some of the protestors’ demands. This is the
first protest in five years to halt publication of a college newspa-
per. . \

Whether student groups, administrators or government try to
control the editorial content of a paper from the outside, it is still
censorship. This is another case of someone trying to "impose
external standards on the press. a

The Pitt News will not mention the race of any individual
involved in a news story unless his race is integral to the story.
For example, we would not print “that white guy O’Connor
resigned.” In a story about racial discrimination, however, or in
the description of a suspect in a crime report, race becomes a
relevant issue and is included in the article.

Asking the paper to devote a page a week to minority issues is
not something which can be said to stem directly from the article
which was written. This is another example of an attempt for
some group to use an editorial decision as a jumping off point
for establishing their social views on society. If someone wants
to use a newspaper to make a comment on society, ‘then they
should go to the editorial page. It is there to provide that outlet.
The news very oftentimes is a reﬂection of society. Sometimes
that is uncomfortable to its members, but it is nonetheless true.

A newspaper’s job is to report news which is relevant to, or I

which interests, its audience. In the insular environment of a col-
lege campus, these areas are somewhat different than in a larger

community, and the newspapers and other media must reﬂect.

that.

Halting publication amounts to mere coercion. Whenever any
group or individual can hold that threat over a newspaper or
printer, then freedom of the press is lost.

An open democratic society must be based on the freedom of
people to present their ideas. This does not mean they should be
able to do so without having those ideas challenged. It does

mean that they should challenge the ideas which they are pre-

sented with, whether they come from a newspaper, television or
man on a soapbox.

Raw?!

Students have

' s all students are realiz-
ing, the end of the term
's fast approaching. I’m

concentrating on my present
assignments in order to success-
fully reach the end. Some
senior students aren’t going to
make it. They’ll ﬂunk and more
than likely scream the big “F!”
It won’t be the first time a
student has ﬂunked. I did some
recent research at Hillman
Library, and it seems that ﬂunk-
ing was pretty common back
during the 1940s. In fact,

there’s an interesting book that

tells the tale of a student named

Willie Dewthis. Dewthis faced‘

ﬂunking. But, before I tell you
Dewthis’ story, let me define
research. _

To me, research has a
metaphoric, time-machine char-
acteristic. Research entails
looking up past views in order
to craft present theories that
have future impact. Indeed,
when all the research pieces are
properly laid together, the craft-
ing can take on magical quali-
ties.

Back in 1944 a senior named
Willie Dewthis wasn’t sure if
he’d be graduating. Forlorn and
fraught, Dewthis walked the
campus with his head down. On
one such trek he noticed a
sealed envelope on the ground.
Dewthis opened the envelope
and‘ found three tattered, but
official looking, university
application forms.

Dewthis read the first form.
Apparently, back in the 1940s,
a senior could file an applica-
tion to become a freshman
again. Something about a lack
of students because of the war.

Dewthis pondered over. his
interesting discovery. This form
meant that he could go back
and take all_the same courses
again and surely pass them. He
would have an advantage over
his unsuspecting classmates. Or
for that matter, he could go
back and even take a different
academic course load that could
lead to different career choices
than he presently faced.

As Dewthis thought about the

first form, he brought his thumb

’wi//ies ’ about college careers

to his lips and dampened it
slightly. He then used his moist-
ened digit to peel away the top
brittle form and uncovered the
second form.

The second fonn detailed the
procedures for a senior to get a
job regardless of final grades.
This alternative was very inter-
esting to Dewthis. He could
have a sure thing, a bona fide
job and just come back to finish
later. An alternative that pre-
sented a kind of grab-the-
money-but-don’t-exactly—run
option.

The two applications had pre-

sented to Dewthis his own
metaphoric time machines. He
could go back. He could go for-
ward. The past versus the future
decision fork in the road of life.
If you were given these
options about your college
career, what would you do?
Due to Pitt's declining enroll-
ment, I understand that the

forms may be resurrected if-

enough students petition the
powers that be for them.

Before you answer, let me tell
you about the third sheet of
paper Dewthis found in the
envelope. The third sheet
wasn’t an application form.
Instead, it was a sheet full of
statistics.

In 1944, statistics showed

that if students could make the
selection, most students would
time travel backward to the past
in order to change a decision.

In 1944, statistics said most
men felt it was their duty to
ﬁght in the war. ‘

In 1944, a decision had to be
made by Willie Dewthis: Will
He Do This?

Surprise! Research shows
that Willie Dewthis is a make-
believe character for the phrase
“will he do this.” He might as
well be sole proprietor of a
fudge—ma'king factory for as
much as this article’s research is
fudged.

In a sweet way, though, I
hope I made you think about
your college days. Whether
you’re thinking they’ve been
good or bad is your call.

_ Personally, I can tell you that

you shouldn’t fall into the trap
of believing decisions are irre-
versible if bad or eternal if
good. I can definitely tell you
that you should ﬁrmly believe
only you decide the merits of
your decisions.

At the end of senior year,
many students seem to have the
“willies” about their academic
tenure. There seems to be a
slightly longer pause when con-
templating how, they will form
with society.

Have you every noticed how
people frequently stop at door-
ways when saying good-bye or
hello? I believe that there is sig-
nificance in this portal pause
that also applies to the end of
senior year. “Other side of the
door” issues are evident at
senior year’s end both physical-
ly and emotionally.

Physically, once we step
through a door, it’s obvious
we’re on the other side. A
locale change much like when
you physically leave campus
and move on to the work world.

Spiritually, we emotionally
sense we’ve left more than the
physical on the other side of the
door. Friends, other decisions
and even time itself are exam-
ples.

The popularity of movies like
“Back To The Future” indicates
that many of us are fascinated
with a time-travel theme. I pro-
pose that this popularity stems
from our personal desires to

time travel. Mainly, for two rea- V

sons —— to change a decision
and to see history.

I’ll leave the mental health
debate to the psychiatrists con-
cerning time travel and decision
changing.

History? Well, you’re making
it as you read this article.
Everything that you do
becomes your personal history.
But remember, do your own
research. Check your past
points-of-view. Whether you
regret or relish what you find,
you can do this about it  keep
doing!

For years the NCAA has
speculated and probed the
ex-UNLV coach for paying
his athletes, giving benefits
and overall running a dirty
program. But after years of
scrutiny, the NCAA
couldn’t pin anything on
the Tark except for running
illegal practices. Besides
that, nothing was docu-
mented of any Tarkanian
wrong-doings.

But what is documented
is that the Tark has the

long time.

But why‘? Why should
Fresno State be frowned
upon because it hired a
coach that will undoubtedly
breathe air into a corpselike
program? _

Fresno State wants to
win. Tark doesn’t know
how to lose. What a perfect
couple. ’

But the first day the
Shark swam to Fresno State
a dark cloud followed him
because he was breaking a
coaching taboo. He tried to
harpoon the No. 1 point
guard in the country,
Stephon Marbury, who
already gave a verbal com-
mitment to Georgia Tech.

Within the coaching
ranks, trying to woo an
already verbally committed
player is a definite no-no.
But within the NCAA rules
committee,‘ that’s well
within the parameters.

Dietrich Jells might be one of
the busiest students at Pitt this
semester.

As a two-sport standout athlete
in track and football, the six—foot,
190-pound junior’s personal life
is currently nonexistent.

A normal week for the Erie
native consists of two days of
football practice, two days of
track practice, then it’s off to 10
to 15 hours of ’bus rides during
the weekends.

“I miss a lot of class,” Jells
said. “On Thursday, I missed my
ﬁnance exam and I am ﬁnding it
hard to balance my time  all

“When you are trying to bal-
ance two sports it becomes

average student to go to class and
study. But that is a sacriﬁce I had
to make when I decided [to par-
take in both sports].”

But while Jells gets burnt out
by -his busy schedule, his men-
tors believe this dedication will
help J ells down the road.

“Dietrich has the potential to
do whatever he wants to as far as
athletics are concerned,” Pitt
track and field coach Steve

Two men's
gymnasts
compete

at NCAAs

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

Last Saturday two members
of the Pitt men’s gymnastics
team competed in the NCAA
East Regionals which were
held at Penn State University.

“It was a little intimidating
at first,”.said Keith Youndt,
who scored a 9.2 on the par-
allel bars. “But I felt like I fit
in after watching them. I was
just happy to make it.” _

Joining Youndt in Happy
Valley was Karl Chan, who
competed on the high bar and
scored a 9.35.

Chan changed his routine in
an attempt to increase his dif-
ficulty for a higher score.

“I changed my dismount
and practiced it four days
before the meet,” he said. ‘‘I
touched down [on it]
though.”

The gymnasts had strong
showings, but were unable to
place in the top three out of
48 competitors to advance to
the NCAA National
Championships.

“Even though I touched
down, which cost me four-
_tenths, a judge said it was one
of the best.routines all day,”
said Chan. “But he couldn’t
give me a higher» score
because I touched down.”

The men’s gymnastics team
ended their season with a
record of 19-11, giving head
coach Frank D’Amico his
18th consecutive winning
season at Pitt.

“I think it was just a good
ending to a good season,”
said Youndt about the meet.

nationals for the first time in his
collegiate career, Jells felt the
agony of defeat. He ran his slow-
est time of the year (21.6)

“I don’t know if it was all the
hype of the meet, the competi-
tion, my nerves or what,” he
recalls. “But for some reason that
particular meet, I just didn’t do
well. It was kind of depressing
because I picked this particular
meet to choke in. Afterwards I
just sat back and told myself, ‘I
will never let this happen again.’”

Thus far during this outdoor
season he has kept up with his
promise.

Last week in front of a stand-
ing-room—only crowd, Jells took
second to none in the 200-meter
dash at the Duke Invitational in
Durham, N.C.

Jells was clocked at a personal
best time of 21.10 seconds. '

And two weeks ago in
Virginia, he ran a 46-second 400-
meter leg on Pitt’s 4 x 400 relay.

But according to Jells, track is
just a hobby.

“I will have to say my heart is

ent teachers and coaches, I saw
things in a different way.”

Regardless of whether Jells is 1

running with a baton or a football
in his hand, he still has unfin-

. ished business to take care of.

“I have already made it in my
mind that I am going to be an
All-American contributor before

I leave [Pitt] ,” he said.

Open Letter to the Students:

TOWERS C-SIDE CAFETERIA

PITTSBURGH, APRIL 6-- In response to input from the Student
Government Board and petitions signed by 1500 students, the Towers C-side
I cafeteria will remain open next year and the Lothrop cafeteria will be closed
instead. Associate Vice Chancellor for Business John DeVitto said that the
change was made to accommodate student preferences. "Because of the
changing patterns in student dining, we needed to close one of the traditional
cafeterias," he said. "We decided on Lothrop because the students indicated

WILL REMAIN OPEN

that it would be the facility that would be missed the least."

DeVitto added that with the excellent transportation on campus and the
fact that the C-store is available to help support the students living in
Lothrop, the change is not expected to create an unnecessary burden for
students choosing to live there. "If students want to move into Towers
because they View this change as creating a hardship, accommodations will
- be made," he said.   ‘ 1

Vice Chancellor for Student and Public Affairs Leon Haley indicated
that discussions are underway between Student Affairs and Student
Government Board about converting the Lothrop cafeteria into a fitness
center for student use. He said that the SGB is presently compiling the
results of a survey of students to determine what types of equipment and
1 features they would like to see in a fitness center.  

"We View the Lothrop location as a first step in meeting the
Chancellor's commitment to having a fitness center available on the lower
campus," he said. "We will do our best to incorporate all of the students‘
suggestions that are consistent with the physical limitations of the space."

The fitness center is expected to be available for student use at the start

of the fall sememster.

ties and citizenship. Known
as the Blue-Gold Award,
track star Staci Suggs was
the female winner.

Suggs, from Jacksonville,
Fla., qualified for the 1995
NCAA Indoor Track
Championships in the 55-
meter and is a member of
Pitt’s world-record holding
shuttle hurdle relay team.
Suggs has also been on the
dean’s list every semester
since she has been at Pitt.
Her major is pre—med.

The male reciepient of the
Blue-Gold Award was
swimmer Matt Brady.
Brady holds 10 school
records, is a seven—time Big
East champion and has
scored more points for his
team than any other Panther
swimmer (1,005). Brady»
has maintained a 3.6 G.P.A.
as a Russian-European
Studies major.

“As I was a recruit walk-
ing down the Cathedral
Walk there were some peo-
ple that I knew,” Brady
said. “Wow, that would be
amazing to be on that .Walk.
I could walk down there
some day with my kids, and
say ‘That’s your dad, you
can kick it or throw dirt on
it, do anything you want,
but that’s me.’ It’s reality
now.”

All four recipients will
have their names engraved

on the Cathedral Walk. _

Furthermore, the two Blue-

Gold winners will receive a

$4,000 scholarship to pur-
sue their academics.

Aggelou-

Thomas, Jason Maile
and Andre Alridge are
all expected to return
next year, along with
Jerry McCullough,
who should be healthy
after missing last sea-
son with a knee injury.
With the addition of
Kevin Willard,
Vonteego Cummings
and Kellii Taylor, the
backcourt will be

filled up.

Aggelou was born in
Athens, Greece, but
played high school
basketball at Riverside
(Pa.) High School.

“I’m in a situation
where it’s just wait-
ing,” Aggelou said. “I
need to talk to Coach
[Ralph Willard] before
deciding anything.”

Willard could not be
reached for comment.

Tarkanian never claimed
to be in the game of educa-
tion. He lays his cards on
the table for everyone to
see, that’s why players like
the problem-plagued Lloyd
Daniels wanted to play
for UNLV. The Tark
provides a better way of
life for his players. That’s
no crime unless it’s with a
new car or something. *

People are saying that
Tark’s reputation will fol-

they’re right. You’ll be
seeing Fresno State in the
NCAA tournament in the
near future. You can bet on
that (no pun intended).
