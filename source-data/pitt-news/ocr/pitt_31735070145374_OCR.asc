Greeks choose

date for

Pitt

Dance Marathon

Greeks and Black Action Society seek to A 5

reschedule events canceled by snowstorm

Amy Friedenberger
Staff Writer

The Greeks have chosen a tenta-
tive date for the Pitt Dance Mara-
thon, which they had to postpone
because of last month’s historic
snow storm. '

The dance marathon, part of
the Greek Week effort to raise
money for the Universityof Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute, will occur
April 18 in the Fitzgerald Field
House, if Panhellenic Council,
the National Pan—Hellenic Coun-
cil and the Interfraternity Coun—
cil receive approval from the ad-
ministration.

Normally, the event runs for
24 hours, but if it occurs April
18, it will only last six to eight
hours. Vanessa Cominsky, who
oversees Greek Week, said that
when the marathon runs for 24
hours, the organizers reserve
the Fitzgerald Field House for
three days to allow for setup and
cleanup. They decided to reduce
the time of the marathon because
they could only reserve the field
house for one day.

“It’s extremely difficult trying
to scramble at the last minute to
put together such a large-scale
event,” Cominsky said, noting
that she and other Pitt Dance
Marathon organizers had to work

$219Imo*

   

around the athletic schedule.

If the organizers can’t hold the
marathon April 18, they will try
to hold a different event in which
the students can pledge to raise
money for the cancer institute.
One personproposed having a
cookout at the Petersen Events
Center, Cominsky said.

The marathon is part of Greek
Week. In 2004, the fraternities
and Panhellenic sororities agreed
to raise $500,000 for the cancer
institute over the course of five
years. The deadline is at the end
of the semester.

The dance marathon cancella-
tion should not affect the pledge.
Cominsky said that after talk-

.ing to the Greek houses, they all

agreed to donate the money they
pledged for the event even if the
Pitt Dance Marathon does not
happen. _

“We’re trying to do the best we

— can with the situation we are in,”

Cominsky said. “You just can’t ﬁt
a square peg into a round hole.”

The Black Action Society orig-
inally planned to hold its fash-
ion show during the Pitt Dance
Marathon because of schedul-
ingconﬂicts. Cominsky said the
groups will now hold their events
separately. V

Tuskegee airman speaks in Union

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

As a kid, Roscoe C. Brownjr. spent his time
reading magazines that featured famous
pilots and made model airplanes. Hopes of
ﬂying ran through his head.

Not many years later, Brown was ﬂying

for the United States. He was the squadron _

commander of the 100th Fighter Squadron of
the 332nd Fighter Group, otherwise known as
the Tuskegee Airmen, during World War II.

Thursday afternoon in the William Pitt
Union’s Kurtzman Ballroom, community
members, faculty and students gathered to
hear Brown’s lecture, “Tuskegee Airmen: A
Model for Excellence.”

Pitt’s Swanson School of Engineering,
School of Education, Office of Public Affairs
and Office of Student Affairs hosted the event
in recognition of Black History Month.

Sylvanus Wosu, associate dean for diver-
sity affairs, organized the event two months
ago, hoping the audience would see the im-

pact of resilience and how “failure is not an

option unless you it make it one.”

Wosu chose to feature Brown because
“he is a great way of highlighting the accom-
plishments of the black community and the
contributions they have made.”

In a separate interview, history professor

Laurence Glasco explained how the Tuskegee
Airmen began at Tuskegee Institute in Ala-
bama, which had a pilot training program
for black people.

“The Air Force was reluctant to use Af-
rican-Americans. However, after Eleanor
Roosevelt took a ﬂight with a Tuskegee In-
stitute instructor and was impressed, she

campaigned for them to be included in the »

Air Force, and they were eventually taken
in,” Glasco said:

The Air Force began recruiting people
from black colleges nationwide, looking for
top students and athletes.

“I was 20 years old, a college graduate,
Valedictorian of my class,” Brown said.

“These men were the cream of black man-
hood, highly educated, very professional an

?10<_............a

well trained,” Glasc said. A ,

Despite being a part of the Air Force, black
people were still treated differently from
white people. The War Deparment’s 1925

' study concluded that black people should

not be in combat, and the military was seg-
regated during this time. ' '

“They set up a separate base forAfrican-
Americans,” Brown said.

There were people against them the
whole time, including one white commander
who “thought his role was to make us fail,”
Brown said. “There was a lot of serious preju-
dice.”

“We had excellence in our selection, train-
ing  but could we go to combat?” Brown
asked the audience.

The answer was yes.

Brown and his squadron escorted the
bombers, B-17 and B-24 plaines, over Ger-
many, bombing structures such as German
airﬁelds, manufacturing plants and rail-
roads. ‘ -

 

“Our job was to protect them [bombers]
and make sure they don’t go down,” Brown
said.

All the pilots the Tuskegee Airmen es- -
_ corted were white. Brown said many were

happy to have skilled men on their side.
“They called us the Red Tail Angels. We

became the best escort ﬁghters in the world,”

he said. ’ ’

The success of the Tuskegee Airmen con— -

tributed to the desegregation of the military
in 1948 by Harry S. Truman.

“They helped change the attitudes of
having African—Americans in the military,”
Glasco said. L,

Brown stressed an equation that will help

' anyone can become a model for excellence,

even through adversity.

“Three ‘p’ equals ‘e,”’ he said to the audi-
ence. “Preparation, perseverance and pride
equal excellence. We can all reach a level of
excellence. It is up to us to open those doors
of opportunity for excellence.”

No Makeup March, the grassroots brain-

is a month-long challenge issued to women en-

‘ “It’sawaytostandupagainstwhatwe’re‘sup-V E

the political action chair of Campus Women’s

ated an eventfor No Makeup March on Facebook
and hoped people from other schools would
join in.

Towers, who went to high school with Lane

don’t need to wear makeup. V

“[Makeup] deﬁnitely boosts women’s ego and A

with the Maybelline representative.

Tian Qiu has chosen to not wear makeup

she joined because she thinks society has a lot

“[The beauty industry]'has gotten really good

Lane said the goal of this event is not to ban

women “questioning why [they] made_ that
choice,” Lane said. “I want women feelingpretty

“We just want women to feel comfortable in

The push for natural beauty  been taken to '

anational level, with t_heDove Campaign for Real

A customer representative for Dove, who also

declined to give herfull name because she wasn’t

is trying to get across the message that beauty
comes in all shapes and sizes.”

V No Makeup March tries to emphasize that
wearing makeup is a personal choice. The dis-

‘ claimer on the event page reads, “No Make-Up
March is askingyou to examine why you decide ~

to (or not to!) wear make-up —— not telling you
which route to feminism is the best one.”

“Women should supporteach other’s choices,
but these choices should be ones they actually
make,” Lane said. i .

Allison Norlander, a sophomore at Pitt, said
she doesn’t necessarilyfeelempoweredby choos-
ing to not wear makeup. . '

“I don’t reallypay attention,” said Norlander,
who said wearing makeup has kind of become
a habit, but whether she wears it depends upon
how much time she has.

Less than one week into the event, Qiu’s
choice to not wear makeup has had little effect
on her life. '

“I don’t feel any different My life hasn’t really
changed, which drives home the point of how
urmecessary makeup is,” said Qiu, adding that
not wearing makeup has “empowered [her] to
get to class on time.”

U.S. Postal Service a hole in our pockets

   

Steve Kaszycki
For The Pitt News

 
 

Did you ever think you’d miss snail
mail? Well, you just might, for a
day. ( '
According to CNNMoney, the
U.S. Post Service has announced that

it needs to make signiﬁcant changes .

to avoid losing an estimated $238
billion over the next 10 years.

b The moves are what one would
expect to hear: Eliminate Saturday
service, while elirrlinating the pre-
paid retirement health beneﬁts plan.
The estimated savings from these
two moves is $90 billion.

Great, so it would only lose $148 it

billion — and that’s if the retirement

health savings account adjustment
goes through. That is much better, ,

but maybe other options need to be

considered. In truth, the Post Service-

needs to do something that it is likely
unwilling to consider: privatize.

By privatize, I mean, in the long‘,

term, die. The Postal Service is a relic
that has been propped up by the gov-

ernment. For years, it has been‘suf—
fering losses, the latest being $3.8
billion, following losses of $2.8 bil-
lion and $5 billion.in previous years,
according to CNN. I doubt that the
Postal Service can turn the circum-
stances around, even if it were tasked
with having to survive on its own,
without the comfy, inﬂated cushion
of big government backing it.

The payroll for salaries and wages
in the Postal Service every two weeks
amounts to $2.1 billion, according to

" The Washington Post. Translated to
quarterly .data, these ﬁgures exceed

V the labor expense of FedEx. One of

the major reasons behind this reality

is that government doesn’t have to

be cost—effective — when govern-

. ment spends more than it takes in, it

simply taxes more or borrows more
to cover the shortage.

Keeping the Postal Service makes
about as much sense as trying to
restart the Pony Express." They’re
both outdated. Video didn’t kill the
radio star, but the Internet killed the
Postal Service. It wasn’t a shotgun
blast, more like a slow bleed —— as

more and more people gained In-

ternet access and online banking
and shopping technology improved
at exponential levels, the sectors
that traditionally drove the Postal
Service’s business model simply
evaporated.

Today, companies are increas-
ingly using direct deposit, bypassing
the old convention of mailing outthe
check. Personal communication is
done through e-mail, Facebook and

MySpace. ~_

And even more-people are be-
coming computer literate, We as-
sume thatpeople are capable ofusing
a telephone, so why not a computer?
For those elderly people who lack the
knowledge of home computing, or
for individuals with special needs,
a tiny fraction of the budget of the
Postal Service could be used to es-
tablish support programs ensuring
that they are not left behind by the
technologicalwinds.

But arguing that the jobs of a
small subgroup of Americans justify
maintaining an unproﬁtable, inef-
ﬁcient and antiquated enterprise is

unwise. It is the equivalent of the
government subsidizing the horse-
drawn carriage industry for those
who were unable to operate motor
vehicles.

Scaling back delivery, increasing
the cost of stamps, etc., will not ﬁx

what is irreparably broken. In fact, .

these moves may drive more people
to the private sector competition
and to a greater reliance on Internet
technology. 1

Moreover, it will impair the
business model of Netflix — which
now delivers on a six—day—per-week
schedule in the Pittsburgh area and
would face increased costs from the
price hikes, likely accelerating the
compa_ny’s shift toward an, on- de-
mand, streaming delivery system.

An unfortunate side-effect of
privatizing and likely folding up is
that some hard-workingpeople will
lose their j obs. This shouldn’t be tak-
en lightly —'— losing what seemed like
a viable career option is a traumatic
event, and those who would face this
would have some difficulties. A

But when we push toward a more

_ Just eliminating Saturday post won’t address the program ’s fundamental deﬁciencies — privatization will.

effective, more modernized econo-
my, everyone wins in the end.

The typewriter repairman lost his
career — for the moment — when
the home computer became a staple
of households. Before that, carriage
makers, sellers and repairmen lost
out to Henry Ford, and so on.

Hard—working people are con-
tinually faced with the necessity of
ﬁnding new lines of employment in
the wake of technological innova-
tion, and to attempt to subvert this
process would be to cling to outdated
systems. ,

.We can’t justify segments of
government merely because of cul-
tural identity —— the mailman has
a well-developed cultural image in
the United States, clad in blue and
way of perpetually unﬁiendly dogs.
Sooner or later, however, that will

‘ have to become an image of the past.

So let’s put that image into history
sooner and reduce our losses while
we can.

Ensemble jazzes up music department

Pittjazz Ensemble Spring Concert
April 15, 8 p.m.

William Pitt Union Assembly Room
Students $5, General Admission $10.
Call (412) 624-4187 for more
information.

From trips toJamaica, to local out-
reach programs, to a swinging spring
concert topped with performances
around the globe, Pitt’s world—re-
nownedJazz Ensemble keeps playing

‘away to audience raves.

Butthe members ofthejazz Ensem-
ble aren’t world—renowned trumpeters
and famous saxophone players — not
yet anyway.

They’re part of a unique two-hour
credit class that meets twice aweek on
campus and is composed of both mu-
sic and non-music majors who simply
have a passion for jazz. Students aren’t
even requiredtotake theJazz Ensemble
as a class to participate, although they
must audition during the fall term to
join the group.

Dr. Nathan Davis, a professor of
music and the director ofJazz Studies
at Pitt, founded the Ensemble in 1969.
The jazz group currentlyconsists ofap-
proximately 21 members, accordingto
ProfessorLeon Dorsey,who addedthat
most of the students have been playing
since the fourth or fifth grade.

Professor Dorsey is in his second
year as coordinator of theJazz Ensem-
ble. He is abassist from Pittsburgh but
now lives in New York City, where he

still continues to perform.
One ofthe highlights ofthe program
is an annual two-week trip to Negril,
Jamaica, where the group has visited
for the past 20 years. President Shana
Fowler; a senior trumpet player; became
involved speciﬁcally because of theJa—
maica trip.

Her primary role as president is to
organize the trip, a daunting, but ulti-
mately satisfyingt:asl<.Whi1e inJamaica,
the talented musicians perform every
dayforschool children and community

Senior AnthonyJoseph, an electric
and double bass player; participated in
the trip last year.

“It’s really rewarding,” he says. “You
get to see the countryside and play for
the kids.”

Sophomore saxophone playerAlex
Harshberger also attended the trip last
year. .
‘A lot of the (Jamaican) students
ha\fen’t seen a jazz band. After playing

for the students, we show them [our]
own instruments to get students to
interact,” Harshberger said.

Accordingto its website, the group

; haspreviouslyplayed atthe Montreux

Jazz Festival in Switzerland, as well as
in Brazil, Trinidad and the southern
United States.

Thejazz Ensemble’s armual spring
concertwillbe heldonApril15 at8p.m.
in the Wlliam Pitt Union. The concert
was a huge success last year. Almost
500 people came to enjoy the creatively
eclectic jazz selections.’ —

Again this year, an internationally
renowned guestartistwillperform solo,

as well as with the group. This year’s
musicianhas notyet been announced,
butprevious artists have included Curtis
Fuller,James Moody, LarryCorye1l and
Jimmy Owens. 1 ’
Songs being played in this year’s
concert include two Oliver Nelson ar-
rangements, Count Basie songs and
“Down by the Riverside.”
Alexandra Amdt will be singing in

 

 

the upcoming show. Although she is a
senior;this isherﬁrstsemesterwiththe
Ensemble. As abiology major; shewas
previously unable to dedicate the time
required for rehearsals.

For the spring concert, she has
helped with the song selections, one
ofwhichwill include the ballad, “WhenI
FallinLove.”. Previously, shewas asing-
erwith her dad’s jazz ensemble and her

   
   

church choirathome, aswellas asinger
for a rock band back in high school.
The show generallylastsforanhour
and a half. The money earned helps to
ﬁind the annual trip toJamaica as well
asto supportthe costofrunningtheJazz
Ensemble. The cost for the evening of
jazz music comes to just $5 for students
and $10 for general admission. Fortick-
et information call 412-624-4187.

The PittJazz Ensemble takes its craft from the classrooms of Oakland to the stages of foreign countries
' ’ ' ' like Jamaica, Switzerland and Brazil.

Named after Thailand’s an-

old-fashioned charm.

The menu consists of stan-
dard Thai food with staples like
Pad Thai, Thai Beef Salad, Spicy
Fried Rice, Tomyum soup and
curries. Some of the appetizers

are shrimp cakes, dumplings and _

chicken satay. And to be fair, I’ve
never met a shrimp, dumpling or
chicken satay in a restaurant that
I didn’t like.

“Thai it,” beckons the back
of the lunch menu. With no de-
scription on which to base my
appetizer decision, I decided to
“Thai” the shrimp cakes ($6.95)
and a glass of Thai Ice Coffee
($2.25).

Thai Ice Coffee is sweet, dark
coffee waiting on the bottom
of a glass to be stirred into the
milk sitting on top. The drink
was sweet, like Thai Ice Coffee
is supposed to be, strong and

perfect. .

Robert Jackson, one of the
owners, brought out the four

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Brooklyn’s Finest’ could have been finer

Overture Films’ newest cop creation is more show than substance.

Andy 'I‘ybout
Staff Writer

“Brooklyn’s Finest”

Overture Films

Dir: Antoine Fuqua

Starring: Richard Gere, Don
Cheadle, Ethan Hawke, Wesley
Snipes

Grade: C+

Here’s a foolproof formula for
a crime drama.— lots of shooting,

V lots of sex and lots of deaths in gritty
 characters in a single apartment

projects amid piles of money. ;

' At least that’swhat “'I‘rain1n' gDay_?? 
director Antoine Fuqua must have

thought when he made ‘.‘Brooklyn’s
Finest,” an obtuse, directionless 140-

. minute quagmire.  ’
The story is an ungraceful mesh- ‘

ing of crime narratives: a crooked cop
(Ethan Hawke at his most unhinged)
who steals drug money to pay for his
new home, awearied, straight-edged

cop (Richard Gere) who’s simply '

counting the days until retirement

and a narc (Don Cheadle) who’s been

undercover for far too long.

Their stories are different only in
the superﬁcial sense —- each charac-
terhailsfromadifferentbackground.
In the end, however, they’re all prone
to the same unexpected bouts ofvio—
lence. Ethan Hawke grows increas-
ingly ruthless in his pursuit of fast

cash. Richard Gere becomes suddenly .

intolerant of street cruelty. Cheadle
ﬁnds himself increasingly prone to
gangster conceptions of justice. Their
stories eventually pool (sort of) in a
climax as violent as it is convoluted:
aweak attempt to associate all three

building. ’

T But it’s not like the movie imme-
diately reeks of camp. The dialogue,
particularly in the opening scene, is
sharp, and the setup seems prom-
ising. The acting, especially from
Don Cheadle and the always-frantic
Ethan Hawke, pulls more than its own
weight. It’s only around the middle of
the movie, when the threads of nar-
rative remain unconnected, that the
viewer begins to realize “Brooklyn’s
Finest” doesn’t know what it’s doing.

Homeowners
Life - Health

In short, it’s the plot that
fails the ﬁlm.

The screenplay, penned N
by former subway worker
Michael C. Martin, could
have been a breakthrough
on par with Diablo Cody’s
“Juno.” But the arc of the
story, the coherent nar-
rative blueprint that jus-
tiﬁes the action, remains
elusive.

With smarter, prefer-
ably aggressive revision,
the movie could have been
onparwith-“'I‘rainingDay.”
For example, if “Brooklyn’s
Finest” revolved around
only one protagonist, it
would be both more pow-
erﬁil and more focused.

The individual characters are
compelling enough, and their sto-
ries are sufﬁciently embedded in
the Brooklyn environment that they
could probably stand on their own.
Maybe then, real meaning could be
wrung from this otherwise bloated
ﬁlm.

Symphony is the only one

But as it is, “Brooklyn’s Finest”
is a mediocre crime drama striving
to emulate great crime dramas. The
shootouts are there, the psychological
deterioration is there and the street
philosophy is there. But it’s not a co-
hesive marriage. The ﬁlm delves into
the trappings of the genre without an
angle, an idea. '

“Brooklyn’s Finest” is a movie to
see ifyou enjoy only the most obvious
aspects of the genre — the brutality
without the intelligence. But you’ll
walk away no more enlightened than
you will from playing “Grand Theft
Auto.” For what’s it’s worth, “The De-
parted” is available to rent for less
than the price of a movie ticket.

Shortly after came the Spicy Basil Noo-
dles, which the menu described as “stir-
fried rice noodles, egg, napa (Asian cab—
bage) and basil leaf.” The noodle and rice
entrees can be made with chicken, beef,
pork, tofu or shrimp, which determine the
price ($7.95 to $12.95). Customers order
entrees on a spiciness scale of one to 10.
I asked for chicken at a level ﬁve.

When the noodles came, I was delighted
that the rice noodles were my favorite
type of noodle. These ﬂat and wide rice
noodles are called “chow fun” in Canton-
ese, but I understand the Thai call them
“kway teow.”

These noodles are soft on the tongue

' and perfect in a stir fry. Somy Jackson,

Sukhothai’s second owner, expertly cooked
these somewhat sticky noodles without
making them greasy. The chicken pieces
were tender, and the napa added a nice
crunch to contrast the soft noodles. I only
wish that it had more basil.

The large portion was too much for
me to eat along with the appetizer, so I
happily took a third of my entree home
for a late-night snack. The noodles don’t
harden so much that they can’t be salvaged
in the microwave. That’s how you know
they’re fresh.

Robert and Somy Jackson have been

married for 18 years and opened Sukhothai '

on First Avenue Downtown about threeand
a half years ago, but they decided to move
to Oakland about a month ago because of

consistent business from students, as well
as University and UPMC staff.

Sukhothai’s mission to cater Oakland’s
college crowd appropriately coincides
with the restaurant’s secondary mission
to educate the patrons about Thailand. On
a whiteboard by the cash register, there’s
a Thai word of the day.

When Robert met Somy, who is Thai,
he said he knew a little about Thailand,
but now he’s learning Thai and hopes to
retire there someday.

“I think it’s great to get to know a cul-
ture personally,” Robert said.

Sukhothai’s dining room feels spacious
with many two- and four—person tables to
seat about 65 people. Somy brought the

‘brightly colored tablecloths and many of
the small pictures on the wall back from
Thailand.

Small red lights over each table and the
religious idols that rest upon shelves and
countertops create a homey atmosphere
in the restaurant, and Thai karaoke tunes
play faintly over laptop speakers. Patrons

’ are free to kick back and enjoy their own
alcoholic beverages, but the restaurant .
charges a $1 corking fee for each beer -

bottle and $3 for a wine bottle.

The Jacksons plan to hold Thai cooking
classes for groups of six or eight in the
restaurant every other Sunday for about
two and a half hours.

“Don’t come thinking it’ll be work,
work, work,” he said. “It’s about having
fun.”

First bout key to Pitt’s title-clinching win

' Wrestling 4 1

. freshman matchup to kick off the
match was the key. .

“Pat had said early in the night
that if we could win that bout,
it was going to get Pitt off to a
great start,” Utter said. “He was
right.”

Pitt freshman Anthony Zanet-
ta won the bout, setting up ﬁve
straight wins for Pitt to open the
match. Utter texted a score update
to his friend and former teammate
in Portland, Ore., Matt Rizzo, after
Pitt won the second bout.

Rizzo was walking his three
dogs outside and stopped to see
the latest update. He ﬁnally called
Utter.

“He was screaming and yelling

‘ about the freshman, mostly play-
by-play things,” Rizzo said.
, Santoro, Utter and Rizzo all
wrestled at Pitt under Stottlemyer
} from 1986 to 1990. Santoro had
“the most success out of the three,

winning back-to—back national '

titles in 1988 and 1989 at 142

pounds.
» Santoro remembers Stottle-

. myer’s unrelenting care for his

athletes.

“There were times when I was
there in the springtime or over the
summertime, and I’d run into him
around 11 o’clock at night. He’d.
say, ‘Hey, you want to work out?’”
Santoro said. “Sure enough, we’d
go up and work out until midnight
sometimes.” I '

Utter has a distinct memory of

Utter, who earned four degrees I

from Pitt — B.A., M.A. and Ph.D.

butes most of his academic suc-
cess to Stottlemyer. _

Now-a full-time professor at

ter said he nearly failed out of Pitt
and was placed on academic pro-
bation. But one day, Stottlemyer

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Women kick off Big East tournament

3 The Pitt women ’s basketball team takes on Louisville today in Hartford, Conn., with hopes for NCAA consideration.

Lauren Kirschman
“ Seniorlstaﬁ Writer

?The Big East season didn’t go as
‘planned for the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team.

The Panthers (16-13, 5-11) suf-
fered a ﬁve-game and a four-game
losing streak during conference
play, often keeping up with some
of the top teams in the conference
before fading in the closing min-
utes. V

As Pitt kicks off the Big East

Jtournament today, the Panthers
know what they have to do to jump

 into NCAA Tournament consider--

iation — and it won’t be an easy
task.

“We have to run the table,” head

~ coach Agnus Berenato said after

E

~

Pitt’s 77-65 loss to St._]ohn’s in its‘

regular season ﬁnale.

For the Panthers, running the
table would mean getting through
a tournament bracket that holds
ﬁve top-25 teams, with three in
the top _ten, including No. 1 Con-

" necticut, which has won 69 straight

games.

Unfortunately for Pitt, three of
those top-25 teams are in its side
of the bracket: No. 1 Connecticut,
No. 6 Notre Dame and No. 16 St.
John’s.

But before the Panthers can at-
tempt to avenge their losses from
the regular season, they have to
get by a team looking for a little
revenge of its own.

Pitt opens the Big East tour-
nament as the No. 12 seed in the
16-team tournament with a game

against No. 13-seed Louisville at
noon today. The Panthers defeated
Louisville 72-69 on Feb. 14.

Brittaney Thomas led all scor-
ers with 22 points as Pitt held off
the Cardinals earlier this season.
The win broke a four-game losing
streak for the Panthers and started
a stretch of three wins. .

. Thomas was key in that game
for Pitt, taking big shots and mak-
ing key plays down the stretch
when the team could have faltered.
A repeat of Thomas’ performance

' could go a long way in getting the

Panthers to Saturday in Hartford.
“ [Thomas] really showed no
fear, and she showed a lot of charac-
ter on the offensive end,” Berenato
. said after the win. “She attacked.
She was what we call ‘in the ﬂow of

the game,’ and I think she wanted '

the ball. She wanted to take the
shots.”

Since then, Thomas has contin-
ued her impressive offensive game,

s'coring a career—high 27 points in _

the ﬁnale against St.John’s.

Jania Sims and Taneisha Har-
rison j oined Thomas in double ﬁg-
ures against Louisville, with 16 and
10 points, respectively.

Four Louisville players scored
in double ﬁgures in the defeat. Mo-
nique Reid led the Cardinals with 20
points, while Keshia Hines added
17. Becky Burke and Shelby Harper

‘contributed 15 and 11 points, re-

spectively. -

The Panthers are entering the ‘
Big East tournament conﬁdently.‘

With the regular season over they
can look forward to a new start.

“We think about back on the ,

games, how we could haveahget

' [teams], and things that we did

wrong,” Pitt junior Shayla Scott
said. “The Big East tournament is
a whole new season, and I think
once we realize that, we’ll be able
to make a change.” __
Berenato said that the te§rh’s

' “spirit will not be killed.”

“I won’t let it be killed,” Ber-
enato said. “They won’t let it be
killed. Our spirit is: Okay, regular
season is over. We will not be de-
nied.” @-

However, Thomas said that
there are adjustments that the
Panthers need to make in order
to ﬁnd success in the next phase
of their season. Most notably, she
pointed to rebounding and clgsing
out games.

Panthers look for new start  

Women’s basketball 4 11

Thomas said. “At the end of the game, we
don’t push it. I don’t want to say that we don’t
want it bad enough, but we just don’t put that
V effort all the way to‘ make it all the way to end
and just win the game. We’re going to need
i more effort, more rebounding, all of tha .”
If the Panthers make it past Louisville,
they should be able to enter the game against
No. 5 Notre Dame with some conﬁdence.
Pitt played the Fighting Irish tough in South
Bend, eventually losing 86-76 on Feb. 6.
Berenato said she felt like the Panthers
were “starting to get it together” after that

game. Sure enough, Pitt notched their victory

over Louisville shortly after. __
Waiting with a double bye if Pitt makes it

to the quarterﬁnals is No. 4-seed St. _]ohn’s,

the team the Panthers fell to in its season

ﬁnale. If the Panthers run into the Red Storm
again, they’ll be prepared for Kelly McMan—
mon. V _
McManmon scorched the Panthers from
the three in their last meeting, shooting
6-9 from beyond the arc. Berenato said she
should be named the Sixth Player of the Year
for the conference.

‘Alan, if you want to continue to wrestle
here, you’ve gotta be a student ﬁrst. You
need to make a commitment to your aca-
demics and put the same effort intoyour
academics as you’re doing with athletics,”’
Utter said. ' .

But Stottlemyer didn’t leave it at that.

“There were study halls and follow-up
meetings,” Utter said. “I was on the vergeof
flunking out, but I was able to pull it around
my junior and senior year, get my GPA up
high enough to get into graduate school and
then went on to get a Ph.D.”

It was time for Utter to cheer on his for-
mer coach from miles away.

. He said he was yelling so much, the
painters looked at him through the window
on his door. Santoro said he was watching
the match online, as well.

But the match took a turn _ for the
worse. / '

“When the 174-pound guy got pinned, I

. thought, ‘Oh, great, not again,’” Rizzo said.

“I started getting a little nervous, but I knew

from following the team that we were strong

in the last three weights. They’ve come close .

‘ so many times, and I felt like maybe a New
Orleans Saints fan, just wanting them to
ﬁnish it off just this one time.”

Eventually and ﬁttingly, the regular-
season title came down to the heavyweight

~bout. *

-Pitt’s Ryan Tomei made sure Pitt was
victorious, winning his bout 7-3 to give Pitt

. and Stottlemyer an EWL regular-season

championship, thanks to a 21-13 win.
The win drew smiles from Pittsburgh
to Portland. ‘

. “For me, growing up in Pittsburgh be-
ing a huge Steelers‘ fan, it was just as good
as the Steelers winning the Super Bowl,”
Rizzo said. , A ’

It even featured a post—Super Bowl tra-
dition.

‘ “First of all, I had to dry off. They got
me with the Gatorade bath, so that was

good,” Stottlemyersaid. ‘_‘But seeing a lot 5

of the people there who had followed us for
a long time [and] obviously felt the same
heartaches we felt when we lost it in that lasét
gasp of the match — it was pretty nea .” 

After that, it was a ﬂurry of text mes}
sages, e-mails, phone calls and congratula-
tory handshakes.

“There were a lot of people, some guys,
a guy by the name of Billy. I hadn’t heard
from Billy in 20 years, and he sent'me 
text,” Stottlemyer said. ‘ 

So far, Stottlemyer said he’s talked with
Utter, Santoro and Rizzo.

“It’s nice when you build relationships
with the guys, and they leave,” Stottlemyer
said. “You try and keep it as good as you
can, but it’s_still pretty neat when they call
back and say congratulations.”

At the end of the night, Rizzo received ,

one ﬁnal text from Santoro.

“We won!” A ‘

All three shared a moment with their
former coach. It was one they couldn’t prol-
vide for themselves but felt just as much a
part of it as anyone. -\ 7

“It’s great for alumni to ‘see what’s hap-
pening because I felt like I was there,” Utter
said. “It was 20 years ago, and I felt like;
was back in the Field House competing. lit
had that same kind of energy.” '

ANALYSIS

Big East tourney 2010, a titanic struggle for glory

Randy Lieberman
Senior Stajf Writer

Let’s all rest assured. The Big East has
it right in terms ofbasketball

Big East basketball doesn’t need a
BCS — it has a tournament. And con-
ference expansion? Pﬂt. The Big East
sends 16 teams to Madison Square

Garden in early March, but only one .

comes out a champion. .

It’s March, it’s spring break and it’s
timefortlie Big Easttoumamentto take
‘center stage. '

l The favorites are obviously the top
four. I’mlool<ing at Syracuse, Villanova,
 Pitt andI’llthrowinMar—
quette, too. '

. Asfor the underdogs, they’re the
bottom four—— DePaul, Providence, St.
Johns and Rutgers. Let’s just say these
teams will see a lot of “Mamma Mia!”
on Broadway rather than battle in the

. ‘orange paint.

It’s the best tournament in the na-
tion. Here’s what you need to know.
Players to Watch

Wesleyjohnson, Syracuse — This
guy is third in the Player of the Year
voting, unotﬁcially, behind Ohio State’s
‘EvanTurner and Kent11cky’sJohn Wall,

athleticism and versatility for a small
forward. He’ll be the guy making sure
the 0range’s victories end inregulation,
as opposed to six overtimes, with his
ability to drive past defenders.
Dominiquejones, South Florida-

the world with upset victories? Sure
the Bulls hitarutdown the stretch, but
Jones ﬁts the mold of a player who ap-
pears out ofnowheretoleadhisteamto
victory inthe BigEasttoumament. He
struggles against quicker opponents,
such as Villanova and Louisville, but

if he puts up a Gerry McNamara—like ,

effort, South Florida could go a long
way in the tournament.

Scottie Reynolds, Villanova —-
It’s Reynolds’ last hurrah at Madison
Square Garden as a Wildcat. I’rn will’-
ingtobethewantsto makehisﬁnal
memory of his collegiate career at the
Garden full of net snipping and “Big
East Champions” T-shirt wearing.

GregMonroe, Georgetown—The
wildly inconsistent Hoyas have to rely
onMonroe inthepaint. ButMonroehas

. totakeamoreacﬁveroleinrebounding

andtakebettershots. With Monroe not
rebounding, the Hoyas won’t go any-

  

can (300) 643-Pl

  

where. In the last 10 games, six times
Monroehasfailedto notch doubledigit
rebound totals. The Hoyas lostallsix of
those games.
Teams NeedingW’ms _
Connecticut —-— The Huskies are in
trouble, especially after ahome loss to
Notre Dame. That gives the Huskies
a guaranteed losing record in the Big
East, despitewins againstupper-eche-
lon teams such as Texas," West Virginia

~ and Villanova. Beating top—tier teams

isn’t easy, but the Huskies should’ve
realized they can’t stink the rest of the
season and hopethesewins getthema
spot in the ﬁeld of 65.

Seton Hall —— An NCAA Tourna-
ment team needs a signature win to
reatﬁrmitsplaceintheﬁeld. Set.0nHall
has that, sort of. The Pirates beat Pitt
by three earlier in the year, but then
lostto Pittby 25 two Weeks later. Other

thanthatwin, and onesagainst me- N

diocre Louisville and Notre Dame, the
Pirates haven’t competed with other
top BigEastteams. The BigEasttourna-
ment could be a chance for the Pirates
to notchone, maybe two, solidifying
victories. P l V
SouthFlorida—.The Bulls beatthe

Pirates,whichinmybookshouldcount ,

for something. _I would argue they are
less on the bubble thanthe Pirates with
winsagainstPitt, Georgetown and two
close losses to Notre Dame. But their
nonconference schedule was as com-
petitive as playing 10 games against a
Pitt club team. They needto make itto
the third round to assertthemselves as
an NCAA Tournament team.

Tip-ins

Fourteen of the 16 teams in the Big
East have one or more players from
New York state. You didn’t think this
tournament was all about winning it
solely on the court, did you?

Mydark horse: Notre Dame. Why
not? It’s shooting the lights out, 46
percent from the ﬁeld, in its last three
games. Sometimes the hottest team
takes this tournament. ’
