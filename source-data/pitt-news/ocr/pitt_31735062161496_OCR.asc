Astronomy Professor
Finds. Truths In Buck
Rogers’ Air Antics

by DOROTHY CLELAND
Buck Rogers and his twenty-
ﬁfth century rocket antics may
prove in time to be a Jules
Vernian prediction of what is

to come.
to Keivin Burns, professor of
astronomy at the Allegheny Ob-
servatory, the idea of future trips
into space is not one to be scoffed
at. ‘

“The idea is not nearly so fan-
tastic as the wireless would have
been one hundred years ago,” said
Dr Burns, “because we know how
to make rockets today which will
work. ‘A’ hundred years ago there

wasn’t any idea at all about send-

ing messages by wireless.”
He explained that workable
rocket ships can be designed today

which would have enough power-

to take them completely away
from the earth’s pull of gravity;
so far away that they would never
come back “Of course,” he said,
“they still have the problem of
getting the ship back to earth. It

would have to come back at the '

same speed it left.”

Mere Supposition

The possibility of life similar to
ours ‘existing-I on other planets is
not so certain as some people would
have us believe, said Dr. Burns.
Some of the planets are too close
to the sun to sustain our type of
life, and the others too far away.
There may, however, be some
species of plant and some incon-
ceivable type of animal life that

do exist on some of these planets. ,

The type of work which Dr.
Burns is doing at the Observatory
cannot be measured by the work-
ing span of any man’s life. “We
work in programs here,” he ex-
plained. - “Right now we are
working on a program of stellar
observations which is to run two
hundred years.” They are plot-
ting the relative positions of the
stars. Observations are made at
different periods to determine just
how much the stars shift.

The solar observations equip-
ment at the Allegheny Observa-
tory, is one of only two such sets
to be found in the world. The
other, -which is at Mount Wilson
Observatory in California, is the
more complete of the two.

In commenting on the new 200-
inch telescope mirror which is be-
ing installed at Mount Wilson, Dr.
Burns said, “It will work much

faster than the hundred-inch; it

will get the same object in less
time. If it meets expectations, in
the same length of time it will get
objects double the distance away.
But whether or not it will bring
anything new into View can only
be determined by trying it.”

Pyrex Mirror

This mirror is made from pyrex ‘

glass; the hundred—inch was cast
of ordinary crown glass. It was

‘the pyrex which made such a huge

mirror possible. In spite of the
tedious delicate work required in
casting, cooling, cutting, and
transporting such huge lenses, he
believes that even larger mirrors
could be made today.

Although one would think that
Pittsburgh smoke would cause
much inconvenience at the Ob-
servatory, this is not the case.
“We usually get a wind here so
the smoke doesn’t bother us.
When there is smog there is no
wind. And when there is no wind,
there are clouds, so we could not
make observations anyway,” he
explained.

Deans Sponsor
Mixer Dance

Freshman, don’t despair; not
all of the events for February
newcomers are for women or men
only. For instance,- a freshman
mixer dance is being held in
Heinz House tomorrow from 3:30
to 5:30 o’clock, under the sponsor-
ship of the offices of the dean.of
men and the dean of women.

Special emphasis is placed on
the fact that new women transfer
students are also invited. Women
may obtain their tickets at the
dean of women’s, ofﬁce on the
twelfth ﬂoor; men at the dean of
men’s office on the eighth floor.

Music will be provided by Bob
Brown’s orchestra.

C&G Choral

Students wishing to be in the
choral group of Cap and Gown
should register at the Cap and
Gown oﬂice, 801 CL, some time
this week. Announcements for
vocal tests will be made in the
future. The singers’ chorus
'Will.be under the direction of
Theodore M. Finney, director of
the Men’s Glee Club.

Men’s Coiinci 
Reports Profit
Of Book Mart

Men’s Council Book Exchange
issued its ﬁnancial report today,
which showed that the Associa-
tion’s student loan fund would
gain $54’through last week’s activ-
ities of the textbook mart.

Robert Forsythe, C40, chairman
of the exchange, said that 250
books were sold during the week,
with the total amount of money
from the transaction being $360.
Of this $360, 15 per cent is de-
ducted to be added to the student
loan fund.

Last September, operating for
the ﬁrst time, the Exchange
handled around $370, contributing
$55 to the loan fund. The 250
books sold last week will result in
checks for 153 persons, said
Forsythe. Cards were mailed yes-
terday to the sellers, advising
them when to call at the dean of
men’s office in 809 Cathedral for
their checks.

The Council exchange has about
200 books left, which will be held
until the beginning of the Sep-
tember semester
change will reopen. Forsythe said
that books may be brought in any
time during the year to the dean
of men’s office. In addition, a col-

lection week will be held during
May.

H oeveler Announces Double

Feature ./it Druid Dance Today

I
‘elephants, nor even the most
colossal show on earth at the
Druid tea dance today,” admits
Jack Hoeveler, C40.

But, as president of the sopho-
more activities honorary, Hoevel-
er does «'ant’it known that he has
planned a double feature for to-
.day’s "affair. in the ballroom of
Hotel Schenley from 3 to 6 o’clock.

THREE TAPPEES

In addition to a ﬂoor show with
performers from last year’s Cap
;and Gown show and from the
§Freshman d.ance, I-loeveler an-
nounces that Druids “may” tap to
membership as many as three
ﬁrst-semester sophomores.

Furnishing music this afternoon
will be Anthony Edwards and his
' Rustlers, an orchestra which made
its campus debut at last semester’s
Cwen—Druid dance.

‘ Admission price is 25 cents per
.person.

Featured as vocalists for Hoev-

eler’s “ﬂoor show” are the “Three

“We won’t have a, parade of?“

Freshies,” who sang at the Fresh-
man Dance, and the sophomore
-swimmers’, quartet who sang as
“drugstore cowboys” in last year’s
Cap and Gown show.

“For some really swingy sing-
ing, every one of the ‘Freshies’ is .

ﬁrst-rate. And too many people
on campus already know that
those four Fifth Avenue boys,

can yodel as well as swim. This;
isn’t propaganda, either,” claims
I-Ioeveler.
INTERVIEIVS HELD

Interviewed yesterday by active I
Druids were first-semester sopho- I
mores who applied for tapping to
the activities honorary today. _
Minimum requirements for ad-{
mission were participation in at?
least three permanent activities
and a quality point average of,

‘I 3 Authors Satirize
‘I Dictators, Wars

T In New Musical

Once again Robert Saffron
and Nicholas Spanos, both
C38, authors of the 1936 Cap

and Gown Show ‘w‘_Out,_for the 

Count,” have produced aWpo-
litical satire in this year ’s Cap
and Crown Show, “Pickets,
Please!”

“Pickets, Please.!’." a take,-5
off on undeclared wars, dictator-
ships, and labor unions, was se-
lected at a meeting oflthe Gradu-
ate Capand Gown Club last Mon-
day night as the best student-
written script submitted for the
1938 show. Contrasting the strict-
ly American locale of the ﬁrst
Saffron-Spanos show, a satire on
the Townsend I plan, the plot of
this year’s show centers about a
central European dictatorship in
which a war is being waged un-
known to the people.

Commenting ' on the script,
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men and graduate manager of
Cap and G-own, said, “The grad-
uate committee is conﬁdent that
the show willbe even more enter-
taining than past Cap and Gown
productions, and will have a wide
appeal at this time.”

Directed by Gene Kelly, C34,
with the assistance of Carl Cass,

assistant professor of English and
director of Pitt Players, “Pickets,
Please!” will be presented at the
Nixon theater during the entire
week of April 4.

This morning saw the start of
the undergraduate subscription

campaign for the 1938 Owl, stu-
dent yearbook. ‘

With the senior subscription or-
der taking completed last Decem-
ber, Owl business manager Sam
Werlinich, BA38, opened the pun-
dergraduate campaign today,

The senior campaign this year
marks the most successful cam-
paign the Owl ever conducted,
surpassing last year’s sesquecen-
tennial recordﬂby 125 books. ,The'
Owl is to sell for $3.50,}: which
$1.50 is a down payment, the rest
being paid on receipt of the -book.’
PICTORIAL RECORD 1 I '

_ The 1938 Owlwill develop as a
pictorial record of the University
during the year. Today the Owl
has erected on the ground ﬂoor’ a

display consisting of a photomont-
rage made up of camera, shots of
University life. The photomont.—
age was made by’ the Hays'Aerial
Survey company and is,onep of the
largest of such ipictures repro-
duced by that company. The pho-
tomontage .is-to be presented in
two-tone coloring as the end-
sheets for the yearbook. ,  "

For the ﬁrst time in about ten
years the Owl stressed out-of-door
pictures, in’ what__ its . editor felt»
was an attempt to capture“freal

Sing Honors

With ‘Art For Art’s Sake’ Skit, 

By LOIS LOOMIS T '

Paying tributeito a true Pan-
hellenic girl, the Zeta Tau Alphas
won the Interfraternity sing held
Monday evening at Heinz. House.
“Art for Art’s _Sake',”‘smoothly

crooned the Zeta girls, who found

painting their way through college
just as upliftingas doing the big
apple——especially when college
was the picture and fraternity life
the frame.~ Dressed in smocks,
splashed vividly with color, and
wearing the -burlap variety of
painter’s cape, the eight artists
swung their buckets and ﬂourished
brushes to prove that the ultimate
in art is not a Tridelt’s picture, not
a Kappa’s nor a Theta’s, but the
fairest of them all——a composite
“Panhel” girl. Rosemary Lutz,
C39, was chairman of the winning
skit.

The skits for this annual event
sponsored by the Panhellenic As-
sociation offered a 1938 innova-
tion. Heretofore, no restriction to
theme or idea had been imposed.
This year the fraternities were
bound to‘ one general subject, that
of book titles.

Dr. Samuel Williams, professor
of biology, presiding over the
judges, presented the Zeta’s with
the bronze loving cup which will
become their permanent posses-
sion. Criteria for the award was

based on a scale which valued or-
iginality, cleverness, and spirit, 30
per cent. The gift of warbling,
counted only ten per cent. _"

Because the judges’ decisions
were not unanimous,.two honora-
ble mentions were also awarded to
the Phi Sig’s and Delta Zeta’s.‘ '

“The Nile,” by Ernile',Ludw,ig,
gave the Egyptian maidens (Phi
Sigma’s to you) a the-meof swing
and sway alluring enough to cap-
tivate any judge. Butthe maidens
weren’t the “wow” of history that
their queenie Cleopatra managed
to be. So Cleo, the glamour girl,
took pity on he-r very plain sisters
who had tried everything from
Fred Allen’s Ipana toothpaste’ to
Dorothy Dix, and gave them her
magic formula for success. “Go
sorority,” sang Anne" Helfgott, and
the maidens, convinced “they need
sorority,” vision romance . just
around the corner. .Ruth Rosen-
thal, C38, was chairman‘ of the
skit_. , , '

The Delta Theta’s chose a melo- ,
drama, “Love is Enough.” The
villain was all for putting out the
symbolic lamp of Delta Theta
whick ﬂickered feebly in the light-
house. But in the end, the good
ship Panhellenic (which would
surely have crashed against the
rocks on such a deep, dark night)
was saved.  '

ysis, publication of the Institute of Propaganda
Analysis, located in New York.

The AAUP-Bulletin considered it worth the
space in. presenting it to college professors.
The--Pitt‘ News cons_iders it worth the space in
quot_i_iig excerpts for the people who read The
News". .

‘,‘V_Ve.can recognize propaganda when we see

it if weare familiar with the seven common
propaganda devices. These are . . .
_ ‘.“_ ‘;Name calling’ is a device to maks us form
a judgment without examining the evidence on
which it is based. Here the propagandist ap-
peals -to our hate and fear. He does this by
giving ‘bad names’ to those individuals, groups
natioiis, races, policies, practices, beliefs, and
ideals, which he would have us condemn and
reject-. . .

“For example_ the Hearst press applies bad
names to Communists and Socialists. Those
who want to change the status quo apply bad
names tovthose who would maintain it. For
example, the Daily Worker and the American
Guardian apply bad names to conservative Re-
publicans and Democrats.

“ ‘Glittering Generalities’ is a device by
wliich the propagandist identiﬁes his program
with virtue by use of ‘virtue words.’ Here he
appeals to our emotions of love, generosity, and
brotlierliood. He uses words like truth, free-
dom, honor, liberty . . . democracy, the Amer-
ican way . . .

“As Name Calling is a device to maks us

form avjudginent to reject and condemn, with-’*v

out examining the evidence, Glittering Gener-
alities is a device to maks us accept and'a.p-
prove, without examining the evidence .

‘Transfer’ is a device by which the pro-
pagandist carries over the authority, sanction_
and prestige of something we respect and
revere to something he would have us to ac-
cept . . . -

“ ‘Testimonial’ is a device to make us accept
anything’ from a patent medicine or a cigarette
to a program of national policy. In this de-
vice, the pr'opaga.ndist uses t.est‘iinonia.ls . . . This
d_evice_ works in reverse, also? hounter—testi-
nionials may be employed . . .

“‘Pla_in.Fo1ks.’ is_ a device used by poli-

ticiansglabor lea’ders,,business men, and .even_..

by ministers and educators to win our, con-

ﬁidence jby. appearing to be people like .,our-_

selves-‘just plain folks among the neigh-
bors’ . . .

“ ‘Card Stacking’ is a device in which the
propagaiidist employs all the arts of deception
to win our support for himself, his group, na-
tion, policy, practice, belicf, or ideal.

“He stacks the cards against the "truth. He
uses under-emphasis and over-emphasis to
dodge issues and evade facts. He resorts to

lies_ censorship, and distortion.

“He omits facts. He offers false tcstiinony.
He creates a smoke screen of clamor by rais-
ing a new issue when he wants an embarrassing
matter forgotten. He draws a red herring
across the trail to confuse and divert those in
quest of facts he does not want revealed  .

“ ‘The Band ‘Nagoii’ is a device to make us
follow. the crowd; to accept the propagandist’s
program en masse. Her-he‘ his theme is: ‘Every-
body ’s doing it.’ . . . He employs symbols, col-

As we remarked above, we are reprinting
these excerpts because we think them valuable
per se. The intention ‘of the article, as re-
printed in the Bulletiii, was, no doubt, to'sug—
gest’ “a few t'lii‘nfgs” to the reading members.
VVe have the same purpose. 7‘ ‘ '

But, before we leave off, we would add an
eightli device to the list. V‘/Te_.,:VV’0l1lCl call it
the “But That ’s _a Lot of Propaganda’-’ device.
The people who employ this device will not be
reading with us. or, if they-are, they only will
grant that‘ this is an interesting‘discussion. But
that it is l0gica1,,tli‘cy will_‘-not admit.

Baker, BeetIe,_BottIe . . .

Typical radio cleverness is provided by Phil
Baker, with Beetle ‘and Bottle (Sunday,'7:30l p. m.,
WJAS). At present they are doing a series of de-
tective plots, with mysterious murders and obvious
jokes. Unusual, to say the least, is the method of
presenting commercial plugs. They are ‘written
around popular songs, and really are easy on the
ears. '

During a spurt of simplicity, this column started
to listento several children’s programs, and found
them more interesting than some of their sophisti-
cated rivals. Exceptional, from the. standpoint of
both story and music, is Our Barn (Saturday, 11:30
a. m., KDKA). Attendance records of “Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs” reveal that this type
of show has a deﬁnite appeal to grown—ups. The
young actors give truly professional performances.

The Singing Lady . . .

Although it is listed as a children’s program,
(Monday-Friday, 5:30 p. m., KDKA), the Singing
Lady’s stories attract a wide following among
grown-up persons. And it’s all because the Sing-
ing Lady knows how to tell a story. She changes
her voice to represent the different parts; she
dramatizes some of the incidents, and she keeps the
plot moving rapidly.

Ted Epstein, over WCAE, is a top-notch Pitts-
burgh announcer. Ted took his bachelor’s degree
from the University in 1928, and was graduated
from the Law School in 1931. The fact that he was
a member of Men’s Debating Association during his
college days may help to account for his excellent
speaking voice.

if the element’ of time is con-

sidered (as it must be in any his-‘

“criminality” reveals itself.

In the world today there exists

the'Unii;ed States; Russia may or

This novel by Mr. Paul is not

the war came. All that was good

Eulalie was blasted away by the
force and hate of war. And it is
this contrast between the peace-
time Santa Eulalie and the blasted
remnants of the town after the
war had left it that Mr.

The bare outline of the action
of the book allows for no indica-

avoids the sticky sentimentality of

Hockey Finally Comes
Into Its Own

Leonard Levison

Mental notes taken while covering the recently-extended

zsports beat that now expands from the ramshackle track house,

itself being one of many debateless facts for a Pitt ﬁeld house,
winds. around the Stadium to Gate 3, and then breezes down
Ba.yardiS,treet to Johnny Harris’ Craig Street winter play-

. ground.

The Harris Hanger now houses the hottest thing in the un-

_ _ . .\
dergraduate winter stove c1rcu1t‘,'

. . . that being the Ohio-Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate Hockey
League . . whose leading citizen
is now John McSorley who

in turn has developed the Panth-er

hockey team into the skate outfit

.that seems secure in the Eastern

Division’s top notch . . .

',‘Team Has Spirit f

It was only a" year ago’ that Bob

‘lschooleyi got a bunch of the boys
‘together and had them agree to

get-up at 6 o’clock in the morning

"to practice so that Pitt might have

a hockey team . they played
and lost two games during the first
season of this Renaissance . i.
‘now they have regular practice
hours at other times than in the
middle of the night . . . and with it
they have a championship team, it
is believed, parti-cularly by
the boys themselves‘. . . who
determined
. . their play in the several
games just , completed has con-
vinced’ a’ good many ofvthe citi-
zens that theyare justiﬁed in that
way of thinking . . .

Hockey started again this sea-
son solely on the initiative of the
boys, who talked Johnny Harris
into giving them time on the ice
. . . Harris, unquestionably pos-
sessing. a ‘good business head, soon
liad*the- collegiate league idea for-
mulated. . . he offered the Gar-
de‘n,“1ef—t« the collegiate oﬂicials
toiworkve out the details . . . and is
nowable to provide standingroom
only for the latecomers to the
weeklycollege double-headers . . .

Mcsorley Does Well-

Johnny lVlcSorley, the real estate
mogul,,has done a swell job of
whipping out a potential champion
. . . he has drilled the Panthers
into a smooth-working te-am . .

,In giving out the credit for the
success thus far of the hockeyers,
lVlcSorley’s coaching genius, and
Harris’ business acumen in fur-
thering the sport should both be
given their just considerations . . .
but the basic cause, and in this
case, the overshadowing-all-else
reason is the enthusiasm of the
boys themselves.

Conference play for the Pan-
thers is just half over . . . every
team in the circuit has played its

scheduled game in the Stadium
Pavilion . . the remaining con-
tests . for Carlson’s not-yet-elimin-
ated cagers will all be ﬁgure-
eighted out on floors that are any-
thing but home for Captain J ohn.-
son and his mates . .

Owls Best Players

From observation of the Confer— .

ence members we have come to
the conclusion that the‘ "Temple
Owls,’ sooner or later, will hang
the plaque up in old Philadelphia
this year . . .- this induction re-
quired no master-minding" . . .
Temple, at this writing has a sub-
stantial grip on ﬁrst place .. . .
with its remaining games to be
played on the Philadelphia hard»-
woods . . upon. which it hasn’t
as yet been beaten. . .

But, its relative position’ with

regard‘ to its Conference broth-

ers, is just as it should be . . .
Ji*mrny' Usilton has in Black,
Shields, B-loom, Henderson, and

Boyle the best bunch of ball play-

ers in the league . . against Pitt
they appeared only good enough
to win . . . having just ﬁnished
four games days . . . which,
with;-‘basketball as it:is played to-
day . .— . is mdre -than just a long,
tough grind . . 7. even-at that time
their wearied potentialities were
evident . . . T

Lawther Praised
In» selecting the best coached

team that has appeared here, we-

palm the.~awa_'rd to Johnny Law-
ther’s Penn State deliberators . . .
whether it’sthe unchanging Law-
there type of play or whether, it’s
the Lawth_er. "adaptation. to the
new rules, ‘the, fact remains that
Lawther’s teamplayed the smart-
est ball . . . their deliberate meth-
od .of attack is the best way of
meeting the no-tip rule . . . they
are enabled to pick up a few need-
ed breaths by placing men in the
corners while-the outer three work
around with the ball . . .

Also may we again express our
admiration of “Gentleman Jim”
Lawther, who contributed the ﬁn-
est bit of sportsmanship that we
have seen on the Stadium ﬂoor
this winter when he stopped his
team’s offense at a crucial point
to enable injured Captain Johnson
of Pitt to be cared for.

The Garden Again
Woodruff,”Ryde-n, Relayers To Run
In New York AC Games

This Saturday the aces of

the Pitt track team will once

again stride around New York’s Madison Square,Garden dur-
ing the New.York A C. meet in an attempt to catch up with
some of the preseasonexpectations.

Earlier in the season some of the Panther men partook of

the Millrose games atithe same?

Garden, and failed to make an i1n—
pression. They made an impres-
sion, but not the kind you write
home about.

MASON MAY'.GO

The contingent that will accom-
pany Olson: to New York is still
undecided. Johnny Woodruff, Ken
Ryden, Frank. Ohl, Allen McKee
and Al Ferrara who made the trip
to the Millrose games, will likely
make the '~ trip 1 again. Captain
Dick Mason,‘ sprinter, may get a
chance to glimpse'Manhattan be-
tween sprints.

Olson will make the ﬁnal selec-
tions today. The squad may be
augmented by a weightman. The
cindermen will be chosen on their
showings in the University Cham-
pionship meet and practice ses-
sions.

This year’s New York A. C. is
the seventieth anniversary of the
first indoor track meet ever held
in the country. Twenty-three
events are scheduled, and thus far
all the Millrose winners and other
track top—notchers have entered
the meet.

BEETHAM ENTERED

Johnny Woodruﬁ will face his
favorite nemisis in the 880 run.
Charlie Beetham, who led Wood-
ruff to the tape in the Millrose
games will try to do a little dupli-
cating of that feat. Ross Bush, a
Paciﬁc Coasthalf miler, is another
threat for the half-mile crown.

Pitt’s mile‘ relay team will have
to do some fast stepping to match
strides with the -quartets: from
Manhattan, Fordham, and N; Y. U.
These three New York teams are
the speediest in the country.’-«

Panther Icers,
Yellow Jackets
Meet Thursday

Things are looking very much
up for John McSorley,"Pitt hockey
coach, and his pace-setting icers.
At the present they are basking
in the light of a four game win-
ning streak with the immediate
prospects of stretching it into ﬁve
games.

Tomorrow they entrain for
Cleveland to meet Baldwin-Wal-
lace. Baldwin-Wallace has not
given too much opposition to
league teams and doesn’t promise
too much trouble for the Blue and
Gold.

Mcsorley intends to start the
same line-up that has provided
the ﬁreworks for their string of
victories, Dick Friday at center;
Schooley and Britton, wings; Broi-
da and Lovett, defense; and Bud
Ellis goalie.

To back this fast skating ﬁrst
line Mcsorley has Paul.Kennedy;
who has dropped all signs of his
recent illness and ’will be ready
for action against B-W. Bob
Lowe, defense star, ineligible the

past few games may. also break"

into the fray along with Irv Artz.

The injection of any .- of these;
men inrthe line-up takes nothing ‘

away from Pitt and company in
the way of scoring.strength.'.

Captain Ralph Caruso, the hard
luck 135-pounder will be a great

foes. Ralph, after a start which
featured a knockout, andsa deci-
sion, lost two very questionable
decisions to his Syracuse and
Temple opponents.

Jed Curzi, the Butler dread-
naught, is expected to return to the
form which saw him win all his
bouts at the beginning of the sea-
son. The Pitt mentor won't" lose
any sleep worrying about the 155
class after the show Ray Bombe
put on last Friday. P Ray, subbing
for the injured. Ventrusca, kayoed
his-Temple opponent. -

Work horse Ashmann, will be
plugging away at the 165 division
and will be ready to keep up the
consistent work which has helped
the Pitt team up to where it is.

George Lupinnacci has been
holding down the 175 post and
from all indications is expected
to hold his own against Penn State
and Catholic U.

The heavyweight division has
been giving Coach Shricker con-
siderable trouble. There has been
no regular heavyweight represen-
tative. Ted Schmidt, and Bill
Hickmann have been battling dur-
ing the last two weeks.

In their inaugural bout of the
current season, the Pitt yearling
boxers will encounter the East
Liberty team at the latter’s home
ﬂoor tonight. Among the more
promising freshies are Speigal and
Spence. Speigal is a 125—pounder
and Spence a 145-pounder. Sev-
eral . weight divisions. on the
Freshman team are poorly repre-
sented.

‘World Is Crazy’

Says Dr. Clausen
At Student Forum

BY ROBERT ADAMS

“W'e ’re living in a World that
is crazy. It ha.s to be changed
——and we’re the people to
change it.”

That is the conclusion which
Dr. Bernard C. Clausen, pastor
of the First Baptist church,
reached at Inquiry Forum,
Monday, in his address on “Bei
Mir Bist Du Schoen,” with varia-
tions.

Speaking before an overﬂow
crowd in 129 Cathedral, Dr. Clau-
sen declared his belief that the
present economic system was ser-
iously maladjusted, with the pro-
moters of enterprise, not the
achievers, getting the rewards.

3-POINT PROGRAM

Suggesting three points through
which some present-day condi-
tions might be bettered, Dr. Clau-
sen affirmed his faith that there
is a “hope for achieving a more
decent sanity in America day by
day.” His proposals were:

1. People should take every

V legitimate step to assure that peo-

ple at the bottom of the ﬁnancial
scale should get greater rewards
than they receive at present.

2. Acting as intelligent people,
we should remember the things
that are important to us, in order
to direct our decisions correctly.

3. Americans should erect in,

their lives a different stazfidard of
success than the criterion79‘o:E 
terial possessions. _   _ _'
“The simple reward of social
justiﬁed achievement,”., siggges.

Dr. Clausen, “should 

absolutely meaningless, 

     
  

A  ors “of i“iBei,: ,« _
I ,” =who received

for me you are beautiful,’ ex-
presses the essence of truereligious
reaction.
5‘: “Everybody’s- getting rich out
of the song—-everybody except the
two. little forgotten men who
dreamed it into being a few years
ago. Asa general rule, the great
rewards come to the lucky gamb-
lers,” complained Dr. Clausen,

“In Pittsburgh,” he continued,
“there are 225 remaining million-
aires. ' In Pittsburgh there are also
225 of the worst slum blocks of
the world, and most of those 225
slum blocks are owned by the 225
millionaires.”

counting department, it was an-
