Swanson Seeks Change  

To °Democratize’ Vote

A proposed constitutional amendment that would do away with
“sex segregation” in Student Congress elections brought’ on a
raging battle at the body's meeting yesterday.

Political alignments that have existed-since last fall's open-
ing session shattered as a faction led by Ray Maher, Don Wilde,’
and Pat Leix successfully resisted the efforts of Bill Swanson

Heat Plant
Assured

Coal Supply

School doors will definitely be

open all next week. Elmer Hal-’

Vorsen heating superintendent for
all university buildings, said
Fridaythat enough coal has been
acquired to guarantee a full
week’s supply.

The Bellefield Boiler Plant
which heats the school's buildings
had 14 box-cars on hand Friday

afternoon, containing in all about
700 tons of coal.

Coal Consumption Great

Average daily consumption at
the plant is about a car and a half
or 75 tons. On very cold days ap-
proximately two cars are con-
sumed.

Dr. John Weber, University sec-
retary, revealed that there is an
auxiliary gas furnace in the Ca-
thedral which could be used in

. case of a drastic heat curtailment.

Halvorsen said the gas-burner is
not capable of heating the whole
Cathedral. "It could provide
enough heat for domestic water
and some heat to offices, but it \
wouldn't be able to dolany more
than take the chill off the whole
building.”

Rumors Everywhere

Pitt was not the only school
plagued by rumors of a shutdown.

Exchange papers from several
Mid-West schools show students
there are indulging in the same
speculations. The Ohio State"Lan-
tern on Feb. 21 carried a request
by the school's utilities superin-
tendent which asked all students
and faculty to help conserve elec-
tricity because of dwindling coal
supplies. _ _

Shrinking stock piles at Michi-
gan State have left the Spartans
with only a two-week’s supply.
President’ John Hannah termed
talk of a complete shut down"scut-
tlebutt,’,’ however. He denied the
possibility of any suspension of
classes. _ ,

Greenhouse experiments at .M1_Ch-
igan State which have been going
onifor 10 to 15 years were assured
protection from ruinous freezing
conditions. ‘

Still Echoing
Editorially‘

Echoes of the Phi Kappa frater-
nity parking-sparking disagree
ment aretstill rolling in. j

The boys were taken to court
last September to answer charges
of necking and noise making in

their ‘back yard parking lot on
complaints made by annoyed
neighbors,

Judge A. Marshall Thompson,
who presided over the case, made
his decision on Jan. 3 to the
effect that the Phi Kaps would be
limited to daytime parking only.

With a bit of point stretching,
an Ohio State editorialist inter-
preted the decision this way:

“The judge, obviously a wise
and benevolent man, threw the
case out of court. He realized, of
course," that the "loud talk”
charge was preposterous.”

H-Bomlfsilmplications Topic
For Eliot’s Thursday Talk

The I-l-Bomb, one of the most hotly-discussed topics of the
day, will come under consideration Thursday at 2:30 p.m. when
Major George. Fielding Eliot steps to the speaker’s platformin

Stephen Foster, Memorial.
Major Eliot will discuss the
tions of the Hydrogen Bomb.

As a CBS broadcaster during the
war, he became president of the
Association of Radio News Ana-
lysts. His columns in the New
York Herald-Tribune have been
syndicated nationally. And now
he is lecturing, in addition to
working on a new series of radio
broadcasts on the Hydrogen bomb.

Major Eliot's visit to Pitt is a
timely one. Just last week Dr. David
Bradley told a Foster Hall aud-
ience that a world government of-

. fered the only hope for peace.

He comes before the students of
Pitt with over twenty years ex-

perience in analyzing and report-
ing military and international
policy.

Since 1928, Major Eliot has re-
ported to the American people on
national security in five mediums of
communication. He has written
seven books including “If Russia
Strikes" published last year. ‘His.
magazine articles have appeared
in "Life," "Harper’s” and other
national publications. . ’

Communist

The possibility that the Com-
munist Party has worked its way
into the University was raised this
week by Matthew Cvetic.

Cvetic, former FBI undercover
agent is now testifying before the
House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee in Washington. Under sub-
poena to the Congressional Com-
mittee, Cvetic is unable at present
to reveal more of his facts than
have already been published.

In a letter to the News, Cvetic
wrote, however, "When I return to
Pittsburgh I will be very glad to
discuss  Communist Party infil-
tration at the University.”

Through a telegram, the News
asked Cvetic to enlarge on his
testimony in which he placed the

, the name of Dr‘. Ma‘rioln‘l-Iathway,

  

professor in the graduate School of
Social Work, among those mention-
ed in his testimony thus far.

Cvetic replied, "I believe it is
J fair to add here that I testified in
executive session on the person
you mentioned (Dr. Hathway) and,
while I have attended_many acti-
vities within the framework of the
Progressive Party with this per-
son, I had no knowledge of her
attending Communist Party meet-
ings or of being a member of the
Communist Party.”

There have been no present mem-
bers of the Communist "Party in the
Pitt student body or on the faculty
revealed in Cvetics public testi-
mony.

‘During his testimony Cvetic also

 

mentioned ,aV.won1an,whom he ident-

That Space Problem Again

The University, which always has been interested in giving
the students something to. do in‘their spare time by encouraging
activities, now apparently is willing to supply the spare time.

Helen Pool Rush, dean of women, has proposed an adjustment
in the class-hour schedule to free all students for an hour and a
half, from 12:30 to 2 p.m. each day, for utilization as an activity
period, much as many of our high schools do.

Certainly we, as an activity, and other activity leaders would
be among the first to back such an idea. All school activities have
suffered at one time or another from the restrictions worked in
 trying to find a suitable time for concentrated work.Everyone free
at the same time for a 11/2-hour period would alleviate much of
this.

, However, those who investigate the proposal would do well
if ‘to focus their study on a question the idea suggests. What are
_you going to do with all these students on the loose at the same
— time? ' -

* * * * III *

    
 

At least until the expansion program transforms blueprints
into buildings, we certainly don’t have the room or facilities
handy to handle the mob of free students. There aren’t enough
activities now,’ not enough of the students interested in activity
participation. And we definitely don’t have the facilities to take
care of them, at least not until the planned Student Center is
constructed. t .

Naturally, most of the students will use this free time to eat.
When we visualize the present student body trying to get into the

two little Tuck Shops and the cafeteria all at once, we shudder.
This will also hold true for all other of our present facilities that
are used when the student has time off from classroom work.
Such a proposal would be a boon to activities. Of that there
is little doubt. This advantage offsets one complaint that tends
‘ to arise, that is, when such a period is inserted into the sche-
dule, it will probably keep the average student in school a little
later each day.

An ideal situation would have to exist, and it wouldn’t often,
for a student to get an all-morning schedule. All others would
necessarily be kept here until mid-afternoon to finish their school
day. This again would work to the advantage of activities. So
long as the space requisites are takencare of.

A New Joe College?

By DICK KOVAR
Pitt News Managing Editor

At the risk of ‘getting beaten up by various and sundryiex-
GI’s, I’d like to take a crack at an idea that has become prac-
tically an institutihgi in the field of higher education, namely, the

' ‘sober, serious veteran ”

eral public.

myth built up by educators and the gen-

Certainly, there were and are a
lot of vets studying under the GI
Bill who concentrated on their
studies as few of their earlier, less
mature counterparts had done before
the war. It was these students who
forced professors to go back to
their textbooks and revise 20-year-
old lecture notes to keep up with
their classes.

On a percentage basis, however,
the contrast isn't so great. With a
larger enrollment, the number of
honor students naturally rises. This
mathematical fact, plus the increas-
ed age and matuirty of the veteran
students, did bolster grade aver-
ages and library attendance figures
to a record high.

So the professors looked around
their institutions at the khaki-
shirted backs bent over books,then
hastened out to proclaim their dis-
covery to the public via press re-
leases and magazine articles.

Fitzgerald, who is head of the Pittsburgh Parking Authority.
Dr. Fitzgerald has held the chairmanship of this group since

the person of Chancellor Rufus

July 1947, and though there have
been ' many improvements since then,
there is still room for a great many
more.

Perhaps wecould use a system
now 'in_ _operation at some other
universrties around the country.
Tags with the name of the school
are issued to e_ach student and
designated areas are set up for
student parking.

This would eliminate some of
the congestion caused by down-
town shoppers who park their cars
in the Schenley Park lot and then
take a trolley to town.

It seems that the sorority gals
really unsheathed their claws in
the just-past rushing fracas. From
the information‘ we have, there were
not enough potential sorority wo-
men available who were eligible
(a 1.0 average is necessary). Well
it’s nice that the fur has stopped
flying and some of the actives can
go around with ‘their eyes open
again.

It looks like the ADPi’s, who
rushed Dr. John M. Ferguson of
the economics department, got the
best pledge of all. His pledge pin
consists of a paper clip rampant
on a dark blue suit.

Just looking over some of the
classes is a good way to discover
that many students fall into typed

categories.

For instance there is a brain who
delights in flaunting his knowl-
edge by asking the prof questions
like: "Washington was our first
president, wasn't he?” All this
joker wants is to have the guy in
charge know that he knows what
there is to know.

Then‘ there's the female literary
student of 50 plus, who is so ex-
cited by the literature she is study-
ing. She gushes all over the pro-
fessor, takes up all the class time
and in general, makes everyone
wonder why she is there.

Of course, no collection would
be complete without the femme
fatale. Her main object in class is’
to get the harassed male in the
front of the room so interested in
her obvious Charms that he won’t
notice that she ‘don’t know nothin’
about nothin.'

Her opposite is the dapper Casa-
nova who exercises his wiles on
the poor, young lady instructor. If
the instructor happens to be a
male, this character will operate
on anything feminine in sight.

With so many different kinds of
people running around loose in the
Cathedral, it isn't hard to pick
out many more. Other sketches
will appear in subsequent "over-
set” columns.

ern version of Joe College, the

Bill was endued with a burning
thirst for knowledge, an insatiable
appetite for education, and a lofty
scorn for ‘typical campus frivolity.'

A noble figure, GI Bill.Except
that, for the most part, he didn’t
exist.

Ask the bartenders at the Gold
Bar, the Greek’s, at Ben's Place-
Ask the beat cops that had to roll
them off Soldiers and Sailors Mem-

some of the frat boys about the

rest of the month, or about the
ones who used to take off on the
spur of the moment and drive to
Steubenville or Wheeling for the
week.

Then his first check arrived.
After that it was a toss-up whether
he showed up plastered or failed
to come to class at all.

I don’t mean to condemn or even
criticize G. 1. Bill. He was, and
still is, ifl"every way the best stu-
dent to hit Pitt or a.ny other school.
It’s just time that people in general
got a truer picture of him, since he
won't be around much longer.

Frankly, the colleges and uni-
versities owe a lot to his influence.
They'll miss more than his tuition
when he finally passes from the
campus scene.’

I remember well a GI I’d known
in high school_who turned up in my
freshman poli.sci. class. vying for
high ex-am grades. We outlined the
text before class, did outside read-
ing, and rarely came up with more

than one wrong answer on the
quizzes. .

Pitt News

Recent interest in Independents
at Pitt, as shown by the last three

~ issues of the News, prompts this

letter. That such an organization
operates on Campus and is attempt-
ing to_ plan social functions and
sponsor cultural affairs should be
made known to the Student Body.
The Pitt Independent Association
will make the non-fraternity-sorority
Pittite’s school stay a socially
pleasant one, active and rewarding.
By dances, card parties, square
dances and a picnic, we hope to
achieve this. Other efforts to pro-

terests include plans for participa-
tion in the Spring Festival and

‘Ingrid Bergman's future is cert-
ainly assured despite her -er -ah
indescretion if she still has enough
loyal friends like Tom Nicholson
of The Michigan State News.

In a. recent editorial defending
the errmg actress, whom Nicholson

remembers as a popular pin-up
girl in " a lot
girl in "a lot of barracks,” he

asks the question why Ingrid is
not “entitled to fall in love and
bear a child like any other normal
human being without the whole
world looking in her window, attach-
ing a label of unacceptance on her
child and putting undue importance
on something that is her affair
alone?”

.Normul’ Woman?

Nicholson’s acceptance of Ingrib
as a “normal” woman invites con-
siderable speculation on our part
as to the nature of his feminine
acquaintances and causes us to
ponder, “how abnormal can you
get?”

The Michigan State editor goes
_on to sympathize with Rossellini
the father. who was "driven to the
point of hanging camermen over the
head with their equipment in an

effort to be left alone.”

We fondly hope, for the sake of
Nicholson's seemingly ill-equipped
cranium, that when and if he
chooses to make journalism his
life’s work, he does not meet with
too many Rossellinis on interview

assignments.
In an emotional outburst of mag-
nanimous pity he exclaims, “I

feel sorry for Ingrid, I feel sorry
for Rossellini. I feel very sorry
for the baby. But most of all"I
feel sorry for the American press
that has to depend on this sort of
sordid business to sell papers and
for the American public whose
reading habits and mentality de-
mand that their daily newspapers
fmnt-page this type of ‘news’.”

We can only feel deep sympatl._
for this immature crusading knight
in this Quixotic interpretation of
the Champion's role.

He so inexpertly wields his
journalistic sword that he turns it
against his own allies, the ever-
suffering readers, and only manages
to lop off the hand that feeds him.

  Public Education Needs
L Publicity, Says Goslin

By GEORGE BARBOUR

An effective public relations program carefully planned by the

public school is the cornerstone for a dynamic educational system,
Willard Goslin, superintendent of schools at Pasadena, California
said Thursday evening at the University.

The lecture was sponsored by the University's School of Ed-

ucation
‘ Educate the Public I

"The only way to build an ef-
fective school system is by inte-
grating the public attit-ude ,with
that of the school board," he de-
clared while addressing the third
session of Tri-State Area School
Study Council.

The title of Mr. Goslin’s speech
was “The School Board and Public
Relations.” He believed that the
school board should encourage the
community and all school personnel
to take an active interest in the
school system.

“There must, however, be no
exclusion of the great fabric of
people who make up the commun-
ity,” he emphasized. “The natural
inclination is to gear the school
program to a segment of the people,
but it must be geared to the man in
the street.”

sonnel activity in establishing a
sound educational system which
would "develop the individual citi-

“Even the janitor should know
what type of education he is sweep-

The noted educator said it was

“In our schools, the rise and
fall of the Roman Empire is studied
for -three months, but the rise and
fall of the American school system
is not studied for three hours.”

Teachers Considered

Also, Mr. Goslin stated that we
must change our attitude towards
the teachers. They should not be

treated like "maids” he said, but
be shown that they too have a stake
in the school system. The school
board should do more than just
“scratch the surface” of parent-
teacher conference. He pointed
out that seldom are parents seen
at the public schools.

Panther Mimics ‘Life ’;
Makes Debut Tomorrow

The Panther’s “Life Issue” finally makes its debut tomorrow

after a nine-day delay.

’ Late publication was due, according to Editor Bob McKowen,
to "advertising contracts and the confusion of sorority rushing

week.”

Several of this issue's features
were disclosed, but Panther staff
members were silent as to the cover
design. McKowen’s only comment
was: “It’s great.”

Another surprise for Panther
readers, says photographer Fran
Nestler, is the staff's choice of a
"replacement for Rita.”

This issue, styled after a nat-
tional magazine, features "Speak-
ing of Pictures,” I:etters to the
Editors, and an explanation of bas-
ketball rules.

Several -Panther features, ac-
cording to Managing Editor Don
Horowitz, "are currently running in
a national magazine by a rather
odd coincidence,” such as a sneak

Students, Faculty Blend
At Third Lemon Blennd

By JAMES RUSSO
One thing certain about the third Lemon Blennd held in Room
1201 on Feb. 22 -3- George Washington could never have slept there,
not even if he were a heavy sleeper. A

The steady chatter of some 60 student and faculty’ voices would

have given him a slight case of insomnia.

However, at least 15 minutes
slipped away before students and
faculty intermingled to any great
degree. This delay prompted one
faculty member to remark, "I won-
dered when the students would
be gin blending.”

Brit blend they did and once the
verbal ball got rolling, it was hard
to stop.

Of course they did take time out
from their informal getting-acquainb
ed sessions to consume several
dozen cookies and nearly three
gallons of the tasty lemon blennd.

Another brief intermission was
called while Anatalie Gefesky, a
Pitt Player, presented a skit por-
traying the humor and pathos of
freshman registration.

In addition to an almost unre-

BS’ LEN BAKER
3 Peter Zachary Lloyd, clerk of
the general assembly of Pennsyl-
vania, signed his name and passed
the pen to Thomas Mifflin, speaker
of the house, who also affixed his
signature. The date was Feb. 28,
The time was 163years ago.
,The occasion was the establish-
ing of what was to become the _

  

University of Pittsburgh.

In 1787 the, Pennsylvania General

Assembly decided to subsidize an
academy in Pittsburgh to teach
W -"the learned languages, English
and Mathematicks.” The students
were not permitted _to "wear a dirk
(not a dink) or carry a weapon.’’
3 The Assembly’s decision was
mainly due to the agitation of Hugh
Henry Brackenridge, who was one
of the “first to recognize the com-
S mercial possibilities of the frontier
... (and) also one of the earliest to
establish its culture.”

Pittsburgh Ideal Spot

2 Brackenridge’ felt that Pittsburgh
 was the ideal situation for the Aca-
tldemy because of "the fine aire, the
,,excellent water, the plenty and
cheapness of provisions.”

2 The air and the water of Pitts-
’ burgh have changed for the worse
1 since his time, but the University’s
2 change has not been in the same
direction. _

if Starting in a two-story log cabin
: at Grant St. and Cherry Alley where
20 students were housed, the Aca-
demy gradually developed from the
Pittsburgh Academy to the Western
University of Pennsylvania and
, finally to the Univers_ity of Pitts-
burgh.

The original log school has been
3 replaced by 21 major buildings
“ covering 90 acres and including 20
schools. The present property value
of the University is estimated at
20.5 millions.

Brackenridge’s plea for the school
embodied three arguments: 1) Pitts-
burgh’s location was "healthful
and economical,” 2) Pittsburghers

wanted an academy and deserved
one for their services during the
Revolution, and 3) such an aca-
demy would produce leaders for
governing the state.

» Began as Private School

The academy was established as
a private school of higher learning
with the state ready to aid’ if nec-
essary, according to established
-precedent.

Opposition arose because Brack-
ernidge’s plan for the charter would
allow more than one denomination
to attend the Academy. His retort
placed an individual’s religion
alongside of “the clothes he wore
the last time I saw him” in regards
to the school.

He felt that those “in future
cases would elect successors with-
out regard to distinction of religious
denomination” to serve on the
board of trustees.

Brackenridge’s dream has been in
a continual state of growth both in
size and purpose. Until the end of
the 19th century the University
emphasized collegiate and engineer
ing training. In the 1890’s a number
of professional schools became af-
filiated with the University.

Twenty students attended the
the Academy’s first class. Twelve
hundred students were attending in
1910 and now Pitt houses more than
20,000.

Now Underway

Fraternities began formal rush-
ing yesterday, according to frat-
ernity advisor Lestor Braileyu

During formal rushing, the frat-
ernities entertain prospective mem-
bers with meals and activities. This
year’s rushing differs in several
respects from previous semesters.

Rushees will be given more op-
portunity to visit the houses. Din-
ners were served yesterday and will
be given again on Tuesday, Wed-
nesday, and Friday of next week.
In addition, stag affairs will be
held on Wednesday of both weeks,
and stag or date events on each
Friday.

All the organizations have agreed
to schedule the same type of in-
formal dance on Saturday, March
4, to encourage the pledges to
visit other houses.

A formal dance will mark the end -.
of rushing on Saturday, March 11.

From March 12 to March 120 is
the "silence period” when no con-
tact between fraternities and pled-
ges is permitted. At this time,
fraternity bids are entered and ac-
cepted or rejected.

Theta Chi’s

Foul Shots
Beat Kaps

Though keen shots and fast
breaks were two for a nickel, it
was foul shooting that decided the
Theta Chi-Phi Kappa interfrater-
nity playoff game Thursday night.
Theta Chi came out on top, 45-50.

The winners missed but three of
16 free throws, while their vic-
tims were failing on 12 of 14.

Vukmir led the Theta Chi parade

with 13 points. His teammate,
Evans, ran second with an even
dozen. John Bendell also had a

dozen for the losing team.

The technical foul was not a
scarce commodity, as players con-
tinually sent up loud cries to the
officials, who chose disciplinary
measures.

E ps Surge

Undefeated Phi Epsilon Pi pulled
one out of the fire last Thursday as
they beat Sigma Chi, 48-41, in the
interfraternity playoffs.

The Sigs led for three quarters,
only to lose in the final minutes of
the game. , _

Sigma Chi got off to an early
lead in the first period, completely
outscoring the blue-clad Phi Ep
five. At one time, the Sigs com-’
manded a 16-5 advantage.

The Eps were able to draw even
at the half, 22-22, but their offen-
sive failed to click again in the
third quarter. The final stanza
saw the Phi Eps rack up 18 points,
with most of the scoring coming in
the final three minutes. -

Effective ball handling by the
victors in the final seconds stifled
any hope of the Sigs.

The Phi Eps high scorer, Herbie
Schults, got many of his 18 points
in the crucial fourth quarter. He
was also high scorer.

High point man for the Sigs was
Herk Duncan with 13.

Kaps Win

Accuracy at the foul line was the
margin of victory for Phi Kappa
Wednesday when
Sigma Chi, 38-33, to win the sec-
tion 2 fraternity league title. The
Phi Kaps, outscored from the field
15 to 14, converted 10 of 12 free
throws while theerratic Sigs made
just three of 17 charity tosses.

After a 6-6 first quarter tie, the
Kaps pulled away from a disorgan-

ized five and led at half-time, 19-9.

But a last half Sig rally, sparked
by Jack Devey who entered the game
despite an injured ankle, brought
the score to 30-28 with four min-
utes to play

Sigma Chi missed a chance to tie
the score when forward Bill Raunch
failed on two free throws. Kap for-
ward Tom Campbell then scored
two baskets on fast breaks to make
it 34-28, thus ending Sigma Chi’s
threat.

Masarik Gets
First Fall

John Masarik, Pitt's heavyweight,
registered his first pin in college
competition Saturday at the Stad-
ium, as the Panther wrestlers
bowed to Waynesburg, 24-7.

The fall came with only ten sec-
onds remaining in a match, which
featured two gridders as opponents.
Masarik, outweighed by some 20
pounds, pinned John DeLaurentis
with a half-Nelson and bar for
Pitt’s only victory of the afternoon.

Earlier in the meet, Pitt tallied
two points when Captain Doc Conk-
lin drew with Chuck Barneo in the
165-pound clash. Up until this
contest, the Waynesburgers, ably
coached from the stands by a large
section of rooters, had straight-
jacketed the Panthers by racking
up four decisions and a fall in
five frays.

After the Conklin-Barneo draw,
Ray Carlson, Jacket 175 pounder,
pinned Tony Razzano with a crotch
and half-Nelson. Before the fall,
Razzano, having scored two take-
downs, was awarded four points
and led Carlson, 4-1. Referee Lynn

Waite ’s Knee Brace Stars Win

By MYRON KOPELMAN

S ‘lFiCup ecomesi‘
 Nuisance to Refs

Sports Editor

The Interfraternity Cup, a large hunk of shiny metal, is making

a nuisance of itself.

Several years back, when it was originally determined that
championship fraternity teams would be accredited points toward
the acquisition of a cup, nolfody was known to have suspected

that such a prospect would prove
detrimental.

Now, intramural basketball offi-
cials are complaining tliat the cup
provides so much incentive that
players regard losing as the worst
fate which life can hold for them.

Naturally, they abuse the offi-
cials whenever the whistle goes
against them. Give us the dear
old ind_ependents, say the boys in
striped shirts.

MIKE MlLLlGAN’S football club,
you may recall’, started last year’s
season sloppily against William 81
Mary, winning by a scant 13-7
score. Len Casanova’s Santa Clara
teams were also noted for slow
starts.

The difference is that Casanova

will not start the 1950 season
against a William & Mary, but
against a traditionally strong

D uke University .

WEST VIRGINIA University has-
ketball players, according to the
student newspaper there, say their
home rooters treat visiting teams
worse than they-the Mounties-have
been treated on any court in any
corner of the land.

Of course, Morgantown fans don’t
really get into top form until Doc
Carlson’s Panthers come to pay
their respects. Henry seems to be
an irritating fellow to the fans,
probably because of such past
stunts as wearing a gas mask to
protest the officiating.

Or the time he was swept into
the vigorous spirit of the West
.Virginia cheering section --so much
‘so that he stood up and led the
cheers. The rooters were so puz-
zled they did not know whether to

   

   

   

follow him or cease.

WHETHER YOU ARE a T.-t‘orma-
tion or single wing advocate, there
is no denying that the majority of
high school players would rather
attend T schools.

It is no secret that some of the
state’s best schoolboys have deve-
loped a sudden affection for Pitt
since Casanova’s T replaced Mil-
ligan’s single wing attack. Names
are not being «mentioned yet, but
some prize catches are as good as
in the bag.

SOME FRATERNITY collars
will get hot, but those frat boys
who don’t play ball merely for pres-
tige will regard the new Bemis
Playoff System as a fair proposi-
tion.

Under the new setup, the top
fraternity team will not automatic-
ally qualify to play the top non-frat
club for the All-Campus title. In-
stead, IF’s best will battle it out
with the outstanding clubs of seven
other leagues in an elimination
tourney.

Thus, runnerup honors will not
necessarily go to a fraternity. The
Greeks will compete on even foot-
ing with all other clubs. Prestige
will be the only element lost-and
those who play their basketball
just for good clean fun won't mind
a bit.

Aids Pitt Gridders

Knee operations are a thing of
the past for Pitt gridmen since
Trainer Howard Waite invented his
knee brace. 

Only Halfback Bill Abraham has
had a knee operationat Skyscraper
U. in the last decade, and that was
because of a recurrence of an old
injury that occurred before his com-
ing here.

Waite came to Pitt in 1940 and a
year later he was using the brace
for practical purposes.

lllinois'Man

"The braces that were on the
market weren’t satisfactory,” ex-
plains the veteran trainer, “and
that’s the reason I worked on my
own.”

Howard first became interested
in his profession while a student
at the University of Illinois. He
was ﬁn-student trainer there besides
playing some football and wrestling.

‘'1 was almost an athlete,” says
the tall and husky Waite.

After graduating in 1950, Howard
was trainer and physical education
instructor at Colorado College for
five years. The next five years
were spent at the University of
Colorado where he was trainer and
swimming coach.

Already Worked for Captain

Except for an interruption of three
years by Uncle Sam-his boss was
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton un-
der the Naval V-5 program—Waite
has spent the rest of his career at
Pitt.

Howard’s knee brace is patented
and is manufactured at a factory in
Grove City, Pa.

“A good tape job is almost as
good as a brace,” he points out,
“but the continual taping may cause
the skin to get tender and become
uncomfortable. That's why a brace
is better.”

Evidence to prove that the Pan-
ther trainer’s brace is doing the

BRACE UP. ATHLETES -Train-
er Howard Waite, shown here giving
a rubdown, is the inventor of a
knee brace which has proved highly
successful in the prevention of
injuries. Waite is called upon by
high school coaches throughout the
district to administer to their ath-
letes.

twice at 43-43 and 50-49-

West Virginia’s ineptness at the
foul line proved its downfall. The
Mounties made good on only 7 of
25 attempts, missing many in the
late stages.

Tempers flared in the last min-
ute of the game, with a brawl threa-
tening to develop at one point.
Players, coaches, cops, and spec-
tators all raced onto the floor when
Jack Shockey, burly Mountie for-
ward, started swinging his el-
bows around.

Officials Puzzling

"It looked as if the referee Gallo
threw Shockey out of the game,”
said Carlson, "but yet he didn't
award us a foul shot. You just
can't figure officials out.”

Pitt actually won the game on a
technical foul called on Mark Work-
man, 6-8 Mountie center, Hromanik
netting‘ the point. Carlson, too, had
technical called on him, but the
Mounties missed their shot.

In the prelim, Pitt’s freshmen,
led by Mickey Zernich’s 21 points,
defeated the West Virginia fresh-

men, 62-52.

Bemis System Inaugurated
For All-Campus Playoffs

The true strength of the fraternity clampion will be‘put to test this
year with the inauguration of the Bemis Playoff Sy,stem.
In past years, the IF winner went directly into the final all-campus?“

game. Winners of the half dozen or
so leagues had to run a playoff
among themselves to determine who
would face the frat champ for the
bigtitle.
Old System Poor

With this type of system, the
frat team was always positive of
at least a runner-up spot in the all-
campus standings, while the inde-
pendent winners of their indivi-
dual leagues could be eliminated
in the first round. ‘

Now the intramural director has
come up with a new system. Bemis
will now consider the frat winners
as just another league winner. The
Greeks will be thrown in with the
other six leagues--four independ-
ent, one professional, and one engi-
neering --with an elimination“tour-
ney run off.

Two League Representatives

This year, too, Bemis has start-
ed another plan. That is, to have
the first two teams from each fea-

job is shown by the fact that many
colleges and professional teams are
using it. Northwestern, Indiana:
Tennessee, Los Angeles Dons, and
the Washington Redskins are just a
few. 3)’ DAVE PCLLOCK

IM BASKETBALL has set a re-
cord this season. There have been
more forfeit games this year than
any previous year, causing Leo C.
Bemis quite a headache.

gue represent that league in the
playoffs.

In Soccer

The Yankees moved into second
place in the IM soccer league by
beating Ellsworth Center, 6-O,
while the league leading Library
All Stars were turning back the
challenge of the First Presbyter-
ian Church, 7-1, on Thursday.

Bjll Durkit with four goals and
Ray Gennaro with two backed up
goalie Tom Conboy’s shutout in
the nets for the Yanks. Chick Wat-
tik was the ‘big gun for the Miners
in their victory over the FPC. He
booted home three goals.

The Presbyterians have a chance
to move back into a tie for second
place next Thursday when they
battle the Yankees at Trees Field.
Undefeated Library should have
little trouble against the winless
Center squad at Ellsworth Field.

Pitt Riflemen p
Beat Maryland

Pitt’srifle team, under the coach-
ing of Watts Shablowski returned
home victoriously this week after
defeating Maryland University in
the annual Marine match at Mary-
land.

Pitt came out in third place in
the Class B section scoring a
total of 1348 points. Shablowski an-
nounced that this is the highest
score fired by the rifle team in the
last four years.
