Contending that every Dutchman

is doing his utmost to resist the
inﬁltration of Germans and Ger-
man ideology, Dr. Alexander Lou-
don, Dutch minister to the United

States, spoke before a student :for- 0

um Thursday afternoon as the

guest of the Foreign Policy asso-
ciation. A

_ Because the Netherlands are so
level, Dr. Loudon explained, guer-
illa warfare as it is carried on in
Greece, Norway,_,and Yugoslavia, is
impossible. '

“The Dutchman’s method is to
hamper production as much as he
can,” Dr. Loudon said, but he re-
fused to reveal any of these meth-
ods on the grounds that the infor-
mation could be relayed back to
Germany. _

At the beginning of the talk,
Dr. London said he could bring no

 good news concerning" the situation '

and Friday evenings in the Foster
memorial. Tickets may be obtained
for 55 cents per person at the sales
booth in the ground floor lobby or
from members of Pitt Players.

Only one male voice will be heard
in the play, that of the “shadow”
played by Buell Whitehill, director
of the Players.

Fraternities and other groups
may purchase 10 or more tickets
at a reduced rate, according to
Ruth Greenstein, C43, director of
ticket sales.

Tait Lists Bands g
For Military Ball

MDespite existing rumors to the
contrary, Ted‘ Weems and his or-
chestra will be the featured band
at the Military Ball, March 20. The
dance is scheduled for the William
Penn hotel.

According to Ed Tait, C42, pub-
licity chairman, the ball this year
will have four orchestras instead
of the usual three. Bunny Berigan
is the second band, and Rusty Wil-
liams and his local outﬁt will also
play. The remaining band has not
yet been signed.

Since reservation tickets are no
longer available to ROTC students.
remaining tickets go on sale to the
general student body today. Tick-
ets, which are $3.50, will be sold to
the first students who apply at the
office of Lt. Donald R. Campbell,
437 Cathedral.

“The doctors have arrived too late
to do anything more than say the
patient had double pneumonia and
that the temperature is still ris-
ing.”

He described the apathetic at-
titude of Holland toward the Ger-
man war program until it was too
late. Munich woke the country up
and re-armament began, "but five
days after the invasion of the
Netherlands the government order-
ed its men to lay down their arms.

Dr. Loudon made it clear that
the Dutch government had not of-
ficially surrendered or concluded
an armistice. It had given these or-
ders to prevent further destruction
of cities unprepared to ’ defend
themselves, he said.

“The policy of the civil adminis-

‘tration of the German occupation
forces is bent," the Dutch minister
-declared, “toward the destruction
of the Dutch mentality, the Dutch
way of thinking and way of life.

Peace Plans

Students from seven district colcs _
Ieges yesterday discussed plans 1 up
for a peace conference platform

that included policing the world

lishing an international council to
control a nation’s internal as well

0 as external economic relations. ‘

Meeting on the Mount Mercy *
college campus, representatives of:
the Intercollegiate Conference on 0

Government which will take place‘

in Harrisburg, March 26 to 29, dis- D A

cussed such various points as:

Establishment of a world court; 0
free trade between all nations; do-j f
struction of all land fortiﬁcations; ,
reducing armies to 100,000 men; is 0
abolition of reserve armies and .3
military training; and conducting -

war guilt trials.

The 65 students, from P*itt,kPGW. 
Seton 7
Hill, St. Vincent, and Californisfa

Duquesne, Mount Mercy.

State teachers’ college, however,
disagreed on the speciﬁc ways in

which these points should be car-

ried out.

While the University committee D‘

on economic relations headed by
VAlbert Mavrinac, C44, advocated
the establishment of regional coun-

cils to rule on economic‘ problems-
between nations, and also .prob-.

lems on labor, production, con-
sumption, and proﬁts, other dele-F

‘gations wanted difficulties arbi-

trated by the individual nations.

Political‘ relations after the War”_
would be divided into regional org

state federations which would be
a part of a world plan, -and a world
court would be conducted to settle

disputes between nations. But the

would" be the policing of the world

can  the ﬁrst non-graduate coach
on the Panther staff since 1929. In
explaining his choice for the va-
cancy on his staff, ‘Coach Bowser
stated: .“He’s the best man for the
job.” From the record he made as
at player and coach we are inclined
to "agree on the selection of Eva-
shevski.

Evashevski declared that be
thought‘ there were '_ no primary
differences in the styles of play

'used.in the Big Ten and in the
East. He stated: “They all play to
win.” However, he did say that the
spinner play is used much more in

' » the East than in the Mid-West.

Tom Harmon, his famous team-
mate at Michigan, is the best col-
lege player he has ever seen, while
George Franck of Minnesota and
Francis Reagen of Penn are best
collegians he played against.

Only: 22. years old, the new Pan-

and is the father of a baby boy. He
was a success at,Michigan as a

success story nloving here at Pitt,

With the doivntown papers’ her-
alding the coming of spring now
that thebig league-ball clubs are
in training, spring football prac-
tice, Pitt’s own herald of the ar-
rivalsof warmer weather, gets un-
derway next Monday. Actually
practice has already begun, but it
is of the indoor variety, consisting

of skull drills twice a week.

This year's Panther gridiron

squad will no doubt be,one of‘ the
smallest to,ever“r'eport at the Sta-
dium. The war has already cut
into the team and it is not unlike-
ly that before the fall drills begin
many more potential football stars
will be in the armed services.
' Providing the weather is right,
spring practice will run for ﬁve-
weeks, but if the s ‘\v stays on,

necessary. The drills will start
daily at 5:00 o’clock. Coach Charlie
Bowser explained that the late
starting time is because of labora-
tory classes that numerous players

To Appear Wednesday  

2 Defense stamp posters will ap-
pear on campus Wednesday for the
fﬁrst "time since the inauguration

. Whether the posters will be dis-

S .played continuously during the

drive, or just used on Wednesdays
is undecided.

Although the committee has been
“more than pleased” with the ris-
ing volume of sales each Wednes-
day. chairman Herbert Gall, M43,
still believes that the student body
is not solidly behind the drive. At
at committee meeting last Friday,
suggestions were made to increase
sales.

Adopted as “most plausible”
was the proposal that 100 addi-
tional salesmen be recruited, each
one required to sell at least 10
stamps. A total of 1,000 stamps
would be sold in addition to those
sold by the regular committee and

  War To Ruin Individualism

3: MICHAEL LAZAROFF
Individualism, from proﬁt-seele
ing corporation heads to the aver-
age housewife, is being rapidly de-
stroyed by the war effort and it
will be extinct in the post-war re-
construction period. a

Dr. Marion K. McKay, profes-
sor of economics, predicted today
that the government control of in-
dustry prompted by the war would
continue into the post-war recon-
struction period and the tradition-
al American doctrine of “freedom
of enterprise will be limited" by
the scrutiny of government agen-

cies extended into the industrial

ﬁeld.

“Rugged individualism that has
persisted to our day will be hedged
in by federal regulations and will
surely become a thing of the past,”
Dr. McKay said.

“Regulation of industry will
mean control of proﬁts,” he ex-
plained, “either by more extensive
proﬁt-sharing developments or by
increased taxation. The present
high and steadily increasing level
of taxation will to a great degree
be retained after the war.”

'Wartime rationing and the reg-

ime. Debates Scheduled

Members of t‘he.Men’s debating
association will participate in three
debates today and tomorrow, be-
ginning one of the busiest “argu-
ing" weeks of the year, according

instructor.

C43; Harold Gondelman, C43, and

ulation of consumption will de-

velop household budgeting habits S

which will no doubt lead to the
“restriction of individual freedom”

as well as big business, Dr. McKay '

declared. “The American people,
long noted for their extravagance,
will become more conscious of the
need for economic planning and
conservation during peace as well
as in war,” he went on.

Continuation of government reg-
ulation following the war does not
mean that there will be a sharp
turnover from the peace-time eco-
nomic systems of the past, nor the
introduction of radically new de-
velopments. Rather the “post-war
adjustments will be made within
the capitalistic system.”

Dr. McKay anticipates more
favorable trade relations between
the United States and other no.-

tions. “After the war, the United _

States will be in a strategic posi-
tion to develop world trade."
He believes that the United
States should and very likely will
enter into a program of economic
planning for the whole world as
well as a domestic one. Satisfactory
trade relations between the nations
