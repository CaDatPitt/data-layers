Tim Cummings was minutes away from
requesting $13,590 in allocations for the
men’s club volleyball team when the Stu-
dent Government Board announced its
plan to decrease the amountlof money
given to student clubs and organizations.
“I was at the Board meeting when they
read the statement about how they essen-
tially do not have any money left,” Cum-
mings, the team’s president, said. “I knew
at that point I had basically no chance of
getting anywhere near that number.”
The Board approved $6,270 — less
than half of the amount of Cummings’
request —— at its public meeting Feb. 11.
“I think the outcome of that decision
was greatly affected by the timing, but who
could blame [the Board]?” Cummings said.
“It’s better that they decided to tighten
the ﬁnances up now before,it’s too late.”
' The Board starts out each year with
almost $930,000 from the Student Activi-
ties Fund, which undergraduate, full-time
and non-College of General Studies stu-
dents contribute to in annual $160 student
activities fees — $80 paid each semester.

The Pitt men’s basketball team held Florida
State without a made ﬁeld goal for the ﬁnal
two minutes of Sunday’s game after Okaro
White beat the shot clock from beyond the
arc to give the Seminoles a six—point lead
with 2:20 to play.

I As it was, Florida State didn’t need an-
other ﬁeld goal because the Seminoles scored
13 points from the free-throw line in the ﬁnal

against Pitt, spoiling Senior Day for Lamar
Patterson and Talib Zanna and extending
the Panthers’ losing streak to a season-high
three games.

“The free throws in the second half, I
think that weighed on us,” head coachjamie
Dixon. said.v“When you keep missing, and
they’re knocking down free throws, they
beat us at the free-throw line.” I

Florida State (16-11, 7-8 ACC) ﬁnished
27—of—31 from the charity stripe for an ex-
cellent 87.1 percent clip while the Panthers
(20—7, 8-6 ACC) shot a measly 64.3 percent,
making just 18-of—28 attempts.

“They only missed four free throws. We _
missed 10,” guard Cameron Wright said. ’ ‘F

Linen palaces: Sororities build blanket forts for charity

Raechelle Landers
Staff Writer

One might have mistaken the Belleﬁeld
Hall gym for a massive slumber party
Saturday afternoon, as sorority members
rushed to build blanket forts for philan-
thropy. ‘

Sigma Chi hosted its fourth annual
Wrap Up America event for charity Sat-
urday at noon in the Belleﬁeld Hall gym.
About 400 sorority sisters competed to
build blanket forts after having about a
month before the event to obtain the most
blanket donations. In addition to Sigma
Chi, eleven other Pitt sororities partici-
pated in the event.

The forts were constructed along the
walls of the gym. Two were connected to
the basketball hoops, giving them extra
height and support. The forts were closer

in resemblance to houses and featured
a plethora of colors and designs. A few
of the brothers from Sigma Chi coached
each sorority. '

Participants constructed the forts us-
ing cardboard boxes, PVC pipes and duct
tape in addition to the blankets. Eight forts
varying in height from 7 to 15 feet outlined
the small gym. To earn extra originality
points, some sororities used white Christ-
mas lights. One sorority used only animal
print blankets for their fort in the corner
of the gym.

As the judges examined the forts, each
sorority received 30 seconds to introduce
its forts. Before the judges reached it, part
of Chi Omega’s fort collapsed. The sorority
sisters hurried to straighten out the ﬂat-
tened section before the judges reached
them. ..

Beta Phi Alpha, the overall winner of

the event, was awarded an engraved trophy

because it donated more blankets than any .

other sorority with 693.

Sigma Sigma Sigma won the category
for best structure with its fort. Delta Zeta
won the category for most appeal, and
Gamma Sigma Sigma won for originality.

The sororities were judged by Michael '
‘Seiler, alumnus and past president of the '

fraternity; John Dougherty, alumnus and
past vice president; Chris Clemson, phi-
lanthropy chair of Sigma Chi; and Trevor
Joelson, president of Wrap'Up America,
the national charity "organization respon-
sible for organizing the event. The judges
selected winners based on the number of

blanketsth_ey donated, how many mem-. .

bers attended the event and fort quality.
Fort quality was based on appeal, structure
and originality.

Ben Gentile, a junior ﬁnance major- and

. ' r
member of Sigma Chi, helped organize
the event. He said they would donate the
blankets to the Salvation Army.

“It’s an opportunity on a Saturday to
get 400 people together to have a lot of

fun and work toward a good cause,” Gen— '
A tile said, adding that his favorite part was
beating their goal of 3,000 blankets.

With a total of 3,300 blankets, Pitt’s
Wrap Up America not only broke last year’s

_ record of 2,400 blankets, but also donated
‘ more blankets to the SalvationArmy than

other participating schools, Clemson said.

Other schools that held ‘the event
through Wrap Up America include the Uni-
versities of Louisville, Kentucky, Michigan,

"Minnesota, Dayton and Toledo.

The current and previous Board allo-
cated $912,468.45 so far this ﬁscal year
— which runs fromjuly 2013 tojune 30,
2014 — to student groups with the help
of the Allocations Committee.

The Board has about $100,000, which
includes overhead from last ﬁscal year,
left to allocate to student organizations
for the rest of this ﬁscal year.

The previous Board allocated in bud-
gets and supplemental requests a total
of $811,971.22 this ﬁscal year, which is
more than two-thirds of the total funds
both the previous Board and the current
Board received to allocate for an entire
ﬁscal year.

the money that we have.”

Harun announced the funding ap-
proach at the public meeting Feb. 11, and
Board President Mike Nites said students

should know the ﬁnancial issue facing.

the Board.

“We felt that it was important to be
transparent with how much money we
have left because we are going to be strict-
er with allocations,” Nites said.

Kenyon Bonner, director of Student
Life, saidlthe Student Activities Fundac—
cumulated fees from 17,256 full—time un-
dergraduate students and 1,173 part-time
undergraduate students, which totals
$2,817,264 collected for the Fund this
ﬁscal year.

This ﬁscal year, Student Affairs dis-
tributed 45 percent of the fund to for-
mula groups -~ the Pitt Program Coun-
cil, WPTS Radio, Panther Prints and Pitt

Serves —' and 22 percent of the fund went

to operating expenses of organizations
within Student Life that support student
groups, such as the Student Organiza-
tion Resource Center, Student Life staff
salaries and student employee salaries.

Formula groups are student organizations
that receive a predetermined portion of
funding each year. ’

The Student Government Board re-
ceived about 33 percent of the fund, or

about $929,697.12, to allocate toward»

student resources andoperations, staff
and student employees.

The Board and the Allocations Com-
mittee are responsible for distributing
that total to student groups.

“Student Affairs has ultimate respon-

' sibility over the funds from the activity

fee, however, the University believes in
the concept of allowing SGB to manage
a percentage of the activity fee,” Bon-
ner said.

Harun said the amount of allocations
requests could also be affected by the
increasing number of student groups. ‘

According to Nites, the number of reg-
istered clubs. and organizations is nearing
400, while the Student Activities Fee that
students pay each year has not increased

February 24, 2014 I The Pitt News I \/wvx/v.pitthevvs.c0rh

since 2006.

Nites said that when he was a Board
member in 2012, the number of student
groups was only about 300 and that the
increase of student groups might be caus-
ing an increase in allocations requests.

“It seems like we’re getting more
and more requests, especially from club
sports,” N ites said.

Nites said that he does not think an
increase of the Student Activities Fee is
necessary in the immediate future.

“Before considering raising the Stu-
dent Activities Fee, SGB will make every
effort to propose a long—term and sustain-
able solution given the current amount of
annual funds,” Nites said.

Bonner said he believes the increase
in allocations might result from the in—
creased awareness among student groups
about the availability of allocations.

“Recently organizations have become
more involved in the allocations process
in large part because the Student Gov-
ernment Board has done a better job
in the past three or four years of raising
awareness about the Student Activities
Fund and how to request from the fund,”

Bonner said.

Bonner said that if the Board thinks
the Student Activities Fee should be
raised, Student Affairs will consider the
notion. °

‘_‘Now after eight years since the last
increase, it’s a good opportunity to start
talking about whether a fee increase is
necessary,” Bonner said. “If the Board
thinks the fee should be increased and

the students support an increase, then we

can take the notion into consideration,
but the notion must originate from the
Board and the student body.”

Harun said one of the reasons there
has been an increase in allocations dis-
tributed this year is because of “liberal
decision making in regard to allocations
requests and the interpretation ofal1oc‘a-
tions policies by the previous SGB.”

N ites said the previous SGB had allo-
cated high sums of money to individual
student groups, especially among club
sports.

“I think it was an overall mentality
where we weren’t really asking ourselves
‘What do studentorganizations need to
exist?’ Instead, we were asking ourselves

Learning to Wyoming Field Studies in Ecology
and Paleontology
Four credits :2 June 23 to July 26, 2014

A team of faculty from geology, ecology, and anthropology will deliver
a unique hands-on course experience by integrating content and field
methods instruction on the Allen L. Cook Spring Creek Preserve in
Wyoming. We will explore prairie basins and the ecosystems leading
up to the snowfields of the Medicine Bow Mountains; study mammals,
birds, insects, and stream ecosystems using binoculars, live trapping,
and remote cameras; excavate dinosaurs and Native American
hearths; reconstruct ancient environments revealed by rock outcrops
and their fossils; discuss water rights, cattle grazing, and economic
A development; and experience a spectacular array of natural wonders on -
camping trips into other areas of Wyoming. insights gleaned from the
course will form a foundation for students from any major to recognize
and understand the local and regional impacts of human activities
on the planets values, no matter where life’s journey takes them.

‘What do they want?’ and giving them
everything they asked for,” N ites said.

Nites noted one instance in particular
where he believes too much money was
allocated to individual student organi-
zations.

Last October, after previously reject-
ing the request, the last Board allocated
$26,770.10 to the Pitt Sailing Club for the
purchase of six used sailboats.

“That was a lot of money for one stu-
dent group,” Nites said.

Harun said the committee and the
Board will be more frugal in the amount
of money allocated in the future.

“Our current SGB cannot continue to
fund at this level and rate,” Harun said.

Alex Majchrzak, the previous Alloca-
tions Committee chair, said he supports

the current Board’s decision to publicly

announce its ﬁnancial situation.
Majchrzak said he feels sympathetic
for the current Board because it must
now restrict funding to make up for the
amount of money the previous Board al-

“The Allocations Committee last year
attempted to control funding levels, but
was unsuccessful largely as a result of
frequent overturning of the Allocation
Committee’s decisions by the board,”
Majchrzak said.

Gordon Louderback, the previous
Student Government Board president,
declined to comment on the spending
practices of the 2012-2013 Board-

“If you’re looking for my opinion, I no
longer think it’s relevant, and I’d prefer
to not interfere with what SGB does since
I have left,” Louderback said. ’

Nites said he and Harun will approach
student organizations that already receive

large sums of money from the Student =

Activities Fund, such as Student Affairs
Affiliated Groups and formula groups,
to ask that any leftover funds be given
back to SGB in order to be reallocated to
other groups.

‘ But Harun said that they “aren’t going
to force anyone to do anything they don’t
want to,” and Nites agreed. h

“We’re not telling the groups that they
have to give the money back to us,” Nites
said. “We’re just seeing if they are willing
to give some back.” M g

Nites also said any leftover money
from student groups at the end of this
ﬁscal year will be absorbed back into the
Student Activities Fund for the next ﬁs-
calyear. I

“If groups are not" going to use that

money, there, is no reason to tie itfup for
.several months,” Nites said.,- ‘ I
A Nites said that he and the rest of _the '

Board are currently brainstorming-solu-.
-tions that would help the Board to “better *

prioritize current spending.” He plans to
meet weekly with Gina Scozzaro, busi-

~ ness manager at the Student Organization

Resource Center, to check on the official
amount left in the allocations fund until

. the end of this ﬁscal year.

Nites also said he plans to meet with
Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey to go over the current distri-
bution of the money, collected, through
the Student Activities. Fee to determine
whether changes would better accom-
modate students.

“We would examine how much money
formula groups are getting, how much

money they’re using, what they’re using ‘

it on and see if it’s time to make to change
some of those percentages,” Nites said.

PALLIGRAPH  

Rapid bus transit system would detract from more critical

Rohith Palli
Columnist

Mayor Bill Peduto and County

' Executive Rich Fitzgerald want
‘to create a bus rapid transit

system between Oakland and
Downtown. This would be a
definite improvement for stu-
dents looking to go ice skating
or to a theater downtown, but
the investment might not be
worth it for the city as a whole.

Allegheny County and the
city of Pittsburgh need a com-
prehensive plan to improve
transit. That means planning
to improve service for Port Au-
thority bus and T riders as well
as drivers, bikers and pedes-
trians. Focus on the Oakland-
Downtown bus rapid transit
systemis premature and might
detract from a focus on devel-

oping a comprehensive way to
improve transportation.

It’s not that bus rapid transit
is in and of itself a bad idea —
in fact, it is an excellent way to
improve bus service. Though
implemented differently in
each city, bus rapid transit has
already benefited Pittsburgh
bus riders greatly by bypass-
ing traffic and reducing travel
times on the busways. Addition-
ally, smart off—bus payment sys-
tems and dedicated bus lanes
—— like those used in Cleveland’s
Healthline — could improve
service to any bus corridor by
making buses faster and more
reliable.

Furthermore, permanent
lane conversions and station
construction generally spur
economic innovation. Accord-
ing to Forbes Magazine, every

QPINIQNS

dollar spent building Cleve-
land’s Healthline has gener-
ated $114 in economic devel-

opment. This type of return on

investment is certainly worth
pursuing.

Making bus rapid transit
work requires careful plan-
ning and coordination as part
of a citywide conversation in
improving transit. Adding a
bus rapid transit system from
Downtown to Oakland could
make the trip much faster — an
estimated nineto 19 minute sav-
ings according to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette —- but it would do
little to alleviate difficulty for
commuters attempting to get
to work without being paired
with other improvements, such
as restoration of some services
that have been cut in the past
few years and a system to allow

riders to track buses through-
out the system.

In fact, a system such as the
one under discussion could
signiﬁcantly aggravate prob-
lems for drivers in Oakland.

The current plan would con-
vert either one lane of Forbes

Avenue or another lane of Fifth
Avenue into a bus lane. These
streets are already busy and
experience traffic congestion
throughout the day. Decreasing

the number of lanes will have a

negative impact on the ability
to drive through Oakland. For
this reason, a project that aims
to improve transit through this
corridor might in fact make it
more difficult for drivers.

. For example, if all buses in a
bus rapid transit corridor from
Oakland to Downtown termi-
nated in those neighborhoods,

 

 

transit issues

riders wanting to travel further
would have to transfer. For
these passengers, total travel
times could" increase. Just as
importantly, fewer riders will
want to take a system that re-
quires a transfer. On the other
hand, if the 61 and 71 bus lines
are allowed to continue into the
bus rapid transit system, they
will introducevariability in ar-
rival times and counteract the
added reliability of bus rapid
transit.

Engineers must work out all
of these details. Unfortunately,
debate and ﬁscal planning are
coming forward for the pro-
posed bus rapid transit system
without a full study of how to
build it and what impact it will
have. We will be in a much bet-

ter position to understand how this sys-
tem works in a year or two after initial
engineering studies —- already budgeted
— are completed. a

In the end, it’ might be the case that
other bus corridors require more atten-
tion than the Oakland-Downtown cor-

ridor. Though the journey from Oakland '
to Downtown can be time-consuming:

February 24, 2014 | The Pitt News I vvvvvv.pittnev\_/seem

because of road traffic, it’s a fairly
simple process otherwise. Other areas,
especially those that have experienced
service cuts, are more in need of trans-
portation.

Here, since the bus rapid transit sys— _

tern is unlikely to be the optimal way to

improve transport_at_i.o_n inthe city,_we:.
ggiee a dilemma between"transportation

‘development for the purpose of provid-.
ing necessary service and tra_nspo-rta-

tion development for the purpose of.

economic -development. This is much

more than‘ a simple policy decision. It
is a priorities judgment that must be
made with care.

If federalfunding isn’t at high enough
levels, bus rapid transit between Oak-
land and Downtown might not be a good

investment, even with some funding. ‘

If the state government also helps out,
bus rapid transit could,be a good in-
vestment for the city. If little outside

funding materializes, however, $200

million seems too steep a‘ price to pay
for this small part of the overall travel

transit map. On the other hand, if that
investment spurs billions of dollars in
economic development, maybe the bus
rapid transit system will pay off.
Ultimately, Pittsburgh and Peduto
need to be_careful in spending scarce
transit money. The goal shouldn’t be

to invest in a popular program, but to ,
spend money where it can serve the‘
‘needs of the citizens, whetherfor basic

transportation improvements or eco-
nomicdevelopment. I l

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Patterson, Panthers come
upshort on Senior Night

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Lamar Patterson wasn’t ready to walk
off the court yet. In his eyes, the cel-
ebration of Senior Night on Sunday
wasn’t finished. b

After making just 3—of—16 shots
through(37 minutes, Patterson was
catching fire while the time and oppor-
tunities for a comeback against Florida
State were dwindling.

Patterson, playing in the penultimate
contest of his career at the Petersen
Events Center, scored Pitt’s ﬁnal 16
points in three minutes‘. He finished

’ with 22, but his last hurrah fell short.

The redshirt senior fouled out in a
one-possession game with time still on
the clock — the only way the Seminoles
were going to stop his momentum and
hang on for a.71-66 win.

“I’m not really sure you couldhold a
guy like that down,” Florida State coach
Leonard Hamilton said, shaking his
head as he replayed some of Patterson’s
ﬁnal shots. “You saw him at the end of
the game, we doing everything we could
to try and stop him, and he_was knock-
ing down threes from the parking lot.”

It took awhile for the shots to fall
for Patterson and fellow redshirt senior
Talib Zanna, who, as a 6-foot-9'center,
was busy trying to work in the paint
against a pair of7—footers. He shotjust
one ﬁeld goal in the ﬁrst and three in
the second.

But if there was one thing the un-
dersized Panther could pull off against
Boris Bojanovsky (7—foot—3, 240 pounds)
and Michael Ojo (7-foot—1, 290 pounds),
it was corralling missed shots. And the

“You put that together, we win the ball
game.”

Pitt held the advantage at the free-throw
line throughout the ﬁrst half and into the
second through an aggressive approach by
the Panthers, according to Florida State
head coach Leonard Hamilton. Because of
their aggression in getting to the basket, the
Panthers had shot 15 more free throws than
the Seminoles at one point in the second half.

“We couldn’t get out of the way, and there
was contact. They were forcing the contact,
and they got to the foul line,” Hamilton said.
“They were very smart in their approach at
that particular time.”

Hamilton then guided his team’s focus to
the free-throw line, emulating the strategy
employed by Dixon up to that point. There,
the Seminoles took control of the game.

“We called a timeout, we became a little

more aggressive, so we got to the foul line in
a similar fashion,” Hamilton said. “Fortunate
enough for us, we knocked those down.”

Missing 10 free throws to the Seminoles’
four reﬂects on what Wright believes ac-
counts for Pitt’s current three-game skid.

“I personally feel like we beat ourselves,
the last three games,” Wright said. f‘It’s a
battle with ourselves. The game is more
mental than it is physical.”

With the Panthers seemingly losing that
battle the past three outings, the side effects
have manifested primarily in the team’s of-
fensive characteristics, according to its head
coach. For one, Dixon believesimpatience is
the biggest enemy to Pitt’s offensive success.

“Shooting bad shots, just not moving
the ball like we’re known for and what we
have done,” Dixon said. “You can lose it for
periods of time, but I think we’ve lost it for
a stretch here.”

The Panthers shot just 37 percent from

WEEKEND RECAP

February 24, 2014 I The Pitt News I vwvvx/.pittnevvs.com

Wrestling team clinches ACC Championship in Weekend action

Jeremy Tepper
Staﬂ Wrz‘ter

A weekend ﬁlled with action was high-
lighted by Pitt’s wrestling team claiming an
outright conferenc‘e championship while

the baseball and softball teams each picked '

up a pair of wins in the South.

Wrestling

The No. 10 Panthers took advantage
of their opportunity to clinch the ACC
championship, besting North Carolina
22-12. Pitt ﬁnished undefeated in confer-
ence matches, going 6-0 and upping its
record to 13-3. _

Senior heavyweight P._I. Tasser capped
off the meet with a 8-1 win over Bob Coe
to bring the ﬁnal score to 22-12.

Baseball

The Panthers repeated the pattern of
success from their ﬁrst weekend of action
by winning their ﬁrst two games, but drop-
ping the ﬁnal game of the weekend at the
USC-Upstate Tournament in Myrtle Beach,
S.C. _An offensive outburst led Pitt (4-2) to
a 15-7 victory against Butler on Friday.

PATTERSON

Panthers gave themselves plenty of op-
portunities.

Zanna grabbed 14 rebounds — in-
cluding five offensively —— as the Pan-
thers shot just 20-of-54 from the ﬁeld.
He scored only seven points.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon thought
the team’s issues were patience and shot
selection, but credited the Seminoles
for using their size to disrupt the of-
fense.

“You get 14 offensive rebounds, and
you only get nine second-chance points,
that doesn’t add up,” he said. “[The big
men] changed some shots, they had ﬁve
blocks to our three.”

So the Panthers kept ﬁring —- and
usually missing — from afar.

Like when they had the ball with
three minutes to play, the shot clock
slipping to zero and trailing, 55-50.
Patterson had no choice but to hoist a
challenged 3—pointer.

Panherswent -O In Irrst yea as ACC members. obby Mizi |Visua| Editor

Florida State guard Aaron Thomas
was right behind Patterson, though,
and recorded an easy block. The ball
went right back to Patterson with a sec-
ond left, and he was forced to heave a
prayer ofa shot. Redshirtjunior Cam-
eron Wright snagged the rebound and
fed to Patterson, who cut his way to the
basket for a twisting layup.

“I did think that at least we made him
work for his shots  our goal was to try
to at least make him work a little harder
to get good looks,” Hamilton said.

It didn’t seem like much at the time,
but more like a continuation of his pe-
destrian evening. In one possession that
was elongated by the offensive rebound,
Patterson managed to make one shot
on three tries. And by the end of it, Pitt
was still behind. ‘

But that seemingly innocent layup
sparked a fire inside Patterson, leading
him to sink two free throws. And then
a 3-pointer from the right corner that
cut the deficit to 60-57, despite a hand
in his face.

Even though Patterson was going off

from deep, the Seminoles kept a safe
distance from the Panthers by hitting
free throws that pushed their lead to
two or three possessions. The trend
continued:’Patterson hits a 3—pointer,
then Florida State sinks a foul shot or
two.

After Patterson’s final 3-pointer,
which brought“the score to 69-66
with five seconds to play, Florida State
quickly inbounded the ball to a free Ian
Miller. Patterson hadrno choice but to
foul, his ﬁfth and disqualifying ‘viola-
tion. - _

But he kept walking to the other end
of the court to the free-throw line, wait-
ing for Miller’s shots. An official ap-

’ proached Patterson, who was bent over

with his hands on his knees, and held
up five fingers. The referee brought
him the bad news and patted him on
hisback three times. Maybe to hurry
him off the court, maybe to show subtle
appreciation for the effort.

Either way, Patterson had no choice
but leave with a chance to complete
the comeback and said walking away

“I was very pleased to see 21 hits on
the board,” head coach Joe Jordano said.
“We did avery nice job at the plate against
a quality starter in Eric Stout. Butler can
swing the bats as well, and they are also
very good against the fastball. After a
shaky start, we settled in and’ did a solid
job the rest of the way.”
, Against USC-Upstate the next day, it
was the pitching that led the way, as Rhys
Aldenhoven picked up the win after allow-

‘ ing just two earned runs in six innings of

work. Hobie Harris earned his ﬁrst save
of the season by closing the door on a _5-3
Pitt win- V _

The Panthers weren’t as fortunate Sun-
day in a 9-2 loss to the Fordham Rams.
Pitt allowed six unearned runs in the loss
because of a lackluster defensive play.

Softball

. In Boca Raton, Fla., for the weekend,
Pitt won two games and dropped two oth-
ers.

The Panthers split their matches Fri-

Weekend D 9

was tough.

“I didn’t think it was over until
the horn sounded,” he said. “We just
gotta get it done during the game.”

day, defeating Kent State 1-0, but fell to
Michigan 9-0. Junior pitcher Savannah
King led Pitt against Kent State, tossing
her ﬁrst shutout of the season.

On Saturday, Pitt defeated Penn State
3-1. The Panthers recorded nine hits, with
Freshman Kaitlin Manuel and junior Carly
Thea each contributing three hits.

Kent State then avenged its loss Friday
with a 6-1 victory against the Panthers.

Tennis

In their ﬁrst taste of ACC play, the
Panthers (3-2, 0-2 ACC) dropped a pair
of matches on the road at Virginia Tech
and Wake Forest for their ﬁrst losses of the
season. The Hokies claimed a dominant
6-1 victory Saturday, while the Demon
Deacons earned a 4-3 decision Sunday.

Pitt picked up its lone point in Blacks-
burg, Va., when junior Amanda Wickman
defeated Raluca Mita, 6-3, 2-6 and 6-4
in No. 5 singles. Head coach Alex Santos
attributed part of the loss to the team’s
slow start.

“In doubles we didn’t start with the
best energy,” said Santos. “We got down
early on two courts and although we fought
back, it ended up being too little, too late,
and ultimately the slow start cost us the
doubles point.” I

The doubles point again went against
Pitt’s favor Sunday, as the Panthers split six
singles points with the Demon Deacons.
But Wake Forest took two of three matches
in doubles play to earn the match-deciding
point.

“Today we were as good as Wake Forest

in singles, but when you lose the doubles

point, you have to be better than the other
team to be successful,” Santos said. “We
played the most important points in cer-
tain spots of our lineup extremely well,
but we weren’t consistent enough across
the board.”

Women’s swimming and diving

Despite settinggseven school records,
Pitt was unable to make much headway in
ACC competition, ﬁnishing eighth in a ﬁeld
of 12. Head"=coach Chuck Knoles, though,
was proud of his team’s improvement.

“Any time you walk into a conference as
powerful as the ACC and are picked tenth
when coming into one of the strongest
conferences  move. up two spots from V
that, it really shows the work ethic and
tenacity of the ladies,” Knoles said.

Gymnastics

For the fourth competition in a row, the
Panthers ﬁnished in second‘ place, scoring
195.050 against North Carolina State. The
score was Pitt’s highest mark of the season,

Pitt staged a strong comeback by end-
ing the night with 48.950 team score on
the ﬂoor, but the Wolfpack ended up with
a 195.450 overall. Head coach Debbie
Yohman appreciated her team’s comeback
despite the loss.

“What a nice comeback,” Yohman said.
“Unfortunately, we aren’t perfect yet. We
still have to work harder, and that is some-
thing to work hard on. We had our season
high on three events, so this was a good
effort for us.

Women’s basketball

Sunday in Syracuse, N.Y., the Panthers
were blown out by 31 points, 67-36, as
they shot just 20.4 percent from the ﬁeld.
Ashlee Anderson led Pitt (11-17, 3-11 ACC)
with 11 points and six rebounds. I

the ﬁeld on 20—of-54 shooting Sunday, and
even those numbers were inﬂated by four
later 3-pointers from Patterson, who shot
4-of-17 from the ﬁeld in the 38 minutes be-
fore his late scoring binge.

Next to impatience, Dixon also refer-
enced “poor possessions” negatively impact-
ing the Panthers throughout games.

“We need to play through missed shots,
Dixon said. “I think we’re letting a missed

shot effect us two plays later.” .

Sunday’s loss is the ﬁrst for the Panthers
on a Senior Day since losing to Seton Hall
in 2006 and moves Pitt to 8-4 on such oc-
casions at the Petersen Events Center. More
importantly, Pitt’s loss moves the team lower
in the league standings — now into atie with
Clemson forﬁfth place — and just 1.5-games
above the ninth-place Seminoles.

“That’s not what I expected based on
our practices this week,” Dixon said. “I was
excited about how we worked and how we
played, but we didn’t play like we practiced.
This obviously is the result.” I
