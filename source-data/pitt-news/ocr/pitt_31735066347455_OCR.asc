Blast Inquest Raises Doubt

, BY MREA CSORBA

Gas was cited as the most likely
cause of the recent Langley Hall
explosion in testimony at a
coroner’s inquest convened to
examine the matter yesterday,
although someinvolved in the blast
investigation still expressed
doubts.

At the hearing, which is expected
to conclude today, Director of the
Utility Survey Commission, Noel
Hoglund, testiﬁed that air combus-
tibility tests taken the night of the
tragedy register low combustibility

' levels near the explosion site. High
combustibility levels would have
indicated the presence of gas at the
site.

“We got a ﬁve to 50 percent
combustibility reading along the
outer’\?‘;\ wall of." Langley Hall
auditorium which collapsed during
the explosion,” Hoglund said.
‘-‘The reading taken in the basement
of Langley Hall was absolutely free
of any combustibility.”

‘Hoglund said although testing

done arounda leaking gas mainon
Tennyson Avenuenear the adjoin-
ing building, Crawford Hall,
yielded evidence of 90 percent
presence of gas, combustibility
levels decreased nearer the explo-
sion site.

Assuming the cause of the blast ’

was gas, Hoglund said, the Langley
area should have reeked with gas
and the basement wall of the
destroyed hall would not have been
found free of combustibility.

“It could have been due to
methane from some gas pit or it is
"possible it was natural gas from a
leak,” said Sussman, chairman of
the Life Science Department and
head of a university committee
formed to examine the explosion.

Another witness, Capt. Norman
Sanner of the Pittsburgh Fire
Department agreed the gas could

 it just because they had drunk too much?. Some .
 _' students reported strange aberrations in the structure

have been methane or natural, but
he also said he hasn’t ruled out
propane.

In support of Hoglund’s testi-
mony, tests done by William
McElligott, plumbing supervisor at
Pitt, revealed only two small leaks
in the one-inch gas line which
supplied the two auditorium rooms.

This narrow gas
underneath the dividing walls of the
lecture rooms. These separated
into half-inch lines and ran down the
slope of the room to supply small
outlets in the lecturn tables at the
base of the auditoriums.

These lines were,— McElligott
said, the only gas lines running
beneath to supply the lecture
rooms. 9

‘ ‘No one can pinpoint the cause of
the blast to be gas and not
chemicals. ’ ’

Sanner, said in a private interview
after testifying he found chemicals
in the electron microscope (EM)
suite that were not acknowledged

line ran’

on the official University chemical
listing.

Sanner: revealed he found seven
cylinders of propane gas and three
containers of heavy Shell oil while
investigating the blast. These, he
said, were no longer there when he
checked the demolished labs again.

“Workmen were collecting scat-
tered parts of the EM machines, so

the chemicals may have been
removed with them, but those
chemicaks were not recorded on the
University’s ofﬁcial list,” Sanner
said. ‘ v
Because of rescue operations,
Sanner said, he could not test for
gas the day of the explosion. The
following evening, Friday, he found
no evidence of gas around the site.
Sanner also disagreedwith the
general. consensus that the explo-
sion originated in the crawl space by
the EM room. » Instead, Sanner
located the blast in the adjoining
room, the EM prep lab. At theend

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Housing rates for Pitt resident
students will be increased due to
higher costs of utilities and labor,
according to a Housing and Food
Services statement released Wed-
nesday.

Meal plan costs will also be
increased approximately 2 percent
per term, two thirds of which is for
increased labor costs.

The average room increase of 3.3
percent raises the rate of a single
room to $550 per term, double and
suite accommodations to $495.00,
triple occupancy to $345.00-—an
overall increase, of $15.00.
Forty-three percent of the increase
is attributed to labor costs and 33
percent to utility costs.

"A full 19-meal plan will be
increased $10 per term to $330, 14
meals will increase $7.00 to

CAS Reviews AC Today

BY SHARON FLAKE

The Alternative Curriculum Pro-
gram (AC), a special one year
program for‘ freshmen, will face
ﬁnal review today by members of
the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Council. 2

AC was established in 1973 to
increase the number of learning
possibilities available to freshmen,
according to CAS Dean Robert
Marshall. Marshall said the

program was developed at a time
when students wanted to play a
more active role in their education.

AC, which has been in effect for

four years, will be ' given the
go-ahead or face termination after
the council vote today. According to
one member of the Council,
prospects look good that AC will be
continued, although there are some
proposals for change.

Verbal testimony from faculty
and students involved with AC were
presented along with a 72-page
brief to the CAS Council at the end
of January. 2

According to the report, “the
central goal of the program has
always been to provide students
with resources and supportive
organization which would help them

  
     

   

   
  

   a

locate their own educational goals,
direction and motivation and, to
design the rest of their education
more intelligently and thought-
fully.”

Since its inception, enrollment in
AC has decreased from 120
students in 1973 to a low of 34 in
1975. There are presently 49
students enrolled in the program.

Marshall said AC was originally
created without a budget. “It was
believed then,” said Marshall,
“that all of the departments would
contribute staff members and other
facilities.” The program is now
funded by CAS and Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. ,

According to the report, the total
annual cost of the program is
approximately $40,000 ‘per year.

Laurie Barnett, a senior and
former AC student, supports its
continuation but also recommends
that changes be made to make it a
more effective vehicle for students.
“The program helped me to get
aroundthe University bureaucracy
by teaching me to be assertive and
to not only sort out my needs but
also recognize how to fulfill them.”

Larry Epstein, assistant profes-
sor of chemistry and a member of
the CAS Council, said that AC
should be eliminated and the
monies channeled into an honors
program and a remedial education
program. - ‘ '

“I think small programs such as
AC, U-CEP and some of the
freshmen seminars, should be
discontinued,” Epstein said.
“Many of them are frivolous and
couldbe put under the direction of
one department.” -

‘ Since the inception of AC there
hasbeen debate over its usefulness

According to the Housing Ofﬁce ~ 2
statement, every attempt had been  
made to hold housing and food costs ’

at the minimum level. The room

students’ fees covering all costs.

Resident students will be requir- ‘

ed to pay a $100 room deposit fee

2,200 students pay the deposit,

whichever comes first, according to“ ’

JoAnn Gibbs, assistant director of

This would include, Gibbs said,
Holland Hall triples that are to be
expanded to accommodate quad-
ruple occupancy and lobbies that.
are converted to rooms at the
Lothrop Residence.
. The deadline for deposits will also
affect students receiving financial
aid. This year, special warnings

were sent to all students p a week in Q
advance of the invoices to allow time

for preparation. “People on
ﬁnancial aid should make sure that
they contact the Housing Ofﬁce as

soon as possible,” Gibbs stressed, .

because in certain cases the fee can

as an academic program. '

“I think the program gives
students a degree of self-direction
and teaches them not to reject the
structure of the University but to
work with a system regardless of its
structure,” Dean Marshall said.

A former AC student (who asked
that her name be withheld) said she
was not in favor of continuing the
program because it was hard for
many students to come from a
structured institution (high school)
to AC and then go back into a
structured environment again. “It
wasn’t just the differences in
structure but also the teachers who
were critical of professors who
didn’t share their beliefs and they
tended to instill these ideas into the
students,” she said.

The report stated the program .

was useful because it was designed
to create freedom, and self-discip-
line by integrating the academic
process with a social one.
“Education should be incorpora-
ted into all areas of life,” said AC

student Bob Wagoner. “It’s ironic
that education has no real social
interaction when you have to work
with others after you graduate.”
Some opponents to the program
said it is too ﬂexible because

students are not directed and

supervised enough.

A former AC student said she felt
AC students didn’t have the
responsibility of studying like other
students. “There are no exams or
term papers, just a course
description which they submit at the
terms end.”-

At the end of the brief,
recommendations were made by the
AC representatives on how to
strengthen the program:

(1) AC should be continued as a
permanent part of the College of
Arts and Sciences. '

(2) The program should be
expanded to allow students to enroll
for any two terms of their first two
years.

(3)  full-time program facilitator
should be appointed to the
program. -

Blast Inquest Raises Doubt

of his testimony, Sanner responded
to city lawyer Stanley Stein’s
question about the location of the
blast with the comment, “Yes, that
is where I found the chemicals.”

Sanner concurred with the
testimony of Sussman, chairman of
«the department which maintained
the EM lab—that the Langley blast
consisted of two explosions.
Sussman testified an explosion,
which traveled on a broad front from
its origin, lifted the auditorium’s
roof up, and an implosion sucked
the roof into a common circle into
the basement.

A tape recorder which had been
taping the lecture of assistant
professor Kathy Vergona, who had
been lecturing to an animal
physiology class in room‘223 at the
time of the blast, was played during
the hearing.

A soft rumble could be heard on
the tape, and then a loud bang.
Screams and muffled orders to ‘ ‘get
out” were heard before the tape
"faded out into a hissing roar. City
Homicide detective Ronald Free-
man identiﬁed the hissing sound as
a ruptured steam line.

officer, Allegheny County Coroner

The question is not, “Is Oakland trafﬁc dense?” but, “How can
Oakland’s traffic be made less dense?”

Granted, this is the University of Pittsburgh and not a rural situation
like Penn State. But trafﬁc need not'be this terrible, even in an urban

. area. The trafﬁc here is an aggravation to commuter and resident alike.

Traffic to and from Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, East Liberty, Garﬁeld
and Highland Park passes through Oakland. This is not necessary.

A solution under previous consideration was Skybus, a mass transit
system intended to reduce traffic between Pittsburgh and its suburbs.
Unfortunately, Skybus has gone from mass transit panacea to sick joke.

Something must be done to. reduce the traﬁic through Oaldand.
Priority must be assigned to any project with this as its goal. Whether
this project be a trolley that bends in the middle or improvement of an
alternate traﬁic route around the area, the city and the state must ﬁnd
the money, take the initiative and start the work.

Gimmicks like making Forbes and Fifth avenues one-way, or digging
up an additional 50 parking places from somewhere, offer but
short-lived relief. A major project is where the real solution can be
found.

Pitt has a lot of Harrisburg connections. Through these people and
organizations much lobbying can be carried out to inﬂuence those close
to the congestion problem.

Oakland’s number three ranking brings notoriety, not pride. The
administration should make alleviation of Pitt’s trafﬁc problem one of its
immediate goals.

-On Memorial Giving

The memorial fund drive for Carleen Curry and Patricia Hostetler,
victims of the Iangley Hall explosion, has collected $500 to date from
students, faculty and staff—without counting money pledged by
l:'raternities.

Those donating, whether they gave a dime or a dollar, are to be
commended. For those who haven’t—the drive is not yet over. It is not
too late to send a donation, no matter how humble it may be.

Credit can be given to the administration for the material help it has
given to the cormnittee—in the form of oflice supplies, promotion and
general cooperation.

However, the goal of this ad hoc committee is $5,000 and only $500 has
While collections have been made on the
departmental level, the University itself has yet to make a contribution.
Pitt need not make up the goal deﬁcit; merely matching the money
collected would be appropriate.

Collection has been limited to Pitt's campus. That does not mean that

 the creation of this memorial should be the exclusive task of students,

faculty and staff.

What about the corporation executives on Pitt’s Board of Trustees?
Certainly $500 would be a mere pittance to their company’s coffers.

The act of matching funds collected would deﬁnitely demonstrate the
regret of the University in the wake of last month's tragedy.

Has Society Cone Stale?  

BY LEN ROMBERG

America has gone to sleep
socially, politically and culturally.
After experiencing social turbu-
lance in the mid-60’s—Vietnam,
political disruption and economic
chaos—the sun has set over the
horizon of a people who have had
enough.

Every few years a new era
depicting the nation enters, leaving
its mark in memories and history
books. The years we are not wading
through are bound to be remember-
ed as years of stagnation and a love
of nostalgia.

The 1950’s were ﬁlled with trends
and events well known to those who
were not even around during those
years. Everyone has heard of
McCarthyism. “I Like Ike,” the
Sputnik-Cold War peak and most
important-—high school antics. A

Likewise, “the Great Society,”
war on poverty, Gemini and Apollo,
civil rights, Vietnam and “Hair”
are obvious symbols of the 60’s.
Since Watergate, our atmosphere
has cooled, but in the process it has
also gone stale.

College campuses are the quiet-
est they have ever been. Being a
freshman, I have yet to see a real
live protest, except for those

 

dramatized before television cam-
eras. Having domestic‘ peace is by
no means bad, but 100 percent

Med-X letter

 

 

complacency is worse. ,
Few people appear to care about
our environment anymore. Talking
about pollution today is almost
archaic. Yet the Pittsburgh Press
printed a brief article in which the
National Wildlife Federation said
the overall quality of America’s
environment declined for the
seventh consecutive year in 1976.

While the quality of water,
wildlife, living space, soil and
minerals declined, the federation
noted only a slight improvement in
air quality. These trivial facts were
found in a three-inch news ﬁller on
page six.

To make matters worse, only two
days ago the auto companies" told
Congress they cannot meet the 1979
exhaust emissions standards. They

  

told Congress to change the law or
the industry will shut down.

Minorities’ civil rights and the
Equal Rights Amendment appear to
be at a standstill.

Reasons for these‘ non-occurren-
ces are not too difﬁcult to ﬁnd. The
recession and energy shortage are
probably the two biggest culprits,
but there may be others. Face
facts—who can think of equal rights
;when the thermostat reads 45
degrees? Clean air just isn’t
important when your job is
threatened. ‘

The economic blues appear to
have spilled over into other areas.

There may be no direct relation, but
nostalgia has sprung up like Texas
oil, replacing creativity and vitality.
Where would TV be without
“Happy Days?”

‘ ‘That’ s Entertainment’ ’ relived
past show biz days while Broadway
theatres are now becoming clutter-
ed with revivals, suffering from a
shortage of good new shows.
Television is ﬁlled with a variety of
garbage called police shows and
recycled situation comedies.

Whether these present days
represent a brief dry spell or a
deﬁnite trend is unknown; that will
only be realized years from now.
The important aspect to be aware of
is that we may have gone stale and
the potential to break the spell is
enormous. The recent showing of
“Rcots,” perhaps a new style of
TV, _is deﬁnite proof of this
potential. I

Be it a revival in space

exploration or a new trend in
entertainment, some kind of event
could reap great social proﬁt by
pulling the nation out of a slump just
months after an already long-
forgotten Bicentennial.

Program Places Minorities  

We are prompted by the recent
letter written by Dr. Robert Glew,
Associate "Professor, School of
Medicine to submit this letter to the
Pitt News. Dr. Glew’s‘ most recent

‘letter has made it obvious to Project

Med-x, that despite our earnest
attempts to publicize our program,
we are still unknown in some parts
of the University.

Our purpose now is to inform all
interested parties about Project
Med-x, so that on future occasions,
white and black students alike may
participate (and the University’s
faculty members may refer students
to us).

Project Med-x originated in

September 1974 as a cure for the '

pre-professional’s most common
complaint, ‘‘...I need clinical
experience, but I can't seem to ﬁnd
a suitable opportunity.” It took
nearly six months to organize this
program. In April of 1975, 40
students (undergraduate pre-meds,
pre-dents, pre-physical therapy,
pre-respiratory therapy and pre-
pharmacy students) were placed at
Shadyside Hospital and the Pitts-
burgh Free Clinic to do volunteer
work as emergency room techni-
cians, cardiogram technicians,
radiology department assistants,
primary coronary care aids, general
nursing aids, counselors and the list
is endless. These positions were
negotiated with the hospitals. (We

- have considered‘ and" investigated
-_ all the legal implic_a_tion.s and insure
each student ‘with“$"1 million dollars
liability coverage.) . » The -po_sitions'{'.
were av'v‘arded'to those students- ‘who “'

applied and ‘were screened. by

Project Med-x student steering‘

committee. It is well worth noting
that the steering committee of this
program initially included one
female white co-ordinator, two male
white assistants and two female
black assistants. In addition, the
pilot group included a ratio of nearly
50/50 black to white students.

Each term since the spring of
1975 (or for the last ﬁve consecutive
terms) more and more students
have been placed in the city's
hospitals and clinics. Nearly 400
students have been placed by
Project Med-x in 10 city hospitals.
This represents thousands of hours
of "time given to health care
institutions in return for the
students’ experience beneﬁts. Our
expansion has allowed,for place-
ment in St. Francis General
Hospital, St. Francis Renal Dialysis
Unit, Pittsburgh Hospital, Magee
Womens Hospital, Mercy Hospital,
Monteﬁore Hospital, St. Margar-
et’s Hospital and The Central Blood
Bank. Dental Clinic experience is
available for the interested pre-
dental students.

Our members do much more than‘
a typical volunteer. They are
permitted to observe whatever
activities they wish. as long as they
complete their own duty assign-
ments. Also, we have programs
which allow students to round with
physicians. observe surgery and

“we will always be indebted to Ms,
_ Jae Brown. ‘V/olunteer,Director) that, «V by ,,

all students may attend. The
lectures are given by staff
physicians, administrators and
directors. These lectures are
geared at the pre-professional level
to give the student a professional’s
personal insight into medicine and
related ﬁelds. The next lecture is
scheduled for February 22, 1977,
Tuesday; the topic is ‘clinical
engineering.

Had this been all we had done, it
would have been a giant step
forward for pre-professional stu-
dents, but we did much more. We
set up an evaluation system for all
members. They could be evaluated
every four months, the evaluation
was then sent to the Pitt YMCA (the
program’s sponsor) where they are
ﬁled for the student and held until
the student needs them to send to
his/her professional school.
Secondly, we maintain a totally
integrated committee and member-
ship, demonstrating that discrimi-
nation and negative discrimination

can be totally avoided...our interest
is the student experience, not color.
not color.

_ Currently. Project Med-x is
intercollegiate. We work with
Carnegie-Mellon University, Car-
low College and Chatham College in
an ongoing effort to involve all area
students in this unique educational

experience. Our steering commit- -

tee consists of one female white
Coordinator. four black and four
white assistants. Our record stands
as proof that clinical experiencejs

Lobbyist’s Money

Is Questioned

Members of the University
community should take note of
recently published information that
former State Senator Thomas
Lamb, recently appointed the
University’s chief lobbyist at a
salary in excess of $40,000, spent
ﬁve days in Palm Beach, Florida,
attending a conference of the state’ s
principal insurance lobby.

If the University paid Lamb’s
expenses, there are questions to be
asked. If the lobby paid his
expenses, there are questions to be
asked. If he paid his own expenses,
all of them, we are left to wonder if
this is the job he is collecting more
than $40,000 to perform.

of all abortions. One in four teenage
women has a baby in her teen years.
Teenage mothers are at a
disadvantage socially and economi-
cally; an unplanned pregnancy may
seriously disrupt their life plans.
Most teenage mothers never finish
school, thereby eliminating oppor-
tunities for job-related training and
increasing their chances of unem-
ployment. Teenagers who marry as
a result of pregnancy are three
times more likely to separate from
their spouses than other teenage
couples. In addition to being
economically disadvantaged, teen-
age mothers and their infants face
substantially higher health risks.
The great majority of teenagers
do not want to become pregnant.
Nevertheless, few sexually active
teenagers consistently use effective
contraceptive methods. Many
teenagers are inaccurately inform-
ed of the risk of pregnancy and
correct contraceptive use. In many
areas, family planning services are
unavailable or highly unaccessible
for teens. Eleven million teenagers
are estimated to be sexually active.

BY CRIS HALL

By 3:30 p.m. yesterday, a stifling
combination of heat and beer-
supplied humidity hung over and
clung to the growing crowd at the
Student Union Board-sponsored
third annual Beer Festival in the
S.U. ballroom. The standing-on-
the-floor-only throng (standing on
the tables had been outlawed) was
awaiting the start of the celebrity-

studded beer tasting contest,"

already 15 minutes delayed.

Five minutes later the crowd,
prompted by the oppressive atmos-
phere and recently consumed brew,
expressed its impatience vocally.
The taps had been shut off for
sonfetime, so “We want beer”
became a droning chant.

A few minutes after that, there
still was no beer before the six
contestants. “C’mon,” shouted a
unified crowd of dazed onlookers,
“Let’s go.”

After a short rest, the crowd
again broke into chant. Someone
yelled, “chug,” and everyone
yelled “chug.”

At 3:45, the crowd was ready to
storm the taps. “We want beer”
became a deafening roar.

It was under these conditions that

the festival’s battle of the brew~

began.

Eight persons were expected to
compete; six made it. Seated on the
ballroom stage were: Bill Hillgrove,
WTAE sportscaster (the “voice of

the Panthers”) and last year’s
second-place ﬁnisher; Bob Bran-
son, KDKA-TV newsman; Nellie
King, Duquesne University sports
information director; Alfred Moye,
vice chancellor for student affairs;
Robert Marshall, CAS dean; and
Joseph Dutton, vice chancellor for
business and ﬁnance.

The no-shows were KDKA-TV‘
sportscaster Greg Benedetti and
health professions Vice Chancellor
Nathan Stark.

Six 12-oz. samples of beer,
contained in numbered plastic cups,
were placed before each contestant,
along with a list of answers from
which to choose.

The choices were Pabst, Iron
City, Schlitz, Millers, Genessee
Cream Ale and Guinness Harp.
And, according to the contestants,
they were difficult choices.

“Nothing in the world could taste
as much alike as these beers,”
claimed Moye, who holds an
interest in Craig St.’s Portfolio
lounge. ‘‘I’m just guessing-I
really have no idea which is which. ’ ’

“You think you have it master-
ed,” said Hillgrove between
healthy swallows, “and then you
start to worry—you begin to
second-guess and get all screwed
up. You're better off to go with your‘
first impression, but if you win
something like this, you’re lucky.”

Hillgrove was the ranking
veteran of this year’s panel since
last year’s winner, WIIC-TV
newsman Adam Lynch, did not
return. “Adam claims he's an
expert,” said Hillgrove. “I don’t
know, but I think it’s really mind
games. He won last year because he
guessed Schlitz and I guessed
Schmidt’s. I know- one thing,
though—neither of us had Coor’s.”

Dutton had one complaint, but
seemed happy—-especially after

 
 

 

._ 

“testing” each offering thoroughly. ,

“The volume is short,” he said.
“But the selection is great. Sure
beats sitting in the office. Why, I
think this is the greatest thing to
happen to the University of
Pittsburgh since the Sugar Bowl.
We shouldﬂoit every day.”

Asked if he was competing as a
representative of the University or
as a matter of personal pride-,
Dutton was concise. ‘‘I’m here to,
drink beer.”

“I’m not putting my personal
pride on anything like this,” said
Moye. “So I guess I’m here as a
representative of the University.”f

“l have never been so embarr-
assed in my entire life,” claimed
Marshall in a Boston accent. “But I
won’t get drunk—all you do is roll a
little of each sample on your tongue,
so you really don’t drink all that
much.” '

Few other contestants took
Marshall's advice. Long, hearty
swallows were used as a basis for
comparison.

“I’d better not get drunk,‘ since I
have to drive home,”. said King.
“But the dunk is back in college
basketball this year, so I'm goingto
bring back the drunk.” A

“I have to do the six o’clock news
on channel four,” laughed Hill-

The judges asked for the
contestants’ ﬁndings. Marshall
submitted his quickly, saying,
“Yes, I’m done—forever! ”

The others soon followed and the
winners were announced. Branson,
Marshall, Hillgrove and Dutton had

“tied for the lead—with two correct
responses apiece. King got one
right. Moye was shut out.

“Let’s have a chug-off,” scream-
ed Branson, with gleaming eyes.

But that was not the case. A tie-
breaking selection was placed
before each contestant, followed by
another.

Marshall again was the first to
finish. Dutton lingered over his
choices, as did Hillgrove. Branson
was last. King had left, claiming an
appointment, but Moye stayed on

stage, finishing his samples and
piling abuse on Hillgrove.

“Hillgrove is weak,” cried Moye.
“Get him away from Iron City and
he doesn't know what he’s talking
about.”

“Oh, yeah?" retorted Hillgrove,
whose mood prevented him from
anger. “Why, the reason Moye
finished last is because one of his
choices was scotch and soda.”

The four remaining competitors
compared answers. Rumors ﬂew
about.

“I've been eliminated,” scream-
ed a fearful Marshall when
informed he was out of the running.
“Oh, I’m embarrassed.”

And so, apparently, there were
three. A student helper announced
the results.

Third place went to Hill grove, the

    

JOE DUON

crowd's favorite. “l’ve slipped a
place in a year,” he said. “That’s
what age will do to you.”

The second-place mug belonged
to Dutton, who responded to the
announcement with a mad grin.

Now all eyes were on Branson. He

was the apparent winner, and
waited expectantly.

“And the winner is...Robert

Marshall. ’<’

The rumor-mongers had been
wrong. Marshall not only was in it,
but he also was the winner. The

    

ALFRED MOYE

first-place mug was his. "

“I’m still embarrassed,” he told
the audience, but they didn’t hear
him. Someone had yelled, “turn on
the taps,” and the audience
returned to its task of getting drunk
enough to forget the third annual
beer tasting contest.

Everyone Was Winner

BY K. GERALD

College students love beer. ‘ For
some strange reason, they like
nothing better than a cold, bubbly,
frosty mug ofmoh my. It’s
delicious.

But it’s not just beer that attracts
droves of drooling students to Pitt’s

’ Annual Beer Festival. It’s a blast, if
L you’ll pardon the expression.

Pitt is not, to say the least,
notorious for being a hub of social
activity. The biggest event of a

typical school year in Oakland is a
candlelight ravioli dinner in the
Towers cafeteria.

Except, that is, for once a year.
One day out of 365, someone sees fit
to conduct the sort of gala affair that
college students crave with a deep
passion. *

They are given beer, music and a
big room in which to be rowdy. And
the students love it.

The Student Union ballroom—-
that dark, dusty place few people
ever see after orientation—yester-
day was transformed into a
magnificent barroom fit for a legion
of alcoholics. '

' The walls, usually stacked high
with folded tables and cluttered

with half-eaten lunches, were lined

with eight or 10 tiny bars complete
with refrigerated kegs, posters and
dozens of knick-knacks commemor-
ating the day of drunkenness.

What were these students—hun-
dreds, maybe thousands—doing
drinking the forbidden brew on a
schoolnight? As senior Jerry
Zidanic summarized it, “I’m
getting drunk out of my (deleted)
mind. What the (de‘e.ted( do you
think I’m doing?” efed)

The tradition of the Pitt -Beer
Festival goes back several years.
The founder, an un-mentionable
University administrator, ‘first sug-
gested the beerblast more than ﬁve
years ago. (He thought, of course,

that no hard-working, dedicated .

student would drink beer rather
than read a good book. Which
would mean the festival would yield
about 30 kegs for his own
refrigerator.)

He was more than ﬂabbergasted
when some 8,000 Pitt students,
carrying bucket to cart home
reinforcements, jammed the Stu-

Iron City’s “Big Al’’
Taps Pitt’s Soft Spot

BY JIMMY LOVE

A favorite attraction at Pitt's
Annual Beer Tasting Festival is
TV’s rolly-pollvy Iron City beer man.
“Big Al” Luccioni.

To the satisfaction of most every
Iron City fan who attended this
year's festival, held in the Student
Union Ballroom, Luccioni made his
annual appearance and, as always,
was very happy to be “pouring on
the Iron," and plenty of it, too.

Although this year Luccioni was
kept very busy behind the
proverbial tap, having little time to
talk at length with students, two

years ago—during Pitt’s First
Annual Beer Festival—Luccioni
took a few minutes after a

considerably late arrival to discuss,
with those students still sober
enough to pay attention, his
background, especially his involve-
ment with Iron City’s beer
commercials.

“I’m a draft beer ‘spashulist,’ an
expert on draft beer systems,” he
began. “Say for example one

0’ yunz has a bar and you're
running’ Iron in your tap. If
.somethin’s wrong with your sys-
tem, I git called out to correct the
situation.”

Some of the problems ‘you
encounter with draft beer are flat
beer (no bubbles), wild beer (all
bubbles), and off-taste beer,
Luccioni says.

“For example,” he said, “one
December night a few years back I
got a call to go up to Seven Springs
to check out the tap in the lounge.
They couldn’t git their system goin’
right.”

What Al expected from the Seven
Springs call was to get out of the
house for a few hours, tame some
wild ' beer and get some extra
overtime tacked -onto his next
paycheck. But by the time he
ﬁnished the job, “it was snowin’ to
beat hell and" there I was without no
snow ‘tahrs’ to git me home.” He
spent the balance of the weekend at
the lodge, “trapped,” if you will,
with a convention of female school
teachers. .

That weekend was the beginning

of Big Al's career in commercials.
When the public relations staff at
Pittsburgh Brewing Company (Iron
City's Brewery) heard about
Luccioni's Seven Springs weekend,
it discovered it had a great new
angle for TV commercials.

Within a few weeks of the Seven
Springs weekend, Luccioni found
himself in front of the cameras,
shooting his first ad. The
‘commercial, a re-enactment of the
Seven Springs story, put forth the
simple ethic that Iran City’s draft
beer specialist will go out of his way
to make sure Pittsburghers can
“pour on the Iron.”

The response to‘ the ad was
overwhelmingly positive, precisely
because Luccioni’s diction was
loaded with Pittsburgh-isms and
because his overall performance
was awkward and choppy.

George Marino, Iron City’s sales
manager, further explained the
success of Luccioni’s first commer-
cial. “When you talk about Al, it's
not a question of who identiﬁes with
him; rather, it's more a question of
who doesn’t identify with him.
Everybody in the area knows an Al
Luccioni type. That’s not true of a
lot of local ad personalities.”

After the success of the first
commercial, the brewery manage’-
ment realized Luccioni could do
more for the company than take
bubbles out of draft beer, so it made
him Iron City Beer’s promotional
man. He soon started attending
promotional parties to mingle and
drink Iron City Beer with the public.

Big Al attended one such party at
Pitt’s Pi Kappa A1pha’s September,
1973, rush party. Luccioni was a big
hit at the party. Throughout the
evening he was surrounded by
groups of semi-drunk students.

At the time of the party at Pika’s
Belleﬁeld Street House, he was
attending about ﬁve such bashes
weekly and was booked solid for
months in advance. Invariably, Big
Al arrived at these affairs laden with

“Big Al”
specialist-tumed-TV star, made his portly appearance
at the Beer Festival yesterday in the Student Union

eight-by-ten glossies of himself,
some other company freebies and,
of course, a keg or two of
“Pittsburgh’s Number One (and
only) Beer.” His party attire
consisted of a black-and-white
referee shirt and black pants, his
original TV costume.

Luccioni, who describes himself
to be somewhere “on the tough side
of ﬁfty,” is married, with two
children. He still lives in the same
house he bought with his wife soon
after he was honorably discharged
from the Marines in 1.946.

Luccioni was born and raised in
Uniontown, where his father
worked in the local coal mines. Like
most kids who grew up during the
depression in mining towns, Big Al
learned to ﬁght early in his life.
Later, as a Marine in the South
Paciﬁc during World War II,
Luccioni fought his way to an
impressive 15-0 boxing record.
“Twelve of them were knockouts,”
he adds with a sparkle in his eye.

Luccioni, Iron City beer’s draft

today, although his body is
swaddled in layers of fat (it’s his
unofﬁcial party policy always to
have a glass of Iron City in hand), he
still has the build of a powerful man.
His long, hooked nose and thick
gray hair give him the appearance
of a Maﬁa hard guy.

Big Al is anything but a hard guy,
though. With his broad grin, deep
laugh, friendly handshake and
heavy Pittsburgh dialect, Luccioni
as the Iron City Beer man, has been
transformed from a dumpy hourly
wage draft beer ‘spashulist’ into a
well-tailored, well-paid TV person-
ality. No doubt he has proﬁted
greatly from his numerous com-
mercials as well as the hundreds of
“Party with Big Al Nights” he has
attended. And through it all, even
yesterday's beer festival, Luccioni
manages to look as if he’s having a
good time. From his behavior, it is
apparent he may be having a good
time.

One thing’sfor sure; he sure sells
alot of beer. How? “Ijust try to be
local, that’s all,” he says.

once again proved popular with the Pitt students while
autographing pictures, shaking hands and answering
“glad to know ya’s.”

Aside from the illustrious panel of

seemed the only persons able to
appreciate the day’s activities.

in heavily accented English, to his
wife. “Is this the University? What

‘Backspace’ Going Forward

BY MARIA L. CANTINI

Literary magazines at Pitt have

' seen their good times and bad.

“Ideas and Figures” was the

' longest running but many felt it was

too traditional and that it was time
for a change. This change resulted
in a staff more intent on being
Dadaistic than on representing
good and diverse writing. Then last
year a small group of students with
a lot of determination were able to

find both financial support and good

  

/.,«—.s.« '/,:.....".'..av-rx.a«../..o.../»i...

,‘ r“ I‘.

 

share

their work. The result was
“Backspace.” The first issue was‘
good but nothing spectacular. This
‘ year's, however, has both a poetry
and fiction editor, a graphic
coordinator and a group of

interested and concerned staff
members.

As far as appearances go, this
issue is made unappealing and dull
by its cover. But inside there is a
selective representation of many
talents. There is a great variety in
poetry, ﬁction, short prose and
social commentary. I felt as ifl was
seeing several pictures, some
pleasing and some a sharp jolt to my
senses. But this is the ultimate
purpose of a literary magazine. As
the editors freely admit: “We’ve
represented some writer’s experi-
ments, some writer’s parents, some
writer’s politics, some writer’s
crafted fun.” Whether you share
their views or not, it is good to see
such "a diverse grouping of
experiences grouped so well.

Most of the 25 poems and nine
prose pieces comprising this issue
show refinement, quality and
discretion. While some are better
stylistically, others relate more fully
to one’s own experiences. The best
of the poetry and prose do, both. I
ﬁnd it difficult to judge one genre
better than the other because both
offer good, fresh approaches. The
one distinction I do ﬁnd, however, is
the prose has a more refined and
controlled experimental technique
while the poetry covers a much

broader realm of subject and

experience. But the two nicely
contrast one another.

Comedy: Risque, Yes

But Degrading Never

BY MREA CSORBA
AND DEANNA LOUISE

Hey, big spender...With cat eyes
and arms crocked at the elbows,
parodying “boobs out to here,”
denim-clad Barbara Russell slithers
down an imaginary stripper runway
in an equally imaginary scuba-tight
gown.

For comedienne Barbara, of the
(Don) “Brockett and Barbara"
comedy duo, risque material is
sometimes O.K. But heavy blue
material at the expense of women is
quite another thing—although she
doesn't readily admit it.

Russell is au natural, letting most
of her inhibitions, repressions and
frustrations surface in her comedy
act. But the glibness she maintains
while making light of her obscure
assignments—“they were in de
woods’ ’—or while joking how rarely
her nine-year old daughter stays
below Mom's threshold level-
falters when pressed about her
feelings on “blue” material.

“During heavy blue material,
Don excuses me from the stage. I

.don’t mind. I’d probably have a
cerebral hemmorrage if I stayed,”
she says ﬂippantly, but with a vague
tremble as she explains.

“When the audience calls for
blue material, they wanna talk
about women, and they wanna talk
about women in a way I don’t wanna
hear.”

Russell is no debutante to smokey
rooms. She looks like she could take
it when the going gets tough and th
drinking «heavy. ~ , 

 

thrown at me.’

 

She looks thirty-ish, though an
account of her potpourri career puts
her age closer to forty-five. A Pitts-
burgh product, she taught grade
school in Penn Hills for 10 years and
played summer stock before
teaming up with Brockett, her
partner of 16 years. She debuted as
director at the Apple Hill Playhouse
this summer.

‘‘I do feminist material.
mine’s a softer approach,” Russell
said.

“The choice is mine to leave the
stage when the material gets too
blue for me,” she says.

Her glib speech breaks a little.
Staccato phrases blurt forward. She
paces now behind the lecturn.

“I do “We as Women” (a routine
about women) in front of women’s
groups. Some women can hold their
own with feminist material in front
of men’s clubs. They can do
that...When you unload angry
material on an audience you got to
expect an angry return. Some
comediennes can handle that...”

She insists she has a feminist
consciousness. “I agree with
feminist material...I agree with
those women...But I don’t want to
do that,” she said and paused.
After the rush of breathless
phrases. her pause indicated her
stock of explanations had run dry.

. She slouches over the lecturn and
sighs. Her broad shoulders slump.
“I guess I really don’t have the guts
to do it, ” she said and tried to laugh
it away. “I guess I don’t wantjstuff

, .

Some of my more mellow
moments were touched off by
poems like Mark Wolynn’s “In
Father’s '42 Photograph,” an
honest and quite evocative portrait
of his father. Similarly, the subtle
imagery yet sophisticated tone and
craft of Steve Denning’s poems left
me with memorable sensory
impressions. The one untitled
poem of the found poem genre is in
letter form and describes the poet’s

‘ parents and their lifestyle in a
moving way. “Puget Sound” is a
sharp, sensitively drawn picture of a
place and an experience. ‘

The serious and the playful in
style and tone are carefully blended
by Paula Acker. “Original Sin” by
Acker is initially light but moves

AnotherWord for Different ,

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Every time I hear the misused
musical term “progressive” ap-
plied to any piece of work that is
even slightly different than what
could‘ be called tlie mainstream of
contemporary music, I cringe.

What exactly is progressive
music? Could third generation
space-rock practitioners be called
progressive?_ Should leather and
airplane glue-snifﬁng acts such as
Patti Smith or the Ramones have
this label placed upon them? How
about disco?

Progressive music to me is Chuck
Berry. Progressive music isithe

Beatles, the Stones and Dylan. It’s
Lake and

Yes and Emerson,

Palmer.,

  
   

All of the above are artists who
don’t just jump on any traditional
musical bandwagon. Instead, they
create a bandwagon of their own to
which others eventually flock like
flies. They're considered progres-
sive because what they do is
radically different from the tastes
and trends which preceded them.

David Bowie, Gary Wright and
Steve Hillage have all released
albums recently which are getting a
fair share of progressive acclaim
from the media and their respective
record companies. However,
under careful scrutiny, all three
albums come off as simply
derivative.

     

Bowie, the musical vagabond of ‘

the‘70’s, is perhaps the all-time
musical rip-off champ—an unques-
tionable master at manipulating the
media.

He took glitter rock, created for
the most part by the lovely. Alice
Cooper, and furthered it to the limit
with the pronouncement of his
.'..bi-sexuality," I . . .— -

AJ-

 

adapter, able to change and profit

 

But everyone grew tired of that
bag, including Bowie himself. In
’74 he turned into a white soul
singer. Then came his disco image.
Now Bowie is turning more_ toward
synthetic-electronic rock and is
producinga sound that Brian Eno,
Kraftwerk and other such mechani-
cal musicians have been doing for
years. i

“Low,” Bowie’s newest release,
is pleasant to listen to but it lacks
emotion. “Low” has the same sort
of disturbing quality you can hear in
Muzak when you’re choking on a
pickle in the Burger Chef. In fact,
“Low’ ’ seems to be Bowie’s private
joke pointing at the absurdity of the
record buying public. '

Call Bowie a fag, call him a poof,
call him cold and calculating; but
don’t ever call him dumb. If
Bowie—the ultimate rock n’ roll

Gary Wright, David Bowie and Steve Hillage are three musicians

0-?
on his follow-up, the much hyped
and equally lacking, “The Light of
Smiles.”

It’s beyond me how anyone can
manage to stay awake while

listening to Wright’s recent solo
efforts. Both are time albums ﬁlled

  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 

considered by some to be “progressive.” While Wright’s and Bowie’s
newest releases are less than original, -'Hillage’s “L” sparks of

innovation.
from any new musical innovation-
turned his intelligent mind to
politics, he probably would be our
man in the White House before we
could utter a chorus of “Diamond
Dogs.”

Gary Wright used to be a good
musician-songwriter. Back in the
late 60’s and early 70's when he was
with Spooky Tooth, the man showed
his admirable talents in both areas.

But with his - last album,
“Dreamweaver,”, Wright has let

with obscure songs about Wright’s
fairy-tale visions of space, set to a
background of annoying keyboards
and his droning vocals." It’s perfect
for teenyboppers trying to broaden
their horizons by listening to 13Q.
Wright can't sing, but since we
told him he could when we bought
“Dreamweaver,” the man isn’t
about to fudge up a good thing. But

New Issue ofStudent Work  

(Continued from Page 10)
Ratcatcher (Double Exposure)
takes us into the poet’s life and his
experiences in sixteen different
ways with different people. His
end, naturally, is to try to catch
them all and hold onto them. The
piece would read better without the
large titles and scattered layout.

The experimental style is most
obvious in Dick Cameron’s “Two-
speak.” Several readings of the
poem still leave me bafﬂed and
confused. Without the speaker's
words, typed in bold face print, the
poem is more meaningful to me.
Robert Welsh and Keith Hall begin
and end the collection with their
poems. Each conveys a rich and
well sustained sense of earth,
space,’ and time.

to be released on this side of the
Atlantic.

“L” is a fine synthesis of cosmic-
oriented songs which use electric
rock as a base. i

Hillage employs an intelligent
blend of Robin Trower-like guitar
phrasings coupled with the “Eng-
lish country cottage” recording
techniques pioneered by Traffic.
However, if the mystical side of
your being isn’t what it might he,
stay away from the album.‘

“L” cannot be classified as an-

original piece of work because of so
many of the obvious derivative
inﬂuences. However, the man is
different. Hillage, more than any
other “progressive” artist, bears
watching.

ELO e
Next Week's
Arena Guest

Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)
will be performing Thursday,
February 17, at 7:30 p.m. at the
Civic Arena. Along with ELO will
be special guest guitarist, Steve
Hillage, who will be playing songs
from his second album “L”.

Electric Light Orchestra, with
four gold albums behind them,
began with the innovating force of
guitarist, composer, vocalist and
songwriter, Jeff Lynne. By using
strings and some classical inﬂuence
in a rock and roll group, ELO has

found a formula that others in the

business ﬁnd hard to duplicate.
ELO’s music has often been
termed “classical rock.” Lynne

objects to being categorized as

such, “I think our music borders on
a lot of styles."

Along with Lynne, ELO’ consists
of Bev Bevan. drums; Richard
Tandy, keyboards;Kelly Groucutt.
bass; Mike Kaminski, violin;
Melvin Gale and Hugh McDowell,

cellos.
ELO will be bringing their new

laser to Pittsburgh, which adds the
ﬁnal touch to their light show. They
will be performing cuts from their
latest album. “A New World
Record." plus such hits as
“Showdown." “Boy Blue." —*‘EviI

fg~A -

The prose has equal merit as a
body of style, tone and sophistica-
tion. Two faculty members,
Michael Henderson and Pamela
McCorduck, are represented.
Henderson's “The Parrot’s Nest”
is a short but intense study of an
ex-President exiled by his own
loneliness in his own country. “The
Only Surviving Soldier of Vietnam
as Economist" is McCorduck’s
scathing commentary against those
men whose own sense of courage,
pride and honor isolated them from
everyone and everything else.
Peter Oresiek. with his “Calculus
And The Corporate State” offers a
larger view of the economics of
order that ultimately lead to
disorder.

A well-balanced contrast in style
and craft is found in Alex Levin’s
“The Gift.” Here, the protagonist
Peter, must confront the cruelest of
realitiesedeath. Levin takes us
into Peter’s consciousness, back
and forth through time, in a
carefully paced and well sustained
manner. The gift is not a gift at all,
rather it is one of those things
drawing us back into the starkness
of reality. «

The world of people and objects is
the subject of Ron Nyswaner’s
“White Carpet.” The story evolves

around a young couple whose lives
are sometimes controlled and
nearly ruined because of a false
sense of pride and values. Nys-
waner leads us into the lives of
Sandy and John in a graphic and
realistic way. The picture shifts and
changes then comes to a standstill
when Sandy must accept her life at
its best and worst.

Two autobiographical pieces are
Janet Lang’s “The Words Change
It” and Duncan Harrington’s “The
Story User.” Each is a story about
the writer trying to accept his
limitations and reject those which

‘ are obstacles to his way of life. As

Lang writes her own story, she feels
it may be changed by the words she
uses or those who change the
meaning in the words. Her free
ﬂowing consciousness takes her
forward and backward through a
world of objects and people
interrupted by men, parents and
obligations.

All in all, I was impressed with
the content, the variation and
experimentation in style and the
arrangement of poetry with prose
and the selectivity in both. The
technical difficulties are minor and
can be adjusted, but the cover does
areal injustice to the content. ,

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.—It
was the same old story for Coach
Tim Grgurich’s Panther roundbal-
lers Wednesday night, only the
scene was different. This time Pitt
brought its erratic show to the West

. Virginia Coliseum in Morgantown,
West Virginia, and were soundly
thrashed by the WVU Mountain-
eers, 90-69.

The Panthers once again played
one excellent half of basketball.
Unfortunately, two decent halves

“ are needed to win a game. Pitt came

out of the locker room at the half
trailing only 39-37 and then fell
completely apart. Everything the
Panthers did right in the ﬁrst half,
they did wrong in the second half.

“We just had a complete

M breakdown in the second half,’ ’ said

Grgurich. “We played well, very
well, in the ﬁrst half. We pressed
well, took our time, and got the good
shots.”

The Panthers were tough in the’

opening half, connecting on 62

percent of their ﬁeld goal tries and
pressuring WVU well after switch-
ing to a man-to-man defense,
abandoning the zone they showed in
the early going.

The Mountaineers raised their
Eastern Collegiate Basketball
League (ECBL) record to 5-3 (13-7

overall) and lead the Western
Division by three and a half games.
Pitt fell to 0-6 in league play and
4-16 on the season.

It is now very likely that on March
2, Philadelphia’s Spectrum will be
the site of the next Pitt-WVU
matchup, where the division’s
number one (WVU) and number
four (Pitt) teams will be paired in

the opening round.
Now, if Grgurich can just get the
ECBL officials to limit the games to

,20 minute affairs, the Panthers can .

survive the tournament. But, in any
game of 40 minutes duration, Pitt
just cannot seem to avoid some
periods of very poor play, and
consequently suffer loss after loss.

Gettin’ Around

 

Another Verse Of
A Familiar Tune

BY s'.rEvE SYBERT
Sports Editor

Two novice reporters, notepads in hand, creep silently around the

empty gymnasium.

“Sh..sh. Who’s that?” one’asks the other.
“Watch it—that’s them. Houseﬁeld and Athelon.”

“Well, I'll be a...”
“Sh..sh. Get down quick.”

The two journalists-turned-spies crawl beneath the bleachers like a

pair of GI’s slithering through barbed wire, pencils clutched between

their determined teeth.

Athletic Director Fitz Houseﬁeld and track coach Dick Athelon appear
at an entrance. Houseﬁeld walks into the gymnasium, stops abruptly,
turns and paces back. He covers his feverish face with chilled hands.

“But how?.” he inquires, hands sliding downwards to his pockets.

“How did they ﬁnd out?”

“Geez,” fumes Athelon. “Them ’ere security guards. One of ’em

found a piece o’tape on the turn-style. What we gonna do? Now them
’ere blasted reporters been snoopin’ around. We gotta do some...”

“Wait! Let me think a minute. We’ve got to cover up this mess.
Everyone thinks the track meet was cancelled. We’ve got to make them
believe it. How’d we look if people are freezing to death in their homes,
while we're here in a warm building holding a track meet. We’ve got to
hush the media about this, Dick, and We’ve got to make people believe
the library and the Student Union WERE open. And most of all, We’ve
got to get those two reporters.{’

“Geez. Maybe some o’my sprinters can run ’em down and we can

_ make javelin catchers out_ of ’em for the outdoor season.”

“No, that wouldn't do-—too messy. Take all the results and burn
them. And tell all the other coaches to do the same. Let those reporters
sift through the ashes if they want. And lock up all the track and ﬁeld
equipment. Make the people think"‘we’ve discontinued our track
program here and from now on we'll schedule all away meets.”

“Geez. That’ll just be another waste o'energy, won’t it?” A

“Yes, but it will save us embarrassment at least, and think of all the
nice places the boys will get to see—Ann Arbor, Michigan; Kent, Ohio;
Morgantown; Slippery Rock. They could write a best-selling travel
guide to earn money for their trips."

‘ ‘Geez. But what about this meet we just held. People’ll think we're a
bunch o'crooks." V

“I am not a crook. You’ll stand by that, won’t you?"

“Geez...well...yea."

“We'll just term the meet as ‘unofficial’ and soon everyone will forget
about it."

“Geez. Ain't so bad we had the meet, Fitz, it's our coverin’ up the
thing that's drawing them reporters ’round.”

“Yea, and they know all about the roll of tape too."

“Geez. I thought you burned that there roll of tape. I was looking for

it to tape up my Frank Shorter pin-up. but..."

close-range hoops in eleven at-
tempts and nine of eleven from the
line—good for 25 points. Forward
Russell Chapman and guard Bob
Huggins also broke into double
ﬁgures with 10 apiece, while the
Mountaineers shot 50 percent for
the game, due in large part to
numerous lay-ins and tip-ins.

“Once they got their running
game going, we were in trouble,”
lamented Grgurich.

_‘‘Kelvin Smith missed a couple
of lav-ins and this hurt us. We just
have to make those shots.”

Smith, replacing Mike Rice early
in the second half after the latter
had been assessed his fourth foul,
fumbled the ball away twice under
the Pitt basket on easy scoring
opportunities.

The Panthers once more were led
offensively by Larry Harris, with 25
points, while Rice added 13 before
departing via the foul route. Ed
Scheuermann added 10, nine
coming before intermission.

Rice collected 10 of his 13
markers in the ﬁrst half and the
frontcourt duo of Rice and
Scheuermann had a combined
second half total of four points and
four rebounds, an example of the
inconsistency which has plagued
the young Panthers all year. The
Cats followed a hot (62 percent)
shooting ﬁrst half with a miserable
closing period (30 percent) and
turned the ball over 24 times, as
opposed to 18 Mountaineer turn-
overs.

At times, especially in the second
half, the Pitt offense was downright
sloppy and completely incohesive as
WVU turned what had been a good
ball game into a laugher.

Grgurich, on his haunches
screaming throughout the game,
looked as drained as his players
afterward.

“We struggled,” he said, “The
last 15 minutes of the game we
really struggled.”

After WVU jumped off 14-8,
Grgurich switched from a straight
zone to man-to-man pressure to
bring the Cats back into things as a
Mike Rice baseline jumper gave Pitt
its ﬁrst lead, 30-28. But the
Panthers faded slightly in the
closing minutes of the half as Rice

Panther Lead Absorbed

BY, RON SIEGEL

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.—Had
it not Happened so often earlier, it
may have been time to throw in the
towel. Unfortunately for the Pitt
basketball team, its total collapse in

_the second half here Wednesday
‘-has occurred quite often, though

perhaps not so obviously.

With two minutes to go in the ﬁrst
half, Pitt led, 36-33, and was
playing a ﬁne basketball game
against an excellent West Virginia
squad. Before the second half
reached its midpoint, the Panthers
were down by 14 and playing with
all the smoothness of a ﬁsh
squirming around on a dock.

Exactly what caused this monu-
mental collapse is not readily
ascertainable. The official statistics
offer some insight, but they only
tell part of the story.

The record shows that Michael
Rice, Pitt's apparently irreplace-

- able center, picked up his fourth

personal foul with 17:38 left in the
game and Pitt trailing by ﬁve. Rice
left the game soon after that. _
The second half play-by-play, is

second half, Maurice Robinson
scored 14 of his 25 points and
teammate Tony Robertson added 16
of his 26 for the Mountaineers.

The highly successful
Virginia adjustment at the half was
for Robinson to work on Rice, either
scoring baskets, drawing fouls. or
both. The plan worked beautifully.
Robinson scored a slew of points,
and Rice got into foul trouble and
left the game.

While West Virginia was scoring
consistently, Pitt went into some
sort of panic, constantly coughing
up possession on stupid shots and
absurd attempted passes.

Pitt shot 62 percent in the ﬁrst
half, but the ﬁgure dropped to a
dismal 29.4 percent for the second.

The difference in the second half
was that Pitt got into a running
game with the Mountaineers.
Robertson took advantage of the
situation, stopping and popping
short-range jumpers with laughing
ease. ,

“We just cannot run with a team
like West Virginia,” said a peeved

' Tim Grgurich after the game. Grg-

urich had a long talk with his squad

and they emerged from it sad but

unwilling to quit".

(two with Duquesne, one with Penn
State), the Panthers will most likely
meet the Mountaineers in the ﬁrst
round of the playoffs. They feel
they can beat West Virginia though
failing twice already this season.

"I believe we could have beaten
anybody we played this year," said
Larry Harris, who led Pitt with 25
points. “You don't beat a nation-
ally-ranked team like Cincinnati and
not think you can beat West
Virginia.”

‘ ‘We could beat them if we played
like we did in the ﬁrst half for 40
minutes,” said guard Scott Ned-
row. “Their press got to us and we
lost our composure. They made us
move out of our offense.”

The Panthers have their work
more than out out for them. To
avoid meeting West Virginia in the
ﬁrst round of the playoffs (March 2),
the Panthers must defeat Penn
State at home on February 19 and
knock off Duquesne at least once.
They host’ the Dukes at the Field
House tomorrow night, then meet
them again at the Civic Arena on
February 27. They also need a West
Virginia victory over, Penn State.

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team made its own kind of history
Tuesday night when it traveled to
Slippery Rock College and edged

A the Lady Rockets for the ﬁrst time

ever, 129.15-126.50.

“It's the first time we have ever
beaten Slippery Rock,” Pitt coach
Donna DeMarino said happily.
“The teams were very evenly
matched ability-wise. Slippery
Rock has always been strong, one of

Grapplers’

   

the strongest teams in the East.”
Freshmen Alison Hoburg and
Regina Carson and junior Cyndee
Severyn led the Pantherettes to
their highest point total of the
season. Hoburg captured the
all-round title with a score of 32.65,
which included a tie for second in
vaulting and two third place ﬁnishes
in the uneven parallel bars and the
balance beam, respectively.
Severyn was the bigwinner for
Pitt, taking first place honors in
both the uneven parallel bars and

Hopes To

Catch Navy Fleeting?  

BY JIM LEWIS

Navy shmavy. They're more like
a Spanish Armada.

The Midshipmen wrestling team,
which faces Pitt tomorrow at 2 p.m.
in the Fitzgerald Field House,
doesn’t have a weak boat in the

' entire ﬂeet—and that spells trouble

for the English-speaking Panthers.

“They've got a nicely balanced
lineup all the way through,” Pitt
head coach Dave Adams admired.
“They don't have any weak spots.”

That’s true; Navy has already
tasted national ranking this season
and is 8-5 in the tough Eastern
Intercollegiate Wrestling Associa-
tion, thanks to the performance of
126-pounder Mike Beck (with a
personal 10-4-1 record), 142-poun-
der Tom Bauer (11-3-1), 158-
pounder John Althens (14-1-1) and
190-pounder Greg Cooper (ll-5).

Pitt, in the meantime, is 5-4
(having lost four in a row) in the
strong Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) and is struggling to keep its
head above the .500 water mark as
they prepare for the EWL.
Tournament, the first lock on the
way to the nationals.

“We're keeping afew guys out of
the lineup at different times to
prepare for the tournament,”
Adams explained. “Injuries are a

definite reason behind this.”

Injuries are so bad, Adams still
isn't sure who will start. But three
grapplers who will probably see
action are Skip Bolin (167-pounder
with a personal 10-0 campaign and
four pins), Bill Bailey (190-pounder
with a 10-2 record and four pins) and
heavyweight Mark Stepanovich (a
9-3 showing with one pin).

With these three, plus a little help
from the lightweights, Adams
hopes to break a losing skein longer
than a chain of barges.

“We like to think we’ll win,” he
stated. ' ‘You never expect to lose. I
hope we can get the match up to
where we can pull it through.”

And so, although the Panthers
have frequented Davy Jones’

Locker more times than they’ve-

cared to, they are optimistic. Which
is surprising after the month
they’ve spent—consecutive road
defeats at the hands of Millersville
(22-20), Lehigh (41-3), Clarion
(32-13) and Lock Haven (35-15).

“Whether or not we win will
depend on the student turnout,”
Adams claimed. “When you get
the home crowd behind you, it helps
in any sport. Especially if they're
vocal. This could be a real big
match for us.”

Big shmig. After four straight

the balance beam. Carson took the
ﬂoor exercises with the meet’s high
score of 8.9 and tied Severyn for
second place in the all-around.
DeMarino went into the meet
looking for a tight match and that is
exactly what the third-year coach
had waiting for her. ’ The
Pantherettes led by just under one
point after the ﬁrst event and
steadly increased their advantage
as the night wore on. What
DeMarino did not expect was the
way her team went about its win.
“Slippery Rock traditionally is
strong on the uneven bars and
vaulting and we are strong in ﬂoor
‘exercises and the. balance beam,”
the coach stated. “But'we beat

. them on both the bars and the beam _
(thanks to Severyn) which surprised‘

us. We did not have a fantastic
night on the beam, but we pulled it
out on the ﬂoor exercises.”

Other Pitt women contributing to
the win were Diane Miller who took
a second in the vaulting (the only
event the Lady Rockets captured),
Clare Henry on the uneven parallel
bars and Joyce Morley on the
balance beam.

If DeMarino and her club are
planning to rest on their laurels of
Tuesday night in their next meet,
they are in for a big surprise.

zTonight they face Clarion College,
the 1976 national champions and
according to DeMarino, this year’s
edition is better than last.
f‘Clarion has a much-improved
team over last year,” DeMarino
explained.

Titanic Mermaids Splash
By Slippery Rock, 72-57

BY JOHN FINN

Despite a sluggish start, the
Pantherette swimmers rallied to
defeat the upset-minded Slippery
Rock Rockettes, 72-57, Tuesday
night at Trees Pool.

Slippery Rock won the opening
relay, the 200-yard medley, and
took the lead. But Pitt bounced back
as Christy Elston captured the
200-yard freestyle relay with a time
of2:O1.8. ,

Then disaster struck. Pitt’s
Jennifer Price and Sue Dowd
false-started twice in the 100-yard
individual medley and were dis-
qualiﬁed, along with the top-seeded
swimmer from Slippery Rock. This
left only two lesser-known Rock-
ettes in the event. The two girls
glided to any easy ﬁrst and second
place ﬁnish and eight unanswered
points, giving Slippery Rock a big
early lead after taking an event that
Pitt was favored to win.

Next came the 50-yard back-
stroke. The best Pitt could do was a
third-place ﬁnish by Dianne Klug-
lien. At this point, it looked like
Slippery Rock was on the verge of a
major upset. ,

Realizing their precarious posi-
tion, the Pantherettes began to play
catch-up swimming with Sue Guyer
and Kathy Stetler leading the way.
Guyer notched a ﬁrst in the 50-yard
breaststroke with a time of 33.1
while Stetler captured the 50-yard
freestyle with a time of 25.1.

Nila DeJesus continued the pace
set by Guyer and Stetler by winning
the 50-yard butterﬂy.

But on this-particular night it was
the divers who bailed out the
Pantherettes and pulled the meet
out of the -ﬁre (or water, if you will).

Pitt’s divers placed ﬁrst, second

and third in both the one-meter andi-._.

three-meter competition. Jenny
Booker placed third from both
heights. Linda Hamner took second
in the one-meter diving and Connie
Heister was second in the three
meter diving.

The star for Pitt, however, was
Cindy Ferrero who ﬁnished ﬁrst in
both events and added 10 points to
Pitt’s team score.

In other events, DeJesus and,

Jamie Conley ﬁnished one-two’
respectively in the 100-yard butter-
ﬂy. DeJesus’ time was 1202.9 while
Conley turned in a time of 1:03.2.

Stetler captured her strongest

event, the 100-yard freestyle, with 

time of 54.9. Elston missed victory
by a fraction of ‘a second in the
100-yard backstroke. She ﬁnished
second after appearing to have gone
too deep on her ﬁnal’ turn.

After that,
overwhelmed the Rockettes by

sweeping the 500-yard freestyle and

the 100-yard breaststroke.

‘ It was Price touching out Sandy

iMoran in the 500-yard freestyle

with Judy Heretick ﬁnishing third.

In the 100-yard breaststroke, it was
DeJesus, Guyer and Conley finish-
ing first, second and third,

, respectively. A

With the meet hopelessly lost,

Slippery Rock won the ﬁnal relay t?‘v:~5/?*‘

add some degree of respectability to
the score.

After the Pitt Hockey Club
opened last weekend's Philadelphia
road trip with a ragged showing
against the Junior Flyers, they
learned how a long bus ride can
hamper a team's performance.

Thanks largely to a weary

’cross-state journey, Pitt surren-
dered’ two quick goals “and.

consequently failed to pick up the
slack‘ in bowing, 6-4.

The Panthers are packing their
bags again today in an attempt to
overcome another “bus-lag” chal-

lenge as they play Saturday and \

Sunday games in two different

p states.

The team bus is scheduled to
leave at midnight tonight enroute to
New Jersey where the Princeton
JV’s will host the twice beaten
Panthers in a 4 p.m. game
tomorrow.

Immediately following the
Princeton contest, the Panthers will
hit the turnpike for another grueling
six-hour trip and will arrive in
Annapolis, Md., at midnight. No
sooner will they have begun
dreaming of ﬂying pucks then they"
will start preparing for a 10:30 a.m.
game with the Naval Academy"
Sunday.

Princeton is coached by National
Hockey League hall-of-famer Bill
Quackenbush, who, as old-time
hockey buffs remember, won the

" Lady Byng trophy while playing for
Detroit during the 1948-49 season. -

The Panthers can't boast of an
NHL hall-of-famer but they have the
next best thing in sophomore Curt
Hetz. By virtue of his three—goal
performance in Philadelphia last
weekend, Hetz regained his status
as Pitt’s leading goal scorer with 18,
surpassing Tom Sherwin (16) who
didn't see much action because of a
sore shoulder. _

Leading scorer Bill Dooley will
lead the way for a Navy team that
owns a mediocre 5-5-2 record but
has more going for it than. a .500

won-lost average might suggest.  -I:
1 The-; Mi,<lS¥!iP!?1 '  

and if games played against
common opponents this year are
any indication, the rematch should
prove to be a nip and tuck battle.

Pitt and Navy" skated to 8-8 and‘
3-3 ties, respectively, against
powerful Penn ' State and both
squads disposed of an under-
manned New Church Academy
team, with the Panthers taking an
8-2 decision and Navy prevailing,
6-3.

2 Dukes in the Pittsburgh Classic, the

Panthers were one point losers.
‘ ‘I'm waiting on Duquesne, ” said

, Harris with a gleam in his eye.’ “I

really believe we should have beat
them at the beginning of the year,
and I didn’t play the last eight
minutes.-”

Pitt has shown improvement in its
last three games, but it all went by
the wayside in Wednesday’s second

half. Time is running out for the ‘

Panthers to develop the consistency
they'll need to make their presence
felt in the Eastern Collegiate
Basketball League Tournament.
