Going Upl

YESTERDAY, the United States Department
of Commerce opened hearings to learn a few
things about the latest air disaster that claimed
thirteen lives in the recent Clifton crash.

The investigators will attempt to establish the
position of the plane in its last moments of ﬂight.
to learn whether or not its motors seemed to be
functioning normally, and to picture what eye-
witnesses saw when the ship nosed downward to
the earth. Shortly, technical witnesses, includ-
ing airways control men at the airport, weather
bureau officials, radio and motor technicians, and
TWA officials will be called to take the stand.

From those testimonies, the Federal investiga-
tors will forward a digest of the ﬁndings to
Washington and there the Department of Com-
merce will release the official report.

At the present date, there are at least two theo-
ries to explain the cause of the disaster. One
group claims that ice, coating the wings of the
plane, weighed down the ship to the extent that
it stalled before the pilot could realize the ship
was losing speed to a dangerous degree. This
theory places the bulk of the responsibility on
the pilot. .

A contrasting theory maintains that a “local-
ized” icing condition which froze the ailerons,
an unprecedented occurrence in aviation history,
threw the ship out of control. TWA officials
back up this “act of God” theory by contending
that weather conditions last Thursday, the day
of the crash, were not hazardous to ﬂying in this
district, and that only this “localized” icing con-
dition could explain the tragedy. In this theory,
the responsibility belongs to our aeronautical
engineers, possibly through no fault of their own
if the condition never before was reported, for
not developing a device to cope effectively with
this supposed “localized” icing condition.

It is this second theory, or one similar to it,.

which we hope will prove correct. For if that
proves to be the cause of the loss of thirteen
lives, then the loss may well be worth the price
if proper equipment is installed on Transconti-

nentaliand Western Air skyliners to guarantee‘

no reoccurance of the recent disaster.
HOWEVER, every piece of evidence should

be carefully examined to check both of these —

theories, for perhaps neither will prove to be
a correct solution. Today, the lives seem to be
the most important concern, but tomorrow they,
like so many of the Boones of an earlier era, will
be mere marks on the wings of progress. Air
travel is moving ahead, and with each of its tre-
mendously over-publicized tragedies, new and
more important changes are being made. The
publicity and horror should make people more
determined, rather than discourage and frighten
them, that air travel will play an important part
in transportation of the future. As a matter of
fact, a person is many times safer traveling by
the air mile than stepping into an automobile to
get from place to place. And also consider that
public transportation by airplane is only a de-
velopment of the past few years. One more link
in the history of the air has been ﬁt into place.
Travel, unlike the American dollar, is going UP
to STAY. . .

 

Ho, Hum, zzzzzz...

LONG about this time of the year, seniors,
especially, pause to leaf through some of the
more stable of the University publications. They
learn many new and strange things. For in-
stance, they are happy to discover from the stu-
dent handbook, The Pitt Compass, quote, that
blue and gold are not compatible with booing or
any ungentlemanly conduct, unquote. That’s cer-
tainly drawing the color line. It further reads
that “it is traditional that at no time will Pitt
and Tech blaspheme each other.” This should be
taken up with most any Pitt, Tech lineman be-
fore being declared quite constitutional.
Then passing to more important things, there’s
a clause in the project section of the constitution
of Men's Council that gives to that hibernating
body the powers of “careful study of all prob-
lems pertaining to men.” The boys may have
some blond-trouble on their hands, one person
remarks, if that point is taken too literally. So
the book is closed, and spring fever takes hold
once more.

  Brain Straighteners

By Albert Lasday
Every one can remember having attended a dinner or
party where the men talked politics, the women discus-
sed operations, and things were generally disrupted.
When that happens, it usually takes a very good hos-t to
get things started again, unless. hereads this column.
The reason is that today’s “Brain Straightener” is a good
bet to arousing interest and discussion. An unusual va-
rietyof answers will be given for the following problem:
A wine glass is half-ﬁlled with wine, and another
glass, twice as large, "is ﬁlled to one-third of its capac-
ity,‘ also with wine. If both glasses are ﬁlled the restiof
“the way with water, und"tl1e contents ‘of each is
poured intoa single large tumbler, what will be the
proportion of wine and water in the resulting mix-
ture? ' ‘

Q . THE-_ P>lTT 
Sound And _§_ Jaiyes Words of the Wise!
. 1- ‘
V ' ’ Donoghue Compiled by John Martinco
Fury 5 9 ’ You Don't Sayl

IN A VERY delightful essay, Dr. Stephen Leacock, the

eminent Canadian humorist, once lamented the pass-
ing of the melodrama. It was, he d_eclare<_i, one of the
really thrilling things in his young l1fe,4fa1rl_y sparkling
of life and adventure and his soul.found vicarious _en-
joyment in the providential snatching of the beautiful
heroine from the snapping edges of the lumber saw; or
the saving of her sweet torso from the onrushing wheels
of the Flying 666.

Of Things Of Yore
ALTHOUGH, UNLIKE Dr. Leacock, I wansn’t brought

up on melodramas, for this cynical age _frowns on
the ‘too-obvious—accepting instead the (lU.b10l.1S virtue
of the escape movies——I do lament the fact that the
cowboy thriller has gone. I realize, of course, that the
“horse opera” is in vogue, and that of all the types of
movies, it pays the greatest proportional re_tu_rns to the
producers, but still the western, as I knew It in the day
of Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson is definitely a thing of
the past. The‘ present—day efforts that pass under the
name of “westerns” are pretty much a milk and water
sort of thing; they lack the red, raw bloody meat that
the others had. . _ '

Kids today don’t sit on the edge of their seats, as we
used to do, and warm with righteous happ1ne§S When
the hero——in our childish manner we termed hnn, “the
good guy”——scores a point against “the bad guy.” _ Nor
do kids today feel any real antipathy toward the Vlllalll
in the piece. We regularly used to give lnm what was
then ‘the equivalent of the Bronx cheer; we did every-
thing but hurl brickbats at the silver screen. Today’s
children accept the villain and the hero as complemen-
tary parts of the show; and the lovely heroine, whose
soft lashes used to make our hearts melt, is discussed
by them quite objectively.

Perhaps it’s the growth of realism. I don’t know, nor
pretend to. Kids today feel far more emotionally about
G-‘lien and the Public Enemies No. 1, 2, and 3._ I sup-
pose these rascals have, like Chimborazo Cotopaxi, “stole
their hearts away.” V

Since this is more or less a piece of reminiscense,
rather ‘than .a disquisition on changing morals, I sup-.
pose I might as well tell something about the trials and-
tribulations that used to beset us in watching our favor-
ite dramas. Often the reel would break in the most
exciting part of the ﬁlm. We’d wait patiently for a
minute, and then, if no picture were forthcoming, we’d
evince our displeasure by stomping or whistling or some
other form of noise-making. We were really in ea.rnest
about the noise making; it was not something we in-
dulged in to pass the time away. We did it because we
wanted the operator to hurry up and get the reel ﬁxed
so that the show would go_ on. . .

Blood And Cream Puffs ii . ,
P'.ART OF THE GREAT thrill of the movies in those
days was of course, the list ﬁght. Such pugilistic

 

giants as graced the silver screen in those days packed’

a wallop and they were willing to let it ﬂy——and their
opponents to receive it—in return for their -weekly sal-
arycheck. If those ﬁghts were ﬁlmed again with sound
apparatus, audiences would probably hear the sounds of
sturdy rights cracking ribs and what not. Ah, those
were the days! _ f

' Of course, I never did like the dog movies.‘ I never
could quite convince myself that Rin-Tin-Tin wasn’t just
an ordinary police dog with a full stomach. Nor was

Strongheart any better. In addition, I was considerably‘

disillusioned when I read in the papers once that. strong-

heart had_ just become the proud parent of a. litter of 5

pups. One, after all, doesn’t associate 'one’s heroes
with such mundane tasks of continuing the ‘race. Some-
how heroes, if they are to beheroes have got to’ be of
diﬂ"erent clay. ; -

-‘ Study in Comfort

(Editor's Note: This is the third in a. series of ar-
ticles dealing with the mechanics and composition of
the Cathedral Library.)

Before May of last year, the function of the main
desk in the library at Room 310, State Hall, was to take
charge of the lending, reference, and reserve book de-
partments of the ‘University library. The system at best
tended to be unwieldy.

Since last May, when the headquarters of the Univer-
sity’s some 500,000 volumes were transferred to the
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth floors of the Cathedral, the three
departments became specialized branches under the
general supervision of J. Howard Dice, University li-
brarian. In the course of this series, we shall discuss
the functions of these three departments of the library.
We have already treated the lending department.

The function of the reserve book room is, according
to Mrs. Helen H. Downs, lending librarian and librarian
in charge of that department, to permit professors at
the University to put volumes of special interest to their
students on reserve. Many of these books are assigned
as required or suggested reading in particular courses,
included in the college, schools of business administra-
tion and education, the evening and Saturday sessions,
and the graduate schools.

Since the volumes may be set on reserve for different
periods of time and then released to the lending depart-
ment, there is no deﬁnite number of volumes contained
in the fourth ﬂoor rooms. “The average number of vol-
umes in the reserve rooms is 3,000,” Mrs. Downs esti-
mated. .

The di_ﬁ‘ere11ce between the reserve and reference
rooms is that the former contains volumes kept out of
general circulation temporarily, while the latter’s vol-
umes are kept on the shelves permanently, Mrs. Downs
pointed out. Provided that there are extra copies of a
particular volume, books in the reserve roo-m may be bor-
rowed overnight by students and faculty members, pro-
vided that they are returned at 8:30 o’clock the follow-
ing morning.

One of the most frequently used departments of the
library, the reserve book room is open from 8 o’clock
in the morning to 10 o’clock a't night. One regulation has
been set: the reserve book room is for quiet study.

Under the lending library, the department is super-
vised directly by Miss Sara Howard, library assistant
in charge of the reserve book room, who is aided by
Charles Kirkbride.

Elevator Reunio

By Upandown

It is genial Andy Sable, elevator operator, whose “as—
cending from” or “descending to, the main foyer” strikes
your fancy. Andy Sable is somewhat of a sophisticated
elevator operator, and, as he says, “I have my"fun. The;
other morning, for instance, I learnedthat I had served
as University romance-interlocutor.” _ ,

According to Sable, it began with a pert freshman" coed,
one Jane Grace Whitling, C40, of Aspinwall, Pa. .Miss
Whitling, it seems, was ascending in one of the Sable-
propelled machines. when, as the elevator door slid open,
she noticed a middle-aged carpenter with equally middle-
aged carpenter to'_ols. Sable ‘tells us that.-it happened like

“First she asked me what the fellow’s name was. She
was cute--so I told her. Then she explained that she knew
a fellow in her home town that was a -c_a1'penter,
was in Pittsburgli, and may have been working at the
Cathedral. She commissioned me to ﬁnd out if he was
working in the building. -1," accepted the commission.

“The general repulsion to the
use of aboriginal words was no

Chemistry Departments,

By Bob Leon

There is a small, frame building
wedged behind Thaw Hall, that very
few people know much about. Painted
a well-worn gray, it identiﬁes itself
only by the legend on the frosted-
glass door: “X-Ray Lab, Victor
Hicks”. This building houses the Uni-
=rersity’s Cooperative X-Ray labora.-
tory. _ .

The laboratory, which is under the
jurisdiction of Dr. Victor Hicks, is
called “co-operative” because it is
‘ponsored jointly by the Physics de-
partment, the Chemistry department,
and Mellon Institute.“ It is used by
various industrial ﬁrms as well. .3
On the subject of x-rays Dr. Hicks
says: “In recent years x-rays have
been used with greater frequency for
diagnosing industrial troubles. By
using the x-ray as the physician does
industrialists are enabled to ﬁnd im-
perfect castings, improper assembly,
etc., before "damage is done.

Oh Yes, the Girl Friend! ;
“X-Rays are used as a research
tool. Because of their shortness they
are defracted bythe atoms on which
they strike, giving rise to what is
known as a diffraction pattern. This
pattern differs in arrangement for
every diﬁ“erent compound.”

As an example of a diffraction pat-
tern, Dr.‘Hicks said, “The. next time
you are walking ‘the girl-friend home
on a rainy night, take a ‘look_at the
street lights’ through her umbrella.
What you see is a diﬂ’1'action pat-
tern.” ' '   

_At the present time there are 40
students enrolled in the“ x-ray.‘ course.
A number of these are from oil’ the
campus, and nearly half -of them do
laboratory work in the afternoon

and evening. The course includes: the
making of shadow pictures with
x-rays, identiﬁcation of compounds
by diffraction patterns, and the ar-
rangement of atoms in crystals. Since
the Laboratory has been in existence,
ﬁve students have done work towards
their Ph.D. degrees in it. To date,
eight scientiﬁc papers have been
written on work done in the labora-
tory; two more are scheduled for re-
lease this spring. ,_

Work in the x-ray laboratory can
be exceedingly dangerous. The touch-
ing of a. high-voltage connection
could. result in electrocution. Expos-
ure for too long a time to the power-
ful rays can cause horrible burns.
There has never been an accident in
the laborator_v, but this is due, only.
to the extraordinary precautions that
are taken.

comprise the ball - toting list. Urban

halfback last fall, tops the list of new
