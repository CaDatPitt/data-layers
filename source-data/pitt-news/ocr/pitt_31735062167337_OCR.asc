 

ROBERT KENNEDY, 1960

From Third Born

ents.

To Candidacy Race,
He Had To Compete

By PEGGY ALLEN and
BARBARA MARKOWITZ

Senator Robert Kennedy al-
ways had to compete. When he
was born in 1925, his brother
John was 8 and Joseph Jr. was
10.

He was the smallest and
thinnest in a family where ev-
en_the girls were athletic.

“Never take second best,”
his father constantly urged him.
“When the going gets tough,
the tough get going; passivity
is intolerable.

Robert was a sophomore at Har-
vard when his oldest brother,
Jospeh Jr., was killed in a Navy
plane over the English Channel.
Robert left school and joined the
Navy. He spent the rest of the
war in the Caribbean and return-
ed to Harvard in 1946. After gra-
dation, he went to law shcool at
the University of Virginia.

In 1951, he joined the criminal
division of the Department of Jus-
tice. When his brother John ran
for Senate in 1952; _Robert resign-
ed and became campaign manag-
er. The close attention paid to
details and the great amount of
money spent on this election were
to characterize Robert’s later
campaigns.

A Robert Kennedy became a con-
troversial figure when he was as-

signed to the Senate Permanent —
Subcommittee on Investigations‘

in 1953. Senator Joseph R. Mc-
Carthy headed this committee.
Because of a disagreement, Rob-
ert resigned but later rejoined
when Senator John L. McClellan
replaced Senator McCarthy.

McClellan was impressed with
Robert’s ability as an investiga-
tor and appointed him chief
counsel of the Senate Select
Committee on Improper Activi-
ties in the Labor or Management
Field. While on this committee.
Kennedy began investigating the
affairs of the Teamsters Union.

He left the committee in 1959
to manage his brother’s presiden-
tial campaign. In addition to his
work as campaign manager. he
acted as policy advisor. After his
brother defeated Nixon. Robert

FRECKES AND FRIEND

was appointed attorney general.

As attorney general, he invol-
ved himself in the areas of civil
rights, immigration, crime, labor
legislation, defense of the poor,
econimic monopoly, juvenile de-
linquency, and the Federal Judic-
iary.

He investigated the Central In-
telligence Agency after the Bay
of Pigs incident in 1961. In 1962,
he opposed air strikesvon Cuba
during the missle crisis.

In 1964 he opposed incumbent
Republican Senator Kenneth Keat-
ing of New York for his seat in
Congress. He defeated Keating
by 800,000 votes. He drew re-
sponse from young people and
demonstrated his phenomenal ap-
peal to crowds.

Kennedy took an active role as
a freshman senator. In his first
year he offered amendments to
bills dealing with federal investi-
gation of schools receiving Fed-
eral aid, extension of Appala-
chain poverty aid to 13 New York
counties, aiding Puerto Rican
New York residents to vote, and
long range planning for federal
aid.

He also organized a staff of ad- 1

ministrative assistants and con-
sultants who supplied him with
background for his speeches.

When asked if he was prepar-
ing to run for the presidency in
1968, he replied, “I don’t have
any long - range strategy.” He
did, however, announce that he
would run for re-election in the
Senate in 1970.

   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   

  

Three times in the last five years, American leaders
who provided a vital nexus between the American politi-
cal and social establishment, and who were best able to
reach the young and the disaffected have been brutally
cut down in their creative years. One mourns not only

for men and their families, but for the nation that pro-
duced such violence and which now has lost their tal-

Senator Robert F. Kennedy was remarkable as a
leader of men, a champion of social justice, and a stim-
ulant to progress. We must not, in our grief, despair of
what he hoped to achieve —— to redress the grievances
that divide our nation and to reunite our people under i
the rule of morality and law.

SG Passes Allocations

Seventeen Student Govern-
ment‘ (SG) Senators met with
the SG Allocations Committee
for eight and a half hours Sat-
urday in the Student’ Union
Supper Room, and when the
smoke cleared, 43 of 44 stu-
dent organizations had receiv-
ed, their recommended alloca-
tion. 7

The only proposed allocation
turned back to the Committee by
the senate was that of the Hill

Education Project (HEP). The dif—-

ference of thinking between the
senate and the Committee was a
total of $300.

After briefly discussing proce-
dures when the meeting conven-
ed at 9:30 a.m., the senate voted
to discuss the recommendations in
alphabetical order, starting with
the twenty—third name on the list,
Men’s Glee Club, and working to

44, then going back to number one_

and working to 22. The reasoh for
these procedures was that many of
the larger requests came from or-
ganizations listed later in the al-
phabet, and the senators wanted
to be fresh when discussing
these.

Overall, the Committee view-
ed requests totalling $221,132. The

Tuden Cites Violence

In Modern

Special to the Pitt News
No one can ignore the question
of violence in our society. It
seems that on a national level we
condone violence while on an in-
dividual level we condemn it. Dr.
Arthur Tuden explained that we

are attempting to solve our por-

blems in Vietnam with force; and
as a result, there must be reper-
cussions in our own society. We
have seen this through an increase
in crime.

Even if we put Vietnam aside,
there are more than enought pro-
blems at home that work as an
impetus for our growing rate of
violence. According to Dr. Tuden.
“we are not solving our basic pro-
blems. Although most Americans
recognized a need for change,
there has been no effective move-
ment to bring them about. The
Black ghetto has not disappear-
ed, inferior school systems have
not disappeared, nor has prejudice
disappeared.” he said.

It has been argued that getting
out of Vietnam is a solution to our
problem: this would stop the feed
back of violence into our society
and allow us to direct our re-
sources into our internal pro-
blems. “This is a lot of garbage,”
said Dr. Tuden. “No doubt, we
would find other places to spend
our money, other than on our so-
cial problems. ?’

recommended allocations totalled
121,000, and the amount actually
allocated totalled’ $119,213.

Allocations ranged from $28,403
the largest-for Student Govern-
ment to $135 the smallest-for the

International Folk Dance Group. J

The HEP request, because it.

was turned back, will now be held
until the fall for further investi-
gation. For various reasons, allo-
cations requests from the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Govern-
ment and the Pitt Theater will
also be held over until the fall.

One special case was made
through cooperation between the

senate and the Committee, WP‘

GH was granted $8000, but the
Committee agreed to review a re-
quest for additional funds in the
fall. WPGH’s original request
was for $29,570 and the senators
present felt that the recommenda-
tion represented too severe a cut
by the Committee. However, the
recommendation was approved in
order that WPGH be able to oper-
ate this summer.

Those allocations approved will -

be placed into the accounts of the
various activities for use as of
July 1.

i A Eulogy

He was a man—~a man of compassion and feeling. He
was a man among men for he stood tall and straight never

a bending under the great pressures of criticism and hatred.

He never wilted for he was man ahead of his time.

Robert Francis Kennedy was a man, a father, and a
statesman who saw the vital need for change in this our
“Great Society”. Never once did he neglect the burdens and
miseries of the poor and underpriveldged. Aside from just
feeling compassion for the Mexican American, the Spanish

American,-"and the Afro-American, he sought remedies for

their complex problems. Robert Kennedy was not onlooker,
he was a man of action.

 it It is quite difficult to assess what greatness is in a man.
Isevery President of the United States a great man? Can
greatness be analyzed in terms of financial success?

These questions have no answers. Greatness is a subject-
ive quality that few men ever reveal. But Robert Kennedy had
that greatness—a quality that inspired people throughout this
nation. And there are far too few men in this country who have
this rare quality.

The last quest of Robert Kennedy was his greatest. In
the turmoil of the presidential campaign, Robert Kennedy
stressed those policies that would ultimately seal the open
wounds of the “Great Society.” He called for a new politics
whereby the individual would be given more representation,
"He believed that our representative democracy was not re-
presentative enough. And he took his campaign to the people.
And the people voted for this man who was ahead of his time.

No other statesman saw the internal and external prob-
lems confronting this society as well as Robert Kennedy. And
he was scoffed for his minority stands. He was hated by those
who cowered in the protective confines of the status-quo.
But he was above that criticism and hatred. He stood un-
moved by that criticism, and he continued to cry out for
societal change.

But like all great men, Robert Kennedy’s bright message
of the future was dimmed by the realities of the present. But
he fought on never compromising his principles or beliefs,
for he knew the right road to follow. And that road was
the uphill street to reconciliation and peace.

Robert Kennedy was a rare human being for he did not
exist merely for himself and his immediate family. He was
a humanitarian—a man for all men. '

He died for mankind, but he shall live eternally. God

bless you Robert Francis Kennedy.

Harcvey Raps Politics

During the summer of 1964, I
heard Paul Harvey address a -roup
of students and youth leaders. At
the time, Harvey was a controver-
sial newscaster for ABC radio,
and few of those who heard him
open a news broadcast with “Good
evening, Americans” will ever for-
get his voice. Possibly it was his
voice that caused me to remem-
ber what he said. Possibly it was
the validity of his speech that
never allowed me to forget.

Harvey opened his talk with an
attack on the presidential timber
that the Republican party was of-
fering for the upcoming ’64 elec-
tion. He noted inexperience, lack
of leadership and the unimpres-
sive overall qualifications of the
candidates (which he felt were
too few in number) that the Re-
publicans were sending to the con-
vention that year.

The attack was greeted with
cheers, clapping and sparse laugh-
ter by the audience, most of whom
still identified with the youthful
image of the Kennedy-led Dem-
ocrats of the early sixties. But,
Harvey went on to shock the
cheering audience. As he contin-
ued his speech, an air of aware-

A Time Of Peace

By DAVID TIERMAN

ness hovered over the youths.

Lyndon Johnson and his con-
tempories were the next to be an-
alyzed by Harvey, and they met
with the same criticism that the
Republicans had received. The
fact that Johnson would receive
the nomination without a decent
challenge from the other “hope-
fuls” seemed to be Harvey’s main
complaint.

According to Harvey, the ’64
election would be a choice be-
tween “the lessor of the two
evils.” He felt that the candida-
tes of both parties were not of the
caliber that should represent the
United States as president. May-
be Paul Harvey should replace
Jeane Dixon, for not only was the
election of 1964 a choice between
two “so—so” candidates, but this
year’s is beginning to look like the
instant replay. If Harvey could
find unlimited fault with the ’64
nominees, think what he would
say about the candidates this year.

Why, in a country founded on
democratic grounds that allow it
to be only as strong as its govern-
ment, are there so few candidates
—with such mediocre records and
drab personalities? Where are the

leaders? Where are the success-
ful politicians? “Making their for-
tunes elsewhere”, was Harvey‘s
answer.

In the conclusion of his speech,
Harvey appealed to the youth of
America to continue through life
with the same ideals that they
held as teenagers. He said that
far too many political hopefuls are
defeated on a local level by a
powerful, and often crooked, pol-
itical machine. Since these aspir-
ants are defeated before they
really start, they go into a dif-
ferent profession and are often
quite successful. Seldom, accor-
ding to Harvey, do these men re-
turn to the political jungle, for
they have lost the zeal and faith
they had as youths.

It made me feel terribly im-
portant to have Paul Harvey ap-
peal to me, and my cohorts, to
workhard in an attempt to add
good timber to the political races.
I never forgot Harvey’s speech in
the past four years. I doubt if I
will forget it in the next four
years. I hope I will never for-
get it. Paul Harvey, goodnight.

Doubts Plague Us Forever

By JUDITH GALARDI
a time of peace (Eccles-
iastes 3:8).

I am only eighteen years old,
and within the past five years of
my life I have witnessed the vio-
lent deaths of three great men
who practived ahp preached non-
violence. They spoke of the res-
pect and dignity of human life.
They referred to only one race
when they spole——the human race
AbsNact words often filled with
messages: peace, equality, love,
joy, hope and many othersj The
lives they lived were lived to the
fullest, because each man had a
cause for which he lived. Love
was their principle cause. They
wanted to make this the cause of
all men.

We, the members of this gener-
ation, must seek peace. Not a
peace between nations, but a peace
that is within ourselves. Internal
peace must be found before ex-
ternal peace is reached. We
mustn’t be too anxious or eager
to cure the ills of this present'so-
ciety until we can cure the ills
that are within ourselvesj We
must be tolerant Hf other-'5 ll§F«'§ll§§
we, too, deserve tolerance.

Each of us must search our-
selves and find the peace that is
within us. This isn’t an easy task.
It will include the answering of
the questions: “Who am 1'? Why
am I ? What do I want to do
with my life? How can’I do it?
The tearing down of prejudices
will also be necessary. We must
also take a good look at ourselves

How Our Readers

UA Chairman Speaks out on Article

Editor, The Pitt News:

Regarding your article “GSPIA
Students Ask System Change” in
the June 4 issue: Let me first
compliment you for having in-
cluded the article, but at the same
time I regret that the article was
so short. Much of the story about
discussions and changes in the
Urban Affairs Department did not
appear in the article.

In particular, I feel certain that
few students in the UA Depart-
ment feel they are treated “as
sheep” by most Urban Affairs fac-
ulty members. Rather, I suspect,
students who come to the school,
particularly those fresh from un-
dergraduate school, tend to be
timid in their approach to the
school and the study of Urban
Affairs—as sheep, if you will.

Recognizing this legacy of pro-
gramming in the undergraduate
schools, most students feel that it
is the responsibility of the school
and the faculty to transform these
sheep-like individuals into more
creative, independent, and certain-
ly more highly motivated beings,
especially if these same students
are to be expected to have any
useful effect as professionals in
American cities.

Thus this process of transform-

_ ing sheep into tigers requires a

rather different kind of profes-
sional school, one that is explicit-
ly flexible and innovative. This
school could become such a
school provided that the students,
professors and the University at
large were committed, enthusias-
tically, to this end. It is precise-
ly this concern that has stimulat-
ed the students and faculty con-
cern and action in the UA De-
partment.

Indeed, a substantial number
of professors here and in other de-
partments would seek to join with
students in working towards
“minimizing the potential” of
the school by restructuring cour-
ses and the way students and pro-
fessors interact and minimizing
other procedural handicaps such
as letter grades, certain course re-
quirements, and some limitations
on the way classes might be de-
veloped and conducted.

A lively dialogue has been tak-
ing place between a number
of students and the UA faculty
members since early April. In
fact Dr. Joseph McLean, the act-
ing Director of the Dept. of UA
has conducted three joint student-
faculty meetings to discuss the
school’s curriculum. Many other
informal student-faculty meeting

in the light that we think other
people see us. This will take a
greater deal of courage. I think
the members of our generation
have this courage.

When we finally find this inner
peace, we will then be able to
live in peace with each other.
Then peace will no longer be a
word found on the lips of dying
men“, l3i“1‘t"i‘t‘ wi1l”b‘ecoih‘e a*realit§
——a part of our culture.

Peace is love. Love is joy. Joy
is trust. Trust is love. Love is
peace. This is the beautiful cir-
cle we must put in place of the
vicious circle in which we have
become immeshed. In the vicious
circle, you can only look to the
past. In the beautiful circle, you
can also look to the future.

See It . 

man student — faculty meeting is
scheduled for Tuesday, June 11,
1968 to begin the task of imple-
menting some of the recommen-
dations that have come from these
meetings.

-It now seems that there will be
a significant amount of change
in the UA curriculum in the near
future — all as a result of this
dialogue process. While it is clear
that the students initiated the pro-
cess, much credit should go to the
Urban Affairs faculty for respond-
ing sdnsitively to the students.

Richey, Salter Point for NCAA’s in California

Jerry Richey and Bryan
Salter are fast approaching
the biggest challenge yet in
their brief varsity careers.
Both will be competing in the
NCAA championships this week-
end in California, The following
weekend are the AAU champion-
ships, and at least Richey will re-
main on the West Coast for them.
Head track coach Jim Banner
plans to enter Salter in the tripple
jump. In the recent IC4A’s, Salter
finished second in the event with
a jump over 49 feet. Banner is
hopeful that without the added
pressure of high jumping this
weekend, Salter will be able to
improve what was his best per-
formance.

Richey, on the other hand, will
not be running the mile in the
NCAA’s as he did in the IC4A’s
when he cracked the four-minute
barrier. Instead, he will run in
the 5,000 or more probably the
10,000 meter race. In the latter
two, Richey stands a better
chance of finishing in the top six,
thereby qualifying for the Olym-
pic Trials. If successful in the

Richey will enter the 1500 meters

(metric mile) in the AAU’s.

For the left - handed hurler
Davel Welty, the long wait is al-
most half -way over. Sometime
next week the ace of the Panther
staff will find out whether or»not
he has been drafted by a major
league team. .

According to the baseball rules
for drafting college athletes, only
first round picks can be made
public immediately. All other
picks remain unpublicized, even
to the players involved, for 15
days.

Welty, who has no idea which
club will pick him, is optimistic
despite failing to be drafted in the
first round. I

The Panthers opposed only one
of the top twenty draftees this
season. He was Kent State left-
fielder, Thurmund Munson, a

In Munson’s first two trips to
the plate against hurler George
Medich, he powered a double and
tripple to deep centerfield. But in
his third at bat, Munson was re-
tired by Welty.

An assistant professor of jour-
nalism at Penn State recently hop-
ped on the change - the - rules —
for - baseball bandwagon. Al-
though his plan is not quite as
farfetched as “three set baseball,”
which recently appeared in a nat-
ional sports magazine, Dr. Ivan
L. Preston will probably meet
with just as much opposition to
change.

Dr. Preston’s concern was the
“double penalty” now assesed
when a player is tagged out. That
is, the player must leave the base
paths and his team is charged with
an out.

The plan, devised to get more
action and scoring into baseball,
is to give the manager of the team
at hat a choice when a runner is
tagged out. He can remove the
runner from the base paths with
no out being charged, or, he can
take the out and return the runner
to the last base touched safely.
Dr. Preston sees this solution as
charging the offensive team with
only one penalty.

In other words, if a player is
thrown out trying to steal second

Dr. Preston feels that his plan

many tag plays in a game. “But
it would loosen up play by en-
