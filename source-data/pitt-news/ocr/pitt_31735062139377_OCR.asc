pressed a desire to ele'=vat«e the con- '

said, it almost grated on his nerves .

when he read of the ﬁghts going on
among the students of the High
schools and then was compelled to

believe that the same thing might oc— '

more free from unsportsmanlike con-

Candidly, we believed the time was

at hand when the University shoulrli

becin line with the other colleges of
the country and have a weekly paper,
not for the simple reason of having '1
paper, but because the growing _con-
dition of the University made such

‘a weekly and those honorable rivals
of ours down in V_\_/ashington, Pa,
have a paper of which they may well

HITTNER COMES HERE.

Billy Hittner, the well known ath-
lete, who has been deliberating upon

.a college for the coming year’ has

shown his‘ good taste and will be

among the sons of Pittsburgh this

coming term. The addition of Hitt-

ner to the football squad means much .

for the prospects.on.the gridiron this

of the Tech team for this year and
was a veritable sensation onithe ﬁeld
last year. C.oa'ch Thompson has al-

ready taken Hittner under his train-

ing and' we may expect an even better

record than last season from the

elusive Billy.

have already scheduled a few _games.

its entrance requirements materially,

FACULTY VA‘CAiTIO NS.

Professor I. F. Richardson reports
a pleasant. ten days spent at Lake
George in the company of Professors
Bankson, White and . Harry.  He
claims to be free from any summer
girl entanglements, in spite of :‘all in-
fluences of environment and com-

panionship. He afterwards _spent

‘about four weeks at his home, re-

turning then to the University to

«aidin the equipment of thelaboratory

and in getting things going in gen-
eral. ' ‘
Professor Harris frankly confesses
that he taught -'summer school ,, all"

isvalso likely that he wanted to keep 
‘in training and to avoid"spraininfg;~’

his intellect by a too sudden applicaiﬁ‘

fall term. He managed, however, in

the face of his new Professorship re-_,

sponsibilities and his commendable

nwork onfthe schedule, and on the co-

operative course in general, to spend
several days at his home in the north-

Soplisi Win Fight

The big day is

 

over the Sophs

and the Fresh have clashed in their

annual battle. For this year 1913
triumphed over 1914 by a score of
two to one, the former winning the
tug of war and “wrestling match‘ while
the latter won the rope rush. The

contest took place Friday afternoon‘

in front of Thaw Hall before a large
assemblage of students and friends
of -the University.
tor’s standpoint the rush this year
surpassed any of the affairs of the
pastiin that everything was [strictly
free from-any objectionable features.

- ful conduct of the underclassmen ﬁeld

speaker and he was given an atten-

tive hearing by the students present. -

The lower class contests detracted
somewhat from the number, which
would have been present, but the au-
dience was‘ fairly good sized, num-
bering most all the upper ‘classmen.
