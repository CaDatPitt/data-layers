 *1 *_Retnrn of Orders

By EMILY KAISERMAN

Students who have found them-
selves without texts thistrimester
will soon-be able to purchase their
required‘ books, according to Paul
Boltacz, manager of the Book Cen-
ter. ‘ .

It ‘akes approximately ten days

.‘to.Af'1.l1 the orders, but Boltacz

claims, “We are dependent on the
promptness of the publishersff
In answer to. complaints about

Professor of Nuclear Physics
Midday Series will present Dr. Norman Feather, profes-

sor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University. and au-
thority on nuclearxphysies, on Wednesday. noon in the SU-

what happened in -1960-.”

“There are two reasons for the
shortage,” he‘ continued. “The
primary one is the muchlarger.
than anticipated enrollment. The

predicted enrollment of -2.500, .

actuallyamounted to 5,000. It's
hard to try to estimate ﬁgures
withvno previous experience ‘in.
the .matter.”. , , - .

“The bookstore is guided by
what -the" departments themselves

estimate the enrollment will be."
~If they “would have "judged too

tmany, an overstocked store would
have resulted. In other words, the
same‘ thing that caused extra-'
classes leading to additional sec-
tions, has caused book shortage.”

The second reason» Mr.’ Boltacz
gave for the shortageof: books
was. the ‘impact of. self-service.
Many people are buying books for

‘-.5-courses they are not even regis-

tered in, just out of the interest
.created by seeing them on -the
open stock shelves.

In’surance Policy
Gets Dlsapproval

Donald Van Houten of the Dean
of Men's Office has announced
that the American United Life In-
surance Company has been solic-
iting among Pitt students with a
plan not endorsed by the Univers-
ity.

Although the university has not

 

been consulted on this matter, the"

-brochure states that “this plan is
for t students ‘of the University of
Pittsburgh.” Van Houten said
“Agents soliciting for this coin-
pany- are violatinga university
regulation, the purpose of which is
to. protect students, against such
practices."

Born in "1904, Feather attended Bridlington ‘School and
Trinity‘College,, Cambridge, from which he graduated with

a BA.‘ degree. He was awarded?

the B,.S.’ degree in 1926 and the
Ph.D. in 1930 from the University
"of London. From 1929 .to 1933 he.
was a Fellow of Trinity College.

' Feather has served as an Asso-
ciate in Physics at the Johns Hop-
kins University and was a Univer-
sity Demonstrator in Physics. at
Cambridge. At the University "of
Liverpoolhe was a Leverlulme
Fellow and Lecturer. He later
held the position of Lecturer in
Physics at Cambridge on radio-
activity and nuclear systematics.

A former member of the tech-
nical sub-committee of Project
Maud, the early British atomic
energy project,-Feather has also
served on the Advisory Board of
the Physics Society. _At present he
is a Fellow both of the Royal
Society and the Royal Society of
Edinburgh.

“An Introduction to Nuclear
Physics” and “Nuclear Stability

which include numerous papers
on ' radioactivity and nuclear

-physics in scientiﬁc journals-

Feather co-edits the “Cambridge

Monographs qn Physics.”

He will be on the campus un-
der the auspices of the American
Association of Physics Teachers,

one of. the ﬁve member societies
of the Institute of Physics. ,

’ The program of Visiting Foreign
Scientists in Physics, part of a
broad, nationwide program. ‘to
stimulate interest in physics, is
beingconducted with the support
of the National Science Founda-
tion. '

~ Now in its third year, it had

previously enabled prominent

American physicists to lecture

at many American colleges and

universities. Now it has been

'extended to include -visits by

distinguished physicists from

other countries to large univer-
sities.

Professor David Halliday,
chairman of the department of
psysics,. is in ’ charge of the ar-
rangements ,, for Feathcr’s visit.
The scientist will be at Pitt from
May 2 through May 6, giving.
formal lectures and taking part
in colloquia. '

‘ ‘He will also talk informally
with the physics staff and students
about teaching and research in
his country.,Feather’s plans might
includevisitations to nearby col-
leges or secopdary‘ schools to
learn about varied conditions un-
der which. physics is taught in the
United States.

Trend Toward Increase Observed C

“There is an observed trend to-
ward increasing enrollment for
the ‘fall trimester,” stated Jack P.
Critchﬁeld, assistant Dean of Ad-
missions.

Out oi‘ the 1875 applicants who
completed applications as of April
22, 1465 were for the school of
Liberal Arts and 410 for the
school of Engineering. About 1580
of these were -already admitted.

Critchﬁeld attributes this in-
crease to the trimester program,

IA and he went on to say, “Because

of the increasing number of ap-
plicants, the admissions office is
able to be more selective."

school classes than ever before.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores have also been higher on
the average.” -' ' .

The high standards of the ap-
plicants have caused many re-
quests for student aid in the form
of scholarships, grants, and loans.
Approximately 50 per cent have
sought such aid.

There. is an increase in the
money available for scholarships,
too, and so a greater number will
be available. The awards to;in—
coming freshmen will be released

  

,, ties. Of the 1580 who were ad-
mitted, 765 desire housing. Last
September, students enrolled
from 16 states and 44 counties.

Reservation deposits" of those
accepting admission are rapidly
pouring into the admissions office.

The deadline for enrollment is

May 2, but there will be an ex-

tension. -

Fielder to Direct

Signiﬁcant growth in the num-
ber of students ‘assisted by schol-
arships, grants-in-aids, and loans
has resulted in the establishment
of an Office of Student Aid.

Dr. Geise, assistant chancellor
for student affairs, has announced
the appointment of Earl Fielder as
Director of Student Aid in charge
of this“of‘fice.

Previously, the administration
of this program of ﬁnancial as-
sistance to students has been a
function of the Office of Admis-
sions, which was carried out by
Fielder, associate director of ad-
missions. _

However, during the past three
years, the number of students
assisted has increased by" 31 per
cent, and the total student aid
budget has been expanded by 43.6
per cent.

The growth of loan programs
hasbeen the ‘most signiﬁcant.
For example, during the 1957-58
' school year,‘ 85 students bor-
rowed $43,900,. whereas in 1959-
_ 0, 625" borrowed $313,000.~

Authors Tal at Writer’s Conference

' Noted Professors
Advise Aspirants

On Fundamentals
By SHEILA MALLINGER

' R o b e r t Brown advised
youngiauthors to keep writ-
ing, but to write honestly, at
the Annual Writer’s Confer-
ence held in Stephen Foster
Memorial last week.

He commented, “Write honestly,
andsooner or later it will find its
way.” ,

Mr. Brown, a 1939 graduate of
the School of Liberal Arts at the
University, took courses‘ from Dr.
Peterson, and praised the quality
of instruction which he received
in composition here veryihighly.

‘Brother, Which Drummer?’

He said that he felt this train-
ing was greatly responsible for
the potential success of his first
novel, “Brother, Which Drum-
mer'!”, which is to be published
May 11. .

Others participating in the
day-long conference included:
Montgomery Culver, A r th u r

‘Wilmurt, Loren Eisely, and
Margaret Coit.
Montogmery Culv'er, _assistant

professor of English, was gradu-
ated from the University in 1949
as a writing major and received
his Ph.D.'in English from. the
University of Illinois. Dr. Culver
took part in the panel discussion
during the morning session.
Writes Plays

Arthur Wilmurt, a teacher of
playwriting at Carnegie Tech,
previously taught at Yale. He is
the author of two Broadway plays,
"The Guest Room” and “Young
Couple Wanted.” ,

Margaret Coit, a ‘biographer,
was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in
1950 for her biography, “John
C. Calhoun.” She also wrote the
story of Bernard Baruch’s life,
entitled, “Mr. Baruch.”

In hervtopic, “The Quick and
the Deed,” Miss Coit attempted to
point out the dii‘l"ei'cnce and sim-
ilarities of writing the biography
of someone who is dead and un-
able to answer back, and the bio-
graphy of a living man.

Anthropology Head

Loren Eisely, an eminent an-‘
thropologist, ‘taught at the Uni-
versity of Kansas, Columbia, and
Harvard before accepting the
chairmanship of the department of
anthropology at the University of
Pennsylvania.

In his address, “Modern Sci-
ence and the Writer,” Eiscly
commented on the conformity
and uniformity of the present
age. '

Speaking from personal experi-
ence, he sta_ted,~“A man may be
both a scientist and an artist. If a
man is an artist he is a far better
scientist or at least a better hu-
man being.”

Dr. Eisely, a student of evolu—:

tion, is the author of “Immense

Dr. Kennard has authored many
publications on general ethnology,
linguistics,,_.and folklore. The book
“Culture and Mental Health,”
published by Macmillan last year,
included a chapter by Dr. Ken-
nard. The chapter dealt with the
relation of cultural patterns to
mental illness.

He has held fellowships from
the American Council of Learned
Societies, Columbia University
Social Science Research Coun-
oil, and the Laboratory of An-
thropology at Sante Fe, New
Mexico.

Dr. Peake said, “Dr. Kennard’s

Commenting on the conference,
which was under his charge, Dr.
Peterson said, “I think the panel

dies Assn. In the past the IRC
has held a “security council” on
campus. at which the roles of the
delegates from various nations
were played by members of the
club.

United Nations’ rules were fol-
lowed, and even the appropriate
languages of the countries were

_  The overcrowded classrooms and the lack ofptextbooks
‘ this trimester are the fault of those students who failed to

.. take time to preregister.

The'adrninistration cannot be ‘blamed in the case of the

thernumber of students who would enroll, other than by
5 using the preregistration ﬁgures as a basis.

When planning classes and hiring faculty members,
preregistration figures were used as a guide. But a large
percentage of students did not preregist‘er,»and thus caus-
 ing the overﬂow in classes. ,

M The bookstores cannot be criticized for not having an
adequate supply of texts, for they had no ﬁgures but these
by which to approximate the demand for books.

The ‘bookstores cannot be expected to stock up an_ over-
supply of textbooks, for these are too often revised, and
7 would result in a financial loss.

The fault, then, is with the students who were “too

Engineered Hulabaloo

By Jim Vaughn

Here at -Pitt I’ve spent much of. my last two
years in the sixth and seventh ﬂoor libraries. Dur-
ing this time I learned one thing for sure: nothing,
but nothing is. more clamorous than engineers in
a library. .

‘ The other day I went to the sixth floor reference
room to study. The place, I ~
found, was silent; I was soon at
,work. The peace and quiet was
suddenly shattered. At first I
thought a herd of cattle was be-
ing driven into the room. But no,-
the herd was a horde of engi-
' neers.

Before my eyes a host of en-
gineers was descending upon —the
place armed with their slide
rules, ‘lunch pails, book bags,
coats, hats, T—squares, drawing
boards, and various other instruments of higher
learning. I watched as they shuffled my way,
fumbling and stumbling over themselves.

Just as I had feared, they came to my table;
after piling their gear on the table,’ ﬂoor, and win-
dow sills, they started to, work. Surrounding me,
they worked, I guess. But how they. worked!

I‘ know people who can study only. when they
are cragking gum, listening to a bellowing radio, or
eating pistachio nuts. This is only human.

But those engineers were something a.l1..by

themselves. The three sitting on the other side of ‘

my ‘table seemed to be competing with the two on
-my side to see who" could make the most noise.

Next to. me sat a thumping goodgfellow. Al-.
though ‘he worked hard, there was only one thing
wrong —'-his foot. As he rapped.his heel against
the ﬂoor inmavchine-gun fashion, I could almost
see his -tensions discharging into the floor.

Farther to my left, beside the thumper,‘ sat the ’
scratcher studying. All the while I satithere"this_.

junior so-engineer fought a battle —— a losingone —-'-

against something that was apparently biting his‘

leg. . ' ,
‘The grating sound he made‘ had me wondering
about the composition of the -hide_ of these engi-
neers. But that’s another story.
While the scratcher defended his leg, the fel-
low sitting opposite him foraged continuously

through what I guessed was" once ad-briefcase..1I.

heard something coming from that book bag,
something that sounded like tin, glass, and cello-
phane being blended by an egg beater.

Huinan Spirit Eclipsed ...u ‘' -

Brave New

By Rita Flack

When Aldous Huxley wrote “Brave New

World,” the predictions contained in it were meant,

to be fictional ‘prophecies, but ‘the type of world
predicted byliuxley is no longer a mere prophecy:
he has succeeded in portraying the world of nine-
icen hundred and sixty, and if this world is not ‘a
brave one it is certainly. a frighteningly new one.

Huxley prescribed soma for the ‘characters of ‘

his novel, and this opiate granted them artiﬁcial
relief from genuine emotions. We in comparison,
have tranquilizers, the purpose of which is to cause
the human being to fall into hunfeeling happiness
and complacency. If mental pain and the inevitable
anguish thataccompany human life are completely
eliminated," their antitheses -- extreme joy and
exultation —- can no longer be experienced either.

The danger of the twentieth _century is that men .

unable to experience either joy or pain will ‘be-
come like Huxley’s “savage”: they will beat them-
selves with whips "in order to—fmd out whether they
are alive. ‘
There are other symbols of the decadence of the
twentieth century, which, although not speciﬁcally
named by Huxley, still would ﬁt in with his pre-
diction of an inhuman world. The twentieth cen-
tury with its slavish devotion to science and sta-
tistics, reveres the IBM machine. It-is only the
IBM machine which can grant ideato the chaos
of. statistics. . V ’
The moment that people forget that each statis-
tic represents a human being who-is born, suffers,
“and dies, the humanity is converted into a mean-
ingless statistical abstraction
Another result of the reverence for science lies

in our total commitment to the observable, dc-if

_sc_ribable, and rational. 'We“measur_e the immeasur-
able with V-meaningless questionnaires, and submit

  

 

B¢¢.avS¢i of   the 

I couldn’t avoid noticing that beside the fomger
sat a cacophonous cohort who was feverishly
scribbling numbers on a paper and erasing them.
.He rocked the table and me back and forth as he
reduced his once-white sheet of paper into a
tattered smear.

Directly across from me was a fellow wearing
a blue unbuttoned shirt with trolled-up sleeves.
He studied as if he didn’t hear the racket at our
table. His silence told me that he couldn’t be an
engineer. But I thought too soon.

I looked -up from my book just as he reached
into his lunch bag and .drew out a sandwich. What
I saw I couldn’t believe; without taking his/eyes
from his book, he tore off the wax paper and_.bit
into the sandwich. - -

That sandwich was the loudest sandwich I ever
heard. It sounded and looked like peanut brittle
on rye.

Under the weight of 511 this crunching, erafsing,’
scribbling, scratching, and thumping’ my tympanic:

/

membrane and I weakened. Together we ﬂed to—_'

the quiet of the Tuck Shop.

I have had many similar experiences with engi-I '

neers in the ‘Fine Arts Library. The Reserve Book

Room one floor below is even worse when the

engineers move in.
I've watched them tromp in, stumblingover
chairs and tables, knocking over everything within

their reach, p-lowing their way to the table of some‘

unfortunate student, and leaving behind a trail of
chaos and disorder. . e

"I often wonderwhat makes these Knights of the,

A Slide» Rule so raucous in the libraries.

~ It’s not because they’re .all crude or insensitiveé .
to the feelings of «others, because there must be,“

.-some "socialized considerate ‘ones around ‘here -'-
somewhere. ° '
I think‘ rather that engineers ar"e instinctively

ﬂipping the pages of a notebook, thrashing apiece

of paper. with an eraser, and shufﬂingand yelling ‘

and. crunching and ‘thumping all over school would_

too.

~ ‘I bet thatgif full-ﬂedged engineers-‘couldn’t raise”

,a lot of clamor while they work, rnountains

drawii*t'o engineering; it seems only ‘natural to me‘ 
that people who have _a natural talent for madly _ '-

want to be. engineers. " And I believe this is good, ~_ ‘

wouldn’t be moved, gorges would stay unspanned,,  I

and wildernesses, would remain unconquered.

So, I say, give all .the engineers a big‘. can and
a stick and let them make all the noise they want.
But don’t let them in the libraries. /

‘World of 1960 
' natural human desire to impose unity and nation-
ality upon every aspect of his being, ‘man has '

chosen to disregard the somewhat disunited and
irrational nature of his reallife: In doing so, he
" has deprived the human personality of one of the
only di.gnities which it possesses; man can no longer
strive for self—understanding, because he thinks
that the:IBM machine can do this job invhalf the
time and come outwith perfect answers.
The only thing thatthe IBM machine can’t do is
choose the questions whichare submitted to it at
the beginning. If it could do this, its icy inhuman

intelligence would warn it that perhaps man lii.m- *‘

self should concentrate onstruggling -with the ques-
tions .to which there are no answers, rather. than
on feeding the IBM machine merely answerable
questions. —

Certainly, one cannotwbe so naive as to think
that a dynamic industrialized society can exist
without'som'e amount‘ of dehumanization. The im-
portant thing is not to permit soma, IBM machines,
and statistics, to become" the central concerns‘ of
modern man’s life. There are still the universal
and’ insoluble questions with which the human
spirit has wrestled since man-became conscious of
himself. These should be among -the central con-
cerns of modern man. If they are not, the twen-
tieth century has regressed, not progressed.

you do, naturally, is to offer the young lady a Marlboro. Be . '

sure, however, to offer her an entire Marlboro-not just a
Marlboro butt. Marlboro butts are good of course, but whole

Marlboros are better. You get an extra inch or two of line *

ﬂavorful tobacco-and I mean ﬂavorful. Do you think ﬂavor
went out wheniilt/ers came in? Well, you've "got to happy sur-
prise coming when you light 9/Marlboro. This one really de-
livers the goods on ﬂavor, and when you hand Isobel, Winifred,
or Daphne a whole, complete, brand-new Marlboro, she will
,lmo’w how highly you regard and respect her, and she will grow‘
misty and weak with gratitude, which is very important when
you take her out to dinner, because the onlykind of coed 2.
college man can afford to feed is a weak and misty coed. Latest
statistics show that a coed in a normal condition eats one and
a half times her own weight every twelve hours.

At. the end of your date with Isabel, Winifred, or Daphne, ,

make certain to get her home by curfew time. T hat is gentle-
manly. Do not leave her at a bus stop. That is rude. Deliver
her right to her door and, if_ possible, stop the car when you are.

Olympic Athletes

jig Penn Relays

 

By JACK SMITH

One of "the greatest aggregations of athletes ever as-
sembled were at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia last week-

—

By JACK SMITH

N o jinx, many breaks, and the Panthers had a successful
weekend at the 66th Annual Penn Relays.

The Panthers went down to Philadelphia last Friday and
Saturday with the idea in mind of coming home victorious,
and for the ﬁrst time in several years the Cats did just-that
as they captured two relay championships, a ﬁrst_ and three

end, and I had the privilege of witnessing their athletic ef-

. forts.

Whenever great athletics are assembled in one place
there are bound to be records tied and broken, last Saturday
was no exception.

Boston University’s John Thomas stepped up to the high
jump and easily cleared the bar at 7 feet ll/2 inches toset a
world’s record. To me it was one of the most memorable ath-
letic‘ experiences of my life. And the 30,000 other people who
witnessed the event it must have made an impression to see
‘a man reach a height that a few years ago was considered a
physical impossibility. -
0 Most of the outstanding athletes were there because

of the Olympics which will be held this Fall. They were
entered in Olympic development events and fast times
in these races could qualify’ them for Olympic competi-
tion. ’ -

Let’s take a lookat the runners in the Olympic Develop-
ment 100-meter Dash. There was Olympic 100 and 200-meter
dash champion Bobby Morrow’, Ray Norton, Bill Woodhouse,
Dave Sime and Ira Muchison. This was perhaps’ the fastest
group of sprint men in the world. Norton won the-event in

410.5, a slow time, but the race was run against a wind.

Norton then easily won the,Olympic Development -200-
meter dash in 20.6 seconds. Incidentally this time equalled
the world’s record, around the turn, for this event. Other run-
ners were Sime, Ed Collymore, and Morrow. Again it was
one of the best group of runners ever assembled, outside of
the Olympics.

In the 100-meter high hurdles Hayes Jones, National
AAU Champion, ran (‘he event in 13.6 which was the
fastest time run in the country this year. This race was ,'
also run against a wind. Olympic winner Lee Calhoun,
Jas Ball and Charles Pratt were a few of America’s top
hu.rdlers in this event. . V

There was Don Bragg in the pole vault; Gregory'Be1l,
1956 Olympic champion in the broad jump; "John C. Ellis
in the discus throw, and John Lawlor, who holds the Ameri-
can Collegiate Record in the hammer throw, not to mention
the host of other top college and amateur performers.

Most of the activity centered around high school and
college relay races. The fastest team‘_in the relays was San

 Jose State.

Yale’s two-mile -relay ‘team surprised everyone by

setting a Carnival record clipping the course in'7:27.4.
The Penn Relay Carnival was a big preview of America’s
track and ﬁeld squad, .a team which will represent us in
the coming Olympics. ' '

in ﬁeld events. -

Actually the reason the Pan-
thers were successful was not be-
cause of an overabundance of

of relay entries.

Bothvthe sprint medley relay
and the mile relay had to be run
in sections. The Panthers happen-
ed to get into a weak sections
and won both races,

In the sprint medley relay, a
team of Bill Hinchberger; Mel
Barnwell, Jim Donahue and _Ron‘
Rush won the event in 3:3-2.5.
Hinchberger ran the 440-yard

leaders as the baton was passed
to Barnwell. '

yard dash pulled the Panthers .up

the second 220 in 22. seconds
the lead, Rush ran a slow 1:56.8
half mile but it was enough to
give the Panthers a win.

Panther took advantage’ of a slow
section to win ..in 3:20.4. When
Reed Clarke ran the opening 440
in 52.2, it looked as though the
Panthers might ﬁnish.last,.but a
49.9 by Dave Kelly and .a .50.3 ‘by
Hinchberger brought the Cats
near the front" of the pack.

talent but to. an overabundance

dash in 52.2 and fell behind the “

Barnwell, running a 21-.1 220- '~
and passed to Donahue who ran A

which brought‘ the Panthers into ’

.Again,-in the mile relay the.

Once Barnwell took the baton
there was no question about the
winner as he streaked home in
48 seconds flat. ’

The Panthers relay times were
slow, but if they had run in the
section with Vill-anova, who ran
the event in 3:1‘2.2, the Panthers

might have been pushed to a fast-

er time. But i_t’s safe to assume
that Coach Carl Rees was glad
to come ‘away from the relays
with a fewpwins.

The Panthers only ﬁrst place
winner in the ﬁeld events was
Dick Chadwick,’ who won the
college hammer throw with 159
feet 81/; inches. This event was
held on Friday along‘ with the
discus throw. Dan Kanell picked
up a fourth in the championship
with a throw of 161’ 4".

In other competition Larry Och
made the ﬁnal of the champion-
ship shot put with a of 51’-1”
then placed fourth in, the ﬁnals
by uncoiling, the shot 52 feet 8%

_ Regis Goggin tied for fourth in
the high jump, but was in the

John Thomas. Thomas easily

Coach Bobby Lewis’ Pan-

State Teachers College put a

fmonkey wrench into the Pan-.

ther machine. Riding a three
game winning streak, after losing
their ﬁrst five, the Panthers look-
ed like the team the pre—season
ratings said it was.

But Indiana changed all that as
they handed the Cats two straight
-losses on Saturday. After narrow-
ly escaping a loss in the ﬁrst game
Indiana really put the Panthers‘
to shame in the second one by
hammering out a 10-2 win.

The score of the first game was

M ‘8-6. Indiana took a4-0 lead in

the fourth inning only to see the
Panthers bounce back to within
one run. It looked like the Pan-
thers were going to pull a come-
from—behind win when Bobby
New, Panther second string catch-
er, belted a three run homer in
the fifth.

After that the Cats had many
opportunities to tie it up and go
ahead but they just couldn’t get
the clutch hit. The second game

when Indiana, leading 2-1, scor-

New Opening Bid Convention
Overpowers Opponents’ Hands

(This is the first in alseries ofbridge colum-ns by John

Lowemhat.)

By JOHN LOWENTHAL '

‘Traditionally, an open bid of two of a suit is used on a‘

the king of diamonds you came

make seven. Your opening bid on
this hand would be two spades.
Such hands as these are unfor-

ttunately rare, so a few years ago
some ﬁne players decided to use
wopening bids of 2D, 2H, and 2S
' for a very different type of hand,
uopening 2C on all powerhouses

and showing the true long suit
later. The new opening two—bids
were called “weak twos.” They
would be used on hands contain-
ing ‘a good six-card suit and about
8-11 points.

While weak twos describe these
hands well, their main, purpose is

I to-rob the opponents of bidding

space. While they are rather

, _tricky in their ramiﬁcation and

not recommended for beginners,
when correctly used they can be

’.one of the most devastating weap-

ons in bridge. The following hand

. shows a very effective weak two:

North-South lose three dia-

make two spades while East-West
could have made four hearts!

Such a hand is S-AKQJ-xxxx, H—void, D—AxX, C-KQ,
“You can make four spades opposite anything your partner
‘ may have, and if he holds as little as the ace of clubs and

Without the weak two the bid-
ding probably would have gone:

The weak two-bid thus gains
730 points (the difference between
two spades bid and made, and
four hearts bid and made) for
North-South while risking little.

A warning, though. Don’t try
the weak two until you under-
stand bidding pretty thoroughly.
If you open a weak two and your
partner has a good hand, the bid-
ding may become very complicat-
ed.

Mood,-.Spirit of Year Depicted

Owl Reviews Trimester as Theme if

_Depicting the mood and spirit
of the ﬁrst trimester year is the
main theme of the 1959-60 Owl,

as explained by Ron Scott, past"

editor.

“Although many, people have
been interpreting its national im-
pact, and disgressingabout its ad-
vantages and disadvantages, the
ﬂrst 88 pages of the Owl will leave
something tangible about the tri-
mester,” he explained.

These pages will be printed in
brown-toned ink‘ on ivory stock
paper,_istead of the usual black
on white enamel. Instead of cap-

‘tions, there will be one short para-

graph for each double-page spread
interpreting what each e v e n t
means.

Mood summaries from cam-

pus seasons to single events 4

such as Khruschev's visit, will
be depicted on "each of, these

pages.
Scott said, “To a certain degree,
w‘ have concentrated on the aca-

demic side of school life, how-

ever,- we have not gone over-
board.”

“We are taking a mildly posi-
tive view of the trimester, he con-
tinued,
it’s story.” The remaining sec-
tions of the book will concentrate
upon usual campus events.
