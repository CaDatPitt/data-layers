Ancient English Ceremony

To Transform Senior Coed
Slpnto Her Royal Majesty

Dean Of Women Adapts,Original Coronation
Of Anglo-Saxon King To Meet Needs
Of Modern Pitt Campus

A blare of trumpets, then a roll of drums-—and the
campus is changed into the setting for royalty. A

The sweep of grass is greensward, the elms and ‘maples
ancient English yews. For it is an ancient Anglo-Saxon back-
ground which they are to make, -and moreover, one for
royalty. Though the year is 1931, the spirit is centuries
younger, for the coronation of the Queen of the senior women

As closely as possible, it follows the
crowning of the old Anglo Saxon
kings and queens.

Queen Margaret wears the same
type of heavy velvet, and her dark
waves are crowned with a mass of
bejeweled old just as weighty as
that worn y her predecessor over
ten centuries ago.

In the adaptation of the ceremony
made by Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
wémen, the bishop, who “swears the
queen in” is replaced by Alma Mater
who, in the crowning of the Pitt
queen, takes the leading part.

Otherwise, a black-robed choir in
the background chants the same
quaint lines to the same music. And,
after the ceremony, the queen’s
treasurer scatters largesse to the
crowd, while the court jester amuse:
with her quaint antics.

Although the ceremony, when
adapted for the senior women’.-3 class,
automatically was meant to exclude
all men, the brawnier element have
still to be replaced. For every year
four band-members toot the trumpet
and beat the drum that the new
queen may have an unobstructed ap-
proach.

At Last Dinner Meet

of ‘Student Council officers
Wednesday evening with the-
result that Lowman Latta, a

junior in that school, landed in
the chair as president of the
student governinglgroup next year.
The meeting, last of the year and
held amid the sweltering heat of an,
off-campus restaurant, was further
distinguished by election of Richard:
Phifer, Bus. Ad. ’32, vice president;
Adelaide’Hunter, Col. ’32, secretary,
and James McAfee, Mines ’32,treas-
urer.
In addition to all this, heads of
the various standing committees
were elected and the group decided
to try its‘ hand once more at stag-
ing freshman ‘regulations next; fall.
To Robert Beck, Col. ’32, a newly.
elected member of the governing
body, was entrusted this job of sub-
jecting freshmen to caps and black
ties next September. The usual de-
bate of “Traditions versus Impres-

regulations with the former argu-
ment evidently being the more con-'

of regulations next. year was unan-

.Election of the ‘standing commit-'3
tee chairmen went through with all
the precision of a well-oiled clock.
The sl-ate was clearly made up prior
to the meeting and all that was
necessary was for the president to
ask for nominations and the sup-
porters of the new chairmen were
there with their man and an im-

tions.‘ .

One ﬂaw apparently crept into the
machinery, for in electing the chair-
man of the elections committee it
was necessary to cast a ballot with
two candidates being put. forth.
These two were Paul Best, Col. ’32,,
and Eddie Baker, Dent. ’32. Baker
won out.

Chairmen of other important
council positions line up as follows:
John Bowman, Bus. Ad. ’32, student
relations committee; Edith Hirsch,
Ed. ’32, constitution committee; John
Stirling, Eng. ’32, assembly commit-
tee, and Reed Rose, Dent. ’33, in-
vestigation committee.

Acting u on the recommendation
of the 193 Yuletide festival com-
mittee, Adelaide Hunter was named
temporary chairman of this annual
observance. A constitutional tech-
nicality prevented Council from
making Miss Hunter permanent
chairman, no matter how the senti-

in her favor. The recently revised

Sun Stronger Than  Wind,
Cathedral. Study Proves

By EDWARD PECK S

The Cathedral of Learning moves
more because of the effect of the
sun than the effect of the wind, ac-
cording to the results‘ obtained by
Herbert Lebrenz, Robert Frew and
William Himes, seniors in civil en-
gineering, who have‘ been working
on this topic for their thesis prob-
lem.

The results of the work this year
are more signiﬁcant than those of
last year because of the im-prove-
ment in the apparatus used. A shed
was built at the bottom of one of
the elevator shafts and the tele-
scope was set solidly into the ce-
ment in a permanent position
throughout the whole year. Last
year the telescope had to be taken
to a safe place after, the end of
each day’s work. —

The method by which‘ the stu-
dents measured the movement was
much simpler than any one would
naturally expect. An astronomical
telescope with a magniﬁcation power
of three hundred diameters was
lined up with a target at the top
o-f the building. The target was a
board, one foot square, with a co-
ordinate system of one inch squares
laid out upon it. Each of these
squares was divided into tenths; so
the scale readings would be more
easily taken and more accurate. Two
cross-hairs of the telescope ap-
peared in the image of the target;
any movement changed the position
of the cross-hairs.

WIND VELOCITY TESTED

The velocity of the wind was de-
tected by a four-cupped anemome-
ter placed at the highest point of
the Cathedral. This was connected
into an electric bell circuit. When-
ever it had turned through one mile
of wind, the bell in the students’ ob-
servatory rang. By recording the

interval between rings of.’ the bell

they were able to calculate the ve-
locity of the wind.-

At ﬁrst the students were primar-
ily concerned with the movement in
the Cathedral caused by the wind
acting upon it. Whenever a strong
wind came up, they went, if at all
possible, to their observatory and
took data for their thesis. Ofteﬁ-
times walking about on the icy steps
into a strong wind‘ made their task

dangerous as well as difficult.» They I

found the maximum movement at
the top of the Cathedral caused by
the wind to be .44 of an inch.
During one of their discussions
with H. G. Balcom, consulting en-
gineer for the Cathedral, the sugges-
tion was made that the sun might
affect the movement of the Cathe-
dral. The students decided to make
a twenty-four-hour‘ study of the
movement to see if thetemperature

of the atmosphere really did affect H

the movement.

SUN SI-IINES BRIGHT

The time they chose for the test
worked out, ideally. It was cold
all night and the next day the sun
shone brightly.‘ There was. prac-
tically no wind inﬂuence throughout
the entire day—-the average velocity
only being about four miles per
hour. .

After they had made all their cal-
culations for this experiment, they
found that apparently the sun had
moved the buildin more than the
wind had. They p otted curves and
found the movement to be in a semi-
circular direction. The building re-
ceded before the sun. Twenty-four
hours after the ﬁrst reading was
taken, the building moved .695 of
an inch from its ﬁrst position.

One favorable result of the work ‘

this year is that it totally disproved
the popular conception that tall
buildings sometimes sway as much
as a foot or two. The explanation
given for the movement made by the
sun acting upon it is’ that the sun
warmed one side of the building and
caused it to expand and shove the
Cathedral toward its shady side.

Their telescope was loaned by Al-
legheny Observatory.

 

Experiment Witli New‘
Employment Bureau

In order to increase the scope of
ﬁnding part-time positions for men,
reorganization of the Employment
Bureau for men is being effected,

which if successful during the sum- '

mer will become permanent.

Lester H. Perry, director of the
Employment and Housing Bureau,
will leave his oﬁice to establish con-
tact with various ﬁrms in and out
of the city which can give part-time
employment to_ students.

. B. Williams, at present in
charge of the part-time employment,
will take charge of Mr. Perry’s of-
ﬁce. He will have complete charge
of full-time employment and of the
housing bureau. , '

Miss Dorothy Cameron, secretary
of the Employment and Housing Bu-
reau, will assume the part-time du-

BUREAU HOUSES

Report Made By L. H. Perry,
Housing Director; Rooms All
Inspected, Approved

More than 722 Pitt men who are’
living away from home were af-
fected by compulsory housing regu-
lations during the school ‘year of
1930-31, according to Lester H. Per-
ry, director of the housing and em-
ployment bureau. The men affected
were freshmen and sophomores who
are required to live in houses in-
spected and approved by the hous-
ing department. Two hundred and
forty-four houses were approved
during the year.

Three hundred students signed
contracts with their landlords, copies
of which were ﬁled with the depart-
ment. In addition, the landlords of
the approved houses signeli housing
agreements with the housing depart-
ment agreeing to,fulﬁl1 such re-
quirements as maintaining quiet for
study, proper heating, etc.

Out-of-town freshmen and sopho-
stayed with relatives
aware not required to ﬁle contracts
with the department. Of this group
there were 176 during the year.

While the above ﬁgures apply
only to freshmen and sophomores,
service by the housing department
is also offered voluntarily to jun-
iors and seniors, graduate students
and faculty members. The depart-
ment publishes three lists of hous-
ing accommodations:

1. Approvved rooms for underclass

students; .

2. Rooms for upperclass-men,

graduate students and faculty;

3. Houses and apartments, both

furnished and unfurnished. _

{HITTING AWAY FROM our

{ice to mention a few of the ath-
létic accomplishments of the past
year at Pitt. . .the most important
happenings of the year was the ad-
dition of boxing and golf to the ath-
7-Jlétic program as minor sports. . .

 

p Neither one of these teams won a .

single match during the season, but

graceful. . .Joe Orsini, a sophom-ore

remarks, we again remind you that
this is the last issue of the year. . .
the fact that we may not write this
column next September will likely
cause a furore. . . ? ? ? . . .

Before we leave, however, we are
reminded that there have been a few
times in the past in which we did

state crown. They proved easier for

The giant cadet scored four ﬁeld
goals and seven out of eight fouls
to score three-ﬁfths of his team's
points.

The feature of this trip was Lu-
bic’s consistent foul shooting. He
scored 16 out of 24 in the first game,
9 out of 11 in the next game, and
8 out of 11 i.n each of the last two
games, a total of 41 successful at-
tempts in 57 shots for a percentage
of 71.94. 4 '

League games that year were

two games with the latter team
were played,ﬁrst and the Panthers
won both, 28-19 and 45-25. Penn
State split even in its two tilts with

A playoff game was scheduled
with Harrisburg as the original site.
but when the basketball court there
was unobtainable, the game was
switched to Duquesne Garden in
Pittsburgh.

That game was close throughout

less than seven times. State had a

24-9, at the end of the ﬁrst half.

Swarthmore tightened up in the
secondhalf, but the lead which Pitt
had gained during the ﬁrst half of
the game proved, too great an ob-
stacle to overcome and the Eastern-
ers ‘had to content themselves with
the defeat. I ‘ ‘

LUBIC ‘STARS .

Bern Lubic was the star of the
game for the Panthers, scoring four
ﬁeld goals and ten out of twelve
foul shots. Matson scored six more
ﬁeld goals for the Panthers, while
and Captain
Butch Ochsenhirt also entered the
Pitt scoring column.

One other game» was played that
year with Allegheny. 'I‘-he Meth-
odists were then the leading colle-
giate basketball team in the country
and boasted Qf victories in 85 per
cent of their games for the ten
years previous. They won over the
Panthers 34-21, but not until they
had played in one of their hardest
games of the season. '

The basketball championship was
the second sport title to be won by
the Panthers that year, for the Pitt
team went through
schedule undefeated. The following
year, Pitt’s football team enjoyed
another perfect record, while the
' 0388 team -won ﬁfteen

PITTGDLF TEAM owes
LIFE To SAM PARKS

I-Iis big project now a thing of
the past, Captain Sam Parks glances
inpretrospect to what he and his
cohorts have accomplished. For
quite some time there existed a de-
mand’ for a Pitt varsity golf team
and variousattempts were made to
formulate one. - ’ _v

Working along with Director W.
Don Harrison, Parks started to make
plans to organize a team and map
out a schedule.» All this was diffi-
cult as most of , the colleges that
foster golf had their schedules made

‘up. A good schedule was made con-

sidering that it was already late in
the year; but matches were lined up
with Notre Dame, Georgetown and
George Washington.

These matches were won by our
opponents, but the Pitt men showed’
up well and gave hopes of future
great golf teams in Pitt’s athletic
history. The most redeeming fea-
ture of the golf season was the con-
tinual ﬁne performances turned in
by Captain Sam. Sam returned to
Pitt after the Easter vacation, hav-
ing gone to the ﬁnals in the Pine-
hurst tournament, where he was at
length defeated by his old rival,
George Dunlap of Princeton.

Continuing in his early champion-
ship form, Sam went through his
collegiate year without dropping

Pitt Spilzers Lose
To Penn State

Pitt’s varsity and freshman track
teams were unable to stop the rush
of State trackmen at the stadium
last Saturday’ and lost freshman and
varsity dual meets. Both Pitt teams
lost by practically the same scores,
the varsity’s being 81-54, and the
Cubs 811,4-53%. Rain and a cold
wind handicapped the runners, but
Meisinger and King, both of State,

ran a dead heat in the two-mile run-

to break the stadium record with
times of nine minutes, 48 seconds.

Utterback was the individual star
for Pitt, winning the hundred, broad
jump and pole vault, placing second
in the 220 and tying for ﬁrst in the
high jump, for a total of 22 points.
Harris. with a. victory in the 220,
helped swell Pitt’s total, as did
Johnny Luch, with ﬁrsts in the dis-
cus and shot-put and a second in
the hammer throw.

Milligan, Keller and Guay ac-
counted for most of Pitt’s points in
the track events, while O’Dell, Se-
bastian and Love looked good in
winning the pole vault, broad jump
and discus, respectively. 5 - , ’

‘ly defeated them.

match. This is all the more extra- ~

ordinary when it is considered that
Sam met the two best collegiate
players in Washington and decisive-

W-ithin the next week, Sam en-
trains for Chicago where herwill
carry Pitt’s banners in the national
intercolle-giates. Here, all Sam's old
rivals will be waiting to take over
the most-feared man, in collegiate
circles. Due to his ﬁne low rounds
in tough competition, Sam is re-
garded as the man to beat at Chi-
cage.

The future of the Pitt golf team
is assured as we have some of the
best of the younger golf stars com-
ing to Pitt. Foremost among these
is Regis Wolff, the West Penn Junior
champ, from whom much is ex-
pected, so much, that he is expected
to ﬁll the shoes of Parks who is
graduating. Then there is’Leonard
Rupert, who was formerly number
one man at Washington and Lee,
but is still eligible for varsity com-
petition. From the last varsity team
will be Jim Irwin, who is expected
to be a greatly improved player
next year,’ and Charles Wolff, the
older brother of this golﬁng family.

The outlook is particularly prom-
ising. Director W. D. Harrison is
arranging a difficult schedule which
will include most of the big schools
sponsoring golf teams. Some of
these are Notre Dame, Georgetown,
Michigan, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell and Lehigh.

HOPES HIGH FOR
1932 TRACKMEN

Utterback, Kopnicki, Va r s it y
' Men To Graduate; Frosh
Material Promising ‘

Although this season's track rec-
ord shows losses to Army,
State, Penn State and West Vir-
ginia twice, with but one victo
against Carnegie Tech, and althoug
Utterback and Kopnicki have com-
pleted their allotted period of com-
peition, Coach" Shea can" still look
forward to a successful season next
year as he reviews this year’s
freshman cindermen and those of
the varsity who will be ‘back next

year. . . .
The loss of Utterback alone

means the loss of at least ten points

per meet, and Kopnicki could al-
ways be counted upon to turn in ‘a
good performance in the javelin
throw. a N

In the century dash, as well as in
the 220, Pitt will have to choose
between Harris, Milligan, Miller and
Vitulla.. Vitulla, a 'letterm'a_n last
year, but out this season with abad
knee, should be ready again next
spring. Keller and Monheim will
ﬁght it out for the 440 and 880, but
from past records, Keller should be
number one man for these‘ events.
Demarchi and Russ May,-freshmen,
will likewise be available for these
two events.

Pitt willbe weak in the longer dis-
tance runs but will have Watkins.
Schmieler and Lawrence. ,Lawrence
ran well for thefrosh this year and
is looked upon to help, Watkins, who
should improve, and Schmieler. »In
the timber-topping division. @Shea
will have his choice of Lewis, Se-
bastian, Guay and Simms. Simms,
who did not try out this year, is. a
former W-. P. I. A. L. champion.
Much is expected» of him-. ,

Pitt looks better in the ﬁeld
events. than track. with both this
year’s frosh and varsity men ﬁght-
ing for the positions. Johnny Luc-h
will be the mainstay in the shot-
put and discus, as well as in the
hammer throw. In the high jump,
Shea will have Kirkpatrick, Stirling,
Trembath, Ball, Bogda and Sebas-
tian. O’Dell and‘ McConnell,
vie for the pole vault, while Stirl-
ing and. Sebastian will carry Pitt
hopes in the broad jump.’ Stirling
ﬁrst attracted attention ‘by winning
the high ‘jump ‘and broad jump in

then earned enough pointsvin var-
sity competition to win his letter.

Concrete Supports, Beams
Shbw Progress On Institute

lWork on the foundation of the new
Mellon Institute of Industrial Re-
search, now under construction on
the corner of Fifth. and Belleﬁeld
avenues, is progressing rapidly.
Foundation walls have been com-
pleted and concrete reinforcing sup-
ports and beams are under construc-
tion at present. _
Excavation for the Institute,
which was completed last March af-
ter five months of work, is the_larg-
est ever made in the city. Ninety-
seven thousand cubic yards of soil
were removed. Erection of the edi-

R ﬁce, requiring two years, will be

completed in 1932. ,

The structure of -the Institute will
be carried out in the Ionic style of
classical Greek architecture. It will
be plain, but massive, resembling the
Lincoln Memorial in style of con-
-struction. Sixty—two huge columns
will line the immense sides of the‘
ediﬁce. Although containing eight
working ﬂoors, the building will give
off a low, flat, but spacious appear-
ance. Its proportions will be approx-
imately 300 by 275 feet. _

Steps «extending along the entire
front of the Institute will lead up to
the main entrance which will be lo-
cated on the fourth floor of the
building- Laboratories on different
ﬂoors will face interior courts.

The‘ newbuilding will be the larg-

est research institute in the world.
It will be ﬁve times larger than the
resent Institute comprised of two
uildings.

The project of a new home_for the
Institute was taken up_ early in Maya
1930, when it was decided that pres-
ent buildings were madeq‘-1398 €04’
immediate and future  of Its
departments and industrial fellow-
ships. For this purpose and for ex-
panding ‘its research facilities and
activities in both pure_ and applied
science, this commodious modern
structure was decided upon. _ _
Though allied with the University
the Institute is under 8. Separate
corporation and has its own board of
trlstees. On May  changes Were
made in the executive staff. Due to
the resignation of L. W. Bass as ex-
ecutive assistant, L. H. Cretcher.
head of the department of research
in pure chemistry since 192_4. was
appointed to an assistant director-
ship. The executive staff is com-
prised of E. R. Weidlein, director.
and assistants, L. H. Cretcher. E-_ W-
Tillotson, W. A. Hamor, H. S. Gale-
man and G. D. Beal.

When completed next year,_ the
new home of the Mellon Institute
will be a vital and signiﬁcant con-

-“Our program then included only
the Monday noon meetings, which
were of. a religious and social serv-
ice" nature,” said Mrs. Dice. “We had
no visions of the Y. W. as such a
highly organized unit as it now is,
and felt we did not have the time
for more than the one weekly meet-
ing. . .

. Mrs.‘ Dice was one of the ﬁrst of-
ficers of the organization, and was
also one of.‘ the two delegates sent

According to the certiﬁcate of
award, the Record was selected “for
ﬁtness in accomplishing the speciﬁc
task for which it was created, as
well as the artistry and craftsman-
ship with which it was prepared.”
“It was chosen for its merits from
a group of representative» specimens
exhibited at the Fourth Annual Ex-
hibit of the Pittsburgh Advertising
Club.” The Decembernumber of the
Record was selected by the judges as
the outstanding numberof the year
lrom the standpoint of ‘art work and
design. This was the’, issue which
contained the eight pen sketches on
Pittsburgh subjects by L. Paul
Schweinberg, and the “Footnote to
R. L. Duffus,” by George Ketchum.
Following the exhibit, the collec-
tion of prize winners" in all the vari-
ous groups were sent to New York
City, to be shown there and in other
cities under the auspices of the In-
ternational Advertising Association.
Several articles by Pitt faculty
members will feature the June-July
numberof the Pittsburgh Record, a

which have been urged upon us in
recent times.

Carl‘ B. Cass has tried his hand
at almost every phase of the theater
game:- costuming, make-up, stage
managing, and of course, acting.
Which probably accounts for the
fact that _he has proven such an
astute dramatic director and devel-
oped the Pitt Players into one of the
finest groups of amateur thespians
in this district.

Out West in Minnesota, Director
Cass received his undergraduate
training where he partici ted in 18
presentations. During t e summer
months at school, he says, “I used
to organize a group of players and
we toured the Chatauqua circuit.”
After graduation his varied experi-
ences found him at work in a Chi-
cago costume house, later engaged
at the Goodman Theater, employed
as a stage-manager of a Minnesota
stock company, a member of a stock
trou e, then to the Mercersberg
Aca emy where he taught for a year
which led him to his present posi-
tion at the University.

. We thrust our customary bom-
bardment of questions: What sort of
roles have you played during your
career. He smiled, laughed abrupt-
1y," andsaid, “Well . . . I guess I've
played almost everything,” and he
went on to name the more familiar
of the surprisingly diverse roles he
has‘ portrayed: the Father in Six
Characters in7Search of an Author
. . . He in Andreyev’s He Who Gets
Slapped (which he hoped to produce
here) .-. . Giovanni in Paolo and
Francesca, . . . Sir Peter Teazle in
The School for Scandal . . . John

‘Ferguson in -the play of -that name

. . . Antonio in‘ the Lady of Belmont

and Othello . . . Without being inter-
rogated, he continued, “I like to play
the more extreme comedy and trag-
ical roles ranging from Sir Peter
Teazle to Othello . . . I have made
a. specialty of dumb comedy. serv-
ants . . .” Altogether he has played
in 100 productions.

The perennial question popped
into mind, “What do you think of
the advisability of going .on the
stage?”

It seemed that if you were in-
terested in art for art’s sake, all‘
well and good, but if you were
anticipating much remuneration,
well . . . you were on the wrong
track. Advises Mr. Cass, “If you
like the work as a hobby, go into it
as a hobby . . . On the stage it is all
pull; you must have connections;
you must know a friend of a friend
. . . The only resort for one with
theatrical ambitions is to try and
beat the racket, and if he knows
what he is up against, he won't try.”
. Mr. Cass, among other things,
voiced his antagonism- against the
despicable system of type-casting
and discussed the instability of an
actor’s ‘income and employment.-

Glancing ahead, he “looks for the
biggest development in the Little
Theater . . . since the war it has had
a phenomenal growth and is doing
very creditable things.‘ Groups like
the Theater Guild will spring up in
every city.” .

With the future of the theater
made known .to us, we left him at
his paint and brush-cluttered desk
to continue’ his innumerable duties
as director of Pitt Players, paint-
ing a bookcase for his latest enter-
prise, “Alice Sit By The Fire.”.

The "Pitt” fortiﬁcation, however,
was only a part of the mammoth un-
dertaking of the city to protect her-
self _fromL.Lee’s conquering army as
it marched North. For when, on
June 12, 1863, ‘-‘the Governor an-
nounced that invasion of the State
was imminent,” the city literally ﬂew
to the hills, not for safety, but for
defense. If the enemy came it would
be from the East. East of Pitts-
burgh is East Liberty; that approach
must hold the greatest obstacle to
the invading force, if the city was
to remain undestroyed. Consequently
one of the greatest fortiﬁcations of
the city was built on the hill above
“Pitt” facing East Liberty.

resistance. “It swept the entire East

In Exam Procedure

Don’t‘ blame
see University students drive up to

Alumni I-lalldlext’ week in horse-“

drawn“ cabs,‘ and strideinto their ex-
amination rooms, attired in high silk
hats, dress shirts, dress suits and
white gloves. A A
Maybe it’s_ just a quaint PoldPGer-

man custom that’s spread to the New ‘

World», from Leipzig University, in

est wrinkle in examination procedure

, for years and years and years, ac-
‘ cording to Dr. John M. Ferguson, as-

sistant professor? of economics, who

i received his doctor’s degree at that

institution duringthe early years of
the World_ War. ’ r
‘Proceeding to, enlighten us on

Leipzig L examination procedure, Dr.

Ferguson stated that once having
convinced the examiners of his abil-
ity by writing a book on’ his chosen
subject, the applicant for a degree is
subjected to a three-hour oral;..ex-
«amination in German. He is greeted
in the examillation, chamber by a
sem-circle of about ten men, all for-
“mally attired, who work in relays in
ﬁring questions at him. ‘

,.If their purpose was to awe the
young American railroad expert,
however, they failed disma1ly,”fer
Dr. Ferguson maintains that his
Leipzig examination was far easier
than the one he later took, at Colum-
bia, in the U. S. A. He supposes
that the simplicity of the examina-
tion was probably due to the desire

of the examiners for information‘

concerning American economic con-
ditions. Consequently. theIexa.mina-
tion gradually resolved itself into a
recital by the then Mr. Ferguson, of
the in-.formatio,n’ desired. No differ-
entiation is made at Leipzig as to
the respective abilities of. the appli-
cants; they are either granted or re-
fused degrees, as is the ‘universal
custom in Germany.

‘Studying the railroad structure of
Germany, Dr. Ferguson attended,
between the two three-month ses-
sions at Leipzig, the universities at
Heidelberg, Munich, Hallo, Boun,
and "Berlin. He embodied the re-
sults of his study in his doctor’s
thesis, a comparison of Germany’s
railroad systems, which at that time
were owned by the numerous, inde-
pendent states.

closed by Dr. Alfred PL.;James.II)ro-

Instead of preparing for examina-
tions by cramming until‘ 4 o'clock in
the morning,-as Pitt students will be
doing next week, the typical Oxford
student purchases copies of past, ex-
aminations at the University book-

store_.. studies the answers to them,

and considers himself primed for-the
rofessors’ worst. - This _ procedure
ars the stamp of approval of the
ed-ucators at . this ancient English

university, stated Dr. James..,

A pfurther assistance in preparing
for examinations, was the so-called

“cram books.” These were published

and sold, by the?t_ea‘chers.and tutors
and consisted of outlines andnotes

on the material covered in the

course. i .

A ‘distinctive feature T of the-. Oxford
examination was the fact that all the
major, examinations were given in a

«huge building which was used for

that purpose alone, and were. admin-

istered by P professional examin’ersP«

with whom the students were ~not'f,a-L-:
miliar. Furthermore, in “contrast “to

Pitt’s one-arlm .ch'a‘i/rs, ‘each Oxford‘

student had a .separa_t»e table for his
exclusive use. These practacesmay

have been changed or discontinued.
in the twentyfintervenmg ‘years, but P
they were the conditions which pre-

vailed d«u_ri_nlg Dr. James’ att‘endancePZ
In addition to quarterly exa.nuna.-
tions, ‘which P I! e to r m 1 n e (1 his

standing withinthe college, themen

at Oxford are subjected to three ma-

jor examinations} the res onsions, or

entrance examinations, t e modera-
tions at the end of one and a half
years’ work, and the ﬁnals before
graduation. The student’sP standing
and the granting of his degree, were

directly dependent upon the results

of -these examinations. ‘
Those who successfully passed the

ﬁnals were granted degrees, coupled

with honor grades, if they had been

working‘ for honors and if the ex- -

aminers felt that they were closer?-
ing of them. These were granted in

Greek letters: Alpha. Beta, Gamma, a

Delta. The remainder of the stu-
dents were either passed or-failed.
. Students who were unable to take

the ﬁnals due to illness were granted.

the so-called “aegrotat” degrees. As

may be supposed, an unusual ‘preva-

lence of sickness usually makes its
appearance around examination time,
concluded Dr. James.-
