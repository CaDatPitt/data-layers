The Pennsylvania/New York
AIDS Regional Education and
‘Training Center, based _ at the
University of Pittsburgh's Graduate
School of]lkdf Public Health, has
received a two-year grant from the
Bureau of Health Professions of
the Health Resources and Services
Administration.

This $419,000 grant has been
awarded to promote AIDS
educationtamong professionals in
community health a centers and
clinics that provide primary care to

migrant workers.

The grant will supplement the
$2.2 million received by the Center
last fall, and is under the direction
of Monto Ho, M.D., principal
investigator of the grant and
professor of infectious diseases
and-rnicrobiology at Pitt.

The Pennsylvania/New York
AIDS Regional Education and
Training Center provides
multidisciplinary education on HIV
infection and AIDS to primary care
health professionals across
Pennsylvania and New York.

Pitt is the headquarters for this

grant; the $2.2 million grant

awarded last year was shared
with three other AIDS
Education Centers: Columbia
University, which covers the
mid-Hudson valley and New
York City, Philadelphia’s
Hahnemann University Medical
Center, covering eastern
Pennsylvania, and Albany
Medical Center," covering
upstate New York .

“The collaboration between
the centers is very tightly knit,
so the core curriculum of the
program stays the same,” said
Lynne Lytle, BSN, R.N. and
educational coordinator of Pitt’s,

center.

The region covered by the
PA/NY AIDS E.T.C. includes
50 comprehensive community
and migrant health centers,
and 72 satellite clinics. Over
4,300 nurses, physicians, social
workers and allied health
professionals are currently
employed by these centers and
health clinics.

Traditionally, these centers
have been available to
minorities, the poor, families
and individuals for ongoing
and intermittent primary
medical care. The centers are

often the only available agencies to

care for many of the uninsured, and ’

are the only health care providers
other than hospitals who accept
Medicaid patients. Data from the
U.S. Public Health Service indicates
that 602,851 clients were served by
PA/NY AIDS E.'l’.C. in 1988.‘
“Community and migrant health
centers are, for the most part, the
only source of primary health ‘care
for the poor in both urban and rural
areas,” said Linda Frank-I-lertweck-,
co—principal investigator of the
Center. “These centers are seeing
increasing numbers of I‘IIV—infected
people and people with AIDS. As

‘the epidemic continues to grow,

health professionals within these
facilities will need to increase their
expertise in dealing with the medical

and psychological needs of these -

people.”
A . series of AIDS
telecommunications conferences"

began last February at the PA/NY
AIDS E.T.C. at Pitt in cooperation
with Philadelphia’s
Medical Center. They have provided
attending physicians, dentists,
nurses, mid—level practitioners,
technical support staff, social
workers, pastoral counselors a_nd
health ‘care "administrators with
information about the incidence of
HIV infection, and the importance

I of prevention in combating the

spread of the disease. a

The next teleconference to be
held at Pitt’s Learning Research and
Development Center on Nov. 9-10,
“AIDS Train—the—Trainer,”. will train
50 health professionals from all over
Pennsylvania, enabling them to work‘

. Violations halt Panther Hollow lot construction  

 

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer \ —

Suspected violations of several
city building’ ordinances have
temporarily halted the
development of a new 5065-space
parking lot in Panther Hollow.

“There are quite a few items that

_lwe are concerned about in that lot.
’ is isn’t only our departme\nt}_ but

 [it] also involves city sewers, water

lines and fire hydrants," said
Dominick Cimino, assistant
superintendent of the city Bureau
of Building Inspection. _

Last Friday, Cimino hand
delivered a letter to Sol Gross,
owner of Ace Demolition Co. in
North Versailles, informing him
that the land operation» permit to
grade the lot had been revoked.
Gross owns the Panther Hollow
lot and was hoping to open for

business this past weekend.

_ Allegations made against
Gross include exceeding the
limit on dirt removal, failing to
plan an acceptable drainage’
system and not Filing plans
with acceptable city agencies.

Cimino andothercityofficials

imet with 100 residents last

Thursday at a meeting of

Oakland Directions, Inc., a’

coalition of block clubs,

businesses and service groups.
At this meeting, Cimino
pledged that work on the lot
would stop. Complaints
from residents included
accusations from Charles
Haynie, whose home is
adjacent to the project. Haynie
said that Gross broke open a
large septic. tank on his
property while.-working. As a
result, raw sewage has flowed

into a large pond that has formed in A

front of his home from uncontrolled
water runoff from the development,
Haynie said. , ’ -

Cimino said that as soon as Gross»
provesthat the allegations are false

or rectifies the infractions, he will be
permitted to begin work again.

Pitt's other campuse

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

Students at the University of
Pittsburgh in Oakland can
experience city living along with
a campus-life atmosphere.
However, Pitt also has four other
campuses, often called “branch
campuses,” which offer a different
type of college experience with
the same quality of education.

Currently the Greensburg
campus, or UPG, though small in
relation to Oakland’s, has literally
been branching out, with
revitalization projects under way
including new dormitories, sports
facilities and academic programs.

The University of Pittsburgh at
Greensburg, with its current
enrollment of 1,641 students, is
working hard to overcome its
image of “a major university in a
small college setting and a 13th
grade with ashtrays. ” The campus
is in the process of a five-year
development program which
began in 1987.

The program, currently in its
third fiscal year, plans funding

 

 

 

l

for physical renovation and
expansion, as well as for
expansion of the academic
programs.

One of Greensburg’s “campus
of the future” projects involves a
fiber—optic telephone system. The
system houses an underground
networking process where
information flows through all
buildings by copper wire, or fiber
optics, relaying messages from
Greensburg to Oakland.

This fall, Greensburg also has
begun to participate in a video-
lecture system where lectures are
taped live in Oakland and are
received in Greensburg
classrooms. As a two—way
communication system, the
interactive process allows
students in Oakland and
Greensburg to take part in lectures
simultaneously. UPG students
can ask questions or talk to
professorsand the professors can
see them through the video, giving
them direct feedback.

Two months ago, a student
center was completed at UPG.
The center houses sports facilities

which include ‘a weight room, a
track and handball and
racquetball courts. Also, the
center holds the major campus
dining hall, administrative offices,
the placement office and a
recreation room which includes
pool tables and video games.
“This is an all—purpose building

constructed for our students,” said '

Guy Rosetti, dean of
administration at Greensburg.

Greensburg’s old student-

iactivity building has been

converted into a computer center
called McKenna Hall. “All
functions for academic and
administrative computing are
done out of this building,” said
Rosetti.

Robert Shaw Hall, a new 100-
bed co-ed dormitory, was
completed this summer and
began housing students on August
28.

There has also been a 12—acre
outdoor athletic complex
completed which includes
football, baseball and soccer
fields.

have had 167 acres to work with
throughout all of this. Pitt
practically owns the valley,” he
added.

In light of all of Greensburg’s
additions and renovations, a new
maintenance building has also
recently been constructed. .

A major academic goal for
Greensburg has been a four-year
degree program. The first four-
year‘ degree program was
introduced into the curriculum in
1971. Since then, many other
bachelor’s degree programs have
been added, including
administrative justice and
engineering.

“We've been working hard and
diligently,” said Rosetti. “We want
to turn [Greensburg] into a small
liberal arts college, with some
professional programs also.”

Eventually, UPG hopes to add

anxiously awaiting the state

Rosetti said.

Greensburg’s entire renovation
project has cost slightly more
than $19 million. The campus
acquired funds from three
sources: Commonwealth funds,
private foundations and
individuals and the university’s
own money.

es and Misdemeanors

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

Woody Allen’s Crimes and
Misdemeanors is a thrilling’
departure from his previous
works and the iirst real success
in the director’s decade-long
attempt to do something
serious. Emerging from the pit
of rehashed Ingmar Bergman
and Park Avenue neuroses of
his '80s misﬁres, Allen attempts
to reconcile his serious and
comic modes, coming up with
one of the best ﬁlms of his
career.

Crimes tells the stories of
two New York Jews,
connected only through their
acquaintance with a saintly
rabbi who’s going blind (Sam
Waterston). Judah, the rabbi’s
opthamologist, is a graying
patriarch of wealth. and high
standing whose mistress

sniveling, obsessive airline“
stewardess, could send his gilded _

world crumbling down. After
Judah tries to leave her, Dolores
threatens to tell his wife about
their relationship and also
mentions exposing his shady
financial dealings. I
Judah consults two people

about the Dolores problem. The ,_
rabbi urges him to do the virtu ous'. ‘

his marriage and prestige as a

Cl‘iII1€S

Continued from page 6

‘ \“starving children and toxic
waste,” his career is going
nowhere. Meanwhile, his brother-
in—law and nemesis Lester (Alan
Alda) is a smashing success,
writing innocuous sitcoms in
Hollywood and dating a different
starlet every night. Lester is the
subject of an upcoming “Great

A Minds” show on public television,‘

J and as a favor to his sister he asks
Cliff to do the documentary.
Swallowing his pride, Cliff

As Cliff tackles topics like "

accepts.

Of course, this is a classic Allen
set-up: the shallow prima donna
with everything vs. the loser with
nothing but integrity and one-
liners (and the audience’s
sympathy).

Alda’s smart—aleck bray thatwas
so obnoxious on M"A*S*H is
delightful here. Allen has aged,
with mournful eyes and a face
resembling a rumpled pear; he is
truly pathetic — the Little Tramp
as Jewish intellectual.

Cliff competes with Lester for

the affection of the documentary’s
producer (Mia Farrow, who is
good here), while concocting a
malicious documentary (in which
he intersperses Lester’s interviews
with Mussolini footage).

With characteristic ambition,
Allen fills Crimes with plenty of
philosophical discussions,
informing us in no uncertain
terms that it is a study of the
ambiguity of good and evil.
Though Crimes won’t make
anyone forget Dostoevsky, the
ideas do have some potency.

The tale of Judah epitomizes

Reagan Era power, corruption and '

lies the wayfilms like Wall Street
have failed to do. Like '[he
Godfather, Crimes understands
that ruling—class ambivalent
morality is a family affair. More
engaging and less profound, Cliffs

story tackles moral themes the A

way J.D. Salinger might, pitting
the tactless, passionate misfit (Cliff)
against the glib, admired “phony”
(Lester).

As with this summer’s Do the
Right Thing, some critics will scoff

at a (non—foreign) filmmaker who
tries to think, and will point out
the holes in Crimes and
Misdemeanors, ignoring the far
more important fact that this is a
bold attempt to mix ideas and
amusement,“ schtick and
significance.

Crimes is as easy to find fault
with as it is to enjoy— not always
satisfying, but always interesting,
forging a new path just when it
seemed Allen was at the end of
the road.

By Jennifer Davis
Staff Writer

Although George Bernard

 . Shaw’s play Arms and the Man

takes place around 1885 in the
middle of the Bulgarian war, the
University of Pittsburgh Theatre
successfully draws its
contemporary audience into the
realm of old-fashioned love and
war. T

The play begins in young
Raina’s (Sara Jane Fleming)

. bedchamber, which is invaded,
E by a suave captain from the‘

opposing army. Even though she
declares her love to Major Sergius
Saranoff (Dereck R. Walton) of
the Bulgarian army, she finds
herself captivated with Captain
Bluntschli’s (Kenneth Roberts)
charm and realism, and hides

him in her room.

Raina’s mother Catherine
Petkoff (Patricia Miles) and her
servant Louka (Anne Louise
Bannon) also help the captain
elude his enemies by giving him
a cloak to hide his uniform. When
he returns to the field, he meets
Raina’s father, Major Paul Petkoff
(Larry A. Heller) and Sergius.

At this time of truce, he jokingly
tells them the story of how he
escaped from the enemy by

hiding in a young woman’s
. bedchamber. The dramatic irony

is at its best. here, as neither
Sergius nor Major Petkoff realize
that the young woman’s room is

Raina’s. Paul invites Bluntschli,

back to his home, thus setting
the stage for a hilarious game of
hide-and-seek.

Perhaps the best part of this

THE prrr NEWS, Thursday, November 16, i989 Y 2
George Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man

production is the complex love
triangle that is created between
the characters. Sergius and Raina
only want to be together for
reasons of status; in fact, Raina
wants Bluntschli, while Sergius
desires Louka. On the other
hand, the Petkoff's other servant,
Nicola (Ierry Scott), believes that
he and Louka will someday be
wedded.

All of these soap opera—sty1e
love games bring added light and
humor to this production. Under
the direction of‘ Mavourneen
Dwyer, the characters are
distinctly defined, yet very
versatile. “Several of the characters
have to grow up and find out who
they really are during the play,
and growing up is a hard thing to
do,” says Dwyer.

Greeks

Continued from page 4

“getting [alcohol] from the bar

though."

“I really don’t like it,” Jason
Becker of Phi Kappa Theta said.
“It’s good because it does cut
down on underage drinking, but
it hinders us socially. The Greeks
are responsible enough to handle
it the way it was.

“People are going to drink

A anyway. We're a little safer than

an apartment party. Attendance
has really gone down [at our
parties], but it’s getting better.”
One of the main reasons the
fraternities are upset with the
policy stems from the way it was
brought into effect. “It was
decided for us, not by us,” Dave

‘Grimm of Pi Lambda Phi said.
2'3 “We had nothing to say about it.

“It’s more the way it was done,

not that it was done. It’s good for

insurance purposes.”

Many fraternities feel that this
policy has singled them out
among other organizations and
alternative social spots. “I think
it’s unfair,” Hank Compernolle of

Delta Sigma Phi said. “I don’t“

think it’s a bad policy, but it’s
unfair to just [single us out].
“We’ve been here for 75 years,

’f‘yet they're doing nothing about

underage drinking in apartment
parties and even less with people
selling alcohol to kids.”

Fabry said. “It’s a lot different
than before. People are now
speciﬁcally beingtold they can’t
drink and it’s being enforced.”

Guernsey said that almost
everyone has mentioned that
attendance at parties was
declining. “Most of the fraternities
have gone with mixers,” Guernsey
said. “Most of the problems in the
past have been with non-Greeks.
" “[The Greeks] 4 pretty much
watch out for each other and
keep each other in line, but with
someone you don’t really know,

f, you really don’t have that control.”

Author advises early ﬁnancial preparation

By Tammy Richardson
Staff Writer

Life after college can be
stressful, and according to a
local author and publisher,
students should start planning
early for future financial
security.

Dennis Damp, who gave a
free lecture last Tuesday in the
William Pitt Union, offered
practical advice from his new
books, Dollars and Sense, and
the U.S. Government
Employment Guide.

According to Damp, V most
students have no idea of the
stress that comes with
graduation. He said, “ Later on,
when it comes time to buy a
home, take a vacation or retire
with money in the bank, will

all of those things be possible?
One fault of the educational
system today,” he said, “is that it
only teaches [students] the
mechanics of getting a job. It
doesn't teach how to be

This plan enables an individual
to shelter up to 7 percent of their
income from taxes, while
providing a pension for
retirement. -

Damp also recommended

 

successful at that job.”

He pointed out that new
graduates are often faced with
difficult decisions that they are
ill-prepared to make. For
instance, new employees often
have to decide whether or not to
join a company's 401B plan.

' entering a prof1t—sharing program

which allows an employee to
put some of his salary toward
buying company stock. Most new
graduates, he said, don’t know
enough about their options to
make well—informed decisions.
Damp’s advice for new

graduates is to “start looking
ahead now." He suggests that
“you pay yourself first,”
beginning with the first
paycheck. In other words, he
advises that graduates “put
away a little money every
month, even if it’s only $25."
Rather than put those few
dollars into a savings account,
however, he recommended
investing the money in safe,
blue chip stocks. He said, “You
don’t have to be rich to buy
stocks. A little bit of money
every month can really add

up." '

Damp added that, “if you do 4,
nothing else, invest in savings
bonds.” The key to success
and security later in life, he
said, “is discipline and fiscal
responsibility now.” '

~ win. I just can’t see the Chargers

winning two in a row. ‘
Buffalo at New England: The
Pats are the most disappointing
team of the season and the Bills

are still solid. Buffalo.

Detroit at Cincinnati: Detroit
can't win two in a row either.
Kansas City at Cleveland: Marty
returns to the city by the lake. His
Chiefs don’t stand a chance.
Miami at Dallas: Dallas almost
won its second straight last week.
Here comes its second straight
loss.

Minnesota at Philadelphia: N 0
one beats the Viking defense. No
one!

New Orleans at Atlanta: The
Saints will surge over .500 for the
first time this year. The Falcons
will plunge deeper into the

depths.

Tampa Bay at Chicago: I called

the upset last time. No upset this

week. Sorry, Vinny.

Phoenix at LA Rams: Phoenix

needed luck to beat Dallas last

week. Rams by a lot; they have to

keep in the race.

LA Raiders at Houston: Take

the Raiders in a mild upset. ~
Seattle at NY Giants: Let’s go

crazy. Another upset. Take the

Seahawks over” the overrated

Giants.

Green Bay at San Francisco: It

THE PI'IT NEWS, Saturday, November 18, 1989

Week 1 1 of the NFL

.Metcalf will be running circles

around the boys from Arrowhead,
but look for a close one.
Minnesota at Philadelphia:
Vikings’ defense should be all
they need.

Green Bay at San Francisco:
Should be a good one. Green
Bay has been a surprise this
season, but they should be little
trouble for the ‘Niners.

LA Raiders at Houston: Game
of the week. The Oilers are hot
after pulling out that victory over
the Bengals Monday night, so
give them the win this week in
the “House of Pain.”

Phoenix at LA Rams: Upsetlllll
No, just kidding. LA will tear this
team up.

Seattle atNY Giants: The Giants,
after suffering a slight setback
against the Rams last week, will
rebound and blow away the
Hawks.

NY Jets at Indianapolis: Look
for Dickerson to have a good
game, simply because he is due.
The Jets  well, I never pick the
Jets. . ‘
