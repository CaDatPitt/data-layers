Pitt Panthers
Nittany, Lions
‘Clash Tomorrow

Pitt will close its 1943 football
season tomorrow when the Panthers
meet the Lions of Penn State at the
Stadium. The Staters are rated as
two-touchdown favorites to take the
game, but you can be sure that the
team Clark Shaughnessy puts on
the ﬁeld tomorrow will, at least, be
a ﬁghting team.

For the Ohio State game, if you
want to dignify it and callbit that,
showed only too clearly that what
a boy can or ‘should do is not the
important thing. It's what he wants
to do that counts. Evidently, the
only positions that are secure for
Saturday's game are those of the
coaching staff, for the lineup is in
for a severe shake-up.

Francis Mattioli has been ap-
pointed game captain for the third
time, but Shaughnessy is still un-
de'c_ided whether to start him or
Steve Polach in the left "guard pos-

right guard. Jim McDonough is
scheduled to replace Mal Ebert at
left tackle. McDonough, a 210-
pound freshman from Carnegie
who is rated as a pretty "fair tackle,

went during the summer.
ber will hold down the other tackle
spot, and Joe Pierre and Paul Mas-
sey will again team up at ends.

Former R0 TC

Students Return

Last Saturday morning, several
former Pitt ROTC students re-
turned to the University to take
part in the AST program here.

“These 2men were ;members of
the advanced ROTC and are” back
ot study under the AST those
things which will assure develop-
ment along lines ‘of maximum util-
ity to the arm or service to which
they are later assigned}? stated
M. D. Wills, professor of military
science and tactics. _ -

These menwere called to active
duty last June. They were process-
ed at a reception center and then
sent to Fort Eustis,'Virginia, where
they received basic_training in an
anti-aircraft unit. They will be at
Pitt until space becomes’-. available
in Oﬁicers Candidate Schools.‘

Classes will not start until De-
,c_ember 13, - and between now and
then, the men will get a furlough
which twill include. Thanksgiving
weekend. ‘ .

. For the most part, former engin-
eering" students will resume their

drawing, and military science. At

ter at the‘ University, they will be
permitted to take one or two credits
in their ﬁeld and thus work toward
a degree. '

Representatives

Meet , AST Men I

‘To Plan Holiday

if the AST men are off duty‘
Thanksgiving Day, students and 4

families who wish to invite them
to their homes for Thanksgiving
dinner will have the chanceto do
so, Ray Pierotti, E, announced to-
day. All invitations will be accepted
and handled through the company
commander.

.This is a part of the activities
program being planned by civilian
student representatives who meet

weekly in the dean of men’s oﬁice -

with AST delegates. Questions rais-
ed at ESGC meetings are presented
to the servicemen at each meeting.
The men suggested that" for the

Thanksgiving plans, persons ex-.

tending invitations might submit

,,preferences as to-their «guest sol-

diers’- backgrounds, religions, or
nationalities.

The committee also discussed the

possibilities of holding a weekly

“mixer” for the Pitt women and
AST men on Wednesday-evenings.
Fraternity aﬂiliations will be se-
cured from the men and also the
names of those who would like to
attend ‘any fraternity affairs or to
visit‘ at fraternity houses. These
will be submitted to the Interfra—
ternity Council‘ to be used in the
future. '

Plans for athletimactivities, and

a riﬂe team were discussed, and
Army permission for the comple-‘
tion of the committee's plans has

been sought.

The civilian connnittee includes
Ruth Becker, Dorothy Orie, Elea-
nor Smith, Robert Campbell, and
Chairman Ray, Pierotti. Of the
AST men, Runyan and Ward from
Co. A, Chauner and Preuthun of

Co. G, .Willman and Ulrich‘ of Co.,

l

E, and Schultz and Williamsoii of
Co. F are serving on the committee.

‘ l
l
l

A cuses even run to the extreme,

 

Until the quarantine period for
the new Aircrew Squadron C and
the returning junior ROTC boys,
former students here, is lifted, civ-
ilian wolves will have to do their
operating and make it big time.
Aircrew squadrons seem to know
their way around before they come
to Pitt, and the ROTC have had a
three year start, so look out for a
lot of fun in a couple of weeks.

Tom She:-rick, trying to make
better moon faces at Ursla Hal-
loran, has been warned that PiKA

Last week, John Whiteman, bus-

‘  manager of the Pitt News, re-
. peivjed a check for $75 from Lieut.
\ Slesinger who had received a copy
of the se1:vicemen’s edition and
fread of the University’s bond drive.
7 Rather than buy a $100 bond at his

T ,camp, Slesinger sent the check to

‘H Pitt and requested the purchase of

V. . a bond from here.

Hdving entered the service in

ant at Camp Lee, Virginia, and

_v DAVE BARBOUR
Hello Everybody,

I8

VVell, the doubleee department is
still in stitches over the weird ex-
perience it had the other day. . . It
seems that some Woman dropped in
to tell Prof. Dyche that she was
receiving mental messages from the
Japs, etc. . . . She wanted the dou-
bleee gang to ﬁx up a dictogiaph
sort of arrangement whereby she
could record her brain messages in-
stead of having to take notes . . .
and she actualy had a notebook full
of alleged messages from the Japs.
. . . Boy, that was strictly a case for
the men in white.

In keeping with our policy of
giving pertinent advice along the
love line to bewildered engineers,
I’d like to tender the following
little ditty: ’ _

The foal that willingly prove/.-.es a
womom '

H as made himself a.n.oth.er evil cmgel

And a new Hell,

To which all other tormmzts are but
more pastime . 2 .

(Gee, I hope Don Voss doesn't
forget that.)

There’s big things doin’ this
week-end. . . . Of course tonight
there's the big Air Corps(e) dance.
. . . You guys better keep close tab
on your sweeties after that dance
. . . don’t underate the cadets ._ . .
but then there’s no sense in overat-
ing them either. . . . So if you want
to keep your gal in trim, take her
to the Turkey Trot tomorrow -night.
. . . Don’t forget to be there . . .
and if you don’t want to bring a
gal, why come anyway.  . You can
dance with Dody Hurrell all night
. . . I don’t think that’s a bad bar-
gain . . . hmmmm.

The plumbers (alias Chem. E's)
‘had a jolly time this week. . . .
The A. I. Ch.E. met in this fair
city for the first time in 9 years
. . . so all the Chem. E. classes
were cancelled. . . . The seniors
went down to hear them read
some technical papers", and the
rest just loafed. . . . That loaf-
ing gets on your nerves, at least

.....

   

i

that’s what Handsome George
Nahay says, natclxerly.

You may have heard this one be-
fore . . . but I think it’s priceless
. . . John Holmes: “Are you free
tonight?” . . . Tuck Shop Siren:
“No, but I'm inexpensive.” . . . Gee
_vou’re dumb. . . . Think it over a
while . . . it's good. . .;.~ So with
that I’ll wind up another bunch of
tid-bits . . . with the aclmonishment
that you fellas better be at the Tur-
key Trot.”

University of Alabama’s paper,
the Crimson & ‘White, hits the head-
lines with the news that one of the
Alabama co-eds has been chosen as
the typical college girl. Cr.--ed Ge-
nie’ Blue was chosen from several
other girls in the Home Economics
School. The reason the typical lass
was chosen from Alabama U and
not from Pitt or some place else
is becau.-re of th outstanding worlr
done by graduates of the Home

Gallery Exhibits
Drawings

By, Dr. Avinolt

Fifty drawings by Andrey Avi-
nofl’, director of Carnegie Museum
and advisory professor of biology
and ﬁne arts, are now on display in
the Fine Arts "Gallery on the sev-
enth_ﬂoor of the Cathedral. 

These drawingswere ma°de on
week-end excursions -which the
artist has made during the past
few months. The subjects are di-
vided into three groups and in-
clude views of New Hampshire,
Williamsburg, and Rolling Rock.

Mr. Walter Read Hovey, head of
the ﬁne arts department, has given
these comments, “The technique of
these drawings, like so much of Dr.
Avinoif’s work,- ' is extraordinary.
The style was inspired by onethat
was popular with Fragonard in the
eighteenth century. Ordinary wax
crayon, similar to that used to mark
china in stores, is used on the tinted
paper to produce these interesting
results,” Mr: Hovey continued. “The
paper itself, not the crayon, gives
the richness, the depth, the sun-
light, and the shadow to the draw-.
ings. " ‘

The public is invited to come into
the Fine Arts Gallery on the seventh

- ﬂoor of the aCthedral to see these

drawings. The exhibit, which is open
daily from 9 to 5_o’clock, and on
Saturdays_from 9' to 1 o’clock, will
continue through November’. ' '

Oh what a. cheerful announce-

ment——that our furlough (or rather '
vacation while we’re in school) has
been set at ﬁve days instead of
seven; naturally all the plane res-
ervations have been gone since then.
However, we must get our books,
and if the only way to get them is

to shorten our vacation, why cut it 4
as much as necessary. Boy, do we .- '

We got word from Marion.
‘ Sams in F company that he’s not,
so sure his gals here are going to ’
let him out of their sight long
enough to get home, and after _all

he couldn’t disappoint so many of " 

them. It’s rather imperative

though, that he get home to his.'i';{’

way for him to save money—-as ag -; ‘_

The dance given by the coeds

 ‘There has been a steady westward movement——westward
in the direction of Missouri——ever since the Ohio State game,
fﬁﬂ’ people are no longer inclined .to give the Panthers anything.
They want to be shown. Pitt was generally _expected to sur-
firise against, Ohio State, but no one quite expected a shock
like that. P '

 The Panthers still -owe‘ their coaches and their student
 body an explanation; forthe _game, but it‘ is an explanation
I  thatvcould be given in no better form than that of a complete
igeversal of form against Penn State tomorrow. ~-»

, »  The Pitts do have a chance to defeat the Lions. Once again
they have been given an excellent scouting report. They have
been given an offense and a defensethat can stop the Lions.
But" no one can give them the spirit, or the will to win. That

must come from the team itself.

  . Right now, this is the game that means the most to every-
, one. A win will.‘ give the Panthers a four and four record and
 ' the'1943 season could be laid away labeled a “success.” And the
' Panthers couldn’t ﬁnd a nicer way of vindicating themselves
Ltlian by defeating Penn State, for this is the one natural
1'_ivalry‘left on the Pitt schedule, since the Pitt-Duquesne-Tech
city, series fell apart. And a Penn State win always has been
‘worth, two of any other kind._ ,

‘ Tomorrowfs ball" game belongs,‘ to the Panthers. What

before, be a nice one to win. , ‘ ~ ., - ‘ g »

, Considering the trend of recent‘ Pitt-Ohio, State games
‘I’-59-19 last year, 46‘-6 this year) it, might be_ a good idea if
éfnture games were conducted" along the lines of the ‘track-
’ ﬂeet between Pitt. and Army_ at Army two years ago.

The weather was bad, the track was muddy, and Pitt did’
not wish to stay over. ‘So Pitt Coach Carl Olson and Army
' ‘Coach Neal Novak got together and decided to ﬁgure? the
-Jdieet out logically. Thus, if the. Pitt relay team had beaten
:P‘en.n‘State with a time of 3:04 and Army had been beaten
with a time of _4 :02 the event was chalked up to Pitt. Or, if a
fceitain Army player was known to run the hundred in 9 :8 and

‘to’ Army. In the case of close decisions or ties, they tossed a
coin. . - '
, As we recall, Pitt eventually lost by a 75-52 score, but
everyone was satisﬁed. i - v V '

, We are deﬁnitely intrigued with the idea of. howmuch
= ,_ etter things would have been had Pitt employed this system

 downs betterthan Pitt. This would have made the final score
-- .28-14, and we know everyone would have been a lot happier.

Quintet 62-41  

By HUGH CHAVERN

Doc Carlson”s “Little Toughies”
proved their toughness Wednesday
afternoon in a practice game, win-

ning over a scrappy team composed

of students and an instructor of the
University’s School of Medicine. The
ﬁnal score was 62-41 in the Pan-
tlier’s favor, which came after four
quarters of hard-fought and hard-
wrestled basketball.

Only six varsity players were
used during the entire game, indi-
vidual scores ‘ranging from four
points to twenty. Nate Appel, Tom
Regan, Ken Vey, Walt Zernich, and
Bill Cieply started the game, with
J. W. Glenn alternating with Re-
gan. Cieply led the individual
scorers with .20 points, followed by
Walt Zernich with-15, Appel with
11, Regan scoring 6._ _Glen_n, ham-
pered with a leg injury, tallied two
ﬁelid goals for a total of four points.

The medical school team used all
ten of its players, starting _Fran'k
Lally, McRea, 'Ma'ginnity, Tim Ka-
ble, and Dr. Ruhe. Substitutes were
Steve Zernich, varsity performer of
last year and brother of Walt Zer-
nich, Murray Simms, John’ Weber,
W. C‘. Kinsey, and Mendel “Red”
Silverman, also a varsity star while
an undergraduate atthe Univer-
sity. McRea ‘was the high individ-

1 f th M d d I
ua scorer or e e s, an began Ay.e‘a1_‘,S fogtban team’ ‘is currently

his personal attack with four ﬁeld
goals in the ﬁrst quarter.’ Kinsey,
Kable,'McRea, Silverman, and Zer-

fnich are" part of ‘the Army AST

Company C stationed here; Simms
and Weberare in the Navy pro-
gram; Lally and Maginnity are in-
ternes at local hospitals;- Dr. Rube
teaches -- at the School of Medicine.

The end of the ﬁrst quarter
showed the Panther on the short
end of a 13-8 count,-and it took Ap-
pel, Zero-ich, Vey Cieply, and Glenn
to score a «total of eleven ﬁeld goals
in’ the second period to lead 23-30
at half time. Doc’s boys were still

ahead 44-33 at the third quarter

and ﬁnished strong with the score
of 62-41.

Tonight the varsity meets Her-
ron YMCA in a practice game be-

. ginning at 7:8/0. . i

last game for Pitt tomororw

straight _wins against the Lions.
The State win in -1939 was their
first in 20 years, and in 1940 ‘Pitt
was responsible for the only loss
-on the Nittany record. But .in the
past two years,‘ things have been
pretty much as Penn State wanted
them. Pitt played its best game of
the year against the Lions last sea-
son‘ but still came away on the
short end of the 14-6 score.’

It was the 1919 game that be-
came a football legend. For, in the
ﬁrst quarter Pitt carried the ball to
the State ﬁve-yard. line. but the line
held, and Pitt lost ire ball on downs.

Expecting a kick at this stage of"

the game, the Panther backs closed
in. , Instead, Harold Hess dropped
back of goal line and passed to Bob
Higgins on the ﬁfteen. The present
Penn State coach then ran the re-
maining 85 yards for aetouchdown.
That took the heart out of Pop-
Warnei-’s' boys, and Pitt lost, 20-0.

Editor’s Note: This is another article in the series about University
organizations and their wartime policies. This week we introduce you
jto/the Young Men’s Christian Association on campus.

‘The outstanding change in the
YMCA program this year,” said
President Ned McIntosh, “is the

shift of emphasis from student ac-

tivities to military activities.”

Due to the decline of civilian
membership from 417 to approxi-
mately 100, it is natural that the
YMCA should concentrate on mak-
ing the thousands of Army trainees
feel at home at Pitt.

' With their higher triangular pur-
pose in mind, the Y-provides night-
ly programs for the soldiers in-
cluding movies, symphonies, swing
