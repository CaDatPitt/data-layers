Varied Lecture Topics

Theme of this year’s Religious

tation will be foremost in the dis-
cussions next week, but lectures on
other current problems will be giv-
en full consideration by the guest
speakers.

Campus Conference is not con-
ﬁned to members of any single re-
ligious group or to students of one
particular school, states Dr. S. P.
Franklin, professor of religious ed-
ucation and local chairman. The

program has been designed to meet,

the needs of the entire University.

Approximately 30 meetings and
services have been arranged by YlV[-

gree from Princeton university he
spent two years as assistant profes-
sor of philosophy at his alma mater.

Dr. Mann is rabbi of Sinai con-

Retail Bureau Publishes. Book,

‘Customer Complaint Calendar’

Do you suffer from wrong—chan-
gomania?

Did your 0. a. 0. look uncomfort-
able in a size 14% shirt when you

send him a size 15? If you are the
victim of these or similar circum-
stances, you will appreciate the
“Customer. Complaint Calendar,” a

"book of 232 pages by William J.

Pilat, professor of retailing.

The analysis was published as a
result of investigation by the Uni-
versity’s Research Bureau for Retail
Training, which shows that within
one year, 811.187 custom complaints
were received by 21 different de-
partment stores in various sections
of the country.

The average store, according to
the investigation, has three com-

__ plaints for every 100 sales.
Among major causes for com- '

'7

plaints, according to Mr. Pilat, are:
overselling advertised items; shod-
dy, incorrectly sized, poor quality or
unsatisfactory merchandise; salary
expense reduction beyond the point
of efficient working force and su-
pervision; carelessness and inade-
quate systems, equipinent, and ma-
terials.

From a customer’s point of view,
typical complaints arise from the
following: non’-deliveries, poor or
unsatisfactory qual.ity, credit claims
or refunds, damage, wrong mer-
chandise, poor service, and short-
ages.

Only about half of allvthe com-
plaints result in return of ‘merchan-
dise, Mr. Pilat says. Compaint-re-
turns, he adds, are probably the
kind that stores can eliminate. be-
cause, for the most part, stores
cause them.

Comment* on FPC Plan

Student opinion on the FPC edict
was as varied as it was verbose.

Excerpts follow:
Jack Hoeveler, C40, vice president
of Student Faculty Association and
Independent Party leader:

>'“In general it is a step in the
right direction toward merit. Dean
Amos may be right in trying to ac-
complish this end by divorcing poli-
tics from the sororities but the In-
dependents have found that good
candidates can only be elected by
organization. The move leaves the
sorority women at a distinct disad-
vantage.”

Wilson Reveals Council’s Request

To Refrain From Campus Tie-Ups

An announcemeiit this week by Helen VVils0n, C40, presid.ent=

of thc—women’s Fraternity Presidents’ Council, that a large majority
of campus sororities have “voluntarily agreed” to abandon-‘po1i-
tics this year created a furore in student political circles.

The “clean politics” move—-explained as “absolutely S‘t11¢3lel1lS"‘

promptec” by Miss Wilson-——broke last Monday evening when six-

teen won1en’s fraternities were asked by letter by the FPC to.
as a group from any formal or informal political.

“refrain . . .

set-up or agreement” in any campus organizations whatsoever.

A A complete official report of the voting by the fraternities was not
released by FPC or the office of the dean of women. Miss Wilson stated

that she was pledged to secrecy by the FPC until “complete returns were‘

available.”

An unofl‘ici.al tabulation made by the Pitt News discloses that twelve!‘

fraternities endorsed the motion with four lined up on the negative side.
Those favoring the motion included Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Epsilon

Phi, Beta Kappa Alpha, Beta Sigma Omicron, Chi Omega, Delta Delt_a_~

Delta, Delta Phi Epsilon, Delta Zeta, Phi Mu, and Zeta Tau Alpha.

“We feel it is in the best inter-

should be tied down to block vot-

a sudden-it’s just. that the time
was right this week.”

Priscilla Vl/elday, C40, president,
Kappa,Kappa Gamma:

“The chapter feels that the ideas
behind the proposed reform are
good, but they are not convinced
that in a University of this size and

Greek Group Prepares
Marble for Shipment

Marble for the University’s Greek classroom has been shipped from
Greece according to Nicholas Kalmer, local chairman of the room com-

mittee.

A cable received. from Michael Rodas in Athens says:

“The Athens

committee of the University of Pittsburgh has received the marble destined

for the Greek room, which after be-
ing packed will be shipped to the
United States at the first oppor-
tunity.”

Mr. Rodas, head of the newspaper
guild in Greece and a correspondent
of the Greek National Herald in
New York, is assisted in Athens by
John Anastasopoulos of the Bank
of Greece, and Sprios Theodore-
pousos, a lawyer.

The local Greek room committee
sent money to Greece to purchase
the ﬁnest marble. A gift of 150,000
drachmae, or $1,200, was made to
the University by the Greek gov-
ernment to fabricate the marble.
Mastoris, most famous marble cutter
of Greece who cut the stone for the
Gennadeios library, was commis-
sioned for the job.

Shipment of the marble will be
made sometime this month on a
Greek steamer. The marble is of
two kinds: white Pentellic for the

columns, and grey Kokinara for the

ﬂoor and wainscoting.

Furniture for the Greek room, one
of the 17 nationality classrooms on
the first floor of the Cathedral, is
ready. It is of carved white oak
trimmed with gold and with inlay
of black ebony. ' '

fourth anniversary on the Univer-
sity campus, with a banquet in the
College club on Tuesday.

Reporting opposing the measure:

were Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa

Kappa Gamma, Phi Sigma Sigina,

and Theta Phi Alpha. ' '

Alpha Kappa Alpha has made no-.
report when the Pitt News survey
was made.

‘Democratic Ideal’

The unprecedented request, which
threatens to split the campus polit-
ical picture wide open, provoked a.
flood of comment. Patrick Cusick,
C40, president of Student—Faculty
Association, declared that the “clean.
politics” covenant would prove to
be a boomerang to the plan. “Sorori-
ties will resort to underhand poli-

tics which Dean Amos doesn’t want .

them to do,” he declared Wednes-
day.

Many fraternity women, however,
expressed their conﬁdence in the
success of the movement. In a for-
mal declaration of their motive, the’
fraternity presidents’ group warned
sororities Monday that “to preserve

. . dignity of the fraternity . . .
every fraternity member should
stand on her own merit in other
group relationships, receiving
neither support nor opposition be-
cause she is a fraternity woman.”

“The world situation,” the state-
ment continued, “challenges us as
selected groups of college women
to learn, to practice, and to pass on
enriched to our successors, the dem-
ocratic ideal . . . It becomes harm-
ful when any fraternity places its
own good above that of the whole
or when fraternity competition is‘
carried into other types of group life
on campus.”

‘Hitlerism at University’

Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant
dean of women, was enthusiastic in
her approval of the “clean politics"
measure, which she endorses “ﬁrm-
ly, frankly, and one hundred per
cent!” Politics and block voting
she declared emphatically, “have
constituted a strangle hold on the
fraternity, a strangle hold on the in-
dividual. Block voting is Hitlerism
brought to the University; it is ab;
solutely foreign to the ideals
aims of modern education.”

Neither Miss Rush nor Miss Wilson
would reveal, however, the ofﬁcial
vote either by houses or by individ-
ual members. It was explained that
the sororities that failed to endorse
the move or expected to swing into
line when the “profitable features"
of such action become apparent.‘ ”
. According to the plans of the
FPC, the move toward political free-
dom among the sororities involves
simply a “voluntary agre’e’r'ne‘nt.,” It
was further agreed, spokesmen for
the group ;evealed, that the meas.
tire was to receive no “publicity”
until approved by two-thirds of the
womcn’s fraternities. » .

. ‘No Alignment’

The two-thirds approval was
reached Wednesday, when only a

believe withouta loub"t that it will
be successful,” Miss Wilson conﬁd-

she declared “is the keynote under
ae new agreement.” ,

And if the “clean—up” was entire-

declared that “no one else (than
FPC) had anything to do with it at
,all. We believe that sororities have

can ‘W’omen Reform
Campus, Politics ?

A minor revolution in student politics faces
the Pitt campus. If the proposal submitted to
women’s frateriiities Monday by Fraternity Pres-
ident’s Council becomes effective,
women will be forced to abandon open participa-
tion in campus politics.

Vv'()111e1‘1 fraternities have been asked to re-
frain from entering into any type of political agree-
ment. This proposal, appa 1"-,€I1tl_V suggested in
good faith by Fraternity President’s Council, is
intended to prevent won1en’s fraternities from par-
tiicipation as organized groups in campus elec-
tions, and particularly to keep the names of frater-
nity women off the slates iii the spring elections
to Student-Faculty Association.

Keeping women’s fraternities out of politics
may be a worthy, idealistic aim. This plan might
assure that women candidates would be voted on
as individuals, not as fraternity members.

But the proposal ignores the cold, hard facts
of politics on the Pitt campus. The SFA election
system makes the presence of political parties in-
evitable. A proposal of this type wil.l not prevent
members of the stronger women ’s fraternities from
running for oﬂice. And no student can be elected
to SEA without organized support.

If this proposal goes into effect it will not
keep womJen’s fraternities out of campus politics.
It will merely force the political alliances under-
ground. The result, as SFA president Pat Cusick
has pointed out‘, will be dirtier politics.

The News seriously questions whether this pro-
posal will accomplish the result for which it is in-
tended. The evil effects of the secret dealings
which this proposal is bound to engender will far
outway the “disadvantages” of fraternity
Women’s participation in campus politics.

A Credit Line
For Mr. Graham

It’s about time that we give some credit where
credit is due. For a while now the thesis that
many of the troubles of the University have been
due to bad publicity has ben propounded by al-
most everyone——-students, faculty and administra-
tion. It has almost become a trite saying, an ex-
cuse for everything. Yet, it is not altogther true,
not by a long shot. ,

The credit for the fact that we do get good
publicity belongs almost entirely to one man, Rob-
ert X. Graham.‘ Through his efforts as director
ofthe University News Service, a steady stream of
stories and pictures telling about the good and

i1n.po'rtant things happening here at Pitt goes out

to publications all over the country.

From Texas to Minnesota, from Maine to Cal-
ifornia, and even in ‘foreign countries material on
Pitt students and the Pitt faculty are printed in
11e\v.~:p:i}3e1"s and niagazines. This is not the windy
oratcrical ﬂourish that it might seem, for many
are the people here at the University who have dis-
covered so1'netl1.ing about themselves in some small
weekly in the south, or under a wire service’s
dateline in some New England daily.

If you wondered how the hometown paper knew
you were leading the prom, or how it know that
you were initiated into that honorary the day after
it happened, it was the News Service that sent the
information. Stories about new discoveries, un-
usual experiences, the latest book at Pitt all come
from “Bob” Graham’s typewriter.

Scarcely a day passes that all. three of those
blasphemoiis local papers, who are nevel‘ supposed
to say anything nice about this school, don’t print
articles on it or its membrers, ranging from notices
of meetings to features on the latest ﬁnding by a
University reseaircher-—ancl they come from the
News service.

I The News itself has received immeasurable aid
from Mr. Graham. Most all of our pictures come
from him, as well as innumerable stories and ideas
for news articles. And at exam time when there is
little news and fewer people to write it, he has al-
ways been a rock of strength who could squeeze
out anothier article or two to help us get the best
coverage. C

Many of the University graduates, and there
are many, who are in journalism are there because
of his direct or indirect aid.

Yes, it’s about time we give credit where
credit is due. Robert X. Graham and the Univer-
sity News Service have done something to deserve
it.

List Tuck Shop Dope

By Frank and Joe  ,

Still a little punchy from the drubbing we received
from the recent exams we stagger out for the last
round and make the following observations . . ; Those
happy looking young men around campus are the foot-
ball players who have just received their new varsity
jackets . It is rumored that Ernie Bonelli even
wears his to bed.

We wond.er if Freshman Ruth Yardumian’s recent
interest in Ernie is because of his new varsity letter—-
or is it because of his sparkling personality . . . Quite
a few of the Freshman girls seem to have been more
interested in the boys than in their studies. As a re-
sult, many of them were ineligible to join fraternities
because of their marks.

Aside to Economics Prof. John Ferguson: If you
haven’t any girl to teach you how to do the “Doggiei”
yet, pretty Thelma Nathan offers her services. Some
guys have all the luck . . . Betty Crowe of the ZTA’s
is scheduled to lead Tech’s Junior Prom tonight with
Bob Deans of the Tech PiKA’s . . .

Law in the Tuck Shop

The law school boys are making quite a big im-
pression on the Tuck Shop girls these days. They"
should come down more often . . . That sparkle in the
eyes of Dot Colvin is there because of the beautiful
engagement ring given her recently as a birthday pres-
ent by Bill Spotz, a last year’s grad . . One of the
most popular freshman girls on campus these days is
Betty Jane Kim. She certainly gets around . . .

All visitors and rushees at the Delt house are
treated to a peek at Bob Bentley’s “Petty Room”-—
twelve framed Petty pictures adorn the walls and tis
rumored that the Delts use this room to talk turkey to
rushees . . Frank Goodell has started on his own
collection of Petty femmes in his corner of the Phi
Kappa wigwam did somebody say Petty is
passe? . .

We hear that Tri-De].t Janie Cleaver is beck in cir-
culation again . Shades of Diamond Jim Brady!

. That dazzling cameo ring sported by Big Chief

Kish daily in the Tuck Shop was presented to him by
the home town folks back in Tonawanda, New York . . .

Narrow Escape

We almost passed out from fright when we heard
how close we came to losing six of our lovliest girls
here at Pitt. It seems that the car in which Mary Lou
Perring, Jane Spencer, Jane and Eleanor Epping, Ginny
Sutherland, and Jeanne Geib were coming to school
in on Wednesday skidded on the icy street and almost
turned over. Please be careful girls . . One of the
big reasons why the girls are so happy lately is be-
cause Dlick‘Fullerton has returned to school after a
near fatal accident . .

We thought that the Phys Ed Majors were a hardy
bunch of muscle builders but it seems that they are
just a bunch of softies. They take a few easy dancing
lessons from Jose Limon and now they are so stiff
they can hardly move around .

The next time Jack Hoeveler and Dick Page en-
 in any ﬁsticuifs they will pick on some fellows
their own size instead of the gorillas they ‘tangled with
last week . . “Dandy Dick” spent the mid-semester
vacation at his home in Albany, N. Y., while Gus Wilde
made a return trip to Florida. We’ll bet he did.n’t go
deep sea fishing this time .

Heat Boxes Become

N ew Pain-killers

By Mary Olive Baker

Conventions pour out pretty amazing things these
davs. Not the least of which is a new doctrine for re-
pairing athletes, news of which comes straight from
the caucus rooms of the American Society of Heating
and Ventilating Engineers.

 

This is the result of research on the subject of mus-
cles being done by Dr. Murray Ferderber, research
fellow in industrial hygiene in the School of Medicine
and F. C. Houghton, the research director of the
ASHVE (the ventilating people).

The good doctor and engineer believe they can take
an athlete or others suffering from physical exertion
brought on by muscular boogie-woogie and rid him of

that awful thing quickly, painlessly and without beneﬁt

of surgery. But if you need 100 per cent rehabilitation,
withdraw your bid for help; you should have known
better in the first place.

All this is done with a variety of canned heat, unﬁt
for drinking purposes, deﬁnitely. The research fel-
lows have built a machine along the lines of cure by
heat. It is called a machine to produce saturated heat,
and if that puzzles you, well, try an experiment of
your own. Take a bath towel, soak itzin good’ hot boil-
ing water, look at it, and tell your closest neighbor, “I
am making saturated heat.” Don’t emphasize the word
"'saturated;” some neighbors might get the wrong im-
pression.

This saturated heat machine is not a commercial
vehicle. However the research workers will build one
of these machines for a nominal sum, if that machine
will be used for furthering the work of reconditioning
athletes and industrial workers. This research busi-
ness has been going on now for about two and a half
years.

The idea behind the machine is to ‘restore an ath-
lete to active duty in a comparatively few hours after
the misbehaving muscles have shrieked for treatment.
Saturated heat can be brewed up pretty quickly if-the
athlete gives audible vent to his discomfort pronto, but
if he is stubborn the method of heat cure takes con-
siderable time to mend sprains.

There-are only 20 of these heat machines in exist-
ence and only 262 patients have been used to test the
things. They are athletes who suffered from muscular
ailments including professional ball players, golfers,
and basketball players, but ethics compels our with-
holding their names. I

One of the principal researchers along this line is
Dr. J. Huber Wagner, and industrial surgeon in the
Pittsburgh district, who was an All-American football
player.

Baseball Team to Engage in 13 Contests

To Seek Victories

In Road Engagements
By Ben Foote

After an inauspicious start in
last week-end’s Millrose games,
coach Carl Olson’s indoor track
stars continue their swing
aroimd the Eastern seaboard to-
night and tomorrow night at
Philadelphia and Boston, respec-
tively.

Tonight Frank Ohl goes to the
boards with a classy ﬁeld of quar-
ter—rnilers in the Penn A C games,
and the mile relay team vies for
the state title with Temple and
Penn State. Al
Ferrara, Hap
Stickel, Al Mc-
Kee, and Bud
Graf are slated
to handle the
baton passing
and striding du-
ties.

Panthers Lose

To Waynesburg

After a slow first half, the
Waynesburg Yellowjackets turned
on the heat and handed the Jungle
Cats their initial home defeat of
the year’, Wednesday night, 41-28.

The anticipated scoring duel be-
tween Bob Simmers and Eddie
Straloski‘ failed to materialize in
the manner expected although the
two sharpshooters did connect for
12 and 10 points respectively to
top all other individual perform-
ers.

Beyer, Wolfpack guard, dropped
six successful charity tosses
through the net and one two-point-
er to take third in the scoring
fhonors. His only field goal put
Waynesburg back in the lead after
an early second half Panther rally
‘knotted the score.

“Red” Port and Brady, the in-
vaders’ sub-guard, waged a short
scoring battle immediately after the
opening of the ﬁnal canto, each
dropping in two field goals in less
than a minute and a half.

Tomorrow the Panthers travel to
Annapolis to meet a weak midship—
man team on Navy’s floor.

Jerks-= Pitt Club, llnbeaten Independent

Rivals, Matched in League Competition

‘Today’s intramural scheduling
throws together two undefeated
ﬁves in the independent ranks. The
Jerks, with a total of four wins,
face the Pitt Club, whose victories
also total four, this afternoon at 5
o’clock..

Power will be on the side of the
Jerks with their aggregation of foot-
ballers, sparked by letterman Ernie
Bonelli, four decisive wins, and a
less rugged opposition.

Bonelli’s four confederates this
evening will probably be Marty
Vardaro, Bob Malloy, Vince Anania,
Jack Stetler and
Walt Wascowitz should put in their
respective appearances during the

‘course of the game.

’ 5All hopes for victory for the Pitt

Club are strung on the scoring
ability of Paul Ruskin and the yap-
ping ability of Al Norbut. Ruskin
cut loose in a game last year and
scored 56 points; so far this season
he has been carrying his team along-
the winning road with his con-
sistent good play.

Norbut has been known. to use his
vocal chords to best advantage in
past contests and ought to be a su.re
thing tonight. Low built Eddie Bur-
ton, John Chaﬁo, and Paul Becker
will ﬁll out the remainder of the Pitt
Club line-up.

Another undefeated basketball
team, the Newman club, is sched-
uled for action today against a team
far down the ranks in standings, the
College Hicks.

Pitt S plashers
To Face State,
Michigan Stars

Splashes are plentiful this week
at the pool in Trees Gym as Coach
Ben Grady puts his swimming team
through ﬁnal paces for their meets
with the Penn State Lions and the
invincible Wolverines from the
University of Michigan.

Pitt plays host to the Penn State
swimmers tonight at the Metropol-
itan pool. Immediately after the
ﬁnal event is completed, the entire
Panther aggregation will “shuffle
off to Buﬁalo” where they are
scheduled to compete with the
Michigan mermen tomorrow eve-
rung.

Pitt has a distinct advantage over

Penn State in having a better bal-V

anced team, although McGlaughlin.'
the Lions outstanding diver, is ex-
pected to offer plenty of competi-
tion for Dick Ames and Joe Kaule
the local squad.

The old, old story of pupil versus
teacher will once again occur when
Grady leads his Panthers against
the Ann Arbor boys. Grady earned
himself quite a reputation as a div-
ing champion under the tutilage of
his former coach Matt Mann, during
his college days at the University of
Michigan.

That Coach Mann can produce
champions is seen by his enviable
record of six successive National
Collegiate championships. His team
is well on their way to their sev-
enth championship with victories
against both Ohio State and Yale
so far this season.

New Schedule Includes
Five New Opponents,
Quintet of Holdovers

Thirteen games are carded this
spring for Pitt’s baseball team,

as contrasted with last year’s

schedule of eleven battles, ac-
cording .to athletic publicity di-
rector Frank Carver.

This year’s Panther diamond ag-
gregation open the campaign with a
swing through the Southland. The
Jungle Cats tackle Duke at Durham,
N. C., in the lid-lifter on April 1.

On April 3 Pitt tangles with Wake
Forest at Wake Forest, N. C., and
the University of Virginia is host to
the Panthers on the following day at
University, Va. The Pitt team en-
counters Maryland at College Park,
Md., on April 6 to conclude the
southern tour.

Indiana State Teachers provide
the opposition for the Panthers
when they begin a home stay on
April 27. Aft-er meeting the Teach-
ers on the Stadium diamond, the
Blue-and-Gold nine plays West
Virginia’s Mountaineers on May 3
and 4. A single engagement, this
one with Penn State on May 11, con-
cludes the home schedule.

Navy’s diamondmen engage Pitt
at Annapolis, Md., a week after the
State battle, and on May 25, Pitt
meets Army at West Point, N. Y.
The Panthers shift‘ the scene of their
operations closer to home on May
31 and June 1, when they tackle
West Virginia again at Morgantown,
W. Va.

A week later the Panthers ﬁnish
the season at State College, Pa.,
against Penn State.

Duke, West Virginia, Penn State,
and Indiana State Teachers are
holdovers from last year on the
schedule. Wake Forest, Virginia,
Maryland, Navy, and Army are new
opponents on the card.

RegistrarlAnnounces Thiéssens Win
Enrollment Increase

Quick Releases
Latest Individual
School Figures

Registration ﬁgures for _ the
second semester in the Univer-
sity’s non-professional schools
total 6,854, an increase of 69
over last year’s ﬁgure of a com-
parable date, J. G. Quick, 1'68"-
istrar, announced. The professional
schools have a combined enrollment
of 872 students.

“Ths second semester rating,”
Quick emphasized, “is not to be con-
fused with the ﬁnal net ﬁgures in-
cluding all students i.n the Univer-
sity from July 1 to the following
June 30.” The ﬁscal year 1938-39,
he pointed out, had a student body
of 14,239. '

Seventy-seven freshmen and 144
new undergraduates have been ad-
mitted to the University this se-
mester.

Leading the registration, the late
afternoon, evening, and Saturday
division signed 2,381 students, and
was trailed by the College with an
enrollment of 1,651.

The G-raduate School has a body
of 771 students; the School of En-
gineering follows next with 612,
while the School of Business Ad-
ministration trails closely with 596.

The Schools of Education, Mines,
Applied Social Sciences, Nursing,
and Retail Training have the fol-
lowing number of students, respec-
ively: 433, 220, 104, 62, and 24.

In the professional schoo-l.s, Medi-
cine leads with 265 students and is
followed by Dentistry with 228.

The two other professional
schools, Pharmacy and Law, have
221 and 158 students, respectively.

The registrar said that it must be
remembered that these figures are
only a small part of the University’s
total net enrollment. 1,309 students
are enrolled in extension courses
outside of the city.

Taken into account, Quick ex-
plained, are those students who are
enrolled in more than one of the
University’s divisions. Thus the net
total contains no duplication of stu-
dents.

with the proponents in seeking the
