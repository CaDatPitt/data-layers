At 10:00 A.M. on Friday,

. March 5, on the Liberty Ave.
side of the Federal Building,
downtown Pittsburgh, there
willbe a pressconference with
lay people, nuns, priests and
ministers who support those
who have not registered with
the Selective Service. Coffee and
pastrieswill be provided. There
will be a public signing of a
statement of support for non-
registrants. This statement will
be mailed to Mr. Turnage, head
of Selective Service in Washing-
ton, D.C. The statement reads
as follows:

~_ ‘ _‘;"Our Christian faith has led
"us to believe that it is wrong to
kill. We support those who
have not registered as anact of
conscientious objection to war,
‘and we encourage others to do
the same. War is unthinkable
especially given the ever-
increasing potential for a
nuclear disaster.”

Commuter
Statement

The Commuter Affairs Com-
mittee would like to express its
opposition to the recent action
by the Burger Chef establish-
ggent in the Cathedral of Learn-

 fg prohibiting people from

bringing food in C from the
outside. '
Because the Burger Chef is on
University property, and is gen-
erally considered a central meet-
ing place for both students and
faculty, we feel that its doors
should remain open to all peo-

sity. In addition, we feel that
this action is particularly
unjust and discriminatory
against commuting students,
who essentially have nowhere
to eat a brown bag lunch.

 . The Commuter Affairs Coin-
V  i>}§("tt‘ urges Burger (lhef to res-
‘ctfid its policy decision. We feel
that until the University can
find a place for commuters to
eat their lunches, brown-
baggers should be allowed to

Health Feelncrease Proposed A

By LAURIE Macteoo

The Student Government Board
is working on a plan to lower the
proposed 43 percent increase in the
student health fee for the fall.

The proposal was announced by
the Student Health Service (SHS)
director Franklin Carter at the Stu-

dent Advisory Board meeting Feb.‘

22.

SGB member Chip Roth said he
believes SGB can have an impact
on this increase and students
should have more input on the
issue since they are paying the fee.

The fee is recommended to
increase from $21 to $30 which
includes student services, salaries
for 24 full-time and 14 part-time
staff members, lab contracts and

mailing services, according to
Carter.
Roth said the -39 increase

wouldn't singly hurt financially
but will add t.o other burdens of
higher education.

Carter sa id the cost is an estimate
for running the health service in
1983 and fiscal year 1984. This
includes an estimated 9.5 percent
increase in spending each year.

Reasons for the recommended
health fee increase are because the
health care costs increase faster

than other segments of the econ- ‘

oiny and to retain the high health
care professionals they must pro-
vide coinpetative salaries, accord-
ing to Carter.

He said no new programs are
planned with the increase but “stu-
dents will continue to get the high
quality health care we believe we
provide.”

Carter said if additional space
were available they would provide
more services ‘and work more effi-
ciently. However more money
would be needed for renovation.

SGB is disturbed because such a
large increase emails no improve-

ments. but presently are in no posi-
tion to make a new proposal or
alternative budget, according to
Roth. 7 _
Carter said the $180,000 surplus
is recommended because i of
increased expenses but this surplus

it arried over to the 1983-84 aca-
demic year.

9 He said the surplus appears large
the first year but is carried over to
the second year. This is “stair-
stepping” the health fee which is

Retention Committee Studies
WhySomeStudentsQuitSchool

By MARGARET ATWOOD

Ten to 15 percent of the total
Pitt student body‘ leaves or
drops out yearly often because
of avoidable confusion. over
bureaucratic procedures and
administrative red tape.

The university’s annual
drop-out rate is higher than
other universities. with 3,500 to
4,000 students dropping out of
all schools (College of General
Science [CGS], College of Arts
and Science [CAS], graduate
‘schools, etc.). At CAS, with the
student body numbering 7-
8,000, last year 1,490 seemed to
drop—out, said Bob Firth, from
the Office of Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs.

“It is difficult to discover who
has dropped out and who has
transferred or left for reasons
that had nothing to do with"
Pitt, but our research has
revealed that a shocking 21 per-
cent of the drop-outs are leaving
for reasons related to the organ-

the university,” said Firth.
The Provost’s - Retention
Committee (PRC) was formed
two years agoto study the rea-
sons for the overwhelmingly
high drop-out rate. The first
agenda item was faculty respon-
sibility. Is the faculty meeting
minimal requirements’ like
attending their classes, holding
office hours, showing up on
time, etc? Suggestions were
made about enacting a system
of accountability for professors
who were not meeting their
minimal requirements, and
perhaps correlating ‘perfor-
mance with salary increases.
Another project the commit-
tee has reviewed is a phone—a-
thon intiated by‘Firth. He set up
a questionaire and had trained
students phone those who had
dropped out to discover what
their reasons" were, if their leav-
ing was related to Pitt, and
whether or not their decisions
to leave were avoidable.
“Many of these people said

place,” said Firth. “Many felt
confused over scheduling
procedures, didn’t understand’
how to deal with us, had finan-
cial aid problems that could.
have been
know to apply to graduate, or
didn’t think to check with an
advisor about closed classes.”

The 20 percent avoidable
drop—out figure held up in all
the schools, and most of these
students left because of misun-
derstandings or inability to
obtain information.

Firth and his‘ group sug-
gested an Information and Re-
ferral Center'to the Provost’s
Retention Committee. The
Center was proposed as a cen-
trally located place that would
be welcoming and friendly,
where anyone could go to
obtain information about the
university on demand.

Fred Koloc, of the CAS Advis-
ing Center, strongly supported
the idea, and claims the PRC’s
reaction to the idea was the rea-

P The State Of Today’s Press

The press itself has been mak-

through several embarrassing‘

incidents and been the subject
of a critical movie. What is the

ton Post andThe New York
Times Magazine during the
past year are an indication of a
growing flaw in thejournalism
profession. I

“I -don’t think there is any-
more of a flaw now than there
has been in the past-the differ-
ence is that they are getting
more publicity,” said White, a
professional who has worked in
the’ field since I965. “Every-
thing relies on the integrity of
the writer and the editor.” 1

According to White, the only
real protection a writer has and

an editor in particular, is to be

more alert and aware of the
careless mistakes that have been
allowed to slip into the media.

Although he said he does not

according to the prevailing
mood of the country, White said
the “unnecessary emphasis
placed on prizes in journalism”
and the desire (spurred on by
Watergate) on the part of repor-
ters to do investigative stories
contributes to the pressure that

often leads to inaccurate’

reporting. —
The part-time English pro-
fessor at Pitt also said that he

does not foresee a future in

Michael Mcﬁough
Associate Editor,

Although newspapers some-
times make “honest” mistakes,
the overall quality of the press is
much better today than it was 20
years ago, according to Pitts-
burgh Po.st—Gazett€ Associate
Editor Michael McGough.~

McGough said that journal-

ists are better educated today,
and that incidents such as the
Janet Cooke hoax or the New
York Times Magazine fraud
don‘t indicate that the stan-
dards of the press are declining.

“I don't think the fact that

these two things happened; 

within a year and a half tells
anything about whether news-
papers are more or less careful,”
McGough said. .

McGough said the two inci-
dents were different. Janet
Cooke, who manufactured a
story that later won a Pujltizer
Prize, was on the staff of the
Wa.s‘h2'ngt0n Post, and presum-
ably hired after a selection

about a tour of Cambodia, had
employed a free lance writer
and used different checking
systems.

According to McGough, the
movie “Absence of Malice,"
which portrayed the press as
being negligent and vindictive,
was an inaccurate picture.

In the movie, a reporter wrote ,

a story about a man who was the
subject of criminal investiga-
tion, but never contacted the
man for the story. —
McGough said that “it was so
obvious that the reporter

I should have found him for an

other side when _someone is
under a criminal investiga-
tion," he said. “That happens
more often because of time con-
straints, or when the stories

involve a public issue rather
against’

than direct
someone. ,
“It’s a different story when

cha rges

- the person being investigated is

the subject of criminal
charges."

McGough said the careless-
ness portrayed in the movie is
not characteristic of the press as
a whole. ‘

“Fairness and objectivity do
exist," McGough said. “There's
a greater feeling that the press is
working to get the other side."

He said that a criticism of the
press comes from those who
have an ax to grind against it-—
such as public figures. One crit-
icism is the press’ use of
unidentified sources, a criticism
which McGough believes is
unfounded. '

“People who follow news-
papers know the press doesn't
regularly manufacture sources,”
he said.

McGough said that when an
anonymous source is cited in an

 article, the source is usually

either identified in a subse-
quent article or the information
is legitimized by events.

An example of this, he-said,
was the secret fund

that"

ll"a.s‘/zington Post reporters Bol)
Woodward and Carl Bernstein
reported on in their Watergate
stories. The fund was later
referred to by a grand jury, and
was mentioned by both Bob
Haldeman and John Erlich—
man in their books.

McGough also contended
that for those who believe they
have been wronged by the press,
there is an avenue of redress-—
libel suits. ‘

He ‘said that the Supreme
Court has made it more difficult
for public officials to win libel
suits, but that decision'consti-
tutes a “rough justice" because
the courts advocate an agressive
press when it comes to covering

public officials.
According to McGough, the
press is self-policed by its own

' codes of ethics, which require

fairness and objectivity.

He said that politicians often
perceive that the press has a
conspiracy against them, but
that assumption gives the press
too much credit.

“Their complaints are sub-
j/ective,” hesaid. “Papers do
make mistakes. but they have
nothing to do with any
attempts to get someone."

He said such mistakes are
honest ones, made because of
sloppiness or time constraints.

“not as a result of a centralized A

decision by editors."

for infringement when Cham-

lI"l'l.E LISTENINGI

Al|Tl'l£ BEER,  

  ANDALOTOFLEGWORK.

When the guys at Miller asked me to
write an ad on writing, i said, “Forget it.
Not even it you held a gun to my head’ So
they held a bottle of Lite Beer to my mouth.

They’re a pretty persuasive group.

TIIIIES III MIIGS _

if _you’re going to write anything, know
what 'you’re talking about. And that means
three things: Research, research, and
more research. The more you know, the
more you can tell your reader.

Take my characters. A lot of them i
base on actual people. There’s this buddy
of mine who pops up in every book I write.
in one story he’s a cop. in another, a pri-
vate eye. Once, i made him a millionaire.
Using him not only helped make character
development a heck of a lot easier, he was
so carried away by the rich image, he
bought me a lot of free dinners (and a lot of
Lite Beer from Miller). So use the people
you know as models.

   

c 1981 Beer Brewed by Miner Brewing Co , Milwaukee. Wis.

Even locations should be based on
real things. If you're writing about a bar, i
know that bar. Hang out there. Watch the
bartender. The customers; Whatever
they drink, you drink. When they drink
Lite Beer, you drink Lite Beer. Re—
member-research is most fun when
you soak up as much subject matter as
you can. it can only help you paint a

better picture.
II. nou.

No caper is complete without dames
(or ladies in proper English). Experience
has shown me that in mystery writing, the
sexier the dames, the better. Experience
has also shown me that sexy scenes make
great punctuation marks. This is where
research has the greatest potential. Use
your own discretion in this matter. But
when you write about it, don't be too
explicit. That way, your reader gets to paint
a more vivid picture.

by Mickey Spillane

CHAR 10 PAPER .

O.K., you’ve got your characters, loca-
tions, and dames lined up. Now comes the
good part: Putting your caper to paper.
There's no mystery to it. As long as you
write the ending first, the rest will follow.
Write short, terse, to—the-point sentences.
Be as clear as possible. And make sure
you’ve‘ got the right stuff around for when
you get thristy. After all, writing is pretty
thirsty work. ‘

I suggest a couple of mugs of Lite
Beer— who ever heard of a caper that
didn’t involve a couple of mugs?

Why Lite Beer? its a lot like me and my
books—great taste, less filling (some
people can't get their fill of my books), and
always good to spend time with. ,

At any rate, follow my advice and, who
knows—you might turn out a heck of a
story. Or you might turn out to be a heck of
a Lite Beer drinker.

' bagged lunches.

  Bag It
Burger Chef

_ Our first reactio upon hearing about Burger Chef’s
recent policy prohibiting bag lunches to be brought into
the restaurant was, like that of many other students-—-

. who’d want to eat there anyway? went, the fact of the

matter is, whether or not commuters and other students
want to eatthere, Pitt has been so negligent in its treat-
ment of those students that many of them have no choice.

Well, on second thought, they do have a choice: They
can either eat outside, which doesn't seem too realistic
around this time of year, or they don't eat" at all.There is
one more option: They can eat the food sold by Burger
Chef—which isn’t much of a choice come to think of it.

This whole sticky episode occurred the other day when
it was discovered, by no fault of their own, that Burger
Chef was instituting a policy forbidding anyone from
bringing in his own food. Upon hearing of the policy, a
Pitt News reporter was told to “go read the sign on the 17th
floor.” That was it, aside from a few “no comments” from
Burger Chef manager Vic Foster, who, incidently, didn’t
feel the matter important enough to warrant saying no

comment himself, but instead said it through a third,

person. « .
The problem with that reaction is, if it’s so important
that brown baggers and their ilk be kept out of Burger
Chef, then why can't Vic Foster. have the courtesy to let us
know—in-a reasonable and polite manner? We can under-
stand that someone may be shy of the press, but the least
Burger Chef management could do is to make some sort of
written announcement instead of hiding the whole thing
behind the counter, as it were. i
The policy also brings up the question of what specific
rights does Burger Chef have in enacting such measures?
Although Burger Chef leases that space as a legitimate
franchise, it is nevertheless within the confinesof univer-
sity property, and should be a little more respectful of the
persons who are shelling out tuition money to maintain
that property. In which case, the university administra-
tion should be a little more vigilant in protecting the
rights of its students as they apply to university premises.
_ Granted, there is probably another side to this story:
Burger Chef is losing money because of the brown
baggers, and since they are a business, they should try to_
prevent the loss of money. We don't know, however,
whether or not Burger Chef has actually ever figured, out
how much money it was losing, and if so, how? If there are
such statisticsavailable, Burger Chef certainly hasn’t been
very up front with them. ' -
Thefolks at Burger Chef should remember that they
have been a constant source of aggravation on this cam-
pus, from the evening students who complained that the
restaurant closed too early,,to most students who think the
food is overpriced andjust plain lousy. With that in mind,
Burger Chef should have known thatanything more they
did to raise the ire of students was bound to result in
protest. . .
Finally, there’s the question of enforcement. Are Burger
Chef’s employees going to kick the brown baggers out?
And if they do, how are they supposed to say who’s a

A ‘brown bagger and who isn’t? Is it the student who orders a

cup of -coffee from Burger Chef and then proceeds to eat a
three course meal from home? Or is it the student who
buys a three course meal from Burger Chef and pulls out a
thermos of coffee from" home?

Or, on the other hand, is Burger Chef going to enlist the
services of the campus police ,to kick the brownbaggers
out? If they do use the campus police, who are supposed to
be enforcing the law on university property, then Burger
Chef must be under the jurisdiction of the university,
which shouldn't allow such a policy. On the same subject,
don't the campus police have anything better to do than
hang around looking for brown baggers? If not, then
Pitt’s campus must be pretty safe. '

In fact, Pitt’s campus is nowhere‘ near safe enough for

the campus police to waste their time enforcing) such a '

silly policy, and Pitt’s commuters really have very few
places left to go if they want to sit down and enjoy their
In light of this, we recommend two
things: Either Burger Chef come forward and state exactly

‘what this policy is and why it’s being instituted, o_r Pitt

administrators get their act together and provide some
more accomodations for our commuter students.

Pitt Theatre Negle

_ Dear Editor:

One question: How can a Univer-

. sity of Pittsburgh -- newspaper
« devote an entire section of one issue ’

to entertainment in Pittsburgh and
fail to mention even one Pitt-
related theatre company? We
have—-right? hereon the Pitt
campus—-the University of Pitts-

burgh Theatre, which presents

plays that are consistently
acclaimed by professional theatre

-critics; the Three Rivers Shake--~

speare Festival, which is going into

"its third season of professional

Shakespeare plays in Pittsburgh
(and has received national atten-
tion through a" front-page Wall
Street journal article). Both of
these companies perform in Ste-
phen Foster Memorial Theatre,

considered by many to be one of the '

finest theatres for straight drama in
the entire city, and located right
beside the Cathedral of Learning
on Forbes Avenue. This week the
University of Pittsburgh Theatre

. will be opening its run of All The

Way Home (Mar. 4-20), and the

, Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival

will be holding auditions this Sat-

' urday and Sunday (March 6 8c 7) for
‘ its third season. Close to 200 actors

are expected. i

And that’s not‘ all. The City
Theatre Company (CTC) is a pro-
fessional company in existence
since 1974 and associated with
Pitt’s Theatre Arts Division since

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to Tim

~ Kearney’s opinion in the Feb. 17

edition of The Pitt News (“Must
We Be So Mighty?”). First of all, I
am sick and tired of all aspects of
the media taking opposition to
everything the president of the
United States says or proposes. No
wonder the country is in such poor

shape, what with’this lack of sup- '

port. Where is our patriotic spirit?
What ever happened to the saying
“United we stand, divided we fall"?
Perhaps we should look around.
Each interest group is interested
only in their own benefits.

Yes, there is unrest in America.
Perhaps that is why Ronald Rea-
gan was elected president two years

ago._He proposed change in his‘

campaign speeches. Now he is try-
ing to carry out those campaign
promises. This is something that I
cannot remember any other presi-
dent doing in my life time. (Presi-
dent Carter promised a tax cut. We
got a tax raise.) Why all the fuss
now and not then?

One example of President Rea-
gan's proposed change is 2: “mil-
itary buildup"

I can recall in history that the presi-
dent is using our military strength
to aid our economy without a war.
Yes, a peace time build up would
be great. How many people would

Kearney. mentioned? How many
other people could be employed

without the death and destruction ‘

of war? Why not give it a try? The
democratic approach has always
been to get involved in a war to do
essentially the same thing.

As for the president's budget
cuts, he is not proposing the elimi-
nation of programs, only a reduc-
tion of availability while
supporting only those who truly
need it. This country was not built
on government handouts. It was
built through hard work and self-
sacrifices. The president wants to

Rutgers _

 Imposing

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

They’re big and they’re bad.
They have a 6-9 center, a first-team
all-Eastern ,8 selection, sporting a
newly-shavenjhead and his same
old shot-blocking ways.

They have a wingman whose
-ability was good enough to get him
a scholarship at Kentucky until he
transferred.

They are the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers, they stand between Pitt
and the finals of the Eastern 8.

“Rutgers is playing as well as
any team in the league right now,"
Pitt coach Roy Chipman said.‘

Evidence. A win over West Vir- '

ginia on Saturday. That’s sixth-
ranked West Virginia, the one that
had won 22 straigh games. Rutgers
even made it look easy. '

The Scarlet Knights are a team
capable of big things. Like a win
over UCLA and St. John’s. Then
there are little things. A loss to St.

Bonaventure and George

Washington.

“Sometimes the kids get carried
away. That’s how we get upset,”
Rutgers coach Tom Young
explained.

When Young lost point guard
Rich Brunson to surgery early in

the year, Rutgers turned erratic. As-

went freshman point guard Brian
Ellerbe, so went the ‘Scarlet
Knights. Some nights, Ellerbe
would run the offense efficiently,
and some nights, well just ask St.
Bonaventure. But Ellerbe’s play
has turned consistent, as has
Darius Griffin’s coming off the
bench.

Griffin’s play against West Vir-
ginia was a big part of the Scarlet
Knightsupset. The speedy guard
not only handled the Mountaineer

pressure but also stole several‘

passes. Compare him to Pitt’s Dar-
rell Gissendanner. Instant quick-
ness , instant offense.

It is assumed by nearly everyone
save the small gathering from
Olean N;Y., that the West Virginia
Mountaineers are in the finals of
the Eastern 8 tournament.

After all, Gale Catlett-’s crew has
a 25-2 record, a national ranking,
the West Virginia fans, and just
about all the accolades of every

Eastern 8 official. Why, three of ,

their playersmade first or second
team All-League. Rumors have it
that the Mountaineer was consi-
dered for a spot on the all-star team.

“Based on the media we’re just
here ‘for a cup of coffee, and to go
home Saturday morning,” ~ St.
Bonaventure (14-I3), coach Jim
Satalin joked. St. Bonaventure?
Doesn’t West Virginia have a bye
into the finals? West Virginia’s sea-
son, which has brought some
much needed attention to the East-

em 8, has made them the darlings’

of the league. Rarely has a day gone
by without some mention of the
basketball wizardry in Morgan-_ P
town. And the madness.

But still, the Mountaineers have
to play St. Bonaventure tonight in
the first game of the Eastern 8 semi-
final doubleheader. Most say it is

-mere formality. Even ‘Satalin,

appears a litt1e.awed. _

“They ‘have great depth, and

speed. They are probably the best

, team in the East, and certainly in

the league,” he said.

West Virginia’s running game is
well known, and as well as their
penchant to play nearly everyone
on their bench, but what may not
be known is. that the Bonni I

Gavitt to quit?...

The Big East basketball league,
Pitt's new conference beginning
next’ season, may welcome the
Panther men’s basketball team into
the fold with a new commissioner.

Reports have been circulating

that current commissioner Dave

Gavitt is interested in the New
York Knicks head coaching job left
vacant by Red Holzman‘s
announced intention not to return
next year.

‘Gavitt has said he would be
interested in the job “under the
right circumstances.” The Knicks
approached Gavitt about coaching

Vaughan snubbed...

Pitt -forward Clyde Vaughan, the
Eastern 8’s regular-season leading
scorer and third-leading

rebounder, apparently still hasn't
convinced league officials of his
talent.

At yesterday's pre-tournament
press luncheon, the Eastern 8
announced its all-league team, and
Vaughan’s name was conspicu-
ously absent from. the first-team
selections. T

The coaches did vote the 6-4
Panther sophomore to the second
team, opting for Duquesne’s Bruce
Atkins and Rhode Island's Marc
Upshaw as the first-team forwards.

Other first-team all-league selec-
tions were center Roy Hinson of
Rutgers and guards Mark Jones of

St. Bonaventure and Greg Jones of

West Virginia.

joining Vaughan on the second

Try for
Easterns

By SCOTT DELLETT

This is an important weekend
for the Pitt Panther track team,
which travels to Princeton to par-
ticipate in the prestigious IC4A
Eastern Championships. ,

The Panthers finished 11th in
last year's meet, and Coach Mike
Agostinella is hoping Pitt will fin-
ish higher than last year.

This meet also represents the last ,

chance for runners to qualify for

the NCAA championships next

weekend at Pontiac, Michigan.
“Runners can use the meet to
qualify for Nationals,” said ‘Agos-

_ tinella, who expects many people
i to qualify for Nationals, due to the

high level of the competition.
Participating for Pitt this week-
end are,Darren Geary and Garland
Brown in the 800-meter run, Todd
Colas and Bill Moorhead in the
1000-meter run, Rich Asberry in
the 55-meter hurdles, and the one-
and two-mile relay teams. ,
This meet is unique because
team scoring is kept. Agostinella
wouldn’t venture to predict a
winner, but he said he believes his
squad should perform and finish
respectably in‘ the standings.
“There's plenty of high quality
competition in the meet,” Agosti-
nella said. “I’m in the business of
training, not guessing, but all our

‘ runners have fine opportunities to

score points.”

The meet is being held jadwin
Gym, on a 220-yard Tartan track
which Agostinella considers to be
“pretty good.” The favorites to
capture the Eastern title are peren-

Ghilani

,,  
Gets Shot

At G oa I i e
By LISA GRENlEVlCl(l

Dave Ghilani's soccer career has
been one marked by happenstance
and kind breaks.

ET The former striker-lurned-goalieii

has suddenly emerged as one of the
leading candidates "for the Pitt
soccer team's goaltending chores
next fall, thanks to his fine play
during the current indoor season.

Pitt Head Coach Leo Bemis uses
the indoor season to give the
young, as well as the experienced,
players a chance to improve their
skills.

Bemis is looking for a replace-
ment for senior goalkeeper Scott
Thunberg, the 1981 fall season's
starting goalie.

Bemis is lucky to have a few
young players out to fill Thun-
berg’s shoes, including Dave Chi-

 I1l, a freshman who played

hind Thunberg this fall.

Ghalani comes from Peters
Township, where he was an.All-
W PIAL goalkeeper his senior year.

Ghilani began his soccer career
in fourth grade at Gastonville Ele-
mentary, where. soccer was the

major sport, according to Ghilani.

Peters Township didn't have a
varsity soccer team until Ghilani’s
senior year, so Ghilani gained his,
soccer experience through a recre-
ational soccer league.

Oddly enough, Ghilani started
off as a striker—a goal scoring
p0sition—before his recreational

- coach, Bob Chiocca,, encouraged

him to switch to goalie. ‘ .

Gymnasts Go South

By BRIAN BALK

If there ever was a time when all
the hard work of gymnastics would
really substantially payoff, this
weekend would be it. While we are
fighting thedrudgery of winter, the
Lady Panther "Gymnastics Team
will be travelling to South Gaines-
ville, Fla., this weekend to take on
the University of Florida’s Gators.

Florida should be stiff competi-
tion for the Lady Panthers. They
have already claimed the Southeast
Conference title by defeating_sev-
eral top notch opponents such as
Alabama and Louisiana State Uni-
versity. '

According to Pitt Coach Donna
Sanft, Florida is consistently scor-
sing in the 141 to 144 range.

“If we can break into the 140's we
have theicapability of beating Flor-
ida,” Sanft said. A

Although the Lady Panthers

. have only posted a high score of

139.25 this season, a 140 mark is
within their reach as sophomore
Lisa Shirk returns to competition
in the all around position. Shirk
has almost fully recovered» from the
bone spur operation on her ankle
in early January.

She jokingly said, “I can throw
Tsukahara vaults and double back
somersaults. they don't hurt. ‘It is

   
 

thesirnple leaps which are killing
me!"

Another element which should
improve Pitt’s score is the better
judging Sanft expects at Florida.
The Lady Panthers have not seen
the likes of "just scoring” lately.

“Other teams that have travelled
down south have gotten a fair
shake scorewise. I.think we will
experience the same thing,-” Sanft
said. ' .

As teammate Karen Martin more
bluntly put it, “It would be nice
not to get ri.pped off by the judges
for once."

Time heals all wounds, and for
the first time this season the Lady
Panthers can finally claim a
healthy roster. -“Many of our girls
are coming off of injuries and back
into the lin_e~up,” Sanft said.

Gretchen Speich will hopefully
compete on floor exercise event
after a two-month sprained ankle
ordeal.

“I reallyhopewe can hit 140 or
better becauseit would really boost
our confidence going into East-
ems," noted Sanft.

When the ‘Lady Panthers-are .

basking in the Florida sun they
probably will not, be thinking
about all the hard work and deter-
mination it took to get there. Their
minds will be focused hopefully
upon that score of 140 which will

_rrounce the: Gators.

Ghilani
Gets Shot
At Goalie

 ilytteontinued from page eleven

' “One day I was goofing around
in the net and Coach Chiocca saw
me and asked me to try out the
goalie position,” Ghilani said. ‘

“I used to hate to play in goal. I

' always thought all the glory was in
scoring. Now I enjoy playing
goalie. I like catching the ball and
using my hands instead of my feet.
I like the idea of the play coming
right at me,” Ghilani added.

Ghilani claims it has been the
help of Chiocca and Thunberg that
has improved his goalkeeping
skills. _

“Chiocca thought I had quick
hands and that I should play

*g1alie,” said Ghilani. “He used to

1‘, me that if I made it anywhere,
I“ make it as a goalkeeper.

“When I came to Pitt, I lacked
confidence,” added Ghilani. “I
thought I couldn't fit in here, but
Scott (Thunberg) really helped me

‘out. He’s a super guy. He has
volunteered to work out with me
and he tells me my strengths and
weaknesses.” V

Ghilani is using the indoor sea-
son to gain experience and playing
time.

“The indoor season helps a lot,”
explained Ghilani. “The game is a
lot faster and it makes me think
quicker. With more shots coming
at me, it will help me- to develop my
S. ills for the outdoor season.”

 . hilani will have his hands full
this fall, battling for the starting
goalie position. Bemis has several
recruits lined up to help fill the gap
left by Thunberg.

“It’s going to be tough competi-
tion to make the team,” Ghilani
said. “I’m just practicing and try-’

ing to improve all—around and

become quicker.

“My goal is to be the No. 1
goalie, without a doubt. I cannot
stand sitting on the bench and
watching someone else play in
goal,” Ghilani said.

No matter what happens this

 Ghilani says he loves playing

‘er and gets pleasure out of it.

“Goalie is a crazy position. I’ve
been kicked in the face more times
than you can imagine and I’m
always getting hit in the head. You
have to be nuts to be a goalie, but I
love it.”

strategy that Satalin will not hesi~
tate to use again. “We will hold the
ball for a good shot. Our average
possession will take about 27
seconds,” Satalin said. Catlett,
maybe more so in fear of a stall
than anything, has voiced his
displeasure.

“If he holds the ball, they should
look at his contract. It’s boring,".

continued from page nine

But it’s not the Scarlet Knight
guards that worry Chipman. It's
the two monsters. One of them is
the most intimidating, and the best
(‘enter in the league, Roy Hinson.
The other is a sharpshooter, zi
former high school All-America. a
former Kentucky Wildcat, Clar-
ence Tillman. Against West Vir-
‘ginia both were on". Hinson
rejected six shots, hit turnaround
jumpers; and the inside was
Rutgers’. Tillman hit several long

bombs and scored 15 points and the .,
sows»

game was over. .

"Their size concerns me. We’ve.
had problems all year with big
teams,” a wary Chipman said.

How big? How about Hinson at
6-9, Tillman at 6-7, and Chris Nie-
berlein at 6-8? That's a front line
that controlled the boards against
West Virginia, never allowing
them to go into their vaunted run-
ning game. It’s a line that has to be
countered by Chipman.

“We‘Il ‘have to pressure them. I
don’t know if we can keep up the
tempo for 40 minutes and come
back the next night. But we will
press them," ‘Chipman said.

A press, hopefully, would create,

- has,
some turnovers but more lInp0!}-Q_5;;“t'

tantly would not allow Rutgers to
turn the game into a half-court
affair. Allow them to do that, and
Hinson will be throwing up six

‘foot tumarounds all night.

A “A press also would enable us to

get some baskets without Hinsoii ’

set‘ up on defense,” assistant coach
Reggie W arford added’.

Letting Hinson plant himselfon
defense is dangerous. A formidable
shot blocker, Hinson’s presence
turns normally active guards into

-shy’ little creatures who pass’ off
instead of getting their shots sent,

back. ‘ /
A Pitt-West Virginia final is still
a dream. A dream that faces a giant

obstacle. The Rutgers Scarlet‘:-is

Knights.

PITT NOTES: Game time is 9:00

venture game ends...Darrell Gis-

to play as we are capable of.”

(Izemerda also believes the team
needs a strong game from goalie
Jeff Rohaway along with some
good defense.

“We need jeff to play his usual
superior game," (Izeinerda said.
“We also need a lot of back-
