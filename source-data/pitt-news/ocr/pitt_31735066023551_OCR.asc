City and campus police are
continuing their investigation into
last Wednesday’s bomb threat that
lead to the evacuation of areas in
and around the Russian Room of
’ the Cathedral of Learning.

The city police bomb squad
discovered a large brown paper bag
that _ was believed to be" an
explosive device. After _the con-
tents of the bag were examined,
\ police discovered two tightly-rolled
copies of the Pitt News, covered by

jelly.

Campus police received a phone
call at approximately 3 p.m. from a
person whosaid there was a bomb

aluminum foil, and a jar of grape.-

in the Russian Room of the
Cathedral. Officers were dis-
patched to the scene and evacuated
the classroom and all areas
immediately above, below and
beside it, according to Curt
Graham, Campus police chief.‘
“We received the -call and
responded to it by examining the
room and taking preventative
measures necessary _to protect the
lives of individuals in the build-
ing,”.Graham said.

Two students in the classroom’ at

the time said the evacuation was

quiet and orderly.

“The police came in and talked
to Dr. Orbach (the professor)
outside the room and we were told

Campus Police Investigate Cathedral
  Russian Room Bomb 1'hreats

we had to leave,” one of the
students said.

The bomb threat at the Cathedral
was one of several to occur at Pitt in
the last few, weeks, Graham said.
Besides the Cathedral, Benedum,
Schenley and,Scaife halls were all

. pinpointed as targets for bombings
by anonymous callers.

Graham added that the recent
series of threats is not unusual";
similar threats occur every term
during ﬁnals ‘and midterm testing
periods.

“We receive large numbers of‘
threats,” Graham said. “Quite
honestly, they occur frequently.”

Students, firemen, and police watch,ed anxiously last Wednesday as members of Pittsburgh's gomb andArson'
Squad removed what was believed to be a bomb from the Qathedral.

In its first political endorsement
ever, the Pennsylvania Student
Association of State Related
Universities announced its support
of State Rep. Joseph" Rhodes,
D-East Liberty, in hiscampaign for
the U.S. Senate. -

The student association is a
2‘/2-year-old lobbying organization
which represents over 156,000
students at Penn State, Temple,

The four universities currently
represented by the association are

  ' United Nations Security Council Meets to Discuss Iran  

By The Associated Press

UNITED NATIONS—The U.N.
Security Council met for only 16
minutes Tuesday on the U.S.-Iran-
ian crisis, hearing pleas from
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim
and the. council president, and then
adjourned until Saturday.

In one of the shortest formal
council meetings on record, Wald-
heim called on the United States
and Iran “to avoid any action which
could inflame” the situation.

The council president, Ambas-
sador Sergio Palacios de Vizzio of
Bolivia, repeated an appeal to Iran
he had made in the council's behalf
Nov. 9, asking for the release of 49

A A American hostages held in the U.S.

Embassy in Tehran.

Palacios de Vizzio then ad-
'journed the meeting until 9 p.m.
EST Saturday, when Iran’s acting
Foreign Minister Abolhassan Bani
Sadr is expected to be in New York
to join in the resumed debate.

Iran had sought a week’s delay,
while the United States had
pressed for a public meeting to call
again for the release of the
hostages. The Tuesday session
was "a compromise, with only
Waldheim and the president

‘permitted to speak.

The United States dropped its
insistence on speaking Tuesday,
U.S. Ambassador Donald F.

speech would “be incorporated in
the council president's statement.”
Saeed Sanjabi, an Iranian special
envoy, said of the U.S. decision,

Earlier Tuesday, Iran’s chief
U.N. diplomat, Jamal Shemirani,
formally asked the 15-member
council to postpone its meeting
until Saturday evening when, he
said, Bani Sadr would be present.

Shemirani said a Security Coun-
cil session on the volatile embassy
confrontation would not be “oppor-

the Moslem holy days of mourning.

“There is talk these days that the

A Second?

Native Tongue

When federal Judge Charles W. Joiner ruled that
black English must be considereda second language,
a shock wave reverberated throughout school
districts across the United States.. The
superintendent of schools in York, Pa., voiced at
typical response, claiming black English was not a
legitimate language and vowing never to allow its
teaching in York public schools. Such statements
were based on misinterpretations of the ruling by
many, including ‘US. News and World Report,

' which said the court order could force schools to

“provide bi-lingual education for about 3.4 million
black young people believed to speak nonstandard
English,” at a cost of some $1 Billion in Federal
funds plus other money from local and state
governments. ,

Emotional feelings about the Detroit ruling have
cooled, and more reasoned consideration of the court
order has shown that Judge J oiner’s findings are not
as serious a burden as first believed by educators.
Instead, many now see the order to be one that could

help black students in the United States receive any
special aid that they need.

A close look at the original suit against the Ann
Arbor, Michigan, school district shows the ruling to
be a reasonable one. Eleven pupils at the Martin
Luther King Jr. Elementary School in Ann Arbor
were classified as retarded because their command of

“English was inadequate. Two public interest lawyers

who represented the l1'£rgued the students deserved
better treatment and that the best way to do that was
to find that standard English was the second
language for the 11. The judge concurred with this
argument, stating in his opinion, “Full integration
and equal opportunity require much more (than
busing or scatter housing to achieve equality), and
one of the matters requiring more attention is the

’ teaching of young blacks to read standard English.”

Because of the suit, Ann Arbor’s schools have
taken the steps necessary to give speakers of black
English more attention. First, the school system put
the 11 pupils involvedinto regular classes. It also has
trained its teachers in sociolinguisitics so that they
can recognize that the dialect spoken by many blacks
is as good a functional lauguage as standard English,
and that students should not be criticized for their
use of the dialect. at ' '

Recognition of this by the Ann Arbor teachers,

and other teachers in the United States, has to be seen
as‘ a postiive step toward realizing the language
differences of black Americans. A separate dialect
has been developed by’ blacks during the years of
slavery and it still exists among blacks today.’
In order to give blacks in the United States the
education that the law guarantees, educators must
acknowledge this fact, and learn to deal with children
who. speak this dialect. . .
Viewing black English as a separate language and

not as “bad English” ‘is only the first step in teaching
speakers of this vernacular standard English. After
accepting black English as a type of proper speech,
teachers must learn to encourage students to talk
even in bad English in the primary grade, to avoid
alienating them from school. Then, students must be

-introduced slowly‘ to standard.English so that they

can function in mainstream society where this dialect
dominates.‘ , , h ‘ ,
Refusal to realize that black English is a distinct
and functional language can have only poor effects.
When educators treat the black American dialect as
poor English, they only alienate young pupils who
know no other way to speak the language. Purposely

' rebuking those who speak black English thus creates ,

the divisions in America that everyone has sought to

destroy since the 1940s. /

I would like to comment on the
article that appeared in the
November 16th issue concerning
the Iranian situation. This article
speciﬁcally mentioned a meeting
that was held on campus. sponsored
by the Anti-lmperialist Student
Union and Americans for Justice in
the Middle East.

I find th’at I must disagree with
some of the comments of ‘Debbie
Ehrlich, coordinator "of the event.
Ms. Ehrlich raised the point about
the Shah standing trial for his
alleged crimes.

The question in my mind is one
of fairness. Can the Shah receive a
fair trial in Iran. Given the present

‘.\situation, I doubt it. The‘ actions of

the Iranian students‘ in the seizing
of our embassy and the holding of
American citizens in some sort of
terrorist game proves it. And the
actions of the Khomeini in
supporting this action shows the
moral bankrupcy of his regime. It is
regime that is built on hate. A blind
hatred for the Shah, for the West.
for America, and for modern
society. I
I question whether life under the
theocratic dictatorship of the
Khomeini is any better than life
under the Shah. Does the Khomei-
ni ‘permit dissent? Why is the
Khomeini suppressing the Kurdish
4‘ "olution? Is there religious
tolerance in Iran? '

According to todays news reports
(Sunday, November 18) the blacks
and the woman among the
hostages were to be freed and the
white males were to be tried under
Islamic justice as. spies. While I do
not feel that our embassy personnel
were spies. by what logic could the
spies be only white males? Could
not the blacks and the women been.
spies also. It is a strange system of
justice that pre-judges on t'he basis
of sex and skin color. ’And'yet, I am
expected to believe that the Shah
can get,a fair trial in Iran.

Even if we return the Shah what
guarantee do ‘we have that the
hostages will be released? If they
are spies. shouldn’t they be tried?
Why were they not tried as spies
two weeks ago? These are.
questions supporters of the Kho-
meini and the students should
answer,.4_'jI,t_‘ oneinnocent person is
harmedfthen their blood is on your
hands‘ just as it is on the hands of

I Writer Claims ShahWi|l NeverReceive

  Validation
infringes. .. 

It seems as if the University has
taken another giant step backward

in‘ the service to its students. The '

University has introduced a new
kind of validation “card” for the
winter term. Instead of the nice
wallet-sized validation card that
has been used in the past, the
University has come out with an 8
by 11 inch combination statement/
validation form. I see no reason
why a student must carry around a
personal document disclosing his

financial status with the university.

as a proof of registration; The -lower
portion of the form, that is to be
validated, could have easily been
designed in the old card-type
format so that it might be detached

and carried in the wallet along with -V

the student’s permanent I.D. card.
But instead it states “Not valid if

detached from statement.” I find

this new form for student validation

an invasion of my ﬁnancial privacy,

and just plain inconvenient t
handle. -

This is still another letter about
the new validation card system.
The card I reads, - “Not valid if
This
statement must be carried at all
times with permanent ID cardfor
university activities and services
(such as check cashing, athletic
events, and library use).” The
validation card is also necessary for
voting purposes, concert tickets,

and many other ,.university con-.

nected functions. There is a much
stronger objection to the new card
than its .inconvenient size. The use
of‘ the entire statement for
validation purposes is "an un-’
necessary violation of the students’
rightto privacy. ‘

I ‘Handing-v-this statement over} to
show your validation card for any
university activity or service also
gives another person direct access
to your financial ‘ information,’
located directly above the vali-
dation section. This information is
personal and must be ' strictly

of Student Accounts. All measures
should be taken to protect this

zati_ons are giving a student grants
and/or loans, if a student -is a

Pennsylvania resident,,or even how 

many credits a student is carrying.

This objection is even greater
becatise the student has been given
no reason for the change from the
old wallet-sized validation cards. I
cannot see how the new form will
better serve the purpose of proving
that I am a registered student in
good financial standing in the
present term. Isn’t this in fact the
purpose of a validation card? More
importantly, the old card serv‘§3,

this purpose witlfout violating my '

right to privacy. A

I, would like for this letter to
serve '-a purpose instead of just
being another complaint. Even if
the validation system is changed
for Spring term, we still should not
have to tolerate this system all next
term. The Office of Students
accounts has an obligation to
maintain the students’ privacy.
They should allow students t§
detach the validation statement
and have it still be valid or offer us
a more acceptable form of
validation upon request. If my
suggestion cannot be follovtg.

Accounts has still another obliga-

SGB Election/Scandals Shocks   Freshmen Students

As freshman here at Pitt, we
have recently encountered our first
SGB election and we are shocked
and appalled by the wave of
scandal that has arisen in its wake.
Although this is our ﬁrst experi-

ence with the policy and character *

of the election committee, we are
disappointed tha'5they ignored the
discords of the ESC resulting, in
our opinion in an unfair election.
As a result of the ESC’s scandal,
the voters turned out heavily at

,Benedum Hall, retaliating against

the candidates who signed the
letter protesting the ESC’s alleged
bribery. Itlis evident from the
tallies by poll that Daloni and
Germain, two candidates who
protested the ESC, lost in
Benedtim Hall which may indicate
that it wasn’t a neutral polling
place.

In the light of these events, we
tend to agree with Mele’s
statement thatvit is interesting how
the election process weeds out the
most honest of the candidates. We
also agree that certain governance
groups should not have such a
profound effect on the outcome of
an election that is supposed to
represent the sentiments of the

A Rebuttal
To a Rebuttal

The following is a rebuttal to the
letter from Tim'Gaus that appeared
in the November 21 issue of the Pitt
News.

With all due respect, Mr. Tim

Gaus, you have either read only the

parts that you wanted to read, read
only between the lines, or did not
even read my article. As a result
you misunderstood certain sections
and did not understand some at all.

First, the “number of indivi-
duals,” “turkeys,” “anomalies,”
grid “birdbrains” that I referred to
are not the “certain Pitt students”
that you describe, unless you feel

  Brightetl 1111      
your holidays  1 

' 1

that “many” Pitt students_fall in
one of more of my categories.
Advice: If you’re going to write a
rebuttal, make sure it pertains to
the article in question and not one
that you have invented.

Second, you must have read
several of my unpublished articles
to ~observe my “usual” trend in
“sniping at America!” Advice; a)
Choose your words, and b) inform
me of the literature upon which you
base your conclusions. .

Third, nowhere in my article did
Isay that “Americans should have
no emotion...!” Are you sure you
read my article and not someone
else’s? Advice: Don’t get emotional
to the point of losing control.

1 Fourth, you talk about “Ameri-
cans” in you second paragraph and
then equate them with “people of
this country.” Don’t you see any
distinctions? Advice: a),Take some
courses that look at things from an
international perspective, and b)
since you have a serious weakness
in typologizing, feel free to read my
term paper that deals with the
subject. ‘ 4
Fifth, if you think you and others
can resolve problems of a complex-
ity that are far beyond your present

capabilities of understanding, then
go ahead and worsen this “mess”
with more violence. And if burning
ﬂags, harassing students, and
protesting are the correct or
American way to express ‘feel.
ings,” "“e'motions,,’.7__ or “patriot-
ism,” then again go ahead. An eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,
right? I

Mr. Gaus, I strongly suggest that
you read my article again. This
time do read it, read mine, and
read.

Arka Kargodorian
IDEP —

1975 lncide

Recalled  

A glance at the Pitt News and
Mr. Miller’s allegations of tran-
scripts being seen by unauthorized
personnel reminds me of an
incident that occured when I was an
undergraduate in 1975.

I’m proud to say I made an “A”
in German 2. I also specifically
signed a “Refusal to Release of
Information “Form” provided by
then - Dean T.H. Dunkelberger
prior to receiving the “A”, to

nt

protect my transcript. _

Within a week after the, grade
reports Iwas deluged in the mail by
tour offers to go to Germany. I had
never received a tour offer to go to
Germany before. And, after about
a month, a tour offer to Germany
was never received again. During
the brief bit of time after my grade
report, I received over ten.

Of course it could be a weird
coincidence. Or, a classmate may
have given my name to a
salesperson. who placed it on a
mailing list.

However, it is also a fact that
informaton cannot be protected if
the value of the information
exceeds the cost of the risks needed
to obtain it. People hired by the
University to handle student
records must be (if impeccable
integrity. They hold student
futures in their hands. After all,
freedom is not possible without
privacy.

Please know I accuse no one.
There are many possibilities, and I,

with a raised eyebrow, thought it I

timely to relate my own story.

’ / Pitt News Staffwriter
Like Joe Paterno, Pitt Coach

Jackie Sherrill realizes the impor-
tance of Saturday’s game between

I I the 9-1 Panthers and 7-3 Lions.

“There’s no question it’s a big
game for both teams,’ ’ Sherrill said

yesterday. “It’s a climax of the *

season, and it’s a game everyone
looks forward to all season long.”

The Panthers have beaten the
Lions only once since 1965, but
Sherrill refuses to believe that
Penn State holds a mystical jinx
over his team. Instead, he likesuto
ponder the definite variables
involved, meaning the players on
both, sides. Sherrill is a very
confident about his team’s ability
to play good defense.

“I’ve never been around a team

that, defensively, enjoys practicing
as much as this one,” he said.
“They really want to practice, and
that’s one of the reasons we’re a
very good team defensively.”
Paterno has Sherrill in a slight
predicament now, because he
hasn’t announced his starting
quarterback. Paterno may use his
regular starter, Dayle Tate, or he
may go to Frank Rocco, a reserve.

Despite their superior record, coach Jackie SherriII’s Panthers are two-point

underdogs.

When asked to be more speciﬁc,

' Trocano in a situation where

I Rocco seems to be the sentimental

favorite, and. Sherrill tends to
agree. V

“He’s (Rocco) got a lot of talent,
and he’s got a lot of conﬁdence in
himself,” said Sherrill. “I, per-
sonally, think they’ll start Tate,
and if he’s not able to move the
ball, they’ll bring Frank in, which
will probably give the whole
stadium a big lift.”

Without Matt Millen, Bruce
Clark and Rick Donaldson, the
Lions aren’t as awesome, physical-
ly, as in the past, but they’re still a
force to be reckoned with. '

“They are still .very good
defensively,” insists Sherrill.
“Millen and Clark made them very
dominating defensively, but with-
out those two, the other people are
probably playing harder. ,They’r’e
moving a lot better, and their
secondary in the last two games
has played very well. They’ll be,
without a doubt’, the best team to
rush the passer that we’ll play.”

And howqdo the Panthers plan to
combat the stingy Nittany Lion
defenders? Sherrill raised a few
eyebrows when he said Rick

though‘ Dan Marino will start.

-rill." .“He’s "running “well, he’s

Sherrill hedges, but ‘he gave the
impression that’ he might use

‘ corners. (with an option attack).”
.Howeverj, if Sherrill feels com-
pelled to pass, Marino will do the’

ﬂinging.

“‘If I was going to have to throw
into the wind, I'd like to have
Danny in there,” Sherrill ex-
plained-. ‘fThe wind won’t affect his
arm, because he has such a strong
one.”

And what about the noise from
the 77,000 at Beaver Stadium?
Could that rattle the freshman?

  Nit-Picky Pitt Panthers Not Picked Over Penn State

“Danny handled the crowd at
Morgantown (W.Va.) all right,”
said Sherrill. “And if‘ you can
handle that crowd, you can handle
anything.” '

, Another external factor besides
the crowd noise could be the

weather. Although Paterno casts i‘e—:~}

aside as not being significant
enough to work to one team’s
advantage, zSherrill takes an
opposite stand.

“The home court advantage is
big when you play a game like this
one,” he said. “And the weather is

a factor. I don’t care what anybody -

(Paterno) says. They get to practice
throwing, catching and kicking into
the wind, because their practice
facilities are out in the wide open.

We don’t get to do that.”

State’s Joe Paterno doesn’t mince words when he

But before all you students give the Lions and‘ 20,”

consider some important variables. First, the Penn
State Nittany Lions are not a bad football team.
They are 7-3, and are coming off two impressive wins
over North Carolina State and Temple. Second, the
Lions are very similar to a rattlesnake, meaning that
they may not be very well liked, but they should be
treated with the utmost respect and reverence. -And
finally, the Lions have -beaten the Panthers 13 of the

have better overall balance than those from Happy
Valley (which should be called Unhappy Valley after
the uncharacteristic rash of defections, demotions

and arrests of thelast few months). .

' Football Problems at Penn iState?iLea”ve Eveiytﬁingto Joe    

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Staff Writer

The most important game of the
season for the Pitt Panthers is not
the Fiesta Bowl but the ‘upcoming
battle with the Nittany Lions from
Penn State.‘ The Game, as in
previous years should be an

exciting affair marked by spectac-

ular plays on -both sides. '

For Coach Joe Paterno it has not
been a banner season, as the Lions
have had injury problems and sport
an un-Penn State-like 7-3 record.
This year's edition is not as strong
as seasons past but nevertheless
this squad does possess some
stalwarts who can give the

Panthers some headaches.

Paterno realizes the importance
of this game: “This is the most
crucial game of the season. We’ve
had a somewhat disappointing
season but this game could make it
for‘us. Pitt is without a doubt a

super "team that deserves better
fate in the polls.”

The most crushing‘ blow to the
seemingly. endless list of injuries
had to be the loss of All-Americans
Bruce Clark and Matt Millen.
Paterno comments on the loss of
the two best defensive performers
and its effect on the defense, “The

’big"thing about their loss is that

we’ve had to adjust our defensive
scheme from week to week. We’ve'
had to do alot of guessing and
sometimes we can guess wrong and
get burned. One thing we
realize—-without them in the lineup
we have to hustle more and just
keep coming.”

Not wanting to give Pitt added
emotional incentive, Paternoewas
high in his praise for the. 9-1
Panthers. “They're an awfully ﬁne
football team. I think their defense
is outstanding—-especially Ricky
Jackson, he’s just super. The
offense is improving every week

The Pitt women’s basketball
team garnered consolation honors
at the Cincinnati Classic over the
Thanksgiving holiday. In their
debut, the Pantherettes lost a
heartbreaker to ‘Morehead State.
55-54. Pitt bounced back for their
first win of the.season with a 62-56
victory over Southern Methodist
University. ‘

The young Pitt squad (two
starters are freshmen) battled the
defending Classic champions,
Morehead State, to‘the very end.
Morehead held a nine point lead at
the half, but Coach Jean Balthaser
decided to remain with the original
game plan—a methodical, delib-
erate offense. This time it worked.

The Pantherettes turned the ball

over only eight times in the second
half, after losing it ﬁfteen times in
the ﬁrst. Morehead could not
penetratethe tough Pitt zone and
the game remained a one or_two

play, the Pantherettes;-could not
cash in on two one-and-one
situations. A ﬁnal shot missed,

If you thought Pitt had a problem
with their quarterbacks. Paterno is
suddenly faced with the decision of
who to start, Frank Rocco or Dale
Tate. Rocco seems to have the
inside track thanks to his perform-
ance against Temple. When
questioned about his two signal

_callers /Paterno declined to give

answer, ‘‘I don't know who I’ll start
and I won’t make my decision ’till
Thursday night. I have to see how
both of them do in practice.”

In assessing his own football
team Paterno was realistic if not
overly humble. “We're not _as
strong as in past years and we need

a couple of tough games to get us

going but I feel we can do some '

things that can win football
games,” he said.

,For almost as long as there has been Pitt football,

 ‘ "there ha-s been a game and a great rivalry with Penn
 State.

In face, the Nittany Lions are the Panthers

The series, which dates back to 1893, has been

" close, and only in recent years (the last five or so) has
‘ Penn State been able to take an edge, leading the

series 39-36-3.

However, there is supposedly a magical, mystical
jinx on the Panthers, according to many writers and
fans alike. For instance, despite Pitt being the
obviously superior team in 1976 (the same year Pitt

to become national champs),,some folks were

 hesitant to give the Panthers the edge before the

game.
Coaches and players from the two squads say

_ , :“phooey” to any such rumors, of course, but in the
  lastfew years, Pitt has really had its problems“ when
_' playing the Nits. ~ V

made much harder seeing that my brother, nine
years older than me, was a Penn State fan. Penn

State could have been thebest football team ever to '

take the field in a given year, but I wanted no part of
them. I would have cheered for Warsaw University if
they would have been playing the Lions.

In 1974, I witnessed my first ‘Pitt-Penn State
footballgame through the goodness of ABC-TV,
which that year began a string of. six consecutive
years of televising the game nationally (this year’s

, game included).

Sitting in my living room, I would have done any
Pitt student at the time proud by saying such things
as...well, I’d better not mention them now, .at least
not in print. Unfortunately, despite all my help, the
Panthers lost the game 31-10, finishing out a 7-4
season. _ .

The next year, 1975, was definitely a milestone in

my Pitt-loving, Penn State-hating career. I witnessed I

in person,__ for the first tiine, the ultimate showdown.
_I ‘sat content as could bein the freezing-col'd confines
of Three Rivers Stadium, watching a great struggle

between the two teams, which ended in a 7-6 State .
In that game, the Panthershad an extra "

point‘ blocked and three Carson Long» field goals go

‘ . astray; How depressing.

But in the year of the Heisman, national
championship, Sugar Bowl and “you name it, we
got it” honors, Pitt and I got revenge by downing
the Nittany Lions easily 24-7. Oh, the thrill of
victory and being able to scream “We’re No. l" at
that game. I felt like a Pitt student already.

However, after becoming one of the above (a Pitt
student), victory has eluded the Panthers, and this is
going to be my (oops, I mean Pitt’s) year of revenge.
The 15-13 loss in 1977- was not only bitter because of
the tight game, but I was bitter...brittle actually,
because of the weather. I still don’t.believe that I

went,,up to the stadium at 11 a.m. to “get a good ,

seat.” The worst part is that it. was my idea—my
friends will never forgive me for their frostbite.
Last season, I traveled in my small, cramped and

shaky Chevette up. to University Park to see the «

Panthers take on -the No. 1—r'anked Lions. I thought
“This is‘it, the year Pitt pulls off the big upset. Penn
State can’t win a national championship. They never
have and hopefully never will.” Well, thank God
and Alabama that the Lions weren’t champs last
year, but the Panthers played one hell of a game
against the Nits despite losing 17-10. ‘
Come Saturday, I will be among the 76,000 fans at
Beaver Stadium, barring only the breakdown of
myself or my car. Even then, I’ll try my hardest to
make it. This is the year that I get revenge; not on

. anyone in particular, except maybe my brother, but I

will. get revenge. My prediction is a Pitt victory by a
score of l4~l3.. By the way, I usually don’t make
