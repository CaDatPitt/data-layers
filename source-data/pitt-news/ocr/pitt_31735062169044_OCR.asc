SCHWEIKER RAPS

  ARCHAIC

“The political system we have
been using badly needs reform-

- ing,” said United States Senate

hopeful, Richard Schweiker. “Its
main trouble is that it has not
been able to modernize with the

SG Takes

‘Power’
Position

by PEGGY ALLEN

After much watering-down of
the original proposal, Student
Government (SG) took their of-
ficial stand on Student Power at
the Wednesday night meeting.
The passed resolution states that

“The Student Government of the
University of Pittsburgh recog-
nizes and supports the student
power movement as a movement
designed to gain for students
their full rights as citizens, their
right to democratically control
their non-academic‘ lives, and
their legitimate participation to
the fullest extent in the adminis-
trative and educational decision-
making process of the Universi-

ty...”

The resolution also declares
that “Student power encourages
self—development, which is an in-
tegral part of the educational pro-
cess . . .”

The senators rejected that the
portion of the resolution which
recommended SG recognize the
rights of students to ‘control such
specific areas as registration, es-
tablishment of any social or rec-
reational regulations, and-all dis-
ciplinary decisions .regarding the
violation of student regulations.

There was a great deal of dis-
cussion before the resolution was

' passed. Senator Kent Weitzel sug-

gested that since SG was suppose
to represent all students, the stu-
dents themselves should be al-
lowed to decide. “But,” argued
Senator Harriet Eisenberg, one
of the sponsors of the resolution,
“We aren’t saying that this meas-
ure is passed by the students, but
by SG.”

In its approved form, the reso-

‘ lution “formally recognizes the

intrinsic right and responsibility
of students to govern themselves,”
and calls upon both “the faculty
and administration . . . to recog-
nize these areas of student
rights,” and the SG “to call for
and to attain such rights.”

Two other proposals were pass-
ed. The first stated that SG “pub-
lically recognize and comment
on the efforts of the students of
Random House in their attempt
to express their views on an issue
that directly affected their lives.”
The second protested that MDC
schedule a meeting on the first
night of Rosh Hashananh, and stat-

. ed that, in the future, SG recom-

mend that “all university’ organ-
izations give due respect to the
religious holidays of their mem-
bers . . .” v

changing times.” Schweiker is a
very outspoken critic of Senator
Joseph Clark, and has many out-
spoken views on the controversial
subjects of today.

His most revolutionary view
concerns the establishment of an
all volunteer army. To attract
more volunteers, Schweiker pro-
poses that they be paid the mini-
mum wage. Also those people
with technical skills, would auto-
matically be given a higher rank
than private upon enlistment.
“This would make a more effi-
cient and economical military
system,” he emphasized‘.

, Schweiker also had some very
interesting views on our welfare
system. “People wanthands up
instead of hand outs.” “The func-
tion of government,” he went on,
“is to provide programs to train
people for skilled and semi-skilled
work, not to just simply make

jobs available, and give hand outs

like welfare checks.

On the question of our com-
mittments, Schweiker feels that
we can’t be the world’s police-
man, and that we must-be very
cautious about committments
that concern national policies.
He‘ feels though, that in a case
like Israel, we should assert our
position. “One our" main prob-
lems in dealing with foreign af-
fairs, is that we drag our feet,
and don’t let our positions become
known.”

Schweiker outlined many pro-
grams for changing many of the
nations policies, and says that he
can_ forsee their realization in a
few years.

MDC Proposes Trial Board

“Not Sufficient,” says Gervase

by BRUCE LEVEN SON

Men’s Dormitory,Council
(MDC) has proposed a judicial
board to judge student offenses.
involving male dorm, students.
Tentative by-laws were written
that will be subject to further con-
sideration.

The primary funtion of the Ju-
dicial Board will be to determine
corrective action in all cases re-
ferred to them by the Housing
Office. No cases can be acted up-
on that are not presented by the
Housing Office.

MDC Action on Judicial Board .... 

Violations can only be report-
ed by counselors and administra-
tive officers.

The sentences, though left to the
discretion of the Board, must be
finalized by the advisor if they
are to take effect at all. Any de-
cisions may be appealed, to the
Director of Housing.

The Board will consist of five
permanent members and three al-
ternates. They will serve two
terms and be selected by a com-
mittee. The committee will con-
sist of: the director of housing or

 

his representative, the president
of MDC or his appointed dele-
gate, a member of the counselor’s
staff, the chairman of the current
judicial board, and the advisor to
that board. The justices are per-
mitted to call any witnesses that
they deem necessary.

If an offender‘ should fail to at-
tend his hearing, he will be sen-
tenced in abstentia.

-The offender cannot call wit.-
nesses for his defense but may
ask questions concerning the pro-
cedure.

Nick Gervase, MDC president,
discussed t h e Judicial B o a r d
Wednesday evening over WPGH
radio, in an interview with Assis-
tant News Director David Hirsch-i
feld. » -

Gervase stated tnat he original-
ly hoped the function of the board
would be that the offending stu-
dent would be judged ’by his
peers, but realized that “it didn't
come out that way. ”

Hirschfeld asked if it was true
that an offender that goes before
the board is presumed guilty and
that there is no way that he can
be proven innocent.

“I believe so,” Gervase answer-
ed. The Judicial Board only has
the right to sentence an offender.
Gervase added, “They (the
board) don’t have the right to say

“We have to stop the killing before anything can
be achieved in Vietnam. The first priority-of the
entire Vietnam question is a cease fire,” says Clark.‘

After the initial cease tire the Senator would ad-
vocate a holding policy until free elections under
the supervision of the International Control Com-
mission could be held.

The Senator added an interesting footnote to our
discussion on 'Viétnam. “I am confident that Vice- 
President‘Humphrey will call for a policy that , .
would stop the bombing‘ of the North.” Clark feels’
that the Vice-President better advocate a bombing
halt or “He’s a dead duck.”

Linked to the tenuous situation in Vietnam is the
draft. When‘ asked about the feasibility of an All-
Volunteer Army, Senator Clark says that “it would ,
be a very expensive venture.” Right now the de- ‘
fense budget is about $82 billion and the Volunteer .._
Army would pose a threat to civilians controlover ~ - '

Senator Clark says, “The younger men should
be drafted first.” He suggested that only men be-
tween the ages of 18 and 19 be susceptible to the
draft. “This,” says the Senator, “would erase the
uncertainty that plagues men graduating from col-
leges. The draft now has a delterious effect on our

has nominated Senator Clark for
re-election and the Senator ad-
mits that he can’t bere-elected

an d th e democratic structure.
“But as a Senator, I must main-

tain my independence in spite of '

the political consequences,” He
pointed out that at the Democra-

-tic Convention he voted for

George McGovern rather than
Humphrey.

Aside from Vietnam and the

draft, Clark is very much concern-_ . {L

ed with the general applications
of this nations foreign policy.
“We can’t continue to be the po-
licemen of the, world. We have to

cut our military budget and pool ‘A 

more money into our domestic
programs.”

The Senator believes that our
position in the “policemen of the
world” quagmire is causing a
great deal of fiscal instability.
“It’s time for us to get our fiscal
situation in order or the American
dollar will go down the drain.” .

To accomplish this, Clark would ‘

cut the budget of $25 billion.

Clark calls this the “Democratic ; ’

way.” The Republican way, ac-

cording to the Senator, “would be '

to kill project Head Start, stop
Federal Housing programs.” In
short, “the Republican way is to

slash Federal programs and create  V

programs for white people.”

New Group Sets Committees.-

  

National Youth Lobby  
Campaigns For Action

Kenneth Rothschild like mil-
lions of young people today, is
outraged at his “second—class stat-
us” in American society. He con-
tends that draft-eligible citizens
are being exploited by the politi-
cal system, and that young peo-
ple should take action.

Rothschild’s answer to youth’s
problems lies in a National Lob-
by to campaign solely for the
views of the young in the politi-
cal arena. The fault, he main-
tains, is in the decision—making
process in the US government,
which, in the case of the Vietnam
war, made a war decision rather
than a non-war decision, because
they took into account the inter-
ests of the adult population and
completely neglected the inter-
ests of the generation ‘which
would have to fight and die in
the war. ,

“The beneficial value of war,
although only slightly greater
than those of non-war, continual-
ly lures Johnson,” Rothschild
says. “The harm of war can be
very great. What Johnson has
done is reduce the probability of
harm for himself and his consti-
tuents (adults) while still pursu-
ing the rewards.”

Rothschild hopes th e Youth
Lobby, for which he has issued a
proposal, can be a way for youth
to fight back against such deci-
sion—making. The Lobby is to be
‘an “interracial, non-partisan pow-
er center,” is to set up an organ-"
ization “which will be’ influential
in directing current legislation,”
and is to provide a clearinghouse
for youth’s opinions.” It is clear-
ly not for those who wish to com-

pletely tear the present system
down and start over, for those
_who think the established politi-
cal process is incurably ill. The
Lobby is for young activists who
need a constructive outlet for
their rebellion, its objectives in-
clude “providing some rapport
between youth and the establish-
ment.” »

The main evil Rothschild wants
to change is the draft, which he
sees as the most blatant exploita-
tion of youth by adults.

While he does not advocate
making the old fight or even turn-
ing the decision making entirely
over to the young, heproposes a
way to “make the old agonize,
too.” He calls for the establish-
ment of a volunteer army. both
because it, “unlike the present
Selective Service system, is not
involuntary servitude,” and be-
cause it would make the cost of
war greater than the cost of
peace.

Waiting for the months it takes
a revolutionary idea to become
accepted, and the additional
months it takes Congress’ slow
legislative process to work, how-
ever, is not acceptable.

“We must be able to pressure

decision - makers t o a ct now,” ,
“no matter which party lS adm1n- '

istrating. Do you think the young
care whether they die under a
Democratic or a Republican ad-
ministration?”

The only alternatives now avail-
able to the system for young peo-
ple. are desertion and anarchy,

the Lobby maintains. It hopes to _

give another possibility.

Views Contemporary Issues 

by SHERRYL ZIPPAY

Process ‘68, recently formed by
concerned students of the Univer-
sity, is composed f independent
study—action group centering on
relevant issues of the world to-
day. Through research and discus-
sion involving both students and)
faculty members, the individual

0 group attempts to objectively ar-
ticulate as many facets of a par-» ‘

ticular issue as possible. This is
the education stage.

he isn’t guilty.” The MDC presi-
dent feels that the power of the
board “isn’t sufficient, but it is a
good start.”

Even though a student cannot
be proven innocent the Judicial
Board “has some alternatives
even if they believe someone is
guilty. . . . They can give him a
very small sentence or a suspend-
ed sentence,” concluded Ge1‘va1.\'c.
“That is probably the best way
we can get around this.”

Penn State has a Judicial Board
that Gervase admits is “far su-
perior” to the one proposed here
at the University. At Penn State
the student is innocent until prov-
en guilty. He has the right to leg-
al council. The Judicial Board is
made up of students. Any decision
can be appealed to a student ap-
pealboard. ‘ »

Hirschfeld‘ pointed out that the
board can call witness but the of-
fender cannot. “I’m quite surpris-
ed that it has been left out,” Ger-
vase replied. '

“Is it really "a Judicial Board or
a sentence board?” ” questioned
Hirschfeld.

“I’d have to say it is (a sen-
tence board) ,” reasoned Gervase.

When asked how many judges
have voting powers, Gervase an-
swered that there are five. He
could not find any statement in
the by-laws to support his conclu-
sion.. ’ ' ‘

The groups then discuss the
most effective of action that can
be taken, based on the results of
the initial education process. The
action canltake any form that the
group decides. 'It may decide to
circulate the information that has
been gathered during th e re-
search and discussion stage or to
engage in a number of separate
actions such as demonstrations,
letter - writing, canvassing, de-
bates, etc. This is the action stage.

Each group has total freedom
from other groups, and no pre-
suppositions are made about the
form of the research or of the ac-
tion to be taken.

On ‘issues such as Vietnam and
the national election, much of the
information is already widely
known. These groups may decide
to proceed directly to the action
stage. Inter-group communica-
tions and interpersonal relation-
ships ‘will combine to form an
educational atmosphere of dis-

cussion and learning as well as a.

potentially unified and powerful
force to effect meaningful change
in our society. ~

Committees have been formed
in seven different areas of inter-
est. Each committee is free to
change any or all of the suggest-
ed topics. Any students who are
interested in areas which are not
already included in Process ‘68
can join and form additional
groups which will cover these
topics. H

The Civil Rights Committee
can choose from a wide range of
topics. It could look into recent
civil rights legislation to see what
effect these have had on racism
in the US. The Kerner Commis-
sion Report could also be exam-
ined to determine the changes to
be made in future civil rights
laws. This committee will also

“Are there any rights given to
the accused?” queried the mod-
erator. -

“In essence, replied Gervase,
“there are not. I believe the de-
cision-, guilty or not, will still lie
within the Housing Office.”

Hirschfeld wondered if the of-
fender’s right to be innocent
would be included in a revision
of these tentative judicial laws.

On the whole Gervase things
that “MDC has more of a voice
with the Housing Office than in
the past.'”

“Did MDC have a voice in the
Peterson case?” Hirschfeld inter-
rogated.

Gervase made ashort reply,
“No comment.”

Plea For Reason

Men’s Dorm Council has again come through with flying
colors by creating the very dubious student judicial board.
The Board will judge student offenses involving male dorm
students.

_ The primary function of this newly conceived organ will
be to pass sentence (corrective action) on disciplinary cases
referred to it by the Housing Office. These disciplinary cases
can only be reported by counselors and administrative officers
and no cases can be acted upon if they are not presented
by the Housing Office. The so called sentences of the Judi-
cial Board must be approved by the Advisor. If the advisor
does not approve the action of the Board, the decision will
not take place. Finally, all decisions of the Board can be ap-
pealed to the Director of Housing.

The idea of a student judicial Board is a sound one. “But
the MDC conception of a judicial board has ome serious flaws.
The most serious drawback to the MDC creation is that the
Board has no influence in the decision of guilt or innocence.
How can a judicial Board be termed a “Judicial Board”
-when its student members merely have a sentencing power.

In other words, the student Judicial Board will put the fin-
ishing touches on a student who has been through the “ad-
ministrative courts” lodged in the Housing Office. The only
change, then, is that students will be deciding the punish-
ment of their peers. They still have no say in judicial pro-
:cess that involves students.

We can’t understand the reasoning behind the MDC Ex-
ecutive Board’s proposal. All citizens in America learn that
the cornerstone of, our judicial process lies in the maxim,
“innocent until proven guilty.” Oddly enough, the "MDC
scheme provides for the more “undemocratic” maxim, “guilty
until proven innocent.” .

When asked if it was true that an offender that goes be-
fore the Board is presumed guilty and that there is no way
that he can be proven innocent, MDC President Nick Ger-
vase said, “I believe so. They (the Board) don’t have the
right to say he is-n’t guilty.” Gervase adds that the power of
the Board isn’t sufficent, but it is a good start. .

In fact, in a WPGH interview, the MDC President seem-
ed somewhat distrubed by the fact that only the Judicial
Board can call witnesses. "I’m quite surprised that it has been
left out.” Gervase admitted that the Judicial Board is, in fact,
a misnomer. He agreed that this new organ is actually a sen-
tence board. And we think the concept of a student sentence
board that processes -“student offenders” is absurd.

‘ All is not lost, however. The frail voices of absurdity~
can be transformed into the resounding reverberations of «
strong-will reason. Isn’t it reasonable to assume that any
student should be judged innocent until guilty; isn’t it rea-
sonable to assume that the student defendent should be al-
lowed to call witnesses in his behalf? This apparently is not
the case, according to the reasoning of the MDC Executive
Board’s proposal.

The Pitt News advocates a more positive judicial sys-
tem here at the University. The due process of the law must
‘be followed and this means in part, that student representa-
tives rriust be seated on some organ that says “guilty or in-
nocent. We also believe that the “Judicial Board” should
not be a separate body that functions as a “Sentence Board.”
A judicial Board should both judge and sentence.

We urge the Senators of MDC to reject the Executive
Board s proposal and formulate a new Judicial Board that will
allow students to do more than merely “pass sentence” on

‘Someone Please Help Us . . .’
--Starving Pitt (Mercy) Co—Ed

by GEORGE LIES Associate Editor
A phone call to this office recently brought out
the horrendous fact that scores of Pitt girls, staying

. at Mt. Mercy College due to the shortage of space

at the University, are starving to death.
The phone call went thusly:
“Hello . . . Pitt News?” asked a girl’s voice."

“Yes, Pitt News,” I answered-

“I don’t have very much time to.talk. I’m talk-
ing from a pay phone. They have spies and inform-
ers all over this place, and I have to watch my
step,” said the girl frantically.

“LET ME get on with what I have to tell you.
We’re starving up’ here. Some of the girls haven‘t
been to class in a week; they appear weakly and
pale. They’re not eating right,” explained the girl.

“What’s wrong?” I asked her. '

“They don’t serve us lunch because we don’t
stay at the Towers. Mt. Mercy doesn’t have enough
room at lunch time. We only get breakfast and sup- -

per. But we don’t get any lunch. All Pitt does is ‘

cut 50 dollars from the board bill-”

“We have to eat at the Tuck Shop, or the Tow-
ers snack bar,” she continued. “I thought they
were kidding when they said we couldn’t eat lunch.
But when they said we could eat food in those two -

- Please . '.

places. I found they were really kidding. Food‘?
Ugt! ” she exclaimed over the line.

“ISN‘T THERE anything that can be done?” I
asked.

“Well . . . sometimes I sneak into the Towers
because I know someone who checks meal tickets.
-But some of_ the girls up here can’t leave their
rooms. They’re too, too weak. One girl has lost 20
pounds, another has gotten ‘mono.’ and a third girl
was treated for malnutrition. This is a serious prob-
lem: this isn’t something petty like student power
or firing Bill Peterson,” she said very sternly over
the phone.

“What can i do to help?" again, I asked.
"I don't know. Maybe write something in the

. paper of our peril, our dying need for help. And we
: do need it desperately. So desparately,

she said
and then continued.

“WE’RE NOT asking for much. Just food for
the mouths of babes is all we ask. Please help us.
 Her voiced tailed—off quickly because
someone saw her on the phone. I heard the receiver
slammed down on the hook.

Then I thought, I wonder who is responsible for
this. What administrative genuis thought up this
budget cut. But then'I remembered this was the
University of Pittsburgh.

The Language it Requirement:
Stud-ent’s ‘First’

by MARC SIMON
As darkness set in, Mrs. E opened the lace cur-

tains that covered the front picture window and shield-

ed her house from the light of day. The day had pas-
sed much the same as the year before it had. Mrs.
E. smiled at her husband, who was sitting in his
favorite chair while copying over a speech that he
would recite to the masses on the following day.
“Isn’t that the speech you read last year?” she asked.

“Yes, dear, and I read it the year before and the
year before that. In fact, I’ve read it so many years
I should know it by heart, except that . . . ”

“Except what, dear?”

“Well, except that I just don’t completely be-
lieve init, that’s all. I guess if I really did I Wouldn’t
have to be sitting here copying and recopying it

' overf’

“But dear,” Mrs. E. said, “it’s such a beautiful
speech. Why, it has it’s liberal parts, its conserva-
tive parts, and its authoritarian parts. It’s so won-
derfully balanced, it . . . . ” «

“That’s just it,” interrupted Mr. E. “You see,
dear, once someone has listened to it he feels as if
he’s been hit by a bowl of lukewarm mush, and
the mush half-cooked at that. The line——I mean speech
-—is so indefinite, so wishy—washy. . . . ”

“Well, it was good enough for your predeces-
sorsf’

“Yes, that’s true,” said'Mr. E., drawing himself
up to his full height. “After all, I am Mr. E.”

Just then the phone rang and Mrs. E. went to
answer it. Mr. E. startedworking on his speech
again, but he stopped when he saw through his front
window a slight movement on the lawn. “I wonder
what that could be, “he muttered. “Probably nothing
at all. ”

Mrs. E. returned to the room with a shocked look
on her face.

“Whatvis it, dear?” asked Mr. E. “You look as if
you just heard about a threat on your life.”

“My God,” she moaned, “it was the Kirks’ from
Columbia Drive. Mrs. Kirk just told me that a gang
of rowdies have threatened her house and are hold-
ing Mr. Kirk prisoner in his office! They say they
won’t let him go until they get ransom for him!”

“Easy, dear, we’ll lend Mrs. Kirk the money.”

“They don’t want money,” Mrs. E. cired. “Mrs.
Kirk said that what they want is all the copies of
your speech! They say they’re going to burn them!”

“That’s strange,” said Mr. E., “but maybe it’s
because Kirk and I use the exact same speech.”

Suddenly Mr. E. was interrupted by a crash on his S

front picture window. It was the Power kids hurling
invectives at his house.

Fearing what had just happened to the Kirks,
Mr. E. timidly stuck his head out the door and
asked, “What do you want?”

A spokesman representing all the groups said,
“We want you to open the curtains in front of your
picture window during the day. We want you to see
us, and we want to see you, too.”

by DAVE TIERNAN

Many students are concerned

with the current talk about stu- combinedwhy?

ses than in all the other classes

countries that would be far more
interesting, and informative, to
students than endless lists of words

 

, their peers.

dent say-so in University policies.

With the “Speak Your Peace”
conference, which is scheduled
for early October," students will
have the opportunity to confront
the administration with specific
proposals for changes. It is now
time to cite some specifics.

In what ways do four terms of
cramming, memorizing, and re-
peating a foreign language add
to a student’s liberal education?
When was the last time the stre-
ture of the language courses was
evaluated? What is the use of four
terms? Wouldn’t two suffice?

For one thing, since I have been
at the University, I have noticed
more cheating in language clas-

Lack of interest in useless mem-
orization, no foreseeable use of
the language in the future, and a
need for the valuable hours (that

are supposed to be spent going

over and over the‘ same words for
better things, could all be reasons

‘ for cheating on the exams.

And if we are forced to com-
plete four terms of a language,
couldn’t the second two terms be
on a pass-fail standard, so our
lack of -interest would not result in
injured QPA’s or cheating?

As far as the old cry that lan-
guage will broaden our minds
goes, it is not true.

There areimany historical, cul-

tural and social customs in foreign

to be memorized. Why aren’t these
customs taught in basic language
courses?

In a generation where one must
read and study to keep up with
his own customs and language,
shouldn’t there be a stress on one’s
language rather than on the lan-
guage ‘of countries that teach
English in most grade schools, the
majority of high schools, and all
universities. Here, English is only
required for two terms, while a
foreign language is required for
four.

It is time that the language re- . H

quirement be evaluated, studied,
and changed by those that must

abide by it'—the students.

 

Levenson, Stoller, Pitt News Scolded  

For S1-anting Facts In Peterson Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

In the recent issue of the dis-
missal of Bill Peterson, The Pitt
News showed itself for the in-
competent s t u d e n t newspaper
that it truly is. It is commonly
known that newspapers often
“cite scripture for their own pur-
pose” in order to show favor to
one side of an issue. I will admit
that The Pitt News under Paul
Stoller’s editorship does a truly
remarkable job of taking sides
without the complete knowledge

V of the facts.

It should be known to those in-
volved and interested that Peter-
son’s dismissal was not sparked
by the cafeteria incident as The
Pitt News stated, but instead, the
dismissal was finalized by that
incident. The Pitt News made it
a point to show what a terrific
resident assistant Bill Peterson
has been. How good can an RA
be. when he lets people know, be-
fore the year begins, that he will
not work with the head resident
and that he has no respect for
him at all? Of course, Peterson is
entitled to feel this way, but with
such an attitude he is totally in-
effective a s a counselor, and
shouldn’t have received or ac-
cepted the job. In previous years
Peterson may have been well
thought of as a good counselor,
but having winning teams and an

open house every week is not‘

what constitutes an effective res-
ident assistant. When Peterson, a
third year counselor pleaded ig-
norance to a n obvious misde-
meanor, he showed himself as a
third rate counselor.

The Pitt News stated that Mr.

Zabec’s reason for dismissal of
Peterson rested on four premises.
Where the paper received these
premises is unknown. They sure-
ly did not receive them from Mr.
Zabec simply because he did not
state these premises.

As far as the counseling retreat
was concerned, Peterson had a
responsibility to his job and the
University as a resident assistant.
just as he had a responsibility to
his job for the Attorney General
of Minnesota. It is the employer,
and not the employee who dic-
tates what is, and what is not be
be done by the employee. This is
true in any job. If Peterson could

not accept what’the University
dictated to him as an employee.
he had no right to the position of
resident assistant. It would have
seemed even fairer if the Hous-
ing Office had gotten rid of Pe-
terson before he began his duties.
since it was clear that he could
not fulfill them.

The Pitt News quoted Peterson
as saying he didn’t need to be

trained at the retreat. The coun-
selors there were exposed to many
new 0 setups and regulations of
which not even the omniscient
Peterson was aware. In fact, any
house counselor who would di-
rect a floor assistant and two stu-
dents to enter the closed cafe-
teria by illegal means would need
to be completely retrained.

The Pitt News brought forth
personal issues which do not have
any bearing on the Peterson case.
I firmly believe that it is the in-
tent of The Pitt News to use the
Petersoissue as an experimental
case for student power. disregard-
ing justice to anyone in any way.
Random House has accepted its
new assistant without hard feel-
ings and is trying its best to re-
turn to the functions of a house.
The students in the house
resent the intervention of The
Pitt News. but Paul Stoller and
his staff are trying their hard-
est to ruin a goodehouse and a

good head resident for their own . .-

Through their ingenuity in plan-

I dislike your rashness in im-

Come now, Mayberry, let’s not be
hostile. The world isn’t that bad.
After all Pitt has a fine gymnasi-
um, where you should sweat off
all of your boyish energy instead
of straining your intelligence by
fooling around with a pen and pa-
per. Why if you hung around long
enough at the’ gym and didn’t
break any windows or write any
dirty wo.rds on the bathroom doors,
you might even. get a shot at a
night janitor’s job. You could be

-a somebody, a man with a unique

identity, Mayberry.

Think how you would be es-
teemed in your community for
getting a job. And if by some ac-
cident you managed to show for
work the second night, you would
be the greatest thing since Bouie
Hayden. You would be in a posi-
tion to get in on a goodthing, the
civil rights movement. You could
manipulate the masses of your
people, use them, profit by them,

. and maybe even open a bar on the

Hill as a sideline. You could be

rich, Mayberry, rich! You could

then eliminate your excess ener-
gy by running stop lights in your
new Eldorado, while smoking a
big, white seegar!

sity district. In general, I’m re-
ferring to Oakland. Particularly,
I‘refer to McKee Place. Speci-
fically I cite 312.

The landlord (who as of this
edition shall remain nameless)
promised the tennants completed
apartments for September occu-
pancy. By completed, we under-
stood that the apartments would
have heating. carpeting, -drapes,
and innumerous little things (e.g.
doorknobs). We obviously hane
experienced a discrepancy of be-

. liefs.

Considering the rents accepted
by this man (dating from Aug.
15, at which time the apartments
were not fit for human occupan-
cy), we feel that, as of Sept. 17,
it is only reasonable that we

. should have these things for p

which we paid.
we plead our caseito the stu-

‘ ‘dents. All we ask is moral sup-

port. ‘We are taking .steps through
“proper” channels at the present.
Knowing of your support, we
hope that these matters can be
expediated -and, hopefully,
brought to a satisfactory conclu-
sion.

Recording Review Rapped

Editor, The Pitt News;

I have patiently and unobtrus-
ively read you poor recording
(and film, for that matter) reviews
for the past three years. I have
not spoken waiting - like an Uncle
Tom — for things to get better.
They haven’t.

I see that Mr. Anderson has
written another so-called piece of
journalism. His reviews, like
those of another non-writer Ho-
bart Harris, are of the lowest de-
gree.

The superficiality of Mr. An-
derson’s “West Coast” review as-
tounded me: it is too painfully
obvious that Mr. Anderson knows
little or nothing about music in
general, rock music in particular,
and about the people who produce
contemporary music.

Sentences like, “The biting
satire . . . is hard to forget.” be-
long in a.junior high journal and
not in “One of America’s Great
Student Newspapers.” And who is
he to pontificate about “the most
important sont. . . . .?”

He complains about the Jeffer-

noise.” He says this is a child-
ish fixation.” I would ask him,
then, if Stockhausen or Ussachev-
sky or John Cage are childishly
fixated!

Foreign Study
Program To
Start In69 S

. In the fall of 1969, the Univer-
sity will inaugurate the first pro-
gram of undergraduate group stu-
dy abroad. Under the program,
forty students wach term will stu-
dy at the University of Rouen.

The course of study has been

planned so that students have ade-
quate leisure. to explore France.
Thus, the academic program will
consist of just four courses (12)
credits). ‘ '

To qualify for admission to the
program, students must have re-

ceived a minimum grade of B in ’
a third-year college French course‘.

Also, attendence at eight or ten
orientation sessions late in the
winter is necessary.

Cost for Pennsylvania residents
will be $750 plus a program fee of
$250. Out-of-state students will be
assessed an additional $500. Per-
sonal expenses will be the stu-
dents responsibility, including
books and return fare. .

Past annoyances almost forgiven.

Mr. Anderson has unloaded on the
Pitt campus possibly the least in-
telligent and most obnoxious criti-
que I have ever read about any-
thing. “The only way to judge
an album of this nature is by its
sensuous appeal.” This is horren-
dous! Music can and will be sen-
sous at times, but it never lose its

_intellect.

Any good piece of music (be-
ing possibly the most flexible of
arts) should emotionally appeal to
its listener but it also should have
some sort of intellect to it: great
music, in short, moves both-
Both, Mr. Anderson! — the mind
as well as the body.

Finally he speaks of the struc-
ture of an album as “basically
that of experimental music with a
few moments of sanity intersper-
sed.” Only a fool or an ignoramus
would make a statement of this
sort.

Assuming that Mr. Anderson is
of the latter class, I would. ask
him if he considers these true ex-
perimenters (in their lifetimes)
sane: Beethoven, Deb_ussy, Ives,

. Schoenberg, Stravinsky; '-Bartok, ‘
son Airplane’s use of“feedback and Janacek, Milhaudy FOSS’ partch’

etc. Since’ when is musical inno-
vation (either good or bad) in-
sanity?

Over Richey

Richey

I have been reading The Pitt
News for afew years and have a
high regard for its articles and, ed-
itors. However, in this year’s first
Pitt News there was a tremendous
error in overlooking one of the
greatest athletes in the history of

I this school. I understand that foot-

ball is the sport which could and
I hope will bring Pitt back into the
national famebut the Olympics
are the greatest single sporting
event in the world. It brings to-
gether the best athletes of over
100 countries. A Pitt athlete to be
a part of such an event would
not only bring national recogni-
tion but world wide fame. It is
true that there was an article on
Jerry Richey but naturally it was
buried under the debris of opti-

mism for this year’s football team.

Hidden back on page 32, which is
often never reached after wading
through each football player’s ap-
praisal of his teammates, is a helf
page article on a runner who al-

ready has more records than any I

runner, football player, or any

, other athlete in Pitt’s history. I’m
sure that football will justifiably

continue to dominate the sports
page in the Pitt News but to
the unsung heroes of Pitt sports
the real attention should be focus-
ed. Best of luck to Jerry Richey

American Chemical Society
Joined By Students Here

by JOE MISTICK

The University does have a‘stu-
dent affiliate of the American"
Chemical Society, (ACS):

“In the past, this organization
didn’t do a lot, but we have high
hopes for this year,” said Patrick
Alexander, president of the Uni-
versity’s student affiliate of the
ACS. .

As one of the 461 chapters now
active across the country, the Uni-
versity joins such local schools as
Chatham College, Mount Mer-
cy College, Duquesne University’,
and Carnegie-Mellon University,‘
which also have active chapters.

To be eligible for membership,
a student must be working on a
bachelor’s degree in chemistry,
chemical engineering, or relat-
ed academic discipline. He must
be in good standing and be nomin-
ated by two members of the ACS,
one of whom must be an instruc-
tor at the institution the student
attends. The sponsor of the stu-
dent affiliate at the University is
Dr. Darel Straub, a chemistry
professor.

‘Alexander stated the group.s
objective as this: “We want‘ to
generate interest in the field of
chemistry and its related fields.
We want to create ‘an awareness
of the research being done in all.
these-areas.”

A By having prominent authorities

. in these fields speak at meetings,
'by tutoring local industry, and

most important, by encouraging
students to present their own ideas
and research, the organization
hopes to reach its objective.

. « Through its activities, the group
hopes to show‘students what is ex-

pected of professionals in today’s
advanced industry. By participa-
ting in group activities, the stu-
dent can get a start in adjusting
to a job situation.

High hopes are found at the Uni-
versity’s student affiliate chapter,
but as Alexander said, “We are
still in planning stages. The pro-
gress we make will depend entire-
ly 'upon the cooperation and en-
thusiam of our members.”

RosenbIum’s
Piece Rapped

Editor, The Pitt News:

How anyone with any amount
of sense could take Mr. Rosen-
blum’s article “J.E.W.I.S.H.”
seriously is beyond me. Anyone
with “Inte1ligence” could easily
see his inttntions were merely in
jest. Anyone with “intelligence”
could see that he was merely mak-
ing a satire on the racial demands
of today’s monority groups, us-

ing “J.E.W.I.S.H.” as his example.

And no one with “intelligence”
would have the nerve to call any-
one “anti-semetic” on the has-
is of an evidently humerous and
fictitious article. ‘

I congratulate Mr. Rosenblum
for creating this interesting way
of ‘‘telling it like it is” without
the use of boring and repititious
facts. '

Process ’68

Invites All

Editor, The Pitt News:

The American student faces a
crisis. Presently, the whole educa-
tional process is one of “passsing
people.” We are told to memorize
and regurgitate the material we
are given. Our best students are

‘the ones who master this game
most effectively. At Pitt we all

work for our grades and are proces-

sesvout as “homogenized indivi-
duals’? (thank you, Ken Schuel-
er) prepared to join Levittown and
the American Way of Life.

_We of Process ’68 want to al-
leviate some ofgthe drudgery of
this academic cattle bin by‘hav-
ing students initiate their own re-
search-action groups dealing with
the pertinent problems of our day.
Education is more than cramming
for a grade. Education is a process

 

helping individuals

Process ’68 attempts to attain,‘

this goal. Small research groups 
determining their own methods, -'
speed, and goals, and working’ 75
closely within itself and with other E  
groups should ficilitate this educa-,‘ , ~ 
tional process. We invite everyone ’ W 
to come experience and experi- _

Students Hit
Biafra Story

Editor,The Pitt News; ’ A
In reference to the article in

the Wednesday Sept. 11 Pitt‘ News .‘ 

on the “resounding success” of the _

eight day Biafra marathon, we  

would like to let the students of

our university know that wefeel , lg. 

$225 is a rather disgraceful de-
monstration of “concern.” When -

we consider a student bodygof ‘q 

8000, not to mention the Saga food

workers, parents, and Oakland L 

businessmen who partook in this
drive, we don’t really understand
how your article could praise such
a meager sum. .

We found it in poor taste that

The Pitt News did not take a more _ S‘ 
objective position reprimanding   ,
the students. The article gave more  

attention to the people who en-
joyed the music than to the fact

that millions are starving in Bia- 
fra. Although everyone is grate- *
ful to the few who did contri-

bute, we would appreciate if if
The Pitt news would not assume
such apatronizing attitude in the
future!

she replied simply, “No telling

(She is attending a meeting of the

Society to Clothe Naked Gile,

If she doesn’t acquire a metro-

in an intricate pattern. The func-
tion of the work is a waterfall
since it is set up with a continu-
ous stream of water which trick-
les through the metal.

The ceramics portion of the ‘ex-
hibit was good. Several pieces of
pottery were among those works
displayed. A hooked rug and an_
embroidered panel were interest-
ing displays of the talent of the
artist.

The most impressive aspect of the
display was the vast range of me-
dia which was used by Mrs. Li-
vidini. Her different .techniques
show that she is an extremely ver-
satile artist.

Anyone who is interested in view-
ing this display of art work can

Provides Student

by BARRY J. SHLACTER,

By joining the National Stu-
dent Association, (NSA) Univer-
sity students automatically be-
came eligible for many services.
The most important of these ser-
vices are travel aids for student
travel. By purchasing your Interna-
tional Student Identification Card,
you may take advantage of low
priced air, bus, and train trips with-
in Europe. Inexpensive hotels, pen-
sions, hostels, and the job exchange
program are also available.

The U.S. National Student As-
sociation is cooperatively sponsor-
ing a program with the British and
Irish Governments whereby those
students who are selected are sup-
plied with an official entry per.-
mit enabling them to enter those
countries to look for employment.

SDS Cites Goals
In First Meeting

by JUDI GALARDI

“Students of a Democratic So-
ciety (SDS) is an association of
young people on the left. It seeks
to create a sustained community
of educational and political con-
cern; bringing together liberals
and radicals, activists and scholars
...It feels the urgency to put forth
a radical, democratic program
whose methods embody the demo-
cratic vision,” This is the defini-
tion of the SDS given in the pre-
amble of its National Constitution.

The Pittsburgh area chapter of
the SDS has not yet been recog-
nized by the National SDS, but ac-
cording to the Constitution, Article
3 states: “Any group of five or
more National SDS members may
start a chapter.”eOne member at
Tuesday’s meeting, which was the
groups first, proved this lack of re-
cognition by saying that he had
talked to one of the National mem-
bersanditold him he was from the
Pittsburgh chapter. The man re-
plied “What?”

Geoffrey Bauman, who was el-
ected secretary at the meeting
told of the work the SDS did this
summer. “We worked with the
farmers (those who were picket-
ing against the stores that sold
California Grapes) for a while,
but then left for political reasons.
The political reasons being that

‘ National Student Association

Travel Aid

In this way, the students can fin-
ance a visit to these countries,
which they might otherwise be un-
able to afford.

USNSA does not actually place
students in the jobs, but instead
provides briefings on what areas
and specific companies.in Eng-
land and Ireland will offer jobs
and how to go about obtaining
them. It is up to the individual
student, however, to follow through
and secure the actual job.

In addition to comprehensive job-
hunting information, students will
be given names of some companies
already contacted that are wil-
ling to employ American students
for the summer. Those students
who are interested in participating
in this program should leave their
names at the SG office, 305 SU.

Humphrey and Barr also backed
them.”

With the fourteen members pre-
sent, a few suggestions of what the
SDS could do were given. They
would like to do research on the
Board of Trustees here at the Uni-
versity to discover the types of
defense contracts they have with
the Government. Another propos-
ed plan was to show‘ the students
“what’s happening” to society.
They want to “pull out the men in
Pittsburgh who are doing every-
thing in Pittsburgh.” Finally, the

members want to find out “the.

relationship Pitt has with the land-
owners and businesses in Oak-
land.”

One point mentioned at the meet-
ing were the wages that students
are working for. “Students work

for ridiculous wages, but since ‘

they need jobs, they continue to
work. This not only keeps their
wages down, but the wages of peo-
ple who must support a fimily. ”

Although Geoffrey Bauman was
mentioned as the Secretary for the
Group, he is not to be consider-
ed a “leader” in the common
sense of the word. As one mem-
ber stated, “The members of the
group decide all.” When another
student declared that a leader was
needed, a third person replied,

that a “leader” would be represen- ‘

tative of a hierarcy of authority
and it would be against SDS prin-
ciples.

At the next meeting, the mem-
bers will make their decision on
which of the plans they want to
put into action. Any student is

invited to attend, but since the '

SDS hasn’t a definite meeting
place as yet, this information will
be printed as soon as it is obtain-
ed. '

Council on Crime and Delinquency
Commencis University Volunteers

by PAUL ST. JOHN

For the past two years. student
volunteers have assisted in tutor-
ing, arts and crafts. sports. and
discussion or singing groups in
the juvenile detention center.

Due to the success of last
year’s program. the Council on
Crime and Delinquency has made
recommendations that it be ex-
panded.

Superintendent of the Juvenile

Detention Home Robert Gilten- .

booth said that “without the ac-
tive volunteer program provided
by the community. especially the
University YMCA. the Detention
Home would be unable to have
children participate inlas many
wholesome and constructive ac-
tivities.”

James Robinson, director of the
Special S e r v i c e s Department,
feels that the efforts of the volun-
teers raises the morale of the chil-
dren and increases their coopera-
tion and desire to participate in
constructive activities.

The program is getting under
way again and more students are
needed to assist the regular staff.

2 Los Angeles’ Coliseum is so big, it makes Pitt Stadium look

"like a playpen. And when UCLA opens its football season there,
= the Coliseum packs in more people than voted for Barry Gold- i '
water in the last election. All of whom make more noise than
A the combined tonnage of World War‘II.

   
  
 
  

  
 

:Well, not exactly, but you do get the idea that UCLA has
_ -‘an advantage when it plays at home. And with nearly half of

-- the Panther starting team playing in their first
varsity game, it’s a point that needs to be consi-
dered. ‘

Only four of the Panther starters played in the
 Coliseum two ‘years ago. One of them, tri—captain
'? ; linebacker Ed Gallin, need be especially concern-
ed, He’s the only senior on an inexperienced de-
fense which lists seven sophomores and one
3 junior transfer from offense. Eddie has to worry

fabout holding the defense together until the sophs
 get ‘acclimated. He can’t allow himself to lose
his cool, but at the same time he can remember
his reactions to the Coliseum as a sophomore.

_ “Man, _that Coliseum’.s big,” he said, nodding for emphasis. “Just
stand there at the bottom and look up. It looks like every section is a
4 _;different color. You can sweat off five pounds just looking.”

UCLA Provides First Test For
Inexperienced Panther Gridders

by ART ROSENGARTEN

How good is this year’s Panther football team?

Tomorrow night under the lights of the Coliseum and the
eyes of thousands of West Coast gridiron fans, the 79th edition
' of the Pitt football will try to provide some sort of ananswer. ' 1

One thing that head coach Dave Hart knows for sure about his
young team is that they are not a 19 point underdog. “We haven’t been

favored in two years and I’m tired of being an underdog,” stated Hart,
who is beginning his third year at Pitt.

“All the 19 points proves is
that UCLA is a very fine football
team,” he continued. “This type
of margin makes me very mad.
I hope that the kids have pride

» enough to do something aboutit
starting with our showing at the
Coliseum.”

Be.bcm—Less Uclans Still
See Bright Grid Season

‘Tommy Prothro labels this
year ‘.‘the rebuilding year” 'and
is expecting a tough game against
the Panthers.

“Last year Pitt was, a tough,
sound fundamental team that was
loaded with sophomores who made
sopnomore mistakes.” explained

, Prothro, “No telling how far they

can go this season now that the
sophs have gained experience.”

But Prothro is not lacking in
talent to build with. Reggie Rob-
inson,fwho posted his sensational
9.1 clocking as a Texas prep sprint-
er, adds depth to an already star-
studded pair of split ends, Ron
Copeland and Harold Busby.

Sophomore tailback Mickey

Cureton is, as Prothro puts it,”

. not only a great runner,

but as good a blocking back now

as we’ve had at UCLA with the
possible exception of Mel Farr.”

And UCLA will also be boosted
by Junior College transfers Doug
Huff (6-3, 225, safetyman), Bruce
Bergey (6-4, 220 tight end), and
Jum Ford (6-0, 207, cornerman).

As a result there is no surpirse
that UCLA is the favorite in the
Coliseum against the Panthers, but
the Uclans don’t figure -to win
57-14 or 40-8 either. ‘

_UCLA has as much talent if not
more than last year’s 7-2-1, six-
teenth-ranked team, but less ex-
perience.

“Dave Hart - Pitt Football,”’
a weekly 10-minute wrap-up of
Panther football debuts Sunday
night at 11:10 p.m. on WIIC-
TV, Channel 11. Coach Hart, as
well as a varsity player and as-
sistant coach, will appear each
week to discuss the previous
day’s game. W

 

Pride is one thing that the new
Panthers have developed since they
began hitting last spring. Along
with the pride, the gridc/lers have
regained. their spirit and enthusi-

1 asm, something that was missing

last week.

But are the things going against" ,

the Panthers and for the point-
makers if the amount of inexperi:
enced players that Hart plans to
start. Of the 22 starters, only four
will be senior lettermen, while
the rest are split evenly between
sophomores and juniors.

The offense will be mostly up-
perclassmen. The only two start-
ing sophomores will be quarter
back Dave Havern and tailback
Denny Ferris. Joining those two
in the backfield will be juniors
Jeff Brown at fullback, and Joe
McCain at wingback.

The job of protecting mini-quar-
terback Havern’ will be entrust-
ed to a veteran line. Chuck Hutch-
ko will anchor the line, and he’ll
be flanked by guards Dave Man-
cuso and Greg Ellis. Rounding out
the starting five will be Art Alois
at tight tackle and George Rich-
ardseat the split tackle slot. The
ends are George Medich and Har-
ry “Skip” Orzulak, one of the tri-
captains. A '

Defense will bear the brunt of \

inexperience with ,9 out of the
starting 11 having little or no
experience. Only tri—captain Ed
Gallin, linebacker, and defensive

end Bob Ellis have had game

time at their positions.

The defensive secondary of
sophomores Bryant Salter and
Chuck Hall, and junior Jeff Barr,
an ex-quarterback, have only play-
ed together since fall camp. The
prowler, Dave Dibbley, a defen-
sive back last year, will try to
help out from his swing position.

The heralded duo of linebackers,
Ralph Cindrich and Lloyd Wes-
ton, join Gallin and Dibbley in
an attempt to stop the UCLA pow-
erful ground game. These four will
back up the front line of sopho-
mores Tom Porecca, defensive
end, tackles Bruce Harkiewicz
and John Stevens, and junior El-
lis. ‘

Hart hopes that his team will
prove the point - makers wrong

Saturday night and give him his ,'

first shot at being a favorite in

~ next week’s home .opener.

Varsity Soccer Squad   Strong Harriers Ready Fgr 
Journeys To Bucknell, Trian

Season Inaugural Set

Leo Bemis’ varsity soccer team begins the 1968 campaign
tomorrow at Bucknell, and with a few breaks they could come

home with their first win.

All of the healthy members of the squad looked ready in their fin-
al scrimmage Wednesday. and the booters looked like they were up

forthis one three days in advance.

Bemis relates, “We’ll be all
right if we can get everyone in
' there.”

The players he is concerned
about right now are halfbacks
Norm Roux and Bob Quinlin,
and fullback Cliff Arbes. The two
halfbacks are almost healed after

, lengthy enforced rests due to in-

jury, but Arbes pulled a leg mus-
cle in the final practice. Bemis
is hoping all three can start.

His first-string lineman for the
Bucknell game will be Bob Trex-
ler, Conference Lekoma, Randy
Dry, and Ron Bugaj. They will
be joined in the lineup by full-
backs Mike Schalk and Wayne
Kaiser. Rounding out the starters
are halfback Dave DiEmido and

‘ goalie Len Harmon.

Bemis sees no problems with
these men, but Harmon, the team’s
captain is -a bit worried about his
timing.

“He’s the nervous type. But,
he’s a competitor. I'm not concern-
ed about Len,.. Bemis mentions.

The one thing Bemis is con-
cerned about is the opposition.
The booters won an easy 3-0 de-

0 cision last fall over Coach Craig
Reynold’s Bisons.

“They should have an improv-
ed team,” says Bemis. “But,” he
adds, “They have had a few in-
juries.” - » ‘

Whatever Bemis says, his opti-
misms shows. At least somewhat
more than his assistant, Vince
Bartolotta.

Bemis and the players are confi-

The main reason for this con-

Lekoma Came to ‘Give’ 

by_ED CONLEY

- There is an ‘old’ saying in Conference Lekoma’s Botswania
that says “When you are a stranger, be quiet, see howthey
do things. Then, you can criticize. ”

This is the philosophy the new soccer sensation at Pitt _has

rbrought with him. He says it in
his won way: “I need to be part
of Pitt to explain Pitt.”

The African-native, who doesn’t
like to discuss ages, is a part of
Pitt. He is a key member of the
booters and feels that he really
is only a "single member of that
squad.

“One player doesn’t make a team.
they all do,” Lekoma says.

He feels that one thing can_ruin
a team —- “Some person who wants
to keep the ball to himself.”

The talented lineman says, “Give
and let Give.” '

This is what he plans to do this
fall. He wants’ to do the “giving”

:7 and ‘.‘let giving” here at Pitt for a

reason that has very little to do
with his game of “football.”

“I first went to Lincoln (a uni-
yersity in Eastern Pennsylvania)
for orientation. I wanted educa-
tion most of the time, so I come
here,” comments the booter.

He also mentions that here at
Pitt, along with his learning, he
can contribute something through
his ability in soccer. ,

This is an ability he is proud
to credit to his father's instruc-
tions. “He taught me,” Confer-
ence says. “You grow up playing
the game in Botswania. The talent’
is developing. It’s just like when
you always use one hand.” I
Lekoma uses his brain when he
plays his sport, along with his ab
ility. He has some ideas about
how the game should be played.
But, using that old sayingjfrom
home he feels that maybe, he
should be quiet.

     

    

" outs at Schenley Park. Simply, the
squad, instead of practicing at
._ Schenley Park, occasionally prac-
“' tices up the Stadium.

Mike also remarked, “The in-
tervals we run at the Stadium
help develop, our natural speed.
t helps us to get started fast and
0 keep the fast pace of a race.”
The tram has been running quar-

eter miles, half miles, and mile in-

tervals. Nolan commented that
when practicing at Schenley Park,
the squad is concerned mainly
with‘ ling distance running.

Mike doesn’t believe that the
squad is in tip-top shape just yet.
Saturday will be the first day that
everyone really exerts themselves,
according to Nolan. He also con-
firmed Jerry Richey’s status.

“He’ll be ready for them,” said
Mike. “Kent has a runner named

(Ed. Note: This article is the

A last in a series dealing with the

Warsaw Pact occupation of
Czechoslovakia. In the weeks
ahead this space will continue to
report on other Eastern European
nations. ‘

(Written during the occupation
of Czechoslovakia, this authentic
diary relates the frustration and
-indignation of a young Czech
watching the destruction of his
dreams).

3 August 24, I968
Dear’ Jon and Joel,

I am writing to you from
Czechoslovakia wh i c h is -occu-
pied. Today is the fourth day of
the occupation. I think that you
will be interested in the life and
ideas of our people. I am going
to tell you" how -I live the occupa-
tion. ’

 

On Wednesday morning my sis-
ter told me about the situation in
our country. I’ was so surprised
that I could not say anything. I
had tears in my eyes. Outside
were tanks and autos full of_ sol-
diers. All of the people were sur-
prised. Some of them even wept.

This aggression is the biggest
treason which I and the other
Czech people have known. It is
the biggest shame of the USSR. I
went out in the morning on Wed-
nesday and talked with the pri-
vates from the USSR who were in
the tanks. Some of them did not
know where they were, nor why.
Others said that in the USSR
there was a counterrevolution.
They were not right.‘ The Soviet
soldiers are not literate. They do
not think for themselves. They
kill many people, even children.

All of our people are very glad

that we can hear free radio. The

 Diary Shows Spirit of Czechs

_ people yell, “Dubcek — Svoboda

— Dubcek.” And they depend on
them. All of us believe that the
truth will be winning.

August 25, 1968

It is the fifth day of occupa-
tion. The new units of Soviet sol-
diers go to Czechoslovakia. The
soldiers of the Soviet Union and
some traitors arrest Czech intelli-
gence agents, and other_patriots.
The designations of the streets are
demolished. The soldiers are con-
fused. Sings read: “Moscow——War-
saw—Sophia—Berlin—Budapest.

The radio reports that there are
big demonstrations in towns of
the East German Democratic Re-
public. I think that there will be
revolutions in all the Socialist re-
publics wh i c h will overthrow
Breznev, Ulbricht, Zhivkov, Go-
mulka, Kadar, and other hated
leaders.

August 26, 1968

I saw the troops in my towx.
today. I stood near the road. The
column of Soviet soldiers halted
and a private yelled, “Hello,
friends.” He does not know that
he is an unwelcome guest.

August 27, 1968

The radio reported that our
leaders returned from the USSR.
All of the people waited to hear
President Svoboda and Alexan-
der Dubcek. In the afternoon we
knew the results. Everyone was
sad. Svoboda’s speech was not op-
timistic. Dubcek said that the na-
tion must be uniform. It must be
quiet.

The dealings in Moscow were
avbig setback for our nation. This
setback will not last long. I hope
that Czechoslovakia will lead the
other Socialist Republics. In my
lifetime the people of these coun-
tries will obtain democracy.

I know that in this. letter are a
lot of mistakes. I use the words
which I do not know and I look
for "them in the dictionary. I use
them because I want to say what
I feel. And I feel that this treason
will not be forgotten. At no time.

I do not know that the letter
will come to you. I hope it will.

Your friend,
Stefan
