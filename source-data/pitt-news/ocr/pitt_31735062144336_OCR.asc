KERR TELLS OE
SPIRIT AT FRONT

Dr. Hugh Thomson Kerr, pastor of
t-he Shadyside Preslbyt-erian Church,
described his cxperiieuces during a
three months’ stay on the French
battle front as a Y. M. »C. A. worker,
Thursday.
When greeted by the h-andclap he an-
nounced that the last time he had
heard that signal was from the Base
Hospital Unit No. 27 in F-rance. He
said in part:

“The American boys in France
want to come home, but not until the
Hun is beaten. The war will not -end
until we in tllle United States end it.
If Germany can put up such a great
ﬁght for a pagan cause, then we in
Armeri-cu can surely put up a str-onger,
better ﬁght for a noble -cause.”

Dr. Kerr received «great aiptpla-use
when, producing a tiny A-inerican
ﬂag, he said: “The whole spirit of
our ‘boys in France today is symbol-
ized -by this flag draped over t-he «pic-
ture of mother or sweetheart.” It
means ,mot-her, ‘home and liberty.

PITT DOING BIT 
FOR RED CROSS

In response to the call of the
American Red~CIross -for $100,000,000,
of which -sum the Pittsburgh di-strict
is asked to raise $4,000,000, the Uni-
versity of PittI.s'Il)l1'I’gh is carrying on a
campaign among the faculty and stu-
dents to help raise the necessary
funds. '

According to Miss Teagatrden and
Mrs. F. H. Lane, «who have c=harge of
the drive. at Pitt. donations are com-
ing in rapidly «from the 'me.mIb-ers of
the faculty, but the co-nt.riIbutivon~s -o.f
the students so. far t-h.is week have
been small. It is exepected, however,
that they will make their contribu-
tions before -the end of the week. The
drive, which began last Monday, May
20, ‘will ofﬁicially close, Monday, May
27. All contributions should «be in
by that time. ,

Red Cross inembers:h.i.ps are not ‘be-
ing soli-cited, and all that is ’be.in,g
asked is that as many as rpiossible con-
tribute and that such con-triibutions be
made through the University of Pitts-

ROWLAND DEATH
  DESCRIBED BY
MAX HANNUM

. Maxwell E. I-Iannum, EC.’ '19,
_’former assistant manager of the

PITT VVEEKLY, writes the follow-
ing acc-oun-t of the death of Harold
E. Rowland, Be. '20, while in the
service in Fran-ce:

“I suppose all tile Pi-tit folks will be
shocked to l-earn of the death of Har-
old Rowland, a freshman last year,
and a member of S. A. E. We were
-consi'dera’b.ly cut: up about it, becsause
we all thought so much of him and
it was the ﬁrst death of any of our

-death on his way back.

“It seemed that-one day Rollie was
with us, the next‘ day desperately ill
with spinal meningitis; the next day
on the road to recovery, and the next
day‘ dead. We had favorable reports
from him lately, and when the news
of «his death came it was sudden and
absolutely unexpected by the enlisted
men. _

“A.kind of gloominess settled on
the whole camp\im‘med-ieately, for each
of us :had taken a personal interest
We -like-d «to ‘hear the c-on-
stant reports of his grit and admired
him for his good ﬁght.

in Rollie.

Indeed, we
felt like patting ourselves on the back
Ibecause we had in our unit a ‘fellow
of such stuff. For the kid suffered
terrib.ly. He ‘had what Ijciihzep headv nurse
'EaiIecr '-i§rpic‘a1i (fa‘S .9 or -s‘i;Iii?a.I13.ne‘nts+
gitis, than vwhicli no -other disease is
‘h der to combat: and more painful
t the suﬁ’erer.’ Nurses and doctors
alike testiﬁed to his grit and his de-
termination. Tln nurses who were
attending him ‘absolutely refused -to
be relieved. His physician, ordered
away by headquarters, was reluctant
to-go, despite the fact that just as
good care would be taken -of him, and
just as mu-ch scientiﬁc aid given him
as if he were present. ‘

“\Rollie was buried today with ﬁt-
ting ceremonies; in fact an -old army
man with the unit said that he had

never seen equa1~honors accorded a

private at his burial service before.
The casket, ‘draped with the ﬂag, was
set in front of’ the hospital and sur-
rounded with beautiful ﬂoral pieces,
gifts of the several divisions of the
personnel. Rev. Mr. Smith, the Y.
M. C. A. representative, read the
service, the casket was placed in an
amlbulance, and, led by a ﬁring squad,
the m.arch t-o the cemetery started.
Every possi-ble member of the unit
was in the formation. The C. O. in
person commanded the detachment.
N-urses, officers and men, alike, min-
gled to pay -their last respects. We
were much impressed by the respect-
ful attitude of the French people. Not
a man, no matter how ragged -and
down-a‘n:d-out looking, failed to re-
move his hat as the corpse passed.

“The detachment formed in a
square about the grave, -the last rites
were accomplished, three" rounds were
ﬁred, taps sounded, and Rollie’s body
was lowere-d into a grave which may
be surrounded by many more before
the end of the war. There weren’t
many dry eyes in the crowd.

“This eve-ning Ca roseibush was
planted on the gr.ave, and as long as
we are here that inound will not be-
come untidy from lack of attention.

“Ray Huff, who is in an ofﬁccrs'
training school not far from ‘here,
came over as soon as he heard of
Rollie’s death. Jack F.ryor and he
both rather took charge of things, ar-
ranging for pallbearers, etc.”
