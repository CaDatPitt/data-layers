Doubts emerge over student inﬂuence

Amy Friedenberger and
Phyllicia Leavitt
News Stajf

College students shed their_ image
of political apathy this Tuesday
when they went to Harrisburg to
lobby against the proposed budget -
cuts in education.
But will it make a difference?
Faced with tuition increases

and potential program cuts,
students are riled due to Republi-
can Gov. Tom Corbett’s proposed
budget reductions in higher
education funding. The cuts, part
of the Republican govern0r’s ﬁrst
budget, amount to almost $900
million in education spending and

would reduce Pitt’s $185 million
appropriation by more than half,
to $80.2 million. The appropria-
tion was less than 10 percent of
Pitt’s budget this year, and would
be less than 5 percent under Cor-
bett’s plan. ‘ .

So students have written letters

and lobbied legislators. But a Pitt
political science professor said the
efforts might not work, because of
what Pitt students did at the polls
ﬁve months ago.

Professor Susan Hansen said
students might not have as much
an effect on the legislative process
as hoped for, “because they don’t -
vote.” . I I _
“Legislators respond to people

who are willing to make an effort
to express their opinion,” she said.
“Students don’t have a lot of an
effect because they don’t vote in
large numbers, and certainly not
in the primaries.”

In the November 2010 general
elections, only 17.14 percent of
4,252 registered voters came to the
polls in Ward 4 District 8 —— which
covers much of Oakland. Ward 4
District 14, another Oakland dis-

_ trict, had a slightly better turnout I

at 17.43 percentof 1,377 voters.
Despite this lackluster voting

record, several of the legislators
who met with students expressed
support for the students’ effort to
get involved. ' - A V ' -

State Rep. Marguerite Quinn,
R—Doylestown, said in an e—mail
that she does not support the bud-
get proposal in its present form.

_ “I appreciate the fact that the
students took time away from
their studies to make the long trek
-to Harrisburg‘ to speak with me
and my colleagues,” she said. “I
met with kids from several differ-
ent schools and campuses, and
my opposition to the deep cuts in
higher education was conﬁrmed.”

Hansen also had issues with
the budget cuts.

“[The government] can’t bor-

- row the money. They can’t steal it.

They can’t print it. So they have to

24-hour 2
dance
to fund
research

Phyllicia Leavitt
For The Pitt News

 

Although recent weather_ reports
predict showers tonight, students
will stay outside for a full 24 hours

- to dance for cancer research.

About 100 student contestants
will challenge themselves to keep
moving from 6 p.m. tonight to 6
p.m. Saturday outside on Bigelow
Boulevard. The Greek Week’s An-
nual Dance Marathon generates
proceeds to beneﬁt the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

Thunderstorms might hit Pitts-
burgh during the marathon, and
there is at least a 50 percent chance
of rain throughout the contest.

Although it’s too early to know
the ﬁmdraising amount, senior
Matthew Balsbaugh has high
expectations for the Pitt Dance
Marathon.

“Usually PDM raises $50,000
every year, but now, with more
organizations getting involved, we
hope to surpass that number,” he
said. _-

The Greeks hope this event will
push them toward completing their
contract with UPCI, which they ’
signed in 2005 to raise $500,000
to go toward a lung and thoracic
cancer research laboratory in Pitts-
burgh. So far, they have passed the
$400,000 mark. ' -

This year, the Greek community
plans on crossing the threshold.

“I think with this money, we’ll
be ﬁnally hitting that mar ,” said
senior. Nicole Elfner, one of the V
event’s organizers. I

Family members inspire

Tegan Hanlon
Staff Writer

Last June, the ﬁght against cancer gained a
lot more meaning for Elizabethjoyce.

After her mother was diagnosed with a
brain tumor, Joyce realized how important
fundraising is to ending the disease, and
she redoubled her efforts in Pitt’s Relay For
Life.

Although the Pitt sophomore had par-
ticipated in the event before, her mother’s
diagnosis drove Joyce to become this year’s
top individual fundraiser at Pitt for the an-
nual event that takes place today.

“Seeing ﬁrsthand the effects cancer can
have on someone is an eye-opening experi-
ence,” Joyce said. “You see what it can do to
a person and a community. The Relay calls
attention to the disease.”

Joyce started reaching out for donations
in late February, sending out an e-mail to
her family and friends one night. The mes-
sage asked them to donate to the American
Cancer Society in support of Pitt’s Relay
For Life.

When she woke up the next morning,
Joyce had more than $500 in donations. By
the end of the day, as her e-mail traveled
around the Internet, she had raised "$1,500
in online credit card donations.

Money poured in over the next two

months asjoyce raisednearly $3,700 —
$200 more than her goal — toward the
$65,000 total brought in by the rest of the
event’s 1,000 participants. ‘
]oyce’s efforts and those of all the teams
participating in the event will culminate in
tonight’s Relay For Life, which is hosted by
Pitt student group Colleges Against Cancer.
About 100 teams of varyingwsize — ’

~ more than 1,000 students total — will

camp out around the path between the
Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Memo-
rial Chapel from 5 p.m. today to 8 a.m.
Saturday. For 15 hours, at least one par-
ticipant from each team — many of whose
members have personal connections to the
disease’s victims — will walk a preset path
to help raise money to ﬁght cancer. \

Taylor McKelvie, who co-chairs the I
Relay For Life committee, said the money
thatJoyce and other participants gathered
will go to all aspects of cancer prevention,
including treatment programs, research
and education.

The teams are encouraged to have one
participant walking the path from the start
of the Relay until 8 a.m. Saturday to repre-
sent that cancer never sleeps, junior Kelsey
Perkins said.

‘ Perkins, the other co-chair of the Relay
For Life committee, was only 12 when her
father died of cancer. She said that experi-

with a daily newspaper. Responsibilities include

managing a geographic territory, face—to~face
sales and prospecting for new business.

ence was a big motivator to participate in
the Relay.

“I also see it as a way of advocating
healthy lifestyles in general — here you see
a-lot of people smoking and baking in the
sun,” Perkins ‘said. ' - ’

Personal ties to the disease is a common

theme among Relay organizers.

The chair of the committee,Jade Holtz-
inger, also lost a family member to the
disease.

Holtzinger, who is now a senior, was

- only a sophomore when her mother died of
cancer. She said she then immediately took
the chair position of the committee.

“[The Relay] is so important to me on a
personal level,” she said.

Although the American Cancer Society
— which sponsors the event — distributes
most of the funds, McKelvie, a senior, said
UPMC will receive a large portion of the
research funds raised at Pitt.

President of Colleges. Against Cancer
Rachel Strittmatter said the Relay For "Life
concept began in 19 85 when a Washington
surgeon, Dr. Gordy Klatt, wanted to ﬁnd

' a way to raise money for the American.
Cancer Society. V

“He literally walked for 24 hours and
had people sponsor him,” the senior said.
“Since then it has just spread — communi-
ties do it, high schools and now colleges.”

‘students to fight   cancer

The Relay For Life has now transformed
into an event of food, games, DJs and root
beer pong. “Beating the Odds” is the theme
for Friday’s “Vegas-style” Relay, at which
more than 1,000 people will set up tents
for their overnight stay on the Cathedral
Lawn. The plans also include a midnight
scavenger hunt and the Ms. Relay competi-
tion. '

Last year, Ms. Relay, a contest in which
where male participants dress up as female
models and walk around Oakland with do-
nation cups for an hour, raised more than
$800, Perkins said.

“This year we’re going to dress them up
like show girls,” she said. “Glittery make-
upland all.” _

Perkins said most Relay teams hold
their own fundraisers at their tent sites to
help Pitt reach its goal.

Team Homo Sapiens, co-captained
by sophomores Emily Rowe and Brianna
VanArsdale, plan to raise money by selling
non-alcoholic “mocktails” from their tent.

“You can’t have Vegas without a bar,”
Rowe said. -

The 11—person team, whose mantra‘ is to
“support human equality and end suffering
for all people,” has raised more than $500
so far through two tabling sessions in Tow-
ers Lobby and a bake sale in Posvar.

take it out of someone else’s hide,” Hansen
said.

State Rep. John Bear, R—Lancaster, said
that Pitt students did a good job advocating
for Pitt.

With the state budget of $27.3 billion,
cuts will have to be made, state Rep. Mike
Reese, R—Mount Pleasant, said.

“We’re facing some diﬂicult times,” Reese
said. “There is a budget cut of 52 percent to
higher education. I think that some of that
should be restored. Not all, but some.”

The most inﬂuential part of lobbying is
the personal connection with legislators not
available through public demonstrations
and press conferences, Hansen said.

Paul Supowitz, vice chancellor for
Governmental Relations, said the Pitt Day in
Harrisburg tradition helps “personalize the
issue” students might have with legislators.

“Democracy is "not a spectator sport. It
works best when everyone participates,”
Sen. Robert Robbins, R—Greenville, said in
an e-mail. '

Students who lobbied in Harrisburg
remained optimistic that their efforts will
inﬂuence the result of the ﬁnal budget.

Sophomore Rich White, a political
science major, acknowledged that college
students are generally known for being apa-
thetic, but that makes this week’s lobbying

effort of students stand out even more.

“I think the legislators are pleasantly sur-

age can come and do that, it shows that Pitt
is training them to be able to engage with
people this way.”

“Legislators tend to listen most carefully
to those who listen and vote,” Supowitz said.
Supowitz also said, however, that stu-

them is most effective.

“And don’t forget, for every one student,

Molly Stieber is conﬁdent that the legisla-
tors listened to the concerns of the students,
and that the cuts in the ﬁnal budget won’t be
as severe.

“Our budget is subject to be cut every
year,” Stieber said, adding that students
might forget that.

Pitt’s appropriation has been cut six
times in the past 10 years.

Stieber described this year’s Pitt Day in
Harrisburg as “bittersweet.”

“It’s great that so many students were
there, but it took until this year’s budget to

The solution at hand

Would you trade hairy palms
for restful legs? Well, according
to AOL News, those suffering
from Restless Legs Syndrome
—— a neurological disorder which
causes an uncontrollable urge
to move~one’s body, especially
during sleep —- can potentially
reduce their symptoms by means
of manual stimulation. Mastur-
bating has provided relief to
at least a small number of RLS
patients’ conditions, according
to a new case study out of Bra-
zil and an RLS expert quoted in
the article. But doctors caution
those who might delight at this

news — a commonly observed’

side effect is overactive hand
syndrome.

Heist we can believe in

Politicians often fall short of
representing the electorate, but
on rare occurrences that rela-
tionship can ﬂip. The Associated
Press reports that after a string
of bank robberies in Austria, au-
thorities suspect a man they say
walked into banks with not only
a weapon, but also a mask of Ba-
rack Obama. Police suspect the
45-year-old German man ofhav—
ing participated in seven heists

since 2008. But although we.

never condone armed theft, we
shouldn’t judge him too harshly
—— all in all, he was only looking
for change.

That smell ain’t the pollen

We’d bet if Sigmund Freud were
asked to psychoanalyze America,
he’d likely retort “anal retentive”
— or at least he wouldafter hear-

ingthis story. In March, the city of —

Oak Ridge, Tenn., attempted to
cite a male resident for present-
ing a deﬁmct toilet as a specialty
porcelain ﬂowerpot on his front
lawn. On March 31, a municipal
judge ruled in favor of the amateur
toiletbowl landscaper, calling the
city’s deﬁnition of rubbish overly
“broad,” according to the Knox-
ville News Sentinel. Whatever the
details of the mysterious case of
the ﬂowerpot commode, at least
we can rest assured its owner uses
homegrown fertilizer.

Lady with scissors

It appears’ that Al Gore has yet
another formidable adversary.
Yes, his purported brainchild,
the Internet, has again become
embattled, and this time the sus-
pect is in her 70s and living in the
country of Georgia. According to
the Associated Foreign Press, an
elderly woman went digging for
scrap metal on March 28"and end-
ed up hitting a major ﬁber—optic
cable. As a result of the damage
she caused to the cord, most of
Georgia and neighboringArmenia
went offline for nearly 12 hours.
The woman is potentially facing
three years in prison. But her fu-
ture isn’t as bleak as one might
think — our own sources tell us
her feats have caught the interest
of the Iranian government.

Avoid creating society of  
passive—aggressive tweeters

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

A ﬁinny thing happens when you’ve
reached the end of your rope: You
stop caring whetherranyone thinks
you’re a decent person and instead
revert to basic instinct. ”

This happened to me last week,
during my millionth hour on the
fourth ﬂoor ofHillman Library. Itwas
getting late and I hadn’t really eaten.
A couple started talking loudly at a
set of nearby computers, and with-
out thinking, I turned and shushed
them. It came out as a horrible hiss.
They looked at me in shock; Iblushed,
turned back to my computer screen
and tried to pretendlikethe librarian-
esque shush hadn’t come from me.

Once my elevated blood pressure

' stopped deafening my perceptions,

I realized that I had just done some-
thing amazing: The people weren’t
talking anymore. In fact, they had
left.

I don’t condone chasing people
out of the library, and I don’t think

hissing at people is an appropriate
way to demonstrate frustration. But.
the episode did get me thinking: What
if everyone started being just a little
bit braver‘? I mean every day — po-
litely, withoutwaitingfor their blood
sugar to drop to dangerous.levels.

' Especially as the stress of ﬁnals ap—,

proaches, what if everyone started

speakingup before somethingdrives A
them crazy? Would we startfeeling a _

little bit happier‘?

This generation’s getting passive.
It might bean easy cop-out, but I’ll
blame it on the Internet. Instead

of confronting issues head-on, we ‘

Tweet about it. I’m not making this
up. In the past couple of months,
I’ve heard numerous ‘stories about
people sending out Tweet blasts
about roommate and co-worker is-
sues. The situation worsens when
the offensive-Twitteringis inevitably
discovered by its subjects— days of
rage accumulated in text, blackening

' an individual’s name. Instead of put-

ting our problems online, we should
deal with them. Instead ofTweeting
about the annoying people in the li-

brary, we should take the initiative
and ask them to please lower their
voices, thanks.

I’ll readily admit that I’m as pas-
sive—aggressive as the next person.
Maybe even more so. I keep a detailed
feelings journal about all the things
that are bothering me (perhaps
only just a step up from a Twitter
account).

What is it that makes me so re-

— luctant to confront issues head-on?

I don’t know, being a girl might have
something to do with it. I don’t really
want_to makeit about gender — I
think there are passive-aggressive
dudes too. But the other day, I hap-

pened to be complaining to a male . .

friend about some kind of roommate
issue, somethingthat by all accounts
could be solved easily.

“Wait,” my friend said. “Instead
of letting all this build up, why don’t
you just ask them about it?”

I realized that I didn’t know why
I hadn’t tried.

we do have control over something.
After 16 years of school, We’re used

to following orders. We’re handed a
syllabus at the beginning of each se-
mester, essentially telling us how we
are going to spend our time each day.
Followingthrough on that is still up to

- us, but if we don’t do what We’re told,

there are consequences. It makes us

I might digress, butI thinkthis is
all related. The thing about speaking
up is, oftentimes, people agree with
you. In the wake of the library and
the roommate incidents, I’m trying to

GOOD GRIEF

Bus talks require equal concessions

Mike Good
Columnist

It’s no surprise that negotiations be-
tween County Executive Dan Onorato
and Amalgamated Transit Union Lo-

cal 85 President Patrick McMahon A

to restore service cuts faltered again
this week. . '
The fundamental difference be-
.tWeen the two parties is that, whereas
Onorato wants a long—terrn plan to
assuage the Port Authority’s woes
before restoring service, McMahon
wants to ﬁnd a short-term’ solution
to debt issues and restore service

, as quicklyas possible, according to
the Pittsburgh—Tribune—Review. As  ..

searched for the now—deceased 500,
I wondered what the future holds for
the Port Authority. A
A good public transportation sys-
tem is like economic adrenaline. Buses
shuttle workers and consumers into

and around the city, physically allow‘-;

ing supply and demand to join forces.
Withbus cuts, people lose the potential
to shop and work in different neigh-
borhoods, and the end result is that
the government loses money. Make no
mistake: Students and universities are
some of the strongest economic pipe-
lines in this city. Inhard money terms,
Chancellor Nordenberg’s 2009 Eco-
nomic Impact Report demonstrated
their grave importance — University-
wide, $1.74 billion was inﬁised into
the local economyin2008, $246 mil-
lionofthat coming directlyfrom Pitt’s

.27,000 students. And in my opinion
much of this spending wouldn’t have '

been possible without access to an
eflicient bus system, as Pitt and Car-
negie Mellon haven’t been paying
Port Authority millions each year to
allow “free” student access for noth-
ing. It concerns me that not only will
bus cuts threaten the local economic

cuts will force undeserving students
to pay the same transportation fee for
potentially lesser service. We are not
the cause of this trouble.

But we are fortunate as students.
Although the route cuts affect us, I

i don’t think anyone will reconsider

attending Pitt or drop out of school be-
cause the commute to class is too dif-
ﬁcult. Students lived in Lawrenceville
before an Oakland-Lawrenceville bus
route was established. But the same
does not always apply tosomeone who
commutes from one neighborhood

to work in another. The possibility '

of buses becoming less ‘frequent will
make employees seriously reconsider
working far from home.
. ..I don’tunderstandwhatthe priori-
ties of our city and state government
are. All I seem to hear these days are
“more jobs’ ’ and “less debt.” But I pay
my taxes with thehope that my elected
oflicials will spend this money intel-
ligently.

What Pittsburgh needs to have are
simple bus routes with central hubs.

. Is it necessary to have six bus stops
9 along Forbes and Fifth avenues in an

eight—block stretch, even when taking
into account the high population of
Oakland riders? I’m just astudent, but
I know other people who are equally
quizzical when it comes to our buses
and the way our money is being uti-
lized.

At this point, I’m frustrated. Pub-

lic transportation is a good thing,’
' and something many citizens would

consider a right. Port Authority cuts
carbon emissions by reducing the
amount of CO2 spewed from cars.
And since 2010, Port Authority has
begun to employ 28 hybrid vehicles
to increase its eﬂiciency and further
reduce emissions, accordingto a Port
Authority fact sheet.

« It’s time to get these buses run-
ning. I need some transparency from

Onorato’s “long-term” solutions, solu-
tions that don’t force lopsided con-
cessions. Realize that the ATU has
proposed wage freezes and salary
cuts that, according to the Tribune
Review, would save Port Authority
$16 million. But despite this, Port
Authority and _Onorato want more:
$20 million in cuts and $10 million
in increased revenue, according to
the Tribune-Review.

Port Authority is allegedly set to
carry a $60 million structural deﬁcit
this year. It is also the 11th largest pub-
lic transportation system in the coun-

try. I accept that some unions demand
more beneﬁts than they sometimes
deserve, but where I see one party
making concessions and compromis-
ingto keep the buses running, Isee the
other immovable and deaf.

It’s troubling to think that Onorato
was our alternative to Tom Corbett as
governor. Ifwe are really a democracy,
then I think it’s time our elected of-
ficials take the time to listen and get
some real results.

To the Editor,

Brendan Sullivan’s article yesterday was full of glaring errors, and Pitt
students deserve the corrections. Sullivan attempted to demonize the State

literally 8,000 percent higher than the true amount, as evidenced by The

Huffington Post.

Next, Sullivan claims Israel is an obstacle to peace. He couldn’t be more
wrong. Israel consistently attempts to make peace, but the Palestinians have
always declined. Peace initiatives were extended in 1937, 1947, 1967, 1979, 1995,

Neil Hamburger and Todd
Barry with Brendon Walsh
Spring Value Tour 2011
Saturday at 10 p.m.

The Smiling Moose
412-431-4663

Tickets: $20

21+

Comedian Neil Hamburger thinks
most of today’s stand—up acts
suck. ‘
“They come out dressed like
slobs with mustard or ketchup
down their trousers, and you get

a half-an-hour monologue about .

a guy sitting on a toilet seat,” an
in-character Hamburger said.
“And generally a half an hour into
this monologue, you get the weak-
est joke you’ve ever heard in your
life.”

The stand-up artist with a
cult following plans to buck the
aforementioned norm this spring
alongside his current partners in
comedic crime, Todd Barry and
Brendon Walsh. When the three
perform at The Smiling Moose on
Saturday, each performer will bring
his own brand of humor to create
a decidedly unconventional per-
formance.

“They’re real showmen,” Ham-
burger said of Barry and Walsh.
“They take the time to put on a
nice shirt, nice shoes  that kind of
thing, and actually tell somejokes
and keep it entertaining and put on
a professional show.”

Hamburger’s comedic contrari-
anism, however, has often incited
polarized reactions to his work —
or, at the very least, perplexity.

In Pittsburgh last November,
for instance, Hamburger opened
for Tim and Eric’s “Awesome Tour,

Greatjobl” performance with pur—.

posefully ill-timed and poor—taste
jokes about Michael Jackson, Me-
tallica members’ haircuts and the
general disrespect he thought the
audience was showing him. Most
people understood thehumor, but
a few remained confused.

This was, of course, hardly an
isolated incident.

“I think the best show of his I

saw was at afestival in Dublin,” Bar-
ry said -— he and Hamburger have
crossed paths a number of times
over the years. “Half the people in
the audience hated him and half
the people loved him, so it was a
spectacle on and offstage.”

In addition to his stand—up
work, eight comedy albums and
television appearances with Tim
and Eric and comedian Tom Green,
Hamburger recently sang as a guest
vocaliston a 7-inch single, “Ameri-
can Exports,” by Australian punk
group the Hard—Ons.

“I get asked by these lowlifes,
these degenerates to do records for
them,” Hamburger said. “And I turn
them down. In the case of the Hard-
Ons, they’re very nice guys and I
like what they’re trying to do.”

All the comedians in Hamburg-
er’s circle boast a diverse set of in-
terests. Todd Barry, for instance,

has a passion for acting, which

eventually landed him a part as
Mickey Rourke’s 9—to-5 manager,
Wayne, in the acclaimed 2008
drama “The Wrestler.”

“I dabbled in it during college,”
Barry said of acting. “I guess it’s just
nice to mix things up.”

Make no mistake, however: For
Barry, acting is no substitute for
comedy.

“I like doing stand—up,” he
said. “I consider myself a come-
dian above everything else, but
it’s good to have other projects to
break it up.”

When he isn’t involved in mov-
ies or television shows like Adult
Swim’s “Delocated” and FX’s
“Louie,” Barry dishes out jokes
that leave listeners wondering if
he’s commending or condemning
the subjects.

“There is a downside to every

city,” he quipped on the “Late Show 4

with David Letterman” in 2009.
“And the thing about New York is
that you will get arrested for crimi-
nal activity.”

Accompanying Hamburger and
Barry on the tour is Brendon Walsh,
an up—and-coming comedian who’s
as much their fan as he is their col-
league.

“Neil and Todd are psychos,”
said Brendon Walsh. “I’m just some
guy trying to make his way  I am
a fan of both of those guys, at risk

April 8, 2011 I The Pitt News I www.pittneWs.com

l\I—eil Hamburger a cham o ion of tastelessness

of sounding insincere.”
Walsh’s recent projects include

‘ work on a six—part series on HBO ‘

Canada called “Funny as Hell,”
“John Oliver’s New York Stand-Up
Show” on Comedy Central and an
appearance on “Conan.”

“I thoughtl saw a couple of teen-
age girls checking me out,” Walsh
said injhis stand-up performance
on “Conan” last November. “But

\ when I passed them, I heard oneof

them telling her friend, ‘There goes
your boyfriend Sheila, hahaha!’ 
I’m not Sheila’s boyfriend!”

“I’ve been a fan of Conan since
he started,” Walsh said. “I was
the third comedian on the show,
and it’s deﬁnitely a feather in my
cap.” _

You might expect the comedi-
cally forward—thinking Walsh and

. Barry to be social media-savvy, but

you can also ﬁnd the decidedly old-
fashioned Hamburger taking jabs
at the likes of Axe body spray and
Taco Bell via Twitter.

“It’s certainly better than jog-
ging,” Hamburger said of Twitter.
“I don’t know if you’ve tried jog-
ging, but that’s very, very unpleas-
ant.”

Kennedy Thompson’s band plays all

his favorite styles of music - fulﬁll-

ing a childhood dream of his.
Today, Thompson’s Erie-based

collective One World Tribe boasts ‘

an eclectic lineup of 12 regular musi-
cians and occasional guests, with a
repertoire encompassing hip—hop,
reggae, funk and Latin.

“The whole concept was that we

would bring many different styles
together that were related in some
way,” Thompson said. “At the very
least, I wanted very diverse [people]
with a strong grasp on [the styles],
or to ﬁnd a master in one of those
styles.”

Growing up in Detroit, Thomp-

' son was inﬂuenced by the music he

listened to ——. especially Santana
- and his cousin, who played the

drums. His interest in perform— .

ing only increased when he began
studying music himself.

“I wanted to be able to play a lot
of what I liked in different genres,”
Thompson said. “Putting a lot of
genres under one roof,_so to speak.
It took me a year and a halfto get
the right members.”

Band member Frank Singer, who
plays guitar, keyboard and drums,

The members of One World Tribe draw from a wide array of genres and cultures:

had brieﬂy spoken to Thompson in 1993 when ~

the two met in Pittsburgh. Singer received a
call from Thompson two years later. “We’re
staring rehearsal,” Thompson said. From
there, the band kicked off.

Part of OWT’s mission is to conﬂate dif-
ferent genres, tastes and musicians. Singer
believes the band’s continued solidarity un-
derscores its major theme: coexistence.

“Our backgrounds are very different,”
Singer said. “So we have managed to coexist
things that many people in this country argue
can’t coexist, like our religious and spiritual
backgrounds. But as for topics [in our music]
we have things from love to peace and political
freedom and diversity and everything else.”

At ﬁrst, the group performed covers of the
bands that inspired them, and it later moved
into composing its own music. Thompson said
the process is different for every song. Some-
times everyone contributes, and sometimes
only one person writes a song. But OWT has
never had to sit down and discuss what mes-

. sages may come through in their music.

“It’s kind of always been understood,”
Thompson said. “We want to play music that
uplifts man. Music that brings people togeth-
er, because music is a universallanguage.”

Member Ron Williams, aka Preach Free-
dom, stressed that even though there’s “no
discrimination” about song topics inthe band,
they try to make their music family-friendly
and uplifting. In other words, instead of just
complaining about issues in their songs, they
try to push for solutions, he said.

‘Williams has also taken a strong liking to
teaching in classrooms as a guest musician.

liams is talented with multiple instruments,
playing “anything I put my hands on.”

“I’m always in communities working with
children, -since I know this is a gift that can
help people,” he said. Referring to the re-
demptive power art held for him when he was
surrounded by gang violence on the street,
Williams said, “I came up in the ’80s and ’9os, ,
so music saved my life. And to show -people
there’s other things they can do artistically,
I talk to them.” 7

Music is a powerful tool that allows people
to “forget,” he said. _

-“In this diverse country of ours, when it
comes to music, people don’t mind a person’s
background,” he said. “Music doesn’t care
who you are or where you’re from. It has al-
lowed me to ﬁt with people. People listen to
you and I recognize that. I try to use music
for humanitarian reasons.”

 FOOTBALL

Offense, defense improng under Graham in spring

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ‘ Writer

After a slow start for the offense at
this spring’s football camp, the Pitt
football team is ﬁnally starting to
show serious signs of improvement
on -new head coach Todd Graham’s
new “high octane” offense.

The offense showed its ﬁrst tan-
gible signs of improvement during
last Saturday’s scrimmage against
the defense. It was a welcome sign
after that same defense dominated
the offensive squad in a previous

g scrimmage.

It seems that the team has ad-
justed better acclimated to Graham’s
new up -tempo style, but Graham said
there’s still plenty of room for im-
provement.

“We’ve got enough of our system

-. in. They understand what we’re do-

ing, and they’ve gotten better,” Gra-
ham said. “I think that’s the way it
should be — it should go back and
forth. That tells you that you have a
good team out there.”

In the scrimmage over the week-

' ‘ end, quarterback 'I‘ino Sunseri found

receiverMikeShanahan onazo-yard
play action pass in the early going
before Sunseri handed the ball off

to running back Ray Graham for a
20-plus yard gain to give the start-
ing offense momentum on its ﬁrst
drive.

The coaching staff has been
switching the offensive line around
frequently at camp, looking for the
right ﬁve—man combination. And now
the coaches believe they might have
found senior Alex Karabin’s replace-
ment at center with Chrisjacobson.

“I think we are ﬁne with where
we are, but it is something that will
take repetition,” Graham said. Ithink

Jacobsonwillbe the centerinthe end,
but he still needs to get ayear’s worth
of snapping between now and Au-
gls 33

While the offensive line is some-
what in limbo, the receiving corps
have been one of the brightest spots
for the Panthers’ offense at this early
stage in the new system. ,

The receivers are going to be

counted oninthe offenseto runmore
deep routes than usual to stretch
out opposing defenses as opposed
to previous and more conservative
offenses under former head coach
Dave Wannstedt.

. “We’re going to take shots down
the field,” Pitt wide receivers coach
Mike Norvell-said. “One of the things

I’m really encouraged about over the
last three or four practices, is the
number of vertical shots that we’re
completing. Now I’m seeing receivers
going up to compete when the ball is
inthe air.” '

Norvell has seen junior Mike
Shanahan beginningto shine for the
Panthers at receiver after ﬁnishing
second on the team in both recep-
tions with 43 and yards,589.

“He has separated himselfas a
guy who’s going to be a great leader
on this football team,” N orvell said.
“He is going to be a guywe can count

.on for big play capability.”

Meanwhile, fellow receiver Devin
Street has been improving his game
during the off—season and is develop-
ing into a good passing option for
quarterback Tino Stmseri.

“Devin Streetis continuing to buy
in[to the offense] and become a bet-
ter route runner,” N orvell said. “He’s

working on the little things. He is a,

very explosive player.”

Norvell’s unit has experienced
some injuries, but the receivers are
ﬁnally starting to get on the ﬁeld to
work together.

“Cam Saddler has been a little
nicked through spring ball,” Norvell
said Tuesday ofhis injured junior re-

ceiver. “There was a time today you
see him get the ball on the perimeter
and the explosiveness and quickness
is something that is exciting to see.”

Though the Pitt defense took a
licking from the offense in the last

scrimmage, ithas also looked strong ‘

this spring while also undergoing a
schematic adjustmentwith employs
three defensive linemen instead of
four last season. .

“My excitement naturally is be-
cause of the potential I’ve seen from
day one until now in the defensive
linemen,” defensive line coach Paul
Randolph said.

Seniors Chas Alecxih and Myles
Caragein are continuing Pitt’s recent
tradition of maintaining one of the
top defensive lines in the Big East.

Alecxih- is now playing defensive
end in the new defense after work-
ing as a defensive tackle the past two
seasons and recorded a career high
7.5 sacks last season in his ﬁrst year
as a starter.

“Chas Alecxih is highly explosive
and has had a great spring so far. He’s
been making plays in the backﬁeld
and is working hard at individual
technique,” Randolph said. “Myles
Caragein, my senior nose guard, has
done a really good job progressing

back from his injury last fall and is
doing a great job this spring.”

Randolph’s two seniors will as-
sume leadership roles with the grad-
uation of star defensive ends Greg
Romeus andjabaal Sheard.

“Those are my two leaders,” Ran-
dolph said of Alecxih and Caragein.

Pitt’s defensive line is also very
solid, withfreshman and sophomore
defensive tackles like Aaron Donald,
Tyrone Ezell and Khaynin Mosley-
Smith,‘ in addition to junior Justin
Hargrove and freshman T.J. Clem-
mings more depth at defensive end.

Randolph spoke highly of his un-
derclass defensive linemen, using en-
couraging football terms like “mean
and nasty” to describe Donald, “most
improvedplayerfrom the ﬁrst day” to
characterize Ezell and “giant among
men” to label Clemmings. .

The Panthers only have three
springpractices left, but Graham said
they have made large strides in learn-
ing the new systems for offense and
defenseastheteamsteadily increases
the pace of its practice regimen.

“We have a long way to go still,
and we’re two-thirds of the way done
with spring practice,” Graham said.
“There is a lot of work left to be ac-
complished.” I

Pitt to host first league
game in new stadium

Torie Wytiaz
A Staﬁ Writer

Pitt’s softball team can ﬁnally show off its
new Petersen Sports Complex to a Big,East
rival this weekend, just over two months
into the season.

After splitting a doubleheader at Ohio

‘State on Wednesday, the Panthers return

home to take on conference opponent
Louisville, at 27-10, in a three-game series
taking place on Saturday and Sunday to
round out the week. A
Playing ﬁve games in ﬁve days might

’ be tough for some teams, but the1Pan-

thers, now 24-8, have grown used to this
schedule after participating in a number
of tournaments where several games are
squeezed into a weekend.

“We just came off of a bye week, so the
midweek games against Ohio State and
the home series against Louisville come
at a good time,” Aprile said. “We were
able to balance our practice schedule ac-
cordingly so that we would be prepared
for the games.” = _

And though the Panthers have al-
ready played two games in the new Pe-
tersen Sports Complex -- splitting a series
against Penn State —"the Louisville series
will mark the Pitt women’s first conference
competition there, something that means
a lot to the team. » ' , -

Aprile noted that while all games are
signiﬁcant, the ones against Big East com-
petition seem a bit more exciting.

“Within the conference, there is a level

‘of familiarity among the teams, and when -

teams get on a roll, anybody can beat any-
body,” Aprile said. “Everyone is focused
on the Big East tournament, so the confer-
ence games tend to have a high degree of
competition.” , .
Both Louisville and Pitt enter the se-
ries touting plenty of offense, but despite
the importance of the series, Pitt senior
pitcher Cory Berliner knows that all Big

East teams present a challenge, no matter»

their record. .;
“Every year, the Big Eastis competitive

from top to bottom,” Berliner said. ‘‘Get-::
ting the conference victories is extremely

important to us.”

So far the Panthersxhave been success- 2
ful in that endeavor, currently 3-0 and tied ‘

with Notre Dame for second place in the
Big East after a three game series sweep
against Seton Hall earlier in'the season.

The Panthers will look to build on that
early season success against Louisville
with a formula of strong starting pitch-
ing and a solid offense, which has proved
beneﬁcial so far this season.

Joining Berliner in the starting rotation
are fellow senior Alyssa O’Connell and
freshman Karlynjones.

' With her 45th career victory against

Penn State on March 29, Berliner became

the all—time leader in wins in Pitt softball
history.

O’Connell has been similarly dominant,
leading the Big East in earned-run-average
and opponent-batting—average statistics.
Jones sports an 8-2 record, the best 10-
game start for a rookie in Pitt history.

P ; But the pitching staff will face a strong
challenge against Louisville, which boasts
a 5-1 conference recordand one of this
past,wee.k’s Big East Honor Roll selections
injfreshman Katie Keller. 1 1 P '

Keller, the Louisville second baseman,
has had seven hits in her last 14 at-bats,
including two homeruns and 10 RBIs. l

But the offensive support for the Pan-

ther pitchers has been strong recently,

‘as they scored 25 runs in their three wins

over Seton Hall and hitting is something
that Aprile has the team working on con-
stantly.

“We have been hitting well, and that is
something that we practice a lot during the

week,” Aprile said. “We want to stay sharp‘
r in that category and keep the "momentum

with us when we are at the plate.”

Carrying some of that momentum has
been junior Kelly Hmiel, currently the
Big East leader in slugging percentage at
.798 and the team leader in homeruns,
with nine. .

Also contributing to the Panthers line-
up this season are junior Yvette Bravo and
sophomore Holly Stevens, each with ﬁve

— homers.

While homeruns from sluggers like
Hmiel have helped the Panthers’ scoring
this season, Aprile is stressing the impor-
tance of other offensive components that
are often overlooked. ,

For example, senior Ashley Amistade
set another Pitt softball record when she
stole her-65th career base during the Penn
State series. Efforts like hers ﬁt in well
with Apri1e’s overall game plan.

“Our goal is to get runners» on base and
then move them into scoring position,”
Aprile said. “Ashley is always looking to
go.” -

With the pitching and hitting compo-
nents of their game in place, the Panthers
are ready for their next Big East contest
as they seek to build from their early suc-
cesses. ‘

“We played well against Seton Hall,”
Berliner said. “Continuing that level of
play throughout the Big East season will
be key in putting together a successful
year.”j
