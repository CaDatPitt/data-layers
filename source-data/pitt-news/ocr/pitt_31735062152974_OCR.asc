Mellon Gives
Med School  
$250,000 ‘ ,

The School of Medicine has
received " $250,000 from the
-Richard King Mellon Charit-
able Trusts, according to Dr.
" Francis S. Cheever, dean -of
the Medical School.

The grants, awarded to 23 of
the_ nation’s_ medical’ schools, are
to augment the salaries of fac-
ulty members engaged in medical
training._ I. ‘

The trust’s Board of Trustees, in

announcing its action, pointed out
that there are relatively more

funds available for medical re-
search and physical facilities-than
there are to-provide adequate sal-
aries for competent teachers.»The
Board feels that this is “the most
pressing need medical schools face
today.” 0

 

Critical Need
“There is an especially critical

younger teaching staffs so essential
for the continuing programs of
' 'medical- education,” the Board
stated: “More_ than. 800 unﬁlled
posts exist today in medical fac-'-
‘ulties in the country, especially in
' the younger ranks.”

The Board hopes that the
grants will make it possible to
attract and heip stabilize the
positions of the younger meme-

 

Accordingly, each of the- 23
schools will receive $50,000 per
year for the next ﬁve years.

According to ‘Dr. Cheever, the
gift is a great contribution to aca-
demic medicine because it will
- substantially strengthen .medica1
teaching programs throughout the
M country. '

“This gift,” he said, “will en-
able us to supplement our existing
funds to recruit and support addi-
tional faculty members.” '

Sidna Brower, former editor of
the University of Mississippi's
student newspaper, The Missis-
sippiau, stressed the obligation of
students to ﬁnd out and know the

Brower-shot to prominence last

her editorial, “Violence Will Not

She was on campus last’Mon-
day visiting the Nationality class-
rooms. _ .

Earlier, she had delivered a
lunch-time lecture at Point Park
Junior . College in downtown
Pittsburgh on “The Role of the
Student.” In her speech, she ad-

vocated that students should ex- _

amine traditional values in rela-
tion to the kind of world they
would like to see, rather than ac-
cepting or rejecting them blindly.

emerging nations who are looking
for leadership. They are not
strong enough to make more than
one mistake, he believes. “We

Dr. Carter Urey, Nobel prize
winning Professor of Chemistry
at the University of California
vigorously disagreed at the same
press conference, insisting that the

Must Keep Up

In reply, Webb acknowledged
Urey’s statement as a contribution
to thenational discussion of the
issue, but insistedlthe U.S. must
keep up with the Russians.

The President of Carnegie In-’
stitute of Technology, Dr. J. C.
Warner, had-scoffed at this no-
tion earlier. Speaking at the'Du-
quesne University’s Commence-
ment exercises Sunday, Warner
asserted that we are involved.
in the space venture not for the
scientiﬁc or military values but
for national prestige alone.

In addition, Dr. Warner stated,
"there is little evidence to support
the theory that our massive space
‘activity will result in future eco-
nomic advances.

Chicago Evidence

Webb held this to be false. As
‘proof, he, pointed to one project
in Chicago where steel mills were
using infra-red mechanisms de-
veloped during Project Mercury.
Webb said he had no other evi-
dence available at the time of the
press conference.

In his commencement address,
Webb quoted Edward Hale, an
1869 prophet, as correctly con-
tending, “It is only through in-
vestigation and research that in-
ventions come.”

In the same address Webb quo-
ted sections from the philosophy
of Henri Bergson. Asked about
Bergson’s philosophy, a university
philosophy ‘professor said that
Bergson was skeptical of the ef-
ﬁcacy of the scientiﬁc method and
deduction for’ attaining knowledge.

_ The main thesis of Webb’s ad-
dress was focused on the dynamic
changes occurring in this genera-
tion. He mentioned that a1l,socie-
ties must unleash_themselves from
reactionary bonds.

' He recalled that in Jefferson's
generation, farmers rejected the

would cause ‘weeds to grow. But

  Letters to the Editor

‘Student Cites
Bible Evidence

AA Editor, The Pitt News:
7 In reference to Stan Stein’s
“To Kill or Not to Kill,” I
would like to comment on a
‘ few aspects. This is not ‘meant
to be a homily.
»Mr.. Stein stated that the sup-
V porters of capital punishment
often give the Biblical phrase
“An eye for an eye, a tooth for
_ V ‘a “tooth” as a rationalization for
 . their «views. Being that America
V is, in general, a Christian na-
' tion, I would like to state its
ideological founder’s opinion:
-“You have heard it was said,
‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for
atooth.’ But I tell you that you
should not offer resistance to in-
jury . . . (Matthew, 5:20-24).
0 You have heard that it was said,
‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor
and hate thy enemy. . . but I
_.tell you, love your enemies; if
you love those who love you,
. what title have you to reward.”
And. yet Christ said justice must
prevail: “Thou shalt do not mur-
der; if a man commits murder,
he must answer for it before a
_ court of justice” (Matthew 5:21).
Mr. Stein stated he would
rather work with a healthy, ra-
tional criminal, i.e. one who
could be rehabilitated, than hope

  
    
  
   
  

evitable death as a result of
illness. I hope this does not
. mean one should still not hope.
A _ Miracles are not everyday oc-
currences as in the day of Christ
(if one accepts the scriptures),
but one cannot forget Christ’s'

_(Luke 7:21). Can one deny the

for miracles, i.e. in cases of in- ..

 

unforseen force, whether of cor-
poreal or spiritual nature. A

I wish to compliment Mr.
Stein’s belief that a healthy, ra-
tional criminal can be made into
a servant of humanity. The
scriptures show that a criminal
can ‘change: “Then he said to

Jesus, ‘Lord, remember me when i

Discriminatio_h_ Policy

Editor, The Pitt News:

Thank you for your answering
for my letter. I also wonder
whether there exists, any orga-

nized racial discrimination on '

this campus ‘like in the south.
But those small examples that
I cited, I mean not only about
that wife but also the articles,
have more importance, I -believe.
Racial discrimination is not
based on. .a group, but funda-
mentally on individuals. Unless
each ‘individual, therefore, real-
izes what he has been doing, it
cannot be solved.

The most important thing is
not to crush groups like 
but educate individuals. How-
ever, you are trying to ﬁnd
faults of’ the committee instead
of leading it. Please let me ask
you which you prefer to edu-
cate people by: a university or
by the armed forces.

The ‘Tip-Off . ::

 

Folow The Russians

After innumerable soul-searching days and
sleepless nights, someone ﬁnally tipped me off
as to: - ’

Why we are spending billions to reach the

-promised land — Ma waterless,

dusty unromantic imoon;

Why Congress quickly and
unhesitantly passes most any
space. billcthatwill get us to
the moon;

Why‘ Congress kills v_ most
bills designed to aid education-
on church—state s e p air a t i o n
grounds. _

The‘ logical, obvious answer?
Because the Russians are do- V.
‘ing it! '

Yes, my friends, let me tell you that for every
inane project conceived by‘ the U.S.S.R. govern-

 

ment, I promise at least one bigger and better

U.S. project.

Yes, let me‘ say that—I can predict the major
areas of the policy of the US. Government on the
basis of the Russian Five-Year Plans.

Goes One Further

George F. Kennan, author of Russia and the
West, said we are all prisoners of the past. ,1
will go one further and tell you that _we are all
prisoners of the future. Yes friends, I tell you we
are all predestined to fulﬁll the plan, and not the
American one.

A year or so ago the Saturday Evening Post
ran a series of articles concerned with our nation-
al purpose. These articles were written by fam-
ous Americans,,alleged.ly qualiﬁed to tell us why
in Zeus’ name this country is doing what it is.

But they missed the point. In fact‘, these arti-
cles should never have been written. Under the

‘_,title “Our National Purpose,” there should have
been in‘ truth a big, white, embarrassing blank.

For the truth is, this country has no national pur-
pose.

This wasn’t always. the case. A short time ago
we had a very venerable national purpose: to
pursue the “open-door” policy to‘ its most proﬁt-
able» advantages. _ r

. But now we have no national purpose because
the word purpose means something positive, and
something positive we don’t have. .What we as cit-

Finals. Furor . :;

By Thomas Plate

izens are stuck with is an “anti-Communist”
policy, as the honorable members of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee proudly tell us.

What does this anti-Communist policy smean?
Well, for example, it meant that we had better
support Trujillo in Cuba, because Radio Moscow
clamors for his violent demise. It means that if
the U.S.S.R. supports freedom in some Central

, American country, we support the military dic-

tatorship in power.

Of course, there are certain advantages in
having this grave anti-Communist policy. One is
that policy-makers don’t have to worry much
about originality. Let ‘-the Russians think _some-
thing "up, let them act on it, then just hold a Na-
tional Security Council meeting and react tough-
ly. There are other advantages to ‘this outlook,
like you-can always write a good speech about
how we will oppose the Russians on the beach,
in the streets, etc., etc. '

I guess it is impossible to ask our government
to stop for a second an.d think about what this
country is doing and where it is going. Such a
reﬂection would require a certain amount of ra-
tionality, and rationality is another thing this
Government has’ little of.

Of course, John Foster Dulles was rather posi-
tive in his blustering way. Yes, one of the most ,

arrogant Secretaries of_ State ever to tell a Presi-
dent what to do was, atﬂcimes, excruciatingly

'_ positive. For example, he judged all forms of

neutralism to be indecent and immoral.

Not Even Goldwater

This is not- the kind of positive‘ policy I -would ’

advocate. Because the world is very complex,
there are no simple solutions _ that will solve all
our problems, no “Peace, Bread and Land” slogan
with which to seize power. I havenone, and I am
sure not even Senator Barry Goldwater.has one.

But the anti-Communist policy, or more ac-_‘
curately the anti-U.S.S.R. policy that has maoti-'

vated even our, supposedly scientiﬁc space pro-
gram, is not barely adequate‘ to deal with changing
situations, realigning. nations, and A devastating

. weapons.’ It is high ‘time for a change, for. we can

no longer don, our white cowboy suits and ‘chase
after the bad guys ‘in the black outﬁts robbing

the noon stage. coach. We are in an age compli- H
ecated by_a full spectrum of factors. '

A

New System. - 

A recent survey of professors at the University"
shows that many are dissatisﬁed with the present
ﬁnals-system.) Some wouldlike to abolish ﬁnals
completely, while others prefer instituting a read-
ing’ period before ﬁnals,_ and I
extending thelength of exam-
inations .fromi two to three
hours; A third group is satisﬁed
with the present system.

The present ﬁnals system is
inadequate. It does not help the '_
student jell the facts that he 1
has accumulated through the ,
term. Most ﬁnals test nothing 
more than the‘ student’s ability 5
to recall specific facts. They do
not require him to show how _
the facts relate to the whole of the course.

The system, as it now stands, places a greater
emphasis on grades than it does on knowledge.
This encourages cheating, ~ and places extreme
pressure on even the best student. Many finals
count as much as 60 per cent of the entire grade.

Abolishing the ﬁnals system entirely,'however,
would do no more to help a student see the re-
lationship among the facts he studied, then break-
ing Maury Wills’ leg makes him a better runner.
Reading Period W_ouIdl-lelp ,

A reading period before ﬁnals would help the
student consolidate his knowledge, and see the
interrelationship ofthe facts he studied. It would
also give him time to think about what he has
studied, carefully evaluating the facts and theor-
ies that lay before him.

But the three hour ﬁnal would place more
emphasis on grades than the present two hour
system. Also, it would necessitate a lengthening
of the finals time from one to two weeks.

This, when coupled with a one week reading
period, represents 3 weeks out of 15 ~ for the en-
tire trimester. 20 percent of -the trimester would

- be devoted to ﬁnals. This would hardly give the,
students anything toistudy, and the courses would .

 

 

 

, ’ By Marvin Zelkowitz

be necessarily sketchy, i.e., less comprehensive.
Three hour ﬁnals would be worthless, ‘because the
student wouldn’t know enough abouthis subject
to write‘ for three hours. ‘
In light of the above problems,’ the solution is
obvious. First, the present system of testing should
be abolished, with the examinations being re-

placed by short term papers. Second, in place of

ﬁnals week, there should be discussion sessions led

. by 'instructors.’These sessions would enhance the

student’s comprehension of the course. r i
The present testing ‘system does " not help the

‘student understand what he is studying. There-
fore, it: should be abolished. ‘It places unreason- .
able, extremepressure on students. In most cases, A

ﬁnals do not raise or lower grades, in ‘spite of their

— theoretical. worth. Also,_most of them do"not test

comprehensive knowledge and understanding of

facts. They merely test memory andthe ability to

work under pressure.
The final examination should be replaced

» bya term paper of 1500-2000 words. In this paper,

the student would have the opportunity to show
his .understan_ding of the course. He would be
able to take the facts presented in the course
and relate them to the general concepts.
Experiment Instead of Paper‘

In the laboratory_ course, instead of a paper,
the student would perform an experiment which
necessitated an understanding of the theories
studied in the course. Then he would turn in his
experiment in .the form of a‘ paper, explaining
what he had done, and why. '

In addition to this, there should be a one week

‘reading period giving the student time to think

about what he had‘ studied . during -the term. It
would also give, him a chance to do further read-
ing, thereby increasing his knowledge of the
course. '

The above proposed system fulﬁlls the pur-

pose of ﬁnals. "\Ieek, and 1 "gives , the student the f «
opportunity to explore and ‘gain a true‘ ‘under-' -  A

‘Cox and Box’

By LARRY BERNEELD

The Pitt Players opened
their production of “Cox and
Box” on the Cathedral lawn
_ Wednesday, May 29, with
 sound effects provided by
$9;-.“«‘=;:_ Forbes ‘Ave. Streetcars Inc.
and The Fifth Ave. Drag ‘Racing
Association. These foreseen diﬁi-~
culties, however, were taken in
stride and did- not detract from
the overall success of the Uni-

versity Theatre’s first out-of-
doors performance.

A smallaudience of 90 to 100'
' came to see Sir Arthur Su1livan’s
comic operetta in the ﬁrst per-
/’.‘-formance .of the experimental
-Q-theatre-in-the-lawn. The, three-
man cast, Bob Sestili, Gil Lazier
and James Berry, provided an
entertaining combination of sing-
ing, dancing and acting.

By BARRY GROSS

Balzac, despite the popu-
larity of his novels, tottered
on the edge of bankruptcy
because he insisted upon
making last-minute changes
in his books after the type
for them had been cast.

Costly author's alterations sel-
dom keep great writers thin but
they are one of the little demons
discussed by Edmund C. Arnold
in Ink on Paper: A Handbook
of the Graphic Arts (Harper &
Row, 323 pages, $7.95).

Arnold begins his book with
ths statement: “The level and
life of civilizations depend on
,how easily and permanently they
can duplicate written messages.”

Fourth Floor Anguish

He describes how alphabets de-
veloped and how printing began,
but does not bore the reader

with a “One day, _Johann Guten- ,
berg wondered if manuscript‘

copying could be improved upon
. .’ ,"‘ approach.

Instead, Arnold delves into

themechanics of printing, sug-

» gests how anyone from Den

Mothers to corporation execu-

V tives can choose ﬁtting forms

for written communication, and

hints at what causes anguish

and late hours on the fourth

ﬂoor of Schenley Hall in stu-
dent publications.

The spectrum of Arnold’s at-
tention stretches from cave paint-
ings to newspapers, produced
withoutltype metal and includes
little’ pleasantries such. as his
unique example of offset print-
ihg. ‘ '

Madison Manipulation

It .seems that, until ballpoint
pen manufacturers changed their
inks, forgers could press their
thumbs on genuine signatures
and transfer the image onto con-
venient blank checks.

Anyone who has been tyran-' 3
nized by printers, who may be ;
working with pictures and the .

printedlword, or'who simply is
curious about
varied
country’s eighth largest business
in 1959 will ﬁnd Ink on Paper a
basic introduction to printing,
and a storehouse of anecdotes
about man’s genius in manipu-

lating symbols.
