Search continues for Pitt provost position

Byjack Finn

Asst News Editor .

Pitt is still actively looking for someone
to fill the vacant provost position left by
Donald Henderson’s leave this past
August.

The provost search committee held a
public forum on Friday to keep the uni-
versity community informed of its
progress. '

Committee Ch.air Mary Louise Soffa
told the small audience that applications
were being sought through a number of
sources. S

“We will be running an ad in the New
Your/e Times on Sunday, Oct. 17,” Soffa
said. 1

“We have also sent letters to
[Association of American_Universitiesl
presidents and provosts seeking qualified
candidates,” she said.

i Soffa said the committee hopes to gar-
ner candidates both from within and out-
side the university. ‘S

“We are looking to begin reviewing the
applications by the end of November.”
Soffa said. “We will then filter that list to
about 14 serious candidates.” ,

After informal interviews, the commit-

tee plans to trim the list of candidates to
five or six. In depth interviews and other
screening processes will provide a short
list that Soffa said she hopes to have to
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor by
April 1, 1994. .

‘ “The chancellor has said that he would
like the provost in place by September
1994,” Soffa said.

The search for a new provost was
made necessary by the announcement of
the retirement of former Pitt Provost
Donald Henderson this past April.
Henderson is taking leave until

Students
ask for
SGB to
support
coalition

By Matt Groff

_ Asst. News Editor

in the wake of rece.nt crime
around the Pitt campus, Kirsten
Bronkovic says she will do every-
thing she can as a Pitt student to
make Oakland safer.

“A friend of mine was almost
shot in front of the [William Pittl
Union last week,” Bronkovic
said. “l reali7.e'- this is a city
school, but there must be some-
thing we can do to feel safer at
Pitt.” '

Bronkovic spoke for more than
20 people who attended Friday’s
Student Government Board
Meeting in support of improved

W safetyat Pitt. She_ asked the SGB
to support a “pro-active” coali-
tion to effect public policy mak-
ing and heighten student aware-
ness. ,

“We’re willing to help,” board
member Ted Schroeder said.
“But it is discouraging for our
Safety Chair Derek Majikas to set
up a safety seminar and hardly
anyone shows, which just hap-
pened this week.”

Majikas said the seminar,
which featured safety experts,
was attended by only 10 people.
Majikas added that most of the
crime is concentrated on Forbes
Avenue, an area where Pitt has
no jurisdiction.

“Forbes is city property,”
Majikas said.

“Mayor Masloff shot down an
anti-loitering law that may have
helped problems on Forbes. The
best thing I can say is for stu-
dents to voice their wishes to city
officials.”

“We will be speaking with city
Councilmember Dan Cohen
when he comes to Pitt next
week,” Bronkovic said.

Hoping to change the stereotypical
image of Greeks as just being interested
in drinking and partying, several fraterni-
ties cleaned the hill that leads up to their
fraternity houses Friday afternoon.

“Greeks aren't all party, party, party,”
Publicity Chair of Phi Kappa Theta Nico
Fazzolari said. Phi Kappa Theta fraternity

said it organized this event with its
Greek colleagues, Sigma Chi and Delta
Tau Delta. t

' '“Over the years, the hill has been get-
ting really bad, so we thought it was our
duty to clean it up,” Sigma Chi member
Greg Simunick said.

The hill used to be overgrown with
vegetation that was interspersed with
debris, according to fraternity members.
Cleaning the hill is only one step in Phi

Kappa Theta’s plan to cultivate better
relations with the university and other
fraternities, Chuck Whisman, project
organizer and president_of the fraternity,
said.

The fraternities want to be able to
communicate with the university in a

_ mutually beneficial way, he said.

Over the last four years Whisman said
he has seen relations between the uni-
versity and Greeks improve, and that he

Fraternities unite to clean upeandfoster community spirit

is optimistic they will continue to grow.
As a civil and environmental engineer,
Whisman said the brothers want a_“bet—
ter living environment” and are doing
the work to enact this by re—landscaping

_the hillside.

“We know that we have to take care of
our own house, and we want to,” he
said.

The cleaning of the hill also represents

take heart. You’ll soon be able
to receive a discount just by
ﬂashing your Pitt ID.

Oasis and Sam Goody are
among the businesses and
restaurants in the Oakland area
which will be taking part in a
new. discount program for Pitt

_ students.

Student Government Board
member Joe Foner announced
at Friday’s meeting that he has
been working on implementing

the program, which is slated to '

begin at the end of October.
The program will be in effect

through June 30, 1994, and will I

begin again next July 1.
So far, Sbarro, Tela. Ropa, Air
Wait‘, Wendy’s, Miami Subs,
Jay’s Bookstall, Avalon, Subway
and Pizza Hut are among the
businesses Foner said he has
contacted about the program.
According to Foner, the dis-
count program was supposed to
start earlier this year, but prob-

usinesses to o

  

lems with designing contracts
with the businesses involved
led to the delay.

“SGB is liable if a business
gets screwed,f’ Foner said, “so
the contracts had to be dead on.
We didn’t get it done until
September.”

Foner said he is trying to‘

involve businesses which com-
pete with others in the area. “If
we can get TCBY, I think we’ll
definitely get Dave & Andy’s
and Baskin Robbins.”

In addition to involving sever-
al businesses in OakCland’s
main business district, Foner

said he -is contacting some

North Oakland businesses such
as Pizza Outlet and Baskin
Robbins on North Craig Street
for inclusion in the program.

Foneralso said he is not con-
centrating on Oakland’s most
frequently visited restaurants.
such as McDonald’s and The
Original Hot Dog Shop.

“T hey’re not going to benefit
from this,” Foner said. “You
can’t tell me people are going to
be encouraged to go to those
places because of a discount

to New World

 

when they go there in droves
already.” _

In other SGB business, SGB
President . Jacob Brody
announced the clock, which
will be installed on the William
Pitt Union lawn, will be arriving
this Wednesday. Brody said the

~four-sided clock, which mea-

sures fifteen-feet, six-inches,
will be dedicated to retired Pitt
Provost Donald Henderson.
“The Student Government
Board would like to extend
appreciation for ' what
[Henderson] has done for the
student body,” Brody said.
According to Brody, a time
capsule will be buried at the
base of the clock after it is
installed. He said anyone with
ideas of what to put inside the
capsule should contact him or
board member Ted Schroeder.
The capsule will be opened in
2093. Brody said a “What Will
Pitt Be Like in 100 Years” essay
contest will be held with the
best essays being buried inside
the capsule. ‘
Brody said he has also been

discussing plans for opening the I

I CORRECTION

In the Wednesday, October
6, issue of The Pitt News,
senior vice-chancellor of
Business and Finance Ben
Tuchi was inaccurately
reported as saying he want-
ed to make Pitt's financial
status and organization the
most important aspect of the
university. Rat-her, Tuchi's
goal is to make Business and
Finance one of the most effi-
cient -and respected offices
on campus. In the same arti-
cle,’ it was said Penn State
had a $700 million debt,
which is also inaccurate.
Penn State's debt is, in fact,
much lower.

PPCgem¢s  Homecoming

By Wendy Parkhouse
For The Pitt News

Free entertainment, a chance
to win a new Jeep Eagle and a
ﬁreworks and laser show. These
are just some of the activities
that Pittrstudents can enjoy dur-
ing Homecoming Week.

“We are hoping for real good
weather, and we’re hoping for a
big turnout. There will be all
kinds ofthings for students to
do this Homecoming Week,”
Assistant Director of Student
Activities Tom Misuraca said.

Today, any student with a val-
idation sticker on their student
I.D. can cast their vote for both
Homecoming king and queen
and the court from 10 am to 4
p.m. in the Towers Lobby, the
Cathedral of Learning or the
William Pitt Union. ’ '

Also, students can participate
in various activities sponsored
by Jeep Eagle on the union’s,

Bigelow Lawn.

“They will be giving out sam-
ples, as well as a number of
activities for the students,
including a rock climbing wall
and an alcohol IQ test. All kinds
of activities. You will see a
whole bunch of tents and activi-
ties set up on Bigelow Lawn,”
Misuraca said.

The one activity students will
have to pay for is a comedy
concert on Wednesday night in
the WPU Assembly Room.
Tickets are $5 for students and
$10 for non-students. The com-
edy concert features Reverend
Billy C, Wirtz and Frank
Nicotero.

Thursday, students can
receive some discounts at Uncle
Sam’s, Bruegger’s Bagels Bakery
and Pizza Hut, while showing a
little school spirit for Pitt Nite
Out.

“Pitt Nite Out basically is, if
you walk into any participating

merchants wearing something

. that says Pitt on it, they will give

the appropriate discount,”
Misuraca said.

There will be a touch of .

Hollywood on campus on
Thursday.
The Pitt Program Council has

organized Pitt—Tac-Toe, a game,

show similar to “Hollywood
Squares,” about Pitt, featuring
Pitt celebrities like Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon, Student
Government Board President
Jacob Brody and the Pitt
Panther. '

“The overall winner gets tick-
ets for two wherever USAir ﬂies
in the United States, compli-
ments of USAir,” said Misuraca.
Second—p1ace winners will
receive a dinner for two at
Hemingway’s and free movie
passes.

Thursday there is a pep rally

With Homecoming fast approaching, the ques-

tion of who will be crowned king and queen for
1993 has taken on a new meaning. A

It still matters to some people, but for others,
they really don’t care who wins or if there is even
a competition. ' I

Pitt has returned to the old style of

iHomecorning procedures. This year anyone who

wishes can run for the age-old title of
Homecoming king or queen. “Any student can
run if they have at least a 2.0,” Assistant Director
of Student Activities Tom Misuraca said.
Candidates just have to fill out an application and
pay a $10 fee. .

For the past three years, becoming a member of
the Homecoming court was not that easy. Court
selection was based on an “independent panel of

interviewers who would interview each candidate
and look for speciﬁc things: service to the univer-
sity, grades and how they handle themselves in
stressful situations,” Misuraca said. A

“Previous to that it was just a popular election,”
he said. V

Pitt Program Council Special Events Committee
Head Christine Bell said, “This year, we have
whoever wants to run in the general election. The
court is determined from the voting and so are
the king and queen.”

The PPC switching back to the general election
voting procedures because of the results of a tele-
phone suryey conducted last year.

PPC found “overwhelming results that the stu-
dent population said that, while Homecoming
didn’t mean anything to them, and they felt that
their Homecoming king and queen didn’t have
any meaning to them personally or in terms of
what they thought of the university, they still felt

BiGALA prepares
for National Coming
Out Day celebration

By Robin Senor
Staﬂ Writer

Blue and gold will not be the only colors seen this week in
the ‘William Pitt Union, students will also be seeing a little
more pink. V

Pink triangles to be exact.

Today is National Coming Out Day for bisexuals, gays and
lesbians, and pink triangles are the universal symbol for
homosexuality. According to Sacha Layos, Bisexual, Gay and

V Lesbian Alliance co—president, BiGALA will begin celebrating
the event today but will have events all week.

Oct. 11 was chosen to commemorate the 1987 March on
Washington For Lesbian and Gay rights. One year later, a
group of lesbian and gay community leaders gathered in
Virginia and designated it the first Coming Out Day.

“Monday and Tuesday we will have information booths in
the student union. Hopefully, they will be very visible just to
underscore the fact that it is Coming Out Day,” said Layos.

The booth will serve more than one purpose, according to
members. ’

“The impact is that information booths serve a purpose by
their existence. When I was in the closet, I didn't come up to
the booths, but I saw them, and it made me feel comfortable
that there were people to talk to when I wanted to,” Layos
said.

Business Manager Todd Kinavey pointed out another
impact the booths could have.“Being out in itself is the
strongest political statement you can make,” he said.

Being out and being visible is what BiGALA members are
striving for during Coming Out Week. Members said that
their goal is to become more -visible in the Pittsburgh com- '
lmunity, which they say has a reputation of being conserva-
tive.“It’s easy to ignore something if you can’t\see it. When
it’s right in front of you, you can’t ignore it,” said member
Moira Meadows.

On Monday there will be a panel discussion in the William

*‘ Pitt Union» about what it is like to be out and on the job. On
Wednesday there will be a coming out discussion group.

A table will be set up in the union on Monday and

Tuesday, complete with pink triangle cookies.

Socialist Club a

By Jenifer Braunstein
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Socialist Club isan educational discussion
group, but the group does not stop just at discus- _
I sion. V

“The group is pretty loose. We provide a way to
facilitate students’ ideas about socialism,”

President Lorraine Starsky said. I

Although educating people about socialism and
having debates is the main emphasis of the
I group, it also provides a means to fight injustice.

“We try to be a network and let people know
what is going on so they can participate and take

a stand,” Starsky said.

The Socialist Club’s members try to work with
other groups on issues of pro—choice, racism,

ims to fight injustice

stopping police brutality and helping striking coal
miners and other unions. The group tries to get
people politically involved.“We try to defend

human rights, such as the right to an abortion,”
member Matilda Zimmerman said. ‘
Meetings are held every Sunday from 4 p.m. to
5:45 pm. in room 525 of the William Pitt Union.
Topics of discussion in the future range from

the origins of women’s oppression, what went

wrong in the Russian Revolution of 1917, how
Stalin came to power and Cuban ideas about
Socialism and Che’ Guevara. "

~Although. being politically active is not the
major goal for the group, several of the members

went to Washington, D.C., last April for the march

for gay rights. Some members went to Cleveland
to represent the pro—choice movement at a clinic.

Pitt School of Engineering ranks
big/9 among Corporate recruiters

By Kelly A. Hanna
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s
School of Engineering has
proven to be an extremely afﬂu-
ent institution because of the
dedicated and determined grad-
uates, according to the numer-
ous‘ companies that attended
this year’s corporate exposition.

The seventhannual fair, held
Thursday in the William‘Pitt
Union, sponsored such compa-
nies as Honda of America, The
International Paper Company,

General Motors and IBM
Corporation.

By noon, 200 students had
already attended, and

Engineering Student Council
President Jeanette Jolmson said
she expected at least 300 more.

Phil Simon, a recruiter from
the International Paper
Company, said that he is consis-
tently impressed by the poise
and intelligence of University of
Pittburgh engineering gradu-
ates.

“I consider Pitt to be one of

the most highly ranked places.

that we want to recruit from.
They are hard workers and
practical people. We’ve had
great experience with Pitt engi-
neering grads,” Simon said.

The point of the fair is to give
students an opportunity to meet
with the people behind the cor-
poration. Junior Jennifer Kern
has already applied for a ’co—op
position with the Miles
Corporation, but she came to
the fair to meet with the people
who review the applications,

Kern added that being a
woman in the field of engineer-
ing is often difficult. She said
that often times she does feel
“uncomfortable.”

This experience gave her the
chance to talk one on one with
women already in the field and
gave her more of a perspective.

Leona Mitchell, an employee
of IBM- and a Pitt grad, insisted
that doing this type of recruiting
does have enormous benefits.

She said the job market right
now is very good, and that IBM
is looking for students in chemi-
cal, industrial, electrical and
mechanical engineering, as well
as technical writers and market-
ing and sales representatives.
She also said IBM accepts a lot
of resumes and takes each one
very seriously.

Jim Peternel, a second-year

, graduate student studying man-

ufacturing, also attended the
exposition to get a feel for the
companies to "which he would
like to apply.

“It warms you up for the real

_ thing,” he said.

Kirsten Bronkovic, who represented a group of Pitt students
at the meeting, said, “We wanted to express our concern
about public safety and see how we could work with SGB or
any other student groups that would like to work with us.”

Brody also said he was_pleased with the number of stu-
dents taking part in the upcoming SGB elections. According
to Brody, approximately 10 people have returned petition
packets for president, and 21 students returned petitions for
board positions. Last year two students ran for SGB presi-
dent, and 10 ran forthe board.Elections Committee Chair
Deborah Ryan said petitions are due in the SGB office
Thursday Oct. 14.

In old business, the board approved a request from the
Nursing Student Association to install a voting area in the

Victoria Building.

Festival

Culture came out through
the many craft and ceramic
stands, which contained lavishly
decorated ceramic
plates, mugs, salt and pepper
shakers, water pitchers and can-
dles. _

‘Some woodwork stands con-
tained small, precisely detailed
beads, earrings, candleholders,
wooden dishes and eggs.

A fashion show, displaying
Ukrainian handmade fashions,

‘ was put on by some teenage

girls. The clothing was dis-
played as Ukrainian art because
it contained embroidered
Ukrainian folk art on handmade‘
linen, which is over 200 years
old. The clothes were not
labeled with a price tag since
they were so old.

Ukrainian music played in the
background of the festival,
which made it a more friendly
and festive atmosphere. If the
people liked what they heard,
they could buy Ukrainian cas-
settes and compact discs.
Children also played a

eggs’,

Ukrainian instrument called a
bandora, which added to the
atmosphere.

As the music played and peo-
ple shopped and purchased
their favorite decorated ceram-
ics, crafts, T—shi1“ts and jewelry,
others congregated over the
food and pastry concession
stands.

The food favorites were pero-
gies, hollupkie, haluskie, bor-
shch and Ukrainian bread.

Favorite homemade pastries
were also for sale, such
as: pizzels, which look like a

gwaffle and taste like a cookie;

lekuar which are baked prune

and nut squares and baked »

pyrohy, which are mashed
potatoes in pockets of baked
dough.

The food was made and
donated by several churches
around the Pittsburgh area.

This festival drew quite a
large crowd because there are
many Ukiainizln families in the
area. The Ukrainian community
of Pittsburgh, according to Jula,
is over 100 years old.

Senior Jenifer Whitaker said
she .‘‘simply wants to do away

we did.”

~ December when his retirement

will be finalized. Mark
Nordenberg, fomier dean of the
law school, is interim provost
until a permanent selection is
made by O’Connor. _
Pitt philosophy professor
Wesley Salmon, who was on
the last search committee for a
provost seven years ago, told
those attending the forum that,
“the hardest part of the search is
getting a line on candidates
from very divergent views.”
Salmon also stressed that “a
head hunter shouldn’t be used.
It’s expensive and useless.”
Salmon said their committee
spent about $50,000 to get 20
profiles on candidates from a

’ professional search firm.

“And make sure your candi-
dates have high academic
standing at their institutions,”
Salmon said.

To do that, Salmon suggested
that the search committee seek
several independent views of
the candidates.

the reaching out of the university to the
Greek community, Whisman said.

Pitt Housing provided the weedwhack-
ers to clean the hillside and also laid
down mulch on the hillside this past sum-
mer. A representative from Support
Services attended the cleaning day.

Wendall Jones from Pitt Housing
Services said that he thinks it looks good.
“I think it’s fantastic. T hey’re not getting
anything for this,” Jones said.

The fraternities also said they were will-
ing to do their share as well in reaching
out to the administration. .

“I want to show them that we’re willing
to meet them halfway and help as much
as we can in return for them to help us
with things for our house,” Joe Butters,
Phi Kappa Theta director of university
outreach programs said.

Along with cleaning up the hill, the

project helped fraternities gain a sense of P’

community as well-
“One thing we’re trying to do, that’s

is communicate better with all the frater-
nities. There’s been some animosity, but
we’re trying to get along better, and this
project is a good example of the direction

. we’re heading in in terms of relationships

among all the fraternities,” Delta Tau
Delta President Brian Riﬂdn said.

Phi Kappa Theta deserves all the credit
for the project, Rifkin said, adding that
Delta Tau Delta will continue to par-
ticipate in future efforts to clean up the
hill. - .
Simunick said he agreed the project
was a success in ways other than clean-
ing. “You go out, and it’s a joint effort  it
really builds relationships between the
fraternities,” he said. ~

Phi Kappa Theta member J.J. Seiler said
that this example to the new pledges
facilitates continuity in the attitude for
reaching out. '

‘‘They’ll see how important it is to work
with the university, and they will contin-
ue that feeling for the next four years,” he

The Mid-Eastern Province president of
the 10 chapters of Phi Kappa Theta, Gene
Ney, was also there to watch-the hill
transform.

“It’s an opportunity, not only to exhibit
school spirit, but also contribute back to
the school from which it comes,” Ney
said. ‘ ‘

The cleaning of the hill will help all
Greek organizations to “reaffirm a com-
mitment to the ideals from which all orga-
nizations initially begin,” according to
Ney. -

Within‘ two hours, the trash was
cleaned up and extraneous foliage was

cleared. The ground is being prepared for

upcoming planting.

The cleaning of the hill has happened
once before and will be an ongoing
process.

“I did it last year. We just cleaned up
the trash though,” Phi Kappa Theta Jason
Markle said. He said he thought that it
looks much better this time.

(1.5. cant afford to overloolepovertgt

American society has come a long way in the past 50

~ years. The standard of living for many has improved,

the technology at our fingertips is at times magical,
many diseases have been defeated and people around
the world depend on our many charitable citizens.

. But inother ways the United States is very backward.
It is as if our nation _is a contradiction -in terms.

On the one hand, many of ‘us are living in the modern
world thinking modern ideas. But on the other, millions
of Americans, many of "whom are children, go to sleep.
hungry. Poverty in America is a problem which will

haunt us for many generations unless tough action is

taken to curb it.

Robert J. Lampman, -one of the architects of’LBJ’s War
on Poverty, 'wrote’in 1971 that poverty could be elimi-
nated in this country by 1980. Encouraging at that time
was the fact that between 1961 and 1971»the number of

poor people in America had. fallen by more than one— -

third. In 1961 therewere 59.6 million poor Americans,
and in 1971 that number decreased to 25.6 million.

The numbers are in for 1993, and this time 'they’re not
very encouraging at all. The Census Bureau reports. that
the number of poor Americans rose for the third con-
secutive year in 1992 to a total of 36.9 million. That’s
14.5 percent of the population.

The number of those Americans below the poverty
line is not only large in number and increasing, but the
face of poverty in general has changed over the past 50

A years. Although poverty among the elderly has sharply

decreased, due in part to the fact that Social Security
increases every year with inﬂation, poverty among chil-
dren has’ increased. In 1969, 14 percent of children in
America suffered from poverty. In 1993, the staggering

figure is 21.9 percent. And this po,or_..s.e_ctor is commonly!

found in places many would classify as ghettos.

There are also new elements which lead to the com-
plication of the poverty problem. According to The New
Yorle Times, there are more government benefits for the
poor now than in the past. However, there is a lack of
physical security in the poverty-stricken areas of the

' country. The rise of violent crime, especially intermit-

tent shootings, has made life even more difficult for
America’s poor. L _
There are many facets of society which are to blame

‘for the enormous poverty problem. There are dimmer

employment prospects now than there were 30‘years
ago, due to the changes in labor markets that work to
the disadvantage of less—skilled workers, according to
Frank Levy, an urban ‘economics professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Additionally,
real wages were growing in the 19605, whereas in
today’s economy those wages are very ﬂat.

Regardless of lwho’s to blame for ignoring the prob-
lem in the past, there seems to be a lack of national will
to solve the problem of poverty. America and its poor
cannot afford to overlook it any longer.

Don't believe everything you read

The perspective page is
where students can express
their views and find food for
thought.

However, there is a certain
risk that comes with reading the
letters and columns. The risk is

losing sight of the real issues in .

all of the rhetoric.

It’s good that you, the reader,
care enough to bother looking
at something other than the
front page and the box scores.

‘ But beware of the glittering
generalities used on this page
and by any would-be leader or
liberator at this university.
“Glittering generalities” are any
statements designed to inflame
emotion and by-pass intelli-
gence.

A few examples from your
own Pitt News would best illus-
trate the point. One of the best
is “[thel union between Arafat,
Israel, Clinton, Bush, Carter and
Chancellor O’Connor.”

Did anyone take this at face

value, and can you imagine a
collusion between these men? If
you Can, then it must be nice to
know the chancellor has such
influence in international
events.
‘ “Jew—hating dog” is another
example. This must be a goose-
stepping German shepherd with
a swastika armband.

My final two examples are
“ANYONE living in America ..;
who says they aren’t racist is just
plain lying,” and “PITT ITSELF
IS ALREADY A WHITE CUL-
TURAL CENTER.” ‘

These are particularly interest-

. ing because of the words and

phrases. in capital letters.

Apparently the author didn’t_.

thinkyou could pick out the
important points for yourselves,
so he conveniently capitalized

them.

Inaddition to knowing how
weak your minds are, he also
knows how you feel in your
heart of hearts, as the saying
goes. ‘

He knows that you and every-
one else, including the person
who has been blind from birth
and cannot distinguish between
the races, are racists. .

The best way to deal with

 these glittering generalities». is to

Use YOUI‘ COIDIHOD SCHSC and

Benjamin
Jackson

ask whoever uses them to
define their terms.

I tried “Jew-hating dog,” but I
bet my definition is not what
the authors of that particular
piece had in mind.

My image is rather comical,
but it doesn’t inﬂame any erno—
tions. That is the point of these
phrases. They want to deprive
you of your common sense and
direct your thinking.

Let’s try another definition:
“white cultural center.” I’ll be
serious with this one. A '

.To have a “white cultural cen-
ter” you have to have a “white
culture.” What is “white cul-
ture?” _ ’ -

Why don’t we ask the English
and the Irish in North Ireland or

.maybe the Bosnians and the

Serbs? Better still‘, -walk through
the ethnic neighborhoods of
any big city then give me one
definitive description of “white

. culture.” _

The university is here to edu-

-cate people.

Education opens. minds and
teaches critical thinking. If the
university is a cultural center,
then it is a center of American
culture. A

American culture is made up
of the cultures of every group
that has lived on this continent.
We are all Americans first
(excluding international stri-
dents). -

lAs I once heard an anony-‘R

rnous combat veteran put it,
”When you’re in the combat
zone and you need help, you
don’t care if the man coming to
help you is black or white, just
that he’s on your side.”

‘The examples above weren’t
chosen to attack any specific
author. They were chosen
because they emphasize the
divisiveness of the language.

If anyone was truly con-
cerned with multiculturalism,
they would be clamoring for
people to comprehensively
study the history of the United
States. . _

The history of this nation as a
whole is a multiculturalist’s
dream. I

After the recent battle in _

Moscow, National Public Radio

reported that Boris Yeltsin
addressed the people saying, '

"Whatever their convictions,
they were all children of Russia,
and that is the real tragedy”, He
was talking about all of the peo-
ple killed. ‘

He directed this towards his
opponents as well as his sup-_
porters. ‘ .

- Letus learn from one of the
many “old countries” that has
contributed to our rich tradition
and come together as
Americans.

The advice to think before
you speak and to not make
comments about things that you
don’t know everything about is
not to be taken lightly.

It is also not a good idea to
belittle someone for a lack "of
knowledge that is circumstantial
of their environment. Especially

when your experiences are not‘

much further from their’s.

As a matter of fact, you
shouldn’t pass judgment on an
organization when you don’t
know its purposes or its reasons
for establishment. My example
of this is the many comments
made about the Black Action

Society, when people haven’t
been to room 627 of the William
Pitt Union one day in their life.

Imay only be a frrst—year stu-
dent here at Pitt, but I’ve been
an African American all of my
life! I am not blind to blunt
racial discrimination, and I am
certainly not a victim of para-
noia. I am, however, a victim to
people of ignorance, who do
not understand what it’s like to
be discriminated against, and
then attacked for telling the
truth.

For all" the poor souls who
were blessed with ignorance,
please allow me to help you

In Molefi Kete Asante’s The

The seat of the oldest organized
civilizations as well as the
birthplace of humanity.”
Webster Dictionary may be a
great resource for finding deﬁn-
itions, but true meanings come
from greater resources like
ancestors. ,

So please be careful of who
you call paranoid. Because, as I
see it, any group of people,
who would enslave an innocent
group of people and take them
to a strange land, so that they

were not only divided but lost
as well, to do the work that
those “humanitarian” Europeans
of long ago were too good to
do for themselves, sounds like
prime candidates for not only
paranoia, but more like an
insane asylum!

“The neglect of African ori-
gins and contributions to the
world’s intellectual history in
effect misrepresents much
knowledge and perpetuates a
narrow scholarship,” wrote
Asante. That’s all that needs to
be said!

CWO president wrong about abortion

I am writing to correct a blatant lie put

forth by Campus _Women’s Organization

co-President Bianca Stoner in the Oct. 14
issue of The Pitt News. When confronted
with the story of 16-year-old abortion sur-
vivor Gianna Jessen, Ms; Stoner remarked,
"Hers was an illegal abortion or is an ille-
gal abortion technique now. She is not an
accurate representation of abortion- It "has
nothing to do with what we are dealing
with.” 1

Perhaps Ms. Stoner should inform her-
self on the issue of abortion before she
takes to the streets in the name of child-
killing disguised as “choice.”

To set the record straight once and for
all, when Gianna Jessen’s mother was 24
weeks pregnant, she had a saline abortion.
Abortions at 24 weeks are common and
legal in all 50 states. During a saline abor-
tion, a salt solution is injected into the
mother's womb. The solution burns the
baby’s skin. The baby swallows the solu-
tion, and it burns the baby’s insides out._

_, The baby isgborn dead 24 hours later.

Saline abortions are common and legal in
all 50 states. The abortion that Gianna’s
mother had was, and still is, legal any-
where in the United States. '

After the saline abortion, Gianna

Jessen’s mother expected to deliver a dead

“fetus“ the next day. Instead, Gianna was
born alive, weighing a mere two pounds.
Her brain starved for oxygen during the

‘hours that she spent gulping the saline

solution. A nurse on the abortion clinic’s
staff rescued Gianna and kept her alive in
an incubator until she was stable enouglp
to be released. By then, she was diag-
nosed with cerebral palsy, which has
resulted in four major operations. She still
walks with-a slight limp‘ and sometimes
stumbles and falls, but she is otherwise an
energetic teenager. Pitt Students for Life is
pleased to announce that the entire uni-
versity can come and hear Gianna’s story
on Oct. 18 at’ 8:30 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

As for the misinformation put forth by
Bianca Stoner, I can only assume one of
two things. Either she purposely lied to
further her position, or she was misin-
formed. Giving her the benefit of doubt
(that she was misinformed), I think that
her remarks are telling. Perhaps Ms. Stoner
just assumed that.a procedure so brutal
must be illegal. In this case, I agree whole-
heartedly.

There is one thing that Bianca Stoner
was right about, however. That is when
she said, “She [Gianna Jessen] is not an
accurate representation of abortion.” For
Gianna’s sake, thank God.she’s not. If she
were an accurate representation of abor-
tion, she’d be dead like the 1.6 million

others who are killed every year by abor-

Black woman refutes racist statements

Student-'s for life leader deletes facts

I was terribly impressed with Jeff .

Paladina’s vivid use of propaganda

, in his recent abortion epistle. Like

the yellow journalists of days past,
Paladina realizes that the most effec-
tive way to blind the reader with
emotion is to delete facts from his
article. One such fact that Paladina
somehow overlooked was that the
abortion that he describes in vivid
detail, the “D and X” method, is an
illegal method and is therefore only
used in illegal abortions. Making
abortion illegal for all women,
which is the goal of Mr. Paladina
and Students for Life, will lead to
more of this “D and X” method of
illegal abortions.

Another fact that Paladina dismiss-
es with ease is the fact that Ana Rosa
Rodriguez’s mother was having an
illegal abortion. This circumstance
was in New York State, whereas in
most other states, abortions are ille-
gal after the 24th week of pregnan-
cy. _

Later in his article, Paladina refers
to the Freedom of Choice Act, which
is pending hearing in the House of
Representatives. Mr. Paladina says
that this act “would force all 50
states to allow abortions on demand,
even for sex selection, even in the
final months of pregnancy.” Once

again, his scare tactics are impres-
sive but lack validity. The Freedom
of Choice Act will not allow abor-
tions for sex selection and will not
be a blanket guarantee for_abortions
past the second trimester. If passed,
this act will only mean that a state
cannot prohibit a woman from hav-
ing an abortion. The states will
retain the right that they have now,
as a result of Roe Us-Wade, to set the
time limitation for how late in her
pregnancy a woman can have an
abortion. In most of the states,
including Pennsylvania, this is 24
weeks unless the mother’s life is in
danger for health reasons. ,
Mr. P-aladina also incorrectly
named the traditional method of
abortion, which he called the “D and

, E” method. There is_ no such
method, because the traditional suc- '

tion method of abortion is referred
to the “D and C” method. A mis-
placed letter here, some facts omit-
ted there, some fabricated ideas
tossed in for good measure and sev-
eral paragraphs of blatant sensation-
alism thrown in between made Mr.
Paladina’s article a shoddy work of

journalism.

African history is everyone's history

I have no intention of taking up the obvi-

ous petty hang-ups of Sarah and Max

Kaden, regarding what they perceive as
anti-Jewish remarks on the part of the Black
Action Society. But I most definitely want to
comment on the. phrase “chronically and
terminally afflicted with entitlement syn-

' drome, survive on handouts from others

and are unable to make it on their own.”
You, and many, many others of you who
think along these lines, are way off base. As
a proud black woman who comes from a
long ‘line of hardworking, struggling, no-
nonsense, black—oriente'd families, I resent
and take bitter exception to- your racist
remarks. My granddad worked in the coal
mines and bought and paid for with hard-
earned money, a beautiful farm and a home
in the city. My dad, a man among men of
any color, worked for Conrail, bought a
home and gave myself, my sister and broth-
er a wholesome life without my mother

having to work to help him. And I saw the

same hard work from my brother, uncle -

and cousins. They have never received,
expected, wanted or got any handouts from
anybody. They stood on their own two feet
and held their own like countless other

V black families.

So before your anger clouds your percep-

tion, you better re—evaluate what you are ‘

thinking, and what you are letting come out
of your mouth.
And as for your “solidarity with Arabs but

SOUTH BEND, IND. — For
one minute —' one lone
moment in an ugly, overcast
day — the mid—October sun
shined on Notre Dame
Stadium.

Somewhat symbolically and
completely fitting, it seemed
to shine totally on the Irish.

In the cold and dreary
South Bend afternoon, the Pitt
Panthers watched Irish run-
ning back Ray Zellars score
two touchdowns, and Lee
Becton rush for 142 yards, as
a respectable 13-point, half-
time deficit festered into a 44-
0 loss with a mistake—filled,
and sometimes comical, sec-
ond half of play.

“We can’t match up against
anyone,” Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors said. “I know
what were faced with, and
I’m a realist.”

“We wanted to show our-

capabilities,” Notre Dame
quarterback Kevin McDougal
said.

“We wanted to show [head
coach Lou] Holtz that we
could come back as a com-
pletely different team in the
second half.” I l

The Fighting Irish were

. in the second frame, as they

turned the ball over not a
once and ground out 262
rushing yards, evidence of. not
only an improving offense,
but a withered, tired Pitt
defense.

“We really played sharp [in
the second halfl,” Holtz said.
“There weren’t a lot of adjust-
ments to make, we just domi-
nated the game.”

“The second half we got
worn down like -we ‘did last
week [in a 29-7 loss to
Louisvillel,” Majors said.

The Panthers, aided by sev-
eral Irish mistakes, held
steady defensively in the first
half. But despite forcing three
turnovers, Pitt cold do noth-
ing to put points on the
board, as its offense wilted
under the intense Irish‘ heat.

defenses this year, and I’d

While the days of the 63-

Driscoll andMikla shine as women's volleyball sweeps Villanova

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer ~

A combination of Villanova’s
volleyball ineptitude and Pitt’s
strong attacking gave the
Panthers a commanding 13-4
stranglehold on game one of
the Friday night’s match at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The surprise was that the
team did it without a single kill
from the Big East’s best player,
outside hitter Ann Marie

_ Lucanie.

“The goal of the offense we

are running this year is to do ,

exactly that  to spread the
wealth and take the pressure

off of lLucanie],” Pitt head.

coach Cindy Braziel said.
“That’s just an example of
[what happens] when it works.”

Pitt (13—4, 5-0 in the Big East)
pounded its way to 15-8 and

15-9 wins in the first two
games of a three-game sweep
of the Wildcats (10—5, 0-2),
attacking mostly from the mid—
dle.

“‘Our other goal is to run a
middle-oriented offense in tran-
sition,” Braziel said. I

“We did that well. When we
pass [well] and when we are in
[our] system like that, no one
can touch us.” , ,

Middle hitters Jennie Driscoll
(13 kills in the match) and
Sarah Mikla (six kills) coin-
bined for seven kills and two
blocks in the opening game
(the rest, of the Panthers
totalled two). In the second
game, Pitt got another boost for
its improving middle attack.

Sophomore Alyssia Yanik, a
starter much of last season,
returned to the court for the
first time this season. She had

been recovering from off—sea-
son knee surgery.

“I was more excited than ner-
vous,” Yanik said. “I had a lot
of energy.” ‘E

Yanik displayed that energy
with four kills in that second
game, bringing a round of “I’m-
not-worthy” bows from assis-'
tant coach Brian Begor with the
first one.

“She really crushed some
balls tonight,” Begor said. “I
was as happy for her, as I was
selfishly [pleased] that we are
going to be a better team,
because it has been a hard
road for her. Never in the two
months [I have been here] have
I seen her  feel sorry for her-
self.'I have a lot of respect for
her because of that.”

Braziel pointed to two other
factors behind a Pitt middle ,
attack that combined for 25 of

Pitt’s 52 kills in the match.

“lSetter Annie Mernagh] is
getting healthy. [She has been
slowed by shin splintsl,” Braziel
said.

“That means she can work
more with the middles. The
middles are getting stronger. I

attribute that to [Begor]. He’s'

done a great job with the mid—
dles.”
Begor said the middle attack

_ is important because it disrupts

the opponents defense.

“It’s really hard to get in a
rhythm when the other team is
attacking the middle,” Begor
said.

“On the higher set [to the
outside] you have a little more
time to get set, but on the
quick attacks [in the middle]
you are in a funk.”

Villanova was that, killing
themselves with errors through-
out the match. The team had
seven hitting errors, five service
errors and a ball—handling error
in the first game alone.

“Pittsburgh does. so many
things well that they cause you
to not do what you are capable
of doing,” Villanova head
coach Ron Twomey said.

“It was one of our worst
matches. That’s __not just
because ' we stunk. [The
Panthers] did it to us.”

By the third game, play
became sloppy on both sides
of the net. ]

“It was our ugliest match of
the season,” Twomey said.

“I think Pittsburgh played
down to our level after_ a little
while.”

Lucanie asserted herself as
the Panthers pulled out a 15-12
win in the final game. She had
one ace and eight of the 16

kills she racked up in. the
match were in the final game,
as Pitt turned more toward its
outside hitting.

“We have to get [the bal-
anced, middle-oriented attack]
happening the entire match,”
Braziel said.

Pitt continued to have trouble
getting all phases of the game
working at once.

“If we can get everyone play-
ing well at the same time,
we’re going to be unstop-
pable,” Braziel said.

“Right now, some people
have good matches and some
people don’t.”

One reason is the sideline,
where redshirt junior outside
hitter Carrie Thornton has been
the past week with a sprained
ankle.

“Having Carrie out hurts us,
and our depth is not helping
us,” Braziel said.

Depth was expected to be a
luxury the Panthers would have
this season —— one they never
had before -— until the injuries
hit. With Yanik back, the bench
could be getting where it was
supposed to be for Pitt.

“If [Yanik] gets in [and] Carrie
gets healthy  Sarah Mikla can
contribute in a lot of ways 
all of a sudden, we_ have a lot
of depth  a lot of talent,”
Braziel said.

SERVES AND VOLLEYS:
This weekend the Panthers hit
the road yet again, this time for
the Buffalo Tournament in
Buffalo, New York. They face
New Mexico Friday night. They
open Saturday’s play against
Hofstra, victim to a three-game
pasting by Pitt Sept. 17, and
finish up with Buffalo that
night.

Rugby  
trounces
Vulcans

By Brett Fondrk
Staff‘ Writer

With a playoff appear-
ance hanging in the bal-
ance, Pitt rugby traveled
to California State
University of
Pennsylvania and crushed
the Vulcans 27-3.

The first half opened
with Pitt playing sloppy
but still dominating the
action. Sean Tonkin drew
first blood by booting a
penalty kick through the

' uprights to make the
score 3-0.

As the first half pro-
gressed, the sluggish
Panthers began to come
alive. A penalty was
called against Cal State
(Pa.), and the Panthers
prepared to kick. Senior
Ed Davis saw that the Cal
State (Pa.) players weren’t
paying attention and
alertly picked up the ball
an.d dashed into the try
zone untouched.

r The extra point was
good, and the stunned
Vulcans were down 10-0.

The Panthers dorninat-
ed the first half action and
kept Cal bottled up in its
own end. It would only
get worse as the Panthers
seemed? to get stronger as
the game progressed.Cal
scored its only points of
the game at the beginning
of the second half by
converting a. penalty kick
that cut the deficit to 10-3.

After a sloppy first half,
the Panther offense finally
came alive and dashed
any hopes that Cal had of
an upset. Pitt quickly took
advantage of a Cal mis-
take. John Lewis picked

_ up a loose ball that a Cal

player had bobbled and
scrambled into the try
zone untouched. Tonkin

and the score was 17-3.

The onslaught contin-
ued when the Panthers
scored their second try of
the half. The score came
after Brian Vahosky and
Chris Fortin worked their
way through the Cal
defense. As he was being
tackled, Fortin ﬂipped the
ball to Vahosky who took
the ball in for the try.

_Though the conversion
failed, Cal looked beat at

. 22-3. Ed Davis put the fin-
ishing touches on the
Panther blowout by run-

_ ning in hissecond try of
the day. The kick failed,
and Cal was on the short
end of a 27-3 score.

With the win, the
Panthers clinched second
place in the B division,
and more importantly,
gained a post-season
playoff berth.

The Pitt Panther soccer team
marched off the field with
clenched fists, tight jaws and

_ stern looks after the Boston

College Eagles jammed in the
game-winning goal with 56 sec-

onds left to play, allowing the in

visitors to.escape Pitt Stadium
with a 2-1 win yesterday.

The gut—wrenching goal came
courtesy,ofc Boston College
junior Brian Siracusa’s shot
from two yards out that deflect-
ed off Panthers’ goalie Kirk
Brodows and in for the score.

Up to ‘that fateful point, the

game appeared bound for

overtime.

“It was a really bad way to ;

lose,” senior Ted Noethling
said.

The Panthers initial reaction 

was to dispute the controversial
goal

When the play began, Paul
Fahey lifted a crossing pass to
Siracusa. After the
bounced off of Brodows, it was
directed to Pitt defender John
Lopus, who was standing on
the goal line. Lopus extended
his right foot into the goal and

cleared the ball away. The ref-, J

eree signaled a goal and the
Panthers showed their frustra-
tion.

“I don’t know if it was in or
not,” Noethling said.

“John Lopus tried to clear it. I
guess they said it was in  I
didn’t really see it,” Brodows
said.

It was an unfortunate out-
come for Pitt and, in particular,
the defense, which had staved
off a formidable BC frontline

that not only included,eight-

goal scorer Siracusa but six-
foot, five-inch forward Marius
Lund. _

“I let two goals in  we
played well, they played bet-

ter,” Brodows said. “Every time

therewas a crossing pass

[Lund] would win it. He had

four inches on everyone else.
They were veryskilled up
front.” '

Pitt actually took control of
the game early in the first half
when Noethling scored off a
Mike Dyer feed.

Dyer, looking like a running-
back breaking out of the pack,
suddenly found himself open
after juking two defenders and
left a great pass for a streaking

Noethling.vNoethling put a blis-

tering shot on goal that hit a
defender and dribbled into the
net for a 1-0 Pitt lead.

“We had worked on the short
corner play in practice,”
Noethling said. “Mike left an
absolutely perfectpass  I
shot it, and luckily, it went in.”

The game was scoreless in
the second half before
Siracusa’s fateful goal, but both
teams had every opportunity to
knock the other out.

Eagle forward Paul Keegan
started a nail-biting sequence in
which Pitt survived two shots

Keegan snapped a shot over
his head, with his back facing
the goal», that ricocheted-off
the corner of the crossba.r to
BC teammate Steve Johnson.
Johnson put a header on goal
that also hit the crossbar
before the Panthers were final-
ly able to clear the ball.-

At the 72:00 mark, Brodows
robbed Lund of a sure goal by
extending his leaping body
just enough to tap the header
away. 7

Pitt had an outstanding
chance to score in the second
half when Eric Prex and Jeff
Porter put on a passing clinic
on a two-on-two fastbreak.
However, with Boston College
goalie Chris Bauer spralled out
on the turf, Porter fanned on
the shot wide right.

"It was a very, very tough
loss,” Pitt Coach Joe Luxbacher
said. "We lost to a- top team.
We were hoping to get a point
out of this at least.”

Boston College Coach Ed
Kelly was thoroughly upset
with the play of the game and
also with the officiating.

"It was an ugly way to win a
game,” Kelly said. “It was the
absolute worst officiating I had
ever seen. I thought it was dis-
gusting.

“It was disgraceful the way
we played.”

Gonzalez's entry just makes Pitt Q

By Jason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

' SOUTH BEND, IN — \‘(/hen the Pitt
Panthers entered the 1995 football sea-
son, they had two quarterbacks fighting
for one job. ,

But after five games in which nobody

.has played as if they even remotely-

want the responsibility of directing this
offense, the situation has turned into
Complete disarray.

John Ryan, who supposedly won the

_ starting job out of preseason and has.

garnered most of the playing time for
Pitt, was completely ineffective Saturday
against Notre Dame and was replaced
by signal caller Pete Gonzalez*—— a

rookie making the first start of his"

C2ll'CCl'.

Gonzalezs response?

Zero—fo’r-three for no passing yards,
no rushing yards (negative two, actual-
ly) and, though he was inserted to pro-
vide a bit of a boost, absolutely no
spark.

Nothing.

“I never imagined myselfto be in a

situation like this,’7 Gonzalez said.

"The crowd and stuff dicln’t phase me.

XX/hat phased me was that I tried to

think too hard.”

' Whether or not it was good for
Gonzalez to get his first dose of medi-
cine from such a mammoth power

remains to be seen, but Majors had all

intentions of using him in this game.
“We had decided to play Gonzalez

this week to see what he could do,” he
said. “It might not have been a good sit—
uation to put him in, but we did not
have many good situations.”

How true. Former starting and now
third-string quarterback Ken Ferguson

end several times because Pitt just didn’t

have enough healthy receivers to play,
a statistic that may show how far this

program has fallen better than any
other.
And now even though the die has

finally been cast — many speculated
that Gonzalez would be redshirted for

the season — the situation remains as
confused as it has been all year, but

now with a third party involved.

“Our quarterback situation is a weekly
thing,” Gonzalez said.

“One week John does great or Ken
does great. It’_s a weekly thing, and [the
coaching staff] is telling me to wake up
and start challenging for a starting job.”

The job, which now belongs to Ryan,
could change hands quickly and perma-
nently if he plays much like he did in
the first half.

After their opening series — a typical
Pitt three-and-out —-— the Panthers put
together a modest, but_ nonetheless,
promising drive:

Running back Curtis Martin rushed for I

yards, giving Pitt a first-and-10 from

rybook breakthrough
scenario, Gonzalez was

progress the past two
weeks in the first half,”
Majors said following the
game. “In the second
half, we got worn down
 like last week.”

Last week Pitt led
unbeaten Louisville 7-6
before succumbing 29-7.

“We don’t match up
with anybody,” Majors
said.

Of the Panthers’ futility,
most can be attributed to
the offense, which held
the ball all of nine min-
utes and 20 seconds of
the second half.

“We didn’t do anything
on‘ offense that gave us a
prayer or as much as a
chance,” Majors said.” 0

Pitt’s defense, which
held ND to a respectable
13 first-half points, was
forced again and again to
stop the vaunted Irish
ground game. Needless
to say, it didn’t.

That pleased Notre-
Dame head coach Lou
Holtz.

“The second half, we
dominated the game,”
Holtz said. “Our backs
ran better.the second
half. [Running back Ray]
Zellars, [quarterback Paul]
Failla  did a really nice
job against [Pitt].

“We couldn’t maintain
some things in the first
half, but I really feel this

team is going to
improve.

While Holtz saw
improvement in his

offense, Majors saw the
opposite. And did some-
thing about.

Something called frosh
quarterback Pete
-Gonzalez.

In his first duty ever as
a Panther, Gonzalez got a
big—time taste of Division
I college football against
the Fighting Irish —
going 0-for-3 passing and
throwing an interception
on his first ever pass at
Pitt. He also rushed four
times for a net total of
minus two yards. 0

Debut woes aside,
Gonzalez was blunt
about why things went
so wrong offensively for
the Panthers.

“They were just quicker
than we were,” Gonzalez
said. “We tried to prepare
for them, but it’s not the
same”

Cochran’s booting
exploits:

A sure-fire sign—of—the-
desperation times, Pitt’s
top effort Saturday came
from frosh punter Nate
Cochran, who found
himself quite busy
against Notre Dame.

Cochran, who started
the year as backup to
Kevin Leon, had eight
punts for 349 yards — a
stellar average of 43.6
yards per punt.

“It seemed like we were get-
ting the plays in too late, and it
was real hectic and rushing,”
Ryan said of the series.

“We were real concerned
about their cornerblitzes, and I
think I was paying too much
attention to that. I just worried
about this defense.”

“I’m almost certain that there
was no problem getting the
play on the field,” Majors said.
“There is no reason why it
should happen.”

But if Ryan and Ferguson

have reached their error limit,
and Gonzalez is finally going to
get his reps, where does that
put things?

“I have no idea,” Ryan said.
“The way [the substitution] hap-
pened in the second half, if it
was Coach Majors or Coach
Karcher of the whole staff, I’m
not sure what's going on.

"I’m supposed to sit out a
series, and maybe another one.
But when I.didn’t go in the rest
of the game, I mean were we
just giving up. The game wasn’t
so far out of reach."

But the days, few as they
may be, when Ryan’s job was
secure might be over.

His persistently dismal per-
formances and Gonzalez’s first
start may have opened the
door for what could be the
program’s future quarterback. A
situation that, as far as Majors
concerned, will have to hap-
pen.

“We plan to play [Gonzalez]
for the rest of the season,” Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors said.

"I-Iow much or how he will
fit into the rotation, I don’t
know.”

instills in students feelings of safety, security, and general wellness not unlike those experienced’

to the Citibank'Photocard, the only credit card with your photo on it. A voiceiinside says, “This
is me, really me.” (As opposed to, “Who the heck is that?”—a common response to the" photo
on one’s driver’s license.) 'It’s an immediate form of
ID, a boost to your self—image. ‘ll Of course if your card is

ever lost or stolen and a stranger is prevented from using it,

  

you’ll feel exceptionally good (showing no signs of Credit

services, such as The Lost Wallet‘”‘ Service that can replace
