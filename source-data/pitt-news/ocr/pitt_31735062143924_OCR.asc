By Chancellor

- Men and women of the gradu-
ating class “of 1949 gathered in the
Stephen Foster’ memorial, Wed-
nesday , {September 19, for the
Chancellorfs Reception. The pro-
gram was-zheld at 1:30 o’clock.
‘ Speakingforfnally to the incom-
ing freshjnen for the ﬁrst time
this fall, ~Cha’ncellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald. said, “More than 40%
of the freshmen were in the upper
ﬁfth of their high school graduat-
ing classés.” His talk dealt with
the fact that- this ﬁgure would
enable the freshmen to see they
would allfhave ‘a deﬁnite challenge
in regard *,to maintaining good
grades, that the future holds a
stimulating‘ opportunity for them,
and that therelare unlimited pos-
sibilities’ in Pitt's scholars’ ﬁeld.
“While you are here,” he con-

tinued, “the Cathedral of Learn-

ing, the"‘Comrnon’s room, Foster
memorial,” -and Heinz chapel

‘should all serve as an "inspiration

to you.” He urged the freshman

-women to‘: liveup to the ideals
‘ embodiedby these structures.

‘Dr. James Hartley Beal, pro-
fessor emeritus of the School-of
Pharmacy, University of Pitts-
burgh and father of Dr. George
Benton Beal, assistant director -of
the Mellon Institute died in his
home in Fort Walton, Florida,

For many years, Dr. Beal was
one of the leading ﬁgures in

American pharmacy having serv-

Dr. Alexander J. Allen
Allen Reports
Cyclotron
Under Way

;Pittsburgh is about to become
the home of a radio-activity cen-
ter, -for a cyclotron is now in the
course of construction. on our own
Pitt campus. 9

“Within the next few years
utilization of radio-active mate-
rials produced by the cyclotron
will -contribute beneﬁts beyond
our present powers of reckoning,”
declares Dr. Alexander J. Allen,
noted scientist in charge of the
cyclotron being built at the Uni-
versity. ‘

He says, “The property of radio-
activity has opened apparently
unlimited possibilities for research
in medicine, biology, chemistry,
physics, and in many ﬁelds of in-
dust.ry.”

Contrary to popular belief, the
cyclotron is housed beside the Old
Mellon Institute in the same small
brick -building as the control room.
However, the room in which the
cyclotron will -be when completed
is covered on the top and three
sides with earth for this part of
the building extends into the hill-
side. The fourth side facing the
control room will be a solid wall
of water when the ma-chine is in
operation. “Without such protec-
tion as the earth and water, any-
one who stood in the immediate
vicinity for a relatively short ti-me
would be seriously injured,” said
Dr. Allen, who is the Westing-
house graduate professor of Engi-
neering at Pitt.

He said ‘further, “The cyclotron
has two» purposes. First, it is a
means of determining the charac-
teristics of the nuclei of atoms;
second, it generates artiﬁcial ra-
dio—active materials, called “tag-
ged’_’ atoms, which can be detected
in very small quantitie.s———as small
as one millionth of a billionath of
an ounce.” _

This is not Dr. Allenfsi ﬁrst ex-
perience with this fabulous in-
strument. He built one for the
Franklin Insti=tute at the Bartol
Foundation in Swarthmore. This
cyclotron was moved to the Bi-
ochemical Research Foundation in
Newark, "Delaware, where Dr.
Allen was assistant director.

From Newark, Dr. Allen came
to Pitt. But he is‘ not new here.
In 1940, after a two year stay at
the University as associate pro-
fessor of physics, Dr. Allen left
to go to the Radiation Laboratory
at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where, as a staff
member, he did ‘research on radar.

Money to build the cyclotron
and the buildingwhich houses it
was donated by Mrs. Allen Scaife.

Quick Announces

Enrollment Figures

During the registration week of September 18 to September 22,
the University of Pittsburgh enrolled 6,892 students, according to Dr.

J. G. Quick, University registrar.

These ﬁgures are given as of the close of the regular registration

period:

1201 undergraduate freshmen as compared with 787 at the same

period last year.

The increase is 414 or 52.6%.

“That appears to be the largest¢

undergraduate freshman class on
record,” Dr. Quick said. “In:1940—
41, the freshman. registration was
1938. In 1930—’3'1, the year of our
largest enrollment until now, the
ﬁgure was 1171.”

The undergraduate sophomore
enrollment for this semester was
591- as compared with 316 of last
year. 0

Undergraduate juniors. now
number 439 against 378 of last
year, and there are 366 under-
graduate seniors. Last year at this
time, the number of undergrad-
uate seniors was 276.

Ninety unclassed and special
students are in the university now,
a favorable ﬁgure when compared
to the 65 of last year.

In total, the undergraduate
group numbers 2687. Last year,
the number of undergraduates was
1822.

The enormity of this year’s reg-
istration can be determined by the
following ﬁgures:

Tuesday‘ registration total: 374
day students.

Wednesday: 1426 day and even-
ing students. ,

Thursday: 1385 day and even-
ing students.

Friday: l597 day and evening
students. '

Saturday: 1310 day and evening
students.

“In a total of about 47 hours,”
Dr. Quick said, “we registered
6,892 students or about 130 an
hour. .

“It was an extremely busy
week,” he continued. “The num-
ber of students who actually en-
rolled exceeded the predictions es-
tablished during the pre-registra-
tion period of admission. Sections
closed rapidly. New sections were
added hourly. In spite of the
diﬁiculties imposed by the in-
creased numbers, the faculty ren-
dered exceptional advisory service,
and they are to be commended for
their good work. This word of
praise is due also to the mem-
bers of the staffs of the offices of
the deans’, treasurer’s, and regis-
trar’s.”

According to Dr. Quick, the
1201 freshman men and women
are distributed in the various
schools as follows:

The College: 792 as compared
with 610 of last year-—an increase
of 182 students.

Engineering and Mines: 184 as
compared with 86 of last year——an
increase of 98 students.

First Chapel Service
Conducted This Friday

The traditional Chapel Services
that takes place every Friday in
the Heinz chapel at one o’clock
will be observed again this year,
with the ﬁrst service, Friday, Sep-
tember 28. Dr. Farmer, University
chaplain, will be the speaker
again this year.

Among students participating in
the initial service will be Robert
Delasin, who will act as student
leader, and Norma Ebersole, who
will sing a solo.

Mr. Fred Lotz, University or-
ganist, will be at the organ. The
service will conclude at 1:25 p. m.
All students are urged to attend.

Experts Speak
On Spectroscope

Even though the camera cannot
lie, its accuracy ca.n be question-
ed in the c-ase of spectroscopy or
the analysis of matter from the
rays given oﬁ. Since spectroscopy
analyzes everything from -stru.c- .-
tural steel to war materials and.
since its results are recorded
photographically, accuracy is of
great importance. %

A day’s conference on applied
spectroscopy’ will be held by the
physics department of the Univer-
sity Saturday, September 29 in
the Mellon Institute. The accuracy

‘ of records on p-hotographic plates

used‘ in; spectroscopy‘ will be dis-
cussed.

Dr. G. H. Dieke of John-Hop-
kins university will speak on the
use of photomultiplier tubes in-
stead of photographic plates in the
measurement of spectrum .lines.
Dr. Jacob Sherman of the United
States Navy Yard, Philadelphia,
will talk on accuracy and preci-
sion as applied to the plates.

Literary Club
To Meet

The ﬁrst meeting of Women’s
Speech association will be tomor-
row, September 27, at 2:30 o’clock,
it has been announced. All upper-
class. women interested in poetry-
reading, public speaking, verse
choir work, and forum discussion
are invited to attend. “It is not
necessary to have been in a speech
class at the University to become
a member of speech,” said Penn
Burke, president of the WSA.

The meeting will be a get-ac-
quainted affair and is open to all
women who would like to p-artici—
pate in speech activities on the
campus. “It is most important,”
Penn Burke emp‘hasized, “that all
speech members be present in or-
der to determine points earned last
year. As soon as these records are
tabulated-, Speech Activities Keys
will be awarded.”

Also to be discussed at the meet-
ing is the program of poetry and
forums for the year. Plans for an
active year will be formulated.’ and
speech assignments given out. The
meeting will close promptly at
3:30. (Room number will be post-
ed on the bulletin board.) A '

Fine Arts Display Open
On Seventh Floor

The Fine Arts Gallery is fea-
turing for the next few weeks,
a collection on Chinese Flower
Pain-tings of the Eighteenth Cen-
tury. The -collector, Mr. Lo-o-, a
foremost authority on Chinese
paintings, has loaned. the Univer-
sity this group of paintings. with
the hope that it will not only be
of special help to botany majors
of Pitt but will be of interest to
all the students.

Most of the paintings depict the

Chinese love of nature by show- Q

ing ﬂowers, birds and the artists’
conception of nature done in fan-
tasy. Some of the drawings are
done on paper; others are done on
ﬁne silk. . M s

“Here is eternal spring. For you the very stars of heaven

are new.” _

The purpose of the founding of the University is well ex-
pressed by this inscription upon the wrought iron gates lead-
ing into the Commons Room. Each student is encouraged to
seek his own particular way and to achieve the utmost that his
ability, intelligence, character, and personality will let him
accomplish. Beautiful creations such as the Stephen Foster
Memorial, Heinz Chapel, and the Cathedral of Learning, con-
vey the material value of education and also lend themselves to
injecting the spirit of education into the student. Thus, the
ideals of higher learning are always kept in sight and the drive
towards them progresses every day.

However, we are ever conscious of the prejudices that arise
and block the pathway to the stars. Usually these prejudices
are either religious or racial. Often our prejudices are held
against others merely because of dislike, and it is at this point
we should remember that lack of reason for our feelings re-
ﬂects on our -own character. We should realize that the success
of one man or woman makes possible the success of another man
or woman. In no instance then, should we repress the ability
or intelligence of man so that he can not attain what he is
rightly entitled to.

Perhaps you are wondering what all of this has to do with
us at Pitt. Here is the answer. Pitt is deﬁnitely an urban Uni-
versity; which means in turn, that the student body has always
been diversiﬁed. For illustration review the enrollment Pitt
has today. First of all there is the group of seventeen year olds;
a group of young boys and girls who instead of ﬁnishing out the
last semester of their senior year in high school have entered
college early. They wish to waste no time in getting their
“start” in life. Next, consider the impressive number of men
and women who have enrolled for courses under the GI. Bill
of Rights. The number is great, and is composed of men and
women who are of all ages, and come from all walks of life.
There are the “civilian” students, the fortunate ones who car-
ried on a regular college career through the war days. Also,
we ﬁnd businessmen, not having the time to attend day school,
ﬁlling out schedules for evening classes, and still others in grad-
uate school working for a mas.ter’s or doctor’s degree.

It would be most unnatural if some prejudices did not re-
sult from such a congregation of beings!

During the war we assumed the “all for one, one for all”
attitude. We cast prejudices aside,’ and united -for the cause.
But now, since the ties of war have been loosened, are we going
The unity
which held our University together, and strengthened us through
the “dark days.”

We must not allow old prejudices to sneak up on us and
create disturbance within our ranks. The ﬁres of individualism
will smoulder if we neglect to sweep the cold ashes of the pas.t
oﬁ the hearth, the sparks of enthusiasm will fade into bitter re-
sentment.

Let us all remember then, to be more considerate and re-
spectful of each other. We will not only be helping others, but
also ourselves to reach our “lucky stars.” '

(Ed. Note: The Pitt News is
turning its journalistic eye on the
University’s war veterans with
particular interest this year. We
feel they are bound to become
important and outstanding in
scholarship and activities in the
coming two semesters and that a
great deal of our news will be
their doings. In their interests, we
intend to print articles such as
the following from time to time.
This one concerns Purdue Univer-
sity. We hope, by this, the veter-
ans will be able to compare the agi-
vctntages oyffered to them by Pitt
with those of other universities.)

‘WEST ‘LAFAYETTE, IND. —
*(ACP)—‘S‘tep-s have been taken at
the University to help -former
students being discharged from
the -armed services and also those
being displaced by the closing of
war plants, to -ﬁnd jobs in ﬁelds
for which they have been trained.
Announcement of «the program
was made recently by Acting
President A. A. Potter following
a conference with officers of the
personnel and placement divi-
-sions and other University ofﬁcers
concerned with the placement of
graduates, an-d former students.

For more than two years. F. L.
Cason, -assistant director of per-
sonnel, has kept in touch with
ﬁrms that normally come to the
-campus t-o employ University
graduates. He also has contacted
many other -companies, between
5040 an-d 16200 in all, to ascertain
their post-war needs for trained
men and women.

Cason, with Harold W. Cope,
special consultant of the personnel
staff, and who has had wi-de ex-
perience in industry, together,
have direct contact with these
companies and will serve as the
center for the placement of re-
turning veterans who went di-
rectly from the University. into
the armed forces and do not have
jobs to which to return, as well
as many others who went to war
industries which are reconvert-
ing.

The Alumni Oﬁice will cooper-
ate in the pr-oject by advising its
l0c.al alumni clu-b ofﬁcers. in vari-
ous cities over the state and nation
of ﬁrms that need men or women
with the type of training offered
at the University. Letters telling
the alumni club leaders of the
plan are going out now and
through a coordinated pnogram the
University expects to be of direct
help in reducing unemployment of
its graduates.

“Purdue has always had an
extremely high employment rate
for its men women,” said Dr.
Potter, “but with many coming
back from the armed services and
many more well trained men and
women temporarily out of work
by the neconversion program, we
feel it is essential for our person-
nel -and placement services to be
of help to those Purdue men and
women wh-o may be looking for
a position. ‘That is why we are
urging anyone in either of these
groups to -Contact -the personnel

Baer Reports
On Results

Of Conference

New York, N. Y.—(I.P.)‘——The‘

effect of Bretton Woods, Dum-
barton Oaks, and San Francisco
has already made itself felt in the
college curriculum it was revealed
in a report of Dean William B.
Baer of the New York University
College of Arts and Pure Science.

Dean Baer reported that the
University College would inaug-
urate this fall a social science pro-,
gram to equip young men with the
economic, political, and social
problems of the postwar tworld.
Emphasis will be placed on a
thorough knowledge of related
ﬁelds rather than training for a
particular job, the report stated.

“Regardless of the outcome of
the present and future world con-
ferences, complex problems are
certain to arise which will require
the services of men of vision, of
intellectual vigor, and perhaps
above all of adaptability and Ver-
satility,” Dean Baer said.

“For this reason we will at-
tempt only incidentally to train
students enrolled in the new pro-
gram to ﬁllparticular jobs. We
think that we can best serve them
by equipping them with a thorough
knowledge of their chosen ﬁelds
and with a solid foundation for
intellectual and vocational ad-
vancement.

“The program will be sufficient-
ly varied and ﬂexible to provide
thorough undergraduate prepara-
tion within each of the ﬁelds of
international affairs, public ad-
ministration, social welfare, labor
economics, ﬁnance and banking,
business management, marketing,
general economics, and pre—law,”
Dean Baer continued.

“Most important, however, will
be the ‘assimilation of liberal arts
objectives with professional train-
‘mg. Public administration, for ex-
ample, will take account of poli-
tical considerations and social ob-
jectives as well as problems of or-
ganization and of administrative
procedures.

“Marketing, though dealing with
methods and techniques, will be in
a larger sense a study in the eco-
nomics of distribution. Manage-
ment will consider the best meth-
ods of utilizing machines and man-
power from the point of View not
only of proﬁt but also of social
advantages. And a young man
who is contemplating a career in
international relations must be
schooled in a variety of ﬁelds.

“The s.tud.»ent’s knowledge will
be anchored to past experience by
historical courses and strengthen-
ed by comparative studies of for-
eign institutions. In advanced
work his grasp of the ﬁeld will
be coordinated and Ifortiﬁed by
courses on the development and
present statusgof economic and
political theory. He may still fol-
low the customary procedure of
special‘ization, or, he may, by cut-
ting across. departmental lines,
concentrate in a ﬁeld of knowledge
which includes» work in several
departments.”

Thus this curriculum will rec-
oncile the current demand for
vocational training with the tra-
ditional objectives and standards
of a liberal arts college.

Books Added
To Library

It is hoped by the library staff
that new students will -come to
know the Alldred Room situated,
on the sixth floor. However main-
ly because i-t is in an obscure
location it has been unintention-
ally a‘v-oided by most students. A
trip to this corner will reveal many
interesting an-d -delightful as well
as informative books, for the avid
book-worm. Subjects of current
interest will make it a worthw,hi1e
inspection. - a

From the many challenging
books on current affairs are such
thought provoking scripts as Ro-
land .Sh.arp’s “South America. Un-
censored,” L. K. Ro«singer’s
“China’s Crisis,” Eidgar Snow’s
“The Pattern of Soviet Power,”
and Alexander Leighton’s “The
Governing of Men,” a study of
the internment camps. for Japan-
ese Americans. -«

Th ree new autolbiographies
should furnish potent reading ma-
terial; Henry ‘Miller’s. accoun-t'_of
his life with Alice Duer ‘Miller in
“All of Our Lives,” Leon. Sumne-
1ian’s “I Ask You, Ladies -and.

should be o-f great interest to fac-

who were colleagues or former

‘LEAVES THE GROUND

A bomber crew needs training as a team. And now
those hazards which are too dangerous for air-borne
drill can be duplicated on the ground. This is made
possible by an electronic ﬂight trainer perfected by
Bell Telephone ‘Laboratories’ scientists for the Navy.

At remote controls the instructor follows the
“ﬂight,” sets up various dangerous conditions, coor-
dinates the crew’s reactions. 1

7/-final

By Burke and Burcher

Well, how-dy. What’s the mat-
ter? Such a long face? And so
early in the season! Girl trouble
maybe, or no locker, and less
books, or possibly something real-
ly serious like not being able to
get into the Tuck shop around
12:32 o’clock?

Well, then, just you come on
along and forg-et all your troubles
at Monday luncheon. Everybody
comes to Monday lunch; it’s at
12:30 o’clock on the -iﬁrst Monday
of each month "(October 1 this
month) Soldiers and Sailors Me-
morial hall. The price is only 35
cents, and oh, that elegant food!
Served up mind you, by the best
looking freshman men you ever
saw. This is straight because I
met one of them today, and umm!
(Sorry, Chuck, but I needed that
extra line of copy.)

Oh yes, big point: be sure to
sign up for Monday Luncheon at
either the YMCA ofﬁce on the 8th
ﬂoor or the YWCA oﬂice on the
12th ﬂoor. We’ll expect all of you
freshmen and upper-classmen
alike at Monday Lunch.

Another date to remember on
your calendar is the ﬁrst chapel
service at 1:00 o’clock this Friday.
Dr. Farmer will speak and Norma
Ebersole will sing a solo. The ‘lo-
cale is the Heinz Chapel.

‘Third important event is the
YM-YW Conference at Caro~nda—
wanna on the 5-, 6, and 7 of Oc-
tober. There’ll be singing, and
dancing, and “partifying,” and
some really good discussion. Fresh-
men and upper-classmen alike can
come, and the price is within
every~b~ody’s reach, a nominal $3.50
for a wonderful week-end. Bus
transportation will be provided,
though the tickets are not includ-
ed in' the price -of the week end.
So, iﬂ you have your own trans-
portation (we mean a car, you
big lug) so much the better. And,
if that single corpuscle hasn’t yet
recovered from the last confer-
ence, it’s advisable to bring] your
own blankets. So there, don't say
we didn’t warn you!

At this point, something for YM
alone (Of course Steve has been
beating me over the head with a
large club for the past fifteen
minutes.)

Here’s a notice to all freshman
men. There will be a meeting of
the Freshman Club Thursday,
September 27, at 12:3-O in the YM
lounge. It’s going to be interest-
ing: date technique and stuff. Need
we say more?

Alfred Is Bac
For Players

“Pitt Players are the craziest
people on earth!” exclaimed Al-
fred the Stephen Foster mouse.
“Why honestly, no sane person
would ever think of starting work
this early in the semester.” This

was gleaned from a personal in ,

terview among the rafters of
Stephen Foster memorial. Armed
with a large piece of cheese, I
tempted Alfred to onelof the low-'
er beams early this week. ‘

“Of course, the food situation
is better. One can pick’ up a tid-
bit here and there since the Play-
ers are back. But goshffor a time
it was awful. “All my relatives
moved in. from the it Mess hall.

“But now, ahh, it’s different.
Why I c-an just smell grease paint

ﬂats fumbling out of storage.” At

this point Alfred assumed a Ham-
let-like air, and I waved a small
piece of ham (thréevvvpoints a
pound in front of ;his,.nose.
Instantly, he galvanized to at-
tention. “As I was ‘saying the
Players are meetingiin‘ 7G—24 this

is, they will be, '.if ‘Biology lab
doesn't interfere. Any how .I’m

Fixed with Alfred's mousy stare,
I stamrriered that I hadn’t plan-
ned on it. “Well be°there,” he
roared. “Every body’s_eoming, and
even if you can only scrub ﬂoors
the Players can use you!” Hiding
my dissh-pan hands  proniised
solemnly to attend, and folding
my spiral notebook, I disappeared.

Crouch Writes to Pitt

About England

-1 Word has been received from Associate Professor of English, Dr.
W‘; George Crouch, one of the four Pitt professors who have begun

teaqlting assignments in the Army’s
lavndgand France.

University Study Centers in Eng-

In, his letter to former Pitt colleagues, Dr. Crouch said, “This
trip to England is a regular Cook’s tour. It has exceeded my most

optirnistiic expectations. In the ﬁrst¢

place, we had a voyage on the
Queen Elizabeth that almost
equaled what it would have been
in ‘peace time. If I hadn’t seen the
gun‘ emplacements on deck and
hadn’t had to report for lifeboat
drill each morning, I would have
ithoijidght myself on a regular pleas-
ure ’ cruise.”

He further related, “The gran-d
surprisle of the trip was that we
took’ the northern route past the

and not unlike "those to be found

Dr. «Crouch. is teaching two

classes in speech an-d will give a
seminar in the Romantic Poets o-f
the Early Nineteenth Century. He
may later act as an announcer
for programs beamed to the U.S.,
programs designed to let the fami-
lies and friends of our boys over
there, kn-ow what they are doing
and how they are getting along.
These interview-like programs are
then put on records and trans-
mitted via radio to the U.S. Dr.
Crouch is also helping to organize
debating teams among the boys
and is looking forward to a de-
bate conference in Paris with the
team at Ar-my University Center
No. 2.

Pitt Tackles IMountaineers On Stadium Turf, Sat.

 I Jungle Cats Primed

For Ancient Rivals

By Allan Roth
With sixty minutes of varsity experience gained in the Illinois
tilt, under their belts, Clark Shaughnessy’s Pitt Panthers look for-
ward with much optimism to their forthcoming battle with the in-

vading Mountaineers of West Virginia university.

The West Vir-

ginians, who will tangle with the Panthers this Saturday afternoon
will be the ﬁrst of eight opponents to be met on the home turf this

S€8.SO1'1.

The Pittites, in meeting the men of Morgantown, will be

playing host to one of the oldest¢

rivals in this school’s athletic
history. In recent years the Gold-
on Panthers haven’t encountered
too much trouble in over-taking
their advensaries from the state
sbordering south. The Panthers
own -a clean sweep over their an-
eient -opponents in the last ﬁfteen
years. In that period of time Pitts-
burgh met an-d tripped the enemy
twelve times, never a victory with
less than at least a two touch-
down margin. The series was tem-
porarily halted in the years 19410-
42 and resumed with a 2-0-0 result
in favor of the Skyscraper Uni-
versity 120/’43 and a repeat con-

I ~ questof 26-13 last fall.

lege eleven last Saturday after-
noon. The ‘Morg.antown mentor is
faced with the same task as Clark
Shaughnessy is in that he is forced
to build a team from decidedly
green material. West Va. U. has

always maintained the choice of
most of the graduating grid stars
from the s-tate’s finest high school

By Larry Bondy, Sports Editor

A Little Support, Please

Another year, another football season, and another Big Nine loss
in the record book. In spite of our initial defeat, nine games remain.
in which to demonstrate our unswerving support of the local eleven.
We all know that the Panthers again ﬁeld a relatively inexperienced
and untried team, however our tilt with the powerful Illinois team
has given Coach Shaughnessy an invaluable insight on our boys
which will be put to practical use in the remaining contests. For
anyone who listened to the game, or read the accounts the following
day, it was apparent that the Panthers surprised everybody by their
tenacious defensive plays against a vastly superior and highly touted
Illinois eleven.

Saturday Pitt will meet the University of West Virginia on our
home grounds. This will be our ﬁrst opportunity to display our ﬁght-
ing spirit by cheering the Panthers on to victory. We may not make
the Rose Bowl this season, but a new and powerful Pitt team is in
the everyday making. Let’s go all out for Pitt.

Luck

Two weeks ago, after the usual morning practice Coach Shaugh-
nessy predicted that the team with the most luck will win the Pitt-
Illinois contest. Last Saturday’s game proved that was right. As
Skladany stepped into the end zone during the ﬁrst few minutes of
play a sheer twist of fate caused him to lose the ball momentarily
after his punt had been blocked and the Illini recovered for their
ﬁrst score.

A ﬁfteen yard penalty in the ﬁrst quarter placed the ball on our
one—yard line enabling the opponent to score. The conversion made
the score 9 to 0. In spite of Pitt’s dogged defense in the next three
quarters, Pitt was outclassed and it just wasn’t our day.

Basketball Season Under Way Soon

Dr. H. C. Carlson plans to unveil his ’45 proteges on the court
early this fall. With the inﬂux of freshmen, many of them experi-
enced players, the genial coach is hoping for one of his best seasons.
Uniforms for last year’s varsity will be issued on Oct. 1, and practice
will get underway on the eighth. The season will be inaugurated
much earlier this year, possibly on December eighth when Pitt meets
Ohio State on their court. Incidentally this will mark the ﬁnal
game for the holiday season. Following this brief respite the "Carl-
sonmen may make an extended tour of the Mid Western circuit
reminiscent of the pre—war days.

Sport Briefs

Prior to last Saturday’s game, the Illini remarked that the Pitt
game would provide a practice workout for their game with Notre
Dame the following week. As it turned out, our opponents utilized
every break, plus beginner’s luck to overcome the Panthers. Bill
Stern, NBC sportscaster, commented that Pitt has a “damn good
team” and emphasized that it will bear watching. A Notre Dame
scout rated Bill Zimmovan the “best back on the ﬁeld.”

Providence, R. I. —- _(I. P.) —
With its projected investment in
the proposed four-million-dollar
student refectory, featuring two
quadrangles ‘for 600 to 700 under-
graduate men, including members
of the fraternities, Brown Uni-
versity has “committeed itself to
the‘perpetuation and strengthen-
ing of the fraternity system,” ac-
cording to President Henry W.
Wriston.

He granted that this policy
“runs counter to signiﬁcant devel-
opments in other colleges, where
there is a strong tendency to chal-
lenge such groupings.” Some crit-
ics of fraternities had. felt they
should be abolished, he said. But,
by “a revolution in student do-
mestic life,” Brown would now
.seek to “encourage the fraterni-
ties to -discharge the high func-
tions whi-ch their rituals» proclaim
as their objective and which ex-
perience has shown they can ap-
proximate und'er proper circum-
stances.” _

Thirteen of the 16 active c-hap-
ters here which owned houses
have thus far deeded their proper-

‘ ties to the University free of debt,

following an invitation by the
Corporation at Brown to do so a
year ago.

Each quadrangle is being plan-
ned to consist of a number of dis-
tinct but connected units, large
enough to accommodate all fra-
ternity men who care to live in
them, but sections of the quad-
rangles will be occupied by non-
fraternity men as well.

The quad-rahgles; are to be so
arranged that the fraternity may
have its chapter room, a lounging

constituting an independent unit

quadrangle with a separate en-

these fraternity rooms were in a
separate house. A fraternity may
have a private dining room, if'it
wishes, in the new refectory
which will be readily accessible
from both quadrangles and from
the older dormitories.

-President Wriston asserted that
the reform initiated by the Brown
Corporation “leaves the basic
character of the fraternities un-
changed. The fraternities will re-
tain everything‘ important in their
individuality —— their enthusiastic
loyalty, their ideals, their taste in
decorating their houses, and their
student activities and intramural
athletics.”

Conspicuous in the new pro-
gram, he said, were “*a vigorous
cooperative effort to free all the
fraternities of debt, move them
out of unsatisfactory houses, re-
lieve the alumni management

neither was in a position effec-
tively to cope) and to unite the

ject, and we willingly pass it,on.
