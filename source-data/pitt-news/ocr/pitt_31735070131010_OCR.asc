On Friday, April 28 of last year, gunshots

rang out across Beaver and Allegheny counties.

In an apparently racially—motivated shooting
spree, Richard Baumhammers killed five people
and critically wounded one in the span of a. few
hours.” .' ' '. 
On Saturday, as the sole survivor of the
crirnereturned’ to Mercy Hospital because; of
complications from the shooting, local poets
staged-' abenefit reading in his honor. , c C

The reading, held at Metropol in the Strip -A :

District,_ featured essayist Geeta K-othari, as well

as « poets Victor
Damian, Jennifer
Dobbs, Kristin
Naca, . Brandon

Som and Lin Wei-
Lee. - i '

Those attending
the show were
asked to donate $5
or more at the door
in order to raise
money toward pur-.
chasing a modified

_van for S andip
Patel, who sur-
vived the April

shooting but lost
the use of hisarms
and legs.

The van would

transported more easily, as he is"now wheel-

In the smoke—filled room, underneath. the
electric glow of black lights and rotating disco
balls, event cosorganizer Wei—Lee stepped on
stage to introduce the first performer.

“Sandip would someday like to go out and
see a movie,” Wei-Lee said before introducing
nationally recognized Chinese‘ ﬂutist Baohuri

Aspiring actors auditioned for parts in ‘What the Hell Were We Thinking?’ last night in the Union.
Pitt’ s Film Club jumps into the
action with first independent film

LESLIE HOFFMAN

Assistant News Editor

“I wish to be  immortalized inicelluloid,”
Alex Donovan joked yesterday as he waited to
audition for an independent film. — -

He added, “I want to have a Humvee out of it,

and a girl under each‘ arm.” .

Donovan, a freshman, joined,50 other poten-

tial movie stars in line yesterday to audition for

an independent filmproduced by Pitt’s Film Club
and June First Productions, a division of the
club. a ‘ I . ‘

Both the movie and June First Productions
are brainchildren of sophomores Jeff Bonnett and
Dennis Curlett. The men were instrumental in the
formation of the Film’ Club last spring and felt
that actually producing a film would be the best
way to educate the club’s novice members.

“We worked on an independent film this sum-_

mer, and we learneda lot more than we did in

.class..The_' film program here isn’t really: geared

toward production. We’re trying "to enhance
everyone’s education,” Bonnett said. A

Bonnett and Curlett collaborated on the
script, affectionately titled, .“What the Hell Were
We Thinking?,’i’, . A. or V ‘ V

‘ ‘‘It’s a working title,” Curlett said. He said he
and Bonnett liked it, butthat they would be inter-
ested in changing the title if they thought of any-
thing better. .

The two men classify the film as “college
comedy.” ' ’ _ ,

“It’s five friends, and it’s the last five days
[on earth], and-it’s what these friends decide to
do with thelast five days,” Curlett said.

' The film will be shot on Pitt’s campus during
Februaryand early March. Bonnett and Curlett
hope to have the film finishedtby the end of the

PITTSBURGH BARTENDER SCHOOL

Staff Writer

While Oprah’s Book Club
makes millionaires out of any
authors featured on her monthly
reports, for some, recreational liter-
ary pursuits are better fulfilled in a
more academic environment.

And though many college stu-
dents find themselves overwhelmed
by enough reading materials to fill a
month of sleepless nights, many

“ find independent literary pursuits —

without the stress of accompanying
essays and tests —— far more enjoy-

- able.

Pitt freshman Justin Eichenlaub,
in conjunction with the University
Honors College, has started a club
to fulfill the needs of those readers
who love to read but want more out
of a book than just a passing grade.
Pitt’s Dead Poet’s Society provides
a chance for students to have an
informal and fun look» at classical
literature.

“Having a discussion group
about books grew out of both the
good and bad English teachers I had
in high school,” Eichenlaub said. “I
admired the teachers who could
keep us turned on to books and
wanted to fix the damage done by
those who turned students off from
them.” ‘ *

The society has just finished
discussing its first book; Kurt
Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse Five”
and plans to move onto James
Joyce’s “A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man.”

' “We chose the books as a
group,” Eichenlaub said. After the

{society issues a verdict, the Honors

College purchases copies of the
book for students to devour and dis-
cuss.

‘The society is an extension of a
10th grade project of Eichenlaub’s,
where he created a Web site devoted
to the study of Homer’s “Iliad” and
“Odyssey.” '

’ Eichenlaub hopes to morph his
original Web site into a much larger
database of scholarly critiques of

novels and poetry by both profes— ‘

sionals and club members.

, But don’t expect to find an elec-
tronic version of Cliffs Notes for
lazy readers hoping to avoid work.

“It won’t be a way to get away
without reading ; the book,”
Eichenlaub said. “The site will be
for people who actually do read the
book and want to go above and
beyond to find out about the themes
of the books. We want to have some
passion infused within it.”

Eichenlaub also hopes to record
the society’s book discussions and
post them on the Web site. The soci-
ety hopes to be able to launch the
Web site in late spring or early sum-
mer depending on members’ sched-
ules.

The Dead Poet’s Society boasts
approximately 15 members, and
new recruits are always welcome.
Eichenlaub said any interested stu-
dent should visit the Honors College
on the 35th floor of the Cathedral of
Learning for more information.

The society meets irregularly
because of the varying lengths of
books members chose to read.

“Obviously a thin book can be
read a lot fas_ter than a large one,”
Eichenlaub said. He said’ the group
understands that accumulating class
workcan cut into members’ reading
time.

“The group doesn’t want to be
one more class,” he said. “Most of
the people are very dedicated and
lovereading, but they know books
are read for fun, not stress.”

Pitt summit examines
health care disparities

REBECCA HUDOCK

The Pitt News

A recent congressional mandate
to establish «a minority health
department in the National
Institutes of Health might prove to

_p be the first step toward eliminating

racial disparities in health care.
For the first time, leaders in the

minority health care field gathered

at Pitt on Jan. 10, 11 and 12 to con-

front an epidemic of inequality fac— .

ing minorities in health care.

The summit, co-sponsored by
the NIH and the Centerrfor Minority
Health in the Graduate School "of
Public Health, brought together
leaders from across the nation with
a\, common goal: to gain a better
understanding of issues related to
racial and ethnic health disparities.

The summit focused on the idea
that even as medical researchers
make life-‘saving advances in dis-
ease control and prevention,
minorities, many whom are eco-
nomically disadvantaged, have yet
to enjoy the progress.

According to the NIH, the death
rate for all cancer patients is 30” per-
cent higher for blacks than it is for

whites. A black person I. is seven
times more likely to die from AIDS
than a white person.

During the summit held at the
University Club, researchers, doc-
tors and public servants discussed
the causes and effects of disparities
in both the research and develop-
ment and administration of health
care’ across the nation.

1 In addition to addressing cause-
and—effect relationships, the con-
versation focused on plans for
direct action.- H

.Summit participants discussed
the need to draft a letter to
Congress, reminding members of
their duty to ensure equal coverage
for all citizens. q

Participants were also encour-
aged to write their ownstate repre-
sentatives.

Dr. Barbara Marin, director of
University of California’s Center
for AIDS Prevention, addressed the
effects of an unequal health care
system for minorities. For instance,
while 86 percent of all new HIV
cases diagnosed are in blacks, only
3 percent of researchers are black.

Pitt professor receives

anonymous writing grant

CHRISTINE CLAIJSI

> StaffWriter
_Sharon McDermott wasn’t

expecting anything special in the
mail the day she opened a letter
awarding her $10,000. _
McDermott, a poetry and gener-
al writing professor at Pitt, received
the anonymous grant for her “out—
standing achievement as an artist,
living and working in the Pittsburgh

. area.”

This honor is awarded to three
artists a year involved in either the-
ater, literature, poetry or the visual
arts.

“I am very grateful that there are
people in this city who recognize
and appreciate artists,” McDermott
said. “I think that one of the best-
kept secrets of Pittsburgh is that it
has a very strong artist and writing
community,” she said. '

McDermott started writing in

- . . . . 4 . 4 p . -..-...-..-..-4-4‘,--v....-4---.-.--

high school and has had several
poems published in literary maga-
zines and anthologies. She is cur-
rently working on a manuscript.

She said that she would like to
use the grant money to travel to
Ireland and visit the birthplaces of
some of her favorite writers.

McDermott has taught at Pitt
since 1991. She received her mas-
ter’s degree in poetry from Pitt in
1994. But her interests _don’t lie
solely in the writing process.
McDermott said a big part of her
love of writing involves sharing her
knowledge with others.

“As a teacher I hope to encour-

age students to write,” she said.

McDermott credits Lynn
Emanuel, director of Pitt’s writing
program, as her inspiration.
Emanuel taught and worked with
McDermott during her years as a
graduate student at Pitt.

McDermott called Emanuel “a
wonderful poet and teacher.”

writing enthusiasts and equal-rights
activists of all ethnic backgrounds,
applauded Chen as even more sup-
porters arrived at the event. .
Kothari, who works at Pitt’s
Writing Center, read her poem, “If
You Are What You Eat, Then What
Am I?,” which focused on her
becoming an Indian in America. A
' Damian, a senior anthropology
major at Pitt, took the stage to
enthrall the audience with a unique
style of performance poetry. .
_“I wrote my poems on my hand
so I’d remember,” Damian joked.
He sported a black T-shirt and cargo
pants as he spoke in a rhythmic beat
about culture, society and Scantron
sheets that attempt to label him by
his race.
“-Do you really think there’s
only one.Asian channel? Do you

FROM PAGE 1

think we’re all thé same?” he asked

the audience. If the applause he gar-.
nered was any indication, Damian’s
memorized poems were well
received by the audience.

“Events like this make me real-

ize that I really do believe ‘in’

magic,” he said ‘before reciting his
last poem. Damian, who has only
been involved with poetry for four
months, was lauded as extraordi-
nary. > * ‘
“[Damian]' is a prodigy — he
really is,” Wei-Lee said. She is cur-

rently working with Damian to cre-

ate an organization that would pro-
mote culture, art and community
involvement while working to dis-
pel misconceptions or prejudices
against the Asian community. '

Damian’s performance was fol-
lowed by a number of other tran-
scultural, transgender, transracial
readings, including Naca’s poem
about doing Ecstasy on Gay Pride
Day at Disney World. >

More than 150 people attended
the event, but Wei-Lee said the
amount of money raised won’t cover
the costs associated with buying
Patel a modifiedvan.

“I think we’re going to have to
turn this into a statewide fund-rais-
er,” she said. “Sandip Patel could
have been any one of us.”

Metropol provided the venue

rent—free, and Sun Crumbs, a local if
'non-profit arts group, also spon-

sored the event. Sun Crumbs direc-
tors Christina Springer‘ and
Christiane Leach both donated their
salaries for the month of January to
support arts events such as the Patel
reading. i C

Sun Crumbs is currently accept-

ing donations toward purchasing a
modified van for Patel. Donations
can be sent by check to Sun
Crumbs,
Pittsburgh, Pa., 15212. , _
“Personally, in the wake of the
Baumhammers crime, I think people
have tried very hard to let us know
we are welcome in the Pittsburgh
community,” Wei-Lee said.

understanding of minority health,
problems,”
mately 90 participants at the con-
ference.
, Marin said that an increased
number of minority researchers
would have a positive impact on
the linguistic compatibility
between health care workers and
the community, and would pro-
mote better cultural understanding
and a long-termsinterest in. the
community. »
But not all participants in the
summit took a purely academic
View of the issue. Panelist Rashaad
Byrdsong called for a massive
social movement, similar to the

Marin told approxi—-

civil rights movement, to cure the
problems of the community. ,
“Social justice policy has been
ignored. We need a ‘universal
health care, plan for all whom are
not covered,” Byrdsong said. ‘
But other participants were not
so ‘positive. A participant who
wished to remain anonymous
alluded to a racist ‘society as" the
cause o_f inequalities in the indus-
try. ' .
“Racism is an economic com-
modity,” he said. “People make
money off of racism.”
’ ’ Most of the participants’ con-
tributions for future plans were
positive and upbeat. ‘
Panelist Patricia Theiss said,
“It is a lofty goal to eliminate dis-
parities, but we can at least start
addressing them.” '

semester in order to enter it in film
festivals.

Fifty potential actors arrived to
audition for the film’s 11 main
characters and assorted other small
speaking parts.

Men were required to read the
parts of Ned, the narrator of the
film described as normal but
unique, and Ramone, who is cast as
tall and attractive but shy and ner-
vous.

Women read the parts of Gina
and Marlene. Attractive Gina pos-
sesses a sharp wit. Marlene,
described in the character descrip-
tion as a “psycho bitch,” is certain

FROM PAGE 1

to be theifunniest character in the
film.

The actors received copies of
the dialogue when they arrived, and
while they waited in line, they
silently mumbled their parts. Some
separated themselves to pace and
practice, others simply read through
the lines. — ,

The actors’ experience varied as
well. Donovan said that he had
appeared in commercials and pro-
motions before.

He said he decided to audition
because he saw a ﬂier and thought,
“Why not?”

“It seemed like a fun thing to
do,” he said.

Standing next to him in ‘line,
Marie D"Alessandro, also a fresh-

man, clasped a copy of her head
shot.

She explained that in the past
she has gone to modeling school
and that she has had theater experi-
ence, but that she now wants to pur-
sue film.

Kuyler Irvis, a senior communi-
catioiis major, left his audition in a
positive mood. «

“It was fun,” he said. “It’s com-
edy, so I got to be more‘ like
myself.”

Irvis said that he has done many
mock auditions for his performance
classes and that he appeared as an
extra in the television movie, “The
Temptations,” which was filmed in
Pittsburgh.

Ashcroft’s extreme views

Happy New Year, everyone. A new
age has dawned in America; the millen-
nium is upon us. And our long, nation-
al nightmare has begun. ’

I hate to say “I told you so,” but
here we are on the cusp of four long
years of a Bush presidency, and already
things are looking bad for the majority

0 ' of the-population.

Dubya began appointing Cabinet

A members.

Many people do not pay much
attention to the U.S. Cabinet. It consists
of 12 departments devoted to matters of
national importance.

A Most recently, I am particularly

riled regarding the Department of’

Justice. Why? Because Dubya appoint-
ed John Ashcroft to_ the position of
attorney general, making him the head

‘of the Department of

Justice and the last word ABRINA' A

on law and order in

America. , g

 The attorney general is
the chief representative of
the United States in legal matters.‘ He or
she is the nat5ion’s‘top prosecutor, and
lords over 100,000 employees in the
Department of Justice. Occasionally,

the attorney general argues cases him-

self in front of the Supreme Court. _

So what’s wrong with Ashcroft
hosting this little judicial party? I’m
going to allow Attorney David Cole of
Georgetown University Law Center to
explain for me. Cole said, “No cabinet
position is more central to the issues of
equal justice for all than that of attor-
ney general. Yet John Ashcroft’s views
are so extreme that he is virtually cer-

tain not to provide equal justice for all.” .

‘ . You’re A probably wondering what
Ashcroft’s views are. Well, allow me to
start with his position on a woman’s
right to choose: He doesn’t think she
should have one. Ashcroft is strictly
opposed to any type of legal abortion.
In fact, he proposed an amendment to
the U.S. Constitution that would outlaw
abortion, even in cases of rape and
incest.

Not only does Ashcroft think a

'1 Woman should not have the right to ter-

minate an unwanted pregnancy, he

wants to curtail her ability to prevent an ,

unwanted pregnancy as well. Ashcroft
defines life as beginning at fertilization,
and would therefore invoke a ban on

the pill, as the pill occasionally pre-
. vents pregnancy by preventing a fertil-

ized egg from adhering to the lining of
a woman’s_uterus. _
That’s right. No abortion and no
birth control. Bear in mind that
Ashcroft : is the man who could con-
ceivably argue before the Supreme
Court regarding Roe vs. Wade, and is
the man who must ensure the safety of

SPIHER

S TA FF WR I TE R

don’t belongin the Cabinet

women entering abortion clinics.
It’s not just women who are afraid

of an Ashcroft appointment; civil liber—:

ties organizations are up in arms around
the country because of Ashcroft’s vehe-
mently anti—affir1native action stance

' and his crusade against Ronnie White,

a black Missouri Supreme Court judge.
President Clinton nominated White to
the federal bench, and Ashcroft, as a

senator, rallied Republicans to reject

White. Ashcroft excoriated him as
being “pro-criminal” and “the most
anti-death penalty‘ judge” on the
Missouri Supreme Court, even though
White had affirmed 41 of 59 death sen-
tences that came before the court.
Speaking _of the death penalty,

' Ashcroft just loves it, and has said pub-.

licly that he would not support a nation»
' 4» al rnorato_rium on the
penalty to allow an investi-
gation into the , glaring
socioeconomic and racial
‘bias of the application of
the V

  

America.

Nor does he support gun—control_~
laws, or strong antitrust laws. He‘
opposed Sen. John McCain’s tobacco;
regulation bill that would have penal!
ized tobacco companies for not deter-‘

ring teen smoking. But he supports

school prayer and sponsored a program ‘

in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act that
allowed states to use religious groups
to provide welfare services, a system

that to varying degrees- eliminates the
ability of the needy in America" to.
depend on their government for sup- "

port. Does anyone else rememberlthe
phrase “separation of church and
state?”

I could go on and on —— I haven’t
even mentioned Ashcroft’s opposition
to environmental laws. But my point is
this: 'President—elect Bush has chosen
Ashcroft to enforce the laws of
America, laws that the people need and
deserve for the sake of their own safety

and personal liberty. And yet Ashcroft

is vehemently opposed to many of
these laws. So I wonder —- can this
man be trusted to protect your rights,
even though he doesn’t think you
deserve them? '

If you’re like me, and you think he
cannot, please write to your senators
and tell them that their constituents.

0 don’t want Ashcroft enforcing his radi-

cal right-wing law in America. Because
now only the Senate can deny
‘Ashcroft’s confirmation and preserve
the sanctity of law in America.

Sabrina Spiher thinks that if a fertilized

egg counts as human life, every preg-

nant woman who voted for Al Gore.

should have her vote counted twice.

“Save the Last Dance”
Directed by Thomas Carter

tit

OLIVER B. JOHNSON HI

. Staff Writer

It is said that our generation has changed the scope of
movies, as directors move away from long shots and adopt
quick-moving cuts, like the ones we see in music videos. '

In that vein, “Save the Last Dance” is a two—hour music
video. And with this being the height of the Oscar season, it’s
nice to have a break from the slow-paced dramas that are
crowding the screens.

The premise of the movie leans heavily on the cliched
side of the spectrum — rr1iddle—class white girl from the
country is thrown into a city ghetto to live with her dad. She
meets a boy from the wrong side of the tracks and of differ-
ent ethnicity, and, of course, the romance begins. Throw into
the mix some hip—hop dance scenes and a tryout for Juilliard,
and you pretty much have an MTV version of ‘ ‘Next Friday,”
minus the dancing.

Although “Save the Last Dance” does play with racial
issues, it focuses much more on developing the main char-

movie seem less like a cliche and more like
a slice of life.

The ﬁrst day of school starts
off wiﬂr a bang for Sara when she
meets Derek Reynolds (Sean
Patrick Thomas), or as she refers
to him, “the asshole who thinks
he’s so cute and knows every-
thing.” Sara’s. armoyance toward
Derek quickly makes way for sparks of   V
romance when the two meet at a dance club called Stepz.

This is where the movie takes oif. Derek and Sara dis-
cover their shared passion for dance. “Save the Last Dance”
is a touching story with a great soundtrack, but it’s the acting
that resurrects this movie from the bowels of MTV-dorrr

Although the script doesn’t give Stiles a chance to show-
case her acting chops, it is clear that she is a wonderful actor
— she never makes Sara too over-the-top, which could eas-

' balance his plan of becoming a doctor with the pressures of

high school and an interracial relationship.

The dance scenes are done well and don’t immediately
point out Stiles’ lack of dancing ability.

“Save the Last Dance” is a fun, fast-paced dance mix,
with a great supporting "cast and enough variables to keep it
fresh. T

“Double Take”
Directed by George. Gallo

‘kit

CHRIS DINARDO
Staff Writer

The release of potential Oscar con-

tenders such as “Castaway” over the holi-

days has seemingly given movie studios
permissio’ri to'~s1ack,;blf  their January
releases. Nowhere is this more obvious than
in Touchstone Pictures.’  “Double
Take.”

For the past week, a speciﬁc 30-second
commercial for “Double Take” insists that
it’s by far the funniest of the movie of year.
At the end of this, though, the voice-over
admits that the year just started, but go see it
anyway. Seems like a unique marketing
strategy, right?

After sitting through the two hours of
“Double Take,” without so much as a
chuckle, I’m starting to think that the ad was
more like a confession.

CV61’!

     

-I So be warned —
Touchstone
Pictures is aware of the
low stakes of this cash
cow. 
“Double Take” centers
on clean—cut investment banker
Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones) who’s on the
run from the law when he is wrongfully
accused of killing his assistant, Shari
(Vrvica A. Fox). After trying to trade identi-
ties with low—life Freddy Tiffany (Eddie
Grifﬁn) and failing miserably, the two team
up to keep Daryl out of jail. From this point
the wackiness of a typical “buddy comedy”

ensues.
Like any ﬁlm of
this genre (from
“The . Odd
V Couple” to
“Lethal Weapon”)
the two characters
in “Double Take”
ﬁrst despise and
ridicule each
other, but eventu-
ally learn to trust
and appreciate
each other.
So what makes
this buddy come-
dy worth watch-
ing? Well not real-
ly anything, except
for the somewhat
~ ' unique twists and
‘T  tnmsoftheplot.

The title refers to the hidden identities
of most of the characters —— no one is who
he or she seems to be. Some CIA agents are
the bad guys and some bad guys turn out to
be the good guys, though this hall—of- ' -
rors approach never gets anywhere.

The problem is that director George
Gallo (‘Trapped in Paradise”) tries to pull

 

off this complex effect while still trying to
incorporate the simplicity of bathroom
humor and other overused gimmicks.

Looking past the fart jokes, the twist
and turns of “Double Take” just lead to a
dead end There are too many twists, and
none worth stretching your cortex around,
especially when you’re too distracted trying
to concentrate on Grifﬁn’s crude outbursts.

And there is nothing unique. Grii’f1n’s
character is comparable to his last character
in “Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo,” except
he yells at a dog in several scenes.

In one scene where Freddy is manhan-
dled by police officers, he shouts, “Let go of
me! I’m not Puﬁy!” Five years from now
some won’t get the joke, unless they
remember Puff Daddy’s run—in with the law
last year. _ _

Even by casting Jones, who is mostly
known as the “Make 7Up Yours” guy
seems like a box oﬂice ploy '— I guess no
NBA player was available for a screen test
at the time. Jones -is no amateur, but after
pulling off a likeable supporting role in the
football comedy “The Replacements,” he
barely gets by in “Double T .”

As reﬁeshing as 7Up might be, Jones’
addition to the ﬁlm and, in fact, the whole
ﬁlm itself, is nothing but stale ﬁzz.

Delicious Vinyl, Slimkid, Imani,

Fatlip and Booty Brown, they
changed their name and began
recording their debut album, Bizarre
Ride II: The Pharcyde. The album
went gold in 1992 from the help of
hits like “Ya Mama” and “Passing Me
By.”

_ The strength of that album won
The Pharcyde a spot on tour with De
La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest.
The tour went from the United States
to Europe and even Japan. The group
also opened up the second stage of
Lollapalooza for two straight years.

_In 1994, The Pharcyde released
their sophomore album
Labincabincalifornia. This album
was strong enough to keep the group
in the spotlight, partly because of a
video directed by Spike Jonze, who
directed such award-winning videos
as Fatboy Slim’s “Praise You.” The
single was called “Drop,” and the

, video depicted the group dancing and

singing backwards.

Plain Rap is The Pharcyde’s first
album since Labincabincalifornia.
This album is different because it’s
their first without Derrick “Fatlip”
Stewart. Along with providing lyrics,
Fatlip produced some songs as well.

Although the group is without
Fatlip, Plain Rap is a great new hip-
hop album. The beats are cool, the
vocals are real, and they shy away

from the self-propaganda that main-

stream hip-hop has become.

ERIC LIDJI

Senior Staff Writer

One of the film highlights of
2000 was playwright and screen-
writer Kenneth Lonergan’s (“Analyze
This”) directorial debut “You Can
Count on Me.” Staring Laura Linney,
Mark Ruffalo and Matthew
Broderick, it is an -endearing come-
dy/drama about the bond between
siblings with very honest, true-to-life
humor and very restrained and
mature dramatic scenes that never
slip into .sappy melodrama.

The film is set in the small town
of Scottsville, N.Y., which serves not
only as a plot device, but also adds a
homey emotive quality. That affec-
tive attribute was clearly tapped once
again in the making of the film’s
soundtrack. ,

This type of music, which is
becoming increasingly _more popular
with the rise of The Dixie Chicks, is

labeled country
rock. One of
the genre’s
rudimentary
figures is Steve
Earle, who sup-
plies five of the
12 tracks on
this album. The
tunes of this
musical catego-
ry are very
reminiscent of
“back porch
bands” and,
therefore,
easily lend
themselves
to the

theme of the
film:

Another country rock band, the
V-roys, supplied three songs, while
the bands Marah, 6 String Drag, Bap
Kennedy and solo artist Cheri Knight
fill out the record with one song
apiece. While these songs work,
none, with the exception of Cheri
Knight’s “White Lies,” which is a
wonderfully crafted two-step, have
the expertise evident in Earle’s'music
or are as impressive.

All of his songs keep along a sim-
ilar path, with simple but purposeful
lyrics, great guitar work and the use

of a variety of other
stringed instruments,
cowbells and steady but
not over—empowering beats.
Along with The Del McCoury Band,
he performs the songs “Texas Eagle,”
“Harlan Man” and “The Mountain.”
Earle and his band combine with Iris
DeMent on “I’m Still In Love With
You” and a band named Very Special
Guests (whose inventive name ‘gives
them free advertisement at virtually
every concert in history) on the song
“Pilgrim.”

But while Earle’s style -is consis-
tent throughout (in fact all of his
songs on this album come from his
1999 album The Mountain) the three

V-roys’ songs cover a wide spectrum
of music that not many bands have
shown the ability to do, although The
Rolling Stones tried. “Straight
Highway” keeps in tune with the
country rock theme, while “Strange”
employs the basic construct of coun-
try rock, but adds voice effects and
more emphasized drums. “Amy 88”
is as close to a pop song as anything
else on the album.

Collectively, all of the tracks
work and fit very well together,
resulting in an enjoyable, relaxing
and satisfying soundtrack that not
only sums up and steadily accommo-
dates the film, but also stands on its
own very nicely.

CHRIS DINARDO

FOR SOMETHING FUN  

 

Staff Writer

The “happy” in Happy 2B Hardcore
Chapter Five reminds me of a clown —
either you’re delighted by the hom-honk-
ing, thick-grinned funny guy, or you’d
rather throw him in a wood chipper.

Happy 2B Hardcore Chapter Five is
yet another compilation dedicated to the
sounds of 180-beats—per-minute electron-
Ica. -

Not familiar with the extremely fast-
paced style of techno? That’s because
“happy hardcore” has remained under-
ground since it first arrived in the United
States in the early ‘90s.. __
And with the latest
collection of
tracks dedicated
to the distinct
sound, not many
will appreciate it
either.

Distributed on ~
Moonshine Music, Happy 2B Hardcore
Chapter Five, along with past compila-
tions, is perfect for any rave connoisseur.

Think back to the first time you
engaged in a game of Pac—Man. One
hand tightly clutched the joystick, your
wrist was contorted in all directions

 
   
   
 

matching the movement of the yellow-
blobbed hero. “Whab_a—whaba”_ was the
only sound you heard. All your attention
was on the tiny screen, your eyes ﬁxed
on the numerous white pellets and the
four gold pellets until they were all gob-
bled up.

Keep rehashing this in your mind
while listening to any “happy hardcore”

A collection and you’ll understand the

essence of Chapter Five.

In the last Happy 2B Hardcore, most
of the tracks contained numerous Sarn-
ples of classical works from Beethoven

K and Mozart alongside continuous drum-

beats.

Moonshine calls this kind of techno
“break beat anthems,” though, with
Chapter Five, you get a soundtrack for
hyperactive cheerleaders. This is a com-
pilation of house and cheesy dance—c1ub-
inspired tunes. .

“Happy hardcore” disc jockey
Anabolic Frolic, who mixed all of the
past chapters, is at it again. This time
around he includes two original tracks,
“Feels So Right” and “Shelter Me.”

Other DJ s lend tracks on the compi-
lation with bliss-inspired titles that
include: “Music I Like” by
Fabulous Faber, “Sail
Away” by Bang! and

“Take It From The
Groove” by Midas.
The desired
.- affect of “happy hard-
core” is to make the lis-
tener feel, well, happy. But
Chapter Five works best when dancing
during the midnight hours at a local rave,
and not in a dorm room or moving car.
And just like with clowns, after listening
to the 15 tracks you’ll either feel like the
sunshine is shining on your head, or
you’ll be overwhelmed by a migraine.

The win was the Panthers’ first against a
ranked opponent since Nov. 23, 1999, against
No. 23 Miami. The Pirates were the highest
ranked team the Panthers have beaten since.’-a 
68-56 upset of No. 4 Kentucky on Nov. 27,
1998. -

Donatas Zavackas led the Panthers with 17
points and five assists. The sophomore used his
combination of size and ball-handling skills to
help spread Seton Hall’s defense.

He also helped hold the Pirates’ leading
scorer, Darius Lane, to just eight points.

“Zavackas was a very tough matchup,” said
Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker. “He can
make plays off the dribble.”

The Panthers finally put a complete game
together with a 77-65 win against No.-15 Seton
Hall on Saturday. ’ ’

Pitt opened up the second half on a 12-4 run

and never trailed. The Pirates cut the lead to four

points twice, but could get no closer. One .of the

times, Seton Hall hit two three-point plays in a
row to cut the lead to '49-45.

The Panthers responded with two shots from
behind the arc to extend the lead to 55-45.

This, plus the free potato chips the Pitt
dance team threw out to the crowd, got the 6,542
people in attendance into the game, andthe Pitt
players seemed to feed off the excitement.

“The atmosphere was great,” Howland said.
“The crowd was really behind us, ‘ and that
helps.”

Even with the dismissal of center Chris
Seabrooks, the Panthers out-rebounded the mus-
cular Pirates, 37-36. Freshman Toree Morris

Zavackas was a perfect seven of seven from
the free-throw line, hit two three-pointers and
handled the ball during a Seton Hall press. _

“I always have confidence in my shot,”
Zavackas said. “When I get [the ball], I’m wide

open..I can handle it.”

Gymnastics opens
with split in tri-meet  

BRAD CUPRIK
Assistant Sports Editor

Although the Panthers gymnastics
team opened with its -lowest score since Jan.
24, 1999, against West Virginia and ‘Brown
on Saturday, head coach Debbie Yohman
saw positives for her team to take with her.

The nationally—ranked Mountaineers
won the tn’-meet, recording 192.375 points.
WVU’s -score topped Pitt’s 188.9 and

T Brown’s 183.45.

“If we cut down on the falls, our score
will reﬂect how talented of a team we are,”
Yohman said. .

The Panthers had to count two falls on
the uneven bars, three falls on the balance
beam, and two deductions on ﬂoor routines.

Things started out well for the Panthers
on vault. Freshmen Diandra O’Connor and
Erika Goldberg impressed the audience
with a 9.65 and 9.50, respectively, while
sophomore Nathalie Sulpher picked up
where she left off last season, scoring a
9.625.

9 Sulpher averaged a A 9.687‘ score on
vault in 11 meets last season. ’ .

- Jennifer Easter contributed a 9.575 to
the team score, while senior Becky Doll,

who fought through shin splints and a stress .
_ fracture in the off—season, earned a 9.45

from the judges. ‘

The major rule change from last year in
NCAA gyrrmastics eliminated competitors
from getting two vaults and taking the high-
est score. The new rule allows just one vault
per gymnast. t t

“I think it made .a big impact on our
vaulters, because each vault counts now,”
Yohman said. “You don’t have one to thro
away.” . '

_ The Panthers were leading after the ﬁrst
rotation, as West Virginia scored a 47.525
on the ﬂoor exercise, while Brown had a
46.25 on the beam.

Pitt’s uneven bars team took a hit, when

the remainder
‘ Mountaineers scored a 48.525 on the vault,

it had to count falls from Sulpher and senior "
Colleen Crisi. Junior Raya Mullin had the a

team’s highest score on bars with a 9.75, fo1- _
lowed by - Rebecca ‘Singleton (9.65) and
sophomore Jamie Briner (9.575). ’

“We had some good bars routines, but
some sloppy dismounts brought our score
down,” Yohman said. .

West Virginia was able to overtake Pitt
for the ‘lead and did not relinquish it during 1
of the meet. The

topping Pitt by 1.2 points in the rotation.
The balance beam, which gave the

Panthers ﬁts last season, ‘was a menace in,

this year’s season opener as ‘well.
’ O’Connor stepped off the beam once

and Briner twice in Pitt’s ﬁrst two routines. 1

After Easter earned a 9.50, Crisi was penal-
ized for not staying on the beam. »

The Panthers still had a chance to post
a respectable beam score after Mullin
earned a 9.625, but Singleton had a diﬂicult
time staying on the beam for her routine and
finished with a 8.35.

" ‘We counted a few more falls on beam
than I would haveliked in a ﬁrst meet,”
Yohman said. '

The ﬂoor was not kind to two Pitt gym— _'

nasts, as sophomore walk-‘on Lisa Yarosh
competed for the ﬁrst time and had to put
her hand down after her ﬁrst pass. Crisi also
fell on a pass, and earned just a 9.0 from the
judges. .

“Those two mistakes can’t happen,”
Yohman said. “Lisa and Colleen were just a
little too anxious.”

WVU’s Amanda Halvonic and Dinorh
Boyd ran away with most of the top scores
in the meet, including a 1-2 ﬁnish in the all-
around. , p g . _

Halvonic narrowly edged Boyd for ﬁrst
place, 39.25—39.175.

Don’t ask me to pronounce Krzysztof

Penguins resort to goon hockey in acquiringMcKenna and Oliwa

The return of Mario Lemieux has
vaulted the Pittsburgh Penguins into
legitimate Stanley ‘Cup contenders,
but the moves made this weekend
may have cancelled those notions,
even when most people you talk to
will disagree.

In acquiring Kevin Stevens, Steve

McKenna and Krzysztof “buy a,

vowel” Oliwa for Roman Simicek,
John Slaney and Jiri Slegr over the
course of fourtrades, the Penguins
traded a young sniper and. two
mediocre defensemen for three goons.

‘Stevens. was one of the better
players in hockey during his first stint

with the Pens back in the late 1980s

and early 1990s, but since he left, he
has scored 40-some goals in eight sea-

H sons.

He was a fourth-liner at best for
the Philadelphia Flyers this season,
and had nine points in 23 games.

As some sort of a cult hero to
Lemieux, he was placed on the top
line with No. 66 and Jaromir Jagr in
yesterday’s game against the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim. I

I have to admit that it was nice to
see No. 25, but now I have a bad case
of deja boo-hoo. In Lemieux’s case, it

was wonderful, but now I’m having

As shown in yester-

That was a great strategy for the

Oliwa played for the defending

and Jan Hrdina, the Pens have some

scoring punch. Now they have a legit-
imate goon line.

 McKenna teamed up

Billy Tibbetts yesterday.
Tibbetts has spent some time
in prison for repeated sex
offenses, so if I’m Paul Kariya
and I see those three guys on
the ice, I’m telling the
coach ,my contact is

right.

That’s not hockey,
though.» The Penguins
ave become what most of
their fans hated and despised in

-the Flyers, New York Rangers and.

Washington Capitals —— a talented
team with two good lines and a bench
full of goons. '

Giving up Simicek can be consid-
ered a no-brainer, because even
though his future looks bright, the
Pens have enough speedy European
players.

Slaney was playing well in the

minor leagues with the Baby Pens this
season and was one of. Pittsburgh’s
better offensive blue-liners last year,
but he too was tradable.

The Slegr deal really makes no
sense. The Pens traded Slegr to the

draft choice, which they sent to
Columbus for Oliwa. Acquiring
Oliwa for Slegr doesn’t register quite
right.

Stevens and McKenna beefed up
the Penguins lineup, while the team
didn’t give up too much to get them.
Slegr, on the other hand, was a far too
steep price to pay for another goon.

Slegr scored key goals for the
Pens on defense last year and was
consistent in their own zone. I’m not
too sure that general manager Craig
Patrick and Lemieux will be patting
themselves on the back for that deal
when the season is through.

Patrick has made some‘ great
transactions in his time as GM, but
trading Slegr was not one of them.

For now, Pens fans can enjoy see-

ing Lemieux feast on opposing team’s'

defenses and then watching the new
“goon squad” just feast, period.

Brad Cuprik. is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News and wants to
know why Lemieux waited until Rob

’Brown was gone to make his come-

back.

Page throws the book at Seton Hall

KENNETH PAUL

Senior Staff Writer

Seton Hall brought one of the
best recruiting classes in the nation to
Fitzgerald Field House Saturday, but
it was Pitt’s star freshman, Julius
Page, who stole the spotlight.

Much of the hype in the Big East
this season surrounded the Pirates’
Eddie Griffin and his fellow fresh-
men Marcus Toney-E1 and Andre
Barrett, but Pitt’s defense was able to
contain Griffin and company, as the
Panthers went on to defeat the No. 15
Pirates, 77-65.

Page had the biggest game of his

young career, scoring 13 points on
five—of-eight shooting.It wasn’t the
number of points that he scored that
was so impressive, but when he
scored them. Page did most of his
damage in the last three minutes,
when he scored seven points to pre-
serve Pitt’s lead. V A

The Panthers, who have had trou-
ble shooting early in games, were
propelled to a 3-0 lead by a Page
three-pointer from the perimeter.

Page had the tough assignment of
guarding Seton Hall’s second leading
scorer, Darius Lane, who averaged
19.8 points a game coming into
Saturday’s contest.

Page stiﬂed Lane, who is known

for his ability to beat a team inside or
outside, keeping the star to just one
of four two—point shots. With some
help from teammate Donatas
Zavackas," Page held Lane to just
eight total points.

“You can’t contain him,” Page
said. “I just did my best to contend
every shot.”

After taking a 35-35 tie into half-
time, Pitt went on a 12-4 run, making
the score 47-39. Inbounding the ball,
Pitt guard Brandin Knight fed Page
along the baseline for a 14-foot field
goal.

A The Panthers led throughout most
of the second half until an Eddie

an 8-2 Seton Hall run. Another
Griffin shot over Isaac Hawkins in
the post cut Pitt’s lead to 63-59.

The next time down the court,
Page took a pass from Zavackas and

drained a jumper from the baseline. .

After the Page bucket, Barrett came
down the ﬂoor and hit a wide—open
shot from behind the are.

With the game at 65-62 in favor
of the Panthers, Page knocked down a
three-pointer, this time with Lane in
his face. The big shot brought the
sold-out crowd of 6,542 to their feet
and widened the margin to 68-62. '

“I always like him as a player.
He’s very explosive,” said Seton Hall
head coach Tommy Amaker. “He
seems to be a very tough kid, and he
stepped up today and made some big
shots.” ,4 ‘

Page’s ’ final three-pointer
increased Pitt’s lead to 75-65.

Page, from Buffalo, N.Y., had '

played against the Seton Hall fresh-

man trio before.
“I played against them before in

‘ the Eastern All—Star game, and I just

wanted to show them that I could be a
McDonald’s All—American, too,”
Page said.

Saturday’s game was Page’s seV— I
- A. enth consecutive start. He is averag-

ing 9.6 points a game.

Wittenmyer drops 30 on Mountaineers

THE PITT NEWS

Staff Writer,

When the Pitt women’s basketball
team played West Virginia at the
Fitzgerald Field House Saturday night,
the ' game was a homecoming for
Mountaineer freshman and Oakland’

I Catholic grad Kate Bulger.

The ‘Pittsburgh native helped her
team beat the Panthers earlier in the
season by scoring 22 points, and many .
friends and family members were in the

‘stands expecting to see her torch them .

again. .
‘Pitt sophomore ‘forward Mandy
Wittenmyer had other ideas.

 A ;.FROM PAGE 17

made one of two shots to make the ,
Panther deficit three. After a Pitt
timeout with 17 seconds to play, the
Panthers set up the play to give
Stewart the opportunity to tie the

game. -
‘ “I was just hoping it went in,”
Waites said. ‘‘All I can say is thank
you, Lord.” »
“The team played very, very
well and extremely hard,” Waites

, said. “Mandy was unbelievable, and

Brooke with the big three —- we
didn’t give up, andvwe had people
step up.” . . '-

One area Pitt focused on was
containing West Virginia’s Kate
Bulger, who burned the Panthers by
scoring 22 points in the last
matchup‘ between the teams. She
was held to 10 points, including just
two in the first half. _

“I love the challenge of another
good offensive player to make me a
better defensive player,” Stewart
said. I '
P Laine Selwyn also hit double
digits for the Panthers, finishing.
with 14* points and adding eight
assists’. '

. Bulger, the leading scorer for the
Mountaineers and a state champion
from her high school days, ended the
night with a below-average perfor-

mance, finishing with 10 points on just.
four.-of-13 shooting.

Wittenmyer ﬁnished at the opposite
end of the hardwood spectrum. She
scored a‘ career—high 30 points, hitting
10 of 16 from the field and 10 of 13
from the free—throw line. She also
pulled down a career-high 17 rebounds,
seven off the offensive glass. ’

“I didn’t even know it,” said.

Wittenmyer of her new bests. “During
the game, I don’t even pay attention to
stats.” “

tying Brooke Stewart three-pointer with

just seconds left in regulation, helped‘

the Panthers to a 75-67 win in overtime.
Wittenmyer owned the paint all
night, driving the lane for easy scores
and getting a lot of offensive second
chances for her team. »
“Mandy Wittenmyer, you see her
line,” said head coach Traci Waites,
hoarse from yelling during the game.

' “Unbelievable.”

Wittenmyer opened up the scoring
with the first four points of the game
and didn’t look back. From there, as the
team kept fighting off Mountaineer
comebacks, Wittenmyer was doing the

from underneath the basket. She had 12
of her 30 points by halftime.

She was there to ﬁnish what she
started, scoring six of the team’s 11
points in the deciding overtime period.

“Wittenmyer was her usual self,”
said West Virginia head coach Alexis
Basil.

“It’s about winning, not about
stats,” Wittenmyer said.

Wittenmyer pointed out that every-
one in a Pitt uniform came ready to
play, and it turned out that Bulger was-
n’t a threat at all. The game belonged to
Wittenmyer and the Panthers.

“We came out knowing we wanted
it," Wittemnyer said. “All of us came
out with intensity, not just me.”
