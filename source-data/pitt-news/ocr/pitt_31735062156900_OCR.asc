Cheer For Cape 'l‘oters

A large part of the credit for the success
of this year ’s student demonstration block goes
to Ben Grady and his student assistants, Bob
Schaub and Larry Burwin_kle. The three of

-them, working with students for the most part
unfamiliar with the demonstration technique,-

put across the system very effectively.

Much, of course, remains to be done if the
block is to approach maximum efﬁciency in
the working out of the varioiis letters and
designs. This, says Grady, will come with
‘time. The defects, and there were a few, of
this year ’s block were due not so much to lack
of cooperation by the students as to ‘lack of

, skill in manipulating the unwieldy cards. With

a little practice next year’s block should elim-
inate this drawback.

A vote of thanks, then, to Ben and his
helpers.Continue the improvement next year.

After Vets--What?

“G. I.’s Invade Cgmpuses . . . ” “Veterans
Swamp Nation’s Colleges . . . ” Makes good
reading, doesn’t it? Not the “swamp” part,
but the idea that " thousands of fellows, and

girls, are getting a chance at an education to-.

day that yesterday was just a pipe dream.
The end, however, _is in sight. Most of the

«veterans who are going to school are there
now; in three or four years colleges will have '

reverted to their peacetime role with every-
thing that role connotes.‘ From certain ‘angles
it isn’t a pleasant thing to contemplate. It
means that many persons will again be de-
nied, as many still are today, a chance at a
college education. It means that to the extent

. of that denial the individual communities and

the country as a whole will lose in many Ways.

They will lose particularlylin the realm of

' competent leadership, leadership that might

 
    

have been forthcoming had deserving students
been given an opportunity to learn and to

.,.-‘develop their abilities through a college edu-
'—-cation. ’

Certainly,‘-many civic groups and private
organizattions will continue to give scholarships
to high school students of exceptional ability.
Even these scholarships, however, are often
hedged about. with complicating restrictions
and regulations. Sure, there ’l1 still be some en-
terprising-boys and girls who will work their
way through college. Not many, though, and
they’ll lose something in the process. College
will again be largely schools for the “Well-

_oE.” _ '

Not everyone should go to college, because
not everyone is able to beneﬁt that kind of
education, but those who can should be given
the opportunity to do so if our society is to
continue to progress.

V ,Why not, then, federal scholarships for the
deserving who are ﬁnancially unable to aﬁord
a college education? In the past the word ‘‘fed-

'  eral” was viewed with horror when coupled

with education. This need not be so today.

By its administration of the G.I. educational
program the government has shown that it is
possible to subsidize individuals without im-
posing upon’the colleges any restrictions as to

~ what should be taught or how. With the re-

moval of the regulation feature there is no
reason why colleges and universities themselves
should not get behind such a plan.

A federal scholarship program modeled
after the G.I. educational beneﬁts is an invest-
ment in progress.

The ew Look

One of the more telling blows to the “new
look” was dealt by a cartoonist at the Univer-
sity of Syracuse. One" male observed loudly
to another as a long.-skirted co-ed passed,

Editor’s Note: The following article is the first of a series of
articles dealing with the problem of faculty rating. It is printed here
with the hope that readers will realize that such a plan is workable
and is advantageous to the University as a whole. ‘
ANN ARBOR, Mich.-——IP——Student ratings of their instruc-
tors and courses will be part of anew and inclusive planfor

evaluation of faculty services recently adopted by the faculty
of the University of Michigan Qollege of Literature,_Science

and the Arts.

Expected to go into effect on an experimental basis» dur-

ing the current academic year, the:

plan also calls for judgment of-

faculty services by faculty com-
mittees from each teaching de-
partment. Resultsiof such evalua-
tions of teaching, research, ad-_
ministration and public service are
to be available to the faculty mem-
bers themselves and also to uni-
versity personnel oﬁicers. L
. “Successful teaching is to be re-
garded as a primary factor in the
new evalution system," a report
by the Committee on'Co11ege Prob-
lems points out. “It is the ﬁrst
obligation of an educational insti_
tution to provide good teaching
and encourage proper advisory re-
lationships between a teacher and
his students.” '
Students will be asked to grade
their instructors according to a
printed form distributed in the
classroom at the end of the semes-
ter. These rating. forms ask the
student to check the quality of
instruction under such ‘headings
as “clarity of assignments, pre-
sentation of subject matter, suc-
cess in keeping students alert in
class, availability for consultation
with students.” Each student will
also be asked to rate the course,
regardless of the quality of in-
struction. ,
Students will ﬁll out these rat-
ing forms anonymously. The in-

Senior Opines
‘If I Were
Frosh Again‘

NORMAN, Okla. —- ACP -
“Here’s what I would do if I were
a freshman again,” says a senior
columnist. “First, I'd never over-
load on hours. I’d resist that urge
to go through _ the University’s
Sears and Roebuck catalogue and
add an extra hour or two just for
good measure. I’d take it easier
even if it meant another semester.

“Secondly, I’d not buck for A’s.
An A is a great reward but “when
you’re going all out for an A and
you sack a B, you’re lower than
the Oklahoma Aggies on a Wil-
liamson rating.

“That doesn’t mean that I’d en-
roll only in snap courses. or shoot
paper wads in class instead of pay-

‘ ing -attention-‘-—it just means that

you can get what the professor’:
paid to put across without having
a 3-point grade average.

“Thirdly, I’d look around at all
the time-sapping organizations on
the campus before putting in my
bid for membership. Then I’d join
"few enough that I could be of serv-
ice to them and they could be of
service to me. , _,

“And lastly, I'd call time out
every so often and realize that
these are the greatest years of my
life. I'd try to recognize that this
is the time of my life, to which I’d
forever. after refer nostalgically, as
“the good olddays.”

“I’d make myself realize that
all the colorful, ‘exciting life
didn’t exist, as the movies make
believe, in the gay 90’s or the roar-
ing 20’s or in any other historical
past . « . but rather that NOW

should be proud.“ All words and music were _ 

written by Pitt students and -have been or-
chestrated by Max Adkins, an honorary mem-

. ber of the Graduate Cap and Gown Club.

Tonight the curtain will again’ rise with the
opening number “On Your Toes.” Written
by the co-authors of-“‘Mabel’s Fable,” Will
Hansen and Ken Phifer, it is a peppy jump
tune which sets the spirit of the show.

Another Hansen and.Phife'r tune, “Sailor
Boy,” is very livelyvwith lyrics satirizi-ng navy
life. While the chorus sings, whistles and hums,
members Of the dancing chorus go into a
sailor pantomine dance routine. ‘

“Tomorrow’s Love” and “My Heart Won’t
Say,” written by Will Hansen, hire the hit

.ballads of the production. They are. original,

smooth dance pieces and are highlighted in
many big production numbers played in var-
ious tempos. _

The most outstanding ‘novelty number is
performed by Mrs. Rockwell (Murray Harris)

as she tells the audience “I Love To Ride A"

Boat.’-’. This song, ad-libed magniﬁcently by

Mrs. Rockwell, is a play on words-——very sug- ‘

gestive ' words.

“You’re The One For. Me,” written by
Ken Phifer i-s a patter comedy tune as is “I

Constitution

§
A constitution for the Inde-
pendents was, whipped into -shape
this -week by the 20 members of
the organization’s steering com-
mittee. The draft will be submit-
ted to the 236 Independent mem-
bers for modiﬁcation and approv-
al today. ‘
Also, a name for the new or-
ganization, the “Pitt Independent

Association,” has been chosen by

the steering committee and will
be put to a membership vote to-
day. This name was adopted by
the committee over the objection
of some of its members who fear-
ed that “lndependent” has an
anti-frat connotation.

Proposed in the tentative draft
of the constitution are the follow-
ing purposes: sponsor social func-
tions, promote sch-ool spirit, pro-
vide a medium for expression of
student opinion, create an atmos-
phere of friendliness among stu-
dents and enable them to get ac-
quainted, cooperate with other or-
ganizations in the University in
achieving the‘ above aims, and
accept as members any students
of the University not belonging to

fraternities or sororities.

The proposed constitution is a
conglomeration of features gath-
ered from Pitt's old Independent
constitution, the constitution of
Carnegie Tech’s Independents,
chairman Harry Pluebell’s recom-
mendations, and the recommenda-

. tions and ﬁndings of the several

-investigative sub-committees of

the steering committee.

Spring Registration
Ultimate in Simplicity

Gradually the registration crush at the beginning of each semester

is being simpliﬁed.

According to a rel-ease from University Registrar John G. Quick,
the registration for the coming spring semester will be reduced to
a mere matter of ﬁlling out two cards. In semesters past, students
have been spending up to two full days ensnared in the red-tape of

signing up for classes.

Service to

Handle

All Items but Books

A free check room designed to hold a capacity of 800 wraps and
200 smaller articles will be available for students and faculty mem-

bers beginning Monday, Dec. 8.

The check room will be open from 8 a. m. to 10 p. m. on week
days and from 8:30 a. m. until 1:30 p. m. 0-n Saturdays. It will be
located in the locker room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral be-
tween the Red Tuck Shop and the elevators, on the right hand side.

This new system, the ultimatee

in streamlining, provides for ear-
ly distribution of class schedules,
registration and class cards. These
are to be ﬁlled out before the
time of mid-year registration.

Class cards will be given out
by instructors Wednesday and
Thursday, Dec. 10 and 11 to stu-
dents continuing in the second
semester of fall classes. Students
requiring schedule adjustments or
who desire to enroll in non-con-
tinuation classes will be able to
do so at departmental ofﬁces Mon-
day and Tuesday, Dec. 15 and 16.

Grade reports will be given out
at the time of ﬁnal registration.
After ﬁlling out two other cards
and paying tuition‘ and fees, the
registration will be completed. De-
tailed instructions will be given
on the pre-registration ‘ forms
which are being mailed early this
month.

Tonight's Snow Ball

Busy Congress Acts V

On Many

Pass on NSA,
Special Election

Student Congress decisions have
scratched two more problems off
its agenda.

The proportional representation
amendment is to be voted on Jan.
7, 1948, and Mary Lou Megaffin
and Chuck Davis will be the
delegates to the NSA regional con-
ference at Pennsylvania State Col-
lege Dec. 19 to 21.

For the amendment election,
the Schenley Room will serve for
Cathedral students and State Hall
for the engineers as polls.

In connection with NSA, the

two members are only delegates

and are not representing the
University as part of that organ-
ization. Their report, however,
will be considered by Congress in
any future decisions concerning

‘NSA. '

George Lynn, Congress presi-
dent, said that elections in the
past show that extraordinary pre-
cautions need be taken to prevent
some students from voting more
than once.

Ellsworth Center was not as-
signed a polling place for the ref-
erendum. They are drawing up a
student constitution of their own
according to Donald Murray, rep-
resentative in Congress from the
Center.

Of possible major importance in
the future, was a plan submitted by
Paul Steinlauf to Congress and
then referred to Bob Dickey’s so-
cial committee for study. It sug-
gests an assessment of $2 from
students at registration time
which could be used to sponsor as
many as 10/dances with big name
bands per year.

Questions

Free Tickets
Voted Down

By Leonard Lewis

Among Student Congress’s
resolutions in another busy
Tuesday session was: “That no
complimentary tickets be grant-
ed by any dance committee for
any undergraduate social func-
tions of the University.”

It was noted that Congress did
not mean this to exclude guests
of the committee, oiﬁcial planners
of the dance, student workers who

‘are needed at the dance, and peo-

ple serving in an oiﬁcial capacity
for some school activity, especitl-
ly from publications.

The resolution was passed after
listenin-g to Bob Dickey’s report
on the attitude of his social com-
mittee towards the issuance of
complimentary tickets.

He said that the members of
the committee agreed that it was
an unfair strain on the ﬁnances
of the organizations sponsoring
dances to issue complimentary
tickets. ‘

Discussion boiled down and
centered around goodwill tickets
issued to The News. The consen-
sus of opinion was that this set-up
was unpleasant and uzffortunate.

University evening classes start-
ed in 1796 when Joseph Andrews
taught in the old Pittsburgh Ac-
ademy at Third and Cherry streets.
Tuition was three pounds a year
for reading, ﬁve pounds for math-
ematics, and six pounds for lan-
guages. Students brought their
own paper and quills for their

in charge of the locker’ room
states that‘ the smaller articles
will consist of packages, brief-
cases, etc. but deﬁnitely no books.

signed to work during the sched-
uled hours, and student assistants

Barbara Ann English is a lucky
girl this_ month. She has been
named a “Pitt Pantherette” -as the
result of a new Panther publicity
scheme.

Latest communiques from the
Panther inner office say that twice
a month the staff will choose a
Pitt coed who they believe pos-
sesses the qualities of an ideal
college s-weetheart. Upon this girl
will be bestowed the title of “Pitt
Pantherette.”

. The lucky lady will also be
placed on the Panther fashion list
and receive a free Panther sub-

scription. Her picture will be dis-
played poster fashion on the bul-
letin boards of the various Uni-
versity buildings.

As many students have already
seen, Barbara, the first winner of
this award, is lovely and petite.
.She is a member of Alpha Delta
Pi and Kappa Phi sororities.

During the war, she w-ork-ed as
a spot welder for Republic Steel‘
in Youngstown, Ohio. Since then
she has worked as a clerk in a
department store and as a travel-
ing saleslady.

Her popularity and attractive-
ness, however, have presented the
Panther oﬁice with a problem. It
seems that Barbara’s pictures are
so much in demand that students
have been taking them off the
bulletin boards. Inasmuch as post-
ers are expensive to reproduce,
the Panther has announced that
such larceny will not be tolerated.

As a result, the magazine is of-
fering a $5 reward for evidence
leading to the identiﬁcation of
any unauthorized individual seen
tampering with the Pitt Panther-
ette posters. —

For Veterans

Fraternity men, 150 strong, will
report to the Blood Bank Thurs-
day afternoon, Dec. 11, to give
1.50 pints of blood for the Veter-
ans’ Hospital in Aspinwall.

The move was decided upon at"

the bank. Mrs. Neuenschwanzder

explained that since there are,

three 0’ Thursday holidays occur-
ring in November and,December.
and that Thursday afternoon is
the only time the Blood_ Bank is

_open, there would be a serious

lack in the blood supply it addi-
tional pints’ weren’t donated.

  Stuiclying Aubroacl

 May Collect Twice

World War II veterans deciding to study overseas may be able
to qualify for beneﬁts under the Fulbright Act and the GI Bill at
the same time, Veterans Administration ruled today.

The ruling held that payment of education and training beneﬁts

under ‘the GI Bill may be made

to student veterans regardless of

any grants made them under the Fulbright Act by the Department
of State since funds for the Fulbright Act were not secured from

United States Government appro-9

priations. ,

As a result, World War II vet-
erans qualifying for foreign study
under both lawsmay receive bene-
ﬁts allowed them under the Ful-
bright Act as supplemental to the
benefits provided them by the GI
Bill, VA said.

Foreign Study Aproved

Under the Servicemen’s Read-
justment Act (GI Bill), World War
II veterans may study in a VA ap-
proved foreign educational insti-
tution under the same provisions
that apply to study in a College or
university in the United States.

VA will pay customary tuition
charges and fees, provide the
books and equipment needed to
complete the course satisfactorily,
and pay monthly subsistence al-

 . lowances of $65 to veterans with-

out dependents or $90 to veterans
with dependents. '
The veterans must arrange for
their own passports, visas, trans-
portation overseas, and admission
to the institution they select.
The ‘Fulbright Act’ provides for

' grants in aid to American students
for -study abroad or to foreign‘

students for study in this ~ coun-
try. It authorizes the Department
of State to enter into agreements
with foreign governments to use
foreign currencies and credits, ac-
quired through the sale of sur-
plus property’ abroad, to defray
the costs of the program.

- Financial Aid Permitted
, Financial aid rmay be provided
for United States citizens study-
ing in schools of foreign countries
in which credit is acquired. This
assistance may include payment
with foreign currencies. for trans-
portation, tuition, _ maintenance
and other expenses incidental to
scholastic activity. Citizens of par-
ticipating foreign countries may

receive travel grants to the Unit-

ed States for study.
The Fulbright Act also provides

‘ that veterans of World War I and

II be givenpreference by the 10-
man Board of Foreign Scholarsihps
which awards the study grants.

It is hoped that a limited num-
ber of grants will be made under
the Fulbright Act for the aca-

, demic year 1948-49. Applications .

are not being received at this time,
but persons desiring information
on -the program may obtain it from

For Dr. H. C. Carlson it’s always spring. Pitt’s veteran cage coach

is facing his twenty-seventh year

of basketball with the same con-

ﬁdent outlook with which he began his ﬁrst.
No matter how black things look nor how uncertain the future,

a little sunshine is just what the

Doctor orders. A Pitt basketball

team is never beaten until the ﬁnal whistle.

Doc believes that a team that

won’t be beaten, can’t be beaten

and he tried to install this spirit¢

in his players. This accounts for
his antics and gyrations about the
ﬂoor. _

The Panther hoopsters might

This year, the Pitts will be
keeping in spirit with their pre-
decessors. They begin on the 12th
with a mid-Western tour and then
spend the Christmas holidays in
the South.

This season will mark the 20th
anniversary since a—Carlson team
completed an unbeaten season.
The ’27-’28 squad hung up an im-
pressive record of no losses
against 21 wins. The first and last
time a college eleven accomplish-
ed this against major opposition.

When. Carlson was told that
this might be a good year to re-
peat that, he said, “Well we play
Wisconsin on the 12th, they won
the Big Nine last year. The next
night we meet Illinois and then
Purdue. They were second and
third.”

“Hell, we’ll Whip ‘em all. They
can only put ﬁve men on the
ﬂoor at a time.”

After upsetting the powerful
Resistance Block before the holi-
day, the Dynamos were beaten de-
cisively by a consistent Local team,
33-0, in the semi-ﬁnals of the IM

The winners scored early in the
first period. Following a series of
passes by Bob Brubaker, the L0-
cals reached the ten. Brubaker
then shot a pass in the end zone
which “Jocko” Ruth pulled in for
the initial TD. Then, the Locals
rolled for four‘ more scores.

Nearly 50 students interested in

istered at Room 201, Ellsworth

The lone development is that

“not interested.”

To Gain Roughhouse 6-6 Tie

By Donald Giﬁin

It was touch football the Locals and Pi Kappa Alpha played
Tuesday afternoon, but the boys tabbed hard, very hard. The
game, played to determine Pitt’s IM champions, ended in a

6-6 tie. .

_ The replayoff winner meets Carnegie Tech’s. representa-
tive this afternoon at 3:30 o’clock,in Tech Bowl for the,inter-

 

collegiate IM championship.

    

Local End, BillCam _(17), tries to get. around PiKA defend-er,

Joe Ingelido, in the waning moments of the IM playoff game Tues-
day. Ingelido got him. Notice the pigskin, seemingly hanging from
Camp's arm. Another PiKA player sprawls ‘after diving vainly at the
ball-toter. The game ended in a 6-6 d-eadlock.

Athletic Equipment Manager
Was Friendly ’ro Everybody ‘

John E. Scott, for 17 years in
charge of the equipment room at
Trees’ Gym, died Nov. 25. “Scot-
ty” was well known to the thous-
ands of Pitt men who made the
long climb up the hill.

There was nothing formal or
cold about the,74-year-old equip-
ment man. He made friends readi-
ly and it ‘was said of him that he
was never known to say a harsh
word to anyone.

News of his death came as a
shock to the men “with whom he
was associated up on the hill.
“Scotty was a great guy,” said
Frank Carver, Pitt publicity di-
rect-or. “I never saw a harder
worker.”

Long after quitting time he
could often be seen working in
his equipment room.'.The equip-
ment room was his castle and the
place is now empty without its
king.

Scott had been at Trees Gym
longer than any of its present oc-
cupants. There, he handled gym
-clothes, baskets, athletic equip-
ment, and student’s valuables.

Ralph Mitterling, physical edu-
cation‘ instructor and Baseball
coach said of Scotty, “He was ab-
solutely and unquestioningly
trustworthy and always a gentle-
man.” K

/His friends tell how he used to
walk from his home in Troy Hill
to the Trees Gym ‘in the morning.

They kidded him in his later years

when age caught up with him" and
he had to start riding the street-
car to work.

They can’t understand though
how anyone will be able to‘ re-
place him. It’s hard to ﬁnd a man

wh-o would handle his job with
equal perseverance, courteousness,
and friendliness.

‘9 The Local adopted the Chicago

Bears brand of ball for the con-
test. PiKA, egged on by their big
cheering section, roughed it up
themselves several times.
Officials Keep Quiet

Refereeingl hit a low point, the
four oﬂicials employing a hands-
off policy on penalties. Many ob-
vious fouls raised a hubbub among
the fans but no Whistles were
blown.

Bill Ward imitated his broth-

er, Lee, Pitt varsity center, makq,

ing a beautiful, but illegal, shoe-
string tackle on a PiKA run.

The Locals, pepped up for a
victory, scored on the opening
kickoff. Bob Wicks grabbed PiKA
Don Wilde’s boot on his own 20-
yard line and raced through the
entire Maroon team for the score.

Wicks pass attempt for the extra

point was blocked.
Daugherty Scores TD

. Frank Daugherty tallied the ty- i

ing TD in the second period. The
PiKA’s moved downﬁeld on Ken
Cochran’s passes to the 22-yard
line. Then, ﬁnding his receivers,
covered, Daugherty raced around
left end into the corner of the
end zone.

On the point try, the PiKA’s
completed a toss, but the receiver
was stopped before he could cross
the goal line.

In the second half, both teams
threatened often. Brilliant inter-
ceptions, a one-handed stab by
Wicks the best, staved off the
drives. _ '

Players Banged Up

Daugherty got a stray knee in
his stomach in the third quarter,
the worst injurycf a fray, in
which one or two players were
sprawled on the ground on every
play. *

With the bruises they all suffer-
ed, the playoff of the playoff
should be set back for a while to
allow the bruises to heal. Sev-

eral of the players hobbled
through Cathedral halls ‘Wednes-
day. ‘

   agan Asks 
To Be ‘Winners’

}\,

 

Pit:t’s 1947 football team tossed this season’s record out

the Faculty Club window and began preparing for 1948.

‘ The occasion was the second annual football banquet spon-
sored by the Faculty Committee on Athletics. An all male audi-
ence of more than 140 listened while six speakers e1ther,,re-

‘viewed the ’47 season or called for greater effort next year.

After Dr. Richard E. Sherrill, chairman of the Faculty
Committee, spoke about the educational value of football,'Ath-

letic Director James Hagan de
livered the keynote address.

He asked the team to “forget"
about the past and get_ready for

the 1948 season. Everybody,” he
urged, “must make up their minds
that we are going to be winners,
and we must prepare with con-
ﬁdence, courage, and determina-
tion.”
Squad Has Ability

“Maybe we won’t be entirely
successful, but we never will if
we don’t try. There is some ﬁne
football ability there,” he em-
phasized. . V
. Hagan thanked everyone for be-
ing “decent and considerate” dur-
ing a very difficult campaign. And
he praised the squad as “one o-f
’the finest group of boys” he has
ever known. -

Bernie Barkouskie, hustling left
guard who represented the team
at the Speaker’s table, assured
everyone “.we._will try to do bet-
ter in the future.” ‘

Coach Mike Milligan brieﬂy re-
viewed the ’47 season. After com-

Thrash Sonny
Boys. 67-39

The Panther basketball’ squad
will have to be reckoned with
this season.

At least the Sonny Boys, an in-
dependent team who last week
dropped a 57-23 game to Du-
quesne University, felt the Pitt
cagers will be powerful this sea-
son. The reason — a stunning
67-39 defeat handed them in,a
practice session Tuesday.

Although the game was not an
oﬁi-cial encounter, Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, used two teams alternately.
They showed a concentrated at-
tack which swept to a ﬁrst quar-

' ter margin of 25-5.

The Sonny B-oys found the
range in the secondtstanza against
the second stringers to make it
32-16. But the Panthers roared
back in the third and ﬁnal periods
to increase their‘ score and ﬁnish
with a 28-point margin.

Evenness ‘in scoring was the
deciding factor that gave Pitt the
win. Dodo Canterna, Mort Lerner

and Sammy David led the first

team with nine points apiece
while George M.cCrossin topped

the seconds with ten.

""Thci‘c a1'e"as many .studen.ts at Pitt as there are in the whole

of Belgium."

That vsas the tlr;-'t ll11}3l'e.%Slt>ll Pitt gave Bel.giL1m—bom Andre
L. Mechelynclr, attending classes at the University und(‘~.r the Rotary

fellowship for advanced study.

Andre is spending one year at Pitt in order to get his master
of science degree in metal‘lurgical engineering. In his spzzrcytime he

speaks on Belgium in various
cities. under the auspices of the
Pittsburgh Rotary club.

One of the things that impress-
es Andre about Pitt is the great
number of students who have
"cars. “It’s wonderful,” he grins.
“Everyone seems to have a car.”

Andre, who has no auto, has
considerable trouble understand-
ing the system of riding street-
cars. “You give them a nickel or
a dime, they give you a little piece
oi‘ paper, and then you ride ev-
erywhere,” he exclaims in con.-

ifused amusement.

Andre thinks that classes at
Pitt are just as crowded as they
are in Belgium universities, but
he is still lonely. Recently, how-
ever, he was able to relieve this
loneliness when he met h Bel-
gian barber in Wilkins'bLtI‘g who
regaled him with a long conver-
sation in French.-

Andre can speak French fluent-
ly and German slightly. He .is al-
so expert in English, since he
studied it "for six years in a Bel-
gian high school.

He attended classes at the Uni-
versity of Brussels from July, 1941
until the school was closed by
military occupation. Later he con-
tinued his studies at the Univer-
sity of Liege, leaving in 1944 to
join the Belgian army. As an en-
gineer he saw action in Holland
and‘ Germany.

After being discharged from
the army, he returned to the Uni-
versity of Brussels and worked
for a degree in mechanical and
electrical engineering. At the re-
quest of the Paris Polytechnical
school he toured Alsace and the
Saar region for advanced study,
and in June was awarded the
Paul Harris fellowship from the
Rotary foundation.

Andre’s studies here began. last
September in a confusion of pa-
pers, cards, and schedules, to
which his major reaction was “It
must be a wonderful system.” If
he holds up under the systenmhe
will complete his fellowship next
September and leave Pitt with a
master’s degree in metallurgical
engineering.
