‘Vol. 66, No. 3

September 10, 1971 

Rally Lures 30,000   Students

Mayor John Lindsay of
New York, now a Democrat
urged college students to -em-
pathize with the American
workingman, who, according
to,Lindsay, “is really in a
kind of indentured servitude.”

Lindsay, addressing yester-

- day’s Voter Registration Rally

at Point State~Park, exhorted
students to consider the plight
of workers, “who are neither
black',nor poor but who are also
terribly pressured."

Painting a grim portrait of
the worker’s life, Lindsay noted
that the /real pay of the work-
ingman has declined almost one
dollar per week over the past
five years. He also conjured
an image of tedious factory
“And if the worker
mill,” Lindsay‘ lamented, “he
loses his pension.”

While he urges students to
help build a broad national co-
alition to “turn this country
around,” Lindsay admitted the
task was difficult. “I don’tvknow
of any more frustrating way to
change than through the peace-
ful democratic process. It tzgilces
time, patience, humor, faith,
and an understanding about the
human condition.-"

Lindsay concluded, however,
that "without hard, demanding
work, we cannot succeed.”

McClosky Pleads for Help ‘

Expounding a similar theme,
Congressman Pete McClosky
(R-Calif.) contended that "the
White House is on the apathy of
young people.” McClosky, who
will oppose President Nixon in
next'year’s primaries, urged stu-
dents to assist him in his bid for
"the Presidency, and openly con-
fessed, “I need your help."

McClosky hastened to add
that an A impressive McClosky
showing against—Nixon in the
spring primaries could help con-
vince the President to end the
Vietnam" War before next sum-
mer. He also argued that if an
impressive. number of students
register Republican, the Presi-
dent might anticipate strong
dovish sentiment in the primaries
andfnight end the war sooner.

McClosky, a vigorous oppon-
ent of the War, rebuked those
students who protest against the
war without helping elect doves
to national office.

But he bestowed accolades on
the students present, their "love
and‘ kindness” and urging them
to “take on their elders" armed
with such virtues.

.McClosky. an announced Pre-
sidential hopeful, lent an aura of
prestige to the Registration Rally,
as did Mayor Lindsay.

Lindsay, who switched parties
last month, has not yet decided

, -whether to run for President next
_year. —

Approximately 3,000 students

registered to vote at the Regis—'
ter for Peace and New Priorities -

Rally yesterday evening in Point
State Park. '

Peter Yarrow of “Peter, Paul,
and Mary” and John Kay of
“Steppenwolf” entertained the
30,000-35,000 young people who
attended the rally, the largest
thus far in the nation. The
three hour session,
was more than a miniature rock
festival.

Allard Lowenstein, a former
Democratic Congressman and
organizer of the rallies nation-
wide, emphasized that the pur-
pose of the gathering was not to
"dump Nixon."

SA-Allocations Feud
Halts Budget Reviews

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor
A power struggle between

members of the Student Alloca-
tions Committee and the Stu-

dent Associations -Social Com-

mission has left the funding
process for student organizations
in abeyance. V ~

The Allocations Committee,
which reviews budgetry requests
has refused. to meet with the
Social Commission, composed of
the_four SA commissioners and

six members to finish budget"

funding until both sides sit down
to discuss the entire process of
reviewing and recalling student
budgets.

The,Allocations Committee has
charged that there is no effective
"system of checks and balances"
to insure “responsible behavior"
by the Social Commission.

It has also accused the Com-
missioners of ignoring the Con-
stitutional process for making
bylaws and of proceeding inef-
ficiently at meetings.

In a statement to the student
body Wednesday, the ‘members
of the Committee—John Dorsey,
Mary Goessler, John Kolb, Mike
Poremba, and Bob Schmeider
said. “The Allocations’ Commit-
tee does not wish to submit it-
self to the uncontrolled meeting
with the Student Commissioners
until such time when definite
procedures, responsible behavior,
and a more ,diplomatic attitude
are sustained in such a meet-
ing.”

Their actions leave several
organizations, including the
Pitt News and the Committees
Commission, which have large
budget. requests, without student
funds.

One of the specific complaints
of the Allocations’ Committee
focuses on a recent action that
gives Social Commissioner Lenny
Klovanic nearly unlimited power
in spending his $75,000_allocation. .

At a joint meeting of the A110-
cations Committee and the So-
cial Commission, the rule that
requires an organization to spend
its -money according to its ap-
proved budget was waivedfor
Klavonic. He is required only
to submit bi-weekly budgets to
his fellow commissioners to give
him flexibility in arranging
concerts.

“There’s no check on the $75-
000.” Schmeider complained.

“They (the four commission-
ers) didn’t go through the sys-
tem—they just railroaded it
through,” Kolb charged.

According to the Constitution,
the Allocations Committee recom-
mends to the Social Commis-
sion the amount an organization
should be funded after reviewing
its budget. If it disapproves,
of the recommendation, the So-
cial Commission can then return
the budget to the Allocations
Committee for further review.

If still dissatisfied, the Social
Commission can override the
recommendation by a vote of
three of four commissioners. or,
if the budget questioned is one
of the four commissioners’ it
must be approved by a unani-
mous vote of the four.

“Their (the commissioners’)
opinion is that we are totally

subordinate to them,” Kalb ar-
gued. “And if that's true, There
are no checks and balances at
all.”

gether committed to the convic-
tion that whether it is LBJ or
Richard Nixon, the War in
Vietnam is wrong, and to change

, things we must go to the polls."

After receiving a standing ova-
tion, Lowenstein characterized
opponents of the War as “tired,
bruised, and frustrated, but more
committed than ever.”

The President of the Vietnam
Veterans against the" War, John
Kerry, told the group that veter-
ans found the war "obscene”
and said “the war should appear
to be obscene to everyone in
the nation.” He urged young vot-
ers to take advantage of their
power to end the war.

“Because we have believed
we’re powerless we actually
have become powerless and have
gotten trapped in a vicious
circle,” Kerry said. ‘

He,cited the protest last May
ingWashington and their continu-
ing efforts. “The Veterans
against the war aren’t going to
settle for a government that
concerns itself ‘more with where
men sleep than with where it
drops bombs."

-Shirley Chisolm, Congress-
woman from New York, told the
audience, “if we don’t register
to vote this nation will never
come together. Never before in
the history of the Republic has
there been a time when people
are lashing out against them-
selves as they are now,” she
concluded.

The ioliowing is the iirst at a
three part series in which Pitt News
reporter Stove Zyrh examines mill:
tory alternatives at the University.

"ROTC offers an alternative to
the draft" is the way Colonelnndy
Daugherty evaluates the situation
that faces college freshmen this
year.

College freshmenwili no longer

'lecti_ve Service Act is finally pass=

ed. The bill -has been held up in.
Congress slncelate May. passage
is expected by the end of October.
Col. Daugherty. a 20 year vet-
eran of the Air Force and head of

the Air Force ROTC department >

at Pitt. stated. “ﬂ0'I‘C Iii the blﬂ=

gest single source of officers for-

our armed forces. Though we
have had a dark past we have an
opportunity tor a brighter future.
The reality for the present.
though. is that we need men for
our Armed Forces."

Both the Army and Air Force
maintain ROTC} staffs. at Pitt.
Both are housed on the fourth
floor of the Cathedral of i.ear-ning.

_ Both ‘are four year programs. al-
though a student can drop out or

either before the third year.
"We encourage the men to

make their own decision about the

military." said Daugherty. “We
let them itnow about both the good
and the bad aspects of military
life. e.g.. the war. the low pay.
the long periods away from your
loved ones. and let each intlivid=
uai matte his own tiecision."

“We let the individual know that
there is nothing wrong with drop:
ping ollt of the program if he feels
it's not for him. All we ask is that
people take a look and find out
what it's like." added the colonel.

The final two years of-the Bi)‘i’C
program stress leadership and
are apreparation for entry into
active military duty.

During orientation last month, Social Commissioner Lenny Kla-
.yv.onic spoke to a group of freshmen attending Horror Flicks. Kla-
onic‘s purpose was to familiarize the new students with the con-
vert schedule he had planned for the coming year. , -

H‘ . Klavonic rattled off a list of exciting_performersfBlood, Sweat,
'nd Tears, Ike and Tina Turner, the Fifth D1mension—to the Wild
1 approval of the freshmen. Klavonic seemed to be adding feathers
lo his cap, but we who have been around campus a bit longer have
ome to be suspicious of things kept under that cap. -

 1 What“Klavonic didn’t tell the .freshmen was that in fact, he
’.had contracted only one major group, Blood, Sweat, and Tears,
':.for the coming year.

 Contracts were mailed to Ike and Tina months ago; nothing has
been heard from them since, though Klavonic maintains they are
»-coming. The Fifth Dimension returned their contract with 16 pages
‘of complicated riders; one administrator who has helped book
groups on (campus for several years said that “we will be very
lucky" to land the Fifth Dimension.Klavonic‘s efforts_ to contract
- the original cast of "Jesus Christ, Superstar" have failed completely.

- ‘Even the one concert that Klavonic has booked came perilously
_c'los,e_-to, falling through. The date for the BS&T concert has been
éfchanged several times within the past few weeks. Signs plastered
falliover campus advertise the concert for Saturday, Sept. 25. As of
{this writing, the concert will take place Thursday, Sept. 23.

,. Concerts, of course, are hardly the most important events in the
“ lives of most students. All other things beingequal, we might shrug
off Klavonic’s seeming incompetence and peccadilloes and find sub-
istitute forms of entertainment.

Until Thursday’s Vo.ter Registration Rally, Pitts— ‘

 , burgh peace gatherings have'been plaqued with police
I - hassles. -

Fortunately, the one held in Point State Park
yesterday’ had only one such incident. In the inter-
ests of presenting all the facts, here’s how the con-
frontation went:

An average-size man with reddish hair and giant
bushy eyebrows attempted to enter the rally site. A
wise policeman near the entrance spotted the sus-
picious-looking character and stopped him.

“Where ya think you're goin’, buddy?” he asked_.
“Why, in to see, my students,” the man stammered.

“What are ya, one of those troublemakers who
teaches the kids all the wrong things about democracy
J just for personal gain?”

“No, no," the man laughed. “I’m with Pitt. . . 

“What’s your name, fella?” the cop_butted in be-
_fore the man could explain.

“Well, most people call me Uncle Wes.”

“Uh huh, sure. One of those mystic leader types.
Hey, what’s that in your pocket?”

“Why, that’s my bicycle chain."

“A likely story, a guy your age on a bike. Are you

looking for trouble at a Voter Registration Drive?” The
policeman tightened his grip on his nightstick.

' “No! I just wrap this chain around my bike and a
tree.. . . I ride to and from work every day to help keep
in shape.”

“Well, you better not let me catch you with that
in the park or I’ll haul you in for disturbin’ the peace."

-“Officer,” the Chancellor said," “I think you‘re
makinga mistake. . 

“Move along, buddy,” the policeman ordered
I sternly.

And with that, the man turned and walked slowly
into the park, his pride hurt, and wondering how the
system could ever turn against a person who only want-
ed to improve it

All other things, however, are far from equal. For Klavonic is
f'inancing his calendar or lack of one with $75,000 in Students’ Ac-
tivities..Fees. Klavonic originally asked the Allocations Committee

for over$121,000, but the Committee trimmed his request to the low- ,

er amount.

Hardly a modest figure, but Klavonic was not satisfied. He
sought and got the unanimous consent of his fellow Commissioners
to a plan whereby he can spend the Social Commission's allocation
in any manner he desires, provided he gets the approval of the
Commission for all expenditures and submits bi-weekly budgets to

them.

Apparently, Klavonic has been granted a virtual carte blanche.
He has so far submitted no budgets, and it’s anybody’s guess as to
where our $75,000 is going. Concerts, obviously would be a bad

guess.

There are nodoubt difficulties in pinning top-name performers
to specified dates. It is equally certain that these difficulties can

be and have been overcome. V

Bill Lenaghen, Assistant Director of Student Activities, said
that "in the past, groups have been booked much earlier in the
year." Frequently, entertainment’ for the entire first term had been

contracted before school began.

5

Such is not the case this year. With only one major concert
solid at this late date, it is unlikely that Pitt -students will see much

in the way of quality entertainment.

Out of every 10 dollars awarded to all student organizations
by the Allocations Committee, Lenny Klavonic got three. At those
prices, we have a right to expect more.

Szabo Food Service was hired
this summer in hopes of serving
the resident student body bet-
ter than the Saga. And although
in some ways they have com-
plied, such as the addition of far
superior vending equipment,
they still have a long way to
go before they achieve the cali-
ber that students are hoping for.

One of Szabo’s strongest
claims to fame is its intentions
of meeting the needs of the stu-
dents. Service is practically
their password. And let's face it,
a lot of services can provide de-
cent menus, but there are other

~. be dealt with in order to create

a successful service.

It is only ironic, that this
area is where Szabo falls short.

Many ‘students complain, for
example, that it is ridiculous to
close the cafeteria at 12:30 on
Saturday. Maybe this seems
minor, but~many students use
Saturday to sleep in.

Maybe it isn't particularly
noticeable now, but wait until

with fraternity rush and the foot-
ball season, not to mention

‘ just plain old Rest and Recuper-

ation around mid-term.

Sage kept its doors open until
1 p.m. Couldn’t Szabo do so just
as easily? '

As for their Sunday meal, they
claim they are helping the stu-
dents by providing “brunch”
hours. No complaints as far as
their intentions go, but why

serve a full turkey-and-stuffing
dinner for “brunch”? Sage rem-
edied this by offering both a
breakfast and lunch line at these

.hours, and serving the main

meal later.

And Saturday nights used to
be steak night. Nobody has ‘seen
a steak yet from Szabo, except
for a freshman orientation. Their
Saturday meal. isn’t even close-
to anything special. Saturdays
are date nights and the nights
alumni visit during the athletic
season. Why not return to the
old Saturday menus of steak
chicken or fish?

It must be remembered that
Szabo is new, and is still likely,

to be in the organizational stage.. I

Also, to be fair, they did pass
out questionnaires.

It is now up to Szabo to prove
itself by totally meeting the
needs of the residents who must
regularly eat there and pay 300
dollars for the right. I

Dating Turns Casual

by CAROLE COVAL
If somebody asked you about

.the social climate here at Pitt,

what would you say? I‘ve been
racking my brain for about a
week, thinking about it."

At first, I thought maybe
somebody would want to know
about dating and dressing pat-
terns, or where the ‘In’ place
to go on a Saturday night;is. But
there are no real" (imagined?)
problems there. ‘

If you -want to go out on a
date, you ask somebody. As far
as putting on clothes, a little or
as much as you like and feel

comfortable in. Don't even
ask me where ‘in’ is.

I consulted the American
College Dictionary for some
guidance, but all I got was some
nebulous definition (thirteen

of them)‘of‘ what ‘social’ means

"to. the_experts. Besides the one-

 

about diseases, all the rest had
the word ‘pertaining’ in them.

I didn’t mention‘ anything
about horror movies, or Tower
B, or MacDonald‘s or Wolfarth’s,
or Shadyside, or even Schenley
Park. I guess the word ‘social’
doesn‘t even apply to Pitt.

What really has happened
though, is that social customs
and traditions have turned casu-
al. Dating is performed in the
group setting, and the ancient
‘salon’ has turned into the mid-
night rap session in somebody’s
room or apartment.

Contracted, or homemade
entertainment has taken the
place of the ‘social occasion.’
‘Going out’ is no longer the
dream of a lonely person, un-
less it’s to play frisbee, or foot-
ball, or to picnic somewhere. »

Urban Congestion Persists

  Agnew H

Vice President Spiro Agnew
admitted Wednesday that the
United States trails behind
Germany, Japan, and other na-
tions in the development of
urban transportation systems.

Addressing the fifth annual In-
ternational Conference on Urban
Transportation at the Pittsburgh
Hilton, Agnew told foreign vis-
itors they "have taken many
strides ahead of us in the field of
urban transportation.”

While Agnew labeled Americas
interstate highway system "sec-
ond to none in the world." he
warned that “transportation is
not a matter of either good high-
ways or a good urban transit sys-
tem.“ Instead, he said. "we need
both.“

Urging “sound, comprehensive,
long-range planning,” Agnew sug-
gested the construction of “new
towns and satellite cities,” in
America, based on a Stockholm
model ‘where 18 satellite cities
surround the inner city.

According to Agnew, the Swed-r

ish experiment,affords residents
of the satellite cities "easy ac-
cess to downtown." Some of the
satellite cities, he said. are only
five or 10 minutes away from the

urban core.

Avoiding an overly gloomy por-

trait of urban transportation in

1 Social Work
B.A. Initiated

In an attempt to meet the short-
age of trained professionals in so-
cial work positions, the Universi-
ty's School of Social Work has ini-
tiated a new undergraduate pro-
gram leading to a bachelor of arts
degree in social work.

Curriculum for the first year
of study will include an overview
of the legal, historical and eco-
nomic aspects of social welfare
development and an introduction
to social work and social welfare
studies. The second-year curricu-
lum will involve direct experience
 one or more social welfare
agencies. --

The new program is aimed at
the paraprofessional ‘already

’ working in a social welfare agen-

cy who desires to improveihis or
her position via further study;
the young student who wants to

A pursue a career in social work

and/or do graduate study in so-
cial work; and the student who
wants to study sociafwelfare on
an elective basis.

-The new undergraduate pro-
gram is under_ the direction of
Professor Ann Jones and is not
expected to exceed 150 students.

the United States. Agnew noted-

that completely new’ transit sys-
tems will be developed in, San
Francisco. Washington. D. C..
and perhaps Baltimore during the
next decade. He added that pre-
sent systems in New York. Phil-
adelphia, Boston. and Chicago will
eventually be extended. \

Agnew emphasized that a city’s
prosperity greatly depends on its
transportation system. “New
York’s extensive rapid transit
system played a major role over
a period of many years inthe de-
velopment of Manhattan Island
as one of the world’s great hubs

  

Fantastic

its Transit Lag

of commerce,” he said, quipping
that such a system is “partial
compensation for having to start
each morning with the New York
Times."

According to Agnew. the Nixon
administration places a high
priority on urban transportation

problems. Before Nixon became

President. Agnew said. "Federal

funding for public transit never

exceeded $200 million a year."
This year, he said. the funding
amounts to $900 million.

Agnew. who was closely guard-
ed by a crew of Secret Service-
men. federal marshalls. and local
policeman. was literally given the
red carpet treatment at the Hil-
ton. as one was unfurled for the
occasion. '

Students from the Pittsburgh
Academy, waving small Ameri-
can flags and blowing soap bub-
bles, came to the Hilton to hear
Agnew speak, but their entry was
barred. A contingent of half a doz-'
en Vietnam Veterans Against the
War also appeared to protest what
they consider inadequate GI bene-
fits for Vietnam War veterans and
the Nixon administration’s al-
leged failure to grapple with the
problem of heroin addiction in
Vietnam. ~

The Vice President was usher-

ed briskly in and out and refus-
ed to answer any questions.

Bicyclists who ride their bikes
to campus run the risk of hav-
" ing them stolen. And in all pro-
fbability, according to Joe Gil.
.Head of Campus Security, they
(bicycles) will never be found.

f “It is difficult to determine a
proper owner from an improper
one,” Superintendent Gil remark-
 ed. “Not one bike in a hundred
. , has a license or registration plate,
“which are removable anyway.
‘_ What it amounts to is one per-

sons word against the other."

According to Gil’s estimation,
.l the summer averaged two re-
7 ported thefts per month. He
 added, however, that “many more
. have gone unreported.”

.As a result, “there is an in-
creased awareness” within Cam-

watched. “We are now question-

ing trouble opening locks, for
that may indicate a possible ’
theft.”

However, "prevention of theft
starts‘ with the owner." Gil em-
phasized. “A lot of people leave
their bicycles unsecured when
they go into buildings for a
short time. When they come out.
they find their bikes missing."

He suggested that students
"invest in a good lock and sub-
stantial chain.“ It is also advis-
able, he added, “to mark the
bike in some observable fashion"
which would facilitate identifi-
cation should it be stolen.

For students whose bicycles
have been stolen, Gil recom-
mended that they inquire about

homeowners insurance.

more Biology major, criticized
Campus Security for being “a
little loose.” “More bicycle
racks are needed, not only by
the Student Union, but by the
Cathedral and the David Law-
rence Hall as well,” he said.

Another student. nodding in
agreement, complained that
there aren‘t enough racks. She
suggested that bicycle owners
"should use good locks and
strong chains.”

Finally, James A. Gray. a
second year graduate student in
Chemical Engineering, comment-
ed that "there isn't too much
that Security can do, since there
is no bicycle registration." Ac-
cording to Gray, the owner must
be responsiblefor his own bike.
"It should be secured so that the
chain goes around the main bar
through the tire." he explained.

SU Floor Space
Changes Hands

by MARY WELTY

Director of Student Activities
Bill Markus has announced re-
cent office reassignments in the
Student Union affecting several
departmentsof the Student Af-
fairs area. .

Previously contemplated in
January. the moves were held
up until several academic de-
partments could move from the
Union to their newly-prepared
spaces. These shifts, said Markus,
were made in order to consoli-
date the Student Affairs staff
responsibilities, to provide easier
traffic patterns for students vis-
iting personnel offices; to cut
down the heavy traffic on the
two elevators, and to provide
more student offices and meet-
ingrooms.

The Admissions and Aid Of-
fices have been reorganized and
combined into one operation, the
Admissions Office, now located
on the sixth floor. Formerly the
Admissions office was located
on the first floor while the Stu-

Allocations Committee

dent Aid staff operated out of
several offices on the third floor.
The Student Activities Office
has been moved from the fifth
floor of the Union to the first

floor. which, according to Mar- .

kus, will provide students with
easy access to co-curricular and
extra-curricular activities offices.
The Student Publications advisor
has been moved from the fourth
floor to the first floor to provide
additional student offices for
groups on four.

The Specialty Programs office
has remained on the fifth floor
but it has moved into a new suite
of offices. Work is under way
to have phones installed in the

previous offices of student office

space which has been needed
for several years. When this work
is finished further reassignment
of student offices will be an-
nounced.

‘Also, three revolving offices
in the Union will be made avail-

-able to student groups on a reser-

vation basis. I

Knocks SA Structure

The Allocations Committee has
issued the following statement:

1) The Allocations’ Committlae

does not wishtto-submititself to

the uncontrolled mee-tings with y

the Student Commissioners until
suchtime when definite proce-
dures,‘ responsible behavior, and
a more diplomatic attitude are
sustained in such a meeting.

2) It isthe feeling of the Al-
locations’ Committee that a def-
inite procedure for the recalling
and review -of budgets and funds
be established immediately.

3-) It is also theifeeling of the ‘

Allocatio_n_s’._ Committee" that" the
Student Commissioners recognize .

the right of this committee" to 5

amend and enact its own bylaws.

4) We feel that,_the structure, of
student government as it now
stands, is in desperate need of an
effective system of checks and
balances and does not function
smoothly as a legislative body nor

_ does it come close to meeting the

speedy inherent, demands of the

students, for whom it is supposed
to operate. Therefore, the Alloca-

where they affect allocation pro-

feel this problem deserves im-
mediate attention and should be
carried out in accordance with
point one.

5) Finally, the Allocations’ Com-
mittee feels that at this time and

_under prevailing circumstances _

a joint Allocation and Student As-
sociation meeting tends only to
magnify the inefficiencies of the

Student "Association structure, , '
thereby decreasing the potential _

benefits to the students and seri-
ously threatening thefuture-of
the Student Association and its
function to serve the students ef-

jficiently. The Allocations’ Com-E ~

mittee will continue to carry out
as many of its duties as possible
without yielding to the Student
Association pressures.

Bloc Worries politicos Friday, S'eptemberi10, 1971—frHi~ir>iTT'N‘ié:ws¥iP-age

(Associated Press)

Newly enfranchised young peo-
ple are finding detours on the road
to the ballot box. The path is
blocked in some communities by
confusing registration rulings and
local officials who areworried
about the effects of student voting
power. '

Central to nationwide debate on
the subject is the college student:
is his place of residence forvoting
purposes the town in which he
goes to- school or the community
in which his parents live?

Another body of opinion holds col-
lege students would be deprived of
the right to vote if they had to do
so at their parents‘ place of resi-
dence.

Some officials see college stu-
dents “radicalizing” community
legislative and administrative
bodies because of their ability to
outvote permanent residents in a

' number of towns.

Other officials see college stu-
dents voting expenses for com-
munities, then moving on after
graduation and leaving perma-
nent residents to foot the bill for

HARMONY prevails at sharp new Music Department flat.‘

Music Department

 Relocateol At WQED

by MARY WELTY

The large stone building at the
corner of Fifth Ave. and Belle-
field St. is the new location of the-
music department.

The building, which _used to
house WQED educational TV sta-
tion,‘ is still being renovated to
provide new practice rooms,
classrooms, a library and tape
center, and faculty and adminis-

trative offices for the department. ‘

According to Dr. Robert Show,
head of the music department,
there has been an increased ex"-
pansion of the department in the
past three. years. During that per-_
iod, the faculty, has doubled and

' the numberof music majors has

increased from less than half a
dozen to 80.

Three new members have been
added to the faculty this year.
Frank McCarty, composer and
theorist who will work with elec-
tronic music; Edmond Williams,“
director of thejibiand; and Robert"
Kidd, III, Williams’.assistant. The
department has-also started to ad-

-ivise,.its. majors beginning with
ﬁtheir’. freshman ‘year which, ac,-
» cording to Snow may be a reason
. forthe increase inmajors. along

ment. _ ' I ,

two-term conducting,

course this year. Also the [depart-

ment is planning to initiate a pro- ‘

gram of courses in the School of
General Studies for students and"
the surrounding community, lead-
ing to a certificate in music.

4 All classes for majors are being
held at the new location of the de-

partment, however, some courses ‘

geared to non-majors will still be
taught in David Lawrence] Hall

and the Frick Fine Arts building. ,

The band will remain at the stadi-
um. Practice rooms are open to
majors and to non-majors enroll-
ed in a music course.

The answer can have an impor-
tant impact on the political make-
up and social direction of towns
where students sometimes out-
number permanent residents.

But an Associated Press sur-
vey showed a confusing variety of
rulings on the subject. State offi-

V cials in many areas simply issued

no opinion at all and left the ques-
tion up to local election boards.

An estimated 11.4 million per-

, sons became eligible to vote in all

elections with the adoption of the
26th amendment to the Consti-
tution extending the franchise to
any citizen 18 or over.

Of these, students account for
an estimated 4.9 million.

And it is about the latter that
the controversy swirls. One body
of opinion sees a danger in per-
mitting students to vote and reg-
ister in the place they go to school.

Refreshing SoundWaves,.

by RON LOZOWSKI

God only knows what we'd do without
the Beach Boys. The band has deluged list-
eners with waves of good vibrations ever
since its inception.

For the latter part of their careers they
have labored unjustly under a much-ma-
ligned surfer/hot-rodding image, while in
reality advancing from the sandbox to con-
struct magical musical castles.

Surf’s Up is another investigation of un-
explored directions in the musical realm.
characterized by a freshness and exuber-
ance unrivaled in the current rock spec-
trum. Conventional labels prove pitifully
inadequate—one may only note the recog-
nizable style,‘ and indefinable purity. Per-
haps a more appropriate term would be
"progressive innocence: partial, partially
kept," to quote Robert Creeley.

Rather than relinquish their child-like

ment in making monetary recom-

qualities, the Beach Boys have retained
them as integral aspects of their work.
Consequently, the lyrics (and often the
melodies) contain traces of an impish hu-
mor' that can’t help but bring a smile. The
sparkling creations evoke a rare and pre-
cious aura of sheer delight.

The disc opens with “Don‘t Go Near
the Water.“ a mildly satirical ecology
song featuring a deceptively-tinkling back-
ground that is simultaneously simple,gsad.
and comic: “Don‘t go near the water,
Don‘t you think it's sad/Whats happening
to the water, Our water‘s going bad." ' T

The lyrical naivity demonstrated here
and in such "fun‘” numbers as “Take a
Load Off Your Feet" stands in sharp con-
trast to the instrumental and harmonic
complexity of the collection. Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young could still learn a thing or
two from the Beach Boys, who remain the
premier vocal group in existence.

All of the anticipation, excite-
ment, and talk about the college
football season comes to a cli-
max tomorrow night as the Pan-
thers Oppose the UCLA Bruins
in the ominous Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum at 10:30
Pittsburgh time.

It will be the thirteenth
straight meeting between the
two schools with. the Uclans
holding an 8-4 advantage in the
series including wins in the last
' five straight.

Both teams’ strength has been
a matter of debate among the
pollsters and writers that decide
pre—season rankings. Just as Pitt
has been considered from being
sixth in the East to tenth in the
country, the Bruins were named
14th in the nation by one group,
and a lowly sixth for the -Pacific
Eight Conference.

THE Pitt versus UCLA football
game will be telecast tomorrow
night at 10:30 p.m. over WTAE
channel 4. The newscasters will
be Tom Bender and Ray Goss
for this year’s Panther action.

Coincidentally, both head

coaches see their strengths and

weaknesses lying in the same
areas. Pitt’s Carl DePasqua and
UCLA‘s Pepper Rodgers cite
their offensive lines and line-
backers as their strong points,
while they both entertain doubts
about their‘ inexperienced defens-

1968 Orange Bowl. Previous to

, his tenure at Kansas, he served

as assistant Coach at UCLA
under last year’s boss, Tommy
Prothro.

/ Pepper was non—committa1
about his decision about his start-
ing quarterback. With the de-
parture of Dennis Dummit, Rod-
gers has‘ a choice between two
junior college transfers-Mike
Flores, and Ed Galigher.

“Depending on the position of

the ball when we get it, I’ll'

decide between Flores who is. a
better pure passer and Galigher
who is the better runner,” he
stated. “However, they both run
the same offense.”

‘DePasqua firmly stated that
John Hogan, who riddled the
Bruin offense last year, will
direct the Panther attack. With
sophomore Bob Medwid con-
sidered his backup, senior Dave
Havern will be playing “differ-
ent positions” according to De-
Pasqua.

Pulling into Stuckert's Esso

of Forbes‘ and Bouquet streets
in Oaklandlon a hot August
afternoon for gas, I was aston-

V ished at who was awaiting me

there.

The stations attendant came
running to my car to .wait on
me, then preceded to service the
car at a veryspeedy pace.

What was this?. Was this the
ultimate in gimmickry in which
service stations often employ
themselves in to show superior
service? Was the attendant in-

volved in some sort of contest? .

No, it was 'I‘rack-Cross Country

Chesebrough, who holds the
Pitt record in the track six mile
run (29.10) and who will be one
of the top prospects for the Har-
riers in the coming Cross Coun-
try season, had a very busy sum-
mer in Pittsburgh both ,working
and training. He worked at
Stuckert’s_ from eight to four and
then painted houses from four

training day would end with a"

So say the football guide released by the University of Cali=
fornia at Los Angeles. Unfortunately. James McAllster will not

‘ be able to test his unlimited potential. at least not in the realm

of collegiate sports. ’
McA_llster has been ruled ineligible for all collegiate corn=

. Whether or not Mt-Alister was just or unjustly accused of
his crime is not my issue here but one to be settled by the courts.
McAllster"s-appeal was defeated. . i

The thing that astounds me is the aura of glory that sur=
rounded this i9=year=old sophomore as he blasted his way into

college football. According to his Coach Pepper Rodgers, “lies

a better runner than anyone I've had at this stage of his enr'eer."'

' Pitt Coach Cari DePasqua was generous in his praise. De= . "

Pasqua witnessed the play of McAlister last May at UCLA's an=

nual prlng game, -

_“McAlister is the best sophomore prospect I've ever seen."
stated DePasqua. ,

When Rodgers was asked about the loss of McAllster he
tried to minimize the consequences to his team. He commented
sadly. “We'll miss those so yard runs. He was a tremendous
break=away threa “ ,

Then Rodgers was asked if it is true that UCLA will stay
out of the air more this year and the quick. curt reply was "that

-- was before McAlister.'-‘

Although he was untested on the varsity level, McAlister did
plenty of damage in the Bruins’ spring game. The graduate of
Blair High in Pasadena. Calif., carried the ball 28 times for 170

yards. That comes to no less that than 7.4. yards per carry.

or the ACT on ‘fnatlonal testing dates" if they are seeking flnan=

Zelmo Defends His Crown f5"“C9"'"9"

Slowed By 

No Money

Due to some extensive budget
cuts by the Pitt Athletic Depart-
ment, the soccer teams scrim-
mage, which was scheduled for to-
morrow, Sept. 11, has been can-
celled.

The scrimmage was to take
place against Davis-Elkins of
West Virginia. Davis-Elkins was
the runner-up for the small col-
lege division soccer champion-

‘ ship last year. In a 1970 contest

the two teams tied 2-2.

The reason for the cancellation
of the pre-season battle comes
from a statement made by the
Athletic Department. The depart-
ment feels that the game is an
‘unnecessary expenditure.” In
line with this reason the Athletic
Department has already refused
funding of the rifle team (see arti-
cle on page 10) and is planning
further budget cuts in the near
future: .
