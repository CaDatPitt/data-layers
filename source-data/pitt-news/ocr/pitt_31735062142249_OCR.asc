 Raid Plans

Géin Elliciency,  
Geise Reports

Dr. John J. Geise, associate pro-
fessor of history and chief air
raid warden of the Cathedral, re-
ports thatthe Universityiair raid
protection service7 is constantly be-
ing worked on and developed to a
greater efficiency.

Thirty-seven new air raid
wardens, all‘ members of the Uni-
versity faculty or administra-

 tive stalf, will be graduated from
Pitt's air raid warden’s training:
class tomorrow.

1 Within the next week a course
in ﬁrst aid will be started. This
course is for the purpose of train-
ing 'men and women, who have
completed the air raid training
course, in the fundamentals of ﬁrst
aid. It is prescribed by the Civiliain
Defense council that all air raid
wardens must be trained in ﬁrst
aid. This ﬁrst aid class will add
twenty-ﬁve fully authorized air
raid wardens to the University air

I raid protection service.

By the time of the next air raid
alert corps of ﬁre watchers will
be in operation. These ﬁre watch-
ers, all University faculty or ad-
ministrative oﬂicers, will operate
from the parapets on the roof of
the Cathedral.

Dr. Geise said that the Univer-
'ity air raid protection service is
looking to an increased use of stu-
’dents within the organization soon
after the fall semester begins.

He made it known that the
Shadyside Academy building and
the Allegheny Observatory now
have complete telephone warning
systems, which link them in with
the rest of the University proper-
ties. Thiswarning system operat-
ed efficiently during last Wednes-
ﬂag/’s air raid drill.

-Rita Donnelly Selected
For WAAC Training

Rita Kathryn Donnelly, C45, has
the. distinction of being the ﬁrst
undergraduate woman of the Uni-
versity to be selected for oﬂicer
training in WAAC.

While attending the University,
Miss Donnelly was taking the pre-
legal course in the College. Before
coming to’ Pitt, she worked in
Boggs and Buhl’s bookkeeping de-
partment for two years and three
years as secretary to an attorney.

Last week, a service club gave
Miss Donnelly a farewell party in
the Fifth United Presbyterian
church of Northside.

clubs and discussion groups to the
end that its members will ﬁnd
facilitated their entry into the vari-
ous service branches.

Several plans have been ad-
vanced by coordinator Edward
Tablac, BA43, acting chairman
of the organization. First, Tab-
’lac plans to bring in various
oﬂicers in the services to address
- the ..club, in “a sort of pre-ser-
vice orientation group.”

Second, individual student prob-
lems for getting in and staying in
the various enlisted corps will be
considered by the group through
discussions led by student mem-
bers.

Lastly, contact will be made with
students already in each of the
service branches, and through such
contact, Tablac feels that mem-
bers of the Reserves club will be
able to pick up training hints, sug-
gestions as what courses to take,
pointers as to how to get in top
physical shape for the entrance
into the services.

Working directly on plans for
tomorrow’s meeting with Tablac is
Lawrence R. Irwin, coordinator of
service opportunities at the Uni-
versity.

Both Mr. Irwin and Tablac
stressed the importance of every
enlisted reserve’s attending to-
morrow’s session. The group
meeting tomorrow afternoon will
be the nucleus for further ex-
pansion in scope as well as in
size, they declared.

I The meeting, they stressed, will
begin promptly at 1:45 and will
last no longer than drill hour, in
order that those attending can
make their afternoon classes. '

Because of the need» for“ the
maximum amount of instruction-
al time in the summer semester,
the last week (September 10-16)
will not be set aside for ﬁnal ex-
aminations‘ alone. Classes will
continue to and including Wed-
nesday, September 16.

The examinations are to be
conducted during one or more of
the closing class sessions. Stu-
dents _ should be dismissed
promptly at the close of each
class period to avoid conflicts
with other examinations.

Final grades will be due in the
Office of the Registrar on Thurs-
day, September 17. There is need
for promptness in grade report-
ing as the blueprints must be
available for review in the oﬂices
of the deans before fall registra-
tion, which begins Wednesday,
September 23.

The co-operation of the.fac-
ulty will be appreciated.
J. G. Quick,
Registrar.

Druids Open
Second Front,

Relaunch lowa

Seizing upon a desperate meas-
ure in an attempt to increase re-
sults _of recent sales, Druids will
open the much-discussed second
front tomorrow.

A new booth will be set up on
the main ﬂoor of the Cathedral
near the Fifth Avenue entrance.

On Thursday of last week, the
United States battleship Iowa, a
45,000 ton man-of-war completed
seven months ahead of schedule,
was launched at the Brooklyn Navy
yard.

The Iowa has been the symbol
used during the stamp and bond
drive on campus, and is a sub-
stantial representation of the
projects to which the govern-

_ment is turning the funds that
are rolling in all over the nation
from the sales of stamps and
bonds.

Here on campus, members of the

stamp and bond drive committee"

have expressed the hope that the
funds contributed by students and
faculty have found their way into
the construction of the ship.

“The incentive furnished by the
news of the launching of the $88,-
000,000 Iowa should help tomor-
row’s sales immensely,” announced
Chairman Irving Leiber, C44, who
intends to go ahead with plans
for the establishment of the “sec-

ond front.”

o Both the ground floor and the
ﬁrst ﬂoor sales booths will be
open tomorrow from 9 until 4
o’cldck, with an ample supply of
stamps and bonds. The salesmen
have been instructed also to
make as many individual con-
tacts as ‘possible at all points on
the campus.

Last week's sales, low mark for
the summer drive, yielded only
$120, of which $37.50 was in bonds,
and $82.50 represented stamp sales.
The only bright spot was the fact

that stamp sales reached a sum- ‘

mer peak.

This is the last issue of the
summer semester Pitt News.

We are not yet certain just ex-
actly when the next one will ap-
pear—but it will be sometime
during the last week in Septem-
ber——maybe a little earlier, if cir-
cumstances permit putting out a
special freshman edition.

Due to an expected lean year .

in advertising income, it is un-
certain how many times a week
the News will come out this fall.
We’ll try to publish tri-weekly
as in the past. This may be im-
possible and we’ll have to cut
down to twice a week.

Or we may have to alter the
schedule still further, and with
it the format of the paper itself,
to meet war emergency condi-
tions. Be on your toes and ex-
pect anything.

 We are of the opinion that Street and Smith’s engaged
ﬁction writer to write football, because Pitt has "not passed
e ‘era of de-emphasis anymore today than it had done last
ar at this time. And if it is true that square-shouldered
enllhave been roaming the Cathedral, we think it only fair
‘ell head coach Charley Bowser. '
:It’s true Pitt will have a ﬁne team. We should even go
-ar as to say a good team, but we are still going to lose

‘ x

_. games. Probably as many as last year’s team, but it will
a better squad. ’ , -
The schedule is_ similar in strength to last fall’s pro-
em. The opener is with the perennial champion of the
ntry, Minnesota, then in order comes Southern Metho-
ft,’ Great Lakes Naval Training Station, Indiana, Duke,
rnegie Tech, Ohio State, Nebraska, and Penn State. Not
n~.e..chance for a letdown. .
. Probably Pitt’s outstanding asset this fall will be their
plendid backﬁeld composed of Dutton, Stetler, West, Saksa,
DiMatteo. Tony DiMatteo, soph back from Perry high
‘.001, should bear watching for his ball playing in the past

era-squad games tags him as the boy most likely to suc- L

d.
it onﬁdence playsabig part in victory. And this fall
wser’s men will have that conﬁdence. They probably won’t
7n the opener with Minnesota, but they will be a threat, not
A A a mere eleven men with jerseys and helmets.
So, this fall we don’t know which we are going to do,
,1; home every Saturday afternoon reading of Pitt’s vic-
ies in Street and Smith’s publication, or amble up to the
adium and watch a ﬁghting ball club drop a few games.

Bowser Opens Drills Tomorrow,

Smallest Grid Squad In History

By JERRY_RIPP _ l
The grind starts again tomorrw.

‘Those members of Pitt’s football

team who are attending summer
classes will start the long practice
drills that precede every gridiron

campaign. Next Monday the rest.

of the smallest grid squad in Blue
and Gold football history will re-
port for drills.

When the whole team convenes
on the hill behind the stadium
only 40 athletes will greet Coach
Charlie Bowser and the aides he
has left. Those‘ gridders that are
attending classes will take part
in only one session each day, while
the rest of the squad will work-
out twice daily. After the sum-
mer term ends the entire squad
will grunt and sweat through the
double drills.

With another “suicide” schedule
facing the Panthers, Bowser has a
big job facing him as he tries to
mold a winning combination out of
the limited amount of material on
hand. Of the 40 players expected

to make up the squad during the

practice sessions only 18 will don
their togs tomorrow.

Included among those reporting
tomorrow are: Norb Gestner, Bill
Kyle, Jack Durishan, Joe Salvucci,
John Baker, Bill Dillon, Francis
Mattiolo, Bill Wachter, George
Allshouse, Loren Braner, Walt
West, Bill Dutton, Jack Stetler,
Angelo Carlaccini, Martin Rose-
lpink Lou Alamprese, Frank
Saksa and Joe Skladany.

_ Standout member of the squad
reporting next Monday will be
Tony Dimatteo, 180, pound sopho-

more halfback. Dimatteo first drew K
attention last year as the star of
the freshman team and then this
past spring he was the outstand-
ing performer during the spring
practice drills. Fast and shifty, A

If Bowser can build up a strong ‘

line to go with the backﬁeld of ‘ i

Walt West, Jack Stetler, Bill Dut-
ton and Frank Saksa or Dimatteo
the Panthers may surprise every-
one this year and come through
with a good season. It’s not too
impossible. « A

Invitations to upperclassmen to
serve on the staﬁ’ are beginning to
be sent out and will continue until
