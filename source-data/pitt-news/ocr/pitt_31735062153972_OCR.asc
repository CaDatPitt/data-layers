.wasi_the fairest-example of good treat-.

mentthat our team has received in
years. They met our boys with auto-
mobiles'at the station, and gave ‘them
the privileges of the whole institution.

a thing rarely offered to any visitors.

After the game they cheered the Pitt
men and gave themea royalreception
in -the dormitory. Dinner was more
like a family reunion than a_ farewell
(llI'l1'l€I"_l'.O an opposing team. The Pitt
supporters were conﬁdent that they
had won the. game on a touchdown
when ‘Wagner grabbed the ball on a
forward ‘pass and crossed the goal line;
but as the referee thought that the
ball had touched a Pitt man before it
was caught, the score did ‘not count.
Althoughthis is an unpleasant affair
for us it is: one of the occurrences
that is sure’ to happen in any game
and Pitt is not kicking. Navyfs play-
ing was notup. to their“ usual form,
but before t‘he‘season is over; they
promise to have astrong team. ‘The
officials were v”ery fair in all their de-

cisions. 1' ‘

TRACK ‘HOUSE

' The latest addition to‘ Pitt’s fast.-
growing group of buildings on the
Schenley Farms campus is the new
‘-‘Track House." It has been; started,
built, and entirely completed during“
-the three months. of July, August and
September, an ‘achievement which sets
anew record forefast construction in
the .University group. It is located
on the southwest corner of the Trees
Stadium, conveniently accessible to
the ﬁeld, the gymnasium‘-11and De Soto
street. 1 1 n‘ L .

The principalpurppose of the track‘
house is to provide‘ a home for the
members of the Varsity football
squad, from «their return from1 Camp
~Hamilton, until the end. ‘of the grid-1
iron season. Here they can live’, eat
at trainingﬂtable; and sleep, ‘without
the possibility of interruption. After
the football season is over, it is
pvlannfﬁi to use the structure for a
dormitory, to house regular students.
It will thus become the first perma-
nent dormitory ofthe University.

. .The.track house is rectangular in-
s1l_1ape,.aoproximately 30 x 50] feet in

dimensions, and of . semi-classic "arch-

itec_ture,.to harmonize withthe other

University buildings.’ It is busilt. of

buff brick, with lighter trimmings, and"
is roofed with -green tile, trimmed in

Ifegl. The first and second stories con-

tain. living and sleeping rooms, sum-

cient to accommodate ﬁfty—inen, while

the -basen'Ient,1c.ontains baths” and

ience of the occupants. ‘
