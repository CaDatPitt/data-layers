O'Connor

announces
guidelines  
for awards

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said, at yesterday’s
Senate Council meeting, that
the guidelines for Pitt’s Public
Service Awards will be
modeled after the existing
Distinguished Teaching
and Distinguished Research
awards.

O’Connor said that five
awardees will receive a $2,000
cash prize and a grant of
$3,000 for support of their
public services contributions.

Student members of the
senate updated the council on
undergraduate, College of
General Studies and graduate
school issues —— including the
controversial plan to award
student government presiden-
tial’ scholarships.

“I would like to say that
Student Government Board
made the decision to endorse
the presidential scholarship,”
SGB President'Gil Golden
said. T

Golden said that this is one
possible way to allow more
students to have the opportu-
nity of being on SGB, since
many students have to work
to pay for college.

Marcie Roberts, CGS Student
Government president, said
that CGS voted and accepted
six credits from the Office of
Student Affairs for the presi-
dential scholarship, but voted
down the six from the Student
Activities Fee.

Graduate and Professional

Student Association President
Steve Parks said that instead
of receiving the presidential
scholarship, GPSA will use the
tuition remunerationto hire
two student activists. Parks
already receives a full scholar-
ship.

Golden updated the council

Reported rape in Tower C

According to the Campus Police, a female student report-
ed that she was raped by a male student two weeks ago in

The reported rape occurred after the female had signed
the male student into her room as an overnight guest. The
report says that at 4 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 6, he woke the
victim and raped her. The student remained in the room for
a few hours after the incident.

The victim, who did not report the rape until this week-
end, wanted the incident reported but no legal action taken.
Campus police are investigating and have identified the
man but could give no further details about the episode.

“We’re going to look into the incident completely for our
own knowledge, so we know what occurred,” Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary Moses said. He noted that the
victim must have resisted somehow in order to file a legiti-
mate rape report but didn’t specify or clarify Public Safety
procedure regarding the incident. .

In a separate incident on Friday night, a female student
was attacked as she was walking on Allequippa Street.

At 11:45  a man pulled up beside the student in a car,
got out and knocked her down. The student, who was
returning from a party, kicked her attacker in the face and

The victim, who was not badly injured, said she didn’t
know the man and didn’t know why he had approached
her. It was not obvious that he was trying to rob or rape

Counseling Center
holds career seminar

0 By Frank Porco

For The Pitt News

For people who are interest-
ed in pursuing a certain career
choice or are going to graduate
school but don’t have the time
to research the schools, the
counseling center is holding a
career seminar this week in the
William Pitt Union.

According to Teddy Fakles, a
counselor at the University
Counseling Center, the career
seminar explores the qualities
that graduate schools and
employers are looking for in a
person.

The seminar brings represen-
tatives from different graduate
schools and professions to Pitt
so students can find informa-
tion on their prospective inter-
ests without spending the time
involved in researching the
schools, Fakles said.

“It is not a job fair; it is to
help undergraduates select
appropriate career direction
and be informed about their

career choices,” she said.

According to Fakles, the sem-
inar is a tremendous resource.
It is also an educational process
for students, so undergraduates
can learn how to prepare for
their future.

“Students would get advice
on how to best use their under-
graduate years as building
blocks for graduate school or a
profession,” said Fakles.

On Tuesday, careers in
Government, Law and Public
Service will be featured.
Careers in Health, Education
and Social Service will be avail-
able on Wednesday. And on

_Friday, information on careers

in Business, Management and
Communications will be avail-
able for students.

The seminar, meant to give
Pitt students a wide variety to
choose from for their future,
has been at Pitt for 20 years.
The University of Pittsburgh
was one of the first schools to

have a career seminar, Fakles

Yeakel campaign worker speaks out about volunteering

By Kelly Casey
and Rebecca Baker
The Pitt News

A campaign worker for Lynn
Yeakel spoke about the impor-
tance of volunteering in this
year’s Senate race at the
Campus Women’s Organization
meeting last night.

Margie Schachter, a Yeakel
campaign coordinator for col-
lege campuses in Western
Pennsylvania, said that students

can play a big part in this
year’s election.

“Youth and college—age stu-
dents play such an important
role in getting people regis-
tered to vote and alerting peo-
ple of the issues in this cam-
paign,” Schachter, a recent
graduate from Emery College in
At1anta,.Georgia, said.

“We hope you plaster Lynn
Yeakel paraphernalia all over
campus,” she said.

Although Yeakel has never

run for office, Schachter said
that Yeakel has ‘‘politics in
experience, not experience in
politics.”

She described Yeakel as a
“public servant in the private
sector” for the past 20 years.
Yeakel was the founder of
Woman’s Way — a
Philadelphia-based, non-profit
organization that provides

social services to women and

allocates funds to abuse shel-
ters, housing and health care

services and clinics.

Yeakel has now become an
advocate for women, children
and families, Schachter said.

Schachter said Yeakel’s cam-
paign, which focuses on
domestic issues, follows the
Clinton-Gore “Rebuild America”
campaign.

Over the summer, thesLeague
of Women Voters in
Pennsylvania randomly chose a
diverse group of nine men and
nine women who were asked

- to name the most important

political topics of the year.

They chose Yeakel’s three
main issues: the economy,
health care and education.

In reference to Yeakel’s
opponent Arlen Specter,
Schachter said, “He has to go.”

Specter wants to portray
Yeakel as a single-issue candi-
date, because at the beginning
of her campaign she stressed
Specter’s role in the Anita Hill

Libertarian student makes move into politics

Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Pitt law student Joe Wahl is
running for state representative
in Wilmington, Delaware
because he says he doesn’t
have a choice.

“I don’t want to have to go

into politics, but I may have to 4

because of what the Democrats
and Republicans are doing with
uncontrollable spending, tax-
ing, regulating and. war-mak-
ing,” Wahl said.

“I: have to run to prevent this
country from sliding from bad
to worse.”

Wahl is running as a
Libertarian, a growing_third
party which wants to take con-
trol of the government so it can
take away the government’s
control.

“The government should stay
out of our bedrooms,” Wahl
says. —

Libertarians believe that the
government has no right to
keep anyone from burning the
flag, doing drugs, getting an
abortion or regulating the econ-

omy.

The only thing the govern-
ment should do, Wahl says, is
“apprehend violent‘ criminals,
uphold constitutional rights and
protect us from foreign
invaders.

“Everything else that govern-
ment does today could be done
more effectively and efficiently
if it was done privately.”

As a state legislator, Wahl
plans to abolish the income tax
which -o he says Delaware
doesn’t need. He also wants to
phase out zoning laws which
lead to political corruption.
“Builders have to bribe the
government in order to build,”
he said.

Wahl is juggling a long-dis-'
tance campaign, three law

9 classes and a talk show that is

aired every Friday from 5 to 6
p.m. on Carnegie Mellon’s
radio station, WRCT—FM (88.3).
In a month he will return home
for a debate against his only
opponent, the incumbent
Republican David Ennis.

Wahl’s political career began
last summer when he realized

that “no matter who won
(Republicans or Democrats)
taxes would increase and the
size of government would con-
tinue to expand at the expense
of our future.”

So he set up tables at local
fairs and went door to door to
spread the philosophy
of Libertarianism, which
believes in keeping social and
economic issues in private
hands. “Surprisingly,” he said,
“support came all across the
spectrum —— black, white,
young and old.”

Libertarianism began in 1972
as a small opposition to the
Vietnam War. At the time, it
was the only political party that
shared the liberal opposition to
the war but favored conserva-
tive economic policies.

Wahl doesn’t look like a
politician. He looks more like a
typical college student — jeans,
baseball cap and book bag. At
24 years old, Wahl just passes
the minimum age limit required
to run for office.

But appearances can be
deceiving, he ‘does sound like a

politician.

“I think he’s been doing a
lousy job,” Wahl said of his
opponent. “He’s part of the
problem, not part of the solu-
tion.”

Wahl first learned about the
Libertarian philosophy from his
older brother John. Soon his
whole family turned from
Republican to Libertarians. Joe

is the first in his family to run _

for office. His brother is his
campaign manager.

Wahl says he isn’t running
for his own advancement. “I
only care about spreading the
Libertarian ideas. The world is
turning toward their ideas.”

A libertarian presidential can-
didate Andre Marou, a legisla-
tor from Alaska, is on the ballot
in all 50 states, Wahl says.

Wahl pointed to his father’s
recent health problems as one
reason for running.

“My father was saved by the
life-saving technology and
innovation which is only possi-
ble in a free or semi-free soci-
ety where science and medi-

“Although Specter has had a

all the good he ever did for

Later in the meeting, CWO

recent publishing of a sexual

Co-president Jennifer

on the SGB’s plan to pass out free Carnegie Museum
passes to the student body.

“We are back and we are working again,” SGB
President Gil Golden said.

Golden said that the SGB has furnished a number of
passes to the Art Department and would be willing to do
the same for any other departments. -

SGB member Jacob Brody addressed the current con-
troversy involving The Pitt News and the publication of a
sexual assault victim’s name.

Brody called for a “thorough review” of The Pitt News
after last T hursday’s publication of the article. He said the
irresponsibility of the paper reflects poorly on the univer-
sity.

Later in the meeting, Golden said that the SGB will be
helping the GPSA by providing more work space for the
Teaching Assistants and Teaching Fellowships in the
Graduate Schools, since it is an issue that does affect
undergraduate students. .

Roberts said that CGS’s Book Exchange Referral
Service, which allows students to purchase and sell used
books, is becoming a successful project. She said that
CGS would like to get SGB and GPSA involved for the
benefits of the university.

“There are over 100 book listings,” Roberts said.

Professor Richard Tobias said that there will be evalua-
tions of all academic administrators and that he would
like to see the promises that are made to new deans be
put in writing.

‘There was a process of evaluation for administrators 10
years ago, but it did not work, Tobias said.

Christina Paulston, professor of linguistics, said that the
stairs in front-of Hillman Library look like a “pig Sty,”
because of all of the cigarette butts.

_ Chancellor O’Connor said that he would have some-
thing put there so the cigarette remains will not clutter
that area.

“If my father had been born in a socialist state
where medicine is rationed, I don’t think he
would be alive today.”

Wahl may be attending a public school, but he
doesn’t believe public schools are the best
places to get an education.

“Eventually we want to get government com-
pletely out of the education business in order to
improve quality.”

Wahl says the free market can make the best
schools. But first the government would have to

etGelePﬂ

help out. '

Anyone who couldn’t afford to go to a private
school would get a $5,000 voucher from the
government, he said. The person could then
take his or her voucher and go to any school —
public or private. Then the free market would
take over.

“Private schools would crop up to compete for
these vouchers, for self interest,” he said.
“Govemment should get out of the way and let

the innovation of the free market provide educa- \

tion, the way it provides shoes, clothing and hi—fi
stereo equipment so Well.”

Last Thursday we ran the name of a sexual
assault victim in a story. This was a mistake. It
is and has never been the policy of The Pz'z‘t
New5'to run the names of sexual assault vic-
tims.

jg First and foremost on this issue, we would

like to make a personal apology to the woman
named. She is the victim, twice over. Nothing
that we can say will make up for what she has

gone, or will go, through but we hope she can-

find it in her heart to forgive us.

To the rest of the university community: We
have made sure that every member of The Pitt
News is aware of this policy and steps are
being taken to make sure‘ that stories like this
one will be checked and rechecked, so that

again.

the university groups who are protesting our

the newspaper is toact as a conscience for the

We hope that this incident will not prevent

Sexual assault is a serious problem in our com-
munity and nationwide. .

The United Nations? Isn’t that
the organization that is sup-

the bright, peaceful days

Nations supposed to bring

Indeed, in the euphoria felt
by political thinkers in the last

looked for the emergence of

the United Nations as the most
powerful force in world affairs.
No longer would world events
be driven by two, superpowers,
or lately, just one. True to its
name, the United Nations
would draw from the resources
of supporting nations to solve
world problems.

Unfortunately, the new tasks
facing the United Nations will
not be met so easily. Today’s
world scene is quite different
from the period following
World War II.

The United Nations was cre-
ated in that atmosphere, with
the Allied Powers holding per-
manent seats on the U.N.
Security Council. The mandate
set forth at that time had the
utmost respect for the individ-
ual sovereignty of countries. If
a country did not ask for U.N.

assistance, the United Nations

would not intervene.

This U.N. policy only exacer-
bates the problems in famine-
stricken Somalia. The African
country has surely had prob-
lems for a long period of time.
There is no food for the peo-

ple, anarchy in the streets, and
essentially no government to
do anything about it. Therefore,
no one could make any request
to the United Nations.

Without having been asked,
U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros—Ghali respected the
sovereignty of Somalia and
refused to offer aid.

He missed the deeper moral
issue at hand.When thousands

Ed
Kichline

are dying everyday because
they are sick and have nothing
to eat, the world is not looking
for the head of such an organi-
zation to stand by the letter of
his mandate.

The United Nations has a
responsibility to save human
lives. The worst precedent he
could set would be to do
something right at the time of
the most need.

What about Yugoslavia? For a
long time, the civil war was a
European matter. The nations
forming the European
Community, another interna-
tional entity looked upon with
promise, worked to implement
over 20 cease-fires, each being
broken.

The fighting continues, and
lately there has been concern
over atrocities against masses
of people. People try to live
without food and medicine.

The United Nations has
entered the situation here, too.
Unfortunately, aid transports
are being shelled en route to
the troubled areas.

So, where has the United
Nations played a worthwhile

role lately? Some would suggest
Iraq. The United Nations con-
demned the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and implemented sanc-
tions to isolate the country.
Later, the Jan. 15, 1991 dead-
line was set by a U.N. resolu-
tion.

Sure, there was a band of
nations united against Iraqi
aggression. Buthow much
would really have happened
without the United States and
its young men and women?
Columnist Charles Kraut-
hammer observes, “What we
have today is pseudomultilater-
alism: a dominant great power
acts essentially alone but,
embarrassed at the idea and
still worshipping at the shrine
of collective security, recruits a
ship here, a brigade there, and
blessings all around to give its
unilateral actions a multilateral
sheen.”

As the power most intact
after the last world war, the
United States took the domi-
nant role in the United Nations.
The time has come for the
United Nations to move
beyond the past and change
the essential nature of the orga-
nization.

The United Nations must
acquire the power to
gain the respect of the world
community. The United States
should remain a vital mem-
ber but should not always
be counted on to be the mus-
cle and the brains of the United
Nations. Now more than ever,
the United Nations must forge
a new, more active and more

successful identity.

Beano Cook blames past administrations for gridiron woes

By Cory Walborn
and George Klimis
The Pitt News

Beano Cook, one of col-
lege football’s most respect-
ed analysts, came to Pitt
Stadium yesterday with one
thing on his mind.

The Pittsburgh native had
finally had enough. He could
no longer stand to see his
alma mater disgraced by an
administration’s past mis-
takes.

So while listening very
intently to Pitt’s weekly
football press conference,
Cook posed a question to
Panther head coach Paul
Hackett: If Hackett was Pitt’s
athletic director ‘and finished
the season with a 4-8 or 5-7
record would he re—hire him-
self?

Hackett’s answer was
“absolutely,” and it only
solidified Cook’s own
feelings. He said that the
hiring of" Ed“ Bozik 10
years ago started a chain

reaction of administration

disasters that has left the
Pitt football program deplet-
ed. »

_“I think a great majority
of the problems [here at
Pitt] resulted from the

ihiring of Ed Bozik,” Cook

said. “And 70 percent; of
the problems now were a
result of the Bozik adminis-
tration. ’

“Bozik was a nine-year dis-

_ Head coach Paul Hackett fielded questions concerning job security from Beano Cook and

other members of the press at his Weekly press conference yesterday.

aster,” Cook said in disgust.
“If the Heinz company would
have had Pitt’s athletic
administration, they would
have been out of business
long ago, and we would
have never-had their 57 vari-
eties.”

‘Cook explained that Pitt,

held a press conference
back, in 1982 to tell the

media of the retirement

of athletic director Cas
Myzlinski and to inform the

' along

press that a search for
a new athletic director was
on. - _
“But the university lied,”
Cook said.

“It was a Charade from the
beginning. I expect politi-
cians to lie, but I don’t
expect the president of the
University of Pittsburgh to
lie,” Cook said.

That rough start, however,
put Bozik in power. Bozik,
with chancellor

Wesley Posvar formed an
administrative team, and they
were now making the deci-
sions concerning Pitt foot-
ball. This administration
bothered Cook and he knew
there would be problems
ahead. I '

Before Bozik was named
athletic director, Cook
knewthat there was what he
called “the right people”
here at Pitt.

He recalled Johnny Majors

and Jackie Sherrill as the
kind ofpeople that could
lead the Panthers in the right
direction.

“Both Majors and Sherrill
were good coaches,” Cook
said.

“Majors saved Pitt football.
If Majors didn't win, Pitt
would have probably
dropped their football pro-
gram altogether.” ’

But Cook knew that
B0zik’s status in the
collegiate sports world
was not equal to that

of Sherrill and Majors. 80
Cook figured Bozik would
not hire a coach of that
stature.

According to Cook, there
should have been other
people given a
to coach Pitt. And there
were some that shouldn’t
have been given a chance at
all. ’

Foge Fazio (Sherrill’s
replacement), Cook says,
seemed to be a perfect match
for Pitt.

“He’s from around here,
he’s ethnic,  but he just
didn’t have it,” Cook said.
“And that’s no sin.”

After the Fazio era, Mike
Gottfried stepped in and was
a winner at Pitt.

“Gottfried was a little para-

'noid, but he was a good

judge of talent and a pretty
‘good coach,” Cook said.

In Gottfried’s first year,

Women's Tennis team

reozdiesfor match at I UP

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The women’s tennis team
will try to make it five in
a row ‘when it travels

to Indiana -University of

Pennsylvania today to take on
the Indians.

Head coach George
Dieffanbach described today’s
contest as a key match for his
team.

“IUP is very competitive
with us, and it should be a
close match,” he said.

“It would be Very nice to
keep the streak going with a
win.”

Pitt and IUP locked horns
last year, with the Lady
Panthbers prevailing in a tight
match, by the final score of 5-
4.

Pitt will again be led by
senior Julie LoPrinzi, who is
undefeated at No. 1 singles
in team competition this
year.

Senior Erika Devins, still
recovering from an aggravat-
ing leg injury, will start
another match at No. 3 sin-
gles.

Taking her place at No. 2
will be first—year player Alison

Baker, who has done well in
Devins’ regular spot.

First-year player Marla

Zielinski is also making a ‘-

profound impact in her first
season at Pitt.

Zielinski is undefeated in
her first four matches of col-
legiate competition.

Coach Dieffanbach will
chose between Andrea
Passarello, Josie Neis-
wenter, Carrie Voda and

Tammy Keister for the
remaining two singles
spots.

Pitt will need all the help it
can get. Historically, the
Panthers have struggled
against this tough
Indian team, and today's
match should be no excep-
tion.

Victories for the Lady
Panthers ‘have already come
against Robert Morris
(7-1), Duquesne (5-4), St.
Francis (9-0) and Canisius (6-
3).

Yesterday’s scheduled
match against the
Youngstown State Lady

Penguins was postponed.
The two teams will play
at the Cost Center on Sept.

First-year Panther Sara Mitchell is part of a rich recruiting
class that is continuing Pitt's tradition of Winning volleyball.

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

Don’t look now, but Sue
Woodstra’s success keeps
breeding more success.

The head coach of the Pitt
volleyball team has ushered in
five first-year players that are
keeping the Panthers winning.
These players seem to be the
key that Pitt needs for what
looks to be a tougher Big East
season.

Jumping aboard Woodstra’s
successful volleyball machine
are defensive specialist Laura
Horvath, middle hitters Sarah
Mikla, Alyssia Yanik and Jennie
Driscoll, as well as outside hit-
ter Sara Mitchell.

Following in the shadows of
six talented players who led
Pitt to four straight Big East
titles is no easy task. These five
new players know this, but will
accept nothing less than
defending a title that has been
cast upon them.

_ “We want to win the Big East
title,” Horvath said. “That is our
team’s goal this year.”

Of the five, the most impres-
sive high school player is out.
Middle hitter Driscoll had
surgery on her right shoulder
and has been redshirted for the
‘92 campaign.

Driscoll received high praise
from across the nation while in
high school and is now going
through rehabilitation for her
shoulder.

“jennie’s a competitor, like
Am [Anne Marie Lucanie],”
Woodstra said. “I’m expecting

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, September 22, 1992

Recruits help to breed furl‘/oer
success in volleyball program

good things from her in the
future.”

While Driscoll remains side-
lined, the other four Panthers
have quietly made significant
contributions to Pitt’s early 4-4
start.

Horvath, a defensive special-
ist, stands only five—foot—three~
inches tall but provides plenty
of excitement despite her small
frame.

“She really picks us up when
we are down,” Woodstra said.
“Laura [Horvath] is a very team-
oriented player who brings all
of the intangibles to a team.”

Serving tough and digging
hard spikes are what Horvath
does best. She is a true team
player whose constant positive
talk on the court has allowed

‘ her to become the “spark plug”

of the team.

“We have to be more consis-
tent as a team,” Horvath said of
Pitt’s shaky early season record.
“If we do, we are bound to get
better.”

Being consistent is what mid-
dle hitter Sarah Mikla is all
about. At 5’11”, Mikla’s height
should help fill the middle hit-
ter void left by the departure of
last seasons co—captains Dee
MacAulay and Sue Zonneville.

“Sarah is a very consistent
and strong player at the net,”
Woodstra said. “She has helped
us a lot at the middle position
so far this season.”

Mikla, a three-sport star in -

high school, has provided a
solid middle attack for the
Panthers, though she is always

looking for improvement.

“I need to improve my block-
ing and arm swing,” Mikla said.
“Really I need to improve
everything.”

Improving is what Alyssia
Yanik would like to do. But
this first-year middle hitter has
been bothered by a sore shoul-
der and has missed some
games throughout Pitt’s last
two matches.

However, Yanik already has
demonstrated her prowess at
the net. She played well in the
Nebraska and Miami (Ohio)
tournaments in the beginning
of the season.

“Alyssia has excellent quick-
ness and jumping ability,”
Woodstra said. “She is going to
be a good player down the
road.”

Another stalwart player
already making her mark on
the Panther squad is outside
hitter Sara Mitchell.

Mitchell, along with Mikla,
has been a starter since the sea-
son began. It is Mitchell’s
repertoire of shots that makes
her harder to defend. This fact
alone explains her early season
starting nod.

“She excels at the finer points
of the game,” Woodstra said.

Pitt’s record of 4-4 is not a
good reflective stat of the
team’s status. “It takes a lot of
getting used to each other [as
teammates] to start to play
well,” Mitchell said of the
Panthers deceiving win/loss
record.

Pitt’s new impact players. Allof
them, minus Driscoll, have
played a considerable amount
of time this season, and so far
the results are impressive.

Mitchell is second on the
team with 62 kills followed by
Mikla’s 55. Middle hitter Yanik
is fifth on the team with 25
kills.

On the defensive side,

3 Mitchell is third on the team
with 56 digs. Mikla is fifth with
47, while Horvath has been
scrapping in the back court for
34.

“I’m very pleased we gelled
well as a group,” Woodstra

lent attitude and is working
hard.”

There is no question to what
this team can accomplish. Take
the first—year players coupled
with two greatly improved
sophomores, Melanie
Gustafson and Chelsea
Hemingway, linked with a solid
setter Annie Mernagh, and
build around an All—American

have a team that could reachits

However, they are still winning

great tight ends they have?

They are great when
Eric Green is there, an
all-too—rare occasion the
last two seasons. He is
hurt, again, and is on
injured reserve until the
Oct. 10 game at Cleveland.
Third-stringer Russ
Campbell is there with
him. Adrian Cooper is a
fine young al1—around tight
end, but he is not the kind
of player who makes up
for a deficiency at wide
receiver the way Green
can. A

Lipps could fill the need
for another dependable
target to go along with
Graham, but he is gone.

So is Everett. All he
has done is start since join-
ing the team as a rookie
fourth—round pick in 1987.
Two years ago he was part
of the best secondary
in football. The Steelers
lead the league in pass
defense despite an anemic
pass rush.

A large part of what they
did was beat receivers up
so badly they could not be
effective. ,They would
catch their passes, but they
would have to pay. Everett
was as good as anybody at
collecting payment.

Now he is a Dallas
Cowboy for the‘ simple

price of a mid-round draft
pick. That really stinks.

The Steelers seem pretty
solid at safety, but they
have some shaky players.
Darren Perry has been
solid as a starter at free
safety, but he is still a
rookie — one who lacks
Everett’s athletic ability.
Back-up Larry Griffin is
solid, but badknees
make his future question-
able. Losing Everett is not
devastating, but it does
hurt.

Why the walking papers
you ask? I think we can
eliminate football reasons.
That leaves the ugly
word that always pops up
in these “cases  money.
Part of it is the usual stuff,
with the players asking for
more money than manage-
ment is willing to pay. The
Steelers have been known
to ditch a guy_ who causes
contract problems. Mike
Merriweather and Franco
Harris are the notable
examples.

It could also be unload-
ing players who could be
total free agents after the
recent court ruling. Everett
could have been gone for
nothing, and they did get a
draft pick.

The issue here is that the
Steelers are not spending
the money necessary to

win. The organization
seems to be heading back
in the right direction. They
are trying to build a team
of quality football players,
not quality athletes who
might become good foot-
ball players. Bill Cowher’s
fiery style is working.

The offensive scheme
of Ron Erhardt seems to
be a perfect fit. Best of all
is the fact that the organi-
zation has the guts to get
rid of players who aren’t
helping the team on the
field.

The trade of 1991 top
draft pick Huey Richardson
proved that.

Cowher continues to
preach the importance of
having the best group of
47 men possible. If the
Steelers don’t spend the
money it takes to pay qual-
ity players, they cannot do
that. In recent years
Pittsburgh has had a low
payroll, and they got what
they paid for —— medioc-
rity.

Now they are in first
place and it sure is nice
there. It would be even
nicer with Lipps and
Everett.

Not to mention easier to
hold on to.

Suspended...

It's too bad that Pitt Played Rutgers last week and not this upcoming weekend.

Yesterday, Rutgers University football head coach Doug Graber suspended five play-
ers including defensive backs Ma1ikJackson(-43 ) and Jay Bellamy (9), both shown
above from last year's game. V .

Reports out of New Brunswick, NJ say that Graber suspendedthe players because
they violated team rules. The other three players suspended were junior Tim Geckler,
sophomore Kareem Williams, and red-shirt freshman Jim Guernera.

Bellamy, a junior, leads Rutgers with two interceptions. Jackson, an All-Big East
selection, had 76 tackles and two interceptions for the Scarlet Knights last year.

Rutgers, who's defense ranked second in the Big East prior to the Pitt game, will visit
Navy this weekend. The lengths of the suspensions were unavailable.

Continued from page 6
year he led Pitt to the
Bluebonnet Bowl and
two years later to the
John Hancock Bowl,
when he was fired just
prior to the bowl game.

Cook said that Gottfried
could have been successful if
he was given more time, but
he wasn’t.

“Posvar wanted him out,”
Cook said, reinforcing his
belief that Pitt’s administra-
tors have made many terrible
mistakes that continually
haunt the Panther football
team to this day.

Cook said that if the firing
of Gottfried was the wrong
decision, that the selection of
Paul Hackett to succeed him
was a huge mistake.

After posting records of 3-
7-1 and 6-5
two seasons and beginning
this year with a disappoint-
ing 1-2 mark, Cook said
his beliefs have become real-
ity.

“He was a good assistant
coach,” Cook said of Hackett.
“But a lot -of people can’t
make that step to head
coach, and Paul Hackett can-
not make that step.”

However, Cook lowers that
blame, not on Hackett, but

on the administration who i

hired him. _

“You better be damn sure
that the guy ‘ who takes
[Gottfried’s] job, better
know what he is doing,”
Cook said.

Hackett’s poor 11-14-1
record, according to Cook, is
an indication that the admin-
istration’s mistakes are shin-
ing through.

Cook said Hackett lacks
three of the major qualifica-

in his first

tions to be a successful col-
lege coach: the ability to
recruit, to prepare his team
and to know what to do on
gameday.

“It seems that [Hackett] is
lost on the day of the game,”
Cook replied.

But when it comes down to
it, Cook blamed the adminis-
tration here at Pitt more so
than any of the coaches over
the past 10 years.

Cook said that the secret to
Pitt’s success lies within the
mistake—prone administration.

With the hiring of both].
Dennis O’Connor as Pitt’s
president and Oval Jaynes as
Pitt’s new athletic director
last year, Cook has held
off a-ny criticism on these
two administrative newcom-
ers.

Although Cook is giving‘

these two a chance to prove
themselves, he is still disap-
pointed about Pitt’s methodi-
cal losing habits.

“It isn’t the losing, but the
way we lose,’’ Cook said,
while voicing his frustration
over the administrative forces
that tend to put their own
agenda’s first and Pitt foot-
ball second.

“If they’re going to com-
pete, they better have the

right coaches [to win],” Cook,

explained.

“I’d like to be proven
wrong,” Cook said. But with
the current trend, Cook said
he thinks nothing will really
change.

“If O’Connor can sit in his

office and not believe that-

there are problems in the
athletic administration, he is
pretty naive for a street-wise
kid from Chicago,” Cook
said.
