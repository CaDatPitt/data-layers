A device eye developed by Dr. Jerome J. Wolken offers
space probers an “eye” to see possible extraterrestial life on
the molecular level. The National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration has pledged $68,000 to.the project for a three

year period.

. Dr. Wolken is ‘a research professor at the University of
Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine and director of the Biophysi-
cal Research Laboratory, Eye and Ear Hospital. —\ .

He developed the device with the assistance of Dr. G. K.
Strother, professor of physics at-the Pennsylvania State Uni-V
" versity, and with Dr. Van der Gon, avisiting research scholar
from Amsterdam, Holland. The Instrument Research Group

laborated.
' A Sensing Box
The “eye” is the sensing box
of a microspectrophometer. About
the size of a walnut, it -sees with
ultra-small ' semi-conducting crys-
tals smaller than a pin-point. It
is sensitive to an area of two
square microns.

The instrument combines the
processes of the microscope,
the spectrophotometer, which-
reveals the elements as colors.
and a recorder. Dr. Wolken, has
miniaturized the combination,
which soon will be suitable as
an instrument in a research
bathyscaph for oceanic investi-
gation and in a rocket satellite
for space probe.

The “eye” can peer at the
working parts inside a livin.g cell,
watch how -a nerve ﬁres, and,
eventually, see whether “life” ex-

lists on other planets. As- Dr.

Wolen I explained, “Life leaves
fundamental footprints—a mole-
cular ring, a tetrapyrrole, called
a porphrin, one of the basic units
of all life in the plant and ani-
mal world.
Essential Molecule

The essential molecule of hemo-

globin of the blood is an iron

Various Avenues

Garﬁnkle explained that the
committee may follow “various
avenues” in utilizing the informa-
tion they collectthis term.iSi_nce
evidences of businessmen discrim-
inating is illegal in the area, he
pointed out, they might hand over
any evidence of this to. the
mayor’s Commission on Human
Relations.

“This way we couldn’t pub- ,

licize our information because
the mayor’s committee would

be investigating this further on -

their own. Some of these places
don’t even realize that they’re
breaking a law.” .
Garﬁnkle touched, on picketin
business concerns but admitted

that it would not be necessary,

since the matter was covered -by
law. “I believe it was the Uni-

versity of Iowa where when, all ' 

beauty and barber shops discrim-
inated, about 500 students picket-

ed and got the concerns to inte-‘

grate. But they had no legal re-
course.” , — -
Publicize Findings

,He explained that the commit- .

tee might also just publicize their
ﬁndings through The , Pitt News
and other sources, “and then per-
haps the mayor’s committee could
pick it up from there.” V 4 
Sincestudent housing of un-
der six living units is not in-

cluded under this law of illegal .

discrimination, the committee
would not report any ﬁndings
here to the mayor’s committee.
“We could talk to these people
who are discriminating,’_’
ﬁnkle declared. “Perhaps I’m an
optimist, but I have faith in ra-
tional argument. This we would

also bring to the administration,

to re-examine the housing list.”
Working to Eliminate

Student Government President
Marty Landy has also been work-
ing to eliminate housing esta-
blishments that have practiced
discrimination from the list of
outside student housing in the
Dean of Men’s ofﬁce.

with the assistance of the Ford

; Foundation, Dr. Stone said that a

major shortcoming of economic

' and social development plans in

under-developed countries is their

i failure to recognize that indus-
: trialization and urbanization are
, two sides of the same coin.

Dr. Sone told the gathering that
"Industrialization cannot t a k e

 place without streets, water sup-
 ply, sewage, electrical power, and
other urban facilities and serv-
. ices. '

And the great masses of
people in all countries flocking
into the cities cannot be put to
industrialization.”

He added that too many under-

 developed nations have failed to
‘ involve their cities in the pla_n-
 ning and implementation of na-

plans,” he said, “nor given ,a suf-
amount of operational
authority or tax powers to.ex_-
ecute projects and services, and
there is a. tendency to centralize
decision—making in national capit-
als.” ' .

Dr. Stone pointed out that most

countries share with the United

States the need to’ create effec-
tive municipal governments and
the means for coordinating the
development ‘of major metropoli-
tan areas. His remarks were based
on ﬁndings during a recent three-
month tour of eighteen cities in
Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Ad [Inc A (Ivancements A

When the latest Ad Hoc committee began its campaign
against discrimination on campus a month ago, it immed-
iately found out that it was dealing with quite a bit more

’~ than it had anticipated.

From contacts we had with the group at that time, it

' was obvious that not very many of the committee members,

had much of an idea just what it was they were trying to
accomplish. True, a petition had been drafted and was
circulated on campus to elicit support forrthe campaign,
however, just how this petition was to be -used to discourage
discrimination was always a little vague.

The committee, however, is now beginning to approach
the matter of discrimination on a more rational and purpose-
ful basis. They have settled down after the ﬁrst burst of wild
enthusiasism and are now trying to evaluate just what it
is-they are up against and what is the best way to oppose it.

Since many people refuse to believe that discrimination

' “exists in any form oncampus, the committee has begun a

thorough investigation of reported instances of bias. It is
collecting statements of individuals supposidly discrimin-
ated against and is then planning to take action once all of
these statements have been evaluated.
It is at his point that the committee is going to run into
difficulty. '

The idea of discrimination in any form is certainly a
hideous thing to contemplate, but there is also a great differ-
ence between establishing the existance of discrimination

' and being able to do something about it.

Irv Garﬁnkle, chairman of the committee, believes that
he can do something, and in some cases he stands a "pretty
good chance. When it comes to those instances which are
illegal according to law, he has the power of the mayor's
Commission on Human Relations behind him. However,
once he begins his campaign against bias on campus he has
nothing behind him except those students and faculty who
sincerely believe that they can make the world a better

' . place to live’ in.

This is admittedly an idealistic outlook on Garﬁnkle’s
part. He also believes that by “rational argument” he can
obtain better conditions in housing for foreign students.
This all hinges on irrational people who discriminate listen-
mg to the rational arguments of a person who wishes them
to stop.

It appears at this time, therefore, that Garﬁnkle is go-
ing to make some headway off camps but that once .on Uni-

_ versity soil he is going to ﬁnd the sailing quite a bit rougher.

- periences.

  Student Complaints

Complaints about poor teaching are a part of
school life everywhere but, last trimester, when I
had a paper’ returned to me, the problem of poor
teaching was brought into sharp ‘focus.

The grade on the paper did not bother me but
I felt that a 3000-word effort de-

comment. ,

“Interesting,” the instructor
had scrawled across the bottom
of the last page._ After class, I
asked him if" a 3000-word paper
didn’t deserve. more comment.
He said. that there were too
many students in the class (over
30) to allow comments on each
paper.

“But how can I learn if I
don’t know what ideas expressed ..in the paper
you feel are right and which ones you feel are
wrong?” I asked, and said that I thought he

should take. the paper back and put some more“

comments on it.
‘ That’s when he called me a trouble-maker.

He reminded me that this wasn’t my first at-
tempt to “make trouble.” Early in the trimester I
had asked a question in class and received an
answer which_, I felt, did not really answer the

to come up to his office after class if I wanted to
discuss the matter further, that he had -no time in

Other students in the class had had similar ex-

mester; hardly any -came after he demonstrated
the inadequacy of his “answers.”

I had begun to feel that this class was useless
after about ﬁve weeks, but that is too late to drop
a class without failing. ,‘

“After the fourth week, withdrawal in a class
will result in an F grade -unless some speciﬁc eac-
tenuating ucircumstances, normally beyond the con-
trol of the student, can be shownto the satisfaction
of the Dean to be the cause of withdrawal..”~ '

The 1963 School "of the Liberal Arts Student
Handbook,_from which the above passage is quoted,
continues by listing as two possible extenuating
circumstances prolonged illness and._a change in
working hours. I would like to suggest some other
extenuating circumstances that often occur. They
center around’ the course material and the person
teaching the course._

The student may ﬁnd the material covered in a
course, or the teacher’s presentation of thematerial
too complex or too simple for him. Also, he may
ﬁnd that the instructor is worthless, for reasons to
be discussed later.

After Four Weeks?

The. University allows students to transfer
courses, drop a course, or ad.d a course during the
ﬁrst two weeks of a trimester. During the second
two weeks of the trimester, studeiits only may drop
courses. After that, asthe Handbookstates, with-
drawal results in an F grade, except under ex-
tenuating circumstances. Is dissatisfaction with a
course extenuating circumstances?

“We think that after four weeks a person should
be able to determine his capacity and his rate of
progress,” the dean of the liberal arts school, Dr.
Albert B. Martin, explained in an interview last
Thursday. T
Reasons Found. Three

Students seem to ﬁnd some teachers "worthless
for three reasons, I suggested to Dr. Martin: They
“lecture” by reading the textbook to the class, or
cover exactly the same material as the text, or
present material which is easily available in atext;
They discourage questions from students by not al-
lowing time for them or by giving inadequate an-

swers; and they return assigned papers with little_

or no written comments.
Dr. Martin said that, although he hears of more

praise for teachers than complaints, he already has_

acted on two or three cases during this academic

- year.

“When I get a complaint, I’ll always investi-
gate,” he said. If he ﬁnds that a student’s. complaint
concerning a teacher is valid, he will “go to the
man, or the chairman of «his department, or the
dean of his division.”

Dr. Martin noted that the response of one stu-
dent to a teacher may be different than that of
another — “We all respond differently to others.”

He did suggest steps which a student who feels
that anteacher is .cfferir_ig inferior instruction may

take. If possible, the student should approach the‘

instructor and talk it over with him.. Perhaps he
feels that he could not do this because of the in-
structoris attitude. Then, Dr. Martin suggested that-
he should confer with his major advisor if he de-

. sires to do so or with either Dr. Martin or Russell

A. Dixon, assistant liberal arts dean.

A problem still remains, however, even if" Dr.
Martin is a‘ble_,to follow through students’ legiti-
mate complaints_ and act upon further evidence.
Students have spent money and time for nothing
or next-to—nothing. Students at some colleges and
instructors at others are working to let students
know what various instructors are like and to let
instructors know how students. are responding to
their courses. Student descriptions of courses and
the teachers who give them, and critiques which
teachers ask students to ﬁll out at the end of a
term will be discussed in this space next’ Monday.

-————Fai|ures, Failures . ::

, his class at term’s'end because he: “just didn’t have

The trimester plan has many failures — failures
readily admitted by the student body; failures

skillfully hidden in hard-sell promotions to pros-
pective freshmen and newspapers.

The trimester, now four years old, is not and
never has been a true twelve-month academic cal-
endar -— a mere measurementof the tickness of
the spring time schedule indicates that equal course
opportunities are not provided in each of the three
terms. Students complain and some faculty mem-
bers candidly admit that many instructors do not
want to teach the April to August term. Other stu-
dents claim they cannot totally grasp and assimi-
late their studies - speed, the watchword of a
twentieth century education, necessitates a “get
it the ﬁrst time or forget it” policy. And time
previously devoted to fraternities, or outside read-
ing or a campu activity is slowly being obliterated.
Would No} Be Foolproof

Yet if all these problems were to be solved to-
morrow, the trimester even then would not ‘be
foolproof. It cannot become a total success until the
so-called “final week” schedule is accepted and
adhered to by the entire University faculty. Some
dissatisﬁed studennts remark they already feel
cheated by the shortened trimester term, and in-
structors admit they have either accelerated their
lectures or omitted large ‘chunks of material. How
many students have heard a professor apologize to

  “Tri-Mess-Ter"

  
 

I By ‘Tom Bryant—'——-J

And now we havelost even moreltime because
of a “final week”. '

In many cases, more than the publicized week
of classes has been eliminated from the end of "a
term. Certain teachers insist upon schediiling exam-
inations for the last class day, ignoring the testing
period set aside by the University. This merely
continues the problem that “ﬁnal week” was sup-
posed to solve:' that of having several ﬁnals on
the same day. Theseteachers, whether seekingan

early start on summer vacation or whatever the ~ ‘

motive, are cheating their students. They are illeg-
ally cutting off another dayiof classes. They are
guaranteeing that some students will receive lower
grades. Instead of several “free”days -for test prep-
aration, students must study for ﬁnal examinations
in two or three classes (all scheduled for the last
class day) while trying to keep up with two or
three other /courses. And additional class sessions
are scheduled at night during the last week of
school — in addition to an early ﬁnal.
Same Chaos

Add these together and the result is the same
old chaos. It cannot be assumed that “final week"
solved all the problems surrounding ﬁnal examina-
tions. It has ‘solved many and could be more effec-
tive is strictly enforced. Yet despite claims of teach-
ers and administrators, the aforementioned situa-
tion can and does exist. Until someone forms an-

‘ LETTERSTO THE

EDITOR

Ad Hoc Committee"
Called Responsible

.Editor, Tlte—Pitt News:

We would like to clarify‘; some
of the fuzzy thinking displayed
by Stan‘ Stein in his article’ cri-
ticizing the Ad Hoc Committee
on Racial Discrimination. This
letter should not be interpreted
as ‘representative of the viewsfof
the committee, but only, as the
opinions of two interested stu-
dents. .

Stan begins by making the
point that rabble-rousers do no
good for either the cause they
espouse or the people with whom
they associate. This is a good
point, but from this point ‘Stan
implies that the committee is
just such a group of rabble-
rousers,

We feel that he is confusing
genuine concern with irrespon-
sible reaction. We are sure that
it has acted in an acceptable and
responsible behavior‘. The fact is
that it has acted in an acceptable
and responsible manner. There
has been no frantic picketing or
soap—box oratory:

Rather, the committee has ask-
ed both student body and faculty
to express their opinions on this
issue. It has done this by re-
questing signatureson a petition
and by requesting statements
from students in responsible
positions and from faculty. We
feel that these activities do not
constitute “reckless righteous-
ness.” '

Stan also stated that since the
advent of the committee, “ten—
sion and animosity” in the Uni-

versity community have increas--

ed. He contends that this ten-
sion is unhealthy. We contend
that tension always accompanies
controversy, and that the solu-
tion of such controversy often-
times justiﬁes the tension gen-
erated.

"This is especially true of
questions involving social prob-
lems, such as those concerned
With discrimination and bigotry.

It seems as if Stan would rather

avoid problems in order to pre-

_.vent '. the tension which . might

accompany them. Such an atti-
tude ‘.7 does 7 not - reflect ‘ .- a mature

  

_ ’/
or reasonable approach to. social

problems. If the goal of. society
were constantly to avoid tension
by suppressing controversy, in
the process, society would also
suppress progress. In conclusion,
we hope we have shown that
the committee is neither irre-
sponsible in its orientation nor
reckless in its policy.

Editor's ‘In-fanti|ism'

. Student Attack Basis

Open letter‘ to Mr. Stan Stein;
Dear Mr. Stein:_

First allow me tostate that I
am not a member of the Ad Hoc
Committee, nor am -I a member
of the Mayor’s committee. I say
this so that you will not arrive

' at the conclusion that I am at-

tacking your views.for the pur-

‘pose of retaliation. I am, how-
‘ever, one of those people whom

you refer to as “Maggot-Dig-
gers” — one of those people who

ﬁght for a cause. If ﬁghting for.
freedom,

equality, if loving
freedom, justice equality and

fair play makes me ‘recklessly V

righteous” then so be it, for‘ this
I am. ’ -

Let me remind you, sir, that

if there were no animosities, no .

ill-feelings, no prejudices at this
University, no amount of dis-
cussion on the matter would

causethem to take form. If, on ,

the other hand, they are present
they should and will be attack-
ed in the open. . '

You stated that before the ad-
vent of the ‘Ad Hoc/ Committee
there was little thought,.given to
the possibility of racial or reli-
gious bias. Perhaps there was
little thought of it, but the fact

v remains that they did exist. You
seem to advocate the policy of

ignoring a bad thing ' and per-
haps it will-go away or people
won’t notice it. Perhaps you’re
right, perhaps they won’t notice
a dead horse in the living room.

The University, although it
has taken some measures, has
not done all that it could do. .
You  that the ‘Ad.:‘Ho

    

Committee .on Racial Discrimi-
nation was a small, recklessly‘
oriented group‘. I’m sure the ma-
jority of people will agree‘ that

‘they , cted in a more ‘commend-

able manner. , ,

It sems that you would have
us overlook discriminatory prac-
tices because they generate ten-
sion. You also state that the Uni-
versity cannot afford to offend
many “Influential” people in the

city. I wonder, sir, would you‘

advocate not teaching truth be-
cause it offends influential peo-
ple. I was under the impression
that the purpose of the Univer-
sity was to teach and not to’ap-
pease influential people.

. You further stated that the
“Maggot-'
. Diggers” ﬁght is not clear in our

ideal for which we

own minds. Really, sir,’ can you

 

Who says Oxford cloth has to be heavy ‘.7

really believe such an infantile
statement? 'The ideal for which
I ﬁght is equality, justice, truth
and fair play for all people of ~
all races, of all religions.

Let me say that I bear you
no ill feelings. I am merely con-
cerned that a college student can
employ such ‘immature logic.

Allow me to suggest, sir, that
when nextwyou feel the urge to
write, sit down and_ think, then
investigate the issue upon which
you’re writing. I’m sure then you
will ﬁnd a more mature way of
expressing y o u r s e l f without
ﬁnding it necessary to resort to
name-calling. We, the “Maggot-
Diggers” wish ‘you a speedy re-
covery from your- attack of ‘in-
fantilism.” I

Life in outer space may possi-

Thus Dr. Wolken is ﬁrstly in-
terested in how a living organ-
ism translates one form to an-
other. Speciﬁcally, how the eye
transforms light energy into light,
and how the blood cell performs
syntheses. He is studying how
living organisms have evolved
through their receptors. He is
probing into the chemical changes
within‘ the living cell, focusing
on the enegy system at the mole-
cular level.

Cell Traps Energy
Via spectral shifts, the instru-
ment records chemical changes
which occur when a living cell
traps energy for its own use.
This is signiﬁcant, because
the ' same process of energy
transfer occurs in all systems,
whether in the oxidation of fuel
within the animal cell, in a leaf
carrying a photosynthesis, or
when a one-celled animal con-

high sensitivity of the retinal ‘T
rods and cones makes them a
desirable target for study.

Open New Doors

“Also, with the answers to some
of these basic questions, scientists
could build model systems hav-
ing the behavior of living calls.
Understanding the workings of
the compound eyes of insects
could open new ‘doors_ in naviga-
tion,” he explained.

It is remote, according to Dr.
Wolken, to think ahead to the
day when a mechanical scan-
ning eye will be able to guide
itself or when the blind can be
provided w i t h navigational
eyes.

“The major problems in biol-
ogy are energy transfer systems,
photoreception, nervous conduc-
tion, and brain integration. We
want to know how energy gets
shoved around. To unwrap “the
mysteries of nature’s processes,
we have to study them while they
are happening.”

Engineering Prof Gears
For Switzerland Meeting

Dr. C. C. Li, associate profes-

present a paper, “Integral Pulse

Systems,” at an international
meeting in Basle, Switzerland in
August. '

The paper, written with R. W.
Jones, chairman of the Biomedical
Engineering Research Center of
Northwestern University, de-
scribes an electronic control sys-
tem derived from the study of
nerve communication in physio-
logical control systems.

When it came to legal dis-
putes, two law student fared
somewhat better than the
Student Parking Petition
Committee.

Norman W. Smith Jr. and

Leonard J. Bucki, were not
awarded the jury’s verdict in the
ﬁnal round of Moot Court com-
petition. Smith and Bucki did,
however, each receive cash awards
of $150 for being among the four
finalists in the Moot Court com-
petition sponsored by The Acad-

‘ emy of Trial Lawyers of Alle-

gheny County and KDKA radio.
Consisted of Series
The trial competition consisted
of a series of preliminary trals
held earlier this year and ‘a ﬁnal
trial on April 30. Students par-
ticipating also came from the
Duquesne University Law School.
Chief Judge Wallace S-. Gour-
ley of the Federal Court for the
Western District of Pennsyl-
vania presided over the com-
petition which was named in
honor of him. Judge Gourley
awarded ﬁrst prize money of
$3.50 to Duquesne students Giles
J. Gaca and Plaon N. Mandross
who handled the case for the
defense. ' ‘
V An “incident” staged outside
the Gateway Center” studios of
KDKA provided the basis for the

civil law suit which was con-
tested in the ﬁnal round of Moot
Court competition.

Injured Passerby

Under the supervision of John
Kulamer, public service director
of KDKA, an “inocent passerby”
was suposedly injured in a rob-
bery and sued the guard and the
messenger who were robed, stat-
ing that his injury was their
fault.

The University students han-

dled the case for the plaintiff,
(the injured passerby), while
Duquesne handled the case for
the defense, a fictitious engi-
neering ﬁrm employing the
guard and the messenger.

KDKA personalities Art Pallen,
Clark Race, Kurt Russel, and stu-
dents from Mt. Mercy College

were witnesses and were called

upon to testify.
Favorable Comments

Jim Westover of KDKA de-
scribed the proceeding for the ra-
dio audience. Judge Ruggerio
Aldisert, who had presided over
the earlier rounds of competition,
joined Westover to describe the
proceedings. Judge Aldisert made
favorable comments on the actions
of both the coun.sel for the plain-
tiff and the defense.

President Harold R. Smith
and members of the Academy
of Trial Lawyers have ex-

/

‘Law Students Plea Earns $150

pressed their interest in reliev-
ing the acute shortage of trial
lawyers in the Allegheny Coun-
ty area.

Presently the courts of Alle-
gheny County do not have more
than 100 trial lawyers available
to handle the heavy caseloads.

Thomas M. Cooley II, Law
School dean, and Dean T. F.

Quinn of Duquesne cooperated in -

the educational program and At-
torney Paul T. McArdle coordi-
nated the trial set-up with KDKA
radio.

The aims of the Moot Court
project are to provide the public
with a better understanding of
the law and to further interest
in trial law among law students.‘
The many men involved in the
project considered the Moot Court
trials a favorable success and are»
thinking of making the [competi-
tion a yearly event.

With new attacks on the
Supreme Court now making
headway in the state legisla-
tures, the bar and the univer-

couraging public understand-
ing of the Courts purposes and
performances, Harvard Law Pro-
fessor Paul A. Freund told an
audience of 300 here on April 29.
The address was part of the Law

Law-Day. _
Unless these dispassionate de-
fenders of the Court become vocal

show the maturity to “judge their
judges rationally,” our whole
system of constitutional govern-
ment could break down, he warn-
ed.

.- The current threat — three pro-
posed constitutional amendments
which already have passed a num-

sent a return to the spirit of local-

inal law enforcement, reappor-
tionment, and the New York
‘school prayer case, Prof. Freund
pointed out.

Perpetuate Influence ‘

The amendments, he said, were
designed to perpetuate the influ-

ence of current members of state

legislatures and to curb the Court.
‘The amendments could ac-
complish this by establishing 'a
“supreme court of the states”
made up of the 50 state chief
justices, with authority to de-
’ cide any case involving on al- ‘
leged infringement of states’
. rights. - .
They would also, remove the is-
sue_of state reapportionment from
the federal courts and from the
equal protection. guarantee of the
US: Constitution; and would set
tip a ‘new procedure for amend-
ing the Constitution, by-passing
Congress entirely.
Great Problem

A great problem," Freund em- M

phasized, is that while rural in-

terests, segregationists, important
church groups, and law enforce- '

.ment.»oi’ﬂcials ‘in the states- are
uniting against the Court, the
countervailing . interests are not
nearly so distinct and organized.
The Courts survival in the
face of 170 years of repeated at-
tack has been due primarily,
Freund asserted, to public un-
derstanding of its role and
mission. Three of its functions,
he said, may explain many_ of
the recent controversies over
the Court's authority.
These are its responsibility to
maintain the_ constitutional dis-
tribution and limits of power; its
mision to maintain a market of

continental extent against state

barriers; and its role in preserving
an open society whose government
is both responsive and responsible.
Realm of ‘Procedure

In the realm of procedure,
where the Court has recently be-
come increasingly insistent, the
Justices should be seen, Freund
said, as “the special guardians of

- the standards of decency and fair

play that must be the counterpoise
to the extensive affirmative pow-
ers of government:
“It is not hard to appreciate
the central importance of de-

— cisions on freedom of assembly,

on voting rights, and on reap-
portionment,” Freund continu-
ed.

“The real question is whether
the Court has been too doctrin-
aire in resolving specific issues of
this ‘kind. Although there has
been rapid and highly signiﬁcant
movement in constitutional doc-
trine, it has not come as suddenly
or as drastically as the more vehe-
ment critics assert. A

Authority Not Denied
’*"‘Legislative investigating com-
mittees have not been denied the

sociations of a witness; they must
however establish the pertinence
of those ' associations and show
probable cause that they have in-
volved illegal or subsersive ac-
tivities.

“The reapportionment case
has not laid down a simplistic
rule whereby all legislative dis-
tricts must be based on popula-
tion The public schools
have, to be sure, been ‘forbid-
den to install prayers even of a
diluted sort, but the alternative
would have been to put the
Court in the business of picking
and choosing among prayers
and thus compounding the in-
trusion of ,the secular into the
religious sphere. '

“Moreover, the Regents Prayer
decision does not prevent the pub-
lic schools from engaging in moral
education; they are prevented
only from doing it in a way that
puts psychological constraint on
religious. minorities in’ the coer-
cive atmosphere of the school
room." '

Door Not Closed"
’ Freund pointed out that when

     
 

Daily Calendar

the Court invalidates a law or
decision on grounds of improper
procedure, the door is not closed
to dealing with the issue involv-
ed. The Government is simply
“forced to turn squarer corners,”
he said.

Hepredicted that the future
is not likely to bring lessening
in government intervention in
business and social concerns.

“As science advances into inner

and outer space — the far reaches
of our galaxy and the inner re-
cesses of the mind‘— as physical
constitutions,” he concluded, “we
have reason to be thankful that
some limits are set by our legal
Constitution.”

Sage Remarks

By Bob Smizik

Sports Editor

 

A week, Coach Bobby Lewis isn’t nearly as worried about those

' licka at third until Supansic is ready to return. The coach

 

.with Duquesne. They now stand

_ they beat St. Vincent. They lost

 

Although the baseball team had two narrow wins last

games as he is about the two that his team didn’t play.’

Lewis’ crew was rained out of a Tuesday game with In-
diana State and was snowed out of a Wednesday encounter
with Clarion State.

“These rainouts could prove costly to us. The less games
we play, the less we can afford to lose. Some of those western
schools like Arizona and Southern Cal can afford to ‘lose
seven or eight games and still make the NCAA playoffs, be-
cause they play a forty of ﬁfty game schedule.

“That doesn’t apply to us. We only play a little over 20
games and if we lose four or ﬁve games our chances are
greatly hurt.” .

’ Lewis is plainly worried. He thinks his team is the best
in the district but fears they might not make the playoffs due
to an inadequate schedule. ' -

The schedule, however, isn’t Lewis’ only worry. A col-
lection of sore arms and burn knees could prove very trouble-
some to the team this week. ..

Martha Goes First - _

It all began when Paul Martha, the team’s third baseman,
developed a sore arm on the Southern trip. I-I_e sat ‘out the last
two games of the trip with Jim Yedhcka tak1ng_h1s place.

Martha had to be rushed back into the lineup last week
when second baseman Ron Supansic developed a sore arm.
This wasn’t too bad until .Yedlicka’s chronic bad knee got
worse. ‘He has trouble just movingaround. A

Lewis has no other reserves in the inﬁeld, but could
bring Corky Cuthbert, a former second-baseman, back in
to the inﬁeld from his right ﬁeld spot. This would be
taking a risk though, since Cuthbert also has a bad knee
and the chances of hurting it are far greater in the inﬁeld
than in the outfield. ~

Lewis has no choice but to stick with a hobbling Yed-

doesn’t know when that will be either.

1 l The team, according to Lewis, needs Supansic in the line-
up. “We weren’t the same without him in there,” the coach
said. “Not only are we better offensively and defensively
when he’s playing, but he’s the kind of player that makes a
team go.” _

Others Have Trouble
Lewis’ troubles are insigniﬁcant compared to those of
tennis coach Ben Pope and golf mentor George Underwood.

The tennis team lost its sixth straight of the season _on
Saturday and the golfers lost their seventh in eight tries
over the weekend. They have one tie.

The pity of the matter is the type of schools these
teams are losing to. In many cases their enrollment is
smaller than Pitt’s. More important than that is that Pitt
gives scholarships in these sports, while,many of the
schools they are losing to, especially the local schools, do
not.

It seems a waste of money and effort to send these teams
on away trips. Both of them make brief tours of the South
during the between trimester break and the golfers spent
last weekend in Maryland.

There does not seem to be any justification for these
teams, especially the golfers, who have not won since 1961, to
make such trips at such expense.

Golfers Lose Three Matches;

Team Winless in Last 18 Tries

The Panther golf team contin-
ued on its losing way last week-
end by dropping three more
matches. The linksmen were
downed by Georgetown, 51/2-11/3,
Friday and on Saturday lost to
Maryland and Navy by 6-0 scores.

Thus the team’s record is “mar-
red” only by a tie last Tuesday

Abarey won his match over.
Tom Graham, 4-3, to pick up a
point and Faust tied George
Baldwin to net at half of a
point. .

The Georgetown match turned
out to be the highlight of the trip
as far as point scoring was con-
cerned. No Panther managed to
win a match against Maryland or
Navy. Phil Fassett had the team’s
best score — an 81 -- but that
was not good enough to win.-

Maryland’s Bernard N ovak,
playing on his home course, had
the best round of the day, a
blistering 69. Novak’s round was
good enough to beat the Panther’s
number, one man, Neil Shorthouse,
7 and 6.‘ The golfers have an away
match with Ohio University
scheduled for Saturday.

0-7-1 for the season.

The last time the golfers won a
match was May 22, 1961 when

one more match that year, lost
ten last year and have dropped
seven this year. Including the tie
with Duquesne, the golf team has
not won in its last 19 outings.
"Against Georgetown Phil
Abaray and Phil Faust got the‘
only points for the team.

Unbeaten Panthers Seek 10th .Win;

Dave Sauer Scheduled

By IVIARV ZELKOVVITZ

To Pitch

The Panther baseball team seeks its tenth consecutive victory today, when they
meet Allegheny College at Leech Farm. Dave Sauer will pitch for Bobby Lewis’s team

against junior lefthander Jim Marquis.

Marquis’s specialty is slow curves. He pitched both ‘games against the Panthers last
year, stopping them at Forbes Field, 5-3, and losing at Meadville, giving up nine runs in one

and one third innings.

Track Team Triumphs

Over Two Opponents

' Joe Friend’s return to the Panther track lineup as a full
time performer was just enough for the track team toscore a
convincing win over Syracuse and West Virginia in a triangu-
lar track meet Saturday at the Stadium. The Panthers scored
69 points to 54 and 39 for Syracuse and West Virginia, re-
spectively. ‘ _ “V

Friend racked up two ﬁrsts and
a second for thirteen points. Run-
ning in his ﬁrst outdoor meet of
the season, Friend broke the sta-
dium record in th 440—yard low
hurdles, with '  ' 
55.1 time, soar
ed to 22—feet in
the broad jump
and eased to .a
second in th
120—ya_rd h i g h
hurdles.

the Panthers.
Bill Del, Vecchio won the 220-

Vecchio came from behind to edge
Charles Gaston. It was the other
way around in the 100-yard dash

where Gaston nipped Del Vecchio
in 9.8.

 

 

Pulls Muscle
Vance Carter won the 440-yard
dash with a time of 48.1," even
though he pulled a muscle going
around the last bend of the race.

Syracuse’s touted distance
man, Mouncey Ferguson, of Mt.
Lebanon, lived up to his billing
by winning the half mile and
mile runs. He ran a 4:19.2 in
the mile and a 1:58 in the half
mile to give Syracuse its only
ﬁrsts of the day. Larry Robin-
son was fourth in the mile for
Pitt.

The Panthers picked up some
points in the javelin when Mort
Stanfield took a third place.

for the Panthers, but Coach Carl
Rees did not use his regular run-
ners to avoid the risk of any in-
jury since, Pitt had the meet
clinched. ’

and Al Thomassey also took two
firsts.

Whiteford won the high jump
with a leap of six-feet and edged
Friend in the high hurdles.
Thomassey won the discus and
shot put.

Four Other Winners
The Panthers also took ﬁrsts in
the pole vault, two-mile run and
the 100 and 440—yard dashes.

Ron Weirs won the pole vault
with a jump of 13-feet 6-inches.
Teammate Gary Meckley was
second. John Bailey ran his best
two mile of the year in the win-
ning time of 9:49.1, even though
he had no serious competition.

   

Ralph Basinski ‘was fourth for .

“That kid can be tough,”’Lewis‘
said. “If we go up to the game

 trying to clobber him, he’ll be
5 tough. The only'way to beat a

‘junkballer’ is to slap the ball.”

I Blackwood was an all Presidents’

 third base last year, batting .378.

Seedyke batted .333 last year,‘
and was instrumental in Alle-

ture of the PAC baseball title.

The Panthers and the Gators
have one common opponent this
year, Slippery Bock. Allegheny
won their game 7-6 in ten inn-
ings, while the Panthers eeked out

a 3-2 decision for their eighth win,
last Thursday.

Straight Fast Ball

John Carlisle struck out 17

<men in the ball game, giving up
: ﬁve hits. “They hit some pretty
_ good shots against John,” Lewis

said.‘ “His fastball wasn’t moving,
it just came straight in.” ’

“-701111 ‘really had poise out
there,” Lewis said. “In the ninth
inning he put the first man on
base. _The- next man up laid.
_ .down a beautiful * bunt. Most,
‘ pitchers would have taken the
sure play at ﬁrst base, but Carl-
isle has it here.” The coach pat-
ted his stomach. , ~

“He came off the mound like ‘a
cat, and ﬁred to second base,
Where he got the hefd runner.
That play saved the game.”

Use Five Pitchers
The Panthers won their ninth
game on Friday, edging West-
minster, 6-5, as Lewis used ﬁve’

two and one third innings,’ Start-
mg pitcher Jim Sylvis went one
and two thirds innings, giving up
all ﬁve runs.’ . -

Catcher Mike Supsura drove
in one run in the fourth inning,»
on a single and a triple, nar-
nowing the margin to 5-2.

Then,‘in the sixth inning, Fred
Mazurek, who had a three for

home run. Mazurek’s home run,
his third, gave relief pitcher Roger
Johnson, who only pitched one
inning, the victory.

Lewis was disappointed with his
team’s showing this week, but ex-

day to be_sharp. A layoﬁ hurts a
batter’s timing and a pitcher’s
control. We’ll pick up now.”

Paul Martha played second
base, and Jim Yedlicka played
third in both games last week,
Martha’s sore shoulder resulted
in his‘ shift to second, benching
the sore-armed Ron Supansic.

Season Ticket ‘
Plan Includes
Whole Family

Athletic Director Frank Carver
has announced a new football
season ticket plan that will appeal
to the entire family.

The tickets will be in section
nine and will cost $13 for adults.
Children of high school age or
under, who are accompanying one
or both parents, can buy a season’s
pass for ﬁve dollars.

Carver said, “We have done a
poor job in trying to sell tickets
to the entire family. I realize how
expensive it is for a young couple
to buy two season tickets and
then pay for a babysitter every
Saturday afternoon. In this plan,
a‘ family will spend ﬁve dollars
for a season ticket for each child.

“If we can get youngsters to
become Pitt fans,” Carver con-
tinued, “when _they become
adults we hope they will re-
main Pitt fans. This is a step in

- ‘ that direction.”

.Orders for season tickets and
individual tickets for all games,
home and away, can be placed
with the Athletic Department, U.
0. Box 7436. ' ~

This year the Panthers‘ play
home games with "Washington,
California, Syracuse, Army and
Penn State. They are on the road
to Notre_ Dame, UCLA, Navy,
West Virginia and Miami. _Miami
will replace Penn State in the
traditional last game of the year.
The away game with West Vir-
ginia will be on regional televi-
sion.

A track man usually can be

_ distinguished by his long legs _

andrwiry frame. Mike Slutsky,
sprinter and relay man for 
the Panther track team, has 

none of these features.

His legs are short and muscular '

and his height is diminutive

Slutsky’s big trouble is that he is .
too muscular. Watching him run 
one has to be amazed at the speed 5
he is able to move his thick :

stumps.

Coach Carl Rees says Slutsky is I

one of his best sprinters and this
is a great tribute to Slutsky be-
cause after every race his muscle

' cramp up so badly that he is hard-

ly able to walk. It is not unusual
to see him throw up after a meet.

Better at 220

The 220- 440-yard dashes are
Mike's specialty, however. In the

A , Army meet Coach Rees tried "him

in the 100-yard dash. Slutsky
ﬁnished far behind the leaders be-
cause he couldn’t move his legs
fast enough in the short distance.

His short stride, however,
doesn’t hamper him in the long-
.er spirits. His stride is not pic-
turesque, but he seems to bull
and strain just a little longer

In the West Penn Federation
meet held at the Fitzgerald Field
House he won both the 220 and
440-yard dashes in ﬁne times. But

wins were the way he kept his
galloping pace and edged out his
opponents in last second efforts.

As with other great athletes
Slutsky has great competitive
spirit. In the Army meet he threw
the javelin, ran the 100- and
220-yard dashes, but suffered a
slight cramp which frequently oc-
curs in his legs.

Rees decided not to let him run
in the mile relay, so as not to en-
danger his leg. Slutsky complain-
ed and was even more upset when
the team lost. He was not only
angry at the teams losing but also
at himself for not being able to

the mile and the 440-yard dish. 6

Woodruff later went on to com-
pete in the Olympics as did two
other record holders, Ernie Sowell
and Herb Douglas.

Kanell, the owner of the Pitt
shot put record, holds the Stad-

In a day when track records are
broken almost daily it is surpris-
ing and disheartening to note that
the last time a Panther running
record was broken was in 1955,
when Sowell set the half m 1e

 Fred Mazurek Always Seeks to Improve

Not Satisfied with

Excellence

By MARV ZELKOWITZ

Fred Mazurek, s t a r t i n g
Panther centerﬁelder, is an
exception to the rule of Uni-

. versity athletes. The ﬁve—foot-

ten-inch sophomore is never

> satisﬁed with his performance.

He always feels he can do better.

Against Syracuse, he went three
for seven- and had four runs bat-
ted in. He. had a bases loaded
single in each game, and stole two

bases. His single in the second.

game accounted for the Panthers’

_ _only runs in the 2-1 contest.

“I don’t consider that hitting,”
he said after the games. “Wait till
we go South on that road trip.
I’ll really hit down there.”

Predicts Well

Mazurek was a" prophet. On the
ﬁve game road trip, he collected

11 hits in 24‘at bats for a .457.

average. He also hit,‘ two home
runs, two doubles, drove'in ﬁve
runs, and scored ten.

Mazurek, who had a .450 bat-’
ting ' average after seven
games, still is no complacent.

]If ‘I go three for three in our’
next game, I’ll be batting .500.”
‘The centerﬁelder has the same

attitude about his defensive play,‘
although his baseball coach, _Bob-

by Lewis, does not share Maz- .

urek’s sentiments. “He made ‘a
couple of stops in the Syracuse
games that cut off doubles and
triples. I don’t think anyone could
have caught" those balls, and very
few center ﬂelders would have
cut them off.”

Mazurek disagreed. “Those balls
could have been caught,” he said.

Wanted Education

—Professional‘ baseball eyes have
been- on Mazurek since "high
school. The "Philadelphia Phillies
offered Mazur_ek. $25,000 dollars
to don a uniform in their farm
system, but he declined. “That’s

’ During Last Week

The Panther baseball team was - -

rained’ out "of two games last‘
week. The Panthers home game
against Indiana State at Leech
Farm last Tuesday was called due
to wet grounds. The ﬁeld had not
dried sufficiently from the pre-
vious day’s rain to permit play.
Wednesday’s game at Slippery
Rock was called due to snow. Ac-

cording to Coach .Bobby Lewis. ‘

there. were three -inches of snow
at Slippery Rock. '

.The games were the" first two-
rain—outs of the year for the
mitters. In the past rain has al-
ways been a problem for Lewis’
teams. , . ‘
-Two years‘ ago the team’ was
forced to postpone almost half of
its games due to’ inclement
weather.

could play it all year round and
not get tired of it.”

Arm Went Dead

The outﬁelder started out in
baseball as a pitcher and catcher
in the Pony League. “I would
probably still be a catcher,” he
said, “but my arm went dead. I
can’t snap that throw from_ home
to second base. One week I pitch-
ed a game, then caught 14 innings,
and then pitched again.

_ “After that, my arm ‘got

sore,” he continued. “Then it
went dead. I was fast, so they

put me in the outﬁeld. I’ve'been
there ever since.”

fleet-footedness. “Don’t ever ‘let
anyone .tell you that people who
walk ‘with their toes out aren't
fast runners. Mazurek walks that
way, and he can fly.”

Father Comes

‘Mazurek’s father can’t see him
as well in the outﬁeld, but he
comes to the games just the same.
“I feelpal lot better when my folks
are at a ball’ game. It’s more fun
playing, and I feel like I really
have to do well. My folks were at
the Notre Dame game this year.”
It was in that game that Mazurek
took a’ kickoff on his own six-
yard line,,and raced 94 yards for
a touchdown.

Mazurek participates in two
sports here, and starred in three
sports in high school. Besides
playing baseball, he stood out in
football and basketball. He
played quarterback for .Red-
tstone High school, where he
was a high school All-Ameri-
can, rushing for over 1,000"
wards in nine games. He also
averaged 26 points a game in
basketball.

Because of his prowess in these
sports, Mazurek was offered ath-
letic scholarships by over sixty
colleges and universities. .

Despite this being his rookie
season on the baseball team, Ma-
zurek felt almost completely at
ease when trying out for the team.
“Actually, I knew a lot of the
guys from school, and I knew
some guys from the football team.
Bill Bodle and Paul Martha both
played ball_with me this fall.”

The new addition to the Pan-
ther outﬁeld has changed the trio
to an offensive-asset rather than
deﬁcit. Last year, the outﬁelders
batted a composite .211, amassing
34 hits. This ‘year, the starting
outﬁelders have 40 hits in 93 at
bats for a .430 batting average.

History Called

 

 

i ‘ Lasting Tribute

By MATTHEW SWETONIC
It is fast becoming a pop-

ular theory among contem-

porary historians that the
best method of expressing the
brutality of modern warfare

is through the actions of the

commonist characters involved—-

. the ordinary footsoldier, or in the

case of Robert Leckie’s history,
Strong Men Armed (Random
House, 563 pages, $7.95), the

7 United States Marines.

If Leckie has written a history
of the amphibious war against
Japanduring the last war then
he has also produced a lasting
biographical tribute to the,“strong
men” who gained victory in the
Pacific.”

His work is evenly balanced in
its presentation. He not only fol-
lows the logical order of historic
events but he also manages to

« provide the reader with that feel-

ing of terror and anguish that
was so much a part of the great
oceanic war.
Livens It Up

Although he possibly occupies
too much space with the six
months struggle for Guadalcanal
in 1942, he livens up his treat-
ment of that segment of the book
by the constant interspersion of
minor occurances that were not
a part of the main drama unfold-
ing on the island.

These segments of the book
relate incidents in the lives of
the Marine flyers who protecte-
ed the air above the island are
perhaps the most dramatic epi-
sodes in the entire book; how-
ever, outside of the mere im-
pact of their heroism, they do
little to heighten the reader’s
understanding of the purely his-

torical implications of those
events. '

‘Strong Men Armed’ - ‘Fail Safe’

z

And this is perhaps the chief
attribute of the work. The strong
men armed are just that; they are

men who have lived through the
most trying times in history and
by their individual endeavors they
have achieved their nation’s ob-
jectives.
Wrestled Control

The book is the story of the
men who made "up the Marine
Corps; not the Corps as a separate
entity in itself but the living,
bleeding, and dying men who
wrested control of the Paciﬁc
from the hands of the Japanese
Empire.

It is the story of Colonel
David Shoup who singlehand-
edly kept separated and batter-
ed Marines together during the
first two days on bloody Tara-
wa. It is also the story of Tony
Stein who stood off a hundred
screaming Japanese with a
machine-gun torn from a
wrecked Navy fighter plane.

But it is not only the story of
heroes. Lieutenant Henry Morgan
was not a hero adrift in a sinking
amphibious _tank off Iwo Jima, but
his story is included also.

Strong Men Armed is not the
story of a great war; but it is
the story of the men who went
into that war —— of the men who
came back, of those who came
back maimed, and of those men
who did not come back at ‘all. It
is the history of those men_ call-

ed Marines set against a back-
ground of the islands they con-
quered and the honors they earn-
ed, and it is excellent.

Lost Pace Maims

Vivid Adventure
By SVIJAY JAIN

Eugene Burdick and Har-
vey Wheeler in Fail. Safe
(McGraw-Hill . Book Com-
pany, 286 pages, $4.95) have
attacked the defense system
of United States, just as they
attacked the diplomatic corps in
their The Ugly American.

The book, based upon a short
story, “Abraham ’58,” by Harvey
Wheeler, makes an exciting and
interesting start with the failure
of the fail-safe mechanism and
the launching of six vindicators
against Russia, their» destination
Moscow. '

From there, however, the ad-
venture sags and the reader too
often is subjected explanations of
the political thoughtof the var-
ious characters and their reactions
to the news of an impending nu-
clear war. Although the two poli-
tical science professors are amply
qualified to expound upon such
topics, they don’t chose the right
time and place to do it.

New Englander

Characterization of the presi-

dent of the United States and
Premier Khrushchev seem /way
out of line from the common be-
liefs. The president has a dis-

tinguishing New England accent,

the reader is told, but no such
dialogue is recorded. Khrushchev
is shown less belligerent almost
afraid, caught in a situation he
would rather. not be in.
The order given by the Pres-
.ident to have the vindicators
—-chased and destroyed by US.
bombers, making available top
sec_ret information ‘to Soviets so
that they may destroy the vin-
dicators, and the last decision
to order the Air Force to bomb
for the bombing of Moscow do
provide exciting moments for
the reader.

The climax, where General
B 1 a c k commits suicide after
bombing New ‘York city, where
his family is among other destroy-
ed, including the president’s wife,
is an expected but effective cli-
max to the novel.‘ *

Deep Study

The description of various de-
fense apparatus, the mechanism
of the fail—safe procedure, and
the top level conference shows
through understanding and deep
study of the subject irmatter and
gives credence to the whole theme
ofthe book. A

The attempt to display their
absolute mastery of the subject
has led the authors to write

more than necessary for the
purpose of the book.

The- authors, all in all, have
presented an interesting adven-
ture in an effective -way which
should prove good reading for all

Americans, but the book could 1

have been far better if the pace
with which the story started was
maintained throughout.
