Coed Fraternities Begin

Annual Spring Rushing

Ru shoes to Attend‘

Parties Tomorrow

Through Saturday

Second semester freshman and
‘transfer women will be guests of
the social fraternities at a series
of rushing parties beginning at
12 :30 o’clock tomorrow and con-
tinuing to 12:30 o’clock Saturday.

During this time, all eligible wo-
men will be rushed, feted, and treat-
ed by the 13 women’s fraternities.

Each fraternity may hold three
parties for its rushees. Invitations
for these parties have already been
mailed out and answers received.

These parties may be held between
12:30 to 2:30 o’clock and 5:30 to 9:30
o’clock on ‘Thursday; Friday from
5:00 to 9:30 o’clock.

Invitations for Saturday’s party
will be given to the girls personally
by the members of the fraternities
issuing them. The parties for Satur-
day may be held between 10 to 2

o’clock and from 5:30 to 12:30 o’clock. !

Following this last party on Satur-
day, silence week will be enforced
during which time no rushee is per-
mitted to say more than a casual
“hello” to fraternity members. Si-
lence week will be enforced from
12:30 o’clock March 5 to 12 o’clock
noon on March 12.

As speciﬁed by Panhellenic Coun-

Dean’s Office

‘Calls Halt

To l-F Contest

For the ﬁrst time in the history of
University fraternities there was to

- have been an oﬁicial queen of the In-

terfraternity Ball. But it won’t hap-
pen here this year.

A Heads of the 13 men’s fraternities
were to have met this week to nom-
_inate ten University women, from

Xwhom the I-F Ball queen was to have

been selected at the formal dance
Friday at the William Penn hotel.

Hearing of the plan, the ofﬁce of
the dean of women indicated disap-
proval. Thereupon the oﬁ‘ice of the
dean of men requested the resigna-
tion of Kal Kalwary, C40, I-F Ball

the contest.

When told of Kalwary’s forced res-
ignation Monday, Edwin Horne,
BA39, I-F Ball chairman, submitted
his own resignation to the oﬁice of
the dean of men. Horne’s resigna-
tion was not accepted.

Commenting on this action, Horne

; said, “It seems foolish to have dance
Newman Club, Pitkin,

Club, Kappa Phi, and Theta Phi Al-7

chairmen, if they are only to be pup-
pets in the hands of administrative
officers.”

Following is the text of Kalwary’s
letter of resignation:

“I hereby make known my resig-.
nation as publicity chairman for the
Interfraternity Ball Committee, to
be effective at once.

“I am sorry that my IF Queen
election, because it was unauthor-
ized by the dean of women, caused
the University so much unwarrant-
ed embarrassment.

“This student. was entirely ignor-
ant of the unwritten code that de-
mands all University activities and
fraternities to consult the dean of
women before originating or spon-
soring any campus project.”

Tickets for the I-F Ball are still on

The elusive Pitt Panther mysteri-

the eve of its twenty-sixth debut.
However, it is scheduled to appear
with a new suit and clean face at
8:30 o’clock this morning, according
to Editor Tom Smith, C39.

Numerous campus inquiries and
much consternation has arisen over
the “stop press” order issued Mon-
day. To the student body, to the
football team, to the building and
grounds department, and to The
Panther’s family the mystery is per-
plexing, Smith declared in an inter-

Squads Differ on Alliance Topic

By Fred S. Robie

With witty, hidden slams at both
America and Great Britain, the dis-
cussion of a possible Anglo-Ameri-
can collective security agreement by

at Inquiry Forum, Monday, resulted
only in vague generalizations about
the foreign situation.

Employing a cross-examination
style, Saul Dizenfeld, C39, and Ber-
nard McKenna, ‘C39 manager of
Men’s Debating Association, upheld
a course of isolation as best for
American interests against a propo-
sal of collective security submitted
by Hugh Robson of Sydney univer-
sity and Fred Thoneman of Mel-
bourne university.

As he remarked about the eccen-
tricities of American football, Rob-
son pointed out reasons why United
States should join Great Britain in a
collective security plan for
world’s good.

His argument for the necessity of
the agreement was summed up in
his statement, “There is far less
chance of American blood being spilt

association of democracies.”

He explained the beneﬁts of hisi
plan with ‘two points: (1) that
fascistic principles are endangering

0

the 3

the democracies of the world, and

(2) that there is deﬁnite threat of
aggression from these dictatorships
in Europe. ’

Dizenfeld cited Great Britain’s sel-
ﬁsh foreign policy as his chief ob-
jection to the proposed plan. He
made his argument appealing by the
quip, “the reason the sun doesn’t set
on the British Empire is because God
doesn’t trust Great Britain in the
dark.”

In the cross-examination, McKen-
na tried to draw from Robson the ad-
mission that Chamberlai_n’s present
policy of appeasement was the way,
to peace and that war was inevi.table
if the democracies decided to carry
the “big stick.”

After Dr. John C. Amundsen, in-
structor in history and chairman of
the Forum, introduced the cross-
questioning as “inﬁghting,” Thone-
man quizzed Dizenfeld on his mis-
trust of Great Britain. He wanted to
know if Dizenfeld thought that
America was still a “dumb Cluck”
colony and couldn’t compete with
English diplomats.

In answer to the question, after
the debate, as to whether or not

'Great Britain would join the fascist,

nations if turned down by America,
Thoneman said, “With ‘the present
government in power, anything base
and stupid is possible.”

fEditor’s Diary 

’UN'l‘lL just shortly before diary time today, we

were under the impression that the local Phi
' {eta Kappa meeting held in Pittsburgh last week,
on which we commented at some length, was a
purely local phenomenon.

It was, therefore, quite reassuring to hear that
the seiitiiiients expressed at the local garlieriiig
were ampliﬁed and made more oﬂicial  a meet-
iiig of the nation-wide group in New 3i'ci'l< City.
 our source, Time niagzizine, “The sober,
Scholarly Phi Beta Kappa
socictv . . was einerging from its ivicd saiictiiai-y
into the thick of world ziffairs, launching a cani-
paign to scotch “isms” and preserve ll1tellCClllU.l
xi‘-eedoni in the U. S.”

W'e’i-e glad to see the honorable meniliers of
tliis most llDllUl'able of American honoraries braiicli
out from their key—swingiiig activities to something
really vital. lt seems to us that_otlier coiiipara.-
tively dorinant lionorary groups niight well. awake
from their lethargy and pitch in to help Phi 
1{;,ppa in its “defense of iiitellectual treedoiii ‘—-
especially freedom on our college canipuscs~—aboiit
which Phi Beta Kappa seems to be most worried
and about which it certainly has a right to Worry.

Another item, or shall we say '"spl'.-isli,’”' in ‘the
recent; news that interested us, was the announce-
incnt of President Roosevelt
‘Bear Joint’ and ‘Bear Ell’
lettci-s to the respective lieads of the Cl() and
AFL. ’l‘he l’1'esideiit. taking time off from a ﬁsh-

" ing trip, has thrown in the net  an _appi'opriate
time. For the current factionalism in labor, if
allowed to continue, niay easily result in the nega-
ﬁOn or an thg progI'css made by Ol‘g'dlllZ0(l labor
under the paternalistic policies of the New Deal. '

\Vliat surprises us most, however, was that it
was old Bill (‘rreen who made the ﬁrst reply and
appointed the ﬁrst. committee (which 111Cll1Cl€S

Bill ‘rrcen, who was determined to ﬁght this bunch
of “Coinmuiiists” in the C10 to the last ditch. Bill

ncr Act.

\Ve rcmeinber, how, less than a year ago, _We
heard a'big AFL lieutenant in this district, saying
as to how he and other AFL leaders had advised
and would continue to advise Bill Green to refuse
any compromise with John L. Lewis, to make it a
“ﬁght to the ﬁnish.”

But evidently, Mr. Green ’s United Mine lVork-

- ers’ background must ﬁnally be getting the better
of him. At any rate, we hope that “l)eai' John”
will soon reply in kind and that this suicidal

To our naive

mind, there seems to be plenty of room in one labor
groilp for both craft and industrial unionism.

We also see that Britain and France have recog-
nized Rebel Spain, and have thus driven

The Final Coffin Nail

into the once hopeful Spanish Republic. Last Fri-
day, the American Student Union called for a “Na-
tional Student Protest Against the Embargo on
Spain.”

. It‘ was an admirable gesture, we thought, but
quite futile. For the goveriinieiit, as early as last
Scptcnibcr, seems to have decided in the negative.
And now, such actions on its part would merely be
construed as hostile to the great “dcinocratic” gov-
eriimeiits of Britain and France, who have carried
their noble policy of “noii-intervention” to its ﬁnal
h_vpoci'itical end.

Cliambei-lain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, & Go.
all ﬁnd themselves in the same boat. They must
now “save face” at the expense of one whose face
has been blown away by the fates of another “holy
war. ’ ’ = .. ; 

lt’s a far cry from Spain to the Hotel Scheiiley,
but we like to skip around in our diary.

 

‘We’re

Other dances, and many more important. ones, have
hopped without publicity. But we mention this
because We seem to recall lieai'iiig over and over
again for the past couple of weeks about how
‘anxious University students were to contribute to
a drive to aid their own students.

‘VVell, it seems that proﬁts of the CA daiices go
to set up a loan fund for needy students in the
College. that the size of this fund is dependent
upon the number of students who ai'e willii.ig to
pay the admission price of one dollar and thus. not
help an alien refugee, but an American student.

Despite this fact, however, there was more than
the usual amount of breathing space in the Schen-
ley ballroom Friday night. All of which may or
"may not mean anything. Uaybe the student body
is just a bunch of jitterbugs at heart and are saving
up their money to dance to Artie Shaw at the IF
Ball Friday night.

Or maybe they are just looking forward to that‘
exciting game with Minnesota promised by Athletic
Director Jimmy Hagan for 1943.

Dear Sir:

In view of the nature of the mimeographed sheet
which appeared on the campus on last Monday morn-
ing, I feel obliged, in justice to our Committee and to
myself, to publicly repudiate the views therein ex-
pressed as not being representative of the opinions of
)ur Committee.

We sincerely regret that our Committee isreceiving
enthusiastic support from people whose motives we
question. With us it is a matter of principle: with our
enthuisastic but mis-guided would-be cohorts we have
nothing in common. We therefore ask those responsi-
ble for the issuance of Monday’s slander sheet to stop
this sort of damn foolishness immediately. We do not
want this kind of support.

to get back in stride at 4 o’clock to-

iors bowl against each other in the
second meeting of their playoff series
at 8 o’clock tonight ‘on the Strand

heads a strong outﬁt which should
come out on top.

Final standings of the Fraternity
League indicate that there is a three
way tie for third place among Delta

Kappa Alpha. The tie will probably
be bowled off in the nearfuture.

While the inter-league playoffs
stealing the show_ this week, entries
are still coming "in for the spring‘

many teams as possible enrolled in
the program and urges that all teams
get their entry blanks in by the end
of this week if possible. Competi-
tion begins March 15.

The Phi Kaps’ victory on Monday
was accomplished with almost
ludicrous ease. Minus their scoring
ace, Croker, the Oilers were never
in the show. although Watson gave

Reich Announce

s Spring Festival

As Theme for News Style Show

Students to Dance
To Campus Band

Following Review

Fashions that will be in order dur-
ing the Spring Festival week will set
the keynote for the second style show
of the year, according to Jay Reich,
BA39, chairman.

Sponsored jointly by Rosenbaum’s
department store and by The News,
the free show will open promptly at
2:30 o’clock next Wednesday after-
noon in the Hotel Schenley.

News style show models will not
meet this afternoon as Originally
announced, but will meet some
time Friday, announces Jay Reich,
business manager. The meeting
time will be announced in Friday’s
News.

Besides showing what will be prop-
er for Carnival Night and for the in-
formal dances, the show will also
hold “the more timely note of an
Easter Parade.”

As usual, the show will feature
door prizes and “after the fashions”
dancing to the music of a popular
campus orchestra.

Reich announces that a script for
the show is under preparation. Jack
Hoeveler, C40, Patsy Grifﬁth, C40,
and Betty Adams, C39, are working
on plans and the script.

YMCA Freshman Club
To Elect New Officers

Election of ofﬁcers for the second
semester will be held at the next
meeting of the Friday Freshman
Club, according to Ed Tait, C42, pres-
ident.

Continuing the theme of student
leadership on campus, Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of men, will speak to
club members on the qualiﬁcations
stressed.

Candidates for election are John
Brosky, C; Walter Dickenson, C;
Charles Sarber, C; Bob Nickeson,
BA; and Tait.

‘Women May Learn
Tennis Techniques

All University women are offered
the chance to learn tennis and ten-
nis techniques under the instruc-
tion of Miss Joy Hartman, Ed40.

Miss Hartman, tennis title-hold-
er, will give instructions on the
game on Thursday from 1:30 to
2:30 o’clock in the new woman’s
gym. After the individual instruc-
tions, Miss Hartman plans to or-
ganize tennis teams.

This meeting is not restricted to
WAA members: any interested co-
eds are invited to attend.

Miss Hartman holds the Alle-
gheny County Singles Hard-Court
championship, and last year reach-
ed the ﬁnals in the National Park
temﬁs tournament. She is also
Vvestern Maryland singles cham-
pion, and, with her brother, Adri-
an, holds the mixed doubles cham-
pionship in Western Maryland.

PCW Students to Sing

An informal musical program will
be given in Foster Memorial by stu-
dents from Pennsylvania College for
Women this Wednesday evening.

The program, which will be from
7:30 to 10:30 o’clock is open to the
public. Materials from the Foster
Hall collection will be on display at
this time.

. . . this telephone idea can help you

HILE you’re in college, you’re on the consumer
side of the fence. There you’ll ﬁnd the "Where
to Buy It” section of your Telephone Directory a
quick, easy way to discover who sells what you want.

After graduation, you may be on the other side of
the fence, too—the seller’s side. As a manufacturer or
distributor of an advertised product you will ﬁnd clas-
siﬁed telephone directory listings a most effective and
economical way to direct buyers to the dealers han-
dling your product.

This directory service, tying up the national adver-
tiser with the local distributor of his product, is just
one of many Bell System ideas that help to increase
the value of your telephone.
