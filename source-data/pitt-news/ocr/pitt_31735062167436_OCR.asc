Oakland Police Prove

by PEGGY ALLEN

“Don’t judge all policeman the
same. We here (at Oakland) will
retain the ability to judge stu-
dents individually as long as we
are judged individually.”

This was the reaction of one
Oakland police officer, Patrolman
Leo Roller, to the comments made
by the North Side police, Pitt
News, July 2, 1968. Several of the
men at the No. 4 Station said that
they were unable to believe that
policemen would make such bia-
sed and illogical statements about
students.

“I think that we have a good
relationship with the students
here in Oakland,”said Desk Ser-
geant Kearns. “People classify all
students as hippies and this isn’t
true. Appearance does not and
should not affect the way a stu-
dent is treated. I’ve talked to nice
people in beatnik clothes and to
people in $100 suits that I would-
n’t trust.”

Not all the Oakland police talk-
ed so favorably of s t u d e n t s.
“You’re all communists!” said
one. “Why don’t you kids go to
Russia if you don’t like it here,”
added another. “Rights? You kids
have no rights. You're in school
to learn. We fought World War
II for you.”

But many of the police were
honestly concerned about improv-
ing the student-police relation-
ship. “Right now,” said one of-
ficer, “there are about 200 city
policemen attending Allegheny
Community College on their free
time in order to get a liberal arts
degree. Eventually, we will have
a police force capable of dealing
with students on their own level.’’

‘We Don’t Believe in Dodging the Draft,l

“Students say they’re going to
change the world — and I hope
they do,” added this police offi-
cer. “I respect those students.
However, they shouldn’t expect
special treatment simply because
they are students.” The police
seemed willing to treat students
as responsible citizens when the
students accept the responsibility.

Most of the police felt bitter

. Tl1ey’reNotAllTl1atBad

about the issue of police brutal-
ity. “Brutality is not defending
yourself if you are attacked. I
don’t think there is police lNutal-
ity in Pittsburgh. At least, I’ve
never seen it,” argued one offi-
cer. “We have to defend ourselves
if we’re attacked,” added a pa-
trolman. “The riot at Pitt last
spring was handled more than
fairly.”

2250 Plan To Enroll
As Freshmen In Fall

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

Although the “conglomeration
of statistics is not yet final,”
Bernard J. Kobosky, director of
admissions, offered the Pitt News
the latest statistics on the incom-
ing freshman class.

According to Kobosky, the Uni-
versity received 6,700 applica-
tions f or admission, 4,200 of
which were accepted. About 2,-
250 plan to enroll in September,
“a number rather larger than an-
ticipated,” revealed the director.

“The quality of the class is
strong,” continued Kobosky.
“Ninety—five per cent of them
were in the top two-fifths of their
graduating class; the other five
per cent were in the top three-
fifths division.”

The number of out-of-state stu-
dents has increased by about one
per cent. In 1967, the University
welcomed 165; this September,
210 non-Pei wsylvania residents
will be attend. 1.”

The task facing the admissions

staff is a “great challenge,” com-
mented Kobosky. “There are just
seven professional people on the
admissions staff with a clerical
staff of 11.

Peopling a freshman class in-
volves a “considerable amount of
recruiting effort,” explained the
ex-Air Force pilot. “The admis-
sions staff does quite bit of trav-
eling. I don’t feel effective with-
out visiting the area high schools.”

The admissions director stress-
ed that his office “works closely
with the undergraduate schools in
the University. But the Admis-
sions Office is a service function
of the academic schools. It imple-
ments policy only; it does not
make it.”

Another point that Kobosky em-
phasized is the importance of the
Admissions Office as the “first
contact that new students have
with the University. The kind of
place that the University is, is re-
flected here, in this office. And
we do everything we can to cre-
ate a good impression.”

Tuition   Hike   

State Can’t Supply Funds;
Under-grad Tuition Up $50

by BRUCE LEVENSON

The speculation is finally over!
Tuition rates will be raised for
the 1968-69 academic year.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar an-
nounced, Friday that the increase
will be $50 per term for full-time
undergraduate students on the
Oakland campus and for students
enrolled in post- baccalaureate
programs in medicine, dentistry,
public health, law, business, and
social work. Students in all other
graduate programs will pay an ad-
ditional $100 per term.

Regional campus tuition will
be hiked to equal that of the main
campus. Part-time students at all
campus will be subject to a com-
parable increase.

The subject of a tuition increase
has been up in the air since last
summer.

Governor Shafer has been un-
able to find the $27 million need-
ed by the University to operate
during the coming year. The Re-
publicans have blamed the Dem-
ocrats, the Democrats have blam-
ed the Republicans, the Legisla-
tive has blamed the Executive and
the Executive has blamed the
Legislative. What it finally
amounts to is this: the Pennsyl-
vania state government cannot
supply the full allotment that is
needed, and the University israis-
ing its tuition to make up for the
money that the Governor cannot
supply.

It has been reported that Penn
State and Temple will also an-
nounct tuition, in the near fu-
ture.

University students and faculty
members interviewed were unani-
mous in their dismay, but not

shocked at the announcement of
the tuition hike.

“I’m not surprised,” said Dr. H.
W. Safford, associate professor of
chemistry, “It’s been in the wind
for a long time. If they don’t have
the money, they don’t have it. ”~

CHANCELLOR
WESLEY POSVAR
Announces Tuition Hike

A female student who wished
to remain ananymous was “not
too happy about it. I was under
the impression that all state
schools were doing it. So, I’d like
a reason why it was only Pitt.”

One male student was not too
upset. “If they really need the
money then what can you do a-
bout it ?” he queried.

“It’s just another 50 bucks that
I’ll have to borrow somewhere,”
another male undergrad stated
realistically.

“Another 50 cees isn’t too had,”
indicated a commuting student,
“but what about next year?”

Governor Awards Grants
ToMetallurgical Engineering

Two awards have recently been
made to the University Depart-
ment of Metullurgical and Mater-
ials Engineering by Governor
Shafer. Dr. Edward I. Salkovitz,
Dean of the department, discus-
sed the financial reliefs and in-
centives that the recent grants
provide.

“The first, Project Grubsteak,

But in Resisting It’ — - Dave Morrison

by JUDITH GALARDI

“We don’t believe in dodging
the draft, but in resisting it. Con-
frontation is not evasion. You
could not pay us to accept a de-
ferment.” These are the words of

  
   

DAVII) MORRISON
Draft Resistor

 

Dave Morrison, who is 24 and
married. He has recently resisted
the draft. Morrison has renounced
an occupational deferment, when
he was employed at Pittsburgh
Plate Glass as a research chem-
ist a nd a student deferment,
which he could receive as a grad-
uate student at the University. He
has also renounced conscientious
objector status, for which he is
eligible as a pacifist or Quaker.

Before his induction Morrisson
said, “I will refuse induction Fri-
day because the draft exists to de-
stroy life, not just Vietnamese
life, but over 24,000 American
lives as well. This lifeless num-
ber in no way describes the thou-
sands of other men who have lost
their arms and legs, whose minds
have been shattered by the hor-
rors of war, and whose families
will endure needless suffering.
For all this there is absolutely no
political or moral justification.”

Morrison is knowledgeable of
the deferment policies and the ex-

 

emptions. “A 1-0 is an exemption,
not a deferment and a 1;0 does
not go into the Medical Corps,
but into the civilian work pro-
gram. l-A-0’s become medics.

The quotation . . . you must
believe in a Supreme Being” is
false. The requirement was drop-
ped last year, although it still ap-
pears on the CO form.

A humanist in Pittsburgh re-
cently received a 1-0. One does
not risk his II-S to file a 1-0
claim, as it will be evaluated only
when eligibility for deferment no
longer exists. Registrants should
consider filing a 1-0 claim while
they are deferred, not wait until
they are 1-A.

If a registrant does not have a
personal moral code, he probably
couldn't qualify. It is not neces-
sary to be a pacifist to be rec-
ognized a CO. I do not understand
the statement attributed to me,
“you cannot believe in existing
any type of force for any rea-
son.”

Morrison’s ancestral roots reach
back to the Revolutionary War
era, and are fairly deep. His ma-
ternal grandmother was a mem-
ber of the Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution, entitled to such
membership by the participation
of her ancestors in the American
Revolution. Also on the maternal
side, several generations back,
was Robert Fulton, inventor of the
steam boat. On the paternal side,
his ancestry includes David Rit-
tenhouse (1736-1796), inventors of
the planetarium and first direc-
tor of the U_. S. Mint.

According to Morrison, “Every
individual ha s a fundamental
right to determine his own des-
tiny; no governmental authority
such as the Selective Service has
the right, legal or moral, to tell
someone what to do with his life.
For these reasons, Morrison con-
tends that to accept conscienti-
ous objector status, a student de-
ferment, or any classification
would be to violate his consci-

ence.

 

is designed to provide the Uni-
versity with money to help new
professors get started in research
without government funds,” ex-
plained Salkovitz.

According to the Dean, $15,000
has been allocated by the legis-
lature. The first recipient of the
award will be Dr. Joseph Magill

who joins the staff of the de-
partment of Metallurgical and
Materials Engineering in August.

“Thus far,” revealed Salkovitz,
“Project Grubsteak is a one-shot
affair. It's up for discussion to re-
newal.”

The second grant is an unique
award for Pennsylvania. It sets up
a fund of $27,000 “to establish
fellowships which become avail-
able to especially deserving can-
didates,” outlined Salkovitz.

“The fellowships offer to doc-
toralcandidates free tuition plus
$4,000 a year expenses,” he con-
tinued. “There is also the possi-
bility of a forgivable loan of $2,
000 if the recipient makes an a-
greement to stay in Pennsylvania
for three years materials re-
search.”

Four scientists have been awar-
ded this grant for next year.

The recent grants should have
two beneficial effects, mused
Salkovitz. Firstly, they will pro-
vide financial relief for graduate
students in the field of Metallur-
gical and Materials Engineering.
They also encourage budding sci-
entists to stay in Pennsylvania.

“It’s an important project,” be-
lieved Salkovitz, “Because we
have a tremendous need for men
in this field. It’s also a big source
of revenue for the state.”

Tuitioii Hike

All students enrolled at the University received a letter
Saturday from Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar stating that tu-
ition will be raised $100 per year for the undergraduates and
$200 for graduate students. While the tuition hike has caused
a great deal of fiscal uneasiness on the part of the students,
it also strikes an unresounding chord of despair concerning
the effectiveness of state government and state-relatedness.

The University agreed to the “feasibility of state-related-
ness” with the hope that the ever rising cost of higher educa-
tion would be significantly reduced for many Pennsylvania re-
sidents who simply could not afford the high tuition costs
at the University. In-state students soon began to benefit from
the new arrangement. Their tuition was reduced from about
$1,600 to a yearly sum of $450.

But last fall there were some rumblings from Harrisburg.

‘the State Legislature, reducing itself to the low level of poli-

tical bickering, could not pass a budget. Consequently, the

University had to borrow some $5 million to maintain its op-

erating expenses. At that time, moreover, there were some ru-

c mors that a tuition hike for state universities would be forth-
coming.

These forecasts have finally proven to be quite valid. And
The Pitt News must place full blame and responsibility for
this contradictory tuition hike of the much criticized State
Legislature in Harrisburg. The members of the State Legis-
= lature have proved themselves to be less than fiscal experts.

A question of priorities is very much in the forefront of
this problem. Is it necessary to raise the tuitions of the state
universities — the very institutions that will ultimately bene-
fit Pennsylvania? Why can’t the legislature innovate fiscal
programs that will increase state revenues? What is so terrible
. about a State Lottery or “Flat Horse racing? These innova-
‘ tions have been continually by-passed by the status-quo
oriented body of representatives in Harrisburg.

Chancellor Posvar’s letter maintains that the tuition hike
may be rescinded. The Pitt News fears that if the tremors of
financial cacaphony continue to emantate from Harrisburg.
; tuition will doubtlessly be increased again and again.

Police

The Pitt News is presently publishing a series of articles
concerning the perceptions of the City police. Our reporters
have attempted to find out just what is on the minds of Pitts-

than encouraging.

In the first article a number of North Side policemen
were interviewed. They revealed a disturbing antipathy to-
wards students who “demand a say in things.” They believe
that “students are there (in college) to learn, not to question

. their professors.”

This somewhat closed minded response was supplemented
by the fact that many city policemen believe that student
activists are subversives and “commies.” Many of the offic-
ers believe that students lack the overall respect for their
elders and that this is dreadfully wrong. i

While a. good many of the officers interviewed maintain-
ed these very biased and somewhat bigoted positions, a num-
ber of policemen had more reasonable attitudes. One officer
said that “people classify all students as hippies and this _isn’t
ture.” Statements of this nature are a welcomerelief from
the small groundswell of ignorant and closed minded police
attitudes.

Unfortunately, the city law enforcement agent who “un-
derstands” is something of an anomaly. One officer told The
Pitt News that 200 patrolman are now taking college level
courses. This is 200 men out of sum total of 1500 police offic-
ers. This is a step in the right direction, but much more has
to be done.

We feel the police force has maintained the wrong philos-
ophy. They insist that the essential task of the police is to en-
force the law. The Pitt News, on the other hand, believes
that city police should take up the mutual task of enforcing
the law and preventing crime. But we insist that the educa-
tional backgrounds of city patrolmen must be improved consi-
derably before any reductions in the city crime rate will be
in the realm of possibility.

It's six-and-a-half hours to
Ocean City, N.J . by automobile.

And then it’s three hours in
Margate’s Maloney’s, two in the

to stay for the night.

Then it’s sleeping in your car
until 9:30 a.m. waking up with
an ache in the back, and heading
for your reserved weekend room
in Ocean City.

But those aspirins are needed,
and some breakfast is always
good, especially when it’s served
by Carol from Penn Hills. Her
last name doesn’t matter.

THEN ITS TO Granny’s bor-
ding house. -

And it’s down to the beach un-
less it’s raining like it did over
the Fourth. Then it’s crazy eights
with Marie from Jersey and Gail
who goes to Indiana State and
knows the brother of Pitt News

Then there's reading the pa-

one day, and next, seeing them
drop four games in two days.

And of course, there’s dry (sic)

ville, and Efferton (huh! ?)

INCLUDING the tan, the spir-
its, and the newness, it’s always
great. Any vacation is, especially
when a long-arm-of-the-law of-
ficer says he’li let you go this
time.

Yet the definition of a vaca-
tion is free from duty, or ser-
vice. It means free from the war
of the world. Free from problems
of life. Free from the typewriter.

But it does not mean free from
the mind because a vacation
allows the mind to roam free, to
jump boundlessly over and around
thoughts.

And that is where this column
begins.

IT WAS A COOL breezy night
after the rain. And it was a night
to recuperate from the ills of
drink and the tiredness of walk.
It was a night to bed before 2 a.m.

It was a night to meet an angel.

She did not float, nor did she
flutter into the dirty-blue week-
end room.

She walked-in.

Then she sat down, and began
her story, the beginning of her
yet unborn life.

SHE TOLD you that she had
always, had everything, a home
and two cars, honors in high
school, high grades, and the free-
dom to go to a college in Septem-
ber.

She had everything. But she
didn’t have satisfaction.

“Until one day I met other kids
at a camp once,” she said with a
beautiful teethy smile. “They
were like me. They had every-
thing just like me.” But they were
satisfied, and I wanted to know
why.”

So she asked them.

I ASKED one girl, who told
_me that she had never been satis-
fied either.” said the angel,
whose eyes changed from blue to
green depending on what ’she
wore.

“She told me that all I had to
do was sit down and talk to God.
I said okay, so what. And the girl
said to just talk to Him. Let Him

' I’

help you live. Let Him help you
help others. Let Him just take
hold of your life, and you would
be happy,” she explained.

“ ‘God knows you are sinful,
she said to me, ‘But He loves you.
And His love is great,’ ” said she.

So the angel did.

ONE DAY I said okay, and
I talked to God. Okay God, I want
to talk to you. Now you know how
unhappy I have been, even though
I have always had everything.
My mother even told me one day
that I should smile more because
I had so much. And that’s when I
put on my All-American smile
—and pretended that I was happy.
Now I’m asking You, I said to
God. And ever since, I have felt
great,” the angel said.

“You just have to let Him take
over,” she continued. “He wants
to help you,.if you just give Him
a chance. He will,” she said
smiling.

THEN, suddenly she left, she
crossed the hall, closed her door,
and was gone as quickly as she
came.

And when you woke up the
next morning and learned that
the room across the hall was not
rented-out during the weekend,
you would swear she really was
an angel.

I did.

 

 

Former Physics Professor,
Radiation L ict Dies

Alexander J. Allen, professor of
physics and former director of the
Sarah Mellon Scaife Radiation
Laboratory, University, died June
7.

Allen was born in Glenwood
Springs, Colo., in 1900. He re-
ceived his A.B. from the Univer-
sity of Colorado in 1923 and his
Ph.D. from New York University
in 1928. From 1929 to 1939 he was
associated with the Bartol and the

‘Biochemical Research Founda-

tions of the Franklin Institute in
Philadelphia, where he designed
and constructed one of the ear-
liest cyclotrons.

In 1939, he joined the faculty
of the University and began con-
struction of a second major cyclo-
tron. This activity was interrupted
by World War II, during which
he was a group leader at the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
n o l o g y Raiation Laboratory.
Shortly after the war he returned
to Pittsburgh as Westinghouse
Professor of Engineering and
Director of the newly founded
Sarah Mellon Scaife Radiation

Johnson Proposes Amendment

 

Lower Voting Age Seen Still Few Years Off 

by WALTER GRANT
College Press Service
WASHINGTON (CPS)—Despite
President Johnson’s support of a
constitutional amendment to
lower the voting age to 18, it is
highly unlikely that young Amer-
icans will be truly accepted as
participants in the political pro-
cess before 1971, at the very
earliest.

The President, in a special
message to Congress this week.
said the time has come to signi-
fy to the 12 million persons be-
tween the ages of 18 and 21
that they are “participants, not
spectators, in the adventure of
self-g'overnment."" Johnson thus
formally confirmed his support
of a constitutional amendment
designed “to grant our youth
what we" ask of them but still
deny to them — full and responsi-
ble participation in our American
democracy.”

A proposal to lower the vot-
ing age already has been spon-
sored by 44 Senators. Most ob-
servers, nevertheless, doubt that
Congress will approve the con-
stitutional amendment this year
since present plans call for ad-
journment the first week in Aug-
ust.

The Senate subcommittee on
constitutional amendments has
held hearings on the proposal,

"but a spokesman for the sub-

committee said an effort to send
the amendment to the full Judi-
ciary Committee failed last week
due to the lack of a quorum. He
said the subcommittee will not
meet again before the middle of
July, at the earliest. Even if it
approves the amendment then,
it would be almost impossible
for the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee——which is overloaded with
conservatives — and the full Con-
gress to act on it in the busy two
or three weeks before the ex-

pected adjournment date.

To be effective, the amend-
ment would have to be approved
by a two-thirds vote in both the
House and the Senate, and then
be ratified by three-fourths of the
states. Since all but three of the
state legislatures will be in ses-
sion in early 1969, if Congress
does not approve the amend-
ment this year, many of the leg-
islative bodies may not have a
chance to ratify it until they meet
in regular session again in 1971.

Governors of states where the
legislature meets only biannually
could, of course, call special leg-
islati.ve sessions to ratify the
amendment, but this would be a
great expense to the states, and
therefore is improbable.

In addition to these obstacles,
the amendment may face consi-
derable opposition by some of
the states, if not by Congress.
Opponents of extending the right
to vote to 18-year-olds are ex-
pected to emphasize two major
arguments: '

—-The recent wave of student
demonstrations indicates t h a t
young people between the ages
of 18 and 21 lack maturity and
are not ready for the political
process. During the Senate hear-
ings on the amendment, oppon-
ents argues that the demonstra-

tions prove young people “are
prone to take an extreme point
of view and push their ideas to
the exclusion of all others.”

—The states should retain the
power to set the voting age.

Behind most of the opposition,
of course, is the fear of politi-
cians that they will be voted out
of office if additional millions of
young people are given the right
to vote. Some observers already
have pointed out that President
Johnson did not support the
amendment until after be de-
cided to drop out of politics, and
he still waited so late that it is

unlikely Congress will have time
to act on it this year.

Presently, only two states —
Kentucky and Georgia—have low-
ered the voting age to 18. Alas-
ka and Hawaii, when entering
the Union. set the voting age at
19 and 20, respectively. Propos-
als to lower the voting age have
been introduced at one time or
another in most of the states,

.but have either never reached

the ballot or have failed.

Most of the arguments in fav-
or of extending the vote to 18-
year-olds were outlined in the
President’s special message to

“Throughout our history as a
young nation,” Johnson said,
“young people have been called
upon by the age of 18 to should-
er family responsibilities and civ-
ic duties identical with their eld-
ers. At the age of 18, young
Americans are called upon to
bear arms” and “are treated as
adults before many courts of law
and are held responsible for
their acts.”

The special message contin-
ued, “The essential stability of
our system is not served, the
moral integrity of our cause is
snot strengthened.
