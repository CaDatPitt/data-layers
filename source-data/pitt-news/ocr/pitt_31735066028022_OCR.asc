Piﬂ slueleni vs. the FBI Facul

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

 

After Sept. 15, Eric Davin’s cause might be
mentioned in the same breath as Roe v. —Wade,
Miranda v. Arizona and several other crucial
cases in American rights.

Maybe even more importantly, Davin’s
actions may give a man in his last years of life
the chance. to have his name cleared of false
allegations of being disloyal to the United
States. '

In 1986, Davin, a Pitt graduate student,
sought to write his doctoral thesis about the
National Workers Alliance of America, an
organization created in 1935, and its leader
David Lasser. He applied to the FBI for a
release of governmentrecords and information
about his subject.

After five years of -inaction on the agency’s
behalf, Davin filed suit against the government

but was defeated at the hand of a federal judge.

“The federal judge who originally heard this
case sympathized with the FBI and basically
said that they are the investigators, and if they
feel that release of these documents could hurt
them, then they must know what they are
doing,” Davin said.

However, Davin recently claimed what may
be the final victory in this battle when a Third
Circuit Court panel refused all but one reason
given by the FBI to withhold documents relat-
ing to the Alliance.

The FBI has until Sept. 15 to file an appeal to
appear before all 15 members of the Third
Circuit Court or possibly the U.S. Supreme
Court to find out if a previous ruling will force
the FBI to turn over documents to Davin.

“I think my ruling will stand, but the FBI will
file an appeal. They have no choice. This is the
biggest defeat they have ever faced and this

The Faculty Assembly
opened its first meeting of the
new school year to a wave of
concern focused on the effi-
ciency of the Pitt administra-
tion.

Discussion centered around
the faculty’s place in the deci-
sion-making process and their
inﬂuence on school policies.

The newly-elected president
of the University Senate, Keith
McDuffie,
Professor James T. Cobb, chair
of the Senate Bylaws and
Procedures Committee. Cobb
presented materials and opened
discussion concerning the uni-
versity’s policy development
process.

' He presented similarities in
the administrations of other

_ colleges and universities to

Pitt's.

Cobb said that one of the
things Pitt has in common with
other schools is the existence
of representative bodies com-
posed of faculty, and adminis-
trators and representative
groups for students as well.

The conclusion of the Senate
Bylaws and Procedures
Committee is that the seeming-
ly functional structure of other
school governments is similar
to Pitt’s. But there is much con-
fusion in the Faculty Assembly
as to the efficiency of Pitt’s
governance groups and their
ability to work together.

The purpose of the confer-

nsettling change is

Business mergers,

political upheavals, ‘waxing
and waning ideologies, top-
level restructuring — these
are the stories dominating
the headlines of national,
local and campus newspa-
pers. .

In this time of change, it
is comforting to look for the
constants. The role that
higher education is expect-
ed to play in our society is
perhaps one of these con-
stants.

Universities are the insti-
tutions that must describe
the truth about the causes
and relationships of natural
phenomena and histories,
and interaction of the inhab-
itants of our world. This
task is made possible
because of the diversity of
scholars and teachers who
bring a full spectrum of
backgrounds, perspectives,
desires and skills. A pro-

ductive tension within the
academy is the challenge of
blending together the
demand of democracy
which the majority voice
must predominate, and the
need of diversity to contin-
ue to hear an array of
accents and tones.

The University of
Pittsburgh continues to
struggle to meet the chal-
lenges and take advantage
of the opportunities of
diversity. In order to begin
to get a picture of where we
are on campus, the chancel-
1or’s Diversity Working
Group sponsored a survey
which was sent to 2,000
white and African-
American undergraduate
students in the spring of
1995.

A first look at the survey
results reveals significant
differences in the percep-
tions of the two groups in
the areas of institutional
attractiveness, racial cli-
mate, social climate, acade-
mic climate and faculty and
classroom behavior. Both
groups reportedly believed

will be a landmark precedent setting
l case in the area of the Freedom of
Information Act,” Davin said.

If the ruling for Davin stands, thou-
sands of requests for information previ-
ously refused by the FBI may be given
new life. Chapters of American history
could be re—w_ritten with the files the
Bureau has hidden.

“Some of the files I have received by
the FBI were created from electronic
surveillance, meaning wiretaps, and
records of meetings by planted agents,”
Davin said.

If that kind of detail and effort was
done to keep tabs on the Workers
Alliance, Davin said, it would be
impossible to even speculate what else
the FBI has on record about other
secretive issues.

“But if I win, we’ll find out soon.”

Davin said that even though the FBI
has produced some documents, some
have been heavily censored.

‘‘In one extreme case, I had a letter
that had the greeting and the signature
visible. The entire body of the letter
was blackened out.”

Davin thought when he filed for the
Alliance records that the Information

Act required the government to release
them, especially since Davin received
written approval from Lasser himself
in 1986.

“Unfortunately, it is difficult for the
FBI to leave the culture of the FBI,”
Davin said. “Personal files were J.
Edgar Hoover’s power base, and the
agency to this day doesn’t like to hand
over files to civilians.”

What Davin didn’t know when he
requested the files is that the Workers
Alliance, and more specifically Lasser,
was the subject of a 40-year investiga-
tion by the agency.

“Lasser was not a» Socialist or a
Communist. However, he was affiliat-
ed with them after those groups united
their unemployed workers’ councils
into the National Workers Alliance of
America, and Lasser was selected to
head the organization,” Davin said.

Lasser’s affiliation resulted in suspi-
cion by the FBI. Davin said that there
are over 1,000 documents held by the
FBI specifically about Lasser.

What does the 93-year-old Lasser
think about Davin’s actions?

“He has thanked me profusely,”
Davin said. “This is his final chance to
have his name cleared.”

During the Marshall Plan following
World War II, Davin said Lasser was
going to be hired by the government to
help re-build Europe, only to have
Congress pass a law specifically pro-
hibiting Lasser from ever being hired
by the government.

“That action was totally illegal and
unconstitutional,” Davin said.

Clauses in the information act allow
federal agencies to withhold docu-
ments if a case is still being conducted,
personal privacy will be violated,
sources would lose confidentiality or if
investigative techniques would be
revealed.

“During the investigation of Lasser,
there were no arrests and no convic-
tions. Few of the original members are
still alive, and I don’t think that any
investigative techniques done in the
‘30s are still so secret that they need to
be protected,” Davin said.

Davin says that without this ruling,
the FBI will continue to hide its
records in a shroud of secrecy, continu-
ing their bureaucratic stalemate on
releasing public documents.

.“I think they delay you so you do
give up. I have given up in the past, but
not this one,” Davin said.

If historians could be compared to
boxers; Davin would be a hungry Mike
Tyson in the middle of the most impor-
tant ﬁght of his life.

“Will I keep fighting even if they win
the appeal? Absolutely. To the very
end.”

Opinions

This book is required!

During the last few weeks you may have seen a large number
of students sitting on the ground outside of the bookstore in a

semi-daze for a few hours. If you have seen this, don’t worry.

These are just people who have stood in line for three or so
hours in order to spend around $300 on books they don’t really
want to read.

The fact is, books for classes have gotten ridiculously out of
hand. There are countless instances in the bookstore (you can
see for yourself) where instructors order upwards of 10 different
books for the semester, and plaster a big “REQUIRED” next to
every single one. Other instructors will only use one textbook,
but they find the single one that costs a small fortune.
Coincidentally, this is the very same book that will become
obsolete next year when the author decides to change one word
in the preface and publish it as a new edition. You are then stuck
with that overpriced bird—cage liner. -

Another problem is that professors label extraneous or supple-

. mentary books as “REQUIRED,” or they require students to buy

bocks that somehow mysteriously disappear from the reading
list by the end of the semester. Though it may be an honest mis-
take, and instructors may just over-budget their class time, they
should take into consideration the amount of money they are
asking a student to spend on books before they decide on that
eighth book which may or may not be read. Trying to get a
refund from the bookstore is like trying to walk across razor
blades while drinking hydrochloric acid.

The final problem you will most likely encounter is when you
try to sell your books back at the end of the semester. You prob-
ably will be stuck with that “Alien Communications, 4th edi-
tion,” since the author recently married and wanted her name
changed on the book beforeit was printed again. If you manage
to get even a fraction of what you spent back, consider yourself

V lucky.

More likely (especially if you had those classes which require
four or five paperbacks instead of one hardback book) you will
be able to get about $50 back per book. Some books have cur-
rent market value, of course, but only those which have never
been exposed to direct sunlight, cigarette smoke or oxygen. If
any of these have occurred, you will probably become the per-
manent owner of the book. A

And even though your used books bring such a miserable
price when you sell them back, you may have noticed them
being sold used for three or fourtimes what you sold the book
for. Aha! you say? Right. The bookstore continues to profit even
after you have been told your book has no value.

It is hardly fair that the university has found yet another way
to steal money from students. The university-run book store is
not a privately owned business. As a part of the university, it
should not be interested in making a profit. Instead it should
provide the services students need at a reasonable, non-profit
level.

And for future reference, don’t buy your books until after you
find out if that History of Underwater Basketweaving book is
really necessary.

Daniel I end of the
Weiss fossil fuel
age 1S now in
sight. As the world lurches
from one energy crisis to
another, fossil fuel depen-
dence threatens at every turn
to derail the global economy
or disrupt its environmental
support system. If we are to
ensure a healthy and prosper-
ous nation for future genera-
tions of Americans, only a
few decades remain to redirect
the energy economy. To stabi-
lize our climate and our econ-
omy, the United States will
soon have to reduce its con-
sumption. of fossil fuels.
Technology such as electrici-

ty, methanol, ethanol, natural‘

gas, solar power and even
hydrogen are at our disposal
and will be used to greatly
expand the use of renewable
energies once our non-renew-
able fossil fuels are used up.

Renewable energy sources
are actually far more abundant
than fossil fuels, especially
since they can be recycled and
reused. According to a report
by Christopher Flavin, presi-
dent of the World Watch
Institute, “The U.S.
Department of Energy esti-
mates that the annual ﬂux of
accessible renewable
resources in the United States
is more than 200 times our
current use of energy, and
more than 10 times the
amount of recoverable
reserves of fossil fuels.”

The ‘90s are likely to be
plagued by more frequent and
serious energy crises than ever
before. Political leaders, con-
scious of being re-elected and
avoiding the inevitable raising
of taxes, have little concept of
an energy system not based on
fossil fuels. Nor do they see
that an ‘alternative approach is
possible, which simply means
that they are reluctant to
impose taxes to invent a com-
prehensive new energy pro-
gram. Our current status quo
is entering a period of

inevitable and rapid change in
its energy systems, with little
idea of where we are headed
or how our course can be
shaped to accommodate our
needs and maintain our stan-
dards of living.

Aside from the smog and
carcinogens released by the
over 200,000,000 American
vehicles today (which the
Clean Air Act has managed to
curb only somewhat), there
are also numerous other
unmet environmental chal-
lenges for us to correct. At the
top of our list of priorities for
the ‘90s is reducing emissions
of carbon monoxide, nitrous
oxide and methane — all of
which contribute to the
Greenhouse Effect, and of
which automobiles are the pri-
mary contributors. _

While it is difficult to imag-
ine the worst consequences of
the ‘Greenhouse Effect, the
growing consensus of atmos-
pheric scientists is that the
threat is serious and demands
immediate action. If emissions
are not reduced to nearly non-
existent levels, climatic dis-
ruptions could eliminate virtu-
ally all Eastern forests, under-
mine the productivity of the
Midwestern grain belt, and
destroy up to 80 percent of
our coastal wetlands, accord-
ing to a report by the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
The federal government
should adopt an energy-plan-
ning process to gradually
develop, market, popularize
and eventually require the use
of alternative fuels for our
nation’s vehicles.

We must immediately begin
enacting comprehensive legis-
lation that will be drastic in
the long run, yet moderate and
economically sound enough
so that it will be able to con-
form to the environment,
economy, domestic security,
corporations and the people of
this great nation. This gradual
remodeling of our automo-
biles should initially make use
of domestically abundant,

low-emission natural gas.

Natural gas can be used in
gasoline and diesel engines so
that a gradual transition could
be accommodated.
Additionally, natural gas is
three times as cheap as gaso-
line on a per barrel ratio
($6.50 compared to $19).
With 150 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas reserves and over
400 trillion cubic feet of nat-
ural gas resources available,
the fuel represents an alternate
source of energy which has
both cost and environmental
benefits over oil. Hence, there
are already natural-gas-pow-
ered automobiles in use across
America today. If we are able
to decrease our use of oil for
cars, we could use the tremen-
dous savings to help power
more oil-reliant things, such
as jetliners. In addition to nat-
ural gas, we could begin a
gradual transition to cars
which will run on methane,
ethanol and electricity, all of
which are domestically abun-
dant, renewable forms of ener-
gies. Incentives and fines
could be imposed to help fund
such a program.

Investment in energy effi-
ciency is the most effective
response to our dependency
on nonrenewable fossil fuels,
for it is simultaneously an
investment in lowered oil
dependency, reduced air pol-
lution, greater savings and
increased climate protection.
Doubling the fuel efficiency
of a typical car using natural
gas to 50 miles per gallon
lowers its annual fuel bill by
almost $400, significantly cuts
emissions of nitrogen oxides,
hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide and halves harmful
carbon emissions. We should
set our goals to maintain a
healthy free market so that all
fuels and technologies can
contribute to the growth of our
economy, with which the sta-
tus quo has not provided us.

wide grin he extended his
long arm towards me.
Thirteen years old, I

I nervously shook his hand

Cal led us towards the
table where Baltimore
catcher Mickey Tettleton
and an Ori_ole coach were
writing their names on a

picture of themselves. To
the left of the table was a
big cooler with tiny car-
tons of milk that had a
cartoon of Cal on the back

for you,” the cartoon read.
Cal had taken a break
from signing and he want-
ed to drink some milk.

So off Neil and I went,
to drink milk with Cal

of the Baltimore Orioles.

I thanked him, shook his

Walk-on Durham receives scholarship

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

In Pitt’s game against Washington State,
Sadiq Durham was the smallest player on the
ﬁeld, but he felt like the biggest.

After not playing football in high school,
the 5-foot-6, 150-pound Durham decided to
take a shot at college ball and walked onto the
Panthers’ squad in 1993.

Even though he was on the team, he played
without a scholarship.

That was, until Thursday.

“I was told after practice, when we huddled
up. Coach Majors announced it then,”
Durham said. “My ﬁrst reaction was ‘I have
to tell my parents,’ because they’ve given so
much the last three years. It would be nice for
them to get a break for even one year.”

Durham thanked coach Majors in perhaps
the best way possible, by having the biggest
game of his career.

The last two years, Durham’s stats
matched his size: four receptions for
34 yards in 11 games.

But he smashed those numbers in
one game against the Cougars, mak-
ing eight catches for 80 yards. And
what doesn’t show up in those num-
bers is how important many of those
catches were.

Durham’s first of the game, for 16
yards, notched the Panthers their
first ﬁrst down of the game and got
them over midﬁeld for the ﬁrst time. ,

His second catch, for eight yards, 
set up Chris Ferencik’s 38-yard ﬁeld '
goal to put Pitt on top 3-0 at the end
of the ﬁrst quarter. It’s tough to tell
what might have happened if
Ferencik had to kick from 46 yards.

“I always tell John [Ryan] that I’m

throw to me.’ I guess that’s just a receiver
thing. But, he comes to me when he has to.”

Ryan went to Durham when he had to,
namely on Pitt’s ﬁnal drive.

On fourth-and—seven from their own 28,
and with three minutes left in the game, quar-
terback John Ryan dropped back to pass and
threw in Durham’s direction. Durham was
heavily covered but deﬂected the ball to team-
mate Curtis Anderson for a 12-yard gain and
a first down.

On the next play, Ryan connected with
Durham for 14 more yards and another ﬁrst
down. Then, two plays later, Durham made
his ﬁnal catch of the night, a 17-yarder which
gave the Panthers a first down at the Cougars’
nine—yard line.

That led to Ryan’s six-yard touchdown pass
to Dietrich J ells and a victory in a game many
people believed would be the key to a suc-
cessful season.

“As soon as we found out who we were
playing in the ﬁrst game, we started practicing
for them,” Durham said. “We went through
winter conditioning, spring training, fall camp
— I’m so excited because all the hard work
actually has paid 0 .”

Durham’s emotions couldn’t be held back,
as he danced and Mark Jackson-shimmied
around the sideline during, and after, the
game.

“I ﬁgured I needed to get hyped with the
fans and players,” Durham said. “It’s unusual
to turn around in the fourth quarter and see all
the fans that came to the game still there. That
showed me that they wanted us to win. It
showed the team that we needed to come
together like a family and go out and get this
win. We worked too hard to let this one
slide.”

And if anybody should know about hard
work, it’s Durham. '

A|vear's Hoosier experience pays off for Pih‘

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

A winner is defined as one who is, or will be, successful

Jim Madl/Staff Photographer

through praiseworthy ability and hard work. A winner brings
victory and admiration while changing the course of events in a
positive way. Lady Panther volleyball coach Cindy Alvear fits
this mold. Cindy Alvear is clearly a winner.

As a seventh-grader growing up in South Bend, Ind., Alvear
was an exceptional athlete. Throughout junior high and high
school, she excelled in volleyball and basketball, often taking
her team to the competitive Indiana state playoffs. When col-
lege came into the picture, a decision loomed for this star.

“When I was in high school, women’s athletics was clearly in
the infantile stages of recruiting,” Alvear said.

As a preseason all—state guard, Alvear was wooed by several
small schools in the hoops-crazy state of Indiana, but she knew
volleyball was in her future. .

Alvear eventually chose to attend Indiana University over 
perennial volleyball powerhouse Ball State. 

As a freshman on a talented~Hoosier squad, Alvear seemed to
get lost in the shufﬂe. It was not until immediately after her
first season that the pieces finally came together for the strug-
gling star. .

“I really blossomed physically and also as an overall player
during the summer between my freshman and sophomore sea-
son,” Alvear said. “The first year was rough. I had to struggle to
see any court time at all.”

Alvear did not waste any time, either. All she did that second
season was make the Junior All—Arnerican team and be named
co-captain. She was also named the Hoosiers’ co-captain in her
junior and senior seasons.

“I don’t think I was necessarily a vocal leader. It was more by
ability and ethic,” Alvear said. “Ifeel that leaders are born with
a certain personality. -Leaders should simply do what they are
asked, and more.”

Upon graduation Alvear was faced with a tough decision —-—
“where do I go from here?”

Baltimore’s Camden
Yards, against the
California Angels. He will
play in a baseball game

' for the 2,l3lst time in a

row.
In that span Ripken has

become the greatest all-

around shortstop ever to

- play. The only player who

could possibly be com-

pared to him is one who

never played a major

league game —— Roy

Hobbs, The Natural. With

Rip, people will look at /
him when he walks down

the street and say, “There

goes Cal Ripken, Jr. the

best there ever was.”

The two—time American
League Most Valuable
Player has hit more home
runs then any shortstop
and owns or shares eight
fielding records. He has
batted over .300 and dri-
ven in 100 runners three
times. He’s had over 200
hits in a season twice. He 1
has started in 12 consecu- ’
tive All-Star games.

But the stat that keeps
coming back is The
Streak. Paul Molitor,
another future hall of
famer, once said that old
record-setting players like
Cy Young, Hack Wilson K
and Lou Gehrig are like
cartoon characters. Those
stats — 511 wins, 190
RBIs in one season, 2,130
consecutive games played
— are not real, Molitor
said.

Somebody forgot to tell
that to Ripken.

In an era where players
get eaten by tarp cover-
ings and miss The World
Series, and pulled muscles
put pitchers on the dis-
abled list for two years,
Rip just plays baseball.
Everyday, since 1982, he
just goes out there and
plays, because that’s his
job. Like a construction
worker or cop, he gets
paid to do something
everyday and he never
misses a beat.

Now, back to the off-
the-field stuff. This is
truly what separates

Ripken from every other ' \/

professional athlete. He
doesn’t cough up the “ath-
letes shouldn’t be role
models” line, he revels in

Alvear

°From page 7

After interviews with several com-
panies, including Quaker Oats,
 Alvear decided to test the waters as a
 coach. This was because of a man
 named Jerry Gregory, coach of the
United States National Team.

Gregory and Alvear first met while
working with the Athletes in Action,
which is similar to the Christian
Crusade for Christ program.

One thing that Alvear was certain
of was her desire to impact the lives
of children.

Alvear coached with Gregory at the
University of Wyoming from 1984-
1988. She then reached a point where
she felt less than 100 percent com-
mitted to coaching.

She left the coaching ranks to work
with the Junior National Team, the
same team she had played for as a
sophomore at Indiana.

After her brief hiatus from coach-

“' ing, Alvear moved south to

National Team brought home the sil-
ver medal in the 1984 Olympics. The
Eastern United States has especially
seen volleyball grow, largely due to
the work of former Pitt coach Shelton
Collier and Penn State head man
Russ Rose.

“These men have established tradi-
tion and respect for women’s athlet-
ics as a whole. They came forward at
a time when many others simply fell
behind the pack,” Alvear said.

Alvear hopes to carry on the tradi-
tion here at Pitt as head of the pro-
gram. Over the last eight years the
Lady Panthers have dominated the
Big East, including winning an amaz-
ing seven Big East championships.

Away from the Field House, Alvear
also makes a healthy impact with the
Pittsburgh Golden Triangles
Volleyball Club.

“The club is similar to AAU athlet-
ics around the country,” Alvear said.

“I enjoy working in the grass—roots
level with kids. The participation in
similar programs nationwide is over
half a million.”

Approaching the latter stages of the
‘90s, Alvear is nearing her 20th year
of volleyball, whether it be as a play-
er or coach.

She reflects on those 20 years and
has many fond memories, including
an incredible upset of then-No. 1 Cal-
Berkeley as an assistant with
Wyoming. Alvear also remembers her
feelings when she was selected cap-
tain and when she was offered the
head coaching job after Woodstra’s
departure.

However, there is one detail that
obviously sticks out for Alvear, and
that is her daughter, Alexandra Leigh.

Alvear knows that coaching runs
into motherhood, and she is unsure
when it comes to looking down the
road.

“At this juncture, I see myself
always being involved with young
people,” she said. “I hope to be the
best mother I can be, and the
demands combined with coaching are
tough. Down the line I plan on hav-
ing more children, but in terms of
coaching it’s hard to say. I will have
been involved [with volleyball] for
nearly 20 years and there comes a
time when you enter a new season of
your life.”

Championships are a vital part of
coaching in any sport, on any level,
but with Alvear, the roots run deeper.
She has successfully kept the tradi-
tion of Pitt volleyball intact and
shows no signs of falling off the
pace. .

Whether it is on the court or off, a
a player or coach, Alvear has given
100 percent of her heart to the game.
The future will likely prove no differ-
ent, wherever she may go.

College Station, Texas, to take
 the assistant coaching job at
I  Texas A&M. Alvear spent two
years at A&M, and this is
, where she met Sue Woodstra,
1- who was then the head coach at
 Pitt.

Woodstra brought Alvear to
Pitt in 1991 to work as her
assistant, with the main respon-
sibility of recruiting.

» “I feel that I got where I am
 with the guidance of people

» like Jerry Gregory, Mike
English [with whom Alvear
worked on the Junior National
team] and Sue Woodstra,”
Alvear said. “Sue impacted me
on the "technical and strategic
levels more than anything.”

Finally, in 1993, Alvear took
over the Lady Panther volley-
ball program when Woodstra
accepted a professional coach-
ing position in Germany.

“Pitt has an excellent tradi-
tion, and when you have the
opportunity to impact it, and
you don’t take advantage of it,
it may not come around again
for a while,” Alvear said about
the position then available at
Pitt.

In her first season as head
coach Alvear guided Pitt to a
23-10 record, including a stel-
lar 7-0 in the Big East. That
earned the Lady Panthers their
fourth straight Big East cham-
pionship and a sixth straight
Big East tournament title.

In recent years, the populari-
ty of women’s volleyball has
been on the rise. This, Alvear
feels, started in the early ‘80s
when the U.S. Women’s

ders take a constant pounding, and
for West to come back less than
110 percent completely healed
would be utterly stupid.

There is no doubt that the run-
ning corps is now the weakest part

of the team, and the
shallowest in terms of
bodies.

“We have two or
three walk—ons that
work there, one of
them isn’t eligible at
this point, and
nobody stands out
there, I’ll tell you
that,” Majors said.
“We may look at
another position play-
er on scholarship, but
we haven’t made a
decision yet.”

Seniors Chris Patton
(9 carries, 31 yards),
and freshman
Demetrius Harris (5
carries, 32 yards)
filled in admirably for
the fallen West
against the Cougars.

And coach Majors thinks that
Harris has the talent to be an
offensive force.

“We think that Harris is a good
prospect,” Majors said. “He has
good quickness and speed, and is a
very good athlete. He’s going to be
thrown into service much sooner
than expected.”

Now there’s no doubt that the
Panthers offense will suffer with
West out. Where opposing teams
would spend time focusing on
West, they will now be able to
focus on the receivers.

By using the term “indefinitely,” .
there’s always the possibility West
will return to the lineup. It will
give opposing coaches something
to wonder about.

It’s highly unlikely that West will
return. But, who knows, maybe
that new million—dol1ar hydrother-
apy pool has some kind of special
power.

If not, there’s always good old:
fashioned milk.
