University of Pittsburgh

Oakland never stopped growing

By Jackie Duggan
Staff Writer

(Editors note: This is the second
in a three-part series on
Oakland, researched and writ-
ten by students in a Pittjoumal~
ism class.)

When Pitt’s aggressive expan-
sion of the late 1960s came to a
screeching halt after Oakland
residents rallied to prevent the
university from demolishing a
children’s playground, Pitt lost
ground that it has still not been
able to regain.

Pitt’s parking shortage, lack
of student housing and conflicts
with the Oakland community
are familiar problems. What
many probably don’t know is
how these problems originated
and why they persist today.

’ Many of the changes which
have occurred over the past 30
years are the result of Pitt
becoming astate school in
1966. This meant the state of
Pennsylvania increased its con-
tribution to the university’s
armual budget and allowed the
university to lower tuition costs.

For students who were
Pennsylvania residents, the
average tuition for two terms
dropped from $1,450 to $450.
The cost per credit dropped
fonn $38 to $14.

Enrollment shot up almost
immediately — more than
6,500 students applied for 2,000
freshman openings, and Pitt
officials estimate up to 10,000
students would have applied if
they had not stopped accepting
applications. ’ ’

“The university was not pre-

pared for the enrollment,” said
Jay Roling, director of
Community Affairs. “Student
size tripled in five years.”

Roling also said the Soviet’s
launching of Sputnik had a sig-
nificant effect on Pitt’s growth
during this period. Americans
thought there weren’t enough
young people in higher educa-
tion_, especially in comparison
to the numbers attending in
Europe.

“There was a movement to be
able to provide higher education
opportunities to sons and
daughters of blue-collar work-
ers,” said Roling. * i .

The rapid growthhelped to
bring about the housing, park-
ing and traffic congestion prob-

lems that continue to plague

The old cliche “one down,
one to go” can be applied to the
Student Government Board after
it completed the first of a two-
semestertenn with the conclu-
sion of last night’s ﬁnal meeting
of the semester.

The SGB is satisfied with its
accomplishments over the past

semester but also realizes that

there is plenty of work to do.

“I would hesitate to call [this
semester] productive, just
because tt1ere’s a lot of work to
do,” said SGB member Patrick
Huey. “There’s a lot to get done

between now and November
and December. But I am encour-
aged,” said Huey.

SGB member John Capriotti
agreed with Huey, in that there
is still plenty of work to be
done.

“I am very, very pleased with
what we have done, but we also
have to move foreward,” said
Capriotti.

Board member Julie Clouse
also felt that the semester was
somewhat of a success.

“I think we had a very produc-
tive first semester,” said Clouse.
“We learned a lot about the uni-
versity and I feel that we repre-
sented the students to the best of

If .you think that J.
Dennis O’Connor’s deci-
sion to eliminate
HealthAmerica as an
option for health care was

 

insensitive, be glad you
weren’t at the University
of Pittsburgh in the 1960s.

That was when Pitt was
making plans to gobble
up a children’s play-
ground, crossing entire

streetsoff the map and '

using the power of emi-
nent domain to redraw the
map of Oakland.

After the university
became a state—related
institution in 1966, it
expected to triple its
enrollment in three years.
The need to accommodate
the extra students and fac-
ulty led to the develop-
ment of the original mas-
ter space plan in 1968.

In the expansion
process, the university
upset residents of
Oakland, and Pittsburgh
city officials by taking
land without considering

what was best for the

entire community.

“They were not neces-
sarily trying to ramrod the
community,” said John
Wilds, director of the gov-
ernment relations office.
“But they didn't get upset
about the human cry.”

Jay Roling, director of
community affairs, was
one of the engineers who
led the boom of construc-
tion at Pitt both on and off
university property.
Roling, who has me]-
lowed considerably since
then, remembers himself

For The Pitt News

When Peri Jude Radecic
graduated from Pitt in 1983,
she hoped to work in a field
that would combine media and
politics. .

She moved to the
Washington area, hoping to

,find a job. Ten years later,

Radecic became the executive
director of one of the most
influential gay and lesbian
groups in he country, the
National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force.

Radecic grew up just outside
of Pittsburgh in the South
Hills. She attended Pitt on a
full track scholarship and
received All-American honors
for discus in 1982. She origi-
nally planned to major in
physical education but
changed her major to commu-
nications during her senior
year.

Radecic has held many posi-
tions as a volunteer. In 1984,
she helped amend the civil
rights ordinance in
Montgomery County, Md., to
include sexual orientation. She
was appointed commissioner
on the Rockville Human
Rights Commission. Later, her
work for the National
Organization for Women
included positions as vice
president for the Maryland
chapter and national program
director.

In 1987, she joined the

"NGLTF as the chief civil

    Take The Ea

rights lobbyist and eventually
became the group’s executive
director.

In_ addition to being in
charge of a 21-person staff and
a $2.6 million budget, “I was a
fund raiser, chief spokesperson
and chief policy director, “ she
said. .

Radecic said the NGLTF,
founded in 1973, has evolved
over the years, changing
slightly with each new execu-
tive director. Its main purpose
is to provide support for gay
and lesbian groups on a state
and local level. The organiza-
tion works to bring activists
together and train them to be
more effective, according to
Radecic.

Radecic said she is most
proud of her role in the Hate
Crimes Statistics Act, which
former President George Bush
signed in 1990. The act man-
dated a system for collecting
data on crimes committed on
the basis of race, religion, sex-
ual orientation and ethnicity.

“The reason the federal gov-
ernment can tell you how
many hate crimes exist is
because of that bill I worked
on,” she said.

According to Radecic, it was
the first time the gay commu-
nity worked with other minori-
ty groups to lobby for legisla-
tion. More than 70 minority
and advocacy groups joined to
fight for the bill.

Radecic recently left her
position at the NGLTF to pre-

pare for law school. She has

QPIH alum foheaci gay task force

applied to several schools and
hopes to start in the fall, con-
centrating on civil rights for
Native Americans." Radecic
said she wants to use her edu-
cation in tribal law to “correct
the wrongs” the government
has imposed on Native
Americans. ’ ‘

“I feel very strongly about
working on civil rights issues
beyond gay and lesbian
issues,” said Radecic. “I think
I have the skills to be a really
great litigator  I had to deal
with President George Bush
and Jesse Helms. I can’t imag-
ine a jury that will be that hos-
tile.”

Looking back to her college
days, Radecic said the only

thing she really disliked was A

“walking up Cardiac Hill,” the
hill leading to Pitt Stadium, for
track and field practice. She
said she enjoyed going to
school in the community she
grew up in and feels her edu-
cation helped prepare her for
her career.

“Some of the courses I took
have been invaluable to me,”
she said. “In retrospect, they
provided me with the skills I
needed later in life.”

‘ However, Radecic said acad-
emics are only one element in
a successful career.

“I think it’s really important
for people to look beyond edu-
cation and gain experience,”
she said. “I really advise stu-
dents to think about intern-

‘ ships, cornrnunity service and

volunteering?’

°From page 1
was unable to provide sufficient
housing, students were forced
off-campus and landlords found
they could charge high prices

"and neglect maintenance since

demand was so high. -

The campus area was inun-
dated with traffic that it wasn’t
designed to handle, and a
chronic parking shortage result-
ed. More garages resulted in
more people commuting in cars,
and the parking and traffic
problems were not alleviated.

In essence, the university has
never caught up with the effects
of the rapid expansion of the
1960s. At least part of the rea-
son was Pitt’s arrogance in
implementing its first master
plan. -

Pitt hired the architectural
firm of Deeter, Ritchey and
Sipple in 1968 to draft the first
master plan for the university.
The firm spent two years draft-
ing a plan that set aside geo-
graphic locations for various
academic locations. According
to Roling,» different departments
had certain space needs.

The problem between Pitt and

. the Oakland community began

when this master plan called for
the condemning of all homes
from Forbes Avenue to Bates
Street and then over to Oakland
Avenue. It also proposed build-
ing,Forbes Quadrangle along
Oakland Avenue and destroying
Bouquet Street.

Many residents were appalled
at Pitt’s drastic conquest for

property. But Pitt wielded the
right of eminent domain.

Because it was a state—related
university, the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania supported its
right to take land that was nec-
essary for the good of the state.
This power of domain is ‘what is
frequently used to build and
repair state highways through
small town or neighborhoods.
Pitt used it to make way for its
new buildings.

When Pitt attempted to do
away with the Falk School play-
ground in order to construct a
huge dormitory’ on the campus’
upper hill, however, the school
principal protested. Residents
decided that they’d had enough.

Sandy Phillips, now executive
director of Pittsburgh
Partnership for Neighborhood
Development, started a commu-
nity group called People’s
Oakland, and began to protest
Pitt’s aggressive expansion.

At first the university refused

to negotiate with the Oakland

residents, said Roling.

“At this time, the university
was insensitive to the communi-
ty,” said John Wilds, director of
Government Relations Office.

Phillips went to Pittsburgh
Mayor Pete Flaherty to get
more support concerning the
taking of private land for public
use. In the end the pressure
from Phillips’ group, Flaherty
and Governor Milton Shapp
forced Pitt to work with the
Oakland community.

plans came to a screeching
halt,” said Roling. “Sandy coa-
lesced an awful lot of people,
and as a result all politics
changed.”

Flaherty mandated Pitt to
meet with People’s Oakland and
send a representative from his
office to sit in on the meetings.
These meetings caused the cre-
ation of the dance studio, fine
arts gallery and the external
studies program offices on
Forbes Avenue today. Pitt
agreed to incorporate university
buildings and departments
which have relevance to the
community. A

Another reason Roling cites
for Pitt’s change in attitude
toward the community was the
social revolutions of the ‘60s.

_ Roling said the social move-
ment in Oakland was right in

line with the racial sit-ins, stu-
dent protests and war protests
that took place daily on the
Cathedral Lawn.

The university resumed its
expansion, but now dealt with
the various Oakland community
groups in the planning process.
Pitt experienced tremendous
growth between 1966 and 1976.
During this time, Pitt acquired
two million gross square feet of
space, 600,000 of which were

under or slated for construction.

By 1977, one-third of the carn-
pus in Oakland had been relo-
cated.

Benedum Hall, the Learning
Research and Development
Center, the Chemistry Building
and the Law Building were all
constructed during this time.
Forbes Quad was completediin
1978 on‘the site of Forbes‘ Field.

ARTMENTS AVAILABLE

Nevertheless, Pitt has been
unable to meet housing demand
or alleviate parking and traffic
problems. A

It meets strong community
opposition whenever it proposes
new building-projects.

While communication
between community groups and
the university has improved, the
conflicts of the last three
decades continue to‘ impede
resolution of problems facing
both the university and
Oakland.

who’d never met a bulldozer he
didn’tlike.

One of his most memorable
experiences in his work toward
university development almost
got him arrested.

Where the Law School now
stands, an alley called Gurtz
Way once existed.

Roling, in an effort to avoid
the delay of the Law School’s
construction, made the decision
to dig up the alley, despite the
fact that it belonged to the city.

Roling attempted to purchase
the street from the city but was
not willing to pay the asking
price of $98,000. Pitt and the
city were close to reaching an
agreement when Roling decided
to take the street and move
ahead with the project.

Upon hearing of Roling’s

actions, former mayor Pete
Flaherty decided to visit the site
to check out the damage and
personally deliver Roling a war-
rant for his arrest.

“I asked him not to handcuff
me, because I didn’t want my
kids to see their dad in hand-
cuffs on TV,” Roling said.

He said Flaherty took him
aside to get an explanation of
why the incident occurred.
When Flaherty asked Roling
why he took the street, Roling
looked at him and said, “No, sir,
we didn’t take it, but it did drop
26 feet.”

Flaherty then told Roling that
he wouldn’t arrest him and said
if Roling was working for him,
he would expect Roling to do
the same thing.

Plan, Roling said there is no
cause for alarm. “The figures
aren’t there for the university to
make another expansion, but a
lot of people got hurt in the last
one, so there’s some paranoia.”

Roling sees a much greater
spirit of cooperation now. Pitt
and community organizations
recognize that they have many
goals in common, Roling said,
including safety, resolution of
congestion problems and a
healthy local economy.

Roling said he and Sandy
Phillips, the community leader
who spearheaded much of the
opposition to Pitt’s expansion,
now have an amicable relation-
ship.

 Banthe Bomb

After twenty-five years, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is
up for renewal. The treaty was designed to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons and lead to the disarmament of those powers
who possess nuclear weapons. Yesterday was the opening of a
month-long conference to determine where the world goes from
here. One proposal calls for the treaty to be extended indefinite-

ly and unconditionally. This has been put forth by those nations

who acknowledge they possess nuclear weapons, according to
The New York Times.

Other nations want to give the treaty another limited exten-
sion, because they say that the nuclear powers have not lived up
to their end of the agreement to disarm and to spread peaceful
nuclear technology.

As Secretary of State Warren Christopher pointed out in an
interview with National Public Radio, the treaty faces opposition
because its success is measured in intangible terms. The
weapons not built and the wars that did not happen testify to its

success.
With nations such as Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and India

' most likely in possession of nuclear weapons and involved in

situations that might provoke their use, the world must make a
firm commitment to preventing the use of these weapons.

Fascists in Wales  

The United States is not the only country which is becoming
increasingly fascistic. It seems that violating human rights is now
becoming the norm in Europe (as if China weren’t enough!). In
Wales, males citizens are now suspects in a crime simply because
of their gender.

According to a report in The Washington Post, all men in a
neighborhood in Cardiff, Wales are being asked to submit to blood
tests for DNA testing. This comes in response to the rape and mur-
der of a 15-year-old-girl from the neighborhood. Police are expect-

ed to go to up to 5,000 homes to request blood samples. Not com- .

plying with the police request makes a man a suspect. Yet, if one

_ does comply with the request, it is because the police suspect

them. Either way they become a suspect.

A law called the British Justice Act allows the police to forcibly
take these samples during the course of an investigation. While the
British do not have the Fourth Amendment protection, this case
does raise some interesting questions about the nature of the law.

The crime was a heinous one, but the abuses of the rights of the
citizens is even worse. At what point does public safety become so
important that the individual members of the public are completely
disregarded? What is happening in Wales is an allergic reaction to
crime which is not isolated to that country. Crime is a terrible
problem, but the laws exist to protect the public, not force them to
conform to the will of the state and act as automatons. When this
distinction breaks down, the state becomes all important and the
people are marching in lockstep to the whim of dictators.

Fraternities even worse option. ' of Chancellor J. Dennis

While it is admirable that
the members of Phi Gamma
Delta have volunteered their
time (FIJIs volunteer for the
community, The Pitt News,
April 13), the fact that FIJI
was assigned community ser-
vice following a [alleged]
sexual assualt and incidents
of underage drinking that
occurred at aparty given at
their house should be noted.
In the article in question,
FIJI president Chris Nestor
stated that “the fraternity
was  required to do a cer-
tain amount of volunteer
work for social probations.”
A shameful act occurred at
the FIJI house earlier this
year, and a ‘punishment con-
sisting of community ser-
vice, among other things,
was handed down by the uni-
versity. It is inappropriate to
laud FIJI for merely carrying
out the conditions of their
punishment, especially when
the reasons that the volunteer
work was assigned are not
given in the article.

Republicans

Can the Republicans really
believe that the tax cut
recently bullied through the
House by Newt Gingrich is
in the nation’s best interest?
I suppose  they really
believe it. If that’s the case,
they are as crazy as the
Gipper was senile  Sure
“tax and spend” is not an
option — the Republicans
swept the House last fall
because the people want the
debt controlled and the
bureaucracy dismantled —
but “Reaganomics” is an

Reagan somehow managed
to single-handedly TRIPLE
the entire national debt dur-
ing his two terms.  I don’t
mean his contribution was
three times higher than aver-
age. I mean he tripled the
total COMBINED efforts of
the 39 presidents preceding
him! Just to make it perfectly
clear, at the end of Reagan’-s
term, over 65 percent of the
national debt had been due to
his administration. 

....Reagan left a legacy: a
federal deficit that was also

nearly three times what he

found it. That deficit is caus-
ing the debt to grow at near-
Reaganivistic speeds, and if
it is not controlled soon
there will be serious ramifi-
cations  The unprecedented
drop in the dollar in all the
major foreign markets for the
past month ... _is a foreshad-
owing of an impending glob-
al crisis.

So what are our options? I
see only one. I call it “Tax-
the-crap-out-of-everybody-
and-pay-off-our-huge-
freakin’-debt-before-the-
world-economic-system-col-
lapses.” As one Republican
screamed on the House floor
while debating the new bud-
get, it’s time to “put some
sanity into the federal bud-
get.” I agree — now if only
the Republicans would quit
acting like lunatics.

in opposition to the policies

O’Connor. However, the
announcement of his resigna-
tion pushed me into reﬂect-
ing back on his four years at
the University of Pittsburgh.

_While I agree that he did not

stick to his promises of open-
ness, I find it atrocious that
The Pitt News has once again
sought only to tell of the
negatives. In their graphic on
“The O’Connor Legacy” they
neglect to mention one posi-
tive achievement by the
chancellor.

The chancellor is a man
who deserves our gratitude.
He committed himself
wholeheartedly to improving
this institution and in the
process had many achieve-
ments. It was under his lead-
ership that the Master Space
Plan for campus utilization
and the document, Towards
the 21st Century, which is to
guide the future academic
development of the universi-
ty were started and complet-
ed. These are two projects
which will prove to be
invaluable to the future
growth of the university.
Additionally, during his term
the students have benefitted
from a number of improve-
ments including the shuttle
system, a revitalized food
service and a drastically
improved University of
Pittsburgh Police force.

On behalf of the past, cur-
rent, and future Pitt students
who have felt or will feel" the
positive effects of Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor’s legacy,
I would like to thank him. I
can only hope that our next
chancellor displays the same
initiative in improving the
university.

Parliy sucky
with lOO%

chance of

ow
that
the
eight bliss-
ful school
months have
blurred by,
let’s all take
a deep
breath, try to
recollect our
thoughts and
recapture every sucky thing

 

Columnist
Sean
Duncan i

I that has happened in the

world of sports.

The lingering baseball
strike definitely sucked, and
still sucks overly-ripened
cantaloupes to this day.
While attempting not to be
redundant, here’s my take
on this whole fiasco.

Cash rules everything
around us. That’s a fact
everyone has to deal with.
Most people in this over-
populated mudball we call
Earth are greedy. Everyone’s
looking to add to their bank
account, so who cares if
baseball players are greedy?
Wouldn’t you be if you had
a_chance to tack another
million or so on your con-
tract?’

I know there are some
people out there who dis-
agree, saying baseball
should be played for the
love of the game, but it’s not
just a game any more, so p
deal with it. _

I don’t give a crap how
much players get paid —
you shouldn’t either. All we
should really care about, if
you’re truly a baseball fan,
is seeing the best players in
the world on the diamond.
To see Frank Thomas and
his bulging biceps launch a
430-foot bomb in the right-
center bleachers. To see Ken

_ Griffey Jr. make a spectacu-

lar over-the-head catch as he
climbs the centerfield fence.

That’s what baseball is all
about. It’s not about watch-
ing Bob the Plumber loop a
Texas-Leaguer over the sec-
ond baseman’s head, and
then hearing about how
Bob’s lifelong dream was to
play in the majors. That
sucks, I don’t want_ to hear
that. What Bob needs to do
is go back to plumbing and
save his dream for the toilet,
because it’s being flushed
away.

Now if everyone will just
shut up and stop pouting
about how baseball players
are over-grown babies, let’s
play ball.

On the other hand, we
have those damn umpires
whining about money. Let

Doherty serves noticeof things’ tocome

Sophomore

ace gunning

for a//-time

sing/es mark

By Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

“Talk is cheap,” Braden
Doherty shouted jokingly
across the net at his team-
mate Matt Mills during ten-
nis practice Tuesday. It was
a half-jest from Doherty, a
19-year-old sophomore and
the Panthers’ No. 1 seed.

‘-‘I don’t think it’s correct
to trash talk people,” said
Doherty later, while sitting
courtside and wringing his
gray, sweat—soaked T-shirt.
“I’ve run into a fair number
of talkers, but I like to let
my play do the talking.”

He certainly has.

In less than two seasons,
Doherty has won 38 singles
matches, including 18 (the
club lead) so far this year.
And he’ll get at least three
more opportunities to raise
those totals before season’s

end. Even more important-
ly, Doherty is on pace to
smash the record for career
wins in tennis by .a Pitt

player — 54. He has more’

than two seasons to reach
and surpass the magic num-
ber. ‘

If Doherty does break the
record, it will be something
special, says his coach,

George Dieffenbach, a 20- '
year veteran at the universi-

ty.

“What’s I commendable
about that is the fact that
the record is held by a guy
who played No. 3 and
sometimes No. 4 in the
line-up,” Dieffenbach
explains. “Playing No. 1
[like Doherty does] in the
line-up and setting that
record is a real achieve-
ment.”

As the No. 1 seed,
Doherty (18-8) faces the
best men’s tennis player
from each opposing school.
He’s been seeded No. 1
since day one as a fresh-
man. But playing No. 1 is
harder than Doherty is mak-
ing it look. It’s not just
about winning, he says;
there’s also a role to play.

“Hopefully, the younger kids can
look at Chris and say, ‘Wow! Look
at the way this guy keeps work-
ing.”’

“It’s a matter of discipline. You
have to make some sacrifices, like
trying to have a social life,” said
Bean.

Gradually throughout his junior
year, bench time turned into playing
time. By the time the Big East play-
offs rolled along, Bean was one of
two closing pitchers utilized by
Jackson.

“He has worked so exceptionally
hard; it started to pay off last
year, and he pitched a number of
innings,” said Jackson.

This season, Bean has developed
into one of the Panthers’ top five
pitchers.

For the year, Bean has amassed a

1-0 record in six starts with an
impressive 3.60 ERA —- tops

among the regular Panther pitchers.
He is third on the team with 10
appearances and is second on the
team with two saves. He has also
fanned 25 batters in 30 innings of
work. ~

For the conference season, Bean
leads the team with five appear-
ances, a 4.50 ERA and two saves.
He has struck out nine opponents in
14 innings while allowing only one
home run, by far the best ratio on
the team. A

Pitcher Gregg Mrochko said,
“He’s become 100 percent better
since we got here four years ago.
He’s known for his control and he’s
pitching with confidence. He’s
always been a hard worker and he
leads by example.” .

Bean earned another honor over
the past weekend.

During Pitt’s tripleheader with
Connecticut, Bean was slated to
start.

“It was my first Big East start,”
said Bean. '

“It’s a great feeling, that’s what
you live for as an athlete
— the chance to play in big
games.”

“It was a real tribute to_ the way
he’s worked since he’s been here,”
said Jackson.

Despite earning a no decision for
his efforts, Pitt won the game he

pitched and the Panthers have won g

nine of the 10 games he has
pitched.

Coach Jackson said, ‘‘I’m going to
miss his work ethic and what he’s
done. He does all the intangibles,
and that is what makes a team suc-
cessful.”

After the season’s over, Bean
will graduate on time with an engi-
neering degree. After graduation,
Bean plans on attending Ohio
State University to further his edu-
cation.

them cry all they want;
replacement umpires are OK
because even Bob the
Plumber knows how to call
a ball or strike. Bottom line:

- whining umpires suck.

As we all probably know,
the National Hockey League
was also on strike. Ican’t
believe right in the midst of
hockey’s national boom,
they strike. Who cares?
Hockey is a communist
sport anyway. I’d be willing
to bet that half of the people
who are now interested in
hockey got interested
because they’ve played
NHL ‘95 or some other year
on Sega Genesis. Hockey
sucks, except on Sega.

Another thing that sucks is
the soon-to-be NBA rookie
salary cap. The whole idea
of limiting the salary of
incoming rookies is a good
one, but what it’s really
going to affect is college
basketball. So far, Arkansas’
Corliss “Big Nasty”
Williamson, Ohio
University’S Gary Trent,
Arizona State’s Mario
Bennett and the National
Player of the Year Joe Smith

have committed to this sum- '

mer’s draft.

Expect to see a lot more
collegiate players opting to
turn pro because of the
salary cap. Leaving school
early has been a popular
trend in the last five years,
but expect to see an uncanny
number of players flock to
the NBA ranks.

Leaving early sucks in
itself, but when players are
practically forced to leave in
order to get their big pay-
checks, that sucks even ‘
worse. I

Paul Evans sucks. Just the
thought of hearing the ex-
Pitt basketball coach’s name
murmured in a passing con-
versation makes me sick.
Ralph Willard has already
exorcised Evans’ demon,
but remnants of his being
still exist.

Basically, life Sucks.

they all represent the team
equally. There is pressure.
It’s difficult having every-
one gunning for No. 1, but
at the same time it’s all part
of the game.”

Doherty, who is always
capped by his lucky head-
band during matches, takes
the game seriously. H.is
teammates have taken note.
“He gets into it on the
court,” says Brad Wade, the
team’s No. 2 seed and
Doherty’s partner in dou-
bles. “I’m not as serious as
him.” '

In doubles, Doherty and
Wade have teamed for a 15-
12 mark.

In 1993, Dieffenbach

' recruited Doherty from _his

hometown of Toronto,
Ontario, Canada. Doherty
was ranked eighth among
high school tennis players
in Ontario. In .Doherty,
Dieffenbach saw “weapons”
— strong ground strokes, a

good overhead and a good
first volley. He also saw a
“humble” and “very coach-
ab1e” player. Today,
Doherty continues to devel-
op his “weapons” and tin-
ker on his weaknesses —
his serve and serve return‘.

“We work with him in
practice every day to make
these parts of his game
stronger,” said Dieffenbach,
studying his players from
the sideline.

“And in practice he works
hard hitting with every-
body.”

The love and knack for
tennis seems to run in the
Doherty family. Doherty’s
mother, Nancy, is a former
two-time Canadian junior

national champion. Not sur-

prisingly, Doherty says he
and his brother started
playing tennis at around
age five.

“It’s been in my family,”
says Doherty. “My whole
family is into tennis.”
