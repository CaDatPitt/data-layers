ennm rains TFVEDIE E

The High?Stepper is an ideal choice for Campus Type
#1 for two reasons. First, she is a fairly common spe-
cies-and second, she is easy to identify.

Just as the bird-watching beginner should concentrate
on the Robin, Sparrow and Cardinal before moving on
to more exotic species, the girl watching beginner should
master the observation and identiﬁcation of types such
as.the High-Stepper before progressing to rarer (and usu-
ally more diﬂicult to identify) types.

As in all ﬁne arts, the mastery of fundamentals is the
key to girl watching success. This mastery of fundamen-
tals is just as important in the art of cigarette making.

‘Graduate Humanities Club Hears Book Excerpt
Showing Abandonment of Anti-Heroism

   

“Thurber’s characters all use ﬂush toilets but you never

 hear the sound of them,” quipped Richard C. Tobias, profes-

ysor of ‘English who is writing a book on James Thurber,

0 spoke at the meeting of the Graduate Humanities Club on

ism in Malory’s “Morte D’Arthur”¢

_ ; with ﬁve small romance books.
' These books are: “Many Moon”,
“The Great Quil1ow,” “The White
Deer,” “Thirteen Clocks,” and
“The Wonderful ‘O’ .” . . . . . . . . .
= Tobias pointed out that Thur-
ber, who was generally an anti-
heroic writer, abandons this po-
'tsiion in his comic vision torecall
the herois rather than the natur-
alistic idea of romance.

Children Romances
“These ﬁve romances were os-
tensibly writen .for children,”
commented Tobias. “These ro-

mances provide Thurber with a

method of ‘statement. The ﬁve

books deal with a vision of ster-
ility. '

Tobias explained this vision
of sterility in evaluating each
of the ﬁve books with the Cel-
tic traditional legend of “Waste-
land."

“This legend treats of an in-
jured King whose country be-

\ comes a vast wasteland. The

kingdom requires a prince from
another land to bring fertility to
the kingdom.”

Previous Heroes

“Thurber’s previous heroes rep-

‘ resented the utmost in calamity.

. For evemple, Walter Mitty’s only

. escape is in terror-dreams. Thur-

* ber tells this story drowned in l

,_ ‘facts, rats and garbage cans,”

 commented Tobias.

‘ ‘Thurber abandons his comic
“Prui’rock’.’ in his ﬁve small ro-
mances. We now laugh because
he gets that other pleasure

 comic writer take pleasure in

' -—sex,” quipped the professor.

Tobias suggested that Thurber’s
_ was at Henry James world

. ' where everyone has money.

, “Thurber’s disbelief in the na-

‘ turalistic world of poets and writ-

ers’ ability to write, and lovers’

ability to love becomes credible
in these ﬁve romances,” added

Tobias. '

 “Thurber has found a frame
where his art can ﬁnd dimension.

He has also found an arch to give
- the reader an art with which he

can live. There is a subtle shift in

rhythm in his writing. Thurber’s
books freely invite study and
analysis,” he said.

No wonder the size and qualitynof

George Refner, “Part time jobs

“Since the band is such an

interested student. Thelband has
managed to draw comments
from the general "public con-
cerning the University’s failure

“A little less ‘concentration on

..The writer of the above letter
to the editor has brought up the
possibility that some of the ﬁnan-

Ski tlufb

By HEATHER ANGUS
‘The renovated Pitt Ski
Club is back on the campus
and looking hard for new
members.

' “We have to get at least 30
students to join,” Sylvia Ber-

dine, the vice-president of the
club explained. “And they must
be members who really enjoy ski-
ing and are willing to practice.”

“A lot of students show up for
the ﬁrst trip and expect to be pro-
fessionals in'-'a week. When they’re
-not, they drop out.”

Active {till 52

The Pitt Ski Club was active
atthe University until about 1952.
Then, due to lack of members, it
was forced to drop its official club
status." - ‘

Though it was not a recog-
nized organization, there still
remained a small group of stu-
dents who drove up to the ski
slopes on the weekends.

This year, however, the Ski
Club has once again obtained of-
ﬁcal status, with a president,
John Renkin, and vice-president
Sylvia Berdine. By recruiting new
members it hopes to remain a rec-
ognized club.

Trips Planned

Students who join the club may
go on every trip to Laurel Moun-
tain or Seven Springs. 24 trips

are planned for this season, but,‘

of course, the absence of snow
might reduce that number.

begins about 8 a.m. on‘a Satur-
day. The members usually ar-
rive about 9 a.m. when the
slopes open. They bring their
own lunch, and eat around noon

after a morning of skiing. In the
afternoon they continue skiing
or take part in the amusements

offered. The slopes close at 4:30 ’ A

p.m.; they arive back at the
University or their homes at
about 8 p.m.

Besides the skiing, the club also
plans to attend 12 safety sessions
on skiing in the Red Cross Build-
ing. The .ﬁrst two weekends.-in
November, some members will ski

at a dry ski clinic, whereskiing 

is done on straw or artiﬁcial ma-
terials. “But,” warns Miss Ber-
dine, “begining skiers should not

plan to attend this. It is for the. » 

more advanced.”

After that, tll skiing will be‘
done on the regular ski slopes,

where there" are hills for "begin-
ners as.well as for more advanced
students. ~

“Real beginners should probably V

plan on taking professional les-
sons, which are available at both

the nation’s only undefeated, un-

-team, West Virginia, during their
, ﬁrst three games, and he was
quite impressed with the view.
“They only beat Boston Univer-

' to our game. Even their coaches
, said they were elated to win.

#6 Eddie Barrett, says his team, how-

yardage fell from a whooping 414
yards, in the opener to a more
standard 164 yards against Boston.

He pointed out that the Moun-

“We have been playing it too
close, to the vest,”, Barrett*con-

criticism after leading Cali-
fornia by 20-9 "at halftime.

added that the current shut-out

A midwestern college audience recently heard this dnswerin
a talk by A. T. & T. Board Chairman, Frederick R. Kappel

“To us this is an important question because we hire
nearly 3000 college graduates yearly. To get an answer
we went to our own ﬁles and examined the records of
nearly 17,000 people. We checked each man’s compara-
tive success against what he achieved in college’.

“‘As a group, the scholars won handily. Of the men
who stood among the top third in salary forltheir level
of experience, more than half were also in the top third of
their college class. Only a quarter were in the bottom third.

“And contrary to age-old beliefs, extracurricular activi-
ties proved a lesser indicator unless the individual had an

outstanding achievement. Mere ‘joining’ was not enough.

“The study indicates, at least as far as the Bell System
goes, that there’s l-ittle opportunity for college students

1

who practice ‘diplomaship’—the

belief that a diploma

-automatically leads to job success. Such-thinking will
not make telephone service what we know it can be.

“The men we want are men with intelligence plus
those other attributes that give you the feel, the sense
that they will make things move and move well—men who
want to excel and are determined to work at it.

“Nothing short of excellence will do.” V

ers Test West Va.

“I think we’ll get the Varsity Marching Band out. for
every game now,” said a happy and appreciative Coach Leo

.7’ Bemis, recalling how his soccer team kept perfect time to

their arrival Saturday, blasting Akron, 5-1..’
‘I The British fought to lyrics during their earlier wars,
Bemis ﬁgures, so his team might as well keep in step, too.

But marching out of the West¢

Virginia hills this weekend comes
a new and formidable opponent
for the booters and bandsmen to

‘ -cope with-—the first varsity Moun-
taineer soccer team.

The teams clash at 10:30 a.m.
Saturday at Forbes Field. The
Mountaineers will try to improve
on two losses to the Panther jun-
ior varsity in 1961, when they fell,
4-0, and 5-3. '

Bemis is conﬁdent that the
Mountaineers can’t do it. He
says his team arrived Saturday
with the winning Akron effort.
“We opened them up," he said,
“and when we open them up we
get goals. We knew we could
shoot; we were going to score

" soon.”

Sophomore George Shimpeno,
who executed a “hat trick" against
Akron, will be Bemis’ big gun,
along with Corky Cuthbert, who
rammed in his second score of
the young three-game season.
Powerful Dave Reichenstein has
also clicked twice.

Defense Assists

But "the win was not all oiTen-
sive. Co—Captains Paul Liberati
thwatred several scoring threats
by angling booming kicks past
the man rushing him. The starting

I. fullbacks, Co-Captain Rich Veng-

lik and Chuck Dunbar,
numerous timely saves.
And the men up front couldn't
have scored without the valu-
able assists from “middlcmen"
Ted Verlato, Jerry Yospin and
Bruno Schwarz. In limiting
Akron to one score, goalie Tom
Staab lowered his per, game
average to one point a game.

made

The school record of 1.1 was
set in 1954 by Donald Clark.
Shimperno already has a good
jump on the season scoring re-
cord of 17 in 1955 by Robert
Cherry. But he’ll have to keep a
fast tempo for the remaining sev-
en gamesr
- Mountaineer Coach Jim Markel
will counter with what he calls
an improved team.

The Mountaineers face Frost-
burg today, _a team that fell to the
Panthers, 2-0. The Morgantown
booters did, however, blank West
Virginia Wesleyan, 5-0,iin their
opening game.

Forward Corky Cuthbert has
an.excellent chance of breaking

the career goal scoring record on
the Panther soccer team. He has
scored 18 so lax, even though
he was sidelined most of his
sophomore year with injuries.
The record of 24 was set in
1955-57 by All-American’ Jerry

more games in which to do it.

Injuries, Navy,

This Weelielld

“We’ve had more injuries than
you're supposed to have in cross-
country,’? said Coach Carl Rees,
explaining his team’s humdrum
2-2 record. A

“But that’s not" our real trou-

ble. We still should do better,” he
said. “But Bill Mocnik and John
Bailey haven’t been able to do
as much as they should. .
"And Ralph Basinski was sick
in bed for three days ‘prior to
the Penn State meet. He had an
intestinal virus and still he ﬁn-'
ished fourth for us. As for the
other guys: they’ve had just too
much trouble.”
This was all said as Rees was
trying to ﬁgure out how to cope
with Navy this weekend at An-

napolis, where 60 to 70 Middies.

try out for cross-country.
Reessays they have ﬁve letter-
men back, including Joel Heine,
last. year’s winner when the’ Pan-
thers lost, 20-39. The other four
are.Ernest Detrick, Jim Howard,

Maz Ricketts and Dave Lapham..

Heine’s time of 22:48 was one of
the best ever recorded on Flag-
staff Hill. ‘ '

Pitt’s Steve Waslo was second
against Navy last year——but that
was last year.

“They really disappointed me,”
said Coach Bill Kaliden, review-
ing his 36-21 loss to the Navy
Plebes Saturday at Annapolis.

“I thought we had a chance to
win that one,” he said. “But we
got too far behind too early to
come back.” Navy led the Cubs,
22-7, at half time.

“Navy has a fast team -— not a
big one — but really fast,” Kali-
den said. “This isn’t why we lost,
however. We fumbled the ball

Not All Bad

Kaliden noted, however, that
the team does have some good
ends and guards from what he’s
seen so far, and that these are
two positions which will need
sprucing up on the varsity next
year.

“I liked the way Kenny Lucas
handled himself at quarter-
back,” Kaliden added, “and I
thought Eric Crabtree made a
few__ nice runs.” ;_ "

Lucas pitched two touchdown
passes, a 40-yarder to end Mike

Zalnosky, and a 30-yarder to end‘

Ed Assid. Crabtree bulled for 15
yards for the other tally.
Kaliden singled out Barry Mc-
