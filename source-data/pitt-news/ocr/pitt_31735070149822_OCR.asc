T-Rav’s BBO Lab makesreturn to itt’scampus

By Megan Trimble
For The Pitt News

Forbes Avenue came alive with the
sounds of students making their
way ‘up and down the street late
Friday night, but one familiar voice
rang out above the rest. Beneath a
white—and—red—striped umbrella
outside the IGA, T-Rav has set up
shop. I
Below—freezing temperatures
did not deter hungry students from
coming to see if what they read on
their Twitter feeds was true. For-
tunately for all who went search-
ing, smiles and laughs of relief
conﬁrmed that the man shouting
and dancing back and forth next to
his grill cart was none other than
24-year-old Travis Huntley — bet-
ter known as T—Rav — and he was
back in business.
The brief disappearance of the
South Oakland staple had left stu-

, dents yearning for a late-weekend-

night snack.

T-Rav’s BBQ Lab previously op-
erated on the corner of the Sphinx
Cafe and Hookah Bar property on
Bates Street in South Oakland but
had been shut down earlier this

school year due to lease disagree-

ments.

The lease for the Sphinx Cafe
states that if any changes are made
to the property, including placing
a grill outside of the building, the
real estate company — Oakland
Real Estate Co. — must be noti-
ﬁed. The Sphinx owners gave T-Rav
permission to operate without the
company’s consent, so T-Rav even-
tually had to go.

T-Rav’s new set up at IGA came
with ease, because the grocery
store has had a hot dog stand out-

side of the building in past years. —

Ron Levick, the owner of IGA, told
The Pitt News in November that he
was happy to have T—Rav in front
of the store.

Levick isn’t the only one satis-
ﬁed with T-Rav’s return.

Students readily welcomed
back the familiar smell of ‘barbe-
cue as they lined up for the grand
opening Thursday night. The BBQ

Lab will be opened permanently
Thursday through Saturday from
10 p.m. to 3 a.m_.

“To tell you the truth, I love‘
it,” T-Rav said, referring to his
new location. “It’s a lot closer to
the freshmen, a lot closer to the
students up the hill, and it’s a lot
closer to the people of the"city here
in Oakland.”

The location and operating
hours are not the only aspects of

. the BBQ Lab that have been altered

for the business’s return. Along
with serving his classic menu items
of hotdogs, hamburgers, cheese-
burgers, pulled pork and kielbasa,

T— Rav now ﬂips veggie burgers and‘

veggie dogs as well.

“I can ﬁnally join in the T-Rav
experience that I have heard so
much about,” sophomore Rachel
Mauer said on the impact of the
menu change.

A vegetarian, Mauer had not
been able to order any of the items
at the shop’s previous location. Her
ﬁrst experience with T-Rav’s would
not go forgotten.

“I now know one thing: Rain,
sleet or snow, there will be T-Rav’s
in my stomach,” she said.

Sophomore Meg Fromuth, a
returning customer, was just as

pleased with T-Rav’s reappearance ’

on campus.

“I’m so fantastically excited, I
almost can’t explain it,” Fromuth
said.

The convenience and accessi-

bility of the new location did not go
unnoticed by customers who found
the walk no longer than those to
the eating options that they oth-
erwise faced.

T—Rav’s BBQ Lab is joining an
area of Oakland that is charac-
terized by its nighttime eateries.
Essie’s Original Hot Dog Shop.
and McDonald’s are situated on
the same stretch of Forbes, and
Sorrento’s and Antoon’s popular
pizza shopsare no more than a
few blocks away. _

Students heavily populate the
surrounding restaurants on the
weekends, but T-Rav’s hot dogs and
hamburgers, covered in homemade

barbecue sauce, set him apart.

“A slice of pizza is just a slice of V

pizza, and it will always be there.
Now homemade burgers from a
cart, they will always be so much
better,” Fromuth said.

Loyal customers like Mauer and
Fromuth provide T—Rav with the
assurance that his business will
continue to grow.

During his break from serving
students, T—Rav developed plans
that he hopes to implement in the
near ﬁiture. _

He currently operates Down-
town on the corner of Fifth Avenue
and Wood Street on weeknights
and in Oakland on the weekends.
Though he does not offer any day-
time operating hours as of now, he

' is looking for another location at
which to cook during the day in ,

Oakland.

As for this summer, T—Rav said
that he is unsure whether the BBQ
Lab will stay as the smoke from
the grill could upset residents with
open windows living above IGA.

T—Rav and his customers openly
exchange celebratory high—ﬁves,
shouts and jokes in greeting. As
he dances and hums behind his
grill, T-Rav acknowledged multiple

reasons why his customers have
returned-

“One reason has to be my fa-
mous sauce,” T—Rav said. “My
barbecue sauce goes back four
generations. I learned it from my
granddad, and he learned it from
his dad.-”

The secret" family recipe that V

dates back to the 195o’s reinforces
multiple other reasons that cus-
tomers have returned.

He said that great food and a
good atmosphere will create a pos-
itive experience for the customers
that come to order. And for T—Rav,
it’s all about the experience.

Originally from Farrell, Pa., T-

Rav said that he does not have the ,

luxury of being in the comfort of
his family all of the time.

“What makes me most excited
about being back is seeing all of
my loyal customers,” he said. “I
actually like to call them my fam-
ily, because they are my family
away from home. Getting to see
my loyal customers is being back
with family.” _

Looking from his grill cart to the

smiling customers laughing and —

eating around him, T—’Rav shared
what everyone was thinking.
“Yeah, I’m home,” he said. H

A MIDWESTWN PIECE

USmust intervene in Syria

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

  

, The Arab Spring has changed the

political dynamics of the Mid-
dle East. Many a politician has
praised and offered support for

. Arab protesters and rebels who

are struggling against tyrannical
governments. ;

Yet.we see a surprising silence
when it comesto Syria. H

The V Assad family has ruled
Syriafwith aniron ﬁst since 1970.
There has always been a nucleus
of oppositionto this family, which
up until this point most famously
found expres-

ernment, and the U.S. and EU
have imposed sanctions of their
own regarding the country. How-
ever, our involvement is not near-
ly what it was in Libya, where in
conjunction with NATO we prac-
tically provided the rebels with
an air force. On Syria the admin-
istration has not said much, and
very few are advocating broader
U.S. intervention. They should
be.

U.S. intervention, or at least
support for the rebels, would not
only be good on human rights
grounds but would also serve
ournational interest. Bashar al-
Assad’s government is one of the
most implacable foes of the U.S.
It is one of

sion in the city

ly extinguished

power until his
death in 2000, .

he was unable to completely
extinguish opposition to his re-
gime, an opposition that took
to the streets against Bashar al-
Assad, his son, in March 2011.
Bashar has responded harshly.
Though casualty reports are
hard to verify as few indepen-
dent journalists are active in Syr-
ia, the U.N. estimates that 5,000

_ civilians have been killed since

the start of the protests, most
of them unarmed. The situation
has gotten so bad that the Arab
League, an association of Arab
states, has suspended Syria’s
membership in an overwhelming
vote and has set up a monitor-
ing mission in the country. The
League has also imposed sanc-
tions on Syria. Considering that
the Arab League is not exactly
famous for its love of democratic
norms, this is a signiﬁcant state-
ment.

Much more signiﬁcant, Iwould
point out, than any that has come
from our own government.

There was and has been much

‘ condemnation of the Syrian gov-

extensively
~ in Lebanon
and might have been connected
to the 2005 assassination of for-
mer Lebanese Prime Minister
Raﬁc Hariri. The government is
also one of Iran’s closest allies in
the region, and the Los Angeles
Times reported that in 2011, Iran
sent advisers to Syria to help As-
sad cling to power. In 2007 the
Israeli Air Force struck Dair A1-
zour, a site that the International
Atomic Energy Agency believed
was most likely a covert nuclear
reactor. It is difﬁcult to think of
the removal of the House of As-
sad leading to a much worse out-
come than the status quo.

Some are concerned about
the potential loss of stability that
would come as a result of dumping
Bashar al-Assad. Syria is a com-
plicated place, with large minori-
ties of Alawite and Druze sects of
Islam as well as a sizeable popula-
tion of Christians. The north has
a substantial population of Kurds.
The Muslim Brotherhood is ac-
tive as well, and this makes some
people nervous. Syria shares a
border with Israel, as well as a

border dispute over the Golan
Heights. It is not unreasonable to
wonder what would happen if ev-
erything were suddenly to go up
for grabs in Syria. However, it is

'quite possible that things will go

up for grabs with or without U.S.
intervention. Units of the Syrian
army are defecting to the rebels,
and protesters increasingly have
decided to start shooting back at
the security forces. Part of Assad’s
bid to remain in power likely will
involve his administration’s try-
ing to play the various sects and
groups in Syria against each oth-
er; meaning that even if he does
cling to power, he will rule over a
country bitterly divided. Sectar—
ian violence is a real possibility in
Syria even if the U.S. does noth-
ing. Doing nothing would only
give the U.S. less inﬂuence over
what ultin1ately ends up happen-
ing in the pivotal country. ,
What form should U.S. in-
tervention take? Sanctions and
diplomatic pressure are good
starts, but these might not be
Very effective: North Korea and
Cuba have weathered them for
years. The U.S. should seriously
consider imposing a no-ﬂy zone.
A no-ﬂy zone would essentially
encourage more defections from
the Syrian army: One thing that
prevents such defections is that
soldiers who defect need to make
their way to the north, where
the Free Syrian Army (rebels) is
camped out. In doing so, how-
ever, defectors the risk of being
bombed from the air. If that risk
were to be removed through a
no-ﬂy zone,then the possibility
of defection would become much
more tempting. It’s also possible
that the no-ﬂy zone could expand
into more of an intervention on
the Libyan model, which would
give the rebels a ﬁghting chance.
We should also pressure the Ar-
abs and the Turks to act, as these
parties would be able to provide
political cover for U.S. actions
and seriously damage the Assad
regime in their own right. It is
time that we extend our support
to those ﬁghting one of the most
odious regimes in the world to-

day. [

If freshman Rebecca Fulmer eats
food that has even been grazed
by a utensil that has touched food
including gluten, she plummets
into agony. And unless it is spe-
cially prepared, almost all food
contains gluten.

At 16 years old, Fulmer was
diagnosed with celiac disease, a
disease of the intestine that pre-
vents a person from being able to
handle gluten. Because of celiac
disease and other gluten-sensitiv-
ity issues, there has been a grow-
ing awareness of the importance
of providing gluten—free food to
people who are allergic.

Gluten is a name for the pro-
tein groups gliadin and prolamin
and is predominantly found in the
wheat seed. It gives elasticity and
the doughy texture to breads, ce-
reals and pastas and is also used
as a ﬁller in a huge number of
processed foods and beverages.

Fulmer is the secretary of the
Gluten Free Club at Pitt, a club
formed in October 2011 by fresh-
man DhanalakshmiThiyagarajan.
Thiyagarajan said that the club
is an emotional support group

for people who have celiac dis-
ease and other gluten-sensitivity
problems.

“I can still remember the taste
of normal food,” said Thiyagara-
jan, who was diagnosed with a
wheat allergy just a little over “a
year ago and has had difficulty
coming to terms with the limits
on her new diet.

Along with the 30 other mem-
bers of the club, Thiyagarajan
wants to expand food choices and
bring awareness of the serious-
ness of gluten allergy to people
on campus.

For example, Fulmer said in an
email that when she eats gluten,
“I get very sick in the stomach  I
can be sick for a few hours or for
a week. I also get severe joint pain
when I eat gluten.”

Today, celiac disease and in-
tolerance to gluten are on the
rise, said Julia Greer, the direc-
tor of the 2nd Digestion and Nu-
trition course at Pitt’s School of
Medicine.

Greer said that doctors are
not exactly sure why there is an
increasing prevalence of gluten
sensitivity, but some attributedit
to a combination of genetics and
the fact that so many more foods

January 17, 2012 I The Pitt News I VVVVW.pittl1eWS.C0l11

in the U.S. are being processed
with different grains.

“It’s estimated that at least
3 million Americans have celiac
disease, and many more are sim-
ply intolerant of gluten,’’ Greer
said in an email. “About 15 years
ago, the incidence of celiac was
believed-to be about 1 in 3,000;
now we think the number is clos-
er to 1 in 100.”

According to Greer, gluten-
free diets have become a trend in
the past few years. But gluten—free
diets are not necessarily healthier
than diets that include wheat. ’

“It is not healthier unless
you have celiac disease,” Greer
said. “In fact, the majority of the
breads, pastas and cookies that
are manufactured to be gluten-
free contain less ﬁber and are
higher in calories than their glu-
ten-ﬁlled counterparts.”

Greer said a gluten-free diet
can be healthy if one substitutes
processed foods with fresh foods
such as fruits and vegetables, but
a diet of rice pasta and gluten—free
brownies is not the way to go.

With more people discovering
gluten intolerance in America,

Scammelli Gluten-free
lifestyle gets easier

By Kira Scammell
Staﬁ‘ Writer

This is the ﬁrst inran occasional
series about gluten intolerance
that will include stories and in-
formation about life without glu-
ten. '

It’s Wednesday night in Mar-
ket Central, and all I can see is
bread. Basic Kneads is all about
the sandwich staple, Bella Tra-
toria spoons out pasta and shov-
els out pizza, and the Flying Star
Diner surrounds its burgers and
sandwiches with a cushioning
bun.

But I can’t enjoy these things.
As I wander to the back of Market
Central, I check out Tutto Fresco,
the safe haven the dining hall has
carved out for people like me:
people who can’t eat gluten. My
options are white rice, chicken,
spinach and brownies for des-
sert. Unfortunately, I’m a veg-
etarian, which means I’m even
more limited.

It can be difficult to lead a

gluten-free lifestyle, even when
eateries do create special dishes
to suit my dietary requirements.
Gluten is a protein found in
wheat, barley and rye. It often
lurks in foods under other names
too. For example, malt is a deriv-
ative of barley, so things like malt

_ syrup are off limits. Gluten is also

in a lot of processed food, natural
ﬂavorings, salad dressings, soups
and even gum.

There are numerous reasons
why some people aren’t able to
consume gluten. A very common
one is celiac disease, which doc-
tors can diagnose with a blood
test. Celiac disease is a disorder in
which villi in the intestines’ lam-
ina propria lay down. In English,
that means that your small intes-
tine is unable to absorb nutrients
when gluten is eaten. The disease
affects about 1 in 133 Americans,
according to the ‘National Center
for Biotechnology Information.

But it’s not just people with
celiac disease who have problems

“The.Lion King” ﬁrst reignedover
the box office nearly 20 years ago,
in the midst of a Disney heyday
that deﬁned‘ a generation. A re-
visiting of“The Lion King” in the-
aters in September 2011 proved
that Simba could still sway the
masses —— the ﬁlm pulled away

‘as September’s highest gross-

inglmovie. This past weekend,
“Beauty and the Beast” graced
the bgigfscreen for the ﬁrst time in

.dé¢a;1jes; And just like “The Lion *

A Disney’srecentcornmitmentto
Hollywood’s fascination with 3-D
has spurred a movement to‘ revisit
its classics. “The Little Mermaid,”
“Finding Nemo” and “Monsters,
Inc.” will be retreated. -
The 3-D craze» has enjoyed
great success, but a notable di-
vide amongmovie fans became

evident following the success of I

eye—candy blockbuster “Avatar.”
Two camps were formed: those
who absolutely love seeing mov-
ie's in 3-D and those who desper-
ately wish it would go away. Even
the critics are split —— Roger Ebert
dedicated an entire blog post to
explaining why he is against 3-D.

o

 

But thel§}J;.extra dimension in
movies isnftf entirely a new fad.
It saw ﬂeeting popularity in the
1930s and’ then again in the
19505. What» separate’s today’s
3-D from that of yesteryear are
the large leaps in technological
innovation. According tojeff Hin-
kelman, video collections man-

' ager and instructor at‘Carnegie

Mellon University, most theaters
have now upgraded their viewing
technology to better support and
showcase 3-D movies.

Put simply, the sweeping 3-D
development owes much to the
new advancements that allow lo-

cal theaters to properly handle

the format. _ .

But Will Zavala, an instructor
at Pittsburgh Filmmakers, voiced
the _questions of ﬁlm fans and ex-

perts alike: Is 3-D here to stay as _

the next advancement in ﬁlm, or
will it fade once again from the
screen? Considering that 3-D has
actually worsened the movie go-
ing experience for some with its
increased prices and side effects
such as headaches, many feel the
trend has room for improvement.

Three-D might previously have
been used as a marketing gimmick,
but if utilized correctly, the prod-
uct can be astounding. Dream-

Your Dragon”‘did not disappoint,

Many‘ directors and producers
have properly -wielded 3-D as a
visual enhancement. Even Ebert
couldn’t help but admit that he en-

joyed the 3-D graphics in “Hugo” I

and “The Adventures of Tintin.”
Even considering the stigma

against 3-D and the" format’s

uncertain future, the numbers

pulled in by the rereleased Disney .
' movies (“The'Lion King” took in

at least $61 million, and “Beauty
and the Beast” earned $18.5 mil-
lion its ﬁrst weekend) display an
opposition to the 3-D grievances.

Despite the success of the Dis-
ney rereleases, manywere initially
concerned for whether 3-D could

‘-be rendered to  ’ .
and argued that the style‘s*be- V

 

   

longed to separate spheres and
were simply incompatible.

Yet after seeing “The Lion
King” in 3-D, many noted a dis-
tinct beneﬁcial element that 3-D
animation added to the movie
experience. A few scenes looked
better in their original 2-D depic-
tions, but the feelings of inclusion
that 3-D brought to the stampede
and battle scenes were worth the
price of admission.

Even if the 3-D had fallen com-
pletely ﬂat, the movie would still
have seen box-oﬂice success. The

cessful monetary performance

“The Lion King” and Beauty

ﬁlms that already have a built-in
following. The 3-D animation
adds or detracts from the expe-
rience, but it does not desecrate
the story. _ '

Ultimately, the possibility of a
bad 3-D movie can’t ruin the mag-
ic of Disney. And with directors
employing 3-D to enhance a ﬁlm’s
visuals rather than as a market-
ing technique, the 3—D experience
is set to see improvement in qual-
ity and viewer reception.

been diagnosed with gluten sen-
sitivity. If you count the number
of people with gluten sensitiv-

ity or intolerance, the number '

of Americans who can’t consume
the protein gets even higher.

I ﬁrst suspected something
waswrong a few months ago. For
the last two years I had suffered
from migraines, digestion issues,
unexplained bloating, fatigue
and irritability. After searching
Google for information about my
symptoms, I pinpointed them to
a gluten allergy. I recognized my
allergy with the help of Pitt’s di-
etician, Meg Mayer- Costa.

To test for gluten sensitivity,
Mayer—Costa had me cut gluten

I out of my diet for about two weeks

to see if I felt any better. She then
suggested I reintroduce it into my
system and see if I had a reaction.

Allow me to recount the sort
of disappointment that comes

with reintroducing a much-
loved food you’re allergic.to.
On the eve of my gluten rein-
troduction, I went to Local, a
restaurant in" the South Side.
I ordered a wood-ﬁred, mar-
gherita pizza, topped with
fresh tomato. It was personal-
ized pizza heaven.

About halfway through the
pizza I started to feel strange.
My temples began to throb,
my face started to turn red and
my stomach churned. But the

, worst and strangest symptom

was my inability to unshrug my
shoulders, like my head was
trying to curl into my body.

While all this was going on,
I just wanted to keep eating my
pizza. Heaven knows I tried.
I made it through three out of
the four pieces before literally
eating myself sick. Unable to
contain my disappointment,
I openly started crying at the
dinner table. .

My date ate the rest of my
pizza, and in my sick haze I
glared at him in jealousy for

the rest of the evening.

From that point onward, I
knew I had to give up gluten.
The ﬁrst month was discourag-
ing. I almost felt as though my

have a more positive attitude, and,

MEN’S BASKETBALL

less to No.1 Syracuse Orange seventh straight for Panthers

Byjon Anzur
Staff Writer

Pitt fell to Syracuse 71-63 on Mon-
day night, providing further evi-
dence that this year’s team is a far
cry from last year’s Big East regu-
lar-season championship team.
Monday’s loss extends Pitt’s
losing streak to seven games,
during which it has averaged 15
turnovers. The Panthers (11-8,
0-6 Big East) had 13 turnovers
against Syracuse, several of
which led to fast-break dunks for
the Orange (20-0, 7-0 Big East).

The easy buckets contributed to
Syracuse’s 52 percent ﬁeld goal
percentage in the ﬁrst half, de-
spite their shooting a dismal 14
percent from beyond the arc.

In last season’s win against

"Syracuse, the Pitt men’s basket-

ball team started the game by
scoring 19 unanswered points.
This season, however, the Pan-
thers were on the scoreless end as
the top-ranked Orange raced to a
13-0 lead. Pitt responded with a
9-2 run of its own, but turnovers
and poor shooting prevented any
chance of a comeback.

Pitt entered the game with the
second-worst defensive ﬁeld goal
percentage (43.9) in the Big East.
Syracuse’s 48.7 shooting percent-
age leads the Big East.

Paced by Dion Waiters’ 16
points, the Orange had ﬁve play-
ers ﬁnish in double-digits. Seven-
foot center Fab Melo dominated

- the paint, registering 10 points,

six blocks and a career-high 10
rebounds,

Pitt’s offensive woes continued
Monday night. The Panthers shot
39 percent from the ﬁeld and 30
percent from the three. Ashton

Gibbs followed his career-high
29-point performance ‘against
Marquette on Saturday with 10
points against Syracuse. Lamar
Patterson and Cameron Wright
each added 10 points for the Pan-
thers. ‘

Talib Zanna’s jumper pulled
Pitt within four points of its op-
ponent with eight minutes to play
in the second half, but that was
as close as the Panthers came to

leading. Syracuse’s two 3-point-N,
ers on back-to-back possessions’

restored its double-digit lead and
effectively ended the game.

The win marks Syracuse’s best
start in school history. It was also
only the third time that the Or-
ange has defeated the Panthers
in the Jamie Dixon era. Before
Monday night’s loss, Pitt had won
eight of the last nine meetings
against Syracuse.

Panthers wrestling making strides

By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ‘ Writer

EWL match. The Panthers’ ﬁrst
goal is to become the league

Pitt’s wrestling team is in the
middle of its best season yet. With
a 10-1 record and a six-match
winning streak, the Panthers are
starting to see their lofty goals
become reality.

Back in November, the
Panthers knocked oﬁ Lehigh
University and the University of
Michigan one week apart. Both
squads were ranked No. 6 when
they lost to the Panthers.

The tough out-of-conference
schedule has prepared the
Panthers for their current run
which could include a shot at the
NCAA Championships for several
of the team’s wrestlers.

“Wrestling top teams showed
[the Panther wrestlers] the
intensity it will take to win the
[Eastern Wrestling League]
again and to succeed at NCAAs,”
assistant coach Matt Kocher
said. “We have to compete at
that intensity, hustling for every
score. That is what you need to
do.”

The intensity that propelled
Pitt to big victories against top-
ranked teams carried over into its
match at Bloomsburg on Sunday.

“We ran away with [the
Bloomsburg match] because we
showed that intensity,” Kocher
said.

Pitt defeated Bloomsburg 30-3

Sunday, winning its 15”‘ straight

Li‘1d.u1plOnS for the third straight
year, but the coaching staff has
set some even loftier goals for the
team as well.

“At the beginning of the year
we wanted to win the conference,
ﬁnish in the top 10 in rankings and
qualify every guy for nationals,”
junior Anthony Zanetta said.
“Those are pretty highly set
goals made by our coaches, but I
think it is good we set our goals
high because it gives the guys
-something to try to accomplish
and push ourselves to achieve it.”

Zanetta didn’t just stop at
the team goals, but set goals for
himself as both a wrestler and as
a person. Ranked 16“‘ nationally,
the 125—pound junior holds a
record of 11-0 in dual meets and
22-2 overall this season.

“I have a goal every day.
That is to better myself in every
aspect of wrestling and also as a
person,” Zanetta said. “I know if I
do this every day I will achieve my
ultimate goal as an All-American
and national champion. It is just
something you have to believe
in.”

In such a successful season,
talk of NCAAs and All-American
status is bound to go around
the locker room, but the team is
trying to remain focused on each
match as it comes. '

“It is hard to stay focused
every day.” Zanetta said. “It’s a

battle we have to go through. As
of now, we try to block all the
rankings and stats out and focus
on wrestling. If we do that, the
wins will follow.’’ C

With the winning has come a
positive side effect.

“The mood out there is real
good,” assistant coach Jason
Peters said. “We have worked
hard. The guys are very excited
about the opportunity that they
have. When you’re winning, the
mood is always pretty good.”

Coming off the large victory

over Bloomsburg, the team is
hitting its stride down the stretch
after struggling slightly in the
Pitt Duals — despite ultimately
sweeping all four matches.

“The guys couldn’t get
motivated for [the Pitt Duals],”
Kocher said. “We ﬁxed that and
can’t overlook anybody. They
are feeling good coming off a
weekend we dominated and
wrestled well.”

The mood is something that,

Zanetta hasn’tbefore experienced
during his time in the program.

“The mood lately has been
something I haven’t seen or felt
in the three years I’ve been on
the team,” Zanetta said. “We are
having fun, but at the same time,
we know when to switch the
mood and get serious. I think that
is the perfect mixture of emotions
to keep the guys motivated
throughout the long season.”

Pitt returns home to the
Fitzgerald Field House Friday
when the Panthers battle EWL
foe Clarion University. The match
is set to start at 7 p.m. 3

Knowyour rights before searching-for apartments

By Kirstin Kennedy
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Sifting through the legal jargon
that accompanies the process
of renting a house or apartment
might be one of the dullest en-
deavors of your college expe-
rience. But although it can be
monotonous, .it’s actually very
important to understand the le-
galities of this process. Renting

an apartment and signing the '

lease is a serious commitment.
It binds leasees to unfamiliar
legal precedents and holds ten-
ants accountable for potential

, damages. To ensure both that

your landlord or renting agency

Renters should be aware of landlord responsibilities.

abides by their legal boundaries
and that you have the invaluable
knowledge of what you can ex-
pect from them, here is what you

need to know about your renter’s —

p rights:

The right to a copy of your
lease: As a renter, you are entitled
to a tangible copy of your lease,
as well as-the right to-have a law-
yer look over the contract before
you agree to commit. The lease
agreement is something that you
will want to have in your pos-
session for the duration of your
landlord/tenant relationship.
If you are unsatisfied with the
lease, you ‘can’ ask the landlord
or renting agency questions or
suggest revisions to the d'ocu-
ment prior to signing it.

The rights of the Landlord
and Tenant Act: The Pennsyl-
Vania Landlord and Tenant Act
is. a document that outlines the

‘legal roles of the landlord and

the tenant. Understanding it
will prevent you from violating
your terms of tenancy as well as
inform you of the precise role
of your landlord. If there is ever
legal action taken against you by
your landlord or if you run into an
unforeseen issue with the rented
property, grasping the Landlord
and Tenant Act will allow you to
understand what steps to take to
alleviate the issue effectively."
The rights of the Federal Fair
Housing Act: You are protected
by the Federal Fair Housing Act,
which outlines the constitutional

requirements of fair housing.

These laws are in place to ensure

that individuals looking for hous-

ing are not discriminated against‘
due to race, color, religion, sex,

national origin, handicap/dis-

ability or familial status.

The right to the _Code Enforce-
ment Bureau: According to the
Tenant—Landlord Handbook
of the Fair Housing Council,
a tenant-advocacy organiza-
tion based out of Harrisburg,
the Code’Enforcement Bureau
acts as a helpful supplement to
the Pennsylvania Landlord and
Tenant Act. Code states that it
is within your rights as a renter
to research-your property at the
Department of ‘Code Enforce-
ment. This agency will tell you

 

  
  tgji 

 

if the building has beenrecently
inspected, if there are any re-
ported issues or complaints with
the landlord of said property or
if there are any speciﬁc concerns
with the property that the land-
lord did not make you explicitly
aware of.

The right to document preex-
isting damage: As specified by the
Fair Housing Council, you have
the right to inspect and docu-

‘ ment any damage to the property

that exists prior to your tenancy.
Even if these damages do not af-
fect the safety or security of the
building, you might still want-
to make note or take a picture
of the damage. This will prove
that the said damages did not

Studentsopt to buy homes 

By Mary Mallampalli
, Staﬁ Writer T . ~

o

For most young adults, buying a house for

the ﬁrst time is a major life milestone —‘— a
milestone that, by the time some Pitt stu-
dents receive their diplomas, they’ll already
have reached. . ’

' Today, more and more parents are choos-
ing to purchase homes oncollege campuses
for, their children rather than paying thou-
sands of dollars each year for apartments
and dorms, according to a 2011 survey from
Coldwell Banker Real Estate. , _ ' _

A typical two-bedroom, one-bathroom
property in Oakland costs as little as $35,000

— and compared to paying up to $5,000 for '

a dorm room each semester over a four-year
period, it could be signiﬁcantly cheaperto
purchase an Oakland property and make

money back by renting spare rooms out to .

other students. According to the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau, the “ - — '

we bought our own place?’ And it worked
out well.’’ ‘ '

Muir said that, although he will graduate
at the end‘Q>f the year, he plans to continue
renting out the condo to trustworthy Pitt
friends.

_ Matt DiFiore, a recent Pitt graduate with
degrees in history and political science, con-
tinues to live in a house owned by two of his
college friends. But although his roommates
also serve as his landlords, DiFiore said the
"new relationship hasn’t put a strain on their
friendship.

“It was ‘actually very comfortable,”
DiFiore said. “Everything was great. We
worked out everything so that we’Ve had
an enjoyable time.” ; v

Thlejuliet Street house is owned byjason
and Daniel Furente, two brothers who pur-

chased the property three years ago to cut -

down their collective living costs. b
“We bought our house my sophomore
year. The reason why we bought it was

median value
of an owner-
occupied home
in Pittsburgh is
$83,100, and
52.1 percent
of Pittsbur-
ghers own their
homes.

In October

_“We bought our ~
ownhouse my

, sophomore year.”
-Jason‘ Furente

coming to Pitt too,” senior
Jason Furente said.

Rather than /putting
two kids through college
and paying twice the rent
forfour years, Furente’s
family decided it would
be ﬁnancially wiser to
purchase a house for the
two brothers.

2010, *Pitt se-
nior Kevin Muir ,
became the ‘owner of an Oakland condo.

_ Although Muir’s mother paid the down pay-

ment and signed the deed, the industrial
engineering major is responsible for much
more than just his studies. . _

‘-‘I’m in charge of collecting the rent from

‘ my roommates and maintaining the whole’

place. As far as paying the mortgage and the
insurance and everything, my mom covers
that. Tha_t’s what our rent goes towards,”
Muir said. I ’ A

The student landlord is also responsible

for ﬁlling the house each semester and mak-
ing sure all’ utilities are working properly,
responsibilities normally fulﬁlled by a stu-

- dent’s landlord. Muir has had different ten-
~ ants live in the condo since he purchased it

over a year ago.

“Other than the money part and "the
bills, I’m in charge of everything else,” Muir
said. ' ‘

Muir currently lives with two of his
friends in his Ward Street condominium,
both of whom he knew and trusted prior to
becoming their landlord. And although own-
ing his own place comes with a great deal

_of responsibility, Muir said purchasing the ~

condo was in his best ﬁnancial interest.
“There are always college kids looking
for places to live,” Muirsaid. “People are
paying up to $600 a month to live -7 that’s
$5400 a year to live. I just started crunching
numbers and said, ‘What would happen if

it’s in fact cheaper to -buy
a house than to go rent an apartment or
go through the Uriiversity,” the elder Fur-
ente, a computer engineering major, said.
“Besides, if we sellthis place, we’ll get the
money back.” 1 -

After the family purchased the house,
Jason Furente asked DiFiore, who had lived
on his dorm ﬂoor freshman year, if he would
be interested in renting from him.

“I_ knew he was an upstanding guy and
wouldn’t punch a hole through my wall
or something like that. When youvown a
house, that’s something that you have to
deal wit, .” '

The Furente brothers split the landlord '

responsibilities evenly to ensure-that all
housing issues are taken‘ care of —— one

’ brother takes care of the ﬁnances and col-

lects the rent from DiFiore, and the other

is responsible for maintenance and upkeep V ‘

of the house. . ‘ '

“Any issues with the house quickly get

taken care of, and checks are handled

' promptly for rent,” DiFiore said.

Although the senior Furente and Daniel,
a junior, will soon have graduated from Pitt,
they plan to keep the house. DiFiore is the

‘only tenant they’ve had thus far, but Fur-

ente said they’re deﬁnitely still interested
in looking for other roommates.

“I kind of like it here. It may be a while
later that we sell it back,” Furente said.

Insurance covers rentals

By Parthena Moisiadis
“ For The Pitt News

When Pitt junior Wesley Washington re-
turned to his North Oakland apartment last
year after winter break, he discovered a few
things missing.
‘fsomeone broke into our house and stole
a TV and video games,” Washington said.
Soon after, Washington contacted a rep-
resentative from his renter’s insurance agen-
cy who sent him a check
to replace his valuables-
Washington said that,
especially after this inci-
dent, he Will continue to
invest in coverage. ‘
But» not all Pitt stu-
dents sign up for renter’s
insurance when making
the move off campus.
The investment is volun-
tary on some leases, but,
if choosing to make the
monthly payment, a stu-
dent can expect coverage
for personal property, the ’
apartment itself and any
injuries that occur on the
rented property. .

In addition to insuring personal property,
a basic renter’s insurance policy should cover
damage to property, including damage due
to instances of ﬁre, lightning, windstorms,

smoke, vandalism, theft or discharge of h "

water.

Hutchins advised students to think about
the security deposit that renters pay at the

T beginning of their lease. If damage

is done to the property, no matter

the cause, renters will usually not
receive their security-deposit back
from the landlord. ' _, .

purchase insurance as a condi-

Dorms are a luxury offeredvto about 44
percent of Pitt students. ‘

“Get ready to see the scam,” junior _Fola
Arowolo said, walking to his apartment in
Ruskin Hall. The scam to which he refers is
the big price and small space of his Ruskin
apartment.

According to the College Board, 55
percent of undergraduates at Pitt live off.

campus. But Arowolo has stayed in the ,

dorm, though it gives him plenty of room
to complain.

Arowolo’s:biggest grievance, he said, is
signing in visitors. It’s a long and, in some
states of mind, cumbersome, procedure.
Ruskin, like all other on—campus dorms, also
enforces a rule that you can’t sign in more
than three people at once, a rule Arowolo
ﬁnds very annoying. .

Additionally, “Getting mail is a hassle,”
Arowolo said. “I have to go all the way down
to Towers to pick it up. Ifl lived in South
Oakland, I could have it delivered to my
door.” 1 »

. But Ruskin has its redeeming qualities
as well. -

“The location is prime,” Arowolo said,

Ruskin is situated close to several science
buildings. As a biology major, Arowolo can
practically roll out of bed_and into class.

The junior also said that he likes the
freedom of not having a Resident Assis-
tantand theconvenience of a kitchen in
his apartment.

But despite his long stay in the dorms,
Fola said he is looking for an off-campus
apartment next year.

For junior Emily Smith, the move to
South Oakland this year has proved a good
decision —— it has provided her with some of

the peace and quiet that she craves.

Smith lamented her experience in Bou-
quet Gardens last year, where all of her
neighbors where loud, drinking boys. At her
new place on Dawson Street, her neighbors
are older people who keep the partying at a
neighborly level.

Smith also ﬁnds it convenient that ‘her
landlord lives right across the street. He
shovels her sidewalk and ﬁxes anything that
might break. -

“Once, when a fuse broke, he was over

“ ea

 

within 10 minutes,” Smith said.

Smith said her commute time to class this
year is notvery different than it was from
Bouquet Gardens ¢—— about 10 minutes —
and her rent is a lot cheaper.

She also lives close to her parents in us.
Monroeville, so her food and laundry are
generally taken care of by them.

Smith enjoys, her Dawson Street apart-
ment so much that she plans to renew her
lease for next year.

True winter weather is taking aslow march

students renting housing-off campus will
continue to rise. V  » , ,

heating methods, the goal is not to break
the bank. Gas bills, which can include costs
for things like heat and stove usage, can run
students anywhere from $40 to $100 in the
winter, depending on the size of the house
and its residents’ preferred temperature.

Sometimes the best defense against high
heating bills is to simply rent a smaller piece
of property. That’s the method sophomore
Alex O’Neill adhered to when choosing
to rent a place in Webster Hall on North
Dithridge Street.

' “It’s only two bedrooms. It’s not a large
place,” O’Neill said. “A small place is ideal
to heat.” ,

Larger rental properties pose a greater
challenge for students hoping to keep their
heating bills low. Pitt senior Kayla Minor

During a stint in the U.S. Air Force, For-

coldest place he ever spent a winter in was
at the Sembach Air Base in Germany. When
it comes to winter not—so-wonderlands, For-
sythe said Pittsburgh matches Sembach’s
frigidness to aT.

“It’s exactly the same,” he said. .

Forsythe practices a two-word solution

Pros,cons of coed living

By Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

Call me old—fashioned, but when I was young-
er I assumed that when I enrolled in college
I would live with a bunch of other girls and
that we would bond and have sleepovers and
talk about boys and be best friends forever
in o.ur own little girl—World.

Then I arrived at Pitt, where I lived in a
coed dorm,just a few staircases above mul-
tiple ﬂoors of boys. Since that experience,
I’ve realized that choosing whether to‘ live
with the opposite sex — if you’re offered the
choice — depends largely on your tempera-
ment and opinions. Some people can and
will live in coed situations, and some people
can’t and won’t. I

I, like most students, had a naive impres-
sion of what coed living would entail. My
parents’ memories of same-sex dorms —~ as
well as various old TV shows and movies
— led me to assume that living near the

opposite sex would be detrimental. I don’t

think I can even specify why I had negative
expectations for coed living, but because
adults looked down upon it, I did too.

In some ways, their suspicions were well-

; ‘ founded. According to a 2009 study in the

Journal of American College Health, about
90 percent of college dorms are_now coed,
though many. universities, like Pitt, still offer
a single’-sex housing option. Although to the
incoming freshman a coed dorm might seem

like the ultimate independent college experi-
ence, it’s not without its downsides. A
The study surveyed 510 students, 87
percent of which lived in coed dorms. Of
that percentage, 41.5 percent reported
weekly binge drinking, as opposed to the
much lower 17.6 percent that reported binge
drinking in single—sex housing. The study
also found that students were “more likely
to say they’d had a sexual partner in the past
year and more likely to think it’s all right: ‘for

A two people to get together for sex and not

necessarily expect anything further?”

Needless to say, coed dorms allow for
much more independence and experimenta-
tion than same-sex dorms. But although the
risks are higher in the former, coed living
‘also provides residents with an opportunity
to challenge themselves. Such an environ-
ment offers a more wel1—rounded living ex-
perience and heightens our understanding
of male—female dynamics.

Of course, given the proliferation of coed
dorms, students might only be able to choose
between the two living arrangements when
they move off campus — a decision that car-
ries its own unique considerations.

The main difference between living in a A A

co-ed dorm and a.co—ed apartment is that, in
the latter instance, you’re no longer_merely
within close vicinity of the opposite gender
— you’re in the same space. You have to
share a bathroom, a kitchen, a living room
and ‘everything you own.

This transition can be difﬁcult for many
students, as the differences between the two

genders become much.more pronounced ‘

—— boys, for instance, can be messy. Ten-
sions are sure to arise if one group of peo-
ple doesn’t wash the dishes, or if the other
decides to resort to.the cold shoulder in
response to something meanthat was said
a week ago. -
There’s_also the issue of privacy. Assum-
ing your roommates are friends and not
romantically involved, it could be poten-

tially awkward if, say, you walk in on your
opposite-gendered roommate in the shower.

. Or while he or she is changing clothes. These

are seemingly easy-to-avoid situations, but
mistakes happen. You never know when
your privacy will be interrupted, and those
interruptions can make your living situation
much more awkward.

On the other hand, havingboth gen-

ders in one household can help ease ten-_

sion between roommates, especially when
tempers ‘are high. Female roommates don’t
necessarily have to spend all their time with
their female counterparts, while guys don’t
necessarily have to spend all their time in
the testosterone—ﬁlled land of male room-
mates.

More than neatnessin 
good roomie relations

By Sarah Simkin ‘
Staﬂ’ Writer

In a perfect world, you would ﬁnd a room-
mate who never woke you up early or kept
you up late, never fought you for the remote
and wouldn’t dream of snacking on your

groceries. But although that isn’t the world‘

we live in and concessions must be made,
arranging a good living situation off campus
takes serious consideration. .

If everything goes horribly wrong, there
aren’t RAs or mediators to sort things out.
And signing a lease is a legal obligation that
could be tough to get out of.

“When you sign a lease [with a room-
mate], you become one entity. You become
responsible for each other, a single unit.”
said Kevin Stiles, manager of leasing and
support services for Pitt’s Oﬂice of 0ff-Cam-
pus Living. “I would say be proactive — do
everything reasonably possible to prevent
ﬁnding yourself in a bad lease situation.”

But with a few considerations, your
chances of ﬁnding’ that perfect roommate
are much higher. ‘

Roommates: Living with your best friends
might seem like a dream come true at ﬁrst.
You can spend all of your time together! But

 that means youfllbge spending all of your i
time together. Most-jiif us know someone or a

other who excitedlfisigned up to live with

his best friend and that ended the friendship.

right there. Being best friends does not equal
a perfectly harmonious living situation.

If you rule out living with your closest
friends, are you doomed to a life of singles
and efficiencies? Not necessarily. Before you
try your luck with Craigslist ~— or Pitt’s own
roommate—matching;website — consider
people you know reasonably well outside
the realm of your usual social circle.

_ Is there someone from work or a former
classmate you got along with well? Don’t be
skittish of coed housing possibilities either:
Provided there is no romantic tension (and
I really can’t stress enough how important
that is), sometimes a friend of the opposite
gender can make a great living partner.

Traits:aThe ﬁrst words that probably

spring into your mind as roommate attri?

butes, “neat” and “messy,” aren’t.simply
deﬁned terms. Maybe you haven’t seen your

bedroom ﬂoor in months, but your kitchen’

must be spotless at all times. Think about
how much shared living space you’ll have
and whether youand your roomieeto-be can

ﬁnd a‘ comfortable middle ground.

, Even if you both have the same neatness
levels, there are other factors to consider. If
one roommate studies all the time and needs
cluiet and the other is constantly hosting
shindigs and blasting loud music,’there’s a

good chance contention will arise. Consider '

whether your lifestyles will mesh well enough
for you to be constantly in proximity.

. Number: More people means costs are
more broadly divided, yes —— but at the price
of adding complexity and potential for con-

ﬂict with each new personality combination. 4

And with morepeople, there’s always the

risk of cliques and alliances forming — that ‘ E

additional: drama is unnecessary.

 ; Price,:,Before any apartment-hunting she- W

nanigans ensue, discuss what you wantand

how much: you can pay. If you’re scavenging’

for places in different neighborhoods and
ldiiferent price ranges, you’re going to have
a problem. As much as it might be tough, if
you’re not willing to compromise and your
friend can’t afford the same things you can,
the roomie relationship isn’t ideal. '
Ground rules: Nothing destroys a pleasant
living situation as devastatingly as passive
aggression —~ and that often springs up from
a miscommunication of expectations (i.e.,
doing your dishesright away versus putting
them in the sink until the end of the night).
Establish ground rules for the space as
soon as possible, ideally before you move
in. Consider discussing:

1. Who_will do what chores and when?

2. Who will be responsible for making sure
rent and utilities get paid on time?

13.‘ When is it OK to have guests over? How
many? What about overnight visitors? L

_ 4. Where is the line with romantic rela-
tionships? (Remember, signing a lease with
one person could mean getting stuck with
his signiﬁcantother regularly).

5. How do each of you feelabout hosting
parties or social events? I

He also advises that students replace
their furnace ﬁlters monthly during the
winter season, keep their hot water tanks
below the maximum temperature and take
advantage of sunny days by keeping the
blinds open, allowing natural heat to warm

TENANT RIGHTS    

FROM PAGE 7 I

occur during your lease term and ensure
that charges will not be taken out of your
security deposit.

The right to guests: As stated in the
Tenant- Landlord Handbook, you have the
privilege of inviting visitors and guests

into your space for a reasonable amount _

of time. Any damages to the building in-
curred by any visitors become the tenant’s
responsibility to fix. However, you are
absolutely prohibited from renting out
any of your leased space.

The right to repairs: You have the right
to request repairs from the landlord. If
these requests are not addressed in a
reasonable amount of .time,,you can then
contact the Department of Code Enforce-
ment eithertogterminate-the lease legally
or to make the repairs at your own expense
and take the expenses incurred out of the
rent balance. The Pennsylvania Landlord
and Tenant Act also addresses the notion
of withholding rent as a way to see that
repairs are made. If you find yourself in
this position, it is important that you be-
come familiar with the exact clauses that
relate to withholding payment or putting

rent in escrow funds. This can be found in

Section 25o.511a as well as in the Tenant-

. Landlord Handbook. But remember, dam-

ages caused by the tenant are the tenant’s

responsibility. For example, if you break ‘

an otherwise functional door knob, it is
your responsibility to replace said knob.
The right to basic needs outlined by
the Housing Code: According to the City
of Harrisburg Housing Code, whose man-
dates also apply to the city of Pittsburgh,
landlords are to provide tenants with the
following: ' ‘
' -Heat, between Oct. 1 and May 15
-Access to*hot and cold water .

—A roof that meets the Housing Code’s _

standards and does not leak
—Floors, stairs, handrails, windows,
screens anddoors which are in good con-
dition _ . V
-Extermination of insects and rodents:
It is important to note that if the renter
does not keep the property in a sanitary

_ must file a complaint against the landlord

at a district judge’s office.

Now with the mystery removed from

with the knowledge that will make you a
good tenant and allow you to hold your
landlord accountable for his role during

Letter to the editor I

To the Editor,

I am writing this letter in response to the
editorial published in The Pitt News onjan. 11
titled “Viral Video-Game Blog Post Unrelated
to LGBTQ Rights.” I think a serious oppor-
tunity to discuss the signiﬁcance of gender

roles and LGBTQ individuals was missed in‘

the article’s dismissal of the situation. When
I think of the moments when I have been
made aware of just how difficult my life as an
LGBTQ person would be, it was in moments
where my father said things to me like the
father mentioned in the editorial said. A large
part of homophobia is based on the desire to
strictly police gender expression. _, A ~
This extends not just to hobbies and so-

 Q ,cial interests, but to sexuality as well. Men
‘ shouldn’t want girl colors for the same reason

that they shouldn’t want to be in committed
relationships" with other men — that’s sup-
posed to be what women want. It’s not only
the more obvious issues such as discrimina-
tory laws that make LGBTQ lives hard, but

also the ways that teachers, employers, co- 1

workers, fellow students, friends and family
reinforce the idea that LGBTQ people are
somehow living incorrectly through their

‘seemingly inconsequential comments.
Because LGBTQ organizations (along with _

women’s groups and feminist activists) have
worked to dismantle these expectations of
gender, it makes this type of thing relevant
and of consequence to the larger movement.
I think the editorial —~ however well-inten-
tioned — does a disservice to the movement
it speaks of by suggesting gender roles aren’t
relevant to LGBTQ rights.

FROM PAGE I7

people won’t always be easy. As much as
you’d like to sit around all day in your loose,
unwashed sweatpants and watch reruns of
“Aqua Teen Hunger Force,” there are basic
chores that must be completed. For exam-
ple, do you know what happens if you don’t
wash the dishes for six months? They’ll start
to stink something ﬁerce and might even
become home to various insect colonies.
To prevent this nasty outcome — imagine
bringing a date back there, only to have him
or her lay eyes on a cesspool like that! ——

you and friends should try to wash the
dishes  bimonthly basis. Also, when the
garage or bonus room becomes completely
ﬁlled vile-smelling trash and clothing,
you should take stepsto remedy that prob-
lem. In clther words, you should throw that
crap outithe window and into the backyard

A (or street, depending on where the room

is located).

Heating is another important consider-

ation. In the winter, we recommend run-
ning the heat as little as possible. This is
a wonderful cost-saving measure, since it
will allow you to save money on your bills
and, once the cold causes your metabolism

to slow to a crawl, your daily food budget, ,

too. Thecolds and ﬂus that ﬂourish in such

an unhealthy environment will have the
happy effect of providing you with an end-
less stream of legitimate reasons for missing
so much class. Best of all, the polar climate
in your apartment will reduce your per-
spiration level, enabling you to wear the
same hoodie, sweats, underwear and socks
throughout the winter.

Finally, you’ll want to inaugurate your

I new life in this wonderful pad with a killer

party. Planning the party of the century of
the week is outside the scope of this column,
but here’s one neat trick for ensuring that
you wind up with the boppingest bash on the
block: Place an ad on the “Casual Encoun-
ters” section of Craigslist —_— what could be
more “casual” than a laid—back get—together

25

at your “baller” place, after all — listing the
time and address of the party and including
a note that the attendees at the eventwill
be “d2f” (that means “down to get funky”

in Internet code). You’re guaranteed to reel ‘

in some of the coolest cats in town, thereby
proving to yourself and everybody elsethat
there’s no place quite like home.

Don’t say we didn’t warn you, true be-
lievers. ﬂ
