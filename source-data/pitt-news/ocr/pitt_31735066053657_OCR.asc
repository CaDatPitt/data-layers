In a way that no photograph
can, poe_try captures the ﬂeeting
thoughts and feelings of a moment.
And in a way that no page can cap-
ture, presenting poetry on the stage

breathes new life into those
moments, according to Samuel
Hazo, founder of the International
Poetry Forum.

The Poetry Forum will open its
new season of readings with
Pulitzer Prize—winning writer
Richard Wilbur tomorrow night at
eight in the Carnegie Lecture Hall.

Besides winning two Pulitzer
Prizes, Wilbur has won a National
Book award and was inaugurated as
the second poet laureate of the
United States in 1987.

In the four decades since his
first volume of poetry, Wilbur has
translated plays; authored chil-
dren’s books", criticisms, and
essays; and has collaborated on the
lyrics for the comic opera Candide.
His reading marks the Forum’s 30th
season of presenting poetry as a
spoken art.

U.$. Poet Laureate Richard Wilbur will
speak at the Carnegie tomorrow.
Poetry Forum, surrounded on all
sides by walls heavy with books,
Hazo’s soft—spoken voice carries all
the emphasis and inﬂection of the
poetry around him.
p He said the forum was designed
to help poetry reach the ears of an
audience, instead of just their eyes.
“Poetry began as a bardic tradi-
tion, as an oral tradition,” Hazo
said. “People said poems long

 

before they were able to write them
or print them. The only reason a
poet has for writing down their
poetry is so that people can have it
after they’re dead and gone.”
While written poetry captures
the essence of a feeling, Hazo said
readings of a poem brings out

aspects of the words that can’t be

gotten from a text.

“Compare poetry to music,”
Hazo said. “Suppose I hold a sheet
of written music up, and say, ‘This
is music.’ A musician would say it’s
not music. It’s only music when
you hear it. The same thing applies
to poetry.” \

During its 30 years, the Poetry
Forum has brought more than 800
poets and actors to Pittsburgh to
illustrate the oral tradition of the art
form. .

“We get poets who are famous,
who’ve won awards, but we’ve also
brought in people who’ve only had
one book published,“ .Hazo said.
“We pick writers because they’re
good, because they’re genuine.”

The Forum also sponsors actors
such as James Earl Jones, Gregory
Peck, and Danny Glover to give

Students see giant balloons, but no message

Students jousted and rock-
climbed their way to a chance at win-
ning a new 1997 car at the Health and
Fitness Tour in front of the William
Pitt Union yesterday.

The main goal of the Collegiate
Health and Fitness "Tour is to teach
students to be more conscious of their
physical conditioning, says Ken
Gistedt, the health and fitness tour
director.

With the health lesson came a
number of free handouts.

“We’ve already given a day’s sup-
ply of give-aways in half a day,” said
Gistedt, referring to the booth set up
beside the giant blué condom balloon.

The booth boasted deodorant,
whitening toothpaste, and the much
talked-about free condom samples,
displayed beside each other in that

WEATHER

    
 

order.

“The first thing to go was actual-
ly the deodorant. A lot of students are
picking up condoms, —-the AIDS
message [must be] getting across,”
Gistedt added.

The booth swarmed with females,
but males picked equally as many
condoms. The approach of the sexes
is what differed. Women would actu-
ally go up and ask for the condoms
without being bashful while men
tended to have more of a macho act
when picking up the samples, said
Gistedt.

This is the fourth year Pitt has
been included in the tour. The main
sponsors are Jeep, Eagle and Bacchus
— an alcohol awareness organization
established on 750 campuses across
the country. Each school year, the
Health and Fitness Tour visits 100
campuses across the country.

Some students argue that the tour

is more an advertisement ploy than a C

public service by the companies that
sponsor the games. All around the
booths, bright bold letters advertise
each sponsor, from a blow-up plastic
bottle of Clearly Canadian to Details
magazine for young men.

“The giant condom balloon really
sticks out, “ said Blake Fox,.a junior
in psychology. “I also noticed that the
only four events that everyone is
doing are the ones the American
Gladiators do, like rock-climbing and
jousting — the ones they’re familiar
with from TV.” .

Mike Ibenthal, a representative
from Intercollegiate Communication,
Inc., the producers of the event, tend-
ed the Details magazine booth. “We
hope that students take a look around.
The Student Health Service has a lot
of information for the students,” said
Ibenthal. “Some students just come

JERUSALEM —— Today, President
Clinton continues his efforts to end the
current Middle East crisis and create
peace in the area.

A White House summit called by
President Clinton will occur today
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. This comes in the wake of the
Israeli reopening of an archaeological tun-
nel near Muslim holy places in
Jerusalem’s Old City — the same issue
that started the ﬁghting in the first place.

President Clinton said that the two
leaders have expressed a desire to create
peace and resolve this crisis. Cox News

SEOUL, South Korea — Ofﬁcials said
Monday that a U.S.-led consortium has

North Korea has allegedly been using the

The month—long talks ended only
after both sides agreed on higher wages
for the North Koreans working on-the new
power plants. These two new reactors will
completely replace communist North

CWO registers voters and
educates about safe sex

Carole Lynn Gerlock

 

Some people claim politics is
better than sex, and the Campus
Women’s Organization sought to use

9"’, interest in one to raise interest in the

other.

The Campus Women’s
Organization (CWO) had a table at
the William Pitt Union last Friday to
raise awareness of the importance of
voting and safer sex.

“We wanted to make people
aware of how important it is to take
a stand on issues that affect college
students and thought this was the
best way to do this,” Margot
Douaihy, co—president of CWO said.

Laura Baldwell, the publicity
chair for the group, received 500
condoms and informational pam-
phlets on AIDS from the AIDS task
force to distribute to those who were

‘ interested and registered to vote.

At first the group did not receive
a warm welcome. But according to
the CWO, as the day went on peo-
ple seemed to respond pleasantly.

“Right after we set up a man

 

came over and said his son told him
what we were doing and he decided
to take a look for himself. The
father said he didn’t approve in
what we were doing, and in his day
when you registered to vote you
were given a Bible not a condom,”
Douaihy said.

Douaihy said that while the man
had a right to his opinion, as times
change people have to become
aware of the issues at hand and
stand up for what they believe in.

“If we can save one life and
have people take interest in impor-
tant issues, then volunteering our
time doing this makes it worth it,”
Douaihy said.

Besides giving out condoms, the
group also made hotline numbers
available for those who need infor-
mation about AIDS, drug abuse, and
contraception.

Anyone wanting additional
information about these issues can
call the Public Health Services at 1-
800—342—AIDS, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse at 1-800-
662-HELP, or Emergency
Contraception at 1-800-584-9911.

violations against the Kurds. _

“We put pickpockets in jail and yet
Saddam Hussein is allowed to go free,”
King said. “The more we ratify his
behavior by inaction the more likely this
type of behavior will be repeated.”

Benjamin Ferencz discussed how he
became personally involved with the
setup of the trials before the war was
over. '

Ferencz said he enlisted in the U.S.
Army after graduating from Harvard
Law School in 1943, and was transfered
to the newly created U.S. War Crimes
Plans, a program created to gain an
understanding of Nazi crimes and cap-
ture war criminals.

As part of a team of investigators,
Ferencz inspected concentration camps
near the end of the war.

“I was in many concentration
camps,” Ferencz said. “I have dug up
bodies with my hands and I have seen
man’s inhumanities against man.”

After World War 11, Ferencz‘

returned to the United States where he
was asked to serve on the American
prosecuting team for the War Crimes
Tribunal at Nuremberg.

He discussed the creation of a per-
manent international court, one that
could try individuals and pierce the
political ‘shield their countries afford

 

them.

Ferencz said a permanent tribune to
judge war criminals would eliminate
many of the doubts raised about impar-
tiality and effectiveness of past tribunes.

Critics of an international law say
the tribunals are simply a case of the vic-
torious prosecuting the defeated, the
powerful punishing the weak. But
Ferencz said consistency in international
law would eliminate the problem of
determining who is to be tried and who
isn’t.

He argued that a permanent intema-
tional tribune would have prosecuted the
United States for its inhumanitarian
involvement in the mines of Nicaragua,
in Ferencz’s mind, “a clear case of
aggression by the U.S.”

One of his personal interests is
Yugoslavia, and he said the permanent
and independent tribunal must be set up
to prevent future dictatorships like the
one established there.

Ferencz said he believes the catalyst
for change lies in the fortitude of the
young.

“You can’t just wait for a better
world to come to you, you have to earn
it,” Ferencz said. “I want to give the
young people three pieces of
advice...never give up, never give up,
never give up.”

readings of the works of dead poets.

“It’s not easy to read someone
else’s work,” Hazo said. “Some
actors can’t do it. They can’t read it
if they tried. Others are very good at
it.”

The most important job poetry
has is to be heard and read in public,
according to Hazo. “The language
that we hear everyday is grammati-
cal language,” he said. “lt’s the lan-
guage of prose, or music broadcast,
radio broadcasts. You don’t get any-
thing out of it, you just absorb it,
you sponge it in.”

Hazo said the only “poetic
break” some people get from the
media comes through advertise-

 

  

 

THE PITT NEWS

ments.

“Advertisers uses poetic tech-
niques,” he said. “They have
rhythm, and rhyme: ‘See the U.S.A
in your Chevrolet.’ That’s not acci-
dental, but it’s done to sell
Chevrolet, to sell toilet paper, to sell
any damn thing.”

Hazo said the difference
between real poetry and the “poetic
technique” is the substance of the
writing.

Quoting a line from Robert
Frost, Hazo said, “A vital sentence
is a sentence you can’t forget if you
try, a grammatical sentence is just a
correctly punctuated sentence.” He
said poetry in any genre of writing is

made up of those “vital sentences.”

“A vital sentence captures the
essence of a moment forever. That’s
poetry,” Hazo said. “It just springs
from the imagination.”

Besides being president of the
Forum, Hazo is a professor at
Duquesne University, and has also
had many books, plays, and poetry
collections of his own published.
Two years ago, he was inaugurated
as the first Poet Laureate of
Pennsylvania.

“There’s no real job description
for that,” Hazo said, with a smile.

Hazo said the Poetry forum will
continue to. bring writers and actors
in to Pittsburgh for readings
throughout the year. It also sponsors
free “Poets-at-High Noon” readings

of their dorms and stop drinking and
get high on life —— instead of destroy-
ing their lives.”

Ben Hartline, a Pitt junior, hap-
pened to be in Gettysburg recently
when the Health and Fitness Tour vis-
ited the campus there. He said, “Their
big thing was promoting natural
highs.”

“It provided my exercise for the
day,” Hartline said.

A group of students standing by
said they wanted to make sure that
they ‘ got their free condoms. This
seemed to be the general interest
among the wandering students.

When asked what free gifts he was
going ‘for, Nate McWilliams, a’ junior
in health information management
replied, “The condoms. Oh, and the
water bottle.”

McWil1iams said that it looked to
him like the booths were just one big
advertisement.

“I don’t see a whole lot of health-
oriented things,” said McWilliams.

The Pittsburgh Stop, an outside
vendor, situated on the corner of
Forbes and Bigelow, appreciated the
business generated by the tour. Said
one salesman, “Anybody that comes
around here affects our business.”

Today will be the last day of the
Health and Fitness Tour, ending its
two-day visit.

ig man on campus The student body or corporate America?

Beware Greeks bearing gifts...

Here on the fourth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union, our enjoy-
ment of an unfettered View of our
favorite oasis, Ferlo Park, has
been marred by the Jeep and
Eagle Health and Fitness Tour on
the Union lawn. Fairs can be nice,
and we all must admit to having
gotten a kick out of the giant con‘-
dom, but this was simply another
attempt to lure us in with glossy
images and games so that we can
get some more corporate hooks
put i'nto*us. , -

At this" University, we are
already bombarded with people
offering us free stuff with the
intention of having us pay for it
later, whether it be through get-
ting an American Express Card or
using Pearl Drops to keep our
smiles dazzlingly white.
Everyday, there is someone either
standing in front of or in the bot-
tom of the Union with offers of
free t—shirts as they try to con-
vince you to get a long-distance
calling card.

This time, the only difference
is that they lured us in with large
blow-up toys, games, and free
condoms as they tried to indoctri-
nate us with the ‘desire to buy

what they were hawking.

Where is the line between
academia and corporate America?
Aren’t we supposed to be safe
from corporate brainwashing
while trying to fill our heads with
— gasp ‘— knowledge?

This line has been become
more and more faint and blurred
lately with the advent of the new
American Express-sponsored IDs
and the continuous string of mar-
keting ploys disguised as fairs,
supposedly for such altruistic pur-
poses as promoting our health and

fitness. If this fair were simply to .

promote our health and fitness,
would the giant condom have
been a billboard for Trojans?
Would the toothpaste have been
Pearl Drops? The deodorant, Arrid
Extra Dry? Or would it have sim-
ply been information on the uses
of these products and the healthy
and hygienic lifestyle they are a
part of, rather than advertisements
of specific brands?

It is about time that we ques-
tioned the motivations behind
these “free give-aways” ‘we are
being offered. Are they’ really
free, or are they just selling us up
the river?

Justgimme some truth

._.‘._.

    

Truth is a funny thing. So funny, per-
haps, that nobody likes to tell it. We all
have ideas of what truth means to us, but
do we really give thought to what it is on a
global level or its importance pertaining to
all things? Various deﬁnitions of this eso-
teric term seem to arise in everyday
speech. Some call it an indisputable fact
and others abuse the term by calling it sub-
jective. We tend to overlook its importance
and pure essence.

Truth can be both subjective and
objective. It is subjective in the sense that
we are creatures of sense. The Scottish
philosopher David Hume felt that all
knowledge is derived from sense experi-
ence. If all that we think comes from these
imperfect reality detectors, can truth be in
existence at all? We cannot as living, func-
tioning beings accept that, as rational as it

may ‘sound. An existence where the entire

world is understood to be a‘ created reality,
is fairly useless, and can produce nothing
but inaction. '

Truth, as we know it, is run on the
best approximation of an entity existing

- elsewhere (i.e. an objective, indisputable

truth). Plato would have called it the fonn
of truth, a measuring stick for all true
things to be compared with. Despite the
unscientiﬁc nature of this tenet, it is neces-
sary that we think this way. Because our
reality is contrived by our senses, every
truth that we hold is what a mystic would
call faith. There is no difference between
Newtonian physics, Greek mythology, and
Christianity. Society is just playing a dif-
ferent tune these days. We pray to the gods
of Einstein and Plank, and before that, the

"mythology of Newtonian Physics. Sure,

Newton was wrong, but it sure was a hell
of a great way of looking at the world (or
at least our little corner of it). The gods of
Newton built our buildings, and ﬁred our
projectiles, they were nothing if not useful.
The same goes for the religions of the
world. -It is just that the physics of Newton
and Galileo have worn out their welcome

in the land of “truth,” to make room for the
more comprehensive tenets of Quantum
Mechanics. Soon that too will be a wistful
mythological memory. Pieces of Newton,
Da Vmci, and all religions of the world still
reside in the transient part of truth town,
because they are still the most simple and
useful ways of describing the universe.
This strikes a chord that seems to be vibrat-
ing loudly enough to hear the answer.

Faith brings us out of our dilemma of
inaction by being useful, and terribly so.
All of science, all of religion, and all of
life, are based on a simple concept called
faith. This is a world where the truth can-
not be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt
and the search for this squirmy little fellow
leaves us in a sluggish brain cramp. Faith
may be a way to exact a sensible existence.
Faith is a bold trust of unsure principles
that have a knack of describing the world
very well. The truly “scientiﬁc” way
would be agnosticism (in a “doubting all
knowledge” sense of the word), but where
is the fun in that? Where is the action and
fortitude? Where are our "buildings, our
cars, our emotions, our homes, our friends
and our gods without faith? VV1thout faith
they reside in a limbo where their very
existence is questioned. VV1th faith, they
reside in the land of truth, if only for a brief
stay, and besides, the hospitality is much
better this side of the existential plane.

There is another truth of which I
speak. While we question the outside
world, there is something else that we can
know on a much higher level (i.e. our-
selves). Humans have the uncanny ability
of introspection. Hindsight is 20/20. We
can know ourselvesfar better than external
observation allows us to know the world.
We have a responsibility to ourselves and
to society to know ourselves. It is for our
own beneﬁt. True happiness carmot come
under false pretenses. If our knowledge of
ourselves is based on false pretenses, we
suffer disastrous consequences and chalk
up our misfortime to bad luck, despite the
perfectly explainable reasons waiting to be
discovered.

Two days before President Clinton was
to arrive in the Pittsburgh area, I received a
call from one of the members of the White
House Advance Team. She asked ifI would
be interested in driving in the presidential
motorcade. I was ecstatic. How many peo-
ple have the opportunity to drive a vehicle
in a presidential motorcade? Not many.
Therefore I responded with an enthusiastic,

- “Yes, I would be happy to drive.”

On the morning of Wednesday, Sept.
25, the day when President Clinton was
scheduled to give a speech at Robert Monis
College, I rolled out of bed at six in the
morning and told myself that driving in
Clinton’s motorcade was a good reason to
get up so early. I got ready, caught a bus
downtown, met the carpool, and went to the
Air Force base where President Clinton was
to arrive.

As I stepped onto the base, I knew that

this was going to be one of the most trea-

sured memories of my college years. At
eight in the morning, mobs. of Secret
Service agents in their dark suits, sleek
shades, cropped hair, and stone-faced
expressions, Pittsburgh police in their blue
and white uniforms sitting atop motorcy-
cles, state troopers in their sombre brown
attire and trademarlg peaked hats, and Air
Force personnel in uriiforrn were all moving
rapidly to complete the missions assigned to
them. '

I was given the keys to a Chevrolet
Lurnina minivan (obviously the vehicles in
the motorcade had to be made in America)
and was told to pop the hood and trunk,
open all doors and windows, and move out
of the way. To my astonishment, bomb dogs
were brought to the van to sniﬂ for suspi-
cious items. At this time, I began to think
that maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.
Bomb dogs and Secret Service agents can
do that to you. After that episode, all motor-
cade drivers were taken to a private room so
the Secret Service could check our personal
belongings and walk us through a highly
sensitive metal
detector. I never
knew there were so
many ways to trans-
form a camera into
an explosive device.

We were then
whisked back to the
awaiting vans and
driven towards Air
Force One. All I
could think about was what an incredible
story this would be to tell to my family and
friends back home. The motorcade came to
a complete stop in frontof the enormous
plane, and President Clinton walked out of
the plane and entered a limousine. I also
received my passengers. I was driving the
oﬂicial White House video photographers,
those people who take pictures to be placed
in the archives for posterity. One was a
stalmch Clinton supporterand the other 

    

well let’s just say his greatest memories
were of good old Ronnie and George Bush.

This was where the fun began. We exit-
ed the Air Force base and started to go fast
— really fast. I guess that’s a rule in presi-
dential motorcades. All side roads were
blocked to prevent outside vehicles from
entering, and we took full advantage of that.
I had to keep reminding myself NOT to
stop at stop signs or trafﬁc lights (that’s the

last time that will happen). All along the-

route, people were gathered to wave to the
president.
We pulled up to the auditorium, our
— - passengers exited,
and I thought to
myself that that had
to have been the
greatest driving
experience of my
life. I parked the
car, leaned back
into the driver’s
seat, and relaxed.
Just as I was clos-
ing my eyes, I heard a knock at the window
and was infonned that the motorcade dri-
vers would be given the opportunity to meet
the president after the completion of his
speech. A feeling of awe came over me. I
jumped out of the car, strode over to the
other drivers, took a few pictures of the
President’s limo, and anxiously waited.
We were ushered into a back room and
stood in a serni-circle. Some people prac-
ticed their handshake and what they were

going to say, others chatted nervously
amongst themselves, and I stood there won-
dering how in the world I had been picked
for this event. Then, President Clinton
walked into the room. A hushed silence fell
over everyone. He walked to the ﬁrst person
in line and shook his hand while a photog-
rapher took a picture and advanced down
the line, coming closer to me. The ﬁrst thing
I noticed about him was how big he was. He
was like a football player —- tall, broad
shoulders, big build, very powerful looking,
and he was rapidly making his way towards
me. Before I knew it, he was standing
before me with his hand extended. I reached
out and accepted his handshake. I looked up
and said softly, “it’s an honor to meet you,
Mr.President,” and he smiled, probably
having heard that line millions of times. I
looked at his face ~— he looked tired — and
then the photographer’s camera ﬂashed and
he was gone, on to the next person.

I look back on my motorcade experi-
ence and regret not having said something
more creative or profound to the president
What really made an impact on me were the
people, the motorcade drivers, the volun-
teers, the people standing alongside the
motorcade route holding signs and cheer-
ing. They were all participating in the elec-
tion process and the government of their
country. I realized that Bill Clinton is just a
man. Granted, he may be a powerful man,
but he is just a man. I saw all those people
lining the streets and I felt like shouting,

What I’m about to discuss may
not apply to everyone, though it
seems like such a common problem
among my friends and acquain-
tances that I’m starting to think it’s
universal.

I’m talking about dating, or

rather, the lack of it on this campus. .

In my third year here at Pitt, 1, like
most of the people I know, have to
ask the student body this question:
Why have we all become so inept at
“the date?”

Let’s take a typical first date, for
example. The scenario is too famil-
iar — you meet a guy or girl and
start talking. You exchange phone
numbers and agree to get together
the following weekend. You wait all
week for the phone call, and when it
ﬁnally arrives, the conversation
goes something like this:

(Little small talk intro, then...)

“So, what are you up to
tonight?”

“Well, my friends are talking
about going to the bar. What about
you guys?”

“Yeah, I think everyone here is
heading there, too. So, I guess I’ll
see you there.”

Right?

When the “big date” ﬁnally

THE Pl'I"l' NEWS

Courtship: an out-of-date tradition?

arrives, you run into this person
you’ve waited all week to see in the
most unromantic enviromnent ever
-—- a sweaty, overcrowded meat
market with 311 blasting from the
speakers and your drunken friends
spilling quarter drafts all over both
of you. You could spend hours
doing your hair or deciding on an
outﬁt, but it wouldn’t make a differ-
ence. Within an hour of arrival to
this “dating wonderland,” you ﬁnd
yourself sweat— and beer—soaked,
looking and smelling worse than
you would have if you had come
straight from nmning a marathon
and then sleeping for a week.

Still, you make the best of it.
You try to hold a conversation, buy
each other drinks, and (depending
on where you are) maybe even
dance a little. By the end of the
night, you and your “date” are both
so wrecked and stupid that, suppos-
ing one of you can still speak coher-
ently, the timely question now sur-
faces:

“Your place or mine?”

Sweeps you off your feet, does
n’t it? I

What happened to ﬂowers,
movies, and candlelight dinners?
What happened to meaningful con-
versations and good-night kisses?
I’ll tell you what happened — we
never gave them a chance. Most of

us have become so accustomed to
this twisted form of dating that we
expect nothing more.

Sure, bars are ftm, and it’s nice
to ease that ﬁrst—date tension by
going to a place where most of your
friends will be. But shouldn’t a ﬁrst
date be a tad more special than, say,
every night you’ve had at college
thus far? I’m not asking for ﬁre-
works here, but a tiny spark might
be nice once in a while.

The way I see it, dating has

become an anachronism to a gener-
ation that should be making the
most of it. At this age, we should be
pros at the date; we should have
enough experience under our belts
to feel conﬁdent about it. Yet most
of us won’t ever really learn how to
date until we’re rniddle-aged,
divorced, and facing the “singles
scene” again. We will be miserable
and probably scared to death
because we never learned how to
date when we had the chance. I
mean, really, if I ﬁnd myself single
again at 40, and I meet the man of
my dreams, I don’t think I’ll be ask-
ing him to meet my friends and me
at Peter’s for $3 pitchers. Call me
crazy.

Truth

Ignorance is not bliss. By perpetuating ignorance we
distance ourselves from people in an irreparable manner, and
we are deﬁned by what they think we are. Which is better, a
meaningless facade of happiness, or truth and extreme rnis—
fortune? Ignorance is stagnating, but from truth and rnisfor—
time, the only way is up. _

So is faith happiness under false pretenses? Real faith is
almost entirely based on probability and reason, whereas
personal lies are a self—defense mechanism designed to avoid
conﬂict that may be necessary. Faith is not a lie, it is an
approximated truth, and there is a difference. Faith does not
demean our search for truth, it facilitates it. It is a tool.
Where would Einstein be without the foundations of
Newton and Newton without Galileo? So have faith, but
always question, and always search. The only danger of
faith, or any school of thought is sticking to a particular one
for too long.

Jay DeMartino is a cowardly agnostic who thinks that fore-
sight is legally blind.

October's for

 grass and ball

 

Ahhhh, October. Cool air, apple
cider, the World Series, the NHL 
yes, the NHL.

The conﬂict between sports and
meteorology has produced memorable
moments throughout time, from the
“Ice Bowl” NFL championship game
to that Little League game when I had
to be our catcher the whole game and it
was about 150 degrees in the shade.
But, the NHL goes too far. i

The only thing ‘more ridiculous
than playing ice hockey in the first
week of October is playing ice hockey
in the middle of May, which is when
the playoffs generally end. Even in a
place like Edmonton, home of cold
Canadian air masses and maybe a few
Eskimos, it’s not snowing yet.

By comparison, the NBA (whose
season is also far too long, but we’ll
talk about them next month) has a
sport that can be played year-round.
They don’t start until a month later.

Nobody cares about hockey now.
The baseball season isn’t even over
yet. The high temperature in Pittsburgh
yesterday was supposed to be 72
degrees. Everybody knows. meteorolo-
gists are wrong almost as often as
sports writers, but it doesn’t take a
genius to tell that you can’t have ice in
this weather.

For a change, this problem has an
easy solution: shorten the season.
Remember a few years ago when that
strike cut the season in ha1f?‘I didn’t
think you would. Nobody noticed. The
shortened regular season did nothing to
hurt the NHL. Have every team play
about 60 games instead of 82. Would

a you care if the Penguins played 30

home games this year instead of 40?
Would you notice the difference? Let’s
give October back to baseball, where it
belongs.

ers that “Mr: October? was NOT a

Buffalo stampedes
women’s soccer

 

The Pitt Women’s soccer
team traveled to Buffalo,
N.Y. this weekend to take on
the Lady Royals of the
University of Buffalo. Not
only did the Lady Panthers

have to battle their oppo-«

nents, but they also battled
the weather on a dark and
stormy night with high
winds. This contributed to
one Buffalo goal and some
of the sloppy play.

Vanessa Madison gave
Pitt the early advantage three
minutes into the match when
she directed a -shot past

-Royals’ keeper, Joanne
Chillingsworth. The
University of Buffalo

answered just 1.10 later with
a breakaway goal by Nicole
Tresino with an assist from
Kathleen Magner. .

The Royals took control
of the game for good at the
18-minute mark. Magner
scored her only goal of the
night off a comer kick that
got up in the wind and ﬂoat-
ed behind Pitt netminder
Sarah Stout. Kelly Starchok
scored her ﬁrst goal of the
game. just four minutes later

. the last goal of the game for

on another assist from
Magner. She shot it to the
low comer to beat Stout and
give the Lady Royals a 3-1

The Lady Panthers made
the game interesting late in
the first half after Madison
scored her second of the
game off a set play to makeit
3-2. .

But the University of

pounced on the Lady .

about the outcome of this

Lacrosse struggles
at UMBC tourney

:-'. .-51:.-.<-:35 .75;-M: av:-.-:-:‘ 95:9?

The men’s lacrosse team

traveled to the University of
Maryland over the weekend
for a 'toumament and lost
three of four games. Don’t let
the three losses mislead,
because the games against
Salisbury State and the
University of Maryland at
Baltimore County were both
one-goal losses.

Pitt lost its opening game
to Salisbury, 7-6 in overtime.
In this match, the referees
negated three potential Pitt
goals.

"Ihey made three bad
calls on balls that hit the post,”
said coach Gary Neff. “They
hit the inside of the goal posts,
which is a goal. We should
have won this game.”

After barely losing to one
of the best teams at the tour-
nament, Pitt dominated
Loyola of Maryland 4-1. Pitt’s
defense was superb in shut-
ting down a skilled olfense.

“I was impressed with
the defense. Brian Novotny
made a physical presence
with some of his big hits,”
said defensemen Dan
Pasquini. «

In Pitt’s ﬁrst game on
Saturday, University of
Maryland at Baltimore
County shocked the Panthers,
5-4.

“We’ve never lost to
them. We played lousy,” said
Nelf. A

In Pitt’s ﬁnal game, a
costly penalty resulted in three
Maryland goals and an 8-1
Pitt loss. In this game, a Pitt
player argued a call and was
given a four—minute unre-
leaseable penalty, a penalty
which rendered Pitt short-
handed for four minutes,
regardless of how many goals
were scored and what hap-
pened on the ﬁeld. The penal-
ty is comparable to a ﬁve-
minute major in hockey.

“The team was frustrated
with the oﬁciating, which
was honible,” said Neif. “I
don’t blame the player for get-
ting upset.”

Neither the team nor the
coach is discouraged with last
weekend’s performance
because this is the fall season.
It is a time to get younger
players experienced and to
bring consistency to the team

“The new players played
better than expected,” said
Pasquini. “We had 40 players
down there and the fresh legs
really helped our team.”

Coach Neff still doesn’t
know what to expect.

“Right now I’m trying to
ﬁnd out what kind of team
I’ve got,” Neﬂ’ said. “We did
not have all our best players
last weekend, so I know how
we can play better.”

(Editor’s Note: the following is the sec-

ing NHL season.)

Heading into late August, most
hockey critics ﬁgured on the NHL’s
Northeast Division being a wide open
race to the top.

Then Mario Lemieux decided to
play one more year.

Here is the predicted order of ﬁnish,
of which Somerset native Mike Kovak
has given his approval:

1. Pittsburgh Penguins (last season:
45-24-13, 1st)

Mario Lemieux is back and the
Penguins are primed for another run at
the Northeast title and the Stanley Cup.
A healthy Lemieux and a steady defense
may do the trick.

With Lemieux, Jaromir J agr, Ron
Francis, forward Petr Nedved, and
winger Tomas Sandstrom, Pittsburgh
clearly owns one of the most potent
offensive squads in the NHL. Surfacing
rumors in the last few weeks say for-
ward Bryan Smolinski may be dealt for
a defenseman.

If the Penguins have one weakness,
it’s the squad’s defensive corps. The
Penguins made a solid offseason move,
trading a disappointing Sergei Zubov to
Dallas for veteran point-man Kevin
Hatcher, Other than Hatcher, the Pens’

and enforcer Chris Tamer, who has yet
to report to training camp. The acquisi-
tion of a Scott Stevens or a Scott
Niedermayer would solidify
Pittsburgh’s blueline and ensure a shot
at the Stanley Cup.

2. Montreal Canadiens (40-32-10,
3rd)

_ For Head Coach Mario Tremblay,
the Montreal Canadiens’ rebuilding
process is further ahead of schedule than
most predicted.

Rookie sensation Saku Koivu
ripped 20 goals in his
first season as an
NHLer. Brian Savage
got off to an early
start and ﬁnished the
‘95-’96 campaign with 25 lamp-lighters.
Martin Rucinsky and Valeri Bure are
coming off career numbers last season.
Andrei Kovalenko, who came over in
the Patrick Roy trade, ﬁnished with 56
points. And let’s not forget about Pierre
Turgeon, Vincent Damphousse and
Mark Recchi, players of all-star caliber.

Although netrninder Jocelyn
Thibault is not Roy, he ﬁnished with
solid numbers at the‘ end of last season.
Thibault, 21, compiled a 2.67 goals-
against-average (2.86 overall) ‘and an
18-9-2 record in the second half of the
year.

NHL PREDICTIONS

Penguins can't fly but they'll still conquer the Northeast

The Hartford Whalers enter the
1996-97 campaign again as the most
enigmatic squad in the NHL. On paper,
this team looks like a lock for the play-
offs. Looks can be deceiving.

The Whalers field a , relatively
young group of men, including winger
Geoff Sanderson 2 (24), Andrei
Nikolishin (23), Andrew Cassels (27),
center Jeff O’Neill (20), and Brendan
Shanahan (27). Shanahan is demanding
to be traded, and if he is, they’ll receive
more than enough in return.

The Whaler defense seems steady as
well. Jason McBain, 22, and Marek
Malik, 21, provide
a solid base for the
future. The acquisi-
tion of journeyman
Jeff Brown should
help the Hartford blue line corps in addi-
tion to veteran Glen Wesley. If Adam
Burt remembers how to skate this sea-
son, the Whalers could turn some heads.
4. Boston Bruins (40-31-11, 2nd)

Even though they knew it was com-
ing, the city of Boston was dealt a diﬁi-
cult blow this summer when winger
Cam Neely, the heart and soul of the
Bruins, announced his retirement.

Fortunately for Boston, Neely only
dressed in eight of their last 41 games
during the ‘95-’96 campaign, allowing
them to adjust to life without him.
Unfortunately, 34-year-old Adam Oates
isn’t getting any younger. The

Beantown offense will rely heavily on
the services of center Jozef Stumpel and
forwards Ted Donato and Steve Heinze.
Defensively, Ray Bourque is enter-
ing his 18th season, and unlike Oates, is
as solid as ever. As long as the Bruins’
“Energizer Bunny” keeps going and
going, the Bruins will be in the running
for a playoff position.
5. Buffalo Sabres (33-42-7, 5th) ,
While Buffalo is wooing fans with
their “Field of Dreams” scheme —— new
colors, a new logo, and a state-of-the-art
arena — those of us watching from the

‘other side aren’t buying it. The Sabres

are still the same struggling team that
missed the playoffs one year ago. If I
were GM John Muckler, I would have
spent more time getting some experi-
enced scorers and less on the opening of
a new arena.

Instead, the Buffalo front office has
elected to start off a “new” era of hock-
ey with an aging superstar (Pat
LaFontaine) and a group of young guns.
Forwards Derek Plante and Jason Dawe
have steadily improved in their three
seasons with Buffalo. Additionally,
Matthew Barnaby and Rob Ray put up
bigger numbers — in the penalty cate-
gory.

Goalie Dominic Hasek should keep
Buffalo close in most games, but the
Sabres’ success will only go as far as

October is here and you know what that
means. It means it’s time for playoff base-
ball. This year’s playoff rnatchups appear to
be as intriguing and exciting as ever.

Baltimore vs. Cleveland

The Orioles are making their ﬁrst post-
season appearance since l983. They will be
facing a monstrous task trying to knock off
the defending American League champs.
However, with their lineup and pitching,
they are one of the few teams that can do it.

With stars like Brady Anderson,
Roberto Alomar, Cal Ripken, Eddie Murray,
Bobby Bonilla and the newly acquired Todd
Zeile, this team is a serious threat to win it
all. They are one of the few teams that can
match the Indians oﬁensively.

However, if you are an Orioles fan,
don’t expect them to seriously challenge the
Indians. Although Cleveland didn’t ﬁnish
with nearly as many wins as last year, this
team is primed once again to make a run at
the championship. The new-look Indians
still have their three key players: Albert
Belle, Jim Thome and Orel Hershiser. Belle
will be great in the clutch, Thorne will deliv-
er ﬂie big homers and Hershiser, as he
always does, will keep Cleveland in the
game and ﬁnd a way to win.

Cleveland: 3-1

the Mariners last postseason, will be

 
  

   
   

   

Baseball plaoffs iige and exci despi Pirate   asence

extremely hungry. The Yankees are the team
to go with in this series because they have
the better pitching and the better bullpen.
New York: 3-2, in ﬁve close games.

Los Angeles vs. Atlanta_ '

What all the preseason magazines were
predicting to be the National League
Championship Series is a ﬁrst—round 
The Dodgers did their usual September
choke, losing their ﬁnal three games to the

San Diego Padres to forfeit the division. If '

ﬂie Dodgers’ big three Mike Piazza, Eric
Karros and Raul Mondesi can get hot, then
they have a chance at upending the Braves.
If not, get out the broom?

Atlanta looked impressive as ever in the
regular season, led by Cy Young lock John
Smoltz and the rest of their superb pitching
staff. Let me give you an idea of how good
their staff is. When they acquired Denny
N eagle from the lame-duck Pirates, the
Braves knew that he wouldn’t even be in the
starting rotation when the postseason came
around. Neagle is an all—star pitcher, for cry-
ing out loud!

In a battle of pitching and low-scoring
games (The Braves are ﬁrst in ERA and the
Dodgers second) the Braves will emerge
victorious. '

Atlanta: 3-1.
St. Louis vs. San Diego —

The upstart Padres are making their ﬁrst
postseason appearance since 1984, when
they went to the World Series. They are led

by should-be MVP Ken Caminiti and the ’

incomparable Tony Gwynn. A veteran

   

pitching staff, led by Bob Tewksbuiy, will be
tough to beat.

Manager Tony LaRussa’s Cardinals are
in the playoffs for the ﬁrst time in seeming-

. ly eons. But we all know that the Cardinals

really suck They play in the worst division
in baseball (the NL Central) and ﬁnished
with a relatively unirnpressive 87-75 mark.
They have a few Sluggers in Ron Gant and
Gary Gaetti, but this team is too old. Dennis
Eckersely left his game in Oakland and the
team will sputter against the Padres. San
Diego: 3-1.

And now, on to the rest of my predic- -

tions for the rest of the playoffs.
Cleveland vs. New York

Cleveland and New York will match up
in a battle of titans for the ALCS. This series
will sway back and forth until the Yankees
ultimately '
prevail in
dramatic fashion in the seventh and deciding
game. .
New York: 4-3.
San Diego vs. Atlanta

The Padres and Braves matchup in the
NLCS will not be as entertaining. The
Braves will shut down the pesky Padres
with their phenomenal pitching staff.
Atlanta: 4-2. -
New York vs. Aﬂanta

And now, a World Series for the ages. .

Or so you think. The Aﬂanta Braves, led by
playoif MVP Chipper Jones, will bury the
legendary New York Yankees to become
back-to-back champions. Atlanta 4-1.

five for the first time this season with
his pleasantly surprising time of 28:14.

“That was as positive for us as Ed’s
performance,” Sobal said. “A lot of
guys have trouble adjusting to the
longer races in colleges, but I think he’s
adapting very well.” .

The women’s ﬁeld was stronger
than anticipated, with the University of
Michigan unexpectedly showing up
and winning the women’s race with 24
points. Pitt ﬁnished eighth of 12 teams
in the meet with 232 points.

“If everybody had run solid, not
spectacular, but solid, we would’ve
beaten Bradley and Ohio State and
been sixth instead of eighth,” said Pitt
Coach Dave Sobal.

Bradley ﬁnished sixth with 222
points, and Ohio State was seventh
with 227. '

“Stephanie Ellsworth did run a
good solid race,” Sobol said.‘ “Her
place didn’t reﬂect it, but to me, her
time showed marked improvement.”

Ellsworth finished 24th overall

- with a time of 19:28, three seconds

slower than last year on the -same
course, but this year’s course was in
much worse condition.

There was heavy rain the night
before the meet, which made the course
very muddy. It was so muddy that the
course was lengthened by 70 meters to
avoid one steep hill that was too dan-

gerous to’ run on.

Just how bad was the course? The
winner of the women’s race, Melissa
Mayers of Miami, ran the course in
18:20. Two weeks ago, on the regular
course, she ran it in 17:52. Despite the
conditions, no Pitt runners got hurt.

“You always worry" about people
falling or twisting an ankle or some-
thing in these conditions,” Sobal said.
“Fortunately, everyone came in
healthy.”

their youthful scorers take them.
6. Ottawa Senators (18-59-5, 6th)

Like the New York Islanders,
Ottawa continues to pile up on promis-
ing players and future prospects. While
this team may add a few more wins this
season, it won’t be enough to get them
out of the Northeast cellar.

1996 NHL Rookie of the Year
Daniel Alfredsson performed beyond all
expectations, leading the Senators in
goals (26) and assists (35). Alexei
Yashin, 23, should help this team get oif
to a better start than last year’s. Yashin,
who held out the beginning of last sea-
son, ﬁnished thesecond half with 15
goals and 36 points. Other than Yashin,
Alfredsson, and third-year forward
Radek Bonk, Ottawa doesn’t have
much more to offer for the upcoming
campaign.
