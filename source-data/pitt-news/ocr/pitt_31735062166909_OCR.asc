By the closest margin in the his-
tory of Student Government (SG)
elections, Ken Schueler, candidate
of the Positive Action Team, clinch-
ed the SG presidency over Indepen-
dent Armand Belly. Schueler garn-
ered 1,049 votes while Belly claimed 1,-
003. United Student Association Candi-
date George Dopenak received 432 votes.
Sc.hueler’s margin of 139 votes in the
School of Engineering offset Belly’s 84-
-vote margin in Liberal Arts and his
slnigihrt margin among the graduate stu-
dents. Frank Tutino, running mate of
Schueler and vice-president elect, is pres-
ident of the Engineering Student Cabi-
net, while none of the other candidates

for top SG pos.ts were engineers.

The presidentelect did not care to
comment on his victo-ry when the re-
sults were announced at 11 p.m. last
night. He said he would speak a week
from tonight at the iniiti-ation meeting
banquet, when he will formally assume

office.

The approximately 2,500 vote total

is the incumbent SG senator from the

Schueler was forced during the cam-
paign to face the question of the signi-
ﬁcance of SC, because his opponent Bel-

politics in SC by asserting that student
leaders with a “sense of values” could
do away with such things. He

Series on Dreams Continues

Miller Analyzes Dreams

by JOHN CAYWOOD

When is a lecture not like a
lecture? When Dr. Glenn Miller
lectured on dreams at the YM
and WHA Tuesday night he held
the audience's attention like few
lect-unres do.

Dr. Mililer, assistant professor
of clinical psychology at the
University, began with a very
brief review of his three previ.
ous lectures in the series. Then
he moved into the topic for the
evening: universal dream sym-
bols.

Rather than applying abso-
lutely -to everyone, Dr. Mililer ex-
plained, “universal” symbols
only generally apply to every-
one. And the work that Freud,
Jung, Fromm and Hall have
done seems to indicate that these
symbols are independent of cul-
tural factors. ‘

-Dr. Miller reported that these
men have investigated societies
completely isolated from other
civ

   
 
 

llizations for thousands of

seem to have similar associa-
tions for thinks like mountains
and circles. And investigators
have often found striking lin-
guistic slmlarities in the names

for these symbols.

voters indicated that they did
not have sufficient knowledge to
judge.

The question concerning the
Vietnam war brought forth the
smallest referendum voter re-
sponse (2,339 votes). Exactly
679 students voted to invade
North Vietnam, 602 persons ad-
vocated the present Vietnam po-
li-cy, 900 voters urged_the ces-
sation of bombing and immedi-
ate negotiations, and 158 per-
sons expressed their desire for
the unconditional withdrawal of
US troops.

The University controvery in-
volving secret research was also
subjected) to student opinion, re-
sulting in the highest referen-
dum vote tally.

on the dreamer, the report of
the dream, and the associations
the dreamer has with other
things and events. It is these as-
sociations that give individual-
ity to the interpretation of the
dream over and above the uni-
versal meaning it has.

Dr. Miller pointed out that an-
other important considenation is
the interpreter himself. Freud,
for example, tended to see near-
ly everything in a dream as ex-
pressive ‘of sexual urges. And
an uinskiilled interpreter may in-
sert into the interpretation of
someone else’s dream meanings
that the dream would have had
for himself.

Because darkness and the col-
or black or cultural symbols for
evil and ~ terror, the Negro
dreamer often sees himself as
a violent agressor in his dreams.
And because of these cultural
associations, said Dr. Miller,
“The white man sees the sym-
bol of the evil in himself when
he looks at a_Negro." This tends

  
 
     

  
     
  

Of the 2,491 students who re-
sponded to this question, 300 ad-
vocaited that no secret research
should be conducted, 1,516

thought that secret’ research A

should be allowed at the disg're-

tion of the Administration, 393 ,
‘believe that any secret research

should be allowed, and 282 put
down that they did not have
sufficient knowledge to judge.
The referendum question con-
cerning the University ‘ ROTC
sparked almost as -much re-

sponse as secret research. This .. .

question received a. total of 2,-
422 votes. Of the students vot-
ing, 182 advocated the abolish-

ment of the ROTC program, 494 

believed that RO'IlC should be
offered as an elective but mor-
ﬁcial credit or quality portraits
should be given, 1,686 voted that
the prognam should continue as
an elective, with credit given to-
ward graduation (present po-
licy), and 60 contended that
ROTC should be rnandaitory.

A ﬁnal referendum question

 

was on thecampus recruitment.

dilemma that resulted from the
nationwide campus demonstra-
tions protesting -the recruitment
of the Dow Chemical Co.

A total of 2,437 votes were
recorded regarding this issue. A
majority of students, 
in-g 2,160, maintained that any
company has the night to re-
cruit on campus. V

Of the remaining students vot-
ing on this issue, 119 believed
that certain companies should
not be allowed to recruiit and
158 voted that no companies
should be allowed to recruit on
campus and that students should
seek employment at an oﬂ’-cam-
pus location.

The University's School of

executive committee of the board

in December to change the of-
cia-l name to the School of Den-

Dr. Edward J. Forrest, dean
of the dental school, feels that
the new desi«gna.tion reﬂects
more accurately the broadening
scope of dentistry, and the ex-
panding prognams in lpatient

Peace Corps Workers Visit Monday

Five Peace Corps volun-
teers who have recently re-
turned from their posts
abroad will be on campus
Monday through Saturday,
Feb. 3 to speak to interest-
ed students.

They are Linda Gray Rosa-
lind Mavlloy, Mary T. Michlin,
Elizabeth Roberts, and Anne
Sherwood. These workers will
have a booth on the ground ﬂl00I‘
of the Cathedral.

The volunteers will adminis-
ter the Peace Corps language
placement test, now only la half
hour long, Tuesday through Fri-
day at noon, 2 and 4 p.m., and
Saturday at 11 a.‘m.—la«1l in 208

A film on the Peace Corps in
Nigeria, Give Me a Riddle, will
be shown Feb. 2 at 8 p.m. in 332
CL.

Currently 23 University stu-
dents are serving in the Peace
Corps, according to Dr. Walter
Ritenour, director of placement
and Peace Corps liason. In the
past, 70 University students
have served, making the Uni-
versity 85th of the top 200 col-
leges in the country in the con-
tribution of volunteers.

Linda M. Gray was assign-ed
to El Salvador where she work-
ed with a local group of citizens

    

 

in the capital city, San Salva-
dor. In the group were popular-
ly-elected residents of the area,
and their job was to improve
conditions in their neighborhood.
Through their efforts, a Boy
Scout and a G-irl Scout troop,
a credit and loan cooperative,
and a free night school were
created. Since this work occured
mostly on weekends and eve-
nings, Msi-ss Gray was able to-
teach English at the local sec-
ondary schools and at the Uni-
vernsity.

Mary T. Michlin served in the

Editorial: Reflections on a Campaign

 iisuuccessful in his bid for the Student Govern-

 ment (SG) Presidency, but the margin of victory was far from an over-

whelming mandate. One can dismiss the margin by sayingthat there
were three candidates in the race, making it exceedingly difficult for
any one person to be a “majority” President. However, the fact that
a majority of those who voted did not vote for our new President
should be weighed carefully by Schueler. V

In the past, the slogan “to the winners belong the spoils” has
reigned supreme, much to the misfortune of SG. Schueler vowed dur-
ing this campaign that if he were elected, he would not be bound by
any previous commitments of political alliances. We urge him to trans-
late his words into reality by extending an invitation to serve SG to
those students who have indicated a real desire to make a construc-
tive contribution. Party labels are out of date as of today. Let us
now look at those individuals who have expressed a willingness to
renew SG and give them a chance to have that opportunity to prove
themselves. »

Another factor to consider about this past campaign is the size-
able vote attracted by Armand Belly", who ran on a platform to abolish
SG. Belly was not alone in his criticism of the current structure of

SG, although he was the only one who advocated total abolition. All

candidates agreed that the status quo was not good_enough, while dif-
fering on solutions. But the fact that all expressed dissatisfaction is
a definite mandate for a re-evaluation of the structure of SG. SG
came too close to being abolished for anyone to accept it in its current

form. The questionniiinow is, what is of strength-
ening this organization?

Perhaps still another contention about the results of this past
election is that students were not really protesting the existence of
SG———this was merely a means of reflecting alienation. By fighting for
the abolition of c-SG, were not students exercising a rare opportunity
to register a protest against everything they’re dissatisfied with in
this University? It almost seemed as if those protesting were uncon-
cerned about the specific cause——they were far more anxious to take
a strike at the system in general. We cannot really condone this, for
we firmly believe that those students who come out of the woodwork
two weeks each year to ‘work for a particular candidate should utilize
their energies in the numerous opportunities available on this campus.
Political campaigns are exciting, but they are only a dramatic high-
light; the real work is done by those who contribute in organizations
throughout the year, not just during January.

And so we congratulate Ken Schueler on his victory and urge
him to give those students who do care a chance to contribute toward
strengthening a system. And to those “alienated” students who worked
toward the cause to abolish SG—we can only say, SG is but one of the
more than 130 organizations on campus. Why not use your energies
toward strengthening any one of them? If constructive efforts fail,
then you have a legitimate protest. Otherwise, it somehow always

seems like sour grapes.

 

Death By Campaign

The Great God Apathy

Pittsburgh, Jan. 30, 1968. THE LAST
DESK was removed from the Cathedral
of Learning today, and as the doors were
locked forever on the University of Pitts-
burgh’s skyscraper classroom, ghostly
echoes of the cry, “Bring back John Rus-

* kay” were heard ringing through the dark,

empty halls.

Not much publicity has been spread
about Pitt’s untimely death of two weeks
ago. Perhaps all those involved wish to
keep the mess as quiet as possible, and
with good reason. But the funeral is over
now, and the students have all crept away
to the comforting shadows of their respec-
tive. homes. The facts can now be told
about that sorrowful moan that rose at
precisely 7 p.m. on the 24th from from

v the Oakland campus, and about the subse-
quent death of “a large, urban university.”

January 24th was election day for exec-
utive and legislative offices of the Univers-
ity’s Student Government. Campaigns for
these offices had been launched on Mon-
day the 15th, and during ‘the following
nine days, subtle i:ndications of Pitt’s mor-

' tality became apparent but were ignored

until death struck in the early evening of
the 24th. Here are the details of that cri-
tical period: ‘

Two new campus political parties arose
and presented executive candidates, sena-
torial slates and platforms. The platforms

iv of the parties consisted of the same dish-

water that has been offered by past parties
seeking Student Government control. The
customary cries for improvement of Home-
coming, parking facilities, even education
and the Student Government itself rang

C with the same sincerity of countless previ-

ous campaigns. Of course everyone ex-
pounded upon good old “Student Apathy.”
A few new placebos were added. This

J year someone said something about class-

room doors, and everyone proposed a bil-

' lion new committees. But the 1968 cam-

paign was no different from any other as
it blurted hopeless promises to get Stu-
dent Government doing what it should

a » have been doing for years.

The individuals involved did present a
new wrinkle to the whole thing, and it is
here that the ultimate cause- of death may
lum One party. Datriotically entitled

eotyped records qualifying them for of-
fice: member of this, chairman of that.
But neither was considered to be -much of
a leader. They were quiet and convention-
al, and the dynamism of both together was
equal to that of a candidate for head cus-
todian of the Cathedral basement.

The second party was formed atthe.-A

last minute by a select number of the
powers-that-were who apparently thought
as little of the aforementioned candidates
as everyone else did. Their alternative for
president arose in the form of a starry-
eyed fraternity boy. This bright, young,
philosophy major was as shocked at his
sudden candidacy as was everyone else this

‘ side of J ohnstown.

But to counteract the true innocence of
their presidential hopeful, the party pull-
ed a real sharp maneuver and tapped a
nice, harmless, incumbent senator from
the Engineering School to run for vice-
president.

This second slate of candidates was no
more stimulating than the first. The elders
spoon-fed a platform to their charges— -as
if the youngsters had to learn anything
new.

Suddenly a third candidate roared io
like a kamikaze pilot. Disgusted with Stu-
dent Government, the party candidates
and everything else, he offered a platform
of destruction. He sought his election in
order to abolish his office and dissolve
Student Government.

This late candidate called the others,
“Mediocre!”

They‘ replied, “We may be mediocre,
but we’re sincere.”

And thus the campaign went. The inde-
pendent called everyone incompetent and
useless. The party men forgot their age-
old platforms and ‘spent all their time and
energy reacting to the anarchist.

At two minutes to seven, a small be-
specled freshman was seen wandering into
the Student Union. He froze at the sight

his glasses and took a second look, then
scurried away into the night.

The rest is sad history; the entire cam-
pus was deserted within 24 hours. Not
much is known about the fates of faculty
and administration members. The last
words to be heard from anyone were spok-
en by a minor administrator as he drove

Sure you‘ve used NoDoz to help you
stay awake the night before an exam.

But have you ever thought of taking
NoDoz to make yourself a little sharper
during the exam itself?

Well, maybe you should.

Let's say you‘re one of those guys
who doesn‘t have to cram like mad the
night before. (Even so, you‘re probably
not getting your usual amount of sleep.)

And let‘s say the morning of the big
exam, you find yourself heading for
class, kind of drowsy and unwound
and wondering if The Great Brain has
deserted you in the night.

What do you do? _

You panic, that's what you do.

Or, if you happened to read this ad,
you walk coolly over to the water cooler
and wash down a couple of NoDoz, the

Exam Pill. And before long you‘re feel-
ing more alert and with it again.

You see, NoDoz helps bring you up
to your usual level of alertness, so you
don‘t just sit there in a fog; it's got what
it takes to help restore your perception,
your recall, and even your ability to
solve problems.

In fact, NoDoz contains the strongest
stimulant for your mind that you can
take without a prescription. Yet it‘s not
habit forming.

Okay, but what about the guy who

Nope.

Last year, Baldwin-Wallace
ﬁnished fourth in the NAIA
tourney, losingrto eventual cham-
pion Winston-Salem (and Earl
“The Pearfl” Monroe) in the
«semi-ﬁnals.

But, says coach Bob Timmons,

Gymnasts Hope To End
Six Game Losing Streak
Here Against Kent State

Coach Neiger hasn’t been
overjoyed the last seven
weeks. Saturday the gym-

S , nastics team will try to snap a

six game losing streak at Kent
State’-s~ expense, starting at 2
pm.

“I am going to try for a win
in this one,” said Neiger. “I plan

- to work th-ree varsity men in

each event and I will use my

, freshmen more sparingly than I

did against Springﬁeld and Navy.
We gave Kent a .good battle last
year.” Last year, the gymnasts
‘lost --to Kent State by three
points.

Kent, coached by Rudy Brech-
ma, has a ﬁne all-around -man
in -Brian Gallagher. Gallagher

in the ﬂoor exerci-se, the long-

, horse,‘ and the «parallel bars.

Paul Na-ukasm is a solid back-
up man for G-afllagher on the
ﬂoor exercise, still rings, and
parallel bars. He can score 8.75
on ‘those events. He is also a
potential 9.0 performer on the

A 1 .-horizontal bar and a 9.5 per-

7 - former on the longhorse.

In last year's -meet, Na-ukam
edged Dave Shidemantle in vault-
ing, 9.40-9.35. .

“Kent State may be tough, but
‘if Shideman-t-le and Tom Fisher
get back into form I think we

'1 can give them a good battle,”

Neiger said.

year, the gymnasts had an iden-
tical record, 1-6, and were head-
ed for the worst marks in school
history, ﬁnishing at 2-9.

But last season, Shidemantle
could only compete after he re-
covered from a fractured foot.
Though he still managed to
place sixth on the longhorse in
the EIGL, his season’:s perform-
ance was hampered extremely.

This year Neiger, who began

ty athletes, has not had an in-

haven’t been the same without
him.”

Sitill, Timmons isn’t taking
Baldwin-Wallace lightly. “We've
been shooting ba-d and playing
bad,” he said, “and we can't
take anyone lightly.”

One of the reasons for the
Panther troubles, 'I‘i»mm~on.s ex-
plained, has been the fact that
“we’re getting killed off the
boards.” To try and add some
height against a team whose
front line averages 6"6”, he an-
nounced that Charlie Hunt will
start at center.

Ken Bollens will start at one
forward, with either Mike Patch-
er or Rob . McFarland at the

other. Patcher is the leading
scorer, but Timmons credited
McFarland with being the team's
best ballplayer lately. Bollens
has been weakened by the ﬂu
but according to Timmons “he
has his strength back now and
should start scoring more.”

Timmons al-so announced that
Pete Smith will open with Tony
DeLisio at guard. “We need Pete
to move our ball club,” he ex-
plained. “Bob Petrini can shoot,
but he's always looking for the
shot instead of «setting up the
offense. He has to learn to move
the team better.”

Wave is averaging 92 points a
game and hits about 48 per cent
from the ﬁeld, but their oppon-
ent-s are connecting on 52 per
cent o-f their shots. That's iden-
tical to what Panther opponenuts
are averaging.

The Panther strategy will
probably be to slow the game
down and work for the good
shot. When the cagers did -that
against Miami, another run and
shoot team, they stayed in the
game according to Timmons.
When they let Miami run, “they
got away from us. We can't play
that type of game,” he explain-
ed.

Matmen Topple Cornell, 22 -12

by ROY JACOBS
Maybe the wrestling fans at yesterday’s
meet with Cornelll were biting their nails
as to the outcome, but coach Dave Adams wasn’t
worrying about his team at all. Terry Hoover
pinned heavyweight Brian Whitaker of the Big
-Red to clinch the varsity wrestlers’ home open-
er, 22-12.
Before the heavyweight bout, Adams, his
squad, and approximately 300 fans watched Cor-
nell close in on the varsity lead, winn.ing the 167,

in ‘, 177, and 191 pound matches. Had Hoover been

pinned in his match, the meet would have ended
“in a tie, 17-17.
Still, Adams was unphased by Cornell’-s rally.
“I though we had it-after Rhone (152) Won,"
said Adams afterwards. “That was the big one.

 And, of course, the fall at the beginning. I knew
“ we would win the last match.”

'1‘.he fall at the beginning was contributed by

 sphomore Bruce Unan-gst, who went from a Navy
- ride to a double arm bar tor the pinning com-

bination wit.h just 1:20 remaining in his bout.
Yet, Unangst was a doubtful starter as late as

 yesterday morning.

.‘‘It all mattered how he felt beforehand,” ex-

; pzlained Adams. “He only had two nights of prac-
" ‘t-ice since coming back.” Unangst had been suf-

[fering from a knee injury.
*“ 2 6 hi“  match, thou

ured that his team stacked‘ up 5-5 in the individ-
ual match-ups with Cornell, with several ques-
tion marks. Rhone was one question mark who
came through.

“Jim wrestled a good match at Navy last

-- wee ,” offered Adams, “but that was at‘ 167. We

really need him at 52. I’m sure he proved to him
self today that he could wrestle there and make
weight without giving anything away t-o- his op-
ponent.”

Rhone defeated sophomore Dave Oullert, 7-6,
despite giving away four points in the ﬁnal per-
iod. Oulleat was highly touted before the meet,
but Rhone came extremely close to p-inning him
in the second period, following a taked-own. He
was awarded a predicament (two points) when
most everybody thought he should have gotten
three points for a pear fall.

Overall, Adams was happy with everyone,
including the fans. Sophomore Paul Allen wrest-
led Cornell's top man Dick Minekime to a stand-
still for two periods, and Larry Cuba came up
with ‘a big win at 145.

“VVe beat them on their feet,” analyzed
Adams. “hast week we worked hard on take-
downs and conditioning. We were deﬁnitely more
aggressive. '

“We all wrestled well,” he continued. “This
has to be our best match. The difference was,
 kids rea-llyv wianted this one.” Saturday, the

   
 

for he has yet to recover from
an illness that hospitalized him
during the past week. Carl
Wooten, who pulled a muscle
against Kent, will not be ready
on Saturday either. Wooten’s re-
placement on the mile relay
team, which also includes Roger
Holly, Carlos Reisen, and Jack
Neyer, is not yet known.

Pau»l Zink, sophomore miler,
who ﬁnnished behind Kent's
Olympic hopeful, Sam Bair, in
the ﬁrst meet, summed u.p the
outlook for Saturday. “I was
nervous in the ﬁrst meet, and
tightened up a little. I should
be relaxed on Saturday.”

Penn State and Delaware won't
bring nationally known‘ stars as
Kent did last week, but the two
team's ovenalll strength should
be as good. The teams make up
in depth what they lack in in-
dividual stars.

Although the tracksters will
offer less depth, they will offer
some experienced entries. Greg
Ellis, who has been hard at work
in practice all week ironing out
ﬂaws in his sho-t put form, will
attempt to repeat his first place
ﬁnish in the shot.

John Gurson, who set the var-
sity broad jump mark 1-ast week,
will be joined by Tom Christie
and Bob McElh~eny in that event.

Christie held the broad julmp
recordbeﬁore Gurson’s leap Sat-
urday. He also combines with
Dave Brinn and Reisen to give
the team its strongest entry in

one event, the 60 yard high hur- '

dles. =

“Christie couldn't get his steps
down against Kent, and fouled
on every jump,” said coach Jim
Banner. “Bu-t he ha-s been work-
ing on them and should be ready
Saturday.

The frosh, who have been
breaking records as if they were
the tape at the ﬁnish line, will
face the toughest opponent of
the year. With victories over the
Plebes of Navy and Kent’s frosh,
the young runners will be look-
ing for win number three.

Both the varsity and frosh
teams were pleased with the
home track advantage they will
have, and if last week's crowd is

Swimmers Travel to New
Natatorium at Penn State

“If they are going to take
one the rest of this season,
they had better take this
one," said coach Bill Grant em-
phatically referring to his swim-
ming team's chances against
Penn State Saturday afternoon.

third straigh.t week on the road
in search of their second victory
of the season. The team's record
now stands at 1-4.

Penn State is ﬁelding their
ﬁrst swimming team in 17 years.
Everything is brand new for the
State swimmers. Besides the
team, they compete in a $1,800,-
000 three pool Natatorium un-
der the guidance of new head
coach Lou MacNeil.

“but unless we have a complete
mental let-down, the boys should
take it.” Grant based a great
deal of his pre-meet optimism
on this season's times in which
the swimmers show a decisive
edge.

Penn State's team is mostly
composed of sophomores and
juniors. According to Barry Si-

ager, all the Lions are perﬁorm-
ing without scholarships. But
