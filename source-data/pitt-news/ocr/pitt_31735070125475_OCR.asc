consider offering  
same-sex benefits

DAVE HARTMAN

News Editor

Pitt announced yesterday that it would form a committee to
study the feasibility of extending health beneﬁts to the same-sex
partners of University employees.

The decision comes after more than ﬁve years of litigation

between Pitt and the American Civil Liberties Union, which repre- »

sents seven current and former employees to whom ﬂue University
has refused to extend same-sex partner health beneﬁts.
The class action suit, which has been temporarily suspended as
a result of Pitt’s decision to form ﬂie committee, seeks damages on
behalf of gay and lesbian Pitt employees. But according to the
ACLU, the lawsuit’s higher purpose is to foster policy change. - ’
Vic Walczak, director of the Pittsburgh chapter of the ACLU,

said the committee’s formation was a step in the right direction

“We’re pleased that they’ve agreed to even consider it,” he said.

' Walczak cited numerous other colleges and universities '—
including Carnegie Mellon University, which extended the beneﬁts
in May 2000 4 as evidence that providing same-sex beneﬁts is both

feasible and increasingly common.

Student Government Board President Jeff Alex and the
eight members of the 2002 board were elected on April 11. But
because of complications surrounding an oversight in SGB’s
constitution, the date on which they will actually take office
remains undetermined. ' ‘

Alex said his board is ready to begin mobilizing on the
goals it formulated for the upcoming school year, including
arranging effectivetransportation to the new football stadium
and working to improve retention rates at Pitt.

But according to the constitution, President Mike

Unangst’s 2001 board is officially in office until the beginning

0 of January.

The confusion emanates from changes made to the election
cycle when a student referendum passed Proposition A on Oct.
18. The approval of Proposition A mandated that SGB elections
would be switched from November to April.

At a meeting two days before the referendum, board mem-
bers established that if the proposition passed, the 2001 board

Boulevard traffic restricted until December

. DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

More than 42,000 cars travel on -the Boulevard
of the Allies between Downtown and Oakland every
day. But between now and December, many of those

cars will be detoured to allow for reconstruction of
the major artery. L 1 v . .

At 9 a.m. yesterday, workers closed the east-
bound lanes and limited westbound trafﬁc on the
Boulevard to only one lane. The restrictions will
remain in place until Dec. 21, the tentative comple-
tion date forthe project. . ' ' - 1 ’ '

The repairs, which include replacing the right
outbound lane and reinforcing the slope near
Duquesne University, are part of a preparatory pro-
ject designed to ease the trafﬁc problems that will be
associated with the closing and rehabilitation of the
Fort Pitt Tunnels,
scheduled for 2002
and 2003.

T h e
Pennsylvania
Department of
Transportation
awarded Mascaro
Construction the
$10.8 million con-
tract for , the
upgrades. After the
outbound lane is
replaced, the rocky
slopes reinforced

     

and a fence added to protect motorists from falling
rock, the road will be repaved in the spring of 2002.

According to Chuck Baca, a construction coor-
dinator for the project, most traffic will be diverted
to Route 376. Though unable to provide preliminary

' indications of the project’s effect on traffic between

Downtown and Oakland, Baca said the first few
days of the detour would likely prove the most difﬁ-
cult. .
“The first day or two are going to be the worst,
until people get acclimated to the changes,” Baca
said. “Hopefully, people will ﬁnd an alternate route
 a few days.” ' s

The seven-month detour is also affecting
numerous Port Authority Transit bus routes, includ-
ing the 67A, 77U and the Airport Flyer.

PennDOT has a hotline to assist motorists with
the trafﬁc pattern‘ changes. Call the hotline at 269-
6111 weekdays between 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.

Pitt community turns
out for golf benefit

ERIK MEUSER

Staff Writer

Yesterday may not have been the
best day for golf, but the rain that fell for a
good part of the morning and again in the
evening did not dampen anyone’s spirits at
the sixth armual Kevin Cecil Golf Outing.

The event, held this year at
Southpointe Country Club in Washington
County, beneﬁts former Pitt engineering
student Kevin Cecil, who was the victim
of a drive-by shooting seven years ago.
The shooting left Cecil, a ﬁrst-year engi-
neering student at the time, permanently
paralyzed from the neck down.

The outing
was organized and
sponsored by Chris
Monti, owner of the
Touch of Gold
Jewelry Store in
Oakland and friend
of the Cecil family,
the Oakland Rotary
and other Oakland
rn e r c h a n t s .
According to Monti,
the event has raised
more than $100,000
over the last ﬁve
years and is expect-
ed to surpass the
$120,000 mark after
this year.

“The first
year we had about
100 people take part
and it has been a
snowball effect
every year since,”
Monti said. before
the noon tee off.

  
   

people registered to take part in this year’s
event.

In the past, the money raised from
the outing was used to help pay for the
costs of Cecil’s medical bills. Beginning
last year, however, the Cecil family decid-
ed to give 25 percent of the proceeds to a
scholarship ﬁmd for Pitt engineering stu-
dents. A

According to Monti, last year the
ftmd awarded ﬁve $1,000 scholarships.

As the noon tee time arrived and
the rain slowed to an occasional drop,

Plexiglas windshield of his golf cart and

prepared his gear for a day on the course.
“I got involved for two reasons,”

iMcMannus said. “First, because of a

strong suggestion by Chris [Monti] and
second, after meeting Kevin and his fami-
ly.”

Kevin’s father, Carl Cecil, a tall
man with a sense of humor to match,
slowed his golf cart to a stop at the 10th tee
to allow the group to followhim to tee off.

“We started the scholarship last
year because of the way Pitt has been with
the accident,” he said as he puffed on his
cigar and moved toward his llth-tee start-
ing point. .

Carl Cecil was grouped with
Mike Takos, owner of Kinko’s on Forbes

Avenue, Andy Hardie, part owner of Dave
and Andy’s on Atwood Street, John
Tamiggi, a friend of Monti, and Joe

Risacher a Pitt alumni who now works as '

a head hunter and lives in the North Hills.
The group’s attitude toward each summed
up the attitude of all of the golfers for the
day.

When asked who was going to
win‘ the long drive contest, Carl Cecil
responded with, “Mike’s-pretty good when
he’s loose,” as Risacher let out an “ouch”
during a practice swing.

‘”Ihere’s his ouch for the day,”
Carl Cecil quickly responded.

As the ﬁrst hour of the outing
came and went, the club house, much like
the rain clouds, slowly cleared out so
many of the business owners and friends
of the Cecil family took time out of their
schedules to enjoy a day of golf for a good
cause. i

Throughout the suit’s six-year history
Pitt has repeatedly declined to extend bene-
ﬁts based on the costs andlegal complica-
tions it claims would result from such a deci-
sion. In 1999, Pitt asserted that otTering,ben-
eﬁts would cost the University more than
$300,000. I According to the ACLU, Pitt
recently assessed the costs" associated wiﬂr
granting beneﬁts at $50,000, but the ACLU
maintains that ﬁgure is closer to $25,000.

Pitt has also cited the possibility of los-
ingfunding from state legislators who could
jeopardize the state-related school’s funding
if it extended beneﬁts.

In 1999, the state passed legislation that
exempted state and state-related universities
from adhering to local ordinances regarding
the extension of beneﬁts. The legislation
boosted Pitt’s position against the ACLU
because it prevented the city’s ordinance on
same-sex beneﬁts from applying to Pitt.

According to the ACLU, the. legislation
was “aimed at derailing the ACLU lawsuit.”
And according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazettc, the legislation may have been
prompted by at leasthone high-ranking Pitt
ofﬁcial.

According to the Post-Gazette,
Executive Vice Chancellor Jerome Cochran
received a faxed copy of the proposed legis-
lation on Nov. 5, 1999. The fax was from an
unknown source in Harrisburg, Pa, but it
prompted the ACLU to contend that the

. . , , , .

University “conspired with the Pennsylvania
legislature to violate plaintiffs’ constitutional
rights by passing the statute to deny lesbians
and gay men equal protection of the law.”
The ACLU  that Pitt’s refusal
to extend beneﬁts is partly fueled by some
members of the Board of Trustees that have

,‘ ‘expressed hostility toward lesbians and gay

men as well as concem that the provision of
samc—sex domestic partner beneﬁts would
harm University fund-raising efforts.”

In a 1999 sworn deposition, trustee J.

Wray Connolly said he would have a prob- ‘

lem with gays being employed as child care
workers. Former Pitt trustee James Plaherty,
who left the board in 1995, has also been
accused of having an anti-homosexual atti-
tude.

0 According to a University press release,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg will appoint
the committee that will assess the feasibility
of offering beneﬁts. That committee will be
made up of faculty, administrators, staff, stu-
dents, alumni and trustees. V

Pitt said the investigation will provide A

“a full and impartial exploration of the ram-
iﬁcations and implications of the policy
options available tothe University.”

The University also praised those
involved with the lawsuit, saying that the
moratorium on the lawsuit establishes a cli-
mate that “permits the University an appro-

priate examination of the issues involv ” -

Pitt spokesman Ken Service declined to
comment further on the University’s deci-
sion to form the committee. “

would hold ofﬁcefrom January 2001 to
April 2001. Elections would then be held
in April, with the new board taking ofﬁce
in May. .

According to Alex,
Constitutional Review Committee
changed the bylaws of the constitution to
reﬂect the changes in terms of ofﬁce after

FROM PAGE 1

Proposition A passed. But it neglected to

amend the constitution itself.
Consequently, the constitution now
reads that the board will take ofﬁce on the
first day of the winter term: Jan. 7, 2002.
Alex regards the oversight as an error
that should not prevent his board from
progressing.
‘ “I’m up here every day, trying to get
work done and get my board ready,” he

said, speakingbehind a desk already cov- q

ered with stacks of papers, letters and
memos. 1

Jay Dworin, a member of Unangst’s ‘

2001 board, agreed that the January date
was a technical oversight.

“I don’t think anyone [of the 2001
board] cares to be in ofﬁce,” he com-

mented.

Yet an air of confusion and contro-

' nversy continues» to pervade the issue of

the transition of power.

According to Dworin, the constitu-
tional oversight was called to the 2001
board’s attention approximately two
weeks before the close of the school year.

Dworin said that Unangst informed the -,
’ board that he would consult with a parlia-

mentarian and that the board would con-
tinue to meet after the school year ended
to wrap up business and decide what to
do about the constitutional error.’

‘Unangst could not be reached for
comment..

On May 1, shortly before he left for
a summer internship in New York City,
Unangst sent a three-page letter to mem-
bers of his board and‘ the April electees.
In the letter, Unangst reviewed the situa-
tion and concluded that the will of the
students, as reﬂected by the referendum,
was that the new board would begin
working in May. A _

Unangst asked the .2001 board to
“work toward a" complete and highly
effective transition that will begin imme-

A diately.” He also stated his intention to

administer the presidential oath to Alex
that same day and wrote that Alexcould
swear in the members of his board at his
convenience.

Four days later, the 2001 board con-

vened. Board members Kya O’Quinn

. and Joel Thurston were absent, but the

present members discussed and subse-
quently passed Resolution 006 with a 5-1
vote.

' Drafted by Thurston and e-mailed to.

the board, the resolution declared that
Unangst overstepped the bounds of his
authority on May 1 when he swore Alex
into office and single-handedly dictated
that the transition of power should take
place immediately. '

the '

“We therefore resolve that all actions
taken and directives issued by President
Unangst concerning the inauguration and
term of ofﬁce of the 2002 Student
Government Board are hereby rescinded
and rendered null and void,” the resolu-

tion read.
Resolution 006 concluded that '

SGB’s Judicial Committee would deter-
mine when the 2002 board would take
omce, but that the date of the transition
was “not to be earlier than the completion

of the 2001 Student Government Board’s

unfinished business.”

V The 2001 board’s unsettled affairs
include the approval of a $23,000 budget
for the Asian Student Association and
ensuring a student referendum in the fall

. on a recent proposal for a new constitu-

tlOI'l.

‘Dworin alleged that Unangst led the "

2001 board to believe that because of the
constitutional glitch, it would have ample
time after the spring semester to tackle
these issues. When Unangst proceeded to
write the letter armouncing his plans to
swear in Alex, Dworin said he and others
were angered. ‘

“Our board was substantially differ-
ent than any board in history,” he said.
“We had a majority of people of color,
and we took stances and waged cam-
paigns to ﬁght for equal access to educa-
tion.” — S

Dworin said that SGB adviser Joyce
Giangarlo, Unangst and Alex engineered
the shift of power because of differences
in ideology and perspective.

Giangarlo said that the notion of the
2001 board beginning its term this spring
reﬂected “every board’s intent.”

“That’s what the students were told

they were going to do,” she said. “I don’t
know how it could be any clearer.”

Alex said that though Unangst’s let-
ter “was labeled as shady because it was
last minute,” it was his assumption that
Unangst “was acting in the interest of the
students who voted in the referendum.”

As the Judicial Committee does not

normally convene over the summer, the

date on which Alex’s board will ofﬁcial-
ly take power remains undecided. In the
meantime, student government remains
in a state of ﬂux and compromise, with
the 2001 board working to ﬁnish its
remaining issues and the 2002 board
gearing up for its term.

“As far as students go, we will still
be working, regardless of whether the old
board wants to stick around and continue
to work on their unﬁnished business,”
Alex said.

Developments promising in

same-sex controversy

The University administration is
ﬁnally coming to its senses about the
same-sex beneﬁts issue.

For the last ﬁve years, Pitt has
been entangled in litigation over grant-
ing -beneﬁts to same-sex partners of

» faculty and staff. At times, the battle

over this has resulted in hunger strikes,
protests and nasty verbal exchanges.

But it appears a resolution is
imminent. The University will form a
committee to study the issue, and in
exchange, the plaintiffs will suspend
their lawsuit pending the committee’s
decision.

This committeeis a step in the
right direction, but only if the
University is doing this in good faith
and not simply as a stall tactic.

It is also a good public relations
move on the part of the adrninistra-
tion; Pitt has come under ﬁre in recent
years because of homophobic remarks
from trustees such as J. Wray

Connolly.
When the committee presents its
report to Chancellor Mark

Nordenberg in six months, the report
should contain the right conclusion ——
that Pitt will grant same-sex beneﬁts.
It makes no sense for Pitt to con-
tinue ﬁghting this issue so ferociously;
the University has most likely spent a
much larger amount on lawyers’ fees
than it would on beneﬁts. What if
these employees were heterosexual

and married? What if homosexual
marriage was legal in Pennsylvania?

The University would then pay bene-

ﬁts to these same people.

Sarne—sex beneﬁts are easy to
implement. The University could
establish speciﬁc criteria for who
should receive these beneﬁts and easi-
ly prevent abuse of this system.

Although no Pennsylvania state
universities currently grant same-sex
beneﬁts, many private universities and
corporations do. A city of Pittsburgh
ordinance has required certain
employers within the city limits to do
so since 1990, and although there is a
question whether Pitt, as a state-relat-
ed university, must obey that ordi-
nance, it nonetheless shows a long-
established trend.

By granting same-sex beneﬁts,
Pitt can be a trend-setter among
Pennsylvania state universities. Pitt
could have a new competitive edge in
attracting quality faculty, something
thatthe administration is striving to
achieve.

The controversy over whether Pitt '

should grant same-sex beneﬁts has
been blown out of proportion by the
University. Sarne-sex beneﬁts would
constitute a rniniscule part of the
University's armual $1 billion budget.
Finally the administration is will-

Good riddance to the Beehive

‘Four years ago my parents visited me at
school. When they saw the Beehive, I looked
at them and could see how they suddenly did-

n’t want me to go to school here.

Sure 'it’s narrow-minded, but considering

how disgusting that place looked, I don’t
blame them. And every visitor I brought to Pitt _

would look at it in the sarneway. This was not
just because the place looked weird, but

‘because of the punks, hippies, art freaks and

assorted social outcasts that were always
hanging out there.

I’m sure I’ve just pissed off all of the
artsy, dyed hair, studded-leather-jacket read-
ers. Well, boo hoo — get a haircut.

I’ve never liked that place.
Back in the day it was not just a
bar, but also a movie theater —
what a combination.

Since it was such a strange
hang out, what type of movies do
you think they played? Lots of indie ﬂicks
about gay cowboys who like to get high and
eat yogurt "

Oh sure, they would ‘play some main-
stream ﬂicks if they were edgy enough. I went
to see “The Matrix” there at least three times.
But beyond that I hated to go there because of
the aforementioned artsy, dyed hair, studded-
leather-j acket freaks. '

To be perfectly honest, I am an English
writing major. Thus I have classes with lots of
artsy, dyed hair freaks. I know that the term
freaks doesn’t bother them, since that’s what
tl1ey’re going for most of the time.

Anyway, ' most of these people in my
classes are harmless and pretty nice. In_ fact, I
even like talking to a few. But, and this is
where we come to the problem, that type of
attitude and dress is acceptable only in col-
lege. ‘ — .

The reason I don’t have a problem with
these people in my classes is because they are
the college demographic. If you want to dress
weird, talk weird and act weird then this is the
time to do it. I

If you want to pierce every part of your

LEE

face, this isthe time in your life to do so. But‘

STEIN

Siixivi‘ \VRl’l‘l-ZR

 

if people are still acting like that after, say, age
28, it’s a problem. _
It’s a problem because they are an eye-

I sore. They make Oakland look all the more

disgusting, and it already has enough going
for it in that area. It’s a problem because they
don’t go away, but stay there day in and day
out.

They also attract a bad element. Because
these artsy, dyed-hair freaks consider them-
selves social outcasts they attract other social
outcasts. That’s why burns seem to love hang-

ing out around that area. That’s why skin- '

heads, for whatever reason, would be seen in
that place at night. That’s why Lord Viper
. Scorpion and his Minions of Evil
would hold their Magic: The
Gathering and Dungeons and
Dragons after-hours parties there".
To sum it all up look at the.
cover of last‘week’s Pitt News.
See that guy? He’s 30 and look at him. Do you
think he contributes to society in a meaningful
way? Do you think he does anything?

Of course, he would probably say he
does. He would tell you that he’s an artist, a
writer or a musician. He would tell you that
stepping on a ketchup packet on the sidewalk

is art. He would tell you lots of weird stuff like
that. And, unless you’re one of the aforemen- :

tioned dyed hair, studded-leatl1er-jacketwear-

ing freaks, you would look at him, roll your

eyes and laugh behind his back.
So, I don’t hate these people. I just. don’t
like them that much. I’m sure they feel the

same way about me. But now the problem is ' ’

solved. They have nowhere to hang out
around here except on certain nights at Club
Laga. So tothem I bid adieu. I hope they go
ﬁnd another weird little hangout that’s far
away from" me.

And wherever that is, I hope they’re
happy and that they stay there. .

. In the northeast corner of Alaska lies
one 7 of North America’s great natural
treasures, the Arctic. National Wildlife
Refuge. Its 19 million acres comprise one
of the last places on earth where an intact
expanse of arctic and subarctic lands
remain protected.

Nearly 95 percent of RA1\,1IN

Alaska’s North Slope is
already available to the oil
industry for exploration or

Refuge, is permanently protected.

The 1.5 million-acre coastal plain
area is considered to be the biological
heart of the Arctic Refuge. This area,
where the oil industry wants to drill, is
the center of the refuge’s wildlife activity
and its most productive area. It is most
probable that oil development would not
be concentrated in a small area, but
would spread over a large region con-
nected by roads, pipelines, power plants,
processing plants, airports, gravel mines,
power lines and other infrastructure.

There is indisputable proof that, no
matter how well done it is and how small
the area it covers, oil drilling has signiﬁ-
cant, lasting impacts on the environment;
it would irreparably damage the fragile

tundra and its wildlife. The best way to ,

ensure that the refuge is fully protected

SKIBBA

THEPIITNEWS

from this potentially disastrous damage is
to designate it as official wilderness.

Many fragile ecosystems containing
a unique and vast array of wildlife exist
in therefuge. It is home to many species
of ‘ plants as well as many kinds of

wildlife like polar and grizzly
bears, musk oxen, 180 species
A of birds, dall sheep, moose,
wolves and caribou. They live
in the majestic mountains,
_ A . ,, beautiful rivers and plains that
can be seen everywhere in the refuge.

The l29,000—member Porcupine
River Caribou Herd migrates hundreds of
miles from Canada’s Yukon Territory to
give birth to its young in the coastal plain
each year.

This herd sustains almost ' 10,000
Gwich’in Indians, who rely on the cari-
bou for food, clothing, tools and many
other needs. The Gwich’in people have
lived in the refuge for over 20,000 years
and depend on the caribou for their way
of life.

Oil wells, derricks and pipes would
inevitably affect the migration of the cari-
bou that survive and irrevocably harm the
Gwich’in and their culture. Thus, drilling
in the refuge is a human rights issue as
well as an environmental one.

Oil drilling would do nothing to aid
us in the current supposed energy crisis,

  

since only a very small supply could be '

obtained and would not be available for
another 10 years. 1

In terms of the California electricity
shortage, oil drilling would not be a plau-
sible solution since the state generates
less than 1 percent of its electricity from
oil. ‘ .

Our dependence on foreign oil would
not decrease, nor would our gas and oil
prices. We could save a much larger
amount of oil than could be cumulatively
extracted from the refuge by improving
the fuel efﬁciency of cars and trucks by
one mile‘ per gallon for one year.

The Bush administration should
encourage an investigation of cleaner
fuels and alternative sources of energy
rather than ruin a natural treasure only to
obtain — eventually —- a rniniscule oil

supply. The stance of the Bush adrninis- .

tration is misguided at best, since it is
based on a short—tenn solution that can-
not possibly succeed. ‘

. The fate of the U.S. environmental
and energy policy for the next decade
will be determined in Congress this sum-
mer, when refuge oil drilling will be dis-
cussed. The decision will undoubtedly
shape Congress’ approach to related
issues in the future.

has introduced the Energy Security Bill,

which promotes oil drilling in the
Refuge. -

Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., has introduced the Arctic
Wilderness Bill, with Reps.- Edward
Markey, D-Mass., and Nancy Johnson,
R—Conn., introducing a similar bill in the
House. These bills are an important envi-
ronmental initiative that would perma-
nently protect the refuge from oil devel-
opment.

Since all the bills will be debated and  

Voted upon in a few months, it is essen-
tial that we continue to pressure Sen.
Arlen Specter, R—Pa., and Reps. Michael
Doyle, D-Swissvale, and Frank Mascara,
D—Char1eroi, with letters and calls to,
oppose any legislation that involves oil
drilling in the refuge and to support the
refuge’s protection.

The prospect of a massive oil drilling
and industrial development scheme
threatens the last great arctic wilderness.
The oil industry‘ effectively advocates
sacriﬁcing the splendor of the coastal
plain for a short-tenn, questionable sup-
ply of oil. We cannot allow this to hap-

People should respect the feelings beneath the fur

Animals feel pain. If you are not already familiar
with this concept, then please familiarize yourself with
it. Animals, like those seemingly threatening guard
dogs, German shepherds, are defenseless and scared
when confronted with violence.

If you were a defenseless child again and an adult
started screaming at you for no justiﬁable reason, fear
would turn your stomach and make your body tremble.
An animal is no different from a defenseless child who
can be damaged internally and externally by violence
and neglect.

Does this sound like a lecture? It probably is, and if
you are still reading I thank you because that means you
are either a person who respects animals and doesn’t
need this lecture, a person who wants to respect 

and needs some persuading or simply a “person who‘5 '

neglect. If you fall into the latter category, you especial-

Food, water and shelter are the basic necessities of
life. If you deprive an animal in your care of any of

these necessities, you are being abusive and neglectful.‘
If you are discovered and reported to a 

organization, you can be charged with a felony in 31
states and a misdemeanor in the others. '

This alone should not be reason enough to search
for humanity within yourself. First you must think of
that calico cat or terrier that is hungry or dehydrated,
who will probably still offer you affection in the after-
noons when you arrive home from school or work.

Animal neglect and abuse are not only immoral but
are disgusting and horrendous acts of cruelty. My stom-
ach is in knots just thinking of all those supposedly “civ-

an appalling crime.

These are some of the most ugly and detestable
people and should be severely punished by law. If you
are one of my respectful and sensitive readers who does
not need lecturing, please report any of

If you carmot meet the above requirements, then
you should not have an animal in your care. Please
‘either change or contact one of thevhumane organiza-
tions I listed above. If you are a prospective pet owner
and cannot meet these conditions, then don’t get an ani-
mal. .

I have a few more things to say. Getting a black kit-
ten on Halloween is just about the stupidest and most
irresponsible thing you can do. Have bet-
ter sense than that. Would you just ran-
domly adopt a child on Mother’s or
Father’s Day? ‘

Also, if you have an outdooricat, get
him or her spayed or neutered. Help pre-
vent the animal population problem instead of being a
huge part of it. Most of those kittens won’t even survive
until adulthood. And, yes, you have to neuter a male cat
because although he might not be able to have kittens

himself, it does take two cats of opposite sexes to create A

those cute little kittens.

Be smart. Be sensitive. Be respectful. Be responsi-
ble. I believe that humanity can be found within all of us
and vicious cycles can be broken. I don’t care if you
learned violence from your parents, it is not too late to
end that cycle. Real, ﬂouiishing lives can be destroyed.

Think about those lives, those animals, the next time

you clench your list or begin to scream.

Think about them and then please pursue help for
your problem. If. you do not have this problem then you
should share similar words with people who do.

Delicatessen

Bare Wire
Eristikos Records

tit

MELISSA BALICK
Staff Writer ’

“I know I said I’m ﬁne, but I lied,”

Bare W1re’s only member Simone Gray
sings desperately on Delicatessens 42-
second first track, “Verisimilitude.”
This desperation does not let up one bit

during thenext 14 tracks of this unusu-_

al album that has a creepy way of work-
ing into your soul.

Delicatessen is a sparse, haunting
and at times unspeakably beautiful
album, perfect for late night brooding
after a terrible breakup. Most songs

clock in under two minutes, and a good
deal are less than one minute long. Each
brief track exudes thick angst;,the lyrics
contain a great deal of pleading with a
lover. In “Water Glass,” Gray wails,
“Please don’t break me.” In “Airport,”
she sings “Please, please hold me  oh
God, please don’t let go of me here.”
The only lyrics to “Small Unimportant
Requests” are “Oh, have mercy, have
mercy, mercy _on me.”

._Gray’s voice evokes Tori Amos at
her most desperate, but unlike that pop
goddess, this album is never meant for
casual listening. Backed only by an
electric bass and the occasional gothic
keyboard, the songs have no beat, nor
do they have any discernible melody.

Each track sounds about the same
as the next, but it doesn’t matter
because these tracks feel more like
prayers or chants than true songs. In
fact, at the start of each track, I felt
almost surprised that the vocals were in
English; the music sounds so foreign

"minutes. But the vocal part

and otherworldly, I expected
not to understand the words
on more than an emotional
level. A
“Court Adjournment,” the
alburn’s closing track, goes on
for an uncharacteristic nine

stops shortly into the song,
ending Delicatessen with sev-
eral minutes of sparse, moody
keyboards and bass guitar. It
sounds like the soundtrack to

a frightening psychological
thriller, just as the
d e t e c t i V e ,
finds ‘the M — _ r I 
killer’ s ' - - ‘
 1-     Isten
and looks it, ~’ B
through all the ‘
creepy stuff he’s got there.

Bare Wire certainly makes great
mood music ﬁt to scare the kiddies on
Halloween or to play in the background

  

on a stormy night when you feel like
brooding. But it also holds some real
emotional strength. No one listening to
Simone Gray’s gorgeous but frantically
hopeless vocals could possibly think
she’s just kidding around.

The Slim Prescription
The Orgasmic Sound Explosion

Although they are seniors in high
school ready to depart for separate col-

leges in the fall, Pittsburghers Mark Bisi _

and Matt Stidle have grand plans for their
band.

“We’re both going to create solo
albums,” Stidle said, “and then put them
together to make an orgasmic sound
explosion.”

Don’t be fooled by the duo’s -stated
plan. Just because they say they’re going
to create an orgasmic sound explosion
doesn’t mean they haven’t already. The
band’s recent album, The Slim
Prescription, serves up a heady and eclec-
tic mix of synthesized music that will
hook its listeners and keep them addicted.

The album kicks off with “One
Nation Under Synthesized Cowbell,”
which starts with the melody to the
National Anthem, but merges into a
smooth, sophisticated and completely
unexpected beat. '

Is there
anybody out
there?

 I ’ V1.13‘

  

Kenneth Paul

Roger Waters once asked in a Pink
Floyd song, “Is there anybody out
there?”

The school year has passed, and
there is only a fraction of students
remaining, because thousands have
returned home.

Students have a vast number of rea-
sons to remain on campus for the sum-
mer. Some actually take classes and hold

~ down internships. Other students plan to

just enjoy the summer and work at a
restaurant or some other type of job that
affords one plenty of leisure time. Most,

' I suspect, just don’t want to go home

because doing so relinquishes some of
the spoils and freedom that living on
campus encompasses.

My reasons are mixed. I have an
internship and I’m waiting tables, but the
main reason is that it’s just not as fun
returning to my shanty back home in
Philly as it is here in luxurious down-
town Oakland.

Sports-wise, Pitt baseball and soft-
ball just ﬁnished up their seasons — the
baseball team finished under .500 and
the softball team  well, let’s just say it
was a rough season.

In retrospect, although superﬁcially
it looked like another mediocre year in
Pitt ﬁsports, good things did happen,
which makes next year exciting.

For those of you young’ins here for
ATR sessions, our football team beat the
poo out of Penn State, en route to win-
ning seven games and going to a bowl
game.

There is actually optimism sur-
rounding this year’s club, and for the ﬁrst
time in years there are expectations for
the team. Although he has been a bad
boy lately, Pitt wide receiver Antonio

Bryan Knight, once a 190-pound
wide receiver, is a marked man. He is
now on the “Watch List” for the
Lombardi award, an award presented
to the nation’s top lineman or line-
backer.

Last year’s winner, Jamal
Reynolds, led the Florida State
Seminoles to the Championship game
before his team lost to Oklahoma.
Reynolds, a 6-foot-4, 255-pound
defensive end, was recently taken
withthe10th pick of the NFL draft by
the Green Bay Packers.

Knight is one of 52 candidates for
the award, one of eight in the Big
East. ‘

Knight, who was named the
nation’s most improved player by
ESPN.com, started every game in the

, last two seasons. Not only did he set

a Big East record with 26 tackles for
losses, he also ranked second in the

Engel pitches his way to Big East honors

KENNETH PAUL

Sports Editor

Pitt pitcher Joe Engel was named
to the All-Big East third team this
week, the first pitcher in Pitt’s histo-

ry to earn the honor.

Engel, a transfer from Gulf
Coast Community College, led the
pitching staff with five victories this
season.

Head coach Joe Jordano said
Engelmade great strides throughout
the season to improve and that his
work ethic opened the eyes of some
of the younger hurlers.

“I think he really came a long

way since the beginning of the sea- ..
son,” Jordano said. “His breaker and
change-up improved, and when the
younger pitchers saw him develop as
he did, they understood what it took
to get better.” '

The junior right-hander, who.
hails from South Williamsport, Pa.,
finished with an impressive 1.92
ERA, which was good for 15th in the
NCAA and second in the Big East
behind Notre Dame’s Aaron
Heilman. Heilman' was voted as the
conference’s Pitcher of the Year.

“We were banged up from the
start of the season, and we lost a lot
of our offense, which made us rely
more upon our pitching,” Jordano

. , . ; . , i

said. “He really stepped up and did a
great job for us.” '

Engel surrendered 26 runs dur-
ing the season, yet only 13 were
earned. His 59 1/3 inningspitched
led the team, which finished with a
18-27 record.

Engel held opposing hitters to a
.212 batting average, which was
good for fourth place in the Big East.
Healso pitched six complete games,
placing third in the conference.

Engel seemed to get even better
down the stretch of the season, as he
led the team to its only two victories
in its final 11 games. .

On April 28, Engel pitched nine
shutout innings against a Rutgers

team that was 34-13 at the time.
Engel spread out seven hits in the
game and struck out eight batters in
the 8-0 win. '

He pitched another complete
game in Pitt’s last victory of the sea-

‘son, striking out six batters in a 4-1

victory over Virginia Tech.

“If we had a better season, I real-
ly believe that he would have made
the first team,” Jordano said.

Dealing with nagging injuries all
season, the Panthers’ pitching staff
ranked fifth in conference games
with a 4.48 ERA and were led by
Engel, who finished with 69 strike-
outs, placing him ninth on Pitt’s all—
time single-season list.

Almost two mgnths of baseball
are in the books and so far, the
Phillies and Twins are in first place
and there’s a guy pounding the ball
in St. Louis but his name doesn_’t
end with McGuire. ‘

For many fans, along with the
season comes fantasy baseball. If
you’re the guy whose computer
start-up page is the ESPN.com
baseball scoreboard, if you’re con-
stantly looking for a stud to be
called up from the minors or if you
track a pitcher’s production —
inning by inning — then you’re one
of the freaks that loves this stuff.

Hitters

The biggest surprise to date_has
been St. Louis Cardinal Albert
Pujols.’ The rookie has taken the
National League by storm and he
can play almost any position. Pujols
is batting .363 with 14 homers and
44 RBIs. ‘There have been plenty of
other surprises in
the National
League.

Colorado ’ s
Neifi Perez is
batting .348.
When thinking
of a catcher in
the NL, Mike‘
Piazza’s name comes
to mind.

However, he hasn’t been able to
really find his bat this seasonpand in
most fantasy leagues, Piazza is
pricey. Florida’s Charles Johnson
is a mid—priced player and he’s bat-
ting .323 with 11 home runs. Ben
Davis is also an option, especially
if you need an inexpensive player.’

Shortstop Rich Aurilia is on a
tear for the Giants, as he is sporting
an NL-leading .385 average.
Houst~on’s Lance ‘Berkman has
been another surprise this season, as
he is toward the top of every statis-
tical category.

Berkman is reaping the benefits
of batting behind Jeff Bagwell, as
he is batting .361 and is fifth in the
league in walks, with 33.

In the American League, pick
any player from the Cleveland
Indians lineup.

The team leads the’ AL with a
.301 team batting average, 256 runs
and 249 RBIs. Juan Gonzalez has
shown that hep;-is happy to ‘be out of
Detroit by posting a .360 average
and 42 RBIs. Batting in the sixth
spot is Marty Cordova who is bat-
ting .377 with eight homers and
behind him is Russ Branyan who

  

AT

has 10 home runs but has struck out
48 times, good for second in the
AL.

Other good bets in the AL are
Seattle’s Ichiro Suzuki and Bret
Boone. Boone has been solid at sec-
ond base, batting .317 with eight
homers. Suzuki, a god in his native
Japan, is hitting .365 with 15 stolen
bases. ,

Two guys that were on fire but
have since cooled down are the
Twins’ Doug Mientkiewicz and the
Royals’ Mark Quinn. Quinn’s bat-

-ting average has dropped over 100

points in the past month, from .406
to .288. ' ‘

Pitchers ,

Of course there are the usual
suspects continuing to dominate.
But there_are also some fresh faces
who are becoming successes on the
mound.

What a shocker! Pedro
Martinez is dominating. Martinez’s
always worth his cost, the Cy Young
Award winner leads the majors with
a 1.52 ERA and has ‘only given up
one home run this season.

Kevin Brown leads
the NL with his 1.86 ERA
and Randy Johnson
continues to ,mow
down
scorching 111 foes
so far.

    

D
In ALL The

e have to be missing
Mike Hampton, who was signed
away by Colorado. Hampton is 6-1,
with a modest 2.80 ERA.
Meanwhile in New York,the two
players that were supposed to
replace Hampton are struggling.
Steve Trachsel has given up. 13
home runs and is 1-6 and Kevin
Appier is 2-5, with a 5.62 ERA.

There are plenty of other strug-
gling pitchers out there.
Helling is 1-6 for the underachiev-
ing Texas Rangers, Helling’s 7.19
ERA is just two points lower than
that of the Giants’ Livan
Hernandez.

If you’re looking for solid
pitching, go check out the Twins’
pitching rotation. Brad Radke is
tied with Arizona,’s Curt Schilling
for most wins in the majors, with
seven. Rookie Joe Mays has ‘six
wins and a 2.67 ERA and Eric
Milton is 5-3 with a 3.48 ERA.

Schilling is not only tied for the
lead in «wins but he also ranks sec-
ond_in the NL with 84:strikeo'uts in
75 1/3 inningsvof work. Two young
guns Matt Morris of the Cardinals

-and Wade Milleriiof Houston also

have six victories. Morris’, 2.32

Nine of Knight’s teammates will
rejoin the defense, looking to
improve upon those statistics.
Knight’s season high in tackles came

against Virginia Tech, the game that .

saw Pitt lose a heartbreaker, 37-34.
He racked up 12 tackles in the defeat.

Pitt legend Hugh Green is the
only Panther to ever win the award,

which he did after the 1980 season.

The award will be announced Dec. 5
in Houston.

Pitt opens its 2001 season at its
new home against East Tennessee

Bryant is a legitimate Heisman Trophy
candidate. The defense is stacked, with

stars Ramon Walker and Bryan Knight ’

returning, and there will be no quarter-
back controversy — it is David
Priestley’s job to lose.

Head coach Walt~Harris had his best
recruiting performance to date. He stole

’ "many recruits away from regional*power-

houses, such as Penn State, West Virginia
and Ohio State.

Next season the team moves into a
brand-new stadium on the North Shore,
and the basketball team, who made it to
the Big East Championship game, is
scheduled to move into the Petersen
Events Center this winter.

With no sporting action going on at
Pitt, it was up to the Penguins to leave
their mark on Pittsburgh’s 2001 summer,
because it’s pretty safe to say that the
Pirates will not.

The Pirates’ new ballpark, PNC
Park, is absolutely magniﬁcent and worth
checking out, but the action inside is

absolutely miserable. And it is way too.

early in the summer to start bashing the
Steelers but come on  signing Scott

Mitchell as the backup to Kordell Stewart

looks like nothing more than a serious
investment in next year’s No. 1 draft pick
in the NFL draft. -
