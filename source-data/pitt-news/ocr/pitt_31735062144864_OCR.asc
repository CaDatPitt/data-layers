SUMMER EVENING
COURSE ON JUNE l8

augurated this summer in the down-
town division of the university, ac-
cording to F. W. Shockley, director

vision. "

The courses are offered as a re-
sult of responses to_a recent ques-
tionnaire which indicate that_ ap-
proximately 350 students are willing

The summer evening session will
enable a large number of students
now taking work in the downtown
division evening school and working
to“-«.ml their degrees to supplement
their courses with several courses in
the summer session. The time re-
quired to get the degree will there-
fore be shortened considerably, says
Shockley. In addition, there ‘will be
a number of regular university stu-
dents who will be able to work dur-
ing the summer and take courses in
the evening in the new session.

Courses to be offered in the ses-
sion include elexnentary and ad-;
vanced accounting. business law.
marketing, elementary and advanced
economics, elementary and advanced
ﬁnance, English composition and lit-
erature. history, political science,
sociology, psychology and modern
languages.

The evening will be divided into
periods with classes scheduled for
each period. The first period will be-
gin at 6:05 o'clock and the second at
7:50 o’clock.

The session will be under the su-
pervision of the extension division
and Dr. Wesley Vincent Lanfear. di-
rector of the downtown division.

MODERN STUDENT NOT CURIOUS,
THINKS COLUMBIA PROFESSOR

"Though.the modern college stu-
dent has less curiosity than he had
a few years ago, he's a pretty ﬁne
fellow at that,” was the opinion of
Prof. John Erskine in an interview
last Tuesday. Galahad would be
typical of youth today if he were in
college. Of course, things would
have to be changed a great deal.
Yet Galahad did not belong to

Main Street. He had more than the
usual emotional intensity; his wit
was. ready, his manners nice, and
his ambitions good,”- Erskine added.

Erskine is interested in the col-

lege student from a vocational
standpoint -as a professor in the
English department at Columbia

University. This interest has led
him to observe closely the experi-
mental methods of Prof. Alexander
Meiklejohn at Wisconsin. In his
opinion Meil-rlejohn’s methods are a
reversion to the old medieval type

of teaching. _“Francis Bacon ob-
jected to this method because it did
not allow for the proper study of
scientiﬁc subjects. Meiklejohn seeks
more intimate discussion between in-
structor and student. But what dis-

cussion is necessary in a scientiﬁc
experiment? None, you must work
out the experiment. Meiklejohn is
just_a bit too careful in ex riment-
ing in those ﬁelds in which 's meth-
ods work,” he opined.

_“Wom_an,” says Erskine, “was
originally sophisticated. Speakin
in terms of my own book Adam an
Eve, Lillith was more so histicated
than Eve, but Eve's tec ique al-
lowed her ‘to triumph ﬁnally. Adam
was a man, just like you and me.
I’m afraid his naivete will be en-
during,” he concluded. ,

Erskine looks up his writing as
an‘avocat1on. _“I always wanted to
write,” he said. “That's the rea-

son I became a teacher.

VOCATIONAL GROUP
cONi=ERs ON PLANS

Favor L a r g e, Assemblies
Instead Of Small
I Conferences

 

Meeting in the ﬁrst of a series of
discussions to plan for the annual
vocational. g u i d a n c e conference
scheduled for this spring, the voca-

— tional guidance committee recently

approved by Student Council con-
vened Friday.

Discussion of the nature of the
conferences and the advisability of
printing and distributing pamphlets
for use in connection with the con-

the meeting, which was in charge of

James W. Sloan, ’28, chairman of
the committee; Possibility of a
change in conference plans over
those of last year is see_n in the at-
titude of committee members favor-
ing the appearance here of a na-
tionally known speaker to lead the
conference assembly.

Vocational guidance conferences
for the past several years have been
featured with numerous small group
assemblies and meetings at which at-
tendance was small, Sloan points
out. He favors the appearance of
one, for possibly two, prominent
speakers 1 who will speak‘ before a
large University assembly. The use
of ,pam,ph—lets, to serve as data for
students who attend the conferences
is aplan which. has never been in
effect at former vocational confer-
ences. .

INDIVIDUAL srunr  
NEEDED FOR CRIME

Dr‘? A Root Stresses. Separate
" Analysis at Study
Forum

 

 

_ Individual analysis is the only
fair way to deal with crime at pres_-
ent, believes Dr. William T. Root
professor:.of psychology, who opened
the firstnieeting of the psychology
forum last week with a talk on
“Qasa Study and the Statistical
Method as an approach to the prob-
lem -of crime.”

The greatest value of -criminal
statistics is to give a general View
of‘ the causes and trends, found in
criminals, Dr. Root pointed out.
There is conflict between the indi-
vidual case method and‘ the statis-
tical method with the result that
crime statistics are less dependable
than those in any other ﬁeld, he
said. Because of the unreliability of
statistics pertaining to the number
of caught and uncaugbt criminals,
the type of criminal caught and con-
victed, the differences in criminal
laws, many problems confront in-
vestigators dealing with the indi-
vidual crime case. \ g

In individual case study the indi-
vidual becomes a unit of analysis
and each factor attributed as the
cause: «of: a, crime -must be considered
with a] other factors ‘of a speciﬁc
case: ~ ' " -rsappearance,-.liealth,»
mentality, emotional. make‘-up,‘ de-
velopment, history, education and
vocation must all be considered in
crime analysis in the individual»casI_e
method, said Dr. Root. And’ statis-
tics in crime if reﬁned would be of
great value in ‘administrative poli-
cies, he maintains.

-“All the modern writers are sin-

cere and are in love with life; but
they won't write ‘Pollyanna’ stories
because, todo so, would be intel-
lectuall ' dishonest,” argues Pro-
fessor ohn Erskine in his lectureon
“The Moral Obligation To Be In-
telligent at the Y. M. and W. H. A.
last Tuesday evening. _
_ “It is an insult to the American
intelligence for writers to paint pic-
tures which show only the good and
ideal side of life and leave out the
sordid and bad because they know
little of this side,” he added. Ers-
kine would rather have both» sides
drawn and have the writer and the
reader solve the problem of the im-
moral side together. '

He deplored the fact that none of
the American and English writers
ask_ us to admire the virtue of in-
telligence. As an example he’ took
Shakespe_are’s Othello. “I admire
Desidemona, Othello and Cassio,” he

The rest are not.intelligent. Shake-
speare must have thought that if
you had brains and know human na-
ture you were a bad man." Ers-

kine stated that the Greekinﬁuence

was returning not only in our art
and dances, but also in our manner
of thinking. To the Greek it was
a moral obligation to be intelligent.
In Greek society every normal man
was expected to know the differ-
ence ‘between ood and bad. To do
right accidenty ‘was as much a
crime as to do wrong accidently.
“Ignorance. backed by a moral pur-
pope is unpardonable.”

‘The problem of the novelist to-
day lies in choosing the type of
story he should write,” sai.d Ers-
kine. “He can write the fairy story
where everything good happens and
nothing bad occurs. Children like

which had four attorneys, two doc-

Of all the chancellors of the Uni-

which was composed of most exec -

eighteen persons. If the janitor and
his assistant were added there were
twenty.

On becoming Chancellor, Dr. Hol-

ENROLLMENT TOTAL
SHOULD PASS LAST
YEAR’S, SAYS QUICK

In an enrollment equalling and
perhaps exceeding the total neten-’
rollment of the school year 1926-7,
more than 10,000‘ students will be
registered in the university, pres-
ent registration figures indicate,
states J. G. Quick, egistrar. -

Approximately ,963 students.
were ‘enrolled in undergraduate
schools at the close of the ﬁrstweek
of the second semester including 531'
students entering for first time. Ad-
ditional registration by special and
graduate students which closed Sat-
urday will swell the low number of
such students who were registered
during the first Saturday of_ this
semester when weather conditions
were inclement, states Quick.

I The distribution of the total num-
ber of students as enrolled by
schools totals 1,912 students for
the college. The school_ of educa-
tion is next with 922 registered stu-
dents. Students enrolled in other
schools are for the school of busi-
ness administration, 573, school of
engineering, 342, school of mines, 83.
The number of students. regis

in the graduate school is 662 and
the down town division total! .1.-
469 students.

The total of 5,963 students en-
rolled at second semester does not
include the professional schools to
which very few students are atl-
mitted at mid-year registration,
Quick states. First semester totals
in these schools were 466 for the
school of dentistry, 442 ‘ for the
pharmacy school, 260 registered 
the law school and 254 students in
the school of medicine. _

the age of jazz? - . .

Hopelessly I turned from the piano, and my eyes fell upon the

were heaped on Erskine when he

writer would go into great detail as

to the number of kisses and their“

mark for the 100-yard event in the

“Pal o the Aqua,” came through to
win the 150-yard backstroke event
in excellent form, coupled with good
time.” Besides winning this event
with such ease, this versatile little

With the loss of Pete ’B.o.,Wen, best
