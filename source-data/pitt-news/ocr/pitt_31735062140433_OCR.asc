 45 Pledges This Week

Fifty-ﬁve pledges of Pitt Riﬂes,
honorary military -society, became

. victims of “hell” week Monday-—

but “hell without heck1ing.”
Lieutenant Howard Husband, as-
sistant professor of military sci-

ence and tactics, said. that this year A

the pledge week will consist entire-
ly of military discipline and train-

 ing with little or very restricted

“heckling.”

The oﬂicial ruling states that no
active may haze a pledge in any
way unless he is in uniform and
does so in pledge headquarters.

‘ During the week, pledges should

wear their uniforms every day, be,

‘_ present for roll call every morning
at 7:30 o'clock, carry various
equipment for the “pleasure of the
actives,” and report to pledge head-
quarters every tree hour. ‘

Edward Lundell, C43, is pledge
captain, and his assistants are:

Robert Burford, E44, pledge ﬁrst

lieutenant; Robert Page, C44,

Disagree on Morale‘ A

By ALBERT MAVRINAC

, The exact state of student morale at the University, con-
sidered vital to any all-out defense effort, remained undeter-
mined today as administrators, faculty, and students failed

to agree.
Dr. Einar W’.

Jacobsen, dean of the School of Education and head

of the council, reiterated his belief that morale at Pitt among students
and faculty members was not only good, but was very high.

Mitchell Resigns
Library Position

The resignation of Eleanor Mitch-
ell, ﬁnearts librarian, will become
effective this week when she leaves

to prepare for her new work in

Mexico. ~
Undertaking an American Li-

brary association project under a.

grant from the Rockefeller founda-
tion, Miss Mitchell will assist in the
organization of Biblioteca Publica.
del Estado de Jalisco at Guadala-
jara, Mexico. In this one year’:
project atiithe library, connected
with the University of Guadalajara,
she will help to prepare a catalogue
of over 100,000 volumes of valu-
able art material and aid in the
training of Mexican library assist-
ants. _

With the University since No-
vember; 1937, Miss Mitchell also
taught a course in history of art
this past year. She was graduated
from New Jersey College for Wom-
en and Columbia University Art
school, then received her Master
of Arts degree at Smith college.

In 1936. she was an assistant in
an American girls’ art school in
Florence, Italy, doing everything
from teaching and supervising, and
working on ait work of her own. to
helping supervise the meals for the
girls in the school. -

Men's Lounge“ Replaces
Eighth Floor-Tuck Shop

The eighth ﬂoor men-’s tuck shop
will be closed “on or about” Satur-
day, February 14, and a men’s
lounge will take its place, the dean
of men’s office announced today.

To provide the same eating fa-
cilities, the oldest tuck shop on the

ground floor will be converted into

a men’s ‘tuck shop. Formerly under

» the dean of men's office the new
men's tuck shop will be under the
guidance of the University's cafe-
teria.

Thedore W. Biddle, acting dean
of men, said that the change is be-
ing made at the suggestions of the
Student’-Faculty association, anrl
Men’s council that the change
would alleviate elevator loads dur-
ing lunch hours and eliminate the
congestion on the floor during this
perid.

Basing his opinion on what he
termed a “redeﬁnition of student
morale,” Dr. Jacobsen said he
could see only the problem of les-
sening student worry and fear over

V the present crisis as being in any
way threatening.

But the optimistic attitude of the
University defense head was not
shared by other persons at Pitt.

Many students and even some
faculty members have bemoaned
what they consider an indifferent

student attitude toward the con-
ﬂict.

It is admitted that morale as a
whole was unusually high imme-
diately after the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor. But it was main-
tained that student minds have bec-
come depressed in recent weeks,
particularly ‘following the Roberts
Honolulu expose. '

Main argument of the doubters

4 is the failure of the student Red

Cross drive to attain its goal of

$1,500, based on an individual stu-
dent contribution of 25 cents.

Dr. Jacobsen pointed out that
the Pittsburgh. ,,,Red Cross drive
had, perhaps unwisely, announced
success early last Tuesday and be
blamed the failure of students to
contribute on this “premature an-
nouncement.” ‘

Even if true, critics insist that
it would have been virtually impos-
sible to raise $800 in one day.

All the pro and con arguments
are making life difﬁcult for the
special Student “ Morale committee
headed by Dr. John W. Oliver, pro-
feisor of history, which must now
decide if there is or is not such’:
thing as student morale.

Reports saythat committee mem-
bers are puzzled as to their course
of action, but some seem to be
leaning toward the “nothing wrong”
attitude, considered deﬁnitely dan-
gerous by many outside the com-
mittee.

n

identiﬁcation cards of new stu-
dents and of those students who
had new pictures taken may be
obtained from the dean of men’s
office, 809 Cathedral, any time
this week.

Delenise Group
Starts Drive 4
For Battleship

By WILLIAM PANKUCH _ '_
A concerted effort to obtain vol-

unteers to aid in ‘the battleship
drive is being initiated today by
members of the Defense Stamp’
committee, and will continue
through next Wed/nesday.

After approximately five weeks
of intensive organizing and ,p‘ub-~
licizing, work necessary for the
drive has grown to such propor-
tions as to require the assistance
of more students. Actual stamp ,"
sales will begin in about two weeks.

lnlan appeal to the “many‘/cap-
«able students who are not engag-
ed in activities,” Aldo Icardi, C43, ;
assistant chairman, requests that ,
“those who Want to do their pa1't'7'
get behind this drive. This does"
not exclude men and women who '
have other activities, Icardi added. '

Bank forms that may be ﬁlled
out by volunteers are now available
in the offices of the dean of men and‘
of the dean of women. Several’
types of services are open to any
student.

 

 

The volunteer work is classiﬁed,
as national publicity, local publi-
city, stamp sales, poster design, "
and secretarial work. Some posi-.
tions may seem more attractive _
than others, but all are important
in accomplishing the aims of the
committee, lcardi said.‘ i

A fncitlierr Reason 4

,_ Another reason why the drive might have

Birmingham and Baltimore. The National
Research council debated this apparently dis-
criminatory attitude, and ﬁnally decided to
30' 310mg’ with the Army and: Navy since. it

was wartime. And the Red«Cross followed
suit. - .  '

Thus the blame -does not lie wholly with »

the Red ‘Cross,’ rather it~lies on the shoulders
of the Army and Navy, whose discriminatory
prejudices in such matters are well known
and greatly abhorred, and also upon the Na-
tional Research council which should have
refused such discrimination, being a scien-
tiﬁc body. I A .

.For-,, as far ..as all medical and scientiﬁc
eyidénce shows, there is i1oldiffere1ic_e§be-
tween"‘Negro blood and White ‘blood. There
is no such thing as ‘Negro’ blood.

 All, the Same

All blood is ‘basicallyﬂthe same, except for
certain chemical properties in the plasma,
which can be divided into four groups. The
blood itself can be divided- into two main
constituents-—the serum and the plasma. All
serum is chemically the same, no matter
whether it is in Negroes or Whites. And the
plasma contains the only properties which
differentiates one blood from another, that
is, the four groups. ‘ .

But these four groups are exactly the same
in all people, Negro or White. Group I ina
Negro is exactly the same as Group I in a
White person. Group II, Group III, Group IV
are thefsarne in both Negro and White.

The survival of democracy depends on’ the
breakdown of unscientiﬁc race ‘prejudice.
Hitler would be ca.pable of just this kind of

‘prejudice. The US Army and Navy are

pledged to ﬁght Hitlerism. They aren’t‘going
to win by adopting Hitlerian tactics such as

Negro prejudice. .

Prejudice of this kind can easily break the
morale of the American people. Everybody
won’t be like the young. Negro girl, whose

’ friend had been refused the privilege’ of giv-_

ing his blood for his fellow man, and who, at
ﬁrst angry about giving anything to the Red
Cross War fund, bro-u.ght in her money later,
saying “Ican be bigger than they are.”

»,'fAtl1letic'director James Hagan spoke at a testimonia

banquet given for Jimmy ‘Potts’ last week, and told the 150

»people -present what the University plans to do about the-
freshman ban. District sports fa.ns_were patiently waiting for
thedecision, and Hagan gave it to them, rather frankly and

to the point. _. : ' f ‘ .

- " “Only7as a last risort would Pitt abandon the freshman
rule,’.’ ‘Hagan was quoted assaying. There has been quite a bit
of criticism directed at the Pitt athletic department ,because of,
their stand. The critics point outthat in the last War practically
every school threw the freshman rule overboard.

5:_v':.j-»We tend to‘ side with Hagan. Not because we believe it

wi-llgi. aid sports, nor that the majority of schools Wouldn’t do

~ better in a ﬁnancial way with the aid of the incoming frosh
_ athletes, but we feel it is entirely for the boy’s good.

lg j.}' Every_ freshman uses the first year of his college life to

~or_ient himself to his surroundings, ,teachers,and newly found

classmates. Why shouldn’t the athletes? Surely they need it

as]-inuch ifnot more than the average run—of-the-mine stu-
dent. . . 1 ' I . 
 Pitt didaway with the‘ freshman inter-collegiate competi-
tion several years back for that particular» reason, and to
abolish the freshman non-participation rule, would be to defeat
_. their own purpose. In the present system at Pitt, anathlete has
' more time for himself, and more time to ‘devote to his studies.
‘ . Duquesne University bought the frosh rule question up
before their high command last week, and they quietly seem-

edvto favor it. Their reason for favoring the abolition of the‘

rule seems to lie mainly with their desire of a national ath-

letic rating. ’

; ~ They probably ﬁgure that with freshmen allowed to par-
ticipate in- varsity sports, and theiralumni willing to give
almost anything for a couple of good athletes, it would not
take long for them to reach their goal. But they seemed afraid
~; to" take that initial step until the other colleges do so. '

l V ' If they do, they obviouslythought, and the other, top-
notch Universities of the country did not’, they would not only
have a hard time scheduling games, but would be laughed at
by every big time coach in the nation. So, at the present, they
are playing a waiting game.

Carnegie Tech had no’, other alternative last week than

_”_waive the freshman rule, Their athletic teams have already

 ' eclined to such a_ sub-normal state of affairs that frosh must

} "é allowed"-to participate if the Skibos are to put a team on the
ﬁeld. We seem to admire the Techites for their open stand. ,

I...-_; ',1‘he,Pit~t situation seems, to be quite .different for, at the

l-eseht’ time,‘ they have an abundance of material in all sports.

ere is no need to use freshmen. There is quantity if not

‘iiality. When the time arrives that the University coaches

 not have enough men, then is the time to waive the ban.

 Many people ,haven’t thought of what would happen

' ' ;hen the colleges do away with the rule. A school,vfor§{‘;example,

career came during his sophomore

Virginia basketball. s‘quad

into the Stadium pavillion to-
nightto do battle with Doc
Carlson’s newly inspired floor
ﬁve. ' ' "

This is the season’s third visit
to the smoky city for the Mountain
bred basket tossers. In two pre-
vious local invasions, the West Vir-'
ginians lost a bang-up battle to
Duquesne and barely managed to

squeeze through to a Tartan tri-
umph. ,

Coach Dyke Raese stresses the
3-2 Iman offense, and has a trio of
.very capable bank board sharp-
sters. Rudy Baric and ‘Dick Kes-
ling share top-man scoring honors,
having met the ‘basket for a total
of 88 points so far this season.

Pudgy, peppy, and pugnacious
Floyd “Scotty” Hamilton, with ﬁf-
ty-four markers to his credit, holds
fourth place in the Mountaineer
individual scoring race.

Roger Hicks and Lou Kelmar will
probably be the two other Hill Billy
starters in the lineup. Carlson has
indicated that he will counter with
his usual opening gun quintet. That
means that Larry Paffrath, “Lefty”
Ziolkowski, Jim Egan, Tay Ma-
larkey, and Bob Artman, will again
be drafted for ﬂoor service against
the mountaineers. ‘

In addition to the Carnegie Tech
victory and the -
 West Virginia's record shows vic-
tories over Geneva College, Mary-
land, Youngstown, Penn State, and
West Virginia Wesleyan.

Dick Kesliia g has scored 47 points
in the last two games for the
Mountaineers. Tea-med against
Larry Paﬁrath, Pitt’s pluperfect
point producer, the two should put
on quite a‘ scoring battle for the
amusement of the spectators.

The Carlsonmen will be seeking
to break the 500 average. After the
West Virginia encounter, the Pan-
thers have yet to meet Indiana
State Teachers and Westminster,
at the Stadium, and. Geneva, Car-
negie Tech, Penn State, and Army
on the respective opposing courts.

Predicted’ by Professors

Postwar changes in social struc-

placeafter the fall of the Roman
empire were predicted by two his!
tory instructors today. . A
A new era in social structure will
be one of the results of the present
World "cogiﬂict, according to Dr.
John J. Geise, associate professor
of history, and Dr. T. R. Parker,-

\ lecturer in history.

Changes ‘which followed the fall
of the Roman empire took place
from the third to the eighth con-
tury, Dr. Geise stated, and the next
transition, Dr. Parker pointed out,
came with the breakdown of the
medieval institutions between 1350
and 1650 AD; . 1‘
Dr. Geise and Dr. Parker agreed
that the changes after‘World War
II will be more rapid than any re-
sults of previous transitions. They
predicted that only two generations
would be required for the expected
social revolution. ‘ 9”
