Schenley Quad to
have dorms rewired

By Julie Shepard

Staff Writer

A three-hour power outage
which affected both Holland and
Amos Halls has prompted univer-
sity officials to request an entire
rewiring of the electrical system
over the Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas holidays. A similar blackout
had affected the entire Schenley
Quadrangle on Nov. 9 — only a
week before this outage.

According to Glenn Schott,
manager of electrical systems for
Pitt, ”A breaker had tripped in the
system, causing Monday's out-
age.” Schott said that this break-
er was to be fixed Friday morning
(Nov. 20) between 5 and 7 a.m.

Schott added that the reason
only Holland and Amos Halls’
electricity went out is that there
are ”split feeders.” When the
power was deliberately shut off
last week, only half of the circuit
was fixed. The other half, which

Report shows Reagan at fault for Iranian arms sa

WASHINGTON -— President .

Reagan contributed to a massive
deception of Congress and of the
public in the Iran-Contra affair
and bears responsibility for

thwarting the law by allowing a.

vestigators report.

In embarrassingly rich detail,
the Iran-Contra report from Con-
gress portrays President Reagan

as a’ leader who repeatedly

controls Holland and Amos, was
what gave out.

Schott said, ”A request has
been put in to rewire the entire
Schenley Quadrangle. The build-

. ings in the Quad, which are ap-

proximately 80 years old, are still
operating with their original wir-
ing and feeders — only the
switches and circuits have been
changed over the years.

”Plans are being made to work
on the system over both the
Thanksgiving and Christmas
breaks,” Schott said. ”However,
the process of renewing the sys-
tem will be a gradual one that
will require the power to be shut
off for planned periods of time.
We can't do all the necessary
work in one shot.”

Smokers urged to

’kick the -habit’

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Staff Writer

Once again this year, the
American Cancer Society will
make a special effort to en-
courage smokers across the coun-
try to take a break from cigarettes
and ”enjoy a fresh breath of life”
for just one day — the Great
American Smokeout, Thursday,
Nov; 19. .

For the seventh consecutive
year, actor Larry Hagman is
presiding as Great American

_Smokeout chairman. He is again

urging smokers to ”make this the
year you kick smoking right out
of your life.”

According to current data from
the American Cancer Society,
about 74 million Americans now
living will eventually have
cancer, and at some point, cancer
will strike approximately three
out of every four families.

Smoking is related to 320,000,‘
deaths annually from cancer of

the lung, mouth, pharynx, larynx,
esophagus, pancreas and bladder
and is also directly related to
other diseases.

The Smokeout is aimed at get-
ting people to quit smoking as a
way of preventing _cancer. Ameri-
can Cancer Society statistics indi-
cate that in the past, it has been
sucessful in achieving this goal."

In 1965, 59 percent of the men
between the ages of 20 and 24

were smokers, and in 1985, this 1
number dropped to 31 percent. ‘

Similarly, in 1965, 9 percent of
the men of this age group had
given up smoking, and in 1985,
the percentage of former smokers
had risen to 11 percent.

Among women ages 20 to 24,
42 percent were smokers in
1965, and in 1985, only 32 per-
cent smoked.

The United Jewish Federa-
tion will be holding a city-
wide youth rally, entitled the
Youth Rally for Soviet Jewry,
and related programs on Sun-
day, Nov. 22, in order to make
the plight of Soviet Jews

I known. In addition, Pittsburgh
city council has declared Nov.
22 ”SovietJewry Day” in the
city.

The rally will begin at 12:15
pm.‘ on Flagstaff Hill. From
here, the march will proceed
to the Jewish Community
Center at 5738 Forbes Ave. A
balloon launch and a program
on the problems of refusniks
(Soviet Jews who have been
denied exit visas for political
or religious reasons) will
follow.

The balloon launch will in-
volve the release of black and
white balloons with ”Free
Soviet Jews” printed on them.

Jewish youth group-to rally

Faith Weinstein, coordinator
of the Pittsburgh Conference
on Soviet Jewry, stated that
black and white balloons will
be used ”because it is‘a black
and white issue.” A

_ Also included in the pro-
gram is a video which ex-
plores the problems of young
Jewish adults in the Soviet Un-
ion. According to Weinstein,
a problem arises with young
adults because they wish to
leave their families and emi-
grate to another country. They
are legally old enough, but the
Soviet government takes the
stance that it does not wish to
divide families. Other areas of
the refusnik issue willbe ex-
plored as well.

_ In addition to making the
public aware of the plight of
the refusniks and protesting
the treatment of these people,
‘the rally is also intended to
-mobilize the public to attend
a nationwide rally to be held

in Washington on Dec. 6, the
eve of the summit with Mik-
hail Gorbachev.

The refusnik issue, said
Weinstein, is ”a human rights
issue, not [just a] Jewish is-
sue,” and -taking a stand on it
is necessary to get results. The
organizers of the Washington
rally are hoping for a turnout -
of 400,000 people, which
would represent the 400,000
Jews in the Soviet Union
awaiting exit visas.

The rally, to be held here on
Sunday, is not, according to
Weinstein, a protest of U.S.
policy. She also stated that the
U.S. government has been
very supportive of human
rights matters and that Secre-
tary of State Shultz has placed
a high priority on the issue of
Soviet Jewry. The rally is in-
tended to be a ”peaceful
demonstration against the
Soviet Union's handling of

refusniks.”

“The second channel turned
out to represent the same Iranian
leaders as did the first channel,"
the report said, and the recipients
of some of the weapons could
hardly be described as mo-
derates. ,

Such developments underscore
the conclusion of Secretary of
State George Shultz that ”Our
guys  got taken to the cleaners,"
the report said. . . _ ’

Pre-summit talks result in decision on treaty

GENEVA —— A treaty scrapping
intermediate-range nuclear
weapons will be ready for sign-
ing next month, U.S. and Soviet
officials said after three days of
pre-summit talks.

The talks laid the groundwork
for President Reagan and Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who are sched-
uled to hold the summit in
Washington Dec. 7 through 10.

”A great deal of progress has
been made over the past three

. days," an American source said

after the pre-summit talks ended
Tuesday. He described the
negotiations as ”very good and
positive."

4 The source, who spoke on con-
dition of anonymity, said negoti-
ators ended the sessions ”with a
great deal of work having been
accomplished, as agreed at the
Oct. 30 meeting" between Secre-
tary of State George P. Shultz and
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the

Soviet foreign minister.

After that meeting, the two
governments announced the
summit plans and said the treaty

would be signed. They also said

Reagan and ‘the Soviet leader
hoped for another summit in
1988 at which they could sign an
agreement on reducing long-
range nuclear forces by 50
percent.

’Heart crisis’ strikes
key Gorbachev foe

MOSCOW — Boris N. Yeltsin,
the ousted boss of the Moscow
Communist Party, has suffered a
”heart crisis,” a government
spokesman said Wednesday.

The announcement by spokes-
man Yuri Gremitskikh came amid
indications that the reform-
minded Yeltsin had lost his last
and most important political post.

Gremitskikh said he could
"categorically deny”. rumors
sweeping Moscow that the

56-year-old Yeltsin has suffered a .

heart attack or died since his
removal from the post of Moscow
party leader last Wednesday.

"I can tell you personally that
Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin is not
well, but he's alive, and other
reports about him are not true,”

ASSOCIATED mass

he told a news briefing.

The tall, hearty Yeltsin was last
seen in public on Nov. 7 when
he attended a Red Square parade
marking the 70th anniversary of
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution
and an official Kremlin reception
that followed. Westerners who at-
tended the reception said Yeltsin
appeared healthy at the time.

Yeltsin was removed from the
Moscow post after Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
brought him to the capital two
years earlier, appeared at a
Moscow party committee meet-
ing last Wednesday to denounce
Yeltsin.

Art market booming ’

despite economies .

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands —
The record prices being paid for
works by Vincent.van Gogh -
who sold only one painting in his

life — are posing potential secu-
rity and insurance problems at
the Van Gogh Museum.

Last week's New York sale of

F Van Gogh's ”|rises” for $53.9

and showed the art market's sta-

HOMESTEAD, Pa. — A public

plans a public inquiry into a pro-

Homestead steel plant to a de-_

amusement park.

’’I’m very concerned that every
possible angle be explored to see
if the mills or any facility that ex-
ists there can be reopened," Mike
Stout, a member of the Steel Val-

The authority also plans to ask
USX to delay the transaction by
90 days to allow time for the
study.

Smoke

Continued from page 1

In 1965, 7 percent of the wom-
en of this age group had given up
smoking, and the percentage rose
to 11 percent in 1985.

The university's new policy on
smoking in public areas may en-
courage some Pitt students to kick
the smoking habit. ”They are
starting to limit smoking space in
all public buildings,” according
to a Hillman Library employee.
The smoking room at Hillman
has been closed for about six
months now.

And if that's ‘ not enough,
maybe college students will fol-

low the example of the Great‘

American Smokeout’s newest
”spokespud,” Mr. Potato Head.
Although ”he started to smoke
the day he was born,” according
to Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, he gave his pipe to the Sur-
geon General on Tuesday and
vowed never to touch it again.

”By kicking the habit, Mr. Pota-
to Head will not only improve his
health but will serve as a good ex-
ample to young people who need
to learn the importance of main-
taining good health habits,” said
First Lady Nancy Reagan, in a
message read by Koop.

In 1987, the American Cancer
Society hopes to match and
perhaps to top the 23.8 million
smokers who tried to kick the
habit during the 1986 Smokeout.

Last year, seven million were
able to make it through the day
without lighting up, and another
16.8 million cut down.

According to Susan Islam,
director of broadcasting and ad-
vertising, the American Cancer
Society has been able toreach
thousands of people who now
know how to help save lives from
cancer through the various forms
of prevention and early detection.

Train lost for a candy bar

By Carolyn Lumsden

Associated Press Writer

GARDNER, Mass. —— The
careening journey of a runaway
train that had to be stopped by
slamming it into empty railroad
cars began when its engineer left
it idling to run into a store to buy
candy, police said Wednesday.

The engineer, the sole oc-
cupant of the train, and a police-
man who answered his frantic
call for help chased the train
through three towns Monday, try-
ing in vain to head it off at cross-
ings before giving up.

A railroad official said he was
convinced that striking workers
sent the train on its journey.

The train traveled about 30
miles at speeds up to 55 mph
through rural western Mas-
sachusetts, going through at least
nine crossings be_fore it was
slowed by a hill and deliberately

failure of individuals to observe
the law.” 2

Much of the report is a recita-
tion of informati'ori' that‘ became
familiar to Americans through a
summer of televised hearings:
How the administration, worried
about the fate of Americans held
hostage in Lebanon, violated its
own policies by selling weapons .
to Iran; how it sought private and
foreign money to sustain the Con-
tras after Congress jerked away
federal funds, and how the two
undertakings came together un-
der North and National Security
Adviser John M. Poindexter.

The report describes formation
of what came to be calledi/‘the
enterprise,” a private covert ac-
tion operation with its own air-
planes, pilots, airfield, ship, secret
communications network and
secret bank accounts.

From its efforts _— channeling

. arms to Iran and‘ to the Contras,

and soliciting contributions —' the
enterprise took in some $48 mil-
lion, the committees concluded.

About $16.5 million went to
support the Contras or to pay for
weapons later sold to the rebels;
$15.2 million was spent on oper-
ations involving Iran; $6.6 mil-

”|t’s ridiculous,” said Jen Beck,
a freshman. ”The ‘power seems to
keep going off only in the girls’
dorms.”

Amy Pajer, a sophomore,
agreed. ”It's a major incon-
venience. It's very hard to get
anything done in the hallway
[where there is emergency light-
ing] with everyone else.” —

Schott said he believes the sys-
tem is ”not unsafe” but will‘oper-
ate more efficiently if residents in
the dorms are more conscious of
the electricity they are using. ,

crashed into a line of empty
freight cars in Deerfield.

Police along the route sped to
crossings to keep cars and people
off the track, ”but there was no
way they could know where the
trai.n was and when it went by,”
said Deerfield Officer John
Newton.

Officials of Guilford Transpor-
tation Co., which operates the
railroad, followed the train from
a control room at company head-
quarters 40 miles.away in Bi||eri-
ca and threw switches by remote
control to divert the train into the
freight cars.

”|t’s certainly not a situation for
which there is a manual," said
Colin Pease, a railroad spokes-
man and vice president who
called the scene in the control
room the ”most harrowing 45
minutes of mylife.”

No one was injured, and
minimal damage was done to the

cars, which were designed to car-
ry prefabricated concrete railroad
ties and to withstand tremendous
shocks, said Pease. ,

The incident came on the fifth
day of a strike by railroad wor-
kers, who walked out over al-
legedly unsafe working

conditions.

Asked Wednesday if he sus-

pected pickets had a hand in the ‘

runaway, Pease replied: ”No, I'm
convinced of it. That train could.
not have moved without some-
body doing something to it.”
He said engineer Donald Silk,
a veteran supervisor, had set the
brakes before leaving the. train..’
State police dusted the engines
for fingerprints, and three FBI
agents were on the scene, said
Pease, who declined further
comment. ‘
A spokesman for the Federal.
Railway Administration said the
engineer violated no rules. ' I

Transplantpatient’s life documented in book-}

donors, especially a beautiful A.
young girl who gave the giftof life  I. 

By Marcia Dunn
Associated Press Writer

An attempt to chronicle her
son's liver transplant and ’’close
the book” on a painful chapter of
her life has resulted in literary
success for Parichehr Yomtoob.

More importantly, it has laid
open the traumatic side of trans-
plantation for scores of patients
and their families and freed many
of them from the often over-
whelming sense of futility and
fear.

”People tell me, ‘Thank you for
writing this book.’ It gives them
hope," Ms. Yomtoob said.
”That’s my reward, when people
like it and enjoy it.”

The Gift of Life, a 222-page ac-
count of the ”medical miracle”

that saved David Yomtoob three ’

weeks before-his 13th birthday in
1981 , is one of only a handful of
books written from the perspec-
tive of a transplant patient’s
family.

Written by Ms. Yomtoob and
author Ted Schwarz, The Gift of
Life -was released by St. Martin's
Press last October. Nearly all of
the 5,000 copies are gone, and a
second printing is planned.

”lt’s really great having some-
thing like that to fall back on and
read about," said Brian Reames,
president‘ of the Transplant
Recipients International Organi-
zation.

Reames, 42, of Greenville, Pa.,
is awaiting a second heart
transplant.

”Once you're told you need a
transplant, it's quite a lonely ex-
perience,” he said. ”Then you

-V find out the_things you're going

through are not uncommon.”

”|t's an important book,” said
University of Pittsburgh trans-
plant pioneer Dr. Thomas E.
Starzl, who performed David's
operation. ”Everyone’s writing a
book these days, but that was a
book from the heart.”

The Boy Scouts of America ap-
parently agreed. The organization
plans to stock the library at its na-
tional headquarters in Irving,
Texas, with The Gift of Life and
offer it by catalog to Scouts con-

ducting organ-donor awareness’

campaigns for public service
badges or certificates.

Perhaps more than anyone,
Ms. Yomtoob, a 45-year-old
homemaker from Albion, Mich.,
is amazed by it all.

”The whole thing is a miracle.
David is so vibrant, and me pub-
lishing a book, that's another
miracle,” she said, laughing.

Her biggest fan, however, has
yet to read the book. He can't.

’’I lived it, so it brings back a
lot of bad memories,” said David
Yomtoob, now 19 and a fresh-
man at the University of Michi-
gan. ’’I break down and start
crying when I start reading parts.”

The Yomtoobs' nightmare be-
gan in the spring of 1981 when
David was diagnosed as having
Wilson's disease, a fatal, heredi-
tary illness in which the body
cannot properly eliminate cop-
per, and it builds up in the brain
and other organs. Ms. Yomtoob
and her husband Joe, 48, a pub-
lic school administrator, were
told a liver transplant was their
middle child's only hope.

’’I thought, ‘Well, if that's go-
ing to save his life and he was
ready to go.’ He was not afraid,”
Ms. Yomtoob recalled.

Three weeks after being admit-V

ted in August, 1981, to Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh, David
went_ into a coma. Soon after-
ward, the family was told a donor
liver had been found, but the
transplant was called off at the
last minute because the organ
was too small. Another liver was
located but was infected. ‘

Finally, on Sept. 26, 1981, the
parents of a brain-dead 15-year-
old girl donated her liver, and
"David was chosen as the
recipient. He became the eighth
youngster to undergo a liver
transplant at Children's Hospital
and eventually recovered.

It was-during the following fall
that Ms. Yomtoob decided to
record her son's harrowing ex-

perience for family and friends.
”Here I was a year later, every-

thing was supposed to get back
to normal,” she said. ”But I
couldn't forget. When September
came, I was back in Pittsburgh
waiting for a liver. I just,couIdn’t
get it out of my head. I thought
by writing it, hopefully, I'd be
able to close the book.”
Although she did not keep
notes during David's illness, Ms.
Yomtoob had no trouble remem-
bering. For eight months, she re-
lived her son's struggle to survive,
writing at least one day a week.

‘Ms. Yomtoob took her
100-page manuscript to Pitts-

burgh in 1983 for a reunion of -

young transplant patients. She
gave copies to doctors, and their
responses were immediate.

”They said, ’We always. treat - 9

these patients, but you never
know what's going through their
minds. You opened.the door for
us,”’ she said.

As a result of the reunion,

Schwarz contacted Ms. Yomtoob,

from numerous families whose

THE PITT NEWS

These filmmakers know how to use their noodle

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

If you thought Alex Cox's

G" , Straight to Hell was the ultimate

spoof on westerns, make an effort

"to see Tampopo by Japanese

director Juzo ltami.

Without denying Cox's cre-
ativity in his Spanish—filmed
production in which the Irish
rock band, The Pogues, play a

S‘ ; gang of desperados addicted to

coffee drinking, ltami’s film, la-
beled as ”the first Japanese noo-
dle western,” is hilarious.
Tampopois the modern tale of
a truck driver (Tsutomo
Yamazaki) who stops for dinner
at a small noodle restaurant and

- decides to hang around to help

the young widow (Nobuko
Miyamoto), who is struggling to
keep her place open.

Rather than seeking justice, the
truck driver, who appropriately
wears a cowboy hat, aids Tampo-
po (the widow) in a frantic city-
wide restaurant taste test for the
perfect soup recipe.

Director ltami is a gourmet
cook himself, and he spends
much time filming the prepara-
tion of noodles, soup, rice and
other dishes. He doesn't omit the
obvious pleasure of food.

The film is packed with scenes

of people dining at home and in‘

restaurants. A young fellow learns
the proper way to consume soup
as his teacher tells him to gaze at

 ---..the bowl for a few moments be-

fore tasting it.

We also meet a young couple
who prefer to entertain them-
selves by putting the food on
each other’s bodies — get the

‘—o‘/\\-IQ./1 ’\z.

- »_\o.‘ \,u'_~ _
‘ ’ -"/,\-4.‘/v\1Q/\\ "/.\_l.‘/I\

picture?
An old woman is a ”fruIt man-
gler.” In a grocery store, she

pokes and squishes a peach un- .

til it bursts, sending the manager
into a frenzy.

These characters cut into the
main story quite sporadically.
The director uses a black circle,
narrowing and widening on the
screen to introduce each se-
quence. It's a technique that
works well; the viewer is given a
”glimpse” into the characters’
lifestyles, table manners in-
cluded.

Tampopo is quite different
from other Japanese films that
have hit America. This is a come-
dy, while others have been dra-
mas. For instance, Ozu’s Tokyo
Story, although much older, is the
slow—paced story of a father and
mother who lose their children to
the attractions of the big city. The
movie plays on the Japanese tal-
ent to turn an ordinary ex-
perience into something vivid
and moving.

ltami presents a different view
of Japan that's far from the stereo-
typical exotic gardens and pago-
das. The film is shot in a large city
where everything is in haste:
trains speeding by, people hurry-
ing and businessmen and crooks
swindling deals. It's a modern lo-

cation for a movie about modern , I

Japanese men and women.

The search for the perfect noo-
dle may be an odd or a flimsy
storyline, but the humor and
weird characters! in this spoof on
westerns make Tampopo a hit.

Tampopo, presented by Film-
makers at the Fulton, continues
through Thanksgiving. Call
471-9700 for screening times.

It was like Jimi Hendrix opening for
the Monkees (that really happened) only
in reverse! Due to vehicular problems,
the scheduled opening band, Opal,
couldn't make it to the Jesus and Mary
Chain show at Graffiti on Monday night.
So, as a last minute replacement,
Dicesare—Eng|er called in locals, 11th
Hour.

It was a truly strange combination.
Borrowing an observation from a friend,
11th Hour sounded like R.E.M.-meets-
Mr. Mister. That's not necessarily a hor-
rible thing, but the onyx-coiffed crowd
did not seem impressed with the first half
of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s set. Re-
cently, their drummer quit —— and J&MC
have been forced to play along with
prerecorded drum tracks. Blah! ‘

It wasn't until ”Kill Surf City” that
J&MC truly began to jam. They even
played longer than their usual 20
minutes!  On the other end of Oakland
were the Cars and their guests from Aus-

tralia, lcehouse. The Cars were, unfor-
tunately, predictably formulaic.

The songs were reproduced, note for
note, exactly as they appeared on the al-
bums. The Cars’ time has come and
gone. lcehouse, on the other hand, has
gone underrated in the States for years.
Their performance had lots of feeling,
and the band was very charismatic. Lead
singer lva Davies caused much swoon-
ing among the women-folk  Speaking
of women, To Damascus wailed to a full
house at the Squirrel Hill American
Legion Hall on Saturday night.

Led by guitarist/lead vocalist Sylvia
Juncosa, this West—Coast trio was sorta
like a cross between Salem 66 and Ted
Nugent. Two local bands opened. The
Crowflies started the show with their
crazed-guitars—from—hel| sound. Are you
still stupid or have you seen them? The
Little Wretches were once again masters
of their VU—influenced material  Way
back on Friday, the Electric Banana was
host to Six Gun Jury and Thick as
Thieves. SGJ was tight and fresh-
sounding.

They seemed to really enjoy playing.
It has been unanimously decided,
.however,~that their lead singer looks like
he stepped off the set of Mr. Roger's
Neighborhood. Bag the cardigan, babe.
Thick as Thieves, on the other hand,
looked fabulous! Their lead singer is a

dead—ringer (no pun intended) for Brian
Jones. But I never saw such a disinterest-
ed performance. A

The lead guitarist and bass player were

having way more fun chewing their gum

than playing their instruments  Records_

you should buy with your lunch money:
Get Lost (Don't Lie!), the debut album
from These Immortal Souls on SST
Records. Low—key intensity from Roland
S. Howard and company. Howard, you
may remember, is the guitarist that
helped The Birthday Party soar to Top

10 status. Galaxy 500 (Capitol) is the

third LP from Fetchin’ Bones.

Another Don Dixon production, this
record is filled with slow songs that really
grind, fast songs that really rock and a
broad who sings them all like there's no
tomorrow. Surely, Fetchin’ Bones is
Charlotte, North Carolina's finest export.

Also, a . Geffen compilation album
named after a club called Scream, where
the bands evolved. It features outstand-
ing performances by T.S.O.L., Jane's Ad-
diction and more. Some of L.A.’s best 
Records to hear and then maybe ask for
at Christmas: Tore Up (Wrestler), the
latest from Austin natives, The Tailga-
tors. Buster Poindexter (RCA) from
Buster and his Banshees of Blue.

You may have seen them as the house
band on Saturday Night Live last season.

Squeeze appears at the Syria Mosque this Monday for a concert co-sponsored
and Dicesare Engler. The concert is being promoted by WXXP.

by Pitt, CMU

  
 

Fans will squeeze into

Mosque for concert  

By William Young

Contributing Editor

Next Monday, Squeeze will be
in concert in the already sold—out
Syria Mosque, supporting their
newest album Babylon And On,
one that songwriter Glenn Til-
brook feels is their best ever.

.Squeeze’s history began in
1975 when they formed in Eng-
land and released a three-song EP
on an idependent label. This led
to a contract with A&M, and
Babylon And On is the eighth al-
bum released by the group.

”lt’s probably the first album
we've made in years that actual-
ly represents what we sound
like,” Tilbrook said. ”We’ve been
waylaid, through our own faults,
by the technique of making
records, and it's gotten the better
of us in recent years. That's not
the case this time. I think we're

all regarding this as our best LP 

ever.”
On Babylon, lyricist Ch_ris

Difford tried to keep the songs f ,
simple to avoid the problems that ‘ ”

they had with Cosi Fan Tutti
Frutti. ’

For Babylon And On, he wrote
from nine to five every day,

secluded in a country cottage, -' 

almost like a regular job.

”My ambition was to keep
things as uncomplicated as pos-
sible,” Difford said. 4

Tilbrook agreed with him, say—’ -" ll

ing, ”l thought I could write ‘sim-

pler songs that wouldn't take so

long to learn how to play/’.
This latest album, represents

the sound that Squeeze likeslto ‘
produce. Everything was kept to ,
a bare minimum. From produc-,

tion and writing to arranging,

Squeeze adhered to the concept"

of simplicity.

A clean, well—lighted
place to smoke, please

The American Cancer Society is holding its annual Great
American Smokeout today. The purpose of the event is to en-
courage smokers, in a positive way, to break the nicotine habit.

When viewing the statistics, one cannot deny that cigarette
smoking is a major contributing factor to many forms of cancer
and other afflictions. The forum provided by the American
Cancer Society to end habitual smoking has always been a posi-
tive, non-threatening one.

However, the issue of smokers’ rights has increasingly be-
come a hot topic of debate, concerning where and when they
have the right to light up. Offices have instituted policies against
smoking and have even instituted penalties for workers disco-
veredsmoking in non-designated smoking areas.

Recently, the University of Pittsburgh implemeted a non-
smoking policy, stating that smoking will now be ‘limited in
public areas. . A .

In doing this, the university is only following acceptable
trends. But where will the line be drawn when personal free-
dom is involved? That is what remains in question.

It is our hope that if the butt stops here, there will be some-
where where those who smoke can do so.

Findingthe Wright
course of action

House Speaker Jim Wright has seemingly come to some ac-
cord with the president and the secretary of state regarding his
assumed role in the Nicaraguan peace negotiations.

Tuesday, George Shultz and Wright signed a six-point agree-
ment to alleviate the problems Wright's discussions with
Nicaraguan leaders have caused. In a New York Times News
Service report, the two were said to have pledged to eliminate
”unnecessary problems” arising from the conflict.

In the agreement, there was little discussion of the actual roles
the two will play in the negotiations. Included in the points
of agreement were: "

0 That the agreement signed by the Central American lead-
ers be allowed every chance to succeed in bringing "peace and
democracy to Central America.” V

0 Negotiations should be guided by Central Americans and
should be held in Central America.

0 The United States has a vital interest in the outcome of the
Central American peace plan. -

0 The United States will meet with the Sandinistas when
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo’s efforts have led to ”serious
negotiations.”

In light of all this, one thing has become clear — that the
United States does indeed want peace in Central America.
Which, in light of the administration's recent efforts to supply
the Contras with arms at any cost, is refreshing.

One troubling aspect of the agreement, though, is the state-
ment that the United States has a '’vital interest” in the out-
come of the peace negotiations. We are forced to wonder
whether the administration's interest is based on a genuine con-

- cern for the welfare of the Nicaraguan people or rather on the

strategic importance of the country.

Reagan's continued insistance that guns and ammunition are
necessary ingredients for peace in Central America does: little
to dispel these doubts. . . s _ . . .. .

Hello.

It's going to snow tomorrow,
yahoo!

Are you in the mood for,some-
thing delightfully different? Tired
of the» Top 40 blasting bars in
Oakland?" Weep no more be-
cause Gary Vincent is playing at
Denny's tonight, Saturday and
next Wednesday. Catch a rising
star and go see him. Denny's is

on Louisa Street, and the shows I

start at 10 p.m. _on all three
nights. Welcome back to Pitts-
burgh, Gary, we've missed you
immensely.

Three-year-old Tabatha Foster,
the girl who had the multiple or-
gan transplants two weeks ago at
Children's Hospital, was walking
around and asking for pizza on
Tuesday. That is a miracle, and
I extend a warm welcome to her
as a member of The Naked City.
If I had my gold stars, she'd get
at least 50.

Last week, "Oreo in May” sug-
gested that we make up ”Naked
City” buttons. Well, rumor hastit
that we can be-expecting them at
any time. Get ready to wear them
with pride.

Thanksgiving is in a week.
Please don't spend it alone. If you
can't make it home to be with fa-
mily and find yourself stuck here,
do what my friends and I are do-
ing. We're having a "Dinner for
the Disenfranchised,” which
means five friends and I who
have no where to go on Thanks-
giving are getting together and
making dinner. You know what?
We're gonna have the time of our
lives.

I received two nifty poems by
a woman who calls herself Diane
Mills. Here they are:

I like it, I like it. I tried to break

to be broken, Ms. Mills, but had
to mess up one. I hope it didn't
confuse your poem’s intention,
and thank you for sharing.

Sooners and ’Huskers go in search of No. 1

By Vince Longo

Staff Writer

No one is calling it the game of
the decade, but the 1987 version I

of the Oklahoma-Nebraska rival-.
ry is probably the most anticipat-
ed game of the year. With each
passing week, it seemed that the
big story was not that Oklahoma
hadwon again, and looked awe-
some in doing so, but that the
Sooners had moved one step
closer to their big Nov. 21 show-
down with Nebraska. Ditto for
the Cornhuskers. A
While all signs seem to be
pointing to certain victory for
Nebraska, the game is still a toss-
up. The Cornhuskers have played

a tougher schedule, and they
have replaced Oklahoma as the
No. 1 team in the nation. Okla-
homa has lost Jamelle Holieway
and Lydell Carr, and the game is
in Lincoln.

Last week — 11-3 (.786)

For the year — 92-36 (.719)

Nebraska-21 Oklahoma-14

On football Saturdays, Nebras-
ka's Memorial Stadium becomes
the third most populous place in
the state. The Huskers have sold
out more consecutive games than
any team in college football.

Notre Dame-23 Penn State-21

Penn State is headed for the
newly prestigious Citrus Bowl,
despite this loss to Notre Dame
and their resultant 7-4 record.

Panthers and the

Golden Flashes:  
No record, but
the same old song

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

What great revelation, what in-
sightful comparisons, what even

partially interesting commentary

can one make when a powerful,
independent football team, say
for instance, the University of
Pittsburgh — sporting its tidy
brand-new Bluebonnet chapeau

— takes on, say for instance, a.

Kent State, a team out of the an-
nual California Bowl—contribuing
Mid-American Conference but
not quite good enough to be
headed to the West Coast in
1987?

The Panthers and the Golden
Flashes both have 7-3 records?
Too simple. Umm (cough
cough), Kent State toppled
Western Michigan this season,
the program that used to be run
by Pitt Assistant Head Coach Jack
Harbaugh? Old news. Errr, this
game was supposed to be vs. the
rough—n—ready Miami Hurricanes,
but in order to avoid a potential-
ly hazardous-to—your-bowl-bid
confrontation with Jimmy John-
son’s powerhouse, Pitt's athletic
department simply voided the
trip to the Orange Bowl and
picked up the pop—n—fresh
Flashies? When college football
puts on its three-piece business
suit, well, that's pretty much the

extent of this showdown.

But seriously, if that's rational-
ly possible, the Kent State football
team is the order of business
here. And Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried refuses to brush them
aside in anticipation of the Blue-
bonnet Bowl. ”I remember last
season, one of the biggest upsets
of the year. LSU was coming off
a big win over Texas A&M, and
Miami of Ohio out of that [Mid-

‘American] conference went’

down to their [LSU’s] home stadi-
um and shut them out —— some-
thing like 12-0. Then Kent State
turned around and beat Miami [of
Ohio].

”They play good football [in

‘the Mid-American]. I'm from

Ohio, and I know the conference
well. It's a solid league, and I
have a great deal of respect for
those_teams,” Gottfried stressed.

”As for Kent State, any team
that's 7-3 is a good football
team.”

True enough. If Kent State was
ever going to upset the Panthers
in 1987, it would ideally be at
this end-of-the-season moment

‘ (with the team coming off a big‘

win over Penn State and a New
Year's Eve showdown with an
SWC-er a month in the waiting).
Or, lest we forget, on the same
October weekend Temple did.

Please see Pitt, page 13

ANALYSIS

Winning two national champion-
ships in the 19805 and havingjoe
Paterno as coach tends to make
the Bowls love those Lions.

Stanford-3.1 California-27

Probably the second-best rival-
ry in the Pac-10, after USC vs.
UCLA. Cal upset Arizona State
last week 38-20, while Stanford
blasted Oregon State 38-7.

Upset of the~Week

USC-24 _UCLA-20

The Rose Bowl people are root-

9 ing for 9-1 UCLA, but it's the 7-3

Trojans who will face Michigan
State in the Granddaddy of Them

All.

South Carolina-20 Clemson-13

The Gamecocks’ 74,000 fans
sometimes get so riled up that the
upper deck of the stadium begins
to sway. Said South Carolina
coach Joe ‘Morrison, ”If it ain't
swayin’, we ain't playin’.” This is
without a doubt one of the
South's best rivalries.

Syracuse-17 West Virginia-16

The Orangemen are playing for
the Sugar Bowl. The ’Eers are
playing for a bowl. Any bowl will
do. The All-America Bowl would
be just fine.

Air Force-29 Hawaii-20

The last home game of the sea-
son is really big at Hawaii. Too
bad this-game is only the third-

to-last home game. What do they _

know about football, anyway?
Texas-14 Baylor-10

Amazingly, the 5-4 Longhorns V

could lose this game and still
make it to the Cotton Bowl, with
a record of 6-5, by beating Texas
A&M in their finale. Wouldn't the
Cotton Bowl people be thrilled
by that?
Iowa-35 Minnesota-13
Next to Michigan State, Iowa is
the hottest team in the Big 10.
This win is their fifth in a row,
and it raises their record to a solid
9-3. The Gophers fall to 6-5.’

Volleyball team to receive NCAA bid, if...

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers are back on
the prowl, and the rest of the field
in the Big East Volleyball Cham-
pionship (held this weekend at
Providence College) had better
watch out.

After losing two consecutive
matches at the Penn State Invita-
tional last weekend (to Penn State
and Syracuse), the Pitt team was

emotionally drained. Despite a
33-4 record, the Lady Panthers
felt they might be left out of the
NCAA tournament because the
Big East champion is not guaran-
teed a berth in the field. ”After
the two losses, we were «in the
grave, and people were throwing
dirt on us. Early this week, we
received some good news from
the NCAA selection committee.
If we win the Big East,‘ we will be

in the tournament,” said an en-.

thused Pitt coach Shelton Collier.
The attitude of the team went
from one of pessimism to one of
optimism. Despite the fact that
key players such as Louise
O’Shaughnessy, Lisa Stewart,
Nora Mulvihill and Denise
Frawley have practiced very little-
this week due to injuries or ill-
ness, ”The team is very anxious_
and excited. We want our season

to continue..We hope our fresh-_ ,

men and sophomores are fablé.lt_o-

 

help us get through the early
rounds of the Big East.’ That will
allow our hurting players time to
recover. The payoff of winning
the Big East is having a chance to

prove ourselves in the NCAA

tournament,” noted Collier.
For four seniors (O’Shaugh-

nessy, Krista Ziener, Noreen

Coughlin and Stewart), winning

the Big East is essential. ’.’I think: _
it is almost betterto have more‘

be the final Big East tournament

for us, and it will be nice to have

some paybacks, especially Syra-
cuse,” commented O’Shaugh-
nessy, team captain.

A reflective Krista Ziener said,
”Coming off of two losses would:

shake the confidence of a lot of I

teams but not ours; we are confi-
dent of our abilities. Ifeel we are
going to go.in and dominate.’’» An.

The Pitt wrestling team shut out
visiting Waynesburg College,
46-0, last night at a nearly-full
Fitzgerald Field House in the Pan-
thers’ opening match of the
season.

”I think it was a good perfor-
mance,” said Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. ”Without tak-
ing anything away from [Waynes-
burg], the competition wasn't that
tough. Still, this was a good way
to get the first one over with.”

Brian O’Kom started things off
for Pitt at the 1 18-pound division
by controlling most of the match,
and settling for an 11-4 win.

“This was my first real start,”
said O’Kom. ”Last year I was on
the second team, so coming out
I was a little nervous. I was fight-
ing my nerves more than
anything.”

Matt Gerhard pulled off Pitt's
first of five pins of the night by
pressing Bruce Trimbath 3:46
into the match.

”It was tough to get going at
first,” said Gerhard, 'a
126-pounder.

Pitt's Brian Shaffer won at 134,
7-5.

Next up was Pitt's 142-pound
junior All-American Pat Santoro.
He started off slow, but pinned
his man with 46 seconds left in
the match.

 

”I felt nervous at first,” said
Santoro. ”But I got better as the
match progressed.”

Freshman Scott Hovan,
wrestling in his first college
match, pinned Mike Dobbins at
the 4:21 mark. ,

At the 158-pound division,
Mike Rossi sealed the Panther’s
win with a 14-5 decision. At this
point in the match Pitt held a
commanding 28-0 lead.

The Panthers were able to pull
off two more pins in the last four
matches. At the 177-pound divi-
sion, Pitt's only starting senior,
Mike Tongel, pinned his oppo-
‘nentwith 29 seconds gone in the
first round. '

’’I was looking forward to this

I estlerspin Waynesburgin home opener

match,” said Tongel. ”I felt real
good going in. I really didn't
know what to expect, but I did go
in looking for the pin. We have
no real weak spots on this team.
We are going to dominate a lot
of meets this year.”

In the heavyweight division,
Pitt’sIohn Owens pinned his op-
ponent in the last period.

”It took me a while to get go-
ing,” said Owens. ”I was sur-
prised because I feel l’m in great

condition. Yet, it was a good.

match.”

In the other two matches, Bill
Lewis won, 7-0, in the
167-pound division, while Pitt's
Bill Armour and Eric Engle of
Waynesburg, provided the fans

with the most exciting match of
the evening at the 1 77-pound di-
vision.

’’Bill was fighting against their
best wrestler. I think he did a
heck of a job,” said Stottlemyer.
’’It felt good to get this one un-
der our belts and get ready for the
rest of the season.”

Pitt travels to Wright State
University this weekend for the
Ohio Open.

selves on the court.”

A determined Lisa Stewart

remarked, ”Because of our loss to
Syracuse, all the teams in the Big
East are out to get us. We are still
the best in the Big East, and we
will let everyone else in the Big
East know it.”

Jenelle Lantagne, a freshman

from San Diego could play a key '

role for the Lady Panthers in her

‘ first Big East tournament. ’’I’m

really excited going to the Big
East for the first time. It is going
to be fun getting revenge on Syra-
cuse. I am ready to win,” said
Lantagne. From the seniors to the
freshmen, the Lady Panthers ap-
pear ready to win.

Picks

country, definitely in the top five.
Earle Bruce, a class individual
who had the misfortune of fol-
lowing the great Woody Hayes,
is coaching his last game for the
Buckeyes.

Wyoming-28 UTEP-14

Wyoming will win the WAC ti-
tle by beating UTEP this week
and Hawaii next. UTEP’s season
is still a huge success, their record
now standing at 7-3.

Washington-27

Washington State-10

This game has been the best
rivalry that nobody knows about
over the past several years, but
both teams are down this year.
But this is a rivalry," so records
don't matter.

Indiana-30 Purdue-7

Take your pick for the greatest
success‘ story of 1987: Notre
Dame, Syracuse or Indiana. The
Hoosiers are headed for the
respectable Peach Bowl, to be
played on Jan. 2.

Michigan State-38

Wisconsin-3

Michigan State coach George
Perles, a former assistant coach
with the Pittsburgh Steelers, said
that winning four Super Bowls
with the Steelers can't even com-
pare to winning the Big 10. He
said he'll probably give his Super
Bowl rings to his kids and wear
only the Big 10 championship
ring.

Texas A&M-26 TCU.-21

Win or lose this game, the Ag-
gies still have to beat Texas to be
picking Cotton.

Pitt

Continued from page 11

”lt’m looking’ forward to play-
ing Pitt,” remarked Kent State
head coach Glen Mason. ”Last
season, we went down to play a
tough [University of] Florida
team, and they beat us something
like 52-9. But it was a good ex-
perience for us. Our guys played
against 80—some thousand people
for the first time, and they played
hard. I'm sure playing Pitt will be

_a valuable experience for our

ballclub also.”

Well, for one thing, the Gold-
en Flashes won’t be playing in
front of 80-something thousand
this Saturday’ at Pitt Stadium.
Maybe half that. And don't look

for the Panther offense to chalk
up 52 points — it hasn't been
their style since Danny Marino
headed down to Florida.

Now the nine, that's something
different. The Panthers are fourth
in the country in scoring defense,
allowing only 10.9 ppg. ”They
look like the Giants out there,”
remarked one Tucson, Ariz., resi-
dent who watched Pitt’s victory
over Penn State on ESPN. ”Out-
standing defense!” '

Mason's squad has averaged
370 yards and 22 points per
game this season, but he doesn't
reallyrforsee any of those num-
bers rolling up for his Flashes, not

against this version ofthe Pitt
defense. ”They have one of the

best defensive fronts I've seen. A

lot of teams are forced to play a
3-4 defense since they don't have
enough quality, defensive line-
men. Pitt plays a four-man front
with the great linemen they've
got.

”What can I say? It's gonna be
a tough game for us,” Mason ad-
ded. ”We’re not going to a bowl
game, since we didn't win our
conference. We're just going
over [to Pitt] and play the game.”

And those are precisely the
kind of teams to watch out for,
the ones with nothing to lose.

Senior Coughlin
overcomes pain
to lead Panthers

By Don Boyd at a high level for the Lady Pan-
thers. ”Noreen is definitely one
of the unsung heroes of the team.
She is our No. 1 blocker, and we
would not be where we are
(33-4) without her,” said.Pitt 1
Coach Shelton Collier.

Upon graduation from
Shoreham-Wading River High
School on Long Island, Coughlin
decided to continue playing
volleyball whilefurthering her
education at the Air Force Acade-
my. During her freshman year,
Coughlin decided the Air Force
was not for her. Looking to trans-,
fer, it was suggested to Coughlin
by her coach at Air Force (Bill
Peer) that she Contact Collier at
Pitt. ”After seeing her play and ~
getting to know her a bit,‘ we
were very interested in her,”

  

Noreen Coughlin, senior front-
row specialist for the Pitt wom-
en’s'volleyball team, knows what
it is like to overcome adversity.
She has overcome frequent knee’
injuries in her collegiate career.

Coughlin commented on her
troublesome right knee: ’’It has
been dislocated three times. Af-
ter the second dislocation, it was
operated on in hopes of decreas-
ing the probability of another dis-
location. Unfortunately, it blew
out last winter. It has frustrated
me; out of high school, I had aspi-
rations of being a great all-around
player. It has affected me mostly
on defense where quick reactions
are needed.”

' All children ages to 8 can get in step as they
participate in a march led by the ONE AND
BANDS ONLY—PITT PAN'I'I-IER. 1

While injuries have hampered recalled Collier. Coughlin

remembers why she chose Pitt
over Rhode Island: ’’I liked the ur-
ban environment, Pitt's academ-
ic reputation, and I had a better
feeling about the volleyball pro-
gram at Pitt.” ,

Coughlin has excelled in the
classroom as well as on the court,
maintaining a 3.4 QPA in the
business program. She has
earned a nomination for the Aca-
demic All-America team. Cough-
lin’s intelligence shows up on the
court as well. ”She is our most
cognitive player, always thinking

about and preparing for the next
opponent,” commented Collier.

Coughlin has high hopes for
the rest of this season. ”After hav-

~ ing a great winning streak, we

were all very confident, and now
we have to deal with the two
losses last weekend. We are
gradually getting our confidence
back through practice and play-
ing progressively stronger at the
Big East tournament this week.
We hope to be prepared to win
our first—round match in the
NCAA, [tournament],” said
Coughlin. I I
