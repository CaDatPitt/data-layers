Judge
suspends
military ban

Phil Willon and Shelby Grad
Los Angeles Times (MCT Campus)

RIVERSIDE, Calif. — A federal judge in Riv-
erside, Calif., who last month struck down
the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy,
imposed an injunction on Tuesday ordering
federal officials not to enforce the contro-
versial policy on gays in the military.

The federal government has 60 days to
appeal, but Justice Department attorneys
have not said whether they will.

U.S. District Courtjudge Virginia A. Phil-
lips wrote that the defendants, the United
States of America and the Secretary of De-
fense, must immediately “suspend and dis-
continue any investigation, or ‘discharge,
separation or other proceeding, that may
have been commenced under the ‘Don’t Ask,
Don’t Tell’ Act, or pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 654
or its implementing regulations, on or prior
to the date of this Judgmen .”

In September, Phillips said the policy
banning gays did not preserve military read-
iness, contrary to what many supporters
have argued, and that evidence shows that
the policy in fact had a “direct and deleteri-
ous effect” on the military. She also found
that “don’t ask, don’t tell” violated the First
Amendment. '

Phillips said at the time that she would
issue an injunction barring the government
from enforcing the policy.

The case was ﬁled by the Log Cabin Re-

‘ publicans, the largest political organizatio
for gays in the GOP, in 2004. ‘

During the trial, Justice Department at-
torney Paul G. Freeborne argued that Con-
gress — not a federal court — should have

Politicians
visit as
election
nears

Mallory Grossman
Staff Writer

Politicians running in the November midterm
elections and their campaign representatives
lined the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Posvar Hall last night to
take part in a candidates fair.

The Pitt College Democrats and Republi-
cans sponsored the event to give students a
chance to get to know the people running for
office. About 100 students attended the fair
total, with 10 or 20 present at any single time
throughout the evening.

Andy Hamm, campaign coordinatorfor Pitt
College Republicans, said he wanted the fair
to happen-because many of his friends didn’t
know who was running in the election.

“Students need to strive to be better in-
formed,” Hamm said. “The right to vote is out
there and we need to respect it.”

Guests present included candidates and
campaigns for Congress, governor and state
representative with the Democrats, Republi-
cans and the Green Party represented.

Most candidates, regardless of political
ideology, agreed on one idea —- that Pitt stu-
dents should exercise their right to vote.

“So many [people] die ﬁghting for the rigtt
to vote in other countries and people here take
it for granted,” said Melissa Haluszczak, a
Republican running for Congress in the 14th
district, which includes Oakland and most of
the rest of Pittsburgh.

Haluszczak attended the fair so that she
could answer ‘questions that students might
have.

“Every election matters, and students don’t

SGB to reviseconstitution

Marissa Meredyth
S taﬁ" Wri ter

The Student Government Board made
plans to revise its constitution during
last night’s meeting in the bottom of the
William Pitt Union.

The Board approved the creation of a

Constitutional Review Committee to fix -

sections of the ﬁve-page document. Judi-
cial chair Scott Krzywonos said the consti-
tution was “sloppily written” in parts and
that this committee would be responsible
for rewriting certain amendments. He

didn’t mention which amendments would -

   

be revised or when the committee will
finish the revisions. ’

Three SGB members, Krzywonos and
one non-CGS Pitt student will review the
constitution. All revisions to the document
must be approved by the Board before
becoming ofﬁcial.

SGB also ended a three-week debate in
last nights meeting when it allotted the
Society of Women Engineers $1,565.60 to

‘attend a conference. .

The group originally requested $3,986
to send eight members to a four-day con-
ference. They later amended the proposal
to send only four women and chose to
cover part of the remaining cost them-

Board for a second time last night.

“It’s»been a long and grueling process;

Board member Kieran O’Leary felt
strongly about denying the amended re-

Susan Sestak, the wife of Democratic U.S.

“If you don’t vote, your right to complain

Rick Saccone, a Republican running for

are not adequately represented because they

“So much is at stakeiin this election, and
there are two different directions the gov-
ernment can take,” Doyle said. “Either the
Democratic majoritywill stay or Republicans
will take over. This election could signiﬁcantly
change the direction of government.”

He encouraged students to become aware
of the issues, especially those that affect them
directly, such as education and health care
reform.

Sestak was also excited about taking this
opportunity to reach out to students. She
stressed the importance of education and
health care as well, and urged students not
to think that they don’t have to worry about
these issues.

Many students who attended the fair said
they were interested in ﬁnding out about the
issues and the candidates themselves.

Derel Farmer wanted to learn about tuition
reform and other issues that directly affect
students. _

“I want to be able to talk to the candidates
directly and actually get a straight answer out

Other students that attended, such as Eric

actual candidates present and not just their
campaigns.

Google ears remove human error and control

It’s hard to pry yourself away from the '

really great television that’s offered nowa-

. days - like “Jersey Shore.” But with new .
_ cars that drive themselves, an idea Google

is currently testing, you won’t necessarily
have to deprive yourself of that joy.

According to Mashable, Google’s au-
tomated vehicles would allow the driver
to “be productive or entertained in the
vehicle, doing work on a wireless Internet
connection or watching television” instead
of paying attention to the driving task. Yep,
the car would allow you to ﬁst pump with
Snooki and The Situation-while getting
you to where you want to go.

If these artiﬁcial intelligence robot cars
sound a little creepy to you, it’s probably
because they are. Has Google not learned
anything from the extremely conceivable
film, ‘‘I, Robot?” '

Just kidding. We try not to consider Will
Smith movies to be past precedent.

The main purpose of the car is to in-
crease safety by reducing traffic accidents.
Google reports that its cars “use Video
cameras, radar sensors and a laser range
ﬁnder to ‘see’ other traffic, as well as de-
tailed maps to navigate the road ahead.

‘ This is all made possible by Google’s data

centers, which can process the enormous
amounts of information gathered by our

‘ cars when mapping their terrain.”

Although Google has been doing exten-
sive test drives of the vehicles, we have to
wonder if they’ll be approved to sell. Ac-
cording to Mashable, “The most optimistic
projections put this technology at least
eight years away from market.”

In addition, the article notes that all
current trafﬁc laws assume that a human
driver is present in the vehicle.

The only accident that has occurredso

far was when one of the cars was rear-end-'

ed by a driver at a traffic light. Although

this particular accident was the result of
human error and not the fault of the Google
car, we have to wonder if humans will still
be at fault for accidents that might happen
when a computer is operating the car.

If one of the purposes of an automated
car is to allow the driver  well, passen-
ger —— to multitask during transportation,
then we have to assume that the passenger
isn’t paying much attention to passers-by.
The computer is supposed to be able to
react faster anyway, right? Soare acci-
dents then the fault of the passenger or
of Google?

Finally, we feel it’s important to keep in
mind.that whereas humans are deﬁnitely
more than-capable of errorwhile driv-
ing, technology is not currently foolproof.
Computers crash and are hacked all the
time. The problem with this is that, al-
though we feel our lives revolve around
our computers, if something happens to

them, it’s not the end of the world. But if
something happens to the computer that
powers our car, it very well could be the
end of our lives. A crash or a hack could
send us off a bridge.

While an article in The New York Times
states the engineers’ arguments for the

beneﬁts of robot cars, including “robot,

drivers [that] react faster than humans,‘
have 36o—degree perception and do not

get distracted, sleepy or intoxicated,” the

main ﬂaw is that “to be truly safer, the cars

must be far more reliable than, say, today’s

computers, which crash on occasion and

are frequently infected.” _ '

, So while texting and driving without
risk would be a pretty sweet deal, as hu-
mans, we at The Pitt News would like to
maintain at least some sort of control in
our lives by keeping control of our vehicles.
After all, you never know when the robots
will surpass us entirely and turn on us. I

THE MOIJSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Television won’t hold up agail

TV celebrities can’t compete with YouTube favorites

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

One of the great things about technology
is that there is so much of it. No matter
where you look, some kind of invention is
making your life a lot easier than it used to
be. Back before our slap-chopping devices,
chocolate-melting pans and microwave-safe
omelet makers, who knew how to do any of
that? We sure as heck didn’t.

As young, in—the-know college students,

you have beneﬁted from the intellectual lar- ‘

gesse of our top inventors. But sometimes,
two technologies war against each other —
and only one can emerge victorious. Such
‘is the case with the bitter struggle between
television and YouTube.

For many years, the only way you could
see your favorite celebrities was on the tele-
vision. Sure, there were those blockbuster
movies at the theater, but, the economy be-
ing the way it was and is, few people had the
money to get there on a regular basis.

Television had so many nifty ways of
showcasing celebrities. You could watch
established celebrities banter with one an-
other on sitcoms, glamorous celebrities dis-

close their sob stories to Oprah and everyday

celebrities compete withvone another on‘

real life or “reality” contests. If that wasn’t
enough -for you, you could watch news shows
like “Access Hollywood” that recapped the
latest goings-on in the celebrity-verse.
With the advent of the Internet, web
cams and this site called YouTube, the script
ﬂipped. Instead of watching celebrities, you
could videotape yourself doing something
wild and ridiculous and perhaps even be-
come one. Suddenly, those choreographed
falls and drooling little cutie-pie babies on

“America’s Funniest Home Videos” were .

old news.

Users could create any kind of show they
pleased. Did you want to cry about how the
media had mistreated Britney Spears? Flash
your skills as a basso-profundo singer by

performing a song about cocoa—ﬂavored I

precipitation? Demonstrate how you could
uncork a bottle of wine with your shoe? Raise
a ruckus about all of the sexual assaults that
were occurring in your low—income neigh-
borhood? If these happened to be among
your talents, YouTube all but guaranteed
you Internet stardom.

Television has fought back the best that
it could, but its celebrities just. don’t seem
like they can compete. Good old Bachelor

Today’s musicians might have traded their punk gear for tamer clothes, but the genre still exists. For evidence, see the band No Age, pictured above.

Patrick Wagner
V Columnist

I have found proof thatlpunk rock has not
died. While young musicians may have trad-
ed their safety pins and black hair—dye for
more a more mainstream look, their songs
still convey raw emotion. .

V During my freshman year, I discovered
lo-ﬁ while talking about music with a good
friend. Lo-ﬁ is a genre of rock (particularly
punk rock) that emphasizes its own folksi—
ness and simplicity as its main attributes.
The name lo-ﬁ comes from the low ﬁdelity
(less than usual sound quality) that hall-
marks the genre’s recordings.

V Suspicious of anything labeled vaguely in
the same family as the beloved music genre
of my adolescence, I listened with apprehen-
sion when a friend suggested it. He hit the
play buttonon his laptop and something
all too familiar rolledlfrom his speakers,

can appreciate the wonders

although distorted by its journey.

In No Age’s album Nouml heard songs
that I recognized as ﬁtting a pattern in the
celestial cycles of rock ’n’ roll. With raw
electric guitar, emotive vocals and punch-

"you-in—the—teeth drums, it was the truest

edge of punk, adding 30 years of musical
knowledge to the Ramones’ secret formula
with a touch of art-cool that needs a pair of
wayfarers to function. .

‘With this new genre of lo-ﬁ, punk rock
reinvents itself. '

Punk rock’s supposed death is irrelevant
to the kids in their garage who are still ca-
pable of creating powerful music. The group
of artists labeled as lo-ﬁ exposes them as
the next group of angry kids with instru-

.ments who have ended up the darlings of

hipsters and punk rockers alike. A listen
to Wavves’ recent Kirzg of tbe Bearb could
sell the genre’s raw, unpolished sound to
anyone with a taste for audible energy that
of a fuzzbox

and three—chord melodies. lt’s blissful in A

the same way that the country melodies of
the Carter Family are —— tangible feelings
on the pulse of society’s emotion.

This permutation of punk rock is cer-
tainly a little different from the last, but
it’s no more different from its predecessors
than “Batman Begins” was from “Batman
and Robin,” and lo—ﬁ’s predecessors were
some heavy hitters in the history of alter-
native rock. ~ ‘

Twenty years ago, the previous wave
of punk rock began moving its way out of
places like the East Bay in San Francisco,
with groups like NOFX and The Offspring
not only selling platinum records through
traditional media channels but also creating

recordings that stand as some of the best of ~

the ’9os. Rancid’s .._And Out Come z‘/Je U70/vex
should be counted as a masterpiece among
them, with Tim Armstrong’s masterful song-
writing capturing the rays of California and
transporting that sun into the ears of anyone

who picks up the record.

Even before these memorable groups
committed any of their words_ and sounds
to recordings, countless waves of American,
British and world bands slung their instru-
ments’ around their necks and played the
music that came to them even without great
musical knowledge.

That natural inspiration is the foundation
of what makes great music in the ﬁrst place.
With each generation, we see successive
heirs take up the cause of punk rock like a
manifesto to teenage living. No matter your
age, the striking power of punk transcends
time and, whether it’s No Age today, Rancid
in the ’9os or the ’77 originality of Richard
Hell & The Voidoids, it colors the history

of popular music as a distillation of rock’s -

true spirit.

Whether it’s called punk rock or some-
thing completely different, the raw music
of youth is always present and — vitally
— always changing. '

ALBUM REVIEW

Band lacks components

Anna Weldon
Staff Writer

Unknown Component is the quintessen-
tial example of why most one—man bands
never become successful. Keith Lynch, an
Iowa native, takes on the project solo, and
the lacking sound on his upcoming album
T/9e Inﬁnite Def/‘itzitiz/e makes it seem that he
should ﬁnd a few more members.

In 1726 Inﬁnitive Deﬁnitive, released Oct.
12, Lynch tries to make his predictably
dull sound original by adding too much
musical effect. Despite his efforts, the CD
falls short of an exciting tone.

Though a one-man band holds prom-
ise for originality, this album doesn’t de-
liver it. Lynch incorporates a variety of
instruments, which could make for more
developed music, but his collaborations
do not do these instruments any justice.
The dragging guitars and drums paired
with random bits of piano that sound the
same in every song provide little diversity
on the album.

Unknown Component ﬁlls the 10—track
CD with both upbeat and slow songs, but
regardless of the tempo, the music is still
fraught with the same computer— generated

_,_,THROWING A KIRSCHBALL

Football
“season is
not over
yet

 

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

 

Pitt’s nonconference season didn’t go the

way the team or Panther fans hoped. Fans ‘

might have expected one loss, but not three.
Certainly, nobody expected the Panthers to
enter the Big East portion of the schedule
under .500.

Here’s the good news, though: Football

season isn’t over yet. There’s still plenty to

“look forward to and hope for, both from the
Panthers and the rest of the college-football
world. Here’s just a few of things I’m hop-
ing for:

Pitt to win the Big East. Last season,
Panther fans watched as Cincinnati dashed
Pitt’s hopes for a Big East Championship and
a BCS bowl bid on a touchdown pass in the
ﬁnal seconds. Going into this season, nearly
every football expert picked the Panthers to
win the conference and get to the BCS bowl
that they were denied last season. Then, the

{year started, and Pitt stumbled out of the
gate with each game seemingly revealing
new problems. But Pitt can still achieve the
goal of winning a Big East Championship
and that all begins on Saturday when the
Panthers travel to Syracuse to kick off the
conference season.

If Pitt doesn’t win the Big East, WVU
can’t either. If watching the West Virginia
basketball team get to the Final Four last
year proved anything, it was that there are
few things more painful than watching your
school’s biggest rival succeed. So, if Pitt can’t

, _ get back on the right track in time to win the
conference, then I think I speak for all Pan-
ther fans when Isay it would be for the best
if WVU didn’t end up in ﬁrst place either.

Someone new in the National Champi-
onship. We’ve all seen the USCs, Alabamas,
Floridas and Ohio States of the world com-

‘**'pete for a national championship. It’s boring.
It’s predictable. It’s exactly what the BCS is

VOLLEYBALL

Pitt loses heartbreaker to USF

V Ryan Samson I Staff Photographer
Amy Town recorded her fourth double-double of the season this weekend- A

V . . . . . . - : I .

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

A tough loss can have lasting implications
for a team. It might take a long time for
the negative emotions to subside so that
players can move on to face the next op-

I ponent with confidence.

The Pitt volleyball team did not have
that option this weekend.

After a 3-2 loss to Big East rival South
Florida on Saturday, the Panthers (9-12,
4-2 Big East) had less than 24 hours to
refocus and prepare for a match against
another conference opponent, George-
town. -

The Panthers seemed to leave the South
Florida defeat behind them as they secured
a 3-1 victory over the Hoyas, in what head

coach Toby Rens considers a sign of the

team’s growing maturity.

“Losing to USF was heart-breaking,”
Rens said. “It was like losing on a buzz-
er-beater shot in basketball, and such a
loss would be easy to dwell on. I was ex-
tremely pleased with the team’s ability
to turn it around and get a win against
Georgetown.”

South Florida 3, Pitt 2

The Panther’s loss to USF was especially
tough, given last season’s end.

“USF ended-our season last year in
the Big East,” senior middle hitter Imani
Harper said. “We really wanted to destroy
them, so the loss hurt a lot.”

Pitt won the ﬁrst set 28-26 and the third
set 25-23. The Bulls managed to take the
second and fourth sets 25-21 and :28-26,
respectively, before ﬁnishing the victory
with a 16-14 ﬁnal set score.

The “buzzer-beater” comparison comes
from the Panthers’ leads in the ﬁfth set.

Pitt began that set with a 6-1 lead and
again held a ﬁve-point lead with a score
of 12-7, but the Bulls were able to end the
match after a 9-2 run. _

In the match, senior outside hitter Amy
Town, who matched her season-high total
of 22 kills, led Pitt offensively.

While Town’s ability to score points
often garners the most attention, Rens is
quick to point out that her defensive play
is indispensable.

“Most people see the kill ﬁgures that
Amy puts up, which are impressZive,lbut
against USF, she also contributed 13 digs,”
Rens said. “That defensive effort is impor-
tant to generate the offense.”

Town has recorded her fourth double-

designed to produce every season. This year,
I want to see a different team compete for
the title. It would be great if one of those
teams was Boise State or TCU, but Oregon
and Nebraska are also acceptable.

Boise State and TCU to play in a BCS
bowl but not against each other. Last year,
Boise State and TCU competed in the “The
BCS doesn’t want too many teams to be un-
defeated at the end of the year” bowl because
if the two non-BCS schools actually got to
prove themselves against BCS schools, more
people than usual would end up questioning
the system. And there might havepbeen a
repeat of Boise State over Oklahoma — and
that just gave everyone the radical idea that
maybe, just maybe, teams who go unde-
feated should have the same opportunity

to compete for a National Championship '

as other teams that go undefeated.‘Which
brings me to 

BCS system abolished. It won’t happen.
I know it won’t happen. You know it won’t
happen. Everyone knows it’s not going to
happen. But it should. The whole system is
messed up — a combination of computers
and polls that doesn’t allow schools to settle
who the best team is on the ﬁeld. It’s time for
a college football playoff, mainly because if
I hear that a one-loss SEC school deserves
to be in the National Championship over a

undefeated Boise State or TCU one more
time, I’m going to scream. If that’s the way
the system is going to work, just throw all
the schools that are considered good enough
into one giant conference, and let them play
for the title. It’s either that or give everyone
an equal opportunity. S ‘

Denard Robinson to win the Heisman.
Have you seen the quarterback from Michi-
gan play? Enough said.

The Big East to add another football
school or two. Or at least start considering
it. The conference already invited Villanova,
but really, the more the merrier. The Big
East teams this season should wear “Help
Wanted” signs around their necks. Sq

Tino Sunseri to have a big game. I really
want Sunseri to have an impressive game
that ends in a Panther victory, if only to get
Pitt fans to quiet down for two seconds.
Sunseri is a redshirt sophomore starting
for the ﬁrst time; he’s bound to have some
growing pains. But many Pitt fans wanted
Sunseri to play last season, and this year
they expected him to immediately perform
like the second coming of Troy Aikman.
It just wasn’t realistic. So I’ll be patiently

. waiting for Sunseri to put together that big

game that makes Panther fans realize that
maybe all he needed was some support, a
little patience andtime. I

double on the season.

Harper and junior Keisha Leggsalso
earned double—digit kills with 16 and 14,
respectively. I -

Leggs also contributed eight blocks,
although the Panthers were out-blocked
as a team by South Florida 14-10.

“Blocking is such an important part of
our game,” Rens said. “When we execute it
well, it makes a difference in our offensive
efﬁciency.”

Pitt 3, Georgetown 1

With no opportunity to practice be-
tween matches, the Panthers still respond-
ed to the blocking challenge and used the
advantage to defeat Georgetown with set
scores of 25-18, 25-12, 22-25 and 25-20.

“We made necessary adjustments to
our left side blocking, and it really made

a difference against Georgetown,” Harper '

said. «
Harper had eight blocks whereas the
Panthers ﬁnished the match with 14 total

blocks compared to the_ Hoyas’ 10.

“Imani had a difficult defensive assign-
ment,” Rens said. “She met the challenge
well, and her blocks were a major part of
our success.” '

Another aspect of Pitt’s success came
from the offensive balance and distribu-

back to win

tion obtained against Georgetown.

Town and Leggs each recorded 11 kills,
as did senior Rachel Kalberer. Sophomore
Jenn Kaitonachipped in with seven kills
in the.rrfiatch.,;,,;,‘ I

Rensilwas particularly impressed with A 

the play and leadership of Kalberer.

;‘.‘;§jRachel was able to manage multiple
roles,” Rens said. “She had her 11 kills,
but she was also instrumental in com-
municating with the middle blockers and
helping themwith their timing. Having
Racl1el- contribute like that really adds to
the‘§‘eam’s balance.” V A _'

The Panthers will have more time to
prepare for their next match, as they travel
to play an experienced West Virginia team
on Saturday.  A V '

“WVU‘is returning four starters, and
they are coming offiof a win against USF,”
Rens said. “We will focus on offensive ex-
ecution and our transition game in prepa-

ration for WVU’s balanced style of play.”-

For Harper, the next match against the
Mountaineers is a chance to move past a
weekend" of tough competition.

“TheUSF match is behind us, and fo- ,

cusing on it will not help with our future,”
Harper said. “We have plenty ‘of season
left and so much room to grow.” I
