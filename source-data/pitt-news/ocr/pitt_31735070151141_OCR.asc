Guns
banned
from Pitt’s
campus

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

Pitt students won’t be packing heat
any time soon.A December shoot-
ing at an elementary school in New-
town, Conn., that killed 20 students
and six adult employees last month
has brought attention to the debate
over the regulation of ﬁrearms and
concealed carry laws on college
campuses.

According to ﬁgures the National
Conference of State Legislatures
published last year, 49 states allow
concealed carry of a ﬁrearm. Of
these, 21 ban ﬁrearms from cam-
puses outright. Another ﬁve states
allow concealed carry on campuses
by provisions in their concealed-
carry laws. Pennsylvania’s and 22
other states’ laws leave the decision
of whether to ban concealed carry
of ﬁrearms on campus to individual
universities. Pitt chooses to forbid
students and non-students from
carrying weapons .on campus in its
disciplinary codes.

University spokesman John Fe— A

dele explained that those who vio-
lated the policy would be subject to
disciplinary process under the Code
of Conduct. He also said that recent
events have not changed thispolicy.

In order to illustrate the Univer-
sity’s stance on ﬁrearms, Fedele cit-
ed a statement that the Association
of American Universities released
on Jan. 2 in response to the New-
town massacre that was signed by
Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,

20 13 Student Government Board holds ﬁrstmeeting

Boara’ ineiuets committee sic/aairs, announces opening ofPiit Day in Harrisburg registration

Mahita Gaj anan
Staff Writer

The new Student Government
Board members are now ofﬁcially
in office at Pitt, but they have
their sights on the state capital
— and they want students to go
with them.

During its first public meet-
ing, the 2013 Board inaugurated
committee chairpersons, gave
updates on the Board members’
projects and announced the

A opening of registration for Pitt

Day in Harrisburg —-— a yearly
activity supported by SGB dur-
ing which students travel to the
state Capitol building to speak
with lawmakers about state and
University issues.

“It’s a good way to get edu-
cated,” Board President Gordon
Louderback said, referring to the
day of lobbying at the Capitol.
Registration for this year’s event,
to be held on Feb. 12, is currently
open to students online at the

University website and closes on
Feb. 1.

In regard to state funding,
Chancellor Mark N ordenberg will
address the student body regard-
ing state appropriations onjan.
28, Louderback said. He added
that he hoped the address on ap-
propriations would get students
excited to register for Pitt Day
in Harrisburg, at which students
can represent the University and
argue for fair levels of state ap-
propriation.

Louderback also updated the
audience of about 15 attendees
on the progress of his projects.

As part of his campaign ini-
tiatives, Louderback sought
to institute a Fundraising and
Advertising Committee,to help

student groups raise money for
their activities and events, and he
completed that initiative with the
inauguration of the new commit-
tee’s chair, Erin Worbs.

the AAU’s president and nine other univer-
sity chancellors and presidents. Along with
advocating improved care of the mentally
ill and increased accountability on the part
of media for their portrayals of violence, the
statement calls for the tightening of certain
gun—control laws.

“Many high-powered weapons that have
no legitimate use for hunting, marksmanship,
or self-defense continue to be bought and sold,
as are the high—volume magazines often used
by mass murderers,” the statement reads.

But the National Riﬂe Association, which
advocates against such legislation, has claimed
that more citizens carrying ﬁrearms prevents
such mass violence. The NRA released a state-
ment to that effect on Dec. 21, criticizing “gun-
free zones” at schools.

In line with the NRA’s long—held stance,
some states’ laws mandate allowing ﬁrearms
on university campuses.

Sgt. Aaron Chapin, a spokesman for the

University of Wisconsin-Madison Police De-
partment, explained that Wisconsin’s con-
cealed-carry law, which took effect in_No-
vember 2011, explicitly allows for weapons
on university campuses.

But under the law, he said, the university
can still ban weapons inside its buildings as
long as it posts signs to that effect at entrances.

Chapin said that he knew of no gun vio-
lence having taken place on campus since
the law took effect. He could think of one in-
dividual who was reported to the department
because he brought a gun indoors.

Chapin said that though the individual held
a concealed- carry permit, the person received
a citation for trespassing under Wisconsin
state law.

He also explained that UW attempted to
receive an exception from the 2011 concealed-
carry law.

“Our department’s stance and the uni-
versity’s stance is that having a whole lot of
weapons out there doesn’t necessarily prevent
[gun violence],” he said.

But groups that argue for lessening restric-
tions on owning and carrying ﬁrearms say that

legally owned weapons protect innocent lives.
Like the NRA, the advocacy group Stu-
dents for Concealed Carry argues thatﬁrearms

in the right hands enable citizens to defend ,

themselves.

Reid Smith, Students for Concealed Carry’s
director of development, criticized gun-free
zones in ajan. 8 statement he published on
the’organization’s website. In it,- he argued
that violent criminals cannot be expected
to abide bylaws that restrict where they can
carry ﬁrearms.

Smith added that even those who support
gun-free zones admit that “such policies don’t

_keep the ‘bad guys with guns’ out, but they’re
‘still too afraid of the ‘good guys with guns’ to
abolish the zones.”

He went on to call such restrictions, which
he believes only law—abiding citizens would
follow, “ironic.”

Neither the NRA nor Students for Con-
cealed Carry responded to multiple requests
for comment made over the span of several
days.

Some have expressed concerns that armed
citizens, even law—abiding ones, may not pre-

vent mass shootings or minimize the resulting
casualties.
Chief Bob Roberts of the West Virginia

University Police Department said that he i

had read statistics derived from shootouts
involving trained law enforcement oﬂ'lcers',
including FBI agents, that indicated an average
of only three out of every 10 shots the officers
ﬁred hit the intended target.

“That means there’s seven that miss,” he
said.

He believed that such ﬁgures pointed to the
possibility that even legally armed citizens at
the scene of a shooting might increase the risk
of additional casualties among bystanders.

Roberts said that like _Pennsylvan.ia’s laws,
West Virginia’s laws leave the choice of wheth-
er to ban or allow ﬁrearms on private property
up to those who own that property, and WVU
chooses to ban them on its campus.

Roberts also explained that more guns on
the scenes of such “stressﬁil situations” pres-
ent another problem for law enforcement.

“When police officers show up at a scene
and there’s ﬁrearms, we don’t know who the
bad guys are,” Roberts said. I

SGB

Another one of Louderback’s goals, the
creation of a system allowing any student
to propose ideas for new campus improve-
ment projects, is also under way. The link
to submit a project is now available on the
SGB’s Facebook page.

“The projects submission project is up
live today,” Louderback said.

The other Board members touched
on the progress of their initiatives, as
well, noting that they had either held or
scheduled meetings to begin accomplish-
ing their goals.

Board member Amelia Brause has meet-
ings scheduled with University adminis-
trators to work on both the expansion of
the Healthy U Campaign at Pitt and her
goal of encouraging more students to take
the Princeton Review Survey.

Board member Michael Nites saidihe
was advancing with his project to move
the request process for allocations from
the Student Activities Fund online.

“I’m going to be doing a lot of the pro-
gramming myself,” Nites said. “ButI could
still use student input.”

Reporting on his initiatives, Board
member David Rosenthal said an attorney
will be coming to campus to discuss rules

involved with off—campus housing, one of

his three projects. According to Rosenthal,
he will also be working closely with Brause
on the Healthy U campaign to implement
a culinary class to teach students how to

cook.

Board member Sarah Winston said her
efforts to move Student Health Services
appointment reservations online were
under way.

“[The reservation system] will hope-
fully be live at the end of the semester,”
Winston said. if

The Board also inducted the 10 new
committee chairpersons after listing their
names and titles. According to Louder-
back, the Board held about 75 interviews
to select the committee chairs.

The committee chairs for 2013 are:

‘Alex Maj chrzak on Allocations Committee,

Aaron Gish on Elections, Robert Beecher
on Governmental Relations, Mona Kazour
on Community Outreach, Joseph Kozak
on Judicial, Mizane Johnson-Bowman
on Environmental, Abigail Zurschmit on
Transportation and Safety, Nuwan Perera
on Academic Affairs and Mahen Senevi-
ratne as Webmaster.

Louderback also officially inaugurated
Board member Sowmya Sanapala, as she
was on a leadership retreat in Israel during
the 2013 Board’s inauguration last week.

Although the new committee chairs
were inducted, the Board members forgot
to officially name the Board’s business
manager and president pro tempore, who
would assume Louderback’s duties should
he become unable to fulfill them.

“Technically we don’t have to have an
inauguration to let them officially start
their role,” Louderback said. “They can

start to do their job before they are in-
ducted.”

“Corbett’s Penn State football
lawsuit unreasonable, irresponsible

Rohith Palli
Columnist

According to Public Policy Polling,
52 percent of voters in Pennsyl-
vania support Gov. Tom Corbett’s
challenge of the NCAA’s sanc-
tions against Penn State. This is
absolutely baffling. Let’s review
the sanctions to explore just how
deplorably unreasonable Corbett’s
suit is.

Corbett explicitly names sever-
al groups he believes are punished
by the NCAA’s sanctions: “the past,
present and future students, cur-
rent and former student-athletes,
small businesses and the citizens
of Pennsylvania.”

Since Corbett proposes that the
$60 million Penn State was ﬁned
remain in the state — to be spent
on child-abuse—prevention pro-
grams -— anyway, it seems that
he believes that past, present and
future students at Penn State are
being harmed by not being able
to watch quite as good a football
team or bowl games. How terrible.

He says that former student-
athletes are being punished by

having their wins vacated, because
of course it must be of critical im-
portance to the lives of student-
athletes 10 years" removed from
college that their wins remain of-
ﬁcial in the NCAA’s books. Current
student-athletes, admittedly, are
being punished by their inability
to participate in the postseason.
However, this seems an accept-
able side effect of the sanctions
the NCAA has applied to reduce the
emphasis on football at Penn State.

Finally, Corbett names small
businesses and the citizens of
Pennsylvania among those whom
he seeks to protect. Presumably,
small businesses would be dam-
aged by the lack of bowl games
and reduced enthusiasm for Penn
State, and the citizens of Pennsyl-
vania would thereby be damaged
economically.

The facts are, however, that
small businesses are unlikely to
be greatly adversely affected. De-
spite the bad publicity, Penn State
has the 26th—best recruiting class
for 2013, according to ESPN, and
enthusiasm for Penn State football
still seems to be running high.

Corbett himself cites the cre-

ation of 2,200 jobs by the foot-
ball program and $5 million in tax
revenue for Pennsylvania, but the
NCAA’s sanctions in no way would
reduce these numbers. Despite the
fact that the football program may
be slightly worse off, it still has fans
and still plays games, so the effects
it has on commerce will remain the
same. So no real economic harm
will be done, other than bars and
restaurants notbeneﬁtingfrom the
viewing of a bowl game.

This, however, should be irrel-
evant. Despite the fact that Penn
State is no longer generating that
revenue for Pennsylvania business-
es on a bowl game day, the money

to be gained doesn’t just go down-

the drain. Since bowl game ‘place-
ment is a.zero—sum game, Penn
State not having a berth means that
someone else does, and small busi-
nesses in that area will receive the
beneﬁts instead, something that
doesn’t seem so terrible, given the
circumstances.

The argument seems to be, “I,
selﬁsh governor of astate that I
want to reelect me, wish to have

all revenues and taxes and money remain
within my state and not beneﬁt the rest of
the nation, and the law is on my side.” This
attitude is further evidenced by the claims on
how to spend the money ﬁned and the fact
that six out of nine negative effects of the
NCAA sanctions listed in his lawsuit result
in “harm to the state revenue base.”

An even more egregious example of this
attitude was the lawsuit by state Sen. Jake
Corman, which aimed to keep all the money
that is already earmarked for children’s non-
proﬁts in Pennsylvania. What happened to,
“united we stand, divided we fall?” These
actions represent a clear effort on the part

of elected state oﬂicials to ensure that their
state has an edge on other states.
Admittedly, eliminating awe for the Penn
State football program and removing mon-
etary incentives from hiding scandal at such a
football program coincidentally also serve to
shift some amount of revenue from Pennsyl-
vania to the rest of the nation. But this shift is
undertaken for the betterment of both Penn

4 State itself and college athletics, in general.

Ultimately, a resentment of this is some-
what understandable, but these lawsuits and
the perspective they engender both lose sight
of what is important and act incredibly un-
wisely.

The NCAA’s goal for these sanctions, in
my own words, is to ensure that officials
remember that football is just a game: some-

thing that Corbett has clearly lost sight of.
Furthermore, despite the NCAA’s notorious
shortcomings, by accusing the organization
of punishing Penn State merely to bolster its
own reputation and beneﬁt other schools,
Corbett is leveling unjustiﬁed, likely untrue
accusations. '

In Point 55 of Corbett’s legal ﬁling, the au-
thor points out that Ohio State seems to have
a similar reverence for the football program
in that the president of the university joked
that the football coach could ﬁre him. This
is a far cry from undermining the NCAA’s
position, and it lends incredible validity to
what they are doing. The message is clear:
over—respecting a football coach can and will
get you in trouble from now on.

The governor of a state such as Pennsyl-

vania should have much more productive ‘
things to do than prop up a football team. It is
my hope that the NCAA and its president pur-
sue slander or defamation charges against
Corbett. This sort of treatment is exactly
what would be deserved for showing such
a profound lack of reason or judiciousness.

Continued public support for Corbett’s
sentimental,'nonsensical lawsuit reveals the
outsize value that our society (or Pennsyl-
vanian society, at least) places upon sports.

The existence of this lawsuit and the fer-
vor with which it is being pursued reveal a
horrifying lack of ethical and practical con-
sideration on the part of both the voters of
Pennsylvania and their elected representa-
tives. I -

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff I/Vriter

The Pitt men’s basketball team (13-4,
1-3 Big East) travels to the Philadel-
phia area Wednesday evening to take
on cross-state rival Villanova (11-5,
2-1 Big East), as the Panthers hope
to return to theirwinning ways after
a disappointing 1-3 start to confer-
ence play. 1

Looking ahead to Wednesday’s
game, Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
explained the key to his team’s suc-
cess will be nothing new or extraor-
dinary — Pitt just needs to‘ rebound
better.

“We’ll need to get back to re-
bound,” Dixon said. “That’s what
I’ve been saying all year, and it’s cost
us those last couple games that we
lost. And in the win against George-
town, we out-rebounded them, so
the numbers don’t lie.”

In addition to Dixon, junior
guard Trey Zeigler also knows the
importance of out-rebounding the
opposition and the success that ac-
complishing such an objective will
likely lead to for the Panthers.

“Obviously, we got beat on the
boards again [against Marquette],”
Zeigler said. “All three games we
lost, we lost on the boards. Coach
has been emphasizing that, and we
deﬁnitely can play better defense.”

Redshirt senior point guard Tray
Woodall should also be back in the
lineup Wednesday night at The Pa-
vilion after suffering a concussion
during a loose-ball scrum Saturday
afternoon against Marquette that

kept him out for the remainder of
the overtime defeat.

“It’s 24 hours, no symptoms.
Then you have some conditioning,
some running in the 24 hours after
that,” Dixon said. “If the doctors feel
that he can play, then he will play.”

“I’m ﬁne,” Woodall responded
when prompted about the status of
his concussion. And when asked if
he would play Wednesday, Woodall
simply gave a “yup.”

Likely starting at the point,
Woodall will have great defensive
responsibility on the perimeter as
Villanova’s offense ﬂows through
its guards.

Woodall said Pitt defenders must
keep their man in front of them if
they hope to defend successfully
against the Wildcats.

“Just contain the dribbler. It’s the
same dribble—drive offense. We just
gotta make sure we keep the ball in
front of us and try to make sure we
attack the glass,” Woodall said.

Additionally, Dixon recognizes
the ability of the Wildcats — who are
coming off a 72-61 loss at Syracuse
- to knock down the 3-point shot
and to play aggressively on defense.

“We know what kind of team
[Villanova is] ,” Dixon said. “We
knowthey shoot the three. They play
in a man-to—man. They’ll be aggres-
sive and try to force turnovers.”

But the Wildcats have struggled
to knock down shots this season.

As a unit, Villanova shoots 33.6
percent from the beyond the arc and
has a below-average tally from the
ﬁeld overall at 40.8 percent. Villa-

the top 25 in December after a few
unexpected losses settled expecta-
tions for the squad.

The Panthers (9-6, 0-2 Big
East) are in search of their ﬁrst reg-

ular-season Big East victory since
Feb. 15, 2011, a 60-57 decision over
Providence at the Petersen Events
Center. Pitt has failed to win on the
road in Big East play since Feb. 5,
2011, when they toppled West Vir-
ginia at the WVU Coliseum.

The Red Storm (8-6, 2-0 Big
East) enter the 7 p.m. contest un-
defeated in conference play after
squeaking by rival Rutgers, 48-44,
in the Big East opener and domi-
nating Seton Hall, a team to which
Pitt lost earlier this season.

Leading St.John’s scorer Shen-
neika Smith, who is tied with Pitt
forward Asia Logan for eighth in

nova’s scoring output this season has
been relatively equally distributed,
with ﬁve of the team’s players aver-
aging eight points per game or more,

and only two players —JayVaughn .

Pinkston (13.3 ppg) and Ryan Arci-
diacono (12.1) — putting up double
ﬁgures on a nightly basis.

To contrast, Pitt ranks No. 9
overall nationally as a result of
shooting the basketball at the 49.9
percent mark. Villanova’s rate ranks
No. 276.

On Pitt’s individual end, the Pan-
thers will need a much—improved
version of the squad’s leading scorer,
Talib Zanna (12.6 ppg), if Pitt as-
pires to gain another road victory in
the Big East. Saturday, the redshirt
junior forward was all but nonexis-
tent, scoring only three points on
1-9 shooting.

And if redshirt junior small
forward Lamar Patterson wants to
score another 22 points, like he did
on Saturday, no doubt Dixonwould
appreciate the scoring boost.

With Woodall returning to the
lineup, the Pitt offense should per-
form at a higher level. As Pitt fans
have seen many a time this season,
a number of Zanna’s baskets come at
the behest of passes from Woodall.
Even Marquette head coach Buzz
Williams himselfadmitted Woodall’s
departure changed a lot of what Pitt
was able to do offensively against the
Golden Eagles. —

But beyond rebounding and
defense, there is another aspect of
the game where the Panthers need
to see a rapid turnaround — free-

the Big East in scoring, leads a
backcourt tandem with Nadirah
McKenith, both of whom average
double ﬁgures for the Red Storm.
Even though St. John’s lacks size
—— it does not have a player taller
than 6-foot-2 in the starting lineup
— its defense has been able to stop
opposing teams consistently and
hold them, on average, to a modest

54.8 points per game — good for v
. sixth in the_Big East.

But the Panthers’ encouraging
ﬁrst-half performance in the loss
to Villanova should help prepare
the young team for the upcoming
challenges the Big East will offer.

Sophomore guard Brianna
Kiesel saw the difference against
Villanova between this year’s Pitt
squad and last year’s, which failed
to win a Big East game.

“Our team chemistry is so much
better,” Kiesel said. “We already

TASS-ER’S TAKE

Lance Armstrong

Donnie Tasser.
b Staﬁ’ Writer

Something tells me thatwhen Lance Armstrong
confessed about usingperformance—enhancing
drugs to Oprah Winfrey on Monday, he Wasn’t
jumping up and down on the couch.

Winfrey conﬁrmed on “CBS This Morning”
the rumor that the seven—time winner of the
most signiﬁcant cycling race in the world -
the Tour de France -4 admitted to taking PEDS

‘ during a long interview set to air Thursday on

the Oprah Winfrey Network. This, once again,
brings PEDs to the forefront of the sporting

world, just aweek after the Major League Base— -
* ball Hall of Fame didn’t elect anybody from

the infamous “Steroid Era” to its prestigious
company. 

For the longest time,-Armstrongwas more
than just an athlete. His story made him a sym—
bol, a superhero even. Diagnosed with testicu-
lar cancer in October 1996, Armstrong was

given a 40 percent chance of survival after the

disease quickly spread to his lungs and brain.
Three years later, he won the ﬁrst of his seven
consecutive Tour de France titles, completing
a comeback story of such epic proportions that
you couldn’t even ﬁnd it in Disney’s “potential
sports movies” vault.

Better yet, he did it in a way that made
Americans appreciate him even more. Arm—

mountain stages —— the most arduous section
of one of the most grueling sporting events on
 — where his blue—blooded American
selfwould beast the inclines past all those tired
Europeans, legs pumping like pistons as his bike
clirribed up and up and up. He was aﬂesh-and-
bloéd machine,c_reatedthrough old—fashioned
,harélwork, perseverance and an unbreakable
will; not, as U.S. Anti—Doping Agency CEO Tra-
vis ?_a;T‘ygart4call_ed him in October, the head of

A “‘th§§nost sophisticated, professionalized and

suctgessﬁil doping program that sport has ever
see1i.”
Armstrong’s victories bolstered the Ameri-

can ego just as much as they boosted his can-

cer-awareness foundation, Livestrong, and its
proﬁts. But this is where it goes wrong for him.
For years, European newspapers — notably
England’s The “Sunday, Times and Frances Le
Mcinde —— were heavily critical of Armstrong
and consistently suggested drug use. Many

Americans shook off these allegations as .

products of European jealousy of American
dominance, and Armstrong took to the courts
to clear his name from the mudslinging. And
this was his mistake.

Armstrong attacked his critics with such vit-
riol that theybecame even more determined to
prove him guilty. Even though the level of doping
inprofessional cycling makes baseball’s “steroid

era” look tame by comparison and Armstrong’s.

primary competitors during his streak of domi-

nance — Germany’s]an Ullrich, Italy’s Marco
Pantani, Spain’s Iban Mayo and Roberto Heras
and Armstrong’s American teammate, Tyler
Hamilton, among many others — have all been
linked to doping, Armstrong’s story put him on
a pedestal with a giant spotlight that only got
brighter with every title won.

Now, as his downward spiral continues —
he has been stripped of his seven titles, been
bannedfrom competitive cycling for life, lost
most of his corporate sponsors and stepped
down as the chairman of his foundation — he
attempted to answer 0prah’s questions “di—
rectly, honestly and candidly.” And he needed to;

E how people view Armstrong’s legacy depends

largely on this interview.

Many Americans, after sticking up for Arm-
strong, feel betrayed and lied to. This great sym—
bol ofblue—collar American hope is the latest
athlete to fall from the public’s good graces and
reveal his true self — less Rocky Balboa and
more Ivan Drago. Many will not forgive him for
his decision to break the rules to reach athletic
excellence.

The most ardent Armstrong supporters will
continue to support the man and his story. There
is nothing wrong with this. What Armstrong
did — with or without drug use — is truly in-
credible. But now, with a majority of Americans
looking down their noses at him (notto mention
the countless French laughing “I told you so”
from across the pond), how will Armstrong

HEN YUN» -—it’s‘ a‘ grand
_ production. Every year we

start fresh. Every detail
matters. Our goal? Not just another
show. We take our craft beyond the .
boundaries of performing arts as
you know it.

A Shen Yun show is a. fusion of
classical arts with modern appeal.
As one audience member put it, “It’s.
like a fashion show, opera, concert,
and dance‘ performance all rolled

into one? Difficult? Yes. Impos- *

sible? No. Our passion motivates us
to bring all these elements ‘together .
into one extraordinary experience?

    

Classical Chinese dance lies at the
. heart of our performances. The
dancersmwith what some have
called “limitless bodies”-—~turn an
intensely‘ difficult art form ‘into
something beautiful and effort-
less. China’s 5,000 years of civili-
zation provide an endless source
of inspiration. The choreographers
work closely with the composers
to recreate ancient stories and
"legends, or convey an aspect of the

culture, through short pieces that
last no more than a few minutes.
Our graphic artists, meanwhile,
use advanced digital technology
to produce stunning animated

backdrops that correspond
precisely to each dance.
After seeing the show, one

‘audience member marveled, “This
production. .. is nothing short of a
miracle.”

 

     

‘‘It’s not just pretty pretty, it’s serious
pretty - there’s a lot of depth to it, and a--- »
lot of meaning."

-- Vanessa Harwood, Ofﬁcer of the Order of Canada. farmer

“I have reviewed over 3,000 shows since
1942...”! will give this production five stars.
That’s the top!  We never seen anything
like that.” “You should go back and see it
about six times.” y
