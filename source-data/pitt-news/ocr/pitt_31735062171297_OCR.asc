Political Tactics Revealed

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Political campaigning and media usage in
campaign strategy were the respective topics fea-
tured at the Saturday morning session of the
Conference on Political Candidates and Cam-
paigns, a program sponsored by the Office for the
Operations in Political Systems (OOPS). a Carne-
gie-Mellon University. Pennsylvania Democrat
Norval Reece. who campaigned unsuccessful-
ly for his party's nomination for the U.S. Senate
last spring. held an informal discussion with few-
er than 20 students.

NEW SITUATION

Speaking of election campaigns their influ-
ence on and by political parties, Mr. Reece not-
ed that “the present situation is different from
that of ten years ago. The electorate of today is
the best educated and informed ever. Whatever

\. apathy exists is informed rather than ignorant.”

...He cautioned, however. that “this doesn't nec-
essarily mean that people will vote for the candi-

date or the issues. This is due to the influence of
television." he stressed.

...Reece explained that people judge a candi-
date by the image he conveys through television.
If they are impressed. they will vote for him.

MACHINES WEAKEN

The politician attributed the weakening of
party machinery to such educational and com-
municational factors. He cited the election of
Mayor Peter F. Flaherty as an indication of the
break-down of party control and the increase of
independent voting patterns.

He also showed how the parties enhance their
power by forming new constituencies. As an ex-
ample. he mentioned the Southern strategy practic-
ed by the Nixon Administration.

“The Republicans are trying to carve a major-
ity from the right-leaning center consisting of
Middle America, Blue-Collar Workers, and Hard
Hats.” He described the methods of Nixon and
Agnew as “calculated public relations which lab-
el every dissenter a ‘radical-liberal’.”

The Democrat asserted that these are the tac-
tics that the Republicans are employing in their
efforts to increase their representation in Con-
gress following the election. The issues they are
exploiting. Reece said. are “radical-liberals. crime.
and disorder. and inflation. both of which they are
blaming on the Democrats."

“The Democrats." admitted Reece. "are stuck
for an issue. They could emphasize inflation and
unemployment. but the Stock Market presently
favors the President.”

The former candidate concluded his talk by
commenting on the direction of political parties.
“They will remain powerful only if we concede
that power to them,” he stated. “We must ring
doorballs and apply personal persuasion wherever

through grassroots campaigning and getting the
foot in the door.”

we possibly can. The best way to be effective is     

MEDIA USE

...George Romero, President of Latent Image
Productions. Discussed the function of media in

.a political campaign. “From television." he ex-

plained. “the public gets an image of the can-
didate running for office. People get a perspec-
tive of his personality. ability to do the job. and

Student Political Support Sought

by ELLIOT GILL

On Saturday afternoon at

- Carnegie-Mellon‘s Skibo Hall.

two programs dealing with the
conduct of political campaigns
were held for the benefit of the
politically-minded college stu-
dent. Of the thousands of such
"interested" students in the
area. a good 15 or 20 A_ show-
ed up to hear a number of in-
dividuals active in Pennsyl-
vania politics.

The first half of the afternoon
program included a talk by Rob-
ert Colonna. a local political con-
sultant who has worked on several
campaigns for Rebpulican candi-
dates.

“I’m very critical of student
involvement in politics,” Colonna
commented. “There are more
sparks than actual political activ-

)ity. The turnout today reflects
' this apathy.”

. Colonna said he believes that it
is not necessary. f_or a candidate

A  to‘,go' along with the views {of his
. .c_ons_ti_tuen_cy in order to win. He‘

pointed out several examples of
this.

"However." he cautioned. "we
.see less and less of this kind of
person who will take a stand and
follow it all the way (despite the
opposition of the voters ) . “

State Representative Gerald
Kaufman, who was also present,
stated that people are trained to
be spectators of, not participants
in, the political process.

“We're all afraid of the respon-
sibility of decision making." he
commented. citing this as the rea-
son for the reluctance of most in-
dividuals to participate actively
in the political system.

Both Colonna and Kaufman
agreed that the state was in seri-
ous financial trouble. Kaufman
said the state will go bankrupt in
March without new taxes. Accord-
ing to Colonna. the reluctance of
either of the two‘ gubernatorial
candidates to come out firmly for
a state income tax is due to the
fact that they both. perceive this
as an extremely ,unpopular.i_sVs_it§;

The second part of the program
was an open discussion. Among
the participants were Assistant
Allegheny County Solicitor Wil-
liam Cercone, Jr., State Repre-
sentative H. Sheldon Parker and
Norval Reece, plitical consultant
and unsuccessful candidate for
the Democratic Senatorial nom-
ination.

The general consensus of these
men was that. due to the weaken-
ed state of both major parties in
Pennsylvania. independent can-
didates with sufficient amounts
of money and campaign workers
have had excellent opportunities
to win primary and general elec-
tions.

They also agreed that student
support can be effective. and in
general. should be sought by most
political candidates. However.
they emphasized that there is
danger of voter backlash if stu-
dents do not follow the correct
procedures of political campaign-
ing. All agreed that students must
work within the framework ‘of the
campaign of the candidate -they

Shapp And Broderick

Debate Income Tax

The state income tax was as-
sured a flat refusal by Lieuten-
ant Governor Raymond Broder-
ick while Milton Shapp stated
that the tax was still a possibil-
ity, if not a necessity, in a de-
bate last week._

by MICHAEL SIMON

Raymond Broderick, Republi-
can gubernatorial candidate, and
the Democratic candidate, Mil-
ton Shapp, met in the Tree of
Life Synagogue, September 22,
at 8 p.m. for a presentation of
party platforms and general ques-
tion and answer period.

Broderick spoke first. present-I
ing his plan of action.

The platform, composed of two
parts, is Broderick’s remedy for
the state’s fiscal problems, and as
he stated, “the ever increasing
acts of violence and crime in
the Commonwealth, which are

more important than the fiscal“

situation.”

Broderick reassured the peo-
ple that he would not sign into
being any type of state personal
income tax, contending that the
present Federal and wage taxes
are sufficient.

..The Republican candidate ad-
vocated a massive reorganization
of Pennsylvania's government.

 

RAYMOND BRODERIK

“Savings of 40-50 million doll-
ars,“ he claimed. "would be
netted if we localized the De-
partment of Motor Vehicles, cut
down our Manpower training cen-
ters and abolished unimportant
ceremonial departments."

Broderick also urged better
tax collection methods, as “ap-
proximately 115 million dollars
could be saved.”

The last two aspects of Brod-
erick’s fiscal program include re-
vamping the states welfare de-
partment and requesting that
the Federal government return
more money on each Pennsyl-
vania tax dollar.

“These reforms would not only
balance our budget. “noted Bro-.
derick. "but funnel more mon-
ey to the educational processes
of the state."

The second phase of the Re-
publican plan included solu-
tions for Pennsylvanias problem
of crime and violence.

The Republican candidate felt
that speedier trials adequate sen-
tencing, better correctional in-
stitutes and equal law enforce-
ment would cure part of the pro-
blem.

“Drug abuse,” Broderick
claimed, “can be solved through
better treatment centers for ad-
dicts, effective punishment for
suppliers of drugs, and better
law enforcement.”

Milton Shapp initiated his pre-

sentation of a platform with a _

comparison of the Penn Central
Railroad’s dilemma and the pre-
sent monetary problems of the
state; both result, he said, from
mismanagement.

“The state,” he continued,
“cannot hide its financial troub-

les by raising taxes; it only illu-.

minates them further.”

“Broderick is misleading the
people,” Shapp slashed. He

years and did nothing; now he
supposedly has all the answers.”

"He said in 1966 that there
would be no increase in the pay-
roll. then went ahead and hired
17.000 more people."

"Brodericks position on the
state income tax is question-

able." Shapp expounded. "as he

recently stated that he was in
favor of such a tax."

Shapp felt that the government
should be put on a “businesslike
basis." as it is obvious that "these
people can't run the $5 billion
state budget.“

Drug abuse was the first prob-
lems posed in the question and
answer period.

Shapp stated that "there are
only 30 narcotics agents in the
Commonwealth. illustrating the
haphazard problem solving meth-
ods of the present administra-
tion."

Broderick countered with the
fact that "these 30 agents are
employed by the Bureau of Pub-
lic Health. and that our police
departments are well trained in
this matter."

Both candidates unanimously
condemned pollution.

CAS Course Surveys

Witlc W01'l(l Of Drugs

by SUE HOENSTINE

"You can take a lot of drugs
and not understand what they‘re
doing to your body. This is the
best way to understand how drugs
work.“

"I wish that they had more
courses like this."

"There is a specialist teaching
each field and it seems worth-
while.”

These are comments from stu-
dents enrolled in CAS 14—Drugs:
Actions and Abuse. Dr. Joseph
Buckley, associate dean of the
School of Pharmacy and instruc-
tor of the course, feels it neces-
sary, “since there is a lot of ex-
aggerated and incorrect informa-
tion concerning drugs.”

Dr. Herbert Barry, Dr. David
Clarke. Dr. Robert Ertel. and Dr.
Harold Smookler. all from the
School of Pharmacy, are assist-
ing Buckley. The professors will
discuss basic principles of ana-
tomy, physiology. biochemistry.
and pharmacology. Dr. Joseph
Sedlin of the Sociology depart-
ment will lecture on the social
perspective of drug use.

Buckley hopes that the course
"will give the liberal arts stu-
dent a basic understanding of the
physiologic action of drugs on
the body." Emphasis will be
placed on drugs that are of in-
terest to students, but a study of
drug abuse is not the main ob-
jective of the course. Facts con-
cerning narcotics. hallucinogen-is.
amphetamines. barbituates, "the
pill." smoking, and alcohol will
be discussed. Buckley stressed
that the course does not intend
“to preach about drugs.“ "We

want the students to make up
their own minds concerning the
use of drugs other than thera-
peautic agents." he said.

By discussing drug use in men-
tal disease, the professors hope
to demonstrate the complex na-
ture of drug action. Why the ef-
fects of drugs differ from per-
son to person, possible alterations
in brain tissue from drugs like
LSD, studies on heroin and mari-
juana, and pboblems resulting
from the use of alcohol are top-
ics that will be included during
lectures on physiology and phar-
macology.

Buckley asserts that "most
societies have taken something
to alter moods. However. it
does appear that at the present
time western society is using
more potent and complicated
drugs than previously.“ The
pharmacy professor feels that
"drugs are an important aspect
of everyday life" and through
CAS 14. he hopes to convey and
"appreciation of what
can do.“

Romero remarked that produc-
tion methods depend on factors of
technicality and delivery. “The
type of photography and film_edit-
ing affect the image that a candi-
date reflects of himself."

Two films were then shown
which incorporated opposite sam-
ples of production, formal and in-
formal. The first one, which was
on the informal side, was of in-
cumbent Alabam Governor Albert
Brewer, a Democrat who was de-
feated last June in his state's bu-
bernatorial primaries. The movie
consisted of candid interviews
show spontaneously.

The second film. a documentary
of Lenore Romney. Republican
candidate for U.S. Senator of
Michigan. was a more slick pro-
duction which required organiza-
tion and direction.

FASC

Expanded Services

Aside from a complaint lodged
by Dr. Steven Rosen of the Politi-
cal Science Department (see page
one), Friday‘s initial Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council (FASC)
meeting dealt with routine Uni-
versity matters.

A federally funded Ethnic Stud-
ies program based at the Univer-
sity was discussed. A faculty sem-
inar headed by Dr. Edward J.
Barnes is in progress.

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, dean of
the FAS, mentioned that consider-
ation should be given to the fact
that the University has finite re-
sources that should not be spread
too thinly. Said- Rosenberg, “We
must also make sure that ade-
quate funds are available for ex-
isting programs.”

Consideration of the Universi-
ty‘s tight financial position ush-
ered in_ a discussion concerning
Hillman Library‘s re.ationship
with the various departmental li-
braries in the University.

A certain amount of duplication
of periodicals has been tolerated
up to this point. Individual depart-

ments have resisted giving up a
periodical so that Hillman could
use the additional resources to
expand rather than to duplicate a
certain collection.

Rosenberg noted that “every-
body agrees in principle but dis-
agrees in detail... . . Nobody is
happy with the situation, includ-
ing the library people.” He ex-
plained that many of the profes-

Did you ever sit back and say “Man do I have
it good" and think for a minute how we really do
have it pretty good here at the University Country
Club.

It’s nice to know that you can take a course
you really hate on a credit no/entry basis. It‘s
even nicer to know that all we have to do is go to
classes. study once in a while, and worry about our-
plans for the weekend. Isn‘t it‘?

If you really think it is so nice. stop reading
here, because I don‘t often bother to take a real
look at the rest of the world.

The real world—what‘s going on out there?
Sure. we all know about ,the ar. and Agnew and
Mrs’. Mitchell. but there is another aspect of the
real——unglamorous—world that we tend to over-
look.

UNTIL OPENED EYES

Many of us here don’t realize that we are part
of a large University right in the middle of a resi-
dential part of the center city. Words like poverty
and ghetto really don't mean much to this campus.
until you open your eyes some day and realize
that it’s all around you.

So. what am I trying to say‘? For those who
don't know and might be interested. there are a
few very upsetting things going on around campus.
The University is currently in'the middle of a mas-
sive expansion program and part of this program
and part of this program is a complex of hillside
dorms. up on Allequippa St.. near the Stadium.

The people who live in this neighborhood are
becoming a little worried about these dorms. First
of all, the dorm construction will take away a play-
ground that their children use everyday for foot-
ball and baseball and other things.

The people up there are also upset because
parking and traffic condistions—which are now ri-
diculous—will become worse once 1.300 students
take up residence in the new dorms. Another prob-
lem they have apprehensions about is what the in-

"Because I cannot do everything. I will not re-
fuse to do the something that I can do.“ Edward
Everett Hale.

A Citizenship Information Center has been
formed to assist students who have not yet lost
their hope. their faith, or their interest.

If you are among them, you can call the Pro-
vost‘s Office (ext. 392) or the Office of Student
Affairs .(ext. 238) to find out
where the Center will be located.
Should neither office hear from
many students. they may con-
clude that Edward Everett Hall
was a rare man. And perhaps they ;
will be right. 

Rationalizations for non—in—
volvement. of course. come easi-
ly enough. One of the more com— -
mon is the contention that the R5555
American political system is not responsive to stu-
dent input.

Pennsylvania students who havegiven up on
the system often point to the McCarthy crusade of
1968 and the Reece campaign of 1970 as evidence
of the futuility of political involvement.

" BUT NOT REECE

One man who doesn‘t share such sentiments is
-Norval Reece himself.

Reece. who managed the McCarthy effort in
Pennsylvania and ran unsuccessfully for the Dem-
ocratic nomination for U.S. Senate earlier this

year. might be expected to be bitter or pessimistic. .

But he is not.

“I am confident that we can work through the
system to make it responsive and get good men
elected." he told 20 students attending a politi-

cal conference sponsored by Carnegie—Mellon Uni-

versity Saturday.

The sparse turnout. however. suggested ei-

ther that students nearly unanimously disagree

with Reece or that the reputation students have

 made: I another, -comment}: «which  ‘  if
_le excuse for ‘ ~

troduction of such a large number of people will
do to the tone of living in their neighborhood.

BUW WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

We don‘t have to be concerned about their prob-
lems though. because they don‘t affect our curri-
culum or our football team or our social lives.
They're little people: no great politicians, no
wealthy industrialists, nobody that can really both-
er the life style to which we have grown so accus-
tomed.

But. this is the real world. It‘s the people in
neighborhoods like this that work and live and
make this country run. and the people like this are
too often on the losing end.

Call me a hopeless idealist. or tell me how I‘m
caught up in’ my little ego trip, and you may be
right. But think for a minute. and remember Col-
umbia a few‘ years ago. The gym, the riots . . . . .

We have become an affluent, middle class
campus, so that probably won‘t happen here. The
University will give in _a little, enough to satisfy
those who care. And then we‘ll forget about the
people on Allequippa St.. or maybe we‘ve forgotten
about them already.

By becoming satisfied with all the good things
we have been given, we lose our social conscious.
It would be nice to see some of the students help
these people a little, even though it probably won't
help us.

MAYBE.

Maybe it would give us a good feeling, or may-

be it would show us that there are some things in
this country that aren’t too big to change.

‘ Some students are currently working with the
Student Community Coalition, suggesting alterna-
tives and trying to work things out so that every-
one will benefit. If you do care. it might be worth-
while to offer your help to this group. It’s a small
effort. but it may help bring back some of the real-
ity that we tend to miss.

fect‘ candidates," he admitted, “but any guy who's
running is bound to have a number of flaws.

RESPECT
Fortunately, some students agree with Reece.

They are less concerned about the purity of their’-

rhetoric than they are about the need ‘to get a
message across. They are not so self-righteous
and dogmatic that they can’t respect people with
different ideas. '

One such students, Eva Jefferson of North-
western University, appeared on the David Frost
Show Friday with three other students and Vice-
President Agnew.

-Her opinions, which were notably subtle and
refined. seemed to reflect both concern and in-
tellectual depth. She remained polite and calm

throughout, winning not onlyprolonged applause t

at one point but probably also the debate.
Agnew, though, didn‘t lose the debate, thanks

' to one of the other students. This student didn‘t

try to reason with the Vice-President, as Eva did.

Instead, he spoke harshly and with considerable, .
contempt. Where Eva had left Agnew looking ob-‘

tuse, the other student allowed him to emerge as a
sober statesman. The students venom and un-
shakable conviction proved counterproductive.

If any of us are to be effective this fall, our wis-
dom will have to outweight our passion. More-
over. we must stop scoffing at political strate-
gists who tell us that how we say something is of-
ten as important as what we say.

Letters To The Editor

    Response:

- Writers Hit

On ‘Marxism’
‘ The Editor. The Pitt News:

I see in the Sept. 21 issue of
the Pitt News that Mr. McDon-
ought objects to Mr. Donatell‘s
claim that the left lives in a dream

(V world. It seems to me that Mr.
Donatelli is correct.

The left can in some sense be
characterized as Marxist. so its
members—the few intelligent
ones, at least—-—can therefore be
said to believe in the theory of
alienation of labor. the labor the-
ory of value. the dialectical inter-
pretation of history, economic de-
terminism, the nnotion of
“species-being," and the inevit-
ability of the communist utopia.

Now I’ve done a little philoso-
phy myself, and I say without
qualification that these concepts
are the stupidest that I have ever
run across in my studies. and that

K 9 they characterize a world which
‘ is quite different from the real
one. i

In other words. Marxists do live
in a dream world. These drams
would be nothing more than silly
were it not for the fact that there
are enough nuts around to take
themseriously and attempt to'put
them into practice. in which case
they become downright pernici-
ouszi the world does not conform
to my dream (says the Marxist).

history proves that most human
suffering has been wrought by
such idealists—_Robespierre.
Marx. Lenin. Hitler. Mussolini.
Ho Chi Minh. etc.

To choose the lesser of evils. I
should rather be governed by an
Aristotle than a Plato. a Machi-
avelli than a Robespierre. a Hob-
bes than a Rousseau. or a Bis-
marck than a Marx any day in the
week.

I see that Mark Cohen is still at
‘it. His column was an excellent
proof of the intellectual degener-
acy of Marxism. The proletariat
isn't getting poorer and poorer.
and there is no such thing as
“capitalist imperialism“ in either
theory or practice (except accord-
ing to the twisted dogma of Marx-
ism). Marxists. knowing all this.
have now been forced back to the
"producer's market“ myth. (Even
Galbraith has bought this one——
and its no accident. I suspect.
that he. too. is now a socialist.)

This myth states that capital-
ism no longer oppresses either its
own workers or those of other na-
tions. so—since it must (by de-
finition) oppress someone some-

how—it now oppresses the con-‘

sumers. Capitalism lives! On body
deoderants. One does not know
whether to laugh or cry.

Pitt News Drama Critic

Ann Corio- most famous and
beautiful of all the great strip-
teaser's opened her show at the
Nixon Theatre last Tuesday by
saying. "Come with me and I'll
take you back to the wonderful
days of Burrr-lesque.“

At that point, the Burlesque
Cuties” ran on stage and for two
solid hours the audience (a
capacity crowd) rolled in their
chairs at some of the zaniest
material ever to grace the grand
old stage of the Nixon Theatre.

Just Like The “Good Old Days”

Burlesque was the birthplace
of many of the great comedi-
ans—Milton Berle. Mickey Roon-
ey, Red Skelton. Jerry Lester.
and many more. In‘ its "prime it

was the only other major form
of entertainment for thousands
of men and women other than
the New York stage.

A box office smash hit since
its opening in New York in
March of 1962. Burlesque play-
ed Manhattan for 31.2 years be-
fore going on continuous tours
around America. It has been
successfully doing so ever since.
and in its course of entertain-
ing thousands of theatre goers".
has made show business his-

. tory.

she states, a "sentimental jour-
ney into the past." Based on her

(Editor's Note: The Univer-
sity in conjunction with more
than 20 community organiza-
tions sponsored the Symposium
on Feminism- last Wednesday
and Thursday. All activities took
place in the S.U. Ballroom, in-
cluding the workshops that fol-
lowed each of the speakers’ ad-
dresses. The two day forum was
an attempt to deal with every
aspect of the movement to fem-
inism, representing all colors
and dimensions of the spectrum.
The Pitt News staff members,
Virginia Joyce, Cindy Morgan,
and Carol Scates handled the
assignment. Following is the
joint report.)

Women’s studies, if handled
in a revolutionary context, can
dislocate the traditional insti-
tutions of marriage and the
present economic structure of
the United States, believed a
pioneer in the filed.

 

“The enemy is not the
individual man, but a
sexist society.”

 

“Women have been educated
to perform roles in this nation”,
Dr. Florence Howe, Professor
of English at Goucher College
mused. “They function as soft
cushions for the males of this
society, ie. wives. and they make
up a vast labor pool for the
corporate structures.”

“Women are educated especi-
ally for submission and stupid-
ity,” Dr. Howe evaluated. “It is
an education of willing slaves.”

Quoting from an extensive sur-
vey that she undertook of pri-
mary and secondary texts, Dr.
Howe felt that women learn sex
roles very early “probably be-
fore 18 months.”

 

The Baltimore instructor -was
convinced that the social condi-
tioning of women in schools
stresses acquiescence, passivity.
dependency, obedience and “love
as an opiate to all problems.“

“Traditional education func-
tions maximally to keep the wo-
man in her place, to .give her
amusement but to never destroy
her predilection for marriage”,
said the speaker.

Although 50 percent of the
student population is female and
half of the non-student female
population is working full—time.

Dr‘: Howe pointed out that
"wherever women work. they are

at the bottom in income, job se-

curity and prestige.“

Despite the "heightened educa-
tional opportunities of women.
she continued, they are never-
theless programmed to become
wives and mothers at the expense
of their education. “It produces
a schizophrenia in the woman
student,” she said.

Dr. Howe’s own “conscious-
ness” was fed by her stint as a
teacher during the “Freedom
Summer” of 1964 in Missis-
sippi.

“In Mississippi, the students
found a new connection between
learning and life and ways to
apply it,” she said. “And that
must be the function of women’s
studies.”

Education as it is known is in-
adequate to deal with the prob-
lem, she evaluated.” “There’s
a danger that the women’s move-
ment could be bought off with
jobs,” she warned. “If profession-
al women obtain jobs, they will
still need a class of women to
take care of their homes and
children. We may change the
proportion of privileged women
while continuing the institution-

alized oppression of the non-
privileged."

Dr. Howe urged that the wo-
men’s movement “out to serve
the interests of all women as a
whole and not just the class in-
terests of University women.”

“It is a national phenomenon.
this women's liberation move-

ment”. she offered. "It cuts
across all lines —— race. class
caste."

“The function of the womens
studies program is to challenge
the basic constructs of our so-
ciety," mused Dr. Howe. “The
connection between the diverse
aspects of the movements and
studies programs may be to turn
each recruit into an organizer
of other women. We need new
constructs for distribution with-
in a sexist society."

Elizabeth Powell, President of
the Welfare Improvement League
of Wilkinsburg, promised a pre-
dominantly white and female
audience last week that if “you
liberate us from the welfare
system, we will turn around and
help you blow this system out
of the sick society that it is in.”

“We don’t get nearly enough
money,” the welfare mother with
five children stated. “The wel-
fare subsidy, for example, only
allows us $17 a month for both
gas and light bills. So we have
to rob Peter to pay Paul, taking

money from the food and the"

clothing funds to pay for gas
and rent."

She further attacked the train-
ing programs which school wel-
fare women are trained to be
nurses’ aides, only to find that
there are no jobs after training
and no day care facilities to ac-
commodate women with child-
ren.

She labelled the food stamp
program inconvenient and “in-
adequate”, pointing out that the
stamps may not be used for

To loosen the tightening job-

market. she suggested that the
ranks of ghetto-based VISTA
volunteers be filled with wel-

_ fare women “since poor people

relate to poor people the best."

‘ It is not liberating to
force a woman into
leaving her home and
family to take on" the
burden of a de-human-
izing job, perhaps the
same, rotten low- pay
job that the husband
has. These men must be
liberated-...t9o.-.”

As far as organized womens
groups are concerned. Mrs.
Powell felt that their immedi-
ate alternative was to “get them-
selves together and march on
something to effect social change.

Charging that the mass media
in the country has not given
women fair and “dignified” cov-
erage, a woman editor predicted
a drastic change for the future.

Angela Schreiber, editor of the
Washington Newsletter for Wo-
men, told a Symposium audi-
ence Thursday at noon that the
“press can no longer ignore the
issue of women’s liberation. The
August 26 Women’s Rights‘
Day and the growth of women's
liberation groups are forcing the
media to take notice of prior
treatment and re—evaluate, be-
lieved Mrs. Schreiber.

Referring to such popular maga-
zines as Playboyand Cosmopoli-
tan the former actress claimed
that “all the media plays on
sex." She suggested that an
economic boycott of the maga-
zines and products that they are
trying to push may be effective.

A survey that she recently

undertook .of 12 major dailies.

across the U.S. revealed that the
singularly most popular issues
concerning women’s achieve-
ments were the Miss‘America

“All papers carry a selection
called ‘For Women’,” she said.
"And they all essentially look
the same — the want ad section,
the fashions. the recipes. soci-
ety news and bridge tips.“

Mrs. Schreiber emphasized
that “there is a place for the
women’s pages and that fashions
are interesting to watch.” But
she felt that newspapers, in
particular, are not “giving wo-
men an equal change and we
aren't complaining.”

Mrs. Schreiber proposed that
women -work to change their
image by “getting involved in
business, politics and govern-
merit." She said that a group of
female federal employees on
Capitol Hill had undertaken a
study on the status of women in
government, and suggested that
women request copies of the
document from their representa-
tives.$a

Stressing that the “enemy is
not the individual man, but a

rate experts from Boston demon-
strated- self-defense techniques

try.

  Symposium Orr 36/m’/«zisrrz

Cagan was the final speaker at
the Symposium on Feminism.
Mrs. Cagan. regional organizer
of the New University Confer-
ence (’NYC) and former editor
of Up from Under, a women‘s
liberation newspaper. addressed
her audience on the topic “Wo-
men's Movement: What is It:
Where is it Goint?"

Mrs. Cagan opened by inform-
ing her primarily female audi-
ence that most women are igno-
rant of their history. She point-
edly referred to the 90-hour.
unpayed work week of the house-
wife, the 10,000 butchered abor-
tions performed in our country
each year. and the fact that
although women comprise 51 to
53 per cent of our country. they
make up only one percent of our
federal legislature.“

Mrs. Cagan said that. “We
women are being screwed by the
system, especially by the adver-
tisers who tell us that our

Studies In
A by DANA VENTGRIGLIA

The display of the works of John.
Rhoden, a contemporary black
sculptor. has brought another
segment of Afro-American cul-
ture to the University commun-
ity_ ..

The exhibit. currently being
shown at the‘Frick Fine Arts
Building. is comprised of 35
pieces in bronze and wood creat-
ed during the past two decades by
the 52 year old artist.

Rhoden has been the recipient
of a vast number of major
awards. most notably the Ful-

   

roles must be those of wives and
mothers. We must define for
ourselves what a woman is and
find our self-identity and pride,
in much the same way as the
blacks are doint in their move-
ment. Since we haven’t been
raised to be competitive, we
are much better organizers than
men. We must change our op-
pression, not just understand it.
Women should organize other
women, open child-care centers,
and even caucus to fight male
comination and chauvinism.”

Mrs. Cagan then broke down
the goals of t-he women's libera-
tion movement into five cate-
gories.

Women must have political
and economic authority. A man
should not automatically be given
all rights over his wife. Women
should have equal jobs for equal

Women must have control over
their own bodies. This means

In the extremely figurative art

abortions should be legalized.
Women should also be able to
control the number of children
that they have. Laws which are
designed against those engaging
in lesbian activities should be
abolished.

The burden of child care must
be taken from women. Centers
which take care of children
both day and night should be
opened and controlled by the
people who use them, not uni-
versities or government agencies.

Every member of our society.
regardless’ of sex or class, should
be given adequate health bene-
fits and education.

The wealth of our country
must be shared with other coun-
tries.$a

Mrs. Cagan added a list of cau-
tions to those attempting to reach
these goals. First, she warned

His enchantment with primitive
folk art is apparentin both the
wood and the metal works, but be-
comes intensified and projected
in his totem-like wooden,sculp—
ture.

. All of these structures are ex-
tremely well-balanced, making
viewing interesting from all an-
gles. The nine foot sculpture, The
Offering, is representative of
Rhoden’s wooden pieces. Its sen-
suous and voluptuous curves ex-
press the author’s preoccupation
with form. The rhythmic empha-
sis is on wholeness.

The accent on round mass in
Rhoden’s wooden works is lost in
his bronze pieces. It is difficult to
believe that the man who sculp-
tured The Offering was the same
man who composed Hippie Par-
ade and The Audience.

tem. Her suggestion was to urge
re-distribution within this sys-
tem until new successful forms
arefound.

Her next area of concern was
legalized abortions. "We must
not allow strilization or the

masses when abortion is legaliz- .

ed," she commented. "and we
must not allow our government
to get out of hand with its use

in Latin America and in our
ghettos."
One of her most important

fears lay in her belief that, “It
is not liberating to force a wo-
man into leaving her home and
children to take on the burden
of a dehumanizing job, perhaps
the same rotten, low-pay job
as the husband has. Thesegmen
must be liberated, too.”

She concluded her remarks
optimistically, saying, "We
have some long,hard days ahead
of us, but I think we are going
to make it."

With Rhoden’s switch of’ma-
terials there seems also be a

shift of themes, especially in his .

most recent works. The bronze
sculptures are much more intri-
cat with the accent on rhythmic
lines and patterns.

Particularly in his contempor-
ary works, notably in the two pre-
viously mentioned, Rhoden has
added polished jeweled glass to
the rough, erect bronze struc-
tures. The inlaid glass adds life
and vibrancy through a textural
difference between the unfinish-
ed surface of bronze and the
smooth melted glass. .

Rhoden’s employment of both

the primitive and topical aspects

of different cultures coupled with
his skill in projecting his ideas
in wood and bronze make this art
exhibit well worth viewing.

After the Pitt football squads
come-from-behind 15-10 victory
over Baylor Saturday night, a lit-
tle girl 'was wandering around
ththe Waco Holiday Inn where
the Panthers were headquarter-
ed. She wanted an autograph of
a Pitt player.

With the assistance of an old-
er sister the shy youngster ask-
ed a gridder who was carrying
a football. She didn't know who
he was, but her selection was a

good one.

The Panther was Phi Sprignoli
and the substitute fullback who

  Panther subscaw1iB21y1or.   13-10

ran three yards for the winning
touchdown in the game. And the
ball was the game ball. which
was awarded to Sprignoli by the
players.

“They gave it to me, and in
honor of the offensive my line,”
Sgrignoli later explained the tri-
bute. “The line was great.”

Viewers wouldn’t have thought
that the Pitt line was anything
beyond average during the first
half of the Pitt-Baylor match.
Other than eht top fullback,
Tony Espostio, the Panther rush-
ers weren’t effective. The Panth-
er game plan was supposed to

be running, but Coach Carl De-
Pasqua relied on John Hogan’s
passing arm for important gains.

The holes were there in’ the
first half," Sgrignoli mentioned.
“I wasn’t in then. but I don‘t
know why we didn't move bet-
ter."

With Esposito’s carrying (11
times for 46 yards) and IIogan’s
nine completions the Panthers
did move the ball somewhat in
the first half. They advanced to
the Baylor eight-yard-line twice,
but never crossed the goal line.

Strong first half running by
Matthew Williams and quarter-
back Laney Cook swept the-Bears
past the Panthers, 7-0. at halftime.
and 10-0 shortly after the third
period kickoff.

In the third quarter a Hogan
pass was intercepted, but more
important was an ankle injury
to Hogan on the play.

Dave Havern, who lost the top
quarterback job to Hogan in
pre-season drills, was given an
opportunity to prove himself.

Havern’s welcome into the
game was a frightful one. He
fumbled the first snap, and was
tackled for short, one-yard gains
on the next two plays. On the

/last one his helmet was ripped

off by a- would—be tackler. Not
a pleasant entrance into the
game for Mr. Havern.

Esposito took charge again,
though. And the other Panth-

Booters Pay For 2-1

By MIKE MILLER

Saturday was a day of firsts for
Coach Leo Bemis and the Pitt
soccer squad. It was the first
time the team played on the new
AstroTurf, but more important, it
was the first victory in the team’s
history over highly-touted West
Chester. A

The team payed for their 2-1
triumph with blood, however,
finishing the match with three
injured players. I

John White, last year’s lead-
ing scorer, was the first casulty,
sustaining an injured ankle in
the second quarter.

White‘ blamed his injury on the
Astro Turf. 7

"I was running and my ankle
just turned," he stated, “I hardly
cut. You can‘t wear spikes out
there. You‘d be better off with
flat shoes.“

Conference “Tsima" Lekoma
was sidelined in the third quar-
ter with a damaged knee, and
Tony Nicholakopoulous twisted
an ankle in the fourth quarter.

The first half was scoreless,
but Lekoma broke the deadlock

lwith a goal with 15 minutes gone

in the third quarter. The score
came on a penalty kick when a
West “Chester booter was penal-

ized for handling the ball. The,‘

in the match.

         
        
        
 
     
   
  
    
  

Coach Bemis felt that playing
on the new turf didn’t handicap
his team. Their unfamiliarity
with the different playing surf-
ace was equalized by the oppon-
ent‘s inexperience with artificial
grass.

to take advantage of the fast

turf, but they didn't quite make

er runners started to find the
holes the line was opening. Es-
posito increased his yardage to
91 before being injured. He also
scored the first Pitt TD from
three yards out.

Sprignoli came through where
Espostio left off when he replac-
ed him and the Panther’s sturdy
sub raced for 52 yards in 10
carries, including the big TD
with 2:26 remaining in the
game.

gnoli definitely sparked the team
and got the boys moving the
ball," the coach said.

Moving on the ground as well
as the Panthers did in the sec-
ond half, time rapidly disap-
peared and Baylor Coach Bill
Beall replaced the running Laney
Cook with his passing threat at
quarterback, Si Southall.

The Cats apparently stopped
Southall once, but gave up the
ball after DePasqua decided to
gamble.

The Panthers lined up for ‘a
Joe Spicko field goal attempt
for the Baylor 23-yard-line. De-
Pasqua called for a fake, but
Havern. who carried the ballg

‘was smothered .by Baylor per-

suer Dennis Watson.

Pitt goalie Marty Willem had
an easy time of it. being forced to
make only three saves. Pitt. on
the other hand, had over 50 shots
on Bradford's beleagured bastion.

“We could have beaten them by
more if we really wanted to em-
harass them,” commented new
JV coach Dick Slutzky, who also
doubles as assistant wrestling
coach. “I was more interested in
giving our reserves a chance to
play.” Every member of the 19

member JV team saw action ex-‘

in Saturday's II-O

victory over Bradford. Bolea is a forward from Rome, Italy. He is one of six
. foreign forwards on the-JV soccer team.

cept goalie George Hull of Wash-
ington, Pa., who has a foot infec-
tion andviewed the action from
the sidelines on crutches.

However, Saturday's JV game
at Pitt Stadium, the first soccer
match ever played there. was an-
other story as the opposition was
considerably tougher. to put it
mildly.

After leading, 2-1. on goals by
Roland and Maurer. the Allegheny
Community College Cougars scor-
ed four goals in the second half to
down the kickers, 5-2. _

Four of the Cougars’ five goals
were scored by Don Dreher and
Vince Pallato of Springdale, who
were both named to the WPIAL
All-Star Squad in their senior year
at Springdale. Dreher has now
scored nine goals in three games.
He scored 25 last year for the
Cougars.

Cougar Coach Kal Mecs. a for-
mer Hungarian Freedom Fighter
who also teaches 15 credits worth
of Math courses at Allegheny.
said. “We win but you (Pitt) have
a good team and play well. It was
a good game."

Mecs. whose Cougars were
number nine in the nation last
year, is 3-0 this year while Dick
Slutzky‘s soccermen are now 2-1.
They will try to make it 3-1
Tuesday against Allegheny's
South Campus, which they mauled

. last year, 8-0, with Ray Rex bang-
‘ ing in five goals. A victory against

ACC South would also clinch at
least a .500 season as the booters
only have two games (Cleveland
State and Penn State) remaining
after tomorrow’s encounter at the
All Purpose Field at 4 p.m.

manage to penetrate beyond the
20 line.

The Cubs’ only score in the
first half came as a result of a
high snap from the WVU center
to the punter at the Pitt goal
line. The ball rolled past the
end ' line giving the Cubs a
safety.

After an exchange of punts to
start the second half, the Cub of-
fense showed signs of coming
to life. They marched from their
own 20 yd. line to the WVU 14
before they were stopped just
short of another first down.

Rice carried the ball for the
Mounties on the next play, but
the Cub’s Jim Buckman chased
him back into the endzone for
another safety.

Halfway through the final
quarter, the Cub’s Bob Veillette
recovered a fumble on the Pitt
45-yard-line. On the next play,
Medwid connected with Stan
Ostrowski on a 55 yard pass
play for the Cub’s only TD.

 

Wilt Third
Match, 5-17

Pitt‘s tennis team defeated
Wheeling College. 4-1., last Thurs-
day for its third straight victory.

The match, played at Oglebay
Park, had been anticipated as be-
ing one of the team’s toughest.
due to the tournament caliber of
the Wheeling team. Wheeling has
won ten out of its last 11 matches
—its only loss being to Bethany
the day before the Pitt match.

"I" was delighted and pleased
about our victory.“ beamed Dr.
“Goldie" Edwards. the Pitt
coach. “We were forced to play
with a skeleton team. Someof
our regulars couldn’t make the
trip because of classes. However.
the girls played very well under
the circumstances.

In the number one singles
match Eileen Surdoval defeated
her opponent, Kathy Larkin, 6-2,
6-2. When Kathy walked off the
court after being defeated, Dr.
Andy Weber, Wheeling’s coach,
commented, “It was your new
tennis shoes that did it.”

Elaine Kingas defeated Patti
Loder. 6-0, 6-3, in the second sin-
gles match. Elaine was hitting
deep and her opponent just could-
n't pick up the base line balls. Pitt
was also the victor in the third
singles match. Joann Kotjan de-
feated Beth O'Connel, 6-2- 6-2.

Due to Wheelings lack of play-
ers, its number one and two sin-
gles teamed up to defeat Pitt's
number four and five players,
Mary Swallow and Lora Dunn. in
the first doubles match. The final
score was 6-0, 6-3——Pitt‘s only
loss. It was the first time Mary
and Lora had ever played togeth-
er in a match.

Michele Bertini and Marion
Klein defeated Wheeling. 7-5. 7-
5, in a marathon match in second
doubles. “We used a different
strategy this time," stated Mich-
ele. “Instead of playing net we
played base line." In both match-
es the girls came from behind and
defeated Wheeling.

er's choice. Ray Dozzi then fol-

. lowed with a single which scored

Henicle with the score, 5-3.

Delta met Kappa Sig (3-0).

Leadoff hitter Ray Dozzi sin-
gled and then forced at second by
Steve Kiser. Singles by Bob
Loughrey and Jerry Nowak res-
sulted in two runs for the Delts.

bases for Ray Barnhart to contin-
ue his torrid hitting with a double,
driving in Nowak and McGlone,
for two more runs.

Kappa Sig, fighting for the
same division championship as
DTD, went down in order leaving
the score 6-0 Delts after one inn-
mg.

In the second inning, the Delts

"*continued their barrage of runs

off‘ the pitching of Jim Lombardi.
Lombardi walked Steve Kiser,
Bob Loughrey, and Jerry Nowak
to load the bases. Denny McGlone
then hit a sacrifice fly, driving in
one run. Kennedy, Barnhard and
Henicle all singled to dirve in four
more runs. Five runs on three hits

and the Delts were ahead, 11-0, in
the top of the second.

Kappa Sig came back with two
runs in the bottom of the second
on singles by Ron Ghilani, Walt
Vukmanic and Tom Lang. but it
wasn‘t enough.

the fifth inning on a single by Bob
Lapore and ground outs by Bob
Madtes and Ray Dozzi.

Pika, Fiji
PiLam Tie

All of the fraternity softball ac-
tion ended on Friday. . . . Well, it
almost did. Two of the three
leagues were decided.

Pi Kappa Alpha had to beat Phi
Gamma Delta to win their divi-
sion. The Fiji‘s, however, were
not able to be denied a share of
the lead. Neither was Pi Lamb-
da Phi.

Fiji sent Pika down to defeat
for the first time. 4-1. Later, Pi
Lam defeated Delta Pi, 8-6. Now.
there is a three way tie for the
lead.

With the regular season over,
the three-way tie will have to be
decided in a playoff series.

The team that scored the most
runs in the regular season will get
a bye. The other two teams will
battle each other with the winner
meeting the "bye" team.

by JAN FRY

Pitt's women‘s field hockey
team bowed to C-MU last Thurs-
day in their first game of the sea-
son.

C-MU dominated the first half
of the game during which they
scored the winning goal. Pitt gain-
ed control of the ball in the second
half but to no avail.

"We were evenly matched."
stated De Burnstine. the Pitt
coach. “C-MU has a really good
foraward line; ours needs some
practice. However. we have a
strong defense. The girls played
a nice game and they have high
spirits."

Pitt’s offense consists mainly
of new players this season. Lynne
Blye, a freshman from eastern

Pennsylvania, played left wing .

and is the top forward line player.
Katrina Mataras, a veteran and
an active member of the varsity
rifle team, played left inner. She
and Lynne worked the ball down
left field a few times in the game
and made some good saves.

Jan Clouse played center for-
ward in the first half and Prissy
Conrad. a freshman from Win-
chester-Thurston, tool over sec-
ond half.

Jackie Adams, a senior and a
member of the gymnastics team.
held the position of right inner.
The regular right wing player. Sue
Gerhard, is out with a ham_ string
injury, acuired at practice. Kim

filling the gap in the offense.

“The forward line improved
the second half of the game,”
commented Coach Burnstine.

“They need more experience in

The defense is composed of
only two new players. The left
halfback position is held by Rose
Smith. a freshman with little pre-
vious experience. “She did an ex-
cellent job." remarked Pitt‘s
coach. "She has good timing and
speed. All that's needed is some
stick work."

Mary Longhery. another new
addition to the team, is from the
eastern part of the state and plays
right halfback. "She adds a lot of
class to the halfback defense."
stated the coach.

Phyllis Wojciechowski. the
team‘s manager and captain. is
playing center halfback this ses-
son. Shes noted for her inter
twining plays on the left side.

Bonnie Seifert, left fullback,
and Carolyn Weaver, right full-
back, are both upperclassmen.

Katie Whitman, the goalie. is a
quick. agressive player. She play-
ed in class last year and then de-
cided to join the team.

C-MU lost five major players
this year. Thus far they've had
one win and one loss——the latter
being to Chatham. "We have to
work on the basics." stated Miss
Fisk. the C-MU. "Pitt is playing
a lot better this year. They are in
better condition and have much
more zip than we do."
