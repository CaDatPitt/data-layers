. Plan Banquet

TO H0110!’ POl'l'S

James Potts is--no longer a mem-
ber of the University faculty. But
January 19, at the William Penn
hotel, members of the faculty and
student body, his former pupils
and his many University asso-
ciates will gather to honor the for-
mer intramural director at a testi-
monial dinner.

The banquet has been planned
and arranged jointly by students at
Pitt, the Tri-State Track associa-
tion, and the West Penn Physical
Education association, as a tribute
for the twelve years of fine service
Mr. Potts has rendered the Univer-
sity.

As intramural director, he had
occasion to become acquainted with
a great many Pitt students, and
through his genial manner, he be-
came one of the most popular fac-
ulty members on campus.

Volume 33, Number 38

Robert C. Machesney, adviser. to student publications
and instructor in journalism, yesterday submitted to Univer-
sity authorities his resignation in order to accept an appoint-
ment in the Department of Military Intelligence of the Unit-

ed States Army.

Mr. Machesney asked that his resignation be made effective

immediately, although he will

continue to conduct classes in 
journalism until close of the

semester next week.

No steps have yet been taken by
oﬂicials of the University to name
a successor to Mr. Machesney, but

. it is expected that, temporarily at

least, his responsibilities will be as-
sumed by other members of the
faculty and administration.

Mr. Machesney came to the Uni-

versity in Oiitober, 1938, as the 

, first member of the administration
to be placed directly in charge of
the undergraduate publicatiollio
Since that time he has been adviser
to both the editorial and businest

staffs of these publications. Begin- V

ning in September, 1939, he also
became instructor in journalism.

Before coming to the University
as adviser to student publications,
Mr. Machesney was graduated
from Pitt in 1932 and then served
as assistant director of publicity
here for several months. During
his undergraduate career, he was
editor for two years of the student
newspaper, then known as the Pitt
Weekly.

For ﬁve years Machesney travel-
ed throughout the United States,
Canada, Newfoundland, Alaska,
and Mexico in the interests of the
Carnegie Hero Fund commission.

During the pastfew years, Mr.
Machesney has also contributed a
number of acts and scripts used on
the nation-wide “We, the People”
program of the Columbia Broad-
casting system.

Brosky Sets awednesday  
For Owl Picture Deadline

Owl organization pictures must
be taken by Wednesday of next
week if the 1942 yearbook is to ap-
pear on campus the week of April
20. John Brosky, C42, editor, re-
vealed today that the Owl will at-
tempt to be current by having pho-
tographs and writeups of all cam-
pus events that have resulted from
the United States declaration of
war. /

“Concentrated and intense work
by the Owl staff will be necessary
to complete the revised makeup of
the yearbook to include all draf-
tees, volunteers, and other campus
war activitiea that will be in the

1942 book," said Brosky.

Final proofs of photographs
must be ‘sent to the printer by Feb-
ruary 20. “As a result of this,” said

Billy Anne Swank, C42, organiza- »

tion manager of the Owl, “the or-
ganizations listed in the following

scheduleunust appear at 24 Cathe-

dral at the times indicated. There

no (rescheduling if the or-
iaatiour’-" does» at appear. a

“All the organizations in the fol-
lowing schedule have not yet been
notiﬁed of the time of the picture
so I ask that the president of each
group please see to it that the
group shows up.”

UDC Prepares
Air Raid Data

Plans for air-raid precaution
training, equipment, and signals, as
part of the University’s civilian de-
fense program, will be ofiicially an-
nounced today.

Dr. Einar W. Jacobsen, dean of
the School of Education and UDC
coordinator, together with other
members of Pitt's civilian defense
council, worked during the two-
week Christmas vacation period to
formulate detailed plans.

He declared that a “red-hot pro-
gram already nears completion.”

The program will include ﬁre-
marshals, ﬁrst-aid provisions, and
ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment for each
ﬂoor of the Cathedral, places of
shelter and means for transfering
students from station to station.

To aid University defense near-
ly 70 students in the School of
Medicine relinquished their Christ-
mas vacation in order to take ad-
vanced courses in ﬁrst-aid work.

Higher Education  The War

In addition to drafting the ten-
tative calendar described, the Board
also heard a report from Mr. Fitz-
gerald on proceedings at an emer-
gency session of the National Con-
ference of College and University

Presidents, which he, together with ’

Chancellor John G. Bowman and
Dr. Crawford, attended last week-
end at Baltimore, Md.

The conference, main topic of
which was “Higher Education and
the War” aimed at ﬁnding the place
of colleges and universities in the
United States’ war elfort.

Although Mr. Fitzgerald was un-

able to release to the Pitt News

the speciﬁc nature of the discus-
sions at Baltimore, he summarized
the resolutions of the conferences
as pertaining to:

Mid-Western Teams, Otto Graham’
Fail To lmpress Coach Carlson 

Every time Pitt sends an ath-
letic aggregation out to the Mid-
West the team returns home to
ﬁnd the same question prevailing,
“What’s wrong with our team?”

It happened last fall after the Pur-
due, Michigan, and Minnesota
football games, and is now hap-
pening all over again since the dis-
astrous invasion of the Mid—West
by the basketball squad.

The logical person .to answer
that question is Dr. H. Clifford
Carlson, Pitt’s basketball coach.
The other day we went up to the
Doctor’s ofﬁceand‘ in reply to the
above query, he replied, “Nothing.
’We have a good basketball team.”
And he meant it too.

Further explaining his stand in
the face of the three losses sus-
tained at the hands of Northwest-
ern, Butler and Indiana, Carlson
stated, “We would’ve beaten North-
western and Butler on our gﬂoor.”
He explained that the ‘O (lifferent
systems of officiating in the two
sections had a lot to do with the
outcome of the games.

In the.Mid—West the oﬁicials give P

the offense a lot of leeway and con-
centrate on the defense. Here in
the East the direct opposite is true,
with the oﬂiciials watching the of-
fense. more closely than the .13-
fense.

Car-lson— called the Mid-West,
“the Death Valley of basketball.”

All of the teams play a rougher O

and tougher brand of ball than is
seen around here. In the North-
‘western game every ,Pitt player
came off the floor with brush
burns. Carlson wasn’t trying to
make excuses for the team or to
baby them, but just tried to point
out that Pitt wasn't used to that
style of play..«

In regard to Otto Graham who
has been receiving rave notices
‘from the Chicago writers, Carlson
called him a pretty good. player,
but stressed the fact that he
wasn’t a great player.
son’s opinion there are a couple of
boys on the Pitt teanrwho are 
good as Otto Graham.

How then does Graham, who has
been sparking the Wildcat team
thus far this year, compile the
amazing number of points that he
has? VVe asked some of the play-
ers about him and here are some
of the answers.

One of the‘ Panther regulars
callead him “a machine gun” as
far as shooting goes. He stated
that all Graham pcloes from the
opening whistle to the end of the
game is shoot.

The government needs women draughtsmen and
will pay their tuition while they learn their jobs.
Fifty-eight courses are available to girls with proper

drawing and computation. All courses are vital to
defense and all are open to women, according to L.
C. McCandliss, professor and head of _ the depart-
ment of civil engineering. ,When trained, the girls
will have a choice of callings, even to highway en-
gineering. Classes are held evenings and daytime.

Government Calls Womeni,Draughtsmen
For Chemical, Highway Engineering

A call has been issued for women draughtsmen,
by L. C. McCandliss, professor and head of Civil en-
gineering, to enter courses set for the government
under the Engineering, Science, Management, and
Defense program by the University.

Hundreds of women are being called to enroll in
this as well as ﬁfty-eight other courses in civil and
chemical engineering, highway engineering, machine

design,’ and others.

The government will pay the tuition of any wom-
an who can qualify for these courses. Qualiﬁcation
is sufficient training in mathematics, according to
McCandliss.

“Good jobs can be had when the courses are finish-
ed,” continued McCandliss, “the girls can find imme-
diate work provided they stick to their training and
properly qualify themselves.”

A ﬁeld where women may find employment, at
once is highway engineering. E. L. Schmidt, district
engineer of the Pennsylvania department of highways,
states, “We would like to put 30 or 40 trained women
to work right now. All a girl needs is a good high
school mathematical background and then with suffi-
cient training she could make a good draughtsman.
Girls might even be better than men; they are more
artistic.”

AFTER EXAMSAARE OVER RELA X
1942 JUNIOR PROM

“The highway course conducted at the University
during the summer of 1941 resulted in our employ-
ing twenty of its graduates in our office and ﬁeld
forces.”

After explaining that their ﬁeld forces have been
seriously depleted by competition with industry and
enlistments in the military and naval forces, Mr.
Schmidt went on to say, “I see in these courses an
opportunity for the development of new employees
and for training present ones to increase their value
to us.”

The draughtingroom of the Pennsylvania depart-
ment of highways in the Wabash building is ready
to go on a co-ed basis according to R. E. Boyer, plans
engineer. ' ’

“Drawing boards and high stools will be given to

anyone with sufficient training,” stated Boyer.
“The man,-needs of industry are_such that We will

have to look to women replacements and I therefore,

trust that the University will see ﬁt to encourage
the registration of women for the elementary cours-
es,” continued Boyer.

“And,” he went on,.“as we know, every girl em-
ployed in industry releases a man for the‘ armed
forces.”

These classes, which are vital to defense, will be
held both in the evening and during the day. Infor-
mation concerning them may be obtai‘ ad from Mr.
McCandliss, head of the departmern, Jf civil en-
gineering.
