  Metzger Lists Basis
Of Student Unrest

Columbia history professor Walter Metzger explored the sub-
tleties of student unrest and kikened student activists to religious re-
formers last Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the Hotel Webster Hall-‘s University
"Room.

Dr. Metzger, recently elected to Columbia's new tripartite Sen-
ate, emphasized the need for a “relegitimation of authority on cam-
pus” at a meeting of the American Association of University Profes-

Bill Changes Aid Formula

(See Editorial, Page 4)

During last week's meeting of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council Dr. Daniel Rathbun pre-
sented his formula for distribution
of University funds. His proposed
formula will replace the present
system of distribution, which was
referred to as “much table pound-

Discussion of the Rathbun for-
mula. which the council decided
to discuss at greater length in fu-
ture meetings, led to discussion of ,
another formula for distribution
of funds. The State Legislature is
currently planning a standard for-
mula for distribution of state
funds to the three state universi-
ties, Temple, Penn State, and the

sors (AAUP ).

Rejecting the notion that cam-
pus turmoil today stems from
nothing more than the conflict of
generations, Dr. Metzger argued
that today’s student movement is
unique. “Campus disorders,” he
declared, “cannot be attributed
solely to youth’s traditional de-
sire to wrest the reins of power
from established authorities.”

Sweeping aside another popular
theory, the Columbia professor
denied that today’s radical move-
ment represents a resurrection of
Hitler’s fascism. “The new left,”
he maintained, “is neither sadis-
tic, power hungry, nor authoritar-
ian.”

After dismissing several the-
ories, the middle-aged historian
suggested that the “prolongation
of adolescence” may be partially
responsible for widespread stu-
dent discontent. According to Dr.
Metzger, an extensive time lapse

New Fall Course To Probe Human

One year and seven months, hundreds of meet-

ings, and persistence by dedicated student-faculty _

committee has produced CAS 1—a three credit
course in Human Sexuality to be taught this fall.

Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe, associate director and
chief of psychiatry at the Student Health Center,
has been appointed course coordinator. Two under-
graduate students, Toni - 
Grossi and Bill Sahr,
are associate coordina-
tors.

Registration opens to-
morrow for this course
which is designed “to

between childhood and adulthood facilitate greater un-  4_ __ ye‘; 
“promotes skepticism and self- derstanding of human    ‘
righteousness among adoles- sexuality as-part of the SHEHA SCHUMACHE

The Columbia professor admit-
ted, however, that such an ex-
planation was inadequate and in-
complete. Turning to another in-
terpretation of campus turmoil,

ure to cope with the evils which

the students. It is necessary to the general educa-
tion of any student because we as students, need a
better understanding of ourselves.”

. This year. sponsored by the Associated Women
Students and the University YWCA, a three-day for-
um, including speakers, films, and panel discussion
was held. An evaluation questionnaire _showed that
97 per cent of the students polled wanted some
form of a follow—up to the forum. Fromgthis has
grown a speaker series and the course on Human

’ Sexuality.

There is written support from all facets of the
University inc.luding 120 faculty members, 30
student organizations, and 850 individual under-
graduate students (an incomplete figure as of
March 17, 1969).

Sheila Schumacher, director, University YWCA,
said that “this course is a breakthrough because
this has been the first course for which both stu-

‘ dents and faculty have worked.” She stressed that

this is the first course not in a specific department;
that is is an experimental course; and that profes-
sors from different disciplines will be giving lec-

.tures'and acting as discussion group leaders.

The participants will be required to attend four
one-hour lectures scheduled throughout the term.
The six recitation sections will meet for two hours

The state formula will divide the
state’s allotment according to the
amount of teaching productivity
attained by the individual schools.
This productivity is determined
by multiplying the number of hours
teachers teach times the number
of students taking the hours.

Under the present state system,

the University receives a main- .

tenance fee from the state, which
goes toward the payment of teach-
ers and other expenses of running
the University._ This fee is added
to the student tuition money, giv-

Proctor Stresses  
Relevant Education

by BOB BON N
Staff News Writers

Ralph Proctor, new assistant to the dean in the CAS,
finds the most important aspect of his job is making sure
that the education given at the University is relevant to
all students. V

Items he finds important are the language require-

ment, mandatory evaluation of instructors, the necessity V

of grades, and the necessity of declaring a major.

But being black, Proctor is especially sensitive to the
problems of blacks and other culturally different groups.

' “The total picture of education has to change to reflect the

experience and culture of black people, and not just in the
area of black studies.”

For example, an art teacher just can't teach a course
on the history of art and not mention the contributions of

. blacks. The only truly American music has its roots in the

black society.
“Every area of American culture has been touched -by

Qvﬁilack people. Real progress will be made. according to

 needs of black students are

» _ (Coiithzuerl on Page 2)

Proctor. “when white students start taking courses in
Afro—American history, for example. It‘s no good just for

me to learn about black contributions to society."‘

One thing which Proctor feels is lacking now is “the
right of a black person to go to a predominantly white uni-
versity and still remain a black person. The trend is now
to turn him into a darky pig-
mented white person. He
should have the right to re-
tain his culture.”

To accomplish this Proc-
tor would like to see "some
sort of review on all cours-
es in the college to see if
they reflect the culture of .
black people." ‘i

"My job is to see that the I

ther emphasized.‘ though.

'Pitt News Interviews
Gow Cites Need

  Of Experiinentation

by DIANE ULYON
Staff News Writer

, Contrary to popular belief the administration is not
unaware of the need for educational reform. While the fac-
ulty and students have changed curriculumrequirements
and discussed the need for innovations in college-level ed-
ucation, the administration has tried to determine the

 

most effective way to restructure the curriculum and in-‘

troduce the latest research principles on education. ‘
Unfortunately the lack of personnel, time, and mon-

i ey have stymied the experimentation and implementation

of scientific findings at the University to any successful
degree. However, after examining the facts one question
the true administrative commitment to the need for re-
forms.

Dr. Steele Gow serves asthe executive director of
the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC)
and as the associate provost for instructional experimen-
tation. His task is to bridge the gap between scientific
knowledge and curriculum innovations to create a more
productive educational experience geared to the needs of
the individual student. His recent appointment asthe act-
ing dean of,the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has diverted
his time from his primary functions.

Dr. Gow emphasizes the need for experimentation
before innovation, “with changes there must be a study
to measure the results.” He points out that impressive
strides have been made in educational reforms at the pre-
college level. ‘

_ “We have to gear up this lethargic, slowly moving
thing we call a University” and reform its educational
techniques. Dr. Gow’s office attempts to encourage inno-
vations suggested by the faculty as well as to implement
programs determined successful by scientifice measures.

Gow's philosophy for University‘ innovations is guid-
ed by the findings of the LRDC at the pre-college level and
his past experience at Bucknell University. “We have to
get at the problem. Students have the feeling that they are

‘partof a mass treadmill and being treated like numbers.”

The LRDC has devised a program of “Individually

Club legally Right’  

Said Duquesne Pres.

Last Friday, ten members of the University com-
munity were arrested on disorderly conduct charges at

the Duquesne Club downtown. They were reading a state— f

ment of opposition to the Vietnam war.

In an exclusive interview with the president of the
Duquesne Club, George Stinson, the Pitt News found that’
the officials of the club have different opinions than those
of the demonstrators.

Said Stinson, “When anyone, for whatever reason,

forces an entry into the club and disrups the functioning
of the club, the general man- '-
-ager is in order to ask them
to leave, and, if they do not
leave, to call the police.
Legally there is no question
of our right to do this.

“The purpose of what
they were trying to say is 
irrelevant.”

Throughout the interview, I
Stinson stressed that busi-
nessmen are human, too,
and that it was regrettable
that such strong measures GEORGE SHNSON
had to be taken with the demonstrators.

‘Further, Stinson said that a letter to the appropriate
businessmen would probably have obtained better results.
“I’m sure that such a letter would reach my desk.”

   
 

When questioned further on his idea of sending a letter
to businessmen, Stinson refused to be pinned down. Ex-
plaining that National Steel has few Defense Department
contracts because of the nature of the steel they produce,

he felt that a letter urging him to stop producing war ma- -

terials would be inappropriate.

Stinson also refused to comment on a hypothetical
case, saying that “I’d have to know'all the circumstances
first, and I’d have to see such a letter.”

He also declinedcomment on what results would be

Staff News Writer

The University of Pittsburgh Theater will present Little_Malcom

' and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs by David Halliwell tomorrow
i I through Saturday.

The comedy explores the vise of fascist organizations and the

‘often included sexual inadequacies of those responsible. This is ac-
A complished through a self-styled fascist campus dictator who attempt

to form a movement to take over the campus and eventually the
world.

The play is directed by Dr. Leland Starnes, chairman, Theater Di-

I - vision, who also directed the extravaganza Causcasian Chalk Circle

this year. Although this IS only his first year at the University, Dr.
Starnes has shown that he is unafraid to tackle controversial or mam-
moth o cts.

RTRAYING STUD NT revolutianairies in the upcoming Theatre produc-
tion, Little Malcolm and the Eunuchs, are (from left to right): Greg le-
hane, Jim Hulin, Val Mayer, and Dan Nalbach. The play begins tonight
and runs until Saturday.

Appearing in the play are Gregory Lehane as Little Malcolm,
James Hulin, Val Mayer, Daniel Nalback and Cathy Rennick. All are
accomplished Pitt Theater veterans. Settings are designed by Henry
Heyman, lighting by Richard Evans, and costumes by Cynthia Taylor
Krich.

that this is not done for blacks
alone. “During Reconstruction af-
ter the Civil War, for example,

vmany laws were passed to give

rights to the blacks which also
benefited white people, such as
rights to equal education.”

Proctor outlined several addi-
tional changes he would like to
see. A mandatory evaluation of
all instructors and professors in
the College would be of “para-
mount importance.”

“Students have a right to eval-
uate their instructors. If it's
found that he’s not really instruct-
ing, his services should be term-

T inated, and he should consider do-

ing something else for a living,
like selling shoes.”

Other questions in Proctor’s
mind involve the necessity of
grades and the declaration of a

, major.’ He expressed the hope

that credit can be given for exper-
ience (“Like, if he’s worked in the
neighborhoods, why should he have

When asked if he thought the

he welcomed change. “Let’_s face

recent ousting of ten University
personnel from the Duquesne
Club, he commented that “having
participated in riots. sit-ins, etc..
and having been arrested for it in

wrong." ’

Proctor stressed that there is
no reason why a student should
wait until he’s in trouble to’ visit
the Dean's office. His main func-
tion, he explained, is to help the

students. He doesn’t consider
himself a “college administra-
tor.”

°Stu(Ient Unrest Religious’

(Continued from Page 1)

The eloquent academician ar-
gued that “persistent racial injus-
tice, the presence of widespread
poverty, compulsive military
service, a burgeoning bureaucra-
cy, a ghastly war, and the specter
of a nuclear holocaust” distress
students deeply and provoke cam-
pus disturbances.

However, he wondered out loud
“why nations not engaged in the
War in Vietnam, not poisoned by
racial injustice, without nuclear
weapons, and without the draft"
should be plagued with student re-
bellion. Refusing to repudiate the
Amherst College statement, he
nevertheless labeled it deficient.

After discrediting a sufficient‘
number of arguments, the articu-
_late speaker finally revealed his
own theory. “The current student
movement,” Dr. Metzger con-
tended, “bears many resem-
blances to historic religious _move-
rﬁents, particulary the Protestant
Reformation.”

He explained that both the Prot-
estant Reformation and this de-
cade’s student movement ap-
peared during periods of material
prosperity and cultural productiv-
ity. Both movements involved
moral protest against injustice
and hypocrisy. And immediately
before the rise of both movements,
the student population increased
dramatically.

Obviously enjoying the analogy,
the witty professor pointed out
that Martin Luther hadn’t shaved
for weeks when. he nailed his de-
mands to the door of Wittenburg
Cathedral. Likening the Catholic
Church’s sale ofindulgences to
the university’s involvement in
war research, he also compared

"the “venality_ of the clergy” with

the “sell-outs of the professori-
ate.“

Stale Formula
(Continued from Pagell)

The new state system will fig-
ure the.University’s expenses for
a fixed period,- subtract the stu-
dent tuition money from this, and
pay the rest. According" to a num-
ber of deans, professors and Uni-
versity officials, this new sys-
tem will prohibit much experi-
mental work in the academic area
and encourage larger classes to
boost the amount of teacher pro-
ductivity. ~

Much of the discussion during
the FASC meeting concerning the
Rathbun formula pertained also
to the state formula. Many of the
objections raised were in regard
to the teacher producitivity.

Acting Dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Steele Gow
said that the teaching productivity
is used to a certain extent in the
present system of dividing the
University's funds in the College.

In defense of his formula. Dr.
Rathbun noted that under the
teacher productivity system. the
college would receive more «of
the University's funds than — it
presently receives.

Elaborating on his theory, Dr.
Metzger noted the “religious
prompting behind modern revolu-
tionism.” He also pointed to the
“apocalyptic vision and idealistic
fervor” of the committed stu-
dent. “Alienated radicals,” he
concluded, “are asking of politics
what before was asked of reli-
gion.”

Where, the engaging historian
asked rhetorically, are campus
disturbances most likely to oc-
cur? At universities with a strong
liberal arts curriculum, a respec-
table percentage of black under-
graduates, and a large number of
students with high verbal Scholas-

A tic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores.

Columbia, he chuckled, was
justsuch a university. Recalling
the exciting events of last April
and his participation on a faculty
committee which sought to re-
solve the crisis, Dr. Metzger de-
scribed in vivid detail the occupa-
tion of Hamilton, Fayerweather,

iMathematics, and Avery Halls,

,cause it too was symbolic.

and Low Library.

The protest centered around
two issues. Students were dis-
turbed by Columbia’s ties with the
Institute of Defense Analysis and
by the administration’s plan to
construct a gymnasium in Morn-
ingside Park on a ghetto recrea-
tional site.

In Dr. Metzger’s opinion, the is-
sues were largely symbolic. The
Institute of Defense Analysis
symbolized the War in Vietnam
and the horror of modern weap-
onry. The gym represented Amer-
ican imperialism ‘and America’s
ill treatment of her neighbors.

According to Dr. Metzger, Col-
umbia’s faculty opposed the stu-
dents’ demand for amnesty be-
“in
calling for an amnesty,” the sen-
ior professor explained, “the pro-
testors were in effect questioning
the legitimacy of the administra-
tion’s authority.”

Defending the faculty’s posi-
tion, the Columbia professor stat-
ed that most teachers viewed the
administration’s authority as le-
gitimate. “As a result,” he main-
tained, “the faculty could only op-

pose the students’ demand for

pudiated the administration’s use
of force to end the sit-in. ”

Denouncing the administration
for calling in the police, Dr. Metz-
ger criticized the law officers for
“punishing indiscriminately and
acting viciously.” He soberly cas-
tigated the police for “breaking
the social contract and jeopardiz-
ing the legitimacy of authority” at
the ivy league school.

Labeling justifiable disrespect

for authority as the principal g
cause of college disturbances, the’

perceptive historian called for a
“relegitimation of authority” on
campus. “Universities must be
drastically refurbished so that
they will be worthy once more of
the young person’s respect,” he
declared.

While contending that the gov-
ernment in particular ought to
change its policies and relegiti-
mize its authority, Dr. Metzger
argued that “the university must
go it alone if other institutions
don’t make the effort.” He prais-
ed those colleges which have al-

tively in the decision-making pro-

‘Experiments Must Preeede Change

IPI consists of planning and
conducting with each student a
program of studies that is tailor-
ed to his learning needs and to his
characteristics as a learner. The
rate of speed at which each stu-
dent works depends on his own ca-
pacitites. He places himself on
the continuum (the sequential or-
der of course material) by taking
placement tests.

A student works independently
to build a sense of responsibility
and confidence about his educa-
tion.

while still fulfilling the require-
ments for his bachelor’s degree.

The upperclass independent
study would hopefully encourage
students to develop a capability
for independent study that is cur-

graduate level.

The continuous progress plan
(CPP) has been one of Bucknell's

trative difficulties in keeping tabs
on 300 students in a CPP philoso-

phy sequence. A university must‘
also have the funds and personnel

available to initiate more individ-
ualized education.

‘Dr. Gow realizes that one of the
greatest problems is “releasing
personnel (from their current du-
ties) to develop materials for
self-instruction." The implemen-
tation of new curriculum and in-
structional methods would» re-
quire that faculty members of
each department construct cours-
es and suitable materials to facil-
itate profitable innovations.

Dr. Gow- says there have been
“excessive expectations" about
the output of his office. But he
seems to‘ feel these expectations
are overly optimistic at this early
stage. The problems faced by
Bucknell with the CPP would be
magnified at the University which
has about eight times the enroll-
ment of Bucknell.

Dr. Gow's presence on the ad-
ministrative staff represents a
realization of the need for educa-
tional change. The additional du-
ties which have been placed upon
him as the acting dean of the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences leads
one to question the administra-
tion’s commitment to this need.

Add to this the obstacles to apply- I

ing new educational techniques

near-future innovations of major

the University of Pittsburgh,

Formula

Change

Someday all University classes may have the same number

of students in them.

Someday there may be only a minimum of courses from

which to choose electives.

Someday we may be alumni of Pittsburgh State Teachers

College.

These assumptions may seem ludicrous to some of you, but
if present trends continue in the State Legislature, these could

» be the results.

There is presently a proposed bill in Harrisburg which, it
passed, will dictate that funds for state universitites will be di-
vided over a period of years according to a formula based on

teacher productivity.

Many University employees in the forms of deans, teach-
ers, and planners feel that the University’s attempt to decrease

the number of students in classes and to offer new and special 4

classes will be seriously thwarted by this formula.

The University will suffer-because it is currently ahead of ‘

Temple and Penn State, the other state universities, in the area

of improved academics in the way of smaller classes, more A
- classes, and more qualified teachers for all classes. *

Unless the entire University community urges the State to
either keep the present formula or revise the new one before it
becomes law, the University will not receive the funds it needs
in the future to continue academic reform.

We can’t start a new department without funds. We can’t
start a new course without funds. We can’t keep excellent teach-

ers without funds.

But unless we make our voices known to the State, they will
pass the bill for the new formula. The new formula is easier to
figure, more rigid, more standardized, and because it will be for
a longer period of time than the present one, less of a bother to

the State than the present one.

Strong  

Feeling Of Nausea

by JERRY L. BRUEBEL

Among the letters on the edi-
torial page of Friday’s Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette was an “intellectual”
analysis of the University’s fund
raising problems, written by Jack-
son L. Obley, a Pitt alumnus.

“It is little wonder,” writes

'Obley, “that our alumni group

leaves something to be desired in
fund raising at our Pitt alma
mater. The reaction one gets when
he looks at the pictures in last
week’s papers at the attire of
three of Pitt’s alleged ‘professors’
prompts a strong feeling of nau-
sea.”

Perhaps Obley should, instead,
consider the reaction one gets
when he reads such utter fool-
ishness as it appeared amont “The
People Speak” letters. The au-
thor’s inability to cope with and"
understand the world around him
is a perfect example of the left
wing’s arguments that present
grade systems and degrees are
highly inadequate. Obley is ob-
viously no better equipped to
think now than he was before he
entered the University.

IT SEEMS ABSURD that some-
thing as trite as the clothes worn
. by a professor can disturb an in-
dividual to the extent that he finds
it necessary to inform the world
of such “perversities,” and yet
_ that same individual remains un-
spoken on the deprivity of Ameri-
ca’s war policy in Vietnam.

Perhaps Obley should first,

however, re-evaluate what he
finds so necessary to condemn. Is-
that “long-haired, /bead-adorned
group of “intellectual” campus
revolt leaders” any worse than
Richard M. Nixon, who everday
in a coat and tie, insists on sending
out young men _to kill and get
killed in an unjust and immoral
war?

If the failure of the University
to raise money from its alumni
is based on such feelings as Obley
so clearly described, than the fail-
ure is, in actuality, beneficial to
this institution of higher educa-
tion. The University need not waste
its time and effort in an attempt
to secure monies from people who
have not the slightest idea of the
meaning of freedom.

AND IF THE FAILURE of
the University to raise money
from its alumni is based on such
feelings, then surely there ‘are
other people to be found who
will contribute financial support
to Pitt’s moral obligation and
sincere attempts at progress.

But 0bley’s feelings of nau-
sea are not to be ignored, or laugh-
ed at if not ignored. The Pitt
alumnus and many others like
him are suffering from a sickness
inherited from a society of which
we are all a part. Misunderstand-
ing is a sickness which all of us
should, but don’t strive at curing.
It is for such a sickness. Obley‘s
sickness, that this writer has
feelings of nausea.

(Asked Any (Questions Latelyjf

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer

There is something missing
around this school. Honesty!
Almost everyone — teachers, stu-
dents, administrators, scream.
write, and confront each other
for hours on end. What do we
generally do? Nothing!

I was just told that I couldn’t
review a dress rehearsal of “Lit-
tle Malcolm” because The Pitt
News is “biased.” If anything.
If anything, I’m biased towards,
the theater department. I worked
on or was in three shows this year
and am taking a theater course

right now. The director could have
very simply stated that the produc-
tion was not ready for review. I
then would have written an ar-
ticle announcing Spring Pro-
duction and that would have been
all. What really makes me angry
is that someone from the depart-
ment has been giving us the dates
of rehearsals, cast listings, pic-
tures, and has been asking us to
see for ourselves what is going
on. When I went to see, I was
turned away. Why the hypoc-
risy?

One week ago, I began being
honest with myself for the first

time. I discovered that I had been
tolling myself for eighteen years.
Suddenly it became easier to be
honest than to be deceptive with
not only myself, but with every-
one around me. Maybe I_expect
too much from everyone else.

I'M SITTING NEXT to that
poster of Dustin Hoffman saying
“What’ll you do after you gradu-
ate?” I don’t know and I don’t
care. I don’t even know what I’ll
be doing tomorrow. How many
other kids are sittingaround here
thinking the same thing but are
afraid to admit it?

tries to cling to an individuality that an increasing-

newspaper office inquiring about its exclusion. I

told the caller that it was my understanding that the _

story on the lecture had been written and was left
out of that issue due to space limitations.

The next edition of The Pitt News also failed to
carry this article. The gentleman phoned again and
I spoke with him. At that time, I consulted Staff
News Editor Anne Dorn who informed me that the
story would be published in the following news:
paper, which would have been last Tuesday’s edi-
tion. I promised the caller that the Angaye lecture
would be included in that issue, a promise that re-
gretably has not been fulfilled.

Two days prior to publication Anne told me

- that she had just found out that the assigned repor-

ter had not been able to write an article on the lee-
ture. Being that the staff is often long on articles
to be covered and short on reporters, it is sometimes
difficult to find someone to cover a certain event. The
reporter in question (like other members of the
staff) hasibeen covering to to four stories a week, a

considerable burden for someone who must also at-.41..

tend classes during the day and study in the even-
ing. Unfortunately the reporter had another obliga-
tion scheduled for thirty minutes after the start of
the talk. He stayed for the half hour but didlnot
get enough information to be able to do the speak-
er justice. Therefore, the story was never printed.

Last Tuesday, the day the newspaper was dis-
tributed, Mr. Angaye came to The Pitt News of-
fice in person to find outwhy his lecture was once
again omitted. Before I could offer an explanation
he said, “I know why, you are pro-Biafra and do not
want to print the other side of the story.” ,

I gave my apologies to Mr. Angaye and told him
of the difficulties the staff has had in trying to pub-
licize his lecture. I am writing this column because
I don’t believe that Mr. Angaye and I understand
each other.” This is unfortunate.

I gave him an explanation for the error of omis-—

sion, but not an excuse. There is no excuse for a
newspaper to miss an event. The Pitt News en-
deavors to cover all news happenings but occasional-
ly one will slip away.

For the record. The Pitt News has never made an
editorial statement on the Nigerian Civil War. Even
if a stand had been taken. The Pitt News believes
that diversity of opinion is a newspaper’s greatest
strength and has never repressed or censored an ar-
ticle that deviated from an opinion expressed in an
editorial. . The newspaper always keeps its pages
open to all schools of thought.

The omission of coverage of Mr. Angaye’s lec-
ture is an unfortunate error, but by no means was
the exclusion. intentional. The staff once again of-
fers its sincerest apologies and asks Mr. Angaye
and the University community to try to understand
us and realize some of the pressures that we work un-
der. The staff also invites Mr. Angaye to present
an article explaining his views _on the Nigerian Civ-
il War for publication.  ' '

TWO SIGNIFICANT questions were
raised in Berkeley, Calif., during the last
two weeks: Who should control and ad-
minister private porperty owned by a uni-
versity and at what point does anticipa-
tion become provocation.

The situation which has since evolved
into a battle between students and mem-
bers of the community hurling flowers
and insults and police hurling gas pellets
and bullets revolves around the construc-
tion of a park.

Seven months ago, the University of
California at Berkeley purchased a tract
of land from the city with the end in mind
of constructing new dormitories. In the
process, the people living in this area
were evicted from their homes and forced
to set up residence elsewhere. '

When the University took no action
for six months, the Berkeley Barb, an
underground newspaper, initiated a move-
ment to turn the vacant lot into a park to
be built and used by students and mem-
bers of the community.

IT BECAME A DAILY thing for the
sundry group to clean up the dirt lot,
plant trees and prepare the park for open-
ing. Then the University stepped in to
stop them. A fence was erected on the ra-
tionale that since it was University prop-
erty, the University would be liable if
someone were hurt.

Joseph Bartl, reporter for the Daily

for the constructed barrier was the fear
of the University that permitting students
to administer university property would
set a dangerous precedent.

The reaction of the University was
matched by the overreaction of Berke-
ley officials and Governor Reagan. Be-
fore anything resembling violence had oc-
curred, a state of Marshall Law was an-
nounced. A 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew
was enacted in the area and a contingent

‘of the National Guard was dispatched,

the National Guard unit which had served

- as the Watts Riot Brigade.

ALTHOUGH FACED WITH threat
(and provocation?), the role of the work-

ers remained a peaceful one. When the

chairman of the Academic Affairs Com-
mittee refused to call a meeting to dis-
cuss the issue, the Berkeley Faculty of
the American Federation of Teachers
threw its support behind the workers-
turned-demonstrators.

Owen Chamberlain, 1959 Nobel Prize
Winner in Physics, found himself among
the more than 146 intimidated by police
in a two-day period when he attempted to
carry on a vigil on the steps of Sproul
Hall, the building housing the School of
Journalism; Most of the 146 were ar-
rested.

Nevertheless, the Californian report-
er insisted that “milling around” in
street, park and campus areas was the
“most action” taken by the demonstra-
tors. Their efforts toremain non-violent
were met by threats and ultimately gun-

while tryirig to prevent a demonstrator
from hurling a brick at a policeman. An-
other man lost his eyesight from a gun-
shot in the face fromthe police.

THE TROUBLE OF California a stu-
dents bring back memories of Senator
Fleming and his infamous resolution. The
call for the “extreme emergency” situa-
tion of Marshall Law was founded only on
suspicion of intent to violence. The psy-
chological effect of sending the Watts
Riot Brigade to a peaceful area before
anything had happened could have set up
a fear situation, strong to provoke vio-
lence instead of averting it.

V But even more frightening was the
falsity of the University rehetoric. While
claiming that it was attempting to be-
come “relevant” to the community, it
turned around and squashed one of the

most productive attempts at university--

community action. The issue was private
property and who can control it.

It is quite clear that the administra-
tion at Berkeley defines itself as “the uni-
versity.” If not,_ how could it have ignored
the combined requests of students and

 Force Major Asks Pitt Le

Mr. G. Herbert McCracken,
Chairman, Student Affairs and
Education Committee

Board of Trustees

University of Pittsburgh

Fifth Ave. and Bigelow Blvd.

May 13, 1969

Dear Mr. McCracken,

As a member of the National
ROTC committee of the Reserve
Officers Association I would like
to present some thoughts and
opinions for the consideration of
your committtee.

‘I am sure all parties concerned
with the university would prefer

- to have the current campus un-

rest resolved without new laws at
either the state or national level.
I believe it can be resolved with-
out laws if those that have the re-
sponsibility for providing fair
leadership will only exercise their
authority. This starts with the
Board of Trustees.

It is my understanding that the
board has two responsibilities
within their jurisdiction which
would do much for resolving the
ROTC controversy at Pitt, if ex-
ercised:

1.Stating the policy of the uni-
versity toward ROTC. ‘

2.Selecting and/or retaining
administrative people at the uni-
versity who will implement and
support stated policies of the
board of trustees.

Without getting mired down in
the details of number of credits
for the ROTC program, it is es-
sential that in the overall interest
of true academic freedom and the
national security that it be the po-
licy of the university to have
ROTC courses offered as part of
the curriculum for appropriate
credits; that this program should
be on a voluntary basis available
for those students who choose to
participate. In fairness to‘ the stu-
dents who must carry the heavy
credit load for graduation and .in
reinforcing the military as an hon-
orable profession. it is essential
that ROTC" be carried as a valid

-"university program and not as an

 

‘  f‘

  
 

. .. a’

I feel sure it is necessary for
the board to state publicly that
something similar to the above is
is a policy established by the
board for the university and that
it is the board’s expectation that
the administrative people of the
university will support this po-
licy.

At no time during the contro-
versy on ROTC last fall did I see
or hear that the administration
made any statement for the bene-
fit of the faculty or committees of
the College of Arts and Sciences
giving historical justification for
ROTC being on campus, with ap-
propriate credits or without. At no
point that Iknow of was the con-
tent of the ROTC courses or teach-
ing of the military instructors
studied for quality by the commit-
tees that reported a recommenda-
tion of going from 16 credits for
the Air Force and 14 credits for
the Army to 0 credits.

The basis for removing credits
was limited to the fact that course
contentent, department adminis-
tration and assignment of mili-
tary personnel was not. under uni-
versity control; as clearly stated
in the recommendation by the
Academic Cabinet of the College
of Arts and Sciences  . . An out-
side party has control of both cur-
riculum and instructors. That
such a course be given for aca-
demic credit, seems to us_c1early
outrageous . . .’-’

Since this is the stated issue.
since this issue appears clearly"
within the province of your board
to decide whetehr in fact an ex-
ception should be made without
harm to the university and for the
benefit of all, allowing in this
case one department to exist as
part of the curriculum with outside
control for each contract period.
it appears your choice to state the
policy in which you believe.

That your board has too much .

latent power to suitsome is ac-
centuated by elements wanting to

» have student representatives take

away a piece of the action in dean
hiring’ and firing. Student‘ repre-

sentation on committees in i the

Majority Disapproves?

In a survey commissioned by Standard Oi
Company (New Jersey) and conductedby Rap]
er Research Association, it was learned tliat”.
“the great majority of college students sa-
they have never used either marijuana or LS!)
and don't intend to. Most also disapprove o
sexual promiscuity and adhere to traditiona
-religious beliefs." ' '

Only 24 per cent of all seniors, for exam
ple, have ever tried marijuana. A majority-o
these students have used the drug two or three—:_
times at the most. The survey also found that";
only nine per cent of these students described?‘
themselves as occasional or frequent users. I j - I 1

According to the survey, although most stu-.
dents have not used drugs and show no interest ;
in them, there is considerable feeling thatfj
marijuana laws should be liberalized. Almost?
half the seniors believe that the sale of mari-
juana should be made legal, but under controls_
such as with liquor. The same does not apply'to?j_;
LSD; only seven per cent would legalize its
sale. As proof of their reaction against LSD, the
statistics show that LSD has been used experi-
mentally by a very small number of seniors-
three per cent. » '

The students’ actual experiences and atti-_».
tudes towards such matters as drugs, sex, and“
religion differ sharply from popular impres-
sion. The survey tends to deflate another com-
mon belief. The prevalence of the" so-called‘
“generation gap.” Fully two-thirds of the fresh-
men and seniors interviewed reported that they
and their parents agree on most things. The
Roper study was initiated in the spring of
1968 when campus unrest was attracting’ in;
creasing attention; .

_This survey revealed that a great deal was 
being written and said about students’ beIiefs,: '
attitudes, and grievances, but little was really, '

little perspective was shown in
the faculty reports based on neg-
ligible investigation, no effort at
justification or perspective was

ROTC, the meeting of the faculty
in December where credit was re-
duced to 0 was improper and emo-
tional without considered agenda,
alternatives or parlimentary pro-
cedure. But the results of this
meeting were-considered as valid
and representative of the feelings
of the faculty. No effort has been
made to correct any of this. As a
result almost 10 per cent of the
undergraduate full time main
campus students have been dis-
credited in courses they and most
of the undergraduates felt were
valid curriculum courses. Think
of the impact this has on them.

A national trend of irrational
behavior is sweeping the almost
sacred institutions" of rational
learning. I believe this can and
will be reversed by forcing those
in authority to get back in touch
again, providing the leadership
that our young less experienced
people are looking for from them.

It is with deepest conviction-
that I recommend that your com-
mittee, after considering the
above, act to state a university
policy supporting ROTC on the
Pitt campus as outlined, restate
your expectation of administra
tive support and publicize your
decisions to both the public and
the faculty. Then I am sure we
will all see the University of Pitts-
burgh be the leader in reversing a
disruptive trend by ‘reestablishing
reason and order on campus.

- Last September, Smitty
" Brown finished last in races,
on a regular basis. The same
[thing could happen again next
fall, ‘ but it won’t disturb the
1‘ track star if it does.

.f_plains, “I’m not cut out for it.
- Out of all the guys, when the team
;.ran, I’d finish last, or next-to-
last- But, it didn’t worry me. It
helped me. It made me stronger.”

The distances were just too long

athlete who gains speed quickly.
.'In fact, last winter he was out-

"ting the varsity mark with a 1:

During the recent spring ses-
-‘sion the races have gotten even
--shorter, much to Brown's liking.

“In the two dual meets this
‘ season, the coach had me running
,the “I00” and the “220,” men-
’tioned Brown. “He wanted me to
.get in shape for the quarters
(440). That’s basically the same
_k_ind of race as the “600,” al-
- though the “600” is longer.”
‘Brown was looking forward to

' the IC4A’s meet over the week-

Traeksters Finish Strong Sixth In IC4-A’s »

Richey Triumplmnt

9 As Thinelmls Shine

by BOB LEDERMAN

If there was any uncertainty about the strength of Pitt
track in the East, it was erased this past weekend at the IC4A’s

in New Brunswick, N. J. The thinclads put together 15 points, _

good enough for a sixth place finish in the 93rd annual outing.

Jerry Richey provided the thinclad high spot of the two—day com-
petition. Running in 88-degree heat, Richey became the first IC4A in-

« dividual champion the thinclads

have boasted in 11 years. when he
easily won the gruelling 3-mile
race. Richey’s time of 13:41.4,
shattered his own university rec-
ord of 13:44.1.

For the 4500 fans on hand in
Rutgers Stadium, it was quite a
race. The first several laps saw
Richey pacing himself in the num-
ber four position. As the race pro-
gressed, Richey advanced to the

.9 ~ Brown "Running Good”

 

SMITTY BROWN
“Kind of Disappoin fed”

member» of the thinclad mile re-
lay team. He’s‘been anchoring that
quartet for quite awhile, now. And
at the IC4A’s, Brown helped
Banner’s relay team to a fifth-
place finish.

“It puts a'little pressure on me,”
Brown noted. “The guys count on
me. But,-the way I look at it they
do their jobs and I have to run
good.” ' ‘~

“Running good” is something
Brown seems to be doing all the
time. One begins to wonder if
he ever gets tired.

“You get your low points,” he
admitted. “I’ve been running
since August. You get stale, but
eventually you come out of it.”

So, what’s Smitty Brown go-
ing to do once the upcoming
NCAA meet is behind him?

“I’m gonna run a lot this sum-
mer," he said. “I didn’t last sum-
mer. The year before — right af-

ter high school — I did. I just '

want to be a lot stronger the next
time out.” A

number three slot, biding his
time until the “right moment.”
It was at the beginning of the
twelfth and final lap that Richey
decided it was show time. With
a strong kick that has become the
mark of his track prowess, he
picked up speed and took over the
lead from Yale’s Frank Shorter.
Richey maintained that lead with-
out any trouble.

Richey’s win marked the first
time since 1956 that Pitt had an
IC4A champion in a running
event. It had been thirteen years
since Herb Carper (100 Yard-
dash) and Arnie Sowell (880-
yard ruh) had captured gold
medals for the Blue and Gold.

Greg Rodgers supplied the
tracksters with a‘ pleasant sur-
prise, finishing second in the
steeplechase competition. Run-
ning the race for only the sec-
ond time in his life, Greg settled
into second place behind the win-
ner, Tom Donnelly of Villanova,
and never was challenged from
his runner-up spot after the mid-
way point. Greg’s only previous

attempt in the 1-3/4 mile race, re-
sulted in another successful show-
ing in the Penn Relays earlier in
the season.

Bryant Salter, troubled all sea-
son by an injured left heel, fin-
ished third in the triple jump,
breaking the sand at 48-0-1/2. Sal-
ter’s third place effort was well
below his own previous school
record of 49-11. One of Salter’s
jumps, however, appeared to be
well over 49 feet and possibly
far enough to win, but it dis-
allowed on a technicallity.

The mile relay team (Carlos
Reisen, Wally Swiger, Rudy Huf-
nagle and Smitty Brown), after
clocking top time in the trials,
finished fifth behind winner Vill-

anova with a time of 3:13.l. The
time, although only good enough
for a fifth place finish, set a new
Pitt record for the thinclad quar-

tet — the old record stood at 3 :l3;5 ’

(1957).

Other thinclad performers fea-
tured Dan Kouvolo in the
javelin (221-4, fifth place),
Dave Brinn in the 120 Yard
High Hurdle (did not place),.and
Carlos Reisen in the 440-Inter-
mediate Hurdles (did not place).

All in all, the men of Banner
had a fine weekend. They not
only had their best showing since
1958, but also let everyone know
that Pitt track is heading towards
national prominence.

Lin.k.sm.en. Close Out Another Year
Witlt Another Loss At Penn State

The golf team has not had
much of a chance to close out
recent seasons with a win,
and this year was no different
as Penn State dubbed the men of
Peery, 6-1.

The golfers had the same trou-

ble last year, against the same

team, and also lost 6-1. The Lions
finished 9-2 last year, but this
season, PSU finished with a 10-1
dual meet record and a second
place in the East.

Peery was not particularly
confident of a revenge victory,
and he had good reason as his
crew went down ‘easily to their
eighth defeat against only five
wins. ’

Tom Apple paced the Lion
win with a three under par 66
to defeat John Meteney after

The linksmen have always had
trouble handling their annual

Lion opponents. Dating back to
their first meeting in 1923, the
golf team has dropped 38 out of
44 matches to State, while winning
only 5 times and tying once.

But, of course, not many of Penn
State’s rivals have been too suc-

' cessful, as the Lions have compiled

a remarkable 117-26-1 record
over the last twelve seasons.

announced last week that three
area high school stars will enter
the University next fall.

_Jim Caramanna of Mt. Leban-
on, Gary McClure of Waynes-
burg, and Tim Mackuliak of
Leechburg will do their wrestling
as Panthers for the next four
years.

INTRAMURAL SOFTBALL

Going into the final week of
competition, weather permitting,
Delta Sigma Phi owns the top
spot in the International League

of the Summer Intramural Soft— '

ball League.

Delta Sigma Phi picked up the
second win of their perfect 3-0
record against Born Losers (1-2)..
In the first inning, Mark Payne
singled, Tony Esposito homered,
Lou Julianand George Richards
singled, and John Moss and Jack
Dykes sacrificed. The four run
outburst wasn’t enough, but Delta
Sig added three runs and won,
7-4.

Esposito, Julian, and Dykes
were the big Sluggers in Delta
Sig’s third victory, a 13-1 romp
over Sigma Chi (3-2).

Sigma Chi split its last two

games, losing to BS&T (1-2), 5-0, ‘ I

and beating Alpha Epsilon Pi
(3-2), 9-1. The victory over AE
Pi enabled_Sig Chi to move into
a tie for second place. 0

This ‘ afternoon, Delta
battles BS&T, and Phi Kappa
Theta (2-2) meets Born Losers.
BS&T also takes the field tomorrow
when they face AE Pi.

SIGMA DELTA PSI

Pitt alumnus and assistant
track coach Gary Meckley, Ken
Macha, and Normand Roux have
recently been initiated as mem-
bers of Sigma Delta Psi.

Sigma Delta Psi is a national
honorary athletic fraternity which
promotes the total fitness of col-
lege students with emphasis on
physical fitness. There has been
an excess of 140 chapters formed
in colleges, universities, and
junior colleges across the country.

“It’s just a recognition thing
here,” said Leo Bemis, a member
of the board of directors of Sigma
Delta Psi, “but some chapters

have fraternity houses and there

is interfraternity competition.”

To qualify for membership an
individual must meet the require-
ments of fifteen athletic test
items. Applicants are requested
to see coach Bemis, whose office
is in the intramural office at
Trees Hall.

Sigma Delta Psi has been at the
University since 1950, but a for-
mal chapter was never organized.
Bemis expressed desires of a for-
mal chapter so that members may
enter intercollegiate competition.

 

Netters Finish On Consistent
Note: Victory--Only A Dreumiiii

by BILL N AAB

The solution to losing is never an_ easy one. Tennis coach
Ben Pope, who has just concluded a horrible 0-14 season after
another week of losing, realizes that the comeback trail may not be a

smooth ride.

Presently, his two biggest prob-
lems are to convince the best
scholastic high school netters
available to enter the University,
and to encourage the top tennis
prospects already enrolled in
the University to help his squad.

Not even Pope himself really
knows howand if he can achieve
those goals. One thing for sure,
though, _Pope is not criticizing
his players for a lack of’ effort.

“They did the best they could,
but they’re below average tennis
