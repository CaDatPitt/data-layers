Underage drinking ca
norm, not an exception

(Editor’s note: This is the first
of a three-part series on
underage drinking at the
University of Pittsburgh. )

The only thing the bouncer
at Caleco’s wanted from me
that night was a $2 cover
charge. Maybe he didn’t think
I looked underage. Maybe he
didn’t bother carding me
because it was after midnight
and he thought I was like all
the other college students try-
ing to have a good time on a
Thursday night in Oakland.
But I wasn’t.

I was trying to find out how
easy it would be for someone
who was underage to get into
the Oakland bars frequented
by Pitt students.

So walking into Caleco’s on

“No one under 21 admitted  Proper ID required,”
warned the signs at the entrances of the bars where stu-
dents ﬂashed university IDs and walked in. Our night on
the town convinced us that underage drinking is the norm,
not the exception, in Oakland bars.

We went back to the bars later and asked bar owners and
managers about the issue. Some insisted our experience
was the exception. Others said it was unavoidable reality.
Several gave us a cold “no comment.”

“That’s what happens at all the bars in Oakland,” said
the owner of one of the bars that admitted Kevin Kramer

that I was 21.

The Thursday night bar-
crawl experiment was one part
of our investigation of under-
age drinking at Pitt. Our group
also talked to bar owners, stu-

reality was and how the two
related.

I was chosen to get into the
bars because I was the only
member in the group under 21.
Though we contemplated

Tuesday, November 29, 1994

using false identification, we
decided that trying to deceive
the bars would weaken the
results. We set out to hit a
number of bars most popular
with students. When I was
asked for identification, 1 was
to present my University of
Pittsburgh ID, which does not
have a date of birth listed on it.
If this was not accepted, I was
to present my New York state
driver’s license, which clearly
states my birthdate and in
addition has the words “Under
21” in big letters in the right-
hand comer.

We expected limited success,
because we assumed most
underage students got into bars
with fake or borrowed IDs.
Being unfamiliar with the local
bar scene, I was very doubtful
about the driver’s license.

But I found that a university
ID proved to be enough to get
into two of Oakland’s largest
bars, C.J. Barney’s and
Zelda’s, and the “Under 2l”
license got me into The Attic
and Babylon, while as noted I
didn’t need any ID at Caleco’s.

To ensure that the easy
access at C.J.’s and Zelda’s
wasn’t a fluke, members of the
group stood outside these bars

SGB strives for the
shortest meeting ever

By Eric Smith
For The Pitt News

Last night’s Student Government Board meeting
was opened by acting president Ross Pasquale with
a request for brief reports by its members. He was
hoping to beat the record for the shortest SGB
meeting of 17 minutes.

Staccato bursts of garbled language presumably
based on English were put forth by committee and
board members in a valiant attempt to make the
record books. The pace was looking good until an
eager journalism student from the back row inter-

’ rupted the rhythm with a series of apologetic ques-

tions. He was pacified quickly, but not before 21
minutes passed between hand slaps -—— the substi-
tute for gavel blows.

“It was just nice to see everyone getting along
after the elections,” said SGB member Julie
Crowell by way of explanation.

Pasquale explained that the holiday break made
for little SGB activity in the past week.

Highlights included the recent meeting at
Carnegie Mellon University by representatives of
local colleges and universities to discuss computer
censorship. Nothing was decided with finality.

“A lot of the other schools have shown a willing-
ness to follow CMU’s decision to censor,” said
SGB member Todd Neufeld.

He explained Pitt’s need to take a position on the
matter. He felt that the national publicity received
by CMU’s stand demanded that Pitt make a state-
ment or be viewed as “sending pornography out to
all these people under l8.”

LONDON —— In an effort

toward peace, the United.

States has agreed to offer the
Serbs fresh incentives as part
of a new peace push by major
powers, diplomats said
Monday.

The diplomats said the
United States reluctantly
agreed in principle to the
approach at a meeting of offi-
cials from the five—nation
“contact group” in Paris on
Sunday, provided certain con-
ditions were met.

Under the plan, the Bosnian
Serbs would be given the
right to form a confederation
with Serbia which would
divide Bosnia between the
Serbs and the Moslem—Croat
alliance. —Reuters

BONN, Germany — German
computer jock Hartmut
Landwehr has created a pro-
gram called “Online with
Jesus.” Just like a priest, the
computer takes sinners step-
by-step through preliminary
prayers, questions them on
their misdeeds and deals out
their penance.

The only thing the comput-
er can not do is absolve peo-

ple of their sins at the end of »

confession.

A catalog of sins appears
on the screen, some of which
the Vatican probably never

thought of before, including:
“I copied a computer program
without permission.”

At the end of the electronic
confession, the program cal-
culates the si.~nner’s penance
according to points scored for
each sin. —Reuters

MONTREAL — Quebec’s
separatist Parti Quebecois
plans to put the wheels of

Premier Jacques Parizeau is
expected to lay out his gov-
ernment’s strategy for inde-
pendence from Canada during
a speech to the legislature,
called the National Assembly.

The Parti Quebecois has not
talked much about the details
of a separatist referendum or
when it plans to hold the

PORTAGE, Wis. —— Jeffrey
Dahmer, who confessed to
killing 17 young men and
boys in a horrifying 13-year
orgy of dismemberment,
necrophilia and cannibalism,
was slain in prison Monday
as he and another inmate
cleaned a toilet, prison offi-
cials said.

The Columbia Correctional
Institution, where Dahmer
had been a prisoner since
1992, said he died of massive
head injuries while en route

to a hospital.

“At this time there is one
inmate suspected,” a prison
spokesman said. “He was in
that area at the time of the
attack. No one actually saw
the attack  we have not
identified the weapon [but]
the inmate had blood on his
clothes.” —— Reuters

Underage

°From page I
and watched the entrances. They wit-
nessed a continual flow of students who
either used university IDs or no identifi-
cation at all.

After observing this, we spoke to
underage students in these bars about
how they got in and how often they visit-
ed these establishments.

One underage female Pitt student said,
“I know the bouncer here at C.J.’s, and all
I have to do to get in is go up to him and
give him a hug.” (The Pitt News has
agreed to keep the names of underaged
drinkers in this story confidential.)

When I explained to an underage stu-
dent in Zelda’s that I had entered with a
university ID, despite the fact that a uni-
versity police officer was standing at the
door, he said, “When I see a cop at the
door, I’m more confident that I’ll get in.
The cops don’t expect underage people to
challenge them.”

This didn’t turn out to be true at the
Upstage. The state policeman who was at
the door there looked at my license and
informed me that I was underage. I also
was denied entry at Peter’s Pub and the
Decade.

At The Attic, I was denied admittance
with my university ID, but got in with my
license after what seemed to be a miscal-
culation on the part of the bouncer.

The simple subtraction to figureout my
age of 20 proved to be a problem for the
bouncer at Babylon as well. After

attempting to make the calculation for
about a minute, the bouncer said, “You’re
21, right?” Then he apologized for mak-
ing me wait and I was in.

As this pattern persisted through the
night, we began to realize the extent of
underage drinking. In all the bars that
admitted me, I was served without ques-
tion. Once inside, underage drinkers have
free access to alcohol, and the packed
conditions make control practically
impossible. We watched trays of a dozen
or more drinks going back and forth; no
one could keep track of where they were
going or how much any student had
drunk. The drink specials make it easy
and economical to get “blasted” in short
order.

While we focused on the bars close to
Pitt’s campus, the tragic death of Pitt stu-
dent Atif Bhatti is a clear indication that
underage and irresponsible drinking is not
limited to the central Oakland bars.
Though Bhatti died of chronic alcohol
overdose after celebrating his 21st birth-
day at Mitchell’s,.representatives from
the North Oakland bar said they had seen
him at the bar prior to his birthday.
Apparently, he was among the many
underage students who, like me, had no
trouble getting into local bars.

get caught? What usually does happen?

cal consequences for underage drinkers.)

tives of Oakland bars refused to give
their names to The Pitt News writ-
ers.)

But Anthony Tomasic, manager at
The Attic, said, “We make every
effort to card everyone. Underage
students that get in are sometimes
trying to deceive us.” Kevin got into
The Attic with his “Under 21” dri-
ver’s license.

A Caleco’s manager also insisted
that only deception would gain an
underage drinker entry. “If a person
is devious enough, then they will get
in, most of the time by false identifi-
cation,” she said. “We have a strict
carding policy, and there is always
someone at the door.” Kevin walked
into Caleco’s without presenting any
identification whatsoever.

“No system is foolproof,” said a
manager at C.J. Bamey’s who did not
want his name used. “Our policy is to
card everyone.” He repeated that
response word for word when pre-
sented with the details of Kevin’s
admittance to the bar (he got into
with a university ID).

A representative from Zelda’s,

"where Kevin was admitted with his

university ID, had a different ratio-
nale for what happened.

“Is it worse to let underage stu-
dents in, or turn them away and let
those who drive get into cars and

drive to area bars that will let them
in, only to know that they will have
to drive back to Oakland, probably
drunk?” he said. When informed
about the ease that Kevin got in with
a university ID, he didn’t seem sur-
prised. When asked to verify Zelda’s
carding policy, he said, “It’s the same
asevery other bar in Oakland.”

All the bar representatives with
whom we spoke denied that money
played a role in their carding poli-
cies. At least two bars, however,
responded to our investigation indi-
rectly when they called The Pitt
News advertising department asking
about the story and, in one case,
threatening to pull ads if the bar
name was printed in the article.

A number of bar owners pointed
out that no amount of diligence on
their part can prevent a student bent
on drinking from doing so. Students
denied entry at one bar can try other
bars, go to a private party or get a
friend to buy liquor for them.

But many Oakland bars have failed
to be diligent about keeping out
underage patrons, and many appar-
ently have decided that making
money off of students is more impor-

tant than their legal duty. The reality I

we discovered on the night of Oct. 6
is that the Oakland bars do not carry
out the warnings posted at their
doors.

C store change unfair

The university’s new meal plan policy of “blocks” has gotten
mixed reviews from students this semester, but The Pitt News
feels it has generally been a good thing. Blocks have allowed us
more ﬂexibility and the ability to use our meal plans more effi-
ciently. One aspect of this greater flexibility has been the
Lothrop convenience store. By giving students cash equivalency
for their blocks, it has allowed us to supplement our meals and
take food back to our rooms without having to use cash or sneak
it out of the cafeterias.

But unexpectedly and with no warning, Food Services
changed the policy of the Lothrop convenience store. It still
accepts blocks, but now only one per day and for only the cash
equivalency rate of $3.75. (Previously, cash equivalency had
varied from three to five dollars depending on the time of day,
like Schenley Cafe and Eddie’s.) The rationale for this was that
students were using the convenience store as a “wholesale out-
let” rather than merely a supplement to their meals.

The real reasoning behind this is that Food Services had seen
the writing on the wall. A number of students have great excess-
es of blocks and some already began to “raid” the store to use up
their blocks. This new policy will save the university tons of
money and leave students who have not used all their blocks out
in the cold.

We can understand the university’s rationale behind this move,
but it is unfair to the students to do this unannounced and with
only three weeks left in the term. Anyone with half a brain could
have foreseen before the semester started, that students would
start downloading their blocks at the convenience store, and
many purchased on the side of plenty with this in mind. If a pol-
icy change was needed, it should have been properly announced
and implemented next semester when students could change
their meal plans. To implement the policy change now is an
unfair and cheap move.

Hunting season begins

Deer hunting season with rifles started yesterday in
Pennsylvania. Some people object to hunting as a cruel and
inhumane remnant of more uncivilized times. However, regard-
less of whether or not you view the hunting of another creature
for sport to be the act of the civilized or the uncivilized, there is
a logical and very humane rationale for deer hunting.

Deer season is carefully structured so as to keep the deer pop-
ulations in check, but to also regulate hunting so deer popula-
tions are not obliterated. As our nation increases its urban
sprawl and humanity spreads to cover every comer, the natural
ecosystem of deer and other animals is disrupted. If there were
no hunting, then the deer population would surge out of control,
creating problems for us and likely resulting in food shortages
and famine for the deer. We feel it is much more inhumane for
deer to be wiped out in a famine than for a select number to be
shot and then used for food by humans.

Racial tensions threaten political compromise

nthepast
several
weeks

since the
m i d — t e r m
elections took
place there
has already

 

Columnist been much
T911)’ ~* finger point-I
Drckensheets ing from both

the left and
the right over how to interpret
the results. After an initial peri-
od of talk of possible compro-
mise, there are signs that bode
ill for the 104th Congress.
With the Democratic Party
already in disarray following
this historic defeat and many
key members of the GOP hav-
ing already begun their 1996
presidential campaigns, it is
starting to look as if America
will never escape this endless
cycle of political posturing.

In all of the political analysis
that has been forthcoming
since the elections, the most
disturbing has come from those
in the left-wing of the
Democratic Party and the
media. According to those peo-
ple, the election results are an
indication of a racist America
which, led by white males,
banded together to throw the
Democrats out of office in an
attempt to halt the advance-
ment of women and minorities.
This is disturbing because it is
this kind of nonsensical

‘rhetoric which is continuing to

strain race relations in this
country. While there is no
doubt that racism exists in
America today, it cannot be
denied that racism comes in all
colors and is not merely a phe-
nomenon of white males.

The fact is that blacks have
made fantastic progress in
many professions, and the
black middle-class continues to
grow. While we must make an
effort to help those in the inner
cities, the problem will not be

solved by merely making it a
racial issue. The truth is that
throwing money at the problem
will not solve it, teaching self-
reliance will, and that primarily
is the job of the black and
Hispanic leaders. What is dis-
turbing about race relations
today is that many black lead-
ers continue to tell the black
community that they can’t suc-
ceed because of racism. Did
anyone ever stop to think how
black leaders such as Jesse
Jackson and Louis Farrakhan
made it out of poverty? They
made it because they refused to
listen to those who said that
they couldn’t achieve anything
in their lives. It is unfortunate
that they now make their living
by telling blacks the very same
things that they refused to
believe. It is just nonsense to
tell blacks that they have no
role models. If black youths
want a role model, they need
look no further than Gen. Colin
Powell.

For the past three decades
this country has had no leaders,
black, white, Asian or
Hispanic, who have had the
foresight and the guts to make
race relations a centerpiece of
national debate. Until America
faces its racial problems with
truth, not rhetoric, we will
never solve the many social ills
that threaten American civi-
lization. We live in a multi-eth-
nic, heterogeneous society that
has in the past helped to make
the United States the wealthiest
country on earth. We are part
of the greatest racial experi-
ment in history: walk down a

street in any city in America

and one can see people from
all over the world, can hear
hundreds of languages spoken
and experience customs, food
and cultures from all comers of
the globe. This ethnic diversity
should be celebrated, but
instead it is gradually tearing
away at our social fabric.

Liberal “multi—culturalism”
and “political correctness”
must share much of the blame
for this, but all of us share part
of the blame. In the past many
of us have failed to learn about
the cultures of many of our fel-
low citizens, but now the pen-
dulum has swung too far to the
Left. ’

First and foremost our chil-
dren must learn about
American culture and lan-
guage, but at the same time
there is no reason why other
cultural values cannot be incor-
porated into the school curricu-
lum. Americans need to be
more aware of other cultures,
but not at the expense of our
own. Nothing will be accom-
plished by the groupism that is
happening on many of our col-
lege campuses. We must have
a dialogue between the races.
not voluntary segregation.
Single-race organizations such
as the NAACP should admit
members of other races so that
useful discourse and debate
can educate all races about one
another. Affirmative action and
the quota system should be
eliminated. They are not need-
ed and demean minorities and
women, while at the same time
fueling the flames of reverse
discrimination. Get-evenism
will only eventually provoke a
race war.

America has a historic
opportunity to prove that the
world’s peoples can live
together. How we handle racial
tensions ‘will determine
whether America continues to
lead the world or disintegrates
into a nation fragmented along
racial lines. This problem is of
epic proportions. If our leaders
continue to fail to face racial
tensions, our nation will expe-
rience a second civil war that
will surely be much worse than
the first one.

. world of the
Da\_’ld squared circle.
Salrba The absurd, «

windmill, soap
opera-style of prize fights has
dominated the heavyweight
circuit. Since the Tyson era
crumpled in Tokyo at the
hands of James “Buster”
Douglas, we have witnessed a
disgraceful three—year drought
in the most recognized and
prized division.

The title belt that once hung
around the waist of the legend
Muhammad Ali has been
divided into three belts and
has changed waists eight times
since Tyson’s defeat.

The rise of cruiserweight
Evander Holyfield to heavy-
weight contention brought a
glimmer of hope to the fight
faithfuls, although he never
was and never will be a true
heavyweight champion.

What we have come to is an
array of pathetic characters-
beginning with the comeback
of Larry Holmes, Evander
Holyﬁeld, George Foreman
and, most recently, Buster
Douglas. \

The resurgence of George
Foreman as heavyweight
champ is not, as advertised; a
message to the old that they
are to do whatever it is they
think possible. It is a testament
to the disgraceful talent and
greedy promoters who let any-
one fight for a shot at the title.
The knockout of Michael
Moorer was inevitable.
Moorer, whose only distinc-
tion is being the first southpaw
champ, has a cruiserweight
chin and will do everyone a
favor by re-retiring.

When Riddick Bowe defeat-
ed Holyfield for the title, he
discarded one of the three
sanctioned belts, which subse-
quently landed in the hands of
the overrated Lennox Lewis.

Earlier this fall Lewis fell to
Oliver McCall, a worthless
journeyman whose greatest
asset is a mouth that runs for-
ever. Prepare yourself for
Holmes to ﬁght McCall and
win. Sad isn’t it? It only gets
better. Foreman wants to fight
Tyson when he gets released
from his Indianapolis home. In
the meantime, Big George
wants to stay in shape, so look
for the matchup of the elders,
Foreman vs. Holmes.

The Pitt News gurus are back
for our second annual top 25
men ’s basketball preview after
coming oﬁ‘ last year’s impecca-
ble predictions. This is the ﬁrst
of a two-part series.

By Jack Becker
and Sean Duncan
The Pitt News

1.) Arkansas

The Hogs return all five
starters, their whole bench and
even added a couple freshman
prizes to last year’s national
championship squad. History
says it’s tough to repeat, but then
again not every team has the Big
Nasty. Junior power forward
Corliss Williamson, the
Southeastern Conference Player
of the Year and the Final Four
MVP, brings his brute strength
and soft touch down low. The 6-
feet—7-inch VV1lliamson averaged
20.4 points per game and 7.7
rebounds last year.

Shoring up the forward posi-
tion is the 6-6 silky clutch shoot-
er Scotty Thurman. Thurman,
who averaged 15.9 points, adds
the finesse to the best forward
combination in the country.

A trio of centers will assume
the middle-key responsibilities.
Sophomores Darnell Robinson
and Lee Wilson are very athletic
and should deﬁnitely improve on
their mediocre freshmen sea-
sons. Porky Dwight Stewart
adds another dimension to
Arkansas’ frontcourt. He can
shoot the three while clogging
the middle on defense.

Coach Nolan Richardson’s
hectic pressing defense is spear-
headed by defensive gems Corey
Beck and Clint McDaniel.
Neither one of them are profi-
cient shooters, but that’s OK,
because Richardson has Alex

. Dillard, whose range starts when

he walks in the gym.

2.) Massachusetts

Anyone who saw UMass
blitzkrieg No. 1 Arkansas last
week would have to be in awe of
the Minutemen’s talent. Coach
John Calipari is already calling
his team the 1994-95 champions.
That might not be an overstate-
ment.

UMass has as much depth as
anyone in the country. Calipari
could start any combination of
10 players and hardly miss a
beat. The Minutemen excel in
relentless basketball, and sprout-
ing from that style is All-
American power forward Lou
Roe, who had a career night
against Arkansas’ Williamson.
Backing Roe is rail-thin center
Marcus Camby, who averaged
3.6 blocks per game. Junior
Donta Bright (Baltimore
Dunbar) provides explosion
from the wing, and king of the
buzzer—beater Mike Williams
lends the pop from the arc. Solid
point man Derek Kellogg gets
the ball to the right guys.

However, the bench puts
UMass over the top. Dana
Dingle, Edgar Padilla and

Carmelo Travieso would all start
on most college teams, and
freshman Inus Norville already
shows spunk as Camby’s back-
up.

If Calipari is ever to land a
Final Four spot, this is the year.

3.)North Carolina

The core of the team that won
the ‘93 national championship is
gone, but two holdovers linger
with a trio of unlimited young-
sters. Senior Pat Sullivan returns
from a redshirt to issue the glue
missing from last season.
Sullivan’s headﬁrst brand of play
mixes with dead—eye senior
shooter Donald Williams to form

happened yet. This season
should be the 6-7 jur1ior’s com-
ing-out party. Along with
Rhodes, guard Tony Delk, the
‘Cats returning leading scorer,
will carry the offensive responsi-
bilities.

Kentucky’s depth starts in the
frontcourt. Pitino returns Jared
Prickett, Andre Riddick and
Walter McCarty, who were all
major cogs from last year’s
squad. Add Washington transfer
Mark Pope and Chicago blue-
chipper Antoine Walker to the
mix, and Pitino will once again
have a winner for the bluegrass
ﬁelds.

Pitt News File Phto

Lawrence Moten leads the Big East's top-ranked team, Syracuse.

the experienced ‘93 holdovers.
Rasheed Wallace, Jerry
Stackhouse and Jeff Mclnnis
form the loaded trio. Wallace
was mentioned as a top 10 selec-
tion in last year’s NBA draft as a
freshman. Look for him to be the
ACC Player of the Year.
Stackhouse can score, pass,
rebound and jump. Boy can he
jump. Mclnnis had a year of
tutelage under Derrick Phelps at
the point and will score more
frequently.

Blackhawk’s Dante Calabria
leads an untested bench. N.C.
needs 7-2 Serge Zwikker to
work into the rotation behind
Wallace. This team doesn’t share
the ball enough to copy the
accomplishments of the ‘93
squad.

4.) Kentucky

Each year the Wildcats lose
key players, but each year
they’re at the top of the polls.
That’s because they’re always
one of the deepest teams in the
country, and this year is no dif-
ferent. Born winner Rick Pitino
can comfortably go 10 deep on
his bench.

Two years ago, college basket-
ball analyst Billy Packer said
that Rodrick Rhodes would
make everybody forget about
Jamal Mashbum — that hasn’t

5.) UCLA

It’s tough to play in Pauley
Pavilion and lose in the NCAA
first round with a team once
ranked No. 1. Coach Jim
Harrick’s head could be on the
block if this year’s team isn’t up
to enormous expectations. At
least he’s got the talent to give it
a go.

The O’Bannon boys, Ed and
Charlie, are together for their
finale. Ed is bidding for All-
American honors, while Charlie
dusts off his Rookie of the Year
awards. They combine to form
the axis of the team that shifty
point guard Tyus Edney revolves
around. Edney is among the top
five lead guards in the country.
George Zidek provides meat in
the middle.

Finally, this team has some
depth, which could be the miss-
ing ingredient. Harrick landed a
top freshman class, led by
omm’A Givins and J.R.
Henderson. Marquis Burns and
Toby Bailey also ﬁgure into the
mix.

6.) Duke

Grant Hill has passed the
Devil’s torch of excellence to the
Chief — Cherokee Parks. He’s
not pretty to watch or look at,
but he gets the job done inside
and outside. His 14.4 points per

game and 8.4 rebounds will go
up considerably this year.

They’re not the most talented
team, but Coach K always seems
to win with mirrors — and good
recruiting. Coach K will have to
rely on the talents of his three
top recruits. Six-foot-6-inch
leaper Ricky Price heads the
freshman class, along with Mr.
Alaska Trajan Langdon and little
point guard Steve
Wojciechowski.

With shooter Chris Collins on
the rack with a broken foot,
sophomore point guard Jeff
Capel is the only other returning
starter. Duke has an abundance
of big bodies on the bench,
which could equal another.Final
Four birth.

7.) Kansas
Kansas lost a class that went to
two Final Fours, but returns a

host of players waiting to star.

Jacque Vaughn dips and drives
and dishes the tempo for the
Jayhawks and will be free to
roam this year. Vaughn’s top tar-
get aims to be Cal transfer Jerod
Haase, who could upgrade the
two spot. Greg Ostertag mans
the middle with top recruit Raef
LaFrentz pushing for his playing
time.

The Big Eight’s best trey
shooter Greg Gurley might be
relegated to a sixth man role
again, while Sean Pearson and
Scot Pollard are bound to
expand their production without
departed Patrick Richey and
Richard Scott around.

The Big Eight title is the
J ayhawks’ to lose.

8.) Maryland

The Terps rode their young
talent all the way to the Sweet 16
last season, and with a year of
maturing, they may go further.
Led by the 6-10 sophomore sen-
sation Joe Smith, who scored
19.4 a game, Marland returns all
five starters. Smith is the next
best thing to come to Maryland
since the late Len Bias and crab-
cakes.

Juniors Johnny Rhodes and
Duane Simpkins have quietly
become the best backcourt in the
ACC. Sophomore forward Keith
Booth is the heart of Maryland’s
attack. Exree Hipp, a 6-8 athletic
forward, rounds off the starting
five who all averaged over 10
points per game last year.

9.) Virginia

The best thing to happen to
this year’s Virginia team is that
Corey Alexander was lost to
injury a year ago. That led to the

blossoming of freshman Harold '

Deane. Alexander is back to
reclaim his point guard spot,
shifting Deane over to two-
guard. The All-ACC caliber
backcourt is backed by high
school All-American Curtis
Staples.

The Cavaliers lack a center in
the conference of big men, but
what they do have is a host of 6-
8 leapers who crash the glass.

Hoops

‘From page 9
Underrated forward Junior
Burrough, who locates ‘bounds
in a forest of 7-footers, heads the
brigade. Joining him are Yuri
Barnes, Chris Alexander and
freshman Norman Nolan
(Baltimore Dunbar). Virginia
could ﬁnish as low as fourth in
the ACC and still go deep in the
NCAA Tourney.

10.) Indiana

The weight of the university
rests on the frame of 6-9 senior
Alan Henderson. His nemesis,
Glenn Robinson, is ﬁnally out of
Henderson’s life, for now. He
was dominated by Robinson
since high school, and now
Henderson can finally get the
props he deserves. Three-point
shooter Brian Evans, who played
most of last season with a dislo-
cated shoulder, will solidify the
forward slot. Gawky 7—foot Todd

Lindeman will be in the middle.
Bobby Knight hit the jackpot
in the recruiting races this year.
He landed 6-8 forward Andrae
Patterson, who was rated as a
top-ﬁve recruit, and 6-7 Charlie
Miller. Both will get substantial
playing time for the Hoosiers.

should be no different. Loaded
with talent, Lute Olsen and his
choking desert ‘Cats have terrif-
ic promise, but will wilt under
the pressure.

No one can match point guard
Damon Stoudamire’s quickness
except rival UCLA guard Edney.
Perhaps the best at his position,
Stoudamire will have score more
after the departure of Khalid
Reeves to the NBA. Defensive
whiz Reggie Geaty gets in oppo-
nents’ faces and talks piles of
garbage. Ray Owes and Joseph
Blair are both proﬁcient scorers
and solid rebounders.

12.) Syracuse

Syracuse has all the pieces of
the classic Jim Boeheirn team.
Senior Big East Player of the
Year candidate and baseline pro-
fessor Lawrence Moten is joined
in the backcourt by juco sensa-
tion and former Arkansas recruit
Michael Lloyd. Lloyd may
enjoy his jumper slightly more
than his no—looks, but he’ll be
running the point by default.

Forward John Wallace is

bulging with, as yet unused tal-
ent. Wallace may not be Derrick
Coleman quality now, but he’s
getting there. Lucious Jackson
wants to prove he can produce,
but is surrounded by guys who
will force him into a support
role. Otis Hill never saw a two-
foot shot he didn’t like because
he never saw a ten-footer he
could hit. Still, Hill does what’s
asked of him — rebound and
bang.

Syracuse is the Big East’s best
bet.

13.) Florida

The Gators might be a little
overrated this year, but we’ll
give a Final Four squad the ben-
efit of doubt.

Gone is shooter Craig Brown,
with no replacement in sight.
Jason Anderson will take over
Brown’s spot, but that also cre-
ates a small depth problem for
Lon Kruger. All-SEC choice
Dan Cross teams with master of
the screaming dunk Andrew
DeClercq and “DaMeat Hook”

But what about Bowe, and
Moorer? Bowe is lost in the
life of being Ali, and Moorer
typifies the standard fighter
that Douglas has made popu-
lar. It may take more than a
dominating Tyson to bring
prestige and honor back to the
silly, WWF-like world of the
heavyweight division.

Until then, look to the small-
er guys, the middleweights and
lightweights. There’s heart,
desire and most importantly
fighters like Roy Jones Jr.,
James Toney, Sweet Pea
Whitaker and Julio Cesar
Chavez. The talent is there and
so are the fights. There may
not be the toe—to-toe brawling
or mass banging mass, but
there is action and the attrac-
tion of the top fighters in the
world.

Fortson teams with 6-10
juco boy Arthur Long to give
the Bearcats a formidable front
line. Curtis “Karate” Bostic

brings his .05 percent body fat
frame into the fold for senior
leadership, and 6-2 LaZelle
Durden adds the crazy rainbow
jumpers.

Louisville transfer Keith
LeGree starts at the point imme-
diately, bumping 6-5 Damon
Flint two spots over to small for-
ward. Guard Darnell Burton
heats up a long and experienced
Cincy bench.

If things roll right, the
Bearcats could wind up a top
five team.

15.) Michigan

Don’t let anyone fool you.
This Michigan recruiting class is
no Fab Five. It’s more like Fab
One with the Very Good Four.

The Fab One is 6-9 swing
man Jerod Ward. Ward enters
the starting unit from the first
game. He’l1 add scoring to Fab
Five leftovers Ray Jackson and
Jimmy King. Center Makhtar
Ndiaye and point guard Dugan
Fife round out the starters.

The difference with this
Wolverine team is that they’ll
play with unlimited substitution.
Sophomores Olivier Saint-Jean
and Bobby Crawford will
demand playing time, as will the
remaining four freshmen.

Again, coach Steve Fisher
merely has to turn the troops

16.) UConn

Donyell Marshall is gone, but
the supporting cast of the Big
East champions is still in tact.

UConn possesses the two top
sophomores in the Big East.
Israeli combo-guard Doron
Sheffer, who was the Big East
Rookie of the Year, has great
court vision and a deadly shoot-
ing eye. Sophomore swingman
Ray Allen will now be the
Huskies’ go—to man. As a fresh-
man he averaged l2.6 points,
and with Marshall’s void,
Allen’s contributions will be
much greater.

At only 6-6, Donny Marshall,
(not to be confused with
Donyell) with his pugnacious
play, serves as UConn’s
enforcer. To go along with
Donny are beefy Eric Hayward

loose to rack up the wins. and 7—foot Travis Knight.
