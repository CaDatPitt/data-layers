Pitt Again Eyes Carlow
To Ease Dorm Crowd

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staffwriter

To allieviate the fall housing crunch, several female students may
again be sent to the dormitories of Carlow College. ‘

Approximately 400 Pitt students were shut out of the residence halls
when a 2,300 upperclassmen limit was met in February.

Carlow, located about a half mile down Fifth Avenue from the Towers,
is a Catholic, all-female school which has accepted Pitt overﬂows for the
past several years. Due to the loss of Webster Hall as analternative
housing source, Carlow may be asked to serve more students than in
years past.

Form lett_ers were mailed to Pitt students last Week to poll their
reactions toward residing at Carlow’s dorms, asking for an over-all
opinion of living at Carlow and for a decision if University housing can
not be provided by mid-July.

Pitt students would have the option of usirr g either Pitt or Carlow meal
plans, but dormitory regulations between the two schools vary.

For example, Carlow students are not permitted to entertain male
guests in their rooms after 8 p.m. Also, Carlow dorms function with
24-hour security, as do Pitt’s quad dorms.

In the past, Carlow has usually been regarded as a temporary
arrangement with students moving to the Pitt campus as soon as a room
becomes available. This _year’s form letter states that “it is necessary
that a student realizes that an assignment at Carlow College is basically
for two terms and the rules and regulations of that school regarding the
residence halls must be followed.”

Housing rates at Carlow are somewhat higher than Pitt’s rooming

Bv JOHN MAGER

The Indian Government recently
placed an embargo on the-
export of rhesus monkeys used
extensively in the United States.
This ban will have a direct effect on
research being conducted which
uses the animals, ~and has
prompted efforts by American
scientists, including some at the
University of Pittsburgh, to deve-
lop domestic sources of rhesus
monkeys.

Federal health authorities asked
researchers ’ to suspend experi-
ments requiring rhesus monkeys to
die to insure an adequate supply
for the testing of vaccines.

And alternative source of mon-
keys is immediately available in
Bangladesh. However, they are
much more scarce there than in
India, and could be extinguished in
a few years, some experts say.

Monkeys can be bred in
captivity; however, there are only a
half-dozen or so breeding stations
in the United States, producing

American

house female students at Carlow College, about a half-

U.S. Researchers Face Monkey Shortage

roughly 10 percent of current
needs.

One such station is being
constructed at the Primate Re-
search Lab of the University of
Pittsburgh, under the direction of
Dr. Ernst Knobil, the Chairman of
the Physiology Department of the
School of Medicine. Monkeys are
used at the facility, located in Plum
Boro, for research mainly in the
physiology of reproduction.

The breeding station will be
ready for occupancy in June,
according to Dr. Knobil. Three
years ago, the plans were drawn up
for the facility, which will enable
the research operation to be
self-sufﬁcient in the supply of
rhesus monkeys.

“We are anticipating the short-
age, but we~didn’t expect it to come

so soon,” Knobil said. “We must.

ﬁnd a breeding stock, which could
be hard to obtain, and the money to
pay for the monkeys and for the
personnel to staff the facility.”
According to Knobil, the present

supply at the lab will last about one

year.. -

“If things go as planned, we
could be completely self-sufﬁcient

in ﬁve years. At that timefwe could '

even expand further, enabling us to
supply other researchers by selling
monkeys at cost,” he said.

In the meanwhile, supplies must
be counted on to come mainly from
Bangladesh. .

Last year, American. scientist
used about 12,000 rhesus monkeys,
nearly all of them imported from
India. About half of them were
used in federally required vaccine
tests that must be done, as
mandated by law, if the vaccines
are to be available.

The other half were used mostly
in biomedical research projects of
various kinds. The rhesus is
favored by researchers because, as
a primate, it is more similar to_
humans than many other animals.
Also, decades of research using the
monkey have resulted in the
accumulation ofmuch data on its

behavior, chemistry and physiology
that make it more suitable to
experimentation because new stu-
dies can be -more sophisticated and
results interpreted with more
sensitivity and confidence.

All the monkeys purchased from
so under a
22-year-old agreement between
India and the United States that
states the monkeys are to be used
solely for biomedical research.
However, according to the Interna-
tional Primate Protection League,
monkeys were used in a number of
military and otherwise inhumane
experiments that included testing
the effects on the monkeys of:
radiation in the development of the
neutron bomb; burns; gunshot
wounds; severe shock; physiologi-
cal psychology, and accidents.

These abused of the agreement
were brought to the attention of

Indian Prime Minister Morarji
Desai who ordered a ban on the

export of all rhesus monkeys from .

India effective April 1, 1978.

‘Rabbits’ Begin Production Today

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH——Volkswagen, which
brought its funny-looking little car to
America when the U.S. automakers’ motto
was “Think Big,” begins U.S. production
today after a construction blitz that turned a

mere shell into a working auto plant in less '

than year.
_ The first of Volkswagen's U.S.-produced
Rabbit models is scheduled to roll off the
assembly line at the nearly complete New
Stanton plant 35 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh.

“We have everything in place to build
cars,” said plant public relations director Chet
Bahn. “The cafeterias aren’t yet complete and
the administration building still needs
partitions and carpeting, but I’ve already seen
a great many car bodies built and painted.”

Some 1,200 employees have been riveting,
welding and stocking parts at the Westmor-

land County facility for weeks. Just the final
part of the ﬁrst U.S.-produced Rabbit remains
to be installed, and the car is expected to be
sent to the Volkswagen museum in

‘Wolfsburg, Germany. _
The remaining 200,000 cars Volkswagen

will produce here annually will go to dealer
showrooms, however, as part of the German
ﬁrm’s push against challenges from Japanese
and U.S. small cars.‘

The company did not locate here by
accident. There was competition for the plant
by several areas hoping to bolster sagging
local economies in once-busy industrial areas.

The multimillion-dollar loan and tax
abatement plan that got Volkswagen here was
a complex arrangement involving the state,
the county, the Chrysler Corp., two townships
and two school districts.

_Some 4,500 persons are expected to work at

the plant when it reaches full production and

- the annual payroll is estimated at $97 million.

About 90 percent of the jobs are to be ﬁlled by
persons living in a 35-mile radius of the plant,
and back—up development includes the paving
of 1,000 miles of secondary roads in 17
counties. '

As for Volkswagen. it hopes the plant’s «
production will help return the company to a
dominant position in the American market-
place.

Volkswagen’s Beetle, which engendered
jokes as well as sales when it was ﬁrst
introduced in America, made the company the

' leading importer of cars in the United States

for many years.

Recently. however, the U.S. dollar has
grown weaker in relation to the German mark,
cutting Volkswagen's former price edge amid
increased competition.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

  Lowering Standards

College of Arts and Sciences Council’s rejection of the biology
department’s proposal to cut core biology laboratory classes
required in freshman and sophomore years affirms that the
primary goal of the University is to produce well-educated

graduates.

To release teaching assistants from teaching and allow them
more time for research, the biology department planned to merge
freshman and sophomore biology labs, thereby cutting the lab

requirement for majors.

In its haste to find a way to increase research capabilities, the
biology department forgot to consider the needs of un-
dergraduates. Laboratory courses add'meaning to the dry facts
students are innundated with during lectures, and without them

application.

I students are supplied with theories that are never given practical

The danger of emphasizing lecture courses over lab study is ap-
parent. Giving biology students lectures without labs is like
teaching a person to drive by lecturing him on traffic laws and
safety without giving him any practical experience behind the wheel
of a car. The student driver may become a theoritician on driving,
but he certainly cannot be well—prepared to drive on the public

highways.

Biology department chairman David Sussman’s arguments for
the proposal, that no other school he knows requires more than
three core sequence hours in lab work, causes one to wonder what
he believes Pitt’s academic standard should be——excellence or
mediocrity. Because other schools require only three hours does not
mean Pitt should stoop to the same level.

Instead of attempting to find the easiest possible method to in-
crease biology research, and then rationalizing that method by
arguing, in effect, that everybody else does it, the department
should give a little more thought to its problem. Seriously attempt-
ing" to recruit more graduate students who can serve as teaching
assistants could be one alternative benefitting undergraduate
students and increasing the biology department’s research. ’

K reskin Fiasco Fault of Programming

I am writing in regard to the
ﬁasco at the Kreskin program
recently. Many students wishing
to see the program were forced by
the campus police to leave the
program because they'were not
seated. The reason given for their
expulsion was that it was stated in
Kreskin’s contract that everyone
must be seated.

If this was the case then there

By GARY GOVERT

‘.‘Rollergirls,” “California
Girls,” and better yet, “Wayward
Girls.”Big “girls,” I understand.
Plots woven around a parade of
wobbly T-shirts. I

The list goes on. Already
established TV porn will return‘ for
another season of sexual objectiﬁ-

. cation and artistic drought. Script-

writers for “Charlie’s Angels” will
grind out increasingly banal
storylines and dialogue; after all,
how many creative swimsuit scenes
can there be?

The men (and women) responsi-
ble for these programs deny any
pecuniary or mercenary approach to
what they do. according to reporter
Lindsey. Instead, they claim that
such gems as “Coed Fever" and
“Rollergirls" merely reflect chang-
ing sexual-values. '

But the fact is that TV has been
taking a beating lately. According to

u _ . ‘,2  I.

'~.‘;.é.a— L» .‘ xv . ...-a'u,x.o‘u-—
as - ». , . _

polls, there has recently been a
three to ﬁve percent drop in
nighttime viewers. Yet those
programs dealing in sexual innuen-
do and tightly packed two-pieces
are among the rating leaders. Could
it be that the networks are rather
desperately turning to titillation in
an -attempt to beef up audience
shares?

Ithink so. In their mad pursuit of

g the almighty advertising buck, the

networks seem only too willing to
turn the airwaves over to jiggling
breasts and junior-high level
comedy. In the process, a
one-dimensional view of women
(and men, for that matter) is both
exploited and perpetuated. The
female anatomy is treated as
something quite removed from a

woman ’s dignity and personal
integrity. and sex becomes a
playth1ng———a sort of immature

fascination rather than the sacred
trust of one’s humanity.

‘This casually exploitative ap-
proach to sexuality cannot help but
ﬁnd its way into the ‘developing
attitudes of young viewers, nor can
it leave the relational lives of adults

unscathed. Television is a powerful I

value-shaper in our culture. and the

no bounces at all. Where is the ball?
Reinforcing steel mesh shows in
some worn parts and cracks travel
throughout the courts. And what
about center straps? Those things
that hold the net down in the middle
found on all decent courts.

Well if we do build some new
courts where do we put them?
Bubble’s Field would be nice, next
to the Frick Fine Arts Building. And
who from the University uses that?
A bonﬁre once a year. This
setting could be so much more
pleasant and accessible. Students
could walk there in ﬁve minutes
rather than hiking for 15-20 minutes
up the hill to Trees courts.

Wouldn't you like to be able to
see some ﬁne tennis? Or play a nice,
true-bouncing uninterrupted game
of your own.’ Don’t you deserve it?
C-MU, Duquesne (with three new
courts), Robert Morris, Indiana

name a few, all have that privilege.

Cousins writes:

“In recent years, sleaziness has.

be competition, especially in

competition is the strange notion
that intimacy doesn’t require

notion that neither has anything to

Gelsey Kirkland Brings Classic

By PAT LAWS and
SALLY RAPPEPORT
Pitt News Staff Writers

Stars from American Ballet
I'heatre—who do they attract?-
not audiences apparently. Bringing
big names from famous New York
ballet companies appears to be the
latest gimmick to encourage
support for the arts in smaller cities
where the large companies don't
perform. v

The half-empty house at Heinz
Hall Tuesday and Wednesday
night indicated, however, that
Pittsburghers were not fooled. The
dancing by the stars was good, in
some pieces exquisite, but the
excerpts from ballets, the under-
rehearsed corps de ballet and the
poorly taped music, overshadowed
their performance.

‘Gelsey Kirkland. one of
America’s outstanding ballerinas,
could have danced all night. Her
unique style and perfect technique,
made her seem like a beautiful,
almost inhuman creature.

She opened Wednesday
evening’s program dancing with
Ivan Nagy, known for his excellent
partnering abilities, in a pas de
deux from the ballet “Concerto.”

Because of its contemporary
nature, this piece was the most
enjoyable of the evening. Since the
entire ballet-is not dependent on a
storyline, this pas de deux
performed alone could. be appre-
ciated as pure dance.

Kirkland’s dancing in Act II of
“Giselle” was incredible, but the
piece in itself was disappointing.
To do justice to great classics like
“Giselle," it is necssary to perform
the full-length version with an
orchestra and a large corps de
ballet. Otherwise the corps seems

out of place and the dynamics of
the ballet are lost. In this
performance of “Giselle,” the
boring choreography of the corps
was distracting and it detracted
from the performance of Kirkland
and Nagy.

Variations from “La Bayadere”
featured two other ballet stars,
Marianne Tchrtkassky and Peter
Schaufuss. The choreography lent
itself to showing off technique that
the dancers, especially Schaufuss,
did very well. Enchanting the
audience, he ﬂashed across the

stage leaping through fantastic
beats and turns. The piece Was
ruined, however, by an extremely
poor recording, which Was

chopped up horribly, leaving
lengthy gaps between the varia-
tions. Also, an extra variation for
three other dancers was stuck into

. the ballet for no apparent reason.

In the last piece on Wednesday’s
program, “Le Corsaire” pas de
deux was replaced by the pas de
deux from “Flower Festival In
Genzano.” This pas de deux
follows the traditional style of the

Danish choreographer August
Bournonville. Peter Schaufuss,
trained from childhood in the
Danish technique, and Marianne
Tcherkassky, with her dramatic
ability, were ideal in this romantic
ballet.

The stars from American Ballet
Theater are well deserving of their
reputation as fine dancers; hope-
fully if they return to Pittsburgh,
they will choose to perform more
pieces like “Concerto” instead of
destroying the traditional classical
ballets bv chopping them up. _

Clapton '5 Got Anything But a 'Slowhand'

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Eric Clapton
Slowhand
RSO

For the man with the reputation
of rock’,s best guitarist, Eric Clapton
is no underachiever or “Slow-
hand.” Clapton offers an enjoyable
disc of blues with a little country
ﬂavor.

Neither Clapton’s guitar nor his

voice need any introduction, but the‘

other musicians are just as
important to the music. Marcy Levy
and Yvonne Elliman provide good
backup and lead vocals, while Dick
Sims’s keyboards enrich the music.
In addition, Clapton’s guitar work is
greatly augmented by George
Terry. The “other guitarist” proves
to be talented, and his work is a
complement to Clapton .

"Stalking the Perfect
Tan" in Doonesbury

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

No,-it’-s not a reincarnated Euell Gibbons—“Doonesbury” comic
strip’s resident freak, Zonker Harris, is the man stalking the perfect tan.
Despondent over pal Joanie Caucus’s imminent graduation from law
school (Zonker himself spent three years as a sophomore to stall
graduation), Zonker isn’t even excited to see Uncle Duke (the Hunter
Thompson take-off) when Duke is dumped as the United States envoy to

Uncle Duke isn’t alone in his search for employment: USC grad
Caucus iﬁnds employment with her old'—political adversary Lacey
Davenport, while her main man, ace reporter Rick Redfern, has to make
do penning the “Chatter” section of “People” magazine. Mark
Slackmeyer is back tending bar at college reunions, and while Clyde
stays on the welfare rolls, he’s spending his spare time tracing his roots.

Garry Trudeau gets in some sly digs at Washington with the first
annual Human Rights Banquet and Henry Kissinger’s teaching a
seminar at Georgetown. Redfern’s prepping at “People’s Media
Clinic,” replete with lectures from Liz Smith on ethics in journalism is a
well-placed jab at the gossip mongers, and the liberties taken with the
Chinese translation of Uncle Duke’s speech helps make a very funny

Trudeau provides some warm moments as well—That long-awaited »
graduation from law school may chalk up some points for runaway wives
everywhere and the birth of a son to rock superstar Jimmy Thudpucker is

Trudeau has expanded his characters far beyond that insular world of ‘
Yale where the strip originatedrnine years ago. And, unlike most
cartoonists (like Charles Shultz and Johnny Hart), Trudeau has created
an atmosphere in which his characters can grow and develop. .

“Stalking the Perfect Tan” is Trudeau’s thirteenth book, but it’s
deﬁnitely not unlucky—for author or readers-.

 

pulled between her sensual, secular
needs—represented by her affair
with a married man—and the moral
certainy of her self-sacriﬁcing past.

The brisk and witty writing of
Mary Gordon’s first novel offsets its
serious topic. The ironic details of
Isabel’s upbringing (‘ ‘the stories...
like the woman who secretly spat
the Host into her purse and took it
home to jab it with a pencil...This
depraved soul had been found
mysteriously dead the next morning
with a circle of black dots around her
heart”) and the funny, sharp
Catholic school dialogue between
Isabel and her two old friends, Liz
and Eleanor, portray the ﬂip side of
her dilemma of self and soul.

Isabel’s relationship with her
demanding, scholarly father, a
mixture of Electra complex, resent-
ment and affection, is also deftly
handled, and serves as a counter-
weight to her relationships with
other men. These include an
alcoholic priest, the blatantly sexual
husband of her friend Liz and her
veterinarian lover, Hugh.

“There’s no one who loves me
enough,” says a suicidal woman
whom Isabel visits as part of her job
investigating the lives of the
elderly. This complaint, with its
overtones of fear and loss, runs
through “Final Payments.” Isabel
attempts to escape the overwhelm-
ing challenges of love by adminis-
tering guilty ‘ ‘payments’ ’ of charity
to the person she hates—her
father’s bitterly pious ex-house-
keeper. She tries to avoid the
difficult choices of modern life by
returning to the ritual of the
Church.

At the end of this ambitiously
philosophical novel, however, Isa-
bel’s sense of sin and responsibility
shifts 'to a strange, yet exhilirating,
faith in herself.

The first offering is the heavy-
sounding “Cocaine,” highlighted
by Clapton’s guitar moving hand in
hand with the heavy beat.

“Wonderful Tonight” follows as
a pretty ballad. Clapton’s soft,
gentle vocals shine here, and Dick
Sims’s keyboards produce a sound
that is rich and at the same time
light.

Quick, tight chugging on the
guitars characterize “Lay Down
Sally,” which has been released as
a single. In addition, Carl Radle’s
lively bass moves the song along.
Some nice keyboard work and sweet
guitar picking are exhibited in
“Next Time You See Her.”

The best cut on the album, “The
Core,” opens side two. There is a
smooth, ﬂowing interchange of
vocals, accompanied by the absor-
bing sounds of the keyboards. The
hard and heavy guitar jamming

comes alive courtesey of Clapton
and Terry, and at the climax, Mel
Collin’s fresh, lively saxophone
breaks through and commands the
listener’s attention.

The following song. “May You
Never,” continues in the same vein
as “Wonderful Tonight’ ’ and ‘ ‘Next
Time You See Her.”

“Slowhand” ﬁnishes strongly
with “Mean Old Frisco” and
“Peaches and Diesel.” The former
cut is strong and bluesy. The heavy
guitar accompanies Clapton’s deep,
drawn-out vocals nicely. In con-
trast, “Peaches and Diesel” comes
through as a pretty instrumental
piece. The easy beat rolls on while
Sims’s ‘keyboards elevate and
Clapton’s guitar‘ sweetens. “Slow-
hand” is good work from the great
guitarist who, incidentally, is
coming to Pittsburgh later this
month.

Panther Frank Bucci Realizes Professional Soccer Dream

7 By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Not long ago,  soccer goalie
Frank Bucci had the dreamof many

athletes--to become a professional 

in his ﬁeld. Bucci’s dream came
true this week as he came a
member of the Connecticut’Yan-
kees of ' the American Soccer
League.

“This has got to be‘ about the
best thing that has ever happened
to me,” said Bucci. “I always
thought about being able to play
pro ball, and, now I'm going to, it
feels great.”

Bucci was requested to tryout for
the ‘team «in Stanford, Conn. April

 

PORTS

1. Bucci’s ﬁne performance earned
him his "ticket to the pros.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis sees
Bucci’s feat as being an outstand-
ing accomplishment for Bucci,
himself, and Pitt soccer.

“I see this as a great opportunity
for Frank,” Bemis said. “If he can
show his talents and give a good
account of himself, he will make a
ﬁne professional goalie. There is no

question of his courage and desire
to make it in the pros.” '
In previous years, Pitt has sent
ﬁve players to professional soccer’s
Pittsburgh Miners. One player,
Joe Luxbacher, also played for the
now-defunct Philadelphia -Atorns.

Approximately 150 athletes-

tried-out for the Yankees, with
Bucci and six others competing for
goalie. Of these six, one was the

Jamaican National Team goalie
and another played for the Italian
World Cup team.

Bucci leaves Thursday for a
four-week training camp prior to
the season opener April 30. Bucci
realizes that being a professional is
a big step in his life.

“I know when I get to
Connecticut it will be a" whole new

ball game_ and l’ll be playing with g

and competing against some of the _  77-‘

best soccer players in the nation.”

he said. “This -is something that

I’ve always wanted to experience.

- I’ve now been given this Chance

that has made my dream in life
come true.”

Quay Shaves Opponents After Bagging

ByJIMPANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Give Kevin Quay a pack of razor
blades and he would “bag ’em,”
just as he has been doing to his
court opponents of late.

Quay, Pitt's tennis co-captain,
has been clean shaven during only
two matches this season and,
coincidentally, has lost only twice
in singles action.

“I went down to Virginia and
said, ‘bag the razors,’ ” Quay said
of the Panthers’ season-opening
tour in which he lost only once. “I
played pretty well down there.
When Icame home, I shaved and

. lost to California.”

Quay hasn't shaved since and,
superstition or no, he has won four
straight singles matches, including
three over the weekend.

“The -‘beard makes me look
mean,” he quipped. I _

Instrumental in the Panthers’ 7-2
win over host Akron Saturday and a

_9-0 Trees Courts victory over

hapless Robert Morris yesterday,
Quay provided the only bright spot
in Friday’s 8-1 loss to powerhouse
Penn State. The loss was Pitt's ﬁrst
Trees Courts defeat in two years.

“That’s the ﬁrst time in 15 years
we haven’t been shut out by Penn

For the sophomore from
Lafayette Hill, Pa., it took more
than his “Clint (Eastwood) look” to
chalk up a 6-3, 6-4 decision over the
Lions’ Alex Davidson at the
number-three singles slot.

“It was the best I’ve served in a

long time,” he said. “We came up

and practiced for four hours before
the match today.”

Quay’s effort came as consola-
tion to the Panthers, who have
annually been humiliated by Penn
State teams.

“It felt good to win my match,”
Quay said. “But I’ll tell you, the
team didn’t feel outclassed this
year. Last year we did. This is the
ﬁrst season everyone on the team
has been putting out; we feel much
more conﬁdent this year.”

That conﬁdence has led to a 7-3
record, leaving Pitt one away from
equalling last season's 8-12 mark.

The Panthers rebounded from
Penn State’s devastation by travel-
ing to Ohio Saturday and zipping
past Akron. Pitt had a 6-0 lead after
singles play, and two doubles
losses were meaningless; the
Panthers returned home with a 7-2

I victory, improving on last year’s

5-4 margin over the Zips.

“Akron lost a couple of guys
from last year,” Dieffenbach said.
“Their number-three singles
player was playing number one this
year. But our attitude made a big
difference this year. We have a
confident team.” ‘

Once home, Pitt mirrored its 9-0
win of a week ago over Robert
Morris ‘by beating those same
Colonials by the same score
yesterday.

Though sticking with the same
singles lineup he has used
throughout 1 the season,
Dieffenbach gave some of his
less-experienced players a chance
at some doubles play. ‘

Gallagher, Brechbill Dueling for Starting Spot

ByKARENKADlLAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

When the Pitt football team opened
spring practice last month, Ed Gallagher
and Kurt Brechbill split ﬁrst-team duties at
offensive left tackle, and when daily
work-outs ended Saturday, the situation was
the same.

That may seem shocking to some, who
believe that after a month of drills, there
should be some consensus about who will
start the season. But neither Gallagher nor
Brechbill is shocked at all. Both realize that
spring practice is a time in which to
experiment, a getting-acquainted stage in
which players are introduced to new
positions, not a time in which ﬁnal decisions
are made.

“Spring ball doesn’t really matter as far
as starting positions are concerned,”
Gallagher explained. “What counts is how
well you do in fall camp. Those ten days are

- the time in which youlusually win a starting

job.”

Brechbill knows how true that is.
year, the 6-3, 253 pound tackle started at
offensive right tackle during spring drills,
only to lose his job to Art Bortnik during fall
camp. Brechbill spent the rest of the season
sharing backup duties with Gallagher at left
tackle.

“I was all ﬁred up about starting last
spring,” he said. “Then fall practice came
and I wasn’t starting any more. They moved
Art to left tackle and Beef (Matt Carroll)
from guard to tackle. That hurt me a lot.”

The experience left Brechbill a bitter,
although changed individual.

 ;a'g,s“:. am. hL'*Jl»‘E2‘Ed\¢'%?f~.?‘v§* I "

KURT BRECHBILL

‘ ‘I’ve matured a lot since then,” Brechbill
said. “l’ve gotten much more serious about
myself as a football player and person. This
year, I know if I want to start, I’m going to
have to_ be a little more consistent and
concentrate a lot harder.”

Gallagher, who spent last season as a
back-up at both tackle positions, also knows
what it is going to take to crack the starting
hneup. '

“A lot of hard work,” he said. “Kurt
knows it. I know it. Right now, we have
some friendly competition going. I’m not
comfortable sharing the job with Kurt, and I
don’t think he's comfortable sharing it with
me. Everyone's out there to be ﬁrst team.
You wouldn’t be playing football right if
you weren't.” .

If the seasonw re to start next week, Pitt _ .
Q _ ,,,,z,‘.'é.‘,*-..‘*,,,    Sr P‘ fJag2,.p.:r a»-s:.wx.* the V, , « , r -

offensive line coach Don Boyce would have a
difficult time deciding which of the two
juniors-to-be would start. As it is, fall camp
isn’t for another three months, and the
season opener with Tulane is four months
away, so Boyce has time in which to decide.

“They’re both pretty even right now,”
Boyce said late last week. “Neither one is
doing as well as Ithink they can be doing.
Both have a long way to go to improve.
There are just some things they have to do
better. They have to pass block better. They
have to know their assignments better.

“Both have given us a lot of effort,”
Boyce continued. “We’re just expecting
more improvement from both before the
season starts.”

Gallagher and Brechbill ended up at left
tackle in different ways. Gallagher was
redshirted after his freshman year, and
spent his ﬁrst season at Pitt playing
defensive tackle for the Panthers’ junior
varsity team.

Brechbill has been an offensive tackle
since coming to Pitt from Upper. St. Clair
High School two years ago.

‘ ‘We're both in the picture a lot more this
year, ” Gallagher said. “We both know that
a lot of things can change during the course
of a season. There’s so many little things
that go into starting. Whether we start or
not, we both know we’ll be playing a lot.

Left tackle appears to be one of the two
unsettled positions on the offensive line.
The other is at left guard, where freshman
Dan Fidler, a junior college transfer from
Arizona and junior Scott Hartman are
ﬁghting it out for the starter job.

freshman from New York, right guard Matt
Carroll, who is moving back to guard after a
year’s stay at right tackle, and center Walt

Brown all seem firmly entrenched.

“We have some spots to ﬁll,’ ’ said Boyce,
noting the graduation losses of starters Jim
Buoy, George Link, Bortnik and all-America
center Tom Brzoza from last year’s line.
“It’s going to take some time to see who’s
going to play and where.”

One thing is definite and that’s the fact
when fall camp opens, Ed Gallagher and
Kurt Brechbill will spl-it ﬁrst-team duty at
left tackle, but when it ends, they will make
the starting lineup.

Until then, it’s wait-and-see.

“I’ll be tliinking a lot about fall camp this

a summer,” Brechbill said. Gallagherwould

Pastin’s Clutch Hit
Gives Mitters Split

By MARY SJIUZINEC
Pitt News Staff’ Writer

When a team opens its season,
freshman are usually given an
adjustment period to gain conﬁ-
denceand ready themselves for the
switch from high school to college
competition. They are expected to
make mistakes. They aren’t
expected to be stars.

Pitt freshman Jim Pastin doesn't
know that.

The catcher from Sto Rox High
School stepped to the plate and
delivered a key double to bring
home two runs and give Pitt a 4-3
win over Kent State in the nightcap
of a double header Saturday at
Trees Field; The Panthers lost the
ﬁrst game, 5-3.

In the second contest, Pitt trailed,
3-2, getting its runs when another
freshman catcher, Dave DiCello,
blasted a homer over the centerﬁeld
fence in the sixth.

In the ninth inning, Mark ‘Stevens
walked, Don Nania sacriﬁced and
Kurt Leitholf received a base on
balls before Pastin soared his
double into deep center, scoring
Stevens and Leitholf.

The game was scoreless until the
fourth, despite a second-inning
threat by Kent State. Panther
starting pitcher Mike Luciow
started the inning by walking three
batters but pitched his way out of
the jam by forcing a pop up and a
double play.

All three Kent State runs were
scored in the fourth when the
Golden Flashes put together three
walks and two singles.

Pittscoredaruninthatinning
when Art Bortnick grounded a
single up the middle after walks to
Duane Sakanich and Tony Roperti
and an inﬁeld single by Dan
Smodic.

Marc Bianco relieved Luciow in
the sixth and received. the win after
two strong innings.

Pastin displayed offensive ﬁre-
works in the ﬁrst game when he
powered a three-run homer over the
right ﬁeld fence in the sixth,
bringing home Nania and Leitholf.
Nania opened the inning by
singling, and Leitholf reached base
by lining a shot to the 328 mark in
leftﬁeld.

Four of Kent State's five runs
were scored in the ﬁrst two innings
on four hits, three walks and two
errors.

In the Kent State sixth, two
batters singled and a third dropped
a hit into right, but Stevens ﬁred a
strike to the plate to nail the runner.
The Golden Flashes then scored a
run on a throwing error to first base,
making the score, 5-0.

Don Koller the distance and
received the loss.

“We’re still not getting the
runs,” said Pitt coach Bob Lewis.
“We can’t expect the pitchers to
throw shutouts every game.”
PITTCHES: Pastin had three hits
and ﬁve RBI’s for the afternoon..
Pitt hosts Robert Morris at Trees
Field on Wednesday at l p.m..Only
a handful of fans braved Saturday's
games in the chilling wind. “Tell
the fans there are only a few seats
left for Wednesday’s game,” Lewis
said wryly.
