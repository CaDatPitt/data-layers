Tsang Joins University

Dr. Chiu-Sam Tsang, dean of the University of Hong Kong, has recently

No one can doubt that the recent changes in the regulations for graduate
school deferments will affect the personal lives of many students. But a number
of students lead-ers surveyed by The Pitt News expressed concern for others,
more widespread consequences——-most notably a decrease in the pool of people

with advanced degrees in the next decade.

Joanne Telerico said, “We can't afford culturally and intellectually the loss

o-f so many potential Ph.D. candidates.”

Expressing his personal views, Ken Schueler stated, “It’s revolting to think
what the government is doing to the Ph.D. level. It's actually an anti-intellectual

stand."

far outweigh these immediate
aids.” H A

Schueler added that “educa-
tion is no longer the primary
goal of the government. Aca-
demic appropriations are con-
tinually being cut because of
the war effort. These ever-chang-
ing draft policies make a stu-
dent's life unpredictable.”~

Meyers questioned the amount
of time spent by the administra-
tion on the new draft laws con-
sidering the long term effects
of the policy. He stated that
“the educational community de-
clared that there would be se-
vere repercussions from this act
in the 70's.” He felt that not
en-ough time was spent in view
of the serious consequences of
such a decision.

_0n the other hand, Armand
Belly believes that the new laws
will be fairer than those in the
past. He feelt that it is unjust
“for the poor people to ﬁght a
War caused by the rich.”

Marc Spiegel stated that “it
was the lesser of some evils.”

Armand Belly pointed out
that “it could problems for the
army because m-ost of the op-
position to the war comes from
college students.”

“There must be someone else
they can call,” said Joanne Tel-
erico.

S-peigel -aded that “the lottery
would be better.”

S-chueler concluded by stating
that “you just don’t reverse po-
licy in midstream like the gov-
ernment is doing and upset the
balance of student’s lives. Stu-
dents can justifiably object to
being shifted back and forth.”

been notified of the approval of his visa to the United States. He is scheduled

to teach two courses in contemporary Chinese history here at the University.

Due to the delay of the State Department concerning-his visa status, a res-
olution proposed by Student Government (SG) last Jan. .10 directed SG to send
a telegram to President Johnson. The telegram stated: “We are concerned that

since Aug. 1 there has been no action upon the visa -status of Dr. Tsang, dean. of

the University of Hong Kong. We have anxzicusly awaited his arrival to teach

at our University which has been delayed by State Department inaction. We urge

you to immediately grant Dr. Tsang’s visa.”
The telegram was signed by Ken Frederick on behalf of SG.
As a result, Dr. Tsang received notice Feb. 5 from the American Consu-
late General in Hong Kong of the approval of his visa to the United States.
Ken Frederick, former president of SG, received a letter from Dr. Tsang

Only 2 Pet. of College Students
Are Found to Be Active Leftists

Despite their frequent ap-
pearances in the popular
press, leftist activists are a
small minority of American
college students, according
to two contributors to the
winter issue of Daedalus, the
journal of the American Aca-
’demy of Arts and Sciences.

“In the United States today,
the largest campus political
groups are the Young Demo-
crats and Young Republicans,
which have a total combined
membership of under 250000
members, as contrasted to 7,000
members of the new-left Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society,”
re-ports Seymour Martin Lip-
set, professor of government
and and social relations at Harv-
ard University.

No more than two per cent
of college students are in the
activists groups, estimates Rich-
ard E. Peterson, a research psy-
chologist with the Educational
Testing Service.

“The overwhelming majority

Annual Photo
Contest Begins

The annual Tom Vrana Photo
contest is being sponsored joint-
ly by Pi Delta Epsilon, Pitt Club,
and the Office of Student Publi-
cations,

Contestants must submit one
mounted print no larger than
11" x 14" in each of the follow-
ing four categories: Campus
Scene, Portrait, Action, Personal
Choice. Each category will be
judged separately. The photo-
grapher receiving the highest
number of points from a panel
of judges will receive a first
place prize of $20. In addition,
a $10 prize will be awarded for
the best print in each category.
The first place winner will have
one of his four pictures printed
in the 1968 OWL.

Prints must be submitted no
later than March 20, 1968. Entry
blanks may be obtained at the

are politically apathetic——caught
up in their vocational academic,
and hedonistic pursuits,” Mr.
Peterson adds.

Both articles indicate that stu-
dents in the humanities and so-
cial sciences are more likely to
be members of activist groups
than are students in engineer-
ing, vocational, or pre-profes-
sional training‘.

Peterson adds that student
leftists are usually “intelligent,
independent, non-careerist off-
spring of affluent parents. They
are usually enrolled in the best
and most libertarian colleges
and universities.”

He notes that student leftists,
despite their small number, have
had a signiﬁcant impact on the
nonacademic side of university
life. but have been less success-
ful in changing academic poli-
cies.

Summarizing. he writes, “His-
torians will credit the student
leftists of the 1960's with being
a major stimulus for reforms

in higher education; these will
mainly mean greater personal
and academic freedom for stu-
dents. . . . Outside the universi-
ty, however, the impact of the
student left still largely remains
to be seen.”

Lipset’s article introduces the
10th anniversary issue of Dae-
dalus, which is devoted to “Stu-
dents and Politics.” He suggests
that more attention has been fo-
cused on the American student
movement today than in the
past, because intellectuals and
students “have remained a force
of new radical leadership while
other elements of society have
not.”

He points out that organized
workers and labor-oriented par-
ties that were leaders of radical
movements in the 1930's have
been integrated into the politic-
al system.

“As such, they are not con-
cerned with policies and pro-
grams that may upset the po-
litical system,” he writes.

The Byrd’s Greatest Hits

by HOBART HARRIS

Every once and a while you
buy an album -that’s “The Best”
of somebody, and, lo and behold,
it is. You listen to each of the
songs, and you realize that mos-t
of them were your favorites
when they were on the radio.

I bought The Byrds Greatest
Hits on a whim, and discovered
I had picked up an album that
will probably turn into my fav-
orite.

lEvery rock group developes
a chordal repertoire that is dis-
tinctly its own. Add this to the
personality of its «drummer and
the -choice of songs, and you
have a group's signature, the
cues you use to identify them
the first time you hear . them
sing. The Byrd’.s hallmark is
their beat and their melody.

The beat is always moving,
dniving producing the perfect
background for the melody of
the songs. “So You Want to be
a Rock and Roll Star” is a
perfect examyple of this. The
first lines in each stanza are
fast, pushing hard, each word
pronounced like a small, bitter
explosion.

Then in the second part of
the song the singing changes to
a slow plaintive roll, like a
punted football at the very top
of its are, suspended high and
almost motionless over the
world, then sinking slowly into
the crowd below. And under this
is that -steady beat, separate but
at the same time interwined
with the singing. ':A.n.<1..vvhhhe.n

The effect is beautiful.

New York, N. Y. 10017

This same contrast of beat
and accompaniment‘ to tone is
extended in two other songs on
the album, where at the end of
each song, the group hums sev-
eral deep, harmonic tones, while
the beat continues in the back-
ground, slowly dying with the
final bars. Listening, you are
singing the song over in your
humming In the foreground.

There are many more such
effects spread throughout the
album, more than can be men-
tioned. But that's why the al-
bum can be call-ed “The Byrd's
Greatest Hits”--they’ve had more
than enough to justify the title.

Many of the new rock groups
have abandoned harmony and
continuity to punctuate their
message, or have adopted a halt-
ing style for its own sake. Many
of the Beatles’ songs do this, vir-
tually abandoning musical con-
tinuity for textual continuity. If
you like that, fine. You'd prob-
ably make a good jack-hammer

driver. The Byrds see it the
other way.

 

AID Officials Study at Pitt

Twenty officers of the Agen-
cy for International Develop-
ment (AID) are at the Univers-
ity’s Graduate School of Public
and International Affair s..

(GSPIA) These officials come
from AIDS Washington head-
quarters and from field offices
in El Salvator, Guatemale, Guy-
ana, Laos and Vietnam, .

Twin goal of the institute
are (1) increasing individual
sensitivity to cultural differences
and (2) increasing the AID of-
ficial’s understanding of nation-

al development in its variety of
economic, political, social and
cultural settings. The institute
will also explore the problem
of managing AID development
projects. Participants will ana-
lyze the problems created by
working with host government
administrations, contractors and
international agencies.

This institute is the first of
six programs which the Grad-
uate ‘School will conduct the
next two years under a $300,000‘
contract received last fall from
AID.

ery and auxiliary systems (electrical, pro-
pulsion, control, etc.). in addition to devel-
oping basic improvements in performance
and reliability, the Division concentrates
on ship silencing, new concepts in energy
conversion and control, ways to minimize
friction and wear, special operating ma-
chinery for deep-diving vessels; and tough,
resistant naval alloys to meet all ocean
environmental conditions.

The Annapolis Division buildings—now
more than 50 of them—house some of the
finest research, experimental and evalua-
tion equipments of their kind, such as
high-speed computers, electric power gen-
erators, vibration and shock test stands,
metals composition analysis instruments,
cryogenic storage and handling facilities,
physics and chemistry labs, and complex
instrumentation for measuring strain,
stress, pressure, acceleration, velocity,
performance, and reliability. The Division
grounds resemble a modern industrial park,

Editorial: A New Accountability

We students are in the post-World War II era, and a com-

mon observation of our generation has been that we have never
known war and the effects it brings; no one can say that now.
Critics of students’ protests against the war in Vietnam have
continually stated that men in college had no right to protest a
war for which they are exempted from service; they cannot say
that anymore.

Although the Vietnamese war is an undeclared one, this is
but a mere technicality that seems more superficial as each addi-
tional effect of the war occurs. And people cannot contend that
students are unaffected any more; the new draft regulation insur-
ed that. A student protest has more significance now, for stud-
ents are fighting for their lives.

We concede that the new draft. regulations are more equi-
table than those of the past theoretically, in that everyone is
now fair game. Practically, however, the air of uncertainty
that hangs over the heads of our graduating seniors and first
year graduate students in the professional schools is hard to jus-
tify. These students have an investment, too, an investment in
their future; now they do not know what the next day’s mail
will bring and must wait that painful wait to see what their
plans will be for the coming few years.

People can justify this, saying that this is wartime and we
have no choice, but we ask these same people to remember that
this is no World War II where our country’s entry was regarded
as our only course by most Americans; our entry in the Vietnam-
ese war has triggered a protest from such a sizeable group of
Americans that it cannot be dismissed. There is no longer solely
a fringe element opposed to the Vietnamese war; when such re-
spected forces as The New York Times joins the cause, criticism
of the war has ‘become an acceptable stand. And if large numbers
of students were against the war before the announcemet of the
new draft regulations, we can venture a guess that those who
were in doubt have now crystallized their feelings. -The result
of this new turn is a more vehement attitude by many toward a
war in which they do not believe but are being forced to serve
without completing their education.

This is the saddest aspect of it all; men must give up every-

can counter this statement, pointing to the thousands of men who

have already lost their lives in Vietnam. All we can say is that
we have sacrificed far too many men already, and the results
of this sacrifice are questionable. How many sacrificial lambs

Letters to the Editor

The Heads Rolled

YOU WON’T call Peggy Fleming a spas-
tic if she slips on an icy sidewalk. You won't
say Willie Mays is a hotdog if he strikes out
twice in a row. So why damn the University
coaches so soon after winning seasons ?

In 1963, John Michaelosen coached a
Panther football team that was ranked third
in the nation and had a nine victory sea-
son. A short two and a half years later,
Michaelosen was “asked to retire.” In 1964,
Bob Timmons took a ﬁne basketball team
to the post-season National Invitational
Tournament. He has suffered incredible
abuse ever since.

It is more than just the nature of sport
for fans to scream for a coach's life after
two or three had seasons following a quick-
forgotten winner. Schools have had losing
teams under the same coach for much longer
periods than the University has. It is more
than just Athletic Director Frank Carver’s
reluctance to ﬁre his own men because they
were “nice guys.” He has to give them a
chance to prove or completely disprove
themselves. And Ebeneezer Scrooge would
be hailed as a campus hero if he coached a
winner. UCLA coach Tommy Prothro and
Green Bay Packer coach Vince Lombardi
are not noted for their kindly dispositions.

THE RECENT high muo_rtality rate of
University coaches is fully integrated into
the generally mi_ser'—ible condition of all Uni-
vers.it.y affairs. The athletic losers have bo-th
augmented the aura of Pitt pessimism and
tl1cy’ve served as scapegoats for it._ The
long-term coaches have been the sacriﬁcial
lambs offered to the gods In h0PeS Of bet-
terment. _ ,

The year of Michaelosen’s and T1m_mon s
winners was a happy one. The dynamic and
highly popular Edward Litchﬁeld reigned
as Great Pumpkin. The ﬁnancial problems
were still a year of milblicity away. Every-
one loved the real Homeoomine‘ ﬂ03«tS 0“

 real trailer trucks. One John Vrana sailed

unopposed into the Student Government
presidency. “Apathy” was a word used only
on freshman Enorlish themes. The disasters
since this lovely year are all too well known-

Universitv athletics died with every-
thing elese. The miserable teams received—-
and deserved——part.ial blame for the P132119
of "student Apathy.” The situation held
little hope for future improvement; with no
“winning tradition”. how could the old ﬁx-
tures recruit high school stars? They could-
and didn't. The demand for new
faces was inevitable.

by Dan Lichtenstein

B-ut Michaelosen’s, Timmon’s and Rees’
failures were not just the result of a Uni-
versity fad. These coaches were horrible re-
cruiters, and everyone knew it. They hadn’t
the dynamism, personality and energy
which are absolutely necessary in a vitally
crucial role of collegiate coaching. Their
departures because of this deﬁciency are
perfetcly contrasted by the permanence of
two other coaches.

Jim Banner’s varsity track team has
won only two indoor meets in the last two
seasons, yet he is respected as one of the
top coaches at the University. The record-
breaking performances he has produced
from his under-manned team have been fan-
tastic. But even more impressive is his
freshman team: Banner has brought at
least three potentially national stars to the
University. Three champions added to a
continually depth—less “minor” sport is an
incredible recruitment achievement.

FOOTBALL COACH Dave Hart has led
the two worst teams in University history,
but he has earned respect for his recruit-
ment success. Hart's freshmen are as legen-
dary as Banner’s, although Hart hasn't had
time to prove that he can adequately coach
the raw material as well as Banner can.
Sparkling moments against Army, Navy
and Syracuse this fall breed optimism for
Hart. But it would be worth it to double
Harts salary and let him go play in the
mud in Trees Field if he continues to re-
cruit as successfully. A

The young and dynamic have replaced
the old and tired; it sounds like the theme
for a freshman book report. But success
seems to be returning to University ath-
letics. A softened football schedule plus
Hart's recruiting may counteract the lim-
ited scholarships and high entrance re-
quirements. Banner will get an indoor Tar-
tan track this summer; that and Trees Hall
are baubles that will attract many high
schoal stars. Freshman basketball coach
Tim Grgurich may ﬁnally bring a few bas-
ketball players to the University. The
wrestling team’s upset of perennially pow-

ea-

 

erful Lehigh last weekend is another indica-

tion of future victory.
Bobby Lewis’ baseball team is always a
winner despite the lack of publicity . . . or
maybe because of it. How many people know
Lewis has a recognized All-American, or
that last year’s varsity captain has already
signed a pro contract? .
THE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT has
more money than it did several years ago.
It has some ﬁne facilities, top-notch recruit-
ers and energetic coaches. The coaches with
only a past have gone; the coaches with
only a future are here. Their future can
raise the University above its status. of
being the New York, Mets of intercollegiate.

   

 

AWS Chairman
Hits Editorial

Editor, The Pitt News:
Speaking as a chairman in
A.W.S. Council this year, I
would like to make a few com-
ments and corrections concern-

,'__ Um uditulj A.W.S. ._ _.,____ _ , _ _
1FI‘1i%st‘ d)1?uzIi‘ll,eAl.V(\)/'I.‘§}pr((;If>abl'V\fi.abs' On Coach Choice 

accomplished more at Pitt than
any other student organization,
including Student Government.
The only reason that students
are unaware of A.W.S. accom-
plishments is that the Pitt News
refuses time and time again to
print articles submitted by mem-
bers of AVVS Council. Thus,
there is, indeed, a lack of com-
munications. Could this indicate
some bias on the part of the
Pitt News? In your editorial you
suggested that perhaps A.W.S.
should “also concern itself with
university-wide issues, rather
than only women's activities.”
Is this meant to suggest that
perhaps we need another Stu-
dent Government? Isn't our
present Student -Government
doing an efficient job?

A.W.S. was headed this year
by an outstanding leader who
did an excellent job. A.W.S. is
already headed in the right di-
rection. All that remains for our
new President is to go forth in
the same direction.

An error was made in the
statement that “approximately
six per cent of those women eli-
gible to vote” voted. This is
incorrect. One-Sixth of those
women eligible to vote voted.
This seems to be about par for
all pitt elections.

In conclusion, if you are re-
lating apathy to A.W.S., you'd

best correct yourselves. If ap-
at-hy is a characteristic at Pitt,
perhaps it is due to organiza-
tions such as the Pitt News
which promotes apathy.
An A.W.S. Chairman
1967-1968

Students Advise

Now since Mr. Timmons has
retired from basketball, the ath-
letic director, Frank Carver and
the Athletic Committee has to
name his successor, In a few
weeks close to 80-100, applica-
tions will flood the Athletic Di-
ector’s office. These will include
several well-known high school
coaches as well as college
coaches. Our question is why
should Pitt have to go outside
the University to look for a
coach. The University has a well-
qualified coach in Mr. Tim Grgu-
rich, currently the freshman
mentor. Mr. Grgurich a former
Pitt star and member of two
post-season tournament teams
has been a winner. He was a
winner as a ballplayer-fand is
a winner now as coach of the
freshmen. His freshmen team
last season compiled the best
record in Pitt basketball his-
tory and this year’s team is in
the migpts, of a Winning season.
If Frank Carver says failure
breeds failure, then winning
breeds winning. Mr. Grguri-ch
is a winner. Give him the chance
to do the job.

Holly-Led Thinclads
F ace Delaware Test

Roger Holly and Jack Neyer head ten member
of the injury-hampe-red and ﬂu—ridden varsity trac
-eam tomorrow in the «second annual Delaware Invita
étional track meet.
, Nyer and Holly finished one-two in the 600 yard run
Elast week when the thinclads defeated slip-pery Rock.
Neither Paul Greig nor Paul Zink, both of wh-om showed
signs of flu in last week's meet, will make the trip. G.reg Ellis
who-broke the school shot put record against Slippery Rock
will also miss tomorrow's meet due to injuries received in
an automobile accident.

Joining Holly and Neyer, who will both compete in the
000, are Chet Wojiechowski and Skip Orszulak. “Wojo” and
Orszulak ﬁnished first and second, respectively, in the 60 yard
dash against Slippery Rock, and they will compete in tha
event tomorrow.

Rob McElheny will compete in the broad jump, the high
jump, and the triple jump. “Mac” won the high jump with a
leap of six feet last week, but will have to go higher to win
at Delaware. There are 13 schools competing in the mee
and some good competition.

The opposition won't bother Holly and Neyer. “We realize
there will be a good field,” said Holly, “but Jack (Neyer)
and I are ready both mentally and physically.”

. Assistant coach Gary Meckley, who was standing in part
of the week for coach Jim Banner, looked to the meet op-
timistically. “The team finished second last year, and has
a good chance of winning this year, “Meckley said.

Banner is in eastern Pennsylvania; visiting high schools
in an effort to recruit members for next year’s team. He
will join the team in Delaware. \

Joining Neyer and Holly on the mile relay team will be
Carlos Rei.sen and Keith Stoeber. Although the relay team
will have to run its best time to win, there is a good chanc
they will do it.

9‘ presenting the fresh team in the only event open to
lies men will is 3 males: '1'-'él'a'y team composed of ,Jerry
Richey, Smitty Brown, Rudy Hufnagl and Wally Sweiger.

' Brown and Sweiger will run the re1ay’s 440 yard dashes.
Hufnagl will run the half mile, and Richey will anchor the
team with a mile run. Am-ong the four runners. five SChO01
records are held.

Richey holds the -school record in the mile, two-mile, an-d
1000 yard run; Brown holds the fresh 440 record; and Huf-
nagl holds the fresh 600 yard dash record. The fresh med-
ley team should be favored to win.

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
       

        
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

     
  
 
  
 

 
   
 

   
    
 
  
   
  
   
  
  
    
  
  
   
   
  
  
 
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
  

 Penn State Tomorrow

l by MIKE BROURMAN
., - Assistant Sports Editor

 ‘Playing one of their most inspired

 games, the Panthers tired to make Bo-b Tim-

mons’. last home game a winning one, but

' the referees were unimpressed‘ and led West Vir-

W-ginia to an 87-76 win Wednesday night at the

Field House.

Tomorrow afternoon the cagers -visit Penn
State. The Nittany Lions won the ﬁrst meeting,
66-43,-atth-‘e Field. But it was the WVU game

Timmons talked about.

.0 “What can you do with 0-fficiating like that,”
 said ‘Tim-morrs. “I'd rather play on the road than
 -at home. We get better refs on the road.”

A _  ’l‘hc,j‘ chief complaint of Timmons and the
2 _IPanther fans were a half dozen goaltending vio-
 lations against WVU’s Carrie Bailey that were
.f,-not called.

7 “We -couldn't drive on that side,” commented
Paul Naponick. “Because if yo-u put it up there.
.mhe;’d bat them away, and the refs wouldn't call
., it‘), K "

’ _For the second straight game, the c-agers
were hurt by a multiple point «play. The Moun-
taineers‘ scored ﬁve points on two foul shots, 3.
technical foul, and a jump shot without the Pan-
thers touching the ball.

Thait gave West Virginia a nine point lead
with eight minutes to play and the cagers could-
- n’tclose the gap.

Up until that point, the contest had been a
shooting duel between Dave Reaser and Bob
jHummelJ of West Virginia and Tony De-Lisio
"and-"Pete Smith of the Panthers.

Smith also playing his last home game. He
4- cored 17 points. “Pete's played two great games
for us back to back,” said Timmons. “And we
a.d«t.o play him and Tony all the way. Wewere

Matmen Host Staters,
Gun For Second Upset

by ROY JACOBS
Over a thousand fans savored the sweet taste of vic-
tory last Saturday at the Field-House when the varsity
wrestlers upset Lehigh, and coach Dave Adams hopes that

the same type of -enthusia'stic crowd shows up for tomorrow's 2
p.m. meeting with Penn State. The home team may need the extra

boost.

“Our fans have been great this year,” acknowledged Adams,
“and I'm anticipating a large student turnout. I think the fans have

gotten their money’s worth
when they've come out. We're

3-0 at home, and our kids have A

looked good in all the home
meets.”

The grapplers never looked
better in winning their fourth
meet of the season against Le-
high, 19-13. But Adams feels
still more improvement is need-
ed to beat Penn State.

“I don't think there is any
question that Penn State is the
second toughest team we'll face,”
commented Adams, putting the
Lion-s right behind Navy.

“We have to -catch them ‘hav-
ing a letdown,” he continued,
“and we have to give a super-
perform=ance——one that would
exceed even last week against
Lehigh.”

Last Saturday night, Penn
State lost its first match of the
season to an eastern team, drop-
ping a 17-14 match to Navy.
Previously, their only defeat
was at the hands of Oklahoma.

“They (Penn State) could re-
act one of two ways.” speculated
assistant coach Bob Fehrs. “They
could get real excited about to
morrow’s meet and come back
strongly. Or, since it is their
only loss in the East, they may
be down from it.”

Adams was unsure how the
individual bouts would shape up
because Penn State has juggled
its lineupa lot this season. Grap-
pler Randy Kahler is listed as
“doubtful” for the varsity after
suffering strained neck muscles
against Lehigh, and his loss cuts
down Adams’ maneuverability.
On pa.per, Penn State is impos-
ing.

“They have ﬁve real strong
weights,” remarked Adams, “and
the others are all respectable.
To beat them, you’ve got to beat
all the respectable wrestlers
and break through against one
top-notcher.”

State's key men are Wally
Clark at 130, Vince Fitz at 1.45
or 152, Ma.tt Kline at 160, Bob
Funk at 177, and captain Rich
Lorenzo at 191. Clark faces Dick
Shildt of the varsity in what
could be a preview of the East
ern ﬁnals.

Dick Shildt and Ron Schuch-
ert were recently named varsi-
ty co-captains.

Fresh Face
Rough Going
At Clarion

Although it may seem like
like a step down in Wrest-
ling Clarion State after
a step down in wrestling
Clarion State after wrest-
ling Lehigh, freshman coach
Bob Fehrs indicated that on the
freshman level it isn't. He am?
his squad will have a chance to
ﬁnd out for sure tonight when
they meet Clarion at 7:30.

“Clarion may‘ actually have
a, better team than Lehigh," of-
fered Fehrs. “It’s hard to tell.
They're undefeated.”

Fehrs pointed out that in the
scores he’s seen, Clarion has won
big. For example, they stopped
Indiana, 37-0. And they over-—

“It was the same old story,”

dropped the first and last re-
lays just couldn’t make up the
points.” “We took firsts, but we
didn’t have enough guys to gain
those important second and
third spots consistently,” added
his twin brother Howard. “It
was pretty dismal,” echoed sen-
ior Chris Price.

The swimmers’ performance
did have its bright spots, though.
The Norris twins each gained
a first and a second place, and
each swam a leg of the medley

Richard captured his victory

Cubs Earn “A” For Effort
In Loss to WVU Freshman

By JERRY GRUEGEL

The freshman basketball
an “A” for effort, if nothing
else, after Wednesday n.ight’s
loss to the Little Mountaineers
of West Virginia.

“We played just like when
we beat West Virginia earlier
this year,” insisted freshman
basketball coach Tim. Grgurich.
“We ran them all over the court.
There’s not a doubt in my mind
that we outplayed them, I think
their own coach would admit
it also.”

The Cubs’ overall performance

lessened the upset that Grgu- .

rich felt when the game ended
with his team on the short side

of an 85-82 score. And Grgurich
was particularly pleased with
the performance of backcourt
shooting ace Mike Caldwell.

“Caldwell was the best player
on the court tonight,” analyzed
Grgurich. “He was shooting well
and moving better than ever.
He’s really coming along.”

But costly mistakes in the fin-
al minutes of play made their
efforts useless. Cub players mis-
sed two layups late in the game

“We're a small team and we
can’t afford to make mistakes,”
realized Grgurich.

Since the mistakes can’t be

retracted, the least the Cub s
earned is that “A.” for effort.

Mob Chases Hepburn
In “Wait Until Dark”

by PAUL ANDERSON

Wait Until Dark is an intriguing exercise in backyard
horror. Living on one of those imaginative blocks in New
York City. Audrey Hepburn, a very cool blind girl and
and handsome photograp-her’~s (Ephrem Zimbalist, Jr.) wife, in-
advertently becomes the un-proud pofsessor of a doll with dope
insides. The Mob, anxious to get their hands on the heroin inside,
don't seem to mind at all if little Audrey gets spilled all over
her kitchen floor in the process.

Playing upon her blindness, they concoct an elaborate ruse, in
which each one of them ta.kes on double -or triple roles, 1:0 gain 30'
cess to her cellar dwelling so they can search it. Richard Crenner
(Luke in ‘fT‘ne Real McCoys,” remember?) is a small-time h00d1l1m
with a heart who poses as an old army buddy of Miss Hepburn’s
husband. He -uses the familiar “he saved my life but 13 1200 m0déSt
to tell anyone about it” bit. Jack Weston plays a corrupt cop who

selves that she knows where the doll 1.S and 1s concealing it, two

Left alone with the most malevolent minion of evil, Miss Hep-

him and she has forgotten about the refrigerator light. Miss Hep-
burn appears to be at the mercy of Arkin the pitiliss when . . .

Only a willing suspension of reality can turn thi§ ﬁlm int0 51
genuine thriller. If we are willing to accept what M_1SS Hepburn
does and disregard what she should do, the movie can indeed prove
an exciting diversion.

Sightless, friendless and helpless; trapped in a darkened room

Friday, February 23,1963 -  

Dr. Alec Nove, a well-known
specialist in Soviet economics,
will speak on the “Soviet and
Hungarian Economic Reforms”
in a lecture at the University
Tuesday.

Dr. Nove’s lecture, the sec-
ond in a series being presented
by the Comparative Communist
Economic Studies, will be given
at 8 p.m. in 202, Frick Fine Arts
Building. ‘

Dr. Nove, professor of eco-
nomics at the University of Glas-
sow, is editor of Soviet Studies.
Currently, he is visiting profes-
sor of economics at the Whar-
ton School, University of Penn-
sylvania.

Comparative Communist Eco-
nomic Studies is a lecture and
research seminar under the aus-
pices of the new multi-univers-
ity’ teaching and research pro-
gram in comparative commun.
ism (a joint project of the Uni-
versity. Camegie-M e 1 10 11, Du-
quesne, Chatham and Mt. Mer-
cy). During this and the next
academic year, 12 scholars will

but a quick succession fo ration-
al actions would only end the

body would want that.

Miss Hepburn’s portrayal of
“the champion blind girl” is
cute but unconvincing. Sight-
less for only a year, she has al-
ready developed a sense of hear-
ing so acute that she can pick
up the sound of someone dust-

ing svelt and almost Oedipal.
Gloriously imperturbable to the
passage of time, she hasn’t aged
a second since Breakfast at Tif-
fany’s.

All in all, Wait Until Dark is
a better than average thriller
with a few beguiling twists. It
has got one of those screamer
scenes where we heave a sigh
of relief and start looking for
our coats thinking, “Oh, thank
God. It’s all over. S.he’s safe”
only to realize that her ordeal
is far from over. But don't wor-
ry I didn’t ruin it. You’ll nev-
er expect it.
