Faculty
union vote

not seen
as imminent

By Michael Ashford
Special Projects Editor

Contrary to the headline of The Pit!
News’ last article on the potential
unionization of the Pitt faculty, there
will not be a general election in the im-
mediate future.

In clarification. University Counsel
Lewis Popper said. "It is now in the
hands ofthe Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board and whether or not they
will uphold the examiner‘s decision."

A PLRB examiner recently ruled that
the United Faculty. the campus organ-
ization seeking a general vote on
whether or not the faculty should
unionize. had not produced the re-
quired number of faculty signature
cards. According to regulations. 30
percent of the faculty must sign the
cards in support of a general vote.

The United Faculty has appealed the
ruling. claiming it had produced the re-
quired 30 percent. It is not known ex-
actly when the appeal will be addressed
by the PLRB.

According to Popper. there are two
key issues yet to be resolved before a
vote is possible. First, the PLRB must
rule on the United Faculty’s appeal
over the rejection of the initially sub-
mitted faculty count.

Secondly. if that rejection is over-
ruled and the count accepted. the
university will introduce the question
of “shared governance." This refers
to a 1980 Supreme Court ruling that
faculty at the Yeshiva University of
New York could not be considered a
group of employees in manage-
ment/labor collective bargaining.

“The issue of shared governance is
way down the road." Popper said.
“and won‘t even come up unless the
justification for an election is reached."

Popper speculated that the count had
been rejected because some of the cards
may have been “stale." in that they
were signed by faculty members who
have since left the university.

“It is a preliminary. informal pro-
cess." Popper commented. “The ex-
aminer doesn‘t tell people what is done
or why."

Popper insisted that the university
administration was not at this time
preparing to defeat the call for a general
vote if the United Faculty should win
its appeal.

“We are not making any prepara-
tions now to introduce the Yeshiva
issue as far as I know." Popper said.
“The United Faculty's issue at this
point is with the PLRB.”

Responding to United Faculty Presi-
dent Philip Wion's contention that the
university is anti-union, Popper cited
“excellent relations" with the various
unions already representing workers on
campus.

“Howeverfi Popper said. “the
university’s view is that the faculty
already share in governance through
structural means. such as the Faculty
Assembly and the appointment of
deans. In this context. we feel a facul-
ty union is inappropriate.“

THE PITT Ns  

Apartheid protesters

stage mock funeral  

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

South African exile and poet Dennis
Brutus said to protesters Friday that Pitt
is “investing [in] and proﬁting [by] op-
pression,“ and vowed not to quit
fighting until Pitt divests totally from
companies doing business in South
Africa.

Brutus. who will become the chair-
man of Pitt's black studies department
in September. spoke to a cheering
crowd of about 70 students protesting
against Pitt‘s investment policy toward
South Africa. The rally was staged in
front of the Cathedral of Learning
where the students chanted “Apartheid
kills —— Pitt pays the bills!"

The protest was held to commerate
the Sharpeville massacre of March 2 l.
1960. when South African police shot
into a crowd of black protesters. The
barrage killed 69 people. 52 of which
were shot in the back.

"We have seen a crisis in 1960 at
Sharpeville. but the crisis that continues
today and which began in August of
1984 is the greatest and most extensive
in the history of apartheid," Brutus
said to the crowd through a mega-
phone. '

Brutus is currently a faculty member
at Swarthmore College near Philadel-
phia and he said Swarthmore recently
agreed to totally divest their holdings
in companies doing business with South
Africa. Brutus estimated that Swarth-
more had approximately $43 million
invested in such companies.

The rally began in front of the
Cathedral of Learning. Students held
up white cardboard crosses each with
a name of a black South African killed
under the apartheid government. The
signs were made by VOICE. a group
from Moon Senior High School.

The students formed a line and
marched in pairs from the Cathedral of
Learning toward the William Pitt
Union. then proceeded down Fifth
Avenue. Chanting slogans such as
“Divest now! Divest now!" the
students circled and marched back up
Forbes Avenue.

At the head of the group was a black
coffin carried by four students. The
words "Death to Apartheid" were
printed in yellow on the side of the cof-
fin. and the line of demonstrators
resembled a funeral procession.

After the marchers arrived back in
front of the cathedral. the students
gathered in a semi-circle around Brutus

Apartheid oppression cited in poetry

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

The themes of freedom. oppression
and personal identity echoed through-
out the Kurtzman Room last Thursday
night as six Pitt poets read their own
verse to commemorate the Sharpeville
Massacre.

Reading poetry were Dennis Brutus.
Rob Penny. Anne Sawyer Berkley,
Chris Gilbert. Joyce Fricklen and
Maisha Baton.

On March 20. I960. 69 people were
killed in Sharpeville. a black township
in South Africa. On that day, South
African police opened fire on men,
women and children protesting their
wearing of the official passes that

blacks still carry today. Fifty-two peo-
ple were shot in the back.

“What is important about Sharpe-
ville is not that 70 people died. nor
that they were shot in the back," said
Brutus. a South African poet. “Re-
member Sharpeville because it epit-
omizes oppression more clearly than
anything else. It was the classic event.
Nowhere was racial dominance more
clearly deﬁned. Nowhere was the will
to oppress more clearly demonstrated.“

The poetry on Thursday night often
referred to the Sharpeville Massacre
and to South Africa's heroes of black
resistance. such as Nelson Mandela and
Steve Biko. But the poetry also con-
tained images of urban America. mo-
ments of self-realization and longing

Hand—in—Hand Festival:

a Volunteer

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

I think the green and orange clown
cavorting around room IKS6 Forbes
Quadrangle was working too closely
with the helium. There seemed to be
something wrong with his voice. There
really ought to have been someone
around to keep an eye out for that sort
of thing. But then. I didn’t get up ear-
ly on a Saturday to figure out why this
particular harlequin had chosen to
prance around sounding like Minnie
Mouse all day.

I reported for duty as a one-on-one
volunteer shortly after 10 a.m.. but I
wasn‘t paired with a child until after
noon. The staff members told me that
a record number of volunteers applied
to participate in this year's Hand—in-

looks back

Hand Festival. Four hundred seven
volunteers were to be paired with ap-
proximately 400 physically and inen—
tally handicapped children who had
signed up to participate.

As each child arrived at Forbes
Quadrangle. he or she was escorted by
a clown to a classroom and a waiting

. staff member who paired the child with

a volunteer. A couple of the children
shed a few tears when they were
separated from mom or dad, but the
tears turned to giggles after a few
minutes with the clowns.

One of the staff members called out
my name. It was my turn. She pointed
out a little girl in a red sweater, and
my day as a one-on-one volunteer was
underway.

Eight-year-old Kenya had big. brown

for identity and fulfillment in a world
shattered by slavery and poverty.

Professor Penny read lyrical love
poems that celebrated the black woman
and all womankind. Anne Sawyer
Berkley, a poet and author. also read
poems that linked the identity of the
poet's speaker with blacks throughout
history.

Professor Chris Gilbert read elegiac
and celebratory poems. Gilbert stated
that even in the human spirit's darkest
times, the psyche always has a secret
place within itself where it celebrates.

“There’s a certain way we inter-
nalize the oppression." said Gilbert.
speaking of South Africa’s oppression.
“But there’s a way. in another whole
part of us. that is invulnerable and that

Iliineds ofiarea ehilden attended Pit’s annual Hand—i-

survives and celebrates."

Maisha Baton read political poems
that captured experiences from the
lives of black Americans. Baton said
she wanted her poetry to make an im-
pact on society. Baton said she wrote
one poem “because of my concerns for
how we, as poets. would be able to ad-
dress the times. and how I personally
would be able to speak on something
that would make a difference and that
would not just be trivial.“

Brutus also said that poetry has to ad-
dress the problems of the real world.
“I don’t think one should treat poetry
as something in isolation." said Brutus.
“Poetry is about life. not just about
words. Poetry which divorces itself
from life becomes astonishingly phony."

eyes and wore her hair in pigtails. She
called me “Sess” because she couldn’t
pronounce “Tess." This was Kenya‘s
second Hand-in-Hand Festival, and she
pretty much knew the ropes.

“Games!" This kid had known me
for only four minutes and was already
giving me orders. Who could have
resisted those eyes‘?

Games it was. I have to compliment
festival coordinators Lori Mikelatis and
Gloria Randall and their entire staff for
their work. Forbes Quadrangle had
transfromed with streamers and bal-
loons. The carnival atmosphere was in-
fectious. Thank goodness I was wear-
ing sneakers. because Kenya kept me
literally running from table to table.

The “Velcro Game," sponsored by
Tower B's 20th floor, turned out to be
Kenya's forte. The object was to hit the
Velcro clown-face target with little
Velcro balls. This was not challenging
enough for Kenya, though, so we went
for the world-record Velcro—ball
distance throw. That was good enough.
We got a prize for that, also. Thanks
to contributers like ALCOA. Heinz
USA, Rockwell International, dozens
of other corporations, local sponsors
and several Pitt organizations, there

were plenty of prizes for everyone.

Even the exciting “Velcro Game"
posed no serious threat of capturing
Kenya’s short attention span for very
long. It was on to Lambda Sigma’s
"Fish Pond,” Theta Beta’s “Penny
Pitch" and the Nursing Students’
"String Art." But then something
mesmerized Kenya.

“Clown!" It turned out to be the
squeaky-voiced one in green and
orange, but with his voice returned to
normal. Only, Kenya remembered him
from last year, when he was her one-
on—one partner. A big hug for an old
pal, and we were off again.

Kenya decided it might be fun to
have her face painted by Fools for
Christ. It was a struggle to sit still,
especially since the brush tickled. but
soon she was sporting a pretty red tulip

' on her cheek.

Then we went back to the games.
Kenya was a shark at most of them an
pretty soon we had a shopping bag full
of prizes. We must have played every
game at least twice, and Kenya wasn't
showing the least sign of slowing
down.

We discovered something different
at another table. A woman was holding
a turtle! And she had a ferret, an
opossum and a boa constrictor. Kenya

had to pet them all. and she was not
even afraid of the boa constrictor. Pret-
ty brave for an eight-year—old girl.
especially since my macho baseball-
player Sean almost passed out just
looking at the thing.

Petting the animals seemed to have
calmed my kinetic little friend. so I
naively assumed we could sit and watch
the stage show. Silly me. After all,
what‘s music without dancing‘?

Many acts performed throughout the
day, including magician David Crone,
Faith Filled Fools and the Pitt
Cheerleaders. Kenya decided it was
time for us to dance to the tunes of Matt
and Dan Kambic. Kenya’s brand of
dancing included lots of jumping and
spinning. and soon a whole group of
clowns joined our antics.

Suddenly it was four o’clock, and
dad was there to take Kenya home.
Where had the afternoon gone? We had
such a good time Kenya didn't want to
leave. With a big hug and a promise
to come back. Kenya make her exit.

Hanging around Forbes Quadrangle.
I saw the clean—up crew taking down
the tables and streamers. Only the
dozens of balloons resting against the
ceiling acted as a reminder that the
festival was ever here.

who stood with the coffin lying before
him.

“We want freedom for people
everywhere." Brutus told the crowd.
“The fight must begin where we are,
and for those of us who are or will be
here. the fight has to be right here at
the university."

Brutus said that there are two main
reasons Pitt should totally divest. “It'll
make an impact on the economy but
more importantly it will send a message
that the people of Pittsburgh and Pitt
will not subsidize racism and will not
profit from racism.”

After Brutus finished speaking the
students laid their crosses on top of the
coffin. and the crowd formed a large
circle around the mound of signs. At
Brutus’ suggestion the students held
hands and paid tribute to thise killed at
Sharpeville. The protestors bowed their
heads and stayed silent for two
minutes.

Doug Howell. a Pitt student and a
member of Students For a Free South
Africa. urged the crowd to make their
presence known on May 29, when
Pitt's board of trustees is again
presented with a plan of total
divestment.

“It is essential that we pressure them
during the meeting to make sure they
know our voice is going to be heard,”
Howell shouted to an enthusiastic
crowd.

Howell also announced a concert to
be held April 4 on Flagstaff Hill in sup-
port of divestment. The concert will
feature local bands and will be spon-
sored by organizations from both Pitt
and CMU.

Mike Michalski, a Pitt student from
the band The Little Wretches, said he
would be interested in playing at the
concert.

“I don't think divestment from South
Africa should wait," he said. “As a
musician I‘d like to help all I can."

THE PITT NEWS

The official student newspaper of the University of Pitts-
‘burgh. «Editorial opinions are made by a majority of the

of the author and not of The Pitt News staff.

Hand—in-Hand

This Saturday the sterile spaciousness of Forbes
Quadrangle was transformed by the excitement of more
than 400 children. in a carnival as bright and spon-
taneous as any they could hope for.

The fact that these children are mentally or physical-
ly disadvantaged did not dampen the day-long festivities
at the eighth annual Hand-in-Hand Festival. A record
407 students acted as one-on—one volunteers for the
children. Each of these students acted as a companion
and guide for his assigned child as the two made their
way through a maze of games, performances and other
entertainment provided throughout the day.

The festival is a testimony to the things that can be
accomplished when groups, organizations and in-
dividuals join together for a single cause. This event
not only helped the children and gave needed exposure
to the groups involved, but it gave the students a chance
to be a part of something meaningful, to be a part of
an event where cooperation and communication are at
the forefront.

It is not often that we lift our heads from our books
or interrupt our leisure activities to see our already ac-
quired social or technical skills put to use for the beneﬁt
of others. It is not often that we even stop to recognize
the world which extends beyond that of our daily
routines. As students we should reach out and embrace
opportunities like this in which we can convert inten-
tions and ideas into positive realities. The phrase “stu-
dent activist“ may be a relic of the dreaded '60s. but
the spirit behind it was certainly present at this
weekend’s festival.

In short. the active social conscience long associated
with college students is not and should not be bound
by the scope of war and politics. Smaller statements like
an hour of time or a pint of blood may not be as dramatic
or as grandiose. but they can be twice as satisfying and
twice as effective.

“A SPECIAL DE ‘IV
ITS

 

Pro—Choicers
Challenged

I had to laugh out loud when read-
ing Miss Hunt’s article on her pilgrim-
age to Washington. D.C.. in the name
of women‘s lives. Within the article.
she contradicted everything she was
supporting; she called it "vile” and
“barbaric."

Now, let‘s get something straight. I
think that throwing around a fetus is
somewhat lacking when it comes to
tact. to say nothing of hygiene.
However. Miss Hunt. if you look at
something square in the face and call
it "vile“ and "barbaric." how can you
support it‘?

I happen to be in the medical profes-
sion. and as far as I'm concerned. abor-
tion is neither an ethical nor a religious
issue; it's a medical issue. What we're
dealing with is the deﬁnition of life.
Medically speaking. there are two
criteria for identifying life: a beating
heart and a functioning brain. Is your
heart beating. Miss Hunt‘? Then you are
alive —-- no more and no less alive than
you were when your heart beat for the
very first time. Incidentally. the grow-
ing fetus‘ bean is beating at four weeks
gestation -~ before the woman even
/\'tt(m‘.s' she 's pregnant.

Oh. l‘ve got another bit of “trivia"

for you: Before the middle of the
seventh week. the baby is responsive
to light. sound. touch and pain -
before most women have even made
their appointments for their abortions.
You can bet that baby is feeling
everything that is done to him or her.
(Ifyou don't belive me. take a trip up
to Scaife Library and look in any
reference on fetal development.)

So —— if you’re going to support
something so devoutly. it's important
for you to look it full in the face. I‘m
presenting a challenge to Miss Hunt
and every other supporter of abortion
reading this — have you ever even seen
an abortion? I have! Go down to the
Women's Health Center and observe
one — keep your eyes open and try not
to vomit. I dare you.

I will never forget the abortion I
observed for as long as I live. I must
admit. I was undecided on the issue un-
til that day. I was bloody. the mother
was screaming in pain. and (at the risk
of being vile and barbaric) I saw the
nurse piecing together tiny arms.
hands. legs and fragments of a head —
she was making sure they extracted
everything?

It was not as quick and easy as you
might think —— [the mother] was
screaming. She wound up hemorrhag-
ing and had to get two units of a blood
transfustion. I was never so horriﬁed
in my whole life. I felt sick. And I will

not to destroy it in cold blood.

I don‘t have one iota of respect for
people who support something so
blindly and don't know what they’re
talking about. So take me up on my
dare ~ go see one for yourself.

One more thing — I have a question
about the fetus that attended the march.
Was it a female‘? What are you doing
for that woman's life‘?

Name Withheld By Request

Pointless
Picketing

In response to the March 21 letter
“Racist Goodies.“ there is something
more than vaguely disturbing about the
threat to picket a candy store because
it buys its fruit slices from South
Africa.

For the past seven or so months. I
have politely declined signing any
apartheid protest petitions. joining any
protest rallies or joining in on any of
the rousing conversations on the topic
that one could ﬁnd in almost any cor-
ner of the Pitt campus. For a while. I
was only aware that something wasn't
 kosher with the whole thing. but I
couldn't really put a name to it. It has
ﬁnally hit me.

I read the letter threatening to pro-
test Goodies. and I was thinking how
really dedicated these people must be
to this cause that they would protest
fruit slices. for Pete's sake  and then.
the real reason that I am uneasy with
the whole campaign developed a name.
and everything became clear to me.
You know. South Africa is one of the
world's leading suppliers of gold and
diamonds! Yessiree. that's what has
been bothering me all these months.
Before you make the grand gesture of
abstaining from all those apartheid-
tainted fruit slices. why don’t you take
off some of the gold jewelry! Take off
the gold earrings and the gold bangles
and the rings! Take off the gold chains
and the diamond studs.

I can't stand the oppression of any
people. I can't stand the fact that peo-
ple in this world can’t feel. for them-
selves. remorse for what they are do-
ing; that it actually takes protest rallies
to tell them how horribly they are
violating the basic human rights that
every person deserves. But. I can't
stand a hypocrite either! So. before you
go protesting in front of Goodies. take
a good look at yourselves. If you‘re so

dedicated. don't just stop at fruit slices!

Please allow me to comment regard-
ing the reading comprehension test
based on "Save the Humans.“ I agree
that Mr. Crary obscures his intent with
baroque verbosity: I doubt. however.
that he eoncems himself with being in-
telligible to the general public. Perhaps
such arrogance is misplaced in a stu-
dent newspaper. but if you weed
through “Save the Humans." a
message [emerges] untarnished:

1. All the environmentalists who
jump on the bandwagon to ‘Save the
Whales’ should start worrying about
people.

2. The government unabashedly
pours money into the military budget
while funds for social programs.
research and the arts deteriorate.

3. Food and shelter are rights as in-

.alienable as life (liberty. etc.).

4. The population grows as a result
of understiinulation. (This should not
require explanation.)

Finally. I have heard many a student
mutter in literature classes. “What does
Blake (Shelley. Keats. Yeats  ) write
about‘? Does he know?“ And in re-
sponse to the question. “Does anyone
notice?” Obviously. he who composed
the comprehension exam did.

Correction: The letter which ap-
peared in the Friday. March 21 edi-
tion of The Pitt News entitled
“Racist Goodies” was published
by an editorial mistake. The letter
in question recklessly singled out
and attacked an Oakland business
establishment. It is not The Pitt

make random or unsubstantiated

The Ritual Dissent/James M. Crary
Improving The University

The corner of Fifth and Bigelow is
a hazard to make the fully-sighted walk
like the blind; and. incidentally, there
are blind persons attending classes
here. The solution is to invest in a few
pedestrian bridges. It could have prob-
ably been done for the cost of the hoary
facades on the Forbes Avenue side of
the William Pitt Union. A little less ap-
pearance and a little more substance,
please.

“The Ritual Dissent" column re-
ceived its first letter to the editor. which
was witty while intending to be hun-
ful. The sense of humor redeemed the
content which was hilarious in places,

narrow in others and on one occasion
accurate. It is time to reveal the man
under the horse‘s mask! (At least I put
my name on my columns.)

The point of the “The Ritual Dis-
sent" is to bring into focus some issues
that often get ignored. Although quite
banal on occasions —— it is certainly not
altogether accurate in the sense, for ex-
ample. of being able to detail all the
aspects of environmental damage de-
facing the earth — it does, nonetheless,
appear to this writer that as a polemical
exercise this work is at least as accurate
as most of the rhetoric ﬂoating through
printed space in this country. I consider

it a service to the university and. fur-
thermore, see it as a chance for a
chance for a little bit of petty ego ag-
grandizement. Whatever the inap-
propriate remarks may seem to imply.
and the occasional misprints, if a reader
really finds it so bad, then he/she/it
should be up here doing it himself. It's
not easy trying to make a fool of
oneself twice a week for the sake of
bringing a little sense to one’s peers and
shaking them loose from the banality
in which so many of them feel forced
to exist. Clearly, a climate of con-
troversy is irreplaceable in the
university.

Hugging! There’s another irreplace-
able element to some healthy vibes
around this place. I cannot promise that
the person directly next to you deserves
a hug. but you can always pretend for
a second. It does wonders for one‘s
sense of security.

Meanwhile. of course, the problems
of the world continue. It will not be my
practice to answer letters written about
“The Ritual Dissent.“ but just this
once. since it is the first ever to appear.
I‘m going to answer part of the ques-
tion which was addressed by the letter.

Explaining the question. “Is it a

claim to food that one is hungry?" OK,
then. We live in a society of rights and
privileges. We are sitting on top of the
mountain. Yet in order to eat decently
one must be gainfully employed, re-
gardless of economic circumstances.
Food kitchens have shortages, and, as
I pointed out, this year alone thousands
of people are going to die of hunger.
Yet these people have no funds, and
hence no legal claim on a food supply.
It is generally contended that one who
cannot survive simply succumbs to the
law of nature. and yet these laws of
nature are such that human beings, with
a little effort, can change.

Washington Post Writers Group/ Richard Cohen
Israel, The Holocaust and Contemporary Paranoia

In the course of a recent telephone
conversation. a relative said he had
received a letter from Sen. Robert
Packwood. R-Ore., and had some
questions for me: What sort of guy was
Packwood? Did I know that the letter
said there was a “conspiracy" to deny
him re-election because he was a friend
of Israel? What should be done? Easy.
I said. Throw the letter in the trash.

There are many reasons to admire
Bob Packwood. He is a leading propo-
nent of women's rights. He is a
Republican moderate (virtually an ox-
ymoron these days). a champion of
civil rights and a wise and conscien-
tious member ofthe Senate. There are
few flies on Bob Packwood.

But one of them is his willingness to
be just another politician who panders
to the paranoia ofthe Jewish communi-
ty. The "conspiracy" that recently
alarmed my relative apparently does
not amount to much. Packwood has
been able to turn over $32,000 of his

  

own campaign funds to the Oregon
GOP to help it regain control of the
state legislature. It is not immediately
clear how this will beneﬁt Israel.

Packwood is certainly not the only
politician who knows how to milk the
Jewish community. Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.. is another. A re-
cent Cranston letter said he is in trou-
ble for, among other things. his stead-
fast support of Israel. Unlike Pack-
wood. Cranston does not shy from
naming the culprit. It's Jesse Holms,
R-N.C., who is probably the best fund-
raising issue the Democrats have had
since the Great Depression. “Helms
has made the choice clear. It‘s our
freedom or Helm‘s aiiti—lsrael man-
date." Oh.

The giggles you hear are coming
from the U.S. Senate. In the first place.
it is not likely that anyone would run
for statewide office in California as an
anti-Isreal candidate. And second. Ol‘
Jesse has seen the light —— or maybe the

green. Campaign contributions or
ideology, it matters not. The senator
from the Pleistocene era is now an
Isreal supporter.

Next on the list is Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Penn. His letter said he has
been “targeted for defeat" by an
organization of Arab Americans. He
said he has to raise $240,000 by March
10 — a date. his office later said, that
is of no real critical importance. But
Arab opposition or no Arab opposition.
Specter faces no primary opponent —
and none of the Democratic senatorial
candidates are considered anti-Israel.

Enough! The fact is that anti-Israel
members of Congress are few and far
between. The reasons for that are ob-
vious. Israel is both liked and admired
by the American people. It is a fellow
democracy. an anti-communist bastion
in a key area of the world. What that
does not explain. the afﬂuence and
political activism of the American
Jewish community does. With pride

and affection. it has made Israel its
ward. No 1986 congressional election
is going to change any of that.

But that is not the impression you get
from various fund-raising letters. Even
where all the candidates support Israel
and it is not an issue, the fund-raising
letters sound the alarm. The survival
of Israel is said to be on the line. Con-
spiracies are said to be everywhere.
Arab oil money. for some reason more
odious than. say. Jewish money or
NRA money. is alleged to be buying
Congress.

No string is left unplucked and in the
rush to answer false alarms about
Israel. other concerns -— civil rights,
civil liberties. even integrity — get
brushed aside. The only standard
becomes support of Israel. and for that
a politician is permitted to fish in the
Jewish community's money pond.

letters are excused as a bad thing you
are forced to do on the way to doing
so much good. They are designed to
alarm, to excite, to scare and, like por-
nography in film. it does not matter that
they bear little resemblence to real life.
It's the emotion that counts. Passion
brings in the bucks. This is true
whatever the cause.

But there are few issues in which the
backdrop is the Holocaust and the
feared prospect is yet more deaths. To
my relative. that is what Israel means.
He believes what he reads. He thought
his computerized letter actually came
from Packwood. He believed “a con-
spiracy" was out to defeat a pro-Israel
senator and replace him with someone
hostile to the Jewish state. None of that
was true.

At stake in this election is not the
security of Israel. More and more it is
the credibility of those who claim to be
its friend.

The Pitt News, March 24, 1986

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Last fall, former Pitt coach Foge
Fazio rolled the dice when he was
selecting what defense his Panthers
were going to play. Fazio rolled a five
and two, as in a 52-defensive align-
ment. It turned out to be a losing com-

bination. as Pitt finished the season at '

5-5-1.

This year, there is a new man at the
craps table. His name is Mike Gott-
fried. He rolled a four and a three, as
in a 43—defensive front. Thejury is still
out as to whether or not it will be a win-
ning combination. but Gottfried is hop-
ing he will be rich in victories come
next November.

"We are going to play a 4-3,” Gott-
fried proclaimed on Friday. “We are
going to play aggressive and go after
people. Hopefully, we can make some
things happen. We have looked at a lot
of film and evaluated the personnel we
have, and we think this is the best front
for us right now."

When Gottfried says “we.“ he. of

course. is referring to himself and his
coaching staff. Never one to spend too
much time with the defense, the
41-year-old coach. who Pitt lured away
from Kansas. will turn the defensive
responsibilities over to his assistants.
Gottfried said defensive coordinator
John Fox and assistant head coach
Chuck Klausing will handle most of the
defensive strategy.

“I am confident in my coaches,“
Gottfried said. “1 have a good coaching
staff. Once we get in a ball game. the
defensive game plan is theirs to initiate
and control.“

Congemi ready

john Congemi will try to elp the Panthers return

\

Fox came with Gottfried to Pitt from
Kansas. Before that. he served on the
staff of the USFL’s Los Angeles Ex-
press. Klausing, of course, used to be
head coach a few blocks from the Pitt
campus. at Carnegie—Mellon.

Their philosophy is simple - be ag-
gressive. With Pitt’s top-two tacklers,
Steve Apke (162) and Tony Woods
(93), returning for a senior year. the
43-defense virtually promises success.

“I think the thing about Pitt defenses
over the years is that they have always
been aggressive,” Gottfried said.
“They have had some great defenses.
If we can play half as good as some of
the defenses that have played here, we
will be OK."

Pitt will attempt to take advantage of
the strengths of a player such as
Woods. Fox contends that there is not
a great difference between the 43-front
and the 52-front, so there should not
be that much of an adjustment problem.

“There is a lot more similarity than
people like to think between the 52 and
the 43." Fox said. “A good defensive
end in a 52 can adapt very easily to two
positions in a 43 —— either. as what we
call. a defensive end or as an outside
linebacker.“

That is how Pitt hopes to take advan-
tage of Woods’ strengths. As a defen-
sive end in Fa7.io‘s defense, Woods was
Pitt’s leading quarterback harasser.
recording 15 sacks. Unfortunately.
Woods was also forced to drop into
pass coverage at times. an area in
which he is adequate. but not as adept
as rushing the passer. That will not
happen this year.

John Congemi sat on a stool all alone
after Penn State humiliated Pitt 31-0 in
the season finale last October. Congemi
was a frustrated man. Congemi‘s ex-
pectations grew after he led the Pan-
thers to a Fiesta Bowl berth in 1983.
his sophomore season.

Congemi was a happy man. But
things hadn‘t gone very well in his foot-
ball career since that sophomore year.
His junior year was plagued with in-
juries and Pitt won only three games.
But in 1985. John Congemi was to be
the old self. With Congemi healthy. he
was expected to lead Pitt back to a post-
season game.

But things didn‘t exactly turn out.
After the Panthers finished 3-7-1 in
1984. former head coach Foge Fazio
hired a new offensive coordinator.
Chuck Stobart in his days at Utah had
perfected the rollout offense. Stobart
immediately installed the new game
plan at Pitt. hoping for similar results.

Congemi didn’t bark at the new
system. He worked hard trying to
master it. He failed. Congemi. you see.
is a drop-back quarterback. He is most
effective when he takes the ball from
the center. drops back five yards and
f ircs.

Congemi. under the Stobart system.
passed for only 1.377 yards and six
touchdowns. He passed for nearly
2.000 yards and 16 touchdowns as a

sophomore - when he was a drop--

back quarterback.

After Pitt ﬁnished only 5-5-1 in 1985.
Congemi’s stock had dropped. He no
longer was considered a pro prospect.
In fact. he was considering playing
baseball at Pitt. rather than trying to
hitch on with an NFL team.

“IfI only had one more year. I'd do
it this way or that way.“ Congemi
recalled saying to himself on many oc-
casions. “I didn't want it to end the
way it did. I felt like 1 got robbed last
year.“

Congemi believed if somehow he
could just get one more chance to show
Pitt fans that he was for real in 1983.
he wouldn‘t dare to let it slip away.

Still pondering on what could have
been, Congemi was suddenly given that
one last chance. As a freshman, he
hadn't played a single play and the
NCAA rules say a player who never
appears in a game can be declared a
redshirt.

“Now 1 got that chance to prove
myself again." Congemi said at Fri-
day‘s spring football luncheon.

Things are a little different this year
for Congemi. For starters. he will head

into spring camp not first. but only one
of five contenders for the starting nod.
On the other hand. however. that’s fine

with Congemi because new head coach ’

Mike Gottfried is a firm believer in the
drop-back quarterback.

“There’s no guarantees that I’ll
play." Congemi said. “But coach
Gottfried has said that we'll all have an
opportunity to start. He’s going to keep
an open mind. That‘s good enough for
me.“

Congemi is just more than happy to
get a fair shake. But the next four
weeks are critical as Gottfried has
noted he wants to come out of spring
camp with a starting quarterback.

“I would hope to have a No. 1
[quarterback] before the close of the
spring practice." Gottfried said.
“[Congemi] and four other guys will
have that opportunity and somebody
will be the take—charge guy.”

Gottfried also said at the luncheon
that the “quarterbacks will throw most
ofthe practice time." Congemi's smile
of approval lit up the room.

fried's track record reveals that he is a coach with the capabilities of
achieving those seemingly impossible dreams. Through eight seasons
as a collegiate head coach, Gottfried has built a reputation as one

With a knack for building winners, Gottfried has proven one thing:
he is and has been a success.

He has turned losers into winners at Murray State, Cincinnati and

The Lady Panther gymnasts ﬁn-
ished out their 1986 season with a
win over Clarion University. Pitt
scored 180.85 to Clarion’s l74.l5.

“That was our goal, to get a 180,
and we did it," Pitt head coach
Donna Sanft said. “This was our
most well—rounded effort, a good
all-around team effort.”

The Lady Panthers were consis-
tent on all four events, having to
count only two falls. one on bars
and beam each. According to Sanft,

the scoring started low on vault
with Jackie Calderone and Kristy
Pieters being underscored. Calder-
one scored an 8.7, and Pieters
scored an 8.9.

“But the girls were determined
to get that 180, and they weren't
going to let anything stop them."
Sanft said.

Pitt gymnasts were the top scor-
ers on each event. Alisa Spector
was the high scorer on vault with

last week‘s performance, scoring a
9.25 to win bars. Freshman Trish
Aser took the balance beam with a
9.4. Also, Pieters. a senior, won
the floor exercise with a 9.45.
Waters tallied a personal best this
year to be the meet’s top all-around
performer with a score of 36.6.

The Lady Panthers’ next meet is

will “ ibably go into regionals

For the third straight year, Susan
Hickman has been named an All-
America. Hickman, a junior from
Orlando, Fla., received the honor after
placing eighth in the 50-yard freestyle
in the recently completed NCAA
Championships in Chicago.

Hickman was one of only eight
swimmers to make All—America honors
in the event. She did so despite the fact
that she was seeded 20th at the outset
of the meet. If Hickman can make All-

“Tony Woods will be rushing the

“I am very excited about that

“The 43—front eliminates me from
dropping back into pass coverage. so
I can really concentrate on the quarter-
back now."

Woods will not be the only Panther
making a move this spring. Apke. an
inside linebacker for the past three
years. will move to outside linebacker
now. Fox will search for two players.

Fox will evaluate each. keeping in

“The middle linebacker is kind of
the quarterback of the defense," Fox
said. “You would like to have the best
athlete you can. but you really want a
guy with a lot of football sense." Fox

added. "I can‘t say who that will be 
right now. because we haven‘t been in
pads or a live situation yet."  

Another switch. aimed at tightening
up what was a loose defensive

Pitt‘s leading interceptor last year. with
seven from the cornerback position. As
a freshman. Austin started at free safety
several games.

sophomore Troy Washington. did not
intercept a pass. '

All in all. Gottfried seems to plan on
living or dying with the 43—front. It is
a defense that he used at Kansas with
moderate success.

“We got into the 43-defense about
the third game of the season and played
it well." Gottfried recalled. “We will
basically be a 43—team. Hopefully we
will be able to hang our hat on that and
be successful.“
