Four faces of depression

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

(Editor’s note: This is the second in a three-
part series on depression.)

Rachel knew she had an excuse to see a
mental health’ professional shortly after her
husband of almost 30 years died after a long
illness. She struggled to plough through her
graduate studies at Pitt under the weight of
overwhelming feelings of guilt, suicidal
thoughts and an alarming loss of motivation.
She finally decided to see a counselor at
Pitt’s Counseling Center.

Here, the 48-year-old discovered that she
had fallen into a chronic depression years
before her husband died. But she had never
gone for, help. She had become accustomed
to a certain level of depression for so long,
she thought a counselor would only tell her,
“There’s nothing wrong with you.”

Now, after medication and psychotherapy,
she can look back and see that there was
something wrong. She can now see that it
isn’t “normal” to drive routinely along a
highway imagining how easy it would be to
drive off the road and end her life. Back

then, she thought everyone struggled with
that kind of pain. Now, she has realized that
she doesn’t have to.

V * * *

Part of understanding ‘depression is learn-
ing what it looks like. It attacksin four basic
forms —— dysthymia, bipolar (manic depres-
sion), seasonal affective disorder and unipo-
lar (major depression).

Rachel suffered from the form called dys-
thymia, a low-grade but chronic depression.
Those with dysthymia can still function, but
almost always with the sense of not being
able to reach full steam. After her hus-
band died, Rachel plunged into a major
depression, during which it became, more

difficult to function, to step out of bed in the ‘

morning, to escape suicidal thoughts and the
intense emptiness that comes with a loss.-of
enjoymentin activities thatused to bring
pleasure. .

Dysthymia puts a person at greater risk of
having a major depressiveepisode. People
with dysthymia often don’t seek psychiatric
help, says Dr. Kenneth Nash, who treats
patients at Pitt’s Student Health as well as
through his private practice. They ‘have

A house away from home helps patients

Women's

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

Most people know that Pittsburgh is a
city on the cutting edge of medicine where
people from all over _the world get first-
class medical treatment.
~ But what happens to the families of the
people who are hospitalized for long peri-
ods of time? - S

Family House happens.

Family House residents come from all
parts of the United States and from abroad.
Some are young, others older. Some are
there awaiting treatment for life-threaten-
ing diseases, and others are successfully
recovering from surgeries and transplants."

There are men and women, patients and
caregivers. ’ ' J
Family House is a non-proﬁt corporation
located in Oakland. Actually, there are two
houses and an inn. One of the houses and
the inn are located on McKee Place, and
the other house is on Neville Street. Family
House provides residence to families of
adult patients who must seekvthe care of
Pittsburgh area doctors and hospitals, and
to the patients themselves. It even takes the
overﬂow of children coming from the
Ronald McDonald House, which provides
a similar type of service. .
.- The first Family House on McKee Place
opened in November of 1983, and Family
House became incorporated in July 1986.

The second house on Neville Street opened 0

in 1989, and the inn in 1991. Since then,
Family House has served nearly 20,000
people.‘ .

“Coming to Pittsburgh may be the very
first time the patients have been away from
home,” said Sue Schrenk, director of com-
munity resources.

The patients and families are referred by
physicians, social service and admitting
departments, or they hear of Family House

by word of mouth. When they arrive, they -

find linen service, shuttle buses to the hos-
pitals, their own rooms and private baths
and TV lounges. After a while, the guests
find much more. ‘

“We give them a lot of sup-
port,” said Schrenk.

The residents may come and
go anytime they like, and they
make their own meals, clean
their rooms and do their own
laundry. Thereis no set struc-
ture tothe day.

“They may feel the illness is
controlling their lives,” said
Schrenk. “This lets them take
some control.”

The residents do share the
living rooms and the kitchens,
but this gives them a chance to
meet other residents and share
experiences.

“It’s communal not in the
sense of space but in the sup-
port sense,” said Diane
the House
Manager for the McKee House.
“You see -a lot of friendships.”

Family House does not
receive any federal or state
funding but depends on the
contributions of individuals,
organizations, corporations and
foundations. There are three
annual fund-raisers: a golf tour-
nament, a polo match and a
dance marathon at the
University of Pittsburgh. The
average cost of a room per day
at both houses is $23, and the
inn is ‘$30 for the guest's.
Family House sometimes pro-

, vides financial assistance to

families. .
Family House provides qual-

ity and affordable housing

through the help of volunteers.

' It is operated by a volunteer

board of directors, and there
are fewer than 20 paid staff

positions. The houses are run
by more than 150 volunteers
who work at least two four-
hour shifts per month between
the hours of 10 a.m. and 10
p.m.

Volunteers give the guests
support, directions or advice.
They are responsible for securi-
ty and answering the phones.
While many guests successful-
ly recover from their illness,
the volunteers help the guests
bring closure to a death and
help them move on.

“I like to call them Pitt
ambassadors,” said Schrenk.
“They help the guests to adapt
to the situation, the city and the
house.”

The volunteers work on a set
schedule each week and even
on the holidays. They come
from all walks of life and must
go through 10 hours of training
before they begin. Volunteers
befriend the residents and
become role models.

— Organizations, particularly
student groups from Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon University,
Chatham ‘College I and
Duquesne University, take time
to do painting, cleaning, baking
and holiday parties. Pitt’s
Kappa Psi pharmacy fraternity
even‘ includes service to Family
House in its bylaws.

‘The groups are a lot of fun
to have in, because the guests
enjoy it,” said Beckerman.

Family House is _in the
process of recruiting members

of the Pitt community to partic-,

ipate in the 24-hour dance
marathon on March 22 and 23.

become so accustomed to feeling depressed
that they forget there even exists another
way to feel.

“People who have [dysthymia] don’t come
in for that,” Nash says. “They usually come
in when they have major depression on top
of that.”

Some who have suffered from dysthymia
say that before they got treatment, they
never really knew what it meant to feel
good.

Michael, while recovering from his suicide
attempt at Allegheny General Hospital, felt
he got the help he needed at the time. The

“Sometimes, when I get manic, I don’t

the potential side effects of when I go manic.
I’m afraid that my mood will continue to be
out of control, that no matter what I do, I
have to be careful that it doesn’t' get out of

Bipolar affects about 40 percent of all

stabilizing medication, such as lithium.

and draining energy. Other symp-
toms include excessive crying, loss
of appetite, poor concentration, pas-
sive suicidal thoughts such as ‘life
isn’t worth living’ or a specific suici-
dal plan.

Sometimes, a person will fall into
a major depression after an identifi-
able environmental trigger — the
end of a relationship or the death of
a friend or family member. Anybody
expects to grieve after such events,
but it becomes a mood disorder when
the depression won’t go away. But
sometimes, people won’t have any
idea why they’ve become depressed.

“They don’t know why — they just
know they feel terrible,” according
to Robert Gallagher, head of Pitt’s
Counseling Center. “Some people get
into this, and they feel terrible for a
day or two and they bounce right
back. But when it hangs on,  it’s
important for them to talk with
somebody and get some professional
help to deal with it.”

Though confident in the methods
used to treat depression, psychiatrists
don’t really know what causes it.
Most subscribe to a broad explana-
tion, a combination of things that
contribute to depression called the
biopsychosocial model.

This model presents the probability
that depression results from both a
biological vulnerability and environ-

_ Cahalane said. “How

mental stressors. Doctors say that if
a person has a low biological vulner-
ability, it might take a high amount
of stressors to push them into depres-
sion. But a person with a high vul-
nerability may become depressed for
less apparent reasons.

“Some people have such high bio-
logical vulnerabilities, they seem to
get depressed with absolutely no
environmental causes,” said Jack
Cahalane, clinical administrator for
the mood disorders module at

Western Psychiatric Institute and ’

Clinic. “You ask them, ‘What was
going on before you got depressed?’
Nothing. And you’ll talk to their
spouses. They have a pretty good
relationship, good relationship with
their parents, good relationship with
their kids. They seem to be nice peo-
ple; they’re well-adjusted; there’s no
financial problems.” '

Researchers at Western Psych, a
nationally renowned research center
for depression, are looking at the ill-
ness on a number of levels, including
the biological and psychological
aspects of treatment.

“One of the areas is
understanding the

roendocrine system or any number of
systems —— how are they disturbed;
how are they different when some-
one’s depressed?”

Researchers have found that
depression has a large genetic factor.
Also, they have targeted some spe-
cific neurotransmitters, which send
information throughout the brain.
Serotonin and norepinephrine levels
are lower in people with depression.
Low levels of serotonin are also
associated with impulsive behavior,
aggressiveness and a tendency to sui-
cide.

But the mystery is: Does brain
chemistry cause depression, or is it
the depression that changes the brain
chemistry?

Serotonin is thought to have a
causative role, said Dr. Robert
Howland, an attending psychiatrist
and researcher at Western Psych.
Researchers also suspect that genet-
ics are associated with the sleep dis-
turbances that mark depression.

In an examination of the brain
chemistry of a depressed person’s
first-degree relatives, brothers and

sisters, parents, aunts or uncles, low
levels of serotonin will likely
show up in them as well, Howlarfd
said.

“That would suggest an abnormali-
ty of serotonin to have more of a pre-
disposing causative role in depres-
sion rather than as the body’s
response to the depression.”

There are no simple explanations,
and researchers are still looking into
these areas. They have found some
clues by examining the way antide-
pressants work.

As they investigate medications
that target more specific components
of the brain, such as serotonin levels,
they approach a better understand-
ing.

“All medications that are used we
know work and provide relief and
treatment,” Cahalane says. “So
they’re getting much closer to it. But
that still doesn’t mean you really
understand the basic disease
process.”

beat it. I pushed myself to go
to _class, to finish assignments,
but I could never quite break
through. I couldn’t enjoy the
things I used to. I couldn’t get
enthusiastic about things that

A used to fill me with excite-

ment. I passed up an opportu-
nity to study abroad in France.
I was losing interest in every-
thing.

But I could still accomplish,
and I could still engage myself
in school. So I figured, if this

_ is life, I will learn to make the

best of it.

Until one day I ran out of
things to do five minutes after
waking up, and I knew my
biggest accomplishment that
day would be stepping out of
bed. One week, I sobbed so
hard into the mornings that I
woke‘ up with a swollen face
and a head full of painful
memories I thought I had
buried long ago. One night, I
took about 15 Motrin pills,

ignorant of how many would '
hurt me. But when I opened
my eyes the next morning with
the familiar burden of aware-
ness, I cried in disappointment.
If this was life, I couldn’t live
it.

I succumbed and called the
Pitt Counseling Center, think-
ing this action only proved my
weakness. I would just have to
admit what I had suspected all
along: that there are those who
learn how to will themselves
out of the hurricane. I was just
not one of them.

During my first hospitaliza-
tion, the illness gradually
pulled me from reality into a
place I don’t think I will ever
understand. I couldn’t move; I
could barely speak. Sometimes
I heard a baby crying and com-
plained to the nurse, “Why
doesn’t anyone pick her up?”
When I did speak, with the
words of only a 3-year-old, I
heard a childish lilt in my
voice. So I clung to a sweat-

shirt that Dr. Burrows called
my “blankey.” My eyes often
wandered over my surround-
ings, like an infant unfamiliar
even with itself.

My doctor held my hand and
assured me I wasn’t going
crazy, that the depression had
deepened, that he and the other

going to harm yourself?” he
asked for the hundredth time

The strangeness choked me.
My eyes darted around the

My eyes often wandered over my sur-

members of my treatment team
would help me get better. I
believed him, his gentleness
and assurance often calming
me. But then I began to doubt.
How would I ever get out of
this? I spent days wondering if
the furniture, the people, my
hands were real. On one partic-
ular day, even the sound of Dr.
Burrows’ voice carried no
familiarity.

“Do you feel like you’re

ing me?”

He tried to repeat his ques-
tion calmly, but a horror filled
me. '

“Who are you?” I demanded,
digging my heels into the ﬂoor
to push my chair away from
the man, away from the bodies
that appeared on the floor, out
of this strange room, this for-
eign moment and this alien
life.

where you are?” Dr. Burrows
asked.

“No,” I said and released
more tears than I knew I had.

“You’re at Western Psych
where you’re being treated for
depression. You’ve been here
for a month.” He noticed my
widening, fearful eyes and my
intense effort to push my chair
away.

“What do you see,
K a t h l e e n ? ”

I abruptly stopped crying. I
remembered who he was, and I
remembered his comfort.

“Dead bodies, all over the
floor,” I said quietly, scanning
the scene before me.

I resigned myself to the
vision and slumped in my
chair. My body simply shut
itself down. My struggle dur-
ing the past week to walk,
expending all my energy to
step inch by inch, was over. I
could no longer move.

Dr. Burrows pulled a wheel-
chair out of the closet and
pushed me down the hallway
where I could sit with others.

“Kathleen, you’re going to
get better,” he whispered over
my shoulder with a fervency I
often recapture. “We’re going
to find the right medication for
you. In the meantime, you
have to try your best to pull all
your resources -together.”

He paused, then continued
softly, “The new medication
will help you with the depres-
sion, and it’ll help you move.
You are going to get better.”

I clung to these words. I
clung to these words as I clung
to the memories of my best
friend’s daily visits, before I
had fallen so low, before the
point where I couldn’t stand
for people to see me and my
treatment team felt it better
that even my mother not come.
But she drove from Ohio any-
way. I couldn’t talk, so she
held me and rocked me for an
hour, her warm tears dropping
onto my face. They melted me
and begged for my return. ,

The medication loosened my
limbs, began to lift my depres-
sion to the point where much
of my human function had
returned. As I left the hospital
on May 1, seven weeks after I
had been admitted, Dr.

Burrows warned of the strug-R‘

gle ahead.

“Give yourself time,” he
said.

That night of June 17 -
after the tube they thrust down
my throat sucked out every-
thing that would have killed
me, after the nurse strapped
my arms down during my
attempts to pull out the oxygen
tube that dared give me breath
— a disturbing scene floated
through my restless sleep.

We all stood in line — those
of us who would soon dive
into death. The old and frail
stood before me and boarded
the roller coaster that only
dropped once. Soon they
pushed me forward. They said,
“Go, it’s your turn.” But I
could feel that it wasn’t. My
insides dropped and begged for
another chance.

Burn it, wear it and bear it

Burn, baby, burn. So long, Red, White and Blue, the
law says we are allowed to burn you. The very law you
represent allows us to light you up and burn you into
ashes. Apparently, though, that same law does not give us
theability to refuse to wear you.

Dieter Troster, a guard at the Greensburg State
Correctional Institution, is required to wear an American
flag patch on the sleeve of his guard uniform. He chal-
lenged the mandate all the way to the Supreme Court, but
that cou-rtrecently refused to hear his case. So Troster
must now either wear the patch or lose his job.

Until 1991, the American flag patch had never been a
part of state corrections officers’ uniforms. During the
Persian Gulf War, some of the officers requested to be
allowed to wear the patch as a show of support for veter-
ans serving in the Gulf. In 1993, the request of a few
must have caught someone’s eye, and the patch became a
required part of the uniform.

This might seem an innocuous enough thing, but, as
everyone knows, the symbol of the American flag has a

, unique ability to spark controversy everywhere it

appears. Those unhappy with the United States burn the
flag and are protected by the First Amendment of the

Constitution while doing so (freedom of speech, after _
all), while others want a constitutional amendment out-

lawing flag burning. But until now the Supreme Court
has upheld the right to burn a flag, and an amendment
against it would be a violation of itself.

Troster’s case has an interesting twist. He did not

7 refuse to wear the patch because he was dissatisfied with

the United States, he didn’t believe in the Constitution,
or because he was trying to cause trouble. His reason for
not wearing the ﬂag was just the opposite. Troster was a
major in the U.S. army, and he holds a deep respect for
the flag. He believes, according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette (January 9, 1996) that wearing the flag is disre-
spectful and debasing to the ideals the flag symbolizes.
The Supreme Court is wrong not to hear this case.
There is no difference between a state not allowing a citi-
zen to burn the flag and a state requiring a person to wear

one. This case is clearly a violation of the First

Amendment, since Pennsylvania is dictating a political
statement‘ by requiring that the flag be worn. Ironically,
Pennsylvania is requiring guards to wear the symbol of
protection from state—mandated beliefs, and it is denying

‘that protection at the same time.

‘Troster is not a rebelling dissident. His rights as a citi-
zen of the United States have been violated by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and even the Supreme
Court has refused to help him. -Maybe he should have
torn the patch off his sleeve and burned it. Thenpthe
Court might have listened. But "he has too much respect
for the flag and what it stands for. Too bad, he’1l just
have to wear it with silent objection in honor of the
American ideal instead of torching it.

Ever since I came to Pitt, I’ve
heard Oakland residents com-
plaining about what the expan-
sion of the university has done
to their community. In most

‘cases I.must agree with these

people. A large portion of stu-
dents that aren’t living in the
dormitories are dirty, noisy and
bad for property values. The
result of this is slumlords, ugly
buildings and a falling standard
of living.

Another theme which has
been a constant since my arrival
at the university has been cam-
pus safety. Students are encour-
aged to carry mace, walk in
groups and travel in well-lit
areas. Personally, I would never
encourage someone I cared
about to attend this university.
In fact, I would discourage it.
Had I known then what I know
now, I wouldn’t be here.,Falling
enrollment and/or lower admis-
sions requirements are never
good for an institution of higher
learning, yet this is what will
happen because most people
have a healthy fear for their
lives when walking in Oakland
at night.

Keeping these two ideas in
mind,. is there any reason why
Pitt and Oakland residents

V should be arguing? I don’t think

so. It is the falling standard of
living (which Oakland residents

fear) which creates the crime,

(which Pitt fears). Both groups
actually have the same goal.
The trick is to enable these two
groups to work together to
achieve it. *
Let’s start with the Oakland
residents. They are basically on
the right track. All they want is
a safe and attractive place to
live. At the same time, it is
becoming increasingly obvious
that the university is not going
to stop expanding. It therefore
falls upon the residents to take
action. If you don’t want Pitt
buildings where your house
was, don’t sell your house. This
leaves the problem of students
renting —— and then trashing -
houses. While this is an impor-
tant concern, it is impossible to

ason
urtrs »

stop students from renting
houses. This is America, after
all.

The responsibility for keep-
ing students from lowering
property values falls on the uni-
versity. The reason students
want to move out is because the
dorms suck. If residence halls
were a more attractive place to
live, the desire to move to
apartments would not be so
great. I must admit that there
are some good things about liv-
ing in dorms. There are no
roommate ﬁghts about bills and
someone cleans your bathroom

every day. For most people ,

though, the bad far outweighs
the good. Being a dorm-

dweller, I feel qualified to offer.

three examples of reasons why
people move out.

1.) Guest passes. I can under-
stand why we can’t just let any-
one in the residence halls. I can
even understand why Pitt stu-
dents who live off campus must
be signed in. But why do you
have to be signed into one dorm
if you live in another? What
difference does it make whether
the campus police have the sus-
pect list narrowed to 500 (the
number of peoplein one dorm)
or 5000 (the number of people
in all the dorms)? My home-
town police (which are proba-
blyabout as good as the cam-
pus police) had _3OO million
possible suspects but’ still man-
aged to solve most crimes.

2.) Bag checks. I was shocked
to see that the guards now
reserve the right to check any
bags we bring into our
“homes.” How many rights is
this violating? Would you move
into a place where your land-
lord checked groceries or laun-
dry before you were allowed to
enter? Thank goodness we have
Big Brother Pitt protecting us
from the dangers of alcohol.

3.) Forced meal plans. Would
you move. into a place where
your landlord added several

Apartment solutions for Oakland    

thousand dollars to your rent for
the “privilege” of being forced
to eat what he cooked‘? And, of
course, to ease the transition,
freshman get forced into higher

meal plans. I know I managed '

to ﬁnd my way to McDonald’s
well before my sophomore
year.

While these problems may be
detrimental to life” on campus, I
really don’t expect them to be
fixed. What I can .hope for is

_ that a great deal of thought will

be put into the decision to build
new residence halls. The major-
ity of (people who move out of
the dormitories move out of
their own free will. What we

need is a new and different type.

of building.

What I propose will be sinn-
lar to a university-run apart-
ment building. It will consist of
mostly suites and singles.
People living there won’t be
subject to bag checks, RAs,
RDs or meal plans. The only
thing remaining from the older
dorms are the guards to watch
the door and the housekeeping
services. This combination

allows students to take full '

advantage of‘ the posit_ive
aspects of residence hall life but
allows them the freedom which
living in an apartment would
offer. *

The end result of this scenario -

would be more students living
on-campus. This would result
in a better campus for several

reasons. One has already been

explained. Without students
destroying property values,
hopefully a better class of peo-
ple will inhabit our community.
Another is that-with more stu-
dents closer to Central Oakland,
there is less danger of people
being accosted on the long walk
home. A third benefit is the
additional revenues that Pitt
would gain by having students
pay rent to the university rather
than to private citizens. I hope
this gives the university deci-
sion makers something to think
about.

Euthanasia, Mike Tyson and small market baseball teams

Euthanasia allows individuals
‘stricken with debilitating diseases
to die gracefully. It’s a difficult
decision made harderby the gov-

- emment’s extension into the lives

and deaths of individuals. Assisted
suicides have facilitated the deci-
sion for many people, allowing for
a painless, medically supervised
death. By giving the ill the deci-
sion of where and when to die,
they’re able to pay bills, say their

goodbyes and tie up loose ends. "

Most importantly, assisted sui-

_cides offer those stricken with
debilitating illnesses one final

decision which they can make
themselves. Questions about
morality are always raised, but the
Bible’s ban on suicides is hard to
justify in a country that separates
church and state. Still, there are
those who want to take the ﬁnal
decision of the dying away from
them and put it into the hands of
lawmakers. Dying with dignity,

therefore, becomes a secretive

attempt to break the law in order
to live one’s ﬁnal hours in com-

_ plete control of one’s own mind
V and bowels..

' The name of Dr. Kevorkian is
synonymous with assisted sui-
cides. He’s done more to help peo-
ple than his critics have "done in
their lifetimes. Still, his garish
demeanor and morbid profession
have done little for the public rela-

tions field of assisted suicides. As

Southern Republicans court big government

Far and away the most

angry critics of “big govern- -

ment” tend to be middle-class
southern Republicans. The
current Republican leadership

' is overwhelmingly southern

and very much ‘committed to
taking a meat cleaver_ to the

..government’s largess. But

who benefits from our taxes
the most? Is it the people who
live in the cities and need fed-
eral handouts like welfare and
food_ stamps to support them-

selves? The answer is no. The

people "who actually receive
the most benefits from the
federal government are 

middle-class southemers.

An excellent way to gauge
how the government spends

. its money is to examine where

exactly this money goes and
how much a state pays in

‘taxes and how much it

receives in services. New
Mexico, for example, receives
$1.96 in services for every
dollar it pays in taxes. No
other state gives less in taxes
and receives more in benefits.
In contrast, New Jersey
receives 67 cents in services
for every dollar it spends in
taxes. No state pays more and
gets less. Where do southern

. states rank? Of the top five
‘ states that receive far more

money than they pay, three
are r -southern. One,
Mississippi, is the home state
of Senate Majority Whip
Trent Lott, a fierce critic of
government. The average fed-
eral tax bill‘ for a resident of
Mississippi is $2,975.

Connecticut, which, like New *

long as Dr. Kevorkian is the
spokesman, assisted suicides will
never have the mass appeal they
deserve. However, there is hope.
Americans need a reason to rally
around assisted suicides so that
lawmakers get off the backs and
bedpans of those wishing to die. I
have a proposal for this.
Combine euthanasia, Mike
Tyson and small market baseball.
Mike Tyson is the" most mar-
ketable boxer since Ali. He’s fast,
strong and intelligent.
Unfortunately, his career was side-
tracked by a prison sentence. His
absence from the ring only aug-
mented his popularity, or at least
stimulated a massive interest in
seeing him fight again. His ﬁght
against Peter McNeely ended in
less than two minutes, yet Tyson

still earned $25 million. The bot- ,

tom line is that people will pay to
see Tyson ﬁght, no matter who his
opponent is.

We live in a violent -society
where people pay to see blood.
Unfortunately, the Tyson ﬁght was
cut short because McNeely’s man-
ager disqualified his fighter.
Millions were disappointed, and
judgement on Tyson’s boxing
abilities was inconclusive without
proper closure of the fight. Well,
since Tyson needs more practice,
and since he’s used to fighting
stiffs anyway, how about ‘Tyson
fighting an almost stiff? That’s

 

Evan
Gallahou

right, Tyson should ﬁght people ’

suffering from incurable diseases.
Since they want to die, no one
would jump into the ring to stop
the fight. Tyson would get his
tune-up, those who want to die
would get their wish, and the pub-
he could spend their money on a
pay—per-view bloodbath knowing
they wouldn’t be disappointed.
Think of the market for this ﬁght!
Not just blood, but death!
Everyone loves watching vio-
lence! What family doesn’t share
a good laugh watching the
Zapruder Film or the Rodney
King. beating?

The rules for the ﬁght would be
sirnple-none. The ﬁght could end
only when Tyson’s opponent died.
If his opponent is unconscious,
someone could hold him, (or her)

up while Tyson continues punch— .

ing. In order to make this as pain-
less as possible, the opponent

Jersey, has a — _ ‘end of the

has a typical
tax bill of $7,105. Fair?
Certainly not. Of the top 10
states that pay the most in
taxes, none are from the
south. As a matter of fact,
seven of the 10 states that pay
the least in taxes are southern.

Of the three countiesin the
nation that receive the most
money from the federal gov-
ernment, all three are in the
south. One, Cobb County in
Georgia, is the home district
of Newt Gingrich himself.
Also located in Gingrich’s
district is a major Lockheed
defense plant. In fact,
throughout the south there are
an average of 12 military
bases per state, a figure 50
percent higher than that_of the
rest of America. It isn’t sur-
prising to note that the much
discussed Republican
“Contract with America”
includes a provision to
increase America’s spending
on our military.

A disproportionate number
of southern Republicans sit on
the defense and appropria-
tions committees, and these
members have found creative
and inventive ways to funnel
money into their districts. In
this year’s budget, $243 bil-
lion is appropriated to the
an

last year and $7 billion more
than President Clinton asked
for in his budget. So much for
the “peace dividend” that the

provide.
While the GOP’s “Contract
with America” pledged to
spend the increased money on
troop readiness, the defense
budget actually increases the
troop readiness budget by a
mere 1 percent over President
Clinton's proposal. The
Republicans are doing little
more than throwing the
money into wasteful projects
that the Pentagon, an institu-
tion not noted for its frugality,
has frankly said it doesn’t
need. Take, for example, the
$1.3 billion that Congress is
appropriating for a helicopter
landing ship to be built in the
state of Mississippi, the home
of Senator Lott and Senator
Thad Cochran, the chairman

of the Senate Defense
Appropriations
Subcommittee. ’ Also,:

Congress is spending $974
million on an amphibious
assault ship built in New

‘Orleans at the very shipyard

where Congressman Robert
Livingston, the very powerful
chairman of the
Appropriations Committee,
once worked. The
Republicans are sacrificing
defense readiness, -a crucial
problem that needs immediate
attention so that they can
spend money on their own pet
projects that the Pentagon has
told Congress aren’t needed.‘
Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York point-
ed out to southern lawmakers

would be injected with morphine,
cocaine and codeine before the
ﬁght, and the post—ﬁght drug test
would be waived

For those that find this cruel, let
me remind you that Tyson’s oppo-
nent would get his or her 15 min-
utes of fame and a final wish,
while the families would get a
small percentage of the gate which
should help cover funeral expens-
es. I’m sure Tyson would be
happy to autograph a pair of box-
ing gloves for the grieving family.

So, what does this have to do
with small market baseball teams?
Revenue sharing. No one wants
another baseball strike, especially
people with incurable diseases.
Yet, "with no agreement reached
between the players and owners,
another strike is conceivable. I
propose that since Tyson would
get so much money fighting
invalids, and since he would be

honing his boxing skills for a

lucrative championship match, he
should give a percentage of his
salary to small market baseball
teams. With the extra money,

_ small market teams could court

high-profile free agents, thus
increasing interest in their teams,
which would result in higher
attendance and rejuvenated con-
cession sales, Posters of Tyson
ﬁghting a grandma with an uncon-
trolable bladder or a grandpa with
no limbs would be sold with half

during the debate over the
budget that the Tennessee
Valley Authority, which sup-
plies critically needed elec-
tricity for much of the south,
was built with money from
New York. Without the dread-
ed federal government, none
of the critically needed roads,
bridges and airports that have
been vital to the emergence of
the southern economy would

. have been built; none of the

federal programs that enable
poor southerners t.o crawl
above _the poverty line like
Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid and even welfare
would have existed. Without
Franklin Roosevelt’s New
Deal, the south would be a
poor, agrarian society instead
of the vibrant, high-tech econ-
omy it is today.

The GOP’s desire to cut the

federal government is hypo- 3»

critical, and the public needs
to put all of this talk about
cutting the federal govern-
ment into the proper perspec-
tive. The poor actually
receive very little benefit
from the federal government.

,Welfare checks account for a

mere 1 percent of the federal
budget. Add in food stamps,
and this number climbs to just
3 percent. Nobody has bene-
fitted more from “Big
Government” than its own
worst critics: middle-class
southern Republicans like
Newt Gingrich.

VVith greater interest and enthusi-
asm for teams like the Pirates,

We must look beyond the
apparent cruelty of this proposal.
Euthanasia is good and shouldn’t
be practiced as though it were a
crime. People should be allowed
to die how and when they choose.

This doesn’t mean that getting _

killed by Mike Tyson is for every-
body; it isn’t. However, with
Tyson needing more practice and
with people killing themselves
everyday and not getting anything
for it, there is a market for
euthanasia performed by Tyson.

Tyson and small market baseball
get more money and" the
American public gets happiness

works for everyone. And of
course there’s the victim. It’s so

cotics so the end is painless.

or even the greatest

to win a game on the
road. It’s even more diffi-

Perhaps the only thing that can stop Allen
Iverson and the No. 5 Georgetown Hoyas
right now is the weather.

The Hoyas (l3—l, 3-0) were scheduled to
play Pitt (6-3, 1-1) last night at the Civic
Arena, but couldn’t make the trip due to the
blizzard. The game has been rescheduled for
7:30 tonight at the Civic Arena.

Georgetown, riding a l0—game win streak,
is fresh off an 85-76 victory over Big East foe
Seton Hall last Saturday. The Hoyas were
once again led by point guard extraordinaire
Iverson, who tied his career—high with 40
points. ‘

Iverson, a 6-foot sophomore, is the main
reason for Georgetown’s return to national
prominence, much like it was in the 1980s.

But don’t be fooled, this Hoya team is
much different from years past. Before, veter-
an head coach John Thompson centered his
coaching philosophy around his endless sup-
ply of big men. With the likes of Patrick
Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe
Mutombo blessing the middle, Thompson’s

‘offense thrived on shoving the ball down low

and let the centers do their thing. Thompson’s
defensive philosophy was much the same. -—~
very physical and crash the boards. a

More than two decades later Thompson has
scrapped his 24-year-old bully—ball style and

«moved towards the more popular run—and-gun

style of play.

The reason for Thompson’s change of heart
is simple: he has Iverson. .

Questionably the quickest player in colle-
giate basketball, Iverson now holds the reigns
to Georgetown’s success and the wins are pil-
ing up as fast as his NBA expectations.

Currently the second leading scorer in the
Big East behind Connecticut’s Ray Allen,
Iverson comes into tonight’s game averaging
a hefty 22.5 points a game and 6.2 assists.

A month-long break from
competition didn’t seem to
hurt the Pitt men’s and
women's track teams at the
West Virginia University
Invitational meet last week-
end.

“With bad weather all
over the East Coast, it made
training over the break
hard,” coach Steve Lewis
said. “But we didn’t go
backwards, and that’s all we
can ask for.”

In fact, there were several .

outstanding performances,
most notably that of Najuma
Fletcher. Only two days
after returning from her first
trip home in a year and a

half, Fletcher won the triple ,

jump with a jump of 42-7
1/2, which qualified her for
the NCAA championship
meet. Fletcher had previous-
ly qualified for nationals in
the high jump andthe 55
meter hurdles.

“She got to spend
Christmas with her family
for the first time in four
years, then she came back
with "no practice and per-
formed-well,” Lewis said.

The women dominated
several events. Ayne Allen,
Joetta Purter, Gennifer
Williams, Tonya Mullins
and Naeemah Withey took
second through sixth place
in the 200 meter. Mullins,
Williams, Shana Fadis,

The break may have actu-_

ally helped Pitt. ' _
“Some of our injuries are

starting to heal,” Lewis‘

said. “Quality is our forte.
We don’t have a lot of num-
bers, but everyone con-
tributes to the team. Not
having a lot of depth means
we can’t afford to lose any-
one.”

“Our middle distance run-
ners are starting to come
around. Scott Gilpin had

been injured and it’s good to V

see him back.”

Lewis said the team needs
to workon it’s relays before
their next competition in
New Jersey for the
Princeton Relays.

Iverson can not only domi-

defensively as well.
Averaging almost four steals
a game, he has 22 more steals
than anyone in the Big East.
Iverson also led the confer-

' ence in steals last year, which

is why he won the Defensive
Player of the Year honors.
But the Hoyas are definite-.
ly not a one—man show._ They
have the size and depth to
make serious noise come
March.
' Othella Harrington, a 6-9,
240—pound center, was sup-

. posed to be Thompson’s next

low-post gem. Coming out of
high school in Mississippi,
Harrington was touted as the
No. 1 player in the country.
After averaging 16.8 points
and 8.8 rebounds a game as a
freshman, Harrington was
already being compared to
Ewing. But after two
mediocre years and the emer-
gence of Iverson, Harrington,

a senior, has seen his role

Captain of the Hoyas’ all-

rounds out Georgetown’s

Over the holiday break,

named Pitt’s new offensive
line coach. He previously
held the same position for

the Canadian . Football

D’Alessandris, 41 and a,

the year it finished 10-0-l.

about the opportunity to
join the University of
Pittsburgh football pro-
gram and work with John
Majors, for whom I have
great respect,”
D’Alessandris said in a
press release. “Pitt has
always been a first-class
institution and I am look-
ing forward to being a part
of the tradition.”

offensive guard at Western
Carolina University.
During his senior year in
1976 he was team captain
and most valuable player.

He remained at Western
Carolina as a graduate
assistant the following
year to begin coaching.
And after two seasons, he
was named offensive coor-
dinator and offensive line
coach at Livingston
University, where he
remained from 1979-84.

“We’re very excited
about having Joe join our
staf ,” Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors said in a

coaching expertise that I
think will be very benefi-
