Summer
Openings
Down  

By LINDA MILLER

Finding a job this summer may
require determination, comprom-
ises and miles of leg work on the
part of Pitt students.

According to spokesmen from
the University Placement Service,
the number of students inquiring
about summer and part-time work
has increased by five percent, while
the number of jobs the service posts
has decreased byil0 percent com-
nared to last year.

“It’s hard to predict the summer
job market because the labor
market has been depressed in such
a wide-spread way." said Robert
Hopkins, director of the University
Placement Service. “Companies
may not be hiring full-tiine now
because the nature of the work does
not warrant it. But the work may
warrant liiritig suinnier help."

The increase in the number of
students registering with the Uni-
versity Placement Service can be
attributed in part to the cutbacks in
student‘aid. —

The $13 million renovation
of Schenley Hall is progressing
ahead of schedule, according to
Student Activities Director
Andy Smith. ~

“There is a chance student
organizations will begin reoc-
cupying their new offices on the
third and fourth floors in the
beginning of June,” said
Smith, a major contributor in
the re-design of Pitt’s Student
Union. “The second phase will
begin in late August or early

September when we move the
offices on the first and second

floors downstairs."

Working eight‘ hours a day
for five days a week, for the past
two months. workmen demol-
ished the insides of the third
and fourth floors and are now
putting up new walls, instal-
ling new windows and a
sprinkler system, and updating
the plumbing and electrical
systems. i

lSchenley Renovation Update

Opened in l898 as the Schen-
ley Hotel, Pitt’s Student Union
served as the social center for
Pittsburgh’s visiting and (‘stal-
ished elite at the turn of the cen-
tury. Guests included Enrico
Caruso, Lillian Russell and
President Woodrow Wilson.

When the renovation is com-
pleted in l983, Schenley Hall
will incorporate the character
of the 19th century with the
practicality and sleekness of the
21st, according. to Smith.

“A number of students have reg-
istered with us because they realize
that summer work study programs
are being cut back to almost
nothing,” said Julia Laird, a conni-
selor with the service.

Both Hopkins and Laird aiitici—
pate a much greater increase in the
number of students registering if
the proposed cuts in financial aid
become real i ty .

“We're the logical alternative to
student aid and work study," said

in the number of students regis-
l(l”(‘(l' is notthat significant, it
could be the beginning of an
onset." _
As more students compete for
fewer summer jobs, a number of
students will be forced to settle for
any kind of job they at get.

said Hopkins. “You're going to
find more students holding part-
time jobs during the school year."

According to Laird. the largest

n timber of summer jobs the service
has posted are for camp counselors
and am useinent park workers.’ But
even these jobs, which are tradi-

summer could prove to be a plus in
the experience column. according
to Hopkins.

‘Students Revitalize

A committee of concerned
students at Pitt is currently try-

Mortar Board is Omicron Delta

To apply for membership in

junior with at least a 3.0 aver-
age. Members are selected on
the basis of their academic per-
formance and extra-curricular
activities. The society began as
an exclusively women’s society
but, since 1975, acccepts male
members as well.

Pitt junior Clare Watt and
senior Pam Baughman are in
charge of the efforts to revitalize

Mortar Board. They contacted

its national office and are cur- -

rently working to find out what
situation (financial and other-
wise) the Pitt chapter was left in
when it became inactive. They
are trying to gather all of the
information they can so the
society can become active again
next fall.

“For next fall, were mainly
interested in establishing our
organization at Pitt again and
gaining membership,” said
Watt.

Possible Mortar Board activi-

ties include volunteer work in
the community and assisting in
university programs that need
student help, Watt said.

Anyone interested in helping
to re-establish Mortar" Board
should contact the Office of
Student Activities at X5877.

Campus
Trends

As journalists, we spend a good deal of time identifying,
writing about, and some would even say creating, trends.
Not necessarily trends confined to the standard definition
of the word, such as the latest fashion styles, but psycho-
logical, philosophical and political trends.

As a result of identifying those trends, we also take a lot

of heat for what some readers describe as bad publicity or My

biased coverage. In Monday"s New York Times, for exam-
ple, Jose’ Napoleon Duarte, president of El Salvador’s
junta, said that the Central American situation—not just
in his country—was being l)lOWI/1 out of proportion by the
international press.

Now, while we can hardly consider ouselves influential
members of that so-called international press,~we nonethe-
less, by publishing stories and opinion about El Salvador,
contribute in some small way to the overall perception of
the situation and the subsequent policies that develop.

Closer to home, however, there are some important
trends worth noticing, trends which we as students have
created. ~

Without a doubt, there is a trend toward conservatism
on this campus. Not the same political conservatism asso-
ciated with organizations such as The Moral Majority and
other groups, but one particularly applicable to college
students. It is more of a curricular and social conservatism,
demonstrated by the growing awareness of many students
that in order to succeed in our future society, they will have
to focus their. energies on economic and financial goals
rather than social concerns.

Dear Editor:

From your account of Professor
Robert Newman’s honors program
‘lecture (“Prof. Predicts Witch
Hunt") of Feb.~~l8, it appears he has
failed to use his skills in anal-yzing
the mind of the conspiracy monger
on himself. His entire lecture
appears aimed at convincing us
that there is a right wing “hard
core” of Americans conspiring to

mobilize witch hunts against liber-  f

als. The tactics he uses to convince
us of this are typical: e.g., treating

Senators‘ McCarthy and Gold-_

 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  

liberals.)
Conspiracy hunting is moti-
vated, from left or right, by a failure

NewrnanFai|s on‘Witch-Hunt“

to treat people as individuals with V

a vast variety of reasons for sup-
porting their political (and other
sorts of) actions. « .

It is helped along by smearing by
association, treating radically div-
ergent political positions as identi-
.al, and finally by compelling

it arguments like the following of

Professor Newman’s:

., “If espz'0n_age were really this

 

water, and the Moral Majority as massive surely theRussian.s by this

For example, where there were once protests at Pitt the poljm-3| representatives of 4;, L__ 

concerningfar-away wars in far-away places, tlioseipro-s
tests have been largely replaced by serious debate and
discussion about student aid and the uncertainty of educa-
tional assistance. These, unlike previous protests over
such topics as the legalization of marijuana, incite real
fear in students; fear of the future, of their careers aiidof

the loss of lifestyles they have grown used to.

It was that fear that caused between 5,000 and 7,000
students to march on the Capital Monday, the same fear
that caused over 200 high school seniors to attend a special
session at Pitt last month on how to beat a Social Security
aid deadline. .

By the same token, this growing campus conservatism
has led to more students setting thei_r goals on personal
rather than collective ends. This is not to say that personal
goals should be sacrificed for the collective good, ,it’s
merely a trend that seems to be occuring on this campus.

<-- So whereas before, a great many studetis organized

themselves in tight-knit cohesive organizations with defi-
nite goals, fewer and fewer of these organizations are being
formed, while the one th' t do exist lack the influence for
swaying university policy that they once did. The Student
Government Board is a prime example of this trend, much

A of it a result of docile administrations with more concern

over not making waves than encouraging campus-wide
change.

While it's‘ easy to criticize students for their cotnpla-

cency, it should also be noted that activism often comes as.“ 4.

the result of a moral injustice‘, such as the Vietnam wai.
The conservative trend of this country and this campus
will undoubtedly remain until shaken by growing
international and national injustices.

(Senator Goldwater is, of course,
an outspoken opponent of the
iMoral Majority and a defender of
First Amendment freedoms.) In a
similar vein, Newman tells us
about those, like the authors of The
Spike, who are alleging an attempt
on the part of the Soviet Union to
systematically control the Western
media. But he‘ immediately warns
us of a “disinformation crusade," a

Reagan’s ‘Nice Guy’ Image Not Issue

Dear Editor:

Let's quit the attempt to estab-
lish whether or not Ronald‘ Reagan
is a “nice guy.” T_liis is not the

issue. Instead, we should examine *

whether his policies offer ati effec-
tive and proper response to the
nation’s ills.

Bruce C. Riley certainly believes
in Ronald Reagan (letter to editor‘,
Feb. 24). It is praiseworthy that he
has exercised his freedom to write
an editorial letter. However, when
he bases his argument on worn-
out, unfounded and unsubstan-
tiated slogans that come straight
from a John Wayne film or a Jolm
Foster Dulles speech, it is proof
that the writer’s knowledge of the
facts is dubious at best.

Riley “believes” that 50 cents of
every dollar spent on federal pro-
grams is “abused." If he wants to
talk of abuse, he should start with
large corporatiotis‘ massive abuse
of the system. It has apparel y
“escap'ed" Riley that most crimi-
nologists zrgree that white-collar
crime costs society much more than

policy-makers realize this fact, the
nation will be continually

embroiled in no-w_in situations.
“The sobering lesson of Viet-

nam” should clearly demonstrate
this‘ fact. Ho Chi Minh asked for
American, not Russian, assistance
first—despite his Marxist beliefs.
Out of ideological fanaticism, our
government decided to sacrifice
50,000 men in order that a corrupt
regime could rule a tiny, insignifi-
cant country.

Riley should get out of his

paranoic, Cold-War mentality and
quit sweating over the “spread of
communism.” His clamor fo

arms, arms and more arms at tli r

expense of social programs
reminds one not of a democrat like
Thomas Jefferson, but of Her-
mann Goering’s absurd yet mem-

orable satement: “Iron makes the '

people strong, butter makes them
fat.” ..

Crime on Campus

The Inside Story:

Crime on  ampus

Crime on college campuses these
days is almost as big an issue as
crime in the streets. .

Like all universities, the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh has its share of

‘ crime-related problems.

“Crime is either the commission
or omission of. an act regulated by
statutes,” explained Lt. James Wat-
ters‘, the assistant director for
administration of the Department of
Public Safety. -

Watters, and members of the Uni-
versity Police Department “try to

’ provide the very best service they

can” by patrolling around the clock,
seven days a week, on campus.

“We have 56 uniformed officers,
five plainclothesmeri, three detec-
tivés, eight uniformed supervisors
and about 12 administrative staff
members,” Watters said when des-
cribing the University Police. Fifty‘
percent of the force is college edu-
cated, which Watters said is “five
times the national average.”

The “modern” campus police
evolved in 1970 as a reaction to
some of the turbulent times on col-
lege campuses during the 1960s.

“The primary mission of the cam-
pus police is to protect university
students and personnel, their guests
and visitors to the university and to
protect the university property,”
Watters said.

In addition to the above, they pro-
vide a range of supplementary servi-
ces including:

1. Prevention, detection and investi-
gation of crimes. ‘

2. Parking assignments and control.
3. Emergency ambulance service.

, Patrolmen R.L. Waters and Ted

344 elvuuﬂtsnfa

The Pitt News, Wednesday,- March 3, 1982

4. Security services for students or
university events. ‘
5. General service and assistance to
university personnel.

6. Locking or unlocking doors late at I

night.

7. Notification of personnel in emer-
gency situations.

8. Providing information to visitors
or guests.

The university campus police
operate ambulances and marked
and unmarked cars that are
equipped with emergency and
safety equipment.

Other safety devices are the red
emergency telephones located
throughout the university area. If a
telephone is used, the. call imme-
diately signals the police headquar-
ters. There are 125 of these red
telephones on campus. They are
located at:

Crawford Hall - Outside

There is another type of emer-
gency telephone system that was
designed by the university.

“There are seven push-to-talk
phones,” Watters said. “The
phones are two way speakers and all
you do is press the bar onlthe
speaker which activates a compu-
ter. Then we have voice transmis-
sions through a two way speaker.”

.. l , :  .l"‘.§‘.:.:I
 of “B” Patrol do their best to provide safety for

” This is one f the seven, push-tk emergency phones,

located on campus.

When talking about reported
calls, Watters said, “We actually
responded to over 15,000 calls of
which 1,700 were criminal in nature,
and 13,300 were service in nature.”

Examples of service calls are:

' assisting in traffic, letting faculty into

their offices, assisting in activities
and responding to fire alarms.

“We offer a wide variety of servi-
ces above and beyond some of the
basic responsibilities of law enforce-
ment functions,” Watters said.

What are some of the types of
crimes that occur on campus?

“By in large, each year the crime
of theft accounts for 43 percent of
reported crimes on campus,” Wat-
ters said. “Students leave their
rooms open for a short period of
time while they go out, then they
come back and find that something
has been removed. Females in the
library leave their purses while they
go to the book stacks, then they
come back and find their purses are
gone. Individuals who utilize the
Trees Hall facilities leave lockers
unlocked when they’re even in the
shower only 30 feet away and theft
occurs.”

“The people we pick up who com-
mit these kinds of crimes know the
habits of the people they’re victimiz-
ing,” Watters said.

Besides theft, summary crimes
are committed on campus. Exam-
ples of summary offenses are public
intoxication, disorderly conduct

and criminal mischief. , ~

“We average somewhere around
20 physical assaults a year,” Wat-
ters said. An example whould be a
“freshman who had too much to
drink and gets into a fight.” Watters
said the university police assist in
separating the fighters.

Another problem on campus is
offenses related to femalevictims.

“lndecent assaults and indecent ‘

exposures are. examples of these
moral offenses,” Watters said.

Narcotic violations and harass-
ment of communication are other
types of crime on campus. '

How are the University Polic
notified when a crime is committed?

“The vast majority of crimes are
reported to us by students, faculty
and staff calling us,” Watters said.
“Other crimes are discovered by
officers on patrol who observe
crime in progress; or, they find the
evidence of a crime that has been
committed.”

The University Police follow cer-
tain procedures when a crime is
reported. After a call is received, the
radio operator at the campus police
station notifies the police.

“The number of police that are
sent out depends on the seriousness
of the crime,” Watters said.

crime is made. A specialist then col-
lects all the evidence: fingerprints
and photographs for general pro-
cessing. A detective obtains all the
information of the crime offender,
and a crime analysis is performed on

“of the law have their conduct

reviewed by the criminal justice sys-
tem. Also, a criminal complaint is
filed through the court system and
the judicial board on campus,” Wat-
ters said.

According to Watters, crime at
Pitt is not as big a problem as on
some college campuses.

“We are average or below aver-

age as far as the reported crimes on .

campus,’’ Watters said.

Not all college campuses are for-
tunate enough to report average or
below average - crime rates. The
crime problem is especially acute at
the University of Southern
California.

@‘ “Violent crime on the USC cam- ‘
- is

us has increased 150 percent in the
past four years, according to an arti-
cle in the Jan. 25, 1982 Newsweek.
“Last fall alone," reported the arti-
cle, “There was a murder, two
rapes, five attempted kidnappings
and 15 armed robberies.”

“No campus or university is free
of crime,” Watters said. “But out of
the 40,000 students and faculty
attending Pitt daily, less than 100
crimes are committed against per-
sons each year,” Watters said.

How many crimes on campus are
solved?

“Typically, we clear about 35 per-
cent of crimes against persons. We
clear overall crime at a rate of about

.. 24_percent,”Watters said. ‘
l”’*~The University Police arrest

crime offenders only as a last resort.
“Many more contacts with our
force end favorably,” Watters said.

Safety Tips -

0 When you go out, use caution
and stay alert. It could mean the
difference between a pleasant trip
and a nightmare.

0 Arrange to have someone with
you when you are walking at night.

0 Plan your route and use well-lit
streets.

0 Walk on the curbside away
from buildings where an assailant

.\-‘could conceal himself.

0 Don’t stray away from the well-
traveled. path or take shortcuts
through alleys. ’

0 Don’t have that one drink too
many. Criminals look for victims

_ whose defenses may be impaired by

alcohol.

0 If you think you areibeing fol-
lowed by someone on foot, change
directions or head for a store or a
group of people.

. 0 If you are on foot and think you
are being followed by someone in a
car, change directions, cross to the
opposite side of the street or head in

the opposite direction on a one-way

(The following is a true story as
told by a Pitt student.)

It was 8 in the evening and I
was going to meet with a profes-
sor whose office is located in a
rather remote area of Pitt’s cam-
pus. I would have preferred
going to see him during the day,
but his afternoon office hours
conﬂicted with my class sched-
.ule. I didn’t go alone; my room-

_mate had volunteered to go

along.

Two males were walking
ahead of us‘, innocently enough,
or so we thought. They stopped
and sat down on the steps lead-
ing to the building my roommate
and I had to enter. As we passed
them, one of the men grabbed
my purse. I didn’t let go imme-
diately. I couldn’t believe some-
one was actually trying to steal
my purse. I had my student ID,
wallet, room keys and many

other important items in it.

The other male grabbed my
arm, which caused me to let go
of the purse. For the first time I
realized, that they might have
been armed. I tried to talk them
into taking the money and giving

  -it   

Student Warning

were probably wondering why I
didn’t just run’ away. At that
moment, my roommate
screamed and the two muggers
ran off with my purse.

My roommate and I couldn't
believe what had happened. We
didn’t know what to do or who to
call. We ran into a Pitt building
and called the campus police.

The police took a report from
us that night and then drove us
back to our dormitory. The next
day we went to the police sta-
tion, looked at mug shots and
helped compile a picture of one
of the assailants.

- The mugging was more than
just a frightening experience~—it
was a major inconvenience. I had
to get a new ID, room key and
different lock to put on my door.

' Some of the things that were in

my purse could never be
replaced, such as photographs
and small souvenirs I had col-
lected during a recent trip.

_It has just been two years
since l’ve been mugged. I have
gotten over the mugging itself

and everything that was in it.
That was the easy part. The one

people you don’t know. A lot of
people take unnecessary risks,
and when people aren't cau-
tious, all the security in the world
can’t help them. ,

taught me to be much more
cautious.

Do your part and don’t make
crime easy.

Don’t walk alone at night. If
you must walk somewhere at
night, go in a group.

If possible, don’t carry a purse

If you must carry a purse,
don’t keep any valuables in it.

If a crime is commited against
you, immediately run to an emer-
gency campus phone and pick it
up. The phones are located all
over campus. ’

Try to remember what the
assailant looked like. It will give _
the police a better chance to
catchhim or her.

If your ID and/ keys are stolen,
go to the housing ofﬁce and
make sure you have a] police
report with you to verify that the

The end of the swimming season
is approaching for those men’s
Eastern Regional qualifiers who
will not beat the NCAA National
Championship cutoff time tomor-
row through Saturday at Pitt's
Trees Hall Pool. \

Regardless of what place a
swimmer finishes, if he doesn't
beat the NCAA's tough time stan-
dards, his season is over. And while
some events will probably fail to
qualify any Eastern swimmers. Pitt
senior Rick Carter should have no
trouble making it to Nationals-—of
his six events, the Panther standout
is likely to qualify in live.

Carter clocked the fastest free-
style times in the East last year as a

jiinior at the Eastern Rt-gionals at

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Maybe a new rule should be
incorporated for Pitt-Duquesne
games. Just throw out the first 39
minutes of the game. Make it a one
minute game. For, no matter what
happens the game always seems to
come down, to the last 60 seconds.
No difference last night in Pitt’s
highly emotional, highly-
physical 66-64 win the first round
of the Eastern 8 tournament.

The scene at the Pitt Field House
was an all-too-familiar one.
Duquesne had the ball with 25.
seconds to go, down by two, at 66-
64. The Dukes’ pressure defense
had led them back to this and now,
a chance to tie.

‘‘I thought with my heart that
this game would go into overtime.
And I thought we could win it in
overtime,” losing coach Mike Rice
said.

‘‘I was scared to death that the
game would go into overtime,”

winning coach Roy Chipman of
Pitt sighed.

But Duquesne fell prey to the I-

doii’t-want-to-blow-it syndrome.
“It looked like none of their

players wanted to take the last

shot,” Pitt’s Clyde Vaughan said.

Guard Tom Cvitkovic’s driving
shot hit off the front rim into Terry
Teachout’s hands. His long-range,

off-balance shot was off-target.
Duquesne’s season was over.

“You have to give credit to their
kids. When we were up by 13, they
could have‘ folded and nobody
would have thought anything of it.
They didn’t and they kept on fight-

ing back," a somewhat relieved
Chipman said.

The Dukes fought back against a
Pitt team that controlled the offen-
sive boards, and against a Pitt team
that stuck three men on senior cen-
ter Bruce Atkins and always made
sure an elbow was firmly
implanted in his chest, or a white
uniform was there to keep him off

the glass. Atkins would end with
just five rebounds.

“We didn’t lose the game
because of the layups we missed.
We lost the game because we didn t
rebound. We were just standing:
around,” Rice said.

In the last meeting between the
two teams, a 69-68 Pitt victory,
nobody checked Andre Williams
and the freshman was able to tap in
a missed Dwayne Wallace-shot to

win the game. Williams once again .

spelled doom for _the Dukes as his
rebound and subsequent lay-in off
a Clyde Vaughan free throw miss

was the difference.

“That was a very big play. The
kids were tight at the end. The foul
shots weren’t going in and Andre
was at the right place at the right‘
time.” Chipman said.

All night the Panthers had been
in the right place._ Rebounds came
their way, loose balls gravitated
towards them._The game early on

continued on page seventeen

Atkins De

His final game didn’t do him
justice. Duquesne's Bruce Atkins,
the man that had tangled so memo-
rably with ex-Pitt star Sam Clancy,

"the man that had terrorized Pitt for

four years ended his college career
at the Pitt Field House, of all pla-
ces, in defeat.

Sure, he scored 19 points. Sure,
his mere presecne warranted the
attention of three Pitt players. But
somehow, Bruce Atkins deserved a
better fate than he got as the Dukes
fell 66-64 last night.

His final season was a forgetta-
ble one. Rarely did the same four
players surround him. Rarely did
the team string together two wins.
And yet, Bruce Atkins endured
even when his coach complained
that he wasn’t firing up the team.
Rumors sprang up that Atkinsand
his coach, Mike Rice didn’t get
along. Others said the 6-9 senior
was overweight.

Bruce Atkins never ‘ was the
leader type. Ask him and he’ll
admit it. He tried though. He
shaved his head for the first Pitt-
Duquesne game. “Didn’t want to
do anything bizarre,” he said.

Professional, quiet he always
was. Atkins preferred to let his
playing do the talking. In four

years, I_5_ruce A-tkins’ play did a lot.

It's an all-new medley relay,
except for Carter. Carter calls the
team “the best relay I've ever swam

individual events, as well as in the
relay, from Bergan.

The Panthers second man off the
blocks is breaststroker Sandy Pid-
geon. Pidgeon set a new Eastern
record as a junior last year in
breaststroke and went on to
Nationals. Pidgeon is also the most
powerful—yet—versatile man on
Pitt’s team. His 400-yard individ-
ual medley performance last year,
which set a record, established Pid-
geon’s~dominance in Eastern
swimming.

season , other teams should not be
deceived.

Due to fewer dual meets this’sea—
son, Lewis has adhered to a strict
game plan—-workouts right up to
every dual meet. The Panthers have
also been doing Friday and Satur-

giate Athletics for Women

Regional Championships run_

through Saturday at Harvard.

“Easterns and Nationals are a
culmination of the hard work we
have put in this season,” Pitt
Coach Dave Belowich said. “lt’s
nice to see the team jell now.
They‘ve worked well in the water
and should swim well.”

Although the Lady Panthers
may perform up to their potential,
this will not necessarily ensure
them of regaining the Eastern title
they lost last year to Princeton. The
Lady Tigers‘ better team depth
could dominate the lower place
finishers and the largest share of
points.

“We have the potentialto beat

them, but we have a difficult task
‘ahead of us," Belowich said. “We

need to overcome their front-line

people, have our people finish
within the top eight, and have

swimmers from Penn State, Brown

and Harvard finished ahead of

» Princeton."

The Lady Panthers must be
ready mentally and physically for
the pressure-packed. grueli-ng
three-day meet. Preliminaries
begin at ll a.m. and finals start at 7
p.In. A competitor is allowed to
enter a maximum of seven events-
four individual events and three
relays. If a swimmer qualifies for
the finals in all seven events, she
would swim l-1 races within the
three-day period.

“We have to be in very good
physical condition going into the
meet, and we are," said Belowich.
“We also have to be mentally ready
to swim well."

Several Lady Panthers will be
swimming at or near the severi-
event limit. Co-captain Julie Ter-
rell is entered in seven events, while
Sue Heon. Jan Ujevich and Amy
Jackson are each entered in six
events.

Regaining the Eastern crown is
one of Belowich's team goals for
the meet. He realizes that Lady
Panthers have to “swim the best
we've ever swam at Pitt," if they

” hope to topple Princeton. “Several

Pitt records must fall," he added.

If the Lady Panthers don’t come
up with their best times. then the
probability of the Eastern swim-
ming title returning to Pitt is
unlikely. he memory of Princet-
on's whopping 27,-point regular
season win over the Lady Panthers
still stings.

The Lady Panther swim team may need record-setting times to regain the Eastern
Regional title Princeton won from them last season.

Swimmers Losing Reigns ?

By BARRY ZASLOFF

For the past six years.‘ Panther
swim teams-both men's and
women’s—have breezed through
competition at the Eastern Region-
als, while resembling something
out of Jacques ()ousteau’§ tinder-
water adventure and casting a
dead-fish appearance upon their
opponents. 1 V

The men’s team has, for the last
six years, claimed the title of best
swimmers in the East. To win, it
merely had to show up. The Lady
Panthers were not far behind, fin-

ishing first or a close second several“

times.

But there is reason to suspect that
both teams——an abundance of tal-
ent not withstanding—-will fall
prey to other water——creatures in
this year’s Eastern Regionals this
T hursday, Friday and Saturday.

Pitt hosts the men’s championship
at Trees Pool, while the Lady
Panthers visit Harvard.

2 Despite outstanding swimmers
gind record breaking performances,

A the men’s team has struggled to a

disappointig 2-3 dual meet record
this year. Its lengthy reign at the
top of the East may well be
snatched away by divers in the air,
rather than swimmers in the pool.

The Panthers entered this season
with three divers, but two of them
have since quit, leaving Rex Nord-
heimer as the lone diver. The other
two, coach Fred Lewis said, "just
burned themselves out mentally.”

The difficulty of the task ahead
now rears its ugly'face above water.
How does a team enter Eastern
Regionals with one diver and
expect to compete with learns who
will amass 100 points from three or
four divers? Remember, Nordhei-

students of the social sciences.

'mer is the lone (liver, not the Lone

Ranger. Even if he were, there it;
still no Tonto.

’ “W e’re going to need some help
from the weaker teams,” Lewis
answered. Our only chance is to
finish high in all of the swiming
even ts and hope that the strong div-

'ing teams like West Virginia and

Maryland windup well behind us
in those events." ,

Lewis estimated that the Pan-
thers_will lose about one-sixth of
their total points from the diver
tteliciency. “It has been that way all
year,” he said. If it wasn't for our
diving, we’d be 5-0 instad of 

“Our swimmers have done
everything that could beiasked of
them,” he continued. “They've
turned in their best times ever this

year and have broken several pool \

records. But it’sawfully difficult to
make up a 100 point deficit.” A

‘The Lady Panthers, owners of a
5-3 dual meet record, face a similar
task. Only 12 swimmers and two
divers have qualified for Eastern
Regionals, whereas defending
champion and arch—rival Prince-
ton earned the right to send 20
swimmers and four divers.

"It's a tough situation," coach
Dave Belowich said. “Our front
liners must win their events, and
we need help from other teams to
spread some distance between us
and Princeton.”

‘‘I usually go into a meet with .1

positive attitude," Belowich co -

tinued. “But Princetonhas alreaq,
defeated us once this year, and we
are really outnumbered. We have to
be considered a big underdog this
year." ‘

Penn State and West \'irginia
have both turned i11 sortie powerful
times this season. A month ago. the
Panthers traveletl to West \'irgit1ia
where they found the .\lountain-
eers \'er\_; rested. W\'l"s two fastest
men had even .slld\t:Ll their heads.
All this was done in the hopes of
beating Pitt. West Virginia did
win, but how will WVI’ do against
Pitt at l:Iasterns—at Pitt?

Pitt will have a big edge with
their first sliave. West Virginia
knows this and can counter it with
team depth and a powerful diving
team. This will be the key to East-
erns this weekend.

Carter will swim the same six
events that he swam last year and
will probably do just as well as he
did last year. It will be the Pitt
swimmers that take the rest of the
Hi places that will get Ritt those
extra points they" need. Lewis
knows it, as does his whole team.
West Virginia, Maryland, Cleve-
land State, Penn State. . .they'll all
be there in full force.

Whose force is strongest will be
determined when the three days of
swimming at Trees Hall Pool con-
cludes Saturday night. But one
thing is certain, Lewis and the
Panthers will be out not just to
defend their Eastern title but also to
send the largest team from the East
to this year's Nationals.

To Heon, Swimming
EA Moving

By'SCOTT omen

Last summer, Pitt . Lady
Panther swimmer Sue Heon
considered taking a break from
the rigors of swimming, but
Fred Lewis, coach of the men’s
team and the Pitt Aquatic Club,
persuaded Heon to continue the
tortuous training associated
with the sport. The reward for
her perseverance: a trip to
Europe this January represent-
ing the United States in two
international meets.

Heon qualified for the team
by finishing in the nation’s top
eight in the 400-yard individual
medley. Since a swimmer can
only participate in two foreign
trips a year, Heon declined a
tour to New Zealand last year to
wait for opportunity to chal-
lenge the world's best.

Despite the offer of a trip
most people—athletes and non-
athletes—only dream of, Heon
had some doubts about going to
Europe during the middle of
Pitt's dual meet season.

“I didn’t wanttto hurt the
team or nnr coach by leaving in

the middle of the season," Heon
said. “The only reason I went
this year was because I turned
down a trip last year.” ‘

Why would someone want to

turn down a chance to perform .

against the world's best? The

answer lies in Heon’s assess- ,_

ment of her performances her
freshman year at Pitt.

“I didn’t have a good year,”
said Heon-, who still managed
to earn All-America honors in
the 800-yard freestyle relay. “I
had a lot of adjusting to do-—
not having a family telling you
what to do. I had a hard time
budgeting my time.” ,

Heon h\as made plenty of
adjustmentsduring her swim-
ming career.- The Clarktown,
Pa. native went to a high school
where the swimming program

‘was not a priority. S

“The coach of the team was
‘just a teacher from the high
school,” Heon said. “Mr. Dick
Bradshaw (former Lady
Panther coach) sent me and om”-
ers who were serious about
swimming programmed
workouts.”

Last night he whispered.

The frustrating ll—l5 season
ended in well, frustration. Bruce
Atkins was marked—ever try to
shoot the ball with three men
guarding you? No wonder Atkins
tried twice to throw away Pitt p.lay-
ers from his side in last night’s
game. »

“I ('ouldn’t get the ball with
three ‘players around me,” Atkins
explained. «

There was bitterness, or disap-
pointment in his voice. ,,

“There should have been two
men open, but we weren’t taking
high percentage shots," he
lamented.

‘V Still, Atkins kept his under-
manned team in the game. A
After falling behind early by as

much as 10 points, Duquesne
would fight back as Atkins scored
11 second half points. With 25
seconds left and the score 66-64, a
win was within reach. But, in the
end it was it mirage, like so many
games before.

“All season», we lacked confi-
dence. Nobody wanted to take con-
trol at the end. Nobody wanted to
win it,” Atkins said.

“We're used to these kinds of

games. We’ve lost eightof them.
It's just the .way the season has‘
gone," said Dukes Coach Mike
Rice whose job is rumored to be as
safe aswalking in Central Park at 4
a.m.

A kind of season with an unkind
ending that sent a tear streaming
down Bruce Atkins’ cheek. _

‘‘It’s time to fold up this shirt
and put it in my drawer,” Atkins
said softly.

at home was a difficult one for
Heon, but she does not regret it.
"It was a give-and-take

,thing,” Heon said.'“I had a goal

to reach. My parents’ under-
stood that I may never have that
opportunity again.”

The hard decisions and work
paid off as Heon made the Uni-
ted States team by finishing sev-
enth in the 400-yard individual
medley. Heon admits that she
“was surprised by making the
team.” ‘

Picking a college was an eas-
ier decision for Heon than her
high school move was.

“I didn’t consider going any-
place else but Pitt,” Heon said.
‘_‘People going to a new coach
or program take two years to
adjust._I felt secure staying here
under Mr. Bradshaw. Also, Pitt.
gave me a good offer for a
scholarship."

Ironically, Bradshaw gave up
his coaching duties after Heon’s

freshman year and Dr. Dave,

Belowich took over. Heon

 

OMMUNIC

believes his entrance into the
program has helped her.

‘‘I have been swimming
really good so far thanks to
Coach Belowich's training pro-
gram," Heon said. “I like town
and lift weights (things that
Belowich has introduced to the
training program).”

Belowich believes I-Ieon's
strength as a swimmer is in her
highly competitive nature and
her willingness to do anything
to improve.

“She is a very competitive
swimmer,” Belowich said. “She
_is one of the hardest workers I
have ever had. She brings a lot
of intensity into the pool.” ,

Belowich has also introduced
the mental aspect of swimming
to Heon and this has improved

her times.

“I never -used my mind in
swimming as I have this year,"
Heon said. "Coach Belowich
has taught me how to set goals
and achieve them. He has also
shown me how to split down
my times to the tenth of a
second."

“She is swimming better than
she ever had,” Belowich said.
“Her success has given her tnore
confidence. She wants to
accomplish more."

One goal Heon didn’t have
was to be elected captain of the
United States team on. her
recent trip. Heon admits she
was surprised she was elected.

“It was a great honor to be

‘ captain,” Heon said. “I felt

someone who had more expe-

rience on these things would
have been elected."

Heon performed her duties
both as a swimmer and captain
well. She-cut her personal best
time in the 200-yard freestyle

« and came close in the 400- and

800-yiard individual medley.

The trip has also given Heon
a new test for swimming,
according to Belowich.

“She has more enthusiasm
now since the trip than before
she left,” Belowich said. “The
trip showed that she can swim
with the best in the world,

which is excellent for her
confidence."
Heon has three types of

goals-—-goals she. wants now,
goals she would like to achieve
in the near future, and distant
goals. .

“My short-range goals are to
qualify for Nationals in the rest
of my events at Easterns,” Heon
said. “My intermediate goal is
to improve my times at Nation-
als and finish in the top eight.”

Her long-range goal is tar-
geted for 1984; making another
U.S. team, this time to the
Olypics in Los Angeles.

‘‘I would like to make-the
Olympic team, but that is a
long ways off,” Heon said.

With her enthusiasm and
willingness to work hard, Sue
Heon seems likely to reach any
goal she makes.
