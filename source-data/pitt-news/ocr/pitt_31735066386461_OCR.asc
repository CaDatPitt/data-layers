Maintenance union delays Trees’ riﬂe range repairs

By Leo Hoh
Smﬂ‘ Writer

Although various groups on campus like the Panther
Pistol and Riﬂe Club, campus police and ROTC depend
on the riﬂe range at Trees Hall to increase their shooting
accuracy, the range has been closed for over five months.

The only thing standing in the way of the range being
repaired is the maintenance union at Pitt, according to
T om Lester, president of the Panther Pistol and Riﬂe Club.

“I guess the union is worried about getting a piece of
money it will take to repair the range. Everyone is
concerned with making money on this deal, and only a
few factions on campus are interested in getting the range
repaired,” said Lester.

Author urges aid

to Soviet Jewry

By Jenna Ferrara
sum" Writer

Chaim Potok was worshiping
in a synagogue during a visit in in
the Soviet Union in 1982, when
an old Soviet Jew appeared,
seemingly out of nowhere, and
tugged on his sleeve.

The old man said, “When you
go back to America, tell them that
they hate us here to the bottom of
their very souls.”

Potok, a historian of Judaism
and the author of novels such as
The Chosen, was the keynote
speakeryesterday at a program
sponsored by Exodus: The
Campaign to Rescue and Resettle
Soviet Jews.

SovietJews have recently been
allowed to leave the country;
most are ﬂeeing virulent anti-
Semitism and immigrating to
Israel, according to Potok.

“The Jews are right to leave a
country whose whole history has
pointed to a single direction: to
make Jewish life miserable,” said

Potok.

“I’m a writer of stories, and I’m
going to tell you some stories
tonight about RussianJews,” said
Potok.

“Early in the last century a
Russian Jew decided that he had
enough of Russia —— its czar, its
xenophobia.”

That RussianJew ﬂed to Poland
and “because he lived on the
bank of a river, he took the Slavic
name for river or stream: Potok.
That man was my great-
grandfather,” he said.

“Who among us has not heard

similar stories? The wanderings

of Russian Jewry are the ongoing
saga of our time.”

Any efforts that the Jews made
to be accepted in Russia were
met with hostility, Potok said. If
they tried to become assimilated
into Russian culture, “they were
seen as a potential source of
contamination of the ‘pure
Russian soul,”’ he said.

“The final ﬂight is being

told the club in May that the range had to be shut down.

Bill cited the university’s neglect to remove the built-
up lead that caked up against the backstop and became
a solid mass of lead. This lead needs to be pried off to
prevent bullets from ricocheting off the backstop, he
said.

The sand trap, the place where a bullet supposedly
lands when it ricochets, has collected a lot of lead dust.
This dust is kicked up when bullets are fired at the targets
and needs to be removed. The ventilation system needs
additional duct work to allow the ventilation fans to carry
this lead-filled dust out of the building.

“Our members offered our time to repair the range, but
the university denied us permission, citing that such
maintenance work may fall under the university

source that repairing the range would cost $70,000, but
T om assured the universityathat such a job should at most
cost $10,000. Since then, the university has been more
cooperative in its negotiations to get the range repaired,
T om said.

Tom Hussey of facilities management is acting as a go-
between to determine whether the repair of the range
truly falls under the maintenance workers’ contract.

On Nov. 9 an independent estimate of the cost of
repairing the range will be taken by a certified National
Riﬂes Association inspector. He will report his findings to
Hussey, Tom and the other officers of the riﬂe club.
Hussey will take this proposal to the maintenance
workers’ union.

By Joel Garrett
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
was named one of the Top 200
educational best buys in the
United States by Money
magazine’s College Guide 1990.

Money evaluated over 1,000
schools and placed Pitt among
the Top 100 public and Top 100
private schools in the nation that
deliver quality education at a
reasonable price. Pitt ranked 93rd
among the public schools.

“This validates the efforts of
the administration to keep costs
down,” said Tim Ziaukas, director
of communications for University
Relations. “Students want to
know, ‘How much is this going to
cost me?”

Statistical analysis was used to
make the evaluation. Moneyused
17 measures of academic
performance to determine how
much each school might be
expected to cost, then compared
the results to the actual costs at
each college or university.

Performance data that could
be compared fairly from school
to school included: monies
devoted to student instruction,
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores
and class rank of incoming first-
year students, and students who
go on to their doctoral degrees.

Schools whose academic-
performance scores indicated a
below—average education were
eliminated. Those that charged
less than their “expected” cost
scored highly, while those that

charged more were ranked lower.

To create the most consistent
basis for cost comparison, each
school’s full tuition rate was used
because financial ai'd and student
eligibility vary from school to
school. Public schools were
assessed at out-of—state charges
for rating consistency; therefore,
Pitt and the other public schools
that qualified provide an even
better deal for in-state residents.

Barbara Baker of University
Relations said, “This is a feather
in Pitt’s cap.”

Six years ago in Richard Mole’s
The Public I1/ys, Pitt was named
as one of America’s best public
undergraduate universities
because students are “getting a
first-rate education without
paying Ivy League tuitions.”

‘Apes’ dribble away .
for Cancer Society

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Staff Writer

Monkeys can be taught to use sign language. “Apes” can
dribble basketballs.

As part of its philanthropic project for the semester, the Alpha
Epsilon Pi fraternity sponsored its second annual dribble-a-
thon for the American Cancer Society yesterday in front of the
William Pitt Union.

“We’re trying to make it a tradition. I started this last year. This
is our main philanthropy project of the semester,” ‘said Rob
Miller, an AEPi member.

Howard Walper, an AEPi member, said, “It’s a goal of every
pledge class to have a project. We decided to do this.”

“The pledges set this up," Miller said. “We all work on it
together, though. It’s not just the new brothers.” 0

Last year over $700 was raised for the American Cancer

Society, according to Miller.

Student run buses offer cheap alternatives

By Tonia Caruso
For The Pitt News

With the increase in the cost of

gasoline and the price of several A

national modes of transportation
rising, some Pitt students are
offering less expensive, student-
run bus trips to go home for
Thanksgiving.

“I decided to organize a trip
because I thought it would be a
great way to make some extra
money while at the same time
provide students with cheap,
alternative transportation,” said
junior Bryan Bruder.

Bruder is organizing a trip to
Harrisburg and Philadelphia and
charging about half of
Greyhound’s $85.30 round—trip
price. He still expects to make a
profit.

“I think so many students sign

up for this trip because it is a
cheap alternative. The price of
flying is very expensive.
Greyhound has nearly doubled
its price, and the train is costly
and takes forever. This is a lot
more convenient because it leaves
right from the [William Pitt Union],
so students don’t have to travel
downtown,” he said.

Sophomores Ted Schremp and
Stacey Gilmartin are organizing
their own trip to Philadelphia.

“I took a student bus trip last
year, and it was a pretty good
way to get home, so _I thought
about doing one myself,” said
Schremp. “I just went through the
phone book and called almost
every bus company in there until
I found the best price.”

The cost of renting a bus varies
from $1,500 to $2,100, he said.
Schremp, who is charging less

than half the price of Greyhound
fares, explained that the costs of
the trip include other expenses
such as tipping the drivers and
paying for advertising.

“I wouldn't say organizing a
trip is a lot of hard work, but it
does take up time,” said Schremp.
“The hardest part is that there’s
always messages on the
answering machine, and you end
up playing phone tag with all
these people.” A

Schremp said that he and
Gilmartin need to sell about 10
more seats to fill their bus. “We
don’t think we’ll have a problem
filling the bus because the trip is
still five weeks away,” he said.

Freshmen Beverley Schwartz
and Shari Victor need only two
more students to fill their bus,
which will travel to Harrisburg,
Valley Forge and Lansdale, Pa.

Victor said that she thinks their
success is due to more than just
the amount of money students
are saving.

“The main reason students ride

with us is because it’s cheaper. .

Another reason is that it’s a lot
more fun to travel with friends.
There’s going to be a bus full of
46 kids going home for
Thanksgiving break. I think tl1at’s
a lot more exciting than taking a
Greyhound bus with people you
don’t even know.”

Doug Pastor, a freshman from
Lansdale, is one of the students
who will travel on Schwartz and
Victor’s bus.

“A bus is really the only way I
can go home without my parents,”
said Pastor. “I reserved my seat
early because I knew it would fill
up fast. I know about 10 people

Playhouse

By Eric Hoch
Stajf Writer

Twenty years ago, after hearing
rumors of a ghost in the Rockwell
Theatre of the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, Wayne Brinda, a
technician for the Playhouse,
and three women held a seance
on the stage ﬂoor.

What they saw next was the
shock of their lives.

“We looked out in the theater
and noticed that all the seats
were filled by modernly dressed
people,” said Brinda. “And most
interestingly was a ﬁgure pacing
back and forth behind the last
aisle on the main ﬂoor. It was

dressed in a black monk’s robe '

and remained hooded the whole
time. We didn’t see it for very
long because we were taken over
by an impending feeling to get
out of the theater as fast as we
could. When we went back in to
check later, it was gone. And all
the doors were locked. No one
could have gotten in during that
time.”

Brinda left the Playhouse in
1972 and returned in the late '80s.
At this time several students told

technician

him that they had seen a hooded
ﬁgure who would pace back and
forth, faster and faster, until it
became a red glowing ball that
would fly all over the theater.
They called it the Screaming Red
Meenie, and Brinda believed it
was the same thing he had seen
in 1970.

Another ghost was seen by
Brinda’s friend one night when
the two of them were hanging
lights in a very small theater room
on the second ﬂoor of what used
to be the room for the German
Club.

“I had left to take a break, and
when I came back, my friend
looked very startled. He said he
was working with his back toward
the rear end of the room and felt
a need to turn around,” Brinda
said.

When he did, he saw a bride
holding a gun in her right hand
down by her side, Brinda said.
His friend turned away when she
started to raise the gun, and when
he looked back again, no one
was there, according to Brinda.

“Other people who had seen
this ghost identified it as the Lady
in White,” he said.

said. “It works out better for me

learns to lioewit/9 friendly ghosts

Brinda has had other ghost
experiences at the Playhouse
besides the time he saw the
Screaming Red Meenie.

In the Hamlet Theatre, on the
other side of the Playhouse,
Brinda and some of his friends
saw hundreds of white shapes.
This was shortly after he had
taken part in the seance in the
Rockwell Theatre.

“The ghosts were all over the
theater and were very non-
threatening, almost welcoming,
as though neither side was
bothered,” Brinda explained.

Not all of Brinda’s ghostly
encounters involved his directly

seeing a ghost.
“Many times I saw things
moving that had no reason to
move,” said Brinda. “For example,
I was working backstage, and I
noticed that one of the black
curtains that lined the back wall
of the stage started to move back
and forth. This motion spread to
the other curtains until all of
them were violently shaking. “No
fans were on; no one was behind
the curtains. There was nothing
to account for what I saw.”
Also, some of the ghosts
appeared to be helpful, according
to Brinda.
One night he and some students

were painting a set for an
upcoming show,gand they all
took a break. They left their
brushes and paint on the stage,
and when they returned, they
were very surprised.

“More of the set was painted
than compared to when we had
left. Even those among usuwho’
were skeptical could not account
for this phenomenon,” said
Brinda.

As for experiencing recent ghost
sightings and seances, Brinda no
longer bothers.

“I just don’t have the time
anymore," he said.

Investment club plays game with stock market

By Leo Hoh
Staﬁ“ Writer

The Pitt Investment Club has been
rejuvenated from its three-year stagnation
because the experience that can be learned
from such a club “was too valuable to let
go,” said Kenton Brandt, president of the
club.

“People hear the word investment and
think of the club as a bunch of highbrows
who bore each other to death. Our club is
functioning as fictitious investors who buy
and sell stock, while gaining valuable
experience of how the financial market
really runs,” said Brandt.

The Pitt Investment Club consists of 30
members who learn about such things as

long-term investment, short-term
speculations, brokerage firms and stock
options.

The club meets biweekly and picks a

research team to investigate a particular
company through the College of Arts and
Sciences Business Library and returns the
following week to report on its ﬁndings,
said Brandt.

“Last Wednesday, we were researching
on whether or not to invest in USAir
stock," said Brandt.

If the club decides by a two-thirds vote
that it wishes to purchase the stock, the
presenter continues to research this stock
and keeps the club informed on how the
stock is performing.

Speakers are also present at meetings —
anyone from one of the club's officers
speaking on certain issues of investment
(like vice president Tom Anderson
speaking on short selling), to having
various brokers attend the meetings, s_aid
Brandt.

“We had a broker from A.G. Edwards
talk to the club about what the function of

a stock broker is and what all is involved
in his job,” said Brandt.

“Two weeks from now we are going to
have the president of the Westinghouse
evaluation committee come in and tell
how corporations finance various
businesses and discuss commercial papers,
another type of investment,” said Brandt.

Brandt said that every semester the club
has a stock-market competition in which
it gives $100,000 in mock dollars to anyone
who wants to compete. For eight weeks
they invest the money in any stocks they
choose and follow the stocks’ progress for
eight weeks. The top three people are
awarded prizes.

Brandt was asked to be the go-between
for the University of Pittsburgh and the
AT&T National Investment Challenge. The
AT&T Investment Challenge is an
investment game where each player is
assigned a fictitious brokerage account of

$500,000. The student calls a toll-free
number to buy and sell stock. The entry
fee to play the game is $50.

Brandt suggests the game to everyone
because it helps the students to develop
short—term selling techniques, to learn
how transactions between investors and
brokers work and to see how the stock
market really works.

If a student is unfamiliar with how the
stock market is run but still has an interest,
AT&T provides a toll-free number for the
student to call brokers who will explain
how the process of buying and selling
stocks works, said Brandt.

Brandt hopes that the university can get
50 people into the game because if the
university does better than average, Pitt's
name would be printed in USA Today. So
far only 21 people from Pitt have signed
up for the game.

because of fraud

Student discounts on Port Authority Transit tickets have been
eliminated results of a PAT study showing fraudulent use.

Before January 1990, students could purchase student passes
called U-tickets. The study found that non-students were using
the tickets, which were obtained through students. Twenty U-

Research also showed that students are a minority of PAT

Debra DeCourcy, assistant manager of media relations for
PAT, said, “We found [that we were] providing discounts to
students and not to the majority of the riders.” She went on to
say that 80 percent of the riders were not getting a discount of

PAT has revised the discounts to include all riders in Zone 1,
which includes students. Books of 10 tickets are available at the
William Pitt Union ticket office for $10.

Other colleges and universities have varying bus-ticket
discounts. Penn State University offers a town-loop bus ride for
only a quarter. Bruce Yunkin, manager of Fleet Operation, said,
“The [service] is heavily used [so] that there is no real discount.

At Temple University, students may buy a three-month pass
to ride as many times as needed. West Virginia University has
a Personal Rapid Transit, which is paid for by tuition fees so that
students can ride as often as they want.

Student artist refuses NEA

By Kristene M. A. Bondi
Staff Writer

For the past three years, Rane
Arroyo, a graduate student in Pitt’s
English department, has declined
invitations to apply for National
Endowment for the Arts grants.

“[1 have] worked for several art
organizations who have suggested
[the NEA grant] and offered to
help me obtain it. They have even
offered for me to work through
them, but I don’t want to be

funded by them," Arroyo said.
He believes that the NEA only
helps those artists who are already
established.
“There is no money for
development of art," he said.
Arroyo, who is Puerto Rican,
said the NEA’s practice of only
helping established artists made
it more difficult for him and other
minorities to develop their art
because of the lack of money.
Now that he is established

Arroyo said he does not want
NEA money.

Arroyo disapproves of how the
NEA deﬁnes “art.” He believes
that the NEA, which will fund
Shakespeare visits to inner-city
schools but will not fund rock ‘n’
roll, should not make a judgment
on what it considers “real culture”
as art and “folk culture” as
something other than art.

LAC exposes misconceptions

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staff Writer

You don’t have to be Spanish
— or even speak Spanish — to
join in the fun of experiencing
Latin American cultures, and you
won't even have to leave campus.

Annabelle Conroy, president of
the Pitt Latin American Club,
invites Latin American students
or any student with an interest in
Latin American cultures to share
in the activities, which she called

both social and educational.

“The membership is about 50-
50,” she said. “Half of us are Latin
American [natives], and half are
Americans interested in Latin
American culture.”

The club is planning a series of
lectures, films and social events,
which were announced at its first
annual meeting Thursday.

The films, according to club
adviser Shirley Kregar of Latin
American studies, provide
material for spirited discussions

that take place after the
screenings. Very often, said
Kregar, the films are full of North
American misconceptions and
outright errors about life in Latin
America.

“A film may show a typeof
animal that lives only in tropical
zones crawling around in the

Andes [Mountains], which is
hilarious,” she said.

  Program stresses
‘ behavioral change

By Aimee Wolﬂnger
Staﬂ" Writer

Sophomore Amanda Stuitevant
has been working out four times
a week in order to lose 20 pounds
because of an organization’s
weight requirement. However,
after two years she has maintained
the same weight; so she is looking
toward Pitt’s “Take it Off and
Keep it Off’ weight-reduction
program for extra help.

“I came here to see if they
could give me some extra hints,”
said Sturtevant.

Pitt’s health-education office
sponsors the program for Pitt
students free of charge. Irene
Dunny, a registered nurse
working with the Student Health
Service, runs the program on a
volunteer basis.

Dunny begins the hour with
1ow—impact exercises, and toward
the last section of the program,
there is a peer group where the
participants can discuss any
problems.

“I stress student participation,”
she said. “I don’t want to stand
and talk for half an hour. Once
the girls get to know each other,
they talk freely, and some even
join together for recreational
activities.” 9

Instead of giving students a
prepared diet, Dunny gives them
pamphlets and a calorie counter
and lets them make up a diet on
their own.

“I talk about the importance of
the four basic food groups and
give them ideas on what makes
up a healthy diet," she said.

Dunny has students keep a
daily diet diary. She checks it
every week and makes comments
on what they are doing right and
wrong.

"1 stress that they consume a

better quality of food and a smaller
quantity,” she said. “Instead of
grabbing chips or a candy bar for
a midday snack, I want to see
them eating fruits and vegetables. ”
Dunny also stresses the
importance of exercise. She
encourages students to exercise
at least three times a week for a
minimum of 20 minutes.
“Anyone can starve themselves
to lose weight, but their
immunities go down. I want them

to have good eating habits while A
maintaining a healthy lifestyle," v

she said.

Every week Dunny gives her
students a behavioral task.

“The behavioral tasks are things
like slowing down their eating or
eating fruits and vegetables rather
than foods high in fat content,”
said Dunny. “Fat may be very
satisfying and pleasurable to eat,
but we need food for energy, not
as a reward.”

Sophomore Amelia Shadding
decided to join the program for
support.

“I thought it was a good idea. I
need a support group to help me
lose this weight,” she said.

Students compete to cover class schedule

By Jennifer Spiro
sum‘ Writer

Two hundred dollars and having their
designs displayed on the cover page of the
class schedules were incentive enough for
Karen Larson, Stephen Pajewski and Nadya
Sustache to submit their artwork into the
registrar’s office art contest.

“I did [the work] over the summer and
forgot about it,” said graduate student
Larson. Her sketch of the wrought-iron gate
inside the Cathedral of Learning will decorate
the winter—term class schedule.

The three winners received their checks
yesterday at a luncheon held in their honor.
The artwork of one of the winners will

decorate the cover of the class schedule
each term.

College of Arts and Sciences adviser
Pajewski will help his summer advisees
choose their‘classes from a class schedule
containing his cartoon of the Pitt Panther
waiting to get from downtown back into
Oakland, with the personified buildings on
campus waiting in the background.

Pajewski got the idea from his thesis. “I’m
studying images of art  images of
skyscrapers in paintings, like skyscrapers
in Manhattan. New York City artists use a
lot of buildings. I thought, why don’t I bring
these buildings to life?”

Sustache, a senior in chemical
engineering, created her submission over

last year’s winter break.

“I saw a picture of the cathedral and was
home over Christmas vacation with all my
materials,” Sustache said. I

The artwork was judged by a panel of
five judges who are all involved in art, said
Madalyn T umer-Dickerson, assistant to the
registrar.

“The judges choose by what appeals to
them. They look at the artwork. They look
at whether or not it encompasses all the
students,” Dickerson said.

According to Dickerson, only about 20 to
30 students enter the contest each year.

The contest, which is held annually,
accepts submissions until the summer and
is open to all registered students.

NEA is censoring," he said.

Even though Arroyo has chosen
not to use NEA. grants, he sees
nothing wrong with artists, such
as the late Robert Mapplethorpe,
who wish to receive this type of
funding.

“I was not surprised at the
charges, but I was surprised at
the verdict," Arroyo said of the

-recent Cincinnati trial in which

Mapplethorpe’s photos were
charged with being obscene.

Though Arroyo was upset that a
court could decide what art is, he
was impressed that a jury of
people with no knowledge of art
found the photos to be artistic.

Being a gay artist gave him an
added interest in the trial, Arroyo
said.

palace

By Tammy Poole
Staﬂ“ Writer

Pitt students and guests said
they had to see for themselves
how Frank Lloyd Wright’s
Fallingwater was actually built
on a waterfall.

The home was designed by
Wright in 1936 for Pittsburgh
department-store owner Edgar J.
Kaufmann and his family. In 1964
the home became open to the
public for tours. The Pitt Program
Council's travel committee
sponsored a tour of the home.

“It is just unbelievable,” said
sophomore Jacqui Kozza. “I had
seen pictures of the house, but
until you see it for yourself, it is
just incredible. You really have to
see it in order to appreciate it for
what it really is. I would really
like to live there."

The home is made of sandstone,
concrete, steel and plate glass.
Wright was an organic architect,
and his idea for designing the
home was to combine the housing
into nature. The home itself
balances on a boulder, which
also serves as a ﬁreplace for the
living room.

“I'd rather live in the main
quarters of the house because it
contains more space. Theother
saatear tH8'i’1<5u"‘§e"‘seE'hfed"lt9’<o
contrived and compacted. I really
liked the architecture, but I don’t
think that I would want to live
there," said senior Heather
Neisworth.

Wright designed all furniture in
the home except the dining—room
chairs and the standing chairs.
The dining-room chairs were
purchased by Kaufmann’s wife
in Italy and are from 300 to 350
years old. A desk chair in one of
the guest bedrooms was also
purchased by Kaufmann’s wife.
That chair stands at a value of
$300,000, which is more than the
price of the home. The price of
the home was $155,000.

Sophomore Jennifer Ernst said
she liked the house almost
enough to want to buy it.

“I thought the house was really
neat. I especially liked the
swimming pool that it had. I want
to buy that house. There has to

~ be a reasonable price that I can

buy it. I really liked it,” said Ernst.
Neisworth’s mother, Betty

Neisworth, said the furniture in

the home was very interesting.

“I really enjoyed looking at the
chairs and the pictures. I came
because I had to see for myself
what everyone else was talking
about. There weren't any real
surprises, though,” said Betty.

The home is located halfway
between Mill Run and Ohiopyle.
Tours run from April through
mid-November every day except
Monday. From mid-November
through March they run on the
weekends.

Pitt cornerback focuses on life after football

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Many children grow up with dreams of
playing college football, of scoring the
game-winning touchdown or making the
game—saving tackle on national television.
Not Marcus Washington. Even though he
has lived that dream for the last ﬁve years
as a defensive back for the Panthers,
Washington is still looking for his childhood
dream to come true.

“I want to be a United States senator.
New York, Washington, anywhere '— it

doesn’t. matter,’ said Washington.

But that’s only after he's made his millions
asa Wall Street tycoon.

As high or unrealistic as those goals may
sound, slowly they are becoming possible.
Washington received a bachelor’s degree
in ﬁnance last August, and this semester
began working on his master’s in business
administration.

“It’s always been a childhood plan of

Growing up near the hallowed grounds
of the Orange Bowl in Miami, Fla., Scott
Kaplan used to dream of one day kicking
winning ﬁeld goals for his favorite teams,
the Miami Dolphins and the Miami
Hurricanes.

This Saturday, Kaplan has an opportunity
to show the home team a few things he
can do, as it seems Miami was not too
interested in him coming out of high
school. ~

Kaplan grew up in Coral Springs, Fla., a
suburb of Miami. “I grew up in the shadows
of the Orange Bowl, and naturally I had
visions of one day kicking there,” Kaplan
said. He probably never imagined it would
be for the University of Pittsburgh, though.

“When I was in high school [Coral

Springs H.S.], Miami had a couple of good’

~13. kickers, and they really were not interested

in me,” said Kaplan.
Come to think of it, Miami probably will
not need to recruit another kicker in the

mine, to get my MBA, then go to New York
to work on the New York Stock Exchange
for five or six years and then be a U.S.
senator,” said Washington.

Washington is the only Panther to already
hold a degree, and in an age when the
mettle of college athletes is constantly
tested, he is a refreshing change from the
stories of those who couldn’t take the
pressure of academics and athletics.

“Yes, it's rare. Most people use the extra
year to give themselves more room to do
other things. Only 19 percent of college
kids graduate in foifr years,” said
Washington. “But I came here for a reason",
I didn't come here to mess around.”

“Marcus has done a very good job
learning how to balance [football and
educationl," said Pitt Coach Paul Hackett,

,who has expounded" an “academics ﬁrst"

attitude since he was hired last December.
“That’s what success is all about. T here’s
a direct correlation between the two. Your
future is based on what happens off the

field.”

Washington began his Pitt career in
1986, seeing action in only one game. In
1987 the Mobile, Ala., native was redshirted
after suffering an injury in the second
game of the year.

As a redshirt sophomore in 1988
Washington played in four games on
defense and in all 11 games on special
teams, registering 12 tackles.

Last year Washington appeared in only
six games at the beginning of the season,

and only in passing situations at that.

This season, Washington has played in
all eight games,'«starting-six, and is sixth on
the team with 32 tackles. '

A “Marcus has done an excellent job this
year. He had his best game last week [ﬁve
solo tackles, one forced fumble]. He's
getting better every week,” said Hackett.

This week Washington figures to see a
lot of action against the University of
Miami and its heralded passing offense.

“We’ll play a lot of man-to—man coverage

against Miami. I like that,” said Washington.
“You can get right up in [the defender’sl
face; that’s my type of game. You can play
more aggressively.”

Despite the ‘Canes much-publicized
passing, Washington is more concerned
about its rushing game.

“Their passing game doesn’t impress
me,” said Washington. “Their wide
receiverslroutes are not that disciplined.
[In man—to-man] you can tell right away if
it’s a run or apass. If they come off the line ,
and block, then it’s a run, and you go to
attack the run." .

Playing football and keeping up with
schoolwork takes a lot of dedication, and
the fact that he is even playing against
Miami is, in itself, evidence of his dedication
to both. He didn't have to come back for
another season, but he wanted to.

’ “There were still some things that I
wanted to accomplish,” said Washington.

’ “I finished my degree in August, so I went

to [fall] camp and decided to play.”

Miami battle cry: Beware the run

It’s Miami and Pittsburgh this weekend, and I for
one, am worried. Harken back to a year ago, as Pitt
welcomed the Hurricanes into» Pitt Stadium.
Remember the talk of the explosive nature of the
Miami offense, led by budding star quarterback
Craig Erickson. Think about the “experts” saying
that it could be a high-scoring affair. Remember
how boring the actual game was, as both teams
seemed to forget the high-ﬂying

he does not hesitate to use three or four wideouts.

But don't expect offensive fireworks on Saturday,
I say, after carefully outlining the dangerous abilities
of the Miami offense. Nope, like last year’s contest,
Miami will take its complex passing game and
utilize it as a decoy. It will emphasize the running
game, ably manned by Stephen McGuire and
Leonard Conley. Why? Simply because that’s what
will win this game. Pitt’s pass

exploits of years past in a 24-3
Miami win, which featured
running.

Now, think about this year’s

defense has been improving and
should be able to contain (not
shut down) the ‘Canes aerial
' assault, while the run defense

game. At his weekly press
conference, Pitt Coach Paul Hackett made good
use of the word “speed,” saying that Miami had it
“everywhere —- on both sides of the ball.” Coming
from the coach of a team that was victimized by “the
Rocket” last week, it seems that Hackett should be
concerned. “I thought we were playing the best
team in the country last week,” said Hackett, “but
after opening the ﬁlm can of Miami, they may be
better.”

Most of the concern in the Pitt camp centers on
Miami’s bevy of talented receivers, which includes
Wesley Carroll, ranked 13th in the nation in receiving
yards per game. Hackett called Carroll “one of the

has been porous and inconsistent.
When the Panther secondary handles the big job of
defending the pass, it won’t be able to provide
much run support, which is bad news.

Notice also Miami’s tendency to score big against
bad teams and keep it close against teams which
defend the pass well, like Brigham Young University
and Notre Dame, and even Pitt last year. The huge
task which faces Pitt on defense is made more
difﬁcult when Miami can run the ball.

In that respect these two teams are similar. Both
coaches agreed that they have common styles.
Both use many different pass formations, and both
need a successful running game to win. Right now,

next couple of years, as longtime
incumbent Carlos Huerta still has what
seems like another decade on his
scholarship.

At any rate, Kaplan weighed scholarship
offers to various schools. “Penn State
showed a lot of interest for a while, but
when Pitt entered the picture, [PSU] backed
off. I was also interested in Syracuse, but
I_ really liked Pitt,” he added.

Kaplan began his collegiate career in
fine fashion, replacing then-starter Jeff
Van Horne after the second game of the
season. The 6-foot-1, 180-pound redshirt
sophomore went on to lead Pitt in scoring
for the 1988 season, with 53 points.

Going into‘last season, he considered
himself a cinch for the starting spot. “Last
year, I got beat out. For whatever reason,
being it that I wasn't in shape or that Ed
Frazier had a great year, I came back with
a strong desire this year,” he continued.
“The media seemed to make a big deal out

Pin‘ defenders not bowled over by Midm

By Ryan Buncher

With 3,497 total yards and 35.9
points per game, the University
of Miami offense has been running
up big numbers on every
opponent this year. Several
Panther defenders remain divided
on whether the Hurricanes will
provide the toughest offensive
challenge this season.

“Miami’s receivers don’t run
disciplined routes,” Pitt senior
cornerback Marcus Washington
said. “They don't run as
disciplined routes as Louisville.
That’s what made Louisville so
good. [But] Miami is excellent in

Shop ing

the speed department”

Washington went on to say,
“Their passing game is not very
impressive. It’s their backfield
that is impressive."

Running backs Stephen
McGuire (484 rushing yards and
nine touchdowns) and Leonard
Conley (366 yards and four TDs)
have added balance to the
Hurricane attack this year.

Combined with receivers
Wesley Carroll (39 receptions,
three touchdowns), Lamar
Thomas (28 catches, four TDs)
and Randall Hill (26 catches, one
TD), the Hurricanes have gotten
off to a 5-2 record and a Top—10
ranking.

Senior free safety Doug Hetzler
seemed to have a different point
of view than Washington. “They
are great athletes, and they make
the catches,” Hetzler said. “I’d
hate to see what they would do
if they ran disciplined routes."

“It will be a little different [from
the teams we’ve faced this yearl,”
said senior inside linebacker
Prentiss Wright “It will give our
[defensive backs] more of a
chance to show what they can
do.”

He also spoke of the
importance of pressuring Miami
quarterback Craig Erickson (147
completions in 252 attempts for
2,145 yards, 13 touchdowns).

“Erickson has been erratic,
having a great game one week,
then an average one the next,”
said Pitt head coach Paul Hackett,
“but he has thrown only five
interceptions.”

Despite the fact that Notre
Dame has scored 76 points against
the Panthers in the last two years,
Wright feels that the ’Canes have
the better offense.

“McGuire is a hell of a running
back; he and Conley are good.
[And] Erickson is a hell of a
quarterback. That’s the difference;
they have so many weapons.
Against Notre Dame the other
guys did OK, but Rocket [Raghib
Ismail]  Rocket hurt us.”

When asked the same question,
Washington simply answered,
“Notre Dame has the better
offense.”

“It's hard to compare,” Hetzler
said when asked if Miami has the
best offense Pitt will face this
season. “The teams we've played
run such different offenses, like
Oklahoma runs the option, and
they had a lot of success against
us. I really can't say.”

“[Miarni] has been successful
against everyone they've played
this year," said Hetzler. “Their
quarterback averages something
like 320 yards a game, so
obviously they haven’t been
stopped yet."

Crew team rows away with six medals over weekend

By John Labriola
suqr writer

The University of Pittsburgh crew team
rowed away with six medals this past
weekend at the fourth annual Jack
Speakmon Memorial Regatta in Columbus,
Ohio. 1

The Panthers earned three gold medals
and three bronze.

Two of the Panthers’ six medals were
captured during the men's open-4s, in
which Pitt took both first and third places,
with Carnegie Mellon placing second.

According to Pitt Coach Joel Kehm, this
event was dominated by Pittsburgh-based
teams. ‘

Rowing in the gold-medal heavyweight
boat for Pitt were, (from stroke): Todd

Ridenour, John Evers, Matt Prechtel, Pete
Alpern and coxswain Leanna Hopkins.

In the bronze-medal heavyweight boat
for Pitt were, (from stroke): Pete Otterbein,
Paul Herron, Nate Kehm, Matt Eriksen and
coxswain Annie Schleicher.

The Panthers earned two more bronze
medals in both the lightweight women’s-
4s and the women’s open-4s.

Rowing in the open women’s open—4s
were, (from stroke): Nancy Jordon, Gina
Carnillo, Lori Shofran, Trish Cloonan and
coxswain Leslie Burchett.

Rowing in the women’s lightweight boat
were (from stroke): Julie Norris, Ann Marie
Dipaolo, Debbie Yorinks, Amy Meier and
coxswain Buffie Halcom.

Pitt’s novice women’s boat, in its first
appearance in competition, earned a gold.

According to Kehm, the novice women

' dominated their race and finished 10

lengths (450 feet) ahead of their closest
competitors in the preliminaries and two
lengths (90 feet) in the ﬁnals.

Rowing in the novice women’s boat
were, (from stroke):Jeanette Kelper, Mariah
Creech, Missy Miller, Stacy Browning and
coxswain Ebony Lattimer.

The Panthers’ lightweight men's boat
took the gold for its race, as well as a
pewterbowl for winning the race. All
three gold medal crews received pewter
cups.

Pitt took the bowl from the Ohio State
crew team, which had won it for the last
three years. '

Before the race the Ohio State coxswain
decided to try to psych out the Panthers by

yelling at them.

According to Maria DePasquale, the
coxswain for the men's lightweight boat,
the Ohio State coxswain’s plan backfired,
and only added fuel to Pitt’s fire.

Ohio State was so confident that it
would win the bowl yet again this year
that it had already sent it out to have its
name engraved on it for this year.

Rowing in the Panthers’ lightweight
boat were, (from stroke): Bob Falk, Graham
Turnbull, Mike Kuchera, Mike O'Connor
and coxswain DePasquale.

Some other schools entered in the regatta
were Cleveland State University, Duquesne
University, Indiana University, Marietta
College, Mercyhurst University, the
University of Charleston (W.Va.) and the
University of Cincinnati.

Racquetball courts ape

By Chrissy Cullen
For Tbe Pitt News

Pitt has long been known for
its athletics — a school with a fine
reputation and a long list of
athletes reaching the professional
level in many sports. One may
assume that such a sports-oriented

’ school would have excellent, or

at least adequate, facilities around
campus.
But such is not the case if you

~ are into racquetball.

Usually, one enters a
racquetball court through a door,
closes it and starts playing. Here
at Pitt you will not have the

convenience of stepping. onto. 

the court through a door. In fact,

  you’d._,better not be  of
‘ ._ heights. '

O ' In order to get into the courts at
Trees. Hall, you must stand on a
small cement wall and reach out
for a ladder extended from the
court’s ceiling. Once you have
accomplished the task of Climbing
down the ladder, you are then
responsible for removing it from
the court. This is accomplished

by pulling on a rope attached to
the foot. Finally, the ladder
becomes parallel to the ceiling
and can then be secured by
wrapping it around a metal hook
in the corner.

Randy Patrinos, a Pitt student,
frequently plays racquetball at
Trees. Patrinos, who is “sensitive
to heights,” does not like climbing
down the ladder into the court.
He said, “I look straight ahead as
I climb down.” He is also
concerned about getting injured,
not being able to climb back up

the ladder and not being able to I
get down.

Bob Murphy, who also plays
racquetball at;Pitt, admitted, “I’ve
never,  anything like this,“

 to the setup of the courts. . »
He said that because of the ladder, .

“it is difficult to get out of the
courts, especially after a hard
game. You are in a pit. The
courts are not used enough
because the ladder is ridiculous
to some. There should be nothing
obstructing the court.”

He said sometimes the ball hits
the hook’ in the corner. He also

’-saw problems with the _lighting.

“Other courts I have played on,”

have been completely white.
There is not enough light from the
few that they turn on,” he said.

Frank Pepe, who plays
racquetball with Murphy, said,
“The light creates shadows on the
walls.”

The court walls are cinder blocks
covered by paint. “They are not as
predictable as in other courts,”
said Pepe. He also said the courts
need something to keep the air
moving, like fans.

Marilyn Ross, co-director of Pitt’s
intramural recreational program,
said the reason that the courts are
in their present condition is a lack

" of funds. courts were put in
at the time of Trees Hall's
construction. Pitt ran out of

money while building the courts. A

“Pitt was never able to ﬁnish
the courts the way they planned,”
said Ross. A room was dug out
behind the courts so that doors
could be built to provide easy
access. But Pitt ran out of money
before installing the doors. Then
someone came up with the ladder
idea. 0

About the subject of inadequate
lighting, Ross said, “The lighting
is not quite what it should be.”

Most racquetball courts use
ﬂuorescent lighting. The courts
at Trees, however, use mercury-

-vapor lights. During the energy
crisis of the mid-
eliminated every other light bulb
in order to conserve energy.
These bulbs have not yet been
replaced. “All I can do is keep
asking for better lighting, but I
don’t think they will ever replace
or repair it,” said Ross.

Several proposals have been F

made by Ross and other
concerned members of the faculty
to improve the conditions of the
courts. When asked about any
future plans of improvement, Ross
said, “I don’t know about it at this
point. It all depends on the state
of the economy and the
availability of funds.”

summer because [Pitt] Stadium
was under construction with the
new turf. So in that respect, I'm
not worried. Actually, I’d never
played on AstroTurf until I came
up north,” he commented.

Then again, with the climate
down in Florida, there isn’t any
reason to have anything but
natural grass. Not to mention that
the grounds at the infamous
Orange Bowl are about as well-
manicured as fields get.

As for this season, Kaplan
remains upbeat despite the
Panthers’ disappointing record.
“As with anything, there are going
to be highs and lows. There are a
lot of positive things the team

will get from this year.”

He added, “As for highlights,
the 46-yarder I hit against
Oklahoma was one.”

The other highlight of the
season for Kaplan took place last
Saturday against Notre Dame,
when he caught a pass from
holder Doug Hetzler for the
Panthers’ two-point conversion.
That put Pitt within striking
distance of the Irish. Panther head
coach Paul Hackett quipped at
the weekly press conference
yesterday, “This week Scott is
going to practice with the
receivers and [Pitt’s receiver coach
Skip] Peete.”

Although Kaplan has no desire
to go out and take on the Miami
defensive backs, he certainly
wouldn’t mind drilling a few extra-
points and field goals over their
heads.

He also wouldn’t mind being
able to return to Miami at
Christmastime with the bragging
rights. “I’m good friends with one
of their starting linebackers, Mike
Barrow. He was able to give me
grief after last year’s game. I want
a role reversal this year,” Kaplan
said.

Another one of Kaplan’s regrets
is that he hasn’t been able to
enjoy all the games this year.
“When you play the big games,
you don’t get the opportunity to
enjoy them for what they are. It is
too easy to get totally wrapped
up in the games,” he said. “College
football is such a great sport; I
wish I could enjoy the games
during them. But I kick well
when I'm submerged in the
game."

This weekend, Kaplan hopes _ .

to steer the Hurricanes in the
losing direction. And get the
Panthers out of the storm front.

Run

Continued from page 7

’Without Curvin Richards, who

continues to be day—to-day, the
Pitt running game is a second-
rate UCLA. And UCLA is third-
rate.

In order to win Prentiss Wright
said that his team has to “stick to
its assignments and get a helmet
on [the runnerl.” The senior
linebacker is right, but that’s what
Pitt had to do against Oklahoma,

£00.

The point is that Pitt’s games
this year have been awfully
difficult to predict, and this game
should be no different.

For those who are expecting a
high-scoring affair, think again.
Both teams will have to pound it
out on the ground, so a healthy
Curvin Richards would boost the
offense signiﬁcantly.

Saunders for President. . .

With this year’s Student Government Board elections
next week, two very qualified candidates are seeking the
position of SGB president.

Brent Saunders, presidential candidate and current
Inter-Fraternity Council external vice president, holds
more SGB accountability as his primary goal for the next
year. He runs behind the slogan, “Representative of and
accountable to the student body.”

Current SGB member Michael Cohen also believes that
students should have more access to the SGB. If elected,
Cohen plans toextend his hours and keep himself open
to student concerns.

Both candidates feel that public safety is a primary issue
in this year’s campaign. They both plan to keep the South
Oakland shuttle operating, and they also want to work
with the councils of both North and South Oakland to
improve relations between the campus and the university.

Cohen wants to bring back self—defense classes for
students. He also plans to create a “stay-safe guide,”
which would give students information about certain help
centers, such as the rape and suicide hot lines.

One of the projects that Saunders plans to undertake as
president would be a crosswalk on Forbes Avenue
between Schenley Quad and Forbes.Quad to give students
an alternative to dodging cars and jaywalking.

Both Saunders and Cohen fully endorse the reinstitution
of the academic affairs committee. This group would
watch over teacher evaluations and give students the
chance to see the quality of professors who are available
for certain classes.

Saunders, however, has definite plans to keep the SGB
accountable to the students on this campus. He plans to
install a bulletin board beside the Towers, which would

hold daily accounts of what each SGB member did during
office hours. Saunders also has definite plans to keep
student-interest groups involved in the decision-making
process of the SGB. He plans to retain the Representative
Student Council but also plans to create a liaison group to
meet with both the RSC and the SGB to make sure student

groups are considered in SGB decisions. This would be

an efficient way to keep the SGB from abusing its power.

Students should keep in mind that both candidates are
highly qualified for this job, and either one would make
a good president. However, because of the accountability
factor and the checks he plans to impose on the SGB, we
endorse Brent Saunders for Student Government Board

President.

 

Sacrificial practices were good

Oh no, must be the season of the
Wtcb!
—Donovan

I’m just waiting, waiting for the

» deluge of “Geraldo” specials and

news reports concerning an
increase in “ritualistic animal
murders and satanic grafﬁti" now
that Halloween is here. In years

past the American audience has

had to endure the media’s latest
darling: satanic and occult crimes.

Crimes? Pull up yer chair, pardner.

The main problem taxing the

police departments (and media
wing-wangs like Geraldo Rivera)

are the “supposed” sacriﬁces —
animals and people found in
darkened basements with

inverted pentagrarns and all the

props of the occult world. I say
“supposed” because these killings
are not as noble as sacriﬁce.

If one were to actually look
into what the history of sacriﬁce
is, one might actually understand

why some modern and older T

pagan religions use it as a theme.
Originally, pagan religions of the
Celts and Druids made sacrifices
in hopes that the crops would be
plentiful the next year. Their
sacriﬁces might have been of
people (who were quite honored
to give their life over to the greatest
of all good) or of animals which
were strongly tied to the pagans’
agriculturally centered lifestyle.
Since followers of these
religions tended to believe in

cyclic lives, in that they lived over
and over, they saw their own
death as a rite of passage like
birth and death. Simply, these
people never really died; they
just existed in another form.
Therefore, death wasn’t the end.

Now what of Satanism?

 

Jessica
Coville

Although the religion of Satan is
almost always linked with pagan
religions, it is not pagan. It is an
offshoot of Christianity, with its
main deity being the ultimate
fallen angel and embodiment of
evil, Lucifer/Satan. And if these
hysterical housewives were to
actually look at The Satam'cBz'ble
by Anton Levey to see what the
satanic View of sacrifice is they
might be surprised.

Satanists believe that actual
sacriﬁces of animals are ridiculous
because they feel that animals
aren’t worthy enough to be killed

for Satan anyway. As far as
sacrificing people, Satanists
believe that their enemies will

fall of their own volition. Don’t‘\

believe me? Think the devil’s
making me write this? Look at the
text of The Satanic Bible and see
for yourself.

And what of the Christian
religion itself? Do not its followers
revere a sacriﬁced man and even
wear his putreﬁed image around
their necks for all to witness how
he gave his life so that they may

go to heaven? 4

What about these murders and
the people who commit them? I
believe that these are some very
sad people who don’t understand
what the true nature of sacriﬁce
is. They are kids who watch
these television shows and think,
“This would be a great way to get
rid of some anxiety and create a
disturbance.” Basically, they

aren’t Satanists or pagans, they’re '> ‘

just some people with displaced
anger

So I leave you with this as
Samhain (Celtic festival of the
dead, otherwise known as
Halloween) approaches and pose
the Judeo—Christians a question
—— What makes your barbecued
chicken any more noble an act

than these misguided people and 1

their “sacrifices?”

jessica Coville is the assistant
managing editor for The Pitt
News.

Iraqi atrocities common for a war

The [Rob Lewis] article in the Oct. 25 issue of Tbe
Pitt News reﬂects an utter lack of thought. You '
ridicule the Faculty Council resolution on the basis
of a minor semantic point and then object to

individual positions within the
document by relying on a highly
selective memory.

Perhaps this war is “Saddam
Hussein’s doing,” but would

Saddam Hussein be doing it if his nation were not atrocities?The U.S. rnilitarywas involved in Vietnam,
so impoverished by the U.S. imperialist policies in "
the region? Hussein is not acting pre—emptively;

Letters

rather, he is responding to economic pressure
brought to bear on his region of the world by the

United States at the lowest prices in 15 years, ,.
effectively starving Iraq.

You continue by asking if the Faculty Council
includes Kuwait citizens in its resolution. You cite

an atrocity, implying that U.S.
presence in the region will
somehow prevent such incidents.
Has it ever occurred to you, Rob,
that having a war might escalate

too. Do you think American soldiers raped women
or murdered children? [...]
