Bill Clinton, seen here during a visit to Pittsburgh, is the President-elect of the United States,

By Jim Lakely

Managing Editor

Twelve years of Republican
control of the White House
has ended.

Democratic Arkansas
Governor Bill Clinton defeated
Republican George Bush and
independent Ross Perot for the
office of president of the
United States. ‘

Sweeping the electoral
votes of the northeastern
states, including/Pennsylvania,
and carrying most of the
South, it was clear early last
evening that the Clinton/Gore
steamroller was not to be
stopped.

CBS News declared Clinton
the winner at 10:49 p.'m., with
Ohio’s votes giving him the

nod.

Clinton collected 363 elec-
toral votes to Bush’s 118 at
press time. Perot recieved no
electoral votes. V

The popular vote was much
closer than the wide electoral
gap. Clinton garnered over 35
million, or 43 percent of the
vote. Bush earned almost 32
million, 39 percent of the vote.
Perot earned the largest per-
centage of votes for an inde-
pendent candidate since Teddy
Roosevelt in 1912, with 15 mil-
lion, 18 percent.

Returns from Soldiers and
Sailors, the polling place of
local Districts 7 and 8, were
consistent with the national
results. Clinton received 790
votes to Bush’s 256. Perot fol-
lowed closely behind with 197

votes.

Last night, the night before Student Government
Board elections, Jacob Brody and Christopher
Skutches met in the Kurtzman Room for a debate.

Questions were asked by a group of panelists
from the Black Action Society, Resident Student
Association, Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Alliance,
Campus Women’s Organization and The Pitt News.
Then, the audience and current board President
Gil Golden had the opportunity to question the
two candidates.

In opening statements, Skutches said that during
his sophomore year when he was on the
Allocations Committee, he got a feel for the needs
of the students. “I’m taking that information still
and using it in all my decision—rnaking,” Skutches
said.

“I have worked for you and I’ve done that since

Clinton addressed his sup-
porters with his acceptance
speech in Little Rock, Ark., at
12:30 a.m., expressing his
thanks for support and his
vision of the future.

“This is a victory for the
people who feel left out and
left behind,” Clinton said. “You
can trust us to wake up every
day remembering the people
we saw on the bus trip, the
people we saw at the town
the people we
touched at the rallies, the peo-
ple who had given up hope.
All of them together are saying
‘We want our future back,’ and
I intend to help give it to

Halloween

weekend

Byjohn Temple
Staff Writer

Halloween was a vio-
lent, gun—ﬁlled day on the
Pitt campus.

One shooting, a rob-
bery of students by men
carrying a gun and anoth-
er report of a student
being threatened by a
group who said they had
a gun occurred last
Saturday, according to
campus police.

Assistant Director of
Public Safety Gary Moses
said that the campus
police are involved in sit-
uations with guns more
and more frequently.

“If you listen to the city
police radio you hear
reports involving guns all
the time,” Moses said.
“But it only gets into the
media when someone
gets hit.”

A man was shot twice
in the chest after an argu-
ment with a group of
men on the corner of
Oakland Avenue and
Fifth Avenue at 3:20 p.m.
Saturday. The suspect ﬂed
the scene and campus,
and city police searched
the area unsuccessfully.

The victim was taken to
the hospital where he is
in stable condition,
according to Moses, who
said the city police have a
suspect. None of the men
involved are affiliated
with Pitt.

In another case, police
arrested three men, one
carrying a shotgun, for
the robbery of two Pitt

students and another per-_

son at _12:48 a.m.
Saturday.
While robbing the

group of victims in front
of Primanti Brothers
Restaurant, the men said
that they had a gun but
did not show it. Campus
and city police searched
the area and confronted
three men who fit‘ the

suspects’ descriptions on '

Fifth Avenue. Finding a
shotgun on one suspect,
police arrested the group.

On the same morning‘
at 1:50 a.m., another male 
—. student reported that he ‘ ;_
. was approached‘ by an ‘J
A ‘ LS,-.i”g'roup"."of acquaintances’
"‘ ' who threatened. him,- say'-}”‘
ing that they had a gun". _

The suspects‘, who are
not affiliated with Pitt, did
not show a weapon.

Directors of Public
Safety William Brennan
said that guns are becom-
ing a problem every-
where in Pittsburgh.

Republicans resigned

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Eyes glued to the TV monitor, as if unable to believe what they
were seeing, several College Republicans watched as the color
blue, representing Clinton-won states, slowly filled up the video
map of the United States.

A “I’m scared, I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m afraid all college stu-
dents won’t get jobs in three years,” College Republican member
Kevin Docherty said at the somber Bush/Quayle party in the
Westin William Penn Hotel last night.

Even though it was clear Bill Clinton was to become the next
president, all was not lost for the Republicans.

“In four years, [lack] Kemp will fix everything,” Docherty said
while pointing at his jacket lapel with the words Jack Kemp ‘96
crudely written in black marker.

SGB candidate Tom Grassia lamented the fall of the Republican
reign as the band played John Phillip Sousa’s “Fanfare.”

Local Democrats elated

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

Hundreds of excited supporters erupted into mayhem at
a Democratic victory party last night when CNN announced

that Bill Clinton will be the new president of the United.

States.

Nearly every inch of space in a gala banquet room at the
Sheraton Hotel in Station Square was filled with screaming sup-
porters waving Clinton signs, popping champagne bottles and
even crying. _ .

Moments before Clinton won the presidency, the frenzied
crowd chanted “five more,” referring to the five electoral votes
Clinton needed to clinch the presidency.

Pitt’s University Democrats was also present at the party. At
the announcement of Clinton’s victory, the entire UD executive
board embraced.

The murder rate for
Allegheny County» has risen sig-
niﬁcantly, especially in the city
of Pittsburgh, according to The
Greensburg Tribune-Review.
There have been 69 homicides
in the county so far this year
compared to the 1991 total of
65.

“With the economy being so
poor, people are out of work,

and you’re naturally going to

Brennan said. “We’ve actually

Shawn McClearn said.

Arthur DeCourseg, field
director for Clinton in Western
Pennsylvania Said, “I just feel
like this is the greatest night
of my life.”

At one point ‘during the
night, a champagne bottle
unexpectedly exploded into
DeCourseg’s face as he deliv-
ered election results atop a
stage draped with red, white
and blueballoons.

"This was the last Bush tac-
tic, it was his last fizz,” said
Tony Boule, a volunteer for
the Clinton Campaign and a
student at Pitt’S Graduate
School of Public and
Education Affairs.

Boule said the campaign
united Democratic officials
from all areas of the country
into a family.

“It seemed"like everyone
became friends. This is some-
thing hard to do when you

‘have people. from diverse

backgrounds,” he said.

“It’S an excitifgg: day to be a
Democrat in l2fénnsylvania,”
Flaherty said. “I’ve supported

him Since New Hampshire,

and I neverhad any doubts
about him.”

country that we love everything that it was
meant to be,” he said. “I still believe in a
place called hope,” metaphorically referring
to his birthplace of Hope, Ark.

At his concession speech in Houston,
amidst cheers of “Thank you George,” Bush
wished Clinton well in the White House and
promised to assure the smooth transition of
power of the Executive Branch saying that
“America must always come first.”

“The people have spoken  we respect

the majesty of the democratic system,” Bush ‘

said. “We must stand behind our new presi-
dent. I remain convinced we are a rising
nation in a difficult period.”

Bush urged the young people of America
to get involved in the politic process. “It
needs drive, initiative and conviction,” he
said.

Bush also credited Clinton for running a
strong campaign.

Members of Pitt’s University Democrats
rallied at Sheraton Station Square, cheering
Clinton’s victory.

“It’s a great day to be a Democrat and an
American,” Shawn McClearn, president of
UD said. ’

“This feeling was indescribable for
words,” Hayes Davis, secretary of UD said.

Many of Pitt’s College Republicans rallied
at the 17 ﬂoor of the Westin William Penn
and expressed their disappointment with
Bush’s defeat.

“America will realize that electing Clinton
is a mistake,” CR Kevin Docherty said. “I’m
scared. I’m scared. I’m scared. I’m afraid all
college students won’t get jobs in the next
three years,” he said, adding that he is hope-
ful Jack Kemp will run for president in 1996.

“I’m a Christian. I’ve gotta have faith,” he
said.

address the problems of gay and

Brody said that the first ‘step
would be to sit down with
BiGALA and talk about the
problems on campus and then
to research and understand. He
added that there needs to be an
increase in education for all stu-
dents.

Skutches said that he could
call up the schools that Fantin
said had successful programs
like Rutgers, University of
Massachusetts and Ohio State,
and get their plans and imple-

ment them here at Pitt.

Executive assistant of BAS
Keith Davis asked what SGB will
do for African-American stu-
dents.

Brody talked about the need
for a multicultural diversity cen-
ter on the corner of Forbes
Avenue and Bouquet Street. He
said that it all comes down to
the education curriculum chang-
ing with society to be more cul-
turally aware. V ‘

Skutches said that part of the
$17 million from Governor
Casey with Project Jump Start
could be used for a multicultural
center.

The Wizard of Bill

A sweeping tornado has hit the govemor’s mansion
in Arkansas. The occupants inside the air born man-
sion ﬂoat around for hours wondering where they will
land. Finally, the mansion falls into a strange and mys-
tical land, not painted yellow like the book says, but
white. A large obelisk for whom the city is named,
stands representing the Good Fairies who resided
here. The governor’s mansion has changed colors and
appears white —— just like the rest of the city. The
occupant of the mansion appears, “I don’t think were
in Arkansas anymore,” she says to Toto.

The residents of OZ —— a city consisting both of the *

imaginary and the real — emerge and rejoice. The
mansion, it seems, has fallen on the Wicked Witch of
the East and killed her. On Nov. 4, a song rings
through the city — “Ding dong the George is dead, the
Wicked George  “ All that is left for Dorothy to do
now before she can tap those ruby-red slippers togeth-
er and go home is attack the Wicked Witch of the West
and hope that the witch’s pet monkeys don’t carry her
away before the hour glass runs out.

The wicked witch that Dorothy will have to attack is
the economy. Time and time again she has reminded
us that Chelsea and the other little munchkins
shouldn’t grow up as the first generation to do worse
than its parents. However, right now there is a huge
deficit, and Dorothy has to face up to the fact that
since OZ is not in the yellow, but in the red, some
generation will have to do worse for subsequent
munchkins to do better.

Right now, her plan is inadequate. She knows it, the
Economic Wizard knows it and the rest of the citizens
know it. Unfortunately, this would prove to be politi-
cally unpopular, and The Lollipop Twins (Congress
and the.Senate) and Dorothy would feel the wrath. To
ultimately defeat the Wicked Witch, it would be neces-
sary. V _ ‘

But not all things in OZ are that grim, and Dorothy
has some good proposals to fight those ﬂying mon-
keys. For one thing, educational performance should

‘rise. Dorothy’s plan, although expensive, is a good
one and entitles the Scarecrow to a higher education.
Secondly, the Tin Man will no longer have to worry
about his heart and inadequate health care. And third-
ly, the Lion will be provided with adequate training
and will be able to compete with rival nations.

Well Dorothy, there are a lot more monkeys you
have to attack before that hour glass runs out. And,
fortunately, we don’t have to remind you not to inhale
those poppies along Pennsylvania Avenue. But we will
tell you that you and The Good Witch (Gore) have at
least four years to go before you can tap those ruby-
red slippers together and say, “There’s no place like
home, there’s no place like home  “

Welcome to Canada's Twilight Zone

1996 — The presidential. elec-
tion is well under way, and after
a year of hard campaigning, the
candidates are running neck-in-
neck. As the results from the
polls come in, states all around
the country line up behind their
candidates. Soon the number of
electoral college votes are,virtu-
ally even with only one state
remaining to report its results.
Finally, after a tense and bitter
campaign, British Columbia casts
the deciding vote on the
Republican side giving them
enough electoral votes to claim
victory —— in the Twilight Zone.

Sound like a bad script for a
science fiction story? It’s closer to
reality than you think. Last
Tuesday, six Canadian provinces
and one territory voted to reject
new constitutional reforms
aimed at acknowledging Que-
bec's distinct culture.

Some in Quebec voted ‘No.’
They felt the reforms didn’t go
far enough, while many citizens
in the west, such as British
Columbia, voted ‘No’ because
they felt the reforms went too
far. The vote dealt a serious
blow to attempts to keep Canada
uniﬁed; it has brought the possi-
ble independence of Quebec
one step closer. But how would
this affect Canada and its rela-
tionship with the United States?

Quebec plays a key role in
Canada as an economic and
political balance between
Ontario and the other provinces.
Economically, Quebec has sup-
ported redistribution of public
money toward the poorer
provinces. These special grants
allow these provinces to pay for
public services without having to
endure large tax burdens.

Were Quebec to secede from

F Canada, the poorer provinces

would lose inﬂuence and risk
becoming economically isolated
from the rest of the country.
Some, such as Nova Scotia’s
Premier John Buchanan, have
even hinted at the possibility of
joining the United States in order
to solvethis problem.

the

Politically, Quebec acts as a
balance between Ontario and
the western provinces by siding
with Ontario on issues such as
representation; and siding with
the western provinces on issues
such as government centraliza-
tion. Without Quebec, the deli-
cate balance could be irreparably
damaged. The rich western
provinces would have little eco-
nomic incentive to stay within
the Canadian federation and
could decide to go it alone. '

Alternatively, rumors have
popped up in the media that
some western provinces may

Mike
Brittingham

even wish to join the United
States should Quebec secede.

Of course this is a worst case
scenario. The fracturing Canada
is far from certain. Recent polls
have indicated that outright inde-
pendence is looking less attrac-
tive to the citizens of Quebec.
Many other Canadians would be
just as happy to get rid of
Quebec and go about their lives.
Even if Quebec secedes and the
rest of Canada breaks up and
attempts to join the United
States, the barriers to acquiring
statehood are enonnous.

What is important here is not
likelihood of British
Columbia becoming the 51st
state but the fact that Canada
risks becoming the latest victim
of a global trend toward political
disintegration. This trend threat-
ens to become the theme of the
1990s as the list of victims grows.
The Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia have already suc-
cumbed to economic hardship,
ethnic hatred and petty national-
ism. Attempts to halt this disinte-
gration have had little success.

While Canada will probably
not break into a civil war over
ethnic differences between
Quebec and the rest of the coun-

, try, the symptoms are still there.

As people go around with a
“my—culture-is—the-best” attitude,
the nation’s economy suffers.
This, as well as shortsightedness
and people’s own single—minded,
economic selfishness, have con-
spired to sabotage efforts at pre-

serving unity. Nationalistic fever

has overcome economic reason,
and the victims are the everyday
citizens of the nations in turmoil.

What must be remembered is
that the United States is not

immuneto petty nationalism. In a - .

time when racism is on the rise
and a weak economy has
become the battle cry of people
around the nation, people are
clamoring for the government to
give them more and more, while
it can only give less and less. But
the problems of others are of lit-
tle concern to us, and shortsight-
edness and quick-fixes have
become the rule of the day.

If this continues, we risk losing
the unity that has made this
nation strong, and we may end
up sharing a room with Canada,
the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia
in the world’s hospital ward for
chronically-ill nations.

With the national election safe-
ly behind us, it is now time to
stand up, look beyond our petty
troubles and see the big picture.
The world is no longer made up
of isolated regions scattered over
the face of the earth. The nations
of the world have become
dependent upon each other, and
we cannot afford to withdraw
within our borders or within our-
selves.

Canada should serve as a’

glaring example of what must
not be allowed to happen to the
United States. "In a land that
prides itself on being the ‘Great

Melting Pot,’ we must not allow 1

cultural diﬂerences to shatter our
economic prosperity. Now is the
time for us to look toward the

future and rebuild not just our .

country but our unity.
Otherwise we may one day find
ourselves living in a nightmare,
unable to wake ourselves from
-— the Twilight Zone.

 

 

  Soccer sets team reco

ByBrian Gallagher

To the victors go the records —
one big record
. 'Ihe.Cinderella story known as
the 1992 Pitt soccer team complet-
ed its regular season in record-set-
 fashion last night, upending
inner-city rival Robert Morris, 2-0,

_ at Pitt, Stadium.

With the win, the team's 12th of
the season, the underrated 1992

‘ * Panthers enter the school’s record

books with the most wins ever by
a Pitt soccer team —- breaking the
.mark of 11 wins set by the 1985
squad. ‘

Pitt ended the season with a
sterling 12-4-1 record. Robert
Morris drops to 11-7-2 overall.

Skill and hard work were evi-

- dent on both oﬂfense and defense

for Pitt Tuesday night. Eric Duffy
and Ted Noethling paced the

Panthers’ attack with a pair of ﬁrst-

period goals. Adam Spitzer and
the stingy Pitt “D” suffocated the
Colonials’ offense for the team’s
10th shutout of the year.
According to Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher, the record of his

’ winningest team ever speaks for

itself — this is his best Pitt team
ever.

“Overall, yes it is [my best
team],” Luxbacher said. “The first
few years that I was here, we had
some good teams, too. But I think,
overall, our talent is better.

“We have the right blend of skill
 plus some good, hard players,”

he said

5 Skill and hard work personiﬁed
Pitt’s play against the Colonials,
particularly in a sloppy but pro-

‘ ductive ﬁrst half.

The Panthers’ first goal came
just two minutes into the game,
when midﬁelder Duffy recovered

a loose ball and fired past Robert

Morris goalie Doug Petras for a 1-0
‘advantage.

Eric Engman_fI‘he Pitt» News

Eric Prex has been a key contributer to Pitt soccer's team-record 12 victories.

Pitt is the kiss of death and the for-
mula for a road loss.

“We made two or three key
mistakes, and they scored two
goals on those mistakes,”
Kowalski said. “Against a team like
[Pitt], you make a few mistakes,
you’re going to lose 2-0.”

Pitt’s second goal was a score to
remember -— a 2(}yard hooking
laser by Noethling that mesmer-
ized goaltender Petras.

After taking a pass from defend-
er Bob Dyer and dribbling along
the left sideline with the ball,
Noethling looked to cross the ball

Prices hurt Penguin attendance

First, the three-time National League
East Champion the Pittsburgh Pirates and
its fans were criticized for the lack of '
attendance. Now that baseball is over,
those critical fan blasters can shift their
focus to the Penguins in their asinine
efforts to put the fans down.

To date so far, the Pens have sold out
three of six home dates. As a result, peo-
ple are saying two things: that either the

would like you to believe. After all, aren’t
Pittsburgh fans the disloyal following who
couldn’t draw two million for the Pirates?
Once more, this is a stupid response to
the attendance problem. The Pirates drew
in the top five in the majors if you look at
the ratio of the population of Allegheny
County to the total attendance.
Pittsburgh’s population is on the decline,
so why should it be expected that more
people would be able to show up at

sively in ‘92, his recent olfensive
surge (he scored two goals against
Syracuse) couldn’t have come at a
better time; Pitt travels to Storrs,
Connecticut this weekend for the
Big East Conference soccer cham-
pionship.

“I just want to get back on
track,” Noethling said. “'I’m not
looked upon to score that many
goals this year. But I’rn glad I’m
starting to put them in anyway.

“This [weekend] is a great
chance for us. We can prove our-
selves to virtually everyone.”

The second, half of the RMC-Pitt
game saw the Panthers dominate
defensively.

When called upon, Spitzer came
up big again and again to squelch
Colonials’ attacking trio of Ernesto
Pitt, Chris Hultquist and Marco
Patitucci. His shutout win tied the
school record for most shutouts in
a season (10) —~ set by current Pitt
assistant coach David Torrence in
1985.

For sophomore defender Dyer,
the win against the Northeast
Conference champion Colonials
was not the best effort of the tour-
ney-bound Panthers, but it was
more than sufficient in stompinga
tough Pennsylvania rival.

“It was sort of a tough game to
play right before the tournament,”
Dyer said. “It was kind of tough to
get up for.”

“We didn’t play as well as we
could  but we played well
enough to win.”

Looking ahead to this week-
end’s run for the league title,
Luxbacher expects the best of the
best from the Panthers’ first oppo-
nent “Seton Hall is
rolling now,” Luxbacher said.
“They beat Georgetown, 3-0, and
Syracuse, 6-0.

‘‘I think we match up well with
them. They have more talent
probably, but that doesn’t mean
we can’t win.”

Volleyball spikes WVU

By Chris Weber
Staff Writer

Maybe they couldn’t wait
to get home to catch the
election results.

In an efficient, if unspec-
tacular display, the Pitt
Panther volleyball team
quickly got the job done and
disposed of West Virginia
University 15-7, 15-4, 15-13
in a non—conference match
last night at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

Despite their solid busi-
ness-like play, the Panthers
appeared uninspired in the
victory.

“I think we looked a little
disinterested and sort of lost
our focus,” Pitt assistant
coach Cindy Braziel said,
referring to a loss of the
intensity the team had
shown in wins against Big

East rivals Seton Hall and
UConn last weekend. “We
looked very relaxed
tonight.” .4  ,

Though uninspired, the
Panthers were rarely threat-
ened by the Mountaineers as
they dominated both sides
of the net from the opening
point.

The Panthers jumped out
quickly in the match, receiv-
ing solid play from junior
outside hitter Ann Marie
Lucanie and first-year play-
ers Sara Mitchell and Sarah
Mikla.

After consecutive cross-
court kills by Lucanie and
Mitchell, the Panthers seized

"control of the first game, 11-

4. Pitt further increased its
advantage to 13-4 on a hard
spike by Mikla before West
Virginia began to mount a

comeback. The Mountaineers fought back
to within six points at 13-7 on successive
blocks and a service ace, but Pitt
slammed the doors on the West Virginia
run and took the first game, 15-7.

“I was very pleased with our effort,”
Braziel said. “We did the basics real well,
and that worked for us tonight.”

In game two, Pitt picked up where it
left off, jumping out to leads of 3-0 and
8-5, respectively. After a timeout, the
Panthers proceeded to bury the
Mountaineers. Lucanie and Co. capital-
ized on numerous West Virginia errors
and ran off seven unanswered points to
take the game, 15-4.

The Panthers received good efforts on

defense from Mitchell and first-year
defensive specialist Laura Horvath, as
well as offensive production from sopho-
more middle hitter Melanie Gustafson.
The Panthers were able to do whatever
they wanted on offense and kept the
Mountaineer defense off balance with a
variety of shots in the second game.

“We are getting exceptional efforts from
a lot of people,” head coach Sue
Woodstra said regarding the Panthers’
diversified attack. “Am [Lucanie] has had

a lot of pressure on her with teams key-

ing on her on defense, but our younger
players are getting more and more com-

fortable, and that makes it tougher for *

teams to play against us.”

It was not much of a stretch for the Pitt volleyball team to knock off WVU last night.

Continued from page 8
refreshments and any mer-
chandise you might buy, the
cost of attending a game
could total almost $100.

Last year with the cheaper
tickets, the Penguins sold
out 32 of the 40 home dates.
Now I may not be a rocket
scientist, but I don’t think
that you need to be one to
figure out that it’s no coinci-
dence that the attendance
has dropped as a result of
the price increases.

Another reason that I think
the Penguins fans’ atten-
dance has dropped is a ‘
result of the Pirates’ success.
With people going to the

National League
Championship games, it is
that much less money people
have to go see the Pens. I
mean, maybe you haven’t
heard, but the economy isn’t
good these days.

So take my observations as
you wish, but to Penguin
fans that might be reading
this, I ask, how many games
have you or will you attend
this year? If it’s one to five, I
consider you average like
myself. If it’s more than five,
consider yourself lucky
because I sure wish that I
had your money.

up.

“We tend to play like our
competition,” Braziel said
concerning the Panthers’
deficit in game three. “We
played at their level and fell
behind. Fortunately, our ath-

leticism picked up the
pace.”

The Panthers tied the
game at 7-7 on a hard smash
by Lucanie. West Virginia
continued to hang tough,
blocking well to regain the
lead 12-9. The Panthers,
however, then proceeded to
gain control and overpower
the Mountaineers, as good
blocking by Lucanie
and excellent play by first-

 
 
  

year middle hitter Alyssia
Yanik sealed the final game,
15-13.

The win improved the
Panthers’ record to 13-10
overall, while dropping the
Mountaineers mark to 12-12.

Pitt will conclude its Big
East slate this Saturday at
