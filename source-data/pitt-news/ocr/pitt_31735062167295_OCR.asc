GOV. RAYMOND SHAFER

   

Governor
Advocates
Co—operat1on

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

A state—related university is a
concrete example of how a gov-
ernment can supplement. while
not actually control. what the
people themselves do. State-re-
latedness involves a cooperation
of public and private interests.

This concept of a state—related
institution was presented by Gov-
ernor Raymond Shafer of Penn-
sylvania. Governor Shafer spoke
at the University Commencement
Wednesday morning at the S_vria
Mosque.

Pennsylvania is involved in a
unique partnership with the Uni-
versity. according to Shafer. He
called this “an exciting develop-
ment for the concept of state gov-
ernment." Shafer stressed that
this new concept involves the
state enhancing what the people
themselves do.

Wood Cites Developments
In Urban Renewal Problems

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

Dr. Robert Wood. Undersecre-
tary of the Department of Urban
a n d H ou sin g Development
iHUDi. began his speech detail-
ing the plans and programs of his
department with a political jest.
"I was very happy to accept the
invitation tonight.“ he said. in
fact. ever since the President‘s
announcement. almost any mem-
ber of the Administration will be
happy to accept almost any invi-
tation."

From then on. however. no
mention of politics was made.
This nation was “Johnny—come—
lately" in facing its urban prob-
lems. he said. but he admitted
that definite progress is being
made. Within the last 28 months.
programs initiated on a voluntary
basis by the Federal Housing and
Home Finance Agency have been
written into law.

Also. he pointed out. the sums
provided by the government have
been multiplied twenty—fold.
Other contributions have been
made by the Bankers‘ Associa-
tion. the Ford Foundation and
other agencies. Despite a “late
start." said Dr. Wood. “the re-
building of American cities is the
number one item on the agenda
of the L'rban Affairs Committee."

He presented four experiments
recently started in the US. The first
is termed “open option." Under
this program, 35 communites are
expected to band together to cre-
ate metropolitan complexes of
four people each. The second idea
is that one of the "model cities"
program. In this setup, commun-
ities are encouraged to partici-
pate as a unit in all activities.
This type of "togetherness" is
being tested in 75 cities, includ-
ing Pittsburgh. Wood proposed
that this “would create a new
partnership between city hall and
the neighborhood.”

The third system he named is
designed to encourage areas

, ...



which have already begun the
program of "planning and acting
together." "Metropolitan area de-
velopment grants" are awarded to
these more advanced a r ea s. A
fourth idea of HUD is to assign
“890 regionally-—based federal
representatives to aid and over-
see the programs."

Wood emphasized an appeal to
universities. "We h a ve m ade
progress in obtaining legislation
and funds." be said. "the remain-
in- elements we need are know-
how and manpower." Only the
universities can fulfill "the need
for quality control." Wood stress-
ed the necessity for "changes in
priorities. to take a chair from.
say biology and put it in the Ur-
ban Affairs Department iUS).“

A graduate student in UA at-
tending the lecture agreed with
Wood, adding that “only one
chair in each class in UA is fi-

Shafer stated his purpose in
speaking as “making sure the
University climbs in quality.” He
hopes it will become a “great
center of learning in the world.”

Quoting Jose Oretga. a Span-
ish philosopher. Shafer called life
"a series of collisions with the
future." He stressed the impor-
tance of hope in the future of
University graduates.

Approximately 3.500 graduate.

degrees were awarded. Dr. Wes-
ley W. Posvar conferred five hon-
orary degrees.

University Graduates
Voice Parting Opinions

by DAVID TIERNAN

As the smiling students, parents and friends filed from the
Syria Mosque. many cordialities were extended. The big day

had come: Graduation.

A few of the graduates were asked what they felt should
be changed to improve the overall quality of the University.

Of the more than 50 randomly selected graduates, all but

two felt that the language re-
quirement and the distribution of
studies program should be
changed.

George Gray, who was captain
of the University's College Bowl
team and an honor graduate in
history, said, “There should be a
/rim-w:-_/«zi'n' policy concerning
distribution of studies and the
language requirement. If students
want to graduate with honors,
then they would have to take hon-
ors courses. If they just want to
graduate, they should take only
the courses they need to ‘do so.
The degree the students receive
would indicate the type and va-
riety of courses that they took.”
George is entering Michigan in
the fall to pursue his Masters De-
gree.

Mike Brourman. another mem-
ber of the College Bowl team and
an ex—reporter for the Pitt News,
noted that the University had
gone downhill in many respects
since he entered four years ago.
Brourman felt the language
courses should be graded on a
pass-fail system. He also indi-
cated that the out-of—state enroll-
ment should be raised to 25 per
cent. as it was when he was a
freshman.

A number of girls were ques-
tioned. but the usual response was
“I‘m just glad it's over." or “I'm
glad it didn‘t rain.“ One coed.
however. rapped the social life at
the University. She felt that too
much importance was placed on
sororities and fraternities in the
first two years of school. She said

   

 

CHANCELLOR Posvar addresses
graduating seniors for the last
time.

that the people to whom the
Greek system appeals during the
first two years are usually the
ones that find other interests as
juniors and seniors. and the fra-
ternities and sororities suffer
from the lack of concern of the
older members. “Every fraterni-
ty party I ever attended was the
same." the blonde stated. She
asked that her name not be used
due to her plans to attend grad-
uate school at the University next
year.

Al Rocchini, who had been stu-
dent commander of the ROTC at
the University, noted that gradua-
tion should be at the end of April.
Looking back over his four years
at,the University, Al said, “Once
I moved on campus, I found that
everything w a s different.” Al,
who is going to Medical School
at the University next year, said
that he was well pleased with

Tiny Tim Is For Real! First Album
Reveals Versatility And Honesty

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

Listen to him sing “Tip—Toe
Thru' the Tulips" and “Livin' in
the Sunlight" and _vou begin to
wonder. but hear him croon “This
Is All I Ask" and _vou know he's
for real. In Tiny Tim‘s first al-
bum. “God Bless Tiny Tim." the
audience comes ear to voice with
with a true talent of our «genera-
tion. singing songs of an Amer-
ica long gone. Mixing a falsetto
soprano with a vibrating tenor.
Tiny Tim. child man of the
groaners and crooners. somehow
makes it all happen.

The first cut of the album is
Tiny singing an introduction to
the album a cappella. "Welcome
to My Dream" is Tiny‘s way of
baring his voice at the outset.
preparing you for what will un-
fold in the remainder of the al-
bum. You hear this vibrating.
happy voice who has finally
made it as a singer. extending his
greetings to you. the listener. And
then he starts.

First it's “Tip-Toe Thru' the
Tulips.“ While the voice smells
of put-on. the orchestration does
not. and the ear. once doubting.
begins to believe._ Tiny has an en-
tire orchestra behind him. and the
mounting crescendo of the vio-
lins. coupled with Tim’s ukelele.
is a true goove to hear.

He then turns to a duet with
himself two cuts later in “On the
Old Front Porch.” The use of the
steel guitar is perfect for this
song that makes one think of
Pabst and “the good ol’ days.” He
turns also to Irving Berlin ahd
George M. Cohan for his next
two songs, and then switches to
some psychedelia with the mys-
tical “Strawberry Tea," again
with flawless orchestration. The
use of the harpsichord. echo
chamber, and Tiny's tenor and
soprano voices creates a mysti-
cal, illusionary song of now.

But the first side is simpl_v a
warm-up for the second one.
Here. Tim sings a few straight
ones that brought a lump to this
reviewers throat.

"Daddy Daddy. What Is Heav-

en Like?" is a song about a young
boy asking his grieving father
what heaven is all about. because
he wants to go there to see his
mother. Corny‘? Yes. it is. but

Tim's child-like voice is so shak-
ing. so innocent and so question-
ing. that the corniness is trans-
cended b_v the dramatic impact
and tenderness of the situation.
As the father in this song. Tim
unveils a voice that is a cross be-
tween Bing Crosby. Rudy Val-
lee. and Elvis Presley. As strange
an amalgam as this is. it works
for the song. and the listener.

There is not too much one can
say about the last song. It will
stop you. set you up. and put you
pown; for Tiny Tim sings “This
Is All I Ask” as it has never been
sung by anyone. Maybe it's the
truth in his voice. and maybe it's
the sincerity. but this song is the
classic of the album. and I do not
think it can be matched by any
singer around today. With the or-
chestra and Tiny working in per-
fect unison, this song is a tender.
moving ballad of love. that means
as much now, as when it was
written in another generation.

Put these songs in with the sa-
tirical "I Got You B,abe" and the
wildly joyous “Ever Since You
Told Me That You Love Me tlim
a Nut 1'' and you have a gathering
of music that will leave you sing-
ing the songs long after the stem
has been turned off.

Graduation

Graduation is time for happiness—a time that points to
a conquest of the educational challenge. But the feeling
of glee that accompanies graduation is unfortunately super-
ficial. Many of the graduates have serious complaints con-
cerning the University.

The class of 1968 has been subject to four years of
transition. During their freshman year. they entered the
University when it was under the leadership of the late Dr.
Edward Litchfield. The University had a truly cosmopoli-
tan atmosphere at that time.

However, crisis followed crisis and caused the once
private university to become state—related. This. to be sure.
changed the atmosphere on campus. All of a sudden. the
student body lost some of its diversity and more and more
students became complacent. The parking problem became
more acute because of the new influx of commuting stu-
dents.

The new graduates, moreover. witnessed and experi-
enced the leadership of three Chancellors. the late Dr. Stan-
ton Crawford, Dr. David Kurtzman. and Chancellor Wesley
Posvar.

Many of the graduating seniors might say that “they”
came. they saw and they conquered the challenge of the uni-
versity. But not really, for the same student problems that
existed four years ago remain unresolved today. When
some of the graduates became involved in student activ-
ities, they probably were quite optimistic about the resolu-
tion of student problems. Today, they probably feel that
those same problems will be debated vigorously. but that
they will never be resolved.

The graduates interviewed Wednesday by The Pitt News
believed that the University was in need of academic as
well as cosmopolitan change. One girl maintained that too
much importance was placed on the Greek system. Of the
50 persons that we interviewed, “all but two felt” there
was need for change at the University.

-We must wonder if the students who graduated Wed-
nesday will be proud to have attended the University‘? Will
these students be more than happy to submit financial as-
sistance to the University as alumni? We certainly can’t
pose as clairvoiants, but if the Alumni contribution totals
are any indication of the future, we can predict that_only a
small percentage of the graduates will ever give money to
the University.

Over the years, the University has had a great deal of
trouble in raising sizeable amounts of Alumni funds. The
raison d’etre for this unfortunate circumstance. in our view.
is the complete lack of pride that is generated by the phle-
-matic, blase’, atmosphere at this institution. This is why the
graduating senior feels there is a great need for change.
And we hope to provide the catalyst for that vital change.

Ia-sep And Eggs

Part Of My Past Died Monday

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Grandpa died Monday.

It was raining then. but Tuesday it stopped
for awhile. The cars and buses were rolling.
The people in the street were scurrying. It was
chilly. but people wished for sun
for the weekend.

They daydreamed about either
that Saturday night date. or the
forthcoming wedding. or the pic-
nic. The weekend is a relief for
the hustling. bustling people.

But he was from the old coun-
try. He knew the old ways. He
had a strong face. and maintained
a conservative belligerence. He
came here when he was 17. He spoke with his
hands. and when he got mad. he swore in Italian
and English at the same time.

THIS YEAR, 1953. a new president will be chos-
en. The president will lead society for four years.
He will lead the people.

But he won't be one of them. He retired from so-
ciety many years ago. Now hes retired from life.
He was my past. and now it is gone.

They called him Gus. short for Augustine. He
used to tell of Giseuppe. when they were kids in
school.

“JA-SEP couldn‘t add one—and—one-are—two." he
said. “One day de tee—cher she wrote . . . como se
dice arithmatic . . . a row of numbers on the board.
She call Ja—sep. I tell im the answer. Then he goes
to de blackboard. Writes down the answer. Then
turns ‘round and says. ‘Isa right Gus?" . . . Mana-
jana-mana-christo! " Hes a stupid! ”

Within a few years. man will reach the moon.
All systems are go—-the Apollo. the Gemini. It’s
progress.

But he won't see it. As a boy. I remember how
he would blowup and yell “Keepastilll" at me and
my brother. if we fidgeted or made noise. Yet he

LIES

 

When a guest came to his house. he would ask
him or her if he wanted something to eat. “Would
you like some sardines.“ he‘d ask. “.\'o . . .well how
about some eggs?" Then he‘d bring out this plastic
mold. which looked like sunny-side up eggs. He‘d
put it on a plate. and shove it in front of the guest.
who always then burst into laughter. He did this
until one day someone accepted his offer of eggs.

THE VIETNAM WAR might end. The students
may stop rebelling. The unions may stop striking.
But news for him. no longer is important.
He looked like Boris Karloff.
was staunchly built. and had white hair for as long

as I can remember. He loved to talk. and prefered
somewone who would listen.

Grandpa was 75.

That's why he like my father. and my brother.
They would sit and listen to his tales and his com-
ments. They listened and they learned.

AT THE SUPPER table though. no one was per-
mitted to talk until one had eaten. I was eight years
old. then. when we ate at his house. I always seem-
ed to dip the ends of my long-sleeved cordoroy
shirt into my soup. That didn’t bother him. but my
slurping did. He needed only to glare from his
seat at the head of the table and I stopped. Many
of those meals went down hard.

There are many memories. he made sure of that.

But I knew death was inevitable. One remem-
bers an old person as a picture. He was a picture.
Then he wasn‘t. and that‘s when I prepared my-
self for last Monday.

Monday at about seven in the evening was his
last. He died on a hospital bed. 20 days after his
May day birthday.

HE DIED MUCH like the man he was.

Yet people were waiting at the airports to fly
to Hawaii and Los Angeles and New York. Friends
bid him goodbye. and then returned to their jobs
and worries.

But he paid no attention to them either. He too

the nation's intellectual life. of
drafting male graduate students
into the armed services is lucid
and persuasive. He is probably
right in saying that "no sensible
American would argue that col-
lege graduates be exempt from
military service": certainly few
people would urge that only col-
lege graduates be so exempted.

In his letter the Chancellor ad-
dressed himself to a specific
question —- for a specific purpose.
I should like to pursue the sub-
ject somewhat further and consi-
der not merely the drafting of
college graduates but the draft
itself. This is a matter that has
been. and continues to be. hotly
debated: but usually in relation
to the present disastrous and
wholly regrettable conflict in the
Far -East. The fundamental issue
is all too often evaded.

Readers of the‘Pitt News will
have noticed a full-page notice
placed by some faculty members
recently. opposing the war in Vi-
etnam as unjust and immoral and
stating support of any students
who resist the draft on this ac-
count. Like other members of the
faculty. I was invited to sign this
document: unlike 47 others. I de-
clined — not because I thought it
went too far, but because I con-
sidered that it did not go far
enough in the proper direction.

The answer I returned to the
invitation may be of interest:

I have not signed the en-
closed statement. not out of

negligence. but because I can-
not agree with its premises.

I consider Communist agres-
sion. in Vietnam as elsewhere.
unjust and immoral. I also
strongly take exception to the
current fashion of laying the
burden of the conflict at Amer-
ca’s door. as the statement does
by implication.

Furthermore. I Consider op-
position to the draft because of
the specific issue of Vietnam.
rather than on the grounds of
violation of the Constitutional
prohibition of involuntary’ ser-
vitude. to be short-sighted and
misguided in the extreme.

To make my position quite
clear: my objection is not to
the draft caused by a specific
conflict: what I oppose is the
draft itself. a monstrous denial
of the "inalienable“ right of a
young man to liberty and to his
own life. I deplore the tenden-
cy of the present Administra-
tion (and Administrations of
the recent past) to consider that
the lives of the citizens belong
to the State. which can dispose
of them at will and hence can
engage in ill-considered for-

Columbia Awaits Decision

by ALAN SMOLOVER

NEW YORK — The ticket I had
been handed in front of Hamilton
Hall read: “Admit one to: the
FREEZING OVER of HELL
Effects by the FOUR HORSE-
ME.\' DCLXVI ‘Harrowing—

J. Christ."

The special "effects" were in-
deed something to s e e. three
weeks later on the Columbia cam-
pus. "Clotted with gore" is a line
from Poe. but it vividl_v describes
six. blood—spattered flights of con-
crete stairs in Mathematics Hall.

The May 11 edition of The
New Republic asserts that “Po-
lice violence was unprovoked and
unlimited. A pregnant girl was
dragged by the hair down Avery's
steps. Professors were beaten
senseless. In Mathematics. the
students were dragged down six
flights of concrete steps. leaving
blood so thick the cops were slip-
ping in it. With the halls cleared.
plainclothesmen turned on thou-
sands of innocent bystanders on
the university lawn. Hundreds
were injured. A male student.
thrown to the ground had his eve
gouged by a plainclothesman.
Horsemen on Broadway rode into
terrified crowds. trampling spec-
tators. For two and a half hours.
faculty watching through the
windows. and wounded students
still unremoved from the build-
ings. witnessed the police des-
troying furniture. urinating on
rugs. dumping files on the floor.

“The reaction was swift and
"emphatic. By that Tuesday after-
noon, the SDS-called strike that
had won the majority. The fac-
ulty, outraged, moved to increase
its power. In direct confrontation
with university directives, the
Committee on Instruction of the
c o l l e g e unilaterally ordered

classes closed for the week. A
Joint Faculties Assembly (pro-
hibited b_v university regulations)
was established. and its executive
committee began issuing direc-
tives on all universit_v activity."

Just what is the current “uni-
versity activity” at Columbia‘?
Some faculty have cooperated
with the SDS Strike Steering
Committee in offering ad hoc
courses to the children of the rev-
olution — courses with names like
Liberated Calculus or Liberated
French. Such courses met in pub-
lic restaurants. museums. faculty
apartments. and wherever they
can on campus. Columbia at large
is on strike.

Writing in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette of Ma_y 27. columnist
Sydney J. Harris attributes the
campus revolution to administra-
tive failure: "Everybody close to
the academic scene could see it
coming — except college presi-
dents (like Gra_vson Kirkl. deans
(like David Truman and Henry
Coleman). heads of departments.
professors and (least of all) trus-
tees. The important people were
oblivious of this threatening rev-
olution. because important peo-
ple always believe what they
want to believe. until it is far too
late.

“Students were not getting ed-
ucated in any meaningful sense
of the word. The college in Amer-
ica has been a huge and expen-
sive custodial institution, devoted
to everything but the main pur-
pose of education — to develop an

intellectual appetite and to lead
the search for human values. And
these are what students are cry-
ing out for. in their wrong-head-
ed but right-hearted way," wrote
Harris.

I can attest to the right—heart-
edness of the majority of Colum-
bia protestors. Their choice of
tactics is still subject to discus-
sion. amidst a fog of half-truths
and unprofessionally opinionated
reporting. No one has yet proved
that President Kirk's files were
meticulously xeroxed for future
publication. for example. And the
police have yet to answer well-
documented charges of unwar-
ranted brutality.

Was anarchy the theme of the
rebellion‘? The answer is an em-
phatic "NO!" for the protestors
are not against all or any author-
ity. A great university is unfor-
tunately polarized and paralyzed
for the duration of its “restruc-
turing." But the administrative
authority brought to account has
proven itself to be ossified. shown
itself as a slum-lord. exploiter of
cheap labor. and racist by virtue
of its ostrich—like ignorance of the
Negro problem on its Morning-
side Heights campus. Grayson
Kirk's Columbia. in the words of
a VISTA poster. made itself a part
of the problem by not choosing to
be part of its solution.

It has been said in defense of
social revolution. that "One does
not make omelets without break-
ing eggs." A very rotten egg has
been broken at Columbia: we
await the omelet.

Richey,Holly,
Salter Meet
Best In’ East

By BILL NAAB

This weekend. coach Jim
Banner will send thinclads Jer-
ry Richey. Charlos Reisen.
Bryan Salter. Wayne Bodenhei-
mer.‘ and Roger Holly to the IC-
4A’s at Philadelphia. Despite the
excellent competition. Banner ex-
pects good performances from his
five entries.

Banner realizes that his boys
will be competing against the
best in the East. butindicated par-
ticular concern for two of the en-
tries_. Banner anticipates that Rut-
ger’s Elijah Miller. Last year’s
champion. will be a rugged rival
for Bryan Salter in both the high
jump and the triple jump. And
Banner also indicated that a
Georgetown speedster named
Stageburg can be expected to be a
tough match for Richey in the
three mile.

In addition. Banner comment-
ed that Carlos Reisen had a trem-
endous outdoor season and feels
that he’ll do his usual consistent
job in the 440 hurdles.

For Wayne Bodenheimer and
Roger Holly, the IC4A’s will be
final collegiate perfor-
mance.

“The javelin field is tough. but
if Wayner stays consistent. he
should be right in there.” said
Banner confidently.

Banner also remarked that he
ean always expect a fine effort
from Holly. who will be running
the 880. Both Bodenheimer and
Holly entered the Philadelphia
competition last year. but neith-
er placed.

Thd recent bad weather should
not have a negative effect on Ban-
ner’s five entries. However, Ban-

Number One Man

Nichols Achieves Personal Win

by MARTHA HARTLE

Last week at Hiram College, Bill Nichols took the courts
as a varsity netter for the last time. He won his match easily

7-5, 6-2.

Winning was nothing new to “Nick." He had been winning for
the netters for three years as Coach Ben Pope’s number one man. But
in the eyes of the coach and his teammates. Nichols had experienced

his finest hour not in victory. but
in a losing cause at Penn State
last Wednesday.

In that match at State. he had
a personal promist to keep. He
responded by playing what Pope
thought was “the best tennis he
had played all his life" in a
match with a nationally ranked
State senior named Mario Oban-
do.

Nichols ha d faced Obando
twice before. Both times Oban-
do had shut him out 6-0, 6-0. This
Vear, Nichols promised himself
he would break that inauspicious.
He did. He went out and won the
very first game of the match. It

:0 . took him 20 minutes to win it, but

he proved to himself that Oban-

: is do could be beaten.

Nichols didn't go on to win that
match: he didn't even win one
set from the Puerto Rican star.

. as Obando walked off with a 6-1.

 

6-1 victory. But‘ four games in
each set went to deuce. Each set
was a long drawn out battle as
the underdog Nichols. whom the‘
Penn State crowd adopted as its
favorite. , never gave up.

State coach. “Boy I wish I had
that kid."

Coach Pope ranked the Nich-
ols-Obando match as the out-
standing contest of the season.
“Thirty-five years ago a match
like that would have been in the
quarter-finals or semi-finals at
Forest Hills. That’s how well

those boys played.”
Nichols finished the season
with an 8-7 individual record.

His won-loss percentage was
more impressive last year. but
Coach Pope explains that his star
was an improved player this year
despite the slip in his record.

"Sure Bill had a better record
last year. but the schools we play
have gotten better material and
have gotten better material and
his opponents have been much
better than in the past. He‘s im-
proved over last year; it's his op-
ponents that are tougher."

His opponents had gotten bet-
ter. but Obando was still the best.
Bill Nichols met the challenge
with his best and came home with
a big win——a personal one.

ner remarked that he would have
desired a few more outdoor work-
outs during the past week or two.

“The boys are in good shape.
We’ve had some good workouts.
and we’ve been doing a lot of jog-
ging.” said Banner.

COACH JIM BANNER

However. Banner explained

that Philadelphia’s weather today
a n d tomorrow shouldn’t make
much of a difference.
“Thye have an all-weather, tar-
tan track,” said Banner.
Regardless of the track or the

weather. the tracksters will face
their stiffest competition this sea-
son. Banner knows that his boys
must give more than 100 per cent
to creep above the likes of the
best from Maryland and Vil1ano-
va. He thinks they will.

Panther Baseballers End Season
Without Bid To NCAA Tourney.

by JERRY GRUEBEL

For the Panther baseballers. the season officially ended seven
days after their last game. The doubleheader sweep over Penn State
became the mitters’ final games of the 1968 season after a week of

rainy weather caused the cancellation of g .

ram College. and Lafayette.

However. . the season actually
ended for the mitters before the
Penn State doubleheader. The
day before the baseball team ret
the Nittany Lions at *Forbes Field.
the bids to the NCAA baseball
tournament were given out. And
the baseball team. a pre-season
choice to receive a bid from the
East. was not selected.

Despite the failure of his team
to earn a bid. baseball coach Bob-
by Lewis did not express disap-
pointment.

“The records of the two teams

selected from the East were just
too good for us to be considered,”
explained Lewis. “The judges
just felt that nine losses were too
much, and they werelright. 

The two teams selected _in the
East were Temple. (22-4) and St.
Johns (20-5).

“Our 16-9 record just can't
compare to theirs." explained
Lewis. “Thye had Very strong
teams. The St. John’s pitching
staff had a combined ERA of 1.19
and they also scored a lot of
runs.”

Although Temple and St. Johns
clearly deserved the bids, Lewis
feels that his team could have had
equivalent records with a little
bit of luck.

“We lost about five games that
we should have never lost." ad-
mitted Lewis unhappily. “We
should have never lost to Grove
City or Kent State. or that dou-
bleheader to Ohio State."

The doubleheader against Ohio
State came at an inopportune
time for the mitters. who at the
time were in the midst of finals
week.

“They had everything on their
minds except baseball,” said
Lewis after losing both games,
7-1 and 5-0, “but it’s my fault. I
was responsible for scheduling
the games and the games should
have never been scheduled dur-
ing finals week.”

Lewis had no excuse for the
losses to Grove City and Kent
State either. Against Grove City.

RECRUITS

Football coach Dave Hart is
happily to announce the signing
of two additional high school re-
cruits. Joe Carroll (6-1. 205) and
Bill Donovan (6-3. 220).

Carroll. an All-State end from
Warren. Ohio. Donovan. a full-
back from Baldwin. has been se-
lected to the All-WPIAL anp Big
33 teams: honorable mention All-
State team: and MVP of his high
school team.

-In addition. Paul O'Gorek and
Kent Scott have been recruited

Dave Wel_ty pitched ten innings

of two-hit ball. but found him-
self dead-locked in a 3-3 tie un-
til Grove City eventually scored
in the 12th inning off reliever
Bill Tress.

“We dipn‘t support Welty."
moaned Lewis. “We hit poorly
and fielded poorly too."

The loss to Kent upset Lewis
more. In that game the Panther
baseballers lost 10-8 and commit-
ted four official errors in addition
to many other mental errors and
eight Kent State stolen bases, that
caused their downfall.

"We scored seven runs in one
inning and still lost." said Lewis.
“We just played very poorly that
game.

Neither Grove City nor Kent
State had particularly strong
teams. and the mitters felt the
same way as Lewis about losing
to them.

“We should have never lost to
said rightfielder Tom
Stickel. “We played sloppy and
we weren’t hitting then.”

Over the last seven games. the
Panther baseballers played closer
to the potential that they had.
And they won all seven games.
But the mitters played winning
baseball after it was too late. and
with the season now over. they
can only look ahead to next year
