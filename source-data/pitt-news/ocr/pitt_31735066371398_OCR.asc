Pitt blasted for    

‘South Africa ties

Treasurer
acknowledges
investments

By Ana Puga
The Pitt News

The Black Action Society and three
faculty members called on Friday for Pitt to
sell off its investments in companies that do
business in South Africa.

“The university has a moral and ethical
obligation to divest," BAS president Daryl
Davis said at a morning news conference
held in the black studies department offices.

The students and faculty members were
joined in the demand by Pittsburghers

‘ Against Apartheid and a representative of

the NAACP‘s Committee on African and
Foreign Affairs. The groups further
demanded that Pitt open its stock portfolio
to show what investments it has in firms that
operate in South Africa. citing the universi-
ty‘s state-related status.

Apartheid is South Africa‘s government
policy of legalized social. political and eco-
nomic discrimination against blacks and
“coloureds“ (people of mixed race).

“By law. [the South African government]

.g can destroy families, murder citizens, pro-

hibit group support. deny civil. social and
political rights." Jake Milliones. a Pitt pro-
fessor of psychiatry, said. Milliones is also a
member of Pittsburghers Against Apartheid
and the president of the Pittsburgh Board of
Education.

Semester at
Sea plans no

return trips

The S.S. Universe, Pitt’s Semester at Sea‘s
500-student “classroom" ocean liner proba-
bly made its last visit to South Africa last
month.

“For the time being. we do not plan to go
back to South Africa.“ Max Brandt, Semes-
ter at Sea‘s executive dean, said.

Brandt’s statement came as a response to a
protest Friday against the  Universe's
stop Feb. ll-I4 in South Africa. The protest
was announced by three Pitt professors, the
Black Action Society. the local group Pitts-
burghers Against Apartheid (PAA) and an
NAACP representative.

“Instead of recruiting opponents of apar-
theid, we created advocates, supporters and
South African propagandists." Barbara
Sizemore, PAA member and black studies
professor. said.

According to psychiatry professor Jake
Milliones. “The Semester at Sea (SAS) pro-
gram allowed the South African govern-
ment to use it to propagandize. SAS
students now believe that South Africa is a
pleasant and good place to live."

Sizemore cited a shipboard survey
reported last . uesday in the Pittsburgh
‘Post-Gazette showing that only 22 percent
of the students surveyed saw any black or
colored areas of South Africa. Ninety per-
cent said they would like to return to South
Africa, 4| percent for tourism, 40 percent for
educational reasons and 9 percent to live

Students start their own
. teacher evaluations today

The Student Government Board will

begin conducting its own teacher evaluation

i survey among students today. the first day of
fall registration.

Members of the SGB‘s Academic Affairs
Committee will have the survey forms avail-
able and, manpower permitting, will distrib-
ute them at the Registrar's Office and the
Towers Lobby.

The chairman of the Academic Affairs
Committee. Bill Davis. last month said that
there was no excuse for the administration‘s

 

ment because of the limited resources of
OET.

Davis had earlier denounced Benjamin‘s
contention, calling the argument of limited
resources “a bunch of bullshit.“

Davis also oversees the course review
book. He said that the current effort by stu-
dent government is intendedlto get vital
information on teachers and their courses.

The committee plans to distribute the sur-
veys for about two weeks and hopes to col-
lect the finished surveys by the end of the

applicants for the awards.

“Because of the economy," she
explained, “fewer students are able
to give up their summerjobs to study
abroad. That‘s the best reason I
have.

“Until the economy straightens
up, we’re going to have the awards
somewhat confined to those who

, can afford to take offfor the summer

and study abroad,” she said.

The graduate awards are espe-
cially competitive, with 20-30 appli-
cants for each award. Pitt fine arts
graduate student Lucy Embick said
scholarships for graduate study are
“vital.“ She said teaching assistant-
ships are available. There is only a
limited amount of funding for study
abroad, and the awards available are
not for the amount ofmoney offered
by the Nationality Rooms Program.

Embrick plans to do her disserta-
tion study on the Bauhaus school of
art and architecture that existed in
the Weimar Republic. She must visit
the archives and locations where this
architecture can be found. Because
the materials can only be found
abroad, she said she is “very grateful
for the opportunity to study them."

Bruhns said study abroad is often
an asset to a resume but added the
scholarship committees are inter-
ested in sponsoring students -who
have an idea of their goals.

“Its an investment in someone‘s
future," she explained.

Pitt junior Jim Mercolini said he
applied for the scholarship because
it will be a valuable experience.

“It's so hard to market a bache-
lor’s degree, and this [award] could
distinguish me from other competi-
tion in the field." Mercolini said he
put almost two months of work into
preparing for the scholarship, but he
got a lot of encouragement from
former winners who told him about
the application procedure and what
to expect when studying abroad.

“I‘d like to reciprocate," he said.

Pitt junior Nancy Fong, a busi-
nessand Chinese major, said the
award gives her the chance to pre-
pare for a career in business and
learn about her own culture.

Fong said she would like to do the

-same for other students some day

and sponsor study abroad scholar-
ships. “Some people dream about it
but never do it," she said.

The original endowment for the
scholarship ran out, according to
Fong, but Edna Tsui donated $1,000
of her own money to keep the schol-
arship going and to send a student to
Taiwan this year.

Bruhns said she is not certain yet
how many scholarships will be avail-
able next year; the endowed scholar-
ships are offered every year.

Breaking The
 Grip

President Reagan’s nominee for attorney general, Edwin
Meese, III, may be investigated bythe Justice Department and
the present attorney general. The department met in an uncom-
mori meeting on Saturday to discuss Meese‘s questionable
financial dealings.

According to the Ethicspin Government Act, the Justice
Department is committed to investigate any high—ranking
administration member if it receives information linking that
person to a violation of criminal law. If Attorney General
William French Smith hopes to secure the integrity of his,
office, he must investigate Meese.

The investigation would, at best, vindicate the president‘s

I closest adviser. At worst, such an inquiry would confirm the

allegations that Meese has provided government jobs to his
friends and creditors and avoided telling the whole truth about '
loans made to him and his wife. '

Reagan has continually voiced unwavering supportifor

Meese and refused to consider withdrawing his nomination.

Reagan believes that despite all of the bad publicity Meese has
received, he himself still has enough power in the Senate to get
Meese conﬁrmed. '

Word of a Justice Department investigation has already

- shaken some of Reagan's grip on the Senate. Reagan seems to .
be sending a message to his supporters that it doesn't matter
whether Meese acted improperly or not. If the president wants

Meese, the president will get Meese. V _
The investigation may force the Republican-controlled
Senate to act on Meese‘s confirmation, not so much along

. party lines but out of concern for the Justice Department and

the good of the people. Which, after all, is what they are
supposed to be doing.

The inquiry currently being carried out by the Senate J iidi-
ciary Committee has raised more than enough questionable
actions by Meese to warrant the investigation. Last week, he
admitted that he forgot about a Sl5,000, interest-free loan
made to his wife by Edwin Thomas, his White House deputy.
Thomas is the fifth’ person who has loaned Meese money and
subsequently received a Federal position. ‘ =

This action comes dangerously close to being considered an
act of bribery. The Ethics in Government Act states that it is
unacceptable for Federal employees to accept gifts from their
underlings. '- i

If Meese has acted illegally or improperly, the people must
know, and the Justice Department should finally settle the
case. If Meese has not done anything wrong, he shouldn’t fear
an investigation by the group of which he will be in charge
should he be confirmed.‘ ‘

Letters To The Editor

Calling
for a

change

Dear Diary:

As I read the election results in
today's morning paper (Nov. 2,
I992), I flashed back on the
momentous day just like it in I984.
More and more editorials had
appeared in the ,newspapers about
television and radios insistence on
making the election results known
instantly — like after the first vote
was cast. The editorials argued that
this all but defeated the purpose of
general voting because predictions

chose the winner hours before the

polls closed. The general populace
had been less and less willing to go
the ballot boxes anyway because ofa
general feeling of laziness mixed
with impotence. And as I sat. as I sit
now — at my word processor mak-
ing myjournal entry —— I came upon
the idea for our present election
process.

Vote-By—Phone was such a revo-
lutionary idea that I was able to
copyright it, sell it to AT&T and
retire on the royalties. Used at first
in local elections as testing grounds.
then state elections and so on. Vote-
By-Phone was foolproof and user
friendly. Once I worked out the
voter fraud possibilities with voice
registration (a sort of vocal “finger-
printing“). we were on our way to
big bucks and genuine interest in
elections once again.

Since Americans already had a
well—established love affair with the
phone. it was no problem to get
them to vote. Dialing the 800
number assigned to the candidate of
your choice in the national elections
and the new regional toll—free
exchanges made it easy for any regis-
tered voter to “cast his ballot"at any
time of the day and from any phone.
Numbers were published in the pa-
pers and flashed across TV screens
all over the land.

This was the beginning of a new
era for political coverage by the
media. After AT&T lobbied heavily
for exclusive rights to election
results and Congress approved it.
the media, paid fees for the privilege
of releasing the results first after the
polls had closed. The TV people
didn't like it at first. Old Dan Rather
with a handset to his car was a pretty
static picture. But visual phones
made a lot of sense now and became
widely available.

Politics. too. became a whole new

‘ and less costly ballgame. Gone were

extensive personal appearances;

automatic dialing machines would
call a demographically compatible
group of citizens and blast speeches
and ads through the wires. Those
with visual phones were treated to
“personal" messages. often beauti-
fully_ photographed, from the
candidate. '

A Overall, it was a great success for
the United States and myself. I must
admit that every time I push those
little buttons on my Mickey Mouse
antique, patriotic sentiment wells up
in me and I want to play “Yankee
Doodle” to whoever answers the
line. And I just wonder why some-
body didn’t think of this earlier.

Pushers
of
plastic

is there no one out there in the

university community who is inter- -
- ested in a little intellectual volley? As

defined in “Webster's New Colle-
giate Dictionary," intellectual refers

'to someone engaged in rational

thought or speculation or study.

In writing previously. we asked
where the gumption of students was
by expressing a new idea or attempt
at a lifestyle unheard of in this rem-
nant of the “Me Generation."

Most students were called._in no
uncertain terms. “cocktail lounge
inhabitants“ and pushers of plastic.
Plastic. that awful idea that drove
Dustin Hoffman crazy in “The
Graduate.“ “Is there no more than
this?“ he asked.

The graduate is us; we are it!
Cocktail lounges. the atmosphere of
“Saturday Night Fever“ — the
thought is repulsive! But look
around you. Most will end up in this
degrading scene of exploitation and
waste. A waste of human cells in a
thought.

We all have more to give than
employed output. We havea legacy
or destiny to our children and oth-
ers. What .we do today will be
reflected tomorrow. To our soldiers
in Germany. there is a common say-
ing: “Live each day as if it is your
last, for one day. you're bound to be
right."

Who knows when that will be‘?
How many can say that ifthey were
to die right now. their lives truly
have meant something‘? And notjust
to relatives and friends. but to
others‘? "

So get off your duff; sure. get a

‘job. but there's more to life than a

job and a good party! Be responsi-
ble! If not, if you don’t care or ifyou

delude yourself into thinking you‘

are responsible, we guarantee that
we'll all end up on an ash heap! Let's
hope it's not too late to do some-
thing. to make a difference. Be
vigilant!

‘ Beyond moral
judgment ->

This letter is in regard to the edi-
torial in the March I4 issue of The
‘Pitt News entitled “Sexual Prefer-
ence and the Role of the Family.“

I I take issue with a point made by
K.A. Whittey —— what Whittey refers
to as the “core of the issue." The
author claims that the “real" prob-
lem in our society concerning homo-
sexuality is some mass decision
about whether this lifestyle is “nor-
mal" or “sick."

I strongly disagree. The issue is
whether “we" (who is that anyway’?
The good guys?) will allow homo-
sexuals to enjoy a peaceful "coexist-
ence. Whether I, or anyone else.
agree with their politics is irrelevant.

While Whittey treads carefully on
this strangely volatile issue. the
implication is that the majority of
the population must. somehow.

decide whether or not they are com-.‘&

fortable with the lifestyles ofa small.
certainly harmless minority. This
strikes me as ridiculous. The old
argument that homosexuals can
somehow he “created” and thus
should be feared has been disproven
countless times. (Cite work by Bell.
Weinbergiand Hammersmith. “Sex-
ual Preference." Indiana University
Press. l98l.) Why must we re-hash
old. irrelevant issues‘?

Spring brings welcomed end to Oakland blahs

In two days, the earth and the sun
will find themselves in an alignment
that eventually results in something

called spring. .

It has come not a moment too
soon.

Pittsburgh has been gray for too
long. There have beentoo many cold
mornings and‘ wet evenings, too
many of thosepatches of frozen
snow and soot that leave Oakland
looking likea neighborhood with
leprosy.

Oakland in middle February
through early March looks all too
much like a bad dream, shaded in
grays and filled with shifting images
of night. The voices of the newly
Americanized kids on Oakland
Avenue are muffled under scarfs and
second-winter coats. Their Big
Wheels are stored in apartment
basements, and silence pervades the
area.

The scrape of shovels rings in my
ears, and the look of the older people
of the neighborhood suggests that

~:_j
rd

getting out has long since become
more of an effort than a pleasure.
I could do well without ever hav-
ing cold wind blow down my neck
where the button fell off my winter
coat. Spring requires nothing more

  

than a jacket, and they all zip.’l’ve

‘never lost a zipper.

And would it not be nice to see a
flower that wasn‘t dependent upon
the water in a black bucket for its
survival‘? I could go for an acre or

two of the fragile yellow buds that
fight their way open on long April
afternoons.

I confess that unlike many winter I

enthusiasts, I have never developed
the only acceptable excuse for enjoy-

ing life between Octoberand March.
I don't and never expect to ski. I
would rather winter on the plains of
Kenya than strap myself into plastic

.boots and slide down hills.

_Besides, there are far too many
colors present in the average piece of
ski clothing for my taste.

I am convinced that snow has no
place on this earth outside the days
immediately preceeding and follow-
ing Christmas, and for that, we
could surely provide enough of the
artifical stuff to cover the holidays.

No longer do I want to have to
kick off soggy, snow-filled shoes. I
prefer instead to run in my stocking
feet and watch for bees in the grass.

I used to look forward to Little
League signups and the school pic-
nic at this time of the year. Now, I
would settle for enough ofthe sun to
justify cooking on the Hibachi and
forgetting to shut the windows.

Spring, come quickly and save my
spirit! Oakland has had its fill of
winter blahs.

O

Rape is one of those rare issues on
which there is no room for quib-
bling. Rape is a crime ofviolence. It
is a crime that drags man back to the
barbarism of his Neanderthal begin-
nings. It is anaction that no man can
understand to the same degree that
women do.

On a recent episode of the TV
show “Saint Elsewhere,“ a young
man of college age was discovered to
have testicular cancer. The outcome
was that one of his testicles had to be
removed.‘This was such an impor-
tant episode because it allowed men
a reliable comparison to the fear and
helplessness women must feel con-
cerning mastectomies. However,
there is no parallel for rape. Men
can't feel it the same way women
can. .

The purpose for my address. how-
ever, spawns from the specific and is
intended for the general. Two ofthe

six men accused of raping a woman
in New Bedford, Mass., were con-
victed Saturday and will be sen-

—tenced on Friday. Many of the

townspeople greeted the jury as it
came out of thecourt room. How-
ever, it was with curses and violence
that the jury was met.

The fact that two men had just
been proven to have raped a woman
while a crowed bar cheered them on
seems to have evaded these people.
Their concern seems to be that the
conviction will reflect poorly on
their ethnic community. What -is
even more repulsive is that the
twisted notion that rape victims wish
to be attacked still persists; indeed, it
was the defense of the‘ two men
standing trial. '

To what ethnic group they belong
is irrelevant. The details of the rape
are irrelevant; they only add to the

horror of the act and feed those ‘sick
individuals who derive some vicar-
ious thrill out of those things. What
is important is that in the great pas-
sage of time from the days of the
cavemen, society seems to have
made very little progress on this
issue.

Some archaic instinct to drag
their mates off by the hair still seems
to exist in these people, and our
society, rather than seeking to cor-
rect this, prefers to ignore it. We are
no better than the criminals we con-
vict if we do not seriously attempt to
change the attitude toward the acts
we have outlawed.

.Our pacificity has the effect of
condoning their actions. If judged
by the actions in New Bedford and
all across the country, we are
nothing more than well-dressed,
semi-literate baboons. A

‘Faculty more than babysitters

Many employees of the largest
job-provider in Pittsbujregh have
grown unhappy with their.wages,
working conditions and manage-
ment. Their employer has
denounced their claims and stifled
their attempts to gain strength by
unionization. It sounds like the oft-
repeated plot of a Studs Terkel
movie, but the scenario is real.

The employer is the University of

‘Pittsburgh. The employees are Pitt

faculty in the Provost's area (i.e.,
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
Schools of Engineering and Educa-
tion).

The administration at Pitt claims
that unionization is “not in the best
interest of the university or the
faculty," according to University
Counsel David Sullivan.

It is awfully considerate of the

‘university to decide what is in the

best interests of its employees, but it

is unjustified. The fact is, Pitt profes-i

sors punch a more demanding time
clock than an average college gradu-

ate but are compensated at an infe- p

rior rate.

According to the American Asso-
ciation of University , Professors,
full-time professors at Pitt, exclud-
ing those at the medical school, aver-
aged $3l,l00 last year‘. Faculty at
branch campuses made even less,
ranging from $23,800 at Johnstown
to Sl8,600 at Titusville.

Compare those» figures to the
salaries of Pittsburgh public school
instructors. The public school
teacher with a master's degree and
I0 years experience earns $30,830
under the Pittsburgh Federation of
Teachers contract.

The university professor, mean-
while, must possess a doctoral
degree, conduct original research
and publish books and professional
journal articles to establish tenure.

The United Faculty is justified in
its efforts to establish a faculty union
for the Provost's area. The facultyis

composed of hard workers who do a

i “ helluva lot more than a grade school

teacher second

graders.

who babysits

Winston woke up to an odd
noise outside his bedroom.
“Hey," Winston said, “What's
going on?" The noise stopped,’
and he leapt out of bed. He
opened the door to his apartment
and saw two men at the end of
the hallway. They looked at Win-

I ston and laughed.

“What's so funny?" he asked.

The men continued laughing,
and Winston slammedjthe door
furiously. He turned on the lights
and started a pot of tea. He
noticed the time on the clock
radio; it read four a.m. ‘

Who were these guys, and why
were they laughing at him at four
in the morning? Does everyone
have this problem?

Winston sipped his tea and
then shouted from his kitchen
table, “Who are you. guys; what
do you want?“ He waited for a
response, but there was none.
Then, there was a pounding on
his door.

The men kicked the door
down, and Winston madeihis
way to the fire escape. “Help!" he
screamed. People saw him from
their windows. How odd for a
man dressed in a robe and sneak-
ers to stand out on his fire escape
at 5:00-in the morning, the world
thought. The larger of the two
men flipped over the record.
“Hey," Winston said, “why’d you
do that.” The men laughed and
proceeded to steal Winston's
belongings: his Nike running
outfits, a college ring. a pair of
Christian Dior casual shoes, an

Cookies.

“Hey," he said, “what d’you
think you're doing?"

Both men, dressed in jeans,

otherand laughed.

Winston felt a chill go up his
spine. ‘‘I’m calling for help, see?
Help me! Help!" ’

“Why are you doing that?"the
smaller man inquired.

“Because you're _taking that
which belongs to‘me. Just look at
that bag that you're ﬁlling up.
This is not your apartment.
Those are not your shoes. That's
not your typewriter.”

“You are such a naive one,"
the smaller one chuckled, placing
a bag of grapefruit and oranges
into the sack.‘“Who is to stop
us?" .

“The police.”

“Where are they?"

“They're coming. All that

“Wise up, kid. Didn't you hear
the narrator just say the whole
neighborhood's go music blast-
ing? And, besides, the world
thinks you're kinda weird stand-
ing out on the fire escape in a

“Odd was the word."

“Odd, weird, what's the differ-
ence? Nobody's gonna help you, I
kid."

“The name's Winston."

“Hey, you mean you're not
Fred?" .

“No, I‘ve been Winston all my
life." ,

“Looks like I owe you an apol-

Fred a lesson. Is this Apt. 3M?"

Winston came in off the fire
escape. “Yes, but he lives in the
next building."

“Gee, l‘m awfully sorry for
bothering you like this, kid. We'll
just empty the sack_and be on our
way."

“You know, I always knew I
lived in a decent neighborhood,”
he told the smaller of the two
men. The larger one places a Bos-
ton Symphony Orchestra tape
into Winston's tape deck.

“Sure, kid. You can just think
of this as a dream. An American
dream. Kinda hasa nice ring to
it, huh?" said the smaller man.

“It sure does Boy, I guess you
guys lost a whole day's work for
ransacking my place instead of
Fred's. Boy oh boy, will Fred be
surprised.”

“Don't tell anybody about
this, kid. We'll have to hurt you.
It's bad for business, you__ know
"what I mean?“ '

“Is there anything, I mean any-
thing I can do to help?"

“Sure kid,“ says the larger
man, looking at the broken door
and his partner.

“What?”

. “If you hear any noise or anyb-
ody calling for help, just turn
over and go to sleep."

“Go to sleep?"

“That's what I said, kid."

“But..."Winston is struck on
the back of the head and left
unconscious. When he wakes up,
he finds himself in ajail cell with
the two men.

"Hey, kid! Wake up.”

“Don't bother me right now,"
Winston said, “I have an incredi-
ble headache."

The whole world laughs.

“Many students expressed resent-
ment toward faculty members for
‘making us feel guilty’ about having
a good time there,” wrote Barry
Paris, who is teaching journalism
and film history on the ship in the
article.

Semester at Sea chairman Keith
McDuffie said he was “shocked by
what the Post- Gazette reported as a
shallow, superficial reaction on the
part of the students.”

“If it is true that students just seek
a good time there, then we should
never go again," he said.

Brandt was aboard the S.S. Uni-
verse until it reached Capetown,
South Africa. He returned to Pitts-
burgh because of illness. He said
Sizemore’s statement was a “mis-
reading of the feeling of SAS
students." _

Brandt pointed out that only [36
of the 500 students responded to the
survey. He said he spoke to several
students who had visited Cross-
roads, one of the areas to which
blacks are confined under apartheid
laws.

“Students were moved by the hor-
rors of apartheid,“ he said. “SAS
visits China, Taiwan and Brazil to
see repression in all parts of the
world. It's not the same as reading
about it in a book."

_ “Most undergraduates had a diffi-
cult time understanding apartheid,“
Brandt said. “The faculty tried very

hard to educate the students about ~

apartheid."

“Did we fail to educate them?
Why did we fail?" McDuffie asked.
“When the ship returns, we will
investigate the whole thing."

After PAA protests in November,
l983, SAS had agreed to stop in
Maputo, Mozambique. SAS was
later informed that because of a
severe famine in that country, they
could not service the 700 passengers.

According to Brandt, the stop was
primarily for refueling and “to give
the students a chance to stretch their
legs." Capetown was the only port at
which no tours were prearranged,
Brandt said.

But Milliones contended, “My
frank opinion is that they planned to

stop in South Africa all along...l‘

. think there are a lot ofquestions that
need to be put on the table about this
kind of nonsense."

“Tyranny will not disappear with-
out action," Milliones said. “PAA
calls for a policyhof divestment and
sanctions against those who would
do business with South Africa
now!”

The administration responded
Friday afternoon by restating its
policy, followed since I978. of
investing in companies that do busi-
ness with South Africa as long as
they “adhere to the concepts con-
tained in the Sullivan principle."

The Sullivan principle. which
many universities use as a set of
guidelines for investment policy,
requires that American companies
operating in South Africa follow
fair employment practices, such as
non-segregation of the races. equal
pay for equal work and training pro-
grams for non-whites.

Joseph l)utton, Pitt‘s treasurer,
said the university does have some
investments in companies that do
business in South Africa. Out of
$|4() million that Pitt currently
invests in I00-l5() different firms. he
said about $l million is invested in

companies that do business in South
Africa. Dutton declined to name the
companies with links to that
country.

“The companies [that Pitt invests
in] do good work in South Africa.”
he said. “They are _striving for racial

equality."

The university will issue a report
next week about its holdings, l)ut-

"ton said.

"Black students at this school will
be proud of-the work we are doing.“
he said.

Davis said about 35 other univer-
sities have partially or fully divested
of their holdings with ties to South
Africa. ’

David Rosen. an administrator at
Harvard University, explained that
a policy of divestiture is generally
considered a stronger statement

- against apartheid than a policy of

simply followingthe Sullivan princi-
ple. Harvard will not invest in firms
that do a majority of their business
in South Africa, he said, but added
that “the university‘s position is
against divestiture.”

Barbara Sizemore, a member of
Pittsburghers Against Apartheid
and a black studies professor. called
the Sullivan principle a “cop-out.“
Because the Sullivan principle only
operates in the workplace. it is inef-
fective in combatting apartheid. she
said.

Help needed to “dig up”past

Volunteers are urgently wanted to take part in an archaeo-
logical dig of an Iron Age Hill Fort in Wales this summer.

The British archaeology summer seminars are sponsored by
the Association for Cultural Exchange of Cambridge, Eng-
land. The seminars and tour begin June25 and will end on July
21. The practical excavation begins after students have com-
pleted the seminars on July 3, and students are expected to
work on the dig six days a week. ,

Partial scholarships ranging between $ I O0 to $400 are availa-
ble for college seniors and will be awarded on the basis of need.
Application deadline is April 15 and students can obtain details
and applications by writing: The Association for Cultural
Exchange, Babraham, Cambridge CB2 4AT, England.

Guide helps future graduates

Graduates who are planning to attend graduate schools are
not only faced with the problem of finding the school but with‘
finding the right faculty. A new guide, however, might change
that. s ‘ B

One way to search for the ideal graduate faculty is to consult
the “Peterson’s Annual Guide to Graduate Study." The guide
lists many schools, academic programs and departments at
universities across the country.

The guide also lets graduate students know where to apply to
study under the accomplished specialists in all fields. Students
interested in writing, for example, might want to know Nobel
laureate writer Bashevis Singer is a member ofthe University of
Miami’s faculty, while biology majors might be interested to
know which DNA specialists work on the Harvard faculty.

The movie is “not always exactly
what you had in mind," he said.
“You have to be prepared for all
kinds of rude shocks if you get into
the Hollywood business.”

A series of sessions was held on
Saturday afternoon that was
devoted to what Gutkind called the
“moneymaking” aspect of writing.
Literary agent Barney Karpfinger
opened with a discussion of agents
and what they do. He said writers
often do not get their'fair share of
money from work they sell on their
own. An agent will negotiate fair
terms for contracts and also nego-
tiate clauses that writers know
nothing about.

Karpfinger added that the image
of agents as “parasites and money
grubbers" is, false and, “in the main,
agents are good guys.”

Freelance writer Geoffrey Nor-
man led the “Focus on Freelancing"
session. Norman is currently a con-
tributing editor at Esquire, where he
writes a column titled “The Environ-
ment." A very successful freelancer,
he emphasized freelancing as a busi-
ness. He said the writer must try to
sell his product as a businessman
does.

“Magazine editors are busy peo-
ple, but they also have needs....good
products and good articles,“ Nor-
man said.

He stressed that professionalism
is important when trying to sell arti-
cles.’He said writers should have
articles done on time and admitted
that tardiness is a problem prevalent
in freelancing. Writers should also
study the market, he said, making
sure their material is suited to the
audience. ‘

Although there are many writers
selling, there are also many buyers,
and writers shouldn't hesitate to
submit articles for publication, Nor-
man said. i

The Pitt isiews, Monday, March» 19, 1934,

Those who adapt will ﬁnd jobs in the ‘80s

3,‘ David McGraw
The Pitt News

The majority of Pitt's graduates in
law, medicine and business are man-
aging to find jobs after graduation,
contradicting reports that the pro-
fessional fields are glutted with grad-
uates unable to find employment.

The availability of jobs in these
professional careers is a more com-
plex matter than the supply and
demand statistics might indicate,
according to spokemen for Pitt's
professional schools.

The apparent glut of lawyers, doc-
tors and MBAs is forcing many
graduates to look towards different
types ofjobs within their fields and
to take employment in different
areas of the country. Pitt placement
staffers like Ellen Zonn, however,

~ say the jobs are there for graduates

aggressive enough to find them.
Although it may be more difficult
to get work as a lawyer today, Pitt’s
law school maintained a 94 percent
placement rate for I983 graduates
six monthsafter graduation. That is

about the same percentage as has
been achieved in the last five years,
according to Susan Fletcher, law
school director of placement. The
national average for the placement
of law school graduates is 87 per-
cent, and although this figure has
been declining in recent years,
Fletcher said it has been a gradual
decline over a period of time.‘

The apparent job glut is changing
the types of jobs available to law
school graduates, and future profes-
sionals may also have less ofa choice
in the geographic area where they
will work.

In the past, 50 percent ofthe grad-
uates of Pitt‘s law school graduates
found jobs in Allegheny county, and
80 percent remained within Pennsyl-
vania state lines. This picture may
change in the future because there is
a greater demand for lawyers in the
South and West, Fletcher said.

Many of the same observations
can be made for medical school
graduates.

Frances Drew, the Pitt medical

school's associate dean for student
affairs, said the job glut is not a

l

 

a .\In.

problem for graduates of the medi-
cal school at the moment. She said
60 percent of the graduates got their
first choice for a place to do their
residency, which is up from the pre-
vious year. “At the moment," she
said, “everything is stable.”

A look at the supply and demand
figures for physicians can lead to an
oversimplification of the problem.
In the past, medical school gradu-
ates tended to prefer certain spe-
cialty areas overa general practice.
As a result, statistics reveal there is
currently a job glut for some special-
ists, while there is still a need for
more family practitioners and pedi-
atrics physicians.

Howard Stambler, a spokesman
for the Department of Health and
Human Services, said in a
November I0, I983, Los Angeles

Times article that the doctor glut is
forcing physicians to rural areas.

He said doctors have preferred to
work in suburban areas, but now
they are being forced to look for
work further from metropolitan
centers. However, Stambler added,
physicians in rural areas will earn
nearly as much as their colleagues in
the suburbs. I

In Pitt’s Graduate School of Busi-
ness, 92 percent of the I983 gradu-

_ ates found jobs. Ellen Zonn, the

director of placement the business
school, explained that this figure is

roughly the same as it has been in the
past. She said graduates had to look
a little harder to findjobs but added
that the general trend of the econ-
omy also had an effect.

Like other professional fields,
Zonn said that MBAs are not hard
to place and are taking positions dif-
ferent from those of graduates in the
past. While some of the traditional
job titles in the business field have
more applicants than positions,
there are also new positions open-
ing, so the overall availability ofjobs
has remained fairly stable, accord-
ing to Zonn. ’

Fletcher said professional fields
like law are by no means the only
disciplines that seem to be glutted
according to the media.

“I think that it‘s going to be diffi-
cult for young professionals in every
field,“ she said. ‘.‘There are no open
fields."

Students, therefore, should not
choo_se.a career merely because of
predictions ofthe futurejob market,

Zonn said. They should, instead. 1;,

study what matches their interests
and proficiencies.

Psychologist
theorizes on

juvenile rt

delinquents

By Patti Sechan
The Pitt News

A Pitt psychologist, with the aid

of graduate students in the adminisri”

tration of justice program, has de-
veloped a new theory to explain the
causes of recurring juvenile delin-
quency.

Monroe J. Miller. a professor in
the University Center for Social and
Urban Research, explained his work
on Friday in a lecture, “The Timing
of Intervention in the Rehabilitation
of Juvenile Offenders." Miller‘s the-
ory. known as “Successful Adapta-
tion," uses a “positive" approach to
examine why some juveniles put an

end to their deliquency and others‘,

do not.
“Our work focuses on under-
standing the successful juvenile

adapter so that we can help other
offenders to become successful,“
Miller said.
This approach, Miller said.
attempts to find out whatit is that
has gone right with some juveniles
‘that enables them to avoid slipping
back into criminal behavior.
Miller‘s theory makes three
assumptions. First, thejuvenile who

changes successfully must do so by “L

intuitively learning new behavior
patterns. Second, the juvenile must
undergo some psychological
changes. And third, environmental
factors and support persons must
assist the learning and psychological
changes.

“A juvenile delinquent just
released from ‘an institution-type
setting is at his/her most crucial
stage,” according to Miller.

“In these first six months after
release, ajuvenile is most susceptibfij‘
to returning to criminal forms of
behavior. It is this time period that is
most crucial for follow-up sup-
ports,“ Miller said.

Miller contrasted the juvenile
delinquent with a student who has
“teacher-pleasing qualities, a stu-
dent who has the knack of always
saying and doing the right thing at
the right time."

“On the other hand," Miller said.

“the delinquent seems to always d3 _

the wrong thing at the wrong time. *

Miller said he feelsjuvenile delin-
quents lack the intuitive ability to
act properly in social situations and
therefore need to learn new patterns
of behavior.

USF L roundup...

In USFL action, the Michigan Panthers eluded the Arizona
Wranglers, 31-26, despite a 294-yard passing performance from Greg
Landry. The hosts outdueled Arizona on the arm of Bobby Hebert,
who drilled in three touchdown passes~—two on the Panthers‘ first two
"possessions of the game. Michigan led at halftime, I4—6, but was not
assured of a victory until safety David Greenwood grabbed an inte-
ception with :57 on the clock, securing the win.

Denver’s David Martin struck gold yesterday, returning an inter-
ception 38 yards for the winning touchdown in a 36-30 victory over
Tampa Bay. Gold quarterback Craig Penrosethrew one oftwo touch-
downs late in the fourth quarter, when the Bandits led 30-23. The TI)
pass to Leonard Harris and Martin's interception put away Tampa
Bay.

The P'

= A Tim Moersh/ The Pitt News

 St.’ Joseph’s Kevin Springman and his teammates were looking for victory, but
Boston College stopped the Hawks cold, 76-63.

I sieve: Moiid.¥y,' March 16:’ 19'3";

  Boston College

handles St. Joe’s

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News I

I’HII.AI,)El.I’HlA - The I983-
84 basketball season has been a dis-
appointing one for Boston College.
A teamthat finished inthe final lbof
the NCAA tournament in each of
the previous three years and was pre-
dicted to finifh second in the Big
East, the Eagles struggled to a less-
than fulfilling I7-II record.

After a one-point loss to St.
John‘s in the first round of the Big
East championship. Boston College
had to settle for a National Invita-
tional Tournament bid instead of a
return engagement to the NCAAs.

The inevitable letdown of missing
the big time may have been
overshadowed by an incident last

week. two days before the Eagles’

NIT game with St. Joseph‘s.

Senior forward Martin Clark.
who earlier this season was involved
in a shouting and pushing incident
with head coach Gary Williams.
promptly blasted Williams in a tele-
visioninterview after practice Wed-
nesday. When it was over. Clark had
quit the team.

The reaction by his teammates,

however, was not one of devasta-
tion. Boston College camc out Fri-
day night at the Palestra and played
like the teams of the last two years.
destroying the Hawks 76-03.

“I don‘t think I’ve ever been
happier after a win." Williams said.
“I don‘t think we have played a bet-
ter Qame this vear.

“I‘ve been proud of this team all
year. We’ve been involved with a lot
of close games and. have had some
problems off the court, but these
guys have always come to practice
ready to practice hard and always
are ready to play."

  with ease in NIT

Most ol the credit Williams gave
for getting the Eagles ready went to
co-captains Michael Adams and .lay
Murphy.

“The incident was something the
team had to accept.” he said of
Clark‘s departure, “We were strong
to accept, and Jay and Michael as
co-captains got the team ready to
play.”

Boston College displayed an up-
tempo offense and a full—court pres-
sure defense, true to the winning
formula of old. ,

After leading by two, 34-32 at
halftime, Boston College applied its
vise—grip press, resulting in a 22-9
run in the first six-and—a—half min-
utes in the second half. Twelve
points were the results of turnovers.

Murphy and Adams showed the
way true leaders in a time ofcrisis

Adams. a foot shorter than
Murphy. provided his typical
lighting—quick, out-of-control
energy from the point-guard posi-
tion. shooting nine for I3 from the
floor. grabbing five rebounds, pass-
ing for six assists and. most impor-
.tantly, creating six steals. .

“Michael played as good a game
as a coach can want a point guard to
play.” Williams said of Adams‘ per-
formance. “He was always getting
the ball to the right man.“

St. Joseph's head coach Jim Boyle

had a less complex explanation of

Adams. «

“We play a lot of teams that
quick.“ he said. “but maybe Adams
is quicker with the ball."

“Sometimes, I think I’ve got to
take it to the basket,“ Adams said.
“I’lI drive as close as I can and pass it
when I have to or take [the shot] ifl
can.“

Things have changed for Murphy
this "past season. With last year's
front line of 6-8 John Garris at the
post and the 6-9 Clark, Murphy was
able to stay outside and shoot away.
With Garris’ graduating and Clark‘s
on-again, off-again status, more was
expected from Murphy inside.

. All of that was predicated on one
of the smallest starting front lines in
major college basketball, with 6-4
forward Terrence Talley and 6-5,
center Roger McCready.

“I just have to give 100 percent,”
Murphy said. “It would be nice to
have more size and depth inside, but
Roger and Terrence did a greatjob.”

Talley had nine rebounds, and
McCready grabbed eight while scor-
ing I4 points, 12 from the charity
stripe.

When asked about this shooting
performance, M urphy replied, “This
was probably the best night I’ve ever
had."

Both Adams and Murphy admit-
ted the Clark conflict was a surpris-
ing move.

“The first time he came back, he
was a part of us again," Adams said.
“But the second time. it made us
more like a family."

“I feel the move threw us off,“
Murphy said.

While the co-captains said they
had no problems‘with Clark, Willi-
ams believes the move was intended
to harm the team's morale.

“The timing of this was right to
stick it to us," said Williams, who
learned of Clark's action at 6:45
Wednesday night.

“I was personally hurt. He came
back and was accepted as a part of
the team. He was practicing and
playing well.

“You do not go on television to
put us down.“

St. Joseph's center Tony Costner
was trying hisibest to dojust that on
the Palesta floor. The 6-I0 senior
center, who was criticized by the
media for lackluster play, hit 12 of
I4 from the field in scoring 29 points
to become St. Joseph's leading
scorer. I

In the second half, Costner made
all eight shots attempted, including‘
the last I0 of the Hawks‘ points.

But as hot as Costner was, the rest
of the Hawks were icy cold. After
halftime, without Costner, the team
shot four for 25. a pitiful I4 percent.

“I noticed that." Boyle said when
a reporter inquired about the
Hawks‘ lack of shooting punch.
“You get the open shots, and they
don’t drop. When the ball doesn‘t
drop, it usually means the other
team is doing something right on
defense."

And tournament time is the best
time to do things the correct way.
Boston College has made the final I6
in the NIT, but the Eagles obviously
will want more as they face Notre
Dame tomorrow night.

“The way we're playing," Adams
said. “we can take it all."

Netters fall to Bucknell

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

The Panther tennis team lost for
the fourth time in five outings when
Bucknell came to Oakland on Satur-
day and came away with a 6-3
victory. »

Pitt winners were Dave Johnson, '

in the number one singles match,
Rich Monteleone, in the number
five singles match, and the number
two doubles team of Jack Kalla and
Chuck Deveia.

Johnson beat Peter Ochroch 6-4,
6-I.

“I was very pleased with Dave
Johnson,” Pitt coach George Dief-
fenbach said. “He started off real
strong and played an impressive
consistent match. And he didn’t
waste any time."

Monteleone defeated Jim Beneke
6-3, 2-6, 6-4, while the doubles team

ousted the team of Beneke and Mike
Murphy 6-3, 6-7, 7-6.

Bucknell won four singles
matches, three of them in three sets.

“It’s hard to believe that Bucknell .

won three singles‘ three-set
matches," Dieffenbach said. “If we
had won one of those, we would
have entered the doubles matches in
a tie, and I think we could have won,
then." ‘I

Pitt plays host to Penn State
tomorrow at home. The Lions are
the third-ranked team in the Middle
States Tennis Association rankings.
The association comprises Pennsyl-
vania, Delaware, New Jersey and
part of West Virginia.

Pitt is unranked and a big
underdog.

“I hope that we can gain some
confidence from the Penn State
match,” Dieffenbach said. “We're
going to do everything that we can to
beat them, but it’s very difficult to
compete with a team of their
stature.” '

Penn   State tops
Panther gymnasts
to close season

By Charlie O'Hara -
The Pitt News '

b.

It seems that Pitt gymnastics
coach Frank D‘Amico is on the
brink of establishing his program as
one of the elite in the country.

Although the team was beaten by
third-ranked Penn State (279.05-

267.35) Saturday night at Trees Hall .

in the regular season finale,
I)‘Amico believes his program isjust
about where he dreamed it would be
eight years ago.

“We‘re so close now to biting on
Penn State,“ D‘Amico said. “Some
day soon we‘re going to get there.

“The score we had against Penn

State (267.35) would have gotten us .

to nationals four or five years ago.
We're improving every year as a
team, but gymnastics across the
country is improving also."

A perfect example of the sport's
improvement and Pitt’s improve-
ment can be seen in the Pitt-Penn
State game played Saturday night.

Pitt gymnasts Mark Klafter and
Matt Peters have rewritten the
school all-around
times during the course of the sea-
son. and Saturday, neither was able
to challenge Penn State's two-time
All-America Terry Bartlett. Bartlett,
a Southampton, England, native,
ran away with the all-around com-
petition by scoring a 57.l0.

Klafter and Peters were the only
Panthers to win or tie for individual
events. Klafter equaled Bartlett in
the floor exercise with a 9.65 mark.
while Peters got by everyone in the
high bar competition with a school
record—breaking performance of9.8.

“We added one more extremely"

difficult move to Matt's routine,“
D‘Amico said. “Its a release from an
eagle grip to a swinging one-armed
giant."

An eagle grip is a grip on the bar in
which the gymnast’s wrists are
turned about 180 degrees inward.

A one-armed giant is a swinging
routine in which the gymnast must
maintain his straight lines while
being supported by only one arm. it

‘We're so close now
to ' biting on Penn
‘State. Some day
soon we’re going to
get there.’

-Frank D’Amico

record several A

is a superior strength move. ‘and
when initiated with an eagle grip, it
makes it very difficult for the gym-
nast to maintain his fluidity and
flexibility.

Peters did it and was awarded the
outstanding score. a

Both Peters and Klafter appear to
be shoo—ins for the NCAA cham-
pionships at UCLA on April l2..To
qualify for the meet, the competitor
must rank in the top five of his

region. D'Amico said that senior‘

Dave Smith has an outside shot at
making it to the national champion-
ship, but is sitting behind a three-
way tie for fifth in the floor exercise.

The Lions were led by Bartlett,
who, aside from winning the all-
around title, captured three individ-
ual events — floor exercise, vault
and still rings.

Penn State’s Bob Stanley was

awarded a perfect l0.0 by one of the _

judges for his pommel horse routine.
It was the first time that anyone had
ever received a score of l0 at Pitt.

The Lionsjust had too many good
athletes for Pitt.

“They had scores in low 260‘s
twice this season because of major
breaks [falls] in routines,“ D'Amico
said.’ “We were hoping that that
would happen tonight. But they‘re
tough and deep.

“Actually. Carl [Schier, Penn
State‘s coach] has had a rough year,
but he just has so many good gym-
nasts that can just fill in and_ main-

tain a hell of a team score.“

Pitt ends its season at l3-3. while
Penn State finishes at ll-2.

Although the Panthers only shot 47 percent after
halftime, they ended the game hitting 58 percent (36
for 62). Four players hit double figures, with Clyde
Vaughan leading all scorers with 30 points and l0
rebounds. Chip Watkins added l8 points and I0
rebounds offthe bench, while guards George Allen ( I 7
points) and Billy Culbertson (l4 points) combined for
3! points. ’ ‘ T P 

“It was unbelievable,” Pitt head coach Roy Chip- - »
man said. “We may never shoot like that again. Any-
time you get a better shot, the more confidence you
get. We were running the offense well enough to
score.”

“We were playing good defense and didn't give any
easy shots,” LaSalle head coach Dave “Lefty” Ervin
said. “Yet, they scored six times out of IO.“

Despite the phenomenal shooting display, LaSalle
was able to make several runs at the Panthers.

The strength of the Explorers success came from
the inside play of center Albert Butts, who shot six for

for the game. Butts led the charge that took the Pitt _
lead from l0 to five after the first 20 minutes.

The Explorers exploded at the beginning of the
second half, outscoring Pitt 22-12 in the first seven
minutes and taking a 58-55 lead on a long, right—wing
jumper by forward Larry Koretz. who scored l4
points. '

But Friday night was not a typical night for the
Panthers.

“Tonight, we played as hard as we could, then we
just played harder,” said Panther point guard Billy
Culbertson, who redeemed himself for a poor perfor-
mance against Villanova a week earlier in the Big East
tournament; Culbertson scored l4 points and dished
out six assists. “Some of us were sucking air, but when
it got tough, we came back. '

“Its a tribute to the guys."

In the next five minutes, the Panthers ran off 16
unanswered points, six ofthem on LaSalle turnovers. ‘

Vaughan threw in several shortjumpers, and little-
used guard Joey David, playing hisbest game this
season, hit two medium—range jumpers. The Explor-
ers had problems mounting any offense.

During the l6-point Panther swing, LaSalle missed
five field goals, committed three fouls, goaltended and
turned the ball over three times.

The Explorers, praying for a miracle in the televi-
sion timeout, never received it; they called their own
timeout at the 7:24 mark after David’s l8-footer made
it 71-58. _

Strong offensive rebounding by Butts and forward

and I5 rebounds, cut the lead to four with three min-
utes left, but the Panthers made l5 of I7 foul shots in
the waning minutes, insuring last night‘s second-
round game with Florida State. -  —~ A . “

Panthers advance in NIT

March 19, I984

GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Pitt
defeated Florida State, 66-63,
last night in the second round of
the National Invitation
Tournament.

Clyde Vaughan led the Panth-
ers with 25 points. Guard George
Allen added 17 and center Keith
Armstrong 10.

“I think the key was being able
to contain Alton Lee Gipson
[Florida State's center],” Pitt
assistant coach Reggie Warford
said of the Seminoles high-

scoring big man. Gipson was

held to 12 points.and ﬁve-for-19
shooting from the floor.

The Panthers (18-12) shot 42
percent from the field and 70 per-
cent from the free throw line. Pitt
advances to the quarterﬁnals; the
location and opponent, possibly
Fitzgerald Field House, will be
announced today.

George Allen hit two free
throws with 3:06 remaining to
put Pitt up by four, 62-58.

Joey David called a timeout
when no teammate was available
to receive his inbounds pass.

Pitt edges Florida State

Afterward, David's passed was
kicked around before Culbert-
son secured the loose ball.
Culbertson then ﬁred a spec-
tacular around-the-back pass to
an unexpecting David, who lost
it out of bounds. Florida State's
Vince Martello was fouled and
made just one of two foul shots
with 15 seconds left. Following a
Vaughan rebound, Culbertson
was fouled and made both ends
of the one-on-one situation to
put the game on ice.

By Scott Dellett

PHILADELPHIA The bomb
was ticking. The 4.127 l,aSalle fans
at the Palestra Friday night in the
first round of the National Inviti-
tional Tournament were patiently
waiting for the Panther basketball
team to self—dcstruct.

It happened several times this
year. Pitt would put on a superb
basketball display for a short period
of time and promptly collapse.

The Panthers did not fall apart.
There were opportunities ~ like
when center Keith Armstrong
received his third personal foul
within the first five minutes of the

  
  
     

Tim .Moers}z/ The Pitt News

game. only playing ll more minutes
before fouling out. Perhaps Andre
Williams‘ fourth foul at l5:Ol in the
second half would put the Panthers
out of the NIT. Maybe missed foul
shots would seal doom for Pitt.
But none of those things hap-
pened Friday night. Pitt put on its
best offensive display of the season
in the 95—9l win over the Explorers.

The Panthers. who have shot only
42 percent from the field throughout
the campaign. transformed them-
selves into excellent shooters
overnight.

In the first half, the Panthers shot
7 I .4 percent (20 for 28). For the first
I6 minutes alone, Pitt only missed
three of 21 attempts.
