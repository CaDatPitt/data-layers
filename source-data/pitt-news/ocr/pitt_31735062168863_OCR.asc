The reaction of American academici-
ans to the unrest of their students recalls
the frustrations and confusions of ‘parents
when their once—docile children reach the
rebellious years of adolescence. At first
they cannot accept such behavior (un-
grateful brats”) -and shut their eyes to it.
When the thrust of protest become so se-
vere as to force recognition, a period of
rationalizations and excuses are forward-
ed to justify the status-quo. When these
devices fail to quell the rebellion a pain-
ful self-examination is necessitated in
which the possibility of falability must be
entertained. Often the embattled parties
join together at this stage and thrash out
their grievances together—a process that
will hopefully lead to a resolution of con-
flict satisfactory and beneficial to all.
Often this period of self-examination,
combined with discussions between the
contesting parties, can lead to a new ma-
turity among individuals and more effec-
tive interaction between them.

The University family is currently in
turmoil. Student protesters can no longer
be ignored or passed off with such ex-
cuses as “they’re frustrated over‘ world
events” or “they’re commies, kooks or out
for kicks.” The painful period of self-ex-
amination has begun at all levels within
the University and, in the long run, Amer-
ican education . will , be -.ne'tt,er..,because of
it. It is this consideration alone that legi-

‘timizes the protesters: they are responsi-

ble for stimulating the University dia-
logue. \

As an academician I have done my
share of soul-searching. Pinpointing the
source of student unrest was no easy task-
it was not until I ”put myself in the stu-
dents place” that I located a possible
source of the problem. In my opinion, a
basic reason for current student unrest is
a dissatisfaction with university teaching.
Put another way, student protest is a teach-
ing protest—an objection to professorial
behavior at the focal point of student—fac-
ulty interaction-—the classroom.

I recalled an educational psychology
final examination in my undergraduate
days that asked the question: “If millions
of dollars are allocated yearly in the search
for superior teaching procedures in our
primary and secondary schools what ef-

forts are being made to improve teaching
at the University level?” “There is no
teaching at the University level” was one
student’s response. Such a criticism is not
uncommon among undergraduates. In one
of my own courses I asked a group of 12
seniors I to list any courses where the
teacher taught well enough to make the
l e c t u r e s “worthy of voluntary atten-
dance.” Only three seniors could remem-
ber any such -courses, and then only one
apiece. .

Such a state of affairs should not sur-
prise the attentive academician. Profes-
sors are human—they expend their ener-
gies where the payoffs are greatest—and in
higher education payoffs are not great for
teaching. Such a state of affairs might sur-
prise a student. however. His primary con-
tact with the University is through his pro-
fessors: they are his major vehicle for
learning as well. Is it any wonder the stu-
dent expects the faculty members to have
but one role—that of the teacher. When
an instructor is disinterested in his class-
es. or. worse, slipshod and negligent is it
any wonder the student feels alienated
from the University community? I would

suspect a computerized identification card ‘

and impersonalized administration is mild-
ly annoying to a student when compared
with a lackluster, “I don’t give a damn”
‘teacher. And many teachers don’t give a‘
damn. One undergraduate described it
this way: “It’s not a student revolution
for power it’s a‘ student revulsion for pro-
fessors."

Of course, the professor can’t be ‘giv-
en full blame for the sad condition in the
classroom. Teaching is a combination of
skill and art: proficiency requires both
training and interest. Can one expect the
academician to exhibit either in an en-
vironment where teacher training is ridi-
culed and the classroom role is subordi-
nate to the publication “of scholarly arti-
cles‘? One professor summarized the di-
lemma aptly: “Why should I teach? Who
knows how to—and who has time!'Besides,
I’m paid and promoted on the basis_of pub-
lication, not oratory. One article is’ worth
a thousand lectures."

If I am correct in my assumption that
poor teaching is responsible for student
unrest then something must de done—and
done quickly—to remedy the situation.
The teacher must be given the tools of rec-
ognition required to turn_ him from a
clockwatcher to a catalyst—churning up
interest and‘ excitement in each student
for the topic he is discussing. He must un-

ToTeach orNotToTeach—ARea1Di1emma

by JUDI GALARDI

“Riots are spontaneous and un-
premeditated outbursts of vio-
ence,” said Dr. Ralph W. Conant
last Wednesday. In contrast Dr.
Conant defined civil insurrection
as “a deliberate rebellion to put
down persons in power, to force
abandonment of obnoxious poli-
cies or to force the adoption of
desirable ones. Insurrection -is a
premeditated attempt.”

“The insurrectionist is not out
to overthrow the system, because
he will settle for some specific-
adjustmentin the system. The in-
surrectionist is not a revolution-.
ary, since he is willing toaccept ..
the changes he works for. The  .

derstandg that lecturing from a textbook is
not enough—the student can read the vol-

. ume on his own; selecting relevant read-

ings is not enough—the student can obtain
the bibliography on his own; presenting a
critique of what is read and evaluatiing its
merit is important—but not enough. The
teacher must instill in his students a love
of learning, a desire to ponder and ques-
tion, an intellectual exuberance——without
transmitting such desires, the academici-
an can not hope to develop productive
offspring and faces extinction.

How does one go about improving the
quality of teaching? One suggestion has
already been hinted at: improve the pay-
off for teaching excellence. Such incen-
tives as increased salary, reduced publica-
tion requirements, job advancement and
public recognition for exceptional teach-
ers should increase the quality of teaching’
rapidly enough! The problem of identify-
ing better teachers is a problem, of course,
but not insoluable. Way back in 1954 the
National Student Association published a
pamphlet concerned with the evaluation
of undergraduate instruction——and since
that time an ever-growing number. of col-
leges and universities are using course
evaluation of undergraduate instruction—
and since that time an ever-growing num-
ber of colleges and universities are using
-course evaluation as a means of assessing
teaching excellence. Recently, education-
psychologists have agreed that improve-
ment in -teaching is possible and desirable
and that students have the ability to aid in
this progress. F. H. Burkhardt, discussing

The College and the Student (1966), feels .-
that “. . . It is no doubt more difficult to ‘

than of his research and publications but 
it is not impossible. In fact some of our ,
liberal arts colleges that prize the qual-.,ﬁ*'

liable measures of assessment . . . the fact

is that students are capable of intelligent V. V
and responsible judgments about teaching 
and can be of enormous assistance to a;:
teacher in improving the effectiveness of ‘ 
his instruction.”  ‘

A second procedure for bolstering the.- 
quality of college instruction is allowing’. 
students to learn what they want to -learn ,' ',
and faculty to teach what they want to i‘ ‘
teach. This is accomplished by allowing 1
students‘ a voice in the determination of"
the University curriculum-—a right to ini-_

an active role in the learning process as.

“Pot Bust”: Modern Day Witch Hunts?

By PAUL ST. JOHN

It seems that more and more
people are getting arrested these
days. Whether its a “pot bust"
or getting picked up at a demon-
stration. thenumber of arrests
is rapidly rising. It is safe to say
that the majority of people arrest-
ed are middle class college stu-
dents.

What effect will these arrests
have on their future? Some have
been‘ involved in protests for
years: arrested in the south for
civil rights activity, in the north
for anti-war demonstrations.
on campus for almost anything.
and on the streets for being in

the wrong place at the wrong
time.

It‘s impossible to tell how many
college-educated middle class
youths have established records
since it all began. Several hun-
dred were arrested at the Demo-
cratic National Convention alone.
not to mention several thousand
arrested in demonstrations all
over the country.

Drug arrests are almost as
common as traffic tickets. Pos-
sessing long hair and an apart-
ment is practically a written in-
vitation to the‘ local narcotics
squad. It Just think of all that pub-
licity: sure looks good for the au-

thorities. ridding the neighbor-
hood of those dirty hippies. Ever
notice how they crack down dur-
ing the month preceding local
elections?)

So the best educated. best cared
for generation of middle class
youths in our country’s history is
probably going to have the most
impressive record of arrests.

What do you do with the young
man or woman with a master’s
degree or a Ph.D. who has been
in jail a couple times? What do
you do when potential employees
casually mention they have
“criminal" records? A

Many of these people get involv-
ed in social or welfare work or

teaching. There is a rapid turn-

over, many jobs are available
and most employers‘ will ignore
most protest type arrests.

But what about a drug arrest?
Will future employers be open-
minded enough to view the in-
dividual circumstances or refuse
to consider hiring anyone involv-
ed in such goings-on‘? -It doesn’t
seem likely that the ,“Seagrams
Seven” generation will be in a
hurry to hire any subversive
hippy radicals (drug law offend-

ers). Maybe our generation will
be more tolerant.

But that is not the real problem
and neither is waiting 20 years
for conditions to improve the so-
lution. The. problem is in the ex-
istence of puritannical, illogical
drug laws, based more on myth
and superstition than scientific
evidence and fact; laws which
make potential criminals out of
some 25% of American college
students: laws which make it pos-
sible for the occasional mari-
juana smoker to be arrested and
sentenced to many years injail;
forced to associate with murder-
ers, rapists, thieves, and hard-
core drug addicts; laws which
should be closely reexamined and
either drastically changed or
completely abolished.

Seek Exchange 0;‘ Ideas

UCIR To Develop

Research

Seminars

A major concern of the University Center for International
Research (UCIR) will be the development of International

Research Seminars. The seminars will be generated by UCIR and

also from faculty requests. The Program, which will meet in late
November, Policy Committee of UCIR will decide which pro-

grams will be supported.

Seminars are expected to meet
the following criteria: (1) The
topic is one to which participat-
ing faculty have demonstrated a
major academic commitment so
that research and publications
can result from the seminar. (2)
The topic is relevant to a specif-
ic theme in the
field- (3) The topic involves
faculty of more than one depart-
ment or school. (4) The topic is
one in which graduate students
are developing dissertations.
(5) The seminar could become part
of the regular curriculum.

The UCIR’s hope is to create

~ ways for scholars with converg-

ing interests to benefit from re-
gular exchange of ideas. Ideally.
UCIR envisions a small number
of faculty and graduate students
meeting for discussion in seminar
style. During this period the
participants would be pursuing
research on the topic of the
seminar. These endeavors should
produce publications or research
projects. _

Higher education is in the grips of a dilemma—a dilemma

I ‘ that threatens to erode the foundations and principles of,
‘ university education.

’ University Social Psychologist Marvin Karlins makes us
‘ painfully aware of ‘the problems that beset this institution.
These are not problems ofstudent power. administration
power, or vacuous power, but problems of teaching power-
the communication of exciting and mind stimulating ideas
from professor to student.

Teaching methods at this University, ‘heretofore, have
been plagued by a warped. sense_ of pI‘l0I‘lt1e‘S‘. And that dis-
torted sense was, and still is, initiated by the publish or per-
ish principle.” All too often, members of the faculty look be-
yond their classrooms into the prestige world of _sc_hol_arly
publications. Academicians are ranked not on their individ-
ual teaching and communicative abilities, but on their abil-
ity to get published. This phenomona is unfortunately cou-
pled to the concept of tenure. Once a professor has published

 » a number of works, his employment security is almost beyond

question.

‘All too often, professors simply don’t give a damn about
the welfare or interest of their students. Undergraduates are
often neglected in favor of obscure academic interests. And
all of this is the result of the system of scholarly advance-
ment, and the existing prerequisites "of “prestige” in the aca-
demic world. In fact, manyof the notable and prestigious
academicians are poor teachers.

tional quagmire. And day by day we’ are sinking closer and
closer to the point of no return. Professo_r Karlins, however,
is wise enough to suggest some alternatives that could ulti-
mately remedy the situation. Karllnssays incentives such as
“increased salary, reduced publication requirements, _plus
job advancement and public recognition for exceptional
teachers should increase the quality of teaching rapidly . . .”

A second alternative mapped by Karlins is to let “stu-
dents learn what they want to learn, and teachers teach what
they want to teach. This is accomplished,” says Karlinsk “by
.allowing students a voice in the determination of Universi-
ty curriculum——a right to initiate courses and select faculty
to teach them.” (If the member of the faculty voluntarily
agrees to do so.) Karlins argues that such a proposal would
‘allow the faculty to teach courses with exciting material to '*
‘a group of “interested students.” Such a proposal has been

;ment has been successful, for the students met the responsi-
bility of structuring a course. Both the faculty and the stu-
.dents at Princeton are satisfied with the program.

There are, of course, some exceptional “teachers” at this
University—men who are very much «concerned about the
communication of exciting ideas. But there are exceptions to
every rule. These few men, however, do not counterbalance
the multitude of “third-rate teachers” who ritualistically lec-
ture from day to day in the same disinterested monotone.

‘ For these reasons, The Pitt News believes that an educa-
tional experiment is in order. We don’t think the educational
structure at this University should be leveled. Rather than
taking this drastic measure, we urge the individual depart-
ments to take measures to create informal student-faculty
committees that would set up courses of instruction. We real-
ize that a movement of this sort has already been initiated.
But it is high time for this institution’ to reap the mutual

-benefits of faculty-student interests in instructional exper-

tise.

Let us hope the day never comes when the dull human-
professor will be replaced by the fascinating. inhuman com-

The Way I See It *

Do What You Have To, Students,
To Be Programmed Eor Society

by DAVE TIERNAN
Staff News Editor

“What an ass,” a.well-dressed male student I

commented while filing out of the Field House
after Dick Gregory‘s appearance the other night.
“He should have stuck to being a commedian. Look
at all those people who were here tonight.” the fel-
low said to his friend. “They would have paid good
money to have seen him. And I’m sure as hell that
he won’t get any votes in the election

Although I didn’t bother to in-
form the guy in front of me that
I felt he was wrong. and that I
thought his opinion was one of
utter ignorance. I did think how
typically “Pitt" his feelings were.

He was wrong in his opinion
for two reasons. In the first place.
Gregory‘s oratory expressed his
concern for the sick nation that
America has become. and he is TIERNA
therefore in a better position to speak to the youth
of America about change, than to stand in front of
millions of adults each year and make them laugh
at themselves.

 

IN THE SECOND place, Gregory will receive
many votes this year—-even if they are merely votes
of confidence from students across the nation that
appreciate someone telling them the truth for the
first time in their lives. -

I couldn’t help but feel that the guy in front of
me was a shining example-of the student who would
attend lecture after lecture by a boring professor.
regurgitate trivial facts on his tests, and receive a
grade that would push him closer to graduation.
even though he questioned the professor’s ability
to teach, found the course absurd. and the material
irrelevant to his education.

Gregory encouraged the youth of today to con-
tinue their challenge of the society in which they
live. He pointed to the American history book as an
example of how the student of today is programmed
to learn material the way society. through adminis-
tration and faculty, wants him to learn it.

BUT I AM sure Gregory’s words fell on deaf
ears. ears of students who felt that he should stick
to being a comedian. for how many students here
ever stop to evaluate the quality of education they
are getting? I don’t mean complaining or critising
—I mean really weighing the material they are
forced to learn against the material they want to
learn in a class.

In a school where seniors can count on one hand‘
the number of excellent classes and teachers they
have had. there is a definite need for evaluation
and improvement. “But those old,fools are afraid of
change." Gregory said of the politicians in power

  

today. and the same is true of the majority or our

professors here. But they sure as hell aren’t going’

to change unless some pressure is applied from the
students. As long as the ‘students accept a third-rate
education. that's exactly what they’re going to get.

Gregory pointed to the policemen in America as
the new nigger. They get the blame from both sides,
but receive little or no.thanks and still remain un-
derpaid. Well, do you know who the nigger here
is? It’s the groups like Student Government. Men’s
Dorm Council, The Pitt News. The administration
scoffs at these groups. the faculty View them as ut-
ter wastes of time. and the students look at them
through critical eyes. If students here analysed.
criticized and discussed the ‘shortcomings of their
teachers half as much as they do to the niggers.
then “those old fools" would be in for some drastic
change.

BUT NO, THE students here take out the frus-
trations of a third-rate education on the niggers.
There are other minority groups that receive abuse.
too. The dormies ridicule the commuters. the
Greeks look down their noses at the independents,
and on and on the students go, practicing all the
prejudice and moral sickness that they will need to

cope with society.

Students here have been programmed; trained
to criticize without taking action: trained to attend
boring lecture after boring lecture; trained to be-
come critical, "do—only—what-you-have-to-do—to—get—
by" adults. And they will fit right into society: into
its third-rate job slots, into its status-conscious sub-
urbs, into its overcrowded mental institutions. into

its divorce courts. Yes, they will fit right in.

The highlite of Gregory’s talk came when he
urged every student to carry a copy of the Declara-
tion. of Independence. and when the riot season he-
gins, can all the “old fools”. down to watch the TV
and when they start to ask questions like “What’s
wrong with those people?" the students should turn
the sound of the TV off and read the Declaration.
Ittwas a very effective point, one that can be ap-
plied here at the University.

A DECLARATION OF students’ ‘rights to a de-
cent education should be carried by-all students.
and when the endless droning of intolerable profes-
sors reaches its crescendo. the students should rise

1 and read their rights to the professor.

One thing that Gregory pointed out time and
time again was that it is the responsibility of the stu-
dent to change the society in which he lives. But.
between the lines of his talks was a subtle indica-
tion that students will join the “old fools” before‘
they try to lick them.

And, Mr. Gregory, I agree with you one hun-
dred per cent.

Editor. Pitt News:

I AM DISGUSTED WITH MY-
SELF! This statement is one that
the majority of we students
should make. myself included.

We have been clamoring for a
chance to be heard. an opportu-
nity to voice our opinions before

the administration. The adminis- -

tration proved receptive to our
wants and gave us our opportu-
nity to air our differences in the
form of a widely publicized
“Speak Your Peace Conference."
in the Student Union Ballroom on
Saturday. October 12. We blew
it! The majority of us stayed
away. Approximately 50 students
demonstrated enough concern to
come.

Sure, we want a say in how
“Our” University is run. as long
as we don’t have to expend any of
our valuable energy in order to
get it.

It was stated in a recent letter
to the editor that Mr. Paul Stol-
ler does not have the right to
speak for the majority of the stu-
dents in his editorials. Well who
is to say that Mr. Stoller is not
representative of the students‘?

How many people said that they
disagreed with him? It is about
time ‘that we. the majority. be-
gin to express our views: wheth-
er we agree with Mr. Stoller or
not. We must wake up and face
the realization that complain-
ing amongst ourselves will do
little good. If we want action then
we must take our opinions and
views before those who can do
something for us.

Take a quick glance at the pic-
ture of Dr. Jack Critchfield on
page one of Monday's Pitt News.
I sense a feeling of utter disap-
pointment. The administrators
have done their best to exhibit
their good-will toward the stu-
dents. and we have let them
down. Weican’t even muster up
enough energy to get off our rear
ends and say what wefeel when
we are given the chance to do it.
And yet, we will continue to crit-
icize them for their “Lack of
Receptiveness" to student wish-
es. Let’s face it. if we want
something done. we must get to-
gether and do it. For if we don’t.
who will? V

 Ex—fan Raps Team

hi-

‘-

Editor. The Pitt News: ‘

As a Pitt fan since 1936, sea-
son ticket holder since the early
50s. yet seen every home game
with the exception of time in
the service. since 1941 I would
like to protest the disgusting.
disgraceful football situation
at Pitt. At the current rate this
year’s team yields points they
should establish some sort of

_modern record with 500 or better.
So far in four games they are
averaging 38.5 with State. Mi-
ami. and the hungry Irish yet to
come. Offense wise in the Syra-
cuse game the longest ground
gain was six. netting three yds.
gain for the whole game. They
have yet for the first time to stop
a third down situation. not once.
I have been a die hard Panther
fan through the years when I
considered three wins and six
losses a winning season. But I've
had it. in the last 28 years since
1940 this will be the twentieth
losing season. and that's count-
ing the ’62 5-5 record as a win-
ner. To get into the coaching I
guess is ridiculous. if the coach's
name was Sutherland. Rockne.
Warner or Joe Blow. if he turned
out teams with one or two wins
that' would be it. How much do
you expect Pitt fans to stom-

ach? The Panthers are the laugh
of football. They haven’t scored
200 points a season for 30
years. This losing is getting sick-
ening, the fan doesn't care‘ if the
tight end or quarterback has two
years of a foreign language. We
are the same as the people at
East Lansing or Columbus and
South Bend. all we want is a part
time winner not a continuous
loser. How much do you expect‘?
Twenty out of 28 loser good grief.
Unless you keep Penn State. W.
Va. and the Irish on your home
card you'll be lucky to get 5000
spectators soon. Losing is not
all bad. it‘s the ridiculous man-
ner in which this has become a
habit. by 30 to 50 points a game.
Each year we hear about the up
and coming Sophs. yet the habit
continues. No other major college
has such pitiful records as Pitt
the past five wins. 33 defeats
and two ties. I think all the ‘ticket
holders should wise up. We‘ve
waited too long. The administra-
tion doesn't care. why should
we?

Subtle Protest

Editor. The Pitt News": .

It seems that “students" have
finally found the answer to all
problems — from civil rights to
traffic lights. Demonstrate!
Could we be in a rut‘? Let's face
it. demonstrations are being over-
used. They are too commonplace
to attract-attention.

May I suggest a slightly un-
orthodox move in our quest
against City Hall? Why don't
we organize‘ a volunteer traffic
patrol. perhaps outfitted with
psychedelic safety flags‘? This
would still be protest. but a subtle.
and ongoing one. AND. it may

"give the reader a better idea of
how teaching can be improved
*by a student initiated-course sys-
tem.

 In the Spring of 1967, the
;-Princeton faculty gave two groups
of disgruntled undergraduates
[permission to initiate .courses of
their own design for full Univer-
.sity credit. The intention of the
“students was to establish a sys-
tem whereby topics of current un-
“dergraduate concern could be re-
flected in University course of-
ferings. The intention of the ad-
_ministration was to test student
‘responsibility, to see if the stu-
dents would display the level of
academic maturity necessary to
‘justify participation in curricu-
lum planning. ’
5 One course. The History of Uto-
:.;pian Thought, was conducted last
,_;fall. Twelve students with varied
academic backgrounds partici-
-pated. They decided what books
. they would read. what topics they
would discuss. when they») would
wmeet and how they would be

discussed topics among them-
selves; other times guest speakers
were invited to conduct seminars
on specialized topics. In addition.‘
classes were open to the public.
.Fr_i’ends of participants and inter-
“rested students were welcome to
join in class discussions.
The second course. Psychology
and Society, was structured (by
U. the students) a bit differently

 Classroom Rental and Proc-

minimize the possibilities for
},-classroom cheating, the College
provides funds for the employ-
jment of special proctors when,
"in? the opinion of the instructor,
“they are needed during major
examinations. Such funds were
first made available during the

‘ and are again available for 1968-

from the first. There were more
participants in the group (15). and
mos_t were psychology -ma_jors.
There was also a’ greater em -
phasis on "cross fertilization of
ideas." that is. professors from
outside the psychology depart-
ment were" invited to provide a
different approach to psycholog-
ical issues. Speakers included a
professorof law. a physician. a
distinguished historian of physi-
cal sciences. an economist. a
NASA behavioral science advi-
sor. an expert on rhetoric and a
student of Buddhism.

The results of the seminars sur-
prised everyone, including the
students themselves. Undergrad-
uates did not “take advantage"
(terminology employed by tradi-
tional educators) of their free-
doms. Attendance at meetings was
excellent, and the exchange of
ideas was unusually intense and
fruitful, often lasting well beyond
the time allocated for the class.
In evaluating the Psychology and
Society course, one student wrote:

"The seminar attacked some is-
sues which are especially impor-
tant to people of our age._ . .This
is the essence of what education
should be: it should confront the
issues relevant to students instead
of being content with the dispas—
sionate study of areas which do
not really arouse the emotional
involvement which is so neces-
sary to meaningful education."

A visiting professor to the sem-
inar gave this evaluation:

should be counted as proctors for
each of the next 50 students be-
fore a request should be made to
this office for added proctors. The
number of graduate assistants
assigned by the department to a

ublish Or Perish?

..“I came away feeling that the

course, conceived, planned, and
administered by undergraduates
opened new vistas for student ini-
tiative in the Princeton curricu-
lum and was a telling demonstra-
tion of creative ingenuity by un-
dergraduates ‘in seeking to define
the relations between their own
departmental studies and the
studies and interests of other
fields.”

Based on the success of these
two student seminars. Princeton
plans to feature/such student ini-
tiated courses as a permanent part
of the curriculum. Five student
seminars; including Black -Ameri-
can Writers and The University
Ideal, are being offered in 1968.

So muchfor suggestions to im-
prove teaching. Without such im-
provements the University will
continue tci,fall short in fulfilling
its major obligation: the educa-
tion of its students. Whether or
not current student unrest is pri-
marily a product of poor. instruc-
tion is a matter of conjecture..l
firmly believe it is a contributing
factor. My recommendation is
that immediate steps be taken to
improve the quality of classroom
instruction and see if this has any
effect on the student, rebellion.

Violence Expert

Ralph Conant
Defines Rebellion

Continued from Page 1)

few was ordered early enough to
prevent large crowd gatherings
and the National Guard summon-
ed. the disturbances can be con-
trolled."

“Studies being conducted cur-
rently at the Lemberg Ce nte r
show that in most instances. po-
lice violence toward ghetto resi-
dents precedes and supersedes
ghetto violence." continued Dr.
Conant. "The avoidance of both
under-control and over—control is
a matter of police training for
riot control. This was the deliber-
ate pattern of police action in sev-
eral cities. notably Pittsburgh.
following the assasination of Mar-
tin Luther King.

Concerning our present system,
Dr. Conant stressed that “any
democratic system s ho uld be
formed in such a way that it can
absorb civil disobedience from
within, a n d solve th e problem

‘ through compromise. It is viable

in that it is resilient and flexible
in handling. cross pressures justly.
This must apply to all levels of
government.”

Six circumstances under which
non—violent civil disobedience is
justifiable were outlined by Dr.

, Conant.

1. When the oppressed groupis
deprived of lawful channels for
remedying its condition.

2. As a means of refusing to par-
ticipate in an obvious and intoler-
able evil perpetrated by civil au-
thoritites—for example. a policy of
genocide or slavery.

3. When government takes or
accepts actions that are inconsis-
tant with values on which the so-
ciety_and the political system are
built.

4. When is is certain that the
law or policy in question violates
the constitution of the govern-
ment.

-.3. When a change in law or po-
licy is demandedby social or eco-
nomic need of the community and
the normal procedures of law and
politics are inadequate. obstruct-
ed or controlled by a n t i l e g a l
forces.

6. When the actions of govern-
ment have become so obnoxious to
the individuals personal ethic s
that he would feel hypocritical in
abiding by this law.

"Civil disobedience under these

circumstances may be regarded
as obligatory in the terms of the

- highest principles of being a citi-

zen.“ stated Dr.'Conant. “It is the
individuals right to refuse to go
along with the community. but
the community must specify the
consequences."

According‘ to Dr. Conant, vio-

lence in civil disobedience is jus- .

tifiable when:

1. There is absolutely no other
way. and violence is the instru-
ment of last resort. _

2. The cause is regarded as a
just one in terms of our deeply
held egalitarian values.

/

3. The goals of freedom. liber-
ty and justice are either destroy-
ed or deleted.

When asked about the contin-
uation of the riots. Dr. Conant re-
plied. “We of‘ the Lemberg Cen-
ter forsee an increasing amount of
school disorders. We also see an
increasing amount of deliberate
attacks or acts of insurrection.
Overreastion —- brutality or wall-
ton killing — would stir up the
movement. rather than quiet it."

MDC Suggests ‘Litchfield Towers’;
Outlines Judicial Board Proposal

Lackluster attendance, a re-

new proposal for a judicial board

were all involved in Wednesday
evening’s meeting of the Men’s
Dormitory Council.

There were a few important
announcements made. Coach
Dave Hart has agreed to speak
in the dormitories in two weeks,
the date and time to be announc-
ed later. The dormitories have
purchased two televisions and
as soon as suitable arrangements
can be made, they will be put in-
to operation. Other announce-
ment
'ments were that Panther House
won dormitory softball. Dormi-
tory football starts soon. Dorm
Weekend tickets will be on sale
in two weeks. The newly organiz-
ed Food Service Committee will
meet Tuesdays at 3 p.m.

John Davaluchy, chairman of
the Judicial Board Committee,
briefly outlined the new pro-
posal for the Judicial Board.
“It is now a trial board. and no
longer a sentencing board,” Cav-
aluchy commented. There was no
discussion and no motion; rather,
Cavaluchy urged all Senators to
take the ‘proposal to their houses
and have them consider it.

President Nick Gervase an-
nounced that the Social Commit-
tee, after three lengthy meet-
ings, still has not approved the
new social rules due to the fact

that many necessary provisions
have not been included. Gervase
said that these provisions would
be added as soon as possible and
that the rules in toto would be sub-
mitted to the Social Committee
for passage at their next meet-
ing. Since these rules will not be
in effect before Homecoming,

that there be dorm-wide open
house during Homecoming for the
hours — Friday, 10-1, Satur-
day,4-6:30.

Pitt News’ Review

‘Grains’

Just back from their Canadian
tour where their single, Passing
Through the Night, reached num-
ber eight on the charts (CFRA
Radio, Ottawa), the “Grains of
Sand” are busy preparing for
their November recording ses-
sions with Epic.

The group formerly consisted
of four members but has recent-
ly switched to a three piece band.
The members are Rich Engler,
drummer; Max Kendrick, guitar-

ist: and Jerry Yetman, playing-

bass guitar. 1

A few months ago the Grains
concentrated ‘on top 40 songs
but have recently switched to the
underground sounds, concentrat-
ing on psychedelic and hard rock.
They have played at a few Uni-
versity parties and have already
appeared on the nation-wide tele-
vision program,.Upbeat. Also a
testament to their growing pop-
ularity is the existence of two

time are children of the British
aristocracy and they are shown
at work. earning slightly more
than the_ minimum wage
($300,000,000 a job sometimes).

That’s great work if you can get
it and in Duffy we meet the peo-
ple who can. James Fox plays one
of them — Stephane, a young
turned-on nobleman who can drop

out so much as a “Blimey”. .

Duffy, an underworld hippie en-

unsuspecting benefactor is none
other than Stephane’s father
(James Mason). an unscrupulous_
tycoon who has managed to bilk
the two .brothers out of the bulk
of their inheritances.

that I can blab and not ruin the

about half of the film.

The other and more interest-

how these wealthy flower chil-

nticipates N acvy Pass

by MARTHA HARTLE

Tomorrow at Navy, George Pribish will be starting his third
"me at the prowler position on the Panther ‘defense. and the
j'unior_.from Central City couldn’t be happier with his new as-
gnment.

 “I like the prowler position because I'm starting there.” comment--
Pribish. “The prowler is essentially a cross between a linebacker and a

defensive halfback. You have to be quicker than a linebacker. but

—'"ou’re more responsible for running plays instead of just concentra-

ting on the pass.”

Pribish. who started the season
. . defensive halfback. moved
‘ ver to prowler before the Wil-
am and Mary game and he‘s
een a starter there ever since.
-Dave Dibbley, the original prow-
r. moved into the deep second-

‘The coaches throught Dave
‘would be better at cornerback
‘than’ at prowler,” continued
ibish. “He did a real good job
here last year. So when he moved
_iito the secondary, the coaches
‘needed somebody to take over at
Zprowler. I guess they thought I
1 could do’ the job.”

>At 5'11”. 185 pounds, Pribish is
_ mall" for a linebacker. but he
'doesn’t consider his size to be a
andicap. “It might hurt a little
it.” he explained. “but not
ffmuch. The more important fea-
ture at prowler is that you’re
, uicker than a linebacker."

With the use of the prowler in
he defense. the Panthers employ
,a three—deep secondary instead of
3 the traditional four-deep set—up.
fvvito the fourth man in the secon-
_dary becomingthe prowler. “We
6 bought we had the personnel to
,-{play a three-deep secondary.“

Pribish continued. “It’s not as
—_‘ complicated as a four and it’s used
by a lot of other big-time schools
like Notre Dame. UCLA and Penn
 ‘State. ’ ’

Pribish was quick to admit that
"the" defense has not played up to
- potential this year. He attributes
, the prous defense to both the
1-lack of a good rush up front and
; to‘ mistakes in the secondary.

mistakes. We have good athletes
in the secondary. but we're not
putting it all together. Lack of

ther defense will have to put'it
all together tomorrow to stop the
Navy passing game if they hope
to come home, with a victory.

“We expect them to throw,” he
added, “because they know we've
haven’t done too good so far
against the pass. We won't be
doing anything special on de-
fense; we’ll be set up the same
as we have been all year, but we’re
going to have to stop their throw-
mg.”

With a number of regulars side-
lined with injuries. there will be
a lot of new faces in the line-up
tomorrow. but Pribish is confi-
dent the defense will contain the
Middies.

“It’s hard to tell what effect
the injuries will have. but if
everybody pulls through." he
concluded. “I think we can do the

needs them. I expect that they'll
have the largest pep rally, be-
sides the Army ‘one, for the team on
Friday night.”

What effect the corps will have
upon his own team. Hart isn‘t
quite sure. “All I can go on is

.what effect it had on us against

Army two years ago." he sta-
ted. In that game Army came from
behind and defeated Pitt. before
the Cadets.

Before Hart even gets to Ann-
apolis. he must‘ make sure that he
has enough healthy__ bodies to
field. two full squads. “We'll be
taking 46 men with us. instead of
the usual 44 man traveling squad.”
the coach said. “Many of 4' the
boys we will be taking will be in
questionable shape for 'the
game. No one can tell just how
long these boys ‘will be able to
stand up physically." '

Some of these walking wound-
ed are backs Denny Ferris, Joe
McCain and Gary Cramer. Mc-
Cain is the most «doubtful with

ing to due because of injuries to
his defensive platoon. Line-
backers Eddie Galin (shoulder

Middies Reflect Panther Problems

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The Panthers might think
they are looking in a mirror
when they face Navy in Ann-
apolis Saturday.

Both teams have offenses that
are capable of moving the ball.
but defenses that don‘t give the
offense much of a chance. Both
teams are in aperiod of re-
building. 6

Despite the loss‘._of the A1l—East
pass-catch combination of quar-
terback John Cartwright and split-
end Rob Taylor. Navy has display-
ed the ability to penetrate oppos-
ing defenses. A

Sophomore Mike McNallen is
the new quarterback for coach
Bill Elias’s Midshipmen. As a
Plebe last year, McNallen passed
for an even 1,000. yards in leading
the Navy frosh to a 6-1 season.
Thus far this year, McNallen
has not been far off that pace..

The. sophomore quarterback
has a number of fine receivers to
pass to. Captain Mike Clark is
the primary receiver. Last year.
Clark pulled down 31 passes.
But with Rob Taylor graduated.
the senior tight end is thrown to
even more and is averaging al-
most 5 catches per game.

McNallen has also thrown to his
halfbacks regularly‘ this fall.
Sophomore flanker Karl Schwelm
and senior halfback Roland Lau-
renzo have displayed the ability
to receive. as well as run.

But .\'avy's ability to move the
ball across the goal-line has been
hampered by sophomore mistakes.
particularly ;\Ic.\'allen‘s ten in-
tercepted tosses and four lost

However. Navy’s failure to win
in four games this season is due

- to a thus far inadequate. inexper-

ience defense. The Midshipmen
have not been able to hold any
of their opponents to under 26
points

Gone from last year‘s defensive

backs Rick Bayer and Gerry Motl.
Their graduations have complica-

.-ted a Midshipmen project of re-

building a unit that surrendered
205 points last fall.

The line is experience and strong
in the middle with tackles Tom
Cleverdon (6-3, 213) and Tom
McKeon (64,225) and All-East

candidate Emerson Carr at middle
guard, but inexperienced at the
ends, with Sophomore Thomas

O’Brien (6-3, 200) and convert-
ed quarterback Mike Lettieri
(6-1,197). '

The rest of the Academy's ‘de-
fensive unit is comprised mostly
of sophomores and returning let-
termen who haven’t played con-
sistently in the past.

Defensive back Jom Sheppard is
the only Navy reliable defending
the passes of enemy «quarterbacks.

Despite all the inconsistencies
in the Navy lineup, the Middies
are nine-point favorites against
the Panthers. There are a few
points to consider that can ex-
plain Navy (0-4) being favored.

.\’av_y is home and the Panthers
are plagued with injuries. Also.
Navy showed marked improve-
ment in a 26-20 loss to Air Force.

 

  Harriers Battle W V U; I

Hatfield Faces Richey
In Clash For Top Spot

by BILL NAAB

West Virginia’s distancemen have won seven of their first
eight meets. Coach Jim Banner’s harriers, tomorrow, will in-
vade the hilly Mountaineer course, in what Banner describes as

“a pretty tough meet.”

Last week, Penn State just barely edged past the Mountaineers, and
coach Banner hopes that his boys can also down the West Virginians.
In preparation for the important meet, Banner has slightly increased
the tempo of practice. He stated that he’s had difficulty gathering all

the boys together for the past few days. Otherwise, his practices have

been coming along fine.

In addition, Mark Vornhagen
will again be running. Last week
Vornhagen, apparently, had a
heavy cold and was worn down.
Nonetheless, he is looking for-
ward to tomorrow’s meet. Also,
sophomore Mike Nolan is anxious
for the upcomming. encounter.
Banner stated. “I’m real pleas-
ed with Mike. He’s running bet-
ter than at anytime this year.”

Greg Rodgers and Ken Lawton,
however, are still question marks.
Rodgers has started running again,
and we hope he’ll be ready. But,
I’m still not sure if we’re going to
use Lawton,” said Banner.

According to reports, the West
Virginians are excited about the
Richey-Hatfield confrontation.
Both Jerry Richey and west
Virginia’s Carl Hatfield are re-
cognized as first class runners.

The race should provide a trem- '
' endous head to head clash between

the two tri-state area stars.

“Hatfield will push Richey.
He’s one of the best runners in
the East. He also came in first

Saturday. against Penn State,”

commented Banner.

West Virginia coach Stan Ro-
manoski remarked, “Hatfield
has been fantastic. He not only
is a natural runner, but. he has
a great deal of savy, too. He is
definite all-American material.”

Romanoski continued to com-
ment that he believes that his sen-
ior star seems to have a sixth
sense about running. in addition
to being a hard worker. He added,
“He’11 make a good showing out
there for us this Saturday, I’1l as-
sure you.” .

In West Virginia’s loss to Penn
State, Hatfield triumphed against
another top-flight runner. Steve
Gentry. Moreover, in capturing

top honors this season, Hatfield,

like Richey, has been smashing

   
   

KEN LAWTON
l)(mbtfuI for WVU

one course record after another.
Yet, he shifts much of the credit
for the Mountaineer’s success
to his teammates.

“I don’t know why 'I’m always
rated number one on the team,”
he says. “We have seven other
guys, anyone of whom could be
first.”

Actually, though, none of this
West Virginia optimism scares
coach Benner and his squad, Jer-
ry Richey in particular. Richey
performed well, competing
against the nation’s top. athletes
at the Olympic trials and has
gained added confidence. Jerry
has also won every crosscountry
meet that he has run this season.
According to his coach, the cross
country run is his forte, and in
nearly every meet thus far, Richey
has crashed the previous course
_record.

Banner remarked that he doesn’t
think about records. “Records are
just bonuses," he asserts. “I’m
worrying about being number

Yogis Near Mid—Season

May Drown ‘Bubba’

Wet Picks

by WILLIE BAXT

It’s mid-season for the palsy
prognosticators and none of
the Yogis seem to be feeling
the pressures, except Art
“Bubba” Rosengarten.

“That’s the first time I ever

» made the picks from the ‘bottom

of Trees Pool," moaned “Bubba".
“But that was also the last time."

The bloated wonder looked
like Moby Dick’s grandmother
under water. The only difference
seemed to be the fact that when
Bubba surfaced he acted a little
more senile. .

“Now what did I do?” asked
“Bubba.” “I think California
is going to beat those younguns
from UCLA. I heard runors that
Mickey Cureton was offered
three lollipops and a Mickey
Mouse watch to miss Saturday’s
game.”

“Bubba‘s” oxygen tank ran out
before he got half-way down the
spot sheet. so the first-place Yogi
spent most of yesterday after-
noon catching his breath.

“It’s a good thing you brush-
ed your teeth.” said George
“Moustachio” Lies at pool-side.

f‘NoW 3.11 youhavé to do is stép

  

breathing so hard so that I can
concentrate on my picks.”

When “Moustachio” was done,
the selections showed that the
number two Yogi picked just two
games differently from “Bubba.”

“If UCLA and Michigan win,"
said “Moustachio,” “I’ll be tied /
for first place."

Of course, the bloated wonder
and the braggadoccio (“Mous-
tachio”) may both be jeopardizing
first place. Roy “Jumpshot"
Jacobs differed with “Bubba” on

Soccer Team

by ED CONLEY

Leo Bemis will lead his kickers into Forbes Field, tomor-
row, for their first game in the home of the Pirates. Like the
baseballers. the soccermen will be -trying something new. Game

time is 1:30 p.m.

The opposition is Ohie University. and Bemis knows that his
squad can t win if they play like they have been lately. ’

The new play‘? It’s very simple.
The coach will move an extra
man up to the forward line in an
effort to produce a scoring -at-
tack. “We’re going to have to
score more than one goal if we
want to win,” he stated. \

The key men involved in the
switch will probably be Dave Di-
Emido and Lou Vida. The two
hooters, who have been playing at
halfback, would be moved up to
the line, DeEmido at left wing
and Vida in the center.

The remaining linemen will be
as usual, Conference Lekoma
and Bob Trexler in the middle,
and Ron Bugaj at right wing.
Ian Baguley, who has been on
the left wing, injured his leg,
Tuesday. and will see very little
action, if any.

In another switch, Bruce Sear-
foss will move up from fullback
to halfback, forming the 5-2-3
strategy.

Bemis isn’t sure that the booters’
defense can hold up as well as it
has with four fulbacks. He remark-
ed, “We’re going to find out if
it can. I think it can.”

The Bobcats from Ohio shouldn’t
give that defense any breaks,
either. They boast a 2-1 record.
and have shown that they know
how to score. Toledo fell to the
Cats, 4-1, and Miami went down
to them, 2-1.

They can be stopped, too. Kent
State did this, blanking the Bob-
cats, 2-0.

The Booters from Ohio are a
sophomore-oriented group. Only
three players in the line-up saw
action last fall against Bemis’
team. '

Stu Hurry is one of them. He
played left halfback. then. Now,

It looked quite suspicious when
“Bubba” stopped boasting after

he’s the goalie, and a good one, if
his 1.3 goals per game average
means anything.

The other two returnees are
Ihor Miskewicz, at left-half,
and Jim Goodman, on the line.

Bemis is particularly concern-
ed with Miskewicz. The coach
said, “He scares you when he
throws the ball; he throws it so
far.” But, the Bobcat halfback is
not Bemis’ foremost problem. It’s
his own team.

The booters have won only one
of five outings so far. and they are
definitely down. Whether they

, can come back remains to be seen.

Bemis thinks they ‘can. He men-
tioned, “We just have to pull out
of it. When you’re at the bottom all
you can do is come up.”

Bemis also thinks that being
down at this stage isn’t too harm-
ful. He commented, “As long as
they don’t quit trying, they’re
bound to improve. When a ball is
down it bounces up. The questions). -
is how high.”

Then, the coach decided, “I
think they are getting better —
I mean that.”

This is probably true. The mis-
takes seem to be coming less of-
ten. It is a young team, and the
players are just becoming familiar
with each other. But, the wins
aren’t coming.

The coach offered an explana-
tion: “The game is played by a
bunch of men doing something
that is pretty difficult. It boils
down to the fundamentals, along
with hustle.”

_ The coach feels that funda-
mentals like passing and ball
handling must improve on his
team. He thinks they will, too

Booters Lose.
Fourth Game

At Grove Cit

For thefirst time this fall théit
soccer team came from behing-7,:
Tuesday. The only problem is".
that they couldn’t do itgtwice,
and Coach Leo Bemis’ squad went;
down to Grove City, 2-1. ‘ 

_ The Grovers started the scor-,”'
ing off midway through the first‘
quarter, as Chuck Holmes hit the
mark from about five yards in,
front of the nets. ‘ - "

The booters, then, came up with
that come-back effort. Bob Trex-_
ler and Conference Lekoma team-V
ed up for the goal at 16:24’ of,
the opening period, Lekoma knock,’-5
ing the ball in. . i 

That’s the way it stood at half-‘
time. Quickly, in the third .peie
iod (at 3:12) the Grovers went.
ahead to stay, however. Jim Camp‘
was the perpetrator, lining a shot
that bounded off booter goalie-
Len Harmon, and went in. the
nets. __, 

All Bemis could say ‘after’
the hard defeat was something;
that an old friend of his had told-V
him immediately after the loss:
“Some consolation is that ten
years from now you won’t remem-‘A,
her this one.” __  .

Giving the game a ‘bit more-.
thought, the coach complained,..
“We should have scored more. In?-
fact, both teams should have scor-‘V
ed more. P 0 -

“I think, the fellows could have‘
followed up the plays a little;
better,” he reasoned. is 9

Maybe Bemis won’t remember;
this loss ten years from now. He
will remember it when the squad...
takes the field next time, though.

Basketball head coach Char-
les “Buzz” Ridl’s first week of
the Season has been a busy one.

sters started preparing for a tough
1968-69 season in which they will

avich-led LSU. St. Johns. Du-
quesne. Miami. Syracuse. and
West Virginia.

Ridlhasbeen
teaching his

players warm-
up drills and
fundamental
plays.

“Take your
time and learn
them,” de-
manded Ridl.
at Tuesday’s
practice. “Don’t
worry if you make mistakes now.
If you make mistakes in a few
days, then we’ll worry.”

Ridl and his Panther squad will
display a week's teachings to-
morrow at the University's Bas-
detball Coaches Clinic at the
Field House. The program. which
will run from 8:00 through 4:30

sity’s basketball coaching staff

The program will be highlight-
ed by the Panther team in a
practice session. Buzz Ridl will
show how a team maneuvers for
the high percentage shot using
a deliberate offense.

Ridl is a firm believer in a
planned, deliberate offense. As
a small college coach at West-
minster, Ridl’s squads were 216-
91 xa winning percentage of .704).

Now the one-time NIA Coach-of
the-Year will test his strategy
here. .

“It’s like starting all over again "
said Ridl, “but I’m looking for-
ward t_o the challenge."

This year’s Panther schedule is
treacherous, but Ridl offers the
University’s students hopes for
a winning season.

“We don’t have many "big.
strong boys, and we have no big
man." warned Ridl, “but there are
ways of overcoming that.”

Ridl is determined and he hopes
his players will be too. “Attitude
-is a requirement.” said Ridl.
