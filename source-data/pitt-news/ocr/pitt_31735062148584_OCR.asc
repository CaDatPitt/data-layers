Police Enforce 1
Parking Limit

Near Cathedral

Students Complain
About Inconvenience
Of New Regulations

In a move which will force stu-
dent automobile parkers into even
more congested areas, the depart-
ment of police announced that be-
ginning tomorrow the two hour
parking limit will be rigidly en-
forced on Fifth avenue and on Lyt-
ton avenue between‘Fifth and Bay-
ard. _ . , i _
This action was forced on the po-
lice by complaints of Oakland prop-
erty owners who said that the un-
restricted parking was blocking the
entrances of their homes, declared
Inspector C. J. Dye, 01' the depart-
ment of trafﬁc planning.

There is no "action at present in
the University to counteract the ac-
tion of the police, said Theodore
Biddle, assistant dean of men.

Last year, he added, the Student-
Faculty Association parking and
traffic committtee did all that was
possible to alleviate bad conditions.
This committee was dissolved after
its work had been completed last
year and it has not been established
again this year. -

The committee had succeeded in
getting the streets lined, in getting
parking concessions, and in getting
two safety islands established.

With the police regulations car-
ried out, there will yetvbe. enough
space to park, but most students
agreed, the distance from the Uni-
versity which the cars would have
to be parked would eliminate the
usefulness of an automobile in get-
ting to school." ,

There will be nothing more done,
ofﬁcials stated, until the conditions

of parking are seen under the new
enforcement.

Pavain Describes
Aerodynamics

Henry C. Pavain, professor of
oeronautical engineering, recently
authored a book entitled “Experi-
mental Aeerodynamics,” in which
he describes the results of tests
made in wind tunnels on aeroplane
parts.

Already adopted by several en-
gineering schools as a textbook for
their course in aerodynamics, the
book contains several interesting
discussions of aeronautical testing
equipment development in the Uni-
versity’s engineering laboratories.

The Owl photographer was the

Health Service
Offers Free

Wassermans

Entering its first phase of its an-
nual drive against syphilis and tu-
berculosis, the Men’s Student Health
Service today offered free Wasser-
man tests.

Continuing through the week, and
until next Wednesday, the tests will
be administered free to all male
University students desiring them,
according to Dr. H. C. Carlson, di-
rector of the Health Service.

Immediately following the Was-
serman tests, free tuberculin tests
will be offered from April 8 until
April 17, inclusive. Both sets of
tests will be given in the offices of
the Student Health Service, located
in Falk Clinic.

Students are urged by faculty
heads as well as those connected
with the health service to avail
themselves of the opportunity of
taking the test.

There are abstolutely no “after
effects” of the tests, explains Dr.
Carlson, and the pain is negligible.
The process, which involves simply
the extraction of 3 or 4 cc’s of the
patients blood, takes only about two
minutes. It is after the blood is ex-
tracted that the time-taking analy-
sis is made.

All information disclosed by the
Wasserman tests will be kept
strictly in conﬁdence, and no names,
figures, or percentage ratios will be
divulged.

E1lito1°’s Holiday

By Alvin Malakoif

We sometimes wonder about the higher plane and
Leonardo and Michelangelo. Are they really what we
want the University to produce?

We don’t do this out of any sense of depreciating
the higher plane and Leonardo and Michelangelo. It’s
just that we look around us and despair that such things
should ever come about here. All the engineers seem
intent upon being good engineers, all the doctors seem
to be intent upon being good doctors, all the bus-aders
seem to be interested in being the best business man.

Few students seem interested in painting pictures
of sad-faced, mysterious women, or of gigantic biblical
scenes. Fewer still, although 80 per cent of them will
live in this area, are concerned about making Pitts-
burg the cultural capital of America for the next four
hundred years.

And practically nobody seems to be looking around
for a rich prince to keep them; all the students talk
about making their own way.

. No, we have our doubts about the higher plane and
Leonardo and Michelangelo; at least, we don’t think
they’d make ODK or be a political leader of SFA or
even get into Pi Tau Phi were they actually to come
to school. In fact, we have a sneaking suspicion that
even the faculty wouldn’t pay much attention to them.
That is, if they went around trying to be Leonardo’s
and Michelange1o’s and living in the higher plane.

But the fact of the matter is that Leonardo and
Miclielangelo didn’t go around trying to live in an ex-
alted sphere. In fact, they were pretty mundane.
Take Leonardo, he did much more than paint the Mona
Lisa or the Last Supper. His note books are ﬁlled
with projects and ideas that were a mite too radical, a
little_"to.o_'ad‘van‘ced to suit his age. He had notions about
flying -machines, and town" planning, and hydraulic
pumps, and ,a myriad other social political, botanical
and mechanical ideas; but the rich prince didn’t think
that they would make Florence the cultural capital of
Europe for the next four hundred years.

And Michelangelo was no slouch either. He moved
around in all kinds of circles and was a great poet, as
well as a sculptor and painter and architect. We also
have a sneaking suspicion he didn’t have any ob-
jection to wielding a chisel for more mundane stone-
carving such as making a bust of a local rich man.

To put it bluntly, we don’t think that these men
just lived to be artistic appendages to the world of their
time. They were great artists because they lived as
part of their world, and because they thought about it.

We do not think that the University function is to
«create artistic appendages. We think it is right in
teaching the engineers, to . be engineers, and doctors
to be doctors; for in that way it ﬁlls a need in the
world, and more -particularly, in this area.

And so we come to a summing up, a statement of
‘what we do think. We oﬁer it not because we think it
is a plan or that it is the last word, but because we don’t
want to be accused of merely shouting down what is.

We view the‘University‘not as the artistic capital of
the United States for the next few centuries, but as the
cultural and intellectual and educational center of the
‘tri-state area as long as this area needs it. We think
of it as a people’s University; one that trains people for
the mundane things of every day life, and which of-
fers the opportunity for the intellectual and cultural
development of these people without making them lily-
wavers or “art for art’s sake” nuts.

This University should furnish the best trained men
and women to be the doctors, the lawyers, the en-
gineers, the business men, the town planners and ad-
ministrators, the painters, the potters, the teachers and
all the other technicians needed for modern living, to
the town and cities of this region.

That’s what we think this University should pro-
sride.

1Editor, the Pitt News:

./And tell us, dear old amiable, understanding F.S.M.,
is there any truth to the rumor that Einstein, Hitler,
F.D.R., and 14478 at Ossining all put double knots in
their shoelaces?

OSCAR SHEFLER, C41.

Editor, the Pitt News:

In regards to “M” day at Pitt as a quote from Colo-
nel Holcombe in Mr. Palkot’s article. Is it possible that
the Colonel unwittingly made those statements at a
YMCA dinner some two months ago? Is it possible
that he had no intention of being quoted on that which
is merely prophesy? Also my dear Palkot, did you read
the article on student propaganda on page two of the
same issue of the News?

Point 2. Quote: “A more alert student mind .
propaganda must now be more subtle.”

Now let me quote you on page one: “If theree is a
war this year, those who are twenty-one, those belong-
ing to the class of 1940, will be drafted as a unit.” How
interesting, Mr. Palkot, and what very subtle propa-
ganda. This is the ﬁrst time I knew there was a pos-
sibility of war in which the U. S. might become in-
volved in 1940. Let me point out a peculiar psycho-
logical fact. Foist an idea, however repulsive, on the
public for a period of time and it will, regrettably
enough, cease to rebel against it.

As a thorough-going paciﬁst, I beg of you to keep
this in mind when writing such articles.

If the colleges of the United States would present a
united front against war, it is my belief that there
would be no more war, for if the youth of America re-
fused to ﬁght unless attacked, there would be a remark-
able gap where front ranks should be. For you see
the veterans of the last war have developed a peculiar
antipathy to living in ditches.

Think it over my friend, and in the meantime, please
refrain from any casual propaganda.
R. T. GESTRICI-I.

Editor’s note: Let little-novel-that-wasn’t-there
iwriter Gestrich rest assured that Colonel Holcombe
gave both an interview and permission for an article on

’M day by reporter Palkot. Let paciﬁst Gestrich also
understand that -other University paciﬁsts who belong
to Peace Council see no great danger to our peace in the
M day story.

Politics like spring is certainly in the air . . . what
else would cause campus bigwigs such as Pat Cusick,
Joe Roberts, Rae Young and Roy Walters to have their
own private caucus in the Tuck Shop? and later to be

Chestnut Street, and Downtown Drag following close
behind.

Critic Praises ‘The Adding Machine’

Elliott’s Sets, Patrick’s Acting Highlight

By Ford Curtis
ass. prof. of english

In Elmer Rice’s “The Adding
Machine” at Foster Memorial
Thursday and Friday, the Pitt

Players maintained the high stand-
ard set last year in their excellent
production of Wilder’s “Our Town.”
Rice’s play, first produced in 1923,
is one of the landmarks of Expres-
sionism, a dramatic form that
makes use of devices that reveal
what lies beneath the realistic sur-
face. This conventional form makes
heavy demands -on cast, producer,
and designer; demands that were
met admirably last week.

The seven scenes, built by the
technical staff from sketches made
by Philip C. Elliott, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts, combine the sim-
plicity required by rapid changes
with the interpretive quality ,,all

expressionistic scenes must havef

For the scenes are not merely a
backdrop for the action. The ﬁgures
on the wall, the towering book-
keeper’s stools reveal Mr. Zero and
his obsessions and confusions. And
l\/Ir. Elliott’s scenes are set off ﬁt-
tingly by Director Whitehil.l’s stag-
ing and lighting. After an atmo-

sphere of gloom and foreboding
that runs through the first ﬁve
dimly-lighted scenes, we come to
the clear, sunlit air, the iieecy
clouds, the flowers and green grass
of heaven. As the curtain rises the
audience knows that this is the one
scene that offers some hope for Mr.
Zero.

Bill Patrick as Mr. Zero is com-
mendable in an exacting role. On
the stage throughout the entire ac-
tion, and doing heavy duty i.n most
of the scenes, he meets his sever-
est test in the long monologue in
the courtroom. The humor, the
satire, and the pathos of this scene
he interpreted expertly. The other
members of the cast gave him wor-
thy support, with Edna Kaufman
as Mrs. Zero, Betty Brunk as
Daisy Diana Dorothea Devore, Bob
Osterloh as‘ Shrdlu, and Bill lVIcEl-
wain as a celestial cop doing val-
iant service. All are deserving of
more notice than the limits of this
review will permit. George Spelvin,
that wraith of the theatre. appears
appropriately in the graveyard
scene.

The excellence of the production
is a tribute to the thoroughness of

|Kecp Oﬁ" the Grass ByBinMazefsky

I have been tinkering with a plot
for the screen which, if they add
Gable, Lamarr, and Tracy, would
have everything. Even the cliches.

Opening:

The epic unfolds itself in the
American frontier days when our
Ancestors were rolling West in cov-

ered wagons and when the noble
red man was handing out free com-
bination haircuts and scalp mas-
sages. We can skip the build-up.
Cecille B. and millions of extras
will take care of that. (The ad-
vertisement will read: “Cost ﬁve
million to make—but it was worth
it!)

.With Gable . and Tracy loving
Hedy, the‘ colonel’s daughter, we
really got a great climax coming
up. Our Ancestors are dashing
across the plain and suddenly about
nine million of Cecille B’s noble
red men spring out of the bushes.
The wagons hastily circle around.
(If you want India and British
troops, we can do the famed British
Square. As long as, the co1onel’s
daughter is along.) ' '

And the noble red men start go-
ing round and round, shooting our
Ancestors with guns which they
bought from some of our less glori-
ous, munition-selling Ancestors.
Meanwhile Gable and Tracy both
love I-ledy who loves Gable which
makes Tracy very noble about it
all.

Development:

Unexpectedly Gable and our An-
cestors discover that they are shy
of Ammunition, water, and Ammu-
nition. They’re really in a hell of
a ﬁx. Tracy decides to run for
help. Gable decides to run for help.
Hedy decides to run for help. Gable

slugs Hedy, saying it hurts him
more than it does her. Tracy slugs
Gable with similar sentiments.

Meanwhile the noble red men keep
knocking off our Ancestors.
Tracy runs. Six arrows pierce
his back, making Tracy look like
3. chicken. (Yeh, the Indians have
arrows, too. Or else it’s at movie
" boner.) — He gets to the fort. Tells
the Colonel. Dies. Now Gable
. and Lamarr can marry, which is
the only reason [it is necessary to
wipe out Tracy, who is really a.
nice fellow.

So the Colonel and his troops dash
to the scene, blowing bugles and
waving ﬂags. At the scene our An-
cestors are just about out of am-
munition. The noble red‘ men are
closing in. Gable is saving a last
bullet for Hedy. No fate worse
than death for her.

Climax:

But the Colonel and the troop are
ten minutes late. Gable accidental-
ly used the last bullet on a. noble
red man. After erasing all our An-
cestors, the noble red men heard the
Colonel and thetrooptcoming, bu-
gles and all. So they ambushed the
boys in blue and wiped them out
no.

In case Hollywod is worried
about the box office, we are sure
the Essefay Theatre will gladly
show the ﬁlm. Also the ﬁlm will
undoubtedly be very popular on
Indian reservations.

Mr. Whitehill’s work. Only pains-

achieve the unbroken illusion of
this difficult play. Rice’s satire may
be slightly dated now, rather long-

missed in this, one of the best pro-

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

ALMOST ANY COACH will tell you that he prefers a com-
petitor with fair ability to a boy who lacks competitive spirit, no
matter how ﬁne an athlete he may be potentially.

‘What brings the subject to mind is a discussion we heard the
other day about the victory of the Pitt swimming team in the East-
ern Collegiate Swimming association championships at Lancaster,

Pa.

In winning the meet the Panthers were sparked by as st'rong

a competitor as will be found in college ranks,

The gentleman in

question was captain Alex Slobodian, a senior and one of the four
members of th.e Fifth Avenue high school tank squad who trans-
ferred to the Cathedral en m.asse four years ago.

Slobodian A Team Swimmer

Slobodian is not a great swimmer.

Several of his teammates

have more natural ability, and While his times are much better than
average, they are well below the records in most events.
But coach Ben Grady has no more valuable man in his lineup

than “the captain.”

As a team swimmer, Slobodian is just about

all that can be desired. His efforts in the relays left ECSA op-
ponents spluttering in his wake. ‘When Pitt needed the points,

Slobodian went out and got them.

On the turns, he was unbeatable.

The quality which distinguishes such a competitor from other
athletes is a vague, indeﬁnite thing, known for the want of a better

name as “

conﬁned to Slobodian.

guts.” It is not conﬁned to swimming, nor at Pitt‘ is it

Competitors bob up in all sports. Mel Port and Ed Straloski

are competitors.

Al Ferrara and Frank Ohl are competitors.

J03

Kristufek is a competitor, and so are Al Holbrook and Bob Foliart.
Two of the best examples of that all-too-rare breed were found
during the past football season in,Ben Kish and Dick Fullerton.
Both boys gambled with their own well-being rather than stop play-
ing, although both had plenty of cause to quit.
Fullerton, Kish Competitors V _
Fullerton was injured in the Washingtiion game, and in every
game from then until the Fordham encounter he was knocked out
at least once. As an ultimate result, he spent weeks in a New York
hospital, recovering from a head injury that‘ for a time threatened

his life.

Kish also was injured, though not so seriously as “VVhimpy.”
Early in the Carnegie Tech game, he cracked a bone in his leg. ‘No
one knew that the bone was broken until the game ended, and Kish
played over 20 minutes after receiving the injury. During those 20
minutes he didlhis best punting of, the day. i ‘

As in the case of Slobodian and several others, the top com-

petitors are not always the ﬁnest athletes.

But the coaches will

take a chance on them, for they ’ll stick when the other boys won ’t.

You can’t keep them down.

Veterans Dot.
Tennis Roster

Pitt’s varsity tennis squad should
be composed mostly of veterans
«during the 1940 campaign.

Hold—over’s from last year's» out-
ﬁt include captain and number one
man Joe Kristufek, Francis Har-
mouth, Ed Goehring, Bob Burns,
Bob Martin, Charles Hergenroeder,
and Carl Kauifman. Kristufek will
undoubtedly hold down the lead-oﬁ
spot again. ‘

I-larmuth and Goehring moved up
to the numbers two and three po-
sitions after gaining experience last
year, and will be hard to dislodge.

Burns played at both numbers
five and six last spring, but his
prospects this spring are uncertain.
Kauffman, Martin, and Hergenroed-
er were reserve men during 1938
and 1939, but may move up to reg-
ular niches this season. The loss by
graduation of Byron McLaughlin,
Larry Smith, and Adrian Hartman
will be felt.

Several recruits from the fresh-
man team may find places on the
net squad. Likely prospects are
Dave Gaenger, Bob Nickescn,_ Shep
Ungar, and Phil Lynch.

Although the schedule has not
been released as yet, it is known
that an attractive series of matches
is carded for the Panther netmen.
Sc-me o-f the outstanding court crews
in the country will engage Pitt this
spring.

The Blue-and—Gold team is pre-
paring for competition with prac-
tice workouts at Hunt armory.

Varsity Golf Team
Candidates to Hold
Important Meeting

All candidates for the University
of Pittsburgh varsity golf team are
to report to James McIntosh, BA40,
in the athletic oﬁ‘ice tomorrow
afternoon, March 19 at 3 o’clock.

The season for the Pitt putters
will begin sometime in the next few
weeks with the exact date depend-
ing upon the actions of “old man
weather.”

According to McIntosh, the pur-
pose of the meeting is to ﬁll out
eligibility cards and obtain speciﬁc
information concerning golf records.
Other plans also will be discussed at
this time.

Anyone. unable to attend this
meeting should get in touch with

- McIntosh or Robert Botkin, C42, as

soon as, possible.

Cold Weather
Keeps Football
Squad Indoors

Only Four Freshman
‘Strikers’ Miss First
Skull Practice Drills

The attendance of all but four
of the freshman players was the
only important development of
the ﬁrst spring football drill last
Thursday as cold weather kept
the squad indoors running through
skull practice.

Although almost the entire frosli
squad had previously indicated their
intention of staying away from prac-
tice until the demands which they
had made were met by the Univer-

sity, the “strikers” turned out in
nearly full force.

The freshmen had no comment
to make on the reason for their de-
cision to take in practice.

Vardaro, Balma. Leave

Marty Vardaro, Howard Balma,
Mario Martorelli, and Bill Dillon
were the absentees. Vardaro has
left school and Balma is expected to
leave this week. Dillon has been
declared scholastically ineligible, but
Martorelli intends to report in a
few olays.

Ineligibility has also erased the
name of fu_llback Joe Connell from
the spring training varsity roster,
leaving Ernie Bonelli as the only
plunging hold—over in the squad of
about 60.

Sophomore lineman Ralph Fife is
unable to attend the drills because
of the school-work he must make
up. Fife was absent from classes
recently because of his illness and
the death of his father.

Swimmer Joins Team

Fred Noah’sidecision to give up
football furthered the depletion of
the available linemen. Noah is a
sophomore and was reserve guard
on the squad last year.

The swimming team contributed
one of its members to the football
squad when A1 Sampson reported

last Thursday for the spring work- ‘

outs. Track practice prevents the
appearance of “Hap” Stickel among
the candidates, although Stickel has
expressed-a desire to play. A

There have been no deﬁnite dates
set for the beginning of outside

VVAA Cagers
Hope to Break
Duquesne Jinx

Pitt’s WAA basketball team will
atempt to break a long-time Du-
quesne jinx today when the two
teams meet in the Cathedral Gym.

In past meetings of Pitt and Du-
quesne, play has been hard and
close, but the Dukes (or, rather
Duchesses) have usually won.

Past performances offer no com-
parison of the strength of the two
clubs. Little is known of the Du-
quesne team’s ability, and the
teams met by Pitt so far have not
played the Hilltop girls. Experi-
ence may give the Cathedral sextet
a slight edge.

Wednesday Pitt rallied late in the
game to defeat the Tech girls, 26-24.
Up until the ﬁnal few minutes of
play, the Techites had been in the
lead. _

For Pitt Betty Fagan with 10
points and Florence Ragan with
eight were outstanding. Carver was
the high scorer for the losers, tally-
ing four ﬁeld goals.

The win over the Tech team
stretches the WAA win streak to
Previous to the
Tech game, the Pitt outﬁt topped
the YMHA team by a 14-11 count
and the Evangeline Residence six,
28-18.

Starting for the Pitt team, in all
probability, will be Ragan, Anne
Beatty, Annabelle Miller, Klein,
Fagan, and Kate Rutherford. Ragan
repeatedly has placed the “Panther
women” in scoring.

Panther Cagers Honor Billie

Geneva Sharpsliooter Heads Pitt All-Opponent Team

By Phil Lynch

John Billie, ﬂaxen-haired Geneva
dribbler, was the toughest opponent
that the Pitt basketball team faced
this year. Only a sophomore at the
Beaver school, rugged Billie was the
sole performer to pile up an unani-
mous verdict in an all—opponent poll
voted on by members of the team
and Pitt News sports writers.
Three District Boys

Though he played with a medi-

ocre team that lost half of its con-
tests, the Covenanter sharpshooter

could be counted

   
  

tpoints a game to
his team’s score.

Only three dis-
t r i c t ﬁoormen
were placed on
either of the two
teams. In addi-
tion to Billie,
John Barr and
Rudy Baric rep-
E resented l o c a 1

Baric, apparently
the better half of
W e s t Virginia’s
Baric-Ruch “scoring twins,” was the
only other soph to be named on the
first five. The tall Mountaineer’s
shots from under the hoop account-
ed for 17 of his team’s points in the
ﬁrst Pitt—West Virginia game.

Tied with Baric in the voting
were Rae, Michigan stalwart, and
Jim Bennett, outstanding Cornell
forward. Rae was the chief Wol-
verine threat against Pitt when the
Ann Arbor team rornped Off '00‘ 3
win in an overtime. He ranked
high among the leaders in Big Ten
scoring and is a prominent candi-
date for the All-Conference _team.

ﬁiuue

Indiana Places One

Bennett has been the Big Reds’
top man for two years. He ranks
with Dartmouth’s Brobemz as an
All-Eastern conference star. The
Cornell cager sifted through the
Panther defenses to lead the scoring
when Cornell fell before a ﬂashy
Pitt attack.

For the ﬁfth post on the all-op-
ponent quintet, the Indiana Hoosiers
offered their most valuable man,
Armstrong. The lanky star will
long be remembered by local fans
as one of the men who was respon-
sible for the single blot ona great

JIM BENNE'I"I‘«--
Cornell ace

mate Menke was responsible for
the scoring, the dependable Arm-
strong was the player who kept his
team rolling.

Menke, whose one-hand shots
split the rim for 22 points against
the Dukes, was chosen as a second

team member. Against Pitt he
worked as one of ﬁve cogs in the

Indiana team, and though his play
was less outstanding, his ability
still warranted a berth.

Missing the top team by a single
vote was midshipman Ackley of the
Navy. Ackley’s 19 points against
a wavering Panther ﬁve almost
gave a weak Navy team a victory.
Rizzo Second Team

Michigan placed a second man
on the mythical opponent roster,
Sophiak, an exceptional guard who

clung to his man like glue. The
Wolverine ball hawk kept in the
Panthers’ hair all evening when the
Western conference team nosed out

i the Panthers.

Fordham’s Rizzo and Barr from
Penn State were the other two
choices for the team. Before a large
Madison Square Garden audience,
the Golden Panthers put on one of
their greatest shows when Dr. Carl-
son’s boys played ﬂawless ball
against Fordham, but it was Rizzo
who held the Fordham team to-
gether and prevented Pitt from
turning the game into a route as
they had previously against Car-
negie Tech and West Virginia.

Carlson Likes Dukes

Barr has been a standout at Penn
State. His “center man” perform-
anceatin one of the finest zone. de-
fenses in the country could Hﬁrdly
be bettered.

Honorable mentions are: McWil-
liams, Penn State; Stark and Burke,
Tech; Beisler, Waynesburg; Chepko
and Mandich, West Virginia; Hetra,
Westminster.

When asked his opinion of an all-
opponent team, Dr. Carlson had but
one answer.

“Just put down that Duquesne
team for me.”

Four Panther Athletes to Train
For Dance Act in Student Opera

By Julia. Waida.

Although the varsity football and
basketball seasons are over, four
University athletes are still being
coached in foot work, this time for
the sailor dance in “Dido and
Aeneas,” the all-student opera to
be presented on April 9 and 10.

Football players Walter Fridley,
Ed4l; Joseph Rettinger, Ed41; and
Rudy Gradisek, C41, and basketball
player Charles Ptacek, Ed40, will
be seen as a group of robust and
carefree sailors. They are being
trained by Dr. Elizabeth Rearick,
associate professor of physical ed-
ucation, and Miss Gladys Ryland,
instructor in group work.

Miss Ryland, a former student
at the Bennington and Humphreys
school of dances in New York city,
has made her original arrangements
by modernizing the seventeenth
century dance styles to keep in line
with the music composed by Henry
Purcell.

The other two groups are com-

Pi Lams Bow

To Hi-Rocks

Win number four went down in
the books for the Hi-Rocks bowlers
last Friday when they eliminated
the Pi Lams from the all-campus
race. As yet the Rocks have not
suﬁered defeat in a match and in
the Pi Lam engagement they set a
record team score of 628.

Today the Hi-Rocks, led by Vic
Kelly, John Kretz, Eugene Demm-
ler, Mark Anderson, and Pete Pe-
cora, meet the once-defeated Sweep-
ers in the semi-ﬁnals.

The Sweepers pushed aside the
Amity Club on Friday to land the
semi-ﬁnal match. Harry Leonard
sparked his team to victory with a
one—game score of 200, high for the
afternoon. Dick Trimble, D. Body-
combe, and George Lanz ﬁlled out
the remainder of the Sweeper ros-
ter.

In the third match of the day the
Industrial Engineers shoved the
Chem Engineers out of the race.
Elliot of the Industrials rolled a
188 for top honors.

Today’s semi-ﬁnal sends the
Sweepers and the Hi-Rocks together
at 4:30 o’clock on the Strand alleys.
Wednesday the Industrials meet to-
day’s winner on the same alleys at
4:30 o’clock.

Lightning Hits Regularly

Cathedral Occupants Never Feel It.’

By Fred Lange

VVhile thousands of University
students sit quietly in their classes,
lightning may be shivering the
spine of the Cathedral, for it has
been struck more than any other
building in this district, declares
H. E. Dyche, professor and head
of the department of electrical en-
gineering.

A bolt of lightning which attain-
ed the crest magnitude of 21,000
amperes, enough electricity to sup-
ply four and a half Cathedrals at
one time, hit the main University
building.

Three direct contacts have been
observed. The ﬁrst occurred early
last spring, when 16,000 amperes
shot through the Cathedral. A
3,000-volt disturber was shattered
by the stroke. The second “uni-
directional surge” was conﬁrmed on
June 10 and reached 21,000 amper-

 The last recorded hit came
sometime between October 21
and 25.

The familiar pole which extends
from the top of the Cathedral is not
a flag pole but a 50-foot lightning
rod. Three direct hits have been
recorded by equipment connected to
this mast.

AUSTIN, TEXAS-— (ACP) -Re-
porting a proved method for learn-

less than 50 hours’ instruction, C.
V. Pollard, University of Texas
Germanic language instructor liter-
ally has brought one of the most
difﬁcult of languages to translate to
his students’ ﬁnger-tips.

The result of four years’ work,
Pollard"s novel method has passed
92 out of 94 students on language
exams that ordinaril.y require three
years’ schooling, he claimed here
today. Instruction times varied
from 11 to 51 hours, averaging 25.

Oil, Gas Divisions
To Fete Seniors

Encouraged by the success of the

undergraduates of the Oil and Gas
department voted last Thursday to
create a customs committee to ar-
range a farewell dance for the

Headed by Joe Rodgers, M41, the
committee includes: Joe Padolsky,

complicated sentence structure of
the German language, has been
copyrighted. He will publish a
book on it this summer, he said.
Pol.lard’s system requires the
learning of nine verbs and a few
rules in lieu of extensive study of
German grammar texts. In place
of a haze of “do’s and don’ts,”
Pollard has substituted the ﬁnger
movement. The left ﬁnger is used
as a guide and locates the key
words, enabling the right thumb to
move along the sentence, as the
reader follows through. Breaks in
the sentence, made by punctuation

and the fact that all German nouns A

are capitalized, are clues used.

Business Activity

Falls During Week

The index of business in the
Pittsburgh area dropped 2.6 points
during the week ending March 9,
according to the ‘Bureau of Business
Research of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Although the index has fal-
len a little more than 28 points
since the first of December, it is
still 10 points above the early Sep-
tember ﬁgure.

structure of the Cathedral, students
are reasonably safe. The attrac-
tion oflthe building, caused by its
height and structure. forms an
“umbrella-like area” which extends
on all sides of the Cathedral at ap-

proximately the distance from
Forbes street to the University
structure. Anyone in that area

during a lightning storm, claims
Dyche, would be practically “im-
mune” from a powerful electric
shock.

Dr. G. D. McCann Jr., Westing-
house lecturer in electrical engi-
neering, assists at the lightning
station on top of the Cathedral.

The station is one of four units
equipped with a fulchronograph,
a lightning-recording mechanism
constructed by the Westinghouse»
Electric and Manufacturing com-
pany. The device was installed last;
summer.

Final Career

Guide Tuesday

Final Career Guides for freshman
women sponsored by the vocational
guidance committee of WSGA will
be held tomorrow afternoon.

Miss Edith Jamieson, instructor
in textiles, will address the informal
discussion group in 149 Cathedral
at 3:30‘ o’clock on the personal and
professional requirements for suc-
cess in retail training.

At the same time in 202 Cathe-
dral Mr. Frank Shockley, director
of the University Extension’ Divi-
sion, will talk to freshman women
interested in secondary education.

Elizabeth Richards, Ed41, re--I
minds all freshman women that at-
tendance at one of the discussions-
is required and that all women are
invited to attend more than one.

For those girls whose choices
were not included in the career-
guides, personal interviews with
women who are outstanding in that
field have been arranged.
