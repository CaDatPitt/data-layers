Last night, representatives from
Pitt’s administration and ‘Student

listen to students’ concerns about

financial aid and retention as part of

the student leaders--’ forum series.
Students were invited to bring

their concerns to thenine-member

panel that included SGB President

Jeff Alex, Vice Provost and Interim»

Dean of Students Jack Daniel, and
representatives from Pitt’s office of
admissions and -financial aid, the
office of institutional advancement,
student affairs _and student financial
services.

' The forum resulted "in a new
committee being formed as a liaison
to the provost’s office through SGB.

Many of the same issues were
raised repeatedly by‘ different stu-_
dents. . - '
Among these issues were the

‘- desire for a black cultural‘center' on

campus to aid retention of ' black
students, and financial aid for. stu-
dents not supported‘ by their parents
and for students who did not receive
aid as incoming freshman. .» s * V
George Ayub, the"SGB ‘academ-

ic affairs chair,.told the audience ,

that financial aid -and retention are
two topics his committee has been
hard at work on. .
Along with the provost’s office,
the committee is working on. a
financial aid Web site for Pitt stu-
dents to use as a resource in secur-_

~ing educational funding. Ayub said

the site should be finished

by the
end of the semester. ‘

CHRISTINE CLAUS
For The Pitt News

Homophobic rush posters distrib-
uted across campus last month were
recently revealed to be the work of a sin-
gle member of the Delta Tau Delta fra-
ternity. '

According to Delta Tau Delta
President Shawn Bowers, the entire
episode, for which his fraternity apolo-
gized in a ﬁ1l1—page advertisment in the
Feb. 8 edition of The Pitt News, made
the Greek community look like some-
thing it’s not.

“The actions of one person por-
trayed the views of the whole fraternity,
and we, as a whole, do not feel that way
at all,” Bowers said. “Our entire chapter

. condemns what that individual brother
did.” ~

The ﬂiers, which referred to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Pi Kappa Alpha
brothers as “limp-wristed,” labeled the

. fraternityisi members gay and ‘ listed a_
variety of ﬁctional Rush Week activities,
including numerous explicit sexual acts.

 '‘ Bowers_-said Delta Tau Delta took

No charges filed
in alleged Bouquet
Gardens assault  

The police recently concluded its
investigation of a Jan. 29 sexual assault alle-
gation. The investigation sterns ﬁom a com-
plaint by a non—student who called the Pitt
police from an Oakland Avenue emergency
phone. The women reported she was sexu-
ally assaulted by several male acquaintances
in Pitt’s Bouquet Gardens complex.

After the assault, Pitt police Chief Tim
Delaney said that the incident was not the
result of a forced entry. ‘°I'his was not a
stranger walking the streets,” he ‘said atthe
time. Police initially identiﬁed three sus-
pects, but will not be charging anyone with

— rape or sexual assault. -

According to Delaney, ‘The com-

plainantwill not pursue any criminal or judi- '

cial charges.”

“There was no money available

Debbie Rupert, a senior associ-

explained, “A lot of students don’t
think of loans as financial aid, but
that’s our biggest source [of aid].”

“No student should leave the
University for financial reasons
without talking to someone in the
Office of Admissions and Financial
Aid first,” she said repeatedly.

Other questions dealt with the
logistics surrounding financial aid.
One student asked whether a schol-

arship could be used to cover off-,

“I’m impressed that they aren’t tak-

Telep feels that both the Greeks and

Daniel said he was under the
impression that the College of Arts
and Sciences called students who
left the University.

He also pointed out that Pitt’s .

retention rate has gone up over the
past several years.

“Perhaps the administration
hasn’t effectively communicated
enough about what we’ve been
doing to keep people,” he said,
adding that he would make a point
of finding out more about what is

Alex thanked everyone for

copy of an 11-page report from the

“Your complaints will not fall on

Daniel concluded, “Over the

Fraternities must clean up their act

It only takes a little spark to start
a wild, raging fire. As a trite, age-old
axiom, it’s tried and true. Just ask
Smokey the Bear or Delta Tau Delta

President Shawn Bowers. Both of‘

them know from painful experience.

A few weeks ago, an unnamed
member of Delta Tau Delta hung
posters around campus to take a stab
at fellow fraternities Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and Pi Kappa Alpha. The
posters made references to brothers
being involved in homosexual activ-
ity, and they carried a demeaning
tone that was all too clear.

The posters were intended to be
funny, but many students —- particu-
larly those in the Rainbow Alliance
—. weren’t laughing. Suddenly, a
tasteless joke erupted into a campus-
wide controversy that threatened the
integrity of Delta Tau Delta and
Greek organizations as a whole.

Members of the fraternity
responded appropriately, issuing a
public apology and punishing the
responsible brother. But perhaps the
entire fiasco could have been avoid-
ed if the fraternity had stressed a
higher level of accountability.

A person may act alone, but
regardless, the irresponsible actions
of an individual have a tendency to
cast an unfavorable light on any
organization he or she belongs to.

The brother responsible for the

- the

posters may be the only man in the
fraternity with homophobic lean-
ings, but his decision to act on them
had many people wondering if this
might be" a sign of a much bigger
problem. It just goes to show how
important it is for members of any
group to accurately reﬂect the ideals
of the whole.

This may be especially true of
Greek organizations, which are
viewed by many as little more than
shallow drinking clubs. Hollywood
has pitched in over the years to con-
tribute to this image, producing
movies like “Animal House” and
“Revenge of the Nerds” that stress
importance of alcohol and
debauchery.

Many fraternities and sororities
are involved in charity work and
community service, but the virtuous
side of Greek life is usually over-
shadowed by the cynical common
sentiment. And it doesn’t help the
situation when homophobic posters
are plastered around campus in the
name of a recognized fraternity.

Greek. organizations offer value
to the community through their ser-
vice projects, and they provide
freshmen with the opportunity to
meet new people, but they must
work extra hard to keep their mem-
bers accountable if they want to
combat popular stereotypes.

maintenance on taxpayers. ' '

Arguing that some taxpayers cannot
afford for themselves the software that
prisoners enjoy, the county controller
used a 2000 state law to -freeze about
$500,000 of the money currently support-
ing the computer programs. He proposes
to instead funnel the ftmds into regular jail
operating expenses such as maintenance
and utilities. ‘

funding shouldn’t center on cutting costs,
but on rehabilitating criminals and reduc-
ing the number of repeat offenders.

In a county jail, where prisoners are
more likely petty felons than hardened,
violent criminals, the emphasis is placed
on treatment. According to its Web site,

’ Allegheny County Jail’s mission state-
ment promises to “collaborate with other .,
rehabilitative treatment and education 

programs for inmates.”

If we do not provide prisoners with
attractive alternatives to crime, they will
most likely return to the activities that put
them in jail in the first place. Ultimately,
it’s cheaper to educate people the first
time around than to keep them in jail for
multiple sentences.

Practically speaking, it’s more cost-
efficient to fund programs: that will
decrease crime in the long run. . "

The justice system fails without some
form of rehabilitation. But supporters of

Letters to Ken: Former Enron CEO -deregulates love

Dear Kenny-Boy, ‘

My girlfriend and I have been going out for

two years now, and we ’ve even started talk-
ing about marriage. The only

them guilty. Find their vulnerabilities. Bind
their integrity to yours so that they will work
just as hard as you to keep your indiscretions

This is a tough one, L.I.E.S. On one
hand, you should never trust a woman with
secrets. For example, one time my wife acci-
dentally told my mother about a surprise
party we were planning for her.

Another time, Enron vice president
Sherron Watkins testiﬁed before Congress
that she had repeatedly warned top manage-
ment about the impending ﬁnancial disaster
that our criminal actions were hiding from
the world As both cases show, women just
can’t keep secrets.

On the other hand, sometimes the best
strategy is to screw everyone in sight. Make

blew her 017’ and told her that I
was too tired to get together with her: In real-
ity, I went to Zi strip club with a couple of
friends. She must have known I lied because
when I went to her apartment the next day,

she screamed at me and threatened my life.

At that point I made up some excuse about
needing insulin, and I got the hell out of
there. Given that she knows I ’m not diabetic,

did I do the right thing?

Girlﬁiend Upset I Lied Twice

Of course you did the right thing.
Getting out of that apartment before she

started asking questions was the only right
thing you could have done. I’m mean, you
could have pleaded the Fifth, but that would
have made your guilt all the more obvious.

The important thing now is to convince
her that you are also a victim in this situation.
Perhaps you could have a loved—one appear
on television and weep about how you were
denied a perfectly good meal because of an
unexpected turn of events.

V As it did with my wife’s tearful televi-
sion appearance, this ploy can change the
perception that you are a monster into one
that you are somewhat more human.
Sometimes, G.U.I.L.T., that is the best that
someone like you or I can hope for.

Dear Kenny-Boy,

As the fomier CEO ofEnron, you have come
to represent all the creative accounting, clan-
destine partnerships, mismanaged business-
es and outright lies that are the company’s

legacy. Your skill as a campaign ﬁnancier

put many politicians, both Republican and
Democrat, into your back pocket, and even
Wall Street believed the emperor was ﬁilly
clothed You paid millions to high-ranking
executives for their loyalty and silence, while
at the same time forcing thousands of Enron
employees to hold onto company stock that

would soon be worthless. With all this in
mind I have two questions for you. How do
you live with yourself and how do I convince
my girlﬁiend to have a three-way with rrie
and her roommate .7

Can Roommate Inspire Menage-a-trois
Excitement

To address the ﬁrst part of your letter, I
suppose I am an example of the beauty of
capitalism. VV1th myself at the helm, Enron
came and went, from meteoric rise to cata-
strophic fall. Lives ruined. Accounting ﬁrms
disgraced. Politicians implicated. And
despite all this, I am still a millionaire. What
a beautiful system, -

Firms will come and go. Politicians will
be bought and sold. But the lies, guilt and
crime that made both Enron and myself are
constant and eternal. Or, at least they will be
until the end of the Bush administration.

As for your questions on the menage—a—

The ramiﬁcations of this thing are huge.
Aside from the obvious dreadfulness, there

Ray doesn’t live on the grounds. If he

Since there’s a lake involved, the water

called the EPA in the ﬁrst place was just on
the grounds, so there are bodies all over the
place, probably seeping disease into the
wells of surrounding citizens.

Three area crematoriurns have gra-
ciously offered to cremate all the bodies for

too. It can’t be good for business to share a

You have to question the reasons why
any of this happened. Why didn’t the EPA
check this out last year when they ﬁrst heard
about it? That may have stopped this horror

15 months ago. Tri-State was operating with ’

a valid license. How hard can it be to get one
of those things? It’s hard to even compre-
hend the logic of Ray Brent Marsh, let alone
try to rationalize it.
Death is serious business and the major-
ity of people who work in the industry treat
it as such. It’s a shame the actions of one

Brothers really jam
Iggy "

Tomorrow night
Zythos

South Side
(412) 481-2234

ERIN CAPRANICA
The Pitt News

They play like the Eagles and

sound like Sublime, but their lyrics and
' voices are strictly their own.

In 1996 in Warren, Pa., a group of
three brothers, Mark, a Pitt graduate,
Kevin, a Pitt graduate, and Jason. A
Ignatius, a graduate of the University of
Cincinnati, and their close friend Evan
Young, also a Pitt student, came togeth-
er in an attempt to form, according to

their Web site, “a venerable musical
entity with bonds thicker than the blood
they share.” Their creation: Iggy, a

band playing a combination of funk, '

rock, blues and jazz. Six years and one
more guitarist later, Ryan
Devine, formerly of the band
Jhinx and a student at the
Community College of
Allegheny «County, Iggy man-
aged to penetrate well into New York,

West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio and.

Maryland.

According to Jason Ignatius, gui-
tarist and eldest brother, “Iggy is kinet-
ic, the unconscious spindling and mix-

Play

ing of notes into an effervescent play-
ground. A true and simple blend of

‘energy into one conscious being. It’s

the world around us. It’s the people
within us. It’s everything.”

In November 2000,
Iggy released their debut
album Shell, which features
a blend of tunes from coun-
try to groove to reggae.
Everyone from Ben Folds and Jimmy
Page to Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix
has inﬂuenced the band members.
Artists such as Paul Simon, the Grateful
Dead and Led Zeppelin also have
inspired their writing. —

Iggy plays the type ‘of music that
you can just close your eyes and lose
yourself in. They will be playing
tomorrow night at Zythos on the South
Side and their audience is in for a truly

unique experience. On stage the mem-

bers of Iggy are very instrumental,
which feels just like a jam session with
friends. '
With Kevin Ignatius performing
drum solos and Young, who also serves
as the band’s manager, tinkling on the
keyboard, it can become difficult to
focus on anything other than the vibrant
sounds. The five members share vocal
responsibilities and the voices transi-

tioning from one into the otherduring
their songs helps keep the music alive.

Mark Ignatius, bass player and pri— '

maiy composer, manages to draw the

most onstage attention through his ’

refreshing sarcasm, which he uses to

A motivate the crowd to get up and dance. _

Seeing this band live is seeing five
guys whose music flows through them
like the blood that keeps them alive. By

..watching their facial expressions it‘

becomes obvious that they shut them-
selves off from the rest» of the world

during their performances. It is refresh- '

ing to witness such an inspirational
band.

IWC body slams Laga

The Sandman vsl Boomer Payne r
International Wrestling Cartel

Tonight, 8 p.m.

KENNETH PAUL
Contributing Editor

Long before Stone Cold Steve Austin was
spilling beers all over himself in the World Wrestling
Federation, the Sandman was actually chugging and
busting his forehead open with them in Extreme
Championship Wrestling.

The former hardcore icon, who was an ECW
heavyweight champion and tag team champion, is
heading to Club Laga tonight as part of a solid
International Wrestling Cartel lineup.

The Sandman will take on Boomer Payne in. a
hardcore street fight in tonight’s IW C main event, but
the card features some other notable tal-

Wrestling, has ‘promoted events with. several super-
stars such as Mick Foley, Raven, Stevie Richards and
the Blue Meanie. '

. There will be several local ‘talents on the card-

including Super Hentai and Shirley Doe, who. will
tangle up in a Falls Count Anywhere High‘ Stakes
match. Also Wrestling is Jimmy

ents too. Another former ECW champi— ~ _ AVegas, who is fresh from a tryout
on, Steve Corino, will be in attendance r e 5 f e with the WWF that Connors said

and he will face off against Orion for
the,IWC title. ,

Corinomade his name in ECW waging a bloody
feud with Dusty Rhodes. Sandman is no stranger to
the crimson mask either as he has been involved in
several kinds of hardcore matches, ranging from
barbed wire matches to tacks and ﬂaming tables
matches.

Promoter Norm Connors, a Pitt graduate, is
putting on the show along with co-promoter Bubba
Bulldog from B-94 FM for the IWC, which has been
in operation for more than a year.

Connors, the former owner of Steel City

went very well. _

, “People compare [IWC] to

the 1994-95 ECW days,” Connors said.

It was during the 1994-95 ECW days that
wrestlers such as Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko and
the Sandman were putting on some of the greatest
and most diverse wrestling shows of any time period.

The shows were known for a strong balance of sound ‘

technical wrestling mixed with some of the most
hardcore assaults ever to be seen in the ring. I
The show gets underway at 8 p.m. All tickets are

$10 and can be purchased at any Ticketmaster outlet

or at the Club Laga box office 682-2050.

I’d probably be the first to say I
like classic rock. Channel 97 is usually
playing on the radio where I work, and
I own enough Steppenwolf; Allman
Brothers, and early Pink Floyd albums
to play continuously for a week. "If
there’s music I like more, it would be
soul.

So when I first played Gov’t
Mule’s most recent release The Deep
End, I liked its mellow rhythm and
deep bass sound. But it doesn’t have
the same sound as classic rock. The
album’s good, but the Mule just can_’t
kick. _

For one thing, it’s issued on ATO

Records, founded by Dave Matthews. 1,

don’t know about you, but “ATO” on

Hot Chili Peppers, Stefan Lessard from
Dave Matthews -B and and Bootsy
Collins from P-Funk contributed to the
project. But the instrumentals weren’t
quite up to the standards“ that you
would expect. The tunes are okay, but
the sound is a little jumbled. All these
special appearancesmay have mixed it
up a bit. . ~

Although enjoyable, you can’t help
but feel the tribute could have been bet-
ter. All of its merits would probably be
easier to get by getting an album out of
one of the special appearances.

If you think you would like it any-
way, check out Gov’t Mule at M
tonight.

Something in the way
they move  

Moving Images
Wood Street Galleries
Through March 16 ‘
(412) 471 -6070

Ifthe idea of standing alone in a dark-
ened gallery and slowly watching a por-
trait turn its head and blink or smile at you
is unnerving picture an entire gallery of
images turning and staring.

The current exhibit at the Wood Street
Galleries Downtown, “Moving Images,”
consists of eight installations by six artists.
Each of these pieces is a sort of portrait
portrait, but these are not the pristine por-
traits of the 17th century orthe vivid yet
literally static portraits by Van Gogh.
Instead, each of these installations uses
technology to advance the art of portrai-
ture by animating inanimate images.

For example, Bill V1ola’s
“Memoriam,” is the ﬁrst piece visitors
encounter. A blackened room provides the
canvas for a television playing a DVD
projection of a man’s face. His features
aren’t clear, the image is in black and
white, and static obscures his face. The
grainy black and white image undulates
over the screen, and the face slowly and
continually disappears and returns.

The piece is called “Memoriam,” but
it’s not until after viewers peel their eyes
away from the television set that they
understand the title. The image remains
burned in the back of the retinas, and
requires a few moments in the light for it

to completely disappear. V1ola’s work also
suggests the idea of mankind disappearing
and reappearing. Individuals may disap-
pear, but never forever. The work also
raises questions on the idea of existence
and suggests that perhaps we can only
truly understand it when we’re either not
questioning it or when we’re gone.

Another outstanding and fascinating‘

piece in the exhibit is a technologically
advanced - trompe l’oeil.' Gregory
Barsamian’s “Scream” also occupies a a
square, black room. A strobe light directs
attention to a metal base with about 20
spokes protruding from it. At_the end of
each spoke is a sculpture of a man’sgray
head. The sculpture rotates rapidly, and it
looks as though each of the heads is
screaming so earnestly their lips part and
swallow the heads whole.

This piece is so remarkable because
it’s not quite clear how the trick is hap-
pening. After viewers become inundated
with the advanced technology of the other
pieces in the exhibit, they may wonder if
the 3-D sculpture in front of them is just
another image; something that can be
erased by standing in front of the projec-
tor.

The answer is slightly simpler. The
docent on duty explained that the artist
indeed created 20 different heads — but
that’s the key — they’re diﬁerent heads.
Like claymation, each head has a different
stage in the animation. The base rotates 13
times per second and the strobe lights
assist in creating the rest of the illusion;
each head looks like it’s animated.

On the second level of the exhibit,
ﬁve more pieces occupy space. Again,
they all embrace technology. A.K. Dolven
has submitted two DVD recordings

accompanied by music. One, “Puberty,”
features a nude girl sitting on the edge of a
bed, her hands crossed on her lap, her
scraggly red hair covering her eyes. ‘She
wears a pair .of giant headphones and the
viewers hear the same electronic techno
beats that she does. Across the room,
Dolven’s other piece, “Portrait VV1th a
Cigarette,” features a schoolgirl-like char-
acter in a black cardigan holding a smol-
dering cigarette. She sporadically and
erratically ﬂips a remote toward the view-
er to change the music. As the cigarette
butt slowly grows into a dangling ashen
worm, she ﬂips between opera, techno,
dance and pop music.

The music in “Puberty” and “Portrait”
is essential to the pieces, but four of -the
ﬁve pieces on the second level incorporate
sound; the sounds from the individual
pieces overlap and mesh, creating disso-
nance. It’s unclear whether the gallery has
done this on purpose, but it creates conﬂict
for the viewer, and in some cases, detracts
from the impact of the art.

The only piece the persistent sound
can’t detract from is the mounted frame of
“Reﬂection,” by Bruce Carmon.
“Reﬂection” is more of an invention than
art: The idea behind it is that people can
take a picture of themselves every day
using the camera mounted in the carved

gilt frame. Over a period of time, they will’

develop a record of themselves.

’With the invention of picture frames
that can hold digital photographs in their
memory, Carmon’s idea isn’t too far off
from becoming a convention. VV1th that in
mind, it’s only a matter of time before the
idea of a portrait turning and returning
your smile isn’t too far-fetched either.

Scoping it all out

Kaleidosoape
Watercolors Gallery
Through March 16
901-A Penn Ave.
(412) 201-4003

Soft, delicate begonias, hydrangeas,
roses, daffodils, crocuses and pansies
cover the walls with an inescapable feel-
ing of warmth and rebirth — a harsh con-
trast from the bitter cold wind whipping
down the streets outside. These lively
spring paintings are woven among more
abstract explosions of color and more
controlled landscapes.

“Kaleidosoape” is the combined"

effort of the painters" belonging to
Downtown’s Watercolors Gallery. Variety
of subject matter and style is the inevitable

result of pulling together the work of

many different artists. The gallery said the
works “exemplify passion, air and light
without the need for realism.”

What is clear is that through their

V striking differences, these artists and their

works have managed‘ to put together" a
show that has something for everyone.
“Triple” is a series of three small

paintings by Luise Davis. The paintings»

lack any realism, but the colors ‘create

‘ strong contrasts. Davis worked as an envi-

ronmental scientist but uses watercolors
now because she enjoys the process; She
likes to see the colors run together, “while
many artists seek even greater control,”
' said Davis, “I prefer to relinquish it.”

Gallery artist Susan Pollins displays a
provocative and abstract reaction to the
terrorist attacks with a work entitled,
“91 101 
instead depending upon what she calls her
“artistic vocabulary” to interpret the work
around her. Another artist who takes a
more abstract approach to her work goes

by the name “Bush.” She has been paint- »

ing since 1956 in a style she" calls “abstract
naturalism.” It is a style she describes as
“experimental, exploratory and challeng-
mg.” _ ,

Some of the paintings in
“Kaleidosoape” speak to our youth, like
Patrick Verriano’s piece “Roots.” This
painting brings to life the intricate weav-
ings of an old tree’s root system. It is the
kind of tree you could imagine young

children climbing upon and exploring its ‘

secrets. Other telling works include a
series of Asian landscapes by Louisa Yee
and Eileen
“Execution in Afghanistan.”

The Watercolors Gallery also caters
to art enthusiasts as broke . as starving
artists. In addition to all of the remarkable
paintings in Kaleidosoape, the gallery
sells small original works for a mere‘ $20-
$35. The gallery also sells artistic post-
cards and greeting cards, a beautiful way

. to keep in touch with friends and family.

Keeping my religion

The Process of Belief
Bad Religion. ‘

Epﬂaph
iii‘:

They’ve done it again. Greg Grafﬁn
is fast and Brett Gurewitz is hard — or
maybe it’s the" other way around..Either
way, Bad Religion’s latest, The Process
of Belief, is fantastic.

With this album, Bad Religion
revisits adolescence and rebellion; its
mood is somber, even nostalgic. Grafﬁn
and Gurewitz aren’t writing lyrics for
pre—teens to understand, rather they’re
speaking to an audience that-has grown
up listening to what they have to say —
an audience _who felt compelled to act
by the socially conscious lyrics previ-
ously delivered on Stranger Than
Fiction and Recipe for Hate.

“Supersonic” begins The Process of
Beliefs journey to truth or society’s lack

_ of truth. It’s a new millennium and reli-

gious groups are on the prowl for

' recruits. Walking down a city street, ﬁve

different ‘evangelists pass by. The first
song contemplates, “the c_ondition’s
chronic. . .tell me, does life exist beyond
it? When I need to sate, I just accelerate
into oblivion.” Some feel comforted by
beliefs. What about those who don’t?
Throughout the album, Bad
Religion sends impulses to minds both"
young and old. The songs blend into a
classic punk mix. This time around, the
guys slide through doors of embitter-

 

'ment, peace and as always, uncertainty

more quickly than previous albums.
Pay extra attention to “Sorrow” and

“Evangeline.” The songs are succinct in

‘ their points and stirring in their mean-

ing.‘The album is comparable to Social
Distortion’s self—titled album or Patti

Srnith’s Horses. Every song matters and ~

the album in its entirety is an experi-
ence. = _

The Process of Belief will go down
in punk rock and music history as a clas-
sic. Unfortunately, Bad Religion has not
booked a show in ‘Pittsburgh for this
tour; ‘

Sorry if you didn’t catch them the
last time around, but you can see them
in Washington D.C., -Philadelphia, or
New York City. .If none. of this will
work, watch for them to be rerun on
David Letterman sometime.

Whatever you do, buy this album.
It’s the best deal for $15 today and it’s
guaranteed to be a classic.

Coping with success

Citizen Cope
Citizen Cope ”

r DreamWor_ks

7L‘ri‘s1/2

VV1th the crowded traditional popscene
present in the music world, it is beneﬁcial
for artists to do something slightly diﬂerent
to be a mainstream success.

While supplying lyrics that are mean-
ingful and tell a story, and using afunkymix
of hard beats, acoustic guitar, piano and
catchy choruses, Clarence Greenwood, a k
a Citizen Cope, provides that different
sound ' needed to break away from the
crowded pop scene.

Greenwood was the live keyboardist
and DJ of the early ‘90s band Basehead.
After the band split up, Greenwood spent
years playing anywhere with a stage.
Playing at local clubs in Washington, D.C.,
he developed his songs and mailed out
demos to various record labels.

After a failed attempt to record with
Capitol Records, Cope has found. the ingre-
dients for success with his self-titled debut
with DrearnWorks Records.

Songs like “Contact,” carry a serious
message. “Contact,” ' which features
Meshell Ndegeocello on bass, addresses the
judicial systems’ tendency to imprison
America’s youth rather than to educate. The
album also provides songs that tend to have
a ﬁghter side such as “Mistaken Identity,”
which tells the story of a woman who every
day would mistake Greenwood for a guy
named Randy, who apparently used to be
the woman’s best friend. ,

Cope also has the timeless love song on
the album in, “If There’s Love,” a celebra-
tion of tender feelings that accompany love.
Greenwood sings, “I’ll hold you close as far

as I can see/If there’s love I hope I just want ’

to have something to do with it.”

Cope has. already earned acclaim from
MTV2; the network has labeled him as an
“Artist to watc ” for-2002, and he is‘ cur-
rently opening for DrearnWorks labelrnate
Nelly Furtado until Mar. 9. He will follow
with his own headlining tour.

VV1th meaningful lyrics and a unique,
funky sound that separates Cope from other
music acts out there today; this album
should make an impact in the music scene,
and send Clarence Greenwood into the
mainstream

Nothing compares

2 Prince

Ifl Was Prince

Various artists
Rex Records
79r<l‘r1/2  

There’s a reason why so many people
steal from Prince, and I’m not just talking
about that whole “slave to his record
company” thing he made a big fuss about
a few years ago. e . '

The tiny Minnesotan is undoubtedly
a seminal ». artist. His pornalicious
basslines and explosive guitar work inﬂu-
ence everyone from Basement ‘Jaxx to
Britney Spears. It’s a shame, then, that
most of the time people really suck at
covering Prince songs.

At ﬁrst, If I Was Prince, Rex
Records’s new compilation of Prince cov-

pers, falls victim to this truism. But the

reworkings of classics like “Dance On”

' and ‘The Most Beautiful" Girl in the

Worl .” aren’t bad, just different from
Prince’s original artistry and innovation.
At_ﬁrst, the songs seem too clever

and postmodern: Trying to reinvent
Prince is like trying to make a peanut but-
ter sandwich with mustard. . '
But British trio Hefner’s jazz and
soul inﬂuences lend a relaxed, romantic
tone to “Controversy.” Singer Josee
Hurlock turns a bitter, aggressive song

- about ignorance into a loungey power

ballad. Blue States add shades of Marvin
Gaye’s. brand of melancholy, shuffling
funk and ‘60s soul bossa nova to
“Alphabet Street” and Simian turns
“Under the Cheny Moon” into a battle-
ready march.

There are a few duds on the album, '

though. Neophyte Brit-popsters Bronze
Age Fox make their major label debut on
Prince by covering “The Most Beautiful
Girl in the World.” They strip away the-
lush- guitar and keyboard arrangements
and add a scratchy, looped bassline. A
talky, corny, lo-ﬁ reworking of “Sexy
Dancer” sounds empty and cheap.

By trying to reinvent Prince’s clever
technical innovations it’s easy to embar-
rass yourself. Comparing the ttmes on If I
Was Prince to the originals is a bad idea,
but they’re nonetheless enjoyable
homages to their petite predecessor.

Tinkering . around
And All That Could

Have Been

Nine Inch Nails
interscope
i‘ri‘r7.“r7i‘r

Following in the tradition of semi-
nal live albums Stop Making Sense, The
Last Waltz and even F rampton Comes
Alive, Nine Inch Nails has produced
And All That Could Have Been, a 16-
tracklive CD chronicling 2000’s force-
ful “Fragility 2.0 Tour.” Without pauses
between songs or for encores, it is
essentially the show you may have seen
on their Pittsburgh stop at The Post-
Gazette Pavilion.

But’ also in the tradition of the
above albums, And All That Could
Have Been continues the discourse on
just how “live” live albums are. The
title of the album, which is NIN’s ﬁrst
live collection, contains a double mean-
ing that, on one hand, works into this
ongoing discussion.

The other meaning is of course’ an
immediate reference to a line in the
punctuating track “Hurt,” which is the
ﬁnal song both here and on l994’s The

-Downward Spiral. The title’s selection

is also steeped in creator/maintainer
Trent Reznor’s characteristic penchant
for obvious album titling (Broken, The
Downward Spiral, The Fragile).

The second meaning attributed to
the album title, on the other hand, asks,

possibly unwittingly, the question of
what “could have been” the live record-
ing, and just how much doctoring goes
on in post-production.

After all, the tour was back in the

_, summer of 2000, so it is apparent that

mastermind Reznor, notorious for
delaying releases as long as he has to,
took his time with making this sound as
right as possible. ’

In fact, Reznor’s thoroughness in
song and album structure is indis-
putable, and until recently, the quality
has been, too. This summer he released
a track for the “Tomb Raider” sound-
track of all things. And the track
“Deep,” was notably parodic and deriv-
ative of NIN structure, except for the
fact that they did it themselves, straight-

, faced. The concern now remains

whether Reznor has run out of hate fuel,

,or that there’s not much more to say

along the lines of pain and anguish.

At any rate, given the cohesiveness
of song ﬂow and sound on And All That
Could Have Been, it doesn’t seem the
point of this album is to capture a live
performance note-for-note," though it
does provide insight into just how much
preparation goes into one of their per-
formances. And in that sense, it illus-
trates the raw technological energy that
is NIN. -

So savor this album,‘ which cap-
tures the intensity of a NIN jam session

the only way one could occur: with as
much planning and tinkering as obses-
sively possible.

One fun trip

Peter Jedick

Creative Arts Book Company
7i‘r*£ri‘r

Even though times have undoubtedly
changed, still, who can resist a story about
the good ol’ days of sex, drugs, and rock
‘n’ roll. . .oh yeah, and the Kent State
Vietnam protest tragedy. .

Peter J edick just couldn’t resist telling
the tale, and so he bestows upon us

— “Hippies.” It’s kind of like “The Wonder

Years goes to college,” and Jedick has
brought us along for the trip — I mean ——
ride.

and his duplex housemates, ‘* three other
guys and four girls. There are all kinds of
issues between the eight little hippies: love,
hate and drug busts — just to name a few.
The tone of the story is pretty light,
especially in the beginning. Easy reading
and genuinely funny tales about Matt and
pals and their adventures are the major
focus._ It‘ does, take a serious turn, though,
that mirrors the events at the end of the
book and the end of their school "year." '
The ending is as abrupt as the gunﬁre
that erupted from the National Guard on
May 4, 1970, when the protesting of the
warlead to the partial destruction of Kent

“Hippies” is the story of Matt Kubick -

quent deaths of four students.

Even though “Hippies” is a testament
to a time that has long since past, it is still
a story for any generation to relate to. It is
a great story about college life that ended
too violently for the students ’at'Kent State.

True to the times, but able to cross
their boundaries as well, “Hippies” stands
out not only as a quality book, ’ but an
important one as well.

Plus, it’s really groovy, man.

There are limitless ways_ to get revenge

the person deserves. What do you do to a7

In Jason Starr’s fourth novel, “Hard 6

THE BEST PLACE FOR Pm" SPORTS NEWS

DON NGUYEN
Staff Writer

For men’s swimming head coach
Chuck Knoles, being the team to
beat is nothing new. For the sixth
consecutive year, his No. 17-ranked
Panthers dominated their regular
season opponents, once again taking
their place as Big East champi-
onship favorites. ‘

By talking to Knoles one learns
that constant success never makes
preparations for the annual confer-
ence showcase any easier. . I

r“I‘am always so tired by-this
time of the year,” Knoles said,

7 “because there are stilla lot of loose

ends to "tie up.before the champi-
onships.” ~ - -
Worrying over the Big East

championsh—ip, which runs from Feb.‘

21-23, presents an ironic twist to the

‘season that the Panthers have had.

The Panthers’ conference oppo—_
nents presented little more than
minor. obstacles for them on their
way to an undefeated conference
record. Big East squads such as
Syracuse, West ' Virginia and
Virginia Tech finished within no
closer than 85 points in each of their
respective meets against the
Panthers (7-1 overall, 5-0 Big East).

One of the stronger teams in -the
conference, Notre Dame, could only
muster a single victory in the 3-
meter diving event, conceding all 11
relays to the victorious Panthers.

All of the previous success sim-
ply means that the Panthers will
travel to the Big East championships
in Long Island, N.Y., knowing that
the conference title will be theirs to
lose.

“[Our regular season] should
translate into great success,” said
senior captain Will Eden. “We are
the best team and have that record

‘ for a reason, so we expect to win the

championship.” . *

Thisis the attitude that Knoles.

instilled in his squad from the first

day of-practice..Add this to the ‘fact V
that no current Panther swimmer has «
ever dealt with a Big :East finish’

lower than ‘first, and it is obvious

-that Knoles’ tenureas coach has cul-

tured an atmosphere of success.
“The guys come from a team
with such a rich.tradition of win-
ning, that even if the other teams
were equal in strength, we would
have the advantage,” Knoles said.
‘Knoles’ point, however, is mere-

ly hypothetical. No other Big East

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Staff Writer

A visibly shaken Traci Waites entered
the post-game press conference last night,
without much to say after-the Panthers lost
3 tight 60-59 meeting to the Scarlet Knights
of Rutgers. The game eliminated the team’s
hopes of making the Big East Tournament

“It was disappointing,” Waites said.
“I’m just really proud of our kids.”

The loss was Pitt’sninth of its last 10
games. Rutgers, ranking 8-17 overall and
5-9 in the Big East, clinched a Big East
Tournament berth with the win. .

Both teams played aggressive perime-
ter defense; Pitt, ranking 7-18 overall and 2-
12 in the Big East, and Rutgers struggled
offensively for much of the first half.

But with three minutes to go inthe ﬁrst

A half, Pitt and Rutgers both raced up and

down the court quickly and started trading
baskets as well as leads. Rutgers’ ﬁeld goal
percentage rose from 17.6 percent to 39.3
percent in the ﬁnal seven minutes, causing

the team to quickly gain a three-point lead.

Pitt guard Haley Harguth hit a three-
pointer with 25 seconds left to tie the game
at 26, but Mauri Horton of Rutgers
answered with a three of her own at the
buzzer to give Rutgers a 29-26 halftime
lead.

Pitt and Rutgers continued to trade bas-
kets in the second half, and with less than
two minutes to go, Rutgers clung to a 58-55

_lead. Pitt guard Lanie Selwyn managed to 1

steal the ball with 1:07 left, setting up one
of the most dramatic ﬁnishes for the team
this season.

Rutgers regained possession, and with

59 seconds to go in the game and the team
trailing by three, Selwyn fouled Horton.
Horton hit both of her free throws to give
Rutgers a 59-55 lead.

Selwyn would retum the favor’ 10 sec-
onds later on a driving basket that got Pitt
back within three. I

Rutgers inbounded the ball to Horton,

who became trapped against the baseline, .

but managed to call a timeout with 44 sec-

Pitt tourney hopes crushed by loss to Rutgers

onds to go. .

Rutgers inbounded the ball again and
set up its half-court offense. The Scarlet
Knights passed the ball around the perime-
ter, trying to kill as much clock time as pos-
sible. VV1th less than ﬁve seconds on the
shot clock, Rutgers threw an errant shot, but
center Dawn McCullough grabbed the
offensive rebound for the Scarlet Knights
with 12 seconds left and was promptly
fouled by Selwyn.

McCullough missed her free throw,

and Pitt grabbed the rebound and called a -

30—second timeout.

With six seconds remaining Pitt
inbounded the ball, trailing by a score of
60-57. Forward Amy Kunich was fouled
on the inbounds pass and hit two free
throws to cut the lead to one, but Rutgers
was able to break the press and run out the
clock to escape the Fitzgerald Field House
with a 60-59 Victory.

Harguth led the Panthers in scoring
with 16 points. Selwyn added 11, and
Brooke Stewart scored 10. S

respect, right? I 4

Wrong. Because the guy who orches-
trated the whole thing, head coach Ben
Howland, is rarely, if ever, mentioned as a
legitimate national head coach of the year
candidate.

What Howland has done with the Pitt

‘basketball p1o'g_ramunder the current cir-

 hothhig short of miraculous.
He took a team that was" young and in

shambles, occasionally dressing as few as
‘eight people, and in the course of just three

seasons, turned it into a top-10 program.
He is coaching a team that has no
legitimate stars, but each player buys into
his system completely and gets the job
done on defense and underneath the bas-
ket .
Heading into this season, Pitt was still
riding ‘high on its unexpected National

Invitational Tournament appearance, but ,
the prospects for the new year were some- ‘

what bleak

Pitt lost two of its best players in All-
Conference forward Ricardo Greer and
center Isaac Hawkins, and Howland’s
efforts to recruit a big man were subpar at
best. Many of the centers that Howland
pursued most aggressively fell through the

cracks, and in a Big East conference loaded ’

with talent, Pitt appeared to have very few
impact players. . 4

Pitt was projected to ﬁnish sixth in the
Big East western division, and nobody,
including myself, expected Pitt to match
the success that they had in 2000.

Which just makes Howland’s accom-
plishment all the more amazing. Pitt is 22-
4, and is in the driver’s seat in the Big East
West. With its remaining schedule, it is not
inconceivable that it could win out and end
the regular season with 25 wins, a division

. title, and a No. 1 seed for the Big East tour-

nament. _ i y _ t

V worthy candidates. Knight,
who left Indiana two years ago in the midst
of controversy and bitterness, has raised
the Red Raiders out of the depths of the
Big 12 conference and led them to an
improbable NCAA tournament birth.
Harrick’s Dawgs, who were supposed
to have been going through a “rebuilding”
season, have played one of the toughest
schedules in "the country and sit atop the
competitive Southeastern Conference
Eastern division standings with a 19-7
record .
While I have nothing but respect for

I both»_“The General” and “The Greased
One,” I would argue that their names are V

being thrown around more for what they

have done, in the past than what they are

doing this season.

Harrick . I won a National
Championship with ﬂie UCLA Bruins, and
Knight is one of the winningest coaches of
all time. VV1th respect to Georgia’s strength
of schedule, Pitt has more wins and is

ranked far higher in the polls than Georgia .

this season, and Knight’s Red Raiders are
currently a bubble team. 

I’m not saying that Howland should
win the award, but he has come too far and
done too much this season to not at least be
mentioned for it. The national media
should at least make an effort to make this
a three-man race instead of a one—on-one
contest. ‘ '

At least give him some respect; every
good race needs an upstart underdog. And
how can (you argue with Dickie EV?

“I-lowland is awwwwwwesome, bay-bee!”

Michael Cunningham is a columnist for
The Pitt News, and would like to mention
that if anyone out there has any NCAA
tourney tickets that they're dying to part

with, feel free to e-mail him at.

Late run nearly propels gynasts over C. Michigan

KEITH PARADISE
Staff Writer

Trailing Central Michigan going
into the ﬁnal event of the evening,
Pitt head coach Debbie Yohman hud-
dled ‘her team in a corner and spoke
with them brieﬂy before they compet-
ed in the ﬂoor exercise competition.

“I _brought them over,” Yohman
said after the meet. “I asked .them to
perform. The kids were doing it for
pride. They wanted to see how far
they could come back without letting
it get from them again.”

What she said worked.

Five Panther gymnasts scored
new career-highs as Pitt posted a new
team record in the floor exercise with
a score of 49.325, but the effort could
not overcome the Chippewas as Pitt
was narrowly defeated 195.95 to
193.95, in a tri—meet that also includ-
ed third place Ursinus College.

Pitt senior Raya Mullin turned in
her finest performance of the season,
tying or breaking her season best in
the three events in which she compet-
ed. Mullin began her evening on the
uneven parallel bars, swinging her
way to a tie for first with a season-
best score of 9.85.

Mullin went on to tie her career-
best on the balance beam with a score
of 9.825. Her grand finale,_along with
her teammates, came in the ﬂoor
exercise routine, where she scored a
personal best of 9.85, landing her in a
five—way tie for second place in the
event

Mullin said she’s feeling more
confident, and the rest of the team is
feeling the same way.

“Our spirits are up,” Mullin said.
“Everyone is excited about thenext
weekend and each meet we’re just
happy about our performances and

looking forward to improve it.”

The Panthers also received a solid
performance from sophomore
Diandra O’Connor.

On the balancebeam, she scored
above her season average with a 9.75.
In addition, .O’Connor played a key
part in the record-setting ﬂoor exer-
cise competition, scoring a personal
best 9.875, which propelled her to
third place in all-around points, with a
score of 38.525.

It“ was Central Michigan’s one-
two combination of Sarah Dame and
Kara Reighard that propelled it to the
slim victory. ‘

Dame ﬁnished in first place for
all-around points with a score of 39.2
while her teammate Reighard finished
second with a score of 38.85.

Reighard showed why the Mid-
American Conference has named her
gymnast of the week twice this sea-
son.

She finished tied for first with
Mullin for her performance on the
uneven parallel bars with a score of
9.85, and was also part of the five-
way tie for second place in the floor
exercise with a score of 9.85.
Central’s Michelle Orlorski scored a
9.9 on her .ﬂoor exercise routine to
secure first place.

The Panthers are now 6-6 for the
season and 1-2 in-the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League. Their next three
meets are on the road, starting with
Illinois this Saturday.

With the season half over,
Yohman likes what she is seeing from
her team, especially the intensity dis-
played near the end of the meet on
Saturday.

“The kids had to do something
that they couldn’t do last year,”
Yohman said, “and this is real encour-
aging to me.”

WES BRYANT/PHOTO EDITOR

Pitt finished in second place over the weekend, after nearly topping Central
Michigan in its tri—meet. Ursinus College finished in third place.

Swimmers confident in pursuit of sixth straight title

Championships, page 15

faction is close to the level of talent that the
Panthers boast this season.

Even Rutgers, who lost to the Panthers by
only 4 points, provided little more than a learning
point for a team that otherwise dominated its
conference opponents.

“As the circumstances would have it,” said
junior Raymond Brush, “Rutgers swam its in-
season bests against us and we swam our in sea-
son worst.”

Glancing over the best Big East times for the
season, the Panthers have every right to be confi-
dent about their chances going into the Big. East
championships. Panther swimmers occupy the
top times in seven out of the 13 individual
events, by far the most of any unit.

In the relays, which are of utmost importance

in the tournament because of their point value,
the Panthers possess the conference top times in
four out of the five events. Rutgers holds the best
time in the 400 free relay event, beating the
Panthers’ best time by a miniscule .06 seconds.

That .06 seconds is all that "stands in the way
for. the Panthers to sweep all five relay events,
assuming they can duplicate their performances
from earlier this season.

Sweepingthe relays would all but assure the‘-

Panthers’ sixth consecutive conference crown,
which is a stunning achievement within itself.
But sweeping the relays would also present a
career first for Knoles, who is in his 12th season
at the helm of the men’s swimming program.
“With all of the great teams I have had here at
Pitt, I have never had a team sweep all five of the
relay events in the championships,” Knoles said.
However confident they may be, the Panthers

realize that the Big East championships'i~will not
be as easy as their regular season would indicate.

« In contrast to regular season competitions,
the championships differ in that only the best
swimmers from each stable are permitted to par-

ticipate, which increases the talent level of the

tournament as a whole.

Knoles will be taking 23 of his swimmers .-

with him to Long Island, which will be by far the
tournament’s strongest representation. This is a
testament to the talent and expectations that Pitt
has. ' , ~ ,

“We’re very realistic about our abilities and
what we are capable of, and right now we are
capable of beating any team in the conference,”
sophomore standout Eric Limkemann said._ “I’m
not saying we’re going to have the championship
handed to us, but we know what we have to do to
take it.” ‘
