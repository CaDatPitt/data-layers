Man May Exist in New World
Of Mind, Speaker Asserts

By J. n. cmssnn
At some time everyone
senses that there is an in-
tensity of feeling around

*»"’him, especially at a time.like
- Christmas when the atmos-

_phere seemes charged with
unusual emotion. Colin Wilson,
who spoke at noon at Wednes-
day’s Student.Union Board Mid-

day Series, tries to experience-

this feeling the entire year, exist-
in a new non-physical world.
Wilson believes that allof us
experience an intensity of emo-
tion, but the existentialist tries
to make it continue. The ability-

to exist in more than just the“

physical world, to retreat into.

.,Q'the world of the mind through a:

book, or a memory separates man
from the animals, Wilson pointed
out. Man has the. potential to
possess a new «dimension of free-
dom, but he is still 99 per cent
animal and can't completely exist
in the new ,_realm. .

Wilson compared man to the

it early amphibians," who, -would

crawl out of the ocean forshort

vbfperiodsl of-_ time only to retreat.
’~" back to the sea to sustain them-

selves. In the same way man can
venture into the new world of
the mind for short periods of
time but," incapable of living
there, must return. to his physi-
cal world. This is clearly shown,
he ,said, by the experiments of
psychologists who place a sub-
ject in a soundproof room with

;‘,':’t’;g'no connection to the physical
world. Man can stand thislack:

‘Since the time ’of~Newm‘an man.
has opened new mental realms
which have helped to cut the in-
ﬂuence of religion and priests.
With. man's new powers of in-’
sight he could ﬁnd the meanings
of the universe from within with-
out the aid of others. Man's mind,
therefore, is capable of God-like
activity but his body ties him to
the" physical environment.
The problem for man is to

Appointments Made

P The formation of ‘committees to study the new C011Stit11-

.,ux._tion and the issue of free speech and the disseminatibn of
”"‘ literature in the dorms highlighted theﬁrst business_meet—

ing of the newly-elected Student Government (SG) Wednes-
day. In further action, the Senate chose Loren Hershey, Lib-
eral arts sophomore, as president pro-tempore andapproved

the. cabinet recommendations of
President Ralph Manning.

Both committees will report
back to SG.and make recommen-
dations on their respective issues.
The constitution committee, chair-
ed by Dyanne Hochman, must
make its report by March 2.

The senate tabled the bill/which

_\ xjyvould have declared the Towers-
"/Quadrangle Committee on rules

on distribution of literature null
and void. SG suggested that Man-
ning attend Monday's meeting of
the Towers-Quadrangle Commit-
tee. The members of SG’s com-
mittee to study these rules will
be announced later.

Hershey, the new president
pro-tempore, was elected unani-
mously by acclamation. He is a
philosophy major and co-chair-
an of the Hill Education Project.
Manning's seven position cabi-
net, approved» by the Senate, _in-

ler, director of publicity; Mitch-
ell Pearlman, director of ﬁnance;
Sarah Jones, director of.research;
Beverly Humenuk, recording sec-
retary; Susan Wajcicki, corres-
ponding secretary; and Karen
Leppe, executive secretary.

As a new policy, Manning con-
ducted a brief informal discus-
sion period with the SG members
before the meeting was called to
order. Discussion of minor prob-
lems not worthy of discussion
during the formal meeting will
be permitted at these sessions,
Manning noted.

Manning also announced his
selections for various SG commit-
tees. Besides Miss. Hochman, the
Constitution Committee includes
Senators Cathy Baierl, Michael
Em“. Terry Hyman, and Jerry

' the present. He must create “fac-

reaches only when using drugs
or when on the verge of a great
event such as dying. -
Wilson is known as one of.the
ﬁrst “angry young men". although
he denies the label. He reached
fame at the age of 24 when his

book, The Outsider, became pop-~

um’ in 1966.

.University" Proposes State ' Tie Bill 
        Higher Education Group   
 Reviews New Proposal  

By MARSHA BEHNS .

The University’s bill for a closer state affiliation must be _
redesigned by the State Council on Higher Education before 
Governor William Scranton. will call a special session of the
1966 State legislature to create the new state relation. The
State Board of Education proposed the revision and reject-
ed complete approval of the present bill at ,a- meeting in » P

Harrisburg, yesterday.

The Governor must call a spe-
cial session to change the Univer-
sity’s status since the present ,

legislature can deal only with - I"

ﬁscal matters. The Governor stip-

ulated that any proposed plan

would need the approval of the.
Board of Education and biparti-

san acceptance by legislative

leaders of both parties before he
would consider calling the ses-
sion. .

, Once the special session is call-
ed it would take approximately
two months before any plan could
be put into effect. The revision

of the University’s bill termed-

“favorable” by officials could
mean a _ delay of two to four
weeks. It was not known whether
the Council would change the
plan or simply wanted more time
to consider the present one.

— The proposed plan,. similar to
one in elfect for Temple Univer-
sity, establishes state support for
all schools _ of the. University.
State funds based on costs per
student. would lower the tuition
of all graduate and undergrad-
uate students from Pennsylvania;
to $450 per year. Tuition for out-
of-state students would remain at
$1,600 per year unless the legis-
lature speciﬁed otherwise.

The University would also re-
ceive annual allocations from the
General State Authority (GSA)
for planning and developing
which, under the present arrange-

ment, are on a loan basis only. ,

Total appropriations could reach
 estimated $18 million.

The University’s Board of Trus-
tees would consist of 37 mem-
bers, six of whom \would be ap-
pointed by the Governor. There
would be four ex-officio mem-
bers: the Governor, the Mayor of
Pittsburgh, the state Superinten-
dent of Education, and the Chan-
cellor. “The state,” according to
acting Chancellor ’ David Kurtz-
man, “would participate, not
dominate.”

State funds’ and private dona-
tions would be audited separate-
ly, the 'tate having veto power
only over its own funds.

Unlike the recent Ford Foun-
dation plan, the bill, drawn up

DR. DAVID KURTZMAN 
Discusses State Plans

the option for undergraduate. sup- .~
port, only, as proposed by Ford._'_
The bill was approved by a 20.0,‘
to one vote of the University Fac-
ulty Senate, the largest vote in
its history. i V
According to Dr. Kurtzman, an 
“across the board” plan is the
most practical as “there is pre- 
sently "no way of differentiating ‘
between undergraduate and grad-
uate expenditures.” Furthermore}
complete subsidy would,‘ allow
“top notch professors in the grad ‘
uate schools to teach undergrad
uates ‘and prevent the University,
' from becoming known‘ as an 
dergraduate school only,” Dr. A:
Kurtzman said.  , f
Dr. Kurtunan spoke with" lead- j
ers of both legislative houses gnd
parties, Monday, to meet the Gov-‘
ernor’s second stipulation, and 1

If a manifest function of color
films is to entertain, a latent func-
tion is their tendency to dull the
public’s visual appetite for the

_ black-and-white ﬁlms. Magazines

and some newspapers are follow-
ing suit by adding pages of color
photography, and now even the
most enchanting black-and-white
television commercials have been
remade in colors ,

The paradox is that although
the quest for" color would seem
to be a natural development 
since the quest for color would
seem to be a -natural develop-
ment—since life itself is in Todd
AO, Panavision, and Color by
Momma Nature,-—it is unnatural
for the medium of photography
to be thought of as excluding
black - and - white representation,
since black-and-white came ﬁrst.

The success of several recent
ﬁlms indicates the importance of
maintaining both means of ex-
pression. To imagine The Sound
of Music, The Tenth Victim, Tom
Jones, or Thunderball in black-
and-white would be impossible;
color plays a role too valuable in
communicating vitality to be
eliminated.

However, the opposite may be
said for many successful black-

iBi11hoar’di

 

 

  I “Black andiWhite”

and-white ventures, which could
well suffer artistically‘ if color
were added. The Pawnbroker, Re-
pulsion, The Train, and--yet to
arrive in Pittsburgh—A Thou-
sand Clowns are only several
ﬁlms in which bright color might
prove to be “semantic noise” di-
verting attention from the dia-
logue, sound eﬁects, movement,
or forms on the screen.‘

This is not to say that color
cannot be used in the “deeper”-
ﬁlms. Several years ago, a ﬁlm .
titled The Lovers of Teruel made,
interesting use of dream scenes
in color, and Red Desert connect-
ed speciﬁc colors with psycho-
logical meanings. Juliet of the

black-and-white‘s advantage —- as
with the cat at the right——is to
heighten concentration upon
space relationships. Besides, it’s
cheaper.


COLOR/LESS? 

Spirits marked Federico Fellini’s
ﬁrstvuse of color.
The real problem, then, is to

suit the ﬁlm script to the proper
medium. Black - and - white was
“right” for Repulsion because it
effectively accentedeonly the su-
penseful movement of forms. Col-
or was “right” for The Sound of
Music because it brought vibran-
cy to the lively music and move-
ment.

The advantages are different,
but each is relaying information
relevant to "mood and theme. Col-

SnaiI’s Pace Legislation  

The pace is still- slow, the need is still urgent. That’s
the status of the University’s endeavor to gain a plan for
increased state affiliation by September. .
Yesterday's action by the State Board of Higher Edu-
cation is typical of the jockeying which has been and will
be going on until the State and University develop a com-

     

    
     
 
 
   
   

 

The philosophy of student affairs at the
University seems to have as its primary
goals preserving the status quo, stunting
innovation, and denying students the maxi-
mum opportunity to assume responsibility.
The advising system in extra-curricular ac-
tivities reflects this out-dated, dysfunction-
al view. ' .

One prime example of the deficiencies
of the advising outlook is Vice-Chancellor
Helen Rush’s appointment of John Vrana

student affairs, even those involving ﬁn-
ances. He should encourage students to un-
dertake jobs, make decisions, and learn the
nature and limits of responsibility.

Present conditions in student affairs do
not represent thisattitude toward students.
For example, there are an average of three
administration members serving as advisers
at every SG meeting. Each gets up at the
end of a meeting to either praise or scold.

six seconds remained, but Abra-

Lenny Kalata opened the over-
time scoring with a steal and a
layup, but the Dukes reeled off
six straight to take a four point
lead. Within aminute and a half,
Dave Welty sandwiched two bas-
kets around Tony DeLisio’s free
throw; and the frosh had a one
point bulge. ‘

Again Duquesne held the ball
for the ﬁnal shot. With eight

DeLisio dribbled out the last sec-

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Bad news was mixed with the good last night. The bas-
ketball team broke their ﬁve ‘game losing streak by outlast-
ing Carnegie Tech, 68-62. Offsetting the victory was Bob
Lovett’s suffering a Joadly sprained ankle, making him a
doubtful starter in tomorrow's clash with. Temple at the

Field House.

“We’ll -be hurting against Tem-
ple without Lovett,” said coach
Bob Timmons. “We’ve already
lost one forward Ken Bollens. I
may have to move (Stan) Falen-
ski inside and put (Pete) Smith
with (Larry) Szykowny in the
backcourt.

“Falenski doesn’t have the
height,” Timmons continued, “but
he gets the rebounds.” He also
scores the points when the
cagers need them. Playing with
three personal fouls from the be-
ginning of the‘ second half against
Tech, Falenski scored 12 points
after the intermission; 14 for the

“We didn’t expect to get hurt
-the way we did by Falenski,”
said Tech coach Mel Cratsley.
“He was hitting those long ones
that killed us.” ,

Cratsley had set up, his defense
to stop Lovett and Szykowny.
Add Jim LaValley’s ﬁne night to
the Falenski‘ surprise and a clear
picture of the game emerges.

In addition to scoring 15 points,-
most coming from under the bas-
ket on layups and tap-ins, LaVal-
ley grabbed 11 rebounds. “He
controlled the boards,” Cratsley
said. <

The hoopsters were also “up.”
They played a tight defense that
switched from a man-for-man to
a zone to a semi-press. The re-
sult was a see-saw battle. .

The game was tied ‘four times
in the ﬁrst half until Lovett and
Szykowny created a lead. Lovett
made a free throw that broke a
21-21 deadlock and Szykowny
made two jump shots that in-
creased the margin. With three
seconds left, Lovett hit on a
corner jump shot that gave the
hoopsters a 31-25 halftime edge.

Szykowny’s 18 points was‘ the
team’s high. His ten in the» ﬁrst
half offset a similar perform-
ance by Tech’s> Don Keefer. Keef-
.er had nine points, in the ﬁrst
half ‘and 19 for the game. \

Carnegie Tech had a hot shoot-
ing hand in the second half. The
Tartans hit six straight jump
shots, taking a 39-33 .lead. But six

foul shots by Szykowny and two.

field goals by Falenski gave the
hoopster’s a permanent lead.
_Tech couldn't do too much af-
ter the 10 minute mark of the
second half. Since the hoopsters
had the one-and-one bonus rule
on their side from that time on,

_‘ Cratsley had, his “Tech squad
V “up” for the game. The pre-game
buildup brought 2,007 people to

ents were there for the Tartan
upset, but it never came.
