Senate Council and SGB clueless regarding student, faculty, and staff representation

Mr Bl k a

     

 

As the Board of Trustees prepares to
decide the fate of students, faculty, and
staff on its committees, Pitt’s highest-rank-
ing administrators and faculty still have no
indication what the outcome will be.

Members of the Senate Council and
Student Government Board said that they

have been questioning the Board for
weeks, but the Trustees have remained
silent.

That fact touched off a heated debate
at yesterday’s Senate Council meeting
about how to approach the Board when
members don’t know exactly what they’re
up against.

“It strikes me as not only ‘curious, but
really a sad commentary on the University,

A sleek burgundy car speeds through a red light and around
the comer at the Bigelow and Forbes intersection. Pitt Bike Patrol
officers Sharmon Santucci and Tracy Mason give each other a
knowing look as Santucci calls for backup.

Suddenly they are off and quickly weaving through the rush
hour traffic. They rapidly advance towards the car as it travels
down Forbes Avenue to CMU. Catching the car across from the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theater, Santucci proceeds to issue a
stern warning to the shocked driver of the vehicle. It is all in a
day’s work for the Pitt Police Bike Patrol.

In March of 1994, Pitt’s Department of Public Safety added
a new unit to the campus police force, the bike patrol. Bike patrols

have recently been gaining popularity on college campuses and _

on city police forces throughout the country. Some say they allow
police officers to interact with the people they serve on a more
personal level which encourages more open communication.

Bike officers say they can better maneuver in and out of traf-
ﬁc to reach the scene of a crime faster than an officer in a vehicle.
They can also use alleyways, areas of grass, and stairwells to their
advantage. _ i

“We can get to a call quicker than any other unit,” said

Santucci, “We could be on McKee Street and possibly get to the
Cathedral before a car unit or even the foot patrol assigned to that
area.”
While police bike patrols enable ofﬁcers to reach the scene of
a crime rapidly, the safety of those same officers is often put in
jeopardy. Bike officers often enter the scene while the crime is in
progress. This places them in a dangerous position.

“One of the dangers of bike patrol is that [the ofﬁcers] arrive
on the scene when it is going down. They are getting there as it is
happening,” stated Captain Timothy Delaney who leads the Bike
Patrol division of the Pitt Police, “Plus they have just pumped

that we have all these people in various
positions, like the chancellor and the
provost, and no one knows what the Board
of Trustees is‘ doing,” professor Mark
Ginsburg told council members.
According to Ginsburg, it doesn’t
matter which side of the issue you fall on,
the Board is not acting in a democratic
way.

Young workers ‘are leaping out of
Pittsburgh’s stagnant economy, and may-
oral candidate Bob O’Connor says he
wants to stop the city government from
selling the city out from under their feet.

In an interview held at his Squirrel
Hill campaign headquarters, the city
councilman said the student vote is too
often neglected. He ‘said the student voice
is important because they are the future
of the city.

Listening to the students

“I’m running for young people,” said
O’Connor. “They have been neglected
mainly because they don’t vote, but they
are the future.”

O’Connor considers himself “Pitt’s

 

going to avoid the problem. It’s just going
to make it worse because people will feel
they are suppressing debate and discus-
sion,” he said.

Despite the fact that no one knows just
what the resolution says, many members,
including Student Government Board
President Justin DalMolin, suggested that
Senate Council members write to the

ground of working closely with the
University Greeks, helping them to raise
money for the charities beneﬁting from
Greek Week festivities by arranging
donations and reducing the cost of the
event.

In November, O’Connor met with a
group of 15 University of Pittsburgh stu-
dents to get a view of life in Pittsburgh
“from their perspective,” he said.

Several of the students told him that
they would stay in the city if they knew
they could get a job, but unless things
change, they will most likely leave.

So that is one of the matters
O’Connor has chosen to focus on.

“We need to keep people here,” said
O’Connor. “The 18 to 40-year-olds have
the most to gain in a growing city.”

his governrnent’s achievements in providing
basic services to poor blacks and warned
extremists that the era of violence was over.
Mandela also promised to stop the growing
crime rate that is deterring foreign invest-

almost eliminated the political violence that
had formerly been a big problem in South
Africa.

‘There is no reason at all for any of our
citizens to seek redress ’
through violence,” Mandela said. ‘flt will be
the height of folly for anyone to seek to pro-
voke the patience of a people who have elect-

Warning: Mixing medicines
may be hazardous to health  

Scarleﬂe Corbin

 

Tylenol, Sudafed, NyQuil ———-
they’re all harmless drugs we use to
cure the minor illnesses of life: At least
students may think they are harmless.

When these and many other com-
mon drugs are used together, they may

JCEIUSC more harm than good.

According to Pitt Student Health
pharmacist Paul Ferraro, this is a com-_
mon problem among college students,
especially when alcohol is added into
the equation.

“Alcohol interacts with antihista-
mines, antibiotics, antifungals, antimi-
.crobials, acid reducers, sedatives, anti-
depressants, and more. Some of these
interactions are simply additive seda-
tive effect .— you get much more
drowsy than you would expect.

“This can be of particular harm
when being awake and aware is impor-
tant — when driving a car, for
instance,” said Ferraro.

Ferraro said that Tylenol also
reacts with alcohol. He also said the
reaction depends on the amount of
alcohol, the dosage of Tylenol, and the
time period in which the two were
taken.

“Some of the newest [over-the-
counter] medicines have the greatest
potential to interact in some way with
other drugs,” Ferraro said.

Many drugs that pose a danger
when used in conjunction with other
interacting drugs are common over-
the—counter drugs.

For example: Tagamet HB can
react with: theophylline, an asthma
drug; warfarin, a blood thinner; and
phenytoin, which is used for seizures.

Even if the interacting drugs don’t
cause a severe reaction, they can
sometimes end up doing exactly the

' opposite of what a user may expect.

Taking Sudafed and NyQuil at the
same time will not give you a clear

 

head and a good night sleep. Instead,
you’ll probably be up all night and be
very irritable, because of an overdose
of pseudoephedrine, an ingredient in
both medications.

Unfortunately, sometimes doctors
inadvertently prescribe two interacting
drugs. Many do not receive the same
extensive training in drug interactions
that pharmacists do. _

“This is one of the best reasons for
having a doctor and a pharmacist. A
checks and balance situation results.
Pharmacists are trained to catch these
mistakes and to prevent them from
happening,” Ferraro said.

“But, since no one is infallible, the
patient is responsible for looking after
themselves as well. So each patient
has three people looking after their

well being, at least — ideally, their-

doctor, their pharmacist, and them-
selves.”

If you think that you have been
taking two interacting drugs, Ferraro
suggested that you should call your
doctor or pharmacist immediately. You
may be advised to stop taking one or
both of the medications.

Some drugs, however, are used
speciﬁcally because they do interact.
A doctor may prescribe two opposing
drugs because their effect may be what
is needed to cure an illness. The best
thing to do is ask.

The effects of drug interactions
can range from insignificant and unno-
ticeable to life-threatening. The reac-
tion depends on the patient, the drug,
and the particular circumstances of the
interaction.

Because of the problem of drug
interaction, several books have been
written on the subject.

Fortunately, severe drug interac-
tions can be avoided with a little bit of
caution. Read the directions that come
with medications before you take
them, and consult not only a physi-
cian, but also a pharmacist.

 

their way there and their legs may feel rub-
bery.”

Despite the dangers Pitt Bike Patrol
officers face, the officers themselves and the
Pitt community in general feel the bike unit
is a necessary component within the campus
police force. It took Delaney months to per-
suade the Pitt Police Department of this fact,
however.

“Before we started this unit,” said
Delaney with a chuckle, “my old boss who
retired said he forgot how many times he
kicked me out of his ofﬁce about what he
termed ‘this stupid proposal?”

Delaney went on to mention that Pitt

 

“ I ,.   ‘- FROM PAGE I  

Police Chief Rick Boyd was extremely
receptive of the idea from the moment he
took over leadership of the Pitt Police force.

Delaney attributed this receptiveness to
the fact that Boyd previously served. at
Michigan State University and had the
opportunity to see a bike patrol unit in action
on a college campus.

The Pitt Police Department was able to
receive funding from the administration to
outﬁt and train officers in a specialized bike
umt.

O'Connor 

The Councilman says it is a problem
that can only be solved by creating an
effective city management that is respon-
sible to its residents and responsibly
spends tax dollars.

But building a strong city takes
money. And money, O’Connor says, has
been leaking out of the city coffers at tax-
payers’ expense.

“I’m a manager,” he said. “And with
me, the buck stops here.”

No more nonsense

“I’m disappointed in the operation of
the city,” said O’Connor. “I think I can
do better.”

Not hesitating, he spoke knowing
what he wanted to say and didn’t stam-
mer. His ofﬁce in the headquarters was
sparsely decorated, and campaign paper-
work, facts and ﬁgures, sat before him.

“I think we have to concentrate on
the management of the city,” he said.

O’Connor said he believes
Pittsburgh can start to solve at least some
of its problems by collecting debts that
the city currently chooses not to aggres-
sively pursue.

He gave an example of how, in the
past two years, the city has allowed about
$12 million, in Emergency Medical
Services bills alone, to go uncollected.

While about half of that is uncol-
lectible because people receiving the ser-
vice don’t have insurance, he said the
other half can be collected.

“I’m not talking about us going after
some poor widow without insurance out
there, either,” said O’Connor. Instead, he
said he just wants to get the money the
city is properly owed.

Sitting upright and leaning into his
desk, he crossed his hands and his voice
was relaxed. But his eyebrows tensed
and brow fuirowed as he discussed the

V matter.

“We’re leaving a lot of money on the
table,” he stated.

O’Connor related how pursuing this
debt would bring that extra $3 million a
year into Pittsburgh’s budget.

But, he said, that is not the only place
Pittsburgh is loosing money.

According to O’Connor, Pittsburgh
recently sold a $20 million debt to
OTSD, a Florida based lien purchasing
company, for $16 million. OTSD then
was able to pursue the unclaimed money
with a $4 million proﬁt.

“If OTSD could do it,”
O’Connor, “then why
[Pittsburgh]?”

Another company, Prins Recycling
Corporation, purchased a $600,000 con-
tract in October of 1995 from the city for
the exclusive rights to process
Pittsburgh’s recyclable materials.

When Prins hadn’t paid anything
after nearly 6 months, O’Connor said he
investigated the issue, discovered they
had similarly defaulted on a contract in
Baltimore County, and brought it to the

said
can’t

attention of the mayor’s ofﬁce.

O’Connor said, in his monthly col-
umn for the Greenﬁeld Grapevine, that
the city’s lack of inspection led not only
to a loss of revenue, but later led to
Pittsburgh purchasing a contract for
newspaper recycling which cost the same
million a year it was supposed to save.

“We haven’t run a very efﬁcient
ship,” he said, leaning back slightly in his
chair.

Placing his closed ﬁsts on the desk
before him, O’Connor said that
Pittsburgh has to hire ﬁnancial profes-
sionals with experience in organizations
like the IRS to review Pittsburgh’s
ﬁnances and ﬁnd out where problems
such as these lie.

“The city isn’t managed very well.
You’ve got a million here and a million
there,” said O’Connor. “and that adds

99

up.

Job Hunling

“The city  must serve its residents,”
said O’Connor.

He explained that the city could cre-
ate more jobs by simply examining its
policies.

O’Connor then gave an example of
how one ﬁre department staff in the city
is approximately 80 people short. This
results in Pittsburgh having to pay many
of those ﬁre ﬁghters almost double. their
normal wages because of overtime.

Instead of overworking all these
workers and risking accidents, O’Connor
said the city should take the money spent
on overtime and send 80 more people to
work.

“It’s already paid for!” said
O’Connor as he jabbed his ﬁnger at
papers verifying the facts. “It’s not like
it’s going to cost [the taxpayer] more!”

Recently criticized by Mayor

Murphy for trying to appropriate money
for 140 local fire ﬁghting jobs, O’Connor
said that he was trying to give the mayor
ﬂexibility.
_ O’Connor said he wanted to appro-
priate the $4 million in the budget
because, if the bill passes in arbitration,
the money would at least be available to
pay for it.

“Now, if he loses, he must ﬁnd the
$4 million somewhere,” said O’Connor.

O’Connor said he thinks he can be
more open, straightforward, and honest
in managing Pittsburgh.

“It’s a big advantage not to have a
political background. I can be more open
and honest,” he said. “I am doing it for
what I believe in.”

Amid stacks of campaign signs and
piles of buttons, O’Connor gave a ﬁrm
handshake as he prepared to return to his
busy schedule. He paused for a moment,
his hands on his hips, and looked at the

' paperwork spread out on the headquar-

ters desks around him.
“I’m in it to serve the people,” he
said, “not make a buck.”

DalMolin told the Senate Council that
he plans to submit a formal proposal
opposing any elimination of student, fac-
ulty, or staff participation on Board com-
rnittees.

“This is by no means ﬁnal at this

DalMolin’s peremptory approach is
backed by Brian Ulery, president of the

“I think it’s important to have your

“Since we really don’t know for sure
the substance of the report  you might

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg deliber-
ately stayed out of yesterday’s debate.

“My position has been that construc-
tive relationships between University con-
stituent groups are important,”
Nordenberg said. “But there are a lot of
ways to deﬁne what a ‘constructive rela-
tionship’ is,” he added.

The issue ﬁrst originated last year
when “The University of Pittsburgh
Review,” better known as the Fisher
Report, recommended that all non—trustees
be eliminated from the committees.

Connolly appointed an ad hoc com-
mittee to study. the issue, and the resolu-
tion on the agenda for the February 20th
meeting is based on that committees’ rec-
ommendations.

was subcontracted jointly by the City of
Pittsburgh Police Department and the Pitt
Police to provide training right on Pitt’s
us. .

"There have been some units that have
started out on bikes and they weren’t prop-
erly trained. They gave them money to
make them look nice and told them to go
ahead,” stated Delaney, “We believe the
more we train and the more we make [the
Pitt Bike Patrol] specialized, the more suc-
cessful the program is.”

The training has paid off immensely on
many occasions, one involving veteran bike
patrol officer, Rick Troy. Troy chased a rob-
bery suspect from the Howard Johnson
University Center through South Oakland as
the suspect ran through backyards and alley-
ways. Troy never quit in the chase. He
pedaled hard through yards; threw his bike
over fences; and pedaled hard again -
sometimes carrying his bike over his shoul-
ders on unridable ground — until he appre-
hended the suspect on Bouquet Street.

Along with the training, bike officers
are provided with premiere mountain bikes
and Gore-tex outerwear made of water-and-

 

ROM PAGE 3

  

wind resistant material that is custom made
to provide a perfect ﬁt for the body. The offi-
cers also wear bullet-proof vests at all times.

Like many other specialized units, the
Pitt Bike Patrol often ﬁnds itself at the cen-
ter of controversy. Some can’t look past the
bikes and the custom-rnade garments to ﬁnd
the reasoning behind such a patrol.

“[Some people] look at them like

they’re prima donnas,” said Delaney, "They

look at them and they say they look nice.
They look at them and say they have the best
of everything; but not so many people want
to pay the price that these oﬂicers pay
either.”

Pitt Bike Patrol officers are open and

“There are people out there who will
gun for you,” stated Sarah Skoog, a bike
oﬂicer currently on maternal leave, “When
they see a police oﬂicer on a bike it’s like
extra points for some people.”

All bike oﬂicers commented that city
traffic is one of their main concerns while on
the bike beat

“You have to know the traffic patterns,”
said Broadway, “I think [the bike beat] is
more dangerous than a regular beat primari-
ly because of the traﬂic.”

28 Years on Your Piﬂ Campus

While Pitt bike officers can be found
patrolling the campus and surrounding
areas, they can also be found participating in
community relations. The image of the Pitt
Police Department is important to the
administration, and for that reason the Bike
Patrol was created as a means to connect stu-
dents with Pitt law enforcement

“It’s a diiferent type of patrol than a reg-
ular beat in a vehicle,” said Bobby
Broadway, a bike oﬂicer of three years,
“You see more things and you build a better

The ad hoc committee of the
Board of Trustees will be pre-
senting its recommendation for
whether or not faculty, staff, and
students will be removed from
their respective committees on
the Board on February 20.

J. W. Connolly, the chairman
of the Board, has already made it
known that he wants all faculty,
staff, and students to be removed
from their roles within the
Board. ' ‘

This came up for discussion
at the University Senate Meeting
yesterday. In attendance at that

THE PITT NES

meeting were Chancellor
Nordenberg, who is the Pitt com-
munities liaison to the Board,
Provost Maher, and members of
the Student Government Board,
including the president, Justin
DalMolin. The chancellor, the
provost, and SGB do not seem to
know anything in regards to the
goings on of the Board of
Trustees. It’s little wonder that
the Board wants them out of the
committees. It is time for them to
get off of their respective keis—
ters and find out what is going
on.

 

It would be a travesty for
students, staff, and faculty to be
shut out of the Board of Trustees.
The Board has a tendency to do
most of its business in unofficial,
secret meetings rather than at the
required public meetings.

Those people who are
involved with the Board, such as
the chancellor, the provost, and
SGB need to be on top of what is
going on. If they don’t know
what is going on now, we will be
screwed when we lose our repre-
sentation on the Board. What

Making the Board of

zation which makes decisions
that affect the student body, staff,

without any input from any of
those groups would further the

kind of student affairs committee

The article “FAS
Presentations Over, etc.” in the
Thursday, Feb. 6, edition of The
Pitt News contained two erroneous
statements that require immediate
correction. ‘

The first point concerns
Provost Maher’s interest in pro-
moting “creative cooperation”
across departments and his appar-
ent disappointment at the long
delay in seeing such cooperation
realized, i.e., “It’s been tlnee years
now, and it’s just nothappening.”
The implication that the depart-
ments in Category IV were
requested to work on such consol-
idations three years ago (and have
not done so) is false. The Provost
may have been misled by wording
of Dean Koehler’s charge to FPAC
(the committee currently review-
ing FAS departments). Consider
the wording of FPAC’s charge: “In
order to bring closure to Phase II of
the planning process, decisions
need to be made about category
reassignments and the future sup-
port for the graduate programs of
the category IV departments. We
have held off doing so while we
asked these departments to explore
possibilities for some consolida-
tion of their individual graduate
programs which would enhance
scholarship and pedagogy within
the resource constraints.”

These statements seriously
misrepresent the actual timeline of
events.

Here are the facts of the mat-
ter. In the FAS Phase II plan of
April 1995, our departments were
placed in Category IV, which was

designated a “holding” category.
The deans promised that Category
IV departments would be assigned
to new categories by May 1996.
For 13 months, then, the depart-
ments could do nothing but wait
for their reassignments. In May
1996, the deans failed to reassign
these departments and continued
to refer to category IV as a “hold-
ing” category. Again, the depart-
ments were forced to wait for clar-
iﬁcation of their status.

On Dec. 4, 1996, secret pro-
posals for the fates of Category IV
departments were presented to the
FAS—PBC. These secret proposals,
however, were soon leaked, and so
the deans were forced (ﬁnally) to
bring the affected departments into
the process. Indeed, it was only on
Dec. 16, 1996, that the chairs of
Category IV departments were
advised to begin to search for ways
to collaborate in their graduate
programs. Consequently, the
Category IV departments have not
had three years, but rather only six
weeks “to explore the possibilities
for some consolidation of their
individual graduate programs”
before FPAC began to meet. While
the chairs of the Category IV
departments would have been
willing to participate in this
process for the past few years, they
have only been given a legitimate
opportunity to do so in the past

month and a half.

In addition, we would also

like to point out that much in the

way of “creative cooperation” has
already been taking place, not only
among these departments but with

 

other departments throughout
FAS.

The second point that requires
clariﬁcation concerns the follow-
ing paragraph from the article: “I
think that a lot of [reallocation]
could be through cooperation
across department lines,” Maher
said. ‘That would give more of the
critical mass [that programs of
lower quality] need to be  recog-
nized.”

Here the problem rests’ with
the interpolation, “[that programs
of lower quality].” Clearly, there is
confusion here between size (criti-
cal mass) and quality. While it is
the case that many ofthe PhD pro-
grams facing elimination are
small, many of them are neverthe-
less excellent and attract and pro-
duce excellent students. It is our
belief that the reporter misunder-
stood the provost, who, we are
conﬁdent, would never confuse
quantity and quality.

the words “programs of lower

programs, whatever their size or
quality, were being referred to by
the provost at that point in the
interview.

  Phewwwy!
What the hell
stinks so bad?

 

The Big East Conference, the
conference that prides itself on
physical play and tough defense, is
now forced to defend itself for
prominence in the national spot-
light.

The Big East was one of the
nation’s premier conferences from
the mid-1980s to the early 1990s,
regularly sending teams like
Georgetown, Syracuse, and
Villanova to the Final Four.

But this season, the Big East has
looked like the Big Easy. The con-
ference has a paltry 2-15 record
against non-conference teams
ranked in the Top 25. Against the
nation’s» three elite conferences, the
ACC, SEC, and Big Ten, the Big
East is 7-14.

,Instead of beating teams like
North Carolina or Kentucky, Big
East teams have been able to pad
their schedules with wins against
powerhouses like Carnegie Mellon

"and Columbia, schools with great

grad schools but not great basketball
teams.

Villanova is currently the only
team in the Top 25, and following
their 93-56 blowout by Kentucky on
Sunday, are sure to drop to the lower
half of the Top 25. ‘Nova and
Providence are tied for the best
overall record at only 17-6 and look
like the only conference teams
assured of a NCAA at-large bid.

No team has emerged to show
dominance within the league either,
as the conference is loaded with sec-
ond-tier teams. Boston College
owns the best conference mark but

dislocated ﬁnger, and a few herniated

disks all added up to a disappointing
weekend for the Panther wrestling team.

The bad news started on Friday
morning when the Panthers learned that
starting 142-pounder Larry Sprecher
will miss the rest of the season due to a

neck injury.

The bad luck continued for Pitt on
Saturday night when they stumbled
against conference rival Lock Haven.
They then traveled up to Clarion to take
on another EWL foe, only to come away
with a tie in a match they could have

0 lead.

“We didn’t wrestle bad, but we
could have wrestled better,” Panther
190-pounder Mark Bodo said of
Saturday’s loss at 14th-ranked Lock
Haven. “A couple of matches came
down to the last 30 seconds, but we just
missed some opportunities.”

A takedown with 10 seconds left in
the match by Lock Haven’s Mike
Kusick gave the Bald Eagles an early 3-

Pitt true freshman Rob Loper'con-
tinued his stellar season with a 5-2 vic-

tory at 126 and evened the team score at
three. Chad Jesko followed that up with

a 14-4 major decision at 134 which put

the Panthers up by four.

Pitt’s Mike Dixon drew the unfortu-

 

nate task of wrestling the number one-
ranked 142-pounder in the nation, Cary
Kolat. Kolat won by way of a pin—fall
and put Lock Haven back on top 9-7.
The win was Kolat’s 100th career win;
his all-time record now is an unbeliev-
able 100-7 (14-0 this season).

Victories by two more nationally
ranked Lock Haven grapplers —- Mike
Rogers at 150 and Brian Leitzel at 158
-— increased their lead to 16-7.

Hundreds tune in to Trecia Smith show

eotf Moak

   

Last weekend’s Frank
Sevinge Husker Invitational
track meet at the University
of Nebraska was misnamed.
The Trecia Smith Show
would have been more
appropriate.

Pitt’s sophomore stand-
out was named Outstanding
Female Athlete at the meet.
Smith set school and meet
records in the long jump and
triple jump, with jumps of
21-9 and 45-3 1/2, respec-
tively.

It wasn’t supposed to
happen that way. The star of
the show was supposed to be
senior Angee Henry of
Nebraska, winning in front
of the home crowd. Henry is
the defending indoor nation-
al champion in the long

jump. Before last weekend,
she was leading the nation in
that event again this year.

Smith’s triple jump of
43-6 1/2 two weekends ago
at George Mason was
already the nation’s best.
She further distanced herself
from the rest of the country
in that event, and now she is
the national leader in the
long jump as well.

“Her biggest problem,
and it’s a problem for a lot of
athletes, is that she’s doing
so many events that it’s hard
to concentrate on just one,”
said Pitt Assistant Coach
Najuma Fletcher. “She’s get-
ting enough experience now
to focus on each event sepa-
rately. She’s maturing a lot.”

In addition to S1nith’s
two first-place finishes,
Angie Martin and Chantee
Earl were third and sixth in

the 800 meters with times of
2:10.16 and 2:13.41. The
men’s distance medley relay
team of Scott Curry, Carl
Taylor, Rich Walsh, and
Scott Gilpen was fifth in
10:10.54. Jack Jeffreys was
eighth in the 60-meter hur-
dles with 8.48, and Jerel
Williams was also eighth in
the 200 meters with 22.62.

Many more of the
Panthers had good days that
went unnoticed, because
even though their perfor-
mances were exceptional,
they weren’t good enough to
move them past preliminary
heats in their events.

“This is set up to be a
very competitive meet. The
kids know it; everyone
going in there knows it,”
said Pitt Head Coach Steve
Lewis.

All told, the meet saw

over 100 performances that
qualify for the NCAA cham-
pionship meet.

“I’m very impressed
with our whole team, the
men and the women,” Lewis
said. “The one factor that
separates this meet from oth-
ers is the competition. Our
teams did a great job com-
peting against the people
who were there.”

Things don’t get any
easier next weekend. The
Big East Championship
meet is next Saturday and
Sunday at Syracuse.

V “There is no doubt in
my mind that the most com-
petitive conference in
America is the Big East,”
Lewis said. ‘‘All the teams
have people who could be in
the top 10 in the country.
Honestly, every team is the
team to beat.”

Pair of Panthers sidelined in 9-8 loss to Ohio U  

 

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team lost

more than just an important section
game last Saturday night.

In their last—second, 8-7 loss at
the Cost Center, the Panthers lost
two players to injury as a result of a
very physical game with first year
team Ohio University.

The loss dropped the Panthers’
record to 0-1 in the Allegheny North
section and 1-1 overall.

“It was the hardest hitting game
I’ve seen in a long time,” Head
Coach Gary Neft said. “We lost some
players, maybe some of them for the
year. We’ll need two or three days to
recover from this game.”

The Panthers were without two
starters to begin with. Tom Evans
was sick in bed all week and could
not play, and Freshman Dave
Corrado was home on Long Island,
where his ﬂight back to Pittsburgh
was delayed because of snow.

Last week at St. Vincent,
Corrado scored two goals and added
four assists. His offensive presence
was clearly missed at the Cost Center
on Saturday.

The Panthers lost players Eddie
Kline, with an undisclosed knee
injury, and Brian Novotny, with a
thumb injury. It is unclear as to when

the two will return to the Panthers’
lineup.

As for the Pitt offense, the
Panthers were not as sharp as last
week when they torched St. Vincent
College with 11 goals.

“The offense didn’t play well at
all. The defense played well, but our
offense didn’t,” Neft said. “Our
attackers _had a bad game and it"
showed. Our mid-
fielders played well,
scoring 6 of our 7
goals. But our attack-
ers just had an off
day.”

Team co—captain
Rob Heapes got the
Panthers off to a good
start with two goals,
and finished the game
with a hat trick.
However, Ohio, who

didn’t lead the game it      if

until the final score, fought back an
kept the game close.

“Our defense played well, but we
made some key mental errors and
took some dumb penalties that just
killed us,” co—captain Pat Shea said.

The Panthers game plan was to
play a very physical game and try to
stop Ohio University’s leading scorer
Dave Lewis. Lewis burned the
Panthers and finished the game with
four goals.

 

“Our focus was on Lewis. We
double—teamed him and we always
had a man on him, but he still man-
aged four goals,” Shea said.

The Panthers led most of the con-
test and never trailed until the clos-
ing minute of play, but with under 30
seconds in the fourth quarter, a loose
ball sprung free in front of senior
goaltender Dave Travis and ended up

in the back of the net
1 for an Ohio
University victory.
Junior midfielder
Brett Meyer—Kincak
netted two goals, and
junior midfielder
Steve Love added one
goal. Senior Marc
Polecritti was the
only attacker to score
a goal for the
~ ‘A ' Panthers.
‘ “Unfortunately, the
game didn’t turn out for us,”
Polecritti said. “We didn’t know
what to expect from them, because
they are a first—year team. It’s a
tough way to go out. We could have
won if we took less penalties.
Penalties just killed us. Now we need
to win the rest of our games to stay in
playoff contention.”

The Panthers have two weeks to
recover before hosting Wheeling
College on Friday, Feb. 8 at 8 p.m.

eighth in the country, won in double-

period.

Yet another ranked Lock Haven
grappler — number-two, Mike Geurin
— upped the team score to 19-10 with
his 6-1 decision at 177.

Pitt’s Mark Bodo, ranked sixth in
the nation at 190, beat his former high
school teammate Kevin Drew by a score
of 3-2 to cut Lock Haven’s lead to six.

“It’s always close when I wrestle
him,” Bodo explained. “We used to
practice together, so he knows my
style.”

Panther heavyweight Matt Mueller .

impressive 3-1 minor decision.
Unfortunately for Pitt, they still trailed

Pitt 21 Clarion 21

Pitt faced another small school with
a solid wrestling team on Sunday when
they traveled to Clarion to take on the
Golden Eagles.

“It was a match we could have won,
but didn’t,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “I thought we wrestled
tougher than we did against Lock
Haven.” ‘

A dislocated ﬁnger caused a nine
point swing in Clarion’s favor and ulti-
mately was the difference in the match.

Jacob Schaus had the upper hand in
the match, with a 10-8 lead in the third
period. His ﬁnger popped out of socket
and the trainers could not get it back in.
The injury default gave Clarion six
points and took away the three points
Pitt would have had in his victory.

“It’s those types of things that are so

frustrating,” Stottlemyer said. “We
wrestled real well, but something like
that happens.

“A lot of times a guy will get a dis-
located ﬁnger and we’ll pop it back in,
tape it up, and go on with the match.
Jake’s just wouldn’t go back in.”

The match started off a little shaky

for Pitt, with Clarion’s Sheldon Thomas, V

ranked number one in the nation, earn-
ing a major decision at 118.

Loper put the Panthers back on top
with a technical fall at 126, which made
the team score 5-4..

Clarion won the next two bouts at
134 and 142 with ﬁfth-ranked Chris
Marshall the victor at 134.

Pitt cut the score to 10-8 with Kevin
Johnson’s 7-4 victory at the 150 pound
weight class, but Schaus’s injury default
at 158 put the Panthers deeper into a
hole.

Pitt responded though; Withrow
pinned his opponent at 167, cutting
Clarion’s lead to two points.

Bryan Matusic’s 9-2 victory at 177
put the Panthers back on top, and Bodo’s
17-6 win increased Pitt’s lead to 21-16.

Up by ﬁve heading into the heavy-
weight match is usually a good formula,
but freshman Matt Mueller wrestled the
fourth-ranked heavyweight in the
nation, Bryan Stout, who won by way of
a technical fall and left the score knotted

It doesn't take long to get addicted to smokeless tobacco
& it is not a safe substitute for cigarettes. Smokeless
tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes.

Brian Knavish

Redshirt junior Larry Sprecher
had struggled all week to lose over
twenty pounds so he could drop to

- the 142 weight class. He finally

made weight on Wednesday, but then
on Friday he learned his nagging
neck injury was more serious than
first believed and will cause him to
miss the remainder of the season.

An MRI revealed that surgery
will be needed to repair the three
herniated disks in Sprecher’s neck
which are flattening his spinal
chord.

“In a way I guess I’m lucky,” a
frustrated Sprecher explained. “The

 

Tuesday, February 'I ‘I, 1997

 

doctors said that -if I had wrestled
and twisted my neck the wrong way,
I could have been paralyzed.”

Sprecher originally injured his
neck during Christmas break at the
Wilkes tournament. He had been
experiencing “Stingers” ever since
then, but they became more frequent
in practice in recent weeks.

Doctors will remove bone frag-
ment’s from Sprecher’s hip and use
them to fuse the vertebrae together.
They will then insert a metal rod to
add strength and support to his neck.

“The doctors said I will have
more mobility once I recover, so in
the long run it will help me,” said
Sprecher who has one more year of
athletic eligibility remaining.

 

they are only 9-4, which is hardly
an outstanding record.

These records certainly do not
demand the elite status that many
Big East programs claim to have.

The reasons for the Big East’s
fall from power are not entirely
clear. Certainly the conference’s
star appeal was dampened last year
when Allen Iverson and Ray Allen
bolted early to become NBA lottery
picks. With these two players,
Georgetown and U Conn would
have added appeal and wouldn’t
have such average records. I’m sure
that people aren’t going to want to
see Ya-Ya Dia and Ricky Moore
when they could be seeing Iverson
and Allen.

Another reason for the Big
East’s lack of national prestige
might be the buzzword around col-

FROM PAGE 7 -2

lege basketball this season: parity.

In many ways, the Big East mir-
rors the entire NCAA in failing to
produce a clear-cut national power-
house. In the last week alone, the
top three teams (Kansas, Wake
Forest, and Kentucky) all lost,
showing that the national title race
will be at least interesting even if it
is unable to produce a great team.

So the Big East is not alone in
showcasing second-rate teams. But
with so many teams swimming in a
sea of mediocrity, many Big East
teams are content with just trying to
stay afloat.
