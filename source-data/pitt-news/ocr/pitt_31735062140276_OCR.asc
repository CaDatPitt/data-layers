HOLIDAY TO BE DECLARED

Tremendous Power of University

is Sufficient Cause .to Make

V Entire City Join in Celebration

of the Oldest Institution West
of the Alleghenies.

 

February 28th, 1912, the University
will celebrate its 125th birthday. At
the meeting of the board of ‘trustees,
held Monday, March 13th, partial
plans were adopted for the great cel-
ebration. This is to have many feat-
ures. The program is to include the
oraxtions ‘of the occasion, which will
be heard in tliemorning, an histori-
cal survey to be given in the after-

~n'oon, a banquet to be held in the

‘evening, appropriate serviceslin the
churches and schools of the city and
other‘ things yet to be announced. Mr.

‘ _W. L. Scaife has been made the chair-

man of the program committee and
will choose others to serve with him.
He has a task worthy of the best ef-
fort and certainly every student and
friend of the Universitv' will be glad
.to help make the celebration appro-
priate and adequate. I

It is a matter of congratulation to
any student that he is a member of
an institution of such ancient and
honorable history as Pitt. It is .a
thing for still greater rejoicing‘ to
have ‘a share in celebrating the 125th
birthday. The students cannot begin
too soon to plan for their very great
part in this anniversary. Their en-
thusiasm and zeal will be necessary
for its success, and for their own
satisfaction in the entire affair. Stu-
dents have a reputation for ingenui-

 The mvultitudinous p_oints of con-_
tact between the University and the-

history of Pittsburgh and, of Western
Pennsylvania supply ‘a rich field in
which'this ingenuity can play. Cer-
tainly the celebration will necessitate
the most earnest effort on the part
of the students in order to make it
what it ought to be.

Dr. W. J. Holland is chairman of
the committee which willdetermine

g The annual dinner of the School of
Economics was held Saturday even-
ing at Fort Pitt H0-tel with a full
attendance of the faculty and students.
The trustees of the school along with
a number of invited guests were
.present to enjoy the dinner. The
famous Dutch room of the ho-tel was
t‘he scene of the dinner, the capacity
of which was tlaxed by the number
present. H. C. Carpenter of the
Senior class was the toastmaster, re-
sponses being made by Chancellor
McCormick, Doctor Linhart, Dean
Holdsworth, George H. -Clapp, Pro-
fessor Beck, Doctor Prost, Doctor
Hobsvon, W. A. Wettach; Professors
Smith, Shaffer, Main,
others. All t he addresses were spirit-

enthusiasm. Without a doubt the af-
fair was a splendid success and a
credit~to the school of economics.

Students will Celebrate Close of
Term in Mirth—Leading Engi-
neers to Make Speeches.

'The banquet of theSchool of En-

the Monongahela House at 8 o’clock
on Friday, will be a ﬁtting close to
the present term as it gives the engi-
neers a good opportunity to celebrate
the wind-up of exiaminautions. More-
over, it will probably afford the last
chance in a long time’ for students in
all classes to get together, as the
whole Junior class starts out on
practical work the very beginning of
next term.

From all indications the affair will
prove a very interesting one, as in
addition to the students practically
all the engineering faculty and several

hand. and clever speeches, both
serious and otherwise, are promised.

William Jennings Bryan, perhaps,

to have addressed the students in

account‘ of having to‘ leave on an
early train Wednesday morning, to
keep an out of town engagement, Mr.
Bryan was unable to fulﬁl the engage-

was unable to speak, as he is one of

The Magee memorial fountain,
which will occupy a- conspicous posi-

soon be a reality, if the reports con-
cerning its construction are 'au'thora-

plans for the erection of the beauti-

The team sent against us from Al-

of thorough preparation in a know-

superior to our team. They present-

most feared, and presented ‘them

While it is no doubt true that the
Pittsburg academy which later became
the University of Pittsburgh, received
its charter before the academy at
Washington, in reality W=as'hin‘gtoii

before the one founded in Pittsburgh.
The ‘mere fact that the government

fore Washington academy received its

the same institution and was doing the

There is conclusive -evidence that
there was an academy in Washington
in 1781, which is just six years before
t‘h-erg was an institution of that kind
in Pittsburgh. Many schools have
made claims of being older than
Washington and Jefferson, but in each
instance they have failed to produce
the necessary proof and we will still
maintain that we have a perfect right
founded on undispiitable fact, to sing,
“We are the oldest college from the
Allleghenvies west.”

Allison, la Freshman, will be-. heard
from in the future. He was as calm
and logical as a veteran. Consider-
ing the fact that he started with no
experience, he is deserving of special
commendation for the work he has
accomplished. Mr. Robert H. Wet-

THE - DEBATE.

The signal victory achieved by the
University debaters last Friday even-
ing is but another instance of the for-
ward movement of the University of
Pittsburgh. Last fall our football
players established a r-ecord of envia-
ble ne-pute on 't'he‘griduiron, and now
the brain forces of the institution
have come to the fore and equally
claimed a share of the glory going to
the credit -of alma mater. The mem-
‘bers of the debating teams, the men
going out for the trials, Professor
Fish, and all those connected with

the intercollegiate event, are entitled’

to the hearty songratulation of the
faculty and the students. The affirma-

_",tive team won the victory, but the

upholders of the negative, the men

I debating at‘Wooster, -are also sharers

of the spoils of success because their
efforts were just as determined as

those put forth by the men at home. ‘

But, aside from the mere conse-
quences of triumph in a debate there
is a greater beneﬁt derived. The pop-
ularity ‘of the old form ‘of intercol-
legiate tests has been reaffirmed in
a conclusive manner bv the enthusi-
-asm attending the preparation of the
debate and the general interest of
the students. A nearby college re-

' cently lamented the fact that her stu-
‘ dents had lost interest in the exposi-

tion -of ‘live questions through the
medium of the debate. It is cheering
to note that no such condition exists
in the University of Pittsburgh.‘ The
reward of last week should be suf-
ficient incentive to the Forensic So-
ciety and its members to make the
intercollegiate debate next year a dou-
ble triumph, by winning both the
negative and affirmative sides of th-e
argument. »

THE COLLEGE WOMAN.

The college woman presents an in-
teresti'ng study in this age of airships
and other ﬂighty things. A hundred
years ago woman was the embodi-
ment of charm, grace ‘and enchant-
ment, her principal virtute lying in
the fact that she was at home builder,
able to guide the destiny of her chil-
dren. Today the magic wand_ of time
has transformed the scene and woman

ATHLETIC’ PROGRAMS.

The students in a general meetingi
held last Wednesday were called upon 
to judge a—ma:tter most vital to the?
two undergraduate publications in‘
the University, of Pittsburgh--the
Owl and the Weekly, namely, Wheth-~
er their future careers are to be en-

the solicitation of advertising by the!
athletic committee for the programs’:
issued in the autumn for football and
inthe spring for the annual intercol-

A motion was made and seconded“
that a resolution belsent the c0mmit—j
_tee, through the graduate manager of
athletics, embodying the sentiment of
the students against the tactics em-
ployed in the athletic programs. The
action taken by the students is most
commendable, in that it shows a ready
sympathy for that which is their own’
possession. The annual _product of%

Reception Given in Honor of

” High Schools is Great Success

Event Last Thursday Evening is Largely Attended by Members of
Senior High School Classes--Student Senate Conducts Affair
With Ease and Ability—Program is Most lnteresting to the

Audience.

The reception on Thursday evening,
March 16, by the Student Senate, to
the various High Schools and Prepar-
atory schools of the vicinity of Greater
Pittsburgr, was successful in every
sense of the word.

Th-aw H.all was brilliantly lighted
from top to bottom, and the corridors
and chapel were ﬁlled with some three
hundred High School students, inter-
mingling with the students of Pitt, in
true college fashion. An lair of ease
and of “right at home feeling” seem-
ed to' surround the gathering which
made its success sure from the start.

This seemed to have a great‘ effect
on the visitors and everyone entered
into the others affairs of the evening
in the, spirit of “it is my University
and I have .a deep feeling of joy and
pride in this fact.”

After the early program refresh-
ments were served, and then dlaancing
held the center of attraction until
11:45, when the reception broke up.

All during the evening small tour-
ing parties, with some Pitt student as
guide, would make trips all over t-he
different floors of the building, ob-
serving the class rooms, the labora-
tories and the general equipment of
the University. Everyone seemed very
well impressed with our University,
and, no doubt, when n-e-xt September
comes, many of our guests of Thurs-
day nightiwill be enrolled as students
in the University of Pittsburgh.

The committee from the Student
Senate deserves very great credit for
the most successful manner in. which

they planned and carried out their‘

plans for this event.

Mr. Smith Meets Socialist

Eccentric Character Causes In-
structor to Miss Joy of Hear-
ing Intercollegiate Debate.

While the iorators of the University
were girding themselves for the big

inter—collegiate debate last Friday
evening, a tall, laingular man, wearing]
an imitation shamrock in his button-l
hole, strode insolently into Thaw Halli
and demanded an audience with “the?

U _ _ _n_ _ ,m.an around here, who knows every—§
.n1vers1ty, w1 mg at any time to‘

thing about socialism.” The under-I3
graidulate, to -whom his remarks were‘
addressed, noting the long hair of thel
man and the wild glare in his ey-es,l
which are popularly supposed to be
the chief identiﬁcation marks of the
thoroughbred socialist,,veriy promptly
and properlydirected him to Mr. R.
D. Smith.

Thereupon ensued an argument that
put to shame the best efforts of the
slpell-binders in another part of the
building. Now, Mr. Smith desired to
hear the intercollegiatle debates very
much, but, alas, he could no-t detach
himself from .h.is worthy opponent.
Besides, that might be an .ald~mi.ssion
of defeat; and the learned gentlle-man
never admits. Neither would it be
hospitable. Consequently the in-
structor missed the entire clash with
the pride of Allegheny.‘ At that, it
took him all of three hours to con-
vince his long-haired friend that his
views and statistics in regard to his

espoused cause are all at fault. On ’

good »authority, it is statled that the
man left the ‘hall in anger and dis-
gust. ’

._..»_._j

A James J. Long of Pittsburgh Sun 
Thinks Manager Hurst Has 1'

Given Best Schedule in History ‘
of University. 1

The 1911 football schedule arranged
by Graduate Manager Laurence B.§
Hurst has been the cause of much
favorable ‘newspaper comment. The‘
following editorial from‘ the pen of
James J. Long, the well known sport-
ing authority of The Pittsburg Sun,
explains itself. ‘

That all of the great professional
and college football we have seen in
the past was but leading up to the real
feast is now evident, for the schedule
which has just been announced by the
University of Pittsburgh football
management for’ next fall indicates
that we are entering upon a new pig-

Th\e Blue and Gold has become a
power on the gridiron, is still on the
rise, and the day seems to be coming
when Pittsburgh will "be printed in
type as large as that used to feature
any other city on the football map. V

Graduate Manager Laurence B.
Hurst has made a splendid record
since he took charge of Pi'tt’s football
affairs apart from the playing end, but
he has outdone himself since the close
of last season in the
schedule he has put together for 1911.
It is unquestionably the best college
program ever arranged for acollege
in this part of the country, and if Pitt
can go through it with an even fairly
creditable showing the institution’s
football standing will be many points
higher after next Thanksgiving day
than it was at the close of the sensa-
tional 1910 seiazson.
