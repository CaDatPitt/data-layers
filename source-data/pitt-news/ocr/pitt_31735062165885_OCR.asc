Anti-i~Meter
Petitions End

 Wednesday

The Pitt News anti-parking
meter petitions will be collected
together Wednesday afternoon for
ﬁnal tabulation and preparation
for submission to Pittsburgh City
Council.

More than 1,500 names have
been signed to the petitions. Cop-

rorities and Enginers, havenot yet
been included in the count and
more signatures, particularly from
faculty members and evening stu-
dents, are expected to be collected
-this week.

Matthew Swetonic, Pitt News
news editor and chairman of the

“'1‘he response is stronger than
we _had imagined.‘ We urge all
students, however, to‘ sign the
petitions now before the ‘cam-
paign ends on Wednesday.”

Swetonic added that the peti-
tion will be given to Council prior
to their vote on the meter pro-
posal. The body has‘ indicated that
students will be given the chance
to explain their stand on the issue
and to suggest alternate methods
of dealing with Oakland’s parking
problem.

“We feel our alternate plans de-
serve a hearing,” Swetonic said,
“and the fact that students would
be forced to use parking lots. is

Clinic Planned

The University School of
Dentistry is ‘establishing a
cancer detection clinic for the
purposesof ﬁnding oral can-
cer, according to Dr. Anand
P} Chaudhry, professor and

chairman of the department of
pathology in the School of den-

 tistry. ‘

“A modern dentist is not only
"expected to restore decayed teeth,

O ~ replace lost teeth, or establish the

health of diseased ginvivae, but
also he is expected to recognize
other oral diseases which may be
entirely local in character or may
be manifestations ‘of some sys-

tematic disorders,” Dr. Chaudhry,

stated.

One Out of Seven
“One out of every seven people
will die from cancer,” he continu-
ed.” About ﬁve per cent of these
people will have cancer of the
oral cavity. _
“Due to its superﬁcial loca-
tion, oral cancer is easily re-
cognizable and offers an excel-
lent prognosis if detected and
treated early,” Dr. Chaudhry
explained". “Over half the cases
are first seen by the private
dentist. A lot more cases of oral
cancer can be cured than any
other cancer. Approximately 90
per cent of all cases are cured.”
In order to train dentists to de-
tect this disease in its early stage,
the cancer detection center will
provide diagnostic, facilities. f o r
the practicing dentists. “Patients
who are screened, at the depart-
ment of oral diagnosis in the den-
tal school and who need further
investigation and diagnosis will
also be seen at this clinic,” He
remarked. *

Center To Get Face-Lift

SH Undergoes O

Renovation

The University school of
Pharmacy and Dentistry an-
nounced a two phase develop-
ment program Thursday
which includes the renovation,
of Salk Hall and the building
of a dental outpatient hospital; ,

The first phase, which is a two
million dollar renovation of Salk
Hall, will provide 100,000 square"
feet of useable space. The out-
patient hospital, costing about
three million dollars, will connect
with Salk Hall and will provide
approximately 52,000 square feet
of space. ' , ' ‘

Completion by 1965 _,

Scheduled for completion by
early 19'65, Salk Hall will then
be used jointly by the two schools.

The basement will house joint’

locker and animal rooms,_ stu-
dent lounges and p0st—graduate
lounges, according to Dr. Charles
Frederick, Brand, associate dean
of the School of Dentistry.

“The first floor will be mostly
dental -offices, a cleft‘ palate
clinic, and a dental hygiene
clinic,” Dr. Brand explained."
“The second ﬂoor will be de-
voted to teaching pre-clinical
dentistry and a behavioral clin-
1c.” L A ‘

The third and fourth floors of
Salk Hall will be used for dental
research and the seventh and
eighth floors for pharmacy re-
search. Both the schools of Phar-
macy and Dentistry will use the
ﬁfth floor for research, Dr. Brand
continued. — -

Teaching Facilities

The sixthﬁoor will house phar- '

macy‘ teaching facilities and the
ninth will be a joint" administra-
tive area. f
At present Salk Hall houses
the Allegheny County Health
Department, some offices of the
University School of Nursing,‘
and serves as a dorm for some
of the male students.

A study of the relationship
of a supervised dental hygiene
program to the frequency of
dental decay, will be made of
1000 students in grades one
through ‘six in the Northern
Butler County Joint School Dis-
trict. The program was made pos-
sible through a grant awarded to
the’ University Department of
Preventive Dentistry by a large
toothpaste manufacturing com-

pany.
Another grant of $37,279 was

 . given to the School of Pharmacy

by the National Institutes of
a basis for the broadening of its
research activities.

The new psychlopharmocology

opened last Thursday, were es-
tablished under a third grant, a
$502,942 ﬁve-year grant from the

it ‘ National I n s t i t u t e of Mental

-Health.

Methods developed through in-
tensive analysis in this new fa-
cility-would be eventually utilized
to investigate experimental drugs
for possible use in treatment of
mental disease, according to of-
ﬁcials of NIMH. _ ‘

termine if there is a relation-
ship between the saliva and the
number of cavities found dur-
ing the examinations, will be

 ‘_-directed by Dr. Gerald J. Cox,

professor and chairman of the
research division of the School
of Dentistry. '

The statistical analysis will be
conducted in conjunction with the
University computer center by Dr.

Joyce Hall, graduates of Temple
University School of Dental Hy-
giene, will conduct the dental hy-

The General Research Support
Grant from the NIT will help the
School of Pharmacy to continue
it research programs in phar-
macology, pharmacognosy, phar-

nomics.

 

The sum received was based
on the amount of federal and
industrial support spent by the
school last‘ year in its research
activities.

“The outpatient "hospital, the
second phase of the‘ program, will
be built at ground level and will
be three‘ stories high,” Dr. Brand
said. “The cancer detection clinic,
the crown and bridge clinic, ra-
diology laboratories and the para-
donic and orthodontic department
will be located here.” ‘

‘0peratories’

There will be 216 “operatories”
or dental treatment areas located
in the hospital and an additional
60 treatment areas located in Salk
Hall. This will enable 276 people
to be treated at the same time.

“This is the ﬁrst concrete

physical improvement in the
School of Dentistry since 1912,”
Dr. Brand commented. “Our
main problem is that we are
lacking space for research. No
one can stay today -what re-
search will be tomorrow. With
the new developments we will
have room for expansion.”

‘The second ﬂoor of _the new
hospital will be level with the
basement of Sa1k.Hal1 and will
connect with the hall by means
of a wing. The third ﬂoor of the
hospital will connect with the ﬁrst
floor of Salk Hall. The connect-
ing wing between the hospital
and the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Salk Hall
will be used for administrative

Of LAD Drugs

The School of Pharma'cy’s’ de-

deals with the synthesis of chem-
ical ‘compounds related to Lyser-

used as an investigational drug in
research on the cause and treat-
ment of mental illness."

LAD has been know to pro-
duce bizzare effects on the human
,mind including hallucination and
colored vision.

If compounds more simple than
LAD, but not chemically related
to it, can be prepared, an insight
into the nature of mental illness
might be gained.

Payment ‘ S‘ystem 

Under Study

Prescription expenditures are
the third biggest item on the na-
tion’s bill for illness, following
only the costs of hospital care
and physicians’ service, accord-
ign to Dr. Joseph D. lVIcEvila,
professor and head of the de-
partment of Pharmacy Adminis-
tration in the University’s School
of Pharmacy.

Dr. McEvilla is director of a
study being made of prepaid pres-
cription service for the American
Pharmaceutical Association Foun-
dation. In a report to the founda-
tion he noted that Americans ob-
tained prescriptions at the rate
of four per person in 1960. In
1941 the rate was one and one-
half prescriptions per person.

During the period from 1941 to
1960 the cost for prescribed med-
ication rose 434 percent, from 93
cents to $3.19. .4 _ A

According to Dr. McEvilla, this
rise is partially due to‘ the ec-
onomic factor that has affected
everything else since ‘World War
II, the fact that today’s dollars
is not the same dollar one had
to spend back then.

Student Government President
Tom Olofson, explained at Thurs-
day’s meeting of old and new
senators that he believes the in-
stallation of parking meters
around the University is inevit-
able.

“I think that the turnover in
parking places may eventually be
advantageous. I agree with the
administration in that four hour
meters instead of two hour ones
should be installed and that rates
should be no more than ﬁve cents
an hour,” Olofson continued.

No Compromise

!———-—Strong Policy Needed . . .

Prejudice Pu rsued

By Irv C-arfinkel

T ing what could be done to elimi-

« The student body’s first step in a plan to voice its7eel-
ings on the proposed additional parking meters for the

Cathedral area will end this Wednesday, the last day for '

circulation of petitions. Representatives will then present
the petition to Pittsburgh City Council and, if given the
opportunity, will outline suggestions for alternative solu-
tions to the are'a’s parking problem. I _
One of the suggested solutions is compromise. Both the
administration and Student Government have endorsed a
.parking meter plan which would not be as harsh as the one
Vwhich will be presented to Council. SG and the adminis-
trators have stated that ﬁve cent per hour parking_ meters
of the four hour variety would be acceptable to their way
of thinking. ,
More than 1,500 students, faculty members and their
supporters do not agree with this, however. This is how

many have signed The Pitt News. anti-parking meter peti- ,

tion, and more names are being added at this very moment.
-They have signed and are now signing that protest in
anattempt to convince City Council to do anything but in-

‘ ' stall the meters. Meters as suggested by SG and the admin-

istration would be more favorable than the ones proposed
now, but only as the very last resort.

The administrators and SG leaders would like to, do
the most for the general student body, but they feel‘ pres-
sures which the students do not. The University,'for ex-
ample, has had many differencesrof opinion and policy in its
expansion plans with the Pittsburgh Urban Renewal Auth-
ority, the newspapers, and several sensitive citizens. It has
ap arently decided not to risk antagonizing any of them on
t is particular matter of parking meters. SG, by the same
token, is again exhibiting its recently acquired ‘method of
functioning in the students’ behalf by looking more and
more to the administration for its opinions and assents. V

Neither group seems to remember that, with the instal-
lation of parking meters, students who spend the entire day
at the University will have no choice but to resort to park-
ing lots. ,

' Compromise is practically as distasteful as the original

. ‘meter proposal itself. The administration is not going to be

‘ much help in this matter, unfortunately, and SG is too bur-
dened with what it considers conflicting responsibilities to
take the strong stand. ,

Students and others who feel’ onlythe burden of the
high cost of education can and are seeing the ﬁrm stand as

A the best. Such ﬁrmness is a battle, but a battle worth wag-
ing. The petitions and the opportunity to speak to Council
‘should be‘ used to their fullest extent.

Racial discrimination has been the subject of
much debate lately on the campus. Freda Kellams,
in an article appearing in the Pitt News M03010,
demanded to know why prejudice was not being
more vigorously attacked at Pitt.
Her article was challenging
enough to evoke two additional
articles and one letuer to the edi-
tor dealing with the same sub-
ject. '

In the recent campaign for
‘elections to student government,‘
both presidential candidates de-
clared they were in favor of see-

 

nate discrimination. It didn't
take a very astute observer to . ‘
notice that what one candidate wasiadvocating dif-

— fered littleif at all from what _the other advo-

cated. Both policies were equallykas insubstantial

and vague.

During the last few weeks then, the topic of
racial discrimination has received an unusual
amount of attention. Unfortunately, however, the
discussion has been for the most part no more
concrete than the policies advocated by the SG
candidates. ’ ’

Begin with Statement _

Yet, on February 13', prior to the appearance of
"Miss Kellams’ article, the University of Pittsburgh
released, through the office of Chancellor Litchﬁeld,

a" policy statement on discrimination.

The paper does announce Pitt’s “opposition to
policies whichgtend to deprive any individual of a
right or privilege, solely because of his race, reli-
gion or national origin.” For taking this stand pub-
licly theladministratio"n is to be commended. These
words, however, while welcome, are not adequate.

One wonders why the original resolution sub-
mitted by the School of Medicine,,,'which would

i The University’s role in Pittsburgh life is constant-

' induced the University to take a stronger stand is

have made it University policy to forbid official
University meetings in private town and country
clubs which practice ‘discrimination was not adopt-
ed.

As Councilman James A. Jordan was quoted in

the Feb. 23 edition of The Pittsburgh Courier, .

“The University of Pittsburgh, in a statement by.

  

/75 '.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld, has failed to meet the test‘)

and take a strong stand against discrimination and
segregation.” Councilman Jordan’s opinion is worth
considering, not only because he is the man about
whom the controversy has resolved, but because he
is one of the leading spokesmen for the Negro
community in Pittsburgh.

. The policy would have been so much more ef-
fective if the University, instead of leaving it up
to the individual schools to decide for themselves,
has declared that it was the University of Pitts-

burgh’s policy not to‘ patronize private clubs which?

discriminate ‘in policy or practice. Such boycotts
are often instrumental in bringing about changes
in policy on the part of the boycotted institutions.
Communify A Looks

In addition,‘there is another factor to ‘consider.

ly growing. Just ‘as the Pittsburgh community is
bound to look towards the clergy for moral guid-
ance in matters such as disc-rimination, so will the
members of this community look to the University
of Pittsburgh, because it is the area’s educational.
center. _ T ‘

It isn’t necessary, however, to evengconsider
the inﬂuence of the University’s policies outside of
the campus. A third factor, which shouldihave

the effect any policy on discrimination is bound to
have on the students. How can the administration
criticize discriminationamong"the students when
it refuses to outlaw the patronization for Univer-
sity functions of private clubs which, practice dis-
crimination? - i \

New SC’ Officers

.Want Student Support

Editor, The Pitt News:

The new Student Government
will soon, take ofﬁce. It is our
intention to continue the capable
leadership exhibit-ed in the past
year. It is also our intention to
provide a better means of com-
‘munication between the student
and his Student Government. ,

Groups such as the Liberal
Arts Cabinet, the Health Ser-
vice Committee, when made
known to the students, can be
more fully utilized.

Furthermore, we hope that
students will bring any ques-
tions, problems, and ideas to us,

so that we might have better‘

knowledge of student.'needs.
They are welcome to attend
meetings and to address the
Senate. ' i
We shall keep the new Stu-
dent Government strong and
vigorous,'but students must re-
member that it is their Student
Government, and it will succeed
or falter — depending on their

support. Together, we shall have

a most proﬁtable year.

African Student Adds

Thoughts on Preiudice

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have reason to believe that
I am the African student who
supposedly gave Ed Ploch “a
dirty look with the energy of
an x—ray for no apparent rea-

son other than the color of my ,

skin.” (Mosaic, Feb. 25).
Putting aside whatever illogi-

eal»analysis'Ed used to arrive at.’
clusion,, may I__

   

this absurd c,

  

suggest.one thing to him and
those who feel concerned.

Just as energy is ‘put into an..

X-ray so that it may give the

edly “dirty. look”; except that,
whereas an X-ray "derives its
energy from an electric genera-

_ tor, that of the African student

is supplied by the initial hate of

Ed’s and his own white race.
Part of Ed’s fatherly advice is

“Don’t ﬁght hatred with hatred.”

Apparently, asia member of"
so-called Iwhite «race, Ed,

the
realizes that hate is bad, and
does not want to be hated in
return for the hate which he
and his race have created.
Would it not be more logical
for‘ Ed and his lot to stop hating,
so that they may not be hated
in return, then to virtuously ad-
vise the hated“ not to take_ re-
venge? - ‘
So long as Ed and his race
continue to hate the so-called
Negro, I see no logical reason
why’, the Negro himself should
not hate in self defense. More-

over, a man who does not hate

when he “should, has no right

\ to love when he is able. /

If it is hatred in self defense
by the Negro ._that serves the

good purpose of reminding Ed‘

and others of the mental and
physical miseries that hate
leaves along its trail, then every
Negro should set" apart, some-
where in his being, a zone of
hate —— healthy, virile hate — for
what the white_ personiﬁes and
for what persists in the white.
To do otherwise would be a
betrayal of the raped
lynched, the tortured and un-
justly executed, the miserable
and the dying. — ,

a Spring of Our Discontent

Trimes’rer Gamble

  

--

0 dent

The fourth year of the trimester system
is almost over, and there is much
discontent.

_ Student Government is examining it
from the student angle;
the questionnaires now 
circulating will add stu-
criticism to‘ the
comprehensive internal
study the committee has
made of areas, from
course offerings to the
degree of activity of
campus ‘organizations.
Even the administration
has recognized the
value of this study and
has offered their computers to compile the

 

5-r‘ -eginformation, thus putting the whole oper-

ation on a more professional and impres-
sive scale. This information willithen. also
be available to the University. There are
over-all results, that they are studying,
emenating from a system and becoming a
permanent defect if concerted action is not
taken by student groups toikeep alive dur-
ing the spring months, or, after this study
is presented to the administration, some
adjustments in this area are not made.
‘Then the ﬁgures themselves appear. At
this date, though still two weeks before
the ﬁnal registration deadline, and the late
registration still to go, almost 1,000 less
students have registered for the term than
the ﬁnal ﬁgures last year. Even though
the Office of Student Records reports a
tendency to register late for spring because
of »last—minute,changes in summer or aca-
demic plans, optimism is not high for this»
much of a jump in the next couple weeks.

 -r-'l’ush the Cycle

The students are not registering. Many
do notbecause of the choice of courses or
professors. The_time schedule is barevof
both in quality and quantity in comparison
to the winter and fall. If you push this
cycle back even further you ﬁnd reasons.
There are fewer courses because there are
fewer teachers. There are fewer taachers,

' ﬁrst, because the administration has limit-

ed them to ﬁve trimesters at a stretch,_
and secondly—an overlooked and import-

ant point-——because there is a decrease in

salary during the term, as stated in the

original trimester proposal.

A front page story in the November 14,
1958 issue of The Pitt News stated the

« scale for this third term as “one third of

the basic nine ‘month salary.” In other
words,_ if the teachers were contracted
for nine-months, they are paid for the full '
school session even though the time ele-

'4“ irment is less. Butethe third trimester’s pay

is not equal to that of the other two. The

work is the same. The hours are the same.
The students are paying the same tuition.
And the teachers are getting less money.

There is a fallacy here — a serious fal-
lacy that typifies a “vicious cycle.” The
campus isn’t active because the students
aren’t here. The students don’t come,.be-
cause the opportunities of the spring tri-
mester are not equal to those of the other
two trimesters. The course and teacher
selection is poor because the teachers are
not here. And the teachers aren’t,here be-
cause, in many cases, they can’t ‘afford to
come.  r

The good teachers don’t come. There
isI_1’t any selection for the students. The
students don’t come, and on, ad nauseum.

Editor Millard Amdur said, in his editor-
ial that November 14, “The problems of
faculty members still remain in the new
report. It continues to be most illogical
that a faculty member makes an increase
of only one-third in salary for teaching
the third trimester . . .

_“We have seen no mention of funds C

available for increased numbers of faculty
members using the third trimester for re-
search.” i

I ‘ This was four years ago. The problem

‘has. not'bee'n solved and it’s snowballing.

The University’s reasoning. may be logi-
‘cal e the teachers may not carry the re-
search or advising -responsibilities that they
do in the other two terms andthey may
not have as many classes to teach.
Fizzle Remains _ V ‘ ,:

But the fact remains. And this ﬁzzle of

the third trimester is not only giving the _

two-and two-third—year-students one year
of University education of lesser intensity
and quality .of curricular and co-curricular
life, but it is detracting from the force of

the other two terms. And for this year A

they pay the same tuition. .

The problem from the administration’s
standpoint ‘is ﬁnancial and realistic. Even
with the raise intuition, this income needs
considerable support from state funds to
pay the teachers’, salaries. A

But with the trimester system it is not

a question of months, but of a new term,
of planning and grading equal «in work
and tension to the fall and winter terms.
According to a faculty member, this dis-
content has been voiced and nothing has
been done.

‘The trimester system was a gamble. If
you take a gamble you may have to invest
a little more to make sure you don’t lose.
The spring term has not caught on.‘I sug-
gest this “vicious cycle” as a strong factor
and perhaps a green rather than a brass

ring is the aim for getting off.

I feel rather sorry for Tom Olofson, and
I believe that a lot of people feel rather
sorry for him. Last Wednesday he was
named the ODK Man of the Year and he
made the featured
speech at the annual .
Tap Day dinner. It may V
seem strange to pity a '
man so nobly honored, 
but he said a number of 5
things in his Tap Day '

address which elicited .
my sympathy and I
don’t see how they

could have failed to do
the same with others.

Olofson tried to prove , .
that a number of misconceptions about the
administration exist at this University, but
all he really managed to prove was that
the administration "has been able to pull
the wool ‘completely over his eyes.

He listed,twe1ve projects which Student
Government activated this year and tried
to show the support which the administra-
tion has given to him in carrying out these
projects.

What he failed to do, however, was to
show the clear distinction between the, re-
sults which were achieved and those which
might have occurred if the administration
and the trustees had fully considered‘ stu-
dent ideas and problems.

Disappointing Results

Sure, graduate students will be allowed
to drink at certain controlled‘ University
functions and, by stretching the laws a
little, people over twenty-one will be _ex-
tended the same privilege in fraternity
houses. But, compared with what might
have been, the results are rather
disappointing, ' '

~ Yet, Olofson seemed satisﬁed, He al-
luded to the administrative decision as a
deﬁnite step forward in a liberal direction.
A step it was, yet you and I and Tom
Olofson still can’t drink on campus.

Another of. the SG sponsored projects
was directed toward the alleviation of the
Oakland parking problem. However, when
SG entered into the fray it found that it
was faced with a problem beset by an-
other problem in the form of the pro-
posed parking meter additions. SG was
naturally disturbed andthe administration
immediately jumped to their support.

Thesupport was devastating and Olof-
son found himself backing an administra-
tion formulated program for cheaper rates
and longer hours —— but the meters were
approved. The phrase: “The era of free

 

parking is over” became -the byword‘ of  
and of Olofson‘, 

SG, the administration,
himself.

Yet, Olofson seems satisﬁed. He sees
the administration standing behind SG and

the student body as they cry into the same _

towel. But the ﬁngers of the administra-
tion are all crossed. The administration‘ is

trying to cover up for a parking program,

  

that is completely inadequate and will not  

be adequate for many years.

Also, the University has had its prob— V
lems with the City and concessions at the _,
expense of the student body are a per- 0‘ 
fect way of appeasing a formidable foe to _i L‘

Oakland domination.

Another ‘problem arose when Frank 

Carver brought up his plan for ﬁve dol-
lar identiﬁcation cards to'be used at ath-
letic events on campus. Carver stressed
the need to prevent non-University stu-
dents from using the facilities that regis-

tered students pay for in tuition and fees. .0 I I

Olofson, with a sincere concern for stu-
dent pocketbooks, suggested that SG pro-
vide the ID cards to the students, but only

at one dollar apiece. The administration ; ‘ 

balked. Once again, SG’s lofty plans did

not receive the needed stamp of approval -

from the Administration. - . 

Olofson gave the student body this re-

prieve from, ﬁve dollar ID cards, yet he "i

does not seem to realize why his proposa

has not been put into effect. c  

Actually Clogging

What this all amounts to is that the ad-
ministration, while seeming to back the 

students, is actually clogging every serious
SG sponsored attempt to produce decisive
1‘esults.- '

Yet, Olofson seems satisﬁed. To a large
extent, the reason for his satisfaction must

be traced to SG’s lack of contact with the‘.  I

administration before Olofson took over
the SG presidency. '

He. does not seem to realize what real i ‘I I I’
victory is. He has been content with the"

few crumbs which the administration has
seen ﬁt to toss his way during the year.
In those areas where nothing was at stake

of great importance, such as‘t_he -Student ’

Directory, new Lib1'ary hours, and the for-

mation of the LA Cabinet, he has received‘

acquiescence. ‘

But there still remain other areas where,
with a smile and a helping hand, the ad-
ministration has done its best to cripple
his efforts. Olofson has caught the smile
and the helping hand but he has stumbled
over the outstretched foot without ever
realizing ‘it was there.

Based Upon Speech Therapy Research

Prof Produces Color Filth

By IVIARCIA BERNSTEIN .

Dr. George Shames, Associ-
ate Professor of Speech and
Psychology, has gone one step
beyond the University expan-
sion-wise by d elvin g into
the ﬁeld of ﬁlm production.

‘The fruit of his labor is a 50-
minute color film based on 24
months of research in speech
therapy done at the Central In-
stitute for the Deaf in St. Louis.

Undergraduate Introduction

As an undergraduate at the
University, Dr. Shames became
impressed with the relationship
between psychology and speech

pathology and audiology. A psy-

chology major, , he “decided to
take a few courses with Dr. Jack
1\_/Ivatthews, chairman of the Speech
Department, and became interest-
ed in communication problems.”

From this undergraduate be-
ginning, Dr. Shames worked his
way up through University

' ranks. He received his Master
of Science and Ph.D. degrees
here, going’ on to become ﬁrst
an’ instructor and ﬁnally an as-
sociate professor of Speech and
Psychology. He is also director
of the Speech Clinic.

At the University, Dr. Shames’
work involves ,“chi1dren
adults who have communication
problems. For the most part my
activities are of a clinical nature,”
he commented, “although ‘I do
teach and do research,

.“At CID -I was involved in, pure
research activities. It was more
for 'the_ purpose of studying
problems.

“As a result of two years at
CID where I was working in a
behaviorallaboratory and par-
ticipating in operant condition-
ing studies and, at the same
time, observing and participat-
ing in clinical programs for‘
children having language dis-
orders,” Dr. Shames explained,
“the job I set for myself was to
bring these two activities to-
gether so that the principles of
conditioning could be applied to
clinical techniques for language
problems.

“Stemming from this experience,
I come away with the feeling that
the principles of operant behavior
may provide a much needed un-
derlying cohesive theme for

goal is to apply the principles of
learning to a number of aspects of

addition to language.”
Operant Behavior

Operant behavior as defined by
Dr. Shames is “behavior whose
appearance depends on the person
perceiving its consequences.
Things that happen after some-
one does or says something plays
a role in the future appearance of
these "actions of words.”

Dr.'_ Shames further clariﬁed
this by ‘giving an example. He
noted that “if I talk and you
listen, I will probably ‘continue
to talk. If you don't. listen,,I
'will stop talking. The consequ-

“That particular kind of con-
ditioning,” Dr. Shames later ob-
served, “may explain a lot about
communication behavior.”

Signiﬁcant Two Years

“I think that the two years,
September 1960 to September
1962, at CID extended signiﬁcant
developing direction and deﬁni-
tion for my research as well as
my teaching. I am really quite en-
thusiastic about the possibilities
of developing some sound prin-

' ciples for our ﬁeld.

“It has proven to be a very
rewarding kind of work,” he con-
cluded, “when I see changes in
chi1dre_n and adult.s_as'a'result of

’, improved communication skills. It

can completely change the goals,
aspirations, and self images of
people.”

THE NEW DEAN of Columbia

of the private liberal arts college
in the -transmission of culture to
a new generation as “an enter-

prise surpassing in importance
any other in the educational
world.”

 student and general affairs.

‘; (See Column, Page Five)

fdispeaking on Student Lead-
ership at the Tap Day Dinner
last Wednesday evening, Stu-
dent Government President
Tom W. Olofson stressed the
inter-relationship of adminis-

tration, faculty, and student body
‘necessary for the University’s
_-growth and prosperity.

_ Olofson‘s speech was composed

‘of six main points, the first being
“that a colleague type relation-
ship_ should exist. between the
-leaders of the three consistent
sectors of the University as the
i_nstitution is actually dependent
upon the contributions of these
-groups and only through a close
working relationship, permeated
with mutual respect, can the ﬁnest
"contributions be made.”

Functions of Parts

The function of each constitu-
ent _part of the University was
outlined by Olofson. “The ad-
ministrative‘ function,” Olofson
explained, “is presently perhaps
the most obvious to the eye due
to the magnitude of the tangible
results it is so. rapidly achieving.”
; But he added, “Physical improve-
ments must not completely over-
lshadow administrative responsi-
.. bilities in faculty, student, and
- curriculum areas.”

The primary function of the
faculty involves “aiding the
student in absorbing knowl-
edge, of inspiring true academic
attainment, and of creating an
‘atmosphere of intellectual curi-
osity and enlightenment.”

A Inregard to the student’s role
_ L at the University, Olofson’s chief

concern was that extracurricular
activities should be “closely as-
V sociated with the academic
sphere.”

 

 

Setting Goal

Olofson’s second main point
concerned the setting of goals by

» a student leader for his organiza-
; tion. He explained that “the ob-
jectives set must be both reason-
able—that is attainable——and ex-

TAP DAY SPEAKER, Tom Olofson, is seen here with Joe Seiger,

tremely challenging.” He went on
to say that “it is the task of the
leader to differentiate between the
attainable and the impossible.”
Goals must contribute -positively
to the organization and the Uni-
versity.

Olofson feels that most stu-
dent leadership fails at this
stage because the student ﬁnds
it difficult to put organizational
goals above personal desires so
essential to the basic requisites
of “fundamental abilities in sys-
tematic problem solving and de-
cision making carried out with-
in a serious frame. of mind."

Point number three was “that
for the student to receive a truly
educational experience from his
activities a minimum amount _of
faculty and administrative advi-
sory assistance is in order.”

Fault is With Student

Olofson expressed his view that
the “realfault lies with the stu-
dent for permitting this situation
to arise,” and backed it up with
a quote from Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld concerning an aspect of
football coaching this year, “The
boys must learn to be leaders on
their own and not to ‘rely on the
coach’s judgment all the time.
This is one of the aims of our
educational system.”

The spirit of co-operation in
-student-administration relation-
ships was 0lfson’s fourth point.
He refuted at length a number
of “falacious” student opinions.

Quoting from a Tap Day speech
delivered by Harry “Woody” Tur-
ner, March 8, 1961, he refuted the
argument that ‘A student can
almost be assured that any ideas
he wished to put into effect, any
hope to change existing condi-
tions, will be squelched through
one means or another . . . ‘The
administration is not concerned
with faculty or students’ opinions
. . . ‘The administration does not
even regard its students as capa-
ble of holding opinions.’

office working harmoniously with
the senators to bring about their
success. Olofson stated, “on no
single occasion have I, as Student
Government president, been in-
volved in a conﬂict brought on by
an administrative desire to squelch
students’ ideas or initiative.”
Point ﬁve was that “the po-
tential of the University’s total
offerings is great and that is
almost entirely dependent upon
the student’s own initiative to
exploit this area.” Olofson con-
ceded, however, that student
organizations could contribute
more by “increasing the actual
worth content of their activities
and applying more critical
thinking . . . to delete insig-
niﬁcant worthless endeavors and
concentrate upon the bringing
about of new activities offering
educational v‘alues.’,’

Refuting, the “false impression
that if there is something. worth-
while, the trimester does not al-
low one time to fully exploit it,”
Olofson made his last point that
“the trimester and its increased
demands are actually in step with
society ‘in general and it only
cuts down on one’s free. time
schedule if the individual chooses
to retain antiquated standards.”

SKIPPING ABOUT

Temper outbursts in intramural basketball games/are not
unique‘ to this locale. They happen everywhere, judging
from ringside reports from other college newspapers.

One of the best outbreaks occurred recently in a game
between the Phi Eps and ZBTS in the Class A ‘Fraternity
League at American University. 250 fans watched a wild
game, spiced with several midcourt feuds. »

The height of excitement came in, the waning
moments when referee Willy’ Jones, former American
University Little All-America, lost control of himself-
after being constantly needled by members of the Phi

, Ep club about hiscalls.

Jones relieved his anxieties by throwing a series of wild
punches that grazed‘ a couple of Phi 'Eps. Athletic'Director
Dave Carrasco restrained the ﬁrey, 5-foot—10'referee, who
went on to ﬁnish the game after he gained his composure

behind closed doors.

Many Factors
Created For

Hoop Success

By ART FLEISCHNER

Many factors combined this
year to give Pitt its first tour-
nament team and best basket-
ball record in five years. The
most important was Dave
Roman, a junior transfer
from-~Johnstown College. '

Roman gave the Panthers their
best /outside shooter since Don
Hennon. The flashy backcourt
star immediately caught the at-
tcntion of local hoop followers
with his behind the back dribbling‘
and spurts oi’ 20-foot jump shots.
-—Although he only had _a 14.8
overall average, Roman led the

-Panthers in scoring. He did most

of his point-making in the second
half of the season, leading the
team in scoring live. of the last ten
games.
Defense Dominates

A second factor in the Panthers’
success this season was the stress-
ing of defensive play. Coach Bob

Timmons continually worked on ~

this, saying, “l\/lost of the team
knows how to shoot; it’s their de-
fense that they have to work on.”
This the Panthers did and
ended the regular season with
a 62.5 defensive average. “We
help one another out on de-
fense,” said Dave Saucr, “That's
why Paul Kricger draws so
many fouls, because he's always
picking up the loose man com-
ing down the lane.”

Another aspect of this year’s
success is the scoring average of
the individual players. Five end-
ed the season averaging; double
ﬁgures. At one time or another
-during the campaign, six clifferent
men led the team in scoring.

The lone player who graduates,
Ben Jinks; had his best season.
While averaging 11 points a game,

.Jinks played outstanding on de-

fense. His improved play over last
year can not be overlooked in
giving Pitt a 19-6 record and a
berth in the NCAA tournament.

M Dental Juniors Edge All—Stars

To Capture Intramral Cro

, )1

Upperclassnien
Win Close Game

At Field House

By JIIVI 0’l?-RIEN

The intramural basketball
championship s h o u l d have

been played in one“ of those

circular h o s p ital theatres
where students sit in the sur-
rounding balcony and scrutin-
ize the operation.

About 45 white-[rocked fans
watched the ﬁnale he_re last Wed-
nesday in Fitzgerald Field House
as the Dental Juniors maintained
their upperclass supremacy over
the Dental All-Stars, a frosh club,
by the score of 40-39. V

The combatants would have en-
joyed playing in a circular theatre,
too, for the Field House ﬂoor was
three times the length of their
normal playing ﬂoor.

Rally Here

The IM champions had to rally
from a 29-22 third—quarter deﬁcit
to claim the crown: They were
outscored, 10-5, in that almost dis-
astrous period. '

The Juniors were down, 31-
25, at the outset of the last per-
iod when Don Davis, their big
boardman, hit a short jump
shot. Little Joe DeBlasio fol-
lowed with another jumper and
the Juniors were within two
points.

Sykes Reed tied the game with
5:50 remaining to play at 31-31,
and Davis followed with another
ﬁeld goal to push the Juniors to a
33-31 advantage. DeBlasio hit a
free throw and a driving layup in
the next minute to give his club a

"solid 36-31 edge.

Shutout Losers

In the first four minutes of the
ﬁnal eight-minute . period, the
Juniors outscored theirfoes, 11-0.
The All-Stars were forcing the
ball here and continually losing
possession. '

With less than two minutes
remaining, the Juniors led, 40-
35. Then Byron Justice of the
All—Stars picked up’ his ﬁfth
personal foul with 1:41 left.
This hurt his team badly for he
had kept them in the game,
scoring all ten of his points in
the second half.

Clint Logan missed a vital free
throw here for the All—Stars. Then
footballer John Chisdak and
Logan streaked for two quick lay-
ups, the last_ score just before the
buzer, but the All-Stars were shy
a point. -

Ranc Stopped

Miles Ranc, who had been scor- - '

ing 17.7_ ppg. for the All-Stars, hit
eight points .:;in the lead-off half,
but only scored one point after the

intermission, and except for Jus- .

tice, the freshmen could not score.

With 15 seconds"remaining' to
play, Reed threw a glancing

Maugham’s ‘Rain’

To Be Produced

The major production of the

University Theater during the
spring trimester will be “Rain”,
adapted by John Colton and
Clemence Randolph from the
short story of W. Somerset Maug-
ham, originally titled “The Trem-
bling Leaf.”
T The play will run from June
'11 through 15 in Stephen Foster
Memorial. Bernard Engel will di-
rec]: and Philip R. Eck will de-
gign theproduction.

 

.1 The "play uses the interelations

between a zealous missionary and
a prostitute to deliver a cynical

- _ eomment on man's ideals.

' Readings for the play will be
held this trimester April 11 and
12, and in the first weeks of the
Spring trimester. ‘

-, Following its initial production,
Ludwig Lewisohn wrote in The
Nation: “Rain . . . is one of the
most notable plays of this or any

' other season. It is morally pro-

found and dramaturgically bril-
lant.”
