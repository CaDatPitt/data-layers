Bush slight on regrets

in final televised address

President George W Bush

-delivered his ﬁnal televised ad— I

dress last night, outlining the
successes and even hinting at
some mistakes of his eight—year
presidency — a presidency that
will be remembered for leav-
ing the United States in one of
the most tumultuous periods of
economic and international in-
stability in recent history.

Bush spent most of the ad—
dress defending his foreign
policy record, emphasizing the
importance of his anti—terrorist
and national security efforts fol-
lowing the Sept. 11 attacks. He
praised Afghanistan as a “young
democracy” and Iraq as an “Arab
democracy. in the heart of the
Middle East and a friend to the
United States.”

For a president currently
plagued by‘ one of the worst
economies in the last century,
two wars and a 34 percent ap-
proval rating, Bush was sur-
prisingly short on regrets last
night, only stating that though
there were things he would have
“done differently if given the
chance,” he “always acted with
the best interests of our country
in mind.”

Bush’s persistent defense of
his administration was not sur-
prising. The president has always
prided himself on his.abi_lity to
make decisions and stick with
them, asserting last night that
though many may disagree with
his decisions, “they can agree,
that he was able to make the
tough decisions.” ’

This one statement might
have been one of the most tell-
ing remarks from Bush’s farewell
address. _ - '

Throughout his tenure, Bush

has made and stuck by decisions
that have had far-reaching effects
for both U.S. and foreign citizens
— even after it became clear that
some of these decisions were
made with faulty intelligence and
poor planning.

Though it is important for a
president to stand by his deci-
sions, Bush’s unwavering posi-

tions on Iraq, interrogation,

education and the environment

ultimately exposed a leader who
was unable to make thoughtful
decisions or reflect on changing
intelligence, international devel-
opments and public opinion.

For someone who claims to
act with the American public’s
interest in mind, Bush has con-
sistently displayed little regard
for the opinions of the Ameri-
can public. '

Throughout Bush’s address, it
became difﬁcult to tell whether
the president’s ardent defense
rose from an ongoing belief in
his decisions and record, or from
a last-ditch effort at preserving
his legacy. Whatever his motiva-
tions, Bush is clearly leaving the
White House-with few regrets.

Whether these reﬂections
change m the years to come, his
current unwillingness to accept
defeat suggests a certain imma-
turity in Bush. '

A strong leader would be
capable of acknowledging his
mistakes and insecurities,‘ reﬂect

on what he might have done dif-

ferently and speak humbly of his

. faults. '

We hope in the months and
years to come, the country will
rebound and recover from the
last eight years and move toward
a future of economic prosperity
and global tolerance. A

Pittsburgh's steel town heritage
catalyst for celebratory riots

    

Colum/2121!

 
 

More than any allegiance I have
to the black and gold, I am rooting
for a Steelers—Eagles Super Bowl.
I grew up ir1 south-central Penn-
sylvania, but make no mistake, it
is not the geography of my origin
that encourages me to pray for the
matchup rather than the home
team’s victory. It is because I want
to see a magniﬁcent, fall-of—Rome-
decadent riot. ~

The pinnacle of civil disobedi-
ence that was the Steelers riot in
’06 was unforgettable and will be
likely what ﬂashes before my eyes
whenimy life is ﬁnally spent. A ju-
venile, l9-year-old version of my-
self wandered starry—eyed through
an Oakland that was post-apoc-
alyptic with joy. I sawa ﬁreman

tending to a couch blaze only to ’

have his visor yanked up by an in-
toxicated co—ed, the two of whom

then proceeded to make out with '

each other. It was beautiful.
If the Steelers meet the Eagles

in the Super Bowl, I have no doubt I

that the public display that ensues,
regardless of outcome, will effort-
lessly eclipse the events of Feb. 5,
2006. While Pittsburgh is through
and through a Steelers town, Oak-

land ﬁnds itself a house divided, ‘

suffused with the Philly fandom
of students from the East.

When the fourth quarter ends,
the streets of our quaint campus
will be set alive with sectarian vio-
lence, the likes of which I can only
conceive in “Gangs of New Yor ”
imagery. if

I foresee a wave of black crash-
ing with a wave of green and the
rest is in slow motion. 1, for one,
cannot wait.

_ However, - drunk on such
dreams, I begin to wonder, “Why
is Pittsburgh so very inclined to
rioting.” The Steelers, West Vir-
ginia games, President—elect Ba-
rack Obama —— it seems like the
city needs very little provocation
to send itself into marches, chants,

car ﬂipping and indecent expo’-
sure.

The answer might be as simple.

as, “We have a lot of college stu-
dents and a lot of bars.” The con-
vergence of these twain is gener-
ally disorderly conduct. However,
a lot of cities have alcohol and
young adults. What makes Pitts-
burgh special? H

I suggest that the catalyst for
the steel city’s aping of L.A. is its
anachronistic workman’s spirit.
When Pittsburgh was thriving un-
der the sooty cloud of its mills and
the Steelers were a young team, a
ﬁerce bond between the workers

and the team was forged. Pitts- ,

burgh sports became a source
of diversion for the labor—weary
populace. Before long, the Steel-
ers were the lifeblood of the town.
You all know the story.
Pittsburgh, though, is no lon-

 

Pittsburgh, though, is

no longer such a city.

The town marches to
the beat of UPMC

._ rather than Carnegie

Steel.

 

ger such a city. The town matches
to the beat of UPMC rather than
Carnegie Steel.

As much as native Pittsburghers
like to see themselves as munch-
ing Primanti’s on an I-beam, the
sobering reality is that most are
probably wearing scrubs or sitting
in lecture halls. Sure, Pittsburgh
still has a vibrant and admirable
blue-collar demographic, but it’s
no longer a majority presence.

So, why do we still cling to pro-
letariat holdovers like rioting? It’s

all part of the narrative. Whereas‘

some cities have distinguishing
landmarks or unrivaled artistic
offerings, Pittsburgh —— for all

its beauty and success in the aca-
demic and medical ﬁelds —— sets
itself apart by being the little in-

dustrial town that could. “Yeah, I

Pittsburgh. That city where folks
are tough as nails, living out the
spirit of ol’ Joe Magarac. But, boy,
you should see what they are do-
ing with hospitals.”

To make sure we do not lose
our workrnan’s credentials, we li-
onize rough—and-tumble behavior.

Rioting just happens to fall in the _

serendipitous halfway point be-
tween blue—collar toughness and
collegiate merriment. Through the
Darwinian bestiality of rioting we
can continually reinvent ourselves
as a city where only the strong sur-
vive, even if, by all other accounts,

i we are a pre-eminently livable city.

Fortunately for rioting, there
is an element of fun to our public
displays. ’

In riots, Pittsburgh appears
as the best of two worlds: hard
as steel but brimming over with
amusement.

_Some might worry that this
whole charade stiﬂes progress.
By rnirning an antique spirit, we
stymie the growth of a new Pitts-
burgh.

How can we ever scramble to
the top of magazine rankings if
we suffer the stigma of a sooty,
raucous city?

Such fears are unfounded. Like
any kitsch, Pittsburgh’s throw-
back, blue-collar spirit is far more
decorative than it is deﬁnitive, and,
therefore, thoroughly benign.

Furthermore, talk of “authen-
tic” culture is almost always mis-
guided and rhetorical.

Culture is largely an affected
behavior: the product of how a
community views itself and how
they are unfairly stereotyped. “Real
culture” is just a buzz-phrase by
way of which an individual .can
elevate the aspects of a culture he
enjoys.

Therefore, carry on my friends.
Be the riot you wish to see and sa-
vor the beautiful disorder of it all.

Unbeaten Panthers face tough foes

by Alex Oltmanns '
Staﬂ W/rite/'

After two straight games
against teams projected to ﬁnish
near the bottom of the Big East,
the Pitt men’s basketball team pre-
pares to take on two top—20 teams
in three days.

The top-ranked Panthers
(16—(), 4-0 Big East) travel to Ken-
tucky to take on the No. 20 Louis-
ville Cardinals (12—3, 3-0 Big East)
Saturday at 6 p.m. and then return
home to host the No.- 8 Syracuse

‘Orange (16—2, 4-1 Big East) Mon-

day at‘ 7 p.m.

These might be two of the
most athletic teams that Pitt will
face all season, as both programs
continually lure some of the best
high school talent year after year.

Similar to Pitt’s “Big Three” of
Sam Young, Dejuan Blair and Le-
vance Fields, Louisville boasts its
own intimidating trio.

Forward freshman sensation

Samardo Samuels has burst onto
the collegiate scene, averaging
nearly 13.9 points and 6.1 re-
bounds per game in his first 15
contests.

Meanwhile, forwards Earl
Clark and Terrence Williams have
been mainstays on the Cardinals’
front line all season, averaging
13.8 and 12.3 points per game, re-
spectively.

Williams is coming off his
best outing of the season in an
87-73 overtime win against Notre
Dame, where he nearly achieved
a triple—double. Williams ﬁnished
with 24 points and 16 rebounds
while dishing out eight assists.

Meanwhile, lSyracuse’s major
production doesn’t come from
just three players, but from five, as
the entire starting lineup averages
in double figures in scoring.

The team is led by two dynam-
ic and multidimensional players
in sophomore guard Jonny Flynn

and junior forward Paul Harris.
Flynn frustrates defenses in mul-
tiple ways, averaging 16.3 points
and 5.7 assists per game. Harris
complements Flynn, scoring at a
clip of 13.8 points per game.

The Orange came into this sea-
son looking to make a statement,
as they got guards Eric Deven—
dorf and Andy Rautins back after

_ both missed most of last season

with devastating injuries.

In order for the Panthers to
come out of these two games un-
scathed, their fate will rest heavily
on their guards, namely Fields.

Louisville takes advantage of
its athleticism to continually em-
ploy a stingy full—court press, while
Syracuse will likely use a 2-3 zone
defense that has been a staple of
coach Jim Boeheim’s teams for
decades.

Pitt needs Fields to.live up to
his nickname of “The General”
to run the offense well by making

smart decisions against Louisville’s
press and moving the ball around
to find the soft spot in Syracuse’s
zone.

Fields ran the offense to near
perfection in the team’s 75-62 win
against South Florida Wednesday
In that game, he recorded a dou-
ble-double with 11 points and 13
assists while only committing one
turnover.

Last season, Pitt split two
games against the Cardinals, with
the win coming in the quarterﬁ-
nals of the Big East tournament.

Pitt beat Syracuse 82-77 in the
teams’ only meeting last year. The
Panthers pulled out a dramatic late
second-half comeback, capped
off when Young stole an inbound
pass before passing to Keith Ben-
jamin for the decisive basket.

Yet, the Panthers seemingly
had no answer for Flynn in that
game, as he tied his season—high

» with 28 points.

Pitt helps students find  

roommates and places

' by Kelly Thomas
Shz__ﬁ’ Writer

Renting an apartment for the
first time might seem overwhelm-
ing, but Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Off-Cam-
pus  can help.

The office provides a renters’
guide, a listing of city-inspected
apartments and a roommate
matching service to help students
ﬁnd their perfect living mates.
It also maintains all University-
owned apartments, which are
properties leased to students who
no longer wish to live in dorms.

Kevin Stiles, manager of leas-
ing and support services, said that
the office exists to help students
who want to live off campus.

“We provide educational ma-

Stiles said students can come
into the office and have someone
answer their questions.

ments and make appointments
with the help of office staff.

The renters’ guide, which can
be found on the office’s Web site,
takes students through the basics
of “what they need to know be-
fore renting an apartment.

A description of neighbor-
hoods helps students decide
where in Pittsburgh they’d like to
live, and a chart lets them know
the average cost of renting and
utilities for a single person.

Stiles suggested researching
before signing a lease.

“Educate yourself. Read the
lease and ask questions,” he said
in an e-mail. “Review the infor-
mation online  or stop ir1 our
office for a brochure, other refer-
ence material or advice.”

Put on your pithy helmet for Tower C safari

by Mark Kozlowski

Cola/nmidt

Anthropologists have what many would
consider an interesting job: trotting about
the world observing the unusual customs
and ways of life of those in foreign coun-
tries. They work quite diligently-so that
anthropological ignoramuses such as I get
to ﬂip through the National Geographic
magazine and say, “Bones through the
NOSE? That’s so WEIRD!” forgetting, of
course, that weirdness is relative.

For all I know, wearing denimis a cul-
tural taboo in Borneo akin to eating a dog
in the United States.

For all the feature stories on faraway

places, there seldom are similar stories on
the United States. for local consumption,
especially since National Geographic got
rid of its ZipUSA feature several years
ago. ‘
To redress the balance, I would like to
forward an amateur anthropological report
on an unusual environment: Tower C. And
people in Tower C were wondering what it
was with the pith helmet.

Upon reaching adulthood, a

native of , Tower C is separat-

ed from his tribe at home and

sent to this location as a right
of passage.

The natives of Koniec in Tower C Prov-
ince [note: I have to name it something
other than a speciﬁc ﬂoor  ], are scattered

in a large cylinder, in orderly stacks one ‘

above the other. _

Upon reaching adulthood, a native of

Tower C is separated from his tribe at

,home and sent to this location as a right of

passage. The natives are placed in a trape-
zoidal hut ‘and told to meditate and mature
over the next year.’

It is unclear whether the trapezoidal
rooms have any grounds in their theology
or the decision to pursue engineering.

The larger community is divided into
many sub-tribes. These tribes oddly do not

interact, except for that ritual of Sunday‘

wherein some of the men gather in a des-
ignated location to watch men in colorful
jerseys, anywhere from tens to hundreds
of miles away, rough one another up.

The sub-tribe where I stayed is gov-
erned in a “big man” fashion, where our
chief leads by example, inﬂuence and im-

passioned oratory. He also claims author-
ity from a higher power, which, rather like
the Old Testament, shows up and srnites
people who are especially wicked. This
power is most reliable and was thoroughly
believed in, though I, myself, had not seen
anyone get arrested.

Speaking of smitten, the fair womenfolk
of the province were kept away from the
men. The reason why was unknown, but it

,was theorized that doing so enabled them

to go to the bathroom in groups more ef-

ﬂciently. Occasionally, one would come
among us, causing the natives of Koniec
to ﬂock to whatever room she was in and
behave as if they had not seen a woman in

years.

Aside from looking at women, the tribe
was very community—oriented, and many
activities were communal. It was not un-
usual to have profound conversations in
thevbathroom, for one, which was truly a
meeting place and watering hole.

The huts all faced this bathroom, form-

 

ing a sort of kraal. The doors of the huts
were mostly left open, rather in the fashion
of the Kalahari !Kung tribe prior to about
1960. The similarity to the !Kung was strik-
ing and is a source for further research:
Both the !Kung tribe and the residents of
Koniec are ultimately nomadic.

The traditions of the tribe were quite
colorful, though at times quite loud and
disruptive of other rituals, such as medi-
tation over calculus. One special tradition
took place on a day that’s name means

Some Pitt students take in four—legged roommates

by Alex Russell
For T be Pitt New

Pitt junior Matt Turko owns two pet liz-
ards —— named after his heroes Dan Con-
stantine Marino ]r. and \William Howard
Taft — that live the party life with him and
his other nine roommates. .

“We built a beer pong table for them to
live inside with a glass top so they can see
the party,” said Turko.

Although they can be cute, cuddly and

’ fun to play beer pong with, pets require a

lot_ of attention and sometimes even more

money, especially for cash—strapped stu—'

dents.

Turko, however, assured that it is com-
pletely safe, and they are cared for.

“The only problem is they smell and try
to escape all the time,” said Turko.

Jolene Miklas, a spokesperson for Ani-
mal Friends, an animal shelter based out of
Southwestern Pennsylvania, said that stu-
dents, when buying a pet, often don’t real-
ize how busy they actually are or the costs
involved with maintaining a pet.

Unfortunately it’s not un-
common for students to bring
back animals at the end of the
school year  or even leave them
abandoned at their dorms.

J 0le_1j1e_,

  

“Unfortunately it’s not uncommon for
students to bring back animals at the end
of the school year,” said Miklas, “or even
leave them abandoned at their dorms.

Some Pitt students, however, have em-
braced the responsibilities of owning a pet
and have made the long—term commitment
that animals require.

Pitt senior Andrew Black said that once
he saw W/all—E, his dachshund named af-
ter the robot in the Disney ﬁlm “\X/all—E,”
in the pet store he just had to buy him no
matter the price. _

“He doesn’t cost much per week, he’s
still a puppy,” said Black, “But I’m still pay-
ing off the $1,000 1 charged on my credit
card to buy him.”

Although Black said that buying \X/all—E
was worth the cost, he does admit that a
lot of hard work comes along with having
a pet. .

“I have a hard time training him to do

‘his business outside,” said Black, “and

he likes to chew things up, especially my
homework.” _‘ .
\While Black works toward his degree in

mathematics and statistics, he has bigger
plans for \X/all—E.

“\X/all—E has his own Facebook,” he said,
“He’s wants to network so he can eventu-
ally become a dog model for Purina.”

Pitt student jerra John found herself in
quite a situation last year when her room-
mate’s boyfriend found a dog wandering
around Atwood Street and brought her
home. They put ﬂiers up and put her pic-
ture on Craigslist in hopes of ﬁnding her

A owners.

The owners eventually contacted them
and said that they didn’t want her anymore,
so they decided to take care of her.

“She gets a little crazy, chews up sheets
and stuff,” said john, “but for the most
part, she’s well behaved.”

Dinga, which she was named because
of her dingo-like appearance, has had quite
an impact on the household, said John.

“We lost our one roommate because
she didn’t want to live with a dog,” said
John, However, John said that she’d rather

live with Dinga anyway.

Miklas, a Pitt alumna, said she knows
how busy a student can be just with school-
work and classes alone and remembers she
didn’t have a lot of money to spare.

Things don’t always turn out so well for

‘Pitt students who own dogs, as Pitt student

Meghan Kosar knows quite well.

“My friends had a dog and discovered
that it was too demanding with schoolwork
and everything, so they ended up giving it
to their parents.” _

Hinton lys down the No. l rules forrrenting

by Erik Hinton

C0/u/nmi-/t

New lease season is here, and that means
untold wonders for students. Group after
group of giddy freshmen and jaded up-
perclassmen will pour out into the streets
of Oakland to enter the pool of renters.
They will make their marks on legally bind-
ing documents with all the eagerness of a
new family and all the ingenuousness of
colonial—era American Indians soon to
have their possessions stolen by the Very
contract they ignorantly ratify.

Cell—phone networks will be ﬂooded by
calls to parents — “Mom, $2,000 a month
is cheap right?” —— and Facebook will buzz
with students trying to investigate the rent-
al practices of landlords. However, the best

laid plans of mice and men oft go awry..

Most likely, no matter how much research
you do, you will end up with a lease that
strips you of all civil liberties and forces
you to spin straw into gold.

If my pessimism seems unwarranted,
then you have never known someone who
was charged $100 from their security de:
posit for “cleaning the inside of a dish-

washer.” A dishwasher, by all rights, cleans
itself. In fact, if the dishwasher fails to clean
itself, I have no faith in the ability of the
appliance to perform its eponymous duty.
This is but the tip of the asinine iceberg
that is the ﬂeecing of collegiates through
rental agreements. ,
All is not lost,-though. There are a few
steps that you can take to safeguard your-
self in the leap of faith that is living off
campus. If the following advice comes off
as bitter, good. Hopefully, it will give you a
fair indication of what rental life is like. I,

currently,'have a wonderful landlord, but
it is only by this exception to the rule that
I am assured that only the most meticu-
lous renter will spare himself the pitfalls of
leasee—ship: .

1.) A classic new renter mistake is rent-
ing a house with toilets that have weak
flushes. Likely, you will argue that there are
more important — although, perhaps, rar-
er —'— qualities necessary for a good home
such as structural integrity and a location
distant from gangland. However, walls can
be rebuilt, and most of you will be old

enough to purchase ﬁrearms. No college
student, though, is a good plumber, and
nothing is more demoralizing than a toilet
you have to wrestle to flush. You will lose
friends and be forced to have awkward
conversations with future mates long be-
fore you ever want to havethem. Try all
your bathroom ﬁxtures while_touring, and
trust the flush.

2.) If a landlord promises to put new
carpet down, an air conditioner in, a roof
on the house, etc., make sure that you get
this agreement in writing. If the landlord

Home ownership is,
like, so last century

by Lewis Lehe

Colummiit

 

The U.S. economy is sinking, chained at
the ankles to 10 trillion tons of houses. All
that wood and brick and metal and chemis-
try was a magic plastic with which we could
have built whatever we wanted: factories,
guitars, diplomas, anything.

But we built houses, because the culture
and government were hung over from a
worn—out “Leave It to Beaver” vision: Ev—
eryone had to live in a house, a house that
they owned. Because, after all, renting was
nothing but feudalism. Unless it was public
housing, and then it was communism. Ac-
tually, renting is the future, and free choice
will make it so.

I forecast the United States will become
more urban. Partly this is necessity. But fa-
cility is even more crucial to the trend.

_ Craigslist, for example, makes urban life
10 times easier. On Craigslist, you can find
rooms, roommates, furniture, jobs, parking,
ride shares, events and people with similar
interests. . .

Just think about the case of furniture:
When you need to stock an apartment,
Craigslist is there with hundreds of free
"or cheap furniture pieces, closer and even

. cheaper than IKEA. The furniture might_

even be a veteran Craigslist piece, recycled
two or three times. Craigslist is Mary Pop-
pins’ purse, but without the medicine. It’s a
bottomless Dumpster, but without the cof-
fee grounds. It’s a never—ending curbside,
where every night is the night before trash
day. ‘ .
Craigslist is a jewel in the crown of civi-
lization. I

Plus, we have Google. I can type “op-
tometrist l52l3” and have a map of 12 op-
tometrists, with addresses, directions, num-
bers, hours and even reviews a click away.
It’s how I thought the Web would be when
it first disappointed me as a child.

Google Transit tells you three ways
to anywhere. It collapses the weird Clue
Game of bus schedules and subways into
a single query. And with GPS‘ and portable
Internet becoming common, you can ac-
cess Google Transit pretty much anywhere
— a map, schedule, memory and sense of
direction in one, like having the Rain Man
as your guardian angel.

And when a renter couples Google
Streetview with Craigslist, look out! It’s a
real—time housing catalogue. You can type

-the address from Craigslist into Streetview

and check out the house and the neighbor-
hood. Then you can log onto LandorSlum.
com and see, with surprising accuracy,
which preﬁx applies to your lord.

The Internet is making the world more
like the Internet. And ironically, that’s more
like the world as you natively envision it,
before you get acquainted with its hang-
ups and hassles and delays and awkward-
ness and unexpected expenses piling up on
all sides.

It’s like when you take Econ 101, you
learn about ideal, perfectly competitive
markets, where consumers have perfect
information and there are tons of sellers
competing. Your common sense and your
economics professor ought to tell you right
away those happy graphs are a dream that
we use to build on — the “do re mi” of
economics. But with these new tools, city
life approaches that dream. And it’s rent-
ers who get the closest, with their ﬂexibility
and better bargaining position. ,

What’s more, American culture is al-

landlords at their own game

Hinton, page ll ‘

fails to provide it, make sure they specify
what year this renovation forecast is to go
into effect. Also, demand that the landlord
speciﬁes whether or not a throw rug counts
as replacing carpet and whether for not really
big fans count as air conditioners. If pos-

sible, have your landlord build a tiny, exact’

model of the room that you are supposed
to receive within the actual room. A

3.) Once you have moved .in, take pic-
tures of every - room in detail. Landlords
cannot claim you broke your house if you
can prove that it had been broken long be-A
fore you ever occupied it. However, it will be

unclear if the pictures are all from the same‘

rooms. Therefore, you will want to compile
said pictures into neat panoramas. However,
there will be no way to verify when the pic-
tures were taken. Therefore, you will want to

seal these pictures in a time capsule with the -
date engraved and notarized. Bury this in_

your landlord’s yard and wait for the security
deposit to roll in. i

4.) The second most common way to
lose a security deposit is when your landlord
simply refuses to admit you paid all of your
bills. Even if you have records that prove you
are up to date on rent and any other utilities
your landlord collects, you will be faced with
tough questions such as, “Sure, you paid 12
months of rent, but why do we afford the
number 12 special signiﬁcance?” Naive rent-
ers might think the answer is, “Because this
was a year lease.” However, your landlord
is actually questioning how meaning devel-
ops through the use of language. It will be
necessary to study Wittgenstein if you ever

‘ hope to get your security deposit back.

5.) Finally, it is not unheard of for land-
lords to simply disappear, thus vindicating
them of security deposit responsibility. If
your landlord seems like the skittish type, I
advise that during one of your "encounters

you’ drug your landlord and implant them

with _a discreet GPS beacon. Tagging them
like wild game might be the most effective
and painless way of keeping them honest.

At times, these measures might seem ex-
cessive, but they are only so extreme as to
match the absurd lengths your counterparts
will go to rob you of your parents’ money.
Good luck.

ally are not ﬂexible. A

Paula Sobehart, an administrative assis-
tant at Forbes Management, said that there
have been occasions when tenants moved
from one of the company’s apartments to
another, and Forbes Management allowed
the client to use storage space.

Sobehart said that Forbes Management,
which has H 250 apartments in Oakland,
needs one day in between leases to clean
and paint the apartments, so there is no le-
niency about letting people stay later.

' Gregory Barr, who owns three proper-
ties around Pittsburgh,.agreed with Sobe-
hart.

“We’re pretty easy going, of course. But .

everything has to be legal this day and age,”
he said.

However, he is not opposed to hav-
ing tenants move in a couple days early as

"long as he is done cleaning the place-. Barr

In the summer, he es-
timated that the facility operates at 95 to
98 percent capacity. Scott recommends re-
serving storage spaces in advance.

Pitt junior Deanne Conrad will find her—
self in between leases for the first time this
year.

Most leases begin at the beginning or
end of the month: Conrad’s leaseends on
Aug. 16, and she has not decided if she
wants to pay for two apartments at once

or if she wants to be “homeless” for a few ‘

weeks.

Conrad said she is fortunate to have a
brother at Pitt and plans to stay with him.
She recommends that people ﬁnd a “base”
during the transitional period.

But Wilhelm warned against staying too
long.

“After about four weeks, you tend to 'lay
down some roots,” he said.

Though I never did ask if this was part »

of some religious observance, it appeared
to be so. ~ '

The expression “thank God it’s Friday”
was in common_ use, and the after—effects
of the ceremony appeared so unpleasant as
to be justiﬁed only by immense devotion to
something. The following day saw the na-
ﬁves mostly sequestered in their huts, and
quite surly when coming out of them in the
early afternoon. A

My foreignness became even more pro-
nounced at these times, when bouncing
about in the mornings to complete silence.

For everyone of the sub—tribe, this was
the only life they had ever known.

Some wished to escape it to ﬁnd their
own living quarters in the Elysian Fields of
South Oakland. .

Some wondered if they could return to
the tribein the coming years.

Others were actively pursuing “big man”

status somewhere, either with the claim of
