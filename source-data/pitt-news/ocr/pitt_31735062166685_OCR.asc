Learv EXP011I1dS Ideas Halliday Outlines Structure

About Hallucinogens
At Drug Conference

by NAN ISEN
“You’ve got to turn on, tune in, and drop out,” preach-
ed Dr. Timothy Leary at the Student ‘Association Drug
Conference at Frostburg State College, Frostburg, Md., last

Friday.

In spite of the cold and overcast day, about 1,700 en-
thusiastic people lined the hillside of the campus to hear
Dr. Leary expound his theories on hallucinogenic drugs,
particularly marijuana and LSD.

As the last strains of the Beatle’s album Sargent Pep-
per’s Lonley Hearts Club”Band faded, Dr. Leary dressed in white,
seated himself on an oriental rug and began his “talk.”

Dr. Leary referred to the Beatle’s album as, “The Bible of a.
trip.” The -songs most accurately describe the feeling one experi-
ences under the inﬂuence of hallucinogenci drugs.

In explaining the theory of “turning on,” the former Harvard
professor warned that the use -of drugs is a highly complicated
procedure, involving hard, disciplined work and regular training.
Each sense organ is in itself complicated, and this is the only
method by which one can be activated.

Everyone should not use drugs for this reason. Dr. Leary em-
phasized that it takes at least two years of hard work to be able
to smoke marijuana properly, and only after -thi~s.-initia.1 period
can some select individuals go on to the “graduate schoo ” of LSD.

Further elucidating the principle of being “turned on,” Dr.
Leary, now head of the League for Spiritual Discovery in Millbrook,
N. Y., stated that marijuana is “gentle, harmless, safe, and il-
legal,” but more important, it “makes sense to the conscience.”

The theory of being turn on is
an “internal proposition,” ac-
cording to Dr. Leary: “It is a
physical change in .man’s two
billion year old body, brought
about through an external stim-

* ulus.”

Dr. Leary noted that a hip
person is turned on. He is one
who “does his own thing, with-

out having fear of ‘dropping.

out’ of -society.” Dropping out
of society involves the renounc-
ing of, the “American rob-ut
game,” the drop-ping in on the
body, wisdom, and tribal way
of life, exempliﬁed in Leary’s
wearing of beads an-d a ﬂower
in his graying hair.

When one drops out of so-
ciety one obtains a more inclu-
sive education than he can ob-
tain in school. Dr. Leary refer-
red to the Haight-Ashbury dis-
trict of San Francisco and the
Greenwich area of New York
City as the campuses of this
new education, stating that the
people living in these areas are
like the undergraduates any-
where.

Dr. Leary pointed out that
the use of drugs helps an in-
dividual establish his identity.
He noted that today’s youth
lives in “one of the most inse-
cure societies in history” and
are persecuted and brain wash-
ed by a compulsory education
in which the teachers are the
“drug pushers.”

He noted that we live in a
society of affluence and materi-
al luxury created by our par-
ents due to the depression and
prohibition. Our generation will
not buy this alcoholic, material-
istic culture, but will form a
new society. Dr. Leary believes
that the government is conspir-
ing against people getting high,
but it cannot legislate morals
and will eventually legalize
‘(pot)’

Concluding, Dr. Leary clasped
his hands together as if in pray-
er, and said, “I salute the God
within you.”

 

 

For Arts, Sciences Faculty

by DAN BOOKER

A 164-year tradition kill-
ed in 1958, has been revived
in the plans for the organiz-
ation of the new Faculty of
Arts and Sciences. The name
of the School of Liberal Arts
will be changed to the “College”
of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences, thus reinstating a name
used from 1794 to 1958.

This change along with others
concerning the internal organi-
zation of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences was announced
Friday in a memo from Dean of
the Faculty David Halliday to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. Dr.
Posvar forwarded a copy of the
memo to all University faculty
members and expressed his con-
ﬁdence that “the new internal
arrangements will facilitate the
strengthening of our academic
programs.”

The new organization does
away with the divisional system
in which the deans of the hu-
manities, social sciences, and
natural sciences had responsi-
bility for budget, appointments,

promotions, and program devel-
opment. There is now a s-in-gle
faculty for all operations, ex-
cept the professional schools.
Under the old arrangement,
said Halliday, the deans of lib-
eral arts and general studies
had no faculty. Now these deans,
Dr. James Kehl and Dr. Viers
Adams, respectively, will advise
Halliday in policy matters. Reg-

Demonstration Right Upheld

VVILLIAMSBURG, Va. Oct. 8
——Douglas Cater, special assis-
tant to the President for educa-
tion, told representatvies from

eight college student newspa-

pers, “Dem-onstratio-ns are a
very appropriate manner for
students to voice discontent and
dissent.”

Cater made the remark in re-
sponse to a question put to him
concerning his opinion of the
upcoming March on Washing-
ton, scheduled for Oct. 21. He
spok-e at the Intern-ational Con-
ference for the World Crisis in
Education -being held -in Wil-
l-iamsburg, Va. The conference
was called for by the Rresident
to evidence this “most earnest
interest in world education,” Ca-
ter emphasized.

Concerning the freedom of
dissent on the University cam-

Latin American
Lecture Planned

The Center for Latin Ameri-
can Studies will sponsor a lec-
ture by Dr. Jose Moreno con-
cerning the ”‘Domin;ican Revolu-
tion of 1965,” Wednesday at 4

p.m. in Dining Room A of the
Union.

Holding an MA in theology
and currently studying for a
Ph.D. in sociology at Cornell
University, Dr. Moreno cooper-
ated with national and interna-
tional agencies in Santo Domin-
go -to restore peace during the
April revolution. He founded
and personally directed battle-
zone centers to oversee food dis-
tribution, vaccinations, human
rights and medical aid.

Dr. Morena, ﬂuent in six lan-
guages, has published ﬁve ma-
jor sociological studies.

 

pus today as compared to two
decades ago, he expressed his
belief that there is much great-
er freedom to protest today than
in bygone years.

However, Cater proved un-
aware of the presence of FBI
agents on university campuses
throughout the country. He
nonetheless maintained that

there is “greater freedom in re-
gard to physical harm that
might come to the dissenter.”
Cater arrived at the confer-
ence early this morning in or-
der to make arrangements for
Frresident Johnson's arrival,
which is expected at approxi-
mately 6 pm. this evening.

Biblical Scholar Conquers
“Tag The Towers” Contest

The Pitt News feature staff, after astute consideration of each
and every entry, is ﬁnally ready to announce the winner of their
ﬁrst annual “Tag the Towers Contest" “But don't you think it was
an easy job,” Dan Lichtenstein, associate feature editor said. “We

knew what a great responsibil-
ity we had to the campus."

“There’s no doubt -about it,”
Hobart Harris, feature editor
said, “Dan was stuck o-n Ajax,
Babbo, and Cornet, _and it was a
real ﬁne thing for h-im to do
‘to realize that Dr. P.’s entry
just wouldn't cut the ice.”

The winner, by the way, was
James R. 01p of 250 Melwood
Ave His contribution to poster-
ity were the names Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego. There
has been no comment from the
Men's Dorm Council.

The response to the contest
was so great that Harris and
Lichtenstein were forced to lock
themselves up in the Pitt News
office for three straight nights
in order to narrow the decision
down to two or three entries.
The effect of this was felt im-
mediately throughout the cam-
pus. “This place has been like a
morgue since those boys locked
themselves up,” Mis Karen Dep-
po, senior resident of Abednego
said, “the girls only leave their
room to eat and go to classes.
It's terrible.”

SG Spirit Group
Meets Tomorrow

The Student Government (SG)
Spirit Committee will hold its
first meeting tomorrow at 7 pm.
in 302 SU. This year, member-
ship will be open to all under-
graduates who wish to help
with the general promotion of
spirit on the Un-iversity campus.

SG Senator Bill Ralph, chair-
man of the Spirit Committee,
hopes to enlist a large commit-
-tee. “An important goal of the
committee,” stated Ralph, “is to
explore new areas of spirit pro-

motion.”

Ralph also stated that spirit
points (points given -to campus
organizations for spirit) will be
posted at the end of the football
season and half-way rlihirou-gh
the basketball season.

 

ular operations of the College
will, however, be no different
from the operation of the SLA.

A central feature of the or-
ganization, said Halliday, is that
the heads of the 31 departments
and special programs will re-
port directly to  Halliday
hopes that the new plan will
strengthen departmental auton-
omy.

A separate department for
graduate studies, with Dr. Rich-
ard McCoy as director, will com-
bine the admissions and record-
keeping function -nouw housed in
the three divisional offices. A
Graduate Council, elected by the
faculty with two representatives
from each of the former divi-
sions, will recommend to the
University G rad ua te Council
minimum requirements for grad-
uate degrees and plans for new
graduate programs.-

To preserve some of the val-

ues of the divisional system, ex-,

plained Halliday, three addition-
al councils are being establish-
ed: the Humanities Council, the

‘Natural Sciences Council, and

the Social Sciences Council.
These will consist of the chair-
men of the departments former-
ly included in each division.
Halliday said that these councils

will have no operational control 

but will act in an advisory ca.-
pacity.
Halliday
p:osi»tions of deans of each divi-
sion have been abolished. Dr.
Hibbard Kline had been serving

as acting dean of social sciences, _

and Dr. Jack Matthews was act-
ing dean of humanities. Be-
cause of their experience, Halli-
day has asked them. .to serve as
the ﬁrst chairmen of their re-
spective councils. 'Ilhey will
serve in this post for a year.
Halliday pointed out that this
new plan will be phased in over
a period of months. He -stated
that, as an ultlimaste result, “Un-

dergraduate education should be _

greatly enhanced.” Hopefully, he
added, t-he beneﬁts of the new
structure will come in a year.

Beta Beta Beta Lecture

Expert Analyzes Pollution

by LARRY GLANZ

“In the past ten years there
‘has been more concern for clean
air and water than in the past
100 years,” said Dr. Maurice
Shapiro of the University Grad-
uate School of Public Health.
His remarks were made at a
seminar on the biological and
social problems of pollution
sponsored by Beta Beta Beta, the
honorary biology fraternity.
“The questio-n now is how bad
is the problem and what are its
effects on health?” Dr. Sha.piro
continued.

“ resent studies have failed
to produce evidence that air
pollution has unhealthy effects.
The effects of water pollution
are hard to measure also. The
fact remains that now as never
before in history,” maintained
Shapiro, “we are looking toward
future genearations, and pollu-
tion is on the increase.

Dr. Shiapiro indicated that in-
dustry was concerned as well.
“They must learn to reclaim re-
sources which are presently be-
ing wasted and which are now
polluting our air and Water.

“Pesticides, a boon to man
have been responsible for such
incidents as the recent death of
17 children in Mexico.”

When asked what remedies
he would propose for these prob-
lems, Dr. Shapiro was admitted-
ly equivocal. “We have in the
past erected barriers and con-
trols, but even though these
have proved 95 per cent effec-
tive the problem will continue
to increase.” But he is optimis-
tic ithrat solutions can be found.

   

“We can pair industries so that
the waste of one becomes the

product of‘ano«t’her. But we must all of us."

Dr. David Halli-day’s announcement concerning the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences more clearly deﬁnes a vital aspect of the reorganization
plan announced by Chancellor Posvar early this term, namely, the pro-
posed College of Arts and Sciences.

. The duties formerly assigned to the Dean of the School of Liberal
Arts (SLA) will still be handled by Dr. James Kehl, although his title
will now be Dean of the College. Since taking over as De-an of SLA, Dean
Kehl has proved his competency. Since Dr. Halliday stated that the reg-
ular operations of the College will be no different from the operation of
SLA, Dean Kehl can continue working along the effective lines he has
in the past.

One of Dean Keh1’s special areas of concern has been his work with

Wthe liberal Arts Cabinet, and he has shown his support for students by
 advocating the adoption of such programs as the pass-fail option now

open to juniors and seniors.
A new department announced by Dean Halliday will concern itself
with graduate studies, combining the admissions and record-keeping

“functions now done by the three divisional offices. This move is certainly

   

iving for Efficiency

stating that “the new internal arrangements will facilitate the strength-
ening of our academic programs.

Another progressive step is the establishment of advisory coun-
cils in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, while abolish-
ing the current policy of maintaining deans for these three areas. The
heads of the 31 departments and special programs will now report directly
to Dean Halliday, a move to strengthen departmental autonomy. The
establishment of the Humanities Council, the Natural Sciences Council,
and the Socal Sciences Council will allow the new operation to operate
with greater continuity, as it bridges the gap between the previous prac-
tice and the new structure. ‘

Dean Halliday’s announced organization for the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences demonstrates his concern for a more effective organizational
structure, while still recognizing the value of retaining the more desir-
able elements of our previous structure.

As Dr. Halliday pointed out, the “beneﬁts of the new structure
will come in a year.” However, with only the outline before us at present,
we feel that if all aspects are successful, great strides will be made in

  

. in keeping with Dr. Posvar’s memo to all University faculty members

..A Symbol of What?

The Wearing of The White

WHO IN the University
would walk around every
Wednesday with a white rag
tied above his left elbow.

A freshman might. Ho-p-
ing to impress his friends at
home or his new acquain-
tances in the dorm, a fresh-
man may wear a white rag.
He may want to s=hock his
parents. Or, this may be one
way to have a symbol of in-
dividuality for one face in a
crowd of 2,000 freshmen.
...:Qne_-of. those pretty girls
with long hair and an em-
pty head might. Maybe her
boyfriend"is a member of
Students for Peace. Maybe
she wants a boyfriend from
Students for Peace.

SOMEONE WHO wants to
walk around campus with an
air of self-righteousness
might.

A confused person might
wear a white rag. Confused
because on one sign you are
told that to wear a rag is to
be concerned. On another
sign it states that to wear a

white rag is to be for US
withdrawal from Vietnam.
These are two entirely differ-
ent things.

But in all honesty, ‘it is
doubtful that this would oc-
cur, for no one could be so
confused as to mistakenly
wish to associate himself

‘with the Students for Peace.

SUBTRA.CT ALL these
and you have a few young
men and women who have,
after many hours of deep
thought and study, sincerely
come to the conclusion that
they are opposed to United
States involvement in the
War in Vietnam.

These few have chosen the
correct color symbol for their
armbands: the symbol of
surrender. For after you
take away the nice phrases
such as “new approach” and
“enlightened thinkxing” this
is what the rags are all
about.

As everyone grows more
weary over this dragged-out
war and protests against it,

clearer.

WHETHER IT’S Russian,
Chinese, or North Vietna-
mese communism, the ma-

. j ority of the people of South

Vietnam do not want it.
Whether the North Vietna-
mese want communism no-
body will ever know because,
unlike South Vietnam, elec-
tions are not permitted. Or,
if you prefer this phrase,
elections are not attempted.

The United States is aid-
ing‘ the people of South Viet-
nam to defend themselves
against a minority of domes-
tic communists and a large
number of invaders from
North Vietnam.

Civilians are killed, as in
any war, but no one kills
them like the Viet Cong
does. If the United States is
guilty of any atrocities, they
are miniscule compared to
the deliberate terrorist ac-
tivities of the communists.

THOSE WHO are opposed E

to the war in the United
States must also be embar-
rassed by the display of bat-
tle cries uttered by Vietnam
Doves against the “evil”
Arabs this summer. But
most Vietnam Doves do not
seem shaken by this hypo-
crisy.

Certainly, every thinking
American is concerned about
the war, but only a few Uni-
versity students parade
around with surrender arm-
bands.

Library Episode

Editor, The Pitt News:

One week ago I received an
invoice from University of Pitts-
burg Library Services advising

‘me that I owed the University

$2.50 for‘ a lost library book. I
immediately telephoned the li-
brary and said that I had re-
turned the book prior to the
August vacation period. It was
suggested that I had not, and
that I had probably returned it
-to ‘another library in error. I
asked if there could have been
an error -at the library and was
assured that this was most un-
likely.

I then recounted my experi-
ence of having approximately
six reminder notices from one
of the smaller libraries and sub
sequently going there myself
and locating the “overdue” books
on the shelf. I was rather stun-
ned to be ‘told by this same li-
brarian (the one I was tele-
phoning) that I had probably
placed the books on the shelf to
get out of paying ﬁnes. I asked
when I could come to the li-
brary and settle the matter. I
was told to wait a week (until
yesterday) and come and pay
the account if the book was still
miss-ing. In the meantime I was
advised to go to the other li-
braries and try to ﬁnd it—-I did
this without having any success

Yesterday I went in to the li-
brary with the invoice only to
be told that the book had been
found. The librarian then ac-

terms of a more effective administrative structure. ~ *

-

the Editor

cused me in front of a number
of other librarians and in front
of my friend of having come to
the library (to the closed stacks)
and of having placed the book
in its correct place. This, be-
tween the time I had called her
on the telephone and yesterday.
I was very annoyed but did not
lose my temper at her (accusa-
tion. Finally, it was agreed that
I would not be charged the $2.50
but that t-here would be a crec-
ord of it and that if the same
thing happened again I would
certainly be charged If my in-
terpretation was correct I would
be permanently in the “black
book.” a

The whole incident was most
d=is.tresvs:i.ng. I (am :a foreign stu-
dent and have attended a num-
ber of universities (ﬁve) inside
and outside of the US. This is
the ﬁrst time I have been so
badly treated.

If the library was efficient I
could understand the blind faith
in the infallibility of the system.
However, from past experience
I know it not to be.

I wonder how many other stu-
dents have received such cava-
lier treatment.

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular
kinds of guys. Except bigger.

And that can be an advantage.

How? Well, for one thing, you‘ve got more going for
you. Take Ford Motor Company. A giant in an exciting

and vital business. Thinking giant thoughts. About develop» A

ing Mustang. Cougar. A city car for the future.

Come to work for this giant and you‘ll begin to think
like one.

Because you’re dealing with bigger problems, the
consequences, of course, will be greater. Your responsibilities
heavier. That means your experience must be better———more
complete. And so, you‘ll get the kind of opportunities only a
giant can give.

Giants just naturally seem to attract top professionals.
Men that you‘ll be working with and for. And some of that
talent is bound to rub off.

Because there's more to do, you‘ll learn more. In
more areas.

  What’s

Youill develop a talent for making hard»nosed, imaginar
tive decisions. And you‘ll know how these decisions affect
the guts of the operation. At the grass roots. Because you'll
have been there.

If youldlike to be a giant yourself, and your better
ideas are in ﬁnance, product engineering, manufacturing,
marketing and sales, personnel administration or systems
research, see the man from Ford when he visits your campus.
Or send your resume to Ford Motor Company, College
Recruiting Department. ,

You and Ford can grow bigger together.

. HART: “I JUST DON’T KNOW”

MORGANTOWN, W. Va. — “Michigan State 35, Wis-
con 7, in the fourth quarter,” blared the loudspeaker in the
press box. The Wisconsin scout sitting in the ﬁrst row turn-

ed his head toward the Western Union tickers and winced.

slightly, but then he shifted his attention back to the play
on the ﬁeld and a noticeable smile returned to his face.

No doubt he would tell the Wisconsin coaching staff
he had observed a team which the winless Badgers could
beat without much difficulty. And if the Panthers persist
in playing uninspired football, there’s no doubt that the
scout will be absolutely right.

“West Virginia,” Dave Hart admitted after the game,
“didn’t do anything different. There weren’t any innova-
tions in their game plan. We were pre-pared for everything

b they did today. He paused, “I just don’t know what’s

wrong.”

THE PANTHER OFFENSE was humiliated by an un-
spectacular Mountaineer defense. If WVU coach Jim Carlen
had blitzed his linebackers on every play, the Panthers
wouldn’t have passed their own 20 year line. The offensive
line spent most of its time watching Frank Gustine or Jeff
Barr getting snowed under by untouched Mountaineers.

“I thought we would come on today,” said Hart. “We
had a good week of practice. Maybe the Illinois game really
was the ‘hump’ game of our season . . . I don’t know.

“But I thought everyone had a certain amount of pride.
Now I’m not sure,” he said. “When everything goes bad

‘like this, you begin to doubt your players, your coaches,

and yourself. I don’t know our kids anymore. I don’t know
Whether they’re up or not.

“HECK, IF YOU can’t get up for West Virginia . . .”
Hart didn’t ﬁnish his thoughts aloud.

The Mountaineers had no trouble getting up for‘Pitt.
As Hart put it, “T'hey"ve tasted victory. It doesn’t matter
who they’Ve played. Heck, it could have been the Sisters
of the Poor. At least they know what it means to win, and
believe m.e, the taste of victory is sweet.”

The Panthers 'don’t know What it means to win. They
haven’t got the conﬁdence in their ability to score, let alone
the feeling of being able to win when they’re trailing by a
few points.

In contrast, teams like UCLA sometimes generate new
victories solely because they’ve won before. Fresh from a
come-from-behind win over Penn.State, Gary Beban and

HART talks to the offensive line during the ‘game.

his teammate-s told this writer at a ZBT fraternity party
Saturday nights, “It makes all the difference in the world.”

“WE CAN BE‘ DOWN 10 or 20 points and still have
the feeling that we’re going to win the ballgame,’ ’said
Bruin tackle Alan Claman. ‘

Dave Hart could only say things like, “Take poor Bob
Longo. He needed -four catches to break a record. That’s an
easy game for him, and we couldn’t even get him the ball.”

One has to wonder what the defensive unit feels like

V now. They held West Virginia without a touchdown; they

recovered three fumbles when it seemed certain that WVU
W-ould score; they stopped the Mountaineers on a fourth

‘ down sneak, and all while playing the ridiculous total of 39

minutes.

“IT SEEMED A LOT LONGER,” said defensive coach
Bill Neal. “But they kept battling, even when there was

‘four seconds left.”

The entire Panther squad is going to have to start

Associate Sports Editor

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.
-— Pitt played one of its
worst games in its 78 year
history here Saturday when the
Mountaineers blanked the Pan-
thers, 15-0.

Unable to score, unable to
mount an offensive, -nothing was
more disappointing than the
Panthers’ showing. Nothing
worked, and no one had the an-
swevrs, including Dave Hart.

He was sick over the Jungle
Cats’ ninth consecutive lo-ss, the
third this year. “It was the most
dis-aprpointinug game I’ve ever
seen and . . . the most disap-
pointing game I hope to see,”
said Hart, a beaten man.

“Nobody played football today

. nobody.” Hart continued.
“They weren’t ready to play
football We over pressured our
defense although at times, they
looked decent. But there’s just
not one good thing I can say
about the offense.”

For 60 minutes, it was an
agonizing display of football.
In an effort to score, Hart tried
three different quarterbacks, and
twice as many backs, but noth-
ing worked against a stiff West
Virginia defense; not even the
special plays the team had ‘prac
ticed all last week.

The Cats’ offensive line played
lousy football. “Our line couldn't
pick up a blitz; they didn’t give
protection to our quarterback-s,”
Hart said.

The offensive line didn’t open
many holes either, and when it
did, the Panther backs wouldn’t
run through it. The Cats’ back-
ﬁeld rushed for a minus 21
yards. Mike Raklewicz gained
eights yards on five carries; Pri-
bish, 20 on nine.

Although the Panthers’ two
first downs came o.n passes, the
aerial game was nil. “We didn’t
h-ave a quarterback that could
get the bail to our receivers.”
Hart said, whilelthe Pitt crowd
in the 35,000, hollered, “We want
Bazylak.” Bob Bazylak was the
number one qunarterbua-ck until
two weeks before the season
started.

The Cat defense, however,
stopped the Mountaineers 12

Booters Finally Score,

Deadlock Ohio U.,1-1

After a drought which lasted 349 minutes, the soccer
team ﬁnally scored its ﬁrst goal of the season. It was

enough to give them a 1-1 tie with Ohio U. Saturday at Athens.
The booters’ scoring drought went three games and three quar-

ters before Pete Snyder ﬁnally
tallied with 14 minutes left in
Sraturday’~s game.

Snyder’s goal tied the score
at 1-1. Only a minute earlier,
Ohio U. scored after a scram-
ble in front of booter goalie Len
Harmon.

Immediately after the Ohio
goal, the booters took the ball
down the ﬁeld and scored. Sopho-
more center forward Bob Trex-
ler dribbled in and sent a per-
fect pass to Snyder in front Of
the net.

The goal seemed to spark the
bo-oters. "We controlled the
game,” commented fullback
Mike Schalk. “Our offense was
working. They were lucky to tie
us.”

But the booters missed sever-
al ﬁne scoring opportunities.

The best chance was a pen-
alty kick taken by Dave Shim-
peno with eight minutes left,
but the ball hit the crossbar.
Earlier, Shimpeno had hit the
crossbar on a shot from the
ﬁeld. “I don’t know what it is,”

Shimpeno' said. “Usually I’m
lucky with shots, but this year
I've been unlucky. Everything
is just missing.”

That seems to be the story
for the whole soccer team this
year.

no better.
