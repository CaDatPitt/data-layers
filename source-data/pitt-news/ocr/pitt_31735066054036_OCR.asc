It was called AntiOnline. Three Pitt
freshmen dedicated the website to protect-
ing various computer systems from hack-
ers, both mischievous and criminal.

The website listed ﬂaws in computer
programs like Windows95 and operating
systems like UNIX. It also explained how
to remedy these glitches that might poten-
tially cripple countless Intemet-run busi-
nesses.

But Pitt oﬂicials have pulled the plug
on these freshmen, stating the three
improperly used their Internet privileges
for commercial gain, though the three
claim they never charged visitors for the
infomration AntiOnline provided.

“All the services we provided were
free, so I don’t see what it is we were
doing wrong,” said John Vranesevich of
himself and his friends who ran
AntiOnline —-— Robert Dailey and
Christopher Zilinski.

That’s when the three asked for sup-
port from Internet users.

“Pitt has a security webpage where
they post ﬂaws in different operating sys-
tems and programs — it’s a lot like our
webpage. We don’t see how we violated
any policies,” Vranesevich said.

Pitt officials are restricted by the
Buckley Amendment from communicat-
ing with any outside sources about the
details of any students’ judicial cases.

“It was felt by individuals in CIS that
they were in violation of certain policies,”
said Ken Service, ofﬁcial Pitt spokesper-
son. Vranesevich said the University’s
“No Contact Order” prevents them from
discussing the problem with Bannister,
who they claim went over their heads in
the ﬁrst place, instead of bringing the
problem with AntiOnline to their attention.

“This could have been avoided with a
phone call,” Vranesevich said. “I would
have been more than happy to comply to
follow University guidelines.”

Martian invasion on 300 at Pitt

Member of Mars Pathfinder team discusses the mission

Staff Wrlter

Space may be the ﬁnal frontier,
but Mars was brought one step closer
to Earth on Thursday night.

Using 3-D photographs and

Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., presented an overview of the

The committee searching for a new dean of Pitt's
Faculty of Arts and Sciences decided last week to allow
SGB member David Teeters to sit on the committee —
one week after saying that he would not.

Two weeks ago, it was reported that SGB President

Mars Pathfmder mission to a crowd
of 300 in Clapp Hall.

The JPL built and designed the
Pathfinder for NASA, which
launched from Cape Canaveral on
Dec. 6, 1996 and landed on Mars on
July 4, 1997. The Sojourner rover, an
ll—kilogram robot which drives on
six wheels in a 100-foot radius area
around the landing site, was then
deployed.

Anderson, an educational out-
reach coordinator for JPL received
his Ph.D. in geology and planetary
sciences from the University of
Pittsburgh in 1995. He was also a
member of the mineralogy and geo-
chemistry science operations group
on the Pathﬁnder mission.

As educational outreach coordi-

nator, he deals with the media and
gives lectures across the country
about the Pathﬁnder mission.

During his presentation,
Anderson detailed the ﬁndings,
described the glitches, and discussed
the surprising discoveries of the mis-
sron.

"Pathﬁnder was originally
designed to be an engineering
demonstration," said Anderson. "We
decided to take this a little further and
add science to it."

He answered the skeptics’ asser-
tions that the mission was a failure by

Justin DalMolin, who had been appointed by the provost
to represent undergraduates on the search committee,
had not participated in the search since last April.

When asked about his failure to attend any of the
meetings in the last six months, DalMolin said that
Teeters would be taking his place on the committee. But
search committee chair Edward Stricker said that
DalMolin was not empowered to name his own replace-
ment.

Stricker said the provost decided not to replace
DalMolin on the committee, since too much had been
accomplished and too much time had passed for replac-
ing him to be a reasonable move.

After six months of meetings, learning and decision
making for the active committee members, Stricker said
bringing somebody new onto the committee would have
been useless and, perhaps, counterproductive.

Last week, however, the decision was changed and
Teeters was allowed to sit on the committee, but as a

Some students may want to try a little

Or maybe smell some Clary sage for

head.

Maybe some students should also
eliminate coffee and "O" pizza and opt for
healthier choices. _

Most of these essential oils can

They can also be used in massage oils,

If you decide to get the oils in their nat-

cost between $8-$17 a vial.

She won't use coffee, soda or bass

instead has armed herself with peppermint
and basil.

‘'1 just put a little dab of these essential
oils under my noseand on my pulse points,
and I know it will keep me alert," said
Critchﬁeld, manager of Journeys of Life, a
holistic store in Shadyside.

Like Critchﬁeld, the lure most people
have to aromatherapy is the relaxed feeling
they receive from the scented oils.

These essential oils (meaning oils in
their pure form) are extracted from plants,
herbs and ﬂowers and can trigger an ener-
gy response from the olfactory senses and
send it to the brain.

Each oil possesses a "curing" element
to eliminate or case the discomfort of cer-
tain ailments, like headaches or the ﬂu.

"Remember, though, that all these oils
are individualized," said Critchﬁeld. "What
may work for one person may not work for
another." _

The following is an abridged guide to
the most popular essential oils and what
some say they can relieve.

Lavender: It's the most popular oil and
helps headaches and stress.

Pine: Helps relieve the effects of colds, the
ﬂu, or bronchitis.

Peppermint: Used to boost energy
Tangerine: Relieves insomnia or anxious-
ness. '

Ylang Ylang: A love potion or aphrodisi-
ac.

Birch: Relieves sore, stiff muscles.
Grapefruit: Helps relieve symptoms asso-

Even though it took time to wean him-
self oﬂ° the mozzarella cheese and T-bone
steaks, Musolino has never felt more ener-
getic.

"I don't feel lethargic anymore," said
Musolino, who doesn't mind a higher gro-
cery bill_each month for his organic foods.

"It's like when people eat pizza and
feel so lazy afterwards. It's because their
bodies need time to absorb all the fat."

Deborah Barr, of Whole Health
Resources and an afﬁliate of Magee
Womens Hospital, said diet is the most
inﬂuential part of our overall well—being.

"Food is vibrational energy," said Barr,
who instructs people on healthier ways to
eat. "We eat every day. It is the one aspect
of our life that we have complete control
over."

Barr said that many foods in our
everyday diet can stress our organs, our
emotions and our minds.

"There are certain foods I consider
'l1igh stress foods,'" said Barr. "Coffee,
alcohol, sweets, dairy products, chernical—
ized food and animal protein are all deplet-

_ ing to our body and minds."

Cathyanne Ferree, manager of
Shadyside Natural Foods, says college stu-
dents can make small choices in their diets
to ease stress.

"You don't have to eliminate every-
thing from your diet," said Ferree. "There
are inexpensive snacks, teas and supple-
ments that can make a big difference in
your study habits."

Barr and Ferree suggest a couple of
substitutes for the "high stress foods" in our

Local band Left on Dorris plays for the students in Eddie's Cafe on Thursday
evening. This concert was sponsored by Tower A as part of Lothrop Challenge.

Lothrop Challenge underway as
halls compete to raise money

James Maude
Staff wrlter

Residents of Lothrop Hall are
issuing a challenge to the residents
of the other residence halls — “raise
more charity money than us.”

From Nov. 3 to Dec. 3, the
Resident Student Association is
organizing a charity drive across
campus. The aim of the drive is to
collect as much money for charity as
possible.

Each residence hall selects a
charity, and the hall which collects
the most money per student (total
revenue divided by number of resi-
dents) during the 30 days wins the
challenge.

Mike Unangst, vice chairman of
the RSA and president of Lothrop
Hall, said this is a competitive
event, “especially within the
Towers.”

However, according to Unangst,
there are no prizes or trophies for the
residence hall which raises the most
money. The annual event gains a lot
of support from the students, though.

“It usually goes pretty well. We
have a goal [to collect] $2,000
between all the buildings,” said
Unangst.

Lothrop has selected the Hand-
in-Hand Foundation as this year’s
charity. According to Unangst,
Lothrop’s drive events include sell-
ing candy and holding a raffle.

Residents of Tower C are
responding to this challenge by rais-
ing money for the Make-A-Wish
Foundation.

Kourosh Parsia, president of
Tower C, said his residents are using
several different methods to raise
money.

For example, they are selling
tickets to an upcoming Pittsburgh
Penguins/Philadelphia Flyers game,
and on that evening will be having a
pizza party and watching the game
on television. Tower C is also having
its resident assistants have a "penny
bucket," and the ﬂoor which collects
the most pennies wins a pizza party.

“This drive unites the whole
building as a team,” said Parsia.
“Plus this is really a lot of fun.”

On Thursday night, residents of

Tower A hosted a concert in the

Towers cafeteria. They had been
selling tickets for the previous two
weeks.

They are also having a 50/50 raf-
ﬂe. Half of the proceeds goes to the
winner and the other half goes to
Tower A residents‘ selected charity,
the Kevin Cecil Fund, which was
established to help former Pitt stu-
dent Kevin Cecil who was shot and
paralyzed two years ago with his
medical bills.

"We are also having a rent-an-
RA event," said Drew Lesicko, a res-
ident assistant in Tower A. "RAs
auction themselves off to students to
perform menial tasks such as laun-
dry and cleaning." '

Despite the creativity exhibited
for this year's money-making strate-
gies, there are guidelines as to how
money can be raised. The fund rais-
ing can only be done within the con-
fines of the particular residence hall,
and solicitation of funds is not
allowed.

Although monies received have
not been officially tallied and
released, Unangst said the charity
drive is going well so far and “that
this is looking to be one of our bet-
ter years.”

Coffee: "Coffee is like sweeping," said
Ferree. "At ﬁrst you hold the broom real

eventually it will make you more tired."

non—voting member.

"[The decision] wasn't reversed," said
Stricker, who argued that because Teeters
would be a non—voting member, the earli-
er concems about bringing Teeters up-to-
date on the committee's progress wouldn't
be a problem.

"[Teeters] doesn't know anything that
has preceded this," Stricker said, "but we
did want him to be in attendance at the
meetings to observe what's going on."

Stticker denied the allegation that
Teeters’ acceptance on the committee was
a rubber-stamping to show that under-
graduates are being involved in the
search.

"I don't think anyone is going to see it
that way," he said.

All this has taken place since last
Thursday, the second day of dean candi-
date David Magidson's three-day visit to
Pitt's campus. Pitt plans to host visits for
all ﬁve remaining candidates —— the six
selected by the search committee, minus
Wendy Wilkins of Arizona State who has
accepted an appointment to Michigan
State.

Magidson, a professor of theatre arts
and former dean of Fine, Performing and
Communication Arts at Wayne State
University, spent last Wednesday through
Friday exploring the campus and meeting
with the chancellor, the provost, several
other administrators, faculty, staff and a
few selected undergraduates.

Thursday, Magidson gave a public
seminar about a theory of dramatic devel-
opment in plays and ﬁlms, and Friday he
hosted an open forum for students, facul-
ty and staff to ask questions. He respond-
ed to questions ranging from evaluations
of research to fund raising, to the use of
post-doctoral teaching fellows to his
administrative philosophy.

About 30 students, faculty and staff
were in attendance at the seminar, and
only about 20 attended the open forum.

Stricker conveyed disappointment
with the low attendance at the meetings,
saying that this is a truly important issue

FROM PAGE 1

V for the University right now, and it is dis-

appointing that more did not attend.

The open forums are a great way for
people to meet the candidates and to eval-
uate them, he said.

"You'll see their differences and simi-
larities very clearly at the forums,"
Stricker said. He said the search comrnit—
tee wants to know what people at the
forums think, and everyone at the forums
are given evaluation forms to return to the
committee.

The next candidate to speak to the Pitt
community will not really be visiting ——
he lives here. John Cooper is a professor
in Pitt's chemistry department. He will
deliver a public seminar today at 3 p.m. in
Chevron Science Center, Room 12B,
titled "Activation of Benzene by Highly
Reduced Transition Metal Complexes."
He will host an open forum Tuesday at
3:30 p.m. in the Kurtzman Room of the
William Pitt Union.

pointing to a slide of the ﬁrst picture taken
of the Martian surface and saying, "NASA
said that this shot alone would've made the
mission a success.

"If you build a mission for 30 days, and
it lasts 90 days, how can it be a failure,"
Anderson added later.

He said the mission’s budget was
around $150 million, and with the cost of
the launchpad and other expenses, it even—
tually cost around $250 million.

"It was designed to be economical and
cost-effective," said Anderson.

He explained to the audience the logis-
tics involved in such an ambitious mission
in launching it, getting it to Mars, and land-
ing it safely on the Martian surface.

"For the landing, there were 130 steps
we had to go through in 70 minutes, and
each one was executed perfectly,"
Anderson said.

Anderson also discussed how the rocks
came to have names such as Yogi, Barnacle
Bill and Hippo.

"We would've called them names such
as Al, B 1, Cl, but that would've been bor-
ing," said Anderson. "One guy at the lab
said, ‘Hey, that rock there looks like it's had
bamacles on it,‘ and then another guy start-
ed humming the Barnacle Bill theme tune,
and that's how it started. We realized after
people started sending us stuffed toys that
we should‘ve named them Mercedes,
BMW, and Lexus."

Anderson also explained how the

Sojourner became "attracted to" a particular
rock named Wedge, which created the
numerous "rock humping" jokes in the
press. Anderson cited a slight fault in a gyro
as the probable cause.

He also described some of the surpris-
ing discoveries that were made due to thor-
ough examination of the martian rocks.
One was that the first rock analyzed
revealed signs of andesitic volcanism, and
that others may have been cut by water.

"A lot of rocks on the Martian surface
are sedimentary rocks, and as most people
know, a huge proportion of sedimentary
rocks form where there's water," said
Anderson. "And the area we selected looks
like it could have been a giant ﬂood plain.

Though, I believe the water
dried up around 3 billion
years ago, but ask someone
else at the lab, and they
could tell you something
different."

The Pathﬁnder also
recorded the appearance of
small fast—moving cirrus
clouds near the atmosphere,
small tornadoes, and static
dust which coated most of
site.

Anderson said the
landing site was chosen
because it was on the equa-

tor, it was ﬂat, and it received the most sun-

light.

"The Cydonia complex [the pyramid

 

He said

A formation] is near the

North Pole," said
Anderson. "That's why we
didn't send it there."

Anderson rounded off
the overview by talking
about a dozen future rnis—
sions, including an ambi-
tious project that would
send a probe to Mars to
retrieve rocks from the
surface and bring them
back to Earth.

Anderson said the 800
million hits on the JPL
website, which had mirror
sites across the globe,

broke all Internet records. This, he said,
indicated that the Mars Pathﬁnder mission
captivated the entire world.

Guilty of hi

Since when does a university refuse to provide students
with information? Isn’t Pitt supposed to educate?

Pitt is hiding something again.

Surprise, surprise. ,

This time the University won’t explain the charges it is
bringing against Pitt student John Vranesevich, who it
claims has disobeyed Pitt’s computer access rules

Vranesevich, with the help of two other students, main-
tained a website from his dormitory room at Pitt. Named
“AntiOnline,” the site provided Internet users with infor-
mation about how to prevent hacking on computer sys-
tems.

Pitt has recently pulled the plug on Vranesevich and
removed his Internet access privileges via University sys-
tems. Pitt has ﬁled judicial board charges against him and
his assistants. They could be expelled.

They don’t even know why.

Pitt claims the website was a commercial venture, even
though Vranesevich contends that no money was made or
even solicited.

Pitt refuses to explain to those involved what exactly
was wrong with the site.

What’s more, Pitt cut off his Internet access before
even ﬁling charges or trying to get in touch with him to
resolve the problem. Dennis Donham, assistant vice chan-
cellor for student affairs, said Pitt usually tries to resolve
problems with students without resorting to a judicial board
hearing. But no effort was made this time to ﬁx anything.

Instead, Pitt went directly to the judicial board.

State and federal legal suits are public infonnation
because the results set legal precedents. Pitt is bound by the
Buckley Amendment -— a law which prohibits Pitt from
making such information about students public when
charges are kept within the University’s judicial system.
But the results still set precedents for future cases.

For that very reason, it is important that Pitt explains to
students what policies are in violation to attempt to rectify

problems before going to the judicial board. Otherwise,

students have no way of knowing what the rules really are.
If Pitt wants to ﬁx problems, the best way to do it is to
communicate with the students to make sure they under-
stand the rules.
Preventing problems is better than just punishing the

. offenders.

1) He must impale himself

Don’t tell me whatto wear on ‘Gay Jeans Day’

Dan

Ertman

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, I wore a
suit to all of my classes. This caused
quite a bit of confusion among my class-
mates, as generally, I’m more of the T-
shirt and. jeans type.

Do you have an interview? Are you
being inducted into some kind of honor
society? Is there a wake or something
you have to go to‘? They hounded me for
the better part of ﬁve minutes with these
and other guesses. But none of those
were the reason for my formal outﬁt. In
fact, my reason was by far one of the
most twisted ones my classmates had
ever heard.

You see, the night before, a member
of the Rainbow Alliance called my dorm
room. In a very cheery voice, she
informed me that Wednesdaywould be
“Rainbow Alliance Jeans Day,” on
which, if you wished to show your sup-
port for gay and lesbian rights, all you
had to do was wear jeans.

I was appalled. I was not upset by
the message, as I believe gays and les-
bians should have the same rights as
everyone else. What shocked and
angered me was the tactic. I’ll try to clar-
ify with this analogy: If two Rainbow
Alliance members had come to every

one of my classes and yelled, “If you
support gay rights, shake this gay man’s
hand!!” I would have jumped from my
seat and eagerly and repeatedly shook
his hand.

But that wasn’t what they did. Their
tactic was the equivalent of coming into
the class, and holding up a 3 by 5 index
card, with the words, “If you don’t sup-
port gay rights, please raise your han ,”
printed in very tiny letters. Of course, no
one would have raised their hands
because no one would have been able to
see the card. What the Rainbow Alliance
did was roughly the same.

They took an ordinary activity that
you would probably be doing anyway -
wearing jeans instead of not raising your
hand -— and used it to indicate support
for a cause that the jeans wearer may not
even be aware of. This, to me, is entirely
unacceptable. So, in protest of their tac-
tics, not their message, I went out of my
way not to wear jeans on Wednesday.

Of course, some will say that I still
lost the battle. By my protest, I drew
attention to their cause, which well may
have been what they wanted. I also
allowed them to dictate what clothes I
wore _for that day, which gave them
power and control over me. That, of
course, is-the beauty of their plan. ‘No
matter what I did that day, they won.

' by this action. The anti-

Either I wore jeans, which they could
then claim was a sign of my support for
their cause, or I empowered them by let-
ting them select my wardrobe for the
day.

And the worst
thing about their strate-
gy, I believe, was that
in a general sense, it
was a complete failure.
The Rainbow
Alliance’s primary
goals, tolerance and
awareness, were not
served in the least way

gay society here at Pitt
(which I am fully
aware exists), did not
feel any pressure to
change their ways. In
fact, it may have done
the opposite in that it
gave them one more
reason to hate. In their words, not mine,
on Wednesday, “The damn faggots are
even telling us what to wear now!! They
don’t want equality! They want con-
troll!”

Meanwhile, as far as awareness was
concerned, very few people I talked to
even knew what was going on. (This
seems to be a general problem here at

Pitt. But tl1at’s a different article.) They
had no clue that by wearing or not wear-
ing jeans that day, they had inadvertent-
ly shown their support or lack thereof for
a group. This was probably due to the
fact that the only public-
ity for the event came in
a one-night blitz on
Tuesday, a measure I
believe was taken to
ensure no counter-
demonstration by the
anti-gay community.

I realize that the
Rainbow Alliance needs
to make its message
heard. I just don’t think
this was the right way to
do it. Spread your mes-
sage by word, by march,
by rally, by sit in. Let
them taunt you, tease
you, throw things at
you.‘ But don’t try to

dictate wardrobe, and don’t cite a nor-

mal, everyday action as a sign of sup-
port. After all, the true test of support is
how far out of the norm someone is will-
ing to go for you.

Dan Ertman wants to remind everybody
that Gandhi never told people what to
wear.

In order to pay for tuition, many stu-
dents, like myself, are desperate enough to
work in fast food restaurants. These jobs
are usually low-paying, but often require a
lot of work and can be very frustrating at
times. Dealing with the customers is rarely
an enjoyable experience, and only for the
most patient of us is it at all tolerable.

I never realized how many stupid peo-
ple there are in the world until I started
working at Wendy’s. You would be sur-
prised how many people simply do not
know how to order food properly or how

to go through a drive-thru. I’m sure any-'
one who has ever worked in a restaurant

knows exactly what I’m talking about.

I have never had any trouble ordering
food. It is, after all, a very basic process,
and I assumed most people possessed the
ability to order food in a fast food restau-
rant. I couldn’t have been more wrong. As
it turns out, for many people, ordering din-
ner is a difficult and confusing process.

One day I was working the drive-thru
and took an order for three Diet Cokes and
one Sprite. A rrriddle-aged man and his
family pulled up to the window to pay for

' the drinks. As I was handing the man the

drinks he got a perplexed and angry look
on his face. When I asked him what was
wrong he angrily said “How am I sup-

posed to tell which one is the Sprite?!”
Keep in mind that not only could you
clearly see through the lid which one was
Sprite, you could also see through the cup
that one drink was clear and the others
were not. Not knowing how to respond, I
just said, “It is clear,” shut the window and
walked away.

How can people be so stupid? Even if
you had never seen Diet Coke or Sprite
before, common sense would tell you the
drink that there was only
one of is the Sprite. This
man is probably the
dumbest‘ person I have
ever waited on, but many
others are not too far
behind.

People ask about
such things as the differ-
ence between an all—you—
can—eat salad bar and a
one-trip salad bar, and the
difference between how a
fried and a grilled chick-
en are cooked, just to give a few examples.

To make life easier for food service
people everywhere, I have come up with a
list of proper fast food etiquette that even
the dumbest person is capable of follow-
mg. .

Fast Food Etiquette:
1) For the most part, employees don’t
care if it is your birthday or your dog’s

 

birthday or if you just got back from
Cancun. Keep these facts to yourself.

2) It is not the customer’s job to entertain
the employees with various jokes or anec-
dotes. This includes trying to pick up the
girl working the drive-thru. Fast food
employees are not there to be amused.
Like rule number one, just keep it to your-
self or go ﬁnd someone who cares.

3) For the most part, fast food employees
are of reasonable intelligence. This means
that when ordering food
you don’t need to talk
extremely slowly and
insult our intelligence.
You also don’t have to
say things such as,”I
want that hamburger
plain, that means just the
hamburger and the bun.”
We know what plain
means.

4) Never in any way
touch the drive-thru win-
dow. This includes bang-
ing on the window, opening it, etc.
Touching the window in any way will in
most cases infuriate the employee, possi-
bly causing them to take extra time on
your order.

5) Ask for extras such as ketchup and
sauce for your nuggets when you order,
don’t wait until you are handed your food.

6) Never add anything to your order or

suddenly say you have coupons when you
get to the window. Doing so will only
complicate things greatly and aggravate
the employee attempting to wait on you.

7) There is no need to scream into the
speaker. We can hear you.

8) When pulling up to the window to pay
for food, pull up close enough so the
employee doesn’t need to stretch far
enough that they almost fall out of the
window.

9) Be patient if you have to wait a few
minutes for your food. Most of the time
the delay is because we are waiting for
fresh fries or nuggets. Waiting for fresh

food is no reason to complain. If your life‘

is so busy you don’t have time to wait two
minutes, you are too busy for dinner.

10) Don’t ask how friedand grilled sand-
wiches are cooked. The names are self-
explanatory. If you can’t ﬁgure this out
from the name, skip the fast food and go
ﬁnd a doctor because there is something
wrong with you.

For people who don’t know how to
order food everywhere, hopefully you can
improve by following the above rules. If
not, there may be no help for you. So
please, just stay home and cook.

Carrie Hager thinks that when you take
your driveris test, you should have to pull
up to a drive-thru window ———- since many
people seem to have trouble with this.

Remember how bad Pitt sports used
to be?

About a year ago, the athletics depart-
ment at Pitt had sunk about as low as a
pile of muck scooped up from the bottom
of the Monongahela. »

The University brought in some peo-
ple who had been around winning college
sports teams in the past to try to rebuild
the pathetic program.

Steve Pederson came in with his
“vision” of success for Pitt and shortly
after hired Walt Harris away from Ohio
State. But most people thought salvaging
the athletics department was beyond
hope.
That was before the two got to work.

Pederson orchestrated a complete
department housecleaning, designed
snazzy new “Pittsburg ” uniforms and a
cooler—looking logo, and struck money
making deals with adidas and Champion.

Harris pieced together an experienced

coaching staff and brought his in-your—'

face discipline to the Panthers’ preseason
camp. _

Next thing we know, there are stories
of the players sprinting stadium stairs with
cinder blocks, pushing around construc-
tion machinery, and lumberjacking trees
with sledgehamrners.

It was so refreshing. For the ﬁrst time
in years, people were at least talking about
Pitt football.

The real test of the new Pitt brain trust
would come on the ﬁeld.

People were realistic. They didn’t
expect much winning. They just wanted
to see some improvement.

Pitt had been nauseating for the entire
decade; the players just weren’t that good.

Or so we thought.

We fried the Ragin’ Cajuns in the
opener. Fans were happy, but the Ragin’
Cajuns suck.

Then we went to Happy Valley and
played against “No. 1” Penn State. JoePa
and his boys were supposed to devour us
like a $0.99 Big Mac. They didn’t. Pitt
played admirably, and afterwards a few
heads started to turn. A

After a dramatic win on the road an
in the sweltering heat in Houston, the opti-
mism continued to build.

Then: Thursday night, ESPN,
Homecoming and a major upset against a
Miami team that we didn’t realize sucked
yet. School spirit reached its peak.

Three years ago, Billy West ﬁlled in

his way to a Big East Offensive Player of
the Year. But since then, his career has
been derailed by injuries and a demanding

engineering courseload.

On Saturday, in his last game at Pitt

injured starter — Dwayne Schulters suf-
fered a strained abdominal muscle — and
rushed for 130 yards on 21 carries in a lit-

tle over a half.

West’s running, a dominating Panther
presence in the trenches, and a successful
passing attack sealed a 30-23 Pitt victory

‘ over Big East front—runner Virginia Tech.
The win ensures Pitt’s ﬁrst ﬁve-win sea-

Illinois State hammers Panther hoops

Eric Mosley

Staff Wrlter

Unlike the Pitt football
team, the men’s basketball team
failed to upset a nationally
ranked squad on Saturday.

Rather, it was pounded by
the 24th-ranked Illinois State
Redbirds, 87-65, in the
Panthers’ ﬁrst road game of the
season. ,

Prior to the game,
Pittsburgh Head Coach Ralph
Willard was concerned about
how his young, inexperienced
Panthers would fare on the road
against a Top 25 team. But the
game against the Redbirds
came at the wrong time.

Illinois State was coming
oil’ a loss to Wisconsin earlier in

the week In addition to that, the
Redbirds were primed for the
return of their top point guard,
Jamar Smiley.

Smiley played his ﬁrst
game after serving a suspension
for allegedly stealing a car. He
scored only four points, but
dished out 14 assists. Most of

his passes went to teammate

Rico Hill, who scored 22 points
and grabbed 14 rebounds.

The Panthers hung with
the Redbirds for the ﬁrst ﬁve
minutes of the game, and they
even led 12-9 at one point.
However, Illinois State went on
a 16-point run to blow the game
open, taking an undermanned
Pitt team out of the game.

“I called two 20-second
timeouts and I prayed for the

TV timeout during that run,”
Willard said “They just didn’t
make a mistake; They just kept
banging three’s on us.”

The Panthers were playing
with only seven scholarship
players, giving them a huge dis-
advantage going into the game.
Freshman guard Ricardo Greer,
who had played more like an
upperclassman than a freshman
in earlier action, scored seven
points but had eight tumovers.

“Greer tried to do too

9 much,” Willard said. “It was the

ﬁrst game on the road for the
freshmen, and the turnovers are
going to happen because we are
so darn young. He’s going to be
a very good player, but he’s
going to have nights like this.
He’s just got to go back and

watch the ﬁlm and go forward

from there.”

The Redbirds puzzled the
Panthers with their zone
defense, forcing numerous
turnovers —— turnovers that cre-
ated many points in transition.

“The zone really hurt us,”
Willard said “They also made
some transition three’s that just
killed us.”

lllinoisState shot 48 per-
cent overall and 39 percent
from three-point territory. The
Redbirds also did a goodjob of
containing Vonteego
Cummings. The junior Pitt
standout did score a team-high
21 points, but most of those
points came in the second half.

From sideline to spotlight: West returns to rescue Panthers

Geoff Moak

Staff Wrlter

The West Coast offense became the
Wild, Wild West offense — at least for
one game.

Pittsburgh running back Billy West,
who has languished on the bench for
much of this season,’ returned as the
Panthers’ ﬁrst—.stn'ng running back when
Dwayne Schulters, who had the job for
most of the season, left Saturday’s game
with a strained abdominal muscle.

It turned out to be tough luck for
Schulters, but things couldn’t have been
any more perfect for West.

The story of West’s ﬁve years here
has been more public than any other
player’s in recent memory. This season
has been particularly hard.on the senior:
He has been criticized and has lost play-
ing time for simply doing what so many
people have said is the right thing to do.

He put academics ahead of football.

He lost the starting running back
position primarily because he has missed
practices all season in order to attend
classes.

But on Senior Day, in his ﬁnal home
game against the national1y—ranked
Virginia Tech Hokies, West returned to
the gridiron spotlight with 21 carries for
130 yards. The performance moved him
past Curtis Martin into ﬁfth place on
Pitt’s all-time rushing yardage list. West

ﬁgures he will get the 31 more yards
needed for fourth place during next
weeks game against West Virginia.

But despite the individual honors,
West said the best part of the game was
the 30-23 win.

“It wasn’t the yards,” said West. “It
was beating a Virginia Tech team that we
haven’t beaten since I’ve been here.
Ending [my home career] on a winning
note meant a lot to me.”

It was largely the strength of West’s
performance that won the game for the
Panthers, according to Pitt Head Coach
Walt Harris.

“Today, [West] was the difference,”
said Harris. “Here’s a guy that worked his
butt off last summer. The guy has some
special qualities. It’s a great example of
the kind of character he is.”

Even quarterback Pete Gonzalez,
whose own 314-yard, four—touchdown
performance was nothing to sneeze at,
recognized that the game belonged to
West.

“I’ve seen Billy play for ﬁve years
now. He is my leader. He’s the kind of
guy I look up to because he’s had a lot of
adversity this year,” Gonzalez said.
“Today he went out and proved that he’s

one of the best.” .. .

Just like the great players alway
seem to do, West saved his best for the
end of the game.

with the canies you get in a rhythm,”
West said. “Every running back gets bet-

I try to take pride in.”

With 3:33 left in the third quarter, the
Hokies returned a fumble for a touch-
down to cut Pitt’s lead to two points. The
Panthers started the next drive from their
own 18-yard line. West personally led
Pitt . out of its own territory by rushing
seven times for 35 yards on the drive and
setting up one of Gonzalez’s touchdown
passes.

The Hokies scored a touchdown with

three minutes left in the game to pull

the ensuing kickoff to their own 26.
West, however, was primarily
responsible for putting the game out of
reach for the Hokies. West ran the
ball on Pitt’s next four plays —— gaining
27 yards. More importantly, he ran 1:07
off the clock which forced Virginia Tech
to spend all three of its timeouts in the
process. On the ﬁfth play, Gonzalez
threw a crucial ﬁrst-down pass to Andy

Molinaro that sealed the victory for West

and the Panthers.

But Pitt’s best outing of the year had a
dubious beginning. The Panthers’ ﬁrst ﬁve

At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, the

On the Hokies next possession, three
running plays ended up just an inch short
of a first down. Kibble boomed a 66-yard
punt far over Jenkins’ head for a Pitt touch-
back.

The teams traded unsuccessful drives
in their next possessions, but Gonzalez
would hit Murphy for a touchdown just
before the half ended to give Pitt a 9-6 lead
at the break.

Pitt’s second possession after halftime
started at its 42. After a false start sent Pitt
back ﬁve yards, West zigzagged his way
for 16 yards and a ﬁrst down. Three plays
later, on a second and 13, Gonzalez hit

minute, nine-play, 67-yard drive, trimming -

the lead to 30-23.

Pitt took over after a short kickoff but
stalled after a quick Billy West ﬁrst down.
After two plays and a penalty netted three
yards, the Panthers were faced with a third-
and—seven with 1:53 remaining.

Instead of going back to the ground,
Gonzalez connected with Molinaro for a
29-yard gain to seal the contest.

“I told Pete in the huddle that if he was
playing me tight I would run the fade. He
was and Pete threw a nice pass that I was
lucky enough to catch,” said Molinaro.

 M N FROM PAGE 8
had three wins, half of the number
required to qualify us for that elusive “B”
word.

Then Pitt lost four of ﬁve and the
less-loyal fans abandoned ship, the season
was lost as far as they were concerned.

Notre Dame beat us. That’s it.

We had Temple, Boston College, and
Syracuse beat, but because of a few
unlucky breaks and a little inexperience,
Pitt was 4-5 when it could just as easily
have been 7-2.

Do you think Harris, the same coach
that chiseled his players into the best
shape of any team in football, would have
the team focused on anything but winning
out the final two games and qualifying for
the postseason?

They could have felt sorry for them-
selves and focused on the “could haves”
and “should haves” —— on what this sea-
son almost was. Instead, they sucked it up

and ﬂat-out beat the 15th-ranked team in I

the country.

Now the entire season comes down to
the last game at West Virginia. It’s simple.
IfPitt wins, we go to a bowl (probably the
Carquest bowl in Sunny Miami). If we
lose, we don’t.

Winning in Hillbilly Land is always
tough, but Pitt has a better chance of win-
ning than most people think.

Yeah, WVU has been ranked for most
of the year, but the hicks from
Morgantown have been overachieving.
The Mountaineers are coming off a loss to
Notre Dame, and with Pitt having every-
thing to gain and nothing to lose, the
Panthers will be fired up.

And this week, while the Panthers are
practicing hard, unconﬁrmed reports say
the West Virginia players will be racing
their John Deeres and watching
Deliverance. 0

Senior center Farrah Woods
pushed the Pittsburgh Panthers to a
62-44 victory over the Robert Morris
Colonials Friday night, leading the
team in both scoring and attitude.

Woods scored 15 points, regis-
tered five fouls, and started the
evening’s festivities for the
Panthers, draining the night’s first
bucket less than two minutes into the
event. '

The two teams battled for the
first few minutes before junior Pitt
forward Kortni Webb sank two free
throws with 12:45 left in the first
half to give the Panthers the lead for
the remainder of the night.

The Colonials answered with
8:43 left in the half, scoring to put
themselves within one point of the
Lady Panthers, but Woods brought
the team back by firing a quick
jumper.

The next three scores were all in
favor of the Lady Panthers, as
juniors guard LaTonya Blanton, for-
ward Alecia Balich and Webb put
points up for the Panthers.

Robert Morris again rallied late

THE PITT NEWS

Woods leads Panthers lo season-opening victory

in the first half to put themselves
within six points of the lead with six
minutes to go, but the Panthers held
on to their lead, ending the half at
30-18.

Pittsburgh came out strong in the
second half, scoring three baskets in
the first two minutes of play. Webb,
junior forward Nicole Whitworth
and sophomore forward McKenzie
Krueger were the Panther contribu-
tors.

With 12:49 to go in the game,
Panther freshman guard Monique
Toney got a steal for Pittsburgh, and
teammate and fellow freshman

Rasheedah Akram turned it into two A

Panther points. She followed by
adding a free throw, which put the
Panthers up, 43-31.

Akram ended the evening 12
minutes later with the game’s final

shot, putting the Panthers’ final

score at 62.
Overall, the Lady Panthers were

very successful in their regular-sea-

son opener. Woods scored 15 points
for Pittsburgh before fouling out in
the game’s final five minutes.
Akram’s 10 came in second, and
Webb came next with nine.

On the boards for the night,

Woods contributed five offensive
and five defensive rebounds. Toney
recorded five defensive rebounds
and one on offense for the Lady
Panthers. . ,

This meeting between the Lady
Panthers and the Colonials of Robert
Morris College was the fourteenth
match-up of the cross-town rivalry.
The Panthers have never lost to
Robert Morris; the series record now
stands at 14-0.

The win over the Colonials came
without two key Panthers in the
starting lineup. Senior captain Latia
Howard and junior Gina Montesano
both missed the contest with’
injuries, but Woods, Webb and com-
pany stepped in to give the Panthers
a 1-0 season record.

Over Thanksgiving break, the
Lady Panthers will continue their
homestand, . taking on St. Francis
College on Nov. 25 and then hosting
the Pittsburgh Tournament on Nov.
29 and 30 at Fitzgerald Field House.

In the tournament, Pittsburgh
will open the tournament playing
Morgan State, and depending on the
outcome, will finish by playing
either the University of Richmond or
Lamar University.
