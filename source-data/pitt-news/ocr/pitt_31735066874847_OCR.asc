Convocation

For Religion-In—Life Week

By JOAN THOMAS

Wilmina Rowland addressed the Monday Convocation
gathering in the Commons Room as a group of “students

full. of anxiety and part of a lonely crowd.” She ofiicially
opened this year’s Religion-in-Life program.

The initial speaker of the three day schedule stated
that the Religion-in—Life activities served as an occasion for
students to face their eternal chaos and, to discover the mean-
ing of life, perchance glimpsing the meaning of the universe.

Miss Rowland attributed our estrangement from God
as the root of alienation of ourselves and of others. She as-
serted that alienation from ourselves was a self-hate, and

_not a

self-love, problem, and
that we must overcome contempt
for ourselves before we can over-
come contempt for others.

Theory Accented/_

*A The Convocation speaker ac-
cented the theory that “we must
accept the fact that we are ac-
cepted.” ‘

h She said that we are struck
by God’s grace ,when we are‘
“in great pain and restlessness,
as we go through an ‘empty,
meaningless life, when our lack
of direction has become intol-
erable, or through another per-
son who accepts us when we
cannot accept ourselves.”

‘Miss Rowland‘ stated that no
religious suppositions are needed
for the simple act of acceptance
that may mean the beginning. of
a new life. i

She believes that when we are
accepted we will “feel re-united
with life, and that all life be-
longs to God.”

Alienation Realized

The speaker told the‘congrega-
tion that when they become grac-
ed they will realize the alienation‘
of freedom and unity from na-
tional life, and in international
understanding,‘ sex problems in

relationship to love and marriage,‘

and family living. ,
Miss Rowland stated that as
humans we are constantly disap-
_point ourselves, and feeling the_
pain of human life. She be-
lieves that we ‘still don’t do

. the things we want to do, and

do the things we don’t want to
do.”

She sees our life as a pattern
of acceptance, trying, trying
again, suffering, ‘and death.

Miss Rowland closed the Con-

vocation by stating that as. stu-

dents we can “discover that we
can accept others and our re-
sponsibility for them and our
world.”

In ‘introducing the speaker

for the nihth annual Religion-

in‘-Life Wek, Chairman Alice

Smolkovich, stated that stu-

SC._”Moves to Integrate” Women
In New Political Party System

Motion Passed 13-4: Based’ On Report

Showing Women In Favor of System
By AL LEFFLER ’ ~

Student Congress set in motion the proposal to integrate
women in to the present political party setup after a discus-
sion at their regular meeting last Monday that involved SC

members and the WSGA commission.

Theproposal stems from the report of Betty Ann Ybung’s
committee, completed this vsfeek, based on a poll of women
that favored the integration. The motion-to approved her

report, tabled from last week’s meeting, was passed, 13-4.
Although the poll wasn’t completed until this week,

the results were in about the same ‘ratio as they were in
the interim reportlast week, 237-70. Alice Smolkovich
commented. on the validity of such a poll, since the relia-
bility has been questioned several times in the last few

weeks. ‘

Led by Miss Smolkovich and
Marlene Bloomenthal, the WSGA
members based their arguments
on the rights of student govern-
ment to legislate for the student.
Since WSGA did not vote on the
proposal on the premise that they
did not have the right, they felt,
that the solons should follow the
same policy.

But Paul Petro stood in favor
of interation, since, he opined, the
woman have, in the past, re-
ceived unofficial support from
the men’s parties and that the

move would only bring this cor-
relation into the open.’
Recalling Charles Elliot's an-
alogy of Crime Inc., during the
discussion of -men's political par-
ties, Nancy Jones said that in-
stead of legalizing this evil, a
study should be made- to elim-

mate it completely.

,President Emil Herman then
limited ‘the discussion to ten
minutes and agreed to recog-
nize only five more speakers.
Included among the last speak-
ers lwas Bob Sedler who open-
ed» with a quote from Shake-
speare -“This is much ado about
nothing.” “This not a ques-
tion of integration, but rather
of “attachment,” he said, fol-
lowing Petro’s line of reason-
ing. The 13-4 affirmative vote
followed. .
-During the standing commit-

reports, S t a n Greenﬁeld,
chaiﬁman of appointments, an-
nounced the choice of Yale Ros-
enstein' as overall chairman of

Professor’s Wife Studies

Spanish Tutor,

By BARBARA CHERINGTON O--—-—--—

There’s never a dull moment
for Mrs. Maria Fluharty, who
teaches Spanish, takes three,
courses at Pitt, and is married‘
to a Pitt political science pro-§
fessor. }

. A Spanish conversational-'
ist, Mrs. Fluharty is originally
from Medellin in Bogata, Co-f
lumbia, South America. She
graduated with a Bachelor of»
Arts degree from the Colegio'

de Maria Auxidiadora in Co-; 

lumbia, and ‘now conducts
classes in beginning Spanish.

She enjoys her classes and ﬁnds
that the students “catch on” easily
to the pronunciation and learn the
grammar quickly. In one of her
talks, Mrs. Fluharty demonstrated
the process of putting on a poncho,
Spanish blanket-like garment. ,The
course was helpful, Mrs: Fluharty
claimed, in teaching her to become
at h_ome with the English language
as ’ well as in stressing public
speaking.

Liked Lear

In addition to speech, Mrs. Flu-
harty finds her history of Europe
and English literature courses in-
teresting. She especially liked
studying King ‘Lear last term.

From l933'to 1943, Mrs. Flu-
harty worked for the Columbia
Foreign Service in New York
City, as a secretary to Colom-
bia’s consuls to the United
States.

Then for about ﬁve years, after
1945 the Fluhartys both taught at
Steubenville College, Ohio. Mr.
Fluharty commuted to Pitt regu-
larly to take classes.

Mrs. Fluharty studied beginning
French, and, since her husband

well as English and Spanish, she
could “practice her pronunciation
on him” to see if: her accent was
correct.

Favors Languages in Lower Grades

The versatile teacher, student,‘
and wife is such a charming per-
son that a reporter forgets about
interviewing her and drifts into
an informal chat about events in
and out of Pitt. I .

On the subject of incorporating
foreign language instruction in the
elementary schools, Mrs. Fluharty
strongly favors the idea. She be-
lieves that the younger the stu-
dents are, the easier it is for them
to “pick up” another language.

If, while a child is learning the
fundamentals of his native tongue,
he could hear words of one or two
other languages, he would greatly
beneﬁt, Mrs. Fluharty says.

Of course, nothing speeds learn-
lng a language more than travel-
ing in the area whose language he
is studying, the Spanish teacher

agrees. She visited England and
France in 1931 and ’32.

.Now, in the two years that Mrs.
Fluharty has been at Pitt she has
never had _ a dull moment. She
likes the courses she is teaching
and taking. In fact Pitt as a whole
agrees with her.

Drama to Open

At Playhouse;

Pittsburgh Playhouse will pres-
ent'the ﬁrst Pittsburgh showing of
the Broadway drama, “The Cruci-
ble”, at the Craft Ave. Theater,
beginning this Thursday and run-
ning through Apr. 2.

“The Crucible”, the first play
by Arthur Miller since his Pul-
itzer-Prize winning “Death of a
Salesman”, concerns the witch-
craft trials in Salem, Mass., in
1692.

Directed by.Frederick Burleigh,
with settings by Chandler Potter,
the play stars George Peppard as
the Colonial Farmer John Proctor,
whose demand for justice during
the‘ mass hysteria of the witch
hunts aroused the hostility of the
persecutors.

Patti Littell will play the role
of Elizabeth Proctor, his°wife, who
is unjustly accused of witchcraft.
Harry Lantz will play the role of
the deputy governor.

SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 2

Though this column is intended solely as a vehicle for well-\
tempered drollery, the makers of Philip Morris havefagreed to.
let me use this space from time to time for a short lesson in
science. They are the most decent and obliging of men, the

  

makers of Philip Morris, as one would guess from sampling _

their product. Only from bounteous hearts could come such a
pleasurable cigarette-so felicitously blended, so gratifying to
the taste, so soothing to the psyche. And, as though bringing
you the most agreeable cigarette on the market were not enough,
the makers of Philip Morris have enclosed their wares in the

Snap-Open Pack, an ingeniously contrived wrapping that yields .

up its treasure without loss of time or cuticle. And, ﬁnally,
this paragon of cigarettes, wrapped in the paragon of packages,
can be had in kin_g—size or regular, as your taste dictates. Who
can resist such a winning combination? Not I.

A few weeks ago in this column we had a brief lesson in chem-
istry. Today we take up another attractive science-medicine.
Medicine was invented in 1066 by a Greek named Hippocrates.
He soon attracted around him a group of devoted disciples whom
he called “doctors”. The reason he called them “doctors” was
that they sat around a dock all day. Some ﬁshed, some just
dozed in the noonday sun. In truth, there was little else for them
to do, because disease was not invented until 1492. ' _ -
After that doctors became very busy, but, it must be reported,‘
their, knowledge of medicine was lamentably meagre. They
knew only one treatment-a change of climate. For example, a
French doctor would send all his ‘patients to Switzerland; a
Swiss doctor,.on the other hand, would send all’his patients/co
France. By 1789 the entire population of France was living in
Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the

, Black Tom Explosion.

Not until 1924 did medicine, as We know it, come into being.
In that year in the little Bavarian village of Pago-Page an
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot
water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son
Lydia,‘disguised as alinotype, smuggled the hot water bottle
out of the country. He called on Florence Nightingale in London
but was told by her housekeeper, with some asperity, that Miss,
Nightingale had died in 1910. Lydia muttered something and,
disguised as a feather boa, made his way to America, where he
invented the blood stream. ’

Medicine, as it ‘is taught at your very own college, can be divided
roughly into two classiﬁcations. There is internal medicine,
which is the treatment of internes, and external medicine, which

Diseases also fall into two broad categories.-—-chronic and

acute. Chronic disease, is of course, inﬂammation of the chron, ‘

which -can be mighty painful, believe you me! Last summer my
cousin Haskell was stricken with a‘ chron attack while out pick-
ing up tinfoil, and it was months before the wretched boy could
straighten up. In fact, even after he was cured, Haskell con-
tinued to walk around bent over double. This went on for some
weeks before Dr. Caligari, the lovable old country practitioner
who treats Haskell, discovered that Haskell had his pants but-
toned to his vest. '

Two years ago Haskell had Addison’s disease. (Addison,
curiously enough, had Haskell’s.) Poor Haskell catches every-
thing that comes along. Lovable old Dr. Caligari once said to-

him, “Son, I guess you are what they call a natural born catcher." -I

“The joke is on you, Doc,” replied Haskell. “I ‘am a third
baseman.” He thereupon fell into such a ﬁt of giggling that the
doctor had to put him under sedation, where he is to this day.

But I digress. We were discussing medicine. I have now told
you all I can; the rest is up to you. Go over to your medical
school and poke around. Bring popcorn and watch an operation.
Fiddle with the X—ray machines. Contribute to the bone bank
. . . And, remember, medicine can be fun! -

 An sllnans werable Question

How canlyou become the kind of person who does not
ask, “What can I expect to get out of religion?” This was
one of the questions raised at the convocation which launch-

» ed Religion-In-Life week last Monday, and is worthy of

more than a passing glance. - ' t
This question touches every phase of the person’s life,

not being limited to that one hour each Sunday during

whichhe ostentatiously descends on his church. ,, O
The‘: same person will ask, “What can I expect to get

out of this course?”, or “What can I expect to get out of

‘this job?” With an attitude such as this a person may Well

expecttno returns from either a course or_a job and cer-
tainly no understanding of religion. \ p

The time honored maxim which proclaims that a man
will gain only as he himself searches, may well be applied

‘here. But the question should never have been asked in

the ﬁrst place. The very utterance of such a query shows

.a_ glittering ignorance of self on behalf of the questioner.

How can any man ask this of another and expect’, an ac-
curate answer? ‘ -, x

Miss Rowland, the convocation speaker, voiced a belief
which adequately ﬁlls this void. She stated that we must
“believe in the worth of a single man.” The roots of such
a belief are founded in each of us and must ﬁrst result in
apbelief in ourselves. -

Miss Rowland went on to state that, “estrangement from
Godis the root of estrangement from ourselves and from
others.” Here we are confronted with what at times appear
to?be the impassable boundries between the various reli-

- gious beliefs and doctrines. If each religion could be viewed

in the very basic light of its conception these “impassable”

boundries would appear as they really are; fences erected ..

in the too narrow minds of men.

To level these fences would seem to be ahurculean,

task. Actually it is not, but the ﬁrst step is a difficult one.
It consists of a knowledge of self, a knowledge which cannot
be gained as long as a man asks, “What can I expect to

, ‘get out of religion?’-’

(Ed1'.to'r’s note: *This is the ﬁnal column in a
series dealing with Religion-In-Life week and its
theme, “Accent On What Is Vital.”)
By Jim Deweese ,

No man can tell another what he should con-
sider most vital. No man can tell you what you
should deem most important to yourself-. But

- every man whom you meet, every incident which’

touches your life, should raise within you that
question, the answer to which
many never ﬁnd. “What is most
vital tome?” \ I
Ideals are very ﬁne things to
have, biit when the proverbial
chips are down will you follow
to those ideals, or cast them aside
' in favor of saving yourself? The ,
myriad thoughts and ideas which
jostle each other in a ceaseless
struggle for recognition within i
the mind of a man are unknown to all save that
man and a higher power, if‘ you so believe. But
what single focus will obliterate that kaliedescope
“on the instant when the heart within that man
beats no more? '

A Thousand Moments

Each day brings to man a thousand moments
when one thing tops the, pinnacle of importance.
On a given morning the act of getting to work on
time may thrust aside all else. .He, will dismiss
breakfast, drive at reckless speeds, and be abrupt
and inconsiderate in his actions, all borne of his

desire to be in a certain place at a speciﬁed time. ‘

A student at the University may ﬁnd his thoughts
constantly shifting their attention as hegoes from
class toclass, from tuck shop to library.’ Within a
single’ class period the focus of his thoughts may
change a hundred times.

Imagine yourself taking a three,hour examina-

tion in a history course. With the completion of
each question a new line of-thought is pushed for-
ward, not t-o be denied until the problem has been
solved. For the moment, the answer to that ques-
tion might be termed as the thing most vital to
you. V T .
Living Contradictions , -

Some consider man’s greatest failingpto be this
which causes him to live from one moment to the
next, seldom lo-oking over. his shoulder, almost.

never seeing what is ahead. Yetlthere are men.

 

   
  
   
  
 
       

living today who contradict such critics.

Dr.’ Albert Schwietzer lives in an obscure part
of the African jungle ministering to lepers, teach-
ing the ignorant, ‘and waging a constant battle
with the diseases which plague the natives of that
region. Dr. Schweitzer. could haye been inde-

pendently wealtlqy and lived in what our society
. holds as the ﬁnest manner. 
‘Herbert Hoover, who is independently wealthy,

was President of the United. States in what was
perhaps the most thanklessterm of oﬁice ever held.

WA vast number of people hated him for the job he
‘ was doing. Many still do. He could have been living
in retirement‘ with all the material. wealth that a .

man can possess.
A Broken Man , *

General Billy Mitchell and Colonel Charles Lind-
berg were both cognizant of a future which the
people of their country refused to acknowledge.
They both knew that an empending war hung over
the United tates, and that this country was not pre-
pared. Their crusaders were tragic in import.
Theywere called war mongers and facists. Lind-
berg, who a few short years before had gained
world acclaim ‘for his solo ﬂight across the At-
lantic, was almost ruined. Mitchell, who had of-
fered his life for his country many times, was
given a dishonorable discharge and died, a broken
man. ’

The fact that the world is only now beginning
to realize what these men gave to all others is
signiﬁcant in that it" holds, for‘ all to see, an un-
selﬁshness which is undeniable and a love which

i

p is widely encompassing.

They Knew and Acted

If it were possible to pose this question to each
of these men it is quite probable, that four differ-

ent answerslwould result. Or perahps_ they would

offer no answer at all.‘ But answer or no, the fact
remains that they knew what was needed and thus
what was most vital to them.

Emerson had a term for it. “A man of thought
is willing to die, willing to live; I suppose be-
cause he has seen the thread on which the beads
are strung, and perceived that it reaches up and
down, existing quite independently of the present
illusions. A man of affairs is afraid to die, is~.pes-

. tered with terrors, because he has not this vision,

andiis the victim of those who have moulded the
religious ‘doctrines into some neat and plausible
system for household use.”

By GIQNE AROMATORIO .

It seems like only yesterday that the Panther footballers
stashed away their grid togs for the winter but already the
Stadium custodians are dusting off the helmets and unpack-
ingthe shoulder pads, readying for spring practice.

According, to Head Coach John Michelosen, the spring
drills are tentatively slated to start sometime in the latter

part of March and should
weather permitting. 
The reason for starting the
‘spring work earlier than usual
this year is, “To give the play-
ers a chance to £0 01“? 1'01‘ base‘
ball or track
if they want
to,” st a t e d
Miehelosen.
Since "the fin-
ish of last sea-
son, the grid-
ders. have been

shape playing a
lot of handball
and basketball.
The g o o d’:
turnout during ,
the off—season caused the Pan-
ther mentor to comment,, “The
boys have been working out
pretty faithfuly.”

 

Mlchelosen ,

On the turf to help Michelosenk

and his staff when drills start will
be the twolnew additions to the

~ coaching ranks, Jack Wiley and

Vic Fusia. Even though they both

: tarrived only last Monday, the as-

sistant tutors were out on the
road the next day recruiting foot-

_ ball talent.

Since theimarrival, Wiley and
Fusia have been dividing their
time between ‘interviewing grid
prospects and acquainting
themselves with the present
Panthermen. ‘
‘Michelosen a n n o u n c e d last-

Monday that for the present he
would not appoint a replacement
to fill the post of graduate as-
sistafit just recently vacated by
Carl DePasqua. DePasqua depart-

(Women, That Is)
7 Getting of! to a good start in
their ﬁrst intercollegiate basket-
ball game, the Pitt Pantherettes
defeated their neighbors, Carnegie
Tech, 43-40, in a tough battle
Thursday night at the Tartans
home court.

Pitt had the lead throughout the
ﬂrst.quarter, but at halftime, Tech
was leading 20-16‘. The end of the
third quarter showed the score
tied up at 29 apiece.

Stealing the spotlight in. the
game, was the excellent teamwork
of the Pitt guards. Throughout the
game, the defensive players led by
AnniBlackmon, kept the opposing
team on their toes as Cathy Vla-
hos, Melena Ivanovich and Janice
McConnell got the majority-:..of the
rebounds and interceptions.

The ﬁnal quarter was the de-
eiding point in the game as the
Pitt females started scoring fast.
Pitt was led to victory by Tina
Krewasky; a 5’ 9” freshman, who
scored 21 points. Backing her up
in the forward positions were
IrenetBrodak, Pat Shearn and
Bunny Reingold.

Year-Old Crown

Coach Rex Peery’s hungry Pan-

liking over the weeked as they
closed out the 1955 campaign with
a hard-earned 19-8 triumph over
Penn State.

It was the seventh consecutive
dual win for the Blue and Gold
who ended the season with an
overall mark of 9-2.

By AL PELAEZ

An (unprecedented fourth con-
secutive Eastern swimming cham-
pionship will be the objective for
Ben Grady’s tankers this Friday
and Saturday at the Rutgers Uni-
versity pool.

The locals retired the James H.
Reilly trophy when they won their
third straight title last year and
will be out to get a ﬁrm hold on
the new trophy.

In the way of a warmup for the
Easterns, the mermen overpower-
ed a strong Rutgers team, 46-38,
at the Pittsburgh Athletic Associa-
tion pool last Saturday night.

Skip Monsein, Roy Kaupe, and
Hank Zentgraf started the locals

  

lay and they were never headed.
Jim Zur_cher and Bill Furrer then
took ﬁrst and second, respectively,
in the 220-yard freestyle to
further increase the lead. .
Rutgers took the ﬁrst two places
in the 50-yard freestyle but Warne

it ‘Bring. On  
The Girls

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

While talk- of football may not be in season, a plan to
beneﬁt students who would like to take their wives or
“dates” to football games is always in season, and such a
formula is in the air with a possibility that it will be en-
acted by next fall. V

Right now, this plan is only in the preliminary discus-
sion stagebut it looks to have a good chance of becoming
an actuality. Assistant Dean of Men Jack Hardman has in-
vestigated the matter during the past few months at other
schools where wives and “dates” were permitted under vari-
ous schemes. . ‘

One of the better plans exists at the University of
_Texas where wife tickets are available at reduced
season rates and a certain allotment each game is also

I set aside for non-student * 1-
“date” tickets which are '
distributed by means of
a raffle: ’ “ ~ * A

The basic idea of this plan
is also the one that is being
considered for Pitt. -Of course,
as Graduate Manager Frank
Carver says, “There are still
many operational diﬁiculties

Hardman which have to be worked out.” Carver

Carver stressed that the plan has been talked over in
meetings with Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, Ticket Man-
ager Kenny George, Hardman, and himself but that is the
extent. He said that the necessary channels—the Treasurer’s
ofﬁce and the Athletic Committee-—will be ‘spoken to after
all the ironing-out details have been gone over.

These two bodies are the people thatwwill have the
ﬁnal say and as Carver says “Sentiment looks good but
there are plenty ofloose ends to -be cleared up.”

As to the wife’s ticket, students would simply have to
prove they are married and then would be able to buy one
reduced rate season ticket. In the “date” allotment, Student
Congress or’, some similar organization would conduct a
raﬁle in which students would obtain a “date” ticket for
one home game at a lower rate. .

These plans, though, are still tentative but if everything
Works out as planned, some type of arrangement will be -set

w

I enough to win “two, or maybe

fend his 220 and 44.0-yard free-0

along-range possibility. but deﬁnitely one that should begin
operation by this fall. .

Last season, evening school students had a reduced”sea-
son_ ducat for themselves‘ and wives and this was one of the
major factors in the plan since these students supported the
idea enthusiastically. - '

Here’s hoping that. the plan passes because it’s always

great to take along a girl to a rah-rah college football game. I
