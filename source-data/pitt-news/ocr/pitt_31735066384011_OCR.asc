Posvar Tells Senate

ByMARKCELENDER
‘Pitt News Staff Writer

Although the State Legislature is
unable to ﬁnance $300 million in
non-preferred appropriations, and
Pitt will be borrowing up to $5
million by the end of the month,
Chancellor Posvar said there’s “no
need for despair, ’ ’ at the University
Senate Council meeting Monday.

“We’ve taken the public
approach to help our situation and
it’s having a beneﬁcial effect,”
Posvar said. “All the media are
helping with positive pressure

?a.vard the legislators and we hope

for continued support.”
Answering a hypothetical ques-
tion concerning Pitt's closure due to
the lack of funds, Posvar said: “We
don’t expect the University to close
and aren’t planning for it. It would
mean an unprecedented closure of
Pennsylvania higher education and
would mean the state’s legislators
were incompetent to continue
higher education in the state.”
Although Posvar had neither

‘favorable nor unfavorable news to

report from Harrisburg on the
appropriation decision, he believes
Pitt’s campaign for public support is
ping considerably.
“Momentum is going now.

ouncil ‘Not to Despair“

Student support along with faculty
support has been great. Pitt is
getting nationwide sympathy and it
isn’t a very positive reflection on the
image of the Pennsylvania legis-
lature,” Posvar said.

The Chancellor feels there are
some false impressions the public
has about the whole situation,
including the misconception that
the appropriation is an educational
tax and somehow the higher
education people have worked-the
whole thing out with the Governor
to increase the appropriation.

The House has passed the
appropriation and the Senate is
waiting to take action, but Posvar
said, “the higher education issue
has turned to more of a political
ploy.” '

“Ironically, some legislators are
against educational appropriations,
which is a Neanderthal position,”
Posvar said. And some feel enough
favors haven’t been done for them.

The president of the .University
Senate Council, Hibberd Kline, is
optimistic about the legislator’s
decision, but is also concerned with
political interests.

“I don’t think the Harrisburg
decision depends solely on higher
education interests,” Kline said-

SGS Cabinet Offers Loan to Pitt;
Trustees Say Thanks, But Decline

Pitt’s Board of Trustees yester-
day officially “thanked” the School
of General Studies Student Cabinet
(SGSSC) for its recent proposal to
lend the University $30,000 on an
interest-free basis, although it was
not empowered to accept the loan.

At its last meeting, the Board of
Trustees approved a blanket

Rosenberg Denies Bias Claim

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS)
Dean Jerome Rosenberg yesterday
denied a recent charge that a
University report calls for the ﬁring
of Slavic department faculty
members of Slavic descent.

The allegation, leveled a week
a former instructor in the

FR. IVAN DORNIC

Slavic department, centered on an
external_evaluation of the depart-
ment that, he claimed, recommend-
ed Pitt ﬁre instructors of Slavic
origin and prevent others from
being hired.

Rosenberg termed the charges

(“@ensense...not just true.” The
" *5‘ 'al

uative report, made in 1973 by
two educators from Cornell and
Columbia universities, did not

‘ recommend Pitt ﬁre Slavic. in-
structors pof Slavic descentﬁ

Rosenberg said, but it suggested in
part that the scope of the
department be broadened as to the
area of western literature in order to
“prevent the University from
appearing parochia .”

Rosenberg said such external
evaluations are common to FAS
departments, adding that the Slavic
department report was “balanced”
and the evaluators “liked some
things in the department and also

“made recommendations” for

improvement.

“‘The Gibian-Mathewson report
was comprehensive...with the sort
ofthings you’d expect in this type of
report,” he said. “We do ask for a
fresh external point of view toward
the department.”

Rosenberg noted the University
was not held to following the
report’s recommendations. ‘ ‘We do

«what makes sense to us,” he said.

The charge that Rosenberg was
implimenting the report was made
by Father Ivan Dornic, a Greek
Orthodox priest at St. Macrina
Church in Monongahela, who last
week resigned from his position as
instructor and lecturer in Pitt’s
Slavic department in protest over
the alleged discrimination.

He also claimed the Gibian-
Mathewson report recommended
that then-acting chairman Nikolai
Poltoratzky be forced to resign and
to be replaced with a person not of
Slavic descent. '

Poltoratzky, currently a professor
inithepdepartment, last night did not

confirm that he was forced to resign
as department chairman, but
added: “The situation was compli-
cated, but under the circumstances,
I thought it best to submit my
resignation.” _
Rosenberg said the decision to
succeed P__oltoratzky with associate
professor Jane Harris in 1975 was
based on her qualiﬁcations and not

Slavic descent.

“Our faculty is chosen from a
national pool,” Rosenberg said.
“We’re'not restricted” in terms of
geography- _

Harris, asked to comment on the
allegations, noted that 14 of 16
faculty members currently in the
Slavic department are of Slavic
descent. “Ethnic bias certainly

authorization for the University to
borrow up to $30 million, although it
does not have to approve each loan
individually. There is no indication
from the Administration that it will
accept the loan from the School of
General Studies.

The university expects to borrow
over $5 million for its October
expenditures. ’

In a letter to Chancellor Posvar
last week, SGSSC stated, “While
fully realizing that the sum of
$30,000 is minute compared to the
vast amounts of loans the University
has recently made, we, the Student
Cabinet of the School of General
Studies submit for approval this
proposal.” ‘

olibrciry Vandalism Continues

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Vandalism of Pitt library books
and property is a cyclical problem,
increasing and decreasing through-
out the academic terms, according

-to Sara Rowley, Coordinator of

Public Services for Pitt’s libraries.

“The pressure of the term does it.
We encounter most of our problems
just before and during ﬁnals,”
Rowley said. ~

A “Tattletape” book detection
system, installed at all library exits
in 1975, has substantially reduced

\@.-aok thefts, but mutilation of books

to

 iCHANGE

and periodicals remains a major
problem for library ofﬁcials.

“The loss of books has decreased
sharply, but there is no way we can
prevent the tearing out of pages
from books and magazines,”
Glenora Rossell, director of the
University’s libraries, said.

According to Rossell, it is
impossible to keep a record of the
ﬁnancial losses incurred by library
vandalism. It is difficult, she said,
to determine whether a book was
misplaced or stolen and no price can
be placed on damaged furniture or
books.

It is also difficult, Rossell said, to
estimate the damage costs from
doodling-on chairs, cigarette burns
on furniture, grafﬁti on bathroom
walls and tampering with type-
writer coin boxes.

Theft of handbags and wallets is
another major library problem,
according to Rowley. Signs that
warn students to protect their
valuables while in the library are
often stolen or, are covered with
obscenities.

Graduate students also have
complained that books in their study
carrels are being tampered with.

The stolen book detection sys-
attention of the offending ﬁrm.
the job of Pitt librarians much
easier.

Before the system was installed, I
used to check briefcases and
handbags at the door,” librarian
Rita Dixon said. “You keep a lot
more friends with this security
system.”

Dixon said the alarm is activated
occasionally during a day, but
students rarely attempt to carry
unchecked books through the
security gates.

“Certain makes of briefcases,
handbags or audio-visual equip-
ment sometimes accidently activate
the system,” Dixon said.

Dixon emphasized problems with
students carrying off books are
greatest at the beginning of each
term rather than at the end.

‘, 11iat $30,000 Gesture

The School of General Studies Student Cabinet’s $30,000 gesture to
Pitt was a nice one. Although $30,000 is barely what the University
spends on a decent football trip, the amount is not important (except
to the cabinet, of course, since that is a large part of its revenue).

Night students are not a privileged class at Pitt. SGS is probably
Pitt’s most proﬁtable program. It costs little to educate a part-time
evening student, especially when teaching assistants instruct most
classes.

But the evening student government yesterday made a gesture that
shows night students’ willingness to do more than find a parking
place, attend class and leave Pitt behind. The offer of $30,000 interest-
free loan from cabinet coffers, although not yet accepted by Pitt, goes
a long way in demonstrating the concern of at least some students that
Pitt’s current and future ﬁnances could affect education and life here.

Most students have been surprisingly complacent after assessing
Pitt’s stake in the Harrisburg’s budget battle—if such an assessment
has even been made by many of those who will be most affected in the
end.

The Cabinet’s offer may not go very far in paying Pitt’s bills, if
the loan is ever accepted. but it is a visible and attention-drawing
method of showing student concern. Other student govern
ments»--notably Pitt’s undergraduate student government, which is
in a financial position to make such an offer——wou1d be wise to
consider following the SGS Cabinet’s lead, not only at Pitt but at
other state-related schools.

 

TA ’s Evaluation Request Denied

With the encouragement of my
department chairman and the
instructor of the course for which I
am a teaching fellow, and with the
intention of evaluating and hence
improving my teaching effective-
ness, I today phoned the Office of
Teaching Evaluation to request
them to conduct a survey in my
class.

I was informed that since I do not
have full responsibility for the
course I am associated with, the
computerized analysis of student
opinion will not be provided for me.

I do not know what the budgetary
constraints of the Office of Teaching
Evaluation are, but it is hard to

imagine that the cost of evaluating f

recitation sections would be pro-
hibitively high. Does the University
mean to imply that faculty members
are worth evaluating, but teaching
assistants and teaching fellows are
not?

Legislature. He carries the label of
machine Democrat and he carries it
with pride. It is ironic to note that
in 1963, when Foerster was first
elected Commissioner, he ran
against incumbents who had borne
the machine Democrat label for
many years.

Foerster won the Democratic

primary this year by a landslide,
and based on what he claims was a
pledge from Caliguiri not to oppose
him. anticipated a cakewalk in the
fall. The Foerster campaign now is
putting forth the idea that Foerster
is a man of his word and Caliguiri is
not. That’s nice to know, but it’s
hardly the stuff of earthshaking
campaigns.
. Dick Caliguiri is interim mayor,
having achieved that exalted
position due to the resignations of
former mayor Pete Flaherty and
former City Council President Lou
Mason. Mason could have had
Flaherty’s job if he had been able
to stay on the council. Caliguiri
had'lost to Flaherty for mayor in
1973, even though he ran as the
machine Democrat. What politics
couldn't do for him then. ambition
(Flaherty’s) and illness (Mason's)
did in 1977. Whether Caliguiri
promised not to run for a full term
when he was chosen interim mayor
is open to doubt and completely
irrelevant.

Caliguiri’s campaign is based on
his paving 107 miles of streets this
summer. This issue is popular and
also enables Caliguiri to travel back
and forth more quickly between
rallies. Caliguiri seems to be trying
to ride the Flaherty ooattails, an
interesting development in light of
his previous sharp criticism of Pete.

Both Caliguiri and Foerster seem
to have forgotten that Joe Cosetti is
in the race, but that's okay; most
Republicans have also forgotten it,
or are trying deserately to do so.
Cosetti, a lifelong Democrat, did it

became a Republican when he
realized that was the only open spot
on the ballot. An interesting
sidelight is that city treasurer
Cosetti is running against Caliguiri,
his boss.

Cosetti is running against tax
hikes. That is a fine and popular

idea, except that Foerster and.

Caliguiri also are against tax hikes.
Cosetti claims his anti-tax creden-
tials are better than those of his
opponents because he -was city
treasurer during the Flaherty
regimes that reduced the taxes and
ran the city at a proﬁt. It’s a good
point, unless you happen to believe
that government is not a proﬁt-
making corporation, that city proﬁts
in the long run beneﬁt no one and
that a government should use its

funds for the common good.

So far, with four weeks to go. the
candidates are either talking
irrelevancies or talking past each
other. Oh. there are some other
issues floating around. Foerster
wants to do something about the
state of public education in
Pittsburgh. a very laudable goal,

quick about-face last winter and”

but something the ‘mayor has no
legal authority to do anything
about. Caliguiri is running against
machine politics, conveniently ig-
noring the fact that he was a cog

in that machine until four months
ago. Cosetti is claiming he is the
legitimate heir to the Flaherty
legacy, a claim that may have to be
settled in probate court against a
similar claim by Caliguiri.

We can only hope that things will

improve. Both Foerster and
Caliguiri have long and solid
campaigning records. full of

evidence that they usually face
issues head-on instead of ducking
them. Hopefully. they will start to
do so soon. Cosetti learned his
politics at the knee of Pete
Flaherty. which means that it is
futile to expect him to ever start
dealing with issues. Maybe we will
start hearing from the other two

about how to keep businessesﬁti

the city. how to draw people bac. .
from the suburbs before the central
core dies completely. and how to
make Pittsburgh a better place t
live. I hope so. "

You saunter into class at 5:10
p.m. and slump into the nearest
chair, settling in for a once a week,
two-and-a-half hour class. You’re a

iiege of Arts and Sciences
undergraduate, taking advantage of
a night class in the School of
General Studies. A group of people
walk in behind you; some appear to
be businessmen, working men or
women and housewives.

You might be there for a political
science or an English class, or any of
the other courses also offered in
CAS—-or you may be taking three of
your allowed 12 non-CAS credits in
SGS’s administration of justice
department. _

But whatever you’re there for,
this class is guaranteed to be
different from a usual CAS class,

,,Vou should prepare yourself for
an interesting experience.

The most interesting aspect of
SGS classes is the people. The SGS
students are mostly working men
and women-—-businessmen, house-
wifes, full-time students who make
money during the day to put
themselves through school and
other people with daily commit-
ments that prevent full-time day
attendance.

In one writing class this term, for
example, there is a medical doctor,
a mother of three, several
University secretaries, an
Mégheny Eounty Jail guard, two
 3' students and a high school

working men and women.

   

Not only is there a wide variety of
occupations, but there also is a wide
range of age. The youngest person
in the class is 19, the oldest
approximately 55. Most people are
in their late 20s or 30s. The
professor is about 60.

While most of the students are
writing or English literature majors,
their reasons for going to school
differ immensely. The high school
teacher is interested in teaching
English instead of his present ﬁeld,
French. The Pitt secretary is an

 writer, hoping to make it

big in the literary world. One of the
CAS students is working to get into
law school. The mother is picking up
where she left off some nine years
ago when she got married.

The experiences of the people are
as varied as their occupations.
These experiences often are
incorporated into discussions,
making this aspect of SGS classes
an important advantage to
students.

Stories of working, dealing with
families and friends and budgeting
time to attend school are always

among the stories told in an SGS
discussion. Seldom do CAS
students initiate these types of
discussions in day classes; nor do
they actively participate in them at
night. i

an important part, SGS classes rate
a plus over those in CA5.

Because the maturity level of.
students in SGS is, on the average,
higher than that of CAS students,

classes tend to be less formal. There
is more student-professor inter-
action and discussions often
dominate class time. This is another
aspect of SGS classes that many
consider to be positive.

In general, the quality of teaching
is higher in SGS than in CA5, simply
because the faculty who teach at
night make personal sacriﬁces to do
so and care more about their
students.

Many CAS students emerge from
these classes convinced SGS
students and classes offer many
benefits and advantages to daytime
students.

“Homecoming Kings--A N cw Tradition At Pitt

By JOHN RIGHETTI

Homecoming Week is once again
upon us and Pitt, true to its
tradition. has‘ added something
new. The addition is the establish-
ment of a Homecoming King. The
purpose of creating this position is

I to give equal time and opportunity
to the male undergraduates,
although an underlying reason. no
doubt. is the fear Pitt students,
true to their tradition. will try
something like running a male
undergrad for queen. (lt’s been

; «lone elsewhere, you know.)

rs

lHow do those who have the
honor of going down in history as
Pitt’s first king candidates feel
about it? When interviewed, none
answered. “My favorite color is
blue and I’m going into speech
pathology to help people.”

Peter Butch. a senior chemistry
major, managing editor of The Pitt
News and president of Phi Delta
Theta. was sponsored by The Pitt
News. Why did he run?

“I did it on a lark—maybe that
way I’d get a date for the
Homecoming formal,” Butch
joked.

He thinks the king concept might

 ave risen out of the equal rights
W‘ riiovement. to give men equal time



" ,_ .,. .......v-.--,....-

in the festivities and to direct
Homecoming voting away from the
sexism of a beauty contest.

The king concept will continue at
Pitt. Butch believes. “If you’ve
done it once. and it’s not a failure.
it’ll be around for years." he said.

A beauty contest flavor does not
pervade the king elections, Butch
thinks, because “In a king
competition. people will vote for
the name they know.”

Kappa Alpha Theta sorority did
not sponsor a queen candidate this
year but threw their support for
king to the president of Sigma Chi.

 frin Cica. Cica. a senior
psychology major. was honored by
the sorority’s nomination. He
thinks the king will become another
established tradition at Pitt.

“This year was the trial. to see
how many people would be
interested and how many would
vote. I think it’ll takehold,” he
said.

Cica thinks- the University will
benefit more from a king than will
the king himself. “It shows Pitt is
willing to change with the times.”
he said. He doesn’t see it as a
beauty contest.

“It's more or less a reward to the
guys for what they’ve done for the
 .  grsity. That's the only thing

  

people could judge on.” Cica said.

Black Action Society’s Bruce
Hawthorne, a sophomore business
student agreed the Homecoming
king will beneﬁt the University.

“It's still in its experimental
stage." he said. “but I believe it'll
catch on. lt’s another way of
getting students involved--and
that will help Pitt."

Hawthorne’s concept of the king
is “the typical Pitt student,” a
representative of the University.
The beauty contest flavor does not
exist. according to Hawthorne.
"That’s kind of laid aside. The
interviews with alumni are what
countf’

What does Hawthorne think he’ll
get out of it? “The pleasure of
doing it——-of being involved.”
Actually. Hawthorne is no new-
comer to beauty contests———last year
he was voted “Mr. Lotlirop" and
won the Resident Student Associa-
tion's “Mr. Legs" competition.

Co-sponsored by the Homecom-
ing Committee and the Commuter
Association. Frank Kunkel. ajunior
chemistry major. feels the king can
be an asset to the University by
carrying on , Homecoming tradi-
tions.

“This is not something with
purely ceremonial value.” Kunkel
explained. “lt’s involved with
tradition that's always there to fall
back on."

Kunkel had no hassles or
problems in running, aside from
occasional jokes from friends. He
also envisions the king becoming a
part of Pitt tradition. but doesn’t
think the competition has the
beauty contest ﬂavor so character-
istic of queen contests.

“Most people will be surprised
there’s even a king candidate."
Kunkel said. “lt’ll be a novelty.”

A senior psychology major.
Michael Sambuco, captain of the
Pitt Cheerleading Team and a
member of Delta Phi fraternity.
was sponsored by IFC and the Pitt
Cheerleaders. His reason for
running: "I like to get involved
in the University. This was
something different I thought I’d
enjoy.” I

Sambuco thinks the Homecom-
ing king will serve the University in
a public relations capacity and
believes it is destined to become a
Pitt tradition. “I think the fact that
seven guys showed interest in

running the first year is an
indication.” he said.
Like Cica. Sambuco feels the

king is a way of honoring male
students for their achievements.

but admits a small amount of the
beauty contest flavor does exist.

“When you run for anything,”
he said. people look at the
attractiveness of the candidates. ‘I
think more emphasis is placed (in
ability, but looks are still a factor.”

Mark Stablein. a sophomore
mining engineering student. spon-
sored by Phi Eta Sigma honorary
society. ran because he considered
it a challenge. “I really wanted to
get involved in campus life at Pitt.”
he said.

Stablein thinks the king may
serve to relay student views to
Administration. faculty and alum-
ni. Stablein thinks the _idea for
Homecoming king sprang from the
equal rights movement and sees it
as continuing for a long time.

“It solves a lot of problems—the
queen doesn't have to ﬁgure out
who her escort will be,” Stablein
chided. He also admits there is
some beauty contest ﬂavor.

“That’s the way people judge
others. by looks. It’s unfair but it
happens. Ithink it’s less than half
of the contest. but it does exist."

(Continued on Page 8)

-       
It takes a hotdog to run for Pitt’s first Homecoming King and engineering's
candidate Frank Wiener certainly has the name for it. Queen Donna Farey,

luckily, is exempt from puns, but the Homecoming Commlttee’s candidate
could easily be dubbed “Farrah Farey.”

BBB Reacts To Ripoffs

By DEBBI BARRAN
With the current rash of ripoffs, '

cons and other crimes headlining
each week’s Crime Report, it’s good
to know the unsuspecting victim has
somewhere to turn. The Pittsburgh
Better Business Bureau’s (BBB)
volunteer telephone consultants are

telephone complaints, all griev-
ances must be in writing. When
completed, the Customer Exper-
ience Record should be returned to
the BBB ofﬁce. The office then
forwards it to the ﬁrm or individual
in question. In-state firms are
allowed four weeks to respond to the

students; Davis also offered these
suggestions:

1. Think twice about purchasing
anything unseen. The reason the
salesman can’t bring the merchan-
dise to show you might be that it
doesn’t exist.

2. If that brand new calculator is

ready and listening.

The agency is one of 150
members of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus, which has
members in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Canada. Main-
tained by government funds, the
Pittsburgh ofﬁce has a full-time
staff, but most contact with the
public is made by the more than 50
volunteers who man the BBB’s
telephones daily.

After a victim explains his
problem, these volunteers initiate
the complaint process by mailing
him a Customer Experience Record.
No record is made of incoming

 

form; out-of-state firms are allowed
six weeks.

While the BBB can’t promise
miraculous results, a minority of
complaints are settled a few weeks
after they are brought to the
attention of the offending ﬁrm.
When neither party can come to a
satisfactory agreement, the BBB
offers the alternatives of mediation
and arbitration.

“Investigate before you invest
in anything,” said Kas Davis, a
staff supervisor for the Pittsburgh
BBB. This applies to any purchase,
especially tempting offers similar to
the recent stereo sting involving Pitt

too good to pass up, pay by check or
money order, so there is a way to
trace the individual salesman or
ﬁrm if it conks out during your
statistics exam.

3. Likewise, if your stereo
requires service, it’s easier to
return it to a major retailer or dealer
than to try to track down the private
salesman. Ask the person who’s
willing to give you such a good deal"
if he's as courteous in offering
repairs.

4. Don't be pressured or
intimidated by other students or
outsiders promoting items such as

Tonight is opening night for
Pitt’s Studio Theater. located in the
basement of the Cathedral of
Learning. Though showtime is
approaching, there is no man on a
ladder sticking new letters -on the
marquee, no orchestratuning up
for rehearsal in the pit nor any
hired workmen splashing varnish
on a high-curtained stage.

The routine is quite different at
the StudioTheater.

L
Lab. Theater

Instead, the “Black Box” theater
—nothing more than a medium-
sized black room with klieg lights
and slatted wooden walls—was a
disaster area.

On Monday, yards of plastic
were rolled out across the floor,
and various props—a narrow bed, a
coat rack, an old desk—were
pushed to one side.

A man in overalls was carrying
freshly-painted walls. _as thin as
cardboard, from one end of the
theater to the other, and someone

‘Ruling Class’ Offers Change

By LISA RUBENSTEIN

Pitt News Staff Writer

Bill, Royston, the director of the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater, and
Bingo O’Malley, an actor, were at a
party about six months ago. It was
the kind of party at which people
talk and drink.

O’Malley turned to Royston and
said, “Do you know what play I've
always wanted to do?”

“No, what?” asked Royston.

“l’ve always wanted to do ‘The
Ruling Class.’ ”

“Well,” Royston said, “You
might be a little _drunk, so if you
still want to do it, call me in the
morning."

O’Malley called Royston the next
morning, and so, about six months

later, the Lab Theater is on the

verge of opening “The Ruling
Class,” by Peter Barnes. .

“The Ruling Class,” which
opens on Friday, is one of the most
ambitious plays the Lab Theater
has ever done, and it is, .Royston
said recently. substantially differ-
ent than the type of shows usually
done there. Twenty actors and a
number of special effects are

involved in the show.
The Lab Theater is . usually

known for alternative pieces such
as ensemble works, with only a few
characters, and generally more
thought provoking and experiential
shows that can be found in
“regular” theater.

“The Ruling Class” is a play that
pokes fun at the English artiste-
cracy. Themain character is a

Pitt News Staff Writer

Blank Generation
Richard Hell And The Voidoids
Sire

Richard Hell’s music is an
uncanny balance struck between
order and anarchy. It’s what rock
’n’ roll might sound like if it could
get drunk.

Marc Bell on drums and Hell on
‘bass maintain a tight rhythm
section and promote the cause of
order. while in anarchy’s corner is
Bob Quine on lead guitar, Ivan
Julian on rhythm guitar and Hell on
vocals.

Quine and Julian are sometimes
ambassadors to the side of order,
though their play never looses its

penchant for chaos.

When Hell’s old band, Televi-
sion, is compared with the Voidoids
itis instantly apparent Hell did well

  ‘

work of both bands might be called
abstract (in comparison with
popular rock bands, anyway) the
Voidoids are much closer to the
mainstream.

Where Television was .calcula-
ted, restrained and heavy on
structure. Hell and his band are
loose, uneven and spontaneous.

Hell writes innovative rock ’n’
roll: an unlikely and intriguing
combination of rhythm and melody.
Hell’s bass and the two guitars
seem to pursue subjective and
unreconcilable lines of play, yet an
.intergration exists. one that has
never been recorded before and
one that never fails to keep the
listener listening.

As melody and rhythm propel
each other forward, Hell’s high,
boyish vocal whines and fluctuates
like a demented air-raid siren. He

British nobleman who thinks he is
God.‘ As the play progresses, he
changes from an eccentric who
thinks he is a_ loving God. into an
eccentric who realizes, through the
actions of the other characters, he
is a God of wrath and fear.

The play, written in 1968,
received much critical acclaim, but
little public attention. Several
years later, it was turned into a
movie starring Peter O’Toole,
evolved into a cult film.

It is not the type of play usually
produced at the Lab Theater. It is a
funny play, and the Lab Theater is
using everything from slapstick to
song and dance as mechanisms for
the play’s attack on sanity. The
Lab Theater does not normally
attempt a play that has been turned
into a movie, but Royston feels this
play fits in well with the theater’s'
conception of alternative theater.

“We are trying to create a type
of theater that is an alternative t0
deadly theater—the realistic, na-
turalistic theater—that is found at
places like the Public Theater-

Chidgey shook her head. “It
hardly looks like it will be ready to
open." she said. “It will b€~
though.”

The show is Eugene lonesco’s
“Rhinoceros.” the Studio Thea-
ter’s opening production.

“It’s a good play.” director Gary
Elm said. “It gives everybody a
chance to do something.”

Giving “everybody a chance to
do something” has been the goal of
the Studio Theater for almost a
decade. The “Black Box." 8
concept that dates from the

beginning of the century but only
recently has come into its own. 1'5 8
symbol of this innovative philo-

sophy.
“It’s a wonderful place to
design," Glickman explained.

“You have such a variety of
possibilities. You can put the
audience and the play Wh€I'€V€1‘
you like."

Unlike the University of Pitts-
burgh Theater, the Studio Theater
produces only student-run shows.

‘

It serves as a workshop for
performers. directors. technical
theater arts majors and anyone
interested in drama wishing to try
out his talents before a limited
audience. The Theater holds only
100 people.

The Student Government Board
ﬁnances the theater. and this
year’s budget allows seven pro-
ductions. The plays are selected
from proposals submitted by
people wishing to‘ participate.
especially directors.

The degree of innovation the
theater pursues is determined by
its members rather than by any
established policy. Offerings have
ranged from musical comedy to
existential drama to farce. but the
club's future direction depends
simply on what the next group of

proposals offers.
“Rhinoceros” is a modern sort of

play, Glickman said, “so it will
probably attract a good number of
college students. and maybe
parents of the people in it.”

Theater production “The Ruling Class,’’ opening this Friday night.

“In the last 25 years, the
electronic medium can do what
deadly theater does in a much
better way. People can pay less
and see the same type of thing on
T.V. or in ﬁlm.”

What makes the Lab different
from deadly theater is that it makes
the most out of having a live
audience and live actors, Royston
said. “Here, the audience
experiences a piece by being
involved. while at a film, the
audience may observe and enjoy,
but not experience.”

So. when you go to a play at the

Lab Theater, you don’t see it 

much as you experience it.
Further. not many of the shows
there could be classified as
lighthearted and funny. “The
Ruling Class" has the potential to
be both funny and xthought
provoking.

With “The Ruling Class,” the
company and the audience will
have the chance to find out if a
show that is not normally revived
within the realm of alternative
theater. can be a success.

‘Matt Cavanaugh is back, alive
and well.
Willie Taylor’s- back, too. He’s
also alive and well.

Cavanaugh had to leave the '
Panthers’ offensive lineup with a
cracked left wrist. Taylor, on the
other hand, never left, although he
must have felt as though he was on a
sabbatical, considering how often

_ Cavanaugh’s replacements, fresh-

men Rick Trocano and Lindsey
Delaney, threw the football to him.

For four weeks, or as long as
Cavanaugh was out, Taylor caught
only four passes, good for 47 yards
and one touchdown. Sickly statistics
for one of the deadliest receivers
around. '

Understandably, Taylor was
happy to have Cavanaugh return to
the Panthers’ starting lineup
Saturday night against Florida—as
his statistics prove. The senior
ﬂanker had a ﬁeld day, catching two
passes for 67 yards and one
touchdown. Ironically, Jo Jo Heath,
throwing off the halfback option,
lofted the scoring toss to Taylor.

But, looking back on the game
and the way it ended—a 17-17
deadlock——Taylor wasn’t as happy
as might be expected.

‘ ‘Sure, Iwas happy to be catching
the ball more,” Taylor said earlier
this week. “But I wanted to win. We
didn’t lose. But we didn’t win,
either. -

“Personally, Ithink I didn’t block
that well,” he continued. “There’s
more to being a wide receiver than

H just catching the football. You have

to block, too. There were a couple of
times where I think either Freddie
(tailback Jacobs) or Elliott (fullback

Bucs, Phils, Royals: A Trinle Plight

   
 

Walker) could have broken a couple
more long runs if I had blocked
properly.

“Maybe the heat bothered us.
We weren’t used to it at all. I just
didn’t like the way the game ended.
We should have won.”

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill

WILLIE TAYLOR

2 receptions for 67 yards

 

Taylor A live & Well

didn’t like the ﬁnal score either, but
said he wasn’t disappointed with
the way Taylor played. Maybe, the
ﬁrst-year coach implied before a
recent practice session at Pitt
Stadium, Taylor was a little too
self-critical.

“I'm sure he is disappointed,”
Sherrill said outside the Pitt
Stadium locker room. “But I’m sure
our whole team is disappointed with
the way things turned out Saturday
night. We didn’t want a tie—we
wanted to win.

“As far as Willie goes,” Sherrill
added, “maybe there are some
coverages where he’s going to have
to improve his blocking. But
knowing Willie and what a ﬁne,
determined football player he is,
he’s going to improve and improve
soon.”

Sherri] hopes that improvement
occurs Saturday, afternoon, when
Pitt hosts Navy at Pitt Stadium. In
the meantime, everyone can be
happy that both Cavanaugh and
Taylor are back—alive and well—in
the Pitt offensive lineup.

Slippery Rock Sticks Pitt
Field Hockey Squad, 3-0

The women’s ﬁeld hockey team
couldn’t overcome the cold, rainy
weather Saturday as they fell to
_Slippery Rock, 3-O. Both teams had
numerous chances to score, but
neither "squad could beat the
opposing goalie until the Rockets
broke the ice with 10 minutes left in
the contest. '

The only thing Pantherette coach
Janet McDowell could be pleased
about was that Pitt improved on

last year’s Slippery Rock game,

which the Rockets won, 6-1

In the backup game, the Pitt
jayvees lost to the Slippery Rock
jayvees, 2-0. Both the varsity

squad and the jayvees travel to

Stottlemyer and Junk Food:
Danger for Opposing Matmen

Pizza, ice cream and just about all high calorie junk food have
collectively become a wrestler’s Public Enemy Number One. This
Winter. Rande Stottlemyer may wrestle in weight divisions differing by
16 pounds. so the Panther redhead is painfully familiar with the
problems of “cutting weight.”

For the most part. the athletes must shed the extra poundage without
the guidance of any special diet, although Stottlemyer joked, “Coach
(Dave) Adams always invites us over to his house to make sure we won’t
raid the refrigerator before a meet. Skip Bolin went to his house a lot last

year. ’ ’

 

Weight, however, was to be a mere annoyance for Stottlemyer as
compared to a knee injury combined with previously-bruised ribs that
added up to a 1976 redshirt.

Stottlemyer said that perhaps the injury was “the best thing that
could have happened.”

‘ ‘I got the "chance to sit back and realize how much I really missed the
sport. Now, I can’t wait for the season to begin.”

After a successful high school career in which Stottlemyer lost four
matches, he achieved all-American status as _a Pitt freshman by placing
sixth in the 126-pound‘ division of the national collegiate tournament.

A high school defeat was indirectly responsible for Stottlemyer’s
collegiate success. During his senior year at Hickory High School, he lost
a close 8-7 decision in the ﬁnal moments of the Pennsylvania state

Good grief. Here we ‘are, just starting that
most hallowed of autumnal rites—the World

/“rte ;.~oeries———and I find myself looking back on the ’77

baseball season as a three-time‘ loser. My
casualty list: the Pirates, the Phillies and the
Kansas City Royals.

The first and deepest of my losses was the
failure of my long-time heroes, the Pirates, t0
dislodge the Phillies from the top spot in the
National League East. Their Neanderthal
philosophy of bludgeoning the opponent was
aided by some new-found larceny on the
basepaths, but still the pitching staff could not
consistently perform well enough to match the

_ talented men from Philadelphia.

When it became all too apparent in mid-
September that the Phillies were not to be
caught, I resigned myself to cheering for the
Eastern Division champion in the playoffs.
Which brings us to defeat number two.

Although such an activity ran directly afoul of
my deepest instincts, I was forced to root for the
Phils in their series against Los Angeles. I guess
it’s some type of nationalism, but I felt a team
capable of fighting off the Pirates was certainly
capable of dispatching the Dodgers. Also, when
viewed objectively, the Phils seemed to have the
better overall team.

After the Phils’ 7-5 comeback win in game
one, I was almost gloating. Then came game
two, a 1oss,,,and game three, another loss...and
game four. the third and fatal loss.

My poor heart now nearly broken, I had but
one ray of hope: that the Yankees, those dyspep-
tic mercenaries who should wear Pampers in-
stead of pinstripes, would get humiliated _by the
upstart Royals, who sported baseball’s best
regular-season record.

Alas, it was not to be. The Yanks rolled ’em in
five games.

 

So it is that 1977 World Series time finds the 2
broken man; my spirit beaten, my hopes dashed
I have been disapoointed bv the BUGS, fFUStT3t€d
and enraged by our beloved triends from
Philadelphia, and disillusioned by the Yankees.

My last chance for some small moral victory
rests with the Dodgers. But if they should fall, if
fate can be so cruel and heartless and blind, if the
detestable Yankees become major league
baseball’s class team, then it’s time to start
rooting for the Seattle Mariners...

Cavanaugh has class

In the Pitt locker room after the Florida game i
Saturday night. Matt Cavanaugh showed 35
much class in handling questions as he has con— i
sistently shown on the field throughout his (
career. (

The possibility for second guessing was enor-
mous, and at the focus of" the questions was
Cavanaugh, who quarterbacked the entire game ‘
with a protective foam pad on his left wrist. Did
you come back too soon? Was the cast inter-
fering with your ball-handling? ‘Was it the main
factor behind all the fumbles? ‘Were you tool
rusty after only a week and a half of practice? 1
Cavanaugh could easily have hidden behind the(
ready-made excuse wrapped around his wrist.
But he refused to alibi. “I’ll take the blame,” he
said, denying that the cast had anything to do‘
With ll _ {

To all the second-guessers, it’s true that
perhaps freshman Rick Trocano should have
started. But it would have been terribly unfair
had -Cavanaugh not started, for if anyone hast
busted his ...r, wrist for the Panther team, it is(
Matt Cavanaugh. Maybe he was rusty and
maybe it was mainly his fault that Pitt fumbled
11 times. But all that is trivial, for one factor ‘
was far more important in the eyes of Jackie ‘
Sherrill: Cavanaugh said he could-play—“If I
didn’t think I could help the team win, I
wouldn’t have come back”—and he therefore
deserved to play. Matt Cavanaugh has given too
much of himself to the Panther program to have (
been denied that opportunity.

    Rain Mars Invitational  

By ANGELA VAVITHES
At a very wet invitational meet
Saturday at Kettering in Dayton,
Ohio, the Pantherette cross country
team ﬁnished ﬁfth. The meet drew
teams from many Eastern states

and participants of all ages, despite

the rainy, cold weather. Becky
Falck, who ﬁnished 27th, lead the
tightly grouped Pitt squad. The
other Pantherette competitors
were: Therese Walton, who
ﬁnished 32nd; Brenda Chorpen-
ning, 34th; Diana Miller, 37th;
Kathy Paczkowski, 40th; and Marie
Scuillo, 49th.

The Pantherettes arrived in
Dayton at 11 a.m. to walk the

three-mile course in a rain storm.
The course, run twice by the
competitors was fairly ﬂat, partially
consisting of a one-mile) loop with
two small hills. According to
Chorpenning, “The course was
pretty fast and the hills were not
difﬁcult.”

This was one of the season’s
most important meets for the team.
Powerful teams from Eastern
colleges like the University of
Tennessee, which captured first
place, attended, along with numer-
ous AAU teams from cities like
Washington, D.C. and Kettering
competed.

various age groups, with the Pitt
women competing in the 14-30-year
-old category. There was also a
group of 30—and-over women who
ran a one-mile course.

The meet between Pitt and
Allegheny Community College,
originally scheduled for 9 p.m.

'today has been postponed until

Tuesday, Nov. 1. The meet will be
held in Schenley Park.

The next competition for Pitt will
be on Saturday, Oct. 15, when the
team will travel to Maryland.

After bruised ribs and a knee injury resulted in a red shirt last year, Senior
grappler Rande Stottlemyer (on top) will return to this year’s Panther squad in
hopes of bolstering Pitt’s chances of upsets in the Eastern Wrestling League.

   

Pitt Grappler Fights 

Way Back to Action

‘ ‘I love to hunt,” he said.i“I go up to the mountains with my friends or
my dad (and sometimes Mutts, my beagle) and we have the best time
hunting small game or deer. And although I’ve only archery-hunted
once, I’ve really grown fond of it, too.”

‘ ‘I’ve always been taught ‘safety ﬁrst’ in the woods and that you have
to be humane to animals. I know it sounds funny, but when I shoot at an
animal, I hope to either kill it or miss by about 10 feet.”

The Stottlemyers are of Gerrnan-English descent and Rande, who
claims that “Mom’s all right even if she did give me red hair” likes to
spend time with his father working on cars.

“I’m Just beginning to understand engines, as you can tell if you've

ever seen my ’64 Volkswagen,” he

miles on it, and I’ve pushed it more
miles than I’d like to admit.” .

Fortunately, Stottlemyer is in
much better shape than his VW,
and in wrestling, you have to be in
good condition.

“The sport takes everything out
of you and requires so much
stamina and coordination that
sometimes in a match you just can’t
move anymore, you’re so tired, " he
said. “We say that ‘the fox has

 

in a corner of the mat and sucks up
all the good oxygen.
“Unfortunately, that fox has got

me quite a few times,” he laughed.
