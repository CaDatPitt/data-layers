Changes For 1961

The Student Union has
nounced that new appointments to
the 1960-61 Student Union Board

J have been made.

They are as follows: student di-
rector, Richard Moriarity; Ann
Abbinanti, assistant student direc-
’tor; Sheila Rinner, office admin-

istrator; John French, program di-
rector; Joseph Deringer, building
director; Sue Kufta, public rela-

In this,

. changes have been made in the

new board. The ﬁrst of the
changes is that the,board will
consist of the above students and
also staff members who are con-
nected with the Student Union.

The second change is that there
are now fewer students on the
board since there were too many
conflicting areas represented on
the board, and therefore many of
the functions were .duplicated.

STAFF POSITIONS

The Pitt News now is accept-
ing applications for staff posi-

by Kentucky’s Gov. Bert Combs,
citing March 18 “Stephen Foster

The reason for the proclama-

The proclamation is Kentucky’s

Isler Vetoes Motion

For )Deferred Rush

" Compound Proposal Ruled Unconstitutional

xOn Two Counts‘ by Parliamentarian Lewis

By ‘HARRIET WEHNER .
A motion ordering Interfraternity Council to prepare a
report on defered rushing has beenvetoed because it‘is un-

constitutional on two counts. -

Chuck Isler: president of the student body, explained:
‘I vetoed this motion when I received a message from
the Senate parliamentarian, Morrison Lewis, who had dili-

gently searched the feasibility of?
this motion, and had labeled it’

out of order because of its com-
pound nature.”

Lewis explained that a com-
pound motion contains_two decis-
ions which are completely un-
related. The ﬁrst part of the mo-

tion stated that it be recognized,-

that it is within the power of the

Senate, to maintain its jurisdiction

over_ all university—wide student
activities. ‘ _

He added, “In this part’ of the ‘
motion, the Senate tried to set-
tle -the matter of jurisdiction for
which they" do" not have the
power. ‘This power of determin-

V ing jurisliction _ rests with. the
Student Affairs’ committee.

The second part of the motion
which was completely unrelated
read as follows: That I.F. under-
take a study on the possibility of
a deferred rushing of ﬁrst tri-
mester students; and then submit
the results to the Senate at which
time the Senate will act on the
matter as they deem wise.

This, also, was unconstitutional
becauseit does not come under
their jurisdiction. Dr. Swartz-
baugh, dean of students, explain:
ed how the Senate had confused
their power.

He said, “Ordering IF to pre-
pare a report or to have de-
ferred rushing is similar to_ tell-
ing the honoraries that they
must lower their quality point
average.”

Swartzbaugh gave several other
examples which brought to light
the confusion of the Senate’s idea
concerning their power.

He. concluded by saying that
neither the Senate nor the. SA
committee has the power to en-
force such a policy—-“we may
only suggest that they do some-
thing.” IF itself, or the university,

are the only ones capable of en-

- forcing such a policy.

reedom and

u r g h Press

 

Schweit- 
er. .
Schweitzer seems to have
claimedthat there was no “broad
humanity” today, and the Press
editorial writer attempted to re-

“fute this statement in his article.

» *\~*..‘‘‘

It is interesting to examine the
pastor’s comments
Schweitzer and the state of the
world in general, by which one

concerning .

is enabled to see the myths’ that .

still envelop American ways of
thought. »

First, says the ‘pastor, “There
is more genuine brotherhood and
love being expressed and dem-
onstrated in .-the world today

3 than in any previous time in his-

tory.” The charities are thriving,
and “the quality‘ of mercy is
very much alive.”, ,
The reason‘ that’ Schewitzer,
however, is a- bit cynical and
despairful concerning hum an

brotherhood _and love is that he
forsook

“the ministry ‘of »t he
word, of God”, to become a
medical missionary. In- doing so,
he expresses little faith in the
reality of an eternal God.

Born Out of Time or. In?

This can be attributed partly,
according 'to‘the pastor, to the

fact that" Schweitzer grew up"at

a time when Biblical scholars
were‘ “skeptical about the divin-
ity of Christ.” This ‘skepticism
led to the enthronement of ma-
terialism on the throne of Eu-
rope, and to the advancement of
secularism in America.

Secularism, which according to
the pastor‘ denies the existence
‘of _God, the Eternal Judgment
and Life- ix yond the grave,_ -is_the
subtle subversive force that is
undermining our
American way of life.

While examining the pastor’s

society _ and p

claims the important point to /

consider is not whether‘Schweit-
zer should have forsaken the
ministry and gone to Africa. The
important point to consider is the
underlying implication of the

_ ‘pastor’s letter which reflects an

American way of thinking that
has been accepted for far too
long. Before -this basic fallacy is
examined, some of the pastor’s
incidental remarks might be
considered.

As to the existence of a pre-

1 ponderance of brotherly love in

the world today, empirical evid-

. ence seems to be lacking. Swas-
'tikas, lynching, parties and the

enslavemcnt of millions of men’s

minds under totalitarian regimes. -

make it hard to believe that, the

.20th century is leading the world

"3 quotas doesn’t spare a Negro col- fense.

weekly throughout the school year except

to. any utopian ideal. The. fact
that charities are reaching their

lege student the intense pain and
loneliness which he must endure
in certain Southern states.

When Really Seen

So the fact that Schweitzer
may be a bit synical as to the
existence of any broad human-

‘ity in the world today may not
be a logical consequence of his
forsakingtthe ministry. It just
may be that he opened his eyes
and looked at a world where
suffering is as real as it is use-
less.

But the most dangerous part
‘of the pastor’s analysis ‘is that it
supports the idea flourishing in
America that there’s something
a little un-American about non-
believers. The pastor admits that
Schweitzer is a great human-
itarian and that he has alleviated

human suffering, but he doesn’t-

like the idea that Schweitzer
expresses “no faith in an eternal
God.” .

For this. lack of faith in God
is a subtle force undermining
the American way of life. What
the pastor forgets to tell us is
"that religion devoid of morality
is twice as injurious as -moral
atheism, which, contrary to the
beliefs of-. many Americans, is
not a contradiction in terms.
Atheists can be compassionate
human beings who are ultimate-
'ly concerned about the future
and destiny of man.

Bertrand Russell, an avowed
atheist, "is one of the foremost
leaders of the movement to stop
nuclear testing. Thus, it is not
particularly secularism which is
a subversive force in America,
« for neither atheists nor believers
can be _wholly accused of under-
mining society until appropriate
statistics are presented. .
Perhaps Another Reason

, The pastor has not done so,
and if he had,ion_e suspects that
his results would notconfirm his
assumptions. Until then,
Schweitzer has chosen his way
of life. The validity of this
choice can be repudiated, but not
on the grounds. that Schweitzer
has never ‘expressed belief’ in an
eternal God. ~

, If Schweitzer is pessimistic
about the future of humanity, his

policy of “reverence for life”-

and his practical fulfillment _ of
this philosophy make one realize
‘ that humanity still possesses
within its midst very great men.
At the sametime, one can con-
sider the southern leaders_ of the
Ku Klux Klan diligently attend-

ing church ,every Sunday and \

subsequently donning their robes
and terrorizing Negroes.
. Perhaps what. is really neces-
sary is thatsour American way
of life should ‘be undermined a
little,’ because part of it deserves
to be. At least that part_ of the
American myth which says that
“All atheists are inherently evil”

and that “All people who criti—' .

cize capitalism are rabid com-
munists,” should be modiﬁed.
Unless our schools and univer-
sities inculcate tolerance for
those ‘people in a society who
criticize some _of the established
norms, ‘there will be no people
sufficiently discriminating to de-
fend those parts of the American
way of life which still remain
worthwhile and worthy of de-

Many‘ Problems Hinge . . .

Someone Better Tell

By Murray Chess ., ‘

A “brash.‘ young man” arrived at the University
of -Pittsburgh four years ago to head the gigantic
renovation of a “streetcar school.”

Since then, the story of Chancellor Edward
Harold Litehﬂeld has" been the
story of the university, or vice-
versa, depending on where one A
wishes to place the emphasis. '. ,

To say there has been change 

would be a gross understatement.
Change, in fact, has been the
major theme here during those
four years and will continue to
be the theme for many more
years. _ 

In his Fall Convocation ad-

dress, “Reﬂections on a Changing Image,” Chan- '

cellor Litehﬂeld emphasized the university is
striving toibecome “second to none” in". the nation.
He mentioned such gains as would be necessary
would take us a generation to realize.” ‘

As everyone, including the "chancellor, is aware,
many difficulties must be overcome before the uni-
versityreaches that sacred status. "We would like,
at’ this point, to set forth an observation which, to
many critics ‘of the university, may not seem
original. However, in discussing this observation,
we hope we can be more rational than most of
the critics. ’ V
Some Poor Sighting ’ .

While making plans for the future and putting

other plans into operation at the present time on ‘

the upper level,of the university -- the adminis-

trative level — Chancellor Litehﬂeld and ‘his asso- A

ciates are losing’ sight of currentproblems on the
lower levels -— the students and the faculty.
These areas are not ,being neglected. to the
extent that nothing is "being done for them, but
they are being disregarded just enoughthat glaring
weaknesses can be seen. ” . .
Take, as an example of negligence in the stu-
dent’ affairs area, the case of the non-existent
‘dean of men. The last DOM, Dr. Theodore Biddle,
left in June, 1958. The only explanationoﬁered
for not appointing a new dean is an- unoﬁicial one:

the university is not willing to pay the salary it

would take to hire a new clean.

As a result, Dr. William Swartzbaugh, dean of
students, has been burdened with the usual duties
of a dean of men besides carrying out the seem-
ingly endless duties of his immediate position. Vice

‘chancellors and assistant chancellors there can be
-- more perhaps than most big corporations have ‘

vice presidents -—- but there is no need for a dean
of men.» '

Moving to an example of the negligence in the
treatment of faculty, we ﬁnd some strange criteria
have been established which must be‘ met by a

Student Rest‘ Area
Editor, Pitt News:

It is unfortunate that the dig-
nity that surrounds the deans‘
and assistant chancellors’ offices
is lost around the many offices
on the eighth floor of the Cathe-
dral of Learningbecause of the.
many students and university

employees who stretch out on
the couches to sleep.

The downey couches outside
the eighth floor officesare for
studying and ‘not for sleep. These
students and employees are not
at fault for turning this area into

a “flop house,” but the univer» ‘

sity is not for providing a place
for students to rest during the
day without returning home.

,Three.Term Calendar

    Has Unique Approach

Students to Graduate in Shorter Time;
" Professional Training Possible Sooner

In less than two weeks the University of Pittsburgh will
launch the third and pioneer term of its new Trimester Cal-
endar Plan instituted last September. _

It is a plan unique in its approach to the traditional
schoel‘ calendar and far-thinking in its concept of ‘a student’s

formal education. §

The Trimester Calendar Plan

' offers students the opportunity to

complete their college education

in shorter time at the same cost;

to obtain graduate or professional

training sooner; to begin their
careers at an earlier age.

It also offers Pitt students an
opportunity to participate in a
new academic program which is
attracting national attention.

Take Four Years” which appeared
in the March 26 Saturday Eening

time _spent in preparation for ca-
reers is cited as the .most insistent
problem in higher education to-
day.

This article says in part:’

“It is a wry commentary on our
colleges, presumably the incuba-
tors of progressive ideas, that they
are operating on a schedule geared
to the seventeenth century. Four
years still is the prescribed period
for earning a bachelor’s degree in
the arts or sciences despite deci-
sive evidence that such a leisurly
pace falls far short of utilizing
efficiently the student's capabili-
ties and the school’s facilities.

trimester, according to Dr. George

College.

The courses to be offered during
the spring trimester, said Dr.
Hoffman, were chosen on the basis
of a survey conducted to deter-

,_mine in which courses students
would be most interested.

Dr. Hoffman said that in many
cases Johnstown students who
were enrolled fulltirne during the
first two trimesters are planning

Variety In
Courses  
Featured

S, An effort has been made to
schedule for the third trimes-

3r "courses which appeal to
a variety of students and
which can satisfy their needs.

Basic and required courses

are scheduled in all departments
in conformity with the original
plan that the first Spring Tri-
‘mester should offer work largely
for lower‘ division students, that
is, freshmen and sophomores.

English composition and intro-
duction to literature courses re-
quired for graduation will be
given, as will basic, language,
mathematics and science courses.
In most cases the ﬁrst, second and
third terms of a speciﬁc language
is scheduled to be taught.

.Some departments in liberal

arts are offering special work.
The political science depart-
ment, for example, will give a
non-credit tutorial program for
undergraduates‘ who wish to
participate. '

Attempts have been made, also,
to schedule a selection of inter-
esting courses other than basic or
required ones. The departm nt of
ﬁne arts will give, besides a sur-
vey course, a theory and practice
course and one in the study of
style.

Honors work and seminars will
-{be offered" by the departments of
English, speech, and ‘several en-
gineering departments. Many
areas will offer opportunity for

Registrations Exceed
est Early Estimates

2,650 Applications Processed;
Grad Picture Also Favorable

Registration for the third trimester is already well
above the best estimates made earlier this year, according
to Dr. John Geise, assistant chancellor of student affairs.

Although the tally has not yet been completed some
eregistrations had already been processed by the-

Approximately 2,050 students
were expected to enroll on the
basis of the indications given by
students in the fallpre-registra-
tion.and estimates of the Deans
and the Office of Institutional
Planning. '

Estimates Exceeded

In every undergraduate school,
the number of pre—regi.strations
counted to date exceeds the num-
ber estimated, said Geise.

The School of Liberal Arts,
with more thran 800 students
enrolled to date, is "well over its
estimate, as‘ is, the School of
Engineering‘ and Mines with
more than 650.

Graduate pre-registration
still being processed, but the pic-
ture there is also very good, ac-
cording to Geise.

Result’ Significant

“These results are significant,”
Geise further stated. “They in-
dicate that the trimester plan, as
proposed by Chancellor Litchfield,
and ‘developed by the faculty‘ and
administration, has been well ac-
cepted by the students as an op-
portunity to meet the students
needs. , =

“We should expect that as the
trimester "program moves into
its’ second year, that these op-
portunities will be increasingly
accepted by the students in
keeping with the national trend
toward year round education
that is new setting in.

“The students of the University
are in the unique position of par-
ticipating in a program which is
gaining national leadership,” Geise
concluded.

Programs Designed for _'Warm Weather

Many Activities Slated      

Activities and programs for stu-
dents at the university are sched-
uled to continue on a full scale
during the Spring Trimester this
year.

“We are making sure the third
term ‘is not something just" ap-
pended to the other two trimes-
ters,” said Dr. David Henderson,
director of_' Educational Planning,
commenting on activities and
courses for the new term.

Dr. Henderson also stressed that
the warm weather during the new
trimester would make possible
many varieties of activities not
previously scheduled during the
regular school year.

In an attempt to meet this goal,
ﬁve Midday Series are planned at
the Student Union, where a num-
ber of other events are also sched-
uled. These include seven films,
to be shown bi-weekly, 2 pop con-
certs, and ten Friday evening
dances sponsored by the Student
Union Board,

Midday Programs Planned

Some of the programs scheduled
for Midday Series presentations
are talks by Wolfgang Yourgrau
and Irving Howe, and a program
of Chamber Music by members of
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orches-
tra.' '

Hours at Library

To Remain Same

Library hours will not be af-
fected by the third trimester, ac-
cording to University Librarian
Lorena Garloch.“

The tentative library schedule
is as follows: Monday through
Thursday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday
and Saturday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and
Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. and from
6 to 10 p.m. “These hours will not
be changed unless students fail to
take advantage of our library fa-
cilities,” Miss Garloch said.

Adams said that a survey of

Students wishing to register for
evening classes have until April
18 to do so, Adams said. He added
that they may register at the eve-

courses for the third trimester that

to satisfy their demands has been
made. ’

“The phasing originally planned

ble,” commented David Hender-
son, director of Educational Plan-
ning.

Dr. Henderson refeirred to the
original plan to offer only lower
division courses in the Spring
term of this ﬁrst year under the
new system. Upper division
courses, that is, those offered‘,
mainly for juniors, seniors, and
graduate students would have
been introduced in following years
during the Spring term.

He estimated that a
‘number of graduate students
will be taking work,” and
stressed that it was important to
“satisfy student needs when
they arise,” and‘ to think in
terms of a full year and not two
terms with an appended third."

Many senior faculty members
will be seen on campus during the
third trimester, and all depart-
ment heads report that their areas
will be staffed by teachers from
the middle and upper ranks.

With the movement into a tri-
mester calendar, programming
will be geared to meet the needs
‘of both students and teachers.
The programming will bring about
one term unit courses,
breaking away from the two
sequence course. This, according
to Dean of Liberal Arts, Albert
B. Martin, “Will make courses
more educationally effective.”

Among the one course selection
being offered during the third
term are: Victorian writers with

‘professor Edwin L. Peterson; the

American drama with associate
professor Abe Laufe; philosophy
of literature with assistant profes-
sor Edgar F. Wells; acting with
‘associate professor John H. Ul-
rich. i

Race culture world with as-
sistant professor Arthur Tuden;
current problems in economies
with assistant professor Vojtech
E. Andie; geography of middle
America with assistant professor
Leonard Kuntz; problems of the.
16th century with associate.pro-
fessor Charles I-I. George and
family relations with associate
-professor Howard Roland.

In the Schools of Liberal Arts
and Education the number of re-
turning teachers will be one-third
of the present faculty. Engineering
and Mines is the exception and
will have almost 50% "of their
present faculty.

This semester there are 466
teachers in the divisions pres-I
ently under the trimester plan.

- Next semester there will be
about 150. Engineering and
Mines have 109 teachers this
semester but will function with
52'during the next term.

The School of. Nursing will
have its entire student body on

the trimester plan. The Schools
of Dentistry and Medicine will
remain on the semester plan. The
School of Pharmacy will be on
both the trimester and semester
plan.

Last January the University an-
nounced’ a large-scale student aid

designed to meet “the total dem-
onstrated need” of any University
student in good '_ standing.

Theprogram is directly related
to the University’s belief in the
value to students of attendance in
three terms per year. The increase

Chancellor Litchﬁeld in his‘

inaugural- address. May 1957
said, “I propose that we commit
ourselves to the proposition that
every student be given both a,
liberal education and a profes-
sional training.

“This follows from the twofold
conviction that too many profes-
sional people are personally and
intellectually narrow, and on the
other hand that too many emerg-
ing from the university today are
without the professional compet-
ence necessary to make a maxi-
mum contribution to our society."

Depth Retained

Any, new plan, he said, would
have toseek to combine the two
without sacriﬁcing the depth of
either. The plan that Chancellor
Litchﬁeld proposed three years
ago and which is currently in op-
eration scrapped the‘two semester
academic calendar and put in its
place an eleven-month schedule
with three trimesters. ,

Fred Heckinger, educator ed-
itor for the NEW YORK TIMES,
writing about Pitt’s Trimester
Plan for the SATURDAY RE-
VIEW (Sept. 12, 1959) com-
mented at length on the desir-
ability and necessity for com-
biningboth a liberal education
and professional training.

“The point is,” he wrote, “that
the needs of modern society can-
not continue to rely on the leis-
urely gait of an era which much
as we may regard it, is dead.”

a generation or two ago; today it
is an outworn cliche on which

some liberal-arts colleges would
like to get by.

“The newineed is for one or
the other—the broadly educated,
cultured intellectual and the
s-harp, skilled technician. The
need is for a fusion of the two.
The University of Pittsburgh
sees its bold tampering with the
calendar in exactly this light.

“ ‘America’s’ young people need

fessional training (as preparation

But it feels that lip service to a
need for change is not enough.
The Pittsburgh proposal (to divide
the academic year into three tri-
mesters) is as simple as it is
revolutionary.”_ '

Other Schools Consider

Mr. Heckinger points out that
as a direct result of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh plan, other ma-
jor universities are studying the
trimester calendar plan.

”It appears certain that
changes are about to be made
and Pittsburgh has started the
ball rolling,” he says. “Conser-

V vatives will frown, and some
may sneer. Enthusiasts will see
utopia in the making. But no-
body interested in higher edu-
cation will ignore the experi-
ment—-one of the ﬁrst designed
to deal, dramatically with the

Many Participate

It is encouraging that such a
substantial’ number of students are‘
interested in participating in the
Trimester Calendar Plan in its
ﬁrst year of operation.

In the undergraduate schools,
a full course of study will be
available; in many schools and
divisions a selected number of
graduate courses will be oﬁered;
a varied program of, extra-cur-
ricular activities has been plan-
ned. ‘
iThe University believes that an
increase in the effectiveness of its
entire educational program will
result from this pioneer eﬁ'ort in
adopting the Trimester Calendar
Plan. ' '
Grayson Kirk, president of
Columbia University, writing
for» the Saturday Evening Post,
praised the trimester college
plan “as ‘feasible as it is impera-
tive.” '

“There should be no artiﬁcial
barriers that prevent‘ a superior
student from realizing the maxi-
mum of his potential,” he said.
“Financial obstacles have been
leveled by loans and scholarships.
The one remaining hindrance is
the time factor, an anachronism in
a jetrpropelled age.”

Bernis Believes
Weather Allows :

' Greater Scope

With the university usual
spring - sports scheduled to
end in May, the Athletic Die‘-’
‘oartment is planning an ex-_
tended intramural program, '
to meet the physical needs of I
studentg attending the third tri-j
mester. ‘

“Since the weather will be in 
our favor, we will be able to hold 
a greater variety of activities.”

“Of course, much of 'our pro-
gramming will depend on the in-
terest of the students,” Intramuralii-
Director Leo Bemis commented. ,

Among the tournaments Bemis
has planned are softbal1,Atennis,,
horseshoes, badminton, volleyball -
-and swimming. He also reported .:
that the fencing and barbell club's ..

would function during the third at
term. ' . .

Most of the action will take
place at Ellsworth Field and the ,
Field House. “We are going to’ -
put tennis courts in the Field
House,” Bemis said. “This will
accommodate students who wish
to take part in the tennis pro-
gram.”

Trophies and medals will‘ be 
_awarded to the winners of tourna-Q A
ments. 

These athletic possibilities are
open to. all fulltime students,”
Bemis reported. “Anyone can‘ or--, . -.
ganize a team andlplay. Weare ' I
hoping that the students will take ”
advantage of our increased ath-"~*
letic intramural facilities.” A _.

Lewis Plans

Wirth,. Conti Saturday

By JACK

SIVIITH

This season the Panther mitters appear to have both
strength and speed, but Coach,Bobby Lewis’ baseball nine
will get a baptism of ﬁre when they open their diamond cam-
paign in a doubleheader with Allegheny College Saturday at
Wildwood. The ﬁrst game of the twinbill ‘will start at 1:00

p.m. 9
The Panthers didn’t meet Alle-
gheny last year, so the only sure
thing Lewis knows about his op-
position is that their coach is Bob
Garbach, fornier Yankee catcher.

The starting pitchers for the
Cats in the doubleheader will be‘
colcaptains Dick Wirth and Bob
Conti. The probable starting line-
up will ﬁnd second baseman Pete

After only two weeks of prac

Panther forward wall should be
one of the best in the country.

Last year the Panthers were

Navy appears to have as strong a

 Osiier to Perform

 

 

The university library has recently received the gift of
a valuable manuscript collection. The collection, the Sheldon
Papers, were presentedby Mr. Ernest C. Miller of Warren,

Pa-

The documents were written by members of a Utopian
socialist community that existed along the boundary be-

tween Warren County,
Chautauqua County, New York,
from 1853-1863.

The people of this settlement
were spirituaists and believed that
the great men and women of
earlier ages were guiding them
toward the realization of a new
social order.

Some of their ideas were: a
perpetual motion machine, the
curing of disease by “magnetic
waters,_” world federalism, femi-
nine emancipation, marriage re-
form, and the manufacture of
sewing machines.

Mr. Miller, who donated this‘

gift, is vice-president of the West
Penn Oil Co. of Warren, Pa. He is
the author of John Wilkes Booth,
Oilman, and is a frequent con-
tributor oo the Western Pennsyll-
vania Historical Magazine.

A descriptive history of the
Sheldon Papers was written last

,' year by Mr. Russell Duino, ‘ad-

ministrative assistant to the

uni-
versity librarian. -
