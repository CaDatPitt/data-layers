In an attempt to settle a dispute over his
retirement package, former Pitt President
Wesley W. Posvar has agreed to give over
a million dollars in retirement beneﬁts
back to the university, according to
Saturday’s Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

The agreement is tentative, and the Pitt
Board of Trustees is expected to vote on
it sometime next week.

If the board approves it, Posvar’s

Pitt students will have the opportunity
to interact one on one with representatives
from different fields and professions at the
Career Seminars this week.

A “What is unique is the idea that it is
helpful for students to talk to people in
various careers, not just for information of
the career but for a chance to really
identify with someone who's actually in
the field doing it,” said Teddy Fakles, the
supervisor of the four-day‘ seminar and a
career counselor.

The seminar also helps students find out
more about themselves and their interests,
according to Fakles. '

Posvar will tentatively return    

retirement package will be cut to $3.3
million. He will be giving back, as a
donation, $740,000 in low-interest
mortgages, as well as $100,000 in a life-
insurance policy that the university, had
paid for.

He will also take an annual salary cut of
$60,000, bringing his annual pay to
$160,000. When and how he will pay the
money back has not yet been determined.

‘There has been a dispute over Posvar’s
retirement beneﬁts since June. Some of
the trustees feel ‘ Posvar did not fully

“The question I am asked most often is
‘What’s out there?”’ Fakles said. '

All seminars will be held in the William

representatives from 61 graduate’ and
professional schools, including law schools
and master’s of business administration

The seminar on Tuesday is targeted for
students interested in law, government or

City continues to face  
serious blood shortage

By Barbara Hoffmann
For The Pitt News

Central Blood Bank is still facing
a blood shortage despite the
increase in donations over the
past week, according to
spokesperson»Terri Glueck the
media attention gathered by the
blood bank has helped but efforts
have not stopped the shortage,
she said.

Future projections estimating
the blood supply are based on
individual appointments and
scheduled blood drives. These
projections reveal an inadequate
supply of blood throughout the
rest of this month and most of
next month. About 4,000 donors,
who each are allowed to donate
one pint, are needed in the next
few days, she said.

The supply most likely will not
stabilize until the end of October,
according to Glueck.

Glueck said donations have
dropped off nationwide this
summer and the country has been
sliding into a blood shortage since
June. ,

Hospitals have not been asked
to cancel elective surgeries, but
this is a possibility if the supply
becomes too low, Glueck said.

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Monday, September 23, 1991

 

Provost’s committee works for Women’s concerns

By Gena McCarthy
For The Pitt News

‘The Provost's Advisory
Committee on Women's Concerns
deals with Pitt’s sexual-

. harassment policy, on-campus_

child care and family-leave
policies. .

According to Anne Levenson,
chairperson of PACWC and
associate dean of the College of
General Studies, “PACWC is
unique since we have no specific
charge. It’s'up _to the group to
decide which issues we will focus
on."

PACWC consists of 33 faculty
and staff members and one
student who meet 10 times a
year. The group spans the
university spectrum, with
representatives from the medical
school, the School of Public
Health and the regional campus
at Greensburg.

PACWC does not yet have a
detailed agenda for the coming
year. “You're dealing with an
extremely competent, bright,
high-powered group of ladies,”

Levenson said. “When the group
meets, they discuss which topics
to pursue.”

The group is working to
improve on-campus child-care
availability. Currently,‘ the
university provides some child
care at Belleﬁeld Annex, but there
is no inexpensive facility
furnished by Pitt for students,
staff and faculty members.

PACWC wants cheaper, greater
availability of child care on
campus. “Of course who pays for
it is a problem. The university has
financial difficulties,” according
to’ Dr. Elizabeth Baranger, a former
member and an administrator and
professor at the physics
department. Baranger is PACWC’s
liaison at the provost’s office.

Past issues have included the
sexual-harassment policy, child-
care availability on campus,
family-leave policy ‘and a
“Promotion of Women
Workshop.”

PACWC offers a variety of
programs and services for women.
"Navigating the Tenure Stream”
is a special 9 program which

concerns untenured women
faculty. PACWC also interviews
candidates for major. university
positions, including last year's
search for a new president.

PACWC prepares an annual
Directory of Women Faculty,
yearly conferences for women
graduates and professional
students and conferences for
women undergraduate students.
They always co—sponsor an
annual reception for women as
well.

Levenson and Baranger agree
that PACWC was inﬂuential in
the formation of Pitt’s current
sexual-harassment policy. “It’s
certainly an improvement over
what it was," Baranger said.

The current policy, created in
October 1986 and revised in
October 1989 defines sexual
harassment and lists informal and
formal resolutions for it

Levenson said that it’s important
for everyone to know this policy.
This includes the perpetrators and
the victims. “Victims of sexual
harassment need to know they
don’t have tohput up with this

behavior. They can be protected,”
she said.

Although PACWC has sent
recruitment letters to student
organizations in the past asking
them to nominate people, PACWC
has only one student member.

Levenson thinks student input
is important but “students are
incredibly busy creatures. It can
also be intimidating to be in a
room full of older women."

Levenson strongly encourages
students to become involved with
PACWC and urges them to Contact
her if they are interested.

Although PACWC is not an
independent operation with the
power to create change, it can be
influential in effecting change.
PACWC focuses on an issue,
researches, discusses and
ultimately prepares a position
paper on it. '

In this paper, PACWC may
propose courses of action to
groups with the authority to follow
through on them. “We can tell

THE PI'IT NEWS, Monday, September 23, 1991

Writing prof serves as mentor

By Christine Hanna
For The Pitt News

Patsy Sims has wanted to be a
writer since the third grade.

Sims, associate director of Pitt’s
English writing program, became
a writing teacher because she
thought it was a more stable
profession than free—lance writing.

“The students that you have.

really want to write  I ﬁnd that
there is a lot of enthusiasm ... Iget
very involved with my students,”
she said.

After she was offered a full-
time position at Pitt, she was
worried about not having a
chance to write, but the English
department is very supportive of
its writers and wants them to be
good teachers as well, she said.

Sims said, “I think that having
working writers to teach writing
classes is very important because
I think students learn a lot by
example.”

Sirns_said that James Agee is
one of her favorite writers. “He is
a beautiful literary journalist,” she
said.

She also likes to read William
Faulkner and two writers for the
New Yorker, Jane Kramer andjohn
McPhee.

“Even now, at my age, I still
have mentors. I think I’m a mentor
to other people  There is also a
lot of giving among a lot of writers
 something I hope to carry on,
and I hope that my students, after
they’ve gotten their feet on the
ground, remember that somebody
else helped them and continue
the tradition of helping other
people,’.’ Sims said.

Sims said her father, an avid

reader, unknowingly influenced‘

her to become a writer. Later in
her life she found out that her
father had also wanted to write.

She hails from New Orleans,
La., but she was born in
Beaumont, Texas.

Sims is a graduate of Tulane
University in New Orleans. When
she entered college, her goal was
to write fiction, but that changed.

When she decided on her
major, she chose journalism so
she would be sure to _have a job.
“I ended up loving it and staying
with it,” Sims said.

Once she received her degree,
she went into the newspaper
business and has worked for three
newspapers. She has been an
editor and done investigative,
feature and hard—news reporting.

In 1974 she began free-lance
writing and working on a non-
fiction book. She has three books
published and is working on two
more. R

Her novels are all based on her
reportings on the South. Her first
novel, The Klan, was based on

the Ku Klux Klan.

Cleveland Benjamin '3 Dead,
her second book, was about
southern Louisiana sugar-cane
workers whose ancestors were a
part of slavery. The third book,
Can Somebody SboutAmen, was
written from information collected
from 10 religious revivals.

Now she is writing a novel
which takes place on a Texan
prison farm in the 19405. It is
about a friendship between an
11-year-old girl and an old man
with a life jail sentence.

Sims said that the plot is fictional
but is based on one of her
childhood experiences. “ M y
grandfather worked on a prison

farm  I got to know this guy
who ran the prison post office,
and this is the basis of the old
man in the book. When I was
seven, he sent me what I
considered my first big book  I
always wanted to do something
about him,” Sims said.

In 1982 she began to feel A
insecure about her future as a
free-lance writer.

She said she had toyed with the
idea of teaching and then decided
it would give her security, she
would be teaching something she
really liked and cared about and
she would still be able to write on
her own.

The University of Maryland
offered her a fellowship to work
on a master’s degree in rhetorical
criticism. “It really helped me as
a writer,” she said.

After receiving her master’s, ,

she taught at the‘University of
California in San Diego, Austin
Peay State College in Clarksville,
Tenn., and Pacific Lutheran
University in Washington.

Sims has an apartment in
Pittsburgh but also commutes
between here and ‘Washington,
D.C., a four and a half hour drive.

When she is not writing,’
teaching or commuting, she said
that she sees friends and spends
time with her cat and dog, Sam
and Maggie. .

Sims said she also enjoys
collecting antiques, and she
collects old typewriters and
Corkscrews. “There are always
many more things that I want to
do than I have time to do,” she
said. ‘ '

“I’ve always been ambitious
and determined," Sims said.

Budget crunch cuts ethnic studies staff down

By Kathy Meyer
For The Pitt News

The state-funded Pennsylvania
Ethnic Heritage Studies Center,
supported by Pitt for the
preservation of cultural diversity,
will be down to a skeleton crew
of one person because of budget
cuts.

The center employs two
people, including Director Joe
Makarewicz, but his assistant is
leaving in October to start a new
job. _

He doubts he will be able to
hire a new assistant because

TOUCH OF .OLD

funding for the center was recently
cut by 50 percent.

He said the budget cut is
crippling the center’s ability to
respond to requests for services
but added that some private
funding is available through grants
from groups like the Pennsylvania
Humanities Council and the
National Endowment for the
Humanities.

Makarewicz said the basic
objective of the center is to “help
to promote an understanding and
appreciation of the multicultural
character of the state and to find
ways of preserving that

multiculturalism.”

Makarewicz has spent
numerous hours in workshops
and seminars helping teachers
incorporate multiculturalism into
their curriculum. , _

Although its services are
available to anyone, the center
concentrates mainly on educating
teachers through workshops
about the many ethnic cultures
found throughout the state.

The center prepares an
instructional workbook for the
teachers and then works with
them in finding ways to
implement the material into the
classroom.

Makarewicz noted that the
center “doesn't advocate the
teaching of black history or Asian
history, but rather we try to inspire
teachers and students to look at
as many different groups as are
feasible and appropriate to the
thing they are studying at the
time.”

He suggests that if teachers are
studying Japanese history in their

social studies classes, that they
should incorporate Japanese
ideas about art into their art
programs.

There are two workbooks
available, one each for elementary
and secondary instructors.

Each school district is sent a
complimentary copy of each, and
teachers can purchase their own
copies for $15.

Makarewicz said the
workbooks contain information
on constructing family trees.

He said it is important for
students to learn about and
understand their own ethnic
backgrounds first before they
can learn about other cultures
without developing negative
stereotypes. S

Makarewicz said the problem
with stereotypes is that
“they frequently become
negative or are associated with
everybody in the group, and
therefore cause students to refuse
to recognize individual
differences."

"Yet, there are characteristics
of different groups. You don’t
have to like it, but you do have to
tolerate it,” he said.

Although the center’s primary
concern is preserving and
promoting ethnicity, in
Pennsylvania, any study of the
state must reﬂect the rest of the
country because “what happens
in other places affects people
here.” ' A

The center, part of the
University of Pittsburgh's
University Center for
International Studies, was
founded in 1975 by an act of the
state legislature.

It is funded entirely by the

. state, with some non-financial

support coming from UCIS.

UCIS provides the center with
access to scholars and university
facilities, such as. areas for
Makarewicz to hold workshops
and conferences.

The Pennsylvania Ethnic
Heritage Studies Center is located
at 405 Belleﬁeld Annex.

role is to oversee the university
and approve recommendations
made by the administration,
according to Lewis Popper,
secretary of the Board of Trustees
and general counsel of the
University of Pittsburgh.

According to the trustees’
handbook, the board is also
responsible for advancing the
purposes of the university,
promoting its academic integrity
and enhancing and preserving its
assets.

It delegates general
administrative, academic and
management authority to the
president but retains ultimate
responsibility for all affairs and
directly reserves its power in three
areas: selection of the president,
approval of major institutional
policies and defining the mission
and goals of the university.

The Board of Trustees is
comprised of 48 members, 36 of
whom are voting members. The
voting members are divided into
four categories: commonwealth,
charter, alumni and term trustees.

Four of the 12 commonwealth
trustees are chosen by the
governor, four by the speaker of
the state house and four by the

. president. of the Senate of the
Commonwealth.

The term of a commonwealth

trustee lasts four years, and each

year three leave and are replaced.

There are six alumni trustees
chosen by the Alumni Association.
There are 12 charter trustees, one
of whom is the president of the
university. The remaining six
voting trustees are term trustees,
who are chosen by the trustees
based on the recommendations
of the nominating committee.

Last summer charter trustees
John Arthur and Richard Beall
resigned, and they have yet to be
replaced. The board is awaiting
the report of the ad hoc committee
on the structure and operation of
the board, which is reviewing
both the size and organization of
the board as well as the selection
process for new trustees.

One of the governor’s
commonwealth trustees is a
student, whose term lasts for four
years. Medical student Paul J.
Chappano currently holds this
position.

The remaining 12 trustees are ‘

non-voting members and have
terms that last for three years.
Each year four leave and are

‘everything’

replaced, allowing a regular
turnover of their membership.
These trustees are nominated by
the president and elected by the
board.

Other members ex-officio
include the governor of the
commonwealth, Robert P. Casey;
the mayor of Pittsburgh, Sophie
Masloff and the secretary of
education of the commonwealth,

Donald Carroll Jr.
The Board must have a
chairperson and a vice

chairperson, according to its
charter. John C. Marousfformer

Westinghouse, is the chairperson
of the Board of Trustees.

'The first vice chairperson is

It’s difficult for Levenson to know for certain how inﬂuential

making the policies know how inﬂuential we are,” she said. “But
we do believe that on specific issues, we have significant input.
This is a responsible job.”

Operations such as selection of

number of comments on how the
board should be changed ..
Yolanda Barco has had these
types of comments since she
became a trustee [in 1990],”
Popper said.

“Senator Scanlon has a lot of
skill in the area of keeping
perspective. He’s not jaded just
because he’s on the board. He is
a legislator, and part of his job is
to keep some perspective on
how things look to the people.
Another example is Richard
Simmons  his role at Pitt is a
small part of his professional life,
and I don’t see that it could jade
him."

The committee has just
undertaken a major project to
interview officers, staff, faculty
and students at Pitt, officers at
other universities and former
administrators and alumni.

To help conduct these
interviews, the committee has
chosen a new faculty member so
that they “will get other views.
They speciﬁcally hired a new
faculty member who has not been
here long because they didn’t
want someone who already had
a set of views about the runnings
of the board," Popper said.

"I think when it's all said and
done, they will have a better
perspective," he said.

This faculty member is Anthony
Jones of the School of Education.

The committee did consider
hiring an outside consultant to
help with its duties but decided it
was more important to have
someone who was familiar
with the board of trustees’

operations.

Reclaiming African history in classroom

An untruth is an untruth, whether it is
deliberate or the result of ignorance. In our
society, school is often considered the ideal

», place where one can obtain “a knowledge of
truth.” Ironically, many of the lies which
people have accepted as truths are circulated

" and perpetuated within the walls of our very
own institutions of learning. For example,
 throughout my school years, beginning with
jmy elementary school days, I have been lied
 IO.

  ‘In the fourth grade I was taught that
Christopher Columbus discovered America;
i today I know that this is not true for a number
. or reasons, one of them being that ancient
 Africans had voyaged to North America cen-
:=i‘f'i‘-turies prior to 1492 and left behind extensive
W-‘architectural ‘evidence. In the ninth~~grade I
 «was taught that the ancient Greeks" revolu-
 tionized ' mathematics; today I know that
 ancient Africans were utilizing geometry and
hycvalculus to build pyramids long before the
.4; days of Pythagoras. I am currently a third‘-year
 undergraduate who has been enlightened: by

 
   
  
  
  
  
 

however, the lies continue. 1 v ' .

,_ _ Throughout the centuries history has truly
,ived,.upvto the meaning of its name: HIS-
STORY. In our schools history is traditionally
taught reﬂecting the perspective of the Eu-

 ropean male and teaches that it was the
j7fEuropean who, from the beginning of time,
 ttolonized, civilized and cultivated the world
 around us. European history has‘ subjectively
 undermined the accomplishments of African
 {peoples from all over the world as well as the

JoAnn Thomas

accomplishments of all people of color. For-
tunately many African people (such as my-
self) have come in contact with the “knowl-
edge of truth” that publishers deliberately
exclude from the pages of their textbooks.
African history has revealed to us the
falsehood and evil that ﬁttingly characterizes
most of European history and has shed great
light upon all of its inaccuracies. African
history credits our “real forefathers” for their
major contributions to world civilization
throughoutall areas of study and teaches us
the truth about how this knowledge was
usurped and ruthlessly claimed by Europe-

V ans. _Most ,importantly, African history has

issued __a unique sense of esteem and con-

sciousness to a suffering people whose his-r
, tory is said to havebegun on the cotton ﬁelds 
, of ’ plantations —— not at the glorious pyramids I 1

in Egypt. " '

  Overall, knowledge ofAfrican':his_torIy.has-.  
given me a heightened, awareness of myself "i:
and my .. people‘ as Swell‘-I as ‘a vbroadened 
’realizat'ion.of boththe immediate and remote :
worlds surrounding me. However, now that .
I am fully awareof the existencesi of 
“false” and “true” history, Iface a dilemma; as 
do: many collegians of 'Afri‘c,an" des_ce‘nt.jWe ‘ 1
are repulsed by the fact that many of the lies} . ..
' that have disgraced our history are still dis- »-
persed throughout the_ world -of academia, 2

thus perpetuating the existence of false his-
tory in the classroom and beyond. Although
we are dedicated to reclaiming the history of
our people, what are we to do when daily we

are placed in a disciplinary situation from .

which we must reap, internalize and ﬁnally

apply the false knowledge that is taught by '

our professors? Should we rather agree to

accept dire consequences such as failing grades ’

or even no degree?

Hence, the problem lies here: How does a
black medical student psychologically cope
with a false curricula that stresses that

Hippocrates is the “father of medicine” when ’

the studentmayknow this title is truly held by
Imhotep (whom the Greeks referred to as
Aescalapius)? How does myrespect formy

Financial crisis and hard times atthe BCCI

In these troubled economic times,
financial security is crucial. Not to
worry, though. Plenty of places are
willing to take your money and
keep it warm for you until your
kids go to college or you finally see
that incredible Varmint X-500 Turbo
Convertible that you just have to
have or else you'll die.

Whichever comes first.

Anyway, one of these esteemed
money vaults is the BCCI. That
stands for Bank of Cold Cash. All of
its big investors, though, know it as
the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.

Adam
Richter

For some reason, lots and lots of
people are taking their money out
of the BCCI, so you know there’ll
be plenty of room for your cash.
But, you should learn some things
about this bank.

First of all, according to the Sept.
12 Pittsburgh Press, it was
“founded by Pakistanis, owned by
Persian Gulf investors and based in
Luxembourg."

I can't think of any place where
my money would be safer. For one
thing, Luxembourg is populated

"completely by French people, who

ha_ve.never been known to rob a
bank. The only way a Frenchman

could threaten Luxembourg is if it

was ruled by a short temperamen-
tal guy in an oversized coat.
Apparently the bank has a cruel
sense of humor, too. Why, just last
week Clark Clifford testified — I
mean, said — that BCCI fooled him
into handing over control of his
company, First American
Bankshares, Inc., back in 1982.

‘   *3 .. ,.«.-’.-*‘ 
>"-' 4 ‘u.’ ‘t 1' .
.52’.-I  1%‘ #1‘

  

None of the details were given, but
I think it had something to do with
a cutthroat game of “Go Fish.” The
transaction went like this:

Clifford: “Do you have any twos?”

BCCI resident Card Sharla “Go
fish. Do you have any American
holding companies?"

Cliﬂ'ord- “Here.”

It probably involved a lot more
than that, but I think that’s the
general idea.

You’re probably wondering,
“What does the Bank of Cold Cash
want with another bank?" Well,
banking is a complicated business,
especially when you are an inter-
national bank. You see, when you
put your money in the bank, they
take that money and spend it on
things like toasters and calendars
and hope that you won’t mind.

International banks have it espe-
cially rough. They have customers
from all over the world, which
means that their automated teller
machines have to be able to dis-
pense in more than just $5 and $10
denominations.

The BCCI, on the other hand,
was allegedly taking its depositors’
money and putting it into things
like drugs and terrorists.

Another drawback is that the
American Express card that the
BCCI hands out to customers isn't
accepted at K-Mart stores.

Well, maybe putting your money
in the BCCI isn’t such a good idea
after all. But there aren't many safe
investments anymore. After all, in
these troubled economic times, fi-
nancial security is crucial, whether
or not you have a toaster.

Waiting for   Godo’Connor

Students host president while he lobbies against theme

One late summer afternoon I
stopped in the Schenley Cafe for a
quick bite to eat before work.
Breaking from the sweltering heat
and barely tolerating my chicken-

‘salad sandwich, I noticed a distin-

guished man across the room.

I noticed him right away. .

He sat with three other men, but
there was something different about
him. His warm presence was
powerful. I thought, “Wow, Dr. J.
Dennis O’Connor seems like a real
down-to-earth guy.”

O’Connor impressed me. Here
sat the president of the university
eating student grub. He wasn't
afraid to leave his office. You could

reach out and touch him. He was

right in front of me.

I wanted to walk over, sit down
next to him, engage in conversa-
tion and say, “Tell me, will you
allow discriminating groups to
remain on campus?” But I-didn’t. I
went-to work. And now I wonder.

answer?
The next time that I saw Dennis

Mark Smith  

O’Connor, he was opening Pitt’s .

Diversity Celebration. He arrived
late, spoke for under a minute and
sat down promptly. That was it; no
words of wisdom. I expected a
profound speech on the virtues of
the academy, yet his distance still
made me curious. I wanted to get
inside his head, know what he was
thinking. He looked distracted from
the fair.

Maybe he was thinking about
$13,000 drapes? Maybe he was
thinking about forming a president’s
select committee on Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual concerns like Rutgers
University’s president did. Or
maybe he was thinking, “Who the
hell is that wearing a green militant
homosexual bumper sticker on his
shirt?"

With that green sticker on my
shirt, I should have walked up to
him and asked, “Dr. O’Connor,

what are your hopes, dreams, goals
or aspirations? Who are you?” But
I didn’t.

Finally, I thought that I might
have the chance to speak with this
elusive man on Wednesday, Sept
18. Late in the afternoon our Stu-
dent Government Board sponsored
a reception for student leaders to

_ meet Dr. O’Connor.

I could have gone representing a
certain student organization which
will remain nameless. Yet for some
reason, I passed on the invitation.

For the hell of it, I stopped by the
reception because I had to ask
someone inside a question. It was
a good reason to see the man. In
the Kurtzman Room, a close rela-
tive and a friend told me Dr.
O’Connor’s plane was delayed. He
was in Harrisburg.

“Harrisburg!”

I made some flippant remark:
“What’s he doing in Harrisburg —
lobbying against students on the
right to know legislation?” You
could imagine my reaction to the
next day's headline in 777ePt'ttNews.

The headline read “Cowell Bill [the
right to know bill] Unnecessary,
O’Connor Tells Senate.” Guess I

award. Snap!

SGB spent hundreds of dollars-
on overpriced cheese cubes (ex-
ample $50 per plate of bland cheese

chunks). University catering’

charges an arm and a leg for even

And there was a room of students
standing, waiting and going no-
where. I had to laugh.

on refumishing his office and home.
Although Pitt’s bureaucracy‘ is justifying this
expenditure, the truth of the matter is that Pitt
students are outraged. I just got back from a
night class where a professor raised this issue,
and nearly every student came out of a 5:45-
8:10 coma and started slamming O’Connor. '
Forget about the arguments over whether the
money should have been spent or not and
where the money is coming from. The point is
that O’Connor is a man who billed himself to
students as Mr. Down-to-Earth, Mr. Let’s-wear-

flannel-shirts-and-hang-out—at-the-SOD-on- _

wing-night.This guy told us he was our friend
and that he was for us.

a complete restructuring of the
present education system to make
it ‘less Eurocentric. Nevertheless,
what must first occur is an utter
denouncement of the distorted,
incredulous history that is accepted
and taught in our learning institu-

miseducating us if they continue
to propagate lies and false doc-
trine. ,

Clearly, Europeans refuse to ef-

face the lies in their textbooks, .
because along with an emergence

of truth would surface a harsh
reality. If they remove the lies in
their textbooks, they will be forced
to rearrange their holiday celebra-
tions, their customs, etc., thus
obliterating generations of Euro-
pean history and culture. Although
Europeans fear an educational
revolution, we (African people) on
the other hand, should not. All
African people must benefit from
an education system that permits
us to unshamefully identify with
ourselves and allows us to ac-
knowledge the endless wonder of

our people.

Conclusively, we, must actively
ﬁght our struggle to reclaim the
history bestowed upon us by our
ancestors, for inactivity is apathy.
Therefore, debate your professors
who know the truth but choose not

The Pitt volleyball team, which lost six matches all of lastseason,
lost its ﬁfth match of this season to Western Michigan Friday, before
coming back to win against American Saturday.

Four of the five losses have come since senior co-captain Sue
Zonneville was out with mono. Her status will be determined at an
examination Tuesday, and she may return for Pitt’s next match,
Oct. 4 at Seton Hall.

Western Michigan came into the match at Fitzgerald Field House
with a 7-2 record but had lost its last two in a row. The Panthers took
advantage of a shaky Bronco defense to win the first game 15-13
but then lost the second game 15-11.

The Panthers seemed to take control of the match in the third
game, taking a 9-0 lead, but they weren’t able to close it out, as
‘ Western Michigan scored the next 10 points. Once Pitt let the

Broncos back into the match, they seemed to have problems with
their much-larger opponents, as the Broncos won the third game
A 15-11 .

“I think we lost some confidence the weekend before [when the
team lost three of four matchesl,” said Coach Sue Woodstra. “We’re
working to get it back right now.

Western Michigan went" on to win the fourth game 15-9.

“We lost our intensity, ”said co-captain Dee MacAulay. “In
volleyball you never really know what’s going to happen.”

Ann Marie Lucanie lead the Panthers in digs and kills, with 20 of
each, but she had 13 errors. Linda Zols had 13 kills, and MacAulay
had nine kills and 16 digs.

The ball is set and spiked; a sprawling
Dee MacAulay dives for it but comes up
short. Instead of showing frustration, the
senior co-captain simply picks herself up
and smiles.

“It helps the team,” MacAulay said of her
smiles. “We had a good rally. Why be down
on ourselves?”

That attitude prevails on the Pitt volleyball
team and is shown by MacAulay game after
game, match after match.

A confident MacAulay has lettered three
straight years for the Panthers. Along with
co-‘captain Sue Zonneville, MacAulay is
expected to provide key leadership.

By Christopher Block
Stat)" Writer

The Pitt varsity soccer team
should have seen it as an omen—
a bad omen.

Shortly before their Big East
contest against the Georgetown
Hoyas was supposed to begin,
Panther starting goalkeeper'Tim
Sobelman was asked to switch
uniform- jerseys. because his
original one looked too much like
the opposing team’s.

Things would not get much
better, as Pitt lost to the Hoyas, 4-
3.

Just four and a half minutes into
the opening half, the Hoyas
capitalized on a misplayed ball
by the Pitt defense and scored the
game’s first goal. Georgetown
senior forward Todd Colonna
carefully infiltrated the panther
defensive zone and ﬁred the shot
past Sobelman.

Later in the same half the
Panthers were again caught off
guard by a streaking Colonna,
who was able to slide in from the
left hash mark and fire a shot. It
tailed off wide of the net.

One of the brighter spots on
the Pitt offensive was the play of
first-year midfielder Eric Prex.
Prex led a two-on- four Panther

match to Georgetown

assault into the Georgetown zone,
where he narrowly missed tying

' the game.

Later he provided a good
displayof speed by chasing down
a defender and forcing the
opposing player_to slip the ball
out of bounds, setting up a Panther
corner kick.

At 21:05 in the first half Colonna
weaved through two defenders
on the left side of the goal mouth
and managed to free himself for a
pass.

He laced a pass to charging
teammate Dario Llado, who
smashed the ball past an out-
stretched Sobelman for the team’s
second score. .

Just seven minutes later the
Panthers were able to put together
a scoring drive of their own.

Ledby senior co-captain Nick
Liberati, the Panthers pressed into
the Georgetown zone and deftly
passed the ball to Prex, who

I booted the ball in.

With 8:59 remaining in the

' opening half, Pitt forward Don

Overmier grabbed a breakaway
pass and one-timed a quick shot
that ﬂew wide of the net.

A rejuvenated Panther squad

second half. Fresh off their

Canisius,-
stays perfect

By Bob Maselli
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther football team
isn’t the only team at this university
that is undefeated.

The Lady Panther tennis team
beat Canisius College 7-2
yesterday at the Charles L. Cost
Center, upping their record to 6-
0 on the season.

The match was decided very
early, when Pitt took all six singles
matches from the Golden Griffins,

' despite having tyvo team members
’ in ill health. Both Raquel Cepeda

and Erika Devins were battling
bad «colds throughout their
matches.

“I’m going home and sleeping
the rest of the day,” Cepeda said
after her 6-5, 6-1 win over Rachel
Hazetet in the third singles match.

Other singles victories for the
Lady Panthers came when Julie
LoPrinzi, enjoying her own
undefeated season, beat Leslie
Broodbelt 6-1, 6-0.

Devins defeated Molly Eberz
6-2, 6-4, andJenniferJacobs beat

Jennifer Latimer 6-4, 6-4. Hard-
hitting Colleen Kujawski beat
Krissi Lovier 6-3, 6-1, and Gwen
McIntyre stopped Jill Luther 6-2,
6-1.

“Our singles are playing great,
just great, ” said Pitt Coach George

Dieffenbach. “We have a much

tougher task ahead of us with our
next two opponents
[Youngstown State and Trenton
State], but we gain a certain degree
of confidence with each match
we play and win.” .

In doubles play Pitt dropped
two of three matches to Canisius
in pro-set play. Because the match
was decided after singles play,
both teams agreed to play pro-set
matches, whereas the first team
to win eight games, wins the
match. '

Canisius head coach General
Bass encouraged his team to “go
out and have fun” because they
had already lost, and his team did
just that. -

The team of Hazetet and Luther

{beat Pitt’s Andrea Passarello and

Kujawski 8-6, and Jodi Johnston
and Renee Rocchio danced and
defeated Josie Neiswenter and
Karen Rearick 8-3. The only
doubles win for the Panthers
came when the No. 1 team of
LoPrinzi and Devins defeated
Eberz and Louier. 1

“In the six matches we’ve
played in, we have shown a good
positive attitude about
everything," Dieffenbach said.
“We are really playing well. I’m
pleased.”

matches will be on Wednesday

Earlander Taylor and Kim Lee
both had strong matches for
Western Michigan. Taylor had 17
kills and a .309 kill percentage,
and Lee had. 15 kills, a .409
percentage and 16 digs. Tricia
Stragliotto, who led the Broncos
in kills and digs entering the
match, had 11 kills and a match-
high 22 digs.

Pitt suffered another personnel

loss as Lucanie, the team leader‘ 2'

in kills and digs, hurt her ankle.
She missed Saturday’s match but
is expected to return for the Seton
Hall match. I
The Panthers came out like they
were going to make quick work
of American, with senior Bridget
Gary starting in Lucanie’s place,
taking the first game 15-5.
Woodstra decided to take
MacAulay out of the match at that
point, replacing her with first-
year player Melanie Gustafson.
“This is where we can get the

experience. Dee’s not 100-
percent healthy [with a back
problem]. Mainly it is a chance to
get the younger players some
action." -

They took a big lead again but
struggled to close out the second
game before ﬁnally ending it on a
kill by Zols to make it 15-12.

Pitt came from behind to take a
12-8 lead in the third game but
gave up ﬁve straight to fall behind.
The Panthers had continually
gone to a hole in the left side of
American’s defense all game, but
American closed it with the score
13-14 on a long rally, which ended
with a Zols hitting error.

Game four went back and forth
and was tied 14-14 until American
took the lead and won it 16-14 on
a lift call. ‘

The fifth game was played by
rally score,‘ in which there are no
sideouts. Either team can score
on each point. Pitt made four
service errors but still won 15-12.

When asked why she kept

MacAulay out when things got
close, Woodstra replied, “They
[the younger players] need
experience in that situation, too,
when they have to fight hard for
the match.

“I think they’re doing OK,"

Woodstra said. “It takes time to '

get experience. They are working
hard. It takes time, andI have to
be patient with them."

It was a senior, Zols, who really
came through, with 21 kills, a .436
kill percentage and nine digs. Gary
had 14 kills and 12 digs, but she
had nine errors. Gustafson played
well, with eight kills and seven
digs.The win left the.Panthers’
record at 7-5 before Seton Hall.

“Last year we had several
injuries, too, but they didn’t
happen in an important part of
the season,” Woodstra said. “We
were lucky that we had some
easier matches coming up as that
happened. This year we haven’t
been as lucky. Every team goes
through (injuries).

\ halftime break, the Panthers began immediately
. trying to even the score.

It didn’t take too long. With only one minute
elapsed in the second half, Liberati smashed the
Hoyas’ defense with a simmering shot into the
back of the net, tying the game at two goals
apiece.

For the next 15 minutes the Panthers were
able to stand up to the Hoyas’ assault and were
also able to apply some strong pressure of their
own.

With 12:04 remaining in the contest,
Georgetown broke through and took the lead
for good. The Hoyas performed an excellent

passing array that led to senior forward Matt

Kopps scoring his ﬁrst goal of the season.

Three minutes later the Hoyas broke through
the Panthers’ defense again, and sophomore
midﬁelder Tim Keegan added the goal that put
Georgetown up 4-2.

Trailing by two goals, the Panthers were only

able to come up with a few more scoring

opportunities.

With 2: 11 remaining in the game, Pitt midﬁelder
Charlie Wasson volleyed a pass to fellow first-
year player Prex, who lofted the ball into the net
for Pitt’s ﬁnal goal.

Assistant coach Heinz Pak mentioned the play
of his stellar ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Prex. “Erik Prex
was a premier’ player in Pennsylvania last year,‘
and he has brought that level of play here.”

The loss dropped Pitt’s record to 3-1-1 and 0-

her junior year because of a
nagging back problem. “I pulled
a ligament in my back last year,”
MacAulay said. “I’m still not 100
percent, but it’s getting better.”

So far this year MacAulay has
111 kills and 127 digs, a consistent
effort both offensively and
defensively for a middle hitter.

“Consistent,” was Pitt head
coach Sue Woodstra’s feelings
about MacAulay. “She is very
versatile and a good athlete. Dee
can play anywhere on the court.
Her ball control is excellent,”
Woodstra said.

Having a great record a year
ago (32-6), the Panthers have
struggled early this season. After
a 5-1 start, Pitt’s record fell to 7-
5. But there is no need to worry,
reassures MacAulay. “We haven't
lost our conﬁdence,” MacAulay
said. “We have conﬁdence, and
we will bounce back.”

With six seniors on the team,
MacAulay likes Pitt’s chances for
another Big East title. “It is really
important for us to do well in the
Big East,” she said. “We will have
to beat Georgetown and Syracuse,
but I know we can win it.” _

MacAulay also knows that this

is her senior year and her last‘

year to beat Penn State. “We
really want to beat Penn State,”
MacAulay said. “It comes down
to who wants it more, and now
we want it more.” During
MacAulay’s career, Pitt has never
beaten the Nittany Lions. She
wants to make the most out of
her last chance.

Confidence abounds in
MacAulay. A conﬁdence that has
spread throughout the team. A
conﬁdence that puts a smile on
MacAulay’s face and ap frown on
the faces of her Opponents.

Young writers should aim high,
start at the top and work their
way down, she said.
“If you don’t set high goals for
yourself to work toward, you’re
never going to achieve as much

as you could have achieved. You
might not make it quite to that
top goal, that top rung that you
set, but you will have ’ gotten
higher up the ladder than if you

would have made your goal"

a gift. This would allow him to
receive the tax beneﬁts of a
donation. ‘

President of United Faculty
Philip K. Wion said the university
did the best it could under the
circumstances.

“Probably they were difficult
negotiations. I think that it is
good that the university has been
able to secure a significant amount
of money being given back.

Particularly important is the ,

money involved in special

mortgages and insurance policies.
I also think it is good that the
annual salary is not in excess of
$200,000. That’s a lot of money,-”
Wion said.

Student Government President
Brent‘ Saunders was pleased with
the settlement.

“I think it’s great. I don’t think
it makes a difference whether it’s
a gift or something he should
have done," he said.

"He is returning it on his own
and not going to court. I think it.
helps the university because we
don’t have to fight him in court
and incur any legal fees,” Saunders
said.

and she said ‘Just tell me you're having a wonderful time,’ and I said
‘I am having the most incredible time ever, because I am learning so
many things, I am doing so many things.’ It is definitely worth it! "
