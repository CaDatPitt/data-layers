Chest Drive  
Opens at Pitt
Next Week

Food and clothing for war-
stricken European college stu-
dents will be furnished by Pitt
students through contributions to
the Pitt Chest drive which begins
next Wednesday.‘

The aid will be administered

.through CARE, one of the six
charitable organizations helped by
the drive.

A non-proﬁt, government- ap-
proved cooperative of 26 leading
overseas relief agencies including
prominent Protestant, Catholic
and Jewish groups, CARE will
send their standard packages of
food, clothing, blankets, etc. to the
most needy European scholars.

The countries which are to be
included in the program are: Aus-
tria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czecho-
slovakia, Eire, Finland, France,
Greece, Britain, Italy, Nether-
lands, Norway,‘Poland, Hungary
and Germany.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower
in recommending this aid said,
“CARE packages are a tangible
person—to-person expression of
international brotherhood.”

Several colleges throughout the
country have already sent CARE
packages to European College stu-
dents with very successful results.

One Greek student who re-
ceived aid from an American col-
lege expressed his gratefulriess by
saying, “I want to express my
gratitude to your kindness in
sending me a CARE parcel. I am
a student of the Agricultural
School who is indigent and un-
employed. I am also a war vic-
tim having been arrested and tor-

I tured by the Nazi.”

CARE provides special selec-
tions of food for the different re-
quirements of the countries bene-
ﬁted. Kosher food packages are
also provided.

Each student is expected to con-
tribute $2, if possible, to the Chest
for this‘ and the ﬁve other worthy
charities.

Rippling Rhythm Has
Floor at Ball Tonight

Shep Fields will provide the dance music and the Modernaires
the intermission entertainment tonight at the International Ball to
be held at the Ches Arena in Cheswick, Pa. The price to all those
not holding “strip-tickets” is $3.25 per couple.

“Rippling Rhythm,” the kind of danceable music on which Shep
Fields built his reputation, will be featured by the smooth maestro
and his band.

Shep, who started at Erasmus Hall High School with his own
little band, has been and continues to be one of the all-time favorites
of people who like dance music that is both listenable and easy
to dance to.

Just how popular Shep Fields’ music is may be gauged from the
fact that his 40-week stay at Chicago’s famed Palmer House has
never been equalled. 9

In 1943 the" suave leader pur-
chased the Glen Island Casino
which he continued to operate
until 1946, when by popular de-
mand he brought back his “Rip-
pling Rhythm” to the current ﬁeld
of dance music.‘

The Modernaires, Columbia’s
top recording artists, also have
won national acclaim for their
work in motion pictures and ra-
dio. The group earned headliner

status not long ago with their
recordings of “Salute to Glenn

Miuef” and “T0 Each His Own-” the ground floor. No tickets will

On Festival Tomorrow *
Pitt Players will pull the “last laugh” out of Spring .Festival
tomorrow evening with their ﬁnal presentation of “The Would-Be
Gentleman” at 8:30. Last night’s opening show indicated that the
“Gentleman” may top Players attendance records for the year.
First-nighters were treated to three acts of Moliere’s wit garn-
ished with the antics of Murray Harris, Irving Sandson, Richard
Swierczyk, Ed Radasky, and a host of supporting players who keep
the play moving right through to the mock—serious Turkish cere-
mony in the third act.
Adding charm as well as wit are Ruth Schwartz, Cecilia Bodman,
Lenore Pinsker, and Anatalie Gefsky, while the Turkish scene blends
- 'A'Harris’s comic antics with an Ori-
ental dance best ‘described as se-
ductive, performed by Angela
Giallombardo and half-a-dozen
gauze-draped co-eds. Shirley Eckl
planned and directed the sequence.

Director Harvey Pope" is staging
the show as much as possible like
the seventeenth century produc-
tions of thepopular French com-
edy, although a few lines have
been altered to provide a modern
touch, and the dancing girls are
strictly 1948 models.

Tickets for shows tonight and
tomorrow night are $1 at the Stu-
dent Desk or the door, and 75
cents on the Spring Festival strip
ticket.

Although not sponsored by
Spring Festival, tonight’sl show
should draw a large audience,

judging from comments after the
premiere performance.

them all back to the farm with
him.

army shows, sketches for the cur-

‘rent London hit, “Sweetest and
Lowest,” and material for Beatrice

Upset Victory

Dean Carey’s homerun with two

men on in the sixth inning, and
superb relief pitching by Ira Mar-
shall gave the Phi Gams a sur-
prise 7-6 victory over favored
SAE, Tuesday at Trees Field. The
loss knocked SAE‘ out of ﬁrst place
in the frat league.

Extreme wildness on /the part
of Bob Hoffman, Phi Gam starting
hurler, gave SAE three runs in,
the ﬁrst -and third innings. Five
walks, four. singles and a double
in two and two-thirds innings
gave SAE a 6-2 lead, and forced
Hoffman out of the game.

Marshall then came in to shut-
out the losers. giving up only two
hits in his stay on the mound.

Meanwhile the Phi Gam’s kept

. pecking away at SAE pitcher Dick

Bentley, getting a run in the third
on a walk, a sacriﬁce, and a single.
Two walks and a double gave the
Gams another tally in the next
frame to make the score 6-4.

In the sixth Bob Minnic opened
with a walk. He was forced at
second by Rollie McPherson, but
Roger Garris was issued a free
pass to set the stage for Carey’s
Frank Merriwell homer.

ner’s ﬁrst pitching start with a

Pitt baseball fans today get their ﬁnal look ‘at West Virginia,
one of the better collegiate baseball teams in the district. The

A West Virginia’s record tells .a strange tale. The Morgantown

Virginia in the second outing. It
looked as though hard times were
ahead for Manager Steve Harrick.
But surprisingly enough, the
Mounties caught ﬁre and proceed-
ed to win their next ten games to
set a new streak record. for West
Virginia nines.

_. A key factor in the success story
of the Mountaineers has been the
pitching of Okey Ryan. Last year

This year, however, Okey has
‘hurled himself to the top—ranking

Right behind him are two other

plus a strong row of hitters, has
given Manager Harrick what is
probably the best baseball team in

6-5. As Pitt
Wins Second

Big Rudy I-Iudec notched his
ﬁrst win of the season on Tues-

day when he hung a 6-5 defeat on
Washington and Jefferson, putting

.the Prexies on a diet of seven hits.

A four—run outburst in the sixth
inning sent the Panthers on the
way to, their second straight tri-
umph and pitcher Jack Lemmer
on the way to the showers.

‘Pitt’s batting order did a com-
plete revolution, as the Panthers
sprayed out six hits in the big
frame. ' .

Jackie Snyder, Pitt leftﬁelder,
highlighted the inning by smack-
ing a long drive to left-center
ﬁeld. When centerﬁelders Chuck
Devic fell ﬂat on his face in pur-
suit of the ball, Snyder breezed
in for a home run.

Pitt gathered a total of ten hits,
with Snyder and Catcher George
Matich accounting for two each.

Ralph Mitterling’s heavy hitters,
Jim Couch and Art Barnes, were
weak sisters at the plate. Couch
fanned three times and got a
scratch single, while ‘Barnes went
hitless in ﬁve trips. .

The game was not without its
lighter side. Hampered by a mud-
dy ﬁeld, ﬂy-chasers and inﬁeld-
ers had a diﬁicult time remaining
Vertical. ‘_ _ A

Jackie Snyder, coming in for a
foul fly ball, almost descended into

Graduate Record Scores Here
From December Examinations

Scores for the December 1947, Graduate Record Exams have
been received by the Psychology department.

Students who did not leave a stamped self-addressed envelope
with the local examiner at the time of the test may receive their
personal copies by calling at the psychology department in Room
1617 C1. or by mailing a request.

Pitt students compared favorably with students from 100 other
colleges participating in the examination service.

Especially high, in comparison with national averages, were
‘scores in mathematics, sciences
and social studies.

Designed as an aid for students
in choosing further academic
work, the tests are especially val-
uable in showing deﬁciencies in
ﬁelds important for the student's
chosen work.

A second important use for the
Graduate Record scores is in gain-
ing recognition at professional and
graduate schools which demand
test records as a part of entrance
qualiﬁcation.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (IP) — A
new educational. opportunity, call-
ed the “Vagabond plan,” has been
instituted at the University of
Kansas City, according to an an-
nouncement by vice—president Dr.
Robert Mortvedt. ‘

Beginning with the current sem-
ester, any full-time student en-
rolled in the University will be
permitted to take advantage of the
“Vagabond plan,” under which the

I Canals Are Key

“'Ii':' three canals are seen in the
photographs to converge to one
point, they may be considered
man-made and therefore a sign
of life,” he explained.

The speaker listed two reasons
why the use of photography is
better in studying astronomy than
the human eye alone:

First, a photograph can record
a fainter object than an eye, be-
cause a photographic plate can be
exposed" for a longer period of
time.

Permanent Record

Second, photographs provide a
permanent record of what is seen
and are more accurate than the
best drawings.

Although the telescope will not
be ofiicially ready for use until
June or July, a few photographs
have already been taken to test
for distortions of the mirror in
various positions, according to Dr.
Russell. »
