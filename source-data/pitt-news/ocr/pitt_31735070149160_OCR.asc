The search for a cancer cure
stretches back to 1971 when the A

. “war on cancer” was declared by P

former President Richard Nixon
after signing the National Cancer
Act. -

A research team at Pitt’s Cancer
Institute can now boast a major
contribution toward winning the
“war” after experiencing notable
success in a clinical trial that used
avaccine to prevent colon cancer.
The study detailing the vaccine
was published in this month’s
edition of Cancer Prevention Re-
search. - C

Olivera Finn, who heads th
immunology department at Pitt’s
School of Medicine, invented the

new vaccine. Like any vaccine, ,

this one should trigger the body’s
natural immune response and help
it to produce antibodies against
the cancer. /

The antibodies formed by the
body due to the vaccine speciﬁcally
target and destroy cancer cells that .
harbor the MUC1 protein. MUC1
is the protein that’s responsible
for the survival and growth of the
cancer cells, _

The primary clinical trial for
the new vaccine consisted of 39
patients ranging from 40 to 70
years old who were at high risk of
getting cancer due to a history of
polyps — growths projecting from

  Tickets for Colbert go on sale hours early, sell out

There’s no limit to the number of stu-
dents who can watch “The Colbert
Report” on cable television, butwhen
it comes to seeing Stephen Colbertin
person, there are only so many tickets
to go around. .

Free student tickets to see popu-
larpolitical satirist Colbert appear at
the Carnegie Music Hall this Friday
were expected to be available at the
William Pitt Union Ticket Office last
Friday,Jan. 11, starting at 10 am. But
ticket sales began earlier, around 7:30
a.m., and by the appointed 10 a.m.
opening time, tickets were already

gone. The Carnegie Music Hall holds
1,900 seats. . I
Students who were hoping to at-

‘ tend the event were disappointed‘ the

tickets sold out so early.

“I think the general consensus is
that we’re pretty pissed,” Elizabeth
O’Karma, a freshman undecided
major, said of student reaction to the
early Ticket Ofﬁce opening.

Thomas Misuraca, the assistant
director of Student Life and the fac-
ulty adviser for Pitt Program Council,

, offered an explanation for the confu-

sion. .

Misuraca said the Ticket Oﬂice
at the WPU.usually opens at 10 a.m.,
but that by the time 7:30 a.m. came

around, the line for Colbert tickets

‘ was so long that he made the decision

to open the doors earlier. Misuraca
said thatheknewthe linewas only go-
ing to get longer, and given the rainy
weather conditions, he didn’t want
the line to ﬁle all the way outside.
“Given the amount of people in the
building, we decided to open early so
as to not make them wait in line for
two and a half hours}’ he said.
Misuraca pointed out that the
same number of people would have
been ahead of a new ticket seeker if
the box office had opened later. In-
stead of having to wait two hours to
ﬁnd out the event was sold out, he
said, students in line found out im-

mediately.

“We could let those people stand
there until 10 and wait another two
hours until the ticket office opened,
or we could let them get on with their
lives and make things more conve-
nient for them,” Misuracasaid.

“There weren’t special privileges
given to anybody.”

Barry Porter, a freshman civil en-
gineering major, said he was initially
fairly angry that the tickets had sold

out; but he rationalized the decision‘

to open the box oﬂice early.

“Ultimately though, since there
were so many people waiting, I don’t ’

The streets of New York just weren’t safe
enough without his contributions to the Spe-
cial Victims Unit, so Pitt students will now
have to wait to see Ice-T.

An Evening With Ice-T, hosted by Pitt
Program Council, was originally scheduled
forjan. 13 at 7 p.m. in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room but had to be postponed
after the actor had a scheduling conflict.

Torn Misuraca, Pitt’s director of student
activities, said Ice-T was forced to reschedule
because of ﬁlming for “Law 8: Order: Special
Victims Unit,” on which he plays Detective
Odaﬁn “Fin” Tutuola.

Although he couldn’t cite an exact date,
Misuraca said PPC was working with Ice—T’s
publicist to reschedule the event.

The event attracted immediate interest
from Pitt students. On Facebook, 240 people
have indicated that they plan to attend the
free event. I

think it would’ve mattered too much if they start-
ed selling them early or not. The line would’ve
just been longer,” Porter said.

For future events, Misuraca noted that event
organizers will announce the time the box office
opens with a warning that if the circumstances
require it, the box office will open earlier.

“We do that for the convenience and safety
of our students,” Misuraca said.

Misuraca said that two of the problems creat-
ing the conditions that led to the early distribu-
tion were having only one distribution point and
the lack of technology to put the tickets through
an online system.

According to Misuraca, the Pitt Program
Council, which is collaborating with the Uni-
versity and the Swanson School of Engineering

to host the event, was faced with the Carnegie
Music Hall-— which only houses 1,900 seats —

as its only option for an event venue.

 “We really and truly want to do what’s best
for our students and make it as easy and conve-
nientaspossible,” said;_‘_‘Qtﬂy so many
people can go. We ;_:_—.:m'*t guarantee everyone a
ticket.”    f    

Colbert is visiting the University as part of
the prize earned injune by four Pitt engineering
students who won the “Colbert Super PAC Super
Fun Pack” challenge, a treasure hunt meant to
educate participants about campaign ﬁ1ndrais-
ing. His appearance at the Carnegie Music Hall
Friday will begin at 2 p.m., and doors will open
at 1 p.m. I

in the colon —— that were precancerous. The
results of the trial showed that the vaccine
was successful in 17 of the 39 patients.

These patients expressed an appropriate
immune response by producing antibodies
against any mutated forms of the crucial
MUC1 protein.

Dr. Nancy Davidson, director of Pitt’s
Cancer Institute and UPMC CancerCenter,
praised the study’s vision and success.

“It is a promising response that we can
build toward,” Davidson said.

Despite its initial success, there will still
be some time before this type of vaccine is
available to the general public. According
to Finn, a company still has to develop the

vaccine and get FDA approval to market it. 1

“Our job is just to show that the vaccine
is feasible and effective,” she said.

garner support for a larger trial to further
evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine.
But in order for another trialto take
place, Pitt’s researchers need to overcome
many hurdles. Finn said the FDA ﬁrst has to
grant approval for the vaccine as an inves-
tigational new. drug. The second step will
be seeking approval from the Institutional

Review Board that oversees participation

in research by human subjects and protects
their welfare.

The last step is ﬁscal support. Studies
such as these are paid for by governmental
grants or support from foundations. Both
the National Cancer Institute» and the Na;
tional Institutes of Health funded the study.

The research team will not stop short at
preventing just colorectal cancer.

Finn said that in May, the team will sub-
mit another grant to support a study that
will test a similar vaccine on patients who
are at high risk for pancreatic cancer due to
the presence of pancreatic cysts.‘

for the study and professor of medicine and
epidemiology at Pitt, could not be reached

some MENTAL

We still blame rape victims and We sun
    don’t really get Why that’ s bad

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Lizzy Seeberg, a freshman at St.
Mary’s College, committed suicide
two years ago after her allegations
of violent rape by a Notre Dame
football player made her the target
of threats from other students. The
player accused of assaulting her is
still on the roster alongside a team-
mate implicated in another rape
case, whose victim cites Seeberg
as a cautionary tale for why she
won’t come forward.

Last semester, Amherst Col-
lege came under scrutiny when a
former student wrote‘ that school
officials reﬁised to take her rape

"accusations seriously, then insti-
tutionalized her when she com-
plained of suicidal thoughts. A few
weeks ago, a young man from Ohio
State posted a video boasting that
his friends, many of them athletes
at Steubenville High School, were
raping an unconscious girl in the
next room. Two of the accused
have been arrested, but most of the
students implicated are not facing
charges, and Steubenville’s‘ assis-
tant coach Nate Hubbard told The
New York Times that the victim
made up the rape as an “excuse” for
a night of drunken bad behavior.

In the wake of these events,

-- --‘--- -onnpaounao

we should all be asking: Could
this happen at Pitt? And if it did,
would we know about it?

Bella Salamone, sexual assault

peer educator and president of

Campus Women’s Organization,
told demonstrators during the
Take Back The Night rally in Oc-
tober that 42 times a year, or about
once every week, someone at Pitt
says that he or she has been raped.
But Pitt’s annual crime report lists
only 12 incidents of rape in 2011.
That’s a wide discrepancy, but
not an unusual one. Colleges and
universities are required by law to
report sexual assault statistics, but
“data analysis by the Washington,
D.C.-based Center for Public In-
tegrity shows that there is a wide
discrepancy between the official
numbers universities report and
the numbers seen by campus and
community sexual assault counsel-
ing centers or other places victims
seek help,” according to an article
by Investigatewest.

Assaults reported to mental
health professionals only become
part of a school’s ofﬁcial records if
the victim decides to report them
to the campus police or judicial
board. In many cases, the desire to
keep reported numbers of sexual
assault low — after all, a hefty rape
ﬁgure can scare away prospective
students — leads schools to pres-

.-a-au:.nnpa4Aau»a can.

sure victims not to go to the police,
and to settle their cases “in—house”
through a student conduct hearing.
That charge hasn’t been leveled at
Pitt, but thecases above should
give you an idea of how common
it is.

In less sinister cases, victims
don’t go to the police because it
simply doesn’t seem worth it. Al—
though reporting rape or sexual
assault is often framed as a matter
of “if you don’t report it, he might
do it again,” the fact is that only 10
percent of reported rapes —— and
most rapes aren’t reported —- re-
sult in the assailant spending at
least one day in prison. For those
who are convicted and incarcer-
ated, the average amount of time
spent in jail is a little more than
ﬁve years, a sentence comparable
to a drug offense. With all that in
mind, I don’t blame victims for not
reporting assaults. ’

When we do talk about rape on
college campuses, we mostly talk
about it as a reason why women
shouldn’t party. During my fresh-
man orientation in 2009, we
watched a series of skits about the
hazards of college life, and one de-

‘ picted a woman telling a friend that

she was assaulted, but there was no
mention of campus judicial pro-

cesses, Sexual Assault Services or Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape and no information on
how to ﬁle a police complaint, request a rape
kit or even access emergency contraception.

A “Failing as it did to teach students what to do

if they or a friend were victimized, the skit
only functioned as an ominous warning.

‘‘Don’t let this happen to you.”

Victim—focused prevention initiatives are

often billed as the “realistic” approach, an

alternative to being all kumbaya and telling
women that preventing rape isn’t their re-

sponsibility —- the latter supposedly leading ,

women to take chances. But overwhelmingly,

these approaches don’t help. Because their-

message to students is “don’t get raped,”
the message to those who do get raped is
“you screwed up” —_ whether or not that is
the intention. -* 1

When we do talk to‘ men about rape and
consent 4- and to our credit, we do; Sexual
Assault Services’ education programs are
mandatory for fraternities and sororities,
though perhaps those programs should be
expanded to more of the student body — we
often make the mistake of directing those
efforts at preventing the mythical, would-
be “accidental rapist.” Despite the popular
idea that perpetrator—targeted anti-rape
efforts mostly work to enlighten men who
just didn’t know that a woman who is passed-
out drunk can’t give her consent to have sex,

studies in criminal behavior suggest that 7

most men instinctively know that -— and the
ones who are raping passed—out girls anyway
have very much the same thought process
as the attackers who jump out of the bushes.

False accusations of rape are actually
very rare. Rapists single out drunk girls spe-
ciﬁcallyzbecause they’re easy to discredit.
Someonegsaying,“I didn’t hear her say no,” is
probablfnot telling you the truth. Teaching
studentsthese real facts about rape would
go a long way toward preventing the sort of
victim—blaming ﬁasco that we saw at Notre
Dame.

But our resources are limited. We have
only one full—time sexual assault response
and education coordinator, Sexual Assault
Servicesfrlirector Mary Koch Ruiz, who su-
pewisesffieer educators, provides individual
and group therapy to sexual assault survi-
vors, and responds to emergencies called in

to the Pitt police. There is only one therapy ' 4
group for. survivors of sexual assault at Pitt, -

and it is off-limits tolmen. As much as Pitt
cares about keeping students safe, much
of how we approach rape prevention here
is incomplete or inconsistent with what we
know about sexual assault. - ;
The ﬁrst step is admitting you have a
problem. Universities all across America
have a major rape problem, and Pitt — like
every major university that’s been fortunate
enough not to have a major rape scandal
yet — needs to seriously evaluate how we
approach sexual assault on campus so we
don’t end up in the headlines next. I

  LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

In response to Joshua Phillips’ letter to the editor onJanuary 11th, it appears that Mr. Phillips neglects one of the central points of Daniel Okwaisie’s column onJan. 8 (“Science
and religion can, should coexist”). As Okwaisie mentioned, scientiﬁc study and religious beliefs can be used to reinforce each other. From the perspective of someone who has faith
in a particular religion, pursuing scientiﬁc knowledge can often reaﬂirm one’s faith in a God who created such a complex and intricate world that it could not be any other way. For
example, many notable academic achievements were accomplished by followers of the Islamic faith, including discoveries and advancements in architecture, astronomy, medicine
and mathematics. Hence, it was possible for these people of faith to reach extraordinary academic milestones without compromising their religious beliefs. Thus, when it comes to
ﬁnding a balance between academic pursuits and faith in God, a choice does not have to be made to swing to only one side of the spectrum. Rather, it is possible to reach a middle
point where both intellectual reasoning and religious beliefs can coincide.

Toxic online images discourage healthytbehavior, exercise

Rebecca Burns
S taff I1/rz'z‘er

As a hopeful crafter, profes-
sional organizer and shopping
extraordinaire, many of my
unproductive moments are oc-
cupied by Pinterest. With the
commencement ofthe new year
— and the fact that we are unbe-
lievably halfway through January
—-— many of us have made plans
to work toward a healthier 2613.
And for my pinning friends, this
means an overwhelming myriad
of fitness pins.

Most of these pins consist
of girls with perfectly sculpted
physiques running up stairs,
scaling down enormous cliffs,
or biking through the wilderness
with a passionate look in their
eyes — a look that says, “I am a
beast who scales mountains in
the morning and rocks my little
black dress at night.” I

to make us feel like we can be
a morning beast and a night
beauty without sacrificing one
for the other. They read: “Use
it or lose it,” “You are what you
eat” and “ second on the lips,
forever on the hips.”

Although cliche, every time
I read one with a superwoman
image in the background, I get
sucked‘ in to the phrases and
fabulous abs. But a mere five
minutes later, I find that piece
ofﬂab that seems like a million

, crunches and endless treadmill

miles will never overcome, and
as I despair, I give in to the sweet
chocolate morsels hidden in the

top pantry shelf.

I amiconvinced that these
images and words of wisdom,

’ although meant to inspire, are

toxic for many girls, especially
thosewith body-image issues.
And for anyone who wants
to raise her hand and say she

from the musical for the 25th anniversary
in 2010. “He’s the one who said, ‘Let’s make
it different.’ He was really the inspiration
to not hold on to the past and keep things
different,” O’Donnell said.

O’Donnell explained that a conventional
Jean Valjean is a “big, brutish man with a
large Voice.” The original version of the new-

S est production featured the ﬁrst African-* S
American Jean Valjean, “a wildly different
interpretation of the role,” O’Donnell said.

Now, a much scrappier version of the
character appears on stage, something that
O’Donnell believes keeps the show fresh. For
many directors, their initial instinct is to
ﬁnd someone who is similar to the original
character both in stature and in voice. ‘

“Ultimately, it’s making a copy of a copy,” _
O’Donnell said. - ‘ . 7 it

cal to represent the tumultuous thematic

content, and many fans have come to know

the musical with this aesthetic aspect.

Mackintosh installed a series of images
to accompany the performance in place of
the iconic turntable.

“We do not use the turntables from the
production 25 years ago,” O’Donnell said.
In addition to his writing, Hugo was
an esteemed painter who produced many
portraits that relate directly to the content
of his novel. Although these paintings are
fairly well—known, they just recently adopted
another function as a projection backdrop

for the musical.

“Victor Hugo drew the paintings. It also
adds another layer, another artistry that
wasn’t there before,” Ilaw said.

“There have been put in place these fan-
tastic projections — exact replicas of Victor
Hugo’s paintings. He was a good artist. Some
of his paintings were used as backdrops in
our productions. They added movement to
them to add some energy,” O’Donnell said.

The projections may stray from the origi-
nal performance sequence that many musi-
cal fans have come to appreciate, but they
provide “Les Misérables” with fresh material
after two and a half decades.

“Everything on the stage spun, and that’s
how everyone knows the original production

of ‘Les Mis.’ Because we so expect the turn-
table — miss it or not miss it -— it makes us
look at the stage with new eyes,” Ilaw said.

The projections add a new dimension
to the musical that could not have been
achieved in the past because the technol-
ogy that creates them wasn’t available during
early productions. Although the turntable
performance might always remain classic,
this version gives a new spin to thetimeless
production. "

“The projections add so much. It’s some-
thing that you couldn’t have achieved in 1985
in the original production. It creates literally
forward movement,” Ilaw said. “It could be

age, you can stop reading now.

A Perhaps these images encourage you to
work out and eat better. Then they work
for you. But for those of us who look at

these pictures and end up discouraged ’

with our own bodies, surrendering shame-
fully to the cookie jar, I have one more
dictum for you this year that I think ev-

eryone — body issues or not — can gain

from. It is Descartes’ statement, “I think,
therefore I am.” -

I have found that many people who
develop poor health habits often struggle
with the idea that they and their health
are too far gone to regain a healthier life-
style. Or others feel that they just aren’t
the exercising type.

Instead of basing their appearance off
reality and health, they compare them-

_ selves to these perfect pin images, and it

becomes immediately discouraging be-

cause it seems out of reach. Those who '

believe these things about themselves are
going to have a really difficult time find-
ing the motivatidn to change their habits.
Such negativity breeds poor thinking,

and will only discourage healthy habits.

You must set a solid foundation at the
beginning of any _exercise regimen or
change in eating. This foundation includes
an openness to change and the belief that
this change will happen by initially ac-
cepting where your body is now." You then
must choose a path that takes care of your
body while working to change it.

Exercising and eating right are essen-
tial to living a healthy life. Many of you

' know how to eat healthy andiyou know

how to walk, how to run and even how
to ride a bike. At Pitt, we have access to
nutritionists, fitness experts and gyms.
There are numerous resources available

that can get you involved in club sports, -

recreational activities and opportuni-
ties to learn how to eat healthily. Calling
Pitt’s Student Health Service for informa-

tion about meeting with a nutritionist or

checking out www.intramurals.pitt.edu
for a schedule of Healthy U ﬁtness classes
are two good placesto start. Though I
could write explicit facts about how to
eat right and how to exercise, if you don’t
have the willingness to change your life-
style and the motivation to do so, it will
never happen.

_ Don’t focus on the perfect bodies of
others, especially those transmitted
through Pinterest. Instead, focus on
where your body is now and the goals
you set for yourself. Find encouragement
in friends, family, nutritionists or fitness
experts. Knowthat you are thetone in

__ control. ofyour body and ifyou choose to

lnake this the year when you become the

beast you see in other women, then you ‘

can live with the same reckless abandon,
My encouragement for all of the people

who have made health resolutions for

2013 is to add another resolution to th

list: avoid comparison.I T V l

The dichotomy results in an epic love

Beneﬁting from 125—pound forfeit,

Pit lost a tight contest to a conference ooe by a mer pit, even after spotting the opposition

six over the weekend. Claire Deahl | Staff Photographer

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt wrestling head coach Rande

K Stottlemyer captured his 300th
"career win, and his team won

two of its three matches at the
Pitt Duals.

But Sunday’s competition at
the Fitzgerald Field House was
still a disappointment.

~14? The Pitt Duals started off

with the biggest match of the
day for the No. 12 Pitt squad as
it faced off with No. 24 Blooms~
burg, an EWL foe.

Pitt has gotten behind early

1.? in matches all season, and this

one was no different. It trailed
19-3 going into the ﬁnal four
matches, and this time its upper
weight classes couldn’t carry the
team, as Pitt fell 19-18.

The Panthers have un-

/“ derachieved all year at the

125—pound weight class, but Sun-
day, that lack of success reached
a new low: They had to forfeit
that weight class —— the lowest

one —— in each match.

“125 has been a struggle for
[us] all season,” redshirt sopho-
more Max Thomusseit said. “To-
day, we had one guy not make
weight and another couldn’t
wrestle due to grades.”

Forfeits count as six team
points against the guilty party,
so each opponent had a good
head start before the ﬁrst whis-
tle even blew. A

Pitt came out on the wrong
end of two of the biggest early
matches against the Huskies.

No. 15 Shelton Mack lost to
No. 18 Nick Wilcox of Blooms-
burg 5-4 in the second sudden
victory period, and No. 14 Ty-
ler Wilps lost 5-2 to No. 16 josh
Veltre.

Even the higher weight class-
es didn’t have their usual suc-
cess. No. 2 Matt Wilps struggled
with his unranked wrestler from
Bloomsburg before picking up a
6-5 overtime win.

“I feel good. My ﬁrst match
was much closer than I would
like, but I was able to pull it out

 No. 24 Bloomsburg upends I’itt

in the end,” Matt Wilps said.

Pitt could’ve used some bonus
points from its top wrestler, and
looking back, it would have only
taken one to force a tie after Zac
Thomusseit recorded a pin in the
heavyweight match. ,

The No. 8 wrestler took down
No. 18 Justin Grant in the first
period with a pin at 1:54.

“[Grant] was my only real
competition [in the Pitt Duals],
and he has had some solid wins
this year,” Thomusseit said. “I
wanted-to make my presence
known, because I will be seeing
him at the conference tourna-
ment.”

He recorded a pin against
each opponent that day and
was pleased with his own per-
formance. However, the senior
leader was upset with the loss
and knows the team needs to
adjust if it wants to win a con-
ference title. '

2012-2013 football
season in review

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Writer

In August, numerous fans surely
made predictions about how the
2012 Pitt football team would
fare during its season. I thought
the Panthers would go 7-5 and
have a shot at the conference
championship with a 4-3 record
against Big East teams. But as the
season progressed, nearly every
Pitt fan learned/once again that
attempts tcgpredict the Panthers’
gperform  "are quite fruitless

 

7' 7 endeavorsfgis it seemed that a dif-
ferent team stepped on the ﬁeld

every week.

For example, there was
the team that racked up more
than 600 yards of total offense
against Gardner-Webb, yet could
only score 17 points against the
Youngstown State Penguins; the
team that never had a chance
against conference doormat
Connecticut, yet took national
championship participant.No. 4
Notre Dame to three overtimes.

Without further ado, here’s a
reﬂection on the 2012 Pitt Pan-
thers with a look at prior predic-
tions for Pitt’s “Big East Farewell
Tour,” as well. "

Sept. 1: vs. Youngstown State

Prediction: Pitt 34-YSU 10

Actual: YSU 31-Pitt 17

Despite high hopes for the ﬁrst
season under new head coach
Paul Chryst, the Panthers opened
the season ﬂat. The defense was
unable to stop the Penguins’ all
game long, and the offense gen-
erated little excitement. As a re-
sult, Pitt never held a lead. YSU’s
spread offense kept the Panthers
offense off the ﬁeld, converting 11
of 16 third-down opportunities.

Sept. 6: at Cincinnati

Prediction: Pitt 24-Cincinnati
14

Actual: Cincinnati 34-Pitt 10

Coming off a short week in
which YSU dominated all facets of
the game, not many expected Pitt
to come out on top in its ﬁnal ﬁrst
game in the Big East, as well as
the last “River City Rivalry,” crazy
trophyand all, for the foresee-
able future. On that Thursday eve-

ning, the unbelievers were right
about the Panthers — Cincinnati
jumped out to a 17-0 lead, scoring
two touchdowns in the ﬁrst ﬁve
minutes of the game.

The Bearcats led by as much as
31 late in the game, before Tino
Sunseri threw a touchdown pass
to Drew Carswell in garbage time.

Sept. 15: vs. Virginia Tech

Prediction: VT 30-Pitt 10

Actual: Pitt 35—VT 17

The Panthers gave no one any
reason to believe they would win
a game against a then—ranked
opponent that had what every-
one believed to be one of the
nation’s most talented passing
games. However, Pitt came out
and played lights out against Vir-
ginia Tech. Ray Graham scored
three touchdowns — two on the
ground, one in the air — and the
defense intercepted VT quarter-
back Logan Thomas three times.

But why will this game be re-
membered? It was the breakout of
Rushel Shell. The true freshman
compiled 157 yards on the ground
over the course of 23 carries.

Sept. 22: vs. Gardner-Webb

Prediction: Pitt 35-Gardner-
Webb 10 _

Actual: Pitt 55-Gardner-Webb
10

Pitt’s matchup against the
Runnin’ Bulldogs had the out-
come I expected for the YSU
game: a rout. The Panthers put
up more than 600 yards of total
offense — 626, to be exact, in
contrast to 127 yards gained by
Gardner-Webb.

Shell rushed for his ﬁrst col-
legiate touchdown, Mike Shana-
han caught a 77-yard touchdown
pass, Sunseri threw for 344 yards
and the defense prevented the
Runnin’ Bulldogs from scoring a
touchdown on offense.

Oct. 5: at Syracuse

Prediction: Pitt 31-Syracuse 17

Actual: Syracuse 14-Pitt 13

After playing a solid game in
the ﬁrst three quarters, Sunseri
morphed into the Tino of old that
Pitt fans had seen for the two
seasons prior to 2012, when he

GRAIN OF SAUL

Bonds deserves
   of Fame
entry based
on play

Isaac Saul
Senior Stcyff‘ Wrz'ter

For the second time in the last two decades-
and the eighth time ever, no players were
elected into Major League Baseball’s Hall
of Fame last week. Unfortunately, the re-
jection of Barry Bonds was a mistake that
might tarnish Hall of Fame voting’s cred-
ibility as much as Bonds tarnished the cred-
ibility of power hitters.

Like several of the other worthy candi-
dates who were denied access to the hall
(i.e. Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ra-
fael Palmeiro), it seems pretty clear Bonds
used steroids.

‘I, like most reasonably logical Ameri- V I

cans, do not think that Bonds is innocent.
However, that is not to say that I believe

’ he shouldn’t have been elected to the Hall

of Fame.

Of course, if anyone should know that,
it’s you — a reader here in Pittsburgh. In
case you missed it, Bonds actually earned

‘ himself a spot in Cooperstown long before

he started using steroids. Back when he was
a star in this city for the Pirates, Bonds was
a two-time MVP and, without question, the
best player‘ in the game.

He stole 32 bases or more in a season six
times, led the league in on-base percent-
age and walks and finished with 30 home
runs and 30 stolen basestwice early in
his career. '

When he went to San Francisco, he won
the MVP award for a third time and became
only the second player ever to hit 40 home
runs and steal 40 bases. The only player
before him‘?Jose Canseco.

So, when did it all go wrong? It seems it
was in 1998, when Bonds quietly became
the ﬁrst player in MLB,history to hit 400
home runs and steal 400 bases. Unfortu-
nately for his front-page fame, there was a
bit of a home—run~battle going on between
McGwire and Sosa — two steroid—using,
corked-batted cheaters. ~

And then, like many of us would have
done, Bonds decided it wasn’t worth play-
ing the game honestly when nobody else
was. Hestarted juicing, and his numbers
took the appropriate boost.

The next year, Bonds hit a career high
49 home runs. A year later, he shattered the
single-season home run record and led the
league in on-base percentage. By the time
it was all said and done, he was the all—time
home runs and walks leader, stole over 500

in the lead. .

Pitt played against Syracuse very Well 

for the most part, locking down the Or-
ange’s passing game and keeping them at
bay all game long after Syracuse scored on
its ﬁrst drive. After, the only other score
for ’Cuse came on a Pitt turnover when
Dyshawn Davis took a Graham fumble 52
yards to the house.

Oct. 13: vs. No. 13 Louisville

Prediction: Louisville 27-Pitt 13

Actual: Louisville 45—Pitt 35

This game was closer than it seems’-
Pitt actually led that afternoon, taking a
21-17 advantage into the second half. But
the Cardinals burst out of the gates in the
second, scoring three third-quarter touch-
downsfto carry a 38-21 advantage into the
ﬁnal frame. Pitt scored twice in the last
period but never threatened again after
Louisville’s run.

Oct. 20: at Buffalo

Prediction: Pitt 31-Buffalo 10

Actual-: Pitt 20—Buffalo 6

On a Saturday on which most Pitt stu-
dents were out making a difference for
PMADD, the football team was in Buffalo
playing in the freezing-cold rain and wind.
In arguably the most aesthetically ugly
game everplayed, Pitt slogged through
the mud to get a rebound victory after two
consecutive losses. ‘

Certainly, Pitt and its fans should be
happy there is no foreseeable return to
Buffalo. Even Pitt’s student radio organiza-
tion, WPTS, had trouble during the game,

- L‘ ’1ﬁ*aiibther off'e7hs*ive explosion at Heinz

Field, the Panthers scored 47 points, with
Graham scoring three touchdowns on his
own — more points than the Owls amassed
altogether. Sunseri accounted for the other
three scores, completing touchdown passes
to Devin Street, Shanahan, andj.P. Holtz.

‘The only damper on the day was Harper’s

missed extra point in the fourth quarter.

Nov. 3: at No. 4 Notre Dame ,

Prediction: Notre Dame 20—Pitt 14

Actual: Notre Dame 29-Pitt 26 (3OT)

 (sigh) 

Nov. 9: at Connecticut

Prediction: Pitt 20-UConn 14

-Actual: UConn 24—Pitt 17

Although Pitt lost by only seven points,
the Panthers never really had a chance to
win this one: UConn led 24-0 at halftime,
after which the Panthers decided to put
forth some sort of effort. They scored 17
points to make the game look respectable.

But really, UConn did just about whatev-
er it wanted, scoring on a touchdown run,
pass and punt return. Pitt never seemed to
get it together in the ﬁrst half, and the game
was basically over at the midway point.

Nov. 24: vs. Rutgers

Prediction: Rutgers 24-Pitt 17

Rutgers would look to vie for the Big East
championship with Louisville. But then

Prediction: USF 31-Pitt 14

Actual: Pitt 27-USF 3

 Prior to the season, USF seemed to be
the only team with a shot at knocking off
the Louisville Cardinals for the Big East
championship. And then the Bulls started
to playvfootball. During the game, Graham
topped 1,000 yards for the season for the
ﬁrst time in his career and scored two
touchdowns for Pitt. Most importantly,
the win gave Pitt a 6-6 record and ensured
a trip to Birmingham, Ala., for the third‘
season in a row. to play in the illustrious
BBVA Compass Bowl. ’

Jan. 5: vs. Mississippi

Prediction: N/A

‘ Actual: Ole Miss 38-Pitt 17

Pitt returned to Birmingham, likelyr
under the banner that the Panthers were
going to “Take Back What is Ours” after
losing to Southern Methodist in the bowl
last year. Sadly for me —— and maybe two or
three other people — Pitt proved unable to
take it back. Now, there will be no second
BBVA Compass Bowl Trophy to join the
one the Panthers earned in 2010, which
is tucked away at the South Side facility
where you won’t see it until you leave the
building.

It’s like you walk in and don’t even think
about it. And then you leave and you see‘
it, and you think to yourself, “Oh yeah,
that happened. Where am I going for lunch
today?” I
