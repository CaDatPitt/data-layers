University’s Base Hospital
Leaves For Army Training

Pitt’s army hospital corps completed mobilization Wed-
nesday and left for war medicine training in an army camp.

Second hospital corps in
unit included 48 doctors, seven den-
tists, two chaplains, 120 nurses,
and ﬁve commissioned and ﬁve non-
commissioned medical men. It was
fully equipped to establish a 1,000-
bed general hospital.

This hospital is being establish-
ed at a secret station, where the
unit will receive from six weeks
to three months’ war medical train-
ing.

The function of the hospital, as
outlined by the office of the Sur-
geon-General, will depend upon the
military situation, the number, and
the distribution of military units.

General Hospital 27 is a reor-
ganization of Base Hospital 27,
which was founded during the
last war. The mobilization of the
unit was ordered by the Surgeon
Gener_al’s oﬂice more than a year
ago.

Most of the personnel are alumni
of Pitt or have been associated with
the School of Medicine or the Medi-
cal center. Lieutenant-Colonel Har-

After basic training, the unit
will be shipped to some battle

In the last war, Base Hospital 27
was organized on the campus in
1917. It sailed on the Red Star liner
Lapland in September, and was set
up in a former boys’ school in
Angers, France. By November, it
was ready for its ﬁrst patients, 20
American soldiers.

By January, 1919, after 15
months in France, the unit had
cared for if total of 19,582 men as
well as many patients from nearby

camps. Its capacity had been in-
creased from 500 to 5,000 beds.

for the summer session, due to the small enrollment, and in
an effort to curb large unnecessary expenses. They won their

point from the Men’s Fraternity committee. Early this week, -

News Staff
Set,5chedu|e
is Revised

A new publication schedule for
the Pitt News, together with an-
nouncement of new staff positions,
was made today‘ by editor, Irwin
Rosen, C43.

Instead of coming out twice a
week, and publishing only up until
August 25, the news will come out
weekly, and will continue publica-
tion on through September 2, up
until one week before ﬁnal exams
of the summer semester.

Reason given for the change was
a lack of student activities on cam-
pus during the summer, coupled
with attempts to save money.

Rosen announced as his staﬁ
heads, Charles Camarata, C43,
managing editor; William Ollis,
C43, and Alex Zelenski, C43, as-
sociate editors; Paul Pﬁschner,
C44, campus edtor; and George
Chirigos, C44, copy editor.

New managing editor Camarata
is an English major, transfer from
Bethany college, former Delta Tau
Delta member. Associate editor
Ollis is an English major, has work-
ed on local newspapers since his
high school days. Zelenski, a mem-
ber of Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity,
is chairman of the powerful SFA
appointments committee, has been
sports editor of the News for the
past year.

Pﬁschner is a member of the Pitt
band, men’s council, is an English
major. Chirigos is a Druid, mem-
ber of Pitt Town meeting commit-
tee, is a pre-law student.

New publication dates for the
news, which will appear on campus
each Tuesday, are: July 14, 21,
28, August 4, 11, 18, 25, Septem-
ber 1.

Part-Time Employment
Registration . Conducted

Men students who desire part-
time employment while attending
school this summer should register
with Robert Hamilton, C43, who is
in charge of the undergraduate di-
vision of the placement bureau, 804
Cathedral. The office is open during
the afternoons. ‘

however, campus fraternity leadp
ers were scratching their heads
wondering whether they were right

in changing for only 10 boys have-

thus far accepted fraternity bids.
More boys are expected to
pledge within the next few weeks,
but if not, the Pitt fraternity
houses are in for the lowest rush-
ing season in the history of the
school.
Eight houses submitted 87 bids
for boys this summer, in decided

contrast to the previous year's to- I
'tal'of 200 or more bids.

Delta Tau Delta, perennial cam-
pus rushing leader, once again
leads the way in the early stage!
of the race with four new pledges.
Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Delta
Theta have two men pledged while
Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi Lambda Phi
each have one new man.

The following boys have ac-
cepted bids: Delta Tau Delta—-
Tluomas Carr, _ Harry Bloomer,
Lester Botkin, James Haymalggi.
Phi Delta Theta——Paul Aller,
Forest Biiterbaugh. Phi Gamma.
Delta——Donald Hilliker, Hugh
Clemmer. Phi Epsilon Pi-—-P',34r-
bert Blumenfelzl. Pi Lambda Ehi
-Coleman Meyers.

The total is by no means com-
plete. for boys are being called up
to the dean of men’s office each
day to accept or reject their bids.

Penn State Coach
Offers Summer
Phys Ed Course

Prominent ﬁgures in the sports

world are common in Johnny Law- .

ther’s physical education class that
is now being taught every day in

the University of Pittsburgh sum-‘ ‘ ‘

mer session.

Mr. Lawther, himself, is by no
-means an unknown for he is re-
garded as being one of the coun-
try's top notch basketball coaches.
Lawther, formerly coach of the
Westminster Titans, and now
coach of the Penn State team has
compiled the amazing record of
250 victories during his 15 year:
of coaching against only 70 set»-
backs:

Over 30 are present in Lawther's
classes some of whom include A!
Ferrera, former Panther track star,
the head of the physical education
department at the University of
Alabama, and many district high
school mentors.

Trueblood, Burmese Professor, Recalls
Flight From Jap lnvaded Country

Japanese invasion of Burma gave
Pitt the services of Lester True-
blood, former head of the geog-
raphy department at Judson Col-
lege, University of Rangoon in
Burma. He is replacing Dr. Stotz,
assistant professor of geography,
for the summer while Dr. Stotz is
on a leave of absence.

Professor Trueblood was under
contract to teach in Rangoon for a
period of four years. Actually, he
remained in Burma for an addition-
al six months, perilously close to
the time of the Japanese invasion.

Although his route forced him

to pass through Japan from Bur-
ma, Professor Trueblood did not
linger on his way out.

When the Japanese started their
invasion, the University of Ran-
goon was abandoned and has now
probably been razed to the ground.
The faculty and student body evac-
uated the area as best they could,
Professor Trueblood said.

Several members of the faculty
went into China, others from
whom he has heard are now in
India. One of the professors in the
geography department was bomb-
ed in the first Japanese raid on

.-.._

Rangoon, and had both ankles and
one arm broken.

A letter from this professor writ-
ten in March while he was con-
valescing in the hills beyond Ran-
goon has just reached Professor
Trueblood. He hopes that the Brit-
ish were able to evacuate his col-
league.

Although Professor Trueblood
believes that the Japs will eventu-
ally be driven out of Burma, he
does not intend to return to the
tropics. He has had enough of the
heat, mosquitoes, and health pro-
cautions that had to be observed.

I know some things which, to me at least, help
blot out ugliness. Thoughts of Shubert’s “Ave
Maria ;” of my unselﬁsh older brother, my moth-
er, my devilish, yet thoughtful kid brother; of
my admiration for a friend, the ﬁnest and most
tragically wrong human I know; of MRS. MINIV-
ER’S honesty; of a child with long sandy locks,
as she smiled up at me, after a fall from her rol-
ler skates; of the warmness and power that
comes with having, through hard work, reached
a goal; of a ‘miracle every spring, when dead
things regain life; of Paul Robeson when he sings
“Ballad for Americans;” of thousands of noth-
ings that combine tomake everything, a life
worth living and fun living—these I will gladly
share. .

And, can’t you use that ability of yours to put
down on paper some thoughts that will inspire
others in these simpler ways ?' Don’t be selﬁsh.
Tell of the wonders of friendship, the wonders of
faith. I’m not asking you, Irwin, to toss aside your
crusadings.

But let’s face our enemies with more than just
a knowledge of their mistakes. Let’s show our
enemies the vlaue of a great song, a child’s smile,
a sincere act of friendship. Let’s dump bitterness,
forget smirks. Before we go about reforming

others, let’s explore ourselves. .
. BILL LEVIN, Bus. Ad has

Dear Bill:

You’re right. There is much beauty at the Uni- A

versity, in the world. But there is much dirt and
ﬁlth and ugliness too. And if we close our eyes to

etter . . .

 

life’s ugliness and write only of its beauty, the
ugliness lives, the ﬁlth remains. . ;
But if we write about the ﬁlth, and ﬁght long
enough and hard enough, maybe some day there
won’t be any more ugliness. That’s what we have
faith in. The people all over the world who,

through criticism, intense and vicious, have V

righted many of life’s wrongs.
We’ll never make any progress if we ignore the ‘ *

sordid and ugly—if we turn from it. The thing to
do is to tell about the ugliness and then have faith.
Have faith that people, just because they’re hu-
man beings, want better things—and, told of ugli-
ness, the people will ﬁght to replace it with
beauty. ‘
That’s where our faith lies.

You mention beauty. Of course Heinz chapel, the
Greek room, the Commons room are all beautiful.
But if you were Charles Rickmond, somehow the

band concert this year wouldn’t have sounded so, , 
beautiful. If you had seen the election cheating‘ -

last April, somehow the whole set of ideals at the
University would have lost much of its beauty.

In other words, there can be no beauty to any-ii  J

tihigg without beauty in the hearts of all men
rs . ’ E ’

_ So we’ll continue as we have done before, look- ‘i "
mg for beauty--but recognizing the ugly elements ,  I

in life that stand in the way of ﬁnding it, those‘

same things you mention——Jim Crow laws, religi-

ous bigotry, politicians, selﬁsh interests.
And by recognizing them, and telling people
about them and why they’re wrong and ugly—-,—
that’s how we’ll get to have beauty.

Shakespeare knew his stuff when
it came to swordplay, for the duel-

indicate a knowledge both of old
broadsword and buckler and the
newer rapier and dagger.

So says Horace S. Craig, asso-
ciate in French on the Los An-
geles campus of the University
of California who recently wrote
a pamphlet titled, “Dueling
Scenes and Terms in Shakes-
peare’s Plays.” Craig was cap-

Pitt Graduate

To Superintencl
New Hospital

Pitt graduate Dr. G. B. Pearson
recently appointed as superintend-
ent for the Western Psychiatric
hospital, located on the Pitt cam-
pus, has announced that it.is sched-
uled to open before September 1.

Dr. Pearson obtained his bachel-
or of science and doctor of medi-
cine degrees at the University, and
then went on to serve his intern-
ship in the Presbyterian Hospital.

‘The hope of Pennsylvania psy-

chiatrists for a fully-equipped in-
stitution began to come true with
the donation of land by the Uni-
versity.

Although the hospital will be

opened before September 1. pa-
tients will not be admitted until
several months later. In the inter-
val, Dr. Pearson will haveto or-
ganizea staff and obtain the ﬁnal
equipment that is needed.

Costing more than two and a
half "million dollars, the building.
which was started in 1938-. and
completed in 1940, has remained
vacant for two years because of
the lack of state funds. A

Although the building’-_ is eighteen
stories high, it only contains ac-
commodations for two hundred per-
sons, but this is because the hos-
pital’s chief purpose is research. "

Such.intensive"research as is in-
tended to be carried on here is not

possible in thevery active general
mental hospitals. At this hospital,

, psychiatrists will be able tovproper-T

ly study the mentally ill.

College Faculty
First Woman ln 1918,

   

job. But Blossom Henry, assistant professor of modern lan-

guages, has that record to her credit.

The shy instructor who speaks
French as ﬂuently as English, will
never forget her ﬁrst few weeks at
Pitt. Her very ﬁrst impression was
that the University was “full of
men.” She did not know until she
arrived here that she was to be the
only woman on the College faculty.

Particularly vivid in her mem-
ory is that first day when Chan-
cellor Samuel Black McCormick
told her at least ﬁve times that
the job was only temporary. He
made it very clear that the only
reason she got the job at all was
that they could not find a man to
ﬁll the position. (It was in Janu-
ary, 1918, and men were scarce.)

Miss Henry was in the graduate
school at Columbia when she was
oﬁered this teaching job. She had
never been to Pittsburgh before
and had no idea what Pitt would be
like. And she didn’t have time to
inquire. She received the word
about her new position on a Friday
night and on Sunday afternoon she

,was on her way.

"I liked Pitt right from the

start,” she claims, “but I did feel‘

strange especially in faculty meet-
ings when I was the only woman.”

Soon there were dinner invata-

.tions from the faculty members’
wives. It was a long time’ before
either . Chancellor McCormick or
John C. Fetterman then Dean of
the College would admit that the
quiet language teacher they had
— hiredin January was really doing
a ﬁne job. It was not until June,'in
' fact, that Miss Henry was asked to’
return in the fall. 7

She did return that next Sep-

‘ tember—and she will return

again next, September as she has
done for the past 23 years.

Pitt today reminds her some-
what of the Pitt she entered in
1.918. The boys were leaving then,
they are leaving now. Everyone
was talking about the war, now
they are talking about another war.
But at faculty meetings things are

1

not the same; there is more than

one person to give the feminine .

view on any problems that are dis-
cussed.

Miss Henry is still there, how-
ever, shy as ever. She has seen
many other women come and go
and is glad that she has remain-;9d,
even though “temporarily.”

Stresses Non-Acceleration In High School

By RUSSEL ROBINSON

Dr. Einar W. Jacobsen, dean of
the School ' of Education, in sum-
marizing education’s place in the
war effort said, “Educational insti-
tutions are adapting themselves to
the war and war time conditions

by accelerating their programs in
“such a way that students may fin-

ish their regular training in a

' shorter time.

This is taking place on the col-
lege and the university level, be-
cause it is on this level that the
special professional and technical
training is given”

Although he admits that a
pressing need for acceleration
exists in the educational systems,
Dean J acobsen is convinced that
education in the high schools and
elementary schools should not be-
accelerated.

Dean Jacobsen said, “The mat-
ter of the maturity of the individu-
al is involved. You can not rush ma-
turity and the country does not
want to rush it. Nothing at all is

"gained by sacriﬁcing youth for

war. England found that out and
is now trying to keep education on
a level as close to normal as pos-
sible.”

Dr. Jacobsen brought out the
point that the colleges and univer-
sities do not want students who
have not reached maturity. There
is nothing that higher institutions
can do for a person until he has
reached this point.

Although he is not in favor of
an all-out acceleration of high
school, Dr. Jacobsen pointed out
the fact that high school students
who are capable of it can accel-
erate to a certain point by means
of taking extra classes and by
going to summer school.

In relation to this subject he be-
lieves that high school students are
carrying their share of the load.
He said that the Board of Educa-
tion of this city alone has issued
thousands of working certiﬁcates to
high school students.

Dr. Jacobsen admitted that ac-
celeration in high schools was en-
tirely possible, but that “educators
and the parents in general do not
want it, because they recognize the
folly of letting education get
ahead of the maturity rate of the
individual.”

When discussing the effect of
drafting of educators on education
as a whole Dr. Jacobsen said that

PTM Hears Discussion

On Unions, Theirspurposes

Under the theme statement that the “welfare of any is
the concern of all,” John F. Lebus, regional director of the
National Labor Relations board, addressed a Pitt Town meet-

ing last Tuesday on the subject of
“Economic Security Through Col-
lective Bargaining.”

He said that through unionism,
workers seek security in their pres-
ent jobs and for the years to come-.
Besides this desire for security,
some of the fruits of unions are
uniform rates of wages, uniform
hours, priority rights ‘for workers,
arbitration of differences, a
usual continuity of employment,
and written trade agreements.

“Labor,” he said, “is not fight- -
ing over wages and hours at the
present as much as it is ﬁghting
for union organization and union
recognition.” In 1934, he said,
51.4 per cent of the strikes were
for this recognition and the oth-
er 48.6 per cent for other griev-
ances.

Lebus pointed out that unionism
was a natural development of our
economic system. In the past, em-
ployers, as a rule tried everything
in their power to combat this new
force. During the year 1936, em-
ployers were estimated to have

spent 80 million dollars in opposi- ’

tion to the union movement.

In connection with technological
improvements, he stated that labor

is not opposed to these improve- 4

ments even when they mean the
unemployment of men. What they
do desire is a position in the plan-
ning of these new improvements so
that they can be foreseen by the
laborers and the shock made easier
by the laborers’ switch to a new
ﬁeld or undertaking of new train-
ing.

In some systems, he said, a
closed shop is preferable. This
is usually the case in such indus-
tries as seasonal and marine or-
ganizations. Also a closed shop
is preferable where the employ-
er has a long history of labor dis-
putes and opposition to unionism.

On the other hand, .Lebus said
that he preferred the union shop.
That is the system where the em-
ployer may employ whomever he
pleases. But if the employee works
over a stipulated 30 or 60 days, he
must join the union in order to re-
main on the job as a regular em-
ployee.

Although he is not sure that
the incorporation of unions un-
der national guidance is the best
plan available, he thought that it
would be the inevitable outcome
in the future and that unions
ought to prepare for it.

On the whole, he stated that he
{was very optimistic about the labor

situation in the future. Labor may

become powerful enough to be a
strong factor in the government, he
said, but it wants to be a digniﬁed
sort of labor like the English party
and will probably be a good in-
fluence. _

On Tuesday at the regular Pitt
Town meeting in 324 Cathedral, Dr.
John Geise, associate professor of
history, will discuss the University
air raid set-up including in his talk
items of behind the scenes work as
well as our cooperation with other
organizations in case of an air raid.

education was suffering as a re-
sult of the draft, but it is certain
that education is not suffering any
more than any industry is.

He stated that education in rural
areas is experiencing trouble from
war-time conditions. Many teach-
ers are leaving their jobs to take
better-paying positions in war in-
dustries.

Pittsburgh educators are not
suffering nearly as much as are
the people of the rural districts.
Dr. Jacobsen said, “I believe that
the real solution to the problem
is to give educators, particularly
in rural districts, but in the cities
as well, a reasonable compensa-
tion.”

While discussing the position of
‘colleges and universities in war
time conditions, Dean Jacobsen said
that in a sense we are not really
accelerating. We are taking up the
slack. “There has been no con-
densing of the work. We are fol-
lowing the suggestions offered by
the army and navy. We are keep-
ing up our standards.”

It is too early to make any deﬁ-
nite plans for “after the war,” but
Dean Jacobsen is of the opinion
that a more ﬂexible plan should be
available for the college student.
Compulsory acceleration would
hardly be likely, but he believes
that the opportunity for accelera-
tion should be available to the stu-
dent.

[Quote . .

“Education for national unity
was achieved by the Nazis at the
cost of a general depreciation of
intelligence, lowering of scholas-
tic standards, and corruption of
national morality. Absolute indoc-
trination was achieved by gro-
tesque falsifications of history and

by inculcating certain emotions be- '

fore the critical faculties had a

chance to develop. The Nazis prov-
ed masters not only in the psy-
chology of education but in its
organization, as they did in all
other ﬁelds. They organized new
educational agencies and institu-
tions which took educational lead-
ership away from the schools. I
am referring to labor camps, so-
called land years and, above all,
the youth organization of the par-
ty. The result has been a reversal
of educational values: of greatest
importance now are physical fit-
ness, indoctrination, the develop-
ment of the ‘will,’ silent obedi-
ence and absolute loyalty; of
least importance is intellectual de-
velopment.”—-Dr. Frederick Lilge,

Dr. Yoakam Extends Theoryi
On Reading In Education

Learning to read properly is a
basic factor in adjusting the child
to school and to his environment in
general. A surprising number of
children have visual difficulties, ac-
cording to Dr. G. A. Yoakam, di.
rector of courses in elementary
education.

“From 10 to 20 per cent of the
children in public schools have de-
fects in reading,” Dr. Yoakam stat-
ed, but added that many school dis-
tricts have corrective classes for
backward children.

The new tendency in modern
education, according to Dr. Yoak-
am, is the development of a pro-
gram for the prevention of read-
ing difficulties. He points out as
causes of troubles in reading:
poor training in reading, poor
_yision, speech diﬂiculties, defec-
tive hearing, and lack of opportu-
nity and practice in reading.

As director of the Remedial
Reading laboratory at the Univer-
sity, Dr. Yoakam explains, “It has
been our experience in the lab-
oratory that most of the cases we
meet, aside from those inferior in
intelligence, have become disabled
in reading because of preventative
factors.

“Remedial work is commonly
necessary in the building of ind-
dependent recognition skills,
some of which have been neglect-
ed in a child's regular training.
Probably the large size of class-
es in primary school as well as
the inexperience of some teach-
ers is as much a cause of reading
disability as any other factor.”

Pitt’s remedial reading labora-
tory is one of the most complete
laboratories of this kind in the
United States.

“That all children who are able
should learn to read is an educa-
tional truism, for reading unlocks
the past, enlightens the present,
and stirs the imagination to peer
into the future.”
