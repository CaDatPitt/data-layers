UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Voting registration
set up by Democrats

By Brendan Kevenides

‘. Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
College Democrats began their
campaign yesterday in the Litch-
field Towers to register the cam-
pus community to vote in the
upcoming November election.

This is the College Democrats’
first voter registration drive this
year, and they will hold more
such drives in the Towers lobby
and in the William Pitt Union

C from now until Nov. 4.

Despite signs hailing the
Dukakis/Bentsen presidential
ticket as their election choice, the
Democrats are registering all peo-
ple to vote, regardless of their
party ‘preference, and are not try-
ing to verbally persuade persons
to vote Democratic, according to
_Elizabeth Folley-Saxon, a Pitt
coordinator for the Dukakis
campaign.

”We have registered Republi-
cans,” said Folley—Saxon. But she
added that they have registered
many more Democrats.

Pitt's College Democrats are
working with Victory '88, a na-

‘tional campaign group working

for the election of Michael
Dukakis, and with Dukakis’ Pitts-

burgh headquarters at Chatham_

Center downtown.

Folley-Saxon explained that
when people walk up to the ta-
ble, she asks them if they are
registered to vote. She said that
many of the people who come to

the tablevare already registered
but would like information about
acquiring -an absentee ballot,
which is required to vote out of
your home state. These persons
are simply told to re—register so
they can vote in Oakland, said
Folley-Saxon.

According to ‘ Folley-Saxon,
while people are registering,
many of them have questions
about Dukakis’ stance on a wide
variety of issues. In response, she,
or one of her colleagues will
hand them an "issue paper” out-
lining Dukakis’ particular stance.

National defense seems to be
the single issue most on people's
minds at Pitt.

"I think defense is becoming
the big issue,” said Ken Haber, a
Pitt coordinator for the Dukakis
campaign.

Haber added that many people
are interested in’Dukakis' stance
on apartheid.

After registering, said Folley-
Saxon, people are asked if they
are democrats, and if so, if they
would like to volunteer their help
to the Democratic campaign.

"I believe in Dukakis’ poli-
cies,” said Pitt sophomore Lisa
Lenard as she agreed to volunteer
her time to the Dukakis run for
the White House.

Lenard said that although she
is already registered to vote in the
state of Pennsylvania, she likes
the Democratic stance on poli-
cies such as education and would
like to help out.

‘Pitt and CMU to explore

transit rail possibilities

By Michelle L. O'Brien
and Adam W. Richter

For The Pitt News

Imagine traveling from the
Cathedral of Learning to the Car-
negie Mellon campus in under
30 seconds. It won't always be
impossible.

Officials at the University of
Pittsburgh and CMU are develop-
ingthe technology to build a
magnetic levitation passenger
train system to alleviate traffic
congestion in the Oakland area.

The rail cars would run slight-
ly above the track on a field of

‘magnetic energy and be powered

by an electric current generated
at stations along the system route.

According to George White,
Pitt's vice president for research,
civil engineers at Pitt are working
with engineers at CMU’s High
Speed Ground Transportation
Center to research the possibility

of building a two-mile magnetic
levitation rail system connecting
Pitt's School of Medicine, the
CMU campus and the joint
biotechnology—robotics center
currently under construction near
the Monongahela River.

White said the university has a
"fundamental concern for any-
thing that improves mass transit
in the Oakland area.”

According to White, the "ideal
would be a line along Second
Avenue to Biotech Center, then
looped to the Medical School at
Scaife Hall, then to CMU.”

Richard Uher, director of the
High Speed Ground Transporta-
tion Center, said the project will
create jobs, improve transporta-
tion in the area and lead to more
community development.

According to White, the densi-
ty of the population in Oakland
prohibits ”the usual American so-
lution of bringing out the cement

Student leaders and officials convene

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

The Student Affairs Advisory
Committee convened yesterday
for their first session this fall.
Comprised of several student
leaders and senior Pitt officials,
the committee meets once a
month during the school year to
discuss important events on
campus.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar,
who chairs the committee, said,
"The committee was set up by
me years ago when we had differ-
ent problems on campus and
were under substantial public
pressure. When dealing with
25,000 to 26,000 students and all
of our different schools, it's vital
to have open channels of com-
munication to reflect the stu-
dents’ interests.”

Posvar said that there was no
objective reason why the student
groups present on the committee
were there except that they
represented a large number of Pitt
students. "It's not perfect, a lot of
people were left out," said
Posvar.

The lnterfraternity Council up-
date was first on the agenda. IFC
President Chuck Farinella, speak-
ing on the subject of community

relations, said, "ln light of com-
plaints from North Oakland
citizens, it was necessary to com-
municate with residents, the city
police and state police to find out
if any fraternity houses were be-
ing a bother. An agreement was
made in regard to feedback.”

Farinella said that a followup
on complaints by the North
Bellefield Citizens Association
showed that 30 to 40 percent of
the complaints were not related
to fraternities. "I've received
complaints from Pat Scanlon
regarding incidents near Bouqet
Street, and we have no recog-
nized fraternities in that area,”
said Farinella.

Vice President of Student Af-
fairs Konney Kimbo said, "It ap-
pears that you're taking a
pro—active approach to the com-
munity's problems, whether real
or perceived. I view this as very
positive.”

Student Government Board
President Craig Jackson brought
up the subject of improvements
to the bus lane on Fifth Avenue.

Jay Rawlings, who interacts
with residents, local businesses,
the city and Port Authority Tran-
sit concerning the buslane, said
"After painting the Fifth Avenue
curbs blue, yellow, then orange

in trials, it was decided to paint
them florescent orange. The
whole curbs will be painted; not
just those near intersections."

in addition, Rawlings said that
the orange safety rail will be in-
stalled by Port Authority all the
way from Craft Avenue to Bouqet
Street. ”Mesh webbing will be
added between the horizontal
bars, which will make it more
visible and enable more safety
signs to be posted," said
Rawlings.

Rawlings displayed a 12—square
inch tactile panel for blind pedes-
trians which is known as a "path-
finder." The panel doubles as i
buslane reminder to sighted
persons.

Posvar stated that he was op-
posed to the buslane and
preferred that parking on Forbes
Avenue be eliminated and east-
bound bus traffic run on Forbes,
rather than Fifth.

‘It's the desire of the merchants
to have parking on Forbes," said
Posvar.

Jackson brought up the subject
of increased campus phones,
which Posvar said were the
responsibility of individual
departments and asked for data
on the subject.

HamadiTd_e-nies that he led fatal h

FRANKFURT, West Germany
(AP) — Confessed hijacker Mo-
hammed Ali Hamadi denied
Wednesday that he headed the
1985 TWA hijacking that claimed
the life of a U.S. Navy diver and
kept 39 Americans captive for 17
days.

Hamadi on Wednesday also
accused witnesses of giving false
testimony after some said he
gloated over the killing of an
American passenger.

Flight engineer Benjamin Zim-
mermann said ‘on Tuesday that
Hamadi pointed with pride to
blood stains of murdered U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem on
the airplane fuselage.

Hamadi also said someone else
ordered the hijacking. But when
asked by Chief Judge Hainer
Mueckenberger, he refused to
name the man he said ordered it.

Moshoeshoe II, a government
official said.

Halfway house resi-

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The
convicted burglar charged with
sexual assault while staying at a
prison halfway house has been
charged with a second assault in

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September I5, I988

the city's Northeast section.

Earlier this week, City police
charged John Tartaglia, 29, with
robbery, burglary, indecent as-
sault, theft and criminal trespass
in the June 18 assault of a North-
east woman.

Police said a man had broken
into the woman's home at 5 a.m.,
fondled her, then fled with a
small amount of money.

Tartaglia has been in the De-
tention Center of Philadelphia
since Aug. 30, when he was
charged with the attempted rape
of an 83-year-old woman in her
Lawndale home on Aug. 27.

Before Aug. 30, he had stayed
at a prison halfway house on
Broad Street for four months. Tar-
taglia, who was serving a two-to
four-year sentence for burglary
and trespassing, worked in a fac-
tory during the day and was free
until 11 p.m. each evening. He
was permitted to spend
weekends at his parents’ Lawn-
dale home, which was near the
scenes of the attacks.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September l5, I988

Kaufman lecture series commences

By Jessica Coville
For The Pitt News

Noted scholar of chemistry and
physics, Professor Stephen Leone
of the University of Colorado, be-
gan the Second Annual Frederick
Kaufman Memorial Lecture Ser-
ies last night at the Chevron
Science Center, with a seminar
on ”Laser Probing of Chemical
Dynamics: The Torques and
Forces Between Molecules.”

The series of lectures was
formed to honor one of the most
illustrious members that the
University of Pittsburgh's chemis-
try department has ever had,
Frederick Kaufman (1919-1985).

Kaufman served as chemistry
department chairman between
the years 1977-1980 and was a
member of the National Acade-
my of Sciences. Before his death
in 1985, he and his associates

were working on the properties
regarding the stability and insta-
bility of the ozone layer.

Guest lecturer Leone attended
Northwestern University from
1966-1970 and obtained his
Ph.D. at the University of Califor-
nia in 1974.

From 1974-76, Leone was an
assistant professor of at the
University of Southern California,
where he established work on the
sulfur dimer laser and electronic-
to—vibrational
lasers.

His present position at the
University of Colorado involves
work with lasers, state-resolved
probing of photo—dissociation
dymnamics, energy transfers,
reaction dymnamics and surface
collision phenomena.

Among his many awards,
Leone has received the Coblentz
Award for spectroscopy, an Aur-

energy transfer

thur S. Flemming Award for
government service, and jointly
with student David Nesbitt and
Professor J.T. Hynes, the Nobel
Laureate Signature Award of the
American Chemical Society.

His lecture topics included the
torques and forces between
molecules and how they manifest
themselves in collisions and high-
ly rotating molecules and planes
of rotation.

For those interested in the con-
tinuing seminar by Leone,
another lecture will be presented
today at 3:30 p.m. at Ashe Au-
ditorium at the Chevron Science
Center. Today's seminar will be
concerned with ”State Distribu-
tions, Velocity Distributions and
Surface Collision Dynamics.”
Science majors and enthusists
alike are welcome and en-
couraged to participate.

Pitt’s Delta Upsilon chapter
of Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity re-
cently received the Presidents’
Club Award for their excep-
tional fund—raising efforts in
benefit of PUSH, the national
service project of the
fraternity.

They were one out of 32
fraternities to get the award at
the Pi Kappa Phi national
leadership school in Roanoke,
Va., in August. This award ac-
knowledges those Pi Kappa
Phi chapters raising over
$1,000 for PUSH through
community fund—raising and
local campus activities.

Originally standing for Play
Units for the Severely Han-
dicapped, PUSH was founded
in 1977 by a Pi Kappa Phi
brother, Thomas Sayre.

The acronym has now been
unofficially changed to stand
for People Understanding the
Severely Handicapped, since
the organization does not sim-
ply make safe toys for han-
dicapped children but also
tries to normalize life and liv-
ing accomodations for the
physically handicapped, the
mentally retarded and the
emotionally disabled.

PUSH strives for environ-
mental renovation and foster
care provisions, and designs

Fraternity raises over
$230,000 for charity

es covered with buttons to

dayrooms, private homes, and
hospitals for these children.

Jim Firster, the executive
director of PUSH, said that
”the single, biggest contribu-
tion PUSH receives is the
money that comes from the
fraternity [Pi Kappa Phi].”

This year Pi Kappa Phi
raised over $230,000 for
PUSH, which is one-fourth of
the organization's entire
budget

In 1977, Thomas Sayre visit-
ed a large state institution and
found it to be inadequate and
dangerous. The walls were
made of cinderblocks, and the
desolate dayroom was filled
with nothing but a small tele-
vision set in the corner.

He created a ”Push Play
Unit” that was constructed for
both handicapped and emo-
tionally disturbed children. It
consisted of unbreakable box-

push, each button directed
toward one of the senses.

A stereo, a series of lights, a
slide presentation and a scent-
ed air blower were just some
of the forms of entertainment
in this multi-stimulating play
environment. This wasn't just
a high—tech toy, it allowed the
children to remember that
they were still living, still peo-

White said the Oakland rail
system would serve as a ”demon—
stration project” for later exten-
sions of the rail system to the
downtown area and, eventually,
from the Golden Triangle to the
Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

Raymond Reaves, Allegheny
County planning director, said
the project ”represents a technol-
ogy that is going to be in place
in the future.”

However, according to Reidar
Bjordhovde, chairman of Pitt's
Department of Civil Engineering,
”any building is far off in the fu-
ture.” '

White said building the rail sys-
tem will cost ”many, many tens
of millions of dollars.” The Penn-
sylvania state government is not
a likely primary source of fund-
ing, according to White.

Uher said he plans to approach
private businesses for financial
and technical assistance. Several
West German companies who
have pioneered the magnetic
levitation technology are expect-
ed to cooperate with Pitt and
CMU‘ engineers.

According to White, the
cooperation of these companies
is crucial. ”We don't have the op-
tion of starting from scratch,” he
said.

ple that shouldn't be shut
away from the world.

This ”unit” was safe. It
provided a distraction for the
emotionally disturbed kids
who might. otherwise hurt
themselves.

PUSH observed that, when
violent emotionally disturbed
children were exposed to the
”unit” for a 15-minute period,
their hysterical behavior
decreased drastically.

Firster said, ”We want to
break up what we all see too
much — empty dayrooms.”

In 1981, PUSH began the
Foster Care Provision Agency.
”The ultimate environmental
renovation,” Firster said, ”is to
remove the child from the in-
stitution.”

PUSH searched for private
homes to foster all of the chil-
dren and then continued to
design the houses appropriate-
ly. Now, children who were
not capable of even dressing
themselves due to their disord-
ers could function indepen-
dently through the use of this
system of buttons.

Five productive years later,
PUSH was designing institu-
tions, schools and hospitals,
and helped with the Helen
Keller School. In 1987, PUSH
received the highest honor an
organization can receive in the
field of Mental Retardation
studies: The Richard B. Dillard
Award.

Next Friday, PUSH is invit-
ed to testify before the con-
gressional task force on the
rights and improvement of
Americans with disabilities.

The popularity of PUSH has
grown since 1977, when their
yearly income from fundrais-
ers was $12,000.

With the help of Pi Kappa
Phi, the high cost of designing
for PUSH can be met. The
fraternity brothers get to inter-
act with the disabled children
as well as gain a sense of im-
portance.

Firster finds this a rewarding
and giving experience for
these young adults because ”it
gives them more aggressive
educational practice  they
are our future business
leaders.”

OneTwoThreeFour,The Ramones are coming

By Tim Azinger

For The Pitt News

Manic—depressive is the best
way to describe the Ramones’
music. One moment you're
jumping up and down on your
bed screaming Obscenities out
your window at the next-door
neighbors, and then suddenly
you're laying on the floor crying,
recalling a past love affair.

This cycle repeats itself over
and over on every one of the Ra-
mones’ 11 releases. From ”Psy-
chotherapy” to ’’I Wanna Be
Your Boyfriend,” the Ramones

cover a wide spectrum of musi— .

cal output.

It all started back in 1974 on
the Bowery in New York City
when the Ramones decided to re-
vive the rock’n’roll that they had
listened to for so long, the rock
’n’ roll that had been slowly dy-
ing out over the years. Johnny,
Joey and Dee Dee are the origi-
nal founders of the band, and
while drummers have come and
gone, Marky is the current. The
Ramones ”brothers” are still at it.

While bubble gum/punk/rock
’n’ roll bands have had their spot
in the public eye and then faded
so quickly, the Ramones have
been going strong for the past 14
years, without changing their
penchant for sick lyrics and wit-

ty musical composition.

The band's most recent and
noteworthy release was the Ra-
mones Mania compilation. This
30—song double LP contains the
best remembered tunes that got
the Ramones where they are to-
day and kept them there. Every
formidably popular Ramones’
song is on it, and even if you have
everyone of their previous al-
bums, it's still a bit of worthwhile
rock ’n’ roll nostalgia.

The Ramones were last in Pitts-
burgh in February of 1987, and
they now grace us with their
presence again on Wednesday,
Sept. 21. While it may seem soon
for another show, fun like this

doesn't happen often, and the
chance to see the Ramones live
should be taken at all costs.

The Ramones in concert is
comparable to inviting Leather-
face, from the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre, over for tea: painfully
entertaining. Loudness and vul-
garity abound, and you might
even be able to hear some good
music, if you can decipher it over
the feedback and screams of
those insane bodies leaping off
the stage.

The group usually shies away
from their slower melodies when
on stage, so the action is furious-
ly constant. One song leads
directly into another. With one-
and two—minute songs, the band
can't afford to take too many
breaks or the audience would be-
come severely restless.

Not to be overshadowed by the
Ramones, the opening act, Jane's

Addiction, brandishes an origi-
nally diverse musical attitude.
While it doesn't contrast greatly
with the Ramones’ style, it should
add a touch of pleasurably new
sound to the show. _
Jane's Addiction hail from L.A.
and have just released their se-
cond album, Nothing’s Shocking.

‘Their first release was a self-titled

live LP. Although they are not
well- known, the band spent time
in 1987 touring with Love and
Rockets. The four-man group
plays a hip-hop, hardcore style of
music with a tainting of
psychedelia, and they put on an
interesting, invigorating show.
The Syria Mosque Ballroom is
an excellent place to have a show
of this magnitude. There's plenty
of room to ramp around and get
crazy, which makes for a giant
slam pit. There is also ample

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 15, 1988

Legendary country—blues guitarist passes on...

By Jeffrey Ressner

Rolling Stone Writer

Guitarist Roy Buchanan, whose
lightning-fast, country—blues at-
tack and use of harmonics in-
spired a generation of rock
guitarists, committed suicide on
Aug. 14 in Fairfax, Va. Buchanan,
48, was found hanged in a jail
cell shortly after he was arrested
for being drunk in public.

A spokesman for the Fairfax
county sheriff’s department said
the police responded to a call
about a family fight at Buchanan's
home, in Reston, Va., at 10 p.m.
that night. Buchanan's wife, Judy,
told the police that her husband
— who had just left the house —
had been drinking.

The police picked up Bucha-
nan several blocks away; when
his wife said she ”could not han-
dle him,” he was brought to the

»jail in Fairfax. He was intoxicat-

ed but apparently in good spirits.

At 11:16 that night, deputies
discovered Buchanan hanging in
his cell by his own shirt. His
larynx had been crushed, and at-
tepts to revive him proved futile.
He was pronounced dead at
11:59 by doctors at Fairfax
Hospital.

”Roy would often become out
of control when he was intoxicat-
ed,” said Dick Shurman,
coproducer of Buchanan's last
three albums. ”What was ironic
was that, when he got drunk, he
would tell me how he wanted his
music to heal people — all posi-
tive stuff. I'm just assuming he
was high and out of control and
committed the ultimate burst of
self—destructiveness when he

—didn1t...raali»ze what he was. doing.
This wasn’t the first time he put
his life in jeopardy by drinking.
1 really don't know if it was
remorse or pain — he had a lot
of both.”

A legendary axeman who
taught guitar skills to Robbie
Robertson and reportedly turned
down an offer to join the Rolling

Ramones

space for the less adventurous to
seek refuge from the onslaught
and enjoy the show.

Those under the impression
that the Ramones are trying to
milk their musical talents for
everything they can get shouldn't
even bother going to the show.
Any band that has stayed together
for 14 years and endured the
tribulations that most bands do is
entitled to revel in the glory of
their success.

Even if the ticket price seems
steep, it would be well worth the
money to pay homage to a band
that revolutionized a special
brand of rock ’n’ roll. Many even
say that the Ramones can be
credited with introducing punk to
America.

All interested parties should
proceed with reckless haste to the
ballroom for an evening of unfor-
gettable, rampaging fun.

Stones after Brian Jones left the
band, Buchanan released a
dozen albums with varying
degrees of success. At the time of
his death, he was planning to
return to the studio to work on an
instrumental album.

”He was my first main man,”
said Robertson. ”His imagination
on the instrument was amazing;
he strung it very high and gave it
a violin sound. People say Roy
was a very selfish guitar player,
that he wouldn’t show you [any-
thing]. But I admired him for it.
He stole everything he could with
great integrity, and i stole every-
thing I could from Roy Bu-
chanan/’

”He was so diversified on-
stage,” said Buchanan’s manager
Teddy Slatus. ”He was able to re-
late to the audience with his gui-
tar, rather than jumping and
running around or wearing fancy
costumes. His energy came from

his fingers and his heart.”

A favorite of such guitarists as
Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck,
Buchanan was known among his
peers for helping to develop the
use of guitar harmonics, the
production of overtones by tap-
ping the tops of the guitar strings.
His solos often used a trebly tone
and the kind of high-volume sus-
tain that produces powerful dis-
tortion, a sound that was mad
popular by Jimi Hendrix and Jeff
Beck.

”We used to call him the king
of the flash guitar,” said the Kin-
sey Report's guitarist, Donald
Kinsey, a former Bob Marley side-
man who recently accompanied
Buchanan. ”He just had this style
he loved doing, which was wild
but at the same time kind of slick.
He had it down.”

Born on Sept. 23, 1939, in
Ozark, Ark., Buchanan was
raised in the small town of Pix-

ley, Ca. The son of a Pentacostal
preacher, he grew up listening to
gospel music, which he heard at
revival meetings, and rhythm &
blues, which he heard on border
radio stations.

When he was 7 years old,
Buchanan was encouraged by his
father to take lessons from a lo-
cal steel—guitar teacher named
Mrs. Pressure, to whom he would
later dedicate an instrumental.

At age 15, Buchanan ran away
to Los Angeles, where he became
the protege of R&B bandleader
Johnny Otis. He soon started a
band called Heartbeats, with
whom he began traveling east.
On an Oklahoma City TV show,
he hooked up with Dale
Hawkins, the '50s rocker best
known for his hit ”Susie-Q."
Buchanan made his recording
debut on Hawkins’s 1957 single
"My Babe.”

Leaving Hawkins in the late

7

'50s and heading north for Cana-
da, Buchanan then played briefly
with Ronnie Hawkins, whose
backup group, the Hawks, in-
cluded Robertson and, later,
other future members of The
Band.

Bouncing around recording
studios, Buchanan played ses-
sions with such artists as pop
singer Freddy Cannon and coun-
try star Merle Kilgore; his first use
of harmonics on a record was on
”Potato Peeler,” a 1962 in-
strumental by drummer Bobby
Gregg. But Buchanan soon
wearied of the studio scene, and
in 19b3, he took time off to raise
his family in Reston.

Occasionaly gigging around
nearby Washington, D.C.,
Buchanan became known na-
tionally when Rolling Stone spot-
lighted him in a 1971 article, and
the Public Broadcasting System

Buchanan

Continued from page 7.

I aired a documentary about him

called ”The Best Unknown
Guitarist in the World.”
Major record labels began

. knocking on his door, and he cut

five albums for Po|ydor,_ three for
Atlantic and one for the small
Waterhouse label. Two of his al-
bums —— 1972's Second A/bum

_ and 19775 Loading Zone —-

were commercially successful.
But with the exception of Second
Album, Buchanan himself was
unhappy with much of his
recorded work.

’’I think they-had something
they didn’t know what to do
with,” Buchanan recently told
Guitar World magazine, recalling
the commercial pressures at the
large labels. ”We’d try a little bit
of that. We even did a disco
record! I'm not a disco player.
They kept trying to make a hit.”
”No one ever knew what to do

with him in the studio,” said key-
boardist Malcolm Lukens, who
recorded and toured with Bucha-
nan between T973 and 1980.
”The live recordings are the
best.”

Lukens said that Buchanan's
improvisational skills may have
been his strongest suit. ’’In seven
years," he said, ’’I think I re-
hearsed with him twice.” _

Drugs and alcohol began to
take their toll; Buchanan fell off
a stage in San Francisco at a 1980
show. ”When he wasn't playing,
he would drink a lot,” said
Lukens.

The last date played by Bucha-
nan, who frequently spent more
than half the year on the road,
was a free concert on Aug. 7 in
New Haven, Conn.

Buchanan is survived by his
wife, seven children and five
grandchildren.

Mike Gottfried and his team will get their first real test of the season Saturday against OSU.

 

THURSDAY, SEPT. ‘I5, ‘I988

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

It has been 37 years since Ohio
State last played the Pitt Panthers
in Pitt Stadium. Unfortunately for
Pitt, homefield advantage meant
nothing in a 16-14 loss to the
Buckeyes.

Since that time, Pitt has not en-
joyed so much as one win against
OSU, losing three consecutive
games, including the 1984 Fies-
ta Bowl.

Pitt stands at 4-15-1 against
OSU in a series that dates back
to 1929.

But times, they are—a—changing
in Columbus, just as they did in
Pittsburgh three years ago. John
Cooper, the former coach of Ari-
zona State University, has as-
sumed the head coaching duties
for the Buckeyes after Earle Bruce
was released late last year.

With Cooper has come a new
type of Ohio State team, a young
team instilled with confidence
and pride in the great tradition
Ohio State has carried throughout
the years.

That team will be in town for
a 7 p.m. contest at Pitt stadium

THE PITT NEWS

_ Ohio State, Pitt renew traditional rivalry

this Saturday. The game will be
nationally televised by ESPN.

The same thing has happened
in Oakland since Mike Gottfried
was hired away from the Univer-
sity of Kansas three seasons ago.

Both teams are on the rise.
Pitt’s success can be measured by
the past two seasons, and one
game of a third under Gottfried
— a 14-9-1 record and an invita-
tion to the Bluebonnet Bowl last
December.

Ohio State’s success can be
gauged by one game — a 26-9
trampling of Syracuse in the sea-
son opener last week at
Columbus.

Following an 11-0-1 season last
year and despite the loss of Heis-
man Trophy runner-up Don
McPherson, Syracuse is ”proba-

bly going into the year ranked,

one of the top two teams in the
east,” said Gottfried. Ohio State?
No one was sure. Hit hard by
graduation, a new coach and a
new coaching system could have
had detrimental effects on the
Buckeye squad.

But the OSU team, consisting
of 11 of last years starters and 11

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 15, 1988

Continued from page 9 ‘T

The early weeks of the college
football season are generally a
time for heavyweight non-
conference clashes, and this
week is no exception.

The headliner this Saturday is
in Ann Arbor, where a full house
will pack Michigan Stadium to
see if the Wolverines can bounce
back from last week’s loss to
Notre_Dame with a win over the
No. 1 Miami Hurricanes. Should
Miami move on to the NFL? Stay
tuned.

Just a notch below Miami-
Michigan is Florida State vs.
Clemson and Notre Dame vs.
Michigan State. The Seminoles

still have a shot at the national
championship even though they
were blown out by Miami.

VINCE
LONGO

Notre Dame, having beaten
Michigan last week, will be try-
ing to make it two in a row
against Great Lakes state oppo-
nents, while the defending Big
Ten champion Spartans will try to
even their record at 1-1 after last
week’s shocking loss at home to
Rutgers. ~

new faces, performed admirably,
to say the least. They committed
no turnovers and only one
penalty — which was refused -
on the way to a season—opening
win.

”They didn't show any appar-
ent weaknesses,” Gottfried said.

Pitt whitewashed the Northern
Iowa Panthers and, ironically)
head coach Earle Bruce, in their
59-10 season-opening victory.

Ohio State has proven that it
can compete with quality teams
via the win over the Orangemen.
The outcome of Pitt's game was
never in doubt, despite a second
quarter defensive lapse that al-
lowed a Division I-AA UNI team
its only points of the game.

Is Pitt ready to take on a high-
caliber team such as Ohio State?
After victories over Notre Dame,
West Virginia and Penn State last

year, the answer seems to be yes. '

But Pitt has only one dozen
seniors on the squad, not all of
them starters. The inexperience of
this team will have to be made up
for in the talent it possesses.

Cooper agreed: ”Those young
football players [Gottfried’s] got,
they were certainly some of the
most highly sought—after players
in the country.”

Ohio State is talented in its own

right. But will the Buckeyes suffer I

a letdown after their near perfect
game, or will they continue to im-
prove with each week?
Obviously, the answers lie on
the shoulders of the players — or,
as Cooper mentioned, the arm of
a certain Pitt quarterback.

Pitt sends four to Olympic Games in Seoul

By Lisa Broujos
For The Pitt News

The Olympic dream (as depict-
ed in the Wonder Bread commer-
cial, where the little girl is training
at age eight for the Olympic
games, despite her belief that
Wonder Bread is the key to the
gold), is a common aspiration for
most athletes. Yet only the cream
of the crop can get a chance to
fulfill it.

Pitt is privileged to have four
people who will be among this
select group of extremely talent-
ed individuals at the 1988 games
beginning tomorrow in Seoul,
South Korea.

Roger Kingdom, who left Pitt in
1984, and was a member of the
track team, will try to recapture
the gold medal that he won in the
1984 Olympic games. Charles
Smith, the former Pitt basketball
player who graduated last year, is
a member of the 12—person U.S.
Olympic basketball team.

Women's volleyball head
coach Shelton Collier will be a
member of the coaching staff for
the U.S. Olympic women’s team.

And Dennis Atiyeh, who gradu-
ated in 1985, wrestled and
played football for Pitt, will wres-
tle for the Syrian Olympic team.

0 Kingdom returns to the
games to defend his gold medal
in the 110—meter hurdles. Should
he win, he will be the second
hurdler to win the gold medal
twice in a row. The first was Lee
Calhoun, who won in 1956 and
1960.

”He [Kingdom] hasn't lost a
race this year. He holds the fastest
time in the world at this time,”
said John Vasvary, the men's
track and field coach at Pitt. Vas-
vary believes that Kingdom, with
his ”quick confidence” and ex-
perience, has an excellent chance
at defending his title. ”lfa runner
is not at his best at a given day,
he could be in trouble, but con-
sistency is important and Roger
has been consistent.”

Kingdom has also been a con-
sistent award winner. He was the
NCAA champion of indoor and
outdoor track, the Pan—American
champion of the 110—meter hur-
dles, the outstanding performer in
the Big East Championship, and

  
 
  

the NCAA champion meet record
holder for the 55-meter hurdle
(he still holds this record).

Vasvary can remember when
he first came to Pitt to coach and
saw Kingdom jumping the hur-
dles. He called a fellow coach at
the University of Virginia and
said, ”l’ve just seen the best hur-
dler I've ever seen!” ‘

0 To compete against the
Soviet team, one of the toughest,
most physical. basketball teams
that will be at the games, will be
the opportunity of Charles Smith,
when he plays as center/forward
for the Olympic coach, John
Thompson, also the head coach

~ at Georgetown.

”The U.S. team should win,
but the Russians will probably be
the best threat of the rest,” said
Paul Evans, Pitt men's basketball
coach. According to Kimball
Smith, Pitt Director of Marketing,
the U.S. team has more finesse
and relies on a good defense to
create the offense. ”Charles’
game seems suited for the Olym-
pic style of ball,” he said. ’

Smith’s teammate last year,

sophomore guard Jason Mat-
thews, said that Smith is a versa-
tile player who can not only
shoot and rebound proficiently,
but can dribble and defend with
as much ease. ”Not many play-
ers who are 6—foot-10 can do
that,” he said.

Smith's ”genuine, sincere and
unassuming” personality is also
a strength, according to Coach
Evans. ”As good a ballplayer [as]
he is, he's that much better as a
person,” he said.

Smith's four years at Pitt near-
ly had him earmarked for Olym-
pic success. He was voted a two
year All—American, Big East Fresh-
man of the Year in 1984, and the
Big East Player of the Year last
season. His number, 32, was also
retired. He is the only basketball
player ever at Pitt to be so
honored.

0 Shelton Collier, coach of the
Pitt volleyball team for nine
years, will be a member of the
coaching staff for the Olympic
women's volleyball team. His
primary role is to scout other op-
ponents, write up game plans,

136

and help decide strategies and
tactics for the U.S. team to use.
Collier left for Seoul on Wed-
nesday. ‘

”We have to pull a major up-
set in order to win a medal,” Col-
lier said. He explained that China
is ranked first, Peru is ranked se-
cond, the Soviet Union is ranked
third, and the U.S. team is ranked
fourth. If the U.S. defeats Peru in
the early rounds of play, it has ”a
great chance of winning a me-
dal,” Collier said.

’’I’m hoping that my work has
paid off,” said Collier, who
traveled to Italy, the Soviet Un-
ion, and Germany this summer
scouting players in the various
tournaments. ”He knows how to
prepare for a game,” said Kelly
Mathias, one of his players.

Sue Hoover, Col|ier’s assistant -

coach who will take over this sea-
son while he is gone, said that he
is’a ”very knowledgable” coach.
She added that the Panther team
intends to improve while he is
gone and that his trip to Seoul is
a great opportunity for him and

"The player that scares me the
most just looking at the films that
I've seen — and the only game
we've got to go on, of course, is
the Northern Iowa game —- is the
quarterback,” Cooper said.

"Gosh almighty, how can you
not be impressed with number
15, Darnell Dickerson, 6-4,
200-pound sophomore?” Coop-
er questioned. "He looks to me
like a great athlete.”

Dickerson’s teammates seem to
agree. "He’s starting to grasp [the
offense] a little better than he did
last year,” said Pitt senior flanker
Billy Osborn. "He's a good ath-
lete, and right now, he's starting

 YOUR CAMPUS

to let his athletic ability take
over."

Dickerson completed six of 10
passes for 120 yards and two
touchdowns against Syracuse. He
also ran 63 yards on five rushes,
scoring another touchdown.

This offensive flexibilty is un-
doubtedly his greatest asset. He
possesses a 12-gauge arm, quick
reflexes and the ability to run the
option play.

But Ohio State posts a 5-2
defensive front geared to stop the
run. "We're going to try and
spread the defense a little more
so we can try to get the running
game in," Osborn said. _

Pitt also has a deep list of run-

including a scoring run of 89

Defensively, the Pitt line

three to one against Syracuse.

second game at linebacker next
to Jerry Olsavsky and Prentiss
Wright.

The Ohio State defense is
keyed by 6-3, 230—pound senior
outside linebacker Michael
McCray, an All-American candi-
date who had 71 tackles and
three interceptions in 11 games
last season. McCray was the Big
Ten Defensive Player-of-the-
Week last week.

Nose guard Mike Sullivan, an
All-Big Ten candidate who
recorded 78 tackles last year, also
returns.

"Defensively  they're strong
and tough; the secondary is very
good,” Gottfried said.

Offensively, the Buckeyes will
throw three superior running
backs at the Panthers — 5-11,
195-pound senior tailback Vince
Workman,-5-9, 220-pound senior
fullback Bill Matlock and 5-9,
200-pound sophomore tailback
Carlos Snow.

Workman led the team with
470 yards rushing last season,
while Snow was second with 381
yards and four touchdowns. Mat-
lock added an additional 61
yards.

The three combined for 196
yards and one touchdown against
Syracuse.

Springing holes for the offen-
sive backs is one of the biggest
offensive lines in the country,
averaging 280 pounds.

row also has become an offensive
force, connecting on all four of
his field goal attempts last
weekend.

The only question mark may be
at quarterback, where sophomore
Greg Frey is making his second
start.

Frey passed for 141 yards on
12 of 17 passing for one touch-
down last week.

Asked whether he would be
reluctant to go to the air should
Ohio State fall behind, Cooper
said, "Greg Frey played a little
better last week than I thought he
would, to be honest with you.

"I don't know how he's going
to react on the road, and under
a lot more pressure this week
than he had last week, but I hope
he can handle it. We'll just have
to wait and see," he added.

"You couldn't ask a quarter-
back to do much more in a first
game,” Gottfried commented.

But Gottfried may have to ask
his team to do much more in
their second game. The youthful-
ness of this team is still under
close scrutiny.

''I’m very concerned about the
matchups," Gottfried said. ''I’m
very concerned about our fresh-
men linebackers, concerned
about some of our younger guys
in other areas, whether we can
hold up or not.

"Until we're proven, or until
we're tested there's going to be
a question mark,” Osborn said.

Cooper is still concered. He
said, "They [Pitt] are going to be
sound. They're not going to beat
themselves. They're going to play
good field position, and they're
going to make you go the hard
way to win the game.”

THE‘ PITT NEWS, Thursday, sépiember’ii‘5‘, ‘I988

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
was born in Crestline, Ohio,
not too far from the campus of
Ohio State University. Yet, he
wouldn’t call himself a Buck-
eye fan.

”When everybody else
went to OSU games, I went to
Bowling Green,” Gottfried
said. ”Jack Harbaugh was their
coach at the time and him be-
ing my cousin, well, I went
down there a lot.

a fan of either team. I have al-
ways just loved the gameof
football, so you could say I just
liked every school. I enjoyed
football of all types.”

Still, the Panther game this
Saturday still holds something
special for Gottfried.

”They have a great deal of
tradition over there,” Gottfried

. said. ’’I have a great deal of
respect for Ohio State. The tra-
dition goes all the way through
to their coaches. I mean, peo-
ple like Woody Hayes are
legends of the game.

”But I wouldn't call myself *

Gottfried is still an
”Ohioboy” at heart

”But we can’t get too caught
up in all that. Our players have
to realize that the tradition
runs just as thick here.”

Gottfried got his coaching
start at Norwalk High School
in St. Paul, Ohio. During his
four-years (I967—I970) at the
school, Gottfried got became
up in the OSU tradition.

”Sometimes it seemed
everything revolved around
Ohio State football,” Gottfried
said. ”As a high school coach,
it's hard not to get caught up
in all of that.

”Then, later on in my career
as a college coach [Young-
stown State ahd Cincinnati], it
was just as high.”

A little bit of Gottfried’s past
came back to him last Satuday
as he watched the OSU-
Syracuse game on CBS.

”I was listening to their fight
song and alma mater during
the game, and I think they
used the same one our high
school used. In fact, I think
everybody in Ohio uses the
same fight song and alma
mater,” Gottfried said. ”That’s
what I call tradition."

”Everything he's done with [the
Olympic team] has helped us,”
said Janelle Lantagne, a member
of the Pitt team. Mathias also said
that Collier still plays in a league

coaches

dual citizenship in the U.S. and
Syria, will wrestle in the

0 This just in: sources say that
former Dallas Cowboy quarter-
back Clint Longley was recently
seen in a Houston bar wearing a
Cody Carlson disguise. More on
that story at 11.

Rande Stottlemyer, the
wrestling coach for Pitt, said that
Atiyeh is a ”tough kid” with
”good character.” He added that
the ”competition is not quite as
keen in Syria as in the States,” so
Atiyeh had a better chance at
making the team in Syria.

”I don't know how he meas-
ures up to the other competitors,
but I know he'll be scrapping for
a medal,” Stottlemyer said.

Atiyeh is 6'1 and weighs ap—
proximately 220 pounds.

Along with wrestling in the
Olympics, Atiyeh is married, has
three children and owns the

is not just a ”best buddy” and a
”hard working athlete,” but ”he
would give you the shirt off of his
own back.”

Atiyeh’s brother, Joe, won the
first and only medal Syria has
ever earned in the Olympiad in
1984. He also wrestled.

These athletes and coach have
given the Olympics a personal
touch for the University of Pitts-
burgh, and , regardless of the out-
come in each of their personal
sports, the Pitt community can be
proud of the success that King-
dom, Smith, Collier and Atiyeh
have brought to the university
and themselves.

  Famed Celtic revivalists

set to pipe this Friday

By Cathleen Karlsson
Staff Writer

Irish folk—music revivalists Liam
O’Flynn and Donal Lunny are set
to perform at 8 p.m. on Friday at
Graffiti. O’Flynn and Lunny have
both played significant roles in
reviving Celtic traditions of Irish
music during the past 20 years.

O’Flynn grew up surrounded
by traditional Irish musical talent.
His talent and interest were in-
herited from both sides of the fa-
mily, though it was not a relative
who eventually introduced him
to the Uileann pipes (bagpipes) of
which he is a highly acclaimed
player.

Lunny was raised in New-
bridge, lreland. During the
mid—’60s, he played with musi-
cians such as those in The Rakes

of Kildare and The Emmett
Spiceland.

Lunny and O’Flynn joined
together in 1970, along with a
few others, to form the group
Planxty. The group was ac-
claimed for its various music
styles and toured for three years
until the members separated in
1973.

Planxty reformed and played
from 1973 through 1982, finally
evolving into The Moving Hearts.

Since the breakup of The Mov-
ing Hearts, the two musical artists
have maintained separate, but
not completely diverse careers.
O’Flynn continues as a soloist,
while Lunny is a record producer
and film soundtrack composer.

Kuntu season premiere features all-female cast

Six dynamic black women will
share center stage spotlight in P.J.
Gibson's two—act drama, ”Long
Time Since Yesterday,” the sea-
son opener for Kuntu Repertory

The two—act drama is a riveting,
emotional story about contem-
porary and successful long—time
friends and college classmates,
reunited following the suicide of
their most cherished friend.

In this complex drama, the
playwright delves into the mys-
terious core of female relation-
ships through the issues of
eroticism, alcoholism, self-images
and social obligations. The topi-

Moon Over Parador doesn't shine on Dreyfuss

By Jeffrey Sullivan
For The Pitt News

Richard Dreyfuss plays Jack
Noah, a New York actor shooting
a movie on location in the ficti-
cious Central American country
of Parador. When Alfonse Simms,
the dictator of Parador, dies un-

gxpectedly of a heart attack, dras-
tic measures are called for.
Roberto (Raul Julia), a nightclub
proprietor (and head of Parador’s
national police), hires Noah to
portray Simms.

The role of Parador’s dictator is
the biggest role of Noah's life,
and how can he refuse when
Roberto makes him his offer: ’’If
you don't do it, I'll kill you,”

Noah takes the role for a few
days until Roberto can get the
presidential succession in order,

g but the two days stretch into a

year, and hilarity ensues as Noah
leads the country into a bevy of
wacky situations. Or at least that's
the formula. And, as formulas go,
it has promise — in this case,
mostly unfulfilled.

Director, producer and co-
writer Paul Mazursky, who
brought us the smash hit come-
dy Down and Out in Beverly
Hills, serves up Moon Over
Parador. However, Moon fails to
live up to the legacy of Down
and Out for several reasons.

One of the main reasons that
Down and Out was so good was
that it had a full cast of interest-
ing characters, each blending into
the plot and forming a cohesive
whole. In Moon, the only real
characters are Noah and Rober-
to. Noah's love interest, Madon-
na (played by Sonia Braga),
comes close, but ends up as an

intriguing collection of charac-
teristics rather than a fleshed-out
character.

Another drawback with the
film is that it is (for no apparent
reason) told in flashback form,
with Noah breaking in for narra-
tion just often enough to jar the
viewer out of the spell of the sto-
ry. Since it is told in flashback, we
never have to worry about
whether Noah will survive his tri-
als and tribulations, and the ”sur-
prise” ending falls rather flat.

Dreyfuss, who played the
angst-ridden father so well in
Down and Out, manages to
make the best of his role as Jack
Noah. But Julia, as the
Machiavellian advisor Roberto,
steals the show. His character is
easily the most interesting in the

lot, and he upstages Dreyfuss in
nearly every scene they share.
Sadly, even this character is a
stereotype, and Julia, try as he
might, cannot rise far above it.

Just when the story should be
swinging into high gear, it drops
into neutral with the introduction
of the dictator’s mother and a se-
quence of scenes that not only
die, but serve no purpose in the
film other than to fill time. This
part of the film is a prime oppor-
tunity to nip off to the snack bar
or bathroom, but for my $4.50,
I'd prefer some actual enter-
tainment. »

The introduction of some
heavy-handed military conflict is
also thrust upon the viewer at this
time. It only further confuses the
thrust of the film.

Although the film was enter-
taining, I expected more. With
the cast of Moon, including
cameos by Jonathan Winters,
Sammy'Davis, Jr., and Dick
Cavett, veteran screenwriter
Mazursky should have had no
trouble coming up with a hit.
That he barely succeeded in this
indicates to me that he really

failed.

Bishop's letter worth
little consideration

A letter penned by Catholic Bishop Donald Wuerl and slat-
ed to be published this week in the Pittsburgh Catholic en-
courages all Catholics to oppose a proposed gay-rights
amendment to Pittsburgh's Human Relations Act.

Bishop Wuerl states that if the amendment were approved,
it would infringe on the rights of the Catholic Church, which
believes that, although homosexual orientation is tolerable,
homosexual activity is immoral. Wuerl wants to ensure that
what he terms as the moral teachings of the Catholic Church

' are not compromised by the legislating of a piece of law that

would force the church schools to select individuals whose
very presence would contradict the church's belief.
Wuerl’s defense of the Catholic Church, however, is not
quite on par. Pennsylvania state law does not make homosex-
‘uality illegal and, therefore, contradicts the Catholic posi-
tion. The ”right" for the Catholic Church to practice
”religious freedom" to discriminate is overridden by
homosexuals’ rights to be protected from discrimination.
The American legal system must protect the rights of the
individual. Under United States law, homosexuals and het-
erosexuals alike have the same rights to employment, edu-
cation and every other freedom granted the citizens of this
country. Although the law must also protect the rights of pub-
lic and private institutions, in this case, Bishop Wuerl is mis-
interpreting that obligation. Nowhere in the Constitution is
any person or institution granted the right to discriminate
against another, be it on the basis of sexual orientation, or
for any other reason. The Constitution does note, however,
a clear division between the powers of church and state.

Talking about the 'Duke' wi

”You wanna know about our
’Duke'?" asked the cabbie, as I
settled back in the taxi at Logan
Airport.

"Sure," I said, noticing that the
meter, which starts at $1.30 here,
_was already running.

”What kinda business are you
in?" he asked.

"I'm a newspaper columnist.”

That wasran invitation to a
15-minute monologue on po-
litics. ’

"My name is Mario Costa, and
I'm a lifelong Democrat,” he
volunteered. ’'I voted for Mon-
dale in '84. But I'll tell ya some-
thing. If Dukakis gets in, we're
really in trouble.”

"Why’s that?”

"Because I guarantee you if he
gets in, we're going to have a
recession. We'll probably have
one anyway with Bush, but it will
be less severe. And Dukakis will
raise taxes, without question."

The way Dukakis has tried to
balance the state budget irks
Mario Costa and a lot of other
people in Boston. They don't like

the minimum $50 speeding fines
plus $10 increases for every mile
per hour over the limit. They
don't like the metermaids who

meters like vultures, anxiously
waiting for the ”expired" sign to
appear so they can write a ticket
that will bring additional revenue
to the treasury. And they don't
like the new scale of fees and tax-
es, including a new 5 percent tax
increase on cigarettes. Some of
them have taken to calling their
state "Tax-achusetts."

Mario asked why so many Mas-
sachusetts residents are moving
to New Hampshire, then an-
swered his own question: ”I’ll tell
you why. It's because of taxes.”

Arriving at the hotel, I realized
that this is the first time I have
ever taken notes on a conversa-
tion with a cab driver.

One man's parking problems

Last Saturday afternoon, I sleep-
ily stumbled into the Pitt book-
store to purchase a much
overpriced source of media that
a professor tells me I'll definitely
need, even though I'll only use it
twice (beginning and end of the
semester —— my two most motivat-
ed times). Iwill return this book
in the same ”new” condition that
I bought it in, only receiving half
of what I paid for it. The Pitt

' bookstore, however, will replace

that book on the shelf and charge
at least another $35 for it. Real-
ly, does Pitt need to make any
more money than it already does?

To make matters worse, the
lady at the register, a woman who
could easily pass for my dead
Great Aunt Bertha and who could
seriously use the Pitt elective Per-
sonality and Fresh Breath IOI,
crabbily and bitterly informs me
that my student ID is not valid
and neither are all the other 37‘/2
forms of ID that are stacked up on
the counter.

Then, I'm walking back to my
candy-apple red Porsche 151 to

In my room, I dialed room serv-
ice for dinner.

”Why are there no prices on
the room service menu?" I in-
quired of the woman who an-
swered the phone. '

"Because of all the extras we
have to charge for," she said.
"And," she added, ”if Dukakis
gets in the White House, it will
be this way for the entire coun-
try." The one monetary entry on
the menu is a "5 percent Mas-
sachusetts old age tax."

It is not true that Dukakis is so
boring he cannot arouse the elec-
torate. Two others I met while in
Boston volunteered harshly criti-
cal opinions of Dukakis’ tenure as
Massachusetts governor.

Several polls released last week
indicated that Dukakis has been
losing ground to George Bush in
his home state. Bush's barrage of
criticism that Dukakis would do
for the nation what he has done

for Massachusetts appears to be

a good strategy that is helping to
win him votes, not only in Mas-
sachusetts, but in the rest of the

find that my car, really a '72
Buick, is beingtowed. I. run up to
the cop, a woman who looks like

MARK
STAF

Hulk Hogan on even more
steroids after just bench pressing
the earth, and scream at her, "Ex-
cuse me while you live out your
fantasies as a man, you evil cross
between woman and pit bull, but
you're towing my blankety- blank
car." Actually, I said this to my-
self. What I really said was, "Wh-
wh‘-why are you t-towing my
c-car?"

And this pit bull woman replies
in a sandpaper—Darth Vader
voice, ”YOU SEE THAT SIGN?”
And she points to this tiny little
yellow sign’ about 10 miles away
and continues, "NO PARKING
AFTER FOUR O'CLOCK."

The whole time, some Gomer
is laughing in a type of voice that
makes you think of the movie

country.

That Bush could be doing so well
in Massachusetts, a state with a
three-to-one Democratic voter
registration advantage, and a state
that Ronald Reagan carried in
both 1980 and '84, is an indica-
tion that Dukakis may be far
more vulnerable nationally than
suggested by the current polls,
which show the race to be a
tossup.

The Bush strategy is to tell the
country who the real Michael
Dukakis is. If the Bush people
were smart, they would send
their campaign TV commercial
crew to Boston and talk to the
working folks like Mario the cab
driver, the room service lady and
a lot of other residents who don't
like their governor, and have
them say what they think about
the way Dukakis has run Mas-
sachusetts.

The tenuous nature of Dukakis’
home base support was ex-
pressed by Howard P. Foley,
president of the Massachusetts
High Technology Council, a bus-

Deliverance and that his parents
were brother and sister, while lift-
ing my car off the ground with a
tow truck.

At this point, I reach into my
pocket and pull out a $50 dollar
bill and ask, "Hey, did anyone
lose this?" Again, to myself I did
and said this. What I really did
was start groveling like any nor-
mal person would do if he were
either about to be killed or have
his car towed. This groveling only
made Gomer laugh just a little
harder and turned Robocop into

‘more of a mountain man.

So, I go to the MAC machine
to get some cash to bail my car
out of car-purgatory because I
know these Gomers will only ac-
cept either cash or drugs for pay-
ment. Due to the fact that I am a
starving writer and comedian, the
receipt from the MAC machine

reads "insufficient funds."
My parents come to my rescue

and put up the bail money at only
7 percent interest and tack on the
"How Could You Be So Irrespon-
sible?” speech at no extra charge.
Mark Staf is a columnist for The
Pitt News.

th at taxicab driver

iness lobbying group: "If he wins,
Dukakis will have an easier time
being president than if he came
back to be governor."

Partisan though he may be, the
co-chairman of the Bush cam-
paign in Massachusetts, David H.
Locke, voiced the thoughts of
many of those I met when he
said, ’’If I had a nickel for every
prominent Democrat who has
encouraged me to help defeat
Dukakis, you just wouldn't be-
lieve it."

Bush's offensive strategy and
his constant hammering away at
the Dukakis image of "competent
governor" is working. Far from
worrying about peaking too soon,
