Inoculation Gun To Be'|_'es1'ed

--Poetry Reading Planned

For Tuesday Afternoons

By DONNA CONSIDINE -

‘The Poetry Group, sponsored by the Humanities Society,
will begin its third semester on campus tomorrow at 3:30
p.m. in the Aldred Room, sixth ﬂoor library.

Dr. Charles R. Crow of the Department of English will
initiate the new series of selections with a discussion of
“The Verse of Shakespeare’s Later Plays.”

 -I ‘ With the exception of two meet—%

ings the program will be held on
Tuesdays instead of Thursdays as
they were previously.

Precedent Set

According to Jack Kolbert, as-
sistant professor in Modern Lan-
guages and one of the group’s or-
ganizers, the success of these read-
ings sets a precedent for programs
of this type here at Pitt.

He added, “Our main purpose
is to offer to students one hour
each week during which they
can come in contact with the
great universal themes of world
literature as read by persons

A outstanding in their ﬁelds.”

Members of the‘ committee in
charge of the Poetry Reading
Group in addition to Kolbert are:
Ruth Haun, assistant professor of
speech; W. George Crouch, chair-
man of the English Department:
Michael McHa1e, assistant profes-
sor of speech and director of Pitt
Players; Putnam Jones, Dean of
Graduate Faculties; Lorena Gar-
loch, University librarian; William
C. Panetta, assistant professor of
classics; and George B. Fowler,
professor of history.

Loses Beauty

The committee feels that there
has been much poetry written

' which appeals to the sense of

hearing and unless it is recited, It
often loses much of its inner
beauty.

The second speaker of the cur-
rent series will be Joseph Harsky
of the Department of Modern
Languages. He will do a bi-lingual
Russian-English reading from
“Pushkin, the Russian Shakes-
peare” Tuesday, March 5. This
program and those to follow will
be held in the Aldred Room at
3:30 on Tuesdays unless otherwise
stated.

Dr. Donald Tritschler, assist-
ant professor of English, will

Volunteers
To Receive

No-Jab Shot  

By JIM MARINO

«A volunteer group of 165
engineering ’ students at the
University of Pittsburgh will
receive their free polio inocu-
lations by means of a multiple,
dose inoculation gun which
does not use a needle.

The gun operated by injecting a
very thin, high speed stream of

inoculum (substance to be inocu- '

lated) under high pressure through
the skin.

The group of engineers will be
divided in half. Half will receive
their inoculations by means of the
standard hypodermic syringe and
needle. The two groups are both
composed of men from 17 to 20
years of age. Blood samples from
the two groups will be compared
to determine the effectiveness of
the inoculation gun. The samples
will be taken before and from
two to four weeks after the inoc-
ulations are given.

Military Uses Gun

This is the ﬁrst use of the gun,

in the inoculation of the polio

‘vaccine. The gun has been_used

successfully in mass ‘inoculation
programs in the military service.

If this study proves that the"
gun can. eﬂectively inject the
vaccine it will simplifv the ad-
ministration of mass inocula-
tion. The use of the gun will
eliminate the need for wash-
ing and sterilizing and the
time-consuming task of the
syringe prior to each inocula-
tion. This process will speed
the inoculations and eliminate
the need for several workers.

Since the secondary purpose of
the program at Pitt is to demon-
strate thepeffectiveness and prac-

ticality of mass inoculation, the»

simplicity and speed of adminis-
tering the vaccine are important
factors in the program.

Students Reminded

Students are reminded that if

they have not yet received an
appointment choice card they are

(Continued on page 2)

POLIO CARDS

Any student who has not
completed an appointment
preference card indicating his
ﬁve half-hour choices for the
polio inoculations must do so at
the Information Center on the
Fifth Avenue side of the Com-
mons Room. Any student who
has improperly ﬁlled out the
‘card by not indicating his
choice on the reverse side or
any student who has ﬁlled out
more than one card must ﬁll
out a new card to cancel the
improper or duplicate card at
the Information Center. The
Center will also provide ap-
pointments for any student who
does not receive his ﬁnal ap-

pointment by tomorrow.

A SW9//ed Cltest 

Through the enthusiasm of committee workers and a

comprehensive publicity program a grand total of $2800

has been collected by the Pitt Chest Fund. ,
The unprecedented generosity of the student body de-

q

.serves separate applause in helping to attain this total. ’

It seems a modest victory .when the-fact that dona-

tions are small in proportion tothe size of the student body ’

-is taken into consideration. But a victory it is and the laurels
should be passed out. »

Those students who have already contributed to the
Chest will be satisﬁed to‘ know that their contributions have
set an all—time record for the ten—year history of the fund.
-But the real victory for Sam Reich and his committee will
be realized in the attainment of the original goal of $3500.
This goal is now very much within reach. ".

Mass donations and a clean—up campaign will make the
goal a reality. Such organizations as the Pitt Players who
have pledged the entire receipts of their ﬁrst performance
of “Stalag 17” and the Freshman class which is presenting
a beneﬁt Talent Show March 29 have shown the spirit
and generosity needed for pushing the fund over the top.

There are also some 3000 students who have yet to be
contacted for possible donations. To ﬁnish this job about
300 students will. be needed to telephone the students for
contributions. . — ‘A

Pitt, Probation

columns on the impressions of Pitt after one

Writers Scholarship.) B

By Jay Butler

It has to be funny for them when they tell it.
When they come together, two or three of them
and sometimes more standing in awkward, self-
conscious knots, the question comes ﬁrst with their
eyes and a certain caution in their faces. But when
they ﬁnally ask it they have to laugh. They have
to laugh because it is the only thing they can do
in that vacuum of words and   —
emotions. 

They are the ones that didn’t
make it. They are those who
were placed on probation or who
were permitted to register after
the fall semester. The terrify-
ing thing is that they should~be
so many, that they shouldbe able
to find the others who will laugh
with no more of a search than I W
a common question in their eyes. They form a-
single, dramatic, concrete testimony to the inade-
quacy of both their own backgrounds and of edu-
cation atiPitt. ,

Left With Confidence

They left high school conﬁdent that they were
going to become doctors or teachers or scientists
to heal the festering sore of our world. Now they
stand in their groups of two’s and three’s. And
they never stand in the same ‘group twice because
there is only one question to ask and after -that
the vacuum.

.No one seems to have any exact ﬁgures on the
proportion of students on probation and NPR; The
average is certainly considerably below the thirty-
ﬁve percent of freshmen not permitted to register
in the School of,Business Administration, which is
in a process of intensive culling in preparation for
transition to professional school status. Whatever
the number is, it is too high. , _

Only about half of this year’s. entering fresh-
men will survive to be graduated after four years.
That this ﬁgure ‘conforms to the national average,
serves only to show that Pitt is far from being the
great pniversity to which it aspires.

The sources of this failure are not impossible to
locate. It is of course possible that the admissions

policy has been partly at fault in accepting stu-
dents who are not capable of success on the col-

lege level. The keystone of the policy has been to »

admit students who graduate in the upper two-ﬁfths
of their high school class, and the existing qualiﬁ-
cations to this basic policy do not signiﬁcantly alter
its fundamentally impersonal character.

Find Solutions

There is good reason to believe that the new ’

Office of Admissions will ﬁnd solutions to the
problems which exist in this area. In the‘ meantime
we face the problem of either cutting out the dead
wood, a step which can not be justly taken, or of
bearing the burden. .

There remain as sources of the failure the pro-
cesses of the institution after entrance and the stu-
dent’s lack of determination to help himself. I

have dealt previously with the failure of the Uni- V
versity, in a large number ofcases, to deal ade-‘Y;

quately with the individual. The student, for in-
stance, ﬁnds it difficult to bridge the gap between
lecture, laboratory, and textbook when little or no
attempt is made at coordinations~ by the depart-
ment. In discussing the point with others, I have
found that in many classes the teacher has no

‘prepared lesson plan, but on the basis of a familiari-

ty with the subject iy question prefers to impro-

vise. I have also. treated the opposite extreme of

the virtuoso performance.

We come inevitably to the individual student
and his responsibility to himself. It would be in-
accurate to assume that the University alone is at

fault. Education is in the ﬁnal analysis largely a-...-

result of individual determination and initiative.

Certainly, considerably more than ﬁfty percent of ‘

the freshman class has the ability to complete‘ four
years of college education. The student himself
must learn to approach this serious business as an
adult. It is time to reconvert the libraries from
social centers to places of study. To say that quan-
tities of" time are wasted in the.Tuck Shops is an
understatement. Perhaps through some supreme
effort of the will the fraternities could dispense with
their Deriodic hocus-pocus and concentrate full-
time on providing the valuable social foundations
of which only they are capable.

It IS easy to start dreaming at the end of a
column, but sometimes I wonder if we tightened
up‘ the screws generally, we migm-mt wakeup one
of these days with
hands.

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reference to the column on
“The Factory Theory.” I am con-
vinced that the truth has ﬁnally
been seen. In order to form an
opinion of the University resemb-
ling a “factory or assembly line”
.type of education, a student must
be subjected to wide propaganda
on it. I believe that Miss Cher-
ington hits the real meat of the
subject when she talks of the lack
of class participation and student-
faculty panel discussions and the
lack of enthusiasm in the students

Many of my instructors have al-
most pleaded with the class in
telling them that their offices are
open and that the instructor is al-
ways willing to hold informal and

the Ed ‘to I
, informative discussions in their
offices expressly for the students.
It is clearly seen that the pr?)-
paganda that Pitt is a factory
is provided for freshmen and in-
coming students by word of
mouth. The Pitt student who takes
advantage of the opportunities for
enlightenment in’ all ﬁelds does

widespread propaganda. It is
rather the student who fails to
participate, and therefore does not
know Why the University appears
to be a factory to him, that must
become aware of th e things
around him. He must become
aware of Pitt, the University, not \
Pitt, the factory.

Merrnen Suffer
Seventh Defeat
At Navy, 75-11

' By MURRAY CHASS

Navy handed the Panther
swimmers one of their worst
defeats in some time Satur-

' day night, 75-11.

In scoring the overwhelm-
ing victory over the locals, the
men of Annapolis won all ten

' events and took points for seven

of the runner-up spots.

The Panthers managed to cap-
ture two places in only one event
and that was the diving in which
Burt Marks and Milo Fischer
placed second and third respec-
tively.

Two Records Set

Along with their clean sweep of
the ten events, the Middies set
two new Naval Academy records.
The crack Navy medley relay
quartet of Marshall Greer, Bob
Duppenthaler, Bill Neville, and
Tim Anderson splashed through
the 400-yard medley relay in
4:01.l to start the meet in the An-
napolis pool for one of the marks.
This chopped 2.6 seconds off the
old Academy record.

The other record-breaking
feat was performed by Bruce
Friederich in the 200-yard
breaststroke. His winning time,
2:29, was two and nine-tenths
seconds faster than the old
mark. V 2

The Panthers’ breaststroker, Ed
Robson, was instrumental in help-
ing Friederich set the record by
“pushing” the Midshipman ace
throughout the ﬁrst 175 yards of
the race. At that point Robson
was just one yard behind the
eventual winner, but he was un-

’ able to pull past him.

White Places Third

captain Warne White, wound up

stood at 15-1, and the rout had
just begun.

The Middies won the first two
places in both the 200-yard
butterfly and the 50-yard free-
style before the Panther divers
broke the string with their sec-
ond and third place ﬁnishes.
Even with the four points in one
event, the local tankers still
trailed by a good margin, 36-7.

Tourney Chance Slides;

Hennon Nets 38 Points

By ED KOLTISKA

The Panther cagers were momentarily sidetracked in
their attempt for an NCAA or NIT bid last Saturday night
as the West Virginia Mountaineers outscored the Oakland-
ers 107-93 before 6,800 fans at Morgantown.

The 107 points represented the second highest score ever
amassed against the Jungle Cats and the highest scored so

far this season. Ohio State regist-%

ered 100 points against the Panth-
ers in the second game of the sea-
son while the highest score by an
opponent is credited to Navy with
108 in the 1953-54 season at Anna-
polis. .
Not only did the players have a
ﬁeld day scoring points but the
officials had a ‘ftime of their lives”
blowing the whistle as they called
58 fouls before the ﬁnal buzzer.

Fouls Numerous

With seven minutes remaining,
there were no less than ten men
in the line-up with four personals
on each of them. Within the next
six minutes the Oaklanders lost
three via the foul route in John
Riser, Julius Pegues, and Barry
Brautigam, while the Mountain-
eers only lost Lloyd Sharrar.

The Panthers virtually lost
the game in the first half as the
Mountaineers took a command-
ing lead of 25-9 with only
eight minutes gone.

Coach Fred Schaus had his
Mounties use a tight defense
which forced the Jungle Cats to
shoot from the outside. This prov-

. ed to be the downfall as the Pan-

thers could only hit on 31 per cent
of their shots while West Virginia
clicked on 51 per cent.

Hundley Still Nemesis
This barrage by the Mountain-
eers gave them a half time lead
of 53-39. Although trailing by 14
points, the Oaklanders were un-
able to repeat last year’s perform-

ance When they came from behind
-—trailing 17 points—- to defeat the
Mountaineers by 17. 

Hot Rod Hundley again, as in
the past, made his presence
known as he led the West Vir-
ginia scoring attack with 39
points to close out alsuccessful
season against the Panthers.

In three years and six‘ games
against the Jungle Cats Hundley
has scored 200 points and played
in only one losing game. That loss
occured last season at Morgan-
town as the Blue and Gold drub-
bed the Mounties 94-77.

Hennon Gets Hot

This year, however, Hundley
had keen competition from sopho-
more sensation Don Hennon. Hen-
non’s shooting ability kept Hund-
ley from performing his usual
antics for the over-capacity crowd
until the 18 .minute mark of the
second‘ half.

Against T ech, 47 - 33

By l)AVID BREAKSTONE
The Panther gymnastics team, employing the same tac-
tics which beat Navy a week ago, came from behind to
defeat Georgia Tech 47-33 at the Field House on‘Saturday

night.

Coach Warren Neiger’s Panthers picked up 25 points on
the parallel bars and ﬂying rings, the ﬁnal events, to clinch

their third straight match and:

sixth out of eight this season.
A small crowd witnessed

something of an oddity as only

ﬁve of the
scheduled six
T events were
p e r f o rmed.
The high bar
event “elimi-
nated itself.”

T e C h ’ s Ben

man performing
in the event,
was swinging
high and wide
when suddenly
the bar began to dip dangerously
and a little later thevheavy ap-
paratus gave way completely and
crashed to the ﬂoor.. The alert
Stokes leaped clear. A joint fas-
tening had snapped and couldn’t
be repaired, so the whole event
was cancelled.

Jim Weeks of Georgia Tech won
the ﬁrst competition, tumbling, as
Pitt’s Jack Hammond, Dave Hirst,

places. Tech’s two versatile gym-'

nasts Jon Parker and “Bo” Stokes
placed one-two on the side horse
with Jim Mulvihill, C'huck Kerber,
and Joe Lamartine picking up the
remaining points.

speedy Dave Ruber repeated his
feat of scaling the 20-foot rope
in four seconds to add six points

Frosh, 85-60

By MIKE GERBER

Coach Carl Peterson’s Pan-
.ther Cubsilfell victim to the
West Virginia frosh for the
second time inas many tries
this season in the preliminary
contest to the varsity pairing

on Saturday night. The ﬁnal score
was 85-60, and put the locals’ re-
cord at 6-8.

The jubilant West Virginia fans,
who take their freshman team al-
most as seriously as t e varsity,
were treated to a magni cent dis-
play of ball—handling, defense.

. and shooting.

The undefeated Mountaineer
frosh, in making the Panther
Cubs their 16th victim of the
season, performed ‘with re-
markable poise and conﬁdence.
Their passing was almost fault-
less, their shooting accurate,
and their defense alert as they
made relatively short work of
the slower Panthers.

Led by the fabulous Jerry West
-—perhaps a future All-American,
and Willy Akers, just a shade be-
low West-—the Mounties went far
ahead almost immediately and
were never in any serious trouble.
The Ridgerunners led at the end
of the ﬁrst half, 38-27.

Th e Panther Cubs, playing
without the services of star for-
ward Gene Masseri, were out-
classed because of their inability
to hit from the ﬁeld. Only center
Johnny Mills was able to hit with
any consistency for ‘ﬁe Blue and
Gold.

Mills wound up the evening
with 19 points to lead the Pan-
thers in scoring. Tom Maloney
and Bill Mauro each had elev-
en points to follow Mills in the
scoring column. "

The Mountaineers, who substi-
tuted liberally, wereled in scor-
ing by Akers and West who talli-

ed 24. and 23 points respectively.

this advantage as they had the
next fastest times and won nine
points among them. ’

With Pitt now ahead 34-30, Tom
Darling put a lock on the victory
with a graceful performance on
the flying rings. Hammond and
Hirst did almost as well in taking
down second and third places.
After the meet, Coach Neiger
expressed relief at having won.
“We gbt off to a ragged start,” he
said, “and that high bar elimina-

noted that it was the ﬁrst time an
accident of that sort had happened
at Skyscraper U. but that he’d
seen it happen elsewhere before.

WELL you just did. Detroit was so sure you’d like
their new cars they invested $1 billion in 1957
model change-overs. Detroyitfs winning its bet, getting
its money back. But the real winner in two ways—is you.

First of all, when you get a new car, you'll be getting
the finest car money ever bought. A car as exciting to
look at as to drive. With new, lower styling, exciting
new colors. Powered with surging horsepower for the
super highway age.

Second, you'll cash in on a booming economy. When
Detroit produces cars everybody wants, they keep more
people working. Help more people buy them. There’s
more money to support more businesses. More job
opportunities for you.

Backing up the dramatic newness of the 1957 cars
is the sturdy dependability the world associates with
American cars. We know about this dependability be-
cause we work hand-in-hand with car manufacturers

 

How does it feel to Win a billion dollar bet ? ,

to put it there. Every make of American car uses Timken”
tapered roller bearings to reduce friction--help handle
the heavier loads of today’s high speed driving.

The vital role Timken bearings play in making cars
and machinery for all industry better than ever helps
keep us steaming ahead. And because it makes sense
to join a winning team, you may be interested in the
f_x_iture the Timken Company can offer college grad-
uates. For details, write for our booklet "Career Oppor-
