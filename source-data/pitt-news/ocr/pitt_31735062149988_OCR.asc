1 Scenes Swing; are Pits‘ Premier

‘.-Vh-an a swing band is considered
a. scientific experiment, t'.hat’s news
on the order of “man bites dog.”
Such a one is that of ‘Hill Bradley
and his orchestra, who will play for
the Pitt Premier Friday night in the
Urban room of ‘Hotel William Penn.

Having reduced the process of
forming a band to a methodical
science, Willard Alexander, known
as the Svcngali of Swing in the mu-
sical ~ world, named Will -, Bradley,
trombonist, as leader of ‘the new
band.u Willard then hired Ray Mc-
Kinley, :ormerjdrummer to Jimmy
llorsey, and other ace ‘performers
of the best bands in the country.
The result is a band that combines
sweet music with that of swing, and

'I_‘l1e first ‘of three complimentary
"tickets to the Pitt Premier was won
by Mae Goldblum, C44. Miss Gold-
blum was the ﬁrst to guess the
correct titles of the first two car-
toons in the contest sponsored- by
‘ the ,jPremi_er._._' The. titles are:
-‘.‘Playmate's” and “'1‘he Little Man
W110 Wasn’t. There.” ' ' V .

emphasizes good performance rather
than ‘a’ distinct ‘style. A A '

Willard Alexander obviously knew
what he was doing, having created
Benny Goodman, King of Swing.
His process consists of listening
to hundreds of records, noting care-
fully the instrumentalist “breaks”
CI" solos. *-The best of theseViper—
formers he takes to‘ make up a com-
plete orchestra. A ,

This method of simply “creating’
a, band, using a meth-odical, scien-
tific system and emphasizing good
perfori'nance'rather‘. than style, was
the method Alexander -used in
forming the -band of Will Bradley
and orchestra. - ,

eral other Bradley recordings,

0 Draft

_ By Irwin Rosen
Instead of the long-expected, ef-
ﬁciently-prepared ‘plan that fea-
tured _thi's y-ear"s'draft registration,
Wo_rld_War I conscription came like
an unexpected bolt from the blue
to 1;he collegian of 1917. .

When the University student let
his classes in June of that year, his
only actual connection with the
armed forces of the United States
as a student was purely voluntary.
_There was on campus an organi-
zation known as the Pitt Drill club
whose purpose was to interest stu-
dents in military affairs. Although
there was no official connection be-
tween the University and the army,
student interest in the drill group
was high. Patriotic demonstrations,
rallies, and parades were designed
to stir up student enthusiasm.

When the student returned in
October, the conscription act adopt-
ct‘. Flurinrr "be mnnner Vvav. in force
and; -as a student of the University,
he was a member of the United
States army.

that the student will save--many

“The University was one of the
few schools in the country that did
not have regular army ofﬁcers to
drill its draftees,” the Weekly said.
“Therefore Dean Meller and assist-

The Gory Details

Suddenly he swore. “Get this over with,” he or-
dered himself. With sudden resolution he turned his
gun until the butt was in his hand. He thumbed back
the hammer, then hesitated and let it slowly down
again. Carefully, even tenderly, he carried the bat-
tered ugly thing over to the base of a nearby mesquite
tree and leaned it gently against the supporting trunk
of the tree.

He stepped back and braced himself, cocked his
gun, took careful aim, and squeezed the trigger. The
gun roared and jumped. Bill closed his eyes, prayer-
fully, for a long moment, then opened them and looked.

“Hot dog!” he shouted, “It worked!”

He ran over to the tree and picked up the object, its
top torn off by his bullet. As he raised the can of
tomatoes to his lips his eyes caught the little stained
patch of sand where the wasted juice had run‘ off.
Bill sighed. “Damned if I ever come off again with-

center and sharp cutting by the halfbacks.

As the snow continued

to fall on the steadily emptying stands and the soggy ﬁeld, it became

increasingly evident that the Pan-
thers were to beneﬁt by neither es-
sential. And when the halfbacks
had slipped for the last time and the
centers had made their last off-color
passes with an unmanageable ball,
a Fordham team that deserved no
better than a tie was headed back
to New York with a 24-12 victory.
The Panthers scored ﬁrst, played
the Rams-to a deadlock in the ﬁrst
period, and dominated the game
the entire second half, but Fordham
put over three touchdowns in a
weird second quarter, and that was
enough to win. Even with their
top-heavy halftime lead, the Rams
were forced to keep their ﬁrst team
backﬁeldpin action nearly the en-
tire afternoon, as Pitt savagely
fought back in an effort to atone
for their second period lapses.
Bert Kunkel, inexperienced re-
serve center, George Kracum, and
Bob Thurbon. were the unfortunate
goats, in Pitt’s,horrible 15 minutes.
Kunkel replaced Steve Sinco. after
Sinco was hurt in the ﬁrst quarter,
and started things by shooting the
ball over Thurbon,’s head on fourth
down. Thurbon recovered on the

RPit_t 15 but it was Fordham’s ball

and the brilliant Len Eshmont went
around right end to score on the
next play.

A few minutes a 15 yard holding
penalty shoved the Panthers back
to their own eight. Thurbon step-
ped behind the goal line to punt,
but big John Kuzman, Ram tackle,
broke through, blocked the kick,
and Santilli made the recovery for
the Rams on the Pitt three.
running plays failed to gain but a
third. with fullback Felipowicz
carrvine. paid off.

Shortly afterward Kracum fum-

‘bled on the Pitt 33 and Kuzman fell

on the ball. Vince Dennery made
13 yards on an end-around play,
and two plays later Eshmont cruis-
ed over from the 14.

Until the start of that quarter, the
Rams showed little that would have
made them favorites to trim the
Pittsburehers. Pitt opened the ball
game with a 65 yard touchdown
march on five plavs. It ware; Eddie
Jones for 13. Thurbon for one,
Thurbon for .15. Jones for one. and
.Tc.nes wide around right end for
34 yards and six points.

The Rams came right back after
the kickoﬁ’. Starting on their 32,
Eshmont. Felinowicz, and Jim Blu-
menstock took the Panther line
apart, Blumenstock crossing the

it has been said that a Pitt team can ’t get going on a wet-ﬁeld;
last Saturday adduional evidence that the saying should be an irre-
vocable fact was supplied on a snow-covered Stadiuin gridiron.

To be successful, the Pitt system rests on perfect passes from

Pitt-Fordlcam Sidelights

The snow party setting for Sat-
urday's ﬁeld hockey game provid-
ed the most miserable October play-
ing conditions in the ﬁfteen year’s
of Pitt Stadium history. That’s
the opinion advanced by veteran
press boxers, including Joe Dashei“,
announcer. who hasn’t missed a
game here since the bowl was open-
ed in 1925. Ironically enough, the
nearest comparison to the weather
was that of the Duke game of 1938,
in the heart of the sunny South!

Joe Rcttingei', senior right end
who cracked his leg in the SMU
battle and whose brother died of
an appendectomy last week, vis-
ited the Pitt dressing room after
the game to express his gratitude
for the wreath his_tedfr"i males had
sent to the funeral. “I surely ap-
preciate everyon'é’s kindness.”
he said, “particularly the fellows
on the squad.” Rettinger watched
Satu.rday’s contest from an. auto-
mobile parked just below the stu-
dent section.

Eleven New York district re-
porters kept open lines to the big
town, Bronx, and Newark papers.

‘ Among those present were Stan-

lev Woodward from the Herald
Tribune; Jack Smith, Daily News;
Lou Effrath, the Times; Tom

maker, Journal-A3merican,; Tim

Independents Mobilizing for Action;

Eight Teams Await Opening Whistle

While the fraternity touch foot-
ball teams stand idly by, waiting
for Thursday’s opening game, sev-
eral independent club iiewcomers
will get their ﬁrst taste of intra-
mural competition tomorrow on
Trees ﬁeld.

With eight teams comprising the
circuit, competition is expected to
be more closely contested than ever
before. Last year, with the Punks
leading the league, the independ-
ents won the all-intramural cham-
pionship for the ﬁrst time in sev-
eral years.

Although there was some talk
that the Punks might change their
name to the Continuity club, in
honor of the basketball system fath-
ered by the champs’ varsity coafch,
Dr. H. C. Carlson, manager Sam Mi-‘
lanovich vigorously denied the ru-
mor. Whether or not the Punks hon-
or him by switching monickiers it
is reported, that at the present time
Carlson is feeding his boys ice cream
in an effort to get them in shape for
the coming season. _

In the first game scheduled to-
morrow, the Cherokees will try to
cut down the invading P0litic‘al‘Sci-
ence team at 3 o’clock ‘on ﬁeld 1.

To Keep Cage

Vets on Move

Carlson Combines
Experience, Vigor

Sophomore prospects. enough to
melt the frown of any coach, have
provided the biggest problem thus
far in the practice sessions of Pitt’s
1940 basketball boys.

With five seniors capable of form-
ing one of the ﬁnest teams in recent
Pitt history, Doc Carlson’s squad
is amply stocked with experienced,
fast-breaking passers the kind
great teams are made of. And with
threef smart, sharp—shooting juniors
bidding for varsity berths, Pitt’s po-
tential ﬁrst ﬁve will be forced to
l.he limit.

Added fuel to the fire of competi-
tion for first team jobs is the spirit
and class shown by the 14 high-
powered sophomores. Tutored last
year by freshman coach Paul Zeh-
fuss, these boys have already de-
veloped a high degree of mastery
over the Pitt system.‘

Leaders of the sophomore drive
on the athletic “status quo” are
Bridgeville’s Tay Malarkey, all-
WPIAL performer and brother of
the Pitt football ﬂash a few years
ago; Scott high’s Swacus; Wilkins-
burg’s Masten; Carrick’s sawed-off
spark—plug Artman; , Central Cath-
o1ic’s husky Bill Lohmeyer; and
A1lderdice’s Silverman.

Homestead, perennial hotbed of
basketball, sends a smart young
man named Spartz, and from Ava-
lon and Schenley come Frazier and
Frey, two more excellent products
of last year’s freshman drilling.
Others in the running for varsity
recognition are_ Copetas, Lutz, Gold-
smith, Dolﬁ, and Capitans.

And while the ﬁghting sopho-
mores force the veterans to hustle
for their jobs, they are thoroughly
learning the Pitt system in the best
way it can be learned, through com-
petition with experts.

Seniors Straloski, Port, Milan-
ovich, Kocheran, and Klein still
form the nucleus of the squad, with
juniors Paffrath, Ziolkowski, and
Egan close behind. Egan is a protege
of ex—Pitt great Ted Roderick, now
coaching Claysville high. Lefty
Ziolkowski and Larry Paffrath are
athletes whose pitching shows best
on the basketball court.

Freshman Gritiders Prepriring
For Series of fitter-Squad Tilts

Rough work is on the menu for
freshman gridders this week as the
Panther cubs prepare for the series
of inter-squad games which start
within the next two weeks.

Coach Nick Kliskey is sufﬁciently
satisﬁed with the progress of his
boys to give them the chance to
show what they can do in actual
competition. The freshmen have
been fed a steady diet of blocking,
tackling, and drilling in the basic
plays of the Pitt system. Scrim-
mages have been rare but will in-
crease rapidly as the squad de-
velops.

Also on the schedule for the am-
bitious freshmen is a game with the
junior varsity. “Wild Bill”, Fitchko’s
“Milk Squad.” '

Though original plans called for
a three or four . team Freshman
league, only two teams will be
formed from the squad of 45. No
candidate has been cut from the
squad by the coaching staff, but the
terriﬁc pace set by boys like
Skladany. Scatton. and Durishan has
voluntarily forced out of the run-
ning 18 of the 63 men who re-
ported during the first week of
practice.

Depending on the progress made
by the squad, games will be held
frequently. possibly once a week.
Chief-of-staff Charley Bowser, anx-
ions to see just how sturdy a foun-
dation future Pitt teams will be
built on, has himself devoted con-
siderable attention to the freshman
