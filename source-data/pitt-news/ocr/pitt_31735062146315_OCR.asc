v The surviving members of the old _Eight

Infantry. will gladly testify to the_.‘gr_ea1;j.
merit of their. regimental "surgeon", Capt.‘
Charles S. Hendricks of the West 'Pe’nn'«Hos,-
pital, ‘formerly a football and baseballwsta‘

of one of ‘the leading citizens of Bolivar,» Pa.
Captain Hendricks has just received a short

line. action, 'which required physical stamina.
to a marked degree, as well :.1s*a"spirit of
bravery which won the admiration of the cour-
RKGOUS boys with whom he was associated.-‘ .
.After ﬁnishingup his course at Allegheny
College,’ where’ he starred on the diamond and
-the gridiron, young Hendricks entered the
medical department of the Uziiversity of Pitts-».
burgh and ﬁnished his "course. V ' ‘
he went as interne at the West Penn Hospital.‘
‘In the meantime, however, the new“doc'tor

i_m'e‘s,t,‘which hadits barracks in Oakland and

was " a part of the Pennsylvania ' National
Guar . . , ‘ e.  _ '
Hendricks’, course was ﬁnished when the

_Eighte'é.nth and other units of the Keystone
Guardwvere ordered to Camp’ Hancock.‘ That
was one year ago 'last September.
‘ ‘ Soon Gets Into Action. . _
The young physician hadsecured his ﬁnal
papers and went to camp-. In April of this
year the Twenty-eighth was ordered to France,
and what’ it has since» accomp!ish'ed,..surely
W011ld ﬁll many of the most illuminating
Pages of thejhistory of the world's war-. ' 
‘ The Keystone State ﬁghters had hardly got

both‘ the French. and American oliicers. They
Wei"? Sh°‘3k ,*-FOODS in, a true sense, and when
they ﬁnished their ' work around Chateau‘-
.Thie1-ry they ‘saw. more action in Belleau

mes. , I ..
‘ It was ‘at Fgisrnes where Captain Hendricks
suffered severely from gas attacks while at-
tending. the wounded dougliboys. When the .
went over the top he was with them an
naturally he"saw.war in its terrifying aspects.
The Pittsburgh physician found it necessary,
to use‘ his gas mask often, but despitethis
precautionary measure he was subjected to the
grave dangers of the suffocating waves. His‘
lnerve-racking grind’ of four days
| nights gidirig succor to the‘ wounded took place
rendered valiant service. , . . .
Other members of the~Keystone .Div_isio.n
have nothing but highest praise for the nervy
“physician who acted as much like a.-soldier"
as a healer of wounds. 7-low he came’ through
it all is remarkable, but he says he feels ﬁne
and eagerly, awaits his journey to Germany
