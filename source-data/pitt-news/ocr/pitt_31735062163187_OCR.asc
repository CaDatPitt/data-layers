Book Center ‘Plans -To Import

Foreign Wo1'l{s

At Low Prices

The University Book Center has made connedtions with
European publishing ﬁrms in order to bring foreign language
books and English books published in Great Britain to stu-

dents at lower costs.

Several shelves in the Fine Book Room already are ﬁlled
with French, Spanish and German paperbacks of both ﬁction

A
T

and non—ﬁction writing.

This new program of “import-
ing” literary material in its orig-
inal languageis being expanded to
include most modern languages.

Bypassing Fees

“In order to go ahead and fur-
nish students with books published
in England and other European
countries, we are exerting every
effort to_ establish business con-
tacts in the countries in which
those books are published,” said
-Paul Boltacz, manager of the _Book
Center. -

“By doingthi: we are bypass-
ing the costly brokerage fees
.that are normally an integral
part of the resale price,” he said.

After shipping, the resale price
is still only about ten per cent
more, whereas brokerage fees
caused the resale prices to soar to
three or four hundred percent of
the cost.

Prints. Sought

French writings already on the
shelves include Butor’s “Change
of Heart” in its original form “La
Modiﬁcation,” Natale Sarraute’s
“Portraits of an Unknown,” and
the Maigret detective story series
by Simenon.

‘Treatise on a Thesis

All students seiaking undergraduate degrees from the
‘University should be required to write a thesis in their

major ﬁeld.

  

This is a necessary move in raising theacademic
standards of the University. The preparation of a thesis
"would give a student the opportunity to creatively apply
the knowledge gained during his university experience.

A student might achieve imore directed study -in a ~
A A, speciﬁcarea of his major ﬁeld by writing a thesis. To write
’ at length on a subject requires a detailed knowledge of. that
subject, so students would have to begin thinking in.terms
of thesis writing early in their college careers.

Students who planato attend graduate school would
proﬁt immeasurably from such ,a program. They would, for
example, attain a ﬁrst—hand knowledge of primary source
materials. Furthermore, stimulation to enter graduate study
and continue work they have~"begun would be gained by

.. participants in this program. i A I i it

The preparation of la tliesisniwould instill in’ the student
a sense of accomplishment and would provide some tangible"
representation of his capabilities upon completion of one
‘phase of hiseducation. ‘

At present, students need‘ only maintain a certain Q.P.A.

, _ in order to receive their diplomas. Honors majors, who in

r - . many schools not only write theses but also take oral exams,

are required here to take’ six credits of work‘ which is
slightly more advanced than normal undergraduate work.’

should ﬁrst be introduced, and from there be extended to
the remaining students. , /

If this program were carried‘ out, a degree from the.
~University would be more valuable. Pitt would be follow-
ing the lead of the great universities in_ the country.

Students Must Wake Up

by Rodger D. Yeager ' ' V
The foreign affairs column originally intended
for this, week’s Pitt News was a critique of _per-
sonal diplomacy in U. S. foreign policy. In pre-
paring the article, I found it necessary to inter-
view students concerning, their own views on
personal diplomacy. I .,. A
Because-,of their answers, the column this week
will. not be a critique of per— '
sonal diplomacy, but a critique
of’ the lack of student knowledge
of foreign affairs.
All of the‘ students inter-
viewed had no personal under-
standing of perhaps one of the '_
most'controversial and import-
ant aspects of recent American
diplomacy. E p_
Believe it or not chums, 
knowledge offoreign affairs is"
much more important today than
knowledge of the

games. -
In Delicate "Balance

In a time when an event in Pakistan could seal

the fate of the entire world’s population, ‘an’ under-
standing of United States and world political

movements is essential to every American citizen_

with an I.Q. of over eighty.
There is‘.no reason, then, "for the students of a
university to be uninformed on happenings today

.'which will certainly affect their role as the intel-

lectual leaders of tomorrow.

Our opponents in the Cold War would like
nothing better than to see American college youth

reduced, in its extracurricular intellectual interests

to playing cards or watching baseball games.

If we like it or not, we as college students have
a deﬁnite rolevto play. We will be the leaders in
business, in the professions, in poli.tics.
then, will we learn to assume the responsibility of
leadership, the responsibility of being well "in-

formed? Are the college years too early to work ‘i

to understand the movements of the world and
the United States’ relationship to these move-
ments? I think not. A .
It is time that we begin to take an exampl
from the students of the other free countries‘ of
the world. These students have political views,
and they make well known these views. They con-

sequently possess a place of leadership in their .

societies, a place which enables them to play a
vital part in the policy of making of the societies.

Despite the limitations of a cramped stage, Dr. John H.

Ulrich, director of the group an

’ the talents of the players with

Dr. Kalmin Burnim, assistant0
professor ‘of speech, had the lead
role of Joe Keller, and he ‘more
than measured up_ to the standards
needed for his demanding part. ‘Dr.
Burnim-made Joe Keller not only
act. like a “regular” (another
George Babbitt), but also made
him look and seem like this type
of person.

Chris Keller,’ Joe’s son, was su-.
perbhy portrayed by Barry Cun-
ningham. Chris appeared‘ as a
clean-cut, idealistic young man,
a man who was »a little bit above
the low motives of the world. He
could be called another Billy
Budd. Cunningham looked and
acted precisely as he should.

Ruth Beall takes the honors

for turning in the most con-
vincing performance. As Kate
Keller, Joe’s wife, she needed
to be motherly, reactive, and
overwraught at the same time.
She wasaevery bit the versatile
actress necessary to persuade
the audience to acecpt Kate as
a consistent character.
. Jay Lermanv, who gets better in
each play that he acts in, created
a deﬁnte feeling toward the per-
sonality of Dr. Jim Bayliss. Ler-
man, appearing as a neighbor
doctor, had to give strength to
the meaning of the play.

Bill Bowers, comedy star of
the Pitt Players’ “Pajama Game,”
tried his hand at some serious
drama in the minor role of George
Deever. Bowers, who seems to
have a command over the‘ stage,
was successful in this endeavor,
and probably will be in whatever
he does in the future in show bus-
iness. ‘

‘The Leopard’ by Guiseppe Lampedusa

Italian Author Pens
Fictional Best-Seller

By ALVIN M. RESNICK
“The Leopard” by Guiseppe di Lampedusa is historical
ﬁction which resembles orange—ﬁavored aspirin. The med-
icine’s still in the middle, but here’s a book that makes the
reader enjoying swallowing. This novel containsﬂa mixture

‘of Garibaldian-era history of

Sicily and the effects of this

history upon the long—established feudal class of that time.

‘Both the history and ﬁctional¢

biography presented in the book
can be appreciated on their own
merits, for neither the authenticity
nor the biographical art is com‘-
prised for the sake of the other.
The result is'an intricate interde-
pendence of the two individual
elements.

The’ book begins when Gari-
baldi, on his way to overthrow the
Bourbon monarchy in Naples,
lands in Sicily, and the power is
transferred from the feudal» lords
to the bourgeoisie.

Both Biography and History

This history ‘forms a great po-
litical conflict against which the

’ Sicilian personalities are revealed.

‘The realistic biography, on the
other hand, which shows the ef-
fects of this change upon the
hoblemen, brings history down to‘
the personal level where it is best
understood. Interwoven as they
ar‘e7by Lampedusa, these two ele-

T Cments form an excellent novel..

-Don Fabrizio, the proud but
philosophical Prince of Salina,
is called “the leopard” because
of the animal which appears on
his family coat of arms. With‘.
the coming of Garibaldi and the
decline of feudal authority,

"Fabrizio is faced with the con-

ﬂict of past traditions and pres-.

. ‘ ent alliances.

- His beloved, charming nephew,
Tancredi, M joins the “Garibaldini”
and even asks his uncle’s help in
securing the hand of Angelica,
beautiful daughter of the newly-
wealthy middle class ‘Mayor of
Donnafugata. -
‘Contemplates Stars:
Fabrizio, realizing the truth of

A'Tal‘1credi’s “ ‘If we want things to

stay" as they ‘are, things. will have

' . to change ”"acquiesces to the new

regime but seeks‘ solace in con-
templating the stars.

“The Leopard” shows symbol-

" ically the three factions accom- '

panying all major political
changes. Tancredi is representa-
tive of those enthusiastic for a
political change. Rabrizio is the
reluctant one who gives in but '
who hopes that things will re-
.turn to “normal.” ‘ ‘

Father Plrrone, the Salinas’

'priest, represents the unalterable

force. He realizes the new regime

.will conﬁscate the Church’s prop-

erty, and he stands vehemently
against the change. ‘
Shows Declines of Prince_

This book is a series of related
episodes which illustrate th e
gradual decline of Don. Fabrizio,
the ‘last Prince of Salina. It de-
scribes the" life of transient plea-

and telescopes might have exposed
him to the risk of being outlaw-
ed.” I

The language of the book is
one _of very clear imagery as
seen _in. the thoughts" of Don
Fabrizio: “He had found himself
comparing this ghastly journey’
with his own life, ,which had
ﬁrst moved over smiling level
ground, then clambered up
rock mountains, slid over threat-
ening passes, to emerge event-
ually into a landscape of inter-
minable undulations, all of the
same color, all bare as despair.”

A minor" analogy which runs
throughout the book is the fluc-
tuation of the weather concurrent
with the fluctuation of Fabrizio’s
fortunes. ,

The ﬁnal mood of the story is
one of mild iron in which Fa-
brizio’s daughter, Concetta, an
old maid, discovers that she has
been bitterly harboring "a mis-
conception about Hancredi for
50 years. A V‘

This suggests an appraisal of
life in which the transient values
we hold ' as sacred, and upon
which we base. most of our ac-

tions, we are’ seen as worthless.
The demise of the Salinas signiﬁes
the demise of an era and of some

of these worthless values.

Pulitzer Prize Winner Speaks A

On Motivation, Misconceptions
. I By TRUDY WEISS

The world of the poet, according to 1959 Pulitzer Prize
winning poet Stanley J. Kunitz, includes “just about every-
thing.”.Mr. Kunitz discussed poetry and the world of the poet
at the Midday series last week. ' ’

“There are a good many misconceptions about poetry,”
said Kunitz. “Its function is not to make us good, just com-

passionate, or noble.”, In his: .

clock. The re_lationship of-the
poet to society is, frequently
misunderstood, because most
people think poets stand apart
from society deliberately. This,
however, is not so‘: poets are
very much involved, according
to Mr. Kunitz.

“It is the business of the poet"
to know everything, to beahead
of the people.” And the poet must
have his opinions.

He is revolutionary, ~yet con-
servative. He is “not the legislator,
but the catalyst.” In other words,
the poet does not rule or com-
mand but he causes. the legsla-
tion to come into being.

As the treasurer,‘ the job of
the poet is to preserve those as-
pects of society worth preserv-
ing.

In a physical sense, poetry is
a collection of words, not ideas in
themselves, Mr. Kunitz pointed
out. But they must serve to evoke
ideas and feelings.

Mr. Kunitz, winner of a Ford
Fellowship in poetry in 1959, has
published “Selected Poems 1928-
1958” in 1958. He is presently
