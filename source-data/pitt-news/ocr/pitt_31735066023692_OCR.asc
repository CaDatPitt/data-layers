hold them for a concentrated period

trate on their reason for being there
without distractions,” Smith said.
The retreat was paid through
SGB’s general account, which is
funded by student activities fees,
and covered room and board for the
23 student government members
and 3 facilitators who attended, and
a $200 stipend each for Dr. Nancy
Elman and Ron Joubert, from the

would probably, have made more
mistakes and wasted a lot more
money on programs that didn’t

City water ' department crews
worked seven hours ‘Tuesday
repairing a water line break affecting
some residents in Squirrel Hill, Point
Breeze, Shadyside and Oakland.

“We had a 12-inch cast iron water
line break on Dithridge Street near
Bayard sometime between midnight
and 6 a.m.” John Stahoviak, super-
intendent of the distribution division
of the city water department said.
He added there may have been a
few hundred residences without
water while the rest were on low
service, who were not completely
without water,_but had low water
pressure.

During the afternoon, water was
rerouted and carried to the affected
areas through a 20-inch transmis-

. sion line, Stahoviak said.

The salt crews were called
because the water running down the
streets of Craig and Bayard caused
slippy roads, he said.

“The trouble with salting when
you have a leak is that the water will
wash away the salt. So as soon as
we got the water offlthe streets, the
crews salted,” Stahoviak explained.

Brinkley’s Day ii Gut Now
yed for Appeal

By CHRIS CLINTON

Pitt News Staff Writer

Developments have occurred to
temporarily halt the trail_ of con-
victed murderer Sidney Brinkley.
Judge Ralph J. Cappy, of Allegheny
County Common Pleas Court,
ruled yesterday that the defense has
no standing at this time to raise the
issue of the constitutionality of the
death penalty.

Brinkley has been charged with
first degree murdervand the death
penalty if found guilty in the 1979
slaying of Pitt student Monica
Jones. Jury selection" was to begin
yesterday.

Brinkley’s. attorney, John R.
Cook, called the death penalty
"cruel and unusual punishment and

in violation of due process” a d
, n

director of student activities, who
I was also a facilitator at the seminars.
“We dealt with the immediate
problems in student government
andgdiscussed our alternatives for
handling them,’7 SGB member Todd
DeLuca said. Instead of having auto-

nomous groups who periodically,

‘report to SGB, we decided to hold
monthly planning sessions that will
be attended by everyone, SGB, the
Allocations Committee, and the
Chairpersons of the standing com-
mittees. That way, decisions will be
made by student government as a
whole.” _ , ' ~ '

SGB is also considering holding a

asked Cappy to rule it unconstitu-
tional. Cappy ruled that the consti-
tutionality of the death penalty
cannot be challenged until _it is
imposed.

Cappy did grant, however, a peti-
tion for allowance of appeal if the
defense decides to appeal, the final
decision on'standing will be made by
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
Until that decision is made, the trial
is at a standstill. \

Brinkley was ‘convicted of two
first degree murder charges, and
one second degree murder charge,
in three separate 1979 murders in
Philadelphia. He was sentenced to
two life terms for the first degree
murders. Philadelphia prosecutors
tried to impose the death penalty in
both murders and failed. '

Two Pitt campus police rookies
have received awards for outstand-
ing achievement in the areas of aca-
demics and physical fitness.
Michael Edwards, a graduate of

if Indiana University, received the

John B. Stack award for academic
achievement and Curtis Smith, a
Pitt Graduate, won the.Outstanding
Physical Fitness award.

Niether of the recruits have ‘yet
made arrests, but both are satisfied
with their jobs with the Pitt police. ‘-

Edwards has been on the force
since December and said that he is
still learning his way around Pitt.

Before taking the police training
course at the North Park Police
Academy, Edwards said he was a
military policeman in the Army,
serving as a police investigator.

He said he went into policework
after a stint in a retail management
because "management was just a
job. It wasn't really a career."

Edwards studied federal and state

"law, crime nd traffic codes and

crime scene investigations at the
Academy. He achieved a 95.9 aver-
age out of a possible 100, which led
to'his receiving the Stack award:
"It was quite an honor. It means a
lot to me. personally. There's a per-

--Waterline Break    

"Officer William O'Rourke of the
Pittsburgh Police said there were
few traffic problems in Oaklandcon-
sidering the situation.

“We had to tow two cars from the
areaso that the crews could dig,”‘
O’Rourke said‘.

' Closing Dithridge Street may
have affected people who use it _for

sonal pride in getting an award,"
Edwards said. "I've always wanted
to be a policeman. I love it a lot,” he
added.

He said-that he liked the investiga-
tive aspect’ of police work in the
Army as well as his job at Pitt,
though he had a few comments
about starting as a rookie. "Starting
at the bottom is tough. You just
kind of take it with a grain of salt,
keep smiling, and wait for your day
to come," Edwards said. "There
seems to be a really, good rapport
between the students and the police
officers. I think that a cop can be’a
nice guy and still get the job done. I
really see noreason to be a hard-
ass." ,

Edwards said he is ‘not certain
what his aspirations will be but
desires to remain in law enforce-
ment and added that he likes Pitt.

”I like the way its layed out. lcan
kind of look at it through the stu-
dents’ eyes, through the staff's eyes,
I like what I see here," he said.

Curtis Smith, another rookie and
a history-black studies graduate of
Pitt, received the Outstanding Phys-
ical Fitness Award. '

. Before _working for Pitt, Smith
worked for the Board of Education
in Pittsburgh, dealing with juveniles
as a counselor. He said he dealt with.

The Black Graduate and Profes-

in a joint effort with the Black Action
Society will sponsor memorial servi-

and the Public Health Building. Clif~
ford Charles, president of the
BGPSC, said the goal to make the
birthdayof the civil rights leader,
January 15, a national holiday is only
part of a larger goal.

“We want to emphasize that this

the consciousness of our nation,”

Htt Scientists FindSmaIIerAmounts of Drugs More Effective  

By MIKE MALLINGER

Pitt News Staff Writer

Two University of Pittsburgh
scientists have discovered that
smaller amounts of antidepressants
and electroshock are as effective as
larger doses of drugs and
electroshock. '

Louis A. Chiodo and Seymour

‘M’. Antelman have shown» that

-5.,

‘\l

smaller drug doses produce the same '

effect as those" measures-adminiso-'
tered over the’ long. term. ’ ‘

Scientists are not sure what brain-
changes cause depression.

“All we know clinically is that,

these drugs work. ~ We don’t know
why they work. The theory is that if

morating Dr. King will . be held
Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Heinz
Chapel, and a second program,
“The Life of a King”, will begin at 8
p.m. in the Public Health Building,
according to Charles.

“While the Black Caucus has con-
ceived the idea for “A Life ofa King”
program, BAS, the Black Studies
Department and the University
Community Education Program
were all helpful throughout,” Cha-
rles added. '

Mona" Riscoe, chairperson of '~

BAS, said they will bring Broadway
actress Binnie Burrows to_Pitt today
in the Lower Lounge to honor Dr.
King. A

“Burrows does an historical pers-
pective of black struggles from time
of Harriet Tubman up to. 1974,” Ris-
coe said.

In addition, BAS is sponsoring a
round trip bus to Washington, D.C.

. for students and staff interested in

we know why they work we will
begin to understand what ‘depres-

' sion is," Chiodo said.

Tricyclics affect brain cells called
neurons which produce dopamine.
In depressed patients neurons are
thought to produce too much
dopamine and.«tricyclics make the
neuron less receptive; to dopamine.

_i_,Chiodo and Antelman ﬁnd that '
dopamine‘ production does not cut".-. -

itself off in depressedlepatients. '

“its a? self-braking , mechanism.
It's possible that depressionis over-
regulation. It’s too much of a
break,” Chiodo said.

The two.P.itt scientists have found

participating in the National March
on the Capitol, in lobbying effort to

imake January 15 Martin Luther

King, Jr. Day, Riscoe said.“

“Our bus will leave early on
Thursday and return at 8:00.”

“About eight buses will be going
from the Pittsburgh area,” she said.

Rock singer Stevie Wonder, who
organized the march, and several
national speakers will be at the rally,
Riscoe added. She -said it is

expected to draw some 500,000‘

‘people from around the country.

Petitions, also, to support
national recognition of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. Day will be taken to
Washington and presented to Con-
gress, Riscoe said. According to the
petition, this holiday “would reflect
the finest moral character, ideals
and leadership for which Dr. King
gave his life." i

that continued electroshocks are not

necessary. Also, it is not necessary _

to load up the patients with drugs for
a month to treat depression.

“What youhave to do is start it up
with a little bit of ECS or tricyclic
and just wait the four week’ period ’
Chiodo said.

Electroshock is among the more
effective means of treating world

— depression, Chiodo added.-

Though the patientslarejanesthet.-S

 ized. bones can break during"convul-
' .sions caused by ‘electroshock and

memory disruptions are common.

There is a strong social stigma at-
ached to electroshock which “Is sad
because electroconvulsive shock is

the most effective‘ anti—depressant
treatment we have,” ‘Chiodo said.
Chiodo added that-once scientists
thought that drugs would not work
on neurons and they did not exam-
ine the autoreceptor, a part of the
«neuron that receives dopamine.
Antelman and Chiodo were the first

to examine the dopamine receiving‘

autoreceptor.

“It may be t’oo~"inhibitor'y in the
depressed patient. They may .be'1-oo

By COLLEEN MCDONALD

The last of Ed Stemberg’s Sinai
desert tan has faded. He no longer
drinks up to five gallons of liquid per

day. Nor does he rise at five o’clock _

in’ the morning to breakfast on let-
tuce, cucumbers and tomatoes.
Stemberg, the recipient of the
Nationality vProgram’s I980 Israel
Room Scholarship, has a bit- of
advice for those thinking of applying
for scholarships to study abroad this
summer. ~

_As part of the American Zionist
Youth Federation, a group of Amer-
icanswho visited Israel last‘ summer,
Stemberg said that he could not
have asked for a more educational,
social and cultural experience.

"Be prepared to walk and take '

lots of T-shirts and shorts," said
Stemberg, a senior economics
major. ”Israel is .about the size of
New Jersey. They have the highest

OK/-P)’ CLASS, THAT'S
IT FOR foo/3y.

inﬂation in the world, 150%, and they
tend to think that all Americans are
rich.”

. The temperature" ranges from 85
to H0 degrees Stemberg said. "The
kind of air I was breathing was like
the air coming out of a hair dryer,"
he said. "We travelled by bus
between cities and then spent about
six to eight_hours walking each day."

Stemberg said that he got used to
seeing men in uniform and carrying
guns in thestreets. In Achziv, near
the Lebanese border, he said he felt

protected with the amount of

patrols, armored tanks and out-
posts dotting the roads. " '

"Service in the military is manda-
tory for both men and women, he
said. _

’’The men enter the army for‘
training at the age of IS and they
continue to serve intermittently
until, the ages of 55 or 60."

During the six»-weeks Stemberg
spent in Israel, his group visited
Hebrew University for a,-week.
Stemberg conducted an independ-
ent study there on the tourist indus-
try, life in a Kibbutz (a communal
settlement), and compared Hebrew,

University with ~Ame.rican;‘

universities. , ’ _.’-

"I was impressed with thequality
of education, the dorm living and
overall campus of Hebrew Univer-

sity," said Sternberg. ''It was not
' unlike Penn State or Pitt."

The cost of living fascinated
Sternberg, especially when he was
in the Arab market. '

"We had baseball caps that were
being exchanged . for 40 dollar
wooden backgammon sets," he
said. ’_'lf‘-If had knowrithat-ln‘Iew York

Yankee caps were in such a demand

I would have. taken a whole

suitcase." '

' Gasoline was another shocker.
”A gallon of gas is about four dol-

lars, yet bus fares were as low as 18

cents," added Stemberg.
I-\t tne end of his stay in Israel,

Stemberg, along with his group,
made a five day bus trek through the
Sinai Dessert. Contrary to popular
belief, the desert is not always dry.
There are numerous‘ lakes. 'Ster'n-
berg even braved the Dead Sea,
where no fish or plant can survive. ._

By the middle of August, Stern-
berg -said he was ready to return to
the States and have a good home-
cooked meal.

"The food was not all that good.
_Whenever we could we tried to find
bakeries and fast food joints. In the
desert we ate'a lot of fruits,.vegeta-
bles and soups," he said. ”But occa-
sionally, our guide allowed us
spaghetti cooked over an open fire."

As far as a language barrier,
Stemberg said that most ‘people
speak English. And although he has
reading knowledge of Hebrew, he

03.‘

‘said he spoke little Hebrew while in _ 1

Israel. ' y
"The study abroad was in first for
me. Had it not been for Rabbi Joe
Levine, (of B’nai B’rith Hillel) I prob-
ably,wouldn’t have known about the
Nationality Rooms Program,=Scho-
larship. This was the first year for
the Israel Room Scholarship," said’
Stemberg. - ’ - ‘ ,

When asked whether ornot he. ,

would ever go back to Israel, Stern-

; berg said another visit would be fine.

But despite the marvelous tan,
desert life is not for him.

G. Gordon Liddy told a Pitt audience Sunday that
Americans live in a world of illusions. '
The convicted Watergate burglar may be correct;

-members of the audience could not help but be
-A impressed with him. Liddy had also been received

enthusiastically at othercolleges and universities.

“Throughout the lecture he wins his audience over
and then at the end he gets a standing ovation,” said
Brian Winthrop, Liddy’s Agent.

That can be very scary, and very dangerous.

We welcome the opportunity to hear Liddy speak,

    

'3 of

since he played a key role in the national rt.-gii:
Watergate.

Butthe danger lies in the possibility audiences are
so overwhelmed by Liddy’s effective speaking style
and sharp wit they fail to recall his part in‘Watergate or
comprehend his philosophies. '

Liddy is a man who wanted to kill columnist Jack
Anderson, believing it would have been justified and in
the national interest.

In 1971 Liddy authored a plan that included: kidnap-
ping Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, drugging them,

and holding them in Mexico until the 1972 Republican . '

National Convention was over; renting a yacht near
the site of the ’72 Democratic convention, hiring pros-
titutes to lure Democratics on it, then photographing
them; and bugging the private hotel rooms of promi-
nent Democrats during the convention.

Liddy ‘broke into Daniel Ellsberg’s office, hoping to
view his personal files.

Finally, Liddy and others illegally entered the head- -
“ quarters of the Democratic party three times, placing

 

 

Page 8—Wednesday, January 14, 1981 I

wiretaps on phones and photographing files.

But ourmemory of Watergate seems to have faded
considerably. Liddy’s illegal actions and warped sense
of patriotism were not the focus of questions asked by
the audience following the speech. Liddy was ques-
tioned on almost every subject except Watergate.
Instead, people questioned his views on the hostage
situation, ' the 1960’s, and John Lennon’s
assassination. _ I

Liddy stated he is not penitent and does not believe

his actions were wrong. He justifies them by claiming

such actionseithero happened in all campaigns,~or
were in the national interest. ‘

It is wrong to ‘accept Liddy’s simplistic answers and
shallow reasoning. Watergate was a national embar-
rassment," something that cannot be justified or
excused. - ' -

It is easy to forget this while listening to Liddy. After
all, G. Gordon Liddy is well educated, articulate, and
intelligent. A s

G. Gordon Liddy is also a convicted felon.

By MARK COLLINS

These are inflationary times.
Being a senior—and awaiting the
formal notice of my unemployment
in April——I feel some responsibility
to warn freshman and sophomores
about choosing a major.
Remember when your parents
said, “Go to College and get a good
job—whaddya, wanna do, be a
plumber for the rest of your life?”
Well, like McCarthy and‘thalidom-
ide, your parents were wrong. If you
have any ‘ability in plumbing or any
other mindless technical field, quit
school and stop spending money.
This little deke around reality will

‘ increase your assets and decrease

expenditures: one of the niftiest of
all economic laws.

If, however, you insist on educa-
tion, refer to the table below.
ANTHROPOLOGY: The study of
ancient history was shown to be
useless by the ancients. Heed their
advice. If you really love the subject,

- buy cheap backpacks and bandanas

and work only on local archeological
digs—say, McKee street.

ART: Quit school and move to
Shadyside.

 BLACK STUDIES: No way—not
s during a Republican administration.

Also, going to college means giving
up a mental job. Remember that the

S" . job will be given to an unemployed

Ph.D. That’s the breaks. .

IBIOLOGIY: Get ,into genetic ‘

staph, Burger Chef. A virtual eco-
nomic boon.

CHEMISTRY: Be forewarned.
Medical costs for treating acid burns
have doubled in the past ten years—'
and the Chem building is built like a

bomb shelter for a reason. But most
Chemists find a good job—and save '

a bundle synthesizing their.recrea-
tional drugs at home. Good choice.
COMP SCI: IF (PATIENCE .GT.
SAINT) THEN PLUG IN AT 24
THOU/-YR IF NOT, PASS-
WORD=“CHEAT FOR GRADE”
ENDIF. '

ECONOMICS: With‘ the Primal
Incest Rape over 20 percent, you
might get a job—but no one is going
to talk to you. Ever. I sure won't,
you cut-throat thugs. I hope the
market crashes and your Mom
takes the plunge from the 14th ﬂoor.
ENGINEERING: Life might seem
good, but take out a lot of insurance.

Oh sure——27 grand per annum is
wonderful, but the same wonder-
boys who gave us Fallingwater also
gave us TM] and Langley Hall. And
they could put a brick to sleep,
they’re that boring. And they all

GEOLOGY/GEOGRAPHY: Same

The January 11 program consis-
ting of questions to G. Gordon

Liddy subsequent to his well--

practiced and rehearsed routine
was certainly educational.

A good many people saw and
heard up close a principal ﬁgure
from out of the crime-infested days
of the truncated Presidency of
Nixon and were thus able to make
some kind of judgement as to the

« caliber of mentality which perm-
_\ eated the most felonious Pres-
-rifidency in our short national history.

The remarkable effectiveness of
Liddy as performer/ speaker is due
in great measure to his incorpora-

tion of comedy into the presenta- «

_“AWe|| -Reheasedﬂoiuline”

tion of his hate-ﬁlled philosophy.
Through comedy he creates the

conditions to craftily disarm folks

as to the grave danger his brand of
thinking represents to the internal
security of our nation: follow
blindly the orders of your superior.

One of Mr. Liddy’s slimier
tactics is to talk about how he
looked around during the sixties
and as a result of what he saw, he
got political, ran for Congress and
lostpbecame a prosecutor, and then
joined the Nixon Gang in early 1969
at the Treasury Department. 1

The only difﬁculty with his
chronological grouping of events is
the fact that some of the major
events he cites as impelling him to

action in the 605 did not occur until
the 70’S.llll

In particular, he mentioned the

-Army Math Building explosion

which didn't occur until August’

1970, the bombing of “your”
capitol which didn't occur until
March 1, 1971, and the bombing of
the Pentagon, which occurred ‘in

Pitt Beats Eastern

it Panther Offense Comes

Alive to Win Game 80-56

, BY AMIN GHOSSEIN

- Pitt News Sports Writer
Fickle. That’s the Pitt basketball
team. Two days ago, many were
‘ lamenting about Pitt’s lack of shoot-
ing and failure to do much of any-
thing on offense. Just when
everything seemed to be going
wrong, the Panthers came up with a
performance that makes one

‘ wonder which is the true team.

lt’s a shame that the two best per-
formances by Pitt have come on the
road. Earlier in the year they dis-
mantled a good St. Bonaventure
team on the road. On Monday, the

Panthers totally annihilated Eastern
Kentucky 80-56.
Actually, Pitt camejintojthe game
"with one strategy that it had not
enforced in recent games: use Sam
Clancy.

The logic behind this is obvious.
Since the team is mired in a shooting
slump, Chipman decided to go to his

Eastern Kentucky is just starting a
program of major college propor-

tion and is not considered to be in
Pitt’s class. ‘

bread and butter to hopefully try to
regain some of that confidence that
Pitt so desperately needed. It just
might have worked. '

“We wanted Sam to get the ball
more and to shoot more. He must
have taken at least five fifteen-
footers,” ‘ said Chipman after the
game. . . ’

The senior All-America candidate
responded with a season high of 25
points and led an all-round team per-
formance. Carlton Neverson con-
tributed 14 points and Dwayne
Wallace countered with seven but
was much more valuable due to the
fact that he handled a game-long ful-
lcourt p fact that he handled a
game-long full-court press with no
difficulty. ' ,

Lennie McMillan had another
steady performance with 12 points.
The Pitt offense was able to be so
effecti8ve because the defense did

effective because the defense did '

what it did in the St. Bonaventure
game? create opportunities. Due toj
turnovers, the Panthers were able
to create fastbreaks and easy
buckets. Roy Chipman knew his
1-3-1“ defense might give some trou-
ble to Eastern Kentucky.

“Reggie Warfard, our assistant
coach scouted them and came to
the conclusion that our zone would
give them trouble because they wer
give them trouble because they wer-
en’t a good passing team,” said
Chipman.l The transformation
was so complete that in the first half
of the Rutgers game, Pitt shot a poor
29 percent while in Monday's
second half they shot an incredible
73 percent from the floor. Will the
real Pitt Panthers please stand up?

Eagle CoachLooksi 
Ah-eadto Super   jwl

by Colleen McDonald

‘PHILADELPHIA-Will the ‘Philadel-
phia Eagles be -able to enjoy their
first trip to. the Super, Bowl?

“There is only one way to enjoy a
football game and that’s to win,”
said Eagles’ coach Dick Vermeil.

“And I’ve only been in this kind of
situation one other ‘time and‘ that
was the Rose Bowl,” Vermeil added.

Vermeil’s UCLA team upset Ohio
State in the 1976 Rose Bowl, ’less
than two months before he took the
Eagles’ head coaching job. '

Vermeil recalled .this week that

his Rose Bowl team almost had a I

walkout before the game.

“They thought I was crazy the

way we were preparing for the foot-
ball game,” Vermeil said. “But that’s

my responsibility, to prepare them '

to win. The only way you can have a-
good time is to win.

celebration, champagne. Hey, you '

have a‘ guarantee_,of'being back here
next year, because all ‘four teams
who played in the conference c-ham-,

pionship games a year ago-didn’t
~ play in them thisyear. So,if, you get

that opportunity, you better take
advantage of it,” Vermeil said. ,

Vermeil added, however, that the

Eagles will enjoy going to the Super‘ ‘

Bowl. He said there was no ques-

A tion about that in his.mind.

_‘‘But we willgo down the re for one
reason. That's to play the best ‘of
our ability, and we’ll play bétterthan
we did in beating Dallas for the NF
title,” Vermeiljdeclared.’ *

The Eagles dominated the Cow-
boys Sunday in a 20-7 victory that
carried them into the Super Bowl
against the Oakland Raiders in -New
Orleans’ Superdome, Jan. 25.

Panther Swimmers Meet Penn State at Home

‘ By SEAN BARNES
Pin News Staff Writer

The Panther swim team open the
second half of their home season
against the high ranking Penn State
Nittany Lions this Saturday at Trees
Pool. The men from Pitt swim at
Duquesne on Friday evening in a
meet that they should be favored to
win. Pitt head coach Fred Lewis
looks forward to the Penn State
meet, with apprehension due to the
effect of the long practices the team
had over the Christmas holidays
down in sunny San Juan, Puerto

Rico.

The Panthers put in 10 tough days
of workouts down south in the well-
equipped Pan Am pool. It was there
that the Pitt men put in an average of
10 miles a day swimming plus many

hours of weight training. Lewis says

   

it was the best practices the men
had in six years.

“We are a faster, tighter, and
higher quality team than what left
for Puerto Rico three weeks ago,”
said Lewis. “Our best got even
better.” ,

Pitt already proved this by their
dicisive victory, while still in Puerto
Rico, over West Point, 59-27. The

meet was held after a tough day of
practice for the Panthers.

“We got done what we wanted
accomplished,” said Lewis, “since
we had very few distractions.”

Lewis was disappointed,
however, due to the temporary loss
of freshman
Geoff Emores who recieved stitches
for a blow on the head when he trip-
ped in his room. So Pitt will swimm
without their starting backstroker
this Saturday. Also hurting Pitt will

AMAZING  
mew CANCER
ORATION

be the ailing elbow of long distance
swimmer Mike Polak. Yet Pitt is a
deep team. the Panthers will enter
the meet with nationally—ranked
breaststroker Sandy Pidgeon and
400 free-relay team composed of
Jerry Zaleski, Scott Shearer, John
McCrillis and Rick Carter. Lewis is
looking forward to some outstand-
ing times from his sprinters and an
overall high caliber showing from all
his swimmers.

Pitt diving coach Junan Krug is
looking for a very competitive men’s

diving portion of the meet. Diving
for Pitt for the first time will be Mike
Minnich. This is Minnich’s first real
meet in a year, yet Krug is looking
for very relaxed and strongdiving
from him. Diving for Penn State will
be Craig Brown, Joe,Greenwell, and
two new freshmen. Both Brown and
Greenwell looked beatable at the
Penn State Relays so Krug is looking
to see Pat Greenwell, for Pitt, beat
his younger brother Joe as well as
Craig Brown. Also diving for Pitt will
be Bob Lambert.

“Bob (Lambert) and Mike

(Minnich) have been training
heavily, not so much for jthis meet,
but for Nationals in March,” Krug
said. “We may not be at our ~
sharpest since the workouts the
past couple wee3ks have been so
hard, but you’ll see it pay off when
Nationals come around.” V

The entire Pitt swim team and
coaching staff look forward to
seeing Pitt students turn out to see
the Panthers swim and dive against
arch-rival Penn State. The men’s
meet will begin at 4 p.m. Saturday at
Trees Pool.

Pantherette Pam Miklasevich (on bottom) fights an opponent for the ball
A during a recent home game. It has been this kind of hustling play that has
kept Pitt, 1 1-3, a leading contender for the Eastern title. The next game is
today in West Virginia.. '
