P-ittsburgh’s anti-smoke campaign is well under way. It
has already effected large—scale operations in private industry,
homes, and public utilities. Here at Pitt, too, a smoke abate-
ment campaignis being conducted——only on a slightly smaller
scale.

In our drive, the vast laboring class will not suffer if, for
success, the campaign is enforced, nor will capittalists lose if
it is a. failure. V
V The Pitt plan merely calls for co-operation and observance
of an “0ut—0f-bounds” regulation, limiting cigarette-smoking
to certain areas. Mr. TVilliam Daufenbacli and his student staff
constitute the marshaling force; the faculty and entire body
represent Pitt citizenry. Because we are not law-breakers, out
of consideration for non-smokers, and because there are num-
erous areas where smoking is permitted We would like to join
Mr. Daufenbach in his appeal for observance of University

' smoking regulations. ‘

 V peace

The need for more and better educational facilities at Pitt
provides a constant subject for debate among students. Faculty
and student committees meet frequently to iron out the major
and minor difficulties that arise in our complex university life.
But basically, we are forgetting that: ﬁrst, we are physically
able to be a. part -of the student body, and second, there is
a place where we can organize, meet, and attend classes.

These simple things which we take for granted are far
from true in the war devastated countries of Europe. There
is a movement on campus this week seeking contributions" for
the rehabilitation of schools and students abroad. This orga-

'nization, World Student Service Fund, is striving to aid these

broken schools and disheartened students. The need for funds
is more dire than any of us can realize. Complete schools, in-
cluding some of Europes ﬁnesft medical laboratories, now. lie
"in broken heaps———a symbol of the ruined. Tuberculosis is on
the rampage through the stricken countries, plagueing the
humble ,attempts of the students in their struggle for edu-
cation-
Europe is not asking for this aid—We are offering it
to them. Strong bonds of fellowship must exist between
the contemporary students of today. This is a prime re-
quisite for the “Design for Peace.’_’ When Pittites con-
tribute to this fund they will revel in the fact that per-
haps they have placed a microscope in the hands of a
young scientist, or saved a student from the clutches of
a disease. -
WSSF is our ‘victory in European rehabilitation, «hot our
defeat. Let’s make today’s dream tomorr-ow’s reality for our
colleagues in Europe. '

Chapel Windows Seen
As True ./Wasterpieces

“A symphony in color” and_ a masterpiece in composition is the
Heinz chapel-—oﬁering not only its stained glass windows and its
gothic architecture, but also a wealth of interesting facts behind its
construction and stories of the people who have visited it.

Realizing the signiﬁcance of these stories, Miss Jean Robinson,
faculty hostess of the chapel since last February and assistant to
the dean of women, has kept a diary of some of her experiences

there. Besides the diary,
Robinson keeps records, books,
and statistics concerning attend-
ance all revealing the unusual
personality of the chapel.

Charles J. Connick, master-
workman in the construction of
the windows, once said, “They are
a symphony in color: the chancel
windows are the ellegro, the tran-
cept, the great marching andante,
the clerestory, theminuet and the
naithex windows. the ﬁnale.”

For eight years Connick and his
men worked on the glass sym-
pxhony’s composition. Built to
color the daylight as it passes
through andrto withstand wind
and rain, the windows weigh 15
tons in all.

Of their total weight ﬁve and a

{half tons are the weight of the

Miss¢

trancept windows and six and a
half, that of the bronze armatures
which brace the windows. More
than 3200 pounds of,putty cover
the lead that holds the quarter
million pieces of glass in place.
The tranceptiwindows are 78
feet high, the tallest in the world.
The top ﬁgures in them are seven
feet high and irregularly shaped,

so that they appear in correct pro-
portions from the chapel ﬂoor.

From Miss Robinson’s diary
comes the noteworthy account of
one distinguished visiitor——a man
who might have been a king!
Tall, impeccably dressed. Duke du
Pont de Nemours would b king
of France today, were the mon-
archy still alive. I

Panther Rally Fails
To Catch Tall Cadets

Trailing by 13 points at the intermission, Pitt’s try-hard

Panthers rallied brilliantly in
catch Army’s rangy Cadets as

the second half but failed to
they succumbed, 60-53.

The Wild second half, which saw Pitt outscore Army 38-
32, kept 4500 fans in a constant uproar. With seven minutes
remaining the Carlsonites pulled within eight points of the

sizzling Cadets. But Army main-9

tained its advantage until the gun.
Rawers Leads Scorers
Takinglfull advantage of their
superior height, Army depended
upon Jim Rawer.s and George
Shepherd to notch its second win.
Rawers led the scorers with 20
points on seven ﬁeld goals and
six fouls. However it was the ﬁne
ﬂoor play —- particularly under
the basket — of Shepherd which
enabled the Cadets to dominate
the play. He tallied 19 points.
Sammy David and Dodo Can-
terna peppered the Army basket
from all angles to spark the des-
perate second stanza rally.
Pa.-ithers Disappoint
The defeat came as a distinct
disappointment to Pitt followers.
Army opened the season six days
ago by squeaking past Swarth-
more, 43-42. Since losing four
contests in the Mid-West, Pitt had

. trounced Penn State and Carnegie

Tech.

Pitt’s n-ext tussle is with Geneva
Saturday night at Beaver Falls.
Coached by Slim Ransom, the

 Dry perfume makes your
favorite Roger & Gallef

fragrance go farther. Its
tantalizing sceniis released
gradually when patted di- '
rectly on warm skin. A dash
in the hem of your dance
dress ﬁlls the air with fade-
less perfume. Doused inside
your blouse, the effect is
really terrific! Use it regu-
|arly—-in all ways—iusi‘ like
liquid perfume. '
