UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH"

SEI protest ends with
arrests of two men

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Two Pittsburgh men, Vincent
Eirene and Kevin Forsythe, were
arrested on Friday on charges of
obstructing traffic and disorderly
conduct at the Software Engineer-
ing lnstitute, according to Pitts-
burgh police.

The two men, along with about
15 others, were taking part in a
peace rally to expose military
contracts at the campus of Car-
negie Mellon University.

Eirene and Forsythe were both
sentenced to one day in jail. Both
men had prior arrest records for
similar incidents.

Prior to the demonstration on
Friday, protesters slept all week
in front of CMU’s Dougherty Hall
in a vigil for peace. At.7:0O am.
on Friday, one hour before the
march to the SEI building, Eirene
said that he intended to block the
entrance to the SEl’s parking in a
symbolic attempt to halt the ef-
forts of SEI workers.

According to Eirene, SEI is in-
volved with the Star Wars pro-
gram ”as well as other weapon
technology.

”We plan to block traffic,” Ei-
rene continued. ”We will be
charged with obstructing traffic.
We want to obstruct SEl ~— ob-
struct that which leaves our
brothers and sisters poor and
hungry.”

Eirene said that he has choos-
en ”civil disobedience” to get his
message across because he said
in the past ” the law has protect-
ed injustices.” Eirene cited the
Vietnam War as one such inci-
dent. ”We must transgress
justice, as it has transgressed us,”

 

    
  

he said.

Before the march, Forsythe
said, ’’I believe we need to redis-
cover a way to preach the gospel
in a way that blocks traffic.” For-
sythe explained that when money
is poured into weapons technol-
ogy, it is being taken away from
the poor and hungry.

Eirene said that he and Forsythe
did not want to be represented by
an attorney after their arrest. ”We
don't want to defend ourselves,”
he said.

As the group marched to the
SEI building, several drivers
honked their car horns and
cheered. But when the protesters
reached the front of the SEI build-
ing, they were met by police and
federal agents.

After holding up banners read-
ing ”Earth Peace, Not Star Wars"
and ”Divest War” to those pass-
ing by on Fifth Avenue, the group
marched around the building to
the parking garage. Eirene and
Forsythe knelt down in front of
the garage entrance as other pro-
testers stood across the street,
cheering them on.

When traffic began to get
backed up, police used one of the
garage exits as an entrance for SEI
workers. Eirene responded by
kneeling in front of the new en-
trance.

When police opened up a se-
cond exit as an entrance, Eirene
and Forsythe walked out onto S.
Dithridge Street and lay down.
The two men blocked both sides
of the street as irate drivers com-
plained to police.

Pittsburgh police Sgt. Bondi
walked to both men and asked
them if they would get up. When

Union votes to accept
Giant Eagle contract

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Local 23 of the United Food
and Commercial Workers Union
met last night and voted 1615 to
459 to accept a new cont-ract
reached on Friday with Giant Ea-
gle food stores.

According to local 23 UFCW
president Carl C. Huber, the
agreement ”accomplishes
enough of what we [the union]
wanted to do.”

Conditions of the new contract
include a $1.00 per hour premi-
um for Sunday and Holiday
work, a $ .50 raise, and a $ .50
per hour premium for employees
hired after the contract’s ratifica-
tion. Also, step—parents will be ad-

ded to death benefits and the
company will make increased
contributions in the health and
welfare fund.

According to Huber, the un-
ion's strategy was to make Giant
Eagle realize that they cannot
’’walk around” the bargaining
committee. He said that the un-
ion prevented this by setting a
definite strike deadline, by build-
ing pressure and by making sure
the union members held
together.

Huber stressed the importance
of unity in going up against the
”20th largest retailer in the coun-
try.” He said, ”We wish to estab-
lish realistic goals and give up
nothing at the bargaining table.”

   

TUNNELTON, Pa. —— Thirteen
protesters, upset that tear gas
used by Israeli soldiers against
Arab dissenters is manufactured
in an Indiana County plant, were
arrested after chaining them-
selves to the factory’s front gate,

’ police said.

The demonstrators, all but one
of them from out-of-state and
seven of them from California,

"were cut free from the gate by

state police using bolt cutters
Saturday after they failed to hand
deliver a letter to plant officials.

Members of a group called
”The Committee to Stop Chemi-
cal Aggression Against Palestini-
ans,” the protesters were released
after posting bond of $348.50 on
criminal trespass charges. Two
were held after the others were
released because they could not
immediately post bond.

The plant's parent company
said last week it was concerned
about how tear gas canisters
manufactured at the Federal
Laboratories, Inc., plant were be-
ing used by the Israeli soldiers.

days before taking a brief election

Attention early in the week
should focus on the beleaguered
Catastrophic Loss Trust Fund,
which has fallen into legislative
limbo since House Speaker K. Le-
roy lrvis, D-Allegheny, refused to
accept a bill from the Senate that
would abolish the fund.

Some Senate leaders described
lrvis’ action as ”unprecedented.”
lrvis contends the Senate did not
follow proper procedure in mak-
ing changes in the legislation,
which earlier had been passed by
the House.

Stephen MacNett, chief coun-
sel to the Senate Republicans,
said a messenger would again
bring the bill back to the House
to see if it would be accepted.

Protestors angry at sale of tear gas to Israel

In floor action last week, the
Senate split the bill into several
sections to enable members to re-
ject some provisions and endorse
others. lrvis said that was not
proper procedure. He said the
Senate should either have reject-
ed the bill as a whole, approved
it as a whole or made further
amendments and sent it back to
the House.

”The issue is whether we're go-
ing to follow the correct
parliamentary procedure in deal-
ing with this or any other legisla-
tion," lrvis said in a statement.

MacNett countered: ’’If they
disagree with the Senate ap-
proach, the normal course of
events is to put it before the mem-
bers and vote. By denying the
members the right to vote is keep-
ing the CAT in operation.”

Tony Barbush, an aide to
House Majority Leader James
Manderino, D-Westmoreland,
said it was unclear what action
House leaders would take next
week. The chamber does not
have to be in session for bills‘to'

Attorney warns Roe
vs. Wade may be out

PITTSBURGH — The new U.S.
Supreme Court seems more like-
ly than ever to overrule the land-
mark Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized abortions, says the at-
torney who successfully argued
the case 15 years ago.

”|t’s',hard to predict what they'll
do” especially after splitting 4-4
last year on the issue, said attor-
ney Sarah Weddington of Austin,
Texas.

”I would have to say to you,
honestly, I am concerned about
its future,” she said while ad-
dressing members of Women's
Health Services.

Recent protests by blacks at

”There is such a rawness to

Delta Sigs, Deltsi tie Greek Week

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

Due to an oversight of the
dance marathon chairmen, Del-
ta Sigma Phi failed to receive
points for $740 raised for the
Western Pennsylvania School for
Blind Children, according to Lee
Brody, overall co-chairperson of
Greek Week.

The mistake was brought to the
attention of Brady at the Greek
Week formal when brothers of
Delta Sigma Phi protested their
standing of third place overall in
Greek Week.

After considering the addition-
al $740, Brody, Robin Hunn,
Greek Week overall co-
chairperson, and Randy Meck,
business manager for Greek
Week, announced a_ first place tie
between Delta Sigma Phi and
Delta Tau Delta in Greek Week.

Delta Sigma Phi’s score was
percisly .09 of a point below that
of Delta Tau Delta's. However, in
light of the closeness of the

scores, Brody said that ”a tie was
in order.” 1

According to Chuck Farinella,
lnterfraternity Council president,
”The presidents of each of the
fraternities involved now have

‘ 

It would be bad for
the whole greek system
if the decision was ap-
pealed

— lohn Murphy

the opportunity to appeal the
proposal [of a tie between both
fraternities]. If no appeals are
heard, the tie stands.”

Farinella added that if an ap-
peal is made by either house, the
Judicial Board will decide the
outcome.

John Murphy, Delta Sigma Phi

president, said ”We weren't too
happy [when the standings were
announced at the formal]. We ex-
pected first or second place, but
we will accept the tie. it would
be bad for the whole greek sys-
tem if the decision was ap-
pea|ed.”

According to Brody, Sue Mor-

row and Bill Breitenbaugh, the‘

overall dance marathon chair-
men accepted Delta Sigma Phi’s

pledge sheets a day earlier than ,

the designated day to submit
funds, thus causing confusion in
the totals.

Morrow and Breitenbaugh
were unavailable for comment.

Brody said, ”The chairman got
confused and lumped [the pledge
sheets] in a different pile. The
chairman shouldn't have taken
the sheets."

Brody, a Delta Tau Delta
brother, said that his house is ”in
compliance" with the decision as
far as he knows.

Angry man says wife's pregnancy ruined their sex life

Q: My wife believes seriously
that I avoid sex because of deep-
seated childhood repressions,
deep—seated homosexual lean-
ings and several other things, all
deep-seated. Actually, it is be-
cause while she was pregnant,
she gave up being the kind of
woman who attracts me. I mean
that she began wearing teenage
s/oppy-joe clothes and has never

. gone back to the kind of dressing

up and grooming she took pride
in from our first meeting until late
in pregnancy.

I think six months after giving
birth is too long to keep up the
gimme-a-break—I’m-bushed act. I
buy her things but she won't put
them on. She has collapsed en-
tirely in personal style. Have I got
to pretend to be aroused by this
willfully unattractive woman?

A: Hey, you sound a little
harsh. Give us all a break, includ-

ing your wife. Becoming the par-
ent of a real child can take the
starch out of any man or woman
for a while. I don't say that for her
to get back to her prior style
would not be good for both of
you, but maybe it is up to you to
make it happen.

 
DR. RI.|'I'H
WESTHEIMER

Maybe a dinner out. Arrange
for some friends to go out with
you —— an event at which your
wife will be required by the
friends to dress and groom ap-
propriately. And at reasonable in-
tervals, arrange more such
events. And stop buying her
clothes to "put on.” That is
demoralizing.

Instead, see that she has money

to buy her own clothes; tell her

you want her to get herself nice
things and assert her special style
the way she used to because you
always loved that and want her
to look like that again. You can
say that you want that baby to
grow up thinking of mother as a
wonderful—looking woman, not
just a drudge. Give her money to
shop for herself with — that is so
much more fun‘ and arouses a
person's interest in looking good,
and requires getting up inner
energy for shopping trips and
thinking and planning purchases.

If she still resists, I think you
have to have a little talk and find
out what is going on with her. It
may be resentment, thinking you
don't do your share of housework
or babytending. That idea may
surprise you, but from her point
of view it may be a serious one.
Find out if that is it, or what it is.
If her resistance persists, you may
need to see a marriage counselor.

It's your last course in economics, and there's no
"final”. Only the keys to a brand new Chew. Thanks

Q: This guy I go with actually
doesn't go. He stays. He works
where he lives. And I go there
when I quit workilng. His wor-
kroom, bedroom, living room
and kitchen area are one big
space and a dusty one, too. He
is kind of fascinating and crea-
tive, but I do not like always
hanging out there — eating,
listening to music, watching
videos and especially I don't like
making love there. He says motel
or hotel lovemaking is bourgeois.
That is a joke, but he won't go
out anywhere and that is a fact.
He has the money, but he says
not the time. I go there to be with
him and he is working.

A: All I can think of is your rent-
ing a room and asking him to go
there with you. It just may be that
if you pay he will agree. Other-
wise, i think some night when
you wake up and he is back at
work, you will just have to dress

and tiptoe out and never go back,
but look for someone who has
some of the same ideas and feel-
ings that you have.

This man is a hard case if I ever
heard of one, and if the idea of
going out of his way to please a
woman ever enters his mind, you
do not seem to be the woman.
What else do you do with him,
besides hanging out in his dusty
studio or whatever it is? I bet not
a movie, because that is too
”bourgeois” too.

If you really want to hang onto
this man, don't go on making
love in an unappetizing place.
Before long, that will turn you off
the guy as well. Don't, whatever
you do, clean up his studio or
office or whatever it is —— that will
only make you mad because it
will slide back into a mess and
you will resent having wasted
your hard work. .

The situation became danger-

and out between the two men.
When one car tried to squeeze in
between Forsythe and the curb in
an attempt to get into the garage,
Forsythe got up and threw him-
self in the way. At this point,
police arrested both men and
took them to the Public Safty

According to an SEI spokesper-

We have to teach
ourselves not to hate

Over the course of the past year, there has been a growing
concern among black students at Penn State's University Park
campus about the failure of a five-year plan to increase black
enrollment to 5 percent (it now stands at 3.7 percent). Those

vill feelings came to a head last week when 91 of the 150 stu-

dents who had staged a sit-in at a university building were ar-

rested.

The students were requesting a meeting with Penn State presi-
dent Bryce Jordan. The meeting was scheduled after the arrests.
The Penn State students were protesting the lack of what they
called ”support” for black students there. The feelings of alien-
ation have been fed by racist posters around campus and the

lack of black faculty members.

We support the Penn State students completely in/their ef-
forts to win equality. in a.Predominantly white school, agproblem

that has been.a:ll' tool apparent at Pitt as well.   »

While there certainly is a necessity for official policies to help
ease racial tensions, real progress will never occur until each
person realizes that the only way to effectively combat racism
is on a personal level. We have to teach ourselves tolerance
before we can teach someone else.

In a nutshell

Is Bush really going to win?

Oh well. It looks as though
Marx really was right when he
said that history repeats itself, first
as tragedy and then as farce.
That's Karl, not Groucho.

Hisenberg was right as well. At
the base of everything in the
universe, there is randomness.

It's a bad combination.

There was something I wanted
to say, but it slipped my mind. It
was something about people not
getting along, about how it's real-
ly hard to understand killing
someone, for their ideas, but that
wasn?t it exactly.

They. (whoare they?) say that
in an infinite universe, everything
has been done before. Why do
we keep making the same mis-
takes? That wasn't what I wanted
to say either. Why are we getting

?'=?e“adytto elect George Bush?

I heard it had something to do
with a male hormone imbalance

MATTHEW
THORNTON

in the collective unconscious,
something to do with a need for
machismo. The dominated need
to oppress to regain their self-
worth, and the American way is
the only safe path to travel. We
fund and arm the people who
agree with us, and kill those who
don't. Again.

That's not really what I wanted
to say either, but it's getting a lit-
tle closer. The word ”sopho—
more” literally means intelligent
fool. Sophomoric generally refers
to a condition very _like adoles-
cent pseudo-angst. Hormones

. usually cause the most problems

during adolescence. They (again)
say that a missile is little but a
thinly disguised phallus.

It's a pity, but is looks as though
too many world leaders are think-
ing with their missiles. There's a
funny trend in military thought.
There has generally been an in-
crease in the feeling that killing
people isn't such a good idea.
Populations are less interested in
going to war. The death penalty
is harder to impose. ‘Human
rights violations get more press
than presidential speeches.

At the same time, the weapons
we use, from_our hands, to the
stick, to the spear, to the bow and

_ arrow, to the gun, to the artillery

weapons to intercontinental mis-
siles, have been moving the user
farther from the target. Are these
two things connected?

That really wasn't what I want-
ed to say either. Why, though, are
we getting ready to elect Bush?

spective editor for The Pitt News.

The Tax Simplification Act is a bloody farce

When they write the linguistic
history of the 1980s — com-
memorating all those wonderful
phrases like ”Peacekeeper" and
”Star Wars” -— I hope they give
notice to the greatest misnomer
of them all: The Tax Simplifica-
tion Act. Yes, Tax Simplification.
This was the pristine notion that
the government could not only
lower taxes but also lower the
threshold of confusion and math-
phobia among taxpayers.

In the greatest switch-and-bait
operation of the period, we
bought simplification. But what
did we receive? Exactly 48 new
tax forms, 2,704 changes in the
code and a 48-page instruction
booklet that reads like an English
translation of a manual for oper-
ating a Japanese computer
program.

In its first year, tax reform may
have resulted in the largest trans-
fer of income in the century. Any
money that might have been
retrieved from the government's
coffers went directly to the ac-
countants.

r_l i_.5|,l',‘.,

But this is not another mid-
April diatribe against the govern-
ment. I am convinced that sim-
plification was doomed from the
start. When, after all, was the last
time anything in your life was ac-
tually simplified?

Consider the equipment you
deal with every day: the dash-
board of your car, the instruction
panel of your VCR. Consider the
day itself, the increasing variety
of ‘things that are inscribed in
your minute-at-a-glance book?

The direction of American life
is relentlessly moving from gener-
alist to specialist, from simple to
complex. We no longer have one
doctor’s name; we have an entire
list, each corresponding to a
different part of our anatomy. We
no longer work, eat, sleep and
take care of our families in one
location; we spend our lives com-
muting along some personal as-
sembly line, from home to school
to work to shop.

The tax system is nothing more
or less than a metaphor for this
technological and personal scat-

'L..'.:-: at as U .’ S ,_~,

.
~...=.r. ,.

GOODMAN

tering. The forms that have
proliferated are a reflection of the
increasing number of things we
are supposed to know about.
There's just too much informa-
tion. And .the IRS wants it all.

Jeremy Rifkin, a man of maver-
ick intelligence at the Foundation‘
on Economic Trends,. has thought
a good deal about the fragment-
ed society. He says: ”The IRS
deals with individuals as a
productive unit. But that unit is

mu it. ~'.

 

increasingly Balkanized, divided,
subsetted.”

In the past, the average Ameri-
can ”production unit” generally
had one source of income and
worked in one location, had one
pension at best, one bank ac-
count, no mortgage and no credit
card. Now, in accordance with
time and trends, we have many
of the above, each with a form to
fill out.

The person with a computer at
home can work at home and
deduct at home. And then prove
it to the IRS. The bank that offers
more credit options than the
airline offers fares will give you
a home equity loan. In return, the
IRS will hand you the science-
fiction creature of the new tax
laws, Form 8598. MIT graduates
have paled when confronted by
it.

As for retirement income, it
now comes in more flavors’ than
ice cream, from IRAs to Social
Security to military and company

pensions. Each has its own mean- ,

in (and calculations) to its own

”prodctive unit” and that produc-
tive unit-watcher, the tax man.

It's not just our professional
lives that have divided into the
sum of their tax-relevant areas; so
have our personal lives. Any
number of fractured families
spend April playing the game
called ”Who Gets the Kids as a
Tax Deduction?"

”It’s a mess,” says Rifkin, who
relates it to the decline and fall of
everybody’s favorite empire.
"When Rome got too complex in
all its interactions, we got the
Middle Ages with the manor
system.”

That sort of nostslgia won't get
you a tax-ﬁling extension until the
barbarians are at the gate. The
realityis that taxes imitate life.
This is the time of year that the
IRS takes stock of our lives. The
tool for the job is that wonder of
the era, The Tax Simplification
Act.

syndicated columnist for The

Jews mark anniversary of Warsaw Ghetto uprising

By Dan Blake

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Thousands
gathered Sunday to mark the up-
rising of imprisoned Jews in the
Warsaw ghetto and to remember
the 6 million killed during the
Holocaust.

About 20 wreaths, one dedicat-
ed ”To Our Lost Family,” were
placed at the base of ”The
Memorialto the Six Million Jew-
ish Martyrs,” a sculpture depict-
ing arms and horrified faces

reaching out from under the
weight of burning timbers.

”Never again may Jews be sub-
ject to mass murder and rascist
designs of extermination,” David
Ben—Dov, Israel's consul general
to Philadelphia, told the crowd of
more than 3,000.

The Holocaust ceremony has
been held each year in mid-April,
about the time the Warsaw ghet-
to uprisings began, since the
25-foot tall sculpture was given to
the city in 1964.

”Every year I come here, I see

in your faces the pain, the suffer-
ing and determination. Determi-
nation [that] will never, never
happen again to humankind,”
Mayor W. Wilson Goode said.

During the Nazi occupation,
about 500,000 Jews were packed
into the Warsaw ghetto. Those
who did not die of hunger and
disease were shipped to concen-
tration camps daily. On April 19,
1943, about 600 revolted against
their captors.

Although surrounded, the
resistance fighters held out for

nearly three weeks.

The memorial Sunday featured
a tribute to Mordechai Anie-
lewicz, leader of the uprising,
and other fighters who died in the
first armed rebellion of a Jewish
underground group against the
Nazis.

A candle-lighting ceremony
honoring the resistance and those
who survived was preceded by
readings from letters, literature
and songs marking the ghetto and
the revolt.

”The destruction of the War-
saw ghetto, which was to be a
birthday present for Hitler, be-
came instead a full-pledged bat-
tle and an everlasting measure of
human valor,” Barbara Green-
span Eisenbud, co-chairwoman
of the memorial’s planning com-
mittee, said in introducing the
readings.

Five candles representing
different forms of resistance and
a final candle in memory of those
who survived were lit.

Dukakis leads in polls as Pa. primary approaches

By Rich Kirkpatrick.‘

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — Pennsylva-
nia, waiting in the wings for just
a few more days, is about to

move to center stage in the’

presidential primary showcase.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, leading in polls in both
New. York and Pennsylvania, is
banking on ;-the two northeastern

. states to help ‘cement his, status as

front—runner. . .  .

After New York's Tuesday
primary, in ‘which 255 delegates
will be picked, the national focus
will shift to Pennsylvania forone
week, culminating in its primary

April 26.

”Mike won't get over the
delegate top until summer, but
Pennsylvania has the opportuni-
ty to put Mike over the psycho-
logical top with a big primary
victory,” said Dukakis’ Pennsyl-
vania coordinator, Pat McCarthy.

Though Dukakis has had broad
support ‘among young and old,
blue and whiteycollar, men and
women, some "p"ol'ls have indicat-
ed the support is“?not rock solid;
at least not as committed as those
supporting the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

”Mike has-taken.n.othing for
granted and will be campaigning
all over the state,” McCarthy said.

THE PITTNEW , Monday April 18 1988

Panther Prin s, the
official yearbook of the
University of Pittsburgh,
is the only publication
that can provide you
with a complete review
of the memorable events
of this past year. To
capture the true
meaning of Pitt, we have
made a concerted effort
to detail the people,
places and events which
make this university so
unique. As the university
progresses toward the

AP source: Israel assassinated PLO official  

JERUSALEM — Israeli sources
said Sunday that Israeli agents
had assassinated PLO official
Khalil al—Wazir, the No. 2 man in
the organization who headed the
uprising in the occupied terri-
tories.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
declined comment.

The sources said the operation
was carried out jointly by the
ftlossad intelligence service, the
Israeli navy and an elite comman-

do unit. They spoke on condition

of anonymity.

They said it had been post-
poned several times before
Saturday.

A|—Wazir, who was in charge of
the PLO’s military operations
against Israel, was shot to death
Saturday at his home in the Tu-
nis suburb of La Marsa by an
eight—member squad.

Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion officials blamed Israel, say-

’ ing the killing was designed to

demoralize Palestinians and end
PLO-directed protests in the oc-
cupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

”I’m not ready to relate to these
matters,” Shamir told The As-
sociated Press at his office in
Jerusalem when asked about
reports Israel was behind the
operation.

Foreign» Minister Shimon Peres,

co—leader of the coalition govern-
ment, said in an interview on Is-
rael radio that he hoped
a|—Wazir’s assassination would
not affect peace efforts.

NBC television said Shamir,
Peres and Defense Minister Yit-

zhak‘ Rabin approved the assassi-
nation after Fatah guerrillas
hijacked a bus and killed three Is-
raelis in southern Israel's Negev
desert last month.

Former intelligence officials

NEWS BRIEFS

‘ASSOCIATED PRESS
T

and Israeli newspapers openly
compared the assassination to Is-
rael's April 1973 raid on PLO

_ offices in Beirut in which three

top PLO officials were killed.

The 1973. slaying was aimed at
Ali Hassan Salameh, known as
Abu Hassan, the PLO’s security
and intelligence chief who later
died in a car bomb attack. In-
stead, Al—Wazir’s predecessor,
Kamel Adwan, Fatah spokesman
Kamal Nasser and Mohammed
Abu Najjar, a key figure in the
Black September terror group,
were killed.

Threelsraelis involved in the
1973 raid now hold senior secu-
rity positions.

Verdict due today in
Dem/‘an/'ukNazi trial

JERUSALEM — John Demjan-
juk, who has spent the past 11
years fighting charges he was the
notorious Nazi death camp guard
”Ivan the Terrible,” faces a ver-
dict Monday in: his 14-month-
long court battle in Israel.

The three-judge panel's
450-page judgment is based on

more than 15,000 pages of emo-
tionally charged testimony from
Holocaust survivors, documents
experts and the suspect himself.

Holocaust mastermind Adolf
Eichmann, the only other Nazi
war criminal to be tried in Israel,
was convicted and hanged in
1962. Unlike Eichmann, Dem-
janjuk has insisted he is an inno-
cent victim of mistaken identity.

The retired autoworker from
Cleveland, Ohio, is charged with
operating gas chambers that’
killed 850,000 Jews at the Treb-
linka death camp in Nazi-
occupied Poland in 1942 and
1943.

Many observers argue the case
against Demjanjuk has not been
proven beyond a shadow of a
doubt, despite the tearful insis-
tence of five death camp sur-
vivors who claim to recognize
the defendant as ”Ivan” more
than 40 years after the Holocaust.

But few Israelis doubt the
judges will hand in a guilty ver-
dict. For them, the only question
is whether the Ukrainian—born
Demjanjuk, 68, will be spared
the death penalty.

If Demjanjuk is found guilty
Monday, he will be sentenced at
a later, separate hearing.

About 250,000 spectators at-
tended the trial’s 106 sessions,
which the government held in a
converted movie theater at a cost
of $650,000.

Despite holes in the prosecu— ’
tion case, Demjanjuk was
plagued throughout the trial by a
stumbling defense team which
seemed to move two steps back-

always been g

Demjanjuk’s relatives raised
more than $650,000 for the
defense, but the lawyers often ap-
peared unprepared, failed to
come up with a coherent account
of his whereabouts during World
War II and antagonized judges by
engaging in behavior bordering
on the absurd. Two defense wit-
nesses walked off the stand in the
middle of cross—examination, one
claiming the defense had threa-
tened a lawsuit if he continued to
testify.

FAA extends airplane
review to Continental

WASHINGTON — Transporta-
tion Secretary Jim Burnley said
Sunday that the department will
expand its airplane-to—airplane in-
spection to a second Texas Air
Corp. subsidiary, Continental
Airlines, beginning Monday.

The planned inspection comes
less than a week after the Feder-
al Aviation Administration began
checking Eastern Airlines, a
major carrier in the Texas Air em-
pire —— the nation's largest airline

company. The FAA also slapped
Eastern with $823,000 in fines for
violating safety regulations.
”We’re going to extend the
ramp inspections, intensive in-
spection, that we began on
Eastern last Wednesday to Con-
tinental as well, beginning tomor-

row,” Burnley said on NBC—TV’s‘

Meet the Press.

The Transportation Department
head said the inquiry will be just
like the Eastern investigation.

In another development, Burn-
ley said the department found
almost $1 million in violations by
Continental during a review of
the carrier's files at Texas Air.

The violations, including some
that Continental identified itself,
are ”being acted on,” he said.

US oil production
will increase in '88

WASHINGTON —— Domestic
crude oil production in the 19905
should be higher than previous-
ly expected and demand for
natural gas will be markedly
higher, according to the Energy
Department's annual forecast.

AIDS-related deaths are stead-
ily growing in the United States
while more pressure is being put
on the scientific research commu-
nity to find a cure. From time to
time, so-called ”miracle cures”
appear in the media that are not
properly tested and are denied
approval by the FDA due to a

lack of evidence.

The Medizone company of
New York is currently testing
hyperoxygenation, one possible
”miracle cure” for AIDS.
Hyperoxygenation was in-
troduced into the United States
by Europe and Mexico and en-
tails the use of ozone and hydro-
gen peroxide. These two
substances are said to restore the
body's oxygen supply, although
they are highly toxic when con-
centrated.

Ozone is produced by forcing
oxygen through a metal tube with
a charge of 300 volts. This is in-
jected into a pint of the patient’s
blood; then they are mixed

together. Most of the virus is said
to be destroyed since the ozone
molcules dissolve and oxygenate
the blood. The disease is believed
not to return as long as the patient
follows a healthy diet, exercises
and breathes ”properly”.

The Medizone Company
claims to have received an IND
(Investigative New Drug) ap-
proval from the FDA last summer.
Testing on animals was complet-
ed in the fall of 1986, demonstrat-
ing that the ozone destroys the
AIDS virus and that there was no
indication of toxicity.

On Dec. 30, I986, the United
States granted a patent to Medi-
zone for its process of ”inactivat-

v :.« -3 

ing lipid-envelope viruses in
blood that is returned to a mam-
malian host”. However, the FDA
has denied Medizone approval to
begin testing on humans.

Theresa Young, FDA Con-
sumer Affairs Officer, said, ”The
FDA has made AIDS a priority.
Any type of .therapeutic treatment
for AIDS is looked at first.”

Another possible AIDS treat-
ment is hydrogen peroxide,
which is backed by the Interna-
tional Bio-Oxidative Medicine
Foundation (IBOM) in Texas.

In this treatment, hydrogen
may be taken orally, absorbed
through the skin by bathing, or in-
jected in more severe cases. The

   Mondag? April 18, 1933

FDA reluctant to approve of ’miracle cures’ for AIDS

hydrogen peroxide is diluted with
water to meet the therapeutic
regulations set by the researchers,

This, like the ozone, is said to
oxidize the cells, killing disease
organisms including cancerous
growths. The FDA has issued
warnings that the chemical com-
panies do not sell hydrogen
peroxide to people wanting it
”for health purposes,” althou h
hydrogen peroxide treatments
have been used freely throughout
Mexico.

”It [hyper-oxygenation treat-
ment] is an outright health fraud,”
said Young. ’It is annoying know-
"18 that they are preying on peo-
ple with these diseases.”

Pitt receives grant to study new AIDS drug

By Rich Cholodofsky
Staff Writer I

The University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine and the
Hemophiliac Center of Western
Pennsylvania have beenjfa'w,ard-

Deficiency Virus(HlV), thelvirus
that is the forerunner to AIDS.
Pitt was one of ten hemophili-
ac centers awarded the grant. The
grants were divided regionally,
with Pitt acting as the coordina-
tion center for Pennsylvania,
Delaware, West Virginia, Vir-

 

ginia, Maryland and Washington,
D.C.

”About nine or 10 months ago,
we became aware that there
would be money available for a
study of this kind, and we applied

 it,”.,sai'd Dr. Margret V. Rag-
ed a four—year ‘$883,000 grant to 
treat and »monlt‘o‘r. hemophiliacs  gs

it will help them get state of the
art treatment,” said Ragni.

The study will consist of treat-
ing participants with the drug
AZT, which has been shown to
help in AIDS and AIDS related
cases.

Ragni said, ”The study will an-
swer questions asto whether AZT
will stop HIV, or whether AZT
will stop or slow down the acqui-
sition of AIDS.”

According to Ragni, the study
is designed to see if there are any
liver-related side effects. Since
AZT.is a drug that is synthesized

through the liver, Ragni ex-

plained, ”You have to be careful
because of the underlying liver
disfunction, which is a result of
blood transfusions.”

This was the first grant award-
ed to study hemophiliacs infect-
ed with HIV in the country. Pitt's
region was chosen to be the first

to begin the study.

Patients will be recruited
through the Hemophilia Center;-‘
Recruits need to be over 12 years
of age and currently experiencing
no AIDS or AIDS-related sym-
ptoms, but must be HIV-infected.

There will be several trials in
the study, with only the AZT tri-
al definitely set. Subjects will be
randomized as to whether they
receive the druglor a placebo.
The subjects will be tested and
examined for the next two years.

People who qualify and are in-
terested in participating in the

study can call 647-8064 to

register.

THE PITT NEWS

Select Panthers e All-Pitt News team

The following list of players
received the most votes in a poll
recently conducted by The Pitt
News sports staff. They were vot-
ed upon for their excellence in
Panther athletics.

Ezekial Gadlson

Gadson, a 6-foot—1, 210-pound
linebacker on the Panther foot-
ball team, emerged as a defensive
superstar during the 1987 season.
Last year, the senior from Frog-
more, S.C., collected 24‘/2 sacks
(a Pitt record), 137 tackles, 19
tackles for a loss and caused six
fumbles.

Gadson also played in the East-

‘West Shrine Game in Palo Alto,

Calif.

Blessed with raw strength,
speed and quickness, Gadson is
currently under the watchful eyes
of NFL scouts, who project him
as possibly becoming a safety in
the pro ranks.

One NFL head coach who is
extremely high on Gadson is Bill
Parcells, coach of the 1986
World Champion New York Gi-
ants. Parcells, impressed with
Gadson’s flexibility on the field,
termed him as a "transition'play—
er," a defender with the capabil-
ity of covering both wide
receivers on pass routes and run-

“ning’back's out of the backfield.”

Sources say Parcells expects
Gadson to be taken in the second

I or third round of the upcoming

NFL draft. . V

Pitthead football coach Mike
Gottfried agrees with Parcells. ”I
think he'll go relatively high in
the draft. I think he's going to be
a great pro." -

”I enjoyed playing at Pitt, and _

I'm excited about the possibility
of playing in the NFL,” Gadson
said of his career. ”I thiifk Ican
help a team with my ability. I just
want to play.'.'.. .  .

Smith, the 6-foot-10 center for
the Panther basketball team, aver-
aged 18.6 points per game and
7.6 rebounds a game en route to
capturing the Big East Player of
the Year honors.

Smith decided to return to Pitt
for his senior season and, in the
process, broke the Panther all-
time scoring record with 2,045
points. He passed Clyde Vau-

”I still feel about the same as
I did after the match was over,"
Santoro said. ”To me, it's some-

This season,‘Smith is expected

Smith has indicated he would
like to stay in the east.

”I expect to be taken early in

Heyward was named a first-

and also ran for 254 yards on 39
carries against a highly-touted Mi-
ami defense last season.
Heyward has been in training
for the NFL draft in Phoenix, Ariz.
since he left Pittsburgh in Febru-
ary and has reportedly dropped
his weight to 255 pounds.

Lee Mc Rae

Sprint sensation McRae is the
finest track and field athlete to
ever perform at the University of

' Pittsburgh. In addition to being an

eight time All-American, he re-
cently became only the third in-
dividual in the history of the
NCAA Indoor Championships to
win three consecutive 55-meter
dash titles.

Among McRae’s aspirations is
spending this summer in Seoul,
South Korea as a member of the

_ United States Olympic Team. It

would afford him the opportuni-
ty to become only the third Pitt
athlete to ever win the gold,
previous winners being Johnny
Woodruff in the 800-meter run in
1936 and Roger Kingdom in the
110-meter hurdles in 1984.

When assessing his chances in
the Olympics, McRae had this to
say: ”My chances are very good.
I'm currently third in the United
States and sixth in the world and
I'm looking fon/vard to improving
on that.”

McRae has been more selective
in the meets he competes in this
spring than ever before. ”I’m
picking my meets here and there.
Lajst year, I got burned out,” he
said.

Pitt sprint coach Steve Lewis is
justifiably proud of McRae and
his accomplishments. ”As far as
his [Lee's] growth and develope-
ment [are concerned], he has
really grown as a person and he
has shown tremendous growth as
an athlete [in his time at Pitt].”

Lorri Johnson

Johnson, a 5-foot-11 redshirt
freshman and Proposition 48
casualty from‘New Castle High
School, led the Lady Panthers to
a 14-15 record this past season,
the first time the women's basket-
ball team has won more than 11

games since 1984-85.

Pitt also finished the season
5-11 and seventh in the league,
the first time in three years that
they have not finished eighth or
ninth.

Despite‘ scoring a team-high
14.6 pointsand 6.2 rebounds per
game, Johnson was ignored by
other teams when All-Big East
and All-Freshman teams were an-
nounced.

But Johnson was twice named
Big East Freshman-of-the-Week in
February after recording back-to-
back career best games in late
February.

Johnson's obvious impact on
the Pitt squad was not overlooked
by her teammates, however. She
was named the team's Most Valu-
able Player after her first season
in the blue and gold uniform.

Johnson also proved that she
was a ”money"player and want-

ed the ball in pressure situations,

as evidenced by a February 22
game against Robert Morris Col-

lege at the Sewall Center. Down
by three, 74-71, with under :20
seconds to play, Johnson
launched a three-pointer to send
the game to overtime and an
eventual 85-84 Lady Panther
victory.

Johnson came on strong as the
season progressed, scoring in the
double figures for 1 7 consecutive
games and helping the Lady Pan-
thers advance past the first round
of the Big East Women's Cham-
pionship Tournament since the
’84 season.

1 Perhaps Johnson's most telling
attribute is her persistence. She
was sidelined with knee surgery
after a stellar senior season in
high school in 1985-86.in which
she scored 29 points per game.
Although she had recurring knee
problems and gained weight dur-
ing her year-and-a-half period of
inactivity, Johnson worked con-
tinually to rehabilitate her
damaged knee and further de-
velop her game, and has since
become the Lady Panthers’ most
durable and consistent performer.

Johnson believes that she still
has to work to do, though. She
hasset numerous goals for next
season, including playing without
a leg brace she wore all last year,
further strengthening her leg, and
playing at least thirty minutes ev-
ery game.

Coach of the Year
Mike Gottfried

Gottfried came to Pitt before
the 1986 season and in. two

years, he has been able to guide ,

the Panther football program
towards a new direction.

After finishing 5-5-1 in 1986,
Gottfried pushed the Panthers to
an 8-4 record and an appearance
in the Bluebonnet Bowl — their
first bowl game since 1983.

Along the way, Pitt beat such
national powers as Notre Dame
and Penn State.

”The second year is usually the
toughest for a new coach," Gott-

. fried said. ”You are expected to
pull through. We had a lot of nice
things happen to our ballclub last
season. We are very enthusiastic
about continuing in the right
direction.”

Gottfried is highly regarded in
many coaching circles and his
name is frequently mentioned
when another coaching job
opens up.

One of the biggest things that
Gottfried has been able to offer
the Panthers has been his recruit-
ing skills.

For the second year in a row,
Pitt's is considered one of the best
recruiting classes in the country.

Gottfried has been able to bring
in players such as Curtis Bray -
considered by many the top
scholastic player in the country
last season —- and Mike Cha|en—
ski — Parade All-American and
the most heavily-recruited player
from New Jersey —— to help
rebuild the once-proud Pitt team.

”I think we were able to make
a lot of strides last season," Gott-
fried said. ”I don't think we
turned the corner yet, but we are
coming down the street- We are
close to the corner, though/_’

After that, I knew that he would
someday make it to the finals.”
Winning the championship
was another thing completely.
”Anything can happen that
would hold a wrestler back,"
Richard said. ”Some type of in-
Jury can stop anybody from win-
ning the big one. In fact, Pat was
battling a back injury throughout

the last few weeks of the season. ..

He just kept a positive attitude
and did his work.”

Although Pat is at the top of his
game right now, both father and
son see room for improvement.

”Pat still makes a lot of mis-
takes," Richard said. ”He can al-
ways use a little more strength.
This season he won a lot of
matches because his technique is
so good.

”I believe that Pat should learn
both collegiete and international

style. It will make him a better J

wrestler on the college level and
any other level he chooses to
shoot for.”

’’I can always improve,” Pat
agreed. ”Sometimes I get tired
during matches when I really
shouldn't. I still have a ways to go
before I become as good as I
can.”

With a national championship
behind him, that only leaves the
Olympic gold.

”Pat hasn't really talked that
much about the Olympics,”
Richard said. ”He has had to play
catch up in school because of all
the tournaments and everything.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 18, 1988

A‘ 15

 

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff .Writer

They're calling this, among
NFL draft circles, the Year of the
Wide Receiver, basically because
there are plenty of good’uns
available. Tim Brown (the 1987
Heisman Trophy winner), Ster-

¢’ng Sharpe, Wendell Davis and

Mike Irvin are just a few of the
players who make up ‘ what

THOMAS
DANYLIIK

analysts are calling the best crop
of wideouts in the last 10 years.

But, to the dismay of more than
a handful of National Football
League teams, wide receivers ar-
en't exactly what the doctor or-

Ddered in terms of a sure-fire

prescription for a Super Bowl ti-
tle. Quarterbacks and linebackers

A are the main craze of desire this

year, but there._aren’t but a
hypodermic syringe-full of these
specialists available, and the,qnes
who are aren’t~, anything"’th.at
would inspire cancellation of a
team's yearly checkup.

This is how we expect the first
round_of the April 24th NFL draft
to appear, taking into considera-,
tion each team's needs, depth
and drafting position:

1. Atlanta Falcons — Primary
Needs: Linebacker, Secondary.
Selection: Aundray Bruce, "line-
backer from Auburn". The team
has already inked Bruce, an ex-

, cellent choi’c’é‘ for "d:efense-rs

depleted Atlanta.

'32. Detroit Lions — Primary
Needs: Linebacker, Secondary.
Selection: Benny Blades, defen-

_ sive back from Miami, Fla. The

Lions’ defensive backfield is one

of the worst in the league; they _

are also desperate, as they
stooped down and traded for
former Steeler unfavorite Harygy
Clayton.’  '

3. Kansas City Chiefs -
Primary Needs: Linebacker,
Quarterback. Selection: Neil
Smith, defensive end from
Nebraska. Smith is an excellent
pass rusher with 4.46 speed.
Smith is more talented than any
linebacker available.

4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers —
Primary Needs: Running Back,
Wide Receiver. Selection: Craig
Heyward, running back from
Pittsburgh. The Buccaneers could
use some offensive firepower to
take the heat off QB Vinny
Testaverde and the overused (and
oft—injured) RB James Wilder.
Heyward is a monster.

5. Cincinnati Bengals -
Primary Needs: Defensive Line,
Secondary. Selection: Ricky Dix-
on, defensive back from Oklaho-
ma. Dixon is a ferocious hitter
with excellent (4.35) speed.
Remember how the Bengals lost
to San Francisco last year on that
last—second Hail Mary fling to Jer-
ry Rice? Wouldn't have hap-
penedwith Dixon back there.

6. Los Angeles Raiders -1

Primary; Needs: Quarterback,

Secondary. Selection: Kellygi
Stouffer,‘ quarterback from "

Colorado State. Stouffer played
hardball with St. Louis Cardinals’
negotiators this past year and has
re-entered the draft. The Raiders
have needed stability at quarter-
back since the Super Bowl year
of 1983.

7. Green Bay Packers —

= Primary 1 Needs: Quarterback,
‘%Offensive Line. Selection: Paul
-»Gruberv,..offensive lineman from

Wisconsin. The Pack needs fire-
power up front to free last year's
first-round pick, . running back

Brent Fullwood. A ‘quarterback A

would bethe wisest choice for
Green Bay, but none are to be
found. 1

8. New York Jets —- Primary
Needs: Defensive Line, Offensive

‘Line. Selection: Scott Davis,
 defensive lineman from lllinogissg

Davis is a 6-foot-7, 265-pounder
who must take up the slack for
the waived Joe Klecko and the
slipping Mark Gastineau.

9. Houston Oilers (from the LA
Rams) —- Primary Needs: Line-
backer, Tight End. Selection:
Keith Jackson, tight end from Ok-
lahoma. Jackson should replace
the disappointing Jamie Williams
in the lineup, which shouldn't
upset Jackson; Williams played
his college ball at much—hated
Nebraska.

10. New York Giants -
Primary Needs: Wide Receiver,
Secondary. Selection: Tim
Brown, wide receiver from Notre
Dame. Being the Heisman
Trophy winner won't help Brown
go any higher in the draft. The
glut of wide receivers this year
makes him a not-so-rare com-
modity.

11. Dallas Cowboys — Primary
Needs: Offensive Line, Wide
Receiver. Selection: John Elliot,
offensive lineman from Michigan.
Cowboys are desperate ‘for

receivers, but Elliot is too good to 1

pass up. Dallas will hope that
good receivers will be available
in later rounds.

12. Phoenix Cardinals —
Primary Needs: Running Back,
Defensive Line. Selection: Dan
Stubbs, defensive lineman from
Miami, Fla. For once, maybe the
Cards won't embarrass them-
selves on draft day. Stubbs should
complement David Galloway
and Bubba Baker well.

13. Philadelphia Eagles ——
Primary Needs: Offensive Line,
Secondary.‘ Selection: Randall
McDaniel, offensive lineman
from Arizona State. Philly will
need this Randall to keep its other
Randall (QB Cunningham) off his
back. The bust first—round selec-
tion of OL Kevin Allen is hurting
in the long run. McDaniel is con-
sidered one of the best athletes
available.

14. Los Angeles Rams (from
Buffalo) — Primary Needs: Run-
ning Back, Offensive Line. Selec-
tionl:>“Lorenzo White, running
back‘ from Michigan State. ‘The

Rams dealt away both Eric Dic'k- ‘

.N FL first—round picks could be interesting

erson and Barry Redden in the
same season, and relied on the
aging Charles White to carry the
load. White, talent-wise, can
prove to be the best running back
in the draft.

15. San Diego Charger -
Primary Needs: Quarterback,
Wide Receivers. Selection: Ster-
ling Sharpe, wide receiver from
South Carolina. The Chargers will

‘ be elated if Sharpe is still availa-

ble at this point. Some feel he
may be better than Brown at the
position. Trumaine Johnson has
done nothing for San Diego since
joining the team from the USFL.

16. Miami Dolphins — Primary
Needs: Offensive Line, Secon-
dary. Selectionz Gary Johnson,
offensive lineman from Oklaho-
ma. Potential loss of all—pro
center Dwight Stephenson could
devastate the team. Dolphins’
secondary is porous and slow,
but lower picks could fill that
void.»Protection of QB Marina is
a must.

Panther track teams find success

* at Dogwood Relays in Knoxville

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's and women's
track teams spent last weekend in
Knoxville, Tenn. at the Dogwood
Relays.

Victorious performances for the

9 Panthers were turned in by Eric
Cannon in the invitational
110-meter hurdles, and the
shuttle-hurdle relay team of Elbert
Ellis, George lfill, Calvin Holmes
and Cannon.

Cannon was timed at 13.86 in
winning the 110—meter hurdles.
Teammate Ellis (14.36) was
fourth in the event.

The win in the shuttle-hurdle
relay marked the third-straight
year the Panthers have taken top

honors in the event, clocking in

at 57.01.

Ellis showed well in the
400—meter intermediate hurdles,
finishing third in a time of 51.03.

The Lady Panthers provided
some thrills of their own in tak-

    

ing runner—up honors in the mile
relay. The Pitt women's time of
3:41.16 was only two seconds off
of NCAA qualifying time in the
event, placing them second to
East Michigan.

Keisha Demas finished fourth
in the 400—meter dash for the
Lady Panthers, only to discover at
the finish line that she had been
disqualified for a lane violation.

There were a number of strong
performances for Pitt that didn't
receive the recognition they nor-
mally would, due to the heavy
competition at the meet.

For the men, Joel Ninos
(9:13.07) and the sprint medley
team of Cannon, Rowan Mighty,
Ellis and Tom Boggan (3:21.86)
finished fifth.

In the open 100-meter dash,
Terry Wellman was clocked in at
11.10, finishing seventh.

The Lady Panthers turned in
some fine times that did not earn
the respect they would seem to
merit. Ardythe Hope finished

seventh in the 400-meter dash
with a time of 57.17. The Pitt
women's 400—meter relay team
ran a 47.01, finishing seventh.

In the 800—meter trials, Pitt
received top—notch performances
from Gloria Azeke (2213.51), Ca-
thy Chrissos (2:16.37) and Robin
Hubauer (2:19).

The Lady Panthers got a strong
performance from Valerie Reed
in the shot put. Her throw was
measured at 38-feet-10 inches.

Weather ‘ conditions put a
damper on the meet. It rained on
Friday and even though it didn't
on Saturday, the conditions were
hardly conducive to top perfor-
mances.

The meet featured one of the
strongest fields in the outdoor
collegiate season to date. includ-
ed in the field were many teams
from the Big Ten, Southeastern,

‘ Big East, Atlantic Ten and Atlan-

tic Coast Conferences.

The Pitt men's and women's
track teams did not dominate the
competition like they did at the
Panther Relays, but the competi-
tion at the Dogwood Relays
should pay dividends in the
future. V

Disappointing
Team of the Year

M e n ' s
Basketball

The Pitt basketball team was
expected to challenge for the na-
tional championship this season.
They were ranked in the top 10
all year long. Center Charles
Smith was named Big East Play-
er of the Year. Sean Miller was
Big East Freshman of the Year.
Bobby Martin, Jason Matthews
and Miller were all named to the
Big East All—Freshman team.

They finished the season with

E a very good 24-7 overall record

and 12-4 in the Big East —— good
enough to win the regular-season
championship.

Not to take anything away from
coach Paul Evans and his squad,
but a team with that much talent
should have done much more.

In the Big East tournament, Pitt
lost at second-round game to Vil-
lanova, a team with no recruits at
the start of the season. Villanova,
however, was a team with

     

  

I1

enough heart to carry them past
those with much more talent,
something that the Panthers
lacked, which caused their
downfall.

The NCAA Tournament led to
another disappointment. The
Panthers were a number—two
seed in the Midwest region. A
region that wasn't really that
tough to get through. Pitt folded
in the second round to Vander-
bilt, someone the Panthers could
have beaten with relative ease if
they put their minds to it.

When the season ended, many
fans were left out in the cold,
wondering where their team had
gone wrong.

Draft

Continued from page 15

17. New England Patriots —
Primary Needs: Running Back,
Defensive Line. Selection: Brad
Muster, running back from Stan-
ford. The Pats need new blood in
the backfield, as Craig James,
Mosi Tatupu, Robert Weathers
and Tony Collins have stagnated
the position for years. Reggie
Dupard, a RB picked in the first-
round two years ago, has been a
disappointment so far.

18. Pittsburgh Steelers_ -
Primary Needs: Quarterback,
Wide Receiver.‘ Selection:
Michael Irvin, wide receiver from
Miami, Fla. Steelers lost WRs
John Stallworth and Calvin
Sweeney during the off-season.
Former all-pro Louis Lipps has
struggled with injuries and hasn't
been the same since 1985. Irvin
is a prime-timer. Now the Steel-
ers only need a quarterback to get
the ball to him. —
‘ 19. Minnesota Vikings -
Primary Needs: Offensive Line,
Linebacker. Selection: Chris
Speilman, linebacker from Ohio
State. Speilman’s performance
supposedly slipped during his
senior year with the Buckeyes,
and so has his status with pro
scouts. Could be a victim of over-
scouting, as were former Miami
Dolphins’ picks Dan Marino and
LB John Offerdahl.

20. Los Angeles Rams (from In-

 

 

 

Minimum time: 1 hour

dianapolis) — Primary Needs:
Running Back, Offensive Line.
Selection: Mark Hutson, offensive
lineman from Oklahoma. The
Rams drafted poorly in 1987.
Hutson is‘ almost a must for a
team's aging offensive line that,
aside from third-year man Tom
Newberry, averages 12 years ex-
perience.

21. Houston Oilers -- Primary
Needs: Linebacker, Secondary.
Selection: Chris Chandler, quar-
terback from Washington. The
Oilers need a backup to QB War-
ren Moon now, as well as an heir
apparent to the 11-year (five in
the NFL) veteran. Chandler is
highly similar to Dallas’ Steve
Pelleur, also a Washington grad.

22. Cleveland Browns Primary
Needs: Defensive Line, Wide
Receiver. Selection: Wendell Da-
vis, wide receiver from LSU. A
solid team overall, the Browns
need a downfield threat to com-
plement speedster Webster
Slaughter and possession-man
Brian Brennan.

23. Chicago Bears —— Primary
Needs: Linebacker, Wide
Receiver. Selection: Fred Strick-
land, linebacker from Purdue.
The Bears need to ease the loss
of free agent Wilber Marshall to
the Washington Redskins. At
6-foot-2‘/2, 241-pounds, Strick-
land could be the bruiser Chica-
go has been missing in recent

drafts.

24. New Orleans —- Primary
Needs: Wide Receiver, Secon-
dary. Selection: Kevin Porter,
defensive back from Auburn. The
loss of safety Antonio Gibson to

injury hurt the Saints tremendous-I

ly last year: the Saints were then
bombed through the air by Min-
nesota in the playoffs. Porter is
considered by many as the
second-rated safety available be-
hind Blades.

25. San Francisco 49ers -
Primary Needs: Linebacker,
Wide Receiver. Selection: Mar-
cus Cotton, linebacker from USC.
The 49ers could use a WR to
complement all-pro Jerry Rice
and replace the aging and injured
Dwight Clark, but, as the team
found out in the playoffs, their
linebacking is not nearly up to
par.

26. Denver Broncos — Primary
Needs: Secondary, Runni_ng
Backs. Selection: Terence
McDonald, defensive back from
Tennessee. Denver has been ab-
solutely massacred in the secon-
dary during the‘ last two Super
Bowls. Enough is enough, coach
Dan Reeves is thinking.

27. Chicago Bears (From
Washington) -— Primary Needs:
Linebacker, Wide Receiver.
Selection: J.R. Ambrose, wide
receiver from Mississippi.

TOO BAD SHE DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  

Too bad she didrit know that 9 out of 10 sex—
ually active women, not using contraception,
will be pregnant by the end of one year."‘

That includes those who thought
it was a “safe” time of the month,
who didn’t want to ruin the moment,
didritwant to see a doctor.

And those relying on the effec—
tiveness of a last minute prayer.

If you could ima ine a method
of contraception wigxout the
interruption of the diaphragm.

the mandatory office visit required by the Fill,
and the mess of some other methods, you
might be able to imagine using

 ‘ it. Consistently.

The Today” Contraceptive

r Sponge.The safe, effective, over-
the—counter contraceptive that
doesnt get in the way of your.
love life. »

Use it. Because birth control
is more than just a really
good idea. Its a fact of life.
