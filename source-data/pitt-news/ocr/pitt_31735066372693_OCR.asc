Report Supports G

By FREDERICK BEERS

For members of Pitt's geography
department, Friday was a day to
rejoice.

They had received the report of a
special faculty evaluating commit-
tee that is recommending that the
department not be terminated, but
that it be retained and that “reor-
ganization and revitalization be
undertaken with great speed."

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) Deanxlerome L. Rosenberg
has twice advanced proposals for
termination of the department
since 1977.

.Ulii: iﬂitt N 21115

The report is strictly advisory.
The dean has the final word on the
fate of the department. Rosenberg
said he has the report “under
study."

Department chairman Hibberd
V.B. Kline said the department is
“delighted“ with the report. He
termed it a “clear and unequivocal
statement in support of the depart-
ment." Kline said he believes the
report will “carry a lot of weight."

Specifically. the committee
recommends that the department
concentrate on urban geography,
environmental studies and spatial
analysis, which includes cato-
grapliy. computer graphics,

It also recommends a faculty of
nine: three urban geographers;
three environmental geographers,
an applied climatologist, applied
geomorphologist and a specialist
in environmental policy and natu-
ral resource management; two cul-
tural geographers; and a spatial
analysis specialist.

The committee further recom-
mends that the dean reopen disctis-
sions with Edward K. Muller of
history and urban studies about
chairing the department.

tees began studying the value of
retaining geography at Pitt. Both
committees concluded that geo-
graphy plays an important role at
the university and that the depart-
ment should be revitalized and that
a new chairman be named.

The dean took up the task of car-
rying otit these recommendations
and convened a search committee

didates were interviewed and three

were offered the chair, but all

GPSA Move

By LAURIE MACLEOD

The Student Government
Board (SGB) endorsed the
Graduate Professional Student
Association’s (GPSA) buying

- into the Pitt Program Council
at Friday’s meeting.

SGB President Todd DeLuca
said GPSA is trying to rebuild
its student government and
make something of its activities
fee, but will have no effect on
undergraduate students.

According to the plan, GPSA
will pick up the difference
between what the graduate stu-
dents will pay at the door and
what they would usually pay.

In other business, DeLuca
predicted that the allocation
process would be difficult, but
noted that SGB would take the
entire student body into coiisi(l-
eration before making a
decision.

“This year's allocation pro-
cess will be a hard one. bin the
Student Government Board
will make decisions using the
priority of events with the entire
scope of students in mind," said
Del.uca.

Prof Predictswitch-Hunt

By GARY SIMONE

The news media may be the sub-
ject of a McCarthy-style witch-
hunt in the near future, according
to Speech professor. Robert
Newman.

Speaking at a University Honors
Program lecture Thursday, New-
man said that a hard-core group of
conspiracy devotees did not disap-
pear when Senator Joe McCarthy
fell. He said they were neglected by
the press, which deemed them no
longer newsworthy.

“Anybody that was surprised
when the Moral Majority appeared
on the horizon was naive. These
people were always there; they just
are not always news," he said.

Newman said that 15-20 percent
of the electorate ‘Were strong
McCarthy and Goldwater support-
ers. He added that, in the 1964 elec-
tron, Goldwater received more
than 20 percent of the vote, which
indicated that more people were
converted.

“ .\ly hard-core 20 percent, which
includes some of the Moral Major-
ity, is poised and waiting, as it
always has been, for a new oppor-
tunity ()l‘ traumatic event that will
bring it a flood of converts," he
said.

"I take the position that we can
expect another round of scapegoat-
ing." Newman said. According to
Newinan, witch-hiiiiting is a cycli-

cal phenomenon, and while each
repetition is different, another
round may arise in five to seven
years. \

Newman said that three out of
four components necessary for the
revival of scapegoating are con-
spicuously present and the fourth
can occur at anytime.

“First, there has to be a substan-
tial segment of the populace under-
going status strain,” Newman said’.
He added that this segment consists
of those fearful of losing benefits or
prestige and is usually accompan-
ied by economic strain.

Newman said that evidence of
economic strain is visible in today's
unemployment figures, high inter-
est rates and the cutbacks affecting
welfare recipients.

“Reaganomics has yet to estab-
lish its ability to deal with these
things. There is widespread unease
and displeasure," Newman said.

A second component is that
“there have to be political or spirit-
ual traumas," he said. Examples,
he said. are riots. strikes, Iran and
iio-wiii wars, the most painful of
which was Vietnam.

“The jury is not in on Vietnam.
The wounds have not healed. and
that del)acle lies like an unex-
ploded hoinl) under the surface of
American society." he said.

A suitable scapegoat is the third
coiiiponetit, he said. According to
Newman that scapegoat. as in the
.305. will be the Soviet Union.

“Communism is still a potent
symbol. The Soviet Union is still
behind the most lethal challenges
to our virile self-image,” he sa-id.

Newman said that scapegoating
is not working today as it did in the
505. During the McCarthy. era,
Soviet malevolence was connected
with the state department, he said.

The new trend of Soviet malevo-
lence was first pointed out by Spiro
Agnew in .his‘ar;iti-media speech,
according to Newman.-

— “Now a su-bsta-ntial body of
Americans believe that the republic
is being subverted by a disloyal

press," he said. “They believe that‘

the pro-Soviet bias of the media has
poisoned the minds of naive citi-
zens and rendered them helpless
before our enemies. -

“Here the interests of the anti-
communists and the goals of the
Moral Majority coincide. It is pre-
cisely the ainorality of a liberal
press which allows filth, hedonism
and atheism. all hallmarks of Bol-
shevism, to penetrate the American
home.

“If the distant is the Krenilin. the
proximate enemy is the media to do
the Kremlin‘s will," he said.

The fourth component is the
need for deinagogues. which New-
man said are the new religious rites
and the disinformation cults.

The Allocations Committee
represented the Resident Stu-
dent Association’s emergency
request to SGB, recommending
40 percent funding of the
"Spring Fling.”

SGB again rejected the
recommendation, hoping to
fund the event 100 percent, and
now has two weeks to restruc-
ture the budget.

RSA representative Ken Beu-
tow said the “Spring Fling” is a
good, solid program and would
be severely damaged if not
funded 100 percent.

“It’s the duty of SGB to be
just to all students, and funding
RSA‘s event 100 percent would

ers,” said Allocations Commit-
tee chairman Bob Colosimo.
Colosimo said changing the
40 percent policy for RSA
would give them an advantage

not be fair and equitable to oth-

when they didn‘t originally
include the program in their
budget.

RSA representative Joe
Simoni said it’s difficult to
budget programs at the begin-
ning of the year because things
change and this is their reason
for the emergency request.

Greek" Week requested a ‘*4
page, 1/2 page and full page ad for
making students aware of
“Greek Sing," a Greek Week
event.

SGB accepted the ‘/4 and ‘/2
page ads with the stipulation
that emergency request for a
full page ad could be made at a
later date.

SGB also accepted funding
the Studio Theater’s seventh
show and the Student Relation
Committee's “Student Recog-
nition Dinner.”

SGB rejected funding the
College of Young Democrats‘

conference.

Colosiino said it wasn't really
a conference, btit instead a
training school for campaign-
ing for Democratic candidates,
and Allocation's policy does
not permit the funding of polit-
ical events.

SGB agreed to grant funds for
board members Rebecca Vero-
nis and Greg Powers to attend

“Disinformation is a code-word
which is replacing treason as the
label for Kremlin penetration of
American society,"jhe said. A clas-
sic exposition of the disinforma-
tion idea is in the novel TIteSpike
by Robert Moss and Arinaud de
Borchgrave, he added.

The Spike is the bible of the new
disitiforniatioii crusade which con-
trols the columns of the i'\"('uv York
Times and the ll’a.s‘I1z'ngton I’().sZ,
he said. The crusade has a newslet-
ter called Accuruc_y in the Media
Report, which is now attacking top
journalists and is supported by
Richard iVIellon-Scaife among oth-
ers, Newman said.

According to Newman. disinf_or—
mation consists of: the press kill—.
ing stories which reflect unfavora-.
ably upon the Soviet Union or
printing favorable stories which
will lead Americans to think that
the Soviets are peace-loving, arm
themselves for defense reasons and

do not control Cuban or Vietnam-
ese communists.

“Believeing these things, Ameri-
cans will be disarmed psychologi-
cally and the Soviets could take
over the world without" firitig a

shot," he said.

Newman questioned the idea of
American journalists being oti ll‘:-.».
payroll of the Kremlin or beirig 

blackmailed by the Soviets. He also
cited the fact that de Borchgrave
nas not nameu a single American
journalist being held captive by the
KGB.
deBorchgravc has an alarmist
view of conspiracy between Ameri-
cati journalists and the KGB,"
l\’cwniati said.

Newiiian added that de B()l‘(‘1t-
grave says that society at large is in
worse shape than the journalists.
in that it is riddled with spies. De
Borcligrave says that if the (LIA and
FBI were fortified and put to work‘: 
1,000 cases of espionage in this 
country could be cracked, Newman
said.

“ll. espionage were really this
massive, surely the Russians by this
time would have learned how to
raise wheat atid corn.” he said.

According to Newman, it is
unknown if a trauma similar to the
Korean War, which set off witch-
litiritirig in the 50s, will occur
today.

"Btu watch, something will
happen sometime," he said.

DOCTOR OF OPTOMETRY ALWAYS IN ATTENDANCE

 

Fred Koloc , CAS Advising Center

(3%

Director  

Fred Koloc

 admitted.

By BiLL HESS

“I do what I do to prevent

I other people front making the

mistakes I made,’ says Fred
Koloc. director of Pitt's College
of Arts and Sciences Advising
Center. “I don’t feel I got the
most out of my undergraduate
education because I didn’t get
the advising I needed."

Koloc, a graduate of Brown
University, has worked in Pitt's
advising department since I966
and has served as director of
advising in the College of Arts
and Science since I970.

“Working with both students
and other advisors" is what
Koloc claims is his career’s
greatest reward.

“An administrator can be a
human being, and I like both
students and-advisors to realize
this,” he said. “We also try to
help students pick courses that
will teach them to live a life as
well as mak'e a living.”

Koloc claims that his philos-
ophy about education isn't all
that different from that of most
administrators. However, he
says, his philosophy about
administration in general is
fairly unique, and he tries to
mold the advising center to fit
his beliefs.

“I look at applicants for advi-
sor positions to see if they agree
with my belief that administra-
tion should be human,” he said,
adding that an applicant must
like to work with other people.

“Of course, it’s possible to be
fooled in an interview," he
“Every once in
awhile we hire someone who
becomes a bit of a problem.”

The biggest problem with the

center now, he says, is the
I changes it is facing.

“We‘ve basically accepted the
fact that we won’t be getting
any more money from the uni-
versity. The number of advisors
on our staff had been declining
by about one or two a year for
awhile, but last year they cut
our staff from 35 advisors to
28."

The center “struggled” to
make it through last year, he
said, by using members of the
faculty as advisors. However, he
feels that drastic changes will
undoubtedly be necessary in the
future. '

“There are three different
possibilities we have’ to look
into, but none of them will
cover the same territory that our
current system can.”

The first possibility, he said,
would be to rearrange the center

«entirely, so that instead of indi-
vidual appointments, group
advising and registration meet-
ings would be used to relieve the
congestion of the current
system.

“The potential of individual
advising is much greater,”
Koloc said, “but we're not sure
we can continue this with our
current resources.”

Getting outside help from
departmental advisors is the
second possible answer to the
center’s problems, Koloc said.

“If the separate departments
could help with the freshman
and sophomores, instead of
only juniors and seniors, a lot of
our overcrowding would be
reduced. One way we could do
this would be to let students
declare majors after their fresh-

,, man vear."

“However,” he added, “most

freshman probably aren't _sure
what they wantto major in.”
Another problem with this
solution, said Koloc, is that
some departments have more
students than others.
“To eliminate that problem,

' we'd have to ask advisors from

one department to help=with
students from another. It might
not be that difficult, though, for
an advisor from something like
sociology to help with a student
majoring in history. As long as
the departments were similar,
there might not be too many
problems.”

The third possibility Koloc
mentioned would be to train
faculty member to be advisors.

“We tried that this year,_with
ten faculty members working
with students who hadn’t
declared majors yet, and it
worked fairly well."

However, Koloc said, the
problem with a full-scale sys-
tem such as this would be that
some members might not really
be motivated to help students.

“I’m just guessing, but
maybe two percent of the
faculty members would do a
good job," he said. “Twenty-
five percent would do a lousy
job because of_1ack of interest.”

If the university decides to
eliminate the center entirely,
Koloc said, the end result would
be chaos. \‘

“The responsibility of advis-
ing would fall square on the
faculty. Without sounding
chauvinistic, I honestly don’t
think they could offer the same
services that we do.”

City Adds A New Dimension

With Pittsburgh Comedyclub

By ANN WALKER

Most major cities have them,
including Los Angeles and
New York, so it’s only natural

.for Pittsburgh to gain the fun
and excitement of a comedy
club.

The Pittsburgh Comedy
Club is owned by four young
ambitious men who turned fan-
tasy into reality.

“I've always wanted to open a
night club, and it’s my nature to
be‘ silly, so a comedy club was
the perfect idea,” Bruno Schir-
ripa said of his dream.

The four members of Yinz
Guze Inc. who own the club,
include Schirripa, Joe Palmi-
sano, Jeff Herforth and Ron
Paulisko. The idea for the club

came while the four were
"shooting the breeze and
dreaming."

Although they have had to
deal with two years of financial
and location problems, in the
five months they've been open
they have had full houses and
packed audiences. Most of the
comics performing at the club
are young amateurs who are rel-
atively unknown but have had
national exposure.

“We treat the comics like
family; that’s why they enjoy
coming to» the club. We pick
them up at the airport and pro-
vide-a condominium for them
while they’re here in Pitts-
burgh. Show biz is a rushed.
sometimes impersonal busi-

ness, and we here at the club like
to make the comics feel wel-
comed and relaxed,” Schirripa
said.

the club has been rated the
top club in the country by other
owners and comedians across
the nation. What makes the
place so popular is that it pro-
vides the nicest showroom.
friendly treatment and a classy
atmosphere, according to
Schirripa.

“Most comedy clubs have a
dive-type atmosphere, but we
decided to provide a more classy
club for our audiences in Pitts-
burgh. It seems to be working
incredibly well; the phone has
been ringing off the hook for
reservations, Schirripa added.

Another, reason comedians
like coming to Pittsburgh is
that the audiences here are
“hot," meaning quick and
responsive. The comedy ranges
from zany to straight stand-up
comedy. Well-known comedi-
ans like Pat Paulson and
jimmy Walker also‘ perform at
the club, but it is mostly for new
comics trying to make it to the
top.

Tuesday night is amateur
night, which offers motivation
for young comics. Club
members teach those comedians
who show potential during
amateur night to better their act
through critiques of perfor-
mances, exposure and material.

“There are two comedians
who performed at the club and
have done well here as well as
on the Ohio and New York cir-
cuit. Randy Lubas, a New
Yorker who emcees for the club
is doing great on his tour in
Ohio, while Tom Anzalone is
on a two-week tour in New
York and has plans for produc-

__ing an album with backing

from Yinz Guze Inc. In the
beginning, we had to go to

other clubs for bookings, and
now, comics are calling us .
wanting to perform at the "
club," Schirripa said.

An evening's show consists of
the emcee performing, then an
opening act, followed by the
headlining act featuring a
comedian from New York or
Los Angeles. The club provides
a full dinner menu served in
two cozy dining rooms adjacent
to the showroom.

“Our cover charges pay for
the comics, 33 Wednesday, $4
Thursday, 355 Friday and Sitti-
day and $6 on Saturday." ScIiir-
ripa said.

Yinz Guze Inc. has furher
plans for club openings in
Ohio, Texas and Kentucky.
The comedy club is doing so
well that thev’ve done in five
months what other businesses
have accomplished in a year
and a half. according to
Schirripa. '

Putting comedy into a wine
and dine atmosphere provides
the pertect setting tor an even-
ing of entertainment-—-at the
Pittsburgh Comedy Club.

Report Recommends Keeping Geography Dept.

the department retused, holding
out for a “geographer of national
renown” as they had been
promised.

The dean then suggested either
naming a chairman from within or
forming a merger with another
department.

The department met with
Muller and this time recommended
that he be appointed. The dean,
however, refused the rec-
ommendation.

Kline filed a statement with the
Senate Budget Policies Committee
claiming that Rosenberg was sub-

But the dean followed with
another termination proposal, and
two more committees were
assigned the task of evaluating the
proposals and geography’s value to
the university.

Meanwhile, the department sub-
mitted an alternative to termina-
tion, which included naming
Muller as chairman and limiting
the scope of the department to
urban geography and environmen-
tal studies. It also recommended

recommended that geography be
retained and restructured along the
lines of the department’s alterna-

recommendation on the budgetary
feasibility of the plan.

‘The latest committee, the Ad
Hoc Committee for Geography,
sees the “potential benefits of this
course of action (revamping the
department) as far outweighing the
costs,” according tothe report. It

found that budget constraints do

not justify the termination of the

“In the rapidly changing envi-

discipline of geography is... essen-
tial." It states that because of geo-
graphy’s unique" focus in problems
relating to the human condition,
“a major university cannot afford
to neglect the questions that geo-
graphers alone consider.” The
report also notes that geography’s
perspective is “underlined in the

The committee recognizes that~$'

“belt-tightening will be neces-
sary." but argues that when
approaches in relation to the “edu-

cational mission of the university
as a whole,” termination of geo-
graphy would “not be in the best
interest of FAS.”

The committee also notes that it
believes “restructuring should be
carried out even at the cost of
budgetary cuts elsewhere in the
university."

The report concludes that
“prompt action is necessary for the
good of the department, the
Faculty and Arts and Sciences and
the university"."

Black Action Society Honors The Prometheans

By SAVONA BAILEY

- (Editor's note: Savona Bailey
is a member of Pitt’5 Black
Actiony Society and submitted

‘this column as part" of the

group’s contmuing efforts to
commemorate Black Hz'stor_v
Month.)

In February 1977, The
Prometheans Inc. (a non—profit
veterans organization repres-
ented by Nathaniel Stinson (a
past president), Earl L. Ginyard
(chairman of the Special Pro-
jects Committee), Judge Luke
C. Moore and John O.
Plummer, Jr. met with Dr: Vin-
cent Reed, Superintendent of
the Washington, D.C. Public
Schools. The group discussed a
proposal designed to supple-
ment efforts being made by
school administrators to alle-
viate the student dropout rate
and to provide information on
‘non-traditional and traditional

career opportunities.

The proposal—-comprised of
two major programs, "Project
Concern" and “Career
Awareness"—-was approved for
implementation by Reed. who
in turn assigned two top staff
members to work with The
Prometheans to put the pro-
grams into effect in the school
system.

The Prometheans-——named
after the Greek god Prome-
theus, who gave people light
and knowledge and who was
punished for his deed--came
about as a result of promises
made and kept by a young black
92nd Division of combat soii"
diers as they fought together on
foreign soil in World War 11.

At least 14 of the warriors
were killed in action, and mem-
ory of the soldiers, The Prome-
theans dedicated themselves to
the premise that they had not

died in vain. The veterans who
returned after the war from
their "baptism of fire” were
determined to unite in a formal
organization. Thus the Prome-
theans came into being.

The goal of the organization
is to promote civic improve-
ment through participation in
fields «of education, health.
charity and especially youth
activities. The Prometheans are
providing scholarships,“ medi-
cal and technical assistance,
and in some instances, youth
counseling on‘ a one-on-one
basis. All of these services were
developed through the utiliza-
tion of professional technical
training, civilian education and
experience of the men who
comprise the membership of
The Prometheans. ‘

The Prometheans observed
its 36th anniversary last year.
Many of its members are suc-

Vs

cessful professional men. They
encompass many professions——
such as medicine, science. edu-
cation, engineering, archi-
tecture. l)tlSlnt‘Ss. law and
politics. The life story of any or
all of the mernbers of The
Prornetheans can be used to
illustrate that minorities with
remarkable skills. determina-
tion and purposeful life goals
can succeed. They can also serve
as further evidence that young’
blacks today.‘ must cultivate
these skills with a good basic
education to get a chance at
interesting work, at good pay
with a promise of steady
employment. ‘

In order to achieve its objec-
tives, The Prometheans estab-
lished specific goals for the
programs “Career Awareness”
and “Project Concern.”

Objectives of “Career Aware-
ness” are:

Despite all the problem that

A» a. he is currently faced with. Koloc

seeins to enjoy his career. He
cites two experiences that are
most ineinorable to him.
“About three or four years
ago I was crossing Fifth Avenue
by (Ilapp Hall, and right in the
middle of the street a woman
stopped me and said she was on
her way to her P.D. defense. She
told me that a conversation
we’d had when she was an
undergraduate had changed her
life. I didn't remember her at
first, but then I recalled that
she'd been confused over what

“she wanted to major in. She’d

been interested in psychology,
so I’d just suggested that she go
over and speak with the educa-
tional psychology department.

“It was only a hunch at the
time on my part, but she went
through with it and got her

A secoiid e\'perience Koloc
recalls ll]\’0l\'('(l a l)lit(‘l\' student
who hadbeen trying to get into
“I1.§’l!l<‘eriiig school.

“ Ihis was one of those
inoinents when all racial ten-
sions just disappear. The stu-
(lent had an extremely poor

was struggling through diffi-
cult math courses when he came
up to see me. Again on a hunch,
I suggested that he take a few
sociology courses, and he even-
tually ended up majoring in it,

“A few years later I ran into
him again, and he said some-
thing to me I’ll never forget. He
said, ‘If it weren't for you, I
wouldn’t be where I am. You're
the father I never had.”'

Policy

If it can be accomplished, the proposal that graduate
students be admitted to Pitt Program Council (PPC)
evetits for the same price as undergraduates would be
smart policy for both the graduate students and the PPC.

In the meantime, however, there are a lot of questions
that will have to be answered and a lot of steps that will
have to be taken before any such agreement can become
permanent. ‘

The first thing to do is to determine how many graduate
students actually attend PPC events. If, after a survey
reveals that there are in fact very few graduate students
attending PPC events, then it probably wouldn’t be worth
anyone’s time or effort to change the present arrangement,
in which graduate students pay full price. If, on the other
hand, a large amount of’ graduate students are attending
the even_ts, then the least that should be done is to make the
price these students pay equitable with that paid by under-
graduates and College of General Studies students.

There is also a question of how the graduate students
should pay into the PPC’s programming budget. If there
aren't very many graduate students attending the events,
then it should be left up to the Graduate and Professional
Student Association (GPSA) to pick up the difference
between what the students would pay at the reduced prices
and what they normally would pay. But if a survey reveals
that a large amount of graduate students are attenditig the
events, then the only fair solution would be to make the
GPSA pay into the PPC budget on a bulk-payment basis
similar to that between the PPC and the College St Gen-
eral Studies. -

The problem with the latter arrangement, however, is
that it takes a lot of cash to make it work——cash that the
GPSAVwould most likelyjhavea hard time finding. Under-

graduates pay an’ activities fee about 30 to 35 percent of _

which goes toward the PPC. The (iGS,‘u‘nder its arrange-

ment, pays about l7.5 percentof its Stude.nt~Govern'meiit '

Council's budget into the"PPC’s budget. That agreement.

_worked out last’ summer, allows CGS_ students to attend

PP(J:events for thesaine pricejas undergraduates.

If the arraVt‘igemei"it is Vaccomplished,:it would be advan-
tageousfor matiy reasons, ‘the most  of which
would be that the PPC would finally have a mandate to
serve all students on Pitt's campus, rather than just under‘-

-gratlttaites and C_G-S. students. Part of ‘the arrangement

between PPC and CCS specifies -that general studies stu-

dents are permitted to have a hand in programming while ,
not being allowed to serve as PP.Ccominittee chairper-, I

sons. With the expertiseaiid experience of graduate stu-

deiit"'input itito ~.progratn—m_ing, Pitt stu-dents cou_ld_.be _

assured a greater variety and depth in programming t.ha-n
is currently available. ' I

Another important benefit of the arrangement would
cpme from the reduction in ticketing hassles and other
logistical problems currently‘ experienced by PPC

Dear Professor Cheever:

Thank you for your thoughtful
letter. Since I agree with almost all
you said, my reply may be brief.

The United Faculty is a deino-
cratic organization whose officers
are elected and whose policies will
be determined by its membership.
It is an z'2tdepe)1(I(’Iit organization
affiliated with the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors
and American ‘Federation of
'I‘eachers. It is not a public school
teachers union. nor is itV an indus-
trial utiion. I.t is a facully unioti.

tion (an area still tiiitoticlied by
President Reagan) and growing
financial stringency.

University policies are no longer
made only in Pittsburgh but also in
Harrisburg and Washington. It is
foolish to believe an individual
professor will have much influence
in these areas.

Our deans, through no fault of
their own, are no longer the leaders
and representatives of the faculty.
They have come to view themselves
as intermediaries and buffers
between the faculty and the
administration.

You make several references to
“salary scales” in your letter. There
are no faculty scalesat the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh for faculty. Your
inference that the present salary
structure is fair, equitable and
based on merit is much disputed.
While isolated individuals may

' have exercised individual leverage‘
with the ‘ad-mittis“tVration to
improve their position, the over-

critical point of mixing factsand
opinions comes in Kearney’s‘open-. ,
ing remarks about whether or not
Reagan is a nice guy. He -misrepres-
ems Ronald Reagan and makes an ~
error. Kearney claims -since Rea-

gan's cuts welfare, social security,

health‘, education, a_nd other vital
programs he.isnot a nice guy. Ear-
lier Kearney said he can believe that
people find Reagan dedicated to
his ideology. Reagan is a radical
turning this country onto a path
not seen in years: Federalism. Rea-

Panthers Whip UMass,
Clinch Homecourt

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

With their competitive juices
simmering for a return matchup
with West Virginia in Morgan-
town on Wednesday, the Pitt
Panthers sleepwalked through a 14
point win over an equally dazed
Massachussetts team, 74-60. °

“lt was a mediocre performance.
We got a lead early and lost our
intensity,” Head Coach Roy Cl1ip-
man said.

“We were tired,” said Dwayne
Wallace, who dished out 9 assists.

Nevertheless, the win clinched
the homecourt for the first round of
the Eastern 8 tournament. Pitt’s

.>~opponent could be Duquesne

Tired is how Pitt played after the
first seven minutes of the contest,
after coming out hard at the young
Minutemen in the beginning,

Lady Panth

By MARIE HUFF

A frustrating season is (oming to

a close for the Pitt Lady Panther
basketball team. The Lady Pan-

thers dropped their fifth straight, a

7l~:3.3 decision to the Ohio State

. Lady Buckeyes, on Saturday night.

The loss plummets Pitt's record to
l«l—l3 with one game remaining.

* A chronic foul problem came
. ‘bit

ck once again to hamper the
Lady Panthers. Pitt seemed too
i anxious. and picked tip five quick
fouls in the opening ininutes of the
contest. The Lady Buckeyes »i(“tl})l-
talized on the situation and with a
pair of buckets eacli from Yvette
Angel and Mary Sivak, built an
i ettrl_y H-3 lead.‘  ,
(Iarol Dugan ‘initiated "a ‘Lady
"Panther surge with an eight-foot
baseline jinnper. Dugan connected
again from Alt) feet out. Lori Lew-
oman hit a pair of free tlirows.
Dugan swished yet another from I8
i feel out. and (iail .~\ughbtn‘ns
dcapped the drive with an inside
.... nove to bring the Lady Panthers
within six 2 M8. That was thetlos-
est Pitt tame to ()hio State (lining

crashing both offensive and defen-
sive boards. The aggressive play,
evidenced ‘by Pitt's halftime
rebounding edge of 21-10, brought
on a ten point lead and a severe
reduction in energy.

Four weeks ‘ago, the Panthers
could have lost a game if their
hearts and minds weren't in it.
Four weeks ago, the team was still
in the process of finding itself. It
seems to have done that——quite
nicely, thank you.

“We’re starting to jell. When I
make a move, and want to dish off,
the guys know what I‘m goingyto
do.” Wallace said.

“The freshmen off the bench are
now starting to know their roles. It
just took awhile," Chipman said.

Wallace's’ slump, which might
in fact have been due to a lack of
communication more than any—
thing else, appears to have passed.

    
   

ontin

The senior point guard is begin-
ning to make the offense flow by
penetrating and creating shots
when none appeared available. In
the past two games, Wallace has
given out 17 assists.

This cohesiveness more than
made up for the lack of intensity.
The game was never really in doubt
as UMass never got closer than six
during the second half. When they
did get it down to six, Boo Kirby
took care of that with an exclama-
tion point. He pinned Donald Rus-
sell’s attempted lay-up and with it
UMass’s hopes.

“It was definitely the turning
point of the game,” UMass Coach
Tom McLaughlin said.

UMass might have won the
game if they hadn't been lackadai-
sical as Pitt, turning the ball over

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
fell to the Clarion State Golden
Eagles 31-8 in their final dual meet
of the season on Saturday.

Seniors Jeff Gordon, Eric Harris,
Jeff Wilps, Glenn Nacion, Mike
Bond and Pat Connors were recog-
nized by the coaches for their dedi-
cation and achievements during
their wrestling careers in a pre-
match ceremony.

There was also a pre—match gath-
ering for the parents of the
wrestlers and new recruits, along
with being high school wrestling
and Greek day at the match.

But with all the festivities, the
Panthers could only pull in two
wins and a tie while giving up a
default, two superiors, one major,
and three decisions.

A big factor in the Panther defeat
was Pitt’s inability to keep the
Eagles from scoring in the final
period, as three Panthers gave up
points in the final seconds in either
losses or ties.

Jamie Kasser got things started
for the Golden Eagles by scoring
four take downs and five nearfalls
on his way to a 25-5 superior deci-
sion over Pitt’s Rich Esswein, at
118 pounds.

At 126 pounds, Panther Joe
Throckmorton went into the third
period with a 7-1 lead over Kraig
Nellis of Clarion, but gave up nine

points in the final period, three of’

which came with I5 seconds left in
the match, to hand Nellis the 10-8
victory.

At 134 pounds, Craig Richey got

. Pitt on the scoreboard by scoring

the first Panther points of the
night; decisioning Bill Arnold 5-1.

A major Panther setback came
when a head injury in the first
period caused Pitt’s Jeff Gordon at
142 pounds to default to Clarions’
Ken Nellis. «»

The Panthers then had to shift
their line-up to accommodate the
absence of Jeff Jelic by moving
senior Glenn Nacion into the 150
pound weight class, and boosting
freshman Doug Haines upto 158
pounds to replace the injured Jelic.

Nacion lost to Clarion’s Scott

Sports Briefs

Are you listening?

Chalk up some recruiting points
for the Pitt basketball coaching
staff, particularly assistant coach
Seth Greenberg, for his lengthy,
glowing diatribe about highly-
coveted recruit Lloyd Moore of
Clairton High School in yester-
dav’s Pittsburgh Press.

Greenberg, in an article by Pat
Livingston, stops just short of cal-
ling Moore, a husky, 6-9 center, the
next coming of Wilt Chamberlain.
Pitt, which is still supposedly in
the running for Moore, along with
Duquesne and Marquette, desper-

ately wants Moore to fill the Pan--

thers’ pressing need for a pivot
man. How desperately?

Consider these ego-builders,
dear reader:

 

0 “With a post player like
Moore, we have an opportunity
within two or three years to win a
national championship."

0 “Take our kids, plus one or
two kids we’re going to recruit, put
a post player with them and we
could play with anyone. That's
what Moore could do for Pitt.”

And finally, Greenberg, playing
the soapbox role ‘to the hilt-
Lloyd, are you listening?-
concluded with a swipe at archrival
Duquesne:

“Put him with Duquesne’s play-
ers, and they graduate everyone,
and he's Bruce Atkins surrounded
by mediocrity. But put him with
our kids, young kids who can really
play, and you’re laying a
corIiet‘stone.’f

Seems Greenberg isn’t above lay-
ing down a few compliments
either.

Gene Larson

', .

 

 
 

By LISA GRENEVICKI

With the addition of Gene Lar— '
son to the Pitt Volleyball Team,
the spikers have become more
versatile—and Larson feels that
he’s gained some freedom.

A transfer from San Bernadino
Valley College in California, Lar-
son made the cross-country move
to Pitt to become a key member of
the Panther men’s volleyball team.

Larson has always been involved
with many sports—including base-
ball, long-distance running and‘
now volleyball.

“I’ve always been active in what-
ever is most convenient,” said Lar-
son. “Volleyball is my favorite
sport. It’s what I’m doing now.”

Larson, a native of Silverdale,
Washington, didn’t become
involved in volleyball until he sat
in on a practice at Washington
State University during his fresh-
man year there. .

Dave Mercer, WSU’s volleyball
club coach, saw the potential of
Larson’s talent and encouraged
him to go to California. Larson left
WSU after two year for San
Bernadino.

Now, as a member of Pitt Head
Coach Ray Reilly's spikers, Larson
has found a home at the left outside
hitter position.

“My job in Pitt’s offense is to hit
anything that’s outside,”
explained Larson. “Our offense is
designed around the middle, so the
left side hitter doesn’t set as much‘.

“On defense, my job is to cover
the opponent’s strong side hitter.
That’s why my position is often
called the power digger--I'm usu-

New Dimension

   

ally digging the shots of the other
team’s power hitter."

The Panther offense is different
from that of most other teams,
according to Larson, in that it
relies on the spiking strength of its
middle blocker, more than the out-
side hitters. ‘i

But, Larson says, things are
changing.

“Before I came to Pitt, and before
Gary Groshner’ and others
matured, Pitt had no real strong
outside hitters,” said Larson. “We
have the best setter on the East
Coast in Dave Baird, and two good
middle blockers, Bill Knuth and
Brian Devine, so the .offense is
designed around the middle.

“Now that we’re running more
outside plays, our offense is more
varied. ‘Most teams have only one-
fourth the plays we have. It’s.a
more sophisticated offense. It gives
us quickness and the element of
surprise,” Larson said. 4

Larson believes Pitt’s diversified
offense allows him more freedom
as a player. .

“By having the opponent con-
centrating on the middle, it makes
my job easier,” La_rson said. .“It
leaves the outside open more, so
I’m hitting one-on-one with one
blocker or no blockers at all to hit
past.” _

“Having so many plays also help
when we play weaker teams. You
don’t get bored because you’re
always changing the plays,” Lar-.
son said. “You don’t get in a rut,
which often happens to a team."

Pitt Gymnasts Romp,Look to up Scores  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Not that the routol State l'niver-
sity of New York at I‘~2H‘I11lIlg(lLil(‘
and Cortland State College  the
men’s gymnastics team this week-
end wasn’t satisfying, it’s just that
head coach Frank D‘Amico is still
looking for higher goals.

Pitt defeated the two schools in a
triple meet by the incredible score
of 255.l to 196 for Cortland State
and I93 for State University of New
.York at Farmingdale.

“The competition was inferior.
It's not that they didn't have some
strong people but = their depth
wasn’t as good as ours," D’Amico
said.

Indeed, the two teams didn’t pro-
vide much of anything especially
on the sidehorse which Pitt swept.
Joe Femiani took first with team-
mate Nooch Capani behind and
]oe’s brother, Chris Femiani, in
third. The Panthers also swept the
parellel bars as Frank Kratz, Bob
Besong and Joe Femiani placed
one, two, and three respectively.

But the strong showing still was
not up to par with D’Amico
wishes.

“I would like to crack the top
twenty and to do that youghave to
average scores of 258 or better,"
D’Amico said. "Also I would like
to increase each person’s scores by
at least 3/4th of a point a week.”

D’Amico's goals are understand-
able with teams like North Caro-
lina State, WVU and Illinois still
upcoming, and Nationals not too
far ahead.

Freshman

.3-,LaNoue

Sprints to
Easterns

By SEAN BARNES

Just wnen you thought the best A

sprint freestyle team in the East
couldn’t get better, in steps a fresh-
man named Ed LaNoue. Pitt’s

"LaNoue has already established his

 

dominance in freestyle as he goes to
NCAA Eastern Regionals not just
aiming for the Championship
finals, but also for the ultimate
goal in college swimming: the
NCAA Division I National
Championships.

Pitt head coach Fred Lewis’s
Panthers may be hurting in a cou-
ple events for Easterns, but no one
will include the . sprint freestyle
events in that list. With LaNoue
and Pitt’s other freestyle powers,
Rick Carter, Jerry Zaleski, Pete
Doyle and j.D. McCrilIis, Pitt can
safely expect to sweep the 50- and
100-yard freestyle at Iiasterns, based

their times so far, as well as enter
a freestyle relay team destined for
Nationals.

LaNoue has always been a pow-
erful sprinter. He went to the Penn-'
sylvania State YMCA Finals at age
I0 and won three events——the 50-
yard freestyle, the 50-yard breast-
stroke and the medley relay, in
which he swam breaststroke. With
very busy parents in professional
jobs, LaNoue got little support at
meets from his parents. But with
such early strength, both he and his
parents realized all he needed was
the right training.

just before entering Lower Dau-
phin High School in Harrisburg
LaNoue and his parents agreed

“at the Lancaster Aquatic Club

was the training he needed. He
won district competitions in his
freshman year, but was very dissat-
isfied with what a little team there
was at his high school. In his
.ophomore year, he transferred to
Hershey, but still worked out on
the Lancaster Aquatic Club.

He continued to excel in the
sprint freestyle events at Hershey.
During his junior year in high
school, LaNoue took second in the
50-yard freestyle at the State cham-
pionships by only .02 of one
second. He also took third in the
100-yard freestyle.

It was his senior year that was his
glory. He not only won the 50- and

' -yard competitions but set two

e'w Pennsylvania state records in
the process. This made him one of
the most sought-after high school
swimming prospects in Pennsylva-
nia. Penn State, Tennessee, North
Carolina and a host of other top
teams tried recruiting him, but it
was Lewis and Pitt that won in the
end.

“I knew I had my pick," said
LaNoue, “so I did a lot of critical
looking. Sure, I knew swimming
would take tip a lot of my time and
so I put a lot of weight on the
coach, -pool and training facilities.
But I looked hard at the engineer-
ing programs at all the schools
because not‘ only do I want to go

Ed LaNoue

into engineering, but that's the best
judge of a school ’s overall standing
with me.” -

LaNoue enthusiastically dug
into Lewis's tough workouts early,
but not without experiencing their
pain.

“I was ‘Mint-Clo-Ed‘ all during
the Christmas holidays," said
LaNoue, who, like many others on
Pitt's team used Mint-Clo heat rub
before, during and after every prac-
tice. where as much as 700 laps or
more were swam daily.

"With the maximum Christmas
yardage and all the weight training
I did, the taper of distance this sea-
son should put me right down
around the national qualifying
times l'rn shooting for," LaNoue
said.

LaNoue and his fellow freestylt
ers will be heavily depended upon
at Easterns (to be held at Pitt this
year) for the top I6 places get
points, and Pitt’s lack of depth in
diving and long distance freestyle
will definitely httrt the defending
Eastern Champion Panthers. But
tht home pool advantage for
LaNoue is morv than it simply
sounds. I’

“The 50 (yard) freestyle is a total
head game. Everyone is going to
touch within three-quarters of a
sec()nd (after) the first-place fin-
isher. You need as many factors
going your way as you can if you’re
tliinking of winning. We've got
one of the fastest pools in the
nation, so my teammates and I are
all Iookirig forward to Easterns,"
LaNoue said.

Pitt has a chance of having four
or probably even five swimmers on
the starting blocks for the fastest
final championship heat. The stiff
competition.coupled with the Pitt
crowd, could very well produce
new l~‘.astern records in the two last-
est events in college swimming. the
50- and I00—yard Ireestyles.

For I.aNoue, the pressure of
being a standout varsity athlete
while trying to compete with mid-
terms that fall right around l€asl-
erns. is a battle he’ll have every year
at Pitt. Both bring a kind of pain
I.aI\'oue (IisIiI<es——one physical
and one mental.

But l.a.\'oue knows, most of all.
that ill he is ever going to succeed at
either swimming or engineering,
the road will I)e long and hard but
the reward well worth it. l.aNoue
has obviously accepted the
challenge.

Pitt Whips Mass —
Morgantown Awaits

“We’re still a young team, but
we’re competitive. I thought we
stayed with Pitt, one of the best
teams in the league. We’re one
player or two away from being a
good team," McLaughlin said.

While Mass’s performance can
be attributed to youth, and a little
lack of quality, Pitt’s non-inspired
play is due to only one thing-
Morgantown.

“We’re thinking about a show-
down on Wednesday,” said Clyde
Vaughan, high scorer for the game
with 19 points.

A showdown that has Roy Chip-

man anxiously awaiting.
“I‘ve been saying all along that

this game will go a long way in .

showing what kind of team we’ll
have for the tournament. The score
is important, but I’m more inter-
ested in how the team handles it."

Handling West Virginia figures
to be a little tougher than handling
Massachussetts.

Pitt Notes: The attendance for
the game was 2,360... Darrell Gis-

. sendanner had 18 points coming

off the bench... Andre Williams’
knees are apparently better as the
freshman started and contributed
10 points... Edwin Green led the
Minutemen with 16 points.

are working toward their goal of
winning liasterns, but Larson has a
few goals of his own.

“My goals in volleyball are the
same as rrry goals in life,” said Lar-
son. “I want more team members to
show an interest in God and begin
to think about God in a different
way."

According to 1.arson it was
through friends involved in volley-
ball that he became a Christian and
follower of God.

Coach Reilly believes his team
has improved its physical game,
but its mental game is still weak, a
key aspect in the, sport of
volleyball.

Larson agrees’. “Our team needs
to develop our spirits and souls
alotrg with our minds and bodies."

The Pitt spikers are I-0 in league

play and will be preparing for their
next league match against East
‘troudsburg on Feb. 27.
The Panthers finished third in
the East last year, behind Penn
State an(I Rutgers-Newark. Their
goal this year is to win liasterns,
and so far they’re on that winning
track. .

I .arson believes they can do thei
best to reach that goal if they work
their hardest along the way.

“If we play as hard as we can.
we've won, no matter what the
score is," said Larson.
