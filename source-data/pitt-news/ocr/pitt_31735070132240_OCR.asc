El N iﬁo burns its
competition at bowl

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

“Einstein and ‘Ren and Stimpy,”’ said
Nate Jones, a junior at Pitt and Tau Epsilon
Phi brother, while participating in the
annual College Bowl Tournament.

Jones only got half of the answer
right, since the book that Einstein Wrote
was about Brownian Motion, not the pop-
ular dog and cat duo portrayed on televi-
sion.

The Pitt Program Council organized
the tournament Each member of the win-
ning team received a $25 gift certiﬁcate to
a local bookstore. Select members from all
the teams were chosen to form an all-star

* team to participate in the regional tourna-

ment at Pennsylvania State University.
The tournament was similar to those
held by Quiz Bowl, the Scholastic Bowl
and the “It’s Academic” television show,
in which teams compete with each other
by answering questions to score points.
The tournament started on Sunday at
11 am. on the sixth ﬂoor of; the William
Pitt Union, with ﬁve teams scheduled to
play in the double elimination tournament.
Mercedes Brown, PPC’s necreation
director, commented on the lack of specta-

‘The people who would watch are the
people who are playing,” Brown said. “It’s
more interesting to participate in than it is
to watc  ’
After the designated start time a roll
was called, and the four teams that were

' present were told to choose names for

themselves.

One team called themselves TEPs are
Tops, representing and comprised of Tau
Epsilon Phi members.

“We haven’t done this before,” Jdnes
said. “It’s more or less to maintain o11r aca-
demic reputation and to get our name out
there in something we can be proud 0 .”

_ TEPS are Tops were beaten in ‘the ﬁrst
round of the tournament by 'team Vrpace,
who named themselves after something

written on the chalkboard from a previous
activity. TEP was forced into the sec-
ondary bracket, as part of the double elim-
ination rules.

“We’ve done this for three years,” said
David Salcida, a senior at Pitt. “We are
kind of here to defend our third place
title.”

. When asked what his strengths in the
tournament might be, Salcida thought his
best talents lay elsewhere.

’ “I would like to think that my
strengths are with the women,” he said.

. Vrpace was beaten in the second
round by team Burned by El Niﬁo in a spe-
cial tiebreaker round, since both teams
were at 140 points.

Finding themselves undefeated before
the last match of the tournament wasn’t
completely expected by the Bumed—Vmerr1-
bers, according to Pitt senior Sam

- Scheinman.

Burned by El Nifro also defeated team

' Dire Weasels in order to remain undefeat-
_ed throughout the tournament.

The  Weasels had two members,
both from Quiz Bowl." Erik. Roth spoke
about the ease of joining the organization
if a student wanted to.

“This is one of the oddities of Quiz
Bowl,” Roth said. “It’s a_very short step
from not being in Quiz_ Bowl to being in
Quiz Bowl.”

Vrpace fought their way back to Win
the “losers” bracket of the tournament,
which qualiﬁedthem to play Burned by El
Niﬁo for the championship, and the chance
‘at the $25 gift certiﬁcates. '

Luck was not on their side as they
were defeated by Burned by El Niﬁo, with
the ﬁnal score being 200 to 230, but
Vrpace took losing well.

“We ‘had fun, we played -well” said-

Vipace member Tom Carboy, a senior at
Pitt.

The mood was very bright with team
Burned by El Niﬁo, as Melanie Stebbins, a
junior at Pitt, was glad she woke up in tim
for the event. .

SNOW CREATES A MESS FOR STUDENTS

Robert of Arbrissel, a Catholic priest
who lived in the 11th century, surrounded
himself with women “to mortify the’ ﬂesh”
—— a temptation that would require great
discipline to overcome, according to letters
from those who opposed him.

Pitt Professor Bruce Venarde, a faculty
member in the history department, gave a

was, and remains, a controversial ﬁgure
because of his unorthodox spiritual prac-
tices involving sexuality in evangelism. In
Room 2628 of the Cathedral of Learning,
attendees snacked on cookies and coﬂ’ee
while listening to Venarde, whose lecture
was titled “Sexuality and Spirituality in
Medieval Christianity: Methodological
Considerations.” .
Venarde’s lecture was the ﬁrst of the
religious studies departrnent’s Brown Bag
Lunch‘ Colloquium Series. The midday

meetings of roughly one hour are part of a

lecture last Friday concerning Robert, who ’

Priest discussedover lunch C

series of lectures on Various subjects within

_ the realm of religious studies.

During the ﬁrst half of thelecture,

Vena_rde handed out maps to aid his discus- ‘

sion as he described the life of Robert of
Arbrissel. Venarde’s book, ‘ “Robert _of
Arbrissel: A Medieval Religious Life,”

depicts the life of the controversial ﬁgure A

he described in his lecture. The meeting
wound down with questions about the book
and Venarde’s further studies on the sub-
ject. '

Venarde’s ﬁelds of expertise include
medieval European history, western civi-
lization, pre-modern slavery, race, ethnicity
and gender.

The Brown Bag Lunch Colloquium
series will continue throughout this semes-
ter, with its next lecture on Feb. 13.
Snjezana Buzov, ﬁom the history depart-
ment, will give a lecture titled “Archives as

THE PITT. NEWS

Classroom shortage helps
cause scheduling changes

KEVIN FUNK
Staff Writer

While Pitt’s. « tuition and
Chancellor Nordenberg’s salary
appear to be locked in a perpetual
increase, there is one thing at Pitt

that seems to be on‘ the decline:

classroom space. - » . .

With the stated purpose of
improving room usage, Pitt recently
revised a policy originally adopted
in July 1990 to ensure that depart-
ments only schedule twice—a—week,
75-minute classes on Tuesdaysand
Thursdays, or during non-peak
times on other days. . . ‘

According »to this Jan. 1, 2003

revision, “All classes of 75-minute.

duration will meet on a Tuesday-
Thursday schedule,” with an excep-
tion forclasses that take place from
8 a.m. to 9:15 a.m., 3 p.m. to 4:15
p.m., or 4:30 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. on a
Monday-Wednesday, Monday-

Friday, or Wednesday-Friday

schedule. V
“It was a problem that everyone
wants classes between 9 [a.m.] and

-2, [p.m.],” Associate University

Registrar Barbara Heron said,

adding that allowing 75-minute»

classes during peak times on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
would greatly. complicate the
scheduling of 50-minute’ courses,
and thus ~ mean that there -simply
would not be adequate space,avail-
able. “There are enough rooms if
eVerything’s properly utilized,” she
said.

Some departments, however,
report that "scheduling classes has
been a rather difficult process.

~ Fiore Pugliano, an English
department adviser’ and lecturer,
described the current situation "as a
“severe room crunch.” Though he
said he sees the scheduling policy
as a necessity, he also views it as
being somewhat problematic.
According to Pugliano, the policy
ensures that more courses are
scheduled on Fridays by essentially
limiting the Monday-Wednesday
option — an outcome that has
caused some resentment among stu-
dents and faculty.

“Many people don’t like to
teach on Fridays,” he said, noting
that student advisees are also often
frustrated by having to take Friday
classes. 1

An additional factor in the room
availability problem, said Pugliano,
has been high enrollment. From fall

"of 1996 until fall of 2002, Pitt’s

overall enrollment increased 8.3
percent, as reported in the Jan. 9,
2003 edition of The Pitt News.
According to Pugliano, with
this increasingly high enrollment,
many popular classes are scheduled
at the worst times — meaning
Fridays, early "mornings and late
afternoons — because they fill, up

regardless. “Students get trapped,”

he said. ,

Nevertheless, Pugliano noted
that some departments have an eas-
ier time with their scheduling
process. Film studies, for example,
which is housed in’the English
department, has special require-
ments forthe technology that must
be available in a room and the
length of class time required to

screen movies, meaning that it can

sidestep many of the . scheduling
issues that affect other departments.

Also, he said, departments try to
use their conference rooms as class-

-rooms to mitigate the room avail-

ability problems.

With the construction taking
place in the Cathedral of Learning
and the resulting loss of classroom
space in the eastern part of the sec-

ond and third ﬂoors, some courses

are scheduled for rooms that are

.,.,considered to be too far away by

many students and faculty.
Classes, said’ psychology major
Chris Linnenbach, often seem as

though they are randomly sched-

uled “all over the campus.”
Linnenbach, who is a sophomore,
noted that he has a.political science
course in Victoria Hall, ‘a class for
which‘ he would often be late

’ because he must to walk there
immediately after a class in the

Cathedral.

In response to this criticism,
Heron stressed that the registrar’s
office does what it can.

“When classes are cancelled, we
try to move people out of faraway
buildings,” she said.

With construction in the
Cathedral scheduled to continue
until December 2004, and increas-
ing enrollment figures, the situation
is’ not expected to improve in the

near future.

Despite these difficulties,
Heron emphasized that there is
enough classroom space if depart-
ments schedule their classes equi-
tably and that they “try very hard”
to schedule classes in a way that

accommodates everyone’s wishes.

“But sometimes, we just can’t
do it,” she said.

EDITORIAL

Oversteppingboundaries in"France

In light of religious-based vio-
lence in France, officials there are
pushing for a ban on wearing reli-
gious symbols in public schools.

This would include Christian
crosses, Jewish skullcaps and Sikh
head coverings. A

In a parliamentary debate
Tuesday, Education Minister Luc
Ferry said that the planned ban could
even extend to beards, sometimes
worn as an alternative method of
Muslim identification.

Separation of church and state is
an idea that Americans hold dear.
Attempts to curb violence are a good
thing. Yet, in this case, the French
are going too far with both.

Where does protection end and
intrusion begin? It’s a noble goal of
any government to protect its citi-
zens. It is not any government’s
place, however, to regulate the reli-
gious choices and expressions of its
citizens.

The proposed ban is attacking
the problem of religious violence
from the wrong end. It is unfair to
regulate the behavior of potential
victims of ethnic attacks. The right
way to approach the problem is to
crack down on those who would per-
petrate such attacks. To enact a ban
on religious expression for fear that
it willlprovoke hate crimes is like
telling women that short skirts are

illegal because they can provoke
rape. It’s simply wrongheaded.

A more sinister interpretation of
the proposed ban would be to see
anti-Muslim sentiment beneath it.
France has a sizeable Muslim popu-
lation, and it‘ exists in a climate of
fear and distrust. So, it is within the
realm of possibility that this ban is
meant to take from Muslims a com-

_ mon bond, a means of identification

and rallying, and that banning
Christian and Jewish symbols is
merely paying lip service to fairness.

Banning beards, specifically, is
completely absurd. To say that a
Muslim wearing a beard istrying to
sneak around a ban on other reli-
gious expression is a tenuous con-
nection at best. It’s a draconian mea-
sure, completely uncalled for.
Besides, beards are not exclusively
religious symbols. Will lazy teens
unaccustomed to the need for daily
shaving be persecuted as religious
extremists? Will Christian boys be
allowed to wear beards, but not their
Muslim classmates? When does
careless grooming become religious
expression?

A It’s unfair to leave this distinc-
tion to public school teachers, who
have enough to do without searching
for contraband symbols. If religious-
ly motivated crimes are a problem,
punish the criminals, not the victims.

Abortiondebate is not just about women

“These are our rights, folks.
Fetuses don’t have rights; we have
rights, and we need to stand up and
demand them,” Laura Horowitz, a
speaker at last week’s Roe V. Wade
panel, said,-. “Abortion in this coun-
try is not about children. It’s about
women and who controls them.”

Every January, around the

' anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a new

group of panelists arrives
at Pitt to make bold,
empowering, unsubstanti-
ated statements about the
rights a fetus doesn’t have.

There are valid points
to be considered about

embryo becomes a human,
points that offer support
and criticism to both sides
of the debate.

But this topic is always

‘ignored by panelists like

Horowitz, not because they don’t
know about it, but because they
don’t. care. They are far too
ingrained in a stance that gets
weaker as the debate evolves — the
idea that abortion is about “women
and who controls them.”

Mark Goldblatt is a journalist
and legal analyst who studies the‘
abortion debate- while remaining
impressively objective. In the
June/July 2002 issue of Philosophy
Now, he critiques the idea that
women" must have unchecked con-
trol over their bodies: “As a defense
of abortion rights, the argument is
either, demonstrably false or logi-
cally meaningless. Even if we grant
the contentious point that the fetus
is part of the woman’s body, it’s
simply untrue that American citi-
zens, male or female, exercise
absolute sovereignty over their own

 

Eric Miller
Columnist

bodies.” _

Goldblatt supports this point by
citing laws against prostitution and
the sale of internal organs. If people
had complete, sovereignty over their
own bodies, they would be allowed
to sell sex or a kidney and make a
quick buck.

But, if legal, these processes
lead directly to exploitation of the
poor, and so the gov-
ernment can and must
govern people’s bodies
in certain cases.

If we see a develop-
ing fetus as a develop-
ing human in danger of
being killed, govern-
ment intervention is
justified and neces-
sary.

It‘ is important, if

this discussion is to go,

Trying to scale walls of ignorance andapathy

I was staring at the largest wall
I had ever seen in my life. It
reached far over my head and
extended around to cover my entire
visual range. I had seen walls like
this before and they made me feel
tired inside. .

Perhaps it had been the many
times I had climbed them in the past
or maybe it was my confusion as to
why they had never been torn down,
but for whatever reason, I was find-

ing it hard to do ‘much besides look
at the wall. I knew what I had to do, I

but it was taking me a while to well
up the energy to do it. <

George Lane arrived at his hear,-
ing at a courthouse in" Tennessee.
Lane’s hearing was on the second
floor of the building, inaccessible
to him in his wheelchair. The court-
room had no ramps or elevators, so
Lane, refusing to be carried,
crawled up the stairs. Court
employees laughed at him.

As for me, seeing the taller peo-
ple didn’t help. All around me, men,
women, even small children where
crossingcver the wall without so
much, as a second thought. Some
merely stepped over it, others
scaled ‘it with a single, effortless
jump. I hadn’t moved.

\ Beverly Jones works as a court
reporter. Some of the courthouses

‘she works at are not accessible to

her wheelchair. One day, Jones
accepted the offer of: a court
employee to carry her up the stairs
to the courtroom. While carrying

Jones, the employee slipped.- Jones
nearly fell down the
entire ﬂight of stairs. Her
fall was broken when she
crashed into someone
else. or

The wall felt familiar
and painful when I first
placed my hand on it.
Finding what appeared to
be a suitable hold, I
began to pull myself up.
Inch by inch, I dragged
myself upwards, muscles
aching, fingers bleeding,
nails cracking. Sweat
was burning my partially closed
eyes, but they were open enough to

see that I hadn’t gotten far off the’

ground.

I could hear,the people around
me as I climbed; Some were laugh-
ing and pointing, others talked of
ways to remedy my predicament.
One proposed simply throwing me
over the wall.,Some questioned why
I evenbothered to try climbing it in
the first place, why I didn’t just stay
on the other side. Others asked me
if I wanted help, a push or a pull,
unaware of how ignorant they
sounded. I did not want help living
my life. I was different then most
people and often times alone.

Ralph Ramsey is the defendant
in a civil lawsuit. Arriving at the
courthouse, he discovered that his
wheelchair prevented him from
entering the courtroom. He sent
word to the judge that the second

 

David’ J. McCarthy

Columnist

floor was not accessible to him.
- After some time, a prose-
cuting attorney walked
down stairs to inform
Ramsey that he lost the
case and owed his client
$1,500. The trial had
gone on without him.
By the time I reached
the top of the wall, I
could see the small, con-
cerned group assembled
on the other side‘. They
were familiar to me by
' now. What still hurt was
to see the millions who
kept walking along, unaware of my
tiny existence, apathetic to me and
to most matters of the world. They
were the ones who built the wall.

I amjnot confined to ‘a wheel-
chair. But if I was, I imagine that
the whole -world must look to be full
of walls.

The walls will not come down
easily, but some need to be torn
down before others.

Lane, Jones and Ramsey are
suing the respective states where
the courthouses reside in an attempt
to force the federal government to
make all courthouses wheelchair
accessible. They see the current sit-
uation as an injustice. The states do
not. ‘

According to information in
recent New York Times articles, the
states do not think that any of these
people’srights have been violated.
They even go so far as to say that a

person does not have the right to
attend their own trial.

In 1990, the Americans with
Disabilities Act was created to pro-

tect the rights of disabled citizens. _

However, over the years, the act has
been under attack in courtrooms,
and some of its original power has
been stripped away. Many people,
and states, feel that it is simply not
necessary to build a ramp here or an
elevator there. It was probably eas-
ier for these people to plead their
cases, not having to crawl or be car-
ried to be heard.

I understand that it will be a

while before every apartment,
office, and even school building is
wheelchair accessible. But the lack
of ramps and elevators in court-
houses is a complete disgrace.
Apparently, the phrase “justice for
all” has been replaced with “justice
for all who can walk.”

It is hard for some people to
envision what life is like for those
who are different. Caring takes
valuable time and money. Apathy is
easy and cheap.

But the next time you walk any-
where, picture every doorway, step
and staircase as a wall. Then ask
yourself what you would do for a
ladder

Miller,‘ page 4 s 
human life. i

For all the PR problems that the pro-choice
side supposedly has, they have a remarkableway
of presenting themselves as ‘compassionate, and
I don’t doubt that many of them are.

But their arguments are skewed, always mak-
ing reference to the exceptions — women facing
death in childbirth, victims of rape or incest,
confused teenagers with their whole lives ahead
of them. They rarely focus on the bulk of abor-
tion cases. _

. These are represented by women who use
abortion as birth control, whose lives are in no

’ danger, who have not been raped, who have

made conscious decisions and want the easiest
way out.

I can’t think.of a more slanted fight than
Convenience vs. Accountability. I am willing to
discuss the special cases separately and give
them some more direct attention, but it is gross-
ly inaccurate to constantly cite them as the rule.

If, in the coming years, medical science
should change the popular way we define a
human, focusing on heartbeat or brain activity
instead of birth, will the debate end? Probably
not, because this issue isn’t‘ab‘out children, it’s
about women. In his book, ‘.‘Rethinking Life and
Death,” amid scores of other complex and varied
ideas on the subject,
philosopher/professor/author Peter Singer sums
up my biggest frustration in one sentence:
“Advocates of legal abortion cannot remain neu-

tral about when the developing human being.

acquires a right to life.”

Skewedarguments rely on exceptions, not the norm

And yet they do.

Every January we read about pro-choice dis-
cussions where women stand up and say “This
issue is all about us.”

Two years ago, Students for Reproductive
Freedom went so far as to throw a party com-
plete with cheerleaders who shouted slogans and
tossed condoms into the audience.

But for all the fiery speeches and fanfare
they will never explain why a newborn baby is

so different from a third-trimester, unborn baby;

why one is just an impersonal fetus and the other
is an adorable child.

_ They have no answer for this question, and
that’s why I believe someday we will look back
on these events and lose our appetites.

The Bens are three guys with the same
name who are about to rock your world

The Bens EP

A lot of people are named Ben.
According to the Social Security
Administration Web site, Ben was the
28th most popular baby name in 2002.
Three Bens came together in 2003
to form a supergroup to challenge all
supergroups in the history of music.
They call themselves The Bens,
appropriate enough for three talented
musicians. And combined, they have
released more albums than most
bands do in their entire careers.
Included in the group is Ben Lee,
a young Aussie, who has worked with
several different Australian bands,
including being the front man T for
Noise Addict in the early and mid
‘90s. Lee is also known for his solo

work, including his latest release enti--

tled Hey You, Yes You.
The other young buck of the

group is Ben Kweller, a Texas native.

who has worked his way through the
music world with both charm and tal-
ent. Known for his incredible voice
and an acoustic sound, Kweller has
caught the attention of many people
with the release of his ATO Records
debut album Sha Sha. A

But the age and wisdom of the

I group comes from Ben Folds. The

former front man of Ben Folds Five
— now well into a successful solo
career — Folds brings maturity along
with a1l—around talent to this incredi-
ble combination of musicians.

Folds was originally supposed to

release a third EP after his previous
two were released last summer and
fall, but instead teamed up with the
other Bens when they toured Australia
together. Before setting off to tour the
land down under, they spent four days
in Ben Folds’ home studio to record a
four—song EP to sell while touring.

The Bens EP is a very catchy four-
song release. Because it has eclectic
differences in style on each track, the
listener never loses interest.

The first song, “Just Pretend,” is a
group effort in every form. Each Ben
contributes — joining in the chorus
with a beautiful harmony —-— making a
sweet, acoustic love song.

Following “Just Pretend” is the
Ben Lee—inspired track, “Xfire,” filled
with synthesizers and electric key-
boards. The dance song of the album,
it has a catchy beat that sticks in your
head and keeps your big toe ‘tapping.
A nice touch to this track is that they
use a computer voice togoccasionally
sing a line of the chorus, adding to the
electronic feel. ,

“Stop!” is the Kweller—inspired
track, a somber track with piano and
drums driving the musical composi-
tion.‘ Though it is slow at .times, it has

a faster pulse toward the climactic‘

end.

Ben Folds’ ‘lost love’ song,

_, “Bruised,” rounds out the four—track

disc. The same style that every Ben
Folds’ fan has loved since the debut

self—titled Ben Folds Five album is ’

displayed on this track. He sings with
emotion a. song about being hurt by
love and having the marks_to prove it.
“The world won’t turn until some-

thing breaks/ who will make the first,
last mistake? They say that good
things come to those who wait. / Into
the spiral/ your world and my world/
it’s never final/ Love just leaves you
bruised.”

Four tracks, taking less than 15
minutes, capture what this dynamic
group of musicians achieved in their
respective solo careers. With youth
and maturity, The Bens capture pure
music at its very best. Hopefully, if
planning to team-up again — maybe

for a full—length album —- they would
likely rock the socks off the music
industry.

Big Creak is about to
make a splash in rock

The Big Creak just started a new
genre. They have their own soul and
style that is hard to describe in a few

' words. But in a sentence, they have the

almost cocky lyrical attitude of Maroon
5 and Matchbox 20. The lead singer,

p Jim Koch, has a voice_that sounds like a

mixture between Scott Blasey from The
Clarks and Jason Mraz. Whatever they
want to be called is up to the audience,
but I would like to call them good.

. Listening to their third independent,
ful1—length release, their musical and
lyrical talent catches the ears of fans and
critics alike. They have jazz inﬂuences
with a ﬂare of acoustic rock. Songs like
“Wendy” break down into musical jam
sessions in the styles of Dave Matthews
or G Love and Special Sauce.

Singer—songwriter Jim Koch
formed the band with keyboardist
Aaron Bright while attending Bowling
Green State University in 1996. After
graduating, they moved to Columbus
Ohio, where they soon found drummer
-Maxwell Button and bassist Paul

The way to win a girl’s heart

I would like to personally thank
the gentleman who approached me
last spring with a rose in his hand.
His gesture of kindness and selfless-
ness gave me hope in the male sex.

That was right before he charged
me $3. Thank you, Rose Man.

I guess I got to thinking about
Rose Man several days ago when I
saw my man cheat on me by pulling
the same stunt on a blonde walking
by him. Poor thing. I
think the even raised
the price.

heart.

Pittforward LaToya Kincaid puts up a shot over an’opponent during a game

earlier this season. Kincaid led the Panthers with 25 points and'10 rebounds.

Pitt drops road
game to St. J ohn’s

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

In most instances, when a team
scores more than 70 points, shoots
80 percent from the free-throw line,
and holds its opponent to a field
goal percentage of less than 50 per-

cent, a victoryresults.

Unfortunately for the Pitt
women’s basketball team, these
achievements were not enough as
the Panthers lost to St. J ohn’s 83-72
in Jamaica, New York last Saturday.

“Our, effort was , excellent,”
assistant coach Marynell Meadors
said.,“[But] we can play better. Our
defense was up and down and that’s
why we lost the game.”

During the game, Pitt (6-11, 2-5

‘ Big East) forced the Red Storm into

committing ~24 turnovers on 48 per-
cent field goal shooting. However,

poor shooting and 26 turnovers of
their own cost the Panthers a win.

“We put St. John’s in a- position
to score easy points,” Meadors said.
“We cut out those mistakes and we
get a win.”

Early in the game, Pitt was able
to take a nine-point lead on a free-
throw by senior forward Latoya
Kincaid. However, St. John’s (8-9,
2-4 Big East) fought back and used
a 19-7 run to take a 39-34 halftime
advantage. The Red Storm lead
grew to 21 points in the secondhalf
before a late Pitt rally cut the score
to 81-71. With the loss, the
Panthers dropped their third con-
secutive conference game.

Despite the loss, Pitt received a
strong performance‘ from Kincaid,
who registered a double-double

Resourceful Panthers win by sharing responsibilities

There is no super-

80 what? ,
This is the dumb-‘
est excuse for why the
Panthers can’t be that

 

team.’ But apparently,
most people around
college basketball
believe that Pitt isn’ t very good.

 

Let’s see —' Pitt was disrespected in the pre- _

season polls by being ranked 22nd while the
Syracuse Orangemen were ranked a lofty No. 7

‘ and UConn seems to always find its way back up

to the No. 1 spot.

Pitt spanked Syracuse on in its -own house,
and had the Panthers eliminated some of their
mistakes against the Huskies, they would be 20-
0. i ‘

The Panthers actually moved up a spot to No.

7 in the AP Poll this week. They are finally get-‘

ting respect, more than two months into the sea-
son. Doesn’t that bother anybody? I
Obviously, Syracuse was overrated and
UConn is questionable after losing ' to
Providence, yet another unranked team. Nobody

T is saying much abput why’ Pitt played UConn so

closely, but an excuse that I have heard from a

friend who is a Syracuse fan is that.guard Gerry
McNamara was-not playing at 100 percent.

It doesn’t.matter. Sure, it would have helped
Syracuse if it had its starting point guard healthy,
but he’s not hitting .30 points on the Panthers’
defense, which amounts to 22 points more that he
would have needed to tack on to his game total in
order to have beaten the Panthers.

Pitt lost point guard Carl Krauser for four

1 games and still remained undefeated. Fine — the

Panthers did not play any teams that were very
good. I know that’s the argument that some col-
lege basketball fans will make.

But if Syracuse is supposed to have been so
much better than Pitt then it should have been
able to get by or at least give the‘ Panthers a chal-
lenge withor without McNamara. That’s just the
point. Pitt does not depend on one player to win
games. The Orangemen lost back-to-back games
since McNamara was injured.

With the Panthers, it is somebody different
every game that steps up and delivers albig game
to help them win. One game it’s Krauser, then it’s
guard J aron Brown and even forward Mark
McCarroll got in on the act against Syracuse
along with forward Chevon Troutman.

Krauser, Brown and Julius Page were held

under 10 points in the game. That probably

would indicate that the Panthers would not fare

too well against the Orangemen, but that’s the
great thing about Pitt — it shares the ball and
responsibility. McCarroll dropped, 15 points and
was tied for the Panthers’ leading scoreralong

with center Chris Taft. Taft also contributed 15 he
points, and Troutman scored 12 and grabbed ll "

boards.’

This is the same argument that I made a few
weeks back about why the Philadelphia Eagles
weren’t that good of a team. Philadelphia was a
one-man show and I rest my case after what hap-
pened in the NFC Championship game. A team
like the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots
don’t have a team full of superstars, but they
come together as a unit and win despite injuries.

I guess that’s how the Patriots and Panthers
are similar. They don’t have a lot of ﬂare on
offense, but play great defense. The Panthers are
able to play'to their strength, which is that they
are a physical team. Syracuse was not able to
keep up with Pitt’s physicality; therefore, it was
dominated in the paint.

Even though nobody else looks at Pitt as hav— I

ing superstars in their line up, I’m sure Pitt fans
see things differently. The Panthers in fact do

No. 17 Men’s swimming and diving squeaks past

SHAUNNA STUCK
Staff Writer

A close finish of a mere 0.77
seconds was all the No. 17 Pitt
men’s swimming and diving team
needed for its victory Saturday over
host Penn State.

Down by two points going into
the final event of the dual meet, the
200-yard freestyle relay team of
Darryl Washington, Stephen Kilroy,

Adam Webber and Tommy Bird
touched the wall first with a time of
1:23.63 seconds. ,
The Pitt men’s team (9-1)
defeated Penn State 125-118 while
the women fell to 6-4 overall, drop-
ping decisions to both the No. 13
Nittany Lions and No. 12 Indiana,
The 200-yard medley team of
Chad White, Dave Montgomery,
Ryan Jackson and «Andrew
Patrizzi opened the men’s meet with

a victory in 1:32.47 seconds. This

was followed by a 1-3-5 finish in
the 1000 yard freestyle, with senior
Eric Limkemann placing first, near-
ly six seconds faster than his oppo-
nent.

Penn State registered its first
victories in the 200- and 50-yard
freestyle bouts, but the Panthers’
Jason Miller extended the lead to 11
points with his victory in the 200
yard individual medley.

Pitt then pulled its second 1-3-5
finish in the 200-yard backstroke
with freshman Jeff Leath touching
the wall first with a time of 1:50.24
seconds.

After two more Penn State vic-
tories in the 500-yard, freestyle and
3—meter diving competition, Pitt
trailed 108-99. However, the
Panthers came through when senior
Randy Gertenbach and sophomore
Steve Marcucio finished in first and
second place respectively in the
100-yard breaststroke

This was followed by the 200-

yard freestyle relay victory, which

sealed the win for Pitt.
With no individual winners or first
place finishes, the "women did not
fare as well in their 20—event com-
petition against the two Big Ten
opponents.

Pitt women’s swimming and

-diving team lost 293-76 to host

Penn State and fell to the Hoosiers,
271.5-95.5 over the course of
Friday and Saturday.

Penn State then went on to
defeat Indiana, 188-180. ‘

The 200-yard freestyle relay
team of Carolyne Savini, Jenny
Livingstone, Kelly Redcay and
Kristin Brown had a third place fin-
ish with a time of 1:35.48 seconds.

Junior Cynthia Snyder finished
in third in the 100-yard breast-
stroke, with senior teammate Ryan
Redman just five hundredths of a
second behind her, in a tie for
fourth place.

In "the 3—meter diving event,‘
sophomore Colleen Kristobak fin-
ished in fourth place of eight com-
petitors. Senior Kelli Tielking also

finished in fourth place in the 100-

yard butterfly.

The Panthers will face Virginia"

Tech and nationally—ranked Virginia
next weekend.

with 25 points and 10 rebounds.

“She [Kincaid] is having a good
year,” Meadors said. “We’ve been
riding her and we all have to step
up and give a little bit more [to take
the pressure off Kincaid].”

Also playing well for the
Panthers were freshman forward
Jennifer Brown and sophomore
guard Jessica.Al1en. Brown came
off the bench to contribute 13
points and seven boards while Allen
drilled three three—pointers to finish
with 12 points. .

“Jess [Allen] was more aggres-
sive at the beginning [of the game]
than she’s been in a long time,”
Meadors said. “Jen gives us a spark
off the bench.”

For St. John’s, Kim MacMillan,
Shemika Stevens, and Reka
Szavuly contributed 16 points each
in the winning effort.

While Pitt suffered a disap-

pointing loss, Meadors is pleased
with the progress the team has made
since the beginning of the season.
“Our players are getting so
much better,” Meadors said.

“Everyone’s playing hard. It’s a
totally different team [than the team
from last fall].”

Evidence of the Panthers’
improvement could be seen in two
areas following the St. John’s con-
test. Pitt’s free-throw percentage
was an impressive 80 percent for
the game, including 11 of 12 in the
second half, while the Panthers out-
rebounded the Red Storm 40-34.

“We shot the ball extremely
well from the free-thro.w 1ine,”
Meadors said.

Pitt’s next game will be against
West Virginia (13-5, 4-2 Big East)
on Saturday, Jan. 31 at 2 p.m. at the
Petersen Events Center. The game
is a rematch of a close game from
earlier in the season that saw the
Mountaineers win 65-58. Meadors
knows that in order for the Panthers

’to be victorious they will need to
defend well and get off to a strong

start. — .

“We’ve got to do a great job
defending Kate Bulger and we’ve
got to get off to a goodstart,”
Meadors said. “We gave the St.»
John’s game away so now we have
to go out and get another.”
