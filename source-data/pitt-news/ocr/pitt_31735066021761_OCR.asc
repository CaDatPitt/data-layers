.ANo problems yet
with police change

By Jill Carell

Assistant News Editor

Since the Jan; 12 reorganiza-
tion of Pittsburgh Police stations,
some Oakland businesses are

3 concerned about an increase in

FA

crime.

Pittsburgh Police Station No. 4,
at the corner of Louisa and Sem-
ple streets in south Oakland, has

- become a Special Operations Di-
vision, comprised of policemen,
firemen and paramedics designat-
ed for disaster situations. ‘

Police officers who previously
reported to No.‘4 now report to
No. 6 in Squirrel Hill and patrol

_Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shady-
side, Regent Square, Swisshelm
Park and Hazelwood.

Many Forbes Avenue business
operators in Oakland said they
haven't noticed any change in
police protection or crime since
thechange, but it may be too ear-
ly to tell, they said. -

One employee who preferre
to remain anonymous said he
does believe there is going to be
an increase in crime in Oakland.

”There’s not a noticeable
change right now. It's going to.be
a springtime specialty; there's go-
ing to be less control,” he said.

Joanne Polk, manager of Mis-

ter Donut on Forbes Avenue,
agreed. ’’I don't think we can

really tell yet. Once people real- .

ize the coverage i sn’t as effective
as it was, there is going to be
more people taking risks as far as

trouble for libraries

bustling headquarters in the base-' V

By Chris Zurawsky

For The Pitt News

At the East Liberty branch of the
Carnegie Library on Pittsburgh, a
67-year-old librarian was at-
tacked by a man armed with a
shard of mirror glass. The wom-
an sustained a gash above the left
eye before the assailant was sub-

""" dued by a library security guard

F.

(a- former prison guard), and
several male-patrons.

The assailant explained, ’’I
thought she had a migraine and
l was trying to cure it.”

”Thank God he didn't think
she had a sore throat,” said Tho-
mas C. Wilkinson, head of secu-
rity at Carnegie Library.

For the past eight and a half
years, Wilkinson, a retired lieu-
tenant colonel of the U.S. Army,
has administered and kept the
peace at the library's 23' branches
throughout Pittsburgh, including
the museum complex. From his

ment of the library's main branch
in Oakland, Wilkinson attempts
to stay -one step ahead of the
problems inherent in'a contem-
porary, urban environment.
According to Wilkinson,

crimes in libraries usually fall into

one of four categories: vandalism,
problem patrons, theft and
assault.‘ ‘

In the case of assaults, incidents
are few and far between, the
majority occuring in large
metropolitan areas such as New
"York City, Chicago and Los
Angeles. .

These attacks are usually ran-
dom and unprovoked, most often
committed by the mentally dis-
turbed.

Wilkinson related that one

New York City library was the.

object of a takeover attempt by a

street gang who wanted to turn it

into a clubhouse. Now the library

WASHINGTON — President

Reagan, silent for weeks on the
Iran arms sale scandal, answe_r_e_d

’’all questions" Monday from an ~

investigative‘ committee about
authorizing secret weapon ship-

mentsto Tehran, the White

House said.

Reagan met for 76 minutes
with the three-member commit-
tee he named Nov. 26 to probe
the actions of the National Secu-
rity Council staff following dis-
closure that‘ profits from secret
arms sales to Iran were diverted
to Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

It was the first time Reagan had

I discussed the Iran initiative with

any outside group.

' “in the course of the meeting, ‘

the president answered all of the

_panel’s questions,” a White

House statement said. "The
wide-ranging review included the
development of policy in relation
to Iran, the factual history of the
president's role in the Iran initia-
tive and the US. foreign policy‘
process in general.” _ J
The statement said the group,
known formally as the Special
Review Board, will meet again
with Reagan at his invitation.

It was not known whether the"

president cleared up confusion
resulting from contradictory state-
ments by current and former
White House aides about when
he first authorized arms ship-
ments to Iran.

Robert C. McFarlane, Reagan's
former national security adviser,
has told Congress that the presi-

dent had given prior approval for

arms toglran in August 1985.

However, White,House Chief
of Staff Donald T. Regan has said
Reagan, did not approve the ship-
ment in advance, and Attorney
General Edwin Meese Ill saidthe
president approved it only when
he-' learned of it after the fact.

At the Capitol, meanwhile,
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.l., chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, said there was
a link between the latest kidnap-
pings in Lebanon and Reagan's
arms sales with Iran.

”When the administration en-

gaged in exchanging weapons for-

hostages, it started down a very
slippery slope indeed, because it
showed if people took hostages,
they might get something benefi-
cial to them for doing that,” Pell
said. '

Reagan has denied that the
arms sent to Iran were part of a
swap for Americans held hostage
in Lebanon. Instead, he has ar-
gued that the ‘shipments were in-
tended to help reopen contacts
with a strategically important na-
tion and that release of hostages
was only a secondary goal.

Reagan has made no public
mention of the lran-Contra affair
since before Christmas and has
not answered any questions since
a Nov. 19 news conference.

Board spokesman Herbert A.
Hetu said the group's report, due 
"Feb. 19, probably would not con-

tain details of Reagan's com-'

ments but instead would report,"
findings, recommendations and ‘

conclusions.
Tower's panel, also composed

of former Sen. Edmund Muskie P

(D-Maine) and Brent Scowcroft,
the national security adviser in
the Ford administration, has inter-
view 47 people, including form-

Marcos supporters seize television station

MANILA, Philippines — About
300 soldiers of a military frater-
nity linked to recent coup rumors
took over a private television sta-
tion early Tuesday but were sur-
rounded by soldiers loyal to the
Marcos government. '- -

An announcer on‘ government
radio said the troops entered the
offices of Channel 7 around 3
a.m._(2 p.m. EST). He said the

soldierswere wearing red and

white arm bands and evidently
came from units normally sta-
tioned north of the capital.

A Filipino reporter said soldiers
from the Capital Regional Com-
mandhad been sent to the station
too and were deployed outside.

— Officers at the scene said the’

move against Channel 7 was car-
ried out by members of the Guar-

dians, a fraternity which claims

the membership of about 70 per-
cent of the officers and men of
the armed forces.

Release of prisoner
Nicaraguan peace gift

WASHINGTON —-— Ambas—_

sador Carlos Tunnermann has

been instructed by his govern-
ment to get in touch with Rep.
Tony Hall ( D—Ohio)-and ”let him
know he can travel to Managua
as soon as possible so his brother
can return with him to the Unit-
ed States and receive the needed
treatment,” it was reported in a
statement read to The Associated
Press.

Nicaraguan officials said after
Sam Hall's arrest near the Punta
Huete airbase, 13‘mi|es northeast
of Managua, that he had maps of
the installation in his shoe.

The congressman "feared his
brother would be put on trial and
sentenced to. more than the 30
years given to Eugene Hasenfus,
another American who was
pardoned Dec. 18 and released
in an act of clemency last
Christmas.

Hasenfus, the sole survivor of

_ an Oct. 5 airplane crash in which

  

three other men were killed, con-
fessed at a trial that he had been
smuggling weapons to anti-
government Nicaraguan rebels.

Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega turned Hasenfus over to
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd

(D-_

Conn.) and to Hasenfus’ wife,
Sally, at a ceremony in Managua.

Ortega said the release was ”a
Christmas message from the
Nicaraguan people to the people
of the United States, a very con-
crete message of peace.”

There was no immediate reac-
tion from the State Department to
the announcement that Hall
could go free.

U.S. relationswith Nicaragua
have been tense for years. The
Reagan administration, with sup-
port from Congress, is providing
military and other support to
Contra guerrillas at war with their
Sandinista government. ‘

The administration considers'_
the Sandinistas a Marxist dictator-

ship in league with the Soviet Un-
ion and Cuba and a threat to U.S.
security and non-communist
Central American states.

The Nicaraguan government
has rejected allegations that it is

Kuwait calls for an
end to Iran-Iraq war

NICOSIA, Cyprus — Iran said

« its troops turned a battle area

”into a graveyard for the Iraqi
forces” Monday, killing or
wounding 3,000 of the foe in a
push that brought Iran closer to
the southern Iraqi port city of
Basra.

Iraq retorted that Iran had not
advanced ”even a single inch"
and said the Iranians were
retreating.

The rival claims coincided with
the opening of a pan-Islamic sum-
mit in Kuwait, at which Kuwait's
ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-
Sabah, appealed to Iran and Iraq
to end the war.

”God beckons us to mediate"

‘and reconcile them,” he said.

Local woman dies in robbery

PITTSBURGH (AP). ~ A
91-year-old suburban Pittsburgh
woman who was robbed in her

‘home and left there tied for four

days has died, and the Alleghe-
ny County coroner Monday ruled
her death a homicide.

Marcella Chambers died early
Sunday in Suburban General
Hospital of blood clotting in her
lungs, said Deputy Coroner Dane
Allias. Coroner Joshua Perper
made the homicide ruling follow-
ing an autopsy, he said.

A 16-year-old boy and two
girls, ages 14 and 15, were
charged last week. No addition-
al charges were filed immediate-

ly following the homicide ruling,
said Allias. ‘

The teen-agers were being held
at the Shuman Juvenile Detention
Center in Pittsburgh. Their iden-
tities are being withheld, as they
are being prosecuted as juveniles.

The girls were charged with
burglary, robbery, recklessly en-
dangering another person, theft
and criminal conspiracy, accord-
ing to police. The boy was

-charged with robbery,_burg|ary

and aggravated assault, according
to police.

Ben Avon Police Chief Robert
Schoeber-discovered Mrs. Cham-
bers Jan. 18 on her bathroom

floor after a man who rents space
in her garage became suspicious
about a broken window, ac-
cumulated mail and no answer at
her door.

The woman's wrists had been
tied behind her. She was lying on
her back, unable to move, Schoe-
ber said. Mrs. Chambers, was
suffering from dehydration after
being left in the bathroom since
Jan. 14.

Police recovered several pieces
of jewelry from the teen—agers,
but other jewelry and cash appar-
ently were still missing, police
said.

SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — A
man watched television re-
plays of Pennsylvania state
Treasurer Budd Dwyer’s sui-
cide, then killed four young
women with a shotgun, police
told a court Monday. ' '

Detective Sgt. Harry Allum
told the Sydney court Richard
Maddrell had considered sui-
cide as he watched the replays
of Dwyer shooting himself be-

Fndav.

Maddrell, 27 and unem-
ployed, is charged with killing
twin sisters Kirsty and Jennifer
MacGregor, 19, their younger
sister Alexandra, 16, and
friend Lisa Chatterton, 19.

Suicide prompts killings

fore television cameras last.

Allum said Maddrell was a
paranoid schizophrenic, and
he was infatuated with Jennifer
MacGregor, who had rejected
his advances. '

On the day of the killings,
Maddrell_ parked his motorcy-
cle near the ~Mac.Gregor
house, assembled the shotgun
in nearby bushes, f’counted to
10 and walked to the door,”
Allum told the court.

According to his report, Jen-
nifer answered the door. Mad- .
drell said, ”Jenny , you don't ,
know how much you hurt me
and screwed me up, but the
dumb thing is I still love.you.”
Then he shot her in the head '
and killed the three others.

Jarvik used more astemporary device

By Marcia Dunn

Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH — After" four
years of replacing failing hearts
with Jarviks, doctors are looking
more and more at the plastic
pumps as a bridge to transplan-
tation. rather than "a permanent
substitute for the‘ living, beating
organ.

Even Dr. William Devries, the“.

guiding force behind permanent
implants, said he's ready and
willing to give short-term Jarviks
a shot.

’’I think we're in a very strong
position,” DeVries said. ”We can
do the bridge, but if a patient 
cannot be transplanted, we have

all the full facilities to keep them‘

as a permanent artificial heart
recipient.” .

”|t’s just perfect. One picks up
where the other leaves of,” he
said in a recent interview.

In his unquavering quest to do

' more permanent implants at Hu-

mana Hospital-Audubon in
Louisville, Ky., DeVries purpose-
ly is bypassing those who might

_ benefit from a new human heart.

”We’re looking for a patient
who is not a candidate for trans-
plantation,” he said. ”A couple
aren't sick enough yet. Some are
too sick. It's just a matter of wait-
ing until we get the right one. I
look at it as important enoughto
take our time.”

Despite a surge in procedures
and programs — 39 artificial

hearts were-implanted in seven
countries during the first 11
months of 1986, all as temporary
devices — doctors elsewhere said
they, too, are choosier than ever
in determining ‘who gets a
mechanical pump and why.
The risks, they say, are still far
too great, and the medical op-

._tions far too strong.

”The last thing we want to do
is put an artificial heart in a pa-
tient," said Dr. Bartley P. Griffith,
who has implanted 11 artificial

~ hearts at Presbyterian-University

Hospital, more than any other
American _surgeon.

With so many other surgical
techniquesavailable to keep pa-

tients going, using an artificial
heart except as a last resort is ”not I

just bad for the experiment, it's

overkill with a patient,” said Dr. .

O. Howard Frazier, who has im-
planted two Jarviks at the Texas
Heart Institute in Houston.

”It_’s like killing a spider with a
shotgun,” he said, noting that
some‘ protocol is needed for
choosing candidates.

Since the first artificial heart
was implanted in 1969 by Dr.
Denton A. Cooley, Frazier's as-
sociate at the Texas Heart Insti-
tute, 51 of the devices had been
used as of early December to sus-
tain dying patients, according to
the University of Utah's Dr. Don
Olsen, who keeps a world
registry.

Excellence makes freedom ring, and isn't that what we do
best. Imagine the preceding line followed by thunderous ap-
plause and a pretty accurate picture of the State of the Union
will come to mind. At least the state of the union that was the
subject of last night's address. I

In the early minutes of the speech, insipid rhetoric dominat-

ed. There were quotes from past presidents, stories and cute .

jokes. The speech had all the makings of a real box-office thriller.
That was not to be the case.

Reagan addressed the Iran-Contra affair with dignity and poise,
admitting that it was a mistake and vowing to take full respon-

_sibiIity.

His next lines, though, reflected our deepest sentiments; ”Let’s
get back to work.”
It is time for Congress to move past the scandal that has domi-

I nated so much of its time and address the issues it was elected

to confront. They must now look at the budget, the trade deficit
and the state of American foreign policy. _

The president did not ignorethe most politically important
issue of the past year, but asked that it not be given precedence
over the normal functioning of the government.

Reagan also reviewed a brief outline of his priorities for the

budget, stressing defense, trade reform, education, welfare and -

social security.

It was not a senile man that spoke this evening, nor one out
of touch with reality, he did not stumble or digress. The Presi-
dent we saw was one that appeared unsure" of the reception
with which his words would meet, but not a man unsure of
himself. He made no startling announcements, but he did not
shy from the pressing issues facing the nation.

In all, he looked a little better for the speech and more reflec-
tive than in past addresses. He seemed to be ready to make
his final two years in office productive ones and, he is to be
commended.

What happened
to those shanties?

There is good news from the divestment front, or so we are
to assume. Last term, Students for a Free South Africa pledged
to remain in their shanties until Pitt divested completely. From
the lack of new building on the William Pitt Union lawn, we
should be able to draw the conclusion that Pitt no longer has
holdings in South Africa.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Pitt continues to have money invested in companies doing
business in the apartheid region. Apartheid continues; people
continue to die. The visible support from the organizations at
Pitt has disappeared.

Did the weather turn too cold? Were there pest problems in
the shanties? Was there a decision to free the grass being killed
under the shanties? Did everyone stop caring? ‘

In the future, when and if the divestment campaign returns,
we will find it difficult to put much faith in the promises or
commitments of the student organizations.

Experience serves as the best teacher, so we are told. From
this experience, we have learned that the issue of divestment
is not as pressing as the weather. A less than favorable statement.

Don't count the eggs ...

The other day I was out bird-
watching (as I often do on Satur-
day mornings) when, as I gazed
through my binoculars at the top
of a blue spruce,-"I was surprised
to see a robin. What ‘a curious
find, I thought, to see a robin
around in the middlejof winter.
So I increased the magnification
of my binoculars and was even
more surprised to see what the
crazy bird was actually doing.

It was breaking its eggs. Now
this startled me, as I had never
seen a robin do this before —Jay
birds, yes (they're all crazy any-
waYl. but robins, never. Startled,
I quickly ran through the field and
climbed up the tree to question
this alarming bird.

”What are you doing?” I
chirped.

’’I’m having an abortion,” the
robin sang back.

”Why on earth would you do
that?” I shrieked. ”Don’t you
know that you're murdering poor
innocent fledglings?” ‘

”What?”she called back.
”They’re not babies, yet —
they're just eggs. Besides, as long
as they're not hatched, they're

remember the decision made by
the Supreme Birdbrains in the
Sparrow vs. Cardinal case in
1973?”

”That doesn't change the fact
that you're killing innocent ba-
bies,” I began to crow.

”PIease,” she sang, interrupting
me in mid—sentence, ’’call them
eggs, or at least fetuses. And I'm
not killing anything, I'm merely
terminating their incubancy.”

”Exact|y,” I cock|e-doodle-

you call them something else

Fraternity is trying

Your article and editorial car-
toon in the Jan. 28 issue of The
Pitt News presented, in our opin-
ion,an unfair view of our frater-
nity’s efforts. Our service
operated from Nov. 7, I986, un-
til the SGB meeting in early De-
cember, at which time the SGB’s
service was proposed.

The SGB’s plan as proposed at
the December meeting was virtu-
ally identical to our own service
in that it would not operate on
Friday or Saturday nights. Since
the SGB’s service had acces to
greater resources, and since we
were assured that their service
would commence the first-‘week
of the winter term, we assumed
that our service was no longer
needed.

We regret that we referred
several calls early this term to the
SGB service, before realizing that
the‘SGB service was not yet a

reality. We are still accepting
calls that come in and will con-
tinue to do so until the SGB serv-
ice shows us that our services are
no longer required.

Additionally, your editorial car-
toon and article unfairly overem-
phasized the statement by one of
our brothers concerning escorting
drunken women. We have not
and will not reject any caller
within the specified times of our
operation.

Our intent in starting the escort
service was to provide a service
to the Pitt community. If the serv-
ice has been lacking, it is merely
reflective of our limited manpow-
er and time. No other campus or-
ganization has stepped foreward

”Just because watching over
your eggs inconveniences you for

”By using that logic you can al-

Bull in the political abyss

The essence of my criticism of
any major state university is the
very deliberate‘manner in which
they exclude students from par—
ticipation in the design of curric-
ulum. After all, it is the students
going into hock in order to
finance their semesters‘. It is the
responsibility of the administra-
tion to encourage student in-
volvement in the scope and
choice of study.

I propose a mechanism to be
adopted. After voice vote in stu-
dent government, whereby stu-
dents can design‘ their own
curriculum for credit, regardless
of grade point average, and lob-
by other students for enrollment
in seminars that are not current-
ly being offered by the universi-
ty. The second mechanism will
be one whereby if, for example,

a student wishes to take a course‘

or seminar in Herman Melville,
and no such course’ is being
offered for two semesters, they
can attempt to find sufficient en-
rollment to that class by putting
a sign-up sheet ina selected lo-
cation. When and if sufficient en-
rollment is available, then the
university becomes obliged to
hire a professor for that course
within two semesters. Not that I
trust student judgment overmuch.
No doubt classes in Mick Jagger's
sex life will become popular, be-
cause there's something about
the abuse of power which fas-
cinates.

Let's not

Ronald Reagan is a goof.

Can we finally admit this?

We. voted him in and have
loved him for six years — his ten-
dency to hold his head cocked to’
one side and say, ”Well" fol-
lowed by a convoluted answer to
a reporter’s'question.

of Muppets fame is actually con-

trolling the man. I
Doinga wonderful impression

of Reagan at the podium, Wil—‘

liams has Henson underneath the
podium yelling, ”You moved
him too far!"

Is Williams right, or what?

I think so. Especially if the.

”you” in this case represents the
journalist in America.

Everyone, but everyone, wants
to know what happened with this
whole ”Arms for Iran, Cash for
the Contras” (as Dan Rather calls
it) deal. It's the biggest thing go-
ing on since Watergate.

Nixon didn't tell anyone about
what happened there, but that
was.OK because the Washington
Post found out.

Bob Woodward and Carl Bern-
stein were able to do so partly be-
cause they were inexperienced
and didn't cover the White
House. Becoming a veteran
reporter in Washington often
means learning what to ask and
what not to ask.

Because they didn't know any
better, they used journalism skills.
as they should be used and found
out what happened. If they
hadn't, things would be as they
are today. .

Nothing is wrongwith the cur-

to Reagan, I

JAMES CRARY

The abuse of power within a
bureaucracy comes from those
who do not understand what they
are involved in and those who do
understand. Such abuse, in the
extreme, leads to the phenome-
non of public servants operating
under an authoritarian regime,
claiming that they are ’just obey-
ing orders’ when they kill,
Poland's Jews, for example.

Bureaucracy, as such, has a
motivating power which is not
human —— i_t is mechanical. This

I is as true for the University of

Pittsburgh, as for the best and
worst of governments. The hu-
man beings who function effec-
tively -within bureaucracy
function, on some level, mechan-
ically. This is as necessary to
bureaucracy, just as light and air
are necessary to plants. Light and
air are not necessary to
bureaucracy, just vist Falk ”Med-
ical” Library if you don't believe
me.

_ The only really effective way of
changing the potential for abuse
within a bureaucratic status quo
is by checks and balance. That is
why the necessary feedback
mechanisms within a university,

for student participation in curric- .

ulum is vital.
This point goes beyond the
university into the web of

bureaucrats within the military-
industrial complex of the United
States of America, a relatively de-
cent nation/state, as far as na-
tion/states go. In the MIC, there
are roughly $25 billion worth of
classified projects scheduled for
next year. Could they be the great
good for mankind, a harvest of
bounty and boon for the honor of
the national enigma? Could they
be the hidden hand for the har-
bingers of apocalypse, the mor-
dant insanity of totalitarians, as so
many fear—mongering liberals
would profess? No way to find
out, which is comforting.

There are debates in - phil-
osophy about the nature of truth,
the nature of man, the nature of
politics. Well, philosophy aside,
there remains the self-evident
truth that all men are created
equal. This equality includes stu-
dents and public servants. ’

In_ the film Diva, the pro-
tagonist, the Frenchman named
Gorodish, picks up his telephone
and is informed violently that
”the patience of the bull is great
and so is his might." To which

_ Gorodish replies, ”Abyssus abys-

sum invocat.” Meaning, the
abyss calls forth the abyss. Partic-
ipation, politeness and theright
to know are the only ways to foil
the extremists, who call upon the
bull and bring on the abyss in
sw\aggering boldly and asserting
"false doctrines candidly.

DIRK
KAUFMAN

The fact of the matter is, every-
thing is wron_g. I

Using true government wis-
dom, our leaders have let the
government investigate itself.
Worse yet, journalists are letting
it happen.

When the story first broke,
there were many headlines and
much talk of the scandal. Shortly
thereafter, there was more talk,
criticizing press coverage than on
the story itself.

The Reagan administration
committed a huge violation of
our trust. Rather than realize the
significance of the violation, the
public instead criticized the press
— and it seems the press was
frightened into avoiding the sto-

’ry and letting the government

handle the case.

The justice system in this coun-
try contends that one is innocent
until proven guilty. The press is
a part of that justicesystem. Many
might say it isn't. It was with
Watergate — and it should be
with any government scandal.

Instead, we find the press
cowering in a corner, waiting for
some strange sign of approval
from the masses.

It seems to be an approval no
one will give. In America we
don't want to know when some-
thing has gone wrong. In Ameri-
ca everything is flowing streams
and majestic mountains and the
vision of communists going to
hell while our democratic socie-
ty is lifted up by the hand of God.

It's a silly vision.because, for all g

our good traits, we are not per-

 

' fect. The press reports on the so-

ciety._every day. It knows this.

So why the hesitation?

Perhaps it is becausethere is a
fear that people-in this country
will suddenly stop reading the
newspapers or watching the
news. The thing publishers fear
isn't a society without
knowledge. They fear walking
about with no money in their

. pockets. . .

It's funny when I hear people
complain about the amount of
advertising in this paper. This
paper is different in a way be-
cause students are writing for it
in order to learn. It's primary rea-
son for existence isn't to make a
profit, though profit is certainly a
consideration.

Professional newspapers and
television stations in this country,
howeverfexist to make a profit.
Should the public suddenly de-
cide it hates the newsman, the
publisher wouldn't run and con-
sole his writers, he would give
the public what it wants. He
would do what it takes to keep
the cash flowing.

It's time to put this fear aside
and write some good, solid. sto-
ries about Reagan and this
Iran/Contra affair. Although they
act otherwise, the public wants to
know — and it should know.

No one’s going to tell us out- '

right, but we shouldn't feel guilty
about wanting to know. We can
have our majestic mountains and
flowing streams and a responsi-
ble government at the same time.

Indeed we have, but if we are

”Heather has been doing this for over a year,” her mother

said. ”The 35 copies of The Family News are read by 73 peo-
ple in nine states who range from 6 to I02." , ‘

I guess the reason I like. The Family News so much is the tone

of its subject matter. It seems that every other publication I read
depresses me, with stories about the cruelty and meanness of
mankind. The Family News‘, on the other hand, never fails to
_bring a smile to my face. I am not a part of Heather Cook's fa-
mily, but somehow the things she writes make me feel good.

Here is a sampling of some items from recent issues of The

S Family News:

Kevin is in first place in his conference in golf. He is glad!‘

Annette and Larry joined a bottle club, and they spend a lot .
of weekends going to bottle shows. Larry collects antique ginger
beer bottles; Annette collects old glass candy jars; and they both
collect all kinds of stoneware.

Matt got his second tooth. He scoots around the floor to get

where he wants to go. If you hold his hands, he will move his

\

legs ‘like he is going to walk. , r

Mike went to California on a business trip.
Aunt Lenore broke her right arm. We hope it is healing well.

Crandma,.Heather and Kevin raked leaves and burned them _
in the backyard. It smoked so much it was up the street!

Steve got a new van! It is dark.blue, and you could almost

even live in it! He got it because Steve and Scott spend a lot
_ of weekends working at car races. It is very nice.

Anne is taking driver's education. She can only practiceiwith

Now obviously, that is not the kind of news that you would

find in a metropolitan newspaper. But Heather’s.mother thinks .
that is precisely the reason The Family News has such an avid
audience. '

”I don't know whether Heather is a budding journalist ortnot,"
her mother said. ”When she started putting The Family

Newsout, I didn't expect it to last. She's a very quiet kid. "But /

obviously it means a lot to’ her.

”I run the paper off on our copying machine at work. Then
Heather colors in the drawings by hand. Everyone in our fami-
ly likes it so much — my brother-in-law Tom donated the money
to buy the stamps for us to send it out. And my‘Unc|e Frank, '
who writes to no one, wrote Heather aletter asking her the keep
The Family News going. He said it's the most important news ,
he gets.”-

I spoke with Heather; I told her that it was pretty impressive,
being a newspaper editor at the age of 8.

’’I think The Family News kind of keeps our family together,” v
Heather said. ”Every month I call people up to see what's new
— if they went to a party or something. When they tell me what ~
they've been doing, I write it all down as notes. Then I put it
in the next issue. I ‘ Li

”I don’t'think there's any comparison between The Family

I News and a real newspaper. A real newspaper is all about the

city and the world, and my newspaper is just about my family.

_ I know that nothing that I put in The Family News would ever

qualify to get printed in a real newspaper, but allmy uncles
and aunts and cousins tell me to keep putting itout, so I do.”

Heather said that she doesn't look upon the job of editing »
The Family News as a chore. ”I look forward to it,” she said.
”I think it's fun. The best thing about it is hearing how much
it means to the people in my family. Our family keeps getting
bigger, and I plan on doing this until I get really old, like 18.”

Heather's mother said that sometimes she will offer her daugh-

.ter advice on what to put in the newspaper.

”|’ll say, ‘Heather, why don't you write such-and—such or such-
and—such?’ And she'll say, ’Mom who's the editor of this
newspaper, anyway?’ ” '

I reiterated to Heather_’s mother how much I liked The Fami-
ly News.

”|’ll tell you what I think it is,” she said. ”A metropolitan"
newspaper, as big and complete as it is, you know that nobody’s

J reading every word of it. But with The Family News, every sub-

scriber is reaingaevery word of every issue.”

In preparation for meeting with

ferred several times with White
House counsel Peter Wallison
and his aides, who have been try-
ing to produce a chronology of
the°arms deal and the skimming
of profits for the rebels.

Reagan and the aides ”dis-
cussed the reconstruction of
events as nearly as they have
been able to restructure them,"-
said White House spokesman
Larry Speakes. "The president
had an opportunity to refresh his
recollections on it."

Speakes also said "there was

’ absolutely no attempt” by Regan

to mislead Secretary of State Ge-
orge P. Shultz about the arms y
deal with Iran.

In early May, while attending
the economic summit meeting of
seven industrialized countries in
Tokyo, Shultz received a cable
from Charles H. Price II, the U.S.
ambassador to Great Britain, in-
forming him of a possible U.S.
arms deal with Iran for the release -
of the hostages.

by Saudi Arabian arms merchant
Adnan Kashoggi and that Regan
was not aware of that specific
transaction, although he had

earlier in which the president

Continued from page 1
is equipped with three-quarter
inch protective glass and rolling
steel windows to guard the em-
ployees and property. In addition,
all library guards in Brooklyn are

. armed;

At a recent American Libraries
Security conference, Wilkinson
spoke to a [Canadian delegate
who said he was at the confer-
ence to find out what U.S. cities
were experiencing. He said he
expected Canadian libraries to
encounter the same difficulties in
15 years. «

”The stuff they're facing ‘in
New York, Chicago and L.A is ap-
palling,” Wilkerson said. ”If it's
happening there, I'll see it in 10
years.”

One day about three years ago,
Wilkerson received a phone call
from his wife, a librarian at the
East Liberty branch. She wanted
to know if she should call the city
police because a nude man was
standing in the men's room,
washing his clothes in a toilet.

Not long ago at the Oakland
branch, a female guard chased a
man in drag out of the women's
rest room.

”A lot are alcoholics,” Wilkin-
son said of the problem patrons.
”We get a lot of complaints about
indecent exposure in the stacks,

’ and it's difficult to patrol every

area because the building is so
large, and it sometimes gets very
busy at the main lending desk.”

According to the ‘Library Crime
Research Project, a three—year
study of crime and disruption pat-
terns in nearly -3,000 public
libraries, one respondent noted
”You [in the study] do not men-
tion the‘ presence in libraries of
mentally disturbed people. They
do some fairly strange things 
But people like that have to have
some haven too. I just hide the
big art books when I see them
coming.”

Many of the mentally disturbed
are homeless ”bag ladies" and
”bums” who seek the shelter of
a public building to avoid the dis:
comforts of inclement weather‘,
and a hostile public.

”We get our highest [number
of] incidents involving street peo-
ple in fall and spring,” Wilkinson
said. ’’I usually get complaints
about the smell." L

He related—one incident when

he had to "eject a woman. When
he asked her to step into the hall
to discuss the situation, she be-
came very defensive and
demanded to know why she was
being ejected. Wilkinson asked

her,‘ ”Wouldn’t you rather go out-

side and talk about it?” But the
woman refused to leave and
demanded to know why she was
being thrown out.

Wilkinson answered, ”Because
you have head lice.” As soon as
he spoke, three or four magazines
flapped shut, and everyone left
the room.

Occasionally, Wilkinson has
been forced to invoke a ”Defiant
Trespassing” law which allows
him to ”order someone out with
cause.” In such a situation, the
case must go before a magistrate.
In 1981, Wilkinson appeared in
court nine times in an effort to
eradicate library rule breaking.

Alan Jay Lincoln, author _of
Crime in the Library, said, ”From
the perspective of managing an
institution, arson is perhaps the

.most devastating Crime” that can

occur. In fact, the Burns Security
Institute study constructed in the
early 1970s listed arson as the
greatest threat to libraries.’’

In his own jurisdiction, Wilkin-

son has confirmed two cases of -

arson, one in Beechview and the
other at the Woods Run branch.

Even more damaging to the
Carnegie’s collection are the
costs incurred by stolen and mu-
tilated books.

”What is stolen varies between

each section of the city,” Wilkin- .

son said. "In the black areas, it's
tough to keep books on the shelf
about Islam, while here in Oak-
land, with a large number of stu-
dent patrons, many reference

The main branch in Oakland is
presently the only‘ building
manned 24 hours a day. Oakland
is also the only branch with a
book detection . system, which
sets off an alarm whenever some-
one leaves with an uncharged
book.

Wilkinson said he would like
to hire more full—time guards and
more former police officers. He
also maintains a close relation-
ship with supporting police; the
East Libery branch supplies free
coffee for the local beat officer
and always keeps a dog dish
ready for the officer's K-9 com-
panion.

”We don't aquire

”This department is like a birth

doesn't work.”

were men, and the average age
was 41, Olsen said. Fourteen of
the patients have died.

Only five of the pumps, all Jar-
viks, were implanted on a perma-
nent basis. Four were implanted
by DeVries, who has approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to permanently
replace seven hearts with Jarviks.
The fifth was done in Sweden.

The first person to receive a
permanent artificial heart, Barney
Clark, survived for 1-12 days fol-
lowing his implant on Dec. 2,

A 1982. Of DeVries’ three other pa-

tients, Bill Schroeder lived the
longest — 620 days.

Many people, including physi-
cians, question the four patients’
quality of life while they were
tethered through air hoses to a"
large power source. The men
were plagued by blood clots and
strokes, and none of them ever
came close to resuming a normal
life as have many artificial heart
recipients who later received hu-
man organs.

The first person to receive a Jar-
vik as an interim device in autho-

rized. surgery,
Drummond, 27, of Phoenix,
Ariz., is working at a grocery

store 17 months following his im- '

plant. The second,‘ Thomas
Gaidosh, 48, of Sutersville, Pa.,
is back in the driver's seat of a
forklift. ’ _ '

Despite such success stories,
DeVries bristles at the notion that’
his patients’ pains outweighed
their gains.

"They had a better quality of’ A
life than they ever -had with the - i 1

disease. The quality of life debate
goes on with emphasis from peo— '
ple who really don't know what
happened,” he said.

’’If you look at the progress of . A

the four patients, that's more suc-
cess than any type of medical
device in history,” he added.
”Sure the patients have died and
sure the patients had expectations
and everyone else had expecta-
tions. But they [implants] have
had-phenomenal success and ex-
ecuted what has gone on.”
Griffith agrees permanent im-
plants have paved the way for the
temporary use of Jarviks. But he

sees less need now to permanent-
ly use the device, at least until a
more sophisticated, tether-free
model comes along. ~

He reported his finding, based
on his first six Jarvik implants, in
thelan. 15 issue of the New Eng-
land journal of Medicine.

”The initial -experiment and
chronic use of the device hap-
pened at a time when heart trans-
plantation had not incorporated
older patients, didn't incorporate
patients with diabetes and with a
degree of lung disorders who cur-
rently we’l| accept,” he said. ”TO—
day probably most of the patients
who had (permanent) artificial

   

hearts would be considered as
potential candidates for heart
transplantation.”

While artificial hearts are mere-
ly ”halfway technology” "and
should not supersede research to
prevent cardiac disease, heart
transplantation ”is a very good
treatment, at least to compare
others to,” Griffith said.

”But because we are having
more and more transplant
centers, and older people are be-
ing offered the procedure with a
real limitation in terms of donor
organs available, somethinghas
to fill the gap,” he said.

Americans a year could benefit

So far, the FDA has granted
permission to eight heart trans-

' plant centers, including Humana

Hospital-Audubon, to use the
Jarvik-7 or the scaled-down

Jarvik—70 on an emergency basis A

while human hearts are sought.

At most, 15 of the nation's 80
to 90 heart transplant Centers will
be allowed to use the Jarvik as an
investigational, bridge device, ac-
cording to Abhijit Acharya, direc-
tor of the FDA’s division of
cardiovascular devices.

’’Our preliminary estimate is
that we need 50 patients fol-
lowed for one year after their
transplants” before deciding
whether more trials are needed,
he said.

Only one institution, the Penn-
sylvania State University’s Milton
S. Hershey Medical Center, has
FDA permission to use its own
specially designed device. The
Penn State heart, similar in design
to thelarvik, has been implanted
into two people as a bridgeto

Reagan admits mistakes
were made in Iran deal

By Terence Hunt
AP White House Correspondent

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said last night that his
failed effort to reach out to Iran
and win the release of American
hostages in Lebanon was his
”one major regret” but he called
on the nation not to be ”obsessed
with failure.”

With American military ships
on the move in the Mediterrane-
an Sea, Reagan, .in his sixth an-
nual State of the Union address,
also vowed not to sit idly by ’’if
our interests or friends in the Mid-
dle East are threatened  by ter-
rorist blackmail. , ’

He said it was not wrong to try
to establish Contact with a nation
of strategic importance and ”Cer-
tainly it was not wrong to try to
securefreedoms for our citizens
held in barbaric captivity. But we
did not achieve what we wished,
and serious mistakes were made
_in trying to do so.’’

’’I took a risk with regard to our
action in ‘Iran. It did not work and
for that I assume full responsibil-
ity,” Reagan said in his prepared
‘text.

 

 

While defending his intiative,
Reagan did not Offer any new

revelations about the arms’ sale‘

and later diversion of profits to
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
While pledging to find out the
facts and take any necessary ac-
tion,- Reagan said that ”in debat-
ing the past, we must not deny
ourselves successes of the future.
Let it never be said of this gener-
ation of Americans that we be-
came so obsessed with failure
that we refused to take risks that

I Could further the cause of peace

and freedom in the world.

”Much is at stake here and the
nation and the world are watch-
ing -— to see if we go forward
together in the national interest,
or if we let partisanship weaken
us,” Reagan said.

a’

He added: ”Let there be no 1

mistake about American policy:
We will not sit idly by if our in-
terests or our friends in the Mid-

dle East are threatened, nor will _

we yield to terrorist blackmail.”

Concluding his remarks on the
subject, Reagan said, ”Now, la-
dies and gentlemen of the Con-
gress, why don't we get to
work?”

Eating Concernsoffers support

By Lisa Hallman

For The Pitt News

Editor's Note: Full names were
not used in the following article
in order to protect the individu-
als whom provided necessary in-
sight into the problem of eating
disorders.

. Eating Concerns is a support
group for students with eating dis-
orders at Pitt, CMU, Carlow and
Chatham. The group does not try
to solve the problems of the
members, instead,. they try to be
understanding and let the mem-
bers know they are not alone.

”My father is very domineer-

ing, he wanted total control of my
life,” said Nikki, a freshman at
Pitt. ”This was my‘way of con-
trolling my life, and I also got a
lot of attention.”

Nikki has_ been attending the
weekly meetings of Eating Con-
cerns since September. She has
been in therapy for two years and
has been hospitalized three times
for her eating problems. Nikki
said the group is very supportive
of her because, ”there are people
there that understand the
problem.”

Eating Concerns is sponsored
by the Student Health Service in

Disorders.

The group is led by Lisa, a
recovering anorexic. Lisa, who is
a graduate student at Pitt, prefers
to be called a facilitator because
the group is for support and dis-
cussion. Lisa said that many peo-
ple who have eating disorders

- feel they are alone in dealing with
their problems and most don't
even tell their families and friends
that they have a problem.

Many friendships have formed
as a result of the group, accord-
ing to some of the members.»
They have _formed phone lines
and often call each other outside
of the meetings when they need
support. ’

Many members feel alienated
from society because their
problem is a ’’lone type of disord-
er,” said Lisa. People ”stalk the
room out for months" before they
get up the courage to go in.

Lisa said that parents often call
and ask her to talk to their kids,
but it's essential that the person
first be ”ready to confront the
problem.” She said many stu-
dents attend the meetings and
listen, but they still won't admit
they have a problem. ,

Tamara, 34, has been attending
the meetings since the summer of
1985. ”The meetings are in a
very non-threatening environ-
ment, and you're over the hurdle

-til recently.

once you come to a meeting,”
she said.

Tamara has been suffering from
anorexia and bulimia for over 10
years. She said that the eating dis-
orders were not talked about un-
’’I thought my
problem was unique,” she said.

Most of the group members
thought they were alone before

they found Eating Concerns.‘

”Basically they just tell us we are
OK people,” said Meg, a junior
from Pitt.

She also .said people should not
be afraid to come to the meetings
because it is a new situation.
”We are there to hold your hand
and offer you support,” said.Meg.

Eating Concerns meets every

Tuesday from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. ‘

in room 514 of the Student Un-
ion. The group consists of eight
to 10 women, but Lisa stresses
that the group is also open to
men.

Eating Concers offers other
services to its members aside
from the support. They have
referral lists of Pittsburgh doctors

- who will help the members with

any medical problems that might
arise because of their eating dis-
orders. They also can refer mem-
bers to other support groups or

give them reference materials,’

newsletters or books to help them
understand their problem better.

THE PITT NEWS

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Joe
Greene, known as Mean Joe
when he captained the Pittsburgh
Steelers’ four Super Bowl cham-
pionship teams, said making the
Pro Football Hall of’ Fame didn't
become important until his 1981
retirement.

Greene, elected Tuesday to the
Hall of Fame in his first year of
eligibility, said his induction this

August in Canton, Ohio, is im— ‘

portant to me. ’’I want my place
in history. lreally do.”

”I thought I had a pretty good
career. I thought I played some
pretty good football,” Greene
said. ”A.few years ago, I would
have had a hard time saying that,
but I can sayit comfortably now.
I'm just thankful that other peo-
ple saw it and that I was consi-

dered for this great honor. I
appreciate it.”

In a telephone interview short-
ly after the induction announce-
ment was made, Greene said, ”I
have had a few momentous
events in my life with [the Steel-
ers], and this is one of them.”

Greene didn't think much
about achieving pro football's
highest honor while he was be-

ing elected to 10 Pro Bowls, in-
cluding eight in a row from
1970-77, in his 13 NFL seasons.

”I didn't play pro football to
make All-Pro or to make the Hall
of Fame,” said Greene, whose
No. 75 is still wornaby Steelers’
fans on replica jerseys. ”I‘played
to have fun and make a living. It
would be a frail and weak exis-
tence _if the purpose of playing

 

was to achieve those goals.”
Greene was called ”Joe Who?’-.’.
by some Steelers’ fans when the
largely unknown North ‘Texas
State defensive tackle became the
first player drafted by then-rookie

Jerome Lane and Rod Brookin ‘look onlas teammate Charles Smith dunks,

Orange crushed  
Panthers hand yracuse Big

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

SYRACUSE N.Y., — In what
can be called their most satis-
fying win since their induction
into the Big East, the Pitt Pan-
thers toppled the Syracuse
Orangemen, 84-70, in the

I Syracuse Carrier Dome on
Monday night.

Pitt improved its record to
15-4 overall and 4-2 in Big
East play, while Syracuse
dropped to 17-2 and 6-1.

In many ways, this win
seemed like a revelation to
manyofthe Panther players —
including the team's stars. _

”This is very big for us,” said
Panther center Charles Smith.
”As a matter of fact, this is
almost like ‘icing on the cake’
after our win against Boston
College the other night. We
had to prove it to ourselves
that we could come here and

g win a big road game like this.
And we did.”

"I think we really showed
something tonight,” said the
game's obviously deserving
MVP, Jerome Lane, who had
an astounding 26 total points
and 15 rebounds. ”A|though

we've been having some trou- .

ble lately, we never take any
team I-ightly, and especially
not ‘big’ teams like Syracuse.
If we continue what we have
done‘ during the past two
games, we should not lose
another game in the Big East.”

Going into the game, the
17th-ranked Panthers knew
what they had ahead of them.
Coach Jim Boeheim’s Orange-
men have been making
tremendous strides in victory
lately - enough to be ranked
7th in the country. But if this
caused the Panthers to be in.-

East loss,

, were able to use this to our ad-

timidated, it certainly didn't
show, for they went out gun-
ning and never let up.

”I think we really saw some
great performances from some
of our players tonight, espe-
cially Jerome [Lane] and
Charles [Smith],” said Pitt ,
head coach Paul Evans. .
”We’ve had a little trouble in
the Big East lately. A win like .
this really gives the kids some
confidence.”

”Our game plan was actual-
-ly quite simple,” continued
Evans. ”We saw Vi-Ilanova
play the zone against them,
and what we did was try to im—
itate this. We got inside quite
often and quite well, and we

vantage and control the cycle
of the game.”

At the outset of the game,
the Panthers looked prepared
but cautious, as the Orange-
men seemed to be setting the
pace for the shooting in the
first two minutes of play. A
technical foul against Evans
even gave omens of another
down-to—the-wire game such
as the one against St. John's
last week. But. a three-point
goal by point guard Mike
Goodson at 17:17 started a
roll that Syracuse couldn't ‘
stop. , .

”I think you could say that"
is really where the turnaround
occurred because that is when
we really started to slap on the
points,” said co-captain guard
Curtis Aiken, who scored 12
points. ”The way we per-
formed after that goal really
proved to us that our confi-
dence was in full gear, and I
think Syracuse could tell this
because instead of us, they
then became the underdogs.” e

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Pitt basket-
ball fanatics envisioned it in their
worst dreams. They could see
Syracuse forward Derrick Cole-
man and center Rony Seikaly

-wheeling and dealing on Pitt's
- front line of Charles Smith and

Jerome Lane.

What made matters worse is I

the fact that the gameewould be

 

played at the Carrier Dome‘ on
the campus of Syracuse Univer-
sity. The Panthers have never
won a Big East game there, and
Smith, the squad’s ‘star center,
had played poorly in his previous
two games in that arena.
Seikaly and Coleman should
both have field days —- or, so it
was thought. .
Think again. . .
When the final horn sounded
at the Carrier Dome on Monday,

it was the 26,343 regulars who
left with their-heads hung low,
and two others — Smith and Lane
— who stood tall.

”We came in confident,”
Smith said. ”We wanted to prove
to ourselves thay we can win on
the road.”

And ‘that they did. Lane, a
sophomore from Akron, Ohio,
scored 26 points on 11 of 12

shooting from the field.”'He also I

and 13 rebounds. I

Greece, played only 24 minutes;

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team dowhed the Lady Bear-
cats of St. Vincent's College,
95-78, at ‘Fitzgerald Field House
on Monday night.

The 17-point margin of victory
was Pitt's largest this season.
However, that statistic hasn't had
much competition. Although the
win is Pitt's second in the past
five games, it is only their fifth this
season.

The Lady Panthers are playing
at .500 out of the conference 5-5,
but are winless in the Big East
0-8.

The loss dropped St. Vincent's
to 13-5 on the season.

”lt’s good that we won, but you
couldn't play any worse than we
did in the first half,” said Pitt
coach Kirk Bruce.

Pitt made only 35 percent of its
shots from the floor in the first
half, while St. Vincent's hit 57
percent of its field goals and 73
percent of its foul shots. Due to
their superior shooting, the Lady

Bearcats led at halftime, 43-37.

The Lady Panthers appeared to
be in danger of losing yet another
game, and they definitely weren't
living up to the coach's goals.
”We went into the game with a
few definite goals,” said Bruce.
”We wanted to play hard for 40
minutes and get five girls in dou-
ble figures [scoring].

’’I don't believe that we con-
centrated more than half of the
time we were on the court,” he

.added.

But a 14-7 run at the outset of
the second half gave Pitt a 51-50
lead with 14:16 remaining.
Although the Lady Bearcats took
the lead once again at 56-55, Pitt
controlled the rest of the action.
The Lady Panthers had scoring
streaks of 10-2 and 21-10 in the

last 10 minutes to put the game A

away.

The Lady Panthers did surpass
one of their coach's goals when
six players scored in double
figures, accounting for all of Pitt's
95 points.

with a career high 24 points.’

”l’ve never been more proud of
a player than I am of Amy,”
Bruce said. ”She’s probably mad
because she missed a few shots
or only made six of seven from
the free throw line — that's what
type of player she is.”
Holman’s play comes at a crit-

A ical time because she is filling in

lead to 12, 31-19, at 6:56 in the '

first half. Pitt jumped to its biggest

. lead —' and Syracuse faced its big-

gest deficit of the season — at

2:26 of the half when the Pan- A

thers’ Rodney Brooki_n hit a jum-
per to put Pitt up, 43-27.

In the second half, Syracuse
could never get closer than nine
points as the Panthers outmanned
the Orange. _

Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim
said he felt this override by the
Panthers was the key factor in the
destruction of his players’ confi-
dences.

”Pitt obviously has some
tremendous players, and tonight
they all had tremendous plays,”
said Boeheim, ”At the half, we
went into the locker room down
only by nine [actually 11] and I
thought we could regain what we
were already losing. But we
couldn't. For every good play we
had, they matched with tw
better." . _ ‘

Pitt did an especially effective
job on Orangeman star center
Rony Seikaly, who only had six
points as well as six rebounds.
Boeheim said he could not give
an exact reason why Seikaly did
not perform as he was expected
— except for the dominating Pitt
defense.

”Both Rony’s and the whole
team's biggest problem was our
offense,” said ‘ Boeheim. ”Pitt
showed a "sound, compact and
strong team, and their tremen-
dous defense really shut us down.
Smith and Lane dominated that
court, and I think this took some

_ of our players by surprise and

probably Rony most of all.”
But Lane felt differently.

”Seikaly was‘ going man-to—.

man on Charles in almost every
play of the game, and I think
Charles really showed him some-
thing,” said Lane. ”Charles has

more moves than Seikaly, and I‘
think that was obvious tonight.”

Now six games into their Big -

East schedule, the Panthers are
beginning to show what was ex-
pected of them at the outset of the
season — that they are a definite
contender to win the Big East ti-
tle. Boeheim even predicted Pitt
to win during the preseason. And
with confidences high and out-
standing performances by Lane
and crew, this prediction may just

Rod Brookin and Curtis Aiken

turn into a reality.

”I think we're proving we're
just as good if not better than any
other team and we are no longer
the underdogs,” said Evans.
”We’re Pitt, and that's saying
something.” . A

Greene quickly established him-
self as ”the greatest defensive
lineman to ever play the game.

”And he was the greatest cap-
tain inthe history of professional
sports,” Perles, a former Steelers’
assistant, told the Beaver County
Times.

A ”He was the leader of the Steel-
ers,” Steelers President Dan
Rooney told The Pittsburgh Press.
”He might have been the greatest
leader I ever saw in the football
business.” ‘

Perles said Greene -was ”the
glue who held everything
together” when the World Foot-
ball League failed to sign away

_ any of the Steelers’ stars in 1974.

”Undoubtedly, he was more
responsible than any other in-
dividual for the fact the Steelers
had very few internal troubles,”
said Joe Gordon, the Steelers’
business manager. ”That’s one of
the reasons why the Steelers won
four Super Bowls in six years,"
why no one has repeated win-
ning [the Super Bowl] since.

”Joe knew how to focus on
what was important, and he
didn't allow distractions to affect

it. He demanded that wewin,
and he ordained it. Noll preached

it, and Joe Greene enforced,it,’.7 '

defense, in- which Greene lined .

up in a slant over the-center
rather than overtop a guard, was
unveiled by Perles before the

championship game against the
Oakland Raiders. '

With Greene constantly power-
ing his way into the backfield, the
Steelers combined to holdthe
Raiders and Super Bowl oppo-

rushing yards.

Carrier Dome. -

When you view the facility
from the outside, it is easy to real-
ize just how seriously these peo-
ple take their basketball. Once
you get inside, it is even easier.

A curtain spans the 50-yard line
of the Tartan Turf football field.
On one side is the basketball
floor. On the other side, called
”The Backcourt,” is an enormous
P3”Y-

Evidently, the athletic adminis-
tration at Syracuse University has
a lot of confidence in the Tartan
surface of the football field. Prior
to each home game, approxi-
mately 80-percent of the
25,000-plus fans venture down
on the field for this party at ’’The
Backcourt.” ,

The entire end zone is a con-
cession stand. Bottled beer (eight
import brands and three domes-
tic brands) goes for $1.25. Any-
thing from pizza to nachos can
accompany your brew.

As you venture up towards the
curtain at midfield, you run
across a big screen television —
as big as the screen in your typi-
cal movie theater. If your seats

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
will put its undefeated record
(8-0) on the line tomorrow night
at Fitzgerald Field House against
Cleveland State at 7:30. The Pan-
thers are coming off an upset win
at Lock Haven University last
Saturday by a score of 22-19.

The win over Lock Haven was
especially important because it
was Pitt's first win of the season
in the Eastern Wrestling League.

Up to this point in the season,
Pitt has had a tough schedule and
has been able to remain un-
defeated with big victories over _ ____ .
Lock Haven and perennial D0w-  .. ..   "" " , j._ , v .7 V j .-
er Lehigh. But the real test of the ‘ I
Panthers’ ability still lies ahead.

”Dual meets are fun, but what
really counts are the tournaments
after the season.” said Pitt coach
Rande Stottlemyer. ”That’s what
we gear our training for. The dual
meets are exciting to watch; they
help the guys get ready for the big
ones.”

Although the team is undefeat-
ed, many of the Pitt wrestlers see
room for improvement. “Every-
body has room to improve at this
point,” said senior captain Eric
Wertz. ’’I think that everyone will
in the long run.”

”The last two meets showed
that we are not at our peak yet,”
added senior co-captain Gary Bo-
lin. ”We just did what we had to
do to win. The way that our train-
ing schedule is structured, we
can't help but improve.”

The Panthers win over Lock
Haven moved Pitt into the llth
spot on the latest Amateur,
Wrestling News poll.

”We deserved to win that
one," said Stottlemyer. ”We

Wertz. ’’It was a good all around
effort, but Alan really got the
team going.”

’’I had to work pretty hard in
that match,” said Utter. ”The
pressure was on me, because I
wasn't even supposed to be close
in the match. Yet, I felt confident.
Now I'll have to build on that.”

After Utter’s close victory, it
was all Pitt. The Panthers won the
next three matches with sopho-
more Pat Santoro (142 pounds),
who is 30-1 on the year, Bolin
(150) and Wertz (158) all

winning.

”This part of the line-up, I call
‘The Wall.’ They just go out there
and win,” commented Stott-
lemyer about his tandem of wres-
tlers in the middle weight classes.

With Pitt's unblemished record
on the line, Stottlemyer knows his
team isn't in a position to take
anyone for granted — including
Cleveland State. ”We’ll have to
fight like dogs to_win. Their team
matches up really well with
ours,” said Stottlemyer. ”lf w = get
the intensity, it will be anotner
win. If we are not up, we will ge;
beat. This is another league meet,
so it will be even tougher.”

competes at home.

One of these obstacles is that
a Penn State meet always brings
in a huge crowd no matter who
the competition is. And, because
of the huge rivalry between these
two schools, the crowd could be
even larger than usual.

It seems the Pitt—Penn State
rivalry_is ages old, and whenever
Pitt competes against Penn State
it is an all out fight to the finish.
The Lady Panthers Gymnastics
Team realizes this as it travels to
Penn Stateﬂtonight to compete.

In 1985, the Lady Panthers beat
Penn State, and last year, the
Lady Lions took a close victory
over their opponents. This year,
however, the Lady Panthers be-
lieve they can overcome a multi-
tude of obstacleswhich always
seem to occur when Penn State

Senior Alisa Spector knows that
the crowd can both be a help as
well as a hindrance to a gymnast.
Spector plans to use the crowd to
her advantage so that she will
perform better.

Spector;

faced is that Penn State has al-
ready scored 180 points, a goal
which Pitt is still striving for.

’’I’m a little nervous about
competing because of the large
rivalry between Pitt and Penn
State,” said junior team member
Teresa Garcia. ”However, we're
prepared and we've increased
our team score in every meet so
far.”

Sophomore Trish Aser has her
own rivalry going on tonight be-

ting psyched up.”

All the gymnasts and the

achieve a win tonight. Freshman
Shelly Sleith said, ’’If everybody
hits we can win, we just have to
keep it all together.”

Similarly, Aser said, ”The win
will go to whoever hits. If we hit,
we should win. If we both hit, it
will be verv. very close.”

”l think that we can beat
them,” said Garcia. ”lt’s a mat~

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 28, I987

 Highs and lows of the 1986 NFL season

By Thomas Danyluk -

Assistant Sports Editor

The saying should be ”On any
given Sunday — except on Super

~ Sunday/’

Once again, Pete Rozelle’s
Game-of—Games proved to be a
resounding flop, as the Giants
pounded Denver 39-20 to win

';. their first Super Bowl title. Hey,

for thirty minutes this one had the
makings of a classic. The score
going into the locker room was
10-9, as John Elway had his un-
derdog Broncos in great position
for an upset.

Then Phil Simms, the quarter-
back that the media forgot, turned
it on. Simms completed all 10 of
his passes —— 22 of 25 for the
game — as his offensive unit out-
scored Denver 30-10 in the sec-
ond half. Ah, another year of
futility for the AFC in '80s Super
Bowls.

And now some final observa-

T tions before retiring the 1986 NFL

season to the record books.

0 The most revealing statistic
from SB XXI is Denver's total
ground yardage in the second
and third quarters — two yards.
John Elway was stunning in the

first two quarters, but the Giants’
defense made adjustments and
quieted him down a bit. The
rushing attack, the meat-and-
potatoes of a Super Bowl cham-
pion, wasn’t on the table for the
Broncos. In the second half, Den-
ver's offense was about as fear-
some as George Bailey. ”What a
horrible life,” Dan Reeves must
have been thinking.

0 Just minutes after the game,
reporters were already plugging

the Giants with questions on 7

’’their chance, of repeating.”
When.will these guys learn that

‘the only dynasty around these

days is a Wednesday night tele-
vision show?

0 The Flops of 1986: Miami Dol-
phins — this team relies solely on
Dan Marino’s arm. Their No Mas
defense finally caught up to them
this season. L.A. Raiders —
without a capable quarterback,
they're worse than the Indy Colts.
Al Davis is really fuming after an
8-8 season. William ”Refrigera-
tor” Perry — the novelty has
worn off.

I0 The Surprises of 1986: Min-
nesota Vikings — Jerry Burns is
forging a team that- should

challenge the Bears for the NFC .

Vreeswyk scored 22 points as

gers 76-56 in an Atlantic 10

It was the Owls" 29th econ.

games this season. They are

Temple 76 Rutgers 56

now 8-0 in the conference,
while Rutgers fell to 3-13 over-
all and 1-8 in the conference.

Rutgers took an 11-5 lead
but Temple went on a 15-2
spurt and a jumper by Nate
Blackwell gave the Owls a
20-13 advantage with nine
minutesleft in the half.

Eric Riggins had 21 points.
