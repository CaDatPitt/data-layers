Athletic Post
is Subject of
Capital Confab

The long-awaited decision re-
garding Pitt’s new athletic direc-
tor may be made today in a Navy
Department oﬁice.

Captain Tom Hamilton is con-
fering with superiors as to'pos-
sibilities of retiring from the Navy
to take the Pitt post.

The Annapolis athletic head vis-
ited Pittsburgh and the Univer-
sity yesterday, departed last night
by train for Washington, and will
return to the Naval Academy fol-
lowing the conferences. He told
newsmen yesterday that, if he re-
turns to Pittsburgh again, it will
be for good.

Although Captain Hamilton de-
clared he was “most interested in
the position and the opportunity
that exists here,” he nevertheless
stated that “I want to do the right
thing by the Navy.”

Questioned by reporters, Cap-

U‘ tain Hamilton admitted that he

was contacted by the athletic com-
mittee as early as June and ﬂew
here in August to discuss the mat-
ter. It was decided then that the
matter would be dropped until the
V completion of the football season.
“After all I had, a.,job to do
there,” he said.
~ _ In reference to his Washington

* .‘1jneeting today, Captain Hamilton

pointed out that the ‘Navy is not
“obligated to give him his retire-
ment. “Retirement is a privilege,
not a right.”

W .The husky Naval officer pos-
_ sesses the 20-year service record

A necessary for retirement, but the
-"Navy has the option of retaining
~v4aluable officers until the maxi-
-mum retirement age of 65 and

,beyond, if the necessity arises.

If he accepts the Pitt offer, he

lﬁcloes ’not expect to come to Pitts-

,burgh immediately. He said he
would wind up considerable busi-
"ness at the Academy before he
brings his family here.

-\ Mrs. Hamilton made the trip
’..With her husband. They met Uni-

iv versity‘ officials and toured the

campus. Captain Hamilton said
that Mrs. «Hamilton accompanied
hlrp primarily to study Pitts-
burgh’s housing situation.

Fred E. Scheline, junior, and
Harry A... Mayhue, sophomore, of
the University have been awarded
Scaife scholarships for outstand-
ing achievement in the ﬁeld of
technical. studies.

Established recently by the
Scaife Company, Oakmont, the
scholarships are awarded annually

either in mechanical or metallur-
gical engineering.

During the summer, scholar-
ship students join the engineering
staif at the Company’s Oakmont
plant, or the Scaife Metalworking
Fellowship at Mellon Institute.

DeSoto Repairs
Near Finish

Desoto Hall, proposed men’s
dormitory, still is not ready for
use, but University ofﬁcials hope
that it will be ﬁnished within the
next few months.

According to William F. Saal-
bach, assistant to the dean of
"men, half of the second and the
entire third floor will be used for
sleeping, recreation and studying.
The other half of the second ﬂoor
and the first floor will probably be
used by some of the ofﬁces in the
Cathedral.

Many renovations are being
made in the former hotel, such as
ﬁxing all the old plumbing, re-
ﬁnishing the plaster work, paint-
ing .the walls, and ﬁnishing the
ﬂoors with asphalt tile.

The ﬁre marshall ordered all
the stairwells changed because
they were too open. All the elec-
trical work has been altered to
conform to present day standards.

Mr. Saalbach did not give any
ﬁigures as to the number of stu-
dents the building will accomo-
date.

McPeak Wins
Most Valuable
Player Award

Bill McPeak,
right‘ end on the

captain and
’48 Panther
squad, was singled out for the
0wl’s trophy as the outstanding
player on the team.

Dr. Homer Butts, vice-presi-

dent of the Varsity Letter-
men’s club, presented the tall,
gold statuette to the four-year

' Pitt terminal at the banquet for

the varsity and freshmen foot-
ballers Wednesday night. Mc-
Peak was selected by his fellow
squad members for the honor.

The Lettermen’s club pur-
chased the trophies for the Owl,
who will award them to out-
standing players in all Univer-'
sity sports.

It was the second straight
year McPeak has been given the
Owl award.

“Bring the family to see your
University” is the invitation ex-
tended to students for the ﬁrst
public open house in Pitt his-
tory. The cathedral block will be
open from 3 to 6 p. m. on Sun-
day afternoon so that guests may
visit the University’s buildings at
their leisure.

Students have an opportunity
to show their family the interest-
ing things they talk about at
home. Hostesses will be nresent in
the Nationality classrooms to ex-
plain their signiﬁcance and arch-
itecture. The early American

classroom, with its second
floor where the pioneer families
hid from the Indians, is an inter-
esting place which many students
have not seen.

Guests will have the rare op-
portunity to go to the top of the
cathedral to take in the panoramic
View of the city.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
and Mrs. Fitzgerald, along with
deans, faculty members and mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees, will
receive the guests in the Com-
mons Room.

Show Off Your School

For the ﬁrst time, the Croghan-
Schenley room will be open for
visiting. This Greek revival style
room from the home of William
Croghan, Jr. is now being restor-
ed in the cathedral. Guests may
also visit the Anna Moody
Browne room on the thirty-third
ﬂoor,which comes from a home
that stood on the cathedral site.

Some of the interest points open
for visitation include the chan-
cellor’s office; libraries and ﬁne
arts department; the biology lab-
oratories; the School of Law; the
Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing; School of Social Work; the
faculty club; the Tuck shops and
many other University facilities.

Stephen C. Foster memorial and
the Heinz Memorial chapel can
be visited. A new bride’s room in
the chapel is to be opened for
visitation. Regular chapel Vesper
services are being conducted at
4 p. m.

The Heinz Chapel choir will
sing at frequent intervals in the
commons room. Light refresh-
ments will beserved.

Spring Reality

If present ideas of the Univer-
sity’s Planning and Development
committee materialize, Pitt will
soon boast of the biggest home for
indoor spectator sports in Pitts-
burgh.

Chancellor Rufus. H. Fitzgerald
revealed Tuesday that plans for
the ﬁeld house, part of the school’s
-$19,450,000 building program, call
for‘ seating facilities for from
10,00-0 to 12,000.

Grading for the new athletic
plant has been completed at the
site on the hill opposite Gates 4,
5, and 6 of the Stadium. C_han-
cellor Fitzgerald, h o W e V e r,
wouldn’t hazard an opinion as to
when the ﬁeld house would be
completed," but said that actual
construction would start ‘in the
spring.

The building is expected to cost
$300,000 and have dimensions of
146 by 304 feet. It will have an
indoor track covering an eighth of
a mile, bigger than the track in
Madison_Square Garden.

Floyd Rose, member ,of the
Board of Trustees, revealed that
the funds for this project have al-
ready been_ raised. Main use of the
building as an indoor sports home
will be for basketball games,

At the Pavilion there are seats
for only 2,600 persons.

Housing of basketball there
marks a switch from original plans
announced earlier this year. First
blueprints designated the gymna-
sium and student center, a 31/4-
million dollar project, as the new
home of these sports. .

The gym will be used for phys-
ical education classes and intra-
murals. Funds for the ‘gymnasium-
student center project will be
raised by bond issue, Mr. Rose
announced.

Congress Sends

Larry Burwinkle and Flora
Diemert, president and secretary,
respectively, of Student Congress,
will meet with student executives
from 20 district colleges today at
Washington and Jefferson College,

Washington, Pa. Problems of stu- I

Surprise

FITTING END

It was only ﬁtting that the news of the man that the Uni-
versity wanted as next athletic director should break prema-
turely. It came as the ﬁnal, climactic sour note in the disson-
ant symphony of publicity rising out of the yearlong athletic
tangle.

Offhand we can’t think of one bit of news dealing with
the various athletic investigating committees or the new eight-
man Athletic Committee that was handled in a competent,
businesslike fashion.

Reports were ﬁlched, committees “leaked,” and releases in
general were fumbled in such a way as to build up a good deal
of ill-feeling with the local press. And the creation of the num-
erous committees, each assigned to do what its predecessor was
supposed to do served to make the University the deserved butt
of journalistic jibes. __ ' I K.

As this is written Capt. Hamilton has not yet accepted the
Athletic Director’s post deﬁnitely. But all indications are that
he will.

One man isn’t going to correct all our difficulties. But the
right man as athletic director could do a lot in restoring the
prestige that the University has lost during the past twelve
months. '

Thus far all the comments about Capt. Hamilton seem to
be favorable. Those who knowhim feel that he is the type of
man Pitt needs as athletic director now.

But just ﬁnding a good man is not enough. In addition
it is necessary that the various factions and cliques in the
alumni and administration keep. their hands off athletics.

Most important of all, the Chancellor should give the new
athletic director the authority and responsibility that goes
with this job and not just the name. “

Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

Yesterday, I ran into Asa

O’Toole, again. Asa is a recent-

graduate of ‘our University and he
is also one of our better contem-
porary novelists. He has written
such notable works as “For Whom
the Bell Tolls,” “Look Homeward,
Angel,” and “Grapes of Wrath.”
Of course Asa knows that three
other guys lay claim to these nov-
els but Asa remains undaufited.
He realizes that the path of genius
is not easy. They, and by they I
mean the authorities, put little
Asa in the clink for his misrepre-
sentation and fraudulent procla-
mations.

While Asa was a guest of the
government he wrote another
book. This time he turned from
ﬁction, and in his latest effort has
produced a text-book. He showed
it to me yesterday and I think
that it shall revolutionize the in-
dustry.

Asa told me that since he didn’t
want his latest achievement to be
confused with abook he had writ-
ten during the ﬂood of ’36 called
“God’s Little Acre,” 1-: was call-
ing his text—book “Theme Writing
Made Easy.” I commented on the
soundness of this plan. He was
glad I liked it and breathed. He
left a copy of his newest book
with me, gave me a stinging slap
on the back, turned away and be-
came lost in the crowd. I could
hardly believe that Asa had gone.
The book, Asa’s book, was all
there was to remind me.

At Home With As-a

Last night, at home and alone
I read Asa’s book. I repeat and I
repeat because I like the phrase, it
shall revolutionize the industry. It
will cause a new era in the Eng-
lish department here at the Uni-
versity. There shall be in this
branch of education a standard-
ization, of marks. If Asa’s text is
used there will be no more A’s,
B’s," C’s, or D’s, there will be only
different gradations of “A” plus
or “A” plusses.

No longer shall the college stu-
dent be up the proverbial estuary
without any visible means of pro-
pulsion, for Asa’s book, “Theme
Writing Made Easy,” shall supply
the paddle for ye olde creek. Por-
ter G. Perrin is ﬁnished and the
patron saint is Asa. Gentle reader,
do not think that I sound the
clarion for a false messiah in our
troubled times.

Asa divides his book into one
part. This he calls love. The sole
aim of the book is to give the stu-
dent a situation which will .keep
said student from beating his head
against the new plaster and sob-
bing, “What will I write about?”
This alone will save the school
money.

Let us look at page 42, just one
of Asa’s many situation pages. Ex-
ample: makinglove in a ﬂat—bot-
tomed boat; not making love in a
ﬂat-bottomed boat; making a ﬂat-
bottomed boat) Oh, the joy of it,

all ready we are handed three'

situations. As Kasper Monahan,
drama critic for the Press has said,
“The possibilities are limitless.”
Winchell burped.

Sifuafion Wifh Adiegfives

Not only does Asa supply the
situation, but the description so
sought after by theme writers is
grouped alphabetically in his glos-
sary of adjectives on page 42.
Take for instance this example of
sixteen adjectives under‘ each of
the following headings. Light
coming over heroine’s left shoul-
der; light coming over hero’s right
shoulder; hero coming over hero-
ine’s right shoulder; heroine com-
ing over hero’s left shoulder; who
shot out the light. Just imagine
16 adjectives and a supplementary
pamphlet of adverbs to describe
each one of the above scenes.

As we turn farther back in the
book to page 42 we ﬁnd that Asa
has included here, along side of
his 312 micro-ﬁlmed war maps for
veteran theme writers, a startling
and novel ideal for the beginning
and ending of themes‘. For the be-
ginning of themes he suggests the
new but simple and homely, “once
upon a time,” while for a beauti-
ful theme ending he suggests the
new but simple and homely, “they
lived hannilv ever after.” '

SAII Americas . . . and. Pitt

By BOB VAN ATTA

  
    
    
  

The travesty of choosing All-America football teams th
year is driven “home” and forcefully illustrated by the tre
ment accorded Pitt ’s Panthers, one of the East’s most successf A
elevens this past season.

Two of Walter (Mike) Milligan’s top-ﬂight linemen, e
Bill McPeak and tackle Nick Bolkovac, are two pawns th
are being moved from one end of the board to the other
myriad selectors of the over-abundance of the mythical
Americas. -

The two best games played by the rebounding Pitt
team came against the two ﬁnal opponents, Purdue and
Penn State.

Many of the so-called “select e1evens” were chosen
prior _to that time. Especially obvious were the Sporting
News and Associated Press All-East lists.

The Sporting News’ choices listed ﬁve Penn State player
end Tamburo, tackle—Norton, guard Simon, and backs Petche
and Rogel. But Pitt didn’t exist in regard to The_ Sportir .
News. V

Who is to say, on the basis of the entire season’s pla
that the ﬁve Nittany Lion players mentioned were all superii
to Bolkovac or McPeak, or both? _ i

AP ’s All-East team noted Pitt performers Bernie Bar-
kouskie, Bimbo Gecconi, and McPeak among their honor-
mentions, then on their subsequently selected All-State
picks moved Bolkovac ahead of many others who were
recognized on the All-East which failed to show Nick.

The day after the NEA Newspaper feature syndicate nam]
Nick Bolkovac to their All-America second team, the Pit '
burgh Quarterback Club’voted McPeak as the city ’s most val
able collegiate lineman. '

Confusing, isn’t it?

It still stands that too many cooks spoil the broth, an
more so when it’s taken off the stove too soon.

Chancellor's P's and Q's

By MYRON KOPELMAN A

I had a ﬁreside chat with the Chancellor last week, and
am now prepared to say things that may endanger Chancell
Rufus H. Fitzgerald ’s standing as a host in society’s blue boo

The English teachers had an-¢
nounced to ‘their classes that the
Chancellor was setting aside a
day on which sophomores, might
visit his office for a chat and per-
hapsa cup of tea. Now this sound-
ed real nice so I attended. And‘
though I found the reception a
rather pleasant one, I came away,
nevertheless, with the notion that
both chancellors and students still
have a bit to learn about these
affairs.

In the ﬁrst place,,the sopho-
more is not quite sure how t9 go
about getting chaty with a chan-
cellor. Does one breeze up to the

Chancellor, slap him on thefba
and‘say,,“Hi, Chance, how the h
are educational trends the
days?” Or does one use a m‘ i

 
    
  
  
   
   
  

man over with a lot of sirs?"

As host, it is up to ‘the Cha
cellor to put the sophomore
ease by striking up a friendly «co
versation. Fitzgerald, who see
like a regular guy who.must ha
shot a fair game of pool in up
day, proved an excellent host fr
the conversational standpoint.’

I know not what course others
may take, but I personally prefer
to dunk my cookies in milk. As a
compromise, however, I would
suggest that the Chancellor serve
coffee and doughnuts at his next
reception. This combination is
good for both the digestion and
the conversation.
Of course, the students, too, can

There is no point in singing

Summer With‘ Inclians
Tough But Enjoyable

By BERNICE RIVLIN
Mary Batz will not sacriﬁce her vacation to help the Indians,

yut she has no regrets for having

spent her summer vacation on an

ndian reservation. Mary worked for the Friends Association build-
1g quonset huts on a Navajo reservation this past July and August.

Mary enjoyed her work on the reservation located at the south-
astern tip of Utah. “Try it sometime,” Mary said, as she tried to
txplain what type of work she did and the conditions which she

nd her twenty—three co-workers

encountered.

“Try it,” she said, and added°
uickly, “Conditions are terrible.
he schools are 100 miles apart
‘Id the hospitals for the Navajas
/en more scattered. The unsani-
.ry living conditions cause the
zath of 50% of the babies and
any adults.”

To this Mary recalled that one
3 the twelve men and women stu-
ants, who represented colleges
om many states, contracted scar-
t fever and had to be taken 150
iles to the nearest hospital. “If
.e person who got the scarlet
ver had been anyone but a stu-
ant he wouldn’t have been ad-
itted,” Mary said.

Students have a trgditional idea
.at Indians are war-whooping,
iisterous people; actually, the
idians considered the students
'ery noisy.” The Indians are a
ary colorful people, though. At
ght they gathered around a
mpfire on the desert, and held
eir Sings. Terminating in a

Squaw Dance the students thought
the Sing was over . . . the Dance
continued for three nights.

Scorpions, ﬂies, and rattlesnakes

were as common there as ants are"

in Pennsylvania. On a cooler sum-
mer day the thermometer soared
t. a low 103 degrees.

When the students were not do-
ing manual labor, Mary says, they
took time off to visit the ancient
ruins; they found a few valuable
relics of now—defunct Indian cul-
ture. They visited trading posts
where, student-like, they spent
their summer allowances for
jewelry. This was volunteer work
that they were doing.

In remembrance of a summer
vacation, the “likes of which”
could not be spent in the East,
those glimpses of the desert as a
“modified Grand Canyon” are
paramount. “The buttes rise out
of nowhere,” Mary said, and she
hurried off to a YWCA meeting.

[College to Continue
Its Marriage Course

The marriage course known as Orientation 102, which has been
given in the spring semester for ten years, will be offered again in
the spring semester, Stanton Crawford, dean of the College, announced

today.

The course will be offered on a

of on a two—credit basis as pre-

students will be able to add a one-
credit course to their schedules
than was possible when the course

reduction in hours, it will also be

Quints Take Over at Stadium;

Locals Drop IM Title
Came to Tech, 19-13

Tech’s TNT’s lit the fuse, but Pitt’s Locals had no Wicks to touch
off as the Tartan IM grid champions defeated the Locals, 19-13, on
slippery Stadium turf Wednesday. Bob Wicks, who all year led his
team in both offense and defense, was sidelined by a pulled ligament.

 

Tasso Katselas stole the show for Tech as he helped his team
to the ﬁrst Plaid IM victory over a Pitt team in three years.
The Locals were continually outcharged, outfaked, and out-

Sponsored by the IM Depart-

play a demonstration game.

Although the clinic is design-

¢blocked by Tech. It wasn’t until
late in the game that the Locals
looked like their past performance
indications.

. Katselas Stars

Katselas’ first bit of ﬁreworks
came in the ﬁrst quarter. He faked
the Local line, darted past the
line of scrimmage, and ﬂipped a
lateral to Pete Katsfanas who went
all the way. The play covered 60
yards.

The Locals roared right back
when Tom Carr took the kick-off
on his own goal line and sprinted
80 yards to tie up the game. When
Jocko Ruth snagged the extra-
point pass, the Pitt champs were
ahead for the ﬁrst and last time.

In the second period Marty
Chetlin slipped behind the loose
Local defense, and_ took a Kat-
selas pass for the second score.
Again the TNTs missed the extra
point and the half ended at 12-7.

Penalties Costly

Three unnecessary roughness
penalties against the Locals set up
the ﬁnal TNT score. The penal-
ties set the ball on the two, from
where Katselas easily trotted over.

For awhile, it looked as if the
Locals might rally. Fred Valicenti
tossed a pass to Tom Laboon to
make the score 19-13. After hold-
ing desperately on their one-yard
line, the Locals moved upﬁeld to
the Tech 10, only to be foiled by
the ﬁnal whistle.

‘Meet Saturday
In City Opener

By BOB VAN ATTA

Pittsburgh collegiate basket-

tomorrow night at the Stadium

Dr. II. Clifford Carlson’s peren-
nial optimists.

The rivals take the court for an
8:15 p. m. tipoﬂz‘ following a pre-
liminary attraction starting one
hour earlier.

Prospects are expected to fol-
low the pattern set up by the Pan-
thers’ two victories last winter,
35-34 and 42-34. Nittany Lion
games in the past have tradition-
ally recorded low scores because
of a tight State zone defense
which slows play. 3

Pitt Slight Favorite

Both squads feature holdovers
in key spots with the home team
a slight favorite. The edge in
height, as usual, goes to the oppo-
sition. '

Practice games at State College
have shown Martin Costa (6-6) as
an excellent rebound man, while
Willard Parkhill (6-4) has been
hitting regularly on his set shots.

Cecconii, Geremsky’  
iFinding State Teams

Frequent Company
By MYRON KOPELMAN I
Ted Gereinsky and‘ Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi cannot be blamed

ry and hullabaloo.

ii if they get just a little bored with all this Pitt—Penn State rival-

_ Less than two weeks ago the two athletes ﬁnished their
V football season against Penn State, and now they are asked to
start their basketball season against the Lions.

So if Pitt wins

the basketball fray, it will be two in a row over State for

Geremsky and Oecconi.
Becauseof the football season,

I ’ the pair of gridders started basket-

ball practice more than a month
late. Yet, according to Coach H.

—C; Carlson, Cecconi, in his ﬁrst

practice session," looked like he

I D had been drilling for weeks.

For the past two_ seasons Bim-
bo has been ﬁve feet, seven inches
worth of peppery dribbling and
running. Though he has not been
first string college material, he has
proved an entertaining spot play-

er.

Geremsky, a six foot, three inch
gridiron end who plays center in
basketball, has an unusual athlet-
ic background.

The tall Braddock boy was not
brought to Pitt by athletic talent
scouts. In fact’Dr. Carlson’s only
previous knowledge of him was
acquired when the medic extract-
ed the tonsils of Geremsky’s
father.

You‘see, tall Teddy never played
any typeof ball in high school.
While in Japan with the armed
forces, hogever, he began to take
an interest in atheletics.

Possessing an adequate body
for either basketball or football,
he rapidly developed into college
material. He still has a lot to learn,
nevertheless. Ted has yet to com-
pletely overcome his gangling
awkwardness, but he is improving.

Last year Geremsky joined the
team in mid-season, for it was
not until then that he became an
eligible sophomore. Dr. Carlson
used him sparingly as a relief
man for regular center Mort Ler-
ner.

More than likely, Ted will play
the same role this season.

With the close of football season, All-American teams are certain
to be chosen. Therefore, since Pitt’s intramural football ended_‘Wed-
nesday, News reporters, ably assisted by IM referees and Leo C.

-Bemis, director of IM activities, selected an All-Campus team.

Represented on this All-Star ﬁrst team are three fraternity men,
two Independents, and a Professional league player.

Bob Wicks, ace backﬁeld. star of the champion Locals, was the
only unanimous choice of the¢
grid experts. _ .

Local Star Chosen

Wicks, the crack triple threat
man of the undefeated titlists,
sparked his team with his excel-
lent running and passing to their
second consecutive independent
championship. The Locals then
went on to defeat the Phi Garns
for the IM crown.

Rated as the fastest man in
IM circles, Kent I Thorpe, Delta
Tau Delta scatback, was instru-
mental in leading the Delts to the
Section II title of the Interfrater-
nity League.

Rounding out the backﬁeld on
this mythical six, Joe Stewart,
tailback of Psi Omega, Profession-
al League winners, led the Dents
to the semi-ﬁnals in IM competi- I

tion. The tall boy was a sharp . .
passer and a stalwart on defense. Special Lunches

To make sure it can, we test samples of each day’s pro-
duction and put telephones through the equivalent of years
of_.service in a few hours or days. For example: we drop
handsets into their cradles 22,000 times—-equal to 4 years’
normal use. And not just once, but from 16 diﬂerent posi-
tions, we drop sample telephones from desk-top height
onto ii hardwood surface. We even check their feet to be
certain they won’! scratch your table.

‘Players Ready Foster Memorial
For Experimen’rWith ‘The Flies’

helpers have already set up some
scenery on Foster stage.

The scenery, like the Play ii‘
self, is something of an experi-
ment for the Players. It is de-
signed so that it will be ﬂexible
enough to change easily for the
various scenes. Portions of it will
revolve to facilitate handling.

At the same time members of
the costume crew have spent the
last few weeks dying, cutting,
sewing and ﬁtting the Greek-style
costumes. ,

“The Flies,” based on the Greek
legend of Electra, opens next
Thursday. Sartre, its author, is
equally famous as a philosopher
and playwright.

He is one of the leading expo-
nents of the new philosophy of
Existentialism now popular in
Western Europe.

Several of his plays have been
produced on Broadway in recent
years. Most famous are ,“No Exit”
and “The Respectable Prostitute.”

Two colleges, Chicago Univer-
sity and Vassar College, have
staged “The Flies” previously. At
Chicago it was acclaimed as the
outstanding production of the uni-
versity’s dramatic season.

Plans for Year

The Graduate Cap and Gown
Society took another step towards
“slow death” at a general meet-
ing here last Monday.

After a thorough and pessimis-
tic discussion of the lack of stu-
dent interest in the club, the mem-
bers decided to “hibernate” for the
winter. Plans for their annual
production of an all-male variety
show as well as for minor activi-
ties were all deﬁnitely pigeon-
holed for this school year.

The organization itself will con-
tinue to function passively but

duction will not be considered un-
til next winter.
