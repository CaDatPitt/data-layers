Death Of President On Friday

Plummets School Into Sorrow

When John F. Kennedy rode smiling to his appointment with an assassin on the; streets of Dallas
last Friday, the University was in a‘ festive mood preparing for Saturday’s football contest with arch-
rival Penn'State. Girls from Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority were busy in the main lobby of the
Towers grabbing‘ every player that came their way -to have him sign the victory poster which they had
taped to the dorm’s glass wall‘. -

Out in~the“quad, a few hardy Tri—Delts had scampered atop the arch-way between McCormick ’
'and._'Bruce Halls and were securing a long banner in place informing students of the group’s faith that

the Panthers would trounce the Lions soundly on the morrow. Students in the cafeteria were hurriedly
ﬁnishing off their lunch so they could be on time for those few last classes before the weekend began.

All conversation centered on the prospects of a 9-1 record for the ‘team and a New Year’s Day spent

at the Orange Bowl in Miami. I,’ .
With little concern .for the classes ahead,’ students trudged wearily to the Cathedral or up the
hill to Engineering Hall. In Clapp Hall, Chemistry II students were sitting in lab preparing for their
weekly quiz or ‘frantically ﬁnishing therr neglected or merely misunderstood experiment reports.
_ Home For Thanksgiving ‘
In the University Travel Service office on Forbes Avenue, a few people were signing checks se-
curing their plane seats home for the Thanksgiving vacation. ‘
‘With the big game coming up, however, many had decided not to attend class at all and were
just milling abouttalking and joking over nothing in particular. . L
«In many rooms of the dorms,- students sat idly by listening to the top 40 on KQV—or to the Midday
Masterpieces of WRYT.‘ They were the ﬁrst to learn. , _ A ' n _ . ' _ ._
The ‘news came in shortly before 2 p.m. EST. President Kennedy while on hlS way to deliver
an address beforeithe city fathers of Dallas had been shot by a sniper. Students looked_ up in horror at
their radios, scarcely believing what theyhad heard. “Oh my God,” one student -exclaimed dropping
his notebook and scattering papers ‘across the floor of his room and out into the hall.
I . Reaction Was Immediate
The reaction was the same everywhere. Studentsiand faculty alike in every University building
from the Field House to .the Cathedral turned with rapt attention to the radios to which they had been
only half listening, a moment before. I = _
The news spread with terrible rapidity. Within minutes, large crowds had gathered in front
every radio and television available. They were silent and not a. few were crying. _
In Clapp Hall, one student whose mind was not completely’ engrossed with the quiz laying in
front of him on his desk, heard a radio invthe office next door- give the announcement. As soon as the

papers were collected he jumped up and hurried-out Of the room

shouting “The President’s been shot!” He was followed by half the

of

class. .

By this time, the facts were piling up. The President had been
hit in the head by a bullet’ ﬁred from a building along the route of
travel and was in serious condition at a nearby_ Texas hospital. Then,
at approximately 2:20 p.m., the announcer over WRYT choked up for-
a second and then revealed quietly that John F. Kennedy had died
of his wounds at two o’clock, and that Lyndon" Johnson was now
President of the United States.

_ In the Pharmacy School, a test’ was just being concluded when

a girl rushed in crying. “He's dead! He's dead!” she said’. and then
ran down the hall. ‘

Chancellor Litchﬁeld was reported to have wept when he was
informed of the President’s death. '

In Mellon Bank on Fifth Avenue, a ﬂoor councelor from Tower
A turned away from cashing a check to watch a couple of nuns lead-
ing a group of silent children into St. Paul’s Cathedral to pray for
the soul of the slain chief executive. I t '

Back in the Cathedral, classes wereeither called or dismissed
immediately upon convening. One professor walked into a silent
classroom, looked around solemnly for a minute, and said in a barely
audible x7oice, “Go home.” He then turned and‘wa'lked out with face
in his hands. - ..

By now,'the man with a portable‘ radio was the center of at-
traction, and there were many. A crowd of about a hundred blank
faced students had gathered under the clock on the ground ﬂoor.
of the Cathedral listening to thereports coming out of one student’s
tink transistor. _

In the Student Union, WPGH was‘ being kept busy posting the
latest news off the teletype on a board in the main lobby. One stu-
dent rushed angrily into an 'oﬂ”1ce in the Union when he thought he
heard someone playing a Vaughn Meader album, only to discover
that it was a radio giving a rebroadcast of the speech the-President
had made earlier in the day at Fort Worth. '

The shock of the assassination had not yet worn off before stu-
dents were beginning to raise questions on the tragic event. The re-
ports from Dallas were still scanty and incomplete. Who was Lee

milled around silently waiting for the first edition of The Pittsburgh
Press to hit the newsstand. When the papers ﬁnally did arrive the
the headline on the front page was larger than most students ‘had
ever seen. “Only when Japan surrendered was it any “bigger,” one
faculty member remarked. But the papers disappeared almost at
once, and students hurried down Forbes Avenue to Gus Miller’s
only to ﬁnd that he too was sold out. And for once, the news boys
around the dorms were nowhere to be found. 7

, male student. “Here,” she said, “take one. I’ve got enough for every-

body.” '

Back in the Union, shocked students stood around in small groups,
and those who were not weeping openly were trying desperately to
hold back the emotion built up inside, I ' ,

From student offices in the building, other groups stared blankly
out their windows at the American flag waving sposmadically at half
mast in front of_Carnegie Institute. '

V A rumor that Lyndon Johnson had suffered a heart attack
_spread through the Towers but was quickly squelched by new re-.
portsicoming in every few minutes over the radio.

One girl, her face red from. crying, sat in the Towers lobby re-
peating over and over to herself: “I have to remember the date, I have
to remember the date.” - .

Those that had been here when Kennedy appeared in Pittsburgh
during his 1960 presidential campaign and those that had seen him up
at‘ the Field Housenlast year sat around discussing his youth and en-

thusiasm. “He was ‘OUR’ President,” one remarked, “he understood’ ‘

‘OUR’ problems.” ~

_As' dinner time approached, girls who had been too emotionally
upset earlier to think clearly, tried to get in touch with their datesvfor
the evening to tell them they didn’t feel like going anywhere. Most
of the men on campus felt the same way, but some tried to hide from
the day's trgaic event by going to a local bar and drinking.

In the cafeteria there was no grumbling in line about the service
nor caustic comments’ over the food. The tables were alive with con-
versation but it was hushed and respectful. Students with fresher
information were greeted with questions and puzzled glances from
other "tables. ‘ , V . "

. Later in the evening, students still stood around the Towers’
lobby not quite knowing what to do nor where to turn. “It’s hard
to believe,” was still on many lips though the president had been
dead for ﬁve long hours. “I can’t understand,” one student remarked
shaking his head, “the time has gone by like it was a hundred years --
not just a few hours.” Many felt the same way. ‘ ‘ ‘

It was ﬁnally announced that the game had been postponed for

two weeks. There was almost unanimous relief at this bit of news.
“I ‘don’t see how they could have expected anyone to cheer tomor-
row,” someone said, “It just wouldn?t have been right.”

The initial shock had now passed for most and they wanted to
know all the facts. Radios which had been turned off earlier because
students couldn’t stand to hear any more once again told of the
situation in Dallas, in Washington, and throughout the world. The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was now out and students again rushed to
the newsstands for their copies. “I want to keep this paper for ever,"
was a common comment.

Far into the night, students huddled together in dorm rooms

and offices to discuss the death of the President. One student ﬁnally .
called it quits: “I’m going to bed and try and sleep away this day-—

Shriver Lectured To Recruit  

Spurs Enthusiasm
For Peace Corps

By NANCY DELANEY

“Successful” a d e q u a t e-
ly describes Sargent Shriver’s
Midday Series lecture on
Tuesday.

Shriver, as director of the
Peace Corps, was here to re-
cruit, and that’s exactly what he
did.

The amount of information he
conveyed would hardly have ﬁll-
ed the front side of an illustrated
leaflet; but he was not here to
inform. He was here, according to
the coordinator of the Pittsburgh
recruiting team, George Nicolav to
tell potential volunteers “about
the critical need for their skills
in developing nations around the
world.”

The enthusiasm he generated
for the program probably surpass-
ed even that aroused by a military
parade and strains of “It’s a
Grand Old Flag.”

Did Not Flag Wave

Yet he did not flag-wave. He
admitted that the Corps certainly
would not produce “instant
peace.” “But,” he indicated, “we
have done what we set out to do
-- and that’s unusual.” The Peace
Corps, in, response to invitations

'' from foreign countries, has sent

capable young Americans to-live
and work with the people and
under the cultural conditions of
the various countries.

These volunteers have re-

SARGEANT SHRIVER
Promotes‘ Peace Corps

presented what America stands
for. They are chosen on the
basis of merit alone, and they
care quite competent. Not one
country has asked to have a
volunteer recalled for in-
"competency or misbehavior.
There has not been one fracas.
“And you’d normally expect
4000 22 or 23-year-old men to
get in at least one 'barroom
brawl in two and a half years!”

-volunteers

,Director’s Talk.
Rated A Success

The volunteers are popular and
respected because they are quali-

ﬁed and they have worked hard, _

ﬁlling necessary jobs as teachers,
lawyers, architects, social work-

, ers, and agrculturalists. Not‘ long
~ ago, Shriver went to Manilla to

receive Asian equivalent of the
Nobel Prize for the great" con-

’ tribution the Peace Corps has

made .to.Asia.
Too Few Volunteers

If the Corps —were not popular,
there would, not be so much de-
mand for more volunteers. The
Peace Corps ow has 7,000 Volun-
teers in 46 co nties, and countries

vhave vdoubled and tripled the

number of invitations for more
help, butthere just are not enough
volunteers to ﬁll the demand.
Working in the Peace Corps
is according to the president of

Harvard, “a better education
than a Rhodes Scholarship.” In

addition, the Peace Corps opens
avenues into government and
business, which are eager to
hire Peace Corps veterans. This,
however, is not the really im-
portant motivation. Most of all,
“you must desire to help peo-
ple,” Shriver indicated.

The entire Peace‘ Corps pro-
gram was summed up by Shriver
in the words of one of the ﬁrst
to die -doing peace
Corps work: “Should it come to
it, I would rather give my life
trying to help someone than have

‘to give it looking down a gun

barrel at him.”

‘The Coachmen ’Brin

Rousing Enthusiasm A

B)’ BETSY EDISON

In the current barrage of folk-singers, “The Coach-
men” are newcomers with a deﬁnite personality.

“You might call it ‘rousing enthusiasm,’ ” suggested
Jeff Frand, youngest member of the group. “We feel it’s
the personality of_ the group that sells the song because
it’s one thing to sing, but another thing to put the song
across to your audience. We sing the way we feel, and sinc.e we
all" three enjoy singing, enthusiasm naturally comes across.”

Making their University debut aboard the Clipper ship during
the summer orientation program, “The Coachmen” have perform-

 

ed for various organizations around the city, at country clubs,‘

and on two television shows, To the accompaniment of two guitars,
a banjo, and sometimes bongos, Frand, Lee -Kalik, and Dennis
Prince sing their collection of folksongs and s_pirituals.
“Usually we try to sing the songs that most people are
familiar with and the songs that we ourselves like. People
seem to like to hear songs they can recognize and even sing
along with. . *
A “Currentsongs are always in demand because they catch
people’s imagination, or their ear. The openingof one of our

shows will usually be ‘Three Jolly Coachmen,’ followed by songs’

like ‘Cotton Fields,’ ‘Kisses Sweeter Than Wine,’ or maybe ‘Two
Brothers.’ But the songs we choose ‘vary -with the type of audience.

The origin of the group was “spontaneous,” according to
Kalik, and dates back to last September on Fifth Avenue. “J eﬂf
and I were going over to the dorms. to visit some friends ‘one
night, and I brought Denny along.

“I parked the car near the‘ “Y” and the three of us were
walking to Holland Hall. Denny had his uke with him and
we just started singing; I guess -it was because Jeff and I had
sung together in a vocal ensemble "in high school. That was
the ﬁrst time “The Coachmen”, sang as a group and we’ve“
been at it ever since.” -

Although "singing in the traditional manner of folk-singers,

“The Coachmen” have added a few innovations of their own. To
close three—part harmony and stringed accompaniment, they blend

' in abrisk pace for each number, resulting in a compulsion for

toe-tapping on the part of the ‘audience. »
The lively beat pulses through rollicking songs such as “The
Drunken Sailor” as well as slow ballads such as “Two Brothers.”

K

“We ha.ve no basic lead singer,” noted Frand, “but we do V

have sets where each of us gets the lead at one time or another.
Everyone plays a part in the group. Although one of the trends
in folk-singing is ﬁll-in material through jokes and the like, we

, feel that people come to hear singing and that’s what we pre-

dominately do. Thereiis aneed, though, for somefill-in material.
_ , “Over the summer,” continued Frand, “we got involved
with World Artists’ Records, Inc. After we had sung for the
representative of the co_mpany he informed us to come back
in a "week with songs we had written.
“We hadn’t written any yet, sowe got together and com-
posed. We came outwith a song.called ‘Going Home Now,” -and
another called ‘Flowers.’ These two songs were recorded and‘

fwere released the week of September 22. The side with ‘Going

Home_ Now’ is the one being pushed. There’s’ a special agent
for this from the recording company. 0 .
As for the future, there are still college years ahead for “Th

/Coachmen.” Frand, a freshman in pre-med; Kalik, a sophomore A

and Price, currently "working, will, according to Frand, “just
drift along together; At least for the next two years.

“We’ll see how things work out, and meanwhile we’re under
contract with World Artists. So we’ll cut some more records in
the future and -just wait and see.” ’ '

Interfraternity Council is doing a truly commendable job thislyear, and proved
once and for all at last Wednesday’s meeting that it is more concerned with academic
than with social standards of achievement. At that time, the IFC passed a motion by

Norman Himes forbidding thelconstruction of Homecoming ﬂoats by fraternities,‘
because they take up entirely too much time for the scholastic well-being of ' the

brothers. - I - -

It was explained at ‘the meeting that some fraternity members had spent up to
25 times as many hours working on ﬂoat construction as did their brothers, and that
most groups exceeded the amount which they were permitted to spend on the build-
u I . 1;
mg. , , - _
Although at least one fraternity was in favor of retaining the ﬂoat program next

. year, most rated grades and money above other considerations. ’ .

The motion, however, contains a loophole which ‘would permit the Council to
consider its decision if “The Homecoming Committee can draw up a proposal which

’will eliminate the present manifest disadvantages.” Such a proposal -would have to

be approved by IFC before the ban would be lifted.

However, when Norm Himes announced IFC’s decision at last Thursday’s Stu-
dent Government- meeting, the matter was passed over quickly I-with a comment by
Vice-President Gussie Smith that the time allotted to float construction might be cut
from three to one week. _ _ H A A I - , A

Perhaps SG does not appreciate the importance of IFC’s decision else Miss Smith
would not have dismissed the announcemet so rapid_ly_. Homecoming is"one of SG’s
most commercial and respected endeavors, and one would imagine that any decision
by IFC which might dull up the presentation atriflewould instantly set SC: all a
tither. ' . ’

Two years ago whendecorated house fronts -were substituted for movable
ﬂoats, Homecoming was a rather colorless affair to the great percentage of University

- students. Does not SG realize that no ﬂoats at all would go far toward killing Home-

coming completely? The Greeks supply a large portion of the Homecoming spirit and

to lose the ﬂoats would be to lose much of this spirit. ' ‘ "
IFC’s motives for discontinuing ﬂoat building are strictly honorable, and the

motion passed last week does present SG;with the opportunity to do some hard work

and still save this integral part of the Homecoming program. However, unless SG-
starts taking IFC a little more seriously, there aren’t going to be any ﬂoats next year .

  

and possibly, in a few ye'ars there isn’t going to be any, Homecoming.

I’ve been working on the
Hill Education Project for the
last seven weeks. Slowly but
surely the way I see the world

' has changed.

I believed that our school
system was inadequate. But
this 'view was shaped from
reading what other people,
whose political sentiments co-

‘ incided with mine, had writ-

ten. The many bad teachers,
as contrasted to the few good-

. teachers, I had in high school

also "influenced ‘my thinking.
One of my interests, there-
fore in the Hill Education Proj-
ect was the effect it" would
have on those students who tu-
tored. Naturally, I was inter-
ested in the beneﬁts the pro-

gram offered to those high‘

school students who need help.
This is why I tutor. Yet my
hope was that those students
who tutored would, because of
that experience come to the
conclusion that our school sys-
tem needed improvement.

I learned I had no idea of
how‘ bad things
What could I know about‘ the
inadequacy of education when
I went to Taylor Allderdice,
where 80% of the students go
on to college. Now, in order

to‘ get an idea of how bad.

things are I take the two

really are. '

    

I 1

worst teachers l’ve ever had

and multiply them num‘erous_

times. They represent the ‘av-
erage teacher in a poor neigh-
borhood. ,
One of the most common
problems I’ve encountered is
that these high school stu-
dents don’t know how to read.
One girl is tutoring a _boy,,in
7th grade who is failing three

' subjects because he can’t read.

How did he ever get into the

seventh grade if he can’t read? ’

Why didn’t someone find out
sooner"? Chances are if he had
gone to grade school in a mid,-
dle or upper class neighbor-
hood one of his teachers would

have known he needed special,

help. In fact I know of such a
case. But this boy had the
misfortune of being born in a
slum. Either his teachers didn’t
know or care if he couldn’t
read. ’
This boy who can’t under-
stand-anything he reads is an
extreme case, though I be-
lieve there are many others
like him. Another tutor il-
lustrates the more common
case. She reads a paragraph
and was unable to coherently
explain what she read. She had
never been ‘forced to concep-
tionalize. Her head was stuffed
with vague meaningless facts.

She couldn’t even remember

who we fought in the Ameri- .

can Revolution, though she /re-
called that the, minutemen
fought the British on Bunker
Hill.

And. this girl. isn’t stupid.

She knows how to do the least
amount of work and still pass
with a C or D.

But nothing sticks’ because
it is meaningless. And she is
not wholly unmotivated. Every
high school student. who signs
up with HEP asking for help
is motivated. HEP therefore
encounters only, the more mo-
tivated students. Yet, we just
begin to scratch the surface
‘of the problem. We don’t meet

the drop-outs who need even 4

more help than those we are
helping. This summer Presi-
dent Kennedy had organized
a movement to persuade po-
tential drop outs to come back
to school to graduate. Of those
that were persuaded, about
250,000 I think, 90% have since
dropped out again. The reason
is quite clear.‘ These kids need
special help which the schools
aren’t equipped" to give them.
And the problem is getting
worse.

I would be satisﬁed to see
all grade schools, high schools,

and vocational schools , raised .

to the level of a Taylor Allder-
dice. That’s a hell of a long
ways from Utopia, but it would
be a fantastic, improvement
over what we have now. Yet
I doubt that this will happen.
“ Not because we couldn’t do it,
and more, but because we
don’t want to do it. We don’t
want to know it needs to be
done. My only hope is that au-

tomation will force us to revo- '
lutionize. our ‘thinking about
’ education because an auto-

Trading and mayhem reached a peak'last week, and the
only thing missing inthe Towers Lobby exchange’ center
was the ticker tape. Runnersand messengers, however, kep
the buyers aware of the current happenings  .
and ﬁuctuations in sales while the “brok—
ers’.’ tried desparately tounload their bonds
before the_close of trading.- ,_ A -

Stein’s business index showedan aver
age. gain of zeroand an average loss "of zero,
but, some few people made money, and if
some made, some .had to lose. ,

Exactly when the bond chain began is

tastic proportions until the crowd of buy- s
ers and sellers inthe Tower A lobby looked like a convention
of tobacco auctioneers. '

*1

\.

 

How the chain works is a little confusin'g,.but,as simply =

as possible: Mr. Apurchases a $25 U.S. Savings Bond from
Mr. B for $37.50. Thebond is made out to ,a Mr.'C..Wit_h the
bond, Mr. A also buys a list of ﬁve names. Mr. C’s name
is "at the top of the list. Mr. ‘A. sends the bond to Mr. C and
crosses Mr. C’s name off the list and adds his own name to
the bottom. Mr. A then goes to the bank and ‘purchases two
more $25 bonds from the bank at $18.75 each and makes each
out to. Dr. _D, who is now ﬁrst on the list after Mr. C.>Mr. A
now must sell each of "the two  D bonds to a buyer with

$75‘dollars after purchasing the three bonds, is now even.
All he need do it wait until the chain repeats itself four
more times and he will receive 32 bonds made out in his
name. If he cashes the bonds right away, he has made an im-
mediate proﬁt of $599. If he waits ten years until the bonds
mature he will have‘ made $800. A

Things seemed” to be going swimrningly until last Thurs-

day. The exchange was buzzing, and buyers were planning"

their moves and setting up their buyers well in advance. Most,
in fact, became sellers‘ long before they ever’ saw the bonds
they had purchased. But then the Federal Reserve stepped
in. The word went out to the Pittsburgh National Bank -
no more bonds were to besold in any name other than the
name of the purchaser.

That means the chain should come to an end — on the
University campus, at least. The trend is, however, that once
the chain dies on one campus, those stuck with’ the bonds
look for new territory at another school. But there will al-
ways-be the few who will not be able to ﬁnd another market
for the bonds and the many at the bottom of the .lists who
will be stuck with three $25 bonds which they bought for
$75, made out to someone else, which nobody is willing
to buy. - ‘

Those at the top of- the list make the money. They are
the people who started the chain, and their series repeated
itself more than enough times -in the height of the activity.
At this moment I know of only three people out of the many
buyers whose bonds sold and resold enough times to return

a proﬁt. Onesof these people. has received as many as 12 bonds  ..
fortunately most of the others ‘willihever see .a_ ‘_7'§

Memo to all individuals who enjoy movie musicals
and popular music: If you want to see some of the best
musicals ever to come out of the Hollywood factories,
hop the nearest streetcar and journey to one of the local

' theatres Where an M-G-M are-release is being shown.
These ﬁlms will 'only be shown on Wednesdays so a care-
ful budgeting of time is necessary in "order for you to
obtain a motion picture treat. ’

I’m not sure which theaters are presenting the ﬁlms’ but a

~/copy of the 'Post-Gazette or the Press will remedy that situation.

What I am sure of,‘ however, is the six ﬁlms that are making the

rounds and that each one represents a highly enjoyable and enter-

taining piece of ﬁlmusic‘alia. I- L
RE-RELEASES

The ﬁlms/are, in chronological order, “Words and Music,”
“ ’Til the Clouds R011 By,” “Three Little Words,”.“Singin’ in -the.

Rain,” “The Bandwagon,” and “Because You’re Mine.” All are

from the M-G-M stable and have been re-released to a new
/ generation of ﬁlm» goers. I am very delighted to see this hasbeen
’ done because of the scarcity of movie musicals in recent years, If

it weren’t for the contributions from the Broadway, stages the

number of musicals to appear in movie houses recently would be
. exactly zero: savefor those Elvis Presley extravaganzas.

The service’ done by the moguls at M-G-M is an invalu-
able_ one. Of course, one mus'n’t' overlook the fact that the
making of money is the prime motivation forthe re‘-release of
these ﬁlms. But Bob O’Brien, the current president of M-G-M,
also made it very explicit, in a recent Variety article, that he
is trying to bring some great popular music’ back into the
hearts of the public and is likewise trying to -present to a,
new’ generation the products of an original Hollywood form-—
that of the movie musical. «

Whether you want to believe Mr. O’Brien is not of my

concern,7but what is of my concern is the constant question from

people’ aroundthe country who ask, “Whatever happened to those
great old musicals and why doesn’t Hollywood‘ make any more
like them?”' ' .
That question can really only be answered by the men’ in
charge of making those musicals and my guesses . would only
. clutter up the actualreaso'ns.'An.yway, Mr. O’Brien is doing his
best to revive some of the ﬁlms that combined the best in music,

' comedy, color, and every other devicethat spells out escapism.

. . / OLD FAVORITES 

If you see “Words and Music” or “ ’Til the Clouds Roll By,”
you. will see the. songs’ of Rodgers and Hart and Jerome Kern
performed by the likes of Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Lena
Horn, Perry Como, June Allyson, and many more. These ﬁlms
are supposed to be the life stories of the tunesmiths mentioned,
but the plots are to be taken with a grain of sodium chloride and

-“you can sit’ back and watch and listen as “My Funny Valentine,”

.... I
4.’ .-—

“Where or When,” “Lover,” and “Old Man River,” come sweep-
ing across the screen in glorious sound and color.

‘_‘Three Little . Words” is also the story of ‘songwriters’ '
but Red Skelton is around to make even the plot entertaining
as well as the many old songs of the 20's and 30’s,.

I could write reams about “Singin’ in the Rain,” since I con-
sider it to be the best musical satire of Hollywood that has come
out of that magicland. It is a satire of the musicals of the 1920’s,

Gene Kelly and Donald O’Conner perform beautifully in every A

way. This was also one of the earliest appearances of Debbie
Reynolds and after you see it, you will know why she became
an instant sensation and became America’s darling. Gene Kelly
also co-directed along with Stanley Donen, and the dancer’s
unquestioned genius in the ﬁeld of choreography is apparent
throughout this totally delightful and original musical.
. FINEST MUSICALS”

The final two ﬁlms in the series offer two of the ﬁnest musi-
cal talentslin‘ screen history a chance to show, off their amazing
gifts. “The Bandwagon” is the screen adaptation of the Arthur
Schwartz-Howard Dietz 1931 musical that starred Fred Astaire.

‘-“Mr. Astaire is also in the screen version and it would be just
words on my part to comment about a person whose veryname ’

is analg'ous to the term ‘.‘dan’ce.” Helisat his ‘peak in this ﬁlm and

Book Center Gets New Look

Organized Selections

According to the new mana-
ger, well-organized text and sup-
plementary book selections are
the heart of meeting the require-
ment and, desiresof a continual
flow of new students. By person-
ally checking students’ complaints,
he hopes to, encourage “a great
deal of co-operation, with allstu-
dents benefiting.”

Balagna has planned the
,store’s displays and frequent
sales to draw in students to
browse" and select titles for
their personal‘ collections. He
has moved ahead the Book
Center opening time to 8:30.
a.m., one hour earlier than pre-
viously, and is planning extra
evening openings’ for the be-
ginning of the winter term.
Additional check-out personnel
and ‘facilities will be available
at the start of. each term to
sped textbook. distribution.

Ticket sales for the major con-
cert and cultural programs of the
area will continue in the rear of
the store. Balagna stated that “All
students are welcome atour Wed-
nesday afternoon book reviews
and Friday afternoon student cof-
fee hours.” , ,

Complaints,

Concerning recent complaints of
the-Book Center’s many services
and high sales level, Balagna com-
mented, “if in ,maintaining our
services, otherstores lose busi-
ness, it is just the result of our
serving the needs of a large ur-
ban university.” '

“Our proﬁt margin "near 3%,”
he noted, “is the only thing
which enables us to continue -
expansion of our _ stocks and
improvement of our services.
Students should share in the
cost of our extra services, since
they beneﬁt from them.”

, The Book Centersselection of
5,000 current titles is only a
small fraction of the resources
of the University Libraries. How-
ever,. most new academic titles
and many novels are displayed
before the libraries could process
them for borrowing.

Special Order

Special order service is main-
tained so that customers may ob-'
tain any Amreican book in print
within two weeks. Although or-
ders for foreign books are sent
by airmail, ocean shipment of the
books can cause up to a month’s
delay. However, quick order ser-
vice is available on British books
from the New York branches of
Macmillan Co., Oxford and Cam-
bridge University Presses.

The Book Center staff is work-
ing with the Olﬁce for Regional
Education «and the deans of the
regional campuses
many books as possible to the
students at Johnstown, Bradford,

texts are available V for their

selection of supplementary books.

The Graduate Teaching Internship Program
offers liberal arts students the chance to teach
while obtaining a M. Ed. degree. Students who
were under the undergraduate education curric-
ulum may ‘also teach-study. Both liberal arts
students and education students can gain their
M. Ed. degre through the internship program.

Dr. Maxine Roberts, director of the program,
says that “while the internship program was de-
signed primarily to provide an‘_ opportunity for
liberal arts graduates to enter the ﬁeld of edu-
cation, it, also enables education graduates to
earn their M. Ed. degree and permanent certiﬁ-
cation in a shorter time than otherwise possible.”

, Although'the program has two curricula, ac- H
cording to Dr. "Roberts, "one for liberal arts grad-

uates which takes about 13 months, and one for
education graduates which takes about 11 months,
' they are 'the. same except for the extra two-
month summer session in which the liberal arts
graduate, who has not had student teaching prac-

tice like the education graduate, must take cer-7

tain education courses before he can teach.
_ Interns Teach '

. Secondary school interns can teach in a pub-
lic school in Pittsburgh or the surrounding area
full-time for either the first or second semester
of the public school year or half-time for the en-
tire school year. Elementary school interns, how-
ever, can teach only full-time for either the first
or second semester. -

Interns in secondary school. have the choice
of teaching English, social studies, foreign lan-
guages, sciences, math, business education, or
physical education. Interns in elementary school

' may teach kindergarten or a grade from first
through sixth, or may specialize in physical
education. \

Dr. Roberts stressed that _the intern teacher
is considered a regular teacher with the full re-

sponsibility that accompanies any teaching posi- -

tion. Helreceives a salary of $2,200-$2,500, which
is half the salary of beginning teachers, for his

half-time services. This salary is paid by. the pub-‘

lic school system, not the University.
‘ Credits ‘Vary " »
In addition to the six credits he gets for

 teaching, a liberal arts intern must take 36 cred-
itsand an education intern, 30. These credits are»

distributed among three categories: foundation
courses, i.e., the history, philosophy, and psychol-
ogy of education; courses related to the develop-
ment of professional competence; and graduate
study in the academic disciplines.
Two programs ofstudy are" available to the
intern and there is considerable ﬂexibility
within each. Option 1, recommended for liber-

Helps Both  

WLA And Education Graduates

al arts graduates, permits a major concentra-
tion in foundations and professional work, with
ten credits of graduate electives in academic

, ﬁelds. Option 2 provides for a major concen-

tration in the academic areas, with 20 -credits
in this ﬁeld. V

According to Dr. Roberts, who is also coor-I
dinator of the elementary school division of the '

program, there have been ,“18 or 20 elementary
school interns each year. This year 95 per cent
are liberal arts graduates, while in the past there
was about a 50-50 ratio between liberal arts
graduates and education graduates.
' _Figures Up .

Dr.’ Samuel Francis, coordinator of the sec-
ondary school division, reports somewhat dif-
ferent figures for -his interns. ‘The secondary
school interns,” he says, “have, increased from
18" the first year to 92 this year. Also, eachviyear
there have been about two liberal arts gradu-

ates for every one education graduate in the sec: _

ondary divisions.” . , _
While it has been possible to place all -the _
interns in jobs so _far, without any trouble, Dr.

Francisistressed the ‘need for more math and

science’ interns.’ ‘ « _ -

,“We counsel our people very" -closely,”_ Dr.
Francis pointed out. “There is- one faculty ad-
visor,” Dr. Roberts elaborated, “for every ﬁve
interns, who observes and helps the intern once
a week. Also there are supervisors and depart-
ment heads from the public schools who observe
the interns.” ’\ - ’

University Pays 1

Besides the fact that interns earn money for
their teaching, th e University pays for six of
their credits with the money it received from
the Ford Foundation grant the program was
awarded in June 1960. “The rest of the grant,”

Dr. Roberts remarked, “is used to hire more and

better faculty members to help the,interns.”
Requirements ' for admission to the intern-
ship program include a «minimum overall Q;P.A.
of‘ 2.5 (4 point system) in undergraduate’

school, achievement of an acceptable score -on -

the University of Pittsburgh -Graduate“ Stu-

dents Examination or the Miller Analogies Test, .

and satisfactory "ratings ‘in interviews with
three faculty members of» the School of Edu-
cation and with representatives of the cooper-
ating school system. i

All interested students ar e encouraged “to
come up and see. us”' about the internship‘ pro-
gram, concluded Dr. Roberts,‘ 2617 CL., and Dr.

_ Francis, 2628 CL. Those interested in -physical
' education should see Dr. Karl Oerman, 2633 CL.

Dr. George Anderson, 2501 CL.,’, will answer
questions about business education.

DECK THE HALLS

 The time has come‘ to think of Christmas shopping, for the

Yuletide will be upon us quickerthan you can-say‘Ja.ck Robin-
son. , (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the origin
of-;-this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say Jack
Robinson”? Well, sin, the original saying was French-“Plus

‘vile que de ,dii'e Jacques Robespierre.” Jack Robinson is, as every-

one knows, an Anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who was,

as everyone knows, the, famous ﬁgure from the'Fren.ch Revolu- _

tion who, as everyone'knqws,' got murdered in his bath by
D'anton,'Murat~, Caligula, and Al Capone.

-(The reason .people ‘started saying “Quicker,than you can
say Jacques R0bespierre”—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in
English-speaking countries like England, the U:S., and Cleve-

land—is quite an interesting little story.‘ It seems that Robes- _
pierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to murder _

her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his life was
call his name and warn him. But, alas, qui zkerthan she could

say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from her old‘ .

friend Frederic Chopin who was down in. Majorca setting lyrics

   

élzé  . 

to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he needed
Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not ﬁnd a
rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges could not refuse
such an urgent request. ' ‘
(Well sir, off to Majorca went Georges, but before she left,
she told her little daughter Walter that some bad men were
coming to murder'Daddy in his bath. She instructed Walter
to shout Robespierre’s name the moment the bad men arrived.
But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning on the
Riviera, and she had come home with a big bag of salt water
taffy, and when theqbad men arrived" to murder Robespierre,“

(Walter, alas, was chewing a Wad of. talfy and could not get her

mouth unstuck in time to shout a warning. Robespierre, alas,
was murdered quicker than you could say Jacques Robespierre
-—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in English-speaking countries.

(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer
in this grisly tale. When Georges Sandi got to Majorca, she did
succeed in helping Chopin ﬁnd a. rhyme for"‘Warsaw” as every-

" one knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:

In the fair town of Warsaw,
, Which Napoleon’s horse saw,
Singing coclcles and mussels, alive alive 0!)
But I digress. , _ . ,
We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we‘ all try to
ﬁnd at Christmas is, of course, unusual and distinctive gifts for

. our friends. May I suggest then a. carton of Marlboro Cigarettes?

What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboro;

as unusual? You had regarded them as famil_iar, reliable smokes _

whose excellence varied. not one jot nor tittle from year to year?

True. All true. But all thesame, Marlboros are unusual be-, A _

cause every time you try one,’ it’s like the first time. The ﬂavor
never palls, the ﬁlter nevergets. hackneyed,.the soft pack is
ever a new delight,-and so is the Flip Topbox, Each Marlboro
is afresh and pristine pleasure, and if you want all your friend
to clap their hands and cry, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus!” you will see that their stockings are ﬁlled with Marl-
boros on Christmas mom. a 1963 Max Sliulman

I at 

The holiday ‘season or any other season is the season to be
jolly—if Marlboro is your brand. You’ll find Marlboros wher-
ever cigarettes are sold in all ﬁfty states of the Union. You
get a lot to like in Marlboro Country.

President Norm Edelstein
Laments Plight of Group ‘

By BILL NIEDERBERGER. —

Old Jack never would have made “The Golden

Book” without a beanstalk. Nobody wins a bat-

‘ ting title unless he has first made the baseball
team.

And a service organization like Circle K is
nothing unless the University gives it something
to do, laments Norm Edelstein, charter president
of that organization.

“We wait and wait and wish the University
would call on us,” says Edelstein, “but they never
do.” '

All Services Free

Circle K is the collegiate service organization
sponsored by the Kiwanis Club». The more than
500 chapters on campuses throughout the nation
offer free services for campus functions to each
university. ‘

“Every university chapter has plenty to do
except us,” says Edelstein. “Surely there’s
something for us to do on campus, whether’, it’s
ushering at some affair, helping the Dean of
Men, answering telephones—anything! They

. pay money to hire ushers and such and here
we are—rea_dy to work ‘for free.” A

“How can we be at service organization if
nobody-here takes advantage of us and lets us
do something?” Edelstein asked.‘ A K

Under the leadership of Howie Kramer, cur-
rent president, and Edelstein, Circle K_ has
worked on Health 0’ Ramas around the area,
washed cars, sold rubber name-stamps, ﬁlled,
wrapped and sent out CARE packages to for-
eign countries, donating all proceeds to charity.-
“The administration doesn’t want us to help.
So we go outside to do our work,” said Edel-
stein. ’ ' T i

The biggproject of the last few weeks was the
touch football game between Circle K members.
and Phi Sigma Sigma Sorority. ~The proceeds
go to the Juvenile Court Orphans Home and the
Western, Pennsylvania School for the Blind. ‘

_, ' Kiwanis Interested

The Kiwanis Club maintains an-" active inter-
est in its offspring organization. Besides direct
sponsorship Kiwanis offers the-boys adviceion
vocations and activites. Three or four Kiwanians

- are always present at each Circle K meeting.

“When we start something, we follow it"
through,” says Dr. Joseph Polk, the Oakland
Kiwanis‘ advisor to Circle K.

I New Members Sought
.-The club wants new members. _“Too many
of the fellows are graduating,” said,Kramer,‘the
president. “We invite any freshmen to come up
to see us in 314 SU. They can get afree lunch »

 

‘ . _ . . ..

SENDING CARE PACKAGES is one of the’ com-
munity service‘ work that Circle K does under
leadership of Norman Edelstein and. Howard
Kramer.- ’

' and watch a meeting.”
cording to'Edelstein,_ are that‘a prospective mem-
ber have an acceptable hcademic record and the

Z desire to work. '

But membership in the club is not all work,
said Kramer. “We hold one big social project
'each month. Just.a few weeks ago weiheld a
big hayride in North Park with a bonfire and

' roast. These socials are .paid for out of the
cllub dues of $7 per trimester. $2.50 of that
amount goes to the national and state organi-

zations of Circle K.

. So, as Circle K rolls‘ along on its quiet, do-
good way, one plea is heard and is directed to the
administration:

“We’re avaiuable.
Please.”

Take advantage ‘of us.

Peterson Sells ‘Magic Lantern’ ‘Teaching Aid  

(Continued from Page‘ 12)
to fix an immediate — and lasting — impres-
sion in the student’s mind.

The professor said-that teachers always want
to add something of their own but that the sys-
tem gives them a “real core” from which to
work. His freshman class of 320 students was
interested, he stated, because of the system. “If
I didn’t do this in a class that big, they’d sleep
or read The Pitt News.

A _ -Suitable for ‘All

The “magic lantern” is now‘ being used for
large classes but Peterson says it is suitable for
smaller sizes. “People have ‘associated it with
large classes only,” said the professor, “but it’s
just as good in a class of ﬁfteen. Some of the
freshmen instructors use it.”

>7

Already 42 schools have contracted to buy
the “magic lantern” — sight unseen. Science
Research Associates of Chicago is handling the
nationwide manufacture and sale of the teach-
ing_ aid, and Mr. Peterson is doing some cross-
country jaunting to pass the word.

The idea came from a football coach, said
Peterson. “He used a projector and slides to
show his play diagrams instead of the usual
chalk blackboard.” The system is the result of
four years intensive study and twenty years of
experimentation. Peterson has been ‘a writing
instructor at the University since 1927.-

“The older students have to get over the idea
that audio-visual teaching is kindergarten stuff,”
he said. “This method is possibly the nearest
thing to a breakthrough in the teaching of
writing. This thing is the answer.”

Regional Students Visit
Main Campus, Students
Approximately 350 s t u d e n t s

During their stay students were
housed in the Towers and wom-
en’s dormitories. After, receiving
housing‘ assignments, the visitors
went on guided tours of the cam-
pus. After dinner they attended
the Dick Gregory performance at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial,
followed. by’ an activity in the
Student Union.

On Saturday the students had
brunch with Chancellor Litch- .
ﬁeld; ‘later they attended the Penn
State game and returned home
afterwards.  ‘

Sorority Suites Summer.  
‘ A Rental Made Optional

By NANCY DELANEY  

The University will offer the sororities which rent
suites in Amos Hall an. option on-whether or not they
wish to turn their suites over to the University during
the summer and thus eliminate the charge for rent
during those months, revealed Savina Skewis, Associate
Dean _of Women. ’ . .

Miss Skewis explained at Panhellenic Council on
Wednesday that under the present system, besides pay-
ing rent, each sorority must pay the cost of housing 15 ’

. girls in their suite each year. ‘ '

Many sororiti_es have difﬁculty meeting this num-
ber since it requires that, even if the maximum of six
girls lives in the suite during the fall and winter terms,
at least three must also live there during the summer
term. ‘

  
 

T Only ten girls a year . g ' '-
Under the new system, the sorority would be re-
quired to have only ten girls a year live in the suite, 1
They would, however, have no access to their suites
during the summer, when the suites would be occupied; ,
by “selected olderwomen” studying at the University.
.The sororities would still be expected to supply a house- ~
mother to live in the ‘suite during the ‘summer. -
Miss Skewis‘. also indicated that, as far as she is ‘
concerned, the sororities are permanently settled in ’
Amos Hall. In light of this, Panheljs making plans
to furnish an unﬁnished room on the 11th floor of
Amos Hall to use as a lounge. _ ' ' .

Three Peace Corps veterans also spoke at the Panhel
meeting. Carol Burnes, who had served ingthe Philippine "
Islands, Gloria Huston from the West -Indies, and Gary
Schultz from Africa explained to the group their duties _
as members of the Peace Corps, and the critical need for .
volunteers.

Help Space Program
The program of study of earth

"tides was held by Litchﬁeld to be

“fundamental to a space pro-
gram.” He said, “This is space re-
search of the most vital nature
in that it probes for an under-
standing of. basic information
about our solar system.”

Earthquakes prediction may
be one other beneﬁt of this un-
derground research. The scien-
tists hope to learn of the earth’s
upper layers from the study of

the long waves emitted by
earthquakes.
“It is possible that magnetic

studies on sections of the earth
having a high frequency of earth-
quakes could lead to the develop-
ment of an earthquake forewarn-
ing system,” said Dr. A. F. Fred-
erichson, chairman of the depart-

, ment of Earth and Planetary Sci-

ences at the University.

New methods of data interpre-
tation may also lead to reliable
nuclear blast detection.

Delta Tau Delta Gets Library,

Delta Tau Delta’s annual
homecoming for alumni and
active members on Friday was
highlighted by the presenta-
tion of a library on the first
ﬂoor of the chapter house.

The program began with a din-
ner at 5:30 p.m., which was fol-
lowed by the presentation of the
library in memory of Alexander
Steele Chalfante. Chalfante, a
1933 graduate of the University
became president of the A.M.
Byers Company before the age of
ﬁfty. He was killed in an auto-
mobile accident last summer.

Norman MacLeod, member of
the University Board of Trustees
and former national president of
Delta Tau Delta fraternity,pre-
sented the library on behalf of
the alumni.

Two Alums Select

Two of the fraternity’s alumni,
Dr. Charles R. Crow of the Uni-
versity English department and
William B. Harvey, head of the
University Press of New York
University are directing the selec-
tion of books for the library.

In addition to the dedication,
the fraternity honored two of
its alumni, Edgar C. Cannon,

The Serpent
And The Rope

By VIJAY JAIN

“The Serpent and the Rope (Pantheon Books, a division of Random House, $5.95)
introduces to American readers India’s greatest novelist,” the blurb on the inside jacket of

the book proclaims. The back cover contains excerpts from reviews‘ the book received in
the English press —— all in superlatives. I beg to differ!

The narative deals with the problems that an orthodox Hindu and

his French spouse

face as they ﬁnd that oldcultural ties haunt their marriage — love notwithstanding.

The novel beihg semi-autobio-
graphical, we assume that all the
ramifications of such an involve-
ment are accurately represented
as drawn from personal experi-
ence.

N Side—Flourishes Detract ,

The main theme of the book
is thus clearly outlined and well
handled. It is the side-flourishes

that detract’ from the pleasure
that may be derived from a per-

To" lend an air of authenti-
city and perhaps to set up the
proper mood and atmosphere,
Raja Rao, the author, insists on
quoting freely from verses in
Sanskirt and French. This in
moderation could, perhaps, have
enhanced the poetic beauty of
the work, but excessive use of
this device has only served to
detract from the effectiveness of
such quotations. _

They distract and annoy the A

reader as most such quotations are

‘left unconnected in the text and »

always unexplained as well. Even.
with a knowledge of both lan-
guages such side excursions are
displeasing to the reader.
‘Lack of Authenticity V
Mr. Rao also takes liberties in
depicting the post war India when
the action in‘ the novel takes place.
He portrays the country. in the
very stereotype that foreigners
are accustomed to picture it. '

No doubt an artist may take
some license with the truth if it
is done for a specific‘: purpose or
to‘ achieve‘ some special“ effect,
but to distort the facts for.'no-
reason other than to make the
image compitable to the one
abroad is‘ intellectual dishon-
esty. ’ »

The air of mysticism that the
author creates and conveys, to the
reader through the title and
glossary, which explain some of
the terms used in the book, con-
tributes little to the theme. If

Some Rough Spots

The author shows a command
of the English, language with a
few apparent rough spots occuring
wher_e he wishes to convey the
impression that the dialogue is
translated from the vernacular
for the reader’s‘beneﬁt. This im-

pression could, perhaps, have "been
conveyed by resorting to some
other device, if needed at all, and
retaining the smooth ﬂow uni-
formly throughout the book.

The time element is well
‘handled and the technique of

flashbacks is fully exploited.
Coupled, they lend an air of
genuine urgency and portray
the mental ‘activity that the
narrative demands. .

The ﬁrst person narration gives
the reader some-_ insight about the
Indian philosophy and its out-
look on life. This may be the
greatest value of the book.

On the whole it is a well-writ-

ten and interesting book unde-
serving of all the plaudits it re-
ceived, yet worth reading for its
uniqueness of the subject matter,
the kindwhich one is not likely
to ﬁnd in his usual reading list.

wheel is mounted on an arm that extends from a
center-mounted column. The wheel: swings upward

position at the touch of a button. Power adjustment
enables it to be moved three inches fore and aft and

  Generalovich Ponders
Future Grid Career

By BOB SNHZIK
Brian Generalovich, the 6-foot-4 All-America basketball

, candidate, says he has his eyes squarely on the upcoming

basketball season. He hopes to lead the Panthers to another
NCAA tournament invitation.

But an old problem is nagging at “The General.” To play
football or not to play. An All-State tackle at‘ Farrell High
School, Generalovich has passed up football here in favor of
basketball, much to the dis-
may of the Panther foot-
ball coaches.

The reason Generalo-
vich always gave for not
playing football was that he

could not afford to spend
that much time away from

made up on a career as a
dentist and he wanted to be
sure he had the grade to get
into dental school.

Realizes Ambition’

Generalovich will real-
ize his ambition next Sep-
tember when he expects to
enter dental school. His
basketball eligibility will be
up, but he can still play
football. He will still. be a
one sport man.

BR ENERALOVICH
Ponders Future

“The next football season is a long way off,” Generalovich
said. “I think I'd like to go out for the team, but a lot of
things can happen between now and then. _ '

“But the main thing,” Generalovich continued, “is that I
don’t want to be bothered about playing football now. We’ve
got a basketball season starting Saturday and that’s where my

.- sports ambitions center right now.”

‘. Coaches Want Him M '
One thing is for sure. The football coaches won’t try to
‘dissuade Generalovich from coming out for the team.

They lose ﬁve lettermen ends. this season and the way

Howley. A pair of well-thought-of sophomores—John Verkleer-

Swim Times

isappomtmg

The Panther varsity team held
their annual Blue-Gold ‘intra-
squad swim last Wednesday at
Trees. Hall. -

In reference to the swim, as-
sistant coach Will Weisz said,
“They got a lot of work out for

them before the North Carolina M

State meet which is this Saturday.
The only other chance we’ll have
to show what we can do before
the season starts is in a relay
meet with Carnegie _Tech tomor-
row. The intra-squad swim. did
not impress me at all.”
Weisz was not the only one

.disappointed about the times

handed in by the Panther squad.
Senior freestyler Rick Petter-
son expresed his disappoint-

_ ment about the times.

Petterson said, “The times were

‘ poor and we’ll have to work hard-

er. Some of the guys were tired,
and it is pretty hard to get up for
something like this. I don’t want
to offer any excuses. We did poor-
ly and "/e’ll have to work harder.
That’s about all there is to it, ex-
cept that we’ll be up for N.C.
State.”

Although the squad did not do
exceptionally well, both Weisz and
Petterson felt that some plain
hard work would certainly help to
bring down some of the times.

Tom Ribarchak, 100 yard free-
style record holder, recuperating
from a broken ankle, did not com-
pete in the meet, but has been

Gymnastics Team 1
Looking Forward
To Good Campaign

Coach Warren Neiger’s gym-
nastics team, which lost two of
its best performers by graduation,
is looking forward to an improved
season.

According to Neiger, the loss-
of Ed Zamecnik and Jack Lehner,
who ﬁnished fourth in the 1963
EIGL _all-around and long horse
events respectively, will hurt the
team. Neiger feels, however,.that
the work of seniors Tom ‘Misage,
Roland James,’ Ed Stim and John’
Franchuk and sophomores David
McKinnis, Bob Davies, and Al
Leonard will compensate for these
losses.

McKinnis, James, and Stim will
compose the side horse team
which Neiger describes as ”one
of the best I've ever had.” While
Stim will be the key man in the
all-around, and Misage and Fran-
chuk, who have been hampered
by injuries, will be experienced
men on the horizontal and par-
allel bars respectively.

It won’t take much to ‘improve
on.last season’s team which won
only one meet. The nucleus of
this year’s team is madeup mostly
of last year’s performers. But
Neiger feels the added experience

and help from the sophomores ,
twill be the difference.

Soccer Team, Coach, Members  
Retain Optimism for Next Year

By FRED MARCUS

“I’m looking forward quite optimistically to
next season,” said soccer coach Leo Bemis, after
his'sophomore—heavy squad ﬁnished with a 5-5
record. -_ . g '

“We developed into a pretty solid defensive
team. I don’t think. our last game (a 4-2 loss

— ' to Penn State) was
representative of how
our defense has been
doing." And we won’t
lose much defensively
next year.” The only
expected losses are

' goalie Tom Staab, who
graduates,
Gene Balkovec, who
expects to enter medi-
cal school. ‘
f‘We started with a
_ _ lot of inexperience,”
Bemis said. “We’ve gained a lot of experience.

 

0111‘ Physical condition was pretty good. Some’

of the fellows could have been ten pounds
lighter,"but we’ll work on that for next year."
I don’t think that had too much bearing" though.”

Bemis expects several freshmen to have a
chance to play a lot next year. He expects Ferd

and back ‘

10t3, and Jim Snyder to have a chance for the’

inside position being vacated by senior co—cap-
tain Bruno Schwartz, in addition to other pos-
sible positions they might play.. i ’

“Bruno was a good, steady ballplayer, and_
he was especially good at defense,” Bemis said.

Bemis experimented at center forward with‘
three players. George Shimpeno showed up best,
scored two goals in each of the. last two games,
and is expected to make even a ‘better showing
next ‘year. _ .

Bemis feels that Ken Lang, Staab’s under-
study for the last two years, freshman Dennis
Schweber, and Ron Mitchell should all have a
chance for the position of startiriggoalie.

He feels that his bench strength, which was
very strong this year, should improve even more
with the experience. “This is a game you learn
by playing,”’ he said. He feels that the" team can
use some more finesse and work onball control,
butfhe also feels the. short pass'game is helping
the team, « J- ‘

“It made us strong.er,"on the outside defen-
sively,” he said. '“Few balls were kicked out of

fullbacks this year as compared to several last

last year soared Thursday night as the Panthers defeated
St. Francis, 102-56 in a» controlled scrimmage at the Field

Despite the fact that St. Francis lost three of their
starters in the last ‘two ,weeks, they still brought a strong

team centered around Sandy Wil-G

  

Daryle Ruby and Bill Mclntyre.
Lovette scored 13 points and lead
the team in rebounds with nine.

Ruby had 16 points and six,
rebounds. Timons said, “Lov-
ette looked beter than he ever
did. He rebounded and scored
well. i '

“I was real pleased with Ruby.
He took up the slack when’Brian
was unable to continue. Mclntyre
was really hustling. He missed
a lotvby not playing last year, but
he’s coming along nicely.”

Cites Guard Play

Timmons also stressed the good
work of his guards. He said, "‘It’s
tough to get the ball through
Grgurich, Roman or Shelﬁeld.
They’ve all improved so much
that we can afford to take more
chances at stealing the ball.

“We’ll play the ball more this
year instead ‘of the man. ’ Also,
if the opposing guards ‘get by
our back court men, the play-
ers up front can pick them up.
I was pleased with our defen-
sive play.” »

If'Timmons uses the same start-
ing lineup as he used Thursday,
he will have ﬁve players all of
whom are capable of scoring in
double ﬁgures. Last season Krie-
gar, Roman, Generalovich. and
Shefiield scored in double ﬁgures.
Sauer ended up with a nine point
average. ,

Geophysical Plan

The University is going
/underground for an extensive
study of earth physics as part
of a new geophysical program
in its Space Research Coor-
dination Center, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld has announced.

The research will be conducted
at an underground station to be
located somewhere in Western
Pennsylvania, possibly in an un-
derground mine, according to
‘Litchﬁeld. ’

.Sponsoring‘the research will be
the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Sur-
vey. Litchﬁeld added that the
station may one day be expanded
to become part of a world-wide
ring of seismic stations being es-
tablished to develop ways of de-
tecting far off nuclear blasts.
