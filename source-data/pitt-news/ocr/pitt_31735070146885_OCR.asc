Pittsburgh Student Environmental Coalition to join Marcellus Shale Protest this week

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

The national debate over Marcellusashale
drilling has come to Pitt, and students
are making their own contributions to
the issue.

Founded in November 2009, the Pitts-
burgh Student Environmental Coalition
is a new addition to the activism scene
in Pittsburgh. The coalition, which has

Duquesne, Chatham, Carnegie Mellon
and the Community College of Allegheny
County, addresses both local and national
environmental concerns. V
. In recent days, the coalition has fo-

‘ cused on Marcellus Shale drilling in Penn-

sylvania, the effects of which have been
debated across the state,’

Members of PSEC have been involved _

in environmental student organizations
in their own universities, including Free
The Planet at Pitt. Members said the co-

Eva Resnick-Day, a member of both
Free The Planet and PSEC, said the coali-
tion’s scope extends beyond the campus.
With the added resources of the other
universities, she said PSEC can have a
stronger Voice that reaches the entire

»city. But, she added, the process is differ-

ent for a city—spanning coalition.‘ '

Halloween
brings out
characters

Shae’ Felicien

Ghosts, animals~and reality television stars ——
with plenty 0 “sexy” preﬁxes — descended
on Oakland this past weekend." '

Ofﬁcially, Halloween didn’t start until
Sunday, but that didn’t stop hundreds of
costume-clad students from hitting the streets
Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. A quick
walking tour of South Oakland revealed what

some students expected and hoped for all .

week: a myriad of house parties and street
celebrations marking one of the most popular
party weekends of the fall semester.

This year’s costumes appeared as varied as
they were repetitive. Women clad in bunny or

H‘ cat costumes, or maid or nurse outﬁts could
be seen on every block. The men donned their
archetypal superhero, cowboy and football
costumes.

On the cornerof Forbes and Meyran av-
enues Saturday night, aman spending the
night as Michaeljackson danced with sopho-
more Alexandria Dowels, who was wearing a
Nicki Minaj costume. The king of pop sported

. a red leather jacket, complete with ajheri curl,
white glove and tight black pants.

“I’m bad,” the pseudo-Jackson said, staring:

down a pharaoh also crossing the street.

“I know my chick bad-,’.’ the Pharaoh replied A

in playful Halloween banter. -
“Where you going, PYT?” Jackson asked
g as the original pair parted ways. Minaj, or
rather Dowels, threw him a smile before con-
tinuing on. V
- In her bright makeup, white wig, pink cor-
set, black leggings and matching tutu she was
quickly identiﬁed by a group across the street
and received many shouts from “fans.”

the Pitt junior said.

Lorraine Keeler, a Pitt sophomore, said
that education and spreading awareness
can lead to action. To educate Pittsbur-

‘ ghers, the group has passed out ﬂiers and

other protest literature.

“If you can educate people enough,
you have to hope [they will] try to make
changes,” she said. i

PSEC plans to contribute to a protest
on Wednesday scheduled to start at Al-
legheny Landing on the North Shore and

, conclude with a rally outside of the David

L. Lawrence Convention Center.

The Marcellus Shale Protest, described
on its website as “an information clear-
ing house,” is the main organizer of the
scheduled protest. The group will lead
a march around Downtown Pittsburgh
with the aim of establishing a sustainable

grassroots movement that will combat .

Marcellus Shale drilling.

PSEC is one ofthe many endorsers of
the protest. The money the group has
raised since its inception late last year
has gone mostly to signs they plan on
displaying at the protest.

“Stop fracking now. Go to class later,”
is one of PSEC’s slogans, said Seth Bush, a
PSEC and Free The Planet member. Bush

added that he thinks the protest and so-
cial engagement might be worth skipping
class for.

“Activism doesn’t mean running
around breaking Pamela’s windows,”
Bush said, referencing vandalism that
occurred during last year’s G-20 Sum-
mit protests.

Not everyone agrees that fracking is
dangerous for the environment. The En-
vironmental Protection Agencyddeclared
fracking safe after a 2004 study.

The fracking process involves pumping
water at high pressure into shale forma-
tions to break up the rock, freeing natural
gas, in a process called hydraulic fractur-
ing, or “fracking.”

The fracking liquid, more than 90 per— L

cent water and sand before being pumped
into the well, contains a number of chemi-
cals like hydrochloric acid, methanol and
boric acid, which can be detrimental to
the sanitation of natural water sources
and groundwater. After breaking up the
rock, the liquid needs to be disposed of
carefully to avoid contamination.
According to the EPA’s study, which

“Heeyyy!” she responded with a wave, not
breaking her stride. '

“Some [attention] is good, some is bad,”
Dowels said. “Some are jokes and some are
creepers, but if they’re j okesters, like that
Michaeljackson, you can talk to them. They’re
funny.”

Dowels rejoined her friends, Rachel
Browning and Joelle Urquhart, costumed as
Michael “Michelle”]ordan and Steve “Stepha-
nie” Urkel.

Walking down Atwood Street at midnight
revealed that Halloween is much more than
just trick-or—treating and costumes. For many,
the holiday offered a chance for people to be
something other than themselves.

“You can be anything that you want to be,
and no one will make fun of you,” said an un-
costumed sophomore, Kolujarboi. “It’s cool
to see that you can step out of yourself for that
one day. We all want to do it sometimes — just

be someone else or do something different.” ‘

Jarboi was not alone in this philosophy.
' “I love seeing peoplein their truest ele-
ments having the greatest time that they pos-

, sibly can,” said Mike Gordon, a junior, dressed
as a Black Tee Gang member, identiﬁable by 4

his plain, black T-shirts and assortment of
drawn-on tattoos.

' quiet one.

“This weekend was ridiculous, fun, great,
all the good adjectives,” Gordon said. “Nothing
bad can happen on Halloween night. Hallow-
een is all about fun.”

In anticipation of this weekend’s festivities,
some University officials, like Shawn Brooks,
associate dean of students, took time to re-
mind students that no costume can protect
them from poor decision making.

“If you choose to participate in any Home-
coming or Halloween activities, you should be
aware of the consequences of being involved
with any unlawful or destructive behavior
that leads to violations against the Student
Code of Conduct,” Brooks said in a message
sent Thursday night to students living in resi-
dence halls. '

Brooks“ forewarned students that viola-
tions of the law or Student Code of Conduct
could subject them to ﬁnes, restitution, disci-
plinary probation, disciplinary suspension or
dismissal from the Universityin more serious
cases. .

Brooks said both city and Pitt police would
be on alert for anyone violating open container
laws, engaging in underage drinkingor cases
of criminal mischief.

More than half a dozen police cars could

be seen patrolling the Oakland streets this '

weekend, driving slowly. I

Finding a pollution solution

examined the risks of hydraulic fracking,

“There was little to no risk of fracturing
fluid contaminating underground sources
of drinking water during hydraulic frac-
turing of coal-bed methane—production
wells.”

The EPA retained the right, however,
“to conduct additional studies in the fu-
ture,” according to its website.

Travis Windle, a spokesman for the
Marcellus Shale Coalition, a lobbying or-
ganization for natural gas drilling compa-
nies, said hydraulic fracturing is “tightly
regulated and environmentally sound.”

Windle also pointed to reports that

ing water will be the major focus of the
study, according to the EPA website.

In late 2009, Dimock, Pa., experi-
enced a series of leaks from the natural
gas wells, while their water supply was
simultaneously polluted by high levels
of methane, according to The New York
Times. 1

Bush said he believes fracking is to
blame for the pollution, although Windle
said the contamination was an “oil and
casing issue” and had nothing to do with
hydraulic fracturing.

indicate that allowing wider drilling
in Pennsylvania could add as many as
212,00ojobs, plus more than $1.8 billion
in state and local tax revenues, according
to a news release on the Marcellus Shale
Coalition website.

. He said the shale drilling is a “historic
opportunity for" Pittsburgh.”

Members of PSEC have disagreed, at.
least for now. ' ‘

“PSEC is trying to stay in the middle.
We don’t know if [shale drilling] is safe,
so we shouldn’t do it,” said Bush, a Pitt
junior. T v

Currently, the EPA plans to conduct
an additional study into shale drilling. It
plans to initiate the study in early 2011
and have initial study results available
by late 2012. The correlation between
fracking and its potential risks to drink-

drilling in Pittsburgh, also believes that
hydraulic fracturing could be detrimental
to Pittsburgh’s water supply.

He said there is no way to process the
water to completely eliminate the pollu—
tion that results from fracking. He added
that it’s possible to dilute the water, but
the chemistry would still be there, in
Pittsburgh’s drinking supply.

“The larger community has a larger
investment than what’s below our feet.

. In Pennsylvania, it should be the number

one concern — it’ll be the [students’]
world tomorrow,” Shields said.

Shields also said that student involve~
ment in the environmental issue is criti-
cal. ‘

away more vested in this than anyone
else,” Shields said. I

EDITORIAL

Blogging — with its self—publishing and
so-called “amateur journalism” -— is
not the most respected medium for re-
laying news and opinions.

After all, anyone can have a blog,
right?

It’s not surprising that most blogs
aren’t taken all that seriously, even if
they should be. .

But as the popularity of this writ-
ing form increases and most news and
entertainment forums begin attaching
their names to their own string of staff
blogs, the responsibility ofthe blogger
needs to increase to meet the standards
held for the printed word.

Last week, Marie Claire blogger
Maura Kelly wrote alblog post titled
“Should ‘Fatties’ Get a Room? (Even
on TV?)” about the CBS sitcom “Mike
& Molly,” a show about a couple who
meets in OvereatersvAnonymous.

In the post, Kelly responded to the
question, “Do you re_ally think people
feel uncomfortable when they see over-
weight people making out on televi-
sion?” _ . .

Although Kel'ly’s post mentioned how
“obesity is costing our country far more
in terms of all the related health prob.-
lems we are paying for, by way of our
insurance, than any other health prob-
lem, even cancer,” her argument soon
took a turn for the worse, or should we
say, the insulting. ‘

“I think I’d be grossed out ifI had
to watch two characters with rolls and
rolls of fat kissing each other ...‘because
I’d be grossed out ifl had to watchthem

Marie Claire gives  
bloggers bad name

brutally honest, even in real life, I ﬁnd
it aesthetically displeasing to watch a
very, very fat person simply walk across
a room.” A

Ouch.

According to the Huffington Post,
Marie Claire received more than 28,000
_e-mail responsesto the piece. _

Despite thelarge number of respons-

' es, the magazine stood by the post.

to be done differently in a way that is

Low turnout? Blame candidates,

Being less than eager to vote doesn’t necessarily translate into political apathy, says Hunter

Kayla Hunter
For The Pitt News

Any political thought I’ve ever had or
ideology I’ve honed or scrapped within‘
the past decade all began with punk
rock.

I was 13, impressionable, and had an
outspoken older sister with spiky black
hair. All I needed were a few months
of encountering bands with the word
“against” in their names and lyrics filled
with images of riots and bruises left
by police billy clubs and I was hooked:
an angsty, hormone—driven anarcho-
punk.

Then the Iraq war began, and I did
what any bewildered 14-year-old would
do - complained loudly to my best
friend on the phone and scribbled let-
ters to President Bush that were never
sent. I fantasized a lot about rallies and
protests in the next few years, but, hon-
estly, was too much of an introvert to get
involved in anything but Model U.N.

Now, in college, the story’s the same
— I’m not out there lying in front of
tanks, but I take classes on the global
and domestic issues that interest me
and vote with my wallet. And, yes, I
ran down Forbes Avenue flailing my
arms like a lunatic when Obama was
elected. '

But this year, something is different.
I don’t rush to my TV or computer any-
more to watch the President’s speech. I
avoid any headline about any politician.
And right now, I’m groaning about going
to the polls in November. ‘

Because, as much as I care about the
problems politicians are supposed to
fix, I feel as much brotherly affinity
for this present breed of sensationalist
celebrities posing~as candidates as I
do for celebrities ‘themselves — which
makes gathering the will to vote for one
abit unappealing, like choosing who
has the best Vaseline—coated teeth in
Miss America.

I know the criticism, that people
our age don’t vote because we’re ter-
ribly disengaged wastes of space, but
I’m saying that being less than eager to
vote doesn’t necessarily translate into
political apathy. Instead it can indicate
disillusionment with political repre-
sentatives, their dripping rhetorical
flourishes, and their usual inability to
do what they say the-y”re going to do.

And, beyond that, it can be a symp-
tom of an unfortunate feeling of power-
lessness in the face of the most powerful
government in the world, the recogni-
tion that the intricacies of the Ameri-
can political system are vastly more
complex than an average citizen — i.e.,
me —— can comprehend. —

For example,the day the health—care
bill was passed last spring, I spent all

afternoon scouring news articles and 7

synopses online, trying to decipher the
myriad ways it would effect the different
sectors of the population and whether I
could decide if it was, on balance, posi-
tive or negative. After several hours, I
went cross—eyed and quit.

" Yet you wouldn’t think there were
so many gray areas in the issues ‘if you

. watched the news or the raging debates

between the increasingly polarized po-
litical elite. This trend of polarization
is worrisome to me, especially as I grow
older, less extreme and a little more
-open-minded.Just when I’m able to take
my dad’s opinions about crunchy con-
servatism seriously — and even agree
with him on quite a few fronts —. the
politicians and pundits are opting to
look at things in black and white, put-
ting up blinders to certain inconvenient
facts and perspectives.

For people concerned with getting
the whole story, free’ of agenda, this
can make things tricky. Seth Bush, the
former president of Pitt’s environmen-
tal club Free the Planet, who’s lobbying
against drilling in the Marcellus Shale,
admitted hisfrustration that both sides
of the issue have certainlfacts wrong, or

A rather present statistics in a mislead-
_ ing way. “My main. goal right now is

educating people about the issue,” he
said. “But it’s hard when'the informa-
tion isn’t always clear.” Bush is a much
more politically optimistic and engaged
person than I am, but it goes to show
that this frustration with the effects of
polarization transcends levels of,politi-
cal awareness. s .

My question is, why does the politi-
_cal system have to function like this,
in a good versus evil way, when life is
never like that? Why do politicians keep
trying to get further and further away

_ from their opponents instead of find-

ing middle ground, where most oftheir

constituents are? I
Well, perhaps it isn’t‘altogether their

fault, but rather the culmination of out-

not voters

side pressure to present themselves in
a certain way, since the political elites
are constantly under unrelenting public
scrutiny — thanks in large part to their
longtime “frenemy,” the mass media.

Because we all know that whoever
screams the most nonsense the loudest
will definitely be on the front page in
the morning.

As much as I love pundits like Jon
Stewart’ and Stephen Colbert for mak-
ing politics fun, I can’t help but wonder
whether examining every facet of these
people’s lives takes a toll on the way they
perform, or even makes them sneakier
than they might have originallylbeen.
In a recent column in The New York
Times titled “Would You Run?” David
Brooks points out that, after all, what
matters to the public is not the good
in a po1itician’s career, but, rather, his
mistakes. “Nobody who walks into the
valley of our political system emerges
unscathed,” he says-

So whether the present state of poli-
tics is the fault of the nosy media or
the self-promoting politicians, greedy
special interests or insane radicals, I
can’t say —— nor will I place blame.

But I will say it’s a less than desirable
environment for everyone, especially
voters. .

Yet despite it all, come Nov. 2, this

former punk will drag herself to the

polls, more out ofa sense of obligation
than any real passion.

Because, then, when things get better‘

or get worse or don’t change at all, at
least I can say I tried.

Comments on the nature

Kozlowski< 7

“Some  child’s stomachjust growled;
Didn’t you hear it? You’ve got to listen
like me.”

I am also running to save the republic
from my Whig opponent, John Quincy
Adams of Quincy, Mass. Let me tell you
a little bit about him. He’s so extreme,
he votes with Nancy Pelosi 115 percent
of the time, making sure to vote twice
on some measures, and also sneaks onto
the House floor at midnight at times to
cast a vote for a bill that Nancy Pelosi
knows nothing about, but would have
voted for if she did.

As if this were not enough, my op-
ponent loves outsourcing. Can’t get
enough ofit. When he’s not busy ruining
the American dream by giving it away
to Lehman Brothers, he’s busy giving
jobs to the Chinese. Not only does he
support tax breaks for companies who

outsource, he doesthe moving ofa lot
of the heavy equipment for those corn.-
panies himself for no charge. He also
wants to increase taxes on businesses
that don’t outsource, thus driving them
overseas. In addition, he’s in favor of
not having businesses pay their fair
share by keepingthe‘ corporate tax rate
low. I’ll be sure that "businesses are
made to pay their fair share of taxes.

Why does my opponent favor out-,

sourcing? Because he’s evil and has no

scruples. He’s even bandying about the I

thought of outsourcing Wall Street to
China. Or maybe it was importing the
Chinese financial sector to the U.S.
Whatever. y '

' His lack of even a fractional scruple
has" shown itselfin other ways. His deal-
ings are unsavory in the extreme, and
he has made the most corrupt bargain

of political campaigns

of all: buying the presidency by offering
Henry Clay the position of secretary
of state. ~ r

And my Anti-Masonic Party oppo—_

nent? Why, he’s even worse. He is a
dangerous, right-wing Tea Party racist
sexist homophobic Islamophobic reli-
gious wingnut extremist who feeds on
hatred, anger, fear and name-calling.
I, on the other hand, am all for hope
‘ and post—partisan politics. He’s so rac-
ist, his policies led to George Wallace
filing an amicus briefin support of the
NAACP_ in 1964. Need I provide more
evidence? - ' -
And that’s not all. His history in of-

- fice is, as our forefathers described

abuses in a similar situation, a “history
of repeated injuries and usurpations,
‘all having indirect object the estab-
lishment of an absolute Tyranny over

these States. To prove this, let facts be ’

submitted to a candid world.
“He has refused his Assent to Laws,

' the most wholesome and necessary for

the public good... .

“He has erected a multitude of New
Offices, and sent hither swarms of Of-
ficers to harass our people, and eat out

their substance.”

And he has imposed Taxes on us
without our Consent.

He has also shamelessly plagiarized
lines from the Declaration of Inde-

pendence, claiming them as his own . »

work. V v -»

So, there is only one choice for the
people of this district. Don’t vote for
my opponents. I guess that sorta means
you should vote for me. _

Sara Pecora
For The Pitt News

 

Local bands Colonizing the Cosmos and
Meeting of Important People set the tone
for Halloween weekend Friday_ night, throw-
ing a Halloween Costume Ball Double Fea-
ture at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
in Shadyside. _

After a brief mixer, Josh Moyer, lead
singer of Colonizing the Cosmos and the
literal ringleader (he and the male members
of his band were dressed as circuspacts),
led everyone into the tent attached to the
building. This was the biggest problem
with the show: it was much too cold to be
outdoors. ‘

Moyer welcomed everyone, and then

proceeded to introduce the ﬁrst of two ‘

faux—horror trailers made by the bands.
One was the brainchild of Colonizing the
Cosmos, member Michael Savisky. It was a
throwback to the ’.5os _— a purposely over-
acted, campy little piece called “I Married
a Musician” about the horrors of being a
rocker’s wife. It got quite a few laughs from
the audience and was a great way to start
off the night.

Meeting of Important People came on
shortly after, its members dressed as Ghost-
busters. The trio played some of their more
well—known songs, like bouncy pop track
“Brittney Lane Don’t Care,” as well as some
newer ones, like an indie tune they referred
to as their “Pitchfork song” — “They gave
it 3.5 stars out of one,” joked lead singer
Josh Verbanets.

The group rounded out the set with a
surf-rock cover of the theme from “The
Munsters” and a punk cover of a song by
The Screaming Weasels. '

After abrief interim, Verbanets came up
again to introduce his trailer, “One.” It was
a hard—action short about the government
giving everyone one “free” murder and the
moral struggle of one man deciding whether
or not to use his. Though it didn’t seem to be

BOOK COLUMN

 

Comic books
more than

superheroes

Tracey Hickey
« For The Pitt News

As someone who got into comic books late, I
always felt left out when my friends discussetl
them. _

When they debated the relative merits of
different Batman storylines and pondered the
mysteries that could be concealedinAlanMoore’s
beard, I felt like I was missing out on something
awesome. .

Comics seemed to be something that, like a
greatTVshowyou didn’thear aboutuntil thethird
season, Iwas too late picking up. But it wasn’t so.
At 17, Igot into comics gradually between the end
of high school and the summer after freshman
year, and you can do it at any age.

Debate overthe distinction between “cornic§”’
and “graphic novels” is ﬁerce, but it’s also quite
unproductive. Some people believe the difference
lies inthe binding, and others applythe terms the
waylibraries wield “ﬁction” versus “literat1ire’ ’ —.
as anarbitrary standard based on someone’s idea
of artisticvalue. Mostly out of stubborrmess, Iuse
the terms interchangeably.

Thankﬁilly, eveiyoneagrees on certain units of
comic book measurement: a single “issu ’ is the
slim, staple-bound chapterthataseries publishes
monthly, while “trade paperbacks” are soft-cover
volumes containing several issues. ‘M

I eased myselfinto comics with atrio of“men”
— “Watchmen,” “Sandman” and “Y: The Last
Man.” The ﬁrsttwo have had tangible impacts on
the genre of graphic novels as a whole.

AlanMoore’s “Watchmen” examines the apoc-
alyptic consequences of the existence of real-life
superheroes and precipitatedashifttowarddarke-r
and more sophisticated comic bookplotlines. Neil
Gaiman’s “Sandman” follows the struggles of the
personif1edKingofDreams, while creatingits own
mythology and weaving beautiﬁil, multilayered
stories  it. Both works have challenged the
literary community’s hesitance to accept comics as
literature by winning awards intended for “real”
novels. “Watchmen” is the only graphic novel to
make Time’s All Time 100 Greatest Novels list,
and an issue of “Sandman” won the 1991 World
Fantasy Award for short ﬁction. ’

BrianK.Vaughan’s “Y: TheLastMan” remains
my personal favorite series. Its premise is a sud-

ALBUM REVIEW

Natalie Camacci
For The Pitt News

Flashbulb Fires

Glory

Record Label: Fiance Music

Rocks Like: Placebo, Phantom Planet,
Death Cab for Cutie

Grade: B +

«Overly emotional indie rock is nothing out

“of the ordinary in a genre that is overﬂowing
with abstract band names and lengthy song
titles you’ll never remember.

But, just when it’s beginning to seem like
emerging bands in the alternative scene are
all one in the same, an unexpected group that
proves us wrong appears.

Flashbulb Fires, a Denver-based indie-
rock group whose home—recorded ﬁrst album
catapulted them into a national tour, breaks
through the mold of the dime—a—dozen in-
die sound and forces listeners to look at the

' genre itself in a whole new light.

" Their debut LP, G/001, isa fusion of melo-
dramatic and upbeat pop rock set to an
orchestral sound of horns, trumpets and
harps alongside pulsating drum and guitar
sequences.

Songs like “Pyramid Scheme” create a

’:big band sound from a simple four—member
group by syncing horns, drum rolls, cymbals
and the pulls of a harp.

Such creative musical mixtures are paired
with cleverly abstract lyrics — “Let’s start a
pyramid scheme/ We could do it underneath

,».your sheets” —- and the compelling vocals of
Patrick McGuire, whose unique sound closely
matches that of Brian Molko of Placebo.

Band burns bright

The other tracks on the album change i,

instrumental formulasgfrom song to song,

‘ always leaving the listener wondering what

to expect next.

The eerie chime-like sounds behind a
melodramatic piano and drawn out horns
in “Rope and River” evoke a darker, morbid
feel. .

The band then does a complete 180 in
“Brunette,” which speaks of waiting for “a
girl in red to drive over me” and “bury me
alive under your soft sunligh .”

These pleasantly love—tinged lyrics are

paired with a much more poppy feel of quick
drum rolls, high—pitched horns and soft vo-
cals. '

The track “Heavy Hands” is reminiscent
of The Killers (think “Read My Mind”) with
its drawn-out vocals and intensifying drum
and guitar combination that ultimatelyllead
to a climax of intensely perfect melody.

The LP ends with “Blind Leading the
Blind,” a slow-paced song with a trippy
beat that seems to mix the sounds of Pink
Floyd and The Beatles (circa “Strawberry
Fields”).

The band synthesizes striking harmonies
with brooding lyrics and penetrating vocals
that prove their placement in a spot above
the rest.

We deﬁnitely don’t need any more piano-
driven, overly emotional indie music, and
Flashbulb Fires slashes through this stereo-
type with a vengeance, showing a whole new
side to the American indie genre.

The band’s ever-changing sound and in-
tense mixture of instruments is a refreshing
alteration that will hopefully encourage other
artists to follow in their unique footsteps. .

Kim Taylor
Little Miracle
Sounds Like: Cat Power, P] Harvey,
Kate Voegele "
Grade: B

In a year packed with music from strong
female artists, it’s no surprise that fe-
male singer-songwriters are making a
comeback. Dreamy, pretty and insight-
ful, Kim Taylor’s newest album, Little
Miracle, gives listeners some much-
needed softness.

Unlike many other recent releases
from female artists such as Taylor Swift,
Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, Kim Taylor’s
music doesn’t have that pop—heavy edge,
opting instead for an earnest sweetn’ess
that is both relaxing and refreshing
withoutbeing too sugary. A favorite on

NPR’s “World Cafe,” Taylor has the soul-
fulness of past artists such as PJ Harvey

and Chrissie Hynde but the style 'of'a

new generation of songstresses like Kate
Voegele and Regina Spektor.

Writing and recording the album in
Cincinnati, Taylor tried to capture the
diversity and ambiguity of the city and
— though her lyrics are interesting —
as a whole, Little Miracle can sound a
little repetitive at times. What makes
Taylorinteresting is her voice, which
has a raspy, jazz-like quality to it that
interests listeners in- a way her lyrics
don’t. The austere method she employs
— using only piano, acoustic guitar and
percussion — is well—suited to her voice
and allows her vocals to stand on their
own. i '

Although not groundbreaking, Kim if

Taylor’s Little Miracle is soothing and

pretty, the perfect background music for '

studying or relaxing. I

Ifyou have a strong preference for traditional
literary fare, Iwould recommend starting with a
graphic novel memoir. Craig Thompson’s “Blan-
ke ” is a moving story about ﬁrst love. Alison
Bechde ’s “Fim Home” is lyrical and rich with
insights about gender, sexuality and family. Also
under this umbrella is Art Spiegelman’srwell—
known Holocaust allegory “Maus” — though
I haven’t ‘read it, ifs one of the most universally
respected graphic novels.

When I picked my friends’ brains as a still-
inexperienced comic geek, they recommended
“Johnny the Homicidal Maniac” fromjhonen

vader Zirn.”_ I’rn told this graphic novel is exactly
what it sounds like ‘—.—. . _

To thislistladd another’ofMoore’s works. “V

Portman, envisions a dystopian future where the

recommendation from the writer is"‘League of

fascinating take on several well-known literary
ﬁgures. ' ' -

as inten-
tionally humorous as the previous trailer,
people laughed at this one as well. Despite
the audience reaction, it was a thought-pro-
voking idea and a well-executed trailer.
Colonizing the Cosmos’ set started off
with the hauntingly tragic “What Left Me
Stranded,” about a stranded astronaut on
a lifeless planet. They continued" through
with tracks like the soft, lilting “Moon
Shine Moon” and the happy, bouncy “The
Phononauts.” The band prepared to wrap
up their set with their eponymous “C the C,”

11

but suddenly broke into “We’re Off to See;
the Wizard,” a nod to their female backup
singers’ costumes of Dorothy and Glinda,
before performing the actual track. .

Finally, the two bands came together
to cover “The Time of the Season” by the
Zombies, a psychedelic-pop song, which
was the perfect cap to a wonderful night?“

All. in all, these two bands know how to
throw a great shindig, and I look forward to
going to more shows of their in the future
—-— hopefully they’ll be indoors.

'f'MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Defense and rebounding.

Those have been two of the key ingredients
in the Pitt men’s basketball program’s success
over the last decade, and it looks as if that’s
going to continue again this season.

The Panthers defeated Northwood Univer-
sity 104-62 yesterday in their exhibition opener
at the Petersen Events Center. Northwood plays

/gin the National Association of Intercollegiate 5
"Athletics (NAIA), an athletic association for

small colleges. .

Pitt out-rebounded the Seahawks 39-25 and
held them scoreless until a Tyrone Davis basket
made the score 23-2 in favor of the Panthers
with 11:31left in the ﬁrst half.

“It started on the defensive end. We really
came out strong,” junior guard Ashton Gibbs
said. “It affected our offense. We got easy transi-
tion breaks.” _

Anothertrend that looks like itwillcontinue
this season is Gibbs’ hot shooting.

Gibbs ﬁnished with 25 points on 8-of-
12 shooting including 5 for 8 from 3-point
range.

“Gibbs was terriﬁc tonight shooting the

ball,” Northwood head coach and former Vil-
lanova coaching great Rollie Massirnino said.

Three Panthers sat out with injuries — Nasir
Robinson, who will be out three to six weeks
with a knee injury, did not dress. Gil Brown and
Lamar Patterson are day-to-day with hamstring
and ankle injuries, respectively. ‘

Their absence allowed guard Travon Wood-
all and redshirt freshman forward Talib Zanna

,;.to crack the starting lineup, andthey made the

most of the opportunity.
Zanna had 13 points and nine rebounds
while Woodall had 10 points and nine assists.
“We saw the improvement in Talib last year.
Even though he redshirted we saw that he was
maybe our best rebounder on the team,” senior

‘Jguard Brad Wanamaker said. “Today he had

some open opportunities and we took advan-
tage of it.”

Wanamaker contributed 18 points and 10
assists while freshman].j. Moore had 17 points,
including three 3—pointers in his ﬁrst game in a

av-,Panthers uniform.
“[Moore] is shooting the ball well. He brings '

a lot of energy to practice and he plays hard too,”
head coachjamie Dixon said. “That’s the thing
that really attracted us to him watching him play
while recruiting him. I think that’s what’s going
to continue to help him improve.”

The Panthers will play their second exhibi-
tion game on Thursday against Indiana Uni-
versity (Pa.) before starting the regular season
Nov. 8 against Rhode Island. I

Ben‘Livingston
Staﬁ Writer

The Panthers’ 20-3 win over Louisville Satur-
day was possible not only because Pitt played
well, but also because the Cardinals made
plenty of mistakes.

Quarterback Adam Froman of Louisville
(4-4, 1-2 Big East) received praise from both
Louisville head coach Charlie Strong and Pitt
head coach Dave Wannstedt leading up to the
game, but Froman struggled to ﬁnd a rhythm
during the contest. He made a number of inac-
‘curate throws in key situations and ﬁnished
13-22 with just 82 passing yards.

5 Big East leading rusher Bilal Powell tallied
64 rushing yards on 11 carries but had to leave
the game in the third quarter due to a knee
injury. Louisville’s other backs averaged just

3.6 yards per carry in the game.

Strong couldn’t ﬁgure out what caused
Louisville’s offensive struggles.

“We just didn’t come out today,” Strong
said. “We came out with the energy, but we
just didn’t show it.”

Louisville is known for badgering opposing
defenses. Exactly 115 of the 210 points they
had scored prior to Saturday’s match-up came
during the second quarter of games. Against
Pitt, however, the Cardinals failed to put up a
single point in the second quarter for the ﬁrst
time this season.

Louisville’s meager 185 yards on offense
were primarily a product of Adam Froman’s
inability to throw the ball and P0well’s injury,
but Pitt’s defense still deserves plenty of credit
for the statistics.

Pitt defensive lineman Jabaal Sheard was
a nightmare for Froman, forcing the quarter-
back to fumble twice.

The second time, Myles Caragein recov-
ered the ball for Pitt and ran it 56 yards to the
Louisville 5—yard line,-setting up a Dion Lewis
touchdown that put the Panthers up‘20—3 on
the ﬁrst play of the fourth quarter.

' Asked in a post-game press conference
about how Sheard has responded to the off-
the-ﬁeld problems he experienced prior to
the season, Wannstedt declined to comment,

AN OLTMANNS’ OPINION

Pitt will win Big East, play in BCS bowl”

Pitt already has a big lead in the conference, and it doesn’t look like any team can catch up.

  

 

Oha Cadji 'Ass1stantVisual Editor

Myles Caragein returns a fumble in the third quarter of Saturday’s football game. It set up a Dion Lewis touchdown, and now the Panthers have control of the Big East.

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

I hate to say I told you so, and I’m sorry
for the cliche. But I told you so.

About one month ago, I wrote a column
saying how the Pitt football team, 1-2 at
the time, would bounce back in league
play and earn a BCS bowl bid by winning
the conference.

Well, now —- at 3-0 in the Big East and
already essentially two games up on the
second place teams in the conference —
the Panthers look to be in a great position
to do just that.

After completely dismantling Syracuse,
Rutgers and Louisville, Pitt looks like a
completely different team than the one
that failed to even get in the end zone
during a 31-3 loss to Miami.

Following that loss, senior defensive
endjabaal Sheard said the team had to fix
some things, and Sheard is leading that
charge toward continued improvement.

With two more sacks against the Car-
dinals, Sheard has nine for the season.

This puts him at the top of the Big East
and makes him ﬁfth in the nation in that
category, despite his consistently being
double-teamed, and sometimes even
triple-teamed.

Offensively, quarterback Tino Sunseri
seemingly has been maturing with ev-

against Louisville. V

But the improvement goes beyond just
speciﬁc players -— the whole team has
rededicated itself to winning.

And some young players have stepped
up.

cause Pitt’s going to a BCS game.

ery game, establishing himself as a team
leader g .

Dion Lewis is looking more like the
Lewis we knew last season and the offen-
sive line is much improved, this all to go
along with a defense that has been ﬂying
to the ball, giving up just three points and
185 yards of offense in Pitt’s last game

Street made a statement in Big East play
right off the bat when he caught a screen
pass on the offense’s first play and then
took it 79 yards for a touchdown against
Syracuse.

Those types of efforts have put the
Panthers atop the Big East, a league that
is weaker than usual this season and has

seen two of its more high-proﬁle teams

‘ (West Virginia and Cincinnati) suffer two

conference losses already.

With those teams both at 1-2, the only
team besides Pitt in the conference with‘;
more than one win is Syracuse, which the
Panthers easily took care of.

It doesn’t look like Pitt’s dominance
of its Big East opponents is going to stop
any time soon.

Connecticut is up next for the Panthers
and the Huskies are a team that couldn’?
even score a single point in a 26-0 loss
to Louisville.

So to put it simply, there’s no way any
team in the league is going to. catch Pitt
in the standings. .

Things are only going to get better fork
the Panthers.

All-American defensive end Greg
Romeus is set to return to the lineup '
soon, and combined with Sheard and his
backup Brandon Lindsey, who has eight
sacks, Pitt will wreak havoc on opposing
quarterbacks. ’ ‘

So get out your bowling shoes, because

asserting that Sheard’s success this season
speaks for itself. ,

“Sheard is having a phenomenal year,”
Wannstedt said. “You have to really appre-
ciate what he is going through to get to the
passer. He just keeps coming and coming. He’s
rushing the passer as good as any defensive
end in the country. He is focused every week
and working extremely hard.” ~

Pitt wasn’t as overpowering offensively as

they were against Rutgers, as the Panthers put
up 255 total offensive yards on Saturday after
posting 513 against the Scarlet Knights.

Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri racked up ‘

just 123 yards on 13-24 passing, a steep decline
from the 287 yards he had averaged in Pitt’s
previous three contests.

Louisville’s pass coverage was generally
tighter than that of Pitt’s previous three oppo-
nents. The Cardinals broke up six of Sunseri’s

passes, whereas Notre Dame, Syracuse and
Rutgers combined to break up only ﬁve.

Sunseri thinks. Pitt’s passing attack is
evolving to face new challenges.

“What we’ve been doing over the past few V

games is taking what the defense is giving us,”
Sunseri said. “A lot of teams are protecting
deep against the long ball to [Jonathan Bald-
win] or Mike Shanahan and, as a result, that’s
leaving our tight ends and our short pass game

Mike Cruz are getting open underneath and
we’ll take those completions because we’re
moving the ball and the chains.”.

Cruz has pulled in just two receptions over
the previous two weeks, but notched 28 re-
ceiving yards against Louisville — double
what he recorded in an effort against Rutgers
that earned him thejohn Mackey Tight End
of the Week award.

Hynoski left the Louisville game with a
concussion, and was replaced by Chris Mike.
The two ended up combining for three recep-
tions, equalto the numbers earned by Pitt’s
top receivers Baldwin and Shanahan. Both
were heavily covered, and four of the passes
that Louisville broke up were intended for
the ﬁillbacks.

Pitt’s rushing game put up fewer yards than

206 yards to 151 yards.
