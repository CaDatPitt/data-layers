Grads Pay Less

Starting today, gractuate stu-
dents can attend Pitt Program
(louncil events and pay the
same prices as undergraduates
do.

The new policy is the result
of an agreement reached among
PPC, the Graduate Student
Professional Association, and
the Student Government Board.

Under the agreement, gradu-
ate students will pay the same
prices as undergraduates to
attend PP(J programming. Pre-
viously. graduate students paid
the standard non—under-
_graduate prices. The GSPA

}$yelieved that the pricing was
unfair. and bargained with the
PPC and SGB to get the lower
prices. The groups will conduct
survey of how many graduate
students attend PP(I events dur-
ing that period.

Upon the results of the stir-
vey, it will be determined how
much graduate students should
contribute to PPC pro-
gramming.

Payment Plans

Ifor students who find that
money's tight when it comes to
pay their tuition l)il], Pitt’s
Office of student loans and spe-
vcial accounts has a solution . .

A _£;E‘he deferred tuition payment
plan allows for students to pay
tuition over a period of three
months. In order to be eligible
for this program, a student need
only carry three credits and be
in good academic standing at
Pitt. Currently, there are 4500
students involved in the
program.

For more information, con-
tact the office of student loans
and special accounts in Mervisi

Adopts
Funding
Policies

By LAURIE MCICLEOD

New policies on questionable
areas of funding were approved by
the Student Government Board at
Friday's meeting. '

The policies contain guidelines
for funding advertising, SGB con-
certs and other programming,
food, athletics, travel‘ and recruit-
ment. Funding priorities and items
not funded by SGB are also listed.

“If a question arises, these new
policies will supercede the first
policy adopted at the beginning of
the term," said SGB President
Todd DeLuca.

A new food policy, with an
amendment to the former policy of
not funding food for any organiza-
tion, was accepted by the board.

The first amendment introduced
at the meeting included an excep-
tion to the food policy for SGB
only, but several board members

felt it discriminated against other
groups.

Allocations Committee Chair-
man Bob Colosimo said SGB

. would be justified because other
groups can raise money for food,
while SGB cannot. '

A different proposal, which
ammended the food policy by mak- ‘I
ing an exception for SGB to gain
full funding for two functions
only—the Inauguration Dinner
and Student Recognition Dinner-—
was accepted by the board.

“These policies are guidelines to
making decisions, but not laws‘
that can‘t be deemed right or left,”
DeLuca said.

A SGB restructured the Resident
Student Associations’ budget for
the “Spring Fling”, after two
weeks of rejecting the Allocations
Committee recommendations to

fund only 40 percent of the event-
SGB will fund various recrea-
tional items 100 percent, but fund

Progressive Group

Plans For Diversity 

By SCOTT REX
While most Pitt students were
spending last Thursday night at
\ the Oakland bars, others were gath-
ering to discuss how sttttlenls can
’ light budget (tits in student aid.

.-\bout 23 students met for the
first meeting of the Progressive
Student r\'etworl< (I’S.\') a newly
formed campus group that spent
the last several weeks collecting
sigttatittes for petitions opposing
the protesting the aid cuts.

".-\n\time you have a first meet-
ing and over 20 students show up
on a Ilitirstlav night. which is usu-
allv devoted to drinking beer.
you've accomplished what a lot of
groups on this campus have failed
.o do," Dana Reed. newly elected
PSN co—executi\‘<‘ chairman.

Kevin Dami. chairman of (Lol-
lege Young Democrats and PSN
co-chairman said the PSN has
“strong possil)ilites for appealing
to a large population of this uni-

\'ers'ity's students."

"We won't settle for fifty stu-
dents, or that matter for a hundred
students," Danvi said ‘ We feel
that bv concentrating on the
budget (ms to students we can pol-
iticallv awake those that have been
asleep way too long.

The group will also focus on
other issues in addition to student
aid cuts. In its tonstitution. PSN
states that it hopes to raise the gen-
eral level of political consciousness
in the student body. The group
plans to meet weekly to discuss a
variety of issues. PSN hopes that
the tIi\'t‘t‘sit\ of the issues discussed
will attract interest from students.

")'Tlie majority of groups on this
campus are one-issue groups.
which makes it virtually impossi-
ble for them to reach out to a broad
spectrum of the student popula-
tion," Reed said. “The PSN will
deal with issues that range from the

Enrollment: Engineering
Full, GAS, Others Open

By DINA LARDAS

Pitt accepts approximately 2,500
students annually into its tinder-
graduate schools of engineering,
nursing and College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS), and currently most

of the openings in the engineering’ ‘

school are filled, with the nursing
and CAS programs about half
filled.

When asked how student aid cuts
will effect enrollment, Joseph
Merante, Director of Office of'Stu-
dent Admissions, explained that
there is . an “unusual pheno-
menon” occuring at Pitt.

Nationally, fewer students are
going to college, —but those contin-
uing their secondary education are
being very selective, according to
Merante. He said students are send-
ing applications to many schools
and are choosing the insititutions
promising "the best curriculum
with the best aid package. He said
he believes Pitt is in a good situa-
tion right now because it can offer
both;

Merante also said that Pitt has ..

had an increase in the number of
students putting down their initial
deposits to attend the University.

The curriculum change in CA3
should also help with recruitment.
Tougher requirements will,
according to Merante, lure the
serious students to Pitt. According
to Merante, no extra recruiting
really needs to be done to increase
prospective student interests in the
university, despite the increasing
possibility of student aid cutbacks
and declining enrollments.

    

Although budget cutswill even-
tually affect both students and the
university on a whole, it is pre-
dicted that there will be no drop in
enrollment for the fall term.
Merante said he believes Pitt is in a
strong position because it offers a
good academic programiand stu-
dent aid deals. .

Pitt is again participating in the
annual College Fair being held at
the Convention Center today and
Tuesday. Some 8-10,000 students
are expected to attend.

 Profile: Darla Griffiths, WPGH General Manager

l.

“There's definitely a future in
the radii) field, but you have to go
out and make your own advance-
ment,” said Darla Griffiths, gen-
eral manager of Pitt's student radio
station, WPGH. “The opportuni-
ties don't come knocking; you ‘have
to go out and prove yourself."

Proving one's self in the radio
field is exactly what the. junior
speech and communications major
is doing as WPGH’s first female
general manager.

“A friend talked me into apply-
ing for the position—a position I
seriously didn’t think I had a
chance of getting,” said Griffiths,
who first started with the station a
year ago as a newscaster. “But the
more we talked, I realized that with
the ideas I had, coupled with the
general manager position. I could
change a radio station that wasn't
going anywhere."

ing new programs and
motional campaigns for WPGH.

program Saturday
designed to appeal to the black

Griffiths, who assumed her posi-
tion in December, puts in some 20
hours a week at WPGH tending to
duties that include choosing and
working closely with the station’s
13 student program directors, man-
aging a $23,000 budget, and initiat-
pro-

“()ne of my goals as general
manager is to get the station better
known by advertising in more pub-
lications, and sponsoring PR con-
tests,” she said. “We started a funk
imornings

audience and we'll be announcing

plans for a contest to name our’

mascot who will be intiated at
freshmen orientation in August."

Plans for WPGH also include
introducing two new programs-—a
Spanish show and a “psych talk"
show in efforts to “appeal to as
many different types of student as
possible."

In the radio world, where an
iden_tifiable image becomes essen-
tial for a station's survival, Grif-
fiths said she believes WPGH
would be greatly enhanced if it
switched from its present spot of_6-if
on the AM dial to one on the FM
frequency.

“I'd describe WPGH as a melo-
rock station that goes beyond the
top -10 and gives air time to artists
that aren't as well-known," she
explained. “Some of our identity
problems would be solved if we had
a slot on the FM frequency. Most
students don't switch over to AM."

The station‘s problem of not
being known has. at times, led to
another problem-—not being taken
seriously—as Griffiths learned
firsthand.

“I remember a live broadcast we
did from the Towers lobl)y——it was
a nightmare! Most of the football
players who agreed to be inter-
viewed ‘didn't show up and we had
to interview two second string
players for an hour and an half,”
she said, adding that she thought
the reason they didn’t show-up was

because they didn't feel obligated
to a station they knew little about
or listened to. "I learned my lesson
about being prepared and realized
that if WPGH was to be taken
seriously we had to develop a
stronger audience on campus."

Developing a larger WPGHA
audience and attending classes‘
aren't the only things occuppying
the general manager who says she
admires jill (Iummings of 3WS
radio station because of the “fan-
tastic public relations job" she did
in taking the station from the
unknown status to one of three top
stations in Pittsburgh. Griffiths
also waitresses at My Place restau-
rant in Oakland and teaches a
weekly gymnastics “dance class.

“I’ve taken dancing lessons in
ballet, tap, point and jazz and have
been at it for 18 years," she said.
.“But I knew it was something I
couldn’t go to college for, so I
decided on speech and corn-
munications."

Griffiths won't be handing up
her tap shoes or her promotional
ideas in the future. She plans to
pursue a PR/advertising job in the
radio field after graduation. For the
time being, however, Griffiths’
sights are set on WPGH.

"I want it to be the best it can be
and that includes making it as well
known on campus as possible,” she
said, “and moving back upstairs
after the renovation in ohe pie‘ce.”

only 40 percent of food for the RSA
function.

The Allocations Committee
recommendation to fund 40 per-
cent of the Interhonorary Council’s
pizza party and “take a professor to
lunch" programs as social events,
which was proposed at last week’s
meeting was reintroduced at Fri-
day's meeting. ‘ ’

Although II-IC members said
they feel the programs are educa-
tional and should be funded 100
percent, Colosimo did not agree.

“The two programs are social

with educational portions, but the
bulk is social," Colosimo said.

SGB, however, sided with the
IHC, agreeing that the programs
were for educational and recruit-
ment purposes and rejected the
Allocations Committee’s recom~
mendation.

DeLuca broke a 3-3 tie by voting

“yes” to a proposal to fund an.

Inter-fraternity Council full-page
ad, previous_ly paid for from the
_IFC’s private account.

Board member ‘Linda
O’Connner disagreed with the

decision saying that the SGB had
already done its part.

“To pay $l8l.00 for an addi-
tional ad for an already popular
event is irresponsible of the board,"
she said.

In other business SGB endorsed
a 3500-signaturepetition concern-
ing federal budget cuts, presented
by the Progressive Student
Network.

A Student Health survey, pres-
ented by the Student Health Service
subcommittee of SGB was also
endorsed. 1

Phi Groove, a service organiza-
tion dedicating time to community
and charity work, received SGB's
approval for partial recognition .

Board member Chip Roth told
those present at the meeting that
Student Health Service chairman
Franklyn Carter has announced a
43 percent increase in the student
health fee which will take effect in
the fall. According to Roth the fee
will increase from $21 to $30
because of a 10 percent increase in

staff salary and lab contracts, mail- '

ing and printing services.
Roth said the budget also calls

for a $180,000 surplus, s42,00_ 

more than last year.

“In light of other increases stu-

dents will be facing, we will look at
the proposed increase seriously and
try to effect a change in a way to
bring down the total," Roth said.
DeLuca and Roth are in
Washington, D.C. for the second
annual National Student Lobby
Day.
"DeLuca said when they receive
the impact reports and facts regard-

ing exact budget cut effects, they‘

will lay down concrete plans for
letter and telephone campaigns.

Acronyms, those necessities of the bureaucratic society
in which we live, often times take on representative mean-
ings for the organizations for which they stand. GASP, or
the Group Against Smog and Pollution, comes readily to
mind. How about this one: SCUD, the State College and
University Directors.

Although it may not have anything to do with the
organization, SCUD is an appropriate verb for what hap-
pened the other day when the directors were rebuffed in
their recommendation that tuition at state colleges and
universities be hiked $75 a semester from $625. The hike
was intended to cover part of a $6.3 million court-ordered
salary increase for members of the Association of Pennsyl-
vania State College and University Faculties. SCUD really
scudded the wrong way on that one.

It should be pointed out that Pitt, as a state-related
university, would not have been affected by the increase.
Nevertheless, there are some important issues that extend
beyond definitional boundaries which should be
addressed. i

The tuition hike had been approved by a 5-3 vote at the
Jan.  1982 meeting of the SCUD board, and was sup-
posed to provide $5.7 million of the $6.3 million retroac-
tive salary increase for the state college faculty members.
Although the Thornburgh administration had attempted
to prevent tl1e 4.5 percent pay increase, awarded in 1977 by
an arbitrator, the administration was rebuffed by a state
Supreme (Iourt decision last November upholding-the

. \

So, with the combined brilliance of the state Depart-
ment of Education and SCUD, it was decided that the best
thing to do was‘ tack on an extra $75 on the state students’
tuition, which would take effect March 1.

Well, the'i»dea worked fine, albeit with some of the usual
grumbling from the Commonwealth Association of Stu-
dents, until it came time for the SCUD board to vote on the
recommendation. The board is supposed to have 13

members, although there are currently two vacancies.
()nly six members appeared at the Jan. 13 meeting, so to
get the necessary quorum, two members were contacted by
phone for their votes. That’s when the troubles started.

The (Iommonwealth Association of Students filed a
class-action “suit on behalf of the .76,000 state students,
challenging the tuition increase on the basis of a lack of a
legal quorum at the meeting during which the increase
was approved.

judge David Craig, who issued the temporary injunc-
tion barring the tuition hike, went along with the associa-
tion’s argument that the meeting was a violation of the
state’s Sunshine Law, which requires that final decisions
made by any government body be made in public and with
advanced notice. The suit contended that the remaining.
members of the board who didn’t make it to the meeting
and whom were not contacted by phone were denied equal
opportunity to participate in the d_e£ision. ‘

One comiiientator suggested that what was at stake was
not the money, but instead it was a question of failing to
follow procedures on the part of SCUD and the education
department.

That's part of the argument. By any measure, SCUD’s
action was a direct and obvious violation of state laws
governing such procedures, and both SCUD and the'edu-
cation department were properly penalized. -

T be whole tuition hi-ke, however, also raises the ques-
tion of whether college students -today should be held
liable for mistakes made in the past-—in most cases, even
before they attended the universities now forcing the V

‘increases on them. ‘

But the most important thing to learn from all of this is
that you can't operate a bureaucracy without following,
bureaucratic rules and regulations. The state ‘colleges
could have had their money today had the administrators
only been a little more aware of what was happening at -
that fateful Jan. I3 meeting. In the future, we would hope
that both the state college presidents and the education

' department be more vigilant when it comes to monitoring

While most. Americans spend
time discussing whether or not the
demonstration effect will one day
rea_ch Mexicci, the pipeline that
will supply up to l,400 billion
cubic feet of natural gas a year from
the Soviet Union to Western
Europe receives little attention.

lt’s been almost 60 years since
Germany and the Soviet Union
signed the Treaty of Rapallo. This
treaty enabled the German army to
rearm after World War I. It appears
to me that these two countries
haven't learned their lesson. Once
again, they have begun to use each
other for their own advantages.
The only difference between today
and yesterday is that then the Soviet
Union helped to rearm Germany;

today they want to help reunify 

East and West Germany.
President Reagan tried unsuc-
cessfully to stop the building of
this pipeline, but evidently he
didn’t try hard enough. I do not-
consider myself part of the conser-
vative camp. But there are histori-
cal situations of which we must

I remain clear. I cannot see the day

when the Soviet Union would per-
mit a freeand unified Germany to
border Poland. Obviously, the pol-
itical left in West Germany
disagrees.

Soviet Union and Western Europe
should realize they may be upset-
ting the equilibrium that helps us
to avoid major conflicts. They also
need to be reminded of a few histor-
ical facts.

They should remember 1956,
when Soviet jeeps roamed the
streets of Budapestgwith portable
gallows, seeking out counter-
revolutionaries. They should
remember 1968,. when the Soviet
Union applied cosmetic surgery to
Dubcek"s “socialism with a face."
They should also look at General

asked question: “would Polish
soliders fire on Polish citizens?”

What will happen in 10 years if‘;

Gerrnany is unified and one day the
West Germans decide that life was
better the old way? Will East.Ger~

If in 10 years the Soviet Union

if in 10 years the United States is
still following its insane crisis-

we might be asking ourselves this

lt’s Pitt-Duquesne Again

isy AMIN GHOSSEIN

The topic of conversation in the

bustling Pitt locker room was not
the 79-70 defeat of George
Washington that hadjust taken
place minutes earlier but the
Panthers’ opponent in the opening
round of the Eastern 8 tournament
tomorrow night.
, By the virtue of their win over
GW--or is it by their mis-
fo'rtune?—the Panthers will take
on, undoubtedly before a sellout
crowd, none other than seething
rival Duquesne.

Duquesne is ll-I5. their inept-

ness is exceeded only by their lack’

of cohesion. Rarely have two
games featured the same Duke
lineup. Their coach, Mike Rice, in
‘the midstiof his worst season. has
‘rumors of his dismissal swirling
about him. Their star player, Bruce
Atkins, has at times been found to
be sleepwalking during games.

But, of all the opponents Pitt
could have faced, Duquesne is the
one they desparately didn’t want to
meet. Especially not in the first
round.

“It’s going to be a very tough
game. If we look at records, then
we’l'l lose. When we play, records
don’t count,” Pitt’s Clyde

. Vaughan said in summing up the
V Pitt-Duquesne contest.

Might as well call itTHE GAME
in Pittsburgh. No matter the
records or quality of one team,
THE GAME almost invariably
hinges on doubt until the final
buzzer. It’s almost never a blowout,
and it is definitely never easy.

"It’s going to get physical.
They’ll be fired up.” Pitt center
Andre Williams said.“ It's not the
kind of game you want to play in
the first round, but we'll be ready.”

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Ah, but do statistics lie. How
they have lied for the West Virginia
-Mountaineers. Why, these statistics
have even clouded the ‘minds of
pollsters. They’ve ranked the
Mountaineers as high as sixth in
the country.

Sure, a team with a 24-2 record
deserves some respect, but the ques-
tioniis, how much? How much
respect can you give a team that has
St. Leo, Stetson and Youngstown
State padding its winning streak?

Not much. here. Don't get me
wrong. West Virginia is a good has-

erupted. That’s not .physical—
that’s a little hatred and a lotof will
tqwin. If you were to give the
matchup a slogan, “Never give an
inch” might be appropriate.

“It doesn’t matter who we play.
Since it's Duquesne it'll be intense.
We’ll go after them, I know I will,”
said Pitt’s Darrell‘ Gissendanner,
whose wrestling match with
Duquesne’s Andy Sissini started
the brawl at the Arena. “I won’t be
thinking about the fight, but I’ll
protect myself if I have to."

As if the natural rivalry weren’t
enough, the name calling just adds
to the emotion, to the crowd, to the
game.

“Typical Pitt” was how Sissini
described his fight with
Gissendanner. ,

“If Lloyd Moore goes to
Duquesne, he’ll be Bruce Atkins
surrounded by mediocrity,” said‘

’ Pitt assistant coach Seth Green-

berg. The comment will surely be
remembered—plastered on every
locker and bulletin board on the
Bluff is more like it.

Although Greenberg’s comment

Panther senior point guard Dwayne Wallace has returned to

may well have been “an uiispdken
truism," as Pitt head coach Roy
Chiprnaii said, the fact is that
Duquesne players never play in a
mediocre fashion against Pitt.

“Their kids just love to play
against us. They’re not a quick
team, but when we try to up the
tempo against them, they love it,”
said Cliipman, with more thanjust
a hint of anguish in his voice.

The second—year coach, whose
Pitt team finished at l7-9, it’s best
record since 1974, had to love the
way Pitt ‘disposed of George
Washington. They beat the
Colonials, a team that shot  per-
cent from the floor, by nine points.
They did it by turning over the ball
only seven times.

“It's tournament time’a”nd we're
ready. We’re peaking at the right
time,” said Gissendanner, who had
another brilliant game off
bench, speeding his way to 18'
points. .

The game may have been Pitt’s
best of the season. The statistics
might not say so, but the perfor-

winner should be. The team
has had one of the finest seasons
of any team in the nation and
has won so often, it has almost
become routine. But winning
this year’s tournament will be
anything btit routine. It won't

the defending 150-pound cham-
pion, Tom Fiornanti of Blooms-
burg State to capture first place,
while sophomore 158-pounder'Jeff
Jelic won a 5-2 decision against
Penn State’s freshman star Eric
Brugel, to qualify for the NCAA
"National Tournament.

Sophomore Joe Throckmorton
(126 pounds) and freshman heavy-
weight Dennis Atiyeh came back in
the consolations round to place
third, while sophomore 177-
pounder Frank Rich took a fourth
place.

ln_.the quarter finals, Pitt’s fresh-
man’ Rick Esswein ran into trouble
when he came up against the even-
tual 118 pound champion Carl
DeStefanis, and fell to a 3:23 pin.
. At 126 pounds, Throckmorton
made short work of Cleveland's
Jerry Urry, scoring" a 2:26 first-
period pin, while Craig Richey of

. Pitt handled Clarion’s Bill Arnold,

At 142 pounds, Clarion’s Ken
Nellis decisioned Pitt’s Jeff Gor-
don 5-0, while at 150 pounds,
Haines won his first E.W.L. tour-
nament match by beating Lock
Haven’s Wade Potter l4-7.

Jeff Jelic started his quest for the
championship at 158 pounds by
sneaking past Bloomsburg’s Gregg
Sullivan, 8-5. . "

At 167, Pepe Harris of _Pitt

Senior guard Debbie Lewis ended her playing

dropped his first match of the even-
ing to Bloomsburg’s Tom Gibble
on a third-period pin, while at 177
pounds, Rich of Pitt scored a 7-6
decision over West Virginia’s
Wilber Wolf.

weight Atiyeh drew a bye into the
semi-finals to close the first round.

In the semifinals, at 126 pounds,
Throckmorton gave up a last-
minute takedown to Lock Haven’s
Mike Millward to lose the 4-3 deci-
sion, and Penn State’s Bill Marino
worked" over Richey 19-0 at 134
pounds

At 150 pounds, Haines assured
his trip to Nationals by beating
Clarion’s Scott Glass, 8-3, with
Jelic following suit by major-
decisioning Clarion’s Rob Albeit
11-1 in overtime.

At 177, Rich's efforts were
stopped by Clarion’s All-America
Charlie Heller in 1:49, while at
heavyweight, Clarion’s Curt Olson
averaged an earlier loss to Atiyeh
by whipping the freshman, 17-3.

Haines, who took the only los-
ing record into the finals (6-7-2)
came back after a 2-0 deficit to
head-lock Bloomsburg’s Tom F io-
vanti to his back in 2:07. The last
time the two met in dual-meet com-
petition, Fiovanti beat Haines 9-6.
Fiovanti also won the 150 pound
crown last year by defeating Pitt’s
Mike Bond, who was out with an
injury for this year’s tournament.

At 158 pounds, Jelic beat Penn
State’s Brugel for the second time
this season, by a 5-2 margin, boost-
ing Jelic’s record to 18-2-1.

The season came to a disap-
pointing close for the Pitt Lady
Panther basketball team Saturday

as it dropped its sixth-straight

game to the Top 10-ranked Lady
Knights of Rutgers, 95-64. With the
loss, Pitt ends the season at the .500
mark 14-14.

Rutgers was quick to answer,
though, with 17 points to Pitt’s

waur, taking the score to 17-6 just
i

ve minutes into the contest. The
Lady "Panthers could only pull
within six points before Rutgers
went on another brief scoring surge
that opened a 15-point gap at 30-
15. Pitt was able to come within
nine by halftime, with the score
being 38-29.

With senior point guard Debbie
Lewis on the bench with four per-
sonal fouls, Coach Judy Saurer

men Renee Roma and Becky Mazi-

the first half. The 6-3 center also
grabbed a team-high (12 rebounds.
Lewis also added 12 points, but it
simply wasn’t enough.

Lewis closes her career as the
Lady Panthers’ all-time leading
scorer with 1,941 points. She also
holds the game, season and career
records in steals and assists.

Aughburns takes over fourth
place on the scoring list with 967
career points. She also holds the
record for most blocked shots in a
career with 241.

Carol Dugan moved into ninth
position on the Lady Panther scor-
ing list, despite playing only seven
games her sophomore year due to»
injury. Simply returning from her
knee injury was evidence of
Dugan's determination. Coming
back to finish her career averaging
10 points a game attests to the tal-
ent of the Willowick. Ohio native.

Finally, Beth Tarasi, a transfer
from Edinboro State College, ends
her short career at Pitt. While here
she was counted on and called
upon to spell the starting guattls.
Tarasi did this with an intensity
and ability searched for by all
coaches. All four players will be
sorely missed by the Lady Panthers

his hopes alive by decisioning Mil-
lersville’s Dave Pierce 7-4, but
Pitt’s Vulcano was booted out of
the running by Lock Havens’s Bob
DePonte, 5-0, at 190 pounds.

In the second round of the conso-

closer to third place by downing
Clarion’s Kraig Nellis, 10-5, and
Don Parsley of Lock Haven came
back to pin Richey in 4:36, at 134

What promises to be the fastest
men’s Eastern NCAA Regional
Swimming Championships in his-
tory will begin Thursday at Pitt’s
Trees Hall Pool. The meet will
draw over 15 teams in the East for
three days of swimming in which
almost all of the Eastern records are
expected to be reestablished.

It will be a fast meet due to this
season's quality of sprinters

’ throughout the East. Pitt, West

Virginia, Maryland and Cleveland
State boast the strongest sprinters.
The daily sprint freestyle events-
the 50-yard event on Thursday, the
200-yard race on Friday and the
100-yard event on Saturday—wi11
be Pitt’s strong points. The Pan-
thers have qualified eight sprint-
freestylers for Easterns. This
power, coupled with a Pitt crowd
and the fierce competition, should
put several Panther freestylers into
the NCAA National Champion-
ships held March 25-27 in
Milwaukee.

The first event of the 1982 East-
erns will be the 500-yard freestyle.
Pitt’s Greg Pelton, a senior, is the
fastest returning 500-man from last
year. His end-of-season strength is
usually ‘underestimated and he
should offer a good race for the
strong West Virginia and Mary-
land freestylers. ,

Pitt freshman Greg Murphy has
swum this event all season for Pitt
and is expected to make the top
eight for championship finals,
thus scoring valuable Pitt points in
an otherwise weak event, in which
Pitt enters only two-swimmers.

The 200-yard individual medley
is next, with Cleveland State fresh-
man and Brazilian Olympian, Rui
Abrau, seeded first. But Pitt’s
Sandy Pidgeorkis right behind and
Pidgeon has not lost this event all
S(’2lS()ll.

The Eastern record should be
beaten by both men as they try to
cut two seconds off their times to
get into Nationals. Three others
from Pitt, all freshmen, should
score some more valuable points.
For rookies Ed Bergan, Doug Con-
don, and Tim Brewer, it will be
their first Easternevent ever.

Pitt’s Doug Haines, along with teammate Jeff Jelic, will
represent Pitt at the upcoming NCAA National Champion-

ships next weekend at Iowa State.

place finish, followed by Blooms-
burg with 72.25 points and Clarion
with 46.25 points. Lock Haven,
Cleveland State and Millersville
followed Pitt.

The coaches’ wild card selections
for the two wrestlerswho will go to
national along with the top two
wrestlers at each weight, are Doug
Buckwalter (29-6) of Lock Haven
and Tom Gibble (21-6-1) of
Bloomsburg.

Other highlights of the tourney
were John Hanrahan, (167) and
heavyweight Steve Sefter of Penn
State, who won their second
E.W.L. crowns, and Charlie Heller
of Clarion, who won his third title
in a row. The outstanding wrestler

«Records Not Safe at

Greg Pelton

The third event is the fastest
event of Easterns, the 50-yard free-
style. West Virginia, Pitt and Mary-

land swimmers should all break

the old Eastern record of 20.80. Pitt
has seven men in this event, all of
whom should score points.

Senior Rick Carter, last year's
winner, and freshman Ed LaNoue,
are the heavy favorites from Pitt to
win. Head Coach Fred Lewis has
been preparing all season for East-
erns and Nationals, and this is
Pitt’s first event to show how well
the end-of—season taper and home
pool will help Pitt.

The national qualifying time of
20.39 seconds is the fastest qualify-
ing time the East has ever seen.
More than one swimmer from this
event will undoubtedly beat it. Pete
Doyle, Jerry Zaleski, J.D. McCril-
lis, Jon Quinn, and Eric Blamick
are all top Eastern sprinters and all
should tally points for Pitt, as plac-
es one through 16 are scored.

The 40-0‘-yard medley relay is the
last event Thursday. Pitt is cur-
rently seeded first and with the
team of Bergen, Pidgeon, Geoff
Emore, and Carter, the Panthers
will shoot for Nationals. Coach
Lewis has confidence in all three of
his relays to qualify for Nationals.
This will be a good note for Pitt to
end the first day of Eastern
competition.

Reese as he won a record-setting
fourth E.W.L. title.

Todd Cummings (118) and Tom
Fiovanti of Bloomsburg both
dropped their E.W.L. titles as did
Mark Downing of Clarion, who
was shooting for his third in a row.

_ Haines and Jelic will now pre-
pare for the NCAA National Tour-
nament at Iowa State University to
be held March 11-13. It is the first
time since 1979, when Glenn Max-
well won the 118 title, that Pitt has
managed to send an Eastern cham-
pion to the national contest, and
the first time since 1977 that Pitt
has had two champions.

yard individual medley. Returning
champion Sandy Pidgeon is highly
favored again this year, with senior
teammate Pelton right behind.
Pidgeon will attempt to break the

Eastern record he set last year, as")

well as try for national qualifica-
tion. This is one of Easterns hard-
est events to swim, and will say a lot
for the team and respective coach
that wins. Pitt freshman Dean
Delibertis is also entered. He

should make consolation finals

and score Pitt some needed points.

Pitt will do well in the 100-yard
backstroke with Freshmen Bergan
and Brewer. Emore and Doyle will
be close behind. Bergan. top-
ranked going into the meet, should
crush the Eastern record as he

shoots to qualify for Nationals

with a time of 51.48 or better.

Friday’s last event should be a
certain record setter. The 800-yard
freestyle relay, where each
swimmer swims eight lengths, will
be faster than ever for Pitt. Only
one member of the relay that
almost set a record last year doesn't
return this year. Scott Shearer has
graduated from Pitt, but LaNoue

" and Greg Murphy have replaced

his freestyle’ power. Pitt’s relay
should end the second day of swim-
ming with a Division I National
time that will make all the Pan-
thers sleep easier—and all the com-
petition rest _a_ little harder. ’ _

SaturdaTy has seven events'lett in
Eastern competition. The 66-lap
(1,650 yards) event will hurt Pitt,
which placed only three entries.
Pitt does enter a, surprisingly
strong freshman in Murphy, who
has come a long way in only one
year with Pitt.

But even if Murphy does place
well, the competition has depth
that will probably outscore Pitt;
thus, the 100-yard freestyle may be
the deciding factor in the meet. Pitt
will have seven swimmers entered,
including Carter, the returning
champion.

‘ Although Cleveland State and
WVU are seeded ahead of Pitt now,
Saturday afternoon's preliminaries
will do the necessary shuffling to
get the correct seeding. Pitt is very

Lose to WV

By BRIAN BALK

A combinatio-.5 of an improved
Mountaineer gymnastics team and
“questionable judging" led’to a
Pitt Lady Panther loss Saturday at
West Virginia University.

West Virginia won the tri-meet
with a respectable score of M10,
followed by Pitt with 138.85
points. The Universityof North
Carolina finished in third-place
with a score of l29.2.

“Overall. we really had a good
meet. Our objective was to minim-
ize the mistakes, which we did by
only having three falls throughout
the meet,” said Pitt Coach Donna
Sanft.

Pitt's consistent vault team.
which again displayed excellent
form, was led by sophomore Karen
Martin, who posted a sparkling
first-place score of 9.2. Following
behind Martin were senior Holly
Martino in third-place with a 8.95
and senior Debbie Wartenburg
with her season's best score of 8.2.

The Lady Panthers also excelled
on the uneven bars. -

. “The bar team, with only one
fall, did the best they have done all
season,” said Sanft. Once again,
Martin led Pitt with a second-place
score of 9.2. She was followed by
senior Roxanne Evans, who scored
a 9.0 and Lisa Shirk, who returned _
to the lineup to post a fine score of
9.1.

Trailing by a mere three-tenths ’
of a point, the Lady Pantherrs rose
to the moment with six well-
executed floor exercise routines.

best routines of the year,‘tur‘ned in a

ahead of Martino, in third. J
Shirk, still recuperating from
her ankle ailments, performed her
first floor routine in over a month
and madeit look as though she has
been competing all season. How-
ever, once again, ‘ the judge's
scores—8.5—did not reflect her
fine performance. The Pitt team
was especially displeased with the
higherscoring of WV U’s consider-
ably less difficult routines.
“Going into the beam the girls
knew they had to hit. They did
their best routines ever under the
pressure they were in,” Sanft said.
Although Martin’s routine was
marred by a fall, her 8.7 score was
good enough to give her a second-
place tie with teammate Martino.

end of the meet—-Pitt,WVI_l, Penn

Pitt has stuck to a strategy all
season of peaking for Easterns—an
approach that has won them six
consecutive Eastern titles.
Although their depth may cause
them to lose this year, the times Pitt
turns in should still be top-notch.
Coach Lewis stuck to his plan of
waiting until just before Easterns
to taper practice distances. Penn

Vaulting was Pitt's strongest
event in the meet, as everybody
scored at least a nine. Krat/. took
first place with a 9.7 and Smith and

scores of 9;}. Chris Femiani took
third with 219.3.

D'.»\mico said he thought Pitt

You can count on Coach
Gale Catlett to play l() or more

A players a lot every game. This

strategy has allowed him to
build depth and keep morale
high during this outstanding
season. This is one of the most
unselfish and disciplined teams
you will see in college basket-
ball anywhere in- the nation.
W\t'L'* features one or two great
players, and a lot of good, solid
and intelligent ones who all
mesh together into a winning
unit. ‘

Another reason‘ WVU will
win the tournziment is that it is
so adaptable to the type of team
it is playing. If you want to run
and gun, the Mountaineers can
do it. Should you try tohold the
ball on them,’ they are poised
enough and so fundamentally
sound,‘they can outplay you at
that game. If you choose to
bang bodies with them, they
can match you elbow for elbow
and then some. And finally,
should the opposition just play
their five against the Moun-

taineers’ five, WVU not only .

will enjoy the challenge, but
outplay them. , «

In short, this team is put
together extremely well and
with an eye toward some
greener NCAA pastures as
March winds down. The ingre-
dients are certainly all there and
it's packaged well. __

Some people may disagree
but, despite having an NCAA '

Pl/V,VU  Cream of Crop

bid resting comfortably in its

hip pocket, this team wants to .

win the Eastern 8 tournament.
The Mountaineers have tra-
veled to the Civic Arena many
times, but have never taken the
title home. What better way to
cap what has been a storybook
season in the _school’s history
than by winning the Eastern 8
the last year before arch rival
Pitt vacates the league for the
more prestigious Big East. A
kind of going away present for
Pitt.

That leads to the final reason
the Mountaineers will win it-—
Coach Gale Catlett. When he

'came-back to his alma mater,

the program was in a holding

pattern, In four years he has had»

them sitting as high as the sixth
spot in the nation. Catlett’s
ability to recruit has never been
questioned. Now he has deve-
loped into a fine bench coach.

‘Catlett’s team is firmly under
his reign——his players respond
to him like the Rittsburg“hSym-
phony to Andre Previn. This is
a team firmly in harmony with
its coach.- Some people perceive
Gale Catlett as arrogant, which
at times he is. But nobody can
question his hard work and
ability to get the job done.

Catlett certainly exceeded
expectations at West Virginia.—-
and. he has done a terrific job.
'I:,he success will continue, and
this year will include the I982

‘astern 8 tournament title.

choice, but the fact that they play
Duq uesne the first round, and most
likely Rutgers in the second, makes
it tough to chose the Panthers.
Right now, Pitt is as good as any-
body in the Eastern 8, but their
draw is a murderous one.

Getting up for Duquesne,
Rutgers and West Virginia is
nearly impossible. All three games
are both very physical and

. draining.

Not that Pitt can't make it to ihe
finals, it's just that the odds are

against it. Speaking of odds, here

are mine for the tournament:
Rutgers 3-1, West Virginia 5- l, Pitt
8-l,.t George Washington 12)-l, St.
Bonaventure 16-], "1-’hode Island
18-], Duquesne 25-1 and Massa-
chussetts 30-l.

My pick to win the tourney is
Rutgers.- They have the big man in

mance did. The Panthers’ offense
flowed, blind passes were hitting
their targets, good, smart shots
were taken.

Dwayne Wallace, whose play
five weeks ago was getting

thunderous boos from the stands, A

has. jelled the offense. Remember
last year when the senior point
guard could. seemingly at any time
in a game, take control? Well, that

form has apparently returned.

Roy Hinson, and enough quick- '

ness to beat West Virginia. Pitt
would have been the choice if not
for the draw. But if Rutgers gets
upset by Rhode Island, then Pitt
will win it. ’

“Dwayne is playing‘ with a lot’

more confidence. He's not leaving
his feet so much and he’s shooting
the ball well.”_ Chipman said.

“I’m looking to shoot more now.
Before I was concentrating on dish-
ing off, but right now if the shot is
there,.I’m taking it.” Wallace said.

A rejuvenated Wallace, an
offense that is proving more potent
with every game and Vaughan,
who missed winning the Eastern 8
scoring title by ‘one three-point
play, has Pitt going into the East-
ern 8 tournament as one of the
favorites. 

If only the Duquesne Dukes
believed that.
