Possible curtailment of Pitt’s
graduate programs during the third
school term, effective Spring term
of next year, was a topic of
discussion at Friday’s Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Graduate student
organization (FAS-GSO) meeting.

The prospect of such a closure
was announced at an earlier
Graduate School Council meeting
by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Jerome Rosenberg.
According to GSO member Gail
McGloin, the move is being
considered to ease the pressure of
Pitt’s budgetary problems.

“They called it a reversable
decision,” said McGloin, a teaching

“Reflections are very sad,” Dobbs said funereally,
then left for home.
But those on duty Friday afternoon, those who
mournfully counted down the final minutes, found
time to share some, though certainly not all, of their
most cherished memories.

“There was this midget,” recalled desk clerk Mary
Egler. “He used to get dressed up and advertise for
Phillip Morris Cigarettes in thelobby. He was so
funny, with his derby and all. ”

Some of the popular remembrances concern
celebrities. Maxine Greene, a cafeteria cashier who

assistant in the anthropology
department, “They could cut the
summer program for one year and
bring it back the next if they wanted
to, rather than doing away with
something permanent like the
advising center.”

McGloin said graduate students
would be permitted to teach and
enroll in upper level undergraduate
classes during the third term, but
there would be no graduate courses
or independent studies offered

"because faculty would not be paid

for the springterm.

Also discussed at the meeting
was correspondence received from
director of student activities Willard
“Bud” Heaps who cited , the

possibility of his office claiming all

Posvar Continues
State Funding Quest

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staff Writer
HARRISBURG—Chancellor Pos-
var continued the University's push
for more state funding Friday,
urging the Senate Appropriations
Committee to increase the amount
contained in Governor Shapp’s
budget recommendation for the

‘ next ﬁscal year.

Speaking before a half dozen
committee members assembled
here, Posvar asked for a 10.5
million boost over Shapp’s recom-
mendation that maintained Pitt’s
budget at last year’s level of $60.4
million. Pitt requested $70.9
million for the 1978-79 fiscal year.

Posvar’s statements Friday were
largely the same he made to the
House Appropriations Committee
March 10. Both sessions serve as a
prelude to legislative budget
sessions which are slated to end
June 30 with the completion of a
ﬁnal state budget.

The Chancellor told Senate
committee members that an
additional $10.5 million represents
a seven percent annual increase
given other state agencies the past
three years and that no modiﬁca-
tion in Shapp’s budget would lead
to the third consecutive year Pitt
has received no appropriation
increase from the state.

Posvar said last year’s funding
deadlock, which lingered until late
December, brought a loss in
interest of $950,000 to the

unspent, undesignated funds with-
in the various departments of
FAS-GSO for redistribution should
the organization fail to soon indicate
a purpose for the funds.

“It’s very true that some of the
funds in the accounts have been
unspent for years,” said GSO
president Jim Murphy.

Some talk led to a motion that all
department designate all unspent
funds. The motion was tabled,
however because the proposal from
Heaps is not official.

Murphy also inquired as to the
progress of the Graduate Council in
the area of Teaching‘assitant-teach-

ing fellow evaluation, training and-

supervision, '
In her report, McGloin stated no

University, adding that the state is
still $19.4 million behind in its
payment.

He said Pitt’s budget, after
adjusting for inﬂation, is back to a
1971-level, while the school's

‘enrollment has risen 10 percent.

“So we really had to tighten our
belts to become more efficient as
well as raise tuition,’: Posvar said.
The Chancellor said tuition rates
at Pitt—-among the highest for
state-related schools in the country
—is blocking the way for students
from lower-and-middle-income
families to enroll at the school.
“This,” Posvar added, “is a loss
to Pennsylvania and a cost to
persons who want to move ahead.”
He said the University could
avert another “sharp” tuition hike

‘if the legislature passes the
‘ additional $10.5 million.

Posvar noted that Pitt’s medical
school would receive for the
seventh consecutive year no
increase ‘in appropriations should
the legislature pass Shapp’s
budget intact. He added that
tuition for medical students is
about he same as that of private
schools. 1

As he did before the House
Appropriations Committee, Posvar
painted a picture of higher
education as the “best possible
public investment that forms
capital for the state in the future.”

The Chancellor said Pitt is the

progress has been made primarily
due to a holdup rooted at the
FAS-GSO level where there has
been no recent discussion of the
matter.

“The whole question of how TA’s
and TF’s are taught and evaluated
is a question of these individuals’
employment which should really be
handled by a union with collective
bargaining techniques,” Murphy
said, “This organization or even
Dean Rosenberg’s office are the
inapproprite vehicles by which to do
this.”

A motion was then made to
investigate the possibility of
collective bargaining for graduate

employees. V

Webster Hall Hotel Closed, But Memories Alive

(Continued from Page I)
place this was. He was very nice to the waitresses. He
didn’t look down on us or anything.”

“Mary Costa was another one,” said a waitress
who wished to be known simply as Anne. “She was
one of the nicest customers we ever had, and pretty
too. She went into the kitchen to thank us all.

“She was one of us,” Anne continued. “I like real
people, not the ones who think they’re better than
us.” _

“Jose Greco and Jean Stapleton were the last big
stars to stay here,” said another. “Jean Stapleton
stayed here often, because her daughter goes to
school here at C-MU.”

“Oh, there were so many,” another waitress ad-
ded. “Bobby Vinton, Johnny Mathis—I waited on
him—and who was that dancer? Mann. Johnny
Mann. He gave all of us his autograph.”

And the list goes on and on. From “the guy who
plays accordian for Lawrence Welk” to Jack J ones’s
son, who “we used to chase onto the elevators when
he was little,” Hotel Webster Hall has seen the best

the end of the month, Webster Hall sits vacant,
waiting for renovations that will transform it into an
apartment facility. The thought that the 52-year-old
hotel would be no more was heartbreaking to Web-
ster employees.

“We’ve all been crying,” said bell captain Bill
Davis, a 30-year employee, “including the
customers. We all feel like family here—you have to
feel that way after being together for such a long
time. :

“It became official in January that we would close
down,” Davis said. “Till then, it had only been
rumor. We’d heard the rumors for 20 years, but we
never believed them.

“Our last guest checked out today at quarter after
one, though,” Davis said. “Yep, it’s winding down
now.”

Something very satisfying for Davis and his fellow
workers, who, by the way, now begin their quest for
new employment, is the sentimental return of many

family members. , ,
“People have been coming in for one last look,

“You should have seen everyone here last night,”
desk clerk Egler said. “People were stealing salt
shakers, ash trays, anything they could get as final
souvenirs.

“Another gentleman came in yesterday and
showed me his room bill from his wedding night in
1942,” Egler said. “It cost him $5.50 a night to stay
here. That same bill would be $31 today.”

The loss of other area landmarks, such as Forbes
Field and Duquesne Gardens, has been the main con-
tributor to Webster’s decline in business, Davis
believes, but he had no suggestions as to the real
reason why the management was forced to close the
hotel.

“What hurts us most is to see them put all the
barracades up in the halls,” Davis said. “It’s like
they’re boarding up my house. Then they put up the
liquidation signs, too.” A

With that, maintenance men worked on a per-
manent lock for a lobby door, while cafeteria
workers stripped the tables of their red tablecloths.

Finally, an elderly woman, a 35-year resident.of
the hotel, was escorted out to a waiting van, which

The main consumers of pome-

Following his budget address,
Posvar was questioned by commit-

Former state senator Tom Lamb,
a Pitt lobbyistwho accompanied
Posvar and several other Pitt
administrators to Friday’s hearing,
said it was too early to theorize the

have found better ways of spending
money, he said.

To discover pornography’s ef-
fects on society, the commission
spent a quarter of a million dollars
on public opinion polls and
experiments.

When the poll was conducted in
1969, only two percent of the public
was concerned about pornography,
Lipton said. He said that the public
had no uniform opinion on the
effects of pornography. Answers
ranged from sexual excitement to a
breakdown of morals and a cause of
rapes, he added. The public
believed that children should be
protected from pornography, Lip-
ton said. The poll, he continued,

‘The committee also studied
pornography as a contributing
factor to juvenile delinquency and
sex crimes, Lipton said, adding,
“sexual deviants and juvenile

to pornography than the normal

The commission came up with a

' "72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Responsible Legislators

The primary legislation to be considered by the Pennsylvania
State Legislature soon to convene in Harrisburg is the budget for

the next fiscal year.

Last year, the legislature dillydallied for six months before
finally passing the budget in December. While state legislators
dragged their feet on the issue, agencies throughout Pennsylvania,

including Pitt, suffered. School districts, social welfare agencies
and other state-funded institutions were forced to borrow millions

of dollars.

Pitt borrowed from the School of Graduate Studies Student
Cabinet and area banks to remain open while awaiting new funds
from Harrisburg. Higher education was certainly faced with a sad
dilemmawhich could be blamed, for the most part, on petty par-

tisan squabbling among our elected representatives.

Let us hope the

legislature has more concern about the
Pennsylvanians who are benefitted by state aided institutions this
year. The state assemblymen and senators can first demonstrate
concern by making a sincere effort to debate and pass the state

budget in a reasonable amount of time.

Since the budget is a complicated document, affecting every
policy area, it can not be rushed through the Assembly and Senate
with only cursory debate. Yet, taking six months to finally pass a
budget is inexcuseable. If the Legislature works diligently on the
budget, there is no reason why it can not be placed before the

governor by mid-July.

To further show their concern about their constituents, state
lawmakers can increase the paltry budgeted appropriations for
Pitt. If legislators want to prove they are responsible and care

about this state, they should supply Pitt with more funds.

In the long run, this additional funding benefits the state by
allowing Pittsburgh’s largest employer to maintain its present em-

  Traffic Survey Echoes Ramp Report

After reading the article concern-
ing the launching of the ten-month
survey of Oakland’s transportation
woes in the March 29 issue of The
Pitt News, I can’t help but wonder
why a survey of this type would cost
$50,000. Being a former commuter,
I feel I could answer over half of the
obvious questions that the survey
would raise at a much more
economical price. The study
completed in 1969, titled Ramp
Report, concluded that Oakland was
in dire need of extra parking spaces.

Of course, there was never

anything done to alleviate the
problem then, and now, nine years
later, you feel it will take $50,000 to
come to the same conclusions? Yes,
we need more parking spaces, an
improvement of the bus schedules,
and a better metering system. So
why not use the money to get these
problems solved instead of typing
up the funds in mounds of
questionnaires and unnecessary
paperwork. If it is going to take
until December to compile all the
data of the study, how long before
anything will actually get done-

two, maybe three years?
Or, will the survey end up as

Ramp Report did, in someone’s.,,;O

circular ﬁle? I wish the University
and the City of Pittsburgh would
ﬁnd better uses for the taxpayer’s
money, especially with so many
other transportation problems that
need to be solved immediately. Or
perhaps University ofﬁcials and
members of City Council have yet to
have had their insides jarred by a
pothole.

The second annual, student-
sponsored Preposterous Pentathlon
for the Poor will be held this
weekend at Trees Hall. The idea is
to raise money to feed the hungry.

What with coal strikes, Panama
Canal treaties, PLO raids and
Israeli invasions, world hunger is
not the national issue it was a few
years ago. The food crisis of
1972-74 has given way to wheat
surpluses and depressed farm
prices. The concerns of the 1974
World Food Conference in Rome
have been largely forgotten.

Still, whether or not their fate is
at issue in American political
economics, something like half a
billion people are undernourished
all the time.

There has been a_ lot said-
though perhaps not enough-about
the sad irony of Americans who

complain about high food _prices
are
constantly threatened by starva-
tion. Somewhat less widely preach-
ed is another irony directly related

while 500 million lives

to the Presposterous Pentathlon.

There are, to the best of my
knowledge, three basic approaches

to the problem of hunger abroad.
(There are four

these cutbacks-——and the realign-

ment of priorities that must
accompany them—should certainly
be an essential component of any»

program.)

First, there is what might be
called the corporate restraint
approach.

American multinational corpora-

tions own and use vast tracts of

land in foreign countries. They use

these lands, and the cheap labor

that goes with them, to produce

many of the consumer goods

if you count
cutbacks in American consumption
of food and energy resources, but

Americans crave. That sugar you
had on your cereal for breakfast
and that McDonald’s hamburger
you choked down at lunch are
examples of foods produced in this
way.

Sugar and McDonald’s are nice
(or so we suppose), but the land
used to produce‘ such niceties is
land not available for use by
indigenous populations. If Ameri-
can corporations were not allowed

SIDELINES

to appropriate land in poor
countries, native peoples would
have more freedom to develop their
natural resources in accordance
with their own best interests. Some
experts have suggested that
restraints on the multinationals
would do ,much to eliminate the
problem of hunger abroad, but it
would severely cut corporate
profitability and would mean
radically higher prices for some of
our favorite foods.

The second approach is that
taken by many public and private
policy formulators—establishment
of a massive grain reserve.

The driving force behind this
approach is the potential for price
stability. Grain would be altemate-
ly stored and sold according to
predetermined market price indica-
tors, thereby balancing world
supply and demand and maintain-
ing prices within acceptable boun-
daries. If the reserve's initial
capacity was large enough, grain
costs would neither rise high
enough to price poor nations out of
the market (as happened in
1972-74), nor fall low enough to

cause profitability problems for
farmers in developed countries.

The third approach to hunger
relief, the approach that has been
and remains most popular in this
country, is charity.

The charity approach is relatively
simple; those who have more than
they need give some of their excess
to r those who have less. This
Saturday's Preposterous Pentath-
lon is one of the many church, civic
and social endeavors that fall into
the general category of charity.

Now, the irony here is this—the
probable effectiveness of each of
these three approaches to hunger
relief is inversely related to the
probability of that method becom-
ing a part of American public
policy.

Getting the multinationals out of
other peoples’ soil would probably
do the most to "alleviate hunger
abroad. But immensely powerful
corporate lobbies—not to mention
consumers who imagine them-

‘selves heavily burdened by present

food prices—are quite willing and
able to guide legislators away from
such politically hazardous initia-
tives. (It is worth noting here that
Americans spend less than one-
ﬁfth of their disposable income on
food, while many people in poorer
nations spend more than one-half?)

Grain reserves are somewhat
more politically feasible, and it
appears that the United States may
actually establish one—but not
without a fight. Initial acquisition
costs for an adequate reserve are
quite high, and tax money for
“foreign aid” does not ﬂow
willingly from Washington's cof-
fers. (The United States. for
instance, ranks relatively low

among the developed nations in
percentage of GNP devoted to
non-military foreign aid.) Some
farmers also have been leery of
grain reserves because they re-
member the detrimental effects of
mismanaged surpluses during the
1960’s. ,

On the other hand, charities
ﬂourish in America. No doubt they
are vital to the survival and the
minimal well-being of many,
many people.

But charities provide woefully
insufficient relief for so massive ,

‘hurt. Even if Americans were as’

generous as we seem to think we
are—which is doubtful—we could
never give away enough penny-
rolls to feed half a billion people.
Nor could we give those people the
dignity and political freedom they
lack when they are dependent on
our largesse.

So, one can’t help but wonder
about a people that dispenses
charity with its left hand, while

using its right to create and .
maintain the need for that charity. I
In fact, one wonders how importah A‘

the lives and freedoms 'of others
can be to a nation of almsgivers.

This, of course, is not to
downgrade those persons who put
tremendous time and effort into
raising money for the poor. Their
work is probably more important
than we, or they, can realize.

It is very important, for instance,
that as many of us as possible give
as much as possible « to the
Presposterous Pentathlon for the
Poor. As things now stand, many of
the world’s hungry are desperate»
for our contributions. .

We would do well, however. to
remember what a sad irony that is.

Sawed in Half — A Side-Splitting Experience

ByMARIASCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

Last December, Ihad a chance to
perform in one of the most
fascinating feats of a magician’s
repertoire—being sawed in half.

Interesting yes, but also a little
scary. After. all, world-renowned
illusionist Doug Henning had
ﬂawlessly performed this act of
legerdemain on live, coast-to-coast
television (with Julie Newmar as
his “victim,” no less) and it
certainly looked real enough.

Before even attempting this,
however, I had to ﬁnd out if the
magician, David Seebach, would
consent to sawing a total stranger
in half while being photographed.
Seebach was cooperative, but
warned that whoever he was to
divide could be no taller than 5 feet
3 inches in height. I was in.

We agreed to meet at 1:00 at the
Stephan Foster Memorial Theater
that following Monday. At this
time. Divad (as Seebach is known

‘breezed

grapher, had forgotten our appoint-
ment, I began to argue with myself:
“Should I leave? No, what if he
shows up and I’m not here? He
would have been here by now, so
I’ll leave. O.K., just ﬁve more
minutes...” Deep in thought, I
hadn’t noticed the tall, slender man
sporting a mustache and glasses
who had just rounded the comer.
Divad had arrived.

We discussed the magician’s
college days in Wisconsin and he
described some of the large-scale
illusiions used in his “Great
International Magic Show.”

The sawing-the-lady-in-half illu-
sion, he explained, is a feat
included in practically every
professional’s act. If and when
Keith showed up, Seebach could
show us how the trick was
performed.

Around 1:45, the photographer

being late. The three of us walked

professionally) would explain to me
how he creates the illusion.

On the designated day, I arrived
early and sat in the lobby, feeling
foolish in my garb of black leotard
and ﬂesh-colored tights with a
silk shirt worn
jacket-style over the leotard. After
ﬁve minutes, I opted to slip on a
pair of jeans brought along in case
self-consciousness began to plague
me. A ﬂoor-mopping janitor and
several patrons of the lobby
box-ofﬁce cast inquiring glances as
I waited and waited.

By 1:25, partially convinced that
Seebach and Keith, the photo-

narrow, two-piece box set upon a
table roughly 2 feet by 51/2 feet. I
stripped down to the leotard outﬁt
again and shivered as a rush of cold
air streamed out from between
openings in the heavy red curtain.
As Seebach helped me jump up
onto the table, he asked, “Now,
you’re not going to tell anyone how
we did this, are you?”

I assured him that I could keep a
secret and no, I would not tell a
soul. With that, I slipped into the
box through hinged openingsat the
top and lay facing the bright stage
lights overhead.

Seebach explained how the

Oakland State

By TERRI VOGT
. Pitt News Staff Writer

After a 40 year residency, the
Oakland State Store now has to look
for a new location. The store will
close on April 8.

The landlords are made up of a
partnership that includes the
Schwartz and Coyne families, some
of whom are state employees. They
have decided not to renew the State
Liquor Control Board’s lease,
because of a recent opinion arising
from the Pennsylvania state legis-
lators, according to Henry
Schwartz of the Oakland Real
Estate Co.

“The Legislature’s opinion is

_ that anyone who works for the state

cannot rent to any state owned or
operated business,” explained
Schwartz. “Inour case, we would
rather not jeopardize ourselves.”

Schwartz also explained the
current surge of local State Store
closings. ‘

“The prohibition rariod must
have ended and the fate Stores
contracted leases that tart on the

same date each year. It is
coincidence that those stores are

having rent problems now,”

Schwartz said. The Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill State Stores have a
one month extention on their

leases, and may be forced to

relocate due to higher rent, LCB
ofﬁcials said.

Mazzotta Stylists Come To Pitt

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s service sorority Gamma
Gamma Sigma sponsored a free
six-hour marathon of hairstyling
Thursday, featuring the Mazzotta
stylists of Mount Lebanon. Not only
were Pitt students able to take
advantage of free beauty treat-
ments, but Joseph Mazzotta,
co-owner of the salon, offered some
advice about current trends as well.

“We believe in fashion adapted
to personality and lifestyle,”
Mazzotta said.

Currently, the look is a softer,

illusion would be created and
picked up a sheet of metal.

“This is it,” I thought. “Why
couldn't I have been 5 feet 4?”

The magician forced the gleam-
ing metal down through the middle
of the brightly painted box and
wheeled away the half of the table
on which rested my legs and the
lower part of the box. At this point,
I was literally beside myself.

As photographs were taken, I
turned my head sideways and saw

7

that a small crowd had gathered in
the previously empty room. Feeling

somewhat akin to a creature in the
200, I was relieved when Seebach
wheeled the table back together
again in order to put me back
together again. This was accom-

plished with greater ease than the
first half of the trick.

I did not emerge totally

unharmed from the box; splinters

_ .. ,5-°-"'s,.,',‘

were the biggest nuisance. Be-
cause of the splinters, however,
when friends later tried to wheedle
out the secret of sawing a lady in
half, Icould truthfully say, “Yes, it
did hurt.”

As an eerie sidelight, I might add
that Keith’s pictures were ruined
when something went wrong with
his camera’s shutter. When it

comes to filming magic, I suppose,
some things are best left alone.

 

Magician Divad performed illusions at Pitt last term, most notably sawing a

woman in half.

Pittsburgh LCB commented that

they are currently checking out
every possible site. The state must

ﬁnd a store room with large enough
display and storage areas. as well

as a good location. Realizing that
the college community is a maior

looser, thirtyish trend, Mazzotta
said, “with lots of highlights.”

The most popular techniques
veer away from pale blonde streaks
added at random for a more natural
look.

“We use sunbursting—that’s
based on the glow from the
sun—and butterscotching, which is
blending in several warm shades of
blonde,” Mazzotta said.

The Italian-born stylist said that
permanents, from tight curl to body
waves, are much in demand.

“We’re looking for a strong curl
as opposed to the straight look of a

The student reaction to the
closing has been varied. “It doesn't
effect me at all,” said a junior

few years back,” Mazzotta said.
Working on Pitt students gave a
few revelations to Mazzotta. For
one thing, he said, the overuse of
blowdryers was much in evidence.
“We’re not relying on the dryer
to do styling,” he said. “That’s one
reason why perms are becoming so
important. We’re using light—heat
lamps and dryers with lamps
attached. We also use dry settings
with heat rollers, and some new
special rollers that adhere directly
to the hair without pins or clamps. ”
“Most of the kids don’t pay
enough attention to their hair.”

wearing their hair too ﬂat for the
clothes they are wearing.”

Mazzotta also exploded some
popular myths circulating in
magazines like “Cosmopolitan”
and “Glamour.”

“Henna is not the great cure-all
everyone claims it is,” he said. “It
is healthier than most commercial
products, but it does not beneﬁt the
hair particularly. In fact, it tends to
build up on the hair shaft. One or
two treatments are fine, but after
that, you have to get the henna
removed.” —

And despite the claims about
conditioning beneﬁts of different
makes of shampoo, all types are
basically the same.

“The purpose of shampoo is for
cleaning,” Mazzotta said. “It
makes no difference what brand is
used. Conditioning is done after the
cleaning with specific products.”

Mazzotta said that dryness and

most damage can be repaired via ‘

reconditioning and reconstruction.
“There’s no such thing as “too
much” conditioning,” he said.
“The hair shaft will only absorb as
much as it needs. And I noticed
much need for conditioning today.
There were lots of elasticity
problems; normally, a hair can be
stretched out 40 percent when wet,
then snap back into shape. But with

replenishing the hair, problems are
caused.”

Another problem is that people
tend to stick with the same brand of
shampoo.

“You should alternate between
two brands—one mild and one deep
cleaning,” Mazzotta said. “The
secret to controlling dandruff is
deep cleaning.

“The most difﬁcult part of our
business is that it’s not just one look
anymore. It’s true that geometries
are out, but the new look can be
interpreted in a variety of different
ways. People are looking for their
own identity, and we try to put
together a look that’s a combination
of ideas.”

Pitt News Staff Writer

Noel Paul Stookey, more popu-
larly known as the middle man of
the legendary Peter, Paul& Mary,
brought folksy music and unending
humour to Oakland’s Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial Hall yesterday
for a glimpse of the past and an
ideology of the present.

Performing before a disappoin-
tingly small crowd, Stookey showed
that he hasn’t lost his ability to
captivate an audience, while
bringing across his conversion to
Christianity. Best symbolizing his
newdirection in life was the classic
“The Wedding Song,” which
Stookey had written for the

Pitt News Staff Writer
Some ﬁlms fall into a category
that can only be described as
“p1easant”—no strong dramatic
plot, no deep message, just fun to
watch. “House Calls’ ” is such a

‘ ﬁlm. It is a comedy that needs no

reason to exist: it makes people
laugh, and that is all that is
important.

delightful mixture of slobbery and
sophistication, plays Charlie, a

Charlie returns to the hospital

He hopes to discover all the

On his return, Charlie meets Ann

patient under the care of the chief of

She’s been playing women’s
music since before women’s music
was called women’s music. She’s a
long-time feminist and a genuinely
funny woman. She has a large and
growing group of fans embedded in
and gay rights

‘Sponsored by the Undergraduate
Women’s Union as part of the
Women’s Cultural Festival this
weekend, Tyson and Susan Abod
will appear in concert Saturday at
8:30 p.m. in the Graduate School of
Public Health Auditoriuim. Pitt
students are admitted free with ID
and current validation.

Coming from a small town in
Florida, Tyson said her only formal
music training was in her church
choir and her high school band. She

“There were 300 pressed, mostl

marriage of Peter Yarrow, who,
along with Mary Travers, formed
the remaining two-thirds of PP&M.

Stookey, appearing in Pittsburgh
for the ﬁrst time since 1970 when

PP&M dissolved, also revived the
style that had made the group so

popular in the l960‘s. A cappella
renditions of “My Hat” and “The

Building Block That Was Rejected

New World,” the latter of which
featured Stookey playing his

humourist with his ability to
entrance a crowd.

remedy. As a result, Charlie is
captivated both by Ann’s charm and
by Carney’s threats to ﬁre him if he
(Charlie) doesn’t nominate him for
another term as chief of staff.

Charlie begins to date many
glamorous women, all younger than
he is, but at the same time he dates
Ann, who is closer to his own age.
He soon realizes that he enjoys
Ann’s company much more than
that of the other women, but he is
unwilling to commit himself to her,
afraid he will miss something better
(and younger).

Ann, a digniﬁed lady, refuses to
be just one of many. She manages to
wrangles Charlie into a two-week
trial relationship. But on their
two-week anniversary Charlie
wines and dines the young widow of
a recent Ken Gen patient, all in an
effort to persuade her to drop the
malpractice suit she is bringing
against the hospital. Ann
ceremoniously kicks Charlie out of
the house.

Spurred by Ann’s rejection and
by her accusations that he is too
cowardly to stand up to the inept
chief of staff, Charlie withdraws
his nomination of Carney for the
post. He then chases around the city
in an ambulance trying to ﬁnd Ann.

They ﬁnally reunite in the middle
of a busy intersection, and Charlie
at last pursuades Ann to give their
relationship another two weeks.

This simple comedy plot is

not all that bad for a ﬁrst album, but
you always look back at your first
effort and cringe. I cut it in the
studio in one night.”

Her second album, backed by
loans from friends and a bank, was
an accomplishment in 1974. she
created a recording company, Lima
Bean Records, and cut the album
“Full Count” in the early morning
hours in 5 days. The main back-up
guitarist “was a buddy who did it
for nothing.” The engineer also
volunteered his services without
Pay-

“It is easy-listening folk music,”
Tyson said. “It is not heavily
produced because we didn’t have
the money or studio time to do it. I
like the folk sound of it. There isn’t
much of that kind of music coming
out now.”

The album has sold about 9,000
copies.

“It has been selling steadily
which is a good sign. That means
people are telling friends about it.

“I went to Maine in 1976 to work
on Casse Culver’s album Three
Gypsies with Urana Records, a

The balding musician’s some-
times excellent skill as a songwriter

bared itself in the forms of
“Sebastian,” a song played on a

guitar, written about a guitar
person (Sebastian), and “Spring-

time,” Stookey’s opening number,
which unearthed his love for a clean
ecology.

But, just as Stookey talked, in one

of his famous monologues, about
his “premeditated encore,” he
knew that those new songs would
not be enough to satisfy his
audience. His career in show
business was experience enough to

greatly enhanced by the expertise of
Matthau and Jackson. The contrast
between their comedic stvles——
Matthaus’s broad humor and
Jackson’s reserved sarcasm_—
creates humor in even the smallest
scene. When Ann innocently
reveals the score of a delay-telecast
basketball game Charlie is watching
her clipped “sorry” completely
devastates his frantic raging about
the uselessness of watching a game
when he already knows the score.

Visual humor is one of the ﬁlm’s
strongest points. The writers have
found many funny ways to
accentuate the difference between
Jackson’s slim digniﬁed ﬁgure and
Matthau’s slovenly potbelly.

In their ﬁrst love scene, the two
are lying on a bed watching an old
movie. When Jackson mentions
that in those days a couple couldn’t
be shown together on a bed unless
each had one foot on the ﬂoor. they
set out to see if two people could
make love in such a position. The
result is a tumult of squirming
bodies (fully clothed) as the pair
ﬁnally ends up on the ﬂoor,
exhausted, for their ﬁrst kiss. ’

The supporting cast is just
that—supporting. While all
performances are adequate, the
only outstanding one is that of Art
Carney as the senile chief of staff.
Carney bumbles his way through
the hospital, forgetting doctors and
patients alike and falling asleep on

By CINDI EVAN GELISTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Music affects people in different
ways, but John Hall’s ﬁrst solo
album (“John Hall”) since leaving
Orleans (“Dance With Me” and
“Still the One”) does more than
merely affect. It stirs things up.

“If you’re going to be dissatis-
ﬁed with the way things are, you.’re
going to be rebellious,” Hall is
quoted in a press release.
“You’re going to try to stir things

come to (hear, and that was the

singing of the oldies, such as “Day
Is Done” and the fabled '“Puff (the
Magic Dragon).”

Oregon native Pam Mark Hall,
who once had fantasies of being part
of “Peter, Paul &Pam,” provided
melodic warmup to Stookey’s

presentation. Expressing her life
philosophies and new being
through song, much in the same

manner as Stookey did, Hall’s
musical characters ranged from the

ﬁctitious Christopher Robin of
Winnie the Pooh fame to “Kathy,”

the job. He delivers such lines as
“Hurry up, nurse, you know how
short my attention span is,” with
the irascibility of an old man who
realizes he is going fast but hates to
be reminded of it.

“House Calls’ ” story, then, is

a prostitute in search of love. Hall’s
theme for love reached its summit in
her version of James Taylor’s
“Shower the People.”

Stookey and Hall, who were aided’
only by the simplest of audio
equipment and lighting effects,
together and separately, were
successful. Hall’s sweet-sounding

vocals and Stookey’s guitar_ and
charming personality were all the
equipment that was needed.

The only disappointment was that
more people were not on hand to
enjoy two persons and their
new-found joys.

“We had 40 times more money,

Hall Fills a Void

up, you have to stir them in a
direction. If there’s a void, I feel
like I have to ﬁll it.”

If ever there was a void in his
music, Hall ﬁlls it up in this album
with every type of sound imagin-
able, from rock ’n roll to blues to a
little touch of calypso. Side one
starts with “Night,” a rhythm and
blues song, then goes ‘on to
“Messin’ Round With the Wrong
Woman” and “Trust Yourself,”
ﬁne attempts at fusing together

rhythm and blues with rock ’n roll.

Hall excels in vocals and is
brought to even higher plateaus
with his back-up vocals, who
include The Persuasions, James
Taylor, Carly Simon, Bonnie Raitt,
Lowell George and Garland Jeff-
reys. The back-up group isn’t too
bad either‘—they’re made up of

Crusaders, and Little Feat’s Bill
Payne, who does a hot solo number
with the synthesizer in “The
Fault” on side two.

“Give Me The Right,” a song
reminiscent of George Benson,
shows Hall’s potential in the music
scene, enough to say that he is
comparable if not equal—to balla-
deer Dar: Fogelberg.

“Grown Enough,” once record-
ed by Raitt, is made even better
and more sophisticated with jazz
greats David Sanbom and Michael
Brecker on alto and tenor sax,
respectively.

Hall deﬁnitely stirs the music fan
with this album—it’s well produced
and arranged by Hall and Chuck
Plotkin. The last cut, “Voyager,”
is a six-and-one-half minute ‘ ‘semi-
symphonic number,” and brings
out the best in Hall with Taylor and
wife Simon backing him up.

There’s only one direction for
John Hall and that is UP.

 

John Hall formerly gang lead with Orleans, now he’s exploring a solo career via
recently released debut album, “John Hall.”

over the arranging. I just fantasized
about the stories and came up with
arrangements.

‘ ‘Willie played backgammon and
watched everything happen in the
studio. She would say she liked this
and hated that and that’s how it
happened.”

Humor plays a large part in all of
Tyson’s shows.

same time. So she would talk, and
talk, and talk. She’s funny and she
can make people relax. The raps are
now part of her show,” Abod said.

“The monologue is an art in
itself,” Tyson said. “Some of the
time I was stalling for time but last
year I started thinking of it as a
viable and valuable part of my
performance. In the South I’ve
been called the feminist Will
Rogers.”

The humor is carried over into her
songs. Most make you laugh, like

In the 14th annual Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic at the Civic Arena Friday
night, the California all-stars defeated the
Keystone stars, 101-78 in the first game,
while the United States stars topped
Pennsylvania’s stars, 105-100. More than
16,000 fans attended the annual high school
talent show, including hordes of basketball
coaches and recruiters.

Jackie Sherrill and Joe Paterno even took
time off from their football duties to view the
roundball action.

Tom Parks, a 6-5 forward from Belle
Vernon, won MVP honors for the
Keystoners, while Los Angeles’ Jose
Slaughter received the award for California.

Pennsylvania Squads Fall Short in Roundball Classic

SPORTS

The Keystone team led 24-19 after the first
quarter but soon collapsed under the depth
and height of California team.

Darrell Gissendanner. a 6-1 guard from
Clairton, who Pitt is recruiting heavily,
failed to score, but showed both good
quickness and also the need for a harness on
his style of play.

In the nightcap 6-7 Bruce Atkins of
Wilkensburg displayed the type of play
which has made him one of the top prospects
in Pennsylvania this year.

Despite season-long knee injuries, Atkins
scored 22 points and pulled down 15
rebounds to keep Pennsylvania in conten-
tion until late in the game. Atkins, who along
with Schenley’s Jim Smith is said to be
leaning to Wisconsin, was so popular that

-the crowd chanted “We want Atkins’ ’ when

he was benched during the fourth quarter.

The biggest disappointment to the fans
was the play of Clarence Tillman, who only
scored ﬁve points and didn’t appear to be
mentally in the game.

For the United States, 6-5 Walker Russell
of Pontiac, Michigan was his team’s MVP.
Russell and another U.S. player, 6-5 Kevin
Stallings of Illinois, have expressed interest
in Pitt.

Dwig_ht Anderson, 6-3 guard from
Dayton, Ohio has signed with Kentucky,
although there are rumors that he may be.
academically ineligible for next season,
while 6-5 Rich Harmon of Cape May, NJ.
has inked with Syracuse.

Other names being associated with Pitt
are former Fifth Avenue star Bill Clarke,
now at Allegheny Community College,
Towson Maryland’s 6-5 Tony Guy, and
Norwin’s Doug Arnold. There is a possibility

.that Pitt may make a late pitch for Bruce

Atkins. Pitt’s only signed recruit is 6-8 Ed
Wallace of Bartrum High in Philadelphia.

A bit of spring cleaning at Trees
Courts Friday resulted in Pitt’s 5-4
tennis victory over California State.

The Panthers, many of whom
helped maintenance crews sweep
puddles of water off the courts
hours before the match, did some
cleaning up with their racquets a
little later by avenging last year’s
6-3 loss to California. -

“It was raining pretty hard at
11:30, and we nearly cancelled the
match,” said Pitt coach George

. waitanother half hour, and hoped
it would clear up. It turned out to
be a pretty nice day.”

The win gave Pitt a 4-2 record
heading into today’s contest at
Robert Morris. The Panthers are
then idle until Thursday, when
Penn State,‘perhaps their toughest
competition, comes to town ﬁor a 2
p.m. match at Trees.

Dieffenbach said his Panthers

team in three years—a California
squad that is perhaps even slightly
stronger than it had been in the
past.

“We’re very happy with the
win,” he said, “but the guys know
they have a lot of work to do.
They’re not overconﬁdent at this
point.” p,

The match, which ended in
darkness at 7 p.m., had several
close encounters. Tom Liebenguth
and Chuck Brand, Pitt’s number
one and four men, respectively,
each played the three-set limit, and
responded with pressure wins.

“Tom and Chuck were the last
ones off the courts,” Dieffenbach
said of the concurrently played
singles matches. “We were down,
3-1, and they both knew it. They
handled the pressure real well.’’

While Brand was handling
Ca1ifornia’s Bryant Aldstadt, 7-5,
5-7, 6-3, Liebenguth was into a
tie-breaking situation with Scott
Brooke. After splitting the first two
sets, 6-4, 6-7, Liebenguth fought
back from a 5-1 deficit. in the third
set to emerge a 7-6 victor.

“It was an incredible come-
back,” Dieffenbach said. “Brooke
shou1d’ve put Tom away, but he
couldn't. Tom just hung in there
and concentrated on each point. He
broke a couple of serves, kept
service in his games and won the
tie breaker.”

The third and ﬁnal, doubles
match, composed of Brand and Joe
Mayers, ended in a similar
comeback fashion. With the team
match tied at four, and with the
sun slowly sinking, Brand and
Mayers beat Mike Hass and Dennis
Cade, 3-6, 7-6, 7-5.

After losing the first set,
Brand-Mayers trailed 4-1, in the
second before the crowd of 30 or so
persons got behind the Panther
duo. ‘

“They were cheering after every
point,” Dieffenbach said. “It
shows that crowd support can
really help us.”

In other matches, Bill Pilardi,
who played despite his bout with
the ﬂu, beat Gary Krauss, 6-1, 6-1.
Pilardi later teamed with Lieben-
guth with an equally impressive
6-2, 6-3 victory over Krauss and
Brooke. i

Califomia’s Mark Sheaffer beat
Kevin Quay, 6-4, 6-2, while
Panther Tom Gault lost to Cade,
7-5, 6-2. The Gault-Quay combina-
tion also lost in doubles action, 6-4,
6-3, to Aldstadt and Sheaffer.

The number-six singles match
ended in a 7-6, 6-3 victory for
California’s Hass over George
Hoffman.

Tony May Be a Confused Guy, but Tim Holds no Grudge

1/ There were varying reports from Maryland
yesterday concerning Tony Guy, the 6-6 guard-
forward from Towson’s Loyola High who is at the
top of Grgurich’s recruiting list.

"  I First came the story of
Grgurich’s recent 7 o’clock
appointment with Guy, who
was four hours late. Grgurich
was patient enough to wait un-
til 11, but when the Pitt
coach learned Guy had spent
the previous four hours with
current Kansas assistant coach
  -, (and former Pitt assistant)
TONY GUY Bob Hill, Grgurich’s message.
to Guy was “goodbye ” Grgurich reconsidered,
however, and has since talked with Guy on more
amicable terms.

A high school writer for one of Baltimore’s daily
newspapers, however, said he believed, after talking
with Guy, that Baltimore’s top prospect probably
would sign with Marquette soon. “He wants to go
somewhere he could play right away,” the writer told
The "Pitt News, “and Pitt has several guards back. I
asked him if he had made any decision and he smiled
and said, ‘Yeah, I think I’ve made up my mind.’ ”

But a call to Jerry Savage, Guy’s coach and
Grgurich’s friend, brought a different response. “I
thought it was down to Pitt (Grgurich) and Kansas
(Hill),” Savage said, repeating recent Field House
rumor. “I doubt he’s interested in Marquette——he.

to Pitt and he’s been there on other occasions with
me.

“There’s definitely a chance he’ll go to Pitt,”
Savage continued. “He knows several players, he’s
been around the cmapus and he’s played at the Field
House.”

What Savage and the writer agreed upon was
Guy’s ability. “At 6-6, he can play an excellent

guard,” Savage said. “He handles the ball, is an
outside shooter and perhaps his best facet is his
passing.” '

“He was the guy Loyola used to break a press,”

' the writer said of Guy, a McDonald’s and Parade all-

America who averaged 23 points and 13 rebounds per
game this season. “He’s the best player coming out
of Baltimore this year.”

./ A previously unmentioned (in Pittsburgh) name
has been connected with Pitt basketball recruiting.
Duane Wallace, a 6-2 guard from Baltimore’s Dun-
bar High, reportedly is the willing subject of a Pitt’

“Pitt has a good chance at this kid,” a Baltimore
source said. “He hasn’t made any visits yet, but he
dazzled the crowd at a recent Knights of Columbus
tournament. Pitt is talking to him.”

Wallace, playing point guard, averaged 15 points
and nearly eight assists per game this season for
Dunbar, the city champions. Last season, playing
shooting guard for Baltimore’s City College High,
Wallace averaged more than 20 points per game.

v   Cramp Cancels Trew’s All-America Bid  

ByKARENKADILAK
pm News Staff Writer

Going into the 1,650 yard,
freestyle at last week's NCAA
swimming and diving champion-
ships in Long Beach, California,
Pitt’s Jeff Trew ﬁgured he would be
in for a tough time. I

With swimmers like Olympic
champions Brian Goodell and
Bobby Hackett also entered in the
event, Trew hoped to ﬁnish among
the top 12 and make all-America.

After developing a cramp in his
side midway through the race, Trew
found it hard to ﬁnish the event, let
alone contend with swimmers like
eventual ﬁrst and second place
ﬁnishers Goodell of UCLA and
Harvard’s Hackett for all-America
honors. Goodell and Hackett also
ﬁnished one-two at the 1976

Cavanaugh
Honored

V Matt Cavanaugh will receive
the ﬁrst Gerald B. Zomow
award at a Rochester, N.Y.
banquet on April 10.

According to a spokesman
for the University of Rochester,
which is presenting the award,
it will be given each year to a
top college athlete who also
exhibits outstanding leadership
qualities.

Zornow, for whom the award
is named, was a president and
board chairman of the Eastman
Kodak Co. until his retirement
last year. He played football,
basketball and baseball for
Rochester before he graduated
in 1937.

Montreal Olympics in the 1,500
meter freestyle.

“It was really weird,” Trew said
about his eventual 27th-place
ﬁnish. “I was doing well in the ﬁrst
part of the race. Then, all of a
sudden I got this cramp in my side. I
never had anything like it in my life.

“Boy, was it painful. I could
hardly inhale the last half of the
race. I've swam before when I had
the ﬂu and couldn’t breathe very
well, but this was a different
feeling.

“This was scarier,’ Trew_
continued. “Not only couldn’t I
breathe, I couldn’t swim very fast,
either.”

The cramp couldn’t have come at
a worst time for Trew, as far as
Panther swim coach Dick Bradshaw
was concerned.

“His pace during the ﬁrst 800
yards or so of the race was as good
as he’s had all year, if not better,”
explained Bradshaw. “If he had
kept up this kind of pace during the
last 800 or so yards, there was no
reason he couldn’t have made
all-America.

“It could have been from
nervousness, it could have been
from anything,” Bradshaw contin-
ued, trying to explain the nature of
Trew’s cramp. “It’s just one of
those things that happen; one of
those things you wish would never
happen.”

“I don’t know what could have
caused it,” said Trew, pointing out
that he didn’t have any similar
problems while swimming in the
800-yard freestyle relay the pre-
vious day. “Swimmers get cramps
occasionally, but you really don’t
get them in competition. That’s
why it’s crazy.”

Great Pitching Leads Pitt to Doubleheader Win

By MARK MURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Proving that good baseball can
be played in the foulest of baseball
weather, Pitt took advantage of a
pair of superlative pitching efforts
and cruised to a doubleheader
sweep over Carnegie-Mellon yes-
terday, downing the Tartans 8-1
and 4-0 at Trees Field.

On a day more suited for a nordic
ski championship, the Panthers
overcame wind, cold and a
late-afternoon hailstorm to raise
their record to 2-1. C-MU, in its
first year of baseball existence,
never had a chance against Pitt and
was battered into surrender by the
pitching pair of sophomore Don
Koller and freshman Mike Luciow.

Koller went the distance in the
ﬁrst game, striking out 13 while
allowing only three hits and four
walks. Luciow, a freshman pitching
in his ﬁrst college game, was as
impressive as his teammate in the
nightcap, fanning 14 while letting
up three hits and ﬁve bases on
balls.

After getting out of a second-
and-third jam in the top of the first,
Koller received all the runs he
would need in the bottom half of
the opening frame.

Tartan starter Jim Patterson
walked the bases loaded, base-
ball’s answer to Chinese water
torture, and Pitt’s designated
hitter, Dave Dicello, made sure of
Patterson’s slow death when he
ripped a two-out single to left to
drive home two runs.

Koller continued his mastery
over the novice Tartans, striking

out the side in the second inning, a
feat he was to duplicate in the
seventh frame. The Panthers
added to their 2-0 lead in their half
of the inning on a double by
rightﬁelder Mark Stevens and Don
Nania’s safety via a C-MU
throwing error.

The 3-0 advantage grew by two
more in the third inning. Following
a Kurt Leitholf single and an Art
Bortnick flyout, catcher Jim Pastin
roped Patterson’s idea of a fastball
well over the left ﬁeld fence for his
ﬁrst home run of the year, giving
Pitt a 5-0 lead.

“We’re still not hitting the way
we could,” Pitt coach Bobby Lewis

said after his team collected nine 1,

hits in the opener but only four in
the nightcap. “But the more. the
batters get up the more conﬁdence
they’ll get and the better we’ll do.”

Koller lost his shutout in the
fourth when C-MU rightﬁelder
Craig Hladik knocked one out of the
park, driving the ball farther than
all other Tartan hits combined. But
any thoughts of a rally were quickly
squashed by Pitt in the fourth, as it
scored its ﬁnal three runs of the
game.

Pitt’s Rich Kline greeted new
pitcher John Tooch with a leadoff
double. One out later, Stevens
singled, but Kline couldn’t move
along on .the safety. Nania then

singled, scoring Kline, and Leitholf -

rapped another hit, driving home
both Stevens and Nania.

Pitt would not score again, but
the Tartans did little more than
watch Koller pitch the final three
innings, collecting no hits and the

“Though I’m an Army Nurse, I can also pursue outside

“One of the pluses of Army Nursing is the nature of

ﬁrst stages of frostbite. Koller
struck out the side in the seventh
inning to end the carnage, and the
Panthers looked ahead to similar
fun and games in the nightcap.

The second game featured a
two-inning pitching duel between
Luciow and C-MU’s Art Papay. The
duel and the day’s competition
ended when Papay was removed
from the game for no apparent
reason, and Pitt jumped on his
successor, Bob McNall, for two
runs. A two-out double by Leitholf
scored Chris Mihlaik to give Pitt
the only run it needed. Bortnik
brought home Leitholf with a single
to left.

The Panthers scored again in the
fourth and once more in the
seventh, but, thanks to Luciow, it
was no longer a question of who,
just by how many. The righthander
fanned three Tartan batters in the
sixth and another in the seventh, as
both clubs did their best to end the
game before the small hailstones
became large enough to make
substitute baseballs.

“I was pleased with our pitching
today,” Lewis said, admitting he
couldn’t make that same statement
Saturday after being stomped 16-4
by Duquesne. “We have to keep
getting that good pitching to win. ”

Carr Wins

Seattle (AP)—Ann Carr of Penn
State, who missed the 1976
Olympics with a sprained ankle,
looked unmistakably like a cham-
pion Saturday night at the
Association for Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women national gymnas-
tics championships here.

The 20-year-old sophomore, be-
fore a crowd of 4,688 at the
University of Washington, won the
individual trophies in the ﬂoor
exercise, balance beam and uneven
bars. On Friday, she won all-
around honors.

Carr said she was more relaxed
on Saturday after Friday's pressure
of becoming the ﬁrst woman ever
to repeat as all-around champion

Gym Title

and helping Penn State win the
team trophy.

“I felt better on the floor
exercise and uneven bars, but I was
a little shaky on the balance
beam,” she said. “I guess I wasn’t
in proper frame of mind for the
beam. I felt like I could really
perform. I wasn’t so afraid of
making mistakes.”

Kolleen Casey of Southwest
Missouri State won the vaulting
event Saturday night - the only
individual championship in the
two-day meet that escaped Carr.

Penn State won the team title
with 147.70 to second place Cal
State-Fullerton at 147.55 and
Southwest Missouri at 145.05.

Pirates Top Phils, 4-1

By The Associated Press

CLEARWATER, Fla. — Steve
Nicosia scored from second in the

top of the 13th inning on a muffed
double play by Bob Boone to give
the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4-1 victory
over Philadelphia in exhibition
baseball Sunday.

Fernando Gonzales followed with
a triple and Dave Parker’s single,
his ﬁfth hit of the day, scored two
more runs to insure the victory.

Steve Waterbury, 0-1, was tagged
for the loss. Waterbury, who
pitched the ﬁnal three innings,
walked Nicosia and Omar Moreno to
open the 13th.

After Pirate pinch hitter Mike
Easler struck out, Frank Taveras hit
a grounder to second baseman Bud
Harrelson, who forced Moreno. But
Boone, the Phillies’ regular catcher,
muffed Harrelson’s throw at ﬁrst
and Nicosia scored the winning run.

Pittsburgh scored in the first on a
