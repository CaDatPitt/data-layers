Clinton celebrates victory

    
 

President'Bill Clinton won re-elec-
tion last night, and a statewide exit poll
showed that Pennsylvania’s political
moderates and liberals joined to help
the incumbent grasp an early victory by
winning the state’s 23 electoral votes.
More than half the voters surveyed
said the economy and the future of
Medicare and Social Security mattered
to them the, most in deciding how to
vote, according to the Associated Press.
At 9:05 p.m., the news stations
across the country predicted Clinton’s
victory over Republican nominee Bob
Dole, and the results from around the
state and across the nation were tallied
and broadcast to a group of excited
Democratic supporters at the Station

Once it appeared that Republicans
would continue to control Congress,
Clinton said “It is time to put politics

aside’ join together andget thejob done It is time to put politics aside  and get the job done, says President Clinton.

  

for America’s future.” .

Very few of the election results
were a surprise to Democratic support-
ers.

“It wasn’t expected for Democratic
candidates in Pennsylvania to do so

Student voters pack the polls

of low

Regardless
voter turnout across the
nation, Pitt voters packed
the polls yesterday but still
pondered the propositions
put forth by the candidates
in the last election of the
20th century.

Lines formed at many
of the numerous district
voting booths within
Oakland, which makes up a
part of the 4th Ward.'The
high voter turnout was very
encouraging to all the
members. stafﬁng the areas.

“There are a tremen-
dous amount of voters here
today,” said 7th District
Judge of Election Blithe
Runsdorf. “We didn’t even
break a hundred last year 

right now, we’re already at
240 voters.” The 7th and
8th District polls were
located in Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall.
And in the 14th District,
located in Forbes Quad,
124 voters of the approxi-
mately SOO registered for
that district had already
voted by 1:15 pm.
“Normally, we’d only
have about half of that
amount for the whole day,”
said 14th District Judge of
Election Camille Calienda.
She went on to project
that her district will proba-
bly have a three-fourths
turnout by the time the

polls closed. ,
Though the numerous
polls were scattered

throughout Oakland, the
overall atmosphere at the

different areas was pretty
much uniﬁed.

“[Student voters] have
their minds pretty much
made up when they come
in,” said Stella Gentile,
15th District judge of elec-
tions at 16 Oakland Square.

Students coming out .

from behind the curtains
had a variety of reasons for
showing up to cast their
ballot despite the light driz-
zle and grey skies.

Stephanie Sudzina, a '

‘University Democrat who
was passing out campaign
literature at the door of
Soldiers and Sailors, said
she voted because she
believes in President
Clinton and didn’t want to
be labeled as a Generation
X-er who is apathetic.

Victory 

DeCoursey, political
Western Pennsylvania for the
Clinton/Gore campaign. “About a year
ago, people would have said this was
impossible. We’ve proven them
wrong.” ,

Democratic leaders at the festivities
professed gratitude to the many volun-
-teers who helped make the Democratic
campaigns in Pennsylvania and
throughout the nation a success.

“The Democrats‘ forgot about the
grassroots organizations for along
time,” Curran said. “But this campaign,
we returned to it, and it made a huge
difference.”

DeCoursey said grassroots organi-
zations were what won the presidential
election this year and stressed the
importance of the average, everyday
citizens working to support the many
Democratic campaigns.

director of

“Labor has been incredible, and it‘

has been fantastic how the numerous
unions have banded together to form a
wonderful support base for the presi-
dent,” DeCoursey said. .

The Democratic political fervor
extended to local party leaders like
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy.

“Isn’t this a great victory for
America today and for Western
Pennsylvania?” asked Murphy, who
received a thunderous answer of “Yes!”
from the crowd. “Look around you, at

 

FROM PAGE 1

the old and the young people present.
Look at all the diversity around you.
This is what makes the Democratic
party special. This is what makes
America special.” _

Murphy went on to declare the
importance of all young Democrats who
volunteered with the national and local
elections and applauded their efforts.

One such person, Paul McKre1l,
president of Pitt’s University
Democrats, was overjoyed at the num-
ber of Democratic victories.

“This isexactly how I expected it,”
said McKrell. “The people of America
have looked at Clinton’s record and
plan for the next four years, and they
believe that Clinton is the candidate that
will lead them into the next century.”

Rob Frank, the group’s vice presi-
dent, agreed. “Once again, the young
people of America have chosen their
destiny and rejected the negative
rhetoric of our Republican opposition,”
he said. “They said it couldn’t be done,
and we did it.”

In all of the excitement at last
night’s festivities, one mood prevailed

over all: dedicated support of the presi-_

dent.

up for the American people,”
DeCoursey said. “A president who did
not back down, and the people have
thanked him for it.”

Republicans

A portive until the very end, but not

every loyal party member had the
same false hopes that Dole would
win. Mark Kobell said that, despite
the fact that he supported Dole, he
felt Clinton would win all along.

“I feel happy that, the
Republican Party is branching out a
lot, but Dole’s effort was probably
too little too late,” he said.

Once the faithful began to real-
ize that it truly was over, they
resorted to attacking Clinton’s char-
acter even in defeat.

“After Ken Starr gets done with
his investigation Al Gore will be
our next president . and not Bill
Clinton,” said Mike Connell, a
Republican supporter at the party.

Martin Macky, an 83-year old
who has voted’ for every Republican
in every election since he was able
to vote, thinks this will be a wake-
up call to the nation.

“The American people for some
unknown reason don’t see all the
wrongdoings in Clinton’s presiden-

 

FROM PAGE I 

cy,” said Macky. “When they find
their president spending more time
in court than in the White House,
then maybe they’ll realize. But it
will be too late.”-

President Clinton will have
made history by the time this elec-
tion is completely over. He will be
the first Democrat to be sworn in
for a second term as president since
Franklin Roosevelt. _

“Even if they win the big one,
we still will have the Congress,”

. said Bill Zimmerman at the Fisher

party. He was speaking about the
prediction that crossed the televi-
sion screen ‘that the Republicans
would keep control of at least one
house, if not both by a slim margin.

“As long as we can keep
[Clinton] in check, we haven’t lost
everything,” said Macky. “Politics
is a funny thing — even if you lose,
there are still good points. I-just
hope our best interests are protected
by’ the Congress — it’s, our only
hope.” ’ .

Student affairs ets ale

to hear campus concerns

_ Jaime Leach

 

If you have questions, comments,
or suggestions about life at‘ Pitt, the
Office of Student Affairs wants to hear
from you. . ‘

Beginning Wednesday, Nov. 6, the
Office of the Vice Chancellor and other

members of ' the Student Affairs
Division will be setting up an inforrna—
tion table in the William Pitt Union.
The table will be staffed Wednesdays
from 11:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. and is
the brainchild of Robert Gallagher,
interim. vice chancellor for student

' affairs..

Gallaghersaid the table is an exper-

' iment in, “making student "affairs acces-

sible and visible.” The information
table is, at the moment, a trial to see
whether students respond_to this oppor-
tunity to voice their opinions.
Representatives from student
affairs will answer questions about

. areas such as the Office of International

Services, University Placement, and the
Learning Skills Center.‘ But, Gallagher
said, “it would be wonderful” if‘ stu-
dents raised concerns about programs
they would like to see offered or
changed. _ .

The idea for the information table
came about because of the success of
the Depression Screening Day, held by
the University— Counseling Center.
Gallagher said a ‘p‘a fairly large number
of-students were made aware that ser-
vices were available” because of the
program.

By. having an information table,
Gallagher said he hopes the program
will reach out to more students and help
the student affairs office keep in touch
with the opinions of the undergraduate
population. ,

The Student Affairs Division has
also established an e—mail Address:
SAFFAIRS@VMS.ClS.PITT.EDU.
Students are encouraged to send their
questions and comments to this address
at anytime. ’

SGB pushes for more recycling in dorms

B th+F' h  

 

. If SGB’s Environmental Committee
gets its way, recycling in the residence halls
should be on the rise soon.

Members of the committee met with
housing’s Assistant -General Manager Gil
Schaeﬂ’er yesterday to propose a plan to col-
lect recyclables from the residence halls
themselves. '

“They want to step up our current pro-
gram and increase awareness,” said
Schaeffer, who said he would‘ support the
program.

Schaeﬂ’er said that the current recycling
program was not entirely eﬂ°ectiv_e because
students are not always ‘cooperative about
putting things in the right container.

The Environmental Committee plans

A A on joining forces with the Student Volunteer

Outreach Center in making collections.
“We would do it once a week, and Pitt’s
Recycling Coordinator Greg Garvin has said

that he could get us a vehicle to take the recy— «

clables to the plant,” said Laura Frecon,
Environmental Committee chairperson.
Frecon said her committee would also

need the help of RSA and resident assistants ‘

in bringing recyclables to a central location
in each residence hall.

Getting approval from the Oﬂioe of
Residence Life is the next step in the plans
for the program, but no one from that oﬂice
could be reached for comment yesterday.
The proposed program would at ﬁrst include
only the Towers until logistics are worked
out, Frecon said.

To spread the word about this and other .

issues, the committee will also begin pub-
lishing a monthly newsletter starting this
month. It will include updates and plans
from the committee itself, as well as from the
Student Environmental Action Coalition.
Tips on recycling in the residence halls,
adages, and poetry will also be included, said
Frecon.

“It’s very hard to be environmentally
friendly in the dorms right now,” said
Frecon. “Our main goal is making students
aware of environmental issues,” she said.

One of the committee’s other major pro-
jects is the development of a “mug system”
that will cut down on the use of disposable
cups among the University community.

“One of our committee members dis-
covered that medium—sized cups alone gen-
erate 11.5 bags of garbage each day at
Eddie’s,” said Frecon.

The committee has drafted a letter ask-
ing local businesses to participate in the pro-

ject by giving a discount to students who use

the mugs. In exchange, the restaurants and
stores would receive free advertising on the
mug. ‘
“Greg Garvin has agreed to purchase
the mugs with a grant Facilities
Management received to promote recy-
cling,” explained Frecon.

The mugs would be given out to stu-
dents at the Earth Day celebration in April.
Frecon said the committee’s main reason for

' trying to get businesses to offer a discount

was to promote the use of the mugs among
students. " .

Polls .

“I feel that it’s the duty of every
American to get out and make a choice,”
said Andy Wuertele, SGB president, as he
emerged from making his vote. “Students
should deﬁnitely realize the importance of
getting out there and making a decision.”

That wasn’t the case for a great deal of
the voters who turned out. An overwhehn—
ing majority of the students turned out
because they felt it was their civic duty to
vote, but they said they were still undecid-
ed about who they’d be pulling the lever
for in a couple of minutes.

“I feel bad letting a presidential elec-
tion go by without voting,” said Lynn
Farbotnik as she approached the sign—in
table, still undecided. -

Though’ they did acknowledge the

ROM PAGE 

 

large turnout, many of those who staffed
the polls sensed that students were con-
fused when they went in.

“A lot of [students] come in and don’t
know what they’re doing when they vote,”
said Joseph Richardson, the 8th Disuict
judge of election. “A lot of them are just
voting one party straight to get in and out
of here quickly.” - ‘

Outside, many student voters walked
out showing their frustrations at not having
been able to learn enough about all the can-
didates in their busy lives.

“I voted all Democrat because I like
the majority of them, and it’s the easier
thing to do,” said CAS undergraduate
Jonna Buger.

Some students here at Pitt weren’t
even able to vote because of problems with
registering on time or obtaining absentee
ballots, despite campus-wide efforts to

THE Pl'l"l' NEWS

avoid this.

But as the day wore on, it was clear
that the parties had achieved the goal of
getting students out to vote. ‘ I

Wuertele said that the SGB has exert-
ed a lot of energy trying to_ get students to
register. He spoke about efforts to reach out
to students earlier in the year in freshman
studies classes and by bringing in MTV’s
“Choose or Lose” bus.

Even those who were able to vote by
absenteeballot were slightly disappointed
because they couldn’t take part at the
polling places.

Matt Murray, a GSPIA student who I

had already voted by absentee ballot said
he felt that he was removed from the whole
election day excitement and energy. .

‘ ‘‘I’ve already cast my ballot for the

’ people in my district, so I’m spoken for,”

he said. “It feels weird.”

Kudos, Bill - now you can
get some real work done

Congratulations, Bill: you’ve come a long way, baby.
You faced down Bob Dole. Now even he must say, “You
know it, lknow it, and the American people know it. Bill
Clinton is the president. Congratulations.” Not that we didn’t
know you had it in you to win reelection, but two years ago
when the Republicans regained control of both the House of
Representatives and the Senate, we will admit that we were
more than a little worried. -

However, you did it. You were the comeback kid and th
odds on favorite to win reelection. Now, you get to enjoy a
term in which you will not have to worry about getting
reelected. You can now sit back and enjoy the powers and
prestige that go along with the office of the president. No

longer will you need to watch the polls for your popularity. ,

No longer will you have to worry about whether or not your

policy initiatives will result in a loss at the election booth.
Now it’s time to really get crackin’. What we’d really

like to see from you is a comprehensive plan in which high-

. er education is govemmentally funded. Education should be

free to all of those who wish to obtain it and are willing to put
in the work to see it through. Education should not be an elit-
ist principle, and now you have the time and the I-don’t-ever-
have-to—run-again freedom to do something about it. How
many problems in this country could be solved if we had bet-
ter—educated citizens? There is only one way to ﬁnd out:
through trying it.

All the heat you took while trying to institute universal
health care doesn’t matter anymore. That’s right, it just does-
n’t matter. Go ahead and give it another try. You ran in 1992
on the platform that universal health care was necessary; now
make it a reality. What have you got to lose?

Sometimes driving to or from

__school, 1 see that British Airways plane,

regular as 4 p.fn. every day, ﬂying low
over I-279 and bringing who knows
who from London to Pittsburgh. As a
citizen of the world, I love to watch that
plane come in; in fact, I often wish I was
leaving on it. But in lieu of that happy
day, letme tell you about the problems
of entertaining other visitors who are on
it and relying on me to show them a
good time.

I The responsibilities of a reluctant
hostess are hampered indeed by the
awkward choices of season my visitors
have sprung on me. If you agree with
me that October is the hands—down pret-

tiest month and that August and January
are the hands—down worst, you will

understand the problems which I had‘

last August and the problems which I
anticipate in January. Although I really
want people to visit me, I also feel
responsible for their enjoyment and
even‘ the most loyal Pittsboiger will
surely‘agree, August and January are
respectively a bit problematic in the
entertainment area. A
When my brother landed that killer
job with a jeans manufacturer last sum-
mer, and he and his wife and kids were
in San San Francisco for a couple of
months, they were feeling so ﬂush that
they paid for me to go out there and visit
them in their panoramic view bayside
apartment. The only awkward part of
the deal was that my sister-in-law felt
that the ties of family responsibility
meant that she, along with my two
nephews, should return to -Pittsburgh
with me in order to take a. sample read-

Iiangri-La, but I can dream

ing of poor p.r.’s Pittsburgh Life.
~ How embarrassing! Pittsburgh in
August, and in direct comparison with
San Fran, what am I supposed to do to
entertain these well meaning and wel-
come relations? Actually, one of the ﬁrst
things I did was use my brother’s new
American Express card to buy some
more fans for my house, sotheir pallid
English ﬂesh wouldn’t melt in the heat.
So you can see why I’ll never make
' Martha’s Stewart’s list of hostesses with
the mostesses. (

Perhaps my youngest nephew had
the right idea as we boarded the plane in
San Fran. While waiting quietly in line
at Gate 20, Concourse B, young
Nicholas decided to remove his thumb
from his mouth in order to informus,
along with the other passengers (and at
a volume which competed with sonic
boom for sheer eardrum piercing
power), “Aaaagh! I don’t want to get on
the'plane!” This wouldn’t be so bad, but
then his mother, trying to quiet him with
the rational approach, validating his
feelings, etc. (see what even two months
in California can do to you?), said,
“Why, Nicholas, it’s perfectly all right.”
To which young Nicholas unhesitating-
ly corrected his mother at the same deaf-
ening volume, “Aaaagh! NO, NO, I
don’t want to get on the plane

BECAUSE it’s going to cra-a—a-aSH!” ‘

It didn’t crash, but Nicholas vali-
dated his own feelings as we drove
home one day from Wal—Mart. His
brother ’ dutifully ‘read the, sign,
“Welcome to Pennsylvania, America
Starts Here.” Nicholas put his hands
over his eyes and remarked, at normal
volume and to no-one in particular, “I
don’t want to go to Pennsylvania.”
Since driving home from Wal-Mart was

the height of the aftemoon’s entertain-
ment, you can hardly blame the boy.
Now another good friend of mine

\ .

has rashly decided to accept my oﬂ°er-of '

some R and R on me and take the
British Airways plunge (we hope not) to
our dear-little provincial enclave. Only
this is worse! He is_coming in January!
Now, I feel there is about the same level
of choice between August and .January
in Pittsburgh as there is between say,
death by electrocution and death by

‘ lethal injection. Either sweltering or
freezing, blinded by sunlight or by"

blinded by snowglow, impossible to
dress scantily enough on the one hand
and impossible to dress warmly enough
(and still remain mobile) on the other.
And so what am I to do to compete with
my jetsetting family and friends who
choose to visit me in my humble abode?
To make matters worse, this new
guest will coming to visit me after visit-
ing another friend of ours who happens
to live in Spain on the Costa Del Sol.
They called me last week from Carey’s
car phone, saying breezily that they
were driving down to the ocean in his
convertible, and wasn’t it too bad that I
couldn’t join them?So you can see that
my visitors all have the unfortunate
habit of visiting humble me in humble
Pittsburgh after jetting around to some
of the prettiest parts of the globe. And
I’ve already told you about my neigh-
borhood, in the backyard of a steel mill
with my neighbors who all have con-
federate ﬂags still discernible upon the
rusted rear ends of their trucks, and
bumper stickers which read things like
“Criminals Prefer Unarmed Victims.”

Finally, a vote
that counts

 

Voters, congratulations. Your ‘civic duty

As happy or sad as that makes you, yes-

' when you compare it to the vote in Chicago

today.
In Chicago today, the major league
baseball owners will be discussing, and pos-

sibly voting on, a new labor deal. The out- -

come, unlike Tuesday’s outcome, is much
too close to call.

Twenty-two owner “ayes” are needed
to pass ﬂremeasure. Twenty-one owners

‘ have publicly supported it. The other eight I

are undecided, and nearly all are slowly
crawling toward the “nay” side of the voting

' booth

It looks simple enough: if the majority

‘ gets its way, there will not be a strike in base-

ball for the life of the new contract." No more
World Series cancellations. No more record-
breaking seasons left hanging because
Donald Fehr said so. Sounds nice.

If the “gang of eight” stick together, a
strike is likely to break the minute after the
voting. The start of the season will be in
jeopardy, there will be more court cases, and
the owners will likely hang the members of
their negotiating team. Worse, most of this

' mob is made up of big-money owners who

want to steer clear of baseball-saving mea-
sures like salary caps and other revenue-bal-
ancing taxes. Sounds tenible..

choice to make: he or she’ must support the
minority owners.

That’s right, the minority owners. Stick
with me. '

Beasley gets a kick out of Pitt

Patrick Robertson

Although the University of Pittsburgh
Lady Panthers have had a rough season,
they do have some stars on their team who
will be a big help in the future.

One of these stars is Megan Beasley,
who leads the team in goals, assists, shots,
and points. She is also one of two Panthers
who came from Colorado to play for Pitt.

One of the main reasons Beasley
‘decided to attend Pitt was Head Coach

Roland Sturk, her Junior Olympics’ coach.

At the end of last year Sturk was named

head coach of the new Lady Panthers soc-
‘ cer team.

Beasley said, “He [Sturk] coached my
ODP [Olympic Development Program]
team. I got to know him there. I liked his
style and was impressed by his coaching
abilities.” ‘ I

When it came time to make her deci-
sion, Beasley said, “What the heck? A
coach is a big part of going to college and
playing soccer.” _

Not only did Beasley want to play for
Roland Sturk, but Sturk wanted Beasley
just as badly as a building block for his new
team. He recruited her. heavily, and she
made the decision to take on the responsi-
bility of starting a team from scratch.

“She was a state—level player,” he said.
“I saw potential, and, she was a driven kid
with a passion for the game. She was over-
looked by many coaches. They felt she
couldn’t blossom to her full extent.”

' Her coach disagreed with these other
coaches, and his opinion has paid off. Sturk

believes that with a little work and improve-
ment in the team, she could become a top
player at the collegiate level.

Pitt luckily got Beasley before
Colorado University, University of
Northern Colorado, and a small school in
South Carolina had the chance to sign the
little-known star. _ - A
_ She said, “I liked the campusand all
the school had to oﬂ°er.”

Beasley brought thecampus and the
team a little something as well, as she has
chipped in ﬁve goals and ﬁve assists for the
Lady Panthers. '

 

Beasley said  the fact that this is a '

ﬁrst year program did not really make a dif-
ference, but then she went on to say, “I’d
come in and get a starting position.”

She knew that she could make an
impact immediately. She also lmew it was a
chance for her to have her name in the
record books.

Beasley has had to make a‘ very fast
adjustment from high school soccer to the
collegiate level.

She said, "The college game is a lot ‘

strange, strange business. Owners complain
about money problems while players get

“lesser of two evils” to a new level.

Also like politics, there are often hidden

was also a vote for higher taxes, decreased

was a vote for, well, I only have so much

there will not be interleague play next sea-

proposed 1997 schedule,- which would
match only the American League East with
the National League East, and so forth.
‘That would mean uneven scheduling

this scenario: The Pirates and the Phillies are
in a wild—card race." The Phillies have to

‘swing by. New York and Baltimore late in

the year, while the Pirates are blessed with

To stop this, we have to put our faith in

the greed of the eight owners willing to risk

a damaging strike (which won’t‘ happen

that easy for Meinhart. She is gradually
getting used to the city atmosphere. Her
hometown is small —— barely visible on
a map. An athlete’s schedule is always

busy, and Meinhart’s is no exception. ’

VV1th a heavy load in chemistry, physics,
and calculus, plus practice, she rarely
has any ﬂee time.

“I’m getting used to the city atmos-
phere, but it was a little hard at first I
don’t get to go out and experience the
city as much as I would like to,” said
Meinhart. , , '

Meinhart is rare in that she not only

. received a full ride for volleyball, but

also from the engineering school. She
received both scholarships but decided

‘ to come to Pitt on the academic scholar-

ship.

This is not only a tremendous and
unheard of accomplishment for an ath-
lete, but it helps the team by saving a
scholarship for another player.- So, in
theory, the team could have another
scholarship player that they wouldn’t
have been able to have, because of
Meinhart.

“She is one of those rare athletes.

’ She was interviewed for the Chancellor

scholarship. That’s how far and above
she is academically,” said Alvear.

'  FROM PAGE 8

Meinhart has a quiet and reserved
persona. She is not easily annoyed and
has a laid back outlook on life. Known
as the quiet girl in the back of the team
van, Peggy is more of an observer and
evaluator. Alvear admits she has a
humorous side if listened to.

“Peggy is known on the team as one '

of those girls that if you really listen to
her you’re going to pick up a really good
one—liner. She’s very witty,” said Alvear.

Meinhart grew up in a large and
athletic family. Her three brothers were
all involved in athletics. Her parents

_were supportive of her athletics, but

never pushed her.

“They were great parents. They
showed support and were happy when I
won, butthey would never be down on
me for losing. They added no extra pres-
sure,” said Meinhart.

. In the future, Meinhart has dreams
of the Olympics and of being an engi-

neer. VV1th the way she has started her

college career, these dreams are very
attainable.

“We have a number of one-in—a-
million kids, and Peggy is deﬁnitely one
of them. I couldn’t ask any more of what
she is doing athletically and academical-
ly,” said Alvear.

‘ She has adjusted well, but is not at the
star level Coach Sturk alluded to earlier.
Through the year, the soccer team has
hurt itself with bad passes and physical mis-
takes. , .
To keep herself optimistic through this
ﬁrstseason, Beasley says to herself, “We’reg

. only a ﬁrst year team, and [Sturk] only had

a half a year to recruit.” .

Also, she says she sees hope in the fact
that toward the end of the season her team
has been in games, and they have been
steadily improving. She says she’s looking
forward to a huge improvement for next
year with the inﬂux of new recruits and the
experience that this year’s team gained.

.‘ For her to improve, Beasley believes
she must get faster and stronger. She says
that she also must adjust .-to the whole col-

lege game and improve her leadership skills. _

Sturk says, “She’ll only get better. She
will be able to compete favorably with the
Big East competition. She will not get over-
whelm .” '

This is a testament to her talent and

Look for Megan Beasley to do good
things in the future with the rest of this very
