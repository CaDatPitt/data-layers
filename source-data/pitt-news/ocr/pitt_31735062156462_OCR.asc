Bob Timmons, Pitt’s new head basketball coach, has
been foreign to the ﬂoor sport for seven years, but the
__40-year old football end coach still knows his way around.
' ‘After the announcement yesterday morning that Tim-
monshad signed a three-year contract to replace Dr. H. C.
Carlson who stepped down as coach eleven days ago, he
was quite ‘willing to tell the News what kind of system
Pitt students will see in the Field House next season.

“I have always used the fast- 5

break attack,” Bobby said, “and
against a man-for-man ’defense
I resort,to a ﬁgure-eight style
offense. If the defense uses a
zone, naturally, we’ll overload
a~zone and shoot allot of sets.
“I’m looking forward to this
challenggﬁand relish getting back
into basketball. I’ve always liked
basketball as a sport,” Timmons
said, “and in time I hope to cre-
ate a livelier interest among stu-
dents.”

Likely ODK Candiddles  

Topicof Speculation

_- By DAVE GREEN ~
'.L'ap Day ceremonies Wednesday will reveal which senior
man will receive the most coveted of awards bestowed upon

student leaders at Pitt-—The Omicron Delta Kappa Man of

the Year award.

At the end of reading of a long list of tappees to the
activities honoraries, Dean Biddle will open an envelope and

read the name of the individual whose name will be inscribed

in ODK walk as representative of the ‘type of male student

that Pitt tries to produce.

As usual, rumors have circu-
lated on the eighth ﬂoor since the
naming of last year’s awardee
about who would get it Wednes-
day. Of the outstanding graduat-
ing seniors however, a few names
stand out as good possibilities.

Marasco Possibility

Heading the list of possibilities-
is Joe Marasco, this year’s presi-
dent of ODK. Marasco served as
chairman of the gigantic Religion-
In-Life ‘conference here for two
years. He held leadership positions
in the YMCA and his fraternity,
and this year was chairman of
the Student Congress social com-
mittee. His Q.P.A. borders 2.8‘.

Marasco’s chief rival, in the
opinion of many,—gis,
of -111 3*. Cbuncil-.7 president ..Lugl-

on Men’s council and has been an

outstanding member of the Pitt
band.

president and SC appointments

among the other contenders for
the honor. Other possibilities"-are
Morton Goldstein, spring carnival
chairman and MC vice-president.
Lloyd Fuge, YMCA president, and
Art Boyd, varsity basketballer are
not to be counted ,out. '

Since men who are not mem-
bers of ODK are also eligible for
the honor, Jack Burwinkel, pres-
ident of Student Congress might

‘ of the article “Why Did Doc ‘Resign?’ ” written by Pitt
News editor John Kulamer for the “Panther” magazine.

In the release, Kulamer implied that press releases on ‘

Dr. H.‘ C. Carlson’s resignation were \ “trumped, up.” Ac-

Mabel Jackson, Col. ’54-—-“If the

Tom Foley, Col. ’54-—“The ar-

Myra Wilson, Ed. ’53-—-“I don’t

has too much individuality to let
anyone sway him.” "

Judy Cohen,’ Col. "54 —— “The
facts should be investigated so
that the student body knows what
to believe.” '

Art Hershkowitz, Engr. ’53—
“I-lamilton probably forced Carl-
son into a position whereby he
either had, to ‘resign . or continue
coaching mediocreiteams. Natur-
ally, Carlson won’t admit it.”

Jim Liatta, Col. ’56—‘-‘I think
Doc Carlson resigned, and for the
same reason that caused Jock
Sutherland to ‘resign-—not enough
scholarships. T h e r e f o r e , good
players aren’t attracted to Pitt.”

Bea Paul, Col. ’53'—“Doc’s rec-i

ord speaks for itself. In spite of all
the pros and cons, he’ll go down
in Pitt history as one of the
school’s most beloved .members.”
Dick Roman, Col. ’54-—“‘Doc’s
resignation came .about due to
pressure from oﬁicials in Pitt’s
athletic ' department, who realized
that Dr. Carlson’s usefulness as
a basketball coach
expired.”

fSiIppart_ b y Industry   

Two stories appearing in the last’ issue of the Pitt News

,_ ‘:_poin__t. up a trend that is becoming more noticebale as the
_ years go? by. One story revealed that local industry has
',_nearly reached itsgoal of $7,500,000 to be contributed as

its share of the cost of the new medicaland nursing build-

1 ings. Alan M. Scaife announced at a dinner. Monday night

that $6,-177,000 has so far beenlsubscribed. The other item

 indicated that Pitt is included in a list of 45 institutions eli-
.’ gible to receive aid from? the Bethlehem Steel Company, for
j ,’the _training of company-picked graduates in a special ‘job-
-:_{training program. Bethlehem makes $3,000 available for
 the-_trainin'g of each student selected, andithere are more
S"than-.100 such men absorbed in the program each year.
'. This addsup to more than $300,000 annuallythat Bethle-
 hein is investing in higher education. , ’ . '
-— M’ These two stories emphasize the increasingly important
~*',rol,e business and industry have played in recent years

in ‘supporting education at the upper levels. This is a

5f _ ’ healthy state’ of aaffirs, and is no doubt making the overall
  problem of ﬁnancing the nation’s universities a lot easier.
W _*_But» there are drawbacksn ’ ‘L L 

Quite naturally, businessmen like to see an. immediate

i return on the money they donate to the schools, with the

result that such money is "directed almost exclusively to-

 ward the development and expansion of those departments‘

j._ that will send ftrained graduates directly into the business
.  world,,or industry itself. The result has been an increasing-
: p emphasis, here*and elsewhere, on~professional and technical

 training schools -that are directly‘ or indirectly concerned,
;_ with business and industry. ‘ The corollary to this is that
 there has been proportionate decrease inzemphasis, devel-
’ — opment—wise, in the liberal arts and "other non-technical

‘branches of education. Liberal. arts schools ha«ve’been for

 the most part ignored by industry when" handing out ﬁnan-
.~ _«ci_al support in favor of the more directly proﬁtable invest-.
 mentein the technical and professional schools.

- ‘We hopethat someday industrial leaders will become
fuly aware: of the long range beneﬁts of an annual healthy

,. ,,cr.op~ of well-educated liberal arts students, and begin to
-support that side of education in the same measure that

they are now supporting the other. That a good. sprinkling
of broadly-educated people are as important to our way of

.¥.life as the many technical personnel has been acknowledged
- ,by most, but apparently those with the biggest bankrolls
_ have been unable to see it yet as a good investment. Until V

A ‘they do, liberal arts here and elsewhere will continue to

languish.

Six Schooglsi Rated as Topssfo

' By ﬁ|_i_nore Stone

If you’re interestedin being a‘

really true scholar there are only
a certain few colleges in the

. United -States. you should attend.

At least, Mademoiselle Magazine,
which has. recently published a
report of a study made on this
point, says as much.

It is the ﬁrst, publication of —-

any kind to round-up such ﬁnd-
ings, especially as they relate to
the education of women. The
, study was made to discover the
so-called “fountains of scholar-
ship” or top schools in the coun-
try in the production of scholars.
According to them, the top six
women’s colleges in this aspect
are Bryn Mawr, Barnard, Rad-

cliife, Vassar, MacMurray and_

Mount Holyoke.
Special Distinction _
“Six co-ed colleges," Made-
moiselle continues, “have a spe-
cial distinction and point to a
certain kind of atmosphere that’s
favorable to learning .' . . The
six co-ed colleges are Swarth-

more, Read, University of Chi-’

cago, Oberlin, Carleton and An-
tioch.” -

At these schools, the report

 Something to Consider

To date, fortunately, the mat-

Safety Director Fairley and the ’

,act, however, they might con-

sider some of the practices which
Pitt students feel are injustices

« to them.

— In the ﬁrst place, employees of
the Carnegie Library could hard-

sly be justiﬁed in requesting short

time. parking, since they, like
Pitt students; would have to park
in the Plaza all day. .

As far as the patrons of the
library are concerned, there are
already a large number of park-
ing spaces on the street between
the Plaza and Schenley bridge
reserved foritwo hour‘ parking,
and the "time rule is enforced
rigidly by police. '

to consider restricting parking in
Oakland, they might do well to
question «the practices of the

freshman psychology that you

4can’t use the ‘same measure.

The English course is probably

attended“ by people who have
proved they can write. They are
all a select group. Some are a
little better than others so some
measure is needed, but seldom
will you ﬁnd a class which breaks
down into even three separate
groups.
' On the other‘ hand the psy-
chology class is huge, and proba-
bly contains students of varying
ability. The main learning is a
set of facts. It is very easy to set
up a scale and award a grade ac-
cording to how many_facts each
student absorbed.

Different Story

On this basis an “A” in one
course means something quite

different than an “A” in another —

course.'The grade a student gets
in a course tells you quite well
where he, stands in that course
and that is all it tells. QPA’s are

from averaging acres,’ quarts and

ounces.

The fact is that people do pay
attention to QPA’s. Perhaps
wh\at is needed is a propaganda-

try and Carleton’s has been cap-
tained in recent years by‘students
who “obviously don’t give all

their time to the game——two Phi ~
Beta Kappas and one Rhodes

Scholarship winner.”

In addition,’ “none of these
schools has national sororities . . .
all are privately controlled and
non-denominational . . .. all are
interracial and nonsegregated.”

All of which, is very interest-
ing.

Prof Hater?

If_ you happen to hate, pro-
fessors, here’s a bit of happy
news. ‘A columnist for the
Plainsman, Alabama Polytechnic
Institute, has started what he
calls the “I Hate Professors”

~ club, and he invites all interested

parties to join. The rules, he
says, are.quite simple, and you
need only follow “the ones
adaptableto your special talent.”
Here are a few: . A

half the time. When entering a
classroom late, glare at the pro-

fessor and insinuate _ that he .
, started the class ten minutes

early.

They come about

     

ordinances in the Plaza.
Cops Mean Business

Most students have come to
know better than park outside
the white lines drawn on the
Plaza surface. They’ve learned
the hard way that the cgps mean
business where the no parking
signs are posted.

   ......e....p....aneM...

The gendarmes seem ‘deter-.

mined to enforce legal parking
in the area, except when there’s
a ball game in "Forbes Field.
Then they actually direct traﬁic
into the driveways of the parking

lot until the whole expanse is '

parked solid.‘ The student who
ﬁnishes school in the middle of
the afternoon often ﬁnds him-
self sewed up tight in a sea of
cars‘parked bumper to bumper
with no room in between, yet
nobody gets tagged. But let some
unwary student park his car out-

side the neatly marked squares
when there’s no game and he’s'

got a two buck ticket to see the
judge. '

City Council’s time would be
better spent if its concern was
for improvement, not restriction
of student‘ parking in Oakland.

discontinuing of their use to de-
termine eligibility for all sorts of
academic prizes. A better meas-
ure which is used fairly often is

a general knowledge exam like '

the national teachers exam.

Graduate schools use this
method of evaluation in their
comprehensive exams for the
M.A. and the Ph.D. These are
unfair to students in subjects
like speech and composition, but
there are other kinds of exams
which can be given them.

Not Much Use

Comprehensive exams are not
of much use for a single semester
course, but they can be used to
grade people who have taken the
same general course of study
'over a long period of time. ‘

Nothing can really be done to
make grades in different subjects

compare with one another. A‘

grade will enable a person to
-understand where ‘he stands in

relation to the others in his class,.

but that is about all. Any at-

tempt to make grades compara- ‘

ble such as the universal use “of
the normal curve will only serve
to mask _the inherent ‘absurdity
of figures like the Q.P.A.

Embarrassing moments:

a few minutes late, threw off her

Big Moths from little Silkwoirxns 

 

NCE there was a Biology Professor named Charlie Edwards.

» Charlie was a likcablc chap, but the strain of marking

‘ exam: was a little too much for him. Finally, one day, he
completely ﬂipped his lid. Crawling onjhis belly, he informed
__startled students and faculty members alike that he was,

indeed, a silkworm!

He hurried to his room, grabbed a spool of silk thread, and
built a huge cocoon around him. Day after day he stayed in
his cocoon, repeating over and over,

‘‘I am a silkworm! I am a silkworm! I am a silkworm!”

The/ other members of the faculty held a meeting to decide
what was to be done with poor Charlie." “I’ve got it!”, cried
Bob Sutton, a physics instructor, leaping to his feet. He
explained his plan . . . and the other professors agreed. They

. hurried down to the ‘Van Heusen dealer and bought a few

Vanispun Sport Shirts.

“Look, Charlie,” they said to Professor Edwards. “These
smart new Van Hcusen Vanispun Sport Shirts look exactly
like silk. They feel like silk. The-y’re handsomely tailored in
the season’: smartest new colors. Yet they cost only $4.95
apiecea, . far less than silk sport shirts. So you see, you’rc.
wasting your time being a silkworm!”

Charlie Edwards peered over the top of his cocoon and

— examined the good-looking Van Heuscn Vanispun Sport Shirt.

“Egad, you’re right l”, he shouted, leaping out of his cocoon

and ﬂapping his arms wildly. “Now I can turn into a moth

and ﬂy away!"

Sarge Mitterling and his baseball Panthers are in An-
napolis today where they tangle with the Middiesto try to
extend their current win streak to six games

\ The Panthers, who have suddenly cauglht ﬁre during
the last few weeks, now’ boast a season’s record of six wins

and ﬁve losses. -

Doc Shanafelt, with a2-1 record, will st_art on the mound

for the Mittmen against the pow-
erful Middies. Shanafelt, who

treated Sarge to his ﬁrst no-hitter

as a»Pitt coach, will also add ex-

Shanafelt, during his "no-hit
performance, helped his own
cause by lining out ‘two doubles
and driving in three runsagainst

Today’s visit to the_;. Naval
Academy resumes the Pitt-Navy
series which ended in 1951 with
the Middies winning at Annapolis.
Coach Mitterling called today's
game a “tough one” since, as he
pointed out, Navy always has a
good ball .club. On the other hand,

Sarge’s team which hasn’t been

too bad lately, may be weakened
if second’ sacker Joe Scalzo is un-
able to play.
Scalzo Doubtful

, Scalzo, currently hitting..at“.286,
suffered a groin injury in Tues-
day’s game with Bethany. Doctors
report that Scalzo may play if the
injury is taped. Should the injury
bother Scalzo, though, Mitterling

‘will probably ﬁll in Frank Hunter

In my opinion the exclusion of Timmon’s name from ' the

Timmons was interviewed

by the group Monday night after ‘the recognition banquet. No
one knew for sure at the time if there was to be a meeting or

if» anyone would be interviewed.

By Wednesday .Timmons had been picked and only the an-
nouncement remained’. to complete the. perfect screen play.

Mostly everyone ,was off base in their personal choices for the
.post. But the so—called observers who “just knew thatan outsider
'- would be picked” have the réddest faces of them all.

Candidates interviewed ﬁt. into only the first two groups:
(1) presentlstaff members and (2) Pitt alumni in the coaching
ranks. Oh yes, there was one more group-—thos_e who got lost.
