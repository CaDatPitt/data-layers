In Balancing Budget

By JOHN DAWSON,

The -Office of the Dean of
Students has set up a service
to“ help student organizations
manage their-ﬁnances.

Barbara L. Ginsburg, staff
assistant to the dean of stu-
'dents, will be the ﬁnancial ad-
VISEI‘.

“Many student o_r-ganizations

need to be more careful with their

money. They are not systematic,
especially in keeping records,”
Ginsbu‘r»g,said.. “This service can
also helpthem in making money
goafurther,” she added. _ - -

as a legal advisor, since she will.»

Each organization will be re-

which involves admission charges

The statement also said:.“Con-

Hope To End Segregation

By NATHAN FIRESTONE

Two negro students from
the South, John Parham and
John Mack, explained’ their
stand on the recent sit-down
strikes to a group of Univer-
sity students last Tuesday.

Both presented their opinions of
what the non-violent protests in
southern lunch counters would
accomplish.

By getting enough college stu-
dents to protest against these dis-
criminatory actions, they hoped to
end segregation in diners, and ev-
entually in other areas where
Negroes were not on an equal
footing with whites.

’ Reactions Questioned

After their talks tothe students

and a question and answertperiod,

, theyv were» asked exactly ;_how

they reacted when confronted by
segregation.

The ﬁrst question presented
was what their feelings were
when they walked into a segre-
gated bus and were told that
they must move to the rear.

Parham answered, “I have an
acute feeling of embarrassment
when I enter the bus and am told
that I can’t sit or stand up front,
although the bus is crowded and
it would be more convenient for
everybody for me to stay where
I am.” I ~

Moving Away

Both felt that it would be in-
advisable to allow their children
to grow up in such an environ-
ment. Mack said, “I couldn’t stand,
to have my children subjected to
this. I would want them to grow
up somewhere else. That’s why

phy from the University of South Africa will give his an-V 

swer to this question at the Midday Series-‘program on Wed-
nesday noon in the-~SU supper room. ~ "

’Yourgrau holds the chair of Cowling Professor of Ph_i-.-if

losophy at Carleton‘College, Min-°

nesota, duringwthis academic year.
Arriving in, America towards the
end of January, he was invitedas
research professor to the Minne-
sota Center for Philosophy of Sci-
ence. .

After his tenure. there, he taught
at New York University for‘ at
short while. It wasgon the advice
of Dr. Robert Oppenheimer that

Yourgrau emigrated to this coun-
try. For the second year he has

been made.a’ fellow of the B01-
lingen Foundation, - _
;He has published about 40

papers’ and review"s‘,7'and several 1

‘other of his lbooksvwillibe pub-
lished. by A-American and British

   

  

 

‘a - vman;;of --brilliance» -and»; astonish-
ing-‘ versatility. -His field .. is the
philosophy of science, but he is no
less skilled in literature’ and the
arts. .

“He was brought up bi-lingual-
ly‘ in French and German, and is
intimate with the literatures of

‘ both languages; and he is prac-

tically tri-lingual, so well is he
equipped in English literature. He
is a powerful and ebullient
speaker.”

Yourgrau was most recently en-
gaged in editing a book on the

philosophy’ of leading scientists. He
is known for his works on the
meaning and implications of exis-
tentialism and is considered an ex-
pert on Nietzsche. '

‘Sit-in’ Students Voice Opinions

where I ’won’t run into the same
type of problems that I encounter
down here. '

Perhaps I am being selﬁsh in
wanting to get away, but I feel
that I will be able to render a_
better service to my race if I
can get away for a few years
where I will have a real chance
to get a beginning in my work.

They were then asked how a
southern Negro ﬁrst feels when he
gets away from that type of at-
mosphere and comes to the North.

Feelings Mixed

Parham answered this question.
“My feelings were mixed when I
ﬁrst came up here. They were a
combination of anxiety, anticipa-
tion and curiosity. Here was
something I had always heard of
but had never had a chance to ex-
perience. up to now.

._ Symbol of Cultural Expression‘
 Arts Department Shows
   Diversified Programs

BY HARRY DEWINTER. —
“The purpose of the Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Depart-
ment,” according to Dr. Walter R. Hovey, headpof the depart-
ment, “is to work as a laboratory for understanding the

_,.works of art and as a means of helping an individual to dis-
‘cover his own innate, distinct desires in whatever ﬁeld he

chooses.”

The Fine Arts " Department
(comprised of the library, gallery
and exhibition room) conducts
special, lectures and lectures in
connection with exhibition dem-
onstrations. Art film programs
and student ﬁeld trips are also
features of the ,program.

“The Fine Arts Library,” stated

Dr. Hovey, “is separate from the

main university library. Many of

the books in our library are not

1'." listed in the card catalog__of the

' main library as many students

, seem to think. We are trying to
correct this situation, however.”

Orient Emphasized
The library collection contains
approximately 27,000 v o 1 u m e s,
with emphasis on the oriental
ﬁeld, 700 ‘color prints, 63,000
photographs and 24,000 slides. In
addition there_ are manuscripts
and drawing facsimiles, paintings
"and examples of ﬁne printing.
Commenting on the main
theme of the department, Dr.

Hovey said it “is a thing of art

as a reﬂection of ideas and as a

symbol of cultural expression.

The department offers to stu-

dents a diversiﬁed program. The

course approaches the study of
art from the humanistic and
practical viewpoint.

_ The studio courses, under Virgil
D. Cantini, provide experience in
many media for the ﬁne arts ma-
jor and the opportunity for all in-
terestedvstudents to learn funda-
mentals of various techniques,
whether it be in drawing, oil,
watercolor, charcoal, m o s a i c,
sculpture or fresco. I

Making Artists
Cantini has said that he “is not
trying to make artists of his stu-
dents,” but primarily “to acquaint
students of art history with the
thinking of'the artist and the pro-

 

 

blem . . . and difficulties which
arise while working in various
media.”

A new introductory art course
will be offered next trimester
which will take up the relation-
ship between arts and other sub-
jects, and point out the signifi-
cance of art to a society rather
than a study of art itself.

Also on the calendar for next
year is an exhibit of contempor-
ary tapestries of steel mills, using
industry as a theme for design.
In addition, rare books are sched-
uled for display, too. In the past
the Fine Arts’ Department has
held exhibitions ‘pertaining to
“Pittsburgh Artists of the Nine-
teenth Century,” in 1938.

Paintings Shown

“Old Pittsburgh” was featured
in 1941. and “Pittsburgh and Its
Rivers” in 1948. One man shows
.of”John Donoghy, Russel Smith
and Joseph R. Woodwell have also

i been featured.

In 1956, the department pre-
sented “Painters from Pitts-
burgh,” an exhibition of the
frontier settlement and indus-
trial developments. The “Twelve

6

Masterpieces of Italian Paint-
ing” from the 14th and 15th cen-
turies were displayed in the
Commons Room last December.
The Italian frescoes, from the
last exhibition will be ‘installed

permanently in the new Fine Arts , 2

building which is to be construct-
ed in the area adjoining Forbes
Field. The details of the structure
are still vague. The Building will
be a combination of library,
lecture hall and museum facilities
which will display objects of his-

torical art. Studos will also be in-

cluded.

Old Book Exhibit

DONNA STEPP sits in the Fine Arts gallery admiring one of the

old books in the exhibit on the seventh ﬂoor. The exhibit is one
of the various shows put on by the Fine Arts Department through-

out the year.

Ceneral Ridgway CivesRe’view

Of ‘The Longest Day’ ’by‘Ryan 

"General Matthew

By TRUDY WEISS
B. Ridgway analyzed Cornelius Ryan’s

”The Longest Day” for his ﬁrst book reviewbefore students,
faculty members, and guests of the University Wednesday

afternoon.

The book deals with-the invasion of Normandy during
World»War‘ II, and it was General Ridgway who led the air-

borne invasion on D-Day, the sixth¢

of June, 1944.

General Ridgway d e s c r i b e d
Ryan as a “delightful and’ fantas-
tic man.” The publishing of “The
Longest Day” ended ten years of
research on the part of the aulthor,
during which time Ryan inter-
viewed 600 German survivors as
well as countless Americans.

People's Story

General Ridgway recommends
Ryan’s book “not as a military ac-
count, but as the story of people.”
He read several passages which
describe the reaction of two im-
portant factions in the invasion:
the German military, and the
French villagers.

General Ridgway attributes

our success in completely sur- -

prising the Germans with this"
invasion to an “incredible ser-
ies of events,” favorable to the
Allies. ‘
Although Ridgway feels that
Ryan gives a thorough account of
D-Day, the general’s personal
comments based on first hand ex-

perience in the invasion made each_

scene come alive to his audience.

General Ridgway closed his re— '

View with comments on the world
situation today. He thinks that no
idea is more absurd than the idea
that war, if it comes to us, will be
short, an opinion which he be-
lieves is held by too many people.
' The general expressed his
opinion that it is tragically piti-
ful to think that the American
people would give up, so long as
any of them were left. “Things
that we enjoy as our heritage
are the things that are worth
ﬁghting for.” ’

The general had this to say
about , recent developments: “The
world is in a serious situation;
there are some ominous signs. But
we will certainly not precipitate
war.”

,1‘ Thinclads Beaten by Villanova;
if Panthers TakeTwo From State

By JACK Sh/IITH 9

A track meet with Villa-
nova 'wouldn’t be complete
without rhubarbs. This year
the decisions were given to
‘the Panthers but Villanova
easily rubbed out all judges’

 favors to win 79% to 51%
urday at the Stadium.

The ﬁrst dispute came 'in- the
staggered 440—yard run. Speedy
Mel Barnwell and Sophomore Ro-

/bert Raemore were both clocked
‘ in 47.8 but Barnwell was_ given
ﬁrst place. “That one makes up
:t for last year,” Wildcat Coach Jim

, Elliott said.
The second dispute came in the
220-yard dash. ‘Again Barnwell
’ was the runner in question. Villa-
“ n_ova’s Otis Drayton won the race
' in 21.3 but Barnwell and Francis

 

second. Again the Panthers gain-
.. ed the —long, end of the stick.
‘.‘Let’-s fact it, if the race is close
we might as well forget it,” Elliott
protested. Barnwell ' still ﬁnished
second. .
The disputes had little effect
on the outcome of the meet,
however, for Villanova’s sopho-
more studded thinclads proved
they had the depth as they con-
*“tinuaIly upset the Panthers in
jevents . w h e r e. the Panthers
seemed strongest. ’
t to The only double winner for the
 .- Panthers was Ron Rush who won

 

With no competition to push him

4 he ‘won the mile in 4:18.5 ‘and

 ca,,e back to win the two mile
with hurdles in 10:31.5.

TIL’L WE MEET AGAIN

Todlay I conclude my sixth year of writing columns for the
makers of Marlboro and Philip Morris cigarettes. It lias been
my custom during these six years to make no attempt to be
funny in this ﬁnal column. (I have\achieved this objective
many times dzgivzg the year also, but never on purpose.) The

you are preparing for/ﬁnal exams and, short of holding you
down and tickling yet, there is no way in the world to make you
laugh at this time; and, second, for many of us this is a”leave-
taking, and leave-takings, I think, ought not be ﬂippant.

If I have brought you a moment or two of cheer during the
past year,‘ I am rewarded. If I have persuaded you to try
Marlboro or Philip Morris cigarettes, you are rewarded. ‘

Let me pause here to express my heartfelt gratitude to the
makers of Marlboro and Philip Morris. They have given me
complete freedom inthe writing of these columns. There has
not been the slightest hint of censorship. They have never
changed so much as one comma in my copy. I wish to take this
occasion to state publicly that I am forever grateful to these

of columning, I shall require a substantial increase in salary. 
The money is not what matters—not as money, that is, but
only as a token. I want to be assured that they love’ me as
much as I love Marlboro and Philip Morris. And what,‘indeed,
is not to love? Marlboro is a cigarette which ‘proves beyond
pavil that ﬂavor did not go out when ﬁlters came in. Philip
Morris is a cigarette that is pure mildness from lip—cnd to tip-
end. Both of these estimable smokes come in soft-pack or
ﬂip-top box. Neither is ever sold in bulk. "

‘ The summer lies ahead. For underclassmen summer will be _
a hiatus, a breather in which to restore yourselves for next
year’s resumption of busy college life. For seniors there will
be no more college. You must not, however, despair and abandon

yourself to idleness. There are other things to do in the world
besides going to school—basket weaving, for example, or build-
ing boats in bottles, or picking up tinfoil, or reading “War and
Peace.” Many graduates fall into the erroneous belief that their
lives are over when they leave ‘college. This is not so. It is
possible to make some sort of life for yourself with a bit of
ingenuity . . . or, if that fails, dye your hair, change your name,
and enroll at some other college. A - '

Whatever the future holds for you, be assured that the makers

of Marlboro and Philip Morris join me in wishing you the best
of everything. We have taken great pleasure—-the makers and
I—in bringing you this column each week throughout the school
year. We hope a little pleasure has accrued to you too.

May good fortune attend your ventures. Stay happy. Stay
