‘°’PitfPoIice in Contract Fight  

BY DAN KOHUT

Campus Police may go to Federal
Court to force the University to
reopen negotiations on wages and
subcontracting, a campus police
union spokesmen said Wednesday.

Robert Kolsky, steward for the
Campus Police unit of Local 249
International Brotherhood of Team-
sters, said he plans to discuss a
Federal Court action, along with

other remedies, with attorneys.

from a law ﬁrm specializing in
‘rather relations next Monday.

tract private security guards and
refused to meet with the men after
they voted down a 40-cent hourly
increase for 1975-6, Kolsky said.

The union, according to Kolsky,
asked for a dollar-increase.

Pitt Labor Relations Specialist
Thomas C_herry denied the use of
threats in the bargaining talks.

Cherry said the University would
not totally eliminate the subcon-
tracting clause from the contract.

“We offered to put in a clause

strengthening their job security,”
Cherry said.

According to Kolsky, the Cam-
pus Police probably wouldn't walk
off the job if their demands were
not met immediately. “The
students and staff look to us for
safety and protection,” Kolsky
said. “We will not let them
down."

Kolsky said Cherry refused to
meet with the union after the police
voted down the 40-cent increase.

Cherry said he told the business
agent for Local 249 he did not
refuse to meet with representatives
of the Campus Police union. “I
was on vacation when they tried to
reach me,” Cherry said.

Kol-sky said that Cherry told
them in the meetint that it was the
intent of the University to eliminate‘
only four jobs. Those four will be
re-filled by private security guards.

Among those to be eliminated,‘

Kolsky said, is the officer assigned
to the Scaife loading docks,'who
directs traffic and must have a
police commission to do so, Kolsky
added. :3?

“Tiger” Paul Auslander, self-
appointed cheerleader for Pitt
basketball games the last three
seasons, has been banned by ‘the
athletic department from partici-

“Tiger Paul did a good job of
exciting the students -last year,”

said.

Since Auslander, known for his
‘unorthodox style, is not a cheer-
leader, a student or a player,
Myslinski said Pitt shouldnot use
him. “We are pushing our own

Kolsky said a shortage of

Kolsky said some posts, such as

times to cover shortages in other
lower crime areas, and not replaced
for that tour of duty.

SGB Allocates SCAR $30 T

BYBILL MOORE
An amount far smaller than the

V ‘ $500 allocation requested by Pitt

organizers of the Student Confer-
ence Against Racism (SCAR) was
ﬁnally approved in‘ a special
Thursday evening session of the
Student Government (SGB).
Following an hour-long dispute

- among Board members, it was

agreed unanimously to allocate $30
to allow one Board member to
attend the conference, which will
be‘ this weekend in Boston.

The dispute centered ‘around
Allocations Committee member
Patty Cooper's explanation that the
committee recommended no funds
be provided ' for the conference
because it is uncertain how much,
if any, money remains in the
Student Government budget.

“Since our balance is
question,
requests should be considered until
we determine exactly what the
situation is,” Cooper said. “We

.just don’t know how much money
we have.”

Cooper also said the rationale
used previously for denying alloca-
tions for SCAR activities still stood.
Those included that the "conference
is an off-campus event, SCAR is
not a recognized Pitt student
organization, and the Allocations
Committee has decided not to fund
conferences of any type.

The uncertainty over the amount
of funds in the budget is caused by

, an inability at this time to ascertain
how many students actually will
paytheir tuition bills this term and
winter term.
include activities fees, which make
up the budget, Student Govern-
ment Advisor Nancy Evans ex-
plained.

in

Board member Mark Satinoff

was the major critic Thursday night
of the Allocations recommendation.
“It seems to me every time the

committee has come back on this-

request, there are stronger scare
tactics and claims we are more and
more in debt,” he charged.

-“Sometimes budgets go into.

deficits, and I think this is a case
where we should go into such a
deficit,” Satinoff added.
Originally, SCAR representa-
tives requested $500 for the
conference._ That figure later was
reduced to $200. I .. 7 -

Further debate ensued, with

Taught Press Lessons A

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

A change in the attitude of the
American press and public is due in
part to lessons drawn from the
McCarthy‘ era, former State De-
partment official Alger Hiss said in
a speech’ here Wednesday.

“The whole country was carried
away with hysteria during the
McCarthy period, but the press and
public attitudes generally have
totally different attitudes now,”
Hiss said. “The press is much
more searching, investigating and
objective. Journalists are also
more independent. During the
McCarthy era, if a reporter was
independent, he was fired.”

Hiss pointed out that only 15% of
the population were college edu-
cated when the McCarthy investi-
gations were being conducted and
that figure has grown to nearly
50%. -

“You cannot have the openness

,and accessibility to historical

material that is available in a
university and remain no-noth-
ings." '
Approximately 300 people were
in the "Student Union Ballroom to
hear Hiss, who
temporary secretary of the United
Nations after its founding in 1945.
Hiss was convicted for perjury for
denying he passed State Depart-
ment documents to the Communist

“I also think students should be
‘given a key to unlock the door, now
bolted at night, between Towers B
and C. There’s no need to make
things inconvenient for students.”

SGB members voiced some
objections to the plan.

“I'm not sure what's meant by a
‘suspicious person,”’ Platt said.
“Would I become a suspicious
person ifl wore an unusual hat into
the Towers lobby?” '

»“I can’t imagine students
actually wearing badges around to
get into the Towers,” SGB member

Mary Schwarz said. “I really wish‘

this whole dorm-escort policy could
be done away with.” -

Hubbard surveyed other schools
before drawing up his proposal.
Duquesne and UCLA are among
the schools employing student
marshalls for dorm security.

In other action, the SGB
discussed allocating $500 for
partial funding of student bus
transportation to the National

Student Conference’ Against Ra~ “

cism in Boston this weekend.

The Allocations. Committee dis-
approved of funding from the
activities fund, according to Platt,
but members of the Student

Coalition Against Racism are ‘

asking the Allocations Committee
to reconsider the matter.

“Forty, Pittstudents want to go
to the conference in Boston,”
Board member Mark Satinoff said.
“the $500 would be less than half
the money needed for student

transportation.
‘ ‘I don't think $500 is an
ex'cessive amount of money, ’ ’

Satinoff added, “and I don’t see
why the Board is afraid. to get
involved in social issues.” '
Platt said he disapproved of
funding the bus transportation.
“Money from the‘ student
activities fee’ should be used only to
fund activities on campus,” he
said. “None of the Board members
would deny that racism is a
problem but it wouldn’t be proper
for. us to allocate money for
transporting more than one student
representative to the conference,
which is the custom.”
“Technicalities can be brought

up until doomsday against funding

bus rides," Socialist Workers Party
county commissioner candidate
Steffi Brooks said. “It would be
irresponsible of the Board to deny
us funds to fight racism, the most
crucial problem facing the nation
today.”

“We’ve been involved in social 1‘

issues before, when they directly
involved Pitt students,” Schwarz
said. “The conference in Boston
has nothing to do with students
here, although the implications
do.”

“We’re running low on funds,”
Platt added. “Until the Allocations
Committee is able to determine just
how much money we have left this
year, we’ll only be able to give
money to those activities that are
absolutely necessary.”

The SGB also unanimously ap-
proved the formation of a study
commission to evaluate the ef-

fectivenss of WPGI-I radio, the.
student broadcasting station. The -

commission will examine ways to

enrich service to students, includ-.

ing possible expansion to FM radio
and the use of a professional
consultant, according to a state-
ment from WPGH.

The SGB passed a motion
expressing ideological approval of
the United States National Com-
mittee’s plan to reopen the case of
Julius and Ethel Rosenburg, who
were executed as atomic spies in
1953.

“He was an opportunist who saw
which way the times were going
and followed,” he added.
‘(McCarthy was not an attractive
man. Dean Achison once said
‘McCarthy is a low, mean
scoundrel and to denigrate him is
to praise him.‘

“The power of McCarthyism was
so politically potent that even
honorable members of both parties
were influenced by him,” Hiss
said.

Hiss said he often is asked
whether he believes something like
McCarthyism will occur again.

“We don’t have a happy history.
The United States has had more
excrescencies of this kind than any
other country. There were the
Salem witch trials, the alien and
sedition laws, the No-Nothing party
after World War I." Hiss explained

“When you look at those periods of

~ history, you can see our openness

to other ideas can lead us astray.
The main common denominator in
all of those periods was an
unsophisticated knowledge of poli-
tics.”

Following his 40-minute speech,
Hiss responded to questions from
the audience. He was asked if he
thoughtthe economic situation in
the Fifties had anything to do with
the popularity of McCarthy.

“First of all, we weren't having a
depression then, but the end of the
war left great empires smashed--
Germany, Great Britian, Japan-and
confrontation of the cold war was
probably inevitable,” he said.

When asked to comment on the
work of the CIA, Hiss said,
“They're not even supposed to be
doing anything in this country.
And they haven’t done that great a
job internationally."

 Funding for SCAR

The decision by the Student Government Board (SGB) to fund the
Young Socialist Alliance (Y SA) with $30 for this weekend’s National

 - Student Conference Against Racism comes at a time when the

Those who would maintain that the Board denied the YSA’s original
request for $500 for 40 students because of racist attitudes or lack of
social conviction are ignoring some basic ﬁnancial tenets.

* Though the problem of racism is an ever-increasing one, and though

the National Student Coalition Against Racism "seeks to change

discriminatory attitudes, the student activities fund is designed to
support projects on campus.

A column and a half L

BY JOHN METCALF E

“The Taiwan Water Works has taken over the
responsibility of operating all the running water
plants in various localities and one of its duties will
be to improve the quality» of running water

throughout the province ‘sothat it will reach a’

standard fit for drinking.

“The company’s 10th administrative district plans —
to provide running water to Taitung before the end of ' p

1977 as the facilities in that area are good and they
can be readily improved. But in other regions
drinking water will not be ready until 1978.

“In the United States and Japan, running water
can be drunk from the tap. When tourists reach this
country and ﬁnd that tap water is not safe for
drinking, it represents a sign of backwardness. This
situation should be immediately improved so that the
water may be drunk without question."

--China Daily News

The China Post, an English-language daily
airmailed all over‘ the world from Taipei, saw ﬁt to
republish this article, which appeared in one of its
competitors. I agree with the judgment, of the
editors, though not, perhaps, for the same reasons.

I live in Pittsburgh, a city fortunate in the matter of
generic, if not drinking, water. There are three
principal rivers, two of which form the third, and

, three, or five, or eight minor rivers, depending on

how far from downtown you are willing to row. They

have enchanting names, like Monongehela,'

Allegheny, Kiskiminitas, Youghiogheny. The great-
est of all is Ohio, which flows to great and far places.
All of these rivers, with the possible exception of the
upper reaches of the Allegheny and Youghiogheny,
contain generic water. Nobody I know would be
willing to scuttle down the banks of any of our rivers

‘ and drink a -dipperful, or even a handful.

Adam's Ale is no longer ﬁt for consumption in its
original container.

Again we are fortunate. We have waterworks. One A

is run by the city. others are examples of private
enterprise. All of them are enormous,_ and all of them
do the same thing. They suck water from our rivers,
and process it. They ﬁlter, precipitate and modify it.
They demineralize, desediment. andenrich it. They
scrub it through charcoal,‘ disinfect it through
chlorine, and improve it through the additional of
stannous fluoride. -They pump it into reservoirs and
then pump it into the homes of the thousands of
people who work in our mines and factories and
laboratories.

These huge facilities serve the people, and eha_rgg_

My compliments on an interest-
ing and informative article on the
Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and

ballot is ﬁne. It is the right of the
YSA to make such charges, but it is
also the responsibility of the Pitt

the people for their service. Most of the expensive
work of the waterworks is the removal of strange
chemicals that have been added to our rivers by our
local mines and factories and laboratories.
Something is wrong here. Recently one of our local
waterworks’ encountered a problem it had not

with turned up in the river, passed through all its
processing, and emerged from the taps of its
customers. Many of them were annoyed. The smell
of the water was staggering; it made clothes washed
in it radiate a foulness likely to embarrass the
wearer. It tasted worse than it smelled. Still, many
people, convinced that tap water was safe for human
use. drank the stuff or cooked with it. Most of them
gagged. many grew ill, and almost 200 of them
wound up in hospitals, though only a few were
admitted.

A debate on priorities followed. The water
companies were scored for pumping an inferior
product.

The debate went so far as to include a steelmaking
firm that had a discharge point just upstream from
the intake of a waterworks. The firm was outraged.
Attempts to reduct its discharge of arsenic from 500
pounds per day.to not more than 10 pounds per day
would be financially ruinous, it said.

Further, there was no reason to believe the arsenic
detected downstream was their arsenic; yet further,
there was no reason to believe, even if it was their
arsenic, that it was harmful to those who ingested it;
further again, even if arsenic was harmful, it was the
job of the waterworks to make the water safe to drink.

In addition, if the ﬁrm could not discharge arsenic,
it would go out of business, or more to a less ﬁnicky
neighborhood. Thousands would be thrown out of

’ work. and would be unable to pay their water bills.

This reasoning goes on, but it is both predictable
aml dull. 4 »

There have been recent reports, based on
cheerfully informal sort of observation, that tap water
provides only about one per cent of the fluid intake of

young Americans. The 99'—per cent slack is taken up *3 3

by juices, soft drinks, beer and other commercially
available drinks. We must, in charity, assume none
of the, substitutes are made with tap water.

Let us get out of the sludge of our rivers, and
return to our colleagues in Taipei. They would be

. well advised to give up their mad dream‘ of potable

tap water.

By the time the equipment is installed it will be too
late. I cannot speak for the rivers of Japan, but, by
1978, tourists are likely to consider the consumption
of tap water evidence, not only of backwardness, but
of lunacy. _

Sexism a la Pitt F

This Male World of Ours

BY BILL KALMAN

In a democracy, one would think
women, who comprise a majority of
the population, would have a lot to
say about the policies of their
society. Let's take a look at the
position of women in the_ United
States. and, more speciﬁcally, at

‘the University of Pittsburgh to see

if that's the case.

In‘ the United States, women
didn't win the right to vote until as
recently as the 1920s. Until very
recently, women had no access to
birth control or abortions, techni-
ques originally developed by
women hundreds of years ago,
before medicine became a male
province. Today, women are
discriminated against in hiring and
promotion on a systematic basis
and are often paid as little as half of
what their male‘ counterparts
receive for the same work._ Women
are socialized at an early age to
deny their own desires and‘
ambitions in favor of playing a
supportive, secondary role towards
men. _

It is for reasons like these that
the current. feminist movement has
classiﬁed our society as sexist.
And what about Pitt? A. quick
survey of articles appearing this
term in the Pitt News demonstrates

p.) that sexism is certainly alive and

and more blatant forms.

For example. a recent article by,
news editor Gene Grabowski
entitled “Freshpeople: A Crop of
Pre-Professionals" had the follow-
ing to say about ﬁrst-year student
Cindy Gangone: “She's a natural
sorority girl if ever there was one.
She's the best dresser of the group,
and her teeth are all straight. And
she knows how to act shy without
being so.” While Grabowski
seems to feel Gangone’s . most
salient features were her teeth and
her ‘.l0th€‘S, he didn't see ﬁt to even
comment on the physical attributes
of the males in his article.

In the September 8 News, a
photo A of a woman catching a
Frisbee was captioned
“SNATCH.” While the pun was
probably intended to sail over the
heads of most students as an

innocuous reference to catching a
Frisbee, it did not go over the head
of Karen Marsden. A When
Marsden protested the sexist
caption, her letter to the News
elicited a personal attacl» by one
Charles W. Sohn.

In his letter to the‘ News,
Sohn(who is, no doubt, an unsung

"Sigmund Freud) deduced the

following about Karen Marsden:

Marsden is a “sadly disturbed and
embittered young lady” who, Sohn
implies, would rather be a man
than a woman and who probably
had deep-grained pathological con-
flicts about her father. While

accusing Marsden of the use of ~

“tecnybopperish vulgarity," Sohn
had nothing to say about the real
sexist vulgarity in the “SNATCH”
caption. Women are tired of being
reduced to walking, talking sex
organs and then being subjected to
quack psychoanalysis, when they
object to such treatment.

Dan Miulholland’s column on
abortion in the September 24 News
is a good expression of one of the
more damaging attitudes about
women on this campus. Mulhol-
land claims abortion is murder and
should be recriminalized with staff
penalties. He refers to the

abortions women have received

since the Supreme Court decision
in l973 that legalized abortion as
“mass murder that would make
Hitler and King Herod look like
choir boys." V _
Mulholland’s‘ column does not
appear in a vacuum. Since 1973, a
slew of bills seeking to overturn the
1973 Supreme Court ruling have
been introduced into state and
federal legislatures. Anti-abortion
organizations are on a campaign to
reverse the Supreme Court "deci-
sion. .
The argument anti-abortion
groups raise most often and that
Mulholland uses in his column is
that an unborn fetus is the same as
a child. and deserves the same
rights. In fact, a fetus has no
independent experience in the
world, and, so far as scientists can
ascertain, no thoughts or emotions.
Of course, a fetus, like an ovum or
sperm, has the capacity for further

life under certain conditions. But
the question of whether that living
tissue constitues a human being is
essentially moral and religious in
nature. Many religions do not
recognize the existence of a human
being until after birth. Mulholland
is proposing that government
legislate moral beliefs for women
on the . basis of one religious
tradition.

Nobody is in a position to decide
whether or not a woman should go
through the process of carrying,
bearing and raising achild except
the woman herself -- not the
church, not the state and certainly
not Mulholland, whose life is
virtually untouchedby any of the
problems posed by pregnancy,
childbirth and childrearing in this
society.

The true significance of the
abortion issue lies in~the struggle
by women forautonomy in a society
that attempts to track them into a
dependent, subservient status as
wives and mothers. Those who
speak in the mythical interests of
fetuses 'are- often the same
right-wing ideologists who oppose
government funding for child care
for living children and equal
education for real live children in
Boston and other cities.

Hitler, who Mulholland would
have us see as a protagonist of
abortion rights, actually illegalized
abortions in the belief that
women's domain was ‘kinder,

kuchc, kirche” (children, kitchen -

and church). It is therefore no
accident that, as Mulholland points
out, the same people who “cried
long and hard for civil rights in the
l960’s" now call for women's
rights to abortion. '

The sexist views reflected by
these writers. are only one step
removed‘ from the actual policies
that cause tangible damage to
women at Pitt and in our society as
a whole. The case of Dr. Sharon
Johnson is but one example of the
kind of experiences women are
constantly subjected to. Johnson
was appointed assistant professor
of biochemistry at Pitt in August,
l9()7. Although she had excellent
credentials, she was paid only 2/3

  
of what her male J I '

colleagues
received. She also was denied
access to secretarial help available
to the’ men in the department.
From i967 to 1972, Johnson more
than met the requirements given
her in writing for the achievement
of tenure.

Nevertheless, a newly appointed
chairman for the department
informed Johnson in. January, 1972
that she was not being recom-
mended for tenure because she
didn’t “fit into the over-all scheme
of the department”--an’ over-all
scheme never before communi-
cated to her.

The only two other women inthe
department of biochemistry were
terminated without even being
notiﬁed in advance. At the same
time, no men were denied tenure or
terminated. And the new chairman
of the department started inter-
viewing men for assistant profes-
sorships with research back-
grounds similar to Johnson's.

Despite 400 applications to other
institutions, Johnson was unable to '
ﬁnd a job elsewhere and was forced

to ﬁle suit against the University of

Pittsburgh for discriminatory de-
nial of tenure. Thus far she has
had to raise $60,000 in the ﬁght to
retain her job and the University
has spent untold thousands to
uphold the discriminatory actions
of the biochemistry department.

Letter A

A.Better

If abortion of .a fetus is murder,
then why not a similar charge for
masturbation? Just as the fetus
contains the potential of becoming
a human being, the sperm released
in ‘masturbation contain the poten-
tial of creating a fetus.

Why draw the line at the level of
the fetus, I say let’s nip this
problem in the bud!

In a more serious vein, I feel

abortion is a fact of life, and not a '

moral issue. If a woman for one
reason or another needs an
abortion there should be no one
involved in that decision other than
herself. ' _

What the anti-abortionists

Undercover Reporlbr

_ Take a trip to any campus in

America, and you’ll see the same
thing.VS‘tacks of college newspapers
gsit, unwanted, in obscure corners
.of classrooms and parking garages.
V « You can see the most recent
pissuie of the collegiate press lining a
student’s bird cage, or serving to
slop up puddles of digested beer
‘ _' after wild parties.
College newspapers are taken for
, granted by all of us, and sometimes
we don’t realize how many
sleepless nights and funless days
that people, especially editors,
spend, to produce those publica-
tions we religiously read as we sit
on the commode.

That’s why the Cartoonist and I
decided to kidnap the Editor of a
' local college newspaper. He
deserved a night of relaxation."

- Besides, we ﬁgured it would be
 interesting to learn exactly what a
"I - newspaper editor would do if he
couldn't get back to his ofﬁce on a
“deadline” night.

We feared taking him away from
 his paper would be like taking a

steak away from a Doberman
, pinscher. We were ready for
 ' anything. _

THE SETUP

C Our third-ﬂoor living room on
Atwood street was chosen as the
site for the kidnapping. It easily
could be padlocked from the
.. outside, and the only possible exit
«Twas a three-story leap onto the
pavement below. V ‘
’We decided even if the Editor
did survive the jump, he’d be
immediately scooped up by one of
our “unusual” neighbors. I’d have
never thought of living so close to

Cigarettes, wine, piped-in mu-

Instant relaxation. There even
would be a glass jar in the closet,
just in case he pleaded a case of
leaky kidneys.

Our only problemgwas ﬁguring
out how to keep the Editor from
calling the paper and running the
whole deal from his prison. The
solution--we would remove the
ampliﬁer from the telephone. In
other words, he could make all the
calls he wanted, but nobody would
hear a word he said.

Devious, weren’t we?

The Cartoonist and I ﬁgured that
after he found the phone defective,
the Editor would attempt to smash
down the door, consider diving out
a window and ﬁnally attempt to kill
us. (We would be locked in the
room with him.)

THE ABDUCTION

As we sat and ate a typically
boring dinner of muscle-laced roast
beef and-freeze-dried stuffing in
the cafeteria, our table reeked of an

unusual silence.

“Why don’t you come over and

see a drawing I’m working on,” the
Cartoonist said, trying to gulp
down the words with .a forkful of

peas and carrots. We stared into

our plates with guilt.

“No, I really don’t have time,”
the Editor insisted. But that just
wasn't going to stop us. We
begged and badgered until he
reluctantly gave in. He would come
over for 10 minutes...so he
thought.

We quickly walked back to our
house and strolled nervously up the
stairs. Our Henchman sat quietly at
his post, locks in hand, ready to do
the dirty work.

Once we had entered the living
room, I leaned back against the
door, with obviously fake casual-
ness. It swung closed. Click, click,
snapl It was all over. We had him.

It was too much to take. I was

of sickness. The Cartoonist and I
scampered around the room like

do or say. We handed the Editor a
prepared note explaining what had
happened to him.

couch, a cheese platter from the
closet and neatly hidden arrays of
magazines and comic books.

The room was transformed
quickly into a haven for relaxation,
a den of lazy-man’s enjoyment. The
Editor’s eyes bugged out. He
didn’t seem to understand.

“This is really great of you guys.
l’ll come back after the deadline
and eat every last bit of this stuff
with you. Maybe we'll get a couple
more bottles of wine, too.”

He really didn’t understand. As
calmly as possible, .we explained
that we were all locked in together,
and there was no way out until the
door was unlatched at midnight.

“But you just can’t do this. I'm

the Editor. Ihave to go back.” His
voice was starting to get danger-
ously irritated. -
_ Iknew it. It was just a matter of
time before he’d have his hands
around our throats. We tried to talk
sense to him, tried to convince him
to sit back and enjoy his
incarceration.

It was no use. It turned out the
Editor’s girlfriend had just gotten a
new job, and he had a dozen roses
waiting at the ofﬁce to give her.

What were we going to do? Even
kidnappers have emotions. We
sent another trusty Henchman to
the ofﬁce to pick up the ﬂowers,
and gave him instructions to direct
the Editor’s girlfriend to our home
when she arrived. She would have
to be imprisoned, too.

Congratulating ourselves for
dealing with the situation so
skillfully, the Cartoonist and I
wrung our hands in glee. There
was nothing the Editor could do to
ruin our plans now.

Rring! The phone--it was obvi-'

ously was a call for the Editor. Boy

would it be funny when he realized

the ampliﬁer was missing.
—

L

“Hello." No reply. “Hello!” the
Editor screamed, and then handed
the phone to me. “It’s for you.“

What the...it was our bumbling
Henchman calling. Embarrassed, I
crawled over to the closet and
produced the ampliﬁer from its
hiding place in a roll of toilet paper.
and screwed it back into the phone.

“Yes, hello.” The Henchman
informed me the Editor’s girlfriend
hadn’t arrived yet. What was he to
do? he asked.

I barked out a few quick
commands to the dolt, and the
Editor asked if he could say a few
words. Why not? '

Before we knew what -had
happened, he was talking to one of
his assistants at the ofﬁce, and had

,given him directions on running the

paper. We'd have to keep a closer
eye on the crafty fellow.

Our Henchman soon arrived with
the ﬂowers, and the Editor’s
girlfriend followed close behind.
We locked our prisoner in the
closet, along with his roses, and
escorted the girl into our living
room. The doors snapped shut
again.

A tender scene followed as the
Editor crawled out of the closet and
presented the partially wilted
ﬂowers to his girlfriend. The
Cartoonist and I blushed and

 undercover Reporter: Kidnapping Made Fun  

turned our backs on the couple.

It was complete. What more
could a person want? Food, drink, a
«beautiful girl--all the makings of a
perfect night. But still the Editor
squirmed restlessly in his seat.

We knew it all along. He’d never
be able to relax as long as he was in
charge of that stupid newspaper.
Responsibility can do that to
people. Now if we had been
kidnapped, we’d have just sat back
and.... -

Wait a minute. The Editor was

taking off his tie. He was drinking
wine and eating cheese and
crackers. Hmm. Obviously a weak
attempt to pretend he was enjoying
himself. It would never last.
V But the hours started passing,
and he began to talk less and less
about the paper. He seemed to be
more interested in the latest issue
of National Lampoon.

The Cartoonist and I began
getting restless. This was im-
possible. He was just sitting there,
not trying to rip off the door or tear
out our throats. It was ridiculously
impossible. _

Suddenly, a dark fear started
creeping over me. I had a lot of
homework to do. And here I was
sitting locked in my living room. I
wanted out.

I attempted to read Plato, while ‘

the Editor and his girlfriend got
started on a few smuggled
six-packs. They weren’t supposed
to be having this much" fun!

After half an eternity, it was
midnight. The Cartoonist and I
were almost scratching the paint
off the door trying to get out. At
‘record-breaking slow speed, our
dimwitted Henchman (by now
exhausted from playing records
and eating scraps of food passed
through the crack in the door)
removed the locks. We burst out of
our self-made jail.

The Editor walked ceremonious-
ly out the door, pretending to savor
his freedom, just to please us. But
he quickly slipped back into the
living room to be with his
girlfriend.

Stir crazy, the Cartoonist, the
Henchman and I rushed out of the
house and down to the corner bar.
The Editor? He was in no hurry to
leave the “prison.”

Sometimes, we don’t realize how
many sleepless nights and funless
days some people, including
editors, spend for us. B

But college newspaper editors
aren't the only people who need a
night of relaxation. We all could

‘use a good kidnapping.

LSAT's and What
ﬂAYou Need to Know

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

When I took the Law School
Admission Test (LSAT) last spring,
I was better prepared to enter a

1 quiz show. Friends had told me I

needed to know a little-bit about
everything, so, armed with a
pocketful of aspirin and facts on
Vincent Van Gogh, Norman Mailer
and the Sixteenth Amendment, I
went to take the test.

What I didn't know was that

“trivia” questions no longer were

//sgzkncluded on the LSAT, and I

.2’

'needn't have bothered reading
Instant Expert Guides on culture
and science.

What the test really measures is

. reasoning ability and deduction,

according to Rita McElroy, the
director of admissions at Pitt's
School of Law.

“We used to include questions
on art, literature and other areas of
general knowledge, _but the results
were not necessarily indicative of
success in law school," McElroy
said.

“As the test stands now, high
scores are well-correlated with law
school success. Reasoning ability
comes through on the exam, and

.¢,l,g,:h.£1t's what is needed to become a
"S ’“ lawyer."

When I took the LSAT the ﬁrst
section was Reading Comprehen-
sion. Okay, that was expected.
Every initial-named test, including
GRES MCATS, and SATs, have
reading comprehension. But, the
next section came as a shock.

Nonverbal Reasoning. It wasn’t
my favorite section of the LSAT. A
series of three dumb little shapes
was followed by five equally
ridiculous ﬁgures from which one
had to choose for the answer. The
instructions say to choose the
ﬁgure that is related to “shape
hree" of the ﬁrst set the way

,, "shape two" is to “shape one” of

the ﬁrst set. And, if you can
understand THAT at ﬁrst glance,
you're a better person than I.

“I spent 75 bucks for a study
session for this test, and not one of
these god-damned shapes is like

l.':s.,

the ones we practiced with,"
muttered the man on my right. '

“Seventy-ﬁve dollars shot to
hell, and I’ll probably flunk.”

I hadn't enrolled for the study’
sessi_ons since I wasn't sure I
wanted to be a lawyer, chicken
farmer or something in between.
But, of those who paid the fee and
took the sessions, most were
unhappy with the results.

“The sessions helped me know
what to expect on the LSAT, but I
can’t really say it helped me raise
my score," said Mitch Volpe.

“The only thing they can really
teach you is to understand the
instructions. As far as reasoning
-goes, you’ve either got it or you
don't. No amount of studying is
going to help,” Volpe said.

The Law Interpretation sections,
for example, require no previous
knowledge of the law. A deﬁnition
of arson will be given before you
read the cases involving burning of
property and then decide which
constitutes arson.

The trouble is, the samples read
like Supreme Court decisions.
“Party of the ﬁrst part," “there-
fore" and “whereas” appear in
every second sentence.

The English Expression Test also
deﬁnes terms before questions
appear. Verbosity, Faulty Gram-
mar and Diction errors mayor may
not appear in the following
sentences; the student must
decide. No amount of preparation
seemed to help. After all, I’d been
a writing major for three years, and
the English Expression test was my
lowest score.

The Rewriting of Written Pas-
sages‘ test was my favorite, since
there.‘ are no set lists of right
answers. If the instructions say to
make 10 corrections to better
organize the given paragraph, any
10 plausible corrections will be
given credit.  , A

  Starship '5 Creativity
   Takes A Nose Dive

BY DOUG GEBHARD
The recent popularity of the Jefferson Starship has had me bafﬂed
and l can’t quite ﬁgure out why it upsets me so. , Sure I like Starship.

The en_ergy is there, the musicianship(except that of Craig Chachiqou).

is certainly up to par, but there's something that just ain’t exactly
right. Take “Miracles" for instance.

This song is the prime reason for this sudden spark of success, and
ironically enough it was written by Marty Balin. If you don't know,
Balin was the leader and founder of the Airplane who left after
Volunteers was released. The initial idea for the “Starship” was

A instituted around this time. Not only was he leaving, but Jack Cassady
and "Jorma Kaukonen were pursuing their Hot Tuna gig. It seemed as
if the walls were indeed being torn down...on top of themselves.

if if V. . - In place of Marty came David Freiberg from Quicksilver. And Papa

John Creach also was added. Not long after that, Cassady and
Kaukonen split, leaving the “Airplane-Starship” guitarless...except
for Kanter’s ﬁll-in-12-string. Jerry Garcia ﬁlled in, but only when
bassist Pete Sears and Craig joined up could this band tour.

Balin was the Airplane. His forceful singing and hard-ass attitude
reflected the late Sixties. His vocals on “After Bathing at Baster’s”

¢&'>G¢*&>&>=&><0><-&'><0‘N-0°

 

 

All of the Airplane songs now are overlooked, are forgotten or were

never heardwin the first place. When it was going, people were
ignoring Starship as a radical group of freaks who played psychedelic
music and threw acid in Richard Nixon’s punch bowl. Well, the acid
has been placed in your pocketbook now.

How such an inane song as “Miracles” could make a group’s career
is beyond me. Everyone is buying this album. It’s number one in
Billboard, the leading trade magazine. And it, well quite
frankly...smells of pooh-pooh. There is little or no creative energy
surging out of this album. ‘

The main thing one could say about the Airplanewas that you could
remember the instrumentation...not with this group’s album. There is
only one thing left to do. Rock and roll assassination...shoot the stars
so bad taste isn't spread‘ throughout the land. End it now before it

._spreads further.

For those of you who know what I'm talking about, listen to the
album Volunteers and
radio.”

  ‘Do It’ for Comedy's Sake  

BY M. C. PILECKI

Althoughnot exactly a sequel,
Let’s Do It Again is an appropriate-
ly titled follow-up to last year’s
successful all-star comedy, Uptown
Saturday Night.

The new entry

reunites Bill

' somewhat less than legal means to

gain a worthy end.
The buddies and their wives
travel to New Orleans, where the

- middleweight championship of the

world is being challenged. The
Challenger? A highly unlikely

Bill Cosby [left] and Jimmie [Dy-no-mite] Walker as they team up
with the film’s director Sidney Poitier in Let’s Do It Again.

Cosby and director/ actor Sidney
Poitier as a comedy team that (even
while ignoring the publicity hype)
jells pretty solidly. Poitier,
needless to say, is the straight man
for Cosby to bounce off his

- zaniness.

The hype is pegging Poitier-Cos-
by as another Crosby-Hope, an
analogy that’s not all that far from_
the track (although it would be
unfair to the former to bepresumed
on the same tacky level as the
latter). Like the old “Road”
movies, Let’s Do It Again features
a pair of naifs pulling off crazy
get-rich-quick schemes at the
expense of some very nasty
baddies. So much for similarities.

The: basic plot is that Clyde
(Poitier) and Billy (Cosby) are
ofﬁcers of the Sons and Daughters
of Shaka in Atlanta, and have to
ﬁgure how to stretch the $18,000

building fund" into the needed

$50,000 for a new hall. Billy, the

It doesn't take Jimmy the Greek

Fortunately, Poitier and Cosby
are in practically every scene, and

I Will Meet Steel Curtain

*7"

BY YAIER LEHRER

Terry Bradshaw was seven for
seven when Chuck Noll had to yank
him out of last week's game at
Cleveland because of a cut on his
throwing hand. Bradshaw had
been making up for a very poor
showing against the Buffalo Bills
when he sustained the injury.

Bradshaw will be back again this

' week to lead the now 2-1 Pittsburgh
Steelers against the Denver Bron-

(;»/cos at Three Rivers Stadium on

Sunday, and although he looked
good last week, Bradshaw still
must prove he can perform ‘well
against one of the better teams, or
at least a team of higher caliber
than the lowly Browns and
Chargers.

The Steelers will face a slight
challenge when they ' meet the
Broncos this weekend. The Denver
pass rush, led by Lyle Alzado, isa

very strong one and could keep-

Bradshaw scampering out of the
‘pocket quite a bit. While the pass
rush and defensive line are very
strong, the defensiveisecondary is

\_.«-,3‘-~very weak.

l

.2 Bradshaw, or whoever plays

quarterback for the Steelers, could
have a ﬁeld day if he can keep the
ball past the greedy hands of
Denver linebackers Randy Gradi-
shar and Ray May.

Gradishar and May have been all
over the field for the Broncos this
season. Gradishar, a third-year
man from Ohio State was moved
back into the middle this season,
sending May to the outside, and
both players have benefited from
the switch.

Offensively, Denver does not
have what one might call a glaring

weakness. Its running backs, when
they are healthy, provide one of the
best one-two punches in the NFL.
Otis»Armstrong, the AFC’s leading
rusher last year, along with John
Keyworth, can ground out the
yardage against just about any-
body. .
Another Denver troublemaker is
the wily veteran quarterback
Charlie Johnson, generally known
to have more guts than knees. His
most important asset though, is not
his knees but his arm. ' '
Johnson, possessed of a keen
mind (not to mention a Phd) and an
accurate arm is quite adept at
spotting his surehanded receivers.
Riley Odoms, Haven Moses and
wide receiver-punter Bill Van

Heusen are among the best, and let P

us not forget‘ rookie upstart Frank

V Upchurch, who has been coming on

very strong for the Broncos in the
young season.

It will take a strong defensive
effort by the Steelers to stop the
explosive Denver attack. ' Arm-
strong will haveto be held from
going to the outside, while
Keyworth will be spending a good
part of the afternoon running right
at Mean Joe Green and Jack
Lambert. '

The secondary will have a time of
it, too. Upchurch and Moses both
are fleet-footed pass catchers while
Odoms is a bull.

This is the second team the
Steelers have faced which have a
balanced attack. The other one was
the Buffalo Bills, and the Steelers
lost that one. Then again, the
Broncos don’t have OJ Simpson.

The Steelers should win, but not
without a tooth-and-nail ﬁght from
a very competitive Denver team.

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

Last year the Temple Owls
played the Big Bird of'Philly by
stepping on the toes of every
football team they played EXCEPT
for two. Those two were the
University of Cincinnati and Pitt.

This year the Owls are the ones
getting stepped on; by Penn State,
West Virginia and Boston College
so far. Butthey have managed to
beat one team, and ironically it was
the University of Cincinnati.

‘Can the Panthers be on their
revenge "list? . ‘

‘‘There’stno question they'll be
emotionally ready for us,” said
Keith Schroeder, Pitt’s assistant
coach and scout. “A win over us
could make the season for them.”

Revenge or not, AND despite
their 1-3 record, the Owls are a
good team and certainly will come
out throwing against Pitt.

“I don't think.there is any doubt
Temple will throw the ball against
us," said Head Coach Johnny
Majors. “They like to throw the
football (averaging close to 160'
yards passing per game, ‘I8 more
than Duke) and they believe in
their passing game.”

The “Mad Bomber” for the Owls _ f

is sophomore Pat Carey, brother of
Mike Carey, a former All-East

thers - ig Tostomp Owls  

center at Pitt. In four games, the
younger Carey has completed 51
passes for a total 639 yards.
Tight end Jim Stempel is the big
man when'the Owls need crucial
yardage. In that way, he’s much
like the Panthers’ Jim Corbett.
Stempel has caught 14 passes for
237 yards while ﬂanker Pete Righi
has grabbed 10 for 122 yards.
On the ground the Temple team
ain't doin’ bad either. Halfback
Bob Harris is thespeed merchant
and is averaging ﬁve yards per
carry. Fullback Tom Duff is the
power runner in the backﬁeld,
averaging 3.5 yards per carry.
The offensive line, anchored by
6-2,220-pound junior Pat Staub, is
a good one. Carey has been sacked
only nine times this year, while he
has 89 passing attempts;
Defensively the Owls use a
50-defense much like Pitt’s. Their
big man on the line is middle guard
Joe Klecko, who leads the team in
tackles and generally takes on two
offensive linemen at the same time.

 

DEFENSE!

   

Safetyman Bob. Mizia calls the

The kicking game, considered-by
Majors as one third of a game,
certainly is not lacking for the

Owls. Don Betterlich is considered . "I

college scene and has not missed

attempts (six of 10 this year).

Majors said.

running. We probably had more

game this year, and that’s unusual ‘-

for the fourth game of the season.” V
“We need better execution "and

areas.’ ’

some more stomping.

Cats AfterPiece 0fRock  

BY JIM LEWIS

If you owned a good, high.
scoring, defensive-minded soccer,

team, what would you name it?

How about Slippery Rock?

Why, the name is perfect;
Slippery would stand "for the
speedy offense that slips, by the
opposition’s defensive _line; Rock
would denote the solid play of th
defense. ‘

Cute, right? ‘ -

Well, it may not be cute,‘ but
unfortunately for the Pitt Soccer
team i_t’s true. Slippery Rock is a
team that lives up to ‘its name, a
name the Pitt Panthers will try to
put to shame this Saturday at ‘the
Rockets’ ﬁeld.

. “Slippery- Rock is a very
well-conditioned team--as they
always are,” warned Pitt Coach
Leo Bemis. “We’ll have a battle on
our hands.” ,

Battle is an understatement; war
is more the word for it. ' The
Rockets will be setting off the
ﬁreworks against the Panthers for
countless reasons.

First, there ‘if; the fact Slippery
Rock just came off an impressive
6-0 shutout against Edinboro,
giving the_ Rockets a total of 43
goals for and 2 goals against in 7
games. ,

Then, of course, you can’t forget
the fact the Rockets won the State
Championship last year.

Add all that to the fact Pitt has to
face Slippery Rock on the Rockets’

home ﬁeld. In front of a
pre-football game crowd. During ‘
Homecoming. At“ 11 in the
morning.

Asyou cansee, the odds seem to

. be against the Panthers. ,

Or do they?
Pitthas a-couple of odds in their
‘favor.’ For example, the Panthers
were the only blemish on Slippery
Rock’s‘ perfect - record last year,
tying the; Rockets? * ‘.0-0 and .givin
.t_hem -a-P15-0-1? ﬁnal record.‘ ~ - : .‘

 Pitt’ JV" football"  1.‘ oh

  ver.sI.I.s,._..the Kent
;ea[créa~rtaahea.t.;-,.  - - .«,  

 

Plus, since 1953, Pitt has played
Slippery Rock about 23 times. Out
of those 23 meetings, the Panthers
won about 18 of those games.

Quite simply, whenit comes to a
game between Pitt and Slippery

I Rock, the Rockets sometimes play

more like the Rockettes.

But Bemis isn’t worried with
past triumphs. _ ,

“Slippery Rock has a high-
powered scoring outﬁt,” Bemis
reminded. “Our defense will have
to be toug '.”

- Without a doubt, the defense will
have to. be tough; it has the
unenvied task of trying to stop
Slippery Rock’s explosive duo of
Art Rex and Kama] Houari.

Rex is the Rockets’ high scorer,
scoring about 30 goals last year,
while Houari was a West-Penn
All-Star. Both led their team to the
NAIA playoffs and hope to do it
again this year.

Pitt has the defensive players to
do the job, including goalie Frank
Bucci, backs Kim Blasko, Craig
Connolly, Mark Gannon, Ernie
Gross and Andy Behrend. The
defense has given up only 7 goals
in the 6 games played so far this
season.

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The West Virginia Mountaineers
come stalking the Pitt Panthers at 4
this afternoonin Schenley Park.
West’ Virginia, comingoff a loss at
the feet of Pen'n7State, is ready to
run down the undefeated Panthers
in their home opener on a hilly 6
U3 mile course. 

West Virginia has been looking
forward to their second clash, since

' Pitt beat them’ at ‘the California

“The contributions of the fres

Philadelphia is flying through

NHL’s top player in'Bobby Clarke,
‘ in Bernie
Parent, the most knowledgeable

baddest of the badman in Dave

Schulz. For what more could they ‘

ask? .

the league’s top goalie and one of
the main reasons for Philadelphia’s
back-to-back championships. Par-

_ ent turned in an astounding 2.03

, equally impressive 12’ shutouts.‘
* His 44-14-9 record was tops among

The Philadelphia attack is led by
Clarke--the center, team captain,
penalty killer, inspirational leader
and possibly even the trainer. You
name it and he does it. The Hart
Trophy winner put together 27
goals and 89 points ‘for 116 points,
sixth in the league.

By using tenacious checking and
team defense to their advantage,
the Flyers make up their ranking
sixth among the teams in scoring.‘
Rick MacLeish (79) points, Reggie
Leach (78) and Bill Barber (70) are
the only other consistent scorers
besides Clarke. Ross Lonsberry,
Gary Dornhoefer, Terry Crisp and
Orest Kindrachuk are nonetheless
valuable contributors on offense.

The defense has no stars, but
gets the job done. The Watson

brothers, Jimmy and Joe, and,

Andre “Moose” Dupont lead the
backliners, with help from Ed Van
lmpe, Tom Bladon and Larry
Goodenough. ‘

- The New York Islanders were the A

big surprise of last year’s playoffs,

but whetheg; they have come into »

- port is inotgggt known. After tying E
‘the Rangejrs.

or second place in the-'
division, the Islanders proceeded to
knockoff their crosstown_ rival in
the preliminary round ‘ of the

ver0ver Patrick Division

once again coming back from three
down.

Like the Buffalo Sabres, the
Islanders proved mixing youth with
just the right amount of veterans
makes a quality hockey team. But
the question is--Can they keep it
up?
The Islanders are set in goal.
Glen “Chico the Man” Resch may
have won fame in their playoffs,
but Billy Smith is the better
goaltender. The competition for
the position between the two will
be interesting, but no matter_ how it
turns out, the winner will have to

consistently play well in order to ,

keep the job. .

Relying on coach Al Arbour '

tight defensive system", the Island-
ers ‘failed to produce any high
scorers nor much of an offensive
attack, ranking 12th
scoring. Denis Potvin led the team
with a mere 76 points, followed by
Billy Harris’ 62'. Bob Nystrom, J .P.
Parise, Ed * Westfall and Jude
Drouin each turned in 55 points to
round out the scoring punch.
Potvin, sometimesthought of as
Bobby Orr’s~ heir apparent, also led

the defense which was ranked‘ third '

behind Philadelphia and Los
Angeles.
Hart and Dave Fortier are all

. It was

in team ‘_

Bert Marshall; Gerry ‘

the Islanders could have imagined.
Westfall who scored the
winning goal versus Pittsburgh to
put the Islanders in the semifinals.
Second-year man Clark Gillies (47
points] and tough-guy Garry
Howatt have promising futures.

Like the Chicago Black Hawks,
the New York Rangers are gasping
for one last breath before going
under. The Rangers are getting
old, especially in the goaltending
area, and many of their high-priced
players are not meeting their
worth.

Veteran goalies Ed Giacomin and
Gilles Villemure, at ages 36 and 35
respectively, have their better days
behind them and will be ﬁghting
for a job. New York acquired

V young John Davidson, who the St.

Louis Blues gave up on, in hopesof
putting an end to their goaltending
woes.

Though the Rangers were first in
the division in goals scored, they
were dead last in goals allowed. If
Davidson and defensemen Brad

Park, Ron Greshner, Dale Rolfe ,
and Gilles Marotte can put it,

together," the Rangers ‘could take
second place from the Islanders.
New York has three very potent
scorers. Perennial star Rod Gilbert
(36-61-97), Jean Ratelle (36-55-91)
and Steve Vickers (41-48-89) lead" a

youth and two very

Sanderson if they are going to have
a winning season.

The Atlanta Flames have nothing
to lose and everything to gain. The
Flames ﬁnished last in the division,
but were only five points out of
second place. Like the Islanders,
they have a team built around
able goal-
tenders. . *

Phil Myre (2.851 and Dan
Bouchard (2.77] are two goalies
headed for great futures, but
unless the defensive corps of Barry

.Gibbs, Noel Price and Pat Quinn
comes around, the Flames will'

continue to heat thecellar instead
of the attic.

Atlanta has three prospective
superstars in Tom Lysiak (25-52-
77), rookie-of-the-year Eric Vail
(39-21-60) and goalie Bouchard.
Curt Bennett (64 points), Buster
Harvey and Gerry Meehan are also
solid performers. If Jacques
Richard overcomes the injury jinx,
he could help out.

So what does each team have to
do? The Islanders.have to prove
they’re not ﬁukes. The Rangers
have to ﬁght for their lives. And
the Flames have to get hot or else.
All the Flyers have to do is sit on
their perch high above and watch it
all happen. -

Ex-/Vloody Boys Twist

(Continued from Page 8)
record released last spring, and
Ray Thomas who put one out two
months ago, leaving only Mike
Pinder to show some individual
effort. So hurry up, Pinder, I'm
sick of reviewing you guys.

The title is an obvious slur on
Edge‘s membership in his former
band, and it just mystifies me to
see these guys who make millions
of dollars and occasionally some
good art, split, then cut up each
'\ her in their solo albums. I guess

" .t‘s just another of those trends the

Beatles started. V

Never animportant force in his
old group, Edge puts together an
album like any rank and file rock"
drummer would; he lets another
guy do practically all the writing,
he names the band after himself
because he's more famous than the
writer-guy, and he gets someone to
imitate his old band’s style of
album covers to attract at least
some old" fans by making them
think this is _“.Moody” music.

The group could refer to
themselves more appropriately ‘as «
The Graeme Edge Band Dominated
by Adrian Gurvitz. After all, he

paggings lead vocals, plays lead guitar, .

and writes six of nine songs.

The music is a cross between
early Badﬁnger and Electric Light
Orchestra, always showcasing
Gurvitz’s scratchy guitar and some
metallic orchestration.

“In Dreams” is the only truly
good song on the record. It sounds
like it came of ELO’s Eldorado. The
whole band seems to clash in a
noisy. if somewhat exciting, battle

,Knifeu in New Release

to see which instrument will
eventually assert itself.
Though the album cover gives
Edge no credit for singing lead, I
think he's doing his own songs.

His voice is so bad that it’s worlse"
t e ‘

than Gurvitz’s. Though
distinction may seem slight, it’.s
deﬁnitely noticeable.

As far as instrumentals go, “The
Tunnel” is pretty fair—a bit like
“Shaft’.’ and the stuff Love
Unlimited does. The only thing is it
sounds like an imitation.

“Somethin’ We'd Like to Say” is
about as close to real Moody Blues
as you’re gonna get on this record,
and that ain’t far. Edge pipes the
notes out, almost straight across
the scale, then the music gets too
high for him, and a backing chorus
drowns him out just in time. In the
‘background is Ray Thomas——one
g.uy you don’t shove in the back,
this guy's chords were made for up
front. But what do you expect from
a drummer who moonlights as
bandleader? V

i . OPERA POSTPONED

Due to the present strike of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
musicians. the Pittsburgh Opera
openingof The Tales of Hoffman

Opera President Gordon Flagg
said the company plans to

Flagg said if any other changes

end, though, with Nicholas espe-
cially hamming it up for all it's
worth.

Lockhart and Amos (in a
different role from his father image
of Good Times) are nasty enough as
the New Orleans hoods. There’s
not many laughs to be found here,
of course. but they do -manage to
chalk up some hazards for the
heroes as well as serve as the
inevitable butts of ‘zeir schemes.
And as a sid ght, former
heavyweight boxing champ George
Foreman has Cameo role as a
fellow factory worker of Cosby.

Let’s Do It Again is, for the most
part, a well-paced light comedy
that gives full reins to the talents of
its stars, without which it would not
succeed. But it does.

Last weekend, Paris participated
in the Eastern Collegiate Tennis
Tournament at New Paltz. She
beat three seeded players, ﬁnished
in the top eight, and qualiﬁed for
the competition at Utah next June.

“I’ve got leg cramps,” Paris

explained. ‘‘I got it in New York--I’

think it’s just strained. I played

‘ﬁve matches a day!”

Was it ‘a, big letdown, coming
back?‘ From returning the serves of
the country’s.best collegiate tennis
players to an easy match that she
could have won blindfolded with a
splintered racquet and her shoe-
laces knotted? - V

“lean try shots I’d never try in a
regular match,” Paris maintained.
“Here, I don’t have to worry about

it’)! 1

a 6-0, 6-0 score. ‘

Gordon termed “a good match with
long rallies.” M

doubles, teaming Mary Sue Rams.

Nichols with Karen Kusmira.
Second doubles, Ann Seebold and
Terry Lies, will remain constant-for
the rest of the season.
Ramsden and Conway eased
through their match, 6-3, 6-1.
“I thought we were careless in
the first set,” reﬂected _Conway,~

“but we picked it up -in the V‘
_second.” ‘ _
