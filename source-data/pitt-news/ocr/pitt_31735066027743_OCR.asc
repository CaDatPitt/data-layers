Trustee budget will include an increase in cost, say officials

 

Pitt’s tuition is set to go up for the 23rd
time in as many years.

Pitt administrators will meet tomorrow
afterrloontodecide ifthey willraisethis fall’s

‘A. tuition rates by approximately 4.5 percent

5 when they ﬁnalize the 1997-1998 University
iepemlng and capital budgets.

Tuition costs in 1996-1997 were $5,184
a year for in—state students and $11,270 for
out—of-state students. A 4.5 percent increase
would mean $259 or $564 more a year,

respectively.
The trustee budget committee will hold

a public meeting tomorrow afternoon in

2P56 Forbes Quad at 3:30 p.m. to make a
ﬁnal decision on the budget proposals. If
passed, the proposals will move on for fllll
board approval on the June 29.

In May, the Pennsylvania state legisla-
ture approved a $153.1 million subsidy to
Pitt, which was $4.6 million higher than the
year before.

The legislature usually sets a tuition
increase cap when it awards the state subsidy,
but did not do so this year or the year before,
according to Pitt spokesman Ken Service.

When Pitt administrators met with the
state legislature in February, Service said the
legislators “indicated the hope of a 4.5 per-

cent increase [in tuition]

Service was unable to comment on the
exact amount of the tuition increase that the
trustees will consider tomonow.

“Usually the" trustees wait until all the
other trustees see the budget before releasing
it to the public,” he said

Arthur Ramicone, Pitt’s interim vice
chancellor for ﬁnance, also declined to dis—
cuss the budget’s speciﬁcs until after the
comrrlittee’s meeting. ‘

However, Ramicone did say the overall
University budget will roughly be in the
range of $900 million. That ﬁgure translates
to almost $70 million more than Pitt’s last
ﬁscal year operating budget of $830 million.

Service said the total operating budget is
ﬁgured by combining the state subsidy
amounts with revenue from tuition, grants,
gifts, contracts and income from endow-
ments and sales in the area of food service
and housing.

The operating budget pays for Pitt’s gen-
eral operation costs, such as salaries, mainte-
nance and utilities.

Costs for general improvements, such as
construction and major renovations, are paid
for with the capital budget.

Service added he didn’t think the pro-
posals would face major controversy and
expects them to pass by the start of the next
ﬁscal year without any oonﬂicts.

Possible tax hike not likely
to affect Oakland commerce

 

9 N

   

A possible sales tax increase will not aﬂect commerce in
Oakland, according to students, merchants and Pitt ofﬁcials.

Students said they are not worried about the possible increase,
which is up for a vote this fall, and merchants said people will still

have to buy the things they want.

Saying most products in the area are relatively cheap or tax-
exempt, many students won’t change their buying habits — even on
more expensive items. Merchants said that is good news and are rlot

expecting sales to decrease.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge approved a bill last week
that will allow residents to vote on whether to raise the sales tax by
0.5 percent in Allegheny County and nine surrounding counties.

Revenue front the tax is expected to reach $114 million, if

passed in all 10 counties.

1 Supporters argue that the revenue will pay for projects like a new
baseball stadium and improved cultural districts.
Many Pitt students said they are in favor of the hike.
Steve Gradeck, a senior information science major, said he sup-
ports the tax increase because keeping sports teams satisﬁed is cru-

cial for the region.

‘‘I think it’s a good idea,” said Gradeck He said the sports and
cultural entertainment resources are what the region thrives on and

improving them is crucial.

“Pittsburgh would be on a downhill slide without both of its

teams,” Gradeck said.

He said he thought that the improvements paid for by the money .
would keep younger people in the region. The area now hosts one of

n’t expect students’ spending habits to

“I don’t think people like it, but I don’t

said. “Most students use a credit card anyway

Mike Chizmar, the owner of the

The other half funded the Regional

Opponents of the possible hike say
increasing taxes will hurt businesses and
individual buyers because goods will be even
cheaper in other counties.

From a business stand point, Chizmar
said he foresees very little impact on sales in
his store, since his main selling item — texts
—are tax—exempt and supplies usually cost
just a couple dollars.

“If they pass [the tax], there’s no way around
it.”

Workinger said she has other worries
about the bill. She is skeptical the tax would
be lifted after seven years, as set forth in the
state bill.

“Once they pass [a tax] it never comes
off. Never,” she said.

Even retailers of more expensive goods,
such as jewelry, expect little or no change in
their sales.

The owner of Touch of Gold jewelry

“If sales go down, it won’t be because of

Pitt's oommercid enterprises ‘"

On campus, where a majority of sales
are tax—exernpt because of Pitt’s academic
status, administrators said there shouldn't be
any ramiﬁcations in most of Pitt’s sales.

Pitt owns and operates the Book Center,
the Health Book Center and the Pitt Shop -—-
where all school texts are tax exempt for Pitt
students and employees. However, clothing
and supplies would be hit by the tax.

Pitt administrators said they foresee no
change in their $13 million in sales during the
July to June ﬁscal year ofUniversity retailers.

Oﬁcials in the Pitt Book Center, located
in Schenley Quad, expect very few changes
in their Spring sales, which would be the ﬁrst
major purchasing season effected by the tax
increase.

Rosemarie Slezack, director of the Book
Center, said she thinks sales on smaller “lux-
ury" items —— such as novels, art supplies and
oﬂice supplies -—- may be alfected by the tax
because of people’s larger purchases in the
region.

She said people who face several hun-
dred dollars in additional taxes when they
buy expensive items, such as a car, may buy
fewer small luxury items.

Sle7ack said there are probably many
retailers praying the tax will not pass.

She said students will still come in to
buy their books as usual, and the Book
Center isn’t likely to suffer any major losses
in sales.

Though restaurants will be hit by the tax,
campus food services are exempt from any
state sales tax because they cater to Pitt stu-
dents and employees, according to Food
Services Director Betsy Sallade—Farina.

Sallade—Farina said that only the two

But one feels safe saying the bitter
cold of Pittsburgh’s winters are gone —— at
least for a few months. Residents are also
pleased to escape the coldest May on
record, and they are hoping the low tem-

According to Rich Redmond of the

May average temperature of 54.2 degrees
ousted the old record of 54.3. Redmond
said unusual winds from the northwest
brought cold temperatures from the Great
Lakes and Canada.

“We have returned to more normal

Redmond said.

S s Get out and enjoy the
8 weather while it lasts!

Summer is finally here! It’s been a long winter, don’t
you think? Now is definitely the time for some well-
deserved rest and relaxation and, even more importantly,
for some recreation!

Get outside! It’s beautiful out there. Even if it might
rain, go and play in the rain. You won’t melt. And better
yet, you won’t even get frostbite.

If you’re not quite sure what to do, just go out and make
it up as you go along. Maybe you can grab some friends and
a frisbee and go toss it around on the Cathedral lawn. If the
lawn is full, throw it back and forth across Bigelow
Boulevard in between cars — they won’t bother you, and
you won’t actually be on the street, either, so it’s safe.

If you don’t have a frisbee, use that dinner plate you
stole from home; Mom won’t miss it, if she doesn’t already.

If you have a partner, take him or her for a hand-held
walk through Schenley Park. Maybe ﬁnd a good-sized bush
and have sex behind it. Just look out for the Poison Sumac
trees, but if you’re too late, remember that Calamine lotion
works best for itching. a

Make use of Schenley Park. It is an oasis of beauty just
outside this desert we call Pitt Campus. Go there for the
free movies on Sundays. Even if they’re showing The
Brady Bunch Movie, it’s better than sitting inside and play-
ing “Cooties” or “Don’t Spill the Beans.”

For some juvenile fun, look around for lost incoming
freshman asking for directions and send them on the
longest way possible to their destination. Or how about
putting up your own table in front of the Union and trying
to see how many freshman you can get to sign up for Jello
wrestling?

The sunny weather is also a good time just to lie out and
get a tan. What better way is there to differentiate ourselves
from the computer-monitor—glare-induced albino look of
CMU students?

It’s good and fun to get out of Oakland sometimes too.
Pittsburgh definitely has tourist attractions with the inclines
and Mt. Washington. Go and take a ride up one of the
inclines and look at the city from above. Don’t have money
to pay for the incline? Take a pair of roller skates along.

So go out and enjoy the nice weather. We’ve waited
long enough for it. And this is Pittsburgh, so who knows
how long it will last? I

Seize the moment; try to kiss her

 

It feels like an unparalleled act of stupidity
when you’re trying to explain yourself to the
person you have a crush on. “Gee, golly, gosh! I
really like you, touch me.” It wasn’t quite that
bad. Actually,. it was worse; it was a letter.
Yikes! Can’t take that one back or blame it on

beer, or can I?

There’s _a richness in opposite-
sex friendships. Elements of mutual
admiration, family-like affections
and slight physical contact are com-
mon. So you hug or kiss on the
cheek when departing, spit at pass-
ing cars and punch each other light-
ly on the shoulder. It’s fun and dif-
ferent than being out with the “guys”
or “girls.” There’s a sense of pillow-
like comfortableness that shrouds
these non-physical relationships.
Occasionally, one person may try to
take it to a higher level and may end
up feeling really dumb about it if it’s
unsuccessful.

Actually, it’s all in the tnanner in
which it’s done. I remember two
somewhat recent nights that reached
the “are you going to kiss me or not”
level and stayed there for some time.
She’s involved with someone, and
basically, I should’a, would’a,
could’a kissed her, but I didn’t. The
moment was lost, but instead of hav-
ing patience and waiting for it to
arise again (it may have taken
years), I decided to spill a bottle of
Drakkar Noir on a notebook and 
write my little heart out. At least with an un uc-
cessful kiss, the dumbness of the moment would
have passed with the moment and might have
been construed solely as a product of that
moment. I would have apologized and the
evening continued. My true feelings would have
been veiled, and I’d have indirectly gotten my
answer to the romantic question. Personally, I
think she would have kissed me back, but alas,
the moment is lost. Carpe diem!

Unfortunately, my letter of love does not
afford me the ambiguity and variety of interpre-
tations as is found in the kiss. It is this ambigui-

   

_ty that is the safety net between admired and

admirer. No one comes across as a fool in love
due to a failed attempt at tongue tasting.
Infatuations and moments of intimacy are bound
to surface in these relationships. Enjoy it, ride
the currents of subtle moments and see where
they lead. There’s an attraction simply by being
friends, but take caution when checking the
boundaries. If it does become physical, be pre-
pared because just as in any other rela-
tionship, the need to explain and/or
question arises.

The “what’s it all mean?” and “where do

endeavors, but they may arise heri.‘%”’

“dates.” A wonderful friendship wt-3,.
precious emotions has already been cul-
tivated, and now it’s simply a transcen-
dence of levels or the acceptance of the
present one. Various examples of this
can be found at the video store; rent
When Harry Met Sally or its antithesis
Pretty in Pink‘ (John Crier has a major
crush on Molly Ringwald). It’s natural;
it’s dangerous; it’s heart wrenching,
frustrating and part of life.
If you are playing the secret admirer, are
utterly infatuated with the coolness of
her being and you think it’s mutual, act
on it. If intimacy arises with your cud-
dle-buddy and the ﬂashing sign of
“should I or shouldn’t I” turns on, go for
it. Otherwise, you’ll end up sitting next
to me on “The Jerry Springer Show”
under the theme of “I Have A Crush On
My Friend.” However, if the moment
passes, wait for its return. Don’t force-
..  fully try to recreate it; it’ll come back on
its on. Above all, don’t write about how you feel
and send it to the object of your desire. Because
once you tell them, I swear it’s like a game: It
feels like the chase is over, and it’s not as fun. If
you can say with conviction, “I should’a,
would’a, could’a kissed her/him, but I didn’t,”
remember to follow it up with, “but I will if I get
the chance to do it again.”

Honest action can create the lovers of life,
and verbal honesty can be the breaker of hearts.
Should’a, would’a, could’a, damn.

Michael Ivan thinks that timing is everything.

You know what they say about the road

The worst part of it is, they’re right.
Only an ass would think that he could some-
how escape causing harm by blundering
through the world around him without
devoting any thought to how his words and
actions affect that world —— like I did last

time to grab some food, pick up the movie
and browse through the bookstore before
swinging back to Oakland.

Plenty of time, right? But I had to stand

MAC machine before hitting the video store.
And as these tiny little things started to build
into a big loss of time, I utterly failed to
notice them doing so.

Aw, jeez, I was gonna be late again!
WHAT was I doing putzing around when
there were people waiting for me? Now my
ﬁiends would be upset with me for being too
thoughﬂess to bother meeting them on time
—— and my only excuse would be a weak,
“Butlreally meanttobehereattwo.” (Good
intentions. Road to hell. Idiot.)

In an instant, my nervous system
slammed into overdrive, abandoning book-
store mode in favor of man-on-an-urgent-
mission mode, as I clutched my magazine
tightly and headed for the escalator. The peo-
ple around me ceased to be fellow human
beings; instead, I perceived them as objects
standing between myself and my objective:
the check-out counter. Turning myself over
to the high-speed autopilot honed during
years of pushing through crowded malls in
New Jersey, I effortlessly bobbed and
weaved my way between several other mov-
ing ﬁgures and stepped onto the down-esca-
later.

I wanted to dash right on down, but a
woman was standing directly in front of me.
Suddenly, I became aware that there was
also a man standing directly behind me,
exuding an offended air. It hit me that I was

Hockey at the
Igloo in June,
sort of

Nearly five years after the
city’s last Stanley Cup, the Hockey
Gods are once again smiling on
Pittsburgh. ,

Yes, the Magnificent One is
gone. Sure, the Pens got dumped in
the first round of the playoffs. And,

‘ of course, the defense still hits less

than the regular-season version of
Mark Johnson.

But the past few weeks allowed
local hockey fans to forget all that.
Now, there is some hope in the city.

And it is possible for Pittsburghers _

to be heard talking about hockey in
the month of June for the first time
in years.

This all started a week and a
half ago, when Detroit turned Eric
Lindros and the boys in orange into
the proverbial red-headed stepchil-
dren. The spanking handed out
every other night by the Red Wings
was the happiest ending possible
for Pittsburgh fans. Watching John
LeClair attempting the Heimlich
maneuver on Lindros after every
game allowed us to forget about the
quick disappearance of the Pens.

Last week’s hiring of Kevin
Constantine also gave hope to area
fans. For years, people have _been
telling Stan and Guy about the lack
of discipline on the team, and now
the Penguins front office has final-
ly done something I about it.
Constantine will quickly get rid of
the laissez-faire attitude popular-
ized by Eddie Johnston and Craig
Patrick.

And as if that was not enough
to draw Pittsburgh’s attention away

from the surprising Bucs or the ,

love/hate relationship with Rod
Woodson, the Hockey Gods decid-
ed to hold the NHL draft right here,
in our fair city. Of course, that had
been decided a few years ago, but

' that was all in the Hockey Gods’

big plan.

Now Pittsburgh will have a rea-
son to think about hockey in the
middle of June. This weekend, all
of the hockey world will be
focused on Pittsburgh. The draft
will give both local hockey and the
community a shot in the arm.

Nearly 3,000 people are expect-

Pitt All-Americans go overseas

Brian Knavish

 

Both of Pitt’s 1997 All—Ame1ican
wrestlers took their grappling skills far
beyond American borders last week Mat
stars Mark Bodo and John Wrthrow spent a
week in Macedonia, gaining invaluable
experience against intemational competi-
tion.

“It was deﬁnitely a great experience,”
Bodo said of the trip. “I leamed a lot.”

It’s a learning experience that isn’t

’ often afforded to University athletes, even

thoughthePanthersrankconsistentlyinthe
national top 25.

“Sending guys across the country .and
overseas is something that pretty much only
the elite, top 10 schools do,” Assistant
Coach Dan Payne said “And that’s the
level we want to get to. We’re doing all the

right things. It’s a matter of time until we’ll
be at that level.”

The trip came as an award of sorts for
the two Panther grapplers. Although the
wrestlers competed independently with no
University aﬂiliation, only place-winners at
last year’s NCAA championships (Bodo
placed sixth at 190, and Vtrrthrow placed
eighth at_ 167.) were eligible to go.

It is a tremendous opportunity offered
to any All-American wrestler, but unfortu-
nately many pass the opportunity up
becausetheathletesmustfundthetrip
themselves.

The Pittsburgh Wrestling Club, started
byPayne,isdedicatedtoraisingmoneyso
thatlocal wrestlersmaygainexperiencein
these oﬁ-season tournaments. It contributed
grwtlytobothPanthergrapple.rsbeingable
to fund this trip. '

The primary way this type of excursion
beneﬁts a grappler is by gaining him expo-

and competitive approaches.

Both wrestlers picked up some pretty
valuable experience in the “Macedonia
Peari” tornnament, and Bodo even captured
third place at the 97 kilogram weight class.

But according to Payne, "Ihetraining
alone made it worthwhile. It probably ben-
eﬁts them even more than the actual com-
petition. Training for a week with world-
class wrestlers will be a huge help to tho
guys-” ‘
Both wrestlers said they ‘feel that the

most prevalent style used in international

Martin graduates to U.S.A. Championships

Rachel Lenzi
 

She hid in the shadow of team-
mate Trecia Smith this season, but
Angie Martin didn’t hide quietly.

Martin completed her senior sea-_
son by making her third appearance in
the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships in Bloornington, Ind.,
as well as helping lead the Lady
Panthers toan outstanding team sea-
son, capped by a second place finish at
the ECAC Championships in Fairfax,
Va. Her individual performances,
however out—matched by her team-
mate, have been enough for personal
glory.

But Martin is quick to talk about
her team before she speaks of herself.

“Our team this year was strong,
stronger than we’ve been in a while,”
Martin said after returning from the
U.S.A. Championships. “We covered

   

-of athletes, but Head 

the points we wanted to cover, even
though injuries prevented us from
covering more of those points. But I
was excited, and I still ,
am. In a few years, this A
team will be so strong as
a whole, not just because 
of one or two people.” 5

True, Martin was sur- 
rounded by a stellar cast 

Coach Steve Lewis cited ,
her as one of the vital 2
cogs to the Lady Panther l
track team, pointing out
her leadership qualities.
“Angie was a leader ‘
by example, dedication L "
and perseverance,” Lewis said.

“We
reaped the beneﬁts of Angie Martin.
We couldn’t have had a fun or suc-
cessful year without her.”

Martin raced to a ﬁfth place ﬁnish
in the 400-meter hurdles at the ECAC

    

Championships in a time of 1:00.70
and was a member of the 4 X 400-
meter relay that placed sixth at the
ECACS, with teammates
, Joetta Purter, Chantee
 Earl and Shana Fadis. At
‘ her ' final NCAA
7 Championships, Martin
: placed 16th in the 800-
meter run, which coach
 Lewis considered to be
, one of the most compet-
, itive events in the cham-
. pionships.
“It was really tough,”
‘ Martin said of the com-
petition. “The field was
tough, talented and just
great, and I’m not disappointed at all
with my performance.”

While her performance might not
rank her with the National elite,
Martin’s effort made her an anchor for

the Lady Panthers, who finished fourth
in the Big East this outdoor season.

“We couldn’t have had team suc-
cess without Angie,” said Lewis.
“Everything involved her. Teams she
ran on qualiﬁed so she certainly was a
part of it. When it was the best athlete
versus the toughest competitors and if
you depended on a solid performance,
Angie did it.”

Three years ago, Martin qualified
for the NCAA Championships in the
400-meter intermediate hurdles and the
1600—meter relay. Two years ago, she
qualified for the Championships in the
400-meter hurdles. .

Martin was a member of the 1994
distance medley team that holds the
school record in the event (1l:5l.l3).
She holds the individual school record
for the indoor 800—meter run and holds
the second—fastest school time in the
400-meter intermediate hurdles (58.06

U econds.)

To top it off, the three-time All-

‘American ran away with the 1997

female Panther Award as the top senior
female athlete at Pitt, completing her
astonishing four years. “This season, I
went far beyond what I had ever antic-
ipated. But the best was my freshman
year, when we won the Big East
Outdoor title.”

Once again, the team gets the cred-
it.

Fresh off national competition at
last week’s U.S.A. Championships,
Martin described the competition and
was awed by the former Olympic ath-
letes in the field.

At least, at first.

“These were upscale athletes who
you knew would perform well,” Martin
said. “Then once I warmed up and
keyed down, it was .like any other
meet.”_

Martin will be training for next
year’s USA; Championships and is
looking forward to the competition,
using this year’s performance as moti-
vation. “I can’t be dissatisfied with my
performance. I could have gotten fur-
ther than what I got, but I’m already

 

mom PAGE 8

looking forward to next year.”

As a psychology major, Martin
explained that her field of study was
interesting because it involved discov-
ering new approaches for the treatment
of psychological problems. She will be
taking her degree to graduate school in
the fall, as she is considering Pitt’s
information science program, along
with Old Dominion University and the
University of Virginia.

Despite her impressive record in
‘the arena, coaching track is not an
option for her right now.

“I’d like to get the coaching expe-
rience sometime down the line, maybe
coaching after retirement,” Martin
said. “But for now it’s a question
mark.”

The Newport News, Va., native
attended Denbigh High School, close
to Menchville High School, where
Lewis coached track for 10 years. Her

» decision to attend Pitt wasn’t a tough

one .

“The University of Pittsburgh was— .

n’t too far from home for me,” she said.
“I liked the city when I ﬁrst came to
visit the school. My high school coach
knew Coach Lewis also, so that was a
factor.”

As for other high school track ath-
letes who are debating whether or not
Pitt will, in fact, be “it,” Martin offers
words of advice: “Pursue it, but
only if it’s something [you] want to do.
Athletics at the Division I level is a
commitment, a full—time job, not like
high school. You can’t choose to attend
practice whenever you want, and you
certainly can’t tell off a coach.

“It’s a lot more intense. People
who come to the program must under-
stand that they must be mentally and
physically strong enough to handle the
rigors.”

And as for next year’s team?

Martin’s hopes are only positive.
“I wish my team the best and I look
forward to what happens next year,”
Martin said. They’ll have a strong team
and we’ll be looking forward to the
competition.”

 

Column  
ed to visit the city this weekend,
and when they head back home,
they will leave behind $2.5 million
for the local economy.

And most ‘of them will be look-
ing at Joe Thornton, the 17-year-

$1

~ old Canadian who will probably go

to Boston as the first pick.
Thornton is considered to be the
best prospect since the aforemen-
tioned Lindros and will make his
debut here.

Penguin fans will also be keep-
ing an eye on Craig Patrick, as he

 

 

FROM PAGE 8  

and Constantine work their first
draft together. »

While the actual draft will not
have much effect on the current
team, it is a hotbed for trades. And
if Patrick does make a trade during
the draft, it must provide more for
the Penguins than the last few
have, or the optimism of Penguin
fans in June will not last until
November.

0 After moving into Florida, Arizona
and Texas in the pastfew years, the
National Hockey League announced its

plans for the next wave of expansion fran-

chises. V

The ﬁrst of the new teams, to be
located in Nashville, begins play in the
1998 NHL season. Nashville was chosen
over the three other accepted applicants
for early entry because a rnajor-1eague-
level arena already exists in the city.

Atlanta re—joins the league beginning
in 1999 (Their Flames moved to Calgary
nearly 20 years ago.), and the NHL is
scheduled to usher in the new millennia
with teams in Columbus, Ohio, and St.
Paul, Minn. '

Oklahoma City and Houston were
also up for consideration, but did not
receive a franchise bid. A vote by the

league’s board of governors is expected to

What do you call it when you’re)

walking down a completely dark corri-
dor, waving your arms around you to
feel where the walls are, hoping that
you won’t fall into a deep pit and that
you will eventually figure out where
you’re going‘?

Most people would call it a night-
mare. James Turrell, who built just
such a corridor in an attempt to pro-
voke people’s awareness of their own
sense of vision, calls it art.

Turrell’s work, entitled “Pleiades,”
is one of several such unorthodox art
installations to be found at the
Mattress Factory, an experimental
museum on the North Side.

Housed in an
industria1-look-
ing buildingthat
was, in fact, a
mattress factory
at the turn of the
century, the
M a t t r e s s
Factory’s perma-
nent and tempo-
rary exhibits
include works
diverse enough
to please all

types of art 

lovers: those who like art because it’s
pleasing to the eye, those who seek out
works that scream with social com-
mentary and those who are simply
looking for something different from

 

anything else they’ve seen recently.
Falling into the “eye candy” cate-
gory is Yayoi Kusama’s straightfor-
wardly‘ titled “Infinity Dots Mirrored
Room.” The museum-goer steps

through a door into a room with a

brightly polka-dotted ﬂoor and com-
pletely mirrored walls and ceiling. The
sense of vertigo one gets while stand-
ing in the middle of an endlessly
extending space full of clones of one-
self and bold red circles is akin to
watching Walt Disney’s Fantasia
through a kaleidoscope.

Looking for art that roars, “I
MEAN SOMETHING!”? Take the ele-
vator to the building’s fourth ﬂoor and
spend some time with Greer Lankton’s
“It’s all about Me Not You.” This rep-

Dan Marino
discovered at a
youngage that he
had a talent for

Boo no i s L

The future
Miami Dolphins
quarterback (and
Pitt alumnus) spent his early days run-
ning through the streets of South
Oakland, throwing footballs at stop
signs, trash cans and telephone poles.
On the rare occasions when he overshot
his targets, the balls found their way
through the windows of St. Regis, the
Catholic grade school he attended,‘

 

across the street from his house on_

Parkview Avenue.

~Marino describes this Norman
Rockwell—ish portrait of his Pittsburgh
childhood in “First and Goal,” a chil-
dren’s book intended to give young
readers the same encouragement and
inspiration in life he received from his
father. The bool'(’s basic theme — that
any obstacle can be overcome through

- hard work and the support of your loved

ones —— is a noble one, though it must
be pointed out that the Panthers’ golden
boy didn’t exactly labor under a host of
hardships himself.

Marino tells of his loving father,
Dan Sr., who taught his son how to
throw a football with a quick release.
The two Dans spent many hours togeth-
er throwing footballs and catching ﬂy

balls on a local field — which the city
has since renamed Dan Marino Field.
The elder Marino repeatedly
stressed to his academically under-
achieving son the importance of getting
good grades. The younger Marino
speaks proudly of his graduation from
Pitt: “I [had] a B average and a degree
in" communications. Not bad ...” It
seems odd, however, that such a dedi-
cated student would write about “the
Cathedral of Learning, which is the
library on the University of Pittsburgh
campus.” Maybe Marino just enjoyed
studying so much, he never even
noticed that the library and the
Cathedral were two separate buildings.
The phenomenon of the “come-
back” is an ongoing motif in “First and
Goal.” Marino discusses not only his
“classroom comeback” in grade school,
but his struggle to overcome the nasti-
ness of fellow Pitt students when the
formerly triumphant Panthers entered a
slump: “People trashed me on the local
call—in radio shows and_ in the newspa-
pers.” Once again, it was Marino’s
father who helped him surge back from
disappointment: “When people started
criticizing me, he’d write: ‘You have to
rise above it.”’ '
On occasion, Marino attempts to
elevate minor incidents in his life to the
status of near-tragedy in order to con-
tinue the comeback motif. He mentions
the time he dropped a ﬁsh tank in grade

and required stitches: “Mom i didn’t
think I should play in our football game
a few days later, but Dad cut a hole in a
piece of foam and taped it over my
wound for protection so I could play.”
Not exactly a career-threatening acci-
dent.

Still, the man has led the "Dolphins

wants a motif, let him have a motif.

“First and Goal” isn’t likely to be

pitcher on the
front of Michael
Shaara’s new
novel “For Love
of the Game.”
While the novel does deal with base-

game action; its real themes are love,
aging and facing up to life’s hard deci-
sions. '

Going into the ﬁnal game of the

Why go out and play sports? Just sit inside and readabout them!

— dominates the ﬁrst 100 pages, with
the baseball scenes being abruptly
introduced thereafter.

Once the actual game does start,
however, Shaara explains the intricacies
of baseball in exquisite detail. He gives
the reader an insight into theworkings
of Chapel’s mind amidst the excitement
of the game, showing that the baseball
player cannot simply clear his head of
all private issues when he steps between
the white lines.

The reader gets a good sense for the
ugly business of the game. Chapel has
played for the Atlanta Hawks for his 13
year career —— but when the Hawks are
in a slump, the team owner’s sons» take
control of the team and decide that he is
old, tired blood rather than a valuable
seasoned veteran.

Chapel, on the other hand, illus-
trates a spirit of friendship and loyalty

that is all too rare today. He spurns the 
need for a lawyer in negotiationf.

1
choosing instead to honor his verl:.;_

contracts and to rely on others to do the
same. Shaara paints Chapel’s strong
ethical stance in sharp contrast to his
bosses’ cynical business dealings.

The book is uneven in places. Its
fairy-tale ending is rather implausible,
and the choppy prose is rough at first.
But Shaara succeeds in communicating
the feel of the baseball world despite
these shortcomings. .

An older major league player such
as Ted Williams or Warren Spahn
would probably describe baseball much
as Shaara does. Chapel loves not only
the game, but his team as well; he has
no desire to jump ship and play for
someone else when the chips are down.
His loyalty and pride are traits to be
emulated, not only by baseball players,
but by us all.

Factory

resentation of a youngster’s bedroom
is an idyllic childhood scene twisted
several degrees out of sync with emo-
tional comfort. An obsessively exten-
sive collection of “Raggedy Ann”
dolls includes some with sunken,
sleepless—looking eyes, some of inde-
terminate gender and some with out-
landishly painted face makeup.
Portraitsof Jesus surround scribblings
about a child’s unhappiness with
his/her sexuality. A withered sculptural
self—portrait has a gaping hole in its
chest cavity, displaying miniature
fashion accessories resting casually on
its vital organs.

The Mattress Factory’s latest
installation, Winifred Lutz’s “Garden,”
is a pseudo-archaeological excavation
in the outside space behind the muse-
um parking lot. Lutz seeks to create a

 

garden that embodies both the natural
and the man—made environments by
arranginggrass, bushes and rocks
around and over the underground stone
ruins of the demolished building that
once stood on the site. The skeletal
structure combines with the simple
greenery and a bubbling aqueduct to
evoke the feel of an unearthed first-
century Roman villa, with both long-
dead and freshly alive elements some-
how giving rise to a calm peaceful-
ness.

One thing you won’t find in the
museum is a mattress exhibit. Then
again, the place is full of surprises: A
peek into an unused garage on the
premises revealed a room full of iden-
tical classical stone statues. Who
knows what else might be lying in wait
just around a comer? »
