MAYORAL ELECTION

is Peduto declares can

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

The ﬁrst of four expected Demo-

cratic candidates for mayor of .
Pittsburgh declared his candidacy I

over winter break.

Pittsburgh City Councilman
Bill Peduto officially announced
his plans to run for mayor of Pitts-
burgh-during his annual holiday
party and fundraiser on Dec. 13
at the -Crucible Steel Building,
a converted factory in the Strip

District.
“Tonight I am announcing .

my campaign for mayor,” Peduto
said, as the black velvet-curtain
behind him dropped in dramatic
fashion to unveil a poster with
yellow bridges and Pittsburgh’s
skyline that read, “Peduto, Demo-
crat for Mayor.”

Peduto, 48, of Point Breeze,
will likely face off against Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl (who assumed
office in 2006), Pittsburgh Con-
troller Michael Lamb and State
Auditor General jack Wagner in
the Democratic primary on May
21. Ravenstahl, Lamb and Wagner
have not officially declared their
candidacies but have voiced their
intentions to run.

In Pittsburgh, the Democratic
primary election has decided the
mayor in every election since
1933-

Peduto gave the hundreds of

Pittsburghers.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

New SGB members prepare forth

Mahita Gaj anan
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Gordon Louderback believes that
his ability to make a difference on
campus and see the impact of his
work is what will push him to do his
absolute best as the 2013 Student
Government Board president.
Louderback and the eight mem-
bers of SGB elected during the fall
semester will work to represent the
student body and allocate money
from the Student Activities Fund
for the spring and fall semesters
of 2013. In addition to working to-
gether as a whole, the Board mem-
bers will work on their individual

projects. Each member has three
different projects that are designed
to help the University run more ef-

.ﬁcient1y or improve student life on

campus.
Gordon Louderback
As president of SGB, Louder-
back will play many different roles
in his goal to represent the students
to the best of his ability. His respon-
sibilities include overseeing the rest
of the Board members and the dif-
ferent committees formed under
the Board, facilitating the Board
and making sure each member can
complete proposed projects and
working with the Student Activi-
ties Fee. '
Louderback, a senior, has been

“It’s all about building bridg-
es,” Peduto said. “We need to
break the shackles of the old rusty
political machine. It’s not about
politics, it’s about people.”

In an interview ‘on Friday, less
than a month after his announce-

'ment, Peduto also emphasized‘

the importance of revitalizing a

involved with SGB since his sopho-
more year. An environmental engi-

_ neering studefit, Louderback spent

his ﬁrst year on the Environmental
Committee. Enjoying the impact
SGB allowed him to make at the
University, Louderback ran for and
won a seat on the Board his junior
year. Then, feeling that he still had
a lotto give to student government,
Louderback ran for president.

' Although he is not necessarily
interested in a career in politics,
Louderback is interested in helping
students ﬁght against what they
think is wrong or work on what
they think can be. improved on
campus. _

“You shouldn’t have to stand
in line to get a permit,” he said.
“You should be able to get a per-
mit online.”

Pedut_o’s announcement ar-
rived after months of speculation

as to whether he would run. On

Among Louderback’s many re-

. sponsibilities are the three main

projects upon which he cam-
paigned to get elected president.

One of Louderback’s missions
is to make the allocations process
more transparent by telling the
public how much of the alloca-
tions fee is spent at every weekly
meeting. According to Louderback,
the Student Organization Resource
Center has all the ﬁgures, but with
a little effort, the information can
be made more accessible.

Part of the process involves giv-

ing the Board and the Allocations-

Committee the collected informa-
-tion every week. Louderback plans

Sept. 27,‘Peduto ﬁled the neces-

sary paperwork to run for mayor
and begin fundraising.

“The worst-kept secret in
politics is now released,” Pedu-
to joked after his announcement
speech. ‘ -

At least a dozen Pitt student
were on hand to hear,Peduto’s
announcement.

Junior Robert Beecher said ~

he attended the event because
of his strong support for Peduto’s
candidacy. A

“His views on regionalism

p and his views on the way to le-'

verage the assets of the greater
Pittsburgh community have im-
pressed me ever since I stepped
on campus,” he said.

Junior, Kevin Kerr believes
Peduto would prove to be a strong
mayor for college students. .

“He’s represented a lot of stu-
dents in his role as a councilman,
and he’s done a lot for them. He’s
one of the people who is think-A
ing progressively and about the
future,” Kerr said. _

In his current ‘position as

Pitt Chess Club fosters competitive sp

Pete Blais
Stqff Wrz'ter

It’s an eclectic group. You might notice them
while walking through the William Pitt Union
dining area in the basement on arandom week-
night. Some are younger, some are a bit older.
All are huddled in a few rows of tables, one
across from the other, staring down at crucial
decisions on chessboards.

Congregating every Tuesday and Thursday
night at 7 p.m., players of the University of
Pittsburgh Chess Club are in the Union simply
to do what they love to do: p1ay,.practice and
study the game of chess. ‘

The club started in 1962 when several stu-
dents would gather in a Pitt dormitory on a
regular basis to play chess. Since then, the club
has held its meetings in the Union’s Schenley

Cafe. Even when a 1980 remodeling phase in .

the Union disrupted the usual meeting spot,
the club carried on.

“For a couple years, we would meet at a
pizza shop about halfway between here and
CMU. We also had to meet in the Cathedral for
a couple terms,” Tom Martinak, head coach
and organizer of the club, said.

Martinak, a 1974 graduate with a degree in .

computer science, admitted he was just a chess
beginner when he started at Pitt, but has since

become synonymous with the club, dedicating -

himselfto the game and the University. A jovial
man in his mid—50s with white hair pulled back

to a short ponytail, you can ﬁnd him at every
chess club meeting walking around the tables
or sitting in to observe and offer an occasional
piece of advice. ,

Martinak estimates about 100 people are
involved with the club. Meetings are not man-
datory and players or curious onlookers are
welcome to come and go as they please. The
club has both its regulars and its occasional
visitors.

“Much of our purpose is to just keep people
active so they don’t totally lose [chess.] Because
it’s tough when you’re an undergrad. There’s a
lot going on. Butbeing down here twice aweek,

kids can still keep up with it,” Martinak said. '

The basement of the Union is the ideal lo-
cation for such meetings because of the high
traffic the area receives.

“We do it down here ’cause it’s a good way i

to get new people interested. People see it and
sit down and play a couple games, and they

might come back,” he said. “It was nice when j

the food was open until 11 [p.m.], then we really
got a lot of people.” ' A '
Besides students, the club also draws mem-
bers from all walks of life, regardless of age or
educational background. For instance, Victor
Semenov, a Russian immigrant, North Oakland
resident and chess enthusiast, stops by often

5

to play at the club s meetings.

“I met him at the library and he was playing C
chess against the computer. Itold himto stop _

Corbett plans to sue NCAA

O  ﬂ over Penn State sanctions

  

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett believes the sanctions‘ ‘unfairly targeted athletes,
coaches and business owners. Kenny Ong [Visual Editor ’

Pat McAteer
Assistcmt News Editor

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett an-
nounced Wednesday that he plans to file
an antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA in
response to the athletic organization’s
sanctions against Penn State University
in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child
sexual abuse scandal that rocked the cam-
pus in 2011. V

During the press conference on Penn
State’s campus in State College, Pa., Cor-
bett said the sanctions —°which include
a four-year post—season bowl ban, a $60
million fine and drastic football athletic
scholarship reductions — wrongly tar-
geted athletes, coaches and business
owners. *

“Just as we fight for the Victims every
day, we shouldfstand up and fight for
those who have been punished unfairly
by the NCAA,” Corbett said.

Pennsylvania’s General Counsel Jim
Schultz clarified the nature of the lawsuit,
saying that, as a trade association, the
NCAA violated its own bylaws by failirfg
to adhere to its own appeals process. He
added that the sanctions were levied by
a committee that included only NCAA
President Mark Emmert and the organi-

zation’s executive board.

More importantly, he said, Sandusky’s
offenses were a criminal matter and were
therefore outside of the NCAA’s jurisdic-
tion.

“The NCAA didn’t have any business

in imposing these sanctions ... This was
a criminal action,” Schultz said:

In light of Corbett’s announcement,
the NCAA has remained resolute in their
original stance on the sanctions it im-
posed on Penn State. Donald Remy, the
N CAA’s executive vice president and gen-
eral counsel, issued a statement on the
NCAA’s websitethat the lawsuit was an
insult to Sandusky’s victims.

“Not only does this forthcoming law-
suit appear to be without merit, it is an
affront to all of the victims in this trag-
edy — lives that were destroyed by the
criminal actions ofjerry Sandusky,” Remy
said. “While the innocence that was stolen
can never be restored, Penn State has ac-
cepted the consequences for its role and
the role of its employees and is moving
forward.” . *

When asked Why he waited six months
to ﬁle the lawsuit, Corbett said he needed
time to thoroughly research pertinent
legal precedent for the case. He also said
that he didn’t want to interfere with the
success of the Penn State football team,
which ﬁnished 8-4. ,

In addition to claiming that the NCAA
violated its own bylaws when it imposed
the sanctions on Penn State, Corbett’s
complaint also cited material losses with-
in the State College community as well
as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
as a whole. .

The complaint states a study found

SGB . *

the way it will beneﬁt the student body,”
Louderback said.

Louderback’s second project involves in- j

troducing a fundraising chair to help student
clubs and organizations in raising money.
According to Louderback, when student
organizations come to SGB for money, the
Board asks if the organizations fundraise so
they are not solely relying on SGB for funds.

“If they say no because they don’t have the
experience or the resources, Iwant to be able
to help them,” Louderback said. Currently, he
said, organizations are simply turned away
with no money and no suggested alternatives
if they don’t do their own fundraising. Loud-
erback said he plans to have the ﬁmdraising
chair assist such organizations in coming up
with fundraising ideas and provide materials
to raise money this year.

Louderback is halfway there on the proj-
ect, as the position for the fundraising chair
has already been created as part of the Fun-
draising and Advertisingjcommittee within
SGB. As of now the position is vacant because
the committee was set up before the Board
left for break. According to Louderback, the
ideal person should have experience in fun-
draising for University projects.

“This person can transfer their knowl-
edge,” Louderback said.

Finally, for his third project, Louderback
would like to create a system that allows any
student to submit a campus improvement

project so that those with ideas can come
forward freely.

“The eight board members shouldn’t be
the only ones with the ability to do a project,”
Louderback said. -

As a new president of a newly formed
Board, Louderback feels that the transition
will be somewhat difficult.

“The ﬁrst initial challenge is _to make sure
that everybody is settled in well and they
know what their role in SGB is,” Louderback
said. ‘

Amelia Brause

Standing as president protempore is
Board member Amelia Brause. Brause, a
junior, is responsible for stepping into and
taking over Louderback’s responsibilities in
the case that he cannot attend a meeting or
has to step down from his position. I

As a Board member, Brause considers
herself a representative for the entire student
body and responsible for allocating the Stu-
dent Activities Fee in an appropriate manner.
She has been involved in student government
since high school and got involved with SGB
during her freshman year.

While Brause said she wouldn’t necessar-

_ ily pursue politics after college, she would

like to use her experience in the organiza-
tional aspects of student government to serve
on the board of a nonproﬁt organization. L
Among the projects Brause is in charge
of is an effort to create an online portal for
student organizations. Unlike the Student
Organization Resource Center’s website,
which provides students with adirectory
of on-campus students groups, the website

would have information regarding what is
happening with a speciﬁc club on a certain
day. Organizations could advertise within the
portal to provide daily information.

“For example, if you were looking to get
volunteer hours, you could look up what proj-
ects are happening,” Brause said, explaining
that the website would make participation in
campus events easier. ' .

Brause would also like to expand the
Healthy U campaign at Pitt by bringing ac-
tivities like a half-marathon training program
and acupuncture to campus, To expand this
project, Brause plans to survey students and
determine what activities would further their
interest in personal health.

“I want to make it easy for students to
have more access to better-health lifestyles,”
Brause said.

Her ﬁnal project, called Panther Pride
Week, involves a campus-wide philanthro-
py event where student organizations raise

money for a charity of their choice for a week. _

Sarah Winston

Volunteering and helping the community
outside the University are also responsibil-
ities of SGB. Sarah Winston,‘ a new Board
member, hopes to make it easier forstudents
to volunteer. ’ . g .

“I just think it’s important to give back
to the community,” Winston, a junior, said.

-“For college students, it’s kind of difﬁcult,

but I think it’s good to get involved.”
During her sophomore year, Winston
was involved with the community outreach
committee within SGB and participated in
organizing events such as Pitt Make a Dif-

ference Day. Apart from her work with SGB,
Winston founded the campus organization
Challah for Hunger and works as an RA in
Lothrop Hall. ’

Winston said she recognizes that one of
the most important aspects to being a Board
member is the ability she and the other mem-
bers have to talk to administrators about
different issues affecting students.

. “I think it’s most important that the Board
listens to the students,” Winston said._“I’m
a little nervous: about it because it’s a lot of
power.”

One of Winston’s three projects is a text-
book swap where students can trade used
textbooks.

“Going through campaigning, I realized
this would be really hard,” Winston said.
“I’d really like if there was some sort of stu-
dent committee that could talk to the Book
Center.”

Winston’s goal in the textbook project is
to at-least increase the amount of commu-.
nication between the campus Book Center
and students so that students can receive
the best deals. .

Another project is a change in the ap-
pointment system of Student Health. Instead
of having students call the Student Health
office to set up appointments, Winston would
like to move the services to an online system.
Further, Winston aims to bring more options
to students in health services, like immuniza-

tions for students planning to study abroad. -

Winston’s third project is an effort to make

' by and he’s been coming ever since,” Martinak

said.

“Culturally, it’s interesting. We’ve had peo-
ple from all different countries and nationali-
ties. We’ve had a guyfrom Germany coming
occasionally. It’s really a good way to meet
people from other cultures and become friends

just through playing the game,” he added.

Based on his modest nature, one would
never assume Martinak’s status as one of Penn-
sylvania’s best chess players. His current rating
—— which equates to a chess player’s overall
skill level ——- is currently 2229, a number high
enough to make him a national master. This
number ﬂuctuates foraplayer, rising afterbeat—
ing a player with a higher ranking and falling
upon losing to a player with a lower ranking.
The only two titles higher than national master
are international master and grandmaster. But
Martinak is perfectly content with his current
standing and said his time is better spent teach-
ing the game to others rather than trying to
raise his own ranking.

“With chess, at each level, it keeps getting
exponentially harder to get to the next level.
And eventually you reach a point where you
have to spend so much time. to improve that
you just can’t do it,” Martinak said.

Love of the "game

One of Martinak’s current players —— and
a potential success story in the making — is
John Ahlborg. At age 19, Ahlborg, a sophomore
pre-pharmacy student, is already an expert,
just a step below national master. Heralding
from Ohio, Ahlborg became heavily involved in

chess in middle school and by high school was

placing in Ohio scholastic state tournaments,

even ﬁnishing a personal best of second place-

in one of them.

But for now, he sits across from another
player, hands rapidly ﬂying between the pieces
on the board and the timer on the side. He’s
playing what’s called speed chess, where the

, two players must make a move in tenseconds

or less. No matter the style of play, as long as
the game is chess, Ahlborg is interested. In
the midst of -the chaotic play, Ah1borg’s op-
ponent said, “I feel like there’s a weakness in
here somewhere, I just can’t ﬁnd it.”

Perhaps due to Ahlborg’s extreme dedica-

tion to the sport, it is difficult for opponents
to beat him.

“I try and come here for at least an hour
every Tuesday and Thursday. I’m probably the
best player here, and I feel like I should show

. up and be here. I also play online probably

about a half an hour every day,” Ahlborg said.
“I’m pretty obsessed with chess.”

But he, like Martinak, understands the
difficulty of improving as a player to attain a
higher rank, especially while being a student.

“My freshman year, I made expert. This
year, I haven’t gotten that much better. School’s
been tough to deal with,” Ahlborg said.

The young talent also uses the game to re-
lax. While some students may exercise, watch
television or nap, Ahlborg says chess is his best
remedy to relax during the week. 5

“I can always de-stress by playing chess. If
you’re playing for fun, like here at chess club,
it can de-stress. I can just turn off my brain
and play since I’ve played so much and it’s so
familiar. It helps me take a break from school,”
Ahlborg said. V .

While Ahlborg’s skill makes him one of the
best on the team, not every player is at such
an advanced rank. Amateur player and Pitt

junior Maria Bening has caught Martinak’s
eye with her vast improvement over the past
couple of years. A

“As afreshman, Iwas about a300. Now, I’m
at 1022,” Bening said, referring to the rating
system that assesses the strength of a player,
with less than 200 being novices and 2,400
and up being a senior master. “I didn’t play
seriously until senioryear of high school, but
I really began to like it and wanted to improve.”

“It’s nice to see people who come inwho are

just beginners and by the time they leave they

might be 1,100 or 1,200. That might not seem
like much for tournament play, but sometimes
the absolute level isn’t that important. It’s about
the learning process. For each person, it’s dif-
ferent,” Martinak said.

Bening admits her game is still a work in
progress, but it continues to improve.

“I really started improving last year as a
sophomore. I learned you can play a lot and

i still make the same mistakes. Chess is about

discipline and focus,” Bening said.

“I’ve had the opportunity to represent

the students of the University of Pittsburgh Y

for 18 years,” Peduto said, counting his ex-
perience as chief of staff for previous East
End city councilman Dan Cohen, and as a
member of City Council. “I’ve stood with

‘them shoulder to shoulder on a numbe -

of issues.” V ‘V

Peduto included preventing the tuition
tax. and stopping transportation cuts as is-
sues where he supported students’ needs.
He said in the case of the transportation
cuts, he took a leadership role at City Coun-
cil meetings aimed to prevent the cuts and
supported the use of a 1 percent RAD tax
to fund transportation.

Peduto saidhe has a history of collabo-
rating with students. In working to prevent
the tuition tax proposed by Mayor Raven-
stahl in 2009‘, Peduto said he met with
members of Pitt’s Student Government
Board. He said ultimately he and others
were able to work with City Controller
Michael Lamb to produce an alternative
budget that didn’t rely on a tuition tax.

CHESS

College basketball has March Madness.
College Football has the Bowl Championship
Series. And the Pittsburgh Chess League has
its armual, once-a-month tournament.

One Sunday a month at 2 p.m., the Union
assembly room morphs into a chess extrava-
ganza. Long rows of tables and chairs ﬁll the
room. Hundreds of players from all walks of
life sit across from one another.

They sit and stare at the boards in front of
them in the hushed and open room, only oc-
casionally getting up to stretch, walk around
or take a necessary bathroom break. The only

action is the careﬁil movement of selected ‘

pieces. Everyone wears a face of deep con-
centration and concern. While the interac-
tion between playérs is ‘minimal, the level of
focus each player possesses builds a climactic.

- atmosphere. »

The Pittsburgh Chess League, one of th
oldest chess leagues in the country (Martinak
said limited historical information has created

this notion) is now in its 53rd year. The League ,

is made up of an assortment of various chess
clubs —- 18 in total, including the Pitt Chess
Club — throughout the Pittsburgh area. Some
clubs ﬁeld several teams.

Pitt Chess Club has ﬁve teams (Pitt 1 through

’ Pitt V). Other local institutions including

Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon and Central Catho-
lic High School participate, as well. Some teams

have no speciﬁc affiliation and are simply just
a groupof interested chess players.
For instance, the “Weenies” are a group of

’ former Pitt- Greensburg students who decided ~

to stick together and continue playing chess

, with one another in the League. The “Gallant

Punxsutawney Phil—idors” represent the region
east of Pittsburgh. ‘

To play on any of the Pitt Chess iClub’s
teams, one does not have to bea current stu-
dent. Alumni, professors and even those who
might have only brieﬂy attended Pitt are wel-
come to sign up. i 7

The League tournaments contain four divi-
sions, separated by skill level. There are eight

the Green Fund Advisory Board ——'a supple-
ment of the Environmental Committee that
has to get voted in every year — a permanent
SGB ﬁxture. According to Winston, GFAB,
T when voted in, has a budget of $5,000, which
. goes toward students who bring potential
projects that can make the University greener.
“I want to make an office of sustainability,”
Winston said. “This will probably take a re-
ally long time.” V '
Thomas Jabro .
To ﬁirther help student organizations,
Board member Thomas Jabro has vowed to

increase allocations toward student service '

organizations in order to help fulﬁll their
goals as individual groups. , ' V
“We’ll have to make some changes. in the

- manual and bring changes that will be beneﬁ— ,

cial to empower those organizations,” Jabro
said. '

_ Jabro, a junior, served onthe Allocations I
Committee last yearand hopes to properly

serve the student body in his new position

onthe Board._ _ . ;

His second project involves overhau

on Sodexo meal plans tomake more ﬂexible "
. plans for students, lower meal plan require- »

ments and create more diverse options for

' food. To accomplish this,Jabro plans on work- ,

ing with the Food Committee. .

Finally, Jabro wants to work to get OMET

results available to students.

“I think it’d-be really useful if it was right _ ‘

on [the online Student Center’s “Self Service”
tab] and could be used for class registration,”
Jabro said. According to Jabro, the admin-

istration is open._to the idea, but the faculty

needs ‘some convincing.
. Michael N ites

Another major component of SGB is the "

Allocations Committee. Junior Michael Ni-
tes, a newly elected Boardmember got his

start on the Allocations Committee during A

his freshman year.

“I love how with the allocations process
you get to be a part of all the student organiza-
tions in a small way,” Nites said. “You get to
work with so many different people and meet
great student leaders on campus.”

One of Nites’s three projects deals closely
with allocations. He would like to move the
allocations process online using a database
called Symplicity. According to Nites, a group
could go online and ﬁll out a form requesting
funds from SGB, and the database would make
it easier to track the request.

“It can get confused with what gets ap—\

proved,” Nites said. “This would be a good
way for groups to go online and look imme-
diately.” . '

In another project, Nites wouldlike to see
an academic grace period where students can
have off classes the Thursday and Friday be.-
fore ﬁnals. The academic grace period project
was addressed last year, but there were some
issues, Nites said.

“The administration liked the idea, but the '

problem is ﬁtting the days in the calendar,”

Nites said. “That’s-where they sort of left it
off. That’s probably going to be the hardest
project to accomplish.”

Finally, Nites plans to work with Port ‘

Authority to see that buses and routes im-
portant to Pitt students, like the Airport
Flyer, will not get cut. According to Nites,
this involves having a presence at the city
government level and determining alternate
ways for students to get to their destinations.

David Rosenthal

Along with Nites, Board member David
Rosenthal would like to see transportation
options for Pitt students improved. Accord-

ing to Rosenthal, losing the Airport Flyer
will make it challenging for students to get

to the airport during holidays. As part of his .

project, Rosenthal hopes to prevent students
from losing access to critical city bus routes.

“Anyonewho has tried to ﬂy home knows
that it’s difficult to get to the airport,” Rosen-
thal said. .

Rosenthal, a junior, became interested
in SGB because of its lobbying efforts when
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett ﬁrst
announced budget cuts toward Pennsylvania
public colleges in 2011. He said he also ad-
mired how SGB’s allocations process allowed
for student organizations to function.“My
job is to.not only get the initiatives passed,
but«to make sure that student life at Pitt is
improved,” Rosenthal said.

Rosenthal’s other projects aim to help
students on a personal level. He would like to
see the University offer a one-credit culinary
class, in line with other art classes.

“It’d be great to have a class to learn how
to cook some good meals,” Rosenthal said.

His third project is aimed at students who
live off campus. Rosenthal wants to ﬁnd a way
to teach students about leases, traits they
should be wary of when renting an apartment
from a landlord..and ﬁnances involved with
off-campus housing. To do this, Rosenthal
plans to compile data by surveying students
about their concerns and contacting admin-
istration members. A

that the Penn State football program cre-
ates 2,300 direct and indirect jobs within
the state. It also says that the program
generates nearly $5 million in tax revenue
for the state and spends $16 million on
goods and services in Pennsylvania.
During his ‘press conference, Corbett
mentioned that the NCAA used the scandal
as an opportunity to promote the inter-
ests of other NCAA member schools at
the expense of Penn State, which he said
has the second-most profitable football
program in the country. ‘, .
Schultzlalso said that Corbett had not
coordinated a legal strategy with incom-
ing Attorney General Kathleen Kane, but
planned to do so in the near future. Kane
has been a vocal critic of Corbett’s han-
dling of the investigation into the scandal

during his tenure as Pennsylvania attor— '

ney general, saying that he didn’t place a
suitable amount of emphasis on the case.

Although he primarily dedicated the’
press conference to condemning the
NCAA’s actions, Corbett also acknowl-
edged Penn State’s moral culpability in
the proceedings, saying that if his lawsuit
is successful, the university’s board of
trustees should donate the $60 million
originally set aside to pay for ﬁnes im-

posed by the NCAA toward foundations

supporting victims of sexual assault.

“Penn State does have a moral respon-
sibility to the victims and to the commu-
nity, and it has accepted that responsibil-
ity and is working with the victims in the
civil'co'urts,” Corbett said. '

Sandusky served as Penn State’s defen-
sive coordinator for three decades before
he resigned in 1999, about a year after he
ﬁrst cameunder suspicion of misconduct
with a.boy in a locker room shower. He
was convicted injune of molesting 10 boys
and is currently serving a 30- to 60-year
prison sentence. _

Former Penn State President Graham
Spanier, retired Vice President Gary

ley, currently on leave from his post, face
charges that they conspired to hide San-
dusky’s crimes. I

“We’re excited for the mayoral primary,”
Pitt Democrats incoming Business Manager ' 
Zach Gozlan said. “It’s an inter—Democratic ‘ of

Allegheny County Executive Rich
Fitzgerald introduced Peduto at the event,
giving the councilmanuhis -first endorse-
ment. _ ‘

‘‘I‘m proud to be here tonight to endorse’
and proudly proclaim that I am supporting
Bill Peduto as the next mayor of the city 0
Pittsburgh,” he said. _ C

Fitzgerald said that over the course of
12 yearsworking with Peduto, he “came to
see Bill’s work effort, seriousness andlove
for the region.” . - —

Fitzgerald was the ﬁrst donor to Pedu-
to’s campaign in September, contributing
$8,000 —- the maximum allowable under
Pittsburgh’s campaign finance law — to
the campaign effort. 5' ‘

Peduto previously ran forma\yor in the
2005 and 2007 Democratic primaries. Bob
0’Connor defeated Peduto in 2005 and
Peduto dropped out of the 2007 election
early, after polls indicated that Ravenstahl
held a strong advantage.

Peduto emphasized the greater ﬁnancial
strength of his campaign this time around.

alone raised around $250,000, the total‘
amount his campaign earned in 2005.

“If you can’t ante up $1 million, you can’t V
be in the race,” Peduto said. _. -

Peduto also plans to put a heavy focus‘
on promoting his campaign through social _
media. He wants to have at least two vid-
eos a week on his YouTube channel and to
communicate with voters regularly through
Facebook and Twitter. P «

Peduto counted a larger volunteer and
support base as another difference between
this year’s campaign and his previous runs
at the mayoral ofﬁ_ce. v -

Peduto revealed in late November that
he will not seek reelection to his seat on
City Council, -a move he described as re:
moving the “net” from beneath his effort
to run for mayor.  ’

“There comes a time when you’ve done‘

teams per division and each team_will play
seven different opponents between Septem-
ber and March in a round-robin format. Each
team ﬁelds four players, who each play a game
against a player from the opposing team.
“That way, ' everybody ——-stronger and
weaker «.—- gets a chance to play, and it keeps
people interested in trying to improve. And
when there’s a team involved, it gives you more

incentive than just doing it for yourself,” Mar— .

tinak said.

Martinak, as chief organizer of the Pitts-
burgh Chess League, somewhat conveniently
schedules each Sunday tournament at the Wil-

 

liam Pitt Union.

Ahlborg joked, “We never have to worry
about traveling.” ' -

Martinak, an alternate on Pitt I, said he
won’t play unless aﬁll—in is needed. Ateam can
have up to 19 players, but usually has around
a-dozen or so, as certain players can only par-
ticipate on certain days.

Recently and historically, Pitt has met with
much success in the Pittsburgh Chess League.

“Overall, Pitt has the most League Cham-
pionships,” Martinak said. Based on archived
records, Pitt has been winner of the top divi-
sion 16 times — the ﬁrst victory occurring in

1968 and the most‘ recent in 2008. Also, Pitt,

has taken home the highest number of board
prizes — the winningest player from any of the

   

four divisions — a total of 88 times since 1982.
“The past two or three years, we’ve been

just below the top. CMU has some really strong

players,” Martinak said. i

For what it’s worth

While the League tournaments are the
culmination of practice and study for» many,

C the biweekly Pitt Chess Club meetings are the

bread and butter of the organization. While
many use the meetings to practice and play, the

time also serves for those who simply want to A
reminisce, reconnect and converse about the V

game they love.

That wasa huge upset,” Maruccio said.

Since moving’ on fronrPitt, Maruccio said
he still plays chess once in awhile at another
local club.

“This is actually the ﬁrst time I’ve been here
in a while,” Maruccio said. “Once you’re in a
chess league, you’re never really out. People
take breaks and might disappear for a while,
but you know they’re still around.”

But there was another reason for Maruccio’s
surprise visit. Maruccio played a chess match
just two days prior at atournament in Squirrel
Hill. With a small group assembled around
him, be recreated this game, turn by turn, com-
pletely from memory. He, like many others,
‘sought Martinak’s expertise. and advisement
on how to better play certain game situations.

. T For manyplayers,alarge-partoftheirtime ‘

at Pitt Chess Club is spent reviewing previous
‘games and seeing where they went right or
wrong on certain moves. During a live game,

players keep track of every move made by both’

themselves and their opponents. Maruccio,
with a few more years of experience, can rely
on memory. ‘ . r _ —
“Looking at your game, -that’s the way you
learn, by ﬁnding your mistakes,” Martinak
said. “On the Tuesday after-a tournament,‘ ev-
eryone will bring down their games and we’ll
analyze them. When you make a mistake and
someone explains to youwhat was wrongwith
your idea, that’s how you‘lea”rn.” _
Above all, the club facilitates a community.
Albhorg said he was the only one from his high

school to attend Pitt, but chess club has made i

it easy for him to create new friendships.
“For me, chess has always beena good thing
to get to know people by. It’s something-you
have in common, and if you can ﬁnd someone
who understands it, you know they’ve spent
time into it, too. I’ve been able to meet a lot
of people here. It’s been good,” Albhorg said.
Being the steadfast leader of the clublfor
so many years, Martinak said he’s happy to
provide an opportunity for students and chess

- enthusiasts to meet one ‘another and do what

they enjoy.

“A lot of good friendships have been made
here. It’s very nice to see that growth together,”
Martinak said. I . * V

THE STA-MATTACK

In defense of (some of) UPMC’ 

wage and labor practices i

Nick Stamatakis
Assistam,‘ Opinions Editor

At the end of last year, a minor
controversy erupted between‘
left-leaning groups within the
city and UPMC. '

A food pantry program, orig-
inally only institut_ed at UPMC
Mercy, was expanded to UPMC’s
Shadyside and Oakland hospi-
tals. The program allowed em-

ployees to bring food to support l

other employees facing difﬁcult
ﬁnancial circumstances.

The controversy concerned
the hospital giant’s supposed ig-
norance and arrogance. Critics
alleged that rather than address
the low wages responsible for
the difﬁcult circumstances, the
chain was cheaply turning the
other.way, giving poor people
canned peas and carrots in a
weak-willed ‘display of irrespon-
sibility.

The controversy ﬁt into a
larger narrative gaining popu-

larity in Pittsburgh: Tax—exempt.

UPMC, the region’s largest em-
,plo'yer, earns ‘huge proﬁts and
_ doesn’t do its fair share to give

back to the region or support
struggling families.

Of course, this ignores the
institution’s routine support of
many private foundations, in-
cluding the largest portion of
the Pittsburgh Promise, a pro-

. gram that offers scholarships to

the city’s public school students
to attend post—secondary edu-
cation. It also ignores that high
‘proﬁts ‘in health care are corre-
lated with high levels of care and
patient satisfaction, not graft
corruption and stinginess. - '
But this doesn’t matter much.
Demands for more taxes con-
tinue. Or if not for higher taxes,

then to at least raise wages.,Em- '

ployees shouldn’t need a food
bank to make it through the
holidays. .» . .

But as nice as it sounds for
everybody to just magically be
given more money, these de-
mands are‘ really nothing more
than misguided philanthropy,
at best. In the end, they would
achieve the opposite of many of
the goals activists desire.

_ For instance, nothing would
ensure the eventual demise of

UPMC’s competitors —— primar-
ily West Penn Allegheny —— than
higher wages. '

After all, high wages at UPMC
would by necessity be matched
with higher wages at other re-
gional hospitals. Much like the

effect a union shop can have top

non-union shops in an area, the
market rate for labor would in-
crease.

And while UPMC is healthy
ﬁnancially, other chains are not.
West Penn posted a $24.7 mil-
lion loss‘ last quarter. Smaller:
independent hospitals are suf-

-fering, as well. And with cuts to

medical providers now inevita-
ble because of President Barack
Obama’s Affordable Care Act
(you didn’t know that was part,
of the law?), these margins will
only further deteriorate.

In other words, higher wages
would destroy less viable com-
petitors, a one—way ticket to a
true UPMC monopoly on health
care in the region, an outcome‘
feared rightly by A everyone
across the political spectrum.

THE RlVETERi

Make 2013 a bit less predictable. Refrigerator.

Rosie McKinley
C0lum7zz'st

Some economics major would have a fun
time formulating a game theory scenar-
io for the situation I found myself in at
gate 89 of the Pittsburgh airport over the
break. The combination of homeward-
bound college students and Steelers fans
traveling to the Cowboys game meant
that my afternoon ﬂight to Dallas was
overbooked. Some of us ﬂiers would have
to stay behind for the later departure.
Being a lone traveler without a con-
necting ﬂight to make, I did something I
too often don’t: I broke my schedule. And
in the subsequent six hours I spent alone
inrthe airport, I rediscovered the impor-

’ tance of unscheduled time.

Over the past three and a half years,
my relative success in school an'd at
work has been the function of carefully
planned daily schedules. A constant pre-
occupation with sticking to the plan has
made me a successful college senior, but
it has also imprisoned me to an artiﬁcial,
caffeine-induced stimulation that has
propelled me through 18—credit semes-
ters and midnight deadlines.

But as April 28 looms, I can’t shake

_ the feeling that in my incessant pursuit

In a college environment that divides

I don’t mean to say that college should

cation is supremely valuable, and I’m
quite grateful for the degree that I’ll re-
ceive at the culmination of my studies.

COLUMN .

Are We on the edge of a revolution in higher education?

Tiemoko Ballo
Colummst

i If you’ve ever seen a TEDtalk, Googled a-

scholarly ‘source or looked up a “how to”
video on YouTube, you’ve already beneﬁted
from the new phenomenon that is open
education. The open movement aims to
make quality education accessible to ev-
eryone ‘with an Internet connection and a

little bit of ‘ motivation, regardless of fac-
tors such as location, language, disability,

time constraints and ﬁnancial situation.
But the implications of free knowledge are
limited. While open models are increasingly
necessary in our society and increasingly
viable as teachirigmethods, free access to
information will not necessarily level the
playing ﬁeld or equalize opportunity.

, Accessible higher learning is something
we desperately need. According to the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics, the cost of higher
education in the U.S. has increased a whop-
ping 559 percent since 1985; that’s almost
twice the increase rate of healthcare cost
and almost four times that of all consumer
items. Traditional higher education is rap-
idly becoming extremely expensive, and
thus, extremely exclusive. Furthermore,
conventional class schedules aren’t feasible

for many Americans, including full-time

employees, parents and geographically
distant students. ‘ *
Open education provides an important
alternative to the conventional model.
Large—scale, open programs such as MIT’s
0penCourseWare, Rice University’s Con-
nexions and Apple’s iTunes U app have

the ability to connect any willing student

‘ to high—quality resources and materials.

The result is distance learning accessible

to almost anyone and scalable to almost.

any need. » 1

Not only is open education convenient,
it is quickly becoming a legitimate way to
learn: The online classroom can offer the
same level of engagement and interaction
as its on—campus counterpart. Coursera.
org — a free online educational system that
currently supports 2 million active students
across 196 different countries — mimics
the classroom experience with homework
deadlines, interactive activities and detailed
exams. The site employs instant machine
grading of mathematical expressions,
short-answer questions, models and even
projects. Since computers can’t provide
feedback on lengthy critical writing, the
site utilizes peer grading and student-driven
forums to facilitate both discussion and
collaboration. '

Coursera’s lecture system is also more
ﬂexible than the conventional hour—long
block dictation. Students can choose from
several brief presentations regarding topics
within a course. Some videos form the core
course, some review an area in preparation

4 for the main lectures,‘ and some delve into

the details of a speciﬁc area that might be of
interest to a particular pupil. Daphne Koller,
a Stanford professor and Coursera’s co-

-founder, believes that this ability to tailor
learning to the needs of an individual is a

major advantage of open education. During
her talk at the TEDGlobal 2012 conference,
she stated that online education “allows
us to break away from the one—size—ﬁts—all

model of education and allows students

to follow a much more personalized‘ cur-
riculum.” ,
While open education meets an array
of needs in an effective way, it is far from
the societal cure—all-it’s often marketed as.
Universal access to information will not
solve .disparities of wealth because acces-
sible knowledge does not translate directly
into increased opportunity. The problem is
that education for the sake of broadening
knowledge and education for the sake of
accreditation are two different pursuits,
and employers favor the latter. Our society
attaches great value to _a traditional degree

from an established institution, so even if
an individual takes advantage of open edu-
cation resources, this form of learning will
not grant the same employment options as
a conventional degree. Sites like Coursera
might offer certiﬁcates of completion, but-*
the market value of such credentials is, at
present, dubious. Open education breaks
down barriers, but not those that limit de-
sirable employment and ﬁnancial gain.
And if we did reach a point where an
open education certiﬁcate carried a‘ value
equal to that of a traditional degree, what
would that mean for the education industry?
How could a traditional university support
itself and fund research if the product it
offers is available elsewhere at no cost?
It’s hard to imagine a realistic scenario in
which the availability of completely free’
college degrees doesn’t destroy the very

g institutions that make them possible.

Open education is a noble cause, it dis-
solves learning barriers and connects in-
dividuals to quality resources at no cost.
It also presents a viable and comparably
effective method of learning. But it does not
mean equal opportunity and social mobility
for all. Open education does not provide a
realistic alternative to a four-year degree
and is not likely to do so anytime soon. I

"»'?>'s* Aside from destroying competitors,
artiﬁcially higher wages would distort
the labor market in ways that may harm
lower-income workers.

After all, if a certain "pool of individu-
als is willing to do a job for $10 an hour

_ ___and you raise the rate to $12 an hour, you

have expanded that pool of individuals.
The employees attracted by that $2 raise
will largely not be lower-income but mid—
dle-income individuals. Suddenly, entry-
level jobs have become more competitive
for the lowest earning; raising this bar

and making it harder for those at the‘bot-
tom of the economic ladder to climb is
morally unconscionable.

Finally, the last thing you want to do
in any industry is make it less produc-
tive. As a nation, we already spend more
than any other on health care —’ for ques-
tionable beneﬁt, at times. Do we want to
spend even more on healthcare, a seg-
ment that already consumes 18 percent of
the economy? The sector is already going

to bankrupt the nation as baby boomers V
retire -— there is no reason to speed up.,

this outcome.

I doubt this column will convince many
of the activists. UPMC’s proﬁts just seem
too 'big. It’s just unfair. But what these
critics must realize is that big proﬁts at a

hospital are like big proﬁts anywhere -
they go into reinvestment and, ultimate-
ly, more positive health outcomes.

A hospital without proﬁts is a hospi-
tal that is doing a poor job administering
care. A hospital with proﬁts is one that
can reinvest and plan for the future.

UPMC is not totally innocent, and as
always, the criticisms contain a kernel of
wisdom. As reported in the Post—Gazette
last fall, the chain holds vast amounts

of tax-exempt land, often sitting vacant.

Given that this landlisn’t being used for
the purpose of improving patient’s lives,
the land’s exemptionlfrom property taxa-
tion ‘is against the spirit ‘of the law. If
UPMC wants to run a 1and—ﬂipping enter-
prise, it should be taxed as such.

Also, if allegations are true that UPMC
isn’t offering chances for more tenured
employees to use the skills they have
developed to advance to better job posi-
tions, then the hospital must change. Not
only does this rob workers of wages, but
also it represents a serious amount of
wasted human capital. " 

- Criticism of 'a foodpantry program,
one that has apparently been much ap-
’ preciated at UPMC Mercy for years, is
. misguided and truly rrrean—spirited. Mag-
ic wage increases are not a solution to any
problem, and if workers truly are having
a ‘difficult time climbing the economic
ladder, the solutions lie ‘beyond the per-
ceived stinginess of any one organization.

FILM REVIEW

‘Hitchcock’ demonstrates clirector’s love story, movie making

Brett Murphy
S taﬁ” W riter

“Hitchcock”
Directed by: Sacha Gervasi

«Starring: Anthony Hopkins,

Helen l\/lirren, Scarlett
Johansson, Danny Huston
Grade: B

He was a visionary of ﬁlm and a pioneer

' that didn’t subscribe to genre — he called

his style “self plagiarism.” But like most
great artists, including Ernest Hemingway
andjackson Pollock, Alfred Hitchcock, the
paradigm auteur, was not without his de-
mons.

 In his quasi—directorial debut, Sacha

Gervasi embeds the torment, obsessions,
idiosyncrasies, and many foibles of the
ﬁlm genius into a love story. The ﬁlm runs
just 98 minutes, which would be enough
time for a less ambitious character exami-
nation, but it isn’t enough to let the con-
ﬂicts of “Hitchcock” breathe. Although
the juggling act between chronicled pro-
ﬁle and romantic battle seems hurried at
times, Anthony Hopkin’s performance as
the protagonist makes this cinematic look
at a ﬁlm giant worth the watch.

Anthony Hopkins acts as the legendary director Alfred Hitchcocl< in “Hitchcock.”

In the ﬁlm, Hitch (“hold the cock,”
the famous director tells people) begins
doubting himself after the success of his
latest ﬁlm, “North by Northwest,” with the
somewhat trite question, “Am I getting too
old for this?” The press thinks he should
just quit while he’s ahead. However, this
might seem like a crazy idea, as the direc-

riage andp“Psycho” to survive, they’ll need
to gain control of their fantasies.

“Hitchcock” is most successful in its‘

unblinking homage to voyeurism — the
chilling sense of watching and surveillance
that made Hitchcock a master of the cam-
era in ﬁlms such as “Rear Window.” There
are striking scenes of the director sitting
just feet away during the ﬁlming of some of
the most iconic scenes in “Psycho.”
“Hitchcock” is a solid ﬁlm fueled by the
performances of its actors. It often suffers
from drawn-out moments, but Mirren and

cover more than just a mountain ﬁlled with
treasure. “I miss my books, and my arm-
chair, and my garden,” Bilbo tells them.
“See, that’s where I belong; that’s home,
and that’s why I came, ’cause you don’t
have one  a home. It was taken from you,
but I will help you take itlback, if I can.”

As always, McKellen acts like a per-
severing caretaker as Gandalf, and when
the dwarves and Bilbo get into trouble, he
works his magic to get them out of it.‘ Ar-
mitage, playing the leader of the dwarves,
is a good casting choice for the dwarf king.
He resonates an authority that is similar to
Aragorn’s in the “Lord of the Rings” tril-
ogy — an authority that fans expect from
a king.

“An Unexpected Journey” remains true
to the cheerfully optimistic tone of “The

Hobbit,” which contrasts with the more
somber and sinister depiction of Middle-
earth in “The Lord of the Rings.”

‘ “An Unexpected Journey” doesn’t con-
tain the same sort of intense plot and vio-
lent battles as depicted by “The Lord of
the Rings” trilogy, but that’s because Mid-

dle-earth is not yet under attack. The 13

dwarves laugh, sing boisterously and over
drink —' all things that don’t happen as
frequently in “The Lord of the Rings.” But
“The Hobbit” only leads to the epic tril-
ogy; it does not replicate it. It is supposed
to be light and fun, and the silly nature of
the movie imitates the lighthearted tone of
the book. _ '

While “An Unexpected Journey” may
not live up to the expectations of those
looking for another installment of “The
Lord of the Rings,” it certainly creates an
accurate representation of Middle-earth
for fans loyal to the trilogy and its prequel.

' The 49-point victory set the all-time

Moore said. '

It didn’t look good for the Pitt football team
when it was announced that star senior
running back Ray Graham was one of three
players —— along with starting linebacker
Shane Gordon and backup tight end Drew

.Carswell — who would miss the Panthers’

bowl game because of injury.

It looked worse when Pitt quarterback
Tino Sunseri threw an interception on the
game’s ﬁrst drive, destroying any hopes the
Panthers had of getting off to a good start.

And by the time the two teams shook
hands at the end of the BBVA Compass
Bowl on Saturday afternoon, the Panthers’

third consecutive trip to the bowl in Bir— '

mingham, Ala., had turned into a-disap-
pointing experience, ,as Pitt (6-7) ﬁnished
the season with a losing record after get-
ting dominated by Ole Miss, 38-17.
Sunseri’s early interception, which was
his ﬁrst since September, set the tone for

the whole game. The Rebels (7-6) scored"
l the opening touchdown a few plays later as

more than 50,000 Ole Miss fans at Legion
Field made the contest feel like a Rebels
home game.

Ole Miss quarterback Bo Wallace, who
was later chosen as the game’s MVP, ‘then
threw his second of three touchdowns to
double the Rebels’ lead, but Pitt showed
some life in the second quarter when Sun-

seri found wide receiver Devin Street for a

‘_score to halve the deﬁcit. ‘ '

But the Rebels instantly responded with
another quick scoring drive to make the
score 21-7, and the Panthers never got back
within 10. _ b

With the result now beyond doubt,
most Pitt fans’ attention focused on wheth-'
er Sunseri would pass legendary quarter-
back Dan Marino for second place on the
school’s all-time passing list.

The current Pitt quarterback found
fellow senior Mike Shanahan inthe end
zone late in the fourth quarter as Sunseri
stretched his career passing total to 8,590
yards —-- just seven shy of Marino’s mark.
But Ole Miss ran out the clock on the en-
suing possession and Sunseri ﬁnished his
career as the University’s third-leading
passer. . _ ‘

Despite his injury, Graham ﬁnished
the season as Pitt’s second all—time leader
rushing, behind V only Heisman Trophy
winner Tony Dorsett. ‘

The loss marked back-to—bacl< losing
Pitt football seasons for the ﬁrst time since
1999, but head coach Paul Chryst and the
Panthers will hope that a strong recruiting

class and a new life in the Atlantic Coast 1

Conference can help return the program to
winning ways next season. ‘

Pitt will begin the 2013 campaign
against Villanova at Heinz Field on Satur-
day, Aug. 31. I

Berenato breaks school all—time coaching wins record over break

Dave Uhrmacher & Tyler Pecyna
The Pitt News Staff

A lot went well for the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team over the winter break.

Head coach Agnus Berenato broke the
program’s all—time wins record, Pitt had
an offensive explosion to record its best

shooting game since 2009 and the Pan— '

thers picked up their ﬁrst two road victo-
ries of the season.

But like last season, when Pitt failed to
earn a single Big East win, the Panthers
didn’t turn that holiday momentum into
conference success, as they lost their Big
East opener at Seton Hall.

Rider 6:, pm 43

V The Pitt women’s basketball team lost
for just the second time this season at the
Petersen Events Center on Dec. 16, fall-
ing after a dominant second-half perfor-
mance by Rider University.

Pitt (6-4) jumped out to a 9-2 lead
against the Broncs (5-4), connecting on 4

_ of 8 shots in the first five minutes of the

game. While the Panthers squandered the
early lead with poor shooting and costly

turnovers, their opponents caught ﬁre
toward the end of the half.

The 65—48 loss marked Pitt’s second
failed attempt to earn Berenato her.re—
cord—breaking 159th victory as the leader
of Pitt women’s basketball. This chance
came against the school Coach Berenato
began her coaching career with in 1981,
but the result was lackluster in her eyes.

“Today was a really disappointing loss
for us,”,Berenato said after the game. “We
came out [playing strongly] in the ﬁrst
couple of possessions, but then we went
stagnant. Once we went stagnant; we
missed a shot and it became contagious.”

After falling behind early,» the Broncs
outscored the Panthers by nine in the-
remaining 15 minutes of the ﬁrst half,
but the Panthers trailed by just two at
the break by limiting Rider’s best player,
Caitlin Bopp. The Broncs’ senior cen-
ter played only five minutes in the half
after recording two fouls in the game’s
ﬁrst two minutes. Her absence allowed
the Panthers to out—rebound Rider in the
ﬁrst half. " .

But Bopp logged 16 second-half min-

Panthers begin conference

season with two solid wins

and Clarion over break. Claire Deahl | Staff Photographer ’

The holidays didn’t bring the Pitt wrestling
team much of a rest. The Panthers extend-
ed their match winning streakto four, ﬁn-

ished 10th out of 48 schools at the Midlands .

Championships and had three wrestlers
earn spots on the podium at the tournament
during the winter break. '

‘ With the impressive results, the Pan'-
thers have moved up two spots to No. 13
in the national rankings heading into what
should be a successful 2013 for the Pitt

wrestling program.

Pitt 38, Cleveland State 6

Pitt’s winter break started with its ﬁrst
home Eastern Wrestling League (EWL)
match of the season, and the three-time
defending conference champions cruised
through Cleveland State.

In a continuing theme for the Panthers,
the match didn’t start out too well as God-
win Nyama lost 8-5 to Cleveland State’s Ben
Willeford.

Behind by an escape and two third—peri-
od takedowns, No. 16 Shelton Mack got Pitt
on the scoreboard with a major decision, 12-
4, over Mike Marlone. p

Corey Bush took to the mat for the ﬁrst
time this season for Pitt but had a disap-
pointing debut. The 141—pounder fell to
Nick Flannery, 6-1, and the Warriors took a
6-4 match lead.

Fortunately for Pitt, that -would be the
last match Cleveland State would win.

The Panthers had no trouble in the ﬁnal
seven matches, as they tallied two major de-
cisions, a technical‘ fall and three pins.

Unlike Bush, who; was unable to get a
victory in his ﬁrst start, redshirt junior P._].
Tasser stepped into the starting lineup and
recorded a pin over Bobby Blankenship at
3:12.

C “We stay prepared for anything and
everything because you never know what
could happen in the lineup,” Tasser said.
“Our coaches do a great job of helping us
stay focused on the goals we set as a team
and push us to fulﬁll them.” ‘

All season long, the Panthers have been i

excelling at the higher weight classes, and
Tasser looked well-prepared stepping in for

V No. 14 Max Thomusseit. _ a

“When you have teammates like mine,
it is easy to stay focused,” Tasser said. “Ul-
timately, we all want another conference
championship and to get back to NCAAs.”

_ The wrestling team didn’t have long to
celebrate the dominant victory over Cleve-
land State before boarding a bus to take on
Clarion the next day. ‘

fellow teammates.

“We’ve seen a lot of progress from [Ad-
ams],”. Moore said. “He’s ﬁnishing high at
the basket more. We emphasize on him to
ﬁnish with his left hand in practice. He’s
doinga very good job of that.”,

Pitt 71, Delaware State 43

For much of the ﬁrst half of the Pitt if

men’s basketball team’s game against Del-
aware State, the loudest noise in the Pe-
tersen Events Center was that of sneakers
squeaking on the court ﬂoor.

Such was the lack of atmosphere com-
ing from the few dozen students in the
Oakland Zoo and the announced 9,522 fans
who attended what ended up being yet an-
other lopsided December basketball game
between Pitt and a mismatched mid—major
opponent. ‘ . i

What the restless crowd needed was
for the Panthers to stop playing as though
it were another meaningless early season
game.

After allowing the Hornets (5-7, 1-0
Mid—Eastern Athletic Conference) to stick
around in a sloppy ﬁrst half, the Panthers
(11-1) got the fans excited with some high-
ﬂying dunks, pulling away in the second
half to stretch their winning streak to sev-

his team, despite the dominant victory.
“We know we’ve got a long way to go,”

Dixon said after the game. ‘‘We’ve got a lot

of improvements to make, and we got a lot

of new guys that are getting better and ﬁg— 

uring things out.”

At the very beginning of the game, it
appeared that the contest would resemble
Pitt’s most recent two wins — a 42-point
thumping of North Florida and a 49-point
shellacking of Bethune-Cookman —— as the
Panthers jumped out to a 10-3 lead.

But turnovers slowed Pitt’s offense,
and Delaware State ﬁnally started making
shots. After a 12-4 run, the Hornets had
their ﬁrst — and only, as it turned out -
lead of the game.

Redshirt junior Lamar Patterson felt
that the Panthers were trying to make too
many intricate passes during that stretch,
which resulted in the number of turnovers.

“The ﬁrst half we weren’t patient, so
we had a few turnovers,” Patterson said.
“Forcing the ball led to turnovers.”

When the Panthers did get shots off in"‘
the ﬁrst half, they usually scored. Pitt con-
verted 13-of-19 ﬁeld goal attempts to shoot
an impressive 68.4 percent in the game’s
opening 20 minutes.

That high success rate probably
stemmed from the fact that many of the
team’s buckets were dunks. g

Moore and Talib Zanna ﬁnished slams
on back—to—back possessions for the Pan-
thers to break an 18-18 tie, and Pitt never

en games with a 71-43 victory.

Malcolm Gilbert lat

it to

announce decision to transfer

Jasper Wilson -
Assistant Sports Editor

Malcolm Gilbert,‘ a second—year Pitt men’s
basketball player, will transfer. ,

According to a statement from Pitt on
Dec. 28, Gilbert has decided to transfer
because he wants to play with his brother.
His brother, Marcus Gilbert, is a freshman
at Fairﬁeld University, according to the
school’s website.

The Delaware native was redshirting this
year after having averaged 0.8 points and
0.8 rebounds per- game over 93 minutes last
season. He appeared in 19 games.

Head coachjamie Dixon wished him well.

« “Malcolm has asked for his release and
has informed me that he wants to play with
his brother,” Dixon said. “He’s a great kid,
hard worker and good player. We thank Mal-
colm for_his contribution to. our program
over the last year and a half and wish him

‘ much success in the future.”

Gilbert was a popular ﬁxture on the Pitt
campus, inspiring his own subsection of the
Oakland Zoo: Malcolm’s Maniacs.

Gilbert is the third player from the 2011
recruiting class to transfer. Current ‘UNLV
player Khem Birch departed last December,

' and more recently, John Johnson left this

November. Johnson has since decided to
play at Penn State. I '

State managed-to stay close, but the Pan-

‘ thers scored the ﬁrst 10 points of the sec— .

0nd half to open up a double-digit advan-

_ tage for the ﬁrst time in the game.

Coach Dixon was much more pleased
with how his team played in the second
half. ' it .

“We got better in the second half —— ob-
viously played really well,” Dixon said. “I
thought we did a good job of getting the
ball inside, and that’s what we wanted to
do.” .

That vital run was sparked by Zanna,
who took advantage of inside passes dur-
ing the game to tie his career—high record
of 20 points.

“He’s ‘simpliﬁed his game,” Dixon said
of Zanna. “He lets things come to him and
gets to the right spot. He’s doing a really
good job, playing to his strengths and feel-
ing more comfortable.”

Along with Pitt’s ability to score inside
at will for much of the game, Delaware
State head coach Greg Jackson thought

3 their Big East schedule.

that talent and rebounding also affected
the game’s outcome.

_“I thought the talent level took over in '

the second half. Any time‘ you get out—re—
bounded 35-14, you’re not going to win the
ball game,” Jackson said.

Pitt 59, Kennesaw State 43
Coach Dixon earned his 250th career

victory, but the_ Panthers failed to impress
as they struggled offensively against lowly

Kennesaw State in their ﬁnal game before "

conference play.

Zanna was the only Panther who played
well, scoring 12 points and grabbing nine
rebounds. g

Pitt held a double—digit lead for most
of the contest, but the Panthers didn’t
dominate Kennesaw State — which lost its
10th straight game overall — like they had
against Bethune—Cookman and Delaware

utes and ﬁnished with seven points and
13 rebounds on the day. Rider, boosted
by Bopp’s increased time on the court,
dominated the second half by shooting
46.2 percent from the floor, outrebound—

' ing and outscoring Pitt by 12 in the paint.

Rider senior guard Sironda Chambers,
whose 3 of 4 successful shots in the sec-
ond half were indicative of the team’s ef-
ﬁcient play, led all scorers with 20 points.

The Broncs’ bench added 21 points -
paced by eight from senior guard Dior
Brown — while Pitt recorded only five
points from its substitutes.

Pitt sophomore guard Brianna Kie-
sel led the Panthers with 17 points, and
junior, Asia Logan scored 12 points and
grabbed 13 rebounds. Sunday marked
the junior forward’s second ‘consecutive
game with a doub1e—double.

The Panthers shot the ball better and
recorded fewer turnovers after a poor

3 first half, but the Rider offensive output

proved to be insurmountable.

‘ Taylor Wentzel, a Rider freshman
guard and Pittsburgh native, drove to
the basket and banked in a layup amidst
heavy contact with 9:58 remaining in the
contest. The layup started a 13-4 run for
the Broncs that resulted in a 54-43 lead,
all but sealing their fifth victory of the
season. -

“It was the shot that broke the camel’s
back,” Berenato said.

dominating 67-49 victory over her alma
mater, Mount St. Mary’s.

The win was the Panthers’ seventh of
the season, but the Petersen Events Cen-
ter scoreboard displayed “159 Wins!”
above the mass of lifted arms enveloping
Coach Berenato.

Berenato’s 159th win as, coach of the
Panthers surpasses the all-time wins re-

coached the Pitt women’s basketball team
from 1985 to 1998.-

Coach Berenato remained humble af-

From the onset, the Panthers con-

Cincinnati 70, Pitt’ 61

In the Big East opener, No. 24 Pitt fell
to No. 14 Cincinnati, 70-61, as the Bearcats

—- used a second—half surge to overtake the

Panthers.

Dixon called the New Year’s Eve contest
at the Petersen Events Center “a tale of two
halves.”

At halftime, Pitt (12-2, o-1 Big East) led
Cincinnati 34-26 with a dominant defen-
sive performance that pleased the raucous
crowd of 12,510, . including a rowdy and

nearly full Oakland Zoo. The Panthers kept -

the Bearcats’ offense in check by holding
it to 29.6 percent shooting, while Pitt shot
48 percent in the opening half.

4- But Cincinnati (13-1, 1-0 Big East) came

back strong in the second half, shooting
13-for-24 from the ﬁeld — 54.2 percent —-S
en route to scoring 44 second-half points
in comparison to Pitt’s 27. Cincinnati
started the second half with a six-nothing
run on the Panthers and carried its hot
second-half start all the way through to the
end of the game. '

Cincinnati gained its ﬁrst lead of the
game when Titus Rubles converted a layup
over Adams while drawing a foul on him.
After converting the and-one try, Cincin-

nati led 45-43, and the game never became
any closer. The Bearcats lead by as many as
10 points in the second half.

Patterson was one of three Panthers to
reach double-ﬁgure scoring, recording 13
points with four rebounds and four assists.
The redshirt junior forward summed up
the game by noting that Pitt did not match
Cincinnati’s intensity and toughness at the
start of the second half. W

— “They just got after it. We didn’t come
out the way we should have,” Patterson
said. “I’m not going to doubt our tough-
ness ever, but I felt like they were the
tougher team today.”

In addition to Patterson, Zanna led the
Panthers with 16 points, and Wright con-
tributed 10 points of his own off the bench.
A trio of Bearcats also put up double digits,
with point guard Cashmere Wright notch-
ing a game-high 18 points, Sean Kilpatrick
coming up short of his 18.8-points-per-
game average with 16 points and JaQuon
Parker chipping in 13.

Although the scoreboard reﬂected im-
pressive scoring performances, the crux
of Pitt’s Big East opener was the willing-
ness to ﬁght on both sides and the ability
to rebound the basketball —- both of which
Cincinnati proved superior at Monday.

“It was a hard-fought game on both
sides. They got to some of the loose balls

quicker than us, and got some of the re-

bounds,” Woodall said. _ I _
Overall, Cincinnati out-rebounded Pitt

. by seven —— 43 rebounds for Cincinnati to

cite the Panthers’ need to improve that
aspect of their game. Rebounding was one
part of how Dixon broke down the Pan-
thers’ second-half collapse, something
very uncharacteristic of a Pitt team.

“I don’t know how [getting outplayed

in the second half] can happen. That’s ’

usually something we don’t do. Year af-
ter year, we’ve seemed to come out in the
second half and ﬁnish what we started,”

Dixon said. “But give credit to Cincinnati.

They played hard, they out-rebounded us
by.nine in the second half, made their free
throws, knocked down shots‘ and really
beat us off the dribble.”

Like Dixon, Cincinnati head coach Mick
Cronin also believed rebounding played a
large part in the game as well as defense
overall. But the Bearcats made their larg-
est strides in the second half offensively,‘
shooting nearly double their ﬁrst-half rate

3 from the ﬁeld, which came as a result of

the team’s improved spacing on the ﬂoor.

“[Pitt] is a great defensive team. Their
help is always where it’s supposed to be,”
Cronin said. “Once we slowed down —- ob-
viously we try to run —— but once we slowed
down and got the matchup we wanted and
the spacing we wanted, you know we try to
attack them one—on—one more than with
set plays because they’ve always been this
way under Jamie. They are the best at de-
fending set offenses.” f

Those one—on—one matchups paid large
dividends for the Bearcats late, with Cash-
mere Wright knocking down a number of
jumpers from the perimeter to prevent the

Rutgers 67,_Pitt 62
The No. 24 Pittsburgh Panthers trav-

eled to Piscataway, N.]., Saturday in their
ﬁrst true road game of the season to take

on Big East foe Rutgers andhopefully even

their Big East conference record.

Unfortunately for Pitt, the Panthers
(12-3, 0-2 Big East) found themselves un-
able to right the ship as the Scarlet Knights
(9-3, 1-1 Big East) knocked them off at the
Louis Brown Athletic Center with a 67-62
victory. .

The Scarlet Knights used a hot start to
get the early edge on Pitt as, after Adams
opened the game with a layup, Rutgers put
up 12 unanswered points, keyed by a pair
of 3—pointers from Myles Mack and Dane
Miller.

Before Pitt hardly began, Rutgers held a
15-5 lead, which the Scarlet Knights would
extend to as many as 16 points later in the
half. ' -

Off the bench, Rutgers’ leading scorer

-Eli Carter notched 14 ﬁrst-half points,

which only added to Pitt’s halftime deﬁcit.

as the Panthers trailed 39-25.

Alongside the offense provided by Rut-
gers’ potent backcourt, the Scarlet Knights
also defended the Panther offense impres-
sively, holding Pitt to 30.6 percent shoot-
ing from the ﬁeld. The Panthers made only

a career-high seven assists while com-
mitting only one turnover in her ﬁrst-
ever start for the Panthers. Her perfor-
mance drew praise from her head coach.

“I have to give a shout-out to our
freshman, Brittany Gordon,” said Bere-
nato, who was ﬂanked by Logan and Kie-
sel both nodding in agreement. “[She]
really did a great job as a freshman run-
ning the team.” ’

Not only did Gordon and the rest of
the Panthers protect the ball on offense,
but they also outrebounded their op-
ponent by 12 -- including a career-high
15 boards from_ center Chyna Golden,

. forced 21 Mountaineer t1.lI'flOV€I‘S and 1'6-

corded 13 steals, all while keeping oppos-
ing guard Sydney Henderson in check.

The Mountaineers’ redshirt junior
star entered Thursday’s game averaging
16.4 points per game, but Henderson was
held to just four points on 2-for-7 shoot-
ing against a swarming Pitt defense.

Kiesel drew the assignment of guard-
ing Henderson. Defensively, she stymied
the talented guard and outscored her
with a total of 23 points. V

Kiesel also sparked the Pitt offense
— which had seen a double-digit lead
dwindle to only 9 points after a ﬁrst-half

3 buzzer—beating 3—pointer from Mount St.

Mary’s junior forward Jessie Kaufman
4- by drawinga foul on a layup less than
two minutes into the_ second half. After a
successful free throw, Kiesel contributed
six more points and an assist on the next
four Pitt offensive possessions.

The Panthers lost two straight games
before earning Coach Berenato her 159th
victory at Pitt, but Kiesel said she felt this
win was the product of determination.

“We worked really, really hard,” Kie-
sel said. “We had two tough losses and
the coaching staff really helped us to get
back where we were. Getting Coach B this

' win is just joyful going into the holidays.” 5

Though Coach Berenato was per-

sistent in praising the all—around pro-

duction from the Panthers, she took a
moment to reflect positively on the be-
ginning of her tenure at Pitt in light of
the coaching milestone.

“I appreciate that 10 years ago Chan-
cellor [Mark] Nordenberg had the cour-
age and blind faith in me to hire me,” she

said. “It was a big move for me to move,

my family. I have ﬁve kids, and they were
all little. I did it because I felt such an un-
believable warmth from the people, and
it’s been a great experience for me.”

Pitt 91, Buffalo 77

The Panthers recorded a regular-sea-

son high 91 points in a victory over the
Buffalo Bulls on Dec. 29 to pick up their
first road win of the season.

Five players scored in double ﬁgures
for Pitt (Kiesel, Briggs, Andersen, Logan,
Gordon), and the team recorded its high-
est ﬁeld goal percentage (60.3 percent)
in a single game since a 61.4 percent ef-
fort against Western Michigan on Dec.
5, 2009. The Panthers (8-4) also shot a
season-high 50 percent from beyond the
arc. '

The offensive outburst was the second
in a row for the Panthers after beating
Mount St. Mary’s by 18 points nine days
before. A smooth Pitt shooting day in

Buffalo in all phases, the Panthers were
16-for-20 from the free-throw line, al-
lowing them to coast to their ﬁnal ‘victory
in the calendar year of 2012.

The Panthers overcame a double-digit
margin and beat Old Dominion 55-54 on
Wednesday, Jan. 2, in the middle game of

ﬁnal ﬁve matches to pick up the 26-15 match
victory and improve to 2-0 in EWL competi-
tion.

Mack picked up Pitt’s only win in the
ﬁrst ﬁve matches with an 8-5 decision over
Joe Waltko. _

“My match was important because .it
helped get some points on the board at the
lower weights,” Mack said.

The sophomore 133—pounder has been
in high—pressure situations all season being
the Panthers’ only ranked wrestler in the
ﬁve lower weightclasses. But he doesn’t let

that pressure affect him on the mat.

“I don’t feel the pressure,” Mack said. “I
just try to go out there, Win and give the guy
after me more conﬁdence.” ’

Even more important for the Panthers
may have been Donnie Tasser’s close loss
against No. 3]ames Fleming.

The 157-pound Tasser wrestled , two

‘scoreless periods with the third-ranked A

wrestler before giving up three near-fall
points and the loss. Holding Fleming to only
a decision kept the Panthers in the match.

No. 14 Tyler Wilps connected on a late
takedown near the edge of the circle that
pushed the lead to the necessary eight
points for the major decision. With that
win, the Pitt comeback began.

triumphs by No. 2 Matt Wilps and No. 8 Zac

Thomusseit.
Midlands‘Champio_nships

With two conference match wins
wrapped up, the Panthers headed to the
Midlands Championships at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill.‘

Matt Wilps and Zac Thomusseit both
turned in second-place ﬁnishes in a very
competitive tournament.

Wilps won his ﬁrst four matches, includ-

ing a 4-3 victorydover No. 11 Kyven Gadson 1
of Iowa State and a 7-0 victory over Oregon ‘

State’s No. 10 Taylor Meeks, setting himself
up for a championship matchup with Kent

‘ . State’s No. 1 Dustin Kilgore.

Kilgore, the 2011 197-pound national
champion, took an Olympic redshirt last
year and finished fourth in Olympic trials to
make the U.S. team. Needless to say, Kilgore
presented Wilps with a challenge,

' The two wrestled a close match, but V

Kilgore pulled out the 4-2 victory, giving
Wilps his ﬁrst loss of the season.

The Pitt senior now has some ﬁlm to
watch on a few top competitors at his
weight class and knows what he needs to
work on to achieve his goal of being the na-
tional champion.

“Midlands gave a good preview to the
competition at nationals and revealed'some
techniques I need to improve on,” Wilps
said.

Zac Thomusseit’s opponentin the cham-
pionship wasn’t nearly as decorated as
Kilgore, but No. 6 Chad Hanke of Oregon
State still provided the Pitt heavyweight
with a huge opportunity.

Zac Thomusseit lost a 3-2 decision as the
Panthers’ hopes of having a champion at the
Midlands Championships disappeared.

‘ “I had a slip-up in the ﬁnals, but I’m us-
ing it as motivation,” Zac Thomusseit said.

1 “It makes me stop, reevaluate what rm

doing and what I need to work on coming
down the home stretch.” - .
Pitt’s heavyweight, along with several
other wrestlers, have been very successful
this season, and suffering their ﬁrst loss
gives them an opportunity to improve.
“When you’_re winning, it’s hard to judge
what things need tuned up,”
Zac‘Thomusseit said. “So my ﬁrst loss of
the season is helping me ﬁx up some minor
things that I am doing wrong.”
Pitt’s Anthony Zanetta, who is redshirt-

ing this year, also competed in the tourna- P

ment and earned an eighth-place ﬁnish.
He was the only other Panther.to reach the
championship’s eight—man podium.

The Panthers will look to build of the
experience they got against the tough com-
petition going forward.

‘ eight of their 26 ﬁeld goal attempts in the

ﬁrst half as the Scarlet Knights focused on
preventing Zanna and Adams from receiv-
ing the ball in scoring positions. -
Rutgers’ efforts worked: Zanna wa
held scoreless in the ﬁrst, and Adams only

' posted four points.

Despite the score, Rutgerslalso played
sloppily in the ﬁrst half, turning the ball
over eight times and relinquishing what
could have been a no-contest game head-
ing to the second half. Fortunately for Pitt,
Rutgers’ disregard for ball security car-
ried into the second half, and the Scarlet
Knights turned the ball over ﬁve times on
their ﬁrst ﬁve possessions of the half.

With Rutgers gifting Pitt the ball, the
Panthers capitalized by opening the sec-
ond half on a 9-0 run to cut thelhome
team’s lead to ﬁve points.

Pitt managed to minimize the scoring
gap to as few as three points after Patter-
son laid the ball in to pull the score to 45-

42.with just over eight minutes left in the .

game.

But out of Rutgers’ timeout, a jumper
by Wally Judge, a layup from Mack and a
jumper from Mike Poole helped Rutgers
reassert itself by pushing the lead back up
to seven points and taking away all the mo-
mentum Pitt gained in the ﬁrst 12 minutes
of the half.

However, Pitt battled back again, com-
ing within two points of the lead after Ad-
ams slammed a lob home from Woodall,
changing the score to 55-53 with a little
more than three minutes to play.

From the three-minute mark on, how-
ever, Rutgers made 10—of-13 free throws
to hold onto its lead and take home what
some might consider an upset victory over
the Panthers, who will likely be upranked
after losing both of their games this week.

Pitt’s next contest will be on the road,
this time at the Verizon Center in Washing-
tonlas the Panthers take on another ranked
opponent in the form of the ‘No. 15—ranked

Riding a three-game win streak into
its Big East opener, the Pitt women’s bas-

to four, losing to the Seton Hall Pirates by

a score of 69-56. ‘ ’
The third game on a week—long road
trip —.in which the Panthers (9-5, 0-1

Big East) had traveled to and won at Buf- _

falo and Old Dominion — marked the
first game of conference play in the ﬁnal
season~Pitt will compete in the Big East

before making the move to the Atlantic

‘ Coast Conference.

The loss did not come without an-
othervsolid all-around effort from star
forward Logan. She recorded her-sixth
double-double of the season, posting a

game—high 21 points to go along with 10 ,

boards. Junior guard Marquel Davis re-
corded 11 points.

Seton Hall (6-8, 1-0 Big East) was led
by 19 points from'Brittany Morris.
