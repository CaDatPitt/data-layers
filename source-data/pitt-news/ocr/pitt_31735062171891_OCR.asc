Earlier last week, much con-
troversy had been generated by
the Miniest Mini Contest. Advo-

labeled the contest “sexist” and
had sought the cancellation of the
event.

Though Circle K officials would
not cancel the contest. they did
agree to open the competition to
males. The winner. only male

THE POSSIBLE formation of a student lobby in Harrisburg was dis-
cussed by representatives from the Pennsylvania Association of Col-
lege and University Student Governments at Harrisburg Area Col-

lege Saturday.

Student Association Programs Commissioner Dennis Concilla, a
delegate to the conference, said the meeting’s purpose was “to in-
crease communication between all state institutions leading, hope-

fully to a lobby in Harrisburg.”

Concilla reported that a constitution had been drafted by the
group and that a copy would be sent to every student government

in the state for input.

“Tentatively,” said Concilla, “each college would receive one
representative per 10,000 students, with colleges having an enroll-
ment smaller than this amount still receiving one representative. All
of this is subject to the constitution’s ratification.

The Association's Steering Committee is scheduled to review the
constitutuin in Harrisburg April 17.

Slated for May 15-17 at Pitt is a convention of the Associa-
tion to discuss the constitution and possibly to gain the University's

support.

PESO Moves To SU

Center Coordinates Career,
Grad School Counseling

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

As part of its attempt to coordi-
nate the various departments of
post-graduate counseling avail-
able for students. the University
has decided to move PESO from
its office within the College of
Arts and Sciences to the Counsel-
ing Center.

The decision to move the office.
which is concerned with counsel-
ing undergraduates on graduate
school opportunities. was made
last Tuesday at a meeting of Bern-
ard Kobosky. Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs‘. Dr. Robert Gal-
lagher of the Counseling Center;
Jerome Schneewind. dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences. and
other administrators concerned
with undergraduate counseling.

Gallagher explained why the
center is best located within coun-
seling. rather than in the College.

“This office (Counseling Cen-
ter) reaches all the students,
rather than just those in the Col-
lege. We take them as part of our
responsibility; the College did
not. lt’s rather a natural tie-in
with our Career Counseling Cen-
ter Proposal.”

The Career Counseling Center
proposal. in the works for several
weeks. seeks to make career
counseling more effective by cen-
tralizing all counseling services.

ELECTIONS for chairman and
deputy chairman of the Black
Action Society (BAS) will be
held Tuesday, March 30, at the
Student Union Information
Desk and in the BAS office
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Stu-
dents must present an ID card
to vote.

Candidates for chairman in-
clude: David Berkley, Jerry
Cotten, George 5X, Ronnie
Hill, Rich Utley and Robert
Thompson.

Deputy chairman candidates
are: Bernard Mack, Ed Smith,
Albert Watts, Theopoleis Wil-

For personal statements by
the candidates, see pages two
and three.

   

Career Library. and the Counsel-
ing Center. in one location.

Dan McFadden, executive assis-
tant to Kobosky_ said the proposal
is part of the University‘s desire
to "put more emphasis on career
counseling and post-baccalaure-
ate education information.

Administrators felt there was a
need for this new emphasis be-
cause of the increasing difficulty
students have had in obtaining
jobs after graduation.

"The market has been diffi-
cult." said McFadden. "We feel
we have to reach the undergrad-
uates earlier and have discussions
with them on what is available in
the way of jobs and fellowships.

In Case

 

 

According to McFadden, the
proposal seeks to centralize the
existing counseling centers in or‘-

der to “make counseling less an:
and

administrative procedure
more a coordinated and integrat-
ed approach in assisting under-
graduates make career choices.

The Counseling Center liopes to
obtain some new personnel to help
increase the value and efficiency
of Career Counseling.

Gallagher would like to hire a‘ A

Career Information specialist
who would have the reponsibility
of counseling undergraduates on
employment opportunities. The
specialist would develop such pro-
grams as recruiting upperclass-
men to
groups with freshmen and sopho-

mores and coordinating a pro-'
gram with the Placement Center .-

to help seniors prepare for job in-
terviews and publishing a weekly
newsletter on job opportunities.

McFadden said that the Center

would probably have to hire some—  '

one to f'ile letter of recommenda-
tion for students and other career
and fellowship information.

In addition, the Counseling Cen- ‘ 

ter has considered the possibility
of hiring someone to coordinate
all the counseling programs and

to work with Gallagher in devel-_-
oping a long-range integrative ca-

reer counseling program.

Of Fire? 

THOUGH REPORTED by a Campus policeman, this fire extinguisher on the
third floor of the Student Union has remained useless for over a month.
Perhaps an administrator will light a fire under a University repairman

before an arsonist ignites the third floor.

Watts Urges Communication

J (Editor's Note: The Pitt News re-
quested policy statements from all
candidates for chairman and dep-
uty chairman of the Black Action
Society, BAS. The resumes print-
ed below and on page three were
received from chairman hopefuls
Rich Utley and David Berkley and
deputy chairman candidates Albert
Watts, Albert Wynn, and Bernard
Mack.)

The primary problem presently
facing the Black populace at the
University of Pittsburgh is one of
communication. Inherent in the
urgent problem_ of communica-
tion are those problems which
have arisen because of a lack of
adequate means for the exchange
of information relevant to us all.

There are ways to allievate
these problems. One is re-estab-
lishment of the BAS newspaper.
Another is by distributing flyers
regularly both on campus and in
the community. These can enable
Black students to know what ed-
ucational ‘ opportunities are open
to them, and what’s happening
with the BAS.

The BAS office should not al-
ways be on the fourth floor of
Schenley Hall. It should come
down to the students to find out
what they want and what prob-
lems they are having. ‘

Not only am I campaigning for
deputy chairman of the BAS but I
am recruiting new people to help
the BAS in its policies and all

‘ around daily activities. The BAS

is in need of new people on the

like to see new people with new
ideas taking an active part in its
functioning.

An organization that defines its
decision making functions as hav-
ing at least two categories (daily
functioning of the organization
and executive decision and policy
making) will be stronger and
more efficient. I would like to see
that theory applied to the admin-
istration of the BAS. Some of‘ the
pressure should be removed from
the chairman and put ‘ upon the
deputy chairman.

In the future perhaps there
could be a baby sitting service
here at the University. This can
service mothers who must bring
their children to school because
they cannot find a baby sitter, and
it can be expanded to help all
mothers in thecommunity.

I would like to see a counseling
service for high school students
in the area and a strengthening of
the now lagging tutorial program.

There should alos be commun-
ication with the rest of the Black
community. For instance they
could be told of the educational
possibilities available to them.
such as the UCEP program which
could help them to further their
education.

In summary the deputy chair-
man of BAS, if used effectively.
could strenghen the organization
while helping the campus and
community.

There are various reforms
which I would like to implement
as a functioning member of the

change needed is the position of

1-—All Black students shou

3——BAS must become a viable
channel of communications for
Black and white administrators

COMMUNITY
1-—BAS should have a strong
liaison with the leaders and peo-
ple of the Black communities.

2—More involvement of Black
students within the Black com-
munities.

BAS must use the mass media
for publicizing events and parti-
cularly achievements of Blacks
to the people. Thepeople of the
Black communities must now be
aware of what is happening on
campus by Black students.

Wynn Terms Positive’ Direction

Necessary For Black Action

As a candidate for deputy chair-
man of the BAS. I feel that it is
high time that BAS dealt with fun-
damental problems. The time for
rhetoric. super Blackness. and
apathy are over.

Black people are talking about
nation time. It seems to me that
this means action time—action
time for BAS. However. before
you can have action. you need di-
rection—positive direction. This
is what I want to contribute to
BAS. Thus my program deals with
basic problems and realistic solu-
tions.

I propose:
1) Greater involvement of Black
students through active recruit-

ment of all segments of the Black
student body.

2) Reorganization of BAS. We

The time has come for B.A.S.
to form new strategies which

Being stagnant over this last
year. has ttaused alert Black
minds to grow rusty. It has
caused many fellow students
to be uninterested and uninvolv-

We must forget out individu-
al differences. such as respective
fraternities. sororities and social
groups and unite collectively to
strengthen our academic and po-
litical positions on this campus.
and in the Black community

I am willing to tap the talents
of all who are willing to contri-
bute their skills to the cause of
saving the B.A.S. in these try-
ing times of institutions discard-

In terms of the involvement

deal with the power structure
but only with absolute stability.
No longer can the cry of growing

burgh must be able to carry out
our goals—As a functimal Black

vide a working mechanism

about the business of helping and
co-ordinating viable interests

Veterans Organize On Campus

by HEIDI LEVIN

A group of Pitt veterans has
filed for official University re-
cognition as a student organiza-
tion.

The veteran organization. known
as Veterans At Pitt (VAP). will
have a two-fold purpose. It will
help veterans in their transition
to civilian life. an_d it will also
aid in their adjustment to Pitt
and college life inlgeneral.

Eventually VAP hopes to have
its own core of counsellors for
those veterans seeking assistance
or guidance.

VAP will be working closely
with the Veterans Administra-
tion (VA) on campus, assisting
the VA in extending to all veter-

ans the benefits to which they
are entitled.

In addition to working with
the VA. VAP will be cooperat-
ing with the Pennsylvania Pro-
gram to Advance Veterans Edu-
cation (PAVE). PAVE is part of
a national program to inform
vetrans of the educational op-
portunities open to them. and
to encourage them to take ad-
vantage of those opportunities.

The VAP founders see the
possibility of their organizations
becoming the most diverse group
on campus. The organization is
coed. and membership is open
to graduate as well as under-
graduate veterans.

Mothers, Unite!

If she hires a babysitter, a mother with small children can work

‘~ , or study at the University. But, rather than leave their children in un-
“ professional hands, many mothers feel compelled to stay home.

Others, willing to trust a babysitter, lack the money to pay for

Still others search in vain for child-care facilities that don’t

V exist.

“We would have preferred to have the problem of day-care

,.:solved by government,” "Executive Assistant Chancellor Jack Free-

man declares. But prospects for government action, he concedes.
“dont seem terribly encouraging.”

if Nor has the administration completely ignored it. Starting this

 fall, it may be possible for 45-60 indigent undergraduate women to
“place their children in child—care facilities at the «Rodef Shalom
if Temple.

The project, proposed by the Advisory Committee on Women‘s

 .Opportunities (ACWO) and endorsed by the administration. requires

the University to pay one-fourth of the cost, with the federal govern-
ment funding the rest.

’ A Unquestionably, the step is in the right direction.

 But it does not grapple with he broader problem of child-care
forthe offspring of middle-class women at the University.

P Over a month ago, the ACWO urged the administration to make
child-care available to “all who need and desire child care - faculty.

.. ‘staff, administration, graduate, and undergraduate students.“

a The ACWO recommended more than sympathy: “Fees should be

fipaid by the university for those unable to pay up according to in-
” __come, so that people can pay according to their economic circum-

stances." ,
The administration has yet to express a financial or even philo-

sophical commitment to that key provision of the ACWO’s report.

C David Powers, Assistant to the Chancellor, has consulted and

“ . consulted on child-care. Provisions have been made for maternity
“leave and flexible working hours for women employees. But the
P basic child-care problem remains. I

“I don’t think we’ve thoroughly answered the question of how far
we are willing and able to go,” Freeman divulges.

Moreover, he argues, the administration must tackle some “very
complicated questions, which are not given to quick or easy solu-

The ACWO believes the administration has enough information
already to make a decision on child-care. “They now have what
they need to go ahead," Rae Saporin, an ACWO spokeswoman, said

A ‘Friday.

The Pitt News agrees. If we are convinced of the administra-

 tion’s concern, we are also convinced of its capacity for procras-

I . tination. ~

“Without child-care," members of the University Committee
on Women’s Rights argued two months ago, “the University system-

atically discriminates against women with child—rearing responsibili-

ties.”
With child-care geared to the destruction of sexual stereotypes.

-the University can light society"s way, as old values yield to new
mores.

To its credit, this University has taken strides toward eliminat-
ing the effects of centuries of discrimination against blacks.

Will the University correct injustices done to women with equal

‘ speed and enthusiasm?

This University cannot allow other institutions to set the pace.

The motives of any student for
attending an institute of higher
education are many and varied.
For most, it is the opportunity
for personal advancement which
education provides that draws
them. Others may choose to at-
tend college for the sake of their
parents, and still others may be
there to avoid the draft.

 

This last motive for continuing
one’s education may soon be
gone, however, when the Military
Selective Service Act of 1967 ex-
pires at the end of June. This
is the law which is the basis for
the present draft.

The expiration of this act may
sound the death knell for the II-S
student deferment, which enables
undergraduate students at an in-
stitute of higher learning to post-
pone their military obligation
until their education has been
completed.

For many," if the II-S defer-
ment is not renewed by Con-
gress, the expiration of this
deferment will have much the
same effect as the sword of
Damocles at a previous time in
history. Those with high lottery
numbers will feel little of

the despair likely to beset col-
lege students whose numbers
almost insure them of eventual
induction into the military.

CONGRESSIONAL
CONSCIENCE

For some, though, this writer
included, the expiration of the
student deferment will become
one of the most hopeful changes
the selective service system has
yet undergone.

On a national level, if con-
gress permits the II-S to expire,
it'would suggest that the law-
makers of this nation are finally
feeling some qualms of cons-
cience about the role they have
played in preserving a status-
quo that reeks of elitism, racism,
and a general policy of giving
more opportunity to those who
have already been given the
greatest opportunities this society
could provide.

Few discriminatory practices‘

in this nation have affected as
many as the inclusion of a stu-
dent deferment in the selective
service system. While this defer-

. ment is a boon to the college

student, it is a deficit to the

nation.

The II-S is a deferment one is
granted at birth, more than for
anything he does for the remain-
der of his life. If one were for-
tunate enough to be born to the
right parents, in the right place,
at the right time, the opportunity
to get a college education is a
birthright, not an achievement.

If, however, one had the mis-
fortune to be born into a ghetto
family of thirteen children, live
in a broken family, or belong to

any section of economically de—‘

prived class in this country, he

not only faced the reality that

college was something me dream-
ed about, but never realized,but

Student Defeirmients Scored,
Congressional Conscience Probed ("I

also could be assured of a term
in the armed forces in place of
someone who was given the op-
portunity for higher education.

The II-S, while being one of
the most extensively granted de-
ferments, fosters elitism be-

cause it discriminates against the
poor, blacks, and other historical-
ly slighted minority groups.

AN END TO APATHY

If one were to consider cancel-
lation of this deferment on a per-
sonal level, he might find that
this could be the tonic needed to
shake American college students
from the social and spiritual
lethargy which characterizes cam-

puses throughout the country to-ay.

For those who have supported
this country’s war policies in
Southeast Asia, it will provide
them an unexpected chance to
show their support through parti-
cipation.

For better, or for worse, if
the II-S deferment becomes non-
existent on June 30, many young-
Americans will be forced to take
a look at some of the realities
of their country that they have
long ignored.

appointment with a specialist in the Career Coun-

seling Center.

Benjamon Braddock, a senior --writing major.
is six months from graduation. He would like
to enter some area of communications, but is
not sure which one. Public relations? Journalism?
Advertising? Or should he go on to graduate
school to pick up courses in writing and ‘broad-
cast journalism so that he can better compete with
students with degrees in communications journal-
ism?

To get the information and advice he needs.
Benjamin will have to go to the PESO office to
obtain information on graduate schools of journal-
ism and fellowships. He will have to visit the
Placement Center to find out what opportunities
are open in the communications job market.
He will have to visit the Career Information Li-
brary to find out what kind of work is entailed in
various careers. Finally, he will have to make
an appointment at the Counseling Center to get
advice on the kind of career for which he is best
suited.

The whole process will be long and tedious
and cut into the time he needs to finish other
details involved with graduation. One should not
overlook the frustration he will probably encoun-
ter as he journeys from office to office.

counseling on the second floor of the Student
Union. Benjamin will have to make only one

In an effort to improve and facilitate counsel-
ing for students on career and graduate school
opportunities, the University has decided to move
the PESO office to the Counseling Center. In
addition there are plans to hire a Career Spec-
ialist who can publish weekly information on
career opportunities and coordinate the various
information received from the Career Library,
the Placement Center, and PESO.

The centralized office is a great improvement.
Students who previously chose to go it alone on
career decision rather than fight the bureacratic
hassles and frustrations entailed with visiting the
various centers will be more willing to take ad-
vantage of the aid the University has available
for them. Students will be better prepared to
try and enter a job market that is increasingly
difficult to enter. A

Unfortunately, the Counseling Center has to
wait until the new budget is finalized before it
can go ahead with many of its plans for increas-
ing the office and hiring new personnel. This
years graduating class must go without the new
services.

It would seem wise for the University to put
such a proposal at the head of its priorities and
give the Center the neeeded funds for an appro-
priate and much needed student service in a
critical period of a high job market.

Astro Turfers Plead 'Not Guilty’

Editor.

We have learned that a letter
from an organization called "Re-
sponsible Environmental Action
Program“ of Gonzalez, Fla.. was
published in your newspaper.
We feel your readers should know
Monsanto Company‘s position on
the matter.

It is apparent that the writer
did not have a complete’ under-

‘ standing of the present state of

pollution control at our Pensa-
cola, Fla., plant. For example.
as of last September. less than
two percent of the biochemical
oxygen demand OD) generat-
ed by plant operations was dis-
charged into the Escambia River.

This represents a reduction
of over 98 percent in total BOD

generated by the plant—the
equivalent of tertiary treatment.
The other categories of pollutants
noted in the letter were similarly
reduced.

The figures quoted in the let-
ter were those which appeared
in a report of a federal hear-
ing held Jan. 21 and 22, 1970, at
Gulf Breeze, Fla. We objected
to these figures at the time
principally because they did not
take into account the condition
of the waters in the river prior
to use by our plant.

In effect, the pollution statis-

‘ tics quoted from this report were

not limited to the portions actu-
ally contributed by our plant.

It is surprising to us that a
plant that has done so much and

spent so many millions of dol-
lars to abate pollution since its
completion 17 years ago has been
the target of so much ill-consid-
ered. uninformed. and unfair
criticism.

The letter mentions Astro-Turf.
This product does not contribute
to environmental problems be-
cause scientists say the supply of
oxygen is.so vast as to b virtu-
ally inexhaustible. The fact is
that this kind of artificial turf
eliminates the need for lawy and
garden chemicals.

In summary, we feel the peo-
ple involved in writing the letter.
although possibly well-meaning,
were misguided.

‘You Say You Want A Revolution’..

Editor.

I was sitting in the Hot
Shoppe last night discussing rev-
olution with three of my friends.
We decided that in our gener-
ation, there will be no Revolu-
tion.

The workers are paid too well
and the kids (us) don‘t have it
together enough to cause any
kind of meaningful revolution
(except 33 1/3 per minute).

I don’t want to bring you
down, but if you believe that
the Washington Moratorium is an
indication of how serious the
Revolution is, think seriously
about the importance of kite-
flying, dope-smoking, group-
singing, and picnicing in a po-
litical Revolution.

We view the November Mora-
torium as a real neat funfest
that attracted a helluva lot. of
kids and “fun was had by all.”

We also decided that the kids
(us) don‘t have it together enough
to have any kind of campaign
last long enough to have any ef-

feet. There is only one way. we
feel, to cause any effect. And
it‘s not very effective on a grand
scale but it may pay off in the
future.

We've got to deal with the
problems on a personal level.
Each one of us has tmgo and
talk to The People.

Tell them where your head is‘

at and what these issues mean to
you. Tell them in_ their own
language and don't use rhetoric
slogans made famous by and mis-
used by the media. 3

My personal thing is to write
letters: to politicians, news-

papers, and corporations. If the 

president or editor never sees
the letter but it sways an un-
derlying, it’s worth it. Here’s a
copy of a letter I send to pol-
luting corporations, for example:

“I am a college student in
Pittsburgh. Idig life.

“I don‘t know much about the
physical and biological aspects
of pollution. and I know even
less about the economic aspects

0 $3.50 Entry Fee

  

  
   

(my major is mathematics and
philosophy). but I do know
enough to believe that if the pre-
sent rate of air, water. and earth.
pollution continues. disaster is
a certainty. And this disaster will
include everyone in the world.
It's that simple.

".1 am writing an appeal to you.
Rather than saying ‘stop pollut-
ing by 6 p.m. tomorrow or I‘ll
blow up your building.‘ I will
make an appeal to you (an ap-
peal is harder to ignore than an
ultimatum.)

“See what you can do and if in
any way possible, do what you
can to stop polluting the en-
vironment. Your life may not be
in danger, but your childrens’
lives are. Life is better than
money.” -

If you've read this far. thanks
and consider what you‘ve read.
Also, consider carefully the rest
of the letter: ~

Evaluation Makes
No Consensus

themselves but criticized differ-
ent aspects of the course.

Editor.

I am grateful to Evan Pattak
for pointing out in his review of
the Course Evaluation book (Pitt
News. March 19) the strange
discrepancy between the numeri-
cal evaluation given English
132 and the extremely negative
comments accovpanying it.

As the teacher of English 132,
I to, of course, had noted this
but had feared that. gven the
nature of the publication, no one
else would look beyond those
eye-catching comments.

If one searches out the reason
for the discrepancy, one finds a‘
considerable more serious fault
in the book than incoherence.
The introduction to the evalua-
tion guide makes this statement;
"Following the statistics is a con-
sensus of the comments written
by students, when a significant
number of comments was re-
ceived.“

For English 132, 9 of the 19
evaluations included comments.
Five students limited their re-
marks to the work load, which
they felt was heavy for a 3-cre-
dit course.

A sixth student wrote: “Al-
though the course required a

great deal of work, I feel it is‘

the best literature course I have
taken at Pitt.“

Three cards contained strong-
ly-worded negative comments. It
seems to me that by the criteria
of the guide itself. the only point
of student consensus concerned
the amount of work required.

Furthermore, if we set aside
for a moment that the views of
three out of 19 students do not
constitute a consensus. these three
students did not agree among

Itregret that three students

those preparing a guide such as
this should realize that not all
the reasons are the responsibilily
of the instructor, and they should
not let the tone of these few‘neg-
ative comments totally obscure

the content of the others, as well j ‘
as the results of the carefully

worked-out ratingsystem. There
should be no need to point out
the heavy responsibility of
data—collectors and interpretors.

I think that the student course
evaluation is a good idea and

that the mechanics of this one—‘ 7
the categories set up and the -

statistical breakdown,

for in-
stance—are excellent.

The kind of feed back it is

designed to give is extremely’

valuable as one works at im- ‘

proving a course for the next
time round. :

When the information is used
by an editor in such a careless,
irresponsible, and daging way,
however, it does a painful dis-
service, not only to the instructor,
but also to serious students who
rely on the guide.

spirituals, original ballads, and
cool jazz are just some of the in-
gredients «used by Voices, Inc., to
make The Believers the produc-
tion that it is. -

A teeming Newark ghetto pro-

duced the Voices, a black-owned
and operated corporation. It was
chartered to package, produce,
and peform Negro cultural works
in the United States.

Negro spirituals were original-
ly emphasized by the group, but
its growing choral has given rise

Thomas A. Edison citation, and”

  
  

   
   
    
  

to a word song format called a .1
“musical narrative. “

The concept has prompted na-
tional organizations to use Voices, F

Inc., for the creation of special-- 

productions. Educational televi-'
sion has used the group to produce
“In Black America,” “Harlem
Shadows," "Black Pride,“ “This
Is Our Day“ and “Slavery,” win- ‘
ner of the Peabody Award, a-

runner—up for the Japan prize in"
competition with films from 14
nations.

about situations which happen to
friends and lovers all the time.
Yet, you never feel as though you
are hearing the same old thing
that somebody else wrote all over
again.

The album opens with a story
about a girl trying to find her own
personality in a society which she
says she really ought to be getting
married. As strong as she maybe.
she too. gives in because "That's
the Way I've Always Heart It
Should Be." This one verse sums
up her philosophy:

You say that we can keep our love alive
Babe, all I know is what I see-

The couples cling and claw

And drown in Iove's debris

You say we'll soar like two birds through

the clouds

But soon you'll cage me on your shelf

I'll never learn to be just me first

By myself.

“Reunion.“ another of her com-
positions. is one of those songs
which comes up from behind by
surprise and makes you a bit mel-
ancholy with:

But no one even comments—
Except to say

‘Goodbye.’
And I don't know if I'll see you again.

It is followed up by a sparky lit-
tle number called “Rolling Down
the Hills." I could imagine some-
one doing a soft-shoe to this one.

Her songs generally incorporate
country twangs, folk, blues and

other genres with her own dis-
tinctive manner, forming a pure
lyrical package.

Carly Simon is worth a chance.
and I predict even greater things

. by her for the future. And if she

is given no further publicity. it
wouldn‘t really matter to me. I
would buy her albums without
hesitation, even if the record com-
panies are out pushing someone
else.

HELP
First it starts in one speaker.
soon the other joins in to bring you
a great new group with Decca al-
bum by the same name. Help.

Mike Gruber. former manager
of the Stones; Moby Grape. and
Taj Mahal found them and soon
they were recording their first al-
bum. a very promising start.

The album not only sounds great
but if you bother to listen to the
lyrics, you won’t be disappointed
either.

For example, the second side
begins with "Keep in Touch, " a
hard-hitting song musically and
lyrically. It offers:

Try to keep in touch when you say you will
—don’t pretend to feel things you know ain't
real
Take a look at the fools—
They've lost respect for humanity

There are so many to see
They've broken all the rules.

My favorite song on the album
is only a minute and a ha1f.called
"I Tried Too Hard.“ It is very soft
rock. and has great vocals and
mixing. I couldn't forget it even
through the next song. I guess my
mood and its touching lyrics help-
ed:

I'm not the kind of man to try and put you
down

But pretty soon you’re gonna find that I ain't
around

I hope that things will change before we ever
reach that day

I pray that we will love again before I go
away.

There are many fine songs on
this release. stemming the ones
mentioned to "Run Away“ and
“Open Up the Door" to "Commit
Yourself."

«Do yourself a favor and try
this on with a pair of headphones
and nice comfortable couch.

ALEX TAYLOR
The Taylor family sure isn't go-
ing to quit. are they! Alex. brother
of Livingston. Kate. and James.
is out on his own too. However.

 

he doesn‘t quite come off as well
as the rest.

His music is just the sameas
his brothers. and his voice is a
twangy. country. mixture of the
two.

One of the better songs on the
disc, “Night Owl” was written by
James and James’ acoustic gui-
tar accompanies. It makes you
wonder who is really doing the
song. ‘

He also does "It‘s All Over
Now" and the Stones haven‘t got a
thing to worry about.

There isn‘t much to say about
this release. It’s just another Tay-
lor. The album will be a disap-
pointment to Livingston and
James fans. but if you like to
listen to more of the same thing.
without regards to individuality.
then I guess this album is yours.

Greeks‘ ‘Greatest Show’ Strikes Tent

by SUE RUFFNER

Campus Greeks displayed their
singing and dancing talents last
week during the Inter-Fraternity
Pan Hellenic sponsored Greek
Week. This year‘s theme. “The
Greatest Show on Earth.“ was
portrayed as circus life in the
chariot race and banner events.

While Traditional Chait Reigns

The first musical event was
the Talent Contest. in which each
of the 11 sororities participating
in Greek Week entered a candi-
date. The judging was done on
the basis of talent and poise.

The winner. sponsored by Al-
pha Epsilon Phi and Pi Lambda
Phi. was Patty Brown who sang
“I Don‘t Know How to Love
Him“ from the album Jesus
Christ, Superstar. Also placing
in the competition were Char-
lene Casciotti and Mary Ann
Gunselman.

The second event, Greek Sing,
was held Wednesday at Car-
negie Music Hall to a near capa-
city crowd. At that time “The
Greatest Songs on Earth”—those
songs which produced a Gold
Record, were performed by mem-
bers of each participating soror-

ity and fraternity. The songs
ranged from the “Bradesburg
Concerto” to “Rubble Duckie.”

The winners of the competition
for sororities were Delta Phi Ep-
silon. Delta Zeta. and Alpha Ep-
silon Phi. respectively. The fra-
ternity winners wej Delta Phi.
Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) and Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon.

“Thursdays activities featured
a buffet style dinner with a live
band in the Student Union Ball-
room. Proceeds from the tickets
wentto Children‘s Hospital.

also conducted a two-week long
charity drive for Children’s
Hospital and a Blood Drive
sponsored by the Inter-Pan Don-

At the conclusion of Greek
Week. Delta Phi Epsilon and

Sports Editor

The gridders concluded their
‘third week of spring drills with
a full scrimmage on Saturday
afternoon.

With the sun out and the tem-
perature in the mid-40‘s Coach
Carl DePasqua got a chance to

I watch most of his squad in ac-
tion. Three of the four quarter-
backs were on hand, each of
them getting a good deal of ex-
. y posure.

Sophomore Rod Huth, one of
the two signal-callers from last
year’s freshmen squad, didn‘t
dress for the scrimmage. He fell
on his knee during practice last
 week and DePasqua isn't cer-
tain when he’ll be back with
the squad.

, Injuries played a smaller part
in Saturday's drills then they
have in previous weeks. No seri-
ous mishaps occurred in the scrim-
mage and according to DePas-
qua, “we were getting some of‘
the injured back for the prac-
tice. That’s always helpful."

With John Hogan, Bob Med-
wid and Dave Havern rotating
at the pilot_position DePasqua
got a good look at where his
offensive strength will lie next
year.

Both Hogan and Medwid en-
gineered sustained touchdown
drives, with Havern also mov-
ing the ball well during his
time at the helm. All three
quarterbacks put the ball into
the air more than they have in
previous weeks.

"The weather improved the
passing game," commented De-
Pasqua. “The receivers caught
the ball fairly well out there.
We still don't have any good,
precise timing down. We’re
still pretty ragged."

Medwid put on a running show
durcg the touchdown drive he
engineered. With a dash of 25
yards following a 20 yard com-
pletion to split end Doug Gin-
den, the squad penetrated to the
12 yard line. After the defense
held for three downs, Medwid
completed a pass_for a first
down to the 2 yard line. Two
plays later Medwid snuck in
for the score.

Hogan came in after Dave
Havern had trouble moving the
team. Hogan started a drive at
his own 40 yard line and took
the squad down to the defenses
40 before throwing a 40 yard
TD strike to John Chatman.

first round pin over Bill Hill
of East Carolina in the 177
pound class. Tritch then pro-
ceeded to lose in the second
round, 9-3, to his Mich. State
foe.

Neither Tritch nor Bob Kuhn
(167) were seeded. Kuhn drop-
ped an 8-6 heart—breaker to Idaho
State’s John Caccia in the first
round. Caccia, who was fifth at
167 pounds in the 1970 Nationals,
failed to place over the week-
end at Auburn.

Andy Matter, Penn State’s and
the EIWA’s only winner, tore
through his opposition all the
way to the finals. There, Lehigh’s
Steve Shields, who had decision-

ed Matter, 5-2, only two weeks

previously in the District 2 tour-
nament, forced the Nittany Lion
into overtime before bowing on
a referree’s decision.

Although he was disappointed
that Tritch and Kuhn did not
place. Coach Dave Adams was
impressed by the outstanding
performances turned in by many
wrestlers at Auburn.

"T-his tournament was one of
the best Nationals I have ever
seen, as far as the caliber of
wrestling goes." remarked
Adams. "It was hard to believe
that so many talented guys
could be at each weight. “

Several mat critics have sug-
gested that college wrestling in
the East does not measure up to
the competition in the Big Eight

self from three defenders took
the ball in full stride just as
he crossed the goal line.

Another offensive standout dur-
ing Saturdays action was sopho-
more Bill Englert. Englert took
a hand-off from Dave Havern and
scampered 35 yards up the cen-
ter of the turf before being stop-
ped on the enemy's 15 yard
line. He also took a 14 yard
touchdown pass from Hogan dur-
ing the last few minutes of
the scrimmage.

I All three quarterbacks mixed
their attacks up well, combin-
ing the aerial game with a lot of
running plays. DePasqua went
with nearly the same type of-
fense regardless of who was
at the helm.

“We go with pretty much the
same offense with all of the
quarterbacks,” he said. “There
are small variations and a lot
depends on how much protec-
tion they get from the backs.
But the important thing is just
to getthem in there and give
them the exposure.”

DePasqua was also pleased

The ground game accounted
for much of the success of the
touchdown drives. 6-3 sophomore
Stan Ostrowski received a lot of
playing time in addition to. vet-
erans Lou Julian and John Moss.

“People were running good,”
said DePasqua after the action.

With five more practices left
DePasqua and the Panthers set
their eights on the highlight and
conclusion of spring practice,
next Saturday’s Blue-Gold Game.

“I blew thedive out the window?’ remarked
Dave Wessel on his disappointing showing at the
Natvnal Swimming and Diving Championship
at Ames Iowa last weekend.

The dive Wesselreferred to was a double)

twisting one and a half somersault off the one-
meter board.

This was his last dive of the five dive list for
the preliminary round of the one meter competi-
tion on Thursday.

“I was leaning on my hurdle and throwing the
dive before I left the board,” he continued. “I
was well in the range of making the finals if I
could score on the dive as I usually do in dual
meets. But I rushed it in my mind and took it
way outwhich killed it.”

Because of this poor dive he didn’t make the
cut for the finals held the following day.

“I was really psyched out," he said. “In warm-
up Friday for the three-meter competition I hit
the board. I didn’t hit hard, I just took a back
dive straight up and straight down on the board. "

“I was really pissed off at myself_.”

He didn't make the finals in the three-meter
competition. -

“The list of dives I had didn‘t have a high
enough degree of difficulty to score enough points
to make the finals," Dave remarked. “I really
didn’t want to dive.“

But Dave bettered his performance of last year
at the National championship. He finished 48th in
a field of 68 last year on the one ~meter board.
This year he finished 39th out of 69.

According to Dave, everyone from the Eastern
championships ‘bombed out.’

John Hufstedder from Princeton. the Eastern
champion finished somewhere in the thirties. The
only eastern diver to do well was Ken Light from
Cornell. He finished fifth in the Eastern champion-
ship but came on strong to place tenth at Nation-
als.

The eventual winner of both the one meter and
three meter competition was Ohio State’s Mike
Finneran.

Pensively speaking about the past. Dave indicat-
ed that he is just a good dual meet diver.

Wessel Ends Career
  iWith Dismal Showing

FIRST YEAR dent student -Dave Wessel ended his
diving career last weekend with a less than aver-
age performance at the NCAA Nationals.

“I’ve got a lot to learn about diving in the bv
meets. There was anlhoucand a half wait be-
tween my dives. They had no facilities for warm-
ing up or for keeping loose." 9

-“When my turn to dive arrived I was cold.
It is tough to dive under pressure when you
are cold.” '

“I knew I wasn‘t as sharp as last year be-
cause I haven't done as much  this year.“

Indiana University won the National Collegi-
ate Athletic Association meet in which Wessel
competed. Former Olympian and world record
holder Gary Hall of Indiana won three events to
pacelthe Hoosiers.

Hall also broke three American records on
his way to victory.

U.SC and UCLA‘ finished in second and third
more than 90 points behind the champ. _ yr

“I‘m more exicted about the
National Gymnastic champion-
ship this year than last year," re-
marked Lowell Meek. Pitt's
Eastern gymnastic champion.

"I was hurt last year with a
sprained ankle on which I almost
couldn’t walk. I was naturally
excited about finishing 16th.“

This year Meek isn't hurt or in-
jured and in his words, "I should
score.“ '

The 5’9” 135 lb. gymnast was
listed in Modern Gymnasts as one
of the performers likely to re-
peat his performance at Michigan
April 1-3. ,

Meek has changed his rbutine
for the National championship. In
his third line he has added a back
handspring off his knees. This
move has been added to gain
points on originality. Meek said
that his layout split back som-
ersault “wasn‘t quite enough."

Meek has a good chance to
score this year. Tom Poulx, the
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation champion (NCAA), won
the title last year with a compos-

ite score of 18.575. Meek won the
Eastern title with a score of
18.425.

“That score doesn’t indicate
that I will be right up there in the
tox six,” interjected Meek. “All
but Poulx in the top six will be re-
turning for the championship.
And there are also those super
freshman who pop up from no-
where.

“But I hope to make the finals.
which includes the top six scorers
after the first two days of com-
petition.

“And quite possibly All-Ameri-
can status,“ he continued hope-
fully.

But the competition is so tight
and keen that Meek said, “one
mistake and you’re out of it.”

“The judges are the best in the
country and they don't miss a
thing," the senior gymnast re-
marked. “If there is one sign of
instability or the lack of balance
they deduct one-tenth of a point."

Golfers Unprepared
For Opening Match
Against C-MU Squad

With five lettermen returning from last years squad; the golf
team swings into action this Thursday afternoon against Carnegie-Mel-
lon University in the first match of the spring season despite limited

practice.

Originally. the linksmen were scheduled to face the West Virginia
club tomorrow afternoon in Morgantown. Coach Rex Peery has ar-
ranged with the Mountaineers to delay the match until later on this

month.

Peery did this because the team
has been unable to practice due to
weather conditions. He hopes to
agree with Bucknell on a change
in schedule for the same reason.

“We can’t move the Carnegie
match even though we thought it
would be the easiest one to
change,” Peery said.

Presently, Peery is uncertain
of the starting lineup for the first
match. He expects that the five
lettermen, John Kubala. Mike
Jones, Tim Crist, Ray George.
and Rick Plonka will see action.

The other starting spots will be
filled by two newcomers. Battling
for the positions are Dave Ress—

ler, Bob Brouman, and Ed Balano. T

Perry hopes that he’ll get a
chance to get a look at the players
on the course before Thursday’s
