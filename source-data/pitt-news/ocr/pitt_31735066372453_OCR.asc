To the players of Pitt and

aged not only onithe football
field. but in the heart. In both
places, it’s not uncommon to find
hate.

For the sake of semantics. the

coaches who cultivate it call it
“intensity.“' perhaps because
mommas don’t let their babies
grow up to be vengeful. and foot-
ball rivals—shouldn’t either. So its
tagged intensity: one ofthe pow-
ers that be in footba|l.along with
some Iephyr called momentum.

perhaps faster opponent.

‘ By LAURIE MocLEOD

Pitt organizations have been
working together on projects to
show student enthusiasm for
Saturday's l’itt—l’enn State
game.

“We are trying to coordinate

Penn State game." said Student
Government President Bill
Abraham.

SGB has been working with
several other organi7ations to
come up with various pro_jects to
fire up the fans for this rivalry
ballgame. A

Other groups involved
include: the Pitt Golden Pan-
thers. Sports lnformation.
Athletics Department. Commu-
ter Affairs. various alumni asso-
ciations. and the administration.

One goal of these spirit-
oriented projects is to distribute
a large number oi‘ shakers to the
Pitt students free of charge.

The initial number ol‘ shakers
to be given was I().()()(). but an
additional l(l.()()() has been com-
mitted b)’ the administration.

to Abraham.

Budweiser has donated 2b,()()()

for the event.

The estimated cost for the pro-

jects is S I ().0()(). with “the shakers

being the biggest expense."
Abraham said.

Student government has allo-
cated $2,7()() for the project. The
rest will be covered by various
involved groups.

Abraham said projects like
these “would reflect the positive
image of the university.”

Because the game will be
nationally televised. the crowds
cheering in the stands would
show our enthusiasm and boost
our athletics. he said.

It would also “encourage
recruitment and attract alumni
contributions." he said.

Abraham added that people
consider Pitt strictly urban with
no “sense of community." He
believes that Saturday‘s game
will be a way to prove those crit-
ics wrong.

He also said he thought stu-
dents haxe become skeptical
about the acti\ ities in the school.
and doing projects to encourage
enthusiasm will proxe their
support. ‘

PLO Against Terrorism,Sympathizer Says 1.

By MARGARET ATTWOOD

The Palestinian Liberatior
Organization (PLO) is against ter-
rorism. according to (ihassan K.

. Bishara. correspondent to A/—Fa_/'i'

Neirspaper of Jerusalem.‘ who spoke
last night at a lecture in I~‘orbes
Quadrangle. which was sponsored
by the Organi/ation of Arab
Students.

While the speech was in progress a
crowd of Jewish students sang.
chanted and distribtited literature
outside the quad protesting the right

ofa P.I..('). sympatlti/er to speak on
campus.

Bishara. who claims he is not a
P.I..O. member but is one who
understands the Palestinian posi-
tion. claims that the P.I..O. is a
inany-factioned organiiation (radi-
cal. moderate. conservative) whose
goal is not the destruction of the
Israeli people. He said the P.l..O.
wants the liberation of Palestine and
the destruction of a state apparatus
whose very nature. according to
Bishara. gives democracy to the
Jews while making the Palestinians
second—class citizens.

The audience groaned when
Bishara said. “The goal of the
P.l..(). is the liberationofPalestine.
which doesn‘t mean the destruction
of Israel. If that happens. it‘s too
bad.“

Bishara continued. “The P.I..O.
intention is not to kill people.“ He
claims that on specific instances
Israeli bullets have killed their own
children and given the blatne to the
P.l..().

When asked about the iinplica—
tions of continued fighting in the
Middle Fast, Bishara said. “The

.lJ.S. seems to only want to_deal with

symptoms. not with the real issues.
The worst is still to come. With
(Menachem) Begin in power. expect
a lot worse. There is a potential for
global conflict. world conflict.
super—power conflict."

Bishara reminded his listeners.
“Begin was one of the biggest terror-
ists going towards the British during
the l94()s. This is an irony. but Begin
knows who and whatihc is.

“The greater irony is in the posi-
tion ofthe ll .8. gotcrninent towards
the l’.I..O. The U.S. is supposed to
be great defenders of democracy.
and yet it is willing to play this game
of calling the P.I..O. terrorists when
really the organization is trying to
use any method they can to freetheir
country.

“The Western sense ofterrorism is
a foreign concept to Arabs. They are
not familiar with this term.“

Bishara claimed that the I’.l..().
recognives Israel‘s right to exist. but
that this has no effect on Israeli
policy.

“Israel simply doesn‘t want to part
with sections of the country. They
want an historic Israel." he said.

“The radical elements of the
P.l..O. are the most humanitarian."
according to Bishara. “They want to
see a secular democracy in Israel;
like in this country where the
government is not .lewis‘h. Christian
nor Moslein.

“The P_l..().

wants to create

something that is new in the Arab
world. The idea of a secular demo-
cracy was turned down by the Israe-
lis who want a Jewish state.“
According to Bishara. “Support
for the P.l..0. is unquestionable in

‘ the West Bank. The Palestinians see

the P.l..(). as their soul
representative."
When questioned about the

P.I..(). practice of assassinating
those who do not support the organ-
i/ation. Bishara said. “All countries
have ways to treat those who are
perceived to be a threat to their
national interest."

By CHRISTINE WILTANGER

Cross the concrete and dart
through the shiny glass doors of
the University‘s Presbyterian
Hospital. We‘re going to visit the
studio used by the Pitt Video
Club.

We're being led by Chris Kry-
sinski. founder and president of
the club. who looks more like a
distinguished English pirofessor
in his tweed _jacket and heard
than an undergraduate in Eng-

 lish l.it. He speaks like a profes-

sor too low. mild and well
controlled.

Onto an escalator and down
the glossy hall that hums with the
starched swish of nurses’ skirts
and squishy soled shoes against
the tile.

“Graham Chapman should
like this. He's a doctor. you
know." Krysinski says.

He is talking about Graham
Chapman of The I.i'/2) of Brian.
and Manly Pyllrun and the Holy
Grail. who spoke at Pitt Thurs-
day night. And the Pitt Video

If professors Chris and Mary Raw-

son. will produce and tape an
interview with Chapman. to be
aired around Christmas time on
Warner Cable TV.

"We'll be doing two half-hour
interviews with him." says Kry-
sinski. He pushes open a door
into the blue-green bowels of
Scaife Hall. Rows ofsteel-frame
carts filled with hospital blues
line the left -side of the hall.

He pushes an elevator button.
“He‘ll be showing some film clips
from Monty Python that haven‘!
been shown in the US. before."
he says.

The elevator doors slide shut
and we ride in silence to the fifth
floor. Then it’s out and through a
male of hallways again. past
rooms filled with test tubes and

‘large square stainless steel
cabinets that beep red lights on
and off. Refyigcrators padlocked
shut line the way. .

There it is. Stuck to a door

man and a woman sit at the
control board. running tape and
stopping it. running it some more
and stopping it again.

I They look up when we enter.

“I'll be through in about five

minutes. Krysinski.“ the man
says.

So we gointothe studioand sit
down. and take off our coats.
The photographer starts with ,
shots - of Krysinski by the
camera. by the blackboard. in
front of the long window that
separates the control room with
its flashing equipment from the
studio.

Posing as he moves about the
room. Krysinski talks about the
Pitt Video Club. It began last
winter when he and some friends
got together with some equip-
ment he owned.

“Basically. I bought my video
camera and recorded with it and
got bunches ofpcople together to
work with it. That's how the club
fo rmed . "

“Right now we have about
twcnty—five to thirty members.
That‘s a good size. Sometimes
there‘s not enough work for eve-
ryone to do. This production
(Graham Chapman) will take
about ten people to get it done.“

Currently. the Pitt Video Club
is trying to get recognition from
the Student Media Board.

“\\'e‘rc already recognized by
Student Activities. and get our

funding from from the Student

Government. but we'd like to be
on the student publications.
There's only four groups there
instead of four hundred. The
money would be the same. but
it‘d make our budgeting easier.
and let us have grad students as
members.“

 l=ocus On Pitt Video Club  

looking at all the equipment.
the camet'as spread out among
desks. and a blackboard. the
photographer asks. “What do
you guys film?"

"We just finished a film on
Homecoming. And we filmed the
Jan Seminar. We're hoping to
maybe do talk shows with two
professors’. or Ted Windt in an
election year.“ _

Krysinski‘s mind is full of
ideas. lhe photographer. fin-
ished shooting. wanders around
the studio.

“Allegheny ()bservatory just
became the International Center
for Extra Terrestrial l.ife. We‘d
like to do something with that."

Krysinski smiles nervously.
and looks around.

“What do you have to do to

join?“ the photographer asks. He

stands over by the glass wall. gal-
ing at the ceiling to floor elec-
tronics equipment inside.

“Nothing much. Just call me.
or come to the meetings. They‘re
Tuesdays. at b:()(). AV confer-
ence room 020."

The photographer nods.

It gets quiet and we sit in the
studio for awhile watching the
people on the other side of the
glass wall.

“That‘s John Rebhun. our
technical adviser." Krysinski
sa-ys. "He works for UCIR (Uni-
versity Center for Instructional
Research). It's their studio and
equipment. They just let us use
it."

“Just about everything we
have is here. or we can rent it
from AV in the library. We can
use anything here with John's
approval."

We sit and watch Rebhun and
his colleague running their tapes.

Or Why Pitt Fans OutdoPSU

By KEVIN MCKEOWN

They were all there.

The Pitt Panther. Jackie Shcrrill.
Pitt football players and. yes. even
Kl)KA-’|‘V‘s Patti Burns.

There were T-shirts and hats and
sayings: “Beast of the East“ and ‘fl
Hate State.“

If Monday night‘s pep rally for the
annual Pitt—Pcnn State game could
be compared to anything. or any
school. you might end up saying it
seemed like something that goes on
all the timc...a1 Penn State. L

' We get the impression that Penn
State fans are more supportive.
more vocal. more collegiate. We see
their blue-and~whitc shakers on
national TV;' we gasp at their shccr
numbers. We tend to compare them
to oui'scl\'cs. and we come up on the
short end.

But only because we forget.

We forget that Pitt and Penn
State. . both in terms of student

I bodies and simple geography. are

vastly different schools.

Consider State College- the
Happy Valley campus. on a Satur-
day. Thcrs is nowhere to go. nothing
to do. The college oversliadows the
town. making it tiiercly an extension
of the campus. For lack of anything
better to do (or anything at all to do.
for that matter) the Penn State fan

Ninety-one percent of last year"s
60.368 Penn State students were
Pennsylvania residents. Pittsburgh
and surrounding Allegheny County
accounted for 4.754 of them.

“Both my parents went to Pitt
and. besides. I wanted to get away
from the city." says a Penn State
jtfnior from Churchill. explaining
why she decided on Penn State
rather than Pitt. “I love the atmos-
phere here. It's a lot more casual and
l have more freedom and less worry-
ing here than l would at Pitt.“

when I graduated.” says a female

arisen. however. from both faculty
and student viewpoints.
. The most seriousfaculty objec-
tions concern the potential of a
teaching overload and the fear of a
reduction in research. while student
objections stem from the foreseen
difficulties in changing ina_jors under
a longer semester calendar.

l.ike Pitt. Penn State has the ~' du-
bious distinction of being one ofthe
most expensive public schools in the
nation.

Of the lo5 schools surveyed in ‘a
report released "by the National
Association of State Universities

ary. Pitt ranked third with its SL790
per year in-state tuition: Penn State
ranked fifth with its $1.041 in-state
tuition per year.

Over |3.()()() students live in more
than 50 dorms spread throughout
the main campus.

The most popular dorms among
upperclassmen and athletes are
West Halls. which consist of eight
interconnected dorms. Every
March. students camp out for one or

_even two days. bearing the cold.

rain. and sometimes snow. to land a
dorm contract which is awarded on
a first-come. first-serve basis.

“Penn State is not a suitcase col-
lcge where everyone packs up and
heads home for the weekend."
explains one West Hall resident.
“The area you choose to live in is
important because you spend a lot of
time there." '

Sports a re very prominent at
Penn State. The university has more
varsity teams than any other NCAA
Division l school has. In football.
Penn State has not had a losing sea-
son since I938 an NCAA record.
I)uring the last 25 years the Lions

This Saturday. the Penn State
l.ions will defeat their arch_—
rivals. the Pitt Panthers.

That was the general consen-

» sus among Penn State students

surveyed in State College a week
before the Lions were soundly
defeated by Alabama in frontofa
record crowd of 85.133 in Beaver
Stadium.

“We’ll definitely beat Pitt.“
said one Penn State student con-
fidently. “I think were a lot bet-
tcr prepared considering our
schedule includes games with
teams like Alabama and Notre
Dame.“

“It will be good match-up. but
when it‘s over. the Lions will be
the winners." added another stu-
dent and avid l.ion fan.

Not allithc students surveyed
were certain that there would be

such a sound victory and a lot of

“ifs“ were heard.

“lf Curt Warner is healthy. we
should win.“ explained a Penn
State student. referring to the
Lions‘ numero uno running
back. i

 

“I think Penn State will take it
if Brian Franco doesn‘t forget his
_foot at home." said another stu-
dent. adding that the l_ion place
kicker‘s misses were responsible
for the Miami loss.

Another thing heard over and
over again during the survey was
the name of Joe Paterno. To
many students zit State College.
Paterno is more than the football
coach and the llniversit_v‘s
athletic director.

. “Joe Paterno's done a lot for
Penn State in general. notjust in
sports.’T said one student. “He
could run for governor and
everyone would vote for him."

“Joe Paterno ‘is God here.“
added another student. summing
up the importance of football at
Penn State and possibly shed-
ding light on why students are
willing to pay $25 for footlwall
season tickets.

 

“Paterno will really motivate

the team." added another stu-
dent. "They‘ll be hungry for a
victory."

Motivating the Lions for this
week-end's game should be no
problem for Paterno. First. the
Panthers are the Lions‘ arch-
rival and second. they're the
nation's top-ranked team. Third.
Pitt's recent decision to join the
Big East Conference in basket—’
ball should upset Paterno some-
what. since the decision virtually

eliminates the possibility of his

proposed all-sports East Confer-
ence becoming a reality.

One student. fairly sure of a
Penn State victory. was quick to
make a team comparisions on an
academic level.

“Pitt has the reputation of
having big. dumb jocks on their
team who are there just to play
football.“ he says. “Penn State
players. on the other hand. have
to attend classes and spend time
in~the library during the week." .

Another student. although a
loyal Blue and White fan. gave
her prediction quickly and
quietly.

“Pitt is going to win."shc said
in a hushed voice alter looking
over her shoulder. 5,,

major. “You can dress and choose
your friends as _vo.u please without
having to worry about fitting in."

“Although fraternities and sorori-
ties are very popular here. Penn
State is big enough that you don‘t
have to belong (to one) in order to
have a social life."

4L

He'siright on bothcounts. Stu-
dents can choose tojoin any ofsome
300 student organizations. and the
Greek system is very popular at
Penn State.

Sororities and fraternities are on
the rise at Penn State. The I9 sorori-
ti'es'and~-50 fraternities had a record
number of students try out. or
"rush" this fall. This resurgence of
interest in the Greek system is not
unique to Penn State; it'_is common
these days at many campuses across
the country.

What is unique about Penn
State's Greek system. however. is
that about a dozen ofthe university's
fraternities are housed in what some
have called the nation's most beauti-
ful and well-cared-for fraternity
houses. A

A guided tour of one of these fra-
ternities. Beta Theta Pi. reveals not
only that the interior is as beautiful
as the outside but that brotherhood
is taken seriously in Happy Valley.

Beta Theta Pi is housed in a three-
story English tuder niansion that is
almost a block long and is home to
50 brothers. ' r
T “We are one of the top fraternities
on campus." explains John. a Beta
Theta Pi brother from Philadelphia.
“All of the pledges are scrutini/edi
very carefully before they become
brothers. We are very close here."

The house's features include a liv-
ing room with a 24-foot vaulted ceil-
ing. leaded glass doors that open
into a large. formal dining room. a
second-floor library that overlooks
the living room. and two oak-
pancled. party rooms in the
basement complete with fire-
places. j r ‘

John explains that former broth-
ers. such as his dad. contribute
money to provide for the‘ upkeep of_
the -house. ln addition. Beta Theta’
Phi's everyday cleaning and cook-
ing. unlike most fraternities. is done
by the brothers themselves. T

“We don't believe in the idea of
little sisters." he says. “We manage
fine without them."

For those not into the traditional
Greek scene. barhopping and pri-

vate parties offer attractive alterna— —

lives.

But no matter what they do or
where they live. most Penn State stu-
dents«adhere to certain social tradi-
tions that include. among other
things. participating in homecoming
weekend and tailgate parties before.
during and after home football
games. Another social tradition is
climbing Mt. Nittany the most
prominent Appalachian mountain
towering above the valley.

“The view from Mt. Nittany is
spectacular." says a student who's
climbed it several times. “If you go
to Penn State and don't climb it.you
shouldn't be allowed to graduate.“

A couple is slowly walking

a manicured lot a full block long.

This timeless scene set in Penn
State could have easily taken
place three weeks ago or 20 years
ago. Either way. the traditional.
yetcarefree. atmosphere remains
the same. i

Because of this. Penn State
students have a difficult time
after graduation because they are
no longer in surroundings where
almost everything is picture
perfect.

Although they “are isolated
geographically by the Appalach-

A ians and doinot experience the

everyday-urban occurrences that
a Pitt student might (such as
heavy traffic. pollution and peo-

dents say they do not feel they're

“We have everything we need
right on campus. so we don't
need to be near a city." says one

_ Penn State student. “lfwe want

to see a concert or a play. we just
bring it to Penn State. Werhave
the facilities.“ -

On one recent Friday evening.
Penn State students could have
chosen to attend the movie
“Apm'a/_t'p.\'e Now," the play
" The Glass‘ Menagerie. "or a per-
formance by the Pilobolus
Dance Company.

"Penn State is a lot different
from"many campuses. You have
everything right there and you're
so content. you'don‘t feel like
ever leaving." explains a Pitt stu-
dent who has spent a lot of time
in State College. “It must be a

' little scary for them (Penn State

students) when they have to leave
there for good and face the ‘real
world.‘ "

Leaving Penn‘ State after gra-
duation is difficult. a point to
which two recent graduates
attest.

“I'm still enjoying this place;
it's hard to get sick of it." says a
May l9Xl history graduate. “I
didn't have anything linediup.
and because I still have a lot of
friends here. l decided to take a

His friend. a I980 agricultural
science graduate now working in
the northwestern part of the

' state. visits Penn State oniweek-
ends and admits that leaving
Penn State was a rude
awakening.

“I rememberfriends who grad-
uated ahead of me saying ‘stay
here as long as you can and
enjoy.’ “ he explains. “it didn't
take long after I left to figure out
why."

In general. Penn State stu-
dents feel secure in their sur-
roundings: however. they are
aware of the crime that occurs on’
campus. According to some stu-
dents. this summer's abduction
and rape ofa student on a part of
campus once considered safe at
any hour has caused a number of

- students to stop and think.

Unlike Pitt. there are no
policemen standing on corners
with dogs and desk attendants in
dorms checking lDs. The
absence of strict security rules in
the dormitories verifies how safe
Penn State students feel.

“I feel very safe here."says one
female student. “Each dorm
floor votes on whether or not to
have visitation rules. but most
floors don't want them. We don't
feel a need for them.“

Pitt, Penn St. RevUforTHE Game

By AMINLGHOSSEIN

On Friday evening. Pitt players
will be in their hotel roolns. tryingto

 r ‘ady for the biggest game of the
‘” year

maybe of their lives. All will
certainly experience that feeling that
comes when such big games come
along.. First the heart beats harder
‘and harder. until it appcarsready to
julnp out of its rib cage. Thenthere’s
the shortness of breath. and the need
to hit something. to do something
physical.

Players will be pacing their
roolns. trying to pass those seein-
ingly endless hours. trying to get
the.lnselves tired. Until....

(ialne day. But a blur is going
around each individllal player. as in
their own little world they attain that
pitch. that controlled
rage needed to get ready for football
games. Football games as big as the
Pitt-Penn State game on Saturday.

(ialnes. however. are rarely won
on emotion alone. Teams might per-
forln better with it. but it won‘t win it
for yotl. About five lninlltes into
Saturday‘s game. when the huge
“high“ will subside and players‘ tal-
ents will take over. the blocks. tack-
les and passes will have to be lnade
to win the game. No. emotion can
carry a team. bllt it can't win games.

The game is shaping up as an exer-
cise in assertiveness. Whichever
team can assert its brand of play will

 

" M ,win the game. because both brands

are so different.

The Penn State Nittany l.ions.
like their uniforms and their coach.
are a conservative team. How con-
servative‘? like three pitchouts to
Curt Warner and pllnt. l)on‘t throw
unless you have to. It is a strategy
that has gotten them in trouble.

Against Alabama and Miami
(Fla.). Penn State Coach .loe
Patcrno showed little imagination.
and his team was rejected nlllnerotls
times froln crossing the end /one
when it was bllt a hair length away.
But. as a tried axiom says. you go
with your best.

 Your best is.a huge offensive line

at punishes people when it tries to
get its hand on stlper-talented tail-
back Warner. Not unlike Pitt‘s
offensive line. the Lions are big and
quick but oh. so predictable.

No matter how good you are. if‘

you run the same pla_ys. defenses will
adjust. Such was the ‘case against
Miami. when State consistently

tried the" wide pitch to Warner and ‘

consistently was shut down.

Penn State
(above), and Pitt's Julius
Dawkins (right), are two of
the more potent offensive
weapons in the game. The
No. 1 Pitt defense (below) has
to overcome a large size dis-
advantage against the Nittany
Lions. A
But when you can rtln at a clip of
257 yards a game. it is rare that
anyone can stop you. If a nyonc can.
however. it could be Pitt. who has
been the stingicst team in the coun-
try when it comes to giving up yard-
age on the ground. This battle will be
phase one in importance of winning
the game.

Should Penn State eolne out and
manllandlc the Panther defensive
line. crunching up yardage and valu-

able time off the clock. timetl_lat will
be taken out of Marino‘s arm. then
Pitt is in trouble.

it won‘t happen. Pitt‘s front five
will shut down the Penn State rlln-
ning game and force lion quarter-
back Todd Blaekledgc to throw the

Sherrill. “This game means a lot to

‘‘I‘m not from around here. but it‘s

said Pitt defensive tackle Phil Pul-
/uoli. a native of Stanford. Conn. “lt
rllbs off on you the tradition the
coaches instill in you. I want to win it
just as lnuch as anybody else.”

Though the motivation _for each
team is different. it should be equally
powerful for both. Besides the usual
claim on the.state’s bragging rights.
which Pitt has held the last two
years. the No. l Panthers are within»
reach of some larger claim
national bragging rights.

Penn State. on the other hand. is
trying to shake the effects of a 2-2
slide in its last four games. nothinga
victory this Saturday couldn‘t cure.

V “We‘re trying to pull our season
together.“ says Farrell. Penn State‘s
All—Amcrica honoree. A win in The
(lame could make the season for the
Fiesta Bowl-bound Lions.

lt’s'*not only a game. but a grudge
match. a battle for victory among
not only the players. but the fans and
the colnpcting coaches as well.
Though neither team‘s coaching
staff would likely admit it. the dark
sentiments the game evokes flow
equally deep in their blood.

an awful lot of people. You can’t call -

Sherrill.

There was the famous cleat inci-
dent in I979. when Penn State
Coach .loe Paterno complained that
Pitt‘s players were wearing illegally-
long spikes to get an extra edge on
the Beaver Stadium grass turf. a sur-,
face the Panthers rarely play on.

For controversy. this I981 game
doesn‘t disappoint anybody for
your pleastlrc. we introduce not one.
but two: The Big East and The Not-
so-(ircat Schedule Debate.

After Pitt pushed Penn State's
athletic department to the brink ofa
nuclear implosion. following Pitt‘s
decision to join the Big East basket-
ball league. instead of an Eastern
all-sports conference. Paterno‘s pet
project. a stinging quote surfaced
this week in a New Jersey
newspaper.

The statement was that Pitt had‘
gone ahead and joined the lucrative
Big Fastjust to land a blow on Penn
State. since they allegedly turned
Pitt in to the NCAA earlier for lb
recruiting violations. The source of
the statement was given only as “a
Penn State assistant coach."

“l think he‘s talking out of his..."
started to say. then
amended. “I don‘t put a lot ofcredit
in things people say without putting
their name on it."

Sherrill took over the coaching
spot at Pitt in I977. word has never
sltlfntred of any Pitt recruiting
Vlt s.

'I -.'.‘It_' is the Pitt schedule
much-maligned and often men-
tioned before “! ;.'ent" as people seek
to explain Pit‘ s mexpectcd rise to
the top of l.l- tlege football polls.

“PittTs tough schedule has
included teams like Rutgers. Tem-
ple. and Thiel. hasn‘t it?" Penn State
linebacker Chet Parlavecchio told’
the Pittsburgh Press. “This week
they‘ll be facing Ll‘ football team
when they face us.“

.“|‘m amused. He's a pretty funny
guy." PU’/’/U()ll retorted yesterday.
“You just have to laugh at that.
Since were I()—(). they have to find
something to ridicule. lf weiwin our
next two games. it will provethat the
schedule didn‘t mean anything."

While the teams.may differ on
scheduling and recruiting issues.
both agree that emotion will charac-
teri/e this year‘s game. which returns
to Pitt Stadium for the first time
since I977.

“I guarantee you. there’ll be lnore
than h5.(l()() people in the staditlln if
they have to crash the gates down."

’ Sherrill said. "lt’s gonna be just a

great. intense game. A lot of these
players have gone to high school
together. played ill the Big 33 game
together. and know each other.

“Regardless of what happens. I
guarantee you there will be 22 gtl_vs
on the field playing their hearts out."

And it‘s not that he has nobody to
catch the ball either. Kenny .Iack-
son. (ireg (iarritty and Kevin Baugh

Pitt receivers .Iu|ius I)awkins. Barry

You think Sherrill isjust talking

how good the Penn State offense can
be. and it must make him smile a
little when the receivers are just
about taken out of the offense.

It is something Paterno can ill
afford to do Saturday. With such a
strong rushing defense as Pitt’s (only
the best in the country statistically).
throwing on first down would be
advisable. if not eventually
mandatory.

By passing on first down. Penn"

State could catch Pitt in a run sup-
port defense and also create holes.
eventually. when Pitt’s linemen. in
expectation of the pass. take strong
rush routes. Draws and screens
would then eat up yardage.
Sounds easy. doesn‘t it‘? But if
Penn State can successfully throw
the pass on first down and soften up
the Panther defense. i« just might be.

What Paterno will probably do isxi
counter with an extra linebacker or
defensive back. Paterno is well-
stockcd with linebackers: he came
out with a six-linebacker defense
against wishbone-oriented Ala-
bama. F.xpect him to come up with
the same wrinkle against Pitt or

maybe a blit/. although Marino is
very cool in reading a blit/. A
-It‘s almost a no—win situation for
the Penn State defense. Against the
much more balanced attack of Pitt.
Paterno‘s challange is much deeper
than Sherrill's. Stop the Penn State
run and you pretty much have them.
Stop the Pitt run. then deal with
Marino. Stop the Pass. then deal
with the Pitt running game. If Penn
State’s running attack is very strong.
then Pitt's running game is merely
strong. Bryan Thomas. a mere
shadow for three years. has emerged
from a crowd oftailbacks to rush for
near |.(l()() yards. while Wayne
DiBartola has shown to be quite effi-
cient at coming out of the backfield

Bryan Thomas’ running this year has helped the Pitt offense
diversify its attack and increase its unpredictability.

Pitt linebacker Sal Sunseri is glad to ‘win All-America

DifferentyPaths to All-America

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt linebacker Sal Sunseri
and quarterback I)an Marino.
two key figures in Pitt‘s I98!
national championship drive.
were named to the l9Xl Kodak
All-America Team yesterday by
the American Football Coaches
Association (AFC/\). ,

For Marino. Pitt's record-
breaking junior ‘passer. the
award was not as unexpected as
it was for Sunseri. the senior who
is generally regarded as the fiery.
spiritual leader of the No. I-
ranked Pitt defense. .

Though he was mentioned as'a
possible pre-season All-East can-
didate. Sunseri did not make any
of the pre-season All-America
teams. a slight he says made him
buckle down even harder this
year. . '

“It gave me an incentive to
work“ harder individually
actually. I should thank them."
Sunseri. Pitt‘s leading tackler.
said yesterday. “I‘ve never
worked harder off and on the
field than I have this year."

To Sunseri. that meant more
weightlifting. more running and

more film-watching than he did

in any of his three previous sea-
sons at Pitt.

Though Sunseri knew he was
in the running for theihonor. he
says he still didn’t expect it.

“I’m just really happy. It
means a heekuva lot to me. espe-
cially sinee I have a brother.

Mellon and woti All-America

honors.“ Sunseri said. “I always
wanted to be an All-America.
especially a Kodak All-America.
because now I get to meet Bob
Hope.“ V

No kidding. In
December.

early
both Sunseri and

Marino will join the rest of the

Kodak team in Phoenix. Ari/..
fora weekend. The Kodak team

is an annual feature on I-Iope‘s

NBC Christmas show.

Though Marino didn‘t men-
tion being excited about meeting
Ilopc. he was also ecstatic about
the All-America award.

“I’m extremely happy."
Marino said. “It‘s not only a
credit to me. but also the people I

 

play with. They take pride in me.
and I take pride in them. It‘s a
great honor.“

Marino. who is also one ofthe
top three or four Heisman
Trophy candidates this season.
and Sunseri are both products of
Pittsburgh’s Central Catholic
High School. located about four
‘blocks down Fifth Avenue from
the Pitt campus.

After that though. the.similar-
ity ends between -the two players
who came out of high school one
year apart. ‘Marino. from the
start. was highly recruited by Pitt
and head Coach .Iackie Sherrill.
while Sunseri took a more unu-
sual route. Sunseri recruited
Sherrill.

“I went to Tulsa for one da_v.
and I transferred. I was a walk-
on here my first year." Sunseri
said.

“I wanted to play for Pitt. I
was out driving my cat r one da_v
and I saw Shcrrill drive by. so I
l‘ol.lo\ved him. I drove right up
into his driveway and told him I
wanted to play football for him."
Sunseri recalled. “He said ()K.
but I‘d have to try out-as a walk-
on." The rest is an All-America
success story.

Though his Pitt career has
been far from regrettable. Sun-
seri still laughs and winces about
his spur—of-the—momcnt antic
that got him on the team initially.

“I think. “What a jerk I had to
be.'”'Sunseri said. laughing. “He
(Sherrill) probably thought he
was getting mugged." '

By MARIE HUFF

Yes. Lady Panther basketball
fans. there is a National College.
After glancing at the l98|-82 Pitt

schedule. it seems that Coach Judy .

Saurer and her staffhave followed in
the steps of the football team.
Names such as Fairmont State. Nia-
gara. Bowie State and National Col-
lege jumped off the schedule and
said. “Here I am. a mediocre team.
Play me! I'll help you get the
national recognition you want. Who
knows maybe we can help you
crack the Top 20!"

Well. the Lady Panthers certainly
have a basketball schedule that can
help attract national attention to
their record. which should havea lot
more wins than losses. but it is far
from a piece of cake.

Saurer and her charges will play a
29-game schedule that features
seven pre-season Top 20 teams.
Only four of the Pitt‘s opponents

this year had losing records last sea-~

son. One of these. South Carolina.
was l3-l 7 only because it had to for-
feit eight games for using an ineligi-

If Pitt does not meet South Caro-

South Carolina Coach Pam Par-

Jackson a Rare

"By scan DELLETT

For an athlete to achieve All-

'America status for one year is an

honor many people have never ex-

. perieneed. To have a chance to do it

for a fourth time. and then contem-
plate giving it all up. seems even
more unusual.

After last season. however. Pitt
swimmer Amy Jackson thought
about giving it all up. The fact that
only four other iI’itt athletes

I football’s Tony I)orsett and Hugh

(ireen. and "swimmers Kathy Stetler
and Suzanne Pulley had ever done
it before didn‘t fa/e .lackson. Her
lack of interest did.

. “I was suffering from a lack of
interest in the sport after last sea-

son.” Jackson said. “I reached all my
goals in my sophomore ‘year. andl
didn‘t do as well last year. so I
wanted to quit.

“Denise Sedlacek and Julie Ter-
rell help keep me going.“ .lackson
continued. “They made me get
something out of swimming. no
matter how well I do.“

young age. .lackson didn‘t swim
competitively until she was lo.
Rather. she participated in gymnas-
tics and field hockey.

The injuries she suffered while
participating in these sports made
Jackson turn to swimming.

“I knew how to swim at an early
age. but I preferred to participate in
other sports." she said. “When I
started to receive injuries in those
sports. I decided to take up swim~
ming since thcre‘s less chance of an
injury occuring."

Jackson said her relatively late
start in competitive swimming may
have helped her more than it hurt.

“I felt it was to my advantage to
take Lip swimming late. because
swimmers who start early usually get
tired ofthe sport and end up giving it
up." Jackson said.

Swimming also gave Jackson
power over her own success. as
opposed to gymnastics and diving.
where judges determined ‘the per—
formance of the competitors.

“I liked the aspect of being able to
control your own finishes." Jackson
said. “(()ften. in other meets) if a

judge didn‘t- like the team. the
members of that team would receive
a lower score." .

After winning high S"t‘l]()()_l All—
America honors at Radnor High
School near Philadelphia. Jackson
contacted Pitt‘s Head (‘oach I)ick
Bradshaw about swimming for the
I.ady I’anthe_rs. 4 «

“There was interest by both par-

ties. but I initiated the move by send-
ing Bradshaw a letter." she said.
' .lackson was given a partial
scholarship. which was one of the
reasons she wanted to gain All-
America status her freshman year at
Pitt.

“With my t_wo older
alrcady—thr’ough college. my parents
had to pay off the loans." Jackson
said. “If I won All—America honors.
I would receive a full scholarship
from the university."

The extra incentive paid ‘off. as
Jackson earned All—America honors
in the l()()—meter butterfly. the 2()()
and 4()l)—mcteri relay team and the
4()()—mcter medley relay team.

.lackson reached her peak in her
sophomore year. when she earned
All-America honors in the 50-. I()()-.
and 2()()—meter butterfly. the l()()—
and 200-meter freestyle and the 400-
mctcr freestyle relay.

Following her “disappointing”
season last year. during which she
was All-America in the 4()()—meter
freestyle relay and the X()()—meter
freestyle medley. Jackson prepared
differently for her senior campaign.

Last summer was the first summer
that I stayed out of competitive
swimming." Jackson said. “I kept in
shape by running and lifting
weights. but I didn‘t have the back-

sisters

- ground of swimming all summer.

She added. “Last summer helped
my attitude towards swimming. I
came into school ready to swim."

The change of head coaches also

ncxer know what to expect. while
with Bradshaw. you could.

“I)r. Belowich is highly motivated
and he has high goals for the team.
His enthusiasm rubs off on the
team." .

Bclowich also has a great deal of
respect for his senior swimmer.

“Amy is a tough competitor who
does not like to get beat." said Belo-
wieh. “She is also a yery stable leader

w‘1io sets form example (in her 

strokes). She always does a good job A
at practice.
"She makes my job a little easier.”
Although there is added pressure
on Jackson this year. both she and
Bclowich agree that it can be easily

_ controlled.

“The pressure is within niysclf."
said Jackson. “this is my senior year.
and I want to go out and get this
goal." . I

Belowich said. “Amy has ha ndlcd
the pressure well. She is a dedicated

and talented lady who works ha rdto

reach her goals."
After this year. Jackson says she_

has no plans to remain active llllgfg;

swimming. as either a team member
or coach.

“'l'his' is it." she said. “Coaching is
out because it takes too much time
and there is no reward. It is also
difficult to keep on swimming.
because of the lack of facilities and a
team."

Instead. Jackson said she will
pursue a career in architectural
drafting and may take up running.

“My dad is a marathon runner.
and. if I can. I would like to run one
with him.“ Jackson said.

But for the time being. Amy .lack—
son is in pursuit of a goal few colle-
giate athletes achieve in their

averaging 26.2 points and 9.9

counting on a freshman to fill the
void at center. where the l.ady Ti-
gers lost (iretehen Becker and Barb

And then there is National Col-

deceive you. The l.akers ﬁnished last

anxious to play the big teams.
National College. along with Clem-

The East is quickly becoming a
dominating force in women's bas-
ketball. This year. four teams from
the East hit the Top 20 in the pre-
season polls. Cheyney State is
ranked seventh. Maryland llth.
Rutgers l3th. and Penn State 20th.
Pitt will face all four teams in the
latter half of the season. Only the
Maryland contest will be at home.

Cheyney State will be coming off

however.

“We‘re going down there (to Ala-

A quick team like Pitt tends to get
off to an extremely fast start until
the opponent gets accustomed to its

 .‘peed. The problem. then. is trying
to hold on to the lead. and if you‘re

not a good shooting team. like last

 Pitt Schedule a Stiff Test

All three teams Cheyney. Mary-
land and Rutgers have been a
thorn in the Lady Panthers” side.
Pitt has yet to win a game against
any of them. A

The fourth team to break into the
pre-season Top 20 is Penn State.
The Lady Lions may not be able to
keep this position very long. though.
As of last week. All-America candi-
date Corrine Gulas was not on the
roster. and neither was her twin sis-
ter. Chris. Penn State has given no
explanation.

The loss of the (iiulas sisters may
leave the Lady Lions quite weak at-
the guard position. Penn State may
also suffer from the rigors ofa tough
schedule which includes trips to
Tennessee and Louisiana Tech. Ten-
nessee is ranked second and Louisi-
ana Tech first on the pre-season
charts.

Pitt has an All-America canidi-
date in junior Pam Miklasevich.
Along with Miklasevieh are (iail
Aughburns. who Saurer calls “one
of the best centers in the East." the
incomparable Debbie Lewis. and an
aggressive defensive player with a
dangerous" outside shot Carol
Dugan. And one thing the Lady
Panthers have this year that was
lacking in other years is a strong.
reliable bench. lt could mean the dif-
ferenee between a season ofcelcbra-
tion and a season of despair.

TOUCH OF GOLD: Has
been in the wholesale busi-
ness for three years. They
purchase their gold directly

“from a manufacturer in Italy

so they eliminate all middle
men, that's why we guaran-

tee our prices to be the ,‘

lowest in town. (We sell
our merchandise by the
weight so you‘ can compare
our prices to anyone’s.)
We have over 500 gold 14K T
chains, bracelets, charms,
earrings and pendants to
select from. Soon, we will
be carrying Pulsar watches
and we do repair work like
replacing‘ watch and cal-
culator batteries. Buy your
wedding bands from us for
30°/o over our cost.

1 HAPPY House GIFT SHOP:

Has been in business over
23 years in Oakland. We
have over thousands of dif-
ferent gift items to fill your
needs, fresh homemade
candy, cards for all occas-
ions, pictures, clocks and
many more gift items to sel-

ect from.
