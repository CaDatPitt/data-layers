Opinions Survey

  Reveals Radicals’

Influence in East
(See editorial, page 2)
By JOE BELDEN, Editor
Student Opinion Surveys of America.‘

AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 6.—Com-I
munist, socialist, and fascist;
propaganda among college stu-I
dents is being felt mainly in the
East Central and Middle Atlantic
states.

But even at it's peak effects,
scarcely 20 per cent of the students
in any area have had any contact
with the doctrines of a radical group.

This is shown by a nation-wide
poll taken by the Student Opinion
Surveys of America just as the Dies
committee ended its investigation of
un-American activities and is mak-
ing preparations for another.

Local results on the question of
the Student Opinion Surveys show
that only four people of the sixty
interviewed considered that they
had been inﬂuenced by communist,
socialist or fascist propaganda.

Two upperclassmen said that
they had studied it as part of
econo-mics and political science
courses. The third person, a fresh-
man, said that a minister who had
spoken at a campus meeting seemed
“communistic.” The fourth “yes”
answer was from a sophomore who
was invited by a fellow student to
a “radical meeting.”

No one interviewed refused to
answer the question.

The committee questioned profes-
sors of a New York college and other
witnesses when it directed its search
for propaganda to the college and
university ranks of the nation. What
those people have seen and heard
went into the record‘—but what about
the views of the students themselves
who- are now supposedly being be-
sieged with a multitude of “isms?”

The Student Opinion Surveys of
America for the first time point out
what the collegians have to say in
all sections of the country. Although
when the results are taken nationally
one student in every ten says there
has been some attempt to inﬂuence
him, the poll reveals that student
bodies in the West and South are
very seldom approached with such
propaganda.

A staff of interviewers have asked
this question to a carefully selected
cross-section of students of all de-
scriptions: “Has any attempt been
you with communism, socialism, or

fascism?” By geographical sections, -
they have answered:
Yes No

Vaughn Reveals
Plans for Tuxedo
Exchange Agency

To give students, who do not
have the use of a tuxedo an oppor-
tunity to attend "formal dances,
Men’s Council has started a Tux-
edo Exchange Agency.

According to William Vaughn,
BA41, chairman of the agency,
“It’s a new idea in the University,
and we hope. it will meet with suc-
cess.”

Tuxedosareto be supplied by
students who wish to rent them out
to other students. The idea will
be worked on a non-proﬁt basis for
Men’s Council.

The agency is to start rental of
tuxedos and tails for the Junior
Prom. Any student wishing to
rent out his suit, or to secure a suit
for the dance, should ﬁll in the
blank on Page 4.

The rental fee is set by the stu-
dent who owns the suit.

G~ral1am°’s Classes Rank Sudeten
Crisis Year’s Qutstanding News

I

The year 1938 will be remembered¢m

as the year in which Germany played
the leading role on the stage of world
events.-

This7was brought out in a survey
recently conducted by Robert X.
Graham, instructor of journalism and
director of the University news serv-
ice. Mr. Graham polled his journal-
ism classes to ﬁnd their selection of
the three best news stories of 1938.

Eighteen leading news stories of
1938 were listed on the ballot, and
from this number the students listed
their three choices. Stories were
judged_on their wide appeal to all
classes of readers and other qualities
such as timeliness, proximity, promi-
nence, and consequence.

Events in which Germany partici-
pated took first, second, and third
places in the poll.

A majority of the students placed
the Sudeten crisis, which culminated
in the Munich pact; first on their bal-
lots. Others placed it second or
third.

Selected for second place was Ger-
many’s anti-Semitic campaign. Ger-
many’s union with Austria placed
third on the ballot. « »

Corrigan’s “wrong-way” ﬂight to;
Ireland, the New England hurricane, 
development of United States foreign I
policy leading to the Lima co11fer—I
ence, and Orson Welles’ sensational;
Martian broacast, were runners-up I
for third place. I

Howard Hughes’ world ﬂight and;
Republican gains in off-year elec-I
tions were selected by many as stor— -
ies that ranked as either the second-
or third best of the year. .

Although international affairs dom— I
inated as leading stories,--such domes- '
tic happenings as the enactment of-
wages and hours law and the trial of ,
Tammany leader Hines were consid- ,
ered by several of the voters. I

One student placed John Ward’s:
leap from a New York hotel as his;
choice for second best story of the?
year. '

Other stories listedcn the ballotl

‘were: Franco-Italian colonial crisis, ' ing Board of WSGA. i

confession of Richard VVhitney of the I
New York stock exchange, fall of I
Hankow before the Japanese, the I
Soviet treason trials, Mexico’s appro- I

RIN TED on the front page of today’s News are results
of the third in the series of college polls being conduct-
cd by the Student Opinion Surveys of America, Inc. The
current poll, 'il.ll'l€l_V' in liglit of the Dies coniniittce report
to C()l1f,;'l'CSS, shows. that "un-Aiiiei-icaii” tinﬂiiciicc on col.-
lc.;;'c and 1ll1lV0l‘>,‘.ll'_\' students has becii 1‘0lll8_l'l{2ll')l_'\' slight.
. Althoiigh the ﬁg_;'i1i'es submitted proved quite inter-
cs.ti.iig, we were a little disappoiiitcd in the way tl1c_v were
-handled by tlic siirvcy f_;'l‘Oll1). In its <_)1'igi1iz1l form, the re-
lcasc stressed the scctioiial tli,ii’c1-<‘-ii1:ials, Glllpl1tlSlZll’lf;;' that
lliltllly niorc s.:tiicl<_-iits in the inid<lle atlantic and cast cen-
tral states were approaclicd by scl.iciiiiiig coniniunists, so-
<:ia'li:-:i‘:<, and :I’as<;-i:<ts.

Tliat this fact is quite iiiipcrtaiit we 1'cadily coiiccdc.
“But it sceins only natural, that in nio1'c~ liiglily industrial-
ized and lll(')l'(* populous and articiilatc localities, the-fo1'ces
of })l‘(>1):l.g'tll'l.(l£l should be inore active and siic.cessf‘ul than
in otlicrs.

The important point, and one that the _Slll"\'G_V appears
to have ll/llSSC(l, is that a suiiprisiiigly small niinority of
students have been touche(l by “un-Ainei.-ican” propa-
ganda. Absolute top for “siibvcrsivc” inﬂuences was
rcaclictl in the local, Middle Atlantic area, with 19.5 per
cent. Most areas, liowerer, were. far be.low this figure, low
1)(51‘(3Glliag,'(§ being west central with -L22.

Even on the local campus, wlicrc student ;.groups have
often been under ‘lire for allege(lly “.raclical” activities,
only four students out of 60 approached by The News in-
terviewer declared that an attempt or attempts had been
made on campus to influence them with coniniunisin, so-
cialism, or fascism.

These facts, we think, are sigiiiﬁcant in those ‘times
when loose-lippcd legislators are (lippi1i.g_»; into the always
politically useful red licrriiig pail; when newspaper pub-
li.shci's are bcgiiiiiiiig to capitalize. on a public thirst for
spy sciisatioiis and international diiplicitics; when a jit-
tery 1‘-.atio1i, pi'cpa1‘i1ig_,»' for war, is juinping at cve1'_v sug-
g'('..‘-‘.l.l(l'il of “un—Anicricanisni.”

Thus, that lon5.;*—ti1i1e centc1' of ill-repute as the breed-
ing place of radicalism and subversive activities, the"col-
lcge,cai1ii1;)iis, is sliown, by cold, hard facts, to be 1'clativel_v
iiino-cent. Evidentl_\', the “red, red schooll1ouse.,” if ren-
(lcrcd iiniiiuiic froiiithe periodical (lalll)ll1g'S of uiiinforined

Thus, it orders that its former saint and ‘idol, the
late prcsidcnt-Masaryk be even denied the concession of
liaiigiiig in peace on the lcgatioii walls of a coiiiitry which
owes its vei'_v c.\'istcncc to his inspiration. That the ‘first

Nazi ncurotics would quite naturall_v be in the disfavor of
a “1'eorg'a1iized” t'.()lllll7l'}' which has, partly of necessity,

tarian cultures; its people, led by stupid politicians, are
surely and llOpBl€SSl_\' bewildered.

So the Pragiic order to the VVashingto11 legation
conics a.s no surprise. It is only an inevitable hangover
from that fall day not so long‘ ago when the C‘hamberlains
and ‘Daladiers dropped a hot potato which friend Hitler
was only too anxious to skin.

FILMED IN TECHNICOLOR

This column was written for pub-
lication in the final prc-Christmas
issue of The News. In justice to critic
Colker, we feel compelled to explain

that this column contained the first

“ten best” selections of the season,
although lack of space prohibited
publication until toclay’s issue.—The
Editor.

Just to give you something to con-
sider and me something to write

about before we both start think- 7

ing again this year, here is my list
of the ten best movies of 1938.

“The Citadel”—for its daring sur-
gery on the body of medical ethics;

“You Can’t Take It With You”—for.

its satire on Ameriacn idiosyncrasies;

"‘Boys’ Town”———l‘or its human treat-‘

inent of the rehabilitation of youth
and boyhood problems.
‘Algiers’ Make Top Ten

“Algiers”—for its handling of a
psychological problem of an inform-
er, and for Hedy Lemarr, the photo-
genic discovery of the year; “Block-
ade”—1'or its fearless presentation of
a story with social signiﬁcance; “The
Amazing Dr. Cliterhouse” — for its
novel scientific analysis of criminals.

“That Certain Age”’—for its sym-
pathetic understanding of adolescent
infatuation; “The Judge Hardy Ser-
ies”—-for its homey characterization
of the typical American family; “Too
Hot To Handle”——for its action, fast
and different. and kaleidoscopic
scene; and “Brother Rat”—-for its de-
licious comedy in depicting life at a
military school.

The one foreign picture which is
the best of the lot, but which will
not be included in any “best” list
because of its limited distribution, is
“Grand Illusion,” now in its second
week at the Art Cinema.

French made, it is the story of

‘ lines.

‘example of high art and an inspiring

Frenchmen in German prison camps
during the World War. It might have
been hysterical, but it chose to dig
deeper and present mental conﬂicts

There isn’t one battle scene in it,
just men in prison camps learning to
sit back and say to each other:
“What is it all about?” Their one
automatic response, however, is
their attempts to escape. And there-
by hangs the plot and its suspense.

No Sentimentality

The ﬁlm has no sloppy sentimen-
tality. There is no bragging about
French supremacy over Germany
or Britain or Russia. The soldiers
are human beings thrown together in
the crazy-quilt of war, learning to
understand one another.

Guards are glad when prisoners
escape, enemies share mutual delight
in heroism, frontiers are imaginary
From all this, is intended a
better comprehension of the humane
realities. Quoting H. V. Kaltenborn.
“It is a story of man’s humanity to
man told with ﬁne artistry. As an

times.”

ture?

Guaging national sentiment is now one of the ﬁner arts.

machinery, we won’t make any claim to reveal exactly what the

masses are thinking these days.

So,

Yale’s Aces

Husky Elis Smash

Panther Defense

Our informants from Ann Arbor,
Columbus, Hanover, Ithaca, New
Haven, Chicago, South Bend, Phila-
delphia, and Cleveland were not re-
luctant to tell us that as far as their
respective constituents were con-
cerned, Pitt was now deﬁnitely the
horrid word. After these respective
bracers, we reached for a sweet, but
came up with the following:

“Around Philadelphia Pitt is now
the nation’s number one laughing
stock and this opinion covers
more territory than the Penn campus
. it will take ten years for the
reputation that was established in
the-last few months from being elim-
inated in the mid—west, if then” .

One young man, already success-
fully embarked upon what should be
a very fruitful coaching career had
this to say. “No greater obstacle
could be placed in the way of a Pitt
alumnus trying to get ahead in
coaching at another school than the
publicity over the recent freshman
-episode. This really makes things
tough for fellows like us.”

A member of the staff of a distin-

guished Ivy League institution re-
imarked, quite ﬁrmly. “in being very
honest I must say that there is a
very slight possibility of any last-
ing relationship being established be-
‘tween Pitt and our school, despite the
policy change. The tradition, the
background just isn’t there.”

Greeks Swing Into Action
On F our Athletic Fronts

Starting right in where they left?

off, preceding Christmas vacation
the interfraternity athletes resumed
hostilities Wednesday for the pos-
session of the “All—Point” trophy.

The fraternity sportsmen swung
into action the opening school day
of the new year with bowling, ping
pong, and volleyball and then ate
plenty of their favorite breakfast
food in preparation for the basket-
ball games scheduled for last night
and this evening.

Completing this week’s activities,
the Greeks will head for Trees Gym

tomorrow for a dash of volleyball‘

and pihg pong.

A check-up of past performances
show Delta Tau Delta out in front
and pulling away from the ﬁeld in
ping pong. Paced by such stalwarts
as “Ollie” Hurst, “Ham” Hamilton,
Dan Cannon and Jim Kennedy, the
Delts look like a sure-fire winner to
cop first place honors in this sport.
These four racquet wielders easily
rank with the outstanding players
in school, with “Ollie” Hurst a fa-
vorite to capture the school tourna-

ment succeeding “Vic” Reiter as
school champion.
Defending champion, Theta Chi,

and Phi Delta Theta have as yet
to meet defeat at the Strand Alleys
in the bowling league. Sigma Chi,
always a threat_in this sport, trails
the leaders with only one loss.

The report from Cleveland, after
combining the other more unpleasant
details, was couched in bewilder-
ment. “Why up there, Western Re-
serve is trying to go big time in the
hardest way.” And with Karl Davis,
former Pitt athletic director, leading
the athletic way, the Red Cats are
making a very pronounced advance-
ment.

While three thousand Duquesne
Garden rooters alternately cheered
and gasped, Yale’s powerful icers
turned on a deadly brand of hockey
last Tuesday to swamp the previous-
ly undefeated Panthers 11-0.

For the Mcsorleymen, it was their
third game in ﬁve days, a 1-0 deci-
sion having been achieved at the ex-
pense of an inspired Case team last
Thursday with a Huntington, West
Virginia, amateur club taking a 2-0
defeat the following night.

Prep School Stars

The lighter, less experienced Pitt
squad was never a match for the
hard skating, smooth passing Bull-
dogs who wore out their opponents
by constantly substituting lines and
defenses of former prep school aces.

The Elis tallied after only three
minutes, 59 seconds of the ﬁrst pe-
ried, Barnes outskating the defense
and ﬁring past goalie Ellis from four
feet out. McLennan, brilliant Yale
center, whipped another shot into
the corner of cage at 6:51.

Dave Rodd, a sub for McLennan,
took a pass from defenseman Kite to
score at 13:29, then broke loose to
flash the light unassisted 44 seconds
later. Three of the Yale scores in
the opening period were made with a
Panther in the penalty box.

"Panthers Tighten

The Pittites tightened up in the
second period and held Yale score-
less for nearly eight minutes, but
McLennan passed to right wing
George Curtis at 7:54 to make the
score 5-0 and McLennan followed by
outmanieuvering Ellis at 8:05.

A stiff defense held the Bulldogsl

0 =1: 4: :2
It was no more than we expected

during the recess, when the Cornells
and the Yales came to town, to‘
notice the predominance of camel’s
hair coats and crew-cut haircuts.
But, it seemed that things were be-
ing carried a little too far when, to
perform the very ordinary task of
administering the towel, at every
time out, the Cornell trainer strode
out onto the floor all bedecked in a
Chesterﬁeld coat. He left his derby

on the bench.

* * :3:

Someone ﬁnally came out and said
the thing that we’ve known all the
time, but have been waiting for I
someone else to say since the gridiron
season ended. It was Wallace ‘Wade,
although we don’t exactly appreciate
the circumstances under which he
said it. “Pitt was the best football
team in the country.” Yes, we knew
it all the time. But, they don’t seem
to pay off on what you are. Instead,
it’s, “Who’d you ever lick?”

in check until the final two minutes
of the session, when Cusick, last man
in front of the goalie, drew a trip-
ping penalty and a subsequent pen-
alty shot.

Clem. Kite ﬁred for Yale and his
waist high attempt bulleted past
Ellis whomade a ‘desperate but futile
attempt to save. McLennan and Cur-
tis added unassisted tallies at four-
teen and ﬁfteen minutes respectively.

Where Oceans of Collegiate Atmosphere Prevails

Sophomore F loormen Win
Three During Holidays;

Await Conference Start

By Bill Mazefsky
This was supposed to be an off season for the Pitt basketball team
. . . but with four of the ﬁrst ﬁve games tucked away in the victory
chest, Dr. Carlson’s basketball boys turn to the remainder of tlie

schedule in full victory stride.

After dumping Northwestern in the season opener, the Panthers
were detoured by Bradley Tech. one of the country ’s greatest quin-

Delaware during the week ending
December 17.

Firing four positions, the Pitt team
scored 1,796 out of a possible 2,000
points to the 1,704 scored by Dela-
ware. High men on the Pitt squad
were Schaper—367, Paris—-367, Bur-
ki—361, La Spada—351,‘C. Eagle
—350.

tets. Since then Richmond, Duke,¢
and Cornell have—like the old In-
juns-—bitten the dust in rapid suc-
cession.

The dust biting routine of Cornell,
accomplished during the Christmas
races, was particularly impressive.
Rated one of the Ivy League bas-
ketball g i a n t s, _ Cornell kept Pitt
on the leash un-
til five or six
minutes before
the ﬁnal whistle.
At this point Pitt
exploded with
L a  r y Paffrath
the chief stick of
dynamite, and
the Panthers won
by a sizeable
margin.

Lacking polish

nd defensive poise, the sophomore

 

John Klein

a
packed Pittmen feature a pell-mell, '

rushing offense that demands great
stamiiia. Driving down the floor and
depositing the ball in the hoop, the
offense of the pony Panthers ﬁt Carl-
son’s pre-season nickname that
tagged them “the Enthusiasm and
Energy boys.”

While the early season games have
sent the Pitt ﬁve to every point of the
compass, the remaining thirteen en-
counters will be largelyconcentrated
in Pittsburgh. "City and sectional ri-
vals will furnish the competition.
The usual hectic ﬁght for the city
title will reach a new high.

Both Tech and Duquesne are un-
defeated, and Pitt plays these teams
three out of the next four games.
Westminster will be sandwiched in
between, and latest reports have it
basketball sandwich. The Pitt-Tech
game next Wednesday will start the
drive for the city title.

A feature of Pitt's early season play
has been their high scoring antics.
The Panthers have averaged better
than a point a minute, and 46 points
per game is the season’s average.

Basketball.”

The book, published by Funk and
Vvagnalls, will scarcely go down in
the history of 1938 literature with
such epics as “The Citadel,” “My
Country and My
People,” “Mad-
ame Curie,” or
“Ferdinand the
Bull,’’ but for
students of bas-
ketball, red hot
fans, or just be-
wildered specta-
tors, it is a thor-
oughly satisfac-
tory work.

Beginning with
a general survey
of the develop-
ment of the game ‘
from Dr. Nai- Dr- Ca"15°n
smith’s peach baskets to Dr. Carlson's
ﬁgure eight offense, the opus con-
tinues easily through two chapters
dealing with Value of relaxation and
a knowledge of fundamentals for tae
athlete; takes up the fundamentals of
footwork, passing, and shooting, of-
fering simplc gar.-its wliic-h will en-

 

able the beginner to more easily learn
these “skills,” and describes, with the
use of diagrams, several methods of
offense and continuity play.

The importance of psychology in
basketball or other competition and
the two types of defense, aggressive
and retreative, are discussed thor-
oughly as is the still somewhat em-
bryonic Reverse Offense. Training,
diet, and health are given lengthy

gestions for diet being included. The
book closes with a chapter devoted to
a summary of the advantages of ath-
letics to the individual.

“Basketball” is kept constantly in-
teresting. The book is ﬁlled with
diagrams and-photographs; the sec-
tions on skills are illustrated with 24 —

Aldisert Named Publicity
Head of ICC Conclave

T

Director to Select 7
Speaker for First
Session of Group

Miss Genevieve Blatt, executive
director of the Intercollegiate
Conference on government has
appointed Ruggero Aldisert, C-ll
as her special assistant in charge
of publicity for the annual con-
clave.

In taking this position, Aldisert
succeeds Alvin Porsche, Duquesne
university, and Joseph Zaffy, Cali-
fornia State Teachers college, co-
chairmen in charge of publicity for
last year’s conference.

Publicity for the ICG conference
entails placing the idea before the
universities and colleges of Pennsyl-
vania and obtaining a speaker for
the opening session of this model uni-
cameral legislature.

Formerly an instructor in political
science and director of Women’s De-
bating Association at the University,
Miss Blatt is now chief examiner for
the Civil Service commission of Pitts-
burgh. She is also a graduate of the
University School of Law and was
admitted to the bar a year and a half
ago.

Aldisert accompanied the 17 Uni-
versity delegates to last year’s con-
ference at Harrisburg and spent some
time in following the publicity of the
model governors’ conference.

Cwens, Druids
Plan ‘He & She’

Quiz for Dance

Preparing for the Cwen-Druid “He
and She” dance scheduled for Wed-
nesday, the co-chairmen of the re-
spective social committees, Virginia
Childress, C41, and Ruggero Aldisert,
C41, announced details of a quiz con-
test offering for the winners four
free admissions to the afternoon hop.

Beginning today and based on post-
ers located on the ground and twelfth
ﬂoors, the contest will quiz students
on material contained on four series
of posters.

The two men and two women con-
testants who answer the highest per-
centage of the questions will receive
the four awards. Only the material
found on the posters placed on the
twelfth and ground ﬂoors will be cov-
ered by the questions.

Miss Childress and Aldisert sub-
divided their combined social com-
mittee by appointing several special
committees. Mary Ruth Hosey, C41,
and Frank Mateer, C41, were placed
in charge of orchestra arrangements;
Virginia Halen, C41, and William
McElwain, C41, were appointed to
consider public relations.

Other members of the joint com-
mittee are Margaret Gibson, BA41,
Loisbelle Pryor, C41, Fred S. Robie,
C41, Irving Kaufman, C41, and
George McLaren, E41.

Propaganda Poll
(Continued from Page One)

Far Western states, it is noted inﬂu-
ence is almost negligible. But when
all the results are pooled for the en-
tire country, the sections with much
higher percentages raise the total
ﬁgure of “yes” answers to 10.5 per
cent.

And how are these students being
affected? They name personal con-
tact with other students as the most
frequent way, and in addition name
class discussions, invitations to meet-
ings, printed material, and professors
who, as a University of Minnesota
freshman put it, “are so ‘progressive’
I believe they tend toward com-
munism.”

This poll, like all others conducted
by the Student Opinion Surveys, at-
tempts merely to sound out student
thought. Perhaps students are un-
aware of propaganda. Perhaps their
individual deﬁnitions of the “isms”,
differ.

But their answers above represent
what all American college youth re-
sponds to the question, and should
not be construed to mean that one-
tenth of the students have actually
been inﬂuenced. The survey points
out only that one-tenth has felt at-
tempts at propaganda.

Chancellor Holds
Fireside Chats

First of a series of Thursday aft-
ernoon “fireside chats” between
Chancellor John G. Bowman and
students was held yesterday from
2:30 to 4:30 o’clock.

Inaugurated by the Senior Court
of WSGA, which is acting as a
hostess committee, the plans call
for a group of students to meet
with the Chancellor around the
ﬁreplace in his ofﬁce for informal
and varied discussions.

According to Edith Bart, Ed39,
chief justice of Senior Court, the
plan is the result of numerous re-
quests for these informal meetings,
with the Chancellor “very enthu-
siastic about the idea.”

At present, and until the exper-
imental period of several weeks is
over, admission to the meetings is
by invitation only. Future plans
call for open meetings at which any
student may meet and talk with
Dr. Bowman.

Members of the Senior Court are
Betty Adams, Ed39; Marie Powell,
C39; Mary Jane Patterson, C39;
Dorothy Dering, C39; and Miss
Bart.

To Consider Proposal

Plans for revision of the eighth
ﬂoor into an all-men’s ﬁoor and for
installation of a student activities in-
formation booth were approved by
Men’s Council at its last meeting of
last year. The plans will beturned
over to the administration for con-
sideration.

Robert Forsythe, C40, chairman
of the men’s ﬂoor committee, and Ed
Keiper, C40, chairman of the activi-
ties information booth committee,
presented their plans, which are
outgrowths of open discussion on the
innovations at last month’s Men’s
Council session.

Forsythe’s plan describes a lounge
on the north wing of the eighth ﬂoor,
equipped with furniture and study
lights. Adjoining this would be a
trophy room. On the opposite- end
of the ﬂoor, the south wing, the
plan calls for an entertainment hall,
to be used for afternoon tea dances,
SFA meetings, etc.

Adoption of the plan would mean
the removal of The Owl and Panther
offices, the office of R. X. Graham,
director of the University News
Service, and the eighth floor Tuck
Shop from this floor. Forsythe’s
plan recommends the retainment of
the dean of men’s office on this ﬂoor.

The activities information booth,
according to Keiper’s proposal,
would be located on the main floor
near the Fifth avenue entrance.

The purpose of the booth is three-
fold: activities information, message
exchange, and facilitation of trans-
portation for commuters.
