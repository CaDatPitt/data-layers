Slight H ike

In Enrollment ,

There’ll be only a ‘slight increase
in Pitt’s enrollment this Fall, ac-
cording to J. G. Quick, registrar.

Although more fre-shmen and
advanced students have enrolled,
applications for re-admission and
veterans have decreased. No def--
inite ﬁgures are available at pres-
ent.

Over 16,000 prep-registration kits .

have been sent to students to fa-

cilitate registration from Sept. 15‘

to 19 inclusive.

Despite the fact that many male ,

students work in industry during

the summer to earn money for.

their tuition, Dr. Quick does n0t
expect the recent steel strike, to
affect enrollment.

i The freshman orientation program, has taken on a new‘ .

look this Fall.

Program chairman Morton Goldstein said the entire ori-

-entation set-up, designed to

initiate frosh to college'life,_

Courses Offered

A new set of courses, designed

A to give students a working knowl-

edge of areas of study outside their

' major field, are being offered by
the College this Fall. ,.

i Designatedin the time schedule
as General , Education (GE)
courses, the’ studies , are intended
primarily for freshmen and soph-
omores’ in the College.

The new curriculum has been
set up under the direction (if a
committee on general education,
chaired by Professor Putnam F.
Jones, of the English department.

‘According to a bulletin issued by
the committee, the new studies

‘ will not deal with the highly spe-

cialized material required bya ma-
jor in the ﬁeld. V

Instead, they ‘will “concentrate
on developing the student’s under-
standing of the principles, patterns,
meanings, implications, and. rela-
tionships that characterize a given
discipline.” »

The poli sci course, for example,
aims to assist students in _under-:.
standing the ‘value of democratic
government. - 1 ,~ .

cratic idea in the 17th and 18th
centuries,‘ and the application of

¢has been revamped.

Non-Technical 1 

The traditional dink has been
scrapped. In its place the new-
comerswill wear a blue and gold
freshman tie, to be distributed at
registration at a cost of 75 cents.

Tug-of-War Planned

All freshmen will be required to
wear the tie for at least the ﬁrst
week of school.

At the end__of that time a team
of freshmen will battle it out with
aisquad of sophomores in a tug-
of-war.

If the frosh win, they take off
their ties. If they lose, they wear
them until the. end of the orienta-
tion period.

Another new wrinkle is the con-
centration of the program into

ithre weeksinstead of six.
Concentrated Program

The freshmen will attend six
orientation classes, but they will
be scheduled for two a week, in-
stead of once as formerly.

On Wednesday of registration
week the fresh and their counsel-
lors will meet for the ﬁrst time in
their various classrooms.

Counsellors Preppep
At 6 p.m. they get together for

a .ba_nquet in Soldiers and Sailors-

Memorial.

\Thé 71 counsellors meet on
Tuesday, Sept. 16 to~~ discuss .the
program. .

They will be addressed by T. W.
Biddle, dean of men, Helen P.
Rush, dean of women, Mrs. Agnes

Pitt'has been plagued with-bad

7 Kappa chapter here. The univer-
sity’s blacklisting by the American
Association of University Profes-
sors, the small library, and a stu-
dent football demonstration when
an investigating committee had
arrived, all served to keep the
honor society off the Pitt campus.

bers are elected only from the

to‘ quit school and go into the
newspaper ﬁeld in New York,

Mar_kowitz’s resignation came in.

beginning "of September the * Pan-

Weinstein as the. new ‘editor.

A ‘senior in the College‘, ‘Wein-

Purdy and 'Weinstein said that.

“everybody” Was welcome to
work on the new magazine. In
the past there» had been criticism

groups. ‘

Many school ﬁgures had long
been"c'oncerned aboutwhat they
termed the ‘_‘poor taste” of much
of the “humor” and the resulting
bad publicity for the University.

Widespread Criticism -

Student groups, as well as.ad-
ministration groups, hit the Pan-
ther following the True Conces-
sions issue. C

The Newman Club began the
barrage when it charged the old
Pantheriwith being a “. . . vul-
gar, base and repulsive maga-
zine which is an insult to the in-
tellect of the student body . . .” -
The Club . declared that its
spokesmen would not buy, sell,
or read the magazine.

soon, afterwards attacked the “vul-
garity” of the magazine and call-
ed for cleanup measures. Student
Congress joined the attack on the
Panther.

The editor ‘of last year’s 153%-_
ther, Paul Schwa_rz, said the ma-

gazine had no intentions of print-

Recognition for the University of Pittsburgh, a
personal triumph for Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald,
and a reward for untiring efforts by interested
groups were realized Sept. 5 when the National
Convention of Phi Beta Kappa voted to establish
an oﬂicial chapter at Pitt.

A constant sore-spot in the side of University
pride,._.the absence of_a chapter

scholarship fraternity was a
working point for the 55_mem-
bers of the society included in
~the.Pitt faculty.,The‘y were aid
ed by willing, civic—minded peo

 

the importance of oﬁicialmecog
"nition. to the University. _
The stigma attached to the _ ‘
University when it was blacklisted by the Asso-
ciation of American University professors smeared
Pitt as “unﬁt” for such an‘ honor as "Phi Beta

   

T-Kappa. Another strike against the University was
, thelibrary system. Only in recent years has the

library been increased to suchproportionsthat it
it- deemed worthy of a full scale university.

lYears ago when the national society; sent. an ,

inve:::tigatiiig committee to the University, a foot-
-ball demonstration by students was inappropriately
I blasted across the campus. The committee was. not
impressed and the University was without recog-
nition. ' ' . E .
Blackball Erased

Tremendous expansion of University facilities

. and programs, undying efforts by interested per-

sons, and avid interest and commendable achieve-
ments 7by the students have ﬁnally paid off and

 I A erased the blackball.

Now we’re in. We have what we wanted and
we deserve it. ' .

But now that we have Phi Beta Kappa, what
will become of Oinicroii Delta Kappa? Heretofore
the outstanding honor society on campus, ODK-
may be shoved into comparative obscurity next

‘ spring at Tap Day. it

’ Yaers ago, a Phi Beta Kappa-less Pitt turned‘
to ODK as its top honor society for outstanding
men. Since its institution, ,ODK« has held the posi-
tion of top dog and the Senior Awardee of the
honor frat was the highest honor conferred upon
Now, with Phi Beta Kappa
generally conceded to be the highest honor society
in the nation, the issue to decide which outranks
the other ‘will be worse than a diplomatic seating ~
arrangement at one of Pearl Mesta’s dinners. ' ‘

The University will need all the resources of
its law school, debate ‘department, and possibly the

V philosophy department, in order to appease both

factions on campus and remain in good standing

with the national councils of the two societies.
‘The outstanding senior man of the year will

still be immortalized on ODK Walk; but will he be

 . worthy of the honor if he is not a Phi Beta? Will

the outstanding student be the person who attains
the highest scholastic average or will the qualities
of leadership, activity, honor, and scholarship out-
weigh the value of summa cum laude and Phi

. Beta Kappa? _ ;

Contest Predicted

Perhapsthe rival societies will be content with A‘
equal importance, but it’s doubtful. One or the other
must be adjudged THE personal triumph, and the

strong arguing points on both sides should inject

a spirit of rivalry never before seen on campus.
The contest will be a heated one, the efforts strong

' land commendable, theystakes high, and the in-

spiiation little short of tremendous.

The University will beneﬁt, the students will
beneﬁt, and the contest itself may do more to bring
Pitt the honor it deserves than recognition by either
of the societies.

The race is on. Tallyho!

eh. coach?" ’ ‘ ‘ - ' .,_. ’ "

Here Tltley Came

Thefreshmen are coming, and -it is a little hard to give
an exact forecast of what the result will be. Thewnumerical
‘additions no doubt will be~disclosed by the Registrar’s Of-
ﬁce, but the influence of these incoming freshmen will be
felt over the next four years. ‘ _,

Like a great many ofrus, the majority of the frosh, un-
fortunately, will soon begin looking for ‘courses that re-
quire light books. Many of them, following the example of
their" elders, will not want to strain either their backs or
their minds_. Whoever it was who said that the college man
was the last remenent of the American leisure class knew
of .what he said. ‘

_ But it does not have to be this way. Freshmen will find
Pitt, if they look close enough, a challenge. In their college
life they have a chance to make a good school better; they
have a chance to arise and meet head—on some of the great-
est strains and stresses that have ever tugged at young

. people.

Even thefcollege world of today is not as __far removed
from -reality as formerly was the case. The ROTC units
marching about are an adequate testimonial to that.
Besides the strains induced by the nearness of war,
there are also pressures being generated in the realm of
ideas. College -frosh, if thy’ do not already know, will ﬁnd

-. that it is often better not to go too far off the beaten track

in their ideas, lest someone’ may accuse them" of »“sub—
versive” inclinations. , _ =  ‘
The unmistakable fact that these strains exist, how-
ever, is not sufficient reason for the frosh (or for that mat-
ter, us) to throw away any thoughts we might_have had

of getting an education, and of plugging for what we be-'‘
_ lieve right. . » '

If the frosh meet the challenge that faces them, they
will leave a record that they can be proud of. We hope
they make it. " _ . ‘

We ﬁnally got it!

The addition of Phi Beta Kappa.‘ to the": 
list of honoraries on campus ought to be Wel-Q

come news to anyone genuinely concerned

with Pitt’s status among the nation’s‘ uni-_g3‘«‘
versities. The presence of the fraternityion 
campus represents a. victory for all those, of
the-faculty, administration, and alumni alike,’
who have been working for the past decade ;
scho- .

to boost Pitt’s standards of learning and
lastic achievement.

The appearance of PBK here, with a tra-”'~

dition as old as the nation and a towering.
prestige, does much to shake off the stigma

of academiclmediocrity that has plagued the l,
' school ever’ since the days -of de—em.phasis,_ _
when the whole question was the. subject _

of a long and "bitter debate.

Thatthere have been improve_ments_-since 

that time there can be no question; Entrance

iruequirements have gradually. been raised, “

study outlines for individual courseslare be-

1 ing stiffened, and efforts are constant1y}be-

ing made, to broadenlthe undergraduates‘

curriculumin the direction of the liberal "arts. T‘

In‘ short, we of the -present "generation"
come out of Pitt with a better all-around ed-
ucation than those of the last, andthe de-
cision”of the national ‘convention of PBK ‘to ’
install a chapternhere is simple recognition
of the fact. * _ _

We’re very happy about the whole thing.

Change ,

Now that the student political clubs have been‘
recognized, it is fairly certainthat students will
not have to travel outside of the Cathedral to

hear such time honored slogans as ‘‘It’s time for "I

a change.” There is little doubt that Dan Purdyfs
Young Republicans and Ross Reese’s Democrats
will exploit the ‘old sayings with an amazingly,
resh fervour. _ ‘
Although interest in the na-
tional campaign will (and
should) rise during thenext sev-
eral months, it‘ would be an un-
wise thing to forget the areas
of Pitt life which could easily
stand’ some revision.
Let us examine just two _
changes which could be made I
._ with proﬁt at Pitt. I

False Economy “~ ,
Heading the list is the frequent false economy V

  
   
 
  
   
 

"often practicedby those who divvy out the funds.

Obviously there is ‘little advantage in cutting ex-
penses if -the resulting loss costs more than the
immediate saving. ’ _ _ ‘ . '
:I‘h'e -1_1nld1,'1e,ernphasis‘up0n new buildings at the."
expense, we think, of failing to raise faculty and
administrative salaries, -means teachers unable to ,
put forth their best. There are many instructors,
who,..in order to make ends meet, must work‘ 20
to 30 hours at other jobs outside of. their teaching

assignments. Now, while some might argue ﬂipant-

ly~that it wouldbe splendid if some of our teach-

,ers did do a little work for their living, it is ob-

vious that low salaries will often be reﬂected by
poorer teaching. ’ A

Low salaries don’t meanlow tuition; they meanb
inferior education.

lrresponsibility s ,
Another “time for a change” situation at ,'Pitt
is the irresponsib1e‘attitude of certain of the stu-

dent political leaders. By irresponsibility I do not '‘

mean advocacy of something that I disagree with.
I mean the action of some leaders last spring in"
kniﬁng programs they themselves believed in. but

' opposed for personal advantage.

The prime .example of this irresponsible atti-
tude occurred during the struggle for recognition
of political clubs on campus. IMany administiation
people favored the clubs, but several students,
irked by the fact that their campus political foes
headed the groups sought to defeat,the clubs, ‘and,

were it not for a later administration decision,“_.' ;.

would have succeeded.

Last year many of the "students who tried to
sabotage the political clubs cried the loudestFfo‘r-‘

more student responsibility accompanied by greater, 
power for student.-Tgovernment’. It is hard to "see" ‘
how the Administration can be impressed. after :‘

Eight Meets Scheduled
F or Olson ’s Harriers

, g p _ by DAVE MAZER

A‘ tough. eight—meet schedule including two triangular rmeets,
six dual meets, and competition in two post-season tournaments is
on tap for the Pitt cross-country team this fall.

Coach Carl Olson began workouts last'Monday for his squad-.

Leading the distance men this year will be newly-appointed
Captain Bernie Luterancik of Mt. Lebanon. The 21-year old senior,

a three-year veteran, is consideredé:
..the team’s “ace” by Coach Olson.

Holds Course Record

Luterancik, who holds the Pitt
course record, ﬁnished among the
top ﬁve places in every meet last
year. ‘

(Points are awarded by order
of arrival at ﬁnish line in cross-
country competition. Scoring one
point for first, two for second,
right down the line. Team scoring
the" lowest number of points in
meet wins.)

Other returning lettermen in-
clude such standouts as: juniors
Don Delli Gatti, Jim Betts, Ronnie
Sallade, and Dan Sommers. or

Promising sophmores C h u c k
Fritz, Don Doyle, Richard Weber,
Alan Gunderson, Chuck Wivel, and
Jesse Wiegel, who were eligible to

-compete last year as freshmen, are

also back with the squad.

Five Lettermen Back

Last year: the harriers compiled
their best record since the war
with an impressive 6-1 slate but
Coach Olson says that “this year’s
schedule includes many schools
that have perennially strong cross-
country squads.”

Pitt, however, lost only two men,
Frank Kuzma and Ken Mahanna,
through graduation. Although both.
were outstanding runners, the
team can boast ﬁve returning let-
termen.

The varsity schedule:
Oct. 3—Westminster (Home)
Oct. 4--Geneva (Home)
Oct. 11—Ohio State (Homt)
Oct. 15—Slippery Rock (Home)
Oct. 18-—-West Virginia (Away)
Oct. 25——Navy and Georgetown (Away)
Oct. 31——Army and Syracuse (Away) ,

Even though the Interfraternity
Council decided to retire the IF
cup from competition this year,
Leo Bemis, JIM Director, is very
optimistic about the coming sea-
son.

“Competition will be just as good.
as always,” Bemis explained, “Be-
sides, after the ﬁrst few sports
were completed only a handful of
fraternities remained in the run-
ning for the trophy:’iThe other
frats still played just as hard.”

Individual trophies ‘ will be
awarded to teams that ﬁnish ﬁrst
or second in the IF league. As for
the independents, trophies are '
awarded ‘only to the winner of the
intramural championship.

New Student Director

Bemis will have a new student
IM director this year to assist the
intramural board in planningrthe
various programs. -Joe Porter, a
pre—dent senior and member of
Phi Gamma Delta social frater-
nity, succeeds Ted Broadwater,
last year’s representative.

Another new appointment in the
newly-created position of intra-

ing ace.
Gridders in Shape

Sophomore Henry Ford, Rudy
Mattioli, and Freshman Pete
Neft are each getting a crack at
the job in the morning and after-

noon sessions at Ellsworth Field. A

The rest of the backﬁeld posi-
tions have experienced perform-
ers, many of whom saw game ac-
tionlast season.

Dawson haslhad thehelp of a .

hot September sun in trimming
the squad downto playing weight.

“Except for our injuries,” he
comments, “the whole. team is in
good ‘condition. And the spirit is
wonderful.”

McCabe Insured

, The most serious injury so far

resulted in a knee operation for

Richie McCabe, Sophomore back,
which will deprive the defensive
backﬁeld of his services for half
the season.

Guard Bill Priatko also is side-
lined with a pinched nervein his
back, but the injury is not re-
garded as too serious.

On the whole, though, Pitt stands
a good chance of winning most of
its games, some observers esti-
mating as high as six. But a big
obstacle lies in the makeup of the
schedule, which calls for the
tough teams ﬁrst.

The key to the 1952 Panthers’ future lies not in whether-
they are good enough but in whether they‘ have enough
depth to face the rough schedule.

Every position,on the line can be ﬁlled with an experi-
enced regular, but Coach Red Dawson will have to draw his
reserves from a predominantly inexperienced group. '

the regular oﬁrense by Coach Red
Dawson, after being used both of-
fensively and defensively the past
two years.

When Billy joined the varsity
in 1950, the installation of the T-.
formation ruled out his_ chance of
running-in the buck-lateral series,
a dangerous single-wing play in
which Billy specialized in high
school. i '
But Reynolds stepped right into
a regular role, not only perform-
ing as a steady ball carri_er but
starring’on defense as well. That
year he set a new Panther record
for pass interceptions with seven
for the season.

Hampered Last Year

The heavy-shouldered 22-year-
old doesn’t mind being shifted
around, "‘I’ll play anywhere the
coach tells me—offense or de-
fense.”

A pulled hip muscle hampered
Billy most of last season restrict-
ing him to defensive duties al-
most exclusively.

“I couldn’t sidestep or make any
sharp turns, and it didn’t heal

set now,” he smiles, tugging
proudly at the bunched—up muscle
protruding above" his right hip.

Another feature which stands

 

An interesting incident occured at the Ellsworth Field
proving grounds last Saturday when Coach Red Dawson
found. out who dominates the gridiron——his varsity or the
freshmen. .

The affair was centered around the‘ squad’s ﬁrst scrim-
mage session. And the result, besides the usual bumps and

low lesson for the cocky ﬁrst-
year gridders. '

It took Coach Dawson’s
varsity just one day of rug-
ged scrimmaging to end the
'  yearling’s uprising. , Before
 this, though, the frosh stole
the afternoon’s show and
opened the crowd’s eyes to

_ ' their goings—on.

_ Twenty-seven freshmen, regarded as 'Pitt’s best if not
heaviest crop ever, were eager to impress onlookers and

‘ coaches. Eleven of them answered th ﬁrst call for defensive

work with Indian screams and rebel yells. .
They stopped backs Billy Hoffman, Billy Reynolds, and

Bobby Epps often enough, too, and when the next freshman

platoon footed the line they treated their older and wiser

' mates to a similar reception.

 

It was no T party for the varsity this day.
But as one Pitt gridder remarked afterwards, “They had

their day.‘ Now they’re not so playful.” He, of course, was

referring to the ‘following scrimmage Monday afternoon
when the varsity line. “peeled them down~—o'ne by one.”
The determination and. spirit of these freshmen, how-
ever, were not any different than what’s taken place at
every initial scrimmage in the past. ,
“They’re always like that at ﬁrst,” remarked _Tony

Romantino, s_quat guard. “But the last two years these guys
. have really been tough.” Most of the other veterans echoed

these sentiments. . .

_ “I remember when I was a freshman,” Center Stu Kline
recalled, “we did the same thing against Bimbo’ (Cecconi)
and the rest of them.” '

FIRST CA.SUALT_Y of the Pitt
training sessions was a coach, not
a player. Bob Friedlund, line

coach, became overenthusiastic in
demonstrating -blocking technique
and wrecked an ankle.

They can be a source of con-

who sometimes ﬁnd. it difficult to
tell which way his legs are‘ going
—like an eggbeater,

There is no doubt, however,
which way the 1952 team is go-
ing, according to Billy, who ex-
udes optimism and praise in be-
half of his teammates.

“This is the best team I’ve play-

have the spirit.”

In the spring Billy plans to play
baseball—-he already has been

and later will probably enter the
Air Corps with a commission.
