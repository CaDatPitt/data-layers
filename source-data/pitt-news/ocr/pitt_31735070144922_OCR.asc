Greek organizations are downplaying
the ﬁnancial costs of joining their com-

munities, and for the most part, the tactic A

is 

By focusing heavily on the extracur-
ricular value that greek life can offer stu-
dents, many fraternities and sororities have
been able to keep their  levels

T stable, despite the economic downturn. T

“Millennial students are  savvy
consumers, but not natural joiners They
need to seewhafsinit for them,” 
Russell, national executive vice president
of Delta Tau Dam  .

last year, the fraternity. had 6,750

undergraduate members nationally, the

mostit’s had since 1990, and Pit1_’s chapter

boost membership, said Bob Biggs, the
national  vice president of Phi

“Showing actual leadership‘ expeii- —

ence within an oiganizationadds value
to a resume,” said Biggs ‘The amount

a lifetime experience.’ ’

Pitt defends community efforts

by Liz Navratil A
Axmiatatzt New E3it0r'

Pitt might receive more state fund-
ing—if it starts givingmore back to
the community.

Several Pennsylvania legislators
said that part of the reason they were
cutting back on Pitt’s  was be-
cause they didn’t feel the University
conuibutes enough to the surround-

ingcommuriity, Student Government _

Board President Kevin Morrison said
at a Senate Council meeting Wednes-
day. Morrison and several other stu-
dents and faculty members traveled
to Harrisburg last month for the an-
nual lobbying day.

“They were in the minority,” said

Two for  ‘ A

Morrison‘ after the meeting, ‘-‘but

‘ , someones sayingit”

So, Morrison said, the University
should be sure to address the prob-
lem. ' '

Chancellor Mark Nordenbergwas
surprised by Moriison’s statement;

‘That is _certainly not a reaction

of the conversations that I have with
people in western Pennsylvania,” he
said.

“We should debiief each other,”
he ‘told Morrison.

Paul Supowitz, Pitt’s vice chancel-
lor for governmental relations, told
the meetings attendees that Pitt still
has moral support from the state
government. .

“Don’t confuse the lack of ﬁnan-

cial support over. time for a-lack of
support for the University,” he said.

Several senate members’ laughed .

before Supowitz added that, “-If [leg-
islators] are not integrated into the
immediate region, they may not be
aware of what we do.”

Nordenberg suggested that last
week’s memorial for the city police of-
ﬁcers Paul]. Sciullo 1, Eric Kelly and
Stephen Mayhle, who died while

responding to a call for a domestic I

disturbance  Stanton Heights, could

help improve Pitt’s  -
Senate Council President Jo

Baker thanked Nordenberg for agree-

,  to host the ceremony in the Pe-

tersen Events Center. _
“We didn’t just agree,” said Nor-

   

idenbeg ‘ﬁve reached out and of-

fer ”

Thousands of police officers
from across the nation and as far
away as Canada and New Zealand at-
tended the ceremony.

Nordenberg said he received
numerous comments from people
commending the way the Pitt police
reached out to city police. He said

_ he heard multiple times that the Pitt
- police demonstrated a level of profes-

sionalism and dedication that’s hard
to find in other places

That  said, he added, “I hope
I neverwill see anythinglikeitagain,
but it was almost overwhelming to
look down into the seats and see all

the families and law enforcement of-

which Pitt must comply by May 1.

A “red flag” is a suspicious pattern,
practice or speciﬁc activity that indicates
the possible existence of identity theft,
according to an the Commission’s how-
to guide for businesses ~ S

The rules require businesses and
organizations" to implement a 
identity theft prevention program to

Colleges and universities are consid-
ered creditors, entities that regularly defer

payments for goods or services, because -

they offer student loans

Pitt  already taken steps to ensure
students’ security by  online au-
thentication and in—person identiﬁcation
for certain transactions;'s_aid University
spokesperson _]ohn.Fedele

University employees are supposed
to be on the lookout, too

“Employees are‘ trained to spot
anomalies that might indicate attempted
identity theft,” said Fedele They are in-
structed to point out potential problems
to their supervisers and, when appropri-

ate, to law enforcement authorities

Pitt already follows many of the
comrnission’s rod-flag rules because it
alreadyconrplies with the safeguarding
rules of the Gramm—Leach-Billey Act

The GLB Act, enacted in 1999, in-
cludes provisions to protect consumers’
personal ﬁnancial info°r-mation held by

ﬁnancial institutions, according to Pitt’s

Web site
However, following the GLB'Act

‘ is not enough to prevent identity theft,

said. Sai Huda, CEO of _ Compliance
Coach, a company that  risk

"The Red Flags Rules arecqmpletely -

different,” said Huda. Whereas the GLB

ust Complyivvith new

Act provides privacy for non-public in-
formation, the Red Flags -Rules require
organizations to  seek threats
against identity 

Huda said that identity thieves often

target students because “theyhave alack

of skepticism when sl1aringinﬁ)rmation”
'IheFTC’s2008crimedatareported

24 percent of the complaints against
identity theft, said Huda. - , 4
He advised students to exercise more

caution when asked for information at A

school

There areidentity theftrings around
the country that go to campuses under

rule s
said Huda They will ask for your infor-
mationinthe form of a job or creditcard
application, but'_“it’s really a sham”

I-luda also stressed that “prevention
is key’ ’ to protecting your information.

The Commission had originallyiset
the compliance date for Nov. 1, 2008, but
granted a six—month delay of enforce-
ment If organizations do not comply
with new standards. by May 1, he said
the FTC_can ﬁne them and pursue legal
action

The government currentiy has 26
risks “red—ﬂagged,” but Compliance
Coach’s software, CompliancePal, will
perform risk assessment on 35 ﬂags,

ﬁcers and mourners.”

Others at the meeting pointed out that the '
University’s relationship with the Greater Pitts-
burgh Community Food bank could also help
its reputaion. ’ ,

Ivy Ero, director of educational programs
for the food bank, said University officials could
send legislators “to the little, old lady at the food

3 bank,” referring to herself

“\V1thout you, we do not distribute monthly.
over 1.7 million pounds of groceries,” she said _

The University is one the food bank’s spon-
sors Last month, the University sent 35 to 45
students, faculty and staff to help distribute food
to people throughout the city. 0

Ero said the food bank’s donations are “in
the toilet,” so the University’s help is especially
crucial right now . .

The food bank serves more than 120,000
people each month, said Ero. _

“Our customers look just like you and 1,” she
added “They just don’t make enough money to
support their needs” .

Ero, said every little bit of money that the Uni-
versity and its student groups contributed to the
food bank helps Evenif theycan only a few
thousand dollars, she said, that’s enough to help

— . tell the bank’s patrons that they’re not alone

So, she said, “To our legislators in Harrisburg,

I say, ‘Ha”’ ‘

Propo.sali/sljlould prevail i

over private lenders‘

Many students seem to take their

= student loans for granted The preva- _

lence of the student loan industry in
the United States is almost unmatched
in its ubiquity — if you’re attending

college or graduate school in the Unit- ~ .

ed States, it’s basically assumed that

I v loans help  atleast some of your

educational expenses Whether they’re

 federally subsidized Stafford loans or
 private transactions with small banks,
E student loans are a neaﬂy uniform

aspect of the college experience.
So the thought that there is a ma-

 jor storm brewing over-the future of

3 governrnent-subsidized lending in

the United States might come as a
surprise But under President Barack

- Obama’s new education agenda, sub-

sidized student loans currently run
through private lenders, such as Sallie
P Morgan Chase and Citibank,
would be replaced with an expanded
program of direct government lend-
ing, cutting out the middleman and

 offering savings to both students and

unqmwns

Under the current system, the
government backs and subsidizes
the vast majority of education—related
private loans And, although this sub-

I sidy guarantees low interest rates for

students, it also pays into the proﬁts
of the companies offering the loans,
effectively allowing them to loan out
huge amounts of money and collect
guaranteed interest at almost no risk.

The new system would simply by-

 pass private lenders and  money
 directly to students and would use

3 the savings from the interest pay-

ments—estirnatedtobeashighas

 $94 billion over 10 years —— tomake
 the ‘ﬁnancing of Pell grants manda-

 tory and-to expand the program to .

 ‘more students

 Unsurprisingly, the private lending

  

corporations are up in arms against  ’

the proposal, saying that it would put .
people out of work and sound the

death knell for their business model. i ‘

But really, why should we as stu— ;

identsandtaxpayersbeforcedtopay

more forourloansinordertokeepan '
inefﬁcient industry aﬂoat, only to pay 3
the government  for the same 
reason when tax time rolls around ;
CVCYY Yea‘? - . j
. The fact these jobs are built on 3
an outdated business model that the ‘
bankers don’t want tochange because 
it’s proﬁtable is no reason to preserve 1
that model and force people to keep 5
paying for it. _ 
Andit’s hardto argueagainstthe;
merits of  the Pell grant 
program, which is the lifeblood of 
many a college student’s ﬁnances E
Expandingthesegrantswouldgivea
larger percentage of the population 
the option to pursue higher education 3
when previously people were either 
unable to  or couldn’t get a piece 5
of an alreadytoo-small pie. 
Private lending institutions obvi— -E
ouslyhave‘avestedinterestinkeep-
ing their business models alive, even ;
thbugh they are suited to an outdated- :
era of lending in which the govern- ,
ment did not have to guarantee the Q

, repaymentofeverypennybecauseof 

economic collapse and the ever—rising 3
costs of a college education. 
We hope that Obama’s plan is al- i
lowed to stand and thatitcan ﬁnance 
the next generation of -students ef- :
fectively and fairly. It might smack of 
big government or harmful business

Heinz Chapel
Free to the public

'_For as long as Heinz Chapel
has gallantly stood in the shadows

of the Cathedral, there have been ‘

talented students singing inside its

0 gothic corridor.

This year marks the 70th anni-
versary of the Heinz Chapel Choir,
Pitt’s mixed a cappella choir.

A weekend-long alumni celebra-
tion  honor the event and will
conclude with the annual spring con-
cert on Sunday at 3 p.m. in Heinz
Chapel. The event is free and open
to the public.

After the students- ﬁnish their
ﬁnals, the group will take a 16-hour
ﬂight to China for its triennial tour,
where the choir will perform four
concerts all over the country in a
two—week span. 4

The program that director John

— Goldsmith assembled features seven

different languages (including Man-

darin Chinese) and three songs with-
out real words. As per tradition, the
choir will also send off its seniors by

' "singing “Brother _]ames’s Air.” _

“To honor our alumni, we will

invite them to sing that song with .

us to give our seniors the proper
send—off,” said Goldsmith. .

The choir currently has more

than 1,000 alumni scattered around‘

the world, hundreds of whom will

"return to Oakland this weekend for a

reunion on Friday and a sing-a'—long
on Saturday. 

Goldsmith has directed the choir
since 1989, and he directed the 60th
anniversary as well. He knows the
tradition of the choir and is honored
to be hosting the alumni. '

V “I’m just proud,3’- he said. “The
alumni are really pleased with the way
the choir has been singing.” C ,

V Goldsmith doesn’t feel any added

pressure directing this eventfor all

the notable alumni. He doesn’t be-
lieve the choir does, either. .

“They’re probably more nervous
because their -family’s there than per-
forming in front of the alumni,” he
said. . - .

As they  to perform, their actions unin-

hibited by lines, plans or preconceptions, it  '
becomes apparent that the Pittsburgh Playback-

Theatre  not your average dramatic ensemble
The play,“Dissolve, Resolve Involve,”asnamed

by the groups founder, Roni Ostfield, intends to

be much more  enttrtainment—itis a call

“W/ewantto stress thatitis importanttao dissolve

change,” said Ostﬁeld, who has directed the groups *

~ since 1986. _
“Iwould saythe show evokes [President] Batack
Obarna’s message of change,” said Rich Keitel, ac-
. tor and director forthe Playbadélheatre “It’s easy
to saychange,buthowcanweactuallyachieveit?’_’
As the show approaches, the oompanyfs actors
are not re-reading scripts or memoiizinglines, 
because for Playback Theatre, there are none .

Ostﬁeld said that she typically starts out each
show by  for volunteers from the audience

‘ to shout outa feeling they are  or even

comeup on stage to shareastoryabouttheirlives
“We listen to peoples’ stories and literally play
them back ir1 order to let them feel understood.
And because the rest of the audimee then 
thatpersonwho sharedgets tofeellike,‘Ohthey
understand n1y,story, too,’’’ said Marsh.
Keitel added that he hopes people come away

- from the Playback Theatre’s show feeling a little

more empathetic toward one another.

“It’susuallyafterl1agedythatpeople feelthis _

type of connection, then everyone goes back to

Though the shows are certainly spontaneous,
there is typically a loose stmcture that each’perfor—
 follows,  to Marsh.

“Usuallywe start off with some of our shorter

the tour was the most fun. g .
i “We ended in Rio de Janeiro, and you can
imagine the kind of fun we had on the beaches
t of Ipanema,” said Green. “That’s a place where
people party from 10 p.m_. until 6 a_.m.”
For the 2009 tour, in addition to perform-
ing in Beijing, Xian, Hangzhou, and Shanghai,

_ the group will also visit'Suzh0u and Hong »

Kong. - . - e
“Our'iti_nerary is completely booked every
day,” said l\/leese. “It seems like it’s "going to be
anon-stop trip.” ..
I Goldsmith said he always has the choir
perform at least one song in the native language
I of the country they are visiting. But this year,
for the ﬁrst time, he.had a Chinese grad student

coach the choir on the dictation of “Fengyang

Song,” which will be performed this‘Sunday
and on the tour. ’

“We always get standing ovations,” he said.
“The foreign audiences are extremely recep—
tive.” .

_ This isn’t the ﬁrst time Goldsmith tried
to go to China, though. In 2003, the trip
was booked, but the SARS epidemic foiled
the choifsplans. Miraculously, -travel agency
Kingsway International rerouted the tour to
Scandinavia on 30 days notice. Goldsmith was
so grateful that hestill uses its services. ' if

A ISTINGUISHED CAREE CAN

Green doesn’t know any Mandarin other -

, thani“Fengyang Song,” but he is still looking

forward to the trip. - _.

Now that -he is older, he views this tour
differently than his first one.

' f‘There’s thousands of years of culture
there that is so vastly different than oui:$,”
he said.

During his first tour, Green was more ex-
cited about the ‘fact that he just’ ﬁnished up
his freshman year and was going to countries
where he could get into bars. But he’s more
excited for the sightseeing than the partying
this time around. , g '

“The Great Wall of China is one of those
things you’ll probably only see once in your
lifetime,” he said. “You can see the inside of
a bar plenty of times.”

This Sunday, Green and the rest of the
seniors will perform in Heinz Chapel for the
final time. ‘

All of the chapel’s history and architectural

' beauty will surround them as they perform 16

songs from all around the world.
, Goldsmith said that anybody who has never
been inside the Chapel will be in awe, especially
during the ‘concert. '
_ “It’s an inspiring place,” he said.

J unior-college recruits thriving for Pitt

r I  J

by Greg Trietley
Staﬂ’ Writer

Though recruiting high school.

players is the norm in college baseball,
many programs look to junior colleges,
two—year post—secondary schools, to
ﬁnd baseball talent;

‘ ‘If you look at any successful base-
ball program, you will see two to four
junior—college players on their roster
each year,’ ’ said Pitt baseball coachjoe
Jordano.

And _]ordano’s Panthers know all
about junior colleges Seven members
of Pitt baseball hail from them —— in-
cluding ﬁve transfers this year.

‘junior—college recruiting in base— ‘

ball is very common,” said Jordano.
“If a program can ﬁnd the right type
of player that ﬁts academically and
athletically, it can be a big boost for
the program.”

One such player for Pitt is second

— baseman Chris Sedon, who leads the

team in neady early offensive category.
Sedon is one of two Panthers to start
every game this season.

“Chiis is doing a great job for us,”
said Jordano.

_ , Chris Nevemtan / Staff Photographer-
Pitt junior Nathan Hood has both pitched and played the ﬁeld.

In addition to Sedon, inﬁelder
Frank Mercuiio, catcher Cory Brown-
sten and inﬁelder/ pitcher Nathan

, Hood have all performed admirably

in their ﬁrst seasons out of junior col-
lege, said Jordano.

Mercurio and Brownsten both
have four home runs this season, tied

athletes. 
“Coach [Chris Pensak of Lack-

awanna Community College] does a '

great job,” saidjordano. “He prepares
his players well for competing at the
next level. For the most part, his kids
do well in the classroom, as well. He
has a solid reputation for producing

    

 

careers at  Community

Pitt senior Conredge Collins is rated as a top-ﬁve fullback by many NFL Draft scouts.

NFL Draft

if ichael Heaterl Photo Editor

Collins hopes to fill many 
roles as NFL running back

by Kyle Craig
Staﬁ’ W/riter -

A For three seasons, Conredge Collins did the
dirty work for the Pitt offense at ‘the fullback‘
position. In less than two weeks during the NFL
Draft, Collins hopes that work will pay off.

While his large build and powerful running ‘
style are ideal for a fullback, his shiftiness and
lateral movement make him a noteworthy threat
in the open ﬁeld. His physical tools, along with
his experience, have scouts projecting Collins
as a NFL—caliber player.

Multiple talent evaluation Web sites and
ESPN’s Mel Kiperjr. list the 6—foot, 230-pound
back among the top ﬁve fullbacks available to be
drafted. However, Collins knows that nothing is

guaranteed, so he’s  to keep a level head.

“It’s something you can’t expect. I think that
you can get too wound up if you try to think
about it because you usually don’t know until
that day,” said Collins in regards to being drafted.
“You’ve got a lot of people  you, but you
really don’t know until everyone else knows.”
. Last season, Collins carried the ball 21 
and made nine receptions out of the backﬁeld.
His career statistics of .335  yards and 37
receptions weren’t overwhelming, but his value
to his team was unquestionable

In numerous ‘situations, Collins was called
upon to make crucial lead blocks and  tough
yardage in between the tackles Despite not hav-
ing a collection of long “highlight-reel” run_s on

never hesitated to play freshmen early in their

careers.” _ H V
High school players still head the recruiting
season, though, with top performers Danny

Lopez, Joe Leonard and Nate Reed serving as‘

prime examples. . .-
“The majority of the players we recruit during

a common year will -be  school players,” said,
']ordano. “But if we have a speciﬁc need, we will

“It is important to be certain during the re-
 process that we identify players that will

achieving in the classroom,” said Jordano. “We

, have a very high rate of graduation for our junior-

college players”
Pitt baseball does not receive a full allotment
of scholarships, said Jordano, so continuing to

a grab transfers is vital.

“We will need to continue recruiting quality
junior—college players,” said]ordano. “We do not

Wannistedtis teaching and influence helps Collins

Collins, page 15
his resume, Collins has proven to be

‘ a"reliable component of a pro-style
offense. '

After getting the opportunity to

carry the ball out of some single-
back formations this season, Collins
feels he’s distinguished himself from
 backs that also entered this
year’s Draft.

“I got to show my versatility this
year, so, that’s always a plus,” said Col-
lins. “I think I should stand out a little

‘ bit more than other guys.”

One attribute that Collins believes
he’s shown throughout his college
career is his ability to ﬁll multiple roles
in the backﬁeld. .

“I can play running back, catch
the ball out in the ‘flat as a fullback and

make key blocks for [another] back i

when I need to,” said Collins. .
On the next level, Collins also

hopes to get an opportunity to be_

utilized more as a feature back How-

ever, regardless of the number of .

carries he gets, Collins said that he’s
content as long as he’s helping his
team be successful. i

Having a head coach like Dave

been an asset to Collins. \Y/annstedt’s

Collins knows who has spent time in
the NFL Collins’ father, Tony Collins,

is a former" Pro Bowl running back

who spent six seasons with the New
England Patriots and one ﬁnal year

. with the lVIiarni Dolphins.

For Collins, his father’s last profes-
sional destination would be an ideal
place for ﬁrst NFL job. It would be an

appropriate and welcome homecom-

ing for the Miami, Fla., native
“I would love_ to play for the D01-
phins and get to go back home for a

_little while,” said the Monsignor Pace

High School graduate. -

If not Miami, Collins would like it. ~

go to a place where the temperature is
a little higher and the weather a good

deal less inclement;

“I just want to go somewhere
where ‘it’s a nice city and it’s not too
cold because [the weather] has been
kind of rough up here for me the past
few years,” said Collins. ,

Regardless of the climate, Collins
will attempt to make the most of his
opportunity at his next destination.

And once he’s in camp, Collins is liable,

to make plays regardless of whether.
or not the ball is in his hands.
