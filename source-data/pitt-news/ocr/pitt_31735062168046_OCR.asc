Program

Initiated

F or Freshman Class

“The Program“ is coming.

At a meeting this Thursday at
6:30 pm. on the 12th floor of the
Cathedral the new association for
freshman will be initiated.

Chairman of the steering com-
mittee for "The Program."Gerry
Woods. explained that the new
program was being formed as an
alternative to many of the groups
entering freshman are usually
drawn into.

“Freshman enter college and
quickly get drawn into this polar-
ized structure,” Miss Woods said.
She enumerated some of the
groups that freshman try to get
into including: fraternitys and so-
roritys, dorm crowds, commuter
groups, AWS, engineering organ-
izations .and tightly segregated
black and white crowds.

"What usually happens." she
went on. "is that the individual re-
mains with his own little segre-
gated crowd for most of his four
years. She emphasized that the
lines of communication. iiitra-
group or sect-wise. were usually
polarized.

Miss Woods continued saying
that this polarity was the direct
cause of the unware students cre-
ation. "Colleges should be the
place where a maximum degree

of human interaction and com-
munications takes place." she
said.

Miss‘ Woods explained that “The

verse this dilemma, “that is,” she
said,’ “to get the radical freshman
in contact with the socially un-
aware and disinterested; to get
the white student who never spoke
to or touched a black person to do
so; and to just in general, get all
different kinds of people aware of
each other.”

She said that only good could
come from communications and
that our society must first be-
come aware. then learn to respect
and then start to have meaningful
communications.

It was explained that the pur-
pose of the Thursday meetings
was to further introduce the con-
cept of "The Program" and an-
swer any questions about it: to
find actively involved in some of
the existing programs of the pro-
ject.

Miss Woods stated that the func-
tion of upperclass students in the
coed groups (of about ten fresh-
men) , would be to act as a catalyst
for any kind of interaction be-
tween group members.

She aded that there might be‘ a
two to three day summer camp
for the estimated 200 upperclass-
men who expect to show up at the
Thursday meeting.

"We want to cut off any persons a

who only look at this program. or
would go into it only as a means of
rushing prospective fraternity and
sorority candidates.“ Miss Woods
concluded. .

DR. JEROME L. ROSENBERG has been named Dean of the University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Chancellor

Wesley W. Posvar announced last week. Dr. Rosenberg, who has served as acting dean of that faculty since last
October, previously served as chairman of the Department of Biophysics and Microbiology.

A search committee appointed last June to look for a permanent Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
concurred in Dean Rosenberg’s appointment, which went'into effect yesterday. The deanship had been filled in
an acting capacity by Dr. J. Steele Gow, Jr., associate provost for Instructional Experimentation, since the resig-
nation last spring of Dr. David Halliday.

Dean Rosenberg has been a member of Pitt's natural science faculty since I953. A graduate of Dickinson
College with advanced degrees from Columbia, he is a specialist in the chemistry of light and has authored books
and numerous articles in that field. His- previous teaching appointments were at Columbia, the University of Chi-
cago and the University of Minnesota. i

He currently is serving a three-year term on the National Council of the American Association of University.
Professors. He was elected president of the University Senate last September, a position from which he resigned

Science Program

Better

The L-'niversity. under the aus-
pices of the National. Science
Foundation. has developed a pro-
gram to develop better-prepared
high school physics. chemistry
and mathematics teachers. It is a
joint effort of the College of Arts
and Sciences (CASI and the School
of Education and is scheduled to
go into effect in the fall of 1970.

Dr. T. H. Dunkelberger. asso-
ciate dean of the CAS and director
of the program stated. "Although
the supply of teachers in many
subjects is reaching the saturation
level. there are still positions
available in the sciences. Unfor-
tunately. many of them have to be
filled by teachers with inadequate
preparation in their field. This re-
sults in inadequately prepared
students who." he went on. "all
too often lose interest in the sci-
ences or become academic cas-
ualties when exposed to demand-
ing college courses. The cost in
both student time and trauma is
one we believe can be greatly re-
duced.'—'

Following basic preparation in
CAS, a student transfers to the
School of Education and after a to-
tal of five years from the time he
entered as a freshman, he
emerges with two degrees, a

Bachelor of Education and a Mas-
ter of Science in Education, plus
Pennsylvania certification to
teach physics and chemistry or
physics and mathematics.

A limited number of students

  Teachers Goal

~ are being accepted for September

of this year for the program's
first trial run. These students will
be entering as juniors and are ex-
pected to ready to teach in 1972
or 1973.

i-. Were John Kennedy alive, he
-» might not mention any members

in a revised edition of Profiles in
_ Courage. But, after months of de-
j plorable indecision, some General
Assemblymen did in fact behave
Thursday ina manner suggesting
the same courageous spirit which
set Thomas Hart Benton and
George Norris apart from other
men.

To be sure, heroism was not
rife in Harrisburg last week.
Many "legislators could not keep
visions of defeat in November out
of their minds. Many simply could
not muster what it took to walk
 '. voluntarily to the guillotine.

V ’ ary men. Others, aware of the un-
popularity of all the choices be-
fore them, nevertheless made the
decision their consciences told
thefn to make, placing principle
‘ over self-interest as they did.

POLITICS is aesthetically dis-
concerting. It is an imperfect sci-
ence, with no absolutes. But is is
extraordinarily realistic. It re-

right. Oh hell, yes it is. Yes it is.

sembles life itself. which is no
purer. It deals with the affairs of
men in an appropriately falliable

.way.~matching the crests and

troughts of human existence with
ones of its own.

If politics is a dirty business.
that is only because life is too.
Politicians can hardly be blamed
for acting imperfectly in an im-
perfect world. Rather. they should
be praised for coming to grips
with grim. but immutable real-
ities. _

The true politicians in the Gen-
eral Assembly were not those _who
threw up their hands in despair.
labeling every alternative unpala-
table. Nor were they those who
refused to stoop to compromise
and practice the art of the possi-
ble.

THEY WERE realists who rec-
ognized the folly of the past 13
months. attempted to cope‘with a
nearly unmanageable present. and

finally looked forward to the fu-«
ture knowing that they had at

least done their best.

He even orders me to open my trunk: inspects my spare tire.

"What did I do?" He doesn't an
swer. “Look. man." I say. "I want to know what I did." It takes

Why me? According to the state policeman he stops all old cars
because it's often the old cars. not fit for safe driving. that cause
the accidents on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. And my car was old.
and besides my back tires looked worn. But how could he have seen
my back tires from a few feet in front of my car and from within the
toll booth, no less. which is metal on the lower half?

NO, THAT couldn't have been Officer Kucharik's reason. So.
OK, now let's see. He doesn't like me. Well. maybe he figures that ‘

me. My hair isn't long enough in the front to get in my eyes. \

DIG IT. I know. Long hair means extra weight on the head. Ex-

tra weight on the head means extra-big headache. -And naturally. ex-
: tra-big headache means inability to concentrate on the road. Uh. uh.

Officer Kucharik. I give up. Tell me. 'Cause I'm gettin' sick and

it needs by passing an appropria-

package deserve something bet-
ter than the indifference of most
students and. incredibly enough.
the contempt of a few others.

They merit a hearty thank-you
from all students and the particu-
lar gratitude of those who would
have been obliged to leave Pitt had
the General Assembly acted
otherwise.

STUDENTS have sniped indis-
criminately at public officials for
far too long. They must learn to
distinguish between those who
take their responsibilities serious-
ly and those who think only of
themselves.

It may be in vogue to castigate
all politicians and sneer at poli-
tics itself. But is it possible that
those who take potshots at every-
one and everything do so because
they are personally unable to sep-
arate the good from the bad. to
distinguish between those things
which are worth preserving and
those which are not. to draw a line
between those politicians who
should stay and those who should
not?

In an-attempt to make such a
distinction. I publicly thank the
State Legislature's leaders and all
General Assemblymen who voted
to provide Pitt with the funds it
needs. on behalf of those students
who feel the same way and those
who ought to know better.

The Syste

by FRANK DONATELLI
Contributing Writer

With the increase of campus
violence during the past several
years. the New Left has been the
subject of much controversy. At
present. most of the debate has
centered around the tactics of the
New Left. and rightly so. The
beating up of opposing students.
the kidnapping of deans. the des-
truction of property-—all these tac-
tics have been denounced by the
New Left‘s opponents.

However. while granting the ne-
cessity of condemning their Ges-
tapo-like tactics. one should not
fail to criticize their doctrinealso.
That is. leaving tactics aside _t'or
a moment. the goals of the New
Left are just as repulisve as the
means used to attain them. In-
deed. the reason that the New
Left's tactics are so violent is
precisely because their goals are
so ridiculous. They resort to work-
ing outside the system because
they could never get a majority
of the American people to suppor
them. -

 

Consider for a moment Bob

Ging's article. "Alternatives'?'."."'
in the Feb. 27 issue of The Pitt
News. You hear the usual cluck-
clucking about eliminating the
system all right. Like so many
other radicals. _Mr. Ging fails to‘
distinguish between the right to
be heard and the right to be listen-
ed to. Just because Mr. Ging has
the right to advocate x doesn't
mean that he has the right to have
x implemented.

IF MR. Ging fails to get x adopt-
ed. it is not becuase the system is
rotten. but because the people
don't want what he is proposing.
Using Mr. Ging's line of reason-
ing. Republicans who supported

Letter To Irate Reader

A N on-Rebuttal  

by VIRGINIA ‘JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Dear Reader:

Received your comment on the
28th concerning my column liken-
ing the Chicago Conspiracy trial
to a zoo and Federal Judge Julius
Hoffman to Chief Kangaroo.

Now I expected that not a few
readers would understand and
or agree with my attack on the le-
gitimacy of the judicial system in
this country and buy the tenor of
my arguments. Granted. the ana-
logy of the "marshmallow riot"
provoked by Senator Strom Thur-
mond at C-MU last month may
have been absurd: it was meant
to be.

However. I am not interested in
defending my ideas at this time.
but rather my ‘right to know why
you disagree with tthem and who
you are.

Your insertion of my article in
an unmarked envelope with an un-
signed comment sprawled'(hasti-
l_\'l across it was"u‘nsatisfactor_v to
one who has spent. thought. feel-
ing and time on the text.

Perhaps. you considered my
analysis "rot"-éand "juvenile shit"
(a loose translation of the Latin
original»; perhaps it didn't jive
with your loyalties. Perhaps. you
are right; I have no way of know-

ing. But your intellectual integri-
ty or rather lack of it is not so
clouded.

Dave Dellinger. Abbie Hoffman
and the others in Chicago were
willing to stand behind their be-
liefs and on the basis of those be-
liefs. they are now facing lengthy
jail terms. *

Others have been burned at the
stake. dispossessed and exiled be-
cause of their integrity: I promise
no such penalties.

~ The kind of hit and run criticism
reflected in your comments re-
minds me of the type of person
who walks away from you. shak-
ing his head when you're despar-
ately trying to make him under-
stand.

It reminds me of the person
who sits in front of his TV set and
makes judgments on the "nig-
gers" and the “commie" students
and shuts off his mind when he
shuts off the set.

It's possible that you didn't '

think that my ideas were worth
the time to rebut. Then they were-
n't worth the six cent stamp on
the envelope or the effort it took
to cut out the column.

But I believe that I‘ have the
rightas a person to judge the
worth of yours.

Or Not   ToBe

his ilk resorted to working out-
side the system? I submit that the
reason is to be found in the sub-

, stance of their complaints. which.

like their tactics. are nonsense.
Some examples: ‘

Ging: “. . . our ‘government, city,
state, federal levels included, does-
n’t seem to give a damn about the
welfare of its people.”

I would suggest that Mr. Ging

take a look at an excellentreport
just issued by the American Con-

servative Union concerning Pres- _

ident Nixon's recent welfare pro-
posals. “Solution or Socialism"
lists current local. state. and fed-
eral expenditures on welfare and
health alone at over $72 billion.
Seventy-two billion dollars. Mr.
Ging. That's three times as much
as we spend in Vietnam.

Now it could be argued with
much justification. as I would ar-

gue. that of the $72 billion. much

is wasted and misued. and that the
real answer to the eliminating of
poverty is less government and
more capitalism. Criticizing the
efforts of a program. however. is
very different from lumping gov-
ernments as diverse as the city
council of Selma to the state gov-

. ernment of California into a nice.

neat “don't give a dam" category.

‘Ging: “. . . a system that puts

ABM missiles and space programs, .

into its budget while people con-
tinue to starve."

ALONGSIDE the $72 billion we
spend on welfare. approximately
$4.8 billion is advocated annually
for the space program and an even
less amount has been appropri-
ated for ABM research and the in-

stallation of two missile sites. If.

people do indeed starve (Mayor
Lindsay will tell you otherwise»
while we spend $72 billion annual-
'ly. why would Mr. Ging think the

_. situation, could be improved by
-spending $7 billion more‘?

  

  
  
  
     
 

  
  

use of the resources already en-

gaged inthe fight against poverty. .

One would also hope that it is here
the youth and student energy can
best be used: in the development
of imaginative and private solu-

.tions to our nation's social ills.

But the best.«Mr. Ging and his
friends can do is rant and rave
about the '«'system. "

Ging: “. . . a system that permits
men like Judge Hoffman who jail
people for political reasons . . .”

Whatever one thinks of individ-
ual rulings by the judge’. the fact
remains that the seven defendants
turned a court of law into a cir-
cus. They weren't interested in
justice: indeed they didn't even
recognize the legitimacy of the
proceedings. Whether or not they

_ were guilty of violating the 1968

anti-riot law was up to the jury.
not Judge Hoffman.’ .

BUT REALLY, Mr. Ging. call-
ing the judge a "pig." constantly
disrupting court proceedings.
turning the ‘trial into a judicial
farce. these are "political" ac-
tions? Most people ‘would call
them lawless acts and as «such
nunishable according to the law.

What emerges from writers
such as Mr_. Ging is _a character-
istic c6"mmon to fever swamp
movements (whether of the left or
right». namely. you can always
find the villain. The villain is cap-

. italism. or Zionism. or the Penta-

gon. or the international bankers.
or the system’.

But. in reality. things are more
complicated than that. especially
in _a society as diverse as ours.
The first prerequisite in getting
anything done is to recognize this
fact. Anyone can place a number
of widely diverse groups into a

Editor. The Pitt News:

This is a response to Allan Se-

23. 1970. a letter which. unfortu-

Look at your University popula-

students are sons and daughters
of those steel workers. students
who are here courtesy of state
subsidies in the form of tuition
cuts and scholarships.

But the most sickening "part"
of Mr. Senio‘s letter is his con-
stant reference to the University
as a "breeding ground for Marx-
ist revolution." and as a place
where "decent young men" are
perverted by poisonous commun-
ist propoganda.

What are you doing at this Uni--
versity. Mr. Senio? You sure as
"Christ aren‘t learning anything.
Education has certainly failed to
"make men good." but to bastard-
ize the entire process by manifest-

me control of one generation of a

gymnasts finished the season in
splendid fashion by trouncing the
Syracuse Orangemen 128.40-121.20
Saturday at Trees Hall.

Lowell Meek. an outstanding

this one since the Kent State meet.
We weren‘t going to let this one
slip by us. ‘
"Everybody just pulled it to-

‘ gether today." He added that the

Orangemen helped thier winning
cause by choking on many events.
He said. "Most of the Syracuse
guys were choking. especially on
the parallel bars and the high bar.
I think it would have been closer
