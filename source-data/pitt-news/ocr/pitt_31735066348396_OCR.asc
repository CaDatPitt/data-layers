Curtiss Porter confirmed his
appointment to the Black Studies
chair last night, but University\
officials who are responsible for
 making the decision continued
‘L’ ’:”‘their silence.
Porter - said the appointment
becomes effective when he receives
a letter' from FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg spelling out the terms of
the agreement. Rosenberg prom-
ised at a meeting ‘Friday’ to sent
Porter the letter, Porter said.
But Rosenberg, who said Thurs-

Three Begin Harrisburg Study

“"l/ote in 86 Elections.-"

Students Tell Why (not)

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

Student who voted in last week’s
SGB elections gave more- reasons
for having cast their ballot than
those who didn't vote gave for not
voting. The _nonvoters generally
felt they weren't knowledgeable

3; enough about the candidates to
"‘~ make wise voting decisions.

Ron Placone, who didn’t vote,
said, “I didn’t know any of the
candidates. I figured I’d let
somebody who knew the candi-
dates make the choice. I don’t care
who won because I don’t think it
makes any difference. In fact, I
think they should abolish it, be-
cause I think some of the people on
it try to cater to the interests that
elected them, and the administra-
tion is better able to allocate the
money more fairly without them.”

Another student who didn’t vote
also said she knew too little about T,

Q‘-zhe candidates to make the proper

. choice. She added’, “Why vote for

someone who you don't know much
about?" “ A, ' 

Two students who declined to cast
their ballots specified their reasons"

for ‘being unfamiliar with /the
9;.§$Piran_t_é»-;'i0ii¢< S't!id'{'he-:'W5s “-f‘*i “ ’

 

     

boggeddown this year to find out
about the candidates.” A

Jim Garver said, “I haven't been

in the area in the past six months
A and didn’t make the effort to
tamiliarize myself.-"

Those who cast their vote did so
either for the sense of involvement
it gave them or because they

‘wished to change things they were
dissatisfied with. 1

Among those who voted for the‘

sake of involvement" was Chuck
Krepley. He felt it was, “more or
less a chance to participate in 'the
student governmental process.”
Mark Karscig said voting in the
SUB elections was for him “the
iirst step in getting involved."
One student said he felt voting
was important because “without it,
the Pitt student wouldn’t have a
voice.“ He added.his own reason
tor voting was "I thought you need
to vote to express yourself."
Uthers voted more specifically out
of discontentment. Alan Kapp,
treasurer for the Pitt chapter of the
American. Chemical ‘Society (ACA),
said, “If I havevsomething to gripe

son  Jeffrey Leber, received

tentative confirmation but turned’

down the program offer. Nelson, a
‘senior, took a leave of absence from
Pitt because of a broken ankle.
Leber’s comfirmation came late in
December, and the agency, place-
ment was unsuitable. “They (the
Harrisburg ofﬁcials) didn’t tell us
which agencies had » openings,”
Leber said.‘ “They wanted to place
me on boards that I wasn’t. qualif-
ied for. The program i wouldn’t
have done me any good if I did it
that way.” ' I
The State Government Internship

. Program combines academic study

with work in governmental agenc-
ies. Participants receive academic
credit from Pitt for the term after
completing an observation log and
agency assignments.

Topper, a senior majoring in
urban studies and political science,
was placed in the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance A-
gency. She requested placement in

,the Department of Community

Affairs, which would have allowed
her to “integrate my experience in
public administration with the
things I’ve learned in class.”

Epperson will work in the Depart-
ment of Property and Supplies.
Her request for the Department of
Education was considered by the
Harrisburg officials, but no open-
ings were available. Epperson is a
French, Chinese, and Women’s
Studies major. Shaiman, a junior,
was placed in the Department of
Transportation.

A The campus coordinator for Pitt’s

intern program, Gretchen Pfadt,
expressed regret over Leber’s and
Nelson’s situations, but was sur-
prised by the confirmation of all
five applicants. “The people who

weren’t selected have priority over

new applicants for next _ term’s
intership,” Pfadt said. “We have
their names and if they want to
re-apply they; ’won’t havejto go

 

gain.” v

Only eight applicants in ‘addition

to the five finalists,particpated in
the intern program. Pfadt attribut-
ed the low number to lack of prior
advertising. “We didn’t_have time

to let people in on this because we I

found out about it rather late,” she
said. “This year we’ll start
recruiting earlier, probably in late
January, because the deadline is in
March."

“Last time~we’ve given informa-
tionito all departments and‘advi-
sors to make the program more
widely known,” she explained.

The selection relies upon inter-
views and written applications.
"The essay is the most important
part.

Wherever It leads A

NEW YORK AP--Vice President 1 '
Nelson A. Rockefeller said Sunday , Wg-r‘
the investigation of. domestic "
spying by the CIA is going to be
pursued wherever it leads. “to a
Republican president, to a Demo-
cratic president, or anyone else.”

“We’re going to get the facts and
get them out to the public,” be told
reporters as he left a CBS studio
where he had appeared on his first

- nationwide television interview

show since becoming vice presi-
dent. ‘

Rockefeller was friendly and jovial
with reporters who buttonholed
him in the studio lobby.

But ' on the show “Face ‘the
Nation” he became angered when
a reporter asked if he would
“finger” anyone since “you had
some sort of a connection with the
CIA yourself and so did Secretary
of '-State Kissinger you gave a
$50,000 gift to.”

Henry Kissinger, as head of the
National Security Council, has
close dealings with the CIA and
Rockefeller was a member of the
Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board which oversees it. Kissinger '
was a Rockefeller aide in the
1960’s.

The vice president, visibly angry,
snapped: ‘‘In your question, you

«.:

question my integrity, if you’li\

excuse me for saying so I took an
oath of office. When Itake an oath,

_ I carry out that oath.

“There is no conflict asfar as I am
concerned. Wherever the facts
lead us we will go and yo/u canbe

Anotherstudent responded his

-reason for voting was “hope for

change," adding, “Student Go-

' ' A few of those who were queried

gave somewhat different reasons

for voting than the mere common

motives of dissatisfaction or desire
for involvement. One said he
voted, although unfamiliar with the
candidates, because a friend of his
recommended ‘a candidate to him.
Another said she voted “out of
habit."

One student who voted said she
did, “Because I don’t know "how
much of a difference it’s going to
make, but then you can’t complain
about things if you haven’t voted.”

Eﬂient Elections

Once the winners are announced in the Student Govermnent (SG)
‘ elections, the SG Elections Committee, (SGEC), who is responsible for
5 the effective supervision and regulation of the elections, is put to sleep
never to wake until next November. And then the committee is
' pressured by an impending election deadline to complete signiﬁcant
 work, including the writing of an election code-

The code is ﬂawed and the reasons are quite understandable. An
elections committee appointed in October or November simply does not
have adequate time to put together a foolproof code. Not only are they
under extreme pressure, but the committee also has little time in which
to seek opinion relative to the code’s contents.

Commenting on

    ROTC Letters

‘Dear Editor:
We would like to comment upon *
‘the series of letters that appeared

in the Pitt News discussing the
merits of the ROTC program.

A Mr. O'Brien was criticized for
his unfamiliarity with the contents

' of an ROTC course in relation to his

evaluation of the program. One of
the concerned, Daniel Cronin,
audited an advanced level ROTC

course, Military Science 116, as

taught by Major Dean during the
winter term [74].

The ﬁrst lecture attended by Dan
was entitled, “How to Make a
Decision.” The title was indicative
of the course content. He described’
the course, at best, as a practical
variation of Psychology 80, com-
bined with hints on military
courtesy and preparation for
summer camp.

This ‘Advanced’ ROTC course
was clearly outside of the liberal
arts tradition. It is a program which
gaverpractical training in a specific
field in much the same manner as a
medical school offers training in

-practical techniques of science as

related to the health of the human
being. The prospective doctor is
first given a humanistic liberal arts

_- education to insure a knowledge of
his culture and society.

Many
professions stand in much the same

if “ 1- ‘relation to the liberal arts, law,

However, there is a moral
question that arises in allowing
even the presence of ROTC on the
grounds of an institution of higher
learning. It is quite evident in
consideration of the recent events
at the United Nations that instead
of being the world’s policeman the
United States has been the world’s
assailant. The US military helps to
promote the continued existence of
brutal dictatorships as well as US
political and economic domination
of countries in Asia, Africa and
Latin America. Our military leaders
have recently raised the spectra of
outspoken racism at home.

And educational‘ institution ‘that
wishes to preserve even the
semblance of maintaining a hu-
manistic tradition cannot tolerate
an arm of the military as a part of
its educational system.

We feel it heartening that a group
of young socialists in their Student
Government campaign are against
ROTC, creditation and in favor of
increased student aid. The propos-
als, if implemented, will remove
both the incentive and means for
the moral prostitution of both the
individual . and the University.
These young socialists, who in this
campaign are at the front in the
struggle for human values, provide
for all an opportunity for expres-
sing dissent against social injus-
tice. _ M

nursing, and engineering -- all are *

contained" in separate schools in the
University. Therefore, a separate
School of Military Science, which

‘ v specializes in the techniques used
to lead men in war, would help '

preserve the academic integrity of
the _liberal_ arts education.

Drifting To ward the Big Bang

BY MATTHEWKENNEDY
It seems inevitable. There is no
way to stop it.
The United States of America is
slowly drifting towards Asia at a

, rate of about‘an inch or so a year.

And according to some experts, it
is accelerating!

The implication is devastating
Within a relatively short while, we
will no longer? have an ocean
between us and that Hotbed of
Degeneracy of Asia.

There is little or nothing to be
done about the matter except some
clear headed preparedness on the
part of our armed forces and
government. .

San Erancisco, in fact the. entire
West coast, will be ground to dust
in the initial impact, and NORAD
defense experts calculate on
losin must of New Mexico and
Nevada, which will be crinkled into
massive mountain ranges.

And yet, there has been no move
to evacuate these threatened areas,
no plans to deal with the impending
destruction. As usual Washington

is sound asleep, and why shouldn’t

ment that’s in danger of being

most importantly, and most unfor-
tunately, to the Pitt News. The first
three names are mentioned be-
cause of the injustice they received,
courtesy of the Pitt News, and the
last name because I feel it is
shameful that Scott MacLeod and
his associates could be so ignorant
as to their position on campus.
The Pitt News, for all practical
purposes, is the only undergradu-
ate newspaper on campus, and that
carries a tremendous responsibili-
ty. More than any other type of
paper, the Pitt News is obligated to
remain objective on certain sub-
jects; the Student Government vote
being one. Yet Mr. MacLeod and
the Pitt News decided to misuse
their power by endorsing a
candidate, and went so far as to try
to destroy the credibility’ of
another, Paul Hertneky. I thought
it was extremely humorous that in
the same issue the Pitt News to
destroy Hertneky, it censored a
letter of Bruce Keeler’s because
the. other candidates “would not
have the opportunity to respond.”
Well, entlemen, did Hertneky?
The Pitt News may be proud that
they have such inﬂuence over the
campus. The best example of their
weight was the victorious Socialist
candidate for SG Board, Mark
Satinoff, who was endorsed by the
He was the only
Socialist ’ candidate who outpolled

decides to accept their responsibil-
ity of objectivity, they will spend

And it doesn’t end there. Under
the auspices of the insidious
Democratic-controlled puppet con-
gress, hundreds of tons of material
is now being moved by airplane,
and in mid-air it didn’t help the
situation one bit.

This terrible situation was aided
and abetted by the Arabs, who cut
off vital oil tonnage to the United
States. And as the heavy-oil
supplies were exhausted, our
whole continent was cast off to
oblivion!

Of course the nefarious commu-
nists have taken full advantage of
the course of events, using the
Vietnam War as an excuse to build
up tons upon tons of war material,
corpses and shrapnel along_ the
Paciﬁc coast of their continent.
-And the sly Chinese have been
reproducing at an alarming‘ rate,
feeding their hordes of farmers and
opium smokers resulting in a
country of nearly one billion, very
fat human beings, living dead-

here, Mr. Average Man, no sir!
What’s all this talk of -“nuclear
weapons” using “heavy metals”

“mega-ton” blasts? ‘

How long can they pull the wool

tricked into blowing up our
supplies of “heavy metals” further

Human Emotions:

No Racial Bounds

Dear Editor:

Some people remain silent and are
thought ignorant, others open their
mouths and remove all doubt.
Such a prime example is Nick
vlzrickson in his recent letter (Pitt
News, .1-10-75). Spouting inane
generalisms, he reveals a total lack
oi any knowledge about the subject
oi which he writes. V '

There is no “universal dislike for
black-white. dating or marriage.”
Many cultures openly accept such
marriages as the union of two
human beings who just happen to
have different skin pigmentations.
Racism, especially this discrimina-
tion against inter-racial partner-
ships, is an almost uniquely Amer-
ican experience. lndeed, black

' Americans often display such neg-
ative attitudes as do white Ameri-
cans. The resulting effects on
multi-racial offspring is simply a
further manifestation of a perva-
sive sickness in this society.

"It" goes on simply because
human emotions know no such
artificial limitations. Admittedly,
there are relationships of the
rebellion and forbidden-fruit var-
icty. There are also many genuine
relationships of mature adults.
Such statements as to the virtual
exclusivity of black male/white
female interracial relationships and
the‘ preference of high-income
black males for white women are
unfounded.

T If one only bothers to look, he will
find . high income black females
with white husbands and high
income white males with black
wives. There are also inter racial
unions among the.. lower'inco_me

nibbling away at our dwindling
continental mass, Congress and
their ilk are supporting a giant
space program designed to blast
precious poundage into orbit
forever!

And now they try to toss a bone to
the rightfully aroused citizenry by
pointing to eleventh hour measures
planned to forestall the inevitable
coup de grace.

The hastily arranged purchase of
the London Bridge, new, oil
contracts with the Arabian states,
Volkeswagons from Germany,
bauxite from the Balkans. Accord-
ing to their so-called calculations,
this pitiful addition in weight
coupled with a collision with

.Hawaii will be enough to bring our
' drifting country to a halt.

In a pig’s eye it will!

The fact is, Mr. Citizen, that our
country, fatally lightened by
rubber stamped programs of mass
transferral will be smashed to
splinters, crushed «to cinders,
crunched to crackers, and bashed
to bits!

Unless an affirmative action
program is arranged under martial

’ law in the next year, the situation
,will be ' beyond hope.

Certain
experts who haven’t been bought‘
off. by the Light-Weight Axis claim
that even now we'd have to
dismantle . a country‘ the size of
England and set it down pound for
pound "on our West Coast to

prevent the Armageddon at hand. ‘

Well, here are the facts,. sir. Now
it is up to you, the run of the mill,

Whatever the social status for
sexual mix of the couple, they are
likely to attract attention. Perhaps,
courage is still considered an
admirable quality. More common-
ly the multi-racial couple encount-
ers a silent, but sometimes verbal-
ized hostility. .

If there is any distinguishing
characteristic of permanent multi-
racial unions, it would be educa-

tion. The atmosphere of University ,

life is conducive to exploration
outside the narrow confines of
one’s normal social sphere. » Not
bound by parental or societal
censorship within the unique en-
vironment of the university com-
munity, the independent individual
may respond in an open manner to
any other human being.
Within such freedom lies the
promise of the true America.

to place the blame more equitably--

up andvdown the set. A
It was supporting characters like

' these that polished a somewhat

maudlin plot. Joe Shad, Nan
Mogg, Nanette Menges, Charles
R. Altman played the heightened
caricatures with skill and know-
how.

That’s not to say that the leading
players were inefficient. In fact,
they were cursed to play straight
men to this zany mob—a fate not to
be wished on one’s little brother.
Larry Heller as the faking invalid
suffered through every single
scene and still came up caustic
from his first insult to his last
sarcastic quirk. And Mary Sweenie

, with Christopher Rawson by her

side were as wholesome as homo-
genized milk.

Both the set and costumes reﬂect-
ed the play's lighthearted nature.
The touch worked nicely, for this is
not a play to bog down with
heaviness of sight and texture. All
the play’s working parts pointed to

that one neon sign—keep it light! ‘

With the high quality of The Man

of good professional theatre in

and wry observations that this
prisoner shows at every turn,
infuriating and endearing at the
same time to his Israeli prosec-
utors.

Glass Booth, far from being a mea
culpa for the long maligned
German peoples,‘ is an aggressive
new statement on the matter of
guilt for such monumental crimes
against man as the Nazi holocaust.
True, the film often gets heavy-

handed and generally lacks sub- /

tlety (a. fault which caused the
original author and playwright,
Robert Shaw, to renounce the
screenplay and order his name

' removed from the credits), but the

power and urgency of its message
somewhat excuses this. Also, the
incessant humor, “black” though
it may be, .somehow necessitates a
corresponding dramatic overplay to
2 keep an audience well into the
proper track and not losing sight of
the ﬁlm’s objectives. -
It’s a powerfulﬁlm but never dull,
ahd moving very fast right to the

end. And the questions it asks -

aboutthe true war criminals are not-
_as easily answered as they were in
Nuremberg. ‘

Cars Hot In Overlime,

BY G.W. STEVENS-
SportsiEditor

The Pitt basketball team got
another clutch performance from

/-«a‘.Keith Starr in the overtime period

-7 lib‘ defeat

19th ranked Rutgers
University 82-79 Saturday night for
the Cats 21st straight victory in
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse. Starr scor-
ed eight points in the extra frame,
all but two from the foul line, to
bring the Panthers back from a four
point deficit raising their record to
9-7.

But the real story of the contest
was the shooting of junior guard
Tom Richards who poured in a _to l
of 22 points, his hightest output f
the season, to keep Pitt in the ball
game and enable them to overcome
a ten point Rutgers lead.

The game was fast paced from the

S, ,~,»/outset with both teams displaying a

run and gun offense with the Cats
holding aslight advantage. Rich-
ards hit for 14 points in the first ten
minutes of the game as the Cats
managed to hang onto a slim 24-23
edge.

But the Knights started to surge
midway through the period and
behind the shooting of All-Ameri-'
can candidate Phil Sellers, who
finished with 31 points, the Rutgers
squad began to grab the advan-
tage.

The two teams battled back and

‘forth for most of the remaining
minutes of the half. Unfortunately

 the Cats, Mike Dabney took

over for the. Knights ‘scoring four
quick baskets topush the Rutgers
team into a four point lead. The
Panthers tried in vain to battle back
but with Richards and Melvin
Bennett on the bench, they soon
found themselves at a 48-38 half-
time disadvantage.

t - But the Panthers were not to be‘

/{Ed/'5El€lll€Cl in the second half as they

3

took control of the 'ganief'from the
tip and soon closed the gap to
54-52. Starr hit for two baskets,
one on a nearly impossible shot
with his back to the basket.

Richards continued to-bomb away‘

from the outside hitting three more

times to add to his 14 point

performance of the first half.

"Amoeba" which sucked 'up the
passes of the rattled
Knights.’ The Cats played well
enough to stay within two points
through most of the half as the
game kept the 5,249 fans on the
edges of their seats.

With about five minutes remain-
ing Kirk Bruce gave Pitt a one point
lead with a follow on a Bennett
shot, but Hollis Copeland brought
the Knights right back with a
driving layup for a 66-65 lead.
Bennett then made two free throws
and Ed Jordan hit from 15 feet to
again maintain the lead.

Lew Hill then managed to battle
through to the boards and after two
tips his layup fell through the nets
for a ()9-68 Pitt lead. Copeland got
the Knights even on their next trip
down the ﬂoor when he made one
of two foul shots after a foul on
Starr. H

The Knights managed to get the
ball back with -25 seconds on the
clock and the score still tied. They
played for one shot but the rugged
Cat defense kept them away from
the high percentage areas until
Steve I-Iefele managed to get off a
shot from the baseline which hit the .
rim and was rebounded by the
Panthers. ' ,

Sellers led off the overtime by
hitting two 20 ‘footers for the
Knights and Hill countered with a
tip-in. Jordan, added another for
Rutgers and Pitt found themselves
down four points as the boisterous
fans began to scream for the Cats
to get moving.

Starr then took control of the
game and started the Cats running
again. He hit on a rebound of a
Richards shot which was followed
by a 25 footer by Pitt's Larry Harris

knottingi the score at 75. The
defense continued to hold the

A fter   Dropping Relays

BY TOM HALL

The Pitt Panther swimming team
ran up against the Golden Flashes,
losing a tough 58-55 decision. It
was however, one of the best dual
-meet performances the Panthers
have had to date.

‘L The tankers lost both relays,

which ended up deciding the meet. '

In the individual meets, the swim-
mers were up to the challenge of
facing their toughest competition to
date.

John Schepner won two events in
grand fashion, his specialities, the
100 and 200 yard freestyles. Jerry
DeMuro, who makes a habit of
spectacular performances, won
both the 500 and 1000 yard

. freestyles. * "

Jerry is in for the biggest’ chal-_
lenge of his 1975 season next week
when he meets Matt Glenn of

Cdylaryland in a duel‘-of the best long

~T’Ei'i'stance freestylers in the East. In
an event in which DeMuro has had
little or no close competition, this
matchup should produce a ‘good
race, as well as some record settin
times. —
‘In an event_ that typified the
Panther’s day, Carlos Santiago set

a new team record in the 200 yeard
Individual Medley with a time of

.2:02.4, only to finish second. He

did win the 200 yard backstroke in
2:0l.3.

Dave Natali, how has been shoot-
ing to break the two minute mark in
his 200 yard butterﬂy event, swam
to a team record 1:58, again only to
finish second. John Templin did a
fine job in winning the 200 yard
breaststroke in 2:18.4.

In the ‘diving ’ events, Coach Al
Coffey must have,‘ been ecstatic
with his charges performances. In
the one-meter diving Dave Reeder
qualified for the NCAA champion-
ships with a socre of 281.9. Tom
Faytol finished second in the
one-meter with a scoreof 272. _
Hitting. every dive with the cool of
a professional, Tom Faytol won the
three-meter diving event with a
phenomenal 333.25 eclipsing along
standing Pitt team record of 317.
F aytol’s performance also qualiﬁed
him to compete in the NCAA
championships with a score of
better than 300 points.

Knights as Starr did some fine ball
handling forcing Rutgers to commit
several devastating fouls.

Starr went to the foulline three
times in the final two minutes of
the period hitting all six of his tries
to raise his game total to 17. A
basket by Bruce on a goaltending
call was all the Cats needed as
Rutgers added baskets by Dabney‘
and Sellers but came up short
82-79.

Both teams hit for 42 percent of
their shots in the game but the
Knights held an edge of the foul
stripe where they were 21-24
compared to the Panthers 10-15
effort. The Knights also outre-
bounded Pitt 53-41, although Starr
grabbed 11, but the Cats controlled
the boards to a greater extent in the
crucial second half.

The Cats next performance will
come in the Palestra on Wednesday
night when they meet Temple. The
Owls are not as solid as the,Knights
who now have an 11-4, record but
will have a big advantage over the
Cats who are still lgoking for their
first roadgwin. I

33, Delaware’s 26, and ACC’s 15.

Two varsity records were broken
as Pitt ran upits highest point total
of the young season. ,

Willie Walker, in just his first year
of track, ran the 50 yard dash in 5.3
seconds surpassing the old mark of
5.4 originally set in 1962. But the
real reason for Walker’s success
was because of a mad streak in his
short muscularrframe.

“The guy from Ohio complained
he had a set of bad starting

. blocks,” explained the goateed

Junior.” Coach didn’t want to hurt
anyone’s feelings so he gave my
teammate the bad blocks to keep
the peace. I guess that was what I
needed to win the race.”

A 5.3 isn’t half bad but Walker
had been looking for better things.

' “I had no power in the trials. I was

running but not accomplishing
anything. I wanted a.ﬁve ﬂat but
mostly I ran for the team. More
work is what I need.” _
The other record fell in the 1000
yard run where Rich Markley took
the lead with the starting gun and
kept widening it as the race wore
on. He ran a 2:1l.4 shattering the
old mark by a full half second.
“Sparkle,” as he was nicknamed
by teammates, didn’t stop there as
-he anchored the winning two mile
relay team .putting on a strong
ﬁnish edging out the‘ Kentucky
With his star studded T-shirt and
brown hair falling in his eyes,
Markleystated he had been trying
for the record from the beginning.
“I was trying to qualify for the

I Nationals today so I could forget

about it and concentrate on my
running. But now I have to prepare
for it all over again. The pressure is

_ still on me.” .

St. Francis,   

  Remain Tied For First

BY STEVE SYBERT

It could have been worse.

The Pitt Hockey Club soundly
beat St. Francis, 12-2, at the Civic
Arena on Saturday, but the score
could very well have been run up to
20, even 30-2.

After taking a 9-1 first period
lead,
headed for the greatest laughter of
all time. But respect for the fallen
opponent prevented Pitt from
reaching an astronomical total.

Pitt put the pressure on the
Frankies right away, missing
chance after chance in the opening
minutes. Yet itwas only a matter of
time before the ticking bomb
exploded.

Captain Charlie Hagins came up
with the detonator with 2:17 gone.
Hagins poked in the rebound of
linemate Denny Browne’s shot on a
play that defenseman John Finney
started, and the Panthers were off
and running.

Thirty-nine seconds later, » Jeff
Saunders took Bill Gedeon’s pass
and ﬂipped one by the St. Francis
goaltender, Dave Correia. Russ
Stump was also credited with an
assist.

The Frankies got on the score-
board at the 3:33 mark, destroying
surprise starting goaltender Paul.
Huger’s bid for a shutout. Huger,
playing with a lot of poise in only
his second appearance, had no
chance on a close-in rebound shot.-

The Panthers roared right back
though when Val Troy slapped in a
20-footer only 14 seconds later,

Rick Vernon scored the first of his
three goals with 5:55 gone after
taking a feed from Bob Arturo and
deking Correia out of position.

Before the ink was dry on
Vernon’s tally, Hagins added
another, giving Pitt a 5-1 lead,
again with only 14 seconds

the Panthers appeared‘

elapsing. With Correia out of the
net and a defenseman prone in the
crease, Hagins merely tucked in
the loose puck.

Great work as a line by Saunders,

Gedeon and Chuck Crisanti ac--
counted for Pitt's next two goals. 4

First Saunders tapped in Gedeon’s
rebound at 8:06 and then Gedeon
returned the favor 35 seconds later.
Crisanti helped out on both plays.

Pitt tallied its eighth and ninth

goals while ﬁnding Correia either.

out of position or down on the ice.
Vernon and Saunders ‘each took

advantage of the goaltender’s flaws.

in building the lead to 9-1. v -
' Saunders produced his 11th goal

and, of course, the three-goal hat_

trick.

Despite the score, Correia _.per-,,

formed well in the ‘St. Francis goal.

‘ The‘ Panthers showered him with_

33 shots in the opening period,
meaning he came through with 24
saves. Nevertheless, John Novak
took over the position for the
remainder of the game.

Novak faced a milder Panther
attack in periods two and three,
allowing one of only 12 second
period shots to reach the net and
two of 17 in the third frame. ’

Vernon got the single tally of the
middle stanza on one of his
patented solo rushes. The three-
goal performancg brought his
season total to 23.

In the third Heriod, it was
Crisanti, taking a behind the net
pass from Gedeon, at 3:54 -and
Troy, again, set up by. Dave
Rubinstein and Paul Fipschione wit
4:35 gone. ‘

With the game out of reach, Bill _

Pfeiffer scored for the Frankies

with nine minutes remaining for a

bit of consolation only. _
Overall, the Panthers outshot St.

called Quemoy and Matsu. The lat-
est musical fad was something called
“rock ’n’ roll.” A Chevrolet sedan
cost $2000. A nickel candy bar felt
pretty hefty in your hand. "
Funny, but whenever you start

' playing the nostalgia game, you al-

ity.,But this is a fatal device in a free
market—-consumers catch- on quick-
ly. The other way is to maintain the
quality but cut the cost of manufac-
ture. If the product is soup cans, for
instance, it means producing more
and better soup cans for the time

and labor spent. That’s what’s called
improved productiuity.

Now wait a minute. Don’t head
for the exits. We’re not talking about
men turning screws faster or run-
ning around with ladders and oil-
cans like characters in an old-time
movie. We're simply considering
how all of us here in America affect
the prices of things we buy through
the way we work. Just ponder, for
example, what happens when a mix
of technology, planning and worker
motivation spells high productivity.

Major manufacturers of hand-held
power tools in Germany, Iapan and
England have not been able to pene-
trate the American market because
high-quality American-made hand
tools are competitively low in price.
One of the major forces behind this
situation is the Black 8: Decker
Manufacturing Co., of Towson, Md.
For the past 16 years, sales of its
products have grown an astonishing
17 percent "a year, and during that
time the prices of many of these
products have dropped steadily.

The company secret? Better pro-
ductivity. In part, this comes from
the wise investment of funds in new
machines and advanced research.
But beyond that, Black 8: Decker’s
management and workers constant-
ly set goals for themselves and
meet them—not necessarily by do-
ing things faster, but by doing
them better. A typical problem:
Company engineers knew they could
vastly improve safety from electrical

shock by. doubling the thickness of

ADVERTISEMENT

insulation inside hand tools. But this
would have added ten percent to
manufacturing costs. Solution: Re-
design of the tools, streamlining
assembly and standardizing many
small parts so the same onescould
be used in different tools. Prices of
the safer tools remained the same.
While such improved productivity
has paid off in increased sales and
proﬁts, it has also paid off for em-
ployes. The company payroll in

1958 was $14.5 million for 3800 em- ,

ployes. Last year’s payroll was
$165.2 million for 20,700 employes.

And look at the payoff for the con-
sumer: In 1958, Black & Decker’s
basic electric drill for do—it-your-
selfers cost $18.95. Now it costs
$10.99. A standard jigsaw that sold
for $44.50 in 1958 now costs $11.99.
And remember, these price changes
occurred during a 16-year period
which saw the U. S. Consumer Price
Index rise 75.2 percent.

But the productivity payoﬁ can
also mean a lot ‘more than new jobs
and higher pay. Sometimes it spells
survival. Consider the 1000 cm-
ployes of the Ideal Corporation, a
maker of precision automotive parts,
in Brooklyn, N. Y. Saddled with an
old plant and rising costs, Ideal re-
cently looked into building a modern
plant in the Midwest. The move
would vastly reduce the cost of trans-
porting its products, and the cost of
the factory was expected to be about
$15 a square foot. Putting up a new
plant in Brooklyn, on the other hand,
would run at least $25 a square foot,

and related operating costs looked
certain to -leave the company in an
extremely diﬂicult competitive po-
sition. But Ideal had a loyal and
skilled work force. It elected to re-
main in Brooklyn. Says Iohn Wen-
zel, president of the company: “We

decided to gamble on our ability -to -

engineer processes that would reduce
our costs.” In other words, the pro-
ductivity of Ideal‘s managers, engi-
neers and workers kept their 1000
jobs in Brooklyn. And the company
is thriving in its new plant.
Despite these by-no-means-iso-
lated examples, there is disturbing
evidence that America is slipping
into a productivity crisis. While our
productivity has historically grown
at a healthy rate of about 3 percent
annually, in recent years the growth
rate has been falling; last year we
had no productivity gain at all.
Too many American businesses have
been failing because" they could not
achieve the higher productivity that
would enable them to afford the
higher wages and shorter hours de-
manded of them. Others have hiked
prices to pay the higher wages, with
a resultant loss of business to for-
eign competition. Nine out of every
ten baseball mitts sold in this land
of Babe Ruth and Henry Aaron are
foreign-made. So are 19 out of every
20 motorcycles, one out of six cars.
Since 1967, foreign industry has
caused a reductionof at least 400,000
American jobs. That’s why produc-

ADVERTISEMENT

tivity—all of us putting more in. and
getting morerout of our jobs-is of
such. crucial importance.
Fortunately,’we don’t have to run
around tearing our hair out to solve
the problem. Nor do we even have to
learn productivity from books or lec-
tures. Indeed, that would be a sad
estimation of the people of a nation
whose history has been in a sense a
historyof productivity. For produc-
tivity 18 many things. It is the ability
of a businessman to attract dollars

‘to build new plants and create new

jobs. It derives—from intensive- re-

search that gives us advanced tech—' ’

nology. And productivity is also an
impulse. _

It’s the impulse that helps a house-
wife organize her day to cook tur-
key, bake a pie, set the table, get
dressed and greet friends and rela-
tives at the door at one o’clock. It’s

— the impulse that- ‘makes diagonal

“I was psyched out by the dude
from Ohio,” Sharpley explained.
“He came out of the blocks very
fast and I could feel myself
watching him. Concentrating more
on my running and less on the
competition will help me more than
anything.” .

The “Golden Flash” known better
as Karl Farmer ran his race, the

440, in the time of 48.9 qualifying '

him for theNational championships
held in Detroit in March. Farmer
took the lead and for the last half of
the ﬁnal lap -practically jogged to
victory a full second ahead of the
second place ﬁnisher. '
Coming back in less than two
hours Farmer anchored‘ the mile
relay team and breezed to a win in
the‘ event‘ by five seconds.

After all the activity had died
down and the relatively small but
enthusiastic crowd had departed a
happy Coach Banner was found
leaning against the scorer’s table."

5'1 was very surprised the meet
wasn’t a lot closer,” Banner
related. “Kentucky’s distance men
(one of their strong points) were hit
with the ﬂu right before the meet
and couldn’t get out of bed.”

“Our young players are really
coming along, the relaxed-looking
Banner continued. “As a whole the
team looked great. Rich [Markley]
missed the Nationals by only four

/

tenths of a second and Karl’

[Farmer] made it which is excellent
this early in the season.

“I was a littl.e disappointed with
the high jump but they will be
coming back strong as we go on.
The team is now looking forward to
the Invitational February 28 and
March 1st at the Field House where
we face the real competition.”

Once again the Tracksters could
say, “We have met the competition
and they are ours.” But the
Invitational should prove to be the
best test of all. ’
