'. any writings containing a fresh

idea, a novel approach to human
problems, or interesting charac-
, terization. ' .

The author of any story ac-
cepted for production by Screen
Gems will be paid $500 for all.

story produced by Screen Gems,
a further. sum of $250 will be
paid the_ University of Pitts-

‘TILL WE MEET AGAIN

I always ﬁnd myself yawninghugely when a comedian,

[having ﬁnished his act, steps out i'n front of the curtain, ’
takes off his putty nose, assumes a sincere stance, and de- ’

livers an oration full of tender and lofty sentiments.

So how come I’m doing precisely the same thing right now ? ;,

Two reasons. First, because I couldn’t possibly make you I
laugh at this time of the year; cramming for ﬁnals has left 4 _
you wan, woebegone, and in no mood for innocent merriment;

Second, because this is the last column of the current
just a tiny

series, and I’d be a liar if I didn’t admit I was
bit choked up.

It was two years ago that the makers of Philip Morris  
' asked me to writethis column. My ﬁrst .impu1se, frankly, _'

was to saytno. Though I am a man who likes a dollar aswell

as the next fellow, my talents just do not seem to lead me 
in the direction of‘-writing advertising copy. When called. .
. ‘upon to rhapsodize about soap or_sox or cigarettes, I get to ,

giggling uncontrollably and have to be helped home.

“Buddies,” said I to the makers of Philip Morris, “I smoke‘ _', ’

Philip «Morris myself, and I think it’s a jim-dandy cigarette.’
But that’s all I think it is — a cigarette. Not a graven image.

 On Campus

. ., ,.,_‘-_ . I‘
«I: 14:5‘ 

N ot a love object. Just a smoke. I’m afraid I can’t get rev-°"  ’

erent enough to write ad copy for you.”

V To my astonishment, they seemed delighted. “Reverence 

is not required,” said the people at Philip Morris. They as-

sured me that I would not be required to write fulsome com-“'7 .  V. *

mercials — that I could rib the cigarette and the company all ' 3 4
- I liked —— that my columns would be mine alone, with noﬂ ‘g-_;

editing, no suggestions, and no supervision.
“Hah l” I said by way of reply.
But they kept insisting and ﬁnally, my thin breast full of‘
misgivings, I went to work.

_ For the ﬁrst few weeks they were scrupulously true to
their words. Not one syllable, not one comma, was ever
changed; not one quarter-ounce of pressure was ever exerted.

But my doubts were not laid to rest. “When will the honey-~ 

moon be_ over?” I kept asking myself. _

The‘ answer, gentle readers, is that the honeymoon is , A

still going on. This ﬁnishes my second year for Philip Morris.
During that time, though I’m sure my copy caused an occa-A.

sional conniption ﬁt in the boardroom, my carte blanche has‘ 

remained as blcmche as the day it was issued. Whatever Iive

perpetrated in this. column has been, as they guaranteed, ‘

mine.alone.
They've been living dolls, the makers of Philip Morris,

and I think I may be forgiven for getting a triﬂe misty. And ’. 4 V.
as long as the stops are out, let me say that it’s also been a. , 

big charge writing for you, the college population of America.
Your response has warmed my old heart, and on the occasions
when I’ve visited your campuses, it’s been deeply gratifying
to see that you're still as pleasantly disorganized as ever.

I ﬁgure that as long as the likes of you exist, I’m in business.‘ " 5 ‘

So, for now, goodbye. Stay well. Stay happy. Stay loose.

approximately one half. are se-
lected for further education at the
War College.

Pitt Men Cited

Speaking of the calibre of Pitt
ROTC members, the Colonel said,
“In my short career (20 years) I
don’t think I’ve been associated
with a more highly principled and
more highly motivated group of
men than I found here at Pitt.”

“I have been aware of this
fact,” he continued, “both at
summer camp at Ft. Belvoir,
Virginia and here at school dur-
ing the past three terms.”

Col. Eister is very active in
affairs at the Univeristy both
military and non-military. He is
an honorary member of Omicron
[Delta Kappa. He regularly attends

 CarnivaI Judging

The fuss over carnival judging this year was a little

‘louder than usual. Disagreement with the judges’ total

decision has come from Pitt faculty members, outside visit-
ors, Pitt students themselves, and even from neighboring
Duquesne University. The commotion has lead to a criti-
_cal analysis of our system of selecting the judges for car-

~ nival and the judging itself.

Well Worth Paying For,‘

Union Respon

By Irv Roi-hmen

The welcome news that limited lounge area and

September means that students will take on added
responsibility. We’ll join the expansion program,
‘not only by using newly—purchased facilities, but
also by helping to pay for them

No one can ignore the fact that along with the
announcement we learned a Stu-
dent Union fee of $7.50 will be
added to the tuition bill. Realiz-
ing that one of Dr. Litchﬁeld’s big 
responsibilities will be to raise
funds, students should be willing
to pay into the general student
union costs. .‘ '

It would be trite to say that
we’ll get out of it what we put
into it. But we won’t have to si
in the Tuck Shops or Cafeteria continuously. It’s
worth it. -

concern. Teaching difficulties will have to be modi-- ,
ﬁed swiftly to do justice to those who have taught
so well despite the circumstances and to insure that 
top-ﬂight instructors who come to stay at Pitt. 
Along the lines of Dr. Litchﬁeld’s‘ speech we ’ 
' received a brief not the other night from Janice, . 
that persevering cat from Homestead who, as a‘ 
second year freshman, has been an astute observer . c
of the University scene. ~ -- A

any one who prefers to

ichancellor Litchﬁeld’s eloque ' remarks last
Wednesday, following the ’Monday announcement
turned out to be a summary for students of what
he has been saying in policy releases and special
speeches to University groups. Northing new was
said, but everything that was said was about the

Comparison of per capita book purchase be-
tween Harvard ($169) and Pitt ($19) were shock-
ing; but his inference to reducing teaching loads
was more important at this stage of. the game.

We know of professors who require no papers?
from students because they just haven’t time to
mark them, so pre—occupied are they with graduate
work and other courses. There is also no deﬁned
staff for graduate students;_ it is appalling consid-
ering that in the Graduate Schooliof Business Ad-1
ministration at Cornell there is such specialization

thatevcn a Dean of Students is emphasized.
These latter considerations will be Chancellor
Litchﬁeld’s and especially Dean Crawford’s major

Committee was not tolblame for this since arrangements _

part ofthe judges: individually. Certainly several criteria
have to be agreed upon to avoid personal likes and dis-
likes. For instance, personal opinion ‘might be avoided to

.a- degree by including audience reaction on the rating

sheet for, as noted by one of this year’s judges, “what every-
body else likes, I might not like.” Some students have gone

' so far as to suggest a public vote on the shows. This might

prove a fair system if it can be ‘shown that the majority of
visitors are not related to students in the shows, thus
avoiding partisan voting. ' - .

Partisan voting is a big problem and one of the reasons
why Carnival Committees have shunned Pitt faculty mem-
bers as judges. The reasoning is logical but it should be
taken into consideration that faculty members probably

‘realize more than outsiders the work put into Carnival

They, therefore, might take the responsibility more serious-
ly. . The goal, of course, is to obtain sincere, responsible peo-
ple who will realize the importance of their job. If this
means paying them, why avoid it?

There’ is another solution that may be offered. That is’
to do away with trophies altogether. Some students feel

‘this would eliminate the competitive spirit of Carnival.

»On the other hand, the desire to produce a good show

‘ just for the fun and experience of itmight be developed.

If this seems too radical, perhaps three awards could be
given out with no ﬁrst, second, or third place tags at-
.tached to them. The competitive spirit would still be there, ’

the three winners should rank.

The problem is a tough one but one which, like any
other problem, can be solved with careful thinking and
planning. The question is, are there people in the Univer-
sity willing to take on the responsibilty and time, in order
to make future Carnivals a fair deal without question.

'Letters To

Civil Liberties‘

Editor,
Pitt News
Dear Sir:
An editorial in a recent issue of
the Pitt News dared the Univer-
" sity’s two political groups, ‘ the
Young Republican Association
and the Young Democrat Club, t_o
accept the challenge of exerting
dynamic inﬂuence concerning
Civil Liberties. They felt that the
lack of such action necessitated

the forming of a local National“

Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. -

Today (Monday, May 21), the
Young Republicans accepted the’
responsibility by ' appointing a
committee, headed by Art Mac-_
Cafferty, to work with the
NAACP toward. its goal of edu-
cating the public in the ﬁeld of

civil liberties. May I point out
that the University of Pittsburgh
Young Republicans, like their
parent organization, have been
the ﬁrst to defend the rights of
the Negro by deﬁnite action,
Sincerely yours,
Lynn Watson
President, Young Republicans
.(We' would expect no less of
any political party working
along with ‘or independent of
the NAACP. We’ll applaud when
we see.conc'rete action taken.
Committees are good——working.

Arnie Sowell, Panther main-
stay on the past four track
squads, will bow out as a Blue
and Gold track star this com-
ing weekend when the thin-
clads travel to New York for
the IC4A meet.

Running in his specialty, the
880—yard run, Sowell will get his

‘ last test as a collegian before try-

ing out for the United States
Olympic team. Perry Jones will
also enter this event for the Pan-
thers.

Sowell will also compete in the
broad jump, an event in which the
Panther ace has seen little com-
petition, lately. Bill Smith, who
last week set a new ﬁeld record
for the pole‘ vault at Penn State
with avault of 13 feet, 8 inches,
will try to pick up some points for
the Panthers’ in the broad jump.‘

itself weak in the weight events,
