Pitt center

to research

toxic waste

Pitt announced yesterday that the
University Trust has established a
center for hazardous materials
research. The center, located at the
Pittsburgh University Research
Center in Harmarville, Pa., will
operate as a separate non-profit cor-
poration.The new center is expected
to be ‘fully operational within the
next six months.

-Pitt President Wesley Posvar said
the proper management of hazard-
ous waste and materials in society is
“one of the most critical issuesfacing
us for the balance of this century.”
Posvar said the new center is form-
ing a nationwide consortium of uni-
versities and research organizations

. to tackle such problems as public

policy, public health and environ-
mental hazards and economic diffi-

ﬁﬁculties surrounding hazardous

‘ waste.

“The problems are bigger than
any one discipline, and the expertise
is scattered throughout the coun-
try,” he said. “No single institution
has the expertise or the capacity for
this kind of applied research.”

The center will conduct applied
research into technologies for reduc-
ing, re-using, detoxifying and dis-
posing of hazardous materials.
Other activities include education,
training, testing and consulting ser-
vices, technology transfer and envir-
onmental policy analysis.

Dr. Samuel Schulhof, vice presi-
dent for program development at
Pitt, has been named as- the acting
president of the new center.

“Hazardous materials and waste
exist in virtually every industrial and
manufacturing 'process,” Schulhof
said. “We should know the risks
involved, and be developing better
ways to control, minimize and elimi-
nate the risks and dispose of any
waste that remains.”

Schulhof spent four years as an
associate administrator and deputy
assistant administrator of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency,

where he was responsible for coordi- _

nating policy between the national
headquarters in Washington, D.C.,
and the EPA’s regional offices.

“Monday Night Football” when

 

Dave Hooker T Pitt News I

By Bobby Smouse
Staff Writer

On Aug. I9 when Victor Pexe’s
mother and father held a birthday
party in honor 01 their sonfs second
birthday, the atmosphere was much
like any other two-year-old’s birth-
day — cake, ice cream, balloons and
many giggles.

And yet, something was very dif-
ferent about the scene at Victor’s
birthday party. It couldn’t be seen by
looking at Victor, with his soft eyes
beaming and his baby smile spread
across his face. And it could barely
be seen by looking at his parents.

The Pexe family has had to deal
with their son's liver disfunction
which ultimately threatens his life.

“Victor's liver does not function_

properly,’ andgthe only cure is to
transplant another liver into his

body. We fear for his life every

Titled "I want a PR Job,” the con-
ference will give students a closer

look at public relations careers by .

answering such questions as “What
the job entails, where the openings
are in the market and how to get
started in the field.”

“Pitt is a hard campus to reach,”
said Karen Hoy, conference organ-
izer. “There aren’t_enough courses
offered that specialize in public rela-
tions. Students can’t call a public
relations department or advisor for
help in this field. That’s why the con-
ference is a great chance for Pitt stu-
dents to get the information they
can’t find on campus.”

Hoy is a Pitt alumnus who works
as the director of marketing com-
munication for Arthur Young & Co.
and said she loves her work because

"‘ We fear for his life every second...He could last- I
one year, or he could go to sleep at night and not

wake up. ” -

— Sandra Pinto, Victor’s mother

second,” said Victor’s mother, San-
dra Pinto, weeping as she described
her son’s misfortune through a Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh interpreter.
“He could last one year, or he could
go to sleep tonight and not wake
up.”
i The Pexe family is from Piraci-
aba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and they
have been living in Pittsburgh since
March 1985 praying for a liver that
will give their son new life. He is
presently on the Pittsburgh Chil-
dren’s Hospital liver transplant
waiting list, but. the ‘possibility of
finding a liver that exactly matches
his needs is very small.

Yet the Pexe family will not give

it is “tremendously satisfying and
always changes with the environ-
ment or problem at hand.”
“Enthusiasm for the job is impor-
tant when meeting potential
employers and contacts," Hoy said.

This “networking,” or creating a ,

group of contacts to help find a job,
will be discussed Friday. For exam-
ple, sometimes a large company will
interview a person and refer him to
another, smaller company.

These referrals are important,
Hoy said, because the company sees
potential in the person but may feel
he needs more experience before
working for them. In any case,
they're more likely to remember that
person when he comes back to that
company later. In the meantime,
they send him to another company

up hope. “We pray to the Lord each
day that our son will get well,” said
his father, Victor Pexe Neto. “We
have put him in the hands of the
Lord and only ask that he doesn’t

. suffer. Lord willing, our son will

receive a successful transplant that
will give him his life.”
Unfortunately, like so many other
patients on the transplant list, the
Pexes do not have _ the $160,000
needed to perform the operation.
Fund raisers in their home coun-
try of Brazil have produced $86,000,

. but chances of the Pexes’ raising the

remaining money needed is very
bleak. “The people in Brazil have
been so generous,” said Victor's

with the message, “ We believe in this
person — maybe he can help you,”
Hoy said.

Approximately 50 public rela-
tions professionals will be available
during the conference to answer spe-
cific questions and to offer advice.
They will represent different com-
panies and agencies, including Ket-
chum Corporation, Hill and
Knowlton and Creamer, and Dixon
and Basford. Carl Shkutski, a Pitt
graduate who began his own com-
pany, will also be present at the con-
ference.

There will be a buffet luncheon for
$3.50, and each table will be hosted

‘by a professional. Students can

choose which professional they
would like to meet.

Hoy said she hopes that Pittstus

Students seek funds for transplant

mother, "but the economic situation
in our country is very bad, and I
worry that we will not be able to get
the rest of the money.”

In addition to the Brazilian fund
raiser, an effort is being made by the
Pitt International Studies Organiza-
tion to raise the ‘remaining funds.

Pitt International Student Organ-
ization has organized a fund raiser
that will kick.off during Homecom-
ing Week and last throughout the
year. “A booth will be set up at the
University Center for International
Studies Travel Fair that will take
place Oct. l2,” said Lisa Machado,

president of PISO. “We also have

plans to hold a Valentine’s Day
dance at Zelda’s and an Interna-
tional Cultural Festival in March
that will raise money for Victor.”

Anyone wishing to contribute
money to the Pexes’ can send their
donations‘ to Pittsburgh National
Bank’s “Special Accounts.” The
account is in Victor Pexe Neto’s
name.

“Duquesne hosts conference on public relations careers

dents come to the conference
because it can also help them decide
which courses are most important
for a public relations career. Courses
that cover public relations writing,
campaigns and case studies of suc-
cessful and unsuccessful campaigns
help students discover the field.
Internships give the best “hands on”
experience (how to get a good -
internship will also be a part of the
conference). Although Pitt doesn’t
have a public relations department,
students can search for the courses
that come closest in these
requirements.

“A few students will walk away
from the conference with intern-
ships,” Hoy predicted. “Somebody
may even get hired,” but everyone
will be glad that they came.

Reagan bans flow of S. African Krugerrands into (1.8.

Washington — -President Reagan
is stopping the ﬂow of South Afri-
can Krugerrand coins into the Unit-
ed States.

Reagan announced his action yes-
terday, saying, “It’s directed at apar-
theid and the South African

-government and not at the South

African people.”

Acting with the knowledge of

Montour hires
substitute teachers

Pittsburgh — The Montour
School District in Allegheny County
has hired I27 substitute teachers to
temporarily replace striking
teachers. The move represents one
of the few times in the l5-year his-
tory of teacher bargaining in Penn-
sylvania that a school district has
tried to operate a full program in
defiance of a teacher’s strike.

School board bargainer Joseph
Kulik said the decision to hire sub-

stitutes was a last-resort step taken
after the teachers turned down the
board's very last, very best contract
offer.

The board said school would start
today and Thursday for most of its
2,800 students and Monday for the
rest. Teachers have promised mass
picketing at school entrances, using
teachers from other districts and
members of other labor unions. The
teachers said they would not block
substitutes crossing picket lines, but
would let them know how they felt
about the matter.

‘legitimate .

30 others injured in an attack
believed to be retaliation for the
slaying of three Israelis in Cyprus.
The state department confirms that

U.S. built planes were used in the

Greer guilty of
cocaine sales

Pittsburgh — Shelby Greer of
Philadelphia yesterday pleaded
guilty to selling cocaine to major-
league baseball players. He was sen-
tenced to 12 years in prison.

Greer was described by Assistant
U.S. Attorney James Ross as “an
individual who defied the American
work ethic and pursued the quick-
and-easy dollar.”

The sentence was imposed by

Judge Barron McCune. It was the
most severe given so far in a series of
cases involving the sale of drugs to
ballplayers.

Greer, 29, who at times made road
trips with the Pittsburgh Pirates,
pleaded guilty to seven of 10 drug-
related counts in a plea bargain with
the prosecution.

Greer, who earlier had pleaded
innocent, also was sentenced to a
special three years probation to fol-
low the prison term. He was taken
from the courtroom in handcuffs
after the sentencing.

Censorship

Undeniably, today much that is produced by the _

music industry is offensive, tasteless or downright
pornographic. Immoral behavior is often cele-
brated, and abandoned pleasure-seeking is espoused '
as a virtue. Disturbingly, it is to the impressionable
American youth whom the music industry appeals.
This forces us to ask: What should be done to save
our children from the evil, corrupting inﬂuences of
modern music? '

Censorship of albums is not the answer. Excesses‘
in such an endeavor would certainly give rise to
various instances of artistic restraint. Furthermore,
this would raise a problem — namely, what criteria
are ethical to use in the determination of an album’s
suitability for commercial release? We have only to
look at the history of censorship in literature — in
the past such critically acclaimed literary works a_s
Mark Twain’s “Huckleberry Finn,” J .D., Salinger’s
“Catcher In The Rye” and James J oyce’s “A Portrait
of The Artist As A Young Man” have been, in some
respects, subject to censorship —— to recognize that
grave misjudgements are bound to occur.

Nor does imposing a rating system seem advisa-
ble. As artistically dubious as music is today, a rating
system would likely lead to greater heights of vapid-
ity. In order to have the mass appeal of a “G” or
“PG” rating, musicians would be forced to adopt the
inanity of, say, Hall and Oates. I

Perhaps a more appropriate answer rests within
the family unit. Love, caring and kindness within the
family would probably go a long.way toward instil-
ling America’s children with proper values. Maybe
concerned parents should spend less time gaining
notoriety on Phil Donahue and more time sharing in
the interests of their children.

——Letters to the Editor

Houﬁng

After reading Michael Ashford’s
recent commentary (The Pitt News,
Sept. 30) on housing problems at
Pitt, I feel compelled to write. While
I believe there are some problems
with housing, they are minor and
Mr. Ashford’s comments are
unreasonable and misleading.

You must have an equitable sys-
tem for allotting the 4,172 spaces
among incoming freshmen and
returning students. According to
Housing, 1,927 beds are allotted to
returning students and about 1,500
beds are "allotted to freshmen (the
extra being allotted for RAs, schol-
arship athletics, etc.), which is
almost an even distribution. This
sounds reasonable to me.

The question of how to allot the
spaces occurs. For returning stu-
dents, the lottery is obviously the
most fair and equitable. It gives all
returning students an equal chance
of getting a contract. If you'don’t
pick a good number, you don’t get a
contract. This process is completed
in March, which gives students five
months to look for an apartment or
to ‘make other arrangements. For
freshmen, a first-come, first-served
basis is also reasonable. If you want
housing, apply early. While the let-
ter to the freshmen may have been
worded poorly, the idea was correct.
Space is limited and freshmen must
apply early.

Certainly some minor improve-
ments can be made to the system,
but a major overhaul would not
improve the situation. Mr. Ash-
ford’s arrogant attitude will also not
improve the situation.

The article on Pitt Professor Jake
Milliones and his work against
apartheid (The Pitt News, Sept. 30)
neglected to mention that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh itself continues
to have major stock holdings in
companies that do business in South
Africa, thus benefiting directly or
indirectly from apartheid. The Pitt
administration and board of trustees
have steadfastly refused to divest
these holdings, claiming that the
companies represented in them all
subscribe to the so-called Sullivan
Principles, a set ‘of equal opportun-
ity rules for businesses in South
Africa. But most foes of apartheid
— including Bishop Tutu —- regard
the Sullivan Principles as inade-
quate, since they provide for reform
only on a business-by-business basis
and therefore don't challenge the
apartheid system as a whole.
whole.

Pitt also has stock in a company
called Owens-Illinois, which does
business in South Africa and does
not subscribe to the Sullivan Princi-
ples (it has also been involved in a
union-busting effort at two nursing
homes here in Pittsburgh). Owens-
Illinois has been “given time" by the
trustees to agree to sign the Sullivan
Principles. How much time is the
South African police giving young
people there who are demonstrating
against apartheid?

Among the universities in this
country that have acted to partially

or totally divest their stock in South .

Africa are Brown, the City‘ Univer-
sity of New York system, Dart-
mouth, Georgetown, Grinnell,
Harvard, the University of Iowa,
Iowa State, the State University of
New York system, Rutgers and
_Yale. Whv can’t Pitt be at the fore-
front of the struggle against apart-
heid along with these universities

, instead of dragging its heels? How

does it feel to know that some of the
funds that go to run Pitt come from
apartheid?

south to Morgantown. While there,
we proudly displayed our Pitt colors
to the constantly rowdy, excited
Mountaineer fans. .
The night before the game, we
engaged in several shouting matches
with the natives but stood our

ground on enemy turf. It was a very
special night with incredible excite-
ment in the air. This is a very intense
rivalry, and the West Virginians like
nothing better than to beat Pitt.
Game day came and the stadium
filled quickly. The Pitt fans were
psyched, but the overwhelming
Mountaineer vocal advantage gave
us problems. We felt great at half-
time with a 10-0 lead, but unfortu-
nately the game ended in ’a 10-10
deadlock. However, I think we
gained some satisfaction by watch-
ing the WVU fans exit quietly,

knowing this Pitt team should have 

won the game.

Overall, it was an exciting week-
end that showcased a great college
rivalry. Panther fans should be
pleased with our team’s perform-
ance in a hostile atmosphere. We
have the talent and the wins will

' come. Hang in there, Pitt fans, the

Panthers will once again be the
Beast of the East.

..A Portrait of a Rugged American lndividualist

The Pitt News - October 2, 1985’

Fashionable Irreverence/ George Kresak

Prefatory note: Unlike most opin-
ion and editorial columns which are
' intended to persuade the reader to a
particular viewpoint, the following
is little more than an exercise in
mental masturbation. At the time of
its writing, I was possessed by a sin-
gularly mischievous demon and am
v no more to blame for it than I am for
the famine in Ethiopia or
menstruation.

. Howard__has long been one of my
dearest friends. I think that one of
his most endearing traits is his
unblushing honesty. Handsome and
good-natured, he has never pre-
tended to be anything but what he is
— a shallow, cunning and material-
istic miscreant, capable of the most
atrocious acts of deviltry in order to

advance his own interests. Not unex-
pectedly, this disposition has
brought him nothing but power,
wealth and glory.

An eloquent speaker and engag-
ing conversationalist, Howard
naively displays an unexpected
coarseness of mind which is as
refreshing as it is delightful. To his
credit, he is a Philistine and makes
no bones about it. Needless to say,
these qualities put him in great
demand at dinner parties and politi-
cal rallies.

Often at social gatherings, How-
ard — a gentle smile playing lightly
over the delicate features of his ami-
able countenance -— will approach a
stranger with whom he wishes to
gain acquaintance and, with charac-
teristic impudence, will softly pro-
claim his utter contempt for charity

and social justice. Class divisions
please him to no end, and to perpet-
uate them, he has done all that is
within his power. He never misses an
opportunity to belittle those less for-
tunate than himself and often refers
to the poor as “that detestable seg-
ment of our society which defiles us
all if only by its mere existence."
Howard once told me over dinner,
‘‘I am neither witty nor urbane, and
I’m not inclined to read ‘The New
Yorker’ in public places.” The sim-
plicity and artlessness with which he
delivered these lines compelled me
to forgo the pleasure of my usual
after-dinner cognac. More than any-
thing else, it is the directness and
bluntness of his manner that is so
disarming. In his presence, one
instinctively senses the absurdity of
cultured opinion and is seized with

the impulse to quaff crude American
beers in the presence of condescend-
ing foreigners and to blow up the
Museum of Modern Art.

Howard is relentless in his pursuit
of the good life, and the considerable
wealth he has amassed has provided
him the opportunity to indulge his
fancies. He travels frequently and
owns many a sport jacket, numerous
recreational vehicles, a pipe, a ster-
ling tea service and even an Irish
setter. But although his possessions
have been the source of much pleas-
ure, they have not assurd him of the
immortality he so desperately seeks.
This failure is the only source of pain
in an otherwise charmed existence.
The inexorable march of time ﬁlls
him with a cold dread of the
unknown, and he fears that the
afterlife will be not unlike an ideal

Page 5 

socialist commune — a fearfully hel-
lish experience wherein class barri-
ers are non-existent, his elite
position is forfeited, and social har-
mony ﬂourishes.

Postscript: I put Howard forward
as a_role model, a person for all
Americans to emulate. His is a suc-
cess story we can all aspire to. Men
like Howard made America the
great nation it once was. If we wish
to regain America's lost grandeur,
we must once again: learn to cultivate
the attitudes portrayed in this char-
acter sketch. Let's once again be
ruthless and single-minded in our
quest for capital gain.

a... The Exploitation of the Statue of Liberty

WASHINGTON — I keep in my
office a picture of my grandmother
and me standing before the Statue of
Liberty. The picture shows a boy in
short pants, maybe five or six, and
an old woman, stocky and strong, a
peasant who, like millions of others,
first glimpsed the statue as a pas-
senger in steerage. My grandmother
steamed into New York Harbor an
immigrant and walked down the
gangplank an American. For that,
the boy holding her hand has always
been grateful.

It is for that reason that I have
almost a proprietary interest in the

rg‘-Statue of Liberty. I have been fol-

lowing with a somewhat jaundiced
eye the campaign to refurbish it. As
almost everyone knows, the statue is
under repair in anticipation of its
centennial next year. Something like
$230 million’ will be needed. At the
moment, she is girdled with scaffold-
ing and her famous torch rests in a

warehouse where artisans are dupli-
cating it.

I know the exact whreabouts of
the torch from a newspaper ad
placed by the Statue of Liberty/ Ellis
Island Foundation, the group rais-
ing the restoration funds. The ad is
yet another plea for donations ~ “If
you still believe in me, help me finish
the job” — and includes the stand-
ard coupon to check off the amount
of your contribution or, if you see
fit, the number of your Mastercard,
Visa or American Express card.
America did not welsh on its prom-
ise. Emma Lazarus’s “wretched
refuse” now carries plastic.

So far, so good. But in exchange
for" pledging various amounts of
money, participating corporations
have the right to use the statue in
their advertising. Thus, American
Airlines, one of nine official spon-
sors, used the plight of the statue to
announce that if you ﬂew American,

it would make an unspecified dona-
tion to the restoration fund. No
other airline could make that claim,
if only because no other airline gets
to use the Statue of Liberty in its
promotions. Youphave to pay for
that.

If all this sounds vaguely familiar,
it is. It is the same method used to
franchise the Olympics — a system
that resulted in Subaru becoming
the official car ofan American team.
As with the Olympics, the federal
government is leaving everything to
private enterprise. Some companies
pledge money; others pledge serv-
ices. In the Age of the Entrepreneur,
such a scheme is supposed to be

, above criticism — yet another exam-

ple of Americans doing without big,
bad government.

But with apologies in advance to
those firms whose interest in the
statue is wholly unselfish, let me
point out that the Statue of Liberty

is not the Olympics ,— not a game,
not a sport, not entertainment — but
a genuine piece of the national heri-
tage, our Big Ben, our Eiffel Tower
— all of that and more. It should not
be for sale — not to an airline, not to
anyone. Even in the Reagan era,
there have to be some things the
government ought to do for itself.
I suppose that eventually private
enterprise will raise all the money it
needs and the statue will be repaired.
Then everyone will toot a horn to
capitalism, the head of the project
will be mentioned for the Senate
(maybe —- who knows? —— Time
Magazine’s Man of the Year), and
everyone will overlook the fact that
absolutely nothing has been proved.
I hate to think of what would
happen, for instance, if private
enterprise were asked to restore the
Washington home of Frederick
Douglass, the black abolitionist and
newspaper editor. Some H checks

New York and New Jersey are try-
ing to determine which state owns
the island where the Statue of Lib-
erty stands. Common sense asserts
that the island really belongs to
neither state. It belongs to us all. If
that's the case with the island, it's
certainly the case with the statue.
For $253 million, we — our govern-
ment —- ought to be able to spruce
up the statue without franchising
parts of it or allowing it to be used in
the sales of beer, wine or, would you
believe, chewing tobacco.

To millions here and around the
world, the Statue of Liberty is a sym-
bol of America. Refugees waved
their handkerchiefs at it and kids
.like me posed before it with immi-
grant grandparents — a hand hold-
ing the hand that had once held the
waving handkerchief. One old lady
is gone now, but the other endures.
The price for her survival should not
be her virtue.

‘'1 moved to Pittsburgh about
three years ago. I didn ’t need Rand
McNally to tell me it was the No.1
city in the United States. I've lived in
a number of different places but
never have I enjoyed living any-
where as much as I ’ve enjoyed
Pittsburgh.

But the thing that makes Pitts-
burgh a really great town is its peo-
ple. They make me proud to say “I’m
from Pittsburgh."

It was the night the music died.
_Singer-songwriter Gary Vincent’s
final Pittsburgh performance was
held in Thirsty’s bar in north Oak-
land on Saturday evening. And
anyone who has never heard of Gary
Vincent. has never been to Thirsty’s

on a Wednesday night in the past .

three years or to Denny’s bar in
south Oakland on a Thursday night.

There, Vincent would sit atop a
stool equipped with an acoustic gui-
tar, a violin and a repetoire of songs
by artists such as Neil Young, James
Taylor, the Grateful Dead and sev-
eral songs of his own.

It was his ability to draw crowds
and keep them entertained that
landed Vincent his big break. He has

accepted an offer by Tompall Glaser —

to record several of his original
songs. To do this, he has had to relo-
cate to Nashville, Tenn.

However, with all that lies ahead
of him, Vincent admits that he will
miss the city of Pittsburgh.

“Pittsburgh is my home,” he told
the crowd at Thirsty’s on the night of

his final performance. “I was raised:
in Chicago and it never'felt like this,”

he added, before playing a song that
he had written entitled “Good Old
Friend.”

As complimentary champagne
was passed around by the staff of
Thirsty’s, the first Oakland bar that
Vincent performed in, he toasted his
fans in a two-part salute: “_The first
part is to let you all know how much
I’m going to miss everyone. The
second part of this toast is that you
have nothing but happiness and the
time to enjoy it.”

The Pitt News - October 2, 1985

Musician Gary Vincent leaves
area to seek fame in Nashville

“For weeks, ever since he
announced that he would be leaving,
people have been asking when
Gary’s last night would be. It seems
that everybody I wait on asks about
Gary Vincent," said Kathy Burke, a
Pitt. student and waitress at
Thirsty’s. - '

“I’m sorry to'.sce ‘him go,” added
bartender Cathy Linder. “This is the
first and last bar in Pittsburghfor
Gary. I just hope to be first in line
when he headlines in the Civic Arena
or Three Rivers Stadium. He’s as
terrific a person as an entertainer.”

“Anyone who wasn’t there

,shouldn’t be reading this," said

Leroy Anthony, a Pitt graduate stu-
dent. “Gary’s great. He helped break
.up the monotony of the school week.
My roommates and I would come
in, get a pitcher, and listen to him
play a set.”

It all began for the 31-year-old
while attending West. Liberty Col-
lege in Wheeling,W.V. “I was a com-
puter science major my first year,”
explained Vincent. “Then one day I
saw all these music majors sitting
around playing the guitar. I thought
that was pretty neat, so I bought a
guitar, quit computer science and

~ got into music.”

And Vincent got right into music.
Upon graduation, he formed the
Castleman Run Band, which
appeared on a local NBC television
special aired throughout the tri-state
area. The band had a string of hits
on local radio stations in West Vir-
ginia and produced one album.

“That was a real jui..;~ing board
for Gary,” said manager Chris Gen-
drom. After ﬁve years with the band,

Vincent decided to go solo and came .

to Pittsburgh with the help of a girl-
friend. He then began appearing in

_bars near the university, as well as

other locations.

A typical day for Vincent consists
of getting up around noon, drinking
lots of coffee, sitting down with the
guitar for a while and then getting
down to business, which includes a
great deal of time spent on the
phone. His philosophy on life is a
simple one — “do what you want to,
what you enjoy, and be happy.”

When asked how he is able to play
so energetically night after night, he
points to his audience. “The people
keep me going,” be said. “It’s easy to

play night after night when the peo-
ple interact li_ke this."

“He’s as nice as he is talented,”
according to Denny, the owner of
the small south Oakland bar of the
same name, which manages to fill up
quite quickly on the nights Vincent
plays. “He’s the type who's easy to
work with. He’s been playing here
for over a year now. After the first
week he played, it made it much eas-
ier to come to work.” Denny heard
Vincent playing one Wednesday
night at Thirsty’s and knew that he
was perfect for his bar.

Mary Reina, a Pitt student and
loyal Gary Vincent fan, recalls the
first time she heard him play. “I was
walking by Denny’s on a Thursday
night last May, and I heard someone
playing Neil Young. I’ve been a
Thursday night groupie ever since.”

It was at Denny’s that Vincent met
his manager, 25-year-old Chris Gen-
dron. Gendron explained how the
meeting came about. “I was working
on a construction crew and going to
Pitt. One night I talked to Gary, and
he thought I was pretty good. at talk-
ing to people, so he asked me to be
his manager.” ‘

Gendron predicted Vincent’s suc-
cess last April. “I think Gary's future
is in songwriting,” he told The Pitt
News .

“It was a rush performing for all
these people, but it was limited. You
can only ﬁt so many people into
Denny’s,” stated Gendron concern-
ing Vincent’s future possibilities.

Qt-

Vincent’s first album, “Gary Vin- I ‘

cent Underground," contains the
songs that he has written so far,
including two “Charge It” and
“Hangover” — that have found their
way into juke boxes throughout the
country. Perhaps this is just the
beginning. The remaining songs
range from a similiar upbeat country
style to more serene, mellow songs
such as “Mary” and “Scare You
Away,” proof of Vincent’s
versatility.

Pittsburgh will miss Gary Vin-
cent. Bars like Thirsty’s and Denny’s
will definitely miss the crowds that
he would attract,’and his fans will
miss the nights they've spent

. together drinking beer and singing

the songs that made groups such as
Crosby, Stills and Nash, the Band
and Jimmy Buffett famous.

“Some of the volunteers have no grandparents, so
this program gives them the opportunity to ﬁnd out
what they might be like. College students are so
excited about the newness of their life —- they just
bubble over about their new world. We older people
can relate our experiences of school, perhaps our

first day at _college. ”

Dorothy Crutch
YIS TE Program
Generations Together

In a unique extension of Pitt’s and
Generation Together’s Senior Citi-
zen School Volunteer program,
older Pittsburgh residents» and
experts in their fields have started to
work this term as mentors in selected
university departments». -

. Nine senior citizens work directly
with students in the chemistry, phys-
ics, English, German and, Russian
departments, and the pilot program
could be extended to include other
disciplines. .

The Mentor Program enables
retirement-age people to come to
Pitt by the invitation of the faculty
and function as resources for the
undergraduate students.

“We believe the ‘Mentor’ model to
be a unique program in the com-
monwealth. This pilot effort is only
one of several initiatives coming
from the associate provost of under-
graduates office designed to
improve the education of under-
graduate students,” stated Dr. Sally
Newman, director of Generations
Together.

The Mentor Program is only one
of the ways Generations Together
brings elderly and ‘young people
together. Generations Together has
developed eight programs to achieve

. five goals, according to Charles

Lyons, development officer of Gen-
erations Together. “[These goals
aim] to develop new roles for senior
citizens, to increase interactions and
understanding between older and

' younger people, to increase the
learning of young children, to
improve the physical and psycholog-
ical well-being of senior citizens and
to create a bridge between the differ-
ent agencies serving _both
populations."

“Our mission is to develop inno-
vative intergenerational programs,
to research the impact of these pro-
grams on the participants and to
provide technical assistance to other

interested organizations to start pro- -

grams of their own.” stated

Written by Kelly L Shaffer

Newman.

Once a program has been estab-
lished, Generations Together will
study it to evaluate the impact on
both groups. It then takes that infor-
mation and provides it for other
prospective intergenerational
programs.

Generations Together publishes
its developmental processes and
impact studies in related journals, as
well as making them available to
starting programs. Findings are also
disseminated through workshops,
conferences on a national and state
levels, as well as through university
programs.

“Some of the programs that we
have developed have expanded in
the commonwealth and beyond. We
have facilitated programs in New
Jersey, New York and Colorado,”
stated Newman.

“At this time, we have utilized
approximately 2,000 elderly volun-
teers, both well and frail," Newman
explained. “The young people, from
infants to college students, in our
programs approximate 40,000.”

Generations Together has
involved local senior citizens in the
education of young people through
a system of programs that are
intended to develop relationships
between the young and old.

The first program developed was
the Senior Citizen School Volunteer
Program. The elderly person goes to
the elementary school classroom
and works with the students both
individually and collectively. The
volunteer might review lessons, play
learning games or practice math
skills using flash cards.

Another program utilizes the tal-
ents of senior citizens who are artis-
ticallyinclined. It is called the Artist
Resource Program. Volunteers pro-
vide demonstrations or lectures on
their speciﬁc talent. A retired violin-
ist from the Pittsburgh Symphony is
giving violin lessons to individual
students or small groups. A tap
dancer gives a demonstration of the

dance and its rhythms to several
classes within a school. The students
and the volunteers might work on
class projects or study the art
together on a one-to-one basis.

A third program is entitled Cur-
riculum on Aging. The volunteers
design lessons, pamphlets and pro-
jects that explain aging and the older
people in society. “This is to remove
the stigma attached to growing old
and to explain the many positive
points of being among the senior
citizenry of our country,” said
Lyons. This program is designed for
children in the first through sixth
grades, answering questions about
the aging process through guides
and worksheets.

The Child Care lntergenerational
Program involves volunteers in pre-
school and day care facilities. The
children range in age from 6 weeks
old to four or five years of age. The

‘ivolunteers will play with and gener-
ially care for the young children.

9 Youth in Service to Elders is a
program that allows the student to
:help the elderly. Students visit
:elderly or infirmed people, take
‘walks, talk or help “around the
house.”

Pitt students, who are mostly
involved in the YISTE program,

, number 250 to 300 per year. Heather

:Newman, program coordinator,
feels that the students benefit in two
ways. “We provide on-the-job insur-
ance for the student and we will
reimburse them for travel expenses.
These are just the concrete benefits,”
Newman said.

Also, the program promotes the
idea that the students will gain a
broader sense of career options,
work experiences and a sense of
responsibilities.

Gabrielle Marsden, a Pitt student,
has been a YISTE volunteer for two
years. “I visit with Peggy Butler, a
blind girl who’s only a little older
than I am. It took me a while to gain
confidence around her, but the pro-
gram works ~ l‘ve been visiting her

 

' “The program allows you to meet diﬂerent people
and to become friends with them. The students get
insight into the fact that we are people too. We may
have sight problems or handicaps, but we are people

similar to them. ”

Jane Louise Ames

for two years,” stated Marsden.

Jane Louise Ames, a visually
impaired, handicapped resident of
Morehead Towers, has had three
student volunteers visit her during
the three years she has been part of
the YISTE program. “The program
allows you to meet different people
and to become friends with them.
The students get insight into the fact
that we are people, too. We may
have sight problems or handicaps,
but we are people similar to them,”
she stated.

Another Morehead Towers resi-

dent, Dorothy Crutch, is participat-'

ing in the YISTE program. Crutch is
a senior citizen who is visually
impaired. “My volunteers read mail

a or magazines to me; we take walks

and go shopping. We also discuss
our problems of the day,”'she said.

Crutch, who had worked as a pri-
vate nurse and social worker before
retiring, has a volunteer who is from
India. “We talk about hiscountry
and he describes it to me. I try to tell
him about the United States. Some
of the magazine articles that he reads
to me explain things to him also,”
she added. .

“Some of the volunteers have no
grandparents, so this program gives
them the opportunity to ﬁnd out
what they might be like,” Crutch
continued. “College students are so
excited about the newness of their
life — they just bubble over about
their new world. We older people
can relate our experiences of school,
perhaps our first day at college,”

The Elders in Service to At-Risk

‘Youth Program brings together

senior citizens and young people
who are experiencing family/ home
problems. Volunteers visit youth
who are staying in temporary shel-
ters, such as the Mclntyre Tempo-
rary Shelter. The shelter is for
youths who have run away from
home, are removed from their fami-
lies or who have developed problems
with a foster family. '

“The volunteer will take walks,

play games and talk with the young
people. These children have poorly
developed educational, social and
emotional skills. It seems that the
older person provides a sense of self-
esteem and some self-confidence,"
stated Lyons.

The lntergenerational Service-
Learning Program at a Nursing
Home was started two years ago in
conjunction with Butler County
Community College. The college
sponsored a credit-bearing course
which offered theoretical and practi-
cal experience in a care facility. The
student visits with the patients, pro-
viding interaction with the “outside
world as well as encouraging social-
izing within the facility."

Generations Together was begun
in 1978 by Newman, then the direc-
tor of Shady Lane School, an alter-
native schooling facility. She
instigated the Senior Citizen School
Volunteer Program there. i

In l979, Newman was brought to
Pitt by the Long Term Care Geron-
tology Center of the University
(which is no longer existent) to
expand the notion of intergenera-
tional interaction. The program is
now under the auspices of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh's Center for
Social and Urban Research.

“Our models and program are
based on the theory that intergener-
ational interfacing is beneficial to
both populations," said Newman.
"The young learn about aging and
the elderly become involved with a
new generation. It is mutually
beneficial.”

As one-area high school student
volunteer said, “The program is a.
very necessary one to society since
all of us will be elders in the future,
and it is vitally important that each
individual participate in this type of
activity to prevent the boredom and
inactivity of aging.  I encourage
Generations Together to spread this
message further and to begin even

‘more programs for group

participation.”

Chuck Scales excels on and off the
field from endzone to classroom

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

He sits down behind 'a church
piano and his nimble fingers play a
jazz tune to an attentive audience. A
short time later, maybe the next day
or maybe a few hours, he will don
pads and cleats and jog onto a foot-
ball field. His streamlined body will
burst past a defender; he’ll jump
high, and those same nimble ﬁngers
will catch the football for a touch-
down again to an attentive audience.

In short, Chuck Scales is one
impressive individual. Not only is
this 20-year-old University of Pitts-
burgh student the starting ﬂanker
for the football team —— not to'men-

' tion the team’s leading receiver and

scorer — but he also has a 3.0 QPA
within the classes of his major, phys-
ical therapy. If it isn’t enough, he
plays the piano and sings in his
church choir. How does he manage
it all? Not very easily.

“lt’s extremely tough to handle it
all,” Scales said. “I don’t get my
priorities mixed up though. If I have
to study or practice, I won’t let my
music get in the way -— but it seems
somehow that I always find time to
get everthing in.”

Scales grew up in West Mifﬂin
and 4is.the son of former Pittsburgh
Steeler and Cleveland Brown Char-
ley'Sc'ales. With this football heri-
tage, it would seem likely that the
gifted athlete was pushed into play-
ing football, but this is not really
true. .

“My dad never pressured me to
play football," said Scales. “In fact,
he wouldn’t let me play until I was in
the eighth grade, even though I
really wanted to be out there
playing.” _

“Once I started, though, ' he
encouraged me and was like a per- '
sonal coach all the way through high
school and_ even now."

Scales did play football in high
school, earning letters at Shadyside
Academy and gaining Parade All-
America status his senior year as a
running back. But despite all the
yards he gained as a tailback, his

a.

_ biggest gains may have occured in

the classroom.

“Shadyside Academy prepared
me to handle college,” he said. “In
high school, we had a big workload,
and there was always a time limit on
the assignments —- just like there is
now at Pitt.” I

-“That experience really helped me
to handle all those exams and dead-
lines that they throw at you — it
really prepared me.”

Scales has parlayed that educa-
tion into a physical therapy major
and has plans to continue onto med-

ical school after he graduates.

.“I would like to go to medical
school, possibly at Pitt,” he.said.
“And I would like to combine my
major with orthopedics and become
a physical therapist someday.”

Why physical therapy, though?

“The work facinates me,” he
explained. “It is one of the few
health-related professions in which
the doctor really gets to spend time
with his patients. Most doctors only
stay with a patient for a couple of

The Pitt News - October 2, 1985‘ '

Pitt’s east-west martial arts club
teaches fitness, health, and safety

-.‘g.g By William Young

For the Pitt News

The decision to attend a city uni-
versity often leads to another reality
—— city streets. That means possible
muggings, assaults, rapes and devel-
oping a method to defend yourself.
The East-West Martial Arts Club
offers the training for just that pur-
pose: self-defense.

“We’re more oriented to safety on
the streets,” club president Brian
Volpe said. “We give specialized

' ’seminars on Certain techniques and

the use of legal weapons like the
kubaton, and we teach jujitsu.”

This specialization towards self-
defense is one reason many students
are taking the course, especially
since Pitt is a university submerged
in a city setting.

“That was a big reason," said
Doug Bajack, a new member‘ of the
club. “It's a lot rougher down here
than where I used to live.”

“Most people are not aware of the
danger on the streets and the bene-
fits they could gain from training in
the martial arts,” said Curtis Smith,
the group’s director, who is a state

‘ certified policeman and self-defense
- instructor and a third degree black

minutes a day, but a physical thera-

pist works extensively with the
patient ’— sometimes up to three
hours a_day.,,_And I enjoy that.”
But” Scales may have to put his
medical career on holdfor a few
years. The lure of professional foot-
ball looms in his immediate future.
“I think every college football
player wants to play pro ball,” he
said. “After all, you’ve put so much

’f'§work into football and once you get

to this level, you think that you
might as well get paid for what
you’re doing.”

Scales came to Pitt as a highly-
touted freshman tailback. The first
time he touched the football for the
Panthers, he scored a touchdown.

“I never really thought about it
until somebody told me that it was
my first carry,” he said. “I was just
glad I scored because we were play-
ing WVU at the time and it put us

ahead in the game.”

Since then, Scales has been moved .

to ﬂanker and, although he doesn’t

belt. “The club’s purpose is to intro-
duce the student to new and differ-
ent means of defending himself that
the person hasn’t seen before.”

To meet the claim that the club is
street-oriented, it offers two classes
of martial arts instruction each week
plus seminars on certain topics con-
ducted by professionals in the field.
Karate is offered on Tuesdays from
7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and jujitsu is given
from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on
Thursdays. The club qualifies as a
one-credit physical education class
and carries a $45 membership and
instructional fee.

The difference between karate
and jujitsu is easily recognizable in
the regimen of each class. Karate
emphasizes physical endurance and
quick reactions with exercises
geared towards strengthening the
body and building up a tolerance for
pain.

Instruction is given in blocking,
punching, kicking and the various
combinations possible. ‘

“Jujitsu is a combative art form
used primarily for survival based on
opponent manipulation,” Smith

said. The class covers such tech-
niques as taking falls, locating and
utilizing pressure points, executing

ﬂips and throws and blocking
punches and attacks from hand-held
weapons.

Jujitsu is primarily useful in close-
combat situations where someone
may be trying to wrestle you to the
ground or otherwise restrain vou.
For these reasons, Smith empha-
sizesjujitsu over Karate for a person
with a tight schedule.

In addition to class instruction,

"the club also brings in black belts

and other martial arts professionals
to teach special seminars on topics
related to self-defense. The club is
presently planning a seminar on the
use of the kubaton, or the so-called
“persuader baton,” which is a small
metal rod that functions as a.key-
chain and is used in exerting pres-
sure on sensitive parts of the body.

‘ These seminars are open to the pub-

lie at a cost slightly higher than what
the members would pay.
Self-defense is not the only benefit
gained from training in the martial
arts. Coordination and physical fit-
ness are two immediate beneﬁts

- gained through the exercises. Stress

and tension relief are also learned by
special breathing techniques and
some stretching methods.

Classes are held in the Oakland
School of the Performing Arts at
3800 Forbes Ave. .

see the ball as much as the running
backs do, he has no regrets.

“None,” he said. “I enjoy playing
wide receiver, and I think if I had to
go back to playing tailback, I
wouldn’t be too pleased. I’ve
adjusted to the position real well,
and I think I play it pretty well.”

’Well enough, atleast to lead the
Panthers with 15 catches and three
touchdowns after the first four
games. He had four touchdowns in
his last five games, which "include
last year’s ﬁnal game against Penn
State.

“I’d like to believe I’m a big-play
man, but I know that is not necessar-
ily so," he said. “But if the ball is
thrown and I can catch, I feel like
I’m gonna come down with it ——
especially if it’s in the end zone.”

Scales may or may not have inher-
ited his football skills from his
father, but he definitely picked up

his musical talents from his family.
“I taught myself to play the
piano,” he said. “Everybody in my

family — all my three sisters — play
a musical instrument, and I j_ust
learned how to play from listening
and watching them.”.

If you have a chance to watch last
year’s Pitt Panther Football High-
light film, you will see how well he
has learned. He performs in front of
l.hC camera and seems perfectly

calm, which is not surprising
because he also plays for his church
every week, and sings in the church
choir.

“My whole family sings in the
choir,” he said. “It’s just somethingl
enjoy doing.”

Football occupies most of his-time
these days, though. And he still has
several goals for this season.

“I would like to make the All-East

team this year and work toward

being an All-America next year,” he

said. “And, of course, I want our
team not to lose any more games the
rest of the year.”

focus peace institute’s fall classes

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

“Education is a form of activism
because you are becoming more
aware of the world around you,”
said Kathy Guthrie, spokesperson
for the Pittsburgh Peace Institute.
The latest form of educational acti-
vism at the institute is a series of fall
classes.

The Pittsburgh Peace Institute
offers classes that deal with the mod-
cin problems of society. The threat
of nuclear weapons, economic con-
version and the United States policy
on apartheid are discussed, and stu-
dents as well as workers, mothers
and professionals are taught that
they can have the power to change
government policies through the use
of nonviolent pacifism.

“Passive and pacifist mean two
different things,” Guthrie said. “Pas-
sivemeans you don't do anything if
you see that something is wrong.
The pacifist protests against what he
feels is wrong, with noncooperation
and other nonviolent means.”

“Pittsburgh Peace Institute could
be a valid alternative to the ROTC
training that is being taught today at
many universities,” said Guthrie.

Founded in January 1984, the

Activism through education

“Passive and pacifist mean two different things. Pas-
sive means you don ’t do anything, If you see that

something. ”

Kathy Guthrie

Pittsburgh Peace Institute

Zip

Pittsburgh Peace Institute does not
take any political stand or believe in
any one political philosophy.
Through education, the institute
claims it can give people new
insights to old problems such as pov-

erty,- racism and international
violence.
The institute believes» that

although war has always seemed to
be a part of mankind’s history, with
the invention of nuclear weapons
and with them the threat of annihila-
tiona, man must find new alternatives
to avoid war and destruction.

“We must equip people with
information,” Guthrie explained,

“so that they can find the way

toward peace and ‘take a more active
role in making decisions that con-

cern them about their own life.”

According to Guthrie, the threat
of nuclear war forces people to live
in fear, robbing them of their secur-
ity. “I think that people need to feel
secure," she said. “People have the
right to find their security through
nonviolent means.”

The classes that the institute offers
include a class in economics called,
“The Economic Conversion of Pitts-
burgh,“ which considers the historic
relationship between technical
development and Pittsburgh eco-
nomic history, as well as the collapse

.v-

453*:

of the steel industry. The class will ‘

focus. on Pittsburgh's recovery from
the loss of its heavy industry. “Pitts-
burgh is a viable and growing com-
munity," said Guthrie. “We have the

_ potential to become a leader in tech-

nology.” The class will be held in the
Calvary Episcopal Church every
Tuesday from Sept. 24 to Dec. 10,
7:30-9 p.m. ’ .

The instructors of the classes at
the institute, according to Guthrie,
are experts in their field. “The
classes about South Africa in partic-

ular will feature guest lectures by‘

Lucy Websteroof the U.N. Second
Decade to Combat‘Racism and
Racial Discrimination Program.”

Besides the U.N. perspective,
other lectures will discuss the var-
ious problems that South Africa
faces and how it relates to the people
of Pittsburgh.

“Through boycotting South Afri-
can products and learning about the
system of apartheid, people can
bring about social changes in that
country through nonvionlence,”
Guthrie said. The South Africa lec-
ture series .will begin Oct. 2 and
meets on Wednesdays at the First
Baptist Church on the corner of
Bayard and Bellefield streets in
Oakland.

One class, “Peace-making for
Practical People,” is offered at Car-
low College and can be taken for
college credit. The course deals with
the issues of the struggle against
oppression and how the_common
person can protect what he values
through personal and collective
power to defend or change the social
order.

“Most of the students that take_
our courses are in their late twenties ,

and are professional people,” said
Guthrie, “although we don’t just
have professional people involved.
We hope to attract more college-age
people to our- lectures, but we’re not
actively recruiting college-age
people." .

Currently, the Pittsburgh Peace
Institute has 100 members and a
mailing list of 3,000 names.

“There has been an increase in
interest each year, and this is our
second year of having classes,” said
Guthrie. .

Noting that the ideas behind the
Peace Institute seem a little out of
fashion in the ’80s, Guthrie said,
“Nonviolence does not mean sub-
mission to aggression or being pas-
sive. Nonviolence means strength
and courage to find an alternative to
destruction.”

A silver touch

A Olympic
medalist
visits Pitt

Over 100 wide-eyed high school
women’s volleyball players sat in
Trees Hall's-gym on the Pitt campus
last week listening to their hero put
on a clinic. While Debbie Green may
not be a familiar name in the area
among 4 sports fans, she was the‘
Magic Johnson in volleyball for
years. .

"Green was the playmaker and set-
ter qigthe 1984 Women's Olympic
Volleyba'll’Team that won a silver
.rnedal in the summer Olympics,_§he
was a member of the U.S. National‘
Team for seven years before’ retiring
to concentrate on teaching basic
plays to scholastic athletes. Pitts-
burgh is one of approximately 70
stops Green has made in giving five-
hour clinics to high school girls.

“The goal of this clinic,” Green
told the girls, “is for you to leave
here with a better mental picture of
the right way to do things. I can’t
really change bad habits in five
hours, but when I show you the right
way, you will remember it in your
mind.”

Green believes the clinics are
needed to help the girls with their
setting abilities. “A lot of coaches
can teach how to spike,” Green said.
“But many don’t know how to set.
I'll work with each individual, show-
ing them my techniques.” ‘

Green’s techniques "were among
the best in the world throughout the
late 1970s and early 1980s. She
would have participated in the 1980
Olympics had the United States par-
ticipated. It was a tough time in her
life, but she decided to stick it out
and wait for 1984 to arrive.

“I really wanted to quit after
l980,” Green said, shaking her head.

S. Carolina to challenge Panthers  

For yea rs now when people heard
someone say “USC,” the first thing
that came to their mind. perhaps,
was football powerhouse. Well, that
holds true, but now it seems to be for
two different schools. The Univer-
sity of Southern California is what
usually came to mind, but since head
coach Joe Morrison took over at

South Carolina in 1983, “USC" has
taken on a new meaning. The Game-

' cocks have gone from 5-6 in 1983 to

l0-2 last year. This year, playing a
tougher schedule, the Gamecocks
are 2-2 withlosses to Michigan and
Georgia. .

“The primary difference between
this year’s ball club and last year’s is
that we had 23 seniors graduating,"
said Morrison of this year’s club.
“Last year, we had people returning
at almost every spot offensively, and
I think seven returning defensively.
This year you don’t have that.” Mor-
rison added, “You make a change on
a year to year basis, and that is the

back Dan Marino evolved

difference right there."

It was last year’s team that scored
17 fourth quarter points on the way
to a 45-21 blowout of the Panthers.
Quarterback Mike Hold replaced
Allen Mitchell and directed the
Gamecocks to victory. This year,
both are back, but Hold has sur-
faced as the starter. Through four
games, Hold has completed 50 per-
cent of his passes while throwing for
three touchdowns. Last week
against Georgia, Hold completed 17
of 26 passes for 238 yards in the
losing effort. '

“I thought (Hold) had a real fine
ballgame last‘ week against Geor-
gia,” said Morrison. “He's been
playing well all year long and we
tried to get Allen in the ballgame,
but we never really felt we were in a’
position where we could put Allen in
the ballgame.”

It seems that Hold has solidified
his hold on the quarterback job.

“He can run with the ball, and be

has really great scrambling ability,’
said Morrison. “He makes some-
thing happen.”

Beyond Hold, the Gamecocks
have more quality players. Running
back Thomas Dendy and Kent
Hagood have been averaging close
to six yards per carry so far this sea-
son, and when the Gamecocks run
the ball, something they have done
twice as much as they have passed,
Dendy and Hagood are strong choi-
ces to get the ball.

“Kent is a fine running back,
along with Thomas Dendy,” said
Morrison. “We feel that is one ofour
stronger positions. We feel we have
good backs." .

Dendy has 236 yards rushing this
year while Hagood has added 227
yards. They present a challenge for
the Pitt defense, currently ranked
eighth in the nation against the rush
with a 77.3 yards allowed per game
average.

before hordes of delirious Dol-Fans.
Now, the Dol-Fans have seen and
praised a city kid, a product of
fiercely insular south Oakland. He is
viewed by many as the Wonder Kid,
the savior. Travel a few thousand
miles north of that frantic aquarium
and you arrive at the boyhood home
of Daniel Constantine Marino Jr.

Inside his home, you can’t help

but notice picture after picture of his
accomplishments. Hanging in uni-
form fashion are photos of this
young man passing his way to the
tops of NFL charts. These accom-
plishments didn’t come easily. Ask
Dan Marino Sr., the very proud
father of this wonder kid.

“Dan loved to practice. I had a lot
of time towork with him so we both
enjoyed, it. I used to tell him_ that
you’re the only one who knows your
own potential. have to utilize
these talents-vol‘ you’ll be cheating
yourself.”

Not only has Dan Marino Jr. util- .
ized his talents but he has done so at-

a record pace.

At a height of 6-4 and weighing
215 lbs. he’s strong and agile enough
to survive out of the pocket. Because
of his quick release of the ball, he’s
able to frustrate defensive players,
who see him avoid a near-sack with a
mere Jlick of his wrist, then watch
the ball travel 2-5 yards on the line
without a wobble. Marino obviously
has reduced this game to a matter of
pass and catch. His ﬁeld vision is a
gift, plain and simple.

Quite frankly, Marinojust doesn’t
make many mistakes. In less than
two seasons, only 3 percent of his
passes have been intercepted.
Remarkably, Marino goes about
destruction so easily, so calmly, so
naturally, that you forget he was in
college just three years ago. And you
forget that he is confronting com-
plex defenses that are employing
every possible strategy to confuse
the young lad. All this is happening
in front of swarms of fans.

All of Dan’s accomplishments fail
to surprise Dan Sr. “I told Dan when

he was growing up that you can

make or break yourself. You can’t
let the fans bother you. You can’t
play every down like it’s your last.”
He went on to add, “No fan’s opin-
ion ever made a first down. You
should just go out there and do your
job.”

Doing the job is exactly what the
younger Marino has been doing.
Actually, he’s been creating head-
aches for many defensive coordina-
tors throughout the NFL.

As a senior at Pittsburgh, he
became involved in a miniature
nightmare. Touted as a possible
Heisman Trophy winner, he instead
threw 23 interceptions. He wasn’t
comfortable in a new offense that
emphasized short patterns and quar-
terback readsinstead of the old let-
it-fly routes of his previous three
years.‘ Pitt fell out of national con-
tention quickly, and for the first
time, he heard boos in his hometown
and read criticism in the local press.

Dan’s father pointed out that the
quarterback is the center of atten-
tion. “The quarterback takes both
the good and the bad,” he said. “Dan
knew going in that the quarterback
has to face lots of criticism. He
played quarterback most of his life
so he knew what to expect.”

Actually, Pitt was an excellent
choice for a quarterback serious
about his future. Under Jackie Sher-
rill and later Foge Fazio, the Pan-
thers ran a pro-style offense in which
Marino threw some 1,200 passes.

Marino, sixth quarterback
selected in the first round, was
rewarded with a $2 million contract.
Since then he has added a growing
list of endorsements. His curly hair,
boyishly handsome face and spark-
ling blue eyes are featured on a pos-
ter in which he is dressed in a tuxedo,
holding a football, with the Miami
skyline in the background. He has
many other endorsement packages,
which include Pepsi-Cola (with Joe
Montana); MacGregor Sporting
Goods (a new line of footballs); Aris
Isotoner (gloves); Chevrolet (ads

and promotions) and Pony Sports &

Leisure lnc. (cleated and leisure
shoes).

It has been just seven seasons
since Dan Marino collected rocks on
a parochial high school ﬁeld. Dan
Sr. remembered: “At the time, Cen-
tral Catholic was building a new
gymnasium. The construction
created a mess of rocks and ruts over
the practice field, so at the end of
practice each day, everyone had to
fill up his helmet with rocks. When
you were finished, you went in for a
shower.”

Even as a toddler, this Marino lad
had ball on his mind. Mrs. Marino
recalls: “When Dan was about two
years old he would point to a light
bulb and say ‘Ball, ball!"” This boy
must have loved “ball” because as he
grew up, as his father said, he loved
to practice.

Daniel Constantine Marino, first-
born child of Dan and Veronica
Marino, received his first nerf foot-
ball at the age of two, and from there
he matriculated across the street to
St. Regis Elementary, where he was
a‘ fourth-grade water boy. '

“I knew I still enjoyed playing,
though. And with the 1984 Olympics
being in southern California, where
I’m from, I never would have for-
given myself if I didn’t participate."

With Green making her decision
to remain on the squad after the
boycotted 1980 Olympics, it was
back to hard work. The team prac-
ticed six to eight hours every day,
working on skills, getting in the right
shape and most importantly, work-
ing as a team.

“We all had apartments together

from California moved there and all
we did was play volleyball.”

Green and teammates knew it
would take four years of hard work
just to get into the Olympics. The
odds were against the team as only
the 1980 team qualified for the
Olympics.

Under new head coach Arie Selin-
ger, the team started improving. One
month after he took the reins, the
squad moved from 12th to 5th in the
world.

“We watched and watched the
techniques of the Japanese, Chinese
and Russians,” Green said. “They
were the best in the‘ world. We have
to work so much harder trying to
catch up to the other countries
because they have so many youth
volleyball programs over there. Still,
Japanese sixth graders could beat
most U.S. high school teams.”

Green, with her excellent setting
work, led the team into the Olym-
pics, surprising many along the way.
In the preliminaries of the Olympics,
Team U.S.A. shocked China, giving
the team hope of winning a gold
medal. However, the team was
defeated by the Chinese in the gold
medal game.

“We gave it everything we had,”
said Green. “It was great getting so
much television coverage and hav-
ing the pleasure of playing in your
‘hometown and country.”

The days of playing in front of
huge crowds in the Long Beach
Sports Arena are over now. But
Green is still where she loves to be —
on a volleyball court. The pint-sized
woman with her black hair in a
ponytail had the girls going over all
parts of the game. “Hit your serves
like this," she said to one, demon-
strating the correct motion. The vol-

leyball players’ coaches anxiously _

took notes.

Washington, McGuffe and
Greenville women’s teams were on
hand with others, realizing Green’s
clinic would help their team. “I
really enjoy doing this,” Green says
with a bright smile. “It's fun to give
something back to the game.”

Nora Mulvihill

This week’s athlete of the week,
when asked to review her perfor-
mance in the past tournament
stated, “I thought I played more
consistently than I have previously.”

Freshman Nora Mulvihill helped
lead the Lady Panthers to a 16-3
slate and the championship of their
own tournament. Mulvihill was also
one of three Pitt players selected to
be on the all-tournament team.
Coach Collier noted, “This was a
significant achievment for Nora, as a
freshman, to make the all-
tournament team. We’ve been work-
ing hard to develop a stable team
attitude. Nora has made excellent
strides. Hopefully, this is a sign of
things to come.”

Mulvihill, a 5-] l middle-setter out
of Norwin High School, was one of
the most highly recruited volleyball
players in the state. She was voted
the No. l playerin Pennsylvania and

made Volleyball Monthly Maga-
zine's Elite Fabulous 50 poll last sea-
son, a distinction that no other
player in the state made. While at
Norwin, Mulvihill led the team to
the Quad A state title. Sherron Wat-
son, Mulvihill’s high school coach,
pointed out, “Nora is not lazy nor
does she take things for granted.
She’s a very good athlete and intelli-
gent. She’s got a goodjump, is quick
and her height is a definite plus.
She's worked to develop all aspects."

Since arriving at Pitt, Mulvihill

has had her work, for the most part,
out out for her. First on Collier’s
priority list was to replace All-
America Ulana Kuhutiak. Mulvihill
has filled those shoes nicely. She
paced Pitt in the Pitt Invitational
Tournament with 34 kills. She also
turned in some impressive serving
and blocking stats.

Because Mulvihill was so heavily
recruited, a lot was expected of her.
she certainly displayed the talent
and ability in high school. Mulvihill

said of her transition to playing col- ,

lege volleyball, “lt’s more relaxing
for me to play at Pitt. 1 have more
liberties here. The game is more ﬂex-
ible, and ifl make a mistake, I am
more relaxed with that. Now that I
am more used to playing college vol-
leyball, I am comfortable with my
role. The team is starting to relate
well with each other and our game is
jelling.” -

The tournament being Pitt’s first
home stand, the crowd turn-out was
a sizable one. Mulvihill stated, “It
was fun to play this weekend. We
had a very large, supportive crowd
and it fired up the team. Sue
(Hoover) helped me a lot because
she was so fired up for the win. I
played very well because Sue played
well and was ready. to win.”

The Lady Panthers travel to Penn
State Saturday at 2 p.m. to play
what could well be the decisive game
dictating how the rest of the season

 

 

   

will turn out. The game will be an
excellent one because of the Nittany

Lions’ caliber of action so far this 1'

season.

For Nora Mulvihill, the game
means a little more. When she was
making her final decision as for"

whom she would play, it came down ‘

to Pitt and Penn State. She agreed
with her coach, “Penn State will be a
pivotal point this season. If we win,
we will have gained a lot of confi-
dence. On the other hand, a loss

could make us slide a little, forcing .

us to work harder on our game. I’m
definitely psyched to play.”
Volleyball Notes:
Panthers travel to Penn State Satur-
day at 2 p.m. PSU has a strong pro-
gram this year and will be tough.
Sunday afternoon, the Georgetown

The Lady ‘

Hoyas will play host to Pitt. The -

‘ Hoyas have improved vastly and, as
they stand now, pose a threat not to
be toyed with lightly. Sunday’s tour-,
nament MVP was Pitt junior Sue
Hoover.

_ Honorable Mention: A. B; Brown,
the sophomore tailback on the
Panther football team, got- his first
collegiate start against West Virgi-

nia on Saturday. Filling in for an '

injured Charles Gladman, Brown
gained 105 yards on l6 carries. He

also broke off the longest run from .

far this year, a 38-yard run in the :

second half.

NFL Roundup

Bears proving themselves

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

0The Chicago Bears, off to their
best start since 1963 (4-0), are
quickly becoming the NFL’s'newest
juggernaut. After routing former
kingpin Washington on Sunday 45-
10, Mike Ditka’s grizzlies have made
it clear to the rest of the league that
they are viable contenders for the
Lombardi Trophy. Chicago’s unpre-
dictable offense exploded for 31
second quarter points, highlighted
by a 99-yard kickoff return by
speedster Willie Gault and a 13-yard
touchdown pass from Walter Pay-
ton to quarterback Jim McMahon.
The Bears are indeed the hottest
thing in the Windy City since the
Great Fire.

0The NFL’s only other unde-
feated team, the L.A. Rams,
bounced Atlanta 17-6 despite a first-
half injury to running back Eric
Dickerson. Ram quarterback Dieter
Brock finally displayed his reputed
passing ability, throwing for 215
yards and two touchdowns. The Fal-
cons hoped to overcome a 10-3 half-
time deficit by inserting backup
quarterback Dave Archer into the
lineup, but the Iowa State grad was
only able to direct his offense to a
third-quarter field goal.

Oln an unrealistic upset, the New
Orleans Saints defeated the mighty
San Francisco 49ers 20-17 in Can-
dlestick Park. Joe Montana, QB of
the 49ers, experienced perhaps his
poorest day as a pro, completing
only 12 of 26 passes for 120 yards.
Former Pitt linebacker Rickey Jack-
son proclaimed, “Today, man for
man, we were better than the 49ers,”

Along with the loss to the Saints, the
’Nin_ers have also been defeated this
season by the rejuvenated Minne-
sota Vikings. These two doormats
celebrated a common total of 10
wins in 1984, five less than the 49ers.
So goes the Parity Parody.

0Both the Chiefs and the Raiders
of the AFC West were able to
bounce back from losses two Sun-
days ago. Kansas City ripped highly
touted Seattle 28-7 behind four
interceptions by safety Deron
Cherry, and the Raiders scored three
defensive touchdowns while bang-
ing New England 35-20. Raider
quarterback Marc Wilson injured
an ankle early in the third quarter
and was replaced by rookie Rusty
Hilger. Although he wasn’t particu-
larly impressive in his debut, Hilger
could be a good one.

0The Washington Redskins are in
serious trouble. The team owns a
sour l-3 record and is quite unhappy
with the play and overall attitude (as
well as the punting) of Joe Theis-
man. In Sunday’s game.with Chi-
cago, the former all-pro passed for
little over 200 yards and no touch-
downs. Substituting for injured pun-
ter Jeff Hayes, Theisman
contributed to the Chicago cause
with a kick that netted one yard.
“Hail to the Redskins” is no longer
on the NFL’s hit list.

0The Dolphin-Bronco game was, '

as expected, the weekend’s best. Dan
Marino was his usual outstanding
self, passing for 390 yards and three
touchdowns for a 30-26 victory. The
Miami defense did surrender 395
total yards to John Elway’s unit, but
stiffened during the fourth quarter,
when the game was on the line. Dol-

phin safety Bud Brown was the de-
fensive hero, contributing 12 tackles
and a game-ending interception to
the effort.

0Jim Kelly, Buffalo’s No. 1 draft
choice in 1983, was a spectator at
Sunday’s Minnesota-Buffalo game
in Orchard Park, NY. The USFL
quarterback reportedly had met
with the Bills’ general manager
Terry Bledsoe. No details of the
meeting were released, but some-
thing may be brewing in Buffalo.
Kelly could really help this strug-
gling franchise, which lost to the
Vikings 27-20.

0Charger quarterback Dan Fouts
injured his right knee in the team’s
21-7 loss to Cleveland. If Fouts is
lost for the season, the only thing
that may save San Diego would be a
strike by the NFLPA.

Since the Chargers are the point
of focus, one further comment:
Doesn’t the San Diego management
realize that defensive coordinator
Tom Bass, despite his massive
frame, is capable of being fired just
like any other assistant coach? Bass
very well may be the “force” behind
the Chargers’ forceless defense.

OFinally, Pete Axthelm of NBC’s
“NFL ’85” appears to have changed
his on-camera behavior. This sea-
son, “The Ax” has taken a much
more serious attitude toward the
game and has made several fine
picks, his most recent being Kansas
City’s romp over the Seahawks.
During the past several ‘years,
Axthelm _had become unbearably
corny, bordering on idiotic. One bit
of advice to football fans: Watch
Larry King’s spot on “NFL ’85." He
is outstanding,\a true professional.

Tom follows John’s steps

By Brooks Thomas

For the Pitt News

Tom Brown takes a back seat to
Charles Gladman in the University
of Pittsburgh football picture, but
smiles just the same. Gladman was
the story behind the early success of
the Pitt Panthers. During the first
three games, Gladman thrilled
crowds with his dazzling I00-yard
performances. After each game his
lockerwas the center of attention as
numerous reporters patiently awa-
ited their chance to interview the Pitt
halfback.

On the other side of the locker
room, fullback Tom Brown sat on a
stool in front of his locker away
from all of the commotion, resting
his aching body. It was a very physi-
cal game that afternoon as one can
observe by the bumps and bruises
visible on his arms. Brown glances
over at his running mate’s locker and
smiles. Deep inside, he knows that
he had a successful game and knows

  
   

that his performance will be over-
shadowed by Gladman‘s in tomor-
row’s paper, but it doesn’t bother

him as he goes to the showers’

unnoticed.

“Tom is the best fullback I have
ever, ever played with,” Gladman is
quick to point out to the reporters.
“I couldn’t have done it without
him.”

Brown, a junior form Lower Bur-
rell, is also playing in the shadows of
his older brother, John, who will
always be remembered for his last
minute game-winning touchdown
catch in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. John
is currently a member of Coach
F oge Fazio’s staff and is fulfilling his
dream of being a coach.

“I’m very proud of my brother’s
accomplishments,” Tom said. “I've
always looked up to him and I am
very proud of him. He is going to be
an excellent coach someday and I
am glad we’re together.”

The fullback position is very sim-

cl... Palla/The Pitt News

ilar to that of an offensive lineman’s T

in that both open the holes for the A

halfback but rarely ever get any of
the credit. “Every time Charles
breaks a big run, I like to feel that I
was part of it,” explained Brown
while he attentively views films of his
upcoming opponent. “Whenever I
throw a good block, it gives me a
great deal of satisfaction. We run-
ning backs have a pact. Whatever
individual honors that one of us
receives, we all share.”

The former Burrell, High School
star was recruited very heavily as a
running back and linebacker by
West Virginia, Ohio State, Michi-
gan, North Carolina and Pitt. “The
University of Pittsburgh offered me
everything,” said Brown. “It was not
only close to my home, but I thought
that I fit in best with the people.
They were the most sincere.”

Brown is pursuing a history
degree and has entertained thoughts
of attending graduate school. When
he isn’t working on football, Brown
enjoys going out and shooting a
round of golf with his friends.

Football season is a very hectic
time of the year for the Brown
household. Every Friday night it’s
off to Burrell High School to watch
Jim, the youngest of five sons, and
on Saturday afternoons the family
and friends head for Pitt Stadium to
watch Tom and John. “I know I
speak for my whole family in saying
we’re very proud of Tom,” said
John. -

Another person who is as equally
impressed with Tom is his running
back coach, Andy Urbanic. “Tom is
a very dedicated athlete and is a
pleasure to have around. He is one
of those rare breeds of punishing
running backs who will hurt you but
at the same time he possesses good
speed and quickness. Tommy is an
integral part of our running attack,
and any success that we have with it
can be partly attributed to him.”

Brown’s name may not appear in
the headlines but it doesn’t bother
him. He knows his role and is very
happy with it. “My job is to block for
Charles,” said the 6-1, 225 lb. full-
back. “It’s easy to block for a great
back like Charles. He hits the hole so
quick and makes me look good. I
just want to go out every week and
try my hardest. As long as the team
stays together and works hard, I’ll be

very happy.”

As I see it ’    

Bucs team of future has a strong foundation

“... a kind of baseball that none of
us had ever seen before — throwing
and running and hitting at some-
thing close to the level of
perfection. "

—Roger Angel],
on Roberto Clemente

It was indeed Roberto Clemente
and other former Pirates who laid
the foundation for the Pirates’ cur-
rent attendance problems. Pitts-
burgh has seen more great players
than any other major city, with the
possible exception of New York.

, Clemente, along with the likes of

Honus Wagner, Pie Traynor, Ralph
Kiner, Paul Waner, Arky Vaughn,
Fred Clarke, Max Carey, Willie
Stargell and Kiki Cuyler have
spoiled Pirate fans.

The Homestead Grays and Pitts-
burgh Crawfords of the Negro
Leagues did not exactly help the
situation, either. Oscar Charleston,
Judy Johnson, Smoky Joe Will-
iams, Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard
and Jimmie Crutchfield were among

‘the best that the Negro Leagues (or

any other league, for that matter)
ever produced. Then there are per-
haps the two greatest players in
Pittsburgh history, Leroy “Satchel"
Paige and Josh Gibson.

The long history of all-time greats
in this city has the fans expecting
more all-time greats every time the
Pirates take the field. We have won
one world championship in the last
six years. How many other teams
can say that?

We, the fans, have to be more
patient. I pray that the Pirates don’t
leave Pittsburgh because, besides
being a baseball fan in general, I
think that the Pirates will contend
for the divisional crown as soon as
1987. We have all heard enough
teams say that they are a team of the
future. But those claims were usually
based on one or two players. Base-
ball is a team game, and the Pirates
are slowly but surely building a
promising foundation.

At one point, the New York Mets
were going through the same prob-
lems that the Pirates are experienc-
ing now. Manager Casey Stengel, in

 

Chuck Tanner ponders the future of the Pirate.

one of his most famous quotes, bel-
lowed, “Can’t anybody here play
this game?!"

In 1969, just a few short years
later, they won the World Series
over the Baltimore Orioles four
games to one. Could the Pirates be
the next “miracle team”? Ya gotta
believe!

What more can be said about
Tony Pena? He has the best arm of
any catcher since Manny San-
guillen. His offense doesn’t match
that of Gary Carter and Lance Par-
rish, but every time that an enemy
runner takes off on a steal attempt,
I’m on the edge of my seat. I love the
commercial that ends with, “Tony
Pena, comin' to a ballpark near

' you.” What an arm!

The arms (of the pitching staff)
have been the Pirates’ problem as of
late. But this once again looks to be a
strong point in a very short time. A
lot depends on the future of Rick
Reuschel. One more year, please.
The Pirates’ AAA team Hawaii lead
the Pacific Coast League in pitching
this year. Rick Rhoden has a few
good years left ahead of him, but
these young Pirates arms have a lot
of good years left. Finding two or
three other starters to go with Reu-
schel and Rhoden should not be a
difficult task. '

Jose DeLeon is not nearly as bad
as his win-loss record would indi-
cate. He needs to get more support
from his teammates, not only offen-
sively but defensively_as well. It’s
almost as if all of the Pirates save up
their errors until it is DeLeon’s turn
to pitch. Lee Tunnell has been the
classic up-and-down pitcher. If he
can continue to have more “ups,” he
could be one of the other starters.
Also making a run at the regular
rotation are Bob Kepper, who has
shown ﬂashes of potential, and Bob
Walk, who is probably the Pirates’
best starting pitcher prospect. Walk
has led the PCL in ERAS the last two

seasons (2.26-2.65).

I think that the Pirates should
hand the long-reliefjob to Mike Bie-
lecki next spring and let him stay
there no matter what. If they are
patient, it will pay off in the long
run. All Bielecki needs is confidence.
Pat Clements has shown that he can
be one of the team’s short-relief men,
but they still lack the big stopper.
Ray Krawczyk led the PCL in saves
this year and posted a 2.26 ERA. He
should be given the early shot next
year.

While he is probably the imme-
diate future of the bullpen, the long
range big stopper is on the way.
Barry Jones has absolutely domi-
nated Class A and Class AA ball in
his brief but promising career. If his
success continues at Hawaii, it won’t
be long before he is given his shot at
the big time.

The future of the Pirates at first
base is Sid Bream. Look for Jason
Thompson to be the next veteran
shipped out. Bream has hit .343 and
.370 in his last two minor league sea-
sons. He has also shown great poten-
tial for the power that the Pirates so
desperately need. And considering
his age" (25) and height (6-4), his
weight (215 lb.) could get even
higher.

Johnny Ray is a consistent every-
day player at second base. Before

. long, Ray could actually be the old-

est among the eight starters.
Sammy Khalifa is the best short-
stop_m this city since Gene Alley,
and in time could surpass him. I’m
asking the fans to remember that
most shortstops do not win eight
batting titles (Honus Wagner). Most
don’t even hit like Cal Ripken Jr. or
Alan Trammell. So don’t complain

about Khalifa’s low average. He’

provides the kind of defense that is
only topped by Ozzie Smith. Give
him time, he’s only 21 years old.
The Pirates have to look for a new
third baseman. I’d like someone who

  

  

 

    

  
  
   

By Jim Brueckner

would supply good defense and hita
few home runs. A young Craig Net-
tles type would be perfect. In the
minor leagues, there are currently
perhaps more good third base pros-
pects than any other position. A
trade package involving Jason
Thompson and Larry McWilliams
could net a few offers.

Bill Almon and Denny Gonzales
will provide a good bench.

l’m against platooning out-
fielders. How about rotating four of
them? The Pirates are three-quarters
of the way there. RJ. Reynolds will
be an all-star within four years.
Every one of his errors this season
has been because of being overly
aggressive. He is an extremely tal-
ented competitor, and the Pirates
are fools if they don’t stick with him
all the way through next season.

Joe Orsulak is not ﬂashy, but he is
consistent. He gives the Pirates a
good bat and speed on the baseline.

The Pirates’ fourth outfielder
should be a real speedburner. They
need a basestealer. It just so happens
that he may be on the horizon in the
form of Barry Bonds (son of Bobby).

Mike Brown is slow and has a
glove that is best describedas aver-
age, but he has one of the best young
arms in baseball and a great bat.. He

V will be a consistent .300 hitter.

When one calls the Pirates a team
of the future, it is not based on one
or two “saviors.” They have a good
solid base from which to build.

It could get to a point where when
the fans see the Pirates play in the
near future, they will echo the words
of Ernie Banks: “Let’s Play Two!”

Buczkowski another top Pitt

defensive lineman

By Kirk Swauger

For The Pitt News

It is located on the edge of Penn
State territory, a pink wooden struc-
ture, a shot-and-beer bar known as
The Fireside. Its customers spend
their autumn weekends cheering for
Joe Paterno and D.J. Dozier and
Michael Zordich, for the boys from
State College. “We want Penn State
to win," a middle-aged man said as
he drank a beer at the bar, “but we
also root for Bob Buczkowski.”

A blue and gold Pitt banner
drapes one of the walls, declaring,
“Pitt No. I.’’

It is there, Bob and Diane Bucz-
kowski insist, because they are the
owners of this New Kensington
drinking establishment, and their
son, Bob, plays football at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

“Most people at the bar like to see
Pitt win during the year, until Pitt
plays Penn State,” Mrs. Buczkowski
said. “Then they cheer for Penn
State. But they always want Bob to
play well.”

The Buczkowskis are down-to-
earth parents, hard-working par-
ents, caring parents. They have seen
football give Bob an opportunity for
a college education, a cherished
opportunity since, as Mrs. Bucz-

kowski said, “It would have been
very hard for us to send him to
school.”_

“Without my parents, I would be
nothing,” said Bob Buczkowski, a
Monroeville native and Gateway
High School graduate.

Mrs. Buczkowski sat at a table
inside The Fireside and glanced
through a scrapbook of her son's
career. Through the years she had
clipped articles of Bob’s accomplish-
ments in Little League, midget and
high school football, track and field
and, needless to say, stories about
his football success and Big East
shot—put championship at Pitt.

“He’s the perfect kid,” said Mrs.
Buczkowski. “He’s very easy going.
He's such a nice person. If you sit
down and talk with him, and then
watch him play football, he is just
the opposite."

Rick O'Connor, Bob’s uncle, is
the man responsible for guiding Bob
through his early years in sports. He
watched him as often as possible
and, like a father, spent time tossing
a ball in the evening.

“Bob could have been anything he.
wanted, baseball, basketball, foot-
ball. He’s a natural athlete,”
O’Conner said. “He’s so hard-
headed, he’ll stay with something
until he beats you. If Bobby doesn't

get it right, he’ll keep trying until he
does.”

Bob Buczkowski, on the football I

field, has been compared to former
Pitt defensive tackle Bill Maas, now
a star with the Kansas City Chiefs.
They were both big, strong, intimi-
dating linemen.

“Bob has a chance to become one
of the fine tackles at Pitt,” defensive
line coach Sal Sunseri said. “He‘s a
big play type person. If he stays
healthy, he will be a good choice in
the draft.”

His progress has been hampered
in his first three years at Pitt by
injuries. He sprained his ankle in his
sophomore season. He hurt his
shoulder as a junior. He has been
labeled as having potential, a repu-
tation not always complimentary.

“I hope this is the year Bob Bucz-
kowski finally comes through,” he
said. “l’ve waited long enough. It’s a
matter of me coming around. I want
to play the best I can this year.”

* He has started the first twoigames,
making 12 tackles, three for losses.
He is one of the reasons the Pitt
defense is ranked among the best in
the nation against the rush;

His friends at The Fireside are
proud. “All the guys up at the bar are
for me," Buczkowski said, smiling.
“Good guys.” ‘

continued from page 11

“We are concerned with the speed
they have on offense,” noted Pitt
head coach Foge Fazio yesterday. It
was that same speed that gave the
Panthers trouble last year. Dendy
and Hagood both scored last year
against the Panthers, Dendy on a

43-yard run.”

So it may once again be up to the
Panther defense to stop this South
Carolina attack. Last week, Pitt put
forth maybe their best defensive
effort of the season against West
Virginia.

“We had some good things and
some bad things,” said Fazio of the
backyard brawl. “The good things

we have to improve on and the bad
things we have to eliminate.”

The time to start improving is this
weekend.

The sporting life

, ‘ The Pitt News - October 2,1985

By Bob Travers

Cross country is a sport where you only get personal satisfaction

We live in an age in which heroes
seem to be made to be broken. We
love nothing more than to see, as the
songs says, “the hero take a fall." It
satisfies us in some way, and we are
reassured that in an imperfect world,
there are no real supermen. Start a
rumor, create a scandal, anything to
bring down those whom we call
great.

Among those of us who followed
the Pittsburgh baseball-cocaine
trial, there was a hint of self-
righteousness along the lines of,
“Well, so maybe I’m not a great
baseball player, but at least I'm not
some lousy junkie.” And our heros
take a fall.

Yet even with all the cynicism
regarding sports today, amid the
lying, cheating and drug abuses,
there is still one light that shines for

me. There is one person at least who
competes only for the sheer joy of
the sport. This person is not some-
one you have heard of, but her story,
simple though it is, is one that needs
to be told.

Her name is Erin, and she is a
cross-country runner at a small
school in eastern Pennsylvania.
She'll never get a scholarship for her
athletic ability; she’ll never win the
Heisman Trophy and sign a multi-
million dollar contract with any-
body, and never will her races be on
national television. So why does she
do it?

Why get up for morning practice
at 6 a.m. (including weekends) and
punish her body over‘ lonely miles of
tree-lined roads? What's the use; and
why would anybody in his right
mind do this?

There are no benefits that the out-
side observer can see, and this con-
fuses the non-athlete. But inside the
athlete there exists the uniquejoy of
competing — of putting yourself up
against another in an attempt to beat
him at whatever it is you are compet-
ing in.

Watching Erin in a race is seeing

‘ sport in its purest form. There is no

reason for her to win other than the
desire to be better — better than the
other runners, better than she was
before. There are no shoe company
endorsements waiting for her at the
finish line, only the bittersweet pain
of knowing she pushed her body to
its physical limit. It is that numbing
sense of having done your very best
that all true athletes know. It is a
most personal feeling, one that can
never be shared, but one worth all

One of the most important attrib-

to quit. Never under any circum-
stances is the race to be given up. As
long as there is the remotest chance
to win, an athlete cannot quit.

Erin has never given up, and being
a true athlete, she never will.

Back in her freshman year in col-
lege Erin was, like most students,
having a very hard time adjusting to
her new world. She went to college

alone, knowing no one there. She

joined cross-country and somehow
made the team among the more
experienced runners there. That was
a long shot in itself. In her first few
races she finished nowhere near the
top. But she did not quit. .

lete. The spirit that has been passed

that is supposed to light the Olympic
flame. That it doesn’t sometimes
only means that true athletes are no
longer what the Olympics are all
about.

It also means that we have to look

rder to find that spirit. We won't
find it on the fields in stadiums
around the world; those people are
not athletes so much as they are
entertainers. Take away the finan-
cial incentive and see how many men
of 26 years still choose to play base-
ball, football, basketball or hockey
for a living. How many ofthese per-
formers would be around ifthe aver-
age salary ofa pro athlete was $4,500
a year?

No, that is not where the athletic
spirit burns. The true athletes are
performers for themselves only, try-
ing to be the best to impress only
themselves. For the athlete this is all
the reward that is necessary.

Marino
continued from page 12

Water boy no more, in fifth grade.
he became quarterback and by
eighth grade, was sharing the duties
with Joey Carcia.

Dan’s father was coach at the
time. “We would use Dan in the first
half and Joey in the second half,” he
said. Both of Dan’s parents enjoyed
watching their son grow up.

“His father knew there was some-
thing special about him even when
he was younger,” said Mrs. Marino.

Now, Marino has the capability to
turn over every offensive passing
record ever made. This is a man who
used to shovel snow as a young boy
in Oakland. He can now toil with
NFL opponents as he passes his way
toward a luminous future.
