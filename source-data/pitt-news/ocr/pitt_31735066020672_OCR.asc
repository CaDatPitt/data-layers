", When I. was depressed, I had two V

faces. The times when I had to go
out, 1 had to appear normal and do
the normal things. But at home it
was completely different. The worst
part was just getting out of bed in the
morning. I didn't want to face the
day. I thought about suicide at least
three times. The only reason I'm

alive today is because of my Roman _

Catholic faith. "

Health (NIMH)»-estimates that 25
percent of the afflicted suffer
silently, unaware that their depres-
sion is biologically linked to a chem-
ical or hormonal imbalance and can
be treated successfully. Significant
progress has been made recently in
understanding and treating this
enigmatic disease. Much of this pro-
gress is due to the work of institu-
tions such as the University of
Pittsburgh Depression Clinic at the
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic. Researchers rank its pro-
gram for the treatment and research
of depressive disorders among the
three best in the country.

The clinics program .has a dual
purpose. It treats patients suffering

from major depression and is a_

research center in the study of
depression and its causes, which are
not fully understood. Researchers

The National Institute of Mental _are trying to ascertain if it is the

chemical imbalance that causes
depression or depressed thoughts
that trigger the imbalance. What is
understood is that the two go hand-
in-hand, and due to this discovery,
depression can be successfully
treated through a combination of
antidepressant drugs and psycho-
therapy. Fifty percent of depressed
persons will get better with
treatment.

It is important to differentiate
between a clinical depression and
the occasional blues. Sadness and
grief are normal emotions that eve-
ryone experiences at one time or
‘another in response to some form of
stress. In a matter of time, the mood

  enya trip ends
in death for six  

Three American couples from the
greater Pittsburgh area and two
Kenyans were killed early yesterday
morning when a minibus, carrying a
group of tourists, crashed with two
trucks 30 miles south of Machakos.

The tourists were among a group
of 30 who arrived in Kenya Nov. 26

to begin a two-week photogra'ph'yt_-

expedition sponsored by Pitt’s
Informal Program. The group had
been traveling in a caravan of ﬁve
minibuses, when the lead bus disap-
peared over a ridge. The accident
took place shortly after 8:30 a.m.
Dr. James McGruer, a physics
professor at the University of Pitts-
burgh, and his wife Charlotte were
among the dead. Also killed in the
accident were: Frederick and Naomi
Daggett Sr. of Johnstown and Gis-

ela and Burton Rapport of Church-
ill. Daggett was the retired division
manager of the Bar, Rod and Wire
Division of Bethlehem Steel Corpo-
ration. Rapport was a manufactur-
er’s representative selling hardware
and building supplies.

Five of the tourists were killed
instantly in the crash. The sixth died
en route to the hospital.

A U.S. Embassy spokesman said
the bodies have been taken to a Nai-
robi mortuary. They will be ﬂown

back to Pennsylvania in the next few’

days.

Betty Goodwin, study trip coordi-
nator for Pitt's Informal Program
will be flying to Brussels today to
meet others from the group and
escort them home. They are sche-
duled to arrive here on Thursday.

Talk   awcases

Nicaragua trips

By Mike Nicol
The Pitt News

In an Arms Race Study Group
lecture yesterday in the Student
Union, Robert Norman, associate
professor in GSPIA, and Mike
Snyder, Ph.D. candidate in English,
gave a first-hand report on the activ-
ities in Nicaragua 4 after having
recently returned from a two-month
stay in the strife-torn country.

Norman stressed that much of the

unrest is caused by three conflicting
loyalties. The first is political loyalty
to a particular state or a certain flag.
The second isloyalty to a particular
ideology, such as Marxist-Leninist
philosophy or capitalism. The third
and perhaps most important,
according to Norman, is that of uni-
versal principles on religious beliefs
that relate to war.

Norman’s experience with this
third loyalty, he said, “was the ‘Wit-
ness for Peace,’ a non-violent group
of Americans in Nicaragua, sent
unarmed to the war zone, who
returned afterwards to the 50
states.” Having such a congregation
present, according to Norman,
deterred some of the violence. “Hav-
ing all those Americans around,
maybe, has inhibited it,” said Nor-
man. “lt’s not as easy to blow up
bridges and kidnap people secretly
with them around.”

Also concerning the U.S. presence
in Nicaragua, Norman conjectured
that a revolt by Christians or Judeo-
Christians in the country would
cause the U.S. to “have a very hard
time dealing with it."

Snyder added, however, that he’

thinks “the Sandinista government

has been treating Christians fairly, .

for the most part, and has done
nothing to thwart them."

Norman then questioned whether
the government could evolve on its
own without “becoming a carbon
copy of Cuba.”

One of the listeners stressed this
exact point when commenting that
“every emerging government of a
smaller country is always,manipu-
lated by the superpowers, and you
have to question and wonder how

they would develop without con-‘

stant interference.”

Snyder, who actually lived with a
farming family in Nicaragua, gave a
better glimpse ofthe way the govern-
ment operates. “The only countries
in which I was searched heavily were
the ones that are American allies,
and also in Mexico, ofall places,”he
said. “I had a preconceived sym-
pathy for the revolution, I disagreed
with our policies there, and still do,
but with a much broader perspective
now.” A

In closing, the speakers said the
recent election results were not the
overwhelming victory that it might

Many students are not aware that
a large number of internships are
available with news and publication
organizations all over the city. Most
do not consider that an internship
can provide them with skills and
knowledge that may not have been
given in their classes. An internship
can provide valuable contacts and
skills that they will need in the job
market — before they graduate.

“You make a decision that your
internship is as, if not more, impor-
tant than your classes," said Todd
Erkel, a senior doing an internship
with The Pittsburgh Press. “If you
really want to know about writing
you have to be in a professional set-
ting. As soon as you get there you’re
thrown into the fire and expected to
produce as a working reporter.”

Erkel is doing his internship

_ through the guidance of the Writing

Internship Office, which runs a bit
differently from the internship office
for non-writing majors. While most
internships through the university
do not provide faculty guidance, the
Writing Internship Office is in con-
stant communication'with the stu-
dents and their sponsors. The
program also requires that the stu-
dents register for one of two classes:
News Internship or Public
Relations.

The news class, taught by Jim
Ross, meets every three weeks.
Every week the students hand in
clippings of their work and a report
about what they are doing. “I serve
as an independentjudge,” said Ross.
“An editor, for example, may think
an article is horrible while I may
think it is good, and vice versa. We
keep in constant communication
with the sponsors to see that the stu-
dent’s work in good quality and to
make sure that the sponsor is treat-
ing the students fairly."

“The experience gained from an
internship is essential for getting a

job,” said Lee Gutkind, director of
the program which began to provide
faculty guidance about two years
ago. “Many students do an intern-
ship in their senior year. This is the
best time, because if a job opens up,
the student already has over three
months experience. If you’re gradu-
ating, you can take the job,” said
Gutkind.

Although the Writing Internship
Office is primarily set up for writing
majors, anyone can apply. Ellen
Darion coordinates the program
from her office —-— next to a bulletin
board listing the internships pres-
ently available. “The writing intern-
ship isn’t for everyone,” said Darion.
“It is open to anyone that would
benefit from the experience of a
writing position. Grades and Q.P.A.
are considered during the screening
process, but the quality of writing
samples provided by the student is
the most important factor; -so if
you've been slacking off in your
grades but have good examples of
your work, you can still get an
internship.” Darion cited some of
the internships available, which
include work with the Civil Liberties
Union, Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce, Gulf Science and Tech-
nology, KDKA, The Pittsburgh
Press, and ‘Pittsburgh Magazine.
“The better the internship, the more
competition there is for it," said
Darion, “but the most glamorous
ones are not always the best." Often
if an organization is large and well
known, the interns may be asking to
run errands or other tasks that so
not help teach them the skills of the
job. .

Matt Goga, a senior doing an
internship with the campus radio
station WPTS, said, “It's great
because the staff is extremely profes-
sional. There’s no mention of the
internship. We are treated as staff.“
Goga is a newscaster for the “Pitts-
burgh Almanac Show” which airs

Internships with media offer
students valuable experience

4-4:45 p.m. every day. His work off
the air includes rewriting the UPI
wire for broadcast, and occasionally
going out and covering a story as a
reporter would. “It's excellent on-
the-job training,” said Goga. He
mentioned a visit from Channel 4’s
news director, when the director told

A the students that anyone doing an

internship with WPTS was prepar.
ing well for their careers.

Most of the internships are with-
out pay, but sometimes a student
may find a summerjob that fills the
requirements for an internship.
Also, a student may be paid if he
returns to a sponsor forta second
internship. For example,‘ Erkel is
salaried. This is his third internship,
and he is at The Pittsburgh.Press for
the second time. The internships
provide three credits for the students
and are designed to requireabout 12
hours per week. However, most stu-

dents find they spend up to 20 hours .

per week at their jobs, which is one
reason the internships are not sug-
gested for freshmen and sopho-
mores. Gabrielle Pease, who is doing
an internship with Pittsburgh Maga-
zine said, “I spend about five hours a
week at the internship, but on my
own I spend about eight to ten
hours, which includes the-time I
spend in the library reading." She
works on the editorial staff at the
magazine along with three other
interns. “They ‘listen to me and con-
sider my ideas," she said.

The most important aspect of
doing an internship is the help it
gives when the student is looking for
a job after graduation. These stu-
dents have on-the-job training
which many employers consider
more important than a degree.
Furthermore, if a student has had a
few basic writing courses such as
Intro, Magazine, News I and II, and
has samples of his work from those
classes, it is probable that the Writ-
ing Internship Office can find him an
internship. “We have an internship
for about every student that wants

one," said Gutkind.

He's been chased, thrown through a window. and orrested.

The fall term is finally coming to
an end and so are all the classes that
students have either conquered or
suffered through — or are they? lt’s
teacher evaluation time again, and
the forms being distributed give the
student body golden opportunity to
try to improve the quality and the
nature of teaching here at Pitt.

Overseeing the teacher evalua-
tions is the Office of Evaluation of
Teaching. On the forms, the stu-
dents are asked numerous questions
concerning their instr1ictor’s teach-
ing habits and performance. All the
respondants remain anonymous,
according to the chairman of the
English department, Mary Briscoe.
“The instructor is never present
while he is being evaluated, and the
forms aren’t returned to him until
about two weeks after the term ends,
usually, and until the grades are in,”
Briscoe said. A

Although the students’ evalua-
tions are a major factor in the overall
evaluation, other methods are also
used. Brisco said, “We also use peer
review, in which other faculty
members sit in on the teacher’s
classes, and we also solicit certain
letters, especially from graduate
students.”

Robert Whitman, a professor at
Pitt, said that there are other consid-
erations in these evaluations. “When
a faculty member is coming up for

promotion, _they [the OET] also con-
sider any publication contributions
and the amount ofdepartmental ser-

_ vice that has been given."

Not all~teachers are required to
participate in the student section of
their evaluations; it depends some-
what on their rank. According to
Briscoe, “When people are in the
tenure stream but are not yet
tenured, they are required to con-
duct two OET evaluations per year,
although they may choose whether
to have one class evaluated or all."

_The instructor may also be asked of

his course material for review.
Since student responses to thes_e
evaluations are so important,
responsible replies are needed.
According to Whitman, “You

L always get a few smart alecks who

say things that are intended to
annoy, but overall, I've had very few
of those." Whitman takes some of
the remarks to heart, however.
“They often make you recognize
that you should do something a little
bit differently. It gives a glimpse of
howyour approach appears to other
people.”

Students feel that they are very
responsible in writing their evalua-
tions. One student said that “this is
the only way I can truthfully tell my
professor that I hate-his teaching
style and back it up responsibly
without a confrontation.”

Another student thinks that the
process “helps me to make sure that
a good teacher has a chance to stay
where he is.” ‘

“The minority now is the middle

force, nonetheless." He added that

other one that tries to remove a bru-
tal regime is “not complete till the
regime is totally supressed,"

ll We also question the meaning behind the statement that the plan-
ning report is a "window in time”and does not “account for underly-

,ing trends." By itself that statement may be a relatively innocuous,

throw-away sentence. Coupled with the statement that “we must also
appreciate that our horizons extend beyond the scope  of our
physical and institutional boundaries," however, such sentiments
strike an ominous chord. Does the university intend to respond to
whatever the market will bear, no matter what that may be? If so, we
might prepare ourselves for needless tuition increases simply because
there are people who are willing to abide by them. We might also
prepare ourselves for the elimination of the English and Fine Arts
departments or the metamorphasis of the University of Pittsburgh
into the Greater Pitt Vocational Technical Institute.

This brings us to a third point: Posvar states that an impending
information science revolution “may not alter that much the way we

iseem to or actually teach and learn. What effects the supercomputers

iz_i:t_t_d,’these new myriad fiber. optic lines running under our feet will
bring we cannot say, but in our ‘Campus of the Future‘ it is our intent
to be prepared for what comes." That statement alone taints the entire
document which follows because it says that-no one has any idea
whether the multimillion dollar project is worth as much as the
already four-month-late staff / faculty directory. Yet we will still
spend, spend, spend, while cutting departments whose enrollments
fall beneath an arbitrarily established quota.

Finally, we wish to express our displeasure toward the last sentence
in Posvar’s message. He states that he is certain that the plans revealed
in the report, if carried out, will be a “forward step in our development
as a stellar center of learning and discovery." The choice of the term
“stellar" is not without implication. lt refers to stars in the heavens, far
removed from tangible and practical matters.

women, especially married women
will cry rape on a whim; that they use
rape as some sort of “H1 get him
now" ploy. Not only is this stereo-
type completely unfounded
(research has indicated that

“Women are quite reluctant to label .

sexual experiences in marriage as
rape and only do so for serious rea-
sons.” (Frieze, 1984)), but it is dan-
gerous. Rape is a humiliating,
degrading act —— to even suggest that
any form of rape be taken lightly
may well encourage victims to keep
silent aboutthe crime. Further, such
an attitude highlights your own low
regard for women. To suggest that
marriage is an allowable arena for
rape to occur is outrageous.

Rape is rape —— regardless of the
circumstance, being forced to per-
form a sexual act (whether that force
"is in the form of physical violence or
verbal threat) is rape. Married 1
women are not their husband's
property. They are individuals with
the right to the protection of law.
There are no exceptions to the rule.

It’s Cool? to be Conservative

Lately there‘s been a lot of talk on
the pages of this newspaper about
the changing political values of the
American people. People on the
right argue that conservatism is the

new awakening, and that the Grand _

Old Party is going to make this
country great again. People on the
left argue that Reagan has painted a
false picture of the current socio-
economic situation, and they
wonder what has happened to lib-
eral sensitivity. A few have even
gone so far as to mourn what is start-
ing to look like the death of their
party. They think the fact that every-
body and their lawyer is voting GOP

these days means that nobody cares ‘

for their fellow steelworker any-
more. Well, I’m here to tell you that
notion is just nottrue. I say, let's
consider this issue on terms we can
all understand. Sure, more people
are votingffor the GOP nowadays.
But why "is that so? Well,’let’s face it.
These days, it's just cooler to be a
Republican.

Wait a second. Did I hear you
right?

Yes, that’s what I said.

Think about it. First of all,
Republicans make more money. In
the past, that wasn’t as important
(after all, who cared about the inter-

est rate under Kennedy?_), but these 7

days, making more money'is.in. Ev-

erybody wants to do it, especially

those pre-professional majors down
at the University of Texas. Vote for
Reagan-Bush. Rah, rah.

Why else is it cooler to be a
Republican these days? Well, for
another thing, Republicans are

tough. If you’re a Republican,

nobody messes with you. Would the
Republicans have let the American

hostages stay imprisoned in Iran for '

as long as they were? Heck, no. And

. who rescued those oppressed medi-

cal students in Grenada? Yep, it was
the Republicans. Gung-ho, gung-
ho. Go get ‘em, Haig. Oops, I mean
Shultz. '

Another reason it’s cool to be a
Republican is that all Republicans
have jobs. And not only that, they
have nicejobs, notjobs like working
in a mill or driving a truck. Face it,
people who belong to the GOP
know what a good career is.

What else makes it cooler to be .a
Republican? If you’re a Republican,
you live in a nice house, and every-
body wants to live in ajnice house.
Not like the houses of non-
Republicans, which are often found
in ghettos and blue-collar towns.

‘But no matter. No need to think

about that when you’re at the club.
Golf, anyone? Geez, who wouldn't
want to be a Republican?

to blame.” Remember back in the
‘70s it was cooler to be a Democrat,
expecially a liberal Democrat. Why?
Because back then, the Republicans
were “the ones to blame."_At that
time, if you had any woes, you
blamed the policies of the GOP.
Down with Vietnam. Down with the
oppressive establishment. Vote for
McGovern-Shriver. Rah, rah.
Then, a funny thing happened.
Nixon resigned, and the Democrats
elected the peanut farmer. Now,
with the Democrats inpower, they
became “the ones to blame.” If you
had any woes, you blamed the poli-
cies of the left. Down with inﬂation.
Down with passivism. Vote for the
Great Communicator. Rah, rah.
Why is it that more people are

. voting for the right nowadays?

Face it, these days it’s just cooler
to be a Republican.

 

Adam Eisenstat

The collective “ughs" and “ohhs"
spewed by girls —~ er, women -— in a
class when they sense a sexist remark
is grating but nice. More noise.
More rage. More non sequiturs.
School needs this. Life needs this.

The blase concrete decor of
Forbes Quad aptly punctuates the
three- or four-year passive class-
room exercise we call Pitt. The only
community one can discern here is

the community of restless transience -

-— so many people holding their
breath to getout as their minds turn
blue. Heh, heh. Perhaps this. just
isn‘t the place for soul.

CMU, whose generally vapid
and/ or uninteresting students are a
living testament to the flagrant myth
of the overpriced, exclusive school,
does seem to have a little more char-
acter than Pitt. Even though it is a
militarylindustry farm club, CMU
has a sense of community — what-

ever that means. This may be attrib- ‘

uted to its small, intimate campus
and lack of a real football team to
drain and smother aimless student
passion. CMU reeks of the boho
stink of the arts. The girls are pack-
aged with all the latest new wave
bobs. And its radio station isn’t wor-
ried about professionalism (other-
wise known as the tame-lame
syndrome). A .

A Ahh, but then,l can always buy
two or three 40-ounce, Mickeys and

head down to Panther Hollow and
enmesh myself in bleak industrial
memories of bleak industrial times
past. But wait! No. This burgh is too
much the corporate shell, torturing
itself and its few undeluded denizens
with ghastly pretensions. A native,
homestretch student like myself feels
a mite caged. I seek no solace in
drink, anyhow.

A university’s character can be in

judged by its bars. Pitt, of course,

ranks a zilch here. With the devasta- .
tion of Danny's, a once homey‘
quasi-dive, the Forbes-Fifth. axis,

save maybe for Pitt Tavern, is now a
purely jock-meatmarket wasteland.
ls t-he super-tawdry setup at the
Upstage Lounge a parody or what?
Bars are important places. Many
crucial things are discussed over
suds-on-formica in dusky corner
booths. This scenario, however,
does not exist in Oakland's main
drag. Of course, it all reflects the
students, who by virtue of the

. junkfood-video-donut brand of cap-

italism, are given what they want. I'd
like to think it was all a conspiracy
by the AMA (carcinogens every-
where y’know) or someone, but it’s
just plodding sterility, towering over
the phallus of learning like a great
Spiny Norman.

I would go on, but the Top 40 of
WPTS beckons. I must feed my
school spirit. A ’

A passerby stops to look at the unique merchandise of'Drawer’s.

specialty

By Donald Porter
The Pitt News

For many years, women have had
the fortune to be able to buy fine
undergarments such as teddies, cam-
isoles and tap pants to name a few.
But for men, the selection has been
limited tothe basic boxer shorts and
white or colored underwear.

Today, men can choose from an
array of styles in briefs, and one
store that specializes in men’s under-
wear is Drawers. “Drawers is the
only men’s underwear shop in the
county,” said its owner, Olivia

.Zitelli. It’s located in the heart of
Oakland on Meyran Avenue.

People stop and smile when they
see the bright red, black, blue, yel-
low and white briefs displayed in

straw baskets arranged in the center ’

of the store’s floor. Underwear is dis-
played on antinue furniture which
gives the store a classy look. “We
want the store to be comfortable.
That’s why we put antiques in here,"
said Zitelli.

Black see-through bikinis are dis-

played along with mesh and lace and «

animal prints and G—strings. The
store also sells underwear into which
two people may fit. And,» for those
who really want to serveitheir coun-
try, ‘there are Marine camouﬂage

Undergarments  

briefs.

Drawers manager, Dan Stewart,
said that 50 percent of their custom-
ers are men and the other 50 percent
are women. “Sometimes women
come in and buy underwear for their
boyfriends or husbands,” said
Stewart.

Zitelli said her customers come
from all backgrounds. She went on
to say that students, doctors and
administrators shop there. “People
also come and relax or have fun and
look around," said Zitelli.

Dave Zulice, a Pitt student who
was shopping with his sister Kath-
leen, said the different colored
underwear on the display model in
the window caught his eye.

“It’s fun in here and I would come
back,” said Kathleen Zulice, who
was buying a gift for her boyfriend.
Ellen Amirato, a customer, said that
more stores like this are needed.
“Men need to be liberated. They are
special too,” she said. ~. . ” .

Zitelli got the idea for Drawers
from trying to buy novelty under-
wear for her boyfriend. She.couldn’t
find the style she wanted and had to

order it from the manufacturer in
New York. “There is always some-
one saying to me that it's about time
somebody started up a store like
this," she_ said.

Drawers has its own designer,
Gary Bower ‘of Pittsburgh. He has
been inthe business for 17 years, and
designs the shirts displayed at
Drawers...   e _.

This ;Christmas, Drawers will be
selling Maribou Santa G-strings,
Funta Wear Christmas Underwear,
jingle bell G—string, and underwear
that will say “Kiss me under the
mistletoe" and lots more.

(UPI) — Iranian authorities
said one person died in a fight
yesterday on a hijacked Kuwaiti
Airways plane. Another was
injured. It is not known if the
fight took place before or after
the hijacked plane landed in Teh-
ran. More than l60 people were
on thejet, bound from Kuwait to
Pakistan. Iran's official news
agency said ﬁve Arabic-speaking
people hijacked the plane.

The Iranians said they sent up
an air force plane to intercept the
airliner in Iranian air space. Iran
said it let the jet land because it
was running out of fuel and
because the hijacker threatened
to blow it up in flight.

(UPI) — Authorities in Port
Richey, Florida, have charged
two children with extorting
money from a schoolmate by
threatening to beat him up.

They say a 12-year-old girl and
an ll-year-old boy were paid
$7.25 a week by the nine-year-old
boy. The victim handed over $5
every Monday and his daily
snack allowance of 45 cents
because he was afraid of the
other kids. ‘

Officials also said the boy had
to leave the back door of his
house unlocked when nobody
was homeso the older children
could steal things. The boy’s
mother said cash, jewelry and
other items worth 8750 were

taken. The mother said she
found out about the extortion
when she saw her son give the girl
money and askedhim about it.

   

(UPI) — A newly released
government document reveals
that the Army used passengers at
Washington’s National Airport

 and at a.bU$. terminal in the capi-
‘ tal in tests related to biological
warfare. They were secretly
sprayed in 1964 and 1965 with
bacteria to see how enemy forces
might start a smallpox epidemic.
The bacteria was bacillus subti-
lis, which the document said was
harmless. A medical dictionary
says it can infect humans only
rarely.

The tests also may have
included bus terminals in Chi-
cago and San Francisco, but the
heavily censored document does
not make it clear.

The document is labeled “Mis-
cellaneous Publication 7" and
stamped “Secret.” It was
obtained through the Freedom
of Information Act by the
Church of Scientology, which
has exposed previous Army and
CIA drug experiments. g

The United States is still
researching. biological weapons,
but Defense Secretary Wien-
berger said it is not involved in
developing them.

India, are visions of fact that
rival fiction. It has been one day
since a valve on an underground
tank at a pesticide factory rup-
tured, releasing a poison gas that
ﬂoated over the central Indian
city of 800,000. At least 500 peo-
ple are dead, with the number
expected to rise. Officials said
most of the dead are children and
old men.
Victims

were still being

,brought yesterday morning to -

hospitals where 2,000 already
were admitted. Some l8,000
other people were being treated
in makeshift facilities. Many of
the victims arrived frothing at
the mouth, vomiting, their eyes
inﬂamed or blind. A hospital
spokesman said many were
drowning in their own blood,
which was flowing into their
damaged lungs. Others wan-
dered the streets to die.

Police posted at the gates of
one hospital brandished long
bamboo sticks to keep emotional
crowds ‘outside from blocking
the entrance. So many bodies
flowed into the city morgue that
it ran out of fuel to cremate them.

The factory is owned by Union
Carbide, headquartered in Con-
necticut. According to the com-
pany, a vent scrubber on the tank
should have neutralized the gas
— methyl isocyanate —— before it
leaked into the air. '

Women  

(USPS) — With more than 44
million women in the work force,
women command a substantial
amount of financial , clout. But
although on the average they earn
and save more, many are still uncer-
tain about what to do with their sav-
ings, according to a recent survey.

Women save l 1.5 percent of their
pre-tax income on the average,
nearly triple the savings rate of the
nation as a whole. However, the sur-
vey of 901 Working Woman maga-
zine readers showed that many lack

the confidence and skills to make the
most ‘of their savings. Almost half
the women are confused about
financial options.

In addition to the 49 percent of
women unsure of what to do with
their money, 35 percent say they
want to invest in stocks but do not

 know which to buy; 35 percent are

afraid of losing more money than
they make on investments and 26

hesitant  invest

percent are not sure when to buy or

. sell investments. (The total is more
than I00 percent because respond- '

ents may have checked more than
one answer.) , ,

Savings accounts,‘ in spite of their
low yields, are used by 72 percent of
the ‘women. The survey ranked
approximately‘ one third_ of the
women as conservative investors,
near one half as moderate risk-
takers and almost 20 percent as
speculators.

Younger women do not feel as
comfortable with financial decisions
as women over age 50, the survey
showed. Marital status also affected
certainty. Only 42 percent of mar-
ried women said they feel uncertain
about their financial decisions, while
half of those separated, divorced or
widowed said they do. About 55 per-
cent of women either single or living
with another felt unsure.

In spite of their insecurity, 75 per-
cent of the single women hold their
own national credit card, compared
to half of the married women sur-
veyed. “Undoubtedly, the unmar-
ried women have no choice but to
act on their own.’ Yet the survey sug-
gests a disturbing tendency on the
part of married women to see their
financial roles as extensions of their
husbands‘,” Bonnie Siverd, a per-

, sonal ﬁnance specialist and author

of the article, said.

Single women also were twice as
likely as married women to take out
a loan or put money in a money
market or mutual fund under their
own name, the survey showed. Also,
women under age 25 were found
twice as likely to have obtained an
auto loan in-the past three years as
women over 50 and were three times
as likely to have purchased addi-
tional life insurance.

Competition for jobs
to get much worse

(USPS) —— A glut of people enter-
ing the work force in the next 10
years may cause stiff competition for
job hunters in spite of the expected
increase in the number ofjobs.

By 1990, the number of jobs is.
expected to incpease by 25.2 million.
But the increase in the number of
people wishing to enter the work
force will be greater, resulting in 3.8
million more people than jobs.

Experts have said college gradu-

ates still have a better chance of get-
ting those jobs. In fact, a recent
survey of employers by the College
Placement Council, Inc., showed
that participating employers antici-
pate hiring 8 percent more college
graduates in 1985 than in 1984.

However, only 25 percent of the
40 fastest-growing occupations
require a college degree.

The 40 occupations with the larg-
est expected job growth were chosen

A from 1,700 listed by the U.S. Bureau

of Labor Statistics. Over the next
decade-and-a-half, much of the job

growth will take place in service ‘

industries, where 74.1 percent (18.7
million) new jobs will be created in
areas such as transportation and
public utilities, ﬁnance insurance,
real estate and government.
Another 26 percent (6.5 million)
new ' jobs will be in the goods-

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

 

producing industries. Those include
farming, mining, construction and
manufacturing.

The seven occupations with the
largest job growth include custodi-
ans, cashiers, secretaries,‘ general
clerks, salesclerks and waiters and
waitresses, bureau data showed.

Quickly-expanding occupations
requiring college degrees include
registered nurses, kindergarten and
elementary teachers, electrical engi-
neers, physicians and lawyers.

Although the majority of the
fastest-growing occupations do not
require a college education, many do
require some type of post-secondary
school training. Occupations requir-
ing such post-secondary education
include automotive mechanics and
electricians. Jobs not requiring
advanced education are also pro-
jected to expand.

More than half of the high-growth
occupations are in the computer or
other technical or health ﬁelds.
Computer-related occupations
expecting the largest growth are
computer service technicians, com-
puter systems analysts, computer
programmers and computer
operators.

Stress topic of discussion

By Ingrid Smith
The Pitt News

There you are, you know that you
have a physics exam in two days.
You know that you really should
study, but instead you decide to pick
up a magazine and look through it.
You ﬁnished the magazine. You
stare at the phone. The next thing
you know, you ‘re calling your home-
town friend. You spend two hours
on the phone. By now, it ‘s too late to
pick up that Physics book, so you
climb into bed and tell yourself
you ‘ll do; it tomorrow.

If this sounds familiar to you,
according to John Morris of Pitt’s
Learning Skills Center, you are a
procrastinator and a prime candi-
date for stress.

Morris presented several points.
on how students can make studying
work for them. First he stressed that
the student must say to himself, “I
will remember and I want to study."
Next, and equally important, is his
prior knowledge about the class.
According to the center, chances are

that a student who walks into a
classroom having no background on
what the course is like will have a
tough time.

Morris recommended that an
individual only study for 45 minutes
to an hour and then take a 10- to
IS-minute break. He also said that
reviewing periodically helps a stu-
dent remember more than just sit-
ting down and trying to relearn
everything for a final. “You're not
going to remember 100 percent; tests
show that the human mind only can
recall 75 to 80 percentof memory,”
said Morris.

Morris presented some common
attitudes that students have that lead
to procrastination. “We all avoid

unpleasant tasks; either we find it

difficult or boring. The only solution
we have is to control procrastination
and not let it control us." He believes
that students devise their own tech-
niques, such as unstructured time,
that help them say yes to procrasti-
nation.

“A student can have two hours
between classes, and instead of uti-
lizing this time, he waits for what he
thinks would be a better time,” said

Morris. “Then, when the student
realizes he's wasted too much time,
the worry and guilt set in. You look
at your tuition bill and think about
how much money you’ve wasted —
but the real problem is that more
people spend time worrying than
trying to get anything accomp-
lished."

“The best way to get yourself out
of this position is to sit down and
schedule your time according to
what you have to do. But remember

to be realistic; set realistic goals for

yourself. In other words, don’t think
you can read four chapters from one
of your books in an hour."

Finally, Morris and the Learning
Skills Center recommend that when
you sit down to study you have all
the necessary tools with you (pencil,
pen and highlighter). Then, choose
an environment that is relatively free
from distraction. Finally, try to stick
to some type of study schedule.

The Learning Skills Center will be
offering a ﬁnals workshop to anyone
experiencing any type of study prob-
lems during the finals period. The
center is located on the third floor of
the William Pitt Union.

Upbeat’ documentary portrays
women working in the mills

By Jill Colamarino
The Pitt News

“Women of Steel,” a 1984 video
documentary about the experiences
of three local women in the Monon-
gahela Valley steel mills, received a
standing ovation Monday evening
at Carlow College.

The 30-minute video, presented
by Mon Valley Media, shows the
work and home experiences of Sher-
rie, -Patty and Sheryl as representa-
tive of many women in “recent
American heavy industry.”

“Women of Steel” begins with the
legislation of the 1960s that “opened
the door to traditionally malejobs"
for women and some problems they
faced in being accepted by their male
co-workers.

“There is the misconception that
women steelworkers are big, tough

Memorial
service
to be

broads," said one petite woman in
the video. “It's not true. It’s just not
true.” The video stressed the issue
that, for most women in heavy
industry, the skills they learned were
a means of “survival from low-
paying, traditional women’s jobs”
such as social service occupations.

The video places the most empha-
sis on the effects of the loss ofindus-
trial jobs for women and the wearing
away of affirmative action
programs.

Although the subject matter is
serious, the video is upbeat, even
humorous at times, and is
interspersed with songs by Donna
Summer and Holly Near as well as
local television news clips.

Mon Valley Media, a four-
woman research organization which
records and documents the contem-
porary history of the Monongahela
Valley, hopes to get its video aired
on television in the near future. The
video is also available for rentals.

A panel discussion on organizing
women with Elaine Stiff, organizer
for a service employees’ union and
Elaine Rapping, associate professor
at Robert Morris College, followed
the video. I

Stiff said she saw the theme of
“Women of Steel” as one of “self-
image” for women steelworkers.
They find “pride and challenge” in
acquiring those skills only recently
opened to them.

Rapping discussed the relation-
ship between art and politics, saying
the notions such as “art and politics
are separate” and “propaganda isn't
‘real’ art” are “myths,” “Artists per-
suade, this video persuades,” she
said. _

She also discussed the media and
its socialization process. “The media

_ is where women first learn that they

can’t do something,” she said. “This
video shows people who didn't think
they could do something important,
that they can.”

unable to sleep or sleeps too much
and consequently is either agitated

‘or lethargic. A depressed person will

lose interest in sex, eating and other
pleasurable activities. Someone
once active will become unable. to
get out of bed in the morning. What
is more, the mood persists for weeks
or months — even years.

“It’s almost like becoming a non-
person,” explained a patient in the
program at the clinic. “You exist,
you don't live."

“Depression is a group of dis-
eases," said Paul Pilkonis, a
researcher at the clinic. At a basic
level the disease can be broken in
two types, unipolar and bipolar,
with many variances within each.

“Depression presents itself in dif-
ferent ways in different people," said
Miriam Jacob, the program coordi-
nator for the University of Pitts-
burgh Depression Prevention
Program. The symptoms manifest
themselves in opposite ways. The
agitated depressive will be jumpy,
nervous and unable to sleep and eat.
The anergic depressive will be
slowed’down and lethargic (psy-
chomotor retardation). The patient,
even after sleeping 10 to 12 hours
will still have a need for naps. Rather
than undereating, the anergic
depressive will overeat and gain
weight. A major recurrent unipolar
depressive will suffer from intermit-
tent periods of intense sadness,
hopelessness and lack of self-esteem
and think of suicide. These black
moods may give way to a more nor-
mal mood, but the depression usu-
ally returns.

Sometimes the depression is pres-
ent all the time. A bipolar depres-
sion, more commonly known as
manic depression, will consist of
alternating cycles of highs and lows.
During the high or manic phase, bi-
polar depressives may possess seem-

ingly boundless energy and feel
capable of any undertaking. They
tend not to think of themselves as
depressed.

“A bipolar depressive won’t say
‘I’m depressed,’ [during the low
cycle]," according to Jonathan Him-
melhoch, M.D. “He'll say, ‘I don’t
know what’s wrong with me today, I
can't seem to get started.’ ” Himmel-
hoch is a researcher at the institution
and an expert on depression.

Some types of depression are not
commonly thought of as such. A
hypomanic will be in a high cycle all
the time and consequently will be
extremely productive and successful‘
— a lover of risks. According to
Ronald Fieve, M.D., a pioneer in
the use ofthe drug lithium carbonate
in the treatment of manic depres-
sion, hypomanics tend to be highly
competent and aggressive. They love
to gamble and tend to be successful
businessmen.

Depression is widespread to such
an extent that it has come to be
known as “the common cold of men-
tal illness." Although the vast major-
ity of patients are treated on an
outpatient basis, depression can
manifest itself so profoundly that
the victim needs to be hospitalized.
It may even be fatal — I5 percent of
depressed persons eventually com-
mit suicide according to NIMH
statistics.

“Sometimes the depression is so
severe as to make it impossible to
function outside the hospital," said
Dr. Suzanne Griffin, a physician at
the 26-bed inpatient clinic at WPIC.
“The reason may be suicidal idea-
tion, or they may not eat enough to
sustain life," said Griffin, “or a
mania so profound that they’re dan-
gerous to themselves." Once hospi-
talized, the patient’s depression is
battled with a whole arsenal oftreat-
ments, according to Griffin, includ-
ing antidepressant drugs,
psychotherapy and electro-

convulsive (electro-shock) therapy.
But despite its serious nature,
depression is widely misunderstood
in that it is associated with a lackof
character and considered a weak-
ness. “It should be looked upon as
other diseases such as diabetes and
hypertension,” said David J.
Kupfer, M.D., professor and chair-
man of the Department of Psychia-
try at the University of Pittsburgh..
There is increasing evidence that
depression is genetically linked, said
Kupfer, and researchers have
proven that it is a biological and
physiological disease, correctable
the majority of the time by the vast
array of antidepressant drugs avail-
able. “The happiest time of my life
was my evaluation at WPIC,” said a
patient. “It was such a relief to find
out I wasn’t responsible for my
depression. It lifted the world off my
shoulders." '

For many, depression is only
occasional, but for just as many it
becomes a chronic illness.

Mary Randall (not her real name)
is 48, married and works as a secre-
tary. She has three children and is a
grandmother. For the last 27 years
she has suffered from major recur-
rent unipolar depression for six
months out of the year.

“Every October I begin to feel sad
and withdraw,” said» Randall. “l
‘ don’t sleep well, only for an hour or
so, and I don’t eat well. I lose lots of
weight.” ‘

Last January, Randall entered the
University of Pittsburgh Depression
‘Prevention Program. After the
initial evaluation and four nights of
sleep study, her depression was diag-
nosed and she started a program
involving the drug Imipramine com-
bined with psychotherapy. For the
first three months, she saw a thera-
pist weekly. As the Imipramine took
effect, her sessions were reduced to
every other week. Gradually, her
symptoms subsided and she felt
much better. Her sessions were
further cut back to once a month,
and then in August she was admitted
to what is called the maintenance
phase of the treatment. This is where
the prevention of depression begins.
Now she is randomly assigned to one
of five treatment groups. As she con-
tinues her monthly therapy session,
her Imipramine is alternated with a
placebo, a method used for under-
standing and preventing this disease.
“We won't take a patient until at
least the third episode of _depres-
sion,” said Miriam Jacob, the pro-_

A parable to

gram coordinator ofthe Depression
Prevention Program. “In the people
we treat, the depression averages six
months of day-in and day—out low
mood resulting in impaired
performance.”

Jacob quoted a patient as saying,
“Just filling the sugar bowl is com-
climbing Mount
Everest.”

“You have to feel this way to be
depressed,” said Jacob. Of all the
people who suffer a first episode of
clinical depression, she said, 50 per-
cent will go on to have another epi-
sode. Of those who experience two
clinical depressions, there is an 80
percent likelihood ofa third. And of
those who have suffered three or
more episodes, there is a 95 percent
chance of a subsequent onset of
depression.

“The people we treat are almost
certain to have another episode,”
said Jacob. “The more episodes a
person has, the length of time at
which they feel normal gets shorter
and shorter.”

The program is designed not only
to treat the depressed person but
also to study this disease, the aim
being to prevent the otherwise cer-
tain relapse. Much is still not
known. “We don’t know if medicine
alone will help the patient,” said
Jacob, “or whether they need drugs
and psychotherapy or just psycho-
therapy alone."

The five treatment programs are
designed to test the efficacy of those
three alternatives. For three years
patients are randomly assigned -
while continuing therapy — con-
tinue taking Imipramine or to take a
placebo. Or the patient may be
assigned to therapy alone. There are
two other phases, consisting of clinic
treatment with either Imipramine or
placebo.

“I believe that I’m on placebo,”
said Randall, “because the side
effects have gone away. The side
effects to antidepressant medication
can consist of dry mouth, nausea,
constipation or blurry vision. Some-
times these side effects can cause
physical problems.

“Even with the side effects, it's
well worth it,” Jim enthusiastically
exclaimed. He described his life
before treatment as “pure hell. Life
was rock bottom. Just getting up in
the morning was a real problem.
Now I feel great. I'm enjoying my
job and doing a lot of traveling. I'm
even taking pilot lessons."

Mary Randall isjust as enthusias-
tic about the change in her life. She
said of her 27 yearly bouts with
depression, “It's as though there's a
cloud over your head. The only emo-
tion I can recall is being sad and
unhappy all the time. Depression
pervaded, my entire life, even when I
was feeling well." All that is changed
now, she said. “My life improves
every day. I just had the best
Thanksgiving of my entire life.”

Jacob said that the patients are
“coddled” and are “treated with kid
gloves." While the drop out rate ofa
typical institution is 40 to 50 percent,
the Depression Prevention Program
boasts of a drop out rate of only IO
percent. '

‘Jacob also admitted there is much
to be learned. It is not known why
women outnumber men four to one
in the program or if depression
causes physical changes or the other
way around. It is known that depres-
sion is a response to stress. Jacobs
has noticed an increase in the
number of students seeking evalua-
tion during the time of final exams.
But it is not known why stress
triggers a depression and why in
some people the depression becomes
chronic. That is why the facility. is as
much devoted to research as to the
healing of patients.

“The clinical effect is clear,” said
Pilkonis. “People respond positively
to treatment. But the direct physio-
logical effect is not certain.” Pilkonis
heads the NIMH-funded research
study comparing the use of therapy
and drugs. His study, which is part
of a collaborative effort nationwide,
won't be concluded for two years.
For now, he said that any conclu-
sions researchers have are “all
hypothesis.” ‘

But an area in which much practi-
cal application has been found is in
the work done at the sleep research
facility at WPIC.

“The nighttime is a great time to
get a window into the brain,” said
Kupfer. The study of sleep patterns
is vital in diagnosing the depression.
Every patient in the program will
undergo four nights of sleep study
before being admitted. A depressed
person's rapid eye movement phase
of sleep (REM) will occur much ear-
lier in the night than normal and will
happen mostly in the first half of the
night. REM in a normal person
occurs mostly in the second half of
sleep. Also monitored are the chemi-
cal and hormonal changes asso-
ciated with depression.

Besides its diagnostic usefulness,
sleep research helps the scientists
determine the effectiveness of adrug
or therapy by -measuring what
happens to an individual’s sleep
patterns as he gets better. Kupfer
called .it a means of “probing the
biology.” Researchers hope to
improve diagnosis ofdepression and
discover how best to prevent future
episodes.

“Most of us believe that perhapsa
person is wired in such a way from
birth as to be predisposed to depres-
sion," said Kupfer. “It may he
genetic.”

Dr. Himmelhoch is developing a
wristband that monitors the activity
of the depressed patient. He says the
wristband will be able to measure
the patient‘s recovery by detecting a
subtle change in posture. He is also
trying to find the reason why one
powerful antidepressant causes
symptoms similar to narcolepsy and
is experimenting with the use of epi-
leptic drugs to treat depression. '

Whatever answers their research
may find, there is relief here and now
for the depressed person. Through-
out history depression has besieged
the likes of Winston Churchill,’
Abraham Lincoln and Alexander
the Great. Perhaps in the future
there will be an answer to this
disease. ‘

“We don’t know ifthe mind think-
ing depressed thoughts causes these
chemical changes or whether the
chemical imbalance in the brain is
what causes the depression," said
Dr. H. Keith Brodie, president of the

1 American Psychiatrist Association.

Basketball team to play

Mountaineers in W. Virginia

By Jim (lrban
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball team
heads south of the border tonight as
Coach Judy Saurer’s squad invades
Morgantown, W. Va. to challenge
the Lady Mountaineers of West Vir-
ginia University.

The Panthers will be looking for
the same success they enioyed last
year when they defeated West Vir-
ginia 77-61 at Fitzgerald Field
House. Saurer admitted that it may
not be as easy as it was last year. “We
have to be ready to play,” she said.
“They're going to be real tough to

. beat.” ‘

That is a voice of experience talk-
ing. The last time Saurer took a team
to the Colosseum in Morgantown,
some questionable officiating, com-
bined with a fired-up West Virginia
team, resulted in Pitt's only loss in

. history to West Virginia in women’s
basketball,_ an 84-66 loss during the
‘82-83 season. '

Co-coaches Kitty Blakemore and
Bill Fisk are confident that West
Virginia will be ready once again.

this weekend.

The 3,601 fans in the sparsely

populated Fitzgerald Field House

on Monday night watched the pre-
game intros of starting lineups,
ready to acknowledge, when cued,
the pathetic traits spread before
them.

Deception, they later learned, is a
one-way street.

Led by Mr. Unconventional,
Butch van Breda Kolff, Lafayette
paid the Panthers a visit. Many
thought Lafayette only had inten-

tions of trying to play a basketball.

game. After all, the Leopards only
had one man over 200 lbs. starting.
The others? Take your pick between
160 and 195.

Unknown to everyone but them-
selves, the Leopards did make a
game of it before succumbing to the
Panthers (2-1) 80-66. That was sur-
prise No. l of the evening. No. 2
came from two of the Panthers bet-
ter point producers, Charles Smith
and Chip ~ Watkins. Both were
limited to 14 points by, of all things,
a three—guard lineup.

“With that kind of offense, I fig-

ured in checking them,” Watkins
said after fouling out with 5:36 to go
and Pitt up by only six. “I tried to
overplay them and they went
around; They had that kind of
game.” And more_. The Panthers
built a 34-27 intermission advantage
into 10- and I2-point leads before
Lafayette whittled the spread down
to four with 4:51 left to play and
Smith still fresh off the bench
because of four earlier fouls.

Brushing off ll second-half turn- ‘
‘ overs, the Panthers capitalized on

Lafayette’s fatigue and pulled away
for good and handed the Leopards

their third loss against three wins.

“I think the biggest thing we hope
to do at this time of year is get to be
better each time,” Chipman said.
“But we keep making the same mis-
takes. If we make mistakes, as I said
to them, we have to make different
mistakes.”

A sudden resurgence by
Lafayette’s backcourt and Smith's
14-minute absence in the second
frame brought the Leopards back
into the game. “What the coach said
was I had to play more aggressive,"
Smith said. “I was throwing the
elbows around and I didn’t get
caught all the time. But on my fourth
foul, I didn’t even touch [forward
John Coalmon]. Ijumped but he
pulled around."

“A lot were foolish fouls," Chip-

Curtis Aiken once again scored in double digits
Monday night against Lafayette.

 

haz Palla/ The Pitt News

man said of Pitt’s I6. “We played
about all of the second half without
Chip or Charles. We can’t give Arm-
strong the kind of help he needs with
those two on the bench."

Smith and others watched Swiss-
vale guard Ron Reynolds get all of
his l5 points after the half, along
with Coalmon’s eight (10 overall).
Forward Gary Benne t helped him-
self to l6. The thr e never could
equal the shootingsof Keith Al" -
strong and Curtis Aiken. Each
scored 16 points as both continue to
dominate Pitt’s scoring charts.

It was Aiken, though, who
planted himself at the top of the key
in the second half and converted six
of seven from the field in Smith's
absence.

“This was similar to the last
game," Aiken said, “but in the last
one we questioned our shooting
coming into the second half. We

came in a little cold today, but we
were more confident.”

The 21 turnovers occupied Chip-
man’s thoughts, tempered some-
what by the Panthers’ improved 56.9
percent shooting. “We wanted
[Lafayette] to commit 20 turnovers
and we got that, we wanted to shoot
52 percent and we did. We wanted to
outrebound them, too [35-24]. But
we had 21 turnovers. We didn’t want
that and that's the most important
thing."

van Breda Kolff wasn't that dis-
pleased over his sixth game in I0
days — including a 46-point pasting
by St. John's last week. “I liked the
way we played tonight," the first-
year skipper said. “If we play like
that all year, we'll win some games.
We worked hard, played together.
I'm very pleased.”

“We went into the game with the

The Pitt men’s swim team tra-

freshmen. “Our whole team did
good,.” Lewis stated. “We had a
lot of freshmen come in and per-
form really well for us.”

Despite — or perhaps because
of -— the successful meet, Lewis
said that-the team will have to
work hard in preparation for the
Pitt Invitational, which will be
held Dec. 2 I-22. “We had a lot of

killer yardage coming up to get
ready for our next meet. We are
going to work hard."

The swim team has only three
remaining meets before the Big
East championships, which are
held at Pitt in late February and
early March. The Panthers’ next
home meet is Jan. 26 against .the
Mountaineersgof West Virginia.

Hockey man
appeals to
female fans

In keeping with the holiday
tradition, “Yes, Virginia, there is
a Pitt hockey team.”

Hopefully, this will put to rest
any doubts about its authentic-
ity. On any given Friday or Sat-
urday night, there are 22 guys out
at any one of Oakland’s luxuri-
ous night spots trying to con-
vince prospective, female “fans"
to come out and enjoy a game.
Most every well-conceived open-
ing line gets countered with, “I
didn’t know Pitt had a hockey
team!"

Well, ladies and gentlemen, it
is true. With a record of 6-1-1,
the team is off to a, great start in
their division of the Western
Pennsylvania-West Virginia
Hockey League. This Sunday is
the first showdown of the year
against cross-town rival
Duquesne. The game is at I p.m.
at the Lakevue Ice Palace on
Route 8 in Valencia. So all ofyou
Panther hockey fans should
make plans to be there. And
ladies, believe the poor guy when
he tells you he plays hockey for
Pitt. After all, the heart you save
may be my own.

Runners head to Va.

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News

On Saturday the University of
Pittsburgh men‘s indoor track team
travels to Fairfax, Va., to run in the
George Mason Invitational Indoor
Track Meet, which takes place at
George Mason University. This is
the third annual meet and also the
third year that Pitt has sent a squad
of runners to participate. Pitt Coach
John Vasvary said, “Two years ago,
when we were first invited, we
accepted but were not sure of exactly
how it was going to be, and it was
not, the best meet that we had ever
entered. But in three years it has
grown into one of the best meets in
the East.”

The meet attracts such eastern
track powers as Morgan State Uni-
versity out of Baltimore and How-
ard University from our nation’s
capital. Other strong squads that
will be running on Saturday include
Maryland, the Naval Academy, East
Carolina, Temple and one of Pitt's
Big East rivals, Georgetown.

The Panther team that will travel
to Virginia will consist of 22 runners.
Although Vasvary looks for the
whole team to make a good show-
ing, he feels that the strongest per-
formers will be turned in by a few
men. This group includes Lee

McRae, who set a new school and
Field House record last Thursday in
the Pitt development meet with a
time of 5.2 in the 50-yard dash. At
George Mason he will be running in
the 55- and the 300-meter dashes.
Other Panthers who are expected to
do well are Roger Thomas in the
400, who set a new Field House
record in the 300 last Thursday;
Jesse Micheals in the 500, Tim
Manes and Alan Laws in the 800 and
standout cross country runner Rod-
ney Giles, who qualified for the
lC4A Championships in March last
Thursday in the I000-yard run and
will be competing in the I000-meter
run.

There will be between 20 and 25
teams and Vasvary said that it is the
kind of meet that coaches like and
that he was no exception. The rea-
son it’s liked is mainly because the
meet is not scored. Each event is
separate and run separately. This
gives the coaches leeway that thev
may not have had if they were shoot-
ing for a team score, because to
achieve the best team score they
would have a tendency to run their
best runners in as many events as
they possibly could.

As for the team events in the meet,
the 1- and 2-mile relay and the 2-mile
medley, Vasvary said that these
events will mainly be used for train-
ing purposes for future meets, such
as the Big East Championships,
which will be scored.

SEATTLE (UPI) — Just like the
Seattle team as a whole, Dave Kreig
has grown in stature this season.
With Krieg quietly emerging as one
of the best quarterbacks in the NFL,
the Seahawks are looking more and
more like a superbowl contender.
People are beginning to compare
Krieg with Miami's Dan Marino.
The Seahawks, meanwhile, have
caught up with Miami as the winn-
ingest team in the AFC. At 12-2,
Seattle has already won three more
games than any other team in the
franchise's history. Krieg has had
greatperformances in his past two
games to help the Seahawks move
into first play in the AFC West. In
wins over Denver and Detroit, Krieg
was 57—of-82 passing for 700 yards
and eight touchdowns with just one
interception.

After Sunday's game, Seattle
Coach Chuck Knox said of Krieg,
“He just keeps getting better and
better. He’s making big plays after
big plays.” Although he doesn’t
always look.pretty at quarterback
Krieg is earning the ultimate acco-
lade of the season — he’s proving
himself to be a winner. The Sea-
hawks have won eight straight
games and are now I9-6 since Krieg
took over for Jim Zorn as the team’s
starting quarterback in mid-I983.

HOUSTON (UPI) -— Third base-
man Bob Horner of the Atlanta
Braves has agreed to undergo
surgery on his broken right wrist and
is doubtful for next season. The
decision was reached at the Winter
baseball meetings in Houston after
Horner consulted orthopedic spe-
cialists Dr. Frank Jobe of Los
Angeles and Dr. Arthur Pappas of
Boston. They concurred that
Homer needs surgery on the navicu-
Iar bone in his right wrist. The bone
hs been broken twice in two seasons.
Atlanta general manager John’
Mullen said “it is very conceivable”

the 27-year-old will not play until
I986.

CHICAGO (UPI) —— Cy Young-
winner Rick Sutcliffe reportedly is
disappointed in the effort by the
Chicago Cubs to resign the right’
handed ace. The Chicago Tribune
quoted Sutcliffe as saying “A lot of
clubsihave offereda lot more than
the Cubs.” Sutcliffe was a I6-game
winner last season for the Cubs and
helped them win the National
League East for the first time in 39
years.

Some more thoughts to ponder
while those stacks of notes stare you
in the eye: ‘

0 Kudos and more kudos to the
athletic department, Coach Foge
Fazio and anyone in Oakland affil-
iated with Pitt football. Your consis-
tency is unusually effective. Within
recent "memory we’ve seen former

‘ women’s athletic director Sandra

Bullman and former basketball
assistant Seth Greenberg “retire.”
Two non-revenue teams, field
hockey and men’s volleyball, have

,- silently disappeared within the last

two years.

As of late, four football assistants
get canned, and still no one has any
business knowing about unloadings.
True, a separate’ entity like Pitt’s

Chipman interjected. “We thought
we were stronger and could out-
power them. That was especially evi-
dent in the the last couple of
minutes," when the Panthers posted
10 unanswered points. M .

“They played well. l’ll tell you
what," he added, “in a way, I'm
happy for them.”

OFF THE BOARDS: Chipman,
a former Lafayette coach himself, is
one victory short of posting his

K 300th as a head coach.

Joey David, hamstrung the first
two games by a 2-of-l3 conversion
rate, from the field, hit for 14 points
and joined fellow guard Demetreus
Gore (12) in double-figure scoring.
Gore, thought-to be one of those

. ﬂash-dash George Allen types, can
do more than dunk. The freshman’s
baseline and outside accuracy
earned him eight points bv halftime.

That 61-58 defeat closed out a
stretch that saw Seton Hall’s Andre

named Big East Player and Fresh-
man of the Week, respectively. Both
stood out in the Holy Cross Invita-
tional, giving the Pirates a 4-0 mark
atop the pre-conference standings.
Of course, Seton Hall had a sim-
ilar December run last year, and
look where it finished up: 9-l9.

0 What kind of outcry would be
heard if Pitt football were subjected
to a five-year plan similar to that
smiting this university?

notice and "order an isolation camera

the final football game of a multi-
year contract. Noticeable sighs

abounded from the athletic castle,

its rulers relieved that the b-o-o-ring
Cardinals would no longer grace the

Maybe they should do an about-

soccer. The Soccer Classic will
open a lot of opportunities for
the local kids.”

According to Moon High’s
Gene Shapert, “This will be the
first time the people of Pitts-
burgh will see our best players on
the sa_me field. We’ve had select
programs in the past, but no one
in Pittsburgh has ever had the
opportunity to see them play. I
think the fans are going to be
excited by what they see.”

June Stroup, president of the
Western Pennsylvania Youth
Soccer Association sees the
Soccer Classic as a positive step
for local soccer. “The event will
provide young players with the
motivation to continue playing
through high school and to work
harder to develop their skills to
all-star level.”

Tickets for the Soccer Classic
are $8, $6, and $4. Groups of 50
or more can save up to $3 a
ticket. For ticket information,

call the Civic Arena box office at
