Golden Flashes shining bright this season

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Coming into the 1987 season, the Kent State
Golden Flashes were coming off a respectable
5-6 record but finished 5-3 in the Mid-American
Conference, good enough for second place.
First place would have given them an automat-
ic bid to the California Bowl, but the Flashes
fell short. and had to chalk it up to experience.

Being picked to finish last in the MAC in a
1986 preseason poll and being one win away
from the California Bowl looked to be an incen-
tive that would carry over into the 1987 season.

However, in the team's first game against
Akron, sophomore quarterback Patrick Young,
who was named MAC Freshman of the Year last
season, was injured against Akron and was lost
for the season. Last season, Young rushed for
779 yards and passed for another 756 yards, so
it was a definite blow to the program.

Fifth—year senior Tim Phillips, a graduate from
McKeesport High School in Venetia, Pa.,
stepped in and has led the Flashes to a 7-3 mark
(5-3 in MAC), throwing for 1,591 yards while
completing 60 percent of his passes.

”[Phillips] doesn't run fast, and he doesn't“

throw too well, but he wins,” said Flashes head
coach Glen Mason.

As for Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried, you
don't have to sell this team to him. When he
coached at Murray State and the University of
Cincinnati, he knew how tough the Ohio
schools could be. Now with Pitt, he can still see
that nothing has changed..

”When you look at Kent State, they're a 7-3

team, and I don't care who you are, but any-
time you're 7-3, you're good,” said Gottfried,
whose Panthers also are 7-3.

”The thing our ballclub knows is that emo-
tions run high. They are a solid program from
a solid league, and we have a great deal of
respect for them.

”We’ve always strived for consistency — we
take every opponent seriously. If we were com-
ing off a loss, it would've been harder  it
would have been different,” Gottfried added.

One other thing about the Flashes. Not only
do they win in the air but on the ground as well.

Eric Wilkerson, a junior tailback from
Cleveland, is the perhaps the nation's best kept
secret. He is currently the nation's a|I—purpose
yardage leader, averaging 198.0 yards per
game. He has 1,180 yards rushing, 262 receiv-
ing yards and 530 yards on kickoff returns for
a total of 1,980 yards. In comparison, Pitt's Craig
”lronhead” Heyward has 1,504 total yards
(1,396 rushing, 191 receiving, 17 passing).

But Mason already knows a little bit about
Heyward —— how big he is. '

”He’s a guy who gets a lot of recognition be-
cause of his size. We watched him on the films,

' and my staff says it reminds them of Pete John-

son [former Cincinnati Bengal running back
known for his huge size],” said Mason.
But as for comparing Wilkerson to Heyward,

Mason acknowledges Wilkerson’s accomplish-

ments but seems to downplay any comparison.

”Eric’s leading the nation in alI—purpose yard-
age. He's half the size of Ironhead [Heyward
weighs over 260, Wilkerson, 181], but he's the
best we have.”

Bowl in
Houston

By Frances Sansig

Managing Editor

According to Steve Kancel, a
section leader of the University of
Pittsburgh marching band, it
looks as though they.wi|l be mak-
ing the trip to Houston for the
Bluebonnet Bowl. »

Pitt received a formal invitation
to the Dec. 31 bowl, which will
be played in the Astrodome fol-
lowing the Kent State game Satur-
day afternoon. ”It looks pretty
promising,” said Kancel.
”They’re re-evaluating the sit-
uation.” . g .-

Last week, band members be-
gan petitioning students and
other Pitt supporters to urge the
athletic department to permit
them to travel with the team.
Football coach Mike Gottfried
was the first to sign the petition.
Also, 64 football players signed
the petition. A

Kancel said section leaders had

been meeting regularly to chart a '
course of action in order to insure

that the band would be included
in the trip. In the past, the band
has attended most bowl games.

”We spend hours up there
practicing. Any time they request
the Pitt band to play at an activi-
ty, we cover it. We use a lot of
our free time,“ said Kancel. He
and the other section leaders had
compiled a list of reasons to
present to students and adminis-
trators stating why they felt the
band should attend.

”Support from the university-

presents a good image of the
university, in that it stands behind
the team and the other functions
which are related. What better
support can there be than the
band being visible cheering on
the team?”

Though the band may be*op-

timistic, Assistant Althletic Direc-

tor Dean Billick maintained
Sunday that ”no decision has
been made yet. It is a financial
decision. We will gather prices,
analyze the budget and make a
decision. If the trip will be a
financial loss, they won't go.”
It has been estimated that it
would cost about $40,000 to

transport the 200-member band .

and its staff.

Pitt Band Director O'Neill San-
ford has stated that he prefers to
take no approach to the matter.

Kancel said the band did not

CMU”to investigate arrests of  

over 100 students in frat raid

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor

There were no fraternity parties
Saturday night on the Carnegie
Mellon University campus — all
were cancelled. That should have
been comforting to Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Braden Walter, who
said he will begin today to inves-
tigate incidents that led to the ar-
rest of over 100 CMU students
early Saturday morning. _

Three PAT buses carted away
the students, charged with vari-
ous violations of the Pennsylva-
nia State liquor law and
disorderly conduct after a state-
city task force raided the Delta

"Tau Delta and ‘Pi Kappa Alpha

fraternities. .

Arrests began at the Pi Kappa
Alpha house which was hosting
a party for charity. A $2 donation
was requested to those who
showed validated university ID.

”It was a $2 donation. We
didn't force you to pay it. Not
everybody paid it. They assumed
we were making everybody pay
it,” according to Evan Kaliner,
president of the fraternity.

[Kaliner, who was charged with
selling beer without a license and
distributing beer to’minors, de-
nied that the donation was being
used to pay for alcohol.

“This type of [charity] party is

".°Fl?‘."8 that hash’: b¢¢n..don¢ 2. 

 

fore,” said Kaliner.

The money was to benefit the
Karin Johnson Asthma Fund and
Muscular Dystrophy.

According" to Kaliner, ”They

. [police] came into the house;

everybody in the way got thrown

up against the wall and cuffed  '

they sealed off all the exits, and
allowed you to leave only if you
showed ID proving you were
21 .” '

Delta Tau Delta had hosted a

charity party the/previous week_

at which they served beer and re-
quested a donation to benefit the
cause of muscular dystrophy.
Students who were charged
were released on their own
recognizance. Kaliner and five

other brothers at the Pi Kappa Al-

pha House along with five
brothers from the Delta Tau Del-
ta house were sentenced to per-
form 15 hours of community
service.

”The six of us [Pi Kappa Alpha]
have a preliminary hearing a
week from Monday. I think the
school's law firm might represent
us,” said Kaliner. r

Fred DeLeon, IFC president at
CMU and also a brother at Pi
Kappa‘ Phi, said he was on the
dance floor when he noticed peo-
ple were beginning to,be arrest-

_ ed. He said he was allowed to-
leave after proving he was 21 and
immediately ran to ‘call campus

police. '

Edmund DeMaar, 22, a brother
at CMU’s Pi Lambda Phi charged
with disorderly conduct, said he
learned about what was happen-
ing in the fraternity across the
quad froma friend who told him
another friend was being ar-
rested. '

”I went outside, and there I see
big PAT buses. They had all kinds
of people leading people out in
strings of three, cuffed together.
We decided to jeer the cops for
their blatant misuse of local
resources  paying them to fight
crime -and not harass. students
who are trying to raise money for
charity,” said DeMaar.

Drinking in the Towers? See page 3

Rob Malan, 20, a Pi Lambda
Phi brother also arrested for dis-
orderly conduct, said he was yell-
ing at policemen when he saw
what was happening.

”We were taken downtown [to
the Public Safety Building],
frisked, and then the charges
were dropped,” said Malan.

”Tbe cell block was a real party
 there were about 25 CMU stu-
dents in the one I was Pin,"
DeMaar_ added. ,

of the raid on CMU’s fraternity

system are evident, ' DeMaar‘

Middle

East

By Chih-Cheng Yen

' Staff Writer

Peace activist and author
Ronald Young gave a lecture at

Pitt last Thursday titled "Missed ‘

Opportunities; U.S. Policy in the
Middle East.”

Young, the executive director.
for the U.S. Interreligious Com-

mittee for Peace in‘ the Middle . 

East, spoke on the meetings he

had with senior political leaders, _‘

of various Middle Eastern coun-
tries and the PLO during his visit

, there in early September, 1987. V _
’’There are signs among all.the I  

parties that peace is possible, as
well as signs of new dangers if
there is no progress toward
peace,” he said. ”Almost every-'
one we met expressed the view
that the role of the United States
is crucial.

”The Middle East is so impor-
tant to so many countries,” he ad-
ded, ”partly because of the oil,

partly because of its location.-

Peace in the Middle East is not
just a regional problem but a
world problem.”

Young stressed the importance
of an international conference
convened by five permanent

members of the United Nations '

Security Council to advise solu-
tions for conflicts in‘ the Middle‘
East.

”In the view of many Arab and.
Israeli leaders who accept the
idea of an international confer-
ence for peace, U.S. policy ap-

pears, at best, to be ambivalent,” 1

Young said. ”Just as U.S. policy
tends to ignore Syria and refuses
to talk with leaders of the Pales-
tinians, U.S. leaders frequently]
talk about an international confer-
ence without any references to
the views of the Soviet Union or

I the other permanent members of

the U.N. Security Council.”
Young spoke on the refusal -by
the United States to accept the
Palestinian principle of self deter-
mination, which most Arab lead-

ers and Israelis see as an obstacle '

to peace.

‘ According to Young,.”As a
number of opportunities for.
movement toward peace came

and went without signiﬁcant U.S. —

support, the credibility of the
United States to be the mediator.

NICOSIA, Cyprus — Iran's!
navy commander claimed Sun-
day his forces fired on four U.S.
helicopters that tried to stop a
gunboat from intercepting a
Greek freighter in the northern
Persian:Gulf.

U.S. Navy officials in the Gulf
denied the attack. But shipping
executives, speaking on condi-
tion of anonymity, said an Irani-
an gunboat fired on the
29,108-ton Greek vessel Jimilta
and searched it for suspected
Iraqi-bound cargo. No damage or
casualties were reported.

Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, claimed the U.S.
helicopters ”dispersed” after the
shooting Saturday. It did not say
if any were hit.

New delays hamper
next shuttle launch

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. —
Manufacturing delays and testing
problems have slowed delivery of

hardware for space shuttle Dis-

covery, and some engineers say
NASA could miss its scheduled

June 2 launch date by several
months.

The biggest bottlenecks could
be the delivery of the primary
propulsion units — the three large
main liquid-fuel engines and the

I segments of the solid-fuel booster

rockets.

The booster rocket segments,
which originally were due from
the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah
in December, are to arrive here
a month late, and four weeks
have been allotted to assemble
them. The main engines have
fallen behind in testing at a site
near Bay St. Louis, Miss., and
they are not expected here until

late December and early January, ‘

a couple of weeks late.

- U.S. officials to check

on Soviet INF sites

SHANNON, Ireland — Secre-
tary of State George P. Shultz said
Sunday the United States and the

Soviet Union had agreed to sta-

tion inspectors at each other’s
missile sites for 10 years after
banned weapons are scrapped.

Heading for Geneva to/try to

wrap up a missile treaty, Shultz
said only ”some operational de-
tails” remained to be worked out.

”The treaty is" virtually com-
plete,” Shultz said. ”All of the
main things have been agreed
to."

The treaty to ban U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear
missiles is the designated center-
piece for President Reagan's sum-
mit, beginning Dec. 7 with
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gor-
bachev.

Faced with that deadline,
Shultz scheduled meetings Mon-
day and Tuesday in Geneva with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.

Man stabs 1 1 people
in Fort Worth church

_FORT WORTH, Texas — A
man attending church services
suddenly walked down the aisle
brandishing a knife and stabbed

up to 11 worshippers before be-
ing wounded with the knife when
congregants subdued him, police
said. '

No one was killed, but the as-
sailant and one of the 11 victims
were undergoing surgery at John
Peter Smith Hospital, said Fort
Worth Police Department detec-
tive Mike Garvin.

”He [the assailant] is in pretty
bad condition himself,” Garvin
said.

The incident took place at
about 11 a.m. at St. Patrick's Ro-
man Catholic Cathedral in down-
town Fort Worth, Garvin said.

”This man was at the church
and during the services did get up
and start stabbing people,” he
said.

”Some people in the church
subdued him, and he wound up
being stabbed himself,” he said.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 23, 1987 .

By Rich Cholodofsky
Staff Writer

The recent arrests at Car-
negie Mellon University frater-
nities have reinforced the fact
that there is no distinction be-
tween university guidelines
and state laws governing alco-
holic beverage consumption.

The fact is, no one under the
age of 21 is permitted to con-
sume an alcholic beverage.

The University of Pittsburgh
Greek System alcohol policy
states: ”As a condition for
recognition by the university,
fraternities and sororities must
fully abide by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylva-
nia regarding the possession,-
consumption and use of
alcohol.”

However, underage drink-

. ing exists to a relatively great
extent on college campuses,
including fraternities.

But why do students choose
to break the law?

Some students say they
drink for social reasons. ’’I par-

ticipate in alcohol consump-
tion for a social crutch,”
according to Michel Better,
19. 0

Paula Getz, 20, said, ”|t’s
something to do on the
weekends. When you go out
on weekends, you drink, in
some cases because of the
frustrations of classes and
stress.”

But others have less serious
reasons for drinking. ”| drink
because I enjoy the euphoric
feeling I get,” said Fiske Ha-
gar, 18.

Alcohol, no matter how ille-
gal for some, is readily ob-
tainable to those who want it
in many cases. Though most
sources require_ identification
before an alcoholic purchase
is permitted, students have
been successful at obtaining
alcohol, using fake lDs to pur-
chase alcohol or having some-
one 21. or over purchase it for
them. _

Fiske said that once alcohol
is purchased, the Pitt dorms
are usually a good place for

consumption.

”They are the most con-
venient, and there is really no
where else to go  It's [just]
more comfortable in the
dorms,” said Fiske. ’’If you're
drinking somewhere else, it's
everyone’s business. You are
susceptible to the law. In the
dorms, it is more my own
business.”

The Pitt fraternities are also
a -viable alternative for under-
age students to drink.

’’I go to fraternities because
I don't want to get hassled by
being carded," said Terri
Garber, 19.

The Office of Residence Life
also handles underage drink-
ing violations. Gerry Kowalski,
assistant director of Residence
Life, said, ”We’re doing as
much as we can. We can't go
actively searching for people.”

If a student is discovered
with alcohol in a Pitt dorm, the
student is required to dispose
of it, and a written report of the
violation will be made.

”A problem is that the desk

Drinking is a favorite college past time.

attendants [who see packages
being brought in] are not al-
lowed to physically search a
person or their stuff. When the
students disguise the alcohol,
there is no way for the desk at-
tendants to know. What we
can do is to continue our ef-
forts to educate students about
the law,” said Kowalski.
The campus police are also
involved in the handling of un-

Underage drinking considered a problem atPitt

derage drinkers. According to e

Walt Waters, assistant director
of public safety, ’’If students
are caught, they can be
charged with underage drink-
ing. But, ifa person is 18 years
old and somehow purchases
an alcoholic beverage, quiet-
ly takes it back to his room or
apartment ‘and consumes it,

’ there is really nothing we can
do.”

 
   

Divorced
woman
wants
orgasm

Q: I am a divorced woman
with years of married sex behind

me — and sex wasn't the reason _ ‘V

for our splitting up. However, I
never did have an orgasm from
intercourse (although I have had
many by myself and by being
pleasured by my partner).

Now I have a lover, and I love
being in bed with him and would
like to have the-special pleasure
of a vaginal orgasm with him.
How should I go about this?

A: I like the way you put it —
you would l,ike to’ have this spe-

cial pleasure with this man.'Very
likely you will in time,'but mean-
while, think about a couple of
things. ‘

First, the distinction between
vaginal orgasm and clitoral or-
gasm is a false distinction. There
may be vaginal contractions trig-
gered by clitoral responses, and
these may be very pleasurable,
butthere are no such contrac-
tions without clitoral partici-
pation.

All female orgasms are con-
nected to the clitoris. I think that
what you want may come if you
let yourself enjoy sex with your
lover as much as you can, forget-
ting about having to have those
vaginal reactions. In the good sex
manuals, several positions are
shown as offering more clitoral
stimulation than others. Try these
and find the most pleasurable for
you both — and relax about hav-
ing the Earth move. It is more
likely to move if you don't expect
it. Sometimes I wish Hemingway
had never invented that ex-
pression.

Q: My husband told me one
day that he had homosexual ten-
dencies, which I had never sus-
pected. I subsequently learned

that he had no realtionships with
_any women before me. He had

hung around exclusively with

gays, he told me, but he said that 7"’

he was not actively sexual with
any of them, though he would go
on trips with them.

I thought he was lying about-
never having been active (he
confessed to being essentially
homo), and it was too much for
me, so we got a divorce. Now he
‘wants toyget back with 'me,. He
now claims that those things he
told me were actually untrue,
and he made them up out of
anger to hurt me. I am consider-
ing the offer, but I think I would
always be suspicious of him and

. that the reconciliation would not

last. What do you think?

A: The reconciliation certainly
wouldn't last if you carry those
suspicions into it. You can't stay
with him ifyou think, every time
he looks down on the street, that
he is scouting for homosexual en-
counters. Therapy might help you
get back together, but don't do it
unless or until you can honestly
agree to put suspicions out of

g your mind.

Students
for excel

lason Stabley
For The Pitt News

At the 1987 chemistry
department's freshman and
junior awards ceremony, re-
cently held in Pitt's Chemistry
Building, 10 Pitt students were
recognized for excellence in
chemistry.

Dr. David Hercules, chair-
man of the chemisty depart-
ment, presented the awards.

Students were awarded for
grades and other achieve-
ments in chemistry during
their freshman and junior
years at Pitt. ’

The first award presented
was the Freshman Chemistry
Achievement Award, given
each year ”to the student
ment in chemistry during his
or her freshman year,” accord-
ing to Hercules.

Students receiving the
award this year were David J.
Wander, of North Hunting-

don,‘ Pa., and Mark A. Rosen-

win chem awards
lence in their field

weig of York, Pa.

Wander, a pre-med student,
has also received awards in
both electronics and computer
programming.

Rosenweig was the top- .

ranked student in his honors
chemistry class last year, is a
Provost's Scholar and holds
Foundry Education and Pitt En-
gineering High Honors
" Scholarships.

The Silverman Award was
presented to Leonard J. '
Malinowski, to recognize ”an
outstanding junior who has
expressjd an interest in
chemistry as a profession.”

Malinowski, a chemistry
major, earned a student affili-
ate membership in the Ameri-
can Chemical Society and a
year's subscription to a techni-
cal journal of his choosing.

”l was very honored to .

receive the award,” he said. ’’I
changed my resume soon af-
ter receiving it. I recently had
interviews with GE and PPG at

‘I lar, a member of Phi Eta Sig-
ma and president of Lambda

Allison Park. They seem to
have an interest‘ in my
achievements.”

Four students were honored
with the Teplitz Memorial
Scholarships, designed as an-
nual cash awards to be applied
toward Pitt tuition of selected
senior chemistry majors with
high scholastic standing.

, Deborah L. Roberts, winner
of one scholarship, ranked at
the top of her junior class.

’’I am very busy,” she said.
”But I still have time for party-
ing and Pitt basketball.’

The Ira R. Musser Merit
Award, given to a chemistry
major who has maintained the
highest scholastic average in
chemistry in his or her junior
year and who intends to enter
chemistry as a profession, was
presented to Todd L. Un-
deriner.

Underiner, a Provost Scho-

Chi Alpha social fraternity, is ‘
also an accomplished violinist. _

They weren't doing
any harm. Really.

On Friday night, about 120 CMU students were arrested at
a fraternity party at the Pi Kappa Phi house. Most of the stu-
dents were charged with disorderly conduct, and a few were
charged with underage drinking. Three PAT buses were need-
ed to haul away the students, with many going along because
their friends had been arrested. ' -.

The jail cell that was to be the students’ home was described
by one student as having a party atmosphere. Few of the stu-
dents will receive a harsher punishment than a few hours of
community service, and the state police have again made the
headlines in their pursuit of law and order. '

There have been some students who complained that the
police were harassing them and that college students shouldn't
be subject to the drinking laws. . -

This, however, is not the case. The law is specific in its defi-
nition of underage drinking. The arrests were legal, and they

were justified in the eyes of the law. Whether the raid was justifi- -

able in light of the numerous other crimes being committed
is a more reasonable question. ’

One has to wonder why this party waschosen for a raid when
underage drinking in colleges, especially at fraternity parties,
has become a part of American folklore and a rite of passage.
Also, there is almost comic irony in that the $2 donations were
to be used for the fraternity’s donations to various charity groups.
An inescapable fact is that 120 college students being paraded

to the police station for a mass booking is a good way to make:

headlines ‘and statements.

We are certainly happy that the state police are taking their
new responsibilities for LCB enforcement seriously..The com-
munities near college campuses will no doubt be safer without
fraternity parties causing so much trouble. Residents may not
be ‘able to expect a report of a stolen , l_evision to be followed

"up, but their sensibilities will be protected.

Making the world  

safe for  what?

Last week, a congressional investigating committee released
its findings concerning the lran-Contra scandal. Just before the
report's release, a minority group of Republican congressmen
made public an opposing report — one stating that the formal
document was the product of inflamatory, partisan bickering.
In it, they seem almost to suggest that the whole affair was not
even a problem at the outset. A

It is interesting to note, however, that while most of the
Democrats and a fair number of Republicans are pursuing a
resolution to the problem along the lines defined by our laws,
there are a few Republicans who continue to defend the ad-
ministration's actions as necessary transgressions. Necessary to
the president's agenda for peace, which we can only assume
is an armed, uneasy and American-dominated peace.

Christmas cheer only $39.99

I went for a walk in a shopping
mall not too long ago. While I
was there, I noticed, actually I
couldn't help but notice, that the
Christmas decorations were up
and that a number of stores had
begun advertising specials for the
holidays. '

I usually do most of my Christ-
mas shopping by collecting box
tops from my favorite breakfast
cereals, and the whole spectacle
took me by surprise. It's no
wonder most of the magic disap-
pears from the holidays about the
time you have to get involved in
the pre—merrymaking fray of
shopping. _

I got to thinking about the
Christmas storiesl had been told
when I was growing up. In
Charles Dickens’ A Christmas
Carol, the Cratchit’s Christmas is
brightened, even in the face of
the loss of their son, by a goose.
Not a new car, not a vacation in
the islands, not a ski trip; only by
a bird for dinner.

Down in Whoville, the Whos

‘ remain undaunted by the loss of

their presents and of their holiday
dinner. Despite the efforts of the
Grinch, the Whos are happy just

MA'l'1'I-IEW
'l'gl-IORNTON

to celebrate the holiday in each
other’s company. It is this sight
that melts the Grinch’s stone
heart.

The most touching Christmas
stories are the ones whic;kh_c‘e',n-t__er
on the people, on the families, on
the love inherent in the holiday.
Charlie Brown was unimpressed
by the bigger, healthier Christmas
trees he saw. He befriended a
scraggly tree, and it served as a
symbol for the ability of happi-
ness totranscend aesthetic judg-
ments of beauty.

All that seemed pretty far away ‘

from the sweating bustle of greed
in the shopping mall. Jewelry
stores proclaimed that a wife or
a girlfriend would love you for a
diamond. There were signs
claiming, ”We know what every
man wants, and know how to
give it to him.” Is this the same
holiday that used to be resplen-
dent with sleigh bells and good
cheer?

Joan Melvin is out

Magistrate Joan Me|vin’s ac-
tions deny any grip on the reali-
ties of an abused woman, but
some of her statements are dis-
turbing to the point of being un-
believable. She says she wants to
”prevent so many women from
calling ’wolf.’ " There is nothing
glib or funny about the.psycho-
logical torture of an abused wom-

' an. [...]

Melvin has clearly lost touch
with reality, and it is doubly mad-
dening to see a woman, well off
and well protected, turning her
back on her less fortunate sisters.

As a volunteer at Women's
Center and Shelter for many
years, I saw .how sad abused
women's lives can be, but also
how full of hope their success sto-
ries are [.,..]. Her comments indi-

imbalance and admit to no un-

derstanding of the brutal facts;

women are afraid to testify
against their abusers, and to
remedy this, she proposes to pun-
ish the woman. [...]

. When an abused woman testi-
fies against her assailant, she does
so under fear _of even worse pain
and violence than before. Her
self-esteem has been worn away
to nothing. It's because of this
cruel psychological dependence
that they so often wind up back
withthe same abusive man. They
wind up depending on him phys-
ically and emotionally, often for
their children's sake.

I

Ms. Melvin livestfiln a fantasy _

It may be that I'm just lament— _

ing the loss of my illusions about
the holiday. I may be upset by
reality shuffling its dirty feet
across my visions of what Christ-
mas should be about — and be-
cause of the money-making
possibilities of it, what Thanksgiv-
ing should be about.

Stores are tripping over them-
selves to make a buck, crushing

the quiet peace of Thanksgiving -
in the process. It's not that any-"‘

one's enjoyment of a holiday
should be dependent on the ad-
vertising surrounding it; it's just
a little disheartening to see that
our most special times are being
trampled in the pursuit of materi-
al gain. '
Somehow, the gifts exchanged

at Christmas have taken on more _

meaning than the gestures of self-
lessness they represent. If nothing
else, I'd like to have a chance to
enjoy Thanksgiving before I'm
cajoled to ”Take advantage of
Christmas savings.” I'd rather
save Christmas, and its quiet,
peaceful happiness.

THE PITT NEWS

CINCINNATI — Rod Woodson
returned his first NFL interception
45 yards for a touchdown Sunday
to lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to
a 30-16 victory in a defensive
struggle with the Cincinnati
Bengals.

Woodson, a college track star
and first—round draft choice,
caught a tipped pass by Boomer
Esiason and used his sprinter’s

speed to outrun pursuit down the ‘

sideline for a second-quarter
touchdown.

It was the biggest play by a
defense that forced three inter-

For the Panthers this season,
the victory over Kent State was a
little different because the game
marked a lot of firsts.

. Craig Heyward’s 259-yard per-
formance,-a career high, made
him the nation's leading rusher of
the regular season. It set Pitt up
for its first bowl appearance since
1983. It was the first time this sea-
son the Panthers played in such
adverse conditions yet didn't let
it bother them. '

Well, maybe just a little.

”The weather wasn't very
good, and neither was -the foot-
ing. The weather dictated our
offense. We just weren't going to
throw,” said Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried. ”We thought we
had a size advantage on the line,
and with Craig, we wanted to
give him the ball as much as pos-
sible. He's very effective under
conditions like these.”

Heyward carried 417times and
scored three touchdowns, also a
career high. His running would
be all the offense the Panthers
would need,‘and he didn't waste
too much time in doing that.

On Pitt's first possession, it

needed only three plays because
Heyward carried three times for
runs of 11, 2 and 58'yards, the
latter for a Panther touchdown.

ca. I’ve said it all along. He broke

For the first time in four years,
the Pitt Panthers know that their
final regular season game will not
be their last one of the year.

Following the Panthers 28-5

win over Kent State last Saturday, ,

the Bluebonnet Bowl officially
extended an invitation to the Pan-
thers, marking their first bowl ap-
pearance since they faced Ohio
State in the 1983 Fiesta Bowl.

After the bid, university Presi-
dent‘Wesley W. Posvar said,
”This is a great. victory for the
players, the seniors and the
coaches. It's a big step in our
long—term program.”

’’I’d like to thank the Bluebon-

net Bowl. We'll be proud to be

a part of your game,” added head
coach Mike Gottfried.

Joe McConn, president of the
Bluebonnet Bowl, said that their
committee has been interested in
Pitt for a good part of the season.

”We’ve been interested in Pitt
since early in the season. They
have a great football tradition.
We like the program, the athlet-
ic director [Edward E. Bozik] and
Coach Gottfried for running a
clean program. They have an ap-
peal to the Eastern TV market,

. and we're bringing an Eastern

team in to play a Southwestern
Conference team,” added
McConn, referring to the general
attitude of football fans in the
South. ’

In terms of Craig Heyward,
McConn said, ”He’s a character.
With a name like lronhead, how
can you gowrong?” .  
“Gottfried was pleased with his
team and couldn't seem to say
enough about going to a bowl
game.

”lt feels real good. At the be-

ginning of the season, you set
goals, and getting to a bowl game
was one of our goalsx
. ”l.’m really happyand thankful.
I count my blessings every night
that we're fortunate enough to be
here. I thank the good Lord to be
here,” added Gottfried.
For some of the Panther

seniors, with this being their last
season, a bowl is an excellent
way to end their Pitt career.
”l’ve never been to a bowl, so
going to the Bluebonnet Bowl is
as good a bowl as any,” said line-
backer Ezekial Gadson. ”lt’s great
just to be going to a bowl. For the

guys next year, it'll be good, and q

hopefully, they'll do better.”
Defensive end Jon Carter also
feels this will be a learning ex-
perience for the younger players.
”This is my first bowl, and for
the younger guys, it gives them
a chance to test the waters, so to
speak,” said Carter. .

PSU upsets Notre Dame,

By Ralph Bernstein

AP Sports Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. —— Coach
Joe Paterno feels better about tak-
ing his Penn State team to face
Clemson in the Citrus Bowl on
New Year's Day.

Paterno’s unranked Nittany
Lions upset seventh—ranked Notre
Dame 21-20 Saturday, boosting
their regular season record-to 8-3
before accepting the invitation to
play at Orlando‘, Fla.

”We didn't want to go to Flori-
da 7-4, if we could help it,” said
Paterno, who in 1983 refused to
take a 6-5 team to a bowl game.

His players felt the same way.

”l-didn't think it would be right
for us [to go to a bowl] coming
off two losses,” said Blair Tho-
mas, who rushed 35 times for
214 yards, scored one touch-
down and set up two others. It

i was Thomas’ seventh game of the

season with 100—plus yards.
Quarterback Matt Knizner
agreed with Paterno and Thomas.
’’I thought it would have been
a letdown if we didn't win this
game. It would have been tough

Austin, who missedthe Kent
State game with a separated
shoulder, should be ready by the
Bluebonnet Bowl game, which is
set for Dec. 31 in the Houston As-
trodome (7 p.m. CST, 8 p.m.
EST)._ ‘

ward to. I V

to get ready for Clemson," Kniz-
ner said.

The Lions — 6‘/2-point under-
dogs — stopped a two-point con-
version run with 31 seconds left,

_to hand the Irish their second loss

in 10 games, spoiling Notre
Dame's national title dreams.
Paterno appeared confident Fri-
day night that his team would
produce an upset, noting the
Lions’ chance to be a spoiler.
”We haven't been in this situ-
ation in a long time,” he said.
The Irish felt they had a shot at
the national crown if they could
beat Penn State Saturday, beat
Miami this Saturday and win the
Cotton Bowl. Notre Dame did ac-
cept a Cotton Bowl bid to play
the Southwest Conference cham-

pion — either Texas A&M or

Texas — on New Year's Day in
Dallas. \

”We’re disappointed at the out-
come,” Coach Lou Holtz said af-
ter the loss, as he accepted the
Cotton Bowl invitation.

Penn State, which had the
Citrus bid locked up, win or lose,
and Clemson will earn $1.05 mil-
lion apiece in the bowl game.

iry for the players, the

Coach Holtz left it up
to us. We couldn't win
the national champion-
ship without a win over
‘Penn State, so he gave
us the choice of going
for two or kicking it.

i — Tim Brown

Paterno said before the game
that his Lions had to play good
defense and stop Tim Brown in
order to win Saturday. The Nitta-
ny Lions did both.

Thomas triggered Penn State's
15—play, 76-yard game—winning
drive that consumed 7:17 in the
fourth quarter. He carried six
times for 32 yards, setting up a
3—yard TD plunge by John
Greene for a 21-14 lead.

The Irish then drove 62 yards
in 12 plays for a touchdown — a

just a sophomore, but it's good
for the seniors.”

1-yard run by Anthony Johnson.
But the Lions’ defense dumped
quarterback Tony Rice on what
would have been a game-
winning, two-point conversion
run.

”We did not play smart in the
first half,” Holtz said. ’’I thought
that in the second half we played
very well with the exception of
the one drive by Penn State.”

Holtz said the weather was a
factor. The wind chill factor was
minus 1, and 25 mph - winds
whipped across the field.

”The cold wasn't a factor, but
the wind was,” said Holtz, who
never considered going for a tie
after Notre Dame's final TD.

”We were going for the win all
the way,” he said.

’’I think Penn State dominated
our defensive line. They gave
Blair Thomas a lot of room, and
he knew what to do with it,”
Holtz said. _ _

Paterno’s defense had its four
starting linebackers for the first
time this season and held Brown
to minus-4 yards on four carries,
four receptions for 80 yards, one
punt return for 7 yards and a kick-

.‘_‘_

off return for 16 yards. He began
the game second in the nation in

all-purpose yards with an average '

of 182.2 yards per game.

Brown said he didn't know
what happened on the failed two-
point attempt.

"Coach Holtz left it upto us,” -

he said. ”We couldn't win the na-
tional championship without a
win over Penn State, so he gave
us the choice of going for two or
kicking it.” .

”We didn't beat them,” he
said. ”Now I have mixed feelings
about playing in the Cotton
Bowl.” 7*

Penn State took advantage of a

stopped on fourth down.

After Kent State's first seven
possessions were all for three
plays apiece, they put together a
13-play drive, highlighed by a 17-
and 10-yard runs by Phillips and
an 11-yard run by Wilkerson,
who came in the game as the na-
tion's all-purpose yardage leader,
but rushed for 33 yards on 20 car-
ries. The Golden Flashes had to
settle for a 34-yard field goal by
Larry Steinberg. The field goal
stopped Pitt's streak of 11 quart-
ers without allowing a point.

On the ensuing kickoff, Panther
return man Michael Hadley was
tackled in the endzone, closing
out the first half scoring at 21-5.

On the Panthers second pos-

,session of the second half, Walk-
er scored on the fourth play of the
drive, a 34-yard run, but it was

called back on a holding penalty.

’’I thought he was going to
score a touchdown every time he
touched the. ball,” said Gottfried.

The next time the Panthers
touched the ball, they started on
the Kent State 31 and made their
way down to the 17, but kicker
Jeff VanHorne missed a 34-yard
field goal.

”There was a miscommunica-
tion between me and Billy Os-
born, just a bad connection,”
said VanHorne.

The last scoring of the day oc-
curred midway through the
fourth quarter, when Heyward
rambled 42 yards for the touch-
down. The extra point was con-
verted by senior Mark Brasco,
who lost his kicking job last sea-
son against North Carolina State
to Jeff VanHorne.

VanHorne was pleased for

Brasco getting one last chance.

”I’m happy for him. He
deserves it, the way he stuck it
out. He's been through a lot of
things some others haven’t,” said
VanHo'rne.

Even though the Golden Flash-
es had their problems, Gottfried
was impressed with Kent State.

”You have to give them credit.
They did a nice job and played
hard. They hung tough and
stopped us on the goal line that
one time. They're well-coached,”
Gottfried said.

Kent State head coach Glen
Mason, whose name is being
mentioned for the vacant Ohio
State head coaching job, was im-
pressed with the Panther defense.

”They’re real good. You don't
go the whole season ranked in
numerous categories if you're not
good,” said Mason.

break the Panthers’ streak of 11
consecutive scoreless quarters.

”We came into the game think-
ing about the scoreless streak,”
said Pitt's Burt Grossman. ”They
got the field goal and a couple big
plays, so we decided, ’Hel|, the
win is a little more important than
the streak.’ ”

0 As halftime drew near, the
band marched onto the track and
was greeted by a barrage of
snowballs from the student sec-
tion. One certain cymbal player
looked ready for blood but was
not hit again. Was it because the
throwers were scared, or wasn't
there enough snow left to throw?

0 Kent State coach Glen Ma-
son, who has been mentioned as
a candidate for the empty Ohio

State job, summed up the game
this way: ”Well, they shut out
Penn State, and we scored five
points, so we're not that bad.”

0 Another offensive hero of the
game had to be Pitt running back

Adam Walker. He carried the ball A

10 times for 56 yards, including
a 19-yard touchdown scamper
and a 34-yard TD run that was
called back for holding.

”I knew I was going to run the
ball, but I didn't know when I
was going to get in,” said Walk-
er. ”Since the coach gave me the
chance early, I figured I had bet-
ter take advantage of it quick. The
cold bothered me a little bit, but
I was used to it. Plus the fact that
I scored the touchdown warmed
me up a bit.”

0 Why is Kent State nicknamed
the Golden Flashes when their
mascot is the bald eagle?

0 Kent State's John Massimiani
led all defensive players with 16
tackles. Pitt was "led by Marc
Spindler, who had seven tackles.

0 This was the last game at Pitt .

Stadium for a number of senior
players. Quarterback Sal Genilla
made an appearence late in the
game, handing off twice to Hey-
ward before beingreplaced by
Larry Wanke. Matt LaVigna start-
ed at fullback; he carried once for
four yards. But the biggest sur-
prise was that much-maligned
Mark Brasco kicked Pitt's last ex-
tra point. It was a fitting end when
the kick was just able to squeeze
through.

scored a 9.05 on the vault, and

sophomore Pat Pollaci also"

scored a 9.1 on'the rings. Senior
Steve Powanda had a 8.8 on the‘
floor exercise, freshman Todd
Probeck scored an 8.05 on the
pommel horse, and senior Dan
Tarosky scored an 8.85 on the
rings.

D’Amico said, ”We are a very
young team, but I'm very optimis-
tic at this point. We should have
a good year, and I think we have
a lot to look forward to.”

Individually, the Panthers had
two gymnasts in the top five.
Gonzalez and Pollaci finished
second and third respectively
with scores on 53.15 and 51.65.

”Everybody did well and con-
tributed. There weren’t many

mistakes. We did better this year
than last year,” Pollaci said.

The Panthers have several new-
comers this season about whom
D’Amico said, ”This is one of the
strongest freshman classes I've
ever had.‘ They all did a good
job.”

One person with a new job is
assistant coach Marty Comini, a
former Pitt gymnast. ”Marty is the
best I've ever had. He's doing an
excellent job, and he's added a
whole lot to our program. He's a
motivator, and he's always posi-
tive. He's an ideal person for the
job,” said D’Amico.

”It was a good meet. We had
strong unity, which showed in
the final score," said Comini.

”We did really well as com-
pared to previous years. In the
past, we were really sloppy in our
first meet, but this time every-
body was confident,” said
Powanda. '

Comini went on to say, ”We
didn't expect our score. It seems
promising for the future.”

”We did a lot better than we
thought we would. But I think we
can do better. We should have a
good season,” said Hasselbrook.

Two negative aspects for the
Panthers’ young season are inju-
ries to key gymnasts. Senior Jorge
Sanchez didn't compete because
of a recurring back problem.
D’Amico said, ”If Sanchez comes
back, we could have a year that
could turn this club around.”
Freshman Damon Difabio tore
ligaments in his leg at a presea-
son practice and is out for the re-
mainder of the season. ”Damon
is one of the highest recruited
gymnasts ever, so our loss of him
hurts,” said D’Amico.

The Panthers open the regular
season Jan. 16 at Eastern
Michigan.
