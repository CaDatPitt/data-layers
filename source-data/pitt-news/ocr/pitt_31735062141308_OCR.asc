’ Started

With excavation w o r k
completed, construction is
now under way on the Uni-

» versity’s $50,000 cyclotron,

located on O'Hara street near the
old Mellon institute.

The atom-smasher, made pos-
sible by Alan M. Scaife's contri-
bution of $50,000 to the School
of Medicine, is being erected un-
der the direction of Dr. Alexan-
der J. Allen, associate professor
of physics. Originated by Dr.
Ernest Orlando Lawrence, the
L225-ton cyclotron is scheduled to
be completed early in 1942.

Digging operations, begun on
July 31, were conducted by the
David Riffle company. .

iDefense priorities will make it
impossible to set any deﬁnite date
for- the ultimate execution of
building contracts. The 40 by 70
foot structure to house the atom-
smasher may have to wait until the
present crisis passes.

The huge electromagnet with-
in the instrument will require 70
tons of iron and 30,000 pounds
of copper. The machine’s purpose

is to synthesize certain radio-ac-_

tive elements from ordinary ma-

terials.

,Despite the defense program’s
threat to an early date of comple-
tion, workmen are even now pour-
ing concrete for the foundation

. walls. Reported as already ﬁnish-

ped are certain details of the base-
ment plumbing and of the first
floor steel construction.

CY Plans Frolic

the Y season since the opening

frolic will take place in the Rho-
dodendron grove in Highland park

of each activity. At the comple-
tion of this period, an entertain-
ment session will take place.

Included in the program will be
songs by the University quartet,
Cap and gown selections, a har-
monica solo by Curt Greenburg,
C44, a skit by Oscar Shefler, C41,

Mary Louise Conover, 43, and Midge Anderson,
C42-—“Although it is easier to handle, this ad-
vantage is offset by its cheaper look and the fact
that the larger amount of advertising makes the
whole paper overcrowded."

Jack Foley, C44———“Smaller and handier to carry,
but harder to read. That loose middle page keeps
getting away from me.”

But along the way Shaw pauses
to poke some innocent fun at doc-

of the artist and morality. The
talk is good, not Shaw’s best, but
good; and after thirty-ﬁve years
very little of it dates,‘ for it has
a universality of idea that saves

it from the doom of social plays

lively. Top honors go to Colin

to Whitford Kane for Sir Pat-

took fourth place to these distin-
guished British.actors, but she
did so graciously. Only Bramwell
Fletcher as the artist, Louis Du-
bedat, lacked fire. But it is diffi-
cult to play a dying tubercular
with ﬁre. '

I suppose in the ﬁnal analysis
it’s Shaw who emerges the win-
net. We all came out of the Nixon
saying that Shaw was still a damn
good playwright; it wasn’t until
the second beer that someone said,
“Cornell did all right for herself,
too.”

These dispatches speak for themselves.
They show to what lengths anti-semitism

"New Writing"

In England there exists even to;

guin Books, which specializes in
publishing popular short books in
paper backed covers. Much cheap-
er in England and _the Empire,
these paper backed books sell now

in the United States fora quarter. 

The latest two‘ to reach these
comparatively quiet shores from
Middlcsex are “New Writing in
Europe” written by John Leh-
mann,. and “The Penguin New
Writing,” an anthology of short
stories, articles, and verses by
several English and French,"new
writer's.”

John Lehmann, who also edits
the latter book, has travelled all
over the continent of Europe in
search of material like that pre-
sented in the “New W1'iting” and
was for-many years anihabitue of
Vienna before the ‘Anschluss. And
besides all; this he is an authority
on the international control of the
Danube, it sayshere.

“New Writing in Europe” is an
excellent . introduction to the
works o:f.men like Auden, Ralph
Bates, Day Lewis, Stephen Spen-

“proletarian” writers. The chap-
ters on poetry, fiction, and the
drama have many valuable and
pertinent excerpts from the writ-
ers discussed.

The anthology, although in a
sense supplementary, does not
measure up to what Lehmann. has
written in his articles in “New

poems by Day Lewis and MacNeice
and an article by Spender on

New Students Aclvisedn-
To Start Year -loll Right 

By HORACE UMBERGER

Nearly everyone in the Univer-
sity has probably been giving out
advice to that unknowing green-
horn, John Q. Freshman, X45.
(Note: X isnot a new division at
the University; rather, it is the
algebraic term for an unknown
quantity.) And since I don't wish
to be an exception in this instance,
I also shall say my piece as re-
gards a phase of. that often enig
matic subject, study. i

Take It Seriously

Now someone might say that
this is a helluva note, mentioning
anything connected with learn-
ing, especially so soon after
freshman week. For during that
time, words of wisdom were pass-
ed on by high university officials
who really knew about what they
spoke. Then, the very next “week,
some punk has to put a lemon in-
to’ this pudding of advice, now
so sweetly flavored with words of
wisdom.

How to Study

At any rate, and be that as it
may, I shallstart off by saying
that any freshman who wishes to
begin college correctly will de-
velop good study habits. The soon-,
er one learns the value of taking
school studies seriously and deter-
mining to master them, the less
difficult will be the remaining
years of work.

As a general statement of fact,
it can be said that a well developed
foundation has great merit. This
is so because mastery of basic fun-

damentals in any line of workv

makes for rapid advancement and

tunderstanding of more

compli-
cated techniques. J A ;
By applying this abstract prinii
ciple to study, book learning ;”~i'n,
later years is facilitated by-ac-s—
quiring proper methods of learn-"L
ing now. 7 

I do not believe that it xvouldjil

 
  
  

5.,-—~

 

be advisable for me to prescribe. 

any given formulas for the de--
velopment of good study practices. .,
Suggestions can be found in, bookish ;
on the subject and each individual.
has his own method of developing

such habits. But now, not in the

senior year, is the ‘time to getia»  

good foundation.

The Summing -Up

The freshman year can be con:
sidered a sort of a formative pen-v

iod in one’s college life. At this
time, John Student gets orien-_».
tated, as the procedure is called;

.,»

He puts his, mind to work in maso » 
tering chemical symbolsand foru 
mulas and in reading about gov-° “ *

ernment in political

science; * ‘

Then, when the semester closes, 

his scholastic record will show..
the results of proper study hall-_;

its at the end of the semester.  ‘

Do It Now
By all means, one should
est himself in some outside activi-,

musical

inter~ 

ties, . such as fraternities, clubs,
organizations, and the]
publications. For, by participation..»

in these events, the student gains, 

invaluable personality training,

learns to work with other-s and?
learns to accept his share of re? 

sponsibility. ' . . . .
But I remind you,_once more,
Mr. and Miss Freshman, X45,

that you should get to work im--
mediately. Don’t leave thosestexiti
books to collect dust in some folgc
gotten corner of your locker.

, By combining the development
of water color as a medium for il-
Iustration with the history of the
taste of the American artist of
the past and present century, the
current exhibit displayed in the
"Fine Arts gallery presents an at-
imosphere of vibrant color har-
ptnony.

fdium with its transparent washes

from Cezanne’s but founded on the

this to water colors.

against the economic problems of
serious illness, the Student Health

ance. This includes 21 days of
complete hospital care effective af-
ter the first semester fee of $2.50

tion insurance, a seriously ill stu-
dent will receive room and board
in ward accommodations for 21
days each school year in any of
Pittsburgh’s largest hospitals.

The patient will also have the
use of the operating room as often
as necessary, ordinary drugs and
medications, necessary dressings
and casts, routine laboratory ser-
vices, and ordinary x-ray.

Policies for student hospitaliza-
tion may be obtained in the Men’s

Research Plan

To Aid lndustry
Started at Pitt

After numerous requests from
various industrial firms, the Uni-
versity this summer established a
research division in the Schools of
Engineering and Mines to conduct
technological investigations of spe-
cial concern to the industrial, en-
gineering, and public interests of
western Pennsylvania. . A

In explaining the new division,
Dean E. A. Holbrook stated that
the division will attempt to unify
and promote this work. Eight re-
search projects already are under
way. " 1

An executive staff composed of
Dean Holbrook as director, and
heads of eight departments in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines
will be responsible for general
policies governing the work of the
group.

Dean Holbrook further stated
that an expansion of the present
ﬁnancial policy, under which funds
are received from cooperating pri-
vate and public agencies, will be
undertaken..

The division will publish and
distribute bulletins on the results
of research.

mony between the band and the

Campaign for members to the

Realizing the need for bigger

other interested groups, telephone
him SC 9484 after 5 o’clock to

statehient we nieed only to point
to the brilliant case history of one
John‘ Brosky. Up until the time he
was a junior at Pitt, Brosky never
really considered the possibilities
which track offered. In fact, he
never had the slightest idea that
someday he would don a Blue and
Gold track suit.

Then the urge to run came to
the now outstanding Brosky. He
decided to go in for cross coun-
try and track. He wanted to win a
varsity letter, and ti‘ac}gpi"eseiited
a fine chance. The rest is known
to everyone. Constant practice un-
der the very able Coach Olson has
made Brosky one of the best dis-
tance runners. in the East.

Among the long list of Panth-
er greats Coach Olson has pre-
sented to followers of track are
such famous names as Dick Mas-
on, Johnny Woodruff, Al Fer-
rara, Johnny Bazylr, and the cur-
rent sensations, Hap Stickel and
Bill Carter. All, no doubt, came
to Pitt with plenty of natural
ability, but all were the direct
result of the expert handling of
Coach Olson.

When -one considers the ‘difficul-
ties which confront the good na-

tured Olson, he can ‘scarcely stop

“Blues” triumphed over the

[preserve “Whites”, 26-7, last

Saturday in the first fall
iiitra-squad tilt’ of the season.

Stetler did all that was
expected of him and more for he
ran wild on the Pitt practice ﬁeld,
contributing three scores for his
Blue teammates.

Jack Kerr, sophomore fullback,
started the game for the Whites
and plunged over for a tally in
the second quarter, then replaced
Ross in the first team lineup in the
last quarter and evened it up.

Extra-point

conversions were

made by Johnny Stahl, Joe.Con-
nell, and Tex Hinte.

Line play showed the greatest
improvement in the Blue team,
for, at times, it looked practically
invincible. Stanley Gervelis and
Steve Sinclair nee Sinco were the
only varsity linemen. from last
year to start the game.

Sinclair Nee Since A

Last spring Sinclair had quite a
bit of trouble with the accuracy
of his snapbacks, while Gervelis
has always been a little shy on
catching passes, but both boys
seem to have mastered their faults
and are looking forward to a great
season.

Harry Kindelberger and George
Mitchell were the newcomers on
the left side of the line. Both boys
are seniors and played on the sec-
ond team last fall.

Kindelberger has’ a big job
'ahead,. and that is taking over the
position vacated by Ted Konetsky,
While Mitchell seems to be the
likely replacement for Rudy
Gradisek. "
Crissman Makes Grade

Bob Crissman and Vince Anton.
elli started the fray on the line,
and proved themselves to be very
cabaple. Antonelli alternated last
year between second and third
team, while Crissman will be play-
ing his last year for Pitt.

Crissman moved into a ﬁrst
team post last spring when Bill
Beﬂghauser was threatened by
draft. Benghauser has been ‘re.

to wonder how such great Panther
teams, have developed. Tostart the
list of drawbacks we need only
mention that the track facilities
are not the best that could be ob-
tained.

The sore spot in the Panther
setup is the lack of an up-to-date
indoor track house. At present,
Pitt athletes are somewhat hinder-
ed in their efforts by inadequate
space. For a large university such
as Pitt, the situation is undesir-
able and needs correction.

Track is not the only thing
that makes Coach Olson interest-
ing, however. What attracted us
to him was his friendly and help-
ful attitude to any student that
he met. One didn’t need to be for-
mally introduced to Coach Olson
to get to know him, but rather to
see him or to nod as pleasant greet-
ing.

Regardless of how the record
book may show the events of Pitt
track teams, we will always know
that Panther track men are suc-
cesses. For, in addition to teaching
his boys how to be better runners,
Coach Olson is also a hioulder of
men.‘“His boys are champion gen-
tlemen as‘ well as champion ath-
letes. _

BOB CRISSMAN g
Uncle Charlie Needs Him

Connell was a varsity letterman
in his sophomore year at fullback
po-sition, but last year fell down
considerably. This fall, after a
shift to right halfback he has been
going great guns.

Promising Sophomores

Durishan, Broudy, and Salvucci
are sophomore prospects, and fig-

ure to get into a number of games’

this fall season. All three boys
have enough weight to carry them
through a varsity grind, but lack
the essential experience of a vet-
eran player.

Happy Stickel,
champion, gained an additional 10
pounds during the summer, and
now scales 174.

Stickel was added to the squad
with the sole idea of using him as a
spot runner, but his all around
play in fall practice stamped him
as a dangerous man for opposing
teams. .

In his high school days, Stickel
was one of the most versatile ath-
letes to ever come out of MsKees
Rocks for he earned his letters in
track and football.

Coach Charlie Bowser will con-
tinue sending his team through
practice once a day, until the open-
ing tilt of the season. As far as
intra-squad games are concerned,
Bowser plans to schedule one for
next Saturday morning.

_I1}J'uries have been kept to a
minimum thus far this season, and
the coaching staff have their ﬁn-

gers crossed for the next week and
a half.

.And as the season wore on, the

space of one week-end, the Panth-
ers took a double thrashing ad-

State and Rider.

It seemed as though the Grady-
men were back in the victory

'With the fall intramural sports
program nearing its start, frater-
nities, engineers, and indepen-
dents anxiously toe the mark.
‘Teams are being organized in each
league; the main job being that of

~ ﬁlling the gaps caused by the loss

' of men through graduation.
Every entry will be out to dis-
lodge last year's champions in
their respective leagues. With this
as one incentive, the other will be
trying to get as many out into
the open of the playing field as
possible so as to offer every man
relaxation from scholastic duties
and a chance for physical develop-
ment.

On the fall intramural schedule
are touch football, speedball,
badminton, and paddle tennis.
Touch football, as usual, should

ireceive the greatest number of
entries. Speedball, a very fast
and interesting game, is expect-
_ ed to run touch football a close
second. ‘I’

groove once more, when the boys
downed Penn State, 46-29. But the
hope was only momentary, as
Franklin and Marshallhanded the
Panthers defeat number four the
very next week. -

Not even the most optimistic
well-wisher could hope for a ﬁrst,
second, or third place in the East-
ern Collegiates after a competi-
tive record like that.

But Coach Ben Grady must
have worked a bit of his “Michi-
gan magic” on the swimming
squad. Because at the ECSA meet,
the Panther mermen managed to
ease into the runner-up spot. And
except for the one-sided superior-
ity of the Rutger aggregation, Pitt
would still be Eastern Collegiate
swimming champion. 1

Rutgers will still be favored in
the ECSA race this year. Like Pitt,
the champions have been cut very
slightly by graduation. Add to
that a year of experience and sev-
eral very _competent newcomers,
Rutgers looms as a very tough
team to beat. I
Veterans Return

Some of the veterans returning
for more aquatic action with the
Panthers are Herb Cosgrove, Joe
Orloff, Joe Kaule, Bob Soles, Mar-
ty Kramer, Al Fedor, and,Gus
Wilde.

squad, Orloff, Wilde, and Kaule

ry Paffrath, and “Leffy" Ziol-
kowski were the victors. The AB
&ME team of the engineering
circuit came through and were
crowned champions in their
league.

In the first game of the play-
oﬂ“s, the Punks were pitted against
the strong Phi Gamma Delta
squad. Sparked by such men as
Ziolkowski and . Paffrath, the
Punks could not be denied a vic-
tory. With a passing attack that
seemed to baffle Phi Gamma Del-
ta’s secondary, the Punks rolled
up a total of 19 points to their
foe’s nothing.

Carlson Gives Punks

Next on the Punks’ list were the
AE&ME men of the engineering
league. The Punks showed that
they were real champs by taking
this one to the tune of 27-7, and
copping the intramural toga. .

Only the fraternities entered
teams in speedball competition.
Practically the same men that
were on the touch football teams
were entered by their respective
chapters. After a very exciting
battle, the Phi Gamma Delta boys
ﬁnished on top. '

The Phi Kappa Alpha team
made a desperate bid for the win-
ner’s position but had to be satis-

ﬁed with second place in the ﬁnal '

standings.

Fraternities also dominated the
paddle tennis playoffs. With men
like Deutelbaum and Hirsch to
spur them on, the Phi Epsilon Pi
team emerged victorious over the
rest of the ﬁeld. Phi Delta Theta
ﬁnished second, chiefly through
the efforts of Black and Ferris.

Dr. Leland D. Baldwin, acting li-

brarian of the University, told of
three continuous nerve-wracking
d.ays and two sleepless nights in
Mexico as if hewere still tired.

In the town of Taxco, during a v~

religious festival, Dr. Baldwin
spoke of the stay as one that could
have been pleasanter, much pleas
anter. 3
“The town just seemed to be giv-
en over to pandemonium,” he de-
clared, “there were two brass
bands in the cathedral yard, that
blared every day and night. I
must say they weren’t very mu-
sical. When one got tired the
other took oVer.”
Dr. Baldwin explained that the

church was a social institution in V 

Mexico. It takes
movies, clubs, and dances here in
the United States. The religious
festivals as the native’: entertain-

ment are their only diversion, so
the» Indians and farming classes
enter into them with their heart
and soul.

“The happy peasants, their
stomachs laden with the native
beer; pulque, (alcoholic content
3.5 per cent) danced, yelled, and
shot off fireworks to their heart's
content.” Dr. Baldwin stated there
were slight lulls between midnight
and dawn.

In a more serious vein Dr.
Baldwin said he was most im-
pressed by the very low standards
of living throughout the country.
To him these conditions seemed
to have been caused by the con-
stant religious and social fer-
ments, politicians, and the lack of
trained Mexican technicians.

Most technicians are imported
Americans or Europeans who
have been more interested in de-
veloping oil wells and natural
resources than improving the con.
ditions of the country.

Summer Workshop Airs
Difﬂculties in Education

Remember all those things you
used to whisper about your high
school teachers——called them “old
fogies,” and worse?

Well, now the pupils are shout-
ing them from the roof tops! Yes
sir, someone ﬁnally came right out
and said all those things you had
planned to say “after the grades
are in” or “the day I graduate,”
and then never got around to.

It all happened at the “Summer

Workshop” for educators conduct-
ed by the University this summer.
High school students, their par-
ents, and their teachers, experts
on education, and guest speakers
all attended and discussed the ed-
ucation system in the schools. And
they got results. The teachers have
even published the criticisms in
their monthly bulletin.
Complaints were much the same
as they were when girls had ink-

dipped pigtails. Most of the em-
phasis was placed on the fact that
they are too old-fashioned in their
ideas.

Teachers also heard that they
often betray conﬁdences, look un-
attractive, and hurry home too
soon after the last class hour. And,
of course, the students complain-
ed about the “teacher’s pet” sys-
tem which has always caused trou-
ble. '

After panel discussions, stu-
dents went home feeling that
teachers can be human; and teach-
ers “realized as never before that
students are people with likes, in-
terests, and feeling” to quote Miss
Helen Booth, who wrote the article
for the “Teachers’ Bulletin.”

them to go right up and tell those
