Ah! Leah!

lri s rocks Flagstaff H i ll

By Ann Salerno
For The Pitt News

”Love is like a rock!" People were
up on their feet screaming in unison
as Donnie Iris held the microphone
out to the crowd. Students from Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon University
gathered on Flagstaff Hill yesterday
to -hear the rock band from Pitts
burgh.

’’I think that Donnie Iris isa good
draw,” said Dave Weinstein of the
Pitt Program Council, who sponsored
the event along with CMU. ”He’s
really popular around here.”

The hard rock band 18 Names
opened up for Donnie Iris and the
Destroyers. lris then‘ began by sing-
ing ”Agnes.” It wasn't until the first
encorewhen he played ”Love is Like
a Rock,” however, that the crowd got
up on it's feet.

Iris’ second encore was ”Ah |eah,”
and the students rushed to the front
of the stage, clapping their hands
above their heads and echoing the
screams that the singer belted out.

lris wore Levi's and a white cotton
shirt, along with his customary black
framed glasses. He jumped around
the stage in black canvas converse
high—tops.

”I had a lot of fun out there,” Iris
said. ’’It was a nice loose atmos-

_phere.”

The audience responded
to his actions on-stage. He threw his
fist in the air and they did the same.

”|t’s a lot different from an indoor
concert,” Iris said, ”it’s not so tight,”

Iris didn't have a lot of security and
the students had a chance to meet
him after the concert. About 20

Students For a Free South Africa

raising consciousness among

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer .

The University of Pittsburgh
Students for a Free South Africa
will be demonstrating against apart-
heid one week before a board of
trustees meeting in an effort to raise
student and community awareness
about its ongoing divestment
campaign.

”We’re definitely trying to promote
consciousness-raising among
students,” said Ellen Dorsey, a Pitt

_ graduate student in political science
and a member of SFSA.

The organization was formed last
year and has already been involved
in several anti-apartheid protests.
Dorsey said that so far the protests
have accomplished two things. They
have focused attention on students
and have put pressure on Pitt's board
of trustees.

Although the board has responded,
Dorsey believes that ”it was
thoroughly inadequate and too late
in coming. The claim that they
haven't studied the issue enough is
absurd.” She said the issue really
started 10 years ago.

Dorsey said that ‘Pitt president
Wesley Posvar’s view is that the
university should not take the lead in
policy making, and that they should

The. trustees heard impassioned pleas from a
South African minister...not only did they not
vote for divestment, they did not even vote on

the issue.

-Ellen Dorsey

follow the lead of the U.S.

government.

She contends that the greatest
fallacy is believing the idea that if we
divest in South Africa it will hurt
those whom we want to help the
most. ’’I think we should listen to the
people in South Africa instead of
making that judgment for ourselves,”
said Dorsey.

”The trustees heard impassioned
pleas from a South African minister
. not only did they not vote for
divestment, they did not even vote on
the issue,” she said.

Dorsey explained that although the
amount of money Pitt has invested in
South-Amca nas decreased from $37
million to $14.9 million, it is not a
result of direct divestment from Pitt;

instead, certain corporations Pitt had
invested in decided to divest.

No members from Pitt's board of
trustees or the board's investment
committee could be reached for
comment.

Responding to an article that ap-
peared in the University Times alleg-
ing that there are too few black
students and faculty members at Pitt,
Dorsey said that it is obviously affec-
ting the anti-apartheid campaign
because blacks are most likely going
to be moresensitive to the issue.

She said that the appointment of
Dennis Brutus, a former South
A rican political prisoner, to the posi-

, tion of director of black studies ”can’t

help but affect the administration.”

students

However, she maintained that,
”My major concerns are that those in
the Pittsburgh community and sur—
rounding areas become informed
about South Africa and become in
touch with their role in the move-
ment. 1 want people to say, ‘As a
member of the Pitt community I
should be aware of Pitt’s divestment
and I should be doing something
about it.’ ”

Dorsey expressed mixed feelings
about a new Pitt divestment commit-
tee‘ that is holding a press conference
today to announce its formation;
”The committee is no substitute for
responsible action from the board,”
she said. _

Apartheid is ”institutional racism.
And the anti-apartheid movement is
one that absolutely transcends
political barriers,” said Dorsey.

SFSA is currently seeking en-
dorsements from hundreds of Pitt-
and community-related organiza-
tions, and although it is aiming for
outside support, Dorsey said that it
is no substitute for support from the
Pitt community.

Last year about 700 people turned
out for the major anti-apartheid pro-
test, and this year it is estimated that
several thousand will demonstrate. ’’I
can't ask the students to get involved

enough,” said Dorsey.

students got autographs, and some
had their picture taken with him.

Iris said that his band will be com-’

ing out with a new album soon, and

said they will be changing record-— 

labels.

”We have enough material for

about two albums now, but we have
to sort through and pick out our best
songs,” he said.

up at the entrance to the PPC movies.

We put them where we thought the - ‘T

most people would see them."

Weinstein said the PPC chose Don-
nie lris and the Destroyers because
they thought Pitt students would be
interested. - -

”We wanted someone who would
appeal to the students,” he said.
”And Donnie Iris is really popular in
Pittsburgh.”

The event was sponsored in part by
CMU, and Carnegie Mellon student
Sean McCune said they hope to get

a national act to play at Flagstaff later .

this year. The act will probably not
be a Top 40 band, though.

”We’ll still have mai_nst"r'.eanfi7"

music,” McCune. said,”but
mainstream music on our campus
isn't Top 40.”

Pitt freshman Tom Conley said if
they have the chance to get a major
band, then they should try for a
popular ‘one. \

”They’d get a lot more people if
they got a really popular band,” He
said. ’’I think they should go for a Top
40 band.”

Drinking
ydechnes

By Stacey Carlitz
For The Pitt News

Since the implementation of
dry rush there have been fewer in-
cidents of‘ underage drinking in
Oakland, according to police and
residentgassistants. .

Fewer people have been ar-
-rested for intoxication and
underage drinking, and fewer
raids have taken place since dry
rush was implemented, according
to the Pittsburgh Police.

Jayce Palmer, an RA in Tower
C, said ”So far in my experience,
there hasn't really been more
alcohol on my floor. I think a lot
more people are going to apart-
ments and outside bars.”

Another RA, who asked that his
name not be used, said he
thought that there was actually
less alcohol over the past three
weeks and that it is a result of the
dry rush policy. ”l’ve been an RA
for two years now, and I'm a-
mazed to see the decline of
alcohol consumption on my
floor.”

One student, who also asked to‘
remain anonymous, said,”|t’s
good to have dry rush because
you get to know the people on a
sober basis.” ~

Soviets release Daniloff to embasssy custody

WASHINGTON — U.S. News and
correspondent
Nicholas Daniloff was freed from a
KGB prison Friday and placed in the
custody of the American ambassador
in Moscow.

His release comes after U.S. of-
ficials agreed to a deal which freed
both Daniloff and Soviet citizen Gen-
nady Zakharov

The release of Daniloff from the
KGB prison does not, however,
represent a dropping of the espionage
charges presently held against him.

A Senate leaders were delighted at
the news of Dani|off’s release into the
American ambassador’s custody, but
reaffirmed their conviction that there
will be no outright swap for the two
men's freedom.

Another American
nabbed in Beiruit

WASHINGTON — For the second
time In a week an American was kid-
napped in Beirut. Joseph Cicippio
was kidnapped Saturday morning
from his apartment at the American
University where he was the deputy
comptroller.

No group has claimed respon-
sibility.

A witness says five gunmen
sneaked onto campus and locked up
a guard. They then struck Cicippio on
the head and carried him to the car.

Israel shipping U.S.
arms to Iran

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Israel
has been shipping U.S.-made
weapons to Iran, the Danish Sailors
Union said this weekend.

Israeli officials in Jerusalem refused
to comment, and U.S. officials in
Washington said it was against U.S.
policy to supply American-made
weapons to either side in the Iran-Iraq
war.

According to U.S. law, it is illegal
for a country that receives American
armaments to sell that equipment to
a third nation. It was not known
whether the arms the union officials
said were shipped to Iran were sup-
plied to Israel by the United States.

Henrik Berlau, a union spokesman,
said that the Danish freighter Ilse TH
carried four 900-ton shipments of
weapons from the southern Israeli
port of Eilat to an Iranian port in the"
Strait of Hormuz.

Preben Moller Hansen, chairman
of the sailor's union, said that the in-
formation was not disclosed earlier

because it would have made the Ilse
TH and its crew a potential target of
Iraqi warplanes.

Both Iran and Iraq have attacked
and seized vessels bound for enemy
ports in a bid to interdict the flow of
arms.

Israel has been previously accused
of supplying Iran with weapons for
its war against Iraq.

In 1980, Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon of Israel unintentionally
disclosed that Israel had sold

$12-million worth of spare parts to -

Iran, including badly needed tires for
U.S. made F4 Phantom jets.

Israel said it had stopped sales of
arms to Iran under pressure from the
United States, which is Israel's largest
supplier of arms.

Since 1980, both Israel and Iran
have denied any arms transactions,
although last April, retired Israeli
General Avraham Bar-Am was
charged by the United States with
plotting to obtain $2-billion worth of
sophisticated weapons for sale to
Iran.

Pakistan lays blame in
hijacking

PAKISTAN — Pakistani authorities
have laid the blame on an army
sharpshooter for the bloodbath dur-
ing last week's hijacking of a jumbo
jet. '

They say the sharpshooter wound-
ed the leader of the hijackers when
he briefly walked out on the wing of
the jumbo jet and then ordered his
men to open fire on the hostages.

Twentypeople were killed and
150 were wounded during the in-
cident.

The new information comes as
high ranking Pakistani officials say
that a tip from the FBI led to the ar-
rest of a Libyan official suspected of
playing a key role in the hijacking.

Investigators think the Libyan was
the~most important link between the

hijackers and the accomplices now.

Gimbels shuts

Pittsburgh employees-shoppers faci

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

t was the end of an era.
The last sales pitch

came out through a small

”Ampli—Vox,”
sounding much like a Bingo night
at a fire hall, or a cattle auction at
a county fair.

Shoppers, please see the fourth
floor for fixtures. Get two-for-one
buys on shoes and household ac- ,
cessories. Buy one item, get a sec-
ond of equal or less value for free.

On the fourth floor, artificial
Christmas trees wrapped in plastic
greeted customers as they topped
the escalator. As one turned the

corner off the escalator there were

dozens of Burroughs computing
machines for sale, left over from
an earlier, happier age.

Mannequins, once enlisted to
display items for sale, were now
sold to the nearest college student
looking for some odd decoration
for a dorm.

Clerks, who had been with
Cimbels for literally decades,
stood behind outdated cash
registers which replaced the
modern computer checkout system
when the store began to liquidate
in June. Above them, signs
declared all items 80 percent off.

Angelo Milburn, 49, a sales
clerk for 30 years at the store,
stood among the six chairs and
several remnants of carpet that
represented the furniture depart-
ment and thought about what had.
transpired in thirty years. .

’’I thought l’d be here the rest of

. Peters Pub
 Our Kitchen Is

my life. I really like coming in
here," he said. ”l’ve gotten to
know so many people through this
job.” '

Milburn said he met his wife

when he sold her a pair of shoes. '

”l waited on her in August of
'58, and we were married in June
of '59. it really was a storybook
romance.”

When Milburn started at the
store, the Gimbel Brothers still
controlled the chain. By the early
1960s Cimbels was solidly estab-
lished in New York, Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh, as well as many
other cities across the east and
midwest. The late '50s and early
'60s brought record growth and
the heyday of the department
store chain.

According to Milburn, the
downfall began when the chain
was sold about 10 years ago. It
was then that Batus lnc., based in
England, took over the chain.

”| used to be bitter [about the
sale],’’ he said. ”We used to wait
on every customer as an in-
dividual‘. Then the new people
[Batus lnc.] decided to go after the
big ticket customer.” -

He said the new ownership
didn't have the same concern for
the employees as the Gimbel
Brothers had. It took some of the
love and respect for the job away,
according to Milburn.

"You hardly ever saw them,”
Milburn said. "The Gimbel
Brothers would be here at least
once a month. The new people,
you'd be lucky if you saw them
once a year.”

You went there not only to shop,

Fifty-eight year-old Louise Jeffrey

She said she doesn't think the
fact the store has closed for good

employees. _ ‘

she said. ”Fifty-two years. It's very

The final day ended at four

o'clock, and it took a half-hour of , ’- 
repeated announcements from Lyn - 

Goebel, the store manager, to
move people out of the store.

Most of the clerks on the final
day were people who had been
there for years. .

Jeffrey said she stayed on
because she was asked to. Each
week the management would ask’
the employees if they would like
to stay on another week. Most of
them chose to do so.

When the store was finally
cleared of customers, many of the
sales clerks and managers were
gathered on the first floor, milling
among themselves and the empty
display cases, staring at each
other; looking a little bit lost.
Some wiped their eyes.

A weekend war
zone at Pitt

The time has come for officials of‘ both the city and Pitt
to recognize a ticking time—bomb and disarm it before it
goes off.

An area in south Oakland, where Forbes Avenue meets
Bouquet Street, is quickly becoming a weekend war zone.
Seldom does a Friday or Saturday night pass without an
incident occurring in the general vicinity of this in-
tersection. 1

The cause could be one of many possibilities. One
glance, however, and the viewer notices one distinct
possibility. ‘

The area has become one where both Pitt students and
non-Pitt students alike tend to congregate. This creates a
very tense atmosphere when egos, pride and alcohol all
meet at the same time.

The campus police have recognized the problem, but
simply posting a guard in front of the law school does not
remedy the situation. Granted, the number of drinking
establishments in the area does not help, but that cannot
be offered as an excuse.

Simply stated, the area must be cleaned up. The best
way to to solve a problem is to take care of it before it
happens. Medical professionals refer to this as preventive
medicine. More active patrolmen would be the first step.

It is not a rare sight to see two police officers on the
corner of Bouquet and Forbes prior to a fight. In the same
sense, it is not uncommon to see eight police officers on
that same corner after a fight. By then, however, the cof-
fee break is over, and it is too late.

Nick Daniloff
spurs tug of war

The Daniloff case is finally making some progress. He's
not home yet, but he seems to be a little closer today than
he was last week. That's wonderful news, but it does have
its negative side. While an American journalist in Soviet
custody anxiously awaits his release, a Soviet spy in
American custody awaits his own.

Some people feel that giving back one of their spies is
a small price to pay for the safe return of one of our own.
And to an extent it is, but it sets a dangerous precedent.
If the Soviets were to extend the logic of this arrangement
every time we arrest a Soviet for spying, then they could
grab an American and trump up charges that he is also
a spy.  

The Reagan administration must remain strong, but in
the same frame of mind, it must not sacrifice relations and
the chance for further peace talks because of Nick Daniloff.

Paperwrong in dry rus

As a student of the law and an avid
reader of The Pitt News, I would like
to congratulate the editorial staff for
achieving a feat I thought impossible.
In postulating underage drinking as
a legitimate exception to the Penn-
sylvania State Liquor Law that pro-
hibits persons underthe age of 21
from consuming alcohol, the editorial
staff has reached new heights of
editorial irresponsibility and new
depths in the degradation of logic and
reason.

After thorough examination of the
applicable statutes concerning the
sale and consumption of alcoholic
beverages in Pennsylvania, I have
been unable to locate any exceptions

LETTERS

that would_permit fraternitiesto serve

alcohol to underage undergraduates.

An extension of the logic used by
The Pitt News would have the use of
recreational drugs in fraternity houses
be an exception to the Pennsylvania
Criminal Code simply because
”fraternities have used them for years
with no problems.”

I can, however, recognize the
vested self-interest of the editorial
staff of The Pitt News in assuring the
continued inebriation of the student
body, for it is only in such an altered

state of mind that the students will no
longer be able to recognize The Pitt

News for the rag that it is.

of ways. We come in all shapes and
sizes. But, and this is a crucial ”but,”
we all have a way of categorizing

‘ every person we see.

Let's take a walk through the
Towers lobby and I'll show you what
I mean. As we enter through the
revolving doors on the Forbes
Avenue side, we see people on our
left taking copies of The Pitt News.
I think to myself, ”job security." You
probably think, ”something to read
in class.” As we continue toward the
steps, we see students bleeping and
blerping on video machines. We, as
intellectuals,-think, ”toy-brains.” A
computer science major would think,
"great modem.” Mr. Spock would
think, ”fascinating." We finally reach
the steps. There are several people

vith new clothes, unblemished ID’s
and a dazed look. Everyone thinks,
"freshmen.”

I'm sure that you get the point.
Each one of us has this little network
of brain cells that can instantly place
anybody into one of a multitude of
categories. This, my friends, is called
stereotyping. It's a system based on
a person's experiences, his social and
political biases, his favorite kind of
clothing, whatever is cool in his cir-
cle of friends, etc.

I'm sure that some feminists have
a stereotype about me because I've

 

' I 6.3.
PATTERSON '

been using ”his” and ”he”as imper-
sonal pronouns and left out ”  or
her" and ”  or she.” But that's OK,
I have a stereotype about them.

You see, there is nothing wrong
with stereotyping, if it is only used as
a means to place people. It can,
however, cause problems when it is
used to judge people. That's where
the line must be drawn.

A freshman is most vulnerable to
stereotypes at Pitt. In fact, he is
vulnerable to just about everything
(now there's a nice stereotype). He
(or she, OK?) comes to Pitt and sees
more different people than ever
before. His brain, lest it burn out, tells
him that he must stereotype all these
students. He sees a football player
and thinks, ”dumb jock." He sees a
pretty girl and thinks, ”ooooh
boooy!!” He sees an engineer and

thinks, ”geek.” He sees a male
cheerleader at a football gameand
thinks, ”wimp.” He sees the cop and
German shepherd outside of the ”O”
and thinks, ”I didn't really want
cheese-fries anyway." He sees
himself and thinks, ”Tom Cruise.”
Those are some pretty mild ex-
amples. Still, stereotypes can hurt
people's feelings and have lasting im-
plications. So go ahead and put
everyone in his or her respective
place. Just don't let them know where
they've landed.
And always

remember that

stereotypes, no matter how sure you -

are of a person, can be very wrong.
I mean, everybody thought Richard

Nixon was a crook. Uh  bad exam- s

ple. OK, remember when Dolph
Lungren of Rocky IV and Grace Jones
fame came into our lives? Everybody
thought that this Adonis type was just
another dumb blond. Well, aside
from being a European kick-boxing
champion and training Swiss soldiers
in self-defense, he holds several
graduate degrees and is a financial
whiz. I was guilty of placing Dolph
in that ”dumb blond" category,
though I'd never tell him so. I do
readily admit my mistake, but now
I have a new reason to hate him —
he's perfect. There's a reason to
stereotype Grace too — she's stronger
than Dolph.

So, again I say, be careful. Not on-
ly can you make a costly misjudge-
ment about someone or something,
but you can also make yourself look
bad. And goodness knows that you
don't want that to happen.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 15,

Fact or fiction? The beer with lime in it

Today's episode is not so much a
column as it is a mystery story.
It is the mystery of Corona beer.

In great portions of the United-

States, Corona beer has become the
fad of the year.

It has been happening at its most
fervent since the beginning of the
summer. Restaurants and bars all
over America are running out of Co-
rona beer. The restaurants and bars
are sending out for emergency de-
liveries.

Corona is a beer imported from
Mexico; it comes in a clear longneck
bottle with a painted label. It seems
that everyone between the ages of 21

. and 45- is drinking the stuff. And not

only do they drink it; they drink it in
the exact same way.

You can observe it time after time.
Some guy will sidle up to the bar.
He'll say — very casually —- "Let me
have — uh — a Corona." As if he
hadn't made up his mind before he
even came through the door.

Then the bartender will say, "Want
a glass with that?"

Why is

God does not smile upon my ‘rela-
tionshio with Pitt's math department.

I have had classes with five math
professors during my undergraduate
years here, and four of them have
been foreign guests of President
Posvar’s "International University”
where overseas students and re-
searchers are invited to teach and
conduct research at Pitt. This quartet,
although possessing some mastery of
the English language, all have prob-
lems speaking coherently enough for
students to understand the lectures.

Not that these professors lack any en— 4

thusiasm about teaching their classes
— they are obviously brilliant
mathematicians who all care enough
to devote time to working with
students in class and answering ques-
tions in their offices afterwards. It's

" the language barrier that has led to

at least four frustrated instructors and
many students with low grades
(grades that reflect the students’ abili-
ty to learn material solely from a math

Well, it's mid—September and the
leaves are about to change. No real

tough tests are coming up just yet. »

You're on easy street so far. While
you've been easing your way into the
term, we at The Pitt News have been
racking our brains putting this paper
out.

So, it's quiz time.

I'm up in this newsroom almost
forever, so my source for the quiz will
be this paper.

Pencils ready. Begin.

1.) What is the first thing a
freshman does when arriving on
campus?

a.) Runs out to look for a mentor.
b.) Tapes a campus map and a copy
of his schedule to his notebook.
c.)Finds out what bars are lax on IDs.

2.) What is the most informative
part of The Pitt News?

' a.) Page one.

b.) The classifieds.
c.) Dr. Ruth's column.

3.) What law was broken most
often in the first two weeks of the
term?

The guy will say —— again, very
casually — "Nah. Just give it to me
in the bottle.”

And then he will add the kicker:

"l'll take a lime with that.”

The ritual continues. The bartender
sticks a sliced lime straight-up into the
neck of the bottle. The customer
squeezes the lime until all the juice
has seeped~down into the beer. Then
— and this is crucial — the customer
takes his finger and pushes the rind
of the lime into the bottle. He drinks
the beer, and when he has finished,
the lime rests at the bottom of the bot-
tle, like a dead frog.

The same people who used to play
with Hula Hoops when they were
children are taking part in the equal-
ly contagious Corona fad this year.
You go into some places, and every
person at the bar has been sucking
on Coronas-with-limes.

At one bar, the doorman showed
me a newspaper clipping about Co-
rona. The clipping said that 14
million cases of the stuff are expected
to be sold this year. And one of the

The language problem among in-
structors seems to reside primarily
with Pitt's math department, although
when I mentioned to a friend that my
math professor sounded like Pee
Wee Herman speaking Russian, he
responded, "Hey, are you sure that’_s
not my economics teacher?”

Now I've heard that progress has
been made with removing math TAs
who speak English poorly from
teaching positions — a change due
in part to the valiant efforts of
numerous CGS students who
demanded tuition refunds if the in-
comprehensible foreign instructors
were not replaced. Yet I'm being
taught by a tenured professor who
needs to master verbal English to
communicate with his American col-
leagues, let alone with his students.

Are you facing a similar situation?
What does one do?

The best way to avoid non-English
speaking instructors is to make sure

a.) The seventh commandment.

a.) Ronald McDonald.
b.) Colonel Sanders.
c.) Roy Rogers.

tending Pitt football games this year?
a.) Walking up the hill to the stadium.
b.) Bettingon field goals of 25 yards
or less.

c.) The band's "new uniforms.

7.) What proposition changed the
lives of countless college students this
year?

Another bartender said, "The

people do you know who ever drank
limes with their beers before? But
now 100 percent of our Corona
customers order it with that lime
stuck in the top. It's ridiculous, if you
ask me, but if one person does it,
then everyone has to do it."

One evening I was in a Chicago
establishment called the Hard Rock
Cafe. The Hard Rock, even though it
is new to Chicago, is reputed to be
the Corona capital of the city. Rumor
has it they employ one person just to
cut the limes.

noxious, crusty, disagreeable, old in-
structor who will at least pound
something into your skull.

If you're already enrolled in a class
with an incomprehensible professor,
change to another class with another
professor (hopefully Eng|ish-speak-
ing). Or, hold off on taking the course
until another semester when another
instructor is teaching. Don't fool
yourself into believing you have to

Pitt for an education, not frustration.

If you absolutely cannot drop out
of the foreigner’s class, make the best

A Staff Writer

While Americans take fitness
seriously, the Russians take
it one step further. Dedicated to the
health of the ”total organism,"
physical training begins in the Soviet
Union as soon as a child begins his
formal education and is maintained
throughout a lifetime. The serious
athlete being trained for a specific
sport.might attend the famous Sports
Institute. Athletic ability is not the on-
ly qualification for admission into
one of the 23 schools. Academics
play an equally important role at the
Sports Institute. The student attends

W classes from 9-5 each day; academics

take up the morning while the after-
noon is devoted to sports training.

Pitt alumnus George Panzak

‘ recently had the opportunity to study

at the main Sports Institute in
Moscow. One of approximately 50
students, Panzak was enrolled in a
graduate course designed to re-teach
the building of an athlete. The Rus-
sian coach had a level of prestige
higher than that of a doctor, Panzak
said. Merit is measured by the
number of champions they coach.

One aspect that helps the Russians
’ build champs, according to Panzak,

IS their method of injury-avoidance
training. The first step is setting up a
definite mental concept differen-
tiating short- and long-term goals.
Preparation periods that do not in-
volve competition are limited strict-
ly to the second phase, auxiliary
exercises designed to reduce injuries.
Panzak pointed out that the Russian
coaches expect their athletes to come
to practice already in shape, not to
get in shape. The third phase is
specialized training which brings an
athlete closer to actual competition.

Competition is the final aspect in
the development of an athlete. Sur-
prisingly, there isn't a lot of burnout.
According to Panzak, the training
periods are alternated with periods
called ”active rest.” These periods
last for 2-3 weeks and introduce
unrelated sports into the program
already established. Coaches make
this change to refresh the
athletes as well as to maintain the
development of the muscles and
organs not used in the athletes’
chosen sport.

Another aspect of the training is the
introduction of speed strength at an
early age. Speed strength is the com-
bination of quick, explosive motion
and strength. This is utilized not on-
ly in shot putting, but also weightlift-
ing, behind which there is no solid

The Russians almost have to have
expansive injury prevention and in-
jury restoration programs. According
to Penzak, there is little reliance on
medical restoration in the Soviet
Union. The Russians at the Sport In-
stitute deny the use of steroids, op-
ting for a mainly ”physical from day
one” restoration program. The
Soviets believe that physical reha-

possible following an injury. De-
pending on the type of injury, that
particular part of the body is
exercised out and then built back up
after surgery.

One aid in the restoration process
is a new food supplement called
Superspectrum, developed by Dr.
Anthony Picesti. Superspectrum in-

cording to Penzak, and is 100
percent absorbable. Whilemedical
restoration plays a small role in the
Soviet sports network, Panzak noted
the Russians were extremely pleased
with this vitamin. Picesti was able to
combine vitamins B,C,E and iron
compatibly within Superspectrum.
The one capsule has a 12-hour time
release leaving no need to take
several pills 2-3 hours apart as with
other supplements.

Currently, Panzak is re-training Pitt
transfer (from Notre Dame) football
player Art McG|othen, utilizing the
techniques he learned while in the
Soviet Union.

McG|othen said that the main dif-
ference between the new system
presented by Panzak and his previous
training methods is the fact that
muscular endurance, rather than
bulk, is the main aim. McGlothen
was used to a primary movement
body-building method, which includ-
ed the use of heavy weights and low
repetitive training.

McG|othen noted that he is a little
more tired after his workouts than
with previous training programs but
that Panzak's program had few other
drawbacks. '

In this spirit, General

as J efferson’s concern for in-
dividual rights clashed with

rebellion in the countryside

Not Madonna
Singer opts for ”metal look”

By Dave Zafris
News Editor

lad in a black body-
hugging mini skirt, the
platinum-blond lead
singer of 18 Names
screamed out the vocals of Led
Zeppelin’s Misty Mountain Hop.
But some people in the crowd at
yesterday's concert at Flagstaff
didn't seem all that enthusiastic.

’’It seemed like everybody
wasn't awake yet,” said Karla
Goldman, a Pitt graduate turned
rock singer.

Some students were apparently
waiting for Donnie Iris and were
just curious. Others were clapping
wildly because they were hearing
music they recognized.

’’It was great hearing Led Zep-
pe|in,” said Pitt junior Brad

ZZZPEE7

Stevens, ”they sounded really
good. I don't think new bands
have to play all new music,
because no one would recognize
it."

The band played Have a Cigar
and Wish You Were Here by Pink

Floyd, another band that Goldman «

said fits in with the image of 18
Names. A

”We’re definitely a live rock
band. We're not a synthesizer
band — we have real drums,” she
said after the show. -

Goldman, who graduated from
Pitt in 1981 as a communications
major, was dressed in black
fishnet stockings to compliment
her blackfishnet shirt.

”|t’s kind of a metal look,’’ she
said. ’’I’m trying toiwear lots of
leather and belts. I like to wear

“ PERFORMANCE PIECE!‘

leather biker jackets, but it's too
hot to even consider that today.”

Goldman's earrings swayed as
she spoke, bumping into her face.
Small metal strips dangled from.a
design of pink cloth attached to
beads in her ears.

’’I know, they look like >
chandeliers. It was really tough
when I was singing because they
kept banging into my face,” she
said.

’’I’m definitely trying not to lool
like Madonna," she- said with a
grimace.

She said they are putting
together material for an album.

”We just have to find a record
label. We have enough material
for about two albums, but we
have to choose our best ones for
recording. Hopefully we'll have a
record out sometime this fall.’'

Dance ensemble flourishing

By Judi Potoka

For The Pitt News

The beauty and grace of a dance
production is something few people
take the time to appreciate.

The constraints of limited funding
and little recognition can be
discouraging, but Susan Gillis
Kruman, through the dedication and
determination of her dancers, is able
to find optimism in a world of which
most aren't aware. .

”The arts are alive and well at the
University of Pittsburgh,” said
Kruman, the Pitt Dance Ensemble ad-
viser, who is beginning her ninth year
with the troupe. ‘ ' S

The 15-year-old ensemble will
begin its performances on Nov. 18,
19 and 20 at the annual Health Fair
sponsored by Student , Health
Services.

The Pitt dancers, along with three
members who attend Carnegie
Mellon University, concentrate on
ballet, jazz and modern dance but

have performed all types of dance —
from tap to African.

' According to Kruman, the dancers
will continue to reach toward their
goal of presenting themselves and
their works in a professional manner.
One way she hopes to increase the
level of professionalism is through a
choreography workshop sponsored
by Pitt to be held Nov. 21.

Dancers from Slippery Rock
University and Indiana University of
Pennsylvania will participate in the
workshop.

This informal workshop will give
the dancers an opportunity to meet
and observe each other’s dancing.

In late January, the ensemble will
go on the road to perform in a pro-
duction sponsored by Slippery Rock.
That university's dance troupe will

likewise perform at the Pitt ensem- ~

ble’s concert slated for April 3 and 4.

Plans for the ensemble to perform
a_t the Community College of
Allegheny County's South Campus
are still in the works.

A COME SEETHE REAL

AT
The Pittsburgh

No matter what their individual
skill levels may be, the dancers have
the same reason for joining the
ensemble. They want to dance.

One member of the ensemble,
Lynn Rescigno, a junior communica-
tions major, has been dancing since
she was four. ’’I wanted to continue
in college,” Rescigno said. ’’I like to
stay busy. If I stop, I don't dance
well.”

She won't be using her dance ex-
perience when she graduates but she
continues to dance for fun.

Rescigno would like to see more
students attending the ensemble’s
performances. ”Usua|ly, just the
dancers’ friends come,” she said.

Kruman would also like to see
more recognition from the universi-
ty community. ”We do exist," she
added.

Until that ‘recogniton comes about,
Kruman said that the ensemble will
continue to work to, ”spread the
dance word to as many people as we
can.”

Internationa food: etnic flavo

By David Zuchowski »

Sta ff Writer

The phrase ”Gr'eat Scot” is a mild
expletive. It's on the order of ”My
|ands,” ”O my gosh,” ”Gee whiz,”
and ”Dagnabit,” — phrases usually
used in heated emotional moments.
Fortunately, the Great Scot Res-
taurant, 413 S. Craig St., is deserving
of more than just mild expletives. Ac-
claim is more in order. V

The restaurant's name is more like-
Iy derived from its proximity to the
Carnegie Institute. If you were to ask
the average Pittsburgher who our
most famous Scotsman is, nine out of
10 would probably reply Andrew
Carnegie.

There's a Scottish flavor to the
decor; plaid-vested service personnel
and framed wall pictures suggest an
origin in or around Edinburgh. A
tastefully conservative, almost
Caledonian color scheme contribute
to the overall effect. The menu,
however, is eclectic and interna-
tional. With items such as Penn-
sylvania chicken noodle soup,
Indiana chicken fingers, Cajun pan-
blackened catfish and Chinatown
salad, the ever-changing menu caters
to an assortment of regional and
ethnic tastes.

Light eaters might like to try the
Crunchburger with bean sprouts,
water chestnuts and soy sauce actual-
ly mixed into the beef and then
grilled the way you, like it.The burger
was named Pittsburgh's best by the

‘ Phantom Diner on Evening Magazine

just last year.

I began my repast with a sample of
steak tartare ($3.95), freshly ground
filet mignon topped with a raw egg
yolk, with sides of anchovy filets,
chopped raw onions, capers and
whole grain mustard. By far my
favorite appetitizer on the menu, the
tartare was enjoyable down to the last
morsel.

Next came a» platter of various
goodies. The marinated scallops
wrapped in bacon ($3.95) were
bathed in a sugar and brandy sauce,
then broiled. The coconut-beer
shrimp with sweet and tangy sauce
($3.25) proved to be a tempura-
textured cocoon that blanketed the
plump juicy prawns, and were further
enhanced by a homemade orange
marmalade-horseradish-mustard
sauce.

If you want to taste real chicken
nuggets try the Indiana chicken
fingers ($3.25). The tender, oblong
morsels were complimented by the
accompanying sauce of cherry jelly

Great Scot

  
   

Scott Carnahan/The Pitt News

The Great Scot restaurant is both ethnic and international.

and whole grain mustard, which
tastes better than it sounds.

Soup lovers take notice! Great Scot
has three to choose from and they
change from week to week. I
especially liked their presentation of
all three served in separate monkey

E dishes on a large plate. Of particular

interest was the Tri-melon soup, fine-
ly pureed cantelope, watermelon and
honeydew mixed together, topped
with a scoop of each of the three
fruits and served chilled.

One of the lunch crowd's favorites
came next — the Chinatown salad
($3.95). Chunks of chicken breast are
sauteed in oil, along with shredded
lettuce, scallions, celery, bean
sprouts and slivered almonds, then
finished off with a dusting of sesame
seeds and doused with a lemon-soy
dressing. Once I overcame an initial
prejudice against eating a warm
salad, I settled back to enjoy what
proved to be one of the evening's
highlights.

A trio of entree offerings ensued.
Many people who wince at the very
thought of liver might even like the"
way it's prepared at Great Scot. Un-
doubtedly a good grade of liver goes
into the dish, for it was virtually free
of sinew and gristle. It had a wonder-
ful delicate flavor, and was gently
sauteed to a fork—tender finish.
Topped with diced, cooked bacon,
sliced apples and onions with a hint
of vinegar (the waiter insisted that it
was white wine), the liver peasant
style ($10.95) should be loved by
people who like liver and liked even
by those who don't.

Adventurous eaters might want to
try the pan-blackened catfish. The
Pisceanfilet is powdered with red,
black and white pepper, garlic and
onion salt, then cooked in a red- hot
cast iron skillet and blackened on
both sides by the intense heat. My
two previous encounters with this
style of Cajun. cooking‘used sword-
fish and redfish, but the catfish
proved to be my favorite.

Lastly I tried the_Fish of the Day
($11.00), a grilled swordfish steak. If
the fish is very fresh, which it was,
and grilled to a perfect finish (not dry
and overcooked or chewy and under-
cooked), then even a rank amateur
can become a gourmet cook when
preparing this dish. Splashed with a
mild orange sauce with slivered
almonds, the swordfish was so good
that it would have brought tears to
even Nero's eyes. All of the entrees
are served with seasonal vegetables;
mine were sauteed green beans
mixed with tomatoes and a choice of
either pasta with cream sauce or
potatoes rissole.

If you want to finish off the meal
with ruffles and flourishes, try the
bread pudding with whiskey sauce
($3.25), one of the unchanging menu

items. No ordinary bread pudding,

it's the bread pudding, a sensual
climax to a great meal. The large,
heated square of moist, raisin-filled
dessert was covered with a translu-
cent, buttery whiskey sauce and is
guaranteed to please even the most
disparaging detractor. The bread pud-
ding alone is worth a trip to Great
Scoﬂ

An unfashionabletie

Panthers

lose lead
with :55
remaining
By John Enright -

Assistant Sports Editor

For 55 minutes Saturday night the
Pitt Panthers manhandled the North
Carolina State Wolfpack before a
crowd of 47,200 in Carter-Finley
Stadium.

But the last five minutes turned in-
to a living nightmare for the Panthers,
as the Wolfpack rallied from an 11-
point deficit to earn a 14-14 tie.

After the game Pitt players and
coaches alike were stunned at the
turn of events which affected the out-
come of the contest. Panther coach
Mike Gottfried took the loss especial-
ly hard. And for good reason. Pitt's
first-year coach istrying to erase the
unpleasantries of the Panthers’ last
two seasons, when many games were
lost or tied in the fourth quarter.

However, on Saturday Pitt reverted
to its old ways, playing well, but not
well enough to win, which is exact-
ly what plagued Pitt in its 10-7 loss
to Maryland three weeks ago.

That is what has Gottfried worried.
”We have a lot of problems that we

. have to solve,” said Gottfried. ”We

have to develop an answer for them.
I don't know what the problem is.”

The Panthers didn't have any prob-
lems in the first half. Pitt took the
opening kickoff and drove 78 yards
in 13 plays, scoring on Craig
”lronhead” Heyward’s six-yard run.
During the drive, Pitt quarterback
John Congemi was exceptional, three
times completing passes on key third-
down plays to keep the drive alive.

The score remained 7-0 until late
in the second quarter. The Panthers
pinned the Wolfpack deep in their
own territory, forcing them to punt.
The punt was short, and Teryl
Austin's nifty 13-yard return gave Pitt
the ball at State's 26-yard line. Faced
with a third and 11 at the 12-yard
line, Pitt fooled everyone, abandon-
ing an obvious pass situation. Con-
gemi handed off to tailback Charles
Gladman who broke three tackles
and scampered into the end zone to
give Pitt a deceiving 14-0 halftime
lead.

The Panthers totaled 200 yards in
the half, and were it not for 63 yards

Three defensive players injured against N.C. State

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Notes from a disappointing tie with
North Carolina State:

0 Three Panther defensive players
sustained serious injuries in the
game. What makes that even more
disheartening is the fact that all three
are starters. Defensive back Teryl
Austin has a sprained knee and will
be out at least six weeks. Two
sophomores, lineman Anthony
Siragusa and defensive end Burt
Grossman, were hurt. Siragusa has a
sprained ankle and will be out for
three to four weeks, while Grossman
has a sprained knee and he will be

on the sidelines for one to two weeks. .

.°An interesting note is that
Siragusa was hurt in the first quarter

and was in street clothes by halftime.
As you may know, Siragusa was Pitt's
backup kicker for the game because
Mark Brasco and Pat Viancourt didn't
make the trip. If Jeff VanHorne would
have been injured, who would have
kicked?

It's understandable that Coach
Mike Gottfried has more important
things on his mind, but don't count
on him bringing only one place-
kicker on future road trips.

0 Senior wide receiver Chuck
Scales broke into 10th place on Pitt's
all-time receiving list. Scales’ three
catches for 25 yards gives him 975
yards receiving for his career. Mean-
while, John Congemi needs only 97
yards of total offense to move into
third place on the Panther's career
total offense list behind Dan Marino

Mike Cofer kicked a 49-yard field goal for North Carolina State to tie Pitt.

and Tony Dorsett. Congemi current-
ly has 4,796 yards total offense.

0 Junior tailback Charles Gladman
had a helter—skelter performance in
the game. Gladman ran for 140 yards
on 22 carries and caught four passes
for 32 yards. But the 5-11, 205-pound
back fumbled in the fourth quarter,
and he also dropped a beautiful pass
from Congemi in the second quarter
for what would have been a
touchdown.

Overall, Gladman played well and
showed why he is one of the better
running backs in the country. He also
moved into ninth place on Pitt's
rushing list ahead of Tom Davies.
Gladman now has 1,777 yards
rushing for the Panthers.

0 Pitt has now had one tie game in
each of the past four seasons. That is

the greatest number of consecutive
years in which the Panthers have had
a tie game.

0 N.C. State kicker Mark Cofer
broke a school record for the
Wolfpack. His two field goals Satur-
day night give him 10 consecutive
field goals without a miss. Cofer has
made an amazing 40 out of 54 career
field goal attempts.

0 Sophomore Reggie Williams is
quickly establishing himself as Pitt's
best wide receiver. Williams caught
12 passes for 115 yards against the
’Pack. His two-game totals read 16
catches for 206 yards and one
touchdown.

0 Despite his troubles in the fourth

quarter, freshman John Rasp punted .

well. Rasp punted eight times for a

 

39.3 yard average.

0 Junior defensive back Billy
Owens played an excellent game for
the Panthers. Owens, who is a former
running back, made 11 tackles (seven
unassisted), two for losses, and in-
tercepted a pass. He did a superb job
containing N.C. State's option
offense.

Seniors Tony Woods and Lorenzo
Freeman also played well defen-
sively.

0 For the second consecutive game
Pitt dominated the stats. The Panthers
had an edge in first downs (20-10),

Thoughts from a fun—filled
weekend of sports:

The Notre Dame Fighting Irish
seem ready for a return to the days
of glory they enjoyed under legen-
dary coaches like Rockne, Leahy and
Parsegian. Lou Holtz, in his debut as
Notre Dame head coach, did

everything but win against Michigan.

And the Irish would have won had

‘ it not been for a blown touchdown
. call.

_ 
BOB

TRAVERS

Notre Dame receiverjoel Williams
of Gateway High School in
Monroeville caught a touchdown
pass at the back of the end zone that

_the officials called out of bounds. The

replay showed that Williams was, to
quote John McEnroe, ’’clearly in.”
There is no reason for the NCAA not
to use instant replays, the -way the
NFL does.

The point is, the Irish looked good
on Saturday, and I'm glad they did.
College football isn't the same
without Notre Dame in the Top 10.
Now if only USC could get back on
track.

I went to a high school football

game Saturday afternoon. It was the
first time I had been to a high school
game in three years. Not much had
changed. Quarterbacks still can't
throw, linemen still can't block, and
kickers still can't kick. But, hey, other
than that, it was great.

Do you think Brian Davis misses
playing high school football? I bet he
does.

This high school football stuff
reminds me of a story. I was at a
game in Indiana three years ago.
West Lafayette High was playing
Twin Lakes. The game was at West
Lafayette’s stadium, and it happened
to be the Red Devils’ Homecoming
game. I was sitting in the student sec-
tion surrounded by a bunch of kids
I didn't know from a hole in the head,
but they sort of looked like kids I
went to high school with, so I just sat
there with them, listening to their
conversations and keeping an eye on
the game.

West Lafayette scored just before
halftime to take a 14-0 lead. The
game was going along kind of slow-
ly, but I figured the Homecoming ex-
travaganza would make up for it.

I was right. A blast oftrumpets Cut

signaling the entrance of the .

Homecoming parade. First came the

Something
Unheard Of.

The National security Agency’s
Professional Qualification Test

Don't even think of limiting your employ-
ment options...because we wouldn’t. At the
National Security Agency, we've devised a Pro-
fessional Qualification TEST (PQT) that might
prove just how perfect you’d be for an unheard
of challenge—an NSA career.

Your job would be important to our job. We
analyze foreign communications. We safeguard
this nation’s vital communications. We secure
government computer systems. All using
tomorrow’s state-of-the—art technologies. All
for a very good cause: America’s National
Security. A

The PQT is your first step toward qualifying
for one of the National Security Agency’s
career fields. If test results indicate good poten-
tial, an N SA representative will be in touch to
set up an interview. You’ll have the chance,
then, to explore the particulars of oppor-
tunities in data systems, information science,
language, communications and management.

So do something smart for yourself. Pick up
the PQT bulletin at your placement office. Or
write to NSA for a copy, soon. Registration is
free, but forms must be received no later than
October 10th. Test date‘? Saturday, October 25th.

If you’re a graduate with a Bachelor’s or
Master’s degree in Electrical/ Electronic/ Com-
puter Engineering, Computer Science, or a
Slavic, Near Eastern or Asian language, you get
a break; no test necessary. Just schedule an in-
terview with our representative through your
placement office.

Give the PQT a chance to prove what you can

 N.C. State game, the Storm before the calm

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September l5, I986

Saturday night the Pitt Panthers tied
the North Carolina State Wolfpack
14-14 in a game that the Panthers
should have won.

Pitt dominated play for the first
three and a half quarters of the game,
only to see the Wolfpack, aided by
some Panther mistakes, storm back
to tie the game.

Pitt was stunned. To say that they
were disappointed is an understate-
ment of the highest degree. N.C. State
felt as if they had won the ballgame,
while the Panthers felt as if they had
lost.

People who have followed Pitt-

football the last four years probably
weren't surprised by what happened.
Remember, since the Penn State
game in 1983 when the Nittany Lions
tied Pitt 24-24 on a last second field
goal, the Panthers have blown a lead
and eventually lost or tied their op-
ponent a total of eight times in the
final three minutes of the game.
Eight times Pitt has led its opponent
with a mere three minutes left in the
game, and eight times Pitt has either

‘tied or lost that game.

  Who would go to a Pirate game in September?

Yesterday, I decided to get away
from campus and the reading that I
had to do for a while. I hopped on
a bus and ended up in Market
Square.

I noticed there were a lot of'peo-
ple walking towards the river and
wondered where everyone could be
going on a Sunday afternoon. Before
I had a chance to ask someone what
was going on, this little kid in a Pirate
hat came tearing by me yelling
something about a sweatshirt.

Well, since I was already
downtown, I decided to see where
this kid was going. I followed him
through Point Park and was stunned

Starting tailback

I.....'.....,..,.,.....g..,,,,,,,..,...,....,-.,.v

This is no one's fault in particular,
although many fans love to point a
finger at former coach Foge Fazio.
What it is is a rollercoaster effect. Pitt
unfortunately tied Penn State in that
1983 game and then went to the
Fiesta Bowl and lost to Ohio State on
a touchdown pass with 40 seconds

i left in the game.

The following year Pitt lost its
opener on national television to
Brigham Young on a 51-yard
touchdown pass with two minutes
left in the game. The players lost their
confidence. They stopped believing
in themselves.

From then on Pitt would play great

football, and when the fourth quarter .

rolled around they would wait for
something bad to happen. And most
of the time something did.

That trait was very evident on the
1984 and 1985 Panther teams. They
were playing not to lose, rather than
playing to win.

The scenario that took place Satur-
day night in Raleigh, N.C., would in-
dicate that things are still very much
the same: Pitt has replaced the old

to see so many people.

There was a man in a white tank-
top and cut off jeans carrying a pillow
and another man in heans carrying
a thermos. I saw a‘family with three
kids all between-the ages of 3 and 7
and all were crying for lunch.

I crossed over the bridge and went
to the stadium. I then proceeded to
wait for 15 minutes in line at the
ticket office.

When I finally got my ticket and
went to the gates, I realizedthere
were no more sweat shirts. I couldn't
believe there were so many people
that all the sweat shirts were gone.

I decided since I already had paid

coaches with" new ones [with the
same problems], the players are the
same, and they are still "undisciplin-
ed and lacking in confidence. People
may believe that Pitt still doesn't have
what it takes to win.

Those people are wrong. These.
players aren't losers. They are win-
ners. Their attitudes are great, and
they have what it takes to win.

‘ for the seat, I might as well stay for

the game.

Once I settled into my seat armed
with a program and pen, I was ready
to see the Pirates play.

It so happened to be my lucky day.
I was blessed with the presence of an
older lady who liked to talk about
everything.‘ '

Everyone has heard of "the calm

before the storm”; well, I think the

tie to N.C. State was a case of ”the
storm before the calm.”

The players suffered through a
heartbreaker Saturday, but they
shouldn't worry or doubt themselves.
Their mental strength was severely
tested in the game. But if they believe
in Coach Mike Gottfried as much as
this writer does, they will react
positively against‘ Purdue this
weekend and win.

Everyone is looking for a scapegoat
right now, but there isn't one. Gott-
fried may be at the head of many
people's list, but he should only
receive praise. Yes, the Panthers are
0-1-1, although they should be 2-0.

But Gottfried has done a superb job
so far. He has instilled a new sense
of pride and confidence in the.
players. He has handled the offense
well. It is true that Pitt has put only
21 points on the board in two games,
but they have shown a good deal of
potential. Gottfried loves to throw the
ball, but Saturday night Charles Glad-
man showed him why he must carry

for coverage of the Pirate game.

Then this man and his daughter sat
down on my other side. The little girl
would have been cute had she been
seen and not heard.

I'm sure that the other 16,000 plus
people there agreed with me. I per-
sonally do not need to know where
some little kid goes every ten
seconds. ‘

How about the ‘little boy who sat
directly in front of me? Or should I
say, stood up in front of me, glove
poised high in the air ready to snag
a fly ball.

The Pirates certainly made a lot of
money yesterday. They mustghave

but once again they've let down_ i_n
two critical situations this year —‘ they

Both drives came in the fourth?

The kicking has been very shaky_so

Pitt shuts out Slippery Rock

 9

The Pitt soccer team improved its
record to 2-0 with a 1-0 victory over
Slippery Rock.

The Panthers only goal of the game
was scored by Dan Liberati on a
direct kick, following a Slippery Rock
foul. The goal came with just over 19
minutes remaining in the game.

Slippery Rock challenged Pitt
goalie Mark Hendricks numerous
times, but the sophomore was able
to hold off their attack. En route to his
second consecutive shutout, Hen-
dricks recorded 10 saves.

Both teams played aggressively,
with players from each team being
given yellow cards for fouls.

Slippery Rock goalie Dan Camp-
bell also had a good game, shutting
down many of the Panthers offensive
attacks.

’’It wasn't a pretty game," said
coach Joe Luxbacher. ”But it was a
win. There are some areas we need
to work on. Things won't get any
easier for us.” ‘

There were some strong perform-
ances turned in by Pitt players, in-
cluding senior Kurt Weber and
freshman Brian Hammond.

”l was happy to see some of the
guys have strong games,” Luxbacher Marshall Clark/The Pl” News
said. ”lfwe can eliminate some of the - Jeff Vargas of Pitt and an unidentified California player

 that We mad?’ We WI” be battle for the ball in last week's game. On Saturday Pitt
etter shape. ,
stopped Slippery Rock, 1-0.

Stewart returns from injury

By Rick Fellinger

Sta ff Writer

Not too many people take
volleyball very seriously. Volleyball
seems like it's ranked somewhere
around smurfs on most students’ lists
of priorities. It's no wonder, because
it isn't too tough to imagine playing
the sport with a bunch of friends,
cooking a few hot dogs a few feet
away, maybe playing the radio and
using pitchers of beer to mark the
boundaries. There's no personal or
school pride involved in the way
most people play. There isn't much
weight put on winning or losing; in
fact, there might not even be
anybody keeping score. The biggest
problem is trying not to spill the
boundary markers.

Well, volleyball is a sport that is
seen in a different light by the Lady
Panther volleyball team, including
5-9 junior Lisa Stewart. Lisa has taken
the sport of volleyball seriously since
her sophomore year at Farrell High
School, where she initiated her car-
eer when a friend talked her into try-

ing out for the team. At Farrell, she
helped her team to a state champion-
ship in herjunior year and a runner-
up spot in the state finals in her senior
yeah

Last year, as a sophomore, Lisa was
voted the Lady Panthers’ team MVP
and humbly said she was honored
that her teammates felt she deserved
it. She emphasized that volleyball is
a team sport and requires a team ef-
fort. ”We’re like one big family on
and off the court.”

This past summer Lisa prepared for
the season with a little nostalgia. She
went home to Farrell where she
worked for the recreation department
and worked out with her alma
mater’s volleyball squad in the after-
noons. She also spent a short time at
a volleyball camp in Archibald,
Ohio, which she said was simply
”great.”

But this season got off to a tragic
start when Lisa began having terrible
chest pains which forced -her to the
sidelines. She missed the majority of
the team practices in August but
returned for the first three games Pitt

played in the Villanova Classic. Dur-
ing these games she couldn't escape
the physical or emotional effect of her
injury: ’’It bothered me a lot. I was
worried. It took away from my per-
formance because it was on my
mind.” Lisa hopes to be back on the
hardwoods as soon as possible.

In intercollegiate volleyball, the
schools from California traditionally
have a much more formidable
reputation than those from any other
area of the country, but this doesn't
intimidate Lisa at all. She admits that
a lot of the better teams do come out
of California, yet at the same time she
insists, ”They can be beaten. ’’It takes
a team like Pitt. lfthey relax on us just
one time, we'll just jump on them.”
This attitude corresponds with Lisa's
favorite quote, which she honestly
admits is cliche but swears by it
anyway: ”Anybody can be beaten on
any given day.”

Despite her injury, Lisa isn't
modest in her predictions for Pitt this
year. She said that she is looking for-
ward to a great season.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 15, 1986

Pitt downs CMU
in women's tennis

by Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

Consistency can be the key to a
successful season in sports. Coaches
swear by it, players harp on it, fans
demand it and teams are remem-
bered by it.

For example, who will ever forget
The Big Red Machine in baseball in
the '70s or the Pittsburgh Steelers
glory years in the late '70s.

The Panthers women's tennis team
is also a model of consistency. They
have consistently been inconsistent
since 1979. But, George Dieffenbach
took over as head coach in 1981 and
has been working to steady the Lady
Panthers. Since Dieffenbach has been
at the helm, Pitt has steadied into a
29-29 record.

In 1981, Pitt won only one match
going 1-9 but came back in 1982 to
go 8-2. The next year proved to be
another sub-.500 season, and the pro-
gram seemed to be headed for a
frustrating roller coaster ride of ups
and downs.

Then in 1984, Jodi Levine earned
MVP honors while leading the Lady
Panthers to a 9-5 record. And last

season Carrie DeVera was voted

MVP when Pitt went 7-6.

Dieffenbach believes this season
will be very important for the Lady
Panthers in that a successful season
will instill a winning attitude and put
an end to any doubts his players may
have about their potential.

”We really need a winning
season,” Dieffenbach said, ” but the
main thing that I look for is not
record, but the improvement in their
game and their performance on the
court. A winning season will come
if they stay with it long enough. If
they work hard enough and have the
right attitude, eventually they will
have a winning record.”

Levine, the only senior on the
squad, returns from a year off during
which she concentrated on her
studies. In 1984, Levine was an im-
pressive 9-2 in the No. 1 slot. Dief-
fenbach is pleased to have Levine
back and said she will be challeng-
ed by an impressive freshman for the
honor of playing in the No. 1 singles
slot.

The challenger is Tracy Feltingoff
from Emmaus High School in Allen-
town, Pa., Feltingoff compiled a 30-3
record while playing for Emmaus and
was the Pocono Mountain Junior
Champion, Lehigh Valley MSJA
finalist, Scranton MSJA finalist and
Northeastern Junior Open finalist.

”Tracy and Jodi should battle it out
for the No. 1 slot,” Dieffenbach said.
”They are both excellent players, and
it should be a good battle.”

DeVera will also be an upper-level
singles player for Pitt after going 9-4
last season. DeVera was the only
Lady Panther to win a match in the
Big East championships, in which Pitt
finished last for the fourth straight
season.

”Our team has never done really
well at the Big East championships,”
Dieffenbach said. ”That’s our goal
this year —- to do well there. We need
to develop confidence throughout
the season, produce a winning team
and record and carry it forward with
a lot of momentum into the Big East
championships [to] get out of last
place. There's only one way we can
go, and that is up.”

Three juniors and a sophomore
round out the young roster for Pitt.
Michelle Hobson, Bridgette Kyle and
Stephanie Nelson enter their junior
year and will be a strong nucleus for

the fourth, fifth and sixth singles slots
and will also strengthen Pitt's doubles
play.

Nelson earned an 8-5 record last
season in singles play; Kyle was 6-2
in doubles play; and Hobson was 3-3
in doubles competition.

Karen Meade, the only sophomore
on the team, is a strong-willed player
and improved consistently in 1985.

continued from page ll
in p§1alties, the lead would have
been bigger and the game definitely
out of reach.

Congemi, who threw for 225
yards, agrees. ”We missed so many
opportunities,” he said. ”So many
things that could have gone right
went wrong. There is no reason we
shouldn't have scored 28 points in

 4 » the first half.”

Still, Pitt appeared in good shape,
even after a third quarter, 24-yard
field goal by Wolfpack kicker Mark
Cofer. The Panthers, aided by a
40-yard run by Gladman, had the ball

first and 10 on N.C. State's 33, but
the penalty bug struck once again.

Pitt was called for a 15-yard per-
sonal foul and had to settle for a
53-yard field goal attempt by
freshman Jeff VanHorne, which fell

short. I
Punting from N.C. State 5 45-yard

line, Pitt freshman John Rasp shanked
his first kick of the night, giving the
Wolfpack good field position at their
own 30-yard line. That's when
Wolfpack senior quarterback Erik
Kramer came alive. Kramer, who left
the game momentarily with a nerve
problem in his elbow, completed a

28-yard pass on third down to
receiver Nasrallah Worthen and then
scampered down the right side for 20
yards, putting the ’Pack at Pitt's 23.
Kramer completed another pass to
Worthen for 16 yards and after two
incompletions found receiver
Haywood leffires in the corner of the
end zone for a touchdown. N.C. State
went for a two-point conversion and,
when Kramer hit Worthen cutting
across the middle of the end zone,
the Wolfpack was within three points
of a tie.

Pitt took the kickoff and tried to run
out the clock. But the Panthers stalled

and were forced to punt from their
35. With under two minutes left in
the game, it appeared the pressure
would fall on Pitt's defense. It certain-
ly did, but not under the cir-
cumstances the Panthers expected.

Facing a 10-man rush, Rasp fum-
bled the snap from center. He quickly
fell on the ball, but N.C. State had
possession at Pitt's 16-yard line. After
the game, a somber Rasp said, ’’I
don't know what happened.”

The Panthers were aided by a 15-
yard offensive interference call
against the Wolfpack, but that didn't
deter Cofer, who came on the field

for a 49-yard field goal attempt with
one minute left. The snap, hold and
kick were true, tying the game and
sending the crowd into a wild frenzy.

Pitt still had one more chance, and
Congemi drove the Panthers down
the field, completing passes to Glad-
man, Darrin Gillaspie and Reggie
Williams. And when VanHorne lined
up for a 50-yard field goal attempt it
appeared Pitt might pull it out. But

' it wasn't to be, as VanHorne’s kick

went wide left, giving the ’Pack a
moral win and sending the Panthers
home dejected, searching for many
answers. Answers to why they con-
tinue to lose football games they
should win. And why they continue
to lose to teams they outplay, even
under a new coaching staff, which
many believed had erased from the
players minds the memories of 1984
and 1985's fourth-quarter disasters.

’’I’m the leader of the team,” said
Congemi. ”So if we don't win, it’s a
reflection on me, but I don't know
what else to do.”

floats, one from each class, then the
West Lafayette Marching Band,
followed at last by a flotilla of con-
vertibles, each carrying a Homecom-
ing queen contestant. It took about
a half hour for all the cars to get on
the field. I mean it. There were pro-
bably 20 cars on the field. It was
weird because from where I sat, all
the contestants looked alike. They
were all pretty enough, but they all
looked alike.

So anyway, the Public Address an-
nouncer gave a brief biography of
each girl. They were about halfway
through the lineup when this kid
behind me turns to his friend.

”l’ll bet Kathy wins this,” he said.
His friend didn't answer for a while
but said finally, ”What makes you
think so?”

”She’s the best looking,'’ he said.
‘Besides, I just have a feeling.”

”Who do I pick?” the friend asked.

"Anybody,” he said. ”l’ll tell you
what — I'll give you anybody else.
If Kathy ‘wins, I win the bet. If
anybody else wins, you got it."

”Anybody?”

”Yeah, anybody other than Kathy,
you win. We'll go for $20.”

”You’re on.”

I'm thinking two things right now.
One, I didn't know there were this
many convertibles in Indiana, and

two, there are really guillible people

in this school. .

So they get done introducing
everybody and announce the results.
A drum roll, please. The PA crackles

on and the winner is Kathy

McDonald!

”That was pretty good,” I said.
”How’d you know she was gonnna
win, she your girlfriend or what?"

”Wel|,” he said sheepishly, ’’I’m in
the Key Club, and I counted the votes

today at lunch.’’ '
