BLOCK plan lo undergo changes

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Some students lost money on
the BLOCK meal plan, but others,
like junior Solomon Childs, ate
for free last semester because of it.

Childs’ fraternity brothers treat-
ed him to meals at The Pitt Club
and other locations on campus as
they tried to get rid of blocks that
wouldn’t transfer into the next

semester.

But many students didn’t have
enough friends to feed or just
couldn’t eat enough over the
course of the semester to use up
their blocks. They lost money, and
so did Pitt

"This plan did not work,” said
the director of Food Services yes-
terday to Student Government
Board members and representa-
tives from other governance

groups. Betsy Sallade-Farina par-
ticipated in a president’s council
which allowed board members to
ask questions about the history
and future of the meal plan.

“The initial beauty of the
BLOCK plan is that it empow-
ered students, much like a check-
ing account, to have control of
their meals,” Sallade-Farina said.

The BLOCK plan gave stu-
dents more ﬂexibility than the old

Dean's resignation leaves questions

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

On Friday, Jan. 6, Davis
Bobrow, dean of the Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs, was forced
to resign by Pitt Provost James
Maher. ‘

The decision met with anger
within the school. Maher stated
in his letter to Bobrow, “I have
lost confidence in you as a
dean.”

Students, faculty and staff
attended an open meeting with
Maher yesterday, eager to find
out just what caused him to lose

faith in Bobrow.

Maher opened the meeting by
stating he would not discuss
personnel issues, leaving some
students angry and still wonder-
ing why Bobrow was fired.

In 1988, GSPIA was on the
ropes. According to Barbara
Porter, one of the assistant
deans in GSPIA, its academic
standing plummeted, and it was
strapped for money. In no
uncertain terms, the school was
in a disarray.

On July 1, 1988, Bobrow was
brought on as GSPIA’s dean and
slowly but surely began to res-
urrect the school, according to

Porter.

Under Bobrow, money began
ﬂowing in as a result of his
recruiting and networking abili-
ties, and the school’s programs
were accredited, Porter said.

According to statistics provid-
ed by GSPIA, between 1988
and 1994 the grade point aver-
age of incoming students
increased 6 percent while the
rejection rate of applying stu-
dents increased l0 percent.

The caliber of faculty has
improved, according to GSPIA’s
Student Cabinet. One faculty
member recently turned down a

°GSPIA, page 4

14- or l9—meal-a-week plans,
Sallade-Farina said. But that
required more responsibility from
students, who under the BLOCK
system had to pace themselves to
avoid ending up with a pile of
blocks at the end of the term.

But after the failure of the

3’ BLOCK system, the simplicity of

a meal—per-week plan has become
attractive to some students.

meeting

For The Pitt News

There was not an empty seat
at last night’s Student
Government Board meeting.

_ For the first time this semester,

students came and voiced their
opinions and/or complaints to
the Board. As a result, the

meeting lasted nearly an hour,

making it the longest of the
year
“I was very satisfied with

I the attendance for the meeting,
and I encourage all students to ‘

come,” said SGB President
Julie Crowell. _

“It was good to see so many
concerned students represent
their interests,” SGB member
John Callahan stated.

‘In all, there was roughly 25
people in attendance, repre-
senting groups such as Black
Action Society and the School
of Engineering. There were
also those who were not affili-
ated with any particular stu-
dentgroup, but referred to
themselves as “concemed stu-
dents.”

Many in the audience had
comments and questions for
the Board. One student pre-
sented a list of problems, par-
ticularly those on-campus.
Another student voiced his
disapproval in regards to the
lack of lighting near Forbes
Hall and Meyran. ,

There was also a discussion
that focused on BAS and its
proposal for a Steel Pan
Program that was denied by
the Allocations Committee.
Members of BAS inquired as
to why they could not use the
$1,000 that was left from the
Sister Souljah concert to fund
the proposed Steel Pan
Program.

“I think the Allocations
Committee is trying to prove a
point,” said BAS member

Wolmark elected as

new NSABP choir

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

A new chair has been
elected for the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel Project just 10
months after Dr. Bernard
Fisher was forced to resign
from the position over
reports of research fraud.

The University of
Pittsburgh and Allegheny
Health, Education and
Research Foundation
announced last week that
they will cooperate on the
management of the NSABP,
headquartered at Pitt.

With this agreement, Dr.
Norman Wolmark will serve
as chair and principal inves-
tigator of the Operations
Office. Wolmark is director
of the division of surgical
oncology and directorof the
Allegheny Cancer Center at
Allegheny General Hospital
in Pittsburgh.

Dr. Ronald Herberman,
NSABP interim chair and
director of the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute, will serve
as the principal investigator
of the Biostatistical Center.

“This agreement is an
important milestone in the
revitalization of the NSABP
so that it can optimally con-
tinue its very important
research to improve the
treatment and prevention of
breast and bowel cancers,”
said Herberman.

Wolmark added,
“Everyone involved is
pleased with a resolution
that will enable us to move
forward.” -

The Operations Office will
control the development of
clinical protocols and coor-
dination of their implemen-

tation. This office will also.

be in charge of training per-
sonnel, prioritizing research
efforts, overseeing principal
investigators at the NSABP
sites and reporting on the

Wolmark will also develop
a budget for the NSABP,
prepare scientific reports
and coordinate special stud-
ies as director of the
Operations Office.

As chair, he will appoint
members to the NSABP
Executive Committee, as
well as establish scientific
and research priorities.

The Biostatistical Center
will be in charge of collect-
ing and managing all data
which comes into the
NSABP, establishing quality
assurance measures, study-
ing monitoring procedures,
being responsible for all on-
site auditing and analyzing
the results of the clinical
treatment and prevention
studies.

The center is to notify
Wolmark of any serious data
irregularities.

“Doctors. Herberman and
Wolmark are both brilliant
and compassionate clinical
researchers. They meet the
exceedingly high standards
of administrative excellence
needed for the modern
NSABP,” said Dr. Samuel
Broder, director of the
National Cancer Institute.
“Their leadership of NSABP

will help bring the nation '

closer to prevention and

‘cures of breast cancer and

other forms of cancer and
related diseases.”

Pitt students study at area schools

By Stephanie Wright
StaffWriter
Allegheny County is

home to 10 accredited col-
leges, and Pitt students have
access to enroll at all of
them.

The Pittsburgh Council on
Higher Education is the
organizing force behind the
cross registration.

All full—time undergradu-
ate and graduate students
have the opportunity to take
one course a semester at any
of the council’s other 10
member institutions.

For example, Carlow
College has a strong anato-
my and physiology course
that Pitt does not offer every
term. Carnegie Mellon
University offers a Navy
Reserve Officer Training
Corps course that is not part
of Pitt’s ROTC curriculum.

When. Pitt’s schedule
lacks a course which is
needed to fulfill a require-
ment, or if one of the other
institutions offers a course
that that would make an
interesting elective, then
cross registration enables
the students to take advan-
tage of those classes.

However‘, according to
Fred Koloc, director of
Pitt’s College of Arts and
Sciences Advising Center,
in the past few years, not
very many undergraduate
students have used this
scheduling alternative.

“I would be really sur-

prised to find out contradic-
tory information,” said
Koloc, referring to his low
estimate of the number of
students who cross register.

According to Linda Burns,
an assistant dean, Koloc’s
estimation was accurate.

In the Fall term of 1993,
only 40 undergraduate stu-
dents cross registered with
the surrounding campuses.
In the Spring of 1994, only
38 undergraduates used
cross registration. Most stu-
dents attended CMU.

As for why students don’t
cross register, Koloc specu-
lated that it’s a matter of
publicity. .

“I don’t think it’s purpose-
ly hidden [from the stu-
dents],” said Koloc. “In the
rush of everyday life, stu-
dents don’t stop to realize
that they can do it.”

“I’m surprised that more

students don’t take advan— '

tage of this,” said Burns.
"Burns said she would
encourage cross registration
if only to gain a different
perspective.
“I would encourage stu-

dents to cross register if _‘

they want to sample courses
in a department that has a
different emphasis than
ours,” said Burns. “For
example, Duquesne’s ‘Social
Science and Psychology
departments have a very dif-
ferent emphasis on [this
type of curriculum.]”

Koloc said lithe‘ ‘actual

process of cross registration

is very simple. The advising
department makes all the
contacts in reference to class

openings at the other institu- .

tions, and there is no need
for Pitt students to apply to
or visit the other campuses
to register.

The research into the
courses offered is the stu-
dent’s responsibility. Koloc
said the advising department
does have some schedules
for the other institutions, but
it’s a matter of chance.

Duquesne and CMU will
send their schedules to stu-
dents free of charge.
However, CMU does charge
$4 for their booklet of
course descriptions.

Other participating
schools include Chatham
College, La Roche College,
Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary, Point Park
College and Robert Morris

‘College.

There are some basic reg-
ulations to ensure that stu-
dents at the home institution
get their choice of classes
first.

Pitt will not accept stu-
dents from other institutions
until after the scheduling
add/drop period. This fol-
lows with Pittsburgh
Council on

Higher

Education policy that the:

home students have first pri-
ority of classes.

In the Fall term of .1993,
173 students cross registered

“You have enough to worry
about without having to count
your food,” Childs said.

Pitt’s meal plan will further
evolve in that direction, as
Sallade-Farina announced that
Food Services will look at chang-
ing the meal plan back to a meal-
per-week concept.

Sallade-Farina announced at the
president’s council a proposal that
would give students the choice of
a three, ﬁve or seven meals per
week plan.

These meals would be supple-
mented by Marriott Dollars,
which would work on a dollar for
dollar basis, similar to the way
Choice Dollars operates. But
while Choice Dollars extends to a
few businesses in Oakland, like
Miami Subs, Marriott Dollars will
not

A student who chooses the
tl1ree—meal-per-week plan would
lose any meals not used by the
end of the week, but would have
an amount of Marriott Dollars to
dispense as he/she chooses.
Overall, the meals-per-week plus
the Marriott Dollars would rough-
ly match the price of a 210-
BLOCK plan, but details such as
this haven’t been ﬁnalized, said
the general manager of Marriott
Operations, Jim Jenkis.

This plan should make stu-
dents’ lives easier. They would
not face the insurmountable chal-
lenge that a 210-BLOCK plan
presented to some. They would

simply need to track their meals
for the week, Sallade-Farina said.

And it would help Marriott to
manage its food operations better.
The company could base staffing
decisions upon a consistent ﬂow
of customers. Under the BLOCK
system, it was diﬂicult to predict
how much staff it would need
because student frequency varied
so much.

Sallade-Farina said this plan
will take effect next fall. The
details of the plan haven’t been
ironed out yet, but should form
more solidly by next week.

Many students favor such a
plan.

“I think it’s a good idea,” said
sophomore Bill Foight “I thought
it was kind of ridiculous how
you're left with all the blocks at
the end of the semester.”

Junior Renee Delemarre said
she hates the BLOCK plan
because she’s constantly con-
cerned with getting her money’s
worth for her blocks. She said she
would favor the meal-a-week plan
above the BLOCK plan.

The BLOCK plan failed for
numerous reasons, Sallade-Farina
said. It required ﬁrst year on-cam-
pus students to buy 250/280
blocks per semester at $800 to
$900 per term. Students paid
about $3.36 per block.

“Students not only had an own-
ership of blocks, but they also had
a feeling that they had to use all
the blocks,” Sallade-Farina said

So when students began dump-

ing their blocks at the residence
hall convenience stores, Pitt was
still paying to staff and to put out
food for the cafeterias, Schenley
Cafe and Eddie’s. Before
Thanksgiving, about 1,500 stu-
dents visited the convenience
stores a day, making transactions
of an average of 10 blocks at a
time, Sallade-Farina said.

Then for students who wanted
to purchase one or two items at
the convenience stores, the long
lines became a frustration. So
those who used the BLOCK plan
responsibly were affected by other
students’ dumping.

By Thanksgiving, Food
Services faced a ﬁnancial crisis,
Sallade-Farina said. Over 10 per-
cent of students had not used over
60 percent of their meal plan.

Ben Tuchi, senior vice chancel-
lor for business and ﬁnance, had
encouraged Food Services and
Marriott to come up with a cre-
ative meal plan alternative to the
14- or l9-meal—a-week plan, thus
resulting in the BLOCK plan. But
Pitt suffered from its innovation.

“We recognized before
Thanksgiving that it wasn’t the
smartest thing in the world to do,”
he said at the council. .

'I‘uchi had mandated that Food
Services should not proﬁt from
the meal plan, nor should it lose
money. Food Services does not
receive tuition money, Sallade-
Farina said

professorship at Yale University
while another turned down a
chair at the University of
Pennsylvania.

Under Bobrow’s tenure, the
school is now standing on the
firmest legs it has been on in
quite some time, Porter said.

Students, faculty and staff are
worried, however, that it won’t
stand on firm legs very long.

Members of the GSPIA
Student Cabinet expressed con-
cern over the manner in which
Bobrow was ﬁred, worried that
it would cripple GSPIA’s ability
to recruit another dean as well
as other students for next year.

“Bobrow was a very respect-
ed man, considered to be num-
ber one in his field of study,”
Victoria Stanley, a GSPIA ‘stu-
dent, said. “After he has been
ﬁred, it is difﬁcult to find some-
one who can be expected to do
everything he has done for the
school.”

Although most students and
faculty agree it has been a pow-
erful blow to the school, Maher
stands behind his decision and
reassured students the school
would be ﬁne.

“Firing Bobrow was a neces-
sary personnel action and not
an attack on the school,” said
Maher.

“If the faculty can pull
together and sell the school and
show what GSPIA is and that it

will do well, it will have a good
dean.”

Some students however were
not satisfied with what Maher
had to say.

“I did not feel we were given
information on what GSPIA’s
future will be,” Chris O’Bergin,
a GSPIA student, said.

GSPIA Student Cabinet
members were upset. They
were disappointed in the length
of Maher’s speech and also
with his apparent misinforma-
tion of the school and its poten-
tial.

Maher said GSPIA is not
considered in the top five
growth areas at Pitt, but GSPIA
has been ranked 10th in its ﬁeld
nationally.

GSPIA student Nitin
Badjatria said, “[Pitt] Schools
should be prioritized on the
basis of their rank in their
respective ﬁelds.”

There was also some concern
expressed by the GSPIA
Student Cabinet on pressure
that faces the faculty and stu-
dents because of Maher’s
actions.

“It is not a perceived prob-
lem, it’s a real problem,” said
GSPIA Student Cabinet
President Myron Dowell.
“Since the burden has been
placed on faculty and students,
our work has been cut out for
us because our future depends
on it.”

that is that BAS programs cost

Davidson said that money left

past projects, as well as
upcoming events.

Yesterday afternoon, mem-
bers of SGB took part in the
president’s council meeting,
which focused on the current
food service and meal plan
system.

Crowell said it’s easier to
understand why some students
had problems with the blocks.
“Maybe you can chalk that up
to having an unexpected situa-

tion arise from such a radically
different program,” Crowell
said.

President’s council meetings
will be held around the first or
second week of every month.

Also discussed was the SGB
Summit held at Point Park
College last Wednesday. In
addition to Pitt, other schools
that attended were Carnegie-
Mellon, Chatham, Carlow,
LaRoche and Duquesne.

During this summit, all of
the schools got together and
discussed certain agendas. The
topics focused on last
Wednesday were alcohol
abuse and the student ridership
plan in association with Port
Authority Transit.

“It’s wonderful. I’m really
glad we started to do this. Just
the input you can receive from
the other organizations can
only strengthen your own,”
Crowell stated.

Blocks

0From page 4
the amount of blocks that students
could use at the convenience
stores to one at a time, then
changed the limit to two after
meeting with SGB members.

While students complained that
these changes were sudden and
poorly publicized, Sallade-Farina
says Pitt made many efforts to
accommodate students. Pitt dedi-
cated several days to allowing stu-
dents to change their meal plan,
either to lower their BLOCK
amount or to transfer blocks into
Choice Dollars.

And Food Services threw a
BLOCK party at Eddie’s.
Students could unload their
blocks by purchasing bulk
amounts of food. The prices in
many cases exceeded prices in
stores, but Pitt did. not make any"
money from the event.

“If the BLOCK party hadn’t
taken place, there’d have been a
proﬁt,” T uchi said. Pitt could have

allowed the semester to close
without helping students to
unload their blocks, Sallade-
Farina said.

Sophomore Scott Boden ended
the semester with 80 blocks, but
said students shouldn’t blame the
university. He knew how many
blocks he would have to con-
sume, and it was his responsibility
to consume that amount.
However, Pitt could have done a
better job explaining the meal
plan to students, Boden said.

“I think the BLOCK system is
a good idea as an idea,” he said.
“The problem was they didn’t
infonn you enough.”

But Food Services sent pam-
phlets explaining the new meal
plan to students and even dissemi-
nated information during summer
orientation sessions.

Freshman Konstantin Melamud

’ is struggling to use up his blocks

on pace. The outline published by
Food Services says he should

have 160 blocks left, but
Melamud has 180. He has treated
his friends at Eddie’s and at
Schenley Cafe, paying for their
food with his blocks.

“I feed all my friends,” he said
But Melamud said he wonders
whether the new plan would clean
up this problem. He would pay
the same amount of money for a
meal plan, and while he probably
won’t have a problem using up
the meals, he might have trouble
using up the Maniott Dollars.

“I think it’s the same thing,” he 0

said. “It’s just different words.”

Some students said they don’t
understand why the plan has to
ﬂuctuate so much.

“I never really understood the
problems they had my freshman
year [with the 14- or 19-p1an],”
Childs said.

“We’ve been changing our
meal plan every year, and it’s get-
ting a little ridiculous and confus-
ing for some students.”

Register

from CMU. In the Spring term
of 1994, 197 students cross

from CMU.

Koloc warned that there are
some obstacles to consider
when cross registering. First is
transportation. Pitt shuttles do
run to CMU, and Carlow is
within walking distance, but
the other campuses require

The other obstacle is that
not all institutions’ calendars
coincide with Pitt’s.
Scheduled events like holiday

Koloc said that it should be

cross registration that Pitt’s
final exam week may fall
prior to the exam week of the
host university. This could
leave students in Pittsburgh
for one extra week.

Under council regulations,
the rules of the host institution
prevail.

“Students shouldn’t expect
that they can negotiate the
[host university’s] calendar

just because their home uni-
versity is Pitt,” said Koloc.

There is one standing rule of
the council that can be negoti-
ated with special permission
from the Dean’s office.
Typically, Pitt students cannot
cross register for a course that
Pitt offers.

According to Burns, excep-
tions are very rare, but some
do exist. For instance, if a stu-

dent needs a course to gradu-
ate or to enter graduate school,
and it is not offered at Pitt
before their prospective grad-
uation.date, then approval will
probably be given for cross
registration.

Koloc said students should
not be afraid to negotiate cross
registration with their advisbr
or seek special permission
from their dean.

Crime is an increasing problem in the nation, and the
Republicans have promised us more prisons to warehouse the
criminals that are caught. Yet, the answer to the crime prob-
lems are not merely stashing people in human stock yards
which become schools for turning people into hardened and
more dangerous criminals. It is even less effective to incar-
cerate small-time criminals who occupy space which could be
used to keep violent offenders away from society.

The University of Massachusetts has set up a program to-

help reform criminals. The students study literature in a
closely monitored program. According to Parade Magazine,

the students spend 12 weeks reading stories of increasing \

complexity. They explore the meaning of the stories in two-
hour discussions. The participants live at home and are on
probation. Missing classes or skipping the readings can be a
cause for their return to prison. *

They must also attend a one-day career workshop and
remain on probation after graduation from the program. This
is in conjunction with the participants making concrete plans
for the future, such as returning to school. So, it is not just a
feel-good, self-esteem building form of alternative punish-
ment.

A professor of English at the University of Massachusetts
volunteered to lead the program. Studies conducted both by
the University of Massachusetts and by Indiana University
show that the recidivism rate of these offenders is much
lower than those who are dealt with in the conventional man-
ner. g

While study groups and other alternative forms of punish-
ments are not suitable for all criminals, this country must
begin dealing with the different kinds of crimes in appropri-
ate ways. -

Talk about increasing police officers and prisons will lead
to one half of the country trying to arrest and imprison the
other half. The United States already has the largest prison
population of all the countries in the first world. If we do not
seek .to,_,change.,the_.w_ay. we deal with crime and punishment in
this country, this trend will not change. I V‘ '  I 7‘ ‘

It is clear that the currentmethods of dealingtwlith crime do
not work. Perhaps it is time to try something different. It is
better to have people reading than to subject’ criminals to
floggings or other barbaric acts as some countriesare fond of
doing. ,

The criminal justice system as ‘a whole should look into this
program as a possible alternative to prison sentencing. The

. University of Pittsburgh may be able to work in conjunction

with law enforcement and corrections officers to develop a
program of a similar nature. Universities have a responsibility
to educate people and also to serve the community of which
they are a -part. Combining these missions in this way is one
way for the university to give the best of what it has to offer.

Cyber-lemmings begin their run

As hard as it may be to

— believe, there are still some peo-

ple out there who insist upon
being intimidated by computers.
This is a bad idea. Within two
decades, it will be absolutely,
completely, unquestionably
impossible’ to avoid dealing with
computers on a daily basis,

unless of coursegyou decide to__
, go live like Thoreau by Schenley --
‘ Pond. I ’ ' ‘ ' '

Naturally, the computers of 20
years hence will be quite a bit
different from those of today.
They’ll be 10 feet tall, with big,
sharp teeth and claws that can
rip out your — no, just kidding.
What they will be, however, is
integrated.

What this means, for those of
you who never took Classics
101011, “Latin for Computer

Geeks,” is that you will have one ‘V
single device that combines the

functions of telephone, televi-
sion, personal computer and fax
machine; Maybe it will be called
a “netlink” or “teleportal” or
“Eugene,” but whatever its
name, it will be found in every
household in America, and a
good portion of those around the
world.

Probably, your amazed, fasci-
nated response to this shining
prophecy is, “So what? So when
I’m 40 I'll be able to watch
Baywatch: The Next Generation
on the same screen I use to talk
to my boss in Guam —— big deal!
That doesn’t help me now, when
I can’t get the printer in David
Lawrence to double-space my
psych paper on behavioral modi-
fication in lemmings!”

To which my response is:
Relax. Take a deep breath. Wax
on, wax off. The computer isn’t
alive; it’s just an inanimate hunk
of metal and plastic, not a
malevolent demon from hell. It
isn’t out to get you, and —— even
though this is Pitt, where the
motto is “I Don’t Need No Brain
Ifl Got My Football” — you’re
almost certainly smarter than it

Step one in conquering the

cyber—world is using e-mail. E-
mail is a form of communication
which is powerful, efficient, aes-
thetically pleasing and ultimately
addictive; it’s no coincidence
that “e-mail” rhymes with
“female.” What’s more, e-mail is
really quite easy to use. Here’s a

Dear Professor: I ’m sorry,
but I will not be ableto hand in

many fascinating pieces of infor-

See? Easy! That’s all there is
to it. Once you can do this, you
can write similar messages to
people all over the planet,
although most of them probably
won’t care much about your
lame excuses.

After you’ve mastered e-mail,
the next step is the newsgroups,
also called bulletin boards or
“BBS,” not to be confused with
the pellet-gun projectiles.
Newsgroups are like long lists of
publicly posted e-mail about one
topic. This lets lots of people
who have never heard of each
other hold discussions about
something that interests them all,
like politics, sex, deep-sea fish-
ing or sex.

Newsgroups have names that
describe them by subject. For
example, a newsgroup for peo-
“ple in the Pittsburgh arch who
like to make mittens might be
called pgh.hobbies.knitting.
Sometimes, the name of the a
newsgroup is more entertaining

than the actual messages in it,

such as —— and I swear this one
really does exist
alt.sex.bondage.particle.physics.
These news boards are almost
as simple to use as e-mail is. For
example, here’s a message ybu
might post on a newsgroupiin
your field of interest: '

extra four days to try to write 10

even going to dock my grade!
Life is great! By the way, does
anyone here know anything

Of course, what you have to
remember when posting mes-

one in the world could be read-

your newsgroup post could be
followed by an e-mail message

No. 4 UConn pounds Pcrnters, O-61

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

The route changed, but the destination

remained the same.

Pitt lost to UConn last night, but

Mwww
// .

unlike other losses this draining season,    

this one was a blowout. Pitt got out-
played and dominated throughout the
game, as the No. 4 UConn Huskies

crushed the Panthers, 90-61.

The Panthers didn’t blow any leads,
didn’t come from -behind only to lose at
the end. Instead, they got outplayed the
entire game for the first time this year

in Big East play.

“We were just on a total emotional
empty,” said head coach Ralph Willard.
With the loss, Pitt dropped to 1-11 in
the Big Eas-t and 5-15» overall. The
Panthers now have nine days to rest
before battling Boston College. Last
night, UConn was anything but resting.
“They just physically manhandled
us,” Willard said. “Jim Calhoun,
[UConn’s head coach] just kept going to
his bench. They always had fresh legs.”
UConn was paced by sophomore Ray
Allen, who scored 24 points. He con-
nected on five three-pointers to lead the
Huskies, who were 10-for-19 on three-
point attempts. It wasn’t only Allen who

destroyed Pitt.

The Panthers did a good job of beat-
ing themselves, as they committed 24 _
turnovers. Point guard Andre Alridge
was a non-factor in the game, he had  .
four fouls in the first half and fouled out - %
with just under five minutes left. I
Alridgerexited with four points.

UConn's star swingman Ray Allen tallied24 points last night.

Majors signs highly. touted football recruits

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer

Just as in each of his past two
years, Pitt football head coach
Johnny Majors claims this
year’s recruiting class will
improve the Panther football
team.

“This year, we’ve got a better
group than last year,” Majors
said at his press conference last
Wednesday, the National Letter-
of—Intent signing day. “I am
encouraged by the recruiting at
this point.”

However, in contrast to other
years, this year national recruit-
ing experts are saying that
Majors’ assessment is an under-
statement.

Rick Kimbrel of Blue Chip
recrui'ting.magazine ranked
Pitt’s class third in the Big East,
behind only Miami and
Syracuse. Allen Wallace of
Super Prep magazine ranked
Pitt in the top four in the Big
East, while the Prep Football
Report’s Tom Lemming rated
Pitt as a Top 20 recruiting class.

But Majors refused to make
any predictions.

“Time will tell, but I think it’s
been a good year and a solid
year,” he said. “I think the guys
we’ve recruited will fit in very
well athletic-wise and leader-
ship-wise with this team.”

One reason Majors may have
contained his enthusiasm was
the fact only 15 of the 23 oral-

intent with the University of Pittsburgh:

committed recruits had signed
when Majors made his state-
ment. At press time on Monday,
however, 21 of the recruits were
signed. Another source of con-

cern was the fact eight recruits
must still meet academic testing
requirements for ﬁrst-year eligi-
bility.

“I anticipate all of our recruits

qualifying,” Majors said. “I
don’t think [any school] has 100
percent qualified at this point.
We’re recruiting people who I
strongly believe will graduate
the University of Pittsburgh, or

_we wouldn’t bring them in

here.”

One dimension of this year’s
recruiting effort which was
most promising, -according to
Majors, was the improvement
in local recruiting. This year’s
class includes nine
Pennsylvania recruits, six of
whom are from Western

 

 Pennsylvania. Last year at this

time, Pitt had six Pennsylvania
recruits, three of whom were
from Western Pennsylvania.

Quarterback Darnell Dinkins,
from nearby Schenley High
School, is one of Pitt’s highest
regarded recruits. Selected as
the City League Player of the
Year, Dinkins chose Pitt over
Notre Dame and Clemson. In
addition to passing for 1,127
yards his senior year, he dis-
played his versatility by rushing
for 422 yards en route to a City
League Championship.

Majors, who promised to go

hunting for offensive linemen in i

the offseason to replace Reuben
Brown and Lawson Mollica, is
giving a chance to another local
recruit —— Bill Craver of Penn
Hills. Craver, a 6-foot-3, 300-
pound All-State offensive line-
man, benches 460 pounds.

No. 19 Pitt wrestling crushes competition at duals

By Matt Hartung
For The Pitt News

The Panther wrestling team
kept on rolling as it demol-
ished all three opponents at
the Franklin and Marshall
duals Saturday night,
improving its record to 12-7
(2-1 in the Eastern Wrestling
League) and raising its
national ranking to No. 19.

“We had a pretty good
weekend,” Pitt head coach

Rande Stottlemyre said of-

the sweep.

The Pitt women’s gymnas-
tics team stepped out of its
league this past weekend
and traveled to. the
University of Missouri to
compete in the Cat Classic.

Winning the team compe-
tition was Penn State with a
score of 191.275. The
University of Arizona
(l91.l25), Missouri
(189.80), University of
Kentucky (l89.425), Auburn
University (188.20) and Pitt
(180.625) filled in the spots
behind the Lady Lions.

“It was a little disappoint-
ing,” Pitt head coach Debbie
Yohman said. “The competi-
tion was way above every-
body on our team.”

In the all-around competi— 1

tion, Kentucky's Jenny
Hansen (39.30), two-time
defending national champi-
on, took top honors. In sec-
ond place was Nicole
Garrett of.Arizona (38.5). In

third was Auburn’s Heather

Brown with a score of
38.45.’ Pitt’s highest all-
around score was Robyn
Senior’s 36.275.

 Men's gymnastics  
finishes in third

By Brad Isles
F or The Pig News

The Pitt men’s gymnastics
team traveled to the
Shenandoah Invitational,
held at James Madison
University, last Saturday.
And like the meet at Navy
two weeks ago, the pommel
horse was the key to the
Panthers finishing third.
They ended with an overall
score of 214.4, their best of
the season so far.

“We had a couple of
major breaks [on pommels]
that maybe cost us first,”
said junior Jason Lannie.

Junior Keith Youndt took
first with Pitt’s highest score
of the day, a 9.55, and senior
Jon Shapiro took seventh
with an 8.6, but that was not
enough. -The team ended up
with a 32.75, its lowest
score out of the six events.

“Basically, there were
breaks on pommels which
dropped us,” said head
coach Frank D’Amico. “But
I can’t find anything to com-
plain about. I don’t fault
them.”

. Finishing ahead of Pitt
when the final results were

posted was Navy with a
score of 217.2 and William
and Mary at 215.1. James
Madison (211.7) and
Radford (190.7) finished
fourth and fifth respectively.

This meet marked the first
time that all six juniors com-
peted at the same meet, due
to various injuries the last
two seasons.

“The team is maturing,
each week we’re getting a
little better,” said D’Amico.
“The guys were really psy-
ched up [for the meet].”

The floor exercise was
Pitt’s top event. The
Panthers edged out Navy for
first, 37.1 to 37.0. Junior
Brian Narvaez finished
eighth with an 8.45 to pace
the Panthers. I

“Floor e_xercise we did
great, and we were consis-
tent on everything else,”
said Lannie. “We know
what we have to work on
and maintain.”

Lannie led the way in the
all-around for Pitt, finishing
second with a score of 53.0.
He also placed ﬁfth on par-
allel bars with a 9.35.

Youndt ﬁnished fourth on

Hoops

°From page 8

Guard Jason Maile picked
up the slack in Alridge’s
absence, scoring 16 points, a
team-high along with Jaime
Peterson. But it was..not
enough.

The big four players for
UConn shredded through Pitt
the entire game. Allen,
Doron Scheffer, Donny
Marshall and Brian Fair
combined for 67 points.

Marshall had 15 points,
coming off monster slams
that sparked the.Huskies two
biggest runs of the game.

With just over 11 minutes
gone in the first half,
Marshall took a deep pass
from Scheffer and scored
right over the outstretched
arms of Orlando Antigua.
That built the Huskie lead to
33-16, their biggest of the
half.

Pitt went on a 10-2 run to
close the half down 13, 48-
35. But another dunk from
Marshall set off the Huskies.

Antigua scored the first
bucket of the second half,
but UConn went on to score
14 unanswered points, lead-
ing off with a Marshall slam
that was very similar to his
first one.

The rest of the half was all
UConn. At onepoint the
Huskies had outscored the
Panthers by a score of 31-5.
The Panthers were slowed

because of the handicap at
point guard. Alridge was
playing the entire second
half with four fouls and it
showed with his tentative
play. ‘

“We can’t take him out,”
Willard said. “We don’t have
any kind of backup that can
handle UConn’s pressure.”

UConn possessed a 90-48
lead with under four minutes
left in the game, but 10
points from Peterson and
Chris Gant and a three-point-
er from Garrick Thomas
ended the disaster. The 13-
point run saved the Panthers
from their worst loss of the
season.

The Panthers’ number
of losses to Top 20 teams
rose to nine with the loss. It
also was their fifth loss in a
row.

The Panthers have the next
week and two days off, and
Willard said he is happy
about that.

“We need a break,” he
said. “We’re going to prac-

tice one day and rest the ~

next.”

Willard said he wanted the
team to get the UConn loss
out of their minds.

“I told the guys that you
can’t do anything about this
game,” Willard said. “It was
just one of those nights. All
the emotion finally caught up
to us. "

Recruits
°From page 8

Even though Majors said he
made a point to try to strength-
en certain areas of the team, he
said the recruiting was not lim-
ited to certain positions.

“Right now we’re basically
recruiting at every position,”
Majors said. “Once you get a
program built, than you can fill
in more effectively.”

Continuing, Majors said he
hopes the recruits will especial-
ly add strength and speed to the
Pitt defense.

“We’ve recruited 12 players
we believe are defense-orient-
ed,” Majors said.

Looking to shore up the Pitt

linebacking corps is another
‘Pennsylvania recruit, Ken

Kashubara of New Castle.
Kashubara, at 6-4 , 225, runs a
4.7 40-yard dash and signed
with the Panthers on
Wednesday. Pitt also has a com-
mitment from Phil Clarke, a

linebacker from Miami, who
was courted by, the likes of
Notre Dame and Oklahoma.

One of Pitt’s most highly
regarded recruits is junior col-
lege transfer Maurice Harris of
Kansas, who is expected to
immediately make an impact on
the defensive line.

Another probable defensive
player from Pennsylvania is
Ethan Weidle, a two-time All-
Stater from Lebanon, who
spurned offers from Penn State
and Miami to come to Pitt.
Justin Wade, of South Park, is
another Pennsylvania Al1—State
signee who will look to make
an impact on the Pitt offensive
line in the upcoming year.

Pitt went outside the state to
find speed and came up with
teammates Elijah Pompey and
Demale Stanley from Florida,
who both run the 40-yard dash
in 4.5 seconds. Another speed-
ster signee, Jerome Mitchell, is

rated one of the top receivers in '

North Carolina. A

Despite the fact that Pitt has
Big East leading rusher Billy
West returning to the lineup
next year, there will still be the
void left by standout running
back Curtis Martin. To help
give West some support, Pitt
recruited two running backs.
Demetrius Harris, rated as one
of the midwest’s top running
backs, made his oral commit-
ment to Pitt, but his signing has
not yet been confirmed.

The Panthers looked to Ohio
for depth at the position, which
kicker David Merrick vacated
after using his single year of eli-
gibility. Chris Ferencik, a two-
time All-Ohio Division I kick-
er/punter, has signed his let-
ter—of—intent. Ferencik, a
lefty, converted 23 of 27 career
field goals and averaged over
41 yards per punt.

Youndt finished fourth on bars with a 9.4 and
also tied for sixth on rings with an 8.9. ,

Another junior, Chris Sweeten, ended up tied
for sixth on the high bar. This was only
Sweeten’s second meet back after recovering
from a broken arm. He helped Pitt place second
on the bar with a 36.25, behind Navy who had

their best event scoring a 37.55.

Finally, on vault it was Narvaez taking first
with a 9.20, followed by Lannie in eighth place,
scoring an 8.65. Once again the Panthers found

themselves behind Navy, 35.5 to 36.1.

“On everything except for one event we did -
well,” said D’Amico. “It’s just a meet, we took
third. There will be lots of days.”

This Saturday the Panthers travel to Ohio State
to take on the Buckeyes for the ﬁrst time.

“They are probably one of the top teams that
go to regionals,” said Lannie. “We hope it brings

up our level of competition.”

The men will have their first home meet of the
season on Saturday, Feb. 18, against James
Madison and Temple.

well as we could have.”

On the vault Michaelene
Myers (9.40), in her first
meet back from a leg injury,
led the way for the Lady
Panthers. Stevens (9.150)
and Senior (9.10) posted the
second- and third-highest
scores for Pitt.

Stevens (9.35) had the
highest score on the un-
even bars for Pitt. Senior
(9.00) was second and
freshman Kristin Bond
(8.55) took third for the
Lady Panthers.

Pitt had its best event of
the competition on the bal-
ance beam. Leading off was
Bond who scored a 9.325.
Deena Daller (9.325) also
had a big score for the blue
and gold. Leading the way
for the Lady Panthers was
Myers, who scored her sea-
son high on the beam with a
9.40.

“We found our lead-off on

man Calli Bodnar returned
to action and scored
Pitt’s second high with a
9.20. Buck finished third
in the Pitt lineup with a
9.150.

‘‘It was nice to have Calli
back on floor,” Yohman
said. “She did a really nice
job.”

In the individual finals,
Pitt was well-represented.

The vaulting competition
was won by Hansen (9.850).
Finishing second was Karen
Cimochowski of Penn State
(9.80), and tied for third
were Tenli Poggemeyer of
Arizona, Robin Ewing of
Kentucky and Joanna Knox
of Penn State each scoring
9.750. The lone competitor
for Pitt was Senior (8.95),
who finished 14th.

On the balance beam,
Tracy Kerner (9.750) of
Penn State took first fol-
lowed by Jenna Karadbil
(9.650) of Arizona and
Kerry Slattery (9.635) from

and did well,” Yohman
said. “It is nice to have her
back.”

Stevens placed ninth in
the uneven bars competition
with a score of 9.350. The
event was won by
Poggemeyer of Arizona
(9.825). Fellow Arizona
Wildcat Becky Bowers
(9.750) finished second, and
Auburn’s Brown (9.725)
took third.

On the floor exercise,
Hansen (9.875) and
Poggemeyer finished one-
two. Tied for second with
Poggemeyer was Erin
Gannon of Auburn (9.700).
Senior (9.30) finished in
11th place for the Lady
Panthers.

“They [the Lady Panthers]
learned how to perform in
front of 5,000 people,”
Yohman said.

“We learned that if we
perform cleanly, we won’t
look bad against teams like
these.”
