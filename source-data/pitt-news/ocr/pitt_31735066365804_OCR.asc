University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Vol. 55, No. so  

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

In a meeting Tuesday designed
to inform Oakland residents of the
current status of University de-
velopment programs, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar called for. "a new
era of communication and a
larger amount of community in-
put.” ‘

The forum, attended by Univer-
sity administrators, members of
Oakland civic groups,--/-and resi-
dents of neighborhoods adjoining

the campus, was, according to
Bernard J. Kobosky, Vice Chancel-
lor of Public Affairs at Pitt, "an
opportunity for dialogue_ and in-

creased mutualunderstanding.” . .

Posvar profiled the results of
joint planning with the city, the
state, and the community and de-
fined the posture of the University
with respect to the geography of
Oakland. ‘

He stated that expansion is not

Posvar also noted that a stabil-

ment is expected in the next 10
years.

Various members of the audi-
ence challenged Posvar on both

existing plans and future projec-.

tions. A planned Nurses facility

is, one said, offensive because the
new structure would "box-in"

Posvar stated that the air rights.

A nti i -Moye movement loses starch

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A move against Student Af-
fairs Dean Dr.‘ Alfred Moye by
about a half-dozen student lead-
ers has apparently‘ lost much of
"its starch. ,

After a closed-door meeting
with the students and MoyeTues»
day. the Chancellor express-
ed complete confidence in Moye.
and the person who called the
meeting. Black Action Society
Chairman Richard Utley. agreed
with him. '

PERCY SPEARHEADS DRIVE
Spearheaded by General Stu-
dies Student Cabinet Chairman

Gordon Percy. the drive brought
, together students disaffected with

both Moye and Student Affairs in '

general. At " Tuesday ‘s meeting
were Percy. Utley. Wade Lawson.
Lenny Klavonicf Dennis Con-
cilla, Bob Ging and Al Watts.

Percy said it was his “con-
cern to seek information about
what Student Affairs really is
and what the new Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs’ philosophy is.”

During several recent meet-
ings, however. Percy and Move
reportedly argued about the ex-
tent of Moye‘s control over Per-
who

ceives a salary of $1200from Gen-
eral Studies student activities
fees. said Moye asked ‘him to
hold a referendum on the salary
issue. ’

Percy said he will hold such
a referendum but "not because
we've been forced.” ' '

., “The very principle of student .
X5 is that it’s oper-‘ , ,
controlled ‘by students,‘  _W'

government .. . .
ated and ‘_

    

 

  

and it’s very responsive to "stu-
dent opinion,” he said.

The General Studies student
government constitution should

allow for salaries. claimed Percy— ,
the decision he said should not,

necessarily be Moye's to make.
"If he has theiauthority,‘ fine."

‘ he said. "but what's to limit him?“
Concilla charged that the_Task .-

Force that helped nominate Moye,
of whichghe was a member, had
been “used by the administra-
tion.’.’ ‘ , ~ .
"After eight months, when we
were finally getting, it togeth-
er." he said. "I got this nice
little note from the Chancellor
saying thank you for your time.
yourlservices will no longer be
needed.l{iss‘off.' “

' another.

Move’
3 '.,No rubber stamp’.

 
 
  
     

Lawson termed students’ "in-

put in Moye‘s selection insuffi-

cient, and in a letter. to the Chan-
cellor suggested that Moye_ had
been chosen as a token black.

"And finally, Dr. Posvar,“
wrote Lawson, "I don't believe
that tokenism should be used to
justify incompetence and inex-
perience."" -

SOUR-GRAPING .

Student Affairs personnel re-

gard Percy's grumblings as sour-
graping ‘against Mo_ve‘s lfirm
policies. ‘ _
. “Somebody has started to ques-
tion his (Percy’s) operation and he
doesn’t like it,” said one."“He’s
not autonomous and he’d like
oto be autonomous. In essence
somebody has said ‘no’ to him
and he's trying to man mau.”. ,

V "I think to have a person count-
er.gG_ordon in any way is a rather
new experience for Gordon." said
“He has had a rather
wide latitude in determining‘po-
lic_v ever since he’s been in office.“

Moye who took office January
1. said that he asked "to have a
clearly defensible polic_v for pay-
ing salaries out of student activi‘-.
ties fees. ' L‘

“He has expressed the posi-
tion in the past that we should
rubber stamp what he does.
said Moye, "I have taken the
position that while we‘ do not
want to "impose widespread cen
sorship. we will not approve
expenditures which we feel are
inappropriate.“

BAILEY
Reveals Judiciary

Walt Wills defended the resolu-
tion, saying that it would func-
tion. as ,“more a deterrent than
anything else.”

Some Board members. however.
thought ‘that other methods of

Book Center crime prevention

might be explored.
Ken Krenicky and Terry Sadler

.wondered if theft -could be han-

_dled through the Campus Judici-
ary, augmented, suggested ‘Sad-

ler, by a possible increase in se— V

curity.

Terri Weaver recommended im-
plementing the proposal on a trial
basis.

"As a Board." she said. "we
stand behind the present proposal
with the option that after a set
date . . . if the system is ineffec-
tive we can bring it back into the
judical system."

The Board approved a motion
calling for initiation of the pro-‘
posal for a one-term'trial period.
from September to December.

The Board also officially ended

a dispute between the Legal

Awareness Committee and the

»Health Services Organization by

assigning the groups adjacent
rooms on the third floor.

Previously.
had shared an office and had ex-
perienced some disagreements.

"It's time you got together.“
Bailey said to the two groups. "I
don’t think this alienation among
service "organizations is going to
stand." ‘~

After both groups expressed
opinions, the Board unanimously

approved the allocation of room"

320' to the Legal Awareness and
Tenants‘ Union and room 3_21 to
the HSO.

Utley, whodescribed his origin-

_ 'al»stance'in the dispute as “neu-

tral,’-’ said he called the meeting

a ' in‘ order. to air the charges of both
V sides.

After the meeting, Utley said
that . Moye had his "full sup-
port." ‘ ‘

More important. the charges
won little credencewith the man
to whom Moye is ultimately
responsible-Chancellor Posvar.

‘Though he said that Moye
would prepare a set of guidelines
for the accountabilityof funds,
Posvar refuted each charge
against Moye. A

"Dr. Moyewas selected large-
ly because’. of his leadership
ability and because the was a
faculty member with an outstand-
ing record for his teaching
abilities and his work with stu-
dents." he said.

Of Lawson's charge of tokenism.

Posvar said: "Nothing could be '

more absurd."

Though several faculty mem-
bers have declined to speculate on
the formal agreements that may
eventually evolve from President
Nixon's visit to the People's Re-
public of China, they have termed
the trip judicious and long—needed.

"It's a tremendous step toward
sanity." said Irwin Schulman.
professor of Political Science.
summing up the consensus of fel-
low academes.

Robert Newman. professor of
Rhetoric in ‘the Speech Depart-
ment, agreed. commenting that
Nixon has with "one fell swoop
killed the Great-China myth."

“It’s really wiped out the stup-
id attitudes Americans have had
about China for a long time,” he
said. “The resurgence of viewing
China as an aggressivegmonster
just can’t happen now "for a good
while.”

The trip is also ‘viewed as hav-

' ing had ameliorating effects on
Chinese attitudes by sociologist v

C. K. Yang. who traveled exten-
sively through the Chinese main-
land last summer.

As evidence of his theory, Yang
cited the broad coverage of Nix-
on‘s visit in the Peking People’s
Daily and the visit on the first day
of the President’s tour between

Nixon and Party Chairman Mao_

Tse Tung. Both’, he said, were un-
precendented in Chinese history.

The extensive hospitality shown
Nixon also demonstrated goodwill
and an open attitude toward the
United States, Yang added.

"The Chinese have tested the
water and found it warm to

swim," he,said. As a result of all t
. their talks and gestures Yang said
.the “Chinese are convinced the

Americans have good faith."

Though none of the profs inter-
viewed thought
ments would result from this first
meeting,. most agreed that cul-
tural exchanges and trade pacts
might eventually transpire.

Schulman. suggested the Chi-
nese might ask the‘United States

 

« for foreign aid.

 __ Although Peace Corps volun-
‘ teer Janet Simoni and Volunteers
in Service to America—member,

ent countries’ thousands of miles

apart, they encountered similar

frustrations and satisfactions dur-
A ing their service.

While on -campus recently in
.a recruiting drive for Action
'( the administrative umbrella that
includes the‘Peace Corps and
VISTA.) they related some of
their experiences.

l Once a volunteer arrives at
 his assignment. said Cantor. the
, obvious racial, ethnic. or econo-
? mic differences surface immedi-
‘ ately. "I was a white girl in a
black neighborhood. Everybody
wanted to know what I was do-
ing there. People were suspici-
ous.” she said. w

"People were very cold and

r indifferent, with good reason.“
Cantor continued. "I proceeded
to do my job. People began to
know me as a person.”

Simoni, who taught school in
'? Sierra Leone, faced the same type
i- of racial ostracisrii as Cantor.
, There, the people considered her
i different not only because she’s
white butalso because she’s a
Westerner and “thinks in a cer-
tain way,” she said.

Cantor said that she encounter-
ed a communications barrier. "I
«, come from a. totally different
background and‘ evironment."
she said. This “barrier“ plus the
-: fact that she didn’t make many
3' friends disillusioned her. but she
nevertheless considers her exper-

-. «ience worthwhile.

"VISTA gave me. ‘an opportun-
ity to live in a different area.
and work with many different
kinds of people,” she said. She
experienced much frustration.

-she added, but was able to rea-
lize her own limitations.

Simoni cited several things

absent from Sierra Le0ne’S’ cul-

» ture: the time of day and/a cal-.

‘, endar, also newspapers, television
and other conveniences we take
for granted. "You have to get’
used to this.“ she said, and added‘.
"I think every volunteer gets to-

it passes."

Cantor taught in a pre-school —

run by the Methodist Church in
Kansas City. Missouri. Before her
arrival and immediately after-
ward, the pre-school did not, she
said, accomplish its goal of pre-
paring two to five-year olds for
elementary school. Instead. it
could be better described as a
nursery.

In order to achieve its goals
and provide jobs, the school be-
gan to recruit mothers from the
neighborhood to teach.

mitted that publicity about Appal-
achia was a major reason for
her choosing VISTA over the
Peace Corps.

Simoni said that Peace Corps
service is “an eye-opener for
Americans who think they come
from a country with no culture.
You get to see America much
more clearly for both , the bad
and the good.” "

She gained satisfaction from
her experience because: "You

learn at first hand about the cul-'

ture and deal with people on a
people-to-people basis." At no
time did she consider herseif a
representative of the United
States.

tion. Campus representative for

Abortion lawtrlreform ii:

debaterl at

by RICH EZULER"

At recent hearings held in.Har-
risburg by the Governor’s- abor-
tion commission, groups support-
ing and opposing abortion agreed

that something must be done with’

present
laws.

They disagreed. however. on
whatshould be done. T

,Marc Hiller, president of Pitt's
Environmental Action was among
those who testified for the liber-
alization of the existing laws.

"After hearing the 40 testi-

Pennsylvania -abortion

. monies that were presented.” he

said, “I personally feel that no
one can question the need for
repeal of the existing setup.”

Reverend John Tollner, pastor
of St. Luke's Lutheran Church
in West View, testified against
abortion at the hearings, yet he
too recognizes a need for change
in the present system.

"I feel that the present system
of laws in the Commonwealth is
not enforceable,” he explained.

The groups, also disagreed
on the efficiency at the hearings.

Randy Engels and Barbara Rut-
kowski, members of Women Con-
cerned for the Unborn Child,
said that the, hearings were con-
ducted in a slipshod manner.

Both complained about the un-
equal allotment of time to pro
and con speakers, the lack of a
stenographer, and the order in
which the speakers addressed the
commission.

“During the morning session,“
Engels said, "there were 14 pro-
abortion speakers and only eight
anti-abortion speakers. And, the
 seven speakers, not counting

 
   

AND

    
 

hearings ‘  

Lieutenant Governor (Ernest);
' Kline who established the state’s, ,
position, were‘ all-w_..: 

stand. of no
pro-abortion.”

"There wasn’t even a steno-

grapher on hand for the morn.— f ~97‘
mg Session," added Rutkowski.‘

"When we later contacted the
Governor's office to find out who
had appointed the stenographer,
it seemed that no one knew any-

thing about one having been ap- '

pointed."

Rutkowski said that she was I I

disturbed at the way- in which
the speakers’ times were shorten
ed as the day progressed. '

“Originally, each speaker. was
to-have 20 minutes,” she said,
“but later this was adjusted to
10 and then to 15 minutes.” '7

Hiller, however, stated that most

of the measures taken were pracr 7

tical.

“I think the only reason the .
times were shortened was that,
the officials realized that not’
everyone was going to have a
chance to speak,” he commented.

"As to the relative number of-' 
speakers involved, I thought that ..

depended on the number of peo-

ple who wanted to speak for one "  J‘

side or the other.”

As a result of the hearing, the
anti-abortion group has lodged a
complaint with the state offi-
cials.

' The second hearing was held.

in Philadelphia yesterday.. The
third hearing will be held on

theninth floor of the City-County? A

Building here March 14 and the
final hearing will take place in
Harrisburg March 28.

The Governor has asked for the 3
commission’s deci_>s_i_o_n_"by May 1.

Homecoming 1972 seems far away but the
planning for this event has already begun; the
committee is now being selected. Before we stand
by and allow a small group of people to make our

.de'cisions for us, we should give this past home-

cominga thought.

. The day is one of tradition and participation
for all groups on campus, but the celebration

has been a pleasant part of every football season

for years, none of us was consulted before she was.

Committee took it upon itselfto change with the
times and follow. the fad of Women’s Liberation.

Surely a university should keep up with the

,_ times, but hardly on the occasion of a traditional

event.‘ If the celebration is no longer appreciated,
then we should eliminate it rather than wasting
ouractivities fee on a farcical election.

The selection of the Pitt Woman was. with no

Perhaps committee members felt that they rep-

making the change, but the conversation surround-

such support._ The‘ main topic of discussion seem-

qualifications, is the "best looking? »

There are groups on campus that would ‘define
an election for the most pleasant and attractive

female student as “sexist.” Yet no one is forced to"

participate and, I’m sure, the percentage of girls
who would resent this honor is quite small.

There is no reason to take a simple, harmless
tradition and create a national issue from it.

This year. .at least. we should be allowed to
decide for ourselves. Let us vote and choose what
kind of homecoming we want. And if we don‘t
want a Homecoming Queen or Pitt Woman, ‘we
should be able to eliminate the contest.

  prison reforms urged

To the Editor:

I recently visited a meeting of
Alpha Group at the "Western
State Correctional Institution on
the Northside. Alpha Group is an
organization, set up by the ‘men
there to help each other to bear
up during their stay there and
set their goals for the time when
they leave.

The secretary of the organiza-
tion read an eleven-point state-
ment which I think is very ex-
pressive of the wrongs built into
our prison system. I pass it along
to you!

1. “Ironicas it may seem in
this day and age of our civilized
society. we are still living under
the rules of inquisition. the guise
of which is labeled justice. And

2. "I would like to say that in-
stitutions correct emotional and

lie. It's just the opposite;

HARRISBURG, (AP)~The Irlouse

passed a bill Wednesday making

students who register to vote in ‘

another state ineligible for state
scholarships or loans. It was sent
to the Senate.

“Pennsylvanians should not have
to subsidize the education of an
individual who registers in an-
other state and thus gives up Penn-
sylvania residence status,” said

Rep. Mitchell W. Melton, D-Phil-»

adelphia, one of the sponsors.

The measure also would lower
the age of students who‘ must fur-
nish a copy of l their parents’
federal income tax form and satis-
fy residency requirements. Stu-
dents over 18——it’s now 21—would
have to supply the tax form and
would be compelled t live in the
state for one year to be eligible
for state scholarships.

 Nixon ’s yen for travel
icostly for taxpayers

PEKING—(AP) President Nixon‘s trip to China is costing tax-
least $300,000 on transportation alone. Total costs
, could be several times that amount. - '
The White House says it hasn't calculated the trips cost. Some
estimates can be made. however, based on such known expenses as
the hourly operating costs of the presidential jet. ’

But the cost to the taxpayers is dwarfed by the multimillion-

.’.dollar outlays being made by the television networks and other

news organizations to provide coverage of the President's trip.
Media expenses include, for example, 10 cents a word for dispatches
transmitted from China.

Probably the biggest single government expense category is

, transportation.

The Air Force calculates the costs of operating Nixon'sBoeing
707 jet, the “Spirit of ‘76,” at $1,180 per flying hour. Since Nixon’s
round_trip to Pel-ting is taking about 40 flying hours, that ‘figures
' out to $47,200.
Add on- the cost of a backup jet from the presidential fleet,
plus about half a dozen other similar-size government planes now in

- . China, and the govenment transportation tab exceeds $300,000.

For the 87 news correspondents and other media personnel who
flew to China with Nixon in a pair of chartered Pan Am 707's the
round-trip ticket for each was about $2,300 or a total of more than
$200,000 paid forair fare by news organizations. '

One. hard-to-determine government expense category is commun-
ications. '

Nonsensitive communications between the presidential party

I and China and the White House are being handled via specially

arranged satellite circuits.

The White House won’t say how much this costs, but the going
commercial rate for a three-minute telephone call for Peking is $14
plus $4.50 for each additional minute. -

Sources reported the White House several weeks ago reserved
three around-the-clock voice-grade channels on the Comsat satellite
linking China with the United States. Each of the channels can be
split into 22 circuits capable of telegraphic transmission.

I'.The White House has been employing also a facsimile trans-
mission system to send presidential documents from Peking to thg

White House. This requires a voice-grade "channel.

It the White House is paying the $4.50 per minute commercial
telephone rate, the daily costs for
exceed $38,000. ‘

The president and his small official party. as guests of the Chi-
nese government, aren’t paying for food and lodging.

OK. be cruel. Dismiss Long Ago Tomorrow as

an unfair superficial description. the operative

er struck down by an unnamed disease and confined
to a wheelchair. He meets her in a church-spon-
sored home for paraplegics where she has spent the
previous six years. They fall in love. plan to marry.
She succumbs to an unnamed virus (there‘s a lot of
that going around T. He carries on bravely.

No. you haven‘t seen it before. In this case the
summary discloses almost nothing. Although the
lovers are handicapped. the film is the healthiest
specimen I‘ve seen recently, and the most re-
sounding affirmation of life in recent years.

Most of the film’s strength lies in the remark-
able performance of Malcolm McDowell (If . . .,
and the Kubrick opus A Clockwork Orange). As a
critic once remarked, only the most virile actor
can be successfully tender. In such hands there is
honest sentiment, not soggy sentimentality.

M McDowell is virile (even in his wheelchair).
brutal, and sarcastic, striking out savagely when-
ever his unerring nose detects a whiff of sac-
caharine. Consequently. he delivers those six sim-
ple words, “I love you so very much" more loving-
ly and convincingly than any of the candy Romeos
who usually stink up the movies. He is the Nietzs-
chean hero as lover. and brilliant at it. '

He and Nannette Newman exist in a world of
real people—indifferent in-laws. resigned cripples.

pity. Margery Mason strikes the sour note of bene-
volence perfectly as the institution‘s matron.

Real people also face real problems, none of
them magically vanishing with a wave of family »
name and fortune. One cannot but admire the
lovers, who must‘ plan an ordinary kiss with a strat-
egy of mechanics, persevering -in the attempt to
live a normal life. Two adults, aware of their limita-
tions and those of the environment, going ahead’
despite all, is a situation commanding our d_eepest I
respect.. .

Long Ago Tomorrow is plagued by some minor .
afflictions. Its hokey title is not much ofan im-
provement upon The Raging Moon, the book from '
which it comes. They might have spared us the even ‘
hokier Bachrach and David title tune. B. J. Thomas‘
rendition, ‘and its recurrence later on a radio. when S
the matron naively asks. "Is that what they call a

' hit?” I hope not. .

This modest picture is a landmark only by com-
parison with you know what. However, if she in-
sists that you take her to see a romantic movie, take

By ANDREW J. SOPKO
Entertainment Editor

A Good choral groups are some-
what of a rarity these days, es-
pecially in light of the decline‘
of new compositions written with
large choral forces in mind. When
one has the opportunity to hear
a visiting group‘ and new choral
music sung by such a group,‘ ex-

pectations are likely to be high

and the chance for disappoint-
mentjustas-high. ~

The visitof the Waterloo Uni-
versity Choir of Canada "Sunday.
under the direction of Walter
Kemp provided ‘just such an op-
portunity, .-  "

As they offered a program de-_
voted to both sacred and secular
music at Heinz Chapel, (the prob-

lems of~this group were reﬂagiily /

noticeable.

An oversized soprano section
(consisting of more than half the
group) blared forth. while the
mock sound of only a few tenors
was hardly audible. Tenors are
rather difficult to find these days,-
but this is no excuse to have them
overwhelmed by a— ratio of nine
to one in a choral group. The
basses and altos were usually in
good form although the bass sec-
tion was somewhat heavy in the

lower register.
‘This entire _problem narrows

down to the ever important’ as- 5

pect of choral balance.

In addition to a multitude of

sacred works spanning from the

Renaissance to the present day, ,

folk songs of different nations
“made up the remainder of the
program. In this medium, the
competence of the group was" far
more convincing. The program

'. itself was rather lengthy, espe-

cially. for those of us who were
squirming- in our seats at the end
of the first hour. To worsen mat-
ters, there was no intermission.

While most of.the works‘ on

Canadian organist Jan Overduin. ”
,,..a.,.student ofi JeangLar_iglai_s, ”was':_-

present for the two principal
works of " e program-—the Sonata
da Chiesa for organ and the an-
them for choir and organ. God is
rHere—Let’s Celebrate, both by
the Canadian composer H. Bar-
rieCabena. A " -

Although Overduin showed an
interesting technique. the Cabena
compositions were something
less than interesting. The sonata
had its moments but the anthem

was nothing more than ideas bor-.

rowed from Benjamin Britten.’

A SERVICE AGENCY —- A SOLUTION

Though a high caliber of mus-

‘ icianship was-evident on the part

of the.director, the organist, and
the individual soloists, the elan
vital so important‘ to choral mus-
.ic was somehow lacking in the
work of the entire group.
Choral" music requires that each
musician in the choir be a choral
scholar by both listening to ‘him-

self and to the other singers in ‘

the group. When this sense of bal-
ance between the different sec-

- tions is lost. so is the work being

performed.

between his split fromlthe group and his involvement in the peace
movement. His activities in the movement, he said, enabled him to
discover himself away from the group context. “What had been a
unanimous group became three divergent points of view,” he said.
“To respect the equation we once shared, we quit." Yarrow described

music as a universal means of obtaining peace; his solo performances, ‘

he said, enabled him to communicate with people and convey

his goals for freedom. ‘‘I could tell what people were thinking and ‘
feeling. I could test myself. It was-a marriage between my beliefs:

and my music,” he said.

Yarrow’s Wednesday afternoon appearance was sponsored by the Stu-
dent Union Board. He will appear again March 4 at an American

'1’-urlie’ at Nixon

Direct from two years on Broadway. Purlie, the Broadway hit
musical based on Ossie Davis‘ play Purlie Victorious. starts a two
week engagement at the Nixon Theatre Monday, February 28. -

Directed by Philip Rose. Purlie co-stars Robert Guillaume and
Patti Jo. Peter Udall has written the lyrics to Gary Gold's musical
score: while the book is the collaborative efforts of Davis. Rose and
Udall. Louis Johnson is responsible for the choreography. Ben Ed-
wards designed the settings. and Ann Rother contributed the cos-
tumes.

Regarded as genuine American Folklore, Purlie attacks bigotry
with laughter, satirically depicting a high-prancing, gospel-hooting
young Georgian reverend named Purlie, who plots to free his cotton’
pickin’ flock from 01’ Cap’n Cotchpee. Bubbling with frothy humor,
Purlie triumphs over oppression and meanness by reducing evil to
absurdity.

The New York critics were unanimous in acclaiming the show.
Clive Barnes of the New York Times wrote: "This musical should
have you calling out Hallelujah! ‘A smashing crash of gospel sing-
ing and great jazz dancing, the musical blends a fine mixture of
humor and passion. I enjoyed the show and so did the first-night
audience."

There are many snakepits around the
college basketball circuit that charm un-
wary visitors into their merciless trap.
Prominent dens are Penn’s Palestra. La-
fayette’s Alumni Gym ‘and, Fordhams
Rose Hill Gymnasium in the Bronx. New
York. - '

But few schools can count on the home
court advantage as assuredly as the Nit-

tany Lions do when they confront oppon-.

ents on the hardwood surface in Rec

Hall. The 43 year old ediface was dedi-'

cated in March of .1929 and has hosted

‘exactly 300 PSU victories and just 89 de-

feats.

‘When the Pitt Panthers battle the
Lions tomorrow evening in a region-
ally televised game (8 p.m. on channel
11)" they will be fighting a jinx that has
plagued them since 1963. The Cats down-
ed the Lions in that year in Rec Hall
68-48 but haven’t been able to salvage a
victory there ever since. .

The -Panthers are also seeking a bit of
revenge ‘for an earlier season bout, when

. the Staters disposed of Pitt -handily in the ,0
. Field House, 74-62. Since then the Cats

have been hot and cold,iwhile the Lions’
temperature hasn’t stopped scorching.

The Lions. now 15-7 after Wednes-
day’s 80-79 victory overthe West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers. have only lost one

‘ game since theirlast encounter with

the Panthers. That loss. which was also
their "only defeat in Rec ‘Hall this‘ sea-
son, came at the hands ‘of the Temple

_ Owls, 68-66 on February 7.

The Lions‘ most impressive showing
‘since‘Jan. 29 when they beat Pitt, was a
sound thrashing of an overrated Virginia
squad 86-74. Wednesday. Feb. 16. Vir-
ginia’s second loss became the 300th vic-
tory in Rec. Hall. _ - ‘.

sights set on the NIT tournament in Madi-

son Square Garden, is sophomore sensation 0

is averaging 17.4 points and also leads the

Wednesday night. But when the final
buzzer signified an 84-74 victory for the
Virginia Cavaliers overthe Pitt Panthers.

‘one thing was clear-depending on who

There’ was no middle ground Panther

doubtedly one of the mos_t incredibly un-
fair refs that I have ever seen."

\Dejected' Panther Coach Buzz Ridl,
after watching his squad -play one _of
its finest games ‘ever, remained more
composed and refused to comment direct-
ly about‘ the officiating, though ACC ref
Lou Moser gave, Ridl more material to
talk about allnight long, much more ma-
terial .than Fair gave Gibson.

Moser gave Gibson ample opportunity
to be thankful as he blew four technicals

The Cub basketball squad re-
sumes action tomorrow-night in
Recreation Hall at Penn State
and all indications are thatlit
will be an extremely close ball-
game.

In this case team records will

be of little use in comparing the
teams. The Lion frosh sports a
record of 3-5 while the Cubs are
ll-3. ‘

The first time the two teams
met at the Field House. January
29. the Cubs had to battle for their
lives to emerge. victorious. 64-55.
It was not until there were only
five minutes left that the Pitt
frosh managed to pull away.

The game was tied a mere 10
times and the Lions" downfall
resulted from their‘inability to
hold on to the ball as the Cub
press yielded numerous turn-
overs.

The ‘Little Lions are led by.

not so little Lion. Randy Meis-«

ter. their 6-9 center. Meister needs
the team in scoring (16.5) and re-
bounding as well as being an
intimidating force on defense.

The sandy haired. Baldwans-
ville. New York native scored 17
points against the Tim Grgurichs
Cubs as well as completely dom-
inating both the defensive and
offensive boards.

"1   aI‘OuIld llllllllllllIllIIIIIlIllllllllllllllllllllllllIIIIllIIIIlllllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllllllIIllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

Cubs, Lions square off

LEROY FREEMAN
Cub Boardman

Guard Kevin Burke, who tal-

lied 13 points in that game, is

second to scoring only to Meister

with__ a 14 point per average.

Along with Meister, Burke gives:
Coach Casper Voitholfer’s Lion

frosh a talented one-two-punch.

The Cubs. on the other hand.
will be coming off their most
recent and biggest victory against
the Duquesne freshmen last week

at the Field House. The Cubs
will counter Meister and Burke
with some class of their own.

Kirk Bruce. Leroy Freeman.
and Willis Cardot all are averag-
ing close to 18 pts. a game. Mike
Silverman. who tallied 14 pre-
viously against the Lions. and
Ed Williams will be counted on
to hold off Meister defensively.

Bruce had a ho-hum perform-
ance against Penn State. He"
scored nine points, but has been
hot of late. Freeman led the
Panthers in scoring versus the
Lions with 16 points and account-
ed for most of the Cub re-
bounding. A walk on, Freeman
has done, a commendablejob.

Both squads have faced West
Virginia. their only common op-
ponent. The Cubs held off the
bigger WVU team anti won 75-
67. Wednesday. Penn State. lost
to the Mountaineers by one point.
49-48.

One break for the Cubs is that
Joe Hestor. averaging 10 pts.a
game. will miss tomorrow's clash.
as he was injured walking on

campus. That may be a small ‘A

break. but breaks will probably
play a big role in the game. In
addition a crucial variable is that
the Lions will be playing at
home.

When the Golden Flashes from Kent State in-
vade Trees Pool tomorrow afternoons swim meet.
more than mere competition will flavor the spir-
it of the competitors. There will be mixed emotions
and the rekindling of old friendships.

Co—captain Rick Rowe aptly described the sit-
uation as “old home week."

Jim De\/incentis. Kirk ‘Corky‘ Semler, Dan-
ny Dunkle. Jeff Montgomery. and Al Smith are
some of the Pittsburgh boys who will be returning
to their hometown area.

DeVincentis, a much sought after freshman
from McKeesport, Pa., has shown that he was well
worth KSU’s recruiting efforts by setting a fresh-
man record of 0:48.3 in the 100 yard freestyle
against the University of Miami, Ohio.

He and Rowe are good friends ‘but they might
possibly compete against one another if Pitt coach
Richard Bradshaw enters Rowein DeVincentis‘
speciality. the 100 free.

Occasionally this season,Kent coach Frank Vic-
chy has entered Devincentis in the 200 yard free-
style achieving an equally stellar performance from
his outstanding freshman.

"Corky’i Semler, who hails from Monroeville,
is certain to return to a warm reception this_week-
end.

Dunkel and Montgomery are both from Pitts-
burgh.

Bradshaw himself isn‘t immune to these nos-
talgic feelings either. One of his most talented high
school swimmers,Al Smith. from Bethel Park, has
firmly established himself in the Mid-American
Conference.

Already this season Smith has swum a 2205.3
200 yard individual medley and is imporving week-
ly in his new specialty, the 200 yard backstroke.

Bradshaw’s quandry consists of the following:
one of his best high schoolers whom he coached for
for four years. competing against one of his re-
cruited freshmen Ed Cahill. Bradshaw is hoping
that Smith will lose but still wishing the best for him.

Smith has lost to Rowe every time and the two

Tmcksters resume action

The track team. which has been out of competitive action for al-
most two weeks. will resume dual meet competition Tuesday. Feb. 28.

against Edinboro in the Field House.

Tuesday's meet will be the last work-out the tracksters will have
before they take Off for the IC4A‘s March 3. The Easterns will be run in

Princeton. N. J.. this year.

have met in competition. This meet marks the first
time Smith will be competing in the backstroke
event. \

These Pittsburghers complement a veteran
roster with the likes of Gary Bishop, Gerry Muske,
Pat McGinnis, and Tom Hammagren. Of the five
conference crowns coppedby the Flashes last year,
Bishop won two, one and three meter diving; Muske
captured the 200 yard backstroke; McGinnis was
successful in the 200 yard butterfly; while Hammar-
gren won the 1,650 freestyle.

Hammargren and Fred Lewis will lock horns
Saturday. Both are clocked in the 1.000 freestyle
with nearlyidentical times. Lewis appears to be re-
covered from a chronic back ailment and will be
ready for action.

Freestyle Dave Anderson. who is swimming
the best times of his career. is anxious to pick up
some points for the mermen.

This meet, will present an excellent opportunity
for some of the freshmen members of the Panther
squad to qualify for the Easterns. Ed Cahill. Bernie
Victor. and Tom Smith have already qualified, but
as yet Ken Kirkham and Jerry Oleary haven“t.
Hopefully Martin Staley can also qualify in the one-

and three-meter dives. -

Skaters, Lions collide

by BART MACK

It might be "hockey night in
Canada" on Saturday. but one
thing is for sure. it will be "hock-
ey day in Allegheny County." This
Saturday has been proclaimed
“hockey day” in Pittsburgh and
several games will be on tap at
the Civic Arena.

The Pitt skaters will battle the
Penn State Main Campus squad in
the finale of the day. The contest
will follow the afternoon game
between the Pittsburgh Penguins
and the Philadelphia Flyers.

Faceoff for the Pitt-PSU match
will be approximately 4:30 p.m.
Those wishing to attend should
either be on hand at the Pens-Fly-
ers contest or arrive at the Arena
immediately after the game.
There will be no charge if arrival
follows NHL contest.

Saturday’s game will be some-
what of a revenge meeting for
Pitt. The last time the two teams
met, PSU came out the winner by
ai5-4 score. Several skaters also
complained that they were “hom-
ered” at University Park.

On Sunday the skaters will have
an excellent chance to put some
more distance between them-
selves and their nearest division
rivals when they meet Carnegie-
Mellon University. Pitt is pre-
sently 6-0-1 and is holding down
first place. A

Duquesne is in second place.
six points behind Pitt. C-MU oc-

behind the Dukes. A victory over
C-MU would eliminate the Tar-

last time Pitt faced C-MU. the
Panthers skated off with a 3-1 win.

The race for second place will
be decided when C-MU and Du-

 omen   gymnasts prep

or PSU, Clarion meet

by VICKY VETERE

Pitt's women gymnasts are vigorously preparing for their tri-meet
with Clarion and Penn State to be held at Clarion tomorrow afternoon.

Last year’s performances against these two schools illustrates

why the Pink Panthers are working

State defeated Pitt by only four
points with the score 66.2 to 62.0.
Clarion. however. was victorious

A by the score of 86:42 to 69.63 in a.

separate meet against Pitt.-.

In addition. Coach DiCi_cco ad- .

mitted. "Clarion should be even
stronger this year. Last year they
had only one all—around girl. But,
they’ve recruited two more star-
gymnasts from‘ Monessen, Sheryl
Perozzi and Sissy Cietly. These
girls placed in the top ten gym-
nasts of the nation in the FIG (In-
ternational Federation of. Gym-
nasts) nationals held in Washing-
ton, D. C.” -
Realizing the kind of ‘competi-
tion they will face tomorrow, the
Pink Panthers have been polishing

and smoothing out their routines. _

Anne Monahan has been working
on a new mount to compliment her
other moves on the uneven paral-
lel bars. Also performing on bars
will be Kathy Krynock-, Donna» De-
Marina, and Ann Krupa. " '

DiCicco stated, "We’re hoping _

to do better on bars at this meet.
Last year Penn State was weak on‘
both vaulting and bars."

In the vaulting. event tomorrow,
Pitt will have Monahan. DeMa_—

-rino, Sue;Davey, and Krynock.

P

Ready to compete on the balance
beam are DeMarino, Monahan,
Pat Martin, and Judy Zamborsky.-
Finally, ‘Donna Saunders, ‘Zam-
borsky, Martin,
~ will appear in the floor exercise. _
DiCicco added that in addition
to the gymnasts themselves, their‘
manager Leslie Menneti has also
been working hard. “I don’t know _
what I’d do without her. Besides
handling correspondence and all;
