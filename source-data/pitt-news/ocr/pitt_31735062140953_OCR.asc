On Conservatory of Music--Visitors’

Club Strong. _ I

Before ‘an audience that comfort-
ably ﬁlled Carnegie Music Hall, the
Vﬁrst Annual Concert of the combined
musical clubs of the University and
Washington and Jefferson College"oc-
curred last Friday ‘evening. The gath-
ering was a representative one, com-

 prising alumni,‘ faculty and students
of both ins-titutions. , The program of!

fered by‘ the clubs was one of rareIex-

, cellence,-and a credit to the Blue and

Gold and the Red and Black. _
The visitors had an exceptionally

strong mandolin club, which showed»

to advantage in all the numbers
played during the evening. ‘The
readings of “Mr. Kerr were very well
done and pleased "the audience im-
mensely. The W. and J. mandolin

- club did the best work in the selec-

tion from “Faust,” their interpretation
being especially excellent. In ‘fact,

all the offerings of the Red and Black-

musicians were high class,«and showed
careful preparation for the event.
The Pitt clubs probably showed the
greatest strength of the season, both
individually and collectively. The glee
club'was in particularly good voice,
their renditlonof “Tales from Hoff-
-’man,’’ being very artistic.» I

Ashe, Kiskaddon and Clare, sang
with extrpme cleverness, “The Ros-
ary.” ‘ .
The solo work of Cancelliere was
the undoubted hit of the evening, the

 expressive" note of the Italian love
. ballads reaching into the affections —of'
i all the listeners.

Only after repeated
encores was the audience ﬁnally sat-
isﬁed.

At the conclusion of the concert a
dance in honor‘ of_ the-visitors was giv-
en. at’ the Conservatory of Music in
Dithridge street. Only the members
of the two‘ clubs and a few of their
friends were included among‘ the
dancers. . 7

The ‘visiting players were enter-
tained during their stay in the city at
the various fraternity houses. .1

discounted by the terse method of the

The task of preparingtheweekly chron-

work with a zest that meant enjoyment

’ source of contentment to realize that

THE PITT WEEKLY

A NARROW MIND.

A broad grin appeared on the col-
legiate countenance during the past
week on account of the__ action of a
Dean in an institution not a hundred

miles from the University. From the _

facts presented in the columns of the
city dailies, it is learned a very de-
mure and coy maid, who claims the
Margaret Morrison School as her Al-
ma Mater, senta missive to the ready-
made sentiment department of an
evening journal. In the letter, which
ap-
peared a few triﬂing questions regard-
ing the palpitations of a young heart
about to make its ﬁrst ﬂutter. As far
as the paper and the girl were con-
cerned the incident was closed with the
occurrence of the facts just mentioned,

‘but 10 and behold the eyes of a dear

old soul, upon whom the glance of Dan
Cupid never ﬂickered and ﬂitted, feast-
ed upon the terrible outrage. The
Dean was hurriedly summoned,‘ and
in a few brief remarks the fate of the
offending girl was settled by suspen-
sion for the term. There is not a great
deal of food for academic discussion
in the action of aninfatuated school
girl, but the extreme narrowness of
the‘ Dean, who disgraced the young
woman before the eyes of friends and
parents is not so lightly dealt with.

Any institution is unfortunate, that

has at its head such a human clam-
the term is exceptionally rude, but
wonderfuly impressive. The prime
trait of a woman selected to lead a
school of young girls should be a
broad conception of the inﬂuential
principles of life. The Margaret Mor-
rison School has received a large
amount of criticism on account of the
trivial incident of the last week. It
was a small and unimportant detail to
the administration, but the people of
Pittsburgh have received a bad impres-
s1on.

V A CORRECTION.

In mentioning a new instructor last
week, the Weekly was misinformed,
the name Rond was used instead of
Rahn. Mr. Rahn is in the department
of" psychology. , - «

RECORDS SMASHED AT HARVARD.

 

Two records were broken in the an-
nual spring handicap track meenet of
Harvard last Saturday. Paul R. With-

ington, ’12, broke the two-mile record '

in 9 minutes, 34 3-5 seconds. The old
mark held by H. Jacques, was 9 min-
utes 46 3-5 seconds. T. Cable (colored)
’13, threwthe hammer 150 feet 7 8-10
inches, breaking the record of 149_ feet
6 3-8, inches, held by H. Kersburg.

THE OLD STORY.

The chapel argument has been set
forth in these columns so many times
that’ a repetition might indicate the
absence of a suitable theme for week-
ly discussion. The conference called
to meet last Wednesday in the assem-
bly room of Thaw Hall is, we believe,
sufficient justiﬁcation for an addition-
al consideration of the thread bare is-
sue. A careful survey of the situation
reveals the fact that the faculty is
wavering in the solution of the prob-

lem. The students, through the stu-\

dent senate and_ other means have
failed to remedy the dilemna.

case now seems to be a clear one for

the faculty, with two points to observe M
, First, the present chapel exercises are

not‘ succeeding; second, the method
of improving the evil must be string-
ent. The second division of the fore-
going sentence implies but one thing,
COMPULSORY CHAPEL. The Week-
ly makes no hesitation in insisting on
the merit of compulsory chapel, NOT
THREE DAYS IN THE WEEK, BUT
ONE DAY, at which time every stu-
dent mustbe in the space alloted his
class or suffer a cut for the failure.
This is parallel with the plan in
vogue in the leading universities of
the country, and .one, which is the
only sensible scheme in.an institution
of the tpye of the University of Pitt-
burgh. The establishment of such an
arrangement would not necessitate the
abolishment of the present three day
chapel, but would insure one Univer-
sity convocation of a truly representa-
tive character. The remaining two
days could be devoted exclusively to
the ‘religious feature, while the com-

pulsory assembly should be given over

to a weekly lecture of considerable
merit. Religion cannot be forced up-
on an individual, and as such it looses
its true signiﬁcance, but the impera-
tive need of the University assembly
is too evident for disregard. We hope,
therefore, the faculty will not hesitate
to adopt the plan which will mean com-
pulsory chapel one day in the week.

A special to the Weekly from the
Junior engineers at work over the face
of the big’, broad world indicates the.
service in the shops is entirely differ-

where life is not such a hard proposi-

the Junior
class, whose unfortunate lot is that
of an engineer, said to a representa-
tive of this paper, “It is not what it
is cracked up to be.” The expression
is an eloquent one, and designates in a
word the actual conditions found by
the students, who for the ﬁrst time
have had a taste of real 1ife.in the
shops and working places of the world.

Hands are not smooth, as when they
pushed a pencil along the sheet» of a
test paper. But, if it makes better en-
gineers "we will have to abide by the
plan! .

The Juniors will be back in the class

cuse: for. the existence of Pitt and 
and J. was their football teams, and

the extreme satisfaction of winning

the annual game. Joutside of athletic
prowess neither place amounted to
much, in’ the opinion of undergradu-
ates, when speaking of the other col-
lege. In a sense it was a rivalry, but
one, which was not good for either
the University or the college. Today
the situation is changed and the best
illustration of the transition was the
spirited concert of last week. The time
has arrived when the university and
the Venergetic rival are friendly neigh-
bors, working side by side with the
same purpose, that of training young
men for the problems of life. Wash-
Jeff is an honorable foe, well worthy
our "steel, and we hope that the af-
fair of Friday night is but the begin-
ning of the relations which will make
