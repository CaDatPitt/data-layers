was a task to whip up some soap
suds during the opening days.
 There are two major physical
plant problems, according to Curt
Roemele, the equally new direc-
tor of men’s housing. .
No Hot Water

When students moved in this
week, there were no shower ‘heads
in any of the towers, and there
was no hot water above the ninth
floor ‘in Tower A, which has 18

‘ ‘ﬂoors, all fully occupied.

. -Roemele said that this unsani-
tary situation was being cor-
v ‘rected at the moment.

Students were also in the dark

lighting facilities in any of the

said. _ 4 .
The University Book Store
has a desk set up in the lobby,
offering a metal lamp for the
price of $14. _ '
Even though Roemele thought
the housing process was proceed-
ing very well, he found pro-
blems as plentiful as students.
“We had problems of the'mech-
anical process of simply moving
them in,” he said. “Like we’ve had
elevators ‘break down already.
And we had traffic jams in the

basement where the students un-

New Dorms Aid

Academic Aims

M a r v i n Eisenpresser, sopho-
more, summed up the men’s gen-
eral feeling about the new dorms.
“The atmosphere is completely
different from that of the rest

of the school. It seems to ﬁt in .

with normal academic life.

“It helps to" take the students
mind off his worries and gives
him a unique and excellent place
to relax. The rooms, thoughrsmall,
are not at all cramped". Every-
thing is within easily accessible
places for studying.”

“Really great. Nice 0 rooms,”
commented Dave’ Sheaffer. “The
desks are large and there are
good study facilities. There . is

‘fj;"nkg.‘?,.’~ . ..

  

Latecomers Surprise
There are_ approximately 1150

‘ students now housed in the tow-

ers, which is about 62 per cent of
their 1868 capacity." The number
that applied for housing was much
higher than Roemele had anti-
cipated —- or, more important, had
prepared for. I
..“The biggest surprise was the
large number of graduate stu-
dents who required/housing,”. he '
said. Roemele had prepared ten
floors of Tower C. The eleventh
floor‘ is now -being used and
temporary housing was hurried-
‘ly prepared on the fourteenth"
ﬂoor. ‘

There was also a signiﬁcant in-
crease of freshmen in residence.
There are 375 in university hous-
ing now compared to 346 last
year. _

Any Room Here

“Another headache was -that
many students arrived with no
previous application and are ask-
ing forerooms,” Roemele observed.

He credited Arnold Zaks, the
chairman of the residence hall
orientation committee, with
easing his early day blues. “He
has done a terriffic job getting
students into thier rooms, and
set up, while conducting‘ tours
of the new facilities, too,”- said
Roemele.

“One of the engineers told me
the , other, day,” Roemele conclud-
ed, “_that.vit will take a yearto‘

For Theatre I1l’s .

‘Soprano’

Eugene Ionesco’s comedy

prano, will -be presented in Theatre II during the ﬁrstiweek i

In Oct.

of the absurd, The Bald So-

of October, William Kingsley, publicity director for the

University Theatre announced this week. i_
Tryouts, open to the entire University family, will be

held this evening from 7 to 10 p.m. and tomorrow, 2-5 and

7-10 p.m. in 1126 CL.

Kingsley revealed that
would direct the play himself.

“It’s the ﬁrst avant-garde play of
this particular type that I have
ever done, unless you count the
e. e. Cummings Santa Claus
which I once directed in a Phila-
delphia coffee shop.” Kingsley ex-
plained.

The Bald Soprano is the arch-
type of the theatre of the ab-
surd. It is lighter than Cum-
mings. Santa Claus, yet it too
has its disquieting moments. In
the Ionesco play, two people
who have just had dinner leave

‘the dining room to dress for
their visitors. A man and a.
woman arrive at the same time

and begin to talk over a long
series of, coincidences.

Each had come on the same
train, had been married the same
number of years, had daughters
with one brown and one blue eye
and so forth. Eventually they dis-
cover that they had been married
to each other for the past twenty
years.

Funny Kissof Death

The theatre of the absurd be-
lieves that man’s relation to his
environment is absurd. The the-
atre wants to show man in his

horrifying condition——both tragic

The playwrights of the ab-‘
surd treat their characters with
comic ‘savagery. Natural social.
amenities are often brought to
ridiculous conclusions. Kingsley
referred to Albee’s play The
American Dream, where a.

to a social "worker, “Why don’t
social worker matter-of-factlyil

she proceeds to do so.

In Ionescos works, the tradition
of the absurd is evident, along
with the schools of expressionism-
and the ‘French presentational
theatre as typiﬁed by Anouilh and
Giradoux. ‘

Kingsley added that the The-'
atre would also ‘ like to hear
people read for Robert Bench-
ley’s The Treasurer's ‘Report.

 To The Freshmen P

, It has always been customary in the past, for The Pitt
News to welcome, in it’s ﬁrst issue, the new freshman class
to the University. This however, is not intended as a Wel-
come b_ut as a warning. I
of You have all gone through quite a number of welcom-
ings and will undoubtedly go through a number more be-
I fore you arrive at that point when you consider yourselves
members in good standing of the University.

These greetings, however, must be taken with a grain
of salt, for although the University is certainly happy to
have you here, it will not really care if you are later forced
"to leave. I
A University is neither antagonistic nor is it benevolent;
it merely exists, and its existence does not depend on any‘
one individual, and it can therefore not cater to any in-
’dividual. »

The secret in an institution of this sort is to expect no
assistance and then you will not be disappointed whenit is:
not forthcoming. v v ~ to

‘V ‘ 'Remember, part of the learning process is to acquire a

Services Expanded I

‘A cosmopolitan type of University such as this one is
U often faced with a touchy problem when it attempts to
’ ‘service a portion of the religious needs of its students.

In the past, Heinz,Chapel has held services for both
 Catholic and Jewish students each week, but has been un-
‘I able to arrive at a suitable program for the University’s.
;. Protestant population. ‘

‘Realizing this problem, the University has arranged for
a‘ weekly series of protestant services conducted by not only
our own chaplains but also by guest ministers invited here
' from other institutions. This is, we believe, a ﬁne move on

the part, of the University and by helping to ﬁll a gap in the
.2’ f religious needs of the students; it will also serve the educa-

 ‘itionallaims of the institution by providing excellent lec-
 turers and theologians. '

A Guide For Freshmen . . .

Meet Your Aeclministratio

1

n

   

Each year the incoming freshman class is faced
with the difﬁcult decision of distinguishing between
those members of the University administration
whose boots require a constant supply of student
spittle to keep them at the .
proper shine, those who can be
satisﬁed merely with a snappy
salute, and those who are to be
completely ignored. In order to
clear up this perplexing prob-
lem, The Pitt News has taken
upon its manly shoulders the .
job of introducing the admini- It
stratioln-pharoahs, high - priests,
sub-ﬂunkies, and assistant chan-
ce1lors—to the newest additions
to this institution. _

First in ranking in the administration stands
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, better known to
his fellow administrators as ‘‘‘Big Ed,” to the
trustees as “Spendthrift,” and to the student body
as “The Lone Ranger” since no student has ever
seen his face. Besides being Chancellor of the Uni-
versity and Director of the Board of Trustees, “The
Lone Ranger” is also a Studebaker salesman and
the Presidentoof-Equador. His personal fortune is
reputed to exceed the total worth of certain cen-
tral European countries.

Directly beneath’ the Chancellor and about 40

‘yards behind is Dr. ‘Alan C-. Rankin, Assistant

Chancellor of Student and General lﬂffairs. “Alan

C” is “Big Ed’s” right hand man when it comes to ‘

keeping student hair on end, which makes it much
easier for scalping. His personal fortune is reputed
to be on a par with that of certain central Euro-
pean serfs.
Two Deans Named Rush ,

The Dean of Students name is Helen Poole
Rush. .Unfortunately for those freshmen who are

easily confused, the Dean of Women's name is also .

Helen Poole Rush. This difficulty is easily cleared
up if one remembers that the Dean of Women has
Savina_ Skewis for an assistant while the Dean of
Students has only’ Dr. William‘Crafts, who has a
hand affliction which makes it extremely difficult
for him to bend his pinky when drinking tea.

Miss Rush is affectionally referred_to by her
girls as “Moms.”

Up on the hill next to fabled Pitt Stadium

 

By Matthew Swetonic

 

stands the bastion of sweat and blisters known as
the Field House. It contains two more people with

whom most freshmen will have to deal. One is Dr. I

Carl Peterson, head of the physical education pro-
gram. All freshmen males are required to take
either two terms of phys ed or two years of ROTC.
Since most freshmen prefer swimming to bayonet
drill, the hill is usually a main center of
freshmen activity. Y

_The phys ed program is divided into two parts. I

The ﬁrst is to take mice and mould them into men,
and the second is to take men ‘and..mou1d' them
into animals. ' _

A second resident of the Field House is Frank"

Carver, director of athletics. He is a man who be- -

lieves that a dollar a term is not too high a price
to levy on students for their attendance at football
games.
the past few, next year Carver may have to pay
students a dollar to get them into the stadium.
"Prowfeshanal lnganeers"

A littleways down the hill‘ from the field’ house‘

lives Dean Fitterer of the School of Engineering
and Mines. His main job is .to.convince freshmen
that being a professional engineer is more import-
ant than being able to spell it. His counterpart on
the lower, campus is Dean',Martin of the schoolof

V the Liberal Arts whose job is to convince students -A

that money isn’t everything. ,
For those of you who are interested in joining

a fraternity, Parker Enwright is assistant dean of I’
men and advisor to the fraternities. Unlike most .'

Greek enthusiasts, he believes in brotherhood and
not in drinking and carousing. This means that he
is actually anti—fraternity. _ '-

Dr. Douglass Thompson is director of the Uni
versity Health Service and a man who believes that 1
there is nothing for a broken arm like two aspirins
and a bc/>ttle of nose drops. His ofﬁce is located on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Brackenridge Hall. You can’t miss
it; it’s the one without any ashtrays.

One ﬁnal administrator with whom many of
you will come in contact is Dr. Russel A. Dixon,
assistant ‘dean of Liberal Arts.’ His" task- is‘ the
pleasant one of informing. _students when their.
grades have failed to meet the minimum standards

required by the‘ University "for continuing" their A

selected course of study at this institution. He also
peddles bus tickets on the side. i "

 _Students Return in Hurry , A
 Tie- Up Eliminated in Quad;
Unloading Cars Expedited

By ANN HARRISON

Besides the three new boy’s
dorms and the two new cafe-
terias, there was another surprise
waiting for returning upperclass-
men. They found no tie-up of cars
in’ the quadrangle, and no long
wait for ‘carts to take belongings
up to rooms.

  

This situation was due to a new
system devised by Miss Mary ;
Curtis, executive housekeeper,
James Sahlin, manager of the
' Auxiliary Enterprise, and R. H.
Bigger, assistant manager.

 

Using this new method, men ,
employed working around the 
University helped a girl ﬁll up a
cart with her belongings and took
it up to her room for her in the "
freight elevators. Then they emp-
tied the 'cart and brought it right
back down for another girl to use.

Helped at Towers

Men were also assigned to help
the boys move into the new tow-
ers. They were stationed espec-
ially in the elevators, which stop- '
ped only at certain floors, to aid
the boys in getting to the right
ﬂoor.

By the former method, the
students used the carts them-

When Alexander Pope wrote “Hope springs
eternal from the human breast,” he did not

have. the Pitt student body in mind. But if he‘

had the line couldn’t have been more appropo.
A succession of mediocore football seasons
have not in the least dimmed the hopes of the

,;students towards the 1963 season.

Aside from the compli-
mentary remarks about the
freshmen girls, football pretty

tions we’ve heard.

Remarks like “How’s the
-team look?” and “Do you
think we can‘ go to a bowl?”
are heard often. ' ‘

Perhaps there is cause for
‘such talk. After all the team
was ranked 13th in the nation
by Playboy Magazine and

 

‘ BOB SMIZIK
picked the team to play in the Gator Bowl.
However, we can remember Look making simi-
lar pre-season predictions which later proved
completely wrong.

While some magazines and the students may '

have high hopes, we have to reserve our opin-
ion. This team has gotten our hopes too high
too often -

The last time was last summer when we
journeyed to Meadville, Pa., to watch the pre-
season drills. We thought we saw a spirited
team, that was ready to work hard for a win-
ning season. We wrote, “There seemed to be a
tangible spirit, one. that was hardly’ trace-V
able during last fall’s (1l961).3-7' outing.

That ‘spirit, however, faded fast and th
team turned in a 5-5 record. ’

We aren’t the only, one that has been fool-
ed. In the ﬁrstvPitt News of 1961 Jim O’Brien
said of the Panthers: “The team as a unit looks
ﬁt andable to /cope with ‘the schedule which
resembles a mineﬁeld.” The schedule was a

past performances by the football team.
Coach John Michelosen has a talented crew
this year, there is little doubt of that.

But this has been the case quite often in l

the past. Spirit is a vital factor in a contact
sport like football. A team without spirit is
usually in trouble.‘ -
’When one disgruntled senior was reminded-
during last season of all the spirit that prevail-
ed during the pre-season camp he shot back,
“we always have that. We just can’t keep the
spirit going through the season.”
The seems to us to be the biggest roadblocks
to a successful season for the Panthers. Michel-
osen and his staff will have to keep the morale

of the team high. - _

The rumors of dissension on last year’s team‘
were not idle gossip. It was one of the biggest
factors in the down-fall of last year’s team
which-played a vastly over-rated schedule.

The schedule this year is tougher, but the
team is better. They are capable of handling it
andperhaps getting a bowl bid. But they will
have to show that early season spirit through-
out the season to become awinner. -

Coach Bemis Looks Forward

By FRED MARCUS

The annual varsity-alumni
soccer‘ game takes place Fri-

day at 7 p.m. at Kennard -
— Field,,a1though regular var-

sity practice begins only to-
day- D

Varsity coach Leo Bemis will"

be . experimenting d u r i n g the
game with possible playing com-
binations to take over at the

. many positions vacated by grad-
uates.

Chances are there will be three
all-Americans playing for the
alumni — Jerry Bressanelli, Paul
Liberati, and Ron Wyatt. Four

most ‘valuable players — Wyatt,-.

B_ressanel1i, Liberati, and Bill
Eisinger — are also expected to
come _
Reichenbach for Varsity
Nine all-district players are
expected. They’ are Liberati,
Wyatt, Bressanelli, Harold Kipp,
John. D’Amato, Phil Rogers, Eis-
inger, and Bob Murdoch for the
alumni and Dave Reichenbach for
the varsity.
 Bemis said: “If this squad
will work hard in the early part
of the season to attain a high
.level of physical condition and
cooperation, I believe we have
the potential to become a

" smooth ball control team.

" “It will be a young team, but
should have more than usual
depth which could prove a real
asset as the season progresses. It
should be an interesting season.
Defense is Questionable

“The .defense,” he said, “is a
question mark. But we have the
potential.” Bemis expects the
depth to bring out hustle in the
players through competition for

positions.. “If they do hustle,” he
,saic__l, “it overcomes a lot of weak.-
nesses.”

Bemis feels the basic prob-
lems will be coordination and
taking up the’ slack for. the loss,
through graduation of high-
scoring center forward Bob
Cuthbert. .

Bemis is expecting at least 23
players to try out for the varsity
this year. Hard-shooting George
Shimpeno and Reichenbach will

captain Bruno Schwarz‘ moves.

One pleasant surprise for Be-
mis this year is Aldo Zortea, who
had previously played soccer in
Germany and on various Pitts-
burgh area sandlot teams. Zortea

’ will basically be used at center

forward but can play anywhere
on the line. -

Junior College Star

Another surprise is Jay Sprech-
er, a transfer student from
Mitchell Junior College, New
London, Connecticut. Sprecher
was chosen last year as a second
team all-American, and his team-
won the National’ Junior College
Championship. “

Bemis thinks Sprecher has the
skills to help the team- and is a
strong‘ contender to start, prob-
ably at fullback.

In addition, reserves Gene Bal-
kovec, Joe Meyers, _ and Fred
Prinz will be trying hard to break
into the lineup at fullback.

Bemis feels track star Mike
Slutsky, has “improved a lot in
ball handling this summer but his
spot is undetermined as yet. 'He
could possibly play fullback or be
a spot player in the line.” Bemis
hopes to capitalize on his speed.

Small F rosh Football Squad A .,s.f‘_T

Starts Practice This Afternoon E

A goal of any athlete is to
make the starting lineup of
his squad. In the case of the
freshman football team this
mark will never be too far
oﬁ. When .practice begins
today Coach Bill Kaliden will ﬁeld
only 21 players-

Matching the small roster will
be an abbreviated schedule. The
ﬁrst game will be on October 5th
at Annapolis. Last season Navy
rolled up ‘an easy 36-21 Victory
It turned out to be the ﬁnal battle
for the Cubs who had to cancel
their remaining contests due to
injuries; L

iFollowing the ‘Navy encounter
the Panthers will play two more

games in two weeks. The ﬁrst will
be at home against West Virginia.
Later the Cubs will play at Penn
State. The State battle was one
of the two that had to be called
off last year.

Kaliden is expecting a lot‘
from every player. He said, “It’s
too, early to single out any single
boy but we are hoping for a
great deal from all of them.”

he added, “We are not planning
to stress any special aspect of
the game. We intend to work on
good fundamentals.”

The new rule prohibiting red

shirting won’t change any of the

Cub training procedures. Kaliden

  

I

said,» “We are going to stick to“

our policy of letting a boy play
only when we feel that he. is
ready. We aren't going to rush
anyone.”

With such a small squad the
fresh can’t afford anyvscholastic
difficulties, but that may not be a
problem. Kaliden said, “These

boys are good students. They’re 2 r

the only kind that Pitt accepts."

- The UCLA game Sept. 20 will be Paul Martha’s
ﬁrst chance to perform at left halfback and he is
hoping for a repeat performance of last year, “I had
the ‘best game of my career against UCLA, Martha
commented “and I know it will be tough to do the
same again.”

Versatile Paul has played more positions than a
horse better. He started out as‘ a quarterback in his
sophomore year,-was-switched to right halfback and
as a junior and is playing left halfback this year.

Martha is all for the change. “I think I’ll like the

switch, said Martha, “I’l1 be running to the right
when I pass, and this I like.”

Has Own Ideas ’ -
Paul has his own ideas on the Panthers chance

_for the upcoming season. “It won’t be.a 5-5 season,”

said Martha. “We’ll either be great or bust. I thought
We were going to be great in 1961 (3-7), and then we
lost severalkey men due to injuries.” .

“Last year, we just didn’t live up to the ad- _

Vance billing.” _No‘w’I ‘think we will. Of. course

' injuries‘ could wreck us. Mental attitude means
a lot also. Everyone laughs at this, but it’s so true.
When material is good, desire means everything.
We have to get off to a good start.”

Martha isvery out spokensbut is articulate. «“I
don’t believe in making excuses when We‘ lose,” he
said. “Sure we were_unlucky in a few games last year
but we were also lucky in a few. We won two games
by two points and one by one point.

_ ' “Games are still won by good blocking and tackl-
mg. A simple off tackle play can go all the Way. As
for me I like to gamble. Sometimes when things aren’t
going well _I get the urge to throw the ball into the
stands. I Want to win so bad it hurts. I think we will
if injuries don’t kill us.” I

  ‘Cat and Mouse ’

' By MATTHEW NESVISKY
Gunter Grass’ second novel,

Cat‘ and Mouse (Harcourt,
Brace and World, 189 pp,
$3.95) has much in common
with his ﬁrst brilliant work,

- . The Tin Drum: the setting is

Second World War Danzig, the

central character is symbolically

deformed, the mood is Gothically
mystic. It also shines with Grass’
truly original style and design,
which is enough to allow the book
to be admired on its own.

That his second novel is but
one third the size of his ﬁrst does

-not reduce its importance. Grass

is telling a smaller story here

' with much less detail, symbolism,

characters and character studies.
But it has a proportionate amount

-of emotion and meaning, and

when Gunter Grass is writing,

‘then it is important. -

Pilenz_ describes how his
grotesque classmate t e a c h e s
himself how to -swim in order
to explore a ‘sunken Polish
minesweeper with his fellows.
Mahlke soon wins the others re-
spect as he becomes the best
swimmer and diver of the lot.
He becomes a -champion at
ﬁnding items in the ship; he
gives away some of the metal-
lic junk, some he wears around
his neck on, a shoelace to cover
his bobbing mouse.

Mahlke, we are led to assume,
ﬁnds a new world in the sunken
ship. He no longer comes to the
hulk to impress the boys; rather,
the mystery of thesea and ruined
iron of the ship offer him some-
thing which he could never ﬁnd
on‘ land. Mahlke actually ﬁnds a
compartment of the ship which is
undamaged by the water and
there he establishes a home. None
of the others can ﬁnd-it because
they cannot swim underwater as
long as Mahlke.

Arranged Underwater Chapel
, It is suspected that Mahlke has
even arranged a chapel for‘ the
Virgin in his underwater room.
Pilmenz -is altar boy at Mahlke’s
church -and he knows that, al-
though Mahlke does not believe

So ‘easy. . .So economical!

in God of the Church, he has an
inexorable devotion to the Holy
Mother. It is known that Mahlke
often wore one or more medallions-
with the Virgin stamped on them
around his neck. He refuses to en-
lighten anyone on the matter,
however, and as the years pro-
gress, Mahlke and Pilenz drift
fatrher apart.

- Mahlke is eventually called to
war after being expelled from
school for stealing a German
hero’s Iron Cross. On his first
furlough, however, M a h l k e
comes home with an Iron Cross
of his own over his hideous
Adam’s apple. He has had
enough of the Great War Ef-
fort, though; any attraction that
,war may have had for the boy
has been erased by reality.
Mahlke decides to quit the war
and the world that made it.

Pilenz considers Mahlke as one
would a mouse; at times with dis-
