STUDENT GOVERNMENT BOARD _ A
    Board introduces.

Abbey Reighard
S ta ff W riter
Pitt’s Student Government Board is trying to
simplify the process by which student groups
receive ﬁinding. .
Student Government Board President Mike

Nites said the Board, which-is responsible for V

allocating the roughly $290,000 from the
Students Activities Fund to the 350-plus stu-
dent organizations at Pitt, isworkingwith the
Allocations Committee to add more speciﬁc

instructions to the Allocations Manual, which’

guides student groups through the allocations
process. Nites and Allocations Chairwoman
Nasreen Harun introduced the proposed
changes at 'Duesday’s weekly public meeting
in_front of about 15 people. _

Nites said the additions are straightforward ‘

instructions — not previously listed in the
allocations manual — for requesting money
that the Board expected from student groups
during the allocations process. '

Nites said he discussed the changes with -

Harun during an allocations manual revision
meeﬁng last Sunday. “ A
Harun said the additions will increase

March 19, 2014 [The Pittiklevvs I v\/\/v\/v.ipittn‘ews.c0r.n. _

transparency for students within the alloca-
tions manual.

According to Harun, the additions were
rules “the committee and the Board had al-
ready been following in general, so I think
ﬁnally writing [the additions] down‘ makes
things more clearfor student groups.”

One of the additions to the manual will
state that student groups organizing an event
together should make theirallocation requests
together. . _

Atthe Board meetingon March 3, Campus '
Women’s Organization requested $750 to show
theﬁlm“Madame Presidente” on campus. The
Board denied the request in full because Bra-
zil Nuts,_a cultural student organization, had
previously requested $150 for the same event.

Nites said explicitly stating in the alloca-
tions  that student groups working to-
gether to plan an event should make requests
together would help avoid a similar scenario
in the future. _ .

Nites said the Board and the Allocations
Committee will also add to theAllocations
Manual that student groupswill notbe permit-
ted to make multiple allocations requests for '

asingle event. . p’ -
“The requests should not be made in piec-

es,” he said. ‘ . ‘ ‘
The Board would, though, make excep-

tions for students groups requesting additional

ﬁindsbecause of any University policies re-.

quiring groups to make purchases, according
to Nites. ' .

Another addition to the manual will state
that the date of -a scheduled event will not af-
fect the Board’s decision to approve or deny
an allocations request. ’ '

Nites said student groups shouldmaketheir

allocation requests in advance of the event, so i

if the requestis denied, the student groups will
have time to raise their own funds for the event.
“Ifthe request is not sent in soon enough,

' so that it is not possible to hear the request ‘

before the event, that’s [the student group’s]
fault,” Nites said. V T
The Board may be adding information con-
cerning Student Affairs aﬁiliated groups to the
allocations manual, ‘

posed in 2012 would have cut the Univ_ersity’s
general appropriation in half and completely
eliminated academic medical ﬁinding.

“In that one year, Pitt took a $67 million
cut,” he said.

Nordenberg continued, saying that as a
result of the cut and the two following years
of ﬂat funding, Pitt receives the same level of
state funding asit did in 1995. Once adjusted
for inﬂation, the ﬁgure dips down to the low-

est level it has been since the University be-

came state—related in the 19605.

“If funding remains ﬂat, we won’t fall be-
low that level in some senses, but the value of
what we receive will be eroded by inﬂation,
and the health and vitally ofhigher. education

A will suffer,” he said.

And so, upon arrival, Pitt studentswere

_ put to the task of reminding legislators that

an investment in education is an investment
in the future".

Armed with blue folders containing a map
of the capitol, sheets full of talking points
about Pitt’s accomplishments and a list of
the-legislator’s names and office locations,

' Pitt students — ‘dressed in various degrees of

business casual attire — navigated the capitol
building to gain support for the University.
The students made the thr'ee-and~a-half
hour long journey from Pittsburgh to Har-
risburg for various reasons — from taking

A the chance to see the capitol building to dis-

cussing social economics.on campus. ,
Ngoc Nguyen, a junior studying social V
work, is originally from Vietnam, and came

to the event to learn how lobbying works in

I the United States.

“I would like to know the procedures, E
what role a student can play to get involved
in the political process to support higher
education,” Nguyen said. ’ _

Kevin l.i1sky,.a Pitt alumnus who gradu-
ated last year with a degree in political sci- .
ence and English studies, came to settle some
unﬁnished business. He attended the event

"last year and said some of his expectations

from last year’s discussions with legislators
fell ﬂat. H V
Lusky said he wanted to “make sure some

in things arefollowedupwi ,”par'ticularlythe

amount of ﬁmding for scholarships and the E

way the University appropriatesistate money _ I

academically and athletically.
‘ Students were divided -into groups and

assigned to speciﬁc legislators to discuss the

- University and the state of its funding. The

students passed folders on to legislators with
information explaining why Pitt deserves
more funding. 2 l ; .
Some ran into abit of trouble ﬁnding the
representatives to give their folders to in the

‘maze of marble staircases and hallways in

the capitol building.

When the students found the  ofﬁces, .

the legislators weren’t always in. A

The race is part of a daylong initiative

‘According to Debra Lanzarotta, race '
and special project coordinator of Kornen’s

participated in the competitive race last
year according to Lanzarotta, and many
competitors were in the college age range.

“Some people just attend the events
because we have a lot of sponsored‘ events

Among the Pitt students in attendance
last year was Kaylie Springer.

For 10 years, Springer, a senior study— -

has joined the festivities with the rest of

Springer said. “So it’s just a really cool at-

to spark an interest running as more than

Tuesday. Danielle Fox | Senior _Staff Writer
Anthony Tripp said that every effort was
made to make appointments‘with- the leg-

islators and clarify that students would be p

visiting the capital Tuesday. V

“But, some things can’t be helped. They
are in session,” Tripp said. “However, a lot
of staff was available to talk to the students.”

Kelly Phenicie, an attorney who works in '
the ofﬁce of Senate Majority Leader Dominic '

Pileggi, met with a group of students while
the senatorwas in a meeting. Phenicie, a Pitt
law school alumna, was interested in learn-
ing why each of the students had chosen Pitt
and what they were looking to do with their
degrees after graduation. 4

Graduate and Professional Student Gov-
emment Board President David Gau and Sar-
ah Kerrigan, a member of the Governmental
Relations Committee, were members in the
group and are constituents from Pileggi’s
district.

Pileggi said it is always great to have Pitt
students come to the capitol because they
offer “unﬁltered” and “refreshing” insight.

"‘They give very candid opinions ‘about
what they think we should be doing and what

CancelloriMrk Nordenherg’ spoke to those gathered at Pitt Day ‘in Harrisburg‘.

  
   

we shouldn’t be doing,” Pileggi said.
Senatorjay Costa, who serves Allegheny
County, addressed a small crowd of Pitt ad-
vocates at one point. i
“Your work is not done here. It has to be
replicated in your respective communities,”
he said. “Knock on the door of your legisla-
tors and tell themuthe importance of higher
education in this commonweal .”
Students also attended for the opportuni-
tyto see familiar faces in thelcapitol building.
A Phil Kappes, a freshman studying phar-
macy, said he came to meet with his local
representative, and Lusky was hoping to
catch Rep. Jim Christiana from District 15.
Lusky had sent Christiana an email saying
he would be visiting and was able to brieﬂy
meet with him.
Lusky said he had hoped for more time,
but called the day a success. .
“I mean even if nothing changed, at least
they heard us, and that’s the most important
part. We keep getting more and more kids
to come out every year,” he said. “Eventu-
ally it’s going to get through. Any progress

Student Affairs affiliated groups Sunday to

discuss additions the Board will be making to
l the allocations manual concerning the groups,

and they will be meeting with the remainder
of the groups within the week. A

Student affiliated groups are groups
that_-receive annual Student Activity ﬁmded
budgets that are approved by the Board. Those
groups include the Resident Student Asso-
ciation, Interfraternity Council, National Pan
Hellenic Conference, Pan Hellenic Association,
Black Action Society, Asian Student Alliance,
Engineering Student Cabinet and Nursing
Student Association.

One addition to the manual states that Stu-

. dentAffairs affiliated groups are allowed to use

Student Government Board funds to purchase
food for conference events held on campus.

N ites said the purchase of food would al-
low the groups to put on longer conferences
because attendees will receive meals.

The Board will also add to the allocations
manual that Student Affairs affiliated groups
are allowed leadership retreats, for which

those groups would receive up to $2,000 in
ﬁinding from Student Government. ’ i

That amount would not pay for the cost of
food on the retreats, according to Nites.

Nites also introducedabill that he, Harun,
the Board and the Allocations Committee cre-
ated, which states that all Suident Affairs af-
ﬁliated groups’ budget requests will be sent to
the Board foraﬁnal review afterthe committee
has reviewed the budget request.

Nites said it’s important for student groups

, tobe familiarwith the allocations process rules

and procedures, and they should meet with
their allocations liaisons in order to increase
the likelihood of the committee’s approval.

The Board will host more Allocations 101

The Board and the Allocations Committee
have held ﬁve Allocations 101 sessions so far
this semester, and the Board and committee
will hold a Budgeting 101 session tomorrow

B Cost of collegiate football and basketball coaching salaries,

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

College footballand basketball ‘coaches’

back in the old days were simple men
with simple ideals: They weren’t ﬂashy,
but to the point. They served to improve
the welfare of the school by winning

games —-— similar to how professors.

do so by producing research — and
therefore, generated solidarity between
themselves and the student body they

worked for.

Nowadays, it’s a bit more compli-
cated. Division I football and basketball
coaches are -no longer college faculty
whose salariesconsistlof student’s tu-
ition money. Rather, they’re more like

. I rationally autonomous, money-seeking

agents, or maybe "rock stars. Over the
years, they have managed to separate
themselves greatly from the academic
institutions, which they supposedly rep-

resent by taking advantage of the college a

budget crises that have been plaguing
higher education. - ‘ t -

. Everyone is aware that many colleges
across the country have been strapped
for cash lately. The recession and aus-

terity measures imposed upon them‘

by state legislatures caused this pre-
dicament. What many might not know,
however, is that college football and
basketball coaches’ salaries have soared
amidst this collegiate budgetary decline.

This is a result of coaches being
able to use their highly visible posi-

‘tions to obtain funds from other, pri-

vate investors, who mutually beneﬁt
from a successful coach. Basically, in
order to afford a top-tier coach, a col-
lege must have funds funneled in from
other sources in order to pay his salary.
In return for their investment, private
interests receive lucrative marketing

a » ’ both disproportionate and urmecess

rights through the teamthey now par-

tially.own.

However, there are some apparent
benefits that these contracts bring to
schools. For instance, if Nike agrees
to pump some cash into your college’s
basketball program, the company will
pay for all of your athletes’ equipment
and whatnot. The only supposed stipula-
tion is that every basketball, jersey and
sneaker better have a Nike swoosh’ on
it. That has the potential to ease a lot
of ﬁnancial strain on a school’s athletic
department.

The problem with this is that" many
big-time coaches have started to lay
claim to these funds that would other-

. wise go to the students. It’s not like be-

fore when coaches such asjohn Wooden
ensured that private investment money
went solely toward the school’s athletic
department. Alternatively, it’s not un-

heard of now for coaches such as Ala-
bama’s Nick Saban to have a $7 million
per year contract, a good portion of
which is paid for by private investment.
These private investments have be-
come so obvious that they can be found
right in some coaches’; job titles. Take
Duke’s assistant football coach Scottie
Montgomery, for instance. Actually, he’s
not just an assistant coach; he is offi-
cially “the Baxter family associate head
coach and offensive coordinator,” a title
he received after a promotion in early
February. Similarly, Stanford coach Da-
vid Shaw is “the Bradford M. Freeman
director of football,” and Northwestern
coach Pat Fitzgerald is “the Dan and
Susan Jones family head coach.”
Apparently, like college libraries
or lecture halls, college coaches need

wealthy and charitable sponsors in or-
der for them to exist on campus. I sup-
pose it’s generous for private parties to
provide the funds for a coach, thus, sav-
ing the athletic departments some cash.
But why do coaches need such bloated
salaries, when that private money could
go toward so many other things?
Undeniably, good coaches" can do
wonders for a program’s reputation and
recruitment, but a good coach should

also care about the institution he or
she personifies. To that ‘end, college

coaches should not take private invest- -

ment money that could otherwise go
elsewhere — to students, perhaps.
The beneﬁcial attention coaches

bring to. a particulargschool is out—-

weighed by the cost of their bloated
salaries. For instance, According to a
NCAA report, only 14 of the 120 Football
Bowl Subdivision schools made money
from campus athletics in the 2009 ﬁs-
cal year. Oddly, football and basketball
coaching salaries rose ‘during this time.

It isn’t a stretch to think there’s a ’

correlation here. If big-name coaches
didn’t come with such a hefty price tag,
I doubt this would be as muchof a prob-
lem. Still, football and basketball will

always be seen as huge breadwinners‘

for schools, even if numbers don’t add
up. They bring attention to schools that
would otherwise go -unnoticed. ‘Boise
State is a prime example of this: It was
a school unbeknown'st_to national au-

diences prior to the eventualisuccess -A

of their football program. Thegsuccess
and.expo'su»re of. these-programs will
always fserve as a justiﬁcatioriifor col—

high salaries.

Still, the proportion of coaching
salaries to collegiate budgets’ remains
unstable. If football and basketball

coachingsalaries continue to rise, the

potential for other sports‘ programs to

be cut in order to compensate for the"

attention-garnering favorites is pos-
sible. The mission of a university is

. not to create a football or basketball.

em-pire with a five-star general at its
head; the mission is to instead, create
opportunity, something inﬂated coach-
ing salaries undermine. I

Panthers flex muscles with win at home  

 

Shortstop Dylan Wolsonovich was part of Pitt’s offense outburst, scoring two of the 12 runs. Heather Tennant | Staff Photographer

Nate Barnes’
Sports Editor ~

The Pitt baseball team has ﬁnally come
home. V -
The.Panthers officially opened their
season Feb. 15 and has played 18 games
since. But the Panthers were on the road

for 17 ofthose, and they ﬁnally played A

their ﬁrst home game Tuesday against
Youngstown State.

A Playing'on Charles. L. Cost Field for
the ﬁrst time this season, the Panthers

scored 12 runs on 12 hits to notch their
largest victory of the young season by a
12-1 margin against the Penguins. The
ﬁrst home game was appreciated by left
ﬁelder Boo Vazquez, who said it was nice
to play in front of his mother and see fam-

ily members. . -

And in his ﬁrst game at the Petersen
Sports Complex, Junior College transfer
second baseman Mattjohnson went 3-for-
4 and drove in three runs with two doubles,
scoring another two himself.

“You can get a little bit more of a routine

in,”Johnsorf said. “You’re not hopping on o.

a bus, rushing to the ﬁeld, you don’t have
the other team telling you, ‘You’ve gotta
be done at this time.’ You come out, you
can show up to your cages early; get loose
kind of on your own watch.”.

Not only was it nice for the players to

1 return to Pittsburgh, but it was also nice

for the team to get back to winning. The
Panthers endured what head coach Joe’

Jordano called a “very frustrating week- p

end” in Blacksburg, Va., against Virginia

Tech, where they led in each game played
but were swept in the three-game set with
the Hokies. ' .

Postgame,]ordano stated “we needed
that” multiple times in reference to his
team’s’-big win and said he was pleased with
the team’s energy, among other things.

“We played clean defensively, got some
timely hits. Our pitchersdid a really solid
job today, and we needed that,” Jordano
said. “Thatwas just what the doctor or-
dered.” — '

Pitt received a timely hit in its ﬁrst at-
bat when Steven Shelinsky stepped to the
plate with two men on and one out. The

Aaron Watson, a captain of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Ultimate Frisbee club,
wants to make one thing clear about the
sport he plays. h

“We’re not just a bunch of hippies
playing in the park,” Watson said.

‘If you look athis resume and the

team’s accomplishments, it's clear that

Ultimate isn’t just a hobby. After all,
Watson is a collegiate national champion
in his sport, and in 2014, he, along with
four other members of Pitt’s team, will
turn‘pro. . v j ’
p The origins of professional Ultimate
don’t date back very far. The first-ever
professional league — the American
Ultimate Disc League — was founded
in 2010, with its inaugural season oc-
curring in 2012. But after winning the
ﬁrst ever AUDL Championship in 2012,
the Philadelphia Spinners determined
they weren’t satisﬁed with the league.
Jeff Snader, the Spinners general
manager during their championship

run, played an ins_trumental role in the

formation of Major League~Ultimate. The

Spinners moved to the upstart league in p

2013, providing some credence to their
establishment as a thriving organization.

After failing to win the inaugural
championship in the league it played
such a large role in creating, Philadel-
phia and its new general managerjackie
Freedman decided to scour elite college
clubs ‘as a source of talent. With the help
ofa returning player, Freedman’s at-
tention moved toward the University
of Pittsburgh.

Pitt softball tried to play its series ﬁnale
against North Carolina o_n Sunday, but
the team was stymied by cold weather
and frigid rules.

ACC rules prevent teams from play‘-
ing if the weather doesn’t feel warmer
than 32 degrees.

Forecasts say that such an issue
might not hinder the Panthers again,
but as the team moves on, it hopes that
weather isn’t the only thing starting to
heat up in Pittsburgh.

The team looks to end its six—game

losing streak as it hosts Saint Francis
University in a doubleheader today at
Vartabedian Field. - I
The Panthers’ (8-13, 0-5 ACC) wrap
up their five-game home stand when
they take on the Red Flash (13-4) with
the opening matchup slated to start
at 3 p.m. The second game of today’s
doubleheader is scheduled tobegin
immediately after the conclusion of
the first game, at approximately 5‘ p.m.
The Panthers look to right the ship
and capture their first win at home this
season and their first win in almost a
month. Pitt has lost six straight games,
including ﬁve to conference opponents.
During its six—game losing streak, Pitt

has struggled to hit and score runs.

This offseason, she signed five cur-
rent Panthers to professional contracts
for the Spinners, bringing in Watson,
Patrick Earles, James Marcus Ranii-
Dropcho and Max Thorne and resign-
ing Trent Dillon, who played for the
Spinners in 2012 before taking a year
off in 2013. Current Pitt freshmanjonah
Wisch has also been on the Philadel-
phia team since his senior year of high
school. —

Dillon, whose_high school club team
was critical in the formation of the Spin-
ners and the AUDL, played a large role
in bringing in some" of his teammates.
When Freedman approached him about

signing his fellow Panthers, he respond-
ed enthusiastically.

“I know these guys,” said Dillon, a ju-
nior from outside Philadelphia. “There’s
something to be said about playing with
new people, but playing with people that
you’re friends with is the most fun.”

Playing with familiar faces was a big ..
selling point for some of the new sign-

ees as well. ~

Junior Max Thorne, the last Panther
to sign with Philadelphia, said, “I don’t
know if I would have done it without that
influence [of them signing] .”

Wisch, from Glenside, Pa., — less
than 10 miles from the Spinners’ Colo-
nial’ Stadium at Plymouth Whitemarsh
High School e is also excited to play
with his fellow Panthers.

‘ “Playing pro last year, there was only
‘one practice a week, so we were more
spread out,” he said. “At Pitt we’re al-
ways running and practicing together.
It’sgoing to be great to have some guys
I’m so close with.” .
Unlike most other-professional
sports leagues,-though, the MLU allows
athletes to participatewhile still attend-
ing college. The majority of players in
the league are either seniors in high
school or college students and areable
-to play professionally while studying be-
cause the majority of the season comes
after the spring term.-
Ranii-Dropcho said the team under-
‘ stands the situation. _ f
“[The Spinners] really work around
our schedules,” said Ranii-Dropcho,

who will graduate from Pitt this year.

‘‘They’re very flexible.”
That ﬂexibility is not lost on the sign- - '

ees. The Spinners allow the Pitt players
who are going pro to miss a handful
of MLU games that overlap.with post-
season play for the Pitt ‘club team. For
Earles, this was more thanjust a gesture.
* ' He said that allowing them to miss
some games was ‘‘huge.’’A ‘
“They understood that at that point

' in the year, Pitt Ultimate was more im-

portant,”_ said Earles, a junior from

North“Hills. “I really appreciated it.”
None of the players are necessarily

sure about how long they will be able to

continue playingprofessionally.Profes— , ..

his team  3-0. J '
Manuppelli didn’t make it out of the
inning, as he ‘recorded just one more out.
He exited the game responsible for four
runs on two hits and walked ﬁve of the
nine battershe faced. -

Johnson said Pitt’s hitters did a great . v

job offollowing the scouting report on
Manuppelli by laying off his off-speed of-
ferings and then honing in on the fastball.

“Once you start locating in on that fast:
ball, once he ﬁgured out he couldn’t go
to his breaking stuff necessarily _—- he’s a
good pitcher e— but once he w:asn’t throw-
ing his breaking stuff for a strike, it was
easy to lock in and really bear down on
3-1 counts-, 2-0 counts, hitter’s counts,”
Johnson said. “And if not, be patient and
take your bases when he tries to throw the
breaking pitch or the changeup.”

After the Panthers took a lead in their
ﬁrst at—bat, Jordano saw his team enter a
situation similar to their winless weekend

against theHoki'es. Outﬁelder and right-

handed pitcher Casey Roche, starting. on right ﬁeld, loaded the bases by allowing
the mound rather than his usual slotin . a hit and two walks. R ‘

  
   

But Roche struck out Youngstown State
shortstop Shane Willoughby on three
pitches to escape a jam, a moment Jor-
dano said was “huge” in Tuesday’s game.

“Because, you know, we were in that
scenario three consecutive games against
Virginia Tech, and there was that sense
of ‘Oh no, here go again,”’Jordano said.
“And [Roche] came up with a couple of big
pitches and got us out of that. We deﬁnitely
needed that.” i

The Panthers’ ability to escape the
dangerous situation came as a result of
whatJordano and his coaching staff made
a point of addressing after Pitt allowed
the Hokies to come back and win in each

- of the teams’ three games last weekend.

“We wanted to emphasize that we had
to keep grinding, keep doing our thing
until the end of the game,”Jordano said.

YSU scratched out a run in the third
when Phil Lipari led off with a double then
scored on a basehit by catcherjosh White,
which drew the Penguins’ deﬁcit to 4-1.
Casey Roche’s outing was finished after
that, having allowed a run on four hits in

villa went 3-for-6 on the day. For Sevilla,
two of those three hits drove in two runs
in the second game versus the Tar Heels.
Tori Nirschl, who had two hits in three
at—bats, -and centerﬁelder Carly Thea,
who went'2-for~4, also tallied two RBIs
in the second game.

Along with timely hitting, Pitt looks
to continue to field the ball cleanly. The
Panthers have committed at least one
error in their past four contests, two of
which ended with multiple Pitt miscues.

_ The Panthers’ opponent today,
meanwhile, has seen opposite results
recently and has encountered more

overall success so far. The Red Flash I

come into Pittsburgh with a two-game
win streak after going 3-2 at the Capital
Invitational held in Washington, D.C.
But the Red Flash have trouble winning
games on the road. '

Saint Francis’ record on neutralsites
is 12-2, but on the road, the. Red Flash
have won just one of three contests.

. And now Pitt is-pegged with slowing

down the Red Flash, who enter the game
with their own hot hitting. Saint Francis
has seven players on the roster who
have a batting average higher than .310.

Leading the Red’Flash at the plate is

senior catcher and utility player Chelsy g

Cosentino and freshman inﬁelder and
pitcher Alexis Bower. Cosentino leads

’ the team in hitting with a robust .412

batting average, while Bower leads the

teams with 21 RBIs and has the second— .

best batting average at 2396.
Overall, the Red Flash are hitting an

A average of .317 while opponents only

are managing a .270 clip against its
pitching. p  y
The Saint Francis pitching staff has
also been strong. The team’s ERA is 2.41,
and despite allowing 117 hits, the Red
Flash have surrendered just 51 runs.
