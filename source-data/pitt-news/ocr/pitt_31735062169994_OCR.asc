  

The following statement was
issued by the Concerned Stu-
dents and Facultyduring "a press
conference held this morning in
the Social Sciences building.

On Tuesday. March 11. the Concern-'

ed Students and Faculty of the University
of Pittsburgh gathered toopen our Univer-
sit_y. During the next three days. we held

discussions on matters which rarely arise -

in the formal University program. All ac-
tivities were non—violent and non-disrup-
tive.

We were concerned with three general
matters: The curriculum of the Universi-
ty. the making of decisions in the Univer-
sity. and the relationship between the Uni-

versity and the community.

Discussions of these issues resulted in
the following specific proposals:

1. All University policy meetings should
be open both for hearing and discussion.

2. The Open University we have begun
here must continue. and a permanent,
space and appropriate allocations must
be reserved for this purpose.

3. As a first step toward restructuring the

relationships in the University. we ask
for the abolition of the grades of “fail-
ure" and “withdrawal." In such cases.
no notationjshall appear on the record
of the student. We also request that the
formal compilation of Cumulative Qual-
- ity Point Averages be abolished.

4. All University and SAGA Food em-

ployees should be paid at least the Fed-

eral Minimum Wage of $1.60; we be-
lieve this constitutes a moral minimum.
We also propose the elimination of all
discrimination in employment of Black
people and women.

Further, as part of a consideration of
the University’s relation to the commun-
ity, we propose:

5. The opening of all physical education
facilities to the immediate community
with no double Standard.

6. University aid in relocating people dis-
placed by expansion.

7. A categorized list be published of all
University defense contracts.

The Concerned Students and Faculty
strongly endorse the efforts and demands
of the Black Action Society of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, and further support the

the Chancellor in his attempts to imple-
ment its program. Moreover, we endorse
the timely efforts of the New University
Conference to reform rules and decision-
making processes.

The seminars and meetings revealed
other shared concerns. Particularly. in
light of the University's clear responsibil-

ity to the community. we hope to discover

in conjunction with our neighbors, ways
of using the University's facilities, funds.
and manpower for the benefit of the com-_
munity. 0

We urge all elements of the University .

community to join us in exploring these

and other concerns through the Open Uni- '

versity which we have initiated. A

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

About 110 students and faculty
of the University‘s School of Phar-
macy. vowing support for the‘ ad-
ministration and Dr. Posvar.
staged a protest yesterday against
the students involvedin the Free
University.

The clean-shaven protestors
lodged‘ complaints against The
Pitt News, and held mass meet-

ings with Assis-

tant Chancellor NEWS

of Student Af-

fairs Jack Critch- ANALYSIS
field and Dr. Pos-

var to discuss their grievances.

The group’s spokesman George

Doperak said the protest "wish-
ed to alter the opinion of those in

Pittsburgh who believe that this

The demonstrating members 
the University’s School of Phar— '

macy presented The Pitt News
with a statement that pointed out
the following:

The Pitt News is run by a small
clique that badgers.the admin-
istration.

The Pitt News continually sup-
ports the minority.

The Pitt News is not representa-
tive of the majority of the stu-
dent body.

The statement suggested that
The Pitt News become more ob-
jective andrepresentative of the
majority sentiment of the stu-
dents.

 

University is composed entirely
of individuals who are more in-
terested in disrupting the pro-
cesses and destroying the author-
ity of the administration and fac-
ulty than in obtaining an educa-
tion.

“Recently various small seg-
ments of the University commun-
ity have decided to disrupt nor-
mal university procedures in a
variety of ways,” said Doperak.
“They have attempted to back the
University and administration
against the wall.”

The group's major complaints
against The Pitt News concerned
the newspapers delight in badger-
ing the University administration

and its continual support of the"

minority. Members of the group
suggested that The Pitt News
should become more objective

 

 

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

and be representative of “stu-
dent"opinion. ~

The anti-protest demonstration
unfortunately received a great
deal of press coverage. The Pitts-
burgh Press put the story on its -
front page. and the local media
gave the story a great deal of at-
tention. This can be understood.
The local media wants to play up
protestors who wear coats and ties
and talk "responsibility" rather
than covering. the issues of the
"bearded groups." The media. the
administration. and Dr. Posvar
were pleased with the groups in-
anity.

The coverage, however, was one-
sided. At no time did members of
the media discuss or investigate
the credibility of the gr_oup’s
statements.

The group wants the public to
know that the University is not a
haven for radicalism where dis-
sentors are more interested in dis-
rupting the authority of the ad-
ministration than obtaining an
education. This is utter nonsense.
If the anti-protest group had both-
ered to read information or to at-
tend some of the sessions in either
the Common Facilities building
or the Social Sciences building.‘
they would see that the Concern-
ed Students and Faculty are quite
concerned about education.

They are so concerned. in fact.
that they are willing to spend
months researching curricular re-
form. They are so concerned
about the academic relevance of
the University that they want to
restructure the Universtiy to make
it a community of learning rather
than a meat processing plant that
processes suburban computers. In-
deed. the demonstrators from the
School of Pharmacy displayed a
tremendous lack of responsibility
in researching their first conten-
tion.

Another point made by the"

group was that small segments of
the University are attempting to
back the University and the ad-
ministration against the wall.
Again, the group’s researchers

failed to adequately research this ’

point. They failed to notice a re-
cent Time magazine article that
indicated that some 60 per cent of
the nation's college students sup-
port the demands and requests of
the “dissident’minority.” A simi-
lar poll was taken at.Penn State
that upheld this figure.» ' .

The‘Students’ March 011 C

The percentage at this Univer-\

sity may not be quite thathigh.
At any rate. there are more than
a mere handful of students con-
-cerned with reform at the institu-
tion. Over 1000 attended the
teach-in Tuesday night. Aside
from this. there are some points
where the Concerned Students
and Faculty have supported the
administration.

The group supported Dr. Pos-
var in his defense of the ROTC
decision and institutional autono-
my before the State Senate Ap-
propriations committee. The Con-
cerned Students supported Dr.
Posvar’s opposition to the Flem-
ing legislation. And leaders from
so-called liberal groups have
worked closely with Dr. Posvar
and the administration concern-
ing University-Harrisburg rela-
tions. This cooperation has sub-
stantially improved the outlook
for the University in Harrisburg.

. The group’s research here,
seems to Have been somewhat less
than academic. They were guilty
of what Speech Professor. Robert
Newman calls a “faulty general-
ization” — using inconsistant facts
to reach a conclusion.. This meth-
od is usually used by groups’ that
are presentinga very weak case.
And such is the case with the
Pharmacy group.

The most highly deficient ar-
gumentation, perhaps, concerns
the group's concern with The Pitt
News. They maintain that The
Pitt News is run by,a clique that

   

Cathedral 

I.=inoAy, MARCH 14, {erg '_

' likes to badger the administration.

Contrary to popular belief. The
Pitt News is not run by a clique.
This year the.editor was selected
by an all-student executive board
which included two members en-
rolled in ROTC. The board meets
monthly to discuss The Pitt News
policy. And the editorial board-
a group of students with wide-

spread views and interests—makes»

the decisions concerning editorial
policy.

Beyond this. it is the right of
The Pitt News or any newspaper
to badger or criticize anyone or
any institution. And last week an
editorial was published praising
Dr. Posvar for his defense of the
University before the legislature.
In recent weeks the newspaper

  Press Coverage Rapped

The following is a statement issued by the
Concerned Students and Faculty last night:

 
 
 
 
 

As The Pitt News recently has said. the local'press sometimes
constructs its own verion of the news. This was the case with the
coverage of the last three days of the Open University.

The Concerned Students and Faculty acted non-violently
and without disruption throughout the three days. Sen. Flem-
ing’s statement. Chancellor Posvar's remarks. the petition of the
Engineers and Pharmacy students: all are blind to the facts.

Quite simply. it was the administration which acted with-
out logic. with little reason. and with a hint of violence (by get-
ting the injunction). There was no interference with any class-
es or anybody in the University on the part of the’ Concerned
Students and Faculty. It was the administration which used dis-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ruption and confrontation politics.

Sen. Fleming. Chancellor Posvar. Pharmacy students. Press:

 
 
 
   
 

face the_ facts. H

. than fight or work for the better-
.ment of the University.. Column

V few people take advantage of this 

has been working closely with ‘
the administration concerning :the«,-,.,"-A"
Harrisburg dilemma._ Is this bad- ’ 

. gering the administration?

The group is upset about The’ _—
Pitt News support of minority pos- 
itions. Unbeknown to the Pharma-
cy group, no newspaper isvrespon-5”
sible to the majority on any ma-
jor issue. This would be a blatant
prostitution of the Free Press. Any
newspaper reserves the right to
make an independent judgment 
in spite of- public sentiment. No, 
The Pitt News is not representa- ‘
tive of the “students.” The news-.
paper is, however representative .
of the views of its editorial board. , 
A parallel here can be drawn to ’
any government. If 60 per cent of .-
the'-nations wants to liquidate the _
Blacks, should the government =- 
abide by the majority decision? n

The most disturbing aspect of
this “student ‘representation busi-
ness“ is that the majority of- the
students at this University are
lazy. They would rather spout  ._ __
forth dull. inaccurate platitudes  A »

 

space in The Pitt News is always -_ 
open, and the policy of publish-x. 
ing outside columns of any per-
suasion remains intact. But very"

 

opportunity. They complain,
nonetheless about an unbalanced V
press. Well The Pitt News can’t  

solve the problem of human sloth.

The tragedy of yesterday’s an- 
ti-protest march is that the group _  
revealed the very “irresponsibil- ’
ity" it claims to be fighting ,
against. . -

' ‘ Assinwall,

" In an article in Sunday’s Press, the

1 ..This Week Magazine, Bergen Evans.
 Ph.D., a professor at Northwestern,
 who writes newspaper magazine arti-

cles, points to two major problems on
the campuses today.

One is that the students are grossly

  overworked_at tasks that are meaning-
" less and irrelevant to them. And the

other is that they are kept in humiliat-
ing dependence, treated as children,
long after they have become adutls,”
he notes.

With the current problems here,

 9- - Dr. Evans’ words seem to carry a spe-

cial meaning. He attacks requirements,
such as language and distribution of
studies, concluding that universities

' Ushould “led the special courses be: re-

served for those who desire special
knowledge.”

’ In a recent meeting of English ma-
jors, it became very obvious that those
who desired required courses not only
were undecided about what they want-
ed to do after graduation, but felt that

- a revision of requirements and special

courses for those who. desired them

‘would eliminate the required “core”

courses. .
' In addition to many who feel that

A 1 abolishing the language requirement

would mean abolishing the language

: ' courses, there are many who feel that
‘ abolishing credit for ROTC would

abolish ROTC courses, and that a stu-
dent voice in the affairs of the admin-
istrators, faculty, and trustees which

:" pertain to students would mean total

control of the University by the stu-

dents.

In his article, Dr. Evans goes on

A -to suggest that the main reason stu- ‘
. dents are overworked is the “Ameri-

 Editorial

i Credit ability

cans are licked in the concept that ed-
ucation can take place only _in school
buildings and in four-year periods . . 

Add to this Dr. Evans’ suggestion
that learning only takes place when a
student has time to wonder about him-
self and what he is being exposed to
(fellow students being just as impor-
tant‘as books and teachers) and one
has a concept of education that is quite
different than the one presently being
employed.

But there must have been sugges-
tions similar to Dr. Evans’ made in
the past. Why, then, are the majority
of students willing to concentrate more
on credit hours, QPA’s, and honors than
on learning? Why are administrators
and teachers so slow to react to pro-.
posals that urge a more modern mode
of education to coincide with the mod-
ernization of society in general? "

A thousand answers could be giv-
en, for each person accepts the status
quo for his own reasons. But the ques-
tion that I would like to raise is simi-
lar to Dr. Evans’ final statement. He
says, “But surely those who can teach
themselves should be given as much
credit—and as many credits for doing
so—as those who have to have someone
teach them.”

So, why don’t students who pursue
an education outside of the confines
of offered courses receive credit? Stu-

dents who participate in the band, in-

Student Government, in theatrical pro-
ductions, in_ publications, and many
other activities should recieve credit.
Just because this has not been done in
the past, why can’t it be initiated in
the fall term?

The Pittsburgh ‘Post-Gazette, editorial:

_ “The encroachment of hidebound legislators on,
‘traditional sanctuaries of free inquiry represents a
greater menace to university life than any turbulence

The power to withhold state funds is the power to

. Phlegming Bill '

By MARC 4 SIMON
Staff Columnist

I've been ' getting the latest develop-
ments in Harrisburg on my exclusive hot-

. line to the State Senate. Everybody knows

about the Flaming Bill, but how many
people know about the Phlegming Bill?

The new Phlegming Bill was introduc-

‘ed to the Senate by Senator Robber

Phlegming (Whig) of
Pa. Now,
not many people have .;
heard of the good and
great Senator Phlegm-
ing. Well, he’s the one
who introduced a bill
to outlaw the sale of
airplane glue in this '
state because, as he put
it, ‘.‘First airplane glue
-4 then banana peels —— who knows what
_i_iext!?” But now Senator Phlegming has
come up with another bill which he feels
will put an end to all the campus troubles
beseiging our universities.

HIS BILL STATES:
.Whereas college students are sub-

versive. and whereas -their activities
are not always known to the campus ad-

 ‘ ministrators and protectors because of

 
 

..,‘~';{ '

   

 

 

the ‘said students’ secretive ways, be it
hereby resolved that from henceforth
all college students be required to wear
a bell around their neck so we higher-
ups know where they are and what the
heck they're doing! '

Senator Phlegming told me that this bill
was really designed to help the college stu-
dent. He said. “Because we’ll know the
whereabouts of all students. we'll be able
to keep them out of trouble. They won’t
be able to sneak off to any secrdt meetings
where they might hear a lot of nasty stuff.
We'll be able to keep an eye on them and

see that they learn the right stuff. the .

stuff we think is important.“ »
“BUT SENATOR Phlegming,“ I asked.

“won’t this "procedure limit the student’s _

freedom?“

“Certainly not, you smart-aleck," he
retorted, “the student is free to be what
we want him to be.”

Just then I -remembered the story of
how some mice tied a bell on a cat’s tail
to enable them to know when the cat was
around. I asked, “Well, what happens if

the bell falls off or the students take them_

off? And what- if they put the bells on you?

Well, strange to. say. Senator Phlegm-
ing choked on his phlegm.

Junior ‘Enlightens’ Other Students

Editor. The Pitt News:
I am writing this letter for the simple

purpose of enlightening or waking up the
-majority of the student body-. Much that

has transpired on campus since Septem-
ber of 1968 concerning student participa-
tion I think should be made obvious to
those students who did not take part.

It is my belief that a university is a
place where minds can open or are opened
to the ideas and principles of life. This is
a very vague and general concept, but it
must be the basis of a university in order
for a truly academic atmosphere to exist
and grow.

This can come about only if there is an
earnest desire on the part of the student to
question. learn, and speak out on what he
feels is truth. Already the dilitante stu-
dents are wondering, “How in the world
does all this concern me, all I want to be
is an engineer. or a doctor, or a teacher.”
Well,’I will give you some examples of
how University life should have concerned
you.

Let me reminisce a tender point of the
ROTC discreditation. This was accomplish-

ed because several students in reputable

positions (SG. Academic Cabinet, The

Pitt News )' spoke out on what they thought

Dear Sarge . . .

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reference to Barbara Sargent’s let-
ter printed March 10, 1969:

The whole idea is thatmany of those
organizations which presently include the
word “university” in their names -are not
really universities.

There are qualities which should char-
acterize a university which are missing
from many “.universities.” Pitt is to a
great extent one of these “universities—in-
name-only,” or so we believe.

The point of present student and fac-
ulty demands (demands only because re-
quests are called “acceptable in principle”
and then ignored) is, that this “university”
does not deserve the name, but. since it
does have students and teachers. it should
be" changed so that it deserves to have
these students and faculty. deserves to be

called a university.

The problem is that this “university”
requires attendence at lectures, the learn-
ing of “facts,"‘the writing of examina-
tions, evaluations of students’ work, grades,
a set cirriculum. course requirements. re-
quired courses. the assumption of the cor-
rectness of a statement only because it
comes from someone who has “given a
decade of study to his discipline."

These are. however, not necessary ele-
ments of an “academic environment." In
fact, they particularly hamper the develop-

' ment of a true academic environment,

where by this I mean an environment ded-
icated solely to learning. The reasons why
we believe this are discussed constantly-
if you disagree or feel that you have con-
structive comments your help would be
appreciated.

Come to any rally. teach-in, or meet-
ing. and speak up.

Mrs. Sargent. “regimentation." "re-
quirements.” “examinations." “grades.”
“and the rest” are not necessary for learn-
ing. They make it more difficult. Just be-

cause something is now does not mean

that it is best.

I Sincerely.
Thomas L. Reynolds
.— Department of Sociology

was right. They felt that a great wrong was
occurring by giving ROTC academic cred-
it, so they went through the right chan-
nels to abolish it.

Yet previous to this, at least one man-
date was made by the voting students in an
SG election to keep ROTC as it was. Why
did all those students who voted to keep
credit not stand up in support when the
value of ROTC was questioned? Were
this the case, the outcome might have been
different.

This was a splendid example of either
student ignorance or disinterest. Either
the students did not know what they were

voting for or they did not care enough to *

do anything about what they thought.
Here, students. is aniexample of our lack
of responsibility.

Another prime example which should
concern the majority of the student body,
the commuters. occured within the past
week. I hesitantly took part in the wanton

destruction of the quite inactive Commu-

ter Association.

I The reason I attended this meeting was .

that I felt the basic problem, parking, had
not been remedied and I wanted to know
why. To my dismay the CA was function-
ing something like a club where friends
nominated friends, and no one said any-
thing about how they wanted to solve the
problem with plans and ideas for the fu-

V ture.

It is even a fact now that the city has
decided to raise the hourly rate on meters
from ten cents to 30 cents an hour; and
the only people at the meeting who com-
mented on this were a newly represented
minority at CA meetings whom I will lab-
el “interested students.” '

Even when. these students spoke out in
question of the past non-successful poli-
cies of the CA. there was but one of the
22 former members who offered anything
in defense. ’

This either appears as a gross igno-
rance or apathy on the part of these “mem-
bers.” If the “hard driving” commuters of
the University cared at all about their own
problems they would have questioned and
made suggestions to the CA earlier. This
again fellow students is an example of
lack of responsibility.‘

A final example is that of the Senator

Fleming legislation. On this issue more .

student interest has cropped up-than in the
past which is a good sign. yet this small
increase.is not enough.

This bill affects every single student
on a personal level because it is a strong
beginning of the surpression of the rights
and freedoms necessary to a university
community.

Whether you are for or against this
bill. make you opinion known and talk to
other students about it. By not taking a
stand, you are neglecting your basic re-
sponsibility as a student, to yourself and
to the University. A

In conclusion. I believe that the aver-
age Pitt student can too easily be typified
as a disinterested. uniformed individual,
and oblivious to his role in the society.
It is our responsibility to question and to
wonder why the daily ritual of being a stu-
dent must be so boring.

Why must we as students be told exact-
ly what we are allowed to think. how we
are allowed to go about it. and when we
are allowed to question? I am not advoct-
ing revolution. I merely assert. “Don’t ac-
cept; question! (Or at least think out
loud.)

‘ Freedom: The Sun, The Beach, The Water?

J)

W’

By PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

Sometimes I think life is a series
of drastic changes. When I think back
to my freshman year, when I look
at the picture on my freshman I.D.
card, I can’t believe it was me.

My discussions with people used
to be very picayune. “Who ya go out
with last Friday night? Was she ac-
tion? Did ya get anything?” I used to
be only concerned about what people
thought of my actions and how much
money I was going to make. I desper-
ately wanted to own a Tudor Mansion
and drive only a Rolls Royce. I wanted
to be cool; I wanted to be the suave
stud. A

That was last year and all my pre-
vious years. Those were times when
I walked around this campus with ‘my
eyes closed. I was an empty shell back
in those days. ButI have changed.

’Hundreds of people have changed.

And the University has changed.

Fraternities used to be the big news
on this campus. Four years ago, it
was terribly important to get into the

right “House.” I remember seeing.

friends of mine cry when they went
up to Parker Enwright’s office of the
Fifth Floor of Schenley Hall, open
up their bid envelopes, and read the
traumatic words, “NO BID.” Other
than the “fraternal spirit” and phony
social climbing, people didn’t real-
ly have profound interests back in
those ancient times. People just didn’t
botherto think. '

Time went on, and some people
“made-it” and some people flunked

out. I miss so many faces. I know so P

many people who failed to regurgi-
tate knowledge in A, B, C, form. But
back then, nobody seemed to care.
It was each man for himself. Profes-
sor' against student, and student
against professor. I constantly sensed
a mutual fear between professor and
student a few years ago. .

And even last year —— the junior
year for the graduating seniors —
many of us were caught up in the clois-
tered rat race of the campus. Every-
one was in a foot race for the Tap day
honors. It was the heyday of petty
politics. I remember making deals
with people. I remember living in
psuedo-fear. And I remember the hat-
reds created by our own puerile stu-
dent standards. These weren’t the
hatreds of political ideology, but the
envy of personalities. How trite things
were last year. .

If I can say one thing about my year
as editor of The Pitt News I can say it
was a year of change for the newspa-
per, the University, and myself.

The newspaper has made many
changes. The first thing we did was
to change the format of the editorial
page. And we changed some of the
ideas. Becoming more political, we
voiced our support for Robert F. Ken-

I nedy. He was the future.

And when Dr. Martin Luther King
was assassinated at the end of the

term, we put out a special edition.-

I’ll never forget the tears in my eyes
when I attended the memorial service.
I’ll never forget blindly running over
to my office. I’ll never forget locking
myself in my office and writing.

In the spring the ‘newspaper be-
came even more political. _And when
Bobby Kennedy was killed. I thought
the world was coming to an end. I
sensed that the society was sick. And
that took 21 long ignorant years. _

And then the newspaper, in the
summer, devoted itself to‘ student
rights._ And we blew some adminis-

trators’ minds when we ran our first
edition of the fall with a front page edi-
torial calling for a restructuring of the
University. And we blew some people’s
minds when we wrote that Black peo-
ple are human beings, and that the
BAS was a good thing.

The newspaper hit ROTC, and
Senator Fleming’s repressive legisla-
tion. I guess a lot of people think the
newspaper is radical. But what the
hell do we have in this academic com-
munity or in this society about which
we can be conservative? Not much,

_ is my answer.

And as the newspaper changed,
as student government changed, as
increasing numbers of students chang-
ed, the university changed. All of a
sudden, people were opening their
eyes. Students tired of being told what
to do and how to do it, began reject-
ing the pacifying platitudes of the ad-
ministration. And a human movement
started. In the area of academic re-
form, Ken Schueler and Joe Kociubes
caused some fundamental break-
throughs. Students began to sit on fac-
ulty senate committees (a prepos-
terous idea two years ago). An inter-
disciplinary major was created.

An Undergraduate Council to dis-
cuss College of Arts and Sciences
curriculum was formed. And the stu-
dents sitting on the council even had
a vote. God-damn, times have chang-
ed.

This campus was once a dead,
place. But now students of the “left”
and the “right” are voicing opinions.
Once the haven of the hush-hush, the
University has become a forum‘ of

debate; the campus is now a place of

student intellectual discourse; It is

now even a campus of emotional dis-
course. In a sense, apathy is beginning
to die. People are becoming more and
more committed to their ideas. And
like~Joshua Chasen, people are be-
coming impatient with the same old
bureaucratic crap. Students have been
hearing the same lines for years.
When I can go into an office of a mem-
ber of the Student Affairs staff and
can predict the answers to my ques-
tions, I too get impatient. '

This impatience has caused my per-
sonal change. Before I was. editor,
I was somewhat gregarious. Now
I spend a great deal of time alone.
In about four weeks I’ll be leaving this
campus, and lately I’ve been walking
around this place late in the evening
trying to retrace my four years. I
try, now, to put my life in perspective.
And now I realize that the past year
was one of great personal importance.
In this lonely fourth floor office I have
laughed, cried, screamed. and slept.
I have been alone for a year, and I
have learned to live with myself.

It is not easy to take criticism.
No one really enjoys receiving hate
mail. And no one likes. to be threat-
ened. I have received a great deal of
personal criticism this year, and I
welcomed the remarks because stu-
dents were reacting to the newspaper.
And when someone gave me a rare
compliment, it made me feel great.

The most beautiful thing anyone
ever said to me was recently uttered
by a senior on campus. “Paul, I real-
ly enjoyed that article you wrote.

After I read it, I cried; it was the most

‘ Ir.

beautiful thing I_ ever read.” When I
heard‘ those words,I was fulfilling a

good function; I was reaching some-

body. Everything fell into place. In
a sense. I was freed. I knew my bag,
and didn’t give a damn about anything
anyone said. \

Over a period of time I guess, all of
us have a few happy moments and
many depressing moments. Some-
times I wonder whether all of life’s
hell is worthwhile. After all, in this
society the cards are stacked against
the human being.

No one gives us a birth choice.
Nobody asked me if I wanted tobe a
WASP, Catholic, Jew, Buddhist, White,

Black, Rockefeller or Vanderbilt. Most '

people, including my Jewish self , were
born with a strike against them. And
more than anything, birth —— that very
beginning of life — shapes a human
being’s future.

And the future. It’s so hard to map-

the future. It’s so‘ damn hard to find
out who we are. It’s so damn hard to
throw off the societal shackles that
enslave our brains. '

I think I have woken up from my
22 year long sleep. My only hope is
for my peers to wake up before all of
us will be human moles living in the
darkness of the caverns never, never
again to breathe the fresh air of free-
dom. —

All of us must suffer,.»but all of us
can be happy if we make the effort.

Live life to the fullest degree, my
friends, but don’t become your own
slaves. . " ‘

indicated assistant coach Bob

every school has one or two boys
capable of winning. It should be
a much tighter tournament.” ~

Adams ‘flt will be difficult, but

peting athletic squads this past year.

Without a" doubt, this year was the
worst yet. The teams didn’t just lose,,
they got whomped. And so, this writer
is forced to break with tradition. I can-
not view the future with optimism.

The big complaint now, and pro-
bably forevermore, is still football. For
the past two years, the Pitt News has
tried to remain constructive, only to re-
ceive little positive reaction. After
seeing five football games lost by
more than 35 points last year and only

a change in coaching made, it is hard A

to remain constructive.

Status-quo policy making leads only
to stagnation and eventual deteriora-
tion of a program. Even winners have
to constantly update. A

But everytime a different suggestion
is raised as to improving the lot of the
Pitt athlete, the standard rebuttal is
that the faculty won’t stand for it. “We
can’t lower standards for athletes.”

After speaking about this with var-
ious non-Athletic Committee faculty
members, I can see the validity of this
point. Although some cared very much
about having winning teams at Pitt,
the general feeling was that there are
many more important things than ath-
letics. '

One professor said that big-time
football was a necessary evil in get-
ting national recognition for the Uni-‘
versity, even when the team gets"clob-
bered. If it weren’t for this point,
many faculty members would favor the
discontinuance of intercollegiate
sports.

Another was more concerned about
the money being’ spent. He referred

hate seeing a bigger slice of the pie
going to the Athletic Department at
the expense of an expanded Social
Sciences department or the develop-
ment of a Black Studies program.

Personally, I have come full cycle
on the question of big-time football.
The stand generally presented in the
paper was: do the things our opponents
do, or de—emphasize and get out of the
big-time. Always willing to make a few
‘exceptions for athletes, I leaned to-
wards the first solution.

Seeing no changes forthcoming, hav-
ing examined the faculty attitudes a
little more closely, and having wit-
nessed the absolute worst season in
Pitt football history (and having watch-
ed the concurrent deterioration of the
character of the athletes as well), I am
now inclined to agree with the faculty
member who said paraphrasing, “foot-
ball is a great sport and those people
who want to play should. But Pitt
Shouldn't spend so much money and:
take the sport so seriously.” In effect,
"he meant eliminate football as we

know it now at Pitt.

I can’t buy eliminating football en-
tirely, though. But it is time that Pitt
schedule people they can compete with.
That might put the fun back in the
sport andremove some of the anguish.

It is essential for Carl DePasqua to
realize that the Pitt he’s coaching in
1969 is not academically the same Pitt
he played for in 1949. If he does, he’ll
see that finals are no time to have
spring football drills

The drive to make Pitt an academic
community is stronger than ever now.

education, and apparently not to sup-

On the Limb at the Easterns
I ' Analysis by Roy Jacobs l l .

The high point of every wres-
tler’s season is the tournament
at the: end. And so the Pitt News
prognosticator (19-5-6, .791) tries
his slight—of—hand at the Easterns. ‘

We sure would like to Pick
Bruce Unangst sentimentally, . but
Since Rich Meyer
of Lehigh is out, Temple’s Wayne
Boyd -should take the title. Bal-
mut of Penn State and Patten of
Army rate shots —, and so does Un-
gast if Adams can wrangle him

Navy’s Dale Stahl is strong
and consistent: He’s the favorite.
After that it’s a scramble be‘-
tween. Larry Cuba, Dana Balum
of Penn State, and Princeton’s
Al Uyeda. If Cuba's consistent.

‘ Fireworks. Both Mark Payne
and Dave Pruzansky of Temple
are dropping down from 145.
They should meet in the finals
if Navy’s Steve Comiskey or
Army’s Mike McBeth don’t get
in the way. We like Payne. ’

‘Clyde Frantz looks to be sitting
pretty with hismain competition
dropping to 137. Again, there’s a
scramble behind him, headed by
the varsity’s Pat Lavery and
John Homiak of Franklin and

A A wide open class. Navy’s Bob
Christianson is 8-2, but Lehigh’s
Tom Muir is a good tourney wres-
tler. Army’s Mark Hoffman is one
of the two who beat Christianson.
and Penn’s entries"

No Optimism in Sports Forecast This Year?-

ply professional athletes (although
some .universities are able to ful-
fill both functions).

Pitt could save itself a lot of money,
time, trouble, and embarassment if its
demphasized football right now. The
move would certainly strengthen the
school’s stature as an academic insti-
tution. Besides, it would release funds
that might better be used elsewhere
in‘ the Athletic Department or, even
more so, elsewhere in the University.

The more aware we become about a
meaningful education and a well-direc-
ted life, the more apparent it becomes
that sports —— except as a Profession is
generally irrelevant to us. It is fine for
sports to serve as arelief from the day-
to-day mundanities, but it is senseless
to get all uptight about a losing football
team.

I did get uptight about a losing foot-
ball team. I did my sports thing for
the past year, and only in the last
month or so did I come to see how
futile the whole business is.

I know many people are going to be
offended by this and I am sorry. I
have had the pleasure this past year"
of knowning and Working with fine
people like Dave Hart and Dave Adams
and Bob Miller (who very few non-
athletes know). I merely reflect what I
think is a growing attitude on this
campus. And a growing feeling of my
own.

This time last year, Sports Editor J ay=
Rosenstein said the Class of 1972 had"
a lot to look forward to. They still do,
if they learn to put the proper per-
spective on their various experiences.

Sports isn’t the big thing anymore.
It just isn’t worth it.

"Ralph Cindrich finished the

Three Enter

Tracksters in NC’s  

by ED CONLEY

Jim Banner doesn’t stay in
one place too often. . Right
now he is completing another of
his three—day recruiting jaunts
which leads him into Detroit and
the NCAA national track cham-
pionships.

The coach will meet his assis-

tant, Gary Meckley. and three_

of his thinclads in the Motor City
today prior to tonight’s opening
of the two day affair, one which
will bring together the country’s
best collegiate tracksters.

Banner decided to cut down on

the entrants in the ‘meet after view-
ing his squad in the IC4A confron- .

tation of the top stars in the East,
last weekend. The tracksters
didn’t look too well in that meet,
and things would be a lot rough-
er in Detroit. »

A couple of the athletes were
strong enough in the IC4A’s to
raise their hopes for the nation-

als, though. One of them was’.

Bryant Salter. The thinclad jump-
er grabbed a fifth place in the
high jump, failing one-inch short
of the top spot.

“If he doesn’t miss any jumps

and he goes 6'8” or 6’10-” he has '

a chance to place,” Meckley
mentioned. “He’ll have a real
good shot at 4th or 5th.”

Salter may test the field in the
triple jump, too. This is an event
that he excells in, when he gets a
chance at it. He broke the varsity
record in his first indoor crack at
the jump two weeks ago in the
Delaware Invitation. ‘

“If he gets some luck — it’s his
specialty, but he hasn’t had much
practice —— he can do well in the
triple,” Meckley decided.

Someone who didn’t haveany
luck in the IC4A’s was Smitty

JERRY R|CHEY_
1 Another Chance

Brown. He missed the finals in

V the 600-yard dash (the event he’ll

be in tonight) because of a dis-
qualification, but went on to prove
that he is capable . of beating
the best, anyway.

Smitty turned in a great per-
formanceanchoring the mile re-
lay team. He was seven_yards be-
hind Villanova’s Larry James
when he took over in the chase.
When the race was over James
had crossed the finish line first.
but Brown had closed the gap con-

'_ siderably. The thinclad lost the

race by .3 seconds. L g
“He was actually faster than

‘James in the quarter-mile,” Meck-

ley noted. “He got a lot of con-

,fidence from that race. You’ve

got to be with the best when you
beat James.”

The Villanova speedster set the
IC4A record in the 600, Satur-
day, missing the world mark by
only .2 seconds. Needless to say,
he’ll be in the 600 again, tonight.

Banner’s relay team won’t be
in Detroit, though. Brown is a
major part of that group and its
entry could only slow Smitty
down for the big‘ chase. All ath-
letes have to go through the trials
before becoming eligible for the
finals.

Jerry Richey couldn’t get
through the mile trials in New York,

.but he’ll‘ get another chance in

the NCAA meet. Despite the poor
showing, his coaches know what
Richey can do.

.“He’ll have to run .a smart
ract,” Meckley cautioned; “You
can’t make any mistakes in the
nationals. There are too many
other guys that are good.”

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

Last night began the first
phase of the three day Eastern
Intercollegiate Gymnastics
League Championships at West
Point. Nobody from the gym-
nasts will perform until today in
as much as last night’s competi-
tion was only for all-around per-
formers, those gymnasts proficient
at all six events.

The gymnasts will have five

they will have the chance to com-
pete tomorrow and a chance at an

Coach Warren Neiger feels.
“The competition is very tough.
There’s two boys, Barry Weiner
from Temple, last year’s Eastern
champ, and Bob Emery of Penn
State, that will be very hard to
beat out for first and second place.
About five other gymnasts in-
cluding me will be fighting it out
for third place.”
