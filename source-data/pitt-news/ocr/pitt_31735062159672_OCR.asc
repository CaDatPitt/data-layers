Dick Phillips, Dick Minnear, Nick

Roslovich, and JerryKrantz, and the
Women's Choral Trio'with Beverley
Schmidt, Marie Curraso, and Shirley

one on stage -- 150 voices -- to
sing the Hallelujah chorus from
the° “Messiah” and the "Dutch
Song of Prayer.”

Directing the choral groups will
be Dr. Theodore’ Finney, in charge
of Heinz Chapel _Choir and Pitt
Singers, and Colin Sterne in charge

Club. Robert Ziegler will accompany
both Men’s Glee Club and Women’s‘
Choral. Pitt Singers accompanist
is Marian Baeslack.

For all of the choirs, the Choral
Jubilee climaxes a busy year of
singing engagements both in Pitts-
burgh and outlying districts.

Men's Glee Club has done the

' most travelling--from nearby Altoona

to Chicago. Heinz ‘Chapel Choir
has recently returned from a trip
that included Philadelphia, Lig-
onnier, and Bellaire. Women’s
Choral leaves tomorrow morning to
join the men of Penn State’s Forestry
School for a combined concert in
WayneSb0r0- The Pitt ‘Singers trip
is scheduled for May 7 and 8’ in
Emporium and Clearfield. ,.

Tickets for the concert are being
sold at the Student Desk, by choir
members, and at the door. The
price" for students is $.75, while
the regular price is $1.00.

Vet Deadline
Emphasized

The deadline for veterans to
start a course of education and
training under the GI bill is only
15 months away-—July 25, 1951-

New regulations issued by the
Veteran’s Administration explain
that ex-GI’s who are still under
the training program at that time
will have the right to continue
their courses. Those discharged
after July 25, 1947, and those who
enlisted or reenlisted under the
Voluntary Recruitment Act are also
entitled to the college program. *

Veterans who complete or dis-
continue their GI training after the
1950 date may not start another
course, according to the new re-
gulations.

The VA has also stipulated con-
ditions for changing courses. This
is permitted only when the veteran
isn't making satisfactory progress
in the course, or when the new
course is more in keeping with his-
general aptitude.

According to the regulations,
changing a subject within an elec-
ted course, and adding or dropping
a subject, are not included in a
change of course, and are permis-
sable.

co ed a P t

"Dirty politics,” long a charge directed at the men of Pitt

and at fraternity men in particular, took a new turn last week.
Ray l\faher,a strong IF leader, did the twisting,hitting at women’s
politics and their "well oiled political machine,” significantly
on the day before men’s elections. He issued his written assault
through the News’ “Letters to the Editor” column.
 Senior Court promptly answered with the women’s side in
-another letter to the News, citing several errors in Maher’s letter
and defending the election and appointment of the officers of
women’s organizations as falling strictly within’ non-political,
ability‘ boundaries. The women’s reply treated primarily errors
of fact rather than his basic allegation, yet missed the point that
’ tends to discredit much of the attack.

It amounted to the pot calling the kettle black. Maher, during

his year's reign as a "power” in fraternity and student govern-
ment politics, has certainly not gained a reputation as one who
‘labored to clean up men’s politics.
Nonetheless, he did score when he referred to the women’s
“machinery. Senior Court says, "Facts, not misinterpretations,
- speak.” And it is a fact, no matter how accurate the Court’sclaim
that nominations and appointments involve solely ability, that the
\machinery exists through which just such “a situat,ion as Maher
decries could be perpetrated.

We mean the procedure by which candidates for office are
selected. A nominating committee chooses two candidates for an
office and places them on the ballot. No others can petition for
a spot. Nominees are announced less than a week before election
R day, thus restricting campaigning. This rigid system could be
used to completely shut out any opposition, if those in power so
decided. Despite the barrage of ammendments the voters faced
this spring, this machinery, still exists virtually intact.

Senior Court ducked this point in their letter and insisted
that all is run on the up and up in women’s circles. Politics is
shunned, the coed leaders argue. This argument is hard todefeat,
for, so long as no evidence exists to prove incompetency , a con-
crete case cannot be built tying the women in office to sorority
P membership or something akin. About all that can be done is to
infer, as Maher did.

The women’s government setup, though, is open to the same
serious criticism as is its male counterpart. Little attempt has
been made to encourage or permit a very large percentage of "non-
greek” students to participate in activities. This must be corrected
if Pitt is ever to extract the most benefits from its activities

V Pitt politics needs and airing.
Various student writers, including this columnist, have attemp- .

ted at times to present and analyze the political situation bearing
on Student Congress, IF Council, Men's Council, and the various

women’ s organizations.

For the most part, such attempts
failed, since the authors lacked
complete information and were not
qualified’ to discuss their topics.

Added to this, was the apparent
lack ofinterst of any but a relatively
few studenfs in campus politics o_r
government.

Not Surprising

This disinterest is neither sur-
.prising not open to much criticism,
since the machinations of the eighth
and twelfth floors rarely touch the
great majority of students.

dent Association.”

student offices have been driven
behind the scenes and underground,

areas which have never been noted '

as being particularly clean.
It is not surprising, then, that
some of the\ lower tricks of the

political trade are employed again,

and againiby amateur politicians
here.

What is amusing, or as more than
one person has termed it, ridicu-
lous, is that such tactics have been
dragged outovercontests foroffices
which have absolutely no import-
ance other than the doubtful pres-
tige which accompanies them.

Even campus leaders admit that
student government organizations
have " very little power, most of
them degenerating into debating
societies with little constructive
results to justify their existence.

Therefore, the grave concern with
which elections and actions of
such bodies are considered by the
campus wheels appears laughable

to onlookers.
Too Much Politics
Nor is it these students alone

who take their politics seriously,
since it is the administration which
forbids the farcical demonstrations
an; ralliescommon to othercampuses
on the grounds that it permits “too
-much politics to enter into the selec-
tion of student officers.”

Of all the stupid statements made
around here, including a few of my
own, that is the most asinine.

It is impossible to take politics
out of politics. If University auth-
orities are concerned with the
moral aspects of student elections,
let them drive the politics out into
the open rather than attempting the
impossible. .

’ Men’s Council this week passed
a resolution for next year's Council
to the effect that more opportunity
for campaigning be allowed, not

that next year's Council will have _

any more power to obtain such a
concession than the current one.
The permitting of suchcampalgns
would not only bring about the in-
creased student interest that the
eighth floor experts have been
crying for, but would put politicking

on the same plane as the legislating

that follows it. Both would then be
reduced to a level approaching the
ridiculous, with everyone having a
lot of fun and no one getting hurt.
Then the pages of the News won’t
have to be cluttered with serious
dissertations and exposures of a
subject which has no value and is
interesting only from a humorous
standpoint. .
About the only group who will
lose out under such a change is
the News, who will have to look
elsewhere for page two humor

Lcolumns. Frankly, we can afford it.

Goose Bay, Labrador, was no

Sunday, according to Theodore F.
Hatch, professorin the Graduate
School of Public Health who re-
cently returned from a world tour.
He arrived at Labrador in the mid-
dle of a cold snap.

Mr. Hatch was one of the three
United States delegates to the In-
ternational Conference of Experts
on Pneumoconiosis, a disease on
the lungs, which was held at the
University of Sydney, Sydney,
Australia. Twelve Countries par-
ticipated in the conference.

Following the two week con-
ference, Mr. Hatch went to Singa-
pore, and then by motor launch
through the canals of Bangkok,
capital city of Thailand.

Delhi, India was the highlight
of the journey, according to Mr.
Hatch. He was also very impres-
sed by the Taj Mahal in Agra.

A Communist riot almost spoiled
one of five days in Rome since it
tied up transportation. ‘

London followed Rome. There
Mr. Hatch spoke at the Medical Re-
search Council Laboratory studying
coal miners’ Pneumoconiosis.

Labrador, where Mr. Hatch spent
Easter, was the last lap of. the
journey which had begun February

Pirates Get Into the ‘Festival’ Act

By GEORGE BARBOUR
Aside from pitching baseballs, three Pittsburgh Pirates will
enable students to pitch pennies during the University’s annual

By DAVE POLLOCK
The big shot among racqueteers
at Pitt doesn’t rule his mob with

a rod, but his weapon proves just
as deadly when he and. his boys
go out on a ‘job.’

’]ohnny Lohstoeter, No. 1 man
on the Panther tennis squad, blasts
volleys off a piece of wood and gut
that seem to travel as fast as a
bullet.

A big‘ six foot, 203 Pounder,
Loihstoeter’s net philosophy is
power and more power .if you have
the physique and durability torput

\it over. “My service and volley is
the bestypart of my game,” reports
Johnny, "and it’s based on speed
and power.” . A

Met Name Gridders M

Before he began playing tennis
at Shady Side Academy five years
ago, the Pitt ace was a football
and baseball star. He played half-

for the baseball squad.

It waslin 1944 after Lohstoeter
entered the army that he began
banging noggins with the elite of
the football set. While at Fort
Bragg, Johnny played against the
Iowa Seahawks _in A1946 for the
service fo tball championship. On
the navy squad were such standouts
as Buddy Young and Elmer Angs-
man, so Lohstoeter’s Fort Bragg
eleven lost, 24-il4. 

"I had one of my best days
against the Seahawks,” says the
blonde bomber. ."I scored seven
points and set up the others. It
was my biggest day in sports.”

where'd ne G9?

Johnny had offers from a number
of schools to play football, in-*
ina University, but he turned them

down because of a bad knee and

some advice from tennis coach Dr.

David O’Loughlin. '

Since ?*he wanted to study medi-
cine, Dr. O’L0ughlin suggested‘

Tennis Coach Dr. David O’
Loughlin will present the same

but have not been able to find a
-single one of truth to the claim.
Consider the scores which ap-
peared in the last issue of The
News. ‘Not one game had less than
ten runs scored. The average ran
up in the high twenties.

: It seems that Intramural Director
Leo C. Bemis and the majority of
team captains and managers agreed
this year to limit pitchers to a
straight underhand throw, thus
giving birth to a new type of pitch-

L ing which propels the ball toward
home plate on a five-year plan.

-Kills Sport

One line of reasoning behind

\ this new rule is that it eliminates
arguments with the umpire over

'Whether the pitcher is exceeding
the legal bounds of a side-arm

if delivery. What the reasoning amounts

;to is eliminating the game to eli-

Vminate’ the arguments.

When at basehit becomes dirt
cheap you haven’t got a competitive
‘ sport anymore. You have a calis-
thenics session in bat-swinging.

, A second reason advanced in
behalf of the rule is that it will
free the game from the monopoly

stingy in giving out hits. Now, the

From here on in, everyone is
going to be a Ralph Kiner. yet I
wonder how much fun Ralph Kiner
would find in hitting home runs in
the Sally League. In other words,
how much satisfaction can an intra-

homer off a pitch that approaches
him like a dying man?

Very little, I suspect.

With this dandy new underhand‘
twirling in vogue Miss L. Jean
Younginger, who heads the W0-

ROTC Frat
Organizing

Tentative arrangements have
been completed to establish a unit
of Pershing Rifles, a national
honorary military society, at Pitt.

The society is both social and
functional in nature. Its purpose
is to promote a higher standard of
drill and military bearing.

Active units are already estab-
lished at Duquesne and Carnegie
Tech. There are 65 companies at
the present time in universities
and colleges across the nation.

The society was founded by
John J. Pershing at the University
of Nebraska in 1894.

Pitt has at the present time two
honorary organizations for military
students, Scabbard and Blade and
Prop and Wing.

Charter membership in the Persh-
ing Rifles will be open to advanced
and basic students of both air and
ground ROTC. After the charter
membership has been filled, en-
listment will be open to basic,
corps students only.

Interested students should con-
tact Captain William Motatelli of
the Military; Dept. for further in-
formation. -
