Chancellor Will Answer

At Assemlily

“Questions for Students»

on Friday

Uiiiversitv to Suspend Third Hours
F01‘ Discussion of Student Queries

Student-prepared questions will be answered by Chancellor John G.
Bowman before a University assemblage in the Soldier’s and Sailor’s
Memorial hall Friday du.i'iiig' the third hour.

Third hour classes will be dismissed to permit all students to attend

the first chzmce1l.or’s assembly en-
tirely for students ever conducted
in the liistory of the University.

Dr. Bo‘.\‘man‘s talk, the outline
of which will be published in the
News, will consist of subjects of up-
permost interest to the student, de-
termined by a poll conducted
through the statistics committee of
the Student-Faculty association,
sponsor of the assembly.

TA student union is the topic in
which most students are interested,
the survey showing 14.2 per cent
student interest votes.

Fraternities and the division of
the cost of education were the next
two questions of uppermost inter-
est. Both received 13 per cent. of
the poll votes. The question of
dormitories was next with 12.5 per
cent.

Students Question

Percentages were compiled utter
a questionnaire had been circulated
upon which students were to mark
their fir.-tt, second, and third choice
of interest with space provided for
questions not written on the sheet.

Questions were written under the
general headings of ﬁnance, hous-
ing ai:-cl student facilities on camp-
us, fraternities, administration, and
alumni and public relations.

First step -‘toward preparing the
questions, which were submitted to
the chancellor and upon which he
will base his talk, was taken when
Joseph Roberts, BA41, SFA presi-
dent, announced that students
should submit «questions .to th.e dean
oi’ men’s ofﬁce. .

Using the written questions re-
ceived by the dean of men’s office
and those gathered by the SFA
members, the questionnaire was
composed and circulated.

Original nqtiiestions and the re-
sults of the _poll were submitted to

end.

Hughes, Ruane

At Style Show

The cloud of secrecy which has
surrouri.d'ed 'D.ros;pe<ctive commenta-
tors {tor the Pitt News Style Show
was ﬁiially lifted today ‘when Cort-
land Bacall, BA-41, named Roy
Ruane, C42, and Beth l-ljmglies, C41,
co-.anno.uncers.

All women models must meet
this afternoon at 2:30 .o’clock in the
Pi‘t..t News Fbnsiiiess ofﬁce. Gene
Pyle, C41, co-chairman, states that
this .-mee'ti.ng is compulsory and any

woman who Cl’OE3S..-n0;l2 appear at the ..

xneeting will be automatically drop-
ped from the show.

Men models are .reminded to see
Fred Williams, of the men’s cloth-
ing department at Ros.eiib.a.um’s, on
the second ﬂoor between 3:30 and 6
.o’clock Tuesday or ‘Wednesday.

Because -the tasliion lovers can
-no longer look to Europe for style
trends, and are tired of everything
South American in nature, the
theme of the show is rightly called
“See America First.” It will be at
six-act fashion jpievéiexv «of spring
styles.

Rusty Williams and his college or-
tchestra  been signed to sup-
ply the melodies while the models
traipse smartly on the platform and
furnish music for the tea dancing
uwhich will follow the fashion show.
Everyone is welcome and no ad-
mission will be -charg'.ed.

IA Recognition

Biddle Claims Nature
Of Group is Political

Independent association, intro-
duced on campus two weeks ago in
a measure designed to consolidate

non-fraternity students into one
group, was given ofﬁcial recognition
with a rider attached at SFA exec-
utive committee meeting Thursday.

Voted recognition unanimously
by the committee, Independent as-
sociation was given two weeks to
produce a constitution which is
“more detailed and not so easily
amended,” according to Fred Robie,
C41, publicity director for SFA.

Chief opposition against the asso-
ciation came from Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant dean of men, who
charged that the group was politic-
al in nature, since it did not consid-
er fraternity members as eligible to
join the organization. ‘

Other business carried out at

hursday’s meeting, was the ap-
pointing of Cwens and Druids, soph-
Ol iore honorary activities fraterni-
ties to serve as ushers at Chancellor
John G. Bowman’s Charter day ad-
dress on Friday.

Meanwhile SFA transportation-
inquiry committee, under the chair-
manship of Hiram Milton, C42, met
at Carnegie Tech’s Student union
with representatives 01' other local
schools to discuss plans for their
campaign to obtain reduction of
street car rates.

A brief to be presented to the
Pittsburgh Railways company is be-
ing drawn up by the group and ac-
tion will be taken within a few
weeks, according to Milton.

Chief problem before SFA for
the i'c.maindei' of this term is the
zadoption of a satisfactorily revised
constitution, according to members
of the organization.

scctitive meetings without an ex-
cuse, l.‘»/like Sekela, M41, John

C41, were replaced. New members
are Leo Harter, C42; Steve Minno,

moved into ‘office by virtue of their
standing as a result of ias; spring’s
election.

Last Thursday, the three new

plans for a previous project.

Tentative plans of the project call
for a new course in letter writing

course would be under the supervi-
sioii of D. D. Lesseiiberry, professor

Education: The Need

For Preserving It

WE ARE pleased to learn that the WSSF
drive is not to be conducted with high pressure
methods, that it will be strictly a personal and
voluntary appeal.

VVe are glad to hear this because tber-'> has
been  criticism of this plan to aid war-
racked students. There have been many who
have said that this money could ﬁnd a much
better purpose: ﬁnancial aid to bombed Lon-
doners, French refugees, etc.

We think that in this apparent ct*'..tic:I.:m,
however, lies the most important argument in
favor of the WSSF project. After machine guns
start strafing towns and Stukas do their bomb
dropping over universities, our thoughts of re-
lief work turn toward alleviating the hunger
and the physical conditions of the victims.

But no one thought about the mental needs
and the necessity for preserving educational
processes during war conditions.
until the WSSF. I

We don’t intend to advise you where- to place
your money. We simply are asking every Pitt
man and woman to stop for a minute and think
about a heck of a lot of people your age,-. all over
the world—in concentration camps, in prisons,
in mud holes—in far more boring places than
the Tuck shop. , ' - -

To Aid 01- Not To Aid,
Is That The Problem?

AID Britain or choke.
Aid Britain an.d choke.

It is about time that this aid to Britain ques-

tion is fought out on fundamental principles.

‘Most of the people who talk about aid to
Britain don’t know what they want or don’t
want to say what they know. They don’t. think
with their emotions and their intellects; they use
only one or the other.

The most vocal opinions about backing the
British can be divided into several classes. The
all out aid to Britain boys, the aid short of war
pantywaists, and the no-aid-to-the-British-who--
led-us—over-the-same—cliff—before fellows.

The all out boys mouth genera3.i1.:i.e.s about

small nations, and enforcing lasting  They
are willing to go to war to back up these gm-
eralities. But if there is anything we Ameri-
cans have learned by pure experience. it is that
when men mouth patriotic generalities tl‘.-_e_;.r
have some not so patriotic purposes.

The short of war pantywaists believe that
we should just back up England and no more.
Give England the weapons and let them. ﬁght
our battle. They remind us of the famous song,
“Hold the fort, but we’re not coming.”

Both these prep schools of amateur propa-
gandists proclaim that they are in this battle
because they are afraid Hitler will try to blitz
the western hemisphere. Therefore the best
place to stop him is in Europe. '

I When confronted with the evidence that an
attack on the Western hemisphere is highly im-
probable to say the most, these boys shift to
speech number 2. They start asking whether
you would ratherlirve in England or Germany,
‘Whether you would rather have an English dom-
‘inated Europe or a Fascist dominated one,
"whether you would rather live in a totalitarian
world or an English imperialist one.

The answer to this speech is another ques-
tion. Who says we have only these two choices?
And there isn’t any answer worth listening to.
We do have other choices. But nobody seems
to be able to state them successfully.

Wléat these boys stress as fundamental is not
fundamental at all. It’s just good propaganda.

What is fundamental is that by aiding Britain
these fellows ﬁgure to stave off far reaching
economic and social change. With  totalitarian
Europe dominated by either Germany or Russia,
the United States would certainly have to 
come more :-;<.»cializcd than it is now, and in a
hurry. '

Thazsrre are, it is true, two divisions of the all
out aid boys: one wants to save a Tory im-
perial Engl.an_d; the other =...v:».nts to save Eng-

land for socialism and the Labor party. Some-
bodv’s got to lose. l\/laybe both.
Lindbergh doesn’t offer another choice;

Wheeler says little; Harry Elmer Barnes offers a
choice only by implication and by mentioning
Russia as an ally.

What we need is a dynamic, intelligent. emo-
tional program for staying out of war and at
the same time for advancing democracy all over
the world. And this program must include
a clear understanding of who is for the people
and who is only half for the people.

Why Basketball

Docsn’t Draw Here

Editor, the Pitt News!

In reference to Alex Z’s query on
why we students don’t—»support our
winning basketball team:

I can’t see why any but the rare
rabid basl<etball~3‘ai1 at the Univer-
:-zity should attend any of the Panth-
ers home games. Even I have
given up trying to watch our be-
loved Panthers. The two main rea-
sons for my reactions and those of
most other students are: 1)-—the
Uziivcr ity has stopped passing out
blankets to each and everyone at-
tending home games; and 2)——some
students are offended because they
don’t. get the privilege of sitting be-
hind a pillar. (Most students do,
you know.)

Swnie,: Things
2:, as
mmaammnmm“ By Al. I. Gator

Once upon a time——not so long
ago, eithcr—Tomn1y Dorsey was
complaining about the comparison
the public generally made between
his band and Benny Goodman.’s.

“We’re not a swing band,” he re-
marked on his last trip here. “Our
group just isn’t suited tor that type,
that’s all. Benny's a different type
entirely.”

Since that time, however, things
have changed. Mr. Dorse-y’s opin-
ion of his own efforts should have
changed too, for his hot sides now
are quite a contrast to the stilted
and overdone “l\/Iarie" style of a
few years back.

In order to accomplish this the
band has undergone a terriﬁc per-
sonnel change which leaves practic-
ally Dorsey himself as the sole sur-
vivo The results can best be
shown by such recent recordings as
“Swing Time,” “Up in Harlem,” and
“Swing High” (Victor 27249).

The former, in particular, is good
swing‘, speaking both musically and
from the standpoint of general pop-
ularity. Best solo is Joe Bushkin’s
piano. The latter side, you’ll find,
is far less subtle.

On the Bill cl Rights

I 2/Line!
This is Bill of Rights week, wherefore see below.
Some time ago I deplored herein the rising anti-

ﬁrearms tendency on the part of politicians and well-
mearing idiots of the Women’s Culture club type. Fun
at my expense followed. and the question was ob-
scured by numerous red herrings. I comforted myself
thusly, “The laughter of fools is half the wise man’s
reward,” and went my way.

However, I cannot stand idly by and watch my
rights, and yours, blow away like fog in a breeze be-
cause of inertia and lack of foresight. So please read
this seriously and forget past wild and woolly col-
umns written. for fun and not for literal consumption.

To Arms, New or Never

Here’s the proposition. At present in Massachu-
setts a bill is pending which demands that citizens
turn over all ﬁrearms to the police. In other states
similar bills are up for enactment, and in most east-
ern and central states such bills are either being drawn
up or being discussed. These bills are backed by cer-
tain of the more radical boys down in Washington,
guys just one jump ahead of the Dies committee.

It is unconstitutional for Federal agencies to pass
an anti—ﬁi'earms law, but each state may do as it
pleases in the matter. So the gentlemen mentioned
above have called in their ward-heelers and issued
instructions. The excuse is a ﬁfth-column scare liber-
ally dosed with anti-crime propaganda.

Beyond the Law

At first glance the stuff looks good, but only at ﬁrst.
Let us take a case in point. New York has the most
stringent gun law in the U. S., the Sullivan law, which
not only limits the purchase and carrying of a re-
volver, but outlaws a citizen keeping one in his home.
This was passed in the heyday of gangsterism and
seemed swell for awhile. But soon the police were
selling permits wholesale to gangsters, while’ an honest
citizen couldn’t get a permit for love or money, and
the gang-wars went merrily on, innocent bystanders
being shot up regularly.

This law is still in effect, but the theoretically gun-
less state just had a beautiful gun ﬁght in its main
city. Two bad boys hurrahed the town, each with
three pistols. Hunting was good, and they bagged a
few heads for their trophy room: a payroll messenger,
who should have been aimed; a cop who was armed,
but sadly innocent of the penchant of rogue males for
hide-out guns, and an unarmed taxi driver who was
an excellent example of the uselessness of courage by
itself. Since the two pranksters had no permits, they
must have broken the law, which is shocking, but,
strangely, not unique.

To balance the above, I have a friend) who once
was slated as a victim by ﬁve mal hombres while he
was carrying a payroll. Three of the gentlemen spent
time in hospitals and jails, a fourth fell off a cliff
getting away, and the last went south for his health.
You see my friend was armed, and although scratched
and burned in a few places, he had his payroll, he was
not dead, and he had prevented those bad bold men
from having murder on their consciences, if any.

Write Your Senators

“The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed,” says our Bill of Rights. This
our founding fathers considered essential for the
preservation of “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness.” Once we take a brick from this wall the
whole structure will begin to crumble. If you do not
believe me, ask any pre-law student about the im-
portance of precedent in such matters. The first step
is the important one. Also, never give up what you
already have, if you can help it. You never can tell
when you’ll need it.

I feel about this very strongly. So strongly that I
will pay postage on all letters to our state and U. S.
Senators deploring such legislation, which you may
bring up to the News office (eighth ﬂoor, Cathedral)
and leave for me to mail. And I hope I go broke buy-
ing stamps. I have tried to present the case soberly
and as completely as space will allow, and I hope
action will follow. That’s all. Don’t say I didn’t tell
you.

wasn’t afraid of contaminating the sewage
system. I must admit that you are a
very clever fellow. Your trick of putting
an ad in the News begging for dates and
signing with a. girl’s phone number was
very clever. If the girl cried about it.
that wasn’l your fault. Your first ad
“exposing” me was clever too, except
that it, like the other ad, did not carry
your signature. It might interest you to
know that there is no one in the Univer-
sity who has ever read the Criterion col-

has never been signed all the years the
magazine has carried it. I must also
commend your fine powers of observa-

being weak and ugly, I am also honest.
And anything I said about your actions is
the least any honest man could say.

Triumphant Panthers
Swamp Geneva, 55-41

Straloski Stars as Senior

Quintet

Reaches Se-.ason’s Peak in Finale

.y By" ART REINSTEIN

‘Five Pitt seniors reached the end of a long, hard climb toward
basketball greatness l<‘1'i(lay.i11gl1t as they put on a dazzling passing
exhibition to swamp Geneva, 55--ll, lll their last appearance on the

Stadium court.

Every man on the team got a great‘ hand from the fans when he

lei.’t‘t.lie game in the final quarter.
Panthers mixed great passing, nifty
shooting, plenty of ﬁght, and ﬁne
teamwork into a brew that was far
‘...oo‘str'o'ng for Geneva.

Eddie Straloski was at the peak
of his game as he led the Pitt attack
with‘3'0 points. Though Stro’s tri-
umphant ﬁnal appearance was
slightl'y shadowed by the 24 point
scoring spree of Geneva’s Dick Hart,

Phi K11 p pas Try‘

For Comeback
gC1IinstS.—4E’s

Phi Kappa will hit the comeback
‘trail tomorrow night when they
battle the ever dangerous SAE quin-
tet  ‘the Trees gym ﬂoor.

Last year’s championship team
wasfp'ot_entially a great combination
in’.‘éai‘ly'season tilts, but has since
slumped tremendously. Their only
loss was to the present leaders of
the I-1?‘ basketball race, Sigma Al-
pha-.l\/Iu.

Their game last week was typical
of the Phi Kap attack as they
swarnped their opponents, but the
long lay off from mid-semester va-
vation hurt their timing and a-ccur-
acy.

Captain Jack Glenn should again
be the spearhead of the Phi Kap at-
tack for, thus far during the sea-
son, his shooting and passing have
been a marvel of the fraternity cir-
cruit.

The game should be close, with
the SAE team liable to pull an up-
set. The contest will start at 7
o’clock.

Sigma Alpha Mu takes on a fast
fading Lambda Chi team at 8
o’clock. The Sammies need every
victory they can take, for the sec-
ondrplace Phi Kaps and Phi Gams
are only one game behind.

Striving to keep abreast of the
Phi Kaps in their perch in second
place, the Fijis will try to knock the
Kappa Sigma team completely out
of the runnng tomorrow night at 8
o’clock on the Stadium ﬂoor.

Earl Pressel, Al Holbrook, Mike
Mitchell, Bobby Thurbon, and Bob
Quick make up the starting combin-
ation that has been playing havoc
with all contenders.

And ever_\' man deserved it. The

the old master added a swell assort-
ment of passing and dribbling tricks
to his shooting achievements to
prove himself the best man on the
ﬂoor.

Only sour note of the evening, be-
sides those pumped out by a bugler
in the stands, was Georgie Koch-
eran’s twisted ankle. Koch col-
lided with Jimmy Klein under the
hoop, a moment later came in fast
for a shot, missed, and staggered
into the arms of an oﬁicial. Koch
had to be carried from the floor by
his teammates, but should be ready
for Saturday’s game at Penn State.

The Panther senior ﬁve did
everything right in a fast ﬁrst quar-
ter which set them up to a 15-8
lead. After Covenanter dark horse
Dick Hart had dropped in a long
are, the first of his seven successful
'l‘«=3:‘vr.-.3 in eight tries, Straloski, Mel
.T’<~rt, and Jimmy Klein found them-
.~'I.‘.lveS on the scoring ends of slick
"‘R.\"~'=itlg plays to roll in 10 points
be"-ire Geneva could add another
tally. _

Though they slowed up quite a
bit in the second quarter, the Pan-
thers were helped along by a sloppy
exhibition by Geneva. Straloski
scored six points in this period, four
of them on fouls and little ball-
ha‘.v3.«: Kocheran got inside twice to
ring up ﬂelders and added a foul to
biiing the Panther half-time score
to 26 against Geneva’s 16.

Neither John Billie nor Danny
Vis€:ia1‘elli lived up to his press
clippings. In the first half “Vish”
didn’t score a point; Billie scored
four but looked terrible doing it.

ﬁrst for the entire squad. Inﬁeld-
ers and outﬁelders as well as bat-
tery men, will be given preliminary
workouts.

According to reports, none of last
season’s regulars will be ineligible
for competition this season. How-
ever, later checkups may change
this situation.

Among the athletes expected to
be present when Coach Mitterling
holds session this afternoon will be
a number of veterans from the
1940 squad. Included in this list
will be inﬁelders Katz, Vaiksnor,
Holbrook, Guadagnino, Bush, Goelz,
and Jones.

A host of newcomers to the Pitt
baseball team is expected. First-
baseman Lefty iBrown anotcatcher
Art Bariska, both of whom sﬂowed
plenty of promise in fall practice,
are expected to be given the most
attention.

The Panthers will probably drill
primarily on simple loosening-up
exercises at today’s meeting. Later,
they are expected to be put through
a thorough sliding drill.

Candidates for the team are asked
to take care of their eligibility status
at the earliest possible moment, so
that equipment can be given out.
Blanks for this purpose may be ob-
tained irom Ken George at the Sta-
dium.

Wolevcrinlo Tmwlcsters

 

Although Pittsburgh men took six
out of 12 first places, Michigan’s
better balanced track squad show-
ed the form that has made them
‘Vestern conference champions, in.
ieating the Panthers, 64-40, Fri-
day night at Ann Arbor.

With the Wolverines’ Wisner,
Purdue, and Leake sweeping three
places in the mile run, Michigan
took a head start and the Pan-
thers never caught up. It was am-
ple revenge for the upset trimming
handed the Wolverines by Pitt last
spring. _

Having taken a survey of opinion
on the merits of the woman athlete,
I ﬁnd that she is considered by
most “broad” minded men as a
pretty sad story. Even the mention
of a sports loving lovely brings a
shudder to the wide shoulders of
our typical undergraduate male.
She is a specimen of a group that
one can take or leave alone. The
latter being the case, usually.

Then . . . ﬂash a picture of love-
ly Eleanor Holm Jarrett Rose, etc.,
the Olympic champion swimmer!
Well, there’s a different story. She’s
one in a million, the men say. Not
a bit masculine. I’ll say she isn’t;
and neither are hundreds of other
women athletes.

Ocritical? Why Not?

Alice Marble, tennis star of long
standing, is considered a truly beau-
tiful woman, even by the most crit-
ical of men. And believe me, most
men are plenty critical! Five will
get you ten that most of the shouts
and whistles of approval upon Miss
Marble’s completion of a successful
game are not merely for her un-
beaten tennis techniques.

Shall I go on? In the golf world

Betty Jameson, the little

southern champion, is certainly not
one to be passed up in a crowd. And
her golf game is one of the ﬁnest,
too.

Should I mention the basketball
cuties? I shouldn’t? O. K..

But what could be more delight-
ful than to gaze on a feminine arch-
er (I mean the sport, archery) with
head thrown back, hair rippling
around her ears, the skirts ﬂowing
gently in the breeze, aiming and
hitting the bull’s-eye with a true,
swift arrow. Compare this picture
with one of a competent male,
standing with legs astride, shirt
tails dangling, perspiration dripping
from his brow, eyes squinting in
the glare of the sun; and, oh yes, he
needs a shave. He gently pulls back
the string and, ping, bull’s-eye.
What different pictures with prac-
tically identical results.

OVVho’s Jealous?

I seem to bestraying a bit from
my original complaint. You gallant
young men who delight in deriding
the woman athlete are really the
sad creatures. And it’s easily ex-
plained. You’re jealous!

You can never even hope to make

The Women Take Over
With Rather Amazing Results
By Harriet Harris

the delightful picture when partici-
pating in your favorite pastime that
most women make without the
slighest effort. So what do you do?
You belittle and dismiss all woman
athletes as females trying their
hardest to imitate the men, trying,
as you put it, to overcome their
handicap.

Well, those women athletes are
laughing at you, see, just as l’m
laughing at you! We’re wise to you,
kid!

Sammies Take Badminton. Title;

Phi Eps Win Paddle Tennis

Phi Epsilon Pi and Sigma Alpha Mu, underdogs in I-F competition,
came through in surprisingly good fashion last week to win the paddle

tennis and badminton trophies.

In paddle tennis the race was the keenest, for the championship Phi

Ep team only won by the scant margin of two games.

The Phi Delt

duet of Ferris and Black pushed the victors to the limit, but lost out

only in their ﬁnal contest.

Jimmy Deutlebaum and Wally Hirsch made up the pair that upset

the “sure winners.”
Delta Tau Delta and Phi Gamma
Delta fighting it out. But in the
ﬁnal tilt, the Fijis lost ground, and
were nosed out by the Delts.

The Delt combination amassed a
total of 27 wins against six defeats.
The fourth place Fijis won 26 games
and lost seven.

Sigma Alpha Mu made a runaway
race of it in the badminton league
with their closest competitors six
games behind. The Sammies lost
two of their games to the second
place Phi Kaps, and one to the Phi
Eps. .

Sapolski and Nemrod composed
the winning team. The Phi Kaps,
with a record of 27 victories and

nine defeats, were completely out ’

ofthe running for first place, but
showed superior form over the sec-
ond division contestants.

The Phi Ep team of Briskin and
Cuden did not show all that was
expected of them, but did do enough
to cop a third place post. Phi Ep-
silon Pi won 25 matches and lost 11.

The most interesting note of these
two minor sports is that the all-
intramural leaders, Phi Gamma
Delta and DeltaiTau Delta, did not
win a first or second place trophy.

I :2 Prevention of ‘War Nerves’ With Experiment

Is it possible that “war nerves”
can be in part prevented with a Vi-
tamin-rich diet? Could the soldier
who “cracks up" under artillery ﬁre
and dive bombing be partially pro-
te:-ted from shock by special food‘?

These and other questions vital
in national defense preparations are
naturally suggested by a discovery
announced today by University sci-
entists.

Noise vs. Vitamins

Dr. H. ‘W. Karn, instructor in
:syc'nr..logy, and R. A. Patton, re-
search fellow in psychology, have
"ound, while experimenting with
hundreds of albino rats, that some
of the rats barely blink an eye
when a loud buzzer is sounded, but
that other rats—hearing exactly the

There would be nothing remark-
able about that—if it weren’t that
the shock-proof rats were eating
food containing lots of. Vi-taiimin B-1,
whereas the rats “knocked cold” by
the buzzer’s noise were fed a diet
only moderately deficient in that
nutrient.

University Enlarges Supply "\.._
Of Current Events Literature

University libraries are speeding-
up preparations to satisfy the in-
creasing demands for books on cur-
rent events by foreign affairs ﬁends.

The trend toward reading books
about world problems ias brought
many requests for new volumes,
which are now available to Univer-
sity students and faculty members
in the Alldred room.

Among the new books is Norman
Ange1l’s“‘America‘s Dilemma, Alone
or Allied?” in which the author
sets forth his conception of the
policy the United States should en-
force concerning the present con-
flict.

Another‘ significant book is “Jug-

gernaut Over Holland” by Van
Kleﬁens, who tells the story of the
Ger_man invasion of the Lowlands
in the ‘spring’ of 1940.

“Where Do VVe Go i'l‘€)Y'n Here?”
by Harold Laskil Di‘ofessor of po-
litical science at the University of
London; ilfesents the _‘writer’s views
on the fundamental causes of‘ the
present struggle, and on the type of
society he feels must emerge if
Great Britain is victorious. ‘

The “Living Thoughts Library”
is the name of a new set of volumes
being added to the collection in the
Alldred room. Each volume con-
tains selections from the writings of
each great thinker of the world.

Four Seniors Eligihl.e for Special Marine Corps
Course to Be Offered Duiring Summer Months

Four University seniors, non-
ROTC men, will be eligible after
graduation for admission into the
Marine. corps’ special training course
for reserve officers, to begin in July.

Created to meet the demands or
the corps during the limited nation-
a1 emergency, the special course will
provide officers in a much shorter
period of time than previously.

To be eligible the applicant must

quirements:

1. Must be a graduate of a na-
tionally or regionally accredited
college or university having a full
four-year course. Medical, dental,
and theological graduates will not

2. Must be a native born male
citizen of the United States.

3. Must be unmarried between
the years of 20 and 25.

4. Must pass a physical examin-
ation required for second lieuten-
ants of’ the regular service.

5. Must not be a member of the

not conflict with the plans for the
utilization of his service by the Vtrar
department.

6. Must be recommended as to
character and qualiﬁcations by the
president or clean of the institution
froin which he graduated, by one
member of the iaculty, and by at
least three citizens of good stand-
ing in the candidate’s home com-
munity.

Accepted candidates will be given
a complete physical examination
and if qualified transferred by com-
mercial transportation to the Ma-
rine barracks, Quantico, Va., where
they will be placed in a platoon
leader’s class for three months.

Those candidates who complete
the three—month basic course and
are recommended for further train-
ing will be commissioned as second-
lieutenants in the Marine corps re-
serve and assigned to a Reserve of‘-
ii_cer’s course for three months.

To be eligible for the commission

of $183. ,

Those officers who successfully

and who are required for the needs
0 the naval service will be assigned
to duty with troops for the duration
of the emergency.

Officers will be given an oppor-

tunity to_ request specific assign-
ments.
Reserve of‘ficers who make o‘-.1‘?.-

standing records may have the op-
portunity for appointment as offi-
cers in the regular service.

Prior to the new arrangement
the university was alloted one or
more commissions in the regular
tnarine corps to honor ROTC grad-
uates. Now these cannot be ar-
"anged.

By this new set—up_. regular ma-
rine corps c~.fl’i(;ers will be selected
from the new reserve officers.

Applications and information are
available at the military depart-
mt-nt and an officer of the marine

panied by lecture-demonstrations
by Mr. Patton.

Karn and Patton haven’t car-

to say that vitamins provide a de-
fcnse against shel1—shock in hu-
mans. But they will admit that:

al animals have even a reasonably
close bearing upon human physiol-
gy, it is clear that a new approach
has been provided for the study of
performance under severe condi-
tions of noise exposure in industry
and in military service of such type
as the tank corps, aviation, artillery
fire. and sustained bomb attacks.”

The work was carried on under
research gants by the Buhl founda-
tion and the Willams-Waterman

,fund of New York.

For long, experimental psychol-
such behavior
“purely mental,” blaming it on men-
tal conflict or confusion. When
Karn and Patton first found nutri-
tion a factor in the rats’ behavior,
they took their problem to Dr.
Charles Glenn King, discoverer of
Vitamin C and director of Buhl
fou_ndation-supported research at
Pitt.

Nutrition Affects Nerves

Under his direction the experi-
ments have been carried on since
then-—and blame for the rats’~nerv-
ousness has been squarely put on
speciﬁc ingredients in their diets.

The easily-shocked rats aren’t
starving, the Pitt research men
warn, explaining:

“Their diets are almost normal.
The rats grow normally, and they
are capable of reproduction. They
look healthy.

“It should be remembered that
they never become accustomed to
the buzzer’s noise. No matter how
many times they are ‘knocked
cold’ by it, they continue to react
to it. We cannot blame this thing
on surprise. It is a matter of fund-
amentally _ bad diet, and the only
way to correct it is to correct the
diet.”

lslarn and Patton say that scien-
tists have long recognized vitainin
de.‘lciency as a factor in poor nerv-
ous stability; the present work is
striking in that the deﬁciencies are
not evident inte1‘ms of general be-
havior or appearance.

Their‘ experiments, , however,
show that mental upsets may be
prompted by a vitamin deﬁciency so
slight that it could easily be over-
looked in planning food for combat
troops.

not designated, not less than 50 per
cent will be allocated to China; of
the funds allocated to Europe, a
part may be appropriated to meet
the needs of refugee students in the
United States, Paul Spray, C42,. city-
wide chairman, declared.

Sponsored by the International
Student service and the National In-
tercollegiate Christian council,
WSSF is asking $100,000 net from
American students. Campaigns
have been conducted on over 500
campuses already and students at
Smith college have donated $7,000.
Amherst, Harvard, and other east-
ern colleges are among the contribu-
tors. ’

“The need is great,” explained
Dr. Homer P. Rainey, national
chairman, “as the fund exists to
help students who are suffering be-
cause of war; it helps to provide for
future educated leadership in Asia
and Europe and to maintain the
good will which exists between
American students and those in for-
eign countries.”

Chesterfield is fully ripe and mild to

are conditioned, the long period of
ageing and the way Chesterfield blends
them, all help to make them for milder.
