Internships

The Center for Latin Ameri-
can Studies will award 12
undergraduate scholarships
(worth approximately $1,000)
for research in the Dominican
Republic. The award covers
most of the cost of round-trip
and in-country travel as well as
seven and a half weeks room
and board.

Candidates who are selected
for the program will take part
in an interdisciplinary seminar
during the Winter term, in

0 preparation for the field trip to
the Dominican Republic dur-
ing the Spring session. During
the seminar, participants will
examine the history, geog-
raphy, literature and social
structure of the region they will
be visiting and will design indi-
vidual research projects. In

dents will have the opportunity
to undertake intensive study of
Spanish, if necessary, during
’ the term.

Nine credits may be earned

for the successful completion of

.> the seminar and field trip; the

credits are applied toward the
Certification in Latin Ameri-
can Studies and have generally
been accepted for academic
credit in the students’ major
departments. -

The recipients will pay only
$375 plus tuition for the Spring

the field trips and further
details about the winter prepar-
atory seminar on the Domini-
can Republic are available at
the center, 4E04 Forbes Quad-
rangle, extension 5563. The
application deadline is Oct. 15,
1982, interview appointments
should be made upon submis-
sion of application.

Security
System
Protested

_By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

A small committee of the Resi-
dent Student Association has been
formed to protest the continuation
of a pilot project to enforce security
in the Pitt dormitories.

The Committee to Remove the
Access Card Reader System, led by
Susan Dalzell and Lisa McGrosky,
said that the system has defeated its
own purpose and has been a major
inconvenience for dorm residents.

The “black boxes” were first
used a few weeks ago to provide
automatic access to the dormitories
in the Schenley quadrangle. The
system requires each resident to
insert his student ID into the card
reader, which verifies, based on the
coding of the ID, that the studentis
a “legitimate” resident of that
building. ‘

After the machine verifies the
student’s residency, the desk
attendant will buzz him into the
building.

Some of the main objections to
this system raised by the committee
are that back-ups occur during the
peak traffic hours (around lunch
and dinner) and. that, since a desk
attendant must be present to buzz
people in, the system is
unnecessary.

Dalzell claims the “black boxes”
in Holland Hall have been broken
at least 50 percent of the time, they
reject temporary ID cards held by
some residents and often jam the
doors.

“It hasn’t proven effective in
anything,” Dalzell said. '

Consumer Crusader To Speak  

By RAY WUSLICH

Consumer crusader Ralph
Nader will speak at Pitt’s David
Lawrence Hall Thursday at 8 p.m.
on the subject of consumerism and
law in the ’80s. ,

Sponsorship for the event is
being shared by four campus
groups--the Student Government
Legal Awareness Committee, the

Pitt Program Council, the Pre-
Law Society and University Career
Seminar Series and has been timed
to coincide with Law Week.

The decision to bring Ralph
Nader was made jointly by the
sporsoring groups, the contract
was negotiated by the Legal Aware-
ness Committee.

“They were looking for a partic-
ular type of person to fit the theme

..

of Law ‘Week," said Joyce Gian-
garlo, adviser of the committee.
Nader’s consumer advocacy has
virtually made him a household
name since the mid-1960s. His
book, “Unsafe at Any Speed,” in
which he accused the auto industry
of putting profits before safety, was
a best seller and his first major
attack on big business. Nader has
been on the offensive ever since.

Like many other industries
and businesses suffering the
effects of a sluggish economy,
the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) isn’t having an easy
time financially.

The organization, which
represents about 10,000 pot-
smoking Americans, is losing
large contributors and finding
it harder than ever to raise

money. NORML was even pre-

NORML’s

vented from publishing recent
leaflets, issued quarterly,.
because of its financial crunch,
according, to it’s National
Director George Farnham.
NORML’s strongest finan-
cial contributor has been the
Playboy Foundations, but the
$20,000 the foundation usually
contributes has been cut to
$5,000, Farnham said. He said
in the future NORML would
like to focus on a broad base
membership rather thgn rely on

a few large contributions.

Financial problems aren't the
only thing plaguing NORML.
Eighteen months ago, member-
ship was at a low of 6,000.
(There are an estimated 30 mil-
lion pot-smokers in the United
States.)

Farnham blamed this low on
the New Reagan Administra-
tion policies and budget cut-
backs. He said membership this
year has increased because peo-
ple are inclined to fight Reagan
policies.

In 1966, he won a law suit of
$425,000 against General Motors
over that company’s invasion of his
privacy. He later used the money to
start a consumer protection
movement.

Under the umbrella—tax-exempt
organization, Public Citizen, exist
a number of groups such as Con-
gress Watch, the Health Research
Group, the Tax Reform Research
Group, the Aviation Consumer
Action Project and the Public Citi-
zen Litigation Group.

Through these groups, Nader _

has been the main driving force in
the enactment of a number of con-
sumer protection laws. The
National Traffic and Safety Act,
the Comprehensive Occupational
Safety Act, the Radiation Control
for Heath and Safety Act are just a
few of the laws for which he has
lobbied.

Nader does not own a car, lives in
a one-bedroom flat in Washington,
D.C., buys his suits off the rack and
won’t fly into airports near nuclear
power stations.

He grew up in Winstead, Conn.,
the son of Lebanese immigrants.
He graduated from Princeton Uni-
versity in l955 and received his
degree in law from Harvard in
1958.

She also expressed concern in the
possibility of a computer record of
the time residents enter the
building.

Donovan Hughes, director of
housing and food services, said it
was “naive” to believe that the uni-
versity would be concerned with
the times students enter the dorms.
He also said the machinery is not
sophisticated enough to perform
such a duty.

“There is no attempt to monitor
who goes in and who goes out,”
Hughes said.

While the university is using the
system on a free trial basis, the cost
to buy one machine would be more
than $500. This does not include
maintenance, according to
Hughes.

If the decision is made to use the
system in all dormitories, a desk
attendant will still be on full-time
duty as “the best possible proof” of
residency, he said.

John Baron, a desk attendant,
agrees that the “black bloxes”
would be effective “as a back-up
system” to visual recognition of
residents. He has found no prob-
lem with a back-up of residents in
the lobby and says that the system
has even been helpful in some
ways.

“In Amos, it helps me learn who
lives here and who doesn't,” he
said, adding that “it makes people
carry ID who usually don't."

The effort to get rid of the system
has been concentrated in Holland
Hall, where a petition will be
passed door-to-door on each floor
by the RSA floor representative,
protesting the continuation of the
use of the boxes.

McCormick Hall, however, is
becoming involved in the actions,
and representatives from McCor-
mick are scheduled to meet with
people from the housing office
soon.

“What we’re trying to do is make
this a total quad effort,” Dalzell
said".

The housing office plans to uti-
lize the system for about a year to
get students’ reaction to it, reports
from desk attendents and to see if
the security of the buildings has
improved.

“We’re not trying to force any-
thing down the students’ throats,”
Hughes said.

In the meantime, Dalzell does
not see the system’s future as
bright.

“I'm sure in theory it was a good
idea,” she said, “but in practice it is
not applicable to the dorm situa-
tion we have here.”

Schenley Renovation
inconvenience Continues

Pitt students will be further
inconvenienced as the renovation
of Schenley Hall moves into its
final phase beginning in early
November.

Director of Student Activities
Andy Smith said at yesterday’s Stu-
dent Affairs Advisor Council
(SAAC) meeting that students will
have to be patient while the main
floor of the student union 18 being
torn up.

Smith told the council, which is
made up of various student leaders
and university administrators, that
all the offices currently located on.
the first floor, except the placement
office, will be moved to anot-her
part of the building.

For  

There will not be any heat on the
main floor until the renovations
are completely finished in the fall
of 1983.

Smith also announced that the
furniture for floors 3-7 will begin
to arrive on Nov. 9-Nov. 15. He said
60-65 percent of the furniture for
the “student” floors will be deli-
vered at that time.

The upper floors, which house
most of the student groups, are bas-
ically completed, Smith said, but
getting to those floors will also be a
hassle in the near future.

Starting on Oct. 15 or Nov. 1,
depending on the progress, the ele-
vators will begin to shut off for
refurbishing. One elevator at a

five week period to be rewired and
painted.

The one elevator that is working
will be used to move the furniture .
that will be delivered in mid-
November. Smith said his office
will try to keep the freight elevator
open during this time for the mov-
ers’ use.

Smith predicted that by the
beginning of next fall term, the
“grand opening" of the new stu-
dent union will beheld and gave a
“real” estimate of everything being
fully equipped.

“We had a hotel we were using as

 A Different Career

«W

By JULIE HORN

Jon Hanson used to be in a rock-
n-roll band but is now “playing a
new instrument.”

Hanson, a laser artist for Laser
Images Inc., travels from city to city
performing in planetariums and
observatories, in Los Angelos,
Seattle and Pittsburgh. He is now
working at the Buhl Planetarium.

A traveling laser artist fixes,
moves and maintains all the equip-
ment besides performing shows,
Hanson said. He now does about
tenshows daily.

“I don’t design actual choreo-
graphy; it’s more like somebody
writing a score for a song and say-
ing, ‘play it your style,’ he said.

Hanson said one laser choreo-
grapher designs a show and each
laser artist does it differently.

Laser shows “look like stars
against the night and an hour show
seems like fifteen minutes,” he
said.

Laserlmages Inc. has done spe- ~
cial effects for commercials and .

movies, and according to Hanson,
some new developments in lasers
are grocery price readers and laser-
erasers, which dissolve ink off
paper.

Hansen said he believes someday
“everyone will have his own
lasers.”

Hanson, who has been giving

laser shows for five years, attended

Perhaps most noted for his cam-
paign against the Ford Motor
Company over the unsafe gas tank
design of the Pinto, Nader’s more
recent. concerns include energy
monopolies, nuclear‘ power and
the credibility of standardized edu-
cational tests like the SAT.

Nader has been consistently
well~received at other colleges and

universities around the country

and is noted for his willingness to
stay until the last question has been
answered. He typically meets about
one hundred speaking engage-
ments a year.

In true Nader style, he will
arrive, as his contract stipulates,
“in a mid-size American car with
shoulder harnesses and a responsi-
ble driver.”

Kurt Binkley, chairman of the
Legal Awareness Committee,
expects Nader "to be well received.
“He is a somewhat controversial
figure with things to say that apply
to us here and now.”

Nader will receive $3,500 for his
appearance, $3,000 of this will be
covered by the Legal Awareness
Committee. The other $500 and
expenses will be paid by PPC.

the University of Washington for a
couple of years for engineering,
until he saw an ad for a laser artist.

“Lasers are more artistic, which
you can’t really learn in school,” he
said.

Hanson was one of many repre-
sentatives at yesterday’s sector of
the Career Seminar being held in
Forbes Quadrangle.

The seminar coordinated by stu-
dents Kathleen Hoy, Ana Almen-
darez and Linda Cohen, is designed
for students to get information and
advice on their career interests.

A different topic is set for each

day this week, where professionals
will set up booths and talk to inter-
ested students.
The coordinators said so far there
has been good attendance but
director of advising Fred Koloc said
“I’m always surprised more stu-
dents don’t participate.

Monday’s career topics included
health, education and social servi-
cess. They were represented by over
fifty tables.

Yesterday’s agenda was based on
business, indu'stry and communi-
cation and an employers’ Fair for
liberal arts candidates is scheduled
for Wednesday. Thursday will
focus on government and law with
representatives for over sixty law
schools. V

The seminar will conclude on
Thursday night with a lecture from
Ralph Nader on “Consumerism
and Law for the l980’s”.

The group’s constituency is
also changing. Rolling Stone
magazine recently published an
article on why the ‘60’s genera-
tion isn’t smoking pot
anymore.

Farnham disagreed with this
article, “people smoke pot less
as they grow older, but overall
they st-i-ll smoke occassionally.”

';He said the average age pot-
smoker is 28, and NORML
focuses their efforts on the age
group 18-35. “This age group

has increased in the last five
years,” he said.

_ The major difficulties
NORML faces among pot-
smokers is a lack of awareness
about marijuana laws, Fam-
ham said.

NORML is starting a Direct
Mailing Prospect Program and
will send out 40,000 leaflets
explaining the group’s purpose
to attract more members, Farn-
ham said.

In addition to its consti-

has changed in the last few
years. Decriminalization is still
a major issue, Farnham said,
but NORML is now also advo-
cating taxed marijuana distri-
bution legislation.

“By the end of the l980’s
marijuana will be a system of
regulated, taxed distribution,
and will.probably be sold like
alcohol, over the counter with
age restrictions,” Farnham
said.

In a" recent NORML poll‘,

93.4 of those who responded .

favored this type of marijuana
distribution, Farnham said.__ __

NORML is now lobbying "I

to remove penalties for posses-
sion of small amounts of mari-
juana. The group also filed two
lawsuits last summer against
Florida's use of the herbicide
paraquat to contaminate mari-
juana plants.

The American Tradition of Voting

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

Eligible voters in the Ameri-
can population have an apa-
thetic view of using their rights
at the ballot box, particularly
the younger people of voting
age. This fact has been pointed
out every year at election time,
and each year, it becomes more
evident.

Dwight Eisenhower said,
“Politics should be the part-
time profession of every citi-
zen.” The voting record of
America would show that it is
not even a part-time hobby.

According to the United
States census bureau, only 71
percent of all the people eligi-
ble to register for the vote did so
in 1980. The total percentage of
eligible people who voted in
1980 was only 52.9 percent.
This statistic is remarkable;
1980 was a presidential election
year.

The percentage of eligible

voters who actually vote has.

been decreasing over the past 10
years to the current low rate. It’s
possible that by the year 1984
this country may be electing its
president by a vote of fewer
than half of the eligible people.

What has led to this decline?
Many answers to this question
have been given: lack of confi-
dence in politicians, apathetic
views of the issues and feelings
that nothing will be able to
undo what has already been
done.

Experts in political science
offer many more answers. But
instead of interviewing these
experts, why not listen directly
to some of the people who have
decided not‘ to vote in the
upcoming elections? They are
the people who could give bet-
ter insights into the problem.

Two students answered the
question, “Why didn't you reg-

 

ister for this year’s election?’ _r‘
They are not meant to represent

the university or the age group

to which they belong, and the

names given are not their rea
names.

Eighteen-year-old freshman,-N

John, gave an answer that i

typical of many in all age:

brackets.

“I just forgot about it,” he

said. “I don’t know, it jus
seems like I have a lot of other
things to do. It's not that I’m
copping out on it or anything

it’s just that I didn’t

remember.” .

John explained that being a
freshman required him to do
research about the college he
wanted to attend, which took a
large amount of his time. He
also said that his orientation to
the university had distracted
him from doing other things.

“I didn't realize the amount
of work that I would be doing,
so I had to give up a lot ofother

things. I used toywatch more
TV than I do now—-and more
stereo listening. I can't do
everything. ”

John is in the majority in his
age group by not registering

this statistic has also been on

the decline. There is little hope
for the improvement of the
situation for this election year.
With the continuing drop in
the number of younger people

and voting. In 1980, only 35.7
percent of people in the 18-20
year-old category reported that
they voted. The 21-24 year-olds
showed a slightly better record
with 43.1 percent. voting in
1980.

Like the national average,

voting, it can be estimated that
in the coming years (assuming
that the situation doesn’t
improve) only a third of these
eligible voters will be going to
the ballot box.

A 20-year-old Pitt student,
Susan, provided another reason
why people decide not to vote.

Page 4

The Pitt News, Wednesday October 6, 1982

“I just don’t believe that it
does any good. The politicians
are going to do what they’re
going to do. They just don’t
care. I mean that. Just look at
what they’re doing about the
umemployment that's in this
country. It just doesn’t matter
to them.”

To a large extent, Susan’s
views are shared throughout
the country. This is the feeling
that no matter what is done at
the voting box, it will have lit-
tle, if any, effect on the issues.
This attitude is supported by
statistics of voting records in a
non-presidential voting year.
In 1978 for example, only 35.5

. percent of the voting popula-

tion voted for their United
States representatives for,Con-
gress. The outlook for improve-
ment is not good.

Susan put forward a good

\ argument regarding the unem-
1
ployed. The present unemploy-

ment levels are at their highest
point since World War II. This
Friday, the government is sup-
posed to announce the new
unemployment statistics for
September. This is significant
in three ways.

First, it is predicted that the
new statistics will reach the
double digit level. If this is true,
it will be a post-war high that
will reflect on the present
administration’s economic
policies.

Second, the statistics will be
the last ones received by the
public before the November
elections. If they show increas-
ing unemployment, they could
significantly "harm the GOP’s
election status.

Third, and perhaps most
interesting, the umemployed
have significantly lower voter
participation than those who
are employed.

In the 1980 elections, only
41.2 percent of the unemployed
took part in the election, but
61.8 percent of the employed
voted. The history of recent
elections reveals that the unem-
ployed lag behind the working
population in voting by 16 to
18 percentage points. So, in the
upcoming election, the country
may see an all-time low in voter
turnout and this may be attrib-
uted, at least in part, to the high
unemployment rate.

The response to this year’s
election has drawn criticisms
from nonvoters on the campus
who say that they are apprehen-
sive about the candidates who
are running for office. Some say
that none of the candidates
offer what they are looking for,
and, as a result, they are relieved
that they aren’t voting. One stu-
dent may have summed up the
underlying problem of the
younger generation’s not vot-
ing when he said, “I don’t

The nuclear freeze movement is
attracting more than grass roots
support, and that support could
provide the momentum needed for
a move towards disarmament
according to Tim Barner, executive
director of the World Federalists
Association of Pittsburgh.

Barner spoke to the Arms Race

program examining issues such as
nuclear war and related concerns.

“The freeze campaign is sweep-

of the reason he gave for this is that
the freeze proposal has broad
appeal and does not require people
to engage in any high-technology

initiatives relative to world
security.

One such proposal is Resolution
392 which is important according
to Barner not simply because it has
the support of _l3vcongressmen, but
because itgoes beyond the idea of a
nuclear -A "freeze to that of
disarmament.

The resolution states that Con-
gress would welcome an interna-
tional agreement
provide for the common security of
all nations through the disarma-
ment of all nations until “non-
threatening force levels are
reached” and that an international
security and disarmament author-
ity should be established to oversee
this disarmament process.

“The fact that it uses the word
‘disarmament’ in itself is signifi-
cant,” Barner said. Section 4 of the
resolution which involves the pres-
ident and requests that he report on
the steps he has taken and the
responses he has received from the
international community is
another important feature of the
resolution according to Barner.

The Federalists are going to use
this resolution as an educational
tool and go around to local con-
gressmen to determine their feel-
ings about it Barner said.

The movement is receiving a lot
of input Barner said. He said that
this is evidenced by the number of
states that will be voting this fall on
the question of the freeze. He said
that an estimated 26 percent of the
electorate will be voting “yes” or
“no” on the freeze.

sure candidates. Barner said that
political action committees (PAC)
are forming around the issue of
peace.

Barner said that he is aware of
opposing arguments but that he
prefers the following answers

.offered by writer Leslie Gelb.

The argument of Soviet super-
iority is not true according to Gelb
who cites the war in Lebanon and
the poor weapons capacity of the
Syrians as an example of this. Gelb
also argues that it is contradictory
for the United States to say how
weak it is and at the same time con-
vince its allies that it is strong
enough to defend them.

Another argument-—that the
Soviets will cheat—is weaker
according to Gelb, considering
that the U.S. has the capacity to
find out about weapons testing and
deployment in the Soviet Union.

One problem for the disarma-
ment movement is that the word
itself has gotten a bad name Barner
said after the lecture. The chal-
lenge is to find words that sound as
safe as “international security”
according to Barner.

The press is another matter.

“The media, to some extent,
reflects the public demand,”
Barner said. “As an increasing
number of people talk about the
issue, it may become viable, and it
might leak into the Press Club or

people in the press might risk talk- 0

ing about it more,” Barner said.

Barner said that he does not con-
sider himself or the idea idealistic,
adding that only the political and
human will is lacking——the idea is
workable.

Mere P. R.  

The geography department situation, besides‘ being
illuminating on a number of other points, brings to mind
the attention (or lack of it) given to faculty committees
appointed to review administrative decisions.

Specifically, we’re wondering whether the purpose of
such committees is to go through the motions of looking
at a decision that’s already been made, or to actually evalu-
ate such a decision and answer the hard questions of why it
is being done.

In geography’s case, four Faculty of Arts and Sciences
committees came to the conclusion that the department»
‘should not be terminated. All four recommendations were
subsequently ignored by FAS dean Jerome Rosenberg. A
fifth committe of the university senate took tip the issue
after Rosenberg had again recommended terminating the
department and that comittee also ruled in favor of the
geography department.

The final decision on the matter is left up to the provost
and the chancellor and judging from the past, there
appears to be little hope that this last committee’s conclu-
sion will be acted upon.

It would be too simple to say that university administra-
tors should pay more than lip service to faculty committee
recommendations. The problem is deeper than that.

According to last year’s annual report of the university
senate, faculty committees in two cases were not even
assigned because senate officers concluded that any faculty
input would be futile. The administration had already

' decided and begun to act on merging a number of disci-

plines. Despite the outward appearances of giving faculty
a say in the decision, the senate officers determined that
there was nothing they could do to change the situation.

In one case involving the merger of maternity nursing

. care for children, the executive committee of the senate

decided that vice chancellor for health sciences Nathan
Stark had already taken “irreversible” steps to accomplish
the merger, the merits of which were questionable.

The university’s Planning Resource and Management
Proposal (PRMS) requires that moves to terminate or
merge departments be reviewed by committees. On paper
it all looks good, but since things don’t really work that
way, what's the point of wasting faculty time and effort?

There are a number of things that faculty could do—or
be forced to do——to find answers to the questions raised
when the university decides to cut a department. The
criteria for consideration of the termination of a depart-
ment are outlined in the PRMS document, (centrality,
importance, budget savings, enrollment and quality). The
university senate committee however, believes those wer-
en’t met in the PRMS document outlining the depart-
ment’s termination. ‘

The faculty could do more to press for answers to those
questions. There are a number of various faculty bodies-
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Council, the College of
Arts and Sciences Council and the Faculty Assembly on-
that could demand to know why and how decisions are
being made. In ‘ addition, this refusal to acknowledge
faculty input may hurt the university in the long run; no
doubt it fosters pro-union feelings among some who may
believe a union is the only way for faculty to be heard.

It’s probably too much to expect administrators to '

change their attitudes, but it's not too much to expect that
faculty" take every step possible to become part of the
decision-making process.

Little YeIIowParking Tickets

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Those little yellow parking
tickets that Pitt police place under
the windshield wipers of cars ille-
gally parked in campus lots have
resulted in, at the very least, a case
of sheer incompetence and total
disregard of personal rights.

Yes, I was ticketed, but found
innocent. Along the way came a
series of events that would have
done Nixon proud.

I requested a hearing, which was
granted and set for 3 p.m. Sept. 28
in Justice Nicholas Diulas’
chambers.

I arrived 10 minutes early. On
seeing me, Diulas said, “You’re
innocent; we just have to fill out
some papers.” It all seemed too
easy, so I questioned Diulas,
“Innocent? Why so easy?”

He explained that nobody from
Pitt showed up, and without prose-
cution, there is no case. Something
was wrong. The judge was saying
that there was no prosecution 10
minutes before the scheduled hear-
ing time. How did he know that
they wouldn’t arrive within the
next ten minutes? Surely there is a
grace period.

The entire situation reeked of an
odor stronger than an onion. In
time, the smell grew even stronger.

I contacted the Pitt police and
they recommended that I call cam-
pus parking, who is in charge of
the tickets.

I called and spoke with Jennie
Petrolo. She said that the officer
who issued the ticket had left for
Florida to accept another job.
Hence, there wasno prosecution.

And Disregard ForiPersonal Rights

“All I'm asking is whether you
received a notice from campus
parking saying that the officer had
left town and that there would be
no case. If so, shouldn’t I have been
notified?”

“Why are you fighting this?” she
asked. V

“The principle,” I repeated.
“Will you please answer my ques-
tion. Did you get a letter from
Pitt?”

“No,” she finally answered, “but
what difference does it make? You
won the case.” A

Campus parking says a letter was
sent. Diulas’ secretary says no letter
was received. Campus parking
argues they notified Diulas that the
officer left town. Diulas’ secretary
argues they were not notified. Both
stick to their stories and offer no
other explanation.

In place of explanation, I have to
settle fo speculation. Could it be
that bot} campus police and Diu-
las knew that the officer left town?
Were they hoping that I wouldn’t
show up and therefore would be

Petrolo claimed that she sent a
letter to Diulas’ chambers, explain-
ing that the officer had left town.
So I called Diulas. His secretary
became irritated at my questions.

campus police and Diulas.both
have something to gain if I had
been found guilty? The ticket was
$33.

Looking back, I have to wonder
whether it was just a case of
imcompetence and disregard for
personal rights or something far
more damaging.

Though I was guilty, my plea
was one of extenuating circum-
stances and though I never faced
the prosecution, I was found inno-
cent. Can the same be said of cam-
pus parking and Diulas?

“Listen, you won the case,” she

said. “Why are you arguing?
What’s the big deal?”

“The principle,” I said.

“I don’t see what the problem is.

Questions About Card Reader

Dear Editor:

Right now the big question
in Holland Hall concerns the
Computerized Access Card
Reader (the box), which is cur-
rently installed in the Schenley
Quadrangle Resident Halls. Is
this box serving any purpose?
Supposedly this box checks if
the person entering is a resident
of the building. Isn't this the
function of the desk attendant?
Does the university have
nothing better to do than spend
money on a device that is
broken more than 50 percent of
the time’?

In the few weeks that this
pilot project has ‘been in effect,
the box has been more inopera-
tive jihalt operative.‘ The box

desk attendant because it
doesn't open the door. Does the
University like paying twice for
the same job? If the desk attend-
ant is doing his/herjob, why do
we need the box? Is the box sup-
posed to increase the already
tight security system? What
advantage does it add that
doesn't already exist? In our
opinion, none at all.

During class changes the lob-
bies of Holland are packed with
residents waiting to have their
IDs read so they can enter their
own building. Do we need this
added hassle? More impor-
tantly, do we want it? The
answer from many of our fellow
residents is negative.

Since this is a “computer-
ized” system, doesnft this aiso
mean that somewhere [in some

L goings

computer our comings and
are -being recorded?
We're not saying that this is
happening now, but if the data
exists, isn’t it possible to gain
access to it in the future?

If we as residents don’t voice
our opinion against the instal-
lation of the Computerized
Access Card Reader, what is
going to stop the University
from using funds for something
that we feel is unacceptable?

This is an attempt on our
part as residents and as those
directly affected to voice our
opinion against the acceptance
of the Computerized Access
Card Reader as policy. I

Dear Editor:

I am a member of this Greek
system that The Pitt News
seems to enjoy ridiculing. The
question that I have for the staff
is; Why you self-righteously
condemn the fraternities and
sororities at Pitt without under-
standing the system?

0 My first point is about the
fight outside thefraternities on
Bayard St. If I went to your
house and ‘asked why you and
your guest got into a fight,
would you greet me with open
arms and tell me the delicate
details of the argument? To
keep the news consistent, why
don’t you publish every Oak-
land bar brawl and dorm fight?

About your fabulous rush
plan, Mark A. Sindler, why
don’t you think about this?
First, I really love your state- _
ment about filling quotas.
You’re the first person I’ve
never had the pleasure to meet
who thought filling quotas was
wrong. If you were a member of
the Greek system, you would

’ know that rush is a process of
mutual selection between the
Greeks and the rushees. What_
kind of quota was The Pitt
News filling when they took
you on as an editorial writer?

I also really liked your idea

Self-Righteous
Condemnation

about rush lasting all Fall term.
If it slipped your mind, Marky
Baby, this stuff costs money.
How would you like hundreds
of people at your place every
weekend, drinking and always
leaving it a total mess? How
would you like paying for it
with your money? If you would,
I have a bridge in downtown
Pittsburgh that I’d like to show
you.

I’m going to expand on the
positive aspects of Greek life.
When was the last time another
group on campus went out and
collected tens of thousands of
dollars for a group of disabled
people or donated hundreds of
gallons of blood? How about
that great float The Pitt News
staff built for Homecoming last
year? Oh, I forgot. You don’t do
that stuff; the fraternities and
sororities do. Greek formals,
graduate functions, student
government, playing varsity
sports and even a hayride or two
are some of the events and extra-
curricular activities in which
we participate—when not guz-
zling beer and filling quotas
that is.

A last note to you, John or
Jane freshman; you don’t have
to go Greek, you want to.

Business ’83

Dear Editor: —

One shouldn’t criticize enthusi-
asm, so I will refrain from doing
that here. Instead, I shall make a
plea to redirect it. If we’re to have a
No. 1 football team, we, as No. 1
fans, should try to cheer it
accordingly.

Anyoneﬁattending the Pitt-North
Carolina game noticed that each
time the Panthers were about to
run an offensive play they
appeared to be confused. Witness
the large number of illegal proce-
dures and delay of game penalties
against Pitt. Wile it is true that the
offense probably had first game
and national television audience
jitters, the majority of the problem
could very well be blamed on us,
the fans.

Let's get with it, gang. Fans are
supposed to create a home-field
advantage, not disadvantage. Yell
loud and long, but when Marino

moves up under center, tone "it
down a little. Let’s allow Danny
the luxury of calling audibles and
allow the wide receivers a chance to
hear the snap count. If we must
drown out a quarterback with a
deluge of sound, why not make it
the opponent’s? Remember
though, that after a visiting quar-
terback has told the officials he
can’t hear three times, NCAA rules
dictate 5-yard delay of game penal-
ties ‘ against the defense (home
team) until the noise level subsides.

Watch out defense—they’ll tell
you when it’s time to ease off a
little. We can still have fun and
prove that we’re the loudest fans in
the country; we can help our team
at the same time. Oh yeah, don't
forget to pass the Panther. Pitt by

By JEFFREY HERMAN

Despite our complaining, our
gangland frats and the insistence
of the administration to—how
should I put this—fornicate with
our souls, we remain students at a
school where party noise equates
with massgcres in the Middle East.
We have a good time at Pitt
because we need a good time. After
being humiliated by professors
and chastized by “friends,” we
need the refuge of a few cold ones at
Peter’s. I am one of the types that
don’t believe that this should in
any way reflect the stature of our
alleged faltering educations. In
fact, I believe that despite all the
hoopla, our educations aren't
making it.

If that last paragraph confused
you, don’t feel bad. Don’t worry.
Don't, most of all, blame it on your
illiteracy. Who knows--it may be
mine. The fact is clear, however,
that the value of our education is
diminishing and not too many
people seem to care. Even worse,

college officials are unwilling to

confront the problem with any
decency and honesty. Certainly, it
is probably the job of the dean’s
office to enhance the reputation of
the school for which they work. It
seems to me, with my adulterated
logic, that the administration
should be making our school look
better by making it better. Appear-
ance is playing too much of a role,
probably as much of a role as pub-
lic statements on behalfof our own
merit. ,

Please don’t get me wrong. I’
don’t think that the football pro-
gram here should be abolished. I
don’t know what I would do with
my Saturday afternoons‘ if Pitt
weren’t a national contender for

111115

 

the No. 1 sport. I’m not going to, in‘
any way whatsoever, support the
“party banners” either.

If parties were banned from cam-
pus, almost one-third of the value
of my education would disappear.
Going away -to college isn’t just a
memorize-postulates-mission.

College -is a place of growth.
When guys go home from college,
their father expects a somewhat
matured brew-sucking partner.
Believe me, I know. I think that
aspect of my education has been
successful. .

Getting to the less successful
aspects of my education is a very
difficult task. In most ways I’m
quite satisfied with my education.
This goes along with the idea that
one gets what one puts into it.
Since I believe in this littlejingle, I
couldn’t possibly say I haven't
learned here. What I’m getting
at—and I don’t mean to sound
snooty—is that I don’t think a lot
of the people around me are get-
ting anything out of college.
Maybe ‘I’m nearsighted. God
knows, I don’t want an irate letter-
writing campaign to spring from
me —- some ignorant putz without
a bachelor’s degree yet.

Lately, though, I’ve gotten a lot
of bad indications of an academia
gone decadent. For instance, I
couldn’t believe the advertisements
for Cliff Notes that were all over
this publication recently. I can't
bear to believe that our society has
slipped so far into technocracy that
reading Shakespeare is too diffi-
cult, time-consuming or just plain
unworthy of a college student.

Of course, I’m not assuming that
because of a few clever little ads
that the entire campus is exchang-
ing its “Complete Shakespeare”

Keep Eyes And Minds Open

J

for Cliff Notes. I sense, nonethe-
less, that respect for the study of the
arts has diminished thoroughly.

Recently, a freshman student
was looking at my schedules say-
ing sarcastically, “Real tough
schedule you got this term.” He
then snickered and made some
snide remark about inadequacies
of those of us who seek eternal
truth-. (Or was that just my imagi-
nation?) My schedule, amongst
two writing workshops, actually
had a grad level course listed there.

The attitude was, undoubtedly, “if '

it ain't numbers, it ain't hard
enough.” Hard enough? I_went
home and cried.

Creativity is the heart of all
design, no matter how technical
the design may be. Certainly there
are people who are satisfied with a
lesser role in the engineering field.
It would seem to me, however, that
with an ever increasingly competi-
tive job market, an engineer would
take advantage of every opportun-
ity available to him.

One last thing that bothers me is
the placid way that some of today’s
college grads are viewing the
world. Yes, the days of radical pol—~
itical upheavals are over, and I
couldn’t suggest anything more
revolting to my own psyche as di-
gressing back to turbulance and
general chaos. I am persistent, any-
way, that college is here to make
able to evaluate critically our
government and our environment.
History has shown that unedu-
cated or complacent peoples are
subject to tyranny; By studying the,
world—the real world of feelings,
sensitivities and expression—an
invaluable lesson is learned: as stu-
dents and teachers we should keep
_both our minds and our eyes open._

By RUSSELL HARDIMAN

Being a recent graduate of
West Virginia University and a
full-time employee at Pitt, I was
asked after Saturday’s game if I
had wrestled with mixed emo-
tions during the contest. My
answer to that question was an
unequivocal and emphatical,
“No!” I was rooting for the
West Virginia Mountaineers all
the way! g

Beg your pardon? How’s that
again? Turncoat, you say? Not
really. I repeat, merely, that on
Saturday afternoon, I was root-
ing for the team that showed the
most class.

For four straight years I have
watched the Mountaineers get
the brains beat out of them by a
team that was usually twice as
big and twice as strong as them.
Year in andvyear out, thousands
of Mountaineer fans make the
trek to the WVU-Pitt game only
to see their beloved heroes, idols
of their heart, get plastered by
the big bully of the North.

Some might say that we
Mountaineer fans are gluttons
for punishment. Not so. Moun-

taineer rooters are merely a
breed of fan that is extinct in
Pittsburgh. That is—win or
lose—we stick by our team.

But after last Saturday’s
game, it is obvious that no such
fans exist in Pittsburgh, or if
they do, they certainly don’t
flock to Pitt Stadium.

To this Mountaineer fan (and
sometime Pitt fan, too) it was
both astonishing and deplora-
ble to see the home crowd boo
its own team. As soon as the
game took a turn for the worse
for Pitt, the boo-birds came out,
directing their wrath at Danny
Marino and the Pitt offense.
Perhaps most surprising of all
was that the loudest cat-calls
were coming from the Pitt stu-
dent section—the very heart of
Panther support.

In my four years at West Vir-
ginia, I never once heard WVU
fans boo their own team. Even
in our dismall two and nine sea-
sons, Mountaineer fans man-
aged to fill Mountaineer Field
to capacity to root for what was
at best a hapless team. (Not bad
when you consider that the

Remaining Faithful To wvu

population of Morgantown is
only 40,000).

But the Pitt fan is a different
breed altogether. After Satur-_
day’s game, I actually heard
some Pitt fans belittling the
Panthers because they didn’t
win by a bigger margin. Imean,
good grief, the Panthers win
one of the most exciting games
of the year, and still their fans
complain.

Oh, you poor spoiled babies!
Excuse Dan Marino for being
human. Excuse him for not
comleting 75 percent of his
passes. I don’t suppose it ever
occured to your warped scato-
logical brains that the problem
may not have been Marino, but
the West Virginia defense,
which gave Pitt all it could han-
dley 5a.tu.r5i_ay-

Though West Virginia may
have lost the battle yet again,
one thing is obvious after Satur-
day’s game. West Virginia fans
are first rate fans who deserve a
winner. While the Pitt partisan
are a spoiled lot who, at best,
deserve to root for the Northw-
estern Wildcats.

Beer Pelting In Bruce Hall

Dear Editor:

On Sunday, Sept. 19, 1982, at
2:30 a.m., certain occupants of the
6th floor of Bruce Hall were
accused of throwing beer out of
their window on female students.
In turn, on Wednesday, Sept.22,
1982, in The Pitt News, under
"Campus Crime,” to our surprise,
we were notified by the campus
paper that we (the accused),
“pelted large amounts of beer on
two female students," and that the
resident assistant of the 6th floor in

question the RA about the article

brought about being published in

The Inside Story: .

  Pitt Homecoming 1 QQ

According to Pitt Program Coun-
cil homecoming chairperson Margie
Taleff, this year’s homecoming is a
break from tradition. Several
changes and added attractions are
aimed at getting more people
involved in Pitt’s 1982 homecoming
events.

Homecoming committee
members chose “Up, Up and Away”
as the homecoming theme because
they believed that a lot could be
done with it in terms of publicity.
Taleff believed it was a good theme
to spark excitement among the
students—something desperately
needed in what she described as a
“make it or break it year.”

One problem she faced was gen-
erating interest in this year’s home-
coming parade, which has been
switched from its usual Friday slot
to Thursday evening. This wil allow
more high school bands to be able to
take part in the parade, making it
larger than last year.

Gina Miller, assistant director of
student activities in charge of the
PPC, said that she discussed with
Taleff the possibility of dropping the
parade and concentrating on the
carnival if this year’s involvement
was no better than last year’s was.

“Last year there was hardly any
interest and very little external invol-
vement in the parade,” Miller said.

So far, this year’s parade lineuP
includes 19 entries, six banners and
seven ﬂoats. Coach Fazio will be the
Grand Marshal for the parade,
which will also include a showing of
antique cars.

One of the reasons for the
increased response to the parade is
an SGB offer to fund up to $300 for
student organizations to build
ﬂoats. Miller said that because of
this funidng, the response has been
phenomenal.

To tie in with this year’s theme,
hot air balloon rides will be offered
on the Cathedral lawn on Tuesday,
Oct. 12 from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. These
rides are dependent on the weather
conditions; if they can’t take place
Tuesday, they will take place on the
next weather-permitting day.

Another major change in this
year’s events includes the move-
ment of the keg roll finals from their
pre-game time slot to half-time. It is

 

hoped that this change will spur
greater audience participation.

Unlike past years, there will be no
formal dance to close the week’s
activities. Instead, an informal one
will be held at Stephen Foster Me-
morial Social Hall. Homecoming
committee members felt an informal
on-campus dance would attract
more students.

in heading all the changes, Taleff’s
main goal for Pitt’s 1982 homecom-
ing is “to get everyone involved, not
just certain organizations. I want it
to be for everyone at Pitt——the
whole campus.” - '

Homecoming 1982 ﬂies “Up, Up
and Away,” with the voting of the
homecoming court. This year’s
contest boasts 19 aspiring queens
and 12 would-be kings. '

All undergraduates with a vali-
dated ID are eligible to vote at the
following places and times: the Stu-
dent Union from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
Towers lobby from 11 a.m. to 6
p.m., Benedum Hall from noon to 3
p.m., Victoria Hall from 11 a.m. to 4
p.m., the Cathedral from 11 a.m. to
4 p.m. and Lothrop from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m.

The question of whether or not
the King and Queen are important
received a resounding yes from the
candidates asked. The reason given
was that it is a matter of tradition.
One contestant in particular
stressed the importance of letting
freshmen know that there really is a
Pitt community that they can get
involved in it.

In past years, the school in which
the candidate is enrolled and the
organization who sponsored him or
her was listed on the poster showing
the candidates. This year, however,
the homecoming committee
decided that this information is
unimportant since the competition
for King and Queen is basically a
beauty contest. ’

Juniors, seniors and graduate stu-
dents are nominated by student
organizations for the Homecoming
court. Nominees must belong to
one other student group besides the
group that nominated them and
must have a QPA of 2.00 or better.

Semi-finalists will be posted out-
side -the PPC office at 5 p.m. on

Students work on their homecoming ﬂoat. According to the 1959 Owl, “old: clothes

Wednesday, Oct. 13. The five queen
and five king candidates will ride in
the Homecoming parade Thursday
evening and will be introduced at
half-time at the game on Saturday.

One unique attraction to this
year’s homecoming will be the hot
air balloon stationed on the
Cathedral lawn near Heinz Chapel.
A limited number of tickets available

at the Student Union ticket office

will entitle students to four minute
rides between 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.

One drawback to the hot air bal-
loon is that the rides are dependent
on the weather conditions. If Tues-
day proves to be miserable, the
rides will be rescheduled for Wed-
nesday and then Thursday. Specta-
tors are welcome.

A blood drive sponsored by the
Chemistry department and the PPC
will be held from 10 p.m.to 3 p.m. in
the Ashe Auditorium in the Chemis-
try Building.

Although walk-ins are welcome,
advance registration willl be held at
the PPC office.

Tuesday will end with a James
Bond film festival in David Lawrence
at 7:30. The attractions are “Live
and Let Die,” “Goldfinger” and
“Man with the Golden Gun.”
Tickets are $1 for students with a
valid ID and $2 for others.

Contrary to popular belief, every

However, Wednesday, Oct. 13 is
ihe night when students wearing Pitt

Thursday,
October 14-

Thursday is a busy day for Home-
-coming events, which will kickoff
with a parade at 6:30 p.m. Eight
ﬂoats from student organizations,
six residence -ﬂoor banners and
seven bands will take part in the
parade, which will start on Bigelow
Boulevard, move onto Fifth
Avenue, end up on Forbes, and cir-
cle around if time permits.

This year’s parade, is much larger
than last year’s, will also feature the
mounted color guard from the
Allegheny County Police, the
ROTC color guard, the Golden
Girls, the Pitt cheerleaders, Shriner
clowns, a baton core called the
Golden Triangle, SGB, the PPC,
mentors and the Black Action
Society. 3 ,

According to PPC advisor Gina
Miller, the university and city police
have been extra cooperative. Traffic
will be restricted during the parade.

The tremendous response to this
year’s parade is quite a switch from
last year’s. “The turning point was
when all of the students got together
and decided they were going to
make this year’s bigger and better,”
said Miller. “And they did.”

After the parade, a pep rally will
take place in Mazeroski field. The
King and Queen semi-finalists, the
Pitt band, Coach Fazio and several
football players will be on hand to
greet the cheering crowds.

The ever-popular Carnival will
take place from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. in
the Quad. Twenty booths from var-
ious student organizations featuring
games and food will highlight this
year’s feativities. Campus Skates
will be renting out skates to drive the
pedestrians crazy and The Core will

Homecoming 1958, officially got under way with a pep rally in the Student Union on the Friday
afternoon preceding the Pitt-West Virginia game. Saturday morning, fraternities and sororities‘ held
brunches at their houses. Before the game, nine ﬂoats, gaily decorated to the central theme of “Proverbs
on Parade,” and representing sixteen organizations, paraded before the crowds. At half time, the
Homecoming Queen, Kay Koelsch, her Maid of Honor, Janet Bleakley, and the Court circled the
stadium in a motor cavalcade to greet the 42,000 spectators. The Panthers beat the Mountaineers, after
a hard fought game, 15-8. Later in the afternoon, the fraternities and sororities held open houses for their
alumni. Climaxing the festivities Saturday night was the Homecoming Dance in the Commons Room,
featuring the band of Billy May.

Homecoming, however, meant something different to each University group. To the average student,
Homecoming was a fever-pitched football game, a time of spirit, a victory dance. To the alumni,
Homecoming was a return to the Alma Mater, a chance to recapture those brisk, football-Saturday
afternoons, the renewing of friendships with classmates and faculty. But to the Greeks, Homecoming
meant only one thing——float building. Long, tedious hours were spent for a week before that Saturday,
designing, pounding nails, molding papier mache figures, and stuffing countless napkins into chicken
wire. Finally on that cool, crisp autumn Homecoming morning, sleepy forms, sustained only by short cat
napsand innumerable cups of coffee, stepped back from the float and admired their work——the rest of
the day was anticlimactic. ’

Sugar  Bowl Heroics Bring
Pitt’s John Brown Recognition

By IRA KATZ

If you ask the average Pitt foot-
ball fans who they felt had helped
the Panthers gain national recog-
nition over the past four years on
the gridiron, names like Dan
Marino, Jimbo Covert and Julius
Dawkins would probably surface.

With a wealth of talent during
his tenure on the Panther football
team. one man has been
0verl0ol<ed——senior tight end John
Brown. Of course, Brown will go
down in Pitt football history with
his game winning reception
against Georgiain last year’s Sugar
Bowl.

However, aside form that partic-
ular play, Brown has remained rel-

* Julie Gaul(12), J-udy Young, Dlane Zack and Robin Kukalls have led the Lady Panther

volleyball team into the nationalranklngs.

In spring practice last year,
Brown made good on his oppor-
tunity to start. With the graduation
of All—America tight end Benjlie
Pryor, and capable back-up Mike
Dombrowski, the search was on for
a replacement.

“John adapted to the tight end
position very well,” said receiver
coach Joe Naunchik. “His attrib-
utes are his great speed and the
ability to catch the ball in a
crowd.”

“My philosophy is that if you go
out and do your job, everything
will fall into place,” Brown said,
adding, “My main concern now is
for us to winthe National Cham-
pionship. Anything less would be a
disappointment.”

Collier Heads

New Regime

By MARK SINDLER

To be or not to be? Hmmm,
wasn’t this query posed in some
Shakespeare play? Ah yes——it was
Hamlet.

The famous English playwright
first posed the question some 400
years ago, but it is now relevant to
the Lady Panther volleyball team.
NCAA rankings earlier ranked Pitt
17th in its Top 20 tabulation.

Thus, the ponderance that arises
is not so much whether the team
deserves to be in the national rank-
ings, but how it is that they actu-
ally became part of the nation’s
elite and can the squad retain its
position?

Sure, there is no doubt that the
entire team is playing exception-
ally well. They now have won four
consecutive tournament cham-
pionships, giving them a 21-2
record. Simply put, they look great.

But....

Well, coach Shelton Collier put
the matter in a realistic perspective,
sayifig, “First of all, we do not have
the caliber of players who are ordi-
narily in the Top 20. There are usu-
ally several All—America candidates
on Top 20 teams.

“Basically, we have a foundation
of players with equal ability,” he
added. “I just do not know if the
girls can keep on winning as they
have been.”

Based on prior performances
though, there is no concrete reason
that the squad cannot sustain its
record-setting pace. After all, this is
the first time a Panther women’s
volleyball team has been nation-

 

-
er  

/ .

/

  

ally ranked. Tachikara—the Japa-
nese volleyball manufacturer——has
the Lady Panthers ranked at 21 in
its poll.

Despite his earlier statements,
Collier has savored the taste of vic-
tory. “Sure, we are excited,” he
said. “First, it means we are
respected nationally which is dif-
ferent for a team from the East, and
second, this team was not supposed

to even be close to the Top 20 at the ,.

outset.”

A primary ingredient in vaulting
Pitt into the limelight is Collier.
Collier has participated in seven
national championships and has

served as head or assistant coach for V

13 teams that finished in the Top 5
nine times.

“I feel that through my experien-
ces as a coach and a player, ‘I am
aware of the ingredients of devel-
oping a nationally-ranked team,”
he said.

Collier cites other components,
including the leader-ship provided
by seniors Julie Gaul, Robin Kuka-
lis and Diane Zack. .

“They know what is expected of
them, and they follow through,”
he said. “Robin is a classic example
of our success attitude. She often
makes mistakes in games but main-
tains a confident ‘we will do wha-
tever it takes to win’ attitude.” ‘

He also mentioned that despite
the team’s progress, it is nowhere
near where he wants it to be by the
time the NCAAS roll around.

Cinderella team or not, the Lady
Panthers are having a ball. How-
ever, as Collier said, “One more
injury, and we are done. We would
be in big trouble.”

Dukovich Hits The Books
Like They Are Players

By BRIAN BALK

His head was embedded in a
book, studying intensely for an
upcoming neuro-behavior test.

This scene of Panther foot-
ball player Rich Dukovich
studying zealously for an exam
typlifies his play on the football
field—a hard worker—out to
achieve every individual and
team goal.

Dukovich, 6-0, 190 lbs., plays
as the fifth defensive back-
called the nickleback—-—and also
spends time on the Panther spe-
cial teams. Since the nickleback
formation is used by teams with
a tendency to pass more fre-
quently than run, Dukovich
sometimes lacks playing_time.

However, two weeks ago in
pass—happy Illinois country, he
found himself between the side-
lines, rather than out of bounds.

“I was in my glory at Illi-
nois,” Dukovich said of the
game, in which he intercepted
one of Tony Eason’s passes. “I
fulfilled my aspirations
because—finally-—-I was tired
from a game. I knew ,I
contributed.”

He is a team man, and he
believes that a total team effort
is the key to winning.

“A lot of people have been
saying that our defense has been
winning the games for us," he
said,“but the offense is putting
the points on the board. We an
work as a team to win.

“The offense as a unit is play-
ing well. Offense always needs a
bit more polish because of the
complexity, but they have a
great degree of talent. They are
only doing badly in the eyes of
outsiders who are expecting
more. Compared to other
teams’ offensive statistics, our
offense is doing great.”

A major problem for the
Panthers is that fans don’t com-
prehend the state of mind in
which Panther opponents play.
As Dukovich explained, “Since
we are ranked No. 1, other
teams make us their game. We
have to be totally aware of this
in order to win.”

Dukovich began his football
career at Bethel Park High
School in Pittsburgh’s South
Hills. There, he led the Black-

hawks in the quarterback spot
and as a defensive back.

Although he was highly
sought after by many colleges,
his heart was always set on Pitt.

“I was only recruited here as a
defensive ‘back, but that's all I

wanted to do anyway,” he said. -

“I always liked the area and I
always wanted to play for Pitt.”

The stereotype of “dumb
jock” doesn‘t fit Dukovich.
Currently a behavioral neuro-
science major, he plans to
attend dental school at Pitt.

“It is a great asset to have the
members of our team shine all
at once,” Dukovich said. “I
never saw a team more enthusi-
astic about a season.

“Everyone, was up at the sta-
dium this summer lifting and
working his hardest. It’s going
to be tough because everyone is
shooting for us, but we want
1982 on that (stadium) wall out
there." ‘

With team players like Rick
Dukovich, by the time Jan. 1
rolls around, there just might
be some fresh paint on the sta-
dium wall.

N0 all-star games...

Until a court decides on the
legality of such games, the
National Football League Players
Association has postponed its pro-
posed all-star series until further
notice.

Earlier yesterday, the St. Louis
Cardinal football team filed a suit
to prevent seven players from join-
ing an NFC East all-star team. The
NFC East would have played the
Eastern Division of the American
Conference at Washington’s
Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on
Sunday.

The seven players were running
back Ottis Anderson, wide receiver
Pat Tilley, quarterback 'Neil
Lomax, guard Terry Stieve and
Curtis Greer.

Lady Panthers N0. 17....

For the first time in its history,
the Pitt Lady Panther volleyball
team has been ranked in the Top

20, according to a recent‘NCAA \

poll. The team currently has a 22-2 "

record, with wins in the Pitt Pre-
view, the Pitt Classic and the West
Virginia Invitational.

Condztioning time...

The Panther cross country team
will run in a conditioning meet
this Saturday in Akron, Ohio. The
meet will serve as a tuneup for the

1,>;Iy DALE MOORE

Pitt is No. l in the nation.
Wrong, you say. Both the UPI and
the AP polls have placed the Pan-
thers in the second slot.

Yes, but those ranks are directed
at football. The alumni of this col-
lege are unequaled when it comes
to complaining. Meet someone on
the street and they start griping
about something. Nearly everyone
does it, but those at this university
seem to have a special flair for
complaining.

Take the football team. The Pitt
Panthers, 4-0, ranked No. 2 in the
nation, the pride of this half of
Pennsylvania, have an outstanding
football team. This season, they
have already defeated three Top 20
teams, the defense not allowing a
touchdown. If someone wasn’t
aware of this and asked a student
on campus how the Panthers were
doing, the response would be more
like the team was 0-4 rather than
4-0. ~

This visitor would be told about
quarterback Dan Marino, who
now must know how Rodney Dan-
gerfield feels. Marino has lost the
respect of his student body. Would-
be Bear Bryants called for his remo-
val against West Virginia. Just for
one series, they argued, to bring
him back to earth.

This made as much sense as
throwing a brick to a drowning
man, trying to scare him into learn-
ing how to swim. Marino will be
the first to say that he has made
mistakes, like trying to sqeeze the
ball through the eye of a needle.
When the ball fits, it’s a good pass,
but this is expected of Marino.
When the pass misses, as has been
the case often this season, he is a
bum. ‘.

He has fell victim to the Ameri-
can dream. Hometown boy makes
good and takes his team from

defeat to victory against Georgia in
last year's Sugar Bowl.

A fitting end to a season of an
underdog Panther squad finishing

 

with an ll—l record. National
arr laim was given to Marino, some
calling him a pro quarterback
playing in college. Interviewers
were at his locker room stall more
often than a mailman at a door.

With a reputation like this, how-
ever, comes the notion that any-
thing less than perfection is'a
disappointment.

Take the Pitt-WVU game. Nine

of 10 game watchers will complain .

of how poorly Marino performed
and how well Jeff Hostetler, the
West Virginia quarterback, moved
the Mountaineers.

The statistics are contradictory.
Marino completed 20 of 41, nearly
identical to Hostetler’s 19 of_39.
Marino threw one more intercep-
tion than his counterpart, but he
also threw a touchdown pass. Hos-
tetler didn’t.

Granted, Hostetler was under
more pressure and took more of a

beating than did Marino, but he
drove his squad for only three of
West Virginia’s 13 points. And
more importantly, Marino lead the
Panthers into the end zone twice in
crucial fourth quarter situations,
snatching victory from the Moun-
taineers. I

For this feat, Marino received no
praise, although the crowd stopped
booing. It is this kind of play that is
expected of Marino each week,
regardless of the opponent.

Last season, Pitt's first four
opponents were unranked. This
year, three of the four have been
ranked. No matter how talented
Marino is, his performance against
North Carolina cannot be com-
pared to that against Cincinnati.

The defense has saved Pitt’s hide
more than once this season, but
without the persistence of the

’offense—Marino included—Pitt

could have two losses. Instead, the
Panthers are 4-0, with people still
complaining about a No. 2
ranking.

If there were a course called Foot-
ball 22, after the first four weeks,
the book on Marino would read,
“Above average but room for
improvement. Grade: B.”

Carrying a B in that class is
nothing to complain about.

Colas

Cross
Team

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Optimism—-something that has
been missing from the Panther
cross-country team in the past
years. With new Coach John Vas-
vary and an impressive perfor-
mance in its first meet, though,
things are looking up.

Another reason for this upswing
in attitude is junior Todd Colas.

Colas, from Manassas, Va.,
accepted a scholarship to Pitt with
the intention of gaining All-
America honors. This distinction

 only narrowly escaped him this

T past track season. With a cross-

xx;

country season ahead of him, his
optimism is quite evident.

“The Big East is one of the
toughest conferences for'cross-
country and track,” Colas said. “I
feel we will make our mark this
season, though taking the title
would be too much to expect. A
maximum effort is presently being
put forth by everyone on the team,
placing us in excellent shape for
the year.”

Colas’ optimism and efforts have
impressed head coach Vasvary.

“Todd is one of our top
runners,” Vasvary said. “He is very
important in the team’s success.

’ We count heavily upon him and he

has responded with a leadership
that is not commonly found. He
has all the ability and I can see
nothing but great things in the
future.”

During his high school years,
Colas became familiar with the
success of Vasvary. Vasvary
coached 13 years at the high school
level in Virginia before taking the
position of head coach at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Colas believes Vasvary has influ-
enced the team. “He’s a great moti-
vator. We all place quite a bit of
faith in him, and it is that much
easier when you’re dealing with

gr someone as knowledgeable as he.”

Presently, Colas is running as
the No. 2 man behind junior Bill
Moorehead. With two years left
and plenty of good performances
behind him, Colas said, “I know
quite well that I have not reached
my potential yet, so I can’t consider
my prior feats that successful. I’m
looking forward to a consistent
upgrade in all aspects of my
running."

If action speaks louder than
words, then Colas’ optimism is
well—founded and Pitt's track and
cross-country future is bright.

Hall Scores Big For Panther Clubbers

By TAMMY ANDERSON

In order to have a successful field
hockey team, a squad needs a capa-
ble goal scorer. After all, the objec-
tive of the sport is to put the ball
into the net.

Margie Hall has served in this
role for the Lady Panther field
hockey team for the past four years.

Hall, a senior, has often found
herself in the right place at the
right time, however, it hasn't been
purely by luck. Hall was Pitt's
leading scorer last season and cur-
rently leads the team in goals this

season. Coach Cindy Baldridge
credits Hall’s ability to score goals
to “aggressive play and outstand-
ing hustle.”

After playing the defensive posi-
tion of halfback her sophomore
and junior years in high school,
Hall switched to the forward line
and found she fit in well. Since her
graduation from Notre Dame High
School in East Stroudsburg, Pa.,
Hall has been an offensive starter
for Pitt's field hockey team since
her freshman year.

Hall was named to the Mid East t

Selection Team in 1979 and to the

peted in both games her freshman
and sophomore years, but could
not compete last year because of
financial restrictions.

She said, “I couldn't play in
Nationals my junior year because
of the cost, and if I get selected for
any team this year, I won’t be able
to play again for the same reason.
When the money is not in the
team’s budget, it's hard for any
player for these teams to play in the
games."

Hall has played under three differ-
ent coaches. She said she doesn't
believe this has been an obstacle to
her improvement as a player.

“I think I’ve become a better
player from it because I ‘have
learned something different from
each coach that I didn‘t know
before," Hall said.

Baldridge said having Hall on
the team is a great asset.

“Margie is a quiet leader on and
off the field. She is one of our tri-
captains this year because she has

the ability to lead by being a good
teacher. Margie’s the kind of player
that coaches like to have on their
teams,” Baldridge said.
Sophomore Ramona Kusuplos
said, “Margie is a good leader and
teacher because she is very patient.
Some people get frustrated over
other people's personal ability or
team play, but Margie accepts you
as you are. She offers tips for
improvement if she can and she is

willing to accept criticisms and,‘

help on her own play as well.”

Hall has high goals for the 1982
season. “I want to go with a bang
this year because it is my last year to
play. I’d like to have a winning
season this year, and even though
we are currently 1-4, I feel good
about our season and being able to
win most of our remaining
games.”

The Lady Panther field hockey
team will miss Hall’s play in its
next season. Although Hall won’t

‘graduate until 1984 because of a

change in major, she will end her
college hockey career. NCAA rules
allow only four years of competi-
tion in any one sport.
