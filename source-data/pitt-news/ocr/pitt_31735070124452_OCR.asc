Police warn students about underage drinking

ZAC ANDERSON

Daily lllini

(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -
Although classes have just begun, more
than 100 University of Illinois students
learned their ﬁrst lesson of the new
school year when they received notices
to appear in court for alcohol-related
offenses over the weekend.
Champaign and Urbana police
departments combined their efforts in a
large—scale attempt to enforce underage
drinking laws in the campus area.
Murphy’s Pub, The Clybourne, the
Canopy Club and Gully’s were all raid-

ed by police officers on Friday evening,
according to a Champaign Police
Department press release. Eleven bar
arrests were made at Gully’s, six at
Murphy’s, ﬁve at Clyboume and three
at the Canopy Club, the release stated.
Urbana police also gave notices to
appear in court to more than 80 stu-
dents, mostly underage, who were
attending house parties over the week-
end, said Lt. Michael Cooper of the
Urbana Police Department.

The statement issued by
Champaign police said, “The goal of
this enforcement activity was to
decrease the number of underage
drinkers and alcohol—re1ated violations

through aggressive enforcement of
local ordinances and saturation patrols.”

The large number of arrests is
directly correlated to the beginning of
the school year. Police officers were
well aware that without school obliga-
tions many students would be out party-
ing, Cooper said.

A special unit of extra officers was
organized over the weekend to patrol
Urbana neighborhoods and bars. Police
worked on foot, bikes and in automo-
biles to prevent alcohol violations and
other crimes, Cooper said.

“We had a detail of some extra ofﬁ—
cers  they were supposed to look for
suspicious people and keep their eyes

open for parties,” Cooper said.

One of the many ticketed was Ben
Graniczny, an 18-year-old freshman at
Moraine Valley Community College
who was visiting his friends for the
weekend. Graniczny was sitting on the
porch outside a party in Urbana when
he and his friends were approached by
police officers. . _

“They actually didn’t see me with
anything in my hand,” Graniczny said.
“They just kind of said we were all
drinking.”

_However, Graniczny said he had
been drinking earlier and admitted so to
the officers. Others on the porch did
have open alcohol containers so the
officers approached the house and gave
notices to appear in court to Graniczny
and his friends. ‘

Similar instances were common

‘throughout Urbana over the weekend.
-Urbana police are taking a tougher

approach to underage drinking than
they have in the past, Cooper said.

“If we see people drinking, we have
the right, to investigate and see if they

are of age or not,” said Cooper. “If you ‘
have underage drinkers at a party, you _

are taking a chance.”

Cooper said that if police see peo-
ple outside a residence with alcohol
they can investigate further without
being called to the scene. If nobody is
outside, police must be called to inves-
tigate a noise violation or a similar com-
plaint. '

8   OPINIONS  

EDITORIAL
To survive at Pitt, don’t take

a lesson from television

Some startling news for fresh-
men: you may soon ﬁnd yourself
drawing» a number of parallels
between your life at Pitt and the pop
culture phenomenon “Survivor.” The
much—hyped television program that
dramatically concluded last
Wednesday has surprising similarities
with the collegiate experience.

One obvious connection is the
island-esque nature of the University.
Though Pitt is a well—integrated part
of a major metropolitan area, it is in
many ways a community unto itself.
All colleges are. You and your fellow
students eat in the same places,
cohabitate the same small space,

party at the same shindigs and gener-

ally share similar socialexperiences.
“Survivor” isn’t the “r ” world, and,
as parents are apt to remind you, nei-
ther is college. ‘

Then there is the aspect of com-
petition. The cast-offs
“Survivor” exist in the University
system as those who could not, for
one reason or anoﬂier, make the aca-
demic cut. These include the kids
who didn’t study enough and failed
out, the hooligans who committed
some sort of judicial offense and were
kicked out or the poor folks who were
forced to drop out because of various
extenuating circumstances.

Competition in college is mani-
fest in many forms, the most obvious

from '
» Blind greedy ambition worked for

- cast—offs.

being the classroom. Bell curves pit
you against your fellow man and
woman, so that your classmates
essentially become your tribal coun-
cil. You forrn alliances by making
study groups, and it’s also possible to
back stab your peers in a variety of
ways, i.e. pretending to help out a
confused friend but really giving him
or her the wrong information.

In all probability, infectious dis-
eases of the “Survivor” persuasion
could be found on Pitt’s campus.
Dormitories are notoriously recog-
nized as home to all sorts of gross
specimens such as bed bugs, ﬂu
germs and the frmgi that cause ath-
1ete’s foot. Furthermore, spending a
day lounging outside the Cathedral
without sun block could surely earn
you a sunburn of tropical intensity. ’

Wlﬂl this is mind, freshmen and

-even uppercﬁssmenﬁmight want to

reconsider how best to survive, at Pitt.

Richard Hatch —-- and it might work
for you too. But the beautiﬁil thing
about college, and the critical diﬁer-A
ence between Pitt and “Survivor,” is
that at college, there need not be any
Malice and sneakiness
aren’t really necessary to get ahead in
this context. With honesty, coopera-
tion and loyalty to ourselves and oth-
ers, we might all have a shot at sur-
viving these four years.

me, and so was Big Panda, my most
favorite stuifed toy. In the slightly dark, slightly
unnerving back room of Inka Dinka-Doo, a burly
man without much hair introduced us. I told him
precisely where Iwanted you to go; he then stuck
a small cork in my nostril, quickly poked through
the skin with a needle and promptly inserted you
in the tiny hole.

And we have been nearly inseparable ever
since. You have been with me as I plodded
through the last school year, as I’ vemet new peo-
ple and strove to make a good impression, as I’ ve
lived, learned and experienced a varied range of
human interactions. : ,

Your presence has certainly colored the
scope and nature of these experiences —— though
perhaps not as much as I had originally hoped or
anticipated. _

I thought that you might instantly make me
look dilfeient or intriguing. Sure, I know I’m not
the only gal on the block with a pierced nose, but
I thought it might be at least a little unique, a litﬂe
exciting.‘ You know, add a dash more alterna and
a pinch more chic to the nerd-alterna-chic look
that I am constanﬂyin pursuit of projecting. -

Ieven expected thatl might be treated a little
differently. That shopkeepers might distrust me
and old ladies might be afraid. That I might expe-
rience the strange thrill of someone regarding my
relatively wholesome self, if only momentarjly,
as a real bad—news bear.

 You didn’t exactly let me down, but you did-

_ n’t change things as much as I had expected,

wasn’t exactly receptivewhen she

and a part of my life.

Then there were the hockey  with the ‘ I ‘I

was fairly certain you wouldn’t comply with
league regulations; I was hesitant to take you out

since the hole was still fresh but didn’t want you ‘

causing any penalties. So before the Penn State
game, I devised a simple solution —— a small, art-

fully cut piece of Band—Aid strategically placed to » ' 

conceal you from referees and vicious opponents.
We’ve had good times, too. You look really
nice with big pants and complement certain T--

shirts very well.‘ It has been fun dressing you up  

with sparkly rhinestones for special occasions,

like Christmas Eve service at church.

Tursnmr, Aucusr 29, 2000

Not all college kids wait tables or have temp jobs
during the summer. Patrick Jordan, a senior interdis-
ciplinary major at Pitt, spent his summer in a tent
with a bunch of strangers and some congas. No, he
wasn’t in some sort of ritualistic male-bonding sem-
inar; he actually got paid to play conga drums in the
shape of Pringles cans at every major concert this
summer at I. C. Light Amphitheater and the Post-
Gazette Pavilion, and -lure concert-goers into the pro-
motion with the bait of ticket upgrades and free tat-
toos. -

The Pitt News: How did you get this job?

Jordan: I had worked at Starlake Amphitheater in
marketing and promotions and setting up private par-
ties for the past two years. I wasn’t going to do  this
summer, though. My car was actually _the reason. I

didn’t think it could make the trip everyday anymore. _
But then a friend of mine called me at the beginning ’

of the summer and told me about this job. I had had
minimal drumming experience and it was just too
good to pass up. ’ '

TPN: Are you super-protective of your drums?

Jordan: Yeah, totally protective. If they get hurt and V

it’s my fault, I’m responsible. That’s one of the rea-

sons I didn’t work at the Ozzfest. Last year the crowd 
set things on ﬁre and it got pretty crazy. It was for my _.

own safety and for the drums.

REHAN NASIR/ EDITOR IN CHIEF

TPN: What kinds of people want to
play Pringles congas? '

Jordan: Every type of person comes
into my tent. One weekl did shows for
Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes,
The Who, Martina McBride, Poison,
Steely Dan, Yes and Kansas, The B-
52s and Sting. I saw a slice of the

TPN: Have any
famous people come into

your tent this summer? ,
Jordan: Yeah, the drummer from
Vlfide Spread Panic came in to‘. play
and the conga player from Cypress
Hill did, too. Jimmy Page’s entourage
came in the day of his show and
propositioned some young woman.
They were like [very affected British accent], “Mr.
Page is looking for some company this evening.
Would any of your ladies be interested?” And the
poor girls didn’t know what they meant. They kept

asking if they could go backstage and get autographs

and stuff.

TPN: What was the best concert you worked at this

summer? V ‘ .

Jordan: Kiss, by far. Not only were the people a» trip, it
all deckedout in face paint, but I was able to‘ get my.

Each band’s song covers a dif- -

ferent aspect of the show, including-

the innocence of Bubbles, the com'- ’

bativeness of Buttercup and the

vanity of Blossom. The album’s-

song order tells a story similar to an
episode of the show with a battle
against the sinister Mojo Jojo, with
his subsequent defeat coming by the

album’s end. Intermixed between '_

the songs is dialogue of the charac-

Given all the bad press about the
misogyny in the Middle East, it’s hard
to believe that any foreign woman
would visit there on purpose.
According to the tenets of Islam,
women cannot enter a mosque, can’t
speak openly and in many countries are
not allowed to show their faces in pub-
lic. So how could the dry peninsulas of
the Arab world possibly appeal to a

, female American?

For Suzannah Pace, the draw was
the images. A self-taught photographer,
Pace traveled the Middle East in 1998
to search for photogenic people and
places. She described what she experi-
enced as being “socially and culturally
ostracized” — a bad situation for a cul-
tural anthropologist, but perfect for an
artist.

Pace is consistent about where she
aims her camera: kids, cars and creepy-
looking men — and that’s it. Her sub-
ject matter is so limited, and the exhib-
it so small, that she depends wholly on
style to make the series worthwhile.

Fortunately, style she has in spades.
Alternating between color and black
and white, Pace shoots scruffy men,
mostly middle-aged, sitting in their
three—wheeled trucks. The vehicles are
covered with tiny lights and reﬂective
doodads, standing in brilliantly illumi-
nated squares and side streets. ‘ The
faces are focused, but their surround-
ings are lost in frenzied, glowing lights.

She also depicts merchants sitting
in their kiosks in open—air markets,
ﬂanked by rows of apples, tubs of dates
and olives, and tables, built from
stacked crates.

Her portraits of children are cute
but less powerful. Kids stand in alley-
ways or pose in the street; in one color
photo, two children meander down a
crooked sidewalk, holding a makeshift
kite constructed from a clear plastic
tarp. Women, not surprisingly, are sel-
dom present. , 7

But while she claims to be unique
as an outsider — a mere shadow in a
man’s society —- Page has underesti-
mated the impact of her presence.

The most provocative aspects of
Page’s work are the facial expressions
of the men in the street.
American vacation snapshots, they

aren’t smiling generically, nor are they _
looking at some distant horizon (a la ‘
glamorheadshots); These. men are star.—- .-

Unlike, A

ing directly at the camera — sometimes
hostile, sometimes calm, but always
attentive. Just as Page is capturing
these images for patrons in another
country, the image is watching her
back, assessing this foreigner with her
eavesdropping lenses. Despite the
beauty of these nameless and scraggly
streets, the visages of their inhabitants
are almost ominous. In that sense, Page
makes the work autobiographical,
using surrounding
faces to describe.

However, it wasn’t to be for head coach
Jolnmy Majors and the Panthers. ‘

Pitt held a 7-6 lead at half time after
Tony Dorsett’s 2-yard touchdown run in
the second quarter. V

But Penn State outscored Pitt 15-0

Nov. 22, 1975 — Penn“ State 7, Pitt 6

In one of the most heartbreaking
defeats of Pitt’s football history, the“
Panthers fell to the Nittany Lions by. a
single point after leading most of the
game. d d

3‘ Pitt took the lead in the second
quarter when Elliott Walker busted
through the PSU defensive line for a 37.-
yard touchdown run. However, Long’s
extra point was blocked.

The Panthers were still holding on
to the 6-0 lead in the fourth quarter,
when Penn State ﬁnally got on the
scoreboard. Steve Geise scored on a 29-
yard run at the 8 minute mark in the
quarter, and Bahr kicked the extra point
to give the Nittany Lions the 7-6 lead.

‘ this paper discussing Bill Cowher’s tempo-

rary benching of Kordell Stewart as the
quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelersin
favor of veteran Mike Tomczak The team
was on its late-season slide, and Cowher
told the city ﬂzrat Stewart would be moved
down to third on the depth
chart, moving former
standout Pete
Gonzalez to the backup
slot.

The column -ended: “But
whether or not these changes
are the right ones for the
Steelers, they are at least changes
after a long period of accusation.

 

 

end to the blame game.”
Well, in this preseason, Kent Graham

has outplayed Stewart, even with a sub-
par groupof linemen and receivers. He has

thrown for 335 yards  season, with three
touchdowns and an interception, compared
to Stewart’s 238, 1 and 2. But Stewart start-
ed throughout the preseason, being the play-
er that the Steelers had given all of their con-

» ﬁdence and money.

demoted Stewart yesterday, this time claim-
ing that  would be the starter for the
foreseeable future.
The surprise comes ﬁom the image that
Stewart was Cowher’s baby. It comes from
the same coach that once
kissed his young quarter-
back on the cheek, con-
ceivably out of apprecia-
tion of his potential. 
But, unfortunately for
Cowher, the protege was not up
to the incredible awe that was
made of him.
But while Cowher may
have solved one quarter-

  back problem yesterday,

, he also proved on

Tufnef Sunday how big the

remaining problems at

the position still are. The team made their

ﬁnal cuts that day, and one of the released

was second-year quarterback Anthony
Wright in favor of rookie Tee Martin

Then, heartbreak set in for Long.
First, he missed a 23-yard ﬁeld goal just
after the Penn State touchdown. Then,
given a second chance to win the game,
he lined up for a 45-yarder with 8 sec-
onds left. However, the kick was wide,
and the Panthers lost.

Nov. 26, 1976 — Pitt 24, Penn State 7

Ranked No. l in the counuy, the 10-
0 Panthers capped off a perfect regular
season with a win over Penn State.
However, the game was far from regular,
as Penn State didn’t back down.

After Penn State had taken a 7-0
lead, Dorsett tied the game on a 6—yard
run in the second quarter. With his star

running back struggling in the first half,
Majors moved Dorsett from halfback to
fullback for the second half. The strategy
worked. Dorsett burst through for a 40-
yard touchdown run just over a minute
into the second half, and by the end of the
game, he had 224 yards rushing.

Dorsett was a few days away from
being named as the winner of the
Heisman Trophy, but his showing gave
him an NCAA single-season record of
1,948 yards and made him the first play-
er in NCAA history to rush for over 6,000
yards in a career.

Also, Long redeemed himself by
making a 47-yard ﬁeld goal as well as all
three of his extra—point attempts.

Sept. 9, 1982 — Pitt 7, UNC 6 » A _
In a matchup that will be seen again
on Nov. 4 of this year, the Panthers and

the Tar Heels fought it out at Three-

Rivers Stadium.

The season-opening game pitted the
top—ranked Panthers and star quarterback
Dan Marino against the No. 5 Miami
squad, which featured talented running
back Kelvin Bryant.

V Defense was the name of the game in
this contest, as the 13 total points in the

game indicate. North Carolina was up 3-‘

0 in the third quarter when Marino found
Bryan Thomas on a 4-yard screen pass to
give Pitt the lead, and the defense held

Behind the outstanding play of
defensive lineman Bill Maas and line-
backer Charles “Yogi” Jones, Pitt ‘kept
UNC out of the end zone.

Maas played a big part in limiting
Bryant and the other Carolina runners to

les in the victory. _
Nov. 27, 1998 —— WVU 52, Pitt 14

It was 16 years after the UNC game
when Pitt returned to the stadium only to
see its miserable season get worse.
Coming into the game with a 2-8 ‘record,
Pitt fell victim to a WVU attack led by
runner Amos Zereoue and quarterback
Marc Bulger.

Bulger, a native of Pittsburgh, threw
for 409 yards and six touchdowns on the
day. Zereoue ran for 110 yards in the rout.
Pitt’s quarterbacks struggled, as ' Matt
Lytle completed ﬁve of 19 passes for 63
yards with two interceptions, while Matt
O’Connor made six of 14 passes for 72
yards with two interceptions. _

WVU broke the game open with a
28-point second quarter,’ and the 14
points that the Mountaineers scored in
the third quarter eliminated any doubt.

with the injured players at camp, and his

sprained ankle. is healing well. Harris did Z _l

seem optimistic about Grim’s condition.
“Latef might play a little Saturday,”

, Hanis said. “He’s feeling much better.”

A more serious case is that of Dustin
Picciotti, the highly-touted fullback from
Chalfont, Pa., who wasinjured in the Big 33
Classic, a high school football ‘ball-star game."
‘ Picciotti sustained a concussion in the

‘ game and shortly thereafter was diagnosed

with strep throat. Harris believes that nei-
ther problem has been solved yet.

mi“-‘He’s’ still beat up from the Big 33,”

Harris said. “He wanted to be the last of the
tough guys and he tried too hard. To show

you the kind of guy he is, he tried to sneak 9

into practice a few times last week and take
some reps.” — K

Harris expects Picciotti to be out at least
two weeks.

It could be that Martin, who led the 1998
Tennessee team -to the national champi-

onship, has ﬂashed the signs of brilliance in -

practice necessary to show the coaches he is
worthy of making the team. But he has not
shown that in the preseason games this year.
. Added to that is that thisis the third back-
up quarterback in three years to be cut. First,
Mike Quinn was released to make room for
Gonzalez. Then, he was thrown out after
last season in favor of Wright. Is it a player
development problem? .
Graham, known as a journeyman playe ,

may help the Steelers win this year, but he ‘

probably is not the long-terrn solution to the
team’s problems. ‘

And fans should be wondering whether
they should have conﬁdence in the team’s
young quarterback talent.
