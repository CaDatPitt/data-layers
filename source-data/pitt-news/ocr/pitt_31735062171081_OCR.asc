Hosts High School Finals   A I 

by DAVE MAJERNIK

, One ofvthe University’s cons_is-
tently winning teams,’the William
‘Pitt Debate Union, will host the
National High School Speech" and
Debate Finals, with state and dis-

trict champions from 49 states

June 17 to 21.

jJ_A_cc'ording to Dr.\Thomas Kane.
director of the Pitt Debate Union.

5 35 different debates will be going

on simultaneously at any particu-
lar time during the conference.

At the recent National Debate
Tournament, a Pitt team of two

debators‘ finished fifth among ,

the 62 teams in competition from
all major universities. Pitt de-

bators have scored highly in many I

other national collegiate. tourna-
ments, said Kane. '

Other activities in which the De-
bate Union’s 30 members parti-
cipate are: weekly meetings for
practice debates and reports on
public performances; an intercol-
legiate program with 500 debates.
35 major trips; and a high school

from major universities for about
50 highschools each year.

Kane said the two main pur-
poses of the Debate Union are "to
train students in techniques of
-analysis, argument, and public ad-
dress, and to motivate them to

‘inquire into controversial issues.“

Any Pitt student can join the
Debate Union, said Kane, if he is
willing toxwork hard. Most mem-

bers, he admitted, however, are

students planning to go to law
school.

‘Each year a controversial topic
is chosen which all college debate
teams must research endlessly
and be able to argue both sides.

"Where else, in the whole Uni-
versity curriculum can you learn
such a massive amount of infor-
mation about one subject than
from debating." asked Kane.

Chuck Steeber, president of Col-
lege Young Republicans at Pitt
and state secretary of that organ-
ization, agreed with Barry Gold-
water about the Watergate affair.

V "The whole thing stinks," Steeb-
er said. But at this point, Steeber
is unwilling to speculate on wheth-
er or not Nixon is involved.

David Washington, president of
the Pitt Young Americans ‘for
Freedom, however. insisted.

' “Nixon didn’t have anything to do
‘with theplanning of it." If a direct
link is found, however, between
Nixon and Watergate, Washington
predicted, "He’s done. They’ll im-
peach him, or try to."

Both students emphasized that
it was the Committee to Re-Elect

the President that is implicated.

here and not the Republican Par-
_ ty as a whole.

n "Many people who are trying to
get to the.bottom of it areiRepub—
lican senators,“ Steeber pointed
out. Washington underlined this
point. "Thank God none of the

¢;g,Republican Committee was in-
volved in it. \
When asked about the possibil-
ity that Republicans running for
Congress 'in 1974 will dissociate
themselves from Nixon to avoid
the taint of a scandal. Washington
responded. "It‘s only fair. Nixon
dissociated.himse1f from congres-
sional campaigns last year. He
spent not a cent on congressional
campaign. that is how they had
money for bugging."

Steeber was extremely bitter

\ about the '72 campaign. He com- '

plained that the Committee to Re-

 publicans to “stay _,aw_ay”, from"

the’ traditionally big Republican

contributors, because they (the'

ident) would ‘-‘take care of them.”
This money,'according to Steeber,
was collected by the Committee

to Re-Elect the President and

“never given back to the local
campaigns.” *

President will depend on "wheth-
er or not Nixon is exonerated."

Although he feels the situation)
.is "real bad." Steeber said, "I-

don‘t think it will destroy the Re-
publican Party. as some people
hope it will.'.' Reaffirming his
faith in the party, Steeber assert-
ed. "If they had let the Republi-
can Party do things. this would
not have happened because the
Republican ‘Party does not do
things this way."

parties believe, however, thatra
. $5 fee for add-dropping is not a
solution to the problem. V
Dutton believes that a $5 fee
can help to cut down the student
«abuse end’ of the add-drop prob-
lem. In one instance, a student
used 24—add-drops and in another
case, a student registered for 27
credit hours, thereby closing peo-
ple out of some courses. Dutton
said that these two cases are def-
inite instances of student abuses
of add-dropping.

When asked why the $5 fee will
not be in effect for the fall term,
Dutton replied that fall registra-
tion began on March 4 and the fee
was announced on March 21. As a
result some people already reg-
istered and used their one free
add-drop before the March 21 an-
nouncement. It was felt to be un-
fair to tell a student that he or
- she has already used .his or.\ her
one free add-drop even though the
transaction. occurred before the
fee announcement.

Dutton stated that a few years
ago there were about 3,000 add-
drops perterm. During the past
winter term 15,000 addedrops

‘ were processed. According to the

Vice Chancellor the cost of pro-.
cessing an add-drop exceeds $5.
Dutton said the University must
"take dollars from education just
to get you (the student) register-
ed.“ ‘

In addition, Dutton stressed that
students wouldn’t have been
charged the fee under certain
circumstances such as when a
student must add-drop through no

fault _of his own" but because of‘, ;
certain inadequacies of the'Uni-jF‘;

one end of the add-drop proposal. 
Other areas like time schedules f "j
where teachers are not listed for A. 
specific courses, advising, and,‘ 
registration, also need to be ana- 
lyzed to weed out inefficiences Ff’
which increase add-drops, ac-' ’ 

c_ording to the Vice Chancellor. A

Dutton hopes that SG, the ad- 

»vising center, and the ,var‘ious.77,,-

deans can work together in limit-, I
ing add-dropping both by students 
and because of University ineffi-1:? -I-1
ciences. on _ ' 

SG feels that the present_ sys-‘Q-5
tem is being abused and that-the_ jfjj
$5- fee can correct only the symp-  
toms of the problem and not the’ 
real causes of add-droppingg, . ,:_,,,,,f:;'

The Liberation Support Movement LSM will
be in Pittsburgh tomorrow to present a program
aimed at "giving a realistic account of what these
liberation ‘forces are doing. what they need. and
to what extent our government supports the im-
perialists who are opposing." said Bruce Pachter.
a representative of one of the groups sponsoring the
program. A

A Canadian group based in Vancouver, LSM, is.
according to Pachter. a member of Pius Third
World Peoples Coalition. '_‘militant about practi-
cally supporting the African movements in-the form
of funds and materials, as well as by explaining
these movements from the African perspective."

The “major difficulty” from LSM’s viewpoint

is there is “so damn little information about these ~

s_truggles,’f in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia

’ (Southwest Africa), Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Guinea,

and South Africa. They are not “really covered.in

LSM, working closely with representatives of

explained, however, that most of.their American
chapters are based in the western part of this coun-
try, though they periodically sponsor programs
such as theone Friday.

Pachter continued that though there is no LSM

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a

Republicans in line, President
Nixon has, promised to get to the
bottom of the Watergate scan-

' dal and continue fighting for his

Not a ‘Laser’ but a ‘Winner,

Presidents most spirited defense
yet of his embattled administra-
tion.

However, planners of the fund-
raising affair conceded the pro-
ceeds and attendance were far
below par and blamed the wid-
ening scandal for cooling off
donors who chipped in record
campaign chests last year.

Nixon warmly praised those who
did turn out Wednesday night.
and said he and the GOP are
still winners.

1) Format, number of copies,
and number of editions should be
determined solely by the editorial
staff of each student publication in
accord with available funds.

2) Any student publication ac-
cused of deliberate discrimination
against any group of students by
race, sex, or academic division
should be given a fair public hear-
ing by the Board of Student Publi-
cations, and only if found guilty
should be subject to allocation
cuts on this ground.

3) Allocations should be avail-
able to anylstudent publication
which can demonstrate a reader-
ship for the number of copies it
proposes to print.

The dinner. which raised mon-
ey for next years Republican
congressional campaigns. had
been expected to bring in $2
million. but the official esti-
mate was that it would "barely
scrape by 1 million."

However. committee officials
confided privately that the pay-
ing attendance might have pro-
duced no more than $750000 to
$800,000 gross and as little as
$600,000 campaign cash.

This would compare to the
$1.3 million minimum raised at

 past off year events, and the 6

Army Sergean)‘ Convicted

WASHINGTON (AP) — A former sergeant major of the Army.‘

convicted on conspiracy charges. testified Tuesday, he helped rake off
hundreds of thousands of dollars from service clubs by wining and
dining anyone who might interfere with or investigate the operation.
-Former Sgt. Major William O. Wooldridge said so many high-
ranking officers knew about thefts from slot machines and kickbacks
in Germany, Vietnam, and the United States that the Army decided to

suppress any investigation.

Wooldridge, along with three other sergeants, agreed to testify
publicly for the first time, pending their sentencing on conspiracy con-
victions by a federal judge in Los Angeles. All pleaded guilty to charges
of conspiracy to defraud the service clubs.

' Nixon Says  

President said. "And let me tell
you. this room is full of the fin-
est steel tonight."

. The crowd gave Nixon a 90-
second standing _ ovation when

-he arrived in the ballroom of a

Washington hotel. and cheered
another 40 seconds when he
stood to speak. '

“I have had, as you know,
political ups and downs during
my 27 years in politics,” Nixon
said. “I have known times when
I wondered if I had any friends.

“I don’t stand here tonight as
a loser,” he added. "We stand
here tonight as winners and we
are going to win again together."

V‘, 1 Here is something to think about:
 Would L. Patrick Gray make a
good FBI director inspite of his
yeryclose ties with the‘ Republi-
can Party? I, like many people.
‘say-no. The reason is simple and
correct. It is dangerous to have
the director of the major police
force of the nation be entrenched
the dealings of amajor political
‘party.

_- Now think of this: Can_Eugene‘
:Coon make a good sheriff inspite
of his close ties (chairman of the
Dernocratic Party of Allegheny

ty_?- The answer is again, no.‘ The
reason is that it is dangerous to
. have the director of the major po-
liceiforce of the county be en-
Vgtrenched in the dealings of. a ma-
- jor political party. -

,-The way I see it, Coon is using
3; taxpayer’s money to strengthen
£9 a weakening Democratic machine
in tliis county. By his present po-
litical-police-patronage complex
he is accomplishing this goal of
jrnachine building. There is little
doubt in my- mind that Coon is in-
spired ‘and led on by Governor

Sheriffs Office, Coonlvs, Freeble Ecologyﬁroupslgnore
The Black Community

by BRO. KABA (David M. Gaston)

There are an abundance of opinions and questions concerning the
subject of ecology. I would like to present to the readers another ques-
tion. Where is the Black community. and why has it been ignored by
the ecology movements? -

think he is a mistake, but I don't
like the people of Allegheny Coun-
ty or my county (Washington; or
any county, Democrats or Repub-
licans, being used by the political
bosses. And that is what is happen-
ing here via Coon‘s use of hack-
ism.

This now brings me to my ma-
jor point of discussion, that is.
how to eliminate the abuses of the
sheriff’s office and how to take
back the power from the bosses
of this county and return it to the
people. The best way‘ to that is by
supporting Coon‘s Democratic op-
ponent, Jerry Freeble. Therea-

‘son I say support Jerry Freebie

is that he is against political pat-
ronage in the sheriff’s office, he
is against using the people of Al-
legheny‘County as pawns in a po-
litical game, but most important
of all is that he is for a -well run
sheriff ’s office.

A Through" the establishment‘ of
Civil Service in_the sheriff’s de-
partment Freeble will be able to
attract qualified, professional

.personnel to work to make the Al- V

legheny County sheriff’s office

second'to none. And as he has ~

said, “As your sheriff, I will run"
the sheriff’s office with firmness

About the Author: I am the
chairman of the College Republi-
cans here at Pitt. I have been a
Republican since. last December
when I changed from the Demo-
cratic Party. I was asked by the
editor of the Pitt News to write
about the upcoming primary and
to give my opinion about the Re-
publican candidates. I decided
not to do this because there are
really no contests to write about i
except’ the mayor's race andl

Specifically, it was the advertisement which i

took up the entire back page of our edition on
May the first. About half of the page is a photo-

graph; under the picture is ;the statement, in rath-

er large _type:’ ‘_‘l\lot all Jews are for Jesus.”
A text follows which states simply that many

'ﬁJewish. students find.Christianity comfortable- .

The people of the Black community are just as. and more so.
alarmed at the distruction of the earth. as any other peoples. Blacks in
this country are forced into a general state of apathy in the area‘of.
finding or_ even contemplating methods of reversing the effects of the
mal—usage and rape of the planet. Blacks are not responsible for the
pollution resulting from waste disposal techniques of the greedy indus-
trial complex. Blacks have no part because they own and manipulate
none of the polluting industries.

Ecology of the ghetto is a term to he laughed at. Because of racial
or economic prejudice, the masses of Blacks could and still live in but
certain areas of a citylwhich are designated “the ghetto.” You cannot
have a clean community if the city refuses to have adequate rubbish
removal. You cannot beblamed if your living quarters are deterior-
ated, if they were over 50 years and before that area of land and com-
munity were open to you. -

The ecology movement is a capitalist movement and has ignored
the Black community entirely. I see this as just another missing piece
in the puzzle of life as whites in positions of industrial power see it.
Economic profit is more important thanithe death of the entire planet.
Black nations are considered underdeveloped until the industrial'na-
tions rape themof not only their naturalresources and culture but
their minds. As these small co/untries nationalize you see the results in
the entire Western“economic structure—devaluation of its money.

Until Jan. 25, the radio I have
was a dust collector, used exclu-
sively to annoy me out of sleep on
the days of early classes. I found
that I could no longer tolerate the
constant drone of so-called "pro-
gressive" rock stations anymore
than I could listen to WIXZ with a
straight face. There had to be
something more I could turn to.

But, since I had no record play-
er at the time, I was at the mer-
cy of airhead DJs, hippy com-
mercials, and music by every
hyped-up hack from Rod Stewart
to the Archies. One day, as I toy-
ed disgusedly with the dial on my
clock radio I stopped suddenly.
"What’s this?" I exclaimed. for
on my quick turn of the dial 1 could
have sworn that I had heard the
strains of Mozart or Beethoven.

Anxiously I turned back and, lo
and behold, music. Real, honest-
to-God music. Here on Pittsburgh
radio—in the daytime yet. Need-
less to say I listened on and found
much to my great pleasure that
WQED had finally risen to the
challenge and had given us
WQED-FM. /

X - The claim can’t be made that
WQED-FM was the first to offer
classical music. KDKA-FM has
had the much appreciated "Class-
ic Nights” concerts for as long as
I can remember. But WQED is
the city’s first attempt to compre-
hensive fine arts programming,

\

  

with not only plenty of good mu-
sic—both jazz and classical (sor-
ry boppers—no Led Zeps). but also
drama, poetry, lectures, and in-
terviews.

The musical offerings range in
space from imported concerts
such as BBC and Radio Nederland
to Pittsburgh Symphony Pre-
views, and in time from “The Age
of the Baroque" to "Brave New
Music." The spoken programs
give us ‘such goodies as "The
Golden Age of Radio“ for nostal-
gia buffs, and plays such as Much
Ado About Nothing and The Im-
portance of Being Earnest (with
all star casts).

In a conversation with station
manager John Sommers, I got a
little inside glimpse into the work-
ings of this enterprise. It started
when the Department of Health,

Education, and Welfare offered -

grants to new non-commercial ra-
dio stations. So, WQED seized the
day and the funds came in.

Also helpful were donations

from Fisher Charitable Trust.’

Howard Heinz Endowment, Bene-
dum Foundation, and others. With
that, a station was ‘launched to
serve the whole Allegheny County
area.

Now that the station is "in full
swing, the problems of polish and
technique are being overcome.
"We want to get a proper sense of
humor, peace, and affability into
the tone of the broadcats," Som-
mers maintains. “Pomposity is

 
   

IWQED-FM Brings Fine Arts to fh

not necessarily part of classical
music".

The effects of this bit of philo-
sophy are shown in such pro-
grams as “Sleepers Awake” and
“Goin’ Home” which feature good
music in a kind of informal atmos-
phere—a little news, a little infor-
mation about the composers and
most important, plenty of unin-
terrupted music.

Even though a very high stan-
dard is already maintained. Som-
mers admits that it‘s still going to
take some time to work out the
bumps. Part and parcel of this
"working out of the bumps" is a
new group of automated machines
which the station has just recent-
ly added.

According to Sommers, this will
allow, a much more skillful job to
be done on the programs because
of the time it will save. Programs

. can be recorded in advance. This

will aid in planning and polishing
the shows and also will allow
more time for live productions.

The audience reactions to
WQED-FM have been quite good.

Lisa Cantini, assistant manager, ’

says that most of the mail they
receive is praising, but occasion-
ally there’ll be a crank, or some-
one who would rather be spared
such programs as “Brave New
Music” or poetry readings.

She quotes one letter as saying.
“WQED-FM turned my crew-cut

husband into a long-haired music

freak,” and anotheryrelated the

story of a harried housewife who
used to have to sit in the kitchen
with her ears plugged while her
kids played rock music. Now, she
keeps the radio turned to WQED-

FM and guards it with a wooden A

spoon.

This months schedule includes
several interesting programs.
May 14 begins a presentation of
the symphonies of Bruckner.
Also", there will be a reading of
Masters Spoon River Anthology.

The biggest undertaking, how-
ever, will be a Wagnerfest fea-
turing the complete _“‘Der Ring
Des Nibelungen.” The four mam-
moth operas will be heard on con-
secutive nights starting May 22
(Wagner’s birthday). For a ‘more
complete schedule, check Renais-
sance Pittsburgh magazine. _

Despite a. general approval of
the station, as of July 1, a budget
must be met in order to keep it
going. Although Sommers has

Thursday, May l0,'.I973—THE PITT 1§iIEws;—-lP’ab,«'gie: 5* I

e Airwaves  

doub_ts that the station would fo_ld H ‘ 
WQED-FM cannot ’ 

completely,
possibly hope to maintain the high
standards of the previous years
without a little outside help.

The special tapes such as BBC_-  
concerts and "Adventures in Good I  
Music” can cost anywhere from

$1,600 to $6,000.

This, friends,
come in. If everyone who read this

article would contribute" just $1.-l,;?_
fine arts radio would certainly be I  
one step closer to finding a per- 
manent home in this city, and 

fewer radios would be dust‘ col-
lectors.

Leon Russell Rocks Arena

by BARBARA GERAUD

. , ,Once hassles with the powers
"that be in the Civic Arena were
.f'resolved“ to partial satisfac-

’ tion, Leon Russell got it together

and put on one of the best shows to

.- hit this city in a long time..

But the show almost got ground-
ed before it could take off. The
0' - opening acts had done their bit:
.the New Grass Revival, from
 is Louisville, Ky., had laid down
p T some of the finest banjo pickin’.
ff  guitar strummin‘ and fiddle saw-
 g in‘ this reporter ever grooved on.

 ‘They have an album out on Star-
, _ date, and if it‘s near as good as

 they are in concert. it’ll be a
smash.

Then came the Reverend Billy
' Henderson (billed as the next
*_ ‘ ,“Prince of Peace”) and the Heav-
 enly Choir, a minister of the
I A Church of God in Christ and four
singers who started in with the
gospel music. This wasn’t your
ordinary revivalist music,“ though
.‘—somehow they made it gospel
rock, and the audience got into
._the'spirit of the evening with Rev.
?Henderson’s pounding honky pi-
ano spurring them onward.

=' ' The came Leon. Looking rather
tired and shaggy, he just walked
on stage—no announcement or
‘acknowledgment that the leader
-was there—he just picked up his
guitar and started playing as if
,he were only another member of
"the group (shades of Eric Clap-
ton! ).
_ - After jamming with the choir
on a couple numbers. Leon head-
ed for his piano and into ""l‘ight-
. rope." ‘That started it. A few cam-
, era ‘freaks had snuck up front as
soon as Leon came on. trying for
pictures of their hero, and with
--this song, hundreds more follow-
‘ed: to take pictures. or just to
boogie in the aisles. getting into
 . the music. . .

  
   

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

But for some strange reason
known only to fire commissioners
and the like, that was a no-no, and -
suddenly, the lights went up and
there was Pat DiCesare and a Mr.
Strong (owner of the Arena?) on
stage, stopping Leon inthe mid-
dle of his song and telling the
crowd that unless they went back
to their seats the ‘show would stop.

The crowd didn’t like that and
neither did Leon. They weren't.
hurting anyone. and were willing
to sit down in the aisles so that
they wouldn't block other peo-
ple‘s view. but that wouldn't satis-
fy the powers that were.

Leon was trying to talk the
crowd down, calling on them to
believe in the power of the Lord
Jesus Christ and to suffer under
this temporary inconvenience
when someone. who thought he
had authority. shut off thepower
to. the stage and Leon‘s micro-
phone went dead.

Looking like he had just been
punched in the gut, Leon slowly
walked off stage and back to the
dressing room. As he stepped off
the platform and down the back
steps, we heard him say to strong,
“Hey, man, I was about to start
the Lord's Prayer.” That was all,
but his slumped shoulders and
puzzled expression said more than
words could.

Somehow. the aisles got cleared
and the power was turned back on.
When Leon came back on. there
was a cheer the likes of which we

‘ haven’t heard in a long time. His

opening words were. "Yea. though
I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death. I will tear no
evil. for Thou artwith me." elic-

« iting even louder applause from

the audience.

_- And after about five minutes.

tions one must suffer through to

JIM BANNER
Meet Coordinator

CINC|NNATI’S Al. LANIER (left) and Pitt's own Bill ‘Rea (right) will renew their rivalry in
both the long and triple iump at the meet. , V

by VINCE DiNARDO

Lfniversity of Pittsburgh head Track coach Jim Banners suc-
cess record speaks for itself. but Banner really isn't that good at
fooling sportswriters.

Banner metliaphorically gave birth to a baby three years ago
and this Friday and Saturday at.Pitt Stadium he will watch his
creation continue maturing—into one of the top invitational track
meets in the East.

His baby. of course. is the Pittsburgh Outdoor Invitational
Track Meet and this weekend will mark the third annual occur-
rance. Wednesday afternoon. as entries finalized confirmation and
the linal preparation for his meet took place. Banner used adjec-'
tives like "hectic." "complicated.” and "tiresome" to describe ally‘
the paperwork. At one point. after answering several phone calls
Banner put his head on his desk pretending eshaustion and the
wrinkles on his forehead seemed to indicate he'd rather be doing
something else. '

Sure, with 31 schools entered—two last minute additions—and
with over 550 individual athletes ‘entered the situation does seem
hectic. But to know Banner is to analyze that under all. those.’
wrinkles and red tape he was saying, “I love it.”

And. why shouldn‘the. , \

Two Olympic gold medalists. one French Olympian. and one
Olympic alternate will grace his meet and every event will be. as
he termed it. "loaded." L ’

Bowling Green's Dave Wottle, who won the gold medal in the
800 meter race at Munich, who is co-holder of the world 800 meter
record, who was the NCAA 880 indoor champion, and who is the
NCAA 1500 meter outdoor champion will make his first appearance
here. Also, Gerald Tinker, who runs for Kent State and who was a
member of the gold medal winning 400 meter relay team in Mun-*_
ich,- will run the 100 and 220 yard dashes at the Pitt invite. Tinker -
has been clocked at 9.1 in the hundred and is also the defending
NCAA indoor 60 yard dash champ.

Jacques Accambray. also of Kent State. who was on the French
Olympic team in Munich. taking 12th place. and who is an NCAA
champion in ,the hamrner throw should be the leading candidate in
that event. Bill Rea. who spends a lot ot'~time in Pittsburgh. is the‘
Olympic alternate. of course.

Thats not all. There are a lot of indications that the meet
will be a totally quantitative one. For instance. the jumping events
should be something to watch. In the high jump. six athletes will -
have the capabilities to soar between the 68" and the 6'10“ mark,
Two of them—Tim Riley and George" Jupin-—will be from Pitt.
Both Riley and Howard Siebert (Fairmont State» have cleared 6‘-
9" to date. Marylands Brian Bazzone has made. 6'9"." Roy Quick ,
(East Carolinai. Bruce Gronveldt (Georgetown; and Jupin all have;
done 6'8“. '

Four long jumpers in the competition have leaped over 24 feet—'
including Rea, who has the longest jumpin the worldto date ‘at.
26’ 4-3/4”-and old rival Al Lanier of Cincinnati. Six triple jumpers‘ «
have done better than 50 feet. I

There will also be eight 3-milers who have done‘ under 14 min-
utes: 12 runners who run the mile between 4:09 and 4:02; 10 six-
milers who run under 30 minutes; Seven Steeplechasers under 9:lQ;_.. .
10 quartermilerswho run between 47.5 and 48.5: and nine 880 men
capable of challenging Wottle. capable of running 1:52 and down.

Wottle has run a 1:472.

A couple of Pitt sophomores have a chance to do a lot for them-
selves in both the 880 and the 440. Rich Jackson 11:50.02 and Chuckg

Mazingo (1:49.8i will face Wottle in the 880. In the 440. Mazingo" 4. I

(47.5: and Jackson (47.8) areyco-favorites. A
l The greatest show of talent ought to come in the 100 yard dash.
There are 19 entries who can run between 9.1 and 9.7.

Trials will begin Friday evening at the Stadium at 6:30. p.m. lg
Further trials will start at 11 a.m. Saturday morning. with fin'als"___
beginning at 2 p.m. Admission will be $1. ~ V

The outstandinglplayer in the meet will receive the Art 'l‘one'r“_
Memorial Award. Toner was a loyal follower of Pitt athletics and
a track timer for 20 years. There will also be a moment of silence
for Toner. '

  
   

OLYMPIC CHAMP|ON_and Gold Medalist Dave Wottle will represent Bowling Green at Pitt

“Joe has been more aggressive in
his last two matches,” said Web-
ster. “He’ll be real tough to beat
the rest of the season if he keeps
it up.”

Second seeded: Joel Hurwitz
says "he’s not playing up to his

potential," according’ to Webster.~

Hurwitz was defeated by George
Collins in two sets, 6-3 and 6-2.

Fourth seeded George Dieffen-
back lost to Bob Clement of Grove
City in two sets, 6-2 and 6-3.
"George had a~bad day," said
Webster. "He just wasn't hitting
the ball properly." ' a.

Bill Wood, fifth seeded Panther,
went three sets to down Ed Dur-
and, 6-4, 2-6, and 6-4. “It was a
heckuva good match the whole
way through,” enthused Webster.
“Bill came-out on top, though.”

Number six Pitt man Mike
Pines also took three sets to edge
his opponent, Bob Henderson, 4-6.
6-1, and 6-3. ‘fMike’s been playing
real good. steady tennis,“ said
Webster. "He has improved more
than anybody. Last year he was
hitting soft shots, content to just
volley, now he mixes his shots.
Mike gives everybody a-battle.
You have to beat him. he never
beats himself."

The last singles match to end
was Tom Current-‘s. The third
seeded Panther had won the first
set. 6-'4, before losing the second.
6-1. He had built up a 4-1 lead, but
several lengthy deuces went the

5

wrong way’, and Chris Brunea of
Grove City bounced back from
match point. Current won the fin-
al set and the match. 7-5.

That set the stage for the dou-
bles, which proved to be Pitt’s
downfall. Current and Dieffen-
bach went down in two sets to C01-
lins and Clement, 6-4 and 6-1. Hur-
witz and Pines edged Larry Weiss
and Henderson in two sets, by
identical scores as the Current-
Dieffenbach match.

That set left everything up to
the Kantor-Wood Brunea-Mease
match.’ It went three sets, but
Grove City prevailed, 6-2, 4-6, and
6-4.,"It was a real thriller," said
Webster. “Almost every deciding
game went into deuce. Kantor and
Wood played well, but just didn‘t
make it.“

Net Notes: The loss left the Pitt
netters with 2-4 record. . . . A total
of four matches have been cancel-
led, including Tuesday’s Califor-
nia match, which was rained out.
. . b. Other rainouts include match-
es with Akron and Indiana.
Most opposing schools are into
finals, so if a match is rained out.
it usually can’t be rescheduled.
. . . Tomorrow’s match with Buck-
nell has been cancelled. The Buck-
nell team asked to have the game
called so that they could prepare
for an upcoming toucnament. . . .
Buckell has promised to return
next year instead. . . . Bucknell
was the most difficultteam re-
maining on the schedule.

 

MIKE PINES’, sixth seeded Panther tennis player, won both his singles

ify Nets Squeaker

and doubles matches Monday,‘although the team was edged by Grove

City, 5-4. Coach Fran Webster calls Pines his most improved player.

ACE PITT hurler DON SIEGLE was kept from a shot at his fourth victory
without a defeat Tuesday when the doubleheader scheduled against Tem-
.ple was rained out. ‘ ‘ .

The Temple squad had journeyed all the way to_ Pittsburgh before
finding out that the field was unplayable. A decision wasn't made until
shortly before game time.

It was the second consecutive rainout, as last Saturday's doublehead-
er at Westminster was also cancelled. The Pitt hitting, which has been at a
record-setting clip, may cool off due to the nine day layoff. Siegle will
get a shot at that fourth win Saturday when Buffalo State visits Pitt for
atwinlsill.

{ones to be able to vote for them.‘The County Board of Elections is making it a bit easier by listing Democratic candidates on a

jythese 15 Democratic candidates. We think they'll do a good job. (It might help to take this ad to the ‘polls with you on
