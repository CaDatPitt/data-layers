New Election Rules

, Under the new proposal, present-
ed to Alumni Council two’ weeks
ago by Chancellor John G. Bow-
man at a special meeting, the Gen-
eral Alumni Association would
nominate a panel of 30 candidates,
from which the Board of Trustees
could elect members to ﬁll its quota
of 15 alumni representatives.

In selecting alumni trustees un-
der the newplan, the Board will be
under no obligation to accept the
nominees of the Alumni Association,
but could re-elect any of its present
members who are designated as
alumni trustees. This method would
be in agreement with the usual prac-
tice of the Board to re-elect mem-
bers at the expiration of their 3-
year terms..,_— . V

Parking Row Proposals

McCand,liss Suggests Cooperation

Althoughjian all-day drizzle and"

consequent; postponement of the
Pittsburgh Pirates’ home opener
prevented a further showdown on
the current University-PAA-City
Engineer parking squabble, several
proposals for clearing the muddle
were offered by L. C. McCandliss,
professor and head of the civil en-
gineering department.

‘ “Complete cooperation on the part
of all people and institutions in-
volved” is the only possible method
of easing the parking dilemma, Mr.
McCand1iss explained. He based his
proposals on comments of students
in his classes on highway work, and
on his personal observations.

Declaring that a parking lot, such
as Ruskin ﬁeld, operated on a proﬁt
basis, would prove inadequate. M1‘.
McCand1iss further pointed out:

“The only thing to do would be
for the Carnegie museum, the Uni-
versity, the PAA, and other insti-
tutions which bring traffic into the
district. to cooperate in some.proj-
ect which would take traffic from

‘ the streets to an underground park-
ing lot or to some special piece of

parking ground to be made availa-
ble to parkers.” _ l A

There are several possible solu-
tions in view, Mr. Mccandliss
stated: “If the charter of Schenley
Park does not forbid, there might
be a parking lot there. Perhaps, if
the city were permitted to buy land
for parking‘, it might buy up some
nearby property, and use it for pub-
lic parking. This would be a deﬁ-
nite step toward the establishing of
better parking conditions.”

Citing the attitude of property
owners affected by the problem Mr.
McCandliss declared: “They (the
property owners) are also justified.
because the constant parking of
day and evening school students de-
cidedly lowers property values.”

In regard to the recent PAA-
University parking embroglio, Mr.
Mc-Candliss said: “Associations
such as the PAA are formed for a
group of businessmen who pay
highly for the privilege of being
members. When they can ﬁnd no
parking facilities. the usefulness of
the organization decreases to a great

. degree.” .

Independents fared more success-

than in previous years, taking four
seats out of the ten which were
open.

I/Vith their strength concentrated
in the Schools of Education, Mines,
and Engineering, the Independents
placed James Bateman, Fred Evans,
Fred Roth, and Mike Sekela in the
men’s group.

Fraternities took all ofﬁces in

Turner Talks
At Community (

  Forum Tonight

Dr. ‘Ralph Turner, former asso-
c~iate professor of history, whose

_, dismissal caused a legislative inves-
. tigation of University affairs, and
the blacklisting of the school by the .

American Association of University
Professors, will speak tonight at
Community forum in Schenleyv high
school at 8:154 o’clock.

Dr. Turner will make his first
public address in Pittsburgh since
he left the University in 1934, at
the forum, discussing “The Meaning
of American Indivdualism.”

His dismissal led to anvi—nvestiga-
tion by a committee of the state leg-
islature into academic freedom and
tenure, and into general adminis-
trative affairs at the University.

This eventually led to the agree-
ment between the Board of Trustees
and the governor of Pennsylvania
which now ﬁgures prominently in
the dispute between the Board aand
the Alumni Association.

At the same time, the American
Association of University Profes-
sors investigated University prac-

tices in the matters of academic

freedom and tenure and blacklisted
the school. .

Dr. Turner is now a staff mem-
ber of Social Security board. He
is the author of a text, “America in
C1iv;i1ization.”

With the internal election last
month of Alvin Ludwig, Donald
Parke, and Harold Byer, the divi-

ents.

Last year fraternity men took ten
of the 12 positions open to election
in Men’s Council, and in 1938 were
successful in capturing all 13 seats
in the organization.

Oﬁicers will be elected by the

Cay 90,’s Skit W/ins Cup

Mechanical Engineers Take Prize

By Fred Lange

Talented students in the depart-
ment of mechanical engineering
who presented ‘- “Pitts-a-poppip,”
adapted from the famous “He1lza-
poppin” of the New York stage,
were awarded the silver cup for
the best stunt at the Engineers’ As-
sociation smoker, held in the Trees
gymnasium Thursday.

“It was the most entertaining
smoker ,I’ve attended since I’ve
been at the University,” says E. A.
Holbrook, dean of the Schools of
Mines and Engineering.

The mechanical engineers’ act in-
cluded a gay nineties quartet, “slick
hair, well costumed, but not old
fashioned;" a dialogue in which an
engineering student was “taken.in”

by some “college boys;’’ and a piano .

accordion selection. .

An originals‘ sketch of Confucius ,

in which the "sayings were “trans-

lated” from Chinese jabbering com— I

prised most of the chemical engi-
neers’ stunt. They also harmonized
in a hill-billy band.

A “war” scene during which E.
Allen Holbrook, E41, was hit in the
face by a custard pie and propagan-
da was thrown by arm and mouth,
featured the industrial engineers’
po;tion of the program.

The chemical engineers presented
a style show with masculine models
parading in feminine attire, accom-
panied by the remarks of a com-
mentator.

The committee of judges who
chose the winner consisted of T. W.
Seabergh, instructor in industrial
engineering; Martin L. Rutter, in-
structor in industrial engineering
and Thomas G. Beckwith, instruc-
for in mechanical engineering.

A department must win three A

years in succession for permanent

possession of the cup.

The Bawdy Politic

By S. F. Ayers
Predictions: 26 out of 30

Second-guessing is an easy t.hing to do when one’sl
predictions don’t turn out to be correct. So we’ll in-
dulge in some second guessing on our own predictions
on the. results of Friday’s election. '

Final score of the rain-soaked balloting was Frater-
nities 19, Independents .11. We predicted a 17-13 vic-
tory. f'or"th'e“ Frarern‘ities. For missing ‘the division of
the assembly by two seats, our only excuse is the rain
which drowned the Independent hopes and made things

M so much easier for the Fraternity party.

On the individual winners of SFA seats, we named
26 out of 30 correctly. We hit nine out of ten of the
senior men, all ﬁve of the senior women, eight out of

ten of the junior men, and four out of five of the‘
‘-‘junior women.

Defeated candidates whom we picked to win were
Rugy Aldisert, Jack Brady, and Marjorie Munroe, In-
dependents, and Bill Donaldson, Sigma Chi. Our choices
were beaten out by Harold Wintner, Sigma Alpha Mu,
Ed Tait, Independent, Bill Lytle, Dent, and Beatrice
Shefﬁer, Alpha Epsilon Phi. Wintner placed tenth in
__the senior men’s group, Lytle and Tait eighth and

-“tenth respectively among the junior men, and Miss

Shefﬂer third among the junior women.

I The Unaffiliated

The folly of placing names on the ballot without
consent of the nominees was demonstrated by the show-
ings of unaffiliated candidates who did not wish t.o run.
Horrible examples were E. Seymour Kerber and An-
drew Brethauer, who from 20th position. on the the ma-
chines, received three and nine votes, respectively. Other

_ candidates-who—were-not-candidates fared little better.

Power-Ho-use Slate . l .
Strongest slate" in the "election was the Fraternity
number one ticket. Backed by Phi Gains, Phi Kaps, Pi
Lams, Thetas, and Tri Delts, the gold card swept into
ofiﬁce with no difiiculty. A factor which aided this vic-
3 tory was the passing of slate cards to members of the
, Band Association by their new president Phi Gam Rudy
Janata, with a plea for support.

Strong houses, good outside support, and a fair share
of good ballot positions brought the gold slate through.
Joe Roberts, Hillard Kreimer, Charlotte Harris, and
Mary Lewis led their class divisions.

ICC, Elections Don’t Mix

SFA candidates can’t stay away from the University
on’election day if they expect to win. This is the sad
truth which four members of Pitt’s Intercollegiate Con-
ference on Government delegation found out this
morning.

Ruby Aldisert, state publicity director for the ICG

; and junior member of SFA this year was beaten, along

with three other Independent condidates—Esther Mar- ‘

 cuson, junior member of SFA, Ralph Kallock, and Ber-
, nadette Blatt. All were in Harrisburg during the
3 election. A

 Fraternity C heck-oﬁ
_ Fraternities instituted an improved check-off system
I t.his»year to insure the party victory. In former elec-
’ tions representatives of each house were stationed out-
side Memorial Hall to check the members as they
came up to vote. This Friday the system was different,
for instead of 12 men working the check-off, member-
- ship lists of each house were prepared and the work was
‘ divided among three people——-two for the men and one
for the women.
Dire threats of punishment for not voting which are
directed at fraternity men each year are usually never
carried out, for fraternity men vote early

Unlucky Second-Termers
Three incumbent members of SFA went down to
defeat in their try for re-election. Rugy Aldisert, In-
. dependent, Bob Heape, Dent, and Esther Marcuson, In-
dependent, were the unlucky second-term candidates.
He-ape’s defeat is explained by the combination of two
— factors: lack of interest in SFA on the part of the Dents
; and the weak slate behind him. With the support of
, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Kappa
? Kappa_Gamma, Heape’s slate—the number four Fra-
: ternity ticket-could place only three out of six can-
 didates.

' Education
Adler Hits University
Liberal Arts Schools

CAMBRIDGE, lVI_ASS.—-—(ACP)—-——Colleges attached to
large universities are failing almost completely to give
their students a liberal education, Mortimer J. Adler,
professor at the University of Chicago, told a meeting
of the Student council’s committee on liberal education
at Harvard university recently.

Adler did not except Chicago from his radical criti-

3' cism of the university-college system, and stated that
7 almost everything for which Chicago is famous, includ-
, ing the survey course system‘, was -an educational failure.
' His attack on the present” set-up hit mainly the, nar-
row and unreal division of subjects into departments,
the bad effects of close relations between the post-
graduate and undergraduate sections on the liberal arts
college,» and the “research” criterion for academic pro-
motion.’ The necessity of earlyand frequent scholarly
.publication was making the supposed teacher a mere
specialist he said. ‘

Claiming that students who ﬁnish the “introductory
general” courses at Chicago have at best a “superﬁcial
indoctrination” in courses’ contents. Adler remarked
that the ﬁve courses advocated by the Student council
to give a"‘common content” to education at Harvard
would turn into reading courses, similar to the St.
John’s “great books” plan, if the ideals back of them
pwere logically followed out. He sees the departmental
system as the chief obstacle to their success.

Adler and Chicago’s president Robert M. Hutchins
both believe strongly in the St. John’s plan of liberal
arts college education. This provides for training in the
complicated arts of reading and writing by a chrono-
logical. study of the so-called “I00 great books” of the
Western world, with laboratory and tutorial work but
almost ‘no lectures. However, both Adler and Hutchins
believe that not morepthan 60 of these books can be
read in their meaning of the word read, in a four-year
‘course of study; C ‘A 1 1 7 ' 0 ‘ -

Monopoly 1

Mayor Scully Names McKay    
To City Civil Service Post

By Georgia Shuset

The city’s Civil Service Commis-
sion became virtually a University
monopoly with the recent appoint-
ment of Dr. Marion K. McKay, pro-
fessor and head of the economics
department, to the group.

Dr. McKay ﬁlls the vacancy of
Ernest C. Reif. The commission
now consists of George M. P. Baird,
’09, president, a former .professor
of English at the University; W. H.
K. McKiarm,id, _g1:aduate of the
School of Dentistry;‘ and Dr. Mc-
Kay, who has been connected with
the economics department of the
University since 1920.

“Our Job Now”

Mayor Cornelius D. Scully in-
formed Dr. McKay of the appoint-
ment during a telephone conversa-
tion on March 29. The economics
professor ﬁlled the position the fol-
lowing week.

Dr. lVlcKay’s position on the
commission requires about two
hours daily for the job of regulat-
ing and improving the civil service
of the cities of the second class in
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania.

“Our chief problem now,” he
stated. “is to extend civil service
into every possible branch of the
city, and to improve conditions of

the se1'vice as much as possible.”

Dr. McKay has been active in
politics in the city for a number of
years, but this is his first appoint.-
ment to an ofﬁcial position in the
administration.
Commissions Duties

The Civil Service Coinmission
has complete charge of all examin-
ations which are given to appli-
(ants for city jobs.’ ' ' i

The group also mak‘es“investiga- .
tions concerning all matters touch- ’

ing the civil serviceact, and has
the power to subpoena and require

the .a‘ttenda"nce of witnesses in relai’

tion to any matter which it has the
power to investigate.

Members of the commission have
the power to re-commend the im-
peachment or retnoval of ofﬁcials
or employees who have been found
guilty of non-performance of their
duty.

Chief Examiner

The group must. make an annual
report to the mayor, showing its
own actions and rules and regula-
tions, and any suggestions it may
have to make with regard to future
operation of the commission.

Miss Genevieve Blatt, a graduate
of the University Law School, sec-
retary and chief examiner of the
Commission makes the list of Uni-
versity members complete. Miss
Blatt was formerly graduate assist-
ant. in political science and coach
of the women’s debating team.

Answers In the Name
Of Common. Sense

Editor, the Pitt News:

I have just read with great inter-
est, but I must confess, with not
much enjoyment, Senator Ziskind’s
article in the April 10 issue of the
News.

His statement, I feel, must be an-
swered in the name of common
sense and a rational, not emotional,
approach to the serious situation we
face today. A

First, says the Senator: “It (the
American public) will see the ﬁgure
of. Herr Hitler . . . strutting across
Europe . . It will see the culture
of FELLOW Britishers and French- ’
men uprooted . .” caps mine).
The Senator takes for granted the
fact that England and 'France——-
wealthiest powers in Western Eu-
rope—are in for a licking at the-
hands of the big bad wolf, who will
then turn his bloody hands and vic-
torious eyes across the Atlantic.

A weak and ever weakening Ger-
man economy, a wrecked German
navy, and, at latest reports show,
a rather unsalutory invasion of
Scandinavia, will hardly be able to
smash the combined force of Eng-
land and France with the ease the
Senator predicts. The Germans will
be in no condition to menace this
continent.

In addition, since when is the
struggle of England—-and her satel-
lite—to keep her tottering empire
in one piece our struggle? Why
MUST we gear ourselves to a war
economy, “serve the credit interests
of England and France . . . trans-
fer title from ships not in use . . .,”
etc.?

'I7‘lan,g_:,’b.est-and only-—-way ‘, for
America "“to keep herself from in-
volvement in this war is to forget

a war economy, forget increased
armaments, and turn the $2,000,000
recommended for naval and mili-
tary expansion to productive use.
/is long as WPA, housing. youth,
and other vital essentials of Amer-
ican life are to be tossed aside for
an economy based on non-produc-
live armaments, just that long will
America he in danger of war.

Out "task is to see that the one-
third of the nation become well-fed,
well-clothed, and well-housed.
When that is accomplissed, we need
have no fear of Americans going to
When that is accomplished, we need
have no fear of the underhand en-
croachment of Fascism on our dem-
ocratic institutions.

The only service America can
serve Europe is to act as a mediator
when the tired nations give up the
armed struggle and turn to the
council table, to ensure the promul-
gation of a just peace; based on
sense and understanding, not ven-
geance and hatred. . ‘,

Europe and the world will s-ee
Peace, and Fascism will die out
only when the peoples of that con-
tinent have the means of attaining
a decent standard of living, and are
given their share of the world’s tre-
mendous resources. Then jealousy,
international hatred, and blatant
nationalism will disappear of their
own dead weight.

It seems to me that the Senator
unconsciously sounds like the
mouthpiece of two groups: The Eng-
lish and French Propaganda Minis-
tries, .and@t,hat group in America
which stands to proﬁt from in-
creased armaments, increased cred-
its to Europe——-even our involve-
ment in war. He certainly does not
sound like the spokesman for the
American people, who wish their
serious domestic diﬁicultiés solved
first, even while hoping f01‘ World
peace.

Common Sense

By “Senator” Ziskind
My dear critics: ’ _

I am becoming quite weary of your trite out.cr_ies
against my outspoken support of Great Britain and
France in the present conﬂict. You seem to think it a
crime to consider the Allies more decent than Hitler.
You seem to think that anyone suggesting indirect help
to the democracies of Europe is obsessed with a crack-
pot notion of European affairs incapable of applying
historical truths to present day events.

Let me say to you, who consider Great Britain and
Hitler one and the same, that your effort to be “broad-
minded” and “historically correct”
is placing you in a position of out-
right absurdity and ignorance. You

En ?:nd.S write to me and you “enlighten” me
iaét of England’s past. You speak of

England’s imperialism, of her dom-

ination of India, of her ﬁghting the
Boers in Africa, of her having resorted to land grabbing
methods just as Germany is doing now. And thus you
admonish me, as if I have been ignorant of these facts,
and seek to put me on the “right track” of reasoning.

Of course I know England’s past. She took over
bacltward lands and incorporated them into her em-
pire. And there were times when her methods were
extremely shady and unscrupulous. Just as, in the past
history of the United States, we too fomented revolu-
tions in South America, seized control of Panama by
overthrowing a duly elected Government. We too took
over San Domingo and Puerto Rico and Nicaragua
with a smuch disregard for the natives’ interests as
have the British in their possessions.

When lands were undeveloped, and wild, naked bar-
barians ran the woods, ‘there was
perfect reason for colonization and
imperialistic drive. Of these lands
Great Britain and the United States
took advantage. But to compare the
actions of these countries with the
onslaughts of Herr Hitler, against
highly cultured peoples and intricately developed so-
cieties, is gross asininity and brazen disregard of truth.

The present day facts are these: Great Britain is a
democracy. She lives up t.o her international obliga-
tions. She obeys agreements, adheres to treaties. Her
subject peoples would prefer her “domination” to that
of -any nation in the world.

Fighting her is a country dominated by a mad man
-—a man not to be trusted, a liar, a hypocrite, Wh0
crushes little countries and takes personal glee in the
sufferings of “non Aryan” peoples.

So you, my critics, ask me why I support Great
Birtain over Germany. 4 , ,

You were the ones who screamed aloud when Great
Britain signed the pact of Munich leaving Czechoslo-

' vakia to the mercy of Hiiilelﬁ You
denonunced Chamberlain for his
“appeasement” policy toward Ger-

Hitler vs.
' Enlightened
Imperialism

For . . .
Right many. You chided Britain for her
Ami Law “weakness” and “inaction.” You

said that Britain was a “tool of the
industrialists who owned property
in Germany and thus refused to ﬁght her.”

Now, When Britain takes a stand to rectify Muf1iCh,
to crush Hitlerism, to preserve the integrity of small
countries, you refuse to see the difference‘ between
Britain and Germany. Certainly Britain is ﬁghting for
her own interests. What nation doesn’t? But at the
same time she is fighting for the interests of you and
me-—for right and law among nations.

She is figh;t.i.n_g, Amy dear critics, the twentieth cen-
tury battle for decency among men! And may God
speed her on to victory! ' ’ ‘ . '

to the double elimination.

Double elimination is the system
used during the touch football sea-
son. Teams are eliminated after
two. defeats. There is a minimum
of time left to complete the mush-
ball schedule because graduation,
as well as the demon exams. loom
in the near future.

Teams Burdened

This week fraternity, indepen-

dent, and engineering leagues will

 adfull schedule to ’

make’ up "the" postpdned games.

If it does not rain today, and if
the fields are not too. muddy, al-
though this may be asking too
much, Phi Delta Theta will meet
Phi Epsilon Pi. at 4 o’clock on
Field. 1. .

These two teams have not en-
gaged in I-19‘ league competition

this year, but due to their last”
year’s records they are two of the >
potential championship threats. Phi .

Delta Theta, second place occu-
pants of last year, are largely an
offensive team paced by sluggers

John Dickinson and Dick Fullerton. L
 Silverberg on Hill _
. The ~»Phi Eps « also .rel»y2.=»main-ly on

their hitting power, paced by clean-
up hitter, A1. Kippen,  Wally.
Hirsch. Jay Silverberg, veteran
pitcher of last year, will probably
take the mound in an attempt for
his first victory.

Interfraternity champions, SAM,

after many postponernents, will try_

for their second crown in a row
when they face the Theta Chi team.
Lou Mendlow, All-Intramural
pitcher, will match strikes with
Theta Chi’s star, Murphy. The game
will be staged on Field 2 at 4
o’clock. '

Delta Tau Delta and Kappa Sir,-
ma should. stage a close battle on
Field 1 at 5 o’clock. Neither team
has played in actual competition
this season.
Phi Gains Favored

Phi Gamma Delta is favored to
win over-the Lambda Chi outﬁt on
Field 2 at 5 o’clock. Lambda Chi
Alpha played one game this season
and lost by a decisive 9-1 score to
the powerful Pi Lam nine.
Gamma. Delta has a veteran team
returning, one which gave the lead-
ers plenty of trouble last year.

Tomorrow the Newman Club and
the Sweepers tangle on Field 2 at 4
o“clock. Newman Club, composed
of basketball and football players,
should prove to be one of the better
teams in the independent loop.
They placed second last year be-
hind the All-Intramural champions,
Gamma Gamma Woos. All of the
Sweepers’ games have been post-
poned and since this is their first
year in competition, little is known
of their ability.

Rainy Weather Curtails
Local Baseball Contests

Mitterling, Frisch Forced to Postpone Home
Diamond Openers Over W7et Wreekend.

;T‘\éi<«}. of Pittsburgh’s. best known

.baseb"all coac‘hes,,  Frankie ‘Frisch"'

of the Pirates and Ralph Mitter-
ling of the Pitt Panthers were
forced to stay indoors with their
teams last Friday as‘ra1ny weather
continued for the third consecutive
day.

The l—"irates were scheduled to
meet the National League champion
Cincinnati Reds in their home open-
er but had to postpone the game
because of wet grounds. Mitter—
ling also was forced to postpone
the plans which. he had regarding
the Indiana State Teachers game.

The Panther mentor had several
new men whom he planned to test
in his search for a dependable ﬁeld-
ing ﬁrst baseman. _,’.l‘hus far Mit-
terling has been "wof*l€iligi '3 chieﬂy
with veterans Guy Guadagnino
and Lefty Drobnuski at the initial
sack. ,

Meanwhile the third base job re-
mains a tossup. Bob Foliart, Grid-

ider'Ernie Bonelli, Larry Katz and

several others have all taken a fling
at the post. However, Foliart has
been switched to short and Bonelli
has also been working with the out-
ﬁelders.

From all present indications,
coach Mitte-rling will probably use
the same team which saw action on
the Southern tour in the coming
home opener April 27 against In-
diana State Teachers. As yet the
starting pitcher has not been named,
but it is believed that either Edgar
Jones or Andy Johnson will be
given the assignlnem.

ERNIE BONELLI
double duty

Reports from Indian_a, Pa., are
consistent in their praise of this
season’s Teacher nine.
the Panthers are a little on the op-
t.oml'.stic side regarding the home
opener since the Pitt team topped
the Indiana squad last year by a
5-4 count.

Following the Indiana game, the
Panthers will be host to the West
Virginia Mountaineers. The Mount-

aineers thus far this year have com-“'

piled an enviable record and should
give the Pitt nine plenty of ‘trouble.

Two games are scheduled be-
tween these nines, both being on the
Stadium diamond. The dates for
the games are May 3 and 4.

This 3 cancellation,

coming late

1 Friday _aft:ei‘no()n, made for a three-
. _day idle‘ period, a very bad situa-

tion for the~Mon"day beforethe Penn
Relays. Strenuous workouts will
be in order for the ];Panther cinder-

men the ﬁrstthree days this week,’

with the famous‘ relay event sched-

uled ‘Friday and Saturday.

The. leading spiked shoe brigade
competing in the country’s greatest
track carnival the last two years,
coach Carl Olson’s runners must de-
fend four titles in Saturday’s test;

It is doubtful whether any team
performance in track could match

the great six-man two day stand of ,-
the Panthers last season, for Pitt’s’

domination last year is .gen_e_rally
regarded as the greatest feat in the
history of track. 

To equal this rriark, Pitt runners
must really perform beyond the
coach’s fondest dreams, for this
week Olson must pick ‘four —-winning
relay teams without “‘-‘’“***W Wood»-
ruff. Last year

ping up perform-

ances i n t h e

It was
Larry, then a sophomore, who pro-
vided the necessary spark to carry
the Panthers over the top. He ran
on three of the title copping four-
somes. I

Also a winner of three watches in
1939, senior Al Ferrara will be in
the thick of the ﬁght for positions
on the 1940 quartets. Finally, the
men who ran third legs on the 1938
and 1939 teams, Al McKee and Bud
Graf respectively, are both on hand
as veteran performers.

Other veteran squadmen, who
will undoubtedly see much service
in the two day event are Del An-
derson and Al Boulanger. Ander-
son must take care of the Woodruﬁ’s
anchor post on the sprint medley
post, the team that retired the tro-
phy last year after winning it three
successive years.

Making their debut as varsity re-
lay men  Franklin ﬁeld, Hap
Stickcl and Bill Carter keep the
furrows on Olson’s brow from deep-
ening too much, for that duo will
certainly strengthen the 440 and
880 sprint teams. Stickel may also
help defend the fourth mile cup.

Gould Plays ‘Boris’ Again

Two Casts to Take Coniedy Roles

Contrary to the title of Pitt Play-
ers’ last production of t_he season,
“You Can’t Take It With You,” Al-

lan Gould, BA43, has taken with
“him the same role in the Players’

production that he had in his grad-

Jlating class. play last-year at-Taylor ' "

All.derd_ie‘V3 high school. .

Gould will play the role of Boris
Kolenle'hov, temperamental Russian
dance director, who gave the word
“conﬁdentially” a new connotation
in the English language.

Other roles will. be double cast,
announces Buell Whitehill, assistant
professor of English and director of
Players, and the two casts will be
seen on the alternate nights of pro-
duction, May 6 and 7, Monday and

Alumlti.

Continued from page one
its present membership virtually in-
tact.

The Alumni Association should
have t.he- right to say whether pres"-
ent trustees who are designated as
alumni ‘trustees shall continue to
represent them on the Board, Mr.
Nicklas has insisted.

Conﬂict Recalled

In the proposal submit.t.ed to
Alumni Council, _the nominating
committee of the Board de-
clared, “In any plan adopted, an
alumni trustee may be continued as
an alumni trustee at the discretion
of the Board. This practice has long
been in effect and has abundantly
proved its value.”

The present method of selection of
alumni trustees, by which 13 men
were nominated in 1937, and two
last year, developed after a conﬂict
between former Governor George H.
Earle and the University, when the
governor threatened to cut off the
University’s appropriation.

If the Alumni Council should re-
ject the new proposal tonight, the
Association will proceed with its
election of 13 alumni nominees to
the Board. of Trustees, according to
Eugene L. Burkhart, alumni secre-
tary‘.

This election has been delayed for
several‘ weeks, while alumni leaders
have been considering the new pro-
posal. Alumni Council has already
chosen 26 candidates for the 13 nom-
inations tolthe Board of Trustees;
names of these candidates have not
yet been announced. ' I
Vacancy Problem

"An important point on which the
General Alumni Association may
come into conflict with the Board
concerns the number of vacancies to
be ﬁlled this year. In 1937, the alum-
ni ﬁlled 13 vacancies on the Board,
and this year the Association is pro-
ceeding with plans for the nomina-
tion of 13 men. But according to the
method of internal classiﬁcation of
members of the Board, the terms of
only nine trustees expire this year.

Election of new trustees will take
place at a meeting of the Board,
scheduled for June 11. Whether the
alumni accept the new plan or con-
tinue their present method of nom-
ination, the names of candidates
must be presented to the Board by
that date.
