ated from high school with highest
honors and received a scholarship to
Pitt. He is a member of the Stu-
dent Chemical and Physics Society,
and the American Chemical Society.

In 1919, the ﬁrst time. the award
was made, Robert E. Corey, in-
structor of chemistry at Cornell, re-
ceived the award. The award was
made in succeeding years to Rus-
sel L. Jenkins, now research chem-
ist, Massachusetts lnstitute of
Technology, 1920; John J. Fitz-
patrick, now of Fries and Fries
Company, Cincinnati, in 1921; Henry
Frank, now at Lingnan University,
Canton, China, 1922; Harold M.
Brenner, B. F. Drakenfeld Com-
pany, Washington, Pa., 1923; Wil-
liam H. Smyers, at present chemist,
Duquesne Slag Company, in 1924;

in chemistry, in 1925; Horace L.

istry, who was awarded the medal
in 1926, and Mildred Tresher, jun-

Early Graduaﬁon

Preceding Commencement

“You know, I really wouldn't have
been graduated so young if my birth-
day didn't come in July and com-
mencement comes in June, see?"
Elizxeth Hamilton, New Castle,
gra ate student in English, says
modestly smiling despite the fact
that’her admirers call her a “prod-
igy.’

Yet Betty is young. With her
twentieth birthday approachin Bet-
ty has completed ‘one year’s udy
in the graduate school, and has not
worked hard because she has heard
that master's degrees are not award-
ed to candidates under twenty-one.

Since her bother ad already
taught her the prime , Betty en-
tered the ﬁrst grade when only four
years old. She graduated from high
school at twelve and ﬁve years later
from Westminster College.

Strange as it may seem Betty was
never a “ ind" she states. While
in high sc ool, she used to fool her
time away so much that she earned
for herself the name “smart-alec."
And because she was such a tiny
child her teachers dismissed her a
half-hour early instead of keeping
her-ﬁtter school.

Taking advantage of the time, Bet-
ty would go, home to “read and rea ."
She used to read everything, not be-
cause she’  it all but because it
was something readable.

stories; fairy tales she “didn’t be-
lieve in"; and only of late has Miss
Hamilton found an interest in “pi-
rate stories.”

Betty's literary interests have con-
tinued. She specialized in English
at Westminster and is continuing
that course at Pitt. Just last week
she was initiated into ‘Quill, national
honorary literary fraternity. Secret-
ly, she is very proud of having held
a newspaper position for a week one
summer when she was just fourteen.
She ‘ways wanted to be a poet even
though her high school principal
said that “people who are too small
to do useful things always decide to
write."

But Betty also admitted an in-
terest in medicine; in fact, some-
times she would like to enter medi-
cal school. Yet, Betty would also
enjoy a visit to Arizona, to own a
horse, and ride over the plains there.
If she knew Spanish she would go
to live in Rio.

When asked if she considered it
generally worthwhile for extremely
young children to go to school, Bet-
ty emphatically said “Nol" She
herself has had to sacriﬁce many so-
cial unctions. “As far as the boys
” she says, “I was not co-edu-
cated.” .

And the only reason that she com-
pleted school soyoung, was that her

parents always  herttqhpiaa

EXT month, together with a hundred thousand others in
this country, you will leave the classroom to take your place
in some business, industry or profession. Fortiﬁed with wise
selection and proper preparation, you should make progress
from the start. But if you choose without due thought, you may
ﬁnd, after months or perhaps yearn, that you have made a

The bond business needs college men. But it requires men
whose vision of business in wide, who perceive its world status,
the relation of finance to industry and its inﬂuence on economic
welfare. It needs men who can meet their fellow men with
poise, yet with a proper sense of service.
There are other desirable qualiﬁcations. Our plmphlet,

present (among whom’ were neither the president nor j

. NE of the most pressing problems fa.cing»th'e
 new councillors, following the regrettable inci-

‘ dents of the recent elections conducted by Stu-
“dent Council, is the method of conducting elections
next year. With only a background of error and nega-

‘ tive-results intheir possession, Student Council next
year will ﬁnd it necessary to begin at the bottom and
plan a-whole new elections scheme, using as much of
thepast experience as willbe beneﬁcial. ’ I _-

' Perhaps, elections would be more carefully conducted
if some plan such as the one given here wereifol-
lowed: .

' Early election of a special elections committee chair-
man by.Student Council, the chairman to pick his own
committees. The chairman should be a senior and his
committee should‘ not consist, if possible, of candidates
or Student‘ Councillors. ' '

 A group of students and some faculty advisers who
know the system of preferential. voting should work to-
gether, carefully planning the whole election program.
__B3llots should be prepared and checked: voting cre-
dentials should be watched ‘much more carefully.
.._All’ voting should be done at one central poll, Me-
inorial Hall perhaps, students from all classes in all
iroting schools going there to cast ballots. This will

.   TONIGHT FOR i.c. A.A.A.A. MEET

Coach Shea ‘Takes Wibecan,
Welch, Gwynn, Pickard
And Knobloch

comrsre on SATURDAY

Coach Frank Shea will take a band
of five Panther track men over the
rods this week-end bound for the I.
C. A. A. A. A. track meet, better

-knownas the intercollegiates, at the

Harvard Bowl, Cambridge, Massa-

— ¢hllS.ettS- The meet, which will be

the ﬁnal gestures»; on the track for
be
staged Saturday and the Pittsburgh
contingent vull hop a train tonight

__ _fo_1_' 'Cambridge.

‘ A_ ‘Captain Gibby Welch, Ken Wibe-
. can-, Don_ Gwynn, Vic Pickard, and
, Ed, Knoblock will ‘represent the Blue

and Gold at the big meet. It is the

‘ ﬁnal opportunity for Welch- and
, Wibecan to make good in the in-

tercollegiate meet, both" graduating
next month. . ~
_ Last year the Panther track team,
which was supposed to place among
the first three ﬁnishers in the l. C.
and ﬁeld champion-
ships 'at Philadelphia, found" the go-

‘ : ing tougher than it had expected and

was only able to grab tenth place
with seven points. These points were
won by ex-Captain Tiny Linn, who
placed second in the_.hammer throw,
and Gibby Welch, who ~-rabbed a
third" place in the discus. Bowen,
Pickard, Roy, Wibecan, and Gwynn,
other Panthers who made the trip
failed to place in their favorite

. events.

The work of Linn and Welch was
very commendable and they showed
the_ form that was consistent with
their season's track work. The fail-

+3‘. '

in the pole vault and hammer throw

was a surprise as well as a keen
‘disappointment to Coach Shea. It

was believed that Gwynn had over-
trained himself, while Pickard had
the hard luck of being temporarily
oil’ form for his three tries-at the
thirteen" foot‘ mark. Besides a new
world record was set in the pole
vault, Sabin Carr of Yale jumping
fourteen, while the second and third
place men jumped thirteen feet, nine
and one-half inches and thirteen
feet, six inches, respectively. Pic-
kard’s best mark of this season was
his jump of 13 feet 1% inches in
the'Carnegie Tech meet.

-Captain Welch, who has been a,

consistent first place winner in the
broad jump, shot put, discus, and

vjavelin, has been concentrating on

the discus, his specialty, this week
and will buck up against Philips of
California who throws the platter
153 feet, Eric Krenz of Stanford who
tosses it 152'feet and Biff Hoffman
of California who has thrown the
discus 157 feet. Gibby’:-:. best throw
is around’ 148 feet.-

Ken Wibecan will compete in the
100 yard dash and the 220 against
such men as‘ Russ Ewing of Cali-
fornia who does the hundred in 10
seconds and the 220 in 22 seconds,
and Russ Sweet and Jim Barber of
the same school, both of whom do
the h_undred in 94-5 seconds and the
220 in 211-5 seconds. Wibbies’ best
time for the 100-yard dash is 9:4
seconds.

Vic Pickard, Canada’s hope in the
pole vault, will carry the Blue and
Gold colors again in the intercol~
legiates. . —

The fifth .man of Coach Shea’s
quintet is Ed Knoblock who will
compete in the 120 high hurdle‘
event. -

Hold Drawings For School? Robert Simpson Will Manage

Tennis Title Fight 
Tonight ‘

The annual revival of the Harry
Seymour Trophy tennis tournament
which starts this week will be a ﬁt-
ting climax to the spring sport sea-
son. The varsity and fresh netters
have but a few matches to play, the
frosh closing this week and the var-
sity a week from Saturday; so the
regular tennis schedule will not in-
terfere with the tournament.

This tournament decides the ten-
nis championship of the University
and usually the best tennis of the
year is played in these matches. Cer-
tainly this year’s tourney will fea-
ture some of the best tennis seen
here this season as the poor weather
has caused the cancellation of the
best matches scheduled this year.
Besides Notre Dame and Tech the
Panthers have received little opposi-
tion thus far on the local courts.

Some ﬁfteen or twenty entries
have been ﬁled and the drawings will
be made tonight. The ﬁrst matches
will be played tomorrow at those
hours which are most convenient to
the players. However once a date has
been scheduled for an elimination
match it will positively not be post-
poned, but the player failing to be
on hand for the match will forfeit
the match. The tournament will
probably go four rounds to the ﬁnals.

Dave O’Loughlin, the present
champion, will defend his title and
will probably be one of the seeded
players since he has won the trophy
twice, in 1925 and last year. Byron
Baur, who won the championship in
the intervening year, will also be a
seeded player. Baur is the favorite
this year because O’Loughlin has
been busy in the medical school and
has had little time for practice. Cap-
tain John 0’Loughlin of thevarsity‘

and should come through with a
creditable showing.

he entire varsity squad is en-
tered and hopes to give the seeded
players a surprising defeat. The
freshmen, too, will turn out a num-
ber of men who doubtless will go
far in the eliminations. It should not
surprise the tennis fans if Jacobs
wins the cup‘ for he has beaten the
in practice
games; should he turn the trick it
will be the first time that a freshman
has won the cup, and also will mean
that Eddie will have a good chance
to place the cup on his mantelpiece
permanently. The cup has to be won
three successive times before it be-
comes thepermanent possession of
the winner. _

The matches will be pla ed on the
stadium courts, and W111 e run off
as quicklyas possible. Each match in
the preliminary rounds willgo to the
winner of two out of three sets. In
the ﬁnal rounds the matches will go
to the man who takes three out of
five sets.

Gentlemen:
I have always wanted to smoke a

my “taste" u , for with each :1 I
got 3 blister tongue. 
One evening, w on looking over a

certain outdoor e. I read that
a certain ﬁshermen could catch more
fish when usin “Ed ewort ,”. so I.
decided I woul ‘ is" tobacco-
for I am no r ﬁs ermsn!

The next sy I tried to secure Edge-
worth. The local coun storekee r
did not have it, so I sent y a trim to
the city for my first Edgeworth. Two
things have he period: I still smoke
Edzeworth, an be local storekeeper
always has a supply. .

I catch fish and never get 2‘: bite’!

‘MEN FROM .
TEAM TO TRY FOR OLYMPICS

 

 -rm. ””“”

Moore, Cswynn, Welch, Wibecan, Bowen, Utterbacl;
Will Compete At Cincinnati In June;
Pickard To Vault For Canada

Six men from the Panther track
squad will forsake the Gold and blue
to try for the Red White and Blue
Olympic team this summer, and one
will deﬁnitely sail under the English
Union Jack. Gus Moore, Don Gwynn,
Vic Pickard, Gibby Welch, Ken
Wibecan, Pete Bowen and Utterback,
all have given their decisions in that
vein, and from the prospects at pres-
ent all will stand good chances.

The sectional tryouts will be held
at Cincinnati, June 22 and 23. The
ﬁnals will follow July 6 and 7 at the
Harvard Stadium in Cambridge,
Mass. Meanwhile, the Decathlon 400
meter dash and 400 meter hurdles
will be run off at the Sesqui Stadium
July 4 and 5, the winners of these
events gaining berths on the Olym-
pic teams. .

Vic Pickard, the only Olympic
trackman now with the Panthers, has
almost a. deﬁnite osition with the
Canadian team. ickard competed
under the British standard in 1924
when he placed in Paris. This year,
Pickard is one of ﬁve men in the en-
tire country that have been vaulting
over thirteen feet, so he should do
even better now than in 1924.

Don ‘Gwynn, one of the best ham-
mer-throw men in the country, will
go out for that event. The Olympic
hammer throw was won by a hurl of
170 feet, and Gwynn’s consistent
heave is 162 feet. In 1927, he was
second in the Senior National Cham-
pionships, thus placing him among
the first of the possible contenders.

Captain Gibby Welch will probably
go out for discus, but he will be
eligible in almost any weight event.
In 1924 the discus throw was won

1

by 151 feet, and Gibby can do 148,

only three feet behmd the record.
lxen Wibecan, ﬂash sprinter of the

Gold and Blue also ranks among the

first of the contenders for Olympic *

fame. Wibecan has clipped off the
100 in 9.4_ seconds, officially, and un-
officially in 9.3. I-Ie held the 220 col-
legiate with a time of 21.2 seconds
until Borah_ surprised _the world last
year by doing 20.9, his only defeat.
However, Wibecan is almost assured
of a berth with the team as Borah
is his only outstanding rival.

Pete Bowen, quarter miler, has the
habit of knocking off 48 seconds in
his run. This is only six tenths of a
second behind Olympic time, as it
was won by 47.4 in 1924.

Utterback and Moore, cub ﬂashes
of this season, stand singular
chances of becoming Olympic men.
Moore is out for the 5,000 and 10,000
meter run, and Utterback for the
hop, step and jump. The 5,000 meter‘
was won in 1924 by a 14 minutes,
thirty second time, and Moore does
a 14, 45. The 10,000 meter was run
in the same meet in a 29-30, and
Moore clips it off in 30-45. Utter-
heck does a 47-foot hop, step and
jump, while the record is ﬁfty feet,
eleven inches. Both men are out-
standing members of the team.

 

One of the best helps to the stu-
dent is a dependable fountain pen.
The Singer Pen & Gift Shop in Jen-
kins Arcade will sell you a pen with
“exchange” privile e so you can be
sure that your han is “ﬁtted.” They
also repair old pens -of all makes.
