The National Transportation
Safety Board is worried about
ﬁre safety on board the cruise
ship used for Pitt’s Semester at
Sea program, the S.S. Universe
Explorer.

James E. Hall, chairman of
the NT SB, said in a press confer-
ence Tuesday that he was “bewil-
dered and concerned” about the
ﬁre safety conditions on board
the ship.

His comments appeared in
yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

In July of 1996, a ﬁre on
board the ship killed 5 crew
members. The cause of the ﬁre is
still under investigation.

According to Ken Service,

Pitt spokesman, the University
was aware of the ﬁre but is not
concerned about the safety of the
students on board.

“The Coast Guard has
reviewed it, and [the boat] meets
all Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)
standards,” Service said.

Lt. Gary Bracken,
spokesman for the Coast Guard,
said that SOLAS is a new set of
fire safety standards that involves
mandatory installation of internal
ﬁre alarms and a sprinkler sys-
tem.

The Universe Explorer’s
safety was questioned when con-
ﬂicting information about
whether or not the ship would be
able to pass the SOLAS stan-
dards, which are set to take action
on Oct. 1, was presented to the
NTSB.

A letter received by the
NTSB from the Coast Guard’s
Marine Safety Center stated that
the Universe Explorer had
“numerous safety ﬂaws and
would require much upgrading,”
including the installation of an
automatic sprinkler system.

However, after receiving
infomiation from the ship’s own-
ers, the Coast Guard decided to v

According to the Post
Gazette article, the Coast Guard
was using partially illegible blue-
prints when it made its original
decision about the sl1ip’s compli-
ance with safety standards.

Lt. Bracken said the
Universe Explorer does not have

standards because the ship is too
young. He went on to say that the
drawings were updated, but they
are still not suﬁicient enough to
allow for the deferral until 2005.

John Tymitz, executive
director of the Semester at Sea,
said that he is not concerned
about safety on the ship.

Scott prepares hot dogs and chicken from his grill.

The hot-clog man's ’Hello’

Street vendor serves up smiles for 15 years

Joy Drzewiecki

For The Pitt News

It’s 8:30 am as Scott pulls up
along Bigelow Boulevard in his ‘85
red deluxe pickup truck

Along wiﬂr his brother—in-law,
he frantically begins to unload the
thing that consumes him seven days a
weelc a hot—dog cart.

In a matter of 15 minutes, the sil-
ver cart with a green—and—white—
striped umbrella rests on the corner.

As soon as the dozen or so
kosher beef dogs begin to grill, Scott
begins his one—man act to sell those
dogs.

Calling out to passers—by and
engaging in casual conversation with
customers, Scott seems like ﬂre hap-
piest man on campus, but he may
really be the shrewdest businessman
on Bigelow Boulevard.

He knows that a friendly face
sells wieners.

Scott refused to discuss his job

until this reporter bought something
fromhim,inthiscase,abottleof
juice. He won’t give his last name no
matter what you offer to buy.

A grirming capitalist, the more
Scott sells, the happier he gets.

‘This is something I chose to
do,” said Scott. “Yes, I see a lot of
people in one day, but I’m not here to
meet people. I’m here to make a liv-
mg.”

One of his ﬁrst customers, a
Chinese woman, walks up to his cart
to buy a drink.

Scott says “Ni hao” —— which
means “hello” in Chinese —— to the
woman.

She looks surprised, but laughs
and says, “Xie xie,” which means
“thank you.”

Scott then spots Bruce Dobler,
an English professor, walking up the
sidewalk, and says, “Hey, how you
doin’ this morning?”

Dobler nods his head and says

hello, but keeps walking.

“You gotta recognize them. They
get a discount,” Scott says, referring
to professors.

Another man walks over to get
change for his dollar bill.

“You gotta buy something, ﬁrst
man, okay?” said Scott.

“Yeah, no problem,” the man
replied with a laugh while picking up
one Tangy Taffy.

“Communication, communica-
tion, communication,” said Scott. “In
order to make a business work, we
need to talk to one another. 'Ihat’s
why I don’t have a sign.”

The majority of Pitt’s faculty and
students are probably familiar with
Scott, “the hot—dog man in front of
Hillrnan Library,” while some are
even more acquainted with his eccen-
tricities.

“Scotty is my man,” said Ross
Dudek, a junior pre-med student.

THE PITT NEWS

After several crashes, Pentagon
orders review of safely procedures

Across the Nation

PITTSBURGH —— Pittsburgh broadcaster
Bill Burns died Tuesday. Burns was a
mainstay at KDKA for many years and
anchored the news in tandem with his
daughter, Patti.

He died at Saint Francis Medical
Center at the age of 84. Burns signed off for
the last time on Jan. 3, 1989. During his
career, he interviewed Ronald Reagan,
Lucille Ball and Harry Truman, among oth-
ers.

FREEHOLD, NJ. — A New Jersey girl
who gave birth at a prom has been indicted
for murder. Authorities said Melissa
Drexler returned to the dance ﬂoor after
giving birth last June. Her son was found in
a trash bag. Prosecutors said Drexler won’t
face the death penalty if convicted.

PENTAGON —— The Armed Forces have
been ordered to review safety procedures
following a number of military plane crash-
es.

The order from Defense Secretary
William Cohen applies to training ﬂights
and does not affect operational ﬂights.

Cohen has sent letters with his instruc-
tions to the civilian leaders of the Army, Air
Force, Navy and Marine Corps.

The move came one day after two Air
National Guard ﬁghters collided oﬂ‘ the
coast of New Jersey.

On Saturday, a C-141 cargo plane
apparently collided with a German military
plane off the coast of Africa. V Nine
Americans and 24 Germans are believed
dead.

Since then, a Navy pilot died in a crash
off Oman; two Marine pilots were killed in

a crash off North Carolina, and a stealth
ﬁghter crashed in a neighborhood near
Baltimore.

Around the World

PARIS —— Trevor Rees-Jones’ parents say
he is recovering quickly from the crash that
killed Princess Diana and can now com-
municate with them.

Rees-J ones has undergone major facial
reconstruction surgery since the Aug. 31
crash. - _

In a statement, Jill and Ernie Rees-
Jones said Trevor can sit up a few hours a
day and has taken his first steps.

_ Investigators have yet to talk with
Rees—Jones, who was the only survivor of
the crash. Among the questions for him is
what role, if any, the paparazzi played in the
crash and whether a second vehicle was
involved -

But ABC, on Tuesday, quoted a hospi-
tal source as saying Rees-J ones remembers

nothing after leaving the hotel.

PROKOSKO, Bosnia — There may have
been several Americans aboard a helicopter
that crashed in Bosnia

Twelve people were killed in the crash, .

including a German who was one of the
senior diplomats stationed in Bosnia.

The U.S. Embassy said several
Americans were on the chopper’s manifest.

At the White House, President Clinton
called the crash “terrible.” He said his
thoughts are with the victims’ families.

Several of the victims worked for the
high representative to Bosnia, who is in
charge of trying to implement peace there.

SEMESTER AT SEA

“The ship has met and passed Coast
Guard and American Bureau of Shipping
regulations,” Tyrnitz said.

Jamie Finch, deputy director of the
Government, Family and Public Aifairs
Department of the NTSB, said that the
report made at yesterday’s meeting will
not be revealed until the results of the
investigation of the July ‘96 ﬁre are in,
which is targeted for sometime in
November.

“If the NTSB determines the Universe
Explorer to be unsafe, we will make rec-
ommendations to the appropriate govem-
mental department or administrative orga-
nization,” Finch said.

According to Service, before the ship
left port this semester, it was equipped
with new ﬁre doors and bulkheads. Also,
the ﬂame resistant insulation was upgrad-
ed. Commodore Cruise Line, the
Hollywood, Fla., company that owns the
Universe Explorer, also added photo-
luminescent emergency escape lighting

FROM PAGE 1

and a C02 extinguisher system.

The ship left for the semester on
Sunday from Vancouver, Canada with 641
students from 205 colleges and universi-
ties, 98 faculty members and their depen-
dants, as well as 202 crew members. There
are 37 Pitt students on board.

The Universe Explorer is scheduled to
make stops in Kobe, Japan; Shanghai,
China; Hong Kong; Ho Chi Minh,
Vietnam; Chennai, India; Suez, Egypt;
Port Said, Egypt; Haita, Isreal; Istanbul,
Turkey; Piraeus, Greece; Casablanca,
Morocco; and the trip ends on Dec. 23 in
Port Everglades, Fla.

Each year the Semester at Sea pro-
gram sends two different 100-day voyages
around the world. Students earn between
12. and 15 credits in classes they take on
board during the trip.

Prices for the Semester at Sea range
from $5,600 to $14,880 for the semester,
depending upon whether the student
chooses to work on board the ship.

Free programs for students’
alcohol and stress problems

Jennifer Stoltz

  
  
     

For The Pitt News

Gnashing your teeth over the
stress created by an l8—credit schedule
and a part-time job? Or are you just
trying to drink these problems away?

If so, you’ll be interested to know
that Student Health Services is offer-
ing courses and seminars to help stu-
dents with these problems, and sever-
al others, in the near future.

Most students aren’t even aware
of these oftentimes free programs,
though.

“They’re entitled to the [health]

services,” said English Professor Tom
Aspell, “but aren’t quite sure that they
exist on campus.”

Freshman Perrin Rogers is among
the hundreds of students who think
that Student Health Services is helpful
but won’t go to it unless they are “sick
or something like that” because they
don’t know about these programs.

Sports nutrition and weight reduc-
tion seminars are coming up in
September and October. Both are free

to Pitt students and usually are popu-

lar. Students who wish to follow up on
the seminars or just want to get more
information can sign up for individual
nutrition consultations with a regis-
tered dietician.

Smokers who want to kick the
habit can enroll in the Q.U.I.T. pro-
gram. They’ll receive a free nicotine-
replacement starter kit, along with
coupons for discounts on products
such as nicotine gum. The program is
an individual venture and is open to
users of all types of tobacco, including

smokeless.

Stress-management workshops
will begin at the end of September,
with each set of workshops consisting
of four sessions. "Workshops cover
relaxation techniques and other topics.
There is no cost for Pitt students to
enroll.

For students trying to recover
from drug or alcohol problems, there
are recovery groups every Friday and
Saturday night in SE58 Forbes Quad.
Any student who wants to stay sober
or who wishes to begin the recovery
process can attend these meetings.
The group’s main focus is to provide
support during such a trying experi-
ence.

Students concerned about their
teeth can attend free dental screenings
at the Dental School on Sept. 29. After
a basic check—up, students who need
treatment or consultations can then
make an appointment. There may be a
cost for any additional services.

Anyone wanting more informa-
tion about any of the offered programs
can call 383-1830 or stop by the
Health Education Office and Resource
Library on the fifth ﬂoor of the
Medical Arts Building.

Shirley Haberman, administrator
in the Health Education Office, said
she feels strongly about the mission to
keep students healthy.

“College shouldn’t be a harming
experience for students, but there’s
always that chance. What we do today
will have huge ramifications on
tomorrow. [Everyone here] feels a
deep commitment to what they do.”

“I’ve been coming here for two years, not
only for a barbecue sandwich, but because
the guy is cool to talk to.”

Scott has been operating his hot-dog
stand for the past 15 years in Pittsburgh, with
the last two years on Bigelow Boulevard.

Everyone knows him, but few know.

anything about him. He says he.doesn’t like
to give out his last name because he “may be
on the most-wanted list.”

Even though Scott knows a business is
to make money, not to socialize, this does
not stop him from saying “What’s up, dad?”
or “How ya doin’ today?” to people passing
by.

He is just as friendly to those who pass
him by as those who swap their hard-eamed

THE PITT NEWS .

One of the customers in line, Kelly
Strotmeyer, a sophomore, says the two-to-
three-minute wait is worth her hot dog and
Pepsi.

“I come here every Tuesday and
Thursday because it’s the quickest and easi-
est thing to eat on my way to class,”
explained Strotrneyer.

John Beverly, a Spanish professor, says
he eats Scott’s hot dogs whenever the mood
strikes him.

“When I walk past, I -sometimes am
taken by the nice smell of the open grill,”
said Beverly.

Even though there are nearby vendors,
including a new couple who sells Oriental
food and hot dogs on Forbes Avenue, who
compete with Scott, he refuses to recognize

cash for his grilled delicacies. the competitive nature of street vendors.

“You need outside
interests,” he added, listing a glass of dark
draft beer as one of his outside interests.

Shortly after that, Scott called over John
Rose, a 73-year-old student and lecturer at
Pitt, and asked him for “a quote on life.”

“Give this girl a quote. She’s looking
for stuﬁ, so you can tell her something
800d,” said Scott.

“The best is yet to come,” said Rose
while shaking Scott’s hand.

“‘The best is yet to come,’” repeated
Scott. “Now how do you like that?”

Scott then pulls out a photocopied news
article about Rose that focuses on his active
lifestyle and how he encourages others to
make the most of their lives. Scott keeps the
copy in his cart whenever he needs some
inspiration.

“See what I mean?” asked Scott. “He’s
73 years old and still looks forward to the
days to come. Life should make you happy.”

Scott says there are no such things as
“bad days,” including the days he has to
shelter himself under his umbrella from the
heat, rain or snow.

“I don’t hate any days,” Scott said with
a look of shock on his face. “How could you
hate any day while you were livir1g?”

Once lunchtime rolls around, though,
Scott puts away the philosophies and talks
kosher dogs, sausages, and chicken to his
customers.

While his brother-in-law walks down
the line forming behind the cart to collect
money, Scott stands behind the grill, slap-
ping the condiments on the sandwiches
before handing them over.

but one day he came
over to check out our sign,” said Haim.
“After that, we say hello to each other.”

So, what happens if Scott runs out of
hot dogs?

“What the heck kind of question is that?
This is a business, and it is not -anything
more than that,” said Scott.

Scott then snagged one reluctant cus-
tomer to come behind the stand to have the
question re-directed toward him.

“Come on now, ask him the question.
Ask him the question and you’ll see what
the answer is to that one. We’ll see what he
has to say,” Scott said while walking to the
other side of the cart to let the man take his
place.

When the customer answered, “Well, I
guess we’d have to shut down,” Scott began
to shake his head.

“Well, I don’t know. Go buy more hot
dogs?” the customer said with an uneasy
laugh, looking at Scott for his response.

“You see?” said Scott. “We have to deal
with reality here. This is a business. What do
most businesses do when they rim out of
something?”

They get some more.

Around 10 p.m., Scott, who rarely
leaves his stand during the day, begins to roll
his cart back into his truck.

Vifrth the purple ﬂower still hanging
from his shirt, he plops into the driver’s seat
with the day’s leftovers beside him

He takes them home to Rocky, his pet
Rottweiler, who will be waiting for a walk
when he gets home.

The next day, it starts all over again.

comedians who performed
Tuesday night in the William Pitt
Union in honor of Homecoming.

       

THE PITT NEWS

Thursday, 18 September 1997 ’

Three comedians kept students roaring

Mike Swanson

Staff Wrlter

What do you get when you mix music,

_ comedy and a room full of Pitt students?

Well, if you attended Tuesday’s come-
dy night, the answer would seem to be
laughs.

Lots of them.

The Comedy Night event was spon-
sored by the Pitt Program Council and held
in the William Pitt Union Ballroom as part
of Pitt’s Homecoming activities. Students
were treated to two hours of comedy from
three comedians — and to top that off,
admission was free.

“We thought it would be a fun, dilTer-
ent event for Homecoming,” said PPC

spokeswoman Ethel
Uy.

The night’s
master of cere-
monies, the “Pope,”
began the show at
8:30 with a few
jokes to warm up the
approximately 150—student audience.

First on stage was comedian Bill
Robbinson, who faced a less—than-
warmed—up audience. However, his come-
dy, which ranged from criminals to sports
to a serial-killer dream team —- complete
with Jeffrey Dahmer leading the lineup -—
soon had the once—dead audience laughing
hysterically.

 

“My job is to warm up the audience -

for everyone else. It’s
tough, but fun,”
Robbinson said.

Following him
was comedian Eddie
Mitchell. After
Robbinson’s warm-
up act, Mitchell had a
more receptive audience, which laughed
uproariously at his parodies of the Bee
Gees, and Michael Bolton doing
Christmas classics. Mitchell also had the
audience in stitches with routines like “the
Mummy meets the Bronx,” in which he
explained how a mummy would likely
ﬁnd himself “cut up, stabbed and
unwrapped” after three days in the chaotic
New York borough.

With the audience almost rolling in the
aisles, headliner Mark Eddie took to the
stage with his own brand of musical com-
edy. Eddie, who can be seen on the local
television show “Datenight,” and who has
opened for acts such as Dennis Miller, par-
odied ‘all types of popular song — from
heavy metal to soft rock. From his opening
number, “Another Dick in the Mall,” a par-
ody of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall,” to his own
version of Don McLean’s “American Pie”
— replete with his own facial expressions
as the comedic punch line — Eddie had the
audience laughing until it hurt.

“I love doing college audiences,”
Eddie said. “'Ihey’re some of the most
fun.”

Eddie’s affection for college audiences
could deﬁnitely be seen in his material.
One song dedicated to his college experi-
ences that really “touched” the audience
was “Maiijuanaville,” a play on one of
Jimmy Buﬁett’s old classics.

Eddie also kept the audience enter-
tained with his predictions for future rock
albums such as Rehab Rock and Rock
Classics You Can’t Understand by Bob
Dylan and Hootie and the Blowﬁsh,
respectively. ’

He closed the show with a big audi-
ence-participation sing-along featuring
popular T.V. theme songs such as "Ihe
Jeffersons” and “The Brady Bunch. He
followed this with an improvised rap song
with some help from the “Pope.” These
were followed by a roar of laughter and
applause from the audience.

After the show, members of the audi-
ence said they were sorry to see the per-
fonners leave.

“We would deﬁnitely come back and
see it again with more people,” said Erin
Harkins, a Pitt student. Her ﬁiends were
quick to agree.

Uy said the PPC would like to have
the comedians back, but she noted that if
the council does so, she would like to see
more students attend than were in last
night’s crowd.

For students who missed Mark Eddie,
he will be headlining at the Funnybone at
Station Square from Dec. 10 to 13. Bill
Robbinson will also be at the Station
Square venue for the rest of this week.

 
Homecoming candy and posters don't come cheap

King and Queen hopefuls spend hundreds of dollars during Homecoming for your vote

Hillary Stevenson

Staff Wrlter

Heather McNeisch’s jaw dropped. The
$14 she was prepared to pay for photo-
copying Homecoming posters at Kinko’s
was actually $100.

Elliot Wolf had a decision to make:
make a car payment this month or pay for
bags of candy to give to voters. He opted
for garnering votes with bags of sweets.

L.J. Werner thought nothing of spend-
ing $20 just for bubbles to blow into the
faces of potential Voters walking through
the Towers courtyard Tuesday afternoon.

The money—is-no-object mentality is
common among those seeking a moment
of glory in the middle of Pitt Stadium,
being crowned Homecoming king or
queen.

“If you believe in yourself and believe
you have something to offer, why wouldn’t
you be willing to pay such costs? It’s about
school spirit,” said senior Aubrey
Coopersmith. “It’s deﬁnitely worth it.”

Despite McNeisch’s error in calculat—-
ing costs, she went ahead and paid for her
posters‘. I

“I was surprised by the costs, but I
went through with it,” McNeisch said.

During a guitar serenade from her
friends, Werner admitted to spending $150
on her campaign.

“Money is money. Ifl have it, I have
it. I heard someone say that one person
spent $500, but rumors are rumors,”
Werner said.

Junior Pat Keating, who worked on
Jeremy Hancher’s campaign, said they also
spent about $150 on posters but realized it
was all a part of the process.

“It’s how people know your name and
will remember our candidate,” said
Keating.

1 Reid Baker, branch manager of the
Kinko’s in Oakland, said it offers ways to
help‘ students defray printing costs.

“We have a 10—percent student dis-
count card. We also take half off of the total
after a hundred copies,” Baker said.

Baker added that Kinko’s has had
more customers than normal in recent
weeks and assumed that some of them
were running for Homecoming king and
queen.

Some students were fortunate enough
to have sponsors handle their campaign
costs.

“I honestly couldn’t begin to tell you
how much I’Ve spent, but I’m grateful I’ve
had my sorority, Delta Zeta, supporting
me,” said junior Elizabeth Goodrich.
“Homecoming is a chance to not only pro-
mote yourself, but the school and the foot-
ball team.”

The Black Action Society, which sup-
ported Ralph Dunniehigh, Jr., did not allo-
cate funds just for Homecoming.

“The money for his ﬂiers and candy

came out of the pockets of members of the
steering committee,” said Aisha Anderson,
president of the Black Action Society.

Some students on the quest for the
crown believe the costs of rrmning are too
high.

“I think the costs have gotten out of
hand. I have to budget all the costs through
working,” said a girl running for
Homecoming queen who wished to remain
anonymous because of sorority rush. She
added that she spent $200 just for pictures
on her posters.

differently if she weren’t graduating this

year.

“I spent $60 just for posters and ended
up with more posters than I needed.
Thankfully, I have student loans so I could
spare the cost,” she said.

Some of those nmning for king or
queen honors wonder if there’s a more
cost-effective way to rim for Homecoming.

“I’ve spent $90 alone in candy. There
has to be a classier way to do things, one
that will save money for us and keep the
campus neater,” said Melissa Blackwood,
a senior.

McNeisch and Wolf suggested having
central locations where posters could be

displayed. This way, the campus isn’t lit-
tered with so many posters, and candidates
can cut down on printing costs.

“It should be about quality and not
quantity,” they agreed. I

Finally, at least one candidate wonders
if spending hundreds of dollars on nothing
more than a title is worth it. 1

‘‘I’ve paid for half of my campaign and
my fraternity has paid for the other half. I
spent more when I ran for student govem-
ment last year,” confessed junior David
Eisenberg. “With student government, you
have more of a chance to make an impact
than you do as Homecoming king.”

Semester at S ship’s

safety should not be neglected

Pitt’s Semester at Sea program is tempting fate.

The National Transportation Safety Board chairman
declared Tuesday that the prograrn’s ﬂoating university, the
S.S. Universe Explorer, may have inadequate ﬁre safety sys-
tems.

With the bad luck that Semester at Sea has had, the
University should be extremely careful with this ship and the
lives aboard it. Every precaution must be taken so that no
lives are put at urmecessary risk.

According to Pitt spokesman Ken Service, the ship
passed all the safety requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard.

But those were old requirements-A new international
treaty has deﬁned new standards for ﬁre safety, which for the
Universe Explorer would include the installation of addition-
al ﬁre detectors and an automatic sprinkler system.

For some reason, the Coast Guard has reversed its earli-
er position that the Universe Explorer will need “much
upgrading” to meet the new requirements. Now the Coast
Guard says that the ship’s systems fall within the guidelines
set forth by the treaty, once a few minor changes have been
made.

The sprinkler system requirement was deferred until
2005, apparently because of an exception made in the treaty
for relatively new ships. _

The ship’s consulting engineer says these minor
upgrades will be completed over the next “period of
months,” which doesn’t sound like it will meet the Oct. 1
deadline set forth by the treaty.

As far as meeting the Coast Guard’s requirements, Pitt
assures us that the Explorer will be up to specs.

But we’re not just interested in what is required of Pitt
We want our fellow students, faculty and everybody else on
that ship to be safe. A ﬁre on the Universe Explorer killed
ﬁve crew members in July 1996. We don’t want to see anoth-
er fatal accident

Pitt should make every eifort to go above and beyond
what is required of it. If an international treaty sets forth new
minimal safety requirements, the ship should be brought up
to those requirements immediately, even if the Coast Guard
has decided to let things slide because of some technicality in
the treaty concerning the age of the ship.

Semester at Sea can be the most educational and enlight-
ening experience students take part in. They shouldn’t have
:_to risk their lives to go.

Professors should not expect
more from students than they give
to students. It’s important, not
only because it’s what we are pay-
ing for, but it also sets an exam-
ple.

It is a well known fact that
several professors try to “weed
out the w ” within the ﬁrst
week of classes by using scare
tactics. As mean as this sounds,
the professors who do this are
usually the ones who I respect the
most; they are simply looking for
students who are willing to work
as hard as they do.

It is also a well-known
fact that several professors spend
50 minutes, three times a week
blabbing about things that are
completely irrelevant to the class.
Then they expect the students to
read everything on their own and

. to somehow pass a test.

Detail is good Detailcan be
helpful in certain classes. But a
drawn-out, 40-minute explana-
tion of the difference between
“short-term memory” and “long-
term memory” is ‘a waste of time
that could be better spent explain-

‘ ing a concept that’s actually com-

plicated. By the end of the term,
the students realize two things:
Even though they went to every
class, they have learned nothing
useful from the professor
(Remember: Attending class is so
damned important at this
University.); and they have had to
rely heavily on the book and/or
TA.
Icanreadforfree.Iarnnot
attending this University and pay-

The Pitt News

ing tuition to read overpriced

books. I expect a lecture that cov-

ers relevant material, not a profes-
sor who was too lazy to organize.

Professors also need to com-
municate with students. In my
experience, I am more motivated
to do well once I have had the
chance to chat with a professor,
because my motivation shifts to a
more personal level. I want that
professor know, “Hey, this is what
you taught me, and I hope you
remember that.”

This summer I took’
“Sensation and Perception” with
Dr. Holland to fulﬁll a general
requirement. After our ﬁrst exam,
I went to him to talk about my
answers on the exam. Instead of
just giving me an answer key and
sending me on my way, he sat
down with me and discussed, for
more than a half hour, all the
questions on the exam. Then he
started asking me about my major
and what I wanted to do with my
life. Psychology is not my major,
and I do not plan on taking any
other classes in the psychology
department, but Dr.‘ Holland did-
n’t seem to be concerned about
that. He was concerned about me,
the strident

On the other hand, if it is
obvious that a professor is not
willing to spend any more time
outside of class time than is nec-
essary, I automatically assume
that students are not worthy of his
valuable time.

For example, I have had sev-
eral professors who do not set
oﬂice hours and see students by
appointment only. Although the
process of getting an appointment
is cumbersome and time—consum-

THE PITT NEWS

Thursday, 18 September 1997

Teachers: Talk with your students

ing, at least appointments are
available.

There are also professors
who only make appointments for
exceptional circumstances.
Otherwise, they communicate
through a teaching assistant.

This is ridiculous.

I understand that professors

‘are busy, but students are busy,

too. Having regular oﬂice hours
would be the most efficient way
to deal with problems. .

Apparently the University
has not figured this out yet,
because when I tried to ﬁnd out if
there was a policy concerning
mandatory office hours for pro-
fessors, nobody knew if one even
exists!

Some departments do have
their own policies, and when I
asked Dr. David Bimbaum, the
chairperson of the Department of
Slavic Languages and Literature,
if he knew of a University-wide
or school-wide policy, he said, “If
there isn’t one, there needs to be.”

Ifl were a professor, I would
take pleasure in answering ques-
tions personally and giving advice
because it seems that direct inter-
action with students would be the
best way to communicate.

The hierarchy that exists at
this University should be broken
down in order to improve stu-

dent/professor communication.»

We all have a at least one com-
mon goal: for students to receive
the best education possible.

Alison Novicki tried very hard to
avoid bashing a few teachers at
Pitt who are very bad, but every-
body probably knowswho they
are, anyway.

to SGB

I do not know who I feel
worse for right now, the SGB, which
has been publicly humiliated by
Anthony “The National Enquirer”
Breznican or the students of this
school who must read in stoic
reserve this so called “Editor—in—
Chief ’s” pompous remarks and one-
sided reports.

I would like to say a few things
on behalf of the SGB. First, if the
allocations board felt so strongly
about the students’ money, why did
they quit? Perhaps there is some-
thing else going on that has not been
said. Second, most of’ the student
body has no idea what the SGB is
or, for that matter, what it does.
Having known SGB members, I
know exactly how much time and
hard work they put in to give the
student body what it has. For exam-
ple, without them we wouldn’t have
had last year’s successful MTV
Choose or Lose campaign, nor the
“Speak Out ' Against Eating
Disorders” program which cost the
students no money at all. SGB co-
sponsored “Take Back the Night”
last year. Many of us also use the
mall shuttles whichlare herebecause
of SGB.

This article shows none of the
positives of the SGB. Instead, it
simply makes the members out to be
hedonistic spend thrifts abusing the
activities fee, not to mention show-
ing Justin DalMolin as an inarticu-
late fool who abuses his title.

I have heard many angered
responses to The Pitt Star, sorry, I
mean The Pitt News, and it is no
wonder why. Last year’s KKK
protest coverage was written in such
a fashion that the protesters were
pictured as animals who should be
put in a cage, which is a very
mediocre play on language, consid-
ering we were all stuck in a cage. It
makes me wonder where The Pitt
News stands on the KKK  how
about you?

In any case, I am writing this as
a warning to all of those who read
The Pitt News and use it as the
basis of their opinions around cam-
pus: DON’T!!!

Todd J. Wonders

It is obvious that Andrea Workman
does not know too much about Pitt
(excuse me, Pittsburgh). What exactly
is she complaining about? She should
be kissing the University’s feet for
even accommodating her and all the
“poor, continually late fools” like her.
If she had met deadlines in the first
place, she wouldn’t have had to show
the entire campus her ignorance.

Andrea «says, “This is the only
room I have seen on campus without
its own sink.” Obviously she hasn’t

been outside Lothrop.

And where is she getting her sta-
tistics? According to the Department
of Housing Services, for the 1997-
1998 semester, the most expensive
room on campus is a single in
Sutherland equipped for the handi-
capped at $1830, which is ‘really close
to her “$2000 or so” assumption. In
fact, the going rate of a Lothrop quad
is $1118, a difference of about $882,
or so. .

Another point of
view on columnist

and SGB  

I think you are all being far, far too
hard on SGB. After all, college is sup-
posed to -train us for the “real world,”
correct? That’s all the SGB is doing
when we viciously accuse them of
spending money unwisely. If they are
to be the politicians of the future, they
have to be well-trained. How can you
expect them to be able to screw over
an entire country if they haven’t prac-
ticed on our school?

And to the poor young woman liv-
ing in a Lothrop lounge (Tuesday-’s

The rooms next to mine have been
empty since the start of the school
year. Tower C, rooms 1221 and 1220.

PiI1’s elevators are as scary as the Demon Drop

Kris Kissel

Oplnlons Editor

The elevators at this
University really bite the ' big
one. A

Most people, I think, have
suffered the Cathedral’s infernal
machines, getting to wait in a
crowded thoroughfare for 10
minutes before going on a slow
ride that stops every three ﬂoors

— which is really armoying '

when you’re on your way to or
from 36 —— even though nobody
even gets on or off at those
stops! And why are only a few
of those elevators running?
There’s at least one that only
one guy with a key gets to ride,
taking his friends to their ﬂoors
but telling everybody else that
it’s a “maintenance elevator.”
Bull.

My personal favorites are in
Thackeray. Most of my classes
are in that building, so I get to
ride those elevators all the time.
Or should I say, “that elevator?”
You see, Thackeray’s elevators
are a lot like the roller coaster at
Kennywood: On opening day,
there are two cars running, but
apparently the electricity costs
too much to keep both running,
because only one works for the
rest of the year.

But the worst have got to be
Benedum’s elevators. You’d

‘think that in the engineering

building, somebody might have
made it their senior project to fix
the damn things. No. Instead,
we have to wait, usually about
15 minutes, to get on the eleva-
tors, and they don’t even work.
Ispent 20 minutes stuck on

one earlier this week.
Somewhere between the second
and third ﬂoors, the tin can start-
ed trembling and shaking, then
convulsing up and down. We
weren’t even sure which way
we were going.

After a few seconds, when
the doors didn’t open, and the
thing still quivered up and down
a bit, we pressed the red emer-
gency call button that was locat-
ed only about four inches from
the ceiling. (I’d hate to have
been short, alone and stuck.)
This struck me as odd, since the
elevators in the Pitt Union have
emergency buttons that are so
ridiculously low that people
bump into them all the time.
(Suggestion: plastic covers for
switches, like the military uses
to prevent the accidental launch
of nuclear warheads.) Now,
when we accidentally bump that
button, we’re usually already off
the elevator before the call is
answered, and everybody jokes
about how they’d hate to be
stuck in there for real and not
get a response.

Well, for some strange rea-
son (I guess the emergency
operator hadn’t gone to lunch
yet that day), our call was
answered within a minute. She
asked, “Are you stuck?”

It was rather amazing, how
16 of us could bond so quickly
that we answered that and every
other question in perfect unison.

After the first 10 minutes,
we heard a woman’s voice out-
side laughing at us. I don’t know
for certain, but it may have been
she who called the campus
police and told them we were

free when, a second later, the
elevator decided to jump up
three ﬂoors and get stuck again.
Of course, she didn’t know we
were stuck again, but she didn’t
know we were free, either, and
we weren’t, so it was really irre-
sponsible for her to call the
police and say we were free.

Anyway, when we called‘
security again a few minutes
later, the operator said in sur-
prise, “What? You’re still there?
We got a call saying you were
out!” I was pissed.

It took another 10 minutes
for them to ﬁnd us. By that time,
the temperature in the tiny room
had gone up at least 10 degrees,
making it a great incubator for
whatever virus was causing my

o . ¢ . . . A ; . u I

cold. (I apologize to any of my

‘fellow hostages who are now

getting colds from being stuck
there with me.)

When they did finally ﬁnd
us, they didn’t let us out. No,
that would have made too much
sense. Instead, they decided to

i try and fix it, with us still in the

friggin’ thing! And it took sever-
al minutes before they realized
they could open the doors and
let us get some fresh air. But it
was probably too late by that
point, anyway: Everybody must
have a cold by now.

With the doors open, we
could have gotten out. The ele-
vator was about three feet below
the sixth ﬂoor, and we could
have climbed out easily. But the

 

security officer wouldn’t let us.
She said, “It’s called ‘liability.”’

I said, “Do you have a god-
damn release I can sign? I want
to get out of here.” No response.

I wonder what would have
happened if I had been vomiting
and convulsing from claustro-
phobia. What does liability say
then? ,

Well, anyway, I’m out now.
It wasn’t that bad being stuck
with those people, because
everybody seemed pretty cool
about it. There was none of the
tension that there ‘might have
been if we’d been stuck with a
really self-important bastard
who kept bitching aloud. But
now that we’re out, I think
someone needs to complain
about the quality of the elevators
that 20,000 students have to ride
each day.

Of course, students are
going to have to risk life and
limb crossing Bigelow against
the light when they’ve got self-
important professors who
demand their being in class on
time for their grades, and they
know that there’s no way the
elevators are going to cooperate.
Ten minutes between classes is
just not enough to get from one
end of campus to the other and
to take two elevator rides along
the way.

I’m not suggesting that
there should be a longer break
between classes.

I just want the damn eleva-
tors to work.

Kris Kissel is particularly fed up
with people who use the eleva-
tors to go one damn ﬂoor.

New West Coast scheme suits Schulters

Ned Schano

Senior Staff Writer

At only _ 5-foot-8,
Dwayne Schulters plays a
monster’s role for the Pitt
offense — catching passes,‘
leading the squad in carries,
blocking in pass protection
and occasionally returning
kickoffs.

The 180—pound senior is

in his second season as the

starting tailback and kick
returner for the Panthers.
The three qualities
Schulters is most known for
are his elusiveness on the
field, his magnanimous
smile —— and his trademark
Band-Aid.

Schulters alternates
between Spider Man,
Sesame Street and

Superman Band-Aids on his
right cheek. He said the tra-
dition started on his high
school team. _
“The Band-Aid is a sign

of ruggedness and it shows

you have heart,” Schulters

said.

Schulters has to play
with heart. Despite his
diminutive size, he is the
focus of Coach Walt Harris’
offense.

He has adapted well to
Harris’ new “West Coast”
offense — a system of
quick passes and draw plays
that requires quick feet and
a quick mind, too.

“The reason Coach’s
system is difficult is
because you have to know a
lot of little details,”

Schulters admitted.

Many Pitt players had
problems adapting to the
complex system. But
Schulters said the team has
grasped the new schemes
especially well during the
season’s first three games.

“We understand the
offense a lot better now,”

' Billy West,

Schulters said. “I picked up
this offense quickly. That’s

what gave me the edge over

the other running backs.”
Running back has been

,what -Coach Harris has

called “the deepest posi-
tion” on the Panther team.
Pitt boasts three solid run-

.ning backs, including 1994

Big East Player of the Year
LaFann
Williams and freshman

Coakley brings attitude, experience to Mad Dog Defense

Rachel Lenzi
Staff Writer

The jump fromijunior-college

‘football to NCAA football can be a

tough leap, but Ernest Coakley
seems to be doing just fine in his
second season with the Panthers.

As of last week’s win over the
Houston Cougars, the 20-year-old
linebacker is second on the team in
tackles with 27, including 24 solo
tackles. His five tackles for a loss

and two sacks tie him for the team _

lead in both categories. Throw in
one pass breakup and two quarter-

 back hurries to boot, and you start to

go from being a good linebacker to a
defensive leader.

“I like to run to the ball and
make the big plays,” Coakley said

5? two days before the Homecoming
1  game against Miami. “Even though
 I’m small for a linebacker, I like to
g prove people wrong with my skill.
7 Size doesn’t matter. It’s the heart
it that matters.”

Head Coach Walt Harris agrees

if with his starter, explaining that
g? Coakley’s size doesn’t hurt his abil-
 ity to play at the Mad Dog Defenseéls

linebacker post. In this
defense, Coakley’s main
duty is pursuit — a job
that Harris believes the
senior is made for.
“Ernest is a runner-
type guy,” said Harris.
“He’s a sideline-to-side-
_line player. We’ve got
him in a position to chase
the ball and . run the
blocks.” ‘
Coakley explained
the rationale behind his
being a sideline-to-
sideline player: “I hus-
tle to the ball, I’ve got
good linebacker speed,
and I want to make the
play.
“And I get the
interviews, too!”
Coakley does-
n’t roam to the spotlight — the spot-
light always ends up shining on him.
In the televised 35-24 win over
Houston, Fox commentators noted
Coakley’s sideline-to-sideline per-
formances and open-field tackles —

offense. ’
But the spotlight isn’t all
that matters to Coakley this
season. He is eager to talk
about the “new atti-
tude” that has spread
throughout the
, football team and
across Oakland.
“It’s a lot of
fun right now,”
he said. “Last
year, we didn’t
celebrate as much

. %9_ things, but this
 3; year we do,

“ T h e

as well.  Everything is clicking for
everyone, on and off the field.”

team’s new attitude and Pitt\’s suc-
cess up to this point to the off-sea-
son coaching changes:

“We have new coaches, and they
make such a big difference from last
year,” he said. “We’ve expected to
do well because of better coaching.
Everybodyhas a better attitude, and
everybody wants to win.”

Walt Harris also wins Coakley’s
approval. -

“What’s great about Walt Harris
is that you can talk to him. He’s a
very open coach, and he’ll listen.
He’s definitely a player’s coach.”

Harris is quick to return the
compliment, praising the line-
backer’s ability to grasp the Mad

Dog scheme and live up to its Mad_

Dog attitude.

“Ernest is definitely a player and
a student of the game,” said_Harris.
“He’s got a great attitude and goes
about his business. He tries to be as
good as he can be.”

Although the 6-foot-2, 210-
pound Coakley didn’t begin playing
football until his sophomore year at
Canarsie High School in Brooklyn,

 
Tale of the Tape sees an upset

 

The numbers of three more Panther
football greats will be retired tonight dur-
ing the halftime of the Pittsburgh-Miami

Hopefully the Panthers also won’t be
retired by then.

Las Vegas predicts this game will be
decided by more than a two-touchdown
margin in favor of the visiting Hunicanes.

Maybe that’s a little more than one
might expect, but take a look at

laying their cash on the Panthers.

Miami leads the series between the
two teams, and the ‘Canes have erased
the Panthers the past eight times they
have met. In fact, Pitt hasn’t been on the
winning side of a contest versus the Coral

V Gables Gang since the national—champi-
- onship season of 1976. That 36-19 win

was the last taste of victory.

Until now?

Wait, wait, wait, there shall be no
premature predictions here about upsets
and bowls and pretty lights and  you
know what I mean.

Yes, Pittsburgh is starting to look
more and more respectable every day, but
changing the uniform and the head coach
isn’t going to resurrect a team in one year.

Miami isn’t the team it was in the

‘80s and early ‘90s, when it contended for ’

the national championship annually. It
has been out-recruited by its neighbors to
the north, Florida and Florida State, over
the past seven or eight years.

Jaunts by its star players in shady
limousines throughout downtown Miami
haven’t helped, either. Head Coach Butch
Davis has had to excuse a select few
members of the team, including wide
receiver Jammi German, for team viola-
tions.

That’s saying a lot for a team that
came dressed in fatigues for the 1987
Fiesta Bowl against Penn State.

Across the board, most football crit-
ics would assume that Miami has the
edge over Pittsburgh in talent by position,
but you know what they say about
“assume.” -

Miami is 1-1 so far this year, includ-
ing a 45-14 season-opening win over

Baylor and "last week’s 23-12 loss at the ‘

hands of Arizona State-

Pittsburgh stands at 2-1 with wins
over Southwest Louisiana and Houston,"
and a loss to an overrated university in
Happy Valley. A

Congratulations! By stumbling upon
this week’s column, not only do you get the
high-quality predictions you’ve come to
expect every week, but as a special bonus,
this week I’ll also help you to determine
this season’s national champions. Such is
the caliber of this week’s match—ups. First
and foremost, the Big Game this week is...

Tennessee (+4) at Florida

Peyton Manning returned to
Tennessee for his senior year to accomplish
one thing: beat the Gators (and maybe win
a national title in the process). Despite what
Florida tackle Mo Collins thinks (he said
“Peyton Manning is highly overra ”),
Manning’s Volunteers can light up the
scoreboard with the best of them.

And Florida just might be the best. The
diﬁerence is on defense. Both teams have
good defenses, but Florida’s has been bet-
ter so far. Manning can take comfort in the
fact that Mo Collins is wrong, but he still is
going to be winless against the Gators.

Moak’s Best Bet still unefeated  

This is the second—biggest game of the
day. The loser of this game can forget about
the national championship. Neither plays in
a conference where going undefeated with-
in the league will atone for a loss this week.

Washington really needs this game
because it has more tough conference
games than does Nebraska. Washington’s
Brock Huard is quietly making a name for
himself as one of the top ﬁve quarterbacks
in the country. Nebraska’s rimning game is
as strong as ever.

The difference again will be in the
defense, where the Huskies are better than
the Huskers.

Washington 28, Nebraska 17 .

Auburn (+5 1/2) at Louisiana State

Normally, this game would be the fea-
ture of the week. I’ve been telling you all
season that this week was loaded, so much
so that this battle of the Tigers is no better
than the third—most-important contest.

Auburn quarterback Dameyune Craig
has a chance to go from being a very good
to a great quarterback this week with a
strong showing at LSU. The bad news for
Auburn is that LSU running back Kevin
Faulk is_expected to return to action this
week. The good news is that even after
Aubum loses this contest, it has a chance to
make and win the SEC championship
game and play on New Year’s Day.

Pitt Panthers downplay their
homecoming showdown

Erlc Mosely

Staff Writer

Homecoming festivities, the jersey-
number retirement of three of Pitt’s all-
time greats and a nationally televised
game against a top 25 opponent —
Thursday’s game against the 21st-ranked
Miami Hurricanes is building up to be a

_ pretty special game, right?

Not really.

According to
senior running back
Dwayne Schulters,
Thursday night’s
conference opener on
ESPN versus the
Hurricanes (1-1) is
no more important
than any other game

probably’won’t get the same result.

The other problem facing the
Panthers is their ability to convert on
third down. In Houston, Pitt was only
one for 11 on third-down conversions.
Pitt can’t afford to go three and out as
often against the Hurricanes as it did
against the Cougars.

“We have to convert on third down,”
Harris asserted. “One
for 11 isn’t going, to
get it done. We also
can’t afford to have
any punts blocked.
That will be tough,
because Miami is as
good as any team in
the country at block-
ing punts. That’s

on Pitt’s schedule. something we have
"‘ T h e to work on.”
Homecoming and Although the
television will help Panthers allowed
us, but it’s just anoth- two backs to rush for
er game for us to ,3 more than 100 yards,
move ahead and v- r  they stepped up sev-

hopefully put another victory in our win

column,” Schulters said.

Schulters did say, however, that last
year’s 45-0 shellacking at Miami left a
bad taste in his mouth, and that he and
the Panthers are looking to deliver some
payback.

“We’re deﬁnitely looking for a little
revenge,” he said. “Last year, their sea-
son was turned around from beating us.
It’s only right that our season will turn
around with a win.”

To beat Miami, though, the Panthers
will need Schulters to _
pound out yardage.
Last week against
Houston, Schulters
was effective, rushing
for 87 yards against a
tough Houston
defense. That kind of
eﬂort, or more, will be
needed to beat 

Senior Billy West
adds another dimen-
sion to Pitt’s running
game, should
Schulters need a
breather. _ .

According to _  
Head Coach Walt Harris, the keys to the
game are the special teams and the run-
ning game.

“We really have to do a better job
with the running game on both sides of
the ball,” Harris said. “We also have to
win the kicking game.”

Last week in Houston, the Panthers
allowed both Kettic Sanford and Vaughn

. Inniss to rush for over 100 yards, but still

managed to win the game. However, if
they can’t hold Miami’s Edgerrin James
and Dyral McMillan this week, they

  
     

eral times to make big plays against the
pass when the game was on the line.
Leading the charge for the Panther
defense was comerback Chiffon Allen,
who was named Big East Defensive
Player of the Week for his last—second
heroics versus Houston.

Pitt will need to make some more
big plays Thursday night if it is to con-
tain Miami quarterback Ryan Clement
and his main target, receiver Magic
Benton.

At least Pitt will get a break from the
heat, which wilted
the team against
Houston. Coach
Harris said the
Panthers are still a
little worn out from
the heat but that they
will be ready for
Miami on Thursday
night. -

Another thing
the Panthers have
going for them is
momentum. They
have received great
leadership from
..  their seniors so far,
and with a win over Southwestern
Louisiana, a close loss at Penn State and
a win in Houston, the Panthers are start-
ing to gain conﬁdence in themselves and
Harris’ new program.

“Offensively, we aren’t as conﬁdent
yet because we are constantly learning
the new system,” Harris said. “That’s our
challenge. We don’t rim a system that is
simple. We’re running a very complex
system, so we’re learning all the time.
That’s the key to a good football team, so
the senior leadership has been huge.”

The devil stopped a Hurricane in
South Florida last Saturday.

Well, not actually the devil, but the
Sun Devils from Arizona State.

The defending Pac-10 champions
upset Miami 23-12 last weekend at the
Orange Bowl — once an intimidating
place for opponents to play. In fact, the
Hurricanes’ last four losses have come
at the Orange Bowl, where they once
won 58 straight games.

The Miami defense struggled in
the game, allowing Sun Devil quarter-
back Ryan Kealy to pass for 239 yards
on 18 of 26 passes. Two Arizona State
running backs, Mike Martin and J.R.
Redmond, also rushed for more than
100 yards and wore down the
Hurricanes. _

Miami dropped to 22nd in the
Associated Press poll following the
loss. Miami,,however, probably won’t
be too scared of Pittsburgh —— the
Hurricanes have won eight straight
games against the Panthers, including
last year’s 45-0 victory at the Orange
Bowl.

Coming into the season, many.

people, including Hurricane Head
Coach Butch Davis, considered Miami
to be the Big East’s finest team and the
conference’s most likely New Year’s

THE PITT NEWS

Day bowl candidate.

The season started well for Miami
with a convincing 45-14 victory over
the outmatched Baylor Bears in Texas.
In that game, Miami was led by
Edgerrin James, who rushed for 120
yards and three touchdowns.

A highly-potent offense is the
Hurricanes’ strength, just as it has been
since the days of Jim Kelly and Vinny
Testaverde. Their balanced offensive
attack should have no problem scoring
points against the Pittsburgh defense,
which gave up 58 points in its last two
contests.

Senior Ryan Clement has been
added to “Quarterback U.” and, last

efficiency last year. He has the poten-
tial to shred the Panther defense as he
did last season, when he passed for 208

yards and three touchdowns.

The Hurricane offense also fea-
tures three explosive wide receivers in
Reggie Wayne, Magic Benton and
Omar Rolle. Rolle leads. the team in
receptions with eight. Miami’s speed
in their receiving corps should present
problems for the Panther secondary.

Running back is the team’s deepest
position. James leads the way with 146
yards this season, and is backed up by
Dyral McMillan and Trent Jones. With
its experienced runners and solid
offensive line, expect Miami to ‘try to
expose Pitt’s run defense early. Last

 

week, Pitt surrendered 271 yards on
the ground.

Miami’s defense is less impressive
than last year’s defense that ranked
12th nationally in yards allowed per
game (276.9). The Hurricane .run
defense has been suspect this year and
allowed 248 yards rushing last week.‘
Its pass defense is stingy, averaging
just 193.5 yards per game.

The ‘Canes defense does, howev-
er, have a penchant for making the big
play. Safety Jeff Popovich and comer-
back Nick Ward both have defensive
touchdowns of over 70 yards this sea-
son.

Senior defensive end Denny
Fortney is the ‘Canes top defender and
has amassed 17 tackles in two games.
He has started 25 consecutive games
and is the top returning tackler from
last season. '

Sophomore linebacker Michael
Smith is a future all-everything
defender, according to experts, and
was voted a pre-season Butkus Award

candidate. He has tremendous speed’

and quickness. Senior CB Duane
Starks controls the secondary and
leads the defense with 22 tackles.
Starks is also a special teams threat.

for 123 yards, including an 85-yard
touchdown.

which really doesn’t mean anything the last
time I checked. But, hey, ESPN is in town,
and we might as well show it a thing or
two.

Last time the “worldwide leader in
sports” did a game from Cardiac Hill, it
was Halloween 1996, and Pitt got a win
over Boston College in a near—empty stadi-
um.

I’d be willing to place a small wager
on the fact that Miami will pose more of a
threat to the Panthers than did the parlay—
happy Eagles.

Miami has always been a team that
loves to go to the air, and it sure won’t
change against the wet—behind—the—ears
Pittsburgh secondary.

John Jenkins does add a lot of experi-
ence to the corps, but the injury bug may
not be totally worked out yet.

D.J. Dinkins is arguably the best ath-
lete on the Panther squad, and his intercep-
tion against Houston last week did save the
go—ahead touchdown, but Miami brings the
likes of Magic Benton and Omar Rolle to
town.

THE PITT NEWS

There is a big difference when you
compare these guys to the underrnarmed
and underused Houston Cougars receiving
corps.

The key to the game will be on the cor-
ners. If the crew of Chuck Brown, Chiffon
Allen, Tray Crayton and Hank Poteat can
slow down senior ‘Cane QB Ryan
Clement, the game should stay close.

On the plus side, Pittsburgh certainly
comes into the contest with the momen-
tum.

A win over favored Houston lifted the
spirits of the team — a team no current
member of which had ever won a game
away from the friendly ‘conﬁnes of Pitt
Stadium.

Miami, which used to be untouchable
in the Orange Bowl, fell at home in front of
a live TV audience to a Jake Plummer—less
Sun Devil team.

I don’t know or care who will walk
away with the Homecoming crown, but
next week Pitt will have more than one
vote in the polls.

Miami at Pittsburgh (+15 1/2)

Is Pitt for real? Maybe we’ll finally
find out tonight. As an upperclassman, I
tend to remember the worst about the
Panther football team — things like the fact
that when Temple came here last year, it
was favored to beat the Panthers.

I won’t deny that Pitt has a chance to
win this game. That doesn’t mean I think it
will. I will say this: Even if Miami plays a
good game (and after last week’s debacle
against Arizona State, you have to think it
will), it’s no Penn State, and Pitt lost to
Penn State by only 17. This game should
be closer.

Michigan State (+2 1/2) at Notre Dame
Notre Dame’s ranking fell harder than
did Humpty Dumpty (from 11th all the
way out of the top 25) after it lost to Purdue
last week and mined the national—champi—

would’ve had. Michigan State, unlike
Notre Dame, is still ranked. So why is it an

This week’s Best Bet:
Florida State at Clemson (+20)

The oddsmakers took all the ﬁm out of
the best bet this week. The No. 16 team in
the country is getting 20 points! At home!

Florida State is the nation’s ﬁfth-
ranked team for a good reason. Several
good reasons, actually, such as its defense,
its coaching, and just about everything else.

But it doesn’t rule the ACC the way it
used to. Games against teams like Clemson
are no longer automatic wins for the
Seminoles. If they don’t realize this, they
will after this game.

After Coezlklfey was named the 
team’s top e ensive player in 1995, e . 0
he earned himself a scholarship to  serles

Pitt. _

But upon arriving in Oakland,
Coakley" immediately noticed the
differences between junior—college
and NCAA football.

“NCAA football is very intense
and more organized,” he explained.
“It’s a whole different level. There’s V , 
a difference in the speed of the ’  -- -- 
game, and there’s more of a set ’
preparation for games.”

Academics haven’t strayed far
from Coakley’s mind, either; he is
currently majoring in administration
of justice and hopes for a career in
federal law enforcement after grad-
uation.

Is the NFL also a possibility?

“My goal right now is to gradu-
ate from college and go from there,”
he says. “I have no NFL aspirations
right now. If it happens, it happens,
but I’m concentrating on this sea-
son.”

A structured academic and ath-
letic schedule, heightened speed and
a higher level of football have not
affected Coakley’s game. If any-
thing, his game has been elevated.
After the 34-17 loss (or “moral vic-
tory”) to Penn State two weeks ago,
he recorded eight tackles and was
named the Panthers’ ABC—TV
Player of the Game. He has started
all three games this season and is
already looking forward to tonight’s
game against Miami.

“Miami is a good. team,”
Coakley said. “We lost to them last
year, but hopefully our defense and
its philosophy will kick in, and
hopefully we’ll play a good game.”

As for the rest of the season, it’s
just a matter of Coakley and his
Panther teammates taking things
game by game and not rushing too
far ahead into the rest of the season.

“We’re trying not to look ahead
to any games, like at Notre Dame or
anything,” he said, “but we’re going
one week at a time and practice hard
for that weekend. Right now the
main goal for myself and everyone
is just to concentrate every week
and to play the season game by
game. It’s my last shot at going to a
bowl game.”

though.”

As the oldest running back,
Schulters has become a mentor to
the_younger backs. Many of the
younger players consulted with him
during training camp to make sure
they were reading the new offense
properly. His dorm room in
Johnstown turned into a miniature
lecture hall, where the younger
players would pick his and Billy
West’s brain for helpful hints.

Schulters displaced West as the
starting tailback in the middle of
last season, and finished the season
with 555 yards rushing, second

sure all aspects of the team were
running smoothly. Pitt added a new
athletics director, a new head
coach, new colors and even a new
name, “Pittsburgh” instead of
“Pitt.”

Schulters said he thinks all the
changes have had a positive impres—
sion on the players.

“There has definitely been an
attitude change,” Schulters said.
“There has been more hustle and
more intense practices because
everyone wants to play.”

Hopefully the improvements on
the practice field will translate into
more wins.

“Change is good,” Schulters
said. “Sometimes change is for the
better.”
