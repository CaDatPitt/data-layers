  Swanson
School
receives
$22
million 2
grant

- By Aaron Stier-Cohen
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Swanson School of Engi-
neering received a $22 million
grant — one of the largest private

foundation grants in Pitt’s history‘ -

— to help the school become a
national center for energy and_
research development.

On Thursday, the Richard King
Mellon Foundation_awarded the
grant to Pitt, which will be pay-
able over three years, in order to
create a strong center for energy
research and development in the
surrounding Pittsburgh area. '

5‘The level of our investment ’

reflects our conﬁdence in the aca-
demic and administrative leader-
ship of the University,” said Scott
I'zzo, director of the Richard King
Mellon Foundation, in a press re-
lease. “The center has tremen'-
dous potential to "make an impact
in Pittsburgh, as energy will-be
the major driver of our regional
economy for years to come.”

At a press conference Thurs-

day afternoon, Chancellor Mark‘

Nordenberg thanked the founda-

tion for its grant and expressed

hope that this money will help

attract talented new staff and

students to the Center for En-

ergy in Pitt’s Swanson School of‘
Engineering, which was created

in 2008. '

“With this historic gift 
we now are positioned to more
quickly  reach ever-higher lev-
els of impact and stature for both
our center for energy and for the
region,” he said. ~

Gerald Holder, U.S. Steel Dean

of Engineering, further outlined A

Gammage Project dehutsat Henryﬂeymannlheatre

By Nate Kreichman
For The Pitt News

On Oct. 12, 1995, police pulled overa
31-year-old black man namedjonny
Garmnage on Route 51 in Brentwood,
a suburban community south of
Pittsburgh. 1 ‘

It should have been a routine
traffic stop, but less than 10 minutes
later, Gammage was dead.

Now, 15 years later, Attilio Fa-
vorini, the founding chair of Pitt’s
Department of Theatre Arts, the
Pitt Repertory Theatre and the
Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre
Company, are staging Fav0rini’s

' play, “The Gammage Project,” to il-

luminate the events surrounding the
man’s death. _ ‘ .
The play debuted Thursday at the
Henry Heymann Theatre and will
run through Feb. 19, with additional
performances held from March 2 to 4

at the August Wilson Center. Tickets
run from $12 to $25. After each per-
formance — except opening night
— there will be a talk back, during
which audience members can speak
with some of the real people depicted
in the play. p

Pitt administration of justice

‘ professor Wayne Babish was Brent-

wood’s chief of police at the time of
Gammage’s death and said he still
carries, the guilt of the 

“This was a guy that died while I
was police chief,” Babish said. “That’s
something I’ve had to live with every
day since.” ' l

Babish will attend the talk back
sessions on Feb. 12 and Feb. 15.

Brentwood police Lt. Milton
Mulholland pulled Gammage over
and was joined by four white ofﬁ-
cers from three jurisdictions. The

circumstances surrounding why,

Gammage was pulled over remain
a source of controversy, but at the

time, nobody had reason to think
it would be anything more than a
routine trafﬁc stop. '
Each officer told variations of the
event at the coroner’s inquest, the

onlylegalproceedingforwhichthey '

were required to testify. There are -
different versions of why Gammage _
was pulled over. His registration was
expired, but that would have been
hard to see. Hemight have been driv-

ing erratically-, but no one will ever

know for sure because there were
no cameras. -

What’s certain is this: After pull-
ing Gammage over as part of a rou-
tine traffic stop, officers asked him
to step out of the car, and a struggle
ensued. After minutes of struggling,
ﬁve officers brought Gammage down
to pavement from which he .would
never rise. ‘ » .

. The coroner said Gammage died
of positional asphyxia, or suffoca-
tion caused by pressure the officers

placed on  back and neck while he
' was in the face—down position.

j Favorini said he’d wanted to write
the play, which he dubbed a docu-
drama, from the moment the case
occurred. _
Between 80 and 85 percent of
the play is made up of what Favorini
called “found dialogue,” carved out
of quotes from newspaper articles,
interviews he conducted and 8,000
pages of court transcripts. The re-
search and writing took Favorini
more than two years to complete.
He said the challenge was to “boil

_ it down into something that could be

dramatic and somehow capture all of

-the complexities of the story.”

The playwright made no pretense
at objectivity, calling it f‘a kind‘ of
myth that we construct.” Instead,
he said he “tried to. let the facts take

. [him] where they wanted to.”

Rep. Frankel Stalks funding, civil rightsover pancakes  

Rep. Frankel discusses the importance‘ of funding educationfand protecting gay rights over Pa.mel_a’s hotcalces on Thursday: 3

By Gretchen Andersen
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Pittsburgh,
reassured students that their advo-
cacy last year helped decrease Gov.
Tom Corbett’s 50 percent proposed

cuts to higher education by more ’

than half.

And this year he thinks students’
can do the same.

“I understand how importantthis
University is with the re—emergence
of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh’s
economic vitality. The University of
Pittsburgh serves as an economic
engine by creating jobs and helping
transform oureconomy,” Frankel said
to students.

Frankel’s remarks were part of-

this year’s ﬁrst Pancakes and Poli-
tics, a lecture and Q&A session with
students, politicians and Pamela’s
pancakes. About 40 graduate and
undergraduate students attended the
hour—long event Thursday morning
in the O’Hara Student Center din-
ing room. The Graduate and Profes-
sional Student Assembly and Student
Government Board co-sponsored the
event. .

Frankel, chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus, is a Common-
wealth Trustee for Pitt. During the
morning breakfast, he spoke about

several different issues pertinent to A
him, including LGBTQ rights, Port‘
Authority cuts, Marcellus Shale and ‘

Corbett’s recently proposed budget
—— especially the 30 percent proposed
cut to the University’s state funding.
Frankel said higher education
had been “shortchanged” even be-
fore Corbett’s 2010-11 budget. He
noted how the ‘state legislature and
former Pennsylvania governors Ed
Rendell and Tom Ridge “haven’tbeen
incréasingtheir investment in higher
education.”
He said that University officials
and students resisted last year’s cuts
by holding rallies, such as Pitt Day

in Harrisburg, and communicating ‘

with the legislature. Though Corbett
initially proposed halvingthe general
appropriations to higher education,

the ﬁnal budget only cut 19 percent.
Highlighting education cuts in
other areas of the budget, Frankel
said the cuts are “dismantling pub-
lic education,” beyond just universi-
ties. _
“School districts can’t absorb a

' billion dollars in cuts. They are cut-_ 1

ting faculty, increasing classroom
sizes, early elementary child pro-

grams, arts and athletic programs,”

Frankel said. 3 g _

Frankel also took the time to talk
about civil rights ——- an issue that has
been popular around campus recently
with regard to Pitt’s lack of transgen-
der housing. 1

He noted that Pennsylvania is one
of the only states that doesn’t provide
civil rights protection for workplace
discrimination to the LGBTQ com-
munity, which he said is an embar-
rassment and could make the state
less appealing to employers.

“We see across the country, and
corporations — almost every For-
tune 500 company in their corporate’
bylaws states you can’tdiscriminate
because of gender identity and sexual
orientation,” he said.

SGB memberjulie Hallinan said
she enjoyed learning about Frankel’s
efforts with the LGBTQ community.
Hallinan hopes to work with Frankel
intryingto get the administration to
provide transgender housing.

GPSA president Nyasha Hun-
gwe said he too was impressed with
Frankel’s discussion on civil rights
issues. '.

“There are fundamental ‘differ-
ences between Republicans and Dem-
ocrats, butwhenwe are talking about
civil rights, we are talking aboutwhat
makes us people,” Hungwe said.

Thomas Cunningham, aGPSA ad-

n ministrative assistant, said Frankel’s

talk was honest but depressing.

“He elaborated on problems fac-
ing University students but didn’t of-
fer concrete solutions for changing
the current administrat_ion’s relation-
ship with the University,” Cunning-
ham said.

Hungwe said the next Pancakes
and Politics will be Feb. 23 with Rep.
Jaret Gibbons, D—Lawrence. I

Nordenbergpqinted to Pitt
alumni in attendance like John
Swanson, after whom the engi-

lustrate Pitt’s role in training
highly skilled engineers who
contribute to the regional and
national economy. Since 1997,
Pitt’s school of engineering has
increased its number of graduates
by 75 percent.

At the conference, Norden-
berg also took time toaddress the

recent state budget cut proposals .

that will soon affect Pitt, refuting
claims that grants such as this are

evidence that Pitt does not need‘

government money. V
“We really are in it together,”

cut] is along-term bad strategy

Gammage had nojcrirninal recor A H

and had been president of the gospel
choir at the State University of New
York at Buffalo. Trace amounts of
alcohol were found in his blood and
toxicology reports did not indicate
drug use. - r _, * ’

_ ' Both Favorini and Brett Caﬂier,
who plays three characters in the
production, said Gammage had been

, guilty of just one thing: driving while

black.

Mulholland and two other offi-

' cers,MichaelAlbert and]ohnVojtas,

faced charges of involuntary man-
slaughter.

Sgt. Keith Henderson, another
involved officer, was not indicted and
appeared to be the prosecution’s best
witness based on his testimony at
the coroner’s inquest. Favorini said
things changed when Henderson
refused to repeat his statements ——
which could have been damning to
the officers in open court.

The abrupt turnaround is an
example of what Babish called the
“thin blue line,” a mentality pervasive
amongpolice that they _1nustbackfel-
low officers regardless of the facts.

Babish said he refused to play

. i along. Hetestiﬁed and spoke openly
in what [Favorini’s] doing and how '

about the incident and was forced
to resign as a result. He said that he
was forced to step down because the
borough council thought he wasn’t

“doing enough to protect his offi-

cers and brought undue attention
to Brentwood by speaking with the

‘media. Babish conﬁrmed thathisrole
as police chief was to protect people, _

not other ofﬁcers.

“I’m not goingto jail forthem. I’m
not going to .lie for anybody. I don’t
care where it falls,” he said. “That’s
what happens when you take on a
leadership role. You’re either going
to be a leader, or you’re going to go

along with the easy way, and that’s to

' tryto puta spin on things orprovide
false information.”

Vojtas was acquitted by an all-

white jury in 1996, was promoted

the following year and remains on
the force tothis day.

Mulholland and Albert were
subject to two mistrials. The second
jury was made up of 1-1 whites and a
single black juror. The black juror
was the lone holdout preventing ac-
quittal, but he was no Henry Fonda
and these no “12 Angry Men.” The
case ended in deadlock, and a judge
ruled the officers could not be tried
a third time. ‘

Babish said he holds no grudges
because the termination opened
the door to his teaching career. He
credited his supervisor, professor
Lee Weinberg, for giving him the op-
portunity. ,

“When he offeredme this job, he

felt that that’s why I should teach our‘

students. I should teach them right
from wrong and the  to- become
a leader and agood manager,” he
said. '

Gammage’s death brought un-

‘ precedented change. Babish said

that police forces nationwide are now
trained to place handcuffed suspects
in a sitting or standing position to
avoid asphyxia. '

Additionally, the Department of

Justice launched an investigation that
led to the city signing aﬁve—year con-

' sent decree mandating federal over-

sight of the training and discipline
of its police in 1997. A referendum
to create the Citizens Police Review
Board in Pittsburgh was passed the
same year. The agency investigates
complaints of police misconduct.
Babish praised the work, saying he
hopes to see new legislation to give
the Board more legal authority.
Favorini noted that while prog-
ress has been made, it is “beginning
to erode before our eyes,” pointing
to a 2010 case in which three white
police ofﬁcers severely beat a black
teenager, Jordan Miles. Babish and
Caffier echoed the sentiment, noting
the expanded police authority fol-
lowing Sept. 11 and the events of the
2009 G-20 Summit respectively.

. “Once the person’s gone, it’s up
to us to make sense of it. We can ei-
ther let it affect our lives, we can let
it change something in society, or
we can pick up the rug and shove it
under, and Ithink forawhile people
didn’t want to shove it under the rug
anymore,” Favorini said.

Favorini said he hopes his play
will make people remember.

“You can’t change history, you —

can’t bringjonny Gammage back to
life,” he said. “So all you can do is
change people’s minds.” I

Last week, I committed the car— ‘
dinal sin of newspaper writing:
I missed a deadline. To be pre-
cise, »I missed a deadline that
had already been extended
twice due to a small depressive
episode. Someof my reasons for
missing the deadline, like that
depressive episode, werevalid.
Some, like a stubborn convic-
tion that affirmative action was
an issue that merited a better
column than I could write in my
uninspired state, were flimsy
cop outs.

Absolutely nothing, however,
could excuse what I did next,
yvhich was avoid my editor’s
phone calls for 24 hours.

I didn’t do it to be a jerk,
although it was absolutely a
jerk thing to "do. More to the
point, I didn’t do itfout of ap-
athy, or because I didn’t care
about the ‘trouble I was caus-
ing by failing to be in contact.
But having already squandered
my editor’s good will past two

couldn’t even think about the

about what a lazy, incompetent,

when you’ve procrastinated on
something or simply not done
it, is to avoid the issue by, say,
dodging your editor’s phone
calls or skipping three weeks
of class. i .
Knowing you’re not alone is

‘ comforting, but it doesn’t pull
up your GPA, so let’s cut to the

chase: How the hell do you stop
letting avoidance make your life
more difficult?

 

Write ascript. It’_s cliche, it’s
stupid, but it’s necessary — at
least for me. This is for banish-

ing that feeling of“I don’t even

know what to say to them.” It
doesn’t have to be a great script.
It doesn’t have to be a valid ex-
cuse or a heartwarming story.
You can write down, “I don’t
know why I didn’t do my home-
work, I was just really tired, I’ll
get it together for next time”
on a piece of paper and say it

recruit a friend. My boyfriend
does this for me: I tell him what
I’m avoiding and he helps me

Panthers hope

"'74

By Brian Batko
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s basketball team’

traveled to Florida on Tuesday with
a mission to ﬁrmly entrench itself
as an NCAA Tournament-worthy
team. Instead, the Panthers left
the Sunshine State with an ugly
loss to South Florida and another
blemish on their resume.

_ As Ashton Gibbs, Travon Wood-
all and the rest of the team endured
a brutal 63-51 defeat at the hands
of South Florida Wednesday night
that snapped their four—game win-
ning streak, the Seton Hall Pirates
topped Rutgers to halt a devastat-
ing six-game losing streak. "

Fortunately for the Panthers,
Seton Hall — a team they will
face on the road at noon on Sun-
day .— doesn’t bear much of a
resemblance to the South Florida
team that terrorized them on the
interior Wednesday night.

Unlike the South Florida Bulls,
Seton Hall only has one player with
size, athleticism and experience
down low: Western Pennsylvania
native Herb Pope. _

Pope, who played high school
‘ball about 45 minutes north of
Pittsburgh at Aliquippa High
School, is averaging a double-

Pitt still searching
for answers

The Panthers haue lost nine straight games.

Byjasper Wilson
Staﬁ” Writer

In the midst of a nine-game losing
streak, the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team continues to search for
answers.

The Panthers have had a week

off since their last game — a 72-48
loss to Marquette'— to reﬂect on
their poor form. Pitt hasn’t won
a game in 2012 and while a few
games have been competitive, the
majority of the Panthers’ losses
haven’t been close. Pitt’s average
margin of de-

on sophomore Asia Logan’s shoul-
der injury is grim.

As of Wednesday, Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said Lo-
gan, who didn’t play Saturday at
Marquette, hadn’t been cleared to
practice since the injury onjan. 31
and won’t see time in Cincinnati.
She’s listed as day-to-day, and Be-
renato said she believes Logan will
be out for the season.

While Pitt’s players said they
believe they are playing solid de-
fense, Pitt leads the Big East in
points allowed at 70.1 per game.
Berenato said that the team’s in-
ability to con-

feat during the

has been 22

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN‘

Syracusestays on top

By R] Sepich
Stajfwriter

With several teams playing their

' best basketball of the season and

poised to make a run for the con-

ference title, the Big East men’s -

basketball standings havebecome
an ever-changing entity.

Pitt’s disappointing loss at
South Florida on Wednesday not
only ended the Panthers’ four-
game winning streak, but the de-
feat also keeps Pitt out of the top
half of my Big East standings.

Meanwhile, at the front of the
pack, a familiar squad remains on
top, but there’s an anxious group
of teams looking to narrow the gap
on the leaders.

‘ My weekly power rankings of
all 16 teams in the conference lay
out which teams are trending up-
ward and which teams are falling
into the Big East abyss.

1. Syracuse —_— It took overtime
on Wednesday night, but the Or-
ange (24—1, 11-1 Big East) solidiﬁed

_, their position at the top of the Big
" East standings with ahard-fought

victory over Georgetown. With Fab
Melo’s academic issues resolved
and the star sophomore center
back in the lineup, Syracuse is set
to coast through its remaining six
conference games and clinch the
Big East regular season title, as
well as No. 1 seeds in both the Big

East Tournament and the NCAA

Tournament.

,2. Notre Dame — The Fighting
Irish (16-8, 8-3 Big East) handed
Syracuse its only conference loss
_and are currently riding an impres-
sive ﬁve-game winning streak, so
Notre Dame ‘might be the only
team in the Big East that can catch

' l the Orange. Two more tough wins

this week over Marquette and West
Virginia legitimized Notre Dame
as a contender in the conference,
which is all the more impressive
when you consider the Irish have
played the majority of this season
without their best player and lead-
ing scorer Tim Abromaitis.

3. Marquette —— The Irish’s

victory over Marquette‘ this week
ﬁnally ended the Golden Eagles’
“ (19-4, 9-3 Big East) seven—game
winning streak. However, thanks
to senior guard Darius Johnson-
O_dotn’s 23‘ points, head coach

Buzz Williams’ team didn’t take
long.to get back in the win column.
Marquette fans hope that Monday
night’s solid, double-digit-victory

at DePaul will be the beginning of —

a new winning streak for their
team. ‘

4. Georgetown — The Hoyas (18—5,
8-4 Big East) concluded a nearly
perfect week with an upset victory
at Syracuse on Wednesday night. A
dominating 30-point win against
South Florida made a statement

. to the rest of the Big East that

Georgetown has enough talent to
win big, but the overtime defeat to
the Orange robbed the Hoyas of a
much-needed signature win. With
four straight games against oppo-
nents at the bottom of the'confer-
ence standings coming up on the
schedule, Georgetown should have
no trouble rebounding from the
disappointment.

5. Louisville — As another team
quickly_climbing up the Big East

standings, the Cardinals’ (19-5,.

7-4 Big East) dominating perfor-
mances in their current ﬁve-game
winning streak have the rest of the
conference on alert. Head coach
Rick Pitino’s teams are known for
being late bloomers, and if Louis-
ville can continue playing as well
as it has over the past'three weeks,
the Cardinals could make a lot of
noise in the conference and nation-
ally down the stretch.

6. Cincinnati — Victories over
DePaul and St. John’s were just
what the Bearcats (17-7, 7-4 Big
East) needed this week to recover
from a three—game losing streak.
C'incinnati’s inconsistencies stem
from the team’s tendency to live
and die by the 3-point shot, but
with a quality center like Yancy
Gates and tough tests still on the
schedule against Marquette and
Louisville, the Bearcats will have
several opportunities to prove to
everyone that they aren’t a one-
dimensional team.

- 7. South Florida — It was hard

" not to be impressed with the Bulls’

(14-10, 7-4 Big East) dominating
defensive performance in Wednes-
day’s victory over Pitt. South
Florida entered the crucial con-
test as the Big East’s second-best
defensive team statistically, and it
certainly validated that statistic at
the Panthers’ expense. If the Bulls

DePaul will be

a new winning
streak for their

team.  

continue to play such suffocating
defense and protect their home
court, they will ﬁnd themselves in
the NCAA Tournament.

- 8. West Virginia —- An_ overtime
victory at Providence couldn’t help

- the Mountaineers (16-9, 6-6 Big

East) out of their current slump,
as proven by a disappointing home
loss to Notre Dame on Wednesday
night. WVU —— even with probable

~ Big East Player of the Year Kevin
Jones in the ‘lineup —_— has now lost
four of its last ﬁve games — and the
schedule won’t get easier any time
soon. If the Mountaineers lose to

, Louisville on Saturday, this could
be the last week they spend in the
top half of my standings.

The bottom half of the Big East
deﬁnitely isn’t up to par with the

typical depth the conference has’

shown over the past few .seasons.

_ Seton Hall (9) ended its six-game

losing skid with a win at Rutgers
Wednesday, while Pitt (10) suffered
a momentum-killing defeat in
South Florida. Defending national
champion Connecticut (11) needs
to get out of a slump just to make
the NCAA‘ Tournament this year.
Finally, it looks like the Big East
Tournament will be where Rutgers

(12), Villanova (13), St.John’s (14), -

DePaul (15) and Providence (16)
will have their last chances to mak
the Big Dance. I '

Freshmen guards Haralds Kar-

Though Pitt has struggled on
the road this year, winning just
one of six matchups away from the
Petersen Events Center, the good
news for the Panthers is that they
are 5-1 against the Pirates in their
previous six meetings. Pitt cruised
to an easy 74-53 win over Seton
Hall at_home last season, but fell to
the Pirates 64-61 the last time the
teams met in Newjersey in 2010.
One thing is for certaini this Pitt

team is not like Pitt teams of the .

past. The way the Panthers have
played at times this year is a far

. cry from thejamie Dixon-coached

squad that took the ﬂoor just last :

SEHSOII.

Gilbert Brown, who started at ' «

small forward_for last year’s club
that won the Big East regular sea-
son championship, isn’t quite sure
what the difference is between that
team and the current team that is

‘struggling to keep its head above

water in the conference.
“I'think'it’s just the simple-fact
that, the way we competed, there
were never games when we lost by
20'or more. We were always bet-

' ter than that,” Brown said. “There

were guys that were on that team

' with us that are on this current

team that just haven’t shown [that
mentality] .”

While the 2011-12 Panthers have
only lost one game this season by
more than 20 points, if their wildly
inconsistent play continues, they
risk falling to 4-9'in Big East play
when they take on,Seton Hall this
weekend. '

At this point, with an overall
record of 15-10 and the nationwide
race for a spot in the NCAA Tour-
nament heating up, it wouldn’t be
a stretch to call Sunday’s game a

. “must-win” for the Panthers. I

' Most NBA teams faced questions of age or

unprepalredness as the lockout came to an

_ endthis season.

But the Oklahoma City Thunder avoided
all of those questions. Despite no organized
practice during the lockout, the Thunder’s
players knew theyonly needed to do one
thirlg in the upcoming season: win.

It’s rare —~ and dangerous for opponents
—— when a team can focus solely on win-°
ning due. to a lack of off—the-court issues. If

Most importantly,>Presti locked West-

the league in scoring the past two seasons,
and is currently averaging 27.3 points per
game through the Thunder’s 25 games.

Prior to the 2010-11 NBA season, Durant
accepted an extension to his contract for ﬁve
years and roughly $86 million.

That year, Presti also acquired George— .

town forwardjeff Green in a draft— day trade
with the Boston Celtics. Last season, Presti
traded Green to the Boston Celtics for their
starting center Kendrick Perkins, ﬁlling a

' hole at the center position.

In the 2008 draft, Seattle drafted UCLA
point guard Russell Westbrook with the
fourth overall pick. In his rookie season,
Westbrook made an immediate impact, scor-
ing 15.3 points per game and handing. out
5.3 assists per game. Westbrook played in

Harden rarely starts. During his rookie sea-
son, Harden played in 76 games and started
none of them. Last season, he played in every

single game but started only ﬁve. So far, in 0
the 2011-12 campaign, Harden played in all '

25 of the Thunder’s games to date, but only
started two. _ .

Head coach Scott Brooks starts the game
with a defensive player at the shooting guard
position, Thabo Sefolosha. With -all of the

I ‘scoring on the floor already in the forms of

Durant and Westbrook, Brooks can afford to
keep Harden on the bench forawhile and let
Sefolosha prevent the opponent’s best scorer
from starting the game hot.

Although Harden is undoubtedly the
better player, Sefolosha’s presence allows
Harden to go to work later when most of the

‘ players on the floor are bench players.

With this core in place, Oklahoma City
is currentlyon the right path with a 20-5
record —- the best record in the entire
‘league — and just needs to keep focusing
on winning. I
