Alabama NAACP leader arrested

By Jay Reeves

Associated Press Writer

MONTGOMERY, Ala. —— Law
officers arrested Alabama NAACP
president Thomas Reed and 10
other black leaders on Tuesday,
when they tried to climb a fence
around the Capitol to take down
the Confederate battle flag flying
over the dome. ~

Reed, a state representative
from Tuskegee, led a group of
several dozen blacks to a drive-
way gate where Reed talked to
state troopers for almost 20
minutes before attempting to
climb the 8—foot high fence.

‘I consider myself not violating
the law of this state,” Reed said.

After officersfgrabbed Reed by
the collar and pulled him down

from the fence, other members of
his group, among them NAACP
board member Emmett Burns, at-
tempted to climb over but were
also restrained.

”We are under arrest,” state
Rep. John Rogers of Birmingham
said as he entered the bus. The
charges were not immediately
known.

Earlier, as crowds had gathered
for the march sponsored by the
National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People, lo-
cal and state law enforcement
officers set up barricades and
confiscated an ax handle.

Reed contends the flag
represents racism and oppression
and said that if it was not taken
down voluntarily he planned to
”enter the Capitol grounds and

climb to the top of the state
Capitol dome and remove the
Confederate battle flag.”

He said the banner is resented
by blacks and ”better—thinking
white people.”

The NAACP is also campaign-
ing to bring down Confederate
battle flags at statehouses in
Alabama and South Carolina, as
well as to remove Confederate
flags from the designs of the Ge-
orgia and Mississippi state flags.

State officers said they confis-
cated an ax handle from three
youths in a pickup truck during
a search, but made no arrests.

Capitol security police were
under orders from Gov. Guy
Hunt not_ to allow anyone to
reach the Capitol, which is under-
going renovation and is surround-
ed by a locked, chain-link fence.

Battle of the brains takes place

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

Eight teams of four each com-
peted to earn the right to
represent Pitt at the College Bowl
Regionals last night at the -1988
University of Pittsburgh College
Bowl.

The Bowl is a game based on
academically—oriented questions
on almost any subject. There are
two halves of seven minutes each
in which an announcer first reads

a ten—point question, and either

team can answer. The team
which answers correctly gets a
shot at a twenty, twenty-five, or
thirty point bonus question. The
teams have five seconds to an-
swer the questions.

”This is a version of the origi-
nal game that was on television

many years ago,” said Joe Caval-
la, Pitt's Director of Student Ac-
tivities and announcer at Pitt's
College Bowl. ’’It was called the
General Electric College Bowl.
Then it went off the air, but was
still played on the college cam-
puses since somewhere in the
seventies.”

The winners were the three-
person team of Michael Young,
Larry Bernstein, and Robert
Thompson, who nicknamed
themselves ”Los Tres Amigos”.
They advance to West Virginia
University to play in the regional
tournament. There are fifteen
regions nationwide; Pitt belongs
to region four, which consists of
the entire state of Pennsylvania
west of Philadelphia, West Vir-
ginia, Maryland, and Washington
D.C. - — - A

The winner of the regional
event will then advance to the na-
tional tournament, to be televised
by the Disney Channel.

Young said he hadn't really
prepared for last night's event.
But he said, ”lf you want to be
good at [the College Bowl] as far
as the regional tournment, you
sure better practice or you're gon-
na get blown away. There are
teams who take the game very
seriously. They try hundreds of
practice questions and spend
hours reading almanacs.”

”There is a certain type of stu-
dent who likes this type of
game,” said Cavalla, “It is an aca-
demic quiz bowl and those kind
of people enjoy playing it.”

The event was held in the Wil-
liam -Pitt Union assembly room.

lenifer Lewis speaks

on black performers

By Marc Hopkins
Staff Writer

Jenifer Lewis walked on stage
promptly at 8:30 p.m. Monday
night in the assembly room of the
William Pitt Union and opened
with a blues—type melody.

Lewis was performing in a one-
woman show, "From Billie To
Lena With Jenifer,” sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council.

Lewis performed songs by a
number of significant black fe-
male vocalists, covering a large
time frame of music history.
Some of the singers honored in-
cluded: Billie Holiday who, said
Lewis, ”did not always sing the
blues, but when she sang it, sang
it better than anyone else after
her.” She also performed selec-
tions by Ethel Waters, Mahalia

Jackson, whom Miss Lewis callet.
”my Queen” and Lena.Horne,
who ”broke ground in films and
did not play traditional roles,
maids or prostitutes.”

Lewis honored these women
because they played significant
roles in the arts. They are are spe-
cial in her own life and opened
the door for her to sing.

Speaking about the show’s de-
velopment, Lewis said, ’’I did not

want the show to be predictable;

I didn't pick the songs that made
them famous, but songs meaning-
ful to the performers.”

Giving her perspective on con-
temporary performers, Lewis
said, ’’I’m not in love with Whit-
ney Houston; she has no perso-
nality. I'm not putting her down.

Dr. Thomas Starzl, professor
of surgery, announced the
awarding of a grant of over $4
million from the National In-
stitute of Health at a press con-
ference yesterday.

"Absolutely delighted," was
Starzl’s comment on his feel-
ings toward the five-year grant,
which will fund research on
development of better im-
munosuppressive transplant
drugs, develop pharmacolog-
ical techniques to prevent
acute rejection of transplant
organs and improve methods
of organ preservation.

Starzl receives grant
to research drugs

According to Starzl, ”Taken
as a whole, the work is
designed to increase the safe-
ty, cost efficiency and applica-
bility of all kinds of transplant
patient procedures, thereby
improving patient care.”

During the previous funding
period, Starzl brought liver
transplantation from ex-
perimenial stages to an accept-
ed therapy for end—stage liver
disease. During the last five
years of funding, Starzl and his
research team have produced
over 300 »medical publica-
tions, and transplant surgeons
from around the world con-
tinue to study under him.

Major networks refuse to carry Reagan speech

WASHINGTON — Congres-
sional Democrats are voicing
confidence that they will defeat
President Reagan's request for
$36.2 million in new aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
despite last-minute personal lob-
bying by the president and to-
day's plea for support by
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.

”Continued progress toward
democracy in Nicaragua and
peace in Central America de-
pends critically on U.S. support
for the Nicaraguan resistance,”
Shultz told the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee.

He said if Congress turns the
administration down, ”We can
be certain that no meaningful
progress in the direction of
moderation and democracy will
occur.”

Reagan was meeting with
about 20 House members today
and making a televised sales
pitch tonight to press his case. Ca-
ble News Network said it would
carry the 8 p.m. EST speech; PBS
said the address would be offered
to its affiliates; NBC, CBS and

ABC all said they would not tele-
vise it.

As Reagan kept up his lobby-
ing drive, Fitzwater said adminis-
tration officials continued to seek
”some new formula” to address
congressional concerns about
releasing the military portion of
the aid package.

But House Majority Leader
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., predict-
ed Reagan's job would be a
tough one.

60 held hostage as
gunmen storm school

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Two
gunmen wearing ski masks took
over a private school building
Tuesday and held a teacher and
about 60 children hostage while
one of the men detailed a series
of complaints against the govern-
ment, authorities said.

The takeover at the West End
Christian School began about
8:40 a.m., and the gunmen
demanded a meeting with Mayor
Al DuPont, police spokesman
David Hartin said. DuPont

donned a bullet-proof vest and
met with them twice.

DuPont told other city officials
that one of the men was a Viet-
nam War veteran who has ”a
generalized concern with the
government. He felt he had not
been treated fairly [and that] the
government is corrupt,” accord-
ing to Alan Goodwin, director of
the nearby Indian Rivers Mental
Health Center.

Hartin said a relative of one of
the captors also entered the build-
ing, but the gunmen’s identities
weren't divulged.

Police Chieflerry Fuller and As-
sistant Chief Ken Swindel were
seen outside a door attempting to
talk the two gunmen into surren-
dering. The lawmen could be
seen opening and closing the
door as they talked, witnesses
said.

The gunmen also requested tel-
evision coverage. Reporter Dan

The actress ”always looked like

memorize a 60-page script in

’’I’m not clear on the cause of
death. I was told it was related to

they thought she had the flu."

Miss O'Rourke died as she was
being taken to a hospital, but
Meyer said he was unsure what

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 3, I988

 

By James Rowley

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) -— Attor-
ney General Edwin Meese III tes-
tified Tuesday that he instructed
one of his aides in 1981 to inves-
tigate a complaint that Wedtech
Corp. wasn't getting fair treat-
ment in its bid for a , defense
contract.

Meese said that while he was
a presidential counselor in 1981,
he asked aide Ed Thomas to look
into the complaint made by E.
Bob Wallach, a San Francisco
lawyer who is a longtime friend
of the attorney general.

Meese, testifying at the illegal
lobbying trial of former White
House aide Lyn Nofziger, said
Wallach had told him that Wed-
tech was ”having difficulty ob-
taining a contract with the
Army.”

”The complaint I got was there
were people in the Pentagon who
were thwarting their efforts to get
the contract,” Meese said. Wal-
lach had indicated that Pentagon
officials were trying to steer the
contract ”to another entity.”

”My concern was that they
receive fair treatment and that it

‘ include the ordinary considera-

tion that any agency seeking a
contract should get from the fed-
eral government,” Meese said.

Meese, testifying as the last
prosecution witness against Nof-
ziger, identified a July 13, 1981,
memo he wrote saying, ”Ken
Cribb will stay on top of it.” At
the time, Cribb was working for
another White House office but
joined Meese’s staff in 1982.

The memo bore a reference to
Wedtech and Wallach.
Meese said he put a notation

on the memo for his secretary to
remind him or the staff about the
Wedtech contract in 30 days.

Nofziger, former White House
political director, is accused,
among other things, of illegally
lobbying Meese by sending him
an April 8, 1982, memo saying,
”It would be a blunder" not to
give Wedtech the contract.

Meese said he could not spe-
cifically recall any conversations
he had with his staff after receiv-
ing Nofziger’s memo but testified
that he must have talked about
the issue with deputy presidential
counselor James E. Jenkins.

The attorney general noted that
an attachment to the memo indi-
cates that Cribb and Jenkins were
assigned to look into the matter
but said he couldn't recall giving
them specific instructions.

Meese takes the stand in Wedtech trial

Jenkins, who went to work for
Wedtech in 1985, convened a
May 19, 1982, meeting at which
Army and other government offi-
cials discussed ways of helping
Wedtech get the no-bid contract
for minority businesses.

Jenkins testified that he took the
project upon himself after receiv-
ing Meese’s permission to pro-
ceed. But Jenkins, who testified
that he became interested after
meeting with Wedtech represen-
tatives, said Meese did not tell
him to convene the meeting.

In December, independent
counsel James C. McKay said
there was ”insufficient evidence
as of this date” to show that
Meese ”knowingIy participated
in criminal activity” involving
Wedtech but termed the finding
”an interim and not a final de-
cision.”

Gaming
club
explores
different

worlds ,

By Karen Segina
For The Pitt News I

If you are interested in journey-
ing toward unearthly existence,
there are some people here at Pitt
who may prove to be helpful
mediums.

These guides into the unknown
would seem to fit into the cool,
dark, mysterious corridors of the

Cathedral of Learning, but in fact,

they frequent the William Pitt Un-
ion. The Gaming Club, as it is
known, will lead you into this
secretive atmosphere of Dun-
geons and Dragons-

Sean Palmer, Colleen Collura,
Michael Schnell and Bill Brooks
are just a few of the club’s 40
members. Each of them invites
you to open your imagination
and perhaps enter into a role of
the game Dungeons and Dra-
gons. The adventures on which
the Gaming Club embarks and
the roles they assume in the game
provide a form of recreation away
from the logic of computer
science and the intricasies of
genetics. A

It's the same as escaping into
the pages of a book only this
time, ”you are able to assume the
role of your favorite character in
the book,” Gaming Club mem-
ber Colleen Collura stated.

”The interactions that take
place between characters and the
relationships that develop while
on the adventure sometimes in-
spire people to write books of
their own,” member Sean Palmer
said. Role games are not mere
games, they are individual adven-
tures, filled with experiences for
those who participate.

Playing Dungeons and Dra-

gons is not the only form of sport I
on the Gaming Club's agenda. ‘7

They also enjoy tactic games.
Risk, war games and Civilization
are three of the many strategy
conflicts into which they enter.
Practice is an important part of
developing the high skill level
that is necessary for a strong per-
formance in the game. Practice
also leads to winning, and win-
ning leads to gaming conven-
tions, like Gencon, where
”gaming professionals” meet and
match strategies.

The Gaming Club meets every
Thursday at 7 p.m., Friday at 3
p.m., Saturday and Sunday at
noon in the Student Union.

According to Dr. Marianne
Bouvier, national vice—president
of the GANC, 17 million
civilians, most of whom were
women and children, were
forced out of this territory by the
Soviets or by Soviet satellites.
Bouvier went on to state that
about 3 million died while at-
tempting to escape. Some of
those expelled were killed by

Soviet forces.

”This is the only time in histo-
ry that an army had specific ord-
ers to kill civilians,” Bouvier said.
She stated that one of the photos
in the exhibit is a reproduction of
the orders (in Russian) for the
army to kill civilians.

Bouvier went on to say that
many deaths were also a result of
exposure and starvation during
the long march to the west.

”Some walked 1000 kilometers
to reach the American zone  the
West was Paradise for them,” she
stated.

’’In the Claws of the Red Dra-
gon” has been displayed across
the nation, most recently in the
Rotunda of the Capitol.

”The purpose [of the exhibit] is
to acquaint the public with that
particular episode of history,”
Bouvier said.

Husbanddisillusioned after wife had an affair

Q: I learned some time ago

that many years earlier, my wife.-,

had‘be_en‘.‘unfaithfrJl to me. This

. would have astonished and hurt

me in any case, but the man hap-
pens to be someone I dislike. I
disliked this man long before I
ever dreamed my wife would
think of going to bed with him.
I likehim less now, of course,
having learned that she did.
The problem is that I want to
keep the present happy and
peaceful tenor ofour marriage. I
love my wife. I forgive her. Or,
rather, I understand how such
things happen, but everything is
spoiled because when I look at

her or think of sex with her,‘ these
visions of her having all-kinds of

.sex with this nerd rise upbefore

me. How to overcome this?

A: You can go to a therapist.
That is a good idea, for a few ses-
sions, but I realize that most peo-
ple don't go to a therapist like to
a hairdresser or a dry cleaner. So
there are home remedies. The
troublesome thing is those ”vi—
sions,” or negative fantasies.

The knowledge that your wife
and that man were together that
way years ago will not disappear,
but those noxious images can be
swept out. When they show up,
right away tell them ”Get out!”

  .DR. RUTH
 

and turn to something more help-
ful, like cleaning off your desk.

And this is useful —- think of
happy images of your wife. The
way she would look when you
first went out together and she
would meet you, coming toward
you smiling, or some more inti-
mate moment that is especially

pleasing. Think of that instead of _

those other images because you
can think of any picture you want
to. Another thing: It bugs you that

My hairspray may not please all the
people all the time,however we have a
tremendous amount of people using Puccini
Hairspray with great success. We find it to
be the best product to hold your hair in place,
it also won't pull your style out if you brush
or spray a second or third time.

I am so sure you will be pleased with
‘my’ products that I offer them with an
unconditional guarantee.

think. you are saying to -him,
”Who has this woman —- you or

Q: I have my fiance's ring, and
we plan to get married, but I am
worried that he is losing interest
in me, and the wedding wont

and his performance has been off

ally even if he loses his erection

or fails to ejaculate. But‘! can't I in

help worrying. V

A: I would worry, and I would
go to a marital counselor or ther-
apist. I would find out if I really
want to marry a guy who has lost
so much interest in me. And I
would do that now, not after the
wedding, because now you can
change your mind about hi
without having to consider all the
hardships of divorce.

Helms opposes missile treaty; claims it is unfair

By Lawrence Knutson
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —- The whales
were ”crimson,” the document
was ”hot” and an argument was
never far away on the central is-
sue of nuclear arms control in the
Senate hearing room.

When the the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee last week
opened its examination of the
new U.S.—Soviet treaty eliminat-
ing medium-range missiles in Eu-
rope, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
mounted a no—holds barred attack
against it.

As the hearings continued, se-

nators supporting the treaty hasti-
ly formed a Helms’ resistance
brigade to respond to his com-
plaints that the pact was unequal,
grossly unfair and would inevita-
bly lead to Soviet cheating.

But if the conservative North
Carolinian made no visible head-
way in his drive to prevent Senate
ratification of the pact, he was
able to force witnesses to talk
about his concerns.

There were treaty supporters,
including Secretary of State
GeorgeP. Shultz, who hoped that
Helms might somehow be
defused.

’’I don't accept that he is op-

posed to this treaty,” Shultz said.
’’I hope to convince him.”

”Good luck, Mr. Secretary,”
said Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-
Del., a treaty supporter. ”l hope
you're not so naive with the
Soviets.”

The treaty, Helms said, des-
troys only missiles, not their
nuclear warheads.

”A missile is the carrying case

‘and the warhead is the thing that

goes ’boom’ and kills you,”
Helms said. ”A missile doesn't
kill you unless it falls on your
head and cracks it open.”

The nuclear material in the
warhead cannot hurt anyone un-

less it can be attached to a mis-
sile, fired from a launcher and
can hit a target, said Reagan ad-
ministration witnesses.

The treaty bans all of that.

The pact, Helms said, gives the
Soviets great advantage because
it permits them — as well as the
United States — to salvage and
store the nuclear material from
the missile warheads.

”Sen. Helms has now created
a stockpile gap,” said Biden.
”He’s arguing that if these
weapons are completely des-
troyed, the Soviets will still have
an advantage.

’’It seems to me this is a red
herring,” Biden said.

’’It’s more than a red herring;
I would call it a crimson whale,”
said Washington's Sen. Daniel
Evans, one of Helms’ GOP col-
leagues.

Later, Evans addressed the

Helms objection that the Soviets
have an advantage because the
nuclear warhead material they
are permitted to retain would be
far greater than the nuclear
material retained by the Ameri-
can side.

This is so, defenders of the
treaty said, because there are
more Soviet than American
medium—range missiles, and the
Soviets would have to destroy
more missiles to reach the treaty’s
goal of zero missiles.

”|nstead of a crimson whale we
have a whole pod of crimson
whales,” Evans said.

Helms produced a classified
document marked "TOP
SECRET.”

He said it contained informa-
tion, which he could not discuss
in public, that shows the Soviets
are cheating on the treaty even
before it is ratified.

- The painful e

Ashland Oil, the company
whose shoddy storage tank con-
struction and irresponsible
management resulted in the pol-
lution of the Monongahela and

T Ohio rivers with a million gallons

of petroleum, got a real bargain
when they purchased the good
name of Pitt for a mere pocketful
of change. Instead of spending
millions of dollars on a public re-
lations campaign to resuscitate
the company's oil—stained image,
they’ have elected instead to
whitewash their negligence by
throwing a few hundred thou-
sand dollars at the University of
Pittsburgh for a much-publicized
study of the environment.

It is tragic when a person is in
acircumstance which compels
them to sell their body to another
who seeks to exploit it. But, if
they must, they should at least get
a good price. I wonder if Presi-

- dent Posvar considered this prin-

ciple when he engaged Ashland
in this oleaginous embrace.

Burst bubbles

This letter is in response to
Paulette Butler's ”foolish” attack
on William Young. For those
readers wholmay have missed
Mr. Young's (column), ”English
only —- a good idea,” h supports
the legislation that wo" d make
the language of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, and he
also feels that it would not be dis-
criminatory to minorities.

Ms. Butler says Mr. Young is ”a
fool” for supporting this bill and

that it is discriminating against

minorities. However, it could
only be to a foreigner’s benefit to
learn English.

You suggested that ”we” drop
Mr. Young off in a small town in
Europe where no one speaks En-
glish. And I agree that it would
take him quite a long time to
return to the States, but, if Mr.
Young had learned the language,
he could have spent all his time
enjoying the culture that the
country had to offer rather than
wandering aimlessly around the
countryside. Furthermore, a sym-
pathetic attitude is not going to
provide directions downto_wn
and God forbid one (a foreigner)
should need directions to a
hospital.

I certainly did not expect you
to give these ideas any thought
considering your qualifications in
making your judgement. You
said, ”No, I am not a foreign stu-
dent. No, I don't speak any lan-
guage but English. No, I have
never visited a foreign country.”
No, I am not a foreign student,
but I do speak another language
and I have been to a foreign
country. I know how beneficial it
is to know the official language
of the country in which one
resides.

To close, I suggest that you
burst your superficial bubble of
dream houses and Porsche 9445
and stop being so narrow mind-
ed. And maybe all of us at Pitt
should keep a watchful eye on
Paulette Butler and her superfi-
cial, sympathetic friends. She gets
my vote for martyr of the year.

LETTERS  
mbrace of Ashland Oil

The burning Bush

I disagree with Frances Sansig
concerning her opinion in
”Rather refuses to beat around
Bush” (Jan 28).

Ms. Sansig seems to have
jumped on the bandwagon to
conform with the majority of the
media who feel Rather is shaping
media in a way that is ”discon—
certing,” as Ms. Sansig sees it.

I viewed the entire nine
minutes of the Rather-Bush inter-
view and found only one insta-
ncewhere Rather could be
described as ”disconcerting”: his
abrupt, maybe ignorant, ending
of the interview.

In contrast I found George
Bush's performance ”disconcert—
ing” through the entire interview.
Bush was ignorant, abrasive,
quick-tempered and even child-
like in his ”sticks and stones” at-
titude, about a serious question:
Did Bush know about the arms
for hostages deal with the
Iranians?

This is a very important ques-
tion whose true answer would
shed more light on the scandal
and would attest to Bush's
character — the very thing the
media has used to justify the
reporting of Hart's infidelity. I
find it a contradiction on the part
of the media to press for charac-
ter analysis based on the fidelity
of one presidential candidate and
then beat on Dan Rather for pur-
suing a similar character analysis
of George Bush based on his
honesty with the public concern-
ing foreign policy knowledge.

There is strong evidence for
and against Bush's integrity from
the Iran—Contra hearings, and
Dan Rather mentioned the evi-
dence against Bush and asked
him to answer. Bush dodged the

questions, and Rather asked
again. Bush cried: unfair. ”You
told my people that you [Rather]
were going to do a profile of the
candidates and this would be a
profile of me.”

Well Mr. Vice President, when
does a profile define boundaries
which determine the relevancy of
a question? Even if those bound-
arries do exist, the Hart fiasco has
broadened them more than
enough to include lying to the
public as fair game.

Whether Bush is lying, and I

thus has no integrity, or not lying,
he has made a fool of himself by
becoming irate over a very
honest, important and popularly
supported question by Dan
Rather. Mr. Rather had every right
and even a duty to pursue the
question and its answer.

And Ms. Sansig and others of
her opinion will scold Rather and
vote for a man who acts like an
imbecile on national television
because someone wants him to
account for his position in the
face of contradicting evidence.

George Bush: knee deep in testosterone

When we last tuned in to ”The
Story of George Bush: Macho or
Mouse?” the year was 1984, the
city was Philadelphia, and the
event was the vice presidential
debate. There, an effervescent
candidate attested to the utter joy
he felt at being Reagan's Veep,
joy that ran from his toes to his
tenor.

The morning after the debate
with the diminutive Geraldine
Ferraro, he told a longshoreman
gleefully: ”We tried to kick a lit-
tle ass last night.”

Now it is 1988, and the most
recent scene in ”Macho or
Mouse” pitted George Bush

g against Dan Rather in a debate

that acheived the intellectual lev-
el of a playground pushing

Freedom

A student newspaper such as
The Pitt News, The Tartan, The
Student Union or The Allegheny
View has relevance beyond its
daily circulation. These papers
are documents of student
courage, at once timely and
historical. These papers also train
students to experience and en-
dure the effect of confrontation,
ego-inflation and apathy. As
barometers of the times, the
broadness of sympathy, or the
narrowness of vision that these
papers demonstrate attest to the
character of those young persons
to whom the future is held in
bond. Whether these students
enter the Federal Reserve System,
private business, kindergarten
teaching, rock music, or the gul-
leys of the unheeded and un-
loved, indeed even if a student
should find his or herself sleep-
ing over a steam duct on the

the Bush camp was overjoyed at

the verbal wrestling match with
Rather as a shot in the arm for the
campaign. The needle was full of
testosterone.

Apparently, the George Bush
Manhood Test for 1988 is taking
the offensive against a television
anchor. An aide called the inci-

Writing for a student paper rne—
ans reaching somebody, it means
challenging the laws of libel, ob-
scenity and conventional wis-
dom. It means taking off the
tonguechains which bind the
mind to silence and standing for
the revolutions of the 18th cen-
tury which defined the rights of
press for all time as sacred.
Every moment that students are
silent about their views and the
issues that concern them is an in-
scription on the legacy of what

Combat pay? From where I sat,
it was much less like a war and
more like a fraternity house
thumb-wrestling match: unseem-
ly, and just a bit absurd. Yet it sat-
ed some particular desire to see
the guys mix it up.

I don't know when the Ameri-
can public turned permanently
into the American audience. The

I citizen is now the couch potato

and politics has become a spec-
tator event. This transition has
elevated television journalists to
the level of contestants, and low-
ered the whole level of discourse.
It's more fun to watch the blood
dripping on the floor.

Consider what's happening to
the news talk shows. Dan Rather,
ifl may paraphrase B_ush, is a kit-
ten compared to the clawed cast
of Crossfire. Political opinions on
The McLaughlin Group are ex-
pressed with the grace of a good
fight. At least one news show, un-
der the aegis of Morton Downey,
Jr., has transformed the talk show
into a rabble—rouse. On the other
hand, Bush was the only candi-
date who refused an hour of civi-
lized persistence by Marvin Kalb
on public television.

Is there a national hankering af-
ter a good fight? ”For the Repub-
lican right,” said ABC's Jeff
Greenfield, ”being attacked by

Dan Rather is like being attacked
by Gadhafi.” In real life his wres-
tle with Rather may be a lot more
like an attack of Gadhafi. It felt
great at the time, everybody

stood up and cheered, but turned I

out to be the wrong target.

I find this long—running play -—
Macho or Mouse — more than a
little repellent. It grow out of an
attitude that confuses the Halls of
Montezuma with the Shores of
Grenada. It's the attitude that asks
whether a candidate can stand up
to Gorbachev instead of asking
whether he can sit down with
him.

I remember another time last
year when Bush spoke of his frus-
tration with the wimp question.
Didn't it take strength to sit and
watch your child die? He had
done that. But now he gains
points as a kick—ass candidate.
The man who stood up to Dan
Rather.

This may be the year when
candidates all have to pass a
testosterone test when they have
to win a gold medal in anchor
wrestling. But if I were writing the
scorecard for this pugnacious po-
litical event, it would be Bush-O,
Rather—O, Leadership-0.

Pa. lawmakers take steps against corporate raids

HARRISBURG — A House
committee on Tuesday approved
legislation designed to dis-
courage hostile takeovers of pub-
lic corporations in Pennsylvania.

The bill, supported by the

A Casey administration, won unani-
mous approval from the Business
and Commerce Committee,
which sent the legislation to the
House floor. A similar bill is
pending in the Senate.

House Majority Whip Robert
O'Donnell, a Philadelphia
Democrat who proposed the
legislation, said the General As-
sembly should act quickly on the
bill, especially since last Oc-
tober's problems with the stock
market caused many companies
to become undervalued.

noted.

The legislation would lower
from 30 percent to 20 percent the
threshold at which a stockholder
is considered to have acquired
control of a company. That
threshold would be used to trig-
ger additional safeguards for
other stockholders.

O'Donnell said the legislation
would clarify that it is legal for
companies and stockholders to
use so—called "poison pill" agree-
ments to make takeovers less at-
tractive.

The provision would allow
agreements permitting stock-
holders to purchase additional
shares of stock at a prearranged
price if a company is taken over.

That would dilute the position of

BRIDGEWATER, Pa. «— The FBI
is analyzing fingerprints removed
from a railroad switch in an inves-

Authorities are looking for two
teen-age boys suspected of

The accident occurred on
tracks owned by Pittsburgh &
Lake Erie Railroad. The main
track was reopened Monday, but
the other track where the derail-
ment occurred may be out of
operation for one or two weeks,
said P&LE spokesman Charles
Craig. _

Craig said the railroad and CS/C
will share cleanup expenses, ex-
pected to cost more than
$500,000. The railroad likely will
try to recover costs from any party
responsible for causing the derail-
ment, he said.

Somerset man dies in
plane crash at airport

SOMERSET, Pa. — The pilot of
a twin-engine plane was killed
Tuesday when he tried to land at
the Somerset County Airport ant}
crashed in a field near the run-
way, authorities said.

Airport Manager Robert Aultz
said the pilot, John Higgins of
Somerset, was dead at the scene.
He was believed to be in his 20s.

Higgins took off alone from the
airport shortly after noon in his
father's Cessna, according to
Aultz. After five minutes in the
air, Higgins tried to return be-
cause of bad weather.

The plane crashed 500 feet to
the right of the runway, Aultz
said. Emergency crews had to ex-
tricate his body from the plane.

Aultz says Higgins had just
wanted to fly around the area.

PITTSBURGH — Allegheny
County officials said they will ask A
a federal judge this week to ord-

sentenced to state prisons from
the county jail to alleviate over-
crowding.

Assistant Solicitor George Di-
amantopulos said the county will
seek a preliminary injunction Fri-
day during a hearing before U.S.
District Judge Maurice Cohill. If
granted, the injunction will re-
quire the state to remove 84
prisoners from the jail.

Commonwealth Court ruled
two weeks ago against taking
such action.

Friday's hearing will determinu
whether Cohill has set a cap of
435 inmates at the new jail an-
nex, where 502 people were be-
ing held Monday.

Lady  ers down Colonials i n

  

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

Deidra Baker hit a baseline
jumper with :27 seconds remain-
ing in overtime and stole an er-
rant pass with one second left to
preserve an 83-82 non-
conference Pitt victory over
Robert Morris at Sewell Center
last night.

Baker, a 5-9 junior forward,
scored the last four Pitt points and
had 10 of her 16 points in the se-

Redmen, Panthers battle

cond half.

The Lady Panthers trailed the
Lady Colonials 74-71 with :20 se-
conds remaining when sopho-
more forward Lorri Johnson hit a
three-point field goal to tie the
game.

Robert Morris then worked the
ball down under their basket, but
the Lady Colonials’ Patti Simcic
fouled Lady Panther guard Jen-
nifer Shingler with one second re-
maining.

Shingler went to the line for a

one—and—one which would have
won the game for Pitt, but missed
the front end, forcing the over-
time period.

Shingler had hit six consecutive
free throws before missing in the
final second of regulation.

od with a three—point shot by
junior point guard Denise
Becher, but Simcic countered
with two consecutive baskets for
Robert Morris.

for first place tonight

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Freshman basketball players are the
ones expected to have the most trouble
playing on the road. That's not the case
at Pitt.

Paul Evans, the Pitt coach, won't mind
using the foursome of Jason Matthews,
Sean Miller, Darelle Porter and Bobby
Martin in tonight's game against St. John's
in New York (9 p.m. start, ESPN).

It's the Panther veterans that concern
Evans. 1

Pitt has never won at two arenas in the
Big East — Georgetown's Capital Centre
and St. John's Alumni Hall.

”You look at the Georgetown game [a
62-57 Pitt loss Jan. 6], the freshmen wer-
en't the ones that hurt us," Evans said.

Tonight, Pitt seniors Charles Smith and
Demetreus Gore get their final chance to
avert a shutout. Pitt is 0-5 in Alumni Hall
and the last two losses have been the
most disappointing — 78-75 in overtime
and a 76-74 loss in the regular season
finale last year. The loss prevented the
Panthers from winning the conference ti-
tle outright.

Will Smith and Gore feel added pres-
sure because they've never won at Alum-
ni Hall? ”It might be in their minds, but
our freshmen don't give a bleep because
they don't know [about Pitt's winless
streak at St. John's] and they weren't a part
of it," Evans said.

”The freshmen go down to West Vir-
ginia and they play [well] because they're
not concerned with that stuff. That may
be something that's helped this team a lit-
tle bit. There's not enough of the veterans
left anymore to have these mental [hang-
ups],” he added.

With a win tonight, Pitt would retain
possession of first place in the league. A
loss would drop Pitt into second place,
a half-game behind the Redmen.

”St. John's is in real good shape. That's
why this is a very important game for us,”

Evans said.

Pitt [ranked ninth by The Associated
Press] is 15-2 overall and 5-1 in the Big
East- St. John's [ranked 20th by AP] is 14-3
and 5-2.

Both teams have won five straight con-
ference games.

Pitt is the first of four consecutive home
games for St. John's. The Panthers play
five of their next seven games on the road.

Pitt defeated the Redmen on Jan. 9 at
Fitzgerald Field House, 81-70.

But this isn't the same St. John's team
Pitt played a month ago. The Redmen
have won three road games in the last two
weeks against Georgetown, Villanova
and Seton Hall. A

”St. John's is playing very well. The
junior college guards [Greg Harvey and
Michael Porter] took a little time to ad-
just. They're playing well now. [Sopho-
more center] Jayson Williams gives them

a little more offense. They're sitting in a -
pretty good position right now," Evans V

said.

St. John's was picked fifth in the league
coaches’ pre—season poll.

Evans has a few theories as to why
everyone overlooks St. John's every year,
only to watch the Redmen battle for the
league title.

”Maybe Louie [Carnesecca, St. John's
coach] downgrades his people some-
times. I think the New York papers down-
grade them sometimes."

According to Evans, St. John's always
surprises other teams because most of its
star players either transferred to the school
or came from a junior college.

Former St. John's star Walter Berry
came from San Jacinto Junior College,
and so did the Redmen’s starting back-
court of Harvey and Porter.

Big Three lead Redskins to championship

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Ricky Sanders, Timmy Smith
and Doug Williams —- who
would have thought ...?

Who, in all of the football
world, would have predicted that
these ”Three Redskinos" would
emerge as the Big Enchiladas in
Washington's 42-10 massacre of
the Denver Broncos in Super
Bowl XXII?

Probably not even Sanders,
Smith or Williams. ‘ '

Sanders, who scored two
touchdowns in the Redskins’ se-

cond Super Bowl victory, set the
game's recieving yardage record
with 193 yards on only nine
catches. He had eclipsed Steeler
Lynn Swann's record of 161, set
in Super Bowl X, by halftime with
1 77.

He also teamed up with Wil-
liams for an 80-yard touchdown
play, tying the record set in Su-
per Bowl XV by Jim Plunkett and
Kenny "King of the Oakland
Raiders.

Smith, only a rookie, set the Su-
per Bowl rushing record by
amassing 204 yards on only 22
carries. The previous record was

held by the LA Raiders Marcus
Allen, who rushed for 191 against
Washington in Super Bowl XVIII.
Smith also scored for the Red-
skins on touchdown runs of 58
and 4 yards.

Williams, named this year's
MVP for the game, simply had
the best passing performance in
Super Bowl history, completing
18 passes for 340 yards and four
touchdowns.’ His passing -yardage
eclipsed the previous record, set
by Joe Montana of the San Fran-

cisco 49ers in Super Bowl XIX, by _

only 9 yards.
Yet Montana threw the football

35 times that day. Williams threw
it only 29 this past Sunday.

The strange thing is, that had it
not been for various injuries and
a bit of ineptitude, Sanders, Smith
and Williams probably wouldn't
have even played in the Super
Bowl, let alone had any type of
significant impact. J

First, consider Sanders. A
5-foot—1 1, 180-lb. wide reciever
from Southwest Texas State,
Sanders came to the’Reds-kins as
a result of the collapse of the
United States Football League.
He originally signed out of col-
lege with the USFL’s Houston

Gamblers, and was a member of
that team's famous set of diminu-
tive but fleet wideouts known as
the Mouseketeers.

The tallest of the Mouseketeers,
Sanders was the favorite target of
then-Gambler quarterback Jim
Kelly, now with the Buffalo Bills.
The Gamblers employed the
wide-open Run-and-Shoot
offense, and was the highest scor-
ing team in the league.

But upon joining the Redskins,
Sanders role turned from Run-
and-Shoot to something like Sit-
and-Wait. Then, after playing

and activities. Applications are available in

Room 130 William Pitt Union and are due
by February 19, 1988.

James Madison and Radford took
third and fourth, scoring 222.0
and 202.9, respectively.

”We did much better than we
did at Michigan. We corrected a
lot of our mistakes,” said head
coach Frank D’Amico. ”Our
team is much stronger.”

The Panthers are now 4-0 for
the season.

”Going in, we were worried,

”The guys were up for this

9.0, and Pollaci finished fifth.

Pollaci was first on the rings,
scoring 9.05. Dan Tarosky was
third, scoring 8.65, and Gonza-
lez was fourth with 8.6.

The top Pitt vaulters were Gon-
zalez and Pollaci, who tied for
fourth with an 8.85.

The Panthers placed four gym-
nasts in the finals of the parallel
bars, with Pollaci and Gonzalez
finishing fourth and fifth with
scores of 8.7 and 8.35, respec-
tively.

On the high bar, Gonzalez
took first with a score of 9.3. Pol-
laci took third with a score of 8.4,
and Bullard took fifth with an 8.1.

”Senior Danny Tarosky just
came back from a broken hand
and made finals on the parallel
bars. I think this is a tribute to his
hard work. Freshman David Has-
selbrook made finals on the high
bar and parallel bars. This shows
he's been working really hard,”
added D’Amico.

Pitt snared the top two all-
around titles with sophomore
Gonzalez finishing first by scor-
ing 53.05 and sophomore Polla-
ci finishing second by scoring
52.95.

”This meet was a good pick-
me-up. We're improving the
quality of our routines and pick-
ing up our scores,” Pollaci
added. ’

”We all hit our routines better.
Our team goal was 255, and we
hit 250 without Brock. Our inten-
sity was up,” he added.

Sophomore Brock Freehling
did not compete because early
last week, he suffered an eye in-
jury, and he is expected to miss
several weeks.

Once again, the Panthers were
without the services of senior
Jorge Sanchez because of his
recurring back ailment.

’’I think we did a pretty good
job considering Brock was hurt,”
said Powanda. ”Everybody did
their jobs.”

”This is my worst year as a
coach for having injured gym-
nasts not being able to compete,”
said D’Amico. ”But it's reward-
ing to be getting the scores we
have been without some of our
regulars competing.”

Though not finishing in the top
five, strong performances came
from freshmen Chris O’Loughlin,
Todd Probeck and Hasselbrook.

The Panthers next meet will be
against Temple University on
Feb. 14 at Trees Hall.

only sparingly in 1986 and most

Monk was injured in early De-

the first round of the playoffs,
catching six passes for 92 yards
against the Chicago Bears.

Along with his 80-yard TD
reception, Sanders also teamed
up with Williams for a 50-yarder
in the ‘Skins 35-point second
quarter. 

Smith is even more of a sur-
prise, for no one really knew any-
thing about him, even when he

was in college at Texas Tech. .

Had he been a star at Tech, Smith
might not have even been around
for Washington to draft. Yet, an-
kle and knee injuries forced
Smith to miss all but one game in

his final two seasons with the Red
Raiders. He was anything but a
household name.

Still, Redskin General Manager
Bobby Beathard said he saw
enough of Smith during his
sophomore season to invest a
fifth-round draft selection in him.

The move paid off several
times over.

During the regular season,
while playing behind Kelvin
Bryant and George Rogers, Smith
rushed only 13 times for 72
yards. Then Rogers hurt his ankle
just before the playoffs, and Smith
responded with a total of 138
yards on 29 carries against the
Bears and the Minnesota Vikings,
setting the stage for his Super
Bowl heroics.

Williams traveled the toughest
road of the three on his way to
Super Bowl immortality.

Williams, too, had’ played in
the USFL. He left the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers for the fledgling
league's Oklahoma Outlaws. The
league folded, then Williams’
wife died eight days after doctors

discovered she had a brain
tumor. Williams’ was broken-
hearted, without a job, and even
worse, without any offers.

Then finally, in the fall of 1986,
Redskin coach Joe Gibbs, who
had been an assistant with Tam-
pa Bay while Williams was still
with the team, offered him the
backup position behind starter
Jay Schroeder.

Schroeder led Washington as
far as the _NFC Championship
game in 1986, but struggled con-
siderably at times throughout this
season, enough that Gibbs
replaced him twice -— the last
time for good —— with Williams.

Although the team finished

11-4 in 1987, Williams and the.

Redskins were nothing spectacu-
lar in the playoffs. But Williams
managed to lead his team to
21-17 and 17-10 wins, going 23
of 55 for 326 yards and one
touchdown in both games com-
bined. Then Williams turned it
loose against the Broncos.

Guess you could say all three
of them did.

inducted into Hall

By Earl Bohn

Associated Press Writer

PlTTSBURGH — Jack Ham be-
gan his football career with little
confidence and with just about as
much interest from college
scouts.

He went on to become the pro-
totype outside linebacker, a play-
er so skilled at defending both the
run and the pass that he ”rede-
fined the way the position was
played,” said former Cincinnati
Bengals tight end Bob Trumpy.

Ham, a native of Johnstown,
Pa., earned first-ballot election
Tuesday to the Pro Football Hall
of Fame, becoming the second
member of the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers’ ”Team of the ’70s” to gain
induction.

”lt’s a great feeling,” Ham said.

”He did everything right — on
and off the field,” said Steelers
president Dan Rooney.

”Jack’s selection is not a sur-
prise,” said Steelers coach Chuck
Noll. ”He was an impact player.
He was one of the real intelligent,
find-the-football type players
against the run, and he was ex-
ceptional against the pass in man-
to-man, zone, whatever defense
we were in.”

It wasn't until former Steelers
defensive tackle Joe Greene,
whom he called ”the cornerstone
of our team” was inducted last
year that Ham realized he had a
chance to be enshrined in Can-
ton, Ohio.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 3, I988

. Continued from page 13
other native western Pennsylva-
nians, former Pitt tight end Mike
Ditka of Aliquippa and Fred Bilet-
nikoff of Erie, and former Min-
nesota Vikings defensive tackle
Alan Page on July 30.

The 6-foot-1, 225-pound Ham
developed his natural athletic
abilities at Penn State and was

Pittsburgh's second-round pick in
the 1971 NFL draft. During his 12
Steelers’ seasons, he was elected
to the Pro Bowl eight consecutive
times from 1974 to 1981 and was
a star on the Steelers’ four Super
Bowl ‘title teams.

He retired in 1983 at age 34 to
work as a salesman for a coal
company.

’’I enjoyed playing college foot-
ball and never thought about pro
ball until my junior year in col-
lege and never thought of my pro
career lasting that long,'' Ham
said.

’’In high school [Bishop
McCort], I wasn't exactly a
sought—after recruit. Those were
probably my down years,” he

said. ”Not until I went to Penn
State did things turn around for
me.”

Penn State Coach Joe Paterno
gave Ham's career an important
boost.

’’I was a young kid who didn't
have a lot of confidence until I
went to Penn State. Paterno 
he's the kind of guy who put me

on first—team defense in my first
year. It kind of made me a little
more confident. I kind of ran with
it," he said.

Ham was noted for diagnosing
offenses and anticipating plays
and had the advantage of playing
behind the left side of a dominat-
ing defensive line anchored by
Greene and L.C. Greenwood.

Redmen

Continued from page 11
career with the Redmen. Starting
small forward‘Matt Brust trans-
ferred from North Carolina.

”People see these kids and
they think, ’How good can they
be? They came back to St.
John's,’ " Evans said. ”That's
Louie's forte —. he lets them all
come back and they all play well
for him."

The key for Pitt tonight, accord-

ing to Evans, will be hitting the
perimeter jumper. Pitt was able to
beat St. John's in January without
a strong perimeter game.

Pitt's big men did the majority
of the scoring as Smith, Gore and
Jerome Lane combined for 57
points, mostly on fast-break
baskets.

A running game would suit the
Panthers best, but Evans said a

team can't count on that. Pitt got
out to a quick 12-O start in the first
St. John's game. That was the
only reason the Panthers were
able to play at an up-tempo for 40
minutes.

”St. John's sags so badly in
their man—to—man that they're giv-
ing you 15- and 18-foot shots. If
you're not hitting, then you're not
getting second shots and you're
in for a rough night," Evans said.

Last year, St. John's was suc-
cessful in shutting down Smith.
Evans said that shouldn't happen
this time around because the
Redmen don't have enough play-
ers to bang up the 6-foot-10
Smith.

Said Evans: ”They don't have
three guys to rotate like la-. t year,

   

so they don't give 15 fouls. Se-
condly, our outside shooting is a
little better, so it's forcing people
to play our outside people.
”Last year Curtis [Aiken] didn't
have a good game either time
[against St. John's], whereas Jason
[Matthews] or Sean [Miller] could
both hurt you from outside."
