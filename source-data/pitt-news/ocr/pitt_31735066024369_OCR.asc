Warner Cable to
Open First Center

By GLENN FREUND

 Pitt News Staff Writer

Warner Cable of Pittsburgh will
open its first “Community Com-
munication Production Center” in
Oakland’s Webster Hall Hotel in
May. '

Promoters say it will be the start
of the communications phase of the
city's Renaissance ll. _

Community Communications is
part of an ambitious project by
Warner and the city to turn Pitts-
burgh into a video communications
paradise, linking people to people.

Beyond entertainment and better
reception, cable TV in Pittsburgh
promises to offer a widespread
medium for educators, community
groups, institutions and individuals,

?.‘!"I-'= according to organizers of the

 

project.

Under its 15-year contract with
the city, Warner has committed
itself to build five TV production
studios like the one in Oakland to
serve different sections of the city.

“They will be well-equipped, and
resident and community groups
with Comunity Communications
are offered free production of their
own shows,” said Evan Pattak, spo-
kesman for Warner.

“We think its innovative,” he
said. “We hope we’ll be uniquely
successful in linking neighborhoods

Brother Ricahard Emmenecker,
superintendent of the city’s Bureau
of Cable Communications, also
showed enthusiasm for Community
Communications.

“There is an opportunity for a
community soapbox,” he said.

Emmenecker added that work-
shops financed by Warner will “train

State funding for Pitt and other
state-related universities will not be
affected by Gov. Thornburgh’s
proposal to abolish the state liquor
store system, Thornburgh press spo-
kesman Kirk Wilson said.

Under Thornburgh’sq proposal,
State Store system
would be replaced by ‘privately
owned and operatedretail outlets
for the sale of liquor and wine.

“The state will con-timfe to operate
the wholesale liquor distribution

~system and control the wholesale

pricing-operations. By so doing, we
can continue to ensure adequate
revenues to the state...,” according
to Thornburgh’s proposal.

However, Liquor. Control Board
(LCB) Daniel Pennick criticized
Thornburgh’s proposal, and
claimed the LCB is a profitable
system.’ .

“The governor campaigned for
reform,” Pennick said. “But "he
hasn’t come over to us with any
reform legislation, he just wants to
abolish us. We’re reforming right

years.” _

State Senator Richard Tighlman
has written a proposal supporting
the idea to abolish the LCB.

“...the present LCB is in such a
state as to merit direct, immediate
and complete legislative action to.
drastically alter the present liquor

system,” Tig_hlman’s“ proposal ,
stated. '  v V 7

man said.‘“The people ’aren’t getting

Tighlman added he is basing his
statements on the results of a

Mary Lou Daniel is seeking
endorsement as a Democratic candi-
date for City Council. She is the
Director of the Neighborhoods for
Living Center in the City Housing
Department, which works with
neighborhood organizations, prom-
oting neighborhoods and providing
information. Daniel was formerly
Executive Director of the Pittsburgh
Neighborhood Alliance. I
PITT NEWS: What do you see as
the issues for this City Council race?
DANIEL: Community and neigh-
borhood issues are very important.
I’m not sure people understand how
this Republican administration will
affect this city and how it will proba-.
bly affect its neighborhoods. The
budget cuts will have a severe effect
on neighborhood improvement.
We've got to have the ability to
expand the city tax base.

Capital improvements that take
placedowntown are going to be paid
for probably with bond money by
the city. That may obligate us to a
debt ten years down the line. We’ve
got to make sure the money used to
pay that debt is there and isn’t going

‘to be at the expense of something

that needs to be done in the
neighborhoods.
PITT NEWS: Where doesthe

strength lie in the city that city
government should be exploiting?
DANIEL: City government has to
be willing to use neighborhood
organizations and non—profit groups
a little bit better. There’s a lot of
talent and volunteer time out there.
Typically, government hires people
and provides services.

There are community groups

working on crime prevention and
fire prevention techniques and emer-
gency medical services. We’ve got to
be able to help them be a little better
prepared so we don’t have to use
money to get people to do it.

In most cases Council has‘ been
reacting to proposals the Mayor
puts forth. They haven’t been initiat-
ing programs. We don't have anyone
working on ride sharing, for
example.

PITT NEWS: Do you think the
Oakland plan is likely to be
successful? »

DANIEL: The important thing is
that all sectors stay involved in the
Plan. Sometimes a planning process
takes place and then when it comes
to implementation the ‘* neighbor-
hood sector drops out or gets pushed
out and the other sectors take over.
As long as the neighborhood sector

stays involved"l think it’ll probably’

work.
PITT NEWS: What could be done
about the housing problem in
Oakland?
DANIEL: The housing problem has
to be addressed by the University by
working with neighborhood groups.
They have to share some of the
responsibility for bringing thou-
sands of people into the Oakland
area and dumping them on the
neighborhood. They might work out
with neighborhood and city easy
transportation to nearby neighbor-
hoods where there is housing.

The University is responsible for

P running roughshod over the com-

munity without caring what it was
doing and obviously not communi-
cating with anybody. I heard a union
man say any time you sign an agree-
ment with the University you can be

ito create an informal rap group con-
sisting of men that.were having
problems dealing with the daily

:social pressures of being male. They‘

each called up friends, and the Men’s
Collective was born. After bouncing
from house to house for their meet-
ings, they ended up at the Lutheran
Student Center‘ on Forbes Avenue,
where they meet every Thursday at
7:30 p.m. . i I .
“There are two types of pro-
grams,” Morgan said. “One is the
‘programmed’, which we’ve held for
the past four weeks. It was a series of
seminars on male power and the
problems that power causes for men

and women. We covered topics like g

rape, sexual harassment on the job,
pronography and the media, and

domestic violence. We organized-

these special programs. several times
a year. ,

“The ‘unprogrammed’ is strictly
an all-male raip group," said Mor-
gan. “l_t’s a sounding board: We
"come here to get feedback from
other males who are having similar
problems." _ ‘

port. Its the kind of support that
would normally come from a wife,
mother or girlfriend. Instead ofrely-

men. , 

Members of thegroup ‘said the
Collective has’ helped them
individuallly.

-“Pviersonnally,” Hollahan said,
“I've learned to control myself a lot
more, especially around my son. l

higher breaking point." A i

’ “l find many people wrapped up
in their :job or with a primary rela-
tionship,” Morgan said. “I can't do
that naymore. I need to spread my -
energy, not focus it. I've learned to
avoid preoccupying myself with a
job orp,a specific _relationship._” '

Another Collective member, an
English professor at a Pittsburgh
university. commented. “When. I’
reacha breaking point where myjob
is on my nerves, my home life is one
big noise, and l really begin to hate
myself. l find l can learn a lot from

LCB would have to be subsidized by

“Since l became chairman in

Pennick added. “Profits rig;ht now

Pennick said he has no plans right
now to fight the proposal.

“First of all, there's been no legis-

it’s mere talk. This is not the time to

What are the chances of such leg-

According to Hall, PPG’s training
program is designed to do just
that—help a person develop to his
full potential.

“As a company, PPG believes in
growth and promotion from
within," Hall said.

He estimated that only about 25
percent of new employees hired each
year by PPG are from other com-
panies. The rest are “brand new,

Confusion about the continuation
of adequate funding for state-

Full appropriations for Pitt were
delayed until the LCB delivered

“We figured in our budget a pro-

Arms Race Study Group Worries About NuclearThreat.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pill News Slall Writer

The Arms Race Study is worried
about the future. They’d like to
make sure there is one.

The group consisting of members
of the Pitt English Department and
faculty, seeks to approach the spec-
ter of the nuclear arms race with a
professional and personal interest in
informing each other and colleagues
about what they consider an increas-
ingly perilous world situation.

“lt’s frightening,” said Liane Nor-
man, associate professor of English
and one of the group’s founders.
“The notion of surviving a nuclear
holocaust is romantic. You can’t
defend yourself against nuclear wea-
pons. Once they’re launched, there is
nothing to stop them from hitting
their targets.”

With the first-strike defense poli-
cies of both the United States and
the Soviet Union, the increasing
reliance on complex. technological
military apparatus and warning sys-
tems that are not immune to malfun-
ctions, and a general lowering offear
about the realities of a nuclear war,
the group is meeting to discuss ways
to not only heighten awareness, but
also cause change through its
actions.

Such actions, according to Nor-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 25, 1981

man, could include using the profes-
sional status of the group to make a
statement about the issue as a uni-
versity committee, advocating the
political unacceptability of nuclear
arms to leaders, and trying to influ-
ence other professional organiza-
tions, inside and outside of academe,
through discussion and professional
literature.

Norman said the group may also
attempt to use its leverage to influ-
ence the Pitt board oftrustees, espe-
cially those members directly
involved with military-contracted
firms, to. stop all involvement.

“Pittsburgh is the corporate head-
quarters of three of the top I0 mil-
itary contractors in the
country—-Gulf, Westinghouse and
Rockwell. Rockwell is deeply
involved with the controversial MX
missile system project,” said Nor-
man. “Pitt also has military con-
tracts, mainly for research and
development, from the government,
including a big contract to compile
research in anti-personnel cluster
bombs.”

According to Norman, the Pitt
Arms Race group is loosely modeled
after the Physicians for Social
Responsibility, a group of doctors
who specialize in stress-preventive
medicine. That group, which origin-
ated in Boston and later spread

nationwide, advocates a stance
against nuclear proliferation, des-
cribing it as a conflict with their pro-
fessional commitments as doctors to
prevent injury and preserve life. In
the event of a nuclear war, even one

i of limited strikes, the large number

of casualties that would occur would
be beyond the aid of existing medi-
cal facilities and professionals.

The Pitt study group has essen-
tially adopted this same stance as
professionals against nuclear arms.

“We, as English professionals,
worry about the preservation and
permanence of language, and the
future. Our group is against any-
thing that can acerbate the arms
race," said Norman. “l think it’s an
appropriate activity for scholars to
worry about civilization and pre-
serve it. The arms race threatens
what we care about as professionals
and personallyjeopardizes all of us.”

Opposition to nuclear prolifera-
tion is certainly nothing new—it has
existed since the inception of nuclear

’ weapons, and their subsequent use

at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ‘But
Norman and many others fear that
time is running out.

“The world is in more peril now
than when the first atomic bomb was
exploded,” said Norman. “The Uni-
ted States and Soviet Union have
both refused to say they won’t strike

first with nuclear weapons. With the
extremely accurate weapons now
available, each side is moving away
from a simple deterence policy to
targeting cities and military bases.”

The U.S. political outlook is also

-an area of concern to the study

group, said Norman. Before former
President Jimmy Carter left office,
he reiterated the U.S. defense policy
of targeting military centers and cit-
ies and the first-strike philosophy.
Two weeks ago, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig said it was impor-
tant to “keep the Russians off-
balance.” In President Reagan's
across-the-board budget trimming,
defense and military spending was
one of the few areas where funds
were not cut.

Opposition to the arms race has
traditionally protested against what
it calls the “distorting effects” that
extremely high military spending
has on economies by producing a
product that has no utility. The
result, the argument asserts, is a dis-
tortion of the political processes
where huge amounts of spending by
the government and a larger and

* larger area of decision-making is

taken over by the military without

the opportunity for public debate.
“It has become very profitable to

manufacture death,” said Norman.

ing the percentagepaid to the manu-
facturers, has been estimated at a
cost of $l08 billion, or about $l,200
for each taxpayer in the United '-
States." i

The study group also is concerned
with emphasizing that nuclear war is
neither unthinkable nor likely to
stay limited in scope.

“There is this comforting notion
of limited strikes, but there are no
guarantees that such a clash will stay
limited,” Norman said. “Such a
belief relies on rational checks on
behavior and discounts outrage.
There is really no check on escala-
tion and, even ifstrikes were limited,
the casualties would still be
extremely high."

Compounding the dangers of a -
first-strike policy is the possibility of
mistakes in the complex computer
systems that nations now use to
monitor against attacks and control
their defensive arsenals. According
to Norman, the Pentagon recently
admitted to 38 accidents—o,r
“broken ‘arrows”—that occurred in
our military computer systems,
including three in the last year.

ln one incident, an alert was
started when a 49-cent component
malfunctioned. In another case, a
computer war game gotmixed up
and started an alert which went on
for seven minutes before the error
was detected.

_ Other aspects of the possibilities V
of nuclear was assume an aura of .
science fiction bordering on the uni- -
maginable. ln his book, “The
Nation,” E.P. Thompson states that
one pound of enriched plutonium, if
disseminated over the world,-could
cause cancer in every person on
earth. Each nuclear reactor, on the.

, average, produces about 400 pounds

of enriched plutonium annually, _ ‘ ’
said Norman, and experts still know A
no complete safe way to dispose of '-
this waste. a ,
The Arms Race Study Group has  
not decided yet on any specific plans .' i.‘ ‘
of action, but Norman personally
favors a moratorium on the produc-- 
tion, testing, -and developmenfof -‘i 
nuclear arms until. “we ﬁgure out" 
what to do with the ones we’ve got.”  V ”.
“We've reached the point where, " 

the only solution is to stop.” said: 

Norman. “When war is relied on:

'there is little incentiye to try to think 0 ti i'i.”1

of something else.”

Memory Can Become A Tense Matter

By MARY CALLAHAN

PM News Staff Writer

We’ve all heard it at one time or
another. the idea that the human
animal utilizes only l0 percent ofits
overall mental capacities. It always
leaves one feeling a bit ashamed and
resolute about expanding vocabu-
lary or tackling Portuguese.

3- And now, as ifthe burden of guilt

‘Ev

“~/

is not already enough to bear,
researchers are concluding that they
have grossly overestimated us all
these years. New evidence indicates
that the figure is actually more in the
neighborhood of one percent.

To understand this better, try to
imagine assimilating [000 bits of
information every second of life
from birth to old age. Conceivably,
our brains hold the potential for
such storage.

By ‘now you may be saying to
yourself, “But 1 have a‘ memory like
a sieve. l’m terrible with faces and
dates and for the life of me, 1 can
never recall the names of King Lear’s
daughters.” lf you are like most eve-
ryone else, chances are that there is
nothing wrong with your mind,

you’ve just fallen into the trap of"
underestimating its power.

According to Peter Russell, psy-
chologist and author of The Brain
Book. people vastly underrate their
memories.

“If were introduced to 20 people
at a party, we expect to remember

V five of those people, at best. And

that," according to Russell, “is all we
will remember because we don’t try
_to do much more." He says that it is
a matter of‘mind set,’ and living up
to our expectations or lack of them.

Even though most of our memo-
ries are inaccessible and beyond our
ability to summon them at will, quite
a bit of evidence shows that we never
actually forget anything. With the
help of artificial brain stimulation,
hypnosis and such natural stimuli as
smell, sight or sound, certain recol-
lections can be randomly triggered.

ln the 1940s, a Canadian neuro- '

surgeon, Wilder Penfield, con-
ducted experiments in which weak
electrical currents were passed over
the various regions of the human
brain. When the current touched on
the “hippocampus" area, the sub-
jects were suddeny jerked into fam-

iar scenes from their past. One
woman was taken back to her child-
hood neighborhood where she could
hear a neighbor calling her son.
When the probe was slightly shifted,
she vividly recalled a carnival scene
from years before.

The hippocampus is a small,
twisted portion of the cerebral hem-
ispheres which lies tucked away in
the temporal lobes on either side of
the head near the cars. It seems to be
responible for our long-term
memory process. When both sides
are injured or removed, as they were
in the early hit-and-miss days of epi-
lepsy treatment, the subject loses all
ability for recollection and becomes
forever trapped in a kind of sus-
pended infancy. Some old habits are

retained, but no new learning can.

take place. One such epileptic

patient who received this radical\

treatment suffered new grief each
time he was told that a favorite uncle
had died. He could retain no
memories. ' ‘
So how does memory work? As of
yet, there is no set answer, although
most scientists will agree that there
are two types of memory formation.

Short-term memory includes such
things as memorizing a phone
number and then forgetting it as
soon as it is dialed. The short-term
process does not seem to involve the
protein synthesis that occurs with
the long-term memory commitment.

The long-term memory seems to
cause an actual physical change
within the brain. In one experiment,
rats were taught to run through a
simple maze and upon mastery of
the lesson, were immediately cooled
down to five degrees centigrade,

' thus halting all electrical activity in

the brain. When the animal was
‘thawed out’ unharmed, it was again
introduced to the maze and it
showed no signs of recognizing the‘
pattern.

lf researchers waited a fairly_long
time between the learning expe-
rience and the cooling, the rat was
able to remember the maze. This led
the researchers to conclude that the
short-term memory involves only
ongoing patterns of nerve impulses,
while long term is a lasting structural
change in the pathways of the cells.

When taken in prescribed
amounts, certain drugs‘ have

memory-enhancing qualities. The
caffeine in the coffee that gets you
through finals week is one such sub-
stance, as are strychnine, Metrazol
and amphetamines. These artificial
stimulants work in the same manner
as the hormones produced by the
body. Any experience that causes
fright or excitement will release
adrenalin and other hormones into
the system. These stimulants help to
chemically imprint the incident in
our minds.

For instance, most of us do not
have a sharp recollection of the his-
torical -dates that we learned as
children, but if you ever stood in
tongue-tied agony while a teacher
quizzed you on the year of the

. Magna Carta signiﬁg, chances are
good that I215 will always stand out
in your mind. - .

Likewise, in the course of study-
ing, you may come across a certain
bit of information which you recog-
nize as signiﬁcant. This stimulus will

lead the body to release the approp- -

riate amount of hormones which, in

effect, “turn back”'on the body and ‘

reinforce the learning and memory.

Study Skills Workshop Offers Tips Forlmprovement

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

How often have you sat at your
desk in the evening and looked with
horror at the massive pile of books,
notes, and handouts? The feelings of
anxiety, frustration and despair
begin to well up inside you. Then,
getting a firm grip on your emotions,

you come to the logical conclusion-

that the only way you’ll make any-
thing out of yourself is to begin to
study. But then you say to yourself,
“Hey, l got to call my friends and
find out what’s happening this wee-
kend.” Or, “Oh no! The Dick Van
Dyke show is on now." and for the
true procrastinator, “Ahh, I'll do it
tomorrow.” You then spend your
evening at a relaxed pace that
amounts to doing nothing. We all
know that those escape mechanisms
lurk in our minds.

These are the problems that are

 ‘worked out at the University’s Study

Skills Workshops. The workshops

are a five-week series that meets _

once a week for two-hours, Each
week a specific skill is lectured on
and discussed.

The first week, a diagnostic test is
given to discover the student's wea-
knesses and strong points. The fol-
lowing weeks deal with:
concentration on note-taking,
memory and time management, test-
ing skills, and the final week finish-
es up with a survey to see how the
student progressed.

Georgine Materniak, who is in
charge of the workshop, said the ser-
vice handles from 500 to 600 stu-,
dents a term.

“And these people are not the stig-
matized college student who are on
the verge of flunking out,” said
Materniak. “Generally, it is the stu-
dent who is doing well. The average
QPA of the students who take the
workshop is between 2.5 and 3.5.
But these people seem to feel that"
they can do better, and that’s why
they come to us.” _ .

The problems that a student faces
while studying can usually be boiled
down to three maincauses:

Effort. Many times, a student
feels that the effort they’ve invested
in the past has not had desirable_

results. This could cause them to not .

want to study.

Career Selection.  student may
wonder if they are in the right field.
“Am I doing the right thing?” is the
statement used most often by stu-
dents. Another problem may be that
the student has enrolled in a course
that is beyond his capacity. -

Personal Problems. The student
could be going through soul-
searching that must be done. Prob-
lems with a romantic or family
relationship could make other prob-
lems seem trivial. _

“When a student comes in, we
have to be very ﬂexible. lf we find in
talking with the student that they
have a problem that the workshop
isn’t equipped to handle, then we'll
refer them to the appropriate place
in the university.”

Materniak also said the workshop
tries to deal with the student as a
whole person. - - ~

“Many skills we teack students
comes out of‘cognitive psychology.
What weiteach students is how to
abstract ideas and memorize themin
a way that the student can accept.

47 Years Overdue

In order to improve service to the commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Gov. Richard Thornburgh has proposed a
change-over from the present state-controlled liquorddsystem
to one that would place liquor sales in the hands of private
enterprise. In comparison to the system currently existing in
the state, the switch of liquor to private enterprise seems long
overdue.

Alterations accompanying the proposal to the system will
be of major advantage to the commonwealth consumer.
Some of the key changes will be:

—public access to liquor stores would be more readily
available. '

—while liquor and wine would be the primary business,
private retailers could offer liquor-related supplies.

—private retailers would be permitted to advertise, prom-
oting competition in liquor sales.

—this competition would take place due to the retailer’s
option of setting his own price on the product, since the state
would only control the wholesale price.

Although the number of retail outlets in the state would be
limited by market conditions, local option and license
requirements, the number of liquor stores would increase.
Right now, many of the State Stores are poorly located and
inaccessible to many consumers.

Also, purchasing liquor could be done with greater ease.
The consumer would be able to browse and serve them-
selves. Under private ownership, the retailers could provide
a more varied selection of liquors, as well as a variety of
liquor supplies (i.e. decanters,.drinking glasses, ice). '

Liquor and wine would ﬁnally be treated in this state like
regular products. The consumer would be able to price and
compare before they purchased, something that they can’t
do under the current system.

As stated earlier, the 47-year control of liquor by the state
has been 47 years too long. There is fear, however, that the
state would forfeit a large chunk of money contributed to the
treasury every year by State Stores. Reports from Thorn-
burgh’s office state that under the new system, the state
would still receive almost the same amount of monies. How _
this is-to work is not particularly clear. But the need to
convert the liquor business into just that, a business, is
something that Thornburgh is ﬁnally taking properly into
hand.

On Journalism

The policy of The Pitt News is not one of sensationalism,
nor does itever intend to be.

The photo of Wesley Posvar on the front page of the
Monday, Feb. 23 The Pitt News is not unlike any front page
photo. The purpose of a front page photo is that of slanting
for a deliberate visual effect. It is that way with every photo.
The editors make their photos as large and striking as possi-
ble to grab the attention of the reader. As for cropping
techniques, the photo was run as taken.

The ﬁle for the Posvar-CIA_ story contained a text of
approximately 43 documents, ranging from the three re-
printed in their entirety to in-house CIA memorandum,
correspondence from other universities, itineraries and re-
prints of related news and magazines articles. The chosen
re-prints were run in their complete, unedited form as more
proof of existence. While it is not a coloring of the news, it is
debatable whether it is a coloring of its physical

_ presentation. .

Regarding the question of investigative journalism, The _'
Pitt News follows its policies dictating editorial integrity.
However, we are college journalists and, in many ways, are‘
much more, limited in resources and experience. This is not

‘to be construed as an excuse—just a circumstance. ltis our .

AQuestioning of the Ethics

By WENDY WAREHAM
Pitt News Managing Editor

If it weren’t so serious, it would be
funny. j g

If public opinion in regard to the
credibility of the media were not
already so low, the article concern-
ing Chancellor Posvar and the CIA
in the Feb. 23 issue of The Pitt News
could be disregarded as a shoddy
attempt at investigative reporting.

Unfortunately, it’s not that easy to
change public opinion.

I suppose the point of the article
was to point out Posvar’s questiona-
ble ethics regarding university-CIA
involvement. '

I think it is ironic that this point

was so lavishly made at the expense’

ofjournalistic integrity, for the fol-
lowing reasons:

If the purpose of the media is to
provide accurate, unbiased informa-
tion, then the choice of the photo-
graph on the front page and the
laughable job of cropping most
effectively defeated that purpose.

The questionable ethics, I think, lie
in this deliberate slanting of the
initial visual effect of the page--an
effect which could have been
nothing other than intentional.

The sensational effect of repro-
ducing the documents (or portions
of them) was exactly that-—
sensational. Sensationalism _has
long been an accusation directed
toward the media that must con-
stantly be refuted. In this case, I
think the accusation isjustified. The
content of the documents in no way
necessitated their reproduction.

As far as regarding the article as
investigative journalism, it would

take an extreme stretch ofthe imagi- ~

nation, no matter how ﬂexible, to
classify the story as such. What was
investigated? Was the CIA con-
tacted? Was the organization- who
filed the suit contacted? Were any of
the other university presidents con-
tacted? If so, where is it stated in the
article that they were either inter-
viewed or contacted and refused to

comment?

The media has an indispensable
role in our society. It also has
responsibilities to fulfill: providing
accurate information and providing
it in an objective manner are two of
the more vital. It is unfortunate that

/2?;

poor examples of journalism, such'Z9'l'

as the one mentioned, make it neces-
sary for journalists to constantly
defent their profession.

My purpose here is not to rip The
Pitt News as an organization. The
issues I have approached have
already been discussed at length
among its members. While some of
us hold opposing viewpoints, we
also recognize the right to freely
express our points of disagreement.

My purpose lies in pointing out to
readers some possible points of
debate.

In the arena of ethics, no one is
exempt. And in this country, at
least, the pri_vilege of developing our
own code ofethics, as well as criticiz-
ing others, is secure.

Conversely, extreme stress and
tension will inhibit retention. For
instance, you may not recall the
color of a car that struck your car or
the face of a mugger. For this rea-

learning ability.

shows that the “pressure doesn’t

to be done. But instead, it looks fora
more relaxed environment that
allows them to maintain a consis-
tency in their work.

The teachers ofthe workshops are
students themselves. They were usu-
ally in the same situation as the peo-
ple who are taking the course. This
allows them to relate to the students’
problems in an open atmosphere.

“We want to give the students a
strong base to work with so that they

from the student is a commitment —
to give us a chance. If they give us
that, they‘ll see results,” said

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Snnrts Writer

It was by far the most impressive
victory the Pitt Panthers have had
this year. They had beaten Eastern
Kentucky and Delaware State by 36
points each earlier in the season, but
at the Curry Hicks Cage in Amherst,
Mass. last night, Pitt whipped the
Massachusetts Minutemen l0l-6l
in front of a sparse crowd of about
2,000 people.

The Panthers were totally domi-
nating throughout most ofthe game
as they were led by Sam Clancy,
Dwayne Wallace and Clyde
Vaughn. Clancy had 24 points, Wal-
lace 22 points and Vaughn 21 to help
increase Pitt's conference record to
8-4 (I5-l0 overall) and keep it in

Massachusetts got off to a fast
start and led 5-0 after two and one
half minutes of play. But in an
incredible stretch that was to set the
vtone of the entire game, Pitt reeled
off nine points in only l9 seconds to
give it the lead for good.

A great season it has not been, an

The Big Time, is sporting an ordi-

_Chipman, was brought in, a few
good recruits were landed, and Pitt
faithfuls were swearing this was
going to be Theiryear.

It still might- be. The Eastern 8
tournament is still up for grabs. But
for now,_a closer__look at Chipman’s

which reflects a coach's philosophy.
and his ability to improvise in game
situations.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 25, ]g81g

By MARIE HUFF

Pill News Sports Writer

Members of the Pitt community
should pray that Panther quarter-
back Dan Marino rebounds from
his knee injury as well as Pantherette
junior Carol Dugan did. The 5-foot-
8 guard for the women's backetball
team suffered torn ligaments and
cartilage in her right knee during the
ninth game of the I979-80 cam-
paign, forcing her to miss the
remainder of the season. Dugan
finally returned to the Pitt lineup in
the second game this season, mark-
ing the end ofa long, dedicated--and
successful-—struggle back to the
hardwood floor. I

“When the doctors told me it
would be eight or nine months
before I could play again, it seemed
like an eternity,” Dugan recalled.
“First I got scared I’d never play
again, then I got depressed because]
wasn’t' playing and I couldn’t do
anything about it.”

Dugan’s former high school
coach, Russ Nightengale, was

instrumental in her comeback.
‘Nightengale wrote and phoned
Dugan last winter while she
attended classes at Pitt, encouraging
and reassuring her. When Dugan
returned to her home in Willowick,
Ohio for the summer, Nightengale
was there, offering his help.

“Coach Nightengale really
deserves a lot of credit for my
return,” explained Dugan. “He pre-
pared me mentally for the work
ahead and stood by me all the way.
He gave me a lot of confidence in
myself that I could and would play
basketball again.”

Dugan‘s daily rehabilitation pro-
gram demanded 30-45 minutes ofleg

exercises, a full Nautilus workout,‘

and an hour of swimming. Working
as a playground supervisor for her
second summer, Dugan was able to

‘put in extra time strengthening her
knee.

“I love working with the kids,”
said Dugan. “They‘re ambitious and
energetic, which was contagious.
They certainly kept my spiritsiup.”

Panlherette Carol Dugan rebounded from a serious injury to win a starting
job. » I I '

Determined Dugan Makes Come

Dugan, a studio arts major, pro-
vided the artwork for the Pitt
women’s basketball poster and the
cover of the 1979 media guide. She
also designed the T—shirts distrib-
uted at the I980 EAIAW Outdoor
Track Championships. Dugan cre-
dited her father, a cartoonist, for her
artistic ability.

“He has contributed so much to
my style and technique,” she said.
“He has helped me develop my work
by serving as my personal critic,
pointing out places for improve-
ment, and showing me how to
improve it.”

While Dugan acknowledged her
parents for building her self-
confidence and enriching her with
their wisdom, she credited her two
older brothers with some of her suc-
cess in basketball. ‘

“Jim and John used to play bas-

‘ ketba'll with me all the time. They

worked with me to sharpen my fun-
damentals, mainly my shooting and
dribbling,” recalled the Pantherette.
co-captain. “Jim especially taught
me the meaning of team play."

Dugan came to the Pantherettes
in 1978 after an impressive senior
year at East Lake North High
School. Playing the-strong-forward
position, Dugan compiled a list of
honors that included News Herald
AAA Player of the Year, first team
All-Greater Cleveland Conference,

, second team All-State, The Cleve-

land Plain Dealer Dream Team,and
first team All-District aswell as Dis-

trict Most Valuable Player.

As a freshman at Pitt, Dugan-was”
switched to the guard position,
which she had never played before.
Dugan adjusted beautifully and
went on to average seven ‘points a"
game despite a lower leg stress frac-
ture that forced her to miss a few
midseason games. Dugan also man-
aged to pull down 4.8 rebounds per
contest. ‘

' “Rebounding is one aspectfof the

game that I miss,” Dugan said,

“Playing under the board in high

0 I school, Idid a lot ofrebounfding and

I loved it.\ In college, I was too short
to play forward, so I was moved. to‘
guard. You don’t get many chances
to rebound from that position.”

Dugan did an excellent jobrof
transferring her aggressiveness to
her defensive. game, and last year in
the nine‘ games she played‘~as‘a

‘ sophomore, she had almost matched’

her‘ frreshman total in steals. This
year, Dugan is‘coach Judy Sauer’s
key defensive player.

“Carol has been a great asset to
our defense," said Sauer. “I know I_
can depend on her to come off the
bench when ‘we need her, an_d she
will do thejob.”

4%’

Carol Dugan

According to Sauer, Dugan was
slowing worked back into the
lineup.

“We usedvher sparingly at first,"

.. Sauer. explained, “just to make sure

. her knee would hold out. She has

done an excellentjob for us, and has

worked her way. into the starting
lineup." I

Dugan’s statistics at Pitt are not as
impressive as the onesshe. compiled
in high school. Rather, they show
her struggle with injuries during her
firstitwo seasons and reflect that she
has been inserted for defensive pur-
poses in this, her comeback season.
The statistics also show that Dugan
is a team-oriented player.

“The team is my No. 1 priority
when we’re on the floor, not me,”
Dugan said. “The best win for me is
a team win, where everyone contrib-
utes, and we__ work together like a

=smooth—running machine.”

Coach Sauer had more praise for
Dugan. _ '
“Carol Dugan is poised both on
and offthe court," she said; “She is a

positive and versatile leader and she

is very coachable.”

Dugan was originally recruited
and‘ coached by former Pitt mentor
Jean Balthaser, who left Pitt to
accept a coaching job at Connect-ii-.
cut. Duganwelcomed Sauer and her

switch to an aggressive styleof team ‘

play. _ V , . _ -
“Coach Sauer uses a lot of _differ-

ent offenses and‘ defenses," said” .,

Dugan. “She’s helped us to be better
individual rplayers, which helps the
team work better as a unit. .She's a
very intelligent and dynamic coach.”

When Dugan walks onto the
court, with a Lennon-Hill brace
'wrapped around .the middle half of
her leg to support he; knee, she is an
‘inspiration. She is not only a symbol,
of determination, she is a symbol of
dedication and success. ‘

Free Agent Dispute May Delay Baseball Season

By The Associated Press

‘TAMPA, Fla. AP-The Major
League Players Association meets
here Wednesday to consider the next
step in an escalating war between
baseball owners and the union over
free-agent compensation.

Every indication is that the play- I

ers will set a strike date in response
to the move last week by the owners
to alter the free-agent reserve
system.

Management wants clubs losing
what it terms_ a “premier" free agent
to be compensated with a profes-

sional player from the free agent's .

new team. The union claims that will
place unreasonable restriction on
the bargaining power of free agents.

The issue nearly caused a player
strike last may and only when it was
separated from the rest of the basic
agreement was a settlement reached
on a four-year contract outlining
basic working conditions for major
league players. A committee was
created to try and solve the trouble-
some compensation question with
Frank Cashen of the New York
Mets and Harry Dalton of the Mil-
waukee Brewers representing man-
agement and Bob Boone of the
Philadelphia Phillies and Milwau-
kee’s Sal Bando sitting in for the
players. /

.Th_e- Pitt iI§[e_u2"s“, Wednesday, _Feb_r_u§1ry 25, 1981

The committee held several meet-
ings but was unable to resolve the
question and management moved
unilaterally last week, putting its
compensation proposal into place.

Earlier this week, Boone and
Bando issued their report and
recommendations on the question
and they will formally present that
material to the union's executive
board Wednesday.

In their report, Boone and Bando
said there was no evidence of any
damage caused by the currect free-
agent system to warrent increased
compensation and that the proposed
change would affect the bargaining
power and mobility of all players.

“Major league baseball players
ought to have the same rights as
other Americans who, after an
employment contract expires, are
free to seek work elsewhere on the

' best terms they can negotiate, with-

out any new employer being
required to pay ‘compensation’ to
the former employer,” the Boone-
Bando report said. “The manpower
compensation scheme put forward
by the owners would violate that
basic right.”

Current compensation calls’ for an .
amateur draft choice. Management t

has claimed that is insufficient.

. The player report indicated a wil-
Imgness to consider changes in the

compensation clause but pointed
out that any such changes would
have to be consistent with the clubs,”
“stated ‘aims in seeking such
changes, i.e., to increase ‘equity’
without adversely affecting the bar-
gaining power of any free agent.”

The current plan doesn’t fit those
restrictions as far as the players are
concerned.

The report calls for continued
negotiation with management over

the issue but adds that ifa mutually
satisfactory settlement cannot be
reached, “both the players associa-
tion and the owners should abban-
don, for the remaining life of the
basic agreement, all
changes in the reserve system."

player who scored 20 points against
Delaware State, then played all of
three minutes against Rhode Island.
chipman has‘ openly berated

Vaughn on the sidelines during
games. At the Rhode Island game, »
Chipman was overheard by one of
Vaughn's high school teammates, as
saying, “If you can shoot so well,
then why did you miss that shot.”
Certainly no confidence there.

Both Beatty and Vaughn have
been yanked from games the minute
they “make a mistake. Remember
these aregfreshmen who will make
mistakes, but taking them out after a
mistake is certainly no ego booster.
Both players have been known’ to
look at the bench after a mistake,
fearing a substitution. This has
partly resulted in their timid play at
times, and lack of confidence in their
abilities. I

Along the same lines, Chipman I
has almost totally ignored veterans »
Olinger and Gissendanner.rOlinger,
a senior, has been a consistent scorer
and smart player in his career but is
now relegated to the bench. If any-
thing, Oliriger has experience and
intelligence and not using him has
been a waste of,his talent.

,At the second Pitt-Duquesne
game, a writer who also coaches
summer leagues in the Pittsburgh
area elbowed another writer as Dar-

 

rell Gissendanner was put in the
game. “Watch this,” he said. “watch
Ginnendanner harrass the

Duquesne guards. Sisinne or Dixon ‘

are no match against his quickness.”
He was right. '

Gissendanner against the,

Duquesne guards was no contest.
The Pitt’ junior harrassed, shadowed
and made a shambles of the Dukes
backcourt men. Then he was taken
out of the game much to his disbe-
lief. Surely, Gissendanner, the
quickest Panther, has a right to

expect to play. He is no doubt very .
hungry and, although he tends to get,

a little out of control, he can contrib-

ure with more by playing. Keeping '

him on the bench is just wasting his
talent. _

It has not been all negative in
Chipman’s first year. In all fairness,

he has put a competitive team orithe '

floor, a team which has come within
a few missed free-throws ofi_bea'ting
Maryland and Rhode Island.

The final verdict is still out on Dr.
Roy Chipman, but his first year, so
far has been a disappointing one

because of all the high expectations. I 
’ With the team’s best players gra-- ’ ‘

duating, Chipman is going to have

to recruit hard to put together a '_
team that even approximates the‘ '
ability of this year’s team on the 3

After 15 interviews with various com-
panies, I finally found MITRE. And after 15
interviews I definitely knew what I was look-
ing for when I saw it.

I had to have breathing room. A place
that would turn me loose and let me work on
different kinds of projects. On the other
hand, I had to know I'd be able to turn to
other people for advice and backup. And I
definitely wanted a steady growth situation.

With the MITRE people, I knew right
away I’d found it all.

At any given time, they have some 75
or so funded, significant programs involving
several hundred separate projects and 1
tasks. And because they're Technical Ad-

visors to the Air Force's Electronic Systems,

Division in Command, Control and Com-
munications (C3), they design and develop

some of the world's most advanced informa-

tion systems.
Still, MITRE,handles every assignment

as if it were the only one. Because they have
to come up with the right solution every time.

That's their product. _
The best of MITRE to me is that they’ll
let me move from project to project if I want,

or get deeply involved in a longer-range one.

There's always something waiting for me.
I'm glad it took 15 interviews to get to

MITRE. Now when I say l.cho_se them, I

know exactly what I'm talking about.
