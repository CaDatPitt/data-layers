New President Pledges
S GB Watchdog Role

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Josh Baylson was sworn in as
Student Government Board presi-
dent Monday night and pledged his
administration would serve as a
watchdog for administrative poli-
cies here.

Baylson and six other recently
elected board members were
inaugurated in the Student Union
Ballroom before a crowd that
included several high-ranking Pitt
administrators and trustees.

“We shall be watchdogs,”
Baylson told the audience, “eyeing
the administration’s policies; a task
that has become increasingly
arduous with the onset of retrench-
ment in higher education.”

The new SGB head said the ard
would aim to improve itt’s
educational quality. “This task is
the board’s greatest challenge and I
think of none other that we would
await as anxiously,” he -said.

Baylson served‘ as a board
member this year before defeating

Jeff Barent and Max Lash for the
SGB’s highest elected position.

He succeeds Bernie Payne, who
administered the oath of ofﬁce at
Monday’s thirty-minute ceremony.

In his speech, Baylson compared
students to artists, saying “We can
be successful and create master-
pieces, or we can err and create
canvasses that insult our aesthetic
appreciation.

“But like true artists,” he added,
“we can conﬁdently re-cover our
canvasses because of the academic
freedom and security this Univer-
sity provides.”

Baylson’s prepared statement

" followed a parade of speakers,

including Edward Bozﬂiki, executive
assistant to the Chancellor, and
William Marcus, acting vice
chancellor for student affairs.

Also inaugurated were Dave
Hesidence (for his second term),
Diane Behers, Stan Galanski, Jan
Medoff, Bernie Popko and Sharon
Starzynski.

Grade .‘In fIaiion' Over,
Two Administrators Say

By ROBIN L. HAMPTON

Contrary to the current nation-
wide trend, grade inﬂation has been
decreasing at Pitt, two University
administrators say. Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg noted that the “QPA is
dropping.’ ’V

College of Arts and Sciences
Dean Robert Marshall said, “The
crest came a couple of years ago and

. grades have started going ddwn.

Inﬂation is over, deﬂation is taking
place.” ”

During the late 60’s and early to
mid 70’s there was considerable
controversy over grade inﬂation.
Some of the causes cited were:
faculty becoming more lenient
toward grading; pressure not to fail
students eligible for the draft; and
course requirement options given to
students by professors.

Rosenberg described grade in-
flation as ‘ ‘an assignment of a given
grade for work of lower quality than
was required for that grade at a
previous time.” However, he
deﬁned grade deﬂation as “work of
constant quality receiving a lower
grade ”

C inside . . .

Marshall said concern over grade
inﬂation may have stimulated talk
about reinstating, plus/ minus grad-
ing in CAS. ‘ ‘Many faculty felt that
the plus/ minus would contribute to
ending grade inﬂation by making it
easier to differentiate among
students without making the
difference of one whole unit.”

Plus/ minus grading returned to

Johnson: The Final Curtain

ByBETSYNORMAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Although the ﬁnal curtain of the
Sharon Johnson sex discrimination
case ofﬁcially closed on August 1
when U.S. District Court Judge
William Knox handed down a

90-page decision favoring Pitt, the
drama didn’t end until 5 p.m.
Friday.

At that time, Pitt officials
disavowed a previous claim of
ownership on several pieces of
Johnson’s laboratory equipment
and allowed movers to remove them
from Scaife Hall.

Knox’s decision upheld Pitt’s
move to deny Dr. Johnson tenure in
Pitt medical school, forcing Johnson
to seek employment for herself and
a home for her National Institute of

s Health grant. Johnson subsequent-

ly accepted a research and teaching

position in the chemistry depart-

ment of Brooklyn Polytechnic
Institute of New York, beginning
today.

Before any of the equipment
could be removed, Johnson had to
submit a list of the equipment she
wished to transfer. Pitt’s Depart-

reviewed the list and found several
items owned by the University.

Johnson claimed since her NIH
grant provided 80 percent of the
money used to purchase the $12,000
piece of equipment, she was the
rightful owner.

Pitt prevented movers from
taking any of the equipment Friday
demanding Johnson give up the
spectrophotometer. The battle

Give ROTC
Accreditation,

Council Told

By KARENKADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

College of Arts and Sciences
Council members met with ROTC
representatives Monday [for dis-
cussion on possible accreditation for
ROTC courses.

Representatives from both the
Army and Air Force programs here
presented to Council fact sheets
citing, among other things, the
goals and curriculum of ROTC.

ROTC accreditation has been a
subject of controversy ever since it
was ended in the late 1960’s.

The representatives told Council
members ROTC students have
complained that they must take 16
additional credits for a total of 136 to
meet graduation requirements.

ROTC representative Scott
Wagner said cadets are often forced
to take extra courses in the spring
and summer to avert course
overloads.

“This often runs into monetary
problems,” Wagner said. “We are
forced to take extra credits—at $43

per credit—during the spring and :

summer terms, without the promise
of getting any accreditation. It
seems unfair.”

Tim O’Neil, another ROTC
representative, said Pitt could
possibly draw students from other
area universities like Carnegie-
Mellon and Duquesne where ROTC
credits already are given.

“This would seem to be a way of
building up what appears to be
declining enrollment figures,”
O’Neil said.

Rizzo on the Silver Screen

PHlLADELPHIA—Mayor Frank Rizzo is in the movies, and he
isn’t pleased.

Rizzo, the former police commissioner whose tough-as-nails,
no-holds-barred personality has made him either a hero or a villain
to most Philadelphians, is featured in “Amateur Night at City Hall:
The Story of Frank L. Rizzo.”

It’s a 75-minute documentary produced by Heidi Trombert and
Bob Mugge, with whom Rizzo refused to cooperate. It will open
here Feb. 8 as a beneﬁt for the American Civil Liberties Union.

“The mayor was always polite and elusive,” Ms. Trmbert said.
The documentary, which has little new information about Rizzo, was
gathered from network footage purchased by the ﬁlm makers,
Rizzo’s public appearances, interviews of the mayor’s supporters
and detractors and shots of the ethnic neighborhoods of the city.

Soviet Satellite Search Continues

EDMONTON, Alberta—A Canadian nuclear response team
headed for Canada’s Great Slave Lake yesterday to recover from the
ice’ two tiny, potentially hazardous pieces of a nuclear-powered
Soviet spy satellite located electronically.

Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board spokesman Roger Eaton
told a new conference earlier the two fragments were giving off
radiation that could be dangerous to living beings exposed at close
range for a number of hours.

The latest fragments from the satellite, which fell from orbit Jan.
24, were located near the Reliance weather station on the northeast
end of the frigid lake about 240 miles east of Yellowknife, capital of
the Northwest Territories.

On Saturday two members of a group retracing a 1927 explorer’s
route found the first satellite debris at Warden’s Grove, a remote
Artic weather outpost 150 miles northeast of Reliance.

United Nations legal experts said the language of U.N. treaties
would make the Soviet Union liable to pay compensation both for
damage caused by the satellite and the cost of tracking down debris
and radiation sources.

New Fuel From Old Oil?

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Used motor oil, the slimy liquid that
makes engine maintenance messy, may one day go from crankcase
to fuel tank, saving energy and the environment. .

“We’re taking that dirty, used lube oil, filtering out any water and
large particles of contamination and mixing it with diesel fuel,”
explained researcher Samuel S. Lestz, a 45-year-old mechanical
engineer at Penn State.

Under a $190,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant, Lestz and
other researchers are exploring the idea of mixing lubricating oil
with fuel.

‘ ‘You can use it with very little treatment, ’ ’ he said. ‘ ‘And there’ s
no fuel tax on lubricating oil,” a fact which has made at least one
trucking ﬁrm unwilling to talk publically about its success with the
concept.

“We’ve been doing it for years,” said-the executive of a major
company that operates about 1,000 diesel trucks.

C. B. Champion Chosen

NEW YORK—-A bunch of ratchet-jawed, signal stoppers from as far
away as the Iceberg convoyed in the Big Lady to crack the whip
yesterday for the title of master modulator.

That’s CB talk for “A group of smooth talking, citizens’ band
radio enthusiasts from as far away as Anchorage, Alaska, gathered
in New York City to move their lips rapidly yesterday for the title of
top talker of the airwaves.’ ’

A. Robert Merrill, a welfare administrator for the Mormon

‘ Church in Utah, handled it best, outchattering ﬁve other ﬁnalists

for the national championship of the world of citizens’ band radio.
He won a new automobile, (equipped with CB of course), $5,000 for
personal appearances and a 10-day trip for two to London.

The ﬁnalists, survivors from a list of 17,000 entrants nationwide,
met in a New York hotel for the ﬁnals.

One by one, they were asked to report on the CB radio, ﬁrst, that
the highway on which they were traveling was tied up by a heavy
slick of vegetable oil, and, second, that King Kong had just attacked
the Empire State Building, creating a massive trafﬁc jam below.

Life From Within

WASHINGTON—An abundance of life has been discovered
inside rocks from a barren region of Antarctica—a surprising
ﬁnding that could change the way scientists search for life on Mars.

Discovery of microbes algae and fungi underneath the surface of
certain rocks in Antarctica, one of earth’s harshest environments,
signiﬁcantly extends the known limits of life on this planet and
offers new hope that some form of life may exist on desolate
neighboring worlds, scientists say.

The National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, cosponsors of the Antarctic research,
announced the ﬁndings Tuesday.

Drs. E. Imre Friedmann and Roseli Ocampo-Friedmann, a

I husband-wife team of biologists from Florida State University at

Tallahassee, found life in light-colored rocks from Antarctica’s Dry
Valleys region, a frigid, arid area mostly devoid of ice and snow.

Similar, but more extreme conditions were found on Mars by two
American Viking spacecraft, which in 1976 searched unsuccessfully
for conclusive signs of microbial life. But the unmanned craft were
not designed to crack open rocks and peek inside.

Students in Schenley Park continue to take advantage of the snow’s refusal to

melt.

CAS in March 1977, when the
Faculty of Arts and Science Council
approved a resolution allowing FAS
instructors to record plusses and
minuses on the grade sheet for
student’s transcripts.

A similar resolution had been
rejected by the College of Arts and
Sciences Council two years earlier
because of student opposition to
grading system, according to
Marshall.

The reasons for student opposi-
tion were: competition for grades
would be intensiﬁed; use of the
grading system by faculty would not
be uniform; and a tendency to use
more plusses than minuses would
promote ‘ ‘ grade inﬂation . ’ ’

Marshall recalled plus/minus
grading in 1964 and would estimate
about ten years since CAS

employed plus/minus grading. At
that time, plus/ minus grading was
~ phased Out more for “administra-
tive” than academic reasons.

PUBLIC NOTICE T O STUDENTS

Section 438 of the General Education Provision Act, as amended
by Section 513 of Public Law 93-380 and Section 2 of Public Law
93-568, referred to as the ‘_‘Privacy Rights of Parents and Students, ’ ’
(more commonly called the “Buckley Amendment”) requires that
the University of Pittsburgh give public notice to parents and
students of the following information. -

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of
students. In order to do so, these provisions are binding on the
University of Pittsburgh.

1. Individual student records should include only information
necessary and relevant to the educational purposes of the
institution.

2. Student records are open for inspection by students or their
parents upon request, with the exception that letters of
recommendation written prior to Jan. 1, 1975 remain conﬁdential.
Additionally, speciﬁc documents that students have waived their

- right to inspect remain conﬁdential.

3. Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.

4. The institution may not release student records outside the
institution without student consent, unless one of several exceptions
applies.

5. Requests external to the institution for information regarding
students should be documented, as should releases of student
information.

6. The University may establish categories of information known
as “Directory Information” and release this information upon
request by individuals external to the institution. This may be done
only after students are provided the opportunity to request
exclusion from the “Directory.”

Greater speciﬁcity and further information regarding exceptions
may be obtained in Room 104, Schenley Hall. Students also may
request information from the ofﬁce regarding the types of records
maintained, the custodian of records and the location of the ofﬁce
where records are maintained.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

After the Inauguration

The new Student Government Board, sworn in during
ceremonies Monday evening, takes office today. In his inaugural
statement, President Josh Baylson committed the new board to a
primary emphasis on academic affairs—-“knowledge through
scholarship,” he called it.

A concentration on academics at this point is well-timed and ap-
propriate. English competency, faculty evaluations and plus-minus
grading fall into this category; all of these are of importance and
interest to most students. ‘It is time to positively address and finally
resolve the controversies in these areas.

We hope, however, that the new board will not get trackedinto
one direction. During the campaign, members of the board also
committed themselves to solving problems in areas other than
academics. Commuter affairs, programming, the student assem-
bly, improved relations between the University and the Oakland
community: these issues and more deserve the attention of the
board. New initiatives must accompany the cleaning up of old
business.

Creativity, imagination and hard work are required if an effec-
tive lobbying effort is to be directed at Harrisburg. This year,
students here have learned the importance of political maneuvering
in the state capital, and we hope the new board will not forget the
lesson. Several ideas were put forth during the campaign-creation
of a permanent SGB lobbying committee, for instance. We think it
is important that the new board study the alternatives carefully and
come up with recommendations in the very near future.

Finally, in his speech Monday, Baylson lauded the “academic
freedom” at Pitt. The recent adventures of Paul Nyden and others
have raised-questions in this regard, and we look for Baylson and
the board to come through on his promise that they will be
“watchdogs, eyeing the administration’s policies.”

All things considered, we think the new board has the potential
to be a strong and effective force in student affairs during the next
year. We hope the members will have fulfilled that potential come
next January.

Letters to the Editor

Comments on the Recent “Abortion Issue”

The Jan. 23 issue of the Pitt News
is the best in recent memory, and,
as a frequent critic of the paper, I
am delighted to note your
improvement. However, I do feel
obliged to respond to points made in
the three articles on abortion. At the
outset, let me identify myself as
being limitedly pro-choice.

Gary Govert’s article points out
two important matters: Congres-
sional muddling through, and the
question of responsibility for the
consequences of intercourse. Con-
gress has dismised the question of
public responsibility———it was not
that Congress approved abortions

V After reading the article entitled,
“Grad Job Outlook: Engineers
Lead the Pack” by Rodney B.
Grifﬁth, the last two paragraphs of
the aﬁicle held the most amount of
interest. I am a black student soon
to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts
degree from Pitt.

The two paragraphs included
statements by Daniel Nagy of the

«Placement Service referring to

increases in company recruiters and
recruiting in liberal arts. I would
like to ask, “HOW?”

The University Placement Ser-
vice charges a minimum of three
dollars (not including the cost of
numerous copies of a personal
resume) to set one up with the
possibilities of recruitment inter-
views regarding that person's
major. How could Mr. Nagy make
the statement that was printed as,
“Even in those areas (liberal arts)
recruitment is up,” when about
eighty percent of the recruiters are
interested only in technical and
specialized ﬁelds, and a seemingly
poor emphasis is placed on liberal
arts recruitment?

I understand that the majority of
recruiters are basically after those
interested in engineering and
health-related professions, but that
is to be expected because Pitt does
not specialize in Liberal Arts as they
might like to have CAS students
believe.

More interest should be placed on
ﬁnding, informing and enlightening
liberal arts recruiters to form a
balance of recruiting at the
University. This would be much

more help to find the type of
possible employment offered in-
stead of getting the degree and bust
your behind looking blindly for
something that isn't there.

Liberal Arts should be parallel to
engineering and the like; after all, if
one examines closely, many of our
elected officials who help run this
country are probably degree
holders in liberal arts. .

belligerent sounding voices, only to
ﬁnd it is the Democrats arguing
with the Republicans over a card
game. The third floor is an
experience, not only for you to gain
legal skills from Legal Awareness,
or cheaper skiing rates through the
Ski Club, it’s a way for you to meet
people and learn a few things while
you are having fun. If all else fails to
attract you, at least consider the fact
that you can use it on your resume.

Try the third floor experience-
go into an ofﬁce, ﬁnd out about the
organization, attend a meeting,
introduce yourself to the members
and, if you like the experience, do it
again.

Now is the time; the term is just
getting started and most organiza-
tions are accepting new members.
Try the third ﬂoor experience.

that one could pay for out of pocket
so much as it was that Congress
preferred to think of the matter as
the last opportunity to assert that
people are ultimately responsible
for their condition of life. As for
bearing the responsibility for the
consequences of intercourse, it is
men who must learn to bear that
responsibility. It is not enough to
offer to pay for an abortion. Also, it
seems clear that even if both parties
take their responsibilities seriously,
a woman retains at least 51 percent
of the vote. Finally, no woman who
has borne a child, especially one
unplanned, unwanted, and one for
whom less thana modicum of food,
clothing and shelter can be
provided, needs any words about
bearing the consequences of her
act.‘Govert is right to assert that
men have abdicated their responsi-
bilities, but we must not think that
by accepting their responsibilities
men take away the power of choice
from women; rather they add to the
possibilties.

The ‘ ‘abortion of convenience’ ’ is
a straw-woman argument. No
abortion is convenient. It is painful,
debilitating, potentially dangerous
and expensive. Any idea that a
woman discovers herself pregnant,
runs to the doctor’s office for a
lunch-hour abortion, hurries back to

work and then dashes home to‘

prepare for her next lover’s tryst is
worse than untrue, it’s perverse.
This image of women having
abortions for convenience calls up
the spectre I have just outlined
althoughbit. is never really said.
Needless to say, it is profoundly
derogatory. What is at stake here is
one’s willingness to accept that
another view of the same facts may
have equal merit with one’s own.

Mary Winter’s testimony as a
oounselor corroborates Govert’s
thesis that men have avoided their
sexual responsibilities. But I ﬁnd
her article ill-conceived. Since
Winter is willing to say that a
woman must not idly decide the
course of her pregnancy, she must
allow that abortions may be
considered as rational alternatives.
Should a woman opt for abortion, it
does not follow that the decision is
the product of male dominance or
peer pressure. Abortion is not an
easy decision lightly made among a
plethora of choices, as Winter’ s own
experience should have demonstra-
ted.

That irresponsible or exploitative
people, and pro-choice people
happen to agree on the legal status
of abortion is not a happy fact, but
fortunately the positions may be
easily distinguished. The simple
2 1-‘ i’

N3A.Vmﬁ"-z«‘v-‘/III v-Val . lib . ‘.4 r.>“d”‘

fact that one group vpuld prefer
that abortions be available in order
to reduce the likelihood of their own
long-range commitment to child
rearing is enough _to distinguish it
from any pro-choice feminist
position. .

I will conclude by discussing
Maggie McKay’s article. It offends
me to hear the tired old saw about
the state upholding Christian theol-
ogy in refusing to loosen the purse-
strings for Medicaid-sponsored
abortions. First, not all abortion
opponents are Christians. Second-
ly, there are professed Christians
who support abortion, myself
among them. Thirdly, there are
Christians in pro-choice organiza-
tions-there are even Church
organizations that support the
pro-choice position; witness the
Religious Coalition on Abortion that
lobbies in State capitols and
Washington D.C. Fourthly, the
assumption made by all opponents
of abortion is that one is killing a
human being at great risk of one
sort or another to the mother. Every
religion and philosophy condemns
indiscriminate killing, some con-
demn any deaths at all. The issue in
the abortion debate is whether or
not the conceptus isa human being,
and that is a prior question. Finally,
it is not just a matter of educating
lower-class women and teenagers

vs

0-

about contraception when we talk-{W},

about serious alternatives to
abortion. Implicit in that view is the
notion that women must be warned
about a dread possibility.—-that is
not a feminist view. I would remind
McKay that it takes two to tango,
and focusing our efforts on women
may reduce pregnancies, but it will
not alter our current twistedview of
sex roles and sexual responsibili-
ties, nor will it improve our social
system, and these are feminist
concerns that transcend, but
include, a pro-choice position.

The Popular Prosecutors

By R. DAVIDTIVE

It is a widely accepted political
axiom in America today that the
people, in this post-Watergate era,
have lost faith in their governmental
institutions. A corollary to that
theory is that the people have also
lost faith in the politicians and
governmental leaders who run
those instiut-ions. There is,
however, one segment of govern-
ment, one group of politicians,
enjoying popularity unequaled in
recent history: the prosecutors.

The prosecutors, whether they
are of the “special” type, brought
in for one case, or just your basic,
everyday United States Attorney on
a white horse, are the American
saviors of the late 1970’s. These
men (note carefully the lack of
women. in this role) have been sent
to deliver us from the hands of the
politicians. They are the repository
of all that is good and right about
America, riding forth to do battle
with evil incarnate in the form of a
state senator.

Look at the cast of characters
involved. It runs from Archibald
Cox to Leon Jaworski to Richard
Sprague to Richard Thornburgh,
and includes the most recent
martyr, Saint Marston of the
Courthouse. Never in all American
history have so few put so many in
jail in so short a period of time. Or
so they would have us believe.

Now don’t get me wrong. Just
because I’m being sarcastic doesn’t
mean I think the prosecutors are
doing a bad job. They have put a
number of deserving criminals
behind bars. I’m even willing to
admit that one or two of the men I
named in that list might have been
motivated by something other than
personal ambition. Anything is
possible.

What I do object to is the role
those people have been cast in by
the American public. My sarcastic
references to knights and saints

were exaggerations, but not large
ones. Popular opinion really has
vested these men with all the
characteristics of good, and sent
them on a quest to rid us of the
enemy. Forgotten in all this is
Pogo’s poignant statement that,
“We have met the enemy and he is
us.” ,
I For a society where most of the
people profess to be moderate, we
are certainly given to extremes.
We overcompensate for everything.
In the 1950’s when we perceived
Communism as our prime enemy,
those who pledged to rid us of that
menace became our heroes.
McCarthyism, for a time, was a
virtue. In the 1960’s, internal
dissidents and radicals were the
enemy. The American people
overdid it in looking for someone to

. combat the threat. "The result was

Richard Nixon.

In both cases we overcompen-
sated in trying to find a solution to a
perceived problem. The problem

” now is ofﬁcial corruption. It would

be the height of folly and
irresponsibility to allege there is no
ofﬁcial corruption in this country.
We have ample evidence there is. I
would be just as irresponsible,
however, to let this obsession with
rooting out all the corruption get out
of hand.

Innocent people were destroyed
by the excesses of McCarthyism.
The same is true for some of the
victims of the Nixon reign of terror.
We may now, once again, be getting
to the point where the cure for
political corruption is worse than
the disease. _

Again, the excesses of a
supposedly moderate population
are at the root of the problem. Most
Americans either cannot, or will

not, see issues in terms of shadesgof '

gray. Everything must be all black
or all white. If one congressman
padded his payroll with call girls,
then they all have. If one aide to a
governor took a kickback, then they
all have.

The possibility that the rest of the
politicians in ofﬁce may be honest,
and be ﬁne public servants, is not
considered. I guess it just takes too
much effort for the average citizen
to separate the good from the bad.
Jt’s so much easier to stick
everybody with the same label.

This attitude has to rub off on the
prosecutors. They know strong
public support is one of the best
weapons they have. And they are
no better or no worse than any other
group of people. Some of them may

be in that business because of a

deeply held desire to root out «

corruption. Others may be in it
because of a deeply held desire to
get ahead and gain more power.
Just as we cannot paint all
politicians with the same black
brush, we cannot afford to paint all
prosecutors with the same white
brush.

We have to keep our perspective
on this issue. The strongest force
we have to combat official
corruption is an informed, concern-
ed analytic citizenry. The biggest
danger we have is not crooked
politicians, but a public that
overreacts, overcompensates and
puts blind faith in a small group of
individuals who are no better, or no
worse, than the rest of us.

Leslie Von HoutentAnd

The Charles Manson Gong

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Leslie Van Houten left jail last
month because California judges
decided she had not received a fair
trial seven years ago. Van Houten
had been jailed for murdering two
people, Rosemary and Leno La-
Bianca, an offense she admitted to
and even seemed proud of.

But Van Houten was a member of
the Manson family, and the
publicity over the slaughter of the
LaBiancas, actress Sharon Tate and
four others on her estate, influenced
public sentiment against Van
Houten and her co-defendants.

Possibly, one could say that
Leslie is less guilty than Susan
Atkins, Tex Watson and Patricia
Krenwinkle, since Leslie only
participated in the second slaying-
the others were involved in both.

- Possibly.

When Leslie started appealing
her case last year, Barbara Walters
interviewed her on “Goodnight
America.” Walters did not ask Van
Houten about her guilt or if she
regretted her actions, but Van
Houten did say that she was very
young at the time (she was 20), was
under the inﬂuence of drugs and
had since realized that Charles
Manson was not the omnipotent
leader she had thought him to be.

Isn’t that great‘? Van Houten has
had a change of heart. Since she is
not the terrible person she was
when she was originally locked up,
let’s let her out. Of course, it won’t
bring the LaBiancas back, but what
the hell,.you can’t have everything.
We have to be liberal about these
things, so if she wasn’t convicted
fairly, let’s let her out. She has
payed her dues; she even has that
little scar on her forehead from the
swastika she carved into it during
the trial. So what if she killed two
innocent people? Let’s welcome
Leslie Van Houten back to society.

Let’s not worry about the conduct
of other Mansonites like
“Squeaky” Fromme, who led the
family after Manson’s arrest until
she was caught trying to assassinate
Gerald Ford in 1975.

And we should ban prejudicial
movies like the made-for—television
ﬁlm, “Helter Skelter,” in which
transcripts from the actual trial
showed Van Houten and her friends
as bloodthirsty (literally; Atkins
drank Tate’s blood), inhuman
monsters, completely devoid of
conscience.

By the way, if Van Houten can
now go free how long before
Krenwinkle, Watson, and Atkins
follow suit? After all, where is our
sense of fair play?

How about Charles Manson
himself? Why not let Charlie out,
too?. After all, he merely ordered

the murders; he, did not participate
he only came up with the concept of
helter skelter so he could control the
world, as Hitler came up with the
concept of the Third Reich. It is a
question of who is guiltier—the
person with bloodstained hands or

the person with a bloodstained soul.
soul.

But that question isn’t an issue
here anymore because Leslie Van
Houten, like Lady Macbeth, cannot
cleanse her hands. And she's out on
the streets now.

Manson is up for parole this year.

Let’s let Charlie out, too. We don’t
have to worry. Vincent Bugliosi, the
prosecutor in the original trial,
might have some headaches. A
couple dozen Hollywood residents
like Terry Melcher, who owned the
Tate house and who crossed the
Mansonites, might have a few
fears. But we can rest assured that
the American form of justice will
prevail. '

Certain romantic notions not-
withstanding, the married student
at Pitt has much in common with
many unmarried undergraduates.

Marriage vows, contrary to some
ideas I had before I took them, do
not usher in a whole new lifestyle,
especially as far as being a student
is concerned. An unmarried com-
muter could, for instance, very
easily identify the way 1 live.
Recently, I’ve spent a lot of time
standing on street corners, my toes
slowly turning to granite, while bus
after bus has rumbled by, the doors
jammed shut by the press of human
bodies.

Like many commuters, I know
little about campus life. Ihave never
seen a Pitt dormitory room, and I
have no clear idea of where resident
students take their meals (The
Original?). Fraternities and soror-
ities are a source of confusion; my
wife, who knows about these things,
has to tell me which are which.
Fraternity parties conjure up
images of bizarre and mysterious
rituals in the eyes of a cultural
outsider like me.

I do, however, have some Contact
with resident undergrads-—
speciﬁcally those who work with me
on The Pitt News—and I’ve been
somewhat surprised at how much
notice they give my marital status. I

doubt if a newspaper deadline has
gone by without some comment
like, “Yeah, but you’re married.”
As if I ﬁt the stereotype.
Marriage, of course, does ‘do a lot
to separate one’s social life from
that of most undergraduates. My
wife and I attend relatively few
campus functions, other than an
occassional lecture or movie.

Undergrad Survives Student, Spouse Roles

at Pitt more than four years after I
graduated from high school, and
now that I’m stuck somewhere in
the administrative netherworld
between junior andsenior years, it
is sometimes difficult to watch my
contemporaries and friends already
embarking upon careers as lawyers,
doctors and Ph.D. candidates.
Marriage—and age, I suppose-

~.\.


it

also has done much to shape my
attitudes toward studying. My wife,
who graduated from Allegheny
College in 1974, claims I work
considerably harder than most
students, although I think she just
doesn’t pay attention when I'm
busy wasting time. Still, having a
wife who wants to go to graduate
school adds a measure of intensity
to one’ s career preparations—not to
mention the possibility of a family
coming along.

My joining the editorial staff of
The Pitt News last November
probably has presented my wife and
me with our greatest difﬁculty in
combining marriage and student-
hood. For me, it’s often a mad
scramble to study full-time, work 20
or so hours a week on the
newspaper, and still have time to be
a decent husband. For her, the long
hours I work can be rather lonely.

The kind of communication
needed to maintain a good marriage
relationship is often difﬁcult to pack
into the time we have together.
What with evening newspaper
deadlines and other commitments,
as well—church fellowships and the
like—we sometimes can only
manage one or two evenings a week
alone. It’s easy to feel like strangers
or to become “just friends” when
time together is so difficult to
budget.

Thus far, we’ve survived. As for
the future—another year of this,
and maybe then she can go to grad
school, while I work 9 to 5 as
editorial writer for the Mugwump
Gazette.

Birth ControlCIinics Offer Women Options

By PATRICIA GOURLEY

When Karen Johnson and two
of her friends went to Pittsburgh
Free Clinic five years ago, they were
scared.

“The three of us went together to
give each other courage,” said
Karen. “I was 17, Sue was 16 and
Michele was 16. We went to the
clinic because we didn’t want to get
pregnant.”

Every year, more women like
Karen and her friends enroll in
family planning programs in birth
control clinics across the United
States. Between 1968 and 1972, the
number of visits to government-
subsidized family planning centers
tripled. In 1972, 2,379 of the 3,099
U.S. counties had birth control
clinics that receive funds from local,
state and Federal agencies.

Pittsburgh has three birth control
clinics: Planned Parenthood
Association of Pittsburgh, Pitts-
burgh Free Clinic and Magee-
Womens Hospital Ob-Gyn Medical
Care Center.

Pittsburgh Free Clinic receives
funds from the Department of

Health, Education and Welfare, ,

through the Family Planning
Council of Western Pennsylvania.
The Public Health Trust Fund, the
State Department of Health,
Bureau of Auxilary Health ‘Services,
the Allegheny County Mental
Health/ Mental Retardation and
Educational Fund and the City of
Pittsburgh also provide funds to the
clinic. Private organizations ﬁnan-
cing the clinic are the Program to
Aid Citizen Enterprise, the Pitts-
burgh Foundation and the Hillman
Foundation.

Planned Parenthood’s McKees
Rocks and East Liberty centers
receive HEW funds, but its
downtown and Sewickley centers do
not.

The Ob-Gyn Center at Magee
Hospital is not Federally funded.
However, Allegheny County pro-
vides funds for the gonorrhea and
syphilis testing. The department of
hematology at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine
ﬁnances the clinic’s sickle cell
anemia screening.

All three clinics receive Federal
funds to reimburse them for their
treatment of medical assistance
patients. However, the clinics are
open to anyone.

To become a patient at any of
these clinics, a woman must call
ahead for an appointment. Pitts-
burgh Free Clinic and Planned
Parenthood will set up an appoint-
ment within two weeks of a call; at
Magee’s clinic, there is a ﬁve-week
wait. 1

The ﬁrst step of the new-patient
procedure at each clinic is a medical
interview, where the medical
history of the woman and her family
is recorded. This is important in
determining the best birth control
method. A recurring family illness
or disease may prohibit a woman
from taking the Pill.

This interview usually is followed
by a contraceptive education
counseling session, where a
counselor explains the female
reproductive system and how it is
affected by each contraceptive‘
method. The counselor displays
each birth control method available
at the clinic, how it is used, its
effectiveness, how it works and its
positive and negative side effects.
Available methods are the Pill,
diaphragm, intrauterine device
(IUD) and foam and condoms.
Sketches and models of the female
reproductive organs are used to
show the specifics of each method.
Finally, the counselor explains the
examination the woman will be
given, the instruments to be used

during the exam and what the
doctor or nurse practicioner will do.

No one form of birth control is
suggested asthe best method; a
woman is given the facts about each
method, so she can decide which is
best for her. She also is encouraged
to consider her family’s medical
history and how often she needs
protection. None of the clinics
suggest the use of foam and
condoms as a full-time contracep-
tive method, but encourage their
use as a back up method when a
usual method may not be fully
effective. During the session, the
responsibility of using contracep-
tives properly and of being

protected during every act of sexual '

intercourse is stressed.

“I didn’t have any idea of what 1

method I wanted,” said Christine
Murphy, 19. “I went to a Catholic
high school, so I didn’t even know
how each method worked. All I
knew was what the girls on my
(dormitory) ﬂoor had told me, whick
wasn't much more than, ‘I use this
or that.’ ”

Christine said that after the
education session at Planned
Parenthood’s downtown clinic, she
knew what she needed to make what
she feels was a wise decision.

“They took a group of us into a
room and went over everything,”
she said. “They had models, which
I feel was helpful. I liked having
other girls with me. One girl asked a
lot of questions, which made it
easier for me to ask questions.”

“The thing we liked best about
the education session,” said Karen
Johnson, now a senior at Pitt, “was
that they didn’t moralize. They
were a lot more thorough than (high
school) health class, too.”

After the counseling session, two
samples of the woman’s blood are
tested for syphilis and anemia, and
a urine sample is analyzed to

determine sugar level. A pap smear
is tested for cancer and a vaginal
smear is tested for gonorrhea. Then
a manual exam is given to check her
fallopian tubes, uterus and ovaries
and her breasts are checked for
lumps. A monthly self-breast
examination is encouraged, and she
is instructed to do it properly.

Karen said she feels the
examination was very thorough.
“The nurse practicioner was really
gentle, and she told me everything
she was doing. Before she used the
speculum (an instrument to dilate
the vagina for examination) she told
me what it was and what she used it
for.”

‘ ‘The ﬁrst thing I liked about the
examination was that the doctor was
a woman,” said Christine.

Another aspect of the examina-
tion she liked, Christine said, was
that when she told the doctor she
wanted a diaphragm, “she ex-
plained how to put it in and then she
put it in. She then told me to check
it, so I would know how it feels when
it is properly placed. The doctor left,
but the nurse stayed with me, and
had me remove it and replace it until
I was sure I was doing it right.”

Lab Theater Presents Slap-stick Brecht

By BETSY NORMAN

Mother Courage
Directed by Bill Royston
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre

Using his own translation of
Bertholt Brecht’s “Mother Cour-
age,” Director Bill Royston took on
the large task of putting Brecht’s
humor back into the script and
distancing the audience from the
action on stage. He tried to put
Brecht’s theories of epic theater on
stage and make them work.

It is too bad he failed. I really
wanted it to work.

Brecht theater requires an
excellent cast, which, with the
exceptions of Jodie McClintock and

David Miller, the cast was not.
Because of Brecht’s episodic script,
the performance must be cohesive.
Royston’s “Mother Courage” is
not, and this lack of ﬂuidity is rooted
in either the direction or the
translation.

“Mother Courage” is about
survival. A nomadic family travels
all over central Europe the Thirty
Years War in the l600’s, selling
their wares to camps of soldiers.

Mother Courage (Kate Royston)
leads her daughter Kattrin (Jodie
McClintock) and her sons Eilif (Tom
Yates) and Swiss Cheese (Vincent
Vok), to tragedy, eventually losing
all three of her children to war.

Royston’s translation is not what I
believe Brecht intended. Brecht

Kate Royston takes the title role in this adaption of Bertholt Brecht’s classic
“Mother Courage.”

ARTS

employed black humor in his work.
Royston turned Brecht’s black
humor into slapstick humor. The
Uncle Sam costume—the hat, the
beard—was a little too‘ much.

Royston explained he was trying
to get each character to concentrate
on an individual idiosyncrasy,
exaggerate it. . He wanted each
character to become a caricature.

Caricatures are ﬁne, but they
don't belong in Brecht. A Japanese
executioner brandishing a samurai
sword is too reminiscent of
“Saturday Night Live.” I
understand Brecht felt theater
ought to be an event, but I can’t help
think he had something else in
mind. The set was another
production problem. Brechtian
theater demands construction on
stage, something large. But
Royston’s covered wagon is too
large for the performing space. The
actors were struggling to work
against the set, not with it.

The one bright spot in the
production was the ﬁne acting of
Jodie McClintock. Taking on one of
the most difficult roles in the show,
Mother Courage’s mute daughter
Kattrin, McClintock proved that her
excellent performance in “Sylvia
Plath: A dramatic Portrait” this
past fall was not a ﬂuke.

The role of Kattrin is a difﬁcult
one simply because she is mute.
Conveying the character of some-
one who doesn’t talk requires
excellent control of your body and
face through total concentration. It
must be hard to concehtrate on
facial expression while ﬁghting a
set that doesn’t work and script that
is not cohesive.

McClintock’s role becomes
doubly difﬁcult as she becomes the
pivotal actor. Kattrin is the only
realistic character among Royston’s
caricatures.

“Within this type of production,
you need to retain one character
who the audience can accept as
being realistic,” Royston said. “In

a sense, Kattrin becomes the
medium between production and
audience.

“Kattrin is not usually thought of
as the pivotal character. Mother
Courage usually is.”

“Mother Courage.”

Royston tried new things in this
production. A student ct theater
should see it because ofthat. But as
entertainment, the performance is
not what most people would expect.
I think most would be disappointed

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
“Double Live Gonzo”
Ted Nugent
Columbia Records
Ted Nugent, the madman

guitarist from Detroit, may be one
of the most interesting characters in
rock ’n’ roll history.

His philosophies and antics lend
credence to this claim.

For one thing, Nugent prides
himself not only on his vicious
ability to pulverize the masses with
high-energy hard rock, but also on
his ability as a stalker of the wild.

Nugent is not a laid-back,
burnt-out, 90-pound rock ’n’
roller—he has stalked, killed and

prepared all the meat h and his
family have eaten during he last 10
years. He also wears the skins of his
kills on stage, like a modern-day
Geronimo with a guitar.

Nugent’s Michigan farm pr”. ;
duces all he needs, and he uses itfss
his sanctuary from the crazy life of
the rock’n’rol1 world. If indeed he
ﬁnds himself out in the wild among
the trees and the animals, when he
gets back to music, he resumes his
image of the rock ’n’ roll beast.

“Double Live Gonzo” is the latest
album from the man who would
probably shoot you in the gut with
hunting arrow if you dare utter the
word “mellow” in his presence.

The album is a glowing tribute to

Globes, Science Fiction Awards Overdone 

By PATTY TASCARELLA

In the beginning, there were the
Oscars, which begat the Tonys,
which begat the Emmys, which
begat the Grammys, which begat
the Golden Globes, which begat a
whole chain of all-encompassing
entertainment awards.

Golden Globe Awards Sunday
night’s otherwise known as the

V Foreign Press Awards, cover almost

every category of entertainment.

They only recently have been
telecast nationally (this year as
NBC’s “Big Event”) and are
generally used to gauge popular
sentiment for the Academy Awards.

Best Dramatic Acress nominees
included Ann Bancroft (“The
Turning Point”) and Diane Keaton
(“Looking for Mr. Goodbar”), but
Jane Fonda took top honors for
“Julia.” Richard Burton was Best
Dramatic Actor for his role in
“Equus.”

“The Turning Point” was voted
best dramatic ﬁlm over such
acclaimed pictures as “Star Wars, ’ ’
‘Close Encounters of the Third
Kind” and “Julia.”

Neil Simon’s “The Goodbye
Girl” swept the comedy ﬁlm
categories, taking awards for best
picture, best actress (Marsha
Mason) and best actor (Richard
Dreyfuss).

A syndicated awards show for
fantasy and science ﬁction ﬁlms was
aired a week before the Golden
Globe Awards. While the Globes
were overblown and tedious, the
science ﬁction awards were ludic-
rous and seemed to have been
created only to further exploit ‘ ‘Star
Wars” and “Close Encounters.”

There have been tarshy award
shows like the “Playmate of the
Year Contest” and foolish award
shows like “The People’s Choice”
(where “Disco Duck” and “Beth”
split the prize for best song). The
science ﬁction awards were need-
less. L

The big problem with the show
was the simple lack of categories
and entries to fill them. Special
effects, direction and similar
categories were easy to ﬁnd. “Star
Wars” swept the awards for
technical excellence. But when it

came to fantasy, the program
looked forced and the fantasy and

science ﬁction categories overlap-
pe .

It is hard enough to say
something ﬂattering about a show
that would award best actor to
George Burns for “Oh, God” and
best actress to Jodie Foster for
“The Little Girl Who Lived down
the Lane.” Burns’ acting was
better than Mark Hamill’s but
that’s not saying much! “Little
Girl” was neither fantasy not
science ﬁction, but a murder
mystery.

But better to credit Burns and
Foster than the other entries in the
fantasy acting category, which
included Joan Collins for her
performance in “Attack of the Giant
Ants.”

Science ﬁction deserves some
recognition, but it could have been
handled tastefully (though the word
is obviously foreign to award shows)
by televising the science _ﬁction
writers’ awards with an added
category for ﬁlms.

George Burns, shown here with John Denver, was voted best fantasy actor in
the fantasy and science fiction film awards. Burns played the title role in “Oh.

God.”

what Nugent’s music always has
been about: viscerally nasty.
excruciatingly loud and, on the
surface, downright treacherous.

Although Nugent’s last three
studio albums have gone platinum
(one million copies sold)- things
haven’t always been so good for
him.

He’s been in the music ﬁeld since
1965 when his first group, The
Lourdes, used to open up at Cobo
Hall for Motown soul acts such as
Dianna Ross and the Supremes.

Although not much is mentioned
today about the Lourdes, they were
just like Nugent today: “typically
wild as dogs” with leather jackets

and peroxide dyed blond hair used
for effect.

Nugent enjoyed minor success
with the single “Journey to the
Center of the Mind,” which was
made with his group, the Amboy
Dukes, inthe late 1960's. After-that,
Nugent seemingly disappeared for
six years before signing with
Columbia and subsequent commer-
cial success.

Nugent didn’t change his act or
musical style, the audience just
caught up with him.

Who makes up this audience?
People who like to listen to perhaps
the hardest rock music ever
recorded by humans. It possesses a
relentless beat, grinding power

All the songs on the album are cut
from this primal mode and are given
such apt titles as “Stormtroopin’,”
“Cat Scratch Fever,” “Strangle-

Although not the stuff that would

the songs are honest statements

Ready or No t-Sto ttlemyer to Wrestle  

ByJIMLEWIS
Pitt'ANews Staff Writer

“I’m healthy now,” Pitt all-
America 134-pound wrestler Rande
Stottlemyer said of a ﬂu infection

-which kept him out for almost two
weeks. “Tonight against Clarion I
will be ready to go.”

This ultimatum, delivered prior
to tonight's 7:30 p.m. encounter
u _ith the Eastern Wrestling League-
leading Golden Eagles at the Field
House, came as a surprise after
Panther head coach Dave Adams
expressed doubt this week as to
Stottlemyer’s condition.

“He’s questionable for the
match,” Adams said. “I’d call his
chances of competing ‘so-so’.”

“I think he’s just leaving the
decision up to me,” Stottlemyer
said. “It depends on how I feel
physically. But I feel healthy again,

Stottlemyer will be needed
against a team tht is 9-5 and upset
5th-ranked Penn State last Satur-
day, 24-15, to claim the EWL lead.

“Ihavealot of respect for them,”
he claimed. “I was recruited by
both Pitt and Clarion. I have a lot of
respect for Clarion—it’s a real good
school, has a. good _ wrestling
program. To be honest, I don’t
know why I chose to come here
instead——I guess it was a lot of little
things that helped me make up my
mind. But I have a lot of respect for
them—I’d like to wrestle against
them.”

Stottlemyer’s opponent, senior
Randy Miller, has been a nemesis
for the Panther lightweight. At the
Penn State Invitational last Dec-
ember, Stottlemyer defeated Miller
by a 4-3 decision.

“It was very close,” Stottlemyer
said. ‘ ‘He really made me look bad,

though, putting me on the
defensive. Iwon, but I sure didn’t
look good.”

Stottlemyer’s performance could
give the mental edge to Miller.

“I’m sure in the back of his mind
he’sthinking, ‘IfI take it to him, I’ll
sin’,” Stottlemyer said. “He has
the mental edge—it’s my job to take
it away from him.”

That will be hard, for the two
wrestlers have the same style.

“We kind of clash a little,”
Stottlemyer admitted. “We both
wrestle on our feet, with a lot of
motion. I’ll just have to get going,
go afterhim, not sit back. I have to
set the tempo—if he sets it, then
forget it.

“That says it all for the team,
too-—if we go out and be aggressive,
we have a good chance. If we sit
back, we’re going to lose.”

Lewis Odyussey Anythng But Sonny

BySAMS I

itt News Stall" Writer

As had been expzcted, junior guard Terry Peavy
transferred to Point Park College Monday. What was
unexpected, however, that Sonny Lewis, the ﬂashy
sophomore from Schenley, also left Pitt for the college
downtown. ‘A

Before this season, Point Park coach Jerry Conboy
thought Peavy, along with Gary Smith, would be
coming to him in the first place. But never in Conboy’s
wildest dreams could he have imagined Lewis
donning the short-sleeved uniform of Point Park.
Which makes now a good time to review the case.

7 between Coach Tim Grgurich and the departed Lewis.

At Schenley High, in his senior year, Lewis was
“main man.” He slam dunked, blocked shots, and,’
free-wheeled while leading the Spartans into the state
playoffs before losing to Farrell. After the game,

.-  Lewis approached Grgurich and asked him to ‘ ‘get the
 papers” because he (Lewis) was ready to sign.

1!

€32

He entered the post-season all-star game circuit,
where his style'of play was made to order. At the
Roundball Classic in Pittsburgh, ‘Lewis gave Pitt fans
and the crowd of 16,000 an eyeful, scoring 20 points
and displaying great leaping ability. He was selected
Pennsylvania’s MVP and received the same honor on
the U.S. team at the Roundball Classic in Cleveland.
Expectations mounted and the fans drooled.

Lewis made the transition to college ball reasonably
well. The loss of players like Tom Richards, Bob
Shresbury and Willie Kelly made his debut easier,
since more openings were available. His 22 points as a

freshman led Pitt to a big 64-56 upset win over
Duquesne at the Arena.

Unfortunately, the 1977-78 season was destined to
be different.

Great things were expected of Lewis. but his
development never materialized. As things turned
out, Pitt was destined to be a team-oriented outﬁt,
which had little room for individuality. Lewis
experienced stiff competition for a starting position.
but was he ready to fight this battle? Lewis’ fans

constantly screamed for Grgurich to use their man at
point guard, which would have been fine, if not for

certain obvious shortcomings. Lewis’ ball-handling,

it turned out, was less than adequate. His passing was

fair and his defense in the Morris Harvey disaster
spoke for itself. He blew hot and cold. He hit eight of
11 shots to lead Pitt to a win against Fordham, but he

was ineffective against Temple.

Merely because he could jump to the ceiling to dunk
and reject shot-s hardly qualiﬁed him as a complete
basketball player. Lewis earlier expressed the

v , , L... ,... ...- .. ,.....  . .,.....,,. ..,.» .,’~_, .. _ . _ . . _  ,.

complaint that, “Coach won’t let me do my thing.”
Sonny refused to realize he was not longer in th
Schenley league, where the style of play can never b
confused with that expected in the collegiate game.

There is also the distinct probability that Lewis

 

 

conduct and attitude were disruptive and that it was 1;

threatening to become contagious early in the season
when the Panthers were taking their lumps.

Is there any doubt that Pitt’s basketball team is now
together and organized and “espirit de corps, ” if you
please? There is a sense of togetherness which
Grgurich can’t afford to jeopardize—with or without
Lewis. It belongs to those who have worked hard to
achieve it.

For example, at the Pitt-St. Francis game in
December, Lewis saw no action in the first half.
Assuming his plight was to be the same in the second
half, Lewis went straight from the locker room to the
bench instead of warming up with his teammates.
He sulked and divorced himself from those who had a
right to depend upon him. Every time he missed a

practice or gave less than 100 percent he detracted _
from the efforts of his teammates and made their task -5

all the more difﬁcult.

The point is this—-Grgurich should not be labeled
the villian in this case. At most, he could be charged at
times with questionable judgement. And it stops
there. Grgurich is maturing fast, thanks to
experiences like Sonny Lewis. Fans have screamed at
Grgurich for suspending Lewis and for some other
disciplinary actions taken during his three years at
Pitt. But Grgurich is one of the few coaches today who
has a genuine and sincere interest in his players as
individuals, even after they've sunk their ﬁnal jump
shot. He believes in his program and the people who
comprise his organization. His loyalty has never been
questioned by those who have rubbed elbows with
him.

So long as he remains in the city of Pittsburgh,
Sonny Lewis will always have his loyal following, and
that's good for Lewis, who needs that type of
attention. But what happens when the applause dies
down? Will Lewis be able to handle it without having
conditioned himself for adversity? Having listened to
the complaints from the student section, it is apparent
that Lewis doesn’t have to prove his skills to anybody.
Which is why his transfer to Point Park is curious. A

momentum that helped in a 21-12

Adams claims ‘ ‘isn’t as good, at this
point, as Clarion.” How will
Stottlemyer do against ateam which
has unbelievable momentum after a
spirit-lifting defeat of the 5th-rank-
ed team in the nation?

“Of course, I'm not as sharply
tuned as I could be because of the
layoff,” Stottlemyer admitted.
“My moves are not down, my
conditioning has suffered. But
there are pluses to such a layoff.
You miss wrestling. When you do
ﬁnally come back, you have a taste
for wanting to do it—you go out with
a little more enthusiasm.”

“They’re pin-constious and

said. “we’re counting on our guys

vers. That way, we have a chance to
win either way—with Stottlemyer
and (190-pounder Bill) Bailey in
there or not.”

But Stottlemyer, for one, will be
in the lineup intent on improving a

“I don’t think I’ve wrestled well
all year,” he said. “I think I've
shown ﬂashes of aggressiveness,
but I haven’t been consistent. I
guess you could say that tonight's
the start of another season for me. ”

Pitt A waits Orange A fter   Blasting Rockets   

By CINDY NATALI

A record-breaking performance
last Saturday against Slippery Rock
bolstered the Pitt gymnasts for their
big upcoming meet with Syracuse.

After Pitt’s 184.9 to 170.35
victory over the Rockets, a very
excited coach Frank D’Amico said,
“At this rate we could take third
place in the Easterns.”

Coach D’Amico looked at the
meet with Slippery Rock as an
indicator of what he could expect
from his Panthers against Syracuse.

“We’re not meeting Slippery
Rock, we’re meeting Syracuse
today as far as I’m concerned,” he
said before the meet.

The gymnasts did more than
surpass D’Amico’s goal of beating

Slippery Rock by at least three
points and setting a new record,
believing the whole team pulled
together for this win.

“One of the nice things about the
meet is that it was a total team
effort. Everyone improved over the
last two weeks and it does show me
that we can beat Syracuse,”
D’Amico said.

D’Amico said that the team effort
succeeded because everyone picked
up tenths of a point, rather than
relying on outstanding performanc-
es from only a handful.

Pitt’s strongest events include
the rings and the high bar. The
Panthers dominated every event
against Slippery Rock, highlighted
by a sweep of the ﬁrst ﬁve places in
the high bar.

Although Pitt was losing after the
ﬁrst two events, the Panthers
overcame the Rockets by nine
points in high bar alone. Pitt also

‘ surpassed their average point totals
on the rings and in vaulting.

Although nearly everyone is hurt
in some way, D’Amico hopes the
Panthers can hold down their
injuries. The most seriously injured
is Jeff Litzinger, who is out of
competition with a knee problem.

Cem Akisoglu has also been
plagued with shoulder and arm
aches, and shoulder problems have
restricted Keith Wipprecht, an
all-round performer, to just working
high bar.

The Syracuse scoring this season
has hovered around 187 to 189
points, and D’Amico expects-a close
meet, believing scores are closer

Pitt Tour A Wee Bit Interesting

By MARY S. HUZINEC

Pitt News Slaffwritcr

The Pantherette basketball team
returned home in the wee hours of
the morning Monday, after com-
pleting an interesting weekend of
basketball as they beat LaSalle
College, 99-81, and lost to West
Chester State, 70-65, running their
record to 9-8.

Coach Jean Balthaser was
ecstatic about the play of the team
on Monday against LaSalle. “The
win was an important one,” she
said. “We were lackadaisical
against West Chester, but we
played with intensity at LaSalle.

“I’m proud of the way they
pl_axe_d Monday,” she continued.
“They were there to play-—they
hustled.”

Balthaser moved Kit Loefﬂer into
the starting lineup in the LaSalle
game, to go along with regulars,

Wanda Randolph, Stephanie Strip-
ling, Robin Fry and Debbie Lewis.

Stripling had a game high of 30
points in the victory, as the junior
forward played her best game of the
season, making 14 of 21 shots and
pulling down eight rebounds.

Lewis, who had fan support from
her nearby hometown, Willow
Grove, Pa., scored 23 points and
had 16 assists.

“Debbie played a good ﬂoor
game,” said Balthaser. “Her shot
selection was good, and she picked
apart their zone defense.”

Balthaser called LaSalle’s 1-3-1
zone defense a “poor choice,”
because Stripling was so hot.

“Stephanie just played a super
game,” she said.

Against West Chester on Satur-
day, Stripling again got into double
figures by scoring 16 points. Lewis
had 19.

Balthaser said the loss may be
attributed to the fact that Randolph
got into foul trouble in the ﬁrst ten
minutes of the game.

West Chester jumped off to a 12
point lead before Randolph left the
game. The 6-3 center sat out much
of the first half, but came back to
help Pitt jump ahead by the half,
39-31.

In the second half, West Chester
scored eight consecutive points to
tie the game. The score seesawed
throughout the remainder of the
half.

The Pantherettes had a shot at a
victory with a minute-and-a-half left
to go. Down by ﬁve, Pitt was
awarded a technical for a scorebook
violation, but missed the free throw
and then failed to score on the
ensuing possession.

Pitt icers Gain Weekend Split

By JIM NELSON

The Pitt hockey club took to the
road again last weekend, losing to
the University _of Virginia, 6-3,
before bouncing back to beat the
Richmond Vikings, 5-4.

In the first game, the Panthers
could do no right. The Cavaliers
jumped out to an early 2-0 lead only
2:21 into the game. Tim Duffy then
scored for the Panthers off 3. Larry
Gallick rebound. Hetz tied the
game a minute later with a
breakaway goal.

The Panthers folded quickly
thereafter. The Cavaliers tallied
the next four goals with Keith Miller
getting the hat trick.

Hetz then scored the ﬁnal goal of
the game, beating Tom I.ooney with
a perfect backhand shot.

The second game was a near
replica of the first. Pitt didn’t
exactly play well but emerged on
the right side of a 5-4 score
nonetheless.

Dave Elson got the first of three
goals with 6:41 gone in the game.
The Vikings tied it three minutes
later on a strong shot from Bob
Doberty before Elson scored his
second on a pass from Larry Gallick.

Richmond tied it again as Ramsey
poked the puck passed goalie Tom
Slivka. Elson completed his hat
trick on a pass from Hetz and Russ
Stump.

The Vikings, who refused to quit,
tied the game for the third time as
Sam Soutward scored on a pass
from Randy Ranjeloruic.

Swanson and

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer

Stuart Swanson and Scott Wink-
ler are two of the reasons for the Pitt
swimming team’s outstanding per-
formances this season.

Swanson, a freshman backstroker
from Sarasota, Fla., was second in
his state in both the 200-yard
backstroke and 500-yard freestyle in
high school. He was also fourth in
the backstroke at the AAU nationals
at Mission Viejo, Calif. last year.

- Swanson, a high school all-ameri-

can is currently ranked 14th in the
world in the backstroke.

Because of his performances,
Swanson was chosen to represent
the United States in an international
competition held in East Berlin last
month and he placed ﬁfth in the
backstroke. Last year, Swanson
was part of a U.S. team competing

in Canada that was, coached .by_._

Pitt’s eoach Dick Bradshaw,
inﬂuencing his decision to come to
Pitt.

Since making that decision, he
has done a ﬁne job for Pitt, cutting
the previous record for 200-yard
backstroke by three seconds in the
ﬁrst meet.

Winkler is a sophomore diver,
who started as a swimmer for North
Hills High School (he held the
school record for the 50-yard
freestyle). He met diving coach Al
Coffey, near the end of his
sophomore year of high school and
became interested in diving. Last
year, he placed fourth in the
one-meter diving and ﬁfth in
three-meter diving at the Easterns,
also competing in the NCAA
championships.

for NCAA competition in both
events. His two ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes

Pitt’s next goal resulted from an

the puck to Bob Stein, who got off a

made its way to the net, Russ Marks
got his stick on it to tip it past the
goaltender.

when teams are on the same level.
“Their gymnastics team is as good
as ours, if not a little better,” he
said, forcasting a Syracuse score of
about 185 when the team visits next
week.

The Panther coach expects Allan
Meyers to perform well in the
all-around, in which he has gained
national status.

“He has a chance for one of the
top three spots in the East,” claims
D’ Amico. This would make Meyers
the ﬁrst Pitt gymnast to qualify for
the national competition.

Gymnast .Mitch Spero said,
“Being the best men’s team that
Pitt has had, we’re going into the
meet with a winning, but not
overconﬁdent attitude. It could be a
very close meet.”

Richmond came back once more 
to tie the game at 12:55 on a goal by

Panther Strikers Bowl Over Bearcats

In the most impressive perfor-
mance since the reorganization of
the Pitt bowling team ﬁve years
ago, the’ Panthers blanked the
defending Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Bowling Conference
(WPIBC) champion St. Vincent
Bearcats by the scores of 854-820,
906-897 and 881-876, ending the
season series with a 12-2 advantage
over the Bearcats.

Led by sophomore Mitch Haber,
who threw for a Pitt record 621

margin of victory was the closest
thing to a blowout all day. The next
two contests were each decided by
less than one mark.

The second game went down to
the last frame. The 906-897 victory
was one of the ﬁner performance by
the Panthers. Pitt was again led by
Haber who rolled a 233, with six
strikes in a row.

On or Off -- Cam

By Mary S. Huzinec

Pitt freshman Anne Jenkins
opened the door of her Tower B room
for the first time. She glanced around
and frowned: it was not what she had
expected.

The room was small: she couldn't
imagine sharing it with another person.
Two bare pull-out beds sat on each side
of her, and there was barely any walking
space between them. Desks with
scorched formica tops faced the wall.

“They've got to be kidding,” she
said. “This must be someone’s closet.”

Anne bought throw rugs, lamps and
prints for theroom. When she and her
roommate, Cindy, hung a “Home.
Sweet Home” poster they laughed for
20 minutes, then wondered about the
potential of the Tower’s
design—-particularly for people in need
of some restraint—|ike criminals, insane
people, architects and housing officials.

Anne and Cindy had liked each other
at first. But Cindy chain smoked, never
made her bed, and decorated the floor
with orange peels and cigarette butts.
The day Anne found moldy yogurt under
her bed, she decided it might be time for
apartment hunting.

Anne was lucky. Two friends with a
vacancy in their Shadyside apartment
invited her to move in. Anne loved the
space. There was a large living room
with two chairs, a couch and some
scattered end tables. The kitchen had
room enough for her toaster and
blender at the same time, a luxury she
hadn’t known in the Towers.

But the apartment took more of her
time than the dorm room. There were
more things to be cleaned, more items,
like mops and dishwashing liquid, to
buy. And cooking for herself me-ant
standing in long lines at the Giant Eagle
with people who talked to themselves,
or dropping eggs and milk all over
Walnut street on the way home from
shopping.

Taking a bus to school meant getting»

up earlier to get to class on time, or
walking, if the buses were running late.

Dorm life had cramped Anne, but
apartment living was wearing her out.
She found out early in her college
career how difficult living on or off
campus could be.

Obviously, there are advantages to
both.

According to Donovan Hughes, Pitt’s_

director of housing, an increasing
number of upperclassmen are retaining
dormitory rooms each year. He cited
four main reasons:

Convenience——“Because the
dorms are right on campus, you can fall
out of bed and into classes,” Hughes
said.

Security—Desk moderators and
door locks are used in every dorm.

Lack of available off—campus
housing-—finding a nice reasonably
priced apartment near campus is not an
easy task.

Wednesday. February 1, 1978—5TH AVENUE—Paqe 3

pus , That Is

Custodial work is taken care of for
the students———bathrooms are cleaned
daily, and free linen services are
provided.
Living in an apartment, however, has
several advantages over dorm living:
Privacy—ln most cases you can
go into the bedroom, living room or
kitchen if you want to get away from
people. ln a dorm there is often no
escape from others. V
Food—You can cook food
according to your own preference in an
apartment, and you can make as much
or as little as you want.
Often‘ it's hard to decide which dorms
or which apartment you want after
you've opted for on- or off—campus

housing. On campus you have single.
double, triple and quad rooms in Towers
A. B and C. and Holland. Brackenridge,
McCormick. Amos and Lothrop Halls to

choose from.

Off campus your choices include a
variety of furnished and unfurnished
apartments, houses and efficiencies.

Hughes explained that out of
approximately 3,600 dormitory
accommodations, 1.100 of them are
single rooms. These residents pay the
steepest on-campus housing
rate———$550 per term. Two dorms are
strictly single accommodations——Tower
C and Lothrop. There are also singles
scattered in Holland, Brackenridge,
Amos and McCormick Halls.

Towers A and 8 house only double
rooms for $495 per term. Holland Hall,
an all-female dorm, has mainly doubles
and some triples for $390. and quads
for $345.

Brackenridge, McCormick and Amos
Halls offer suites, a dormitory living
accommodation much like an apartment.
Four to nine people can live in a suite,
depending on the number of rooms in
the particular suite. All these rooms are
set up to house two students, each of
whom pay the double room rate.

Meal tickets, which can be
purchased by on-
students are $330 for 19 meals per
week, $310 for 14 meals, $260 for 10
meals and $1 76 for five.

Food prices are lower for off-campus
students. Mary Lou Sosso, Pitt’s
coordinator of off-campus housing, said
recently the average food cost for two
apartment residents is $75 per person
per month. Utilities average $35 per
month.

Prices for unfurnished two-bedroom‘
apartments range from $200.
Furnished three-bedroom apartments
rent starting at $260 in Oakland and
$285 in Squirrel Hill.

A variety of apartments are available
throughout the Pitt community. The
hardest thing is to find one that has the
conveniences you want.

Or maybe, as Anne ‘ found, the
hardest thing is to adjust to the
inconveniences of both dorms and
apartments.

Rented Memories: A Tenant’s Tale 

By Matthew D. Kambic

When it came time to make the big
move down to an apartment near
campus, my» most immediate concern

was money. Would I be willing to give»

up the inexhaustible supply of food
available at home and the unlimited and
indiscriminate use of the phone? Would

., I be able to exist without things like new

records and pinball? After all, most of
the meager finances currently allocated
for my personal needs would soon be
channeled into rent, gas, electric and
phone bills.‘ I decided that, with a little
self-discipline I could get by without
eating or using thephone, and broke
into my piggy bank for the rest of the
money l would need.

Signing the lease was almost as
traumatic as trying to read it. Who knew
what rights we were waiving as we
penned in our names on the bottom
At this point, no one really

Matthew D. Kambic, a former
Atwood “complex” resident has
returned to the relative simplicity of
life in his narenls home.

We had some good times and bad
times, but most of the time we spent
there was just “filler,” that is—tnere
were better places to be if you wanted
adequate lighting, warmth or a bathroom
with more than one towel for six people.

But it was home. There you could

‘play your 40 watt per channel stereo at

full volume without waiting for mom to
“lower the boom,” so to speak. There
you could wander in at 4:30 a.m., no
questions asked, and play your stereo
at half-volume. There you could let your
clothes become landmarks all about
your room, and hang strangeand unique
posters of your own choosing on the
walls.

I had five apartment-mates during my
tenure as a tenant, each partially sane,
and each occasionally willing to take the
garbage out. We were all students at
Pitt; three engineers and three
“liberals. We moved in one week prior
to the start of school to cleanup the
decaying ice cream bars the previous
tenants had left throughout our new
domain (they had all been Goodie-Bar
truck drivers...) Our apartment
consisted of the upper two floors of a
house, three twin_bedrooms and one
smaller bedroom that was often

When the Roof Falls In

Two years ago, a well-known Oakland landlord connected the lights of his
apartment building to. the electric meter of one of his tenants. After receiving
several high electric bills, the tenant became suspicious and contacted

Duquesne Light.

The company notified the tenant of the landlord’s ploy. After consultation with
the owner, the tenant had money deducted from future rent payments.

While incidents like this may sound rare, they do happen, according to Bruce
Stephen, chairman of the Legal Awareness Committee. '

“People often don’t know what to do in a situation like that,” Stephen said.
“The best and safest thing to do is to get legal counsel to find out their rights.”

Stephen explained that Legal Awareness can advise Pitt students on legal
matters, and, if necessary, refer them to proper authorities, such as the Bureau
of Consumer Protection and the Better Business Bureau.
has a law firm on retainer, should it be needed.

Stephen said tenants should carefully read over their apartment lease before
they sign it. He suggested therenter search the apartment when he moves in.
Damages, such as holes in the wall, broken furniture and stains on carpets should
be noted, and witnessed by a person other than a relative or close friend.

“That way, when the tenants move out they can prove the damages were
present before they moved in,” Stephen said. “Sometimes landlords try to tag
on extra charges that renters are in no way responsible to pay. _

if a carpet was old when they moved in, they shouldn’t be held responsible to

shampoo it or buy a new one.”

Often tenants have bad experiences with poor heating and leaking roofs,
putting them in bad positions because they "are unable to move out.
situation, Stephen suggests victims call the Health Department, which will send
an investigator to check out the complaint.

“The most important thing for tenants to remember is thatjthey are only
responsible for leaving the apartment as they found it,” he added.

mistaken for a closet. The living room
could not have been mistaken for a
living room, however. it was a
lamentable assortment of broken couch
legs and wafer-thin rugs that looked like
rejects from miniature golf putting
greens. The kitchen and the bathroom
were separated by a thin crumbling wall
of plaster. It took one week of cleaning
to realize we would never get this place
really clean. So we settled back and
enjoyed ourselves without being overly

fussy. If miners could work in these
conditions, we could live in these
conditions.

Our back steps descended into our
back yard, which was descended from a
line of back yards known mostly for their
sparse growth, lack of largeness and
ability to attract stray trash. All in all, we
couldn’t ask for more, because we
certainly wouldn’t get it at the price we
were paying.

The first months went by smoothly;
we were robbed twice, the furnace pilot
light kept going out at night (who knows
where?), we missed two rent—due
deadlines and paid the penalties, and
had five parties over a stretch of four
days. The toilet overflowed once,
someone actually dried
instead of letting them “drip-dry” in the
sink, the apartment across the street
burned not quite down and we had

tabsolutely no cockroaches (only a

curious, but seemingly friendly gang of
small brown bugs that roamed happily
among the floorboards of our kitchen).

There were times when the
refrigerator held little food (all the time),
and there were times when some of us
wished we were elsewhere (whenever
we set foot in the crummy place).
Otherwise, we were content. We had
only to look out the front windows to
forget about our woes. This view of
Atwood Street, busy" with the day-to-
day commerce of students, derelicts,
drunkards and even people, was like
observing the rain gutter of life—souls
floating by heading for the drain.
Actually, all we could see out the
window was our rain gutter,_ and this is
why most of us ended up daydreaming
about what the front street really looked
like.

Thinking back and remembering our
days in the apartment, we had no
regrets. In fact, when it came to moving
out, we found we were nostalgic. We
had somehow matured: After living
there, we had come to realize anything
might be better. But it would never be
the same. And the experience made us
richer human beings- especially after we
got o_ur security deposit back.

By Mark Murphy

When I first moved into the
dormitories that September day in
1976, I figured I was in for four years of
hell. I anticipated cramped quarters,
bad food and a real loser for a
roommate.

Boy, was I wrong. Through the
windows of the Towers, I could lean out
and absorb all the beauty and culture of
Oakland. I will admit it did take me some

-7 ‘time, about a full year, to see what I had

been missing. What convinced me was
a letter from the Office of Residence
L.ife telling me the results of a poll they
took of the inmates on death row at San
Quentin prison. They asked the inmates
to describe the place that most seemed
like home, and nearly all, 93.7 percent,
described quarters uncannily
resembling the Towers.

I said“ to myself, “People like that
must know a lot about living. I thought
for a moment, and considered the
alternatives to dormitory life.”

Commuters must battle traffic,
weather and the PAT bus system just to

évaget to school in time to hear it has been
l'canceHed.

An apartment dweller must deal with
monthly rent payments, grizzled
landlords and heating bills that rise in
proportion to the falling temperature.

The first plus I discovered about
dorm life was acquiring a roommate.
Some students prefer to pick their
roommates in advance, which is not
nearly as much fun as sharing your most
intimate bodily aberrations with a total
stranger. What is more, your roommate
is always a great guy. Never will he be
so inconsiderate as to make drugdeals

using the room phone. Never will the

lhzgarsenal of weapons he keeps in the

bolster go off accidentally when he
lights a match nearby, And never, but
never, will he entertain his girlfriend in
your room while you lie in feigned
peaceful slumber just three feet away.
Instead, most roommates play a
great deal of pinochle, (when not
studying, of course), and take turns at
leading group prayer.
The space the University allots to
» each student is more than adequate. I
will admit that I had to move my__annua|
square dance out of my room and into
the hall, but after the first month, I rarely
knocked out my roommate’s teeth
awhile stretching my arms to yawn.

9% ,J'
lg.’ ere was plenty of drawer space for

my three shirts and pair of jeans. and
the shelf space was more than sufficient
for any four thin books I chose to bring.

The bathroom is perhaps the most
fun place in the dorms. Always clean
and ready for use (after stepping over
the pile of yuk in the doorway), the
bathrooms feature steaming hot water.
If you are small enough to crawl into a
sink, you may get to use some of that
water, but for most people, a lukewarm
(more luke than warm) shower willhave
to do.

Be warned, however, that the maid
spends a good 45 minutes cleaning up
the bathroom every Monday through
Friday. The time varies from floor to
floor, so check your local listings. The
maid on my floor denies that she waits
outside my door until she hears me
awaken, so that she can sprint to shut
off the bathroom for her daily cleaning
just when I am ready to go in. That may
be true, but all I know is I have yet to
take a shower within an hour of getting
up. 9

I never have seen any insects in the

When Is aDorm
More Than a Dorm?

By Patty Tascarella

The units in use now——health-related professions floors, reduced visitation

areas, engineering floors, coed floors and the intensive study units are all
designed with the students’ interests in mind. I

‘‘I moved to the intensive study floor in Tower C because I thought it would be
quieter than my double in Tower A,” said Tom Ricci, a junior life sciences major.

Intensive study units take up six floors of Tower C and have the regular “quiet
hours” (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. Monday through Friday tripled to 24 hours a day, five
days a week). They are probably the most successful of the spacial units and ,
Since there is an overabundance of females
wishing to get into Tower C’s single rooms, however, people often bid for the unit V
not for its special advantages but for the privacy.

‘,‘I like it here because It’s quiet,” Ricci said. ‘‘I don’t have to run to the library
every night like I did before. It’s hard to study when you have a roommate.”

Ricci found the more cloistered atmosphere improved his concentration since
he is now able to visit a neighbor when he wants, rather than because a
roommate wants to talk or blast his stereo. ’

“People visit back and forth a lot here,” Ricci said.
because I don’t like to stay by myself. Only now, you have to make an effort to
know people, rather than meeting them through your roommate.”

Ricci's roommate last year, Vince
Hopkins, remains on their old floor in
Tower A, which is now a part of the
engineering unit. A sophomore
majoring in civil engineering, Hopkins is
planning to bid for a suite come room-
drawing time in March. . ‘

“There’s I not much difference

between the floor last year and now,"
he said. “Many engineers had lived on
the floor before, which was one of the
reasons it was singled out for the new
project.
“lt's quiet here because everyone
has to study so much," Hopkins
continued, “but I don’t want to live here
again. I'd rather live in a suite because
it's more like an apartment, and we can
have a lot more people around."

According to Tim Snyder, assistant
to the director of the office of resident
life, and a prime innovator of the lifestyle
units, the new projects were developed
because the students expressed
interest in them.‘ While engineering and
health-professions units are exclusive,
to those majors, Snyder said if certain
students in other programs were
interested in living in the unit, special

,. . onsiderations could be made.

“Most students don’t know that if
enough of them want a special lifestyle

want. in most cases," Snyder said.

“This way, they know exactly what's
expected of them," Snydersaid. “lf
there are special qualifications or rules,
they know about it beforehand. They
get a chance to visit the units and talk to
people living there. And we take their
names down do they -are given top
priority during room drawings."

The most notorious of the special
units is the coed floors—ma|e and
female rooms are alternated on two
floors of Tower B. When freshmen are
assigned to these rooms, they are told
in advance so other arrangements can
be made if they object. But in place of
the orgiastio- conditions that many
parents fear, the coed floors have
developed into a sort of family situation,
according to many residents.

‘‘I think it's a lot better than what I
expected," said a sophomore female
who has lived on the coed floor two
years. ‘‘I didn't know what to expect at
first. I know it sounds corny, but it's like
a family. I really. like it a lot and I don’t
have to worry like I would on an all-girl
floor. It's a lot safer because there's
always a man around."

Domitories can be unconventional,
but it takes a special combination of
ideas and people to make it work.
