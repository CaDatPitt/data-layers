Reported rape increase
due to public awareness

By John Enright
Editor-in-Chief

In the past two months,
there have been a high num-
ber of reported rapes in Pitts-
burgh — especial_ly the
Oakland-Squirrel Hill area.
But Education Specialist Jen-
nifer Wood of Pittsburgh Ac-
tion Against Rape said she
believes the number of rape

' cases hasn't been on the
uprise. ' A

”We're busy year round.
We get a lot of calls in the
midd|e‘of the winter and the
middle of the summer. What
we are experiencing now, es-
pecially with the media atten-
tion, is that reported rapes at
the moment are increasing.
That's very different from what
is actually going on,.” Wood
said.

Wood said that over 1,200
people reported rapes to‘
PAAR in 1986. The United
States Justice Department esti-
mates that only one out of 10
rapes is reported. If that figure
is accurate then approximate-
ly 12,000 rapes occurred in
Allegheny County last year.

Public awareness is the rea-
son rape is perceived to be on

the rise according to Wood,

”My sense is that when rapes
are reported the media hears
about them, we hear about
them" and then, we as a com-
munity, become more aware
of them. So it seems like rape
is on the increase because our
attention gets turned toward
the subject. Statistically, from
people reporting rape, it's on
the rise, but it's not happening
anymore than in thepast,” she
said.

”We average three or four
calls a day on our hotline. For
PAAR, rape is something that
is 24 hours a day and 365 days

ayear rather than something_

that is seasonal,” Wood
added. .

With four universities in the
Oakland area (Carlow Col-
lege, Chatham College, CMU
and Pitt) the number of young
students living in the area is
very high.‘ Wood didn't dis-
miss the notion that Oakland
is a high frequency area for
rape incidents.

”We get a lot of calls about .

date rape. Usually people call

anonymously, and many of
the calls are from people that

"are in high school or college.

”My sense -is that because
Oakland has several large
universities, this is an area that

is prone or has a high inci-

dence of date rape. So we get
a lot of calls about date rape
that areusually not reported to
the police,” she said.

Wood said she thinks date
rape has started to gain accep-
tance as no less serious a
crime than being raped by a
stranger. In fact, she noted that
85 to 90 percent of the calls
PAAR receives arefrom vic-
tims who have been sexually
asaulted by someone they
knew.

”The most striking thing is
that most of the people who
were calling were raped by
someone they knew. In terms
of attention, date rape has just
received some. It actually has
a name‘ now,” said Wood; .

PAAR, which has been in
operation for 15 years, focuses

on three aspects of rape — cri- '

sis work, counseling and edu-
cation. The organization

One of the key figures in
Richard Nixon's cabinet, former
Secretary of State Henry Kis-

singer, came to Pittsburgh Mon-. A

day to speak at a special

.fund—raiser dinner for the re-

election of U.S. Senator John
Heinz.

Kissinger fielded a multitude of
questions concerning the Iran-
Contra affair. He and Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver _

By Teresa Candori
Managing Editor ' ‘

To get from class to class, a stu-
dent in a wheelchair needs to
know, among other things, the lo-
cation of ramps, the slope of hills

_along the way, the width of

doors, the availability of elevators
and the ‘width of hallways.

If the maps that offer this infor-.
mation are outdated and incor-
rect, getting from class to class
can be an ordeal.

A brochure titled ACCESS, dis-
tributed by Pitt's Disabled Stu-
dent Services office was

published 10 years ago. In those '

10 years, Pittfs -125-acre campus
has undergone major changes,
aquired new buildings and ren-
novated existing buildings, thus
rendering the access guide ob-
solete. , J _

In an effort to update the access
guide, the Student Relations
Committee of the Student
Government and Disabled Stu-
dent Services are currently con-
ducting a survey of the campus
and its buildings.

”We’re doing surveys of hall-
ways, elevators looking for emer-
gency phones, campus phones
and payphones and seeing which

' _. buildings are accessible,” said

 

Craig Jackson, chairman of the

SRC. ' I ‘
Included in the survey are the

location of braille signs and ele-

vator panels to ‘assist blind and _i 

visually impaired students._

In addition to publishing an‘up-
dated brochure, the committee"
hopes to distribute a road‘ map
that would show locations of
ramps, emergency phones and
wheelchair-accessible entrances.

”The maps are so outdated stu-
dents have no idea howto ge
around,” Jackson said.‘ , 

While several university build- ’

ings can be entered by wheel-' ‘

chairs only through adjoining
buildings, only the Mineral Indus-.
tries Building, the Music Building

and the Gardner Steel Confer-_ In

ence Center are inaccessible.

Steps leading to Clapp Hall and 1 O

to Langley Hall, which is acces-

sible only through Clapp, are.;cur_-_.i.
rently being rennovated, but the 4  
installation of ramps is‘ not]; I

planned.

The reason, according to Van
Conklin, associate director of
Physical Plant, is that the ramps
would not be cost effective and,_
in the case of Clapp Hall, would

detract from the architectural

structure.

Open court questioning not wanted by jurors

WASHINGTON — A federal
judge modified jury selection
procedures Tuesday at the perju-
ry trial of former presidential aide
Michael K. Deaver to permit pub-
lic questioning of some prospec-
tive jurors.

But only five of 31 prospective
jurors agreed to be questioned in
open court.

U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson and lawyers in
the case went behind closed
doors to question prospective
jurors who had requested
privacy.

Deaver, a former top aide to
President Reagan, is charged with
lying to a congressional commit-
tee and a grand jury that inves-
tigated his lobbying business for
possible ethics law violations.

Jackson made the announce-
ment at the start of a brief hear-
ing convened to hear protests by
news oganizations against the
secret questioning of prospective
jurors that began Monday.

Threat of directors’
strike over for now

HOLLYWOOD — Negotiators
for film and most television direc-
tors reached a tentative settle-
ment with producers early today
and called off a strike that threa-
tened to cripple the film and tel-
evision industry.

”We have reached a settlement
that will avert the first strike in the
guild's 51-year history,” Chuck
Warn, spokesman for the Direc-
tors Guild of America, an-
nounced as pickets were to go up
at two studios.

Earlier, the guild also reached

an agreement with NBC. Talks .

between the guild and ABC and
CBS continued in New York.
Those talks affect about 600
directors who are salaried em-
ployees of the networks, unlike
the majority of the guild mem-
bers, who are free-lance directors
and are covered by the agree-
ment reached in Los Angeles.
Under the three-year settlement

ed taxes to consumers in Pennsyl-

Tuesday.

Casey, in a letter to Pennsylva-
nia's congressional delegation,
urged support of federal legisla-
tion that would allow states to de-
termine how the utilities must
return the money.

Under language in the Tax Re-
form Act of 1986, Casey said
refunding the overcollections can

- be deferred for years, and states

are prevented from ordering
quicker refunds. The proposal
supported by Casey would repeal
that language.

Casey said the $800 million is
a conservative estimate. The
amount could hit $1 billion.

He said an average family in
Philadelphia would receive a re-
fund of about $100 and a Pitts-
burgh customer would get about
$85. Businesses would also
receive refunds under the
proposal.

Michael Dukakis‘(left) meets with supporters Thursday.

Jon Wells/The Pitt News

Dukakis on campaign trail

By Jon’ Wells

For The Pitt News

Presidential hopeful
Michael Dukakis made a cam-
paign stop in Pittsburgh Thurs-
day night.‘ Dukakis, governor
of Massachusetts, is bidding
for a spot in the 1988 race.

He suggested that the Iran-
scam incident is not solely the
reponsibility of those who
have been under fire at the
select committee trials.

”The problem goes far be-

yond Col. North. When any
person  from the president
on down  begins to think
that they're above the law, this
country is in real trouble. We
are a constitutional democra-
cy. A president can not do
what he wants to do.”
Concerning other national
affairs, he said it may be neces-
sary at times to impose some
barriers to trade. ”Especially
when those barriers are limit-
ed in time and require the
beneficiary to invest and

modernize and become com-
lpetitive.”

He was first elected gover-
nor of Massachusetts in 1974.
In 1978, Dukakis was defeat-
ed in the Democratic guber-
natorial primary by Edward J.
King. In 1982, Dukakis was re-
elected governor of Mas-
sachusetts;

Dukakis, 54, earned a Har-
vard law degree in 1960. He
is married and has three
children.

Lt. Col. North passionate

but untrue,

according

to McFarlane rebuttal

-By Harry F. Rosenthal

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Lt. Col.

Oliver North concluded six ex-.

traordinary days in the congres-

— sional hot seat Tuesday and was

followed by his former boss,
Robert McFarlane, who called
North's testimony ”passionate in
delivery” but in major areas
untrue.

North was dismissed with a
declaration by ‘the chairman of
the House lran—Contra committee
that his activities were part of a
policy ”driven by a series of lies”
that catapulted President Reagan
into his most serious crisis.

”You said these hearings
caused serious damage to our na-
tional interest,” said Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-Ind.) ”But I wonder
whether the damage was caused
by these hearings or acts which
caused these hearings.”

McFarlane, who testified
without the cloak of immunity
that covered North, offered these
rebuttals: ,

°On North's statementthat he
kept McFarlane advised of his ac-
tivities: ”Colonel North did ‘ad-
vise me from time to time on a
few, but certainly not all.’-’

°On North's belief that the
Boland amendment, which for a

time restricted direct U.S. aid to '

the Nicaraguan Contras, did not

apply to the National Security
Council staff, McFarlane said he
argued with Congress about the
matter for weeks and ”at the end
of it we lost.  I think the evi-
dence is that surely I believed that
the Boland amendment applied.

. Otherwise, why would we
have worked so hard to get rid of
it after it passed?”

°On North's contention that he -I

was’ involved in a ”full-service”
covert-action operation, with the
blessing of the late CIA Director

William Casey, McFarlane said,’

’’I never heard of any such full-

service operation from either -
Director Casey or Colonel North, *
and I certainly never concurred in I

one.” . .
McFarlane said that in October

1985, North sent him some

memoranda that ”raised doubts
about his compliance with the
laws. I instructed him, in Colonel
North's words, to fix it," mean-
ing he wanted compliance with
the law.

°For more, see perspective

McFarlane said it was true that I

”narrow and changing restric-
tions” of the Boland amendment
caused changes in conduct of

covert operations ”but this is a far ‘

cry from saying I and other mem-
bers of the administration autho-
rized what was clearly beyond
anyone’s power to authorize.”

It takes more than a degree...

One of the topics of discussion
at the hearings has been the ques-
tion of covert operations being
privy to all members of Congress.
I ”lt’s the essence of covert oper-
ations that they be secret. You
can argue on the topic of who
needs to know [about the opera-
tion],” Kissinger said.

Kissinger said U.S. standing
among its allies has been
damaged, but it is something that
can eventually be recouped.

Kissinger said he was not as
surprised at the diversion of arms
sales profits to the Contras as the
sale of weapons to the Iranians.

He characterized the arms sales
as ”judgment errors produced by
decent motives.” The former
secretary of state remains op-
posed to any negotiations with
terrorists.

”Fundamental|y, each adminis-
tration has to be organized in a
way that makes the president

_comfortabIe,” he said.

Covert operations, according to
Kissinger, should not be run out
of the White House, because the
chance for error is too great.

On the subject of the Persian

Gulf, Kissinger emphasized the

importance of stability in the
region.

”We have a vital interest in the
security of the moderate Arab
states,” he said.

If any naval blockade of Iran is
considered, according to Kis-
singer, the aid of European allies
would be a necessity.

Kissinger said it would be a
mistake to take sides in the Iran-
Iraq war, but that ”a serious ef-
fort through the United Nations
is being made to bring an end to
the war.

”We should not stake our pres-
tige on unattainable goals and ob-
jectives,” said Kissinger,
explaining the limited role of the
United States in the war.

He also explained that the role

of Syria in Lebanon is to see that I

Lebanon‘ does not, for Syrian
security purposes, become in-
dependent. The lack of a stable
government aids the Syrian ob-
jective. In areas where the mili-
tary is in control, Damascus
employs its influence to maintain
some semblance of stability.

”The American ability to solve
these problems is diffucu|t,” Kis-
singer said.

PAAR

Continued from page 1

currently has a staff of 18 people,/__;

and Wood said its basic goal is
to provide needed services.

Wood estimated that last year '

PAAR spoke with over 25,000

people throughout Allegheny

County about rape education.
In terms of counseling, Wood

‘said PAAR’s main goal is to em-

power people and to make them
feel that they've got control back
over their lives.

11"‘

With the recent rape incidents
occurring in the immediate Oak-
land area, Wood is unsure about
what advice is best to give to peo-
ple. She said she knows that no
matter how many precautions a
person takes, being sexually as-
saulted "is still a possibility.

But she does recommend some
self-defense workshops. All one
has to do is call PAAR at

682-0219 and ask about the”,

workshops. ”If people are in-
terested in getting some specific
tips about [rape] prevention I
would recommend that they call
and-go through the self-defense
[program] or talk with someone
here,” said Wood.

(PAAR’s rape hotline number is
765-2737.)

First phase of renovation at 0

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, July l5, I987

Salk dental school underway

By Eric Poole
Staff Writer

With the release of $23.4 mil-
lion by the state legislature, the
University of Pittsburgh has be-
gun a 29-month renovation and

construction of the dental school _

at Salk Hall.

The construction will include a
44,000—square-foot addition, the
bulk of which will comprise the
Edward J. Forrest Center for Con-
tinuing Education, named for the
dean of the dental school from
1963 to 1983.

”This [the Forrest Center] is one
of the big concerns, especially for
the alumni,” said Dr. Arthur
George, the assistant dean of
Pitt's dental school.

Construction began on Mon-
day with the west and front addi-
tions. As a result, the parking
spaces on Terrace Street in front

-‘ of Salk Hall will be blocked off

until January 1988.
”The construction will be in six

phases, with phases one and four .

starting Monday.” said George.
In addition to the new con-
struction, 253,000 square feet of
labs on every floor will be
renovated.
The improvements will not be
strictly aesthetic. Outmoded tools

will be replaced with state-of-the-‘

art equipment, said spokesman
Frank Raczkiewicz.
The first phase, which began

Monday, involves the renovation
of the labs on floors nine through
13. This phase will take the lon-
gest. It will not be completed un-
til March of 1989.

The space between the west
side of Salk Hall and the Salk Hall
Annex is going to be closed as
part of the first phase.

Phases five and six will involve

the construction of the Forrest -

Center, which will include a 52-
seat auditorium, laboratories and
six operatories. These are sched-
uled from March of 1988 until

September of 1989.

One of the results of -the con-
struction is that the parking lot at
the rear of Salk Hall will be elimi-
nated. The Salk Hall construction
will enlarge the building 10 feet
into the parking lot. The re-

mainder of the space will be oc— .

cupied-by the new Medical

Animal Facility. Construction on ,

this building will begin later this

The Salk Hall renovation is
scheduled to be completed in
October 1989.

KARACHI, Pakistan — Four ex-

Tuesday night, and doctors said
at least 49 people were killed and
300 were injured.

The blasts occurred at two bus
stands, a restaurant and an old
building within 200 yards of each
other. Witnesses reported as
many as four buildings ablaze, in-
cluding the restaurant, and said
vehicles and vending carts were

shattered.

”The situation is very bad,"
said Dr. Abdul Karim, head phy-

declared a state of emergency in
the hospitals, and we don't know
what the death toll will be.”

He said his hospital had

MOSCOW — The Ukrainian

The latest moves, announced

LULEA, Sweden — Sailors
threw hand grenades at what ap-
peared to be an alien submarine
in a sensitive military area, the
national defense staff said
Tuesday.

It was the second navy action
this month reported against a sus-
pected intruder in'Tore Bay, a res-
tricted area 38 miles from the
Finnish border _at the northern
end of the Baltic Sea.

Sailors in a small boat saw the
underwater object Monday night
and threw hand grenades at‘it,
staff spokesman Karin Hansson
said in Stockholm.

Patrol boats and helicopters
were called in, but there were no
further sightings and no indica-
tion the intruder was damaged,
the Swedish news agency said.

On July 1, the navy fired depth
charges at a submarine in Tore
Bay and searched several days in

William Pitt Union gets Miami Vice makeover

Summer has only just begun, but it's al-
ready time for this season's list of things
we'll all remember .— but probably all
wish we'd forget.

0 Don't throw Rice at my wedding —
This year's presidential campaign has no
Hart — thanks to the controversy sur-
rounding a boat called Monkey Business
and a few photos of Gary Hart with ac-
tress Donna Rice. In other related news,
there was Jessica Hahn, Tammy Faye Bak-
ker, Fawn Hall and Vanna White. And
speaking of Vanna White 

0 The day Phil Musick ('s column) died
— or so to speak. Vanna Speaks, the au-
tobiography of perfect-to—the-letter Wheel
of Fortune hostess Vanna White, is des-
tined to be one of the most memorable
books of all time — not for its content, but
because ofcritics’ biting remarks about
the toothy celebrity. Phil Musick was just

, a man caught in the shuffle.

0 Pitt goes Miami Vice — You all
thought that tacky neon sculpture in the
William Pitt Union was just some stupid

‘mistake the Student Government Board
made. I dunno. Think about it  it's prob—.

ably all part of a master plan to turn the
WPU into the Miami Hilton. A couple of
weeks later, they plant all these tropical-
looking flora and those mini-palm trees
everywhere. Then they get this real cos-
mopolitan directory sign. When they
officiate a new white linen uniform for the
maintenance crew, I think we should real-
ly start to worry.

0 Arena football -— The advent ofvthis
new—fangled version of an old game is a
sports perk this town certainly needs.
There's already the possibility that the
Arena Football League Championship
Game, or ”Arena Bowl,” could be played
in Pittsburgh this year. Currently, the Pitts-
burgh Gladiators can claim the best
record of any arena team.

STOPPING
TIME
FRANCES SANSIG

0 Getting bullied — Pit bull owners
decried the bad rap their cute, little muffin
pups received, while children were be-
ing mangled. Just recently, a pit bull at-
tacked two Doberman pinschers.

0 Today in Pittsburgh — Bryant Gum-
bel and Jane Pauley broadcast live from

the No. 1 city in the nation. Pitt President .

0 The big Contra-versy — Ollie North,
charismatic Marine Lieutenant Colonel,
told the nation he went to Parklane
Hosiery to buy leotards for his two little
girls — not sexpot secretary Fawn Hall.
The Ollie. North show has pre—empted.

Committee

it would be a good idea to assign

Conklin said Physical Plant will

soap operas everywhere to become the
new No. 1 daytime drama.

°.Goetz didn't get it — Subway

vigilante Bernhard Goetz was found in— 

nocent of attempted murder after he shot
four young men on the subway in an act
of self-defense. His case sparked debate
all over the country over vigilantism.

0 Return of the Dead — Grateful Dead

fans crawled out of the woodwork (some

of them looked like they actually did) to
see Jerry Garcia and his band of the Jello-
mold—on-acid variety jam (or jell, if you

prefer) across the country.

0 How ’bout those Pirates? — Yeah
how about them?

I

0 Dominic and Eugene —'— Hollywood
has nothing to worry about, butjamie Lee
Curtis and Mike Farrell are filming the
movie here in the ”River City.”

Stay tuned  I'm sure this in only the
beginning. -

’’It is too small to get around in
a wheelchair; turning around was
almost impossible,” he said.
The only other majorlproblem
Sestili encountered, he said, was

”There are only two elevators
that go to the cafeteria, and some-
times they were locked,’,’ he said.
”Once I was in the cafeteria, I
didn't have any problems; it was

Yesterday, Lt. Col. Oliver North fl
gressional investigating committee. 

   
 
  

 

MATTHEW
THORNTON  

Have you noticed the change
in the air? Yes, the sweet smell of
moral cleanliness has invaded the
campus, and everyone’s basking

.in the new odor.

I just wonder who bought the

_ ‘ ‘stocks.

"Are we selling our interest in

 ‘apartheid on the open market?
I f What a way to make a profit.

. That's really the only thing I
have to_ say this week, so you can
go on to something else if you
like. To anyone who's going to
stick around for the whole grue-
some thing, though, I guess some
‘sort of an explanation is in order.

Here in the office, there are

 some days when just nothing
H ._ goes right. Not that this is the
. only place in which that occurs

— far-from it, actually. Yesterday

A just happened to be that kind of

day.

Sometimes, you find out at the
last minute that you have two
pages to fill instead of just one.
That really doesn’thave to be a
problem, but if you've reserved
the last minute to do yourplan-

ning, things can get a little tight. I

Anyway, yesterday_was a day
like that. Something had to be
done, and I" had to do it. l_was

e ; told once that you should always

pick the best person for a job, but
that's obviously something that
hasn't yet gotten popular around
here.

This, then, is the answer to the
problem of lots of space and not
much copy.

It's called a list column. Or a
bullet column. Or a bullshit
column. It just depends on your
perspective._ _

, It's funny sometimes to think
about what people in the news
would make goodcouples. Ob-

’ viously, there are so_me problems

in picking the right partner for a
life in center stage. Look at Fawn
Hall. OrJessica Hahn. Henry Kis-
singer. Gary Hart. The list just
goes on. .

I'd‘ like to help those people
out, and‘ so is born the first and
probably last Matthew Thornton's

‘ ”Vice Styles of the Wretched

Famous.”

0 Bud Dwyer. Here's a guy that
should definitely hook up with
Woody Allen. If there's anybody
that understands the depressive
personality, it'd have to be him.

0 Dwight Gooden. If Nancy
Reagan didn't already have a
mate, this would be her next best
choice. Imagine the TV commer-
cials. Just say no, kid, then hit the
ballpark.

0 Shirley MacLaine. Lyndon
LaRouche would fit the bill nice-
ly, thank you. Every couple
should have something in com-
mon, and what better than ‘the
whole nether-world?

0 David Byrne. How about
Sandy Duncan. The guy plays a
hot guitar, sure, but does he like
Wheat Thins? And what about
pixie dust?

Olmelda Marcos. The only
man able to handle this lady
would have to be Elton John. I bet

the matching sunglasses and shoe

 

?Who strange peoples your

collections would be in all the
stores by Christmas.

0 Johnny Carson. My pick here
is Vanessa Redgrave. Just one
time, I'd like to see Carson have
a real concerned expression‘.
Vanessa has it down.

0 Ted Kennedy. Tina Turner.
She may not be pretty, but she
sure can drive.

_ 0 Ollie North. The only name
that comes to mind is Jane Fon-
da. Put the two of them together,
and they could run the country.

; ’’It’s going to be a lonely winter

if you start that war ..." and so on.

.0 Wesley Posvar. What this
guy needs is a woman with early

America ideals. Calamity Jane?‘

Did you see him in the converti-
ble with Roy Rogers? The bicen-
tennial and all that. «

° Paul Simon. Cher is the lady
here. I "only want to see them
stand next to each other on stage.
Her with the perfect body and
him with almost no body.

0 Joe Cocker. Is Rosyln Carter
still on the available list?

Does anybody else feel the
need_for a break from this? I'm
having trouble thinking of famous
people. They're never around
when you need them.

There ‘was a question I had
about the Iran-Contra hearings.
The way things have been going,

everybody taking the stand has.
' shifted the blame a little down

the line, and we're all left with
the notion that the next person to
testify is the one able to answer
all the questions. How long will
it be before the blame all gets
shifted to William Casey? The
whole_ thing will have to be
dropped. ‘

dle Barrows is about the only per-
son sharing his vision of the

,world of crime. Behind the green

dreams?

door. Behind the basement wall.
Just way behind. '

0 Jerry Falwell. The only thing

keeping Him from the halls of,

American power is his reputation
-' for vulgar displays of conviction.

Abigail Van Buren would provide

just the right touch of polish.

0 Fidel Castro. Here's one for
the fashion magazines. The bag-
gy, unkept -look with something
nice and sunny. Christy Brinkley.

0 Joan Rivers. She doesn't have

a very good self-concept, and she

looks like she could use some

security in her life. Abu Nidal

would be just the man. Do you

think Fox network would take her
back?

0 Al Gore. He needs some up-
town influence in his life. He may
get a lot of rural votes with the
boy scout approach, but it's not
going to work in the city. Maybe
Gloria Vanderbilt. ”Reallahy,

darhling, you've just got to vote .

for this dearie.”

0 Ronald Reagan. -The man_

doesn't need a wife or a mistress
or anything like that. He needs a
medium. Complete with robes
and crystal ball. I know I'd sleep
better at night.

And so there it is.‘ The last list
of ai listless summer. Thank you
for listening. ‘

But wait, they tell me, there's
still more space. There's this lit-
tle guy in the back stretching the
pages. There's nothing I can do;
I have to go on.

-How about those Pittsburgh
Gladiators? They don't sound like
a football team; they sound like
a sales force for a trash bag
company. I

A trash bag. Hmmm.

The revolution that just won’tdie.

MARK
BROWN

Even the youngest student at
Pitt has heard rumors of the ”sex-
ual revolution," which in a theo-
retical sense has slipped
somewhere between the strateg-
ic stalemate and the strategic
retreat. What has happened to the
good intentions of so many?

Despite the baby boom of the
'50s, America was fairly puritan-
ical — or so Hollywood would
have had us believe. No unmar-
ried person had sex back then,
did they? Not as naive as period
propaganda indicated, folks be-
gan to experiment with the prac-

tice of not having sex until the

wedding night. This is the first in-
dication of the more liberal '60s.
No way single folks had sex be-
fore that.

Bu_ll.

With the '60s came change.
College enrollment swelled.
”Why become hamburger in the
carnage of Vietnam when a

young person could hang out at
a university for years and party?
The '60s was the biggest popular
dissent ever. Grow your hair
long. Quit wearing shoes. Don't
do whatjohnson and Nixon want
you to do. Go against your par-
ents’ wishes. Abandon material
beliefs. .

Out of this hairy, unbathed seg-
ment of society came the term
”free love.” You can experience
a closeness with someone else
without the bondage of marriage.
Sex, which was pounded into my
brain at a Catholic grade school
as being a sin, became something
normal, pleasurableand a great

‘way to get to know someone.

No one ever heard of AIDS or
herpes in the '60s or '70s. Back
then, the worst a person could
come down with from sexual ac-
tivity was easily cured with a lit-
tle penicillin or some flea
shampoo. Television, by now a
more important tool, was bom-
barding us with fairly base near-

nudity. The amount of material ~

sewn into bikinis shrunk im-
mensely, and nudist ‘colonies and
on-premises swing clubs multi-

Was it live 
or was it memorex?

Q. Can a man fake an orgasm?
The last time we had sex, I think
my lover did it to cover up los-
ing interest in me.

A. It is more likely that he did
it, if he did, because he feels in-
tensely about you. There is no
need to jump to the conclusion
that when a sex partner fails‘ in
response, or performance it

means a loss of love or sexual in- '
terest in you. Yes, a man can fake.

an orgasm when he is sharing in-.
tercourse and begins to lose his
erection. He can act out the body
movements and vocalizations
and everything except the actual

ejaculation. He can't fake being aroused, but he can cover up a loss
of function that occurs during intercourse.

I think this is what has happened with you and your lover, and
I would ignore it, because in every sexual relationship there are little
mishaps. To bring up the subject of his once-in-a-while low perfor-
mance can make difficulties for a man that he doesn't need and his

female partner doesn't need.

The whole male sexual mechanism is delicate — and I don't mean
that men are wimps or silly egotists — because a loss of sexual confi-
dence can happen to a nice modest man who is also a football play-
er or a prizefighter. The best thing now is for you to show an arousing
and reassuring interest in him as a sex partner.

Q. I can't tell if my wife has orgasms or is faking it. How can I

be sure?

A. You can't, because women do not produce incontrovertible evi-
dence of being involved in the sex act the way men do by having
an erection. Women can act out having the wildest ecstasy, and you
have to trust them. In away, it is a beautiful thing, because you have
to have faith in your wife's good faith. Nothj.ng else will do.

In the long run, a woman who is not having orgasms is likely to
lose interest in sex and betray her lack of interest by avoiding sex
with her partner for a variety of reasons — which she may even be-

lieve herself.

Some time when you and she are close and trusting, but not in
bed, tell her you want to do whatever is pleasing to her while mak-
ing love, you want her to tell you what she wants and to teach you
how to please her best. That shows a desire to please instead of a
lack of self-confidence,'and it does not accuse her of faking..

direct rejection of the neurotic‘

aversion to sex as naughty, dis-
gusting, filthy and only per-

abundant evidence of ignor-
ance, bad taste and a total lack

choose to use your (I'm sure)
valuable time putting down a
lonely man's request for cor-
respondence (did I spell that
right)? Sure, his vocabulary

May I assume that‘as a stu-

. would offer just a little hope

to scare us into thinking the way
good submissive Americans are
supposed to think: Recreational
drugs are bad; recreational sex is
naughty.

Repression of sexuality, to folks
who used to enjoy it rather
casually, can only lead to trouble.
Combine that with government
stomping on the erotica industry
— with the millions it rakes in an-
nually, obviously indicating a
desire on the public’s part — and

prostitution being outlawed in_

most parts because it wasnever

neurotic population.

La   Bamba ...

 
 

_Donna (Danielle Von Zerneck) is the love of Ritchie Valens (Lou Diamond Phillips). She is
the inspiration for his starmaker song in Columbia Pictures film La Bamba.

    

Wednesday, July l5, i987

Lou Diamond Phillips as Ritchie Valens will sing his way
into the young girls’ hearts —— but critics won't be swayed.

La Bomba

Valens’ life story too short to sustain feature film

By Ike Shibley

Staff Writer .

La Bamba is the tragic story of Ritch-
ie Valens, a Mexican-American laborer
who hit the'_big time with three top-10
records: ”Come On Let's Go,” ”Don-
na” and ”La Bamba.” Valens, along
with Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper,
was killed at age 17 in a plane crash
in 1959,. ‘

Written and directed by Luis Valdez,

' the film chronicles the short life of Va-

lens. Valdez described the film this
way: ”This.is about Ritchie's personal
struggle with his music and his rela-
tionship with his family, especially ex-
ploring the conflict between Ritchie
and his half brother, Bob.” '

Valens’ real name was Richard
Valenzuela. He grew up in the San
Fernando Valley with ‘his mother.

In 1958 he joineda local band but
quickly decided to try to make it on

~ his ‘own. Bob Keene, president of Del-

Fi records, recognized Valens’ talent
and helped him reach stardom. _
Listening to Keene’s advice, Ritchie

V shortened his name to Valens. Within

eight months, he had three hit records
and was touring the country,

La Bamba follows in the footsteps of
several other. biographic movies like
The Buddy Holly Story, Coal /vIiner’s
Daughter and Sweet Dreams. Unlike
these three films, though, the amount
of biographic material available was
limited. There was not much informa-
tion on Valens that the filmmakers
could draw upon to help in the telling

I of the tale.

The central problem with the film is

that it should have never been made.

This is not to undermine the impor-
tance of Valens’ work to the history of

rock ’n’ roll music. He made a sizable

contribution in a short time by fusing
Latin sounds and rhythms with a rock
beat ~
However, thereis only so much
maturing a" person can do in 17 years,
and in this case, it was not nearly
enough to create a feature length film.
The movie tried desperately to in-
crease its running time by including
several unimportant and uninteresting
scenes. There was so much develop-
ment of Ritchie's brother Bob that a

movie about him may have been more y

appropriate. .
V The details of Ritchie's life were
tedious. His rise to the top was so

meteoric that it took no time to '
chronicle it on celluloid. Instead, Val-
dez opted for trivialities that were terr-
ribly unnecessary. V
The acting troupe was young and in-
experienced. Lou Diamond Phillips, a
newcomer to Hollywood, had the lead
role. He was believable if not overly

' poignant in his portrayl.

Esai Morales played Bob with a
heavy-handedness that grew trying
quickly. He overplayed every scene in
an attempt to infuse his character with
life.

Rosana De Soto, who played Ritch-
ie’s mother Connie, sufferedfrom an
opposite ailment. She was languid,
lifeless and listless.,There was no
spark to her.‘ . -

The movie itself may have been a
disappointment, but the music was
not. Because the original recordings of
Valens’ songs were in poor condition,
the filmmakers’ opted tosign Los Lo-
bos to re-record all the Valens’ tracks
used in the film. Every track they do is
permeated with energy and en-
thusiasm. S

Lead singer David Hidalgo sounds
remarkably like Valens. Los Lobos not
only performed their own material but_

also appeared in the movie as a
brothel band.

Carlos Santana scored the sound-
track with Miles Goodman. His
characteristic guitar pulses throughout
the film. The original music he and
Goodman wrote blends wonderfully
into the fabric of the film.

Several established musicians turned
in respectable cameos. Marshall Cren—
shaw showed up as Buddy Holly and

. sang ”Crying, Waiting, Hoping.” Brian

Setzer appeared as Eddie Cochran
singing ”Summertime Blues.”

Howard Huntsberry brought Jackie
Wilson to life for the film and per-
formed ”Lonely. Teardrops." These
were not the only performers who lent
their talents to make the music in La
Bamba soar. Bo Diddley, Little
Richard, Chuck Berry, The Big Bopper.
and The Platters can all be heard as
well. ‘ .

Taylor Hackford and Bill Borden had
good intentions when producing this
film. Unfortunately, the material was

just too weak to support a motion pic-

ture.

On a scale of one to ‘IO, this movie
rates a four (i.e. two and one-half Lola
Fees). ‘

Cabaret heats up summer Stage
for an evening of naughty fun

CABARET
Apple Hill Playhouse
Through July 19

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Entertainment Editor

Apple Hill Playhouse in Del-
mont heats up its season this sum-
mer with the current production’
of Cabaret. The show is a look at
the romance between a strug-
gling novelist and nightclub
dancer amid the pre-World War
ll decadence of Berlin.

The production is sinfully
entertaining, as well as political-
ly loaded. As the master of
ceremonies for the evening, Paul
Zielinski is sadistically sexy. His
character seems to know what
the future holds for the other
characters, as well as for Germa-
ny. Zielinski takes command of
the stage as he welcomes the au-
dience, and his performance
never wanes throughout the en-
tire evening.

not a dance band. I guess we
are a difficult band to put a

label on,” Hedeker said.

Performance Art _,

One label that might be ap-
propriate is ”performance art.”
_ While performing, Algebra
Suicide wears white costumes;
Colored slidesflash on them,
changing their appearance to
match the mood of the songs.

But Hedeker shys away from
the performance artist lable or
any label at all.

”We are a lot more like a
band. I would not classify Al-
gebra Suicide as performance
art. People who come tosee
us are interested in music.”

Well-educated Bohemians

The band's unique sound
was created when Hedeker,
who was playing in another
band met Tomkiw at a "time
when she was doing poetry
readings.

The two decided to mix
their art forms, taking a phrase
from one ‘of Tomkiw’s poems
as their namesake, and Al-
gebra Suicide was formed.

They aren't the typical rock-
n-roll type of couple. Hedek-
er is going for his Ph.D. in be-
havioral science, and Lydia is
a widely publishedwriter and
editor. .

Then again, they aren't the
typical rock-n-roll type of
band.

Anschluss

Strange. Anschluss is
strange.

The band seems to follow
no form of music as we know
it. The synthesizers and guitar
treatments are disorienting,
there are no percussions to
provide stable backgrounds,
and the lyrical rambling seems
improvised. I

town will give is sure to en- ,

The emcee he portrays is the
epitome of the wickedness ram-

pant in Berlin; Zielinski embod-
ies this evil force with his taunting
vocals and sneering laughter.

The other negative force in this
play takes on a less fictional
dimension. Ernst Ludwig is a
friend of the common citizens of
Berlin. He is also a Nazi Party
member. His wickedness isn't
promiscuity, but his determina-
tion that Germany would best be
ruled by the leader of his party —
Hitler.

T.C. Brown is menacing as the
stern-faced soldier. His rendition
of ”Tomorrow Belongs to Me” is
beautifully haunting. However,
his amiability in the opening
scenes is contradicted by his
more threatening ‘behavior
toward the end. Nonetheless,
Brown‘ succeeds in his per-
formance.

Against these forces are the

young lovers. Caught up in the-

nightclub party scene is Sally

Boston A100 loudspeaker developed by
Andy Petite. He is the co-designer of the

We have carefully analyzed why our .

These expensive systems have very wide
frequency and dynamic range, great clarity,
and a natural balanced sound. After-
listening to and testing hundreds of medium

those that come closest to the sound quality

one of these components could substantially

Sharon Connelly plays the role
with ease. She sings and dances
with a smile that says, ’’I love be-
ing on stage.” Conne|ly’s impres-
sive feat isn't the singing and
dancing, but the acting.

This high school graduate
doesn't fall into any _teen atti-
tudes. She's cool and collected
on stage — a performance no less
than professional.

Unfortunately, her counterpart
Christopher Pinto gives a lack-
luster performance. His vocal ta-
lent is evident when he sings, but
his line delivery becomes rather
monotonous.

Overall, Cabaret is an enter-
taining, though not flawless
production. Oftentimes, the Ger-
man accents wereinconsistent
and the chorus of Kit Kat Klub
girls seemed hesitant on a few of
the songs. The production does
have enough strong talent,
though, to makeit a worthwhile
evening.

This album is a compilation
of highlights from the Prince's

”in'the gracious presence of
their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess of Wales.”

The album contains a bevy
of great performers — Dire
Straits, Paul McCartney, Rod
Stewart, Tina Turner, Big
Country, loan Armatrading,
Suzanne Vega and Howard

Jones — doing some of their
more popular songs.
Because it is live, none of
the versions quite match the
quality of the studio
recordings. .
Many live albums are made
to capture the energy of a per-
former that is often absent in

the sterility of a recording‘

studio.

Unfortunately, the en-
thusiasm and energy of this
concert is never quite felt. ’

The best track'on the disc is
Rod Stewart's ”Sailing.” He is

.'one of the few singers whose"

performance pleases the ear.

”Money For Nothing” by
Dire Straits sounds garbled.

Eldridgenamed new   SID for Panthers

By Mark Cohen

For The Pitt News

Larry Eldridge Jr., sports publi-
cist at ABC Television in New
York City for the past year, was
named sports information direc-
tor at the University of Pittsburgh

- on July 14. His appointment will.

be effective Aug. 3.

Eldridge, 33, replaces Jim
O'Brien who earlier this month
assumed a new position as assis-
tant director of outreach pro-
grams in the university's
admissions office.

”We_ have been fortunate
enough to have recruited a per-
son of Larry Eldridge’s demon-
strated skills and background,”

Pitt Athletic Director Dr. Ed Bo-
zik said in making the announce-
ment. ’’I am confident he will
bring to our program a‘ high
degree of professionalism, talent
and enthusiasm. l look forward to
him joining our team?’

Eldridge brings to his new po-
sition at Pitt a strong base of ex-
perience in sports public
relations, creative services and
sports information on both the
East and West Coasts. A native of
Philadelphia, he is a 1975 gradu-
ate of Villanova University where
he earned his B.A. in English.

Following graduation, he be-
gan his professional career at
LaSalle University where he
served in the dual capacity of
director of sports information and

assistant news bureau director. in
1978 he moved to Yale Univer-
sity as director of sports infor-
mation.

In 1981 Eldridge was hired by
the National Football League
Properties, lnc., in Los Angeles to
be associate editor for the crea-
tive services division. In that ca-
pacity his responsibilities were
conceptual development, writing
and editorial supervision for NFL
publications, including league
official guides and directories, the
Super Bowl and Pro Bowl game
programs, PROLOG, Gameday,
PRO! and a variety of trade books
and magazines. Additionally, he
sewed as a contributing editor for
The Official NFL Encyclopedia,

and as a writer-editor for a diverse '

range of NFL Properties market-

ingand licensing programs and
publications. ,

Returning to the East Coast, El-
dridge joined ABC Television in
July 1986 in sports public rela-

tions. In that capacity he has been‘;
responsible for publicity and pub- ‘

lic relations efforts, _including
events coverage, senior produc-
tion and administrative execu-
tives and broadcast talent. His
specific duties have included
ABC's Monday Night Football,
Major League Baseball, ’ the
Professional Bowlers Tour and
boxing. He has also been in-
volved in supplemental assist-
tance on ABC's Wide World of
Sports and planning for the 1988
Winter Olympics in Calgary.
.As a freelance writer, he has
written promotional and advertis-

ing copy for films, product -
brochures "and promotional
materials. His feature stories have

. appeared in the Christian Science

Monitor,‘ Sports Digest, Touch-
down, The World and I, the
Boston Globe and the New _
Haven Register. tn,t_his regardhe " '

is following in the footsteps;Qfl)':'; "
father, Larry,'who is the jspo,/rtgs;
editor of the Christian 'Sciengé
Monitor. ‘ ‘ 

    
  
 
  

”This is a terrific opportunityf
with one of the finest athletic pro- "
grams in the country,” Eldridge
said about accepting Pitt's offer.
”Pitt has many outstanding
resources, including its people,
its leadership and its great tradi-
tion. I’m looking forward to be- I

— ing a part of an excitng era in Pitt

athletics.”

-By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

Despite rumors that Brian
Shorter has failed for the third
time to pass his SATs, both the
Pitt basketball office and ath-
letic department contend it is
just hearsay. Both of these
offices have yet to see any
scores.

”We have not seen any
scores or received any word
yet on his progress,” said as-
sistant basketball coach Norm
Law. ”Whatever has been
said, heard or read it is simply
not verifiable at this moment.”

When using the term
”read,” Law is referring to an
article printed in the Sunday
edition of The Pittsburgh Press
stating that Shorter’s scores
had been released. Law said
this was a misprint on the
Press’ part. »

But no matter what comes of
the SAT or ACT scores (he has
also taken the ACT, both
scores are outstanding), he will
still be able to attend Pitt on an

Lying in wait  
Shorter’s scores still not known

scores in question are used in
determining eligibility solely
by the NCAA.

John’ Bolvin, dean of the
College of General Studies,
described the role Pitt plays as
the official determination.—

' ”The bottom line is that the
student first has to be admitted
to the university, which Brian
Shorter has,” said Bolvin.
”Once this is accomplished,
the eligibility rules revert back
to the NCAA. They do
whatever they do with it, and
then it kicks back to the
university.

Bolvin said that an athlete in
CGS has requirements to meet
just as any other student does
in any other college. By the
end of their freshman year, the
student must have accumulat-
ed a total of 24 credits and
maintain a minimum QPA of W
1.8. By the end of the sopho-
more year, it is 50 credits and
the same minimum QPA.

In the junior year, it is 80 ac-

‘ cumulated credits and a 1.9

minimum'QPA, and in order
to meet the qualifications for

graduation, the student must
have a total of at least 104
credits and a minimum QP
of 2.0. ' s

‘ Of course, if any of these re-
quirements are not met during
any point of the student's -
career the threat of either pro-
bation or suspension is
pending.

It has yet to be determined
exactly what school Shorter ’
will attend. However, as stat-
ed above, he will attend Pitt
on full athletic scholarship.

In dertermining scholarship
eligibility, the athletic depart-
ment has little authority under
the provisional guidelines set
by the NCAA rules committee.
The funding for the scholar-

. ships is supported through the

financial aid office.

After a player signs their let-
ter of intent saying they will at-
tend Pitt, the athletic director
will usually write to the finan-
cial aid office asking for ‘as-
sistance. Also,,the monies are
sometimes raised by the Gold-
en Panthers, entirely separate
from the athletic department.

Despite rumors, Brian Shorter might still play.

Rick Pitino

 

 

By Rick Warner

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — For almost

three months, basketball coaches
throughout the country had
sought the New York Knicks’
coaching job. None was offered
the position, and most eventual-
ly lost interest.
3 Rick Pitino never did. A
" .-The Knicks offered ‘the job to
the 34-year-old Providence Col-
lege coach last_ Friday and, after
consulting with his team Mon-
day, Pitino. accepted. .

Pitino, who led the Friars to the
Final Four last year, said leaving

there," he said at a news confer-
ence. ”But I couldn't turn down
the challenge of coaching the
Knicks. If I didn't take the job, I

would. have always wondered

about it.”

Pitino, a Knicks’ assistant under
Hubie Brown from '1 983 to 1985,
recently signed a five-year con-
tract "extension at Providence
worth a reported $320,000 ‘a
yeah

”I had a long talk with him
Saturday morning and told him
Providence College would not
stand in the way of his profession-
aladvancement,” schbol Presi-
dent Rev. John Cunningham said.

”He didnot ask meto get out of

was 100 percent happy_'

Pitino proves he's a Knick above the re t A

the contract. I extended it to
him.”

Pitino, a New York native, was
the first candidate interviewed by
the Knicks after they fired Coach

‘Bob Hill and General Manager

Scotty Stirling on April 20. He
withdrew his name from con-
sideration May 1 after the "Knicks
failed to meet his hiring deadline,
but changed his mind when the

‘team offered him the job‘ last

week. .

.’Guru’ G-arfinkel

Howard Garfinkel moves
through his camp as if he were.
everywhere at one time. He is a‘
mass of controlled energy, over-
seeing his Five—Star camp and
making each athlete feel special,
even if he is only average.

As I sat down to talk with ”the
guru,” I found myself amazed at
the kind of influence this man
could ‘wield in the basketball

' world.

I listened as he conducted bus-
iness.~ One moment he‘. _.was

 ,r_r1omer1t.l‘.-c“- was telling me that in
 ‘ t'ne’next couple of hours Rick Piti-
 no’ would be named the new»

‘Sure enough, later that same

7day, the wi-re carried the story of

Pitino’s signing.
He is a man of contradictions.

~ One moment he is very open, the

next he is reserved.
While he was very candid

-.. .....

about the Pitino story, he was not
so candid with his opinions about
many players.

The interview began with the
story of how Five-Star was found-
ed. Garfinkel said it was some-
thing he always wanted to
pursue.

’When I was a youngster, we
were always talking about how I
would buy the camp from the
director and run it right,” said
Garfinkel.

This passion for excellence
shows through in everything con-
cerning the Five-Star camp. .
Garfinkel is obsessed with mak-
ing each camp the best it can be.

”The function of the Five-Star
camp is to teach basketball. 
We want to make them [the par-
ticipants] better players and bet-
ter people,” said Garfinkel.

He went on to say that the
camp can make lousy players
fair, fair players good and good
players outstanding.

These are lofty goals for a four-
week camp. But as one watches
the players move through the
practice drills, one can see these
kids beginning to improve.

Garfinkel did not have much to
say concerning the the class of
'87, but seemed very impressed
with the class of '88. Garfinkel
feels the best two players in the
class of '88 are Alonzo Mourning

and Billy Owens.

lncidently both of these cagers
will be in Five-Star camp, but not
at the same time.

While Garfinkel was noncom-
mital on recruiting, when it came
to the three-point shot his opin-
ion came through loud and clear.

”The three—point lin.e is going
to destroy the game,” said
Garfinkel. He feels the line is
ruining guard play, but he did
find one good thing about the
three-point line.

”The line is a valuable tool for
lining up the players to see lec-
tures,” said Garfinkel. ”The court
is too small now.” He would like

s sage advice

to see both the court and the lane '
widened to accomodate the play- ‘

ers of today.

Finally Garfinkel commented
on what he would be doing if he
was not running the basketball
camp.

He mentioned the fact that he
would like to work with an ex-
pansion team as director of play-
er personnel. But after thinking
quietly for a moment, he said he

would want to be in some form ‘

of show business.

I left his camp thinking how
well his last comments defined
the man. If he was anything, he
was a showman.

to—head in the unusual pairing of
two teammates in the final round
of diving.

’’It is almost unheard of at this
type of international competition
to have two athletes from the
same country competing in the fi-
nal round against each other,”
said Krug. ”Our USA'National
team dominated the competition
this year more than any other
country hasdone in the past 20

years,” said Krug. ”I would not
be surprised to see one or two of

_ these athletes on the Olympic

team next year.”
Karen LaFace, a senior at Ohio

E State" University and Tristan

Baker-Schultz, both of the USA
National Diving team, also con-

' tributed to the USA’s show of div-

ing strength.
Schultz won the women's div-
ing competition, while LaFace

; made it to the quarter finals
‘ where she was edged out by .500 -

of a point by a Swedish diver.
Coach Krug was pleased to

have the opportunity to coach

some of the countries most talent-

ed and upcoming divers, as well .

as the chance to interact with top
international coaches.
”Coaching the USA National
Diving Team afforded me an ex-
cellent chance to observe the best
international divers in action and
communicate with their
coaches,” said Krug. ”My partic-
ipation has benefitted me as a
coach by giving me new ideas to
work with.” _
Coach Krug felt a great deal of
pleasure in representing the
university at an international
event such as this. ’’I feel my par-
ticipation in this event will bring
a lot of prestige to our program
here at Pitt,” said Krug. "When

coaches from other countries ,

asked me where I coached, I was
proud to say, ‘at the University of
Pittsburgh.’ In that sense, I feel I
have put Pitt on the map.”
