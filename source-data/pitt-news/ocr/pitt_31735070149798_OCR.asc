A change to University policy about '

in tears.Thursday‘n.ight.' V
Junior Alice Haas started to cry

at last night’s Rainbow‘ Alliance _

meeting when she spoke about
how the policy change will affect
her. The l.GBTQ student group met
to discuss Tuesday’s clariﬁcation
of University policy, which now
requires transgender students to
adhere to the sex listed on their
birth certiﬁcates when using a
bathroom. ' _

“If I were to go intola men’s

room, how many peopleithink it.

would be safe for me?” Haas asked
the 20 attendees at the meeting.

“No one. I should be able to wake
up and go to class and not have ,

to worry about what if this time_I
go to the bathroom and someone
. attacks me?” . M g
‘ ‘‘I’m begging this organization
to stand together with me,‘because
I can’t do this alone,”-she said.-
The changed policy has sparked
. outrage among the student group,
inspiring some to ﬁght the change.
Tricia Dougherty, the president
of Rainbow Alliance, said at the
meeting that its ﬁrst action will
be a letter—writing campaign next
Wednesday. Dougherty said that
they plan to use theletter writing
campaign to show University of-
ﬁcials that students are “outraged”
and oppose the policy.

proposed budget cuts, the highest-

“We cannot make the type of cuts

ernor’s numbers are incorrect, and
my opinion is that there is a pattern

  Pitt police investi ate‘person of
c interest’ followingt ird homh threat

By The Pitt News Staff

Pitt police are investigatinga“person of interest”
regardingthe recent spate ofbomb threats made
against the Cathedral ofLearning. The investiga-
tion began Thursday, following the third alarm
to evacuate the Cathedral in nine days.

Robert Hill, auniversity spokesman, said in
an email that Pitt police have identiﬁed aperson
of interest, but have neither made any arrests
nor identiﬁed asuspect. '

‘ Pitt sent out an Emergency Notiﬁcation Sys-
tem alert at 9:46 am informing students that a
general bomb threat had been received for the
Cathedral. Like the two previous threats, no time
or location within the buildingwas speciﬁed in
the threat. The threat concluded with another
ENS alert, sent out at 11:39 am.

After the second threat on Monday, Pitt
Police chief Tim Delaney said that for security

 

reasons, he declined to discuss anything about
.the threats, including where they are coming
from, what the punishmerit for the false alarm
might be, and if the police believe the incidents
are related. . . - '
_ Pitt police evacuated the building at the time
of the threat,-and many people leftthe area sur-
rounding the Cathedral, not bothering to wait
to head b_ackinside. Someprofessors, however,
continued their classes outside. , i ,

Senior Natalia Holliday said the number of
bomb threats is getting extremely “irritating.”

“Someday, no one is goingto take it serious-
1y,” she said as she stood outside the Cathedral,
waitingto go back inside. . _

Sociology major Patrick Beymer is taking
the situation lightly. .

“I think ‘it’s a ﬁre"sale,” he said, referring
to the “Die Hard” movies. “Hopefully Bruce
Willis andjustin Longwill be here soon to save
the day.” I

billion due to the loss of the federal stimu-
lus and the use of one-time budget gim-
micks  we raided abunch of piggy banks

‘and spent all that money,” he said. -

The state government also borrowed
a tremendous amount to support its
spending. Payment of that debt, along
with growing expenses in medical assis-
tance and state employee pensions, has
put the state government in a ﬁnancial

_ bind, Costa said.

Corbett has aggressively pushed to
defund higher education, following up
last years 19 percent cut to the four state-
related schools with a proposed 30 per-
cent cutthis year. - « ,

Costa followed up his criticisms of re_—
duced funding for higher education 
examples of tax cuts that. the business
community has received under Corbett’s
leadership. .

“Over the course of the past few years,

' [the state government has] been very gen-

_erous to the business community,” Costa

said. “But when you have rough economic - H
‘times you can’t make those cuts [to state

funding] .” ‘

The senator moved from the state bud-
get to outlining the issue of voter identi-
ﬁcation fraud that was brought to light
on March 14 when Corbett signed House

‘ Bill 934, also known as the Photo«\/oter ID

bill, into law. It requires Pennsylvanians
to show valid government—issued photo
ID before they vote at the polls. In]anu—
ary the language of the bill was altered
to allow college IDs that haven’t expired
to  as well. i‘

Costa said state legislators are split on
this issue largely along party lines, with
Republicans advocating stricter laws on
presenting identiﬁcation before voting
and Democrats ﬁghting against the bill
before itwas passed into law aftera26—23
loss in the Senate.

“My own personal opinion is that it is
a mechanism to suppress voter turnout,”
Costa said; “A lot of people trivialize the
idea that an ID is not hard to get.”

Costa pointed to rural, elderly and im-
poverished citizens who may be alienated
by the state’s new identiﬁcation policy.
He argued that some people don’t have
the necessary paperwork, while the cost
and effort of renewing or getting a new
form ofidentiﬁcation may be enough to
‘dissuade others. ,

Since the bill has already been passed
into law, senate Democrats have decided
to bring suit against the state.

‘-‘We are in the process of bringing a
lawsuit because we don’t think it is legal,”
Costa said. “This is  part of a national
movement to suppress voter turnout for
this coming election.” '

Costabrieﬂy reviewed the importance

. ofinvestinginpublictransportationbefore

Freshman Harry Clapsis was the ﬁrst
to askaquestion. He brought up the issue
of transgender bathroom usage, which
Pitt announced a decision on earlier this

‘week: On campus, people are only per-

mitted to use bathrooms of their natal
sex, that which is written on their birth
certiﬁcate.

Costa didn’t say much apart from call-
ing for further examination of the issue,
but Clapsis was satisﬁed with the answer.
He said he appreciated that Costa admit-
ted he wasn’t well informed on the divi-
sive issue and agreed that a conversation
needed to be had. Clapsis -added that he
would like to see that conversation take
place in public rather than behind closed
doors. ' I S '

“I think Senator Costa did the best he
could,” Clapsis said. “This [Pitt] admin-

istration has fallen drastically short on t
. LGBT accommodations.”

Costa encouraged everyone in the
room to get involved in state politics and
make the government hear what they have
to say.

David Geiger, a member of Student
Government Board’s Governmental Rela-
tions Committee, said hewas disappointed
that Costa did not get the same attention
and audience size as Corbett did last week,
but appreciated the intimate atmosphere

. of the discussion.

“[Costa] took questions directly,” Gei-
ger said. “It’s deﬁnitely worth the early

8468 to seek alternat

_ By Michael Ringling
Sta_ﬂ“Wri ter

The future source of funding for the Colle- A

giate Readership Program is still undecided,
but at least one alternative source has signed
on to pay part of the $33,600 bill. .

The Student Activity Fund, which comes
from undergraduate non- College of General
Studies students, has been the sole source of
funding for the program, which bring cop-
ies of The New York Times and USA Today
to campus and gives students access to an

online version of the papers.
But Student Government Board President '

' James Landreneau set out to ﬁnd alternative

sources of ﬁrnding from the College of Gen-
eral Studies Student Government and the
Graduate 8: Professional Student Assembly.
So far, the College of General Studies has
agreed to fund $1,200 of the program, but’
for GPSA, that decision must wait until the
new board takes charge in the ﬁrst week -
of May.

Nyasha Hungwe, the president of GPSA,
said that although the executive board was
initially “gung—ho” about the program, the

program and graduate student approval. _

In order_to ﬁnd out what graduate stu—"'
. dents thought about the prograjri, GPSA put

a survey in its monthly newsletter that has
a circulation of about 4,000. He said that
38 people responded to the survey, and the
results were not what'Hungwe expected.

. Out of the 38 respondents, 14 voted in

_ wish the results would have been different.

But unfortunately, the numbers are not in

. our favor and neither is the budget.”
He acknowledged that the turnoutfor the ‘

poll was small, and he wants to work with
the deans of the different schools to ﬁnd a

more direct way~to poll students.

Hungwe said that his board’s termwill
end at the end of April, and the new board
will take over in May. With this new board
will come a new budget and a new president,
David Givens. ‘

Givens said that the budget of about’
$100,000 for the.GPSA is signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of the Student Govern-

. me-nt Board, but that he wants to reassess

graduate/students’ thoughts on the program.
He plans to conduct another survey of his
constituency to gauge their interest in the

program and is considering factoring the

program into the board’s budget.

But he did have a concern about the pro-
gram. _ - » _ .

“One concern is our constituents are
so spread out across the campus,” Givens
said. He added that the board would need
to assess where graduate students frequent

and if the boxes thathold thepapersneed

to be moved.

College _of General Studies Student Gov- —

’ ernment President Pat Szczepanski said her
board voted toapprove the $1,200 proposal
by Landreneau. But, she and Landreneau
are still discussing the placement of the
boxes. _ " _ -

Givens has not yet met with Landreneau
to discuss the placement of the boxes. ’ _

The new drop boxes,,which will replace
the existing drop boxes, are set to arrive on
campus during the ﬁrst week of April. These
boxes will require students to swipe their
Pitt ID in order to obtain a paper.

_ The new boxes are meant to limit who T
can pick up the papers, since they are cur-

rently left unguarded in newsstands across
campus. I ‘ ‘

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,‘

Concerning The Pitt News’ March‘ 19 editorial commentary on privatiza- '

tion, two points bear clariﬁcation. *- .
The University of Pittsburgh, since becoming state-related in 1966, h

consistently established tuition increases in direct correlation with levels ‘

of appropriation support. Thus, the greater the appropriation, the lower
the required tuition increase. . n .

With respect to ﬁnancial disclosures, the University alieady discloses

substantial amounts of ﬁnancial information. Among these disclosures are

' the annual operating budget, the ‘capital budget, audited ﬁnancial state-

ments, the Federal Form 990 tax return and the annual audit of the Pitt

appropriation from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Pitt advocates for an end to the cuts in state ﬁmdingtso that the University _
is able to remain public and continue to offer ﬁrst-rate education at one-half

to one-third the tuition charged by comparable private universities.

Yours truly,
Robert Hill
Vice Chancellor, Office of Public Affairs

THE STAMATTACK

The perils of using ranch dressing
I a GO BACK TO YOUR '
  HIDDEN VALLEY, YOU MONSTER!

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

I bet many of you love ranch dress-
ing. V

I bet that when you open a pizza
box, the ﬁrst thing you look at is

in _' not the glorious pile of cheese and

sauce, but the unremarkable cylin-
dricalcontainer in the corner.

You see the ranch, and you feel
an easy. shot of pleasure. And you
know you’re not alone.

Our nation’s obsession with
ranch dressing doesn’t reach too
far back. Before 1992, according
to Slate, our favorite dressing was
Italian — a delicate oil suited for
h'oagies andlettuce but little else.
Chemists had not yet developed

‘a stable recipe for ranch — yes,

ranch comes from a laboratory,
not a, well, ranch —— and we all
contented ourselves with eating

V food not covered in mayonnaise

and buttermilk. _
But oncelthe recipe was perfect-

ed, three terrible trends made the

dressing’s dominance inevitable.
First, in an era of political correct-
ness we had to collectively ﬁnd the
least offensive topping available,
and the bland, non-textured white
cream served as a suitable symbol
for our desire not to affront each
other. .

Second, our increasing “health
awareness” made us more suscep-

. tible to marketing that advocated

“health awareness,” leading ev-
erybody toassume that some-

° thing named after a rural pasture

couldn’t possiblybe fattening —

a minor miracle considering that‘

ranch is, by weight, half fat, beat-

-‘ ing out even water in mass.

Finally, ranch offers an easy
solution to every culinary prob-
lem in the world. If something
is too spicy or too bland, ranch
seems to somehow make it work.
Anything offensive about a potato
or meat dish can be covered in a
heavy layer of lipids and turned
into something everybody, age one
to 92, can tolerate. -

’ A Now, ranch is so entrenched
in our lives that we hardly notice
it. A Chili’s menu, for instance,‘
has_29 mentions of ranch, heat-
ing bacon at 26 and any vegetable
I could think of. While ranch still

loses to cheese’ — thank goodness -

— it’s striking how something that
wasn’t even perfected 30 years ago
has smothered our culinary land-
scape. ’ ' '
The rise of ranch since the early

’90s stands in sharp contrast to the '

decline of another once ubiqui-
tous food item: toast. In a survey of
food trends over the past decade,

' ’Harry Balzer, the vice president of

consumer marketing research ﬁrm
N PD Group, listed the oft-buttered
browned bread as the largest de-
cliner. While Americans have been
ingesting more'breakfast sand-
wiches and on—the—go foods, toast
consumption has diminished.
This is hardly surprising, con-
sidering how taken Americans are

with-‘ranch. -Toast requires 216 .

  

Illustration by Ben Kaye

seconds to prepare properly, an
eternity in our instant gratiﬁca-
tion ranched-out society. Ranch
represents the antithesis of toast:
a ﬂowery, substance-less mess
squirted wildly everywhere in a
world that more than ever could
use a solid foundation. c

The transition from toast to
ranch is not meaningless for so-
ciety as a whole. Food holds a spe-
cial place in our culture because
everybody, regardless of income or
status, needs to eat. Furthermore,
foodis not something that people
interact with casually — unlike
fashion, music or art, nearly every
time we interact with food, we are
making an active decision to con-
sume something speciﬁc.

Food is as cultural as a cul-

ture gets. To paraphrase French

foodiphile Jean Anthelme Brillat-
Savarin, if you know what you eat,
you know what you are.‘

For this reason, we should be
concerned that people-are picking
ranch over toast. Decisions about
food reﬂect our naturaldecisilon
making process. From a public
health perspective, more than 15
grams of fat inptwo tablespoons of

, anything should freak people out

enough. But the ranch philosophy
-— quickly cover up anything with
some enhanced mayonnaise — is
potentially just as damaging‘-in
termslof social consequences.

_ Just think of politics.;Why ad-
dress serious long—term debt issues

when we can squirt some ranch on

the problem for a few months by passing a
new debt ceiling increase? Why lo0k.at our
long—term traffic congestion crises when a
quick federal bill to pave some roads will do?
Why try anything big in your own life when
I could watch another episode of “Downton
Abbey” and be just as happy for now?_

So next time you are presented with the
option of ranch or toast, pick the option that
will bring you the most long—term happiness.
Pick toast. I _ - -

To the Editor,

Compassion is a virtue. The procedure

sexed facilities shows a _lack of compassion
toward the LGBT community. The portion
of the administration responsible for this

needs to reach out to transpeople_for un— I

derstanding. This policy unjustly deﬁnes

a transperson and denies transgendered.

students and staff safety.

_ For transpeople, gender doesn’t match
genitals. But most transgendered people un-
dergo hormone therapy. This changes their

Pitt hopesto give  

1 Louisville first loss

' By R] Sep_ich'
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt softball team begins Big
East Conference play this weekend
on the road against one of the three
remaining undefeated teams in the
nation: the Louisville Cardinals.
After splitting "a doubleheader
Wednesday at home against St.
Francis (_Pa.), the Panthers will

t now head south to take on the

No. 13 Cardinals in a three—game
series —— the opening series for
both teams’ Big East seasons.

Freshman pitcher Savannah
King, who/is the Panthers’ ace and
leads the team with 11 wins, said
she believes the possibility of end-
ing Louisville’s undefeated season
could provide extra motivation for
Pittthis weekend.

“I’m pumped for our ﬁrst Big
East games, and we want to be able
to say that we were the ﬁrst team
to beat them,” King said. _

Pitt head coach Holly Aprile
said the team is excited to begin

conference play. “Since we’re fac-
ing a really tough team, we need
to refocus and get going,” Aprile
S3.lCl.~ -
Having already traveled to
‘other states 4 including Texas,
North Carolina, Florida, California
and'Virginia.—- over the course of
the ﬁrst two months of the season, '
the Panthers are used to facing stiff
opposition away from home.
“The past ﬁve weekends have
deﬁnitely prepared us,” Pitt fresh-
man pitcher Alexa Larkin said. ~
“We’ve faced some really good
competition leading up to this
weekend, so we’re excited for this
challenge.” ' .
Pitt iswinless, in its three previ-
ous games against ranked oppo-
nents this season, although two of
the games were settled by two runs
or less. Louisville’s pitchers and
batters have compiled impressive

1 statistics in guiding the team to_an
unblemished record.

  Pathers read for Bi East

By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ‘ Writer L

Coming off a lossto Penn State on
Wednesday, the Pitt baseball team
will get the chance to bounce back
against a Big East opponent this
Weekend. ' ’
Pitt’s coaches are more familiar
with teams and individual play-
ers during the conference season
and Notre Dame — the Panthers’
weekend opposition — is no ex-
ception. , 7 u
The Fightinglrish have 13 ju-
niors and seniors that Pitt head
coachjoejordano has seen in their
youngeryears. .

“In-conference games are deﬁ- .

nitely games that we go into with
better knowledge of our oppo-
nent,” Pitt senior Rick Devereaux
said. “We will use our scouting
report, like we do in out-of—con—
ference games, but it is important
for us to stick to our plan and play
our game.” A '
' Sophomore Steve Shelinsky
agreed. . , '
“Our coaches do know our con-
ference opponents a little better,

The Pitt baseball team will open Big East play on the road against Notre Dame this weekend.

but as a team, we strive to play our
game,” Shelinsky said. “it does not
matter who our opponent is that

particular day. As long as we stick_

to_our game plan,‘ we’re going to
make it a very difficult day for our
opponent.”

He added that it’s important
for the Panthers to stay with their
game plan.

“We can’t allow the reputation
of our opponent to play into the
way we play our game,” he said.

The Fighting Irish, led by sec-
ond-year head coach Mik Aoki,
were chosen to ﬁriish sixth out
of 12 teams in the Big East in the
coaches’ preseason poll. Pitt was
selected eighth.

After the Panthers swept Hart-
ford in their home—opening series
last weekend, they fell to Penn
State 5-3 on Wednesday in State
College. Despite the loss, Pitt con-

» tinues to play well, considering it

lost three out of its ﬁrst four games
this season. - ”
Shelinsky said the Panthers are
gaining conﬁdence as the season
progresses.
“Our conﬁdence level has deﬁ-
nitely grown coming off of a four-

‘ not prepared to face.” 3

   

game winning streak,” he said.

“We are starting to click on all
cylinders.” A

Pitt-defeated Michigan State be-
fore picking up three wins against
Hartford. .

With a 10-8 record through
the nonconference schedule, the
Big East slate offers the Panthers
a fresh start at pursuing the post-
season. '

“Our team will continue to work -

on our entire game as we prepare
for the conference schedule,”
Devereaux said. “We’ll try’ to be
a better team every time we step
on the ﬁeld.”

The Panthers’ bats have started 

heating up in recent games, and
Pitt needs solid offensive output to
continue as the tough conference

' competition approaches_.

“As a team, I believe that we

were happy with how we hit lately,’’ ,, ,

Shelinksy said.
A “There is always more to ‘work
on, but as long as we concentrate

on sticking to our‘ game plan of— '

nounced on Thursday that this year’s Pitt
Spring Football Festival and B1ue—Gold

A Scrimmage on April 14 will be held at North

Hills High School instead of Heinz Field.

Chryst said in a release that he decided
to move the spring game to North Hills
in order to embrace _the tradition of high
school football in western Pennsylvania.
North Hills is located about 15 minutes from
Pitt’s campus. .

“I may be new to Pittsburgh, but I’ve re-
spected and known about the traditions of
western Pennsylvania high school football
for a long time,” Chryst said. “As a ﬁrst—year
coaching staff, we feel it is important to get
out and engage the people and communities

who have built that tradition. The spring
game is a perfect opportunity to do this,
and we’re really looking forward to visiting

, North Hills in April.”

The game will be held at Martorelli Sta-
dium. Gates will open at 11 a.m. with a youth
clinic at 11:30 a.m., followed by the annual
Blue- Gold Scrimmage at 1 pm.

N o_rth Hills High School athletic director
Dan Cardone said in a release that Pitt is be-
ginning a “new and exciting era” with Chryst
and that North Hills is “honored” ‘to be a part
of the ﬁrst spfing game of his tenure.

“Thisis another stellar example of how
Pittsburgh’s highest—proﬁle football teams,
the Panthers and the Steelers, are invested in
the communities of western Pennsylvania,”
Cardone said.L“It is a winning equation for
everyone involved and we’re excitedabout
