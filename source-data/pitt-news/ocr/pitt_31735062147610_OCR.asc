This Is The Biggest Free

Ron’s Feature Concerns
Today’s Pitt News
Style Parade

, By Ron

This has been goingon for years
now. A_s far back as you or I ‘can re-
member.’ Or at least as long as, or
longer than we've been around here.

A few years back there was only an
annual frenzy in The News office with
Will Berman, long ago
screaming “Style Show, thrilling, stu-
pendous . . etc.,” in your corre-
spondent’s ear. And came forth from
one of the better typewriters a futile
orgy of extravagance about what a per-
fectly ducky time every one was agon-
na have, what with The Pitt News
paying the bills.

As it turned out, the annual Pitt
News style show and dance turned out
to be pretty good fun, and thousands

of present students have been sold on
the idea ever since.

Under former Advertising Manager
Ellis H». Tumpson, BA36, who, for the
last two years has been business man-
ager of The News, it’s no longer an
annual event but, unlike ' Christmas,
comes twice a year. .

-This year it comes once today.

Beginning at 2:30 o'clock in the ball-
room of the Hotel Schenley, at least a
thousand students (there have always
been that many) will be present to dis-
cover what’s correct for this or that
over the fall and winter months. Pitt's
ﬁnest, -says Tumpson, will do the mod-
eling, and the city’s ﬁnest, says Tump-
son, will display their ﬁnest wares for
male and female “stackings.”

Bray’s Orchestra to Play

Jimmy Bray’s orchestra will give a
melodious background throughout the
showing of fashions, and will then dou-
ble in dance time until 6:30 o’clock.
Sometimes the dancing gets a bit
crowded, but it’s still pretty good fun.

Oh yes, has anyone mentioned that
it’s all free?

Among the choice specimens of fem-
inine beauty who will parade about in
silks, satins, furs, formals, and foot-
wear are: Dorothy Abraham (plenty
smooth), Alice Barchﬁeld (quite).
Madeline Batty (ahhh), Betty Black
(welll), Phyllis Blumenfeld -(yes),
Frances Calhoun (also), Beverly Chil-
dress (ducky), Ruth Donley (striking),
Doris Evans (you know), Myrtle Gor-
don (rather), Audrey Graham (as if
you didn’t know), Jo Kunkle (whee),
Margaret Lewis (indeed), Irene Ma-
roney (of course), Rose Nugent
(cutie), Vivian Roberts (smooth, too),
Emily Sneddon (you agree?), Margaret
Spear (just too too), and Louise Mc-
Kirdy (my my my my . . over-
whelming).

The men aren't nearly so many~—
11 to 19—but they make up for lack
of numbers in waves of handsome-
ness. They are: Chuck Allcroft,
Johnny Baker, Ben Baskin, Gene
Burkhart, Chuck Ebert, Bernie Flem-
ing. Harvey Goldstein, Tom ‘Howard,
Bob Madden, Louis Mammone, and
Chuck Perrine. And they‘re all big-
shots from the top of the list down.
Druids or something, every one.

Hose, Ties Are Door Prizes

Added to all this stuff, there are
extra inducements to show yourself
around the hotel this afternoon. Can
you use a pair of silk hose, Wise Shoe
Company's best? Or one of the ﬁnest
ties Leonard's Men’s Shop has for
sale? There are eight door prizes al-
together, and this year the raffling
will be on the square. I remember
once when Omer Kronenwetter, a
publications man, won a tie, but . ' .
well, that’s all done away with now.

If nothing else looks good to you,
remember that the following outstand-
ing Pittsburgh ﬁrms are displaying
fall and winter fashions: Fintex Co.,
345 Fifth Avenue, men’s suits and
overcoats; Meyer Jonasson, Liberty
and Oliver, women’s gowns; Max
Azen, 705 Penn Avenue, furs; and
-Wise Shoe Co., 235 Fifth Avenue, wo-
men's shoes.

Miss Grace Ely of the University
Retail Training Bureau and Mr. Mel
Morgan of Fintex, will comment on
the styles shown.

Legislative Head
Of Norway Plans
  1/isit Ne._x_t Week

The President of the Parliament of
Norway, who is second in that coun-
try only to the King, will be on cam-
pus next week to address University
students.

, Mr. Carl Joachim Hambro, in this
country under the auspices of the
American - Scandinavian Foundation,
has accepted the invitation of Dr.
John G. Bowman, Chancellor, to speak
here fourth hour next Tuesday in
Memorial Hall. All classes will be
dismissed from 11:30 to 12:30 o’clock.

Mr. Hambro, a graduate of the
Royal Frederiks University in Oslo,
former instructor -at Oslo Handels
Gymnasium and at the Vestheim
School, was also editor-in-chief of the
Morgenbladet, conceded to be Nor-
way’s leading newspaper.

He ha.s been a member of the na-
tional parliament since 1919,-serving
as president since 1926. He was a
member of the committee which ne-
gotiated a treaty with Denmark over
Greenland’ in 1925, and has been prin-
cipal Norwegian delegate to the
League of Nations since 1926 and a
member of the League's executive
committee for the past ﬁve years.
His work at Geneva has brought him
international prominence.

Chancellor Bowman will preside at
the Assembly.

Although Dr. Bowman and Mr.
Hambro have never met, they will
not be complete strangers when the
Norwegian statesman arrives. While
the Chancellor was in Norway a ‘num-
ber of years ago, it was Mr. Hambro’s
son who served as his official guide
throughout,the country. -

 

Trooper Guards

Liquor Quizzes

In case you have noticed any
State policemen wandering around
the halls in the Cathedral the past
day or two, don't be apprehensive.
There is no plot afoot to steal the
Cathedral. As a matter of fa.ct,
the State Troopers are around to
oversee the guarding and marking
of the examination papers of ap-
plicants to the State Liquor Con-
trol Board.

The papers are being marked in
Room 728, Cathedral, by students
of the University and Frick Train-
ing School.

Dr. W. _P. Jones, head of the de-
partment of public construction
in Harrisburg, is in charge of the
examinations held by the Pitts-
burgh branch.

The examinations were given
Saturday to approximately 1800
applicants from all over the state.

Cameraman Dixon Wins High Praise

For Film Of Gotham Easter Parade

By Chester Harris

Curiosity, plus a hobby, can lead to
almost anything. To Russell A.
Dixon, instructor in economics at the
University, they almost resulted in
nation-wide recognition among ama-
teur movie makers.

Dixon, whose chief hobby is making
ﬁlms of interesting subjects, spent
last Easter in ﬁlming the church-
goers at St. Bartholomew's Church,
New York City. The ﬁlm, of the eight
millimeter variety was an hour and
15 minutes long and comprised a
study, at interesting angles, of the
crowded steps of the church.

Included in the ﬁlm were many
prominent New Yorkers‘of various
walks of life, both in and out of the
famous 400. The ﬁlm was such a suc-
cess that its maker decided to send it
to the Amateur Cinema League of
America, recognized as an outstand-

ing authority on amateur ﬁlms.

They returned it with a report from
their continuity editor stating that it
was the “Best reporting on Easter
church going in New York City that
I have ever seen.” The league further
regretted that the film had not been
sent in early enough to be judged as
one of the ten best in the entire coun-
try.

Dixon went on to say that the per-
son selected as having the best ﬁlm
receives a gold medal while all ten re-
ceive nation-wide recognition as the
outstanding ﬁlm enthusiasts of the
year. ‘

Dixon closed the interview with the
hope that a “Movie Makers Club”
might be formed on the campus, add-
ing that a great many members of the
faculty were already enthusiasts and
that it could be expected to take its
place along with the other popular
clubs at the ’ University.

New Deal ‘Tried’
Says Substitute
inquiry Speaker

“Never Go Back To Old Days,”
State Deputy Attorney General
Claims; Hits Republicans

By James Donoghue

In a purely political talk before a
special session of Inquiry Forum Mon-
day, A. A. )/Volk, state deputy attorney-
general and legal counsel for closed
banks, stressed the fact that the New
Deal has at least tried to bring about
better conditions, even if in actual
point of fact it has not always suc-
ceeded in its aims.

Mr. Wolk spoke in place of State
Senator George Rankin, Jr., who was
prevented by illness from making his
scheduled appearance.

In March 1933, Mr. VVolk contended,
the Republicans agreed with -the
Democrats that something had to be
done. But after the New Deal admin-
istration had given business a “hypo-
dermic injection” of funds, the Repub-
licans began to criticize and cry “Let’s
go back to the good old days.”

“The United States,” Mr. Wolk con-
tinued, “will never go back to the
good old days. The Democratic party
of today is a new party with an old
ideal that was never put into prac-
tice. The object of government is to
satisfy the wants and desires of the
great body of people. The Republi-
cans want to satisfy the wants and
interests of the vested interests.”

The party in power has the duty of
satisfying the interests of the great
body of people, -and a party should
“remain in power only so long as it
is responsive to the wants of the peo-
ple,” he added.

The New Deal, according to the
speaker, has put more “humane legis-
lation” on the statute books than any
other administration, even if the Su-
preme Court has nulliﬁed such meas-
ures ,as»the NRA, and holds an im-
pending axe over the extended necks
of the AAA and the TVA.

The forum which followed Mr.
Wolk’s talk was marked by desultory
arguments over the number of people
on relief and as to whether they were
deserving. It lacked altogether the
pointed questioning that has distin-
guished previous meetings of the
group. ,\*_,,_

Scientists Show
Electric Marvels

Two Demonstrations Will Be Held
In Memorial Hall Tomorrow

 

In the demonstration from the Gen-
eral Electric research laboratory
which will be held in Memorial Hall
at 11:30! and 3 o’clock tomorrow, stu-

-dents will have the opportunity of see-

ing at ﬁrst hand some of the most
recent developments in electronics
and physics.

This presentation, in effect, adds
the resources of the Schenectady lab-
oratory to the more limited laboratory
facilities of the students.

The 11:30. showing will be exclusive-
ly for engineering, mining and science
students. They will be able to ob-
serve how the more elementary prin-
ciples of electricity, sound and light
are being put to work at modern
tasks of industrial research, in some
cases to discover vital changes in the
elements themselves.

High frequency, one of the most
modern tools in its application, plays
a large part in the experiments. To
date it has been used principally in
the medical ﬁeld where it is utilized
to create artiﬁcial fever in patients
brought within range of this minia-
ture broadcasting station. Since it is
possible by this means to control tem-
perature accurately as well as to raise
it, high frequency, it is thought, will
soon ﬁnd an increasing number of
uses in the industrial ﬁeld as well.

There will be several demonstra-
tions involving the photo-tube, or
electric eye, which afford a striking
example of how the gap between pure
science and everyday application is
being bridged.‘ Willoughby Smith,
who was in charge o_f a. cable station
in Ireland, discovered the principle of
the photo-tube in 1873. {He found that
the effect of the selenium resistance
rods which he used in his equipment
was reduced to a marked degree when
light fell upon them.

This discovery, after passing
through several stages, resulted in the
modern electric eye, which today per-
forms a variety of tasks — sorting
beans, turning schoolroom lights on
and oﬁ according to the amount of day-
light present, driving fumes from un-
derground tunnels, and reading meters
at a distance.

A11 seminars which are held at 11:30
o’clock Thursday morning are dismiss-
ed in order that the engineering and
mining students can attend the dem-
onstration. Faculty members, the en-
tire student body of the University,
and families and friends of the faculty
and students are invited to attend the
second showing at 3 o’clock. It is par-
ticularly stressed that the audience
must be seated promptly at the sched-
uled hour.

The Soph Hop committee will meet
today at 2:30 o’clock in Room 801,

will be formally introduced to
students of that school at a special
College Association assembly fourth
hour today in Memorial Hall.

‘Be Wise, ’ Warns
The Owl, ‘Go Now
For ThatPicture’

Dark rumors are being bruited
about the campus to the effect that
Mr. Babit, who snaps the pictures of
the senior class for the 1936 Owl, sits
and waits in the Merin-Baliban studio
at 3514 Fifth Avenue for seniors to
come and have their pictures snap-
ped and that they just don’t Come. In
fact, to date only 26 seniors have
done their posing, and all of the
seniors must have their Owl pictures
taken, before the _end,,_g_f‘l}loven1ber.

Seniors may call up and make "the
necessary appointment just as soon
as they have made their down pay-
ments on their copy of the Owl.

Meanwhile Anne June Elmer, C36,
editor of the Owl, has been busy mak-
ing tentative appointments to the ed-
itorial staff. Jackson Sigmon, BA38,
will have charge of the section on
men’s oganizations; Stanley Rogalin-
er, C37, of the men’s fraternities;

Editors of women’s fraternities and
women's activities sections have not
yet been chosen. Candidates for these
positions, or any other students who
wish. to work- on the Owl staff, should
see Rogaliner in the Owl office, Room
709, Cathedral, some time this week.

McGovern Talks
At Forum Today

As the ﬁnal speaker of the
present political series, Inquiry
Forum will present Charles C.
McGovern, County Commissioner,
at 12:30 o’clock today, in Room
107, Alumni Hall.

Mr. McGovern is a candidate for
reelection to the County Commis-
sionership on the Square Deal
ticket, along with Mr. C. M. Barr,
also a Commissioner at the pres-
ent time.

Both men have alienated them-
selves from the regular Republi-
can organization, and have set up

an independent organization
known as the “Square Deal
Party." This party hopes to gain _

' at least a minority if not a ma-
jority on the next Board of Coun- '
ty Commissioners, by appealing
to the dissatisﬁed elements of

Dr. Crawford To Meet
Students Of School
At Assembly

Students in the College will leave
classes at 11:30 o’clock this morning
to attendageneral assembly at Memo-
rial Hall called by the College Asso-
ciation to introduce the new dean of
the 0011986. D1‘. Stanton 0. Crawford.

Dr. Crawford has no set subject for

.today’s address, but promises to speak

on several phases of the topic: “Get-
ting the Most From a Four-year Col-
lege Course.”

Charles B. Holstein, ’36, chairman
of the assembly this morning, will in-
troduce Dr. Crawford. Gertrude
Schein, ’36, and Edwin Beachler, '37,
are also on the assembly committee.

The College Asociation, headed by
Paul Keiser, ’36, president, in sponsor-
ing the meeting, is attempting to
bring about a closer relationship be-
tween students in the College and the
College ofﬁce, as represented by the
dean. To give students an apprecia-
tion of what the officers of the school
can give in the way of assistance and
advice in chartering courses and
careers is an important aspect of their
project.

Last year the Association was
called upon for a like task in intro-
ducing Dr. Herbert L. Spencer, dean
of the College for one year and now
president of Pennsylvania College for
Women.

Dr. Crawford had been previously
connected with the University for a
number of years as director of high
school relations, and in that capacity
has addressed innumerable gather-
ings in high schools at which the ma-
jority of present University students
prepared.

The faculty of the School of Busi-
ness Administration is playing host
today to an international authority on
economics, Frank H. Knight, pro-
fessor of economics at the University
of Chicago.

Professor Knight is one of the best
known economic theorists of the Eng-
lish-speaking world. He is one of the
editors of the “Journal of Political
Economy,” published at the University
of Chicago, and has written many arti-
cles expounding his theories in pub-
lications throughout the world.

The economist will take part in two
affairs during the afternoon. There
will be a luncheon served in his honor
in the special dining room of the Fac-
ulty Club, which is scheduled for
noon, and will be attended by faculty
members of the School of Business
Administration. Professor Knight will
give a short address at the gathering
on the subject, “The Prospects of So-
cial Sciences.” In his talk, he will
emphasize the future of economics.

At 4 o’clock, he is to conduct a.
seminar in Room 1309, Cathedral, with
graduate students of the school in at-
tendance. In this round table meet-
ing, various economic theories will be
discussed.

During the morning, and between“

the luncheon and seminar, Professor
Knight will be in the ofﬁce of the
Dean of the School of Business Ad-
ministration, Dr. Charles S. Tippetts.
He will talk to faculty members indi-
vidually, consulting with them, on
their work.

Fourth Hour Freedom

V ODAY’S ASSEMBLY IN MEMORIAL HALL
Tbrings Dea.n Stanton C. Crawford before the
College as a group for the ﬁrst time. There is
every indication to believe that the interest of stu-
dents in this particular school to hear Dean Craw-

ford speak will discount greatly the number of‘

those to whom an hour off for an assembly is no
more than an hour o.ﬁ‘:'. - A

Declaring an omission of classes for an -hour al-
most invariably works a hardship upon professors
and instructors, particularly those who are trying
to keep several sections of a course in pace. For
that reason, the free hour is declared as rarely as
possible and only for occasions deemed highly im-
portant to students. It is indeed unfortunate that
some of them have not weighed these values closely
enough to make a point .of attending assemblies.

The message which Dean Crawford is to present
today is bound to have an appeal for every College
student. Last summer Chancellor Bowman took
Dr. Crawford from his position as director of high
school relations to make him Dean of the College.
Those who know the new Dean are convinced that
no ﬁner -selection could be 111ade. A banner turn-
out today at the College Association’s Assembly
should be gratifying to him as he continues Work
at his new University post.

Not everyone, immediately, can get to know
Dean Crawford personally; the chance to become
acquainted is offered to all at the fourth hour
today.

329 Freshmen Know Their University

Three hundred twenty-nine fresh-
man men were successful in passing
their orientation examination last
week, according to incomplete returns
released yesterday by Charles Herald,
C36, chairman of the SFA customs
committee.

This means that 329 new gold pins
may be seen on the lapels of those
ﬁrst-year students
school, its history, traditions, and cus-

toms, to the satisfaction of the cus-

toms committee and their upperclass
counsellors.

Other freshmen who were unsuc-

cessful in passing the test are being
given another chance this week, and-

Herald conﬁdently expects a substan-

tial increase in the number of gold-

pins distributed.

Said Herald:
with the results of the orientation pro-
grani, thus far, and -I am looking for-
ward to increased ‘success as the cus-
toms pro_gr_am swings into the third
part of its agenda.”

Panthers Begin November
Campaign In Fordham Tilt

Team Prepares For First Game In History With Rams;
Fordham Record Shows Four Wins, One Loss

With the half-way point on the schedule reached, Coach “Jock”
Sutherland ’s Panther football team went back to work on .Monday to
get in shape for the strenuous November pigskin campaign which
opens at the Polo Grounds Saturday afternoon when the Pitt eleven
meets Jimmy Crowley ’s Fordham aggregatioii.

The contest on Saturday will mark the first time that a Panther
gridteam has ever matched football ability with a Fordham eleven.

It will also be Pitt’s ﬁrst appearance%

in Gotham since Dr. Sutherland took
over the head coaching duties.

Both outﬁts have identical showings
on the won and lost column for the
present football season. The Ra.ms
have tasted defeat only once, losing
to Purdue by a 20-0 score. To bal-
ance this loss, the Fordham outﬁt has
hurdled four opponents successfully,
taking the teams Franklin and Mar-
shall, Boston College, Vanderbilt_ and
Leba.non Valley into camp. Likewise,
the Blue and Gold boys have lost one
game, that to the Irish, and have come

out on top in the other‘ four encoun-‘
ters.

In their last two games. Coach,
Crowley has employed the same sort
of tactics that his coach, the late
Knute Rockne, used at Notre Dame.
I-Ie ha.s started his shock troops, giv-
ing them the job of tiring the oppon-
ents, and when the time is ripe, he
sends his varsity onto the ﬁeld.

‘This system-worked quite well in
the intersectional struggle with Van-
derbilt. After the reserves ‘had ham-
mered the Southerners to within 30
yards of the goal line, the Fordham
coach sent in the regulars, who pro-
ceeded to score twice in the ﬁrst
period.

Having faced a Rockne-styled out-
ﬁt just 10 days ago, the Panthers
should be partially familiar with the
modiﬁed Rockne system used by Crow-
ley at the Ram school. According to
reports from New York, the Fordham
coach is spending a lot of time in per-
fecting the ,_Ram’s forward passing at--
tack.

In Captain Joe Maniaci, the New
Yorkers have one of the best backs in
the country. .Maniaci, who weighs
195 pounds, received All-American
mention last season. He plays full-
back a.nd on the defensive is used at
the safety position.

May Start Regulars

If Crowley starts his varsity eleven
against the Panthers, it will probably
include the following players: Leo
Paquin and Johnny Druze, at ends:
Amerino Sarno and Al Saho. at
tackles; Nat Pierce and Vinny Lom-
hardi, at guards: Alex Wojciechowicz,
at center: Joe Dulkie. at mmrter: Jnn.
I-Voikowski and Frank Mautte, at half
backs; and Captain Joe Maniaci, at
fullback.

The shock troopers include: Bill
Ladroga and VValt Mitkus, at ends:
Jim Lawlor and Johnny Borzin, at
tackles; Phil Ma.rion and Al Babart-
sky, at guards; “Atlas” Gangemi at
center; George. McKnight. at quarter:
Steve Sorota and VVarren Mulrey. at
halfbacks; and Jack Gallivan, at full-
back.

Around the Fordham campus the
varsity backﬁeld of Dulkie, Woikow~
ski, Mautte. and Maniaci is known as
the “Four Mercuries.” Dulkie has
been out of competition for the past
couple of weeks because of an in,iur_v,
but he is expected to he in shape to
play against the Panthers. 'Woikow-
ski, a sophomore. handles the punting

and most of the passing duties.
Mautte, a 160-pounder from New
Haven. featured in the Vanderbilt

struggle, by running 87 yards for the
winning touchdown.

The Panthers will leave for
York tomorrow evening a.nd arrive
there Friday morning. They will be
quartered at the Ivestchester-Biltmore
country club located at Rye, New
York, about 25 miles from the big
city.

Panther Runners
To Meet Butler

Olson Will Have Full Strength
Available For Butler Contest

Carl 0lson’s Panther harriers at

least rate the title, “the scrappiest
team in collegiate cross—country
ranks,” in spite of the fact that .-they
have not registered a victory thus far
this season.

However, on Saturday Coach Olson
hopes for the initial Panther success
of the season, when the runners of
Butler University journey here to
meet the Pitt outﬁt. Olson will proba-
bly have full strength available for
this engagement, as Bud Groat, who
was out of the Penn State run, may
be in shape to face the Butler entries.

The Indianaboys will come to town
with a record of three victories in
four starts. Michigan State, one of
the strongest outﬁts in the country.
scored the only decision over the But-
ler team.

Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o’clock,
the freshman “B” squad engages
Langley and Peabody high schools in
Schenley
Park course.

On Saturday the Jayvees will travel
to Bethany for a meet with the
Bethany varsity. Those who will
make the trip to West Virginia are:
Walmsley, Steffenino, Follette, Con-
nelly, Loncher, Powers, Nordstrom,
Montroll, and Pfaff.

The Pitt

Yearling Eleven
To Face Nittany
Lion Frosh Next

Dissatisﬁed with last week's show-
ing, Coach Mike Milligan is putting
the freshman gridders through some
stiff paces in preparation for Satur-
day’s game, when the team travels to
Mt. Nittany for its annual battle with
the Penn State frosh.

Milligan is looking for a reversal in

form from the frosh gridders this
week, and is hoping to break in the
win column after getting two setbacks
in as many attempts.
A The Penn State frosh team has
shown real power at times this year.
They opened the season playing the
varsity in an intra-squad game, and
the varsity had to unleash all its
tricks in subduing the Frosh, 20-0. In
their next engagement they defeated
a fighting aggregation from Keystone
Junior College, 13-0. Last week they
met a strong Wyoming Seminary
team, and after scoring early in the
game, the Prep school eleven tied the

‘Kappa Sigs Beat

Pi K gleam, 6-0

Lone Score Made In First Half;
Arguments Mar Encounter

Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma
waged a typical Greek touch football
battle on the Schenley Oval ﬁeld Mon-
day, with Kappa Sigma winning, 6-0.

The only score of the game was
registered early in the ﬁrst period
when the Pi K A center passed wildly
over the goal line. and Beachler,
Kappa Sig end, fell on the ball for
the touchdown. First downs stood
three to one in the winners’ favor, but
the play was close throughout with
penalties marriug the offense’""of*‘both
teams. , .

Disputes cropped out in the very
ﬁrst period when Gollmar, Kappa
Sig, was charged with a ten-yard pen-
alty for running into the ball-carrier.
Groat passed and ran for two Kappa
Sig ﬁrst downs in this period.

In the second quarter, Truesch
pulled in a pa.ss for a 12-yard gain
and a-ﬁrst down as Pi K A" neared
mid-ﬁeld. At" half-time, ,R.1}.SS Lind-

‘ berg, referee, consulted’vgith_ the two
captains to move the playing ﬁeld to -

the regular gridiron, left vacant by
the Schenley High soccer team.

Playing on the regular ﬁeld, the two
elevens scrapped during the ﬁnal half
with Kappa Sigma in possession of
the ball in midﬁeld at the ﬁnal gun.
Late in the ﬁnal period, Manny Hyatt
intercepted l\/lcMunn’s pass and ran
down the ﬁeld. lt was ruled incom-
plete when two men on the same team
touched the ball. Considerable dis-
pute followed on the part of both
teams, but to no avail.

Previous to this, Groat tore off a 50-
yard run around left end, only to be
called back by a 10-yard penalty W116“
Mahonev clipped from behind on the
play. Kappa Sigma now enters the

sefcond-round for a game with Sigma '

Alpha Epsilon, runner-up in last

year’s tourney, on November 5.

Dear old Tech, Carnegie Tech, was
the top-notch performer Saturday
among future foes of the Panthers
this season, by virtue of a surprise
victory over Purdue. With one excep-
tion, all of the ﬁve opponents remain-
ing on the Pitt 1935 schedule came
through without defeat.

 

Fordham coasted to a 15-0 victory
over Lebanon Valley in prepa.ration
for the battle at New York Saturday
with the Panthers.

Army’s undefeated eleven marched
on to another victory by conquering
-Larry Kelley and.his Yale mates, 14-8.
Little Monk Meyer again proved his
worth by stealing the show for the
cadets, who continued undefeated this
season. '

 

 

The Huskers of Nebraska ﬁnally got
off on the right track again and
stopped a hitherto unbeaten Oklahonia
team, 19-0. Lloyd Cardwell showed
flashes of his early season form by
scoring two touchdowns and running
‘back a kickoff for 82 yards.

negie Tech’s Tartans put a great hole
in the boiler of the Purdue Boiler-

While all the world wondered, Car- A

Pitt Foes 

tory at Lafayette. A perfect pass
play, Matelan to Rosenthal, brought
the only score of the game early in
the ﬁnal quarter, after which Tech
managed to stave off frantic Purdue
attacks.

The sun continued to hide behind
the clouds out in Southern California
as USC took another one on the chin,
this time from its most bitter rival,
the University of California. The
Bears moved one step closer to the
Rose Bowl with a clean-cut; 21:7 vic-
tory over the Trojans.

Armbands To Be Discarded Friday
As Women Complete Custom Period

 

After Friday, November ,1, ‘there
will be something missing from the
campus-——the blue and gold felt arm-
bands which have graced the left
arms of all freshman women since
the week of September 30. The rea-
son for the disappearance of arm-
bands is that customs regulations will
cease on Friday. .

After the first of November, fresh-
man women will be able to run in the
front entrances of all buildings, sit on
any bench that is not occupied, trip
across Upperclassman Walk (this
should interest women engineers,
chem. specials, and all others who
have classes in Thaw Hall), and for-
get their customs identiﬁcation cards.

The customs committee of VVSGA
will entertain all freshman women at
a Football Brunch preceding the Pitt-
Nebraska game. From information
obtained from the members of the
committee it is evident
will be entertained royally. Tile de-
tails of the party will be published at
some future date.
