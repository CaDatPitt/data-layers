The heat “freeze” is caused by

a shortage of high-grade soft coal
due to the month-longicoal strike

' ,‘*_ in West Virginia. This particu-
‘ lar type of coal is used because

its low sulphur content produces

 less pollution than other types of
soft coal.

campus drug piishers

 

   

by CAROLE COVAL

, "I'm just waiting for the day
"when a heroin pusher can tell me
what he’s doing is OK," said Bob
(Ging,

/Using this example, he explain-
ed the rationale behind the plans
for .» a new student committee
which would strive to "clean its
own house" of the hard drug prob-
lem on campus.

The words “Stop the Pusher,"
or STP, define’ the name and the
aim of a proposed _student com-
mittee of campus organization
representatives who would be
willing to approach hard-drug
pushers and acquaint them with

the consequences of intra-univer-

.sity, or" court judicial processes.

'37.‘; -“I’m tired of being treated as a

géhild,” Ging said, “We should be
glealing with our problems; tak-
7ing the responsibility ourselves.”

Committees Commissioner

in 1» »Wade Lawson agreed.

“There’s no justification if
‘somebody dies from an overdose

tomorrow, if I didn’t do some-
thing about it today," he said.
"Remember the phrase — ‘You

all

find it hard to bury a friend.

Lawson and Ging bothfeel the 4

need for such a student-oriented
program is incontestable. .

"How could .you oppose helping
to clear up the drug problem?"
they both ask.

The idea for a student based
committee was conceived last
week when both Lawson and Ging
accompanied an arrested Pitt stu-
dent through perliminary charges.

Joseph Gil, Superintendent of
Campus Police, said he was talk-
ing with Ging and Lawson on one
subject, but that “when you talk

.about anything, the conversation
turns to drugs.”

"What the Campus Police can
doabout the pusher is rather

well known," he said. "but we
would still be dealing on a puni-
tive or corrective vein, not a pre-
ventative one.

The kind of student that may do
an effective job on this type of
committee was outlined by Law-
son, Ging, and Gil. As a prereq-
uisite. he must be concerned
about his fellow students, about
their learning atmosphere. but
most of all, he should be willing to
allow students to make their own
decisions.

The person who is involved in

the STP Committee will seek to
perform two functions. He will en-
courage those persons who have
hard-drug problems to seek some
kind of help and will also urge
hard-drug pushers to" “cease and
desist” trafficking, or face the
penalties that an investigation on
the university or city level could
impose. '
- “We definitely don't want a list
of X number of persons,"_ Gil
said. "but students should be
aware of the consequences of
their actions. They should know
beforehand what risks they are
taking in relation to their educa-
tion ifthey continue to push hard-
drugsf'

According to the University ju-
dicial process, an individual stu-
dent may take action against a
person who infringes upon his
rights. In the case of a “pusher."
a student may personally ap-
proach the problem of ridding the
campus of the "hard-drug ped-
dler.“

Ging said that if “students don’t
handleytheir own problems, the
Campus Police will do it for
them.” He cited last year’s stu-
dent complaints concerning drug
busts as evidence that this issue
is the responsibility of the’ student
population.

“If ‘we move the pusher out.
so goes the need for narcotics

agents," Ging concluded.

FREE TRIP TO BOSTON: Seventeen “guests” of the University were among those who flew to Boston Friday for
Saturday's football match with Boston College. Hotel and meal expenses for the T7 were picked up by the Uni-
versity.

A varying group of administrators, trutees, alumni, legislators, and corporate executives accompanies
the football team and the athletic staff to each away football game. The group is invited by the Chancellor.

According to C. R. Coble, executive assistant to the Chancellor, the number of guests invited is “tailored
to fit the plane." The airlines levy no additional charge for the passengers who are guests of the Chancellor.

The University invites guests outside the University as a goodwill gesture to Pitt. Administrators who trav-
el as guests talk to their counterparts at the host university and help raise funds at alumni sessions.

The guests who attended Saturday's game included: Roy Hunt, Jr. (vice-president, Mellon National Bank
and Trust) and his son, Andrew; Alfred Wishart (director, Pittsburgh Foundaion) and his wife; Dr. Douglas
Thompson (clinical associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Community Medicine—Magee-Women's
Hospital and his wife; Dr. Ray Coble (executive assistant to the Chancellor) and his wife; Robert Dunkelman
(executive assistant to the Provost) and his wife; Joseph Dutton (vice chancellor of Operations) and his wife;
Bernard Kobosky (vice chancellor of Public Affairs) and his wife; James Varacalli (assistant director of Special
Events), and Dr. Posvar and his daughter, Marina.

Womert advance union proposal

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

In addition to the Women's
Housing Board, Associated Wom-
en Students. and Pan-Hel, Univer-
sity women may have yet another
group to boast of.

Plans are now being formulated
for a new women’s union, The title
for the association will be the Un-
dergraduate Women‘s Union.

Ellen Ganley, organizer of the
effort. says that a constitution has
been drawn up and submitted for
recognition. Ganley said that one
obstacle may arise if the Student
Association feels that the new un-
ion will "overlap" with Wo.nen‘s
Housing Board (WHB) and Asso-
ciated Women Students <AWS J.

‘fActually,” Ganley explained,
“AWS and WHB deal mainly with
programming. We want to set up
a body open to all women. We hope
to take women’s priorities and
see what can be done about them.”

Ganley cited the alleged mis-
treatment of women at the Health
Center as one possible target for
a grievance committee. Plans are

A

for several committees working
simultaneously on various prob-
lems.

Another aspect of the Union,
Ganley said. will be setting up and
maintaining informational serv-
ices for anyone desiring them. She
said the constitution was loosely

and vaguely [organized in order
that, after recognition, the group
could commit itself to whatever

A issues it feels are most .impor-

tant.

The impetus for the new union
resulted (from, as Ganley put it,
“being sick of rap sessions.” She
also stressed the distinction to
be made between the Undergrad-
uate Women’s Union and Wom-
en’s Liberation.

“We don't want to be stereo-A
typed as a .Women‘s Liberation

V“.

group. We are feminists in the ..§«

sense that we will all be women
and that we will be working for
women," she explained.

Ganley said that after recogni-
tion, meetings will be held and
elections conducted. All women
will automatically be members
but a distinctionwill be made be-
tween "active" and "non-active"
members.

“We are calling ourselves a un-
ion,” Ganley said, “_so we need a
lot of people to get it going.” Gan-
ley anticipates an extensive ad-
vertising campaign‘ to generate
student support. ‘

In the event that the Undergrad-
uate Women's Union is not rec-
ognized as a legitimate student
activity, Ganley said that her
group willstill organize. '

“We want recognition partly to
receive money for office sup-
plies," she said.

Additional students work-
ing ‘with Ganley include: Cathi

Ritts (president of AWS), Pepper ,

Bulick, Cathy Davis, Jan Miller,
Gail Hornstein, Sally Kalson, San-
dy Miller, Miriam Smolover, Sue
Ruffner and Mary Jane Trunzo of
the Pan-Hel Association. '

The advisors will be Konnilyn

grams. and Connie Carroll of the.

by DENNY KLEPPICK

In 1966.9 the University of
Pittsburgh. in the words of Ig
Perez. "recognized that the Uni-
versity had an obligation to
assist in the development of the
community. a spontaneously-seen
need to utilize our facilities for
that development."

This recognition resulted in
the organization of the Center

for the Development of ,Ac-
tivity Programs for the Excep-
tional.

According to Perez. co-ordin-
ator of the Centers Leisure-
Learn Program. the "Excep-

 tional" are primarily those phy-
‘ " sically or mentally handicapped
persons for whom special atten-

tion and special recreational
and educational facilities are
necessary.

“We’ve expanded this defini-
tion to those who live in econo-
mically depressed areas and
areas which have few facilities
available for community use."
he said.

The Center is funded primarily
by the University. Additional
funds are received for special
programs from community and
state agencies.

Perez said that the program

was funded in the belief that
 “both the University and the
community could benefit from

a meaningful program of a so— ’

cial, recreational and education-
Val nature.“

Leisure-Learn

The Center is divided into
various sections which encom-
pass a variety of subjects.

One section, the Trees‘ Hall

 Community Leisure-Learn Pro-
gram headed by Perez, has made
available the recreational and
educational facilities of the
Trees Hall complex to the
neighborhoods near the camp-

-us.

Informed of this availability
by the University. community
agencies like the Hill Districts

, Ozanam Cultural Center and the
9 Center Ave. YMCA, and City
agencies like the Dept. of
Parks and Recreation and the
Police-Community Relations Di-
vision met with Perez at Trees
Hall to plan and coordinate pro-
gram activities.

Times were scheduled when
the complex was in least use
by the students.

Activities of the program” in-
clude organized athletics, arch-
ery, fencing, dance, slimnastics,
and an audio-visual club. Vol-
unteers from the participating
community" agencies assist in
the supervision .of these activi-

ties. -

 Perez stated that the "Univer-
sity's prime responsibility is.‘ of
course. to the student." L

With this ‘in mind. graduate
and undergraduate students are
provided with opportunities to

‘ become involved with members
of local communities in the
instruction and supervision of
various activities. _

A special project of the Lei-

ing the summer months. The
National Collegiate - Athletic
Association (NCAA) sponsors a
Youth Sports Program. The
NCAA underwrites the cost of
supervised sports such as gym-
nastics, swimming. basketball.
track and field events. in addi-
tion to: a nourishing lunch pro-
gram.

This project handles up to
200 kids for six weeks. _
Drug abuse education

Another section of the Center
IS the Leadership Development
Training Center on Drub Abuse

Education. one of three such
programs funded by Pennsyl-
vania.

During the 1970-71 academic
year it offered five workshops
on drug abuse education and
trained more than .30 school
district and community teams,
who were charged with de-
veloping and coordinating 'total

school-community drug abuse
programs. .
In line with the Drug Abuse

and Leisure-Learn policies, the
Center recently voted funds and
equipment to assist in the forma-
tion of a football team of ex-.
drug addicts and, boys in the ‘20

L‘ years and under age bracket.”

The theme of cooperation is
highly stressed.

“While the program is based
and primarily funded by the
University. said Perez. "we make
no attempt to dominate the plan-
ning. We feel it's essentialthat
the goals of the program are de-
cided by all of the groups in-
volved. Upon request. we also
provide volunteers to assist at

‘community centers distinct from

University facilities."

In accordance with this phil-
osophy, a voting membership of
over 40 community, city and
University organizations meets
weekly to discuss requests, vote
on projects and supervise the
hiring of personnel.

"If you have someone work-
ing here who might be. say.
radically biased, that would ali-
enate some of the community
groups." stated Perez.

GRE’s unfair, clainl students

by LOIS LEVINSON

The tribulations of the Gradu-
ate Record Exams evoked dis-
satisfaction and cries of unfair-
ness from Pitt students who were
subjected to them last Saturday.

The GRE Exam purports to be
an aptitude test that gives a fair-
ly accurate account of students‘
ability to continue their educa-
tion on the graduate level. The
test is three hours long and con-
sists of a verbal and math exam-
ination.

Many students who took the
test view it as an unnecessary
evil. »

Carl Van Horn said that. ra-

. ther than testing his reasoning -

powers, the verbal part “tested
the amount of time you spent
cultivating your vocabulary."
and that the math. though
straightforward, "was really an
achievement test. "

He said that the’ tests were a
"system certification" that em-
phasized‘ a particular culture
and were ther_efore as unfair as
l.Q. tests.

Van Horn said that “there is a
large disadvantage in that your

school may not give you the

‘proper’ education—vis a vis the
GRE.”

On the other hand. Jim Savage
stated that "because the levels
of education and the grading
systems are so diversified among
colleges. the test is needed to
provide a mean."

MILLER: Not even a good
achievement test.

BONN: An excuse for weeding.

Required to take the exam be-
cause he is in ROTC. Savage
said that the verbal part was
unduly difficult but that “every-
one who has been ,to college
should have known the simple

math concepts." He admitted
that his background has been
mainly math-oriented.

Margie Miller stated that the
test -“wasn’t too difficult for
someone who is reasonably intel-
ligent and has had four years of
college.” 4

However, she continued. ,“I
don't think it's going to tell
‘anyone too much about me."
She acknowledged that the test
probably 'won't hurt her or
helpiher and favored a personal
statement as a-more effective
mirror of ones‘ abilities.

All students interviewed agreed
that the graphs and the reading
comprehension parts of the exam
were the only sections that could

. really indicate aptitude.

“The test is used as an excuse
to weed out certain students,”
stated Bob Bonn. “There is no
conceivable way that the test
is going to tell anyone how
much you’ve learned and how
you can apply what you’ve learn-

required knowing “trivial bits

Joseph Blasi said, “The GRE:

- Will President Nixon's new economic‘

policies work in reducing inflation and
unemployment? «

The polls show the public has a con-
tinued confidence in the President's new
"game plan.“ According to a Newsweek
poll conducted’ bymthe Gallup organiza-
tion during the week. before September
27, 65%. of the U.S. voters still favored
the new economic program. -

There was also strong support among
union families. Even after AFL-CIO
President George Meany berated Nix-

on‘s new program, 54% of union families V
"still supported the Republican President.

More recently, this broad approval
of the President’s job in improving the
economy has culminatedin greater sup-
port for President Nixon. The most re-
cent Gallup poll shows 54% of Ameri-
cans think the President is doing a good
job; I '

Of. course, this honeymoon with the
public would end if Phase II of the new
economic program f'ails. The~conserva-
tive economist Milton Fried nan is some-
what doleful about the future. He sees

a potential danger in the new econo-
mic policy. ,1 - '

He feels that " . .-under cover of
the p_rice controls, inflationary pressures
will accumulate, the controls will col-
lapse, inflation will burst out anew. per-
haps sometime in 1973, and the reac-
tion to the inflation will produce a se-
vere recession.

‘ 2 coming to

"But most economists believe other»

wise. Economists of all brands from
MIT’s Paul Samuelson on the left to
Chicago’s Beryl Sprinkel on the right
predicted inflation would cool down and
that growth could reach levels of 6%.

Surveys of other professional econo-
mists show the same positive thinking.
They expect real GNP adjusted for price
increases will increase "a healthy 5 or
"A. next year and inflation will fall from
last years 5.9% to below 4% for 1972.

These predictions seem to be slowly
fruition. Wholesale prices
have dropped. the rate of consumer price
inflation has reduced. and interest rates

-havefallen. So the economic future'is

beginning to look good.

With all of these good omens, will
we really have the “very good year”
that President Nixon promised the
country for '72? Most likely we will
have a good year. The question is how
good. i

The Democrats can still make an is-
sue of the economy if the expected pro-
gress in the economy is not completed
by November 2. 1972.

Also their growing criticisms that the
President’s total economic package-will
not work»or work fast enough might
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. For
example, Democrats could indulge or-
ganized labor’s demands for their own
so-called brand of equity. in other
words,_ their right to get inflationary

They could also impugn the Presi-
dent for “favoring” business over lab-
or, undermining the legitimacy of the
wage~price controls. And then they could
wonder out loud whether any President
(especially a Republican one) should
have so much power over controlling
the economy.

This possible Democratic political
scenario would cause more uncertainty
and confusion about the future and
could sabotage the Presidents chances
of winning his battle with theeconomy.

Of course, the political strategy is
filled with contradictions and hypocri-
sy. The inconsistencies become appar-
ent when one considers how many De-
mocrats seem to ignore the monopoly
power of labor unions and seem to want
to forget, that they were the ones who
gave the President so much power
over the economy in the first place.

More importantly, none of these
possible Democratic criticisms have
really anything to do with getting votes‘.
Indirectly, this growing political divi-
sion on the economy in ’72 might under-
mine business and consumer confidence,
which would hamper the economy’s re-
covery.

However. my guess. given all of this
possible political confusion, is that we
will still have a "good year" both in
the economy and in politics.

My fearless prediction is that the
nation will "survive" in 1972.

'Stiideiits hold key to
a better approach’

| 0 N 
by SHARON M. LEINROTH
‘ Special to the Pitt News

A Today’s college generation is credited with having a great ‘deal
of concern over rights—rights of students’, blacks, women, taxpayers,
etc. That concern. apparently does not exist in many of the stu-

n dents who use Hillman L_ibrary.

I.do a fairly small amount of research at Hillman. But each“
time I have‘worked there, I‘ve found evidence of theft and mutila-

-tion of books and periodicals, evidence that to me is disgusting.

Sometimes it’s one or two books out of a list of seven or eight

that can’t be located. Coded “Hillman” in the card catalogue,‘ the.

books aren’t on the» shelves or recorded as charged’ out. They’re
“missing.” " . i

Once‘ it was the covers of two books that were brought to the H ‘.

charge-out-desk. '_'I found these in the first-floor ladies room,,"'msaid
the girl. “The books have been torn out.’,' - - '

The lastltimte it was pages ripped from three magazines;
pages containing articles on one subject, the subject of my research
and, unfortunately, another‘s, research. ’ P .

In—al‘l of these cases, what happened to my‘-rights? What hap-
pened.to- the rights of my classmates who had the same. assign-
ments and who also were denied access. to information that once"
was and still should have been available at Hillman?

_I talked with Sally Rowley, Coordinator of Information Services '. " in

at Hillman, about the problem. She agrees that it is possibly worse
today than ever before. ‘ ’- ~ —

Grade-school civics classes still‘ teach the 1-to-1 pairing of
rights and responsibilities‘. But it seems that many students have
learned only half of their lessons, the half about their .own “rights."

They‘ve disregarded the second, more important half which re-
lates to responsibilities. It is the latter which is the real basis of
respect for the rights of others. _ g \

Rowley reports that several approaches to alleviating the prob-

lem have been discussed. For example, closed-circuit television".

would help in cutting. down the mutilation, which is more difficult
to control than actual theft. But the costs_of installing and moni-
toring such a system are steep.

Electronic sensing devices could be planted in books, as has
been done at Carnegie-Mellon. Here again, however, cost is a seri-
ous factor.

In any event, these are negative approaches.—money spent in
undojng rather than doing. _At the same time, the costs of books,
periodical subscriptions, binding, etc., continue to increase. '

Why should funds so much needed to maintain subscriptions,‘
purchase new books, and ‘improve and expand services be watered
dow.n_to undo the damage or police the childish irresponsibility of
a minority of students? If that happens, all of us pay the price.

We students hold the key to a better approach.

“No student wants to censor his peer,”‘ said Rowley. “But the
students must help.” -‘

Don‘t ignore that fellow in the corner tearing alpage from
The New Yorker. The article he‘s pocketing today may be the one
you ll need to review next month. - 

The same thing applies to the young lady walking toward the

door. smiling at the guard ‘while hugging a binder containin'g- , .

a book she hasn’t charged out.

If the guard ‘doesn‘t stop her, you do it, 

she hasn't forgotten to charge that book she picl<e_d'-..u'pon.',t 'e.f' rd "

Feature Editor

The ‘University has announced
the names of its four candidates
for the Danforth Graduate Fel-
lowships for college teaching ca-
reers. The nominees are Kathy
Hanna. Joe Blasi. Gail Hornstein.
and Carl Van Horn.

The Danforth Foundation award
is for the academic or calendar
year. and is usually renewable
over the four year period. Dan-
forth Fellows may receive four
years of financial assistance. The
maximum Fellowship stipened is
$2.700 annually for single fellows"
and $2.950 for married ones. plus
tuition and fees.

Selction is based on criteria
from a number of areas. but the
applicant must provide evidence
‘of flexible and wide-ranging in-
tellectual power. as well as aca-
demic achievement: personal
characteristics likely to facilitate
effective teaching and construc-
tive teacher-student relation-.
ships; concern for the relation of
religious or ethical valuesto dis-
ciplines, socialland academic re-
sponsibility. and the educational
process.

History major Hanna remark-

. ed that she doesn’t view her_field .

as “tedious memorization of facts

—pure knowledge for the sake of ‘

“studying.” She said that she con-'

siders the study of history_impor-

tant. “because one gains insight
. into daily life and events.

Hanna also said that she be-
lieves such study to be "art and
a humanistic pursuit." Stressing
the importance of ‘communica-
tion of ideas as the basis of teach_‘'-
ing. Hanna said, "I see it as a mu-
tual learning experience."

Another candidate, Blasi, stat-

ed. "lf teaching doesn't begin to.-.

heal; then I_think it's going to be

worthless—and I‘m interested in’ ‘ '
' '.the union between teaching and

he"aling."

In addition to majoring in psy-, -T

fchology, Blasi is working on a
self.-designed major in human re.-

"One has to bring so many tal~
ents to bear’—not just knowledge.

s“The teacher has to be a sort of

He also noted. "It is not the ed-_

Frat high rise grounded, in

 by VIRGINIA COOK
_, 7 Little progress is being made
toward implementing a study sug-
gesting construction of a high rise
~.7ht7)using complex for Pitt frater-
*nities.
jln‘ January, 1970, the Universi-
vty, along with the housing corpor-
» ations of several fraternities,
commissioned the L. Arthur Lu-
. bits firm to do a feasibility study
for a complex that could house
‘ fraternities in dorm-like com-
plexes.
- Implementation of the recom-
'mendations has been halted be-
‘cause the University is presently
--embroiled in a controversy with
*" People’s Oakland over the Phase
Itproject. Joint planning with the
- city, thestate, and People’s Oak-
land is the commitment of the

‘  University.

But untilall four can get to-
gether and the University can
_‘ drag itself from the political quag-
‘_- n"1ire',‘the high rise complex will
-_gnot’rise from the drawing boards.
 Because most of the fraternity
]‘houses at Pitt are homes built

around the turn of the century and '

, because, many are antiquated be-

 yond financially feasible renova-
 tions,'the study considered ‘three

Renovations of individual houses
were considered and rejected as
too expensive. Townhouses feel
under the same knife. The third
alternative considered and the
one Lubits recommended for con-
sideration was a high rise struc-
ture.

The proposed sight for the
building was adjoining lots on
Bayard, Dithridge and Bellefield
Sts. which the University present-
ly owns.‘ The high rise was the
least expensive of the alternatives
and is considered easily adapt-
able to all types of housing ar-
rangements, or even convertible
into classrooms or offices.

The high rise plan would be an

innovation in student housing. Un- _

like the proposed Hillside dormi-
tories which would be standard
one, two or three~bedroom varie-
ty, the nine-story complex will
devote four f'loors to each of eight
fraternities.

The upper floors would be sleep-
ing-study rooms, the lower floors
communal living, dining and rec-
reation areas. The high rise would
also offer parking facilities and

5% 'New Santana’  

snakebitten disc

"by ‘WILLIAM M. SMITH

The Hooded King of Serpentine Guitarists has once again uncoiled
himself long enough to offer us another sample of his Latin sensuality.

I’m speaking of none other than Carlos Santana. who has a new
Columbia album entitled (what else?). The New Santana "Album

(shrug).

Oddly enough. the lasting appeal of this album lies in the artwork

on the jacket. They’ve transcended the Demian look of their last cover,

and cosmically captured an encompassing concept of the metaphysical
juxtaposition of man, his religion, and the universe through a strikingly

beautiful correlation of fantastic symbolic images. ,
But what of the music inside? In a word, disappointing!

One can be tolerant of repetition in style, and even cry out for more
if each time there is some new spark to keep the flame of interest burn-

ing. But this time the venom sacs of the_Reptile _.\/lan’s imagin

It is one thing to repeat yourself, and, of course, we all know that

there is nothing new to that. Our music, our fashions, our life styles,
and our very personalities are made of what we perceive and have ex-
perienced. What gives our creations a seemingly unique quality is that
small facet of individuality that sometimes shows itself in a select few.

Regular custoners of the Pitts-
burgh Playhouseare noticing the
many changes made to the inter-

‘ior of‘ the‘ Craft Avenue Theatre

this season. The Playhouse re-
cently underwent its second ren-
ovation since being converted

- from a syna-
gogue to a the-

practical. The theatre floor, for
example, has been raised 14 inch-
es in the rear and ‘given a more

suitable rake, and seats have been ‘

staggered so that none are direct-
ly behind any other, thus facili-
tating better -viewing for the au-
dience. '

the dome of the theatre have been
opened up, and wiring run through
rather than letting a tangle of
wires hang above the stage.

- In addition, 500 new seats have
:been installed in the theatre and
everything has been repainted.
The lobby andthe Lillian Russell
room of the Playhouse restaurant

be overcome before a production

Until last weekends Holy Cross game, the Syracuse foot-
ball team was not doing things that are expected of a typical
Orangeman squad. The team was not running the ball as much
as in previous years, the offense wasn’t scoring regularly, and
consequently the club was not winning with any degree of au-
thority.

“In fact, this season marked the first time that a Syracuse
grid squad did not win either of its first two home games since
Coach Ben Schwartzwalder’s era began in 1949. The opener
against Wisconsin ended in a 20-20 tie, while Penn State. ruined
SU’s homecoming by a 31-0 score. I

Before the season started, Syracuse was considered a chal-
lenger to the Nittany Lions for the Lambert Trophy, though with

the campaign half gone now, the team has hardly approached ’

that goal.

Of the three victories in the Or'ange’s 3-2-1 record, two
were by a one touchdown margin. Considering that these wins
were over Indiana, one of the weaker Big Ten clubs, and Mary-

cuse fans must have begun to worry.

Schwartzwalder, in his 23rd year
as head coach at Syracuse, must have
also begun to worry about his punch-
less offense. He started a new quar-
terback and two new running backs.
The result was the 63-21 demolition of
Holy Cross.

SU Sports. Information‘ Director

  

QB’s performance, “Frank Rulggerio,
starting his firstgame as a senior, gave
the team. the lift they needed—he gave
‘the offense a, spark.” " _
Unfortunately for Coach Carl DePasqua and the Pitt Pan-
thers, Schwartzwalder had the opportunity to experiment with

too much trouble," headmitted over the ‘phone at the Panther.

’ luncheon this week. Despite last'week’.s touchdown outburst
from his team, Schwartzwalder still shows concern over that

aspectof his squad. .

Injuries, which have plagued the Panthers in cycles this

‘fall, have also substantially hindered the Orangemen. Schwartz-
walder listed five key players on his team before the first game
who he knew must stay healthy if the Orange were going to be
tough. " '- " 7‘

Presently, four of the five are hurt and only two of the in-

I jured are questionable starters for Saturday’s game with Pitt.

Joe Ehrmann, rated a" strong choice for All-American honors
at defensive tackle, barely got the chance to prove himself. A
knee injury in the first game will keep him on the sidelines for

Without Ehr nann, the surprising-
ly small SU defense (their biggest de-
fender weighs only 225 pounds), has
still pleased Schwartzwalder.

Though Schwartzwalder has" en-
joyed 21 consecutive winning seasons
'. directing the Orangemen, he realizes
that his streak may be broken if his
squad can’t repeat last week's show-
ing.» “It sure can be a losing season,"
he stated. "We’ve got five games to
play and we could very easily lose all
five of them."

At this point of the season, worrying about an overall ‘los-
_ ing record is irrelevant as far as the Pitt Panthers and Carl De-
P-asqua‘ are ‘concerned. A losing record seems inevitable unless
the Cats can pull off at least two major upsets besides winnin
this one and the Army contest, which see ms unlikely. ’

V The present problem for the squad is to alleviate mistakes.
Although they have out first-downed all opponents and clearly
outgained them, fumbles and interceptions have undermined the

, effectiveness of the team.

Just as West Virginia hadsomething to remember from
last year about Pitt, so do the Panthers about the Orange. When

    Cat   full-hous e 
gives Medwid QBJ

’ _ by MARK SIG .v1oN

On’ a warm. hazy Saturday, October 23. at Boston College's
Alumni Stadium, many football fans in attendance were surprised
to see Pitt’s number eight trot out onto the gridiron after the open-
ing kickoff. One minute and forty-five _seconds later. the Panthers
led, 7-0, with QB Bob Medwid (number -eight) a large contributing

factor.

A former All-state and Big 33 standout while handling the sig-

nal calling at Sto-Box High
School, Medwid performed al-
most flawlessly in his initial
start as Pitt’s quarterback. He
completed seven of ten passes,
good for 101 yards. Even more
important, despite having thrown
four interceptions in five pre-
vious contests, Bob had none re-
corded. against the Golden
Eagles.

Crucial mistakes have haunted
the Panthers throughout the sea-
son. Two key fumbles against
Boston College, by John Chat-
man and Joel Klimek, indirectly
resulted in two BC touchdowns,
although in both cases, Coach
Carl DePasqua thought there
were late whistles.

“It’s all a matter of execution.

Fumbles and interceptions have‘

killed us all season. I know we

one of the teams left on our
schedule.” ' ~ ' ‘ _

Delighted over making -his
first varsity start at quarter-

utes before game time. We had

Senior lineman Chucho Valencia is a soccer
player of long standing.

I've been playing soccer since I could stand
-on my feet." said Valencia. "Soccer is the most
popular sport in South America and all the kids
play from the time they are small."

The Balmira. Colombia native came to the
United States in 1966 and resides with the Wil-
liam Bonesteel family.

"I met an American friend (Bonesteel). who
was working for the Peace Corps in Colombia."
- he related. "He met my family and I met his
family. Then they-invited me to come and live
. with them in America and study.”

M ' In leaving South America to live in the U.S.,
. Valencia did not leave behind his desire to play
soccer.

In this transition he has found that soccer
played in South America is slightly different
than American soccer.

"American soccer is very much based on phy-
sical endurance.) running mostly." commented
Valencia. "Latin American soccer is based on
skill—’to be able to handle'the ball. to be able to
. I do many things with the ball. I think both ways
' are effective."

Valencia has had some difficulties in adjusting
to the two different soccer techniques.

"I've had to ‘adjust to the two ways of play-
ing," he said. “When I first came I used to hold
’ the ball a little too long and I was told _to start
’ running more."

.The Pitt booter. however. has been able to turn
_ the difficulties into advantages.

,“I take advantage of playing both ways,” said
the Colombian- “It’s good to know who you're
playing with. Gus (Theofilos) can play in the
European style or the Latin American style and I
can understand his moves.

“In _the same way I can change the way of
playing with Joe Luxbacher, or John White who

use more the American way of playing." '

' Valencia feels thatthe Pitt soccer squad has
. - performed well so far this season.

“The team has done very well,” he said. “We
really haven’t had any breaks this season. If we
had we could have won against Akron and Clevel-
land State and could easily be 7-1-0 right now.

"I‘m pretty pleased with the team’s perform-
ance. If we keep on playing the way we have—
hustling and trying our best- we should be
recognized in the end. “

.Valencia also feels‘ that there has been some
improvement in his ownperformance.

“I’m playing more consistently this season,”
he said.“Last year I had some downfalls and some-
times I played good. But there are many things
that I could-do better—there’s always room for im-
provement.”

There is always room for improvement but in

.Chuclio Valencia's case. it is ‘standing room only.

but rich in experience

The Pitt Hockey Club, pre-
sently a member _of the West-
ern Pennsylvania Inter-Collegi-
ate Club Hockey Association
has released its schedule for
the 1971-72 campaign.- b

With its opener set for No-
vember 5 at Gannon College in
Erie, the squad has begun to
intensify its‘ preparation. Lim-
ited to two practices a week due
to lack of funds and facilities,
the club has concentrated. on
inter-squad scrimmages and prac-
ticing fundamentals. '

The icers have just received
$500 from the Allocations Com-
mittee and have asked for $6,000
more. One third of this second
allocation would go toward rent-

-.ing busses designed to transport

students to and from the games.
Since the‘ skaters play their
home games at the Alpine Ice
Chalet in Braddock Hills, trans-
portation is definitely a problem.

Even with this handicap,
though, the Ice Hockey team
managed to draw substantial

crowds last year in its maiden
season

.According to veteran goalie
Mark Lieberman. “We've bought
two full sets of goalie, equip-
ment with half the money we
received from allocations". We
can’t do anything with whatwe
have left until we get more."

Fans who don’t manage to get
out to Braddock Hills for the
November 7 home opener against
Duquesne will have to wait
until November 20 when "the
skaters take on C-MU.

The entire schedule appears

 as follows : *

Sun.. Nov. 7—Duquesne at Pitt (Alpine)—

Sat., Nov. 20—Pitt at C-MU (Alpine)

Sun.. Dec. 5——Pitt at St. Vincent (Greens-

Baseball season has been over
for some time now, but the in-
tramural softball champion has
yet to be determined. Poor wea-

the playoff rounds, but the teams

The Charlie Browns moved into
the playoffs by winning the Grad-
Fac division by whipping the
Medicine Men, 7-3. They earned
the right to meet the winner of
the Independent-Club victory;

Three games will be necessary
to determine the outcome of the
Ind-Club division. The Buzzards
willlface the Zips, with the win-

team surviving those matchups
goes against the Commuters. the
Club winner.

Midnight Hour, the not-"m

Fate has a funny way of bringing things to a climax.
Take the case of Mike and Bob Schurko. two of P1tt's
talented cross country and track stars.
When Schurko was a sixth grader in a Bethel elemen-

tary school,‘ his brother. Mike. was developing as the best ’

runner in Bethel High School history. Because they were
brothers and because little brothers have a tendency to
make idols of their big brothers, Bob Schurko decided that
he also would like to pursue a running career.

The Schurkos, through this period, were very close.
They have been running together for a long time. Aside
from their varied outlooks of life itself, they bear similar-
ities that only fate could arrange.

"When I left Bethel." Mike Schurko said. "I was
convinced that no one could beat me with the exception of
Jerry Richey. He was better than me, but I trained very
hard to make up for it. ’

SENIOR MIKE SCHURKO sets the pace for his brother Bob
both in cross country and in life. The ‘siblings have greatly
enhanced Coach Jim Banner’s harrier squad.

Photo by Matis

“At Bethel. l was Bob's hero. He copied me. Well
anyway, that‘s the way psychology books explain It. I
never directly encouraged him to run. He just did it. "

If you think you detect a little conceit in Mike’s voice,
forget it. Mike speaks as he sees it, but he is not conceited.

tlike Schurko is indeed a different type of person. He’

has a, very solemn and realistic view of life and. despite
his wiry and small body frame, :you do not cross .\like
Schurko and get away with it.

tlike takes his running seriously and. as an athlete.
he feels that only the hardest working ones are a success.
In the end he believes that only the fittest will survive.

“Running is the only thing I’ve done as far as creativ-
ity goes,” Mike continued.“The great athletes are only as
great as the amount of work they do. I take running more
seriously than Bob, but I am a hard worker and so is he.” _

Admittedly, Bob Schurko doesn‘t take running as
serious as his brother. Bob has a .nore casual outlook to-
wards life and has more means available to express his
creativity.

Aside from being a hard worker and a good runner.
Bob is also talented in other fields. He plays rock on the
guitar and was in a group for a while. Also. Bob saw
limited action both on the stage_and as a politician, in high
school. A ‘

“When I use to watch him /(Mike) in high school, I
decided that running was an interesting sport. As an ath-
lete; your social life is very important. Now, I don’t look
at running as a sport, I look at it as part of what I do.”

At Bethel, while his brother was having his problems
at Penn State before he transferred to Pitt, Bob did some
heroism of his own. His achievements were to become the
best cross country and track performen
course, his brother. Bob faced stiffer competition at Beth-
el than his brother, but injuries hindered him throughout
his eligibility.

On one occasion, however, Bob did surpass brother
Mike.

“Mike held the record in the mile, half mile, and in
the two mile,” remembered Bob, “They (Bethel) had all
the records listed on a wall. For the mile, half mile, and
two mile, the board read: M. Schurko. M. Schurko. M.
Schurko. All they had to do to change the wall was replace
the M with a B and switch 1:55.4 to 1 :54.5.”

Both Bob and Mike had pre-college heroes, aside
from one another in their tenures at Bethel High.

Joe Lodge coached both the Schurkos and to this day
has an influence on the runners'evaluation of a coach.

The feature concentrated almost primarily on the drinking
habits of Pitt's senior tackle. _It went into great detail exposing
incidents in Los Angelas, West Virginia, and New Orleans con-
cerning Broadheads escapades in certain bars and restaurants
in those areas. What it had to do with Broadheads athletic abil-
ity is very difficult for me to assess. '

As a result of breaking training rules andpublicly admit-
ting it, Broadhead was temporarily suspended prior to the 1Bos- - _
ton__.College game. The veteran tackle did see action in the game
though, when Coach DePasqua found that he had noone else to -*'~
to early _in the contest. Disciplinary action is not a new thing in
the realm of college football. ’

’ “Broadhead admits to being a problem with drinking," De- ’
Pasqua said. "It's a problem that he should have recognized
that would put him in an unhealthy situation. Admitting to this
publicly, having it written and being quoted on it-—he's old

“I can never prevent him as a coach, from drinking. He
knows from that aspect that we do not condone it. "

But the fire that has been ignited around the issue of Broad-I
head’s dri-nking appears to be very much out of proportion to y
the problem. Inthe process of exposing such a situation many "
other implications are made. most ofthem about the quality of
of Pitts football program _and the rigidity with which regula-

~ DePasqua would be very content to let the matter drop. It

is an unfortunate thing that some writers prey on sensational- .
ism to sell papers. Whether or not there should be any compul-
sion to keep things in perspective, to report what is relevant to_

_ an area rather than exploit a person’s personal life is a matter
that theethics of freedom~of’the‘ press. must answer. But the
effectsof such sensationalism are far reaching.

“I'd appreciate it if the issue was dropped,” said DePas- ‘
qua. “I don't think that any disciplinary measures is that much
of a news item.’ I do think that because of it and it was written
in the paper. it is ‘of interest to a recruiting programi’ '

. Perspective is an important thingin this Inatter.- How sig-
nificant Br-oadhead’s drinking is, is questionable. DePasqua I
' maintains thatthe problem had not been brought to his attention '
nor to anyone elsesfor that matter before the article. Beyond
that, it seems that Broadheads drinking has-very little bearing
on his prowess as a football player and its exploitation as sen-
. sationalism is a sad way to sell papers. I
