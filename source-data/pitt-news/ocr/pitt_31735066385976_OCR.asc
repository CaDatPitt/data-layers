the former director of research

A Cantekin, who was found guilty
of research misconduct stemming
from a 1986 conﬂict in which he

that I would move [out of the

office, the movers said they were
told to move it as quick as
possible.”

Officials at Children’s Hospital

had their offices moved because
of remodeling. Cantekin claims
that he is the only doctor who

Awareness of gay
rights bill promoted

For two years the students at a
Kansas university harassed him.
They loosened the bolts on the
tires of his car, spray—painted
“faggot” on his door and would
wait outside to beat him up when
he left his job at the library late at
night.

“I have heard some horrible
stories about hate-motivated
crimes against lesbians and gay
men, but I will never forget the
story of that man. This was one of
the worst I have heard,” said
Paula Ettelbrick, director of the
Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, a non-profit,
public—interest national group that
works for lesbian and gay civil
rights.

Ettelbrick told the story to a
crowd at a workshop titled “The
Gay Rights Ordinance: How it
works, How to Use It” held at the
Pitt Law School’s courtroom last
week. The newly added

ordinance, passed in Pittsburgh
earlier this year, prohibits
discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation. Ettelbrick
shared several examples of
discrimination and harassment
against gays and lesbians with
the audience to illustrate the
problems that anti—discrimination
ordinances can halt.

“Many times we get calls from
people who are constantly getting
passed up for the same promotion
at work, who aren’t overtly being
discriminated against but who
know that the reason this is
happening is because of their
sexual orientation,” Ettelbrick
said. P

The discrimination also extends
to everyday interactions that gays
and lesbians might have with
local businesses and
organizations.

clubs offer family discounts and

prescribed widely to children with
ear infections.

Bluestone said he could not
comment because “the case is
currently under review by an
NIH peer-review panel of experts.
That report will conclude in
several weeks.”

If the outcome of all
investigations is favorable,
Cantekin would like to stay at Pitt
and, in his words, “clean up the
medical school.”

Cantekin believes that in
addition to a study conducted
through a National Institute of

conducted studies for the drug
companies which make
amoxicillin. Only the results that
showed lamoxicillinl favorably
were published.”

Cantekin resigned from his post
as director of research at
Children’s Hospital after he
disagreed with Bluestone’s
findings. He regards Bluestone’s
actions as “a dear conflict of
interests.”

The findings, Cantekin said,
“are public property because the
studies negative to amoxicillin
were funded with tax money.”

The issue of who has a right to
the results of this study is not the
only problem Cantekin found

the drug may actually cause some
negative side effects.

He says that he reported this to
the NEJM. The journal chose not
to publish his report after Pitt
of licials stated that Bluestone was
the only person “authorized” to
make such a report. It is on this
report that the charges against
Cantekin rest.

Because he has tenure,

' Cantekin has not been fired. He

has, however, been relieved rom
his duties as research director at

Summerlea Kashar/ The Pitt News

University urged to lead in environmental risk assessment

By Gretchen Haller
For T be Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh is
in a position to be a leader in the
newly emerging field of risk
communication, and was strongly
encouraged to do so by Bernard
Goldstein, keynote speaker at
the recent symposium, “Air
Quality and Environmental Risk:
Assessment and Management.”

“T ruism: Scientists do a lousy
job of explaining science,” said
Goldstein, “and when it comes
time to make decisions, policy
makers do a lousy job of

explaining what it is they need to
know.”

Goldstein is the professor and
chairman of the department -of
environmental and community
medicine at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School.

“Translating risk assessment is
a communication problem," he
said in his speech to corporate
managers, government and
academic professionals,
environmental specialists and a
few journalists. His task was to
show how to translate risk

assessment into risk management.

“The translation problem is:
how do you get across these to
different mind sets?” Goldstein
said. “How do you get from the
science and risk assessment to
the policy maker?”

The most difficult thing
Goldstein has to teach his medical
students, he said, is “when there
is enough information to make a
decision.”

“I’d be a lousy physician ifl
[had] to get all the information
possible before I took care of the
patient.”

On of

the question

communication, Goldstein
suggested, “The only way you're
going to be able to come to a way
of dealing with the
communication problem is to
have an institution that’s credible,
that’s able to provide information
in a way that everyone believes
it, and where members of the
press, Congress and the
community will accept the fact
that these people are speaking in
a way that’s reasonably
disinterested, that’s out of their
expertise.

“Pitt is a good example of what
can be done in that area.”

On the interface between
science and policy, he called risk
assessment “the best process I
think I’ve come across in terms of
getting people who are both
scientists and regulators to focus
on the same question.”

As for communication,
Goldstein said that translation is
often dependent upon who does
the communicating, and
suggested that “there might be a
lot of scientists who might be in
the middle” on an issue.

“Good, well-trained journalists

a family is often a married couple
with children. In cities where
gays and lesbians have legal
protection, these businesses will
often back down when you bring

up the violation right away-

because all they are after is your
business,” Ettelbrick said.
Ettelbrick explained that sexual-
orientation ordinances also
protect discrimination against

. heterosexuals.

“In New York we had a case
where three homosexual men
went to rent an apartment and
were denied. After a complaint
was filed, the landlady said that
the reason she didn’t rent to them
was because she thought they
were heterosexual and were
always going to be bringing up
girls and having parties. That is
still discrimination,” Ettelbrick
said.

“These examples, for whatever
they are worth, are just to show
all of thethings that an ordinance
like Pittsburgh’s can affect. I
believe that city ordinances have

a tremendous impact in
prohibiting discrimination.”

Pittsburgh is the largest city in
the last year to pass a gay-rights
ordinance, according to Ettelbrick.
Similar bills have been passed in
about 75 other cities so far. Only
two states, Wisconsin and
Massachusetts, have passed
statutes which prohibit sexual-
orientation discrimination.

Ettelbrick came to Pittsburgh at
the request of the Pittsburgh
Commission on Human Relations.
She praised the commission for
helping to pass the Pittsburgh
ordinance and for taking steps to
inform gays and lesbians of their
rights.

“I have not known of any other
commission that has taken the
initiative the way they did in
Pittsburgh," she said.

Byrd Brown, attorney for the
commission, was at the workshop
to explain the way the ordinance
will work for Pittsburgh’s gay
and lesbian community. Although
the commission is in charge of
evaluating complaints and

enforcing the ordinance, he
warned that the ordinance cannot
work by itself.

“Regardless of who is enforcing
or not enforcing this particular
ordinance, it will never be self-
executing. You can never let
down your vigilance,” Brown
said.

The commission specifically
enforces sexual—orientation
discrimination in employment,
public accommodation, housing
and police—community relations.

“[In practical terms] we think
that [discrimination in] public
accommodation is when you go
into a restaurant and you don't
get served, but that has been
broadened in the sense [to
include] any entity or any
economic organization that
serves the public. That would be
considered a public
accommodation,” Brown said.

Brown explained that the
commission has varying powers
in each of the categories of
discrimination.

“In the first three areas the

commission can pretty much: grant
a full remedy. We can require an
employer to reinstate you [or]

order back pay; we can file an’

injunction to open up public
accommodations, go into court
to force a landlord to rent, etc. In
the area of the police—community
relations the commission’s
powers are limited to
recommending,” he said.
However, Brown said that the
power of recommendation to the
police could still be useful.
“People might say, ‘Well, why
waste my time?’ Well, you waste
your time for good reasons. If we
rule that your rights are being
violated, then that might one day
have a cumulative effect. What
people have done is to use the
commission’s findings if they go
to court to prove that something
is happening,” he said.
Violations of the sexual-
orientation ordinance clause are
handled in the same way as similar
violations to other protected
classes. Complaints should be

Aimee Wolfinger
For The Pitt News

Poho.

It was the last of the great
childhood diseases. When people
hear that word today, what do
they think about?

Disease? Suffering? Death?
Probably not. Most 20—year—olds
think of something remote,
something that happened “a long
time ago.” But it wasn't so long
ago that Dr. JonaslSa1k’s vaccine
was experimentally administered
to school children.

Jane S. Smith’s book Patenting
theSun brings back the details of
polio and the vaccine. She gives
her readers an inside look at the
doctors, the March of Dimes, the
victims and their parents.

“I wanted to record the
complications and human
interests,” Smith said.

As a child, Smith was a polio
pioneer. She was one of the
children who received an
experimental vaccine for the
mysterious and often deadly
disease. At the time, Smith didn’t
completely comprehend the
disease or grasp the importance
of the Salk vaccine. But she did
understand fear.

“I think, children understand
fear and dying. Fear in itself is a
communicable disease,” she said.

Although polio never affected

1 Smith on a personal level, as. an
adult and a mother /she wanted to

find out what was truly going on.
“Two or three things were
coming together that brought the
event back to me as an important
issue. As a writer, I try to talk
about the major people‘ and the
perception of the event by
ordinary people,” said Smith.
“In the book, I jump from the
power players to the parents and
the children, the people at ground
level. I wanted to record the
complications and the huma
interest.” ‘
For over 40 years parents lived
with the fear that polio might
affect their child. They lived with
quarantined areas, road blocks
and extraordinary fear. And then
in 1954, Salk discovered a
miraculous vaccine. “A constant
terror was lifted off your
shoulder,” Smith said.
Before Smith began her

' research, she had to convince

herself and others that Patenting
the Sun was more than a story
about the conquest of polio.“Polio
is old news. It's not a question of
one disease but how things
happen on a big scale. Who pays?
Who is given the vaccine? Who
lines up the millions of school
children who are test subjects for
the new vaccine?" she said.
Although many may View polio
as a distant, horrifying disease,
records were available to Smith
in the archives of the March of
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.
Smith felt the greatest challenge

in finding research was gathering
information about ordinary
people and how polio affected
their lives. Fortunately, however,
many people were still alive and
eager to describe their
experiences. “It stirred a chord in
a lot of people. Polio was a very
big part of their lives that they
had forgotten,” said Smith.
Patenting the Sun is a book
about “big events.” Using polio,
Smith has written a book that
exempliﬁes to her readers “how
things come to pass and how we
deal with success. Unlike the end
of a fairy tale, real life often ends

in argument, ill feeling and

tragedy. How do you deal with a
generation that grows up without
disease? What is the psychological
effect on a national scale?” Smith
questioned.

According to Smith, Salk’s polio
vaccine was an “event that made
a lot of things happen.” Salk’s

vaccine was “big—time science.”

The vaccine was found 10~years
before the first space exploration.

“Salk opened up a new interest
in science. He was treated on the
same level as Charles Lindbergh:
People thought of him as a hero,”
she said. _

Smith said she always had an
interest in writing, but one factor
that piqued her desire was
teaching at Northwestern
University. She found that the
students didn’t have a strong
knowledge of social history.

“I was teaching university
students, and I realized that the
students had no clue of what life
was like 50 years ago,” she said.
“I found that I was explaining the
background of the novels I was
teaching.”

The emergence of AIDS is the.

most terrifying disease to affect
society today. As a parent, AIDS
was another . provocation for
Smith’s Patenting the Sun. She
says that like polio, in order to
find a cure for AIDS, there must
be a massive action and

determined commitment to

finding a solution.
In Smith’s view, this generation

,Author recalls sz'gnz_'fz'cance of Salk ’s polio vaccine

and the generation before must
come together to find the answers.
“I don’t know the answers, but
I can ask the questions. How did
we get where we are today? What
efforts made it happen?And what
can we do in the future?” asked
Smith. 0
Through Patenting the Sun,
Smith urges her readers to
contemplate the disease, the

vaccine and “the big guns as well '

as the people at ground level.”
She wants people to be able to
compare polio and the
circumstances surrounding it to
other “big events” in their
everyday lives.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, May S0, 1990

 

Pitt professor provides explanations about supernatural .

By Leslie Mcswain
For The Pitt News

Do you remember your past
life? Can you channel spirits?

If you answer yes to either of
these questions, you should talk
to Sarah Thomason.

Thomason, a linguistics
professor at Pitt, can evaluate the
speech patterns of someone who
has either been hypnotized and

. age—regressed to a previous life

or is channelling a spirit.

“Most entities will speak in these
un-American accents. And
sometimes they say where and
when they lived, and then a
linguist can look at the accent

and see if it is appropriate for the ‘

time and place,” said Thomason.

Thomason’s debugging method
is not completely foolproof;
however, the responses against
this method are somewhat weak.

“I’ve only seen one response. It
was in Psychology Today in

October, and said you don’t want
to take this too literally. You
don’t want to suppose that this is
areal person who lived in this
particular time and place even if
they say they lived in this time
and place. You want to think of
this as somebody who is out of
time and belongs to the ages
speaking ageless wisdom so there
would be no particular’ accent.
But that’s kind of pushing it,
don’tyou think?” said Thomason.

Thomason is very skeptical
when she evaluates these cases,
but she is not attacking anyone’s
religion or beliefs. She simply
evaluates the tapes that people
send to her and points out the
linguistic mistakes that are
present. '

When asked what her most
ridiculous case was, she said two
came to mind. “There was this
channelled entity who was
supposed to be from Scotland in
the 16th century. His name was

Matthew, and he said where he
was born. He said he was born in
Firth of Forth, and the Firth of
Forth is this body of water. He
thought it was a town.

“The other case was one of a
hypnotist’s age-regressed
subjects, and she claimed to have
been an Apache squaw in the
19th century named Chloe. She
gave the date she was born on,
and when asked how she knew
the date, she said the chief had
written it on her forehead.”

The squaw also could not even
speak Apache, but spoke in
broken English. -

Thomason feels that it is
important for there to be someone
who can prove some of these
people false. Many of these
channellers make money from
the people who believe them
and pay to listen to their
“wisdom.” Some of her cases,
however, are not people
deliberately faking for money,

such as in the hypnotist’s age-
regressed subjects.

Dr.
psychology professor at Pitt, was
asked for some possible‘ reasons
why a person may subconsciously
invent a past—life character. He
said there could be a couple of
reasons, such as latent fantasies
that a person may want to fulﬁll,
or a person may want to please
the doctor by inventing a past
life.

Moreland also mentioned a
possible explanation that was
based on a paper by Hazel Markus
in American Psychologist.

“People in psychology pay a
lot of attention to what people
really think of themselves, but
people also ought to study what
she refers to as possible selves,
which are mental images of the
kind of person you could turn
out to be under circumstances or
if you take different courses of
action.” With this idea, a person’s

Richard Moreland, a 1‘

past life could be a positive view
of what the person wants to be or
a negative view of a type of
personality the person wants to
avoid. '

Moreland, like Thomason, is
skeptical about a person’s ability
to be age—regressed to a previous
life, but he did not know which
reason was the most probable for
why a person would invent a
past life.

Thomason’s plans for the
summer are in Montana, where
she is helping to save a dying
Indian language by teaching it to
the children of the tribe.

She is teaching General
Linguistics and Historical
Linguistics in the fall, but she
does not include her cases in the
class. She does give guest lectures,
and she has published a few
articles in the Skeptical Enquirer,
the journal of the Committee for
the Scientific Investigation of
Claims of the Paranormal. .

To explain some problems that

Goldstein listed seven “ploys

Sixth: Set the research agenda.

of fumes. A gallon of gas does
not weigh 20 pounds; I mean,

doesn’t any of it burn?’ You’d

think some of the massof that

wouldn’t have more mass

A young boys wish...

Seven year old Craig Shergold is confined to a bed, the
victim of a cancerous brain tumor. Unlike most seven-
year-olds, Craig spends his days fighting for his life
instead of enjoying the precious, carefree days of youth.

Like some of the other unfortunate children in his life

-and death struggle, Craig was granted a "wish" by the

Children's Wish Foundation. He would like to be in the
Guiness Boole of World Records for receiving the greatest
amount of get well cards ever. i
Craig is going to need over one million cards to achieve
his wish, and we would encourge everyone to take the
opportunity to brighten the life of this special child. The
small amount of time and cost it takes to send Craig a card
is nothing compared to the difference it will make to a
boy. Send cards to: Craig Shergold, c/o Children's Wish
Foundation, 32 Perimeter Center East, Atlanta, GA 30346.

SDI: the aged animal
should heput to sleep

Should the Strategic Defense
Initiative be abolished? Should
the $4.5 billion targeted for SDI
be spent elsewhere?

Absolutely.

First, let’s examine the history
of SDI. In the late 1970s, fading
conﬁdence injimmy Carter and a
in Soviet
weaponry led to a renewed para-
noia toward the Soviet Union
reminiscent of the “Red Scare.”

This paranoia culminated in
Ronald’ Reagan’s “Star Wars”
speech of March 23, 1983: “Let
me share with you a vision of the
future which offers hope. It is
that we embark on a program to
counter the awesome Soviet
missile threat with measures that
are defensive.”

Since then, the United States

has spent roughly $24.3 billion
on SDI. What have we got to
show for it? Blueprints, scrap metal
and promises of a shield of secu-
rity that will never be. Yet Presi-
dent George Bush recently re-
quested an additional $4.5 billion
for the project.
_ Don’t give it to him. Funds
wasted on SDI could better serve
our nation’s interests if they were
spent on AIDS research, provid-
ing food, clothing and shelter to
the homeless and stau nchin g the
flow of illegal drugs.

Take, for example, America’s

homeless. Since 1980, federal
outlays for rent subsidies and
home—building programs for the
poor and elderly dropped from
$41 million to $10 million. Con-
sequently, the United States’
homeless population has multi-
plied tenfold.

For the homeless, SDI provides

Charles
Baker

the wrong kind of shield. Unfor-
tunately, there are those who
might argue that the homeless
and people who have died of
AIDS don’t vote or pay taxes. So
why give them the money tar-
geted for SDI? “Wouldn’t be
prudent.”

Another point to consider is
this: Perestroika and the reuniﬁ-
cation of Eastern Europe has, in
part, lessened the threat of a
nuclear exchange.

Whether the reasons are eco-
nomic, political or philosophical,
the climate between the East and
the West has changed. As a re-
sult, SDI should be de-empha-
sized, or abolished, for now. ’

Man's place in a Woman's world

Feminism is a concept, aphi-
losophy. By its nature, therefore,
it allows multiple interpretations
and degrees of understanding,
acceptance and participation. ,

Current events call for specula-
tion on the role of men in the
women’s movement. The situ-
ation at Mills College brings this
need to my attention.

The women at Mills or any

other women’s college are in-

deed separatists. I do,not fault
their thinking, though words like
“reverse-sexism” indicate to me
that many other people do.

I support these women in their
decision to be separatists. I under-
stand and agree with their logic.
They recognize the existence of
sexism’ and have selected an
environment where they will be
free of its presence.

Separatism need not be a male-
hating attitude. These women
aren’t harming men in any way
by choosing to separate them-
selves. Separatism, where women
are concerned, is more of a sex-
ism-hating attitude.

Let me make it clear that I'm
not suggesting only men are
calling this “reverse—sexism.” I

know some women are yelling‘?

the same thing, and just as loudly.

Terms like “reverse-sexism” are
faulty because they imply that
men and women are on an equal
footing to begin with. And that
Simply isn’t true. Women aren’t
universally afforded the same
opportunities as men in any social
arena. ‘

Thefact that separatism is being
interpreted this way — that use-

‘ less and abusive adjectives are

being used to describe it -—— sug-
gests to me a fundamental mis-
understanding.

When women unite to com-
plete a project of any sort, some-
thing positive is being accom-
plished. Women are demonstrat-
ing that they are, in fact, “equal”
— that they can achieve a goal
without relying on men.

Men haven’t the need to attain
this same sense of self-sufficiency
and accomplishment. They aren’t
living in a world where women

make most of the decisions and
have most of the money and
most of the power. In short, their
sex does not put them at a disad-
vantage.

But many of the advantages
that men have historically taken

66 Teach your children

that they have a

choice between

T onka trucks and
Barbie dolls... 99

 

Mindy
Boffemmyer

for granted are new to women.
Women as a group have reached
a point where demonstration of
the ability to make use of these
freedoms is crucial.

, It is disturbing to me that a
woman’s decision to attend a
college where cooperation rather

than competition is stressed has

been interpreted as an act against
men. It is, rather, an act for
women.

Does being a feminist mean
failing to recognize the existence
of decent men in this world? I
realize that there are people, many
women and men, who simply
care about other people. Thatis,
in fact, the reason I choose to
continue living.

But those humanitarian men
who recognize sexism as an ex-
isting societal evil are not doing
women any good by trying to
jump intothe forefront of the
women’s movement.

If women cannot display to
themselves and to the society in

-which they live an ability to ac-

complish on their own, what are
the accomplishments worth?
Those men who despise sex-
ism have decided to do so on the
basis of experiences other than
sexism. Though they have the

capacity to be offended by injus- I

tice, they do not have the capac-
ity to completely comprehend
this particular form of injustice,
by virtue of their own sex.
Women are the victims of
sexism. Women stand to benefit

by advancing themselves and

each other. This is why women

needto lead the women’s move- \,

ment. This is why a man’s place
in those things that women have
created is limited, if not non-
existent.

The fact that men cannot at-
tend women’s schools or head
women’s organizations is sepa-
ratism, not sexism. There is a dis-
tinct and important difference.
Women are forced to live in a
world where men hold most of
the high cards. Choosing not to
slip men another ace or two is
not sexism; it’s an issue of sur-
vival and common sense.

If a woman chooses to attend at
school or join an organization

where the cards are dealt fairly,
she should not be criticized for it.
Am 1 suggesting that society

‘should split in two— that women

should completely separate them-
selves from ‘men —- in the fight to
abolish sexism? No.

After a tremendous amount of
thought, I have a proposal for
those men who are outraged by
sexism.

Speak up.

Tell everyone who will listen

, just how offensive sexism is.

Teach your children that they
have a choice between Tonka

trucks and Barbie dolls,nursing I

and metaphysics.

And treat everyone you en-
counter, male or female, on the
job or in a bar, with the decency
and respect they deserve by vir-
tue of their being human.

While many expected the bad
blood between the Pirates and
Dodgers to heat up last night, the
only blows being dealt at Three
Rivers Stadium were thoseto the
Dodger pitching staff.

The Bucs rapped Lasorda's staff
for 10 hits, led by Don Slaught's
three hit evening en route to a 9-
5 win to take the second straight
game of the series.

Pirate starter Bob Patterson had
an impressive outing, going 6 1/
3 innings while giving up six hits
and three runs, striking out six
batters and walking none.

Patterson said modestly of his -

performance, "I was pretty
satisﬁed. I tried to concentrate on
each hitter and each pitch and
tried notlto get too far ahead of
myself."
Patterson appeared to be on
top of his game after the third
’ inning."I did feel a little bit stronger
andl think it's because I loosened
up a little bit more. You get a
chance to work on a lot of things

when you have that many
pitchers." he said.
The Bucs did their initial

damage in the bottom of the
"second. Bobby Bonilla reached
9 first base on an infield single. R.

J. Reynolds walked and moved to

third while Bonilla scored on
V Slaught's double.

Andy Van Slyke singled up the
middle, scoring Reynolds and
Slaught, and eventually scored
on Jose Lind's sacrifice ﬂy.

In the fifth, Gary Redus was
one of Fernando Valenzuela's six
walks, and moved to third on
Bonilla's ensuing double. Both
scored on Reynold's single to put
the Bucs up 6-0.

But the Dodgers finally

counterd in the seventh, sending,

10 men to the plate as they scored
five runs. Kal Daniels and Eddie

VM-urray singled. Daniels and

Muray scored on a Rick Dempsey
single and Dempsey scored after
Alfredo Griffin laid down a bunt
single ‘off reliever Stan Belinda.

Scott Ruskin came on with two
out in the seventh and gave. up a
double to Mickey Hatchet, scoring
Griffin and Lenny Harris. ‘

The Bucs then added a run in
the eighth and ninth.

Pirate managerjim Leyland was
quick to emphasize S1aught's role
in the win.

"lt's nice to have a guy the

quality of Don Slaught. Some
people criticized us and said we
gave up too much. Butwe needed
someone we felt had a chance to
hit a little bit more when Spanky
[LaValliere] went down."
Leyland was also quick to quell
the recent panic over the Bucs‘
recent losses. "We had a great
road trip and everyone wanted to

have a parade. Now those same .

people want to have a funeral.
This is a good club. It's not perfect.
We're going to have our slides
and slumps. But this is a good
club."

than one?

The Los Angeles Dodgers’
pitcher seemed well on his way
to improving his career record
against the Pirates to 5-1 Monday
afternoon after pitching eight
marvelous, one—hit innings.

What happened during those
eight innings, however caused
two Pirates to be ejected, two
drunks to wander onto the field,
and two major—1eague baseball
teams to be guilty "of scarring
their sport. R

The whole mess all started
when Pirate pitcher Bob Walk
plugged the Dodgers’ Hubie
Brooks with a pitch in the left
forearm and then Belcher
almost hit Don Slaught  and
then Randy Kramer almost hit
Belcher  and then Belcher hit
Slaught. You get the picture. Oh,
somewhere in there, the benches
cleared.

Of course the Dodgers say
that the Pirates were throwing at
them. Of course the Pirates say
the Dodgers were throwing at
them. And neither was throwing
at the other——— of course. ' ‘

But let’s go back to yesteryear
—July 24, 1989, to be precise —
when all this chicanery really
began. Tim Crews, an L.A. relief

 

pitcher, beaned Gary Redus, and
put Redus in the hospital. And of
course the Pirates said  well, it’s
in the previous paragraph.

Scene Two. May 1 of this year.
Dodger Stadium. Belcher knocks
Bobby Bonilla down, Kramer hits
Belcher. Benches clear. Simple
as that. Belcher won, 4-1.

After Monday's game, while
most Dodgers sat moping over a
disappointing loss, one Dodger
remained animated, standing in a
corner of an otherwise silent
locker room. Belcher.

“I’m gonna protect my
teammates. [The Pirates] got the
idea that I’m a headhunter here.
If that’s what they think, well,
they’re wrong.” Of course.

Unfortunately this is not a rare
incident these days. Only the day
before, Greg A. and/ or W. Harris
of the Padres drilled the Mets’
Kevin Elster, who’s practically
batting his belt size, square in the
back. Now Harris and Elster

(:0

probably never even knew the 

other existed until that at-bat, yet
Elsterfelt the pitch was a malicious
attempt to injure him, so he
charged the mound.

The sport can’t afford to be
worrying about petty feuds
between two teams, but yet that’s
what it has had to do.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May 30, 1990

 

Simonds

Continued from page 6

A: That’s a lie. Jim Valvano never
was and never will be a players’
coach. He only coaches for
himself. As far as his own players,
he was distant; numerous times
players made appointments to
see him, and V never showed up.
He made all these promises to
players about how he would
always be there for them, and the
next year he was out recruiting
someone to fill that kid’s spot.
Q: Do you think NCSU got let
off easy last year when it was
placed on probation?

A: Dealing with the NCAA
throughout the book really turned
me off to them. The organization
is so crooked and lost, they
couldn’t find Texas on a map if
you put a pin on the state. How
the heck are you ever going to
find any type of information if
people don’t want to say anything?
What big school is going to want
to say, “This is what we did
wrong.” They will never do it. It’s
the small schools like Robert
Morris that unveil a problem, and
the NCAA decides that they are
going to take a stand. It’s a joke.
The honest schools get slammed,
and the crooked guys are laughing
all the way to the bank.

‘force behind college

annal

basketball?

A: Money. There is just too much
money being distributed among
just the big schools. Consequently,
the need to win becomes much
greater, and the stakes are then
raised. That gets passed down to
the coach, and he takes it as far as
possible. If one coach cheats,
you can bet almost all follow suit.
It boils down to this, “Win or get
fired.” In today’s game it is very
hard to win honestly.

Q: How many “totally” clean
programs do you think exist?
A: None. With the NCAA’s
rulebook, it’s like trying to read a
dead language. The question is
how many schools breach rules
unintentionally, and the answer
to that is very few.

Q: How do you feel when you
watch N .C. State play? .

A: I like to see them win, and I
will really like to see them win
now that Coach lValvanol isn’t
there. It’s unfortunate that kids
had to suffer because of a coach’s
actions. When I watched a game
while V was there, I couldn’t help
but want the allegations to come
to the surface and V to get out of
there. I think State has now turned
over a new leaf; I really hope
they do well.

Q: How have the former
players reacted to the whole

situation?

A: The players I have talked to
have responded positively to me;
however, they can’t really say
anything because of the players’
code, which says you can’t speak
badly about the school or coach
you played for, but most of them
are happy that the truth was
finally brought out.

Q: How much power did V
actually have?

A: He was more powerful than
the chancellor. People got to see
that when the chancellor got fired
over a basketball situation months
before the coach did. How do
you explain that’ When the
program was out of control, why
not fire the coach/ athletic director?
It’s because people thought V
was untouchable, and V made
people think he was. He was a
professional manipulator.

Q: What can we expect from V
in the future?

A: I’m sure that you’ll see him
back, telling jokes, [mimicking]
his wife and kids, getting cheap
laughs. He’s good with people,
but it would be a real shame if he
got back in coaching. But, if he is
going to, he should stay off the
college level. Let him go to the

pros. When people think of the
NBA, they think of Jordan, Bird
and Magic. When people thought
of N.C. State they thought of
Valvano; he will just be a little
fish in a big pond then.

Q: How prominent are drugs
among college athletes?

A: I think lthey’rel fairly prominent
in that not everybody on every
team is a user. There are actually
a few stars in today’s game that
are addicts, and there are users
on almost every team, and if
someone tells you differently,
then they are lying. I saw it
frequently at N.C. State, and it
was more visible among the star
athletes.

Q: What is the status of the
current point-shaving
investigation?

A: As far as the overall status, that
would be hard for me to say, but
as far as myself, the attorney
general of New Jersey is going to
come visit me soon. Also the
Organized Crime Bureau has
subpoenaed me to appear before
a jury to inform ‘them of everything
I saw concerning point-shaving
and things said in the book.

Brawl ——

Continued from page 6
player’s bubble gum card says he

is, he’s a boy at heart. He has to
be in order to play this game.

So what do you do? Well, if
they want to act like children,
then treat them as such. Punish
them.

How about automatically
throwing out anyone who leaves
the dugout or the bullpen to
“protect his teammates.” Hockey
has it. Basketball has it. Baseball
needs it. I wonder if Belcher or
Slau ght or Harris or Elster wonder
how stupid they look with their
childish game of “Well, he hit me
first.”

Now the players will ramble
on about how their lives are in
danger every time they step into
the batter’s box, and how they
need to make a stand to protect
themselves.

That’s all fine and dandy, but
there are more intelligentways to
handle the situation. First of all,
what every manager and player
tells you is true. Their teams do
not throw at players intentionally.
Anyone who thinks otherwise is
wrong. Case closed. But, the
managers will say that they tell
their pitchers to throw inside, but
just enough to back the batter off
of home plate. Occasionally one
slips a little too close, but, come
on, even pitchers are human. All
it takes is one close pitch,
interpreted as a response to an
earlier brushback, to have two
teams turn into the Hatﬁelds and
the McCoys. After a while, they

- forget how it even started, but the
feud continues.

As soon as batters realize that
they're not targets of assassins,
this nonsense will stop. When
will that be? Let’s see, how many
years did it take to realize that
communism didn’t work? Perhaps
the only solace is that this is a
recent trend, with the emphasis
on trend, and that it will
(hopefully) revert back to the
way it used to be.

Up until the ‘70s, knockdown
pitchers were common, but
basebrawls were rare. Don
Drysdale cleared a path to the
Hall of Fame with his inside
pitches for the Dodgers during
the ’60s. Drysdale was in the park
Monday, broadcasting the game
back to Los Angeles. I would love
to know what Big D thought of
yesterday’s incident.

Here’s hoping he’d want to
give ‘em all a high, hard one.

Young Company performs Shakeseare's Merry Wives

Mindy Boffemmyer
Contributing Editor

Take an oblivious and easily
ojfended French man, a well—bred
gentleman with a seedy past and
‘a lanky, high-strung kid —— all
competing for the same fair
maiden,-

A plump and boorish libido
with legs,-

A couple of ﬂ¢n—loving —- but
oh, so honest-—— Windsor wives;

An insanely jealous husband;

A brazen bully-girl;

Add a toast;

Set your blender on puree;

Now sip The Merry Wives of
Windsor —— Young Company
style.

The Young Company, a group
of graduate and undergraduate
Pitt theatre students, mixes up a
tangy, completely fresh version
of the Shakespearian classic --
all on their own.

The Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival opened a second stage
at City Theatre to feature this
new attraction for its 11th season.

The fact that this company is
young may be the reason the
production is so distinctly
enthusiastic and accessible. The
actorsseem to have a great time
with’ it’:

It is rumored that Shakespeare
wrote TheMerry Wives of Windsor
at the request of Queen Elizabeth,
who wanted to see the character
John Falstaff (from Henry IV) fall
in love.

But Falstaff is driven more by
lust than love, attempting to
seduce twq women at once. The
play focuses on the women who,
wise to Falstaffs motives, plot to
ensnare him.

Characterization is The Young
Company’s biggest contribution
to the play. The performers are so
immersed in their characters that,
as ‘an audience member, you have
to fight to keep from believing
them.

Kenneth Roberts is perfectly
lusty and selﬁsh as Sirjohn Falstaff.
Carrying his girth andwhisllid is a
visibly strenuous labor.

Jenny Noa (Mistress Meg Page)
and Patricia Grace Miles (Mistress
Alice Ford) are the scheming,
merry Cbut honest) wives of
Windsor who trap Falstaff in his
own treachery. As an audience
member, you feel like an
accomplice in their pranks

because the _ pleasure -they derive V

is so natural. _

Michael Dowd artfully displays
comedic gesturing as Alice’s
jealous husband, Master Frank
Ford.

Derek Walton plays a comical
but pretty together Master George
Page. His facial expressions and
timing give thecharacter more of
a ' sense of humor than
Shakespeare gives him in the
script.

 Grace Miles, Jenny Noa and Kenneth Roberts in Merry Wives of Windsor.

Colleen O’Conner (Nyrn) is a»
girl with a gun —— except she
carries a knife. Her interpretation
makes a« minor character very
memorable.

Anne Louise Bannon is hilarious
as the servant ‘Mistress Quickly.

She’s too busy talking, plotting
and coming on to men to breathe.
Saaed Sayrafiezadeh generates
a lot of laughs as an exceedingly
nervous and distracted Slender.

New Fugazi album repeats earlier success

Fugazi I
Repeater/Margin Walker
Dischord

From the outset of his career,
Ian MacKaye has been an
innovator, probably best known
for forging the straight—edge
movement with D.C.—based Minor

Threat.

With his most recent project,
fans and critics knew he had
forged into new territory once
again. MacKaye has redirected
his early, aggressive punk attitudes
into an intelligent musical
expression known as Fugazi.

Along with Joe Lally (bass),

Brendan Canty (drums) and Guy
Picciotto (vocals), MacKaye has
opened the ears and minds of
young and old alternative music
fans.

Repeater is the band’s third
release in less than a year. Fugazi
put them on the scene, and 1989’s
Margin Walker set their musical

A downside up look at Ian and Fugazi.

. prowess

in cement. Margin
Walker is included on the
compact—disc version of Repeater.

Fugazi’s music falls somewhere
between outright preaching and
mindless fun. The group has
found a middle ground for its
rhetoric, managing to make even

the most disturbing ‘social
dilemma palatable.

The band has masked heaps of
social consciousness behind a

hard-driving, at times melodic, ’

musical style. Fourteen-year—old
punk rockers enthralled with the
band because of MacKaye’s
legendary past, Minor Threat is
getting more than it realize.

While they’re concerned with
their latest tattoos and with
keeping their mohawks up,
Fugazi slips them doses of more
focused issues. Environmental
decay, rape, death and basic
human interactions are just a few
of the topics Fugazi touches on
with thought—provoking lyrics
and gut—1evel sounds. ’

The lyrics can be a bit vague at

times, but the messages are there‘

if you’re interested. “The world is
not our facility/We have . a
responsibility/To use all our
abilities/To keep this place alive.”
Not a direct pronouncement, but
you get the idea.

MacKaye (founder/guitarist)
commands amazing amounts of
respect for a 95—pound vegetarian
(not to be confused with a 95-
pound weakling). His mild-
mannered voice paciﬁes the
rowdiest crowds, allowing
Fugazi’s message to be more
easily absorbed.

Repeater compounds Fugazi’s
brutal awareness of the world it
lives in. The group is not afraid to
face reality and tell it like it is.
Facts precede personal opinions,
and MacKaye and his cohorts
want you to know that

Pitt profs novel a magic busride

I Get on the Bus
Reginald McKnight
Little, Brown

Evan Norris quits the peace
corps and takes a long, strange
trip on Reginald McKnight’s magic
bus.

Evan didn't have a strong self-

, concept when he was living in

suburban America with his
girlfriend, his middle—class, black
family and his white, ex-hippie
friends. Now, during the course
of this surreal‘ bus ride, he can’t
distinguish reality from
hallucination.

He decides at first that he’s
losing his mind to malaria and
opts not to take quinine tablets
because _ he’s enjoying: the
hallucinations — ﬁnding himself

- suddenly on a hot bus crowded

with bizarre people.
Everyone Evan encounters in

Senegal has a different explanation
for his illness, and the only
common thread running through
their theories is that it’s
supernatural. There’s no way of
knowing who's telling the truth in
this novel until the very end — if
then.

While grappling with
hallucinations, blackouts, intense
headaches and starvation, due to
whatever it is that ails him, Evan
is also struggling with an identity
crisis. Nearly everyone he
encounters either tells him he
doesn’t know what it means to be
black or that he is not quite black
enough.

McKnight presents unbelievable
characters and situations and
makes themvividly and distinctly
real. The reader wonders, with
Evan, when he’s going to either
wake up or come down.

But the outstanding feature of
McKnight’s first novel is the
narrative voice. McKnight goes
through the necessary steps to
make his character “human”;
Evan drifts through the complete
emotional spectrum, trying to
figure out who he is and what
he’s doing here. His voice is .
confused, humorous, gullible
and occasionally nasty. He has
a real and honest personality.

I Get on the Bus is, above all
else, completely original.

I Get on the Bus is Reginald
McKnight’s first book since
Moustapha’s Eclipse, his award-
winning collection of short
stories which also deals with
experiences in Africa and
America. With this first novel,
he has made the wait
worthwhile.

dimension to the word “meek”

with her portrayal of ‘Simple,
Slender’s mindless servant.

‘ David Skeele is also hilarious
as Doctor Caius, the clueless
French physician who is the
unwitting victim of insults and
trickery. Jerry Scott is the funny

and money—motivated innkeeper

whose hobby it is to make an ass
out of Caius.

These actors and actresses are
so masterfully tuned in to their
characters that Shakespeare
himself would applaud The Young
Company’s performance of The
Merry Wives of Windsor.
