What had initially been antid-
pated as a troublesome, riotous
event, the fourth annual student-
run party called 'SempleFestproved
relatively -tame in comparison to
previous years. '

Instead of the Semple Street
free—for-all that occurredlast year,

' Pitt police, city police and the Li.-_

quor Control Board managed to
contain most of the partying to
individual porches, keeping resi-

dents, roofs, cars and couches safe '

throughout the day and into the
evening. . j '

On the ﬁnal day of classes for
Pitt, South Oakland students wel-
comed the nice weather by lining
porches and lawns to celebrate the

term’s end. But by 2 p.m., the road ~

on Semple Street. remained vacant,
besides the police officers. Students

were conﬁned to porches, where ‘I

individual homes were throwing
smaller—scale parties.’ Some, like
of-age Point Piarkistudent Gina
Pennline, were carded before being
admitted to parties or given a cup.

' “I feel SempleFest in my veins,”
said Pitt -student Austin Koontz.
“Everyone wants to connect it,to
a certain date or some Facebook

. group, or whatever construction

they want to give it. The core of
SempleFest is when it’s nice like
this, you have all these ﬁnals, I just
want to relieve all my tensions and
literally just enjoy myself with my
friends.” ' A
“I’m pretty sure that reciprocates
itself because that’s whai everyone

else ‘wants to do,” he said, “and.

that’s what ’SempleFest is: Some-

thing that started in a living room, 1

shoes on the telephone wire, glass
in the street, turned into something
amazing.” ’ . ‘
By 5 p.rn., the initial anxiety of
citations and police presence be-
gan to dissipate as keg after keg

Two candidates will contest

that becoming mayor would help

campaign, and he’s
hearing more and
more that people A

see prevention. They want to see

A opportunities for kids who know
people in the city so they don’t have _

to turn to  crime, violence and
guns,” he said. A
The first project Dowd wants to
tackle is budget appropriations. '
“Are we targeting our dollars. for

C the right public safety issues? Or ‘

are we mistargeting them?” he said,’
noting that the police officers have
a small amount of overtime relative
to ﬁreﬁghters. A

Dowd wants to deal with sewer

away. The citizens of Pittsburgh
voted in favor of the $400 million
sewer referendum last year.

“We can save ourselves millions,

and probably tens of milliops of O

dollars in the mandated reconstruc-
tion of our systems,” said Dowd.

While knocking on doors, Dowd

Pittsburgh among more stable places to Search for aob

by Lori Stover
‘Staff W/rite/'

~ One year ago, Pitt engineering
studentjames Eliou began to work
with the manufacturing company
Eaton, and his changes of securing
a job straight out of college looked
good.

As a “co—op” student, Eliou
alternates semesters between work-
ing for Eaton and taking classes at
Pitt. During his second semester
working there, the company’s stock
began to fall.

“At the beginning, they said it’s
great to buy stock in, but after my
second rotation, they were getting
screwed,” he said.

If everything goes well, “co-op”
students can typically expect a job
offer from the company at which
they work, Eliou said, but with the
recent recession, Eaton can’t give
him a deﬁnite answer. " '

But the job, prospect still looks
hopeful, he said. Like many Pitts-
burgh companies, Eaton hasn’t
been hit as hard as those  other
cities, and they hope to return to
hiring people by next spring.

THIS SATURDAY

In fact, graduating students
might find it easier in this economy
to get hired in Pittsburgh than in
many other cities, though some say
the competition for jobs willbe as
tight here as anyplace else.

Since the decline of the steel in—
dustry, Pittsburgh has been known
for "high unemployment, and gen-
erations of Pittsburghers have fol-
lowed the common wisdom that to
get a job, people should get out of
Pittsburgh.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics

_lists the unemployment in Pitts-

burgh through 1984 as constantly

more than 9 percent, while the,

national average remained below
8 percent each month.

But by 1999, Pittsburgh posted
an unemployment rate only slightly

- higher than that of the national av-

erage, and last February, Pittsburgh
posted an unemployment rate of
7.6 percent, just slightly below the
national average of 8.1 percent, the
bureau’s Web site says.

CMU Professor of Economics
Marvin Goodfriend said that with
the recent recession, the nation has

.‘-iliﬁl Ill .-*3 H.) l)R.!"~éK l’!{1li’l It in l€'fl)l;lR§ I!

experienced a contraction of em-
ployment across most industries.

“This is the worst recession in
the United States since World War
II,” he said.

Goodfriend-said that as of last,

month, the current recession has
lasted for 17 months and has sur-
passed the previous record for
longest recession since the Great

(6

Layoffs are still
outpacing new
, employment,
but we're doing ok.

Jim 
Futrell

Depression. '
These days,]im FutIell,ithe vice

president of market research at the

Allegheny Conference on Com-
munity Development, said that

—Pittsburgh has built up a stable

and relatively recession—resistant

economy that missed the full blow
of the banking crisis.

“Layoffs are still outpacing new
employment, but we’re doing ok,’_’
said Futrell. “We did not get caught
up in the boom.”

Those in the ﬁelds like ﬁnancial“

services and engineering shouldn’t

have much trouble ﬁnding a job in

Pittsburgh, he said.

PNC and Mellon banks mostly
avoided the losses that other banks
suffered, and Westinghouse has
been relatively unaffected, he said.
Also, natural gas companies have
actually expanded their exploration
in the area. '

Christopher Briem, of Pitt’s Cen-
ter for Social and Urban Research,
said Pittsburgh has maintained its
economy by staying out of the dot-

com boom of the late ‘90s and,’

more recently, the housing boom.

In both cases, Pittsburgh missed '

out on the growth and  bust.

PNC and Mellon avoided the
banking crisis by staying away from
predatory lending practices, which
led to defaults on mortgages across
the country, he said.

' Instead, more stable industries
such asihealthcare, education and
some technology-based industries
have slowly reshaped Pittsburgh.

Also, with the revival of the
nuclear industry, Westinghouse
Electric Company has experienced
an increase in business and a need

for employment, he said.

“A few wins like that, and you
get the stability you need,” said
Briem. »

Because of Westinghouse and
similar companies, engineers like
Eliou have continued to find jobs
in the region, he said.

But Briem added that the city
shouldn’t worry about keeping peo-
ple around, because most people in
Pittsburgh have lived here all their
lives. He said Pittsburgh should
work to attract international tal-
ent that will help develop new
industry. '

“There was a period of time
when people really were leaving,
but that has stopped,” he said.

Cheryl Finlay, director of Pitt’s
Office of Student Employment

and Placement Assistance, said

Police believe that one man is responsible
for the three recent Oakland bank robberies,
a Pittsburgh police sergeant said.

While the descriptions given of the sus-
pect in_each of the robberies didn’t match
up perfectly, city police Sgt, Lavonnie Bick-

erstaff said police believe the same man I

committed all three crimes based on other
evidence gathered during the investigation.

Bickerstaff would not release informa-
tion about this evidence or comment fur-
ther on progress police have made in the
investigation. I

April 20, 2009

The April 14 and Feb. 24 robberies both
occurred at Parkvale Bank at 3520 Forbes
Ave. A third robbery occurred at National

City Bank at 3700 Fifth Ave., on April 8, pi
‘ she said. -

In each of the robberies, a man made

‘verbal threats to the bank teller, but no one

reported seeing a weapon, she said. ‘

Witnesses in each case described the
suspect as a black man, but the height'de—
scribed varies betweenincidents. Bickerstaff
said people often misjudge height based on
their own height. For example, taller people
tend to describe people of average height as
shorter than they actually are.

Overtime police force
returns, citations A )ump

by Lori Stover
Staff Writer

The Impact Overtime Detail has returned
to the streets of Oakland, andwithit, aspikein
citations.

Pitt police chief Tim Delaney said that when
Pitt went on winter break, police temporarily dis-
banded the  because the cold weather and
absence of students led to less trouble

 means anin-
creaseinsmallcrimes,Delaney.Onawarmnight,
partiers lend to ignore open container laws, step
off their front porches and ﬁnd themselves in
trouble more often. .

The  consists of both city and Pitt
police,havebeentogetheragainsinceMarch for
patrol each Thursday, Friday and Saturday night,
causing a jump in the number of citations

When police formed the squad at the 
of last semester, about ﬁve years after‘ the previous
squad disbanded, Delaney said he noticed an even
greater jump in citations ‘ ' ' A

“I believe it’s the most effective way of policing

the area,” he said “Being on foot a stro

presence in the area.” -

The  aims to increase the police pres-
ence in Oakland and to make Oakland residents
aware of the law so that the number of citations
eventually drops oﬂ: he said ';

“Our goal isn’t to cite people, our goal is to
stop the action,” he said.

Bywalkingthroueh the area regulaﬁyinstcad
of  by at 20 miles per hour, police connect
with the neighborhood, he said

Delaney said he  in the first 
thelatae ’80s andatthe time,heknewa]lof thelootl
business owners, club bouncers and residents.

By  in the squad, officers f‘get
 with surroundings and open up a line
of communication with the neighborhood,” he

‘said f

As a result, neighbors would learn to go out
and find the officers when an incident occurs,
and the police could more effectively  the

‘areasafe,hesai.d I p "“ _ A

Also, because the squad consists of oﬂicers
 overtime, it does not respond to emer-
gency calls, which provides aconstant presence
on the streets of Oakland , ,

Delaney added that because ‘many students
come ﬁom areas outside of Pittsburgh that may
have different ordinances, some ‘don’t  the

, exact laws they must follow concerning 
alcohol in public

The squad operates on a volunteer basis, de-
 on seniority and overtime  The
Pittsburgh police contribute three to four people,
and Pitt police match their number, he said

The atmosphere is a little tenser at the next

Energy drinks aren’t
regulated by the FDA

Caffeine, page 4

Pitt junior Aubrey Roos said she uses energy
drinks to stay focused when studying for ﬁnals,
but not in excess

“I dijnk them once or twice a week close to fi-
nals,” said the environmental studies major: “Some
people have them for breakfast”.

But Roos said that when it comes to her sugar-
free Rockstar Energy Drink, she buys the drink
because of its taurine and green tea extracts, not
for the caffeine rush. 1

Many energy drinks feature various blends
of herbal ingredients, such as Monster Energy’s
‘ ‘energy blend” and Full Throttle’s “Full Throttle
blend,’ ’ which both contain undisclosed amounts
of ginseng, taunne and guarana.

The effects and nutritional value of many such
herbal additives are unknown, said Larsen, because
most are not regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration. \

“People can claim that they do X, Y and Z,
and that’s_it,” she said. “They’re not regulated by
the FDA — not even a little bit”

A Larsen said that because some herbal supple-
ments are not monitored, energy drink borders are

not required to include potential  labels or
list the amounts of such additives on cans.

Despite the lack of FDA regulation, Larsen
said that energy drinks are no reason for concern.
For example, many contain ginseng, which works
in the same way as caffeine, and some include
B12 vitamins, which do not provide much of an
energy boost;

“It’s nothing so profound that we can say,
‘Stay away from these things,” she said. “I think
that most of them are mild. They seem to be
pretty safe.”

Senior Andrew Hryckowian, who was studying
with Houck at2 am. in the Cathedral of Learning,
said the energy boost far outweighs any 
health iisks associated with energy drinks

“The cans seem to say, ‘Buy this if you want
to stay awake!” said the microbiology major. “It
works out pretty well.” , ‘

Houck agreed.

I-ﬁler can of Amp Energywas still half full, but
she said she planned to finish it;

“I need it to stay awake and study,” she said.
“Otherwise, I’d be sleeping right now”

‘Eds and meds’ hel

Jobs, page 8
Pittsburgh has held strong during the eco-
nomic recession.

“Pittsburgh is thriving and surviving in A

some sectors,” said Finlay. “We’re going to
lose jobs just like some other places but not
by the same volume.”

The education and health care sectors,
the so—called “eds and meds” of Pittsburgh,
speciﬁcally have dodged most of the negative
effects, she said.

But the question still remains wheitheror
not graduating -studentswill want to stay in
Pittsburgh.

Twenty—one percent of graduates from
the class of 2008 have chosen to remain
in Pittsburgh and 38 percent have settled
somewhere inwestern Pennsylvania, Fin-
lay said a survey done by Student Affairs
concluded. '

Another survey of the current junior
class revealed an overwhelming preference
towards staying in Pennsylvania after gradu-
ation, said Finlay, but the survey didn’t break
the results down into smaller regions.

“Many students have been pretty restricted
as to where and for whom they want to
work,” said Finlay. “They have to come to
terms with the economic reality. “

Employers inside and outside Pittsburgh
have become more selective, she said. At a

One group, the Pittsburgh Regional Intern

 

p city survive the economy  

ship Collaborative Enterprise, has taken up
the mission of connecting high school and
college students with paid internships and
jobs speciﬁcally in the Pittsburgh region.

Melissa Price, who oversees the proj-
ect, said the group works directly with 10-
cal companies to match them up with job
candidates.

The program also holds presentations

about Pittsburgh, its neighborhoods and its
affordable living, she said.

“We try and get young people excited
about Pittsburgh and about staying in Pitts-
burgh,” she said.

Lately,_she said, the group ha_s noticed a
decrease in the number of companies will-
ing to pay students for an internship or to
hire inexperienced workers directly out of
school-

To combat this, she said, the group has
expanded its range of students it works with
from mostly ﬁnancial and business’ majors
to-students studying engineering and the
liberal arts. ' .

To ﬁnd a job in the area, Price said, stu-
dents should take advantage of their family
and community networks and explore every
opportunity.‘ _

“The jobs are out there,” she said. “You
just have to ﬁnd them.”

He said he used to stand outside the adddrop
room on the ground floor of Thackeray Hall and
dig through garbage cans during registration days.
He looked for discarded registration forms on
which students had written their Social Security
numbers And he had his paper shredder humming
to dispose of the papers properly.

The registrars office, which processes all regis-
trations in offices in Thackeray Hall, switched from

using Social Security numbers to the PeopleSoft ’

system in 2005.

\X71th PeopleSoft, all students, faculty and staff
are assigned University pin numbers that become
their official ID numbers at Pitt. ,

The University, like many across the country,
used to use Social Security numbers to .identify
students on class rosters and for submitting grades
Because payroll and financial aid forms still require
them, the registrar’s office still collects all students’
Social Security numbers upon their matriculation,
though the numbers are so locked down that even
Conte, a senior administrator, can only view the
last four digits I

This slip amounts to only one of the thousands
of security breaches that happen each year in or-
ganizations in and out of academia V

There were 365 security incidents where private
information was exposed at colleges and universities
nationwide last year‘, according to the Educational
Incidents’ year in review publication These

. types of incidents included information like Social

Security numbers, usernames and passwords, and
ﬁnancial, medical and educational information.

That’s 124 percent more incidents in 2008
than the two previous years Of those incidents,
about 33 percent, or 120 incidents, involved the
exposure of Social Security numbers, with Pitt’s
incident included.

Rodney Petersen, the security task force coordi-
nator for EduCause, a nonprofit group that works
with information technology in higher education,
said “those numbers pale in comparison” to the

total number of information security issues in *

government organizations and in corporations

“If you want to talk about comparison, univer- .

sities lead the way” in keeping data secure, hesaid.
“But we still need to do a far better job.”

He said that large research universities similar
to Pitt are leading the curve toward safe data pro-
tection because they have the resources and staff
that can put progress in motion. A

Out or the more than 4,000 public and private
universities in the United States, Petersen estimates
that Pitt is in the top third of schools that have
moved away from  Social Security numbers
as identiﬁers ' - - i

work in neighborhoods,” she said. - .
Though she believes in having more of-
ficers on the job and equipping them with
whatever they need, she wants to reopen C0111‘,
munity centers to Pittsburgh’s youth that have
been closed since the city was declared a dis-
tressed municipality under the Municipalities
Financial Recovery Act, last year.
~ One of the mayor’s plans that Robinson

a would not uphold is his commitment to a
' city—county merger. She believes that Pitts-

burgh and Allegheny County can merge for
buying power without Pittsburgh giving up
its "control. '

“It’s something that I heard in 1989 when
I was coming on to the police force, that the
city was going to support the county, not
the other way around. Now that we have

‘this young mayor, he’s willing to give up city

sovereignty,” said Robinson.

She added that there are uncalculated
costs, such as merging the city and county
police departments. If the two entities com-
bine, the officers making less will have their
wages increased to match those making more
money. ‘

Robinson, a Pittsburgh native and Pitt
alumna, said that her plan to promote small
business development will help the city retain
its younger population.

“I think they’re more willing to take risks
than the rest of us. I  that corporations
and other big. businesses are realizing their
bottom lines, they’re laying a ton of people
off. I think that ‘mom and pop" businesses

_ are the way to go,” she said.

Robinson said that ‘Pitt nurtured her as a
freshman, offering a summer program geared
toward helping minority students to improve
their writing. She’s grateful to the University

P and said that she wants to incorporate more 7

of those kinds of programs. V

, She doesn’t believe in the mayor’s comrnit—
ment to diversity, which is the 11th item on his
“Blueprint for Pittsburgh’s Renaissance.”

“I’m here to tell you that women and"

minorities are qualiﬁed, and certainly, if I

become mayor, my cabinet is not going to be

all white males,” she said. “It’s going to be a
lot of females, a lot of minorities and a lot
of qualiﬁed people, and it is going to be fairly

Movie night at Carnegie Mel-
 lon is about to get a hell of a lot
jsexier on April. 26. Instead of
 showing the latest comedy -or
iaction ﬂick, participating CMU
‘istudents will watch “The New
 Devil in Miss Jones”! — a hard-
 core porn ﬁlfn. ,

 The student—run activities
iboard at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
 versity shows 48 ﬁlms per semes-
 ter, and in the past, the viewing
 of blockbusters like “WALL-E”
iand “Iron Man” drew sizeable
!crowds to the school’s McCon-
 omy Auditorium. While students
 are offered a range of movie
igenres, a porno is shown once
iper semester, according to the

,  Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

 ' When the activities board
 showed “Pirates II: Stagnetti’s Re-
 venge” —-— the fairly mainstream,
 massively popular adult movie
 ——- attendance rates tied those of

§“The Dark Knight” screening.‘

 Clearly, there appears little doubt
 of porn night’s popularity.

 At _ ﬁrst glance, some are
3 bound to feel that something as
lewd as pornography shouldn’t

 be exhibited at an educational
'  institution. Perhaps such material

3 is inconsistent with a learning en-
 vironment.

/But we shouldn’t forget, the

 activities board’s movie show—
 ings probably aim to provide its
laudience with one thing: enter-
 tainment. The board isn’t show-
 ing educational videos, it’s mostly
 showing movies we’d go and
 see in theaters to be, well, enter-
? tained. ’ . i p r

  Porn screenings at

audiences have paid little heed to 
the sexual side of the content. In
the past, the student audiences E_
adopted a light-hearted, airy 
mentality reﬂecting the absurdity 
of the situation. It_’s most likely?
that CMU students will take their i
seats on April 26 ready to jeer and j

laugh more than anyth_ing.else.

While ‘ admission! to other 
ﬁlms put on by the board costé
students $51, pornography show— 
ings don’t use student activity 
fees because the producers don’t 
charge for their screenings‘ on f
campus. Because no university :
funds are involved, even if critics 
don’t agree with the content dis- 
played,. neither their money nor E

support these exhibitions.

It’s Pronounced ‘Lehe_’

  

by Lewis Lehe

 
 

It happened again last week. I A

was riding down Dawson Street at
2 a.m., and as a guy..passed me in
his -Land Rover, he rolled down the?

window’ and yelled, “Bikes suck!” ~

Then he sped away into the 

If you ride a bicycle, people yell
at you all. the time. But this isn’t a
column for bikers, it’s a column for
people who yell at bikers. I want to
let you know that youican do a lot
better. _

No one ever yells  re-
ally .biting or clever. It’s almost '
always, “Bikes suck!” The thing

about “Bikes suck!” is that no one

really believes bikes suck. It’s like
saying that free ‘speech or babies
or sunshine sucks. Bikes are some-

A thing everybody likes fromthe time

'they’re 5. _ L
I ~ know what _happens: You i

see someone on a bike and think,

“They’re different, and I can drive

away really. fast.” It’s ‘obvious what _

needs to be done. It’s the perfect
setup: you yell an insult and leave
it to burn long after you’ve escaped
with your  engine.

But then when you roll down
the window, suddenly nothing
comes out. What was that you were
gonna shout from your half-ton

_ bully pulpit? It eludes you."

The possibility of the situation
towers over your barren faculties,
and you know that you will never
live up to this. The moment is slip-
ping, so you say, “Bikes suck!” You
pump your ﬁst in triumph and juice
the gas in the hope that enthusiasm
will eclipse content, but the void
leaves you empty as you streak
away ——- not ﬂying, but escaping!

,And the biker in your dust isn’t ,

stung. He’s just amused. So amused

that ‘later he will write a, column C

about you and the horde‘ of dis-
pensable grunts just like you. But it
doesn’t have to be this way.

A What is it that made" you want

to yell in the ﬁrst place? There must i
_ have been some motive. -Look deep

in your heart of hearts. Maybe it’s
not the bikes you hate, ‘so much

. as the people who ride them: their

tight pants, messenger bags, beards,
thick-rimm‘ed glasses, ridiculously
tiny little hats and worst of all the
way they roll up one pant leg!

We all rode bikes from 5 years
old and onward, and no kid in the
whole barrio thought there was any

_ danger backthen of your pant leg

Bikers Worthy of better insults 

getting stuck in the gears, though

the pant-leg—rolling—up phenom—.‘
enon suggests it’s a mortal hazarél 

of bike—riding.

Then there is the unsupportable
trend of bikers walking around with
their pant-legs rolled up hours after
the bike is chained up. It’s a careful-
ly calculated, conscious act of ab-
sentinindedness ’ that lets everyone
with their ear to the ground know
that the kid in those pantsisnone
other than a bona ﬁde biker — like
if fat cat bankers tallied all their

proﬁts on‘ their arms with sharpie§. "

The hypocrisy is infuriating.

Also, you can assume rightly
that these biker types are feeling
very pleased with themselves over
the way they are riding around in

trafﬁc, getiing ﬁt, spaiing the erf: 

vironment and saving money. So,

’ when you roll down your window,

yell something that strikes at the

-heart of this smugness. And they
‘ go so fast! . ->
After practice and with some

maneuvering, they can dance

around your trafﬁe jams. They fur— '

ther believe that everyone chooses
to be in a car over riding a bike and

are silently.judging you in propor: C

Lehe, page 25.

“Global warming is inevitable!

Your contribution is marginal! And

obesity is genetic!” , . ,
If you yell this out of your car

‘ ﬁt a biker, I guarantee you _will leave

a bigger impression than the pro-
verbial “Bikes suck!” It exposes the
fruitlessness of their enterprise. But
we’re just getting started, because

biking is only one arena of human

accomplishment, that dangles over
‘a void. Something else you could
yell: _ i . ;
“I  saw under the sun that

the race is not to the swift and the
- battle is not to the warriors! And

neither is bread to the wise nor .

“wealth to the discerning nor favor
to men of ability! For time and
chance overtake them all!” ‘

Finally, remindthem of  _-

mortality: »

I “Death greets us. all with the
same cold handshake, alone and
unremarka_bl_e,"as_ deaf to the brave
as to the coward.” _

So go! ahead and yell. But one
thing to keep in mind is that, while
you and your target biker might be
worlds apart, geographically_ you

might live on the same street. Awk-

ward! Once I had the experience
of getting yelled at by a would—be

The richnot above

by Matt Diabesi

Colummlat

I just won the lottery! I’m so
excited that I can barely make the
proper phone calls I need to'make
and sign the forms I need to sign.
Oh, there’s just so much to, do now.

Time to buy up everything
I’ve ‘ever wanted: a diamond—en—
crusted ball pit, a swing set made of
platinum with gold chains, a great
big marble slide, an onyx fort and
a private helicopter ——  pad
and batteries included. Of course,
I’ll have to invite over and befriend
some wealthy? bigwigs like Mark
Zuckerberg and Jay Rockefeller,
and I’ll need a full staff of maids to

’  us lemonade on the more sul-

try days. But first thing’s first I need
to register as a Libertarian.

V Now that I’ve made this hard-
earned money, I finally understand
the Libertarian’s frustrations with
the completely overbeanng govern-

ment under which we live. I had I

   

   

to give away millions in taxes from

my jackpot sum. That’s millions '

that could have been spent more
righteously on an emerald-studded
fence around my playground or an
assortment of cute cashmere sweat-
ers and silk trousers for my new
Chihuahua. I’ve heard the argument
from these whining liberals a million
times: Taxes are fair. Really, they’re
like a forced charity. Well, I don’t
see any of the beneﬁts from them.
When will I get something for my
share of input? _

' And what about all this non-
sense on banks being bought up by
the government? Am I the only one
who sees where this is going? Presi-
dent Barack Obama and his social-
ist schemes are moving this coun-
try straight into Dante’s proverbial
Marxist  of hell! ‘As frightened
as I am of the violent harnmer-and-
sickle revolution that seems‘closer
than the nose. of - my yacht, I am
identifying myself publicly as a Lib-

ertanan now so all can know how '

brave and _dutiful I was to society.
Perhaps society owes me a plaque.

Ystetiesof 

governmental infringement

Here’s a recent situation that
captures my real governmental

. gripe: A friend of mine called me up

the other day and asked for a couple
million dollars to buy his new man-
sion. He is a hardworking profes-
sional geranium farmer who boasts
a window box about 1 foot long. He

had no‘ trouble purchasing it because

of the generous loans of two banks

and was preparing to move_in when ,
the government stepped in and said,

“No!”

No? Since when does the
government have the power to tell
my friend what houses he can and

cannot buy? They told, him it was ‘

because the loan he was given — at
57.8 percent APY + was “unreal-
istic” .

This issue only gets worse. Ap-
parently, my children have to attend
school. I was arguing with a truancy
ofﬁcer about it “Why do my kids
need to go to school?” Iasked him,
standing at the  pearly
gates of my three—rnile cobblestone
driveway. “ .

' So your kids can move up in

     

the world -—— learn, grow, you know,

just send ’em,” he retorted. Move up
in the world? The  I’ve been
told by the government ever since I
obtained my wealth have been more
and more ludicrous. This commu-

nist “democracy” has clearly fallen -

out of touch with its wealthiest,
most loyal citizens who hold, this

country up as the prosperous su-

perpower that it is. My children are
already on top of the world. They

.don’t need to contribute to society.

And what does the public have to
offer them but headaches on public
buses and herpes on public toilets?
Just when I thought it deemed
itself Big Brother of everything else
in my private life, the government
took‘ another huge step inside my
Swarovski, crystal-knobbed, oak
French doors. They told me the
wage I was paying ‘my lemonade-
bearing servants wasn’t enough!
Honestly, I feel like just  my
checkbook .over to the government
and throwing my hands up in the
air. They decide how much of my

money goes to my workers, how

much of it goes to the U.S. 

and which houses my friend can put
his money toward.‘ They even re-
cently determined that a sum of my
_money has to go toward planting
trees and opening solar plants —— as“

if having to pay to clean up ]ay’s oil ’

spill wasn’t enough paternalism for
the day!

Well, after that rant I feel like
some of my “less fortunate/"’ — aka
not as hard—working-—— peers might
be a little hot‘ under the blue collar.
I’ll have you know I just wrote a $1
million check to cancer research —
that’s 351 million that wouldn’t have
gone there if the government had
taken it from me. Oh my, I’m almost,
late for my 14-hour massage.

Margaret, more ice in this lem-
onade, please William, you can stop
 my column now.

music, beer and my pet gecko. So to
have a place like Hofbrauhaus open

lap. That said, Hofbrauhaus doesn’t

. disappoint. The softpretzels and‘

ment to the liter stems of beer,

call for two hands. Yes, that is a

Brazilian artist immerses herself in urban chaos

Admission is free

- Students who come to Pitt from
small towns often feel overwhelm_ed
by the urban lifestyle — the trafﬁc,
the police,'the immense crowds.

But according to ﬁlmtnaker Adri-
ana Babinski, there are patterns in
the urban chaos — patterns of liv-

4‘ing and -interacting, of coming and

going — that can unite us in shared
experiences. It’s these experiences
that Babinski seeks to capture in
her upcoming documentary exhibit,
“Immersion”

_ “My focus is on an urban life-
style,” said Babinski, a Brazil native
and Pittsburgh Filmmakers graduate.
“I wanted people to really realize and
compare the similarities.”

“Immersion” stays true to .its

 

 gwe arrives a

title.

Rather than just focusing her ﬁlm
on a single screen, Babinski catego-
ries her work as a “mirrored” art
installation. In other words, there are

three different screens, arranged in a '

U shape, simultaneously projecting
the sights of different cities from
around the world (China, Brazil and

the United States), with one screen

for each location.

“I wanted people to be immersed
in this arena of three different cul-
tures,” said Babinski.‘

The ﬁlm does not follow a single

narrative, but rather progresses by
theme. ~ ' _ -
“My editing is based‘ off what’s

going on in these three different cul-
tures, but they’re always doing similar
things,” she said.

For example, when the ﬁlm fo-
cuses on music, one screen will show
a chorus of drummers in Brazil, an—
other  show a Pittsburgh blues

band in the Strip District, and the -

third will show a solitary woodwind
instrumentalist in China. There’s a
different speaker for each screen,
 Babinski hopes will create a
feeling of engagement.

“You can hear ambient “sounds,” '
said Babinski. “People are going to ‘
V be moved not just by the image, but

also by the sound.”
Babinski said the sheer diversity

of the United States gave her the

idea for “lmmersioni”
“Since I moved to Pittsburgh, I

started having much more contact

with different cultures,” said Babin-
ski. “It was an inspiration. I wanted
to show a contrast, I wanted to go
to different places but to have the
same goal.”

Making “Immersion” was not
always easy. Babinski traveled and
ﬁlmed almost entirely by herself,

“I can’t speak any Mandarin, any a

unsure. an

“I was looking for really spon-
taneous and honest actions,” said
Babinski. “When people see a cam-
era, they kind of act, they hide.”

Babinski also ran into trouble in
her native Brazil. According to her
Web site, police ‘threatened to conﬁs-

‘cate her camera unless she stopped

ﬁlming an arrest.

“I got the arrest on ﬁlm but they
weren’thappy about it,” said Babin-
ski on her Web site. “It was a little
scary, but I’m glad I got it.”

Though navigating such for-
eign landscapes was surely difﬁcult,"

Babinski is without remorse.
“It was one of the most '

trips I’ve_ ever had, especially’ because

‘I was by myself,” said Babinski. “I

wanted ‘to document, I wanted to
experiment and go to different
places. And deﬁnitely, I got what I

' was expecting.”

If nothing else, Babinski hopes

her ﬁlm will help inspire a feeling of

r togetherness.

“Regardless of the way people
look, their language, their religion
 we are all human beings,” said
Babinski.

Babes, cash and odd-shaped guns ‘are all in Ninja Academy's arsenal. The band swoops

into Brillobox this Sunday.

‘ by Sarah Simkin
Staff Writer

NINJA ACADEMY

The Brillobox

4104 Penn Ave. _
Sunday,.May‘ 3, 9 p.m.
21 and older

It started off as a classic “wouldn’t—it-be-
funnyi-if *insert foolish idea here*” joke.

But unlike most. absurd ideas, starting a
band called Ninja Academy actually became
a reality. _ '

In keeping with its secret assassins motif,

the drums and /bass duo go by stage names-

Indo Ninja (joey Maramba)  Outdo Ninja
(Robert Shaffer).

“The idea of being Ninja Academy ﬁts
what we were trying to do,” said Maramba.

“We3re all about the community, playing with I

other people and sharing ideas.”

The ninjas describe their music as “bass
and drums instruinental fury” and “pummel-V
ing your ear drums  in a good way.”

- “Our band features the rhythm section as
theband. Stylistically it’s kind of hard to say

' what we play because we tend to go pretty

much everywhere, which is what I kind of

_ really like aboutiit, we can. play anything,”
said Maramba. ‘ V ' ' .i
A ‘‘‘\When people ask what genre we play, L

I say instrumental rock, even though we
play everything from punk rock to jazz,”
said Shaffer. ‘-

“As far as the ninja -thing goes it’s pretty
much just the outﬁts. We hit a gong before
and after we play, but that’s not really ninja, '
just Asian-ish,” said Maramba. ’ '

The duo hopes for a late summ_er.release
for itsnew album, which is ﬁnished but
awaiting mastering and an autumn promo-
tional tour, Despite being its third studio
album, the band chose to self title it.

“I think the reason [for the eponymous
title] is I feel like this is our first real album
in some ways. There’s something about this

one that I feel really,‘ really‘ represents us,
‘ so that’s why I like the idea of having that

self-titled,” Maramba.

In addition to boasting ﬁve or.six_ guest
performances, Maramba said the new album
“is a bit more epic,,more elaborate. Our last

— album was a little more in your face and

stripped down. The new album has more
to it, a lot more layers.”

The ninjas have been playing music to-
gether since they were inhigh school and
as the band Ninja Academy for. six years.
They are not yet signed to a” record label,’ A
agent or any of the traditional music indus-

‘try contacts.

‘Everything we do is independent --
the recording,‘ this tour, everything,” said,

~ Ninja Academy, page 31
Having total control of everything from

booking to recording can be nice but, as‘

Maramba pointed out, “We get 100 percent
of the proﬁts, but 100 percent of nothing is
still nothing. I would give up some control
to get bigger gigs. Doing it all ourselves is a
lot of work, it’s very difficult.”

No two Ninja Academy performances
are quite the same. S

“We have what we call guest ninjas. Ba-
sically we’ve built up a roster of different
people that come and jam with us,” said
Maramba. ~ .

These guests are anything from violinists
to vocalists to martial artists who perform
onstage. T

The ninjas jokingly listed Madonna as

a crucial inﬂuence, but upon further con— '

templation Maramba said, “Our inﬂuences
become bigger and bigger the older we get,
I think a lot of it has to do with people and

relationships. Things make you feel a certain
way and you write accordingly.”

Ninja Academy’s composition process
varies. Maramba said, “Sometimes the song
is done even before we play it. It’s hard to ex-
plain. Other times a song might take months
to ﬁnish, it really depends.” V

The Los—Angeles—based duo will be com-

‘ ing to Pittsburgh in May as part of its first

national tour.

“Since this is our ﬁrst tour, I’m just look-
ing forward to playing, seeing the country,
meeting a lot of cool people, forming rela-
tionships with bookers and fans, let people
hear our music. That’s gonna be the *most
fun part for me, seeing people’s reactions to
what we do,” said Shaffer.

“They see the ninja thing and they go
what the hell is this and then they hear us
play and they’re blown away  not to sound

cocky or anything,” said Maramba.

The one element decisively missing in

Texan roots —— is Southern twang.

W/ith spring drills now over

. and the Blue—Gold gamea dis-

tant memory, it’s time to look at
how far the Pitt football team
has come and where it still needs _

‘to go.. ‘ ’ ' /

The Panthers still have their
fair share of unresolved issues

on both sides of the ball.

But with an extremely-tal-

A ented defensive line and play-

makers like Jonathan Baldwin.
on ‘offense, this team hopes to
ﬁnd itself ultimately on top of
the Big East. . _

_ Here’s a breakdown of P a

 probable Pitt startinglineup and .

a recap of some burning issues

, the team still faces as the summer P
-approaches. H ' ' V

Things to consider: _
The quarferbaczér One of the _

paramount concerns‘ for Pitt

fans, after last season’s Sun Bowl, '

has been the necessity for im-
provement _at the quarterback
position. /

‘After the conclusion of

spring practice, there have been ,

no dramatic changes under cen-
ter. Bill Stull would be the starter
if the Panthers were playing a
game this week, but that doesn’t
mean his two fellow quarterbacks
haven’t made strides. ‘
PatBostick received the Ed

l‘lConway Award as the most im:
proved offensive player through-

out spring practice. Physically

{ and mechanically, Bostick has

come a longway from his former
slow—footed frame.

A Still, while Bostickihas pro-
vided Stull with a little. pressure,

’ he hasn’t done -enough to take-
-_ the job away from the incumbent

starter. ‘ '

5/3 vs. USF (DH) P . g " S

V With _both quarterbacks
having their fair share of past
struggles, redshirt freshman Tino

Sunseri has had an opportunity .

to make a signiﬁcant impression
in spring drills. Unfortunately for
Sunseri, he hasn’t had the stun-
ning performances necessary to
jump Bostick and Stull on the
depth chart.

If one thing is certain, it’s.

that the quarterback race is still
open and Stull’s job isn’t carved

‘ in stone yet. It will be interesting

to see if Bostick continues to‘

' progress under new quarterbacks
coach and offensive coordinator ,
Frank Cignetti. If he does, then,

Stull  have to respond with
a conﬁdent and efficient sum-
mer camp. ‘ 2

At the moment, the future
of Pitt’s most crucial position
remains unclear.

Injuries a past problem for linebackers

Football, page 7

shirt freshman Chris Burns and redshirt
sophomore Shariff Harris will push Lewis
for playing time. V

Burns is another talented runner with
heaps of potential. If Lewis slips up, Burns
could easily take the majority of carries for

_the Panther offense. Harris, on the other

hand, is a strong downhill runner who has
shifted back and forth between halfback
and fullback. With his versatility, Harris is
more than capable of earning some carries
for himself next fall. _ T

\X/hether Pitt employs one feature back
or a running—back—by—committee approach,
having an overstock of talent at the tailback
is a good problem to have. The only thing
this group lacks is experience, but that will
change soon.

Problem; in the middle: One has no starting
experience after four seasons with the team,
another missed most of ‘last season with

 s

Fields is an amazing
athlete but has ‘had his
share of off—the-ﬁeld '

is sues.

severe neck injury, and the last one is still
recovering from a torn ACL.
That describes Steve Dell, Adam Gunn

and Shane Murray, respectively. Those three

redshirt seniors are being called upon to ﬁll
the hole left by the graduationoof middle
linebacker Scott McKillop.

Undoubtedly, the trio of linebackers pro-
vides a good deal of experience and maturity.
ButiDell is an unproven commodity, while
Gunn and Murray haven’t'beer_1 practicing
at full speed yet. .

The likely starter when the season begins
is Gunn, who was recently granted a sixth
season of eligibility by the NCAA. When
healthy, Gunn has been a reliable performer
at the strong-side linebacker position, but
whether Gunn can replace McKillop’s pro
ductivity remains to be seen.- ‘

At a glance, the middle linebacker position
appears to be one of the most experienced
groups. But a closer examination reveals that
injury concerns make Pitt’s most important
defensive position its shakiest.

Rmcjy to make an iirgpan‘: On the brighter

side, a handful of Panthers have used the‘

spring to display that they are ready to join
the starting lineup. P ,_

One of those players is former Army
All—American offensive lineman Lucas Nix.

Now a sophomore, Nix will be called upon
to provide stability to Pitt’s offensive front.
The Thomas Jefferson  School gradu-
ate is overflowing with pptential and should
grow in his starting role;-pi . ,

On the other side of   Elijah Fields
will get the opportunity to prove himself at
the strong safety position. Fields is an amaz-
ing athlete but has had his share of off—.the—
ﬁeld issues. Now, with Eric Thatcher gone,
Fields and Dom DeCicco could become

walnutu

glfl

two of the most talented safety tandems in
the Big East. .
Lastly, redshirt sophomore Max Gruder
was the defense’s  Conway award winner.
Gruder has displayed impressive instincts at
the weak—side linebacker position, and his
physical play has earned him a starting job.
Gruder has a motor that is always going,
and with Greg W/illiams opposite him, the
Panthers have two young, talented bookends

' at linebacker.
