Faculty Assemblyasks Marous to resign as BOT chair

By Scot Ross and

Jennifer Calabrese
The Pitt News

Having failed “to translate the university’s core academic
values into appropriate board policy,” John Marous was
asked to resignas Pitt Board of Trustees chairperson by
a unanimous vote of the Faculty Assembly yesterday.

Marous has been criticized within the university
community for approving perks and low-interest loans
for former Preside; l[ Wesley Posvar, including a retirement
package of over $3.3 million.

When the retirement ﬁgures were disclosed this summer,
Marous said he was unaware of the specifics of the
package. But various documents approving the benefits
bear Marous’ signature.

Reading from a statement issued Friday by the University
Senate budget-policies committee, _member Maureen
McClure said, “We found it unacceptable for the person
principally responsible,fo_r the actions of the BOT to

obligate our university without knowledge of either the

substance or the effects of those actions.”
The statement included references to the long—standing

debate over the ‘university’s role as an “academy of

partners and not a corporation of managers and

 

   

SGB joins call

The Student Government Board voted to ask for
the resignation of John Marous, the chairperson of
the Board of Trustees.

“Although Mr. Marous has contributed much to
the University of Pittsburgh, it appears that his
prolonged negligence in regard to fulfilling his
obligations as chairman of the Board of ‘Trustees
cannot go unnoticed,” the statement said. “We are

employees.” The Faculty Assembly also described the
board's policy—making as “university fiat.”

Faculty Assembly member Irwin Schulman expressed
anger at the lackqof parity between board—approved
salaries for faculty members and Posvar, according to

figures of the American’ -Association of Universities.
Posvar’s salary ranked near the top of the 57 AAU
members, while faculty salaries fell to 47 on the list.

He cited the February 1990 near-unanimous no-
conﬁdence vote Posvar received from the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. “Despite this clear evidence of lack of
faculty support, Mr. Marous and his colleagues thatspring
gave Posvar an increase in salary of nearly 20 percent,”
Schulman said.

During the meeting Schulman made an -unsuccessful
attempt to have the entire executive committee of the
board included in the resignation proclamation. An
additional amendment, which also failed, called for
Marous to have no position with the board.

According to university spokesperson Tim Ziaukas,
Marous is presently out of town.

In other business:

Staff Writer

Nearly 1,800 students and
faculty members signed a petition
circulated by the United Faculty
supporting the Cowell bill, an
amendment to the state Right to
Know law which would open the
financial records of Pitt and other
state—related universities to the
public.

“We hope that the strong show
of the petition will persuade the
senate committee to support the
bill,” ‘United Faculty President
Philip Wion said. _

Wion said a press conference
will be held to forward the
signatures to state Sen. James
Rhoades, chairperson of the State
Senate Education Committee,
where the bill is presently waiting
for a vote;

The United Faculty started

circulating the petition two weeks ‘

ago. David Rosenberg, a‘Pitt
librarian and UF member, said he
‘aspires to gather over 2,500
signatures within the next several
weeks.

“I think it’s important that future
lawyers stand up and hold the
university accountable about how
they spend the money," he said.

Rosenberg said several hundred
signatures were collected in two
hours at a booth outside Scaife
Hall. “This shows that the people
at Pitt are concerned about the
scandals of the Posvar
administration and that the
school’s records should be open
to scrutiny," Rosenberg said.

UF member Carol McAllister

said she has worked on circulating
many petitions but has never
seen such an overwhelming

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, October 2, 1991

 

Drinking impairs judgment, ‘abstract thinking’

In 1982, a Pitt student fell to his
death from a window in
Brackenridge Hall. No, it wasn't a
suicide. It was a horrible
consequence of impaired
judgement caused by alcohol.
The night in question he climbed
into a window to party with
friends. When a fire alarm went
off (pulled by someone who
probably had been drinking), he
decided to leave the same way he
came in-—by a window. However
the window he chose was on a
different side of the building —
one with a 30-foot drop. Later,
his friends said he didn't seem
very drunk.

Even before you feel the
alcohol, it has affected the way
you think and make decisions.
These are decisions you tend to
regret. They result in the anxiety
you feel towards the end of the
semester because you partied
rather than studied. It's the “Oh,
I wish he/she would just leave”
in the morning feeling. (And if a
condom wasn't used: “What did I
catch”)

' At the Student Health Service,

 

we recognize that problems
resulting from alcohol use are
not merely problems of legality,
but are problems of health and
safely. Student Health Service, in
a partnership with the Office of
Residence Life, Student Affairs
and the Judicial Board, has
responded by developing the
Personal Education, Assessment
and Referral program. PEAR is a
series of three one-and-a-half hour
classes, plus one individual
meeting with the university's
substance-abuse prevention
specialist. PEAR is for everyone,
not just those who have a problem
or are alcoholics. PEAR is

designed to help prevent
problems and alcoholism.

PEAR is unlike any other
alcohol—education program you
have ever experienced. It is not a
lecture on the evils of drugs. We
do not say, “just say no.” In fact,

96 percent of the students who_

completed PEAR last year agreed
that it is valuable to the college
community. Some even
commented that it should be
required of all students. This is
especially significant because
none of the students were
voluntary participants! AH ‘had
been found in violation of alcohol
policies and so were required to
attend PEAR. They certainly came
in very angry — they left pleased.
PEAR provides only accurate,
up-to—date information.

For instance, did you know
that getting drunk even once
(deﬁned as five or more drinks)
can impair your ability to engage
in abstract thinking for 30 days?
Now what do you think happens
when you get drunk Thursday,
Friday and Saturday? Well, think
back to the start of your first year

 

in college — how many people
that you knew then are no longer
here? They may have been unable
to perform undergraduate
academics because of impaired
abst/ract thinking that resulted

from only weekendpartytng.

How many of you had to switch
from majors that demanded heavy
abstract thinking such as math or
engineering because “it was just
too hard?" It may have seemed
too hard because your weekend
partying had impaired your
abilities at abstract thinking! Kind
of scary! And we haven’t even
mentioned alcohol dependence,
which will result in tragedy and
broken lives for about 10 percent.

‘of students who drink.

If you are worried about
yourself or a friend and would

like to get information and talk to -

someone, attending the PEAR
program is a good move. To sign

SAVEd sponsors date-rape awareness program

By Suzann Gries
For T be Pitt News

Think of your six closest female friends.
One of them will be raped before_ she
graduates.

This was posted on a sign below a
television monitor in the Towers lobby as
part of Date Rape Awareness Day
yesterday.

A committee called SAVEd, which stands
for Sexual Assault and Violence Education,
sponsored the awareness day. The
committee is made up of eight resident
assistants.

Mark I-lorgan, a fifth—year senior and a

rape intensified when a close friend
conﬁded in him that she had been raped.
Horgan said the biggest misconception
about date rape is that the girl asked for it.

It doesn't matter what the girl was
wearing or how she was acting, “no
means “no,” according to Horgan.

“You don’t have to know anybody that
was raped to get involved or be concerned
or aware of date rape,” said David Hinkle,
a junior and a resident assistant. Hinkle
said after being at college and living in the
dorms for two years, he became
increasingly aware of the attitudes toward
rape.

“It’s a very violent crime. Even if you
don’t walk away with scars all over your

body, it's mentally scarring,” Hinkle said.

Hinkle said women can help prevent
date rape by saying what they are thinking
and setting clear limits .for acceptable
behavior. ‘

“It’s seen as a woman’s problem. It’s not
just a woman's problem; it’s a
communication problem,” Hinkle said..

Horgan and Hinkle sat in the Towers
Lobby yesterday, handing out information
about date rape.

In addition to the ﬂyers, there was a 20-
minute video that focused on the
experiences of four college women.

Horgan and Hinkle said many students
stopped to pick up flyers, but few asked
questions.

The chairperson of SAVEd and the

resident director of Lothrop Hall", MaryEllen in V 

Hiotakis, was a resident assistant at
Duquesne University. _

She said she started dealing with rape A
victims and the issues of rape during her" ’

years at Duquesne.

“The perspective we try to take with the
male is not only how to communicate
better but the perspective that this could
happen to their girlfriend or a female
friend,” Hiotakis said. V '

Hiotakis said there have already been
six programs about date rape this month
and SAVEd will also be working with.
issues of dating and domestic violence as
well.

Apathy hurts Pitt rideshare

By Eric Smith
For The Pitt News

Student apathy is blamed for the ineffectiveness of the Pitt
ridesharing program, according to the program manager of the
ridesharing office.

While attracting university medical center employees in
significant numbers, ridesharing receives roughly 200 student
applicants a semester, according to Kathleen Miller. Miller said
there are an estimated 15,000 student commuters on any given
day.

A lack of applicants narrows the success rate of carpool
matches for the commuting student population, Miller said.

“Do you think that if a student has a new car, he's going to
be interested in ridesharing?” Miller said.

The ride—share program matches names of people living in
a particular area and gives the applicant an updated list of
telephone numbers.

But there’s a catch. The applicant must call the numbers and
work out the details unassisted. 6

Many students Contact the ridesharing ofﬁce concerning
‘available student parking, but the university has not designated ,
any student parking. Some call regarding long-distance rides
for weekends and breaks. The office advises using bulletin
boards on campus.

The office also acts as an intermediary for a van-leasing
program. 0

Ridesharing will match applicants with rotating shifts and
various schedules, but many students are unwilling to wait the
standard eight hours between rides, according to Miller.

“Here’s a radical idea. [The student] could go to the library
or something,” Miller said.

Because of changing schedules, student records at ridesharing

’ must be redone every semester. p
‘Afuture goal of the office is to have students enter the
ridesharing system during admissions. All non—residents of
Oakland could be matched to increase the likelihood and ease
of carpooling.

The new document asks faculty members to disclose if they

“It almost goes beyond the disclosure that is being asked of

‘ P a person who holds public ofﬁce,” said biology professor Fred

' 0Schulman addressed the assembly on eight resolutions he is
sponsoring. ~ _ ,
The resolutions include stopping the practice of giving
administrators extra beneﬁts, li‘mitingan administrator's term to
12 years and having the Board of Trustees regularly audit th
expense accounts of all administrators. -
“The Posvar scandal has thrown a lurid light on an unfortunate
feature of life at Pitt: the gulf between administrator and the
faculty, “Schulman said.
“These resolutions are designed to facilitate the restoration of
a desperately needed harmony of interest and outlook between
faculty and administration." ‘ .
The assembly voted on one of eight resolutions proposed b

' Schulman and tabled the rest until the next meeting.

The resolution that was voted on had proposed to recommend
that no university building be named after Posvar. It was
defeated by a 13-9 vote. A

“I don’t want to support the pettiness of singling [Posvar] out,”
former University Senate President James Mauch said.

Other committee members
asked the candidates, “‘What will
you be doing in 10 years?’ and
‘Are you familiar with the situation
in the President’s office?”’
Saunders said.

Applicants for homecoming
court had mixed opinions about
the new selection process.

‘ Andi John of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, who applied for a
position on the court, felt that the
new system did not represent the
student body. V

“If next year they would have
the whole university vote on the
court, then have the interview,
then no one could really
complain,” John said.

John also disagreed with the
types of questions asked by the
judges.

“The questions just were not
relevant. I thought they were
going to ask about me, but they
asked issue ‘questions. I was
thrown off [by the questions], but
that’s my fault,” John said.

“I didn’t feel like the people
who interviewed were a fair
representation of the university,
but no one’s ever going to be
satisﬁed with the process.”

Golden said the process is a
good idea. “I do think that the
process, if done right — I don’t‘
know all the details— is excellent.
The idea is excellent. It should be
a reward for past contributions to
the campus,” Golden said.

Q

err

Asleep at the wheel

When it was revealed last week that Pitt Board of
Trustees Chairperson John Marous’ signature was all over
former Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s retirement package,
the university community was confused and outraged.

Announcing that he knew nothing about Posvar’s
retirement package, Marous was presented with 165
pages of documents proving his knowledge of all of the
perks.

The Faculty Assembly announced yesterday its call for
Marous’ resignation, stating that Marous failed “to translate
the university’s core academic values into appropriate

L'."- ‘ board policy.” ' I .

Presently there are three organizations that have made
their dissatisfaction known. The Faculty Assembly, the
Student Government Board and the Student Council of
the College of General Studies have all expressed no
confidence in Marous as theboard chair.

Marous’ ~ credibility is non-existent not only at the

5 university but also in Harrisburg, where university
administrators crawl every year to beg for more money.
Because of the deception surrounding Posvar’s retirement
package, future funding for the university was placed in
jeopardy. _ ’

“We found it unacceptable for the person principally
responsible for the actions of the Board of Trustees to
obligate our university without knowledge of either the
substance or the effects of these actions,” the assembly
stated.

The Student Government Board in its statement said,
“Although Mr. Marous has_ contributed much to the
University of Pittsburgh, it appears that his prolonged

..—~cs negligence in regard to fulfilling his obligations as chair
of the Board of Trustees cannot go unnoticed.”

After an almost unanimous department chairpersons’
voteof no confidence against Posvar in February of 1990,

~.

Marous and the BOT authorized. a 20-percent salary.

increase for Posvar.

It was with extreme displeasure that the faculty sat and
watched as Posvar was handed money they felt he did not
deserve.

Since Pitt’s summer of scandal, it is widely known that

y «es the Pitt community needs a new administration that will
work for us and the faculty —— and not for itself.

“These resolutions are designed to facilitate the restoration
of a desperately needed harmony of interest and outlook
between faculty and administration,” said FaCultyAssembly
member Irwin Schulman. '

The actions taken by these groups are not without
justification. Marous and other university officials have
given students and faculty just cause to be concerned with
Pitt’s future as a respected university.

The reorganization of the Pitt administration is not only
necessary but imperative.

LOS ANGELES — Citing a “ﬁnancial responsibility
to myself and to the university,” Pitt President J.
Dennis OfCor_1nor today accepted an offer from
King World Productions to appear on the hit
television show Wheel Of Fortune.

O’Connor, in town ﬁlming the much anticipated
remake to his 1967 cult classic My

onnorto appear on ‘W'heel’

are two men, themselves embroiled in controversy:

Stanford University ex-President Dr. Donald . ._
Kennedy and Southern Risible Junior College _

President Dr. Nadir Mingle.
When Kennedy resigned from

was certain a presidentialyacht

Swedish Meatball Paradisio,

Griffin brought him a Coke
outside the NBC Commissary.
“This is just the beginning,” Griffin

could be written off as a research
related expense — some sponsors
were reluctant to include him
among the show’s credible
contestants. Their fears were,

was heard saying to no one in
particular. “First we’ll contract university presidents,
and then during Sweeps Week we’ll go after
foreign dissidents and nationalists. The Nielsen.
ratings are ours!” ' '

O’Connor today also confirmed speculation that
he would be playing for the grand prize: a 1991
emerald-green Jaguar XJ12, valued at $82,000. “I
need wheels to fit my lifestyle,” O’Connor said.

_ “That $16,000 rattletrap the Trustees expect me to

ride around in is just plain not cutting the mustard.
After all, I am a man of principle.”

Asked if he would donate any potential winnings
to the university to help curb rising costs, O’Connor
laughed. “Have you seen my house lately?” he said.
“The porch is falling apart, the gardeners are
comin g tomorrow, and next week we’re having the ,
backyard fitted for an Olympic-sized swimming
pool. I don’t know where you people think I come
up with the capital to pay for these things, but I
assure you money does not grow on trees ..."

9 Griffin, another self-proclaimed “principled man,”
is delighted to have O’Connor participate in his first
annual “Greedy College Olympiad.”

“After Dr. Posvar retired I was a little worried
we’d be unable to find an administrator shameless
enough to fill his place,” Griffin said. “Thank God
Dr. O’Connor arrived at Pitt when he did.”

Long known as the architect behind the Wbeelis
success, Grifﬁn also understands how parity among
competitors adds to the show’s quality. To
demonstrate this reasoning, he oftentimes pits
intellectually inferior Harvard students against
formidable community college opponents. “The
Crimson alumni just love it when I do that,” he said,
smiling.

Last season, after a Texas El Paso Correspondence
School graduate mistook the phrase I~TOI.D—YOU-
S0 for GIVE-ME-SOMEADOUGH and lost to then
celebrity champion, Princeton’s Brooke Shields, a
tiny on-stage scuffle broke out, injuring four persons
and hospitalizing two. ‘I never realized what a 9-
mm handgun shot to the chest felt like,‘ said best
boy Pattie ‘Pat’ Sajak from his Beverly Hills Memorial
hospital bed. ‘The only time I felt more pain was
when CBS cancelled dad's talk show and Mike
Wallace coerced me into returning my VIP pass.
Now that hurt!‘ ’

- mitigated somewhat this morning:
when, after‘ he was asked to describe himself in two
fabricated sentences or less, Kennedy responded,
“Well, unlike O’Connor and Mr. Grifﬁn, I am not
really a principled man. I do however, have certain
covert qualities that lead many psychiatric
professionals to assume I’m a narcissistic sociopath.
Is that two sentences or three?"

‘Other ranking Stanford administrators agreed.

“Stanford University has spent like this before‘

Kennedy arrived here, and, Godwilling, we’ll
spend like this in the future as-well. Our efforts
must be preserved,” said Dr. Barbara Finagle, dean
of interior design.

Such stuffy and lofty praise is not forthcoming for

Dr. Mingle, as charges of personal and directional ~

misconduct have rocked his administration.

The “Nadir Fallout,” as some economic analysts
have described it, began shortly after Southern
Risible police officers discovered Dr. Ming1e’s rain-
soaked and naked body lying in the bushes behind
the Lambda Blanda Santa sorority house.

“I know that in the past I’ve done some things I
probably shouldn't ought’ve done,” Mingle recalled
through an English interpreter. “But what you
people back east must remember is that Southern
Risible doesn't have the same kinda resources y'all
got. With our budget as low as it is and with our
alumni donations greasin’ as many palms as
inhumanly possible, we cannot, I repeat, CANNOT
cover up the kinds of things you people get away
with and expect not to get caught.

“Fortunately forus, however, our athletic director
is in current negotiations with a certain friend of
yours, a Mr. Michael Gottfried. It is our hope that by
signing Mr. Gottfried to a lifetime football coaching
contract, he will lead our Southern Risible Golden
Gamblers to the national prominence they had
once occupied

‘And by every account, with this type of leader-
at our helm, we will soon meet orexceed the likes
of Pitt and Stanford in all areas of academic and
athletic declination This is the challenge facing
Southern Risible Junior College that we aim to
meet. Y'all have mywoul—we‘regonna do it!‘

California trounces W0

Byjoe Foner
Stajf Writer

They came, they saw  well,
you know the story. The women’s
tennis team fell to 7-2 with a loss
to California (Pa), 8-1, at the
Cost Center yesterday. Don’t be
worried about the team, however,
as CUP is 12-0 and has pretty
much coasted through their
season to date.

In singles action, Jennifer
Jacobs was the lone winner, and
CUP didn’t give us this one easily
either, defeating Kim Pepper 7-6,
7-6.

On being the lone singles

, winnerJacobs said, “I was happy

to win; it was a tough match —
butl also feel bad for the team.”

The rest of the team didn’t fare
aswell, withJulie LoPrinzi losing
to Emma Lin 6-2, 6-1 and Erika
Devins losing to Monica Dinatale
6-3, 6-5. Raquel Cepeda lost to
Adrienne Wood 6-4, 6-2, and
Gwen Mclntyre was defeated by
Adele Norcross 6-2, 6-4. In her
first singles match this ‘year,
Michelle Rohm lost to Lisa Casper
6-3, 6-3.

Because CUP won five singles

_ matches, the match was already

decided. Both coaches agreed to
have pro-set play for the doubles
matches. Devins and LoPrinzi
lost to Lin and Pepper 8-4; Cepeda
and Jacobs lost to Dinatale and
Norcross 8-4 and McIntyre and
Chris Orie lost to Wood and

_ Casper 8-6. In his appraisal of the 3

match Coach George Dieffenbach
said, “We've never played [CUP]
before, so we didn’t have any

idea how they’d be. But they’re
very strong."

Last weekend the women’s
team went to ‘the Eastern
Collegiate Women’s Tournament
in Trenton, N.J. The team did
“average,” scoring three singles
wins, according to Dieffenbach.
Julie LoPrinzi won her first match,
defeating Joan Glass of Drexel O-
6, 7-6, 6-0. LoPrinzi then lost her
next match to Marcia Merono of
Syracuse 6-2, 6-3. Colleen
Kujawski won also, beating
Chishona Husband of Howard 6-
3, 3-6, 6-2, but then lost her next
match to Karen Hammerback of
Princeton 6-0, 6-0. Chris Orie
defeated Stacy M orgues of Drexel
6-1, 6-1 but lost to Kim Khoury of
Penn 6-0, 6-0. Erika Devins,
Raquel Cepeda and Gwen
M clntyre all lost their first matches.
In doubles action, LoPrinzi and
Devins had to retire due to injury,
resulting in a loss in their first
match".

Just in case you were
wondering where the team’s first
loss came from (and if you had
been following the team, you
would have known that they
were undefeated going into last
weekend), Pitt lost to Trenton
State (at Trenton State —
convenient for the regular-season
match) S-4, putting the team at 7-
1.

Coach Dieffenbach noted,
however, that “there was much
improvement over last year’s 7-2
loss [to Trenton State].”

The women are in action today,
hosting St. Vincent at the Cost
Center.

‘Les Habs’recaptur°eglorjy in saggz'ngAdams division

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

Once _the stronghold of the
NHL, the Adams division is on
the decline. The ’80s produced
only one Stanley Cup, Montreal
in '86, so it’s been a steady
downfall in the division the last
five years. Boston has been strong
for years but never captured the
prize. Buffalo has not gotten past
the ﬁrstround since 1983; Quebec
has not made the after-hours ball
in four years and Hartford? Well,
the Whalers remain beached.
Things do not look much better
this season, except in the French
provinces, particularly where the
Montreal Canadiens seem
ready to ﬂy to the top of the
division.

Les Habs are built like a house,

1 thanks to goaltender Patrick Roy,

still the NHL’s best. Roy played in
only 48 games a season ago, and
the Canadiens struggled in his
absence. Keeping Roy healthy is
the most important factor for the
faithful yet brutal Montreal fans.

Montreal still does it the right
way — with defense. Last year
Montreal opted for youth, and

the rewards are about to come-

due. The best are Americans
Mathieu Schneider and Eric

-Desjardins, both 22 and fresh

from Canada Cup duty. Both
showed massive potential, with

Schneider the more offensive-
minded and Desjardins more of a
stay-at-home type. Petr Svoboda
and J.J. Daigneault, who might
finally attain his potential, add
offense, while the rest of the D is
deep and worried about Roy.

The Canadiens have had
trouble scoring in recent years,
but if the playoffs are any
indication, several veterans are
ready to produce en masse.
Speedy winger Russ Courtnall
led the Habs in scoring last season,
then added eight playoff goals,
while rugged winger Shayne
Corson scored nine postseason
goals to go along with 23 during
the regular campaign. General
manager Serge Savard dealt
sometimes-French favorite
Stephan Richer to NJ for Kirk
Muller. Muller lacks Richer’s touch
but makes up for it in consistency.
Denny Savard is still exciting,
and the Lebeau brothers, Stephan
(53 points) and Patrick (101 at
Fredricktown) are ready to
explode. The checking lines are
outstanding, led by Guy
Carbonneau, and depth is not a
problem. One key is the retum of
Sylvain Turgeon, who is a 40-
goal scorer if healthy but played
in only 19 games last season. The
Adams crown will be Red and
Blue. 3

In what should be a closer
battle for second place in the

- - . ; . .. .

division, expect the Buffalo

* Sabres to slide past Boston. If

Buffalo struggles early, look for
Coach Rick Dudley to get the axe
and former Edmonton coach and
new Sabre Director of Hockey
Operations John Muckler to take
over. If I were a Sabre fan, I’d be
praying for that day. The streaky
Sabres were an awful 15-13-2 at
home last year, and if that doesn’t
improve, expect a blowout in the

Adams. Goaltender Darren Puppa

struggled last year but still posted
a 3.38 goals-against average. In
his defense he was injured, but a

healthy, happy Puppa could make .

all the difference in Buffalo.
The word from northern New
York is the Sabres are ready to
make a blockbuster deal. ‘Til then
Buffalo’s offense will continue to
revolve around their fine centers,
Dale Hawerchuk, Pierre Turgeon,
Christian R_uuttu and Benoit
Hogue, who needs to improve
upon his 19 goals. Dave
Andreychuk leads the team’s big
wingers and remains the team’s
top sniper (36 goals). Rick Vaive
can still shoot, and Alexander

. Mogilny is smooth. Top prospects

include Reggie Savage and burner
Donald Audette. .

Uwe Krupp leads a big
defensive unit that needs to
contribute to the offense more.
That task remains in the hands of
Doug Bodger, who has to show

he can do it consistently. The
feeling here, though, is the Sabres
wish they still had Phil Housley.
Bodger is great as the second-
point man, but as the main trigger
he’s lacking. I hope he proves me
wrong, but not before the coach
gets canned.

As Cam Neely goes, so go the
Boston Bruins, which means the
beaners won't be doing anything
‘til November, when Neely returns
from knee surgery courtesy of Ulf
Samuelsson. Mike Milbury retired
to the upstairs after crying wolf in
the playoffs and Rick Bowness
takes over as the coach of a team
whose offense is in trouble.
Without Neely, Craig Janney is
gonna have to learn how to score
goals instead of setting up the
Cam-corder. Expect Janney to
take a beating. All-Rookie team
member Ken Hodge Jr, shows
promise to be a big p1ayer. If he
struggles, Boston is up the creek.

‘ Former Canuck Petri Skriko is

good for 60 points, but after that
Boston is thin, and drafting 18th,
21st, and 17th overall the last
three years has done nothing for
their prospects.

The defense and goaltending
of the Bniins remain their butter,
but even that appears to be
melting. Budding superstar Glen
Wesley is holding out and says
he'll "play for the Canadian
Olympic Team, which led GM

Harry Sinden to reply, “I’m
actually glad he turned us down,
because Iwas offering too much.”
Bad move, Harry. Wesley is
needed badly, so at least trade
him. But Boston still motors
around on the skatesof all-
everything Ray Bourque and
goalie Andy Moog. Bourque is
the immediate Norris Trophy
favorite, while Moog showed he
was vulnerable in last year’s Wales
Conference Finals, but he remains
excellent. Garry Galley and St.

' Louis pick up Glen Featherstone

to add grit to the defense, but this

group isn’t as deep or as solid as g

in the past years, and Cup hopes
seem dismal.

Up next, the better of two evils,
and I'm picking the hapless
Quebec Nordiques over
Hartford in hopes that the Nords
will deal phenom Eric Lindros
somewhere west (say Winnipeg)
in a massive package and that
John Cullen will hold out all year.
Well, no one wants to‘ play for
Quebec, particularly Lindros.
Since they have been bad for the
last four years, the Nords have
amassed some impressive players.

Joe Sakic is as good as Steve . 

Yzerman, and the rest of the
centers show props. Kip Miller

showed great flashes in only 13 I

games ,and GM Pierre’Page
promises Stephane Morin will

World of football remains the same

Ryan
Buncher

The New Orleans Saints are 5-
0, three games up on the San
Francisco 49ers and the Atlanta
Braves are challenging for the NI.
West title. Jim Everett still hasn’t
thrown a touchdown, but Jim

‘Harbaugh, a quarterback from

Michigan, is one of the top passers
in the NFL, What is going on
here?

Wait a minute. The Tampa Bay
Bucs still stink. Jim McMahon is
injured again. The Steelers are
still playing mediocre football.
Yes, there are still some things in
the sports world that a fan can
count on.

Should the Steelers be written
off as mediocre again? Probably.
Everything that has happened so
far this season points to that.
They are still good enough to
beat weak opponents like San
Diego and New England, but
they just can’t beat the good
teams like Buffalo and
Philadelphia. '

Can they do better? Definitely. ‘

The defense proved it can be one
of the league’s best last year and
could easily get it back together.
The offense is as talented as it has
been in years. One key is to get
rookie receivers Jeff Graham and
Ernie Mills involved. Chris
Callowayand Dwight Stone can

make some big plays on occasion,
but they have been given plenty
of chances to produce
consistently. They just haven’t
done it.

One more thing: a message for
Joe Walton. DON’T KEEP ERIC
GREEN IN TO BLOCK! The guy
was destroying the Eagles’
defense almost single-handedly
and after the Philadelphia defense
adjusted, starting to blitz more,
the Steelers started keeping Green
in to block. Yes, he does look like
another offensive tackle, but he
is also the best offensive weapon
the Steelers have and any offense
that uses him as a blocker is (all
together now) STUPID.

Speaking of guys who look
like offensive linemen, Pittsburgh
seems to need a few more of
those. They are quickly running
out. Misuse of the weapons the
Steelers have is even more
inexcusable because this team
has enough problems on the line
without making more problems
for themselves. Brian Blankenship
may have to retire and deﬁnitely
won’t be back any time soon,
due to a neck injury. His
replacement at right guard, Terry
Long, still faces a possible
suspension for using steroids. The

‘latest problem is the injury that

center Dermonti Dawson suffered
in Philadelphia, which will
probably keep him _out of the
lineup Sunday against the
Indianapolis Colts. His
replacement is 6—foot, 5-inch, 512

pound Mike Withycombe, who
was signed off the waiver wire
two weeks ago to take
Blankenship’s place on the roster.
More important than the lack of a
quality replacement is the loss of
Dawson, the team's best lineman
now that T unch Ilkin is well into
decline. Maybe dumping center
Chuck Lanza and guard John
Rienstra, underachievers who the
team finally lost patience with
but who are better players than
some currently on the roster,
wasn’t such a good idea.

Mayes retired, the Saints can still

score 50 goals. Former No. 1 overalls Mats Sundin (59 points) -
and Owen Nolan are future stars, while Soviet Valeri Kamensky ‘

is signed and rated the world's top prospect next to Lindros.

Goalie Stephane Fiset has talent, but Ron Tugnett held the
team together last season with some impressive play.'The
defense is led by ex-Capital Mikhail Tatarinov, who gets the
reigns on the power play along with" Bryan Fogarty. Curtis
Leschyshyn is coming off surgery, but guess what? He's got
talent.

Eddie Johnston is the Hartford Whalers, and he continues
to ruin the franchise. For the second straight year, the Whalers

finished 19th in the league offensively, and now crafty center F-

John Cullen is holding out. Better give him what he wants, E.J.
At least villain Pat Verbeek decided to report. Rob Brown and
Kevin Dineen add scoring from the wings, while Czech Bobby
Holik must prove his is ready to be a huge contributor.
‘ Zarley Zalapski is the main man on defense, and now is the
time for double Z to show he can run the blueline.
The goaltending is average with, Peter Sidorkiewicz and
prospect Kay Whitmore. Like Quebec, look for the Whalers to
deal like a Vegas pit boss.

Steelers

Continued from page 9
Gill ,Fenerty are both among the
top 10 rushers in the NFC. All are
solid rushers, but the line is the

' consistent factor. '

The other key is the best
linebacking core in the league,

. bar none. Now that Pat Swilling is

getting all the blocking attention,
Rickey Jackson, who some said
was showing signs of age, is back
to his old dominating self. He

 isn’t the best comeback story in

the Big Easy this year; it is the
Cajun Cannon, Bobby Hebert,
coming back strong from a year’s
absence. This team is a real
contender.

-One contender in trouble is
the 49ers. Steve Young was
leading the league in passing
before last Sunday’s game against
the Raiders, but the offense is

 struggling, and the team is 2-3.
~ The acquisition of Tim Harris

from Green Bay makes an
outstanding defense even better
and was a deal they just couldn’t
pass 4 up. Getting Bobby
Humphrey from Denver would
be much more helpful. Waiting
for unproven Ricky Watters when
a proven, quality runner is
available for the reported price of
a No. 1 pick is a mistake. Even if
the Broncos hold out for a
defensive lineman, that is a
position where the 49ers are deep
enough, to give up a player to
help out the Offensejoe Montana,
where are you?

-Guess what? Hockey season
is almost here. The Penguins are
being picked by many to win
theirsecondstraightstanley Cup.
They are hurting themselves by
not signing free—agent center Ron
Francis. With him, the Pens are as
well off at center as any team in

Steelers —

Continued from page 10
the NHL; without him, it becomes
a major area of concern. Mario
Lemieux is back, but missing a
game here and there when he
has back spasms may be a
continuing problem. Brian

‘ Trottier is still solid, but counting

on a player his age to stay healthy
is inviting trouble. The most
damaging loss in personnel in
the off—season was center Randy
Gilhen. That leaves Jiri Hrdina
and Ken Priestlay.

More than that is the team
morale factor. Francis is a solid
veteran and leader. He is very

I necessary to the team, with Coach

Bob Johnson's condition. This is
a disturbing situation for the team
and not a good time for more
problems.

A -It is time for everyone to pick
the postseason awards in baseball.
The AL MVP goes to Frank
Thomas (.318, 31 HR, 107 RBI) of
Chicago, who continued to crush
the ball all season despite being
pitched around all year. The fact
that the White Sox were
contenders and the Orioles
weren’t gives him the edge over
Cal Ripken Jr. (.330, 34, 114). In
the National League, it belongs to

,Barry Bonds (.289, 25, 111).

Defense and stolen bases, 42 of
them, give him the edge over
Terry Pendleton (.313, 20, 79) of
the Braves. ,

Roger Clemens (18-8, 2.38 ERA)
deserves the Cy Young award in
the American League. The other
top pitcher being considered,

‘Scott Erickson (19-7, 3.32), may

not be the best pitcher on the
Twins; that may be Kevin T apani
(16-9, 2.90). In the NL, it comes
down to Tom Glavine (19-11,
2.60) and Jose Rijo (155, 2.32).
Glavine wins it since he pitched
all year, while Rijo missed time
with injuries again. John Smiley
(18-8, 3.25) of Pittsburgh, who
has been the model of consistency
on an erratic staff, and Cards’

closer Lee Smith (45 saves) should

also get consideration.

Rookie of the year in the'

National League will go to Jeff
Bagwell ofHouston (.300, 15, 81)
on his numbers and the fact that

- he played every day. Even though

he platooned at first for the Pirates,
the award should go to Orlando
Merced, (.273,.10, 50) who has
been consistently productive.
The best rookies in the AL both

play for contenders. Second .

baseman Chuck Knobloch of the

, Twins (.285, 1, 48) gets it over

pitcher Julio Guzman (9-2, 3.08)
since he has been there all year
and Guzman was a mid-season

call-up. _
l The Jerk-of—the-Year Award

closes this article, and it is a
three-way tie. One is Otis Nixon
of the Braves, yet another drug
user who may have ruined his
career and his team’s pennant
hopes. The other two are those
twin twit twirlers, Rob Dibble
and Norm Charlton. The Nasty
Boy bit was interesting for a while,
but these guys are dangerous
and should be out of the game.
