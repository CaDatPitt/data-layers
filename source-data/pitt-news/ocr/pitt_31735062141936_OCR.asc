Making a radical departure from
the tapping procedure of past. years,
Omicron Delta Kappa national lion-
orary activities fraternity. will recog-
nize outstanding University meii Mon-
day morning at its regular fall tap-
ping, to be conducted for the first
tinieat an outdoor ceremony,

Absolute secrecy surrounded the
plans for the exercises this week. It
was learned yesterday, however, that
the tapping, beginning promptly at
8:30 o’clock, would take place on the
University lawn between State and
Thaw halls, directly below University
drive.

Election of new members who will
be publicly recognized Monday will
take place Sunday afternoon at a
meeting of active ODK members in
the Faculty club rooms of the Hotel

Victor Gets Prizes

Winner of Game Tomorrow
Receives Three Silver
Cups as Trophies

Award Recalls 1930 Tilt

\Vith no indictments in sight, and
a gullible public lured to a state oi’
mental helplessness by the passing of
the presidential election, the City of
Pittsburgh and the Chamber of Com-
merce can once more consider giving
their animal silver cups to the win-
ner of the Pitt-Tech game. This
year, in addition to the two cups, a
third one will be added to the collec-
tion, that of the Vvarner Brothers.

For the past four or ﬁve years, the
City of Pittsburgh and the Chamber
of Commerce have kept two silver
cups in view for the schools to bat-
tle for, and 1932 marks the ﬁrst year
that the Vvarner Brothers’ Cup has
been offered.

City Offers Cup

The City of Pittsburgh cup is not
a permanent one, but remains in the
possession of the winner for a period
of one year. Continuous winning of
the annual game merely prolongs the
stay of this handsome trophy. The
Chamber of Commerce cup, on the
other hand, becomes the permanent
property of the college winning it for
three successive years. The Warnei'
Brothers’ cup goes to the winner of

Tech is making only one——and that
through force of circumstances.
Spisak last week was injured in the
Xavier game, but in his place Bob
Waddell is starting Tom Coulter,
which ‘doesn't subtract a thing from
'J‘ecli’s chances. ,

Pa Pitt will sit on tlie,.edge of his
Stadium seat in watching his two
boys contest each other’s right to be
called football champion of the City
of ‘Pittsburgh, with his Tartan son
sitting up- nights thinking new argu-
inents—passing arguments. The '1‘ar-
tans have always been more eifective
in completing passes than their
Panther brethren the latter using
straight force in subduing their Skibo
rivals, and tomorrow’s game will be
“pass” against “push.”

Even with almost zero weather pre-
dicted for tomorrow’s game, after the
ﬁrst few plays. there will be very lit-
tle need of extra blankets, tliere’ll be
too much action to sit quiet and take
things easy.

 

Swim Season

To Open Soon

Natators Drill ln Preparation
For Yale, Harvard Meets

Confronted by the iieariiess of the
importaiit Yale and Harvard swim-
ming meets, an unusual amount of
activity may be observed at Trees
pool by anyone interested enough to
investigate.

Practices lia.ve been lengthened.
and the swimmers are splashing off
close to a mile ea.ch day in addition
to their regular workouts. The squad
will return to shorter distances and
concentrate on the racing end of the
meets in a few days. It is hoped that
the long distance workouts will en-
able the swimmers to obtain better
coordination and wind for'the shorter
dashes.

Departing from his usual custom of
coaching, Coach Corr is engaging in
daily workouts with the team in the
pool. hoping by this to obtain a bet-
ter view of the faults and make it
easier to correct them.

A distinct surprise this week came
in the aniiouncemeiit by Captain
Herman Adlersberg that he was a
candidate for the breast stroke, ll‘l
addition to his regular duties as a
free style artist. Adlersbcrg showed
deﬁnite promise in the breast stroke
b_v defeating Joe Schmieler, veteran
swimmer, in the trials Tuesday night.

Several frosh prospects were uii-
covered by assistaiit swimming coach
George Lee while watcliing the swim-
mers in his advanced classes. These
swiinmcrs, after regular workouts,
are expected to play a big part in the
success of the fresh swimming team.

Special attention is being paid to
the divers this week. A few free
style artists are being groomed to
take up the diving duties. Of these,
Rugli, free styler on the freshman
team, shows most promise.

At present, Stiiiner, Reilly, Denny.
Lewis. Norton, and Captain Adlers-
berg have shown the best times in
the dashes. Cogswell, varsity mid-
dle-distance star, seems headed for
the top if his time trials can be taken
 a. criterion of his work.

In the brea.st stroke, Coach C01‘l‘
has little to worry about when he
looks over the imposing list of talent
that includes Joe Sclimieler, Robbins.
and Captain Adlersberg. As usual,
Carik seems a certain point winner
in the diving events.

Sixty Boxers

 

Liglit Squad Will Represent
Pitt ln Ring '

Despite the fact that the number of
applicants for positions on the boxing
team i_s increasing daily, the, great’
majority are freshmen, and tlierefore
are not eligible for varsity competi-
tion. . .

The list of candidates numbers well
over sixty, and to care for all of them,
a new system of training will be car-
ried out this year by Coach Orsini.
Every candidate will be given careful
coaching, and where school work con-
flicts with the regular workouts, the
prospective boxer will be given in-
struction during his free periods.

The majority of the freshnien will
be under the care of upperclassmen
who have had previous boxing experi-
ence. Each experienced man will
have charge of a small group and will
be personally responsible for their
preliminai'y training.

Light workouts will occupy the ma-
jor portion of the time at Trees gym,
but it is quite likely that heavier
training will be in order shortly after
the squad takes up training quarters
in the stadium. Equipment has been
passed out to the ina.jority of the box-
ing candidates, and instruction will
be given them early next week on the
basic fundamentals.

A glance at the material on hand at
the present would lead one to sus-
pect that something is wrong with the
heavier men. The majority are in the
lighter classes, ranging from 118 to
150 pounds.

Last year Pitt had trouble in pro-
viding a. boxer in the bantamweiglit,
or 118-pound class, and Coach Orsini
intends to see that this situation is
remedied when the gong rings for the
ﬁrst match of the season. It is possi-
ble that Harry Coiiti, the crooning
wonder, may come down to 119 pounds
in order to ﬁght in this class. Last
season Conti fought in the 125-pound
class, and frequently entered the ring
with a ten-pound disadvantage.

Wlien is a football player not a
football player? The answer is-
wlien he’s a ﬁreman. This is not
a riddle, but merely a description
of how twenty-ﬁve boys playing
football on the ﬁeld in front of

Trees gym Monday afternoon
quit their game to put out a. ﬁre
which had caught the straw stack
there.

Although the cause of the ﬁre
is not exactly known, it is sus-

pected that several boys, who
were loitering behind the stack
were responsible. Immediately

after the ﬂames were noticed, the
suspects “hastily put plenty of
space between them and the scene
of their crime,” and when they
were last seen, they had their
hands full trying to keep out of
the clutches of a couple of metal-
lurgy students who were chasing
them.

Despite the fact that the ﬁre
ﬁghters tried to smother the
ﬂames with their sweat-shirts and
stamp it down with their feet,
they were unable to check the
fire until extinguishers were
brought from the School of Mines
and from Trees gym. Half an
hour after the ﬁre started, it was
quenched, and the boys resumed
their game. The only damage
was—a slightly singed straw
stack, and the loss of a perfectly
good backboard for the archers.

BITS 

"Pinny" Heller

I

      

After a two-weeks’ layoff, because
of political gasbags, the “A1l-Ameri-
can”, program took to the ether again,
and almost gave Pitt an even break.

Thirty collegians were men-
tioned for‘“iAl|-American" ratings
and the only Pitt man among
them was Warren Hell‘er., who was
receiving his second award. Per.
sonally, I think the boys in
charge are either afraid of men-
tioning two players from the
same college in one night or just
don't like a gentleman by the
name of “Muggsy” Skladany.

It is also interesting to consider the
case of %.———-—~. Whi1e« Pitt stu-
dents were celebrating the Notre
Dame victory by leaving their classes,
one prof. refused to dismiss his stu-
dents, who thereupon left of their own
accord. That is, all the students ex-
cept Vvarren Heller left, and the re-
mainder of the lecture was given to
Heller alone. .

Any argument ~ about training
brings to mind the story of Jack
Schricker, who happens to be the
eastern conference 155-pound box-
ing champ. While refereeing a
sand lot football "game, one of his

decisions concerning penalties

was objected to by a mere .200.

pounder who showed his displeas.

A beautiful left hook necessitated

time being taken to revive the

heavyweight. . '

It seems foolish to install Pitt as
the favorite in the remainder of the
games this season simply because-the
team happened to defeat Notre Dame,
Anyone who has nerve enough to in-
stall either team as the favorite for
tomorrow’s game is taking a big
chance.

With "all the college songs that
are being murdered by various ra-
dio artists, it seems strange that
Pitt has not been mentioned in any

_of them. “All.American Girl,"

“Anybody’s College Song," and

good old “Betty Coed” went their

way mentioning practically every
college in the country but Pitt.

The Pitt band, 120 pieces, will un-
doubtedly increase its popularity with
the Pitt student body if the little skit
planned for tomorrow’s game is car-
ried out. Tech students. on the other
hand, will not take kindly to the ‘lit-
tle drama. .

ODAY we honor a man whose interests and achievements, year
after year, have added much to the life enjoyed by students at

the University.

At the suggestion of its president, Student Council has called a
special testimonial assembly, so that every undergraduate may pay
his personal tribute to Dr. John B. Sutherland, successful varsity

football coach and a distinguished member of the Dental School ._ _ _
lising much ado about art IS a neces-

faculty.

An alumnus of the University himself, “J ock”--as he is known
to all who have ever heard his name——has grown with the student
body and the institution, until today he and his Alma Mater occupy
positions of national prominence. There can be no denying his con-
tribution to the increased prestige of the University in the last
decade.
as an athletic adviser and coach.

Most of us know “Jock” only as a public ﬁgure, the subject of
sports comment in newspaper columns the country over. VVe liaiib
been denied the personal, n1an—to-man contacts enjoyed by students
in the Dental School and members of the football squad. And,
frankly, we envy those groups for the privilege they hold.

All that has been said in praise of Dr. Sutherland we feel as
keenly as do his more active associates. It is in the hope that we
may make seine public expression of our regard and appreciation
that we assemble today in Memorial Hall.

Panther and Tartan

N SPITE of cold weather and the accompanying prospects of a
relatively small attendance, enthusiasm over toniori-ow’s contest

;in the Stadium is at its usual peak.

Doggedly intent upon upsetting pre-ganie predictions by defeat-
ing Dr. Sutherlancl’s Golden Panthers, Carnegie Tech enters the
eighteenth contest between the two institutions in a frame of mind
which promises something more than “just another football game”
for the spectators. Pitt—’l‘ech rivalry, always evidenced in the reac-
tions of the team followers, this year is heightened by the standings
of the two teams.

How the bagpipes would shrill over a Tartan victory! And
how the Panther and all his hangers-on would dance over a Tartan
defeat! That, we hope, is as far as the celebrations would go on
either side. .

Relations between the two student bodies have been above re-
proach in the past few seasons. There is no reason why the friendly
rivalry and traditional sportsmanship so evident on the playing ﬁeld
should not continue to exist between the student supporters them-
selves.

Likewise, it is hardly necessary to trace his climb to fame {Called a metallic technique_ of course’

Not Exactly News

66 E\VARE of the man with the vegetables and camera!” is our
warning to women students who have no desire to ﬁgure in

manufactured “news” stories or to pose for press photographs of a
cheap and trivial nature.

Complaints lodged with the University by the parents of sev-
eral women undergraduates who recently were the subjects of a

“story” procured by an over-zealous reporter from a downtown

newspaper, lead us to believe that it is about time for a reconsidera-
tion of what constitutes news and “1egitiinate” publicity.

A reliable source informs us that the above-mentioned women,
approached on the campus, were handed a large and cumbersome
vegetable and then were asked to pose for a press protograph. About
this incident was written a harmless, but nevertheless untrue, feat-
ure story.

This particular case corresponds to others, similarly liarmless,
which have occurred from time to time in the past. We feel that
such publicity does anything but promote the welfare of the Uni-
versity. Certainly it does not speak well for the intellectual capac-
ity of the individual members of our student body.

In an institution of higher learning, supposedly a center of in-
tellect, and of artistic and scientiﬁc achievement, there are things
of more interest to the public we hope——tlian silk-clad legs and
meaningless individual opinions on meaningless trivial subjects.

Paintings are especially apt in au-
tumn. Then the bright leaves are
fallen, and we must look inside for
color, to books, to warm, twinkling
tires, and to pictures we have never
got around to before. It was pleasant

last Wednesday to slip out of the
rain into the Carnegie Galleries.
Here, in the Exhibition of Interna-
‘tional‘Pain'tings in Pitilsburgli and
the Carnegie Tech Alumni Exhibition,
was all the color one could want, as
well as enough interest and variety
to keep the whole afternoon pleasant.

In looking ba.ck over examples of
the thirty International Exhibitions,
one realizes the stretch of time that
has elapsed. Artists who won repute
in the early years of the century now
seem pushed off from us, only dimly
signiﬁcant. This is the feeling about
Alma-'l‘adema,. for instance, whose
work one thinks of as having long
been hung at the back ends of gal-
leries. Certainly the accent varies
all the way through, and it is no mere
chance that as we coiue toward the
recent eizhibitions our interest grows.
More force is evident, more stir. Of
course, there is more blundering, as
expected, but after all, a more prom-

sary step in moving from old flatness
to a new vitality.
More Recent Work

There are quite a number of pie-
tures from recent exhibitions, old
friends a_iid animosities, though real-
ly few of the ones we especially like
are hung. There is the interesting
Polish Nude, done in what might be

Susanna, last season's. popular prize
winner, assumes a prominent place,
as does Watkins’ controversial Sui-
cide ln Costume.

Something more pleasant and inti-
mate comes from the Tech Exliibi-
tion. That many of the artists are
familiar has something to do with it.
But above that, there is a quality of
sound experimeiitation, sureness, sin-
cerity that makes the whole ratlier
satisfying. In his unusual composi-
tions, Russel G. Twiggs is doing work
of the more radical sort. The ab-
stractions of Riggs are more sanely
arrived at, and his work has a gen-
uine feeling for form and we1l-consid-
cred composition. Bob Young has a
landscape and two excellent portraits
of women. A number of Petrovitz’s
things are hung, most of them rather
somber and heavy, usually centered
about muddy yellows and deep
browns. A few of the sketches and
drawings we like especially; Lillian
Kimball‘s portraits were outstanding.

Academi Group

An exhibition that some of the
younger artists have been consider-
ing for over a month now is going
to be held at last. This time it is the
Academi Group who are sponsoring
a four-man show of the work of
Charles Errett McCurdy, Charles W.
Brown, Joseph Schwarz, and J. Wes-
ley Snyder on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the
Union Trust Building. It will open
Monday. All four of these artists are
doing work of the more modern sort,
and they show obvious promise in a
sound approach and execution. Cer-
tainly this exhibition ought to be one
of the most interesting items of the
month.

And Heifetz

Not that we ought to spend all our
time in the galleries. There is the
Heifetz recital Monday evening. Most
music critics are eager in pronounc-
,ing'Heifetz one of the signiﬁcant vio-
Few artists of
the Pittsburgh concert season, to be
sure, have enjoyed the continued at-
tendance he has. His ﬁnished classic
execution and his ability to commu-
nicate feeling make us look forward
to him from year to year. And the
program is always excellently varied.

teau Thierry, in Monday morning
8:30’s, and in correcting examination
papers; not to mention the trials of
an interview by a News reporter.
For tonight they will meet Jolinny’s
papa and Sally’s mamma, along with
divers and sundry Aunt Bessies and

Uncle Pliils at the Cliancel1or’s recep-I
tion for parents "of f-i'eshn'ien.

Through more than seven weeks
they have watched the ﬁrst year stu-
dents troop into classes, play with all:

physics apparatus which might unfor-
tunately be exposed, shake dirty-look-
ing bottles in chemistry labs, bottles,

which might contain the results of an ;
upperclassman’s labor and research,i
chip initials in the woodwork with
penknives, sleep, come in late, hold
hands, do any number of the things
freshmen usually do; and the majority
of them are totally and completely
unknown to those in charge of the
classes. except as names on examina-
tion papers.

Especially will any whose freshman
classes are run on a straight lecture
and quiz basis with little or no recita-
tion be at a disadvantage tonight when
the mother of that budding genius
from McKees Rocks or the one from
Mount Lebanon picks him from the]
groups, walks up and coos, “And howl
is Jainesie doing in your class, Pro-i
fessor?” Some of. the faculty con-i
ﬁded that they look forward to scenes l
like this: ;

“Oh yes, uh—Jam'es-uh-wliy he’s do-,

ing quite nicely. (Which one isl
James Brown in. that confoundedl
class?) Oh yes, very well indeed. In‘

fact, if everyone in the class adapted,
himself nearly as -well, it would be;
quite an ideal one toteach.” }

“My, how nice. But professor, wliyi
is .Iamesie’s grade’ only a D‘? Youi
know, in high school. Jamesie neverl
had lower than an A!” 

“VVell—uli-James has the ability, Ii
think, uh-but well, he’s a little younger’
than the rest of the class, and, after:
he develops and matures just a little
bit, he should get along much better.”
(Boy, is that getting out?)

“But Professor, llaiiiesie has been.
out of school three years; he surely
can't be that inucli younger-than the
others.” '

(Biisiiiess of the professor seeing
somebody; “will you. pardon me for
Just a minute?”)

Not only are faculty members fear-g
fully awaiting tliereceptioii, but there g
are also the freshmen themselves to}
consider. Besides the fact that there
will be food which the freshmen won’t I
be able to get at, there is also that?
little thing——grades. Eddie’s ﬂunk ini
matliematics will ‘come out at tliatl
time as will Josepliine’s unsatisfac-l
tory mark in zoology. And one of the{
greatest catastrophes of the affairi
will be when the parents of the infant 4
protege from Mount Laffee learn the!
harsh facts, the facts that the poor;
boy has been tearfully coiiﬁding alli
week to intimates: He has only
drawn three A's; the fourth mark is,
alas, a B plus. Woe is us.

FOUND!

King Lear, Chaucer Wend
Their Weary Way To
Clearing House

 

The lost and found department re-
ports a variety of lost articles in
their custody. King Lear and Chau-
cer, tattered texts, are reposing
peacefully there among their humble

' surroundings.

The instructors in Alumni, Thaw,
State, and Memorial halls complain
that they are kept busy returning lost
articles to the University's clearing
house. Waiting there now are:
three girls’ bracelets; six books, one
black brief case; one ear-ring; three

.-pairs of gloves; two men's felt hats;

two keys; three note-books; four
fountain pens; two eversharp pen-
cils; oiie,woman’s purse; one frater-
nity pin; one brown scarf; two um-
brellas. A Wilkinsburg high school
pin has also found its way to this de-
partment of orphan articles.

If any of you faithful readers rec-
nize one of these articles as your
own, won’t you please claim it?

Another big College Associa-
tion formal, to which the gay lads
and lassies can come in all their
finery and dance up an appetite
for a Thanksgiving turkey, will
bob up on the University social
calender the night of November
23. Again, the officers of the as-
sociation are more worried about
trying to keep the younger gen-
eration away than they are in en-
ticing them to the mirrored ball-
room. B-illy VVeixel, the enthu-
siastic young musician whose or-
chestra is now an institution at
Bemus Point on Lake Erie during
the summer months, will fur-
nish the rhythm while the coeds
parade the handsome escorts up
and down the hall.

Jack Hunger, Col. '34, treasurer
of the College Association,
wishes to inform any misguided
undergraduates that member-
ships are not now selling at the
bargain price of $1.00 as the
News proclaimed on November 8,

but that a limited number are
still available at twice that
amount.

Admission to the dances, Mr.
Hunger says, is not upon the
purchase of a ticket,‘ as is -the
case with other University
dances, but upon presentation of
the membership card. The Asso-
ciatioii, a non-proﬁt organization,
can therefore limit the at-
tendance at its affairs so as to
make the evening more pleasant
for the guests.
