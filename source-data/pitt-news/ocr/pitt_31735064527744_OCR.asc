A new overnight extended-
guest policy will be implemented
in the residence halls on Feb. 4.
This policy will allow members
of the opposite sex to stay
overnight Monday through
Friday.

The policy is being conducted
on a trial basis, and if it is

successful this term, it will be
retained, according to Douglas
M. Posey, assistant director of the
Office of Residence Life.

“I think it will work out,” said
Posey.

Last fall the Student
Government Board and the
Resident Student Association
conducted a survey that resulted
in a decision to consider changing
the overnight extended-guest

policy.

The former policy stated that
members of the opposite sex
were allowed to stay in the
residence halls until 2 a.m., during
the week and overnight on
weekends.

Students will now be able to
have guests of the opposite sex
stay overnight on any day. A
strident will have to obtain the
approval of any roommates, have

the guest fill out an extended-
guest form and have the guest
provide identiﬁcation.

“lt’s a good idea. We have guys

on our ﬂoor anyhow,” said junior '

Melissa Wilson.

“It’s not that bad,” said senior
David Hasenkopf.

“Roommates have to ﬁgure that
out on their own, on an individual
basis. [The university is] getting a
little liberal now,” said

Hasenkopf.

After the results of the SGB
survey were determined, a
committee of students and staff
was formed to explore the
feasibility of a new residence-
hall procedure, according to
Posey.

Security was a major issue, he
said.

“It's both a privilege and a
responsibility,” said Posey.

Inter-Fratemity Council judicial-
board members were elected and
officers were appointed at an IFC
meeting Tuesday.

Doug Doerfler of Phi Gamma
Delta and Rick Laughlin of Kappa
Sigma defeated Andy Helmer of
Sigma Chi and Tony Demarino of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon for the two
senior justice positions on the
IFC judicial board.

Doerfler said that he wants to
focus on constructive
punishments for fraternities who
disobey the bylaws of the IFC. “I
think closed-mindedness is a
deterrent. I want to focus on
constructive punishment.

“I want to work with the
executive board, if possible, to
enforce the policies of the IFC
and set aside time for the justices
to go to the houses and correct
things that may become
problems," Doerfler said.

Laughlin, who served as a junior
justice on lastyear’s judicial board,
said that he would like to speed
up the judicial-board process and
possibly meet with the
Panhellenic judicial board on
various matters.

Tommy Reinhold, Pi Kappa
Alpha; Jeremy Weis, Pi Lambda
Phi; John Miceli, Sigma Chi; and
Anthony Guazo, Delta Sigma Phi,
were nominated for the positions
of junior justices.

Reinhold and Weis were elected

to the positions. Reinhold said
that he aims to avoid dissent
among fraternities.

“I want to work with the houses
and try to make sure that they are
working better to follow the
bylaws,” he said.

Weis said that he is interested
in adding new blood to the judicial
board.

“I feel it is the position of the
judicial board to induce
punishments, but we are all
Greeks, and we make mistakes
sometimes. I don’t see this
position as one that is to be used
to back-stab fraternities,” he said.

Ian Fischer, Theta Chi, defeated
Brian Bender, Delta Tau Delta,
for the position of sophomore
justice.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, January 24, 1991
 

New IFC judicial board stresses constructive punishment

“I don’t believe in the use of
probation because it serves no
purpose,” Fisher said. “I do not
favor the use of fines because it
says that you can screw up as
long as you have the money to
buy your way out. I favor
community service as a
constructive form of punishment
because it benefits the
community,” Fisher said.

John Demming was appointed
to the position of external vice
president, and Randy Patrinos
was appointed to the position of
secretary. These appointments
were made by Darin McMullen,
IFC president, and ratified by the
house presidents and
representatives present at the

He said the problem of the
university’s budget shortfall for
next year is an “immediate one
that is going to face all parts ofthe

Despite the problems, ULS is
maintaining its position in the

Galpern said, “A lot of university

He thinks this is a dangerous
trend because “if you don’t keep

Jan. 23 —— Police responded to
a complaint of loud music coming
from an apartment in North
Oakland. When officers arrived
at the scene, they could hear the
music from the street. The student
was asked to turn the music down
but turned it back up when the
police left. After another
complaint, police returned to the
scene. The music was turned up
again when the police left. Police
reports said the suspect was very
intoxicated. Police issued a
citation to the student for
disorderly conduct.

Jan. 22 —— A videocassette
recorder was stolen from the
Learning Research and
Development Center. The police
reported that the door was

“secured before and after the theft.

Jan. 22 — A fire alarm was
activated in the Towers laundry
room. A student had left his
laundry in a dryer, and when he
returned, his towel was
completely burned.

Jan. 22 —-— Your Campus Store
notified police of a possible book
theft. A male and female brought

Caparelli added that the
Middle East war has caused
a change in policy
regarding bomb threats.

“We get a lot of crank
calls threatening that a
bomb will go off, but with
all the trouble lately, any
kind of bomb threat we
receive now we will take
seriously,” said Caparelli.

Jim Godfrey, a guard at
Hillman Library, thought it
was very possible that there
was actually a bomb in the
library.

“Sure, I thought it was
possible. There may be
some questions about
probability, but it is
certainly possible,” said

Godfrey.
Steve Ricciutti, an
Hillman Library employee,

wasn’t surprised by the
bomb threat.

“Now, more than any
other time, a bomb threat
could be likely. There is
definitely more merit to it.
Whoever did it certainly
was timely,” said Ricciutti.

Pitt couldn’t maintain that
position.

“Eight or 10 years ago we were
no longer one of the few
[universities] recruiting black
students,” he said. “Other
universities had more money and
better locations, which took a toll
on Pitt’s minority enrollment.”

Pitt is also not actively recruiting
African—Americans, said Daniel.

“We don’t have the competitive
scholarships or the commitment
of the professors to recruit and
make our departments appealing
to African-American students,”
Daniel said.

He cited the music department
at Pitt as an example. Ten years
ago there were 10 African-
American graduate students. Now
there is one: Clifford Sykes.

“Pitt can do things that don't
cost a lot of money to make the
situation at least suitable,” Sykes
said. “I left a job teaching [where

Now Sykes is progressing under
Nathan Davis, Ph.D., in the music
department, but Sykes said that
he had to work hard and show
his dedication.

Davis said the reason for the
decline in his department is that
emphasis was taken from Afro-
centric and other world- music
programs and placed on an
overall academic study of music.

“It defeats the purpose of
graduate study,” Davis said. “In

They're doing it all wrong. ..

As the world focuses on the war in the Persian Gulf,

another major power is losing more and more support

inside its own borders.
The Soviet Union's problems have been mounting for

‘ the past two years. First it lost its system of satellites in

Eastern Europe — some peacefully, as in Poland, and
others not so peacefully, as in Romania.

Then the Soviet economy fell off the face of every scale,
putting the Soviet Union in a state of near-depression.
Food supplies dwindled from lack of coordination, not
lack of supplies. People formed bread lines in October,

- _ something that has not happened there since 1917, when

the Bolsheviks came to power. , I
Now Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev faces yet

I another dilemma: the prospect of losing his republics to

independence.
Two weeks ago Soviet troops invaded a television

~ station in Vilnius, Lithuania. Fourteen people were killed

in the raid, one of whom was a small child who was run
over by a tank. Riots continue to break out in the state on
-a constant basis.

The Soviets have also sent more troops into Latvia. Many
Latvians fear a occurrence similar to the one in Lithuania.
This threat, however, has not diminished their ideas of
independence. ‘

Gorbachev’s country has many problems within its
system. Nine of the 15 republics within the Soviet Union
have declared some measure of sovereignty. Because of
this unique problem, Gorbachev must decide how to
keep the country together, especially in these harsh
economic times.

All countries in the world have the right to keep their
nations intact. In doing this, they must sometimes put
down revolutions from within to keep the sanctity of the
union. The United States has had to do this in its past, with
the attempted secession of the South in the 18605.

This is exactly what is happening in the Soviet Union.
Gorbachev has tried to deal with the Baltic republics. Last
year he threatened to cut off all supplies to Lithuania
when it declared its sovereignty. Though this worked for
a while, it didnot disenchant the Lithuanians, and their

, drive for independence continued.

So Gorbachev decided that his only other option was to
deny them their independence by force. Unfortunately,
that force cost 14 people their lives and could cost many
more in the near future.

To maintain his power in the Soviet Union, Gorbachev
must keep the country unified. However, there can be a
peaceful resolution to the situation. If the Soviets want to
keep their country intact, then they must seek that

resolution. Violence will only enhance the drive for
independence. ‘

I suppose you’ve heard the
news. We’ve attacked Iraq after
saying we’re mad as hell and not
going to take it anymore. Like
everyone else, I listened to the
delirious ramblings of a sleepy
Bernard Shaw and watched barely
comprehensible war footage
(which was exciting, I must
admit). ‘

Nonetheless, I began to feel as
if nothing was going on in the
world but a relentless air attack
(that someone decided to call a
‘.‘war”) on that bad boy of

Baghdad, Saddam Hussein. Every '

other news event has fallen into
obscurity.

However, this is not the whole
story. There is today, as there
always has been and always will
be, a myriad of events any hungry
journalist can choose from:
Southeast Asia is in more or less
the same state of chaos we left it
in 1975; the Soviets added Latvia
to their hit list, and Liberia is no
better off than before its civil war.

If the media bombardment of
Iraq is disturbing, try to
understand —— the last time they
had a chance to saturate a topic
this badly was when all the Eastern
European nations threw down
their sickles and replaced badly
managed totalitarian regimes with
hopelessly incompetent dem-
ocracies. Back then, even the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette had its
own “Eastern Europe” news page.

US. not just ﬁghting for oil in Gulf

I was discharged from the Army
in November and am a veteran
of the last armed conﬂict which
the United States was involved
with (Panama).

I can’t believe that the students, peace activists
and media, including The Pitt News, have ignored

many of the issues.

The U.S. is not in the Persian Gulf just because
of oil. The United States would have still gotten oil
from the region even if Kuwait had invited Iraq to
annex it. The U.S. is fighting dictatorship for the
freedom of a nation. The media have been too
quick to forget what Iraq's troops did when they

All of the good stories are gone

Adam
Richter

But let’s face it. That was a long
time ago, and according to most
reputable (and not-so-reputable)
news sources, practically the only
thing going on is the “war” in
Iraq. When media saturation gets
to this kind of high, I just have to
ask myself: What would
tomorrow's journalists think?

It seems as if all the best news
stories have passed the new
generation of reporters by. If the
powers that be aren’t careful,
they just might give the impression
to these future Dan Rathers and
Cokie Roberts that nothing is
going on in the world. A

According to how the war is
being covered, once today’s high
school Gazetteers graduate into
the real world, it seems that they
will have nothing to do but what
today’s journalists already do
plenty of: drink.

Unfortunately, this is exactly
the impression given to today’s
Gazette reporters. The well of
news seems to have dried up.

After all, the generation of
budding reporters in high schools
and colleges today missed out on
a lot of great news stories, like
Iran (the first hostage crisis),
Brezhnev, Cambodia, El Salvador

Letters

(again, I mean the first time
around) and the Reverend Jim
Jones mess. Most high school
kids have missed out on some of
the best stories of the past decade,
covering instead student—counci1
elections and interviewing the
bowling—team coach.

While they were busy covering
stories like these, apparently all
the best hell holes in the world
have frozen over. Communism
isn’t even fun to write about.

It is important to remember,
however, in times of insufferable
hardship (and listening 24 hours
a day to news dealing exclusively
with the Middle East certainly
qualifies), it is important to look
on the bright side.

Look at it this way: Over the
next several months, we will learn
every unimportant, trivial and
irrelevant fact about Iraq, Kuwait
and every other country south of
Turkey that we ever wanted to
know — and more. Meanwhile,
the dwindling U.S. economy will
hit the back burners (or back
pages, as the case may be), as
will any story that breaks around
the world that has merit but has
nothing to do with the war.

So the question remains: How
do you find out about the non-
Iraq events going on in the world?

I recommend your high school

(11—5, 5-3) have struggled,
recording road losses to Villanova
and Providence. The Hoyas also
lost to Syracuse Monday night at
the Capital Centre, a game in
which Mourning recorded nine
points in 24 minutes of action.

Mourning “should play from
here on out, getting more playing
time as he gets himself back into
shape," according to Bill
Shapland, Georgetown’s director
of information for basketball.

Shapland added that
Mourning’s rehabilitation was
complete, but that there were no
guarantees that he would be in
normal playing condition by
Sunday.

Mourning’s partner inside is
Dikembe Mutombo, who
currently ranks among the league
leaders in field—goal percentage

‘St. John’s Express rolls over Women’s hoopteam

By Rob Mazur
Sta_ﬁ“ Writer

All of the elements were there for a Lady Panther win over the St.
John’s Express at the Fitzgerald Field House last night.

Lorri Johnson was honored before the game for scoring 2,000
career points and becoming the all-time leading scorer in the Big East.
The team was riding a four-game winning streak, three of those wins
coming on the road. The Lady Panthers were off to their best start in
the Big East in almost six years. However, fate would not have it,
and the Express handed the Lady Panthers their second Big East loss
of the season, 68-56. The loss dropped the Lady Panthers to 10-8
overall and 5-2 in the Big East, while the Express improved its season
mark to 12-6 and 6-2 in the conference.

All season, Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce has complained of his team’s
inconsistency from the free-throw line. The Lady Panthers have shot
a respectable .675 from the line, but they go cold in some games and
miss crucial shots.

Inconsistency was not the trouble. The problem was the low
number of foul shots the Lady Panthers had compared with the
Express. While Pitt attempted eight shots and hit six, St. John’s
attempted 19 of 31 (17-25 in the second half). That difference proved
to be enough to win the game.

“You can't blame a loss on the officials [for calling more fouls on
one team than another],” said Bruce. “You really have to give a lot of
credit to St. John’s. They came here ready to play today. Cozette
Ballentine is really playing great. She had a super game tonight.”
Ballentine had 28 points and 18 rebounds. Ten of those rebounds
came on the offensive glass.

The Express out—rebounded Pitt 49-40 (21-12 in offensively).

“The big difference in the game was the offensive rebounds. When
the other team gets an offensive board, four things can happen, and
three of them are bad. They can score; they can take another shot,
or they can keep the ball,” said Bruce.

“Normally, we have at least four players score in double figures. If

and is first in blocked shots, averaging nearly five per game.
Mutombo has also raised his scoring average to almost 20 points
per game in Big East games.

Aside from those two familiar faces, the Hoyas are a brand
new team with seven newcomers. Yet even with all the new
faces, Georgetown is not a deep team.

Three players transferred after last year, and two more
(sophomores Antoine Stoudamire and Mike Sabol) have left
school this season, leaving Thompson bereft of experience in
the backcourt and at small forward.

This lack of experience has forced the Hoyas to start three
freshmen at times. Robert Churchwell, a 6—foot—6 forward, has
been a steady contributor, averaging 16 points per game. The
Big East Rookie of the Week last week, Churchwell also ranks
among the Big East leaders in field—goal percentage, shooting
at a 58.S—percent clip.

But shooting has been a real problem for Georgetown, as the
team is shooting 24.8 percent from beyond the three—point line
and only 16.2 percent in conference play. Even inside the 19-
foot—9-inch line, the Hoyas don’t shoot very well. Despite the
accuracy of Mutombo and Churchwell, the team makes less
than 43 percent of its shots.

In spite of all the new faces, offensive woes and injury
problems, the Hoyas still play their signature tight defense,
leading the nation in ﬁeld-goal percentage defense at .352.

Seemingly gone, however, is the running game. Only once
this season have the Hoyas topped the 100-point mark, a 110-
77 victory at the expense of Hawaii-Loa. Since then, Georgetown
has not scored 80 points in a game.

Continued from page 5
three offensive rebounds into
eight points and cutting the
Panthers’ lead to 12—10.

From there, Pitt’s man—to—man
defense forced Providence to rush
its shots as the Panthers stretched
their lead to 33-16 with seven
minutes left in the half. During
the 21-6 run, the frontcourt of
Morningstar, Shorter and Porter
accounted for 19 points, as the
Panthers executed well in the
half-court offense.

Murdock took over for the Friars
late in the half, scoring six points,

two steals and an assist, bringing
Providence to 40-30, within 10 at
the half. Murdock led all scorers
at the half with 15, while
Morningstar paced Pitt with nine
points.

Almost completely absent in
the first half was the pressing
defenses both teams unveiled in
previous games. Providence’s
press was broken easily by Miller,
while Pitt barely used the press.

Providence opened the second
half in a fullcourt press, attempting
to speed up the tempo. Murdock
keyed the Friar attack with four

straight layups, cutting the lead
to 42-58. Murdock continued to
put on his show, adding seven
more points, two assists and a
steal, but Pitt held a 59-52 lead
with 11:44 remaining.

Morningstar and Matthews
shined for Pitt early in the second
half. Morningstar put back several
offensive rebounds, helping Pitt
maintain a 66-56 lead at the 9-
minute mark. Matthews scored
nine of Pitt’s next 11 in an 11-5
spurt which gave the Panthers a
77-61 lead with under seven
minutes left to play.

Women

Continued from page 5
you go back and look at our [last]
couple of wins, we have four
people with 10 points or better.
Tonight, we only had two players
score 10 points or more. Lorri
Johnson had 22 points, andJonna
Huemrich had 10. We need to
have more people score more
points if we are going to win, “ he
said.

The Lady Panthers need to

continue their momentum for
Saturday’s showdown against the
No. 18-ranked Connecticut
Huskies.

“This is going to be a big game
for us. Connecticut is a smaller
team than us, but they are very
scrappy and quick. They are all
great shooters,” said Bruce.

Pitt and UConn will tip it off
Saturday at 2 p.m., at Fitzgerald

Field House.

PI'IT BITS: Johnson led Pitt
with 22 points and 13 rebounds.
Following her were Huemrich
with 10 points and seven
rebounds . . . Johnson was not the
only Lady Panther, to pass a
milestone — senior center Connie
Hurt passed the 970—point mark
in the first half, moving her up to
seventh place on the Pitt all—time
career scoring list.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 24,

 

Robert Altman brings

By Dmitri Ragano
Sbowcase Editor

There’s nothing in art more
legendary than the story of
Vincent van Gogh. We’ve all
heard that he cut off his ear.
We’ve seen his amazing
paintings, which sell for $50
million nowadays. And we all
know that even his brother Theo,
an art dealer, couldn’t sell
Vincent’s work. Van Gogh
committed suicide at age 37,
penniless and unrecognized.

In death, van Gogh became
the prototype for the 20th-century
artist—- the man whose suffering
and creativity fed each other.
Van Gogh’s uncanny
combination of love, talent, ego
and craziness made him a

legendary figure in the public
eye. The man made art a religion:
more important than money,
more important than society,
more important than life.

When ﬁlmmaker Robert Altman
tackled the lofty van Gogh legend
in Vincent and Theo, which is
playing at the Fulton through
Feb. 7, he must have known he
had his work cut out for him. But
then, Altman is no ordinary
director. In the ’70s, he and men
like Francis Ford Coppola and
Martin Scorsese changed
American cinema. Like these
mavericks, Altman tried to buck
Hollywood by making daring,
personal “art” films like MASH, the
classic western McCabe and M rs.
Millerand Nashville, a sprawling
essay on country music and

politics. Selling tickets was the
one art Altman couldn’t master.
And after enough misconceived
big— budget bombs (like Popeye),
the director was deemed a crazy
man and run out of Hollywood.

“He’s studying the art of
business, and I’m studying the
business of art,” said Theo van
Gogh of himself and his brother.
This aptly applies to Altman. The
filmmaker embodies the
paradoxes of art and business,
genius and madness — he’s
perfect for the van Goghs.

His Vincent and Theo is a
colorful, insightful,
comprehensive van Gogh film
for our generation. Altman uses
the two brothers’ lives to explore
art, commerce, religion, sexuality
— everything in which the

director is interested.

The film begins with a television
excerpt from a late—1980s art
auction where van Gogh’s
“Sunﬂowers” is being sold for
some phenomenal sum. The
scene abruptly switches to a dark,
grubby 19th-century hovel. Theo,
a handsome, well-dressed man,
is visiting the home of his
hunchbacked, yellow—toothed,
temperamental brother Vincent.

Vincent and Theo switches
back and forth between the
brothers’ lives. Vincent (Tim Roth)
works at his art in southern France,
living on monthly allowances
from his brother. He paints a
pregnant prositute, then invites
her and her child to live with him.

In Paris, Theo (Paul Rhys)
rningles in bourgeois circles and

insight to Van Gogh’s legend

dates beautiful women. Theo is
forced to sell art he doesn’t like.

Art that excites him has no market

value. His inability to sell Vincent's
art is a double frustration: He fails
as a brother and as someone who
believes in bold, new art.

Theo recovers from a bout with
syphilis, gets married and has a
son. But Vincent’s deteriorating
mental condition takes a toll on
him. His fierce love forces him to
be his brother’s keeper. And the
two brothers’ fate is ultimately as
doomed as it is beautiful.

As a portrait of an artist, Vincent
and T beo portrays the van Goghs
with no undue sympathy or
sentimentality. Roth and Rhys play
the roles with combustible
emotions —— every scene between
them is a shouting match.

Roth’s Vincent is a deliberate
savage. His scowl and crude
physical mannerisms depict a man
alienated from the bourgeois
society he‘ was born into. Art is
his last hope —— the only thing
that gives him any meaning in the

world.

Theo must walk in two worlds

— the bourgeois Paris art world

and the devoted, maddening

world of his brother. Rhys plays

him as a noble guy trying to do

' the right thing in unfortunate

circumstances.
Vincentand Tbeois a rigorous,

highly original movie. You will
want to see it even if you’ve seen

the two splendid ﬁlms already

made about Vincent van Gogh

By Michelle Kleinsak

For (be Pitt News

This weekend, doctoral
candidates in the theatre-arts
program at Pitt will bring 3x1,
three short comedies by George
Bernard Shaw, to the stage of the
Studio Theatre in the basement
of the Cathedral of Learning.

The three one-acts by the British
playwright are “The Inca of
Perusalem,” “The Shewing-up of
Blanco Posnet” and “Dark Lady
of the Sonnets.” The plays were
chosen to give inexperienced
undergraduate actors a chance to
be seen on stage and doctoral
candidates an opportunity to
work on their directing skills in a
workshop atmosphere.

“We had a need for directing
experience, and they had a need
for acting experience, ” said Gregg
Dion, director of “The Shewing-
up of Blanco Posnet.” Dion
stressed that 3x1 is a production
in which the cast also coordinated
the set and worked on costumes.

In recent years, it has been

difficult for many undergrads to ‘

acquire acting experience
because of a shortage of roles.
The Ph.D. workshops were
created to change that by giving
young actors a taste of theater.

at 5:15 to walk over.

Because the projects are
concentrated into three weeks of
rehearsals and one week of
performances, the experience
isn’t as taxing as a full-ﬂedged
faculty production.

The directors chose Shaw
because of running time, cast
size and their own personal
preferences. Sherry Caldwell,
director of “The Inca of
Perusalem, ” said, “We read a large
number of Shaw’s one—acts to
give many directors a chance and
cast as many actors as possible.”

Dion added, “His short plays
are occasional pieces written to
address speciﬁc topics at the time,
but we thought they had some
degree of relevancy..”

Caldwell was quick to add that
although Shaw’s work may be
realistic, it is not simple. “Due to
the musicality of Shaw’s speeches,

we’re surprised by how much of
an obstacle it’s turned out to be
for the young actors,” she said.

Caldwell’s project, “The Inca of
Perusalem,” is the first in the
series of plays. It focuses on a
young woman whose marriage
to a millionaire has left her
penniless. The woman is hired
by a princess who is engaged to
another millionaire, the son of an
Incan prince.

Dion describes the second play,
“The Shewing—up of Blanco
Posnet,” as a travesty of justice
and courtroom dramas. The hero
is a rebellious figure that operates
on a higher level of consciousness
than everyone else in the play.The
play was banned as a
blasphemous work in England
for 10 years. It deals mainly with
Christian existentialism and
religious beliefs.

In the third play, “Dark Lady of
the Sonnets,” director Jon Cantor
creates a world where William
Shakespeare shares a late-night
tryst with Queen Elizabeth. The
play examines how Shakespeare
really came up with his work. Dion

said, “It’s really like the second
most-recognized playwright from
England is taking shots at the
first.”

3x] opens Friday night in the
Studio Theatre at 8 p.m. and runs
until Feb. 2.

Tberapeuticfolle songs from Georgiozs Indigo Girls

By Cheryl Neidlinger
Sta_[)"W1‘iter

The success of the modern folk
duo, Indigo Girls, according to
lead singer Emily Saliers, has so
far been in the songs. “For a lot of
people, at least those we’ve gotten
letters from and judging from the
songs they single out, our music
seems therapeutic. It’s about
going through the dark parts of
life in order to come to terms with

things in the end.”

No doubt Saliers and her
counterpart, Amy Ray, have
passed through their own dark
times, but what they have had to
come to terms with, especially
since their self—titled 1988 Epic
release, is widespread critical
acclaim and the rewards that
success brings.

Ray and Saliers met in the sixth
grade in Decatur, Ga., and formed
their first singing group in high

was adopted when they entered
Emory University in Atlanta. After
one independently released EP
and a subsequent full-length
album, the duo’s big break came
soon thereafter when they were
signed by Epic. The album Indigo
Girls was released in February
1989. The album was certified
gold by September, and Indigo
Girls went on to collect the
Grammy for that year’s “Best

Contemporary Folk Group.”
More recently, Ray and Saliers
have been busy touring and
promoting their follow-up
project called

have heralded the album, calling
it some of the most varied and

Rockers Living Colour have time on their side

By Cheryl Neidlinger
Staﬁ" Writer

Diversity uniﬁes. This statement
makes little sense, right? Not when
it comes to Living Colour.

In 1988 Living Colour tore down
the walls of music stereotyping
with its exotic looks, some nasty
guitar licks and hard rock ‘n’ roll
rhythms. It powered its streetwise
social consciousness into every

song and really challenged people
to not only sit up and notice it,
but consider what it had to say.

If its debut album, Vivid, and
songs like “Cult of Personality”
and “Glamour Boys” are what led
the way to the acceptance of its
diverse sight and sound, then its
new album, Times Up, certainly
cleans up the rest of the notion of
what a rock band can look like or
what a rock band can do.

Most people got their first
glimpse of Living Colour when it
was featured as the opening act
for the Rolling Stones on the 1989
Steel Wheels tour, even though
Vivid had been on the record-
store shelves for more than a
year. The band was making little
progress up until then, since its
music was not being heard on
rock radio.

“We broke the rules," suggests

bass player Muzz Skillings. “One
rule was that if you looked like
us, you’re not played on TV.
Another was that rock ‘n’ roll had
to be about sex, cars and partying
— and here we were, asking
people to actuallythinkl”

The tide finally turned when
MTV began airing the “Cult of
Personality” video. The rock ‘n’
roll crowd was exposed to Vernon
Reid’s electrifying guitar and

Corey Glover’s manic, energetic
vocals, and the rock ‘n’ roll crowd
lileed it. Vivid found its way to No.
6 on the pop charts and would go
on to sell nearly 2 million copies
worldwide. “At concerts we had
seen minds change right in front
of us,” says Skillings, “so we
knew it couldhappen. But it was
a tribute to the power of the
people that it actually did.”

Time’$ Up is Living Colour’s
second release on Epic, and it
promises to pick up where Vivid
left off. While the band could
have sweetened its sound and
made the material easier to
swallow, it refuses to let up.
“Those problems we talked about
on our last record haven’t gone
away,” Corey Glover notes. “We
continue those themes. We're just
as hard—hitting and finger-
pointing.”

The 15 tracks on T ime’s Up deal
with themes like environmental
concerns in the title cut “Time’s
Up,” materialism and possession-
oriented lifestyles in “Type,” the
universality of mankind in “Fight
the Fight” and the problems facing
young adults concerning safe sex
in “Under Cover of Darkness.”
About “Under Cover,” Glover
notes, “To me, ‘safe sex’ is a
misnomer. Sex is reckless and
wild and has nothing to do with
being careful. ‘Safe sex’ is about

rock and roll. At this point in its
career, the band is confident that
it can draw its crowd on these
things alone.

Living Colour established itself
in the rock world with two good
records, all the while remaining
true to who it is and what it is the
band does. Staying true to itself is
what helped them contend with
all the stereotypes and come out
on top. Said Glover, “We don’t
take off our masks on this album,
so you’ll find outwe’re really four

‘white guys from Connecticut on

certain beauty in that pain
and suffering. We find hope
in the humanness of things.”
