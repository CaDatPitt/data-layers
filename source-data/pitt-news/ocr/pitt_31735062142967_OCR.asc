full‘ authority by national and

In March, under the leadership
of James D. Finley, the military
group received permission to form
a nuclear unit of former active
members on campus to reorganize .
B Company, 7th Regiment.

June Thomson

»AJune Thomson, one time News
editor whose article on Gay Nine-
ties cuisine appeared in a recent
issue of the “Saturday Evening
Post,” always had faith in her
theory of starting at the top.

And well she might.

Her faith has recently paid with

a radio writing job and a ﬁance.

Miss Thomson and Sam Locke,
the man she’ll' marry in June,
have signed a contract with the
Co1'um'bia Broadcasting company
to write a 13-week sustaining pro-
gram patternedafter the “Life of
Reilly” format. '

The $300 per week stipend will
be split by Miss Thomson and
Locke until ﬁances become a fam-
ily affair.  I ‘T ‘

Locke has been writing night
club, radio, and movie scripts
since his collegiate days at Ohio
State university. Last summer he
collaborated with Ye-b Harburg
on the script for “Finian’s Rain-
bow” which is now making a
successful Broadway run.

The marriage of Locke’s sister
Catherine to Norman Corwin,
well—known author, will bring
Miss Thomson into a family that
lives the literary life. a

Miss Thomson graduated from
Pitt in 1945 and received her
master’s degree in journalism at
Columbia in June, 1946.

Social School
Changes Name,

Also Degree

The School of Applied Social
Sciences is no longer the School
of Applied Social Sciences!

Dean Wilbur I. Newstetter has
announced that the School of So-
cial Work will _be the new name
for what was previously called
the School of Applied Social Sci-
ences. '

Requirements Same

Another innovation accompany-
ing this announcement is the
change in the name of the mas-
ter degree granted ‘by the school.
The master of Social Administra-
tion degree will be replaced by
the degree of master of Social
Work. The requirements and cur-
riculum, however, remain the
same.

For‘, many years it has been

formly trained and qualiﬁec‘ social
workers was needed. This step
car1;ies out the trend that has
been increasing in professional
education. , ,. .,  _ .-

,‘‘According to a study made
recently of 40 colleges and univer-
sities, 45 per cent of them are
using the name School of Social
Workwith the accompanying de-
gree of master of Social Work,”
Dean Newstetter declared. “A few
years ago, possibly only four or
ﬁve schools were using the Social
Work degree and name,” he add-
ed. ,

The present school was started
in September, 1938, under the
name of School of Applied Social
Sciences. From 1931 to 1938 it was»
a divisionof Social Work in the

“Joan of Lorraine” Rehearsals
Reveal Impressive/lcting, Staging

by Dick Kovar

The ﬁrst non-'-Broadway produc-
tion of Maxwell Anderson’s ‘.:Joan
of Lorraine” opens at 8:30 p. m.
Thursday, May 8, in Stephen Fos-
ter memorial hall. Scooping every
drama group in the country; Pitt
Players ambitiously hope to give
an effective college interpretation
of the wide-praised New York
show.

i Out of the’ little back room on
the eighth ﬂoor the Players have
produced an absorbing drama
backed by impressive staging and
effects secured through painstak-
ing behind—the-scenes work. Re-
hearsals last week revealed some
exceptional handling of the dif-
ﬁcult starring roles by Martha
Morrison and Jack Abramson, and
excellent supporting work by the
entire cast.

'I‘hursday’s audience may be
a triﬂe startled when Abramson
walks off the stage into the aisle
and carries on dialogue with the
actors still on stage while he sits
among the spectators. Ed Nestor’s

should be equally comment—pro-
‘Voking. .

If rehearsals are any indica-
tion of the merits of the actual
performance, drama fans should
be well-pleased by Martha Mor-
rison’s deft handling of the part
originally written for Ingrid
Bergman. A sophomore, Miss Mor-
rison displays superior dramatic
abilities that seem perfectly suit-
ed to her role in “Joan.”

Director McHale takes no credit
for the girl’s masterful portrayal
of Joan of Arc. “Martha needed
no advice from me,” he conﬁded.
“She has handled the part mar-
velously since the ﬁrst rehearsal.”

“Joan of Lorraine” is being fea-
tured as part of Spring Festival
Thursday and Friday, but will
draw the bulk of its Saturday
audience from non-University
ﬁelds. Letters inviting high school
students and faculty to the ﬁnal
performances where mailed last
week; it is hoped that the fact
that the production is the ﬁrst

97/... Jun. 32...,

Tech has its Carnival, New Orleans has its Mardi Gras——but
Pitt—Pit.t has its Spring Festival——a time that should mean
something special to 511 Pitt men and women. _

-In the past few weeks, many‘ peoplelhave been saying,
“Wliat is this Festival thing? It’s all I’ve heard about for
months.” .

Perhaps, this is an oddftime to be telling you, who are new

V at Pitt," what Spring Festival is and what it means to those who

have attended it for two, three, or four years. But in all the
talking about and in publicizing of.Spring Festival, we‘ feel
that there has been a. little something overlooked. That. little
‘something is just this: Some “o1d-timer” has failed to tell you
greenies on campus what Spring Festival should oughta mean
to you—that Festival Week is a 16-year old tradition thathad
its beginning in.a still older tradition once known as Pitt Week.

That same old timer should have told you that the differ-
ence between Festival week and any other social aﬁair on cam-
pus is that in,-this week-long succession of events there is some-
thing designed “especially for you” and that if you don’t ﬁnd
that something special, Western Psychiatric is looking for you,
meat head. ”

Most people like to dance, says our friend, so the festival
committee of today as well as those of yesterday, plan two
dances, one’ on the super-delux scale with a name bands to dance
to hnd one afternoon stag affair to suit all types of dance lovers.
For those who like music there is the Band concert; the ath-
letically inclined can attend or participate in the sweepstakes

',.and‘ track meet; for the. ‘play-goers Pitt Players presents some-

thing spectacular. -

Tap Day is a crowning-—chiseling event in a class by itself.
It means a lot to a few, as only approximately 100 outstanding
students are honored at this exercise. It is, however, one of the
most signiﬁcant parts ‘of Festival Week. The crowning and

’ chiseling comes in when the Senior Queen, Alma Mater, and ,

ODK. awardee are made public-—Senior Queen will be "crowned

on June 10 and ‘the Senior Awardee’s name will be chiseled on

ODK. walk immediately.‘ .
Modern design breaks forth in an exhibit from the Phys Ed

idepartment; modern Shylocks give and take at a Carnival

Night, this year at Shadyside. .

Does nothing interest you yet? says the old-timer. Well, eve
the’ most passive, the ‘most immobile, he testiﬁes, can ﬁnd a dry
spot on the curb somewhere between the Cathedral and Schenley
Oval and watch pretty girls ﬂoatlby.

The old-timer would conclude his story by telling youthat
this year ’s and every year’s festival is what you ’ve been wait-
ing for+it is and has always been as good or as bad as Pitt
students-——but he ’ll also say “There ’s never been a bad festival
at Pitt, so go to it, says he, “the Festival isyours!”

Likewise, we say, the Festival is yours. Get out and see how

i the other half lives. Lc‘t’s have athletes at the play anddancers

at the sweepstakes. Our Motto is: ALL EVENTS OR NONE.

Panther Nine Closes
Season With Bearcats

Ralph Mitterling takes his Panthers to Latrobe today,
where they will face St. Vincent’s Bearcats in the ﬁnal game
of the season. Mi'tter1ing’s pitching selection will probably be
Deryl Calder.

If the Panthers beat the Bearcats, they will have compiled
an admirable record of six wins against three defeats. Mitter-
1ing’s men, however, will have to¢
be much steadier than they were
against Penn State last week.

The pitchers consistently walk-
ed Stateibatters, while the rest of

ends of the two-game series with
Pitt, had previously been twice
bea-ten by the same West Virginia
club that had last to the panthers.
The rampaging Jungle Cats were
perhaps due for a setback, so,
when they oppose St. Vincent to-

threw to the Wmng base5~ J°9 day, they will not be crying over

Bedenck’s Lions, who swept both spilled ball games.

Grid Squads
Deadlock 12-12

Fans jammed the Pitt practice
ﬁeld last week to watch the ﬁrst
and second teams battle to a 12-
12 deadlock, in the ﬁrst major
football scrimmage of the season.
Carrying the brunt of attack in the.
ﬁrst Panther backﬁeld, the old
combination of Carl DePasqua,
Bill Abraham, Bill Bruno, and
Lindy La_uro returned to action
together the ﬁrst‘ time this spring.

The second squad lined up with
Gus Radnor, Pete Fuderich, Tony
DeMatteo, and Lou Rickards, in
the backﬁeld.

Punting, a sore spot of ‘ast year’s
eleven, continued to be an ob-
stacle to mentor Mike Milligan.
During last week’s scrimmage,
Lou Rickards booted some de-
cent punts, and may improve by
next fall. Bill Hardesty may have
the makings of fair punter.

Numerous candidates turned in
stellar performances on the line
for both elevens. Wilbur For-
sythe and Don Karanovich play-
ed hard at tackle. Johnny Kosh
and Bernie Barkouskie showed
well at the guard slots. Walt Cum-
mings looked good at center.

Ortiz Wins YMCA
Bowling with 468  

Danny Ortiz of the Pitt Y
emerged as singles champion in
the Metropolitan YMCA duck-
pin tourney held at the "Allegheny
Y the past week. Danny had a
three-game total of -268, which in-
cluded a high 214 game.

Pitt did well in the team event
but not good enough to cop the
title. They did not fare very well
in the doubles.

Ortiz is a hot and cold bowler.
Starting poorly in the singles
event, he was far behind after two
games but ﬁnished his last game
with six straight strikes and"a
214 score. With a 456 on ‘the
board as high, his only hope was
to throw ﬁve strikes in a row

and he came- through admirably,

Baseballers Lose
Second To State

Once again, on ‘Saturday, the
Pitt Panthers outhit Penn State
but dropped the second straight
game to the Lions 7-2. Although
Joe Bedenck’s crew" showed no

outstanding power at the plate,
they were able to sweep the two-
game series by means of walks,
bunts, stolen bases, and Pitt er-

.1‘OI‘S.

Coach Mitterling gambled on
his batting p r a c t i c e pitcher,
George Schmidt, who yielded but
eight hits to the Lions. Consider-
ing his inexperience, Schmidt
pitched well; but his generosity
with walks proved hisdownfall.
Bob Gehrett, who hurled a 2-0
shutout against Pitt last year, was
the winning pitcher, granting 10
hits.

State scored ﬁrst in the initial
when Hackman walked,
advanced to second on a bunt,
went to third on an inﬁeld putout,
and then stole home. The Pan-
thers tied the count in their half
of the ﬁrst,~when Jackie Snyder
singled to left, scoring Art Barnes
from second.

State took the lead in the sixth
inning. Kurowski walked, went to
second on a bunt, took third on
a wild pitch, and tagged up on
Ken Yount’s long ﬂy to Wascieko.
The Bedenckmen cinched the vic-
tory by explodinglfor five runs in
the seventh and three hits and an
assortment of walks, errors, and
ﬁelders’ choices.

Pitt added another marked in
the ninth. Smodic singled, went to
third on .a double by Maitch, and
scored when McCullough ground-
ed out, short to ﬁrst. '
