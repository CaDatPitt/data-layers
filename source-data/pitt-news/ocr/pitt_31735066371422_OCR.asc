Debate over student representation flourishes

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

For two consecutive years, the
issue of lagging student participa-
tion in the Univeristy Senate has
generated debate that divides stu-
dent and faculty delegates.

Chairman of the senate budget
policies committee Wilfried Daeh-
nick said that, on the average, only
one out ot three student appointees
to his committee attend the meetings
regularly.

“I think it is a real problem,"
Daehnick said, adding that “as a
rule, the student participation per-
centage overall is frequently low."

According to Daehnick, many of

the topics discussed in the commit-
tees may not be of interest to
students.

“It may be dull for them at times,"
he said.

However, Daehnick said that he
wished students had a greater appre-
ciation for the issues that affect
them. He blamed this lack of under-
standing‘on the failure of the Stu-
dent Government Board to educate
its delegates.

Daehnick said he expects both
faculty and student committee
members to notify him when they
can not attend meetings or must
resign altogether. He said he does
not know why students are “typi-
cally absent” because they fail to
give him any notice.

“I think it would be correct form,
and certainly useful, for a student

resigning to notify the chairperson
of his committtee,” Daehmick said.

When asked about the standing
rule that three or more absences by a
delegate result in suspension ofcom-
mittee membership, Daehnick
admitted that the rule is not applied
to students. “If it were, we would
have no students,” he said. ’

Daehnick said that he might bring
the problem to the attention of the
top officers of the senate in some
official fashion, but he could not say
what action might be taken as a
result.

Richard Pratt, ch-airman of the
educational policies committee, said
that he also recognized a problem
with low student participation.

“Certainly, there has been a
decline in student involvement,” he
said.

Socialists angry
over cancellation

By David McGraw
The Pitt News

Reasons behind the cancellation
of a March 21 meeting of the Young
Socialists are still unclear, with the
group attributing it to “Zionist pres-
sure" and theunjversity administra-
tion responding that advertisements

for the meeting “misrepresented” the

sponsoring groups’ identity.

Student Activities Director Andy
Smith said the real reason for the
cancellation, announced the day of
the scheduled event, was the way in
which the meeting was billed in
posted flyers. The Young Socialists
were not yet an official student
organization at _Pitt but were
allowed by the university to hold an
organizational meeting in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union in order to gather
the signatures required to become
one, he said.

The problem, according to Smith,
was that the meeting was not adver-
tised as an organizational meeting of
the Young Socialists but rather, as a
“public meeting showing an anti-
Zionist film, “The Palestinian,”
sponsored by The Workers League,
a national political party.

The Young Socialists is the name
of the national youth movement of
the Workers League. Because the
League is not a student group and
because the advertising described it
as a public meeting rather than an
organizational meeting of a student
group, Smith said that the meeting
was postponed until the matter
could be “straightened out.”

The meeting was moved to the
First Unitarian Church on Ells-

“In the past, we had very useful
student input on general issues as
well as student issues,” Pratt said,
adding that all areas of involvement
have dropped off recently. “Typi-
cally, we see [students] once or
maybe twice,” he said.

Pratt pointed to student presence
without input as another example of
failing student participation. He
said he attributes this to students
perceiving their input as lacking
importance.

Pratt shared Daehnick’s view of
the difficulty students might have
maintaining interest on many topics
that come before senate committees.

“On some issues, the senate works
very slowly,” he said. “lt’s hard to
keep students engaged" he
explained, when they don‘t perceive

worth Avenue, although Young
Socialists spokesman Nancy Russell
blamed the “last-minute change” for
a lower attendance than was
expected. The organizational meet-
ing has been rescheduled for April
ll, and the Young Socialists are
once again planning on showing
“The Palestinian.”

Despite allegations by Russell
that
because of pressure by Zionists at
Pitt, Smith said, “We have never

cancelled a program because the.

Jewish community didn’t like it.”

The matter was brought to
Smith’s attention on March 20, the
day before the event, by Rabbi
Joseph Levine, who said that,
although he is a Zionist, he never
suggested the film be cancelled.

Levine confirmed that he did call
Smith to discuss the showing of the
film but added that he merely
wanted to discuss the program, not
to dictate what kind of program-
ming takes place at the university.
Levine said he informed Smith
about the way the meeting was being
advertised and asked for more infor-
mation about the group that was
sponsoring the film.

Smith said that the nature of the
film had nothing to do with the can-
cellation of the meeting and pointed
out that the film has been shown on
the Pit: campus in the past.

Smith also said that his office has
cancelled proposed meetings in the
past when they were not properly
advertised, citing a meeting of a
Moslem student group that was can-
celled because of the wording of its
publicity.

One of the major complaints of

continued on page twelve ’

the senate as anything more than an.
advisory body.

“They don’t have the time to deal
with a structure that only in indirect
ways effects change," he said.

As a means to alleviate the prob-
lem, Pratt suggested that Student
Government Board members should
sit in on some committee meetings
with their appointees. This he said
was done in the past and tended to
give an increased importance to the
proceedings.

The rule of suspending members
who miss three meetings applies to
faculty as well as students, accordirag
to Pratt. He called the rule itself a
“myth.” Pratt said that Senate
Council could not take the harsh
action necessary to suspend a dele-
gate, faculty or student.

Body found in Union men’s room

By Michael Weinman
The Pitt News

The body of a man was found
dead yesterday at approximately
2:20 p._rn. in the men’s lavatory on
the lower floor of the William Pitt
Union.

The identity of the 35-year-old
man. thought to to be of Middle-
Eastern descent. is being withheld
pending notification of next of kin.

Pitt senior Tim Hursen. an engi-
neering student who had been play-
ing chess with the Pitt Chess Club in
the Schenley Cafe, discovered the
body.

“I noticed his hand sticking out
from under the stall," Hursen said.
Hursen said he then touched the
hand and. after receiving no
response, returned to notify a friend
who was also playing chess. They
contacted security at the union.

“We went back inside,” said
Hursen. “and that’s when I first
checked for a pulse...There was no
blood, nothing."

Campus police were summoned
to the scene by William Pitt Union
building managers. The police then
notified Pittsburgh police and
paramedics.

Campus police have checked their
records and can find no record ofthe
deceased man as a Pitt student,

Civil Obedience Day

By Molly Brown
The Pitt News

Groups of concerned Pittsburgh
residents banded together Saturday
evening in a simulation of what they
would do in the event of a nuclear
attack.

Some fled to remote sites, some
sought urban shelters and one
group, wanting to be “the first to
go,” met in the center of downtown
Pittsburgh where they said a nuclear
bomb would most likely strike.

The Pittsburgh chapters of the
World Future Society and the
World Federalist Association par-
ticipated in the nation's first Civil
Obedience Day Saturday. The pur-
pose of the demonstration was to
show that protection from a nuclear
blast and fallout may be neither pos-
sible nor desirable.

A public workshop on “Coping
with a Nuclear Age” was held Friday
evening at PPG Place downtown.
John Rose, president of the Pitts-
burgh chapter of the World Future
Society, directed the group through
an exercise of expressing their indi-
vidual feelings about the nuclear
threat and the future of society.

Each member related a personal
story about his awareness of and
ability to cope with the nuclear

threat. Realizing for the first time
that he could have been the B-52
bomber pilot to destroy Hiroshima
was Rose’s turning point on the
nuclear issue and prompted him to
become active in the World Future
Society, he said.

One woman present was the
daughter of a chemist who partici-
pated in the Manhattan Project. She
said her early exposure to the threat
of nuclear power has caused her to
consider alternative energy sources
and to think seriously about the con-

survival

sequences of a nuclear blast and
fallout.

On Saturday, Civil Obedience
Day, some groups of families and
friends in the Pittsburgh area, like
others around the country, obeyed
the government directions for what
to do in the event of a nuclear alert.
Pittsburgh is one of 400 high-risk
areas.

Stephanie Hughes, an active
member of the World Future
Society, said, “The contrast of
knowing that it wasjust a simulation
was overwhelming — we knew we
had a future.”

The local participants split up into
three groups. One group evacuated
to a remote area outside the city.

There, ﬁve families spent the night in I '

a small church. Another group
stayed in a city shelter with appro-
priate provisions but without the
convenience of utilities.

The third group, calling itself the
Epicenter, consisted of people who
hold the belief that, when the bomb
hits, they want to be the first to go.
They feel that surviving a nuclear
attack would be a fate far worse than
death. These poeple banded
together at the Hilton Hotel in the
center of downtown Pittsburgh.

The conclusion of the simulation’s
participants was that there is really
no way to be protected from the
threat of nuclear war. The key is
prevention, they explained.

Broken Spring

. At this time of the year, most college students take off to Fort
Lauderdale for a one-and-a-half-week affair. They meet in the
sun-warmed air of Florida’s most popular beaches. Love’s
laborers lose no time in involving themselves in a week-long

romance.
They build for themselves an accelerated courtship that will

provide them with the necessary incentive to return to their
books. They return with a telling smile on their faces and a
memory in their hearts. It is a truly rejuvenative 10 days known
as spring break.

Pitt students, on the other hand, manage only to sweat out a
frenzied one—night stand. In one berserk explosion of roller
skating and sing-a—longs called Spring Fling, Pitt students try
desperately to release a semester’s worth of tension and
anxiety.

Pitt students have been studying nearly continuously since
January. By early April, most are at the end of their wits and
need to escape from the demands of school. Instead, they are
expected to be at thepeak of their abilities for finals, which
begin nine days from today.

Most students have the majority of their papers due during
the week before or after this ‘past weekend. It is a very trying
time for the harried college student. Spring Fling is a valiant
effort by the RSA to get Pitt’s students to relax, but the event is
not long enough to be of any realbenefit to most Pitt students.
Other than the semester breaks, Pitt has no real vacations of
which to speak. V

The Student Government Board and representatives to the
University Senate should draft and propose legislation calling
for the extension of Pitt’s term in exchange for a short spring
break. The extension could be as short as five or six days; it
would still get Pitt students out before those of most other
schools.

Pitt’s students deserve the opportunity to take a break and
return rested and fully prepared for their final exams. If Pitt is
trying to place itself among the academic elite, the administra-
tion ought to join these highly competitive schools and give its
students a break.

Fool Hardy

Anyone with a "slight sense of the macabre was excused
yesterday for any prank or practical joke that he pulled on the
unsuspecting. April 1 marked the day of fools.

We thought it might be interesting to view the latest develop-
ments of our world in that same spirit.

For instance, would it not be a great gag to suggest that the
current race for the Democratic nomination for the presidency
of the United States had developed into three well-informed
candidates articulating the fears and concerns of this nation’s
people?

Fears that the race for delegates in New York State had
turned this into an election for office in Israel, not the U.S.,
could then be soothed. The two frontrunners might set aside
the debate over where the U.S.’s Israeli embassy ought to be
located and remember that over 50 percent of the teenage
blacks in New York City are unemployed. The real problems of
our times —— inadequate public education, rampant crime and
social injustice, all of which can be found in New York City -
might get noticed.

Or what if the idea got around that a nominee for the
highest-ranking law enforcement position in the country actu-
ally upheld certain legal and moral standards? Edwin Meese
could be commended for his years of unselfish public service
and undaunted belief in justice for all.

The fun could be endless. Rumors could be spread suggest-
ing that the Reagan administration was actually a friend of the
working class. His administration's attempts at single-
handedly eliminating all that for which organized labor had
sacrificed could be forgotten: water under the bridge, spilled
milk licked clean by the cat.

Oh, what fun the day would be. A day of foolery for all the

world to see.

Imagine going to a lecture.
Shortly after the featured speaker
commences his address, some guy
creeps up and begins crawling
around on the floor in front of the
podium. For several minutes, this
guy walks from one side of the
speaker to the other; all the while,
the audience is supposed to pretend
not to notice this distraction. In
addition to this unusual diversion,
every few seconds, this guy clicks a
picture and rewinds his camera.

This is what happened Tuesday
night at former C.I.A. agent John

Grade School

teachers just
as competent

In his column in the March 19 Pitt
News, Joe Zeff ended an otherwise
fine piece on faculty salary with an
unwise, offhand remark. He stated,
“the faculty is composed of hard
workers who do a helluva lot more
than a grade school teacher who
babysits second graders." While I
am sure Mr. Zeff would not truly
characterize grade school teachers
as mere babysitters, I don't think he
realizes how damaging such remarks
are.

_As a TA, I approach my classes
with the assumption that the stu-
dents are motivated to learn. While I
attempt to make the subject matter
(Physics) as interesting as possible,
all of my students are 18 years and
older, and as adults, the responsibil-
ity rests with them. But who is it that
must work to instill this desire to
learn and the discipline to study? A
large part of this responsibility rests
with the primary and secondary
school teachers of this nation.

I plan to cam my doctorate, and I
desire a university position, but I do
not fool myself into thinking that

I

what I hope to do is more important ‘

__Letters To The Editor

than the job of a grade school
teacher. Theirs is a difficult, ongoing
and vital job. ‘Without the students
these teachers produce, the work of
a university is useless.

The Gospel

according to
Grad student

The article, “God's favorite son,”
by Chriss Bosso (The Pitt News,
March 16) produces a description of
20th century Christianity that is not
only unscriptural, but blasphemous.
He could not understand the life and
iiiinistrv of Christ and still say that

Faith is, or should be, a private
_matter.” This is ludicrous.

Would they have crucified Christ
if he had kept his faith private? No.
They crucified him because he was a
challenge to the established religious
views of the day. His teaching was
not in private. So how has it come to
be that Christianity is now por-
trayed as a private matter?

The article leads me to believe that
if the writer has any faith, then it is
so innocuous that he must keep it
hidden out of shame. Faith ‘is not
intended to be on exhibit, but
neither is it to be hidden.

It is obvious to me that Mr. Bosso
should not venture into an area in

which he has no expertise. His quote .

from Matthew 6:5-6 about praying
in public wastaken out of context.
Christ made these comments to dis-
courage people from making a spec-
tacle out of their prayers — praying
to get attention. It would be analo-
gous to praying out loud on a busy
street corner. This verse does not
mean that one should never pray in
public.

Another way in which Bosso goes
wrong is that when he quotes the
Christian viewpoint, he makes refer-
ence to Jerry Falwell. Since when
was Falwell nominated as God’s

spokesman? Falwell is only the
spokesman for the far right, Chris-
tian segment. I hope that he did not

intend  statement about-Chris-
tians as those who wear their reli-

gion on their shirt sleeves" to apply
to every committed Christian.-

If one takes a real look at authen-
tic Christianity, he will see that it
cannot be compartmentalized and
separated from day-to-day life. If
one‘s zeal is mixed with temperance

' and tolerance,‘then it will ‘not result ‘

in rejection of those who do not
share one‘s viewpoint.

If Mr. Bosso desires to make
social comments about Christians, Q
he should be more knowledgeable of (U
the authentic Christian faith and not
the insipid 20th century counterfeit
version.

Jesus placed it all in focus when he
said, “Let your light shine before
men, that they may see your good
deeds and praise your Father in
heaven.” .

U.S. schools
work for

capitalism

In an article in your paper on
Monday, 26 March, a prominent
member of Pitt's School of Educa-
tion was quoted as saying that
American schools do not practice
“sorting.” I was very surprised to .
hear this. Surely it is a misquote.

The role of a school in our system
is selecting, preserving and passing
on conceptions of competence, ideo-
logical norms and values. Schools
process both knowledge and people.
Poverty and low achievement are
integral products of the organiza-
tion of our economic, cultural and
social life.

Schools act as an active force to
give legitimacy to economic and .
social forms and ideology. Thus,
non-possession of high-status know-
ledge is an importantpart of the
balancing of the system. Those who
have it don't want too many other
people to have it also. Value is
retained through selection. A corpo-
rate economy needs high levels of
technical knowledge, but only to the
extent where there are enough peo-
ple to maximize production. Beyond
that it is counterproductive.

Schools are institutions that func-‘.'
tion as channeling colonies. A
school is a central place to teach hi-
erarchy, competition, and submis-
siveness to young people while
serving adults as an employment
and opportunity market. Schools
practice institutional ranking. In
such a situation the normal end of
social relations is sorting and
stratification.

Simply because the United States
has compulsory education does not
effect a change in the sorting procef
of schools. To assume so reflects a
great deal of distance from the real-
ity of education in America.

Unequal treatment should sound an alarm

If you will permit me to add to the
proliferation of letters on the subject
of homo-/heterosexuality, I would
like to bring up a point that I haven’t
noticed anyone raising in the letters
that have been previously published.

When you find yourself advocat-
ing that another person be treated in
a fashion you would not like to be
applied to yourself, alarm bells
should go off in your conscience. It’s
a clear sign ‘that the potential for
unfairness exists in the situation in
question. Sometimes there are valid
reasons for treating a person differ-
ently — a murderer is jailed, a sui-
cidal person may be confined or
ordered to undergo medical or ‘psy-
chological treatment.

Sometimes the reasons can’t be’
well justified, as in the case of racism

or sexism. In these circumstances,
the person involved has not been
regarded first and foremost as an
individual human being; he or she
has been dealt with according to a
set of assumptions that are applied
wholesale to a particular group.

It is your responsibility to exam-
ine your own assumptions and
motives when you deny to someone
else a right or privilege that you
yourself can exercise freely or when

you advocate special treatment for a _

particular person or group. I assert
that ignorance, fear, self-
righteousness and blind emotional
reaction (whether or not clothed in
rationalization) are notesufficient
foundations for understanding
someone else’s circumstances. Put-
ting yourself in the other person’s

shoes is a much better technique.’

As a woman, I have in the past
been discriminated against in the
areas of pay and promotion; I have

endured sexual harrassment on the
job and come up against ingrained
attitudes about the differences
between women’s and men’s capa-
bilities that simply didn’t apply. As a
low-income person, I faced diffi-
culty in obtaining medical_care and

discovered that many people take it
for granted that to be poor is to be
inferior. It is not fun to have these
things happen to you! It eats away at
self-esteem, denies personal freedom
and has dehumanizing effects. These
attitudes hurt us all, because they

help prevent people from fulfilling
their potential as human beings.

We are all people, gay or straight.
We owe it to each other —_,and to
ourselves —— to remember that and
treat each other fairly. It is not fair to
deny a person housing or employ-
ment or child custody or the free
exercise of the rights to free speech

or privacy (to name a few exam-
ples) on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion. It may be legal, but that doesn’t
make it right.

I have heard and read many
explanations of why it is right and
good to discriminate against gay
people and even a few reasons for
discriminating against straight peo.
ple, and none of them holds water.
There s no reason to go into individ-
ual arguments here; I have stated

above what I consider to be the

strongest reasons in favor of equal
treatment.

Misinformation about sexuality is.
met with on all sides in our society.
This is particularly true of homosex-
uality. I would urge anyone who is
interested in carrying on an intelli-
gent discussion of the subject to edu-
cate himself about it and face
squarely his or her own personal
feelings about it and about sexuality
in general and its functions in the
relationships between people.

Election

I had just finished my early break-
fast of Pop Tarts and a can of
Stroh’s when a sudden knock came
upon my door. I was greeted by two
machinegun-wielding members of
the Pitt Ranger Club who had come
to remind me about today’s presi-
dential elections.

They encouraged me to hurry

along ,to the polling place -to avoid F

the expected heavy turnout. I was
reminded of the heavy military pres-
ence when I passed Blimpie’s on
Semple St. in the shadow of two
Armored Personnel Carriers.

Martial law had just been lifted in
the country and presidential elec-
tions were under way. The field of
candidates was limited to three -
Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms and
Jerry Falwell —— and just yesterday,
they had finished campaigning in
Pittsburgh. ‘Reagan had declared
martial law six months earlier dur-
ing a general strike led by the AFL-
CIO. ' e

In the aftermath, the AFL-CIO
was ‘outlawed, and its membership
was thrown into prison. When the
prisons were full, football and base-
ball stadiums were used to house the
overflow. The 1985 National Foot-
ball League schedule had to be can-
celled. When Walter Mondale

rushed to aid the AFL-CIO, he was
arrested and placed in prison. The
Democratic
outlawed. ,

The University of Pittsburgh
came under occupation. The Radi-

Party was also

Day in Oakland, El Salvador

cal Student Association led a stu-
dent boycott of classes to protest the
20 percent raise in tuition, culminat-
ing with an occupation of the Board
of Trustees meeting.

Tensions were raised when the
faculty’s union went out on strike to

protest the administration’s union-.

busting campaign. The Radical Stu-
dent Association and the faculty
then formed an alliance and occu-
pied the Forbes Quadrangle and
Hillman Library. They immediately
demanded that the university’s
administration agree to their

‘demands of a cut in tuition and
increased faculty and student con-”

trol of the university.

Faced with a hostile student body
and faculty, the administration con-
vinced the governor to declare mar-
tial law at Pitt. Chancellor Posvar

was appointed the head of the Uni-.

versity of Pittsburgh Junta, and he
deputized the members of the Pitt
Ranger Club to patrol the campus.

Two members of the Radical Stu-

. dent Association were abducted by
' the Oakland Death Squad, and their
brutalized bodies were later found in »

Schenley Park. Their bodies were
unidentifiable. The students
responded to this provocation by
erecting barricades on Forbes
Avenue and burning the ROTC
"headquarters on-the 17th floor of the
Cathedral.

The university junta called in the
National Guard from East Liberty
to assist the Ranger Club in putting

down the insurrection. Thousands
of students and facultv were arrested
and placed in Pitt stadium.

Life became unbearable at Pitt.
The College Young Democrats
began a petition campaign to win the
release of those imprisoned in Pitt
stadium. They were met with tear
gas and later disbanded as a student
organization, as was the Radical
Student Association. A general
purge of the faculty began, and those
remaining were forced to take loy-
alty oaths. The university was filled
with spies. No person could move
about without fearing that he was
under surveillance.

When the administration ran into
obstacles ramming its legislation
through. the Student Government
Board, it too was disbanded.
Members of the Students For Life
were put in charge. Their first order
of business was to close the Planned
Parenthood center in Oakland.
They later a held a weenie-roast in
front of the Hillman library and
burned all of its “subversive" con-
tents. “The Joy of Sex” was the first
to be heaved onto the pile. ‘

.. The last club to be disbanded was
the Frisbee Club. Frisbee flying
became listed as a “subversive”
sport, and members of the club were
arrested for stepping on the grass of
the Cathedral lawn. To this day,
they remain in Pitt stadium.

The last pocket of resistance in
Pittsburgh was in Homestead.

' There,.the Steelworkers had armed

themselves and taken over the mills.
Homestead was the last area under
martial law, and it had been declared
a “free-fire zone.” Units of East Lib-
erty National Guard were conduct-
ing a “pacification" drive, and
successful “strategic hamlets” were
being implemented in McKeesport.

Life was hell in Pittsburgh.
Shanty-towns were springing up on
the outskirts of Mt. Lebanon and
Fox Chapel, and the inhabitants of
these communities were alarmed at
the increase of “undesirable ele-’
merits.” The problem of overcrowd-
ing was solved when the gates of
Three Rivers Stadium were opened.

Violence became a way of life in
Pittsburgh. One could find bodies
strewn all over.“The Eazor Trucking
Companies, refrigerated division,
was saved from bankruptcy with an
increase in demand for cold-storage
space.

The Allegheny County Morgue
was filled to capacity, and refriger-
ated trucks were needed to hold the
overflow.” Cyril Wecht had to resign
his post of county commis-sioner and
resume his occupation as coroner.
There was a boom in the funeral
business.

I resumed my studies at Pitt.
Eighty percent of the history depart-
ment faculty had been canned or
imprisoned. The course curriculum
for the semester consisted of three
classes: the History of the Republi-
can Party, History of U.S. Business
Enterprise and the History of Evan-

gelical Bible Thumping.

Later, I learned that the history
department had come under the
direction of members of the Unifica-
tion Church. Daily readings of the
works of Reverend Moon became
the norm. A noticeable difference in
the ‘power and attractiveness of fra-
ternities at Pitt became evident when
the Interfraternity Council changed
its name to the Intercult Council;

The student body moved from rel-
ative apathy to complete zombifica-
tion. George Orwell would have
been proud of the efficiency and suc-
cess of the administration’s junta.

I made my way down Forbes
Avenue to the polling station in
Tower B. I wondered what might
happen to me if I "did not vote.
Would I end up like the others?
Would they confine me to Pitt sta-
dium on a diet of meatloaf? Fear
overtook my conscience. I won-
dered, -for whom.,should I vote?
Whichof the candidates would
make things better, I-asked myself.‘
Falwell promised a Christian Holy
War in alliance with Rev. Moon.
Helms promised a carton of North
Carolina tobacco to everyone who
voted for him. And, alas, Reagan
promised to stay the course and
claimed that America again was
“standing tall.”

My conscience of fear opted for
Jesse Helms. After all, I could use a
carton of cigarettes to calm my
nerves. -

SGB resurrects judicial board

By Diane Leﬂcowitz
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
(SGB) has begun accepting appli-
cations from students for the Stu-
dent Government Judicial Board,
which is being reformed after more
than two years, as called for in the

S student government constitution.

The functions of the judicial
board, whose members will be
selected within the next two weeks,

according to SGB president Ken ‘

Stram, will be to monitor student
government as a whole, to select the

chairman and members of the Elec-'

tions Committee and to “stand by if
something goes wrong in the elec-
tions process.”

The SGB’s judicial board is dis-
tinct from the university’s judicial
board which hears disciplinary com-
plaints against students and individ-
ual grievances by students.

There has not been a student
government judicial board for as
long as any current SGB members
can remember, and the board itself,
along with its Elections Committee,
has been taking on the functions of

_ the judicial board during the past

two November elections, Stram
said.

“Of course it’s important. It will

be there to oversee that everything is
done right,” Board member Avery
Abrams, who is in charge of writing
amendments to the SGB bylaws
concerning the judicial board, said.

“It’s there to make sure the
board's doing its work.”

Stram explained that the judicial
board has traditionally had little real
work to do. One of its functions, he
said, has been to call for the
impeachments of student govern-
ment officers if and when valid
grounds exist. A

A meeting of the Elections Com-
mittee last Monday produced a reso-
lution asking the SGB to allow the
Elections Committee to preside as
an actingjudicial board until such a
board is appointed. Elections Com-
mittee members had said the SGB
was scheduled to appoint a judicial
board last January.

SGB member Dave Pikovsky
responded last week by saying that
the judicial board had not yet been
formed because a restructuring plan
for the judicial board was not yet
completed.

The student government constitu-
tion now calls for six students to
serve on the judicial board, but the
current SGB restructuring plan will
provide for the chairmen of the six
standing committees to be members
of the judicial board as well as six
students who are not involved with
student government. A

“It’s for the balancing effect,”
Stram said.

The proposed amendments out-
lining this restructuring plan will be
presented in a referendum during
next fall’s elections for the board
and board president, Abrams said.
The new Elections Committee and
committee chairman will be
appointed by the new SGB judicial
board under the old format.

This process will be done at the
end of this term or the beginning of
the fall term, Stram said.

Pitt’s latest Fulbright winner to
study French music, cinema

By Jim Shaughnessy
The Pitt News

Creative activity ﬂourished in
Paris in the early 1900s. Ballet,
cinema, music, sculpture and paint-
ing were beneficiaries of the many
talented people who worked in Paris
during that period.

According to Grover Wilkins Ill,
director of orchestral and choral
activities at Pitt, “Paris was the cen-
ter of musical exploration and visual
exploration — in terms of visual arts
and cinema. There was a cross-
fertilization in the I9l0s between
film makers and musicians," Wil-
kins said. “The major music com-

iposers worked with the film people.”

Wilkins is the recipient of a Ful-
bright Senior Research Grant to
study this cross-fertilization and its

-‘products. The prestigious scholar-
ships are awarded to American
graduate students, teachers and pro-
fessors to study, teach, lecture and
conduct research abroad and to for-
eign nationals to engage in similar

activities in the U.S. Under this
grant, Wilkins will study music writ-
ten for the cinema by major French
composers of the early l900s.

Wilkins hopes to answer the ques-
tion of how the film genre influenced
the music of these composers or how
their other music inﬂuenced the film
genre through his study in Europe.
Wilkins will examine the impact of
music on film in Paris, France; Gen-
eva, Switzerland and Brussels,
Belgium.

The purpose of Wilkins’ project is
“to do research on music written for
French cinema by major French
composers between 1908-1950. Spe-
cifically, to find out where the actual
musical parts are, find out what con-
dition they are in and to edit them
for possible performance.”

While the film from this period is
known, preserved, documented and
analyzed, the accompanying music
is virtually unknown.

“The real reason for pursuing this
is that the major composers in
France wrote for the movies and
that’s not true of anywhere else,”
Wilkins said.

CSYt#iEC.:
QEPWE7 

Nothing’ Predicts Pregnancy

Wilkins discovered this subject
while on one of his searches for new
and obscure music in the shops of
French music publishers.

“I do a lot of looking for music
when I travel. We always done that
in Paris because I'm there every
year.”

Wilkins’ interest in this subject
was aroused after viewing the reissue
of the classic French movie
“Napoleon."

“ ‘Napoleon’ was the whole deal. I
saw the movie here and was inter-
ested in the fact that it was an old
movie with new music. It didn’t
sound right, so I went to digging and
found out that Arthur Honegger
had written the original music.”

Wilkins has received a University
of Pittsburgh Faculty Research
Grant for start-up work on the pro-
ject.'The grant will enable him to
travel to France during the summer
to establish initial contacts, find out
where the musical pieces are and
make it clear to important sources
that he will return sometime in the
next year to do the actual study.

Revealing
a foolish
history

Yesterday was April Fools
day, the one day out of each year
when you can get away with fool-
ing your friends to no end. Did
you get fooled?

If you did, blame it on the
French, because they started the
foolish tradition way back in
I564, after they accepted the
revised Gregorian calendar. Up
until that time, France’s new year
celebration had begun on what is
now March 2| and ended on
April 1. However, when new
year’s day was changed to Janu-
ary l, traditionalists balked and
continued celebrating it on April
I. They soon became known as
“April fools.”

Gradually the new calendar
was accepted, but the idea of the
“April fool” was so amusing that
the custom of fooling friends and
relatives on the first day of April
actually grew in popularity. It
even spread from France to the
rest of Europe and to other
countries around the world,
including the United States.

In modern France, the target
of an April fools joke is called an
“April fish.” One popular prank

your victim's coat. If it‘s done
right, the “April fish” won't dis-
cover the joke until either the
snickers or the aroma give it
away.

April 'Fool‘s Day is observed
throughout the English-speaking
world on April I, but in Portu-
gal, Mexico and India, it is
expanded to two days, the Sun-
day and Monday before Lent.

Some of the classic April fools
stunts include: sugar in salt shak-
ers, greased doorknobs, dresser
drawers switched, short sheets,
and whatever the imaginative
mind can dream up.

Student runs for state office

By Susan Koval
The Pitt News

Pitt senior Chuck Pascal. 20, is
running for the Democratic
State Committee. the policy-
making body of the Democratic
Party on a statewide level. Pascal
is as young as any candidate for
the office in Pensylvania history,
but, he said, “I have an image of
being older.”

Pascal, a political science
major, is one of seven endorsed
candidates among 13 on the
party ticket for a seat in the
state‘s 43rd Senatorial District.
Pennslyvania‘s voters will go to
the polls on April 10.

Even though Pascal is only 20,
he has been politically active in
the past. He has been an Alle-
gheny County committee man
for two years and is also an active
member of the Governmental
Relations Committee of the Stu-
dent Government Board here at
Pitt. Pascal has also attended
state committee meetings in Har-
risburg during the last two
summers. “I feel very compe-
tent," Pascal said.

Pascal said that campaigning
has left him very busy. “It’s like a
full-timejob. I go to ward meet-
ings, fund—raising parties, and

Chuck Pascal’s name will be on the ballot next Tues-
day. The Pitt senior is running for Democratic State
Committee in the 43rd Senatorial District.

just try to talk to as many people
as I can. Last week, I had six
meetings to go to injust one day.

Pascal was injured in a car
accident two weeks ago. He said
it delayed some of his campaign-
ing, but things are better now.
“Things are going well now. We
got the endorsement, and many
friends have helped me out. The

only handicap I have now is that
my name is next to the last on the
ballot.”

If elected, Pascal plans to help
strengthen the Democratic Party
by electing a new chairman, elim-
inating the party‘s debt and
appointing new delegates to the
national convention in San
Francisco.

Generations Together

Old and W9 Few   

By David Mcﬁraw
The Pitt News

Young and old alike gathered yes-
terday afternoon at the Jewish Com-
munity Center in Oakland to
recognize the student volunteers
who participated in Generations
Together, a branch of Pitt’s Center
for Social and Urban Research dedi-
cated to serving Pittsburgh’s elderly.

The program included a commen-
dation by Congressman Bill Coyne
and a tap—dancing performance by
Saxie Williams. About 100 people
attended the event, which provided
community functions, a picnic and a
sing-along. —

“This is an opportunity for all of
the people involved in the program
to come together, celebrate and be
recognized for their participation,”
said Heather Newman, program
director of both Youth In Service to
Elders and Young Volunteers in
Action, programs incorporated into
Generations Together. ~

Newman said Generations
Together is a unique organization in
this area because it is the only pro-
gram that provides orientation and
training for the youth volunteers
and also provides those it helps with
follow-up support.

The Generations Together pro-
gram has had over 500 student par-

October, 1982. These students have
provided service to over 500 of the
elderly in the area.

Volunteers include college and
high school students. One volunteer,
Allderdice High School senior Ann
Dolan, visits Martin and Marion
Baunstein every week. Mrs. Baun-

stein said that Dolan helps by read-
ing the newspaper aloud for them,
talking with her husband and taking
them to community events such as
concerts and flower shows.

“Its a terrific program,” she said.

Student participation in Senate questioned

continued from page one

It is the responsiblility oi the stu-
dent organization to keep its
appointees informed on procedures
and educated on issues, according to
Pratt. “However, that may be too
much to ask ofa sudent body at this
time,” he said. .

Student Government Board presi-
dent Ken Stram said he is distressed
by reports of student absenteeism,
although he admitted that “this
semester, student participation has
slacked of 

Stram said that he recognized the
problem last year as board member
in charge of student appointees. A
system was developed at that time
which called for written reports after
committee meetings and meetings of
the student appointees with the

members of the board. According to ‘

Stram, the system worked well for a
while, but because participation was
not clearly made manditory at the
onset, it was difficult to enforce
later.

This year, particiaption by SGB
appointees will be made mandatory
and the system of reporting and
meeting with board members will
continue.

“We want them [students] to stay
in touch with us so we know what‘s
going on,” Bob Kramer, SGB
member currently in charge of stu-
dent delegates.

According to Kramer, nearly 70
students applied for the 45 positions

 

that SGB appoints to the senate. He
said that the applicant turnout indi-
cated a renewed interest on the part
of students.

“Last year, we didn‘t even have
enough applications to fill all the
positions,” Kramer said.

The current high response offers
SGB a safety net in the event that
some student appointees fail to ful-
fill their responsibilities of attend-
ance. Kramer said that he will review
board delegate attendance fre-
quently and that, if students are reg-
ularly absent, their positions will be
offered to other students who
applied.

Other changes in the board’s
approach-are designed to encourage
student participation, according to

Stram. A new term of office extend-'

ing from September of one year to
September ofthe next has been insti-
tuted for student appointees. In the
past, the term ran from January to
January. .

With a term of office that follows
the academic year, Stram hopes
there will be more consistent partici-
pation and greater continuity
throughout the school year.

In addition, meetings of student
delegates and board members will
begin soon, Stram said. These meet-
ings are designed to acquaint new
deletates with the procedures of the
senate and explain their responsibil-
ities as participants.

“I’m sure that some ofour people
do miss [senate meetings] occasion-
ally,” said Nancy Belli, recently
elected president of the College of
General Studies Student Associa-
tion. But in defense oftheeoccasional
absentees, she added that most CGS
students work full-time and are not
always available to attend meetings
held during the day.

“Our people usually show up,”
said Sharon Boag, past president
and current CGS student govern-
ment board member. According to
Boag, when CGS delegates are
unable to regularly participate, they
are required to officially resign their
positions.

Two CGS appointees resigned
this year: one as a result of illness
and the other because of graduation
in December, Boag said.

“I refuse'to take the rap for stu-
dents who don’t attend and are not
our students,” Boag said. “I think
you’ll find that our students attend
and participate.”

Boag was supported in this by
Oxanna Kaufman, who described
CGS delegates as “extremely
conscientious.”

Kaufman is secretary of both
budget and educational policies
committes. She said that the student
participation problem could be a
carry-over from previous years.
“There have been years when [stu-
dents] have been very good and

years when they have not. This is a
‘riot’ year,” she said.

According to Kaufman, the thor-
ough preparation required to partic-
ipate in committee work may
involve more effort for students than
they are willing or able to apply.

Other obstacles to student partici-
pation include the shorter term of
office for students (one year) than
for faculty (three years), and stu-
dent inability to attend meetings
during the summer, Kaufman said.
These obstacles tend to create prob-
lems of adjustment and continuity
for students, according to Kaufman.

She suggeted that committee
chairperson hold open meetings
prior to the appointment of student
delegates, thus giving potential dele-
gates the opportunity to experience
the process first-hand before they
commit themselves to the position.
"Students need to have a clearer
sense of what input they can make,"
she said.

One notable exception to the lack _

of student involvement is SGB
member Bob Ewald. Ewald sits on
the budget policies committee.
While acknowledging problems
of too little student participation in
senate, Ewald said that there have
also been problems arising from
conscientious student involvement.
Ewald cited the recent handling of
a student proposal to expand the
internship office as an example.

The Student Government Board of the University
of Pittsburgh invites all interested students to I
apply for a postion on the

Student Government

TOTO

    
   
   
   
     
      
    

After passing the budget policies
committee, the proposal was
stopped in senate council when that
body voted favorably on a counter-
proposal submitted by Senior Vice
Chancellor Jack Freeman, accord-
ing to Ewald.

Ewald said that Freeman’s pro-
posal recommended maintaining the
internship office at its part-time sta-
tus until expansion could be “stu-
died thoroughly."

“It was definitely defeat [of the
student proposal]." Ewald said.

According to Ewald, there is a
possibility of reallocating student
activities’ moneys out of student-
oriented areas as a result of the Pro-
vost’s reorganization plan.
Although students may be more
interested in computer usage, athlet-
ics and student affairs, they should
closely minitor what happens in the
area of budget,‘Ewald said, adding,
“I think student government should
take an active part here.”

While the majority of faculty
members in the senate are suppor-
tive of student pariticipation, occa-
sionally a student comment has been
brushed aside or treated lightly,
according to Ewald. This leads to a
decreased likelihood of further stu-
dent input, he said.

Ewald suggested that faculty
members could be more sensitive to
student delegates as they familiarize
themselves with the formats and
procedures in the senate.

Socialist
meeting
dropped

continued from page one

the Young Socialists is that the
meeting was not cancelled until “the
last minute,” according to Russell.
She asserted that the reason for the
late notification was so that the
Young Socialists would not have
time to notify the public of the
change in the location of the
meeting.

Smith contended that the matter

~was not brought to his attention

until the day before the scheduled
meeting and that he notified the
Young Socialists the next morning.
He said he would have contacted the
organization sooner if he had known
of the problem beforehand.

However, Workers League
member Leslie Bataille suggested
that Levine may have deliberately
waited to call Smith in an attempt to
ruin theeffectiveness of the group’s
organizing efforts.

Asked yesterday ifthis charge was
true, Levine said, “Absolutely not. I

M swear to you...the minute I heard of

the program, I called Andy. There

was no delay whatsoever on my”

part.” He said he was unaware of the
meeting until the day he called
Smith, when a student pointed it out
by bringing a flyer to him.

Smith concluded by saying that
his office does not limit free speech
but that it does control the use of
university-funded buildings. He said
that the university has the right to
control the time and place of student
group meetings and that such meet-
ings must be advertised correctly.

State all-stars pin (1.8. in classic

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

The Pennsylvania wrestling All-
Stars defeated the United States All-
Star team for the second year in a
row 31-15 in the 10th annual Pins-
burgh Press Wrestling Classic at the
Fitzgerald Field House on Saturday
night. In the preliminary match, the
WPIAL squad tied the state of Ohio
24-24.

Although the classic attracts the
top wrestlers in the c.oi1n‘try, it also

-attracts just as many coaches, all of

whom get a chance to check out their
prospective recruits.

“Anybody who’s anybody will be
there,” said Pitt head wrestling
coach Rande Stottlemyer. “lt’s a

chance for the coaches who recruit
nationally to come in and make
comparisons."

Stottlemyer. like all the other
coaches, has his eye on several ofthe
participants, with four Pennsylvania
and three WPIAL representatives
leading the pack on his recruiting
list.

Jim Martin (98 lbs.) of Danville
High School and Joe Cesari (l38
lbs.) of North. Schullkyll High
School are two top-notch recruits at
whom Pitt is looking.

Martin is a three-time PIAA state
champion who finished with a career
record of 159-2. In the classic, he
pined Jim Sorcher of Cheyenne
(Wyo.) High School in 5:38.

Cesari is also a three-time PIAA
champion who ended his high
school wrestling career with a 154-5-

1 record. He lost in the classic to
Potomac‘s Lenny Bernstein 2-0.

Joe Yancoski (150 lbs.) and
Mark Sidorick (167 lbs.) are two
more Panther hopefuls that partici-
pated Saturday night.

Yancoski, out of Mt. Pleasant
High School, was a state runner-up
at this year’s tournament and fin-
ished with a 138-14 record. He
dropped a close 6-5 match to Urban-
dale (Iowa) High School’s Mike
Guthrie (122-6).

Sidorick, from Phillipsburgh-
Osceola High School, is a state
champ with a 73-9-l high school
mark. He defeated Carmichael’s
(Calif.) David Lee (137-l) by a
score of 9-4.

Three WPIAL representatives on
whom Pitt has its eye are l 19-pound
Chris Perri from Mt. Lebanon High

School. l55-pound Mike Tongel of
North Hills, and Ken Hackman
(185 lbs.) of Derry High School.
Perri dropped a decision to Hoo-
ver’s (Ohio) Dan Willaman 20-2|.
while Tongel lost to Ohio’s Pete Mit-
chell 5-4 and Hackman lost to
Benford-Chanell‘s John Moore 8-5.
Although it is a recruiting para-
dise, Stottlemyer points out that the
classic is not just for the coaches.
“It’s notjust forthe recruiting,"he
said. “It is good for evaluating the
kids that are wrestling,” he said, “but
they are here to show their wrestling
skills to the fans, not the recruiters.”
Stottlemyer also points out that
the classic being held at Pitt does not
necessarily mean that he is going to
get the pick of the litter, although he
had nine former classic participants
on this year’s squad, including sen-

iors Jeff Jelic and Joe Throckmor-
ton. junior Doug Hains.
sophomores Kyle Nellis. Joe Bond
and Gary Bolin, and freshmen Hal
Bolin. Mike Cappozoli and John
Throckmorton.

Two other Panther wrestlers,
freshman Greg Zimmerman and
sophomore Jack Uppling, were also
invited to participate but had to turn
it down for various reasons.

“Most of these guys were western
Pennsylvania wrestlers, and we were
in contact with them throughout the
year," said Stottlemyer. ‘’It‘s not like
we got them because the Classic was

‘held here, but it didn’t hurt us

either.”

The Press Classic, which benefits
the Old Newsboy’s Children’s Hos-
pital fund, was move to the Fitzge-
rald Field House three years ago
after seven years at the Civic Arena.

‘‘It’s great for our program." said
Stottlemyer. “it shows that Pitt is
interested in wrestling. It is the pre-

miere wrestling event in the country .

for high school wrestlers. I am very
happy that the administation lets
these kids come in here to wrestle."

Pitt News

Special to The Pitt News

The Pitt News basketball team
suffered a heartwrenching loss Sat-
urday to arch-rival WPGH radio 40-
34.

Led by former varsity Panther
basketballer-turned radio analyst
Herb Lake, the WPGH crew carried
a 20-l8 lead into the second half
before the Newsers jumped to their
only lead of the second session to
21-20 on a Jim Pietras 20—footjump
shot.

The radio team suddenly took
control and forged its way to a 27-21
lead on a Lake dunk.

The Newsers decided to go to their
inside game where they had had
some success in the opening half.
The result was peachy, five Bob
Green buckets and the Newsers were
within two at 28-26.

“When we were able to get the ball
inside for that spurt, I thought we
really had them on the run,” guard
Karl Kobil said. “Theyjust had too
many horses. We got tired and lazy,
and they took advantage of that."

Pitt‘s radio station put together
another run, and before the Newsers
knew it, they trailed by a 36-29
count. It was then that The Pitt
News decided to call a time out to
discuss their final stretch drive
tactics.

“We knew we were ina position in
which we had to try something
totally different from what we had
been doing throughout the game."
Green said. “So we went to a 1-3-1
half-court zone defense with Pietras
out front, O’Hara and Erkel on the
wings, Kerr in the middle and me
down low. And it worked well, but
wejust couldn”t get the shots to drop
down the stretch." The Pitt News
cut the lead to 37-34 on a Charlie
O’Hara l8-foot corner jumper
before the radio stations crew
scored the final three points and the
buzzer sounded.

“I think we improved quite a bit
over last week‘s performance."
editor-in-chief and point guard
Todd Erkel said. ‘‘I‘m proud of our
effort. and I think we could beat
them with a little more practice."

The Pitt News basketball team is
ready to play any challengers. All a
group has to do is reserve a court
and a time on a Friday afternoon or
a Saturday morning and the
matches can be set. Any interested
parties should call 024-5920. -27. -28

Heisman Trophy winner Mike
Rozier finally had a day which was
worthy of his title. not to mention
his salary. Rozier totalled 90 yards
on 24 carries.

“l was happy with 50 yards,just so
the effort’s there,” Rozier said. “I
know l’ve given a good solid effort
so I'm happy.”

“I think we showed a lot of people
today that we have a lot of other
threats on offense. Teams have been
keying on me a lot. and now, they
have to look at Jackie, too.”

The apparent achievement of bal-
ance on the offense couldn’t have
come at a more opportune time for
the Maulers, who this weekend will
face the undefeated New Orleans
Breakers and their star running back
Marcus Dupree at the Louisiana
Superdome.

“lt’ll be a great challenge for us to
contain a running back like Mar-
cus,” defensive tackle and former
Pitt basketball player Sam Clancy
said.

W _  M Z _ , ‘‘We‘re going to be playing a good
0e’5h/ The Pi" News football team. and it will takea lot of

Puccini's Hairmetrics

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

Even though the Panther ten-
nis team was I-2 in weekend
matches, head coach George
Dieffenbach is not disappointed
with the squad.

“I am very happy with eve-
ryone," he said. “We have been
gaining experience with every
match."

Pitt defeated Washington and
Jefferson, 9-0 Friday before los-
ing two straight to Slippery
Rock, 7-2 and George Washing-
ton, 8-l.

Yesterday's match against the
Colonials showed the type of
team the Panthers have this year.
Two of the six singles matches
and two ofthree doubles went to
three sets against a George
Washington team who has
played several highly ranked
Atlantic Coast Conference teams
along with West Virginia.

‘I am very happy
with everyone. We
have been gaining
experience with
every match.’

——George Diffenbach

 

“We gave them some tough
matches," Dieffenbach said. “We
used our heads out on the court
and lobbed and volleyed well.”

Dieffenbach gave plenty of
credit to number threesingles
player Jack Kaila, who overcame
a knee injury in the second set to
defeat Todd Long of George
Washington, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2.

“It was a big win for Jack,"
Dieffenbach said. “He showed
the heart and character needed to
win.”

Netters win one, then drop two

Dieffenbach said he was not
sure of the severity of Kalla‘s
injury, but mentioned that the
decision of his playing today
against Akron at Trees Court
will depend on the Pitt trainers
and his own evalution of the
injury.

“We are hoping it isjust a mus-
cle pull.” Dieffenbach said.

Even if Kaila plays, Dieffenb-
ach will move him to the number
six singles position and the rest

‘ of the starting lineup will move
up one spot.

If the freshman is unable to
perform, Kevin Lash will take
the number six singles spot and
the number three doubles posi-
tion with Chuck DeVera.

Today’s match is critical in
determining the 4-6 Panthers’
success this season. Pitt has only
lost to the Akron Zips once in 13
years.

“Today is a very pivotal match
for us,” Dieffenbach said.’
“Akron should have a represen-
tative team.”

Oakland linebacker Dean Moore is swamped by

:porI:s

first home game ever, 28-14, yesterday at Three Rivers Stadium.

Maulers deﬂect Invaders, 28-14

By Charlie 0’Hara
The Pitt News

A Glenn Carano 77-yard pass to
wide Jrackie Flowers with 1:09
remaining in the third quarter was
the clinching touchdown as the
Pittsburgh Maulers defeated winless
Oakland 28-14 at Three Rivers Sta-
dium yesterday.

The post pattern Flowers ran was
not designed for him to receive a
pass.

“Actually, I was running a post to
clear out for Greg [Anderson, the
other wide receiver on the play] to

cut across the middle,” Flowers said.
“But the corner didn’t go with me.”
Six plays later, Carano again
found Flowers, this time on a cross-
ing pattern for the score from seven
yards out. That made it Maulers 28,
Oakland 14 with 13:30 left.
“We took advantage ofthree turn-
overs, and we scored 21 points,”
Mauler coach Joe Pendry said. “In
the second half, Oakland gained
some momentum, but we came back
with the big play in the pass to Flow-
ers. In the end, we made the plays
that counted."
The Maulers crossed the goal line
three times in the first half as they
took a 21-0 lead. Carano hit Flowers

for a pair of first-half touchdowns
and scored a third time when he
dove over on a quarterback sneak
from one yard out.

Oakland was able to dent the
scoreboard once in the opening half
when quarterback Fred Besana hit

Marc Lewis on a 31-yard scoring
play.

The Invaders made a game of it in
the second half when they took the
kickoff and marched 65 yards on 10
plays as Besana hit wide receiver
Gordon Banks for 17 yards, closing
the gap to 21-14.

“It was a much different situation
for us out there today," Carano said.
“That was the first time this year that
we were able to get a big lead. We
had to preserve a lead rather than
play catch-up like we‘ve had to do
this year.”

Carano played the entire game
with confidence, something that
hadn’t been there in the opening five
games, and Flowers had a great deal
to do with that. The two connected
five times for 140 yards and three
touchdowns.

Carano was 10-of-15 passes for
186 yards, the three touchdowns and
only one interception.

Forget the Zips?

The Panther tennis team lost two of three matches
over the weekend, but Coach George Dieffenbach
is not discouraged. The netters take on Akron
today, and have had little difficulty breaking the
Zips’ code over the years. The Panthers have won
12 of the last 13 matches. '
