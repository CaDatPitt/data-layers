: On ‘last ,Mon’day,'.l\l'ove‘rn'ber 25,
1912, the University restaurant man-
agement -installed a lunch system in

I I the Dental_Colleg_e, at the top of the

campus. A popular 15 cent box lunch
is served, as well as coffee, hot choc-
olate, or milk, which will be 5 cents
extra. For -the convenience of the

» Medical students coﬁee will be sold

by the bucket at the Dental College,
from where the boys can carry it to
their own building, together with
their lunch boxes. It is the intehtion
of ‘the restaurant management to get
a line on the number of lunch boxes
required, so as‘ not to get any more
boxes packed than needed. Mr. Wolfe

» ’of the restaurant suggests that each

building have a man who will geta
line on the number of lunches wanted,
said man to call up the ‘restaurant not

later than 10 A. M., stating the n_um- V

ber of boxes desired for their respec-
tive buildings. Get together now,
boys, and. with a little co-operation,
we.can take your lunches direct to
you, without '~1m'v-iu.—- you .come down

RIVAL CLUBS TO
COMPETE FOR HONORS

 

(Continued from Page 1)

Blue glee and mandolin men of indi-
vidual importance. T-O winthat de-
sired individuality, even in the wake
of defeat on the gridiron, -is the sole
purpose of each man on the Pitt club.

During the past eight weeks since
the Musical Club’s organization was
effected, Director H. P; Ashe, of the
Glee Club, and former Pitt student,
has held weekly rehearsals with the
seventy members, and states that they
are now ready for a most entertain-
ing concert. Mr. Ashe, ‘Who is a mem-
ber of the Pittsburgh male chorus,
has hadiwide experience in glee club
work, and his efforts in bringing out
the Pitt club will satisfy the audi-
ence Thursday night, to Say the least.

AS an additional feature in the sing-
ing: Mr. A, R. Cancelliere, Of the
Medical .s_‘chool,«,whO has so thorough-
ly” entertained large concert audiences,
as soloist for the Gold and Blue Uni-
versity for the past two years, will
again appear as soloist Thanksgiving
night. His ltalianiand Spanish selec-
tions have received increasing ap-
plau_se with each year, and his part‘
of the program work this year will
entertain-
merit.

J. Wein-man Cratty, who has the

»Mandolin Club under his direction, is

about ready to break ;camp_and swell
forth with his mandolinists, etc, in
great array. The string instrument
club will make the “hit Of the times”
says “Judge” Cratty, and his state-
ments will ‘be backed up by a well
rounded musical mandolin club.

The State College men will come
here sixty strong to take back to Mt.
Nittny the musical‘ honors, if possible,
but the Pitt clubs must be taken into.
consideration ﬁr.st.

Old Pitt in her palmiest days had
no better musical organization than
has she this season, and the concert
staged will be of merit characteristic
of other Pitt Student musical bands.
With such a large organization of stu-
den_ts their many friends and fellow

students will turn out in full-force

Thaiﬂ<sgiving night. E’en our own
fair co-eds have given promise that
they will be among the motley crowd
in this musical. '

Final. rehearsal of both Mandolin
and Glee Clubs will be held, Wednes-
day afternoon at 4 o’clock in Carnegie
Music Hall. Every man will be ex-
pected at this meeting.

tion of the ideal. But he must strive

Tombo, assistant professor of Ger-

Columbia University, summed up his
address on Gerhart Hauptman-n"s

“Sunken Bell” at the weekly convoca- ,

tion last Friday morning in Memorial

Hall.
The play by the great German
dramatist,‘ Hauptmann, who cele-

brated his ﬁftieth birthday last week,
is ‘a fairy drama, a fantastic vision.

-The Story deals with Henry, a bell-

founder in a small village of Ger-
many, a character who is really a rep-
sentation ‘Of Hauptmann, whose pre-
vious play had not been .3. success. V

The play is full of big ideas and
beautiful ideals which Dr. Tombo
brought out in very eloquent lan-
guage. His analyses of the character
of Henry and his emotions; the dif-
ferent incidents in his striving to ob-
tain an ideal and their similarity to
incidents‘ in Hauptmann’s life were
very cleverly drawn by the lecturer.
His clear synopsis of the play and his
elegant language all went to make up

one of the most ﬁnished lectures we

have hadthis year.

_ OUR DUTY’: ~

If we lived in the times of our fore-
fathers, we would not go to Forbes
Field -this Thursday to witness the
game between State and; our own
men, but as we are members of the
present day and generation, -it isthe
duty of every man that. has the inter-
est of Pitt at heart toget out to that
game and to root for the Blue and

portant reason why .ev.ery man should
be at the game. The team needs your

b

help ‘at this game-—and, moreover, d.e=

serves the help of every student. ’ '
The past season -has not been the

most successful one that-we have ever

had-—-in many ‘respects’ it has been one '

of the poorest on the records of Pitt.
Despite the poor- showing oflthe. team,
theispirit that \has' been manifest by

the students haslbeen the best that

has even been produced at the‘Uni-
versity. In defeat "the! rooters, have-
stood by the‘te:_i‘m even better than in
the days when we were winning all
the games that were played. This is
the right spirit, and it ‘islthe spirit
that must be displayed at the game
tomorrow. Win or lose, stand by Old
Uni until the end" and make the stands
ring with the songs and cheers ofyyour
Alma Mater. ,

. When a team is notwinning games
there are always a few of the “Loyal”
students that ﬁnd all manner of fault
with the coach and the players and
all the people connected with the
team, and try to put a damper onithe

PITT-STATE CONCERT,

V The Third Annual Joint Concert of
the Pitt-State Musical Cl‘ubs will be
the main attraction of the students of

_the University on tomorrow evening.
The‘ men of both. institutions ‘have’
been hard :at work for a couple‘

months in.preparation for this event
and t-hey should be able to give a
good aocount.of themselves. The pro-
gramthat has been prepared is one
of,the most attractive that has been
offered at any performance of the
musical clubs of the University. 0
Every student that is able should
be at the concert, as it a part of
the activities .-of the University and
deservesithe. support of the student
body. Manager Hise has spared no
pans in the matter of getting up the
best ev4ening’s entertainment that is
possible, and a large crowdslhould be
on hand to see how well the men are
able. to perform. Almost as__ great
rivalry exists between the musical
clubs of the two institutions as -exists
‘between the football teams, and each
side will endeavor to make the biggest
hit with the audience. A big delega-
.tion of State men will be on hand and
it isgdesired that there be more ,of'»the
Pitt men there than those of State.
Give the musical clubs a boost, fel-

Society, which‘-

Thursday, November 21, and at which
faculty members of the dental school

prepared, and in ‘ addition to these

many c_hair and table clinics-were in.

prominence.

A paper by: George ‘Edwin Hunt, _ .
D. D. S., editor of theQ“Oral Hy— '

giene,” was of, great interest, andwas
thoroug.hl_v discussed by 0. II. Her-
ting, D. D. 'S., of the dental .depart-

ment, while Don S. ‘Leet, D. D. S., A

class of 1901, discus»sed,i—t with a well

and carefully prepared paper, which‘

aroused Dr. Hunt’s antagonism to a
great degree. ‘ “

The rnoﬁng picture play, which
was recently produced under the aus-
pices _of the National Mouth Hy-
giene Association, at Washington, ,D.
C., was ‘a leading factor of the meet-

most fastidious. This picture play
created a sensation among the many

GIVES TALK QN BIRDS

 

,“He knows ‘more about birds than
anyone I know of,” said Dean Fetter-

“man, in introducing Dr. Frederick S; ,

Webster, city’ ornithologist, who
spoke in college chapel Wednesday
morning on ~.“Our Bird Neighbors.”
And when Dr. Webster had ﬁnished
every one was quite ready to agree.
Dr; Webster brought along a num-
ber'of stuffedspecimens, with which
to illustrateihis talk. He fouched

upon the value of. birds to mankind,‘

making the astound.in_g statement
that, if all the birds were killed, the
earth would be uninhabitable in 20
years. He also ‘mentioned the sixth
sense which enables lblirds to ‘find
their way back to the same nest each
year, and illustrated the. various

"methods of nestvbuilding by actual

Squad Numbers Over 40, But Coach Flint Needs More.Big

' Men——lVIacQuown Has a Big Schedule :6 A
- _“ Practice Going; Well

While the basket ball squad is the
largest that has ever turned out -for a
Gol.d and Blue indoor team, Coach
Flint is very anxious to have more
big fellows on the team.. Last year's
team lacked but one qual-ity, and that
was the important one of weight.
Every team that- Pitt tackled, partic-
ularly the Eastern teams, hadiplayers
on them that outweighed and over-
topped the Pitt men to such an extent
that itwas often laughable. .A basket
ball team needs big’ men the same as
a football team does and it is on’ this
account that the coach is issuing a
call for more big fellows. By the
latter we mean a man who ‘is over ‘5
feet 10‘ inches in height‘anh'weighs
over 155. , . . .

Manager MacQuown has notggiven
out ‘his schedule for, publication, but

it 'is well known that he has the best
card ever arranged for a Gold and
Blue basket ball team." There is an
Eastern trip of six games in as many
days, and also a good ‘Western’ trip.
Dartmouth and Haverford are said to
be on‘ the former and ‘it ‘has been
rumored that Penn will send a team
to Pittsburgh which will open athletic
relations between the two institutions.

There is a splendid chance for new
men on the team as several of las.t
year’s stars have graduated, includ-

ing McDowell and Harley Campbell. 6

Of last season’s squadthere remains

~charm‘against the Gold and Blue team ‘

spons-,ible for the Red and Black vic-
tory. Capt. Stan Ewing of High
School played a‘star game b-oth on
the defense andoffense, his all-around
work being a large factor in the game.
He was.injured.‘at the close of the
second quarter, and while he remained
on the sidelines durin_g the third
period he absolutely refused ,to remain
longer. than this time, and ﬁnished the
game. Probably the best_playin'g‘ of
the day was showed by Meadows, the

High quarter. »He handled punts in

splendid, besides this he made several
sensational open ﬁeld tackles.’ Cori.-

an easy victory over Pitt, but many
predict that “Joe” Tl1ompson’s team
will givethe up-state crowd the hard-
est‘ game. of theirrcareer and it is more
than probable that this will be the
case. ' ‘i 7 V
Everyman in the State lineup and
most‘ of their subs are veterans, some

 

’ «having played on the team for four

years. Capt. Mauthe, Dexter, Very
and Herman played" in 1909 and have
been. on the eleven ever since.
“Shorty” Miller was. added to the list
in 1910’, and Berryman, Clarke, Han-
sen, Lamb, Bebout, Engle and Tobin
played in 1911 when Pitt lost the de-
cision 3-0 in .a game which should
vi-ctory by

a good score.

Capt. Mauthe is probably the most
valuable Inan on the team, as ‘he is a
splendid player and also one of the
best kickers in football circles to-day.
He won the game "for State against

A Pitt -las't “year by a placement, and

this season has booted the ball over
against Cornell, W. & I., Ohio State,
Villa Nova and Gettysburg. He is
also a~good‘)unte.r and a dependable

I

‘player on both offense and defense.

“Shorty” Miller will also hear watch-
.ing, as he is said to be one of the
best quarterbacks in the East. He
has been unable to gain an inch
against Pitt in the past two years, as
the ends and tackles smbared him
every time he got the ball, but State
claims that he will do very differently
this year. Tobin and Berryman will
probably hold down the halfback
positions and .are both fast, hard
players. They are veterans and_the
latter" also played at_Westi Virginia
University ‘for 7a season. Very and

. Wilson will play atgthe» ends, and are
i the best men at this place ever turned
_ out at State.

The former was named
on the second All-American team last
year, but the most ardent State ad-

. herent had to own that he was out-

played by “Hube” Wagner in the
Pitt-State game. Levi Lamb and
“Dad? Engle will be at tackles, with
Bebout and Hansen at guards and
Clarke at center. Bebout _captained
the championship P. H. S. eleven in
1910,'and Clarke played for East Lib-
erty Academy. 0

Pitt has but one man who played
in 1909, Capt. Galvin holding that

honor. ‘Wagner played for the team

in 1910, as did Bill Leahy, and Smith
made the varsity last year. These
men are the only veterans appearing

tory seemed slimmest. They will put

-against State, and if the latter expect
a. runaway, they will be ‘greatly dis-
appointed ere, the“ whistle sounds the
close of the contest. ‘

The team started slowly, winning
the ﬁrst two games in listless fashion.
The Bucknell game was lost 6-0 and
showed thatithe team was in misera-
ble form both physicauy and in gen-
eral football knowledge. The eleven
fought hard in the‘. Indian game, but
lost 45-8. In this game Capt. Galvin
was injured" and was on the sidelines“
for the next three §game_s, which
greatly weakened the team. The
Navy won the nextggame from Pitt,‘
13-6, and -iHockensmith,' the most
promising lineman of ‘the season,
was so badly injured that he was lost
to the team for the remainder of the
season. With Galvin in the game
Pitt would probably have‘ won with
“points to spare. Mc'Ellroy-was also
remain in bed for over a week.
Notre Dame was played to a stand-
still .at Forbes Field the following
week, but won thrdugh a ﬁeld’ goal,
3-0. No one was hurt ‘and all‘seem,ed
bright for the W. & J. game which
followed an S easy game‘ with Mary:
land University, but in the latter
game, Shoff received .a dislocated
shoulder which handicapped the Gold
and Blue eleven in the W. & I. game.
Such a long line ofwmisfortune has
never before followed a Pitt team, and
it »'is_to be hoped that it will end with
this football season. . _

The most pleasing feature of a dis-
appointing season is the remarkable
spirit shown by the entire
-graduate body. _ More loyal support
was never“ given a team—the famous
spirit of. Yale, which is a by-word
when loyalty is spoken of, is not one
whit better than the splendid sup-
port given Pitt’s teams whether in
‘victory or blackest defeat. Pitt men
have not given‘ up once this year and
in the last minute of the last quarter,
when defeat was inev-itable,,t‘hey have
shown themselves to be staunch and
loyal to the team by cheering even
louder than at the start of the game.
Not a knock has been heard between
the games when there seemed really-
to be some cause for criticism. The
team has had a miserable season, but
they are young ‘and inexperienced,
and when the spirit has been instilled
in them as it appears in the cheering
section, no team in the country will
be able to stop their advance. .

bst Enjoyaible Smoke   

in the  World

VERY man knows that pipe smoking is the

ideal formin which to use tobacco. Only

 by smoking a pipe, can —you get the full
beneﬁt and enjoyment from tobacco. ‘

And yct—‘-thousands of men reluctantly deny '

-themselves the pleasure of the pipe———because fancy

“mixtures” and ordinary tobaccos bite the tongue,’

dry the throat and upset the nerves.
It is not necessaryionger to forego the pleas-
ure a pipe can give you.

 

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and ‘Cigarette

Tuxedo cannotbite the tongue or irritate the
throat. The reason for thisis that Tuxedo is made
of only the mildest, choicest leaves of the highest
grade, perfectly aged, Burley tobacco, by the
famous “ Tuxedo process.” _

The “Tuxedo process” is _ a secret, known
only to its manufacturers. . '

It was discovered by Dr. R. A. Patterson, the
founder of the R. A. Patterson Tobacco C0,, after
many years of experiment. Its popularity has never
been artiﬁcially forced by sensational advertising.
vThe demand has grown naturally and steadily,
until now nearly eighty million’ packages are sold
yearly. '

You can smoke Tuxedo in the oflice, on, the
street, and at home. It cannot make you nervous;
its aroma is delightful, and it cannot smell up lace
curtains -or“ your clothes.

YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE

ness and combined richness, that it

’ seems the ultimate and only tobacco

for the connoisseur. I can recom-
 it unqualifiedly.”
