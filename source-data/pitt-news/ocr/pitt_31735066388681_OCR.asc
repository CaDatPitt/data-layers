”A district court has discretion

Marshall said.

He added that allowing such
discretion, and not forcing feder-

"best serves the principles of
economy, convenience, fairness
and comity.”

/ackson wants better
campus protection  

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Members of the Student
Government Board are trying to
improve campus security and
police protection for Pitt students,
SGB President Craigjackson said
at last night's SGB meeting.

Jackson, along with student
government representatives and
campus security representatives
from other Pittsburgh colleges
and universities, appeared this

' week on WTAE’s Pitt5burgh’s

Talking program to discuss cam-

’ pus crime and security.

”We’lI be meeting with Wil-
liam Tucker, [director] of the Pub-
lic Safety office, to discuss some
of the things we didn't get to dis-
cuss on the program,” Jackson
said.

Tucker said on the program

that there were 20 incidents of ,

violent crime on Pitt's campus
last year. -

”What the figures don't show
is the crime that happens to Pitt
students off campus,” Jackson
said. ”North Oakland, South
Oakland, if the campus bus goes
there, to me that's still campus."

Jackson said he feels the
university has a responsibility to

provide adequate protection for
students living off campus. I

’.’Basically, security sucks. The
police all gather by the ‘O’. 
What I'd like to see is police
more spread out over the neigh-
borhood,” Jackson said. ”As far
as campus security, they [the
office of Public Safety] need to
define campus a little better.
When you have residence halls
that are four and five blocks from
any [other campus building],
where is campus?”

Tucker, along with assistant
directors of Public Safety Walt
Waters and Gary Moses, could
not be reached for comment at
presstime.

In other business, Jackson and
board member Tanya Jackson are
scheduled tomeet with Barbara
Shore, former president of the
university senate’s Affirmative
Action Committee, to discuss the
addition of the words ’’sexual
orientation” to the university's af-
firmative action statement.

Jackson reiterated that if i.t can
be shown that discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation is
taking place within the universi-
ty, the SGB will draw up a reso-
lution urging the board of trustees

For a while, Bill Oehling
was in the running for dean of
the School of Dental Medi-
cine. When the dental stu-
dents heard that the present
dean, Dr. James Smudski,
"would be retiring in June, they
passed a petition to have him
considered for the spot.

Oehling is well-liked by the
staff and students and has
been active in the school for
two and a half years. He feels
very comfortable at the school
and could have had a crash
course in dentistry from the as-
sistant dean. There was,
however, one drawback —
Oehling is not qualified.

”Wi|d Bill” Oehling, as he
is called at work, is a custodi-
an at Pitt's dental school.

’’It all started out as a joke,”
said Oehling. ”The student
doctors initially suggested that
I run for dean. I told them to
get a petiton going, and we'd
see what happened. After a
few days, when nothing did

myself. I really had their

Oehling said that he
received 244 signatures from
faculty and students in support
of his applying for the position
and an additional 100 from
the members of Pi Kappa Al-
pha fraternity, where he is an
honorary "member.

’’I had total support of the
student body, with hardly any
effort on my part,” said Oeh-
ling. ”The students had peti-
tions all over the place. One
was in the locker room with a
note on it saying that I would
make ‘One hell of a good
dean.’ I even got the present
dean, Dr. Smudski, to sign one
petition.”

”Sure I signed it, said
Smudski. ”Bi|l always has a

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 21, I988

  
 

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Shiite
Moslem militiamen withdrew
Wednesday from all positions
ringing Palestinian refugee camps
in Beirut, ending a nearly 3-year-
old siege.

Syrian troops immediately
rolled into buffer zones around
the Chatilla and Bourj el-
Barajneh shantytowns to enforce
the newly established peace be-
tween guerrillas of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization
and militiamen of Lebanese
Justice Minister Nabih Berri’s
Amal.

Reporters saw Amal irregulars
pull away in trucks and jeeps
from sandbagged positions and
earthmounds surrouding the two
camps, home for an estimated

‘ - 30,000 refugees. *

The move came to enforce a
decision declared by Berri on

A Saturday to lift the military block-

ade in what he called a unilater-
al initiative to end the so-called
”camps war” that had killed
more than 1,600 people and
wounded 3,600 by Lebanese
police count.

Berri said his move was a gift
to the ”heroic people” who have
been protesting Israel's occupa-
tion of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

The Shiite withdrawal brought
the two Beirut refugee camps un-

der the direct control of the Syri- A

an army, which deployed a
7,500—strong contingent in the
Moslem sector of the Lebanese
capital last year to curb militia
fighting.

The force at the two camps was
estimated at 1,300 Syrian troops.
They took up positions in 17
battle-scarred buildings overlook-
ing the interior of the shanty-
towns and the Shiite slums
surrounding them.

Amal spokesmen, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said men
would be allowed to move free-
ly in and out of the two camps as
of Thursday.

Girl who got 5 organs

PITTSBURGH — Tabatha
Foster, the 3-year-old Kentucky

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

girl who received five organs in
a rare transplant operation, was
reported improving slowly Wed-
nesday.

The girl, from Madisonville,
Ky., was listed in serious but sta-
ble condition in a private room
at Children's Hospital of Pitts-
burgh, where she received a new
liver, pancreas, small intestine
and parts of a stomach and col-
on in an operation ending Nov.
1.

”She’s doing well,” said hospi-
tal spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
”The progress and the gains have
been slow, but there have been
gains.”

The girl, who was born with
short gut syndrome, which would
have been fatal without surgery,
has never eaten solid food.

Doctors are feeding her baby
food through her mouth, a spe-
cial formula through a tube
through her nose to her stomach,

and a special formula intra-
venously, Miss Cardillo said.

Doctors have said they have no
precedent for feeding such a pa-
tient. Two other patients have un-
dergone similar operations at
other hospitals but died within a
few days.

”She’s doing all the things a
normal 3-year-old would do, go-
ing to the playroom and playing
with other children,” Miss Cardil-
lo said.

Bishops warn of sex
abuses in our society

LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — Ro-
man Catholic bishops of Texas
say sexuality is a ”magnificent gift
from God,” but contemporary
abuses of it are enslaving people
and ”eroding the moral fiber of
our nation.”

They say a return to chastity, in
which intercourse is limited to
marriage, is ”perhaps one of the
greatest needs of our time.”

In a pastoral statement, the
state's 16 bishops said promiscui-
ty involves a biological function

  Where will we turn

when all turn away?

Thursday's unseasonably warm weather, reminiscent of
spring, bore with it a perennial springtime issue at Pitt: cam-
pus safety and the lack thereof.

With the righteous indignation which is almost annually
characteristic of the Student Government Board, the Jackson
administration has launched yet another campaign to make Oak-
land safe. While it is naive to think that the SGB has the power
to eradicate crime in our community, previous efforts by for-
mer administrations have resulted in the campus taxi service

' and a campus-wide Crime Watch Program. Both have contribut-

ed positively to the safety of Pitt's campus. .
However, for approximately 70 percent of Pitt students, secu-
rity on campus is of little concern after their last class of the

A’ day. While dorm residents have the rea_ssuring_presenc_e of desk
attendants and campus police patrolling their domain, those

who live off—campus take a much greater risk when venturing
to and from their homes.

Is the university responsible for the safety of students who
live off—campus? It-is undoubtedly the responsibility of Pitts-
burgh City Police to protect all the residents of the city, off-
campus and on. If the city police were able to execute this
responsibility adequately, university police would be redun-
dant, even on campus. But even with such ”doubIe protection,”
university officials cited 20 cases of violent crime on campus
last year. Even this high figure isgrossly misleading when one
takes‘ into account the dozens of muggings, rapes, robberies
and assaults which victimize students every semester off—campus
in Oakland.

Crimes occur all over Oakland, not just on campus. And not
just at the corner of Forbes Avenueand Bouquet Street, where
the Pittsburgh Police concentrated its officers after a wave of
trouble there last year. Since the majority of Oakland residents
are Pitt students, the university has a vested interest in keeping
it safe. -

No shelter from
the political storm

It looks as though Gary Hart got caught with something more
serious than his pants down. Yesterday, the Miami Herald print-
ed a story describing a less-than-savory financial relationship
between Gary Hart and an executive of a California-based video
production company.

The executive, Stuart Karl, allegedly contributed the $3,000

” per month salary of a Hart adviser, the use of his company's

Lear jet and various other campaign expenses. The Federal Elec-

I tion Commission allows only a $1,000 donation from an in-

dividual per campaign and stipulates that no candidate will
receive any money from a corporation.

So far, Hart has refused to comment on the situation, and
his side of the story is certainly needed before a reasonable
opinion can be formed.

However, we can only hope that the investigation of this new
development will proceed along lines a little less opportunist-
ic than the last Hart investigation. Should the allegation prove
to be correct, it is also our hope that Hart will step aside grace-
fully, sparing the public another spectacle of ”character exami-
nation.” The political waters are muddy enough.

A resolutionary

It's just about that time of year
when most people's New Year's
resolutions go by the wayside.
That's not to say these individu-

als didn't have the best intentions

when they either quit smoking,
stopped drinking, began losing
weight or began spending more
time at home or in the library.
Maybe that's the problem. Our
resolutions are too stressful. They
are too specific and go against the
grain in our quest to be what we
are, however obnoxious, ir-
responsible or disgusting that
may be.

I'll admit, I've blown a few
resolutions in my day —— two or
three this year, as a matter of fact
— thoughl won't tellyou what
they were (lest you get to know
a little too much about me). I will
say this. This year will be just like
last year — no more, no less ——
unless I get my head together.

Shortly after New Year's Day,
I was sitting at my computer work
station typing away at a story
when a colleague stopped by to
chat. ,

”Any resolutions?” he asked,
half expecting me to chuckle and
half expecting me to spit out a
litany. Just by looking at me, he
probably had a good idea of what
my resolution should be. So why
should I tell him? It's like asking
a fat person what he'd like the
new year to bring. What do you
think? To see how many dough-
nuts he can eat before Christmas?
Hardly.

It's kind of like that with me,
only instead of being addicted to

When I entered the University
of Pittsburgh, I did so with a full
heart and with a desire to do well
in my studies. [...] I did my share
of studying, and I think I did more
than one individual's share in the
extracurricular area, on behalf of
the university and its student
body, through my participation in
the Pitt Program Council.

I took many of my tests, mid-
terms and finals under hardship
of taking them early because they
were scheduled on my religious

food, I'm addicted to work.

Every year, I promise myself
that I'll spend less time at the
work station and more time just
cruising through life and enjoying
being a young man. Of course,
the usual sidebar to this type of
resolution is that I'll try to be
more efficient, thus enabling me
to produce the same amount of
work in less time. I still haven't
found the knack.

Anyway, my colleague, a sage
of sorts, told me that his New
Year’s resolution was simple.
One word. Transition. What was
that supposed to mean? Anything
he wanted it to, I guess. What he
had done was create a theme for
himself, choosing to pursue a
more general and abstract goal
for the year. It's so simple, it's
brilliant.

So I got to thinking: what could
my word be? I poured over my
list of prospects, none of which

approach

seemed right. Health? No. I'll
never enjoy drinking beer again,
and who needs the anxiety?
Wealth? Forget it. That's too often
in the hands of other people or
Lady Luck, and I'm not going to
let the success or failure of my
word hinge on either.

But then I was lying in bed one
night, flipping through a recent-
ly purchased volume of Edward
Albee’s collected works, the
word of words, the concept of
concepts leapt forth like a tiny
bug and lodged in my ear —
balance, as in AIbee’s play A deli-
cate balance. The word seemed
a perfect fusion of all the prior
resolutions — one of the keys to
surviving in this complex world
we've created. To establish‘ a
sense of balance in my life would
be the perfect thing.

- One of the most difficult things
to do in these times is to main-
tain a balanced perspective on
the world and how it relates to
our particular situations. Every-
thing we see tries to upset this
balance, to push us in one direc-
tion or another, to make us em-
brace extremes in every aspect of
life —— in politics and economics,
sex and career, and so on. A lack
of balance got us into the Iran-
Contra fiasco. It precipitated the
Oct. 19 downer on Wall Street.

Balance. Athlete’s swear by it.
It's useful when doing the Jerk or
the Twist. I think I'll give ‘it a go.
More of us should.

holidays. I never complained. I
even did pretty well. But now
you have placed the last straw to
break the camel's back by
scheduling the 1988 graduation
on my Sabbath, which makes it
impossible for me to attend.

To my knowledge, there has
never been a graduation sched-
uled on a Saturday. Why now? I

recognize that those who sched-
ule the various university dates
are very insensitive to the calen-
dar other than what pertains to
the university. But to do some-
thing which has no precedent just
to suit the calendar, and at the
same time, dissappoint many in-

directly violate the Sabbath
unnecessarily, is a most regretta-

Of people, pigeons, proposals and Patti 

Laughter is the coziest of all
comforts; it soothes, it transcends
reality. It is the dissolution of
anxieties into a wholesome com-
munion ofrelief. It is the consum-
mation of~distorted perceptions
by a vacuum of gaietyl

Humor is, well, iffy, I think.

That's because different people
have different opinions about
what constitutes guffaw-
provoking humor. When you
start poking fun at the wrong
thing, theright peoplemight start
to get angry.

Wouldn't you just leave it up
to some bigwig Pittsburgh
newscasting team to publicly slur
the cat and pigeon population,
offending the sensibilities of those
who have placed great value on
the equality of all species?

Fortunately, there are organiza-
tions like the NAACP (National
Association for the Advancement
of Cats and Pigeons) who have a
vested interest in freedom of fe-
lines and our fine-feathered
friends everywhere.

As if Earl the Dead Cat were
not enough of an insult to cat

' lovers, these two had to just go

ahead and rub catnip in the
wound by repeating the ghastly
suggestion of Mike Levine, alias
”Captain Radio,” a talk show

host on KDKA radio, that cats be
frozen and sent to feed the hun-
gry in less fortunate parts of the
world.

Thank goodness the NAACP
president firmly remarked that the
slur was ”one of the most crass
and insensitive remarks ever ut-
tered over the airwaves of Pitts-
burgh” before he even heard it.
This way, I figure, he had a
chance to send out a posse to
round up the cats and pigeons

_ and warn them so they could

seek refuge.

It's about time someone called
for the reprimand of Bill, and his
conspirator/daughter Patti. He's
been damning the pigeons too
long. It is almost sinfulthat men
such as Burns do not recognize
the vital role pigeons play in our
ecosystem.

’ I have, therefore, taken it upon
myself to trace the mystical and
interesting origins of the pigeon
since the beginning of time.

Think back to the days of
Noah's ark. Everyone knows that
the dove who retrieved the olive
leaf was really just a pigeon. No,
scratch that. Not just a pigeon but
a pigeon‘ of great ilk indeed.

Just ask around. Ask your
friends to name a few famous
pigeon phrases. Odds are, every-

 

FRANCES
SANSIG

one will be shouting their favorite
pigeon phrases before you know
It.

”Pigeon toes,” ”stoo| pigeon,”
”pidgin English,” ”pigeon hole”
and ”carrier pigeon” are sure to
top the list.

Still, other, less popular phrases
like ”pigeon-livered” are sure to
inspire rapturous conversation
between two people at the sheer
utterance of it.

There is also a dance that's all
the rage called the ”pigeon
wing.” Never heard of that one,
have you Bill and Patti? You've
not only alienated pigeon lovers,
but an entire generation of dance
enthusiasts. The pigeon wing is a

very special and fancy dance in
which the person executing it
jumps and strikes his legs
together.

Contemporary botanists are
probably not very pleased with
you either, Bill and Patti. Ad-
mirers of the pigeon pea (Cajunus
ca/an), should be appalled. The
pigeon pea is an ancient and
respected, leguminous, woody
herb plant of great nutritional
content.

Enough said.

Everyone loved you, too, Pat-
ti. Just because your dad doesn't
like pigeons, do you have to go
around slamming them, too?
Come to think of it, you do look
a little like Marie Antoinette. Do
you think Animal Friends will re-
voke your honorary mem-
bership?

It seems there has been in ex-

istence for quite sometime now
a faction against pigeons, and my
suspicions have now been con-
firmed that Bill Burns is the
dastardly leader of this group of
anti-pigeon right-wingers. His
daughter Patti, an unassuming
seductive beauty, is the perfect
front for the concealment and ad-
vancement of such an evil, plot-
tist organization.

The discomfort you have

caused your faithful viewers, dear
Bill and Patti, is unforgivable. I
know already of two people who *
are near despondency and are
preparing to consult with an in-,,
ternal organ specialist concerning
some unexpected bouts with
their colons. "

I sincerely hope I hear of no
outbreaks of psoriasis and the
like, as I will be unable to attend

\_ to the needs of my partners-in-

pigeonness due to a string of si-
nus headaches brought on by
your inflammatory remarks.

I anticipate a mighty parcel of
letters to fill my mailbox tomor-
row in sympathy of my plight and I
those of my fellow pigeon lovers
who have been doomed to days,
perhaps weeks, of needless
suffering and inconvenience.

At least one thing has been ac-
complished by this entire fiasco.
We will never again worry.
whether Patti will say, ”They
ought to do that to the pigeons in
Market Square,” in reference to
flash freezing of our beloved
animals — lest we mention the
science of cryogenics. That
should send shivers\up and down
her spine.

When our pets make more sense than we are able

Tattoo was the mother of Pinkle
Purr

A small black nothing of feet and
fur. ~
‘— A.A. Milne

When I was growing up, we
had a cat named Pinkle Purr. He

wasn't a small nothing, actually ,

he was quite large, but he was
given the name regardless. One
day, Pinkle Purr, a black beast
with blue eyes and a pleasant dis-
position, met fate in the form of
a hunter's trap.

I still remember finding him,
and I recall the pain I felt then
with more clarity than I'd like.

But, in the course of growing
up, the death of a pet becomes
assimilated, and before long, we
find ourselves comforted by
another gentle creature.

Having had the opportunity to
grow up on a farm, I was able to
have a good many pets. The next

cat was another black stray with
a white spot under his chin, and
for the sake of continuity, his
name was also Pinkle Purr. At
first, we calledhim No. 2, but
that soon wore off, and he was
simply Pinkle Purr.

At different parts of my life, I
have shared the company of two
long-eared Nubian goats named
Flopsy and Mopsy, a Shetland
pony named Little Joe and a cou-
ple of dogs, Rascal and Abe. Sad-
ly, none of those animals is still
with me. Old age claimed most
of them, and the goats were given
another home as school and jobs
required more of my time.

Now, I live with a semi-well
adjusted mutt named Ivan
O’Flannigan Vladimir Yev-
tushenko, or Puppy for short. He
comes and goes pretty much as
he pleases, spending time with us
when the mood hits him. The
current felines, many of whom

have only the names they've
given themselves, are just as tran-
sitory, and easily as interesting as
anyone I know. ‘I

Weird unprocedure justification

On Jan. 3, Haniya Suleiman, in
the occupied West Bank of Israel,
was hanging laundry when a
Palestinian youth, racing from an

I Israeli cop, ran into her home.

The cop kicked in the door.
When Suleiman went to inves-
tigate she found the cop grap-
pling with the youth brutally, as
is usual with Israeli cops. She
tried to register a complaint.
There was a similar situation
that developed in Pittsburgh last

' year. You may remember, Pitts-

burgh Public School President
lake Milliones had witnessed an
arrest in the Hill District. His pro-
test was conscientious, and unfor-
tunate, and the Pittsburgh Police
had him arrested for obstructing

JAME$

justice. Civil disobedience met
civil law, and nobody was un-
duly injured."

Israeli cops don't want to waste
time on civilized procedures. Not
wanting to be so cowardly
toward the awful woman, he
pumped a few rounds into her
body. Haniya died.

Israel has psychic ways of
justifying these weird un-
procedures. The arabs are_not
quite yet citizens. This translates
into hedging and hemming and

yodle—a-hee hawing on the rights
of Palestinian youth. The Israelis
are still in the pre-reconstruction
period of segregation. They
haven't even reached a point of
”separate, but equal.”

These Israeli policies are outra-
geous. Israel, if they want Ameri-
can dollars, will have to take a
human rights’ stance on Arabs’
within their territory. Human
rights are an essential component
of world harmony. Without
equality between peoples, the ra-
cists will not merely endure, they
‘may someday come to dominate.

Wise up, Jerusalem.

/ames Crary is a staff writer for
The Pitt News.

 

There is a reason for this stum-
bling jaunt through my child-
hood. I was visiting a couple of
friends, and in both houses, the
cats were introduced to me with
the same formality as the rest of
the members of both households.
They weren't pets, they were
more like long-term guests.

Sitting in the presence of these
animals, I began to feel a little
more at ease with the world.
Here was proof that it is possible
for humans to peacefully coexist
with at least one other species.
The cats seem to be happy, they
are affectionate and pleasant to
have around, they make good
friends.

I think that maybe, just maybe,
cats have something to teach us.
Actually, it's something you can
learn from a dog, or .a horse, or
any other animal that happens to
be around. I have yet to see a cat
or a dog hold a grudge, and I

have yet to see one want any-
thing but to be loved.

When you scratch that spot be-
tween your dog's ears, or that one
place right below your cat's chin, ‘
the payoff is immense. The pet is
as happy as he or she can be, and
in return for that small kindness, \
we are given the unchecked love
of another creature.

In most cases, I think that a
pet's ability to love its keeper,
without any of the demands nor-
mally associated with such an

outpouring of emotion is refresh- I

ing. By letting life wash over
them in waves of happiness and
comfort, punctuated by sleep and
meals, a pet provides the best
service imaginable.

Maybe there's something we
should be learning from our pets,
something about this ability to
give freely of their love.

spective editor for The Pitt News.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 2l, l988

Q: Isn't promiscuity the real
cause of the AIDS epidemic?

A: I have to say, first of all, that
if you don't want to risk getting
the AIDS virus into your blood-
stream, you simply won't be sex-
ually promiscuous. It is too risky.
Being promiscuous in the present
health crisis is even more danger-
ous than it was before we ever
heard of AIDS. Before AIDS,
there were real dangers in being
promiscuous sexually, but now to
be promiscuous is suicidal.

There are ways to make being
sexually promiscuous less dan-
gerous. Using condoms for
almost all sexual activities is safer
than using no protection, but
condoms only reduce the risk.
Condoms don’t make sex with
people who have the AIDS virus

a safe activity. Only less risky.

Please understand that if you
yourself have always kept to one
person sexually, that is a good
idea for many reasons, but if that
other person has risked exposure
to the AIDS virus, then you are at
risk, too. You have to be com-
pletely sure of your sexual part-
ner, and he or she has to be
completely sure of you.

If your partner has been
promiscuous since 1977, when
the disease surfaced in this part
of the world, then you are at risk
unless your partner has had the

complete course of tests, which

takes from six months to over a
year, and has never risked ex-
posure during or after the tests. If

your partner has risked exposure, _

you are at risk.

DR. Rl.I'I'.l-I
WESTI-IEIMER

If you have been at risk, and in-
stead of undergoing the tests, you
cross your fingers and hope you
don't develop AIDS, you put any
sexual partner at risk of getting
AIDS.

All this is fearful, but the facts
are fearful. I would rather that
you were overly fearful than that
you risk the disease or take a
chance of passing it on to some-
one else.

There is no doubt that if there
had been no sexual promiscuity
in the United States, the disease
would have spread much more

if you have sex with an addict,
you risk contracting AIDS.

If you have sex with an addict’s

An eVfejlillg' of iDark[Q3d[l]it Rock,

By Manny Theiner
For The Pitt News

Five years ago, Of A Mesh
would have been an unstoppable
phenomenon. Hailing from New
York City and playing an innova-
tive brand of the gloom drone,
they could possibly have become
post—punk legends by now.

Instead, they emerge at a time
when the climate of independent
music has changed. The Big
Sonic Youth noise wall has be-
come the new Big Apple trade-
mark, and countless middle class
bands cling to recycled R.E.M.
riffs. So what do the purveyors of
a darkly tinged sound have to
offer today?

Uniqueness in a city of seven
million people, for one. ”We’re
the only group like this in New
York,” claims Grag Kostroff, bas-
sist. ”We get the most support
from college stations like WNYU.

So we did a show at the universi-
ty and a fund-raiser for the sta-
tion.” Their distinct sound has
also earned them spots opening
for the Butthole Surfers, March
Violets and on Jan. 25 at CBGB’s,
Swedish group Leather Nun.

The group also benefits from
their membership in the Sorority,
a network of New York bands
which also involves Kilpig, Flow-
er and Sea Monster among
others. Tramp’s is the most fre-
quented nightclub for network
shows. Beyond scene unity, the
organization helps to market the
records of these groups under a
common label.

With some direction, Broken,
the second Of A Mesh album,
has done well in the sales depart-
ment. The record has also gar-
nered favorable reviews from the
radio trade magazine Rockpool
and considerable airplay on alter-
native stations in Europe and

North America.

The album has been described
by WRCT’s Dark Rocker Stormin’
Norman as being in the murky,
layered and textured vein of
Dead Can Dance with the rock
edge of Xmal Deutschland —
very much a disc reminiscent of
the UK’s 4 AD label.

Of A Mesh, however, declines
to attribute their music to any
specific influences, preferring to
stress that their members come
from different backrounds.
”Probably Red Lorry Yellow Lor-
ry, if I had to mention one band,
though,” said Kostroff.

The most unusual member of
the group is their violinist,
Samara Lubelski, who has studied
the instrument since childhood
and decided‘ to adapt its pining
qualities to a rock forrnat.

”The violin adds a lush texture
to the music. I think its potential
is seriously underestimated by

most people,” she said.

A more conventional approach
is taken by the Akron group Slave
Cave, who play straight-ahead
dark rock in the manner of neo-
deities Joy Division and Bauhaus.

Together in the present lineup
for only a short while, current
Slave Cave members also bring
their talents from associations
with bands such as Cleveland's
Scream Theater and Death of
Samantha and Pittsburgh's F-
Models (anyone remember the
single "Nobody Loves Me”?).

Their sound is tightly molded
onto an eponymous cassette
which is currently No. 16 on
WRCT. Slave Cave cuts through
originals with titles like ”My
Witch” and ”She Screams
Release,’ as well as covers of
Neil Young and T. Rex. Though
the tape has seen some airplay,
the group is only beginning to
play outside of Ohio.

7

Pittsburgh hardly seems like a
city that would harbor a band of
European quality in its local
venues. Yet, that’s exactly what
Pittsburgh has in The Garden.

Formed in 1983 as a semi-
funny punk band, The Garden
restructured last year to reflect the
prominent influence of the
gothic/atmoshperic music of 4AD
groups. Indeed, they often sound
like an early version of the Coc-
teau Twins, one of the most fa-
mous 4AD bands.

The shimmering intensity of
their music was featured on the
tape The Shallow, which was the
No. 6 cassette release of 1987 on
WRCT. The Shallow was overall
one of the best local releases ever
made. The Garden will release
their second tape, The Burden, at
the concert on Saturday. The only
requirement for the audience
members is to wear black to
make them happy.

Big River winds it's way through Pittsburgh

The musical Big River will be running at Heinz Hall.

By Cathleen Karlson

Staff Writer

Special adaptations of classic
novels have been produced re-
cently in Pittsburgh, such as the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's
production of The Great Gatsby
last October, so it seems natural
that Mark Twain's time—honored
American tale of a young boy's

' adventures on the Mississippi

River would follow suit.

Eight performances of Big
River: The Adventures of Huck-
leberry Finn will be presented at
Heinz Hall beginningjan. 26-31.
It is being shown as part of the
Pittsburgh Broadway Series and is

said to be ”the best” of the tour— '

ing shows. .

Big River is the winner of seven
Tony Awards including Best Mu-
sical of 1985, Best Score, Best Set
Design and Best Lighting. The

Movie Marathon!

 

Comedy, drama, adventure... “Northwest Passage,”
“The Andromeda Strain,” ‘illnne of the Thousand
Days,” and twenty more. ,5_Qd a special broadcast
of Wonderworks’ “Frog.” -

. B THE &iREAif2i8iH0URi,a//3

show portrays 65 characters and
34 scenes depicted by just 26
actors.

The lead roles of Huck Finn,
and Jim, the runaway slave, are
played by Romain Fruge and
Michael Edward—Stevens, respec—
tively. Fruge debuted on Broad-
way in the role of Huck Finn,
while Stevensperformed in the
Houston Grand Opera’s presen-
tation of Porgy and Bess.

Other roles include Barry Lee
(Tom Sawyer), Walker Joyce (the
King), Michael Calkins (the Duke)
and Jessie Janet Richards (Mary
Jane Wilkes).

Set Designer Heidi Landesman
recreated her original scenery for

Big River's national tour.
Costumes, lighting, and sound
were also redesigned for the per-
formances.

The musical score was com-
posed by Roger Miller, perhaps
best known for his hit ”King of
the Road.” Also, John Richard
Lewis created the show’s dance
and incidental themes.

The musical itself was written

by playwright William Haupt— J

man.

A cast of fine actors and excit-
ing set design as well as the pres—
tigious honors Big River has
received should make for a
promising presentation of
Twain's classic story.

  The Kinsey Report's debut album shows promise

_ The Kinsey Report

Edge of the City
Alligator

While practitioners of more-or-

— less traditional blues styles re-

main in no short supply, many
contemporary blues artists have
revitalized the music with an ex-

. ‘ citing new eclecticism. Edge of
‘ the City, the debut LP from the

Kinsey Report, is a strong, though
uneven, helping of the new big-

. city blues.

On Edge of the City, The Kin-

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 21, 1988

sey Report offers 10 original
tunes; there's something for
everyone: houserockin’ blues,
slower, minor-keyed R&B, a bas-
ic rock ’_n’ roll rave-up, a gospel-
tinged ballad, and a Delta-style
acoustic blues.

On this LP, their first recording
without their father, the great Big
Daddy Kinsey —— an immensely
charismatic and entertaining
singer and frontman —— the four
Kinsey brothers’ performance is
a bit cautious. They sound like,
well, an excellent blues band
whose leader is waiting off stage

for his grand entrance.

The band’s greatest strength
lies in its top-notch rhythm sec-
tion, whose seamless blending
and propulsive energy create a
superb ground floor for any
vocalist or soloist to build upon.

Donald Kinsey, though talent-
ed and versatile as a singer and
always tasteful as a lead guitarist,
rarely inspires in either role.
Fronting his own band is a role
that Donald (who as a rhythm
guitarist recorded with, among
others, Bob Marley and Peter
Tosh) will have to grow into.

Join the Race to McKee Place

The album's high points are the
funky R&B tunes and the boogie-
based blues. Particularly in these
formats, the rhythm section per-
colates. The bass guitar is always
bright and bouncy, the rhythm
guitar is impeccably solid and
precise, and the drums are sim-
ple, tight and loud.

On ’’I can't let you go,” an in-
fectious, funky minor blues
reminiscent of B.B. King or Jim-
my Johnson, Donald Kinsey's vo-
cals are breathy and soulful with
a believable touch of despera-
tion:

I'll do anything I can/I hope
you'll understand/I can't let you
go.

His solo guitar sound balances
muscle and melody but suffers
from a lack of high blues drama
— the gut-wrenching wails,
rough-edges and frantic tension
that add up to true blues bliss.

Similarly, at least on‘ this LP,
Kinsey’s voice is occasionally too

tentative. Most at home in the
R&B-ish and house-rockin' tunes,
Kinsey overambitiously tackles a
very slow and forbiddingly sim-
ple Delta-style blues.

The self-penned song, ”An-
swering Machine,” is a long and
unfulfilling six minutes. It is sin-

gularly lacking in the dark tex- "

tures that the foreboding genre
demands. D

Another ambitious effort, the
very slow, minor blues ’’Full
Moon on Main Street” works
much better with its. haunting
Hammond organ and bite-sized
guitar solo snippets between. vo-
cal lines. With slow contem-
porary blues, full of cinematic
imagery depicting a bewitched
urban nightmare, the Kinsey
Report doesn't quite realize its
full potential but hints at great
promise.

THE PITT News, Thursday, January 21, I988

   

Roy Buchanan's latest releae shows his talent.
The man can jam

Roy Buchanan
Hot Wires
Alligator

Lately, the blues have been
regaining popularity through
releases by new artists such as
Robert Cray and Mason Ruffner
and also through the emergence
of established artists who previ-
ously may not have enjoyed
popular acclaim. Among the lat-
ter group of blues releases, Roy
Buchanan's’ Hot Wires is excep-
tional both as a showcase of bril-
liant axwork and traditonal blues
ballads.

Released by Alligator, the
Chicago-based record label, this
is Buchanan's third and possibly
finest album. The musicians fea-
tured are all veterans, having also
played on Buchanan's last album
Dancing on the Edge.

Buchanan handles lead guitar
and vocals, while Donald Kinsey
plays rhythm guitars along with
bassist Larry Exum, drummer
Morris Jennings and Stan Szelest
on piano and keys.

The band is very tight through-
out, with the rhythym section of
Exum and Jennings providing a
solid base on which Buchanan
constructs his flashy, melodic

lead lines. The LP is built around
Buchanan's wailing guitar — four
of the 10 cuts are instrumental.
Outstanding among these are
”Sunset over Broadway” and
”Flash Chordin” on the first side
and ”Country Boogie,” the lone
instrumental selection, on the se-
cond side. Musically, the entire
album is so good that the vocals
and lyrics seem like afterthoughts
(witness ”Goose Grease,” side
one). Guest vocalists Johnny
Sayles and Kanika Kress are quite
good on their ballads.

Vocally, Buchanan sounds like
a cross between Dire Straits’
Mark Knopﬂer and Kim Wilson of
the Fabulous Thunderbirds.

Tower of Power stands alone

Tower of Power
Power
Cyprus .

I really like it when back—up,
and studio musicians come to the
forefront in the field of music.
One example is the fabulous suc-
cess of Mr. Mister, who were
once a group of studio musicians.
Tower of Power is a similar situ-
ation. They were Huey Lewis’
horn section. Now they've taken
their talent, as well as a lead
singer and a band, to the studio

to record their new album,
Power.

Power’s first side shocks you
and lets you know what to expect
—— good’ music. The first song,
”Baby’s Got the Power,” mixes
Ellis Hall's great vocals and jazz
rhythms into a subdued, yet up-
beat song. ”Credit” is a Fabulous
Thunderbirds-sounding song that
has the highest trumpet blast I've
heard in a while. The horn sec-
tion really shows their talent on
this song as well as on ”B-oys
Night Out,” an upbeat in-

strumental that gets you some-
where. It really sounds like a
boys’ night out.‘ i *

The second side gives us the
Beatle—esque ’’Ball and Chain”
and ”Through Lovers’ Eyes,” a
great song with an excellent mix
of vocals and horns. ”On the
One” is a lyrical masterpiece
about love, life and music.

Power is a very jazzy, horn-.

laden album that doesn't skimp
on the guitars and vocals.

By Joel Timulak

Assistant ghowcase Editor

The man sitting in front of enor-
mous expressionistic paintings
talks about the South.

’’People have a lushness about
them as the landscape does,”
says James Herbert, writer, direc-

tor and art professor at the

University of Georgia. Herbert
has directed several videos for
R.E.M. and is the director of pho-
tography for Athens, ‘Georgia —
Inside/Out, a documentary about
the mythical home of America's

 favorite/80s music scene. The
film faithfully portrays that

richness. _

Athensfeatures not only live ‘

footage of her best bands but also

‘ candid appearances of members

of each band and area personali-
ties. The idea came from
producer Bill Cody, who was in-

v spired to do a film abouta small
1 Southern town. He'd heard .a lot

about Athens.
”Why not a musical documen-
tary about a small Southern town

showing not only the music '

scene but the town and culture it
grew out of?” That culture in-
cludes a talk with the infamous

Documeniatv Sh0WSAth€“S/ GA i“5id€a“d 0”‘

Rev. Howard Finster. He explains
how he was inspired to paint
sacred art (which has included
record covers for R.E.M. and
Talking Heads), and he sings and
plays banjo next to his easel and
pallet.

Reverend, John D. Ruth and
cartoonist Orf also offer their per-
spectives of the creative environ-
ment in Athens as does Walter
Rittenberry of the much revered
Athens eatery, Walter's
Barbeque.

The live footage at Athens’
three rock clubs is top notch. Bar-
B-Q killers, Dreams So Real, Flat
Duo Jets, Kilkenny Cats, Limbo
District, Love Tractor, the Squalls
and Time Toy all perform their
various styles of garage rock
amidst dancing and drinking stu-
dents. The bands, who are hap-
py merely to be playing for
people who want to listen,
deliver wild, soulful perfor-
mances. The sound is excellent.

The documentary also includes
archival films of the B-52s and Py-
Ion, and of course, two clips of
R.E.M. with acoustic guitars in an
old abandoned theater which
have ‘been broadcast on MTV.

As for MTV, that is where the

resemblance ceases. Much more
honest and exciting than, say,
Stop Making Sense, Athens is
about the joy of creating, a
unique/environment of local
color and a community of people

Romantics
to play
G raffiti

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

It’s been over two years since
the release of their last album, but
Wally Palmer, lead singer of the
Romantics, stresses that the band
is ”alive and well.”

To prove this to their fans,
Palmer, bassist ‘Mike Skill,
guitarist Coz Cansler and drum-
mer Dave Petzatos will be per-
forming Thursday night at
Graffiti.

In a phone interview, Palmer
explained why they haven't had
a new product out for such a long
time.

”We had management prob-
lems, legal stuff, and it set us back
awhile,” he. said.

Right now, the Romantics are
in the process of getting back on
track. They have new people in
their management and are cur-
rently working on new material
for their next album, which is due
out in late spring or early
summer.

It's a long process, and Palmer
admitted that he and the other
band members are growing

- restless.

’’I miss not having a product
out — the videos, radio airplay,
seeing our name in Billboard -
but I'm trying to be patient. The
timing just has to be right.”

The Romantics have been on
the road now, on and ‘off, since
November, and Palmer is excit-
ed about this tour. Playing live
helps the band stay tight and
well—rehearsed. It also allows
them the opportunity to test out
their new material. Along with
their popular hits, the Romantics
have been playing at least six
new songs in their shows.

Diehard fans need not worry,
though. What you see and hear
will be the same Romantics. They
haven't changed their style com-
pletely. Instead, they've just got-
ten rid of things that didn't work
well.

’’You’ll know right away that
it's the Romantics. There’s still
that certain sound,” Palmer
stated.

The Romantics, who originally

,. formed back in 1977, have at-

tracted many loyal fans over the
years. Thursday night's show will
offer Pittsburgh fans the chance
to support the band, sample their

new music and have a good time '

as well.

Hey adoring public, Happy. New Year
(late)! 1988 is off with a bang, musically
speaking. On the local front, there is vinyl
aplenty. The debut single from Johnny
Rhythm and the Dimestore 455 will be
on the shelf of your favorite record store
sometime this week. The single features
two favorites, ”Doin’ Time in Another
Man's World” and ”Radio Americana.”
Surely you've heard them, if not live, on
Pitt radio WPTS. Johnny and the boys will
be playing tonight at the Electric Banana
 Twelve Flights Up, The Cynics’ second
LP, will be out shortly.

I've been hearing tracks from it on the
radio. Sounds a little more diverse than

 Friday night, shuffle on down to the

The Boston—based Lyres are well-known

the distinctive wail of frontman Jeff

‘I4-

By Mary Bielich

For The Pitt News

The 1988 concert season has
been set up in a manner that will
unknowingly slap the city of Pitts-
burgh in the face. Local- music
connoisseurs of all levels need to
gear up and prepare for the Brit-
ish and Los Angeles wave of
heavy metal bands due in town
during the months ofjanuary and
February.

Most locals claim that the peo-
ple in this city are always hungry
for fresh rock ’n’ roll to enter
town, but metal enthusiasts will
inform any newcomer to Pitts-
burgh that the city has never been
particularly big on heavy metal
music of any extreme.

We can only make predictions
based on from ticket sales as to
how we are going to welcome
the invasion of hair—sprayed,
spandex—clad performers. Though
the bands coming to town are
chartbusters and appear to be
selling out shows left and right
elsewhere — KISS, Ted Nugent,
Def Leppard, Alice Cooper and
Whitesnake, just to touch on the

headliners -~ all have yet to sell
out their upcoming Civic Arena
concerts.

Reaction to from the birth of
L.A. style rock ’n’ roll can be wit-
nessed simply by examining lo-

cal media. Only one Pittsburgh’

radio station dares to promote
metal and does so in a rather safe

manner; that is, they stick to play-
ing the most commercial music
by the most commercially popu-
lar metal bands, such as Bon Jovi
and Europe.

Only a minority of metal fol-
lowers exists in Pittsburgh's col-
lege communities; however,
members of this minority really

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 21, W88
 

Finding new metal in the ruins of a steel city

seem to stand out.

No one can dispute the talent
behind the upcoming metal con-
certs — in all cases, the attention
focused upon the innovative mu-
sical ability of each performer far
surpasses the attention given to
his long hair and tight pants.
(Conservatism can get in the way

of looking past the wild appear— _,

ences and actually observing the
quality of these musicians.)

Perhaps the minority is large
enough to provide audiences for
two months of heavy metal con-
certs.

35 films to be featured at peace festival

By Michael Elko

For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Peace and Film
Festival, Jan. 21 through 31, deals
with a variety of topics and will
be shown at the David Lawrence
Hall and Forbes Quadrangle.

The non-profit event, present-
ed by the Thomas Merton Center
and the Pittsburgh Filmmakers,
features 35 films on South Africa,
Central America, Ireland, and the
Middle East. The project, co-
sponsored by the Center for La-
tin American Studies and the
Department of Black Communi-
ty Education and Research De-
velopment, marks the Pittsburgh

premiere of the documentaries,
several of which are award win-
ners and may not be available in
the area again.

.. Some are set to be introduced
by speakers discussing personal
experiences in respective coun-
tries. While the films deal with
topical social and political issues,
the organizer for the event stress-
es their artistic nature when dis-
cussing the festival's main goal.
”These are not bland
documentaries. The films do not
bombard the audience with po-
litical propaganda but explore
political expression as an art
form,” said Jeffrey Flannery, or-
ganizer for the festival. ”Our

main goal is to provide a discus-
sion on issues of peace in the
world and bring to audience
awareness some of the things go-
ing on in these places that aren't
covered by the American press.”

Shirley A. Kreger, assistant
director for the Center of Latin
American Studies at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, reiterates the ar-
tistic qualities of the docu-
mentaries.

”What we are trying to do by
sponsoring is to inform the pub-
lic through dramatic film,” she
emphasized. The project keeps
with the apolitical policy of the
Center in showing all sides to an
issue, allowing for the public to
make its own decision.

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the
Department of Black Communi-

ty Education Research and De- 3

velopment, slated to speak at the
Jan. 31 showing of Witness to
Apartheid , appears in one of the
films. Stubborn Hope, a
documentary of a journey across
the United States, deals with an
organized protest against the
presence of the South African

Team at the 1984 Los Angeles

Olympics.
Schedules can be picked up at
the William Pitt Union for loca-

St. John's Express outruns Lady Panthers

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team got behind early in the
first half against the St. John's Ex-
press and came no closer than
nine points the rest of the way.
The Express ran away with a
76-66 victory at Fitzgerald Field-
house last night. .

For the second straight game,
the Lady Panthers outplayed their
foes, but fell victim to an ever
changing problem on the court.

”They want to win," head
coach Kirk Bruce said after his
team's seventh straight loss. "No-
body wants to win more than

Panthers prepare to
face high-powered  

they do, and nobody on the face
of the earth wants to win more
than I do. But we didn't execute
for a full forty minutes.”

This.time, the Lady Panthers
held an astounding 54-37 re-
bounding edge, including 26
offensive boards, but failed to
convert their field goals, shooting
only 25 percent in the first half
and 33 percent overall.

Pitt was also haunted by 22 tur-
novers, seven blocked shots and
a St, John's defense that limited
Pitt leading scorer and rebound-
er Sally Sheerer to four points and
four boards.

"We had our opportunities,”
Bruce said "but we shot 25 per-

Editor in Chief

Listening to Oklahoma coach
Billy Tubbs talk, one would be in-
clined to find his Southern drawl
and witty comments quite amus-
ing. And they are. But don't let
Tubbs’ mannerisms fool you.

He isn't joking when he tells
the Pitt Panthers to stay clear of
Norman, Okla., if they don't
want to join his Sooners in a run-
and-gun shootout Saturday.

Pitt (ranked sixth by The As-
sociated Press) will meet Oklaho-
ma (ranked 11th by AP) at Lloyd
Noble Center in a 2 p.m. game,
which will be televised by CBS.

If [Pitt] wants to hold
the ball, tell them to

stay at home. i
-- Billy Tubbs

Oklahoma was 14-2 going into
a Big Eight game at Colorado last
night. The Sooners are averaging
110 points a game, while giving
up only 77.

’’If [Pitt] wants to hold the ball,
tell them to stay at home," Tubbs
said over the phone Tuesday.

No fooling. The Sooners like to
shoot, and yes, nobody likes to
pass. "They don't make many
passes before they shoot. The key
is the first four, five minutes. We
have to hold them down and take
their confidence away,” Pitt
coach Paul Evans said.

Four of Oklahoma's five start-
ers score in double figures, led by
senior forward Harvey Grant,
who averages 23 points a game.

Guard Mookie Blaylock aver-
ages 17.8 points and backcourt
mate Ricky Grace scores at a 16.1
clip.

There's more. Center Stacey
King averages 18.6 points and
7.9 rebounds. The only starter not
in double figures is forward Dave
Sieger. He averages 9.8 a game.

Oklahoma has scored 100

 

points or more in all but five
games this season. Their highest
point total came against Cente-
nary College in a 152-84 win.
The Dayton Flyers scored 99
points against the Sooners — and
still lost by 52. Oral‘ Roberts
(144-93) and Georgia State
(124-81) have also been victims
of the Sooners’ run-and-shoot
offense.

Oklahoma's lowest point total
came in a 89-87 win at Florida
State. Pitt beat Florida State_72-71
in the Citrus Bowl Tournament.

Pitt has held its opponents to
64.9 points per game, and Vil-
lanova’s 73 points last Saturday
were the most the Panthers have
allowed in a game this season.

Evans said Pitt won't take dras-
tic measures to slow down the
pace of the game. ”l don't think
you can change styles this time of
the season. We're not going to do
anything different.

”We could run with them.
We'll take the break when we
can. We'll play good defense and
try to force them to shoot over
people.”

Pitt is averaging 78.5 points per
game.

Charles Smith, Pitt's leading
scorer, averages 17.1 points and
7.2 rebounds. Power forward Jer-
ome Lane averages 1 1 points and
12.6 rebounds.~

The Panthers (1 3-1 on the sea-
son) have two other players in
double figures. Demetreus Gore
averages 11.3 a game, and fresh-
man point guard Sean Miller is
scoring 10.5 points.

Pitt appears to have enough
offensive weapons of its own, but
Evans insists the Sooners are
deeper. "[Tubbs] has 10, 12 play-
ers he can use."

Despite Oklahoma's potent at-
tack, the Sooners have been
slumping of late. Prior to the
Colorado game, Oklahoma lost
consecutive games to Louisiana
State (84-77) and Kansas State
(69-62). The Sooners shot a mis-
erable 31 percent against Kansas
State.

So what's been the problem,
Mr. Tubbs? "We've been on the
damn road!”

cent in the first half and there it
Is." ~

Pitt now stands at 6-9 this sea-
son, 0-6 in the Big East. St. John's
improved to 9-6 and 3-3.

Pitt was led by Lorri Johnson's
20"points and 14 rebounds and
6—foot—4 freshman Connie Hurt’s
15 points and seven rebounds.

The Express placed three play-
ers in double figures as Dolores
Dixon scored 21, First Team
All Big East selection Lisa Smith
added 25 and Jane Burgess
scored 10.

On the bright side for Bruce
was the play of his reserves. Hurt
came off the bench to bolster
Pitt's inside game. "For the first

time in a long time, Connie want-
ed the ball inside and we got it
to her,” Bruce said.

Sophomore guard Jill Sitlinger
also contributed quality time as
she hauled down six rebounds,
scored two points and handled
the ball very well, committing
only one turnover in 1 7 minutes
of play.

With the exception of Whitney
Mack, the entire bench played at
some point in the game, with five
Pitt reserves on the floor for the
last two minutes of the second
half. Susan Falvey, Karen Threatt,
LeAnn Burkholder, Holly Hol-
mes, and Tabatha Long scored

the last seven points of the game
and held SJU scoreless in that
period as they cut a 17 point lead
to 10.

This was the first of a three-

game homestand for the Lady .

Panthers. The next game at the
Field House is Saturday against
Seton Hall, the only team Pitt
defeated in Big East play last year.

”They’re probably the most im-
proved team in the league,'’
Bruce said, "and they're proba-
bly playing the best 'ball in the
league right now."

Cleveland State will finish out
the consecutive home games on ‘
Monday.

Jenna Hunter/The Pitt News

Jerome Lane and the Panthers will have their hands full when they face Oklahoma Saturday.

Tubbs didn't exactly have a na-
tionally ranked team in mind to
come home to after a three-game
road trip. ’’I’d rather be playing
Georgia State. We need to score
another 150 points."

But, on the serious side, Tubbs

and his Sooners are looking for-
ward to playing Pitt. ’’I think our
guys get excited about playing
anybody. Anytime your playing
a rated team, there's a little more
hype on the game. Pitt might be
more excited about playing us

than Carnegie Tech [now Car-
negie Mellon] or somebody like
that.”

Despite their NBA—like scoring
average, Evans thinks his team
can run with the Sooners. Last

Wrestlers face stiff
task from Lock Haven

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team faces its
first Eastern Wrestling League
challenge of the season when
they square off against Lock
Haven University Saturday night.
The meet will take place at Sha-
ron High School and is consi-
dered a home meet for the
Panthers. ’

”They have been ranked as
high as seventh this year,” said
Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer.
”The fact that it's an EWL meet
makes it twice as tough.”

Barring any injuries, the Pan-
thers will go with the same lineup
that has taken them to a 3-0 ear-
ly season record.

”This shapes up as an outstand-
ing match,” said Bald Eagle
coach Neil Turner. ”I honestly
think that it could go either way.”

With All—America Pat Santoro
(30-0) and freshman phenome-
non Scott Hovan (19-10) anchor-
ing the middle of the lineup, Pitt
should be favored there. The rest
of the matches may be a tossup.

”I think that we should be fa-
vored early,” said Turner. ’’I feel
that we'll have to pull off some
surprises in the heavier weights
to win the meet.”

Stottlemyer, on the other hand,
sees the meet shaping up
differently.

”We’ll have to stop them from
scoring in their weights,” Stottle-
myer said. “I foresee
150—pounds, 158-pounds and
190—pounds as the real keys to
the meet. They would -probably
be favored there, so we have to
stop them from scoring.”

The big match could possibly
be at 126—pounds. Pitt's Matt
Gerhard is slated to take on an
old foe in Lock Haven’s Jeff Hu-
sick. The two have opposed each
other before, with Husick win-
ning both matches. '

”This should be an extremely
interesting match,” said Turner.
”The fact that it is taking place at
a high school instead of [Fitzger-
ald Field House] shou|dn’t make
much of a difference. It will still
be a home meet for them. We
should have the maturity not to
worry about it."

”We have had some good bat-
tles with them in the past,” said
Stottlemyer. ”This should be no
exception.”

The Panthers traveled to Ash-
land University last night. Results
of the meet were not available at
press time. Pitt's next home meet
is Feb. 5 against Bloomsburg.

96-93.

The Panthers shot 56 percent
from the field but were a misera-
ble 12 of 27 (44 percent) from the
foul line. b

”I think we could have won
that game,” Evans said.

Evans said the key for his team
this time will be staying out of
foul trouble, defense and ball
possession. ”We have to cut
down on our turnovers. It's been

a problem throughout the year.”
And, yes, Pitt better put some
points on the board.

Evans compares Oklahoma to
UNLV. He knows they're an ex-
tremely quick team.

Deception may be Oklahoma's
most prized trait, though. Most
people may think defense at Ok-
lahoma is only associated with
Barry Switzer's team. Not so.
”They’re getting a lot of points
because of defense. They force a
lot of turnovers. Their one guard
[Blaylock] leads the country in
steals [4.7 per game],” Evans
said.

In Oklahoma's blowout of,

Centenary College, the Sooners
forced 54 turnovers and had 33

steals. « ,

-And when the Sooners get the
ball, it doesn't take John Wooden
to tell you what they'll do. Tubbs’
team loves to shoot three-
pointers. While Evans uses the
3—pointer as a method to free up
Smith and Lane inside, Oklaho-
ma Iooks at the rule for what it is
— three points instead of two.

The Sooners have made only
two fewer threes than Pitt has at-
tempted —- and that's not count-
ing last night's game against
Colorado. The Sooners are 126 of

342 (36.8 percent) from three-“ 

point land. Pitt is 57 of 128 (44.5
percent).

”It should be a great game,”
Tubbs said._

Tyson-Holmes square off for championship

You know how people say that
history always repeats itself?
Well, it does. When Larry
Holmes steps into the ring Friday
night in Atlantic City to face Mike
Tyson, the undefeated and un-
disputed heavyweight champion,
he will be replaying a piece of
boxing history that took place
eight years ago.

On Oct. 2, 1980, Muhammad
Ali stepped into the ring to face
Larry Holmes. Ali was 38 years

old at the time and only a mere’

shadow of his former boxing self.
Holmes whipped All for 11
rounds until the fight was merci-
fully stopped.

Holmes was in the heavy-
weight division at the time. He
was a vocal and reasonably
young champion at 30. He was
undefeated and took on all
challengers. E

On Friday night, the roles will
be reversed. Holmes was 14
years old when Ali won the
championship in 1964. Tyson
was 1 1 when Holmes won the ti-
tle in 1978. Tyson will not be 22
until June 30. Holmes, now 38,
is the former champion hoping
for one last shot at glory.

Tyson's record stands at a per-
fect 32-0 with 28 knockouts. Hol-
mes’ record. is a very good 48-2.
On the downside of this record
is the fact that he has lost his past
two fights (both to Michael
Spinks), the first being his attempt
to tie Rocky Marciano’s all-time
record mark of 49-0.

The main key to this fight is
age, but it also involves the two
different styles of fighting em-
ployed by Tyson and Holmes.
Holmes himself has said that Ali
was an old 38 and that he is a
young 38. He defines this by say-
ing that Ali was in too many wars
over the years. Ali fought Joe
Frazier and Ken Norton three
times each. One could look at a
list of the fighters that All has
faced, and it would read like a
who's who list of some of the best
heavyweight fighters of all time.

If Holmes thinks that this is an
advantage, he is wrong. He is still
38 and has never been in a war
with the likes of Tyson.

The fact that Holmes is 6-foot-3

with an 81-inch reach will not be '

a factor in this fight. Tyson, at
5-11 with a 71 inch reach, has
shown a knack for getting inside
against taller opponents. Tyson
outjabbed Tony Tucker and
Tyrell Biggs, thus leading to his
murderous body attack.
Holmes is not fond of brawling
on the inside, and he would be
ill—advised to try it with Tyson.
Holmes will tie Tyson up often in

the early rounds just like ”Bone-

hugger,” oops, I meant ”Bone-
crusher” Smith did in their bout;
but with Tyson's increased ring
maturity and his never—say-retreat
style, Holmes will only be able to

do this for the early rounds before
bodyshots will start to wear him
down.

Age is a factor when it comes
to power. Holmes was able to
hurt Spinks but was unable to put
him away. Now before you start
screaming about how great
Spinks is, the fact remains that he
has not fought a legitimate
heavyweight. Spinks is still a

great light-heavyweight, but he is
not a heavyweight.

Tyson has only been rocked
twice in his career, and his
19‘/2-inch neck will be able to
take any of the right crosses that
Holmes can dish out. Tyson will
have to watch out for the right up
percross from Holmes. In his past
three fights, Tyson has fallen vic-
tim to well-timed uppercuts.

The key for Tyson is in how he
prepares for this fight. As it stands
now, Mike Tyson is Mike Tyson's
biggest and toughest foe. He will
have to maintain his concentra-
tion and hand speed that helps

him hit without being hit. Tyson
will also have to maintain his
composure. He has shown in-
creased ability to wait for his
chance to knockout his oppo-
nent, even when that opponent
is often trying to do an impromp-
tu waltz in the middle of the ring
with Tyson as his partner.

If you are going to make an
evening of it by watching this
fight, I suggest that you send out
for the pizza and drinks about an
hour before the bell rings for the
first round because this fight will
not last long. Six rounds at the
most.

Senior HaUghton’s consistency
a driving force for teammates

By Kelly Witt

Staff Writer

’’I want to be remembered as
a strong person and a good
friend,” said Judy Haughton, a
senior member of the women's
swim team.

Haughton, 22, originally of

(Philadelphia, transferred to Pitt af-
, ter being injured in her freshman
T‘ year at the University of. Ok-

lahoma;

”It's takenludy a lot of time to ‘

rehabilitate her shoulders,” said
Coach David Belowich. ”They
almost destroyed her shoulders at

Oklahoma because they realized -

Judy's potential as an athlete and
tried to push her.”

”David'[BeIowich] is a very.

good friend to me. He was my
friend before anything else. He
called me and asked me to come
to Pitt. Sol came and walked
on,” said Haughton.

Haughton is the second person

I ever to win an event at the Big

East championships three years in
a row. This year, she will go for
her fourth win in the 200-yard
butterfly. F
”There’s a lot of pressure being
put on the butterfliers this year
because Pam [Murphy] is having

problems with her wrist. She
backed me up last year. When
we lose someone of her talent,
we lose depth,” Haughton
remarked.

Murphy is out for the season
and recently undenlvent wrist sur-
gery. ”I respectjudy and her abil-
ity  because she came back
from an injury where she was
told she could never swim again.
It inspires me,” Haughton said.

Having been the only butterfli-
er before Murphy came to back

- her up last year, Haughton said

she doesn't want to leave the
team without another butterflier
coming in. ’’I really love to
recruit,” she said.

”Judy will be very difficult to
replace because of her consisten-
cy over the last four years. We've

“become good ‘frien’ds,"‘" said 
’BeI9Wi‘ch-  E  I 5

all four years without the team,
coaches, swimmers and divers in-
cluded.’’

”Judy is a very team-oriented
swimmer," said assistant coach
Mary Bolich. ”I think she does so
well because she works so hard.

Haughton saidithe team was ‘
importantto her swimming at .
Pitt. ”I wouldn't have stayed here I

herself. She expects a lot.”

She also expects a lot from her
teammates.

”Through all those butterfly
sets when I thought I couldn't
make it, Judy was always there,
telling me I could, urging me
on,” said Murphy. ”I’m just sor-
ry we only got to swim together
for a year. I'll miss her a Iot.”

Even though she expects a lot
from her teammates, she is will-
ing to help them in any way she
can. ‘ _ I
”Iudy is a great person. She'll
do anything for anybody. ‘She has
really helped me understand a lot
about the sport and about my-
self,” _ said freshman Loran

.. Haughton will graduate in May
witha communications and Eng-
lish writing major.AAfter graduat-
ing, ‘she said she'd like to teach
and coach Swimming. She
coaches swimming, in the
summer. .

’’School is really important to
me," said Haughton, ”it wasn't
when I was a freshman and a
sophomore. I just wanted to get
by. Now school is really impor-
tant to me. I want to graduate.
When swimming is over, it's
over. It's not going to get me a jo
