thought to be young ’ 
galaxies, still in the
process of formation.

By going through
old records of Hubble
telescope research,
Schulte—Ladbeck and
her two fellow researchers — Mary
Crone of Skidmore College and Ulrich
Hopp of the Munich Observatory in
Germany — discovered the presence of
red stars in these young formations. The
red stars were extremely old stars, dat-
ing back 1O million years.

This discovery may prove that it is
very unlikely that galaxies are still form-
ing, and it won Schulte—Ladbeck and her
team a spot on the list to use the Hubble
telescope. _ A

In order to be considered to use the
telescope, Schulte—Ladbeck and her col-
leagues had to prove that there was a
good reason for them to use the tele-
scope. This is why they had to look at
previous research to gather information.

“Research is kind of conservative in
the way it’s done,” said Schulte-

those chosen are put on a scheduling list
that times when each researcher’s object
will be visible from the _telescope.

In addition to the use of the tele-

  

Riscil-id

According to
Schulte—Ladbeck,
these “young galax-
ies” may L not be
young at all. When
her team examined
the Hubble pho-
tographs, they found old stars, showing
the galaxies are old.

This presented a question — Why
are there baby stars in an old galaxy?

“That’s a good question,” said
Schulte—Ladbeck. “No one knows.”

This is one of the main points of
research Schulte—Ladbeck will be con-
ducting in 4 March. She said, though,
right now she has no theories of why the
old and young stars are together in
galaxies, but that some researchers hold
onto the idea of galaxy mergers — two
galaxies moving toward each other to
form one. ‘

 

Schulte—Ladbeck said she doesn’t 

think that particular theory actually
applies to her galaxy because it is fairly-

secluded from other galaxies, it is not

very big and there isn’t much gravita-

Ladbeck. “You have to do the work tional pull.

After the selection process is done, Ladbeck. ~

She is hopeful, though to have more
information in August, when her time
alone with her galaxy, via the Hubble
telescope, is over.

tributed to the revocation of the chap-
ter’s recognition.

“We are the ones [the alcohol pro-
gram] was built for,” he said.

In a press release, the fraternity_’s
national organization said the program
will deal with the nature of alcohol
addiction and its- treatment. The
“Professional in Residence” program
will last for four days and includes lec-
tures and direct interaction with Betty
Ford patients.

Alstein said, however, that he
believes the most serious problems with
drinking lies in
freshmen and the
students who drink
alone.

“If someone’s
really drunk within
the fraternity, there’s
guys to help them,”
said Alstein. “I think
there’s more trouble
with incoming fresh-
men and -indepen-
dents who are out by
themselves and who
don’t have much
experience drinking
and don’t know how
to handle the liquor.”

He said he
believes the main
reason for the
change in the alcohol policy is not the
recent alcohol-related deaths of a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and an Indiana University of
Pennsylvania student, but actually insur-
ance concerns. ‘ .

“It all goes back to insurance,” he
said. “We’ve been hit up for some settle-
ments in the past few years. Pretty soon
the University is going to question

allowing students to drink in their facili-
ties.”

So instead, Phi Gamma Delta joined
in a pledge with most other major Pitt
fraternities to ban alcohol in all their
buildings by July 2000.

“In terms of fraternities, I think
[allowing alcohol] is a bad business
decision because I think that’s why peo-
ple join a fraternity,” Alstein said. “Once
they get in the fraternity, they start learn-
ing the values.”

Last year, Phi Delta Theta and
Sigma Nu also decided to ban alcoholic
beveragesvfrom their
houses. In total, that
means almost 600
chapters and some
22,000 undergradu-
ate brothers will not
be allowed to have
alcohol in their hous-
es.

‘ Alstein said for
FIJI to participate in
the alcohol education
program and its
pledge to ban alcohol
in its building will
play an important
role in earning back
recognition from Pitt
and the national fra-
ternity organization.

“It’s going to
be a couple years before we get back our

recognition from the University and the .

national organization, but once we get it

back, we’re going to have a head start on V

other fraternities,” Alstein said.

The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity has
125. chapters in North America with
some 6,300 undergraduate members and
is celebrating its 150th anniversary this
year.

ART

represents the idea behind multicul-
tures,” said Andy Mauery, a studio
arts instructor at Pitt and one of the
judges for the show. “We looked for
pieces that best represented the idea
of postmodernism and pieces that

' would stand out on their own as well

as those in this exhibit.”

Fischer added that students
majoring in non-art fields entered the
show. Pacinda, an environmental
geology major, was one of them.

“I like art, but not for a living.
It’s something that I like to keep per-
sonal. If there’s something I want

people to see, then I’ll _let them,”

Pacinda said.

To be considered for the show,
students had to make sure their art
work met size and display require-
ments and did not include explicit
sexual imagery in their work.

Fischer said a few years ago there

which showed a penis. After receiv-

ing complaints about the work, mem-
bers of the PPC decided to put the A

ed warning about the graphic subject
matter. Since that incident, the PPC
created guidelines for the type of
work that would be displayed in the
show. .

judges made their decisions,
Pacinda’s heart sank as she returned

“I’m not sure if I’ll enter another

John Cooper, who will become dean
of the Faculty and College of Arts and
Sciences in July, said he thought being
an internal candidate (a candidate from
Pitt) for the position was a mixed bless-
mg.

“Being an internal candidate has
strengths and weaknesses,” said Cooper.
“They know your quirks.”

Anne Weis, the fine arts chair at Pitt,
seems to like what she knows about
Cooper.

“I think a lot of people are happy we
have an internal candidate as dean,” said
Weis, who expects that Cooper will be a
good dean, calling him smart, fair and a
quick study. She believes he will be
effective at leading FAS into the future.

“The University really mirrors the.

she sees as a movement of academic
institutions toward consumer-oriented
service. “One expects that a clean is
going to be compatible with the kinds of
changes that are happening.”

Weis would not comment on what
changes in particular she would like to
see Cooper make.

Neither would David Bimbaum, the
chair of Slavic Languages and
Literatures. _

“I think probably the first thing the
faculty would like to hear from the new

- dean are what his priorities are and what

he thinks should be done in the adminis-
tration of FAS,” said Bimbaum, who
added that it’s probably too early to start
making suggestions to Cooper.

“We should at least wait until it’s
closer to the time he gets into the
office,” said Bimbaum.

also is waiting to hear Cooper explain
his vision for the school.

“There has tobe a clear set of crite-
ria that accompany [Cooper’s] expecta-
tions and his aspirations for FAS,” he
said.

Anderson is anxious to see how
Cooper will see through the plans that
have been proposed for FAS and how
much more in depth Cooper will devel-
op those plans.

Anderson explained that Cooper
will have to decide on the direction he
wants to take the school, for example,
by deciding with which universities’
departments he wants to compare with
Pitt, and then determining what Pitt can

- do to reach those goals within the con-

straints of the FAS budget.

“I think that’s a real challenge for
Cooper [to come to grips with],” said
Anderson. “It’s a big, big challenge.”

Textron’s 350 UAW workers have been
on the picket line since Aug. 5. The union
said it was under a lockout while Textron
maintains that the local went out on a strike.

McHugh says the workers will return
unconditionally and under terms of an
expired contract. Textron spokesman Frank
Ratchford said 200 replacement workers will
be laid oﬂ°.

“depends on how Dennis responds.” Jackson
says he’s disappointed in Rodman but not
angry at him.

Rodman sat on thebench for the start of

NAGANO, Japan — The Swedish

its points in the Olympic, tournament but will
play the rest of the way without defenseman
Ulf Samuelsson. A .

The International Ice Hockey Federation
has ruled Sarnuelsson is ineligible because
he holds passports from both the United
States and Sweden. Under Swedish law, that
means he isn’t a Swedish citizen. A

The Federation could have ruled. the
Sweden had to forfeit its two wins with
Samuelsson. That would have bumped the’
Swedes down from second to fourth and the

United States up to second. The Americans

could then have avoided a quarterﬁnal

How the next clean of
FAS can make Pitt great

It seems that most faculty want to give John Cooper a
chance to actually become a dean and set his goals for FAS
before they start making suggestions to him.

This newspaper, on the other hand, is willing to start
making suggestions right away.

First, Cooper should have every department create sur-
vey courses that not only provide adequate introductions to
their subjects, but will also give students a good picture of
what advanced work in those subjects involves.

Many students who come to college don't know in
which department they want to major. Others think they
do, but don't ﬁnd out until several years later that the sub-
ject they thought was so great at ﬁrst is not quite what they
want to spend their life studying.

Survey courses that show students where the subjects
are headed would help to solve both of these problems.
They should not be classes like "Biology for Nonmajors"
which is meant just to give nonscience people a way to ful-
ﬁll their natural science requirements. Students need solid
introductions that include a glimpse at the big picture.

The courses should also count toward the majors,
which would entice more students to enroll in ﬂiem. Many
people are scared of taking courses that won't help them ﬁll
requirements for either the college or their department.

, Speaking of requirements, Arts and Sciences needs to '
ﬁnd a more appealing general education curriculum, with
 a more fair system of exemptions.

Science majors often end up having to take esoteric

j courses in the humanities, which they hate, during their
 senior year because they had to fulﬁll some general edu-

cation requirements but couldn't schedule anything

; remotely interesting because of their major's demanding
., curriculum while, at the same time, "humanities students
 got out of their mathematics requirement by doing okay on

 their entrance exams. ‘ -

And if you thought that last sentence was complicated,

you should try scheduling your classes well enough just to .

graduate on time. 1

David Brumble, the associate dean of undergraduate _

studies, has a good idea in trying to re—evalute the under-
graduate cuniculum. Make sure Pitt will be serving stu-
dents an education that is appropriate to this day and age.
Work with Brumble on that, on simplifying the cuniculum
and on taking the bureaucracy out of the way of a good
education. a e

 

OPINIONS  

Tuesday 17 February 1998

For about a week, all the newspaper
headlines were just about the same:
"Congress wants Clinton to set clearer
goals for Iraq."

An article in The New York Times
Sunday discussed the general feeling in
Washington, and around the country, that
Clinton has not set clear goals for a
potential military campaign against Iraq.

Michael Berquist

The armed forces of the United States
have always been the mother of all
bureaucracies. They were the authors of
the $9,000 toilet seat bill and dozens of
other spectacularly incompetent misap-
propriations of funds.”  ‘ " ‘l ‘

However, we have always let the
largess that we shovel to our armed forces
go without really questioning whether it is
necessary, primarily because of  ser-
vice thfat our armed forces provideiilor us.
Thefkeep us free and they keep us safe.

But with“ the Cold  and

their defense forces in favor gebuﬂding
their shattered economies, the question
surfaces whether we can continue to
throw billions, or even trillions, ofgdollars
to design and equip amilitary machine
that lacks an enemy to ﬁght. " .

The Pentagon, for example, recently
requested a budget of $60 billion for the
research, development and procurement
of new weapons systems, an astronomical
sum when one considers the fact that
weapons research outside of the United
States is virtually nonexistent.

But that doesn't deter the Air Force,
which announced recently that in the next
15 years it plans to buy 438 copies of the
new F-22 ﬁghter, an airplane whose pro-
ponents claim will guarantee American

 superiority well into the next century.
The expected price tag for this project

; is a staggering $70 billion.

All told, the Pentagon plans to spend
some $350 billion over the next 20 years
purchasing the F-22 and new F/A—18s to
augment,our current ﬂeet of aircraft and

. developing _a new plane called the Joint

Strike Fighter. Considering the fact that
all of our potential enemies either lack the

technical experﬁse or have elected to
1 delay development of new weapons sys-

tems indeﬁnitely (the Russians, for exam-
ple, have moved development of their lat-
est ﬁghter " 3, pi back to the year 2020),
it is odd that we are spending such a huge
amount of money to upgrade a force that
1iglgrtﬂng)w__easﬂy outguns just about every-
onééelisé-6n earth.

But the Air Force has steadfastly
claimed it desperately needs airplanes like
the F-22 to cofnliat new threats. Sen. Dale
Bumpers, a critic of the F-22 program,
pointed out: "We're literally in an arms
race with ourselves. Every weapon we
build is ultimately sold abroad."

The Air Force has admitted that it
bases its projections on what our military
needs to defeat potential enemies by tak-
ing into account weapons systems sold
here to friendly countries. The irony is
pretty scary: The United States has to
spend hundreds of millions of dollars to
build two F—22s so that we can ensure we
will defeat the one F-22 we are selling
overseas. The American taxpayers are,

them and standing_ fast

Consider the case of the
stealth ship.

Lockheed project
director Ben Rich, one

oped ﬂie F-117 ﬁghter,
attempted during the
1980s to build a vessel
called the Sea Shadow, a ship that incor-
porated the design characteristics of the F-
117 and was amazingly stealthy. In tests
the ‘ship was virtually undetectable on
radar and would have given the United
States Navy an incalculable advantage
over the Soviet Navy in the event of a war.

To Rich's shock, the Navy uied to kill
the ship because it's appearance was so
radically different and because command-
ing a ship like the Sea Shadow would
have been, according to Rich, "as glam-
orous as commanding a tugboat."

The chief objection one Navy ofﬁcer
had to the ship was its lack of a paint lock-

drance to the Sea
Shadow's effectiveness
was lost on this particu-
lar ofﬁcer. Also, the fact
that the Sea Shadow's
cost and invisibility
would have rendered a
large ﬂeet of surface
ships obsolete, putting
a number of officers
out of jobs also did not
_ bode well for the Sea
Shadow. ' .
. The cases ofthe
F-22 and the Sea
Shadow are but two of
~ the most conspicuous
examples of Pentagon bungling and waste
in recent memory, but there are many,
many more, and they likely. cost
American taxpayers billions of dollars
each year. Until we begin to force the
Pentagon to. put aside old ways _of doing
business and have it confront the realities
of the 1990s, the United States will con-
tinue to spend billions of dollars gon things
it doesn't need and pass up development
of things it does. .

Liberal ideas

Dennis

Papula

As a Republican here at Pitt, I'm
used to‘ seeing my party's position
being distorted and twisted with lies
and half-truths, but recent articles
claiming that it's been the
Republicans avoiding the Social
Security problem had to take the
cake. ‘

It was pointed out that we young
people should be concerned about
Social Security. On that point, the
author is absolutely correct. But, the
author's contention ‘that the
Republican Party is not concerned
with the stability of the Social
Security system is rubbish. Only the
Republican Party was brave enough
to touch the so-called third rail of
American politics, Social Security.

In 1995, the Republicans intro-
duced a very moderate reform pack-
age to extend Social Security's life
for a few more decades. So, what
exactly happened? People like Sen.
"Welfare" Wellstone, Bill Clinton and
union leaders skirted around any real

talk of Social Security reform. They

on Social Security area bit far-fetched

painted the Republicans as "extrem-
ists" because they wantedto "cut"
Social Security. Those charges could-
n't be more wrong. in fact, under the
Republican plan, -Social Security

spending actually went up, but thanks adding 150,000 people to the
to fear-mongering and fact— Medicare rolls. I'm sorry,
smudging, Bill Clinton ,/  but growing up in my ‘

    

and his allies got away
with the deception.

If we look around,
it's easy to see that
there are more baby
boomers than there
are people in their
late teens and 20s.
So how exactly do
you plan on keeping ﬁg
Medicare and
Social Security in 
their present forms?
Most people in their
late teens and 20s believe ﬂit
in UFOs more than the possi-
bility that we'll ever see a Social
Security check. Conservative esti-
mates, which liberals like Sen.

Patrick Moynihan have agreed with, —

suggest that Social Security in its
present form w-ill force us to pay

 

between '40 and 70 percent of our
income to keep the program aﬂoat.
So, what does Bill Clinton pro-

pose in his latest attempt toresurrect

bigger government? Immediately

low~middle class fami-
ly with a tight budget
told" me that Clinton's
proposal isstupid and
will make that finan-
cial disaster» called

Social _ Security
show its ugly’ head
even sooner.

iiilf Clinton's proposal
.  simply adds more
51' holes to the many
. already present in
the bucket of Social
Security funds.

The idea that this surplus can in
any way save Medicare and Social
Security in their present forms is a
fraud. The black hole that the Social
Security system faces is so large, the
surplus amounts to just a drop in the
bucket. ‘

On a much larger scale, most
Republicans and all conservatives
believe something that most liberals
do not, which is that whatever surplus

is present belongs to the American *

people, not the federal government.
Any tax revenue should be given
back to the taxpayers in the form of
tax cuts or used to pay off the enor-
mous federal debt, which is due in
large part to the liberal Democratic
Congresses of the 1980s.

‘ The only thing that could save
Social Security is some form of pri-
vatization. Let's remember President
Reagan's great wisdom, "Government
is not the answer, it is the problern."

_ Maybe we could try a half-and-
half private approach, similar to what
Chile did in the 1980s, or allow_peo-
ple to set up IRAs where they control
their own destinies and "money.
Whatever the true’ solution turns out
to be, it is certain that it does not lie
in the big brother approach.

Snbading
lives up to drug-
inducecl image

The primary culprit of the
delays that have plagued the 18th
Winter Olympics has been the fog
that has blanketed Nagano’s hills,
preventing most of the skiing
events from beginning on time.

But last Wednesday a different
type of fog hovered over the
Olympics adding a whole new twist
to the games. The fog was dense
and thick and in fact, it looked a lot
like a big smoke screen.

In its first year of Olympic
competition, snowboarding has
already caused quite a stir in what

otherwise has been a very tame

Olympics. Ross Rebagliati has been
at the center of the controversy.

Rebagliati, a 26-year-old from
British Columbia, was Canada’s
best chance for the gold in snow-
boarding, the sport known for its
free spirits and even freer drugs.

Rebagliati showed off his skills
by winning the men’s giant slalom
last Sunday. - Rebagliati’s' victory
celebration, however, was short
lived.

That’s because before he could
even spark his victory, um, cigar,
Rebagliati was forced to take a
mandatory drug test the day after
the event.

He peed in a cup. He failed. His
dreams of an Olympic gold went up
in smoke.

The International Olympic
Committee, the governing body of
the Olympics, immediately stripped
Rebagliati of his medal, saying they
found traces of marijuana in his
system.

Rebagliati spoke up. Sounding
eerily similar to a certain sex-
crazed American president, he
pleaded to the world, “I didn’t
inhale!” _

After proving his athletic abili-
ty, Rebagliati next had to prove his
lying ability. He said he hasn’t
smoked in 10 months and the mari-
juana in his system was actually
left-over second-hand smoke from
a going-away party his friends gave
him a month ago.

That’s about as believable as if
he said he was exposed the smoke
from watching a Cheech and Chong
flick when he was 12.

_Almost everyone blew off

Freshman Devin Meece: Pitt’s model athlete

The former J. Crew posterboy now shows off for Panther swimming  and football?

Jay Yander

Staff Wrtter

He grew up in Anytown, U.S.A.,
but Pitt swimmer Devin Meece is
certainly not your everyday fresh-
man.

Meece, 18, was raised in the
small, rural town of West Harrison,
lnd., tucked in the southeast corner
of the state.

In a town with less than 1,000
people, kids turn to athletics to curb
the boredom. _

Meece curbed his boredom.
Along the way, he picked up all-
state titles in two sports, received
scholarship offers from major
Division I programs, and found his
way to Pittsburgh, where he now
prepares for his first Big East
Championship meet.

The freshman was lucky enough
to be athletic as a youngster and to
have friends who talked him into
playing a variety of sports.

Meece first swam competitively
at age 13 years in a YMCA junior
swim league after his friend asked
him to join the team. Meece never
knew then where this would take
him.

When Meece went to high

school, he became a member of East
Central High’s swim team — a team
madeup of Meece and just seven
other swimmers.

Meece captured back-to-back
100-yard breaststroke state champi-
onships during his junior and senior
years of high school. The breast-
stroke became Meece’s best stroke
— he is currently ranked 10th
nationally in both the 100-yard
breaststroke (his “bread and but-
ter,” he says) and the 200-yard

' breaststroke.

In addition to his swimming
prowess, Meece was an all-state
defensive back, kicker, and wide
receiver in high school.

He only began playing football
during his sophomore year of high
school — the year he received his
first two of seven all-state gridiron
awards for his play in three differ-
ent positions.

“On top of being a defensive
back, kicker, and wide receiver, I
was ‘even the backup quarterback,”
Meece said. “I guess you could say
I did it all.”

Meece was recruited by a
plethora of Division I schools as a
swimmer, such as Pitt, Arizona
State, Ohio State, Louisville,

Louisiana State, Miami (Fla.) and
Arizona. Pitt, however offered to
allow Meece to compete in football
as well as swimming.

“I chose Pitt ‘for two reasons,”
Meece said. “One, [Swimming]
Coach [Chuck] Knoles is like
Jimmy Johnson — he’s a player’s
coach. Two, I had an agreement
with Johnny Majors to play foot-

-ball. Of course, Majors is gone now.

9!

Meece will get his chance to hit
the Panther gridiron this spring. Pitt
football Head Coach Walt Harris
has agreed to allow Meece to com-
pete as a defensive back.

For the time being though,
Meece is focused on the Big East
swimming championships this com-
ing weekend.

He willcompete in the 200-yard
medley relay and the 200-yard

‘ breaststroke, but his priority will be

breaking the Big East record in the
100-yard breaststroke.

This will not be an easy feat,
however, because _of four other
quality breaststrokers swimming
against Meece — his own team-
mates.

Meece and his mmates are in
preparation for the Big East tourney,

Goalie Kenny grabs 64 saves in Pitt hockey’s 5-l weekend loss
Rescheduled game turns into a nightmare; team preps for season-ending tournament

Rachel Lenzl
Staff Wrtter

Nothing was working for the Pitt
hockey team this past weekend.

First, its anticipated Saturday
night- game against West Virginia
University was cancelled.

‘ Next, the team scheduled a game
for Friday against the Johnstown
Junior Chiefs, but couldn’t get ice
time until 10:15 at night, ruining
whatever Valentine’s Day plans the
team members had.

After all the fuss of scheduling
and rearranging plans, the Panthers
lost, 5-1, in their home finale at
Neville Arena on the South Side.

“We didn’t have the shots and
offensively, they held us down,” said
Head Coach Wade Chouinard. “It was
a good game, despite the fact that we
had a tough time rounding up players,
but we just weren’t into playing.”

And it was the dreaded man-
advantage play that hurt the Panthers
the most.

With a 2-1 lead in the second
period, the Chiefs capitalized on their
power play opportunities with less

than five minutes left in the game and

notched four unanswered goals. ‘
The loss was also a case of Pitt

getting tired legs, which the Junior

Pitt forward Jake Polochak scored the team's only goal versus Johnstown.

 

Chiefs capitalized on in the third
period. . A , V

. “We were bigger but they were
faster,” said forward Jake Polochak,

who scored the only Pitt goal. “We
were worn down at the end, and we
just collapsed.” .

Panther goalie Patrick Kenny fin-
ished the contest with 64 saves, while
Pitt’s offense managed 34 shots on
goal.

The Panthers finish their season-

this weekend, when‘ they travel to
Trenton, N .J ., to participate in the
Rider University Tournament.

The weekend tournament will
feature Pitt and three other teams —
Rider College, West Virginia
University and Daniel Webster
College of Nashua, N.H.

Pitt will face Rider Saturday
afternoon, and then will take "on
either‘ West Virginia or Daniel
Webster Sunday afternoon.

If Pitt is to face West Virginia on
Sunday, it will be the second meeting
between_the two teams this season.

_In their last meeting on Jan. 23,

9.675. Alba took home second
place with a 9.525.

She recorded a season-best
9.75 in the ﬂoor exercise and
another first—place finish. Pitt
sophomore Amanda Salacinski
recorded a season-best score of
9.45 in taking
third place.

Pitt dominat-
ed all day long
despite the loss
of another strong
team leader in
Erica Flamer.

In warmups
prior to the start
of the meet,
Flamer missed a
grab on part of
her bar routine
and fell straight

down on her
head. ,
She was

quickly ushered away by trainers
to have X-rays.

“She is going to have a real
bad neck sprain,” said Head Coach
Debbie Yohman.

Despite seeing a teammate get
injured, the team remained strong
and shined on the bars.

“The bars were our best event.

We looked excellent,” said

Yohman.

Alba and Samantha Salyers
had nearly ﬂawless routines
according to their coach as they
tied for first with scores of 9.7.

Yohman was disappointed,
however, because the women’s
scores did not
reflect their
errorless rou-
tines.

“The girls
were definitely
under—scored,”
said Yohman.

could only top the
Panthers in the
balance beam
despite Alba’s
9.675, first-place
performance and
s o p h o m o r e
A m a n d a
Salacinski’s sea-
son-best 9.45, third place finish.

This was an uncharacteristic
day for the Pitt gymnasts. Two
gymnasts stepped out of bounds
twice during the ﬂoor exercises.

This is a ﬂaw Yohman plans to
have the team concentrate on in
practice this week in preparation
for’Friday’s meet versus Kent
State. ’

“When you have guys like Andy
Cherep, Mike Pron, Joe Stone, and
Scott VanEpps swimming against
you every day in practice and in
meets, you tend to push yourself
harder and harder each time,”
Meece said, showing his apprecia-
tion for his teammates.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if we
finish 1-2-3-4-5 in the breaststroke
events this weekend [at the
Championships],” he added.

Since the first of the year,
Meece earned seven first-place fin-
ishes and has already qualified for
the NCAA swimming champi-
onships in both breaststroke events
—— the only freshman to qualify so
far in the nation.

Meece shies away from any talk
of the Olympics, or, specifically,
about the year 2000 Games in
Sydney.

He says it is too early to worry
about that right now, although.he
has already qualified for the U.S.
Olympic time trials for the Sydney
Olympics in the 100-yard breast-
stroke.

“The Olympics are two years
away and we’ll worry about it
then,” Meece said. “I just want to
be a better, well-rounded person
right now.”q

“I’d like to be an owner of some
sort of business,” Meece said. “I
like night clubs, so I wouldn’t mind
owning a chain of clubs.’’

In addition to being athletic,
Meece modeled clothing for retail-
ers such as J. Crew and Structure.

“I can’t model now because of
my scholarship,” Meece said. “But

I’d love to go back and model after _:

school. It’s a lot of fun.”

So, does all that sound like
enough to give’ a freshman a big
head?

It is —- Meece has air of

deserved cockiness about him, evi- 

denced by a swagger in his step and
a ﬂair for the dramatic — perform-
