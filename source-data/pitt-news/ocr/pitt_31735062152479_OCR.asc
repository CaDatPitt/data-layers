Few Eligibles, Dent

 

 

Since less than ten pre-dental
sophomores were eligible for pledg-
ing to dental fraternities, Dental In-
terfraternity Council has decided to
defer the rushing period indeﬁnitely.
A conference with the deans of men
and of the dental school will be held
in an effort to remedy the situa-
tion according to Nevin Jodon, Dent.

Council. 

“Inasmuch as dental students who
are affiliated with social fraternities,
or who ave not made their twelve
credits and quality points, are not
eligible for pledging, it would be
rather C unproﬁtable to conduct a
rushing season for such an extreme-
ly small group,” said Jodon.

Most Popular Man, woman Still

Candidates In Lead At Press
Time Announced '

Just what constitutes popularity
was decided last Friday by 4,500 Pitt
students who cast ballots for the
most popular girl and the most pop-
ular man on the campus. However,
the fate of the deﬁnition of the word
still rests in ballot boxes. for the
total count has not yet been ﬁnished.

Counting at the rate of 500 ballots
a day, the tabulators have recorded
2,500 of the ballots. These returns,
while by no means ﬁnal, give the
following; men the lead: William
Babcock, Bus. Ad. ’31; Martin Fal-
lon, Col. ’31; Ralph Harkins, Bus.
Ad. ’31, and Robert Kleeb, Col. ’31.

The women in the lead are: Adel-
aide Hunter, Col. ’32; Ruth Malone,
Col. ’32; Patterson McLean, Col. ’33,
and Hermine Ruoff, Col. ’31.

The above list is tentative, of
course, with more than 2,000 ballots

Of those, in the lead so far, ﬁve
are seniors, two are sophomores, and
one is a freshman. The college is in
the lead with six; the school of busi-

with two. The dental school, the:

All four are good looking and ac-

Three of them are well known in
dramatic activities. These, it would
seem, are some of the qualities nec-
essary for a man to be popular with
women, since the women voted for

seem, are after beauty and knowl-

The contest was the first-of its

, kind ever held at the University. The

Pitt Weekly co-operated. with the
Pitt Panther to give the students on
the campus an opportunity to choose
the most popular collegian and the
‘most popular coed. Scholastic, or-
ganization affiliation, athletics and
good looks were not to influence the
voter.

The contest not only aroused the
interest of those on the campus, but
received attention in the various
downtown newspapers. Heck and

other concerns have contributed
prizes for the winners.

After Ten-Day Vacation

Members of Omega Delta, social
fraternity, will return to school to-
day after more than a ten—day vaca-
tion at their fraternity. The house
was quarantined after Frank Mon-
day, Col. '31, was sent to the Mu-
nicipal hospital with scarlet fever.

Reporters, friends ymd mostly
girls, kept the quarantined students
busy at the phone. On March 5,
one of the men who had nothing
else to do counted seventy-three tel-
ephone calls. ‘

Beside playing bridge, music,

desultory studying, pajama parties
and annoying each other in general,
the sick students carefully cleaned
the yard and basement. In a log
book, similar to those kept on ships,
daily recordings were entered.

A large sign, eight feet long and
one foot wide, with red ﬁgures rang-
ing from ten to one, was hung in
front of the house. Each day a
number was covered with black
paint.

Tomorrow No. 1 on the sign will
be covered with the paint.

ons. The student should develop e

.Pro£e.’.¢i¥' Williams
Court Enthusiast

One of, the best and most enthu-
siastic hasketballfplayers of the Pitt
faculty is Dr. Williams, professor
of political science. On Monday
evenings, after eating his meal, Dr.
Williams and a few other members
of the male element of the Pitt fac-
ulty hasten up to the Trees Gym
where they c oose sides amongst

 

games of basketball. They also
play games of “twenty-one.” It
seems as though Dr. Williams

proves to be the nemesis to the other
members of the faculty.

This writer would go so far as
to say that this group of faculty
members would be able to show
their mettle against any of the
‘teams entered in the inter-fraternity
league. So why don’t one of the
frat teams challenge the team cap-
tained, by the international rela-
tiops expert. ‘

Horizon Club Hear
McMillan Bible alk

Dr. Kinley McMillan, Presbyteri-
an student, counselor at the Univer-
sity, gave an illustrated talk before
members of the Horizon club last
Monday during the fourth period in
Activities bui ding. Dr. McMillan’s
talk,- “The Origins ' of the Bible,”
was featured by lantern‘ slides
showing the evolution of the Bible.

“The world's greatest selling book
today is the Bible,” Dr. McMillan
-said. “And strange to say, most
people know less about this book
than of other books. The Bible is
not the spontaneous work of an un-
dersecretary to the great Jehovah
who sat and took lecture notes. It
is the result of ‘arduous editing and
compiling.” A

Dr- McMillan traced the origins
of the Bible back to the epistles of
Paul on his four voyages around the
then known world and spoke on the
various arguments which the lay-
man could present. The Horizon
club meets in the Activities build-
ing every Monday during the fourth
period. .

WHAT MALE would dare take
his girl to the Military Ball with-
out seeing to it that she had just
the right kind of corsage from the
Victoria Flower Shop on the Wil-
liam Penn Way across from the
William Penn Hotel. And she will
‘want just the right kind to set off
the gown she has been saving to
wear to this Big Affair of the year
with YOU. It’s not necessary to
mention price, but they run from
a dollar up--orchids, gardenias,
rosebuds, sweetpeas, and all the
ﬂowers girls adore. Ted Savage at
the Pitt Weekly Office will be glad
to take your orders and forward

THERE ARE no colder winds
than the winds of Pittsburgh and
of all the Pittsburgh varieties those
that blow in Oakland are coldest.
But I have found the only sure
remedy. Stop in at Kookley’s on
Forbes street, near Oakland avenue,
and order hot waffles and maple
syrup. Or if you like them better,
ask for sausages. And don’t forget
a cup of really good coffee.

Successful Graduates
RECENT SURVEY by the Intercollegiate

of Dartmouth average $6,423 a year, while
graduates of M. I. T. and Princeton get salaries
of $5,066 and $11,094, respectively.

But as the Penn State Collegian points out

. Of Morals Before Forum

; In one of the most interesting and
. heated sessions of the faculty
, forums being held on the campus,
* Dr. M. R. Gabbert, head of the de-
’ partment of philosophy, lé_d the dis-
cussion of the second session forum
at Thaw Hall last Monday after-
noon. Dr. Gabbert, spoke on “The
1 ‘ Basis of Mora1s” and was followed
. ,  in turn by Dr. Andrey A. Avmoff of
‘ .’ the Carnegie Library and Roswell
H. Johnson, head of the department
.y_,of oil and gas production. Dr. E.
«R. Weidlein, director of the Mellon
..1nstitute, was the chairman of the
A session.
’ Dr. Gabbert emphasized the fact
that morals are based on super-
 natural means. His talk was fea-
tured by departures from the con-
‘« _ "ventional line of thought on such
"subjects and kept the select audi-
;. ence of faculty‘ members in constant
. . interest throughout the session. _
7‘ 5 Dr. Roswell Johnson, following

  
 
  
  
 

the principal speaker, stated that
“Morals help to show us how ‘to
work out the best relationships with
each other. -Religion helps us to do
what morals show us to be the right
thing to do.” Dr. Johnson empha-
sized some of Dr. Gabbert’s points
and disagreed with others to add to
the general interest of the program.

The ‘next session of the faculty
forums will be held in Room 105 of
Thaw Hall and will have as the cen-
tral theme for discussion, “The

25 Students To Represent
Pitt At Y Conference

 

 

According to Charles A. Seidle,
Col. ’31, chairman of the conference
committee for the Western Penn-
sylvania-West,Virginia Y. M. ‘C. A.
Conference, to be held at the Fort
Jackson Hotel in Waynesburg,

representatives of the University
will attend. They will leave on Fri-
day by automobile in order to get
to the opening session which starts
at 8:30 Friday evening, with an ad-
dress by Mr. Kirby Page.

The question before this assem-
blage of students will be, .“Is the
present depression only a temporary
difficulty, as some say, or is it
merely a symptom of an ailment
that goes deeper? If a symptom,
what then is the deeper ailment?”
With four of the outstanding ﬁgures
in the world of economics and in-
dustry leading the conference, the
delegates expect to accomplish a
great deal in the three days of the
conference.

Kirby Page, editor of “The World
Tomorrow,” and a student of world
aﬁ'airs,’will be one of the principal
speaker . Mr. Page has ‘recently
return from a world tour during
which he visited Mahatma Gandhi,
famous Indian liberal, the President
of «China and other notable ﬁgures.

Porter to Speak

David Porter ‘has been head of
the student Y. M. C. A..for more
than ﬁfteen years and is a great
speaker and student in the world of
social and economic interrelations.

Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics at the University, is one
of the outstanding speakers and his
contact with the situation as a mem-
ber of the Allegheny County State
Employment committee and chair-
man of the Employment committee
of the Federation of Social Agen-
cies, makes him an invaluable
speakeron the subject. .

One of the younger leaders of the
conference is Henry Van Dusen who
has addressed many student confer-
ences throughout the country.

Business Lodge Hears Talk
On “Buying Modes”

In his second lecture before Alpha
Kappa Psi, professional business
fraternity, William L. Worcester,
Jr., instructor incommerce at the
University, spoke on “Buying
Modes” at the regular meeting held
at the Hote Roosevelt, last Tues-
day noon. r. Frank Hegner, an
alumnus of the University, was
leader of the discussion.

Worcester stressed the importance
of manufacturers recognizing con-
sumers’ demands in planning their
production and distribution. He
showed the influence of the consum-
er’s choice on the production and
distribution methods, but pointed
out that the consumer was open to
suggestion and education of his
wants. Since this is true, he can be
inﬂuenced by advertisement and oth-
er sales promotion efforts; however,
there is a limit to this factor.

Worcester explained that adver-
tising and sales promotion are effec-
tive aids when they go with the tide
of consumers’ demands; but they are
of little value when they are in di-
rect opposition to their demands. An
important factor which affects the
consumer’s choice in making a pur-
chase is the realization.‘ of funda-
mental wants. These wants are the
desire to live, the desire for food
and drink, and the instinctive traits
of human nature, curiosity, and ma-
nipulation. 4

Another factor that must be taken
-into consideration is the purchasing
power of the consumer. A further
factor is an understanding of the
habits and customs of the consum-
ers. It is easy to see that consum-
er’s choice may always be consid-
ered a resultant of these forces.

Worcester gave an idea of some
of the recent buying modes and their
effects on present and future distri-
bution plans. One mode is embodied
in the realization thatbusiness can
be operated much more economically
by a reduced stock which results in
a quicker turnover. A second is
the method of distributing perish-
able products, which has been made
possible by the knowledge of quick
freezing. A third is the general at-
titude of shopping around for val-
ues. —
Worcester will address the frater-
nity on “Advertising Billions” in a
special dining room in the» Hotel
Roosevelt, next Tuesday at 12:15
p. m. I .

Debaters’ Automobile CatchesFire

By WILLIAM THEIS

Pitt's‘ roaming debaters don't
spend all their time in railway din-
ing cars and get all their factual in-
formation in public libraries, if one
is to believe Emanuel Fishkin, Bus.
Ad. ’31, who with Edward T. Crow-
der Jr., Col. ’31, and Professor W.
M. Parrish, returned last Monday
from a week-end debate tour in the
East. 3

Last Friday night, Fishkin, Crow-
der and Prof. Parrish, with two
William and Mary College debating
men, left Williamsburg, Va., for
Hampton, a small town about thirty
miles distant, where they . were
scheduled to debate.

New Theory
Talk By Evans

Describes P l a n t R u 11 By
Workers For Own Gain

 

“Industry exists for man and not
man for industry_’’ declared Jack
Evans before a session of the In-
quiry club last ‘Wednesday. Mr.
Evans is the personnel director of
the Columbia Conserve company of
Indianapolis and was asked to speak
before the group. ‘

-Mr. Evans outlined the problems
thatthe Columbia Conserve com-
pany, a new experiment in industry,
is facing and how these problems
are being slowly but surely over-
come. “We have almost two hun-
dred men in our factory,” said Mr.
Evans, “and they are all guaranteed,
without exception, a certain salary
for ﬁfty-two weeks of the year.

“We, that is the workers, have
bought more than ﬁfty per cent of
the common stockufrom the share-
holders and by 1933 we hope to have
control of all of the common stock,
The proﬁts of the corporation are
divided amng the workers and each
worker has a say in the organiza-
tion and function of the lant.

‘Income on N

“The income of the workers is
based according to their needs,” be
continued. “Every worker in the
factory gets three weeks’ vacation
with pay during the summer with
the possibility of an extra week if
he. has attended seventy-ﬁve per
cent of the meetings of the Com-
mon Council which is the workers’
organization which runs the factory.

“Thus you see that every man is
working for himself, for his own
welfare(and for the welfare of his
family. Our educational and med-
ical foundations are taking excellent
care of our workers and thus the
efficiency of our plant surpasses per-

haps that of any other plant in the »

canning industry.”,

According to Aleeth Roberts, act-
ing chairman of the Inquiry club,
with the resignation of Elmer Get-
tys, two ﬁne speakers have been se-
cured for the next two meetings of
the Inquiry. On Wednesday, March
18, Mr. Joseph, Tufts from the
Pittsburgh Housing Bureau will “ad-
dress the group on “Social Aspects
of Housing.” The following meet-
ing, on March 25, will have Dean
Amos _address.the group on,“Mod-
ern Ti-endsin Higher Education.”

half the distance had been covered.
The ﬁre wasextinguished with only
a little trouble and the two teams
continued on their way, nursing a
burned-out generator and running
the car on a more or less feeble bat-
tery.

On the return trip the car again
revolted, this time stopping, for no
apparent reason, about eight miles
from its destination. A temporary
revival of life in the aged ‘motor
carried the debaters another mile,
and then said car stopped for good!

After a consultation, the students
decided to seek transportation from
the nearest source, and so applied
at the ﬁrst house they came to in
the progress of their forced hike.
Their knock brought an armed and
suspicious individual to the door.

After the debaters had explained

generously offered the use of his

A few minutes later the students
were being rushed in the direction
of Williamsburg, comfortably stowed
away in a high-powered car. The
driver, in the course of the ride,
became talkative‘, and the party of
collegians learned .from~ the man’s
own testimony that he was a boot-
legger of no mean ability. In fact,
he admitted that at the moment he
was ‘out on bond, after having been
arrested for transporting ﬁve cases
of government bonded liquor from
Washington, D. C., into Virginia.

Their ride ended and once more
back in their hotel at Williamsburg,
Crowder and Fishkin made hasty
notes of everything‘ their question-

exactly like him. George Gershwin

That trio we have been praising:
Buente. Hatchet and Weismann,
were on the radio the other night.
They" call themselves “Three Shades

thing else on the program. The boys
sang “You’re the One I Care For”

we think Cap and Gown will be
lucky to get a trio like this one.

question of prohibition repeal, which
the 'Pitt men were to debate two
days later with Georgetown Univer-

heard the facts of that story as part
of the Pitt argument on the prohi-

A’ total‘ of twenty-six’ members of
last year's varsity squad .and about
twenty from the freshman team are
expected to try out for positions.‘

the exciting episode of the Pitt-
Army match last May. Had it not
been for the Doctor's keen foresight
of diagnosing the game of the op-
ponents, Pitt might have come out
on the short end of the 5-4 match.

‘Besides Captain Jacobs Pitt will
have Milt Cohen,_Walter Adler and
Irvin Goodman on the varsity team.
Billy O'Loughlin, last of the. famous
tennis family, and captain of last
year’s freshman team, will probably
play one of the singles. Alcorn, Ta-

other boys on the squad.

The outlook for the freshman ten-
nis team is very bright and encour-
aging due to the fact that such stars
like Nate Gan.‘-g"er, ranking number
two junior in e middle-West, and
Billy, brother of Edward Jacobs and

Due to several changes in their
schedule, the Pitt boxers will ﬁght
the Duquesne University mittmen

ginia at Morgantown tonight as had

 

‘been originally plannedl .

Freshman Majority

The Pitt team which faces Du-
quesne tomorrow night will be com-
posed mainly of freshmen. This
year, is the ﬁrst in which either
school has ‘taken up boxing and the
majority of candidates for the
teams at both schools are freshmen.
Neither school has a suﬂicient
number of varsity candidates to

, warrant a meet between the upper-

classmcn this year so Coaches Orsini
and Daugherty decided to match
their freshman representatives.‘
Pitt will ‘have as its standard
bearers George Patterson, who
gained some previous experience at
Mercersburg Academy and who won
his first ﬁght under Pitt’s colors in
the Little club match last week, in
the .115-pound class; Joe Milutis,
who also fought against the ama-
teur club in the 125-pound class.

Tomorrow night at State
the Golden Panthers will close

another successful season play-

ing Penn Stilte. Simultaneously with the closing of the basket-
ball season, three invaluable men will play their last gamejof

collegiate ball, namely. Co-capta
Baker and “Milt” Cohen.

All. three men have been potent
factors in the reign of successful
seasons and victories that have
been inscribed in the record books
for the last few years. This year,
while not directly responsible the
record of nineteen wins and four
losses can be laid to the invaluable
aid they gave.

. In the earlier part of the season,-
Arture was the bulwark around
which the team was built. As the
season progressed, the men began
working as a more polished unit

.and the help Arture gave was not

as noticeable. Cohen, though not a
regular, was one of the dependable
substitutes that every first class
team must have in order to compile
a good record. Baker, absent for
most of the season because of his
trip to the coast with the All-East-
ern football team, rounded into form

-slowly and only made his presence

felt in the last few games of the
season.

Three-Year Man

Co-captain “Willie” Arture is a
three-year letterman. During his
sophomore year, he was not a regu-
lar due to the wealth of good ma-
terial that was present. In his
junior year, he was a regular with
Baker at guard. He has been a
consistent man all his career, the
kind of man that coaches like to
have on their teams.
were needed “Willie” usually came
through. This year, he was the only
veteran who took the ﬂoor during
the earlier part of the season, and
the way he carried the team along
is well known.

Co-captain “Eddie” Baker in his
sophomore year gave all hopes of
being as brilliant a basketeer as
Charley Hyatt. That year, he was
one of the leading scorers in the
East.

A When a public display of gas‘ lighting A
was given in London in I 802 to celebrate
the Peacc;of'.Ainicns, people talked ex-
citedly of burning air. Napoleon calledit
a grand folly, and Sir Walter Scott wrote
that the world was going m_ad.

. Thus wasushcrcd in the era of gas illu-
‘. mination. It’ lasted for 75 yearsi Then
electricity stole the aﬁeld and the gas giant
dozed through a quarter century, used
chieﬂy for kitchen cookery.

Now it reawakcns in a changed world, to
new possibilities, greater opportunities.
Eighty thousand miles of pipe lines al-
ready laid, extensively equipped with
Crane valves and ﬁttings, prove that the
old problem of transportation is solved.
Pipe lines crisscrossing the country as

Thanks to these, gas men can say for the
ﬁrst time that they are able to pipe gas in
enormous quantities from Amarillo gas
fields to Chicago, from isolated natural
gas ﬁelds to users everywhere.

No matter what ﬁeld of engineering you
take up on graduation, you will ﬁnd its
future and its growth interwoven with the
development of piping materials. And,
as in the past this development has, time
after time, been first reflected in the com-

Panthers Win Over
Pennsylvania, 31-30

The Pitt Golden Panthers de-
feated the University of Pennsylva-
nia quintet in a well played game
last Saturday night by the score of
31 to 30. ‘

Both teams played a wonderful
offensive game, scoring at will. Penn
managed to stay ahead nearly three
quarters of the game, leading at the
half 20-14. a

- The well-known “Tim” Lawry and
“Doc” Kowallis were the leading
scorers for the Blue and Gold, the
former scoring 10 points and the
latter annexing 11.

The ont-point marginwas a sur-
prise to critics as Pitt was supposed
to win by a much larger advantage.

Pitt Defeats West
Virginia; Cubs Lose

 

Pitt successfully overcame its
zone defense nemesis by defeating
West Virginia at Morgantown on
Wednesday night when Tim Lawry
dropped in two free throws with but
a. minute to play after Eddie Baker
had tied the count shortly before
with a field goal shot from a diffi-
cult angle. The ﬁnal score was
24-22.

West Virginia led throughout
the greater part of the game, and it
was only through a ﬁnal period rush
that Pitt emerged victorious. ‘Tim
Lawry and Doc Kowallis, midget
forwards, again led the Panthers in
scoring, the former scoring three
ﬁeld goals and ﬁve out of six fouls,
with the later counting four ﬁeld
goals. _
In the preliminary game, the Pitt
freshman team closed its season by
losing its fourth eI_1counter-- of the
year to the Mountaineer freshman
team which it had defeated earlier
in the campaign at the stadium,
56-34. The two West Virginia for-
wards and Pyles, the center, con-
tinually broke away from their 013‘
ponents to score 21 ﬁeld goals be-
tween themselves.

 

Women To Renovate .
Faculty Rest Room

The Emergency Room in State
Hall, directly off the Cataloguing
Room, is to be renovated, according
to the plans of the Women’s Rooms

Committee. It is intended mainly
for the use of the einp10Y€S and
faculty of the University.

The Emergency Room Was ﬁ1‘St
established several years ago when
it became evident that such a room
was necessary for emergency cases
of illness. During the past two
years the room has degenerated
through lack of care, but the Wom-
on’s Rooms Committee plans to have
it cleaned to keep it in usable con-
dition. Dorothy Eige_s, Ed. ’31, is

Booklet “Copy” At Priiiter

Graduation Announcements
To Be On Campus Soon

“_Copy” for the June, 1931, sou-
venir commencement announcements
has been forwarded to the Charles
H. Elliot Co., Philadelphia, printers
and engravers for the booklets, ac-
cording to announcement by I. M.
Kreimer, Dent. ’31,'chairman of the
committee. The ﬁnished booklets
will be displayed on the mmpus as
soon as the lists of June graduates
have been completed by the various
schools of the University.

With heretofore unpublished pic-
tures of the Cathedral of Learning,
presented to the committee by the
office of the chancellor, these book-
lets promise to be the most unusual
and unique in the history of senior
announcements. The views will be
in various sizes and will picture re-
markable aspects of the new build-
ing.

The motif for the booklets is com-
pletely modern with a touch of me-
dieval art in the background. Blue
grooved leather binds the announce-
ments and the cover is centered by
a cathedral surrounded by gold.
Simplicity and dignity are the key-
notes of the booklet.

The committee which has selected
the announcements is as follows: I.
M. Kreimer, Dent., chairman; Betty
Knapp and Ben Sufrine, College;
Russell Braund, Bus. Ad.; Franklin
Felker, Eng.; Bernadette Connelly,
Ed.; J. F. McDonald, Med., and By-

Cathedral Seismograpli In

Geodetic S u r v e y E x p e r t Supervises Final
Installation Of Quake-Finder

Installation of a seismological station of the first order was com-
pleted this week in the basement of the Cathedral. Over a year’s work
and testing were devoted to the complete construction of the station, the
entire equipment and accessories of which are a gift of Dr. George H.
Clapp, president of the Board of Trustees of the University.

More

than a year ago a site was chosen to ascertain the suitability

of the Cathedral location for seismologic work. Mr. H. E. McComb, of

the United States Coast and Geo-
detic Survey, conducted the prelimi-
nary tests. This week he came
again from Washington to complete
the installation of the station. The
instruments in use were designed by
Dr. Frank Wenner of the Bureau of
Standards in Washington.

Thus the University has one of
the first stations equipped with
Wenner instruments. The only
other set is located in the U. S.
government station at San Juan,
Porto Rico.

McComb Returns

Mr. McComb returned to Pitts-
burgh at the request of Mr. John
Weber, supervising engineer. The
government expert completed his
work here yesterday, leaving the in-
struments in condition for routine

operation by University oﬁicials.

Mr. McComb describes the seis-
mograph as “an instrument for the
detection and registration of earth
movements, caused by distant or lo-
cal earthquakes.”

It consists of a seismometer,
resting on a solid shale base and a
?set of galvinometers and rotating
rolls upon which photographs are
recorded. by light reﬂections set up
by electric currents. The electric
currents originate from disturbances
in the seismometer.

The local station will record tre-
mors of the earth constantly. Those
in charge will co-operate with gov-
ernment officials to aid in the loca-
tion of any quakes of unsual length
or violence. ._

Greek Season
N e a r C lo sge

Four Teams Have Perfect

Records To Date

Four teams remain with un-
marred slates as the interfraternity
basketball season nears its close.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi Delta
Theta are undefeated in Section A,
Sigma Alpha Mu leads Section B
without a blemish upon its record,
while Kappa Nu and Phi Gamma
Delta played last night to deter-
mine which team would be undis-
puted leader of Section C.

Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon will meet next Tuesday

night at Trees gym at 7 o’clock to
determine the champion of their
section. Due to an error_ in the
compilation of results, the Phi Delts
were reported to have lost a game
last Week. but a check-up showed
that they were undefeated and will
have a chance to win their sectional

crown when they meet last year’s

champs in the ﬁnal game.
Triple Tie Possible

Delta Tau Delta will have an op- "

portunity of tying up the race in
Section B if they can defeat Sigma
Alpha Mu in their game next
Wednesday. Should the Delts win,
then a triple tie for the leadership
should result as the Kappa Sigs
who are tied with the Delts for sec-
ond place will be favorites to win
their ﬁnal game with the Phi Kaps.

The winner of Section C was prob-
ably settled last night in the Kappa
Nu-Phi Gamma Delta game. Due
to changes in the personnel of the
league, several teams are behind in
their schedule, but the situation is
expected to be cleared up shortly

after the other frats complete their is I

schedules.

difference in the technique of packing.
Note that Camels are completely en-

moisture-proof cellophane and sealed
air-tight at every point.

We call this outer shell the Humidor
Pack. It differs from the ordinary cello-

thin, it meansa lot in terms of cigarette.
