Chancellor To Send Letter,
Reports Pitt’s F immcirtl Crisis

Staff News Writer '

Chancellor Wesley W. Pos-
var. in a letter to be sent this
week to students. parents and
alumni. confirmed reports that
an increase in tuition to at least
$2.000 a year may be necessary
unless the State Legislature acts
"very soon" to provide the funds
needed to keep the University

 in operation.

The drastic 160 percent tui-
tion increase may be the only
alternative open to the Univer-
sity short of a complete shut-
down of all Universityyoperations
until adequate funds come from
the state.

Legislative failure to enact a

-tax package to secure adequate

revenue to cover operating ex-
penditures has placed the Uni-
versity in its present grave finan-
cial crisis. As the University ap-
proaches the start of fiscal year
1970. it still has not received an

Gray Submits Financial Report

INFORMATION REPORT ON
THE CURRENT FINANCIAL
AFFAIRS OF THE UNIVERSITY
IN RELATION TO THE SENATE
BACKGROUND:

The University of Pittsburgh.
as a “state-related university.”
requests an allocation from the
State Department of Education
which. after such modifications

as they consider necessary. trans-

mits a suggested budget to the
Office of Administration which
in turn makes a recommenda-
tion to the Governor.*The Univer-
sity has currently requested $41
million. and‘the present recom-
mendation of the Governor is
$38.4 million. The corrected for-
mula recommendation of the De-
partment of Education is $38.5
million. The amount finally
awarded is determined by the
legislature subject to approval
by the Governor who may dimin-
ish. but not increase. the amount
of the award.

The State Budget is divided
into preferred appropriations go-
ing to those institutions. agen-
cies and departments directly
under its control and non—pre-
ferred budgets going to instru-
mentalities operating under their
own jurisdiction. Pitt is in the
latter category. The total budget
at present under discussion by
the legislature is approximately
$2.5 billion. which is roughly
$450 million in excess of the pro-
jected tax income. Of this $450

million. it is, anticipated that

  

approximately $250 million will
be secured from the recently ap-
proved business taxes leaving a
gap of about $200 million. The
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Association Agency. from which
scholarship and student loan mon-
ey is derived. has already been
funded from the $250 million

business tax levy to the extent of,

$51 million.
PRESENT:

The University has received.
during the current fiscal year.
no Sta’te money for its general
operating budget for the reason
that no appropriations have
been passed by the legislature.
In consequence of this the Uni-

versity has been forced. in order

to meet its payroll and other
obligations. to borrow roughly
$20 million. The interest charges
on this amount to nearly $5.000
per day. If the legislative im-
passe is not resolved. this borrow-
ing must continue since both
major periods of tuition receipts
have already passed.

It is probable that our total
indebtedness on this account
alone at the end of the year will
be $40 million. provided that this
sum can be borrowed. Two fac-
tors must be considered. First.
there are statutory limits to the
amount that any bank may lend
to any one borrower: second. it
must be pointed out that the Uni-
versity has of itself no credit and
is borrowing against its immedi-
ate expectations frorn-“the State.

  

a collateral that some bankers
might regard as dubious. The
pending appropriation bills do
not make provisions for reimburs-
ing interest charges paid by the
University under these circum-
stances.

FUTURE:

The total estimated interest
charges that will have to be met,
if the legislative impasse contin-
ues, will amount to about one
million by- the end of the pre-
sent fiscal year. It is obvious
that this sum will have to come
from current budgets. from anti-
cipated-but no longer realizable
expansions. and from potential
new programs. It might. in fact.
come to a point where the Uni-
versity would be unable to con-
tinue its present rate of expen-
diture and possible that it might
not even be able to continue any
expenditures at all.

It will be seen that. before any
non—preferred budget can be ap-
proved. approximately $200 mil-
lion must be raised by new
taxes. Four sources of this money
are at present under considera-
tion. First. a tax on utility pro-
perties. Second. a tax on unin-
corporated business. by which is
meant not only the corner gro-
cer and the barber shop but also
physicians. lawyers and other
professional men. Third. a tax
on royalties. rents. interests. divi-
dends and capital gains. Fourth.
a broad-based income tax with

appropriation to cover operating

costs for fiscal year 1969.

The only options available to
the University in its attempts to
replace state aid are a drastic
tuition increase. curtailed educa-
tional programs. and the with-
drawal of most student aid cur-
rently provided by the Univer-
sity. Any such action would di-
rectly affect the quality of edu-
cation provided by the Univer-
sity as well as deprive a signifi-
cant percentage of Pennsylvania
resident students of their present
low-cost opportunity to obtain a
University education.

Prior to this time, Chancellor

Posvar had been very reluctant

to cause undue alarm concerning
the financial situation at the Uni-
versity. However, no legislative
action has been taken and the
University has been forced to
borrow upwards of $20 million at
an interest rate of nearly $5,000
a day. The Chancellor has been
forced to inform the University
community and patrons of the

   

unexaggerated gravity of the

financial crisis.

In his letter. the Chancellor

urged all those vitally concern- * I 

ed with the future of the Uni-

versity to write to their legis- '

lators informing them of the
kind of tax legislation they fa-

 vor. Since passage of a tax pack-  V,
age is prerequisite to a Univer-

sity appropriation. the pressure

taxpayers and all interestedyyvgciti-_ 
zens can exert upon state legis-; .
latorsmay provide the only mean- ‘V .
ingful catalyst to the legislative ‘

stalemate.

Enclosed along with the letter
urging students. parents, alumni
and friends of the University to

write to their legislators, will be ~

the informational report on the
current financial situation (see

mitted by Peter Gray. Chairman

CUT THIS LETTER OUT AND MAILIT
IMMEDIATELY TOYQUR STATE LEGISLATOR!

Dear Legislator,

I am writing to you to express my concern for the
University of Pittsburgh’s financial appropriation

from the State.

It has been brought to my attention that delay
in appropriating monies to the University has caused
them to borrow money from banks, resulting in daily
interest payments as high as $5,000.00.

I also understand that when the money is appro-
priated, no compensation will be made for these in-

terest payments.

Therefore, every day you delay your appropria-
tion, it is costing the University money. This affects
me in higher tuition rates and the University’s inabil-
ity to hire badly needed faculty members.

Thus, I urge you to do everything in your power
to appropriate the monies as quickly as possible.

included tax reforms. such as a
reduction of the sales tax and a
restructuring of occupational
taxes.

Which of these measures will
be passed depends almost entire-
ly on the reaction of the voters
since all representatives and a
half of the senators will run for
election this year,

It must be emphasized that any
action taken by the faculty as
such would be both ineffective

and unwise. Pennsylvania legis-_

lators are friendly to education

, and wouldyy-be genero.us.,_ {if only

   

 

Thank you,

the people would allow them to
be. An individual faculty mem-
ber as a citizen. if he wishes to
assist the resolution of the pre-
sent impasse. should write to his
representative stating clearly
which form of tax he would him-
self prefer to pay, and assuring
him that he is willing to con-
vincehis friends and neighbors
that a legislator voting for such
a tax should be the one to be
re-elected.

Past University of Pittsburgh

always winning. and by a some-
what ample margin.

Three years ago candidates
-were debating things like: should

there be a SG. and if so how does
it need to be changed?

tions are being re—run. That's the
first unexpected turn. The SG
Elections Committee announced
that the original SG election of
Jan. 23 was invalid because of dif-
ficulties in voting procedure.
which prevented a number of stu-
dents from voting. who because of
poor publicity didn‘t realize that
they could vote without validated
ID's as long as they had authoriz-
ation from the Office of the Reg-
istrar.

The Committee stated that the
election was being rerun because
of the voting difficulties coupled
with the closeness of the results

of the election in which Harris.

Miller, presidential candidate for
the Student Community Union
(SCU), beat Steve Cundra, candi-
date from the‘ Unitedstudent Coal-
ition Party (USC), by the narrow
margin of 18 votes. This was also
one of the University’s-lowest SG
election winning margins.

The second unexpected turn was

that in this years election. one of
the election candidates was criti-
cized for irregularities in election
expenditures. The Elections Com-
mittee censured Steve Cundra and
his USC party for the unclear stat-
us of the party‘s relationship with
the Committee for Effective Stu-
dent Government and for an ap-
proximate $40 excess of the
$200 limit for campaign expendi-
tures.

The unexpected struck again in
that originally there were three
different parties running in this
years election.ibut at the last mo-
ment Mike Fabricant's START
party. because of related goals
and efforts allied with Millers
party. thus creating SG‘s third un-
expected turn.

So the new elections are being
held again today in the Student Un-
ion Ballroom from 9:30 a.m. to 6
p.m. The race is really wide open.
Whats going to happen? Who
knows‘? _

.gWho’s Responsible For Pitt’s

Pitt: Close Down

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff News Writer
Vice-Chancellor of Finance Edison
Montgomery. University Senate President
Jack Matthews and I sat at the long table

in~the vice-chancellor‘s office sipping our.

coffee and talking about the unbelievable
prospect of the University actually closing
its doors. The Kafka-esque quality of the
conversation made me doubt. its reality.
Both men appeared at times to share my
feeling that this was the kind of thing you
read about happening somewhere else. but
never really believe could happen to your
university.
“Even if the University were forced to
«close for as long as two months. it could
not reopen as before. It would take at least
a decade to regain its present stature.“ L)r.
Matthews stated. He explained that the in-
evitable loss of topfaculty members who
would locate positions elsewhere and the
subsequent loss of departmental prestige
would critically damage the University
even if it were able to reopen in a relative-
ly short period after a general shut-down.
The far-reaching consequences of a Uni-
versity shut-down, which is one of the al-
ternatives open to the L'piversity in its
current financial crisis. are frightening.

FALK CLINIC, which serves the gener-
al Oakland area. would close. Eighty per
cent of the patients at Falk are indigents
receiving free care. These people would
have to seek care elsewhere at their own
expense. Presbyterian and Children Hos-
pitals would face a critical personnel short-
age with the absence of student nurses. in-
terns. and other L'niversity paid workers.
Perhaps these hospitals would also be
forced to close for the duration of the clos-
ing of the L'niversity.

The Dental School. Lhiversity li-
braries. and all other L'niversity buildings
would close at an inestimable cost to the
general Oakland area. The loss in income
resulting from a lniversity clos_ing could
cripple the economy of the surrounding
community.

Since the Lniversity is one of the lead-
ing employers in Pittsburgh. its closing
would leave thousands unemployed.

ONE OF THE most tragic conse-
quences of the possible shut—down of the
L niversity would be the thousands of stu-
dents who would be deprived of an educa-
tion. Even if the University is able to avoid
a complete shut—down. thousands of stu-
dents who now attend the L'niversity with

afford the $2.000 or $3.000 tuition it would
be necessary to charge in order to oper-
ate the Lniversity independently. nor
would the L'niversity be in a position to of-
ter financial assistance to those students.

if the L'niversity does not receive an ap-
propriation from the State Legislature
very soon to cover its operating expendi-
tures. the possibility of the L'niversity clos—-
ing its doors is more than remote. Even if
the l'niversity does not actually close down
completely. it will. in effect. be closed to
thousands of Pennsylvania residents who
now are able to attend classes. . 7‘

in order for the Lniversity to operate
without state monies. the Lniversity would
have to be changed into a liberal arts col-
lege for six or seven thousands students
with tuition at $2.000 or $3.000 a year.

THESE ARE not idle speculations. but
frightening realities. The truth is alarming.
yet it must be accepted by students. fac-
ulty and administration. It is crucial that
appropriate legislation be passed soon.
very soon. Time is running out and further
inaction will c'riticall_v damage the Uni-
versity.

With the advent of 1970. the L'niversity
administration has been forced to admit to
the desparate truth of the financial crisis.

thews and l simply discussed hard real-
ities. unbelievable but true alternatives
that face the L‘nivers=ity in this unparalled
financial dilemma.

There is still hope that the legislature
will come through with an appropriation in
time to avert any drastic actions by the
l niversity. But. it is not a very bright hope.
The upcoming gubernatorial election and
other cloudy political issues tfireaten to

prevent any action on tax legislation until’

alter a new governor is elected in .\'ovem-
ber. 1970.

IT IS UP to students. parents. faculty
and concerned citizens of the Oakland
community to write to their legislators
now and demand action on the tax bill they
favor. Students should inform their par-
ents of the gravity of the situation if they
are not yet aware of it. and ask them to
write letters to the men in Harrisburgh.
The time to act is now and not after the
Lniversity has been shut-down.

The financial crisis is real and not a
nightmare that will fade away by wishing
it gone. Write letters. demand action. and
pressure your legislators into saving your
Lniversity for you.

time last year in response to.ir-
responsible student actions. The
administration also reminded us
constantly that the State had
threatened to cut our state appro-
priation if there was any more ir-
responsible student action.

SO ‘NOW, our responsible State
Legislators have sat for seven
months without appropriating
monies to the four state-related

Universities. The responsible ad- .

ministration did all in its power
to keep this problem as toned
down as they possibly could so the
responsible faculty wouldn’t seek
employment elsewhere.

Meanwhile. the responsible

extremely knowledgeable in the
field of big business. banking. and
law. and therefore should be run-

help from irresponsible students.
are doing nothing about getting

their cronies in Harrisburg mov-
mg.

' So what‘s going to happen‘? Ole
Pitt——-yeah. hail to Pitt and all that
jazz—-is going to close its doors
forever. Why? Because the ma-
jority of us remained silent long
enough to let it happen.

AND WHENthey close down the
University. people will realize
once and for all that there was no
such thing as the University of
Pittsburgh. except faculty. stu-
dents and administrators. It was
merely a section of the city where
these people came together to ed-
ucate students.

As they prepare the Cathedral
of Learning to be launched into
outer space as the first orbiting
educational space station. people
will realize that they had a voice
in policy-making while the Uni-
versity existed. but their failure
to use it‘ led to the downfall of the
school.

As students fill out applications
to other schools; as faculty seek
employment elsewhere; as ad-
ministrators and Trustees mum-
ble and double-talk about state po-
litics and offer other flimsy ex-
cuses, they will all begin to realize
that there is no such thing as the
state of Pennsylvania except a
group of people living in a certain
geographic area. who have elected
men to decide their future taxes.
benefits. appropriations. laws and
destiny.

AND WHEN the media reports
the news of four Pennsylvania
Universities closing their doors.
the panic will result in the nation
realizing just what Pennsylvani-
ans already realized — the the
whole United States of America
is nothing more than a group of
people. living in one country. who
have given a select group of peo-
ple the power to decide their fu-
ture.

Voice From The Ghetto

Officer

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI

l:Larly one morning last l)ecember. the police.
unwai‘.ranted. thundered into the home of one of my
clients. taking pictures. snooping into every room.
and arresting two young mothers on unbased
charges of criminal neglect. Last night three young
boys were working on a car in a— vacant lot near their
home when the police pulled in and clubed and pis-
tol whipped all three boys. and threatened their
mother. who had gone to the lot to see what all the
trouble was about. Tonight a policeman will be
struck in the head with a brick while tr_ving to do his
job and patrol the streets of the angry ghetto.

Conditions have changed in the ghetto to where a
policeman must also be psychology- and sociology-
oriented. Theres no getting around it. The streets
are crowded. the atmosphere is explosive. and so-
ciety ‘s ills are becoming more and more complex.

IN SMALL suburban communities. the police-
man's role is similar to that of the early city police-
man. He is friendly. well-known. and bends to the
wishes of the coiimiiinity he serves and lives in. The
ghetto policeman has no such luck. He works a
neighborhood straiige to him. almost like another
city. Nobody knows him. cares about him. 01‘. for
that matter. likes him or what he represents. Be-
cause of this strange and dangerous territory he pa-
li‘ols. the, glieito policemaii is frequently hostile
and unsy mpatlieiic toward people he contacts in the
iieigliborhood. and so they are toward him. ,

Friendly

"which brings us to the city policemans person-
ality. What kind of man is he‘? He is. typically. of
average intelligence. and from a poor. ghetto—like
background himself. He was lucky to be able to find
a job which requires no formal education. yet en-
ables him to earn a good-enough salary to buy a
s.nall home in a pocket of the city inhabited by men
with similar-paying jobs: truck drivers. mailmen.
factory foremen and the like. These are all the peo-
ple who have made the escape from the ghetto. who
resent everything the ghetto is. and who see the
ghetto dwellers as a threat to their job security and
what minimal social status they have achieved.

' They often resent the black man for trying to move

up from the bottom rung in the social ladder.
THIS IS all compounded by the fact that police-

-men are untrained in dealing with people. The are

law enforcement officers. well trained in forceably
apprehending criminals. but this is just not enough.
They must be able to overcome their own prejudices
and beliefs. to be almost .superhuman. if the people
they serve are to be treated fairly.

'l‘hei'e is an answer to the problem. and it is not
necessaiily a pay raise. livery policeman trained
for an inner—ciiy position should be required to pass
a university course of study in the areas of psychol-
ogy. sociology. and Black culture. it should be a pro-
gram that will mold the personalities and responses
of the police so that individual policemen will be in
understanding of the people they serve. and be able
to react in the most effective and humane way to
llic domestic and social p‘l_’t)l)‘lt‘lll.~‘ tliat_ Aiiiei‘it*;i

GE Worliers Answer Miller

Editor. The Pitt News:

We do not think Miss Miller is
fairly or adequately exposing the
case for GE or its employees."
Therefore. as both students of the
University School of General
Studies and employees of General
Electric. we wish to register our
opinion. for publication in The Pitt
News as follows:

In the January 26. 1970. issue of
The Pitt News, Ann Miller urged
all members of the University to
boycott GE products in lieu of sev-
eral claims presented in her arti-
cle. and in the interest of the
"common worker" aspect.

However. Miss Miller's claims
are grossly inaccurate and pre-
sented in this context to obscure
the facts behind the strike.

First, she claims that General
Electric "paid $3.95 per share of
stock" last _vear——this is not so.
rather. GE declared $3.95 net
earning per share and paid $2.60
dividends per share.

Second, Miss Miller claims "20
years ago GE managed to split the
UE which was the only union at
that time.“ This again is not so—.~
the UE was said to have com-
munistic leaders; therefore. the
IUE was formed. and any mem-
ber of the UE could leave and join
the IUE. GE had nothing to do
with this.

Third, she claims that General
Electric wages are falling far be-
hind the cost of living. This is sim-
ply not true. Estimates of the in-
crease in the consumer Price In-
dex in 1970 by leading U.S. econ-
omists are averaging between
four and five per cent. GE’s new
offer amounts to an average wage
increase in the first year of the
contract. at least 2.5 per cent over
the CPI forecast, i.e.. 7.5 per cent.

Further. the new offer provides
basic" wage increases plus cost of

living adjustments in the second .

and third years of the contract.

Fourth, Miss Miller accused
GE of using take it or leave it bar-
gaining. known as "Boulwarism."

.Union officials were especially

critical of the GE practice of mak-
ing a package proposal and com-
municating its content to their em-
ployees. They argued repeatedly
that GE should give them advance
notice. that GE should withhold
public communication while they
considered the offer. and that GE
should be willing to negotiate on
its elements. piece by piece. with-
out regard for total.

During the last weeks of No-
vember GE met with union nego-
tiators to find out what was
wrong. in their eyes. with the orig-
inal proposal. GE extracted the
principal employee dissatisfac-
tions as union officials saw them.

After evaluating these priori-
ties GE presented the elements of
a new proposal orally to the un-
ion-—not in a written package. GE
said they would withhold public
communication for at least two

days while the union thought over
the ideas. GE encouraged union of-
ficials to come back to the table
and negotiate with them on these
elements—to tell GE what they
liked and didn't like. and what
they thought ought to be changed.
All this is the way the union said
it should be done.

You know what happened. GE
got an overnight rejection and an
absolute refusal to discuss the in-
dividual elements and the propos-
al. Union officials promptly is-
sued a_ press release condemning
GE‘s proposal as “an insult“ and
"worse than the last offer.“ They
came back with a counter propos-
al which compressed into a 16-
month period the major demands
they had made earlier for a 30-
month contract.

This futile and frustrating ef-
fort on GE‘s part to bargain with
the union officials the way they
said they liked to do it should
prove that it is not GE’s method
of bargaining they object to. but
its GE's refusal to just keep add-
ing "more“ to the package. This
demonstrates clearly that "Boul-
warism" and the "take it or leave
it" bargaining are just convenient
catch-phrases union officials use
when they don‘t get all they want.
So “Boulwarism" is really not an
issue in the strike. it is irrelevant
and has been used by union offi-
cials to obscure the real goals.

Finally, Miss Millers deep con-
cern for the common worker
should realize that in the long run.
boycotts almost always injure the
very people they are supposed to
help. In the boycott of GE pro-
ducts. some customers for GE
goods and services will turn to
hundreds of domestic and foreign
competitors who are always ag-
gressively seeking more sales.
When the boycott is over. some of
these customers will come back
to General Electric. Some will not.

Lost customers mean lost busi-
ness. and lost business means lost
jobs. Thus. both General Electric
and its employees suffer lasting
injury.

Astronomy 12

Class De fended

Editor. The Pitt News:

Last term I attended Astrono-
my II. This course contained the
classical material for a basic in-
troductory course in Astronomy——
but it was taught in a manner
which isiunique to those we call
good teachers. We were taught to
understand why and how rather
than just memorizing trivial facts
that all of us would forget the day
after the exam. Mr. Nelson knew
how to awaken interest in us for
the stars and made us aware that
they weren‘t just pin points of
light. He created quite an inter-
est as can be seen by the amount
of students attending Astronomy
12. I. too. am taking this course
and the format of exploring intelli-
gent life in the universe makes me
think. Something everyone should
do occasionally. Why must we al-
ways have things in the status
quo‘? Why can’t the new and ex-
citing approach he used in edu-
cation as Mr. Nelson uses it rather
than the stale unimaginative atti-
tude of so many instructors? Why

must education be a bore? It real-

ly is exciting—let it be.

P.S.: To the Astronomy Depart-
ment: If you want to teach a
course in the classical manner. do
it. but don’t eliminate a good
thing——add to it!

"Free Speech”

Just a Guise

Editor. The Pitt News:

Once again. the campus totali-
tarians who parade their verbal
excesses under the guise of “free
speech" have shown their true col-
ors. In obstructing the right of
those students interested to se-
cure employment interviews with
the Central Intelligence Agency.
these two-bit revolutionaries have
demonstrated that the “morality”
of their position is based upon the
same morality that guided their
illustrious predecessors. Hitler
and Stalin. Their creed is simple:
repression of those with they dis-
agree.

Fortunately. no real harm was
done. The CIA‘s policy of with-
drawal in cases such as this will
enable the agency to contact in-
dividually those students who. ex-
ercising their right of free choice.
requested interviews with them.

But. if concerned students and
administrators do not act now to
control the emotional rampages
of these would-be petty dictators
then academic freedom and free-
dom of choice are in peril. The
teapot tyrants of the left must be
withstrained from imposing their
own warped views upon the ma-

jority of the campus community. _

or we lose our right as free citi-
zens to decide our futures as we
wish. and turn that decision over
to intellectual midgets whose only

 "The Typists”--Like lFillet Mignon

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Contributing Critic

l -While working at a theatre in
New York a few years ago, a

very good friend of mine said,

 “you must come to this work-
w shop I’ve just joined’, It’s mar-
« velous!” With some hesitation I

 Ty agreed, and found myself in a

seedy flat surrounded by ten or

Etening to their director.

. At the question, “how would

widened, he raised his fist in a

 classic pose and said.  boy.
good theatre is like a juicy fil-

what and asked. “Why do you
j I‘ make suchra comparison to food?"

And he answered, "my boy. act-
ing is my meat-and right now I

~ -am very hungry!“

At this 1 coughed. smilled

the same, in honor of this
colorful director (who, I under-
stand, is doing quite well today)

"Typists" by Murray Schisgal
was successfully received off-
Broadway in 1963. In 1970 it
survives as being a very enter-
taining and quite amusing piece
of theatre. It is basically a well
written play-however in spots a
little too much to the pointand
in other places somewhat less
than complete for my own com-
fort. It is, however. to say the
least. one of the most interest-
ing and enjoyable produc-

tions that the "underground the-
atre" has done this season.

it was a busy week on the inter-

Mr. Humphrey at the dinner hon-

notorious mayor of Chicago. Rich-

  ‘Paulist.?

It’s easy to tell a Paulist. Just
talk with him.

The first thing you notice is
that he’s contemporary. He
lives today, but plans tomorrow
with the experience and knowl-
edge of yesterday. That‘s a
Paulist characteristic: the abil-
ity to move with the times and
to meet the challenges of each
era.

A Paulist is also the mediator
of his age: he tries to bring to-
gether the extremes in today‘s
world and the Church, the lib-
erals and the moderates, the
eternal and the temporal.

Next, he is very much an indi-
vidual. It sets him apart imme-
diately. He has his own partic-
ular talents and abilities -— and
he is given freedom to use them.

view. Vietnam is the "only signi-
ficant foreign policy question."

Looking at President Nixons
handling of the war. McCarthy
noted “no change in policy. just a
projection of what Johnson said
he‘d do." Explaining the lessened
criticism of the present adminis-
tration over the last. McCarthy
isolated several factors that have
worked in Nixon's favor: John-
son's withdrawal from the Presi-
dential race and Nixon‘s seeming
inheritance of the latter‘s policy.
the withdrawal of some L’. S.
troops from Vietnam. the Ameri-
can people have been led to be-
lleve that meaningful negotiations
are going on in Paris and "you
shouldn’t shake the tree. though
the negotiations aren‘t very signi-
ficant."

Commenting on the draft lot-
tery. McCarthy said. “Using the
lottery. the basis of chance. for
the armed services. is desirable:
whether the particular device that
is being used is the best is another
question." Although he feels that
such actions should start in Con-
gress and be tested in the courts.

   

McCarthy praised the judicial de-
velopment of selective objection
to military service on non-reli-
gious grounds.

When a reporter questioned
whether students have lost a sense
of national identity. McCarthy
said. "The bulk of them still are
committed to the public good and
stand ready to help in a Presiden-
tial ele'ction——too bad they start
out at that level." Student power.
however. depends on the issues.
“The commitment is there.“ Mc-
Carthy reiterated. "All we have
to do is open up the process."

Refusing to comment directly
on the "Chicago Seven Trial.“ Mc-
Carthy expressed concern for the
use of the charge of "conspiracy."
using as an example the "Spock-
Coffin Trial." "if you do a bad
thing in conspiracy it doesnt
make it any worse than if you did
italone."

A boxing or wrestling fan doubles his pleasure when he

Panther victory didn‘t disappoint an admirer of physical contact.

That an all-out brawl didn’t come about can only be credited
to the poise and level—headedness of Coach Ridl.

the battle.’ the officials called a

Horse turned out to be the real
winner of the occasion when he
pulled his second fish of the sea-
son off the floor.

Midway through the first half,
tempers had also risen to a near
breaking point. Tartan forward
Dave Stobbe kocked center Paul
O’Gorek onto the hardwood at
midcourt. Several players from
both sides were pulled apart at
this stage, and a cry echoed from
the end of the Panther bench, “It’s
the third time he’s done that ref.”

it seemed only a matter of time
until the contest would degenerate
to last seasons final at C-§\lL'.

  
   
     

  

Fran Webster, had he lived a 100 years ago, probably
would have devised a defensive strategy to save the day at

the Alamo.

As Coach Buzz Ridl’s assistant, Webster’s aim is to
perfect a complex mixed-defense. Meanwhile, the recent
jelling of the Panther squad is due to, at least in part, the
taunting defensive set-up.

When he coached Hickory High School in 1961’, he be-
came the first high school coach in Western Pennsylvania
to institute the switching defense.

Four years ago at Westminster, Ridl and Webster fun-
neled their efforts into developing the unorthodox defense.

"What we’re tyring to do,” mention-
ed Webster in a soft, near-whisper, “is
to keep ahead of the offense. We make
them do what we want them to do, not
what they want to do. We can anticipate
the offensive reactions better that

9?

way.

 

. Webster
"Since we've started to jell, no team, with the excep-
tion of Westminster, has done what they wanted to against

us——not even St. John’s. St. John’s beat us on the offensive
boards?’ I '

Webster spends his energy combining the man-to-man
and zone defenses -to his greatest advantage. He’s perpet-
ually adding minute details to an already intricate system.

The eager defense may be deceiving the rival offenses
out of their pants, but the Panther players are also going
through a grind in adapting to Webster’s philosophy.

“Everything we’re doing is hard work.“ he forcibly
remarked. '

“It takes two or three years for a player to master our
defense. It’s difficult for a kid to do everything we ask
when he comes out of a conventional defense. Yet, the kids
have been terrific so far.”

The Panther switches and mixes only stir into motion
in specific instances. In each case. every defensive player
has a designated responsibility. In order to fulfill his du-
ties in the numberless situations. a player must utilize his
absolute concentration and co-ordination.

Two examples of a key that might set the defense into
motion against the opposition’s attack might be (1) a point
on the floor where the ball came from. or (2) another point
where the ball has arrived.

“One thing that I definitely want to tell you,” said
Webster as he emphasized his statement by pointing his
finger, “is that there isn’t a defense in the country that
can't be beat on a given night. Our defense can look pitiful
if the opposition’s offense is jelling just right. It’s an offen-
sive game; at times there's nothing you can do.”

He failed to mention. however. that if he continues to

mold the defense into a fine machine, there mightn’t be
much that future Panther opponents will be capable of
doing. '

Last year bloody noses and bruis-
ed bodies were the results of an
all-out fist fight involving the
Panthers. the Tartans and several
enraged tans. A .

.\evertheless. with the excep-
tion of some pushing and tripping.
the game never developed into a
(golden (gloves match.

Ridl later mentioned, “I was
concerned about a fight, but I
thought that we could keep the
game under control.” -

Meanwhile. Assistant Coach
Webster emphasized concern that
the Tartans‘ roughness might up-
set the cagers‘ play and give C-ML’
a psychological advantage.

Fourth Straight

Cubs Run To Triumph

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Tim (;'rgurich's Cub began to run early last night
against the Carnegie-Mellon freshmen. and the Lit-
tle Tartans fell out of their game almost before it
started. The Cubs registered an 80-59 triumph.

C-ML"s frosh squad held the lead twice in the en-
counter iat 4-3 and 6-5». But Bill Sulkowskis basket
with about four minutes into the game put the Cubs
ahead to stay. I

The lead was steadily increased until the Cubs
showed a 39-24 advantage at half-time. They added
six more points to their lead in a somewhat slower
second half.

Grgurich’s quintet moved away from the Little 3

Tartans via numerous steals that resulted in layups.
Official statistics aren’t complete for the frosh
games, but the Cubs’ 35 field goals hint that their
shooting percentage was high.

The Little Tartans had only 21 two-pointers and
would have really been slaughtered if they hadn‘t
scored on 17 of 18 free throw attemps.

"Were going to run if we can." Llrgurich said
after the win. "We've got the guys who can do it. it's
just like Point Park. We could run against them.“

The Cubs produced their best offensive effort
against Point Park, scoring 91 points in the easy
victory.

The individual scoring for the Cubs was delicate-
ly balanced among four of the squads five starters.
Xill Sulkowski. _.\Iarv Abrams. and Buzzy Harrison
contributed 15 points each. and Carl Morris con-
nected tor 14.

Strangely. the other starter Don Wilson didn‘t
score a point. He made many of the steals that start-
ed the fast breaks that put the digits on the score-

‘board. though.

“We average that many,” Grgurich said, re-
ferring to the steals which be estimated at being
“20-some.” “We know we cando that.”

When the C-ML’ frosh could hold on to the ball.
two of their cagers were able to hit the hoops enough
to reach double figures. Mike Conrad scored 15
points and Len Benson tallied 13.

The Little Tartans" loss was their eighth straight
this winter. They haven't won any yet.‘

The lop-sided affair also marked the Cubs’ fourth
win in the last four games. That hot streak came af-

ter the frosh lost their first three games of the 1970
season.

"We're improved." Grgurich said. "Yes. we've
improved a lot since the beginning of the season.
Were working together and our passing's better."

All of the improvement began to take the form
of victory against the Duquesne frosh a couple
weeks ago when the Cubs upset the Little Bluffites.
88-85. in a Field House tilt.

In the locker room Grgurich told the club to wor-
ry about nothing but their school progress and their

next game, which is against the Little Dukes on their I

home floor, the Civic Arena, Saturday night.

The Cubs were scheduled to play their home end
of a two—game series with Robert Morris tomorrow
night. but that game has been switched to Feb, 19.

Another

Game?
By Martha Hartle

Sports Editor

As a ten year-old hopeful on a local YMCA team,
Dave Wessel started out as a swimmer. But a shortage
of available drivers gave him a chance to move from
the swimming lanes to the diving boards.

Today, Wessel is the star diver on Coach Bill Grant’s
varsity swim team and he’s also touted as one of the top
drivers in the East.

A junior, Wessel holds both the varsity and Trees Pool
ecords in the one meter and three meter driving events.
He also owns the three» meter record at Temple and West
Virginia and both the three and one-meter marks at Penn
State.

At this stage of his development, Wessel considers
the one meter dive to be his best, but potentially he
feels he ‘could be better in the three meter competition.

Bill Brown, faithful alum and former diver at Pitt
years ago, works with Dave about once a week. He con-

McClure Likes Battles

by MIKE MILLER

Gary McClure has a tough
time trying to break into the
starting mat line-up every
week because of the rough
intrasquad competition. but this
is exactly why he wanted to
wrestle at Pitt.

"I liked the top notch guys
I'd have to work with." reports
the 126 pound freshman. "I'll

only ‘get better by wrestling
good guys."
McClure is taking advantage

of a new N.C.A.A. rule permit-
ting freshmen to wrestle in var-
sity competition.

At Waynesburg High School
McClure wasa three time WPIAL
champion and a runner up in
the state competition.

So far this season he has main-
tained a 3-0 record.

He considers John Adams from
Temple his toughest opponent

so far this season. He won an
8-0 decision over Adams.

“I really haven’t wrestled that

FRESHMAN,GARY McCyLURE is currently undefeated for the matmen
in the 126 pound class, where the competition has been extremely keen
as he and fellow frosh Randy Payne have been battling for the starting

siders Dave to have his best shot in the Easterns in the
hree meter event. “The higher you go in elevation, the

t

fewer amount of good divers you find,’ “Dave explained.
“But right now my best is the one meter, by comparison
with the other divers in the country.”

Despite his outstanding performances in the early
eason meets this year, Wessel is by no means satisfied.
“You always feel you can do better,” he continued. “I
don’t feel I’ve come into my own yet. Last year I peaked
too early.”

Wessel also explained that in important part of diving
is psychological. “You have to be confident and feel you
can hit every single dive,” -he went on. “You have to go
into a meet with the right frame of mind. You have to be
mentally up for it.” .

This year Wessel has his eye on the Eastern compe-
ti-tion at Dartmouth in March and his goal is to finish
among the top three divers in the East in both the one
and three meter events. But he noted that the competi-
tion is extremely rugged, especially in the Ivy League.
“The Ivy League is loaded with divers,” he added.
“Princeton and Dartmouth will be especially strong,
they all have somebody good. Princeton is one of the
new upcoming diving powers in the nation.”

This will be the second year for Wessel in the East-
erns and he feels that by simply being a returnee in
the competition his chances will be better. He will be
going into the competition with a full repetoire of dives
‘ and with quite a bit of recognition. 7

Looking even farther ahead, Wessel would also hope
to compete in the nationals this year and perhaps gain
All-America status. To do so, he must place among the
top twelve in the competition. “In swimming, the All-
America status is determined on times, but in diving it’s
« determined on that one day’s performance. You only get
one chance. To do anything nationally, I’ll have to have
a real good day.”

Reminder once again that next Wednesday’s home
basketball game with Temple will be played at the
Civic Arena and campus bus transportation will be pro-
vided. Admission at the Arena will be by ID card. ‘

Layoff As C-MU Fires

Sergeant Bill Sarver’s rifl-
ers got back into action tonight
after a long layoff, hosting Car-
negie-Mellon. But they may wish
that they had another vacation be-
fore the weekend arrives.

The sharpshooters also have a
double match scheduled for Fri-
day against Washington and Jef-
ferson and Clarion State. To-
night's shoot-out starts at 6
p.m. and the twin bill begins at 7
p.m.

Sarver's firers are still leading
the West-Penn League with a 9-1
mark. their only loss coming in
their first encounter with Clarion.

Clarion and Duquesne are des-
parately reaching for the top spot.
each team is in with two losses.

The Pitt riflers’ first win was
over Carnegie-Mellon in the sea-
son opener in September.

‘They (C-MU) have improved

quite considerably since‘ that
time." Bill Crooks. one of the’rifl-
ers. said. "But were going to beat
them.“ «-

“Let me add that we have im-
proved more than them.”

This type of confidence is noth-
ing new for the shooters. They
have seldom gone down to defeat
in the past few seasons. And they
have developed an enormous sense
of confidence under Sarver‘s lead-
ership.

The ROTC Sergeant thought
that the good attitude was lost
about a month ago.

After the loss to Clarion be
blamed the poor showing on per-
sonal “squabbles.” He held a
meeting with the squad after-

things had been resolved.

schedule didn't hurt the situation.

Last year’s campus" champ, the Dents, got off to a shaky
start to defend their crown last week. In a thrilling double over-
time contest, the Table nipped them 44-42, although a protest
due to an officials call will nullify the game if it is necessary at

the end of the season.

. In their second match, the Dents squeezed by the P. E. Club,

52-50. in a very tight game.

The Fiddlers number one team
took possession of first spot in the

Independent "A“ League by edg- ,

ing the Trotters. 46-45. and whip-
ping the Table. 58-39. Despite the
loss touthe Dents. the P. E. Club
looked strong in downing the MBA.
53-45. The Trotters also evened
their record by beating MBA, 64-
46.

In Independent  the Pitt
Pigs won two games. 35-33. over
the Mob. and 40-38 over BMF. The

' Schmidt Brothers kept pace with

them by upending the Experience.
39-37. and knocking off the Law
School Casers. 66-44.

Only one game was played in
“C” League with the Hawks rip-
ping the Pestles, 81'-53. They lead
thatdivision with a 2-0 record.

The Civils got by the Industrials.
38-34. but lost to the Mechs. 29-26.

Other winners were the Fresh.
as they beat the Mets. 59-50. The
Electrics shocked the Petrols. 47-
32. while the Industrials rebound-
ed to whip the Chemies. 49-30.

PiKa looked as strong as last
year, as they humbled AEPi, 84-
40, in the first round of Frater-
nity action. The Fijis ran over Del-
ta Phi, 72-30, and presented
themselves as a strong threat to
PiKa. Triangle edged SAE, 38-28,
in a lower scoring contest.

Sigma Chi demolished Gamma
