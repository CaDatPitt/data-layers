Saturday's derailment of two

evacuation of some Pitt students
from their apartments and left
others concerned for their safety.

A tanker from one of the trains
leaked poisonous phosphorous
oxychloride vapors. Police then

evacuated an estimated 20,000
residents in a six square mile
area.

Some students weren't even
aware of the accident or of the
potentially dangerous situation
that still existed Sunday.

’’I didn’t realize it was as close
as it was, but I'm still not real con-
cerned,” said Laura Montouro.

”I didn’t even hear about it,”
said Gary Holland.

”I have more important things
to worry about,” said Amy Ric-

ci. ”Like finals.”

Some student weren't aware of
. how close the accident was to the
campus. ”I’m not familiar with
the surrounding areas,” said Bob
Love.

The students who did know
were alarmed by the situation.
”We got home from the fraterni-
ty parties, and someone told us
that we might be evacuated, so
we got all nervous. We turned
the TV on and started calling all
the numbers just to make sure.

They told us everything we need-
ed to know, like to close all our
doors and windows and which
streets were being evacuated,”
said April Redmond.

”When I heard that they were
evacuating again, I started to wor-
ry. My initial reaction was won-
dering if people got hurt. I
thought it was a derailment, noth-
ing more, but now it is going to
be in the back of my mind. Ifrn
going to be worrying about it all
day,” said Keith Armstrong.

Train derailment concerns some Pitt students

Some of the north Oakland
fraternities took precautionary
measures. Dave Johnson, presi-
dent of Delta Tau Delta, said he
called the police and was told

that they weren't going to evacu- I

ate. He said that they were keep-
ing their windows closed and
listening to the radio for more in-
formation.

The evacuation was called off»
by Mayor Caliguiri yesterday at

4:15 p.m. He said the clean-up
operation was a success. '

Sabotage
 William Pitt Uniono

By Jim Urban

Editor—in—Chief

William Pitt Union manage- '

ment officials are on the lookout
for an elderly "woman who has
sabotaged five student union toi-
lets in the past two weeks.

The woman, described as a
”bag lady” is white, has gray hair
and is wearing soiled clothes and
gray jogging shoes. She has made
a habit out of clogging toilets in
the main floor and lower level

women's bathrooms.

”She just sits in there, uses up
all the toilet paper and, by ‘the
time she's done, you have to call
the building engineer to get the
toilet fixed,” said Bill Brewster, a

night custodian at the William’

Pitt Union.

”It’s so sickening, that I refuse
to go in there and look at it,” said
Lou McLinden, assistant director
of Student Activities.

Former police chief arrested in drug raid

Pittsburgh — Police arrested 18
people, including a former Indi-
ana County police chief, in a pre-
dawn drug raid through Pitts-
burgh's eastern suburbs, authori-
‘ties said.

Allegheny County Police Su-
perintendent Robert Kroner said
former Saltsburg Police Chief
Russell Clifford, 35, of suburban
Monroeville, was charged Friday
with selling cocaine. He was be-
ing held in lieu of $50,000 bond.

Clifford served as the commu-
nity's police chief until 1980,
when borough officials fired him
for repeated traffic citations. He
pleaded guilty in 1983 to charges
stemming from a series of bur-
glaries and arsons in Saltsburg

and was sentenced twice to five .

years in prison.

The others apprehended Friday .

s were arraigned on charges of sell-

, ing cocaine, heroin, marijuana or

morphine. Most of them were
middle— to high—level dealers,
Kroner said.

Claims growing against
self-styled minister

PHILADELPHIA — More than
$550,000 in stocks and real es-
tate controlled by a self-styled
minister accused of murder and
torture remained frozen Thurs-
day, as claims against the assets
grew.

Common Pleas Judge Samuel
Lehrer continued a temporary
restraining order pending further
court action next Wednesday
over the assets belonging to the
United Church of the Ministers,

‘which Gary Heidnik created in

1975.

Heidnik, 43, is charged with
kidnapping and murdering two
women and kidnapping four
others. All six women were raped
and tortured in a basement dun-
geon at Heidnik’s home, authori-
ties say.

The hearing involved a com-
plaint filed by Lisa Ann Thomas,
18, who says she was held cap-
tive for three months. Police say

they found Thomas and two
other starving women chained in

—Heidnik’s basement on March

24.

Thomas asked the court to pre-
vent Heidnik or the church from
using-the assets for any purpose,
including legal fees. She request-
ed unspecified damages.

Trial slows reopening
of the Dupont Plaza

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico —— The
owners of the Dupont Plaza
Hotel, where a New Year's Eve
fire killed 97 people, hope to re-
open it within a year with the
help of a $6.7 million loan from
the Puerto Rican government.

Miguel Domenech, director of
the government tourism compa-
ny, told the House Finance Com-

mittee on Tuesday that Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Co|on’s ad-
ministration approves of the re-
quest for a loan from the
government development bank.

Meanwhile, federal judge Jose
Antonio Fuste rejected a request
from defense lawyers represent-
ing three hotel employees to
postpone their arson trial on the
grounds that publicity about the
fire would make it impossible to
select an impartial jury.

Hector Escudero Aponte, Ar-
mando Jiminez Rivera and Jose
Francisco Rivera Lopez are
scheduled for trial in federal court
beginning April 27 on charges of
arson. Trial in district court on
charges of first-degree murder, ar-

.son and conspiracy is to begin

May 19.

Domenech said the 20—story
beachfront hotel building is
worth much more than $6.7 mil-
lion and would serve as a guaran-
tee of the loan. The hotel, in the
center of the Condado tourist dis-
trict, was extensively damaged in
the blaze.

Braves earn two runs
thanks to a pigeon

NEW YORK -— A wayward
pigeon flying in short left field at
Shea Stadium helped the Atlanta
Braves score two runs against the
New York Mets on Sunday.

Dion James, leading off the
third inning, lofted what ap-
peared to be a routine fly to left
off Mets’ pitcher Bobby Ojeda.
But as left fielder Kevin McRey-
nolds moved into position to
catch the ball, it struck the pigeon
and landed about 50 feet in front
of him, as James cruised into
second.

The pigeon was killed and
dropped to the ground. Shortstop
Rafael Santana picked up the bird
and handed it to the ball girl.

Two outs later, Dale Murphy
homered to right for two Atlanta
runs.

Bloomfield residents return home after accident

By Marcia Dunn

Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH — About 16,000
residents evacuated from the ci-
ty's East End, because of fumes
leaking from a derailed railroad
car, returned home Sunday after
workers safely removed the
tanker’s deadly chemical cargo.

”Come on back. Come on
home. The area's safe,” Margaret
Rizza, a spokeswoman for the
Pittsburgh Public Safety Depart-
ment, said late Sunday afternoon.

The tanker was among 34 rail-
road cars that toppled off the
tracks when a Conrail freight train
en route to Chicago derailed and
plowed into another freight train
headed in the opposite direction
Saturday afternoon.

No serious injuries had been

reported by Sunday, although 14
people were treated at hospitals
for breathing problems immedi-
ately after the derailment.

People living within 2.6 miles
of the accident were advised to
leave their homes immediately,
but were allowed back six hours
later after the leak was plugged.
They were told to be out of the
area again by noon Sunday,
when emergency crews would
attempt to remove the derailed
tanken

Shortly after midnight,
however, the chemical began
seeping again from the tanker,
and East End residents were
awakened by wailing sirens and
police bullhorns.

By daybreak, about 16,000
people had been evacuated,
many by city buses to aldown-

town convention center where
Red Cross and Salvation Army
volunteers handed out free coffee
and donuts and arranged a Palm
Sunday Mass.

‘'1 want to go back home. But
I'm scared to go back," said An-
toinette Ricci, 43, who spent the
night sitting up with her husband
and two children.

”l’ll never forget this. It was so
frightening,” said Nancy Weag,
33, as she sipped a cup of coffee.

Throughout the evacuated
area, churches were empty on a
rainy Palm Sunday morning and
stacks of newspapers lay uno-
pened in front of newstands. Nor-
mally busy Liberty Avenue was
empty except for police cars and
firetrucks.

The evacuated neighborhoods
quickly came ' back to life,

Passover bitter for Soviet Jews
still trying to leave the country

By John-Thor Dahlburg

Associated Press Writer

MOSCOW .— This year's Pas-
sover will be bitter for some
Soviet Jews, who say the new
Kremlin policies of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev so far have had little
or no effect on their quest to
leave the country.

”There have been very bad
changes during the past year,"
said Vladimir Slepak, a Jewish ra-
dio engineer who has been trying
unsuccessfully for 17 years to ob-
tain an exit visa. ”But on the
o_ther hand, there are now some
signs for hope.”

Since Passover last year, 1,000
Jews have been allowed to leave
the Soviet Union, and some
prominent Jewish activists, in-
cluding Hebrew teacherJosef Be-
gun, have been released from
prison or labor camp.

But Begun and his family re-
main in Moscow, despite their re-
quests to emigrate to Israel.

Begun was freed earlier this
year by a government decree that
pardoned about 150 religious

» and political prisoners. Some

non—Jews in that group, including
dissident psychiatrist Anatoly
Koryagin, have been told they
will soon receive permission to
leave the country, said Begun’s

wife Inna.
”But for the Jews, they have a
special politics,” she said.

New regulations governing the ,

issuance of exit visas went into ef-
fect on Jan. 1. Officials said the

‘ new rules are intended to speed
up the emigration process. But
many ”refuseniks,” the name
given to Jews denied permission
to emigrate, claim the regulations
are more restrictive.

To demonstrate U.S. support
for Soviet Jews, Secretary of State
George P. Shultz will take part in
a Monday night Passover Seder at
the American ambassador’s resi-
dence with Slepak, the Beguns,
Dr. Alexander Lerner and other
prominent refuseniks.

U.S. Air Force jets bringing
Shultz and his party to Moscow
are also carrying kosher wine and
matzo, the unleavened bread
consumed at Passover to mark
the Jews’ desert wanderings after
exodus from Egyptian slavery.

Shultz’ -three-day visit to
Moscow is expected to focus on
arms control issues, but the Unit-
ed States has used meetings with
Kremlin officials to express con-
cern overthe condition of Soviet
Jewry. ~ .

The Israeli government and
Western Jewish groups said as
many as 400,000 of the estimat-
ed two million Jews in the Soviet

Union want to leave the country
tosettle in Israel or the West.
Western reports have recently
quoted officials of U.S. Jewish or-
ganizations as saying they have
agreed with Soviet officials to or-

ganize the emigration this year of

11,000 Soviet Jews.

But Kremlin spokesman Gen-
nady Gerasimov, who accompa-
nied Gorbachev on a visit to
Czechoslavakia, said Thursday in
Prague: ”We didn’t propose to
anybody figures on emigration on
Soviet citizensfof Jewish nation-
ality  as we don't know how
many applications will be sub-
mitted.”

Soviet Jewish emigration
peaked at more than 51,000 in
1979 but has dropped to around
1,000 annually in the past three
years. — - ~

Expressing frustration at being
denied permission to emigrate,

-seven Jewish women gathered

Friday near a Moscow park to de-
mand that their children and
grandchildren be allowed to
leave the country. ‘

”We have no life prospects,”
commented Elena Krasavchik,
one of the protesters.

The women, like Slepak, said
that they have been barred from
leaving the Soviet Union on the

grounds that they or their hus— V

bands knowclassified secrets.

however, as dozens of public
buses returned tired but thankful
residents totheir homes.
Mayor Richard Caliguiri
declared the emergency over
shortly after "4 p.m., after the
phosphorus oxychloride inside
the derailed railroad car was
pumped into two tanker trucks.
The trucks left the area with a
police escort and were believed
to be headed out of state.
”There was a moment of trau-
ma in the beginning. They
couldn't find a pump to get it
started,” said Glenn M. Cannon,
the city's public safety director.

But,  once they got it going,
it went real quick.”

Phosphorus oxychloride, a li-
quid used as an additive in gaso-
line and hydraulic fluid, turns to
vapor in the air and can be lethal
in heavy concentrations, accord-
ing to Cannon. ‘

The other railroad tankers were
hauling a variety of chemicals, in-
cluding toxic toluene di-
isocyanate, a flammable
substance that can irritate the
lungs, skin and eyes when
touched or inhaled.

Another election

might be in order

A violation of election procedures clearly indicates an im-
proper election. The Black Action, Society has admitted that their
elections committee committed infractions in the election of
March 9. Therefore, the BAS admitted that the election was im-
proper. Rather than attempt to rectify the situation, the BAS has
chosen to abide by the results of this election.

The BAS has offered three reasons for its refusal to pursue
a fair election. One of these is simply, "The election was fair.”
The very next clause in the BAS's statement proves that the elec-
tion wasn't fair: "... despite infractions committed by the elec-
tions committee." If the elections committee committed

infractions, then the election was not fair. The explanation con-

tradicts itself. The second reason offered by the BAS is, "The
elections committee was attempting to punish itself. ..."

We fail to see how the pursuit of fair and honest elections
constitutes punishment for any member of any organization.
A fair election would be a’ credit to the elections committee
and the entire BAS. The third reason is that the urgency of time
prohibits re—elections. Even ifthis were true, it wouldn't justify
not holding the elections. The fact is, sufficient time did and
still does exist to hold a re—election. The BAS went so far as
to announce re-elections, only to cancel them. If sufficient time
did not exist, when was the BAS planning to hold the re-
elections that they had announced?

We do not dispute the qualifications of Monique Sims and
Melanie Berg to provide fine leadership to the BAS. It is not
the outcome of the elections that must be questioned, but the
method of election and the motives of those who refuse to pur-

sue a fair and honest procedure.

And hey, let's try to
be careful outthere

We're done. ‘ I

What at times has assumed the state of a runaway truck or
a stampede of cattle is now rumbling to a close. We'are left
now to the task of joining another stampede of which we will
become the leaders. .

It may take time, but the duty will eventually become ours,
and we must assume it with the same confidence and desire
to find the correct answer that has carried us for the past four
years. .

We leave behind the pridelof the basketball team, the frus-
trating struggle of the football team, the pomposity of the bi-
centennial year and a quiet desire to see the university we often
criticized make its way through difficulty and succeed.

On a personal level, we leave behind roommates we both
loved and hated, and apartments and dormitories we often

I despised but still called home. We leave the professors that

made life both more difficult and more exciting than we ever
thought it could be.

I The things we take with us are in great reserves at this univer-
sity. The knowledge we now have can be acquired at no other
place, and it will be acquired by those who follow us. They
will become our competition and will force us to learn even
more.

We are left with but one future task.

, Carry on.

Da da dada, life goes on

I've been acting strange lately
and, for lack of a better reason,
I'm attributing it to the fact that
very shortly I will be graduating.
Some days I feel so relieved and
I think, finally I'll be out of here
and in (pardon the expression)
the real world. Other days I think,
the real world, am I even ready
for it? , ,

Then I take a deep breath and
remember that when I began col-
lege I felt the same way. I was tak-
ing a step away from home
toward being more independent,
and I was a little afraid. I didn't
want to fail.

I have to laugh at some of the
really stupid things I've done over
the past four years. But I can ra-
tionalize them; they're things that
I've learned from.

Like everyone else, I've com-
plained about classes — about
courses_I was either forced to take
because I needed to fulfill a re-
quirement, or because it was the
only open course available that fit
my schedule. I did, though, have
classes that were very interesting.

Outside classes I've. learned
certain things, too; how to survive

KATHY-STAHI.

on a limited budget (eat lunch at
at Sheetz, two dogs for 99 cents,
and for dinner either macaroni ’n'

cheese or oodles of noodles). I've -

learned how to stay up for 28
straight hours, to work on dead-
lines, to deal with people, and
I've learned that there's a heck of
a lot more that I have to learn.

But that's good. That's why
when I think of graduating I know
I'm ready for something new.

I'm still afraid of certain things,
thoughifinding a job, all the
responsibilities, losing some of
the close friends I've made over
the years. I know for myself,
members of The Pitt News have
become like family to me. I hate
growing close ‘to people and
then, that's it.

Think about it. In high school,
you v.ow your senior year that
you'll remain friends for life. One
of my roomates, Pam, will be
moving to New York, and one of
my best friends, Tracey, is mov-

ing to Boston.-

It's funny. When I was little, I
could never understand why
Peter Pan wanted to stay young
forever.

But don't get me wrong. I may
understand it now, but I would
never want it that way. It's a cop
out. It's not dealing with the real-
ity of things.

Anytime a person moves on or
attempts something new in life,
they feel a bit of trepidation. It's
comparable to the feeling my

friend Dirk experienced the first ,

time he attempted ‘skydiving.

I asked Dirk why he did this
when it was so dangerous.

"Well, he said, '’I wanted to do
something different. It was ex-
citing." , '

I asked him if he had been
afraid.

"Not really," he said, "I knew
I had ‘been trained to make the
jump. When I was at the door, I
hesitated. I was a bit nervous
looking down but it was ex-
hilarating knowing that I was go-
ing to do something that not
many peopledo."

Please see Kathy, page 7

G reeks don't want no freaks

I'd like to congratulate Teresa
Candori on receiving the first an-
nual Al G-ampanis Rude Remark
award! Miss Candori certainly
showed her ignorance and her
prejudice towards Greeks with
her remark that Greeks "wouldn't
want any of the pledges getting
hurt driving drunk —- there
wouldn't be anything left to beat
up on." I'd like to inform the mis-
informed Miss Candori that each
fraternity has its own values and
ideas [that] it wishes to instillin
its pledges. These values are not
violence and drunkeness, con-
trary to the ignorant beliefs of
some, but are -values [that] build
character and responsibility.

Miss Candori '[wrote] that
Greeks have put a lot of time and
effort into‘ "changing their im-

LETTERS

age." To that remark, I'd like to
respond that without ignorance
such as hers, Greeks would not
have a bad image to change. Was
it Miss Candori who wrote an ar-
ticle on Greek Week? Did she
even botherto read about our ac-
complishments this year?

The Pitt Greek system does not
revolve around Greek Week;
there are sports, charity fund-
raising and community service
work included in our list of ac-
complishments for the past year.
Creeks form a large percentage of
the membership in many of Pitt's
student organizations, including‘

._.~-

The Pitt News staff. I could go on
and list all of the Greeks’ activi-
ties, but it would take too long,
and I doubt Miss Candori would
care anyway! It is my opinion that
a prejudiced writer cannot fairly
inform the readers of the subject
at hand, so I suggest that Miss
Candori crawl back into her own
little world and leave us Greeks
alone.

I truly believe that going Greek
isn't for everyone, and I respect
anyone’s personal choice on the
matter. Andsince I do respect
people who choose not to be
Greeks, I can only ask the same
respect in return.

THEVPITT NEWS, Monday, April 13, I987

 walkon the wild side

Anyone who knows me knows
that I like to play practical jokes
on people. I like to make a good
joke go a long way.

But in the past four years, I
have realized that when it comes

to jokes, this university has some

good ones, too.
Here they are:
The student judicial system:
I'm sorry, but this is a big joke.
These people act rather official

and serious, and they even act as ‘

though they have a lot of power.
But in a sense, all they do is waste
time. _ ~

They act like they are being
fair, but they're not.

For example, the Residence
Hall Judicial Board can tender a
verdict and decide what punish-
ment is neccessary. But the direc-
tor of the Office of Residence Life
has the right to overrule what the
RHJB decides.

What's the use of having the ju-
dicial board? Why not just let one
person be judge, jury and execu-
tioner?

Perhaps the most ludicrous
thing the judicial board does is
charge students with offenses
committed off campus. Such was
the case with three Pitt students
late last term who were accused
of assaulting another Pitt student
in an apartment building in north
Oakland. .

Guilty or not, this was no place
for the university to stick its nose.
Regardless, it did. The students

Runaway

Let me see if I've gotthis
straight. , ,
Secretary of Statements Geor-

l gie Shultz is headed to Moscow

to bitch at the Soviets about all
the nasty things they were doing
at the American embassy.

Georgie's mad, and under-
standably so. If you had a bunch
of plotting and spy work to do in
a somewhat—less-than-friendly
country, you wouldn't want those
dirty creeps looking over your
shoulder all the time, would you?

There are some other things
they're going to talk about behind
the rhetorical curtain.

Mikey Gorbachev has a nasty
idea. Listen to this: He actually
wants to eliminate the nuclear
arms in the world. .

Can you believe that? What a
slime. I mean, really, why the hell
would we want to get rid of this
mess we've all been worrying
about for the past 40 years or so?
How could anybody be that
stupid? ‘

Obviously, to keep the world
free for democracy, we have to
keep ahuge stockpile of weapons
around capable of.wiping out all
the people whose freedom we're
trying_to protect. We're free, and
we're all created equal, ‘and
we're all free to think what we
want, and if you don't think so,
we're going to kill you. Brilliant.

Anybody could see the logic in
that. I think.

But,,Ronnie and Georgie say
that if we were to give up all the
medium—range weapons pointed
at those lousy Soviets, and they
do a similar thing, then they'll still
have some that can't go as far
pointed at Europe. Except that the
Europeans havelsome of their

were given a slap on the wrist in
the end but, more importantly,
they were caused needless aggra-
vation, and their time — close to
final exams — was wasted.

It's a joke, but no laughing
matter.

Fine arts classes: This is just so
ridiculous.

The primary classes I am talk‘-
ing about are Fine Arts I and Fine
Arts lll. ‘

The main reason these classes
are so. crowded is because they
fulfill a graduation requirement.

But the problem is that these
classes are so ridiculously
difficult that it is not worth the
trouble. The instructors live and
breathe art, and the students are

expected to live and breathe art’

as well. ‘

Unless you are going to teach
this subject later, this stuff is just
not important. It's a joke.

Anyway, those are some of the
things Georgie and the Soviets
are goingto be talking about. I
hope, for the sake of all the rest
of us, that they get their petty
differences worked out, so we
don't have to worry about being
incinerated when those do_ting
fools we call world leaders de-
cide' it's time to have anotherwar.

But, there are some good things
in the news —‘ happy things.

‘Income tax reports are due on
Wednesday. Did you get your
forms all filled out, remembering
to subtract line 15a from line 39g,
but only if the. number from sec-
tion 4 of form Q is less than the
amount on line 235 of form D?
Keep in mind, though, that the
amount declared in section D of
form 58a is to be substituted for
the amount of line 3 if and only
if the weather's nice out.

And, if there happens to be a
mistake on any part of. your
return, it's your fault, even if the
bogus information came from the
IRS itself. _ . , .

Good thing. the whole process
was simplified. this year, I don't

- . know what we'd do otherwise.

The security at Trees Hall and
the field house: I wonder every
time I go up there to play basket-
ball exactly how many of the
people playing are actually Pitt
students and exactly how many

have recently escaped from a

Western Penitentiary Work
Release detail.

The sign says that you must
have a Pitt ID to gain admittance,
but let's face it — you don't have
to have a Pitt ID. ‘

It's so ridiculous that it's funny.

Theta Nu Gamma: I don't even
know how thisstuff got started.
I glanced at this newspaper one
morning, and there was a Theta
Nu Gamma advertisement in it.

It was placed there because we
needed to fill that space at the
end of the evening. There are al-
ways little spaces that need filled
at the end of each deadline night,
so we try to be_creative.

When we found out how para-
noid outside individuals were be-
coming of this new fraternity —
The Pitt News honorary society
— it just snowballed.

A standard appeared at Pitt
football games, and I even now
have a shirt with Greek letters
across the chest.

We didn't mean to offend any-
body. We were just having fun.
It was a joke.

Then, of course, there's the big
box of rockets someone.found
behind a supermarketin Mass-
achusetts.

What?

Yeah, /really. A couple of stock-
boys were digging around behind
their store and found some crates
they didn't recognize. They
opened them up and found a
bunch of fully armed military
rockets. ’

Nobody’s sure who the mis-
siles belong to, the Air Force or
the Army. Everybody, though, is
pretty sure that they don't belong

‘ to the supermarket. They don't

carry that brand anymore. Not
even with double coupons.

Our venerable military estab-
lishment has declined comment,
and that's understandable. They
have to figure out how anyone in
that organization could ‘be so
careless as to allow the Marines
in Moscow to have affairs with
Soviet ladies that led to the trans-
fer of some big secrets.

Then, maybe, after they've

decided how to get some more of

the tax money for themselves,

"and how to build nuclear

weapons that can hit the Soviets
from space, they can try to figure
out what a crate of rockets is do-
ing outside a supermarket in New
England.

I'm sure glad these are the peo-

ple we're trusting to make the de- «

cisions that could kill us all.

And so the news goes for this,
the 13th day of April, 1987.

Glad you could join us.

Read it in the
Sunday papers

Several years ago, I inter-
viewed a woman who had
been raped. It's interesting
how topics in the news go
in and out of fashion; at the
time I interviewed the
woman, the papers were
full of stories about rape.
For some reason, you don't
see that many stories these
days.

I doubt the problem has
decreased. The press seems
to get interested in topics —
one year it might be rape,
the next year it might be
drunken driving — and A ,
then the press moves on. But the problems usually remain.

Recently, I spoke with the woman again. I asked her how her
life had changed. '

"At first, I thought I would never be able to function normal-

ly again," she said. "I couldn't sleep at night. Any time there
was a noise, I would think someone was breaking into my apart-

ment. For a long time, I put a chair against my bedroom door ’

so that I could hear itright away if anyone was trying to get in.
”I never stayed out in the evening. I would go to work, and
then I would go home. As soon as it got dark, I felt vulnerab|e..

Even if I was in a safe situation —'_out with a group of friends

— I was jittery. I wanted to be behind my locked doors."

She said that she gradually got over that. "I thought [that] I
was doing myself emotional damage by shutting myself in like
that," she said. ”And staying locked up at home wasn't mak-
ing me feel secure — like I told you, even in my apartment I
was always wary of noises.

”So I made myself go out. The hardestthing to do was to
get over my distrust of men. I had been friendly with males all
my life, but after that happened to me, I changed. If I. would
see a man looking at me, it would churn me up inside. I would

assume the worst about him.

"It was even that way with men I worked with. These were

men I had known for years. I knew [that] I had nothing to fear
from them. Intellectually, I knew [that] I was irrational to be ’

harboring any distrust of them. -But I couldn't help it. They were
men, and it was a man who had done it to me, and all these
thoughts became jumbled together in my mind."

Although she knew that there were support groups for wom- I

en who had gone through similar traumas, she chose not to take
part in them. V

"I think they're probably great for some women who have
gone through what I went through/’_she said. ”Maybe even
most women.‘ But I just didn't want to talk about it in a group
setting. I've been told that it does you a great deal of good just
to get the emotions out of you. I'm more private than that, I
guess. I chose not to.”

Shedid go to a therapist. '’It was a woman," she said. ”When ’

the time came to make the choice, I knew that I couldn't dis-

cuss this with a male psychologist. So I started seeing this wom- ‘
‘an therapist, and it wasn't as hard for me to talk about it as it

would have been in a group. I think it really helped me;"

She had been dating a man at the time of her rape. "He
_couldn’t have been better about it,” she said. "You hear about —.

men who turn against a woman who has been raped, as if it

were the woman's fault. He wasn't like that at all. He made

it clear that he would help me in any way he could. A
"But it didn't work. It wasn't his fault. It wasn't my ‘fault. I

don't think it was anyone's fault. At the time, I was just in no

emotional shape to have a man in my life. We sort of drifted

apart. We're still friends - he'll call me once in a while — but’

it isn't like it was before."

She has gone out with several men since. "I haven't gone «

to bed with any of them,” she said. "I feel a little embarassed

to admit that. I know [that] I should be over it by now. Itlidn't‘ . . 
tell them the reason for my reluctance. I guess they must have ._ _-  9,,-
just thought I didn't like them.-I couldn't do it. I just couldn't 

do it. I think they thought I was crazy or that there was some-
thing wrong with me." . V V .

She said it angers her that her expereince hasd made her celi-
bate. "I know I can't be that way for the rest of my life," she
said. "I've heard it so many times: Rape is an act of violence,

not of sex. But after it's happened to you, it turns your mind .
about sex. What used to be a pleasurable experience suddenly '4 ti

becomes scary." '
I asked her if she noticed what I had noticed: that the news

: media don't carry as many stories about rape and its effects as. _ . I

they used to. -

"I hadn't thought about it, b_ut I guess you're right," she said. '  I
"The thing is, I never_paid all that much attention to those sto-j__
ries until it happened tome. They were like everything else in

the newspapers; they just filled space."

Down by the schoolyard

It doesn't really matter if you're
going to go home over the sum-
mer or if you're staying at Pitt,

0 there arelstill going to be a lot of

unanswered questions floating
around when you come back in
the fall. ,

The university's bicentennial
celebration will be over soon 
does that mean the money not
spent on paint jobs, expensive
banquets and generally impress-
ing the alumni or outsiders next
year will be offered as student
aid? I hope so.

I would like someone to ex-
plain to me the financial aid situ-
ation. We've been warned that
student aid is probably going to
be cut severely. Is the athletic
department going to reduce the
number of scholarships they offer
in the fall? Or is aid reduction
only for students, not student
athletes?

Should we expect another

you?

Can the football team avenge

can the media stay away from this

I counted 12 cops and two Ger-

I can walk anywhere else in Oak-

That would also explain why I

Pittsburgh's finest have done a

to move the Oakland police sta-

JAMES
CRARY

Before The Who spoiled it
with a mediocre rock opera
about an idiot who just hap-
pened to be deaf, dumb and
blind, pinball was the greatest
victimless sport to be found.
There were really groovy
places to hang out during high
school, like Corner Pocket, to
play machinesinstead of at-
tending class. Too bad some
fool closed that one down.
The William Pitt Union offers
a reasonable collection of
video machines, but pinball is
in rather short supply.

To round off the semester on
something important — Who
keeps choosing those really
heavy topics for me, anyway?
I feel like a philosopher or
something, always writing
about drugs, bombs and
demagogues. Anyway, I final-
ly got my choice of topics and
pinball being like everything
to me, I went into the game
room to appraise their supply
of that particular American
pie.

Again, there are all too few
machines, which makes the
place dull during rush hour
(lunchtime). Nothing is quite
so tedious as standing in line
for pinball. Fortunately, an ex-
cellent man let me slug into
his game, one quarter each.
Cheers to perfect strangers!
But that was on Pinbot.

The first game I played was
Space Shuttle. Space Shuttle is
a good game, not. excellent,
not superb, but probably the

best in the game room. The

return gate opens almost im-
mediately, making up for the

huge gap in the center be-
tween flippers. The machine
stands a good, solid shake and
tilts at about 5.5 on the Richter
scale. The flippers are of aver-
age merit, almost satisfying,
and reliable. The upper targets
are full -of jolts, and although
it is sometimes difficult to see
the objective of the game
(Who reads pinball instruc-
tions?), it is possible to win a
game —- no hidden magnets.

Pinbot, the game I played on
challenge, is not that great,
although my opponent com-
plained only of the flipper and
loves the game. The glare from
the light in the ceiling directly
above the game makes it
almost unplayable. Once you
get it going your way though,
it is terrific fun. The flipper ac-
tion does change the extra ball
position on the side alleys.

Genesis is bunk — by far,
the worst of the lot. To begin
with, it looks stupid. The illus-
trations look like effigies plaga-
rized from The Adams Family.
The upper bumpers have
about as much spunk as a
drunken bureaucrat bemoan-
ing her tax bracket. All paths
on this one point to choke. Just
like white South Africa, ain't
nobody gonna care what be-
comes of this thing once it hits
the garbage heap.

The solution to the situation
is to move Pinbot to the left
and put Genesis under the
glare of that ceiling light. Two
pinball machines of merit are
still not enough, however, to
constitute a vital and active
student existence. Better bring
in Blade Runner, Comet and 8
Ball. .

pinball fanatic, is a showcase

Imagine there's no heaven

I met a man this weekend. Not
so unusual, but this guy was out
of the ordinary. He was a born '
again Christian, which is not so
unusual either, but he was an out-
of-the—ordinary born again
Christian.

He was an attractive man in his
late twenties, the kind you see
singing on the PTL Club — you

. know the type. He was college

educated, and very intelligent. All

3 in all a likeable, warm individual.

I heard something about him
just before I met him, and I'll ad-
mit that it did sway my first im-
pression in an unfavorable
direction.

I'd heard that he ”went to the
Himalayas as a missionary to free
people who were held captive by
Hinduism and Buddhism.” Isn't
that special? A good interprata-~
tion of that statement would be
”he went out intothe world to
shove his narrow views down the
throats of an alien culture.”

Most people who go to India or
Nepal go there for a spiritual
cleansing of sorts. I have this
romantic image of sitting in the
lotus position on the summit of
K2. The Dalai Lama is by my
side. We haven't eaten for days,
and we’re pondering the nature
of the universe. Just then, our
train of thought is shattered by a
Jerry Falwell wanna—be with a
bullhorn. He's speaking in ton-
gues, healing the sick, casting out
demons, and wailing about secu-
lar humanism, all at the same
time. Yet another quest for truth
thwarted by a bible whackin’,
self—rightious bigot.

As I said earlier, that's just
romantic image‘. '

 

 

PAIII. ANATER

The point being, who the hell
is some guy, no matter how in-
telligent, how attractive, how
misguided, to go to another coun-
try and tell them. that the way
they lead their lives and see the
world is wrong?

Who is he to decide that fol-
lowers of Buddhism and Hindu-
ism are trapped? What has he to
offer in exchange for their beliefs
other than a truckload of guilt-
related neuroses?

This guy's parents think he's
the greatest thing to happen to
the world since Jesus, because
he's going out and spreading the
truth to a bunch of pagans.

There's a Hindu temple in
Monroeville. Since the guy who
founded it is spreading what his
parents consider to be the truth,
do they think he's the greatest
thing since Siva? Probably not,

because he's not forcing his be-

liefs on the city and people of
Pittsburgh, he's simply serving
the needs of an existing Hindu
community.

The world has a long history of
the narrow minded trying to

”save the world” with their
respective (non)truths. World-
saving missionaries are the rea-
son Incas are now an extict peo-
ple, why we don't know what the
Stonehenge is, and why Polyne-
sians wear bathing suits. When
one group tries to eliminate all
opposing views, the only people

helped are the eliminators, and I

the rest of the world suffers.

When Christ rolled into town,
he didn’t threaten people with
hellfire. He was tolerant of peo-
ple’s differences, and his message
spread because he appealed to
peoples’ hopes, not because he
preyed on peoples’ fears. I be-
lieve that's called Christian toler-
ance, ‘and it seems to be
something left in the dust by
many in the born again move-
ment.

I may sound a bit narrow mind-
ed in my attack on the narrow
minded. I don't think I am
though. I have nothing against
Christianity, or any other religion
for that matter, as long as it re-
mains in church or at home.

It's difficult to sway someone’s
opinion on many subjects. Every-
body thinks; ”if the rest of the
world only thought like I do, the
world would be a better place,”
myself included. But you can't
sway an opinion on a ‘subject
backed up by nothing but faith.
not only is it difficult, it shouldn't
be done.

So, my fine fundamentalist
friend, let the Nepalese be held
captive by Hinduism, they're
probably happier that way.

DR.
RUTH

Q. Isn't release from tension
what sexual pleasure is all
about? My wife says I become
uncouth and uncontrolled
during the sex act. The con-
trolled kind of sex she thinks
we should have makes a pret-
ty bleak outlook to me.

A. I think that passionate
lovemaking, even if it's a little
bit rough, is desirable for most
couples. Sedateness in the
bedroom so easily leads into
predictibility and boredom
with sex. If every sexual en-
counter brings a wild show,
then we have to doubt the sin-
cerity of it. Sometimes
lovemaking has to be gentle,
low-key. Let your wife know
that variety is needed in the
bedroom and that not every
encounter can fit a pattern.

Handling praisej

Q. I have always had trou-
ble getting and keeping
boyfriends. In fact, /have had
two, but one wouldn't have
sex with me because he actu-
ally was gay, .and the other
wants to but can't seem to do
itfl am 29. My brother says
the reason I don't hook up

with guys is because I don't
know how to take compli-
ments graciously. He says ifl
learned how, my whole life
would change. /5 he nuts?
A. No, not nuts. Something
nice in this country is that
women don't feel they have to
fight off a compliment, say,

. ”Oh, it's just an old thing”

whensomeone says, ”That’s a
nice dress.” Here women can
just say, ”Thank you” to a
compliment like that.

When someone can't accept
a compliment, there are usual-

ly two thoughts in that per-'.

son's mind: ”does he really
mean it?; what does he think
he can gain by telling me
that?; The other thought is ”I
know nothing can come of
meeting this person, nobody is
attracted to me, I don't deserve
any comp|iments.” This reac-
tion springs from the basic
doubts about self-worth and
the trustworthiness of other
people.

I feel sure‘ you would get
something valuable out of see-

ing a therapist — a psychother— '

apist, not a sexual therapist.

Not because I think you are, as, ..
you put it, nuts. Just for some ’

talk about dumping some atti-

tudes that are hard to stumble .

through life with and how to

build other attitudes that can A.
smooth the path before you.

Surgeon fights blacks’ resistance to donate organs

By Marcia Dunn

Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH — Dr. Clive O.
Callender has been sneered at,
jeered at, sworn at and nearly
swung at, all in the name of or-
gan donation and transplantation.

His self-appointed mission is to
persuade blacks to donate their
organs for transplantation.
Perhaps more than any other
group, experts say, blacks are un-
willing to offer their organs to
others and are equally uneasy ac-
cepting strangers’ organs to save
themselves.

His strategy is to chip away at
the religious myths and supersti-
tions that he says account for this
reluctance, along with low trans-
plant awareness and lifelong
medical mistrust.

"Blacks aren't donating. We're
taking, we're not giving back,”
said Callender, one of only a
handful of black transplant sur-

geons in the United States.

"Blacks have more renal [kid-
ney] failure than any other group
because of the high incidence of
high blood pressure,” he said.
"Since we have a unique predi-
lection for high blood pressure
and for kidney failure, then it is
even more important that blacks
should become interested in do-
ing something to help them-
selves.

”We’re a part of the solution
and we're a major part of the
problem because we aren't help-
ing each other.”

Since he began transplanting
kidneys T3 years ago at Howard
University Hospital in Washing-
ton, D.C., the 50-year-old sur-
geon says he has encountered
considerable resistance trying to
persuade blacks to donate loved
ones’ organs.

His greatest obstacles, from the
start, have been "deep-rooted”
beliefs that the body must remain
intact for life after death and that
organ donation is "anti—God."

Opposition has been so fierce
at times that Callender has been
forced to pass up potential organ
donors. Twice last year, he did so
out of concern for the surviving
spouse's safety.

”The brothers and sisters said
[to the wife], ‘There ain't no way
you're going to give our brother's
organs and if you do something’s
going to happen to you,’ " he
recalled.

”Because of the intimidation
and the hostility, we had to allow
that husband's organs to not be
used. We were concerned that
the wife would become a
donon” '

He's also watched countless
blacks languish on dialysis rather
than undergo a kidney transplant.

Nearly 60 percent of dialysis
patients are black in Washington,
D.C., which has the highest inci-
dence of kidney disease _in the
country, according to Callender.
Yet nearly 60 percent of the pa-
tients who receive kidney trans-

plants there are white.

"lt's kind of pitiful that in the
District of Columbia, a
predominantly black area, twice
the number of white patients are
transplanted than blacks," he
said. "For the most part, it's their
[blacks’] choice."

Blacks who do choose trans-
plantation are 10 percent to 20
percent more likely than whites
to experience rejection or other
problems, in part because they
usually must rely on white organs
that don't always provide as close
an antigen match.

"This is a major problem of
catastrophic proportions that in-
volves a population that makes
up close to 15 percent of the
population in the United States,
and we need to do something
about it," Callender said.

The problem isn't a priority for
the largely white transplant
groups, according to Callender.

’’I’m black so I'm concerned
for the black race, and l see them
at the bottom of the list," he said.
”l guess they [white doctors] just
figure somebody's got to be
there."

Dr. Harry Ward, medical direc-

tor of renal transplantation at
Harbor—UCLA Medical Center in
Torrance, Calif, is just as critical

of some of his colleagues, both
black and white. -

All too often, "doctors are
afraid to talk to the family" about
organ donation, said Ward, who
is half black and half Japanese.
"They're afraid they're going to
get their heads blown off."

It's these kinds of misunder-
standings on both sides that have
prompted Callender, Ward and
others to devote more time to
educating blacks about organ do-
nation and educating the medical
profession about minorities’ or-
gan donation fears.

In Washington, D.C., the D.C.
Organ Donor Project, supported

by the National Kidney Founda-

tion, has been working since
1982 with the Bureau of Motor
Vehicles Services in distributing
information about organ dona-
tion to people applying for
driver's licenses. Such prominent
blacks as former U.S. Sen. Ed-
ward Brooke of Massachusetts
and professional basketball play-
er Rick Mahorn appear on posters
promoting the cause, and
Callender addresses‘ groups every
chance he gets and urges families
to discuss the issue.

The result has been a 10-fold
increase in the number of people
signing organ donor cards.

Computers more accessable to

blind students at CMUand Pitt   ’

By Autumn Buckley
For The Pitt News

”/ was left to fend for myself,“
-— Phi//ip Kragnes

A visually disabled student at
Carnegie Mellon University,
Kragnes said he felt that CMU
seriously lacked the kind of serv-
ices he needed when he first
came to the campus in the fall of
1985.

Kragnes set out to change that.

Few, if any, of the students at
CMU realize what an instrumen-
tal role Kragnes has played in aid-
ing the handicapped at CMU.

The Campus Accessibility
Group, a group concerned with
disabled students’ access to all
campus buildings and special
education needs, has been
reformed largely through the ef-
forts of Kragnes. He has been
working since July 1986 on get-
ting a computer center for the
visually impaired at CMU, simi-
lar to the one at Pitt.

”Time constraints are bad for
us,” said Kragnes. At times, he
has waited as long as six months

to receive the recorded versions
of his textbooks. He has access to
student readers, as do Pitt stu-
dents who are blind, but it is a
very time-consuming procedure.
Thanks to computer technology,
students’ time is used more effi-
ciently, and they can be more in—
dependent

Kragnes and Daniel Rossi were
the first blind students ever admit-
ted to CMU, which may explain
why it has taken so long for a
school that specializes in ground-
breaking computer technology to
obtain such needed computer
aids for their blind students.

In spite of a lot of red tape,
Kragnes expects at least one com-
puter center for the visually im-
paired to be available at CMU by
next fall. President Cyert has
OKed his proposal for the
$30,000 computer center, and
there is talk of installing two
centers at CMU.

Pitt has had computer accomo—
dations for the blind since 1984.
The Total Talk II was installed,
along with a Hewlett Packard,
with a modified keyboard and

voice capabilities. An Emboss I
braille printer and an AT&T 6300
personal computer (which also
generates a voice) were 1986 ad-
ditions.

The braille printer is a great ad-
vantage for the visually impaired.
It makes it possible for blind stu-
dents to correct their own com-
puter programs, obtain hard
copies of taped classroom notes
and print test questions in braille.
Before the system was operation-
al, it was necessary for a reader
to read the questions to the blind
student and for the student to
type them out in braille himself.

The voice synthesizers are also
a great help. It can read texts to
the blind students, eliminating
the need for a human reader. This
is especially helpful for people
like Kragnes who cannot read
braille. ‘

The AT&T 6300 is outfitted
with special software that enables
the blind student toxuse software
available to sighted students, ac-
cess the mainframe computers
and storage of information on
disks.

New computer system part of

Pitt's campus of the future

V By Carolyn Wilde

For The Pitt News 

A project team is currently de-
veloping a new computer system
that will mark significant changes
in the way information ' is
gathered and processed at the
University of Pittsburgh.

According to directorjChucl_<

Heins, The _Integrated Student In-_

formation System is expected to
be more on-line, more central-

.ized andmore accessible to the

community than the current sys-
tem, which is especially time-
consuming because data must be

_ keypunched, entered into the sys-

tem, and edited.

The system is broken down
into eight or nine different mod-
ules that will handle registration,
student aid, recruiting and admis-

_ sions, academic histories, hous-

ing, graduation and transcript

. programs,

I “Essentially, it's areal time sys—g '
. tem that collects and retains all

tion and all that kind of informa-
tion about courses throughout the

university. This system will in— ‘

clude the regional campuses so
it includes basically the entire
university and ti-es all the units

‘together/’p said ‘Héins.

These course-inventory and
scheduling modules will update
the registration process and
render the. current system of

4 course cards obsolete.

”The timeliness and accuracy
factors are important,” Heins

said.

According to Henry]. Craig III,
manager of the ISIS project, the
new system will be able to vali-

same‘ time.

“It will provide the Registrar's‘

Office [with] the means of know-

ingi_[the status] of allthe availar“
ble sections of a specfic course,” 3

Craig said.
However, errors are a factor
that must be taken into account

with the current system. Carmen —

said-thatabout 3 percent of the
students registering at the univer-
sity experience errors in their

scheduling that usually occur,

when the registration form is
filled our incorrectly.

’_’In the new system, you'll have
a’ computer terminal where one

Fraternities debate role of little sister organizations

By Laura Montuoro
For The Pitt News

Some love them. Some hate
them. Some have them. Some
don't.

Should fraternities have little
sister programs? Or, are they, as
a Phi Gamma Delta brother who
wished to remain anonymous put
it, ”More trouble than-they are
worth”?

Delta Tau Delta, the largest
fraternity on campus, has ”an ex-
cellent little sister program,” ac-
cording to Connie Moniodes, a
recently initiated Delt little sister.

Jon Axelsson, a brother of Del-
ta Tau Delta said, ”The fraternity
serves, among other functions, as
a social outlet for ladies to meet
and develop long—lasting friend-
ships with men.”

However, Tim ”Spud” Moriar-
ity, a FIJI brother, does not agree.
”Little sisters were an asset at one
time, yet it is a brotherhood. We
do not need little sisters.”

Another FIJI brother, Rick Platt,

said, ”We have no need for little
sisters to do our work for us.”

In response to that comment
Axelsson said, ”Little sisters do
help us out, but it is not a case
of them doing our work for us.
They do only what they want to.”

An inactive little sister who did
not want to be identified said,
”They expect us to do stuff for
them, but when it comes time to
show that we are an important
part of their organization, as they
claim, they refuse to do so."

A Pitt sorority member and
non—little sister said, ”Some little
sisters don't expect any show of
appreciation. They know what
they're getting into when they
pledge. But it must be frustrating
because they are not seen as true
Greeks while they help to sustain
their fraternity.”

Pi Lambda Phi brother John
Falk offered his definition of the
little sister, ”A little sister is a
friend of the fraternity. It is an
honorary title for our friends.”

”The little sisters actively sup-

GETTING TIS WASN’T EASY.

port our fraternity,” Falk said.
”They help out during rush and
help out with Greek Week unoffi-
cially since the university does
not recognize them as Greeks.”

Falk compared the Pi Lambda
Phi little sister program to that of
Delta Tau Delta. ”Our program
is much more informal than the
Delts’. We have no membership
fee. A girl should join a sorority
for a commitment to the Greek
system. We have excellent rela-
tions with our little sisters and
have recently revamped our pro-
gram. Our little sisters do not
seek recognition for any of the
help they give.”

A brother of Delta Sigma Phi,
Hank Compernolle, clarified why
his fraternity has discontinued
their little sister program nation-
ally. ”A little sister who went
through the pledging program
sued the fraternity for the right to
vote in all fraternity elections. She
won the suit, and that is why the
program was abandoned.”

Alpha little sister, Roxannejones,
said that the black fraternities’ lit-
tle sister programs, termed aux-
iliaries, are much more involved
than other fraternities’ programs.

Jones said Alpha Phi Alpha’s
auxiliary gets involved with
”many social service projects.”
Jones said, ’’It is a popular thing

for freshmen girls to do. It is a
good way to meet people and to
make friends.”

Axelsson agreed with this.”A
little sister program allows for an
introduction into the Creek sys-
tem. It is a go—between Greek and
independent. The girls go to Pan-

Cop popular with Pitt
students on the Hill

By George Bellios

For The Pitt News

As he walks his beat, almost
anyone who comes by can be
heard saying, ”Hi, Loyd.” The
familiar sight of Loyd Rodgers
patrolling the hill has become
quite a common sight, and stu-
dents are happy about it.

Officially, Rodgers is the cam-
pus police officer assigned to the
security .of Pennsylvania Hall,
Mineral Industries Building, Falk
School and the fraternity com-
plex. But to the students who live
on the hill and the many others
who visit and attend social func-
tions, he is much more than that.

The students respect and ad-
mire -Rodgers. The consensus is
that Rodgers maintains a friend-
ly but professional attitude
toward his duties, while at the
same time not letting his position
alienate ‘him from the students.

’’I found out that once you gain

_the students’ respect, they not

only look up to you, they have
faith and confidence in your
work. They know that you'll react"
to any situation accordingly,”
said Rodgers.

Tom Shaw of Sigma Chi frater-
nity said, ”During the past three‘
years, not only has Loyd been a

‘great friend, but he has been

there to provide assistance
whenever we needed it.”

Students say that they feel very
comfortable with Rodgers on

duty, especially during the busy

weekends on the hill.

”lt gets pretty crowded up here
on weekends, I'm glad Loydls
here to keep things under con-
trol,” said Jim Sluck of Pi Kappa
fraternity.

’’I’m here to keep the students
in order, and problems to a mini-
mum. This includes keeping all
alcohol indoors during parties
and monitoring all areas for safe-
ty,” said Rodgers.

’’I feel the key to being success— _

ful on this post [post 12], since it
is a. predominantly student en-
vironment, is keeping a profes-
sional relationship without
looking down on the students,”
said Rodgers. ”Each house has its
own personality, but they are
willing to work with me to make
things as pleasant as possible.”

»Rodgers isrnot only respected ’

by the students he comes in con-
tact with, but by fellow officers as

well. Damon Brown,.also a cam—-

pus police officer, said, ’’He’s
great. I feel Loyd is generally"

good with all types of people, ‘I

that's why he's on that post. If

you think he's soft or a pushover,. _
you'll find .out that he can also be .

very tough.”

somewhat of an advantage over
blacks.

”Without question, there is dis-
crimination against the Jews, but
they have a very solid economic
base,” said Eugene Beard, chair-
man for the Labor and Industry
Committee of the NAACP. ”That
is very important.

”And very rarely,” he added,
”are they discriminated against
because of the color of their
skin.”

This has troubled blacks for a
long time, causing animosity.
Perhaps, this has indirectly led to
the split in the Grand Alliance.

Both groups found themselves
trapped in ghettos early in the
20th century. Many Jews escaped
the ghettos; many blacks are still
there. A

The Jews, according to Beard,
were able to advance in society
quicker, and perhaps more easi-
ly, than blacks because they are
white. That led to the early ani-
mosity between the two groups
— animosity that is still present.

”We got away from com-
municating with each other/'.
Beard said. ”The blacks saw the
Jews in their nice homes and all
that, and they realized that some-
times a lot of dollars came out of
our communities, and [the

blacks] were not the beneficiaries

of any of it.”
But many Jews are quick to re-

fute that argument, and perhaps’

they have a valid point. Regard-
less, that is the way the blacks
view the situation, and they prob-
ably will not change, Beard said.

”It’s an '80s problem,” Beard
admitted. ”When you looked at
the '60s and '70s, you found a
very close relationship between
the two groups, and they were
very supportive of each other.

”What happened in the '80s is
that you began to see members
of both communities attack other
members of those communities
verbally, in public. And then you
saw blacks attacking the Jewish
community for things a lot of
blacks thought Jews were doing
in our communities, like taking
dollars out of it.”

Enter Minister Louis Farrakhan,

I the controversial leader of the
[Nation of Islam, an advocate of

separatism between races.

He used to be the warm-up_
speaker forblack leader Rev.-

Jesse Jackson.

The animosity between Jews
and blacks was intensified when
statements made by Jackson and
Farrakhan infuriated the Jewish
community. .

Black journalist Milton Cole-
reported that Jackson
referred to New York City as
”Hymietown.”

That was when Farrakhan
emerged to the American public
withfull force.

He defended Jackson, criti-
cized Coleman, and further an-
tagonized Jews when they began

comparing himto Adolph Hitler.

”The Jews don't like Farrakhan,
so they call me Hitler,” Farrakhan
said». ’_’Wel|, that's a good name.
Hitlerlwas a very great man. He
wasn’t -great for me as a black
man, but he was a great German

man who rises up with strength
a Hitler? What have I done? Who
have I killed?”

Farrakhan became a household
name for many Jews. Many
feared him; an even bigger num-
ber was offended by him.

’’I think there are certain mem-
bers of the black community —
like Louis Farrakhan — who
would like to tear us apart,” Ross
said.

But blacks across America were
not necessarily concerned with
the Jewish perspective of Farra-
khan. In fact, many blacks have
rallied behind Farrakhan.

”When black leaders make a
statement like that — Louis Far-
rakhan and Jesse Jackson — it [in-
furiates] the Jewish community,”
Beard said. ”Of course, blacks
are going to defend their leaders
by saying what they said is true
and going along with that.

’’It got to the point where the
communities got away from talk-
ing to each other. They have not
maintained a good dialogue con-
taining common points as they
did in the '60s and ’70s.”

Black and Jewish defense or-
ganizations have existed since
early in this century. They share
adversaries.

The Antidefamation League,
according to Ross, exists to stop
defamation of the Jewish people
and to secure justice and fair
treatment for all peoples.

Kachinternational, a more rad-
ical group, has evolved from
what was originally called the
Jewish Defense League.

Kach’s area president, Jay
Greenwald, said his organization
is the political arm of Rabbi Me-ir
Kahane, a member of the Israel
Knesset that preaches that Israel
should be rid of Arabs.

Ross said of his Antidefamation

League and the formerJDL: ”We
are the ADL, not to be confused
with the JDL.”

Even more drastic is the Mili-
tant Jewish Defense Organiza-
tion, located at 134 W. 32nd St.
in Manhattan, Room 602.

”That is our mailing address,”
a recording tells you, ”not to be
visited.” ‘

The recording says: ”You have
reached the offices ofthe Militant
Jewish Defense Organization.
We now have karate, gun class-
es, synagogue patrol, as well as
other activities to defend the Jew-
ish community.

”We all see the growing anti-I

— as well as other Jew—hating ac-
tivities across the United States.
isn't it time you started fighting
back? Join us, write to us, contrib-
ute to our cause.

The Jewish Community today
is facing the greatest danger in its
history. Neo—Nazis have won
elections; and Farrakhan is com-
ing back to New York. Isn't it
time that Jews started fighting
back? Remember  ”

The major black defense or-

ganizations, such as the NAACP .

and the Urban League, are some-
what more publicized and less
radical, which makes them
reasonably effective.

”The courts are still a viable op-
tion for us,” Beard said. ”There
are some old civil rights tactics -
picketing, sit—ins, lay-ins, boycot-
ting -- and other sophisticated
ways that we use.” ‘

But despite the differences in
methods and philosophies, all
groups — Jewish or black — list
a common adversary: racism.

”Anything' prejudice or bigotry
oriented, we are interested,” Ross
said. ”We have been involved
with black leaders, as well as the
NAACP and the Urban League,
in fighting for equal treatment for
all citizens.”

 

This would lead you to expect
the two groups to be coming
back together, but blacks contend
that things are not getting better
for them. Things are just getting
worse.

’’I think [blacks] are essentially
in the same boat they have been
in for the past 20 to 40 years,”
Beard said. ’’I think the gains we
made have been eroded through
the courts and through the con-
servative mood of the country.

”Once it was popular to be a
good,_equal—opportunity employ-
er; now it is no longer vogue -
it’s just the complete opposite.
They take a hard line on equal-
opportunity employment.”

The bottom line, it seems, is
that the split in the Grand Alli-
ance may someday become a
gaping hole, should these trends
continue.

Eliminating the split in the
Grand Alliance may be easier
said than done. The black unem-
ployment rate continues to rise,
as the white unemployment rate
goes down.

It gives blacks a reason to be
unhappy about what is happen-
ing to their’ race. At the same
time, they watch many more Jews
continue to prosper financially.

”,lt’s been-kind of stagnant for
the last couple years,” Beard said
of the Jewish-black relationship.

Cholesterol’s role overplayed

By Lee Siegel

Associated Press Writer

LOS ANGELES — Cholesterol’s
role in causing heart disease has
been overstated, as shown by
studies that found no link be-
tween blood cholesterol levels
and the amount of artery block-
age in heart patients, a cardiac
surgeon said.

’’I think it has been exaggerat-
ed; it's been exaggerated as the
cause [of heart disease],” Michael
DeBakey said at a news confer-
ence at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.

He said that while he disagrees
with doctors who ‘believe that the

 

fat-like substance directly causes
heart disease, a high level of
cholesterol in the blood does in-
crease the risk of such illness.
DeBakey’s comments playing
down the significance of cho-
lesterol in causing hardening of
the arteries —— a key cause of heart
attack and stroke — immediately
were criticized by Dr. Claude
Lenfant, director of the National

Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ‘

’’It would be a terrible individu-
al and public health mistake to
underplay the role of cholesterol
in heart disease,” Lenfant said.
”Not everybody agrees with what
he [DeBakey] says.”

Even DeBakey acknowledged
that he still tells patients to ”do

“A

We WELCOME The Addition of

everything they can to control
their cholesterol levels” by fol-

lowing the American Heart As-
'sociation’s

low-fat dietary
recommendations.
But, he added, ”|t’s misleading
to give the impression to patients
that all you have to do [to avoid
heart disease] is watch cholester-
ol” since cigarettes and high
blood pressure also are risk fac-
tors and the ultimate cause of
heart disease is unknown.
DeBakey, chancellor and chair-
man of surgery at Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston, helped
pioneer heart transplantation and
the development of the artificial
heart and performedthe first suc-
cessful carotid endarterectomy-

interests are."

Ross commented, ’’I believe
we have and will continue work-
ing together for the betterment of
democracy.”

One attempt to bring the
groups back together has been to
reach members at an impression-
able age.

Pitt currently offers a class en-
titled Jews and Blacks, co-taught
by Dr. Barbara Burstin and Dr.
Larry Glasco. The class, cross-
listed under History, Black
Studies and Jewish Studies, fo-
cuses on the common problems
faced by the two minorities to-
day, as well as the troubled past
both groups have experienced.

Also, Jewish/black forums have
been conducted by Jewish stu-
dents and members of Pitt's Black

Action Society.

”Each side wanted the other
side to have a clearer understand-
ing of why they hold a particular
opinion on different issues,” said
Betty Pickett, executive director
of the National Conference of
Christians and Jews, the person
who coordinated the forums.

While these programs can do
nothing but help, some think they
could be more effective if stu-

dents would take part in them at-

a younger age.
’’I think it is very important to

reach these kids," said Rabbi Joe
Levine, director of B’nai B’rith
Hillel Foundation in Pittsburgh.
”But it would be best to reach
these kids at the earliest age pos-
sible, during childhood. You
want to let them have exper-
iences together, and the earlier
the better. It should definitely be
earlier than college.

’’If a Jewish kid is [prejudiced] I ».
against a black kid, he did not de- l

velop that prejudice in college.
He developed that prejudice
when he was young, and he has
been carrying that baggage
around all his life.’’ "

Reaching kids at an earlier age
is, however, not a simple task.

’’I’m not aware of any [group
that is] trying to do that,” Pickett
said. ”With just the idea, you are
presented with a real obstacle. It's
difficult to get students out of high
school and get them together.
There are so many time con-
straints.”

So it seems that the two groups
are making efforts aimed at re-
uniting the Grand Alliance,

”And with the continued rise of
the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazi
party,” Beard added, ”you will
see the two communities back
together to fight a common ene-

my, which is essentially racism.”-

Texaco lnc. declares bankruptcy
after $11 billion loss to Pennzoil

By Kiley Armstrong

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — Texaco lnc.,
fighting an $11 billion judgment
in favor of Pennzoil Co., has filed
for protection from its creditors
under the federal bankruptcy law,
its president said Sunday.

Texaco, the nation's third lar-
gest oil company, has been or-
dered to post security equal to the
$8.5 billion jury award to Penn-
zoil plus interest during appeals
of the 1985 ruling. The lawsuit al-
leged Texaco interference in a
planned merger between Penn-
zoil and Getty Oil Co.

”Pennzoil has placed its own
greed above any consideration of
fundamental fairness or the pub-
lic welfare,” James Kinnear, Tex-
aco president and chief executive
officer, said at a Manhattan news

‘conference announcing the

Chapter 11 filing.

”Pennzoil has bludgeoned
Texaco with unreasonable de-
mands,” he added.

Baine Kerr, chairman of Penn-
zoil’s executive committee and
former president of the company,
said he was surprised by the
move.

’’It shows in my judgment an
arrogance and disregard for the
whole judicial process and an at-
tempt to use the bankruptcy laws
improperly,” said Kerr, lead
negotiator for Pennzoil in talks
with Texaco over a compromise
on the security order. '

Kinnear said that major suppli-
ers had refused to deal with Tex-
aco or had demanded cash in
advance, that banks had refused
Texaco credit and that the com-
pany's bonds had fallen.

’.’Pennzoil thought we took
Getty Oil away from them unfair-
ly. We believe we won Getty fair
and square,” said Kinnear, ad-
ding that the bankruptcy action
would allow Texaco to resolve
matters. J

Kinnear called the move ”a
most difficult, painful and
wrenching decision  however,
we had no choice in the matter.”

The Chapter 11 filing will not
affect the network of subsidiaries
”that constitute the vast bulk of
Texaco’s operations,” he said.

Chapter 11 provides a compa-
ny protection from its creditors in
order to reorganize its finances
and continue in business.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme

Court rejected a lower court's rul— -

ing, freeing Texaco from posting
the huge bond, increasing pres-
sure on Texaco to ‘settle with
Pennzoil or to file for bankrupt-
cy court protection.

In 1985, a jury in Houston
found that Texaco unlawfully in-
terfered with a 1984 merger
agreement between Pennzoil and
Getty by trying to buy Getty, and
it awarded Pennzoil$10.5 billion
in damages.

The Texas Court of Appeals in
February cut that by $2 billion,
but with interest Texaco now
owes about $11 billion and is re-
quired by Texas law to post a
bond in that amount pending its
appeal
. In January, U.S. Districtludge
Charles Brieant, in White Plains,
N.Y., agreed with Texacb’s claim
that posting the bond, then $12
billion, could bankrupt the com-
pany, thus denying it its constitu-
tional right to appeal the verdict.

Brieant said Texaco need post

only a $1 billion bond, and an
appeals court upheld his ruling.
But the U.S. Supreme Court on
April 6 said Brieant was wrong to
have heard the case before it first
had been fully aired in the Texas
courts.

Texaco responded that it would
appeal the Texas bonding law in
the Texas courts promptly and,
on Friday, it filed papers with the
Texas Court of Appeals saying
that it could not afford to post the
full security without seeking
bankruptcy protection. The court

scheduled a hearing for 9 am.

Monday.

Kerr said Texaco had never
made a substantial offer to Penn-
zoil during the negotiations.

”They talked a lot about mak-
ing a settlement offer, but the fact
is that they have never offered
anything substantial or anything
close to what we or anybody else
would have expected or thought
to be appropriate.”

Pennzoil . made "a counter-
proposal to Texaco’s board that
was ”well within” the range that
financial analysts following the

. case said Texaco could handle,

Kerr said.

”Their response was filing for
bankruptcy,” he said.

Texaco, the nation's eighth-
largest industrial company, was
founded in 1902 as the Texas
Co., following the discovery of
oil the year before at Spindletop,
near Beaumont, Texas.

It has 55,000 employees and
had after-tax profits in 1986 of
$725 million on $32.6 billion in
revenues. Among oil_ companies,
only the Exxon Corp. and Mobil
Corp. are larger. ,

Philadelphia surgeon claims
third trimester abortion legal

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — An at-
torney for a _Wynnewood doctor
accused of violating the state's
abortion law said he plans to ap-
peal a court ruling that backs the
law as constitutional.

Common Pleas Court Judge Al-
bert Sabo denied a motion. Friday
to quash charges of infanticide
and aborting a viable fetus against
Dr. Joseph L. Melnick.

The ruling upheld the constitu-
tionality of the law by allowing
charges against Melnick, who is
accused of performing an abor-
tion on a teen-ager who was eight

months pregnant.

Defense attorney Richard A.
Sprague said he would appeal.
He claimed two sections of the
law were unconstitutional, in

part, because terms such as-

”abortion” and ’’born alive’’ are
too broadly defined.

Melnick is the first physician to
be criminally charged in Pennsyl-
vania with violating the abortion
law. Charges of murderrand in-

voluntary manslaughter were dis-

missed following a preliminary
hearing.

cused of performing an abortion
on the 13-year-old at West Park
Hospital in Philadelphia Sept. 12,
1984.

The prosecution contends Mel-
nick made no effort to savejthe
life of the 3-pound, 9-ounce girl
who allegedly survived several
hours after the procedure.

Assistant District Attorney John
DiDonato said Melnick knew or
should have known the fetus was
developed enough to live outside

"the womb. '

Sprague had tried to remove
Sabo from the case because the
judge is a Roman Catholic and a

member of a war veterans post _
that supports the Roman Cathol- ,

ic church, which has condemned
abortions.

Sabo refused to withdraw from
the case. He insisted he followed
the ’’law of the state" in the cour-
troom, not ”the law of the
church.” _ '

Sprague then charged Sabo
with favoring the prosecution in
criminal cases and said he want-
ed to hire criminal lawyers to
back up his claim.'The judge de-
nied the allegation and turned
down the attorney's request for a
hearing.

A CHALLENGE TO
THE GREEKS

When I was asked to write an ar-

ticle for the Greek Olympia, I hes-
titated due to the fact that I
couldn't decide on an exact topic.
There are too many from which to
choose. However, I have decided
to write a message to each of you
as fraternity and sorority members
in the hope that I will inspire you
to think about your committment
to the Greek system.
When each of you pledged or as-
sociated with your chapter, you
made a promise —— not only to your
chapter, but to the Greek commu-
nity. That promise is to uphold
the integrity and ideals of your in-
dividual fraternity or sorority. In
doing so you allow the entire
Greek system to beneﬁt. My
challenge to each of you is to
remember these concepts and
practice them. We all know that
they only get dusty staying closed
up in a ritual book. Speciﬁcally,
use the Greek ideals such as uni-
ty, trust, and cooperation to en-
hance the Greek system in areas
such as the following:

Membership
Promote the Greek system as a

recruitment-

whole. Honesty about your own

chapter, the responsibilities of ’

memberships and the beneﬁts of
Greek life will only enhance in-
terest in the ‘Greek system. Brag
about your chapter,‘ but also in-
form rushees about the system as
a whole. If your chapter is work-
ing to its potential and striving to
be its best, prospective members
will want to be a part of it. Also,
if your chapter is no longer rush-
ing because you’ve reached your
maximum size, start rushing for
the other chapters. Make sure that
unaffiliated students know about
the opportunities in the fraterni-
ties and sororities at Pitt. The
Greek system has grown approxi-
ately 10 percent each year over the
past four years. Let's keep up the
momentum.
Personal Development-
Remember what you can receive
from fraternity and sorority mem-
bership. As freshmen the chapter
should ideally help you become

' familiar with the university and its

resources. Greeks are involved in
every aspect of student activities
and programming at Pitt. Keep

V generating that interest. Those of

you that are upperclassmen have
the obligation to train and prepare
the younger leaders of your chap-

ters. There are few organizations
that provide the variety of leader-
ship experiences that are offered in
fraternities and sororities. Take ad-
vantage of what you can receive
from your membership and you
will beneﬁt as an individual and
the community will beneﬁt from
your growth and knowledge.
Service-Put what you have
gained from your fraternal ex-
perience and put it back into the
community. The long hours you

often spend in preparation for’

dance marathons, phone-a-thons,
canning, and service hours are well
worth your time and energy. By
doing these type of activities, you
are your own best public relations
tools. The feeling of accomplish-
ments you receive will be your re-
ward for your hard work and
dedication.

In closing, I commend you on
the accomplishments the Greeks
have made this year—coping with
dry rush, breaking another Greek
Week charity record, successfully
completing many service projects, '
and striving to do your best. Ac-
cept the challenge to reach out
even more and the entire Greek
system and university will benefit
from your committment.

BRIDGET GUERNSEY

MORE THAN JUST...

Greeks on college campuses are continu- '

ally misrepresented as irresponsible
“Animal Houser’s' ', who only have a good
time at the expense of others. In reality, the
men and women involved in fraternities
and sororities have a lot of fu_n whil help-
ing others. In the past year, Pitt Greeks
have been spending hours of their time for
both local and national charities. The fol-
lowing is a sampling of their efforts.

The national philanthropy of Alpha Del-
ta Pi is the Ronald McDonald house. Chap-
ters across the nation held a fundraiser
called “Save a dime a day for 100 days"
in an effort to fund the opening of the
100th Ronald McDonald House.

The sisters of Delta Delta Delta were also
active. In addition to working for their na-
tional charity and the Greek Week chari-
ty, they also made decorations for the
children at Children's Hospital at Hal-
loween, and caroled for the Negley House
at Christmas. .

Fraternity men were, of course, no less
active this _\ear. The brothers of Delta Tua
Delta collected more than 200 pints of
blood, and raised over $21,000 for the Har-
marville Rehabilitation Institute. In addi-
tion, they participated in the Parents for
Pitt Phonathon, which raised money for
scholarships, library equipment, and other
goods and services offered by Pitt.

The sisters of Kappa Delta sorority were
also active with Children's Hospital. They
raised over $1700 for Multiple Sclerosis by
sponsoring a Haunted House in October.
Their major effort, however. came on St.
Patrick's Day, when theyhad a balloon
release.to benefit the prevention of child
abuse. More than $200 was raised for Bright
Beginnings, a local child abuse prevention
center. Their green and white balloons
could be found as far away as Charlesburg,
W.V.!

The sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma
helped Phi Kappa Phi brothers with their na-
tional charity - Play Units for the Servely
Handicapped. Together, over $2,500 was
raised. The Kappas are also involved with
Metal for Miracles, by donating their time
to help the handicapped.

In October, the brothers of Lambda Chi
Alpha helped Phipps Conservatory to raise
over $19,000‘ through the Fright Night
Haunted House. They helped the College
of Arts and Sciences by raising one-ﬁfth of
the $50,000 it raised to support the Univer-
sity by phonathons. ' In addition, the
brothers responded to violence in Oakland
by organizing Pitt's ﬁrst and only student
escort service.

By now you are probably tired of read-
ing, but we are not even close to ﬁnished!
The brothers of Pi Kappa Alpha held their
annual Volleybash to raise money for the
United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Pitts-
burgh. They also participated in the Hand-
in-Hand Festival, and helped a Lift-a-Thon
for Cystic Fibrosis. They participate in a
Neighborhood Watch program, to “make
their little corner of the world safer for
everybody". .

The Pittsburgh Chapter of Sigma Alpha
Mu participated actively in its national char-
ity, the American Heart Association. They
helped raise over $4,200 at Pitt, and over
one million dollars nationwide. They have
also sold tickets to Pirate Games, not for
proﬁt, but to benefit the Pirates and the
community.

Sigma Chi netted $2,500 for the rehabili-
tation institute of Pittsburgh with their Der-
by Days Fund-raiser. The event is organized
around sorority competition with the overall
winner being crowned at week's end.

The sisters of Sigma Delta Tau held an
M&M-athon this year, which they hope to
make and annual event. This raised money
for the prevention of child abuse, their na-
tional philanthropy.

In addition to work for their national
philanthropy, the Calenmany Home Mis-
sions, the sisters of Theta Phi Alpha helped
various Pittsburgh groups. They, collected
cans for the Pittsburgh Food Bank, partic-
ipated in the Hand-in-hand Festival, and
helped to raise money for Harmarville.

Through a close relationship with i

the ofﬁce of Student Activities Pitt
Greeks have made great strides to
improve their standing at the
University and within the Com-
munity.

Internally Pitt Greeks have
beneﬁtted from our President's
Conference; held annually to im-
prove leadership skills while also im-
proving fraternity / sorority

‘relationships. Through these im-

proved relations Pitt Greeks are able
to unite to Aid the University's Par-
ents for Pitt program, and the Bicen-
tennial Commision.

Within the community Pitt
Greeks have proven to be an invalu-
able asset. This year’s Greek week
truly proved to be the “Year it all
Happened,” raising over $72,000
for Harmerville Rehabilitation.
Aside from Greek Week Pitts Greeks
have served the community in
numerous ways. Through participa-
tion in Central Blood Bank's H.I.P.
program Pitt Greeks have collected
over 400 pledges to donate. blood.
Along with the H.I.P. program
Greeks have done their best for
Hunger Action Coalition, the
Brashear Association, and the
American Heart Association.

GREEK  

For the ﬁrst time ever the I.F.C.
held an Awards Banquet with Pan-

hellenic’s to follow next year. The .

highlight of the evening was presen-
tation of awards for sports and chap-
ter operations, includingAcademic
programing, pledge / Assoc.
programing, and Alumni programs.
Attendance at the event was very_im-
pressive and next years events
promise to be bigger and better.
As the leaders of the Greek com-
munity we see the Pitt Greeks con-
tinuing to improve through
increased participation within the
University and the Community. Im-
provement will be accomplished
through improved programing and
better understanding of our diverse
publics.

Besides philanthropy, Pitt’s
Greeks are also known for their
unique and innovative social
programming ‘and individual
chapter achievement.

The following is a brief synop-

sis of exceptional achievement on
the part of individual chapters:

Alpha Delta Pi

Alpha Delta Pi is proud of our
achievements in Greek Week. We
received the most improved
sorority award, and got 4th place
overall. .

We're also proud of our two

candidates who are up for Pi Kap ,

Rose Queen. They are Jill Graner
and JudyKozel. The Queen will
be announced Friday night.

i Our Sorority had 3 members in- -

itiated into Rho Lambda, the
Greek Women’s Honorary Socie-
ty. Theyiare Kim Gerber, Suzie
Sawyer, and Jackie Solomon.

Our National Convention is be-
ing held in Scotsdale, Arizona on
June 21-25. All National awards
will be awarded there.

ALPHA EPSILON PHI

This year has been a fantastic one _

for us. We greatly increased the size
of our house and continue on our way
up. We competed very strongly in

 

 

Brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi helps SDT preveB*c

Greek Week and placed 1st in Spirit,
1st in Fun and Games, 2nd in Chari-
ot, 2nd in Dance Marathon and 2nd
in Charity with over $75 per sister.

We are also very excited because this
summer we are the hosting chapter for
our National Convention.

DELTA PHI
This year Delta Phi took great strides to expand.
and possibly lose its “small fraternity" image.‘ Next

fall, for the ﬁrst time in four years, we will be mov- ‘

third house sirtce our appearance on the Pitt Cam-
pus in 1967.

Despite our small brotherhood‘ of fourteen, we
decided not to implement a “no pledging” plan as
others have in order to promote quality instead of
quantity.

Next fall we are planning a hockey tournament and

again they were commended for be-
ing one of the strongest chapters in the
nation.

The success of the chapter can be
contributed to many factors, but the
most inﬂuential factor is the individual

The 1987-88 School year was a
busy and rewarding one for the sisters
of Delta Zeta.

We started off with a very success-
ful rush in which we took 16 fantastic
pledges and hit ceiling.

November started out with Pennsyl-
vania Province Day. Our chapter won
awards for rush excellence, reaching
ceiling, Philanthropy, Standards,
Sorority Education, Scholarship and,
for the second time in two years,

‘ ‘Pride of the Province, ” the award for
outstanding chapter.

We started out second semester with L

a winter formal, election of a new ex-
ecutive board and the initiation of our
fall pledges. For the second semester
in a row, we hit ceiling.

In April we held a senior ceremony
to say good-bye to our graduating sis-
.ters, and several workshops to prepare
for another successful rush this fall.

"KAPPA DELTA

Kappa Delta is proud of its great
year at Pitt. Our major achievement
for the year was an increase in mem-
bership. By more than doubling our
size, we opened a door of great poten-
tials for our chapter. '

Kappa Delta Sisters are also in-
volved in a great number of student
organizations on campus, Xi Chapter
of Kappa Delta represents a group of
well-rounded college women.

National Kappa.Delta is holding its
viennial convention July 2-7 in New
Orleans. With Xi Chapter’s marked
improvement, we have a great chance
at winning a number of awards.

Kappa‘s focus this year was on internal

i growth. Not only have we acheived our goal

to reach ceiling but have also done outstand-
ing scholastically, Vacheiving top sorority

SIGMA DELTA TAU

We’ve had many social activities this
year including mixers and holiday par-
ties. This year our chapter staged an

 

impromptu party which promoted
nonalcoholic drinks. Our informal in
November was on the Gateway Clip-
per. Our Formal weekend was fantas-
tic this year. It included a party in the
suite Friday night and the Formal at
the Lemont Saturday night.

We had a total of 17 pledges this
year which doubled the sizeof our
chapter. We are a strong chapter and
to be even stronger after formal rush
comes around!!!

SIGMA SIGMA SIGMA

This year makes the tenth an-
niversary of Sigma Sigma Sigma
sorority’s return to the University
of Pittsburgh. It has been an
eventful year for us. We have done
many things which we feel we can
be proud of.

We have traditionally been very
active in our national philanthro-
py, the Robbie Page Memorial
Fund. Our motto is “Sigma serves
children”. We have done this
through taking Children's Hospi-
tal patients trick-or-treating
throughout the hospital units on
Halloween and by sponsoring" a
booth at the Hand—in-Hand
Festival.

We took and active interest in
Greek Week this year, and our ef-

forts were rewarded with a second ’

place Blood Drive trophy and a se-
cond place finish in Fun and
Games.

Our sisters‘ are becoming in-
creasingly involved in activities
outside of our chapter. Many of
our sisters are members of DARE
(‘Drug and Alcohol Responsible
Education). In addition, Vice
President Melissa Fornal was just
initiated into Rho Lambda. Presi-
dent jodie Fine was recently in-
itiated into both Omicron Delta
Kappa and Mortar Board honor so-
cieties and was named Rho Chi

, Co-chairperson for this year.

—Our national organization has

 

developed a strong interest in our
chapter. In the past year, we have
had the privilege of hosting visits
by a national ﬁeld representative
and our National Collegiate Chair-
person. Both were very impressed
with the strength and the unity of
our chapter.

TI-IETA PHI ALPHA

This past year Theta Phi Alpha
celebrated at their Diamond
jubilee Convention in Dearborn,
Michigan. This convention was
very special for our chapter because
we brought back four National
awards including the Ocilia Leuch-
weis award for “Most Improved
Chapter”, the Gloria Neises award
for the Best Board of Directors and
the first National Song award for
best original song. Our involve-
ment with National continued
throughout the year with visits
from many of our National
ofﬁcers. The major theme for this
year was the celebration of our
sixty-ﬁve years at Pitt. We held a

special reception before our"

Founders’ Day to mark the oc-
cassion.

Little sisters cause friction be-

NEWARK, N.J. — The works of
composer Antonio Salieri, whose
fame was eclipsed by the genius
of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
are enjoying a revival thanks to
a college professor and, of
course, Mozart.

Salieri, whose rivalry with
Mozart was dramatized in the
1984 film Amadeus, was featured
in weekend concerts that includ-
ed the first public performance of
one of his major works since his
lifetime.

Musicologist Jane Schatkin
Hettrick, who has been studying
Salieri’s work since the 19605,
came across the 182-year-old
manuscript for the ”Mass in B
Flat” in Salieri’s own hand at a
Vienna library in 1983.

She made a copy of the work,
which she described as ”unjust-
ly neglected,” and she tran-
scribed it into modern musical
notation.

The Mass, believed to have
been last heard publicly in 1822,
was performed along with a 1773
Salieri organ concerto at Rider
College in Lawrenceville, where
Hettrick is an associate professor
of music.

The program included a work
by Beethoven, who studied un-
der Salieri —- but not Mozart.

Salieri ”was a composer of
tremeﬁdous importance in his
day,” Hettrick said.- To modern
audiences he is best known as
portrayed by F. Murray Abraham
in the 1984 film version of Peter
Shaffer’s -play Amadeus.

Abraham, who sent a video-
taped presentation that was
shown at the performances Friday
and Saturday, won an Oscar for
best actor for the role, and the
film was voted picture of the year.

”It certainly gave Salieri a
boost,” Hettrick said. ”As in the
1780s, in the 19805, everyone’s
heard of him.”

Salieri, born in 1750 near Ve-
rona, Italy, was court composer

‘THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 13, 1987

in Vienna from 1778 until a year
before his death in 1825. Wolf-
gang Amadeus Mozart also
worked in the court for a few
years before his death in 1791 at
age 35.

In the film, Salieri, madly
jealous of Mozart's genius and
popularity, sets out to destroy the
younger composer. Hettrick said
the story "takes considerable
license with history, but [is] based
on a framework of truth.”

”The legend of Mozart and
Salieri has that Salieri poisoned
Mozart,” Hettrick said. ”If he
didn't actually murder Mozart, he
is said to have poisoned his life
suppressing performances of his
music.

”At the very least, Salieri was
likely terribly conscious of his
own» inferiority or mediocrity in
the face of the incredible genius
of Mozart,” she said.

As to history's niche for Salieri,
Hettrick said he ”falls somewhere
between the catergories of a good

4

composer and a great com-
poser.” He is a minor master,
while Mozart ranks as a major
master.

The Salieri organ concerto was
unearthed and given its first
modern performance on Friday
and Saturday, with Hettrick as
soloist.

She said she found the
manuscript in a Vienna archive
while studying organ under a Ful-
bright scholarship in the late
1960s. She first performed it in
1971. ”It is not correct to say I
discovered these compositions,”
Hettrick stressed in a telephone
interview. ”The manuscripts
were in libraries. I merely
brought them to light.”

To mark the first modern per-
formance of the Mass,the Austri-
an government sent the original
manuscripts of both it and the or-
gan concerto to the college for
display.

Additionally, an Austrian com-
pany plans to publish Hettrick’s
edition of the Mass, she said.

U.S. prepares to respond to
Gorbachev’s arms proposals

By Barry Schweid

Associated Press Writer

HELSINKI, Finland — Secretary
of State George P. Shultz met
with a dozen U.S. arms control
advisers Sunday to ready his
response to new Soviet overtures
that might bringithe Reagan ad-
ministration closer to its first arms
control agreement.

Limited by President Reagan in
other nuclear areas, Shultz hopes
to clear a major obstacle to a
treaty to rid Europe of medium-
range missiles in talks opening
Monday in Moscow.

The barrier is the presence in
East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and the Soviet Union of 130
shorter-range rockets that the
United States and its North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization allies
want the right to match.

In two speeches, Soviet leader
M.ikhail.S. Gorbachev offered to
negotiate a solution while the
two sides complete an agreement
to eliminate their other medium-
range missiles from Europe.

"I think it's some degree of
movement, it's somewhat differ-
ent,” said a senior U.S. official,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ”But we certainly ha-
ven't achieved closure. There is

’ a lot of work to be done.”

Shultz is unlikely to give the

 

LeRoy Clark
David Maier

Soviets a final answer when he
sees Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, beginning on
Monday, and General Secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, probably
on Tuesday.

”We propose to seriously dis-
cuss this, try to work out an
agreement,” the official said.

But he stressed the Soviet edge
in the 350- to 600—mile range
missiles was a serious issue to the
West European allies and they
must be consulted on the kind of
cuts the United States would
demand.

”After all, this a matter of great
importance to our allies,” the offi-
cial said. .

Of all the nuclear arms control

_issues under negotiations, an

agreement to rid Europe of
hundreds ‘of missiles in the 600-
to 3,000-mile range. is the closest

. to completion.

It would be the first treatyto put
a dent in the superpowers’
nuclear weapons buildupsin the
more than six years Reagan has
been president. A

In lengthy negotiations, the two
sides decided basically to dis-
mantle all but 100 warheads
each. But the Reagan administra-

tion first wants the right to match’

the 130 shorter—range Soviet
rockets. _ _ _
The West Germans have 71

comparable missiles. The United

States has none in Europe, but
would like to convert some of the
108 Pershing 2 missiles now in
West Germany to ’a shorter range
weapon.

The senior official said if the
Soviets recognize a U.S." right to
match their total equal ceilings
could be set below 130. But, he
said, ”it was not certain, by any
means” that the allies would ac-
cept a total ban. .

Shultz’ talks in Moscow are
bound to be clouded by U.S. al-
legations that the Soviets, with
the collusion .of some American
Marine guards, infiltrated the U.S.
embassy with eavesdropping
devices.

Shultz said Saturday he would
confront the Soviets about ”the
severe hostile environment‘ they
set up.” He‘ said he and Reagan
were ”very upset about what has
happened.” '

But Shultz has also vowed to
pursue agreements with the‘
Soviets on Euromissiles and on a

' . troop withdrawal in Afghanistan.

”We are pressing them to get
out,”'a second U.S. official, also
demanding anonymity, said Sun-
day. ”Tomorrow would be fine.”

About 115,000 Soviet troops
are in Afghanistan, supporting a

strongly pro-Moscow govern— 
J merit in its civil war with Islamic

guerrillas. The Red Army entered
the country in 1979.

rookie record with 50 stolen
bases-last season. But as far as
Pittsburgh Manager Jim Leyland
is concerned, that's nothing com-
pared to the steal that Pirates

Jim Morrison homered and

drove in three runs and Cangelo-

si, making his first Pittsburgh start, ‘

went 4-for-4, scored three runs
and drove in another as the
Pirates defeated the St. Louis

’’I’m sure Syd is feeling pretty
good today,” Leyland said, refer-
ring to last month's trade in
which the Pirates sent pitcher Jim
Winn to the Chicago White Sox
for Cangelosi. '

Winn didn't fit into the Pirates’

plans, and now Leyland must try
to fit Cangelosi into his outfield.

”Last_ year we had a different
lineup every day, and I want to
stay away from that as much as
I can. Barry Bonds will be back

A surprising choice

on this All-

It's been a long, successful year
for the majority of the Pitt sports
teams. Whilethe football team
didn't have the kind of success
fans wanted, the Panther basket-.
ball team had a great year.

The men's and women's swim
teams once again won the Big
East championships, although no
one really noticed or cared.

But rather than go through each
team and its accomplishments (or
lack thereof) I will name my All-
Enright team, which is comprised
of the five most versatile and in-
teresting athletes at the universi-
ty this year. Keep in mind this
isn't a team comprised of the five
best athletes, but «five guys I'd
love to have on my team no mat-
ter what sport. Sort of like the All-
Madden team.

Jerome Lane, sophomore for-
ward, basketball team — What
can you say? The guy had an in-
credible year. Lane had the best
season a Panther basketball play-
er has had since the early '70s
when Billy Knight roamed Fitz-
gerald Field House.

But it wasn't just Rome's play
on the hardwoods that made him
such a hero on the Pitt campus.
Often Lane's off-the-court antics
caught people's attention just as
much as one of his powerful re-
bounds.- ,'

Lane, whose middle name is
lazy, made a habit of ‘saying
things that upset opponents, such
as when he called Robert Morris
a ”rinky dink” team.

This guy definitely has a way
with words. After Pitt beat Con-

necticut in February, Lane told a '

“reporter, ’’I don't care if we're
playing Our Lady of the Scam; I

West.

”You . can't look for’ doing
everything like back home," said
the 6-8 Liberty, who averaged 28
points at Martin Luther King High
School. ”There’s too much talent
on the floor.” ’ '

Shorter, a 6-7, 220-pound for-
ward from Mouth of Wilson, Va.,
scored 10 points to lead an 18-6

East spurt to open an 84-58 lead

with 15:53 left in the game.

Our Lady of the what? And to

think Rome will roam the Pitt

campus for two more years (prob-

ably). *It should be a lotof fun. '
8 Craig ”|ronhead” Heyward}

against Miami on national te|evi—L.
sion last November was one of‘-

the best ever by a Pitt back.
If Heyward continues to stay
out of trouble off the field --

watch out. No one will be able‘

to stop him the next two seasons.

- JOHN
ENRIGHT

Plus, you have to love a guy
who says he doesn't really work
out with weights, and that it's ”all
natural strength.” Keep eating
those '0’ dogs lronman.

Lee McRae, junior, sprinter,
track team —— McRae’s exploits on
the track often go unnoticed by
most. It's a shame that track isn't
a more popular spectator sport.

As great an athlete as Lane is, he,

has nothing on this guy.

You know McRae’s good when
he's almost a sure bet already for
the 1988 Summer Olympics in

Seoul, Korea. If he can only bring ;
home the gold, he'll go down as - 

maybe, just maybe, the greatest
athlete ever to attend the univer-
sity. This thought used to be
scary, but it no longeris.
Nothing in McRae’s personali-
ty strikesme, but you can't leave
an athlete like this off of any All-

PITTSBURGH — At the start of
the 1986 season, the Pittsburgh
Pirates didn't have a bullpen by
committee as much as they had
a bullpen by default.

Then-rookie Manager Jim Ley-
land had designated the hard-
throwingJim Winn as his bullpen
stopper, but Winn didn't spend
much time in that role after bat-
ters began timing his fastball. Lar-
ry McWilliams, Jose DeLeon and
Cecilio Guante all tried to fill the
short-relief role but with little suc-
cess, until Don Robinson won
the job at mid—season.

Leyland doesn't plan much
tinkering this season.

Robinson, who had 14 saves in
15 opportunities last season, will
usually be the last man out of the

bullpen. If he isn't, it will be right-

hander Brian Fisher, who was ob-

tained from the New York
Yankees in the Rick Rhoden deal.

Barry Jones, John Smiley and
Logan Easley will be the middle-
innings reliever, with the veteran
Bob Walk serving as the long
man and occasional spot starter.

Leyland said the inability to
find a reliever who could close
out games was one of the main

reasons why the Pirates finished‘

44 games out of first place and
endured their third consecutive
last-place finish in the National
League East.

”We’re not going to keep.

searching and searching like we
did last year; we're going to go
to Brian Fisher and Don Robin-
son late,” Leyland said. ”We’re
going to go to Robby late because
he showed me last year he can do
the job. I think he was comforta-
ble in the role, and he did well
in it.”

Villanova
takes Pitt

The Pitt baseball team
traveled to Philadelphia this
past weekend to take on the
Villanova Wildcats in a three-
game set but could only come
away with one win.

In the first game of a Satur-
day doubleheader, the Pan-
thers came back from deficits
of 4-0 and 8-3 to capture a
15-13 win in an eight-inning

~ game.

Rich Lowman, who pitched
three innings in relief, was the
winning pitcher, while Mike
Claus, John Brush and T.J.
O’Leary were the hitting stars.

Claus was 4 for 5, Brush
went 3 for 4 with four RBIs,
and O’Leary was 3 for 5 with
two RBIs. ’

”The guys really fought
back. They never quit and
never gave up, and that's what
we need,” said Pitt coach Bob-
by Lewis. - _

Panther first baseman Dave
Westwood accounted for the
game winner with a two-run
homer in the top of eighth.

Pitt didn't fare as well in the
last two games of the series.
Villanova bombed the Pan-
thers in the nightcap of the
doubleheader 18-4,5 as Keith
Shuster took the loss.

Yesterday, the Wildcats took
the rubber game of the series
1 1-5.

. Said.Lewis, _-”We beat our-
selves and made a lot of mis-
takes that took us out of the '
game.”

Pitt's Frank Merigliano was
the losing pitcher in the game.
Outfielder Chuck Scales went

4 for 5 and O’Leary was 3 for
4. T
The loss dropped the Pan-
thers record to 5-9 overall and
2-4 in Big East play.
Villanova- improved to 22-9
overall. The Wildcats’ record
in league play isn't known.
Pitt is scheduled to face Vil-

Brush, Lamanti take every game seriously

By Teresa Varley

' For The Pitt News

Every team has to have a play-
er who plays every game aggres-
sively —— one who tackles practice
as if it were the World Series.

The University of Pittsburgh
baseball team, so to speak, got
two for the price of one. John
Brush and Gregg Lamanti can

 

easily be called aggressive ball
players. They are intense and take
each and every game and prac-
tice quite seriously.

”They both have a great per-
sonality for baseball,” said head
coach Bobby Lewis. ”They enjoy
playing. They work hard, and it
shows in their performance. They
also enjoy practicing, and that's
what it takes to be a good

Gregg Lamanti and John Brush — Pitt's aggressors

Your Student

player.”

Brush and Lamanti were both
brought up to be hard-nosed ball
players. They both played in the
city league — Brush at Peabody
High School and Lamanti at All-
derdice High School — and they
know that means you have to be
scrappy, a fighter.

”The way I was brought up in
athletics was to play aggressive-
ly,” Lamanti said.

”l play hard but, at the same
time, I want to have fun,” added
Brush. “'1 am always working at
it, though. I'm never satisfied with
my game. 1 also want to do
better.”

So far this season, both are do-
ing quite well. Lamanti is batting
.342, fourth on the team, and
Brush is right behind him at .313.
In Pitt's series against Seton Hall,
Lamanti had two home runs in a
7-6 loss to bring his season total
to four homers.

While some athletes have the
worry of balancing school and

sports, these two have an added
responsibility — work. They are
both members of the Pitt ground
crew, which means one extra
thing to balance — like a broom,
or a mop, or a rake.

”You learn to handle it,” Brush
said. ”There are times, like now
with finals, that you really have
to concentrate on school. Other
times you concentrate on base-
ball and work.

’’I wouldn't want it any other
way. The guys on the grounds
crew are great. It is a lot of fun.
They make you feel good and
take the worries off of your
mind.”

Another thing that helps take
worries off their minds is the fact
that in addition to being team-
mates, they are good friends.

"We always work out to-
gether,” Lamanti said. ’’If one of
us does something wrong, the
other is there to point it out, and

that helps. The team as a whole
is close, but it is good to have
someone around [on whom] you
can count.”

Another thing they can count
on is the coaching staff, especial-
ly coach Lewis. He always stress-
es the importance of school and
does not treat his players like
players but rather like in-
dividuals.

”We’re both thankful to coach
Lewis for the opportunity he has
given us playing here,” Lamanti
said. ”He is a great human being,
a great coach, and he is, in some
ways, a counselor for us. We
know we can talk to him
whenever we need to. He helps
us get through some tough
times.”

”The whole team has set the
goal to go to Connecticut for the
championships,” Brush said. ’’It
is a very good conference, high-
ly competitive. We feel that we
can make it, though.”

in five runs in the four—game ser-
ies, which concludes Monday.

’’I’m seeing the ball real well at
the plate, and I'm just trying to
concentrate on each at—bat,” said
Morrison, who had career highs
in homers (23) and RBI (88) last
season. ’’I’m not worried about
trying to do better than last sea-
son, I’m just trying to do what I'm
supposed to do each time I'm at
the plate.”

The Pirates, leading 4-3, chased
Cardinals’ starterlohn Tudor, 1-1,
with a three—run sixth. Rafael Bel-
liard tripled over center fielder
Willie McGee's head and Can-
gelosi followed with an RBI sin-

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 13, I987

Mize outlasts two starsto win Masters

By Bob Green
AP Golf Writer

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Larry Mize,
a native son of this old southern
city, turned back two stars of in-
ternational golf with a spectacu-
lar pitch-in birdie that won a
sudden-death playoff Sunday in
the 51 st Masters golf tournament.

Mize won the coveted green
jacket that goes to the Masters
champion with a pitch from
about 30 to 40 yards to the right
of the 11th hole, the second of
the sudden-death playoff.

Mize played the shot to the
fringe, then stood frozen in fasci-
nation as the ball took off, run-
ning straight into the cup. That
eliminated Greg Norman of Aus-
tralia, while Seve Ballesteros of
Spain bogeyed the first sudden-
death hole to drop out.

’’It’s a dream come true,” Mize
said. ”I’ve dreamed of winning
the Masters, but I never dreamed
of winning it like this — beating
two of the greatest golfers in the
world.”

The ball disappeared into the
hole like the flash of a cotton-tail
rabbit ducking into its burrow.

The quiet, soft-spoken Mize
leaped high_into the air, then
went hopping around the green,
raising both hands in elation and
clasping them to his head.

”Reporters have asked me all
week if I ever dreamed of win-
ning the Masters. I did,” Mize
said.

It was the climax of a struggle
in which six men either led or
shared the lead at one time or
another.

And it beat the two dominant
figures in golf today -— Norman,
the flamboyant ”Great White
Shark,” and Ballesteros, the Span-

~ish master who has won this

championship twice and owns a
couple of British Open titles.

They were Mize’s playoff part-
ners after all three finished the
regulation 72 holes in a tie for the
top at 285, only three shots un-
der par on the Augusta National
Golf Club course.

Mize birdied the 72nd hole
from about three feet to finish a
71 and was the first in the
clubhouse.

Ballesteros was next, and he
saved par from a bunker to set up
the playoff. He too had a 71.

Then came Norman, the out-
standing player in the world of
golf last year, whomoved into a
tie with a 20-foot birdie putt on
the 1 7th, then parred the 18th to
complete an erratic 72 that in-
cluded six birdies and as many
bogeys

The ninth playoff in Masters
history began on the 10th hole.

Ballesteros was eliminated
there. He 3-putted for bogey,
missing a five to sixfoot second-
putt. Mize had chance to win it
all, but he left a 10 to 12 foot
birdie- attempt hanging on the lip
of the cup. He tapped in. Nor-
man, who had missed a birdie
from about 20 feet, also made
par, and they went to the 11th.

Mize and Norman both drove
the fairway.

Mize pushed his approach far,
far to the right and turned his
back on the shot while it was in
the air.

Norman, the. current British
Open title-holder and perhaps

the most feared competitor in the .

game today, also put his ap-
proach to the right, on the fringe.

Mize needed to get up and
down from a difficult spot to have
any chance of extending the
playoff.

Instead, he pitched the ball in
the hole. Norman, now needing
a birdie to tie, missed his long
putt and became a Masters
runner—up for the second year in
a row. It marked the third, time in
the last five major championships
— which also include the U.S.
and British Opens and the PGA
—— that he has been second.

For Mize, it was only the sec-
ond victory of a six-year PGA

Tour career. The other came in
the 1983 Memphis Classic. He
had a chance to win last year's
Kemper, but he lost to Norman
on the sixth hole of a playoff.

Mize has had a half-dozen
runner-up finishes since the 1983
victory, and questions were being
asked about his
toughness.

He answered them in a strong,
firm voice, saving a bogey from
the water behind the 15th green,
gaining a playoff spot with a last-
hole birdie, then beating the best
the game can offer.

The victory was worth
$162,000 to Mize, who was born
and grew up in Augusta. He now
resides in Columbus, Ga.

”It’s the dream of a lifetime,”
Mize said.

Ben Crenshaw and Roger Malt-
bie, who shared the lead going
into the final round, and Jodie
Mudd each missed the playoff by
a single shot.

Crenshaw, the soft-spoken Tex-
an, held or shared the lead most
of the warm, windy day and relin-
quished a share of the top spot
only when he took three from the
back fringe and bogeyed the
17th. ‘

Crenshaw, the 1984 Masters
champion, was in the last group

mental’

to finish regulation play and
came to the 18th needing a bir-
die to tie.

He faced a 20-footer and
watched in dismay as his putt slid
by the hole.

He and Maltbie, an easy-going
35-year-old who hung around the
top most of the final round, each
shot 74 over the last 18 holes _and
finished at 286, two shots under
par.

Mudd, the beneficiary of a
magnificent start, also was at that
figure after a closing 69. Starting
play five shots back, he bolted
into contention with a birdie-
eagle—birdie beginning.

All three either led or-shared
the lead at one point or another
over the last 18 holes.

Curtis Strange and Bernhard
Langer of West Germany each
got to within a single shot at one
point or another.

But Strange played the back
nine in 40 and fell out of it.
Langer’s last hope disappeared
with his second shot into the
water of the 15th hole.

Langer dropped back into a tie
for seventh at 289, three shots
back of the group tied for fourth.

Also at one over par were Tom
Watson, Jay Haas, D.A. Weibring
and Jack Nicklaus.

Pat Santoro, sophomore,
wrestling team — Santoro only
lost twice all season long. He was
the national r-unnerup in the
142—pound division at‘ the
NCAAs. But since the man who
beat him is a senior, Santoro will
be the top returning 142-pounder
in thenation next year.

I like Santoro’s attitude. He
could have went to an estab-
lished wrestling -power such as
Lehigh, but he took a big risk by
coming to a no-name wrestling
school and giving it a name.

I like guys who take risks.

Have you noticed a trend here?
All of these athletes are under-
classmen. In fact, Lane, Heyward

‘and Santoro each have two years

remaining at Pitt.

It's hard to envision an all-
athlete team without a senior —
a performer who has put in his
dues and has seen it all pay off
in his/her last season of college.

Ido have one senior on my
squad, though. You probably
have a good idea who it should
be. Curtis Aiken and John Conge-

 

  
 

  
 

mi are logical choices. But I
chose a man who is more versa-
tile than those two. A man who
could have played two sports +
football and basketball — at Pitt,
but instead chose to spend the
majority of his time at 441 Wil-
liam Pitt Union. So without fur-
ther ado: .

Jim Urban, senior, Editor-in-
Chief, The Pitt News — If you've
never played hoops with Urban
(better known as Turbo) then you
may not agree with this. If you've
never seen Turbo throw a football
before you _won’t agree with this.

But this guy is just an incredi-
ble athlete. Rather than give my
own personal appraisal of Tur-
bo’s ability, I decided to call NBA
superscout Marty Blake and have
him evaluate Urban as a pro
basketball prospect. Here's what
the scouting report had to say:

Jim Urban, 5-11, 170, — Urban

Baltimore (AP) — Owner Ed-

, Clemens jogs off his opening gameloss

By Dave O'Hara
AP Sports Writer

Boston — It was a delightful
spring Saturday, sunny and mild
in mid afternoon.

Inside Fenway Park, a crowd of

P 34,000 cheered the Boston Red

Sox, even though they were trail-
ing the Toronto Blue Jays 4-I.

On tree-lined neighborhood
streets outside, a muscular young
man, dressed in shorts and a T-
shirt, jogged unnoticed.

What was Roger Clemens do-
ing outside running after being
shelled by the Blue Jays in his
1987 American League pitching

_ debuﬂ

”I needed some exercise in my

legs after pitching four innings,”
the 1986 AL Most Valuable Play-
er and Cy Young Award winner
explained matter of factly. ’’I
don't know how much work I
should be doing. I ran, so we'll
see how my legs feeltomorrow.”

Pitching against major league
hitters for the first time since the
sixth game of the World Series
last October, Clemens was rusty.

His 29-day boycott of spring
training in a salary dispute
showed.

Throwing batting practice to
youngsters at Spring Woods High
School in Texas was no substitute
for preseason games. ,

Neither was pitching six hitless
innings against Harvard Univer-

sity on April 4. Nor was a simu-
lated game with teammates at
Milwaukee last Saturday.

The hard—throwing right-hander
called ”Roc.ket” was rocked.

”He’s a fantastic pitcher, but
I've seen Roger throw better,”
said Toronto's Jesse Barfield, the
I986 AL home run champion
whose 30-foot single down the
third—base line drove in the tying
run in a four—run fourth inning
which finished Clemens.

After Barfield’s hit, Willie Up-
shaw lined his 100th career
homer into the right—field seats, a
three—run shot. The three—run
homer was the first off Clemens
since Reggielackson hit one July
8, I984.

THE PITT NEWS, Nlonday,’April 13,1987

"We did a pretty good job of
staying away from his high fast
ball,” Upshaw said. ”We made
him put it down in the strike zone
where we wanted it.”

”He had good velocity and his
fast ball exploded when he
pitched high, but when he got it
down in the strike zone, it just
didn't have the Roger Clemens
hump on it,” Barfield said.

After throwing 84 pitches, and
failing to go at least five innings

for the first time since before‘

shoulder surgery in 1984, Cle-
mens departed.

’ Most pitchers normally would
ice their arms, shower, dress and
head for‘ home. Clemens, though,
is unlike most pitchers.

Harrisburg sees baseball for first time in

_ By Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — The Harris-
burg Senators endured‘ an open-
ing day defeat at the hands of the
Vermont Reds, but the game's
outcome did little to dampen the
spirits of fans who have waited
impatiently for the return of base-
ball to the Capitol.

Satu'rday’s opening—day outing,
the first of 70 games scheduled

— this season at the rebuilt Riverside

Stadium, attracted some 4,000

= fans, including Gov. Robert P.

,

Casey, formeriGov. Dick Thorn-
burgh and Harrisburg mayor
Stephen Reed.
_ The game marked the first time
in 35 years a professional team
has played in Harrisburg, and
despite an 11-5 score, most fans
stayed in thestadium to the final
out. “
”|t’s long overdue. I think this

is great for the city of Harris-
burg,” said Larry Hamacher, a
city resident who was watching
the game with his wife, Fran.
”Since they started to get this
thing going, I've been really en-

- thused.”

The arrival of the Senators cul-
minated a four-year effort by city
officials to revamp the ailing
stadium and re—establish a base-
ball team here. The renovation ‘of
the stadium was undertaken as
part of a plan to improve the ci-
ty's waterfront along the Susque-
hanna River.

The Senators’ franchise, which
is part of the Pittsburgh Pirates
farm system, played in New
Hampshire last year‘. Following
negotiations with cityofficials,
the team agreed to relocate to the
new stadium. . ,

On Saturday, fans began filling

the bleachers about two hours ’

before the game, many wearing

team caps or red and white Sena-
tors T-shirts. Before the game
started, a Dixieland jazz band
played from atop the Senators
dugout, as fans mingled around
booths selling draft beer, hot dogs
and soda.

Casey, in an interview in the
grandstand, said he expected the
team to add ”a lot of color” to
Harrisburg and improve the qual-
ity of living in the area.

”Everybody of course starts out
the opener with a lot of opti-

mism,” the governor said. ’’I
think it's a real upbeat feeling
here today. I think [the team] will

add a lot to the color and flavor "

of the city.” _
Mike Wagenseller of-Marys-
ville said he saw the old Senators
play in the early 1950s. -
”I didn't think the public would
be so enthusiastic,” he said.
The game started as scheduled,
but team officials worked up to
the final minutes to prepare the
field, which had been saturated

He went jogging, then returned
to the clubhouse ”and did some
situps.”

And, after showering and cl ress—
ing, he hung around for postgame
interviews, as gracious as he was
en route to a 24-4 record, best in
the majors, last season.

”I had good stuff, I had bad
stuff,” Clemens said. "I'm going
to get my lumps here and there
until I get fine-tuned. '

"That swinging bunt by
Barfield was the big play, but
they've got some good hitters on

with rain in recent days. On Fri-
day, some areas of the field were
dug up to allow better drainage,
and just an hour before the game,
a helicopter hovered over center
field to help dry out the playing

risburg] a first-class professional
product. But there could be a few v

dent W. Scott Carter. He said,

Vasvary likes the way Kulig is

throwing javelin for track team’

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer

Sibling rivalry can be looked
upon as a negative aspect of
childhood, but in the case of Pitt
javelin thrower Tim Kulig, it has
been more than beneficial.

”I started track in the seventh
grade mainly because my bro-
thers did it,” said Kulig, who hails
from Lansdale, Pa.

Due to his interest in track, Ku-
lig began to excel in his senior
year at North Penn High School.
He was the state runner-up in the
javelin and was the winner of the
national high school champion-
ships that followed the state
games.

He then turned his sights
toward Pitt. ’’I liked the school.
My sister came here, andl came
to visit her a lot. I like the at-
mosphere,” said Kulig. J

Kulig may likea lot ofthings at
Pitt, but it's his coach who really

likes Kulig.

”Tim stepped in in his first'col-
legiate year —- he is the top jave-
lin thrower in the East and one of
the best in the country,” said Pitt
men's track coach John Vasvary.

That's high praise and a lot of
responsibility, but in Kulig’s first
season at Pitt, he showed he was

’ up to the task. He was named All-

Big East in the javelin for outdoor
track.

Kulig is looking forward to the
NCAA Championships for jave-
lin, but he also feels the team
needs to stay injury—free if it's go-
ing to make a run for the Big East
and national titles.

’’I think [the team's chances
are] good, ifwe stay healthy,” Ku-
lig said. ”With the team there's

' Lee [McRae], Dave Moore, Tim

Manes; they'll all be there — Bob
Weiner. The team should do
[really] well.”

As for himself, Kulig added:
”This year I hope to qualify. I just

want to make it.”

The javelin may be Kulig’s best
event, but in no way is it his only
one. His versatility allows him to
compete in the shot put, which
may compensate on-days that his
javelin throwing is off.

”He’s showed lots of improve- .

ment last year,” said Vasvary.
”Last year was his freshman year,
and Tim's been able to take the
chaHenge. ‘

”He scored in the Big East shot
put and didn't score in the jave-
lin,” added Vasvary.

Kulig, a junior education
major, is on a weightlifting sched-
ule in which he lifts three times
a week. He also relaxs by play-

ing golf. But for now, helping Pitt f

increase its strength by gaining
points in the field events is on top
of Kulig’s agenda.

”He’s done a good job all the
way around and has had a good
effect on the team,” said Vasvary.

The «Pitt men's track team
competed in the Dogwood
Relays in Knoxville, Tenn., last
weekendand came away with
admirable performances.

’’I was pretty pleased. There
were a lots: of good perfor-
mances,” said‘ Pitt men's track
coach John'Vasvary.

Calvin Holmes, Georgelfill,

— captured the Panthers lone

In the 800—meter run, senior
Tim Manes finished third with
a time of 1:50.02. Sophomore
Dave Moore placed fifth with
a time of 1:50.50.

Holmes came back to com-
pete in the 110—meter, high

’’All of the runners in this
meet qualified [for the |C4A
meet] except the shuttle-
hurdle relay because it is not
an IC4A race,” said Vasvary.

According to Vasvary, it was
a nice day, althought cool and

. windy, but there was good

competition.

”We had good perfor-
mances from the shuttle relay
— Tim Manes, Dave [Price],
Calvin [Holmes], Tim Kulig.

"A Iotiof guys qualified. We
split the team up — we want-
ed to get the relays as. strong
as possible,” Vasvary added.

McEnroe loses at championship

DALLAS (AP) — Czechoslovak-
ia’s Miloslav Mecir, who had not
won a set from John McEnroe in
two previous matches, beat him
decisively 6-0, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 Sun-

V day in the WCT Finals champion-

ship match.

Mecir, ranked fifth in the
world, earned $200,000, the
highest championship purse in
the 17-year history of the event.
McEnroe, ranked seventh in the
world, won $100,000.

Mecir played brilliantly‘ from
the baseline, consistently flicking
passing shots past McEnroe, a
four—time WCT winner. McEnroe
had problems in serving through-
out the match.-

Mecir broke McEnroe in the
third, fifth and seventh games of
the fourth set, then held serve to
capture the biggest title of his
career.

Mecir needed only 27 minutes
to win the first set — the first love
set lost by McEnroe since the
1985 Australian Open.

In the second set, McEnroe’s
serve improved, and he broke
Mecir in the seventh and ninth
games to win the set and even the
match.’

In the third set, there were serv-
ice breaks in six of the first seven
games. At one point, McEnroe,
continuing to berate chair umpire
Gerry Armstrong, threatened to
leave the court.

McEnroe, who had been
broken in the first game of the set,
complained that Armstrong
should have overruled on a tight
line call and began gathering his
rackets in a threat to retire from
the match. '

Armstrong, who issued a code
violation warning against McEn-

roe for a delay during a first-set
argument, assessed a penalty
point when McEnroe muttered an
obscenity. Armstrong said the
curse was ”audible.”

McEnroe approached the box
where Men's International Profes-
sional Tennis Council supervisor
Keith Johnson was seated, com-
plaining about Armstrong’s point
penalty. McEnroe claimed the
obscenity was not directed at
Armstrong. ' J

Johnson left his box, talked to
McEnroe, and McEnroe decided
to continue play.

~McEnroe told Armstrong early
in the match, ”I'm going to test
you the entire match. I'm going
to talk to you, .but I'm not going
to say anything you can make any
baloney about. C’mon, big boy,
do something about it.”

with the new stadium.
‘ The main grandstand, bleach-
ers and dugouts were completed,
but finishing work will continue
at the stadium for two months,
according to the mayor's office.

”It’s been very hectic. We
worked round-the-clock to get

this done. It's like moving into a
new house. When you get it, it's
not always livab|e,” Carter said.

Fans’ spirits were apparently
not affected by partially complet-
ed facilities. When the Senators
took the field for practice about

1 p.m. — their bright red and

white uniforms standing in sharp
contrast to the fresh sod — fans
gave a loud, cheering reception.

‘'1 expected a lot of mud, but
this is good baseball,” said Roy
Turner of Mechanicsburg. ”It’s
verygood to see an organized
teamlhere. This is our team.”

Chicago Bears brought in toinspire Pitt

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

If you're going to be champi-
ons, you gotta think like
champions.

So to get ”that championship
season thought process” ignited
among his players, Pitt football
coach Mike Gottfried has turned
to the guest speaker circuit for as-
sistance.

”We want you to get an idea
of what it really takes to be on
top,” Gottfried told his team be-
fore Friday’s practice. ’’So we're
going to be bringing in various
successful individuals to tell you
what they've been through, what
it's taken to get where they are
now.”

So whizzed in from the Windy
City were three linebackers from
the 1985 World Champion
Chicago Bears -— Mike Singletary,
Al Harris and Danny Raines.

Not a bad inaugural group.

the players first.

”I had the pleasure of coaching
Danny Raines while I was at Cin-
cinnati,” said Gottfried. ”When
he first came into the program,
the Bearcats weren't all that

‘ good. But by the time he left, Cin-

cinnati was a well—respected,
tough football team. Raines had
a lot to’ do with the changes

”Being a local guy,” Raines

ticular attention to what you guys

._ did. From what I've seen, the ta-
," lent here is enough to produce a
; championship team. You've got

to work extremely hard though,
or everything will go to waste.”

Harris, a former first-round draft
pick out of Arizona State, was
much more philosophical in ad-
dressing the players.

”When I was a sophomore in
college, our team was rated ex-
tremely high in the pre-season -—
some polls even had us at num-
ber one. Turned out we went 4-7
that year. There were just too
many guys resting on those pre-
season laurels, too many in-
dividuals on the field.”

Harris also discussed the
dangers of undergraduate athletes
dealing with agents, a topic that
hit home especially after the re-
cent controversy surrounding two

Mecir said it was a struggle to
maintain concentration during
McEnroe’s debates with the
officials.

”lt’s not nice to play in such an
atmosphere,” said Mecir, who

"won his fourth title of _I987.
. ”Sometimes it looks like he's go-

ing to do it [argue] again, then he
starts to play. I try to behave like
my parents [taught] me.”

McEnroe said his concentration

outburst.

”When that thing happened in
the third set, what I had going for

me —- getting a couple of breaks, '
hitting the ball better — it all _

seemed to cave said
Mc-Enroe.

McEnroe said the hip injury he
aggravated during Friday's semi-
final victory over Stefan Edberg
and Sunday's IO a.m. "starting
time also were factors.

”What are they having us get
up at 10 o'clock in the morning
for?” McEnroe said. ’’I don't think
it's good to have TV dictate when

”Don’t let those guys get in
your way. Don't let them blow
smoke at you, telling you how
good you are. One slip and you
can end up getting the whole pro-
gram in trouble. It's not worth it.”

Singletary, the 1985 Defensive
Player of the Year in the NFL, had
the least trouble in capturing his
audience's attention.

”Don’-t cheat yourself. What
you have here is a great, great
thing. As a player, your program
is the most important thing you
have. The coaches are here to do
whatever it takes to make you
good football players.”

Singletary recalled the road he
took in becoming what many
consider the ”best linebacker in
pro football.” .

”They said I was too small to
play in the NFL. But I kept work-
ing hard towards that goal. I
made up my mind about what I
wanted to do, and now here I am.
But it wasn't easy, I assure you of
that. . '

“Remember, a man who
makes up his mind is the hardest
to stop.”

All of this ”Be All That You Can
Be” and ”Get Up And Go” must
have had some effect on the play-
ers — a nasty brawl between the
offensive and defensive linemen
broke out during drills shortly af-

ter the players took the field for
practice.

”No! No!” the coaches yelled.
”Save it for the games!”

PANTHER NOTES: Gottfried
revealed potential changes that
may take place in the Panthers’
I987 schedule. Pitt's game at
Brigham Young, originally sched-
uled for Sept. 5 may be moved to
December to accomodate tele-
VlSlOn.

Meanwhile, the Kent State
game at Pitt Stadium, scheduled
for Nov. 21, may be moved to
early September.

Also, Gottfried noted that either
the West Virginia or Boston Col-
lege game will be moved to ac-
comodate television.

Guerrero wins 200 lndy—car race

By Mike Harris

AP /vlotorsports Writer

PHOENIX, Ariz. —— Roberto
Guerrero, starting last in the field,
overcame a stop-and—go penalty
and overpowered the rest of the
field Sunday to win the Checker
200 lndy—car race at Phoenix ln-
ternational Raceway. .

Guerrero, whose best previous
finish was second place in the
1984 Indianapolis 500 and twice
last season, beat defending
CART-PPG lndy—car champion
and 1986 lndy winner Bobby Ra-
hal to the finish line by a solid
8.62 seconds.

Guerrero, a 28-year-old
Colombian, had visions of the
1986 finale at Miami, where he
led all the way until running out
of fuel on the last lap, when he
was black-flagged into the pits
just 39 laps from the end of the
200-lap event.

’’I thought, ‘Uh, oh, here we go
again,’ ” Guerrero said.

He had opened a solid lead
over Rahal when the third and fi-
nal caution flag of the day came
out because of debris on the track
on lap 156. Rahal came into the
pits before the pace car took con-
trol of the field, costing him a lap.

— Rahal managed to beat Guer-
rero out of the pits and was at the
end of the lead lap when the
green flag came out again on lap
T61.

Meanwhile, Guerrero’s
Cosworth-powered March ran
over a tire lying in his pit as he
got restarted. Running over any
pit equipment is an automatic
penalty. The car is black—flagged
after the green flag comes out
again, and must come into the
pits and make a full stop before
leaving.

Guerrero accomplished that on
lap 166 and still came back onto
the one—mile oval 4.2 seconds
ahead of Rahal. He quickly

pulled away to leads of up to 12_
seconds and easily went on to the -

victory. 9

Guerrero averaged a track
record 138.020 mph, breaking
the record of 134.676 set last Oc-
tober by Michael Andretti,

It wasonly the fourth time in
lndy—car history that a driver has
started last and won. The late

Mike Mosley did it here in 1974,
Danny Ongais at Michigan in
1978 and Tom Sneva here in
1980..

Guerrero started from the back
of the 22—car field because his
third-place qualifying lap was dis-
qualified Saturday when it“ was
discovered his car was 24 pounds
light.

Mario Andretti, who had won
the pole for the second straight
year, led in the early going, with
Michael Andretti, his son, staying
with him. But both had handling’
problems and faded in the se-
cond half of the race.

Arie Luyendyk of Holland
finished third, a lap behind the
leaders. Michael Andretti was
fourth, followed a lap down by
his father and two laps back by
Josele Garza of Mexico.

The elder Andretti, who won a
week earlier at Long Beach, leads ~ ~
the CART point standings with
33, followed by his son's 24,
Guerrero with 22, Garza 18 and
Rahal and Al Unserjr. tied at 16.
