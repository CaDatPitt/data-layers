SEAC urges “Pitt: Hands off Mt. Graham”

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

Though it didn’t attract any
international media atten-
tion, it may have turned the
head of Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor.

Members of Pitt’s Student
Acnon
Coalition (SEAC) gathered in
front of the Cathedral on
Thursday to protest the uni-
ve_rsity’s possible involve-
ment in the proposed Mount
Graham International
Observatory project in
Arizona. It happened just
past noon, and the tempera-
ture hovered at 3Q degrees
as wisps of snow swirled in
the gusty wind.

As students crowded the
sidewalks traveling between
classes, two SEAC members
lowered a 30-foot long ban-
ner from a third floor win-
dow, that read “Pitt: Hands
off Mt.— Graham.” After two
or three minutes the banner
fell down when a stick sup-
porting it broke. “It looked
good while it was up there

' versity

though. It was quite a sight,”
said Matt Peters, an SEAC
representative.
Representatives from
Earth First!, Greenpeace,
SEAC, Catholics for Ethics
and Justice of Pittsburgh and
Pittsburgh Students for Peace

were presentat the protest.

Doug Furr, a spokesperson
for activist organization Earth
First!, came from Arizona to
Pittsburgh Thursday to meet
with group members in
opposition to the Mt.
Graham project. Speaking
into a battered portable
loudspeaker, he addressed
the few scattered people in
the crowd.

He asked, “Do you want
Pitt to support- the first uni-
[University of
Arizona] ever to argue in
court against religious free-
dom for traditional Native
Americans?” Protesto_rs
shouted .“No!” and beated on
a drum, while some specta-
tors clapped.

Furr explained that oppo-
sition to the proposed obser-
vatory became national in

scope when, in 1988, the
University of Arizona suc-
cessfully lobbied to bypass
laws which had previously
protected Mt. Graham from
development. He said that
environmental activism sur-
rounding the project is
increasing because of the
dangerous precedent it ‘sets
in weakening national envi-
ronmental protection laws.
“With this site change,
there’s a real likelihood that
it will bring more litigation,
guaranteeing to bring Pitt’s
share of the project’s cost
even higher. l hope that Pitt
and O’Connor will wise up
that it is a bad investment
and pull out,” Furr said.
After Furr spoke, Josh
Knauer, Western
Pennsylvania coordinator for
SEAC, and Matt Peters, head
of Native Issues for SEAC at
Pitt, took turns addressing
the students and non~stu-
dents who watched the
protest.

Pitt Greeks gamble for United Cerebral Palsy

“We had a great time,”
Sommer said. “It’s good for
people with disabilities to dis-

Panhel-sponsored

  

Over 100 Pitt students from
sororities and fraternities gain-
bled at a new Greek activity
on Friday night for United
Cerebral Palsy.

The event was Casino
Night, and Greek members
went to show their support

for the participants in the

Center ‘ for Personal
Development at the U.C.P.
House. Students socialized
with the participants, many of

whom suffered disabilities ,
‘ from cerebral palsy or severe

head injuries, while they
walked around using paper
money at various casino—type
booths. «\ .
Christiana Hahnfeldt, exter-
nal vice—president of the
Panhellenic Association, said
that she would like to see the
event
become a tradition. It was
initially held last spring during

event,” Hahnfeldt said. “By
doing activities like this we
find out how much we can
learn a lot by interacting with
the disabled.”

Hahnfeldt said it was also
important that fraternities and
sororities become more active
in local events to dispel the
notion that Greek activities are
exclusively social. She said
Greek members should be
able to have fun while con-
tributing to the community.

“It seemed like everyone
got involved and tried to get
to know others,” Pitt student
Bobbi Sobecky said. “It was
fun, and I hope we gave a
boost to the U.C.P. House.”

One of the organizers of the
event, Jill Sommer, called the
event a success and said the
65 participants from U.C.P.
appreciate community support
for their social events. ‘

cover that the Center for
Personal Development isn’t
just a place to come for class-
es. They can come to these
activities and have a good
time on a weekend. It’s a
good setting for them to learn
how to socialize.” '

Sommer said she was

encouraged by the initiative ‘

taken by everyone present to

V get to know each other. Last

year’s event was more struc-
tured because disabled people _
were paired with students for
the evening.

“Everyone mingled together
this year,’ Sommer said. “It
was nice to see students trying «
to relate and communicate
with people who have disabil-
ities.”

According to Sommer, the

. profit from this activity will go"

toward new fitness equipment
for the center.

_ §Pittopoly, a ver's'ion'"ofMonopoly adjusted

they did’ ‘include various l,campus_ landmarks".

§Here‘ at 7736 Pitt News, we decided to test
the game and see  it covered all aspects of
Pitt life'._J_ason Hillman, editor-in—chief;’_Jim

Lakely, ‘managing editor; Christine Birch,‘

graphics editor and myself took the challenge
after frnishing"II1ursday’s paper. We started at
a.m. I  '

First, we had to choose our token. In

Monopoly, the thirnble is always my favorite,
but the tokens are different in this game. We
got to choose between calculus, anatomy, art,
English and psych. Ichose the little wooden
English book.

Then, the banker was chosen; actually

'_ appointed. Lakely got the job and Hillman .
‘was the realtor. Each player then received

'3 1,200 in assorted colorful bills.

> So, let the game begin. Around 5:15 a.m., -
Lakely begins to become arrogant, because

he is doing well. Hillman buys 7799 Pitt News,
how ironic.

Lakely has in his‘ possession Pitt Stadium
and Trees'Hall, when Hillman purchases

Fitzgerald Field House. There goes that "
mono‘poly, Lakely!

“No one is going to have monopolies,”
Birch says." ' V n J ' ' _ " ‘
When you are playing'Monopoly, every-

one wants’ to lbuy4Boardwalk and Park Place.‘
'In_Pittopoly,_ the properties you want" to buy
 are the Cathedral of Learning and Hillman

Library. ' _
' Well, ‘I landed on the Cathedral block and

was not going to let that opportunity pass me

by.

“I wanted the Cathedral, it is the pillar of
education,” Lakely said.- .

It must not have bothered him too much,

because he had yet to lose his chuckle of
greed.

Hillman gets a car fine — pay $75. Lakely
has stated that he wants a whole block, and
Birch lands on Academic Probation and gets
sent home (equivalent to jail). I land on
Hillman Library, which is the first monopoly
of the - game. -A

Major trade is made between Hillman and
Lakely. Lakely gives him The Original Hot
Dog Shop and Hemingway’s Cafe for
Fitzgerald Field Hotrse and Fraternity Rush
(equivalent to Water Works). _ V

More monopolies have been made, and
Hillman acts on them. It is now time to build
houses and hotels. Let me rephrasethat, —
years of credit. In Pittopoly red pushpins,
without the pins, represent years of credit.
Once- each piece of property has four years
ofcredit, you can buy a diploma, a white
pinless pushpin.

_ : Hillman places two credits each on the O,

Hemingway’s and Uncle Sam’s Submarines.,I
then place one credit on Hillman Library and
the Cathedral. Then, Lakely places one credit

‘ on his sports monopoly.

Another round of turns adds more credits
to the board. Birch finds herself with only $1
left.

They are chock full of colorful
banners from Ireland, holiday
greetings from Germany,
Christmas trees from Norway and
beautiful ornaments from Poland.

But these are not the halls of
Western Europe, rather it is the
Cathedral of Learning. With the

‘ 5 Nationality Rooms decked out in

holiday ﬁnery from around the
world, it is beginning to look a
lot like Christmas.

The Nationality Rooms
Program kicked off the holiday
season Sunday with a free open
house on the first and third ﬂoors
of the Cathedral.

“I studied a lot of research and
read a lot of books to acquire
knowledge on the different tradi-
tions of the world,” said Maxine
Bruhns, director _of the
Nationality Rooms.

Bruhns, who donned an
Indian costume, said she certain-
ly did not do it all on her own.

For more than 40 years, the
Nationality Rooms have been
decorated by area residents on
the Nationality Rooms commit-
tees. ‘

Jane Pelczarski, a volunteer on
the Polish Room Committee, said
that they put a lot of time into
making decorations for the tree.

“The peasants of Western

‘ Europe used whatever was avail-

able to decorate their trees
because they were so poor and
humble,” Pelczarski said. In
keeping with that tradition, most
of the room’s decor was made
up of paper and other inexpen-
sive materials.

Among some of the "highlights
of this multi—cultural fair were a
Chinese dragon dance and a sim-
ulated Viennese coffee house set
up by the Austrian American
Culture Society. A wide variety of
ethnic entertainment was also on

hand, along with international.

make everyone feel “away from
home.”

Quo Vadis, a group of student
volunteers in national dress, were
available to welcome guests in
the rooms and to interpret holi-
day traditions.

According to Quo Vadis volun-
teer David Anthony, their training
is not all that easy. .

“As a guide, you have to learn
a little bit about each Nationality
Room and be aware of the cus-
toms,” he said.

Bruhns said that the more
experienced guides teach the
trainees and then they are given
written and_ oral exams. “They
basically learn from each other,”
she said. _ _

The fair also helped as a
means to make the public aware
of the need for an Austrian
Room, which is in semi—progress.
According to Joe Pandl and Joe
Novak of the Austrian American
Culture Society, they are about
$58,000 shy of creating the
Austrian Room.

“We’ve worked the last five
years at the Christmas open
house and we also have an
annual ball to try and raise
money for the room,” Pendl said.
“We even tried to get a hold of
Arnold Schwarzenegger.”

This year, 23 rooms represent-
ing the heritages of Eastern and
Western Europe, the Middle‘ East
and Asia were decorated. Bmhns
said that the committee is always
open to hear ideas for new
rooms and more old traditions
for the already established
rooms.

Tours can be scheduled in_

advance and will run Mondays
through Saturdays, 9:30 a.m. to 3
p.m. from Dec. 7 to Dec. 23 and
Dec. 26 through Dec. 30. The
rooms will be closed on Dec. 24,
25, 31 and Jan. 1. Tours are $2
for adults, $1 for senior citizens
and $.50 for children ages. 8
through 18. For reservations, call

BiGALA focuses on the issue of spirituality

By Lane Hornfeck
Staff Writer

Friday evening, the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian

. Alliance sponsored the first

Spirituality Panel discussion
on the ground floor of the
Cathedral.

. The Panel included
Unitarian Minister George
Exxso, Julie Smith of Dignity,
a Roman Catholic group, Geo
Custard of the Metropolitan
Community Church (MCC)
and Jack Pagan, representing
ideas from an alternative spir-
ituality. ‘

According .to Moira
Meadows, co—business man-
ager of BiGALA, the panel"
discussion was a way to pro-
vide a gay, positive environ-
ment for people to discuss
their spirituality.

Julie Smith, chair of the
Women’s Committee of
Dignity, said that the role of
dignity in the panel discus-
sion can show people (audi-

ence members) that spirituali-
ty and sexuality can be suc-
cessfully integrated.

“Dignity is [Pittsburgh’sl
longest, continuously-operat-
ing, non—business group for
gay, lesbian, bisexual people
and their friends. We just cel-
ebrated our 18th anniversary
the second Sunday in
October,” Smith said. “lThe]
goal of dignity is to work
back into the Roman Catholic
Church  to a comforting
place to worship.”

According to Smith, the
panel discussion should help
people to realize that they
can live morally, ethically
spiritual lives and be a sexual
person.

Geo Custard, a recent grad-
uate of the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary who is
preparing for clergy, feels that
it is important to give people
the opportunity to ask ques-
tions about spirituality.

“I’m here representing
Christian spirituality which is

affirming [of] bisexual, gay
and lesbian persons  MCC
welcomes all people, and we
stand in the message of Christ
that everyone is welcome and
can participate in God’s love,”
Custard said.

Meadows said that BiGALA,
wanted to provide a basis for
people to discuss the transla-
tion of the Bible from
Hebrew to other languages
and possibly address any mis-
givings — meaning that in
any ancient language, there
were words that modern lan-
guage does not necessarily
pick up on.

“So when translating from
any ancient language such as
Latin or Hebrew, it is likely
and inevitable that the true
meaning of a sentence or pas-
sage could be lost,”‘Meadows
said.

According to Meadows,
BiGALA would like to present
alternatives to Judeo—Christian
religions.

UPMC conducts research study 0

By Bruce Boul
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center is conducting a com-
prehensive research study on the
causes and factors underlying sub-
stance abuse.

The study will examine 200 traits
in children in the areas of physiolo-
gy, family environment and genetics
in order to determine which combi-
nation of traits would more likely
lead to drug or alcohol addiction
as the children grow older.

“Once we know this we can use
more effective prevention strategies
other than just billboards, commer-

cials and all that other bullshit,” said
Dr. Ralph Tarter, co-director of the
project.

According to the Center for
Education and Drug Abuse Research
(CEDAR), evidence has found that
up to about 2,500 different factors
in childhood can place children at
increased risk for subsequently
developing a substance abuse disor-
der.

The kinds of factors they are look-
ing for, according to Tarter, are a
family history of substance abuse,
alcohol ‘or drug use in the bio-
logical parent, high channel levels of
activity in the child, conduct prob-
lems and the child’s ability to

respond to fear stimuli, just to name
a few.

The program will then study the
children from age 10 up to age 50 to
insure a complete evaluation.

“We’re the only center like this in
the world that looks at kids for 20
years,” Tarter said.

The children are brought into the
lab with their families for extensive
interviews, questionnaires and brain-
wave testing.

Tarter said they even receive
information from police on neigh-
borhood crime where they live,
which often proves to be an impor-
tant factor.

“We basically evaluate the whole

 

and his or her relationship to
the parents, grandparents and even
aunts and uncles,” he said.

Families with or without a sub-
stance abuse problem who have
a 10 to 12-year-old son may be elig-
ible to participate in the research
study. Results of the study will
be used to create more effec-
tive drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs. Families who
qualify will receive a minimum of

$300.

CEDAR, which is conducting the 

study, is a consortium of Western
Psychiatric Institute and St. Francis
Medical Center.

Deena Buchanan, a
student standing on the
terrace above the foun-
tain, said, “It really
makes me mad
because I’m part
American Indian and
it’s desecrating sacred
lands. The people that
I descended from don’t
even exist anymore.”

Not all thepeople
standing in front of the

Mike Fitzpatrick, a

said that he didn’t

Another student, who
preferred to remain

At 12:50 p.m., the
group of approximately
30 protestors moved
into the Cathedral to
gather in O’Connor’s

Schuder, president of

presented petitions
containing 350 signa-

After nearly a half an
hour, Nancy White,

tense minutes speaking
to the protesting group.
White said that

O’Connor has “an open_

“He has not ruled out

White collected names
and phone numbers of

the representatives for g

assured the group
that O’Connor would

about the uselessness of continu-

' ing the game. “It’s just delaying

the inevitable,” he says with
over—confrdence.

Lakely once again spouts off to
Hillman. “There is a Go to Pitt
Stadium card and you are going
to get it’? Lakely then lands on
Contingency (equivalent to
Chance) and picks up the card
that says, “Pitt vs. Penn State.
Advance token to Pitt Stadium.
Go Pitt!” Better luck next time.

Lakely then lands on Hillman
Library and has to shell out
$1,500 to Hilhnan. Hillman then
says, “Now who’s winning?”

The game is now going back
and forth. It is 5 a.rn. and it is
really beginning to drag. Birch
decides that we will count
money and find out who the
winner is at 5:15 am:

“Jim is in bitter-old-man stage,”
Hillman says with good reason
— Lakely is pouting.

At 5:15 a.m., the money and
property are counted. Hillman
has $11,140, and Lakely has
$7,655.

Other properties on the board
are Stephen Foster Memorial,
Heinz Chapel and the William
Pitt Union; Frick Fine Arts
Building, the Medical School and
the Law School; CJ; Barney’s and
Sorrento’s Pizza; and Forbes
Quad and Pennsylvania Hall.

In place of railroads, there are
streets. You have the chance to
land on Forbes Avenue, Fifth

“Recite the fight song or lose one
turn,” “Place $10 in center of

Do Your Laundry” or “Open

The company that created the
game received insight for it from
Pitt graduates and students.
Overall, I think they did a good
job of covering campus. I think
there are other places, like David

Lawrence or Dave and Andy’s, ,_

that could have been included.

“I liked the game,” Lakely said.
“Gee, now I know how it feels to
be Pitt for one night, buying
everything in Oakland.”

Birch also liked the game. "I
guess it really brought out the
true nature in people," she said.
"And even though Mr. Ruthless
bankiupted me in the first half-
hour, I still had a good time. But
I want a rematclil"

Hillman said it is just like
Monopoly, just specialized for
the Pittsburgh area.

The company, which started in
1984, has also created games for
universities like “Orangeopoly”
for Syracuse; “Hoyaopoly” for
Georgetown; “Gatoropoly” for
Florida; and “Irishopoly” for
Notre Dame. Altogether the
company has 75 games on the
market.

Pittopoly can be bought at
Kaufmann’s Department Store
and the University of Pittsburgh
Book Center.

The city of Baltimore, Md., home of one of the
highest teenage pregnancy rates in the nation, is
indicative of a growing problem that both threatens
the very livelihood of our nation’s youth and
accentuates its troubles. In 1990, the latest year in
which statistics were available, an alarming rate of

one in 10 girls between the ages of 15 and 17 got

pregnant.

In an election year where both ends of the politi-
cal spectrum were debating about what constitutes
a family the one thing that both sides seemed to
agree on is that it is not a 15-year-old mother.

To halt this disturbing trend, the Baltimore School
District, like most big city public school systems in
this country, has distributed condoms to its stu-
dents. However, Baltimore schools have not
stopped there. The district has taken it one step
further to distributing birth control pills. Now it
plans on moving way ahead of the pack. Beginning
in January, this city will expand the free contracep-
tive choices its students already have to include
Norplant. .

Norplant is a device that is inserted under the

skin of a woman’s upper arm and releases a con-

traceptive hormone. It may be effective in prevent-
ing pregnancy, but distributing it to children goes
too far. -

For one thing, the cost of the implant is outra-
geous. With the $300 to S700 price tag, schools
could use this money for more constructive things,
such as books. Secondly, Norplant is portrayed as
the “be-all and end—all” in terms of preventing
pregnancy. While it may be effective in this area, it
does nothing to stop disease. At a time when most
people think “disease won’t happen to me,” the
distribution of Norplant ignores an equally relevant
problem. _ 

We do not have a problem with the distribution
of condoms or birth control in the public school
systems. Today, more and morechildren are sexu-
ally active at younger ages. The distribution of con-
doms and birth control pills goes a long way
toward teaching children that if they’re going to

have sex they should at least be responsible.

Providing Norplant to children, however, teaches
just the opposite —- irresponsibility. One principal
went so far to say,  [Norplant] lets them go on
with their lives without worrying about getting
pregnant or remembering to get their birth control
prescriptions filled.” '

This statement is cause for alarm because the
whole notion of forgetfulness is, in fact, encour-
aged. HIV and venereal diseases must be of equal
concern here. The Baltimore School District and
others considering this plan of action should recon-
sider. ’ ' ' ‘ ’

Somalia didn't always have trouble

The attention of the world
has focused on the African

9 nation of Somalia. The Somali

people are besieged by famine,
which has claimed the lives of
thousands and threatens thou-
sands more. Yet the portrayal
of the Somali crisis by the
media has been displayed with
no account of the nation’s his-
toiy and its relationship to the
western powers which are now
posed to rescue it.

Mogadishu, the Somali port
which U.S. troops will soon
infiltrate, was once a member
of the East African Swahili city-
states. As far back as 970 A.D.,

-the Swahili city-states formed a

network of trade which extend-
ed from Mogadishu in the
North‘ to Sofala of present-day
Mozambique in the South-

‘Through trade links between

the Swahili city-states, the
African inland and Arabs of the
Persian Gulf, the Swahili soci-
ety, including the city—state of
Mogadishu, claimed a culture
which was rich and an econo-
my that was prosperous.

Trade was the main source of
Swahili prosperity. As a mid
point between the African
inland and the Persian Gulf, the
Swahili peoples were able to
export gold, ivory, amber-gris
and mangrove poles along with
their agricultural produce. The
Swahili also manufactured cot-‘
ton, cloth, glass and shell
beads. Mogadishu itself was
noted to have been built almost
entirely of coral stone, display-
ing its wealth.

Today, the achievements of
the Swahili city-states may
appear to be nothing spectacu-
lar. But their achievements
were made possible through
economic and political organi-
zation unique among the
majority of non-African nations
of that time. By blending the
economic and political spheres
with the spiritual realm of tradi-
tional African religion and
Islam, the peoples of the East

African Coast were able to

advance as a union with a

strong moral base, something
which the U.S. government
appears to be lacking.

The Swahili society existed
in a period which preceded the
Bubonic Plague of Europe,
which put the continent into a
temporary cultural decline. It
preceded the fatal conflicts
between the European papacy
and secular rulers, in which
European religious leaders and
political heads could not reach
a compromise as to how their

  Ras Oscar
Ebyers

nations should be governed.
The Swahili society was also
grounded before the European
Great Schism, in which the
northerners were bafﬂed by the
existence of two popes. Even
further, Swahili society preced-
ed the Italian Renaissance by
approximately three centuries
and the Age of Enlightemnent
by seven.

One may ask where the irony
of the present stems from, see-
ing that now Mogadishu and
Somalia are plagued by famine
and it is the West which must
assist with its recourses. In
1498, Portuguese explorers in
search of West African gold
and a sailing route to India
encountered the Swahili soci-
ety. Henceforth, the traditional
pattern of European contact
with what they viewed as
“new” land followed. The

‘Portuguese demanded that the

Swahili rulers pay annual trib-
ute to the king of Portugal.
When they refused and the
Portuguese demands were not
met, the city-states were
bombed by cannons from the
Portuguese ships, raided and
conquered. This destroyed the
political and economic strength
of the entire Swahili society,
from Mogadishu to Sofala.

The history of the Swahili
city-states with the Portuguese
reﬂects the history of all African

peoples with the Europeans.
By conquering the African land
and dividing it into European
colonies, Africa was denied its
indigenous culture and high
standard of living, of which
even the nobility of Europe
were envious and in awe.
Ethnic groups which co-existed
for centuries were splintered
and divided, leaving Africans in
dispute with one another over
territory, as we see in Somalia.
Ultimately, disasters such as

famine have arisen, contrasting

the rich African past. It is
extremely important, for the
benefit of truth, to remember
that only in the recent year of
1960 were the Somali able to
rid themselves of European-
imperialist presence and
achieve political independence.

It is only natural that certain
African leaders are weary of
foreign presence on its soil.
Many may argue that this is the
combirfed force of the United

,Nations, unlike the European-

imperialists of earlier times.
Regardless of the matter,
Africans remember that in 1935
the Italians, who occupied the
Somali coast during the 18005,
attacked Ethiopia. At this time
Ethiopia was ruled by Emperor
Haile Selassie I and was a
member of the League of
Nations. When the emperor
requested the protection of the
League of Nations, which was
created by the United Nations
to protect smaller nations from
attack of those which are larg-
er, they ignored his request and
did not help him. The Italians
were allowed to att,ac.k
Ethiopia, and, after a hard war,
they defeated the nation by
bombingvillages and spreading
poisonous gas in the air, killing
innocent civilians. Who can
blame the Africans for being
reluctant to allow members of
the European race onto their
land, whether as friends or
foes? .m".:.=]'i<.-<';x’j.v‘:

If trying to topple the second—ranked

_women’s volleyball team in the country is

comparable to trying ‘to chop a tree down
with a Swiss army knife, then the Pitt
Panthers came to Maples Pavilion at
Stanford University Friday night and found
out that the tree may as well have been
made of granite.

Playing against superior competition, the
underpowered Pitt Panthers (18-14) fell to
the Stanford Cardinal (27-2) in straight sets
15-3, 15-2, 15-4 in a first—round match in the
NCAA Tournament in Palo Alto, California.

Pitt was dominated in every facet of the
match by the Cardinal volleyball machine,
as All-America hitter Bev Oden and Co.

blasted home 41 kills (at a .478 hitting per-
centage) and combined for 21 blocks to
send the Panthers back to the ‘Burgh. Pitt
was also plagued by poor hitting (17 kills
and 17 errors for the match, .000 hitting per-
centage) and serving (eight service errors),
which contributed to the massacre. _

“It was like hitting practice for them,”
sophomore middle hitter ‘Melanie Gustafson
said. “Anytime and anywhere they wanted
to hit the ball, they hit it.”

Oden, a senior middle hitter who was the
last player cut from the 1992 U.S. Olympic
Team, dominated up front, recording 11
kills, seven digs and two blocks for the
match. Her kill total was more than Pitt’s
middle attack of Gustafson (two kills), Sarah
Mikla (four) and Alyssia Yanik (three) com-
bined.

basketball 70-59 de 

By Jason Brame
and Neil Chaudhuri
The Pitt News

What is it about Iowa
basketball? Maybe it’s the
corn or maybe it’s the —
corn. Whatever the rea-
sons, the University of
Iowa Hawkeyes handed
the Pitt Panthers their first

‘ loss of this young season,

a 70-59 defeat at Fitzgerald
Field House.

Fresh off their first win
of the season against
Duquesne, Pitt had hopes
of upsetting the seventh-
ranked team in its home
opener. It never material-
ized. The Hawkeyes uti-
lized an unrelenting full-
court press and timely

shooting to down the
Panthers.
Iowa head coach

Marianna Freeman had lit-
tle to go on to prepare for
the Panther attack. '
“We knew about them
from watching tapes of
them from last year,”
Freeman said, “We picked
up a tape A from the
Duquesne game last night,
too.” I 2
Iowa capitalized on 17
points and four assists
from point guard Laurie
Aaron‘ to key their offen-
sive game, but the defense
set the tone for the victo-
ry...’ ....
“We’re known more for
our defense; we’re not an
offensive team,” Freeman
said. “Our goal was to
play good solid defense
today. We wanted to start
on the defensive end and
let it kick in our offense.”
Implementing a zone
defense early in the game,

- Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce

watched his team quickly
fall behind by eight points.
Panther forward Turia
Ransom canned a jumper
to tie the score 2-2 at
19:11 of the first half, but
the Hawkeyes rolled to an
8-0 run to capture a 10-2
lead.

Pitt guard Erin Maloy
countered with two
straight three-pointers, half
of her 12 points for the
night, to stifle the run and
give the Panthers some
momentum.

The. Panthers cut the
lead to two at 12:42 of the
first quarter but Iowa grad-
ually increased its
strength, garnering a
seven—point advantage that
it would never relinquish.

The second half was
much like the first in that
the Panthers managed to
cut into the lead but then
watched Iowa step up the
pressure and register three
or four unanswered hoops.
The Hawkeye lead was as
big as 18 points and was
as small as seven, yet once
the second half began the

tedious

outcome was never really
in doubt.

Despite Iowa’s tremen-
dous size advantage, Pitt
managed to work the ball
inside effectively. Ransom,
the tallest starter at only
six feet, tied for a game-
high with 17 points
despite being matched up

against 6’5” center Kathy ‘

Marx.

Had it not been for a
mandatory replacement
midway through the sec-
ond half due to blood on
her jersey, Ransom would

have almost certainly
matched her career high of
21 points.

“[1 was a little intimidat-
ed] at first, because when
you look at them it was
like 6’1”, 6’1”, 6’5” but
after the first minute, I was
fine,” Ransom said. “I just
wanted to do the little,
things against
them: boxing out, making
my shots and just basically
doing my thing.”

Bruce argued that he did
not have a set offensive
game as far as pounding
the ball into the low post.

:Using accurate" passes to
the ‘
Panthers managed to offset’

open forwards,
the size difference in cre-
ating open, 'mak'e‘able
shots.
“'That’s,

the way the

I game is played,” BrLrc"e

said. “You don’t all the
time have to have set
plays to get the ball inside.
When you’re open you
have to get the ball to
open players, and your
open player has to score.”

Defensively the Panther
zone limited Iowa’s first-
shot power. Ransom held
Marx to just four points
and backup 6’2” center
Andrea Harmon to just
tWO.

It was on the offensive
glass that the Hawkeyes
club held the advantage.
Outrebounding the
Panthers 15-10, Iowa
turned many missed shots-
into easy stickbacks while
Pitt failed to convert its
own second—shot opportu-
nities.

The Hawkeye defense
also managed to keep
Panther threat Jonna
Humerich out of the game.
The 6—foot forward never
seemed to get into any

kind of rhythm. Though.

she shot well in spurts and
finished second in scoring
for Pitt with 14 points,
Humerich was not her
usual, consistent self.

“I guess I‘ played a little
better in the second half,”
Humerich said. “It took
me a little longer to heat
up than usual. I wanted to
get more into the offensive

flow in the second._hal:ﬁ;Z

  Pitt’ women swim second

By Jeﬂ'Kamis
and  Silverman
ibe Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swimming and
diving team saw more splashes this
weekend than at the bus lane on
Fifth Avenue. No, they weren’t
watching any lonesome pedestri-
ans getting soaked by PAT buses
in the pouring rain, they were at
the pool.

With 28 swimmers and divers,

the Miami University (Ohio)-

Redskins ﬂooded the preliminary
rounds on their way to victory in

the Seventh Annual Pitt Invitational

this past weekend at Trees pool.
Miami’s depth and the open for-
mat allowed them to score as

' many as seven or eight swimmers

in individual events. As _opposed to
the Big East Championships, the
Pitt Invitational sets no require-
ments on the number of events an
athlete may swim in or the number
of participating members on a
team.

The lady Panthers took second
place overall with 831 points,
behind Miami’s 1,065. Maryland
finished third with 447 points, fol-
lowed by Virginia Tech with 404
and Connecticut with 387 points.

Pitt and Miami took first place in
every event except the 50-yard
freestyle, where Connecticut’s
Jennifer Lyons took top honors.

Besides taking home the overall
points award, Miami had some
impressive individual perfor-
mances. Sophomore Shannon

first-year swimmer Christie Danford
dominated her individual events.
Danford won the 100 and 200
backstroke and both the 200 and
400 individual medleys.

Another ﬁrst-year swimmer who
starred this weekend was PitI’s Jill
Fletcher, who won the 100 and
200 breaststroke. Fletcher was also
a member of Pitt’s winning 200
and 400 freestyle relay teams.

“Jill is a fantastic swimmer, and
we will look for her and the rest of
the freshman swimmers to con-
tribute for the rest of the season,”
Pitt co—captain Clare McShane said.

Panther head coach David
Belowich said he was - also
impressed with his rookie swim-
mers and divers this weekend, call-
ing the entire meet a stepping
stone toward the second half of the
season. -

“This is the spot that we wanted
to be in to move forward toward
the end of the season, so now we
go from there,” Belowich said.

McShane, who took first in both
the 200 and 500 freestyle, said that
she was also happy with her indi-
vidual performances to a degree.

“I’m very pleased with the victo-
ries, but I just wish the times were
a little better,” McShane said. \

Sophomore Christy Knobloch,
who was a member of the winning
800 freestyle relay team and took
second in both the 200 backstroke
and 100 butterﬂy, said team chem-
istry was defrnitely a factor this
weekend.

exactly what we did,” Belowich
said. “We talked about that
[Friday] a lot, and it was nice to
see it happen.”

The most successful portion of
the weekend for Pitt was the div-
ing competition In Friday night’s
three-meter diving, first-year
diver Sunday Lewandowski set a
school and Trees pool record on
her way to the title. On Saturday
night, Lewandowski continued
her winning ways with another
victory in the one-meter compe-

tition

Diving Coach Julian Krug said
he was not particularly surprised
by Lewandowskfs successes.

“She is a very good competitor
with outstanding talent, and I
can’t be surprised because I
know she can do it,” Krug said.

Pitt senior diver and co-captain
Donna Flatch reinjured her knee
when she slipped attempting her
final dive in the one-meter com-
petition. Krug said that he was
unsure of her status after her fall.

Hawaii

Continued from page 9
Perkins, Pitt’s defense was
effective in stalling Hawaii’s
wishbone offense. Hawaii
was held to one touchdown
and zero passing yards.

Pitt led by nine, but the
opening of the fourth quarter
signaled a return to reality
for Pitt and a return of the
frustrations that have

plagued the Panthers all sea-

son.
Penalties, turnovers and
special team breakdowns
returned as a major part of
Pitt’s game. The Panther
offense sputtered when the
pressure was on, while
Hawaii quarterback Mike
Carter led the Rainbow
attack through several impor-
tant “make or break” plays.
Fifteen minutes and 159

yards later Hawaii had
almost covered the 16-point
spread. -

Interim head coach Sal
Sunseri said the result was
disappointing after Pitt
achieved his foremost goal
—- controlling the line of
scrimmage through the
majority of the game with an
offense that featured an
unexpectedly successful run-
ning game.

Pitt opened the game with
Van Pelt moving the offense
on passes to Jells and Bill
Davis. The Hawaii defense,
concentrating on Martin in
run situations, was caught
offguard by fullback Lyron
Brooks, who picked up two
first downs. Martin finished
the drive with a 5-yard run
up the middle for a touch-
down. ‘

The defense forced Hawaii
to punt on its first posses-
sion, but the Rainbows
regained the ball four plays
later after Martin fumbled at
the Pitt 47-yard line. Once

again, the Pitt defense‘-held
Hawaii, which counted ‘on
senior running back Travis
Sims to run three of its four
plays. All-American kicker
Jason Elam missed a 47-yard
field goal to the right in
Hawaii’s first attempt to get
on the board.

In Pitt’s third possession,
Martin’s relentless attack was
complemented with runs by
Jermaine Williams and Tim
Colicchio to Hawaii’s 17.
Conley extended the Panther
lead to 10-0 with a 54-yard
field goal.

After trading possessions,
Hawaii senior Derrick
Branch returned a punt for a
56-yard score to slice the
Panther lead to three.

On Pitt’s next drive Martin
burst up the middle for a 28-
yard TD behind Brooks’ lead
block.

Hawaii entrusted the next
drive to slot back Eddie
Kealoha, who accounted for
54 yards of its 79-yard drive,
including a 46-yard TD run.

Pitt finished the half with
,ma drive including several
receiving and running yards
by Martin, setting up
Conley’s 31-yard field goal
giving Pitt a 20-14 halftime
lead.

Hawaii opened the second
half by driving to the Pitt 27
behind the option running of
Carter and Sims. Pitt got a lift
when the ‘Bows, down by
six, elected to go for it on

fourth and one. Inside linle-,

backer Charles Williams
sacked Carter to end the
threat. ,

Pitt took over and drove 45
yards behind passes _to Jells
and Bill Davis, as well as
some option—type run plays
to Martin. Conley kicked the
field goal to boost the lead

Hawaii

Continued from page 12
to.2,2;,'-14.._. 

.As the third quarter closed,
Hawaii appeared to hit the
panic button. It attempted
consecutive lateral passes to
back up quarterback Ivin
Jasper, one gaining a
Rainbow first down. Hawaii
began using a “triple receiv-
er” offense to muster up
some yards.

The turning point came five’

plays later when Pitt
switched into a prevent
defense to stop the changed
offense. Hawaii reverted from
the trips offense, and Sims
burst through the middle on
a quick hitter and ran 32
yards for the TD.

Williams, who had stopped
Sims most of the game, was
takenlout for the prevent
defense.

Pitt, now clinging to a 23-
21 lead, punted away its next
possession. Hawaii took over
on its 25 and rolled through a

tired Pitt defense. The drive ,

was capped by a 28-yard TD
pass from Carter to receiver
Matthew Harding.

It was Martin’s run on Pitt’s
next drive that was the
game’s most controversial. A
late hit on Martin (Pitt side-
line) escalated to a shoving
match which included the

entire Hawaii team running
across the field to join in. For
more than 30 seconds the
fight ran out of control.
When the officials and
coaches regained order, to
the Pitt sideline’s disbelief
the only penalty assessed was
a 5-yard unintentional face
mask. ~

Jells caught a 12-yard pass
on the drive, passing Henry
Tuten for the school record
for receptions in a single sea-
son.

Pitt’s drive came to a halt
five plays later when Van Pelt
was sacked, and Pitt was
forced to kick a field goal
down 28-23. Conley’s attempt
was blocked after a high
snap, and the Panthers could
feel their chances of victory
slipping away.

Once again Carter and Sims
teamed up for all of the
Rainbow offense and locked
a Hawaii victory with their

E"-47-yard scoring drive plus a

two—point conversion.

Pitt’s final possession was a
bitter reflection of Pitt’s worst
season in 18 years.

After Van Pelt hit Jells and
Chad Askew for big gains,
Martin fumbled the ball inch-
es from the goal line and
Hawaii recovered for the
touchback.

has two other injured performers in senior
Joanne Warner (foot) and sophomore
Niambi Daniels (foot). In this meet,
Warner finished third in the shot put.

Lewis felt that Pitt’s being a well-round-
ed team is a strong point for this year.

“Our strength seems to be the ability to
compete and score in 13 of 14 events,”
Lewis said. “We have an experienced

senior class and an enthusiastic and moti-
vated freshman class.”

The only weakness that Lewis felt his
team has is overall team experience, con-
sidering that a large number of the athletes
are first-year students.

The next meet for Pitt is over a month
away when the team runs in the Father
Diamond Invitational held at George
Mason on Jan. 9.

shot and not force it.”

The team’s lack of consis-
tent backcourt scoring was a
product of the Hawkeyes’
unrelenting press and tight
man-to-man defense.

Led by defensive maven
Aaron, Iowa forced Pitt into
26 turnovers.

“The press is something
that you have to constantly
work on,” Bruce said. “Each
team is different, but [Iowa]
is like buzz saws — they’re
everywhere. I thought we
turned the ball over times
where there were unforced
errors, but I also thought
there were times when we
made the correct play.
Sometimes when you break
the press it’s not as easy as it
looks.”

Necole Tunsil and.Toni
Foster complemented Aaron’s
17 with 15 and 13, respec-
tively, but according to
Bruce, the opponents’ scoring

 

Basketball

onday, December 7, 1992

went pretty close to planned.

“When their guard is their
leading scorer than we’re
doing the right thing,” Bruce
stated. “The game prior to
this, the only game we had to
[scout them] on, was against
a Czechoslovakian club team,
and 54 of the 78 points they
scored were by their inside
players. That would tell me
that we don’t want all of their
post players doing all the
scoring; so if one of their
guards got 17, we did our
job.” ‘

With this game in the
books, Pitt now looks for-
ward to Penn State tonight at
Fitzgerald.

The Nittany Lions knocked
off the ninth-ranked Texas
Longhorns last week in a big
upset victory.

The Panthers have a tough
task ahead of them, but as
both Ransom and Humerich
put it, “We want to win; we
can win.” '
