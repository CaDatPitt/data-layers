Posvar said overcrowding is

He pointed to the proposed

Legislature has approved,

niversary in 1990, and plans
are already underway for a
celebration to send the club
into its next cen_tury.

The Pitt Men's Glee Club,
one of the oldest student or-
ganizations on campus, is,
comprised of tenor and bass
singers from all schools of the
‘ '3-university. It has entertained
' audiences worldwide for near-
ly a century, a heritage that the
club's members are very
proud of. '

John Brice, president of the

club, stated, ”We are older
than all other university clubs,
including the Student Govern-
ment [Board] and [Pitt] Pro-
gram Council.”
at The group also prizes its
standards. ”We are not a
drinking or purely social or-
ganization,” said Brice.
‘ ”Being a member of Glee
Club is rewarding in that the
members are people who just
like to get together and make
music. It is more enthusiasm,
rather than talent, that makes
Glee Club the experience it
is," Brice added.

The variety of music per-
formed by the Glee Club
ranges from classical to coun-

, try to modern pop, and they _ , ,

for Pitt's use.

Israel allows Egyptian fla

JERUSALEM (AP) ~— Israel
agreed Sunday to let Egypt raise
its flag over the disputed Taba
border area in a symbolic conces-
sion reflecting lsrae|’s plans to
return the 250-acre beach strip to
Egyptian rule.

Israel acceded to Egypt's re-
quest to fly its flag in an attempt

"to get talks moving on the last ob-

stacles before the land along the
Red Sea is handed back, said For-
eign Ministry spokesman Alon
Liel. »

”We hope this decision will
help defuse the tensions that have
been created in the past few days
and enable the working commit-
tees to resume their talks,” Liel
said.

He said Egypt's ambassador to
Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny,
was pleased by Israel's response.

The talks over Taba ran into
trouble last week when Egyptian
officials said they would consider

' the land to be under Egypt's

sovereignty as of Sunday, 60 days
after an international arbitration
panel sided with Egypt.

The declaration alarmed Israe-
li officials, who first want to set-

United States, were on Cuba at
the time of the crisis in October
1962.

Pitt's best friend?

New director of Campus Police makes some changes

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

The picture is of two children,
walking up a Philadelphia street
with their arms around each
other. The caption under it reads
”For Bill Brennan — Philadel-
phia's Best Friend.”

For Brennan, the new director
of Public Safety at Pitt, the picture
sums up his ideals, even more
than the awards from the Phila-
delphia police department that
share his office wall. The picture
was a gift from a Philadelphia
resident.

’’I was instrumental in develop-

E ing a new philosophy of commu-

nity relations in the Philadelphia

police,” Brennan says. ”Now I
am going to do it here.

”The key word here is partner-
ships. The Campus Police officer
will no longer be just a police
officer. He will be a friend of the

The fear of crime is
just as important as the

incidence of crime.
— BIII Brennan

community, ready to help the
people, regardless of the sit-
uation.”

The approach is not new to

II

Brennan. He built a 19-year
career on it, making peace be-
tween Philadelphia residents and
police in a neighborhood where
there had been friction for near-
ly two decades.

Brennan left the Philadelphia
police because he felt that Pitt
had ”something to offer me.

, There came a time in my life

when l realized there was more
I could do. I recognized Pitt as a
tremendous opportunity.”
Brennan says he feels that the
Campus Police are a tremendous
unit, which is demonstrated by
the fact that the city police recog-
nize them as an ally, not a subor-
dinate — an unusual situation for

a campus department. Still, there
is ‘room for improvement, he
adds, particularly in their relation-
ship with the community.

Part of the new direction in-
volves promotions for key mem-
bers of the department in a
ceremony at the University Club
tonight. Brennan rewards good
employees and will not let any-
one hurt his program.

”We had to fire him,” Brennan
says of the man who had just
stormed out of his office. ”He
was consistently late [for work].
We can't develop these partner-
ships if we're not here. if I run
into people who are not recep-
tive, I will do my best to remove

them.”

Even though he has only been
director for two weeks, Brennan's
ideas seem to have caught on.
Training Sgt. Timothy Delaney,
who will be promoted to captain
tonight, says, ”i think he is a
natural leader. His style is easy to
follow, and his energy has been
contagious.

”We didn't have to slow down
operations for him. He didn't
really need an orientation period.
He just blended in," Delane
adds. '

One of the most striking parts
of Bill Brennan's personality is his
self—confidence, which never

”The Bellefield Annex is
really a higher priority with us
because we can get rapid re-
sults. It will free up space [in
the Cathedral of Learning] and
in the Forbes Quadrangle
building  This is the critical
solution which will break the
logjam,” he noted.

Posvar said the Offices of
Development, Public Affairs
and Alumni Affairs will likely
move into the building Pitt re-
cently purchased, the former
Continental Insurance Build-
ing on South Craig Street.

”This opportunity [to buy
the Continental Insurance
Building] came along fortui-
tously and we took advantage
of it. But these opportumtI€S

are pretty rare,” he explained.

Posvar also expressed con-
cern over the NCAA’s con-
sideration of Proposition 42. If
passed by the NCAA, this rul-
ing would prohibit athletic
scholarships for incoming stu-
dents who have not main-
tained a 2.0 grade-point
average and scored a mini-
mum of 700 on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test.

’’I think it's [Proposition 42]
terrible. It was misrepresented
as an attempt to raise stan-
dards. It didn’t raise standards.
It took a_n existing situation,
where we try to provide op-
portunity to a limited number
of students, and took their
scholarships away from them,
which is nothing but discrimi-
nation,” Posvar stated.

seems to cross into egotism. He
never falters, in front of universi-
ty officials, representatives of the
media, or his employees.

”We want to reduce fear,”
Brennan told the advisers of the
major student organizations, ”be-
cause the fear of crime is just as
important as the incidence of
crime.”

Brennan also informed the ad-
visers of another part of the plan.
He intends to form a Director's
Advisory Council, made up of
students and administration, to
bring campus concerns to him on
a regular basis. Other plans in-'
clude the installation of a ”hot
line” to his office.

’’I’d like to have some viable
suggestions from people on how
to improve the Campus Police,”
he said. ’’I hope to have a sugges-
tion box. lt’s critical that the stu-
dents feel we're their friends.”

Assistant Director Walter
Waters, who was acting director
before Brennan took over, echoes
Brennan's concerns about a pro-
gressive police force: ’’In the past,
the University of Pittsburgh
police department has been one
of the best campus police depart-
ments in the country. However,
we have not been as innovative

. as we could be.

”We have always been able to

Campus Police.

react to crime. Now‘ we want to
place emphasis on preventing it
before it happens. Improved
community relations are impera-
tive in order to achieve this.”

Though he is enthusiastic about
his new job, Brennan says it was
hard to leave his friends and fa-
mily in Philadelphia. He says he
is adjusting rapidly and enjoys
living in Pittsburgh.

Brennan was raised i‘n'South

I N 'I'llDEN'I'

Philadelphia, where his father
was a police officer. He jokes that
he is the ”stereotypical cop,” fol-
lowing in his father's footsteps.

’’I’m not a traditional police
chief, concerned only about ad-
ministrative issues. I am not go-
ing to run an isolated police

department. Ninety-nine percent_,§

of my job is communicating to
people, so we can prevent crimes
before they happen.”

System not to blame
for a few bad Greeks

Once again, fraternities are under heavy fire. Many
universities are considering whether or not to allow the
Greek system to continue to be a part of campus life.

Spurred by incidents of misconduct, alcohol abuse and
hazing, colleges like the University of Pennsylvania, Get-
tysburg College and IUP have been studying the problem,
and some have taken action against the Greeks. Franklin
and Marshall College has banned Greek groups altogether.

Fraternities now face a clear and present danger of be-
ing banned from many campuses. The National Interfrater-
nity Council is debating measures to control the problem,
such as national dry rush and abolishing the pledging
system. « -

While these two measures might be beneficial to the
Greek system, it is doubtful that it will stop the abuses.
The NIC already condemns hazing but is unable to stop
the fraternities that do.

Our own Greek system is an example of the solution
to the problem. An active and involved IFC, which urges
the Pitt fraternities to be responsible andhas strict guide-
lines for the fraternities to follow, can have a major impact.

The colleges which have abolished the Greek system -
have removed a valuable opportunity for students. Tradi-
tionally, the Greek system hasprovided its members with
healthy social interaction, academic support and have
done a significant amount of charity and social work for
the local communities. b

It would be unfair to blame the whole system for the
abuses of one or more chapters. Chapters which fail to
follow the regulations of the NIC and their respective
universities should be punished to the fullest extent of the
law. The system, however, should be allowed to continue.

No matter how vile, no man's deathshould

Bundy was a vile man, and

Poverty not easy to understand

I clearly remember the day
when the 25-year-old woman ap-
peared at my teller window. She
looked dragged and tired, and be-
side her were two small children,
unkempt and sorry-looking. She

handed me her welfare card. I‘

took it and went to the files. I
double-checked the
found nothing. The first thought
that ran througi my mind was

CAROLINE
REICH

that I did not want to be the one
to tell her that her check wasn”_t
there. I saw the look in her eyes
and knew I would be dealing
with a problem. I somehow
managed to say it. ”I’m sorry,
ma’am, we don't have your
check!’

She looked at me in disbelief.
”No check? You must have over-
looked it, please check again!”

I handed the card to the teller
next to me and asked her to
check it again. It was not there.
So, I called the Welfare Depart-
ment, and it told me she was not
going to get one. I was becoming
nervous. I knew how she would
react. I relayed the message to the

young woman. She was irate and ,

began to yell, then cry. I thought
this might happen, but there was
nothing I could have done to pre-

_ Wisdom, where has it gone?

The. Pitt News published two
articles on Ian. 16, entitled, ”The
evil that men do...” and ”...isn’t
worth wasting my breath on,”
which aroused considerable in-
terest among my colleagues here
at Pitt. [...] ‘

We, as regular readers of The
Pitt News, submit this response
to the two above-mentioned ar-
ticles.

Scenario: I am 6 years old.
Since the time I took my first solo
step, my parents warned me not

to go into the street because I '

may be struck by an automobile
and possibly be injured or killed.

 Now, my softball rolls out
into the street, and, being the pre-
cocious possessor of wisdom that

I am, I check first to see if my par-

ents are watching. Then, secure
in the knowledge that they are_
not, I proceed to retrieve that

list and

vent it. I looked over to the other
tellers for support. They were
making a conscious effort to ig-
nore me. ‘My supervisor was
standing nearby, and I_ knew she
was watching me.

The young woman proceeded
to tell me that she did not even
have a quarter to make a phone
call. As the tears were running
down her face, she told me that

- she had just spent her last few

dollars bringing herself and her
childern to the bank. At the time
I was thinking about how at least
three or more times a week some
impoverished person had a story
of misfortune and anguish to tell
me about. I also knew that some
of these people would moan
about how broke they were and
then take their welfare check and
waste it completely on alcohol or
drugs.

This woman did not seem to fit
into that category for me.

"My boss decided to come over
and explain to the woman that
she was sorry but there was noth-
ing more the bank could do. I
knew that my boss was being
sympathetic, but that somehow
did not make me feel any better.
My boss quickly walked away,
leaving the woman standing at
my window in a dazed state. -I
knew she was desperate. I also
knew that I could not let her walk

When I finally regain cons-
ciousness in the hospital, verita-
ble fount of knowledge that I am,
I begin to ponder the avenues of
recourse now available to me.
[...]

I can ascribe to the ”John Berg-
er” school of thought, i.e. — even
though my predicament is by my
own doing —_with the possible
consequences of my action
known beforehand... it's not my
fault. You see, I) My forefathers
and parents helped tocreate this
atmosphere (the world) into
which I was brought; 2) I am their
responsibility, for they created
me; 3) They should have made
sure that my world was totally
safe and carefree before conceiv-
ing me; 4) Therefore, it's my par-
ents’ fault I am where I am, and

away‘ without helping her in ‘

some way. My conscience would

~ not allow that.

I reached into my bookbag and
pulled out my lunch money. I

handed her the five ones. Thisg

was strictly against bank policy.
I told her,”This should get you to

the Welfare Department.” She _

thanked me graciously and left
with her children. I was tem-
porarily relieved that the scene
was over. However, I was also
saddened by her situation and the
fact that I could not do anything-
more to help her. i u -

Why did I feel guilty? Perhaps?!

the reason is that I have never
truly been in need. I most likely
will always have food, clothing

and shelter, and she may not. My ‘

father has always had an income
-that could support ou_r family of
seven in a very comfortable style.
I could always expect the use of
a car, and taking public transpor-
tation was always a last resort-.

Lauderdale was what I consi-
dered a time of need. This, in ac-
tuality, was the reason why I felt
guilty. Now that I look back, I am
still unable to relate to this wom-
an’s problem. I suppose this is
what bothers me themost. _

and four administrations later,
women still possess this right.

a punk clothing store in down-
town Philadelphia.

My friends and I noticed her

The light at the end of the tun-
nel loomed even closer when
another self-proclaimed pro—lifer
was elected as president of the
United States. Just last week,
George Bush attempted to ingrati-
ate himself with the right-to—lifers.
He has chosen a pro-life vice
president, and on Jan. 22, the
16th anniversary of Roe vs.
Wade, Bush told a crowd of pro-
lifers, ’’I think  Roe vs. Wade
was wrong and should be over-
turned.” _

A major snag in the Bush ad-
ministration deepened recently,
however, when Dr. Louis’ Sul-
livan, who was appointed to
head the Health and Human Ser-
vices Department, revealed that
he personally supports a wom-
an's right to an abortion.

sition outside of the president and

tional policy toward abortion,

extremist dictator. After Franco's
reign, a liberal government was
established. Discotecas ‘opened
and, thrived as the Spanish
danced and drank and ”ﬁesta-ed”
all night long. Since there is no
drinking age or closing hour in
Spain, people of all ages are at
liberty to dance and‘party ’til
dawn. There are no ordinances to
prohibit alcohol consumption in
public, so it is common to see
groups of youths partying in the
street unharassed.

Unlike most Americans, the
Spanish have common sense and
self-discipline. They consume
their intoxicants in moderation
and know how to pace them-
selves. They are ‘outito have a
good time instead oftrying to see
how smashed they can get. Alco-
holics and sloppy drunks are a
rarity. ,

Hashish smoking is socially ac-

, ceptable. The Spanish police are

accountable to the liberal ad-
ministration in charge,.-and that

just‘ doesn't make policy good
sense to have a Cabinet secretary
who is at odds with the way the
president wants things done.

Hopefully, all questions will be
answered this spring when the
Supreme Court will hear an ap-
peal by Missouri officials who
have written a law which tightly
restricts abortions. Abortion ad-
vocates feel that the Supreme
Court might use the case to over-
turn Roe or at least scale away
some of its provisions. Let us
hope so.

Everybody seems to be riding
the abortion bandwagon. To be
completely neutral on the subject
is to be neutral about your own
life .— everybody has his opinion.
Last week, The Pittsburgh Press,
ever careful not to step on any
toes, stated that abortion should
not be used as birth control but
should still be a woman's right.

All the while that was happen-
ing, women were taking to Pitts-
burgh's boulevards and avenues,

clutching hangers, crying out that.

I handed her my $5 bill, still
convinced that she could only
guess my future. She lit a cigarette
and looked deeply into my palm.
After a few minutes of silence,
she told me who I was and where
I was going. ’

She held my hand as she spoke
and her words opened up
thoughts -and-questions that Lhad
buried beneath my daily life. She
seemed to know exactly who I
was, what I was afraid of and
what I hoped to be. She told me
my future and I» believed her. I

"could .have listened to her for

hours but unfortunately, ’ my
wallet was empty.

My friends and I left her home,
comparing our futures and debat-
ing the truth in her prophecies.

Five years havepassed since
then, and I wonder where Ma-
dame Louise is. -

I passed by her building recent-
ly. A ”For Rent” sign replaced her
neon name in the third—floor win-
dow. I suppose she just went out
of business.

is why the police ignore drugs
when they encounter them. The
Spanish police are more con-
cerned with real crime, like peo-
ple carrying knives or guns.
Members of the National Rifle As-
-sociation might not feel at home
in Spain, but women and victims
of violent crime would feel very
safe, since violence is another rar-
ity. Spain is a very safe country.

Music is no rarity, however.’

Music animates the Spanish soul.
Spain has been dancing to lively
flamenco guitar music since the
Middle Ages, when the-rest of Eu-
rope was somber and silent.
Spanish discos are not trendy,
flashy and full of hype like Ameri-
can discos. Discotecas in Spain
are not a fad, but an institution.
They are where boy’ meets girl.
They serve a valuable function in
Spanish society. It's a cliche to
say ’_’Disco sucks" or ”Tired of
the bar scene?” in America. So
where do Americans go} to meet
people? Your guess: as..-as. good» as

an overturn of Roe would force
women into seeking back-alley
abortions. These are the same fa-
natics who decried the right-to-
life movement for using ”scare
tactics” in order to frighten them
out of committing infanticide.
The culmination of this recent
obsession for abortion occurred
last Monday in The Pitt News,
when a reporter interviewed a
13-year-old pro-choice girl.
The fact that this propaganda-
fed child feels that she is old
enough to fully comprehend that
the stand she is taking is outra-
geous. Even her statements ring
out the wordsof wide-eyed im-
’ maturity: ”I would consider hav-
ing an abortion if I thought- I
wouldn't be a good mother.” No-
tice this girl doesn’t say if she
were raped or poor, or in danger
of dying — all bastions of the pro-
choice movement — just if she
wouldn't be a good mother.
Abortion is more than a moral
issue, it is a constitutional one as
well. Feminists say it is their right

.Modern world lacks some of the mysteries of life

plex world? .2
Before the age of science, peo-
ple thrived on the theories of des-
tiny and omniscient spirits. Our
appreciation of this culture has
been reduced to brief horoscopes
in the back pages of newspapers.
We have gained a better under-_
standing of the world's operation

by sacrificing its mystery.

I find my future "now as more
of a job hunt than that of Ma-
dame Louise's intriguing vision.
My future options are accounted

{ for by a modern economic sys- ,

tem, and I am free to choose
among a variety of markets. It is
a simple, well-constructed and
somewhat boring process.

The structure of our society has

ness in Spain, due to the discos.

The Spanish grow up much '

more quickly than Americans do.
Groups of 16-year-old girls hang
out at discos and bars, flirting
with boys..By age 18, they are
looking for a husband. In Ameri-
ca, men and women have to wait
until they are 21 just to get into
a nightclub.

‘It is unfortunate that all the.
Spanish know about us is what is
shown inour TV and movies.
The Spanish idealize California,

‘once a Spanish colony, and many

want to come to America to live
because of what they see on TV.
The America they describe to me
is a different one than the one I
know. -

Another revealing difference

between America and Spain is

people's attitudes toward beg-
gars. In Spain, begging is recipro-
cated charity, a Christian notion

 Pro—abortion law the death penalty for the unborn

to do what they want with their
bodies. However, one of the bas- » » 
ic constitutional principles is that

one’s rights must not be allowed

to infringe upon the rights of
others. Whether you call it a’
baby, fetus, embryo, or whatever,

the fact is that human life plus hu-

man life can only beget human

life. '
The right to life must be pro-
tected above the woman’s right A
to have ”freedom of choice.” If
she were given the right to make
that choice, she would deprive
the right of a baby to live. Accord-
ing to the Constitution, your I
rights end when they over-
shadow those of another.

Wildcats defeat Panthers with WaIker’s last minute shot

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

VILLANOVA — As has hap-
pened a number of times this sea-
son, the Pitt Panther basketball
team had a game well in hand
but couldn't put their opponent
away (remember Siena on Nov.
28, among others). This time, it
was Big East rival Villanova who
was able to battle back against
the Panthers for a 79-78 win.

With 44 seconds left Saturday
night, Pitt center Bobby Martin
sunk two very big free throws to
give Pitt a 78-77 lead. The Wild-
cats set up to take the last shot
and started to pass the ball
around in hopes that something
would open up.

Point guard Kenny Wilson
wanted to pass the ball in to

I 7-foot center Tom Greis, but he

came out too high and Wilson
dished it off -to forward Doug
West. West drove the lane and
then passed it to freshman Chris
Walker. Time was running out
and the 6,500 people in atten-
dance started counting down the
seconds. When they got to 17,
they stopped as an off-balance
shot by Walker hit nothing but
net.

”We were trying to isolate
Greis, then get a double-down
screen for Doug West,” ’Nova
Coach Rollie Massimino said as

' he lit an inch—thick victorycigar.

”They either had to play Tom or
Doug. Doug took the ball inside
and he passed it to Chris. He then
made the shot.”

That left Pitt with 15 seconds to
win the game. Guard Sean Miller
brought the ball up the court and
looked to pass it to Brian Short-
er. Shorter didn't have a chance.
So the ball was passed outside to
Jason Matthews; Greis came out;
and Matthews passed it to center
Bobby Martin.

The crowd had again begun to
count off the seconds, and Mar-
tin got the ball on the count of
two. He dropped the ball, picked
it up and tried to dribble it inside.
There wasn't enough time left,
and Pitt had fallen.

”We wanted to get the ball in-
side to Shorter or a shot for Mat-
thews at the top of the foul line,’’
Pitt Coach Paul Evans said. ”Ja—

son didn't really have a shot, and

I think Sean waited just a little too
long to see if he could get the ball
to Shorter before they reversed
it”

As a result, the Panthers fell to
10-8, 3-4 in Big East play. The
Wildcats improved to 12-8 and
3-3.

”l thought this was a heck of a
college game,” Massimino said.
”We went at it like we are sup-
posed to. It was a game this time
between two teams, not against
two separations of church and
state, so to speak.” ’

Massimino was talking about
the confrontations he has had
with Evans over the last few sea-
sons.

’’I thought it was a good
game,” Evans said. ’’I thought we
beat ourselves by missing foul
shots [Pitt shot 22 of 36 from the
line for a 61 percent clip]; we had
too many turnovers [18], and I
think we gave them four offensive
rebounds that resulted in buckets
in the second half. You can't do
those things, and hope to win
games.”

’ By the looks of the first half, it
was Pitt's game to win. Miller tied
the game with his first of five
three-pointers on the night, and

the Panthers took control.

Pitt pushed its lead to nine
points when Matthews hit a 22-.
footer from the baseline shortly
after the 12-minute mark. The
Wildcats were "stunned but not
out. They stayed with Pitt, and
the lead didn't get bigger than 11.

”We were able to keep our
composure,” Wilson said. ”Our
defense kicked in when it was
needed.”

Martin's free throw that gave
Pitt its biggest lead seemed to
give life to the Wildcats. They
suddenly went on an 11-point
run, and it was now Pitt who
looked stunned. _

Yet, the Panthers regrouped to
score the last five points (three
resulting from foul shots) and give
Pitt a 37-32 lead at halftime.

”At times,” Evans said, ”it

seemed like every time that we"

would score, they would answer
with ease.”

Pitt was led by Shorter’s 19
points and seven rebounds.
Shorter played well despite a very

Jason Matthews and the rest of the Panthers just couldn't keep Villanova down Saturdaypight...

hostile crowd that chanted
”S.A.T.” every time he touched
the ball. ltwas also Shorter’s first
game in Philadelphia since his
junior year in high school.

’’I think Shorter played a great
game just coming back,” Mas-
simino said.

Pitt came out at the start of the
second half much the same as in
the first stanza. They ran the ball
well and stretched their lead to
seven when Shorter sunk two free
throws. » . .

But again, ‘Nova went on a
run, tying the game less than a

minute later. It was touch and go
from there on out.

The Wildcats would go up by
three and then Pitt would cut it
back. Through it all, the Panthers
didn't get the lead back until "the
last minute and then lost it on
‘Walker's shot.

LS U puts on a show in packed Superdome

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

0 The Georgetown Hoyas had
their sights set‘ on No. 1. The
Louisiana State Tigers wanted
nothing more than respect.

The Tigers got that respect and
more, when they upset the
second-ranked Hoyas 82-80 on
Saturday before the largest crowd
ever to witness an NCAA basket-
ball game.

LSU Coach Dale Brown decid-
ed long before his team ever took
the floor against Georgetown that
this would be the pinnacle of col-
lege hoops —— a ”spectacle,” as
he called it at one point during
the game.

The Louisiana Superdome was
renovated to seat an all-time
record 66,144 fans, including
media members, breaking the
previous mark of 57,607 in the
1987 NCAA Championship

‘ game between: Indiana and

Syracuse.

The actual attendance was
54,321, but even no-shows count
toward attendance figures, as
long as the tickets have been
sold. .

LSU upped its record to 14-5,
while Georgetown lost for only
the second time in 17 games.

0 Other action involving Big
East teams:
l3Ninth—ranked Seton Hall bom-
barded Boston College 103-79 at

East Rutherford, N.J., to raise its
league record to 5-2 and overall
ledger to 18-2.‘

The Eagles fell to 8-9, 1-6 in the
conference. Their lone league

victory was a 95-83 upset at Pitt. .

NCAA
ROUNDUP

l:lLed by Cliff Robinson's 22
points, Connecticut breezed past
St. John's, 80-52, for its first win
over the Redmen since January of
1981. '

UConn improved to 11-5, 3-4,
while the Redmen fell to 12-6,
4-4.

St. John's played without lead-
ing scorer Jayson Williams, who
was forced to sit out a conference
game due to league rules after
fighting with Georgetown’s John
Turner last week. _
l:lSenior point guard Sherman
Douglas tied an NCAA record
with 22 assists as 13th-ranked
Syracuse edged No. 19 Provi-
dence 100-96.

Douglas became the Big East's
all-time leading assist man with
352, bettering by 10 the record
of departed St. John's guard Mark
Jackson.

Forward‘ Stephen Thompson
led the Orangemen with a career-
high 29 points as Syracuse im-
proved to 17-4, 4-3. Providence

fell to 15-2.

0 West Virginia is making its
move to become one of the top
20 programs in the country. With

its 98-82 victory over hapless Du-

quesne at the A.J. Palumbo

Center on Saturday, the Moun- .

taineers ran their win-streak to 14
games, tied with Louisville for the
nation's longest.

The ’Eers improved to 15-2,
and 9-0 in the Atlantic 10, which
has been dominated by the Tem-
ple Owls in recent years. WVU

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, January 30, I989

Swim team thrives on divers’ competition

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Most good sports teams have a
successful one—two punch.
However, Pitt's men's diving
team uses a one—three punch.
More specifically, it's a
I-meter/3—meter punch with John
Sharkey and Vernon Yenick.

The duo has dominated for Pitt
this season, combining to win ev-
ery diving event in every meet
but one. When one of them wins,
the other usually finishes second.

Winning is one of the only
things these two have in com-
mon, however. Their diving

styles and their personalities are ,

radically different. Sharkey is
regarded as an aggressive, power-
ful diver, while Yenick uses more
finesse and grace. -

While the two are not best of
friends, they still respect and pull
for each other while diving.

”We get along fine. We have
our differences, but it's nothing
that gets in the way of diving,”
said Yenick.

"We’re very competitive. I'm
sure it gets him mad when I beat
him, and it doesn't make me hap-
py when he beats me, but I don't
get upset because he's an excel-
lent diver,” added Yenick.

Diving coach Julian Krug
agreed that the two are very com-
petitive.

"They definitely push each
other and don't mind beating
each other,” Krug said. "Each of
them wants to get better and be
the best diver on this team.

”John I see as a competitor,

,5 and a good competitor wants to

win. Anybody who stands in the
way can't be considered a partic-
ularly close friend, but the com-
petition is healthy, and they do
pull together as part of the

University of Pittsburgh diving -

team.”

It was this competitiveness that
led Sharkey, a redshirt sopho-
more, to three straight state div-
ing championships and a state
record his senior year at Loyola
High School in Baltimore.

After such an illustrious career,
Sharkey chose to come to Pitt
over several other schools. He
picked Pitt because he liked the
facilities and because he had a
good relationship. with Krug,
whom he had met in his junior
yean '

While diving for Pitt as a fresh-

man two years ago, Sharkey was -

hampered by eight shoulder dis-
locations. He still managed to
win the Big East Championship in
the I-meter event and finish third
in the 3—meter.

He decided to have an opera-
tion on his shoulder over the
Thanksgiving break of 1987.

Sharkey was redshirted and out of -

competition for nine months,
which included several months
of therapy.

"Sitting out is no fun. You've

got to appreciate someone who's ~

redshirting. It's a lot harder than
people would think it is because
the rehab is endless,” said
Sharkey.

His first meet afterward was the
Senior National prequalifications
last summer. The top four finish-
ers went on to the National
Championships in California to
compete against the likes of Greg
Louganis. Sharkey finished fifth.

”That was my first meet back"

after my operation, so I was hap-
py"with it," said Sharkey, who

‘ hopes to I-mprovethat finish this I

summer.‘  

Krug pointed out that Sharkey
is committed to improving and is
especially good at creating a
mental image of a dive and then
doing it.

”He wants very badly to be the
best. He's willing to work and is
very quick to Iearn,” said Krug.

Sharkey said this year he is at-

tempting dives with a higher ‘-

degree of difficulty.

”I'm trying dives that I did two
years ago in tuck, only now I'm
trying them in pike position be-
cause they are’ worth more
points.”

Yenick’s rise to success has
been a lot quieter, but quicker
than Sharkey’s. Yenickdid not
start diving until the ninth grade,

almost IO years after Sharkey got
his start.

As a sophomore at Turtle Creek
High, Yenick joined the Pitt
Aquatic Club, where he was
coached by Krug. Two years
later, Yenick finished second in
the state championships.

Yenick chose Pitt because he
wanted to go to a Division I
school that was close to home
and also because of his good rap-
port with Krug.

He has made the Big East
Championship finals six times in
the past three years and, along
with Sharkey, will undoubtedly
add two more times to his record.

This past summer, Yenick also
competed in the Senior National

prequals, where he finished
seventh. This year he hopes to
qualify for the NCAA finals as
well as the Senior National finals
before he graduates with a com-
munications degree in De-
cember.

While Yenick’s approach to
diving is the opposite of Shar-
key’s, he has been just as suc-
cessful.

"Vernon is far more aesthetic.
He's a pretty diver. He won't do
the big, hard dives; he will do less
difficult ones, but he will do them
very precisely and very well and
rip entries very well,” said Krug.

”I’ve been told that I'm grace-
ful. That's a big part of diving,
that's where you get the big

points. If you dive and rip it [not ,

make a big splash], but it looks

really ugly in the air, they're only V

going to give you sixes. But if you
make it look good, they're going
to give you sevens or eights,"
said Yenick. ~

Krug agrees that despite the 4
different styles, the two have the :
capabilities to go very far this

year. ~

"They will likely dominate the
Big East Championships; it's very
likely that they'll trade off firsts

and seconds as they have been all I

year,” said Krug, who added that

they also have a chance to do ,

well at the Eastern Seaboard
Championships in March and the
NCAAs in April.

Center Greis makes claim for the
big man in guard heavy Big East

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

VILLANOVA — It seems as
though every Big East team has a
superstar guard who excites the
crowd with his three-point bombs
and dazzling steals. He, there-
fore, also grabs most of the me-
dia attention.

But what about real basketball?
Big men swatting shots away with
force, jamming one home leaving
the backboard shaking, and fight-
ing for position underneath; now

that’s basketball. That's what fans
want to see. Or at least that’s the
way some people see it.

Saturday night, in Villanova’s
79-78 victory over Pitt, Tom
Greis, Villanova’s 7—foot-3 center,
made a statement for the big men
of the guard—rich Big East con-
ference.

Greis, a junior, scored 25
points in the game, 17 coming in
the second half, and pulled down
five rebounds. It was not a typi-
cal game for Greis against Pitt.

Last year, Greis averaged 13.4
points and 4.5 rebounds in the
two regular season meetings be-
tween the two teams.

In the first half, Greis seemed
to be on pace for those average
numbers, as Pitt center Bobby

Martin wouldn't let Greis take
control of the inside game. Greis
went into the locker room at half-
time with only eight points and
just one rebound.

”In the beginning of the first
half, it seemed like he was some-
what overpowered,” said Vil-
Ianova head coach Rollie
Massimino.

Massimino must have given
Greis a good pep talk at halftime,
because Greis was red hot the
second half and took control of
the inside game.

”I just said to myself, ’Enough
is enough. I have to get into the
game,’ ” said Greis. ’’I was a lit-
tle out of the game mentally, and
I took a new attitude on for the
second half.”

It turned out to be a problem
for Pitt Coach Paul Evans and the
rest of the Panthers.

”He had a terrific night,” said
Evans. ”Every time we didn't
front him, he got the ball and
scored.

”I think he wears Bobby down
a little bit. In the first half, Bobby
could get around and front him.
In the second half he couldn't get
around him as well."

But who could blame Martin?

Greis is halfa foot tallerthan Mar— _

Lady Panthers defeat Georgetown (3.-eis

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

It's been a long time in coming,
but Pitt's wOmen’s basketball
coach Kirk Bruce may have found
some sort Of spark to drag his
squad Out Of the bottom of the
Big East cellar.

On Saturday afternoon at Fitz-
gerald Field House, the Lady Pan-
thers (now 10-9 Overall, 3-6 in the
Big East), handled an upstart

Georgetown team (10-8, 4-5) to’

the tune of a 72-58 victory, and
in the process broke a streak that
saw them lose seven Of their last
eight games.

”We knew it was going to be
a tough game,” Bruce said. ”But
we also felt like we absolutely
had to win this game, and I think
we played like we had to win this
game.” .

Pitt forward Lorri Johnson saw
to that early On, scoring 10 of her
team's first 14 points from avari-
ety of positions On the court.
From there, Pitt managed to hang
tough with Georgetown before
producing a game—deciding 7-0
streak late in the half.

Point guard Shaunda Byrd start-
ed the key run by converting one
Out Of two free throws with just
Over three minutes left in the first
half. Johnson then scored the
next two points on a pull-up jum-
per and a pair of free throws.

Lady Panther Amy Holman
completed the seven-point Out-
burst with a basket underneath to
give her team a 35-26 lead.

Pitt never trailed after that, and
the lead swelled to 20 with 8:26
left in the second halfon a three-
point play by Johnson. George-
town managed to battle back
slightly from that point On, but it
cO_uld only narrow the margin to

- nine points with just under three

minutes left.
V The fact that the visitors never
got closer made as strong an im-
pression on Bruce as did his
team’s play during the first three-
fourths Of the game.

”We got loose balls and we
were really aggressive,” Bruce
said. ”At crucial times in the

game, we did some things right,-

which we haven't been doing.
”They got it down to nine, but

then we answered back. The big

thing was we made free throws

at the end Of the game to put it
away,” Bruce added.

Lady Panther guard Jennifer
Shingler was Bruce's ”Miss
Clutch” for the evening, hitting
six foul shots in the waning mo-
ments of the game for the final
margin of victory. She finished
with 19 points on the evening, in-
cluding 11 of 14 from the foul
line.

The games don't get any easi-
er for Pitt, as perennially power-
ful Villanova will travel to the
Field House in a Big East contest
Wednesday night.

”This could be the game that
could make us think we can com-
pete in this league,” Bruce said.
”We may be able to put a streak
together now.”

Bruce is just hoping it won't be
like the one he has experienced
this past month.

Continued from page 12
bench, was On the court for 39
minutes of the highly intense
game.

The resting showed particular-
ly late in the game as Greis
scored 11 Of Vil|anova’s last 18
points. But Greis insists Villano-
va didn't alter its game plan for
his hot hand.

”There wasn't any special at-
tention to [give] me the ball,” said
Greis. ”| just opened up the spots
and the guys got me the ball in
great position. From there, I had
to put the ball in the basket."

He was also exceptionally
tough on defense during that
time. His intimidating presence
around the basket On defense
practically put the Panthers’ in-
side scoring game on the endan-
gered list.

Over the last 13 minutes, Pitt
managed only four points from

inside the key. Porter and Miller
had to pick up the scoring burden
for Pitt with |Ower—percentage
outside shooting.

Quite a big difference from last
year when Pitt's Charles Smith
and Jerome Lane pretty much
controlled Greis and held him to
mediocre stats.

”Charles was a big difference,”
said Greis. ”[Pitt’s] frontline this
year plays well and they're talent-
ed, but they're not as big as
Charles. They're not as intimidat-
ing as Charles either, so I just did
my thing."

With a night like Greis had
against Pitt, it looked like a Big
East center was going to get some

_we|l-deserved media attention. »

But in the locker room, the crowd
of reporters centered on freshman
guard Chris Walker, who scored
the last points with_17 seconds
left.

Louisville
losses to
Ohio State

By Ted M. Natt Jr.

Associa ted Press Writer

LOUISVILLE, Ky. —Jay Bur-
son scored 29 points and No.
17 Ohio State rallied Sunday
for an 85-79 victory over No.
3 Louisville, which lost center
Pervis Ellison to a knee injury
just before halftime.

The loss snapped Louis-
ville's 14-game winning streak
and likely prevented the Cardi-
nals, 14-3, from taking over‘
the No. 1 spot in the Associat-
ed Press Poll; Top—ranked ll-
linois and No. 2 Georgetown
had lost earlier in the week.

Ellison, the team's leading H
scorer and rebounder,
sprained the medial collateral
ligament in his left knee while
scrambling for a loose ball and
had to be helped offthe court.
He had scored six points up to
that point.

Kenny Klein, Louisville's
sports information director,
said there apparently was no
tear of the ligament, and he
did not know if Ellison would
be hospitalized.

Ohio State, which trailed
51-41 early in the second half,

the game, 68-67, on Burson’s
driving layin with 4215 re-
maining.

Burson and Eli Brewster
then hit jump shots to cap a
13-3 outburst that gave the
Buckeyes a 72-67 advantage at

the 3:22 mark. J

The dog days of January are
taking their toll both emotional-
ly and physically on the Pitt
wrestling team, but the Panthers
continue to add to the win
column in spite of it.

”This is a tough time of the sea-
son for everybody,” head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said.

The Pitt wrestling team was able t

 
 

”We’re midway through the
season, but we can't quite see the
light at the end of the tunnel,
which makes things difficult. I
think we'll continue to pick up as

time goes on even as the compe— .
tition becomes increasingly _

difficult.” -

Pitt defeated the Navy Middies
Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field
House, 22-20, in spite of the fact
that the team only won four of the
10 matches.

Stottlemyer said, ”What can I
say — it wasn't one of the better
matches we've wrestled, but it's
a win and we'll take it.”

The Panthers pushed their

0 get by the Middies, but now have to get ready to travel to Bloom

Wrestlers hand defeat to Na

record to 8-1-1 overall while re-
maining 1-1 in Eastern Wrestling
League competition.

Pitt's 118-pounder, Bob Simp-
son, continues to be an integral
part of the Panther lineup. He
pinned his opponent to start Pitt
off with a comfortable 6-0 lead.

Scott Hovan (150) sat out_the
last match against Cleveland
State, but Saturday night he
demonstrated his prowess in his
division with yet another Panther
pin.

The midseason blues have

produced several confidence
crises within the Panther squad,
